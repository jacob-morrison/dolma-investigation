{"text": "Yuan fall &lsquo; to help put lid on HK inflation &rsquo;\n  \n\n\n By KENNETH KO and agencies  </h \n\n \n\nFINANCIAL Secretary Hamish Macleod expects the Chinese currency  ' s\ndecline in value to help ease inflationary pressures in Hongkong . \n\n \n\nOn a three-day visit to Tokyo , Mr Macleod said the yuan  ' s fall\nwould have a \" rather helpful effect in keeping inflation down &rdquo;\nin Hongkong by reducing the cost of imports from China , the territory  ' s\nbiggest trading partner . \n\n \n\nHis remarks came a day after Hongkong share prices tumbled two per\ncent in the wake of China  ' s decision to let the yuan float freely at its\ncurrency swap centres , triggering a sharp decline of more than 20 per cent\nagainst the US dollar . \n\n \n\nMr Macleod said he was unsure of Beijing  ' s motives but noted that\ncurrency convertibility was a prerequisite for becoming a member of the\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) , which China\nhopes to re-enter . \n\n \n\nHe said : \" I  ' m not sure myself whether we  ' re seeing a\ndeliberate step or whether we  ' re seeing a short-term reaction &rdquo; to\ndisparities between official and unofficial exchange rates for the yuan .\n\n\n \n\n\" I don't think there  ' s any consensus yet about what it\nexactly means . \n\n \n\n\" China  ' s action effectively removed the ceiling of eight\nyuan to the dollar at currency swap centres .\n\n\nThe yuan fell to 10.23 to the US dollar at the swap centre in\nShanghai on Thursday . \n\n \n\nThe official rate used by banks , however , remained at 5.7 yuan\nto the dollar . \n\n \n\nHowever , Mr Macleod reiterated that the Hongkong dollar would\nremain pegged to the US currency , despite the resulting constraints on using\ninterest rates as a means of cooling inflation , which is forecast to reach\nalmost 10 per cent this year . \n\n \n\n\" We can't basically use the interest rate weapon , &rdquo;\nhe said .\n\n\n\" That  ' s a price that we accept because we don't really see\nany other option . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nAddressing a luncheon meeting of the Foreign Correspondents Club\nin Tokyo , Mr Macleod painted a rosy picture of Hongkong  ' s future . \n\n \n\nHe highlighted the territory  ' s airport project in his speech ,\nsaying that 25 contracts worth more than US&dollar;4.4 billion had so far\nbeen awarded including the site preparation contract for the airport . \n\n \n\nSo far , Japanese companies had captured the largest share of\nthese contracts , accounting for 22 per cent by value , &dollar;945 million .\n\n\n \n\n\" We are now engaged in discussions with China on the\nfinancing arrangements for the new airport and the airport railway .\n\n\nHopefully , these will be successful , &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\nMr Macleod told the audience in Tokyo that Hongkong  ' s gross\ndomestic product had been forecast to grow by five per cent a year in real\nterms . \n\n \n\nHongkong also enjoyed effective full employment and the stock\nmarket was booming , although inflation posed a problem . \n\n \n\nNoting the growth of economic ties with China , Mr Macleod said\nHongkong accounted for about 70 per cent of foreign investment in China while\nChina  ' s investment in Hongkong was estimated to have exceeded &dollar;12\nbillion . \n\n \n\n\" It is this role -; the role of helping in China  ' s\neconomic liberalisation and benefitting from China  ' s economic progress\n-; that particularly inspires confidence and optimism in Hongkong  ' s\nfuture , &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\n\" We are in good shape .\n\n\nWe are confident that Hongkong will continue to be in good shape\nafter 1997 . &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n\n Taiwan stocks up for grabs   \n\n\n By KENNETH KO  </h \n\n \n\nTAIWAN Securities , the first securities firm from the island to\nset up in Hongkong , is seeking to put local capital into the Taiwan stock\nmarket . \n\n \n\nTaiwan Securities ( HK ) began work at the end of\nlast month after winning the approval of the Securities and Futures\nCommission to provide securities trading , investment and corporate advice\nservices . \n\n \n\nManaging director Chin Cheng-sin said his firm was keen to sell\nTaiwan financial commodities to Hongkong investors , but that required\npermission from the SFC and Taiwan  ' s Securities and Exchange Commission\nbecause Taiwan  ' s central bank controlled the flow of foreign capital into\nthe island . \n\n \n\nMr Chin said the SEC had in principle approved movement of\nHongkong capital by Taiwan Securities ( HK ) into the island  ' s\nsecurities industry , but it had yet to work out how shares bought should be\ntraded . \n\n \n\nHongkong  ' s SFC also required the firm to meet criteria to ensure\nprotection of investors buying shares  \n\n \n\n\n More top-grade office Space Forecast to go vacant  \n\n\n\n By KENNETH KO  \n\n \n\nTHE vacancy rates of top-grade offices will rise to about 11.9\nper cent by the end of the year because of oversupply , says property agent\nRichard Eills . \n\n \n\nIn its regional office market report it said the territory  ' s\noffice vacancy rates now stood at nine per cent , compared with 7.5 per cent\nsix months ago . \n\n \n\nOnly 66 per cent of the total new office supply of 1.87 million\nsq ft in the past six months had been taken up , it said , while rentals had\nfallen by about six 10 per cent . \n\n \n\nAt the end of last month , total prime officer space was about\n31.9 million sq ft . \n\n \n\nOf this total , Central accounted for about 44 per cent with 14.1\nmillion sq ft . \n\n \n\nRichard Ellis expects 6.5 million sq ft of top-grade office space\nto come on stream over the next two years . \n\n \n\nThe bulk of the new supply would by in Wan Chai and Causeway Bay\n, with only 1.9 million sq ft projected to be a available in core and\nperipheral Central . \n\n \n\nIn Tsim Sha Tsui , the third traditional office location , about\n1.5 million sq ft of prime office accommodation is scheduled to come on to\nthe market . \n\n \n\n\" The increased level of new supply , in Wan Chai and\nCauseway Bay in particular , is forecast to result in the continued downward\nadjustment of rents and prices , at least until mid-1992 , &rdquo; the agent\nsaid . \n\n \n\nMonthly rents for prime office square foot last month , down 23.2\nper cent from &dollar;56 a year earlier . \n\n \n\nThe report said top-grade office accommodation fetched a selling\nprice of about &dollar;5,300 a square foot . \n\n \n\nHowever , Richard Eills maintains that Hongkong remains an office\ninvestment market , offering opportunities for both institution and\nentrepreneurial investors . \n\n \n\nMeanwhile , a property consultant said the growing and ageing\npopulation was the \" invisible hand &rdquo; behind the residential\nproperty boom in the territory . \n\n \n\nMr Stephen Suen , the managing director Treasure Land Property\nConsultant , said the median age of the local population had risen from 26\nyears in 1981 to 32 , and more people were in their 30s when they were\nfinancially stronger .  \n\n \n\n\n ITDC board set to hold first meeting   \n\n\n By KENNETH KO  \n\n \n\nTHE recently-formed Industry and Technology Development Council\n( ITDC ) will hold its first board meeting on January 23 to map\nout its future plans , acting director-general of industry Wilfred Wong said\nyesterday . \n\n \n\nThe meeting would also form sub-committees and set out their\nrespective areas of responsibility , he said . \n\n \n\nMr Wong added that the findings of the year-long study on the\nchemical processing industry in Hongkong would be presented to the ITDC board\nmembers at the meeting . \n\n \n\nThe study was aimed at assessing the value of the chemical\nprocessing industry in Hongkong , where its factories were located , and the\ndemand for chemical products . \n\n \n\nThe ITDC , which came in existence on January 1 , is an advisory\nbody created by merging the existing Industry Development Board and the\nCommittee on Science and Technology . \n\n \n\nMr Wong said the body would comprise some 20 board members , of\nwhom six would be representatives of the Government.\n\n\nAlthough the names of the members have yet to be announced ,\nDirector-General of Industry Tyebjee Barma is expected to be one of them .\n \n\n \n\n\n Auctions of land raise &dollar;6.45b   \n\n\n By KENNETH KO  \n\n \n\nLAND sales at public auction have raised about &dollar;6.45\nbillion for the Government so far this financial year , against &dollar;3.13\nbillion for the whole of the previous financial year . \n\n \n\nThe revenue , excluding that from sales by cash tender or land\nexchange entitlement tender , has already substantially surpassed the\nGovernment  ' s forecast for its land sale programme . \n\n \n\nThis year  ' s land sale programme originally covered 24.07\nhectares , but the Sino-British Land Commission recently released an\nadditional 5.9 hectares . \n\n \n\nSince April , a total of 16 plots of Crown land have been offered\nat land auctions -; including nine residential lots , five\nindustrial/godown lots , and two commercial lots . \n\n \n\nThe nine residential lots together raised nearly &dollar;5.64\nbillion or 87.4 per cent of the total for the year to date , reflecting the\nresidential boom and the fact that flats prices have surged by about 60 per\ncent in 1991 . \n\n \n\nFour of the residential sites auctioned were underutilised\ngovernment quarters , where the administration regarded as surplus to\nrequirements . \n\n \n\nA 95,800-square-foot residential site in Kong  ' s Park Rise , also\nGovernment quarters , will be auctioned in February . \n\n \n\nWhen the land sales programme was announced in March , it was\nforecast that the sale of five Government quarters sites would raise about\n&dollar;850 million &semi; with only four sold so far the total revenue is\nalready about &dollar;1.9 billion . \n\n \n\nOne of the most notable sales was the auction of a 229,811 sq ft\nresidential site in Tai Po in October , which was sold for &dollar;1.25\nbillion to a consortium of Realty Development Corp ( RDC ) ,\nSino Land and China Overseas Building Development ( COBC ) .\n\n\n \n\nAnother major sale was the auction of a 145,637 sq ft residential\nlot in Fanling in July , which was taken by Sino Land at a price of\n&dollar;1.01 billion . \n\n \n\nRDC , a subsidiary of World International ( Holdings\n) , and Sino Land virtually dominated the public auctions this year .\n\n\n \n\nRDC bought three sites , while Sino Land snapped up four sites on\nits own .\n\n\nThe two groups also teamed up to buy two sites , and they allied with\nCOBD to take two other sites . \n\n \n\nFor the remaining three months of this fiscal year , seven more\nlots of Crown land will be put up for public auction -; including four\nresidential lots . \n\n \n\nThe next public auction is due to take place on January 15 , with\na 59,578 sq ft commercial lot and a 3,731 sq ft residential lot on offer .\n \n\n \n\n\n SHK in land deal to extend Palm Springs   \n\n\n By KENNETH KO  \n\n \n\nSUN Hung Kai Properties is expanding its luxury residential\ndevelopment , Palm Springs , with the purchase of two million square feet of\nland in Yuen Long . \n\n \n\nA company spokesman yesterday confirmed the acquisition of\nadditional land in Wo Shang Wai to extend the Palm Springs project . \n\n \n\nShe said the purchase would allow the company to develop better\nsupport facilities for the low-density residential project , but declined to\nprovide details of the transaction . \n\n \n\nHowever , analysts say the additional land could provide a gross\nfloor area of 800,000 to one million square feet for residential use . \n\n \n\nPalm Springs comprises 1,200 three-storey garden houses of 1,200\nto 1,600 square feet each . \n\n \n\nThe residential project , costing more than &dollar;1 billion ,\ncurrently covers three million square feet of land in Wo Shang Wai , with a\nplot ratio of four . \n\n \n\nWith the additional two million square feet of land , Palm\nSprings will become one of the largest low-density residential developments\nin the territory . \n\n \n\nProperty analysts estimate that Sun Hung Kai is required to spend\na further &dollar;1 billion for the extension of Palm Springs .  \n\n \n\n\n Daily News chairman denies power struggle   \n\n\n By KENNETH KO  \n\n \n\nMAJOR shareholders of Hongkong Daily News and Trading Holding\nhave denied reports of a struggle for control of the publishing group . \n\n \n\nSpeaking after the company  ' s annual general meeting , chairman\nLaw Bun and vice-chairman Martin Kwok Ying-chuen both dismissed suggestions\nthey had engaged in a struggle for power . \n\n \n\nMr Law said the rumours were unfounded and emphasized that the\npublishing group remained intact . \n\n \n\nHe said he had no plans to increase his shareholding . \n\n \n\nMr Law holds about 164 million shares , representing about 14.4\nper cent of the company  ' s share capital . \n\n \n\nMr Kwok , who is the largest single shareholder in Hongkong Daily\nNews , also said he had no intention to sell his interest . \n\n \n\nHe said he treated his shareholding as a long-term investment .\n\n\n \n\nLolliman Holdings , controlled by Mr Kwok , owns about 388\nmillion shares , or 34.2 per cent of Hongkong Daily News . \n\n \n\nThe publishing group reported a loss before extraordinary items\nof &dollar;44.13 million for the year ended June , compared with earnings of\n&dollar;35.15 million previously . \n\n \n\nMr Law said the company  ' s furniture trading business was\nperforming well and it was planning to open a fourth furniture showroom in\nthe territory . \n\n \n\nBesides furniture trading , the group , which owns the\nChinese-language newspaper  Hongkong Daily News  , has also\ndiversified into radio paging .  \n\n \n\n\n Laws profit falls 37.1pc at interim   \n\n\n By KENNETH KO  \n\n \n\nTHE weak global economy depressed the profit of Laws\nInternational Holdings to &dollar;41.6 million for the six months ended\nSeptember , down 37.1 per cent from &dollar;66.2 million in the same period\nlast year . \n\n \n\nTurnover for the diversified garment manufacturer and retailer\nrose 5.9 per cent to &dollar;1.6 billion from &dollar;1.5 billion . \n\n \n\nEarnings per share fell to 7.6 cents from 12.1 cents . \n\n \n\nThe company will pay an interim dividend of three cents a share\n, against six cents previously . \n\n \n\nChairman Law Ting-pong said the group  ' s overall performance was\nstill hindered by the worldwide economic slowdown . \n\n \n\nHe said the long-expected recovery of the US economy did not\nmaterialise , and consumer spending had been slow . \n\n \n\nThe company  ' s manufacturing business recorded a good increment\nin sales to the US , and this division would maintain its profit contribution\n, he said . \n\n \n\nBut retailing arm Judy  ' s continued to operate at a loss under\nthe sluggish US retail environment . \n\n \n\nAs for the retailing business in Hongkong , Mr Law said high\ninflation and slow consumer spending affected its operation .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6f748322-9a5b-4cb8-b3a8-5c24c9d7b993", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.823643+00:00"}
{"text": "The public are not very enthusiastic about the decision making in\npublic affairs because they know that each outcome is resulted of thousands\nof vote .\n\n\nThe vote by him do not have much effect even he knows that one of the\nthousand people .\n\n\n Moreover , it is so costly to get\ninformation about  public affairs .\n\n\nSuch as they have to spend a lot of time to collect information about\ncandidates to verify their platforms whether   relevant\n or not .\n\n\nMeanwhile the candidates expect to attract the median Voter  ' s vote ,\ntheir platforms are quite similar to each other .\n\n\nIn addition , the public think that they only spend a few dollars for\ntax , it doesn't worth much to them .\n\n\nSo they don't care much about the public affair .\n\n\nMoreover , the public tend to be a free-rider that means someone get\nthe benefit without paying for it .\n\n\nAs someone can make choice for them , they can benefit from the\ndecision making . \n \n\nIn considering the &lsquo; one person one vote &rsquo; , there\noccurs rational ignorance .\n\n\nAs mentioned above , the public are not  \nenthusiastic  about the decision making in public affairs , they won't\ngather information at the same time , we assume that all the votes are equal\nweight ,  so   tyranny  of majority\nwill occur .\n\n\nBut it doesn't reflect the right choice by the majority ,\n\n\nit only means that the majority  overwhelm\nthe minority and the minority have to receive a negative externality that\nimpose by the majority .\n\n\nNegative externality means that a  cost\nimpose on the person that action done by others without the consent of the\nperson . \n \n\nIn addition , it costs a large of transaction cost if one person\none vote is taken place .\n\n\nFrom the optimal decision making rule , we find that more voter  involve in the process , the higher the decision\nmaking cost .\n\n\nAs &lsquo; one person one vote &rsquo; has got externality and high\ntransaction cost , so it is not economically efficient . \n \n\nIn the case of representative of functional constituencies\nbecause of they know that he would benefit from the election because they are\ninterest group that is one of the bureaux , they can get benefit from the tax\n, so they have interest to collect information . \n \n\nBut since they are bureaucrats , they have to keep their power\n&ampersand; prestige , so  their method to be budget\nmaximization.\n\n\nThat means they will often overestimate the demand &ampersand; supply\nmore than the market  demand so the consumer exert\nconsumer surplus from   bureaucrats  . \n \n\nAs the representatives comes from different parties , they have\nto sell their goodness &ampersand; struggle for the benefit , i.e. more\nbudget, e.g. the medical and Health Department said that they are important\n&ampersand; the hospital is overcrowding , so they  had to\nexpand the staff .\n\n\nIn other way , the social welfare Department, also claimed that they\nare underprivileged but overloaded .\n\n\nAs the special interest group has their own specialise &ampersand; no\nprivate sector can assess their outcome , so they have to expand the budget\nto show their importance &ampersand; publicize to the public about their job\nnature , so the representative of functional constituencies isn't\neconomically efficient also .  \n\n\n6 \n \n\nBesides the government provides social welfare activities , there\nare 4 ways that can take place the social welfare activities under the govt  ' s\nregulation . \n \n\nThe first one is the govt contract the govt can contract out some\nprojects to the private form to run urban Council is contract out to private\nsector the benefit is after the end of contract , if the contractor performed\ndissatisfaction the govt may terminate them .\n\n\nAs the contractor has to tender the contract , they would use the\nmost efficiency &ampersand; effective method to run the assignment then he\ncan reduce the cost that is more economically efficiency at the same time ,\nhe can gain the contract owing to the lowest price . \n \n\nMoreover ,  there is competition among\ncontractors so they could improve their service .\n\n\nThen it stimulate the contractor to work more efficiency . \n \n\nThe second one is the Voucher system , that the government can\ngive grant to voucher to private sector to run the welfare such as education\n, transport subsidies to full time students .\n\n\nThis aims at easy management to the government .\n\n\nIn USA the government gives voucher to the students of parents they\ncan choose which school they like and sent their children to it .\n\n\nThen the government will receive voucher from school and subsidy it .\n\n\nThe benefit of voucher system is attain the characteristics of public\nfinance but gain the advantage of provide sector .\n\n\nBecause in general , private sector works more \n efficiently  than the government .\n\n\nBecause they have comparison and is under a market mechanism . \n \n\nAnother one is the privatization .\n\n\none type that the HK government usually do is a Franchise .\n\n\nThat is allow a private sector works as a monopoly supplier but use\nregulation to restrict it .\n\n\nThe government will regulate it to guarantee the minimum standard of\nsupply  , though it works as a monopolist but the price is a\ncompetitive market price , for example , the MTR and Bus Company .\n\n\nThey are franchise in Hong Kong .\n\n\nBut they are work under government regulation . \n \n\nThe last one of privatization is the government owned property\nbut run by private firm ,\n\n\nin Hong Kong the KCR is the example . \n \n\nThough privatization work under a market mechanism and have\ncompetition among the same industry There are drawback of it .\n\n\nBecause of the competition , it reduce the firm  ' s  incentive to enter the firm to avoid extreme conflict .\n\n\nTo the consumer , competition is better .\n\n\nThey can benefit from the price .\n\n\nMoreover , the firm could respond to  \n consumer in case they have opinions . \n \n\nThe next , because private sectors run under the regulation .\n\n\nThe government has send a regulator to oversee the firms .\n\n\nThen the regulator became a   bureaucrat  ,\n\n\nit may exist problem in dealing with the private sector .\n\n\nThen it may also run off and then finally the private sector may be\nconverted back to public sector . \n \n\nLastly, the contract price to private sector  is\ndifficult to measure because of various types of services and goods .\n\n\nThe government should make a choice to decide .  \n\n\n7 \n \n\nAs cost-benefit analysis is a set of techniques that design to\nensure the scarce resources allocated  efficiently \n, we find to list out the steps to allocate public funds . \n \n\nFirstly , we should identify the objective , to tell the reason\nwhy do that project , not only the content of the \nproject , so that we have a Program-budget Planning and a Line-Program Budget .\n\n\nProgram budget is used to list out the expenditure of the objective .\n\n\nThe line-budget  break down the items for budgetting .\n\n \n\nSecondly , enumerate the cost &ampersand; benefit .\n\n\nWhenever we have a budget , not decide to do or not to do , also\ninclude where to do it and the Numbers of projects because each project has\ndifferent cost and benefits .\n\n\nwe can't just list out one project , but all program planning to\ncompare the cost and benefit .\n\n\nBe careful\n\n\nwe can easily overlook the benefit or double count the benefit . \n \n\nThirdly , it enumerate the options as one social welfare can many\nvariation to achieve , we should name them all and see the relationship among\nthe alternatives . \n \n\nThen because of the ambiguous comparison of values , social cost\nand social benefit , so  all of these should convert to dollar\nterm for convenient calculation . \n \n\nThe last one should be criterion .\n\n\nThere are a number of criteria that can help to achieve the goal ,\nsuch as political .\n\n\nThis factor we had also take into consideration . \n \n\nThough there are clear steps to follow to make a cost-benefit\nanalysis .\n\n\nSome problems are involved in it .\n\n\nThe first one is the measurement problem , that is how and what to\nmeasure . \n \n\na ) Relevance: as tax easily distort our calculation , we\nshould carefully calculate the profit . \n \n\nNet profit should be counted less tax .\n\n\nSocial profit should be counted before tax .\n\n\nb ) Shadow price: that is the opportunity cost .\n\n\nAs monopoly , regulation distort the market price , in evaluating the\ncost we should bear in mind the shadow price . \n \n\nIn addition , don't double count the benefit because very often ,\nit is not a benefit , but a transfer of purchasing power , for example , a\nnew airport is build .\n\n\nThe citizen is more convenient , and the buyer has increase .\n\n\nThen we should only count the benefit for the former one . \n\n \n\nc ) Spill-over effect: That is the externality .\n\n\nBut externality will not reflect in market price , so it is difficult\nto calculate , eg : pollution . \n \n\nd ) Constraint: some political and administrative\nconstraint resist the planning , that the economists cannot work the most\nefficiency project .\n\n\nFor example , the politician may   prefer \ntaxation than widen the road even the latter one is more economic . \n \n\nThe second problem is the  invention  criteria .\n\n\nBecause there is a &lsquo; time file &rsquo; along the project , we\nhad to calculate the future benefit and layouts into present value .\n\n\nThe method we used are a ) discount present rate ( DPV\n) , that is to  discount the future benefit into\npresent benefit . \n \n\nb )  Internate  rate of return ( IRR\n) .\n\n\nCalculate the return rate of the project after certain years .\n\n\nBut  the more popular method is Discount\nPresent Rate because it is logically than IRR , and it has a single choice\nwhere as the IRR has more preference .\n\n\nAlso IRR prioritize the choices contradict to DPV . \n \n\n Moreover the investment\nrate also fluctuated due to political factors and difficult to choose an\nappropriate interest rate or discount rate . \n \n\nThe last problem is the uncertainty , since a project last for\nmany years , it will  encounter  the uncertainty such as political\nfactors , economic inflation , the instability of rate .\n\n\n   Nevertheless , the government  ' s\ninvolvement also distort the market , such as it change its policy , allow\nother products exists , taxation affect the net profit that will compete with\nsocial welfare programmes .  \n\n\n3 \n \n\nBefore explain Coase Theorem , I would first explain the terms\n\" externality \" and \" non-excludability \" .\n\n\nExternality is that the production or consumption of \ngood or services that the business or consumer hadn't pay it &ampersand; when\nthere is spill over effects it won't reflect in market price .\n\n\nThe most common externality we encounter is the negative externality\nand positive externality .\n\n\nNegative externality means that a cost impose on a person that the\naction done by others without the consent of the person .\n\n\nWhile positive externality is the one gain a benefit from the action\ndone by others without paying for it . \n \n\nNon-excludability is that everyone has the  right to\nparticipate in the action .\n\n\nIn general the cost for non-excludable goods are high .\n\n\nIf the good are non-excludable , they are usually two  bids  .\n\n\nOne  is the pure public\ngoods that usually  provide directly thro ' the\ngovernment or private sector contracted by the government .\n\n\nAnd it is distributed via public budget eg. the defense .\n\n\nAnother type of non-excludable goods is a mixed good with the\ncombined nature of rival for example , the swimming pool , parks .\n\n\nThey are finance out of charges and the non-excludability is subject\nto crowding .\n\n\nThis kind of good can be provided by private and public sectors .\n\n \n\nThe common negative externality we encounter is pollution .\n\n\nAs in Tsuen Wan , it is a polluted area , but it is not owing to one\nfactory , but many many factories .\n\n\nThe producer hadn't calculate the social cost they put and take\nadvantages from using clean air .\n\n\nAs pollution isn't a new problem , the government cannot combat it\nbut to abate it .\n\n\nAs the property rights is poorly defined  we\ncan't define who own the air .\n\n\nAnd the transaction cost is high because the factories are difficult\nto compensate every residents in Tsuen Wan .\n\n\nSo , the government can intervene in the situation .\n\n\nThe government can use regulation to abate pollution to reduce the\ntransaction cost .\n\n\nBecause pollution is a problem of externality and air is\nnon-excludability , everyone can use it .\n\n\nFrom Coase Theorem if the one involved in the transaction are\nwilling to trade , the one  will get it who value it at the\nmost valuation as the government enact regulation and taxation to the firms .\n\n\nThey can choose continue their their industry or shut it down .\n\n\nAnother example is the lamp that install the ladder .\n\n\nThe one who install the lamp pay the cost .\n\n\nTheir neighbour can also enjoy the  benefit without paying it .\n\n\nIn this case , because the transactional cost is low , they can\ninternalize the externalities .\n\n\nThe lamp owner can get   compromise  with\nhis neighbour to eliminate free rider , but it costs a higher transaction\ncost .\n\n\nIf he install the lamp by himself , he own the property right of the\nlamp .  \n\n\n1 \n \n\nThe case that Bought Place Scheme  VS Direct\nSubsidy Scheme for private school .\n\n\nThe latter one has a more efficiency and utility gain from the DSS .\n\n\nAs before , government bought Place for Private School .\n\n\nit seemed that they have less freedom to run the school , because\nthe students are distributed through computer system .\n\n\nThe school would receive the students .\n\n\nAs the government paid them a lump sum to buy place , they need not\nto worry about the finance because it comes from the government . \n \n\nAs it change to Direct Subsidy Scheme , the school is chosen by\nstudents or parents .\n\n\nThey can choose the school that they think runs efficiency and reach\nthe aided school standard\n\n\nif the school is understandard , the parents will not consider it\nbecause DSS the government will subsidy the private school  owing to students that they can collect .\n\n\nAnd the subsidize will deduct the school  ' s fee income so that the\nschool can't  be profiteering . \n \n\nAs the school is chosen by students or parents fewer students\nmeans less income and subsidy .\n\n\nThen they would tried to run efficiency , such as improve the\nstandard of teaching , enlarge more facilities to help teaching , provide\nattractive activities .\n\n\nOtherwise they will shut down .\n\n\nMoreover , the private school is enhance to compete , they will have\nvarious methods to improve , thus the schools will become variety .\n\n\nIt provides more opportunities for school .\n\n\nAnd the school has more freedom to run\n\n\nit gives them a greater utility . \n \n\nb ) Public transport subsidy paid to the transport\ncompanies reinforce the student to take more transportation even they are not\nin need .\n\n\nAnd it limited the uses of students about the subsidy because the\nsubsidy is directly to transport companies .\n\n\nIt means that their income effect has  no change .\n\n\nIf they have cash subsidy , that means they have increase their\nincome effect . \n \n\nAs the student increase the income effect , the consumption line\nwill shift upwards .\n\n\nit means that they have a greater utility than before .\n\n\nAs shown by the figure , after students receives \n subsidies  , they can sometimes give up transports means but instead\nof walking or by other luxury goods such as taxi . \n \n\nMoreover , to use the money more \nefficiently  , the student will choose the most appropriate means to the\ndestination . \n \n\nSo , subsidy cash to student is similar to Direct subsidy scheme\nfor Private schools , is more   efficient  and\nutility gains of the recipients .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "8ff609b9-723e-4fe3-bb91-7e08980d206c", "added":

Left , they talk through their marital troubles with social\nworker Kevin Kwan .  Photos: Dickson Lee \n\n\n'In the past , women tended to think that after they got married they\nshould be loyal to their husbands whatever happened , but this attitude has\nchanged, ' says Lam Wai-ha , external organiser of the Association for the\nAdvancement of Feminism . \n\n\n\n Social workers agree that any relationship lacking a good foundation will\ncome under pressure and is likely to suffer ongoing conflict .\n\n\n'When a marriage is not good , couples argue a lot .\n\n\nThe woman feels frustrated and can easily be tempted to fall into the\narms of another man who appears to care for her more than her husband, ' says\nCheung Pui-ling , a social worker with the Hong Kong Family Welfare Society ,\nwhich has also noted an increase in married women having affairs in recent\nyears . \n\n\n\n Such behaviour is far from the traditional image of honourable Chinese\nwomen .\n\n\nHistory depicts married women who had affairs as evil .\n\n\nIn ancient times , in some villages an unfaithful wife and her lover\nwould be locked in a bamboo pig cage and drowned in a river . \n\n\n\n But societies which once turned a blind eye to - or even encouraged - men  ' s\ninfidelity , while demonising women who do the same thing , are having their\nmoral ground rules redefined .\n\n\nAs in the West , female adultery is becoming more common . \n\n\n\n Rights workers suggest that society shouldn't see the trend of women  ' s\nextra-marital affairs as  ' bad ' .\n\n\n'We are not encouraging married women to have affairs , but they\nshould be given the choice .\n\n\nIt is better than being trapped in an unhappy marriage; that can have\ntragic consequences .\n\n\nA woman should be able to decide her own fate, ' Lam says . \n\n\n\n In Chinese communities , men whose wives have affairs are dubbed as  ' wearing\na green hat ' and they feel an extreme loss of face .\n\n\nIn the Yuan dynasty ( 1206 to 1368 ) , criminals and\nprostitutes were ordered to wear green headscarves as a sign of shame .\n\n\nMen whose wives were adulterous were called  ' green cloths ' and\nprostitutes ' parents and male relatives also had to wear green clothes . \n\n\n\n But Dr Virginia Yip Choy-yin , associate professor of linguistics ,\ndepartment of modern languages and intercultural studies at Hong Kong  ' s\nChinese University , says the term , especially designed for  ' wronged'\nhusbands , is  ' language sexism ' .\n\n\n'If a married woman has an affair , society finds it remarkable and\ncreates a phrase to describe ( the husband's ) suffering , but\nthere is no reverse of it .\n\n\nThey don't make a phrase for wives whose husbands have affairs - the\nwomen are not seen as victimised - because society thinks men having affairs\nis acceptable, ' Yip says . \n\n\n\n Social workers say the cases they receive may only be the tip of the\niceberg as many men , unlike women , refuse to seek help because of the\nstigma .\n\n\nThey are rarely able to talk to friends or family about the pain of\ntheir personal situations .\n\n\nIt can lead to violence and sometimes death .\n\n\nKwok says:  ' Men have nowhere to release their anger , and as it\nbuilds up , they can become very dangerous .\n\n\nThey can hurt themselves or others. ' \n\n\n\n Social workers fear that if female affairs become as prevalent as male\ncases , it will have a  ' serious impact on society ' , ripping families apart\nand leading to more neglected children .\n\n\nThe cuckold husbands , as you would expect , come from all walks of\nlife .\n\n\nMostly in their 30s and 40s , they share similar emotions: anger and\nshock , shame and helplessness .\n\n\n'They don't know how to talk to their wives , and many call us and\ncry, ' Kwok says .\n\n\n'They tend to think their wives go to find other men because they are\nuseless , because they can't satisfy them .\n\n\nThey blame themselves for not earning enough money , they feel that\nthey have failed.

approach in championing\neducation reform when he was chairman of the Education Commission and fear a\nsimilar approach would turn the civil service on its head .\n\n\nFor his part , Mr Leung has made no secret of his intention to push\nfor structural and cultural changes to the civil service under the \" three Rs\n&rdquo; - reprioritising , reorganising and re-engineering . \n\n\n\n In the 2003-04 Budget , he highlighted the principle of \" big\nmarket , small government &rdquo; as one of the cornerstones of Hong Kong  ' s\ndevelopment .\n\n\n\" The resources we are using come from the public .\n\n\nWe must use them cost-effectively , &rdquo; he said . \n\n\n\n Undoubtedly , growing pressure from society for Mr Leung to take more\nforceful measures to cut spending will put him in a more difficult and\nvulnerable position within the bureaucracy .\n\n\nBut it could also be a blessing in disguise if he can turn the\npressure into vigour for change . \n\n\n\n Balancing the budget by 2006-07 has emerged as one of the key tasks for\nMr Leung .\n\n\nIt will be no small achievement if he succeeds in turning the slogan\nof \" doing more with less &rdquo; into reality at the end of his five-year\nterm . \n\n\n\n  Chris Yeung is the Post  ' s Editor-at-Large chris.yeung@scmp.com", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "0abf7ee9-7b79-4074-80dc-7a9fd279c930", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.825746+00:00"}

to be appointed as advisers , the alliance , led by Mr Lo Tak-shing ,\nwill have seven members directly advising China on Hongkong affairs . \n\n \n\nThe second largest group of politicians would come from DAB\n&semi;\n\n\nMs Leung aside , Mr Tsang Yok-sing , Mr Tam Yiu-chung and Ms Chan\nYuen-han are also joining the second batch . \n\n \n\nThe Co-operative Resources Centre also fared well with Mr Allen\nLee Peng-fei , Mr Steven Poon Kwok-lim , Mr Stephen Cheong Kam-chuen and Mr\nNgai Shiu-kit joining the incumbent adviser Mr Lau Wong-fat . \n\n \n\nLiberal Democratic Federation  ' s representation will be increased\nfrom three to four , with vice chairman Mr Philip Kwok Chi-kuen becoming the\nlatest appointee . \n\n \n\nThe president of the Federation of Trade Unions Mr Lee Chak-tim\nhas also been appointed .  \n\n \n\n\n Hopes for early solution as airport talks resume  \n\n\n\n By DOREEN CHEUNG  \n\n \n\nTALKS between Britain and China on the airport financing package\nresumed yesterday after a seven-month suspension . \n\n \n\nSpeaking after yesterday  ' s Joint Liaison Group ( JLG\n) Airport Committee meeting , British team leader Tony Galsworthy said\nthe atmosphere of the meeting was good and he hoped they would be able to\nhave a resolution soon . \n\n \n\n\" We had a lengthy discussion this morning , following the\nMemorandum .\n\n\nAnd we will need to have further meetings , which I hope will take\nplace before very long in order to take the matter further , &rdquo; he said .\n\n\n \n\nIn Tokyo , Financial Secretary Hamish Macleod welcomed the\nresumption of talks . \n\n \n\n\" At the moment it looks as if economics and politics are\nbeing treated separately .\n\n\nI hope we can keep the two separate , &rdquo; he said , although he\ncautioned against expecting any immediate agreement on financing . \n\n \n\nMr Galsworthy said the Western Harbour Tunnel project was\ndiscussed and said he hoped the tunnel franchise could be resolved in the\nnext few meetings . \n\n \n\nHe also said the British side had told their Chinese counterparts\nthat the Central and Wan Chai reclamation project needed to be set in motion\nvery soon and various proposals had been put forward . \n\n \n\n\" It is misleading to talk of a first , second or a third\nproposal ... there is an infinite spectrum of possibilities , &rdquo; he said .\n\n\n \n\nHe said it was impossible to talk about any one deadline for\nagreement as the airport projects involved a large number of different\ncontracts and time scales . \n\n \n\nThe British side was waiting for the Chinese side to respond in\ndetail to various suggestions they had made . \n\n \n\n\" The ball is rather in their court at the moment , &rdquo;\nhe said .  \n\n \n\n\n Beijing accepts further funding for airport body  \n\n\n\n By DOREEN CHEUNG  \n\n \n\nCHINA yesterday raised no objection to further funding for the\nProvisional Airport Authority ( PAA ) , although there is still\nno agreement with Britain on the financial package for the Chek Lap Kok\nairport and rail link . \n\n \n\nSpeaking after a three-hour meeting of the Joint Liaison Group  ' s\nAirport Committee , British team leader Tony Galsworthy said no objection was\nraised to more funds being channelled to the PAA . \n\n \n\nShortly after the meeting , the Government informed Legislative\nCouncillors that it would be seeking approval for another &dollar;564 million .\n\n\n \n\nIt is understood that the Government slashed the request from\n&dollar;1 billion because of likely opposition from legislators . \n\n \n\nThe final figure -; in the region that legislators had\nindicated was acceptable -; provides &dollar;374 million for short-term\nhead office expenses and &dollar;190 million for eight critical airport\ndesign packages . \n\n \n\nThe request will go to the Legislative Council  ' s committee on\nairport finance and the Airport Consultative Committee by next Thursday .\n\n\n \n\nIn justifying the head office cost up to next March , the draft\npaper said any funding for a lesser period would fail to sustain staff morale\n, weaken the authority  ' s commercial position , and have auditors qualify its\naccounts . \n\n \n\nFunding for the eight design contracts has become critical to\nmaintain momentum and provide vital input for site preparation work . \n\n \n\nThese design packages will need to be started before July . \n\n \n\nAny delay in funding for the head office and the design contracts\ncould result in serious delays in the completion of the airport platform and\nclaims from the site preparation contractors . \n\n \n\nIn detailing the expenditure of the PAA , the paper noted that a\nsaving of &dollar;151 million had been achieved in the award of five design\npackages -; temporary utilities , permanent utilities , waste water and\nstorm water drains and sewerage , airfield tunnels , and irrigation systems\n-; which were awarded last May . \n\n \n\nOut of the original &dollar;236 million approved , only\n&dollar;85 million was required . \n\n \n\nThe &dollar;151 million saving on the packages was still\navailable to meet the authority  ' s requirements for other critical design\nwork . \n\n \n\nOf the total commitment of &dollar;743 million approved to meet\nthe authority  ' s head office expenses up to June , &dollar;125 million could\nbe saved mainly by the reduced expenditure on staff recruitment and the\nemployment of consultancies on the PAA  ' s longer term strategic and planning\nissues . \n\n \n\nThis saving could be applied to head office expenses after June .\n\n\n \n\nThe PAA required a total of &dollar;840 million the paper said .\n\n\n \n\nIt revealed that the Government hoped that Britain and China\nwould reach an agreement on the financing of the new airport by June 30 .\n \n\n \n\n\n Call for PAA to act more openly   \n\n\n By DOREEN CHEUNG  \n\n \n\nLEGISLATOR Samuel Wong Ping-wai is to pressure the Provisional\nAirport Authority ( PAA ) to become more open about its affairs\nfollowing concern over mismanagement . \n\n \n\nInstead of a fully-appointed board of directors for the future\nAirport Authority , Mr Wong suggested some seats should be designated to\nlegislators and municipal councillors to enhance the authority  ' s\naccountability. \n\n \n\nHe also raised the concern that the senior posts in the PAA were\nheld mainly by expatriates . \n\n \n\nMr Wong , the late Stephen Cheong Kam-chuen  ' s replacement in the\nLegislative Council  ' s  ad hoc  group on airport finance , said he\nwould pressure the PAA to reveal more on its internal management . \n\n \n\nNoting that many questions directed to the PAA had been left\nunanswered , Mr Wong said legislators would draft and file a list of\nquestions to the PAA . \n\n \n\n\" I would force the PAA officials to seriously respond to\nour inquiries by holding regular meetings .\n\n\nWe can't drill them only when they seek money from the Legislative\nCouncil , &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\nMr Wong said he would like to know whether the PAA had pledged to\ncultivate local people to take up senior positions . \n\n \n\nMeanwhile , Chinese authorities have urged the Hongkong\nGovernment to send a copy of the upcoming Airport Authority Bill as soon as\npossible , according to Mr Hung Wing-tat of the Conservation Association .\n\n\n \n\nA government source said the draft bill should be ready by early\nnext month . \n\n \n\nThe draft bill would go to the Executive Council for endorsement\nand then to the Chinese side for consultation , he said . \n\n \n\nHe attributed the slow progress to technical reasons rather than\nthe Sino-British row over the airport issue .  \n\n \n\n\n Electoral bill talks defended at forum   \n\n\n By DOREEN CHEUNG  \n\n \n\nLEGISLATORS yesterday justified their move to discuss the\nelectoral bill before China and Britain had reached agreement by saying it\nwould guarantee the bill  ' s smooth passage in the legislature . \n\n \n\nSpeaking at a City Forum , Andrew Wong Wang-fat said discussing\nthe bill in the Legislative Council  ' s constitutional development panel would\navoid a repeat of the Court of Final Appeal incident . \n\n \n\nThere would be a big storm if the legislature decided to reject\nthe Sino-British agreement on the electoral arrangements , he said . \"\nWhy don't we discuss the bill now ? &rdquo; he asked . \n\n \n\nThe introduction of the Court of Final Appeal has been brought to\na halt after legislators refused to accept an agreement on the court  ' s\ncomposition reached by China and Britain . \n\n \n\nLegislator Frederick Fung Kin-kee said it was better to air their\nviews before an agreement had been reached . \n\n \n\nLegislator Henry Tang Ying-yen from the Liberal Party said\nHongkong people had been kept in the dark over the past four rounds of\nSino-British talks . \n\n \n\nHe said people should express their views through whatever means\npossible . \n\n \n\nBut Dr Lo Chi-keung from the Democratic Alliance for the\nBetterment of Hongkong insisted it was not the right time to discuss the bill .\n\n\n \n\nMeanwhile , a signed commentary from the Hongkong China News\nAgency warned that some legislators , with the support of the Hongkong\nGovernment , might be trying to table the electoral bill in Legco through a\npiece-meal approach . \n\n \n\nThis had been reflected by the passage of the boundary and\nelection commission bill and the constitutional development panel  ' s decision\nto discuss the electoral bill , it said .  \n\n \n\n\n Doubts over grants body student plan   \n\n\n By DOREEN CHEUNG  \n\n \n\nTHE University and Polytechnic Grants Committee ( UPGC\n) plans to triple the number of postgraduates in local institutions by\n1994 , according to the committee  ' s yet to be released report for the\n1988-91 triennium . \n\n \n\nHowever , the head of one university has expressed doubts about\nwhether the amount of research funding will be sufficient to attract high\ncaliber staff . \n\n \n\nThe UPG plans to increase the number of postgraduate research\nstudents in the territory  ' s seven tertiary institutions from the existing\n860 to 2218 in 1993-94 , according to the report . \n\n \n\nThis figure is equivalent to 41/2 per cent of the total\npopulation of 48,800 in the six tertiary education institutions , apart from\nLingnan College , funded by the UPGC . \n\n \n\nThe proportion of postgraduate students has been increasing since\n1988-89 from 1.8 per cent to 2.1 per cent in 1990-91 . \n\n \n\nAfter consultation with the six tertiary education institutions ,\nthe UPGC projected that the number of postgraduate students would top 1,285\nin 1991-92 , 1,713 in 1992-93 and 2,218 in 1993-94 . \n\n \n\nCompared with the total number of students , the percentage of\npostgraduate students will be increased gradually from three per cent in\n1991-92 , to 3.8 per cent in 1992-93 and 41/2 per cent in 1993-94 . \n\n \n\nHowever , the vice-chancellor of Hongkong University , Professor\nWang Gungwu , has said insufficient research funds might have an adverse\neffect in retraining high calibre staff . \n\n \n\nThis is despite the fact that the Legislative Council has\napproved &dollar;510 million for research projects up to 1995 , including a\ndoubling of the fund to &dollar;100 million for the 1991-92 academic year .\n\n\n \n\nWhile &dollar;122 million has been allocated for 1992-93 ,\n&dollar;144 million has been ear-marked for both 1993-94 and 1994-95 . \n\n \n\nBut the institutions ha e been urged to spend about two per cent\nof their recurrent lump sum grants to provide the necessary research\ninfrastructure . \n\n \n\nThe UPGC has said the increase reflected the Government  ' s\nacceptance of the need in this area as a means of attracting and retraining\nhigh calibre staff . \n\n \n\nDr Wang , however , said the funds fell short of demand . \n\n \n\n\" My colleagues are full of initiatives to do research .\n\n\nBut they are often stopped from carrying it out because of money\nshortages , &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\nThe worst-hit research areas had been those in the scientific\nfield , which required a lot of financial support , he said . \n\n \n\nAware of the small research funding allocation , the Government\nhas encouraged the institutions to seek private funding for research from the\nCroucher Foundation and the Royal Hongkong Jockey Club . \n\n \n\nBut Dr Wang said little money had been granted by the two\norganisations . \n\n \n\nThe university would try to seek funding on its own to finance\nresearch projects as well as to keep its academic staff , he said . \n\n \n\nHowever , the university and the Chinese University will be\ntraining a lesser share of postgraduate research student population as the\nnumbers increase . \n\n \n\nThe Hongkong University of Science and Technology will take an\nincreasingly important role in the area by expanding its number of\npostgraduate students from 74 in 1991-92 to 276 in 1993-94 .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "5276ff32-cb26-4ef6-a916-4c8cca4858ea", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.827235+00:00"}

I don't want to write a book\nabout my experience (  in detention on the mainland ) .\n\n\nI am an academic , and any books will be about my research into China  ' s\neconomic reform and development . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nAlthough Dr Li might genuinely want to return to a normal and\nquiet life in Hong Kong , the harsh reality is that his fate has become\nenmeshed in the complicated concept of \" one country , two systems\" . \n\n \n\nPro-democracy politicians , academics and human-rights activists\nhave warned that denying Dr Li entry into Hong Kong would deal a blow to the\nSAR  ' s autonomy on immigration issues . \n\n \n\nGovernment officials have so far kept silent , saying they do not\ncomment on individual cases .\n\n\nOfficials at City University , Dr Li  ' s employer , have said the\nuniversity wants to seek government advice on the matter . \n\n \n\nBeijing has yet to comment officially on whether Dr Li should be\nallowed to return to the SAR . \n\n \n\nSigns abound that opposition to granting him entry is strong .\n\n\nThe pro-Beijing newspaper  Ta Kung Pao  ran a commentary\nlast Friday headlined: \" Of course Li Shaomin can't come to Hong Kong\" .\n\n\n \n\nThe paper declared: \" Hong Kong absolutely will not allow\npeople who have been convicted of spying and deported for that reason to\nreturn here to continue their activities .\n\n\nIf it did , the SAR would become a base for spying activities that\ndamage the national interest . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nIn another commentary last Wednesday , the paper countered the\n\" one country , two systems &rdquo; argument: \" On matters\nrelating to national territory , sovereignty and state security , there is\nonly ` one country ' .\n\n\nSome people in Hong Kong always talk about ` two systems ' and not\nabout ` one country ' .\n\n\nThey say ` one country , two systems ' should apply even to spies .\n\n\nThis is ridiculous and laughable . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nPessimists have good reason to talk down Dr Li  ' s chances of\nreturning to Hong Kong in light of the mainland regime  ' s obsession with\nnational security and its concerns about the SAR  ' s vulnerability as a base\nfor spying activities . \n\n \n\nBut the secrecy surrounding Dr Li  ' s case - little is known about\nthe charges against him or the expulsion order applied to him - gives the SAR\nauthorities some room to manoeuvre . \n\n \n\nBeijing has so far turned a blind eye to some \"\ndisagreeable &rdquo; activities in the SAR .\n\n\nFor example , prominent activist Frank Lu Siching runs his\nInformation Centre for Human Rights and Democracy - which disseminates\ninformation about , among other things , dissidents ' activities on the\nmainland - out of Hong Kong . \n\n \n\nIndependent mainland unionist Han Dongfang , who was jailed for\n22 months for his role in the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests , was allowed to\nstay in Hong Kong after he was refused re-entry to the mainland in 1993 .\n\n\nHe became a permanent SAR resident last year . \n\n \n\nLeaders of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic\nDemocratic Movements of China have been branded subversive by Beijing , but\nthey remain active in local politics .\n\n\nEven though most alliance leaders are denied entry to the mainland ,\none of them , Lau Chin-shek , has been given special permission during the\npast year to visit his ailing mother in Guangzhou . \n\n \n\nAs Mr Lu of the Information Centre rightly points out: \"\nThere are already many thorns in China  ' s side who live in Hong Kong .\n\n\nAdding one more , Li Shaomin , makes little difference . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nIn fact , Dr Li  ' s presence in Hong Kong could prove a political\nwindfall , for both the SAR and the mainland .\n\n\nHe could be seen as living proof that \" one country , two\nsystems &rdquo; works .\n\n\nAs such , he could join the other icons in Hong Kong symbolising\n\" one country , two systems\" .\n\n\nThese include the annual June 4 candlelight vigil , the articles\nwritten by dissidents Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng for local newspapers , and\nthe ongoing protests organised by Falun Gong practitioners in the SAR . \n\n \n\nDespite all the tirades launched by hardliners , these symbols\nare welcomed by many around the world as signs of Hong Kong  ' s unique\ncharacter under the new constitutional order .\n\n\nThey are among the assets that Hong Kong should protect and enhance ,\n\" lest we become just another city in China\" , to borrow a phrase Chief\nSecretary for Administration Donald Tsang Yam-kuen used last week . \n\n \n\nThe way the Government has so far handled the\nbanned-on-the-mainland Falun Gong spiritual movement -\nby ruling out the introduction of\nanti-cult legislation , at least for the time being - shows a higher degree\nof sensitivity towards growing fears , justified or not , that Hong Kong  ' s\nautonomy is gradually eroding . \n\n \n\nThe Court of Final Appeal  ' s recent right-of-abode rulings show a\nsimilar sensitivity . \n\n \n\nPerhaps Dr Li  ' s case , which involves important matters of\nprinciple and requires sophisticated political understanding , will join this\npantheon of \" one country , two systems &rdquo; success stories . \n\n \n\n Chris Yeung (  cyeung@scmp.com ) is the Pst  ' s Political\nEditor  \n\n\n\n \n\n\nLi Shaomin  ' s re-entry has resurrected confidence in the SAR  ' s\nautonomy - but it may be at some political cost to the Chief Executive ,\nwrites  Chris Yeung    \n\n\n Between two devils  \n\n \n\n BY ALLOWING  spy-case scholar Li Shaomin back into\nHong Kong , the administration of Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa scored an\nimportant victory in terms of Hong Kong  ' s autonomy .\n\n\nBut it was not without political cost . \n\n \n\nPro-Beijing figure Ma Lik , a local deputy of the National People\n's Congress , may be a lone critic .\n\n\nBut he did raise a valid and sensitive point regarding the\nfundamentals of the \" one country , two systems &rdquo; concept .\n\n\nMr Ma asked whether the Government  ' s decision amounted , in effect ,\nto a declaration of independence for the SAR . \n\n \n\nGiven that Dr Li , 45 , was ordered to leave the country after\nbeing convicted of espionage on the mainland and that Hong Kong is part of\nChina , it is hard to argue in favour of the academic  ' s return merely on the\ngrounds that the SAR has a different legal system . \n\n \n\nAlthough it is true there is no legal basis for the verdict of\nthe Beijing court to be applied in Hong Kong , the SAR Government cannot\ndismiss as irrelevant the political reality that the conviction was delivered\nafter a judicial process on the mainland . \n\n \n\nGiving approval for Dr Li to return to Hong Kong can , as some\ncommentators have been quick to point out , be described as a slap in the\nface for Beijing . \n\n \n\nAsked about Mr Ma  ' s comments , a government official said:\n\" You can't argue against him .\n\n\nThe simple question is: isn't Hong Kong part of China ?\n\n\nBut on issues concerning ` one country , two systems ' it is better\nnot to make things explicitly clear . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nIt may be the strategy of the SAR Government to stick to\nambiguity when it comes to the question of who is winning the struggle at the\nheart of Hong Kong  ' s constitutional arrangements - \" one country\n&rdquo; or \" two systems\" . \n\n \n\nThe irony , though , is that supporters of the government\ndecision to allow Dr Li back , including many people who are normally\nregarded as critics of Mr Tung , have praised the Chief Executive .\n\n\nTo them , Mr Tung has made the right decision in the interests of\nHong Kong , one which is right in terms of how the \" one country , two\nsystems &rdquo; concept should work . \n\n \n\nSome officials are , in private , pleasantly surprised at the\nmove .\n\n\nIt came at a time when Hong Kong  ' s autonomy had already been boosted\nby other decisions . \n\n \n\nOne official said: \" It  ' s the third autonomy story .\n\n\nFirst , you have the Falun Gong with no action being taken .\n\n\nSecond , there is the Court of Final Appeal decision on right of\nabode , that reasserts judicial independence .\n\n\nAll are upbeat stories for Hong Kong underlining its high degree of\nautonomy . . .\n\n\nIt shows clearly we can take decisions definitely in the interest of\nHong Kong . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nBut publicly , SAR leaders have chosen their words carefully and\npreferred to play down the implications of the case as far as the experiment\nof \" one country , two systems &rdquo; is concerned .\n\n\nBeijing , meanwhile , has kept silent , as if the mainland court  ' s\norder didn't exist . \n\n \n\nRepeatedly asked by reporters to explain the decision , Mr Tung\nhas stuck to the line that it was made in the interests of Hong Kong and the\ncountry as whole .\n\n\n\" We have to consider (  the principle of ) ` one country ' on one\nhand , and on the other hand (  the principle of ) ` two systems ' when making a\ndecision , &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\nMr Tung pointed out that immigration affairs were within the\nautonomy of Hong Kong , but stopped short of saying Dr Li  ' s case was purely\nsuch a matter . \n\n \n\nThe cautious and subdued manner of the Hong Kong and central\ngovernments in not seeking to claim political gains from Dr Li  ' s return in\nthe context of the \" one country , two systems &rdquo; concept reflects\nthe inherent dilemma of the case . \n\n \n\nIt highlights the difficulty in making the right balance between\nthe interests of the SAR and Beijing .\n\n\nPlacing too much emphasis on the importance of \" two systems\n&rdquo; in Dr Li  ' s case - as many commentators have done - runs the risk of\ncreating new frictions in mainland-SAR relations .\n\n\nIt will also be seen as openly ridiculing the mainland  ' s judicial\nsystem . \n\n \n\nBy keeping remarks on the case to the minimum , SAR and Beijing\nleaders hope to avoid making it a precedent in terms of how the two systems\nplay out under one country in future . \n\n \n\nIn a column published in the Chinese-language  Ming Pao \non Thursday , Tsang Yok-sing , chairman of the pro-Beijing Democratic\nAlliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong , wrote: \" (  The ) Li case . . .\ndoes not set a precedent .\n\n\nThe central and SAR governments have already shown flexibility in\npolicies concerning the entry of ` sensitive persons ' . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThis is because the Dr Li case could become a dangerous precedent\n, from the perspective of Beijing , blurring the parameters of \" one\ncountry &rdquo; and paving the way for future challenges to the principle .\n\n\n \n\nIn a joint article published in Thursday's  Apple Daily \n, two mainland legal scholars at the City University challenged the legal\nbasis for allowing Dr Li to return to the SAR .\n\n\nCiting the Basic Law , which states Hong Kong is an inseparable part\nof China , Zhu Guobin and Gu Minkang wrote: \" If Hong Kong can be\nexcluded as outside the country , is not Hong Kong becoming another sovereign ?\nIs not ` one country , two systems ' becoming ` two countries , two systems?'\n\n\n \n\n\" What is ` one country , two systems ' all about ?\n\n\nWhat is rule of law ?\n\n\nWe are confused , &rdquo; they wrote . \n\n \n\nIf the mainland scholars and many analysts were perplexed , it is\nbecause of the long-held view that Hong Kong  ' s room for flexibility on\nmatters relating to sovereignty and national security has been extremely\nlimited . \n\n \n\nIt is also unlikely that the Government would have decided on its\nown whether to allow Dr Li to re-enter Hong Kong , by regarding the decision\nas an \" internal matter &rdquo; relating to immigration procedures .\n\n\n \n\nIt is doubtful whether it would have acted without prior\nconsultation with the central Government . \n\n \n\nRemarks by Director of Immigration Ambrose Lee Siu-kwong that he\ndid not consult Beijing on the decision shed little light on the complexities\nsurrounding the issue . \n\n \n\nWorse still , it gives an impression - most probably false - that\nHong Kong can make its own decisions on cases like Dr Li  ' s re-entry . \n\n \n\nRightly or wrongly , the government decision will be interpreted\nfrom sharply different perspectives .\n\n\nSome will see it as a sign of a greater awareness among Hong Kong  ' s\nleaders of the importance of sticking to the SAR  ' s system when it comes to\nmatters such as the case of Dr Li .\n\n\nThis may be wishful thinking . \n\n\nOthers may cite it as a further proof that Mr Tung , if not the\ncommunist leadership in Beijing , is prepared to compromise on the principle\nof \" one country &rdquo; at times , when it is expedient . \n\n \n\nThe depth of silence in Beijing and the low-key approach of the\nGovernment in handling the return of Dr Li indicates a desire to treat him as\na unique case with the hope it will be seen by the public as such .\n\n\nA heated public debate on the implications for \" one country ,\ntwo systems\" , is the last thing they want . \n\n \n\nThe same dilemma was faced by the Government in its attempt to\nreconcile the differences between the interests of Hong Kong and those of\nBeijing in two other recent controversies .\n\n\nThese are the latest right-of-abode ruling and the approach to Falun\nGong followers . \n\n \n\nIn the right-of-abode ruling , delivered by the Court of Final\nAppeal last month , judges rejected government arguments and came to an\ninterpretation of the Basic Law which appeared to differ from remarks by the\nNational People  ' s Congress Standing Committee . \n\n \n\nThe Government , while no doubt disappointed at the result , had\nto emphasise the independence of the Judiciary .\n\n\nBut it also needed to make it clear to Beijing that the SAR had\nalready represented the central Government  ' s interests by asking the court\nto consult the Standing Committee prior to giving its ruling (  even though\nthe court decided not to do so ) .\n\n\nOn the Falun Gong , SAR leaders toed Beijing  ' s line in branding it\nan evil cult .\n\n\nBut the need for a new law to ban the group in Hong Kong was ruled\nout - at least for the time being . \n\n \n\nThe strategy worked in the sense that potential political crises\nwere averted .\n\n\nThe seemingly conflicting messages , however , have made it\ndifficult for the Government to score clear political points from these\nissues , even though the outcome is most people want to see . \n\n \n\n Chris Yeung (  cyeung@scmp.com ) is the Post Political Editor", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "bf0ff4e1-62bd-4e12-8747-11517ceef80d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.828762+00:00"}
{"text": "Introduction    \n\n\n Before looking into the contents of the two constitutions , it is\nnecessary to define the term \" constitution &rdquo; in order to have a\nclear concept .\n\n\nIn Finer  ' s word  , it is  \"\nCodes of rules which govern the allocation of functions , powers and duties\namong various governmental agencies and their officers , and define the\nrelationships between them and the public . &rdquo; \n\n\nWhile according to Wheare  , it is \n\" a selection of legal rules which govern the government of that\ncountry and which have been embodied in a document . &rdquo; \n\n\nIn fact , any society or country can draw up its constitution-in order\nto establish certain guidelines in operating itself .\n\n\nHere the constitutions-of two \" states/colonies &rdquo; are\nconcerned .\n\n\nThe comparison between them will start with the classification of\ntypes of States in which they belong to . \n\n\n   I. Types of States   \n\n\n <bold   > i. Federal/Unitary   \n\n\n\n Australia and Hong Kong are two examples falling within these two\ncategories .\n\n\nIn a federal state power is distributed between central and regional\nauthorities , each locus of government enjoying exclusive competence or sole\npower in relation to defined matters within its territory .\n\n\n  \n\n\nAustralia is a federation .\n\n\nEvery Australian must obey two sets of laws .\n\n\nThere are two elected governments and two Constitutions .\n\n\nThese two sets of governments and Constitutions are  Commonwealth\n and  State  .\n\n\nUnder such classification Hong Kong is governed with a unitary system .\n\n\nIt is because in Hong Kong there is only one government authority\ncontrolling the entire territory , namely  the Hong Kong Government  .\n\n\n\n   ii. Presidential Executive/Parliamentary\nExecutive/Gubernatorial   \n\n\n\n When we say that a state  ' s chief executive is presidential , that means\nthe executive is not a member of the legislature .\n\n\nIf the chief executive is a member of and responsible to the\nlegislature , the system is classified as  parliamentary  .\n\n\nIn this sense Australia is said to be operated under this kind of\nsystem that places ultimate authority in the legislative assembly .\n\n\n On the other hand , Hong Kong is neither\npresidential nor parliamentary executive in nature .\n\n\nThe Government in Hong Kong is a  gubernatorial  one&semi;\nthe governor is both legislature and chief executive in the territory and\nthere are few limitations on his authority . \n\n\n   iii. Bicameral/Unicameral   \n\n\n\n In Hong Kong there is a unicameral legislative assembly which endowed as\npart of a legislature with limited legislative authority .\n\n\nWhile the federal Parliament in Australia is a bicameral law-making\nbody .\n\n\nThe two chambers&semi; the upper and the Lower Houses , are the\nSenate and the House of Representatives , and the third component of\nparliament is the Queen/Crown who acts through the Governor-General . \n\n\n   iv. Written/Unwritten   \n\n\n\n Constitution can be either a written or an unwritten one .\n\n\nA written constitution is enacted according to certain procedures\nthat gives it pre-eminence among the state  ' s laws .\n\n\nThere is a written constitution in both Australia and Hong Kong .\n\n\nThe Australian , Constitution is originated from an Act of the United\nKingdom parliament while the constitution in Hong Kong is comprised of the\nLetters patent and Royal Instructions . \n\n\n   v. Flexible/Rigid   \n\n\n\n When we say that a constitution is flexible , that means it can be\ninadvertently or impliedly amended .\n\n\n However , as the main function of a written\nconstitution is to provide a set of rules and principles which act as the\nguidelines of the operation of the government , thus most of the written\nconstitutions are more rigid and difficult to amend .\n\n\nIn Hong Kong , the Constitution cannot be amended by the Hong Kong\nlegislature and from this point of view it can be regarded as a rigid one .\n\n\nBut on the other hand , it can be easily amended or replaced by the\nauthority in the United Kingdom which made it or overridden by any Act of\nParliament , therefore from the British  ' s point of view the Hong Kong\nConstitution is flexible to be amended . \n\n\n\n In Australia , the Constitution is a permanent document and can be\namended only with great difficulty .\n\n\nAccording to Lane  , a proposed amendment to\nthe Constitution must first be passed by an absolute majority of each House\nof parliament , or at least of one House if the other House refuses .\n\n\nThen a majority of the \" state &rdquo; electors in a majority\nof States must approve the amendment .\n\n\nOn top of this , a majority of the \" national &rdquo; electors\nin all the States , and , since July 1971 , in the two internal territories\nmust approve the amendment .\n\n\nThus the Australian Constitution is strictly rigid to be amended .\n\n\nIn addition , one must notice that while the Commonwealth\nConstitution is difficult to be amended , the State Constitutions are rather\n\" flexible &rdquo; , which can be impliedly amended .\n\n\n \n\n\n   II Historical Background of the two Constitutions\n  \n\n\n\n After comparing the general characteristics of the two Constitutions , we\nnow come to their historical background : Hong Kong is a British colony\nbecause of the treaties signed by China and Britain in 1842 , 1860 and 1898 .\n\n\nThe next step of the British monarch was to issue an  Order in\nCouncil  that formally took possession of the territory .\n\n\nThe most basic constitutional documents in Hong Kong include the \nCharter  of April 1843 which constituted the island of Hong Kong as a\ncolony&semi; the   Order  in Council of 24 October 1860\nwhich annexed the peninsula of Kowloon to the original colony&semi; and the\nOrder in Council of 20 October 1898 which added the New Territories to it .\n\n\n\n\n The Order in Council do no more than define the territorial boundaries of\nthe colony and the extent of the jurisdiction of the Governor and the\nLegislative council .\n\n\n The basic framework of the administration\nof Hong Kong is established by the  Letters Patent  and together\nwith the  Royal Instructions  passed under the  Royal Sign\nManual and Signet  which laid down the procedures that must be followed .\n\n\nThe details of the two documents will be discussed later . \n\n\n\n The Australian Constitutional development started with Governor Phillip\ntaking possession of eastern Australia on behalf of His Majesty the King ,\nGeorge III .\n\n\nIt became a civil colony when an Imperial Act established a\nLegislative Council to advise the Governor .\n\n\nLater after several times of separation of territories on the land ,\nthere are finally six colonies in Australia .\n\n\nThese six Colonies became the six \" Original States &rdquo; in\nthe Commonwealth when it was established on 1 January 1901 .\n\n\n As the government institutions evolved the\nColonies grew towards independence .\n\n\nThe Legislative Councils in New South Wales , Victoria , South\nAustralia and Van Diemen  ' s Land in the mid 1850s and in western Australia in\nthe late 1880s drafted Constitutions .\n\n\nThese were sent off to the Colonial Office in England for approval .\n\n\nAs mentioned above , at Federation on 1 January 1901 the former\ncolonies became States , keeping their Constitutions , laws , powers , Houses\nof Parliament , courts and governments . \n\n\n\n Although the Federation was established in 1901 , it was not until 9 July\n1900 the  Commonwealth of Australia constitution Act 1900  was\nenacted .\n\n\n\n\n   Contents of the two Constitutions  \n\n\n\n   Hong Kong   \n\n\n   A. Letters Patent   \n\n\n\n The Letters Patent are the earlier and more important document .\n\n\nThey create the office of Governor and Commander-in-chief of Hong\nKong and require him to observe laws and instructions given to him by the\nQueen or the secretary of state .\n\n\nThey also deal with the constitution of the Executive and the\nLegislative councils , the Governor  ' s powers in respect of legislation ,\ndisposal of land , the appointment of judges and public officers , pardons ,\nand the tenure of office of Supreme Court and District Court judges .\n\n\n \n\n\n   B. Royal Instructions   \n\n\n\n The Royal Instructions deal  ' With the appointment of members of the\nExecutive and Legislative Councils , the nature of proceedings in the\nExecutive Council , the Governor  ' s responsibility to consult the Executive\ncouncil on important policy matters , and his right to act against its advice .\n\n\nThey also deal with the membership of and election to , the\nlegislative Council , the nature of proceedings there , and the nature of\nlegislation which may not be passed .\n\n\n \n\n\n\n From these two documents it can be seen that the Hong Kong constitution\nis indeed a very  short  and  simple  Constitution as very\nwide powers is given to the Governor and the Legislative Council .\n\n\nMatters that will usually be found in other constitutions are omitted .\n\n\nFor instance , the details of the organization of the Courts of Law ,\nthe Urban Council , and the District Boards are not given because their\nstructure and powers can be completely regulated by ordinances passed by the\nLegislative Council .\n\n\nMoreover , the Constitution does not provide for special emergency\npowers as the Governor is given wide power to act at his own discretion ,\nwithin the law , provided he reports the facts to London at once .\n\n\n \n\n\n   Australia   \n\n\n   Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 \n \n\n\n\n Here the document is divided into eight chapters .\n\n\nChapters I , II , and III make provisions for the legislature , the\nexecutive and the judiciary .\n\n\nThe first part of Ch. I vests legislative power and goes on to detail\nparliamentary machinery .\n\n\nThe executive power of the Commonwealth is vested formally in the\nQueen and made exercisable by the Governor-General under the first section\n( s. 61 ) in Ch. II of the Constitution .\n\n\nThereafter Ch. II prescribes some functions arid rules for an\nexercise of the federal power .\n\n\nThe judicial power of the Commonwealth is vested in the High Court of\nAustralia and made available for other courts by the first section (\ns. 71 ) in Ch. III . and jurisdictional provisions follow . \n\n\n\n Subsequently Ch. IV is about Finance and Trade , Ch. V the States , Ch.\nVI the New States , Ch. VII Miscellaneous and Ch. VIII the Alteration of the\nConstitution . \n\n\n\n It can be noticed that the Australian constitution is far more detailed\nthan the one in Hong Kong .\n\n\nFunctions and powers of different branches of the government are set\nout logically though not fully described .\n\n\nOne should be noted that there is a common feature between the two\nConstitutions .\n\n\nIn both constitutions there is no provision of a Bill of Rights .\n\n\n\n   IV. Three Arms Of The Government   \n\n\n\n In general theory the three arms of government , i.e. the legislature ,\nthe Executive and the judiciary , are separate from the other , separate in\npersonnel and function . \n\n\n\nHere we will take a look at the basic\nstructure of these three main parts of the two Governments . \n\n\n   Australia   \n\n\n   The Federal Parliament   ( The\nLegislature ) \n\n\n\n The Federal parliament , or \" The Parliament of the Commonwealth\n&rdquo; as it is called in Ch. I of the Constitution , is a bicameral\nlaw-making body .\n\n\nThe two chambers , the Upper and the Lower Houses , are the Senate\nand the House of Representatives , with the third component of the Queen who\nacts through the Governor-General . \n\n\n    i. The Senate    \n\n\n\n The Upper House is elected directly by the people ( S.7 of the\nConstitution ) .\n\n\nThe President of the Senate is elected by the Senate ( see\nS.17 ) who is usually the senator backed by the majority political\nparties in the Senate .\n\n\nGenerally speaking , the Senate was intended to be \" the\nStates  '  House &rdquo; , to represent the interests of the people of the\nSeveral States as a federal device , and particularly to safeguard the small\nStates against the States of New South Wales and Victoria . \n\n\n\n The Senate has the same law-making powers as the House of Representatives\nbut for one important difference&semi; namely , \" money bills  '  i.e.\nappropriation and taxation bills .\n\n\nThis limitation in money matters is one of the chief distinctions\nbetween the Senate and the House of Representatives .\n\n\n \n\n\n\n According to Lane ,  the Senate as the Upper\nHouse of Parliament has two functions .\n\n\nFirstly it is often a house of review for the many bills coming up\nfrom the main legislative chamber , the House of Representatives . \n\n\n\n Secondly , it is an investigating house .\n\n\nThrough its committed system the Senate keeps an eye on the\nbureaucracy , on public spending and on public matters generally .\n\n\nThrough this system the Senate gathers source material for good\nlegislation  . \n\n\n   ii. The House Of Representatives   \n\n\n\n Similarly , the Lower House is elected directly by the People ( S .\n24 of the Constitution ) The Speaker , the principal officer of the\nHouse , is elected by the House to preside over its meeting .\n\n\nThe Leader of the House is also a Government member , a senior\nMinister .\n\n\nHe is appointed by the Prime Minister as his delegate to arrange\nbusiness of the House .\n\n\nThe Lower House has no general Committee system but multiple\nEstimates Committees has been appointed since 1979 . \n\n\n\n In particular , the House of Representatives alone can introduce\nappropriation and tax bills .\n\n\nIt also has almost exclusive power to amend these \" money\nbills &rdquo; .\n\n\nIt has been given control of money because the Government of the day\nis drawn predominantly from the members of the controlling party in this\nHouse&semi; few of the Government  ' s Ministers sit in the Senate .\n\n\nAs a whole , the Lower House is indeed a stronger law-making body .\n\n\n\n   Hong Kong   \n\n\n   The Governor and the Legislative Council ( The\nLegislature )   \n\n\n\n According to the Letters Patent s.7 ( I ) , the authority\nto make law for peace , order and good government of Hong Kong is granted to\nthe Governor , by and with the consent of the Legislative council .\n\n\nLegCo cannot make primary legislation without the governor , who\ncannot legislate without LegCo  ' s approval .\n\n\nUnlike parliament , the LegCo is a unicameral body and does not\nexist the democratic principle of direct elections for a majority or even a\nminority of its members .\n\n\n The chief functions Of the Council are to\nenact laws , control public expenditure and put questions to the government\non matters of public interest .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "7907f99e-cd9e-4059-b2cd-088cb097cd8c", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.830107+00:00"}

{"text": "Patterns of referral to the paediatric specialist clinic of a regional\nhospital: descriptive study   \n\n\nLY So \n\n \n\n Objective. \n\n\nTo study the patterns of referral to a paediatric specialist\nout-patient clinic.\n\n\n Design . \n\n\nDescriptive study .\n\n\n Setting . \n\n\nRegional hospital , Hong Kong .\n\n\n Patients . \n\n\nThe 1985 referral letters of patients who were referred to the\npaediatric specialist clinic during 1998 were studied.\n\n\n Main outcome measures . \n\n\nCommon referral diagnoses according to sources of referral .\n\n\n Results . \n\n\nThe common sources of referral were maternal and child health centers\n( 34.7% ) , accident and emergency departments (  26.9% ) , the\nStudent Health Service (  12.9% ) , private pracitioners ( \n10.5% ) , and general out-patients clinics (  9.8% ) .\n\n\nThe common referral diagnoses from maternal and child health centers\n( n=689 ) were growth problems (  37.7% ) , heart murmurs ( \n16.8% ) , and

have established\ndiagnoses and treatment plans .\n\n\nThe impact of new cases should not be ignored , as the time spent on\na new case could be two to three times that of an old case .\n\n\nReducing the waiting time for new cases has always been a concern of\nthe community , the Hospital Authority , and specialists in Hong Kong .\n\n\nKnowledge of the referral patterns to specialist put-patient clinics\nfacilitates better planning of out-patient services .\n\n\nConversely , the referring parties will be able to identify their\ntraining needs .\n\n\nThe referral pattern also provides some background information to all\nparties concerned , so that medical care is delivered more effectively and\nefficiently .\n\n\nThese improvements are particularly important now , when resources\nfor health care are limited .   \n\n\nMethods  \n\n \n\nAll referral letters received in 1998 by the paediatric\nspecialist clinic of the Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital (  PYNEH)\nwere included in this study .\n\n\nAll letters were screened initially by a nurse and subsequently by a\ndoctor to enable an appointment to be given at the appropriate subsequently\nclinic at the appropriate time .\n\n\nDuring the screening , referral diagnoses and sources of referral\nwere recorded for later analysis .\n\n\nRelatively uncommon referral diagnoses (  including surgical or\ndermatological problems ) that did not fall into the common categories were\nclassified as  ' others ' .\n\n\nFor cases with multiple problems , only the most important was\nincluded for analysis .   \n\n\nResults  \n\n \n\nA total of 1985 referral letters were received over the 1-year\nstudy period .\n\n\nThe sources of referral in descending order of frequency were\nmaternal and child health centers (  MCHCs ) (  34.7% ) , accident and\nemergency departments (  26.9% ) , the Student Health Service ( \n12.9% ) , private practitioners (  10.5% ) , general out-patient\nclinics (  9.8% ) , and other specialties or  paediatric\ndepartment (  5.2% ) .\n\n\nThe referral diagnoses from the first five sources are shown in\nTables 1 to 5 .\n\n\nThe three most common diagnoses for MCHC referrals were growth\nproblems (  mainly deviations from standard growth charts ) , heart murmurs ,\nand neonatal jaundice (  Table 1 ) .\n\n\nKnown cases of asthma or suspected asthma in the form of cough or\nwheeze constituted 42.6% of all referrals from accident and emergency\ndepartments (  Table 2 ) .\n\n\nFor referrals from the Student Health Service , deviations from\nstandard growth curves (  particularly obesity and shortness ) were the most\ncommon reasons for referral (  Table 3 ) .\n\n\nOther reasons included precocious puberty , heart murmur , and\nnocturnal enuresis .\n\n\nThe patterns of referral from private practitioners (  Table 4 ) and\ngeneral out-patient clinics (  Table 5 ) were similar , and the common referral\ndiagnoses were asthma or cough , and neurological and cardiac problems .\n\n\nThe referrals from all sources  are summarized in Table\n6 .\n\n\nOverall , the most common reasons for referral were related to growth\n( 20.5% ) , respiration (  17.4% ) , and the heart ( \n11.9% ) .   \n\n\nDiscussion  \n\n \n\nBecause this study was based on the contents of referral letters\n, it was not possible to tell whether the referral diagnoses were\nsubstantiated or whether the referrals were justified .\n\n\nNevertheless , the study reflects the practice of the various sources\nof referral and provides information that can be used to improve referral\nprocedures and staff training .\n\n\nNo previous  descriptive accounts of local\nreferral patterns to paediatric specialist clinic could be found in the\nliterature to compare the results of this study .    \n\n\nReferrals from maternal and child health centers   \n\n \n\nThe MCHC services are provided by the Department of Health .\n\n\nEach child receives a physical check-up in the first month of life ,\nand again at 2 years and 5 years of age .\n\n\nA large number of normal children are seen at the MCHCs and ,\ninevitably , a range of nor-mal variation is encountered .\n\n\nA large proportion of the referrals from MCHCs may in fact be normal\nvariations . \n\n \n\nA large proportion of infants and children (  22.6% ) were\nreferred to the paediatric specialist clinic because of problems that were\nrelated to head size or shape , anterior fontanelle size , time of closure of\nthe anterior fontanelle , and the presence of any bony prominence on the\nskull .\n\n\nThe size of time of closure of the anterior fontanelle very greatly:\nmost paediatric textbooks state that the size varies at birth , decreases by\n 6 months of age , and closes by 12 to 18 months .\n\n\nIn a study of 704 Chinese babies from birth to age 24 months,  1\n the mean longitudinal and transverse diameters of the anterior\nfontanelle remained the same in the first 4 months of life and ranged from9mm\nto 42mm .\n\n\nThe diameters became smaller by aged 6 months , but was still patent\nin 15% and 8% of babies at age 18 months and 24 months ,\nrespectively .\n\n\nThe doctor performing the screening examination should take note of\nthis wide range of normality .\n\n\nWhile deviations in size and time of closure of the anterior\nfontanelle may be a feature in some rare conditions such as hypothyroidism ,\nskeletal abnormalities , hydrocephalus , and cranial synostosis , these\nconditions are unlikely when head growth is normal and other physical signs\nare absent .\n\n\nIn addition , although head size is usually proportional to body\nbuild , the head may be disproportionately big or small without any\npathological reason .\n\n\nSerial measurements are thus definitely more useful than\nsingle-point measurements .\n\n\nSpecial medical attention is required for babies with a head\ncircumference that crosses centiles or is at or below three standard\ndeviations from the mean . \n\n \n\nFailure to thrive , poor growth , shortness , or smallness were\ncommon referral diagnoses (  64/689;9.3% ) .\n\n\nIn general , children were refereed to the paediatric clinic for\nunsatisfactory weight gain if the body weight was close to the third centile .\n\n\nMany of them were normal healthy small-build children with a\nlength/height that was also close to the third centile; one or both parents\nmay also be short .\n\n\nSerial measurements are again essential .\n\n\nReferral to a specialist is recommended if the curve crosses two\ncentiles (  or one centile for a young child ) of if a single measurement lies\nat or below three standard deviation.  2 \n\n\nIn contrast , some apparently healthy infants were referred for\ncrossing down weight centiles in the early months of life .\n\n\nThese were usually infants with a satisfactory birhtweight , but who\nsubsequently had a reduced growth rate .\n\n\nBirthweight is dependent on maternal and intrauterine factors ,\nwhereas genetic factors determine the growth potential after birth.  2\n\n\n\nAn awareness of such a phenomenon alleviates parental anxiety and\nreduces unnecessary investigations . \n\n \n\nHeart murmur was a common reason (  116/689:16.8% ) for\nreferral , but only one fifth of infants were later found to have structural\nor functional abnormalities of the heart .\n\n\nHeart murmur are present in as high as 50% of normal children\nand most of the murmurs are innocent.  3 \n\n\nHence , doctors performing the screening examination should\nconcentrate on individuals with symptoms such as cardiopulmonary distress and\nobvious murmurs .\n\n\nThis practice , however , may be difficult for doctors who have had\nno training in cardiology .\n\n\nThe specialist clinic should try to minimise the waiting time for\nreferrals of infant with cardiac problems , because it is very difficult to\nidentify urgent cases from reading the referral letters only .\n\n\nThe PYNEH arranges for newborns with heart murmurs to be seen at the\ncardiac clinic as soon as possible because these infants are the most\nvulnerable . \n\n \n\nMany babies (  75/689; 10.9% ) were referred to the\npaediatric clinic because of jaundice that extended beyond the first 2 weeks\nof life .\n\n\nBreast-milk jaundice is a benign condition , but some diagnostic\ninvestigations are usually performed to differentiate it from non-benign\nconditions .\n\n\nUnder the present system , cases of paediatric jaundice that are\ndetected in the MCHC are referred to the hospital accident and emergency\ndepartment or paediatric specialist clinic for further management .\n\n\nThis practice had been adopted for many years , but it is not\nnecessarily the best arrangement: parents usually find it difficult to make\nmultiple visits to the hospital and MCHC .\n\n\nOne of the reasons for the referral is that doctors in MCHCs have\nlimited access to facilitates to perform laboratory investigations .\n\n\nDespite this limitation , doctors in MCHCs see a large numbers of\nbabies with jaundice .\n\n\nA jaundice meter that measures the degree of yellowness of the skin\nis frequently used to estimate the degree of jaundice , because readings\ncorrelate well with the serum bilirubin level .\n\n\nA blood sample can be taken if the reading is above a certain level ,\ndepending on the baby  ' s race and basal skin colour.  4 \n\n\nStudies in Chinese infants have shown that most newborns with serum\nbilirubin concentrations above 221 mmol/L can be identified by using the\njaundice meter , which gives a reading of > 20.  5,6 \n\n\nHowever , it is unreliable to diagnose mild jaundice by using only\nthe jaundice meter reading and the use of the meter for such a purpose has\nnot been recommended .\n\n\nFor example , a reading of 15 on the forehead may correspond to a\nserum bilirubin concentration of as high as 150 \u00b5mol/L or as low as being\nwithin the normal range.  6 \n\n\nTo render good-quality care and parental convenience , cases of\nbreast-milk jaundice should be managed by experienced primary care providers\nwho have access to laboratory investigations .    \n\n\nReferrals from accident and emergency departments   \n\n \n\nSuspected or confirmed cases of asthma formed a\ndisproportionately large proportion (  42.6% ) of all cases referred\nfrom accident and emergency departments , when compared with other services\nthat provide acute medical care such as private practitioners ( \n17.2% ) and general out-patient clinics (  12.3% ) .\n\n\nIt is not surprising that asthma is a common reason for referral ,\nbecause the prevalence of wheezing or asthma in children is approximately\n10%.  10,11 \n\n\nChildren who had attended an accident and emergency department for an\nacute asthmatic attack were referred to the specialist clinic for follow-up .\n\n\nIf there were a well-established system of family physicians in Hong\nKong , uncomplicated cases should be managed by a family physician .  \n \n\n\nReferrals from the Student Health Service   \n\n \n\nThe Student Health Service started to provide an annual physical\ncheck-up for primary and secondary school students in 1995 .\n\n\nStudents who are identified by the service as having medical and\npsychological problems are referred to specialty clinics of regional\nhospitals for further management .\n\n\nProblems related to growth and puberty developments are , as expected\n, common reasons for referral . \n\n \n\nObesity has become an important problem in Hong Kong children .\n\n\nIn a study performed in 1993 , 13.4% of boys and\n10.5% of girls aged between 6 and 18 years were found to be obese.\n 7 \n\n\nThe 38 (  14.8% ) cases that were referred to the specialist\nclinic in this study were probably only a fraction of all cases identified .\n\n\nAt the PYNEH , counseling on a group or individual basis is provided\nby doctors , dietitians , and physiotherapists to such patients .\n\n\nParents and children should be educated in the community or at\nschool acquire a habit of regular exercise .\n\n\nThese measures would be more effective than seeing a doctor after\nobesity has developed . \n\n \n\nTwenty-nine (  11.3% ) of the 256 children were referred\nfor precocious puberty .\n\n\nGenuine cases of central precocious puberty are quite rare .\n\n\nMost of the referred cases probably represent the early end of the\nage spectrum for normal sexual maturation .\n\n\nRecent studies performed in Hong Kong have shown that children now\nhave an earlier onset of pubertal development compared with children 20 to 30\nyears ago.  8,9 \n\n\nAt least 10% of Chinese girls had stage II breast\ndevelopment (  ie onset of puberty ) before the age of 8 years (  the third and\ntenth centiles were 7.10 and 7095 years , respectively).  8 \n\n\nOn the other hand , the third and tenth centiles for stage II of\ntestis development in Chinese boys were 8.4 and 9.3 years , respectively.\n 9 \n\n\nThe usual definition of precocious puberty for Caucasians (  ie onset\nof puberty before 8 years for girls and 9 years for boys ) would result in\nover investigation in approximately 7% of cases .\n\n\nDoctors should therefore consider adopting the new reference\nstandards for local children  8,9  when considering cases of\nprecocious puberty for further investigation .   \n\n\nConclusion  \n\n \n\nThis study reflects the current referral patterns of carious\nparties and quantities the major clinical problems encountered at an\nput-patient paediatric clinic of a regional hospital .\n\n\nTraining of physicians from referring parties as well as those in\nthe specialist clinic may be targeted to the common clinical problems\nidentified .\n\n\nThe training should include a thorough understanding of the clinical\nproblems , awareness of the normal variations , and knowledge of current\nreference ranges .\n\n\nHealth administrators should focus on major problem areas such as\nasthma and improve the coordination of the various care providers .\n\n\nFinally , the government and the concerned professional bodies\nshould be aware of their responsibility in promoting a healthy lifestyle to\nthe citizens of Hong Kong , starting from childhood .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source":

{"text": "The ice queen of  Canto   \n\n\n  Faye Wong was known for her scalding temper as much as her\nsinging but now she  ' s cool , collected and very much in control .\n\n\nDon't believe the hype , she tells  Vivienne Chow  \n\n\n   ' THE TRUTH  doesn't matter any more, ' intones a calm and\ncollected Faye Wong , when she is asked whether her relationship with \nCantopop  star Nicholas Tse Ting-fung is on the rocks .\n\n\nShe leans purposefully back in her comfy chair , snaps a bite out of a\nsquare of French toast and summons her assistant for another packet of Mild\nSeven cigarettes .\n\n\nIt isn't so easy to rile Faye Wong any more . \n\n\n\n Three years ago , it would scarcely have been noteworthy had the pop diva\nlaunched herself at me across the table and jammed the toast into my eye .\n\n\nAt a press conference at Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre in\n1999 , Wong lost her temper when an inquisitive journalist from Singapore\nsubmitted a question about her divorce from Beijing rock star Dou Wei .\n\n\nShe screamed at the reporter , told her it was no one  ' s business but\nher own and stormed out in the kind of dramatic huff only stars seem able to\ncarry off . \n\n\n\n All I get is a cheerful , perhaps defiant smile and a puff of cigarette\nsmoke .\n\n\nWong appears only too happy to consider the question , despite the\nover-anxious butt-in from another assistant , who says:  ' Would you please\ncancel that question! ' - intent on smothering the 32-year-old singer .\n\n\nQuite obviously , however , she can take care of herself . \n\n\n\n  ' I  ' ve already answered it, ' Wong cuts in .\n\n\nWell , actually , she hasn't .\n\n\nWhat she has said is this:  ' The main function of the entertainment\npress is to get stories that are entertaining but sometimes the truth may not\nbe as juicy as you imagine .\n\n\nEven if I answer the questions honestly , they still make up stories .\n\n\nThey have their own ideas on how my private life should be .\n\n\nI have no desire to change that image so I choose not to answer .\n\n\nIn this way they can continue to write whatever they want to. ' \n\n\n\n So she  ' s answered by questioning the question  ' s validity - that old\ncelebrity trick - but at least that toast is staying on her side of the table .\n\n\n'Sometimes the entertainment news about me covers details I have\nnever heard before,' ' she says .\n\n\n'I quite enjoy reading the stories myself .\n\n\nI  ' m just so fascinated by this .\n\n\nBut I  ' m not keen to tell people who I am or explain to people what I\nhave or haven't done .\n\n\nNow I don't really mind what has been written about me. ' \n\n\n\n That  ' s about as close an answer as anyone  ' s likely to get from Wong on\nthe state of her relationship with Tse , who is 11 years her junior .\n\n\nNot that you can really blame her .\n\n\nSince the couple walked out of a private function , hand in hand ,\ntwo years ago , they have been pursued relentlessly by the paparazzi . \n\n\n\n And that  ' s hardly surprising , given Wong is the undisputed queen of\n Cantopop  and Tse , a  Cantopop  star himself\n, is also the son of 1960s heart-throb actor Patrick Tse Yin and actress\nDeborah Lai .\n\n\nThat was more than enough star quality to send even the most haggard\nentertainment hack into a frenzy when the couple  ' s romance was first\nrevealed .\n\n\nNow there are rumours of a parting of ways , the gossip machine is\nagain moving into overdrive . \n\n\n\n But Wong has learned to be philosophical following the often fanatical\nmedia interest surrounding her marriage to Dou in 1996 and divorce three\nyears later .\n\n\n'I  ' m more open-minded now, ' she says .\n\n\n'At the beginning , I got upset quite often by the way I was\nportrayed in the newspapers and how people saw me .\n\n\nBut since I can't ask the entire world to change for me , I now look\nat these matters in a positive way. ' \n\n\n\n Until , that is , her five-year-old daughter by Dou , Ching-tung , is\nadded to the mix .\n\n\nChing-tung has been the subject of cut-throat press clamour since\neven before she was born .\n\n\nThe battle to publish the first photograph of Wong pregnant resulted\nin a court case between rival newspapers Oriental Sunday and Apple Daily .\n\n\nThe Oriental Sunday snapped the slightly swelling singer in the\nbaggage lounge of Beijing Airport in October 1996 - the first confirmation\nthat the star was expecting - and took Apple to court after it printed a\nspoiler story on the front page , including the picture , on the same day .\n\n\n\n\n Since then , even the little girl has had to run the press gauntlet .\n\n\nOn February 1 , Chinese-language entertainment magazine Sudden Weekly\npublished photographs of Ching-tung at the Hong Kong International School and\nran an interview allegedly conducted with her on her way to the school in\nRepulse Bay .\n\n\nThe interview claimed the youngster said Tse hadn't visited her\nmother for some time .\n\n\nWong was understandably furious .\n\n\nAnd for a moment , as she recounts the episode to me , the expression\nthat darkens her face would , I know , have been terrifyingly familiar to the\nunfortunate reporter at the press conference three years ago .\n\n\nWong leans forward .\n\n\nShe  ' s more serious now .\n\n\nThe interview never took place , she says .\n\n\n'I checked with my maid and spoke to my daughter .\n\n\nShe has never done this kind of interview before .\n\n\nSure , she might have said hello to someone but there couldn't have\nbeen enough time for her to tell a reporter so many details . \n\n\n\n  ' I understand people want to read about her and she cannot escape from\nbeing harassed because she is my daughter .\n\n\nIt is not harmful if they make up stories about me but she is only a\nfive-year-old child .\n\n\nCan't the public sacrifice a little bit of their curiosity so the\nchild can grow up in a healthy environment ?\n\n\nCan't they at least just wait till she  ' s older? ' \n\n\n\n Up close , it  ' s easy to see why Wong  ' s face graces so many magazine\ncovers .\n\n\nShe has beautiful , big round eyes .\n\n\nShe says her tall and slender figure requires little maintenance ,\neven after she gave birth to Ching-tung .\n\n\nAnd Wong is a trend-setter .\n\n\nWhat she wears will often become the hottest fashion items of the\nseason - even though she seems to be the only person able to carry off what\nare often quirky designs . \n\n\n\n Born in 1969 , Wong moved to Hong Kong with her family from Beijing at\nthe end of 1987 when she was 18 .\n\n\nHer enthusiasm for singing led her to the respected voice coach Tai\nSze-chung and , at just 20 , she was recommended by Tai to Cinepoly , with\nwhich she secured a record deal . \n\n\n\n In 1989 , Wong released her debut album ,  Shirley Wong Ching-man\n , a stage name she then used , which won her Commercial Radio  ' s\nUltimate Female Newcomer (  Bronze ) award .\n\n\nIn 1991 , she left for the United States to study music .\n\n\nWhen she returned the next year , she released the album  Coming\nHome  , which became her first platinum record .\n\n\nShe retrieved her real name , Wong Fei-Faye Wong - in 1994 and has\nso far made 22 studio albums . \n\n\n\n In 1997 , Wong announced she would make no more Cantonese albums when she\nleft Cinepoly for global giant EMI .\n\n\nBut she does sing the occasional Cantonese song in addition to the\nrecords in Putonghua .\n\n\n'It is a marketing decision, ' she says .\n\n\n'To sing well , one has to master the language in order to deliver\nthe best sound .\n\n\n   '  I got upset quite often by the way I was portrayed in\nthe newspapers and how people saw me , but since I can't ask the entire world\nto change for me , I now look at these matters in a positive way ' \nFaye Wong  \n\n\nPutonghua is my native tongue so naturally I  ' m more confident with\nthis language .\n\n\nBut records are considered a commodity and we must take sales into\naccount. ' \n\n\n\n Wong  ' s singing and songwriting talents , if widely recognised , are\noften tagged under the  ' alternative ' label , although she has been voted best\nfemale singer on numerous occasions in Hong Kong , the mainland and Southeast\nAsia , and took the best alternative song composition trophy last year at the\nCASH Golden Sail Awards in the SAR with  Han Wu Jie  . \n\n\n\n This kind of success usually brings a measure of satisfaction , so how\ndoes Wong still find herself singing songs she doesn't particularly like ?\n\n\n'I enjoy performing my own compositions but my taste in music is too\noff-mainstream and only a few people appreciate that, ' says Wong , who has\ncovered songs by Tori Amos and collaborated with the Cocteau Twins .\n\n\n'I know what the masses like and I know they skip my compositions and\nlisten to the commercial tracks .\n\n\nHong Kong is not like Japan , where it accommodates various musical\nstyles .\n\n\nI have too many business partners and I must consider their interests\nas well .\n\n\nI  ' m more mature now and I strike a balance between my personal\ninterests and commercial value. ' \n\n\n\n Thus , she is promoting her new film .\n\n\nIt is the Lunar New Year crowd-drawer  Chinese Odyssey 2002 \n, her fourth film , in which she plays opposite Tony Leung Chiu-wai .\n\n\nIt is also a testament to her new , more-mellow attitude .\n\n\nWhen she last played opposite Leung in  Chungking Express \nin 1994 , Wong barely spoke to her co-star .\n\n\nThis time , in a hectic two-month shoot over Christmas , she says the\npair got on well .\n\n\nLeung told the  South China Morning Post  she  ' seemed like a\ndifferent person this time .\n\n\nShe is very cheerful and friendly. ' \n\n\n\n Wong plays the role of Princess Wu Shuang , who escapes from her palace\nfor fun , often disguising herself as a man , only for both a man and a woman\nto fall for her .\n\n\n'Filming  Chungking Express  was painful for me because I\nhad no idea what I was doing at all, ' she says .\n\n\n'But  Chinese Odyssey 2002  was an enjoyable experience -\nthough I didn't have time to sleep .\n\n\nThe team spirit was fantastic. ' \n\n \n\nBut it  ' s not just her character that changed between the two\nmovies , she insists .\n\n\nWong Kar-wai , the director of  Chungking Express  , and\nJeff Lau Chun-wai , who wrote and directed  Chinese Odyssey 2002  ,\nwere two extremes .\n\n\n'As I am not confident and experienced with acting , I need\ndemonstrations on how to act, ' she says .\n\n\n'Jeff gave me very clear direction: he is willing to teach , whereas\nWong Kar-wai did not want me to understand what was on his mind .\n\n\nI just had to perform what he told me to and some of the situations\nwere quite embarrassing .\n\n\nSometimes I didn't have a clue what I was doing .\n\n\nIt was good for me because there was no need for me to analyse the\ncharacter .\n\n\nBut now I want to know more about acting. ' \n\n\n\n In Wong  ' s 1994 song  Exit  , she describes herself as having a\nlack of patience .\n\n\nThat  ' s one thing that has not changed .\n\n\nAfter 30 minutes , a clutch of cigarettes and a snack attack of\ntoast , she gets up with an  ' Is that OK?

\n\n \n\nSha Tau Kok rural committee vice-chairman Cheung Koon-yan said\nabandoned villages at Yung Shue Au , where most residents have moved to the\nurban area , were targeted . \" \n\n \n\nThere have been complaints by villagers that several pieces of\nfurniture in their huts go missing when they return home .\n\n\nSome huts are also damaged .\n\n\nIt must be the mainland immigrants who can reach there easily by boat\n, &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\nChief Inspector Maurice Watterson of Field Patrol Detachment ,\nwhich is responsible for patrolling the border , said they had never heard of\nsuch complaints . \n\n \n\nBut the rural committees said most villagers did not bother to\nreport to police .\n\n\nThere are more than 100 villages along the border . \n\n \n\nConcern over border security rose last month after the killing of\npolice sergeant Tai Choi , 43 , at a border village of Nga Yiu Ha . \n\n \n\nHe was chasing an illegal immigrant when the immigrant  ' s hand\ngrenade exploded , killing both of them . \n\n \n\nNorth district board member Liu Chun-kui , of Border Central\nconstituency , was worried the situation would worsen with the recent massive\ninflux of illegal immigrants . \n\n \n\n\" The police should review their operation and deployment\nafter the killing of the sergeant . \n\n \n\n\" We learn that some immigrants even enter villagers  '  huts\nand borrow telephones at nights .\n\n\nMore patrols are needed , &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\nPolice have arrested 15,569 illegal immigrants in the first five\nmonths this year , 32.4 per cent up from the same period last year .\n\n\nLast year police arrested a total of 33,703 immigrants . \n\n \n\nTa Kwu Ling assistant divisional commander ( operations\nand crime ) Inspector Chan Shiu-keung said they received villagers  ' \nreports occasionally but said he believed the immigrants posed little threat .\n\n\n \n\n\" It is natural that the illegal immigrants may run on\nfields and damage some crops if they are chased by police .\n\n\nI believe the damage must be very minor . \n\n \n\n\" To the illegal immigrants , it is most imperative to get\nto the city centre as quickly as possible .\n\n\nIt is very unlikely for them to make trouble for villagers which may\nattract police attention , &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\nNew Territories North regional commander , Assistant Commissioner\nof police , Douglas Lau Yuk-kuen said : \" It is not fair to generalise\nand make criticisms when , say , there are only one or two cases in several\nmonths . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nHe said it was unnecessary to set up reporting centres at remote\nvillages .  \n\n \n\n\n Split in housing protest group   \n\n\n By NG KANG-CHUNG  \n\n \n\nGRASSROOTS groups fighting the Government  ' s double-rent policy\nhave split following the arrests of 23 protesters outside the Governor  ' s\nhouse . \n\n \n\nSome groups have accused the organisers of Thursday  ' s\ndemonstration of putting the tenants at risk and others have hinted that they\nwill sever ties with them for fear of being implicated . \n\n \n\nThe protest against the Housing Authority  ' s policy to charge\nbetter-off tenants higher rents was organised by a radical pressure group ,\nHongkong People  ' s Council on Public Housing Policy . \n\n \n\nLast June the council , in protest against a seven per cent\nincrease in rents for new flats , barred authority staff from their offices ,\nforcing the authority to close for one day . \n\n \n\nOn Thursday the group led about 150 tenants to petition\nGovernment House and blocked traffic for hours .\n\n\nEarlier , some tenants scuffled with security guards at the authority\nheadquarters as they tried to break through a barricade . \n\n \n\nThe council yesterday insisted on protesting until the\ndouble-rent policy was scrapped , claiming it was against the principle of\nfairness despite some modifications by the authority . \n\n \n\nThe revised policy , which takes effect from next month ,\nrequires households with incomes between two and three times the limit for\npublic housing to pay 50 per cent more rent . \n\n \n\nThose earnings more than three times the limit will have to pay\ntwice the normal rent .\n\n\nBut they will be given preference in buying Home Ownership Scheme\nflats . \n\n \n\nFor example , a family of four who earn more than &dollar;34,200\na month will pay rent of about &dollar;2,000 , given the normal median rent\nof &dollar;1,000 . \n\n \n\nThe authority estimates that about 60,000 families will be paying\n50 per cent more and 15,000 families will pay double rent in 1993-94 . \n\n \n\nThe chairman of the Federation of Public Housing Estate Residents\nand Shop Owners Organisations , Mr Hau Shui-pui , said it was unlikely there\nwould be co-operation with the People  ' s Council in view of the latter  ' s\nradical approach . \n\n \n\nMr Hau said : \" We are civilised and reasonable men .\n\n\nSavage action cannot help much but make problems more difficult .\n\n\nAnd it risks losing public support . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nHongkong Association for Democracy and People  ' s Livelihood also\nexpressed reservation about close co-operation with the council . \n\n \n\nA spokesman said : \" Our experience has taught us that\njoint action often leads to internal arguments about who is to lead and how\nit is to be led .\n\n\nWe often make concessions to keep things going . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nIts vice-chairman , Mr Leung Kwong-cheong , said he feared\ntenants might be discouraged from taking part in petitions to avoid being\ninvolved in radical confrontation . \n\n \n\nBut the vice-chairman of the People  ' s Council , Mr Lo Chau ,\nsaid they were forced to use violence . \n\n \n\n\" We hope to be peaceful .\n\n\nBut the Government always does things to anger us . \n\n \n\n\" There would not have been any violence on Thursday had\nthe police not barricaded the road and had we been allowed to see the\nGovernor . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nDuring Thursday  ' s protest , 12 tenants and 11 council staff were\narrested .\n\n\nThey were released on police bail and required to report to the\nCentral Police Station in three weeks .  \n\n \n\n\n Few crumbs of comfort for family in tax stakes  \n\n\n\n By NG KANG-CHUNG  \n\n \n\nTHE tax cut proposals in the Budget did not bring much joy for\nengineer Mr Kelvin Wong and his family . \n\n \n\nMr Wong , 32 , a building services engineer , and his wife ,\nJanet , a medical technologist , who recently gave birth to their first child\n, Chun-kit , are renting a flat in Kowloon Bay . \n\n \n\nWith family income totalling about &dollar;50,000 a month , Mr\nWong and his wife are paying salaries tax at the standard rate of 15 per cent\nand cannot expect much benefit from the proposed 22 per cent rise in basic\ntax allowances . \n\n \n\nLast year , they were required to pay nearly &dollar;70,000 for\nsalaries tax because they were not eligible for most tax allowances , like\ndependent parents allowances . \n\n \n\nDescribing themselves as a \" taxation sandwich class family\n&rdquo; , Mr Wong said last night he was disappointed by Mr Macleod  ' s\nproposals . \n\n \n\n\" People with professional status like engineers or doctors\nwill face similar problems as we do , &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\n\" The tax allowances are not for us , but we have to\ncontribute 15 per cent of our income to the Government . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nBeing a car owner , he was also unhappy with the up to 5.7 per\ncent rise in petrol prices because of the fuel tax increase .\n\n\nHe expected he might have to pay &dollar;200 more a month . \n\n \n\nDespite tax cuts on cosmetics and stamp duty on stocks , the\nfamily said they would gain \" zero benefit &rdquo; from Mr Macleod  ' s\nproposals . \n\n \n\n\" They are insignificant reductions , &rdquo; Mrs Wong said .\n\n\n \n\n\" I seldom wear make-up and I do not think many people will\nrush to buy more cosmetics because of the tax reduction . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe only good news for Mr Wong was the &dollar;2 billion\ninjection into the Housing Society to build sandwich class flats . \n\n \n\n\" I do not have a great deal of hope in the overall Budget\n, but the sandwich class housing sounds an exciting package , &rdquo; he said .\n\n\n \n\nMr Wong and his wife have been looking for a flat since they\nmarried a year ago , but have found the prices too high . \n\n \n\n\" It is great that the Government is at last willing to do\nsomething for the sandwich class , although the proposed scheme only benefits\n3,000 families in the next three years , &rdquo; Mr Wong said . \n\n \n\n\" We are hoping for some flexible arrangements , say ,\nsetting a higher income limit and discount so that those , like us , who are\nat the upper segment of the sandwich class , can benefit . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nHe hoped the Financial Secretary could raise basic allowances for\nmarried people to &dollar;140,000 or lower the standard tax rate to 10 per\ncent to benefit the taxation sandwich class families .  \n\n \n\n\n Language test scrapped\n\n\nAssessment to decide choice of school   \n\n\n By NG KANG-CHUNG  \n\n \n\nAN examination intended to decide whether primary school pupils\ngo to Chinese or English-language secondary schools has been scrapped\nfollowing criticism from teachers and parents . \n\n \n\nInternal school assessments will now be used in an effort to ease\nthe pressure of exams on pupils , according to the Education Department .\n\n\n \n\nKnown as the Revised Method of Medium of Instruction Grouping\nAssessment , the new scheme has been approved by the Education Commission and\nwill be adopted for entry to Secondary One in September 1994 . \n\n \n\nThere will be Chinese and English subject groups under the\nrevised assessments . \n\n \n\nFor most primary pupils the English group will consist of English\nlanguage only , while the Chinese group will comprise the rest of the\nsubjects . \n\n \n\nParents and teachers will be able to judge pupils  '  English or\nChinese proficiency and decide which schools the pupils should go to , based\non the assessment results . \n\n \n\nDirector of Education Dominic Wong Shing-wah said the new scheme\nwould not mean any extra work for teachers and would lessen the pressure on\nstudents . \n\n \n\n\" As the revised method will emphasise the importance of\ncontinuous internal assessments , the principle of a balanced curriculum in\nprimary schools is upheld , &rdquo; Mr Wong said . \n\n \n\nThe department proposed the so-called Secure Hongkong Attainment\nTests in April to dictate the teaching medium for pupils . \n\n \n\nMeeting Point last night welcomed the scrapping of the tests but\nsaid the revised assessment would also add pressure to students , although\nwith fewer exams . \n\n \n\nThe group said it was unreasonable to judge a student  ' s language\nability by internal assessments , which test academic performance . \n\n \n\nIt feared the assessments would fail to achieve their intended\naim , because most parents regarded English as more important than Chinese .\n\n\nThe parents might press their children to work hard at English so as\nto send them to an English-medium school . \n\n \n\nIt urged the Government to scrap the language streaming policy\nand make more effort to promote mother-tongue education . \n\n \n\nThe Hongkong Professional Teachers Union also said the department\nshould try to promote mother-tongue education with the new assessment . \n\n \n\nUnion chairman and legislator Cheung Man-kwong said the\ndepartment should regularly send inspectors to monitor English-stream classes\nto make sure teachers were qualified to teach in English and the students\nwere able to learn with that medium of instruction .  \n\n \n\n\n Motorists face rise at pumps   \n\n\n By K. C. NG  \n\n \n\nWITHIN hours of the Budget announcement motorists were paying up\nto 5.7 per cent more for their petrol .  \n\n \n\nThe leaded petrol price was up from &dollar;7.70 to &dollar;8.14\nper litre , while lead-free petrol jumped from &dollar;7.41 to &dollar;7.80 .\n\n\nDiesel went up from &dollar;5.09 to &dollar;5.29 per litre . \n\n \n\nOil companies said last night the new prices reflected the rise\nin tax on a cent-for-cent basis . \n\n \n\nThe marketing director of Shell , Mr Bruce Tremayne , said :\n\" The higher excise duties are payable immediately .\n\n\nTherefore , we have no choice but to adjust our prices accordingly .\n&rdquo; \n\n \n\nMr Macleod said the 9.5 per cent increase in fuel duty was in\nline with the inflation rate so as to \" maintain the real value &rdquo;\nof the duty . \n\n \n\nSome environmental protection groups , however , said the petrol\nduty differentiation was not big enough to encourage motorists to switch to\nlead-free petrol . \n\n \n\nConservancy Association spokesman Mr Gordon Ng Ting-leung said :\n\" It is contradictory to the &lsquo;

said Mr Cheung . \n\n \n\nOne notorious black spot is near the junction of Jaffe Road and\nCannon Street , a few blocks from the Excelsior Hotel . \n\n \n\nResidents say there are about 20 hawkers operating cooked food\nstalls from 11 pm to 3 pm every night . \n\n \n\nMrs Tam Chan Yuen-yan said , \" We usually watch television\nuntil 3 am .\n\n\nYou simply cannot sleep until then because they are so noisy .\n\n\nYou can even hear clearly what dishes the people order . \n\n \n\nWe even had to arrange for our two children to go to\nkindergarten in the afternoon . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe Tam family , who moved into their second-floor flat at\nCannon Street last year , say they are looking for a new apartment . \n\n \n\n\" We cannot stand it any longer , &rdquo; Mrs Tam said .\n\n\n \n\nWan Chai District Board chairman Mrs Peggy Lam Pei Yu-dja\ndescribed the seriousness of the hawker problem in her district as \"\nunbelievable &rdquo; . \n\n \n\nShe suggested that the Government followed the Singapore example\nof moving all hawkers into multi-storey markets . \n\n \n\nMrs Tam  ' s neighbour , Mr Sammy Chan , criticised the Government  ' s\nlack of a long-term policy to crack down on hawkers in the district . \n\n \n\n\" We may have one or two hours of peace and quiet\nsometimes when the Urban Services Department people are here to clear them\noff .\n\n\nBut when that have gone , all the hawkers return , &rdquo; said Mr\nChan . \n\n \n\nAnother Cannon Street resident , Mr Robert So said : \" The\ntraffic here is very busy , particularly at night .\n\n\nBut the pavements are covered with hawkers .\n\n\nWe are often forced to walk on the roadways. &rdquo;

{"text": "Chapter 10    \n\n\nInfections of the Central Nervous System    \n\n\nS. T. CHAN  \n\n \n\nIn Hong Kong , infections of the central nervous system (\nCNS ) have always been a significant cause of mortality and morbidity .\n\n\nGenerally speaking , as a society develops and its standard of medical\nand health care improves , one would expect a progressive decline in the\nincidence of infectious diseases .\n\n\nHowever , a review of the statistics on CNS infections in Hong Kong\nshowed that this has not been the case ( Table 10.1 ) . \n\n \n\nTaking the case of tuberculosis ( TB ) as an example\n, statistics from the government showed that the total number of TB cases in\ngeneral and TB meningitis in particular showed no significant change over the\nlast 11 years .    \n\n \n\nIn fact there appears to be a rising trend in the number of new\ncases of TB infection in the recent 2 years .\n\n\nThis observation is explained by the close proximity of Hong Kong to\nChina , where poverty and infection are still major problems .\n\n\nIn neighbouring provinces across the Chinese border , public health\nstandards are still in a developing stage .\n\n\nTB is particularly rampant . \n\n \n\nOver the years , neurosurgeons have been actively involved in the\noverall management of different kinds of CNS infections .\n\n\nFrom helping in the initial diagnosis to managing the complications\nof various infections , we have worked closely with our colleagues in other\nspecialties .\n\n\nOur neurosurgeons have acquired vast experience in dealing with a\nlarge variety of infections , ranging from the common to the very rare cases .\n  \n\n\nMENINGITIS  \n\n \n\nThe commonest infection of the CNS by far is meningitis .\n\n\nIn spite of recent advances and the availability of many new and\npotent antimicrobial treatments , meningitis still  carries a\nformidable mortality rate .\n\n\nDelayed diagnosis often leads to severe and permanent morbidity .\n\n\nA high index of suspicion is very important , especially in cases\nwhere meningeal signs and fever may not be present initially .\n\n\nThose at risk include the very young and those taking steroids . \n\n \n\nAnother worrying trend is an increasing number of patients\npresenting with partially treated bacterial meningitis .\n\n\nFor every case of confirmed bacterial meningitis , there are two to\nthree cases of meningitis due to unspecified cause .\n\n\nMost of these represent partially treated cases where the causative\nbacteria cannot be cultured .   \n\n\nLocal citizens have a tendency to visit multiple practitioners over a\nshort period of time .\n\n\nSome local physicians also harbour a cavalier attitude in prescribing\nantibiotics .\n\n\nThis results in a real risk of delayed diagnosis of meningitis with\ndire consequences . \n\n \n\nFor those cases of chronic or subacute meningitis caused by TB or\ncryptococcus , meningeal signs may not be apparent .\n\n\nMany such cases are diagnosed only after neurosurgical consultation ,\nwhen lumbar puncture would be performed . \n\n \n\nThe following statistics ( Table 10.2 ) were\ncollected from all hospitals ( private and government/hospital\nauthority ) in Hong Kong .\n\n\nThey show the incidence of meningitis caused by all kinds of\ninfective agents    and highlight the fact that\neven today meningitis still causes significant mortality : one will also note\nthat there is no significant change in the  incidence or the\nresult of treatment . \n\n \n\nApart from bacterial and viral meningitis , TB meningitis is a\nrather common occurrence , as shown in table 10.1 .\n\n\nThis explains the great interest in this topic , leading to many\nreports and studies published by our colleagues in the fields of neurology ,\nneuroradiology and neurosurgery .\n\n\nTheir efforts add to our ever-increasing knowledge of these disease\nprocesses and contribute to better results in the management of this disease .\n   \n\n \n\nAlthough cases of meningitis are primarily managed by physicians\nand paediatricians , neurosurgeons are often involved in the management when\ncomplications arise .\n\n\nThese complications include ventriculitis , hydrocephalus , granuloma\nand abscess formation .\n\n\nSurgical procedures include insertion of ventricular catheters and\nreservoirs for intra-ventricular antibiotics , shunting operations for\nhydrocephalus and excision or drainage of brain abscess or granuloma . \n \n\n\nABSCESS FORMATION IN THE CNS  \n\n \n\nBrain and spinal abscess formation are by no means uncommon in\nHong Kong .\n\n\nThe following statistics from Queen Elizabeth Hospital ( Table\n10.3 ) , one of the large Neurosurgical Units in town , illustrate the\nkinds of abscesses managed by Hong Kong neurosurgeons .  \n \n\n\nVIRAL INFECTIONS  \n\n \n\nViral infections of the CNS are common .\n\n\nFortunately most cases resolve without complications .\n\n\nHowever , viral encephalitis sometimes results in life-threatening\ncerebral oedema , and neurosurgical assistance is called for .\n\n\nSurgical procedures include insertion of catheter for intracranial\npressure monitoring and brain biopsy to confirm the diagnosis .\n\n\nCases of postinfectious viral transverse myelitis have also been\nencountered , although not frequently .     \n\n\n\nFUNGAL INFECTIONS  \n\n \n\nThe most common fungal infection of the CNS seen locally is\ncryptococcal meningitis .\n\n\nInfection by Cryptococcus neoformans leads to inflammation of\nmeninges and blood vessels .\n\n\nPatients may present acutely with symptoms of diffuse encephalitis .\n\n\nOther times the disease may take a subacute or even chronic course ,\nwithout much meningeal sign .\n\n\nChronic headache and cranial nerve palsy may be the only complaint .\n\n\nThe mainstay of treatment is the use of antifungal agents like\namphotericin B , 5-flurocytosine or derivatives of the imidazole group .\n\n\nA local case where the meningitis recurred over a period of 5 years\nin spite of treatment has been reported .    \n\n \n\nIn addition to antifungal treatment , ventriculoperitoneal\nshunting operations may be necessary for cases complicated by hydrocephalus .\n\n\nNo case of spread to the peritoneal cavity has been recorded . \n\n \n\nOccasional cases of fungal abscesses have also been seen .\n\n\nCraniotomy and drainage of pus together with antifungal treatment\ngave successful results .\n\n\nIsolated cases of rarer fungal infection like cerebral aspergillosis\nhave also been reported .   \n\n\nAt the time of writing , a case of aspergillosis mycotic aneurysm has\nbeen diagnosed by the team in Tuen Mun Hospital and will soon be reported .\n\n\nThe majority of current and past patients with fungal infection were\nnot associated with AIDS or other immunosuppression state .   \n\n\nPARASITIC INFESTATION    \n\n\nCysticercosis  \n\n \n\nThe commonest parasitic infestation of the CNS seen in Hong Kong\nis cysticercosis .\n\n\nPatients become infected after ingesting larvae of Taenia solium in\n  under-cooked  pork .\n\n\nAlthough the Hong Kong government has stringent rules governing the\nslaughter and distribution of pork , this is not the case in Mainland China .\n\n\nMany patients are infected while travelling to China .\n\n\nAs it is not a notifiable disease , no comprehensive data about the\nincidence of cysticercosis is available .\n\n\nFrom personal communications with various local centers , the author\nestimates an incidence of around 10 to 15 new cases per year .\n\n\nWith more cross-border traffic , the incidence is expected to rise\nfurther . \n\n \n\nIn most cases the diagnosis of cerebral cysticercosis is obvious\nwhen a computed tomography ( CT ) or magnetic resonance\n( MR ) scan shows widespread multiple cystic lesions in the\nparenchyma of the brain .\n\n\nSometimes however a solitary cyst may be the only manifestation .\n\n\nThe author has had the experience of removing an intact larval cyst\nfrom within the spinal dural sac while exploring a case of nerve root\ncompression .\n\n\nThere was no other lesion detectable elsewhere . \n\n \n\nOther diagnostic pitfalls include missing the diagnosis by only\nrequesting a nonenchance CT scan .\n\n\nIn the early stages of the disease , before calcifications occur in\nthe cyst wall , the cysts may only be visible after contrast injection . \n\n \n\nManagement by the antihelmintic praziquantel is usually\nsuccessful , although sometimes massive inflammatory responses occur and may\neven cause cerebral infarct .   \n\n\nNeurosurgery is reserved for cases complicated by hydrocephalus or\ncystic compression on neural structures .  \n\n\n Sparganosis  \n\n \n\nAnother peculiar larval infestation of the CNS seen in Hong Kong\nis Sparganosis .\n\n\nIn theses local cases migrating larvae of Diphyllobothrium mansoni\nmost likely enter the human body through drinking water contaminated with\ninfected Cyclops .\n\n\nHong Kong  ' s drinking water is recognized as safe by the World Health\nOrganization .\n\n\nThe majority of local cases were probably infected in China where\nclean drinking water is not guaranteed . \n\n \n\nBack in 1987 , this condition was supposed to be of very rare\noccurrence and only eight cases had been reported world-wide .\n\n\nHowever , the author published two personal cases encountered in 1986\nand 1987 ,    and predicated a much higher incidence\nonce this disease became better known and the differential diagnosis is\nconsidered in relevant cases .\n\n\nSince then , more cases have been found locally  \n and this condition is now recognized to be more common in Hong Kong and\nneighbouring Southern China . \n\n \n\nPresenting as granulomas in the brain or spinal cord , the\ndiagnosis was confirmed only after histological specimen was available\nthrough exploration and biopsy .\n\n\nIn one of the author  ' s cases a 5-inch long larva was literally\ncaught from within an intraparenchymal granuloma at exploration for a case of\nsuspected glioma .   \n\n\nAIDS ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS  \n\n \n\nWith the increasing prevalence of the Acquired Immunodeficiency\nSyndrome ( AIDS ) in Hong Kong , a higher incidence of CNS\ninfections associated with the syndrome is to be expected .\n\n\nIndeed cases of brain abscess in AIDS patients have been encountered .\n     \n\n\nOTHER MISCELLANEOUS INFECTIONS  \n\n \n\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease was first reported locally in 1987 .\n   \n\n \n\nCases of amoebic meningoencephalitis due to Naegleria fowleri\nhave also been seen locally .\n\n\nAgain in most cases the exposure was thought to have happened in\nChina .\n\n\nThe mortality was very high as diagnosis was often delayed .\n\n\nYet successful treatment was reported in a 38-year-old man . \n    \n\n\nSUMMARY  \n\n \n\nHong Kong is one of the world  ' s most sophisticated metropolises\nwith an advanced medical and health system .\n\n\nYet due to her close historic connection with China , infective\ndiseases of the CNS have always been a common occurrence .\n\n\nNow after her reunification with China in 1997 , cross-border\ntraffic is expected to grow at an ever-increasing rate .\n\n\nInfections of the CNS will certainly remain a major focus of our\nneurosurgical practice .  \n\n \n\n\n  Chapter 11    \n\n\nSpinal Surgery    \n\n\nC.K. Wong  \n\n \n\nThe spinal cord , perhaps because of its simpler anatomy and\nsmaller size , has less pathology than its cerebral counterpart .\n\n\nWhile it is enclosed in a bony canal , well protected by muscles and\nbone , its function is very much dependent on the well being of the vertebrae\nand intervertebral structures such as disc and joints .\n\n\nTherefore , in managing spinal pathologies , the surgeons have to be\nconversant not only with the respective nervous diseases but also diseases of\nthe bone and joints , and the biomechanics of the spine as a whole . \n \n\n\nTHE PAST  \n\n \n\nIn the early days of neurosurgical services in Hong Kong , due\nto the paucity of resources , material or human alike , focus was set only on\nthe brain .\n\n\nThe rest of the central nervous system , the vertebrae in particular\n, was left to the orthopaedic colleagues .\n\n\nCoupled to the longer history and good reputation of orthopaedics in\nHong Kong , it had been the common practice for family physicians to refer\npatients with problems related to the spine first to the orthopaedic surgeons .\n\n\nIt was then up to the orthopaedic surgeons to refer to neurosurgeons\nthose they found in apt to handle .   \n\n\nTHE PRESENT  \n\n \n\nThrough the years , as neuroimaging technology advances ,\ndiagnosis can be made with greater ease and confidence .\n\n\nProblems are classified earlier in the course of treatment .\n\n\nThis helps to define our territory to diseases within the dura .\n\n\nUnlike our counterparts abroad , we manage just a very small\nproportion of degenerative spinal disease . \n\n \n\nMost of us believe that we should be more active in the\nmanagement of bony spinal  pathologies such as degenerative\nspinal disease and spinal trauma .\n\n\nThere are two reasons .\n\n\nFirst , the clinical indications of spinal surgery are usually\nneurological in nature .\n\n\nA neurosurgeon is undoubtedly in the best position to assess and\npredict the outcome of the treatment program .\n\n\nSecond , with our traditional meticulous care in tissue handling ,\nwe are well capable to work on the spine with the least trauma . \n\n \n\nAt present , we are able to provide treatment to a large variety\nof these conditions .\n\n\nThe following three cases illustrate the scope of service we are\ncurrently providing .   \n\n\nCase 1  \n\n \n\nA 6-year-old boy presented with 2 months  '  history of neck pain\nfollowed by weakness of all limbs .\n\n\nPhysical examination demonstrated mild spastic tetraparesis .\n\n\nSphincter functions and sensation were intact .\n\n\nX-ray of the cervical spine was normal .\n\n\nMagnetic resonance ( MR ) imaging ( Fig. 11.1A\n) showed an intradural cystic lesion lying anterior to the spinal cord\nwith signal intensity similar to cerebral spinal fluid .\n\n\nIt extended from  C4 to C6 level .\n\n\nThe spinal cord was badly compressed and deformed . \n\n \n\nAfter the scan , there was rapid deterioration of neurological\nsigns including respiratory distress , acute urinary retention and\nprogressive tetraparesis .\n\n\nUrgent anterior corpectomy at the level of C4-C7 was done .\n\n\nIntraoperative finding showed a thin walled , tense whitish cyst\ncontaining turbid yellowish fluid .\n\n\nFor an area of around 3 mm in diameter , the cyst was firmly\nattached to the anterior surface of the cord .\n\n\nTotal excision was achieved .\n\n\nThe C4-C7 corpectomy was subsequently stabilised with a fibular\nstrut graft .\n\n\nThe pathology was neurenteric cyst . \n\n \n\nThe patient was put on a Philadelphia collar for 3 months .\n\n\nNeurological improvement was remarkable and by the end of 3 months ,\nthe patient was free of symptoms .\n\n\nFollow-up MR imaging ( Fig. 11.1B ) showed complete\nresolution of the cyst with satisfactory alignment of the bone graft . \n \n\n\nCase 2  \n\n \n\nA 31-year-old lady complained of progressive left upper limb\nweakness for 3 years .\n\n\nPhysical examination showed marked wasting of small muscles of both\nhands with loss of pinprick sensation at C7-T1 level on the right side .\n\n\nOn the left side , there was loss of pinprick and temperature\nsensation at C6-T1 level .\n\n\nThe lower limb functions were normal .\n\n\nSphincter functions were normal . \n\n \n\nMR imaging ( Fig. 11.2A ) of the cervical spine\nshowed a sausage shape tumour practically  occupying the\nwhole thecal sac at C2-T1 level .\n\n\nNo normal spinal cord was visualised in the intervening level .\n\n\nThere was syringobulbia extending down to the superior surface of\nthe tumour .\n\n\nPreoperative somato-sensory evoked potential ( SSEP )\nwas normal in both upper and lower limbs . \n\n \n\nLaminectomy at C2-T1 level was done .\n\n\nThrough a midline myelotomy , the tumour was found to be firm in\nconsistency and was adherent to the cord tissue .\n\n\nThough difficult , it was possible to create a cleavage plane\nbetween the tumour and spinal cord by careful dissection from the cephalic\nend .\n\n\nTotal excision was achieved .\n\n\nStabilisation was achieved by posterior fixation from C2 to T1 level\nusing two titanium rods and bone graft .\n\n\nIntraoperative SSEP recorded a reduction of the amplitude of the\ncortical response from the lower limbs .\n\n\nThe tumour was an ependymoma . \n\n \n\nAfter surgery , the patient was put on a halo-jacket for 6 weeks .\n\n\nMR imaging ( Fig. 11.2B ) 1 year later showed no\nrecurrence .\n\n\nIn the latest follow-up , there is good recovery of the function of\nthe small muscles of both hands to grade 4 power .\n\n\nSensory loss , however persist .\n\n\nProprioception of both lower limbs is normal .\n\n\nThe remaining complaint is the pain and stiffness associated with\nextensive spinal fixation .   \n\n\nCase 3  \n\n \n\nA 6-year-old boy with neonatal asphyxia and spastic diplegia was\nreferred for surgical treatment of spasticity .\n\n\nPhysical examination showed bilateral ankle clonus and marked tone\nincrease in the adductors and , to a lesser extent , the abductors of the hip .\n\n\nHe could only stand for a few seconds at a time and walk in a very\nunstable gait with two walking-sticks .\n\n\nThe primary problem was spasticity causing poor hip control . \n\n \n\nSelective dorsal root rhizotomy ( Fig. 11.3 )\nunder motor nerve stimulator monitoring ( Fig. 11.4 ) was done .\n\n\nAfter surgery , the tone in both hips was markedly reduced and\nbilateral ankle clonus abolished completely .\n\n\nDespite mild weakness of the respective muscle group initially ,\nwith continuing intensive physiotherapy which is indeed an integral pat of\nthe rhizotomy program , he was able to stand and walk much faster unaided\nafter 3 months . \n\n \n\nThese three cases vary in complexity and yet have one thing in\ncommon .\n\n\nIn the course of surgery , we found it important to use\nelectrophysiological monitoring to guide us through the spinal cord .\n\n\nIn recent years , local neurosurgeons like to have intraoperative\nmonitoring backup in spinal work .\n\n\nThis has incurred additional strain on the already depleted service\nof the neurologists and the electrodiagnostic units .\n\n\nIn turn , this adds to our difficulty in handling complicated cases\nwith the greatest confidence and safety .   \n\n\nTHE FUTURE  \n\n \n\nKnowing our capability in treating spine pathology , we are\ntrying to get more recognition , and perhaps a fairer share in the field of\nspinal surgery .\n\n\nOnly with better coordination and pooling of resources and referrals\namong ourselves can we provide an environment conducive to cultivating this\nsubspecialty .\n\n\nOnly when some of us are able to spend most if not all of our time\ndoing spinal surgery can the expertise expand well and fast enough .\n\n\nThese call for better co-operation and a major restructuring of our\ncurrent practice .\n\n\nIn the author  ' s opinion , this is a job for the Neurosurgical\nSpecialty Board of the College of Surgeons and the neurosurgical community at\nlarge .   \n\n\nCONCLUSION  \n\n \n\nAt the turn of the new century , whether our neurosurgical\nservice can move forward and improve the quality of our care to spine\npatients depends much on our courage to radically change the existing\nstructure .", "subdomain":

{"text": "b ) Retrogradation \n \n\nStarch granule compose of both  amylose and\namylopection .\n\n\nAmylose is  mainly straight chain with more\nthan 200 glucose subunit join  together by\n&alpha;1-4 linkage .\n\n\nFor Amylopectin , there is branch chain by &alpha;1-6 linkage .\n\n\nThe side chain  usually with 25 unit of glucose . \n \n\nIn starch granule , they are  located\ntogether .\n\n\nWhen the starch granule is  soaked in  enough water the water go into the granule and cause swelling .\n\n\nWhen it is heat ,  at around 40-50&degree;C , \ngelatinization  take place and amylose first come out .\n\n\nThen the amylopectin come out later when  temp\nrise .\n\n\nThis cause increase in viscosity and the starch granule take up water .\n\n \n\n When the solution of gelatinized starch is\ncooled .\n\n\nThe amylose  chain with the glucose unit act\ntogether .\n\n\n The hydroxyl group and hydrogen atom interact\ntogether to form  hydrogen bond .\n\n\nIf the cooling temp is quick , the  glucose\nunit in the chain do not  organized well and\nthere is great space between the    chain ,\nwater is hold  in  this space and a gel is \nform . \n \n\nFor  the  gel is stored for long\ntime ,  the amylose chain crystalize  .\n\n\nThe amylose chain straighten  and there is\nwell organize structure formed .\n\n\nThe amylose chain form a zipper structure .\n\n\nThe water  formerly held in the\nspace between the chain is expelled from the chain and water lose . \n \n\n As the <unc> \n</unc> amylose \ncrystalized .\n\n\nThe  gel structure become rubbery\nand opaque .\n\n\n The whole process is called Retrogradation .\n\n \n\nRetrogradation take place  mainly in the  amylose chain which have the chain to length about 200\nglucose .\n\n\nAs the cereal starch usually have  amylose\nchain about 200 glucose , therefore the  cereal\nstarch is  low in quality .\n\n\nAmylopectin do not retrograde  easily because of the\nbranch chain and short  chain  . \n \n\nIf the gel is cooling store the ice crystal is form in the gel\nand the size of the crystal increase during the storage .\n\n\nWhen the gel is  thaw .\n\n\nThe ice crystal melt and the water provide  space for\nthe amylose chain to mobile , the chain  form  crystallization and the water  formerly  held is\n expell .\n\n\nWatery gel and opaque , rubby gel is form .\n\n\nThis is call syneresis and is a kind of Retrogradation . \n \n\n In bread\nbaking , the amylose leach out and form  stable gel outside\nthe granule  but amylopectin stay inside the granule .\n\n\nAfter store a period of time the amylose do not  retrograde because it is stable but the  amyolpectic do retrograde .\n\n\n The formerly expand side chain  form crystallization  inside the granule .\n\n\nThen the bread become hard  .\n\n\n Also The bread    will  \nlose it taste and  crust become\ntough . \n \n\nThese  undesirable change is\ngroup and call staling Retrogradation of the amylopectin become take part in\nthis process . \n \n\nThe  improve the gel strength\nmodification of starch chain can be use .\n\n\n It include acid modified and  crosslinkage .  \n\n\n4 ( c ) Crosslinkage \n \n\nCrosslinkage of starch required the formation of diester of\nstarch <unc> 3-characters </unc> .\n\n\n Sodium diphosphate is involved in the interlinkage of\n2 starch chain .\n\n\nThe  diphosphate  interact\nwith the  glucose unit of the amylose and\namylopectin chain  and make\nthem link together .\n\n\nThe net result is increase the size of chain .\n\n\nThis cause change in physical property of the starch . \n \n\n The increase size  starch granule will have a increase range of gelatinization and the\ngelatinization temp also increase . \n \n\nIt is because  linked starch\nchain swell less and not easy to leach out the granule . \n \n\n The linkage of\nstarch   restricts  the expansion of the granule so\nthe granule swell less . \n \n\n There\n is even some intact  starch granule at high temp eg. 100&degree;C . \n \n\nAs less starch chain leach out , there is less resistance in the\nsolution  .\n\n\nSo the  viscosity of linked starch\nsolution is lower . \n \n\n In normal starch ,  the viscosity of the solution decrease due to shear\nthinning but it is not the case in the linked starch as less starch in the\nsolution . \n \n\n As shown in diagram when the  acidity increase , the normal starch with have\nviscosity decrease , but not in the linked starch .  \n \n\nIn acidic ,  the  acid hydrolysis of starch chain take place and\nmake the starch chain decrease in size\n\n\nthis make the starch chain interact together more well and cause\ngreater resistance to the flow so rise in the viscosity . \n \n\nCross-linkage has significant effect in gel quality . \n \n\n The rate of \nRetrogradation is dependent on the ease of the starch chain to  move inside the gel to  form\ncrystallization .\n\n\nCrosslinkage make the starch chain become difficult so that the gel\nis stable and do not form opaque  rubby gel\neasy .\n\n\nThe  gel make from it \ncan store longer without quality chain . \n \n\nAlso  as there is less , starch chain in the  linked starch solution .\n\n\nThe gel form it do not have much  \n interaction between the neighbour chain .\n\n\nWhen the gel is cut , the cut is  sharp .\n\n\nThis quality is important in  jelly making . \n \n\nAs the quality of cereal starch can be increase by cross linkage\n,  this method is very\nimportant in industry .\n\n\nBecause a cheaper cereal starch such as corn can change into high\nquality starch .  \n\n\n3 \n \n\n Corn grain is very important because all the\ncorn plant can be use without  waste .\n\n\nThe  germ in corn can be extracted for oil .\n\n\nThe starch can be  converted into sweetener .\n\n\nThe starch remain part of corn plant can be  used for\nalcohol production while the residue can be use as animal feed . \n \n\nTherefore  a   whole  corn\nplant can be used up  to produce high value good and\nless waste treatment is required as less waste is produced .\n\n\nSo corn  grow in important . \n \n\nIn the production of  corn\nproduct .\n\n\nThe corn is wet milled to produced and   separate\n all the  chemical component .\n\n\nThen the separate is used for different production .\n\n\nFor sweetener product it account for 75% of corn starch use\nand 50% sweetener market .\n\n\nIn  this production , the\nstarch is first thinned by enzyme ie &alpha; amylase or \n&beta; amylase and  under heating .\n\n\nThe long starch chain is broken  into smaller size\nstarch chain . \n \n\n When the  thinning\nof starch product and dextrose equilviant DE of 10-15 .\n\n\nThe  thinning is stopped and the thinning\n go for saccarification . \n \n\nIn this process ,  glucoamylase which can break\nstarch chain completely to its glucose <unc> 1-word </unc> .\n\n\nTo aid the process ,  pullulase is also act to break\nthe &alpha;1-6 side chain .\n\n\nBy this method , high amount of dextrose with DE over 99.8 is\nproduced .\n\n\nThe dextrose can be shipped for sale or convert to high fructose corn\nsyrup  HFCS . \n \n\nIn the production of HFCS , the dextrose is convert be  isomerase .\n\n\nThis enzyme convert  dextrose to\nfructose .\n\n\nWith suitable environment , 42% fructose can be produce and\n this with similar sweetness of sucrose .\n\n\nThe HFCS product can be shipped for sale or further processed to\nincrease the fructose concentration .\n\n\nThe   fructose  is purified by chromatography\nto give 90%   fructose  . \n \n\nThis   fructose  solution can be dilute\nwith <del  <unc> > 1-character </unc>  42% fructose to\ngive 55% fructose which have the same sweetness of sucrose .\n\n\nFor the starch , it can be modified to   mimic \nhigh value starch . \n \n\nAlso , oil extraction is also a main use of  corn .\n\n\nThe germ separated from wet milling is crusted to  press  oil out .\n\n\nUsually 80% oil can be obtain .\n\n\nThe  expressed germ meal is extracted with\nsolvent to recover the remain oil . \n \n\nAs mention before , the remain of corn plant and the  residue in wet milling can be used\nwithout waste . \n \n\n\n\nThese  remain  part is\nfirst digested by enzyme such as cellulose , &alpha; and &beta;  amylase to give fermentable sugar .\n\n\nThen yeast or other alcohol production  microorganism can be added to  produce\nalcohol for industrial use .\n\n\nThe alcohol can mixed with   petroleum  to\ngive gasohol  as car  fuel  .\n\n\nThis process is practise in Brazil . \n \n\n To produce Beverage alcohol corn starch can\nused for alcohol production with the similar method . \n \n\nTherefore corn is very useful and high value .\n\n\nThe corn is grow in the poor country to improve their income .  \n \n\nCorn growing is possible  is most part of\nworld .\n\n\nChina has a large piece of land and she can also grow corn to\nimprove their income . \n \n\nAlthough the industry  processing of corn is not\ncommon in China , she can export the corn to country for sale or use  it in another way .\n\n\nAnimal Breeding is common  in china .\n\n\nShe can grow corn to  provide feed for these\nanimal .\n\n\n By this method , low price corn can be convert into\nhigh value animal meat for sale \n \n\nFor the feed production , the corn is also wet milled .\n\n\nThe steep corn liquid which high in soluble protein eg. albumin\n is mixed with the germ as bran to produced Corn Gluten Feed .\n\n \n\nThis feed is high energy to the ruminant because it is high in\nfiber .\n\n\nIt can be used to fatten the cow and other ruminant before sale .\n\n \n\nThere are also  other  feed\nproduced from the corn such as Corn Gluten meal which is high in the glutent\nand Corn germ meal which high in fat .\n\n\nSupplement of feed can be  added\nby putting the residue of  alcoholic  waste to the feed . \n \n\nAs corn is low in lysine content , it  should be  feed with\nsoya bean to balance the feed .\n\n\nWith a right  combination of the feed\n Right amt of nutrient can provide for the\nanimal growth . \n \n\nTherefore ,  corn is really a valuable\nplant as all of the part of corn plant can be use without waste .  \n\n\n1 \n \n\n In wheat , 4 type of protein\nis found .\n\n\nThey are  water soluble \n albumin  ,  dilute salt solution ,\nsoluble globulin , alcohol soluble  prolamine and\nweak acid &ampersand; base soluble gluteline . \n \n\nThe  first two albumin &ampersand;\nglobulin  contain high value amino acid but the last two  prolamine and gluteline  contain\nless essential amino acid such as lysine .\n\n\nActually the prolamine and glutelin  are storage\nprotein  and they have similar amino acid component and they\nare  called gluten \n \n\n The major wheat product is bread because only\nwheat flour can  form dough .\n\n\nThe quality of the bread produced can be determined by the  nutrition value , texture and taste of the  bread . \n\n \n\n In term of\nnutrition , high lysine content in the bread is \ndesirable .\n\n\n While the lysine\ncontent is determined by the storge protein content .\n\n\nIf the amt of storage protein  is\nhigh .\n\n\nThis low lysine content protein will dilute the amt of lysine in the\n flour  and reduce the nutrition\nlevel . \n \n\nThe amount of storge product is determined by genetic and the\nnutrient supply in the final stage of growth .\n\n\nHigh nutrient in the final grow stage will increase the storage\nprotein content but less rise in the lysine rich albumin and globulin level .\n\n\nThis problem can be solved by  growing\ngenetically modified  low storage protein cultivar . \n \n\nFor the texture ,  prolamine\nprovides a less resistant to flow properties to the dough  when   prolamine  is hydrated .\n\n\nAlso it also   gives  a sticky\nproperties .\n\n\nHowever glutelin is resistance to flow and give elastic properties\nto the dough when hydrated .\n\n\nThese  storage\nprotein  act together to give the unique    spread  flow characteristic to dough and\naccount for the texture of bread . \n \n\nFor a bread to be  made , the flour should be\nmixed with other ingredient to give dough .\n\n\nThe dough is then  formed   and bake . \n \n\nIn the mixing , the amount of glutent ( storage protein\n) affect the mixing time .\n\n\nGlutent is high in Disulphur bond ( -S-S- ) .\n\n\nThe disulphur can interconvert with - SH ie. -S-S-\n&bidirectional-arrow; - SH .\n\n\nIn the  presence of the fast \nacting oxidant the  - SH bond will be convert to - S-S- bond .\n\n\nThis make the amt of -S-S- bond increase .\n\n\nThe -S-S- will then  be  formed thiyl radicle which attack\nthe activated double bond .\n\n\nThis attack  reduce the\nmixing time of dough and it will cause overmixing  easily is\ncontrol of mix time is ineffective . \n \n\nThe overmixed dough will be glossy , watery as water is release\nfrom the chain .\n\n\nThe dough become sticky and lose the desirable  properties .\n\n\n The  bread\nmake from this will have poor texture . \n \n\nTherefore high storage protein content make  dough overmix easily and it form poor bread .\n\n \n\nGlutent is  say to be able  to hold gas by some people .\n\n\nThe Glutent can  retain the gas\ngiven out in fermentation and give spongy bread . \n \n\nAlso the Glutent ( storage protein ) can hold\nwater when  hydrated .\n\n\nIn Baking the  glutent  denature  to\ngive out for the starch  gelatinization .\n\n\nThe glutent  provide support to the dough before\nthe starch is gelatinized to take to the <unc> 1-word </unc> to\nmaintain the structure .\n\n\nThe Glutent film hold the gas and spongy structure and prevent the\ncollapse of bread .\n\n\nTherefore high storage protein can maintain the shape of the bread .\n\n \n\nThe storage protein affect the bread quality in the way mention\naboved .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "284c1374-86cc-4bbc-a579-844e19345515", "added":

{"text": "Heterogeneity of diabetes mellitus in the Hong Kong Chinese population .The Chinese University of Hong Kong-Price of Wales Hospital Diabetes Research\nand Care Group   \n\n\nJCN Chan   \n\n\nPrevalence of diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome \n\n\n \n\nTwo large-scale population-based epidemiological studies that used\nthe 1985 World Health Organization (  WHO ) diagnostic criteria for diabetes\nmellitus were performed in Hong Kong in 1990  1  and 1995.  2\n\n\n\nThe earlier study involved 1513 subjects who were recruited from two\nworkforces aged between 28 and 65 years .\n\n\nThe age-adjusted prevalence of diabetes mellitus was found to be\n7.7% , whereas the crude prevalence ranged from less than 1%\nin subjects younger than 30 years to more than 20% in the middle-aged\ngroup.  1 \n\n\nThe 1995 population-based survey involved 2900 subjects who were aged\nbetween 25 and 74 years , and showed an age-adjusted prevalence of\n8.5% .\n\n\nThe crude prevalence ranged from 1.7% in the 25-to-34-year\nage-group to more than 25% in those older than 65 years.  2 \n\n\nDue to different sampling methods , these figure are not directly\ncomparable; nevertheless , they support an overall rising trend in the\nage-adjusted prevalence of diabetes mellitus .\n\n\nIn both studies , only 30% of diabetes subjects had been\npreviously diagnosed .\n\n\nThe body mass index (  BMI ) , waist to hip ratio , a family history of\ndiabetes , and an older age were independent predicators of diabetes\nmellitus.  1,2 \n\n\nThere were also close associations between glucose intolerance ,\ndyslipidaemia (  high levels of triglyceride and low levels of high-density\nlipoprotein (  HDL]-cholesterol ) , obesity , hyperinsulinaemia , albuminuria ,\nand high blood pressure in these subjects.  3 \n\n\nThese findings suggest that diabetes mellitus in the Hong Kong\nChinese population is often part of a multifaceted syndrome , commonly known\nas the  ' metabloic syndrome'.  4 \n\n\nUsing statistical modeling , most of the components of the syndrome\ncan be explained by obesity , family history , and increased age.  4\n    \n\n\nPrevalence of impaired glucose tolerance   \n\n \n\nIndividuals have impaired glucose tolerance (  IGT ) if they fail\nto maintain a normal plasma glucose (  PG ) concentration 2 hours after a\nglucose load , but their PG levels do not reach values in the diabetic range\n( ie fasting PG , <7 mmol/L and 2-hour PG ,  7.8-11.1 mmol/ L ) .\n\n\nSimilar to the local trend in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus ,\nthe prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance (  IGT ) has increased markedly ,\nfrom 7% in both men and women in 1990  5  to 14% in\nmen and 17% in women in 1995.  2 \n\n\nAs with Caucasians,  6,7  Hong Kong Chinese people with ICT\nhave an increased number of cardio-vascular risk factor.  8,9 \n\n\nFor example , the prevalence of hypertension in 1990 was 7.5%\n, 23.9% , and 15% in Hong Kong Chinese men with normal\nglucose tolerance , IGT , and diabetes , respectively; in women , the\ncorresponding figures were 3.4% , 8.7% , 14%.  3\n\n\n\nRetinopathy  10  and albuminuria  3  have also been\nobserved in Chinese subjects with IGT .\n\n\nThree large-scale population-based studies of Caucasians have found\nclear relationships between the fasting PG level and mortality , even in non-\ndiabetic people.  11  \n\n \n\nIn a typical cohort of subjects with risk factors for diabetes\nmellitus (  usually a positive family history or a history of gestational\ndiabetes mellitus ) , 50% of those with IGT progressed to develop\ndiabetes mellitus in 4.34 years , giving a crude annual conversion rate of\n11.6%.  12 \n\n\nThe 2-hour post-glucose loading PG level was the major predicator of\nthe progression of glucose intolerance .\n\n\nFor those with a 2-hour PG level of = 10.1 mmol/L , the progression\nfrom IGT to diabetes mellitus was three times faster than for those with a\n2-hour PG level of <10.1 mmol/L.   12     \n\n\nPrevalence of obesity and its relationships with cardiovascular risk\nfactors   \n\n \n\nThe WHO defines overweight as a BMI between 25 and 29.9 kg/m \n2  , and obesity as a BMI of = 30 kg/m  2  in Caucasians. \n13 \n\n\nThe National Diabetes Data Group , however , defines obesity as a BMI\nof = 25 kg/m  2  in Caucasian women and = 27 kg/m  2  in\nmen.  14 \n\n\nBased on the WHO criteria , the prevalence of overweight in the Hong\nKong Chinese population increased from the 28% (  in 1990 ) to\n36% (  in 1995 ) and that of obesity from 3% to 6%.\n 1,2 \n\n\nIn the 1990 survey , however , the mean BMI of Hong Kong men and\nwomen of working age was 23 kg/m  2  , whereas the mean BMI of\ndiabetes individuals was 24 kg/m  2  .  1 \n\n\nHence , when the WHO definitions are applied to Asian populations ,\nwhose body frame are generally smaller than those of Caucasians , they are\noften erroneously considered to be non-obese.  15 \n\n\nThe International Obesity Task Force recently recommended the\nfollowing weight for Asians according to BMI value: overweight , = 23 kg/m\n 2  ; at-risk , 23 to 24.9 kg/m  2  ; obese I , 25 to 29.9\nkg/m  2  ; and obese II , > 30 kg/m  2  . \n\n \n\nDespite the differences in adiposity indices between Chinese and\nCaucasian populations , there are continuous relationships between\nanthropometric measurements-in particular , waist circumference-and\ncardiovascular risk factor in the Hong Kong Chinese population .\n\n\nThe threshold BMI value taken to indicate cardiovascular risk factors\nsuch as diabetes , hypertension , or dyslipidaemia has been shown to be\napproximately 24 kg/m  2  in both Hong Kong men and women.  16\n\n\n\nTaken together , the cardiovascular risks associated with blood\npressure , and blood lipid and blood glucose levels,  17  and\nobesity represent a continuum , and their interactions are more important tan\nabsolute values.  15,17-19    \n\n\nMortality and morbidity of type 2 diabetes  \n\n \n\nIn 1989 , we examined the clinical characteristics of 493\nconsecutive Hong Kong Chinese patients attending a hospital diabetes clinic.\n 20 \n\n\nLess than 3% of the patients had classical type 1 diabetes\nmellitus , defined as acute presentation with either diabetic ketoacidosis or\nheavy ketonuria (  > 3+ ) or continuous requirement of insulin within 1 year of\ndiagnosis .\n\n\nHowever , 25% of the patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus\nreceived insulin treatment .\n\n\nAmong the study population , 50% had hypertension ,\n50% had increased albuminuria , and 50% had dyslipidaemia .\n\n\nIn type 1 diabetes there are close relationships between hypertension\n, proteinuria , and retinopathy .\n\n\nHowever , these relationships are usually less consistent in the type\n2 disease .\n\n\nFor example , in Chinese with type 2 diabetes mellitus , 60%\nto 80% of patients with microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria had\nhypertension .\n\n\nHowever , 40% of the normalbuminuric patients also had\nhypertension thus suggesting that essential hypertension often coexists with\ntype 2 diabetes.  20 \n\n\nThese findings emphasise the heterogeneous nature in the clustering\nof these risk factors in Chinese patients . \n\n \n\nApproximately 30% of patients admitted to Hong Kong\npublic hospitals with stroke,  21,22  acute myocar-dial infarction,\n 23  and heart failure  24  in the early 1990s were found\nto also have diabetes mellitus .\n\n\nMany cases of diabetes were diagnosed only as the result of these\ndiabetic complications .\n\n\nUntil recently , 30% of diabetic patients showed clinical\nevidence of retinopathy when they were first referred to hospital .\n\n\nThe recent reduction of this figure to less than 10% in the\npast 2 to 3 years has been attributed to an increased awareness and earlier\nreferral of patients to hospital clinics.  25,26 \n\n\nBetween 30% and 40% of Hong Kong Chinese patients\nreceiving dialysis had diabetes during 1995 to 1999,  27  and many\nwere not enrolled into the renal replacement programme because of concurrent\nmedical problems such as visual loss or stroke .\n\n\nDespite receiving dialysis , these patients often have a reduced\nsurvival rate and poor quality of life .\n\n\nIn a 1990msurvey , drug-induced hypoglycaemia , mainly due to oral\ndrugs , was the main cause of hospital admissions to treat adverse drug\nevents .\n\n\nImpaired renal function and old age were the major predisposing\nfactors.  28  \n\n \n\nIn a local prospective study involving 400 type 2 diabetic\npatients followed up for a mean period of 26 months , the annual mortality\nrate was found to be 3.5% .\n\n\nThe majority of deaths were due to cardio-vascular disease (  mainly\nstroke ) and renal failure.  29 \n\n\nThe independent predicators of death were the fasting PG level and\nalbuminuria .\n\n\nIn this study , a spot urine albumin to creatinine ratio (  ACR ) of\n5.6 to 38.0 mg/mmol corresponded to a 24-hour urinary albumin excretion of 30\nto 30 mg/d .\n\n\nThese higher cut-off values might have been because of the lower body\nmass of the Hong Kong Chinese population .\n\n\nThe relative risk of death was 3.7 in patients with microalbuminuria\nand 11 in those with macroalbuminuria (  ACR = 38 mg/mmol ) when compared with\nthe normoalbuminuric patients .  29 \n\n\nIn another cohort of 102 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes\nmellitus who were followed up for a mean period of 5.5 year , 50% of\npatients with macro-albuminuria (  24-hour urinary albumin excretion , = 300\nmg/d on at least two occasions ) had at least one clinical end-point , which\nwas defined either as death , significant cardiovascular disease , or renal\nfailure.  30  \n\n \n\nThere are also close relationships between albuminuria and the\nrate of deterioration of renal function .\n\n\nBy using multivariate analysis , the fasting PG level , the glycated\nhaemoglobin HbA  lc  level , albuminuria , a high total cholesterol\nand low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol were found to be independent\npredicators of clinical events.  30 \n\n\nApart from the duration of disease , and metabolic and blood pressure\ncontrol , genetic factors have also been implicated in the development of\ndiabetic complications.  31 \n\n\nIn the Hong Kong Chinese population , the Z-2 allele-an (  AC )  n\n dinucleotide repeat upstream to the aldose reductcase gene-has been\nshown to be associated with severe retinopathy in young patients with type 2\ndiabetes mellitus.  32 \n\n\nThe angiotensinogen M235T (  TT ) genotype and its possible interaction\nwith the angiotensin converting enzyme deletion/insertion polymorphisms ( \nDI/DD ) have also been reported in Chinese diabetic patients who have\nincreased albuminuria.  33 \n\n\nHowever , these findings need to be reproduced in other patient\npopulations and their clinical significance requires prospective evaluation .\n  \n\n\nChildhood diabetes  \n\n \n\nIn Caucasians , autoimmune type 1 diabetes mellitus is the main\nform of diabetes in young patients and the diagnosis is unlikely to be missed .\n\n\nIn contrast , the type 1 disease remains uncommon in most\nnon-Caucasian population,  34  even among Chinese children or\npatients with a young onset of the disease (  younger than 35 years).  20\n\n\n\nEpidemiological studies performed in Hong Kong and mainland China\nhave revealed that there is a wide variation of incidence rates of type 1\ndiabetes within the Chinese population; the highest rate was found in Hong\nKong (  overall annual incidence , 2 per 100000).  35,36  \n\n \n\nThe incidence rate of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus in\nChinese children are increasing .\n\n\nCurrently , 10% to 15% of cases of childhood diabetes\nin Hong Kong are type 2 diabetes mellitus .\n\n\nMost of the young patients are adolescent with a strong family\nhistory of the disease (  G Wong , written communication , 2000 ) .\n\n\nThe high prevalence of childhood obesity (  > 120% of the\nreference mean of body weight for a certain height ) is 10% to\n14% in Hong Kong children,  37,38  and the incidence of type\n2 diabetes mellitus in adolescents and young adults is expected to increase\nfurther .   \n\n\nAutoimmune status in patients with young-or acute-onset diabetes\n \n\n \n\nIn 1990 , 28% of adults who attend the Prince of Wales\nHospital Diabetes Clinic were shown to have diabetes before the age of 35\nyears .\n\n\nAmong these patients , only 10% had classical type 1 diabetes\nmellitus , of which 50% received insulin treatment.  20 \n\n\nIn two separate cohorts of patients with either acute -  39 \nor early-onset diabetes,  40  antibodies to glutamic acid\ndecarboxylase (  GAD ) , a marker for autoimmunity , were found in only\n10% to 30% of patients , depending on the acuteness of their\nmodes of presentation and insulin secretory status .\n\n\nPatients with an earlier onset of disease also tended to have a\nhigher detection rate of anti-GAD antibodies .\n\n\nThese findings suggest that although autoimmune destruction of \u00df\ncells remains a rare event in the local population , it may adopt a more\nimportant role in patients with early-onset disease .\n\n\nA similar form of slow-onset autoimmune diabetes has also been\nreported in Caucasians.  41  \n\n \n\nIn patients with type 1 presentation , there was also\nheterogeneity of pancreatic \u00df-cell function: only 75% of patients\nwere classified as being truly insulin deficient,  39  as determined\nby either basal (  <0.2 nmol/L )   42  or post-glucagon-stimulated\nplasma C-peptide levels (  <0/6 nmol/L).   43 \n\n\nDespite presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis , some patients no\nlonger required insulin at a later stage .\n\n\nAlthough these patients did not have antibodies against GAD , they\nhad severe to moderate insulin deficiency , based on C-peptide level , which\nsuggests that they may eventually require insulin treatment.  44,45 \n\n\nA similar form of diabetes , sometimes known as'type 1 1/2 ' or  ' flatbush\ndiabetes ' has also been described in African Americans.  46 \n\n\nThe acute presentation in these patients might be related to the\neffects of severe hyperglycaemia on insulin resistance and pancreatic \u00df-cell\nfunction .\n\n\nOur findings suggest that , as with childhood type 1 diabetes\nmellitus , both acute-and young-onset diabetes in the Hong Kong Chinese\npopulation are heterogeneous conditions in which autoimmunity remains an\nuncommon cause . \n\n \n\nIn our 1990 survey , we reported that younger patients had a\nhigher prevalence of a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity\nthan patients whose disease started later in life.  20 \n\n\nSince 1995 , all patients attending the Prince of Wales Hospital\nDiabetes Clinic undergo comprehensive assessment modified from the Europe\nDiabCare protocol.  47 \n\n\nIn 1997 , the database consisted of more than 3000 patients ,\n28% of whom were diagnosed whom were diagnosed before the age of 35\nyears at the time of assessment .\n\n\nAmong these young patients , 56% had a family history of\ndiabetes , compared with 45% in the older-onset group.  48 \n\n\nIn addition , 1% of these index patient had members of three\nsuccessive generations affected by diabetes .\n\n\nIn agreement with reports in other populations , patients who had a\npositive family history of diabetes were more likely to have a maternal\nhistory of the disease.  49,50 \n\n\nThese findings emphasise the importance of genetic factors ,\nespecially inpatients with a young onset of disease .   \n\n\nGenetic heterogeneity of patients with maturity-onset diabetes of\nyouth  \n\n \n\nOur findings suggest that some young patients in Hong Kong might\nhave maturity-onset diabetes of youth (  MODY),  51  which is a\nmongenic form of diabetes that is characterised by autosomal dominant\ninheritance , early onset (  usually before 25 years of age ) , and a primary\ndefect in pancreatic \u00df-cell function .\n\n\nThis form of diabetes can result from mutations in at least five\ndifferent genes-namely , those encoding glucokinase; the hepatocyte nuclear\nfactors , HNF-1a , HNF-1\u00df , and HNF-4a; and insulin promoter factor 1 ( \nIPF-1).  52-56  \n\n \n\nIn a cohort of 92 unrelated Chinese patients with the familiar\nform of early-onset type 2 diabetes , direct sequencing revealed mutations\nin the genes encoding glucokinase and the transcription factor HNF-1a genes\nin three (  3% ) and five (  5% ) patients , respectively .\n\n\nNo mutations were found in the coding region of the HNF-4a gene .\n\n\nThe three mutations found in the glucokinase gene were novel missense\nmutations that corresponded to amino acid changes I110T , A119D , and G385V .\n\n\nThe mutations found in the HNF-1a gene also represented new\nmutations and included four missense mutations (  G20R , R203 , S432C , and\nI618M ) and one splice acceptor site mutation (  IVS2nt-IG?A ) .\n\n\nDespite the cosegregation of mutations with diabetes in one of these\nfamilies , two siblings presented with severe complications due to delayed\ndiagnosis while the other two siblings (  who had need diagnosed by screening)\nremained free of complications after 10 years of disease.  57-59 \n\n\n \n\nAmong a cohort of 150 young patients with a family history of\ndiabetes , 3% had an A?G mutation in the mitochondrial DNA encoding\ntRNA  Leu(UUR )  at position 3243 and 2% had an A?G mutation\nin the amylin gene .\n\n\nIn addition , antibodies to GAD were present in 4% of the\nyoung patients.  60 \n\n\nThe presence of these gene mutations and autoimmune markers is\nassociated with a reduced insulin secretion and is likely to have contributed\nto MODY either directly or indirectly by gene-gene or gene-environmental\ninteractions (  Fig 1 ) . \n\n \n\nThe role of genetic factors in causing diabetes in young\npatients is further highlighted by the increased heritability of diabetes\nmellitus among their family members .\n\n\nAll but two if the 55 families screened so fat had at least one\nother affected family member .\n\n\nAmong the 200 family members of patients with young onset of disease\n, approximately 40% had PG either in the diabetic or IGT range during\na 75-g oral glucose tolerance test .\n\n\nThe majority of cases , however , had not been diagnosed previously .\n\n\nThis figure compares with a 1% to 2% prevalence of\ndiabetes in a random population of similar age.  2 \n\n\nFurthermore , 90% of the parents of the index patients who\nunderwent formal oral glucose tolerance testing were found to have diabetes\nmellitus .\n\n\nThis figure compares with a prevalence of 20% to 25%\nin a random population aged 60 years or older.  61    \n\n\nObesity in young-onset diabetic patients  \n\n \n\nObesity affects 50% of young diabetic patients in Hong\nKong.  20 \n\n\nCompared with patients who had antibodies to GAD , those who did not\nwere more obese , had a higher blood pressure , higher triglyceride levels ,\nlower HDI-cholesterol levels , and increased albuminuria .\n\n\nThese findings suggest that the metabolic syndrome \nmay have an earlier presentation in young patients in Hong Kong  40 \nand corroborate the rising prevalence of childhood obesity in the local\npopulation.  37,38  \n\n \n\nObesity is a multifactorial disease that involves genetic ,\nenvironmental , hormonal , and cultural factors .\n\n\nThere are complex hormonal interactions in the regulation of food\nintake , energy expenditure , and fat deposition.  15 \n\n\nIn this respect , it has been hypothesised that a reduced level of\ngrowth hormone (  partly due to physical inactivity ) , changes in sex hormones\n, and stress-related hypercortisolaemia may enhance the deposition of\nvisceral adipocytes .\n\n\nThe latter have increased lipolytic activities in response to\ncatecholamines .\n\n\nIncreased production of free fatty acids can in turn lead to insulin\nresistance and reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (  Fig 2). \n4,62 \n\n\nAgainst this background , 51% of the variance in waist\ncircumstance in young Hong Kong Chinese patients can be explained by a\nreduced secretion of growth hormone and increased cortisol , and insulin\nlevels.  63 \n\n\nWe are currently exploring the interactions between these hormonal\nfactors and other candidate genes for obesity in these young patients . \n  \n\n\nThe importance of quality care of diabetic patients  \n\n \n\nDiabetes mellitus-particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus , which\naccounts for 97% of all cases of diabetes-is a missive public health\nproblem that has major socio-economic implications.  64 \n\n\nAccording to the WHO , rapid changes in lifestyles and\nsocio-economic developments in Asia will cause major increases in the\nprevalence of diabetes in mainland China and India.  65 \n\n\nIt is established that 18 million people in China have diabetes\nmellitus and that 50% of cases will remain undiagnosed .\n\n\nThe figure is expected to increase to 34 million in 2025 and will\noccur mainly in the 40- to 50-year age-group.  65  \n\n \n\nThe effective management of diabetes depends on a holistic and\nmultidisciplinary approach that emphasizes prevention and patient education .\n\n\nOwing to the complexity and chronicity of diabetes , a structured\ndisease management programme that uses periodic assessments , evidence-based\nmedicine to achieve treatment target , and patient empowerment is necessary\nto ensure the quality of diabetes care .\n\n\nTo maximise the efficient use of finite health care resources ,\nthere is an increasing trend for patients with chronic disease such as\ndiabetes to be discharged to the community using a  ' shared care ' model. \n66 \n\n\nUnder this scheme , carefully selected patients who are discharged\nto community clinics are followed up according to a protocol designed by both\nspecialists and community doctor .\n\n\nSince the implementation of the shared care model in the Prince of\nWales Hospital in 1995 , more than 1000 patients have returned to the\ncommunity .\n\n\nThe majority of patients who have returned for reassessment had\nstable metabolic and blood pressure control .\n\n\nMore than 80% of these patients were satisfied with this\nmodel of care and showed good knowledge about the disease and its management.\n 67  \n\n \n\nBecause only a small proportion of diabetes patients in Hong\nKong has access to shared care , many cases of diabetes will remain\nundiagnosed , untreated , or suboptimally treated .\n\n\nThere is a need for structural changes within the health care system\nand increased awareness of diabetes among both the general public and health\ncare professionals .\n\n\nIncreased training opportunities for dedicated health care providers\nin diabetes education and management are also urgently needed if quality and\naffordable diabetes care is to become easily and widely available .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

!\n\n\nWhat kind of job is it ?\n\n\nDo you work only on Saturdays and Sundays ?\n\n\nHow is the pay ?\n\n\nIs it attractive ?\n\n\nPreviously , you gave private piano lessons to some Japanese ,  you teach piano now ?\n\n\nAs in Hong Kong , the tuition fees for learning piano has increased\ntremendously but it  ' s not the case of private tuition .\n\n\nFor learning piano , one has to pay two hundred dollars per hour but\nfor private tuition , it  ' s only around one hundred or a little more .\n\n\nSo , I prefer teaching piano rather than giving private tuition to\nsecondary school students .\n\n\nJanet , if you come back to Hong Kong in June , you can earn quite a\nlot within your summer holidays as you can teach piano !\n\n\nBut if you come back in July , you can't earn much and most important\nof all , you can't see me !\n\n\nIt  ' s a pity !\n\n\nPlease do return back in June rather than July .\n\n\nIn July , I am going to France to learn French .\n\n\nAlthough I have learnt French for two years , the standard is really\nlow .\n\n\nI still have problem to speak in French when communicating with my\nFrench classmates and my French pen friend .\n\n\nI choose to go to France to study French because I  ' d like to meet\nher .\n\n\nOtherwise , I  ' d choose Canada as I  ' ve many relatives living there .\n\n\nHow about you ?\n\n\nDo you still keep in touch with your German pen-friend ?\n\n\nDo you remember that in Form three , Miss Lee persuaded us to have a\npen friend so as to improve our English ?\n\n\nBut now you don't need this , right ?\n\n\nI think you must have many western friends already ! ! \n\n \n\nJanet , I have so many news to tell you !\n\n\nAt this moment , I  ' m having Easter holidays but only last for five\ndays .\n\n\nDuring the holidays , I went to Macau with my relatives\n\n\nof course , we went to the Casino .\n\n\nAll of us lost money in the Casino !\n\n\nPoor us ! \n\n \n\nMy sister Wendy did not go to South Africa but she decides to go\nthere in the summer holiday .\n\n\nTherefore , Janet , if you come back in July , it  ' s a bit late\nbecause my sister and I are not in HK at that time !\n\n\nAre you studying the third year at the university ?\n\n\nThen , what are you going to do after graduation ?\n\n\nFor me , I don't have any exact plan yet because it  ' s not so easy to\nfind a job with reasonable salary .\n\n\nThe average salary is only around &dollar;8000 , it  ' s much lower\nthan a salesgirl in a large boutique or a waitress in a restaurant !\n\n\nThis phenomenon is really odd !\n\n\nSometimes , I regret for what I have chosen .\n\n\nRita also regrets at this moment , she only applies the job of\nAssistant Education Officer of the Education Department !\n\n\nShe is not going to travel Europe as she  ' s very worried to find a\njob ! ! ! \n\n\nI have gone through many recruitment tests but all of them were in\nvain . \n\n \n\nThe tests are really difficult .\n\n\nThey cover the questions of IQ , Maths , grammar , sentence\nstructures , ... etc .\n\n\nAs you know , I haven't done any Maths exercises for five years ,\neven the formula of finding the area of a circle is a big difficulty for me !\n\n\nI have no hope to find a good job , maybe , being a teacher will be\nmy career in my life . \n\n \n\nI  ' ve talked too much , right ?\n\n\nBut I  ' ve to ask you something about your suitor the Taiwanese , is\nhe a lecturer at your University ?\n\n\nHe has the ability to buy Hyatt Hawaii at the age of twenty\nsomething ?\n\n\nIt  ' s really unbelievable ! !\n\n\nI think you like him , don't you ?\n\n\nYou are lucky to meet such a guy who is rich , handsome ,\nso-well-educated , young , ........ let me know if you are both going to\nmarry ! ! ! \n\n \n\nLastly , I  ' d like to tell you that Mr. Lee has opened a \"\nG2000 &rdquo; in Tsuen Wan ,\n\n\nhe gives me 20% discount for any purchase !\n\n\nHe also remembers you ,\n\n\nif you come back , let  ' s visit him and buy something at his shop .\n\n\nHe did not teach anymore in  because he  ' d like to\nbe a  businessman  ha ha !\n\n\nHe told me that he would open another G2000 in the New Territories .\n\n\nI wonder why he studied Master Degree if he determined to be a\nbusinessman rather than a teacher .\n\n\nAlthough his wife has obtained a BBA degree at Chinese University ,\nshe did not teach anymore .\n\n\nIt  ' s ... so strange ! ? \n\n \n\nI  ' ve to stop now and I hope you can reply as soon as possible .\n\n\nI  ' m going to have exam on 4 May to 16 May and I  ' ve reserved an air\nticket to France ( AIR FRANCE ) on 26 June .\n\n\nIt  ' s direct flight because my parents are worried about my trip !\n\n\nThey are so anxious !\n\n\nI plan to be back in mid-August . \n\n\nHope to see you soon !\n\n\nLove,\n\n\nAmy\n\n\n3/19/94 \n\n\n\n\nDearest Pamela,\n\n \n\nHello !\n\n\nThis is Amy again .\n\n\nI  ' m so glad that you reply my letter .\n\n\nNow , let me tell you my news . \n\n \n\nI received a letter from a Government department .\n\n\nThey ask me to sit for a recruitment test of the post \"   Liaison  Officer &rdquo; .\n\n\nI like this job very much because the salary is attractive , the\nduty is simple , just do the co-ordinating work within various government\ndepartments .\n\n\nSo I hope I can pass the test on 31 March . \n\n \n\nMy trip to France is annoying because it  ' s difficult to\ncompromise with my classmates .\n\n\nWe cannot agree on the routes .\n\n\nIt  ' s probably that I  ' ll go to France alone and stay in Paris for a\nfew days (  alone  ! ! )\n\n\nTherefore , I try to find out information about Paris during these\nfew days . I hope I  ' ll be safe there !\n\n\nGod Bless Me !\n\n\nI  ' ve been learning French for two years .\n\n\nBut the standard is really bad .\n\n\nThat  ' s why I join the trip . \n\n \n\nI hardly see Aunt Maria , Alma ,  Lorraine , Sze\n, Kit ..... etc because they  ' re all busy with their work .\n\n\nKit and Lorraine takes the public exam this year . \n\n \n\nOn 10 April , I  ' ll have French oral exam but I don't have much\nconfidence .\n\n\nEven my spoken English is a problem !\n\n\nFrom then on , my graduation exams begin until 16 May .\n\n\nThe exam is quite tightly packed .\n\n\nI hope I can survive after the exam .\n\n\nI  ' ll lose weight after the exam .\n\n\nIt  ' s true ! \n\n\nI don't have much more news .\n\n\nWrite back soon .\n\n\nLove ,\n\n\nAmy\n\n\n94\n\n\nPS : Pls . say my regards to Yvette , Auntie , Uncle &plus; grandma\n\n\n\n\n\nDearest Kate ,\n\n \n\nHello !\n\n\nHow are you ?\n\n\nI am extremely busy at HKU. because the workload is heavy !\n\n\nMaybe this is my final year ,\n\n\nthere are many essays for me to do .\n\n\nHow about you in the University of Leeds ?\n\n\nAre you studying in the second year ? \n\n \n\nI recall that last week was your birthday ,\n\n\nhow do you celebrate ?\n\n\nIn may , I  ' ll finish my exams .\n\n\nAnd in late June , I  ' ll go to France to study French .\n\n\nAt first , I plan to leave France on mid-August but I  ' d like to ask\nyou that is it possible for me to meet you in London if I change my place of\ndeparture .\n\n\nThat is , I leave at London Airport rather than the airport in Paris .\n\n\nI want to see you after writing to you for eight years ,\n\n\nif it  ' s possible then can you take me travel around .\n\n\nI won't stay in London very long , maybe 1/2 day because it depends\non your decision .\n\n\nIf you can meet me and stay with you , I can stay in  come to\nBritain\n\n\nPlease let me know whether you can meet me at the &lsquo; Dover\n&rsquo; pier / London Airport .\n\n\nAlso , can you give me your telephone number .\n\n\nI really want to meet you ,\n\n\nif you are busy , then can we meet just several hours ?\n\n\nSeveral hours also make me very pleased then . \n\n\nNow , I give you my telephone number 7441251.\n\n\nYou can phone me if you have any inquires about my trip.\n\n\nI hope that I can receive your reply as soon as possible maybe early\nApril .\n\n\nThis is really urgent and I  ' m looking for your favourite replies.\n\n\nLove ,\n\n\nAmy\n\n\n94 \n\n\n\n\n25-5-93\n\n\nDear Isabelle ,\n\n \n\nHow are you ?\n\n\nI am very happy now because my exam was over . \n\n\nHave your school exam started yet ? \n\n \n\nIt had been a tough time to me because I was very lazy and did\nnot do much revision .\n\n\nTherefore , before the exam came , I had to study very very hard to\ncover what I had learned in the whole year .\n\n\nI hope I will get  good result . \n\n \n\n I am now working in the Hong Kong\nSports Development Board as a summer helper .\n\n\nMy job duties are to extract minutes , arrange time schedule and\nassign jobs for the messengers .\n\n\nIt is indeed a very boring job .\n\n\nLuckily , the employees there are very nice and friendly .\n\n\nand I am <del> ve <del> happy to work &plus; play with them . \n\n\nWhen will your summer holiday start ?\n\n\nHow do you plan to spend it ?\n\n\nPlease  tell me next time.\n\n\nTime to stop .\n\n\nBye Bye !\n\n\nAlvina Liu \n\n\n\n\n4-7-93\n\n\nDear Isabelle ,\n\n \n\nHello ! ! \n\n\nHow are you getting on ?\n\n\nI am having a wonderful time in Hong Kong . \n\n \n\nIt is now July and July and Autumn are the two hottest months in\nHong Kong .\n\n\n The temperature always reaches or even  more than 30&degree;C .\n\n\nPeople wear very thin clothes and when you walk in the streets , you\nwill think  you are having sauna !\n\n\nAnyway , I believe summer is the most favourite season for the men\nin Hong Kong because there are many women who wear little and they are very\nsexy ! !  \n\n \n\nI go to swim every Sunday .\n\n\nAlthough the swimming pool is very crowded , I enjoy the feeling in\nwater .\n\n\nSometimes I go with my friends but sometimes I go alone .\n\n\nAlthough I love swimming , I do not excel in it . \n\n\n Will you go to other countries in this summer\nholiday ?\n\n\nI won't because my contract ends on 31st Aug .\n\n\nTime to stop .\n\n\nBye Bye ! ! \n\n\nAlvina Liu \n\n\n\n\nDear Isabelle ,\n\n\nMerry Christmas !\n\n\nI hope you like my Christmas card .\n\n \n\nI am having my term break .\n\n\nand so I don't have to go to school until January .\n\n\nI spend most of my time sleeping because I feel extremely tired\nafter the 1st semester .\n\n\nI also go to see movies and drama.\n\n\nDrama is beginning to gain popularity in Hong Kong and the tickets\nare always sold out .\n\n\nThus , you have to be quick to go to buy tickets .\n\n\nThe fare is reasonable and  students and the elderly\nhave discount .\n\n\n sometimes up to 50% ! \n\n \n\nMost of the shops are on sale now .\n\n\nAnd they are jammed with people looking for low-priced clothes and\nshoes .\n\n\nIs it the same in France ?\n\n\nI have  bought many shirts because the price is\nreasonable now .\n\n\nWhen the shops are not on sale , they always mark up the price  very high .\n\n\nTherefore , I seldom buy in this time because I  have the feeling that I am cheated ! \n\n\nI hope you enjoy your Christmas and have a Happy New Year ! ! \n\n\nAlvina Liu\n\n\nX'mas 93", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f15ec4f0-92b4-4d8f-ad84-963d4ef71fc5", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.843107+00:00"}
{"text": "The prospect of mediation in resolving construction disputes\n \n\n \n\nMediation , which is considered to be one of the most effective\nmeans of resolving disputes , is now being used to a large extent around the\nworld .\n\n\nIt is found to function perfectly well for many types of disputes .\n\n\nSpecific success has been recorded in such areas of disputes as trade\n, construction , purchasing and supply , banking , insurance , personal\ninjury, partnership , consumer , maritime , divorce and family matters . \n\n \n\nParties from the Far East , in virtue of their customs and\ntraditions , are much in favour of and advocate the two-tier system of\nmediation and , should it not succeed, arbitration .\n\n\nIn other countries as well , such as South Africa , New Zealand ,\nGermany and the United States, to name a few , mediation is nowadays\nattempted as an alternative way of dispute resolution .\n\n\nAdditionally , it is generating considerable interest in the United\nKingdom as revealed by the recent discussions on this hot issue in the\nleading arbitration journals . \n\n \n\nOn the whole , the parties having employed this mode of dispute\nresolution responded favorably in their attendant evaluations , specifically\nabout its fairness and capability to effect an expeditious accommodation at\nlow cost .\n\n\nReported success rates in mediation have been claimed to be over\n80% .  \n\n\nThe demand for change in Hong Kong \n\n \n\nThe usual procedure for resolving disputes in the construction\nindustry of Hong Kong has been the incorporation of an arbitration clause in\nthe conditions of contract rather than referring to litigation .\n\n\nThis approach has the advantage that the appointment of the\narbitrator as well as the conduct of the arbitration are under the auspices\nof the parties . \n\n \n\nUnfortunately , in these two decades , the arbitration process\nhas become increasingly complex coupled with protracted duration and\nspiralling costs , prompting moves towards the exploration of an alternative\nmode of disputes resolution which should be both inexpensive , expeditious\nand efficacious .\n\n\nIndeed , arbitration , by its very nature , is inherent with the\nadversarial approach to resolution of disagreements and it is this respect\nwhich generally mirrors litigation .\n\n\nThe confrontation involved , with little possibility of communication\nand cooperation , is not unfrequently at the expense of goodwill between the\nparties and the on-going harmonious business relationship .\n\n\nAs such , arbitration is very often considered as dragging the\nparties into battle which contributes nothing for continuing commercial\nrelationships . \n\n \n\nMoreover , the usual conditions of contract , whether in the\ngovernment forms or those for the private sector , preclude reference to\narbitration prior to the completion of the construction work .\n\n\nHence , even disputes of a very minor nature incurring early in a\ncontract can cause tension or even damage to the relationship between\ncontractor and employer and , in turn , evoke further disputes and contract\ndelays .\n\n\nIn this respect , the employment of a truly independent mediator , as\nopposed to the \" Engineer &rdquo; or the \" Architect &rdquo; in\nthe contract whose status was claimed to have been increasingly eroded\nrecently , would give an immediate and quick decision or judgment on any\ndisputes that arise, which if either party disagreed , could later be\nchallenged through arbitration . \n\n \n\nBesides , litigators , often appointed as arbitrators , are\ntrained up and are used to adversarial proceedings where they are able to\nexercise their wit or gamesmanship by reference to the legal rules .\n\n\nHowever , laymen in the construction field do not perceive any\nadvantages to employ this mode of disagreement settlement in their cases and\nthe prevailing tendency is against acute adversarial ways of resolving\ndisputes .\n\n\nIn response to dissatisfaction from the involved parties ,\ntraditional approaches to the conduct of arbitration , which in general\nfollows the court procedure , are being modified.\n\n\nHence the recent proneness in the development of the dispute\nresolution alternatives can be considered as one form of evolution of modern\ncommercial arbitration . \n\n \n\nIt is well recognized that in the construction industry the\nsuccess of a project originates from cooperation and not confrontation\nbetween the promoter and the contractor .\n\n\nIt is believed that the internal cohesion within the relatively\nself-contained or isolated construction activities will be impaired if\nadversarial proceedings are employed to settle disputes .\n\n\nThus the overwhelming lay disenchantment with the adversarial system\nof justice cannot be over-emphasized .\n\n\nA firm credence is held that discords ought to be settled within the\nindustry itself by processes of dialogues and , as a matter of course , not\nby any confrontational means .\n\n\nAs such, mediation as a means of resolving disagreements is\nintuitively preferred .\n\n\nOver and above , it can be considered as a response to the discerned\ninsufficiencies of commercial arbitration as a dispute settlement process .\n\n\n \n\nBased on the above premises , the Hong Kong Construction\nAssociation and the Association of Consulting Engineers have imparted strong\nbacking to the mediation notion and advocated it to the Hong Kong Government\nwhich is found to be highly receptive .\n\n\nBoth the consultants and the contractors in the construction field\nwere proved to welcome the concept whole-heartedly , other references . \n\n \n\nThe importance of the suitability of the mediator candidature who\nshould be free from any possible conflict of interest and should possess the\ntechnical expertise to the subject matters cannot be overemphasized .\n\n\nEvidently , the more eminent the mediator , and the better reasoned\nhis opinion , the higher the possibility of it being accepted by both parties .\n\n\nThroughout the mediation it is imperative that the mediator must be\nconceived to be neutral , which maintains the confidence of both parties .\n\n\nIn addition , mediators , whose tasks comprise shuttle diplomacy ,\nshould possess personal and social tacts specially identified with mediation\nas a non-adversarial method of settling disagreements .  \n\n\nPros and cons of mediation \n\n \n\nWhilst mediation is usually relatively expeditious and\ninexpensive in costs , arbitration can be lengthy, time-consuming and\nexpensive and hence mediation normally costs a fraction of arbitration .\n\n\nIt stems primarily from the usual exclusion of the access to legal\nrepresentation of the parties in mediation , although they are not precluded\nfrom procuring legal advice .\n\n\nIn arbitration, the parties are often represented by lawyers , being\nclaimed to effect the bulk of procrastination and additional expenditure .\n\n\nThe employment of competent lay advocates in mediation should achieve\nsubstantial savings since , being technical , they are better able to adjudge\nand do away with irrelevant matters and associated paperwork .\n\n\nHence , rather than millions of dollars , the mediation process ,\neven for complex situations , should only run to hundreds of thousands of\ndollars . \n\n \n\nThe resolution of a dispute with the aid of a mediator clearly\nholds greater chance for an on-going business relationship between the\nparties and the likelihood of mutual satisfaction with the outcome is\nenhanced .\n\n\nThis is in contrast to the case for arbitration or litigation where\nthe award may leave one , or both , of the parties feeling aggrieved with\nlittle prospect of the business relationship continuing .\n\n\nMediation conduces to alleviate hostilities by fostering cooperation\nthrough a structured way .\n\n\nOn the contrary, arbitration is apt to highlight alienation and\naggravates the resentment of the parties .\n\n\nThe sense of competence attained in the mediation process is an\nessential by-product that aids in furnishing self-direction and in mitigating\nthe propensity for the parties to carry on the battle . \n\n \n\nOne of the greatest disadvantages to mediation is probably the\nlack of finality in its enforcement .\n\n\nThe mediator  ' s opinion is only persuasive and either party may elect\nnot to follow it and may proceed to arbitration under the provision of the\nconstruction contract .\n\n\nHowever , since mediation is purely voluntary and everyone who\nundertakes oneself may of course also be expected to honour the ensuing\nagreement .\n\n\nBesides , as an expert on the subject matter in dispute , the\nmediator  ' s opinion will , of course , deserve respect and be difficult to be\ndisregarded .\n\n\nIn fact , it is the mediator  ' s responsibility to ensure that his\nopinion must be sufficiently convincing and logically sound .\n\n\nIt is hoped that the parties , having had an independent assessment ,\nwould take the view that , were they proceed to arbitration , a similar\ndecision would most likely come up and hence there is no benefit in\nchallenging it .\n\n\nAlthough the opinion is not binding , at least the parties are placed\nin a better position to consider whether or not to proceed to arbitration .\n\n\n \n\nEven if the mediator is unable to persuade the parties to reach a\nconsensual accommodation and the dispute proceeds to arbitration , the\nmitigation of hostility , by advocating direct dialogues between the parties\nthrough this process , paves the way for the permanence of an accommodation .\n\n\nIt naturally keeps down the possibility that a controversial\nproceeding will persist beyond itself.\n\n\nThe costs involved in the preparation would not be entirely lost as\nthe information gleaned together could be used in the subsequent arbitration .\n\n\nAs such , mediation normally narrows the issues in dispute and so\nshortens the time and cost of any subsequent arbitration . \n\n \n\nOne advantage of mediation is that flexibility exists to withdraw\nfrom it should one party be dissatisfied with the attitudes adopted by or the\nstyle of the mediator .\n\n\nIn such circumstances , the recommendations of the mediator can be\ndisregarded .\n\n\nFrom this point of view, lack of finality can be considered as an\nattraction of mediation since it allows the parties objectively to value the\npersonal qualities of the mediator and the weight to attach to his\nrecommendations , in determining whether or not to observe his opinion or\nproceed to arbitration.\n\n\nBesides , in an arbitration , a party may be reluctant to elucidate\nand depict some related background information fully .\n\n\nIt is certainly not as open and unreserved as he might be willing to\naccomplish in mediation proceedings by virtue of its distinct characteristics\nof confidentiality . \n\n \n\nBoth the premises for mediation as an alternative way to the\nconfrontation process and the effect of mediated agreement render it a\npromising process against the adversarial methods .\n\n\nMediation can enlighten the parties about the other  ' s demands and\nfurnish a peculiar model for resolving any prospective disagreements .\n\n\nIt can thus assist them to recognize working collaboratively ,\nisolate the subject matters and appreciate the significance of cooperation .\n\n\nMediation offers this advantage due to the fact that it is not\nstrictly bound by the rules of procedure and substantive law which dominate\nthe adversary methods .\n\n\nThe mediator is not which was claimed to be all in all a progressing\ndevelopment in the industry .  \n\n\nImplementation in public construction sector \n\n \n\nThe Hong Kong Government , having recognized that arbitration can\nfrequently be very expensive and time-consuming , has implemented mediation\non a trial and selected basis since 1984 , adopting a mediation procedure\nformulated in consultation with the construction industry and the associated\nprofessions .\n\n\nOwing to the marked successfulness of the trial scheme , in 1989 the\ngovernment determined to incorporate a clause to formalize mediation , which\nis effected by the promulgation of Lands and Works Branch Technical Circular\nNo. 8/89 on administration guidelines for mediation in construction disputes\n, in all Group B building and civil engineering contracts and above (\ni.e. all larger contracts ) , and all electrical , mechanical and\nbuilding services contracts of equivalent value , as an alternative means of\nresolving construction disputes to arbitration. The Hong Kong Government Hong\nKong Institution of Engineers Mediation Service Rules , as it is currently in\nforce , has also been evolved in the light of experience . \n\n \n\nUnder the captioned Mediation Service Rules , the Hong Kong\nInstitution of Engineers ( HKIE ) , as an appropriate and\nimpartial third party , will undertake the administration of the mediation\nprocedure .\n\n\nMediation can be requested by either party at any time during the\nconstruction process .\n\n\nParties to a disagreement will direct their requests for mediation\nthrough the HKIE .\n\n\nIf the parties themselves are not able to agree on the same mediator\n, the HKIE will appoint an appropriate person after having consultation with\nother professional bodies involved in the construction industry . \n\n \n\nThe right of the parties to litigation or arbitration will not be\naffected by the reference to mediation .\n\n\nIn spite of the introduction of mediation into the standard forms of\ncontracts , both parties are not compelled to follow the course and are\nallowed to have recourse directly to arbitration .\n\n\nUnless all parties concerned have indicated willingness to\nparticipate , mediation will not be initiated .  \n\n\nThe mediation process \n\n \n\nMediation is not a legal procedure but is a process within an\ninformal yet structured framework , whereby a dispute is referred to a third\nperson , who hears and analyses the facts and arguments , formulates his\nopinion on the respective merits , and endeavours to arrive at a compromising\nand mutually acceptable accommodation .\n\n\nIt , being a non-adversarial alternative method of dispute resolution\n, seeks to encourage the parties to communicate , appreciate and evaluate\neach other  ' s viewpoints and come up with a settlement with one accord .\n\n\nIn this regard , the mediator concentrates on the factual background\nand attempts to create an atmosphere for the parties to resolve their\ndisagreement with the appropriate financial implications instead of ordering\nan award or judgment unilaterally .\n\n\nIt must be stressed that the parties are not obliged to accept the\nmediator  ' s opinion , which is not legally binding . \n\n \n\nThe most significant difference between mediation and arbitration\nis in the approach adopted in the respective processes , namely ,\nnon-adversarial in mediation and adversarial in arbitration .\n\n\nMediation is also differentiated from conciliation by the more active\ndegree of involvement of the mediator than the respective conciliator.\n\n\nThus mediation can be considered as half-way between conciliation and\narbitration . \n\n \n\nThe aim of mediation is to attain an expeditious solution to a\ndispute at minimum cost .\n\n\nUnder the HKIE mediation system , the mediator is anticipated to\nendeavour and conclude the whole process within 42 days and , for a complex\ncase , not more than three months unless agreed otherwise . \n\n \n\nIn conducting the proceedings , a mediator is allowed higher\nflexibility than an arbitrator .\n\n\nHe may have preparatory discussions with one party only .\n\n\nHe is entitled to abstain from conveying some materials known from\none party to the other .\n\n\nIn arbitration , any communications between the arbitrator and one of\nthe parties in the absence of the other party would lead to misconduct and\ncould probably result in his award being set aside or even to his removal .\n\n\n \n\nThe costs are normally borne in equal share by the parties except\nin special circumstances where full costs may be ordered against a party who\nvexatiously initiated the dispute .\n\n\nThe procedures remain private and confidential and are not subject to\ndisclosure or being introduced as evidence in any subsequent proceedings\nalthough mediation is not a formal legal procedure . \n\n \n\nThe conclusions will only be recorded in open correspondence by\nthe HKIE , if and only if the mediation is successful .  \n\n\nPre-requisites for mediation \n\n \n\nFor a disagreement to be settled by mediation , the possession of\nsingle mind to cooperate on the part of each party is one of the most\nsignificant pre-requisites.\n\n\nIt is clearly essential that both parties are ready and willing to\ndiscuss the matters in dispute .\n\n\nThey must be aware that every disagreement will be resolved\neventually and that settlement by agreement always costs less in both\nmonetary and time domains than settlement by bound by the terms of the\ncontract , giving flexibility to reach an agreeable solution .\n\n\nThe final jurisdiction in mediation is incumbent upon the parties\nthemselves, and they may fashion-make a particular form of solution for\nthemselves under no influence of precedent cases in common law .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a3b3ed35-09b5-496c-a94f-c84d90ba12a6", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.844593+00:00"}

\n\n \n\nI spend my weekends in doing housework and my homework .\n\n\nHouseworks include washing dishes , clothes , sweeping dust ,\ncleaning upstair carpet , etc ...\n\n\nI don't know why I  ' ve so many homeworks .\n\n\nFor Math , I have 60 questions each week .\n\n\nFor Eng , I  ' ve to do a project on studying novels and research for a\ntopic .\n\n\nEach student is assigned different topic .\n\n\nMy topic is Ecology this time .\n\n\nIf you have any materials about my topic , such as articles ,\nmagazines , would you please send them to me ?\n\n\nIf not , just forget it .\n\n\nFor Music , I  ' ve to complete 2 projects within 4 months .\n\n\nAbout tests and exams , each subject has at least a test each week .\n\n\nFor Math , the highest record is that I had a chapter test on Monday\nand I had an exam for 4 chapters on Friday .\n\n\nThe teacher finished chapter 4 on Thursday .\n\n\nI  ' ve no time to practise the exercises .\n\n\nFor Music , the class has no Chinese student but me .\n\n\nThe teacher is racism that he always says my diction for singing\nEnglish song is not as good as the other students .\n\n\nAt first , I believe in him .\n\n\nBut , I still can't get high mark in a singing test on other language\n, even I sing Cantonese song .\n\n\nOn the evaluation sheet , every condition is stated either excellent\nor good .\n\n\nOr I  ' m a Chinese , the other students get higher marks even they\nsing non-English song badly , such as they  ' ve pauses in uncertain areas or\nthey sing out of tone .\n\n\nI regret I take Music , I believe my counsellor wrongly that I can\nlearn how to play piano .\n\n\nWhen I know that it  ' s only for vocal , It  ' s impossible for me to\nchange the course as he  ' s so lazy .\n\n\nIf my surname isn't start with \" L \" , I won't be a\nstudent under the control of this famous lazy man . \n\n \n\n\" Do you love Canada ?

{"text": "Special Feature of Black-faced Spoonbill    \n\n\n By Black-faced spoonbill Research Group , Hong Kong Bird\nWatching Society  \n\n\n\n\n \n\nRecently , Black-faced Spoonbill which used to be the flagship\nspecies in Mai Po wetland , has become a hot topic again .\n\n\nIt is now a successful example for international conservation\nprogrammes .\n\n\nIn recent international census , researchers found that the world\npopulation of this globally threatened species is escalating steadily .\n\n\nOne of the reasons would be conservation efforts made by a number of\ncollaborating countries .\n\n\nNow the Black-faced Spoonbill Research Group of the Hong Kong Bird\nWatching Society is presenting the detailed and in-depth feature story of\nBlack-faced Spoonbill and providing you the most comprehensive information on\nthis spectacular series .   \n\n\n Discovery of Black-faced Spoonbill in HK   \n\n \n\nThe first Black-faced Spoonbill was collected and named in 1849 .\n\n\nIn the early 1900s , an ornithologist , La Touche , noted that\nBlack-faced Spoonbill was not uncommon in the southeastern coast of China .\n\n\nThe first official local record of Black-faced Spoonbill in Hong Kong\nwas made by the Hong Kong Birdwatching Society on 14 November 1956 in Mai Po\nMarshes .\n\n\nAccording to  The Avifauna of Hong Kong  , the number of\nBlack-faced Spoonbills in Hong Kong remained below 35 in the early 1980s;\nhowever , it gradually increased during the 1990s , and exceeded 200 in\nwinter of 2001-02 .    \n\n\n Family and Genus   \n\n \n\nBlack-faced Spoonbill is a member of the family Threskiornithidae\nand the order Ciconiiformes .\n\n \n\nThis worldwide family includes ibises and spoonbills , and\ncomprises 28 species .\n\n\nIn the genus  Platalea  (  spoonbills ) , there are only six\nspecies .\n\n\nAfrican Spoonbill is restricted to Africa .\n\n\nThe beautiful pink roseate Spoonbill is distributed in the region of\nNorth and South America .\n\n\nIn Australia , there are two species of spoonbills - Yellow-billed\nSpoonbill and Royal Spoonbill . Eurasian Spoonbill and Black-faced Spoonbill\ncan be seen in Asia .\n\n\nThe world population of Black-faced Spoonbill is about a thousand ,\nand it is classified as \" Endangered: species by BirdLife International .\n  \n\n\n What does it look like ?    Chinese translation\n\n\n \n\nThe name of Black-faced Spoonbill actually comes from its\nappearance .\n\n\nThe long bill is enlarged at the tip , forming a spoon-shaped\nstructure .\n\n\nIts facial colour is different from Eurasian Spoonbill by having a\nlarger black facial skin .\n\n\nApart from its black face , bill and long feet , its entire plumage\nis white in colour except in breeding season .\n\n\nIt is also dubbed as a  ' Black-faced dancer ' in Taiwan since its\nbehaviour and posture while feeding , wading and flight are elegant . \n  \n\n\n Facial pattern  \n\n \n\nThe facial skin is black .\n\n\nMature individuals have a yellow patch in front of the eyes which can\nbe seen year round .    \n\n\n Bill  \n\n \n\nThe bill of the juvenile is pinkish and the upper surface is\nsmooth .\n\n\nAs the bird gets older , the colour turns darker and horizontal\nridges are formed on the upper surface .\n\n\nMales have longer bills (  19-21 cm ) than females (  16-18 cm ) . \n  \n\n\n Primary feather  \n\n \n\nImmature birds have black tips on their primary feathers .\n\n\nThis gradually disappears until the bird reaches the age of 5 or\nolder .    \n\n\n Breeding plumage  \n\n \n\nBlack-faced Spoonbill assumes breeding plumage in late winter ,\nincluding golden orange colouration on the neck , breast and head .    \n\n\n Size  \n\n \n\nBlack-faced Spoonbill is smaller than the commonly seen Great\nEgret (  left ) .\n\n\nBody length is around 75-80 cm .\n\n\nIn general , males are larger than females , but the difference is\nnot obvious in the field .   \n\n\n World Population and Protection Status   \n\n \n\nIn 1989 Hong Kong ornithologists drew global attention to the\nthreatened status of this declining population .\n\n\nThe historical status of Black-faced Spoonbill and the reason for\ntheir present small number is still poorly understood . \n\n \n\nIn the early 90s the known world population of Black-faced\nSpoonbill was 294 individuals .\n\n\nThe small population size , possibility of serious short-term decline\n, and its geographical restriction to East Asia might have led to its\nextinction .\n\n\nIts global status was listed as \" Critically Endangered ,\n&rdquo; evoking global awareness thereafter .\n\n\nThe known population gradually grew during the 90s , partly as a\nresult of more frequent survey , escalating conservation effort , and\nsuccessful breeding .\n\n\nIn October 2000 , the international conservation status of this\nspecies was changed by BirdLife International to \" Endangered\" .\n\n\nHowever , this species still requires international conservation and\nconcern .    \n\n\n Distribution    \n\n \n\nBlack-faced Spoonbill is a migratory bird which breeds in the\ntemperate region during summer; and migrates south to subtropical and\ntropical regions in autumn and winter , then returns to the northern breeding\nsites in early spring .\n\n\nThe only confirmed breeding grounds are the islands at Changshan\nQundao , off the coast of Liaoning Province of China , and isles located at\nthe Demilitarized Zone west of the Korean Peninsula . \n\n \n\nThe three major known wintering grounds of Black-faced Spoonbill\ninclude Tsengwen estuary in Taiwan , Mai Po Inner Deep Bay in Hong Kong , and\nthe Red River delta in Vietnam .\n\n\nOther wintering sites are located at the coastal areas of Macau SAR ,\nFukian , Guangdong , Gunagxi and Hainan Provinces .\n\n\nSouth Korea and Japan have also been found hosting a small wintering\npopulation .\n\n\nThe situation along the coasts between east of the China and Vietnam\nis still poorly known . \n\n \n\nThe Black-faced Spoonbills in Hong Kong are commonly seen around\nMai Po Inner Deep Bay areas including Mai Po Nature Reserve , Tsim Bei Tsui\nand Pak Nai .\n\n\nSometimes they are found feeding at the fishponds in San Tin and Lok\nMa Chau .\n\n\nOther records away from Deep Bay include Tai Lam Chung , Tai Po ,\nCheung Chau and Starling Inlets .\n\n\nThe resting sites of Black-faced spoonbills are mainly restricted to\nshrimp ponds ,  gei wai  in Mai Po Nature Reserve . Sometimes even\nthe whole flock is gathering at the same place .  \n \n\n\n Migration Route   \n\n \n\nBlack-faced Spoonbill is a migratory species .\n\n\nEvery early spring in March , they leave the wintering sites and head\nnorth to accomplish the most critical mission in their life - breeding .\n\n\nIn October they return to their wintering ground .\n\n\nThis life cycle repeats year after year . However , we still don't\nknow much about their long migration routes .\n\n\nWhere do they rest during their tiring journey ?\n\n\nDo they follow the same route when heading to breeding and wintering\ngrounds ?\n\n\nIn order to find out the answers to these questions , ornithologist\nfrom Hong Kong and Taiwan collaborated with Japanese researchers to carry out\nthe first satellite tracing of this bird species in the winter of 1997 .\n\n\nThey were first found moving from Tengwen estuary to the estuary of\nAo Jiang River in early May 1998 , and then located at Xiangshan Gang bay in\nmid-May 1998 , but then the signal ceased .\n\n\nSatellite tracking was performed the following year: 4 birds from the\nTsengwen estuary moved to northern Taiwan and onwards to the coast of\nnorthern Fujian .\n\n\nThese birds , together with the 6 birds tracked from Mai Po in Hong\nKong , which travelled northwards along the coast of eastern China and then\nreached Zhejiang , flew northward through the coastal areas of Fujian ,\nZhejiang and Jiangsu provinces .\n\n\nThey finally arrived at the islets in the Demilitarized Zone (  DMZ)\non the west coast of the Korean Peninsula .\n\n\nThis is the fist time that researchers have successfully tracked the\nmigration of Black-faced spoonbill , which signifies a breakthrough in\nlearning more about the mysterious aspects of this endangered species . \n  \n\n\n Breeding    \n\n \n\nThe adult Black-faced Spoonbills return to breeding grounds\nearlier than the juveniles do .\n\n\nThey use old branches and leaves to build nests that perch at the\ncliff on the offshore islands .\n\n\nThe spoonbills invariably share their breeding grounds at the Korean\npeninsula with other shorebirds , like Grey Heron , Cormorant and\nBlack-tailed Gull . On the islands in the Liaoning Province , the breeding\ngrounds are shared with Chinese Egret , Little Egret , etc . \n\n \n\nAfter their return the spoonbills start breeding in May .\n\n\nThey begin courtship , mating and laying eggs in early June .\n\n\nThe incubation period usually lasts for about 30 days .\n\n\nThe newly hatched chicks can leave their nests after 35 days .\n\n\nThey stay with their parents for 30 more days in their breeding area\nand finally become independent . \n\n \n\nResearchers discovered three nests in Lioaning Province in early\nJune of 1999 .\n\n\nOne of them was successfully hatched and the chicks were able to\nleave the nest .\n\n\nAnother two nests had two and three eggs respectively .\n\n\nNumber of eggs per nest ranges form 2-6 .\n\n\nThe egg is mainly white in colour and a bit larger than that of a hen .\n\n\nThey are usually stained with their parents ' droppings .\n\n\nThe eggs were believed to be a second brood as the first brood is\nusually produced in mid-June .    \n\n\n Behaviours   \n\n \n\n 1 . Resting  - Black-faced Spoonbill is a\ngregarious species .\n\n\nThey rest in a big group .\n\n\nTheir resting posture is quite special .\n\n\nThey bend their necks back and place their bills in the back feather .\n\n\nOnly the eyes and a small portion of the faces are exposed .\n\n\nThey mostly stand with one leg only . \n\n \n\n 2 . Feeding  - Black-faced Spoonbills feed in a\nspecial way .\n\n\nThey often forage in the shallow water (  5-20 cm ) , searching out\naquatic animals such as fish and shrimp .\n\n\nDuring feeding , they move forward slowly swinging their bills from\nside to side . Once the beak makes contact with prey , it will grab it and\nlift up the bill , to allow the prey to fall into their mouth . \n\n \n\n 3 . Preening  - Like most other birds ,\nBlack-faced Spoonbills love to be clean .\n\n\nDuring resting and after feeding , they like to stand in water ,\nflap their wings on the water  ' s surface .\n\n\nIn addition , they use their bills to comb and smooth their feathers .\n\n\nMutual preening of the head and neck acts as a form of social\ncommunication . \n\n \n\n 4 . Flight  - Black-faced spoonbill extend their\nneck and bill when they fly .\n\n\nThis is different from that of egrets and herons which fold their\nnecks . Sometimes , the flying flocks line up in a V-shape or a straight line .\n\n\n \n\n 5 . Playing  - Young Black-faced Spoonbills like\nto play with sticks and other tree branches .\n\n\nThis may help them to build up a better relationship with their\ncompanions .   \n\n\n Threats faced by Black-faced Spoonbills    \n\n \n\nBlack-faced spoonbills face serious threats on both their\nwintering and breeding grounds , including reclamation , coastal development\n, pollution , hunting and human disturbance .\n\n\nAmong these , habitat destruction is probably the biggest threat to\nthis globally endangered species . \n\n \n\n Reclamation and construction  poses the greatest\nthreat to Black-faced Spoonbill .\n\n\nFor example , the Taipa-Colane mudflats in Macau , which support\n5% of the global spoonbill population , will be adversely affected by\na reclamation project that includes various planned infrastructure , sports\nfacilities , film city , a casino , etc .\n\n\nThe extensive intertidal mudflat of Ariake bay at Isahaya in Japan\nhas been dammed and hence dried up since 1997 .\n\n\nConstruction of Inchon International Airport in South Korea in the\nmid 90s led to the reclamation of wetland on Sammok and Yongjong islands .\n\n\nA study in China showed that about 21,900 km2 of tidal wetland ( \nabout 50% of the total area of coastal wetlands ) has been reclaimed\nin china since 1949 . \n\n \n\n Economic and facilities development  has converted\nmany coastal wetlands into aquaculture ponds , planting site and industrial\nestates , all of which can be found in Hong Kong , Guangxi , Hainan and\nVietnam .\n\n\nIn Guangdong , development in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone ,\nhas greatly reduced the area of Futian Nature Reserve in Deep Bay , as\nfishponds there have been reclaimed and the nature reserve has been reduced\nto a narrow strip of mangroves along the northern coast of the bay .\n\n\nThe new construction plan of the western corridor might cross over\nthe Deep Bay area between Hong Kong and Shenzhen . \n\n \n\n Pollution  is mainly menacing the wintering\nBlack-faced Spoonbill .\n\n\nFor instance , pollution from industry and domestic sewage affects\nwintering birds in Hong Kong and Shenzhen in China .\n\n\nIn December 2002 at Tseng-wen Estuary in Tainan , a kind of bacteria\n,   Clostridium botulinum   , was found to claim\nthe lives of over 70 Black-faced Spoonbills , about 7% of the global\npopulation .\n\n\nIn addition , pesticides and fertilizers used extensively in the\npaddies around the Red River Delta of Vietnam were found draining into the\nwetland area , which may pose threats to the survival of Black-faced\nSpoonbills . \n\n \n\n Hunting  is unscrupulously common in China and\nVietnam .\n\n\nAt Liaoning , fishermen in China collect waterbird eggs at nesting\nsites .\n\n\nAlso , birds are still being shot even inside the core protected\narea of Dongzhaigang Nature Reserve .\n\n\nIn Chi-ku in Tainan , one spoonbill was found shot dead while\nanother was seriously injured at the end of 1992 .\n\n\nThis was believed to be a vindictive act by the locals , as\napparently presence of the spoonbills would prevent that area from\ndevelopment .\n\n\nIn Red River delta of Vietnam , the spoonbills are put in peril by\nthe large mist nets , airguns and shooting guns . \n\n \n\n Disturbance  caused by tourism is one of the main\nthreats to Black-faced Spoonbills .\n\n\nFor example , Dongzhaigang Nature Reserve of Hainan and Tsim Bei\nTsui of Hong Kong are famous for their mangrove habitats .\n\n\nAnd large numbers of visitors increase pressure to the areas .\n\n\nMudskipper collectors in Hong Kong and mollusc and crab collectors\nin Vietnam overlap habitat in intertidal areas , and this causes disturbance\nto spoonbills and waterbirds .   \n\n\n Research and Conservation     \n\n\n International Collaboration  \n\n \n\nThe first meeting for the conservation of Black-faced Spoonbills\nwas held in August 1994 during the world conference of BirdLife International .\n\n\nRepresentatives from various countries including Japan , North Korea\n, Taiwan and Vietnam participated in the meeting .\n\n\nIt was agreed to develop a conservation plan to protect this\nglobally threatened species .\n\n\nAn international workshop organized in Taipei in January 1995 by the\nBirdLife partner , the Wild Bird Federation of Taiwan , on the conservation\nof this species , and an \" Action Plan for the Black-faced Spoonbill, \nPlatalea minor  &rdquo; was produced in the same year as a guideline for\nconservation of the species . Follow-up workshops held in Beijing (  1996 ) and\nTokyo (  1997 ) , which involved experts from countries in the region , brought\nthe conservation a great step forward .\n\n\nMany recommendations made in the Action Plan and the workshops have\nbeen implemented , including the production of education leaflets and posters\non spoonbill conservation , joint censuses , cooperation on\nsatellite-tracking to study migration , and studies at key sites in all range\ncountries .  \n\n\n Legislation  \n\n \n\nAll bird species in Hong Kong , including Black-faced Spoonbill\n, are protected under the \" Wild Animals Protection Ordinance\" , Cap .\n170 .\n\n\nThe species is included on the Red List of Japan , which means that\nits conservation importance is recognized and it can be used as a reference\nspecies in environmental impact assessment for development projects .\n\n\nIn South Korea , it was designated as Natural Monument no . 205 on\n30 May 1968 .\n\n\nIn mainland China it is a National Protected Species (  Second Grade)\n, while in Taiwan it is protected as a Category I (  highest priority)\nprotected species , on the list announced in December 1995 . However , in\nVietnam , the species is not yet officially protected although it is already\nlisted in the Vietnamese Red Data Book .  \n\n\n Protected areas and habitat conservation  \n\n \n\n Hong Kong:  Mai Po Marshes was declared as a\n\" No Hunting Area &rdquo; in 1973 , and restriction on access ,\nscheduled under the Wild Animals Protection Ordinance , Cap . 170 , was\nstrictly enforced to prevent disturbances to wild animals .\n\n\nIn 1995 , the Mai Po marshes and Inner Deep Bay wetland (  15 km2)\nwas formally designated as a Ramsar site , and the Inner Deep Bay became a\nrestricted area in 1996 .\n\n\nA comprehensive conservation strategy and a management plan were\ncompleted for Mai Po marshes in 1997 , and the Hong Kong government\nimplemented the projects and management structure thereafter . \n\n \n\n Mainland China:  several important sites of this\nspecies have already been designated as protected areas , including Yancheng\nNature Reserve in Jiangsu , Shankou Nature Reserve in Guangxi , Fiutian\nNature Reserve in Guangdong and Dongzhaigang nature Reserve on Hainan .\n\n\nThe newly discovered breeding site at Xingren Tuo island in Liaoning\nhas been designated as a non-hunting area .\n\n\nAccess to the island is prohibited without permission from the\nForestry Department . \n\n \n\n Taiwan:  the Taiwanese government has already\nfrozen some potential development plans .\n\n\nSome local conservation bodies are now keeping a close eye on the\nspoonbill status and potential threats . \n\n \n\n Japan:  regular wintering sites at Izumi-Takaono\nin Kagoshima and Manko on Okinawa , and occasional wintering grounds at Yatsu\nin Chiba and Nakaumi in Tottori and Shimane , are National Wildlife\nProtection Areas; Manko was even designated as a Ramsar Site in 1999 . \n\n \n\n Korea:  Taegan-do , Unmu-do , Sonchonrap-do and\nTok-do in North Korea have all been designated as seabird breeding\nsanctuaries \n\n \n\n Vietnam:  Xuan Thuy and Tien Hai have been\nestablished as nature reserves .\n\n\nXuan Thuy was established as the first Ramsar site in Vietnam in\n1989 , and in 1995 the area was designated a nature reserve (  120 km2 ) . \n  \n\n\n Research  \n\n \n\n 1 . Satellite-tracking  - International\nsatellite-tracking studies carried out in 1997/98 and 1998/99 in Taiwan and\nHong Kong have deepened our knowledge of the migratory movement of this\nspecies and identified some important breeding and migratory sites .\n\n\nThe project was jointly implemented by Wild Bird Federation of\nTaiwan , Tainan Wild Bird Society; Biology department of National Taiwan\nUniversity , Wild Bird Society of Japan , Yamashina Institute for Ornithology\n, Hong Kong Bird Watching Society , World Wide Fund for Nature Hong Kong ,\netc .\n\n\nThe study was carried out in 1997/98 and 98/99 , and by late June\n1999 almost all of the tagged spoonbills were found on the island near the\nwestern coast of the DMZ of the Korean Peninsula .\n\n\nThis is probably the most important breeding ground for Black-faced\nspoonbills in the world , where protection is afforded by the current\nsecurity situation .\n\n\nHowever , concerning the migratory route from northern Jiangsu to\nthe western coast of Korea , nothing is known and more tracking work is\nneeded . \n\n \n\n Satellite transmitter  - about 15-25 g . will be\ndetached from the body in a year .\n\n\nThe battery life depends on the frequency of signal transmissions .\n\n\nSignals were sent out from the transmitter on the bird body at a\nregular time interval , received by satellite , and then returned to the\nreceiver on ground .\n\n\nThis enables researchers to get information on their migration route\n, transition area and breeding sites . \n\n \n\n 2 . Radio-transmitter tracking  - In winter\n2002/03 , 11 Black-faced Spoonbills were captured this winter under a project\ncarried out by the Agriculture , Fisheries and Conservation Department ( \nAFCD ) and researchers .\n\n\nThe spoonbills were fitted with leg bands and radio-transmitters in\norder to find out detailed ecological information on individual Black-faced\nSpoonbill movements between the Mai Po Inner Deep Bay Ramsar Site and the\nareas nearby . Similar study was carried out in Chi-ku of Tainan in 1996 to\nstudy their behaviour and activity , while information on their habitat\ncharacteristics including water depth , area , and height of pond bunds were\nalso recorded . \n\n \n\n Radio transmitter  - Researchers use receivers and\nantenna to receive radio signals .\n\n\nThese help them to locate the Black-faced Spoonbill . \n\n \n\n 3 . Colour bands  were tied on Black-faced\nspoonbills in Hong Kong and Taiwan in 1997/1998 and 1998/1999 .\n\n\nThis study shows that there is some interchange of birds between\nHong Kong and Taiwan , and also between other wintering sites . Of the two\nnestlings from Tok-do island in North Korea (  banded in July 1995 ) , one was\nseen at Izumi on Kyushu Japan in November 1995 , but the other arrived at the\nRed River delta in Vietnam in December 1995 , indicating birds from the same\nbreeding locality may winter in different places . \n\n \n\n 4 . International Census  - was begun in winter\n1994 by experts in Hong Kong , Taiwan , Japan , Vietnam and Korea . A global\ncensus conducted during winter of 2001-02 indicated that there were 970 known\nbirds .\n\n\nThereafter the BirdLife International affiliate Hong Kong Bird\nWatching Society was appointed to coordinate the international census in\nwinter 2002-03 . \n\n \n\nCoordinated by the Spoonbill Research Group of the Hong Kong\nBird Watching Society , the survey was carried out by experts from important\nwintering sites throughout Asia simultaneously from 24 to 26 January 2003 .\n\n\nThe result was collected and presented in the website of Hong Kong\nBird Watching Society at  http://www.hkbws.org.hk/waterbird/bfs.html\n , to facilitate information exchange and to provide an overall global\npicture of the wintering population of the globally threatened Black-faced\nSpoonbill and the conservation importance of its wintering habitats .\n\n\nParticipants for the census include ornithologists and bird watchers\nfrom Hainan , Guangdong , Xiamen , Shanghai , Jiangxi of China mainland ,\nHong Kong , Macau , Taiwan , Japan , South Korea , Vietnam , Thailand and\nPhilippines .\n\n\nThe project was kindly supported by the AFCD and included as a part\nof the Waterbird Monitoring Programme at the Mai Po Inner Deep Bay Ramsar\nSite . \n\n \n\n 5 . Age structure of wintering spoonbill  - The\nBlack-faced Spoonbill Research Group is now assisting the AFCD to conduct an\nassessment on the age structure of Wintering Black-faced Spoonbill at Mai Po\nInner Deep Bay Ramsar site .\n\n\nThis study commenced in 1998 , so the study conducted this year is\nalready the fourth consecutive one .\n\n\nBoth of the studies in winters of 2000/01 and 2001/02 showed that\nabout 60% of the wintering spoonbill population are adults .\n\n\nThe study is useful for predicting the global population of\nBlack-faced Spoonbill . \n\n \n\n 6 . Captive breeding  - A breeding programme for\nBlack-faced spoonbill was initiated in Tama Zoo in Tokyo , Japan , in the mid\n90s .\n\n\nA total of 21 eggs were laid from 1986 to 1998 , four of which\nsuccessfully hatched .    \n\n\n Public Education   \n\n \n\nIn Hong Kong , the Hong Kong Bird Watching society keeps regular\ncontact with the press regarding updated information on the species besides\norganizing the census .\n\n\nEducation programmes including outings , lectures and training were\norganized among schools and communities to raise their awareness and help\nthem to identify the species accurately .\n\n\nLocal NGOs including WWF HK designed a new image \" Lu-Lu\n&rdquo; for the species as a part of their programme , which appeals much to\nthe general public .\n\n\nThe Conservancy Association also organizes community development\nprogrammes to convey the message of the importance of wetlands to the public .\n\n\nOther places such as in Taiwan , the Chinese Wild Bird Federation\nhas also initiated and actively promoted the conservation status of the\nspoonbills .\n\n\nPosters and pamphlets in different languages have been produced and\ndistributed to a range of countries .\n\n\nA Black-faced Spoonbill Conservation Society and the Provincial\nEndemic Species Research and Conservation Centre were also formed and are now\ninvolved actively in Black-faced Spoonbill conservation .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c2bc0a66-e011-4cdd-b85f-76b67cb94811", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.848366+00:00"}
{"text": "Labour and Employment   \n\n\n &bullet; Introduction  \n\n \n\nThe tightness in Hong Kong  ' s labour market that had persisted\nsince late 1986 finally showed signs of easing in the first quarter of 1991 .\n\n\nThe Gulf War , high oil prices , and general uncertainty over the\ndevelopment of the world economy had taken their toll in curtailing\nproduction and employment in the last quarter of 1990 .\n\n\nThe swift end to the War in February brought exhilaration and euphoria\n, prompting a jump in world stock market prices and consumer confidence .\n\n\nOverseas economic performance , however , continued to be lacklustre ,\nand the Hong Kong economy grew at a moderate year-on-year rate of around 4\nper cent .\n\n\nEmployment grew slightly , but with the labour force showing some\ngrowth for the first time in three years , the unemployment rate rose rapidly\n, from 1.4 per cent in the last quarter of 1990 to 1.8 per cent in the first\nquarter of 1991 and then to 2.1 per cent in the period from February to April .\n\n\nThe provisional unemployment rate was even higher in March to May and\nstood at 2.4 per cent .\n\n\nWhile the tightness in the labour market seemed to have been relieved,\nthe labour market in the first half of 1991 was under stress of another kind .\n\n\nLabour shortage was frequently represented as the culprit behind the\nupsurge in inflation and labour was made to shoulder the cost of fighting\ninflation .\n\n\nIn 1991 , for the first time since 1983 , civil servants  '  pay rise\nfell below inflation ( as measured by the rate of increase of Consumer\nPrice Index ( A ) ( CPI ( A ) )\n) ( Table 1 ) .\n\n\nLabour was also made to shoulder the cost of industrial adjustment .\n\n\nFor the first time in Hong Kong  ' s history , in March 1991 , a large\npublic company , the Hong Kong Telecom , laid off hundreds of its workers .\n\n\nAlthough the lay-off decision was perfectly legal and workers were\ncompensated , the way the matter was handled was criticized as unduly\nhigh-handed , socially irresponsible , and widely condemned .\n\n\nThen there was the Trade Descriptions ( Amendment )\nBill , scheduled to be enacted on 1 July 1991 , that drew widespread concern\nand criticism .\n\n\nThe proposed law would permit garment manufacturers to have the\nlinking process of America-bound garments conducted outside Hong Kong without\naffecting the Hong Kong as country-of-origin status .\n\n\nLabour union leaders feared that up to 25,000 workers would be\nunemployed or underemployed as a result of expected shifting of operations\noutside Hong Kong ( South China Morning Post  , 12 June 1991\n) .\n\n\nIn short , the first half of 1991 was marked by tense labour-employer\nrelations not seen in many years .  \n\n\n&bullet;  Inflation amid Rising Unemployment  \n\n \n\nWhat caused the most frustration among the working class people\nin the first half of 1991 was the sharp rise in inflation amid rising\nunemployment .\n\n\nInflation , as measured by the year-on-year rate of change CPI\n( A ) , was running at 10.8 per cent , 11.9 per cent , 12.9 per\ncent , and 13.9 per cent respectively in the first four months of the year .\n\n\nDespite rising unemployment and weaker wage increases , rising wages\ncontinued to take the blame as the culprit behind the surging inflation .\n\n\n \n\nWhile labour shortage and wage pressures were important factors\nbehind the stubborn inflation in recent years , the surge in inflation in the\nfirst four months of 1991 appeared to be more a result of sharp rises in food\nand housing costs and indirect taxes .\n\n\nTable 2 shows the major movements in the CPI ( A ) in\nthe first four months of 1991 and those of 1990 .\n\n\nIt should be noted that of the nine major components in the CPI\n( not all represented in Table 2 ) only two components rose\nfaster than the all-item CPI during the period from December to April .\n\n\nThere were ( a ) alcoholic drinks and tobacco , and\n( b ) transportation and vehicles , lending credence to the\nclaim that indirect taxes and public transportation pricing were behind the\nrecent surge in prices .\n\n\nFood and housing costs also rose rapidly .\n\n\nAn indication that wage pressures were not important factors in the\ncurrent inflation is that over the period from December 1990 to April 1991\nthe cost of the labour-cost-intensive component in food , namely meals bought\naway from home , actually lagged behind the cost of foodstuffs bought from\nmarkets and supermarkets .\n\n\nAnother indication is that the cost of services -; another\nlabour-cost-intensive item -; trailed well behind food , housing, and the\noverall CPI .\n\n\nThe sharp rise in the unemployment rate , from 1.4 per cent in\nSeptember to December 1990 to 2.1 per cent in February to April 1991 , is\nconsistent with the view that wage pressures were falling .\n\n\nNo wonder labour was immensely frustrated by the commonly expressed\nview that labour shortage and wage pressures were to blame for the\nacceleration of inflation . \n\n \n\nThe truth , of course , is that while labour shortage and wage\npressures had indeed fuelled inflation in recent years they had become the\nscapegoat in the current witch hunt .\n\n\nThe unfortunate fact is that , notwithstanding all the clamour for\nHong Kong being a laissez-faire  economy , much of the Hong Kong\neconomy is regulated or uncompetitive .\n\n\nPublic transportation is a case in point .\n\n\nInefficient transportation modes are allowed monopoly rights and\npermitted to raise prices each year to bailout their inefficiency .\n\n\nTelephone services are provided by one company which is able to\nimpose internationally high charges in Hong Kong .\n\n\nHong Kong  ' s supermarket business is also extremely uncompetitive ,\nwith only two major chains essentially dividing the market between themselves .\n\n\nWith almost all of the territory  ' s food imported it is a mystery\nthat food prices can surge 6.72 per cent over a four-month period .\n\n\nIn any case food price inflation has very little to do with excessive\ndemand or labour shortage .\n\n\nThe surge in the prices of alcoholic drinks and tobacco , too , had\nnothing to do with excessive demand or labour shortage .\n\n\nIt was a pure case of indirect tax passthrough .\n\n\nHousing was the second most important component in the CPI after food .\n\n\nIts price rose 4.41 per cent over the four-month period .\n\n\nA reading of the month-to-month rates of change shows that private\nsector rents were rising at a slower pace each month up to April .\n\n\nThe intense building activity helped bring more rental units to the\nmarket , and rent increases had slowed down .\n\n\nIn April came the relatively large rental increases in some public\nsector estates and rates .\n\n\nFailing to tell the true cause of the current acceleration of\ninflation , the government chose to boost local interest rates in May 1991 by\none percentage point .\n\n\nAlong with other additional anti-inflation measures , civil service\npay was limited to 10.43 per cent .\n\n\nThe government also called upon other sectors in the economy to\nrestrain wage increases .\n\n\nThe frustration and anger of labour was brought to a new height .\n\n\nSporadic industrial actions in protest occurred .  \n\n\n&bullet;  The Absurdity of the Anti-inflation Measures \n\n\n \n\nOn the surface , nominal interest rates in Hong Kong are low\nrelative to inflation , suggesting that they should perhaps be raised to\nmaintain a reasonable positive real interest rate .\n\n\nThis argument would be valid for a large and relatively closed\neconomy , but certainly irrelevant for Hong Kong , which is small and open\nand on a \" linked rate &rdquo; system  vis-&aacute;-vis  the\nU.S. dollar .\n\n\nFor international interest rate arbitrageurs , the local inflation\nrate is completely irrelevant .\n\n\nA 200 basis point gap in the interest rates between the United States\nand Hong Kong , combined with virtually nonexistent exchange risk , could\ninvite an infinite amount of interest arbitrage, putting pressure on the Hong\nKong dollar and hurting credibility about continued adherence to the linked\nrate system .\n\n\n More important , in 1990 and 1991 , the Hong Kong\neconomy was anything but overheated ( Table 3 ) .\n\n\nThe interest rate jump was therefore unreasonable on yet another\nground .\n\n\nRetail sales were weak .\n\n\nOffice rents were falling .\n\n\nIndustrial production was stagnant .\n\n\nThe recent strength of the U.S. dollar also was hurting the\ncompetitiveness of Hong Kong products in the months to come .\n\n\nThe boosting of local interest rates would dampen economic\nperformance further , leading to a decline in tax revenues .\n\n\nThe irony was that much of the recent inflation was actually the\ndirect result of increases in indirect taxes in pursuit of higher revenue .\n\n\n \n\nAccording to Table 4 , employment in both manufacturing and\nconstruction was falling in 1990 .\n\n\nThis trend was known to persist well into 1991 .\n\n\nAlthough employment in the service sector was growing , the growth\nwas not really due to an expansion in final demand .\n\n\nThe hotel industry is a case in point .\n\n\nVisitors to Hong Kong for the first four months of 1991 were\n1,782,917 , a drop of 4.1 per cent from the previous year .\n\n\nThe number of rooms of Hong Kong Tourist Association approved hotels\n, however , had risen from 27,231 to 29,105 , or 6.9 per cent between March\n1990 and March 1991 , creating positions in the industry .\n\n\nSimilarly , the continued development of new towns and housing\nestates have created new shopping plazas and restaurants , creating positions\nin the restaurant and retail business to serve the local retail market , but\nthe rise in retail employment does not mean that the retail business was\nbooming .\n\n\nTo curtail demand as a means of fighting inflation was totally\nunwarranted in the circumstances . \n\n \n\nThis , however , is not to say that inflation is not a problem in\nHong Kong .\n\n\nThis is only to say that mindless inflation-fighting measures\naggravate the problem of idle capacity , depress the generation of real\nincome , and thus engender social waste .\n\n\nFortunately for Hong Kong , the one-percentage-point jump in interest\nrates was reversed on 1 July 1991 .\n\n\nThe quick reversal was as unexpected as the jump in the first place .\n\n\nThese policy initiatives had caused much confusion and arbitrary\nredistribution of income .\n\n\nThe government , however , should be commended for its courage to\nmake the policy correction .  \n\n\n&bullet;  Inflation Threatens Competitiveness  \n\n \n\nRegardless of what the source of inflation is , it will hamper\ncompetitiveness , other things being equal .\n\n\nAs wages and rents rise , even if only nominally , competitiveness\nsuffers because the Hong Kong dollar is linked to the U.S. dollar .\n\n\n All cost increases therefore translate into a cost\nrise in terms of U.S. dollars .\n\n\nFortunately for Hong Kong , wage inflation is not unique to Hong Kong\n, and all the other three \" dragons &rdquo; -; South Korea,\nSingapore and Taiwan -; are facing the same problem of labour shortage .\n\n\nTable 5 shows that all the newly industrializing economies (\nNIEs ) have very low unemployment rates &semi;\n\n\nTable 6 shows that industrial wages in some of the other NIEs ,\nparticularly South Korea , were surging ahead at an even faster pace than in\nHong Kong .\n\n\nRecent exchange rate movements , however, reduced significantly Hong\nKong  ' s relative advantage ( except with respect to Singapore )\n, and further disproportionate inflation in Hong Kong would hurt\ncompetitiveness more . \n\n \n\nOne factor in Hong Kong  ' s favour , one that cannot be\noveremphasized, is the accessibility to cheap labour and cheap land just\nnorth of the border .\n\n\nAccording to one estimate ,  \" wages and factory space\nrentals in a typical country in the Pearl River Delta region were recently\nonly about one-seventh and one-ninth of the corresponding levels in Hong Kong .\n&rdquo;  \n\n\nAlthough many Taiwanese manufacturers are investing in Mainland China\nand are taking advantage of the same favourable factors , they cannot compare\nwith Hong Kong entrepreneurs in both scale and intensity .\n\n\nLocational proximity , an intimate knowledge of the ins and outs of\ndoing business in China obtained from a much longer involvement in the\nChinese economy , combine to give Hong Kong manufacturers a unique advantage.\n\n\n\n \" By 1990 , it was reported that nearly 20,000\nfactories in the Pearl River Delta region were engaged in outward-processing\nfor Hong Kong companies . &rdquo;  \n\n\nCombined with the some 7,000 Sino-Hong Kong joint ventures, they\n \" employed , directly or indirectly , a workforce of over three\nmillion, which was about four times as large as Hong Kong  ' s own\nmanufacturing workforce. &rdquo;   \n\n \n\nActually , for many manufacturers , outward processing is\ndictated by the survival instinct .\n\n\nAs more manufacturers move their production lines north , the\npressure increases for other manufacturers to follow .\n\n\nFor most manufacturers , substituting capital for labour and for land\nor shifting into other products poses great risks and may even be impossible\nfor lack of technical know-how or financing .\n\n\nMaintaining old production lines in Hong Kong also is not viable\nbecause of the higher cost of operation .\n\n\nThe Hong Kong Federation of Industries has found that , among 411\nfirms surveyed in 1990 , 160 firms ( 39 per cent ) have\noperations outside Hong Kong , almost all in China .\n\n\nThis outward processing activity helps to relieve the pressure of\nlabour shortage on the Hong Kong economy , but it also brings a significant\nnumber of Hong Kong belongers into China to work in various capacities .\n\n\nTable 7 shows that an estimated 45,600 people had worked in China in\nthe twelve-month period previous to the survey in late 1989 .\n\n\nThis was down from 52,300 in the previous year , reflecting the\nshort-term tightening of the labour market in Hong Kong in 1989 .\n\n\nAs the tightness is alleviated by the economic slowdown and outward\nprocessing continues to expand , it is expected that the number of Hong Kong\ncitizens working in China will increase again .  \n\n\n&bullet;  The Need for Importation of Labour as a Safety Valve\n \n\n \n\nAt the time of writing , Hong Kong  ' s unemployment rate for\nFebruary to April 1991 had risen to 2.1 per cent ( seasonally adjusted\n) , up from 1.4 per cent in the last quarter of 1990 .\n\n\nThe provisional unemployment rate for March to May 1991 was even\nhigher , at 2.4 per cent .\n\n\nThe \" underemployment rate &rdquo;

Y.   \n\n\n Bauhinias (    Bauhinia   spp.)\n \n\n \n\nThe   Bauhinia   genus has several\nhundred species characterized by deeply-cleft two-lobed leaves that resemble\nin outline the camel  ' s hoof .\n\n\nThe wide geographical range covers the Old and the New Worlds tropics\nin both hemispheres .\n\n\nMost species produce large , showy and fragrant flowers with an\norchid-like structure .\n\n\nThey are some of the most attractive flowering trees , referred to\ncollectively as Butterfly Trees , that are widely planted in warm areas as\nornamental in gardens , parks and roadsides .\n\n\nWhile some species are trees , others are shrubs and climbers . \n\n \n\nThe genus name   Bauhinia  \ncommemorates two Swiss botanist brothers John (  1541-1613 ) and Casper ( \n1560-1624 ) Bauhin .\n\n\nThe two lobes of the leaves symbolize the two brothers .\n\n\nThe specific epithet of the species ,   Bauhinia\n blakeana  (  Hong Kong Orchid Tree ) commemorates Sir Henry\nBlake , the Governor of Hong Kong (  1898-1903 ) .\n\n\nThe tree was first discovered by the fathers of a French mission\nsituated on a hilltop near the sea in Pokfulam .\n\n\nThe species was approved as our city  ' s emblem flower in 1965 by the\nUrban Council which also adopted the stylised form as its logo . \n\n \n\nHong Kong Orchid Tree , an indigenous evergreen , is one of the\nmost beautiful Bauhinias in cultivation .\n\n\nIt produces large deep purple-red flowers with a delicate scent in\nprofusion from late autumn to early spring .\n\n\nEven rather scrawny and short trees can manage to send out a\nreasonable show .\n\n\nAlthough a maximum height of about 10 metres can be reached , many\nhave a dwarfing tendency .\n\n\nA handsome and tall specimen can be found in the memorial garden of\nCity Hall (  Fig . 2.1 ) . \n\n \n\nThe tree is sterile , that is , viable seeds cannot be produced .\n\n\nIt is believed to be a cross between two allied species , namely B .\n variegata  and B.  purpurea  .\n\n\nThe offspring of such union of two species , known as hybrids , are\noften unable to reproduce successfully by normal means .\n\n\nThe tree is therefore propagated vegetatively , usually by means of\nstem cuttings . \n\n \n\nThe tree prospers in sunny sites sheltered from cold and salty\nwinds and prefers well-drained , deep , friable and fertile soils .\n\n\nIt has a tendency to develop anon-erect trunk and an untidy branching\nform .\n\n\nA more upright habit , however , can be encouraged by the removal of\nsome competing leaders when the tress is still young .\n\n\nSuch artificial means to improve a tree  ' s form is known as \nbranch training .  \n\n \n\nTwo other  Bauhinia  trees , both deciduous ,\nare commonly planted in Hong Kong . The Camel  ' s Foot or Poor Man  ' s Orchid ( \nB.  variegata   ) was introduced from south China .\n\n\nIt gets the specific epithet form the streaky or variegated colours\nof the dominantly pinkish petals .\n\n\nThe flowering period , from spring to early summer , is different\nfrom the other  Bauhinia  trees .\n\n\nOften the blossom appears before the formation of new leaves .\n\n\nA   candida   variety carries white\nflowers which bloom after the emergence of a new foliage . \n\n \n\nCamel  ' s Foot is a short tree with a maximum height of 6 metres .\n\n\nIt is the shortest of the locally cultivated  Bauhinia\n trees .\n\n\nThe branches are fewer , stronger , and tend to take up a more erect\nposture in comparison with its allies .\n\n\nLarge pods , up to 30 cm long , turn from green to a ripened black\nand hang on the tree in summer . \n\n \n\nThe deciduous Purple Camel  ' s Foot (  B.  purpurea   ) is\nnative to Hong Kong .\n\n\nThe specific epithet refers to the colour of the fragrant flowers .\n\n\nThey appear in late autumn to early winter , a period that coincides\nwith the early part of Hong Kong Orchid  ' s long flowering duration .\n\n\nThe tree has larger leaves up to 20 cm long with a deeper notch\nbetween the two lobes (  Fig . 2.2 ) .\n\n\nAlthough a maximum height of 10 metres can be attainted , it is\nusually much shorter .\n\n\nLarge   legume   pods similar to\nCamel  ' s Foot are set in spring .\n\n\nThe tree is tolerant of and is in fact improved by pruning . \n\n \n\nThe Yellow-flowered  Bauhinia  (  B . \ntomentosa   ) , originated from India , is sometimes planted in gardens\nand parks .\n\n\nIt is an evergreen with a shrubby habit that reaches a maximum height\nof 3 metres .\n\n\nA good specimen is found in the Zoological and Botanical Gardens near\nthe greenhouse on the Garden Road side .\n\n\nThe specific epithet means hairy in Latin , referring to the soft\nyellow hairs found on the lower surface of leaves and on fruits .\n\n\nThe rounded leaves , about 3-7 cm long , are much smaller than the\ntree Bauhinias .  \n\n\n Golden Shower (    Cassia fistula   )\n \n\n \n\nThis is a small deciduous tree native to south Asia , including\nIndia , Sri Lanka and Burma . It has been widely cultivated in the tropics as\nan ornamental tree .\n\n\nAll the   Cassia   trees in Hong Kong are\nintroduced species . \n\n \n\nThe large  Cassia  genus has more than 600\nspecies of trees , shrubs and herbs with a pantropical distribution .\n\n\nMany species are amongst the most beautiful flowering and decorative\ntrees for the tropics .\n\n\nThey are commonly called Shower Trees because of the profuse petal\nfalls that often carpet the ground underneath the canopy .\n\n\nBesides the blossoms , they also possess fine-textured foliage and\nhandsome tree form .\n\n\nThe genus belongs to the  Senna  subfamily ( \nCaesalpiniaceae ) of the huge Pea family (  Leguminosae ) . \n\n \n\nGolden Shower can reach 8-10 metres in favourable sites .\n\n\nThe crown , with a not-too-spreading span of 4-6 metres , has an\nirregular shape .\n\n\nThe foliage density is rather high , and the branchlets droop down\ngracefully .\n\n\nThe single main trunk tends to fork at a low level into a few large\nlimbs .\n\n\nThe bark is dark brown and relatively smooth . \n\n \n\nThe genus name is derived from the Greek word  \nkassia   given to a related species .\n\n\nThe specific  epithet  comes from the Latin word\nmeaning a pipe , referring to the long cylindrical fruits .\n\n\nIt is also known commonly as Indian Laburnum and Pudding Pipe Tree .\n\n\n \n\nThe pinnate leaves (  Fig . 2.3 ) , alternately arranged on the\ntwigs , assume the pendulous disposition .\n\n\nEach  compound leaf  , 40-60 cm long , is composed of 4-8\npairs of  leaflets  .\n\n\nOppositely arranged on their axis , the ovate leaflet measures 12-15\ncm long and 6-8 cm wide .\n\n\nThey have pointed tips and rounded bases , and are bright green above\n, paler and duller below .\n\n\nThe midrib is prominent on the lower surface . \n\n \n\nMasses of very spectacular floral display can be enjoyed in early\nsummer .\n\n\nThey occur in clusters of up to 80 cm long that hang gracefully on\nthe crown surface .\n\n\nA healthy tree in full bloom can be wrapped around by the golden\nyellow flowers , each of which measured about 5 cm across .\n\n\nIt is undeniably the most splendid of the yellow-flowered \n Cassia   trees . \n\n \n\nThe fruits provide another distinct feature .\n\n\nThey are long cylindrical pods that hang on the tree for a long time .\nEach measures 40-60 cm long and 2-3 cm in diameter , and changes form the\ninitial green to chocolate brown and eventually almost black .\n\n\nTheir resemblance to sausages is the basis for the local Chinese name  ' sausage\ntree ' . \n\n \n\nThe tree  ' s native habitats are characterized by a long dry\nseason , hence it is tolerant of drought .\n\n\nIt needs a sunny site with light-textured and adequately-drained soil .\nIn view of sensitivity to strong winds , a sheltered position should be\nchosen .\n\n\nIt is intolerant of salinity in the soil and air . \n\n \n\nThe tree is best suited to ornamental planting in single rows\nalong roads and edges of green spaces .\n\n\nThe low branching height can be rectified as early as possible by\npruning . Besides the showy flowers and interesting fruits , a good shading\neffect can be obtained . \n\n \n\nThe branches , leaves and seeds contain a slightly poisonous\nsubstance which has folk-medicinal uses .\n\n\nThe sweet sticky pulp obtainable from the pods is used as a laxative\n, and also mixed with tobaccos and smoked in India .\n\n\nThe bark yields tannin and a red dye .\n\n\nThe hard , beautiful and decay-resistant wood is unfortunately not\neasy to work . It is mainly used for bridges , poles and miscellaneous\nagricultural implements . \n\n \n\nThe tree is sometimes planted in parks and gardens but rarely at\nroadsides .\n\n\nSpecimens can be viewed in Charter Garden , Upper Albert Road (  near\nthe Government House ) , and Middle Road Garden .  \n\n\n Pink-and-white Shower (    Cassia \nnodosa   )   \n\n\n Pink Shower (   C . javanica   )  \n\n \n\nBoth medium-sized deciduous trees set beautiful pinkish flowers .\n\n\nLike a number of other   Cassia   species\n, they have been widely adopted as ornamental trees in the tropics . \n\n \n\nPink-and-white Shower originally inhabits a small south Asian\nrange that covers north India , Bangladesh , Burma and the Andaman Islands .\n\n\nThe specific epithet means nodes or joints in Latin , referring to\nthe swollen part in the middle of the long filaments (  the stalk of stamens ,\nthe male reproductive flower parts ) .\n\n\nThe common name describes the flower colour .\n\n\nNotes on the genus have been given in the section on Golden Shower .\n\n\n \n\nThe tree can reach more than 15 metres in its homeland , but the\ncultivated specimens generally stop growing at 10 metres .\n\n\nThe crown assumes a spreading and graceful habit .\n\n\nThe dark greyish-brown bark has a smooth surface . \n\n \n\nThe pinnate leaves are alternately arranged on the twigs .\n\n\nEach compound leaf consists of 5-12 pairs of leaflets of variable\nshape .\n\n\nThey are mainly ovate to elliptic , about 4-6 cm long and 1.3-2 cm\nwide , with pointed tips . \n\n \n\nThe bright pink flowers , about 2 cm across , carry a sweet\nscent .\n\n\nMasses of them begin to appear in spring when the tree is still\nleafless , and keep on blooming for some weeks .\n\n\nUpon ageing , they gradually fade into white before falling off .\n\n\nLarge cylindrical pods up to 60 cm long , and maturing to a smooth\nblack colour , dangle on the tree subsequently . \n\n \n\nThe Pink Shower is a very similar tree that grows to about the\nsame height and spread as Pink-and-white Shower .\n\n\nThe major difference is the presence of sharp spur-like spines on\nthe trunk and main branches of Pink shower .\n\n\nIt also has larger and therefore more conspicuous  stipules\n (  bract-like structure at the base of leaf stalks ) that are up to 2\ncm long .\n\n\nOtherwise , the foliage features of the two trees are alike . \n\n \n\nPink Shower has a homeland that centres in Java , Sumatra and\nthe Philippines .\n\n\nThe specific epithet suggests its geographical origin .\n\n\nIt is also called Rainbow Shower and Apple-blossom  Cassia\n .\n\n\nThe latter describes the masses of pink flowers covering nearly the\nwhole crown in a manner reminiscent of the apple blossoms of temperate areas\nin terms of colour and luxuriance .\n\n\nThe rather long-lasting flowers appear in mid-summer .\n\n\nVery similar long cylindrical pods are also set . \n\n \n\nIt appears that the two quite analogous species can hybridise\nfreely in cultivation .\n\n\nFor this reason , they may represent a limited range of genetic\nvariability within one species .\n\n\nIn fact , C .  nodosa  is sometimes regarded as a variety\nof C.  javanica  .\n\n\nSome taxonomic authorities regard these two trees as subspecies \njavanica  and subspecies  nodosa  of the species C. \njavanica  .\n\n\nThis pair of trees illustrate the rather fluid concept of a species\nespecially in borderline cases . \n\n \n\nBoth trees are not particularly demanding in their soil\nrequirements .\n\n\nFor good performance , they should be planted in well-drained\nsandy-loamy soils of medium fertility level .\n\n\nTheir shallow roots do not provide a very strong footing , hence\nthey should not be exposed to strong wind .\n\n\nFull-sun positions are expected . \n\n \n\nThey are high-quality ornamental trees in terms of magnificent\nblossoms , graceful crown spread and fine-textured foliage .\n\n\nAs long as growth spaces are sufficient , they should fit in with a\nwide range of landscape situations .\n\n\nRoadside planting is restricted by the outstretched branches .\n\n\nThe roots of Pink-and-white shower are used as soap in Malaysia .\n\n\nThe heavy and hard wood may also serve general uses such as\nfurniture and tool making . \n\n \n\nA good specimen of Pink-and-white Shower has been salvaged on\nthe Cotton Tree Drive side of the Murray Building .\n\n\nOther trees of both species may be found in the Zoological and\nBotanical Gardens (  Fig . 2.4 ) .\n\n\nElsewhere they are uncommonly cultivated .  \n\n\n Kassod Tree (    Cassia  siamea  )\n \n\n \n\nThe Kassod Tree is a member of the large   Cassia\n  genus with well over 700 species of herbs , shrubs and trees\ncommon in the warm areas of both hemispheres .\n\n\nThe genus in turn belongs to the  Senna \nsubfamily (  Caesalpiniaceae ) of the huge Pea family (  Leguminosae ) .\n\n\nSome recent botanical publications have allocated the species to the\ngenus  Senna  . \n\n \n\nThe species is found naturally in a belt that covers India , Sri\nLanka , Thailand and Malaysia .\n\n\nIt has been widely adopted in modern times both as an ornamental and\nan economic tree throughout the tropics . \n\n \n\nThe genus name  Cassia  is derived from the\nGreek name   Kassia   given to a related species .\n\n\nThe specific epithet refers to one of its indigenous homes in Siam ,\nthe old name of Thailand . \n\n \n\nThe tree can reach a maximum height of 20 metres , though in\ncultivation the usual final height is a subdued 12 metres .\n\n\nThe somewhat rounded crown tends to become irregular in old trees .\n\n\nThe stout limbs bear both erect and drooping branches .\n\n\nWith a crown span of 5-8 metres , it is not particularly demanding\non growth space .\n\n\nThe dark-brown bark usually has a smooth surface . \n\n \n\nThe leaves , alternately arranged on the twigs , has a\nfeather-like (  pinnate ) compound arrangement .\n\n\nEach leaf usually has 8-9 pairs of leaflets organized oppositely on\nthe leaf axis .\n\n\nThe leaflets , narrowly elliptic in shape , are about 5-8 cm long\nand 1-2 cm wide .\n\n\nBoth the tip and the base of the leaflets are blunt .\n\n\nThe smooth greenish upper surface is contrasted by a somewhat soft\nand hairy underside . \n\n \n\nThe pale yellow flowers , about 3 cm in diameter , are rather\nshowy .\n\n\nThey also carry a delicate fragrance , and occur as terminal\nclusters towards the ends of branches in summer months . \n\n \n\nThe flat pods typical of many   leguminous\n plants  are about 20 cm long and 1-2 cm wide .\n\n\nThey are dark brown on ripening , rather hard , and tend to hang on\nthe tree for many months .\n\n\nUnder proper storage conditions , the seeds can remain viable for\nover 20 years . \n\n \n\nThe evergreen Kassod Tree is not demanding on soil and climatic\nrequirements .\n\n\nIt can tolerate infertile and coarse-textured soils , and a wide\nrange of soil reactions ranging from acidic to slightly alkaline .\n\n\nIt can grow well in both wet and droughty soils .\n\n\nFor the best performance , a deep and well-drained soil in a\nfull-sun location should be selected .\n\n\nIt can stand up quite well to strong wind and polluted air . \n\n \n\nKassod Tree is widely used as a shade-cum-ornamental tree in\nhuman settlements .\n\n\nThe final size is too large for our cramped roadside habitats ,\nhence it is more suitable for parks and gardens , or where wide planting\nstrips are available . \n\n \n\nBesides , the tree is often used to afforest barren hill-slopes\nin the tropics .\n\n\nThe strong capability to resprout quickly from cut surfaces allows a\nfrequent harvest .\n\n\nThe wood is highly combustible and makes a ready source of good\nquality firewood for some rural communities in developing countries . \n\n \n\nThe tree is sometimes planted for shade in coffee plantations in\nAfrica where it is known as the Coffee Senna .\n\n\nThe protein-rich foliage is used as fodder for some animals except\npigs .\n\n\nAs the tree tolerates some salt sprays and withstands windy\nconditions , it can be planted as shelterbelts in coastal areas to protect\ntree and arable crops from injurious onshore winds . \n\n \n\nThe wood , known in Chinese as ironwood , is renowned for its\nexceptional hardness , strength and durability .\n\n\nDespite the rather beautiful grain , it is not easy to saw , plane\nor nail .\n\n\nMoisture and termite resistance are two additional desirable\nqualities .\n\n\nThe timber is mainly used for general construction , musical\ninstruments , veneer and plywood . \n\n \n\nGood specimens of Kassod Tree can be appreciated in the\nZoological and Botanical Gardens near the mammal enclosures , and Victoria\nPark near Victoria Park Road .\n\n\nA few old but rather badly deformed trees are found in Cornwall\nAvenue in Tsim Sha Tsui .\n\n\nSome young trees have been planted recently in the gardens bordering\nChatham Road South .\n\n\nThe largest most majestic specimen is believed to be the one in the\nCemetery in Happy Valley (  Fig. 2.5 ) .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source":

{"text": "Life doctor   \n\n\n TRAVEL HEALTH   \n\n\n Dr Margaret Cheng  mharris@netvigator.com \n\n \n\n Here is a bit  of information I could have done with\na couple of weeks ago .\n\n\nThere I was sitting around with a group of parents and the talk turned\n, as it naturally does , to Japanese encephalitis .\n\n\nYou what ?\n\n\nYou don't have teenage kids about to go off on yet another school\nexcursion ?\n\n\nWell for those who don't , the Japanese encephalitis vaccination has\nbecome a must-have for young travelers to the Thai-Cambodia border .\n\n\nThe disease is endemic to China (  including Hong Kong ) and Southeast\nAsia but people have only recently begun to have vaccination against it .\n\n\n \n\nAnyway back to my story .\n\n\nOne child had been given just one dose , instead of the requisite two\n, in the recommended time before travel . \n\n \n\nThis can be a serious problem because in a small number of cases\nthere is a delayed allergic reaction to the vaccine .\n\n\nIf you  ' re in an isolated valley when that allergy kicks in it can be\nserious . \n\n \n\nSo what to so , asked the concerned mother ?\n\n\nShould she tell her daughter \" no shot no trip\" , allow her to\ngo if she promised to cover every inch of mosquito-attracting skin at all\ntimes or would the one shot be effective ?\n\n\nMy answer was to cover every inch of skin anyway because the\nmosquitoes in that part of the world carry the nastiest and most\ndrug-resistant strain of malaria known . \n\n \n\nBut I really could have done with the book on travel tips the\nWorld Health Organization (  WHO ) released last week . Entitled \nInternational Travel and Health  , it examines all kinds of illnesses\nand health problems a traveller may encounter , complete with handy \"\ndisease map\" . \n\n \n\nIt has also established a Web site (  http://www.who.int.ith/ ) ,\nwhich is well worth a visit before you make any travel plans . \n\n \n\nHowever , fears of disease were quickly dispelled as the site\nexplains that by far the biggest cause of death and illness when travelling\nis one for which we are yet to find a solution . \n\n \n\nI  ' ll let the author explain .\n\n\n\" Travellers are more likely to be killed or injured in\naccidents or through violence than to be struck down by an exotic infectious\ndisease , &rdquo; they say .\n\n\n\" Traffic accidents are the most frequent cause of death among\ntravellers .\n\n\nTraffic accidents and violence are significant risks in many\ncountries , particularly developing countries , where skilled medical care\nmay not be readily available .\n\n\nAccidents and injuries also occur in other settings , particularly in\nrecreational waters in association with swimming , diving , sailing and other\nactivities .\n\n\nTravellers can reduce the possibility of incurring these risks\nthrough awareness of the dangers and by taking the appropriate precautions .\n&rdquo; \n\n \n\nAccording to the WHO more than one million people were killed and\n10 million injured worldwide in traffic accidents in 1998 alone .\n\n\nSo what to do ?\n\n\nIt has a handy list of tips (  see panel right ) , although most are\nblindingly obvious .\n\n\nIn fact , they sound like a list our civil servants would warn us\nabout (  don't throw your TV set out of high windows , etc ) . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Life doctor   \n\n\n CONTACT LENSES   \n\n\n Dr Margaret Cheng  mharris@netvigator.com \n\n \n\n Ever wondered what your contact  lenses do while\nyou are sleeping ?\n\n\nNo ?\n\n\nBad luck .\n\n\nI  ' m going to tell you anyway .\n\n\nThey are supposed to be quietly soaking in disinfectant solution and\ngetting themselves into pristine condition for another day of sitting on your\neyeballs .\n\n\nBut some , according to a study recently published in the British\nJournal of Ophthalmology , may be soaking in a nasty micro-organism called\nacanthamoeba . \n\n \n\nNow this acanthamoeba , as the name suggests , belongs to those\nwondrous single-celled creatures we all met under the microscope in\nelementary science . \n\n \n\nAccording to the experts , our water and soils are teeming with\nthese denizens of the evolutionary depths .\n\n\nAnd just in case you wondered why these things are still around while\ndinosaurs have been and gone , the scientists have found they are very good\nat protecting themselves . \n\n \n\nWhile the active cells , technically known as trophozoites , are\nkilled by am eight-hour soak in lens disinfectant solution - usually\nhydrogen peroxide - that is not enough to knock off these little survivors .\n\n\nUnder what biologists call adverse conditions (  and a dunk in\nhydrogen peroxide is a pretty good example of an adverse condition for an\namoeba ) acanthamoeba form cysts , hard-walled dormant forms .\n\n\nAnd some of these cysts are able to survive a long soak in solutions .\n\n\n \n\nIf that  ' s all they did it wouldn't matter to much .\n\n\nUnfortunately , acanthamoeba can cause serious eye infection , and\nare especially likely to cause it in people who wear soft lenses .\n\n\nInfection with acanthamoeba can lead to a condition called keratitis\n, where the cells lining the eye become tough and painful .\n\n\nThis is a difficult condition to treat and can lead to blindness in\nsevere cases . \n\n \n\nPoor lens hygiene - leaving lenses in their cases too long , not\nregularly cleaning the lens cases , and not cleaning the lenses properly are\nthought to be the main cause of acanthamoeba eye infections . \n\n \n\nBut if these nasty things can survive a soak in lens solution\nwhat can be done to stop them ?\n\n\nFirst , most research has found lens solutions kill the active forms\n- the cells . Finding one that can kill the cysts is the best approach . \n\n \n\nIn the British study , the research team tested three types of\nsoft contact lens cleaning solution: one was a multi-purpose solution now\ndominating the market and the other two were both hydrogen peroxide solutions .\n\n\nOne of these was a \" one-step &rdquo; system and the other\n\" two-step &rdquo; system . \n\n \n\nFor those not expert in the cleaning of contact lenses , hydrogen\nperoxide , a very effective disinfectant , needs to be modified because it is\ntoxic to the eye .\n\n\nOne-step solutions have a catalyst added to neutralise hydrogen\nperoxide .  \n\n \n\n Novelty lenses look good , but hygiene should be the major\nfactor for all contact lens wearers . \n\n\nPhoto: AFP \n\n \n\nAll the solutions were tested for effectiveness against several\ndifferent strains of acanthamoeba at different strengths and for different\ntimes , ranging from 30 minutes to eight hours . \n\n \n\nAll the solutions had killed the active cells after eight hours .\n\n\nBut the cysts were more difficult to kill .\n\n\nThe two step 0.6 per cent hydrogen peroxide solution was the most\neffective .\n\n\nIt killed virtually all the cysts and had killed many after just 30\nminutes . \n\n \n\nThe multi-purpose solution - popular with lens users here - was\nnot as effective as the two-step solution , but did manage to kill off the\ncysts of some strains .\n\n\nSo if you have the right strain lurking in your bathroom , your\nmulti-purpose solution will kill it and its cysts completely . \n\n \n\nBut the one-step solution was not effective enough .\n\n\nCysts of all the kinds of acanthamoeba tested still survived an\neight-hour soaking .\n\n\nResearchers think this may happen because the catalyst used to\nneutralize the hydrogen peroxide also removes its ability to kill off the\ncysts . \n\n \n\nSo what does all this mean for lens wearers ?\n\n\nTo be as safe as possible , choose your lens solution carefully .\n\n\n \n\nRead the list of active ingredients and remember the two-step\nhydrogen peroxide solutions appear to be the most effective .\n\n\nAnd soak your lenses for a long time: eight hours or more . \n\n \n\nPay attention to your lens cases as well .\n\n\nBecause the acanthamoeba live in lens cases , the only way to be sure\nyou have rid yourself of them is to regularly clean and boil or microwave\nyour lens cases .\n\n\nEye experts recommend you replace them often as well . \n\n \n\nThe worst thing you can do is leave lenses lying in cases for\ndays or months and wear them now and again .\n\n\nIf you only wear lenses occasionally , you would be better off buying\ndisposable lenses and changing them every time you use them . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n LIFE doctor   \n\n\n Margaret Cheng   \n\n\nmharris@netvigator.com  \n\n\n Under the weather  \n\n \n\nWhen my dog rolls on his back , my children insist that it is\ngoing to rain .\n\n\nBeing in Hong Kong , where rainstorms are as common as roadworks ,\nthey are usually right . \n\n \n\nBut I  ' m not about to try to sell you a cocker-spaniel weather\npredictor here .\n\n\nWhat I  ' m talking about this week are the people who can tell , by\nthe pain in their joints , what the weather is doing . \n\n \n\nA few weeks ago , a reader sent us an e-mail asking whether\nhumidity levels had any known effect on arthritis because her joints became\nvery painful as the moisture in the atmosphere increased . \n\n \n\nThe answer is yes .\n\n\nAround now , when the humidity increases , mould spreads and moisture\ndrips on the floors and walls , people with joint pains often start to suffer .\n\n\nWhy is this ?\n\n\nWell there haven't been many systematic studies of this but back in\nthe 1960s a doctor persuaded a group of people to get into a\nclimate-controlled chamber for two weeks so he could see whether increases in\nthe humidity did anything to their joints .\n\n\nHe found humidity makes joint hurt more . \n\n \n\nPain and swelling increased as the water content in the air rose .\n\n\nBut that does not really explain why this happens .\n\n\nThe worst weather combination was a drop in barometric pressure and a\nrise in humidity , the kind of conditions seen just before a big thunderstorm .\n\n\n \n\nLater studies have asked people to keep detailed diaries of their\nsymptoms or put volunteers in climate-controlled chambers and changed their\nconditions without telling them .\n\n\nWhile not all the studies ' results were conclusive , women seem more\nsensitive to humidity and pressure changes than men .\n\n\nPeople with osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia are also most likely to\nfeel an increase in pain as the water level goes up in the atmosphere . \n\n \n\nMany people feel very uncomfortable just before a thunderstorm -\nmigraine sufferers as well as people with arthritis , multiple sclerosis and\nold joint injuries often say they feel more pain or are more likely to suffer\nwhen a thunderstorm is imminent . \n\n \n\nThe drop in barometric pressure is well-accepted as having a\ndirect effect on tissues in the joints .\n\n\nAs the pressure in the atmosphere drops , gases and tissue in the\njoints expand so the already crowded space - filled up with inflamed tissue\nand fluid - gets even more cramped . \n\n \n\nPain nerves tell the brain when things are just too cramped or\nthere is too much pressure on tissue or bone .\n\n\nSo those pain nerves start firing away when the barometric pressure\ndrops . \n\n \n\nIt makes sense that the same sort of things goes on when the\nhumidity starts to climb .\n\n\nWhether or not you have joint problems , most people feel their\nhands and feet swell up and get a general sense of \" bloating &rdquo;\non those muggy days . \n\n \n\nWhen your hands and feet swell , the places the fluid ends up in\nare your joints .\n\n\nSo what can we so about it ?\n\n\nIn the past , doctors advised people with climate-sensitive diseases\nto move to a warmer , drier place .\n\n\nIn this case it  ' s really just a dry place most people need , but we\ncan't all emigrate to the Australian outback . \n\n \n\nArthritics , for instance , might arrange to leave Hong Kong\nbetween May to September for a drier , more stable climate .\n\n\nHowever this requires a pretty good independent income or a very\nunderstanding boss . \n\n \n\nA cheaper , more practical solution is to invest in a\ndehumidifier and use it as soon as the humidity levels climb .\n\n\nEmploying more often those strategies that have been effective for\nreducing the swelling in your joints - gentle , structured exercises:\nmassage; postural drainage , for instance - should help counter the weather\nattack . \n\n \n\nFinally , use the cards fate has dealt you .\n\n\nYou are a good weather predictor - don't let your neighbours and\nchildren tell you otherwise . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n LIFE  doctor  \n\n\n Margaret Cheng   \n\n\nmharris@netvigator.com  \n\n \n\n<boldL Workers disinfect the area outside the Metropole Hotel\nafter it was discovered that seven people with atypical oneumonia had been\nguests; (  right ) a close-up of infected cells . \n\n\nPhotos: Reuters  \n\n\n Atypical pneumonia  \n\n \n\nFirst , let me explain what the experts studying atypical\npneumonia and the medical staff treating the virus are saying . \n\n \n\nLast week the World Health Organisation (  WHO ) held a worldwide\nteleconference to allow them to compare notes .\n\n\nIt was revealed that almost 1,500 people are known to have had been\ninfected and it seems to have started in Guangdong some time in November .\n\n\nOf that figure , close to three per cent have died .\n\n\nAnd while this is a serious infection , so far it is not killing a\nhigh percentage of the people it infects . \n\n \n\nIn other words , don't panic .\n\n\nUse common sense .\n\n\nStay informed , stay calm and follow the advice about keeping your\nhome and office well ventilated by opening windows; avoiding infection by\nstaying away from confined , overcrowded spaces (  lifts , the MTR , buses and\nplanes); and giving your immune system a chance to fight it off by getting\nplenty of sleep and eating plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables . \n\n \n\nExperts say the infection takes from two to seven days from the\ntime of transmission before you show symptoms .\n\n\nThe first sign in most cases is the sudden onset of a high fever ( \nover 38 degrees Celsius ) .  \n\n \n\nWe  ' re talking about a fever that burns you up then , half an\nhour later , has you shivering .\n\n\nYou feel so awful it is hard to carry on and the rise in temperature\noften gives you a thumping headache across your forehead .\n\n\nAnother symptom common in this condition is a dry cough , as opposed\nto the one associated with Hong Kong pollution , or what doctors call a  '   ' productive''\ncough , one in which you can hear the phlegm coming up as you cough .\n\n\nA dry cough is the hacking , sometimes painful variety that brings\nup no sputum . \n\n \n\nOther things to look out for are myalgia (  muscle aches and skin\nsensitivity that makes it hurt to even have a shower); joint aches;\nbreathlessness doing things that do not normally make you breathless (  like\nwalking , shopping , watching television ) . \n\n \n\nA few people have also had a rash and/or diarrhoea , but these\nsymptoms are less common .\n\n\nIf you have these symptoms a doctor can work out quickly whether you\nhave atypical pneumonia by doing a chest X-ray , as it wreaks havoc on the\nlungs .\n\n\nIn most cases , symptoms last five to seven days , after which the\nvictim begins to recover .\n\n\nBut in a percentage of cases the infection deteriorates into a\nsevere condition that cripples the lungs .\n\n\nThese people need artificial ventilation while they fight the\ndisease , and some of these are the ones who have died . \n\n \n\nAccording to WHO findings , most of the fatalities were\nsuffering from other medical conditions that had weakened them in the first\nplace . \n\n \n\nSo give your body a chance .\n\n\nNow more than ever , eat better , sleep more and take exercise .\n\n\nWalk up the stairs because you don't want to be stuck in a lift ,\nstop smoking and drink no more than two standard alcoholic beverages per day .\n\n\n \n\nAnd what about infection control ?\n\n\nWe know about the masks , but what about disinfecting: does it work ?\n\n\nI would say yes .\n\n\nThis is a weak virus .\n\n\nIt needs to live in our body secretions and it needs a fair amount\nof that secretion to be breathed in or passed from person to person . \n\n \n\nIf we are meticulous about hand-washing , disinfecting our homes\nand utensils , and keeping small children away from one another for a while\nwe should slow the spread effectively .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "49e7efc6-039e-48b7-a59a-2a4e8f4228cd", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.853424+00:00"}
{"text": "Kadoorie Corner   \n\n \n\nSome of Hong Kong  ' s venomous snake species\nwere discussed in the last issue .\n\n\nThis time we are going to introduce some common non-venomous\nnative snakes and provide suggestions on measures to take\nwhen you encounter a snake and even bitten by it in the countryside .\n\n\nCurrently there are 30 native species of terrestrial non-venomous\n\nsnakes and 5 native species of mildly-venomous snakes in\nHong Kong .    \n\n\n Snake Friend or Foe (  II )   \n\n\nLouis Cheung  \n\n\nKadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden  \n\n \n\nMany people fear snakes , believing they are either large and\ndangerous or extremely poisonous .\n\n\nSome are deadly , but in fact , most snakes are harmless and those\nthat are venomous often reluctantly waster their venom on humans ! \n\n \n\nLike most wild animals , snakes are actually afraid of humans .\n\n\nThey generally avoid human whenever possible and quickly slither away\nwhen approached .\n\n\nOnly when they feel threatened will they defend by biting .\n\n\nIn most cases , only those trying to catch the snakes , or even kill\nthem will be bitten by them .   \n\n\n To avoid snakebite , the following preventive steps should be\nfollowed:  \n\n \n\n? Do not venture into areas like densely vegetated scrublands ,\nforests , dark caves and tunnels - these are home to snakes . \n\n \n\n? You should be appropriately equipped before entering the dense\nvegetation: a pair of long boots and trousers can protect your legs from\nanimal bite .\n\n\nBefore proceeding , use a long stick to poke the long grasses beyond\nyou aside to check if it is safe to step forward . \n\n \n\n? Do not enter dark caves without adequate tools and lighting ,\nas these hidden areas are usually comfortable homes for snakes .\n\n\nA torch can make your journey safer . \n\n \n\n? Snakes may hide within rock crevices or under fallen tree\nbranches .\n\n\nAlways wear a pair of thick leather gloves when handling or moving\nthese objects in the wild . \n\n \n\n? When walking in risky areas , make heavier steps to create some\nnoises and vibrations .\n\n\nLying flat on the ground , snakes are sensitive to even a little\nvibration and they normally are scared away before you reach them . \n\n \n\n? Be alert when walking at night and in darkness .\n\n\nIn addition to the precautions mentioned above , you should also pay\nspecial attention to any strange noise made by animal moving in grassland or\nlitter .  \n\n\n If you encounter a snake in the wild , remember to: \n\n\n \n\n? Stay calm and still .\n\n\nSnakes normally do not attack stationary objects and this applies to\nhumans .\n\n\nRetreat slowly when there is a snake ahead . \n\n \n\n? Keep a distance from snakes .\n\n\nDon't get close to it .\n\n\nNormally the snake will ward off quickly . \n\n \n\n? Never try to kill snakes or it puts you at risk .\n\n\nYour intention to kill will put you in close contact with the snake ,\nwhich would be fierce enough to fight for its survival . \n\n \n\n? Never pick up a snake carcass when it is\nnot necessary .\n\n\nVenom of a dead snake is still poisonous .\n\n\nGetting venom in contact with your wound is\nequally dangerous as being bitten by a venomous snake .\n \n\n\n If you are bitten by a snake:  \n\n \n\n? Stay calm and do not make unnecessary move , or it speeds up\nblood circulation , spreading venom around your body .\n\n\n \n\n? Call Emergency Hotline at 999 . \n\n \n\n? Never attempt to cut the wound or suck the venom\nout of the wound .\n\n\nIt only puts the victim at greater risk or secondary bacterial\ninfection .\n\n\nThe one who sucks the venom might also fall\nvictim to the venom . \n\n \n\n? Don't take alcohol as this speeds up blood circulation . \n\n \n\n? Identify the snake species if possible .\n\n\nTake notes on its size , main body colour , head shape , and its\nother distinctive mark or behaviour .\n\n\nThis information enables doctors to identify the appropriate type of\nserum for treating the victim . \n\n \n\n? Never attempt to catch the snake that bites you .\n\n\nThis puts yourself at greater peril . \n\n \n\n? The first-aid course offered by St . John Ambulance Service and\nRed Cross covers first-aid treatment for snakebite .\n\n\nSeek advice from trained persons if there is one on spot .   \n\n\nHere we introduce several non-venomous native\nsnakes found in Hong Kong   \n\n\n\n Burmese python   \nPython molurus bivittatus   \n\n \n\n ID features:  It is huge and can reach up to 6 m\nlong .\n\n\nUnmistakable feature: brown trunk with irregular-shaped blotches;\ntriangular head with heat- sensing pits between the nostrils and the eyes for\ndetecting warm-blooded preys .\n\n\nA pair of spurs can be found near cloaca . \n\n \n\n Habit:  Python can be found in\na wide variety of habitat including scrubland , swamps and woodlands .\n\n\nThey are the only predator (  except human ) to local large mammals\nlike barking deer , juvenile wild boars , etc .\n\n\nThey occasionally intrude in domestic poultry farms and prey on the\ndomesticated animals there .\n\n\nPythons usually entwine its prey by its body and then kill it by\nconstriction .\n\n\nThis makes swallowing of prey easier .\n\n\nEach time females lay about 30 eggs , each is slightly larger than a\ncompute mouse .\n\n\nDuring incubation , female pythons wind the eggs by its body to raise\nbody temperature , until the eggs hatch .    \n\n\n Common Rat Snake   Ptyas mucosus   \n\n \n\n ID features:  Adults are 1.5 m to 2 m long ,\nyellowish-brown in color (  but quite dark in some specimens ) , young are\noften olive in colour .\n\n\nWhite crossbands can be found on the anterior part of the body (  ~\n2/3 body length ) , while black crossbands are near tail (  ~ 1/3 body length ) .\nBlack bars are seen on \" lips &rdquo; of upper jaw . \n\n \n\n Habit:  The most common non-venomous snake in Hong\nKong .\n\n\nThey can be found in many habitats .\n\n\nSometimes they might intrude in houses in rural areas when they are\nsearching for rats .\n\n\nThey are active in daytime , as they have very good eyesight .\n\n\nOnce caught , they would struggle and release smelly faeces from vent\nas a defence .\n\n\nSince rodents are one of their main food items , they help control\nrodent population in the wild .    \n\n\n Indo-Chinese Rat Snake   Ptyas korros  \n\n\n \n\n ID features:  Adult is large , with a body lenth of\nabout 1.5 m long . Body colour is olive brown to brown .\n\n\nA dark longitudinal brown stripe can be seen across each dorsal scale .\n\n\nVentral part is pale yellow . \n\n \n\n Habit:  As stated by its common name , it is a rat\npredator .\n\n\nIt can be found in many types of habitats .\n\n\nIt is fast in action and bites hard when caught .    \n\n\n Copper-header racer   Elaphe radiata   \n\n \n\n ID features:  It is large with a body length up to\nabout 1.5 m .\n\n\nIts body is brown with four black longitudinal stripes from \"\nneck &rdquo;

' \n\n \n\nSuch a positive attitude is what Hong Kong badly needs now as\nthe epidemic causes panic .\n\n\nAnd a key to defeating the virus causing the severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome (  Sars ) , according to the medical experts at the talk ,\nis to build and maintain a strong immune system . \n\n \n\nA healthy diet , exercise and sufficient sleep are essential\nways of maintaining the body  ' s immunity against illness in general .\n\n\nBut there are alternative approaches based on different medical\ntheories . \n\n \n\nProfessor Li Zhizhong , a visiting scholar at the School of\nTraditional Chinese Medicine (  TCM ) in Hong Kong Baptist University , says it\nis important to first understand how humans respond to climatic changes .\n\n\nAccording to Li , lichun , or the 45th day after the winter equinox\n, signifies the beginning of an unstable climate that alternates between warm\nand cold weather .\n\n\n\n'  ' In Chinese traditional medicine , it is the time when people\neasily succumb to illnesses that involve accumulation of heat inside the\nbody,' ' he says , adding that atypical pneumonia falls under the category of\nsuch illnesses . \n\n \n\nLi says the Lunar New Year on February 1 , which came unusually\nearly on the lunar calendar , might also have contributed to the outbreak .\n\n\n\n'  ' The Lunar New Year came a few days before  lichun  .\n\n\nDuring this time , people went out a lot to see friends and\nrelatives , travelled and ate unhealthy food .\n\n\nThis led to even more accumulation of internal heat,' ' he says .\n\n\n\n'  ' Besides , the winter in the northern hemisphere this year was\nunusually severe .\n\n\nThough it has been two months after the winter equinox , we have yet\nto see many warm days.' ' \n\n \n\nDespite the unfavourable climatic conditions , the professor\nsays there are a host of preventive measures that contribute to a stronger\nimmune system against illnesses , including atypical pneumonia .\n\n\n\n'  ' In Chinese traditional medicine .. . the essence of combating a\nvirus lies in maintaining harmony between the yin and yang forces,' ' he says .\n\n\n \n\nAn abstract concept the forces may be , but most of the\nsuggestions Li offers are practical and simple .\n\n\nThey include drinking plenty of water , avoid overwork , take\nexercise and ensuring good ventilation when indoors .\n\n\nFor alternative approaches , one can take food that helps cool down\ninternal body heat , such as congee made of rice , green beans and carrots .\n\n\nTraditional foods that can raise body heat , such as ginseng ,\nantler and dong quai , should be off the menu . \n\n \n\nDr Alexander Yuan Tai-ming , a homeopathy practitioner , says\nalternative medicine is effective in fighting the Sars virus .\n\n\nBased on the theory of  '   ' like cures like' ' , the treatment of\nhomeopathy involves heavily diluted solutions of natural ingredients , of\nwhich the content varies depending on a patient  ' s condition . \n\n \n\n\n'  ' In the past , homeopathy had been used successfully in\ntreating yellow fever , diphtheria and illnesses related to viruses,' ' Yuan\nsays .\n\n\n\n'  ' I don't know if I have treated patients (  who have come down with\nthe Sars virus ) .\n\n\nIt  ' s possible that homeopathy has cured them before their illness\ndevelops into atypical pneumonia.''\n\n\nHe recommends a daily intake of 30CP , a type of homeopathic remedy\n, as one way to strengthen the immune system against the virus . \n\n \n\nHowever , legislator Dr Lo Wing-lok , a specialist in infectious\ndiseases , warns medical practitioners to treat the virus in a strictly\nscientific manner .\n\n\n\n'  ' This is a new virus that kills and we don't know enough about it .\n\n\nIt  ' s not the time to make claims if a health- care practitioner has\nnot come across it,' ' he says .  \n\n \n\n Dr Alexander Yuan and Professor Li Zhizhong talk to the\nNHA . \n\n\nPhoto: Dustin Shum \n\n \n\nWestern medical practitioner Dr Tim Trodd , another speaker ,\nadvocates a conventional approach in enhancing one  ' s immunity against the\nSars virus . \n\n \n\n\n'  ' It is important we all minimise the chances of coming into\ncontact with illness .\n\n\nWe should take government advice to improve diet , not to smoke or\ndrink alcohol,' ' he says .\n\n\nHe also suggests taking supplements such as vitamin C , zinc and\nessential fatty acid that can all strengthen the immune system . \n\n \n\nTrodd says such measures are related to the terrain theory\ndevised in the 19th century by French scientist Antoine Bechamp , who\nbelieved disease came from inside the body .\n\n\nStating the contrary was Louis Pasteur  ' s germ theory which claimed\ndisease was solely caused by external bacteria that invaded the body .\n\n\nTrodd says while Chinese traditional medicine is in line with the\nterrain theory , the germ theory dominates Western medicine .\n\n\nNevertheless , he acknowledges the significance of the terrain\ntheory in preventing atypical pneumonia . \n\n \n\nTrodd recommends a regular intake of fruit and vegetables ,\nwhich cannot be replaced by supplements , in order to strengthen the immunity\nsystem .\n\n\nWhile regular exercise is essential , over-exercising , or\nexercising when one feels unwell , would only set back health , he says .\n\n\n \n\n\n'  ' Make sure you set aside some time to enjoy yourself every day .\n\n\nSpend time with your family , switch off the mobile phone , unplug\nthe land line or don't listen to the news,' ' he says .\n\n\n\n'  ' It  ' s clear there are new threats facing us today .\n\n\nIt  ' s likely to me that other viruses could come to Hong Kong .\n\n\nI really think it  ' s time everybody , not just the government ,\nconsidered ways to improve the health of the population as a whole.'

Certain people -\nfor example asthmatics and those with other pulmonary ailments - should be\nwarned against deep water diving , since they might not be able to control\ntheir breathing as well as they might need to .  \n\n \n\n Believe it or not , this underwater photo was taken right\nin Hong Kong by professional diver Craig Allery , who works with Pro-Dive ( \nHK-USA ) Ltd. and who has a master  ' s degree in coastal engineering . \n \n\n\n Back to School  \n\n \n\nYour bets bet is to seek out a good scuba school in Hong Kong\nseveral months in advance , so that you will have the skills to scuba\ncorrectly before you get on the plane .\n\n\nWhen choosing your school. , be sure to look for courses associated\nwith internationally recognized training agencies like the CMAS (  the World\nUnderwater Federation ) , NAUI (  National Association of Underwater\nInstructors ) , PADI (  Professional Association of Diving Instructors , for\ntechnical divers ) , SSI , BSAC or PDIC .\n\n\nFor details , check out the HKUA website , which also has information\non 32 scuba diving schools and clubs throughout Hong Kong . Here are a few:\n\n\n \n\nThe  Hong Kong Institute of Scuba Training  has been\naround since 1990 and has trained and certified over 2,000 local divers and\nfirst aiders .\n\n\nOf particular interest to newcomers are their trial sessions for\nthose who have never tried scuba diving before .\n\n\nThese include orientation course , a half-day program that allows you\nto try pool diving under heavily controlled conditions , as well as trips to\nsee the coral reef in Sai Kung . \n\n \n\nAnother well-regarded school is  Pro-Dive (  HK-USA ) Ltd .\n\n\n\nOpened in 1993 by PADI instructor Steve Chan , Pro-Dive offers a full\nbeginners course for &dollar;4,250 per individual , or &dollar;3,700 per\nperson for groups of two or more .\n\n\nAs with most professional run course , Pro-Dive students start by\nlearning about basic techniques and theory through book study and lectures .\n\n\nOnly after that can they head to the pool , and then out to sea ,\nusually in Northeastern Sai Kung .\n\n\nPro-Dive also has an affiliated company called Pro-Dive Travel Ltd. ,\nwhich organizes travel packages for divers . \n\n \n\nAt  Bunn  ' s Divers  , a beginner  ' s open water\ndiving course costs &dollar;3,972 and includes all equipment rental .\n\n\nIf you pass that , you can opt to take higher-level classes such as\nadvanced open water diving , underwater photography , underwater videography\n, cave diving and even scuba diving rescue .\n\n\nMeanwhile the  Blue Planet Diving Centre  has a\nbeginners NAUI diving course for &dollar;2,880 .\n\n\nIt includes four lectures , two swimming pool sessions , two open\nwater sessions and a NAUI certification card if you pass the course .\n\n\nFor more advanced divers , there  ' s a higher-level course for\n&dollar;4,230 .\n\n\nFinally ,  Scubaworld Hong Kong  has diving-related\ncourses , activities and gear , as well as travel packages and even yachting\noptions .  \n\n\n Escaping The Bends &ampersand; Jaws  \n\n \n\nFor the uninitiated , it might seem like the biggest scare for a\ndiver would be running into a shark .\n\n\nBut , according to the American Elasmobranch Society , there has only\nbeen one recorded shark attack on a diver in Hong Kong since 1820 , as\ncompared to 66 in Australia , 40 in California , 32 in Bahamas , 19 in Hawaii\nand 18 in South Africa .\n\n\nAccording to Craig Allery of Pro-Dive , \" encounters with\ndangerous marine life are not really your biggest concern . Most common risks\nhave to do with the actual behavior of the diver , like panic attacks ,\nrunning out of air , losing your diving buddy or ascending too fast - though\nall of these problems should be covered in a good diving course , &rdquo; he\nexplains .\n\n\n\" Even outside of Hong Kong , I wouldn't worry too much ,\nbecause the sharks that a diver will encounter are usually reef sharks ,\nwhich are non-aggressive . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nStill , there are sharks appearances and attacks every couple of\nyears off Hong Kong  ' s shores , and at least four local swimmers have died in\nshark attacks since 1990 .\n\n\nIn 2001 , nine South Island beaches closed because of two reported\nshark sightings . \n\n \n\nShark attacks were greatly cut down when the Hong Kong government\ninstalled nylon shark nets at 32 area beaches in 1993 .\n\n\nBut this has little meaning for scuba divers , who are not allowed by\nthe Leisure and Cultural Services Department to dive within the nets , and\nwho tend to stay away form popular beaches anyway . \n\n \n\nIf you encounter a shark , it  ' s probably one that has wandered\nclose to the shore while looking for fish to eat .\n\n\nBecause of this , never dive or swim if you have open cuts or any\nbleeding; sharks have an acute sense of smell , and letting blood into the\nwater is like a sending out a signal \" eat me . &rdquo;\n\n\nAnd if you are beginner diving , forget about diving at night .\nPro-Dive will only take advanced divers out for group night-time expeditions .\n\n\nAlso note that sharks tend to feed between dusk and dawn .\n\n\nPerhaps the most important thing to remember is that you should never\ngo diving alone . \n\n \n\nIt  ' s also smart be in tune to the behavior of the marine life\naround you; after all , their instincts are better than yours .\n\n\nIf you are diving and are suddenly surrounded by abnormally large ,\ndense pools of fish behaving in an erratic manner and fleeing in one\ndirection - then maybe you should be , too . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Get Out There    \n\n\n Rock Climbing  \n\n \n\nLearn to scale mountains on one of the many rock-climbing walls\nin the city .\n\n\nThere are a number of places you can learn to climb (  or hone your\nclimbing skills ) , but the two Kowloon branches of the  YMCA  ( \n Salisbury Center , Salisbury Rd. , Tsimshatsui , 2268-7099; King  ' s Park\n, Jordon Rd. , Yaumatei , 2782-6682   ) are generally considered to have\nthe best artificial climbing walls in Hong Kong .\n\n\nWith over 141 square meters of panelled climbing walls , the TST\ncenter boasts the city  ' s largest indoor facility .\n\n\nThe YMCA requires all indoor climbers to take either an assessment\ntest or their First Step Introductory Course (  &dollar;150 for a three-hour\nsession ) before climbing .\n\n\nIf the Introductory Course leaves you wanting more , continue with\nthe elementary Course (  a 12-hour course completed over four days ) .\n\n\nIt  ' s &dollar;450 for YMCA members and &dollar;520 for non-members .\n\n\nIf you want to work on your climbing technique , sign up for the\nSport climber Improve Clinic .\n\n\nThere are six sessions , two and a-half hours each , and the course\nis priced at &dollar;500 for members , &dollar;570 for non-members .\n\n\nClasses are every Monday 6:45-9:45pm , and Saturday 2:30-5:30pm .\n\n\n \n\nThe government also offers classes through the  Hong Kong\nMountaineering Union  (   Rm . 1013 , Sports House , 1 Stadium Path\n, So Ko Po , Causeway Bay , 2504-8124   ) .\n\n\nThese seem to be pretty popular , as classes for April and May are\nalready fully booked .\n\n\nBut the schedule for June and July classes comes out later this month\n, and you  ' ll probably want to plan ahead and sign up early . \n\n \n\nThere are more courses at  Qtimes  (   Rm , 6B ,\ntimes Centre , 53-55 Hollywood Rd. , Central , 2807-1481   ) .\n\n\nThe club charges &dollar;680 for 12 hours of instruction , and\nstudents receive a climbing certificate when they graduate . \n\n \n\nOnce you  ' ve finished your classes , venture out , climb some\nreal rocks and enjoy some breathtaking views .\n\n\nPopular climbing spots are Lion Rock Country Park , Beacon Hill and\nTung Lung Chau .\n\n\n-  Katie Luk", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "9735ef40-4a2d-463c-ad41-affa831f4179", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.856185+00:00"}

he said .\n\n\n\" We  ' ve notified Internet service providers , advising that they\nshut them down or they will be liable too . &rdquo; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  City Telecom may enter mobile market in 2006; Low-cost\noperator hopes government will open up sector with new licences  \n\n\n\n Hong Kong  ' s most aggressive discounter of long-distance call services\nmay enter the local mobile market in 2006 should the government stick to a\nplan to open the sector further . \n\n\n\n City Telecom (  CTI ) would consider a market entry should the government\nproceed with plans to sell more mobile-phone radio spectrum in three years'\ntime , according to its chairman , Ricky Wong Wai-kay . \n\n\n\n Long tipped to fade due to intensifying competition , CTI has defied\ncritics by maintaining customers , loyal to its low long-distance rates ,\nand has branched into local telephone services with plans to launch a local\npay-television service later this year. \n\n\n\n Although a minnow next to the leading players , it is one of the most\nprofitable operators , turning an interim profit of HK&dollar;112.86 million .\n\n\n\n\n Having a network that covered most of Hong Kong , it would be natural for\nthe firm to look at mobile , Mr Wong said , although he added that any\ndecision depended on the cost of market entry . \n\n\n\n Despite a crowded market of six , new operators are lining up as possible\nentrants .\n\n\nPCCW , which sold CSL in June last year , said it might return next\nyear . \n\n\n\n While the firm , controlled by Richard Li Tzar-kai , would be expected to\nfocus on mobile data traffic , Mr Wong said he would avoid third-generation ( \n3G ) services . \n\n\n\n \" I don't believe in 3G , &rdquo; Mr Wong said , adding that he had\nno interest in becoming a virtual operator on the back of another firm  ' s\nnetwork . \n\n\n\n He said CTI had more than 800,000 active users for its IDD , fixed-line\nor broadband services , a crucial advantage in entering the mobile sector .\n\n\n\n\n In addition , it had a cost advantage to other mobile operators who did\nnot have an affiliated fixed-line network .\n\n\nMr Wong said one of the major expenses for a mobile operator was to\npay the fixed-line connection with its cell sites , costing up to\nHK&dollar;10,000 per line per month . \n\n\n\n What is not clear is how the Office of the Telecommunications Authority\nwill distribute new licences for mobile telephony .\n\n\nAfter auctioning four 3G licences in 2001 , the telecoms regulator\nhas not decided whether to proceed with a similar system for its next round\nof so-called 2G voice licences. \n\n\n\n \" If it is auctioned , I would bid , &rdquo; Mr Wong said . \n\n\n\n CTI plans to launch its pay-TV service this summer with an initial 10 to\n20 channels .\n\n\nAccording to Mr Wong , CTI would provide a cheaper but different\nservice to monopoly i-Cable Communications . \n\n\n\n \" Cable TV penetration is only 30 per cent in Hong Kong , and we\nwould position to target the remaining 70 per cent of the market , &rdquo; Mr\nWong said .\n\n\nHe expected the local cable TV market to grow as new players entered\nand cited India as a target , which he said had 50 per cent household\npenetration . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Sunday brushes off price war   \n\n\n BEN KWOK  \n\n \n\nAn aggressive price war between mobile operators would do little\nto hurt Sunday Communication  ' s quest for its first profitability this year ,\naccording to group managing director Bruce Hicks . \n\n \n\n\" I wish we were not in a price war , but that is the\nsituation . I remain confident in making our previous forecasts this year ,\n&rdquo; Mr Hicks said . \n\n \n\n\" There is nothing clever about price competition .\n\n\nNobody wins in the price war . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nSunday last week announced a HK&dollar;88 for 500 minutes monthly\ntariff plan - 10 per cent higher than the plans offered by four of its rival\noperators . \n\n \n\nStable tariffs last year helped three of the six operators return\nto profits . \n\n \n\nSunday , one of the two loss-making operators , trimmed its loss\nby 45 per cent to HK&dollar;117 million .\n\n\nNo 1 mobile operator Hutchison Telecom also failed to make a profit\nlast year . \n\n \n\nOperators are now using aggressive pricing strategies , some\nequivalent to HK&dollar;10 for an hour  ' s usage , to attract subscribers to\ntheir network in a market which has more than 85 per cent penetration . \n\n \n\nMerrill Lynch has already downgraded SmarTone  ' s earnings by 10\nper cent to HK&dollar;357 million in the wake of the price war . \n\n \n\nMr Hicks said last month that Sunday had made a profit in the\nfirst quarter , and promised the company would become profitable for the year .\n\n\n \n\nHe said the price war would not affect Sunday  ' s profitability as\ncost cutting measures would come into effect this year . \n\n \n\nThese measures included cutting its workforce by 20 per cent , as\nwell as letting go of three of its highest paid executives last year .\n\n\nThe remaining staff also suffered a pay cut , Mr Hicks said . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n HK price war increases network switching   \n\n\n HUI YUK-MIN  \n\n \n\nThe renewed price war among Hong Kong mobile phone operators has\nsparked a surge in subscribers switching networks . \n\n \n\nOffice of Telecommunications Authority statistics show 115,727\nmobile users switched carriers last month , up 61.7 per cent from 71,578 in\nFebruary . \n\n \n\nIt was also the highest churn rate since March last year . \n\n \n\nAccording to ABN Amro , the number of users switching networks\nimplied a monthly churn rate of 1.8 per cent , against 1.1 per cent\npreviously . \n\n \n\nABN Amro analyst Mayur Nallamala said the jump came as operators\nlaunched cheaper tariff plans and waived a HK&dollar;140 fee on customers\nswitching networks . \n\n \n\nAnalysts said the high churn rate could continue in the following\nmonths as the price war heated up .  Mobile-phone operators renewed their\nprice war in late-February after No 3 carrier SmarTone Telecommunications\nHoldings began offering its PayGo service charging HK&dollar;50 for 200\nminutes . \n\n \n\nThe price war accelerated two weeks ago when SmarTone unveiled an\nHK&dollar;80 price plan offering 500 minutes .\n\n\nHowever , a SmarTone spokeswoman yesterday denied it had started a\nfresh round of price cuts . \n\n \n\n\" We didn't start a price war . Price competition has never\nstopped , it  ' s just in a different form .\n\n\nOperators have been offering different sorts of promotions to attract\ncustomers . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nSmarTone  ' s low-tariff packages were quickly matched by its\nrivals , with the exception of CSL , which offered handset subsidies in lieu\nof a price cut . \n\n \n\n\" In the end it is the same , &rdquo; said BNP Paribas\nPeregrine regional telecommunications research director Voon San Lai , who\nsaid all operators ' earnings would be hurt by the fresh round of price cuts .\n\n\n \n\n\" There is going to be a higher churn rate , that  ' s\nprimarily because the operators have started to look at price cuts . &rdquo;\n\n\n \n\nMr Lai expects the price war to gather momentum later this year\nwhen Hutchison Telecom starts to roll out third-generation mobile services to\npoach subscribers . \n\n \n\nThe churn rate fell last summer after a two-year price war among\noperators died down , helping all except Sunday Communications make a profit .\n\n\n \n\nIn 2000 and 2001 , CSL , now owned by Telstra Corp , was the only\nprofitable carrier . \n\n \n\nMr Lai said if the price war was prolonged , operators would head\nback to the cut-throat situation of two years ago , which could put some\nback into the red . \n\n \n\nBNP Paribas recently cut its 2003 earnings forecasts for SmarTone\nby 8 per cent as it expects the carrier  ' s average revenue per user to fall\nto HK&dollar;190 from its previous estimate of HK&dollar;205 .\n\n\nIt blamed the price war and a fall in roaming revenue on users\ncutting back on travel due to the atypical pneumonia . \n\n \n\n\" My impression is everyone will be a loser . In our\nopinion , this higher churn is a battle for everybody , and if it continues ,\nit is likely to lead to a repeat of 2000 when everyone was losing money ,\n&rdquo; Mr Lai said .\n\n\n\" At the end of the day , no one is going to win except the\nconsumers . &rdquo; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  A hi-tech base in the High Court  \n\n\n\n There will be no long pauses and shuffling of paper in Hong Kong  ' s\nnewest courtroom .\n\n\nThe &dollar;9 million \" technology court &rdquo; has been\ndesigned to optimise gadgetry and minimise paperwork in the judicial process .\n\n\n\n\n From outside , the hi-tech court - housed in the High Court building -\nlooks the same as other courts , except for a flat-screen television next to\nits entrance . \n\n\n\n Inside are hi-tech gadgets such as plasma televisions , overhead\nprojector screens , computers for lawyers , judges and court reporters ,\nclosed-circuit televisions and a video conferencing system . \n\n\n\n Lawyers will no longer need to pass paper documents to the judge as the\ndocument can be viewed on projector screens . \n\n\n\n When questioning witnesses , lawyers can ask them to pinpoint areas on a\ndiagram on the computer monitor using a pen .\n\n\nLawyers can also recreate the crime scene using computer animation .\n\n\n\" In cases where there are mountains and mountains of\ndocuments , you can simply scan them into a few disks , &rdquo; said Chief\nJustice Andrew Li Kwok-nang .\n\n\n\" This will make the trial much more efficient and costs\ncould be saved.\" \n\n\n\n It will be used for the first time in a civil case this week when lawyers\nwill use video-conferencing to interview witnesses from Korea and Belgium .\n\n\nPlanning for the court began three years ago and the &dollar;9\nmillion budget was granted the following year .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6dfc1627-5d22-4642-b7eb-79caebfd0b78", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.857618+00:00"}
{"text": "Depths of disaster  \n\n \n\nYet another tragic mining accident has claimed more than 100 lives\non the mainland . \n\n \n\nWhat is particularly depressing is that the casualty count for\nThursday  ' s disaster in a coal mine in Jixi , Heilongjiang , is likely to\nconstitute just over one per cent of the mining industry  ' s annual death toll .\n\n\nThat is based on the assumption that about 10,000 people , as in 2001\n, will be killed in mines across the country this year . \n\n \n\nSadly , the assumption can be safely made because there are no\nsigns that attempts by the authorities to improve safety in the shafts and\nclose unsafe mines will be effective in reducing accidents . \n\n \n\nFor one thing , the latest mishap has taken place while a\nnation-wide campaign on industrial safety is underway , with the month of June\ndeclared \" national safety production month\" . \n\n \n\nThe mine concerned is run by the state-owned Jixi Mining\nCorporation .\n\n\nOnly in April , an explosion in another mine operated by the company\nkilled 24 and injured 39 . \n\n \n\nAfter Thursday , all mines in Jixi have been closed for safety\ninspection , as happened after April  ' s accident .\n\n\nHopefully , when they are re-opened , the mines will really be safe .\n\n\nBut past experience has shown that we cannot be too optimistic the\nmines will not be struck by another major disaster . \n\n \n\nThe appalling safety record of the mainland  ' s mining industry\nhas been attributed to backward technology , corrupt officials ' wanton\ndisregard for safety , workers ' ignorance and illegal mining .\n\n\nUnsafe mines are often re-opened with the connivance of corrupt\nofficials and miners are driven by poverty to go down dangerous shafts . \n\n \n\nIn a notorious case , at least 200 miners were killed when a tin\nmine in Guangxi was flooded about a year ago .\n\n\nCorrupt officials and mine operators conspired to cover up the death\ntoll , claiming only 70 were killed .\n\n\nThe truth was uncovered only after repeated questioning by a\npersistent media . \n\n \n\nAs the high annual death toll suggests , numerous mining\naccidents with smaller casualties have gone unreported .\n\n\nThe mainland media would be doing the miners a great service if they\nwould consistently train their spotlight on the mines to ensure operators\nabide by safety rules . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  The start of the end  \n\n \n\nThe piratical frontman of the Philippines ' most dangerous\ncriminal gang may be dead , but the nation  ' s poverty-stricken south has not\nsuddenly become safer . \n\n \n\nAbu Sabaya  ' s death simply means the beginning of the end of the\nAbu Sayyaf , the Muslim extremist group believed to number no more than 60\nand linked by the United States to terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden  ' s\nal-Qaeda network . \n\n \n\nApart from Philippine Government officials eager for American\nmilitary and financial support for their country , few Filipinos refer to the\nAbu Sayyaf as terrorists .\n\n\nThe group does have satellite telephones , but its ambitions do not\nextend beyond kidnapping foreigners for ransom from tourist resorts and\nbanditry .\n\n\nThe proceeds are used to buy expensive trinkets , weapons and the\nsupport of impoverished villagers . \n\n \n\nThis is not to belittle the Abu Sayyaf  ' s activities .\n\n\nThey have hurt the Philippines ' tourism industry and turned peaceful\nfarming communities into war zones .\n\n\nThousands of Filipino and US troops are combing the Muslim-dominant\nislands of Mindanao , Basilan and Jolo for the remnants of the group . \n\n \n\nAbu Sabaya was personally responsible for dozens of executions .\n\n\nHis shooting on a boat in Sibuco Bay does not destroy the Abu Sayyaf .\n\n\nThey are one leader less , but not finished . \n\n \n\nSuch groups will only be eliminated when the lives of people in\nthe southern Philippines improves .\n\n\nAid and development programmes implemented by the Government and the\nUS are slowly making this happen . \n\n \n\nThe strategy must be dedicated and long-term and continue long\nafter the Abu Sayyaf are wiped out . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  To err is human  \n\n \n\nAs if it could anticipate the row over the standards of referees\nat soccer  ' s premier event , the official magazine of Fifa - soccer  ' s\ngoverning body and organiser of the World Cup - last month focused on \"\nThe Team That Cannot Win . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThat team refers , of course , to the 36 referees and 36\nassistants who have the onerous task of ensuring the rules of football are\nadhered to on the field by players who will do everything they can ,\nincluding cheating , to win and bring glory to themselves and their nations .\n\n\n \n\nThe anticipation was spot on .\n\n\nItaly and Spain have both blamed the referees for their losses to\nSouth Korea , one of the co-hosts of the tournament and the first Asian team\nto make it to the semi-finals in the World Cup  ' s 72-year history . \n\n \n\nFifa has received so much hate mail from enraged Italian and\nSpanish fans that the chairman of its referees ' committee has reportedly\nadmitted that \" there have been one or two major mistakes which are\ncause for concern\" . \n\n \n\nBut then no one should be surprised that Fifa should have\nexpected that referees would be in the limelight .\n\n\nAs soccer fans know only too well , there has never been a World Cup\nin which no games have been tainted by \" bad refereeing . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nTo err is human .\n\n\nThat applies especially to the referee and assistants who have to\nblow the whistles and wave their flags at the sight of what they believe to\nbe a foul immediately .\n\n\nA moment too slow with their reflexes , and the game will have\ncontinued , with unpredictable consequences . \n\n \n\nTheir decisions may not always be right .\n\n\nThey cannot be .\n\n\nAnd with the advent of technology , which allows instantaneous\nreplays of a foul from all angles , their judgment can be ruthlessly called\ninto question by officials sitting on the sideline and the crowds watching on\ntelevision . \n\n \n\nBut allowing television replays to help referees make difficult\ndecisions , a practice already adopted in rugby and cricket , is not the\nanswer .\n\n\nWhat is going to happen after the referee has stopped the game and\nthe replay shows no foul has been committed ?\n\n\nThe game will have been ruined and the disadvantaged side will\ncertainly complain . \n\n \n\nFootball is a passionate game .\n\n\nIt may be difficult for people to admit that controversial decisions\nby referees are one of the reasons why football is so captivating .\n\n\nBut that is the truth . \n\n \n\nFifa should try to raise the standards of referees and help them\nmake sound judgments on the field .\n\n\nBut it would be unrealistic to expect them to commit no errors of\njudgment . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Myanmar  ' s agenda  \n\n \n\nMyanmar  ' s junta has kept its promise and given pro-democracy\nleader Aung San Suu Kyi a further taste of the political freedom pledged\nafter releasing her from house arrest last month .\n\n\nHer week-long trip outside the capital to bolster support for her\nmovement is welcome proof of a change of heart within the military . \n\n \n\nIt is a step , but does not make political freedom more tangible\nfor Myanmar  ' s impoverished people .\n\n\nThe restoration of democracy , snatched from her National League for\nDemocracy party after it resoundingly won elections in 1990 , is still a\nmatter of negotiation .\n\n\nAbout 1,500 political prisoners remain in prison . Freedom of speech\nis still a hoped-for wish . Elections could be years away , if at all . \n\n \n\nMs Suu Kyi  ' s trip to Myanmar  ' s second city , Mandalay , and\nother bases of support , is a test of the military  ' s resolve .\n\n\nIf it allows her to meet whom she likes and to openly express her\nviews , there is reason for hope .\n\n\nFreedom of expression is , after all , the most fundamental hallmark\nof a democratic nation . \n\n \n\nBut there are other crucial features and these remain lacking\nunder the junta  ' s grip on power .\n\n\nLast week , a report detailed the military  ' s alleged use of sexual\nviolence against women as a weapon of war in Shan state .\n\n\nOther reports in recent months tell of people being forced to work in\nthe army and factories and mines . \n\n \n\nAs the world  ' s most prominent pro-democracy activist , Ms Suu\nKyi has a huge burden to shoulder .\n\n\nExpectations for her to win the battle of wills against the junta are\nhigh . \n\n \n\nThe pressure on the junta is far greater .\n\n\nTwo years of United Nations mediation has only restored some freedoms .\n\n\nTo be fully accepted by the greater world community , it must now\nproduce and faithfully implement a timetable for change . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  An elusive goal  \n\n \n\nUntil now , the central Government  ' s line on political reform in\nthe SAR has been to refrain from dwelling on specifics , merely noting the\nBasic Law has set out a timetable for changes . \n\n \n\nThat line has now been changed , with Vice-Premier Qian Qichen\nclearly stating that Beijing wants the functional constituency system and\nother characteristics of Hong Kong  ' s governmental system to remain intact\nbeyond 2007 , the year beyond which changes to the current system can be made\nunder the Basic Law . \n\n \n\nMr Qian  ' s remarks should not come as a surprise to anyone .\n\n\nBut it will disappoint those who had hoped for a more rapid\ntransition to a system of government based on direct elections and universal\nsuffrage . \n\n \n\nIt may be argued that Mr Qian has done everybody a favour by\nquashing any false hope that Hong Kong could make a rapid transition to a\nfully elected government .\n\n\nBut his frank remarks may also have damaged the image of Beijing ,\nwhich has been widely acclaimed by the international community for allowing\nHong Kong to exercise a high degree of autonomy over the past five years .\n\n\n \n\nFrom Beijing  ' s point of view , until the last years of colonial\nrule , Hong Kong had prospered without democracy for 150 years . \n\n \n\nAfter 1997 , the SAR  ' s political system has become more\ndemocratic than ever , as the Chief Executive , unlike colonial governors\nbefore him , is elected by an 800-member body instead of being appointed ,\nand half of the legislators are now directly elected . \n\n \n\nAlthough Hong Kong has no full democracy , constitutional\nliberalism is alive and well , with people enjoying a wide range of personal\nfreedoms that are denied to citizens of even some fully democratic countries .\n\n\n \n\nAs a Special Administrative Region of China , a socialist country\nthat rejects Western-style democratic government , Hong Kong  ' s advance\ntowards full democracy will always be subject to the dictates of Beijing .\n\n\n \n\nBut the point that must be borne in mind is that the Basic Law\nhas already promised Hong Kong will ultimately have a chief executive and all\nmembers of its legislature elected by universal suffrage . \n\n \n\nSo the issue should not be a matter of whether but when Hong Kong\nwill have full democracy . \n\n \n\nMr Qian has indicated that Hong Kong  ' s political development\ncannot be divorced from that of the mainland . \n\n \n\nSo Hong Kong , as a small part of China , is being asked to slow\ndown its political development in the interest of the whole country . \n\n \n\nThis is an issue on which the views of the people of Hong Kong\nshould be taken into consideration .\n\n\nMr Qian  ' s remarks should spark a healthy debate . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Decision on right track  \n\n \n\nEastern New Territories commuters look to be the biggest winners\nfrom the decision to award the Sha Tin-Central rail line to the\nKowloon-Canton Railway Corporation .\n\n\nMost can look forward to an uninterrupted journey without\ntime-wasting and stressful station changes . \n\n \n\nThe decision is a victory for sensible transport planning and\nlooks to be the first step in a much bigger shake-up .\n\n\nMerging the Mass Transit Railway Corporation and the KCRC makes\noperational and financial sense . It should stop pointless bickering that has\ntypified the decision on which operator should get the cross-harbour rail\nlink . \n\n \n\nIt is a pity the Government did not consider the merger option\nwhen it privatised the MTRC two years ago .\n\n\nMore than 500,000 shareholders bought into an urban metro with large\nproperty interests .\n\n\nIf merged with the KCRC , they will own something much bigger .\n\n\nIt must be assumed this will leave MTRC shareholders no worse off\nthan before .\n\n\nBut until more details are provided huge uncertainty prevails . \n\n \n\nThat the decision to grant the Sha Tin-Central link to the KCRC\nwas influenced by its lack of reliance on property income is to be welcomed .\n\n\nLast week , the Government announced that rail companies would\nreceive less land grants in future .\n\n\nThat means alternative funding mechanisms must be considered if\nprojects are to earn a commercial return . \n\n \n\nFears of reduced competition will inevitably be cited as\nreasons not to merge the two firms .\n\n\nThey may not compete directly due to their geographic separation\nbut awarding the Sha Tin-Central link would have offered travellers a choice\nof routes .\n\n\nSo long as a sensible fare-setting mechanism is adopted such issues\ncan be overcome .\n\n\nIt should involve a mechanistic approach based on inflation and\nproductivity measures of the new firm .\n\n\nDe-politicising the issue of fares would go a long way to assuage\nboth passengers and investors concerns . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Misplaced fears  \n\n \n\nThe starting point of discussion on Hong Kong  ' s political\ndevelopment must be the Basic Law  ' s stipulation that the SAR will ultimately\nhave a chief executive and all members of its legislature elected by\nuniversal suffrage . \n\n \n\nAs the  South China Morning Post  pointed out in its\neditorial yesterday , the issue is not whether , but when , Hong Kong people\nshould be allowed to choose their leaders through the ballot boxes . \n\n \n\nHong Kong already has a free press , an independent judiciary ,\nthe rule of law , and a largely clean and corruption-free civil service , i.e .\nall the elements of a liberal democracy .\n\n\nThe only missing , and arguably most important , element is an\nelectoral arrangement that allows the people to choose their favourite\ncandidates to run the government . \n\n \n\nIn his interview with the  Post  , Vice-Premier Qian\nQichen expressed the central Government  ' s desire for Hong Kong to proceed\nslowly towards the goal of universal suffrage , hinting that the SAR should\nnot go too far ahead of the mainland in terms of political development . \n\n \n\nBut we would argue that under the policy of \" one country\n, two systems\" , Beijing has already allowed Hong Kong to operate under a\ndifferent set of social , political and economic systems , namely capitalism .\n\n\n \n\nA liberal democracy with an electoral system based on universal\nsuffrage is part and parcel of capitalism , and an essential element of its\nelaborate mechanism of checks and balances . \n\n \n\nAt the heart of Beijing  ' s concern is that universal suffrage\nmay lead to political instability and make Hong Kong ungovernable .\n\n\nIt is also clearly worried that it may have to deal with a chief\nexecutive whose political views it finds unacceptable . \n\n \n\nBut Hong Kong people are a pragmatic lot .\n\n\nThey are sophisticated and mature enough to see where their best\ninterests lie .\n\n\nWe do not see how they would possibly elect a chief executive or\nlegislators who advocate independence for Hong Kong or the downfall of\ncommunism in China .\n\n\nNor would the strict perimeters laid down in the Basic Law allow\nanyone with those thoughts to put them into action .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d053add1-d2ec-4f69-a7ac-08289b4a7f47", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.858749+00:00"}

Jung , in  The Archetypes and the Collective\nUnconscious  , extends Freud  ' s personal unconscious to collective\nunconscious , male and female sexual symbols to archetypes .\n\n\nIn  Dreams  , he insists that dreams , besides having a\nregressive cause , have a progressive purpose , not just as wish fulfilments\n, but also with compensatory and corrective functions .\n\n\nFor him , \"  the symbol in the dream has more the value\nof a parable : it does not conceal , it teaches  \" ( 32\n) .\n\n\nWhat was forgotten at the moment or what was repressed in the past\nreturns to consciousness in dreams , helping men to re-gain the balance of a\nhealthy mind .\n\n\nLiterature , like myth , represents a corrective and collective\narchetypal dream . \n\n \n\nWhen Jacques Lacan calls for \"  the return to Freud\n \" (  &EACUTE;crits  : 57 ) , he means\nto return to Freud  ' s representation of the unconscious .\n\n\nIn  The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-analysis  , he\nre-defines the Freudian unconscious as a regressive desire , aiming at a\nre-union with the primordial ( m)Other .\n\n\nTraces of such a primordial union (   les\nd\u00e9rives de la jouissance   ) generate a\nprogressive chain of substitutions to fill in the lack .\n\n\nSex is understood less as an instinctual need than the desire\nof/for the Other (   le d\u00e9sir de l'Autre \n ) , ( mis)represented by the substitutive chain of\npart-objects (   objet a   ) and\nsignifiers , and then ( mis)recognized by the subject (  \nje   ) . \n\n \n\nIn Book 2 of The Seminar of Jacques Lacan , the process of\nself-(re)cognition is represented by the following schema , the so-called\nschema L :   \n\n \n\nThe subject ( S ) ( mis)recognizes itself (\nEs ) as a totalized ego ( a ) through the other  ' s\n( a ' ) gaze .\n\n\nSuch an imaginary ( mis)understanding of oneself in the Mirror Stage\nbecomes the primal scene which structures all future understandings .\n\n\nIn the Symbolic Stage , it even develops into a wall of language\nwhich blocks the unconscious message from the Other ( A ) .\n\n\nThe Other re-presents itself , yet interrupted by the other  ' s\nrepresentation .\n\n\nWhat can be understood is foreclosed by misunderstandings .\n\n\nIt is not impossible to understand .\n\n\nIt is understanding which is impossible , for understanding is always\nalready a misunderstanding (   m\u00e9connaissance\n  ) .  \n\n\nII. Representing the socio-political unconscious \n\n \n\nAs Michel Foucault tries to represent sexuality in terms of his\ngenealogical history , he aims to demonstrate that the conscious knowledge on\nsex is over-determined by the unconscious intentionality of power .\n\n\nFor him , \"  power created sexuality as a device to say\nno to sex  \" ( Gordon 190 ) .\n\n\nIn Vol. 1 of  The History of Sexuality  , he explains the\nschematic transformation of sex into the discourse of sexuality in Western\nsociety : \n\n\n Not only did it speak of sex and compel everyone to do so;\nit also set out to formulate the uniform truth of sex... .\n\n\nAs if it needed this production of truth .\n\n\nAs if it was essential that sex be inscribed not only in an economy\nof pleasure but in an ordered system of knowledge ( 69 ) .\n \n\n\nTherefore , sex is not repressed .\n\n\nIt is ( mis)represented .\n\n\nMore than being transformed in the discursive environment , it is in\nfact being translated into another language . \n\n \n\nIn \" The Order of Discourse, &rdquo; Foucault examines the\nstrategies of exclusion , rarefaction and appropriation which function as\npower apparatuses to control , select , organize and redistribute the\nproduction of discourse .\n\n\nIn the discursive field , one may see how sex is controlled and\nselected by the three great systems of exclusion : the forbidden speech , the\ndivision of madness and the will to truth &semi; organized and defined in\nterms of the principles of rarefaction : commentary-principle ,\nauthor-principle and disciplines &semi; delimited and redistributed according\nto the condition of circulation and transmission .\n\n\nIn this sense , the discourse of sexuality is not the locus for the\nunderstanding of sex , but the field where the multiplicity of power\nrelations is revealed . \n\n \n\nSimilar to Foucault , Louis Althusser  ' s history of power also\nfunctions in the form of apparatuses .\n\n\nIn his article \" Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses\n( Notes towards an Investigation ) , &rdquo; Althusser\npostulates \"  a plurality of Ideological State Apparatuses\n \" : the religious ISA , the educational ISA , the family ISA ,\nthe legal ISA , the political ISA , the trade-union ISA , the communications\nISA , the cultural ISA , etc . ( 143,144 ) .\n\n\nUnlike the State apparatus which can be experienced in tangible forms\nof repressive agencies , the Ideological State Apparatuses function\nunconsciously , being already installed and inscribed in various\ninstitutionalized social practices .\n\n\nIdeology exists and can only exist \"  in a material\nideological apparatus , prescribing material practices governed by a material\nritual  \" ( 170 ) . \n\n \n\nOf the relationship between ideology and its representation ,\n\"   ideology in general has no history  \n\" though \"  ideologies  have a history of their own\n  . &rdquo; ( 160 , 161 ) .\n\n\nMen cannot represent ideology .\n\n\nInstead , ideology is the system of representation by which \"\n men represent their real conditions of existence to themselves in an\nimaginary form  \" ( 163 ) .\n\n\nThrough an ideological mirror , individuals are constituted as\nsubjects .\n\n\nIdeology is the unconscious means of structuration by which men\n(mis)understand their world and locate themselves in society .\n\n\nYet , such an imaginary ( mis)understanding has its material bases :\n\n\n\n ( A subject  ' s ) ideas are his material\nactions inserted into material practices governed by material rituals which\nare themselves defined by the material ideological apparatus from which\nderive the ideas of that subject ( 169 ) .  \n\n\nIdeology is what cannot be represented .\n\n\nBut its material social formations ( i.e. , the ISAs )\nhave a history of their own .  \n\n\nRepresenting the historico-cultural unconscious \n\n \n\nIn  The Political Unconscious : Narrative as a Socially\nSymbolic Act  , Fredric Jameson tries to re-historicize the\nhermeneutical readings of literary works in terms of his political\nunconscious .\n\n\nHe regards the political perspective of understanding as the \"\n absolute horizon of all reading and all interpretation \n\" ( 17 ) . \n\n\nHis argument :  accordingly turns on the dynamics of the act\nof interpretation and presupposes , as its organizational fiction , that we\nnever really confront a text immediately , in all its freshness as a\nthing-in-itself .\n\n\nRather , texts come before us as the always-already-read; we\napprehend them through sedimented layers of previous interpretation , or - if\nthe text is brand-new - through the sedimented reading habits and categories\ndeveloped by those inherited interpretative traditions ( Preface : 9\n) .  \n\n\nSo to speak , a literary text embodies a cultural history of its\nunderstanding .\n\n\nThe act of reading and interpretation necessarily has to pass through\nthe traces of previous readings and interpretations .\n\n\nIn the process , a new allegorical code is established to re-write\nold traditions .\n\n\nThe struggle among theories for hermeneutical domination and mastery\nimplicates the politics involved in the history of readings and\ninterpretations . \n\n \n\nThe history of ( mis)understanding , according to Jameson ,\nsignifies the cultural repression of a collective Story :  \n\n\n\" for Marxism , the collective struggle to wrest a realm of\nFreedom from a realm of Necessity &rdquo; ( 19 ) . \n\n\n\nTo detect \"  the traces of that uninterrupted narrative\n \" and to restore \"  to the surface of the text\nthe repressed and buried reality of this fundamental history  \"\n( 20 ) , a Marxist perspective of political readings has to be\nadopted .\n\n\nA literary text must be located within a three-layered hermeneutical\nframework so that its \"  repressed and buried  \"\ncultural unconscious can re-present itself in different horizons of\nunderstandings : \n\n\n (F)irst , of political history , in the narrow\nsense of punctual event and a chroniclelike sequence of happenings in time;\nthen of society , in the now already less diachronic and time-bound sense of\na constitutive tension and struggle between social classes; and , ultimately\n, of history now conceived in its vastest sense of the sequence of modes of\nproduction and the succession and destiny of the various human social\nformations , from prehistoric life to whatever for future history has in\nstore for us ( 75 ) .  \n\n\nThe focus of study in the three layers of concentric horizons can be\nsummarized as the historical or ideological subtext , the social \nideologeme  and the ideology of form . \n\n \n\nIn the horizon of political history , history is narrowly defined\nas political events or haphazard happenings represented in chronological\norder .\n\n\nIt is not the general background against which a literary work is\nwritten , but an ideologically-informed textualized reality which a literary\nwork actively transforms and re-writes .\n\n\nTherefore , during interpretations , \"  the individual\nwork is grasped essentially as a symbolic act  \" ( 76\n) .\n\n\nIt reconstructs \"  a prior historical or ideological\nsubtext  \" ( 81 and provides \"  symbolic\nresolutions of real political and social contradictions  \"\n( 80 ) .\n\n\nThe text re-writes its subtext in the same way as interpretation\nre-writes the text .\n\n\nIt both enacts and represses irreconcilable political and social\ncontradictions inherent in its historical and ideological subtext . \n\n \n\nIn the social horizon , the individual text has to be interpreted\nand re-written as a class discourse .\n\n\nThe textualized presence of a single voice pre-supposes an entire\nsystem of representation for its understanding .\n\n\nIf the individual text is a   parole   ,\nthen the discursive social context will be its   langue\n  .\n\n\nThey are relational and dialogic , if not oppositional and\nantagonistic . \n\n\nDeveloping his theory from Karl Marx and Mikhail Bakhtin instead of\nFerdinand de Saussure or Roman Jakobson , Jameson claims that : \n( I ) t will be necessary to add the qualification that the\nnormal form of the dialogical is essentially and antagonistic one , and that\nthe dialogues of class struggle is one in which two opposing discourses fight\nit out within the general unity of a shared code ( 84 ) . \n\n\n\nThe text is the field of class struggle , between the hegemonic sound\nand its repressed silence , or between the network of domination and its\nmarginalized resistance . \n\n \n\n\nThe minimal unit for the larger class discourse is what Jameson\ncalls ideologeme , which  manifest(s ) itself either\nas a pseudoidea - a conceptual or belief system , an abstract value , an\nopinion or prejudice - Or as a protonarrative , a kind of ultimate class\nfantasy about the collective characters ' which are the classes in opposition\n(  87 ) . \n\n\nIn other words ,  ideologemes  are the units of ideological\nrepresentation by which one ( mis)understands the collective\ncharacters of one  ' s own class .\n\n\nThey are fundamentally narrative in character , having their \"\n capacity to mediate between conceptions of ideology as abstract\nopinion , class value , and the like  \" ( 87 )\nand their concrete protonarrative manifestations . \n\n \n\nIn the ultimate horizon of History , the literary text as\nembedded within a larger socio-cultural process is re-considered in terms of\nconflicting modes of productions .\n\n\nJameson  ' s notion of the mode of production does not follow that of\nthe diachronic succession of modes : \n\n\n Primitive communism or tribal society ( the horde\n) , the gens or hierarchical kinship societies ( neolithic\nsociety ) , the Asiatic mode of production ( so-called Oriental\ndespotism ) , the polis or an oligarchical slaveholding society\n( the ancient mode of production ) , feudalism , capitalism ,\nand communism ( 89 ) .  \n\n\nNor does is resemble that of Poulantzas  '  synchronic \" \ncoexistence of several modes of production all at once  \"\n( 95 ) .\n\n\nInstead , what is synchronic has to open to history in a dialectical\nway while what is diachronic has to be re-considered in a synchronic or\nmetasynchronic manner .\n\n\nThe individual text is \"  crisscrossed and intersected\nby a variety of impulses from contradictory modes of cultural production all\nat once  \" ( 95 ) .\n\n\nIt re-presents the historical juncture of simultaneous conflicting\nmotives among different modes of cultural productions . \n\n \n\nHere , Jameson proposes his concept of cultural revolution as\nthe \"  moment in which the coexistence of various modes of\nproduction becomes visibly antagonistic , their contradictions moving to the\nvery center of political , social , and historical life  ( 95\n) .\n\n\nIt marks the juncture of competition between the dominant mode of\nproduction with sedimented layers of archaic structures and emergent means of\nnew productive schemes .\n\n\nIn the ultimate horizon of historical Necessity , both the subtexts\nand the ideologemes have to be understood in an enlarged socio-cultural\nscheme as the ideology of form , which refers to \"  the\ndeterminate contradiction of the specific messages emitted by the varied sign\nsystems  ( 98 ) ... \"  which are\nthemselves traces or anticipations of modes of production  \"\n( 76 ) .\n\n\nHistory in the sense of a collective human struggle and as a process\nof socio-cultural contradictions becomes the ultimate possibility for human\nunderstandings .  \n\n\nIV. On unconscious : from psycho-somatic to\nsocio-political/historico-cultural representations .\n\n\n\n\n \n\nFrom Sigmund Freud to Fredric Jameson , one can see the shrift\nthe focus in the representation of the unconscious from an individual  ' s\nrepressed psyche to a collective being  ' s repressed History .\n\n\nWhat was originally understood as the symbolic dream of a family\nromance becomes a discursive field of political conflicts and ideological\nstruggles in society .\n\n\nThe notion of an individual text develops from being the manifest\ncontent of some latent dream-thoughts to the historical and cultural dialogue\nbetween an articulated discourse and its repressed silence .\n\n\nTextual interpretations also change from the psychiatric attention\npaid to the hidden level of meaning beneath the text to the critical\nawareness of sedimented layers of larger socio-cultural processes which\nenvelop and encompass the text . \n\n \n\nTo represent the unconscious means to re-construct a history for\nwhat is outside history .\n\n\nOne has to rely on the adequacy and validity of language which in\nitself is neither adequate as a medium of representation nor valid as a\ndocumentation of truth .\n\n\nThe history of understanding is in fact a Story of misunderstandings .\n\n\nIf the test of the psycho-linguistic Labyrinth is that one can only\nunderstand through misunderstandings , it is also the outlet which History\nfinds its way out .\n\n\nThe unconscious is what cannot be represented .\n\n\nBut in the mirror of language , History re-presents itself as the\nOther , out of whatever misguided and disguised form of imaginary\nrepresentations in the process of cultural disseminations .\n\n\nOnly in the possibility of the socio-cultural contexts can one\nexperience the impossibility of the individual text .\n\n\nThe moment of aporia is also the moment when consciousness\nencounters its unconscious self .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "0d66a1e0-b126-4a66-bd23-f9ed9dbf6058", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.860174+00:00"}

he\nsaid .\n\n\nHe shared this idea with his three friends , Bernard Chung Chi-shing\n, John Lau Kwok-wai and Nelson Kwan Chun-fai .\n\n\nThe four have known each other since attending the University of\nAdelaide in Australia together . \n\n \n\nThey decided to compile a list of all the infected areas on the\nInternet so their friends and relatives would know which areas of Hong Kong\nto avoid . \n\n \n\n\" We thought the easiest way for an individual to protect\nthemselves was to avoid some of the dangerous areas .\n\n\nWe tried to figure out where these places are but we couldn't find\nthem , they were not available on the government Web site , &rdquo; explained\nMr Chung . \n\n \n\nThe four agreed to name the Web site , www.sosick.org . \n\n \n\nMr Chan had registered the site name more than a year ago , well\nbefore the Sars outbreak - but had no particular plan in mind .\n\n\nAt the time , he had no idea how appropriate the name would become ,\nor how useful the site could be . \n\n \n\nHe explained that the inspiration for the name came from the\nnorthern Song dynasty poet Su Shi ( 1037-1101 ) .\n\n\nThe pronunciation of the poet  ' s name in Cantonese sounds like ` so\nsick ' in English . \n\n \n\n\" The name struck me and I just found it interesting that\nthe poet  ' s name , if translated into English , has that meaning , so I\nregistered a Web site under this name , just for fun , &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\nThe four friends started gathering all available information on\ninfected buildings and posting it on the www.sosick.org site . \n\n \n\n\" In the beginning , we just had Amoy Gardens and Sha Tin .\n\n\nSome of the information was from newspapers , some were from friends\n, &rdquo; said Mr Chung . \n\n \n\nBut word soon spread and it became clear that the site was\nmeeting a public need .\n\n\nWithin two days , the hit rate on the site climbed to more than\n100,000 and the e-mails the four received increased from a few in the\nbeginning to more than 100 a day .\n\n\nOnly then did they begin to realise that their circle of family and\nfriends were not the only people visiting the site .\n\n\nOn April 10 , just before the government announced it would release\nthe name of the infected buildings , sosick recorded a hit rate of more than\n200,000 .\n\n\nThe number of e-mails the four received over that period also rose\nfrom 100 a day to more than 1,000 . \n\n \n\n\" Most of them were telling us which buildings had\nresidents who had been infected , some were thank you letters or letter of\nencouragement , &rdquo; said Mr Chung . \n\n \n\nThe Web site recorded the spread of Sars from Amoy Gardens to the\nnearby Lower Ngau Tau Kok Estate a week before this became generally known .\n\n\n \n\nThe site  ' s popularity was matched by its credibility .\n\n\nIt not only informed the public by revealing a list of infected\nbuildings , those compiling the information took steps to ensure it was\naccurate . \n\n \n\nAll those who provided information were asked to attach with\ntheir e-mails either newspaper articles , which clearly publicised the names\nof the infected buildings , or letters issued by the Department of Health to\nthe estates ' management about people on an estate being infected with Sars .\n\n\n \n\nThen the four engineers would call a building  ' s estate\nmanagement for confirmation .\n\n\nOnly after all the steps had been completed and the information was\nconfirmed as being correct would the name of the infected building be\nuploaded to the Web . \n\n \n\n\" We were never rejected when we called the estate\nmanagement for confirmation .\n\n\nPeople were pretty helpful in response to our queries , &rdquo; said\nMr Chung . \n\n \n\nIn fact , it was a mistake that made them realise the importance\nof obtaining proof and cross-checking the information they received .\n\n\nEarly on , they placed the name of a commercial building in Mongkok\non the Web , stating that somebody working there was infected .\n\n\nBut shortly afterwards , they received a complaint from the\nmanagement of the building , telling them this was incorrect . \n\n \n\nCompleting all the steps from clearing e-mails to updating the\naddress list meant each of the four needed to work five to six hours every\nnight after they returned home from work . \n\n \n\nSince the government began producing detailed lists , sosick has\nnot been updating its information . \n\n \n\n\" I am glad we don't have to do the update any more .\n\n\nFive to six hours is a lot of work , &rdquo; said Mr Chung .\n\n\n\" Imagine , I am usually home around eight and since I live\nalone , I have to cook and eat first . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nIt never occurred to the group to attempt to make money out of\nthe site . \n\n \n\n\" All the information is on the Web , anyone can copy it if\nthey want .\n\n\nWe own no right over the information .\n\n\nThis is public information .\n\n\nIt is available to the public anyway .\n\n\nAnyone in an infected building can see the government notice in the\nlift lobby .\n\n\nIt was just that the government was not putting it together,' ' said\nMr Chung . \n\n \n\nThe team behind sosick was aware of the need not to breach people\n's privacy .\n\n\nOnly the names of infected buildings are posted on the site , not the\naffected floor , or the precise address of victims . \n\n \n\nEven though sosick has now stopped updating its list , and the\ngovernment is publishing up-to-date information , the site remains popular\nand continues to receive 30,000 hits a day .  \n\n \n\n\n Sars fears see rise in audio and video conferencing \n \n\n\n Ben Kwok  \n\n \n\nMainland and Hong Kong telecommunications firms offering video\nand audio teleconferencing are hoping to boost traffic growth as a result of\nthe Sars crisis . \n\n \n\nAsiaInfo Holdings , a Nasdaq-listed company that provides network\nand server solutions to China Unicom , said it expected a turnaround in its\nbusiness fortunes on the back of rising demand for video conferencing and\nother telecommunications services . \n\n \n\n\" Some of our customers did indicate that their video\nconference demand is increasing , most likely due to the reduction in travel\nand the caution , &rdquo; chairman James Ding told a group of investors .\n\n\n \n\nAudio rather than video conferencing is proving popular due to\ncost advantages . \n\n \n\nIndustry executives said an hour-long video would cost between\nHK&dollar;80,000 and HK&dollar;100,000 , while audio cost a few thousand\ndollars per hour . \n\n \n\nWharf T&T vice-president Tony Cheung Tung-lan said audio\nconferencing sales had risen 35 per cent since the outbreak of Sars in Hong\nKong . \n\n \n\nPopular conferencing locations include the United States ,\nBritain , Singapore and China . \n\n \n\n\" We expect audio conferencing traffic to grow , given that\nChina announced it would cancel the Golden Holiday as the Sars impact widens\n, &rdquo; Mr Cheung said . \n\n \n\nMr Cheung said Wharf ranked No 2 in audio conferencing in Hong\nKong , behind MCI in a market size estimated at HK&dollar;100 million . \n\n \n\nPCCW , which provides both audio and video conferencing , said it\nhad also observed an increase in inquiries for the service .  \n\n\n\n\n  Sunday to offer more location alert services after Sars\nsuccess  \n\n\n\n Sunday Communications plans to add more location-based services (\nLBS ) , claiming that alerts indicating when a mobile-phone user is in\nthe vicinity of a Sars-affected building have spurred interest in such\nofferings . \n\n\n\n Sunday executive director Henry Wong said: \" Sars raised the\nawareness of public safety , and in this process LBS has played an important\nrole . &rdquo; Sunday launched the first Sars-related service by identifying\nvirus-affected buildings within a kilometre of a customer , a service that\nit claimed was a hit . \n\n\n\n Since launching mobile data services , Hong Kong operators have struggled\nto find a so-called \" killer app &rdquo;

{"text": "Investors beware  \n\n \n\nThe Securities and Futures Commission wants to tighten up the\nregulations over research done by stock market analysts .\n\n\nWithout giving precise details , it is saying it will watch how other\nmarkets deal with the issue , before deciding what is appropriate in Hong\nKong . \n\n \n\nThe charge sheet some analysts face is that , through poor\nresearch , they inflated a stock market bubble in the late 1990s by\nrecommending people buy shares in companies which had no prospect of making a\nprofit . \n\n \n\nWhen the stock market bubble burst , the shares collapsed , and\ninvestors were left nursing huge losses .\n\n\nA more serious charge is that analysts working for big investment\nbanks actively promoted stocks they knew to be bad , in the hope of gaining\nlucrative deals from that company for their employers . \n\n \n\nCountries around the world are now grappling with how to deal with\nthis issue .\n\n\nIdeas that have been floated include ordering banks to separate their\nresearch arms and toughening up the penalties for those found guilty of\nmarket abuse . \n\n \n\nAll the proposed remedies are worth examining , both in Hong Kong\nand elsewhere , but there is something else that is probably more important .\n\n\n \n\nToo many people were too willing to believe that the rules of\neconomics , particularly as they related to company performance , had been\nrewritten .\n\n\nA firm did not need to be making a profit , or even have a sound\nbusiness plan it seemed , it just needed a vague idea about future earnings\nand a trendy name . \n\n \n\nIt wasn't that there were a lack of signals about a bubble in the\nmaking .\n\n\nIt wasn't just Alan Greenspan warning about an \" irrational\nexuberance &rdquo; in share prices .\n\n\nThe frenzied scenes that greeted the Tom.com share offering in early\n2000 should have warned investors to beware . \n\n \n\nWhile regulating analysts may be important , investors also need\nto look at their own behaviour if they are not to get burned again .\n\n\nThey should look at the hard facts behind a company , look closely at\nits quality of management , track record , and future plans .\n\n\nDon't be taken in by a flash name , or a gimmicky marketing ploy .\n\n\nAnd beware what a company says about itself . If a deal looks too\ngood to be true , it probably is . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Make peace , not fear  \n\n \n\nUS President George W . Bush  ' s administration did not say so ,\nbut the test-firing of an interceptor rocket from a navy ship in the Pacific\nhours after the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty expired was a warning . It was\nAmerican defiance speaking , telling China and Russia by actions rather than\nwords of Washington  ' s military ambitions . \n\n \n\nThe words have not been so blunt to China , but neither have they\nbeen comforting .\n\n\nMr Bush says that American defence is his Government  ' s priority and\nit will go ahead with building a missile defence shield regardless of\nprotests . \n\n \n\nOnly last month in Moscow , Mr Bush told Russia  ' s President\nVladimir Putin of US friendship and signed a pact that jointly mothballed\nthousands of nuclear warheads . \n\n \n\nThe US withdrew from the 1972 missile pact to enable construction\nof the missile shield .\n\n\nIt claimed the end of the Cold War meant that priorities had changed .\n\n\n \n\nWork begins on the shield today with a ground-breaking ceremony\nwill be held at Fort Greely in Alaska for silos for six interceptor missiles .\n\n\nBut it is not simply a shield - with missiles pointed across the\nPacific towards China , Russia and North Korea , it is as much a threat as a\ndeterrent . \n\n \n\nThe ABM Treaty was seen as a key element of global arms control .\n\n\nIts death opens a new era of uncertainty .\n\n\nMilitary experts say China is strengthening its missile defences .\n\n\n \n\nWashington and Beijing have an obligation to not endanger world\nsecurity .\n\n\nThey must make an effort to build better relations and resolve\ndifferences rather than create fear . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Tale of two cities  \n\n \n\nTiny Macau has been dependent on the gaming industry for survival\n, but its new ambition is to become a regional convention , entertainment and\ngaming centre . \n\n \n\nAfter luring international consortiums to set up new hotels ,\ncasinos and conference facilities , it is also trying to enhance its\nattractions by building a few golf courses . \n\n \n\nBut as it can find no suitable sites within its borders , it\nwants to build them on Hengqin Island in neighbouring Zhuhai .\n\n\nTo ensure the golf courses become \" part &rdquo; of Macau , it\nhas even asked the central Government to allow foreign tourists from the\nenclave visa-free access to the island . \n\n \n\nThat Macau Chief Executive Edmund Ho Hau-wah has disclosed the\nplan to a delegation of foreign chambers of commerce suggested that it stands\na good chance of being approved by Beijing .\n\n\nThere are in fact precedents for such approvals .\n\n\nSince 1995 , Shenzhen has benefited by allowing visa-free access for\nthree-days for foreign tourists entering in groups through Hong Kong . \n\n \n\nThe flexibility demonstrated by both Macau and Zhuhai in\ncomplementing one another is a shining example of regional co-operation .\n\n\nZhuhai has even dovetailed with Macau  ' s goal by aiming to become\nChina  ' s \" most romantic city\" . \n\n \n\nPerhaps the precarious situation faced by Zhuhai , which is being\nweighed down by the financial burden of having to pay for an airport that has\nattracted no traffic , means it is receptive to any offers from Macau to\nbring in more investment . \n\n \n\nAs two small territories whose significance is dwarfed by Hong\nKong and Shenzhen on the other side of the Pearl River estuary , Macau and\nZhuhai know they must work hand in hand to help one another . \n\n \n\nCommentators have pointed to the focused way in which Macau has\nset its course compared to Hong Kong  ' s apparent lack of a clear direction .\n\n\nBut that view overlooks the differences between the two Special\nAdministrative Regions of China . \n\n \n\nWhereas Macau has a population of just 430,000 and is only 23.8\nsquare kilometres in size , Hong Kong has 6.8 million souls and a land area\nof more than 1,000 square kilometres . \n\n \n\nIt will always be easier to run Macau than Hong Kong , although\nboth face the same problem of staying ahead of other Chinese cities as the\nadvantages that they used to enjoy due to their colonial legacies are fast\neroding with China opening up more and more to the outside world . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Making amends  \n\n \n\nSouth Korean President Kim Dae-jung  ' s \" Sunshine Policy\n&rdquo; for peace with the rival North may be on its last legs , but that\ndoes not mean the future is bleak .\n\n\nIn fact , rarely has the prospect for a chance for peace on the\nKorean peninsula been so positive . \n\n \n\nKey to the new atmosphere is a change of heart by the United\nStates .\n\n\nWhen President George W . Bush took office in January 2001 , years of\nprogress evaporated .\n\n\nUS-North Korean talks were cancelled and Mr Bush  ' s tough rhetoric\nculminated in him naming North Korea among an \" axis of evil nations\" .\n\n\n \n\nLast Thursday , Mr Kim  ' s ruling Millennium Democratic Party was\ntrounced by the opposition Grand National Party in local government elections .\n\n\nAlthough Mr Kim cannot stand for re-election in presidential polls in\nOctober , the result was a pointed reminder that his plan for Korean unity\nwould die when he left office . \n\n \n\nBut talks the same day between Pyongyang  ' s United Nations\nrepresentative and US special envoy in negotiations on North Korea , Jack\nPritchard , brought fresh hope .\n\n\nThere is now talk of Washington sending an envoy to Pyongyang . \n\n \n\nShortly after a ground-breaking visit to Pyongyang by Mr Kim  ' s\nspecial envoy , the North  ' s leader Kim Jong-il spoke positively of a\npromised visit to Seoul .\n\n\nReunions of families split by the Korean War have resumed .\n\n\nThere is even a chance of an inter-Korean football match . \n\n \n\nThe signs are positive , but the US - more than any other nation\n- can effect real change .\n\n\nIt is up to Mr Bush and his advisers to diplomatically re-ignite the\nprocess that for 18 months they have so woefully mismanaged . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Hope on the horizon  \n\n \n\nFrom 4.4 per cent at the end of 2000 , the unemployment rate has\nrisen to a record high of 7.4 per cent over the past 18 months , with 253,000\npeople now out of work . \n\n \n\nWith tens of thousands of graduates and school leavers due to\nflood the job market this summer , Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa has had to\nadmit that unemployment might go even higher before it falls . \n\n \n\nIt did not help that one of Hong Kong  ' s oldest restaurant chains\n, the Treasure Restaurant Group , collapsed under a mountain of debt early\nthis month .\n\n\nThe chain  ' s restaurants used to employ almost 2,000 workers , and\ntheir closure has affected general sentiment . \n\n \n\nBut although it is difficult for anyone to shrug off the gloomy\nmood that pervades the community , there are reasons to suggest things are\nnot as bad as they look . \n\n \n\nAlthough property prices are still sluggish due to a massive\nover-supply , an increasing number of people are moving into new homes sold\nand financed at attractive rates by developers and banks . \n\n \n\nAnd new homes need to be furnished and decorated .\n\n\nThat probably explained why employment in the decoration and\nmaintenance sector has bucked the trend and shown a real increase . \n\n \n\nThe latest figures have also revealed that more jobs have been\ncreated in the financial and business services sectors , suggesting that\nafter almost four years of continuous deflation , these areas are showing\nsigns of vitality again . \n\n \n\nGrowing job vacancies in these sectors appear to be collaborated\nby slight growth in recruitment advertising over the past six months . \n\n \n\nTwo weeks ago , the Government announced the resumption of the\nsale of Home Ownership Scheme flats after a 10-month ban , but at much\nreduced numbers .\n\n\nThe reduction should help stabilise the housing market . \n\n \n\nAlthough the results of yesterday  ' s land auction could not be\nregarded as a definitive indicator that the worst is over , the keen interest\nshown by developers at the North Point site suggested they are cautiously\noptimistic about the future . \n\n \n\nTwo months ago , the Asian Development Bank forecast that Hong\nKong would register 2.1 per cent growth this year , followed by a strong 4.8\nper cent in 2003 .\n\n\nIts forecast was more upbeat than the Government's . \n\n \n\nEven if the bank is off target by a margin , Hong Kong should\nstill record growth this year .\n\n\nNo dramatic developments seem to be on the horizon to cause the bank\nand other economists to revise their predictions . \n\n \n\nDespite the downturn , the balances in people  ' s savings accounts\nhave continued to grow .\n\n\nWhat they lack is the confidence to spend the cash they have hoarded .\n\n\nHopefully , confidence will return as rising tourist arrivals and a\nstabilising housing market gradually translate into more jobs . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Aerial objective  \n\n \n\nIn whose best interests is an expanded air services agreement\nwith the United States being negotiated ?\n\n\nWith SAR officials widely expected to seal a deal in Washington next\nweek , a furious last-ditch lobbying effort is under way .\n\n\nThe betting is that Cathay Pacific secures its long-planned alliance\nwith American Airlines , while US cargo carriers win significantly expanded\noperating rights from the SAR . \n\n \n\nFor opponents , the SAR Government is giving away too much to\nsecure a deal that chiefly benefits British-controlled Cathay .\n\n\nWorse , China  ' s national interests are threatened by throwing open\nthe SAR cargo-hub market to US freight carriers , argues the China National\nAviation Corp . (  CNAC ) . \n\n \n\nAir service agreements are always wrapped in national politics\nand Hong Kong  ' s situation is complicated by its SAR status within China .\n\n\nBy seeking to impose a pro-China outcome , critics charge CNAC is\nundermining Hong Kong  ' s independence under the \" one country , two systems\n&rdquo; formula . \n\n \n\nSuch concerns seem unfounded since this spat seems a straight\nbattle of corporate self-interest .\n\n\nCNAC  ' s lobbying effort , which has included fiery rhetoric from\nCitic Pacific chairman Larry Yung Chi-kin , is little different from US\ncarriers ' influence-pedalling in Washington .\n\n\nThe test will be whether local officials do a deal which is best for\nHong Kong . \n\n \n\nCNAC hopes to develop its 43.3 per cent-held Dragonair\nsubsidiary as a major Trans-Pacific freight carrier .\n\n\nExpanding US cargo airlines ' ability to pick up cargo in the SAR and\nfly to other destinations threatens that aim .\n\n\nHowever , it promises to consolidate Hong Kong  ' s status as a major\nair-cargo hub . \n\n \n\nWe have supported a full opening of all air routes since the\nwider economy of Hong Kong has little to lose and much to gain from more\ncompetition , lower fares and consolidation as an air cargo hub .\n\n\nSingapore has already gone this route . The counter argument that\nthis leaves Hong Kong little leverage to force an opening of the US domestic\naviation market makes sense from Cathay  ' s perspective but not for the rest\nof us . \n\n \n\nWe seem likely to have a compromise that offers simplified US\ntravel through the Cathay-American Airlines code-share agreement , but a\nlimited increase in competition .\n\n\nThat is not a perfect solution , but a step in the right direction .\nDragonair retains a large market flying cargo to Chek Lap Kok and has\nregional expansion plans .\n\n\nThe main aim must be to get more people and goods flowing through\nthe SAR .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "5ede880a-32bd-4fc3-9179-5a04569dce4f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.864074+00:00"}
{"text": "2. Anthropology and Christology in Christian-Confucian Dialogue \n\n \n\nAnthropology and Christology are two closely related issues in\nConfucian-Christian dialogue .\n\n\nThis can be seen in the six issues raised in the Confucian-Christian\ndialogue among Tsai Jen-hou , Ch'ou Lien-hua , Liang Yen-cheng ( Leung\nIn-shing ) in 1981 .\n\n\nTsai , a representative of contemporary Confucianism , suggests that ,\nin Confucianism , all human beings can become sages potentially , while it is\ndifficult for Christianity to adopt the idea that \" all human beings\ncan become Christ &rdquo; .\n\n\nTsai argues that in principle the union between Christ and the human\nbeing is significantly different from the unity of Heaven and humanity .\n\n\nWhile the former is a kind of subject (  God)-object ( human\n) relationship , the latter is possible only by human effort , which\nis grounded in human subjectivity .\n\n\nTherefore , even though Christianity can make the claim that all human\nbeings can become Christ , its meaning is not equivalent to \" all human\nbeings can become sage and real man &rdquo; in Confucianism .\n\n\nThe second question raised by Tsai is whether Jesus is human or divine\n, a strictly Christological question .\n\n\nAccording to Tsai , in Christianity , the divinity of Jesus Christ is\nhighly emphasized so much so that Jesus  '  way of \" from human to divine\n&rdquo; is overlooked .\n\n\nTsai suggests that if Christianity is able to recognize the approach\nof \" Christology from below &rdquo; , there will be a significant\ncommon ground between Christianity and Confucianism . \n\n \n\nTwo important observations have to be made with regard to Tsai  ' s\nsuggestion .\n\n\nFirstly , Tsai does not refute the divinity of Jesus .\n\n\nHe admits that \" from-divine-to-human &rdquo; and \"\nfrom-human-to-divine &rdquo; are two sides of the same coin .\n\n\nThe integration of these two perspectives can form a more\ncomprehensive picture of the person of Jesus Christ .\n\n\nSecondly , Tsai contends that Jesus  '  way of \" from human to\ndivine &rdquo; and the Confucian way of \" all human being can become\nsage &rdquo; will form a ground for dialogue .\n\n\nFor Tsai , both Jesus and Confucius can be considered as human beings\nwho had undergone a process of \" from finite to infinite &rdquo;\nthrough their obedience and self-cultivation respectively .\n\n\nIn this case , there is an ontological ground to talk about \"\nall human beings can become Christ . &rdquo;\n\n\nThe model of \" Christology from below &rdquo; entails that\nJesus , like all other human beings , lived as a normal human being and\nexemplifies the way of \" from finite to infinite &rdquo; .\n\n\nWe can clearly see that Christology and anthropology are the two\nfundamental and closely related loci of the Christian-Confucian dialogue .\n\n\n \n\nAnthropology has long been regarded as a crucial issue in\nConfucian-Christian dialogue .\n\n\nIn her book Confucianism and Christianity ( 1977 ) ,\nJulia Ching suggests that there are some basic differences between these two\nreligions .\n\n\nFirstly , while Confucianism focuses more upon human perfectibility ,\nChristianity tends to stress human fallibility .\n\n\nSecondly , Confucianism emphasizes the harmonious relationship\nbetween human , society and the universe , while Christianity seems to\nsupport the idea of human being at war within oneself and one  ' s sinful\nnature .\n\n\nChing further suggests that where Confucian theory shows more sense\nof self-reliance , Protestant theology insists upon faith alone and exclusive\ndependence on God  ' s power .\n\n\nChing  ' s characterization of the two traditions seems to imply that\nChristianity ( especially Protestantism ) is a way of relying\non other-power and tends to focus on the negative side of human being , while\nConfucianism is a way of relying on self-power and tends to focus on the\npositive side of humanity .\n\n\nChing  ' s contrasting characterization of the two traditions may have\nover-simplified the actual case .\n\n\nActually , Confucianism also regards moral evil and the imperfect\nexistential status as both realistic conditions of humanity .\n\n\nFurthermore , Christianity also seeks for the sanctification of human\nbeing and it does not negate the crucial role of human effort in the process\nof attaining perfection even though the importance of human faith and\nreliance on a transcendent God is stressed .\n\n\nAs Au Kin-ming  ' s comparative study of the understanding of human\ncondition by Chu Hsi and that of Paul Tillich points out , both asserts the\noriginal goodness of human nature , which is the potential nature of human\nbeing prior to its existence .\n\n\nMoreover , both assert the distinction or polarity between the\noriginal nature and the existential nature or condition .\n\n\nThis polarity is one of the major keys to understanding human\nselfishness and sinfulness .\n\n\nIn this respect , there are dissimilarities as well as similarities\nbetween the Christian and Confucian understanding of humanity .\n\n\nIn short they are not incommensurable or inevitable contradicting\neach other .\n\n\nHowever , Ching remains quite right when she suggests that both\ntraditions have an understanding of faith in human being as openness to the\ntranscendent . \n\n \n\nAccording to Tang Yi-jie , a scholar of Chinese philosophy , in\nConfucianism , what is called immanence should refer to the innate nature of\nthe human person , that is to say , the spirit which makes a human being a\nhuman being , e.g.  jen  ( humaneness ) ; and\nwhat is called transcendence should refer to the basic of the cosmos  ' \nexistence or the ontological nature of the cosmos , that is , &lsquo; what makes\nexistence existence &rsquo; , e.g. the way of Heaven (  t'ien-tao\n  ) .\n\n\nThe idea of Unity of Heaven and Humanity , ( \nt'ien-jen-ho-i   ) in Confucianism\nmeans that the transcendence and immanence are in unity , which is the ideal\nrather than the existential state of human being .\n\n\nThe transcendence is not the Wholly Other; rather , it is immanent in\nnature .\n\n\nTherefore , the way of Heaven (  t'ien-tao   ) is itself immanently transcendent and the\nhuman nature (  jen-hsing  \n) is not only immanent , but also transcendent . \n\n \n\nThe question of anthropology in Christianity and Confucianism is\nclosely related to the problem of transcendence and immanence , which seems\nto be a divisive issue in Christian-Confucian dialogue because Christianity\nseems to assume the distinction , and even separation of them , whereas\nConfucianism holds that transcendence and immanence are united . \n\n\nAs Liu Shu-hsien puts it ,   However , this\ngeneralized picture is questioned by both the Christian and Confucian sides .\n\n\nFrom the Confucian side , Liu Shu-hsien suggests that although\nChristianity and Confucianism hold different views on the issue of\ntranscendence and immanence , they share several common points .\n\n\nFirst , based on the concept of the image of God , Christianity also\nasserts the goodness of human nature; whereas , it is mistaken to say that\nConfucianism is optimistic on the perfection of human being .\n\n\nSecond , Confucianism holds that &rdquo;  it is a long and\narduous way for scholars to follow the steps of sages and worthies \n&rdquo; .\n\n\nThat means there is a tension between the ideal and the existential\nstate of human being . \n\n\n \" The Confucian ideal is one thing , the practice is\nanother. &rdquo;  \n\n\nThird , as Liu points out , Christian theology/philosophy also\nabsorbs the idea of process philosophy and humanism in order to develop their\nimmanent dimension of the transcendence . \n\n \n\nFrom the Christian side , Gerhold Becker admits that although\nboth traditions direct human being towards the ultimate , Confucianism\ndiscovers the ultimate immanent in human being whereas Christianity finds\nmeaning in the ultimate only by transcending human being and his/her world\nand by going beyond nature in the most radical sense .\n\n\nHowever , Becker qualifies that in Christian theology , the infinite\nqualitative difference between God and human would not eliminate the intimate\nrelationship between both .\n\n\nIn Christology , the ontological gap between God and human being is\nbridgeable and the redemptive act of Christ bestowed on human being me\ncapability to transform his/her life into that of ultimate harmony between\nhimself/herself and God .\n\n\nBecker further points out the so-called anthropological turn in\nmodern theology advocated by Max Scheler , Paul Tillich and Karl Rahner .\n\n\nThese Christian thinkers attempted to show that the idea of the\nultimate is entailed in human being as the ground of his/her being which\ncalls him/her beyond himself/herself towards the all-embracing mystery of God .\n\n\nLastly , Becker suggests that the transcendental idea of Christianity\nmay have the potential to develop a considerable critical function .\n\n\nCompare with Buddhism and Confucianism , this transcendental\ndimension can help Christianity to keep a distance from the world without\nrejecting it together and to be involved in the world without too much\nadjusting to it . \n\n \n\nFrom the above brief survey of the Christian-Confucian dialogue ,\nwe can find that both parties think that the contrast between Christianity\nand Confucianism are not absolute , though they have their respective views\nof human nature .\n\n\nBoth Christianity and Confucianism hold the original goodness of\nhuman nature and that the existential nature of human being is not the ideal\ncondition .\n\n\nIt is quite possible for Christianity to recognize human sinfulness\nwithout negating the original created human goodness and to interpret the\nsaving act of Jesus Christ as the restoration of the original goodness of\nhuman .\n\n\nHowever , it is noteworthy that Christology does not play an\nimportant role in the dialogue on anthropology .\n\n\nAlthough some Christian scholars attempted to base their\nanthropologies on the doctrine of Christ , the discussion about Christology\nin Confucian-Christian dialogue remains rather few .\n\n\n( At least ) , Tsai  ' s question about \"\nChristology from above or from below &rdquo; has been largely neglected .\n\n\nPrecisely at this juncture , Barth  ' s Christological anthropology may\nenrich the dialogue .  \n\n\n3. Karl Barth  ' s Anthropology : \" Real Man &rdquo; and \"\nReal Humanity &rdquo;  \n\n\n3.1 Jesus Christ as the Starting Point \n\n \n\nFor Barth , the inquiry concerning human nature necessarily\ninvolves the fundamental methodological question of the proper approach to\ndeal with the problem of humanity .\n\n\nIn the section \" Phenomena of the Human &rdquo; , Barth\nsuggests that since all the findings of the self-understanding of human being\nconcern only the \" phenomena &rdquo; which are \" neutral ,\nrelative and ambiguous &rdquo; , the result of any self-interpretation of\nhuman beings is only a \" vicious circle &rdquo; because there is no\npoint of reference which is outside human being to interpret themselves .\n\n\nIn another place , Barth further suggests that a true understanding\nof human being can be attained not from human self-understanding , but from\nJesus Christ , the real human being .\n\n\nThis important passage is worth quoting in full for it provides the\nkey to the following discussion .\n\n\n \n\n \n\nAccording to Barth ,   a true understanding of real\nhumanity is to start not with human self-knowledge but with Jesus , the real\nhuman being   .\n\n\nBarth affirms the followings :\n\n\n( 1 ) Only Jesus is the real human being before God;\n(\n\n\n2 ) We , human being , are not real in the sense that we exist\nwithout in a \" real reality &rdquo; (\n\n\n3 ) Human being is in a continuity with God in Christ , even\nif he or she is not a Christian . \n\n \n\nThe real nature of humanity , for Barth , is primarily found not\nin Adam , but in Christ .\n\n\nIn his  Christ and Adam  , Barth finds that &rdquo; \nthe relationship between Adam and us reveals not the primary but only the\nsecondary anthropological truth and ordering principle  . &rdquo;\n\n\nThe primary truth and principle is to be found in Jesus Christ .\n\n\nBarth holds that the relationship between Adam and us must be\ninterpreted in the perspective of the relationship between Christ and us ,\neven though Christ is called \" the second Adam &rdquo; .\n\n\nThe reason is that it is &rdquo;  Christ who vouches for the\nauthenticity of Adam and not Adam who vouches for the authenticity of Christ .\n &rdquo;\n\n\nIn Barth  ' s understanding , the authentic human nature of Christ is\nnot to be seen from the perspective of Adam; instead , the latter is to be\nunderstood from the humanity of Christ , which reveals what a real human\nbeing is .\n\n\nOnly with this perspective , we can put the humanity of Adam in\nproper context .\n\n\nAs Barth puts it ,  \" The same human nature appears in\nboth ( Christ and Adam ) but the humanity of Adam is only real\nand genuine in so far as it reflects and corresponds to the humanity of\nChrist .  &rdquo;\n\n\nIn sum , our relationship to Christ provides an essential and\nsuperior priority over our relationship to Adam .\n\n\nAdam is only the \" provisional copy &rdquo; of the real\nhumanity that is in Christ .  \n\n\n3.2 \" Real Man &rdquo; : The Ontological Relation between God\nand Human Being \n\n \n\nFor Barth , the only alternative for a true understanding of real\nhumanity is to start with the real human being Jesus instead of human\nself-knowledge .\n\n\nThat means the history of Jesus provides the form and material\ncontent for us to understand the meaning of real human being .\n\n\nBarth asserts that since the man Jesus is for God ( for His\npresence , His divine deliverance , and therefore for His own glory , freedom\nand love ) , the human being as the being in the history (\n  Geschichte   ) of Jesus  '  humanity also\nshares the \" ontological determination &rdquo; (  \nontologische Bestimmung   ) shaped by the history of\nJesus Christ . \n\n \n\nAccording to McLean , Barth distinguishes between the formal and\nthe material dimension of a real human being .\n\n\nThe formal perspective of real human being , for Barth , is \"\nto be a man is to be with God .\n\n\n&rdquo; In this sense , no human being is without God . \n\n\n \" Whatever else he is , he is on the basis of the fact\nthat he is with Jesus and therefore with God . &rdquo;  \n\n\nEven though the human being exists in a godless way in an existential\nsense , ontologically speaking , it is impossible for a human being to be\nwithout God .\n\n\nIt is because &rdquo;  the fact that we are with God is not\nmerely one of many determinations of our being , derivative and mutable , but\nthe basic determination , original and immutable . &rdquo; \n\n\nFor this reason , Barth names the unreality of human existence as\n&rdquo;  ontological impossible  .\n\n\n&rdquo; According to the ontological determination of man , when one\nchooses evil and enters into conflict with God , he is making himself\nimpossible . &rdquo; \n\n\nReal human being is never genuinely godless .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "38f91ddf-2f2f-408d-9cef-ba6b3c06e78e", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.865161+00:00"}

\n\n \n\nRegarding your question about working in Canada as a part-time\nstudent , being a visa student , you must obtain the Employment Authorization\nbefore you can legally work in Canada .\n\n\nIt is very hard to get the Employment Authorization , however .\n\n\nBut it is possible to get a summer Employment Authorization for you\nto work in the summer -; because the summer vacation is usually 4 months\nin length so that you can still make some money .\n\n\nFurthermore , you are usually allowed to work on campus -; such\nas in the library , student cafeteria and so on even during the semesters .\n\n\nBesides , to be the worst , if you work in the Chinese restaurants\nas a waitress , you do not need any working permit at all -; as far as\nyou can speak Cantonese and maybe a little bit English -;\n\n\nHowever , I should remind you that to work in restaurants is hard .\n\n\n \n\nThe tuition fees for a visa student is about &dollar;6,000 a\nyear ( for Canadian citizen it is only &dollar;2,000 ) .\n\n\nPlus you have to pay for textbooks , school supplies for about\n&dollar;500 a year .\n\n\nFor a far from luxury living you need at least &dollar;500 each\nmonth .\n\n\nSo add together , you need around &dollar;13,000 a year to be able\nto get along .\n\n\nIncome from part-time job varies according to the nature of the work\n, but I think it is impossible to earn &dollar;13,000 by just having a\npart-time job .\n\n\nSo , you still need help from others in terms of financial\nassistance . \n\n \n\nHow is mom ?\n\n\nIs she busy doing everything ?\n\n\nI think you will help anyway . \n\n\nHow is your graduation dinner ?\n\n\nIt looks nice in the picture .\n\n \n\nI  ' ll have a test tomorrow .\n\n\nA case study and a computer assignment will be due in the following\nweeks .\n\n\nFinal exam is in mid-August , so I am getting pretty busy recently .\n\n\n \n\nI  ' ve got my driving licence for several months , but I still\ncannot afford a car -; the insurance premium , fuel , parking add up to a\nsky-high figure . \n\n \n\nEnclosed is one of my pictures -;\n\n\nit is not very well focused -;\n\n\nAnyway I don't take pictures oftenly . \n\n\nSay Hi to everybody for me .\n\n\nTell Arthur I will get the magazine for him .\n\n\nKeep in Touch .\n\n\nWith best regards .\n\n\nLove\n\n\nLouie \n\n\n\n\nAug. 7 , 90\n\n\nDear Lynn :\n\n\nHow are you doing ?\n\n \n\nBy the time you receive this letter , you probably have received\nyour marks for your exams already .\n\n\nAre they good ? \n\n \n\nI will have my final exam for the summer course next Wednesday\n( Aug 15th ) .\n\n\nAfter that I will have almost three weeks off , which will be very\nnice to me -;\n\n\nI plan to have a trip to Waterloo with my friend for a day .\n\n\nI also want to go to see the Metro Toronto Zoo , as well .\n\n\nHowever , for now I have to study really hard for the exam . \n\n \n\nHow is your Japanese course ?\n\n\nHow many hours do you go every week ?\n\n\nI hope you really enjoy it and do learn something out of it . \n\n \n\nI can understand the volunteer job is quite tedious for you .\n\n\nHowever , you really have to get used to it , for as far as I know ,\nif you come here in two years , the job you can get then will be even worse\n-;\n\n\nSome of the employers really make a hard time for you . \n\n \n\nI told grandpa about your plan to study overseas .\n\n\nThey really appreciated it .\n\n\nHowever , they want me to tell you that you should learn to take\ncare of yourself from now .\n\n\nFor example , you should learn how to cook for yourself , wash\ndishes after meals , do the laundry for mom and dad maybe etc .\n\n\nIn short , what I realize is they want you to have the   ability  of living on your own . \n\n \n\nIt is very nice and cool now in Toronto .\n\n\nI guess it is still pretty hot and humid now in Hong Kong .\n\n\nDo you meet Aunt Ellen and Arthur , Brian oftenly ?\n\n\nThey gonna come back soon .\n\n\nPlease tell them I have already ordered the clothes for Brian ,\nthanks ! \n\n \n\nI often think of the nicest days we spent together in Hangzhou\nas well -;\n\n\nHope some day we can have the same good time again .\n\n\nJingjing is working all right now , and she told me last time she\nwas going to night school studying English too . \n\n\nHow are Dad and mom ?\n\n\nIs Dad still in Shanghai ?\n\n\nWell , have to go to school .\n\n\nHope to hear from you soon .\n\n\nAll the best !\n\n\nLove\n\n\nLouie \n\n\n\n\nSept. 17 , 90\n\n\nDear Lynn :\n\n \n\nHow are you doing ?\n\n\nDid you start your classes yet ?\n\n\nHow many courses are you taking this semester ?

{"text": "Where to go diving in Hong Kong   \n\n\n Tung Ping Chau   \n\n\nBy Denis Yau   \n\n \n\nA skeleton shrimp on a gorgorian  \n\n \n\nHong Kong has a remote island of a very high scientific importance .\n\n\nIt is located at the eastern part of Hong Kong and is famous for its\nunique rock formations .\n\n\nIt has been a very popular field trip location for geography students\nfor many years .\n\n\nAs scuba diving gets popular , it is also becoming famous for its\ncoral abundance and variety .\n\n\nIf you are a reader of  Hong Kong Discovery  , you should\nknow it quite well ~ Tung Ping Chau (  or Ping Chau ) .  \n\n\n \n\nA tiny transport anemone shrimp on its host  \n\n\n \n\nThe colour of this sea anemone has changed to pink .\n\n\nThe reason is unknown .    \n\n \n\nAnother couple of sea anemones and anemone shrimp  \n\n \n\n W  ith the increasing public awareness of\nenvironmental conservation and the blooming of eco-tourism , Tung Ping Chau\nhas become quite popular in recent years and was designated as the fourth\nmarine park in Hong Kong in November 2001 .\n\n\nBecause of its remote location and limited human impact , the natural\nenvironment of Tung Ping Chau is well preserved .\n\n\nIn addition , as it is located far away from the Pearl River Delta ,\nit suffers minimal impact of the muddy freshwater of the river .\n\n\nAs a result , the water quality there is relatively good and allows a\nwide range of marine life to flourish .\n\n\nIn fact , Tung Ping Chau may have the richest hard coral diversity in\nHong Kong - more than 40 species .\n\n\nMoreover , it is home to over 40 species of algae and over 100\nspecies of marine invertebrates .\n\n\nFor fish lovers , the fish diversity here will not disappoint you .\n\n\n \n\nHard corals in Tung Ping Chau are most densely populated in areas\nnext to Tai Tong Wan and between A Ma Wan and Kan Lau Shek .\n\n\nThey form large communities in area shallower than 15 feet with the\nmajority aggregated in shallow shore areas .\n\n\nLike the hard coral in Hoi Ha Wan , some of them are exposed to the\nair during low tides .\n\n\nThe water visibility there is unusually good . It is not uncommon to\nhave visibility over 20 feet .\n\n\nThe hard coral communities can therefore be easily seen directly from\nboat .\n\n\nIn these areas , you can find a lot of coral-associated marine\norganisms .\n\n\nButterfly fishes and sweepers are abundant .\n\n\nAlso , it is common to see cornets , moray eels , squids , sweetlips\n, sea horses , yellowtail barracudas and various species of snappers ,\nwrasses , groupers , and gobies , etc .\n\n\nSome of the species sometimes occur in small groups .\n\n\nI have seen more than 10 sweetlips wandering around together in one\ndive and more than 20 yellowtail barracudas in another dive .\n\n\nApart from these common animals , the rarely seen pipefish can also\nbe found here .\n\n\nFor invertebrates , there are nudibranchs , interesting spider crabs\n, shrimps , etc .\n\n\nIn the area near Kan Lau Shek , there are large communities of sea\nanemones and associated shrimps and anemone fishes .   \n\n \n\nA sendperch always keep alert to environmental changes   \n\n \n\nA sea urchin living in an abandoned fish trap .\n\n\nThe whitish part is its mouth .   \n\n \n\nA baby anemone fish in hiding among the tentacles of its host\n \n\n \n\n(  The sea anemone in the above three photos should belong to the\nsame species , but their colour is quite different. ) \n\n \n\nWhen going to areas deeper than 15 feet , you will find that the\nwhole area is a gentle sandy slope .\n\n\nAlthough it looks like a desert , it is the place where you can find\nthe timid sole fish , starfish , etc .\n\n\nIf you are lucky enough , you may see the amazing butterfly ray too .\n\n\nOccasionally , large schools of tiny silvery fishes move around\nquickly , probably fleeing away from predators .\n\n\nIf you go deeper , you may find some colourful soft corals and\ngorgonians .\n\n\nHowever , the visibility there is poorer .   \n\n \n\nA pipefish which is rarely seen in Hong Kong \n\n \n\nIn the area between Kan Lau Shek and Lung Lok Shui , the seabed\nbecomes rock .\n\n\nThe underwater environment is quite different from that described\nabove .\n\n\nThere are fewer hard corals but more fishes .\n\n\nSome of them are the bigger predatory species .\n\n\nIn winter and spring , this is the place to see large communities of\nmarine algae .\n\n\nThe dominating ones are the   Sargassum  \nspecies .\n\n\nTheir abundance is more than those in Tai Chau .\n\n\nIt is fun to wander around this underwater jungle .\n\n\nBesides the large sargassum algae , you can find some smaller brown\nand green algae as well .\n\n\nJust like jungles on land , a lot of small animals make their homes\nhere: snails , cardinal fishes , shrimps , etc .\n\n\nSome divers with keen eyes even find a rare skeleton shrimp .\n\n\nAs they are very small and quite transparent , it is very difficult\nto spot them .\n\n\nHave a try if you dive there next time .   \n\n \n\nA scorpion fish is waiting motionlessly for its prey \n\n \n\nAs Tung Ping Chau is getting popular , more people are visiting\nthis wonderful island on weekends and public holidays .\n\n\nMore people mean more business opportunities .\n\n\nEco-tours are organized every week , not only on land but also in the\nsea .\n\n\nDuring summer time , there are many snorkellers floating on the sea\nsurface (  yes , float please , don't step on the corals! ) and enjoying the\nclear water and rich coral communities of Tung Ping Cahu .\n\n\nSome people even organize snorkelling courses and one-day scuba\ndiving experience courses there .\n\n\nFor the sake of safety , it is important to check whether these \"\ninstructors &rdquo; have really acquired the internationally recognized\ndiving instructor rating .

Pay special attention to the Oak trees beside the path .\n\n\nProbably you can find the beautiful and rare .\n\n\nBurmese Bush Blue (   Arhopala birmana   ) somewhere around\nthe trees , as these butterflies are especially active during autumns .\n\n\nTheir wings glitter with metallic violet blue , while the underside\nof the wings is adorned with some marble-like patterns .\n\n\nAll these make the Burmese Blue Bush a fascinating creature to watch .\n\n\nHowever , they are rather sensitive to any disturbance .\n\n\nThat  ' s why you have to be more patient when searching for and\nobserving this species . \n\n \n\nWhen you look down from the upper part of the hill , you can\neasily find several white butterflies flying around the slope .\n\n\nThere are three types of larger butterflies , including Great Orange\nTip (   Herbomoia glaucippe   ) , Spotted Sawtooth (   Prioneris\nthestylis   ) and Painted Jezebel (   Delias hyparete   ) .\n\n\nThey look especially graceful with the slope of greenery , as the\nbackground .\n\n\nIt is rather difficult to snap a shot of them , unless they stop for\na while for some nectar .  \n\n \n\nDanaid Egg-fly (   Hypolimnis misippus   )  \n\n \n\nSpotted Sawtooth (   Prioneris thestylis   )  \n\n \n\nGlassy Bluebottle (   Graphium cloanthus   ) \n\n \n\nAfter reaching the hilltop , you will probably spend a long\nperiod of time there .\n\n\nSince the butterflies reside at the hilltop , they will not fly away\nbut dance around you .\n\n\nHere surely you can find some mountain residents , like Indian\nFritillary (   Argyreus hyperbius   ) Danaid Egg-fly (   Hypolimnis\nmissippus   ) and Common Mine (   Chilasa clytia   ) .\n\n\nIf you are lucky enough , you might find a species that occurs at\n Ngau Ngak shan  , Orange Staff Sergeant (   Athyma cama\n  ) , which is a very rare species .\n\n\nThey usually occur at the lower part of the peak , at the canopy of\nthe trees .\n\n\nAt this time , a telephoto lens would be most helpful for you to\nphotograph them .\n\n\nBesides , the rare species that normally do not stop for long ,\nGlassy Bluebottle (   Graphium cloanthus   ) , can easily be found\nmotionless and posturing in front of your lens at  Ngau Ngak Shan\n .\n\n\nIt is always an enjoyable experience to watch the Glassy Bluebottle\ndancing in the air with their translucent wings . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Introduction of Footprint   \n\n\n Footprint  \n\n \n\n'Footprint &rdquo; is an organization of a group of enthusiastic\nuniversity students towards nature and environmental protection , majority of\nwhom are students or graduates from the Chinese University of Hong Kong .\n\n\nWe mainly serve primary and secondary schools , and hope to evoke\ninterest in concerning ecological footprint , global environmental protection\nand poverty among the students through activities like seminars , and\ninterest classes .  \n\n\n Sentimental Eco-tourism   \n\n \n\n S  entimental eco-tourism is the way of tourism\nthat Footprint encourages .\n\n\nOnly with passion for nature could we appreciate what it offers .\n\n\nIf we do not even spare a minute to observe the little creatures\naround us and listen to the song from nature , how could our affection for\nnature be evolved ?\n\n\nEven from a single piece of shed leaf , you can see the veins\nrunning in complicated crisscross pattern .\n\n\nHow can you be hardhearted towards such a miraculous life ?

{"text": "Work and Family  \n\n\n There are a close and indispensable linkage between work and family in\nour lives .\n\n\nIn this paper , we attempt to discuss the work role together with\nfamily .\n\n\nAs we are deeply interested in looking into the gender inequality in\nwork and family , so heavy emphasis will be placed on the role played by male\nand female in workplace as well as family .\n\n\nGenerally speaking , people today stress in the equality between both\nsexes in the sense that they opposed to the male domination in work and\ndouble role played by women .\n\n\nThey tried hard to abolish the traditional view and re-establish a set\nof new value .\n\n\nHowever , even though the society is changing and becomes more and\nmore fair and equal , sexual inequality does exist in work and family .\n\n\nSo besides male occupational supremacy and female double role , we are\nalso concern to trend of the changing society towards this two sexes in both\nareas .\n\n\nBefore the discussion of work role , we should know what work is .\n\n\n\n Work is one of the crucial social roles preformed by people in any\nsociety .\n\n\nAlthough the structure and nature of work vary immensely within and\nbetween societies over time , production through work remains principal .\n\n\nIn a discussion of the meaning of work for individual , Fox suggested\nthat there are two great alternative meaning .\n\n\nWork may be an activity of main importance to his personality and\nlife fulfillment , or it may be little more than a tiresome necessity in\nacquiring the resource for survival .\n\n\nIn addition , work has been taken on a broader meaning to individual\nand society .\n\n\nThat means , the performance of a work role is also a source of\nsocial integration .\n\n\nStudied of retirement and unemployment showed that loss of the work\nrole creates difficulties for some people .\n\n\nThey may no longer feel part of society in general and may also lose\nsocial contacts , and a sense of accomplishments .\n\n\nAs a matter of fact that people in different social classes have\nsimilar values regarding the importance of being able to work and the desire\nto have a worthwhile and productive job .\n\n\nOn the contrary , welfare as a desirable alternative to work is\nconsistently rejected .\n\n\nThe materials and symbolic value of success and achievement have\nintensified the significance of work role .\n\n\nIn other words , success and achievement in the occupational sphere\nare considered as a form of personal worth . \n\n\n From above , we know that work is regarded as a method of life\nfulfillment , a way for survival or a source of social integration .\n\n\nHowever , in tradition , work is the primary job of men only .\n\n\nHe is the sole provider in the family .\n\n\nAccording to Webster  ' s definition , a good provider is one who\nprovides food , clothing , etc. for his family .\n\n\nMore simply , he could be defined as a man whose wife did not have to\nenter the labour force .\n\n\nSo , we can see that work seems to be a matter of men while the main\nrole of women is to make invisible contribution-housework , child care and\nthe support of their husband  ' s careers .\n\n\nThis sexual division of labour in work sphere and family , in fact ,\nlead to a great deal of problems which are worthwhile to be discussed .\n\n\nIn the first place , we want to raise a question : if work is mainly\ndefined as a source of life fulfillment , is it unfair to women that they\ncannot have these fulfillment derived from work ?\n\n\nOn the other hand , provided that work is no more than a way of\nsurvival , in return , whether it is an inequality that men should be the\nbreadwinner of the family solely \n\n\n It goes without saying , owing to the sexual segregation of work-men\nbeing the breadwinner while women as a housekeeper , many people think that\nit is unfair to men because they are expected to work during the adult years\nfrom the ends of schooling until retirement .\n\n\nThey are expected to be major providers for their family by providing\ntheir wives and children with an adequate standard of living .\n\n\nMen with unstable , low-paying jobs find it almost impossible to\nmaintain satisfactory family lives .\n\n\nWhen men do not provide sufficient resources for their family , the\nfamily relationship suffer .\n\n\nThe problems derived from the lack of financial resource and the\nfailure of the men to meet strong normative expectation .\n\n\nSo , although there is a long history of men having great authority\nand higher status , they own them are not without cost .\n\n\nEvery man in society does face with a huge pressure inevitably . \n\n\n However , have we thought that it is an inequality to women ?\n\n\nThe role of housekeeper deprived them of many rights and privilege by\nplacing them in a peculiarly vulnerable position .\n\n\nBecause she was not paid for her contribution to family in either\nproducts or services , a wife was limited to a considerable extent of her\naccess to money markets .\n\n\nBy discouraging labour force participation , it deprived many women ,\nespecially affluent ones , of opportunities to achieve interest , strength\nand competence .\n\n\nIt deterred young women from acquiring productive skills .\n\n\nIt   deterred  young women from acquiring\nproductive skills resulting in women ! ! dependent on men .\n\n\nOnce their husband leave them , they would suffer  \nfrom  serious financial problem by reasons of the lack of productive\nskills .\n\n\nWorse still , the long period of loss of contact with society and\npeople , they become ignorant and are hard to adapt a new environment and\nacquire a technical skill in an ever-changing society .\n\n\nBut the most significant matter is that , for those women who have to\nstay at home as caregivers and housekeepers , this sexual division of labors\nlimit and restrict the choice of women .\n\n\nBy the same token , unlike men who can often choose between work and\nleisure .\n\n\nThey are bond to no choice .\n\n\nBut to serve her husband and family .\n\n\nEven though women can handle both work and family , the choice are\njust between work and family , instead of choosing leisure . \n\n\n Now , we are going to discuss the problem of why society always imprison\nthat work is the primary role of men .\n\n\nActually , the good provider as a specialized male role seems to have\narisen in the transition from subsistence to market economies .\n\n\nUndeniably , men are physically stronger than women .\n\n\nIt is believed that they are more capable to take up difficult jobs\nsuch as hunting and mining which are more energy consuming .\n\n\nIn addition to this , the traditional thought of large family result\nin the male dominance in work as well .\n\n\nFrom the very beginning , the idea of large family was very\nprevailing .\n\n\nWomen were always busy with reproduction by virtue of the great\ndemand for labour force in their own farms .\n\n\nThereby , they should stay at home and are responsible to reproduce\nand take care their children .\n\n\nConsequently , the role of provider fall over men .\n\n\nBy now , more and more women participate in work , but the truth is\nthat , many people still think men are more rational and thinking , they seem\nto be more able to do the higher position job .\n\n\nIn our society , men sometimes if not most monopolized the upper rank\noccupation , such as president , doctor , accountant and manager , leaving\nthe lower rank job to women such as clerk , secretary and assistant . \n\n\n In fact , male occupational supremacy is more than a norm in most\nsocieties in the sense that it is a typical pattern of family and work\norganization also an ideology , a system of believe which is extremely\ninfluential in forming images of hoe work and family life ought to be\norganized .\n\n\nAlso , it is norm for wives to shape their labour participation to\nthe demands of husbands  '  employment and family commitments .\n\n\nOn closer examination , this norm of male dominance in work is\nactually rooted from socialization .\n\n\nManhood is earned or proven through an ideology that glorifies powers\n, toughness , assertiveness , bravery and independence .\n\n\nBrannon ( 1985 ) identified four dimensions of\nmasculinity consistent with this ideology : not being feminine &semi; being\nrespected and admired for successful achievement &semi; never showing\nuncertainty or weakness &semi; and seeking adventure and risks , including\nthe acceptance of violence if necessary .\n\n\nThis ideology requires men to see themselves as highly independent\nand self-sufficient .\n\n\nHowever , as a matter of fact that dependence is experienced by all\nhuman being , not only women and is a healthy , adaptive and positive aspect\nof human development .\n\n\nBut female emotional dependence on men was purposely exaggerated to\nimprison men  ' s normal dependency on women .\n\n\nWhereas , still today , many women are socialized to believe that\nbeing partnered or married is a first priority in life and achieving\nfinancial independence and career recognition come to secondary to their\nroles .\n\n\nConsistent with this gender stereotype , a report indicated that\nclassroom teachers give significantly more attention and esteem-building\nencouragement to boys than girls , that images of women as contributors to\nknowledge still are or ignored in textbooks and classroom activities . \n\n\n What is more , men  ' s desire to exclude women in order to keep their own\nwages up leads to male-occupational supremacy , too .\n\n\nAs all we know , contrary to the stereotype , cognitive abilities of\nboth women and men are higher similar ( Fausto-Sterling , 1985\n) .\n\n\nThere is also evidence that women perform better than men in college\nas reflected in higher grades in their major field and taking less time to\ncomplete their degree ( U.S. Department of Education , 1991 ) .\n\n\nSo , women , in fact , are capable to compete with make in work .\n\n\nHowever , men always consciously monopolized in workplace and\nrestricted the entry of women into their working world leading to higher\ndegree of occupational segregation in sex , with female concentrate in lower\npaying and lower status occupation while men occupied the higher ranking and\nhigher standing jobs .\n\n\nSurprisingly , due to the socialization again , women seldom show\ntheir refused and disagreement .\n\n\nWomen not only play down their intellectual ability and their\nprofessional ambition but to emphasize their physical beauty and\nattractiveness as well in order to attract men , which in turn require that\nthey somehow subordinate themselves to men .\n\n\nThese behaviour serves to protect men from the fact that these women\nmay be smarter or more capable than men and to protect women form the\nrejection brought by men .\n\n\nIt is not surprising that wives of professional and managers ,\ninstead of working out , often assists their husband career by performing all\nhousehold task to allow husband more time for work .\n\n\nThis explains why male have some advantages to develop their career .\n\n\n\n There are a great deal of evidence showing the male occupational\nsupremacy .\n\n\nWe can easily to hear that there is unequal paid between men and\nwomen even though they have same qualification and experience .\n\n\nMoreover , unequal promotion opportunities is not uncommon as well .\n\n\nChances for men to promote a higher position and higher status job is\nfar greater than that of the women .\n\n\nWhy should women often be forced to do low status or serving job ?\n\n\n\n However , the most worst is that sexual harassment which refers to the\nunwanted imposition of sexual requirement in the context of unequal power ,\nhappen everywhere Many men hold an unconscious view that they are superior to\nwomen and that women should accommodate to men  ' s need .\n\n\nThe unwanted touching , behavior and attitudes scar women and create\na disadvantageous environment to develop their career .\n\n\nOn number of occasion , they show that women are willing to give way\nfor men to be major breadwinner or provider .\n\n\nFor instance , women always do not negotiate with their husband about\nthe financial dominance and privilege because they fear losing the\nrelationship or feel less competent and assured than the male partner .\n\n\nTherefore , wives always subordinate their career desires to their\npartner  ' s plan and aspirations .\n\n\nA finding reveals that number of women narrowed their professional\nand personal options once they had a boyfriend . \n\n\n This finding fit with those of other  \nresearchers  .\n\n\nThey said that a talented women who decided to forge her last year of\ncollege to join her boyfriend who was graduating and moving to another city :\n\n\n I can finish my degree at any time so why I risk the\nrelationship  ?\n\n\nAnother show how easy it was for a young women decide to marry after\ncompleting advanced degree . \n\n\n According to the above evidence , we find that women usually are under\nmen  ' s control in working sphere .\n\n\nThen how about the role taking of women in family ?\n\n\nWould it be the same as that at work ?\n\n\nIn reality , we find that inequality do occur in division of\ndomestic labour between husband and wife , women do housework as and\nsometimes husband help to do \" their &rdquo; work .\n\n\nIf there is a division of labour , men act as breadwinner whereas\nwomen become the housekeeper , then what force women take up outside job too ?", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ae8f9ceb-1e52-4f08-ac1b-a5ed655431f8", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.868846+00:00"}

. \n\n \n\nThe independent legislator Emily Lau said Lau  ' s disqualification\nwas a \" dress rehearsal &rdquo; to show Hong Kong people that those who\ndo not toe the political line would be barred from running for election in\nthe future . \n\n \n\nThe Government yesterday denied its decision was politically\nmotivated . \n\n \n\nIt said Lau failed to satisfy the condition of being \"\nordinarily resident &rdquo; in the territory for 10 years prior to the\nelection , referring to Lau  ' s imprisonment in China . \n\n \n\nThis is despite the fact that Lau  ' s wife , Christina Tang , was\nallowed to stand in the district board elections in 1985 although she had\nspent 12 years abroad . \n\n \n\nIn applying the residency rule , which had not been used to\ndisqualify any candidate in any previous elections , the Government also\ndisqualified a member of Meeting Point , Danny Chin . \n\n \n\nChin spent six years in the United States during the 10 years\nbefore the election . \n\n \n\n\" The Hong Kong government is betraying the democracy of\nHong Kong, &rdquo;

and stand in the Sai Kung\nconstituency . \n\n \n\nWong came in for criticism yesterday for voting in June against\nLau  ' s private member  ' s bill to have all 60 seats in Legco directly elected .\n\n\n \n\nThe United Ants , an advocacy group for human rights and full\ndemocracy went to Wong  ' s ward office to accuse him of killing Lau  ' s bill\nwhich was defeated by one vote . \n\n \n\nWong said he voted against the bill , as there was little hope\nChina would amend electoral arrangements laid down in the Basic Law to\ndovetail with the full democracy bill . \n\n \n\nHe said he rejected it because it would be seen by China as a\nprovocative move . \n\n \n\nAt a rowdy confrontation , the united Ants accused Wong of being\n\" anti-democratic and anti-human rights &rdquo; . \n\n \n\nThey said he was going against the wishes of his constituents .\n\n\n \n\nThey lambasted him for opposing amendments to give New\nTerritories women equal inheritance rights , saying that showed his lack of\nrespect for human rights . \n\n \n\nBut Wong criticised the United Ants for \" playing games\n&rdquo; with their campaign for full democracy . \n\n \n\n\" I follow my own judgment .\n\n\nI do what  ' s right for Hong Kong , &rdquo; Wong said .  \n\n \n\n\n Loh to set out own policy vision   \n\n\n Wing Kay Po  \n\n \n\nAn independent legislator will take the unprecedented step of\npreparing an alternative policy address to the one to be delivered by the\nGovernor , Chris Patten , in October . \n\n \n\nChristine Loh said yesterday she hoped an \" alternative\nvision &rdquo; of policy in various areas would widen public discussion on\nhow the community could move forward . \n\n \n\nCovered in Loh  ' s document would be an alternative vision of\neconomic development in Hong Kong , a discussion on executive-led government\n, and how open government could be developed . \n\n \n\nOther topics would be public health , transport and human rights\nissues .\n\n\nLoh has not decided whether to include a section on constitutional\ndevelopment and Sino-Hong Kong and Sino-British relations . \n\n \n\nShe would put forward her alternative policy vision before Patten  ' s\naddress to Legco on October 5 . \n\n \n\nShe would put forward her alternative policy vision before\nalternative policy vision before Patten  ' s address to Legco on October 5 .\n \n\n \n\n\n Setback for dissident  ' s election hopes   \n\n\n Wing Kay Po  \n\n \n\nLau San-ching , the dissident jailed in China for 10 years for\n\" counter-revolutionary activities &rdquo; will be told today if he is\neligible to contest Hong Kong  ' s district board elections in September . \n\n \n\nLau intends this morning to confront the Kwai Tsing returning\nofficer -; the official responsible for making the decision -; armed\nwith legal advice that he is eligible to stand as a candidate in the\nelections . \n\n \n\nHe has vowed to sue the Government if it rejects his nomination\nfor candidacy . \n\n \n\nOther candidates will also be notified by their respective\ndistrict officers . \n\n \n\nLau said his own barrister , who is preparing legal advice for\nhim , had told him he was eligible to stand despite his absence from Hong\nKong during his jail sentence on the mainland . \n\n \n\nLegislation states that only those who are \" ordinarily\nresident &rdquo; in the territory for the 10 years before an election are\neligible to stand in the election . \n\n \n\nIt also states that those who have a criminal conviction\nresulting in a jail sentence of more than three months during the 10 years\nleading up to the election will be disqualified . \n\n \n\nYesterday , the chief electoral officer , Carrie Willis , told\nLau and his supporters at an open meeting that restrictions relating to\ncriminal conviction were irrelevant in Lau  ' s case as he had been convicted\nin 1981 , more than 10 years before this year  ' s election . \n\n \n\nThe only determining factor would be the residency requirement ,\nshe said . \n\n \n\nWillis said the returning officer in Kwai Tsing had made a\ndecision on Lau  ' s eligibility as a candidate after seeking legal advice on\nhis application . \n\n \n\nThe Government sought legal advice at the end of last year when\nhe first checked on his eligibility to stand for public office . \n\n \n\nLau argues he was \" ordinarily resident &rdquo; in Hong\nKong during his detention in China because he was detained against his will\nand prevented form returning to the territory . \n\n \n\nThe Legal Department advised the Government that \" short\nperiods of absence from Hong Kong &rdquo; may not affect the residency\nrequirement \" depending on the circumstances &rdquo; . \n\n \n\nThe Registration and Electoral Office then informed Lau that\n\" the period of your absence is of such length that it cannot be\nbridged by this argument &rdquo; . \n\n \n\n\" During your years of detention you were not resident in\nHong Kong, &rdquo; the office said .\n\n\n\" ( The Office is ) advised a court would find\nthat you were not ordinarily resident in Hong Kong during that period.\n&rdquo; \n\n \n\nWillis would not say if further legal advice sought by the\ndistrict  ' s returning officer reached the same conclusion . \n\n \n\nShe said the returning officer was the only person who could\nmake the decision . \n\n \n\nLau said he would sue the Government for breaching the Bill of\nRights if his application was rejected .\n\n\nHe said that the human rights ordinance stated that no one should be\ndeprived of their rights for political reasons and that he should not be\ndisqualified from candidacy because he was detained on political grounds in\nChina . \n\n \n\nUnder electoral legislation , Lau can appeal against the\nreturning officer  ' s decision in the High Court within two months of the\nelection . \n\n \n\nIf the High Court upholds the appeal , a by-election would be\nheld .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "039309b6-ea6f-4a1b-b6fd-21ff07386e2c", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.870020+00:00"}

\n\nDrain pipes , anti-syphonage pipes and ventilation pipes inside a\nbuilding can be fixed inside a pipe duct which is provided with access panels\nto reach to all pipe connections .\n\n\nFalls of drains are also noted as these may cross with structures or\naffecting headroom .  \n\n \n\nManholes are provided at change of direction of drains (  except\nsmall changes ) and not exceeding 60m length .\n\n\nCovers for manholes are standard cast iron double-sealed covers .\n\n\nA second cover incorporating the adjacent floor finish can be added\nfor aesthetics reason . \n\n \n\nCleaning eyes are provided at bends for soil pipes and waste\npipes to facilitate cleaning .\n\n\nThus access panels are designed for accessibility to these cleaning\neyes e.g . at side or end wall of a bath-tub , false ceiling to reach\ncleaning eyes of upper floor . \n\n \n\nCesspools , septic tanks and sewerage treatment plants are\nconstructed in accordance with the Regulations .\n\n\nTesting is carried out to satisfy they Environmental Protection unit .\n\n\nGrease traps are provided for commercial kitchens and carparks to\nrelieve contamination to nature .  \n\n \n\nIt is noted that connection of the drain to public sewer and\nconstruction of the last manhole are carried out by the Drainage Division of\nHighways Departments , such cost involved will be recovered from the owner of\nthe development . \n\n \n\nAn aperture for gas water heater is required to be provided at\nbathrooms and shower rooms .\n\n\nThe size of the standard aperture is 380 &times; 380mm or 240 &times; 240mm when\nonly a shower is installed .\n\n\nLocation of the aperture is governed by regulation with unobstructed\narea around .\n\n\nIf no heater is fitted during construction , the standard aperture\ncan be sealed by easily-removable brickwork or blockwork .\n\n\nHowever , the position of which is made distinguishable .    \n\n\nPLUMING PIPEWORK  \n\n \n\nFor city water supply system , materials for pipework include\ngalvanized steel , copper , unplasticised PVC .\n\n\nCopper pipes or plastic coated copper pipes are used for hot water\nsystem and inside the bathrooms .\n\n\nCopper pipes are provided with expansion joints over 12m length .\n\n\nHowever , care must be taken at installation to avoid any damages\nwhich may lead to subsequent troublesome water leakage when all the finishes\nare installed .\n\n\nDuctile iron pipes are used to stand heavy loads when the system of\npipework passes through carriageway .    \n\n \n\nFor flush water supply system , ductile iron pipes are used as\ndelivery pipe for salt water; galvanized steel pipes are used as delivery\npipe for city water , nullah intake or well .\n\n\nOther pipes of the distribution system are of PVC pipes which are\nkept a minimum distance of 150mm from hot water pipes . \n\n \n\nPipes are run in walls , floor screeds or pipe ducts .\n\n\nPipes through walls and floors are first cast in PVC sleeves with 2\nto 12mm clearance for expansion and movement .\n\n\nMastic sealant can be used to achieve watertightness .\n\n\nIf through fire rated walls and floors , galvanized mild steel pipe\nsleeve with 20mm clearance is used .\n\n\nThe clearance space is then caulked with mineral wool .\n\n\nPipes through flat roofs are by case iron or galvanized mild steel\nsleeve with 2 to 12 mm clearance projecting 150mm above roof

.\n\n\n \n\nLaying of pipes outside the building is first by setting out with\nlevels .\n\n\nExcavation is done in trenches .\n\n\nOn completion of excavation , the pipes are laid .\n\n\nBeds and surrounds are provided to support the pipes: - (  1 ) \nNatural bedding . \n\n\nFor places like planters and lawn where light traffic is envisaged\nand for short length of pipes , natural bedding by trimming earth to provide\nuniform and solid bearing is acceptable . \n\n \n\n(  2 )  Granular bedding . \n\n\nBedding with coarse aggregate provides some support to the pipe which\nis applicable on virgin land and light traffic .    \n\n \n\n(  3 )  Concrete bedding . \n\n\nPipes are laid in continuous concrete bed or precast cradles and then\nhaunch and surround after testing .\n\n\nIn areas like newly filled land where settlement is possible , short\nsteel piles called monkey piles are provided for the foundation support to\ngive the strongest bedding for pipes . \n\n \n\nAfter bedding is complete (  for concrete bedding , wait for 48\nhours ) , the trenches are backfilled and compacted . \n\n \n\nSub-soil drain pipes can be concrete porous drain pipes ,\nunglazed clay were field drain pipes , perforated vitrified clay were pipes\nor perforated plastic pipes .\n\n\nNatural bedding or granular bedding is provided . \n\n \n\nOverflow pipes for roofs are constructed with 75mm PVC pipes\nprojecting 75mm over the side of the external wall .\n\n\nThe design of such is to avoid water coming down into the building in\ncase the surface channels are blocked up .     \n\n\nFIRE SERVICE INSTALLATION RELATED WORK  \n\n \n\nFire Service Inlet and Sprinkler Inlet poured in steel boxes with\nlabel panels are located near the entrance of a building at prominent\nlocation for ease of access in case of fire .\n\n\nTo give a better outlook , a concealed type of design is often used\nfor the panel doors . \n\n \n\nHose reels often concealed in recessed housing in typical floor .\n\n\nThe control and nozzle are at a position not more than 1350mm from\nthe finished floor .\n\n\nConsideration has to be made to ensure that when the closet door are\nopen , the width of escape route is not decreased .\n\n\nAlongside with hose reels are fire alarms and break glass call points\nwhich can be installed as recessed fittings also .\n\n\nThe call points are not more than 1200mm

.\n\n\nAn external wall is required for access and ventilation .\n\n\nA switch room of adequate size is located adjacent to the transformer\nroom .\n\n\nIt is noted that Hong Kong Electrical Company and China Light &ampersand; Power\nCompany have their own requirement for the transformer room such as\nconstruction of the doors . \n\n \n\nMeter rooms and electrical/telephone ducts located in typical\nfloors are fitted with fire rated doors , screwed on or self-closing .\n\n\nExposed trucking in ceiling of smoke lobby can be protected by fire\nrated ceiling like durasteel .      \n\n\nLIFT-RELATED WORK  \n\n \n\nThe design of lifts is subject to the Building (  Lifts)\nRegulations and approval by Electrical and Mechanical Service Department .\n\n\nLift shafts and lift pits are constructed with at least 2 hours fire\nrating period i.e . 125mm minimum think reinforced concrete .\n\n\nIn case where there is accessible floor space below the lift pit ,\nadditional structural requirement for the lift pit floor may be imposed by\nthe Building Authority . \n\n \n\nMachine rooms have clear heights not less than 2.1 m .\n\n\nThe doors of such rooms are self-closing and outward open with a\nfire rating period not less than half an hour . \n\n \n\nFor lifts that do not have landing doors in some floors ,\nemergency access to the lift shaft are provided at intervals not greater than\n11m for the sake of evacuating passengers in the lifts for emergency .\n\n\nSuch access have a minimum height of 1.8m and a minimum width of\n0.5m , open outwards from the lift/shaft and with a fire rating period not\nless than one hour .\n\n\nA sign marking the rescue door is displayed . \n\n \n\nEvery landing door is constructed with not less than one hour\nfire rating period .\n\n\nAdjacent to the landing door is displayed signs of \" when\nthere is a fire , do not use the lift &rdquo; which is incorporated as part\nof the lift lobby design .     \n\n\nAIR-CONDITIONING RELATED WORK  \n\n \n\nCentral air-conditioning plants are exempted from gross floor\narea calculation but they still occupy a lot of space and generate noise and\nvibration , thus requiring acoustical consideration .\n\n\nChilled water pipes , air ducts and air handling units occupy space\nwithin typical floors .\n\n\nLouvres are required on exterior of building for intake and exhaust\nair . \n\n \n\nFor window-type air-conditioning units in residential buildings\n, wall boxes or platforms are constructed as amenity features to improve the\nstructural security of these installations .\n\n\nBesides structural stability , noise , vibration , exhaust air or\ndripping water are also considered .     \n\n\nREFUSE COLLECTION WORK  \n\n \n\nRefuse collection is governed by the Building (  Refuse Storage\nChambers and Chutes ) Regulations . \n\n \n\nThe refuse storage chamber is provided for domestic building\nwith more than 1320 s.m . usable floor area and for non-domestic building\nwith more than 3960 s.m . carparks , industrial buildings , schools and\nchurches are exempted .\n\n\nFor very large buildings the storage chamber is designed as to\npermit vehicular access to it for removal of refusal containers . \n\n \n\nThe storage chamber is located so as to have at least one\nexternal wall .\n\n\nExcept for the access door and the hopper , there is no openings\ninside the chamber which has no dimension less than 1.5m and ceiling height\nnot less than 2m .\n\n\nConstruction is usually of brickwork , blockwork or concrete .\n\n\nInternal finishes for walls are glazed tiles , for ceiling it is\nsmooth cement rendering and for floor it is quarry tiles laid to fall towards\nan outlet drain as well as with coved tile at the floor and wall junction .\n\n\nA water supply point is installed inside . \n\n \n\nThe access door to the storage chamber is a close-fitting steel\ndoor without any internal projections .\n\n\nSize is not less than 1.8m high

Porter identified three generic strategies for achieving\ncompetitive advantage in the market place: cost , differentiation and focus\nleadership (  2 ) .\n\n\nOrganizations continuously search for new and innovative ways to\nimplement these strategies successfully .\n\n\nThe logistics function has been identified in many organizations as\nproviding an excellent opportunity to exploit the above strategies . \n\n \n\nPorter also included the concept of a value chain that \"\ndisaggregates &rdquo; a firm into its strategically relevant activities in\norder to understand the behaviour of costs and the existing and potential\nsources of differentiation .\n\n\nHe suggested that a firm gains competitive advantage by performing\nthese important activities either less expensively or better than its\ncompetitors . \n\n \n\nThe value chain analysis is a systematic way of analysing both\nthe direct and support activities carried out by an organization .\n\n\nIt is used to analyse how to improve cost structure (  productivity ) and value added (  product differentiation ) .\n\n\nIn the MISR project , the value chain follows the route of entry of a\nnew project through the various processes on to the finish of the project and\nbeyond . \n\n \n\nValue chain analysis has two levels .\n\n\nInitially , each activity is analysed for opportunity for the company\nnetworking services to reduce cost or add value .\n\n\nThen , the interaction between activities is analysed for\nopportunities to reduce costs further and add value through enhanced\ncoordination , integration , and information flows . \n\n \n\nBottleneck analysis devises strategic action to eliminate\nbottlenecks throughout the value chain .\n\n\nThe major information infrastructure bottlenecks are: Application\ndevelopment\n\n\nConfiguration management\n\n\nNetwork computing operation , administration and maintenance\n\n\nPlatforms - Technology Envelope Model\n\n\nApplication - strategic application \n\n \n\nBreaking these bottlenecks provides the basic for advantage .\n\n\nM.E . Porter also identified \" service &rdquo; as one of the\nprimary activities in the value chain and suggests that the principal value\nof the service is that it may help to enhance or maintain the value of the\nproduct , through activities such as installation , repair training , parts\nsupply and product adjustment . \n\n \n\nAnother way to understand the overall cost structure is via value\nsystem analysis , which can be considered as an external value chain .\n\n\nThis is a systematic approach to examining the interaction between\norganizations within a value system and identifying opportunities for\nnetworking systems to reduce costs or add value through enhanced coordination\n, integration and information flow .\n\n\nIt establishes a framework for analyzing interaction between supply\nchains - can the networking system reduce cost or add value through enhanced\ncoordination , integrate and information flow between organizations , for\nexample by including the customer and vendor in the value chain in order to\nreduce costs or add value ? \n\n \n\nCritical success factor analysis is the technique used to focus\nattention on a limited number of areas to ensure successful performance .\n\n\nThe tasks identified to be done is the critical business issue .\n\n\nThe objective is to assist users to adopt IT infrastructure to\nenhance competitive advantage . \n\n \n\nIn the MISR project , the critical business issue identified was:\nto optimize the network system availability to support the key applications\nthat are vital to the success of the project .\n\n\nThis issue should also identify the way that performance is measured\n, the impact of reaching the target level , the current objective and the\nfuture goal .   \n\n\nThe Strategic Management Process  \n\n \n\n1.

Strategic Plans - tactical action for the next phase   \n\n\nCompany-wide Information Technology infrastructure  \n\n \n\nThe study was designed to address the following issues relative\nto the implementation of an MISR company-wide IT infrastructure: Any work\nstation/PC to any (  application ) connectivity\n\n\nApplication manoeuvrability\n\n\nCo-existence of current and future systems\n\n\nEasily adopted by users\n\n\nFoundation of future business process re-engineering \n\n \n\nThe products of the project would be: A company-wide IT\ninfrastructure\n\n\nA framework that can serve the evolving the needs of the users .\n\n\nIt can also act as a catalyst for IT evolution within the user\norganization based on predefined technical standards\n\n\nA framework for the Information Superhighway (  Internet ) and other\nglobal information access systems\n\n\nA transport vehicle to support future application systems that\nwill run in a distributed environment   \n\n\nTechnology trends &ampersand; the Internet  \n\n \n\nThe MISR Project team studied the trends in technology (  details\nin Appendix I ) and found that historically , IT organizations have supported\ntheir users with computer resources (  in terms of MIPs and storage ) and\nbusiness applications (  life cycle development and maintenance services ) .\n\n\n \n\nOwing to the increasing commercial use of the Internet , the\nCommercial Internet Exchange was found in 1995 .\n\n\nIt interconnects major networking companies for commercial traffic .\n\n\nThe networking service is changing from the LAN-based file &ampersand; print ,\nsimple directory , Email and database and the Web-based searching and\npublishing application to Internet-based directory , security , groupware and\nstrategic business applications .\n\n\nIT organizations need to focus on the following: Professional\nservices such as system integration , business solution consulting , business\nre-engineering consulting and project management\n\n\nDistributed processing platforms and application services\n\n\nInformation sharing applications such as electronic mail and\ndocumentation collaboration\n\n\nSupply services for global computing via the Internet \n\n \n\nAdditionally , services will have to be packaged to meet the\nfragmented needs of different customers .\n\n\nRather than one size fits all , a family of services should be built\naround one product theme .\n\n\nThis service should include a low cost Spartan solution , a\nhigh-value solution , a high-end solution and a customizable solution . \n\n \n\nAccording to Boar (  5 ) \" Successful IMM organization in\nthe 90s - On one hand they will have to maintain , nourish , and extend the\nlarge embedded dbase of host-base systems which were built over the past 20\nto 30 years .\n\n\nOn the other hand , they will have to move aggressively to offer\nsolutions for high mobile and networked users deploying ever more\napplication-specific information technologies as a result of re-engineering &rdquo; .\n\n\n \n\nAll the building blocks for the future exist within most IT\norganizations today in some form (  see Appendix 2 ) . They are: Data\nprocessing\n\n\nEnd user computing\n\n\nDocument processing and job flow control\n\n\nGlobal electronic mail system\n\n\nIntelligent printing\n\n\nVoice mail and audio text applications\n\n\nImage processing and graphics   \n\n\nFuture strategies  \n\n \n\nTo address the question \"  How can we get there\n ? &rdquo; , a project has been initiated to \" Get , move and use\ninformation to support business process re-engineering\" .\n\n\nThe \" Desired future state position &rdquo; will be defined ,\nthen the techniques of value chain analysis , bottleneck analysis and CFS\nanalysis will be adopted . \n\n \n\nThe challenges that IT managers face nowadays are: ? Networking\nfor mission-critical applications .\n\n\nMaintaining a constant labour force while the workload increases\n\n\nThe continued growth of the network at a compound rate\n\n\nDemands from the users for a faster product time to market \n\n \n\nIT management needs to accommodate the growing users demands for\ncomputing and networking services while reducing costs .\n\n\nDuring the strategic analysis , we identified three major\nbottlenecks for success of the technology envelope model:  Application\ndevelopment\n\n\nrapid creation and amending of applications\n\n\nConfiguration management\n\n\nAdaptation of the technology envelope model to manage network\ncomputing in a multivendor environment\n\n\nOrderly evolution of network components\n\n\nNetwork computing operations , administration and maintenance that\nis daily end to end operation of client/server computing architecture \n\n \n\nThis can be divided into two levels: ? Platforms - address using\nthe technology envelope approach\n\n\nApplication - address using applications management \n\n \n\nAs discussed during the value chain analysis by Porter and\nMcKinsey , breaking these bottlenecks provides the basis of advantage .\n\n\nTo do this , the MIRS Project team adopted the value chain interlock\napproach , which makes the logistics as effective as possible and can offer\nbetter services and lower prices for comparable products .   \n\n\nStrategies pursued  \n\n \n\nThe following strategic items were identified for study by the\nMISR Project team: Technical services strategy\n\n\nGlobal electronic mail environment\n\n\nCommon networking software\n\n\nAccess security\n\n\nProvide Internet services\n\n\nDocument sharing and groupware\n\n\nInternal communication and electronic forms\n\n\nOffice automation and job flow control\n\n\nCost control (  deliver services in a cost effective manner )\n\n\nFocus - software , hardware , networking\n\n\nService level (  dependable and consistent services )\n\n\nReliability , availability , serviceability\n\n\nFocus - training , networking and system tuning .\n\n\nResearch and Development (  review , test and integrate new\ntechnology )\n\n\nFocus - network integration\n\n\nInter-Networking standards\n\n\nSystem hardware/software standards\n\n\nPABX/voice standards\n\n\nEnd user computing and graphics standards \n\n \n\nBased upon the above findings , the MISR Project team defined\nnetworking information infrastructure as the trend to be followed most\nclosely .\n\n\nEventually , all telecommunications service will need to be\nintegrated .\n\n\nThe work station of the future will be not only a multi-functional\ndata device , but a true multiple function facility for data and voice .\n\n\nInter-Networking services will remain the focus and make productive\nall capital in use within the organization .\n\n\nBuilding and managing the network through all demand levels is the\nfuture challenge . \n\n \n\nThe objective for the project team is to look at the various\nfactors in business process re-engineering and try to apply the relevant\ntechnical and management principles to handle the situation .\n\n\nThe team must provide a framework for the evolution of IT within the\norganization based on business and technical standards .\n\n\nIt should also reduce overall cost while improving performance .\n\n\nBy means of these organizational and technical innovations , IT\norganizations will provide user value through the use of Information\nTechnology . \n\n \n\nJust as an effective highway system is needed to facilitate\nmovement of people and goods , a company-wide information infrastructure is\nneeded to move enormous quantities of data and to support and stimulate the\ninnovative use of IT; to do this , the Technology Envelope model was\ndeveloped .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "2f84dcaa-11c1-47ef-993f-55f6a4b1fd2b", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.872522+00:00"}

{"text": "Hong Kong Police Force goes hi-tech in fight against crime \n \n\n\nBy Ir Jolly Wong \n\n \n\nOfficially formed in 1844 , when the first Police Force Ordinance\nwas passed , the Hong Kong Police Force (  HKPF ) has the distinction of being\none of the oldest , yet most modern , police force in the world .\n\n\nProtecting life and property in the 21st century , however , involves\nfar more than the latest concepts in law enforcement; state-of-the-art\ncommunications , computer and many other technologies are equally essential .\n\n\n \n\nMapped out as a priority in the Force 2002-2004 Strategic Action\nPlan , modernisation through the design and roll-out of the Third Generation\nCommand and Control Communications (  CC3 ) project represents the Force  ' s\nbiggest investment in technology to date .   \n\n\nBackground  \n\n \n\nThe usefulness of mobile radios and dispatchers was first\nrecognised by the public safety and emergency agencies .\n\n\nIn 1921 , the US Detroit Police Department started the first police\ncar radio dispatching system consisting of bulky vacuum-tube equipment that\nrequired powerful batteries .\n\n\nIt was 55 years later that the First Generation of Command and Control\nCommunication (  CC1 ) project was implemented by the HKPF , based on\nsolid-state electronics .\n\n\nThe Best Radio scheme and computer-assisted command and control\nsystems (  CACCS ) at police district control centers provided vastly improved\ncommand capability and permitted immediate access by field duties to all the\nsupport resources of the Force . \n\n \n\nCC1 was replaced by the Second Generation of Command and Control\nCommunications (  CC2 ) in 1990 , at a cost of around HK&dollar;410 million .\n\n\nIt comprises the Integrated Communications System (  commonly known as\nthe  ' Best Radio System ' ) , the 999 Emergency Services Telephone system and\nthe Enhanced Computer-assisted Command and Control System (  ECACCS ) . \n\n \n\nThe ECACCS comprises a back-end computer-aided dispatch system\nwith front-end console terminals installed at the three Regional Command and\nControl Centres (  RCCCs ) and local police stations to support controllers in\nresource deployment .\n\n\nDetails of all incidents reported through the Best Radio System , the\n999 Sub-system or at HKPF stations are input into ECACCS , which then\nverifies the location and automatically routes the information to the\nrelevant divisional console for deployment of resources . \n\n \n\nECACCS provides computer service coverage for both routine\npolicing as well as internal security and major incidents .\n\n\nIt has interfaces with the enhanced Police Operation Nominal Index\nComputer System (  EPONICS ) and the Transport Department  ' s Vehicle and\nLicensing Identification System (  VALID ) , as well as restricted access to\nthe Immigration Department  ' s Registration of Persons System (  ROPS ) ,\nproviding information on wanted and missing persons and vehicles of interest .\n \n\n \n\nCC2 will reach the end of its useful life by the end of 2004 .\n\n\nA provision of HK&dollar;948 million was approved in June 2001 for\nacquiring a new Third Generation and Control Communications System (  CC3 ) to\nreplace it .   \n\n\nNew features and major benefits  \n\n \n\nCC3 will be an integrated command and control system with the\nlatest communications and computer technologies .\n\n\nThe new digital radio infrastructure will be built to open standards\nand be capable of further expansion without the need for major changes and\nupgrades .\n\n\nIt will provide comprehensive radio coverage , both in terms of\ncross-communication amongst front-line officers of different formations and\nareas covered .\n\n\nFurthermore , its digitised , highly authenticated and encrypted air-\ninterface will greatly enhance protection against eavesdropping and\nunauthorized access .\n\n\nIt will not be possible for media reporters to tune into a police\nradio channel . \n\n \n\nThe new system will have data channels to allow transmission of\nnot only voice but also data and images .\n\n\nIts new digitised , encrypted transmission platform will greatly\nenhance protection against eavesdropping and unauthorised access .\n\n\nA Geographical Information System (  GIS ) with electronic mapping ,\nplotting of incidents/ places of HKPF interest will be installed to\nfacilitate the plotting of scenes of crimes and incidents on digitised maps\nin the RCCCs . \n\n \n\nCC3 will also employ Automatic Vehicle Location System (  AVLS)\nwhich , being integrated with the GIS , will enable the RCCCs to track the\nlocation of police emergency response vehicles , to improve their rapid\ndeployment to scenes of incidents .\n\n\nThis will facilitate more flexible and efficient deployment of\nresources and faster tactical response to incidents . \n\n \n\nCC3 is not only a digital radio infrastructure to open standard\nwhich allows an incremental approach to future system enhancement; it is also\nthe most cost-effective and scalable platform for public services\norganisations .\n\n\nIn the long run , it will be developed as a common radio platform\nshared by disciplinary agencies and government departments .\n\n\nFor everyday usage , each agency will have a section of the platform\nfor its exclusive use with absolute security .\n\n\nEach agency can independently manage its own subscribers and dynamic\ntalkgroups , and define its own communication and administrative operations\nautomatically like a Virtual Private Network (  VPN ) .\n\n\nDuring emergencies , rescue and disaster situations , the entire\nplatform can be programmed to facilitate inter-operability amongst various\nagencies and centralised command as well as effective and efficient control\nor deployment of resources . \n\n \n\nThe lessons of the September 11 terrorist attacks in the US\ntaught us that we could not prevent all crime or untoward incidents from\noccurring .\n\n\nWe can however in my view achieve the next best thing through the\ngreater use of advanced wireless communications technology to provide a\nprompt , firm , effective and professional response to those crimes and\nevents .    Improved public service  \n\n \n\nThe new system will improve police services to the public in the\nfollowing ways - (  a ) CC3 will allow direct access to various information\nsystems containing information on wanted or missing persons , stolen vehicles\n, crime reports and forged ID cards .\n\n\nSuch functionality will greatly improve the utilisation and\nefficiency of the new communications system and enhance the quality of\nservice provided by HKPF .\n\n\nFor example , ID checks will be conducted directly through data\ntransfer from Mobile Data Terminals (  MDT ) installed at police emergency\nresponse vehicles and beat radios instead of RCCC operators , as is currently\nthe case .\n\n\nIt is expected that the average time required for such a check will\nbe reduced by 10 to 15 seconds .\n\n\nAs a result , radio channels and RCCC operators will be freed up for\nvoice communications of high priority and other urgent tasks; (  b ) With the\nprovision of new MDTs , police emergency response vehicles can effectively\nfunction as mobile reporting centers for members of the public to make\nreports on the spot; (  c ) The new 999 Sun-system will provide a speedier\nresponse to emergency calls by showing details of the caller  ' s number and\naddress .\n\n\nIt will also incorporate additional call takers in each RCCC to deal\nwith sudden surges; and (  d ) Serving as an integrated communications platform\nfor beat patrol officers and patrols officers deployed to the Traffic Branch\n, PTU and EU , the new system will improve communications between front-line\nofficers and facilitate the efficient and effective deployment of resources\nduring emergencies and large-scale operations . \n\n \n\nA global tender for CC3 was issued on 1 February 2002 .\n\n\nThe new CC3 system is expected to go live in three phases: 3rd\nquarter 2004 for New Territories 4th quarter 2004 for Hong Kong Island \n1st quarter 2006 for Kowloon   \n\n\nInnovation award  \n\n \n\nAt the 3rd TETRA World Congress in Nice , France , in December\nlast year HKPF shared with delegates its first-mover experience in TETRA ( \nTerrestrial Trunked Radio ) technology in the Marine Police  ' s communication\nsystem .\n\n\nI made a presentation at the Congress covering the reasons for using\nTETRA , an open digital radio standard laid down in 1994 , and what we have\nlearnt from the TETRA system and the CC3 project , which will also utilize\nTETRA technology . \n\n \n\nRepresentatives of many industrialized countries were very\nsurprised at the speedy and advanced development of the communications system\nby the Force and were particularly interested in our approach to the many\ntechnical challenges . \n\n \n\nMore than 900 delegates attended the congress to discuss issues\naffecting TETRA projects in the UK , Belgium , Holland and Germany , the\nsuccess of which will greatly facilitate police radio communications in\nEurope . \n\n \n\nThe HKPF won the Most Innocative TETRA Service Award for the\nAutomatic Vessel Location and Messaging System used by the Marine Police at\nthe congress for its innovative use of IP (  Internet Protocol ) over the TETRA\nnetwork to transmit data . \n\n \n\nThe system , believed to be the most advanced of its kind in the\nworld , beat off stiff competition from police systems in Western Australia\nand the UK .\n\n\nTETRA primarily handles voice transmission , but the network is also\nused to transmit IP data .\n\n\nThis new approach provides continuous and accurate position updates\nof Marine Police launches .\n\n\nUsers can also send word documents and photographs via the radio\nnetwork . \n\n \n\nThe congress gave HKPF an opportunity to share its knowledge and\npresent itself as a recognized user of advanced communications for police\nservices . \n\n \n\nOur Commissioner Tang Yam-pui pkedged in a  ' Letter to Hong Kong'\nbroadcast on RTHK Radio 3 earlier this year that the Force would continue to\nimprove its equipment and quality of service .\n\n\nEnabling technology will have a big role to play in the fulfillment\nof this pledge .\n\n\nHKPF will endeavour to build the very best computer and\ncommunications system in line with global developments and , in some areas ,\nbecome a world leader .  \n\n\nAbout the author: Ir Jolly Wong is the head of the CC3 project team .\n\n\nHe can be contacted at wongckjolly@police.gov.hk .   \n\n\nProcessing utilities information on the Internet  \n\n \n\nEverybody in Hong Kong is familiar with the nuisance of road\nexcavations .\n\n\nThe noise , the dust , the traffic jams and , worst of all , the poor\nplanning of such works that often leads to repeated disruptions on the same\nroads . \n\n \n\nHelp is at hand . \n\n \n\nThe University of Hong Kong  ' s Jockey Club Research &ampersand; Information\nCentre for Landslip Prevention &ampersand; Land Development has come up with a system\ncalled the Electronic Mark Plant Query System (  EMPQS ) to facilitate the\nprocessing of information on underground utilities .  \n\n \n\nAccording to the university , the system provides a one-step\nservice for collecting utility services information via secure electronic\nmeans .\n\n\nIt allows such information collection to be completed in seven\nworking days instead of the 21 days it currently takes using manual means .\n\n\nThe system is said to be fast , secure , environmentally friendly and\ncost-effective; it is estimated that the EMPQS can reduce operation costs by\n90% . \n\n \n\nFollowing registration , users will be able to use the system to\nobtain information on underground utilities at a specific location from the\nrelevant utility operators .\n\n\nThe system functions in a coordinating role by providing a platform\nfor the exchange of information between those carrying out roadworks and\nutility operators .\n\n\nTo ensure security , the system uses a Secure Socket Layer for data\ntransmission and digital certificates for data authentication .\n\n\nThere is also a firewall to protect the system from outside attacks .\n\n\n \n\nDeveloped at a cost of HK&dollar;25 million , which was denoted\nby the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust , the system has already won the\nsupport of Hong Kong Cable Television Ltd , New T&T Company Ltd , New World\nTelephone Ltd and the Transport Department .\n\n\nThe university is hoping to secure other utility operators as\npartners . \n\n\n\n  \n\n\nE-Commerce: Technologies and Perspectives  \n\n \n\nTechnical 2000 Programme Chairman Ir Jolly Wong , who chaired a\npanel discussion at the Asia-Pacific Electronic Symposium , share his and\nother expert  ' s observations on new e-commerce technologies and their impact .\n\n\n \n\nWith global Internet traffic doubling every three months and more\nand more demand for broadband , communications via optical network - which\nallows the transmission of data , video and voice in the form of light over\nglass , instead of electrons over copper - is becoming the choice for telecom\ncompanies . \n\n \n\nAt the Asia-Pacific Electronic Symposium 2000 Panel Discussion ,\nCharles Mok , Chairman of the Hong Kong Internet Service Providers (  HKISP)\nAssociation , spoke about optical networking as the phenomenal trend in the\nnew economy . \n\n \n\n\" Consider this: it takes seven hours to download a movie\nover a high-speed cable modem connection now and an how with an Ethernet\nconnection .\n\n\nWith optical connections , a user can download a movie in just four\nseconds , &rdquo; he noted . \n\n \n\nSpending on optical networking gears is expected to rocket to\nUS&dollar;44 billion this year , compared with US&dollar;33 billion last year\n, and to rise to US&dollar;89 billion in 2003 , according to market\nresearchers .\n\n\nLeading companies in this core enabling technology include: Ciena ,\nCorvis , JDS Uniphase , ONI Systems , Nortel Networks and Sycamore Networks .\n \n\n\n The second wave  \n\n \n\nAfter the dotcom meltdown and the ASP hype , people begin to ask\nif the second wave of e-commerce business is coming ?\n\n\nAs many symposium delegates agreed , Customer Relationship Management\n( CRM ) system may be the answer as companies make the strategic move from\nbeing produce-oriented to being customer-oriented . \n\n \n\nCRM has been used in the old economy for some time: call centre\nis a typical part of the CRM solution for many industries .\n\n\nSales automation , marketing campaign management and customer\nservices are the major components of CRM , although they might not be well\nintegrated in the past .\n\n\nCRM is not as popular as certain accounting systems in use today\nbecause it is still quite new to many companies . \n\n \n\nThanks to the internet , people have developed new ways of doing\nbusiness which transcends boundary and allow them to conduct business without\ntalking to the customer fact to face .\n\n\nAs a result , a new generation of CRM is required: eCRM , which is a\nweb-based CRM .\n\n\nWith improvements in wireless technology , eCRM will become more\npowerful , especially in the area of sales automation . \n\n \n\nSuccessful implementation of eCRM requires the reengineering of a\ncorporation .\n\n\nIn other words , you need to make changes to the management and\ncreate a new culture as well .\n\n\nFor example , how do salesmen usually treat their clients ?\n\n\nDo they treat information as their own property ?\n\n\nDo they disclose 100% information to the company ?\n\n\nIt is definitely a challenge to management to ensure the salesforce\nis able to meet client requirements; this can be achieved by feeding all\ninformation into the CRM system , thus automating the entire salesforce .\n\n\n \n\nNowadays there are many players in the market covering CRM , eCRM\nand CRA (  Customer relationship analytic ) because both the old economy and\nthe new economy have such needs .\n\n\nWith the strong growth in internet and wireless technologies , CRM\nwill become one of the high growth area in the IT industry in the coming\nyears .  \n\n\n The hype cycle for e-commerce technologies  \n\n \n\nOn the advancement and focuses of e-commerce technologies , Prof\nDavid Yai of CUHK and Michael Chan , managing vice president of Gartner Group\nHong Kong Ltd used the same model to classify e-commerce technologies into\nthe following 3 categories: Core Technology (  for internet/ information\nsystem technology); Business Technology (  or enterprise solution\ntechnology); Emerging Technology (  or emerging e-commerce-centric\ntechnology ) . \n\n \n\nCore technology is a technology which enables business\napplications .\n\n\nJava , XML , Smart Card , PKI are all considered core technologies .\n\n\n \n\nBusiness technology refers to technologies that have direct\nimpact on day-to-day business .\n\n\nCRM , Supply Chain Management (  SCM ) , Electronic Bill Payment and\nPresentation (  EBPP ) are some examples . \n\n \n\nEmerging technology refers to those technology that are still\nunder research and development or simply not yet widely commercialised , such\nas Bluetooth , WAP , Jini , Voice Portals , etc . \n\n \n\nAccording to Mr Chan , Gartner has developed a Hype Curve for\neach technology which provides a snapshot of the position of a set of\ntechnologies in the inevitable cycle of hype and disillusionment that\naccompanies a technology path to maturity .\n\n\nThe Hype Curve consists of the following phases: Technology\ntrigger: A breakthrough , public demonstration , product launch or other\nevent generates significant press and industry interest .\n\n\nPeak of inflated expectations: During this phase of\nover-enthusiasm and unrealistic projections , a flurry of well-publicised\nactivity by technology leaders results in some successes but more failures as\nthe technology is pushed to its limits .\n\n\nThe only enterprises making money are conference organizers and\nmagazine publishers .\n\n\nTrough of disillusionment: Because the technology does not live up\nto its over-inflated expectations , it rapidly becomes unfashionable and the\npress abandons the topic .\n\n\nSlope of enlightenment: focused experimentation and solid hard\nwork by an increasingly diverse range of organisations lead to a true\nunderstanding of the technology  ' s applicability , risks and benefits .\n\n\nCommercial off-the-shelf methodologies and tools become available to\nease the development process .\n\n\nPlateau of productivity: The real-world benefits of the technology\nare demonstrated and accepted .\n\n\nTools and methodologies are increasingly stable as they enter their\nsecond and third generation .\n\n\nThe final height of the plateau varies according to whether the\ntechnology is broadly applicable or benefits only a niche market . \n\n \n\n\" The bottom line is: Enterprises should be selectively\naggressive in the early adoption of technologies with the potential for high\nimpact , but should ride out the Hype Cycle for less-critical technologies ,\n&rdquo; Michael Chan said .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "5addac5d-f903-44c2-b3b6-1a4a27b32a13", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.875492+00:00"}
{"text": "Hari Harilela   \n\n\n  The 81-year-old epitomises the best of Hong Kong  ' s rags to riches\nstories .\n\n\nHe was seven years old when the Wall Street crash of 1929 wiped out\nhis father  ' s successful export business to the United States .\n\n\nBorn in Sind province in India , Harilela moved to Canton with his\nfamily at an early age , and to Hong Kong in 1929 .\n\n\nOne of eight children (  six boys and two girls ) , he went from hawking\nin the streets to heading a family business , which today includes clothing ,\nreal estate and hotels on three continents .\n\n\nThe self-taught multimillionaire tells Virginia Maher how his father  ' s\npersonal philosophy , luck in business , good friends and sheer hard work got\nhim to where he is today and how he has no intention of retiring . \n\n\n\n \" I have always lived by my father Naroomal  ' s simple philosophy .\n\n\nHe said make all the profit you want , but don't be greedy and don't\ncheat .\n\n\nOur mark-up was always 33 per cent , which really translated into 20\nper cent profit after our overheads had been taken into account .\n\n\nMy father hated bargaining , and this refusal to haggle and his\nhonesty were what launched us into the world of business after World War II .\n\n\n\n Before all this , we went through a period of extreme poverty in the\nearly 30s .\n\n\nMy mother came to Hong Kong from Canton in December 1929 with my\nolder brother George , my younger brother Peter and myself .\n\n\nMy father had had to close down his business both in Canton and here .\n\n\nHe exported antique furniture and jade , and other luxury items ,\nmostly to America . \n\n\n My father , George and I used to do our hawking in Shamshuipo in 1933-34 .\n\n\nWe spent many days sitting in the hot sun outside the Shamshuipo\nbarracks , selling things such as soap and singlets .\n\n\nOne day , an officer took pity on us and suggested we go into the\nbarracks and sit in the shade .\n\n\nThat was how we became established .\n\n\nWe were the very first allowed into the officers ' mess and from that\nsmall beginning , we grew to become suppliers to the British Army. \n\n\n During the war years we sold to the Japanese things such as old sewing\nmachines , the foot-pedal ones .\n\n\nWe painted and rebuilt the worktables and sold to them as new .\n\n\nTimes were hard under the Japanese .\n\n\nThere was starvation in Hong Kong .\n\n\nMy father was beaten half to death for not opening the front door\nquickly enough when they came in the middle of the night .\n\n\nJapanese soldiers lurked in the shadows at dusk and then beat you up\nfor not kowtowing to them .\n\n\nI was hit twice on the back of the head with rifle butts .\n\n\nI didn't bow because I didn't see them , but there was no arguing\nwith them . \n\n\n My mother Devi Bai was a very pious woman and no stranger who came to our\ndoor was ever turned away without a cup of tea and a biscuit , even when we\nhad very little .\n\n\nWe had this small shop at 733 Nathan Road in Mongkok .\n\n\nBus drivers and other people always knew they could count on my\nmother for kindness .\n\n\nDuring the war , every shop in that area was looted , except for this\nlittle place .\n\n\nAfter the war , when we went back , we found a red band across the\nentrance and when we opened the shop , everything was there .\n\n\nWe were able to keep going by selling the goods , which had remained\nuntouched throughout the war years. \n\n\n The British returned in 1945 and set up their headquarters in Mody Road .\n\n\nThey knew us by name and asked us to become their food suppliers .\n\n\nThey provided two lorries and we went to Tai Po to get food supplies .\n\n\nThe army had no money , so for payment they opened their warehouse\nand told us to help ourselves .\n\n\nThis was barter before the authorities decided what currency was\ngoing to be used .\n\n\nWe took only two cases of whisky and 20 cartons of Japanese\ncigarettes each time .\n\n\nAfter three months , when their quartermasters went over the deals\nmade , they discovered we did not take advantage of them and we were given\ncontracts to do the laundry for the army and provide them with uniforms .\n\n\nFrom that came the contracts for the air force and when the US Army\nasked the British Army for suppliers for their stores , we were given the\ncontracts for Okinawa and Guam .\n\n\nWe are now the largest custom tailors in Hong Kong .\n\n\nOur 900 tailors produce 600 suits daily . \n\n\n By the late 50s I decided it was time to diversify and began looking at\nreal estate .\n\n\nMy brothers did not agree , but I thought we had to have something\nelse , for when the British forces pulled out .\n\n\nI became a hotelier by accident .\n\n\nI owned No 30 Nathan Road , and two friends owned 32-34 .\n\n\nThey wanted to build a hotel and asked to buy my property .\n\n\nI refused to sell , but said I wanted one-third equity in their\nventure .\n\n\nAs the project went ahead , I bought out one partner and then the\nother .\n\n\nThat was 1960 .\n\n\nI was able to do it because the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank\nguaranteed me a personal loan of &dollar;7.8 million . \n\n\n I didn't know anything about the hotel business when I began in 1963 .\n\n\nI was a partner with Chinese friends .\n\n\nWe called ourselves the Golden Group .\n\n\nIt was my Chinese partners who taught me to look out for all the\ntraders ' tricks .\n\n\nFor example , they made me weigh every delivery and that  ' s how I\nlearned that people only gave me 90 catties of meat when I was paying for 100\ncatties .\n\n\nThey showed me how to recognise pork that had been injected with\nwater to make it heavier . . . all these things , they taught me . \n\n\n Hotels are most interesting because you meet people from different\ncountries .\n\n\nIt keeps you young and alive , always alive .\n\n\nFrom that first Imperial Hotel , we now have the Golden Mile Holiday\nInn in Hong Kong and hotels in Singapore , Bangkok , Penang , Montreal ,\nSydney and London. \n\n\n How did I do it ?\n\n\nI learned a lot , by reading - everything I could lay my hands on ,\nand I studied a lot .\n\n\nI learned most when I was appointed Justice of the Peace in 1963 .\n\n\nI took the chance to visit reform schools and gained insight from the\nTenancy Tribunal .\n\n\nI went to the New Territories , and did not allow landlords there to\ntake advantage of their tenants .\n\n\nI knew what it was like to be one of the common folk and that helped\nme . \n\n\n One of my proudest achievements was when the British government agreed to\nlisten to my views about young offenders .\n\n\nI insisted that offences committed under the age of 18 were pranks\nand should not be considered part of a record of offences . \n\n\n I don't believe in this business of ethnicity .\n\n\nI am not happy when people ask me to give scholarships to students\nbecause they are Indian .\n\n\nI believe in giving in the place that I made my money .\n\n\nThis is where I made my money and this is where I give the most help .\n\n\nI am a Hong Kong person .\n\n\nHong Kong is my home . &rdquo; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Eugene Yourieff   \n\n\n  When the Japanese attacked Hong Kong in World War II ,\nUkraine-born Eugene Yourieff joined the Volunteers but was wounded and\nincarcerated for 44 months at Shamshuipo Camp .\n\n\nArriving in Hong Kong from China in 1938 , he expected a much quieter\nlife , working for the French shipping line Mesagrie Maritimes and the\nfledgling Air France .\n\n\nYourieff , 88 , tells Virginia Maher how he was the first to spot the\nincoming Japanese on December 8 , 1941 .  \n\n\n \" I was a lance bombardier with the 1st Battery , the (  Hong Kong]\nVolunteers stationed at Cape D'Aguilar .\n\n\nThe day war broke out I had the dog  ' s duty - the overnight shift .\n\n\nAs the light came up at dawn , I saw the planes approaching from the\ndirection of Macau .\n\n\nI sent for the officers , but by the time they arrived the planes had\ndisappeared .\n\n\nWe learned later that they had bombed the airport and Shamshuipo .\n\n\nWe also knew the next day that the Japanese had arrived by land .\n\n\nAll our defences were pointed out to sea . \n\n\n We stayed at our post until we got a call on December 19 .\n\n\nOur instructions were to destroy our big guns , knock out the\nlighthouse at Waglan Island (  off Shek O ) and then fight our way to Stanley .\n\n\nWe didn't know at the time that the enemy was already on the island .\n\n\nIt was a rude shock . \n\n\n Our first casualty was Peter Wilson .\n\n\nHe went to Stanley to buy food and disappeared without a trace .\n\n\nWe arrived at Stanley the same day and , at first , we had little to\ndo .\n\n\nWe watched the funny bombs dropped by the Japanese planes hanging in\nthe air before coming down at an angle .\n\n\nThen on Christmas Day we had to support the Middlesex Regiment in the\ndefence of Stanley .\n\n\nOne of our number was shot between the eyes .\n\n\nThere was no blood coming out .\n\n\nHe just fell forward .\n\n\nThat was the moment war came home to us with a thud .\n\n\nThe fighting continued all night .\n\n\nWe were 69 people all together .\n\n\nBy morning only 18 of us were left alive , of whom five , including\nmyself , were wounded .\n\n\nThe Japanese had come around from behind our position . \n\n\n We were stuck between the prison and the cemetery in Stanley .\n\n\nThe seriously wounded were finished off by the Japanese .\n\n\nTheir own people were not so lucky .\n\n\nThey threw them , still alive , into the fire .\n\n\nThe Japanese said the city had given up .\n\n\nWe tried calling Command Headquarters and got \" \nMoshi moshi  \" (  \" Hello , hello\" ) on the line , so we knew\nit was true . \n\n\n I was wounded in the left hand .\n\n\nI was treated at the British Military Hospital (  BMH ) in Bowen Road .\n\n\nI went from the BMH to Shamshuipo Camp in February and stayed there\nuntil liberation .\n\n\nAt Shamshuipo , we slept on the floor head-to-foot .\n\n\nThere was more space when people started dying .\n\n\nWe were fed two meals a day - lunch and dinner of rice and rice .\n\n\nWhen people started escaping we were given only theburnt dregs of\nthe rice .\n\n\nI shrank from my normal 164 lbs to 72 lbs (  from 74.5kg to 32.7kg]\nwithboots on .\n\n\nDuring the day we were sent out in work gangs to fix the roads .\n\n\nWe worked when it was wet and drizzling and there was dysentery in\nthe camps .\n\n\nDysentery killed a lot .\n\n\nThe prisoners didn't fight over food , but all the dogs disappeared\nalmost overnight .\n\n\nWhen I started to go blind from the dysentery , I managed to get\neggs and cod liver oil in return for the gold fillings in my teeth .\n\n\nI found true friendships in the camps even among the Japanese . \n\n\n On August 15 , 1945 , I knew something serious had happened .\n\n\nOne of the guards came and said: \" All finished , all\nfinished\" .\n\n\nAt that moment I felt elation and also fear of the unknown .\n\n\nI went to see my office .\n\n\nMy boss , a Frenchman , had been beheaded (  because the Japanese\nbelieved him to be a spy ) .\n\n\nThe office had been broken into and things scattered , but some\npapers had been transferred to a bank .\n\n\nThe Swiss consul told me my home in Tsim Sha Tsui had been ransacked .\n\n\nI left Hong Kong in 1945 to be demobilised in England .\n\n\nIt took 30 days to get there .\n\n\nI stopped off in Basra and Cairo on the way . \n\n\n Although I came from Ukraine , I am Russian , not Ukrainian .\n\n\nMy mother decided to join my uncle in Shandong after my father died .\n\n\nShe took my three brothers , sister and myself to China because my\nuncle was the Russian  charge d'affaires  there .\n\n\nWe arrived in China in 1924 and I stayed until 1938 , when I came\ndown to Hong Kong , where my uncle had arranged my job as a passenger\nassistant with the French shipping company Mesagrie Maritimes . \n\n\n My starting pay was &dollar;300 per month and this was increased to\n&dollar;350 after three months.On that money you could charter a yacht .\n\n\nI sent &dollar;50 a month to my mother in China .\n\n\nI had spacious quarters in Mody Road in Tsim Sha Tsui , and three\nservants who were paid a total of &dollar;30 , the same as the rent .\n\n\nOn weekends my friends and I used to rent a car , with petrol and\ninsurance for &dollar;8 from Harper  ' s Garage , which had outlets on Hong\nKong Island and Kowloon .\n\n\nThis was usually shared between two or three boys .\n\n\nThe girls brought the food .\n\n\nIn Hong Kong then you worked in no air-conditioning and at 11pm ,\neverything stopped .\n\n\nSo after 11pm , we all gathered at one of our places until 2am or so .\n\n\nIf we wanted to go sailing , the cost of a boat for a weekend was\n&dollar;33 for the boat boy and his son - more than my three servants ' pay\nfor the month . \n\n\n I am now the longest serving member of the Yacht Club .\n\n\nI joined in April 1938 .\n\n\nOne or two years after the war , 80 members of the club started the\nWater Police .\n\n\nWe didn't like the name , so it was changed to the Marine Police .\n\n\nIn 1952 , I joined a Swiss company dealing mainly in imports of\nphotographic equipment and pharmaceuticals . \n\n\n I met Tina Lillian Whitehrow at an engagement party in 1950 .\n\n\nShe spent a two-year tour here , working at the US consulate , and\nthen another year in Lebanon .\n\n\nShe liked Hong Kong and I asked her to come back .\n\n\nWe were married in 1953 .\n\n\nWe have two sons .\n\n\nThey attended Peak School and then Island School .\n\n\nWe didn't send them to boarding school because we wanted to bring\nthem up ourselves .\n\n\nIn 1969 , my younger son , David , and I formed our own export\ncompany .\n\n\nMy son is now my boss . &rdquo;", "subdomain":

{"text": "The greatness in the number of vocabulary in the English language\nis amazing to most learners which are foreign to the language itself .\n\n\nIn fact , the greatness in the number of vocabulary is not entirely\nunique to English .\n\n\nIt happens in many other languages such as German , French , many\nother European languages , Chinese , ...... , etc .\n\n\nBut , by what means can we classify a word as a member of the English\nlanguage ?\n\n\nThere is no simple answers to this question .\n\n\nAs Crystal ( 1990 , 32 ) has once put it this way : \n \n\n\n How many words are there in English ?\n\n\nThis apparently simple little question turns out to be surprisingly\ncomplicated .\n\n\nEstimates have been given ranging from half a million to over two\nmillion .\n\n\nIt partly depends on what you count as English words , and partly on\nwhere you go looking for them .  ( Crystal , 1990 , 32 )\n \n \n\nIn fact , Crystal has given us some insight on this &longdash;\n\n\nit depends on what you count as English words .\n\n\nTherefore , there must be some criteria for us to regard a word as a\nmember of the English language .\n\n\nHowever , this becomes an extremely difficult task since there is no\noutward limit of the English vocabulary .\n\n\nAs Murray ( 1888 , 59 ) has said in his introduction to\n A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles , Vol. 1 , 1888 :\n \n \n\n\nThe vocabulary of a widely-diffused and highly-cultivated living\nlanguage is not a fixed quantity circumscribed by definite limits .......\n\n\nthe English vocabulary contains a nucleus or central mass of many\nthousand words whose &lsquo; Anglicity &rsquo; is unquestioned .  \n( Murray , 1888 , 59 ) \n \n\nThe &lsquo; common &lsquo; words of the English language are\nlinked on many different aspects , such as words from science , new\ntechnology , slang , dialect , foreign origin , etc .\n\n\nThere is actually  \" no defining line in any direction :\nthe circle of the English language has a well-defined centre but no\ndiscernible circumference .  \" ( Murray , 1888 , 59\n)\n\n\nTherefore , by knowing all words , if possible , does not really mean\nthat one can say which word is a member of the English language . \n \n\nAs such , the concern in this essay is not on the origin of each\nword .\n\n\nRather , it concerns how we can explain a word as the member of the\nEnglish language . \n \n\nOne obvious explanation may be in terms of historical context .\n\n\nAs  \" the vocabulary of English is richly heterogeneous\n, luxuriant in its profuseness and quirkish in its changes of meaning \"\n ( Hughes , 1988 . 2 ) , one can assume that we can\nexplain which word is a member of the English language by referring to\nspecific historical events which led to expansion of the &lsquo;\ncircumference &rsquo; of English vocabulary .\n\n\nAs Hughes ( 1988 , 3-4 ) also says ,  \" In\nit can be traced the differing linguistic legacies left by a conquering\nNorman elite , a decimated Celtic minority , a partially successful invasion\nof Norse rivals , and a series of four major Latin influxes which can be\nrespectively characterised ( in terms of historical periods )\nas basic , religious , bookish and scientific . \" \n\n\nThis probably illustrates the importance of putting historical\ncontext into explaining the constituent of English vocabulary .\n\n\nAnd , it is hoped that some major historical eras and events\ndiscussed in the following part can give an insight to what contributes a\nword to be a member in the English language . \n \n\nVocabulary in the English language is not homogeneous in nature .\n\n\nThis means that , in its simplest sense , the whole group of the\nEnglish vocabulary we use today does not only come from one origin .\n\n\nIn fact , to a certain extent , the making of the English language\nwas contributed by several invasions &longdash; namely Germanic , Viking and\nNorman invasions .\n\n\nUnder each important historical era of invasion , English underwent\ncertain changes &longdash; since each invasion had great impact on the\nlanguage generally used by the public , political organisation , culture ,\neducation and social life ...... , and many other social aspects that we\ncan imagine .\n\n\nHowever , this does not mean that the language set up previously was\ntotally destroyed and a new one , under a new culture , was imposed .\n\n\nIt simply means that the English language was modelled and changed\nunder the impact of these three invasions .\n\n\nTherefore , we can say that , from the perspective of political\ninvasion , the English language that we are using nowadays is heterogeneous\nin nature .\n\n\nAnd , we can use these historical events to explain the constituent\nof English vocabulary since many new words might be added into the existing\nlanguage in each invasion . \n \n\nActually , the word  \" &lsquo; English &rsquo;\n\"  comes from the name of one of the Germanic tribes which\ninvaded the island during fifth and sixth centuries : the Angles .\n\n\nThe other two tribes which invaded England at approximately the same\ntime were the Jutes and the Saxons .\n\n\nAccording to Jackson ( 1988 , 19 ) , the Angles settled\nin the areas of England to the north of the River Thames whereas the Jutes\nsettled in what is now Kent and the remaining part was occupied by Saxons .\n\n\nThey probably spoke mutually intelligible dialects .\n\n\nAnd , the word \" &lsquo; Englisc &lsquo; \" was\ncommonly used as the term for this language .\n\n\nWe often refer to this period as &lsquo; Anglo-Saxon &rsquo; and the\nwords originated from this period as the &lsquo; Anglo-Saxon &rsquo; words of\nthe English vocabulary .\n\n\nAccording to Jackson ( 1988 , 18 ) , from this period\nuntil the end of the eleventh century , following the Norman Conquest , is\ntraditionally called the &lsquo; Old English &rsquo; period of the language .\n\n \n\nThe vocabulary used in everyday conversation which is Old English\norigin is frequent .\n\n\nThis is explained by the fact that Anglo-Saxon words are frequently\nused , for example ,  \" have \"  ,  \"\ntake \"  or  \" to \"  .\n\n\n( Jackson , 1988 , 23 ) However ,  \" they\nare in a minority as far as the vocabulary of modern English as a whole is\nconcerned . \"  ( Jackson , 1988 , 23 )\n\n\nThe word stock of Old English was more Germanic than the English we\nuse today .\n\n\nIt is observed that many Anglo-Saxon words are  \"\ncharacteristically associated with a particular stylistic level , namely that\nof informality or of colloquial language \" ,  for example ,\n  \" \" pluck \" , \" sweat \"\n, \" guts \" , \" clothes \" , \" climb\n\" , \" begin \" , \" book \" ,\n\" pride \" , \" lung \" \" , \n etc . ( Jackson , 1988 , 24 )\n\n\nThe word \" informality &lsquo; \" here demonstrates a\nrelative concept &longdash;\n\n\nthose words which we said as &lsquo; informal &rsquo; are informal\nwhen they are compared with their borrowed equivalents ( from French ,\nLatin and Greek particularly ) .\n\n\nTherefore , we  \" associate words of Anglo-Saxon origin\nwith straightforward , direct speaking in face-to-face interaction . \"\n ( Jackson , 1988 , 23 )\n\n\nOther common Anglo-Saxon words include :  \" eat\n\" , \" drink \" , \" speak \" ,\n\" work house \" , \" door \" , \" man\n\" , \" woman \" , \" husband \" ,\n\" wife \" ,  etc . ( Allen , 1990 , xii )\n\n\nMost words here are concerned with daily life of common people .\n\n\nIn short , the invasion of Germanic tribes created a basis for the\nEnglish word stock and is helpful for us to explain the constituent of\nEnglish vocabulary . \n \n\nAnother influence on the vocabulary of English as a result of\ninvasion came from the Danish and other Scandinavian invaders of the ninth\nand tenth centuries , collectively called Vikings .\n\n\nDuring their period of occupation , many Scandinavian ( Old\nNorse ) words were taken into English .\n\n\nHowever , it is sometimes difficult to estimate the influence of Old\nNorse because  \" Old Norse was also a Germanic language , many\nwords were similar to the Anglo-Saxon ones . \"  ( Allen\n, 1990 , xiii )\n\n\nMany identifiable Old Norse words are still in use :  \"\ncall \" , \" take \" , \" law \" ,\n\" leg \" , \" egg \" , \" root\n\" , \" window \"  , place-names such as those\nending in  \" - thwaite \"  and  \" -\nthorpe \"  and in  \" - by \"  (\nGrimsby , Rugby , Whitby , and so on ) , and in street-names ending in\n \" - gate \"  ( from the Old Norse \n\" gata \"  meaning \" &lsquo; street &rsquo;\n\" ) such as  Coppergate  in York . ( Allen ,\n1990 , xiii )\n\n\nHowever , as pointed out also by Allen in the same book , one very\nimportant effect on English was the gradual disappearance of many\nword-endings , or inflections .\n\n\nThis was because , as aforementioned , Anglo-Saxon English words was\nvery similar to Old Norse words .\n\n\nBut , only the inflections , to a certain extent , hindered their\nmutual understanding .\n\n\nThe gradual disappearance of word inflection continued for hw1dreds\nof years into Middle English period .\n\n\nThe most important fact here is that the Scandinavian invasion\nresulted in implantation of many Old Norse words into English . \n \n\nAnother major influence made by invasion happened after 1066 when\nWilliam of Normandy defeated the English king , Harold , at the Battle of\nHastings .\n\n\nThe invasion by French-speaking Normans brought  \" a\ntransforming Roman influence on the language . \"  (\nAllen , 1990 , xiii )\n\n\nThe Roman languages included French , Italian , Spanish , Portuguese\n, and Romanian .\n\n\nThey have their roots in the spoken Latin .\n\n\nMany words were borrowed during this period :  \" infant\n\" , \" commence \" , \" cordial \" ,\n\" felicity \"  , etc . &longdash; normally on a \n\" &lsquo; higher &rsquo; , more formal stylistic level \" \n( Jackson , 1988 , 26 ) than their equivalents in English .\n\n\nMore important aspect is the borrowing of French words to refer\nFrench-dominated areas of life : in law :  \" justice \"\n ,  \" jury \"  ,  \" judgement\n\"  ,  \" estate \"  ,  \"\nequity \"  ,  \" lease \"  , \n\" legacy \"  ,  \" libel \"  ,\n \" perjury \"  &semi; in gastronomic terms : \n\" grill \"  ,  \" fry \"  , \n\" stew \"  ,  \" boil \"  \nand   \" roast \"  &semi; in hunting : \n\" chase \"  ,  \" quarry \"  ,\n \" scent \"  and  \" track \"\n &semi; in nobility terms :  \" prince \"  ,\n \" duke \"  ,  \" viscount \"\n and  \" baron \"  &semi; and in terms of combat\nand chivalry :  \" courtly \"  ,  \"\namiable \"  ,  \" favour \"  , \n\" lance \"  ,  \" generous \" \nand  \" enemy \"  . ( Jackson , 1988 , 26-7\n)\n\n\nWords derived from French are sometimes recognised by their spelling\n, for example , the  \" - ity \"  endings of \n\" felicity \"  and  \" equity \"\n , the  \" - our \"  ending of  \"\nfavour \"  , or the  \" - ant \"  of\n \" infant \"  . ( Jackson , 1988 , 27\n) \n \n\nAs what Allen ( 1990 , xiv ) says ,  \"\nthis mixture of conquering peoples and their languages &longdash; Germanic ,\nScandinavian , and Romance &longdash; has had a decisive effect on the forms\nof words in modern English . \" \n\n\nMany modern English words can be traced back in order to find out\ntheir origins .\n\n\nThey become a member of the English language in their historical\ncontext .\n\n\nMany example have been just given .\n\n\nWhat is worth mentioning again is that these invasions did not only\nhave effects on politics , they also had effects on culture , religion and\nall aspects of social life .\n\n\nAnd , language may act as the mirror which can reflect the influence\nat that time .\n\n\nThis also applies in the discussion of some other historical events\nwhich are going to be dealt with . \n \n\nThere are other historical events related to the explanation of\nthe constituent of the English vocabulary which seem to be necessary to\nmention . \n \n\nWhen we talk about invasion , we normally refer to its political\nimplication .\n\n\nHowever , invasion can be in terms of culture .\n\n\nThe Renaissance which began at the end of Middle Ages and blossomed\nfrom the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries was of this kind .\n\n\nAt that time , there was a  \" rediscovery in Europe of\nthe culture and history of the ancient Greek and Roman worlds &rdquo;\n , and this  \" exercised a further Romanizing influence\non English . \"  ( Allen , 1990 , xvi )\n\n\nThe language used by many people who received higher education ,\nincluding scholars , writers , etc , was Latin .\n\n\nWords such as  \" arena \"  ,  \"\ndexterity \"  ,  \" excision \"  , \n\" genius \"  ,  \" habitual \" \n,  \" malignant \"  ,  \" specimen\n\"  and  \" stimulus \"  came into the\nEnglish language . ( Allen , 1990 , xvi )\n\n\nThere is a tendency to emphasise Greek and Latin origin of words .\n\n\nThis accounts for the  \" b \"  in \n\" debt \"  ,  \" l \"  in \n\" fault \"  ,  \" s \"  in \n\" isle \"  ,  \" p \"  in \n\" receipt \"  .\n\n\nOther words introduced in this period included  \"\ndemocratic \"  ,  \" juvenile \"  , \n\" sophisticated \"  ,  \" imaginary\n\"  , etc . ( Hughes , 1988 , 4 )\n\n\nThis particular historical era demonstrated its effects on the\nintroduction of many new words into the English language . \n \n\nThe development of printing from the fifteenth century might have\na minor effect on English vocabulary .\n\n\nMany foreign printers used rules of their own languages ( not\nEnglish ) to make the English language more &lsquo; uniform &rsquo; in\nspelling . \n\n\n \" The unnecessary insertion of h in ghost , for\nexample , is due to ( William ) Caxton , ( the first\nEnglish printer ) , and the change had its effect on other words such\nas ghastly and ( perhaps ) ghetto . \"  \n( Allen . 1990 , xv )\n\n\nGenerally speaking , printing had a major impact on the &lsquo;\nstandardisation &rsquo; of the form of some English vocabulary .\n\n\nMoreover ,  \" printing made words more mobile , ......\n( they ) travelled at speed across continents in books .\n\"  ( Hughes , 1988 , 29 )\n\n\nAlthough it did not have a major impact in creating or introducing\nnew words , it did a great job in the spreading of English vocabulary of\nhigher uniformity . \n \n\nThe rapid development of technology and new sciences in recent\ncenturies have resulted in the introduction of many technological terms .\n\n\nSome of them are of Latin or Greek origin .\n\n\nOthers are the result of combination with Germanic .\n\n\nThese words include \"  bacteriology  \" ,\n \" microscope \"  ,  \" radioactive\n\"  ,  \" semiconductor \"  , \n\" software \"  ,  \" television \"\n , etc . ( Allen , 1990 , xvi ) \n \n\nOf course , there are many other English vocabulary which are\nborrowed from other countries in the historical development of the English\nlanguage .\n\n\nFor example ,  \" apartheid \"  (\nAfrikaans ) ,  \" amok \"  ( Malay\n) ,  \" czar \"  ( Russian ) ,\n\"  igloo  \" ( Eskimo ) , \n\" Ketchup \"  ,  \" sampan \" \n( Chinese ) , etc . ( Crystal , 1990 , 38 )\n\n\nThese loanwords may be resulted from the historical interaction of\nsome kinds between two cultures at a time .\n\n\nThese will not be examined here because it is far more important to\nunderstand the main theme than to know the details here . \n \n\nThe section above has dealt with the proposition that events and\neras with specific historical context can be acted as the explainer of the\nconstituent vocabulary of the English language .\n\n\nIt seems that we can judge whether or not a word is a member of the\nEnglish language .\n\n\nHowever , one should not be misled by the example given because\nthose examples reveal only the fact that they are still being used today .\n\n\nThere are a lot more example of words which are totally unfamiliar\nto us .\n\n\nFor example , Old English words such as  \" bl an\n\"  ,  \" caf \"  ,  \" dugu\n\"  , \"  f twa  \" ..... have not\nsurvived at all . ( Pyles and Algeo . 1982 , 110 )\n\n\nBy citing only a few example here can one argue that we cannot\nsimply explain what the words of a language are just by saying how they got\ninto the language ( that is , from the historical point of view\n) .\n\n\nThere must be some other criteria which may be necessary to\ndetermine whether or not a word is a member of the English language . \n \n\nIn the beginning of this essay , I have mentioned that there is\nno definite circumference of the English language in terms of vocabulary\n( both number and aspects concerned ) .\n\n\nHowever , there is yet another frontier &longdash; time .\n\n\nAs Murray ( 1888 , 61 ) says :  the language\npresents yet another undefined frontier , when it is viewed in relation to\ntime ....... \n\n\nIt is not to-day what it was a century ago , still less what it\nwill be a century hence .......\n\n\n&lsquo; Old words &rsquo; are ever becoming obsolete and dying out\n: &lsquo; new words &rsquo; are continually pressing in .\n\n\nAnd the death of a word is not an event of which the date can be\nreadily determined .\n\n\nIt is a vanishing process ......    (\nMurray , 1888 , 61 )  \n \n\nAnd now we may agree Murray  ' s point that it is not the date\nwhich determines the death of a word .\n\n\nRather , it is a vanishing process .\n\n\nWhich thing actually governs the vanishing process ?\n\n\nAnd , more precisely , which words should be included in a\ndictionary ? \n \n\nIt is obviously impossible to include all the English words\n( including those emerged in Old English period , Middle English\nperiod and Modern English period ) in a dictionary &longdash; and it\nmay not be practical in doing so in at least two ways : first , to involve\nall the possible English words may create a set of dictionaries containing\nprobably more than a hundred volumes .\n\n\n( But , this may still be a minor problem . ) Second ,\nto include all English words into a dictionary may lead to problems in the\npresentation system of a dictionary .\n\n\nFor example , as it has been mentioned before , Old English words\nare highly inflected but Modern English words are not .\n\n\nThis leads to difficulty in the treatment of words of different\nperiods .\n\n\nOf course , a third point may be added because there are few people\nin the world that would frequently consult words of Old English origin .\n\n\nSo , it is not very surprising when Murray ( 1888 , 61\n) says ,  \" practical utility has some bounds , and a\nDictionary has definite limits . \"  \n \n\nIt becomes very clear that we are turning from English\nvocabulary in its historical context to English vocabulary viewed\nlinguistically within an existing system of explanation .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "5a2dc414-7ca6-4eb6-9f89-0178ea5a3216", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.878527+00:00"}

activities .\n\n\nHe was set free after serving a 10-year jail term . \n\n \n\nAfter the 4 June crackdown , key dissents including Wang Dan ,\nChen Ziming and Wang Juntao were charged with the same offence and sent to\njail . \n\n \n\nThe debate on the need to redefine the \"\ncount-revolutionary &rdquo; charge is likely to continue for the next two\nyears or so although some Chinese officials and academics have long felt the\nneed to replace the vague term with a more explicit legal concept . \n\n \n\nIn 1988 , the Law Committee of the Standing Committee of the\nNational People  ' s Congress ( NPC ) drafted amendments for the\nrelevant provisions .\n\n\nDiscussions continued during the NPC annual session in March 1989 ,\nonly a few weeks before the outbreak of the pro-democracy movement in China .\n\n\n \n\nAt the NPC session , Hongkong and Macau deputies were briefed on\nthe issue . \n\n \n\nThey were told that Beijing authorities were considering a change\nin the legal system which could make Chinese people less vulnerable to\nideological accusations . \n\n \n\nUnder the proposal , counter-revolutionary offences would be\ndefined as subversion , making it less likely for people to be prosecuted for\ncriticizing authorities . \n\n \n\nJiang Ping , vice-chairman of the Law Committee , told the\nHongkong deputies on 30 March , 1989 , that people could be accused of the\nnarrower crime of \" endangering the state security &rdquo; . \n\n \n\nThe new proposal would more clearly defines offences covered by\ncounter-revolutionary charges , which would comprise any acts aimed at\n\" overthrowing the proletariat dictatorship government , the socialist\nsystem and jeopardizing the People  ' s Republic &rdquo; . \n\n \n\nUnfortunately , however , the proposal was shelved following the\noutbreak of the student movement in the spring of 1989 , which ended in the\nTiananmen Square crackdown by the People  ' s Liberation Army on 3-4 June .\n\n\n \n\nIn the aftermath of the crackdown , a number of students leaders\nand intellectuals were either arrested or placed on the wanted list for\n\" counter-revolutionary &rdquo; activities during the pro-democracy\nmovement . \n\n \n\nThe question of the \" amendment &rdquo; was brought up for\ndiscussion once again in an official newspaper in March , 1991 . \n\n \n\nThe  Legal Daily  said China might abolish the\ncontroversial political crime of \" counter-revolutionary &rdquo; . \n\n \n\nThe paper said China  ' s vaguely defined political crime should be\nreplaced by the internationally recognized charged of sedition . \n\n \n\nThe offence , if not amended , could cast a shadow over the\nfuture relationship between Hongkong and the mainland under the \" one\ncountry , two systems &rdquo; policy . \n\n \n\nDuring the drafting of the Basic Law between 1985 and 1990 ,\nlocal concern was voiced over the applicability of the offence to the\nHongkong Special Administrative Region . \n\n \n\nEventually , the concept of the \" counter-revolutionary\n&rdquo; offence was enshrined in the Basic Law but differently . \n\n \n\nDebate on how the Basic Law article should be translated into the\nHongkong ordinance infer the Common Law jurisdiction is expected to spark\nfresh conflict in the territory .  \n\n \n\n\n Policies expected to eliminate the economic imbalance \n \n\n\n By STANLEY LEUNG  \n\n \n\nCHINA is adopting a \" comprehensive &rdquo; opening policy\nthat will not only attract more overseas investment but give a better chance\nfor various regions to develop . \n\n \n\nUnder the new policy , areas along the coast ( east\n) , rivers ( central ) and border ( southeast ,\nnortheast and northeast ) will all be opened to other countries . \n\n \n\nOpening of more cities and regions will have a significant impact\non China  ' s macroeconomic development in the coming decade . \n\n \n\nSince the introduction of reform policy in 1979 , China favoured\nthe Special Economic Zones ( SEZs ) , all in Guangdong and\nFujian provinces , Hainan , and the 14 coastal cities by granting them\npreferential treatment . \n\n \n\nAt one stage , former party chief Zhao Ziyang promoted his\nstrategy of turning the coastal regions into China  ' s economic center ,\nleaving the inland provinces poor . \n\n \n\nUnder his plan of \" international great cycle &rdquo; ,\nproduction should rely heavily on overseas markets .\n\n\nBut the plan which further widened the gap between coastal and inland\nprovinces met with strong resistance and was eventually dropped . \n\n \n\nThe opening of the border areas in such provinces as Guangxi ,\nYunnan , Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang strikes a balance in the traditional\npolicy which heavily relied on the opening of coastal regions in the eastern\nareas , notably Guangdong and Fujian . \n\n \n\nThe fast economic growth of coastal regions in the past decade\nfurther widened the gap of development with that of the inland provinces as\nshown by differences in income and foreign investment . \n\n \n\nThe opening of border and central river areas could help correct\nthe imbalance . \n\n \n\nWith a long land borderline , China  ' s neighbouring countries\ninclude Korea , Mongolia , Afghanistan , Pakistan , India , Nepal , Burma ,\nLaos , Vietnam , Russia and three Commonwealth of Independent States\ncountries . \n\n \n\nA number of inland and border regions have recently been opened\nto foreign investment .\n\n\nThey include Pingxiang city and Dongxing country in Guangxi province\n, Heihe in Heilongjiang province and Manzhouli city , Tacheng , Bole ,\nYinging in Inner Mongolia . \n\n \n\nAccording to the central decision on opening the Yangtze River ,\nthe government will grant preferential policies to 28 cities and eight\nprefectures to develop a cast area stretching westward from Shanghai at the\nriver  ' s month to Chongqing in the southwest .  \n\n \n\n\n Crackdown on prostitution   \n\n\n By STANLEY LEUNG  \n\n \n\nTHE Guangdong authorities have arrested 868 pimps and organizers\nof brothels and 13,500 prostitutes and their customers in the past three\nmonths . \n\n \n\nThe figures were revealed by a Guangdong party official in charge\nof law and order , Fang Bao , according to the semi-official Hongkong China\nNews Agency ( HKCNA ) . \n\n \n\nMr Fang said of the 13,500 arrests , there were 6,200 prostitutes\nand 6,480 customers .\n\n\nCases involving 7,000 people had been handled with most of them being\nsent for re-education . \n\n \n\nAlthough spread of the problem in the province has been\ncontrolled , he said there was no room for complacency . \n\n \n\nThe HKNCA report said provincial party authorities and government\nhad made concerted efforts from April to June to crack down on prostitution\nand tidy up public places . \n\n \n\nDuring the period , 5,650 vice dens including hostels ,\nhair-dressing parlours , beauty salons , dancing halls and karaoke clubs were\ninvestigated and streamlined .\n\n\nAbout 1,400 were closed with 338 licences suspended . \n\n \n\nHidden rooms in 4,058 hair-dressing parlours were pulled down\nwith 3,300 massage beds confiscated .\n\n\nMore than 3,000 massage girls were dismissed . \n\n \n\nMany companies have improved their management system and signed\ncontracts with public security authorities to fight crime . \n\n \n\nTo cope with the anti-prostitution campaign , 63 rehabilitation\nand detention centers were built throughout the province to accommodate the\nprostitutes and customers . \n\n \n\nThis year , authorities in the province allowed and encouraged\npolice to raid ant place they suspected of being a brothel inside and outside\ntheir own jurisdictions .  \n\n \n\n\n Xinhua man tipped to assume Guangdong post   \n\n\n By STANLEY LEUNG  \n\n \n\nADEPUTY director of Xinhua News Agency , Zheng Hua , is expected\nto take up an advisory post in Guangdong in the next two months , according\nto a Chinese source . \n\n \n\nMr Zheng , 62 , will be appointed vice-chairman of Guangdong\nPeople  ' s Political Consultative Conference , the source said . \n\n \n\nThere has been speculation in the past two years on the departure\nof Mr Zheng , the No 2 man in the Hongkong branch of Xinhua . \n\n \n\nSince his posting to Hongkong from Macau in 1984 , he has been in\ncharge of the united front and organisational work . \n\n \n\nIt is understood Mr Zheng , who is an alternate number of the\nparty  ' s Central Committee and a delegate to the 13th party congress in late\n1987 , would retire from Xinhua before the 14th party congress scheduled for\nthe end of this year . \n\n \n\nXinhua  ' s propaganda head , Sun Nansheng , said he had no idea of\nMr Zheng  ' s transfer . \n\n \n\nMr Sun described as \" subjective speculation without\ngrounds &rdquo; reports on the possible replacement of director Zhou Nan by\nShenzhen party chief Li Hao . \n\n \n\nMr Zhou was in Beijing on business after attending the National\nPeople  ' s Congress standing committee meeting . \n\n \n\nIt had been reported that Mr Zhou had been in poor health soon\nafter taking up the post . \n\n \n\nAnother deputy director of Xinhua , Zhang Junsheng , said Mr Zhou  ' s\nimminent replacement was groundless speculation . \n\n \n\nHe said Mr Zhou was feeling unwell last month and rushed to\nBeijing for meetings soon after returning to Hongkong from Shenzhen . \n\n\n \n\n\n Jailing shows political reform is not on agenda  \n\n\n\n By STANLEY LEUNG  \n\n \n\nTHE United States , as expected , has condemned China for holding\na closed trial of former senior party official Bao Tong . \n\n \n\nA US State Department spokesman condemned Chinese authorities on\nTuesday for refusing to open the trial to Mr Bao  ' s family and outside\nobservers and expressed regret that China \" persists in considering\npeaceful expression of political views to be &lsquo; counter-revolutionary\nincitement &rsquo; deserving of imprisonment &rdquo; . \n\n \n\nThe US appears to be the only country which has spoken out over\nMr Bao  ' s trial . \n\n \n\nIn the last three years , Western countries have put pressure on\nBeijing over the jailing of prominent student leaders and intellectuals\nincluding Wang Dan , Wang Juntao , Chen Ziming and Bao Zunxin .\n\n\nBut Mr Bao Tong  ' s case was seldom mentioned before he was tried .\n\n\n \n\nCommenting on the sentencing of Mr Bao , Robin Munro , a\nresearcher with a New York-based human rights organisation Asia Watch , said\n: \" The message is clear : there will be no political reform. &rdquo;\n\n\n \n\n\" The kind of political reform that people like Bao Tong\nstand for -; essentially liberalisation and pluralism -; is to be\navoided like the plague . \n\n \n\n\" ( Senior leader ) Deng Xiaoping would have\nwanted to give people that message , especially now since he is stepping up\nthe pace of economic change. &rdquo; \n\n \n\nIn the last few months , the US has repeatedly urged Beijing to\nallow international observers to attend the trial . \n\n \n\nOn 7 July , the US State Department said : \" We are\nconcerned that Mr Bao receives a fair trial, &rdquo; and that the US would\ncontinue to press Beijing to permit international observers . \n\n \n\nIt is unlikely China would bow to such international pressure on\nwhat it regards is a domestic affair . \n\n \n\nOn 9 July , China ruled out the possibility of letting foreign\nobservers attend the trial .\n\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin quoted Chinese judicial\nstatutes as saying foreigners would be admitted to trials only in cases\ninvolving foreign nationals or foreign affairs .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "16df3a38-e669-4e49-bbe5-9963bd75f91e", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.880165+00:00"}

{"text": "INTRODUCTION \n\n\n Pillar  and tie-beam are the core part of the\nChinese wooden structure .\n\n\nThe fundamental elements of the timber-frame structure are pillar ,\ntie-beam , purloin  and tou-kung  .\n\n\nThe load of the roof passes through the purlins , tie-beams , pillars\nand then finally to the platform .\n\n\nso the wall which are built with bricks are not designed to carry any\nloading and their function is limited to partitioning the rooms .\n\n\nHence , for Chinese timber-frame structure , there is the common\nsaying that the  \" even when the walls fall down , the house\nwill not collapse &rdquo;  . \n\n\n This osseous construction permits complete freedom in walling and\nfenestration and , by the simple adjustment of the proportion between walls\nand openings , renders a house practical and comfortable in any climate from\nthat of tropical Indochina to that of subarctic Manchuria .\n\n\nDue to its extreme flexibility and adaptability , this method of\nconstruction could be employed wherever Chinese civilization spread and would\neffectively shelter occupants from the elements . \n\n\n The Two Structural Systems \n\n\n Between the first and second century , the development of the wooden\nstructure is formalized .\n\n\nThere is two main categories : One is \" Pillar-and-beam &rdquo;\nstructure  , another is \"\nPillar-and-traverse-tie-beam &rdquo; structure  .\n\n\nThis structure adopts without any great change in the principle until\nthe nineteenth century . \n\n\n The \" Pillar-and-beam &rdquo; structure \n\n\n The main principle is erecting pillars on the raised platform , putting\ntie-beam  on the pillars , placing short pillars\n on the tie-beams , and then you find short\ntie-beam  is resting on the short pillars , the\nshort pillars are putting on the short tie-beams again , and then so on until\nit reaches the ridge purlin  .\n\n\nMoreover , the ends of the tie-beam are joined by the purlin  .\n\n\nSo that the \" Pillars-and-beam &rdquo; structure is formed .\n\n\n\n The size and form of the structure are related to the width and property\nof the building .\n\n\nFor small width , we can only use two pillars .\n\n\nHowever , for large width , we must use three or more pillars to\nsupport the tie-beams above .\n\n\nWe user the number of purlin as a standard to represent the scale of\nthe structure .\n\n\nIt is because the distance between purlins \nis nearly constant , about two metres , in every building .\n\n\nSo that a large purlin number represents a giant building . \n\n\n The \" Pillar-and-traverse-tie-beam &rdquo; structure \n\n\n The main elements are pillar  ,  chuen\nfong   ,  dao fong   ,  hin chi  \nand purlin  .\n\n\nThe load from the roof passes through the rafter  to the pillars , and then from purlins to the pillars .\n\n\nThe  chuen fong  are not load bearing , it only use as\na horizontal connector of the pillars . \n\n\n There are much more pillars and traverse-tie-beam in the \"\nPillar-and-traverse-tie-beam &rdquo; structure .\n\n\nSo the diameter of the pillar is quite small ( 20-30cm\n) .\n\n\nAnd the size of the  chuen fong  is much smaller than\nthe pillar .\n\n\n( Height : 10-20cm . Width : 5-10cm ) \n\n\n The size of the structure is determined by the number of  chuen\nfong  .\n\n\nThere are several types of forms , such as \nand  .\n\n\nSome pillars will not go down to the platform , instead , they just\nrest on the  chuen fong  .\n\n\nSo that the internal space can be enlarge .\n\n\nHowever , in this case , the size of  chuen fong  must\nbe increased so as to bear the load from the shorten pillars . \n\n\n Come to a nut shell , \" pillar-and-traverse-tie-beam &rdquo;\nstructure is a simple timber-frame structure .\n\n\nIt will not use in the giant building , such as the palace .\n\n\nHowever , it is very common in the dwelling unit in the southern part\nof China .\n\n\n\n\n  Bracket Set (  tou-kung  )\n \n\n\n A set  of tou-kung   , or\nbrackets , is an assemblage of a number of  tou   ( blocks ) and  kung   ( arms ) .\n\n\nThe function of the set is to transfer the load from the horizontal\nmember above the vertical member below .\n\n\nA set may be placed either on the column , or on the architrave\nbetween two columns , or on the corner column , Accordingly , a set of\n tou-kung  may be called a \" column set &rdquo; ,\n\" intermediate set &rdquo; , or \" corner set &rdquo; depending on\nthe position it occupies . \n\n\n The members that make up a set may be divided into three main categories\n:  tou  ,  kung  and  ang   .\n\n\nThere are four kinds of  tou  and five kinds of\n kung  , determined by their functions and positions .\n\n\nBut structurally the most important members of a set are the \nlu-tou   or major bearing block , and the\n hua-kung   , to both front and rear\n, at right angles to the facade of the building . \n\n\n Sometimes a slanting member , at approximately a 30&degree; angle to the\nground , is placed above the  hua-kung  &semi;\n\n\nit is called the  ang  .\n\n\nThe \" tail &rdquo; or upper end of   the \n ang  is often held down by the weight of the beam or the\npurlin , making it a lever arm for the support of the large overhang of the\neave . \n\n\n The  hua-kung  may be used in successive tiers , each\nextending front and rear a certain distance beyond the tier below .\n\n\nSuch a tier and extension is called a  t'iao   or \" jump &rdquo; , and the number of \ntiao  in a set may vary from one to five .\n\n\nTransverse  kung  interest the  hua-kung\n in the  lu-tou  .\n\n\nOne or two tiers of tranverse kung may be used in a  t'iao\n .\n\n\nSuch an arrangement is known as  chi-hsin   , or \" accounted heart &rdquo; , while a \ntiao  without transverse kung is known as  t'ou-hsin \n , or \" stolen heart &rdquo; .\n\n\nOne tier of transverse  kung  is called \ntan-kung   , or single  kung\n &semi;\n\n\na double tier is call  ch'ung-kung   , or double  kung  .  \n\n\n  Development of the Timber Frame Structure  \n\n\n The earliest source that reveals he appeareance of a timber-frame\nbuilding is the relief on a bronze vase of the period of the Warring States\n( 403-221 B.C. ) of the Chou Dynasty .\n\n\nIt show on a platform a two-storied building with columns , eaved\nroofs , doors and railings .\n\n\nParticularly significant are the indications of columns with the\ncharacteristic bracket sets . \n\n\n Timber-frame structure may be tentatively divided into three main periods\n: the Period of Vigor , the Period of Elegance and the Period of rigidity .\n\n\n\n The Period of Vigor \n\n\n It includes the phase from the middle of the ninth century to the middle\nof eleventh century , or from the reign of Emperor Hsuan-tsung of Emperor\nJen-tsung of the Sung dynasty .\n\n\nThis period is characterized by a robustness of proportion and\nconstruction .\n\n\nIt shows for the first time the brackets with outstretching arms , or\nhua-kung , uses as cantilevers to support the great overhang of the eave .\n\n\nThe two tiers of jutting  hau-kung  are intersected by\ntransverse  kung  , and the inverted-V intermediate set is\nalso used .\n\n\nThe examples can find in the Liao domain in North China . \n\n\n The Period of Elegance \n\n\n It extends from the middle of the eleventh century to the end of the\nfourteenth century or from the reign of Emperor Ying-tsung of the sung\ndynasty , through the Yuan dynasty , to the death of Emperor T'ai-tsu .\n\n\nIt is marked by a gracefulness in proportion and refinement in detail .\n\n\n\n The most noticeable stylistic evolution is the gradual diminution of the\n tou-kung  , which were reduced from generally about one third\nthe height of the column to about one fourth by 1400 .\n\n\nThe intermediate set becomes relatively larger in size and more\ncomplicated in combination .\n\n\nIt further complicates by the introduction of the diagonal \nkung  .\n\n\nThis intermediate set becomes a burden to the architrave .\n\n\nThe  ang  ' s  disposition gives the architect a\nwonderful opportunity to display his ingenuity , resulting in various\ncombination of great interest .\n\n\nMoreover , the sets are always designed to do their share in\nupholding the whole structure and are seldom idle or merely decorative . \n\n\n The Period of Rigidity \n\n\n It lasts from the begining of the fifteenth century or the end of the\nnineteenth century , or from the reign of Emperor Ch'eng-tau of the Ming\ndynasty to the overthrow of the Ch'ing dynasty by the Republic .\n\n\nIt is identified by a general rigidity , a clumsiness of proportion\nresulting from the excessive size of all horizontal members , and the\ndecrease in size of the  tou-kung  , hence the increase in\nnumber of the intermediate sets , which have by this time degenerated from\ntheir original structural function to mere ornaments . \n\n\n Measuring about one-half or one-third the height of the column in the\nSung Dynasty ,  tou-kung  in the Ming Suddenly shrunken to\none-fifth .\n\n\nThe number of intermediate sets increase to seven or eight .\n\n\nThe  ang  with its long tail , has no place in a\ncolumn set with a disproportionately large beam directly on it .\n\n\nThe false  ang  is therefore always employed where the\neffect of  ang  is desired .\n\n\nIn the disposition of beams forming the roof support the \ntou-kung  is dispensed with altogether and the beams rest directly on\ncolumns or struts .\n\n\nThe purlins are supported directly on the ends of the beams , without\nthe assistance of  kung  or the bracing of  Ch'a-Shou\n or  t'o-chiao  .\n\n\nso the  tou-kung  ,   except  in\nthe column sets , is therefore by now pure ornament . \n\n\n Case Study \n\n\n ( 1 ) The Period of Vigor -\n\n\nMain Hall of Fo-kuang Ssu \n\n\n The oldest wooden structure known today is the Main Hall of Fo-kuang Ssu\n, in the Wu-tai Mountains , Shans &semi; Province .\n\n\nIt was built in 857 . \n\n\n It is extremely impressive with its rigorous and robust proportions .\n\n\nThe enormous  ton-kung  of four tiers of cantilevers -\ntwo tiers of  hua-kung  and two tiers of  ang \n- measuring about half the height of the columns with every piece of timber\nin the ensemble doing its share as a structural member , give the building an\noverwhelming dignity that is not found in later structures .\n\n\nThe building  ' s most significant feature , from the point of view of\ndating structural evolution , is the formation of the \" truss &rdquo;\nimmediately under , and therefore supporting , the ridge .\n\n\nOn the top tier of beams are placed a pair of  Cha-shou\n ( \" abutting arms &rdquo; ) butting against each\nother to carry the ridge pole , while the \" king-post &rdquo; is\nmissing altogether .\n\n\nThis is a rare survival of early construction practice . \n\n\n\n\n\n ( 2 ) The Period of Elegance -\n\n\nSheng Mu Miao \n\n\n Sheng Mu Miao locates at Chin-tz'u , near T'aiyuan , Shans &semi;\nProvince .\n\n\nIt consists of a double-eaved Main Hall , Front Hall and a \np'ai-lou  .\n\n\nThe two halls were built in the T'ien-sheng period (\n1023-1031 ) \n\n\n A prominent characteristic of the  tou-kung  of the\nChiu-tz'u group is the shape of the beak of the  ang  .\n\n\nIn earlier buildings , the beak is a simple bevel , rectangular in\ncross section .\n\n\nBut later , the beveled portion is scooped and pulvinated ,\nresulting in a cross section with a rounded top .\n\n\nAnd other feature of the  tou-kung  is the false   ang  .\n\n\nHere the  hua-kung  is shaped on the outer end into a\nbeak like that of an  ang  .\n\n\nThus the decorative effect of the   beak  is\nobtained without using the slanting member itself .\n\n\nThe  hua-kung  becomes merely an \" applied\nornament &rdquo; , a sign of degeneration . \n\n\n ( 3 ) The Period of Rigidity -\n\n\nThe T'ai-ho Tien ( Hall of Supreme Harmony ) \n\n\n It is the principal audience hall of the palaces and the focal point of\nthe entire Forbidden City .\n\n\nWith its six rows of twelve columns each , forming a hypo style hall\neleven bags in length and five in depth , double-eaved and hip-roofed , it is\nthe largest single premodern building in China . \n\n\n The  tou-kung  of this gigantic hall are extremely small\nin proportion - less than one-sixth of the column height .\n\n\nAs many as eight intermediate sets are used in one bay .\n\n\nFrom a distance the presence of  tou-kung  is hardly\nnoticeable .\n\n\nThe walls , columns , doors and windows are painted vermilion , the\n tou-kung  and architraves are blue and green accented with\ngold .  \n\n\n\n\n  INTRODUCTION  \n\n\n The wedding vow :  \" For better or worse . . . . . . Till\ndeath will we depart &rdquo;  seems to be a faded motto in our\ncontemporary society .\n\n\nNowadays , the ideology of the \" casual relationship &rdquo;\nhas become popular not only among the youth , but also gradually among the\ngeneral public . \n\n\n The concept such as :  \" Having possessed once is more\ndesirable than staying together eternally &rdquo;  ,  \"\nMarriage is the grave of courtship &rdquo;  , and  \" To\nmarry owing to misunderstanding , and to separate owing to rational\nunderstanding &rdquo;  , has been promoted by the mass media , and\nseems to be adopted by all walks of life .\n\n\nConsequently , divorce is no longer a taboo in Hong Kong . \n\n\n Marriage , as the actualization of genuine love in the form of lasting\nrelationship , has been challenged from time to time .\n\n\nHowever , there exists some people who still uphold the value of\ngenuine love and lasting marriage .\n\n\nThis paper aims to examine the essence of the lasting marital\nrelationship by reviewing the process and characteristics of courtship , as\nwell as the facts and consequences of divorce . \n\n\n  PRESENT SITUATION IN HONG KONG  \n\n\n Being greatly influenced by the western culture , the fad of liberalism\nand pleasure principle has arrived at Hong Kong at the 70's .\n\n\nWith the increased prosperity of the society , the emergence of\nnuclear family , the declination of the traditional norms , and the\npropaganda of the mass media , the form of heterosexual relationship becomes\ndiversified . \n\n\n Pre-marital and ex-marital ships are not uncommon in the society .\n\n\n  Casual  sex not only exists among the\n\" yuppies &rdquo; , but also among the \" marginal &rdquo; and\n\" normal &rdquo; youth .\n\n\nFurthermore , divorce rate has been raised sharply , with\napproximately 5700 cases at 1987 , 5898 cases in 1988 , and definitely more\nat the years afterwards .  \n\n\n Even the most traditional sector , the Christian circle has no exception\neither .\n\n\nIncreasing number of cases of marital breakdown has been reported\namong the Christians with the majority of them having married for two or\nthree years only .  \n\n\n With the coming of 1997 , most of the families in Hong Kong are\nexperiencing exceeding stress .\n\n\nThe political and social uncertainty : especially after the \"\n4th of June &rdquo; event &semi; has   exposed  the\nfragility and vulnerability of many marriages .\n\n\nThese , together with the problems aroused by emigration ,\ncontribute significant to the mounting up of the marital hazard and actual\nmarital breakdown . \n\n\n Is it possible for the marriage to survive under stress ?\n\n\nWhat can the marriage contribute to the ups and downs in our life\ncycle ?\n\n\nHow can we establish and maintain a lively and enduring marital\nrelationship ? \n\n\n To answer the above questions , reviewing the process and the\ncharacteristics of courtship and divorce may provide some valuable insights .\n\n\n\n  COURTSHIP - ITS PROCESS AND CHARACTERISTICS  \n\n\n Courtship is the period which follows   casual \ndating and precedes engagement and marriage . \n\n\nIt is the process through which the couples know each other and\ninvestigate the possibility of going further till marriage . \n\n\n The courtship starts at   casual  relationship in\ngroup or in double dating .\n\n\nThe process then moves on to more serious stage of involvement ,\nsuch as dating steadily .\n\n\nIf possible it will end at engagement and marriage . \n\n\nHowever , termination of the relationship may also occur in any\nstage during the process . \n\n\n According to Levinger ( 1980 ) , interpersonal relationship\nnormally undergo five possible stages : initial attraction building a\nrelationship , continuation ,   deterioriation  ,\nand ending .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c43eaada-8c49-42d0-9aca-394f59525c51", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.882724+00:00"}
{"text": "Always look on the dark side of life  \n\n\n  Alex Lo  \n\n\n  BY NOW , MOST  people know who John Nash is , even if they\nknow nothing about his obscure mathematical \" game theory &rdquo; . \n\n\n  New York Times  reporter Sylvia Nasar  ' s best-selling 1998\nbiography of the mathematical genius ,  A Beautiful Mind  , and the\nnew blockbuster film of the same name , are threatening to do to game theory\nwhat Albert Einstein did to physics and Bertrand Russell to mathematical\nlogic - make it look almost sexy . \n\n\n The film came in second in the Hong Kong box office last week and the\nbook has been on bookstore chain Page One  ' s bestseller list for weeks . \n\n\n Game theory studies strategies available to competing or partially\nco-operating players to predict possible outcomes from available options .\n\n\nEconomists , political scientists and government planners are among\nits most frequent users . \n\n\n Cheng Shiu-yuen , a mathematics professor and associate dean of science\nat the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology , says he has started\nteaching Nash  ' s Nobel Prize-winning paper in his undergraduate class now\nstudents seem to have taken a new interest in the man .\n\n\n\" All 28 lines of proof - it  ' s a very short paper , &rdquo;\nsays Professor Cheng , also a specialist in the theory . \n\n\n Nash , who was diagnosed with schizophrenia after a mental collapse at\nthe age of 30 but recovered in the early 1990s , has found himself embroiled\nin a smear campaign after the film was nominated for eight Oscars . \n\n\n Nasar had to write to the  Los Angeles Times  this month\nrepudiating claims Nash was gay , an anti-Semite and a bad father .\n\n\nTo counter the rumours , Nash and his long-suffering wife Alicia\nagreed to be interviewed on 60 Minutes , to be aired on ATV World at 10pm on\nThursday .\n\n\nIn the 1950s , Nash published a series of papers which helped lay a\nfirmer foundation for game theory by covering games with counterparts more\ncommonly found in the real world than those considered by early theorists .\n\n\n\n So Nash examines non-zero sum games , when the rewards or payoffs of a\ngame do not add up to zero - which is when one side takes all and the other\nloses all .\n\n\nIn real life , players rarely lose or gain everything , and there is\na level of co-operation or at least tacit understanding and mutual\nexpectations even among bitter rivals . \n\n\n In what is now called the Nash Equilibrium , the mathematician proves\nthat in every game there is a set of strategies , one for each competing\nplayer , which yields an outcome such that no player can improve his or her\nsituation by unilaterally switching to another strategy . \n\n\n Professor Cheng said not all was positive about the film , which\nemphasised the madness rather than the mathematics , reinforcing a popular\nimage of scientists being madmen . \n\n\n Nash was not the first game theorist to make it into a major Hollywood\nfilm . \n\n\n John von Neumann , one of the theory  ' s founders who advocated the US\nlaunch pre-emptive nuclear strikes against the Russians , served as the\nreal-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick  ' s classic satire\n Dr Strangelove  . \n\n\n Both mathematicians might have been brilliant but they were not the\nnicest of men , which may raise questions about the theory  ' s effects on\nyoung minds . \n\n\n Richard Feynman , the late US physicist , once revealed a dark side of\nthe theory:  &rdquo; Von Neumann gave me a very interesting idea: that you don't\nhave to be responsible for the world that you  ' re in .\n\n\nSo I have developed a very powerful sense of social irresponsibility\nas a result .. .\n\n\nIt  ' s made me a very happy man ever since . &rdquo; \n\n\n He was referring to a game-theoretic situation called \"\nfree-rider &rdquo; , which says if you can evade taxes but enjoy social benefits , or\navoid military draft and let others fight in your place , then you should do\nso . \n\n\n Game theory proves the moralistic secondary school teacher wrong: there\nare always enough diligent taxpayers and soldiers to sustain the game . \n\n\n\n\n  Alex Lo is the Post  ' s science correspondent alexlo@scmp.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Queen  ' s English or anyone  ' s - simply be consistent\n \n\n\n  LIKE ITS COLONIAL  predecessor , the post-handover\nGovernment has , for the most part , adhered to the British form of English .\n\n\nBut the American influence on SAR bureaucracy-speak is becoming\nincreasingly visible .\n\n\nThe current crisis in Afghanistan has provided some evidence . \n\n\n On October 12 , the United Nations Sanctions (  Afghanistan ) (  Arms\nEmbargoes ) Regulation was gazetted .\n\n\nAn official press release explained that the move was meant to freeze\nthe financial assets of \" Usama &rdquo; bin Laden and any person\nconnected with him . \n\n\n Most government agencies elsewhere , including the Chinese and British\nforeign ministries , have referred to the leader of al-Qaeda as \" Osama\n&rdquo; in English .\n\n\nSo have the Saudi Arabian authorities .\n\n\nAmerica  ' s FBI is the only notable exception .\n\n\nThe name \" Usama bin Laden &rdquo; is used on the FBI  ' s list\nof most wanted terrorists . \n\n\n The media statement also referred to territories of Afghanistan under\n\" Taliban &rdquo; control - again an American version of the word .\n\n\nOur two Hong Kong daily newspapers published in English have both\nfollowed the British style in calling the regime \" Taleban &rdquo; . \n\n\n Article 9 of the Basic Law stipulates: \" In addition to the Chinese\nlanguage , English may also be used as an official language by the executive\nauthorities , legislature and Judiciary of the HKSAR . &rdquo; The\nmini-constitution does not specify which brand of English .\n\n\nIt is only a matter of convention that the administration has\npreferred \" British English &rdquo; .\n\n\nAfter all , students are still being told to avoid  &rdquo; Americanisms &rdquo; ,\nat least for examination purposes , despite the fact that the spell-check\nfunctions of their word processors are mostly based on the American\nvocabulary . \n\n\n Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa was meticulous in adopting British spelling\nin his recent Policy Address .\n\n\nHence , there were \" subsidised &rdquo; schools , Family\nService \" Centres &rdquo; and a \" labour &rdquo; market . \n\n\n The term \" favourable &rdquo; was used six times in his script .\n\n\nYet , when the Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority\nreleased its survey findings two months ago , it said comedy was the most\n\" favorable &rdquo; movie genre . \n\n\n Mr Tung also dwelled on the \" globalisation &rdquo; trend .\n\n\nWhen Secretary for Financial Services Stephen Ip Shu-kwan elaborated\non last year  ' s Policy Address , his text pointed to the challenge presented\nby increasing \" globalization &rdquo; .\n\n\nIn a law seminar , Secretary for Justice Elsie Leung Oi-sie also\nmentioned \" economic globalization &rdquo; . \n\n\n Other examples abound .\n\n\nEven on sensitive topics like terrorism , officials have not quite\nmade up their minds as far as their choice of words is concerned .\n\n\nA government statement on October 17 referred to the \" Taleban\n&rdquo; regime , deviating from the use of \" Taliban &rdquo; in the\nrelease issued five days earlier on the sanction regulation . \n\n\n No one in the bureaucracy cares much to standardise the official usage .\n\n\nEven speech writers and information officers are unsure as to whether\nthere is a style book somewhere in their libraries . \n\n\n It is incorrect to suggest that one variation of a language is superior\nto another .\n\n\nIn terms of simplicity and spread however , the American version of\nEnglish definitely has its merits over its British cousin . \n\n\n It would be unrealistic to expect the authorities to make a major effort\nto switch over to \" American English &rdquo; in the foreseeable future .\n\n\nBut the least authorities can do in the meantime is ensure the civil\nservice  ' s use of English is consistent .\n\n\nThe linguistic environment of the SAR is confusing enough - a little\nuniformity on the part of the administration won't hurt . \n\n\n\n \n \n\nPerformance grading threatens quality  \n\n\n The Education Department has engaged experts from Australia to measure\nthe performance of secondary schools and there is controversy as to whether\nthe results should go public . \n\n\n There is nothing wrong with measuring student ability and comparing\nschools .\n\n\nWhat  ' s wrong is to put this in an anti-professional framework where\nthe profession must succumb to top-down or outside pressure .\n\n\nIt will be reduced to unthinking operatives of top officials or\nmanagers if the government keeps on imposing measurements from above . \n\n\n If such measurements are in any way linked to intake competition , as\nthey will when the results go public , education will go down the drain .\n\n\nFor \" prestige &rdquo; , schools will drill the students on how to lie\nin questionnaires on self-esteem .\n\n\nThey will also reduce school life to the little that is measured .\n\n\n\n When intake competition is encouraged , schools will give up their\nprofessional ethics to cater to privileged parents ' anti-education demands .\n\n\nThey will teach in English students who cannot understand one English\nsentence .\n\n\nThey will further refuse entry of \" bad &rdquo; children who\nneed their education most . \n\n\n A study by Arizona State University recently found that attempts to\nimprove US public schools by similar high-stake standardised tests are\nfailing .\n\n\nThe stake is an annual bonus for all teachers in the better schools.\n\n\n\n Important aspects of education that are not tested are being neglected .\n\n\nIn order to get higher marks , many schools encourage their\nlow-achievers to drop out just before the tests . \n\n\n Our union has advocated high-stake , but professional and\nnon-standardised , testing to enhance effectiveness of schools .\n\n\nThis would overcome the problems in the US and would not encourage\nintake competition . \n\n\n The key is to let schools form small autonomous \" quality circles\n&rdquo; to compete among themselves , and only among schools within their own\ncircle . \n\n\n Each circle sets up its own rules and testing criteria .\n\n\nSchools scrutinise each other against \" cheating &rdquo; , for example\n, by adjusting the final results for abnormal dropout rates . \n\n\n The government or funding body , instead of judging the schools , simply\nfunds the competition by allotting a sum proportional to the number of\nteachers in a quality circle .\n\n\nIt is up to the teachers in each circle to decide democratically\nthese crucial points in the \" education effectiveness competition\":\n\n\n\n Whether to join the competition . \n\n\n With which schools to form a quality circle . \n\n\n How to measure education effectiveness . \n\n\n How the award money is distributed among the champion and runners-up .\n\n\n\n How the award money is distributed among teachers within a winning school .\n\n\n\n It won't be a do-or-die thing .\n\n\nSchools may choose to opt out of the competition .\n\n\nBut they may be encouraged to join by a policy that exempts competing\nschools from do-or-die centralised measurements or other top-down measures\n .\n\n\n Such an \" education effectiveness competition &rdquo; is dynamic in\nnature - it grows in sophistication .\n\n\nIn the first few years , it may cover only Chinese , English and\nmathematics .\n\n\nIn the second stage , other easily measured criteria , like more\nacademic subjects , athletic skills , and aesthetic sense , should be\nincluded .\n\n\nBy the 10th year or so , all-round education should be measured .\n\n\n\n Our union has worked out guidelines to measure effectiveness as abstract\nas civic education so the pitfall of schools neglecting the more valuable\naspects of education can be avoided .\n\n\nAlthough , in the short run , the objective is to establish a\nframework of autonomous competition among schools through simpler\nmeasurements , all round education is taken care of in stages . \n\n\n The trick is \" non-standardisation &rdquo; of the tests , and\n\" non-interference &rdquo; from the funding body .\n\n\nIn the quality circle system , there need not be uniform standards ,\nand yet the incentive to improve is equally strong .\n\n\nOn the other hand , the funding body need not invent measuring tools\nagreeable to all and covering more and more complicated aspects of education .\n\n\n\n They just have to state general principles like \" one quarter of\nthe bonus will be withdrawn if , by the fifth year , a quality circle fails\nto include measurement of athletic skills as part of the competition\ncriteria &rdquo; .\n\n\nThe schools in the various circles are expected to comply , or just\nkeep to their narrower competition and get less bonus . \n\n\n In Hong Kong , schools compete to attract parents to send their children .\n\n\nIn practice , the popular schools choose the \" better &rdquo;\nstudents , often of higher socio-economic background , and refuse the\n\" worse\" ' ones .\n\n\nThis has dire consequences for education . \n\n\n To counter this unprofessional culture , our scheme keeps intake\ncompetition at arm  ' s length in several ways .\n\n\nFirst , results of school comparison may not be publicly disclosed ,\nif teachers in a quality circle so wish .\n\n\nSecond , school comparison is only within one voluntary quality\ncircle of several schools .\n\n\nWe aim at maximising the schools ' effort to improve from their\npresent standards .\n\n\nLittle can be deduced about a school  ' s standard on a territory-wide\nor even district-wide basis . \n\n\n Third , \" value-added &rdquo; is an intrinsic feature of the our\ncompetition .\n\n\nOnly then can schools with \" bad &rdquo; intake have a fair\nchance .\n\n\nBut then this is nearly guaranteed by the quality circle system ,\nsince few schools will join a circle where the rules are unfair to them .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "9b519191-7535-4d6a-880a-f4dafc215fc6", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.884294+00:00"}

said Wong . \n\n \n\nWong hopes that Kwok can play a key role in the territory  ' s relay\nteams . \n\n \n\nAlthough the HKASA need the approval of the Hong Kong Amateur\nSports Federation and Olympic Committee , Wong said they were originally\nasked to make up an 11-swimmer squad .\n\n\nSo , there is still one more place for Kwok to fill . \n\n \n\nThe current Asian Games squad has seven women and three men :\nMichael Wright , Arthur Li , Mark Kwok Kin-ming , Robyn Lamsam , Katie Lau\nKing-ting , Fenella Ng Garlok , Caroline Ng , Snowie Pang Wan-yiu , Heidi\nWong Hoi-tik and Vivian Lee Ying-shih . \n\n \n\nKwok , a Form Four science student at St Joseph College ,\nrepresented the territory in the World Cup Short Course Championships in\nJanuary .\n\n\nHe swam in the 50 metres , 100 metres and 200 metres backstroke\nevents as well as 400 metres individual medley . \n\n \n\nKwok said he was disappointed when not selected for next month  ' s\nCommonwealth Games in Victoria , Canada .\n\n\nHe was suffering from respiratory problems in April and had a back\ninjury that required physiotherapy . \n\n \n\nBut he said he has full recovered and has returned to normal\ntraining . \n\n \n\n\" I am sure I can be in top form in the Asian Games , if I\nam selected .\n\n\nI am getting in gear now , &rdquo;

Mark\nKwok -; swam at the three-day Hong Kong National Championships at\nAberdeen yesterday . \n\n \n\nHe clocked 16 minutes 48.36 seconds in the men  ' s 1,500 metres\nfreestyle -; much slower than his best time of 16 minutes 25.9 seconds\nrecorded in Las Vegas in May . \n\n \n\nHe said the heat of the Pao Yue Kong Swimming Pool had affected\nhis performance . \n\n \n\n\" I have only been back here for less than two weeks .\n\n\nI need some time to get used to the weather here .\n\n\nI believe the pool in Hiroshima is much better , &rdquo;

north and south -; or District A and District B . \n\n \n\nA VFA official said Weigang would have to fly between Ho Chi Minh\nin the south and Hanoi in the north frequently during the first phase of his\nappointment which ends in September 10 . \n\n \n\nA Vietnamese official said Vietnam would not compete in October  ' s\nAsian Games in Hiroshima , Japan and would instead concentrate on the 18th\nAsian Cup in December , 1995 . \n\n \n\nVietnam made their international return in the World Cup\nqualifying rounds last year where they were grouped with North Korea , Qatar\n, Indonesia and Singapore . \n\n \n\nVietnam finished bottom of the group but the VFA association\nblamed their long absence from the game for their poor showing . \n\n \n\nWeigang , who holds a degree in engineering , gave up his chosen\nprofession after graduating from the coaching course 26 years ago . \n\n \n\nHe had a short spell with FIFA in Zurich , Switzerland and spent\nsome time coaching and teaching in Southeast Asia and Africa . \n\n \n\nThe 58-year-old German has spent 14 years in Asia travelling from\nHanoi to Cambodia and Laos and lived 17 years in Africa . \n\n \n\nHe coached the national teams of Mali , Ghana and Cameroon . \n\n \n\nBut his main claim to fame was coaching the Cameroon national\nyouth team which then included Oman Biyick , Kana Biyick , Stephen Tataw and\nDavid Embe -;

18 teams in both northern and central regions and 16 in the southern\nregion . \n\n \n\nThe top two teams in each region compete in the two-leg ,\nknock-out round together with the team of the host city and the champions of\nthe previous season . \n\n \n\nThe host this season is Quang Nan Danang Club and last season  ' s\nchampions were Cang Saigon , the same team who beat Hong  \nKong  First Division new boys Golden 2-0 last Sunday .  \n\n \n\n\n Chiu sent off as Golden defeated   \n\n\n From JESSIE HUI in Ho Chi Minh City  \n\n \n\nHONG KONG newcomers Golden again fell foul of local referees\nduring their tour of Vietnam yesterday when they were beaten 2-1 by the\ncountry  ' s national team . \n\n \n\nInternational midfielder Chiu Chung-man , playing on loan from\nSouth China this season , received his marching orders after taking a kick at\nan opposition defender at a stage when his team were a goal ahead . \n\n \n\nChiu had been the subject of some controversial tackles by the\nVietnamese but he was considered the offender when the referee gave him a\nyellow card for complaining too loudly about a bad tackle . \n\n \n\nAnd four minutes from half-time the intimidation proved too much\nfor Chiu , who retaliated and was immediately marched . \n\n \n\nThe decision incensed his teammates and there was a minor scuffle\nbetween them and their Vietnamese counterparts . \n\n \n\nThe local fans did not react too kindly to the incident and\npelted Chiu with plastic bottles as he left the pitch . \n\n \n\nDespite the defeat , Golden chairman Simon Wan Chi-lok said he\nconsidered his team had gained a moral victory . \n\n \n\n\" Our players produced a very good performance , &rdquo;\nsaid Wan .\n\n\n\" Shame on the referees . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe game had started well enough for Golden with a goal coming in\nthe 14th minute . \n\n \n\nFormer Rangers right-back Tang Chi-ming sent the ball into the\npenalty area and a Vietnamese defender failed to clear , leaving Scottish\nstriker Lee Bullen with a simple finish . \n\n \n\nGolden return to Hong Kong this evening with right back Tang ,\nleft-back Yau Wo-kan and sweeper Mike Duxbury carrying injuries and stopper\nGlenn Humphries suffering from illness . \n\n \n\nGolden : Kan Shun-cheong &semi;

I  ' m afraid of my own daughter\n, &rdquo; Tsang sobs , burying her silvery head in vein-etched hands . \n\n \n\nTragically , stories such as Tsang  ' s are common in Hong Kong .\n\n\nAlthough abuse of elderly is an ancient pandemic , the SAR has been\nslow to recognise it .\n\n\nOnly in 1999 did the social services acknowledge there was indeed a\nproblem , but they grossly underestimated the numbers of elderly victims .\n\n\n\" The-then social welfare director said there were 97 cases in\nthat year , &rdquo; says Chung Kim-wah , assistant professor at the Hong Kong\nPolytechnic University  ' s Department of Applied Social Sciences , shaking his\nhead in disbelief .\n\n\n\" We now know that this was not the case .\n\n\nWe come across cases of elderly abuse every day . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nLast year , the official figure was increased to 243 .\n\n\nExactly how many there really are , nobody knows .\n\n\nBut Chung insists that what they are seeing is only a fraction of the\nactual cases . \n\n \n\nHe says that in a survey he conducted with the Chinese University\nof Hong Kong in 1999 , 11 percent of respondents aged 60-plus reported having\nencountered some form of maltreatment .\n\n\nMost vulnerable , the survey found , are the sick , the uneducated ,\nthe poor and the women . \n\n \n\nBut Professor Iris Chi , director of the Centre on Ageing at Hong\nKong University is adamant that it cuts across all classes . \n\n \n\n\" Because abuse is a power thing , it does tend to be the\nstrong taking advantage of the weak .\n\n\nBut I  ' ve also discovered that abuse if really no respected of social\nstanding , &rdquo; she says . \n\n \n\nHaven of Hope Christian Service is both a care and attention\ncentre and a nursing home for the elderly .\n\n\nOld folk gather there to socialise , receive medical treatment or\nbend a friendly ear .\n\n\nIn the room where some elderly people are sitting watching TV , or\njust napping , there is a goldfish tank , an exercise machine and comfortable\nchairs .  \n\n \n\nYet despite the cheery setting and placid-faced regulars , some\nof the clients of social worker Marion Hung have stories of debilitating\nabuse to tell . \n\n \n\nSince its hotline was set up in May , Haven has received around\n40 calls , 15 per cent of them telling harrowing tales of emotional and\nphysical abuse , meted out by relatives and care-givers . \n\n \n\n\" Elderly abuse is a serious problem in Hong Kong ,\nalthough many would rather not talk about it , &rdquo; Hung says . \n\n \n\nIronically , it is the romanticised Chinese ideal of filial piety\nthat is making elderly abuse so hard to unearth .\n\n\nChung is adamant in his condemnation of the government  ' s complacency .\n\n\n \n\n\" They always thought that Hong Kong society was so filial\n, &rdquo; he says .\n\n\n\" So we were totally unprepared when this problem surfaced .\n\n\nAnd since we  ' ve not evolved social measures to cope with elderly\nabuse , we can expect family conflict and problems for may years to come .\n&rdquo; \n\n \n\nAs it happens , Hong Kong  ' s ageing population is a ticking bomb .\n\n\nIn 1996 , 14 per cent of the population was aged above 60 , a figure\nestimated to grow to 19 per cent by 2016 .\n\n\nGiven the lack of procedural guidelines for dealing with elderly\nabuse , Chung is not at all optimistic about the situation . \n\n \n\n\" Hong Kong is totally unprepared for its greying citizens\n, &rdquo; he warns . \n\n \n\nThe city  ' s physical infrastructure is also exacerbating the\nproblem .\n\n\nHong Kong just doesn't have enough space for its hemmed-in people to\nco-habit successfully .\n\n\nAnd when overcrowding happens in a family unit , it  ' s often the\nweakest and frailest who get pushed out first .\n\n\nChung cites cases of old men not allowed back home until dinner time;\ngrannies who have to spend entire days on city park benches . \n\n \n\nGrey-haired Mrs Kwok , 76 , goes to the Kwai Chung Elderly\nService Centre three times a week to get away from it all .\n\n\nThis simply-furnished , two-roomed centre may not be much to look at\n, but it at least provides a respite from her family  ' s mean-spirited\ntreatment . \n\n \n\nHer room at home is one half of a stuffy , windowless hovel\nshared with her grandchildren , but it  ' s not her impoverished circumstances\nthat upset her .\n\n\nWhat is so hurtful is her daughter-in-law  ' s deliberate , systematic\ncruelty . \n\n \n\nTears roll down her sunken cheeks as she recounts the sad events\nof her life .\n\n\n\" I cried in front of my son .\n\n\nHe knows what his wife does .\n\n\nBut even he hits me , &rdquo; she says . \n\n \n\nKwok is not allowed to eat with the rest of the family . She\ncooks barely-adequate meals of salt fish in her own room .\n\n\nShe takes only cold showers , even in winter .\n\n\nWhen she last fell and was unable to get up , she went hungry; nobody\nbrought her any food .\n\n\nNobody even acknowledges her presence .\n\n\n\" I raised my kids and my grandchildren .\n\n\nI  ' m really heartbroken that they  ' re doing this to me , &rdquo; she\nsays weeping . \n\n \n\nAbuse has many guises: psychological , physical , neglect ,\nfinancial , sexual - each just as emotionally devastating as the other .\n\n\nIn the SAR , as in many parts of the world , emotional abuse is the\nmost prevalent form .\n\n\nIn the Polytechnic survey , it constituted 18 per cent of\nmaltreatment cases . \n\n \n\n\" It  ' s terrible when that happens because the abuser is\noften someone who  ' s close to (  the victim ) .\n\n\nThey  ' re afraid to talk about it , they don't know who to turn to ,\n&rdquo; Chi says . \n\n \n\nIt  ' s tough enough just being old , so it  ' s not wonder that such\nmaltreatment is often the last blow that pushes the elderly over the edge .\n\n\nAnd sometimes , the effects of abuse are , quite literally , deadly\nin Hong Kong .\n\n\nThe SAR has the second highest rate of elderly suicide in Asia ,\nafter Singapore . Although the aged only form 12 per cent of the population ,\nChi says , their suicide rates stand disproportionately high at 30 per cent .\n\n\n \n\n\" When you are old , you feel useless; you  ' re not\nrespected , you have no worth .\n\n\nBecause you have no financial means you  ' re not an attractive\ndemographics .\n\n\nThis is a problem that  ' s especially pertinent to Hong Kong , &rdquo;\nChung says . \n\n \n\nTry telling that to tiny Mrs To , 89 , who has never attended\nschool .\n\n\nAside from her string of ailments - rheumatism , diabetes , gastritis\n, and various aches and pains - she has spent her whole life scraping by on\n&dollar;20 a day .\n\n\nBy day , she picks up scraps of cardboard from the street .\n\n\nAt night , the frail grandmother sleeps on a tiny kitchen balcony .\n\n\nBut if her life is indeed a living hell , it  ' s because of her\nabusive daughter-in-law . \n\n \n\n\" She frequently shouts:  ' Why aren't you dead yet ?\n\n\nGo and die ' , &rdquo; she says .\n\n\n\" I have no friends or relatives to turn to for help .\n\n\nI cry and cry until I can't see anymore .\n\n\nI feel so very , very helpless . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nIf To is not to become yet another statistic that slips through\nthe net , then decisive measures need to be taken .\n\n\nThe process of drafting definitions and guidelines on elderly abuse\nstarted by Social Welfare only this May may be too little , too late .\n\n\nExperts are calling for an urgent raft of measures .\n\n\nChung , for one , has one long wish list: \n\n \n\n\" More social system checks and balances; a proper\nretirement protection scheme; greater numbers of independent elderly flats;\nacknowledging the role of care-givers; more general public awareness-raising\ncampaigns . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nIf and when this finally happens , women such as Tsang may one\nday go home without cowering in fear . \n\n \n\n For social welfare workers:  Procedural guidelines\non identifying abuse , the mandatoiry reporting of abuse , and a standardised\nreporting method . \n\n \n\n For the public:  A concrete definition that spells\nout the different forms of abuse , and what to do if you come across it .\n\n\n \n\n Legislation:  Because no specific laws exist ,\nChung Kim-wah of Polytechnic University would like to see an anti-elderly\nabuse act , similar to that in the United States . \n\n \n\n Financial assistance:  The Mandatory Provident Fund\n, introduced only last year , only covers the employed elderly . Chung would\nlike to see a comprehensive retirement protection scheme , which safeguards\nboth working and non-working elderly , including homemarkers . \n\n \n\n Housing:  Shelter housing is currently the main\nform of elderly housing for lower income groups . But since facilities are\nshared , and the average waiting time is two to three years , Chung would\nlike to see more independent units for old folks . \n\n \n\n Care-givers:  Since care-giving is often a\nstressful , thankless job , a better support network , in the form of\ncounselling , training and tax exemptions for family members looking after\nelderly relatives , are needed . Currently , only Caritas and Social Welfare\nDepartment offer career support services in Hong Kong . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Cool , bright sparks   \n\n\nIf necessity is the mother of invention , then Hong Kong needs more\npeople like Emmy Lok , Karen Chan and Chu Ka-wai , who cleaned the board at a\ncompetition to come up with the most wanted inventions in the 21st century .\n Karvin Au-yeung  reports \n\n \n\nHeavy school bags floating on thin air .\n\n\n\" Invisible walking sticks &rdquo; for the blind fused with\n Star Wars  technology .

she says .\n\n\n\" I was just looking to improve existing trash bins .\n\n\nI don't really see myself as an inventor . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nHer concept was simple , yet brilliant .\n\n\n\" I wanted to find a way to get rid of the garbage , &rdquo;\nLok says , \" so I designed a bin that absorbs and degrades toxic\nmaterials before rubbish is processed . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nLok  ' s idea is for the trash to be broken down into smaller\nwaste components before it  ' s picked up by garbage trucks .\n\n\nInside the design student;s \" green &rdquo; bin would be a\nchemical cocktail that will consume the toxic materials . \n\n \n\n\" I know how it will work , &rdquo; she says , \" but\nI don't know yet how to put it all together .\n\n\nI need to work with someone who has a background in chemistry .\n\n\nBut it will work . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe judges thought so .\n\n\nThe panel of experts from academia and government-backed\norganisations also singled out Karen Chan Ka-wing  ' s \" floating &rdquo;\nschoolbag blueprint . \n\n \n\n\" I wear a heavy bag every day , &rdquo; says the\n15-year-old .\n\n\n\" It takes me 40 minutes to get to school .\n\n\nThe bag is so heavy it forced me to think about how I could make it\nlighter .\n\n\nThen , out of the blue , it came to me .\n\n\nIt was like a light bulb flashed on inside my head . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nChan decided to turn her schoolbag into a bowl-shaped helium\nballoon with a couple of designer twists .\n\n\nBasically the bag would be made up of helium pockets welded into a\nhalf sphere .\n\n\nInside would be room for books and other school equipment .\n\n\nInstead of wearing it , the bag would float aloft like a balloon .\n\n\n \n\n\" All you would need is a handle to make sure your balloon\nbag didn't float away , &rdquo; she says . \n\n \n\nChan has even worked out the cost of here invention .\n\n\n\" It could be as cheap as &dollar;100 .\n\n\nIt has to be reasonably cheap , because my classmates wouldn't be\nwilling to buy a really expensive bag . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe bottom line is just as important to Chan as the product\nitself .\n\n\nBut then , she admits that being an \" inventor &rdquo; is out\nof step with her character .\n\n\nChan loves playing the piano and enjoys being a member of the Good\nHope school swimming team . \n\n \n\n\" I just thought the helium bag was a cool idea , &rdquo;\nshe says . \n\n \n\n\" Cool &rdquo;

and a couple of his other gadgets .\n\n\n\" I love the  ' invisible walking stick ' because it helps people\n, &rdquo; Chu says .\n\n\n\" I  ' m also thinking about a new version of it .\n\n\nMy idea is for the sensor to be worn on the wrist , like a watch .\n\n\nBut that idea is still at the research stage . &rdquo;

' \n\n \n\n'These - and similar bits of information - were delivered by the\nstill adoring surviving concubines .\n\n\nThere was no doubt the King did speak English , but to what level of\nproficiency , I shall never know .\n\n\nHe was probably fluent because he started off as the  \ncompradore   or Chinese agent of a great British corporation\nwith offices all over the Chinese Mainland and in Hong Kong .\n\n\nI shall never find out if he was a prattling polyglot. \n\n \n\nNot only are paeans sung to his ability , but also to his good\nlooks:  ' He was so handsome in town they called him \" Hong Kong \n lang   (  Hong Kong good-looking  ) \" .  ' \n\n\nI have only seen his photographs .\n\n\nThe photo which shows him at his youngest is one of him giving away\nhis second daughter when he must have been in his forties: a small natty man\n, with long angular face and well-defined features , he had fairly deep-set\neyes and a straight nose , and a generous mouth which in the photograph was\nset in a rather stern line .\n\n\nWas he indeed known as  ' Hong Kong good-looking ' ?\n\n\nThat is something else I shall never know .\n\n\nIn a later photograph , the dark hair had turned grey and sparse; the\nnarrow face had grown narrower still .\n\n\nHe wore spectacles like the Last Emperor , Puyi  ' s or Georgio\nArmani's .\n\n\nPuyi wore them and Georgio Armani designs them .\n\n\nI was told that these spectacles were more often twirled around with\nhis hand than resting on his nose. \n\n \n\nA photograph of Lee Pak Hung a.k.a .'the King ' hangs in our\npantry , beside one of his first wife , his  ' original match ' .\n\n\nThe pictures are black and white - or were .\n\n\nThey are now a yellowish grey .\n\n\nHe looks quite distinguished , sharp eyes peering out from behind the\nPuyi-Armani spectacles .\n\n\nHe is wearing a pale-coloured linen suit with narrow shoulders .\n\n\nHis photo hangs beside that of his  ' big ' wife because my  ' real'\nmother-in-law , the fourth concubine of the King , had given me instructions\nto always allow the lawful-wedded couple to hang side by side .\n\n\n'Big ' Mother-in-law looks younger than her husband in the photograph\n, but not particularly attractive , with an angular face and severe\ncentrally-parted hairstyle .\n\n\nSo the pictures hang there , over thermos bottles and jars of\nMetamusil , boxes of Panadol , half-full containers of vitamin pills and\ntonics and elixirs , Chinese as well as Western .\n\n\nCertainly a comedown for the King and his consort. \n\n \n\nLee Pak Hung was born in 1885 , during the last decades of the\nQing dynasty to a wealthy family in Nanhai .\n\n\nBy the time of his birth , his family had already been wealthy for\ntwo generations .\n\n\nThe founder of the family fortune was Lee Kai Ming , born in 1823 .\n\n\nLee Kai Ming came from a farming family and made his fortune in Siam\n, as Thailand was then called .\n\n\nLee Kai Ming , grandfather of the King , was known by his\ncontemporaries and descendants by the sobriquet ,  ' Strange-eyed Three ' , and\nI have seen a photograph of him , given to me by one of my sisters-in-law .\n\n\nHe was called  ' Strange-eyed Three ' because he was the third child in\nthe family and - more significantly - he had the strange power of being able\nto see the smallest objects .\n\n\nHis eyes were like a pair of microscopes and telescopes .\n\n\nThis would be hard to believe except that he had left behind proof\nof his unusual abilities .\n\n\nHe copied the whole of Confucius  ' s  Analects  on to a\nsmall round fan and the Tang poem ,  ' The Song of the  Pipa \nGirl ' on to a grain of rice .\n\n\nI have seen these family treasures .\n\n\nAn attempt to sell the fan recently through Christie  ' s came to an\nignominious conclusion when it was declared  ' a mere curiosity ' by the\nresident expert. \n\n \n\nFortunately , the King  ' s  ' strange-eyed ' grandfather had other\ntalents .\n\n\nIn a year of famine in his native Nanhai , Lee Kai Ming made his way\nto Annam , the Chinese name for present-day central Vietnam , by boat en\nroute to Bangkok .\n\n\nA storm in the South China Sea caused the boat to sink .\n\n\nFortunately , Strange-eyed and a handful of others managed to\nclamber into a lifeboat .\n\n\nThey were floating in what seemed to the others like an unending\nstretch of turbulent water when Strange-eyed exclaimed ,  ' Land ahoy!'\n\n\nBecause of his gift , he was able to see the land mass of Annam\nwhich was miles away .\n\n\nGuided by Strange-eyed they finally reached land .\n\n\nThe other survivors , some of whom were Annamese , were so grateful\nthat they gave Strange-eyed enough money and provisions for him to make his\nway to Bangkok overland. \n\n \n\nIn those days , there was already a big Chinese population in\nBangkok - nearly half a million - and they were engaged in feverish\ncommercial activity .\n\n\nOnce in Bangkok , he set about looking for suitable work .\n\n\nHe apprenticed himself to a clock and watch repairman , and - again\nthanks to his extraordinary eyesight - he mastered the delicate skills\nrequired by the profession very quickly .\n\n\nIn those days such talent was rare , and word of his dexterity\nspread quickly .\n\n\nHe was soon able to open his own repair shop and to make a very\ncomfortable living .\n\n\nOnce he had saved enough money , he began to ponder how to go into\nbusiness in a big way .\n\n\nLike Jim Thompson over a century later , he saw great potential in\nthe Thai silk industry .\n\n\nHis native Nanhai was a centre for silk production .\n\n\nHe set up a silk factory in Bangkok , then another and another .\n\n\nHe was not only entrepreneurial but also artistic , using his\nconsiderable artistic talent to create new patterns and designs for the silk\nproduced in his factories .\n\n\nLegend has it that when he was just nineteen , Strange-eyed made his\nway to France to study the use of machines in the production of silk .\n\n\nHis eyes served him well in his role as industrial spy .\n\n\nHe saw the blueprints for a new machine on the desk of one of the\nmanagers some forty or so feet away .\n\n\nBecause he was familiar with the process of production and because\nhe had a photographic memory he was able to reproduce the plans when he\nreturned home .\n\n\nHe had machines , powered by steam , made by an engineering shop in\nGuangzhou in his native China , where he also set up factories .\n\n\nWith the new machines he was able to improve the quality and\nquantity of the silk his factories produced .\n\n\nHe was soon employing nearly one thousand workers .\n\n\nI have heard that later on he outbid rival Chinese in an auction for\na royal monopoly of gambling Bangkok .\n\n\nThis set him firmly on the road to fabulous wealth. \n\n \n\nBy the age of thirty , Strange-eyed had brought his growing\nfamily to live in Nanhai , but he retained his business interest in Siam ,\nand these continued to enrich his sons and grandsons .\n\n\nI have been told he had three sons .\n\n\nThe second , Chun Nam , was the King  ' s father , and was born in\n1856 .\n\n\nTo the concubines of the King , he was known as  ' Old Master ' .\n\n\nThey gave little though to what he was called in the macrocosm\noutside .\n\n\nOne concubine claimed with pride ,  ' Ours is a scholar  ' s family.'\n\n\nHer grounds for this allegation ?\n\n\nIn his youth Old Master , lee Chun Nam , had gone to the capital to\ntake the imperial examinations .\n\n\nThese jinshi examinations had for thousands of years been used by\nthe Chinese government to select people for high official positions .\n\n\nHe had studied hard and did  ' very well ' in the examinations .\n\n\nHe was told that he had succeeded in securing a third-tier award ,\nsomething which was highly regarded .\n\n\nBut , according to the story , a corrupt Qing official refused to\nconfer the honour until he had been given &dollar;200 as a bribe .\n\n\nHis father , Strange-eyed , was furious and refused to pay .\n\n\nHe said to his son ,  ' If we have to pay for it the honour is\nworthless .\n\n\nYou will take the examinations again next year .

{"text": "Local Residents of Hong Kong Chinese White Dolphin  \n\n\n\nSamuel Hung   \n\n \n\n N  ot too long ago , when the Hong Kong public heard\nabout the \" Chinese white dolphin\" , they only had the idea that it was the\nmascot for the Hong Kong Handover in 1997 , and at that time some even\nthought that it was merely a cartoon character .\n\n\nThe others may believe that Chinese white dolphins are endemic to Hong\nKong and soon to be extinct , thanks to the incorrect information released by\nsome local media and environmental groups .\n\n\nLuckily , the tide has turned .\n\n\nIn the last few years , through the education and publicity programme\norganized by the Hong Kong government and extensive coverage by local\nnewspapers and media , the Chinese white dolphin has now become the most\ncelebrated creature in Hong Kong .\n\n\nMany members of the public are quite familiar with the knowledge of\nthe dolphins , and some have even participated in the local dolphin-watching\ntours organized by private operators or NGOs to appreciate the beauty of\nChinese white dolphins and their unique pink colour !\n\n\nTo celebrate the second anniversary of  Hong Kong Discovery \n, a special feature of Chinese white dolphins is prepared for our readers to\nlearn more about these unique animals in Hong Kong .\n\n\nIt is our hope that this article can arouse interest of those who care\nabout nature and conserving the marine environment .   \n\n \n\n  Name   - The name \" Chinese white\ndolphin &rdquo; is given by the local people in southern China , and actually\nits official common name is \" Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin &rdquo; and\nits scientific name is \"  Sousa chinensis  . &rdquo;\n\n\nLocal fishermen used to call them \" Mazhu fish &rdquo; ( \nmeaning the fish of the sea goddess ) , while others may call them \"\nblack taboo &rdquo; and \" white taboo . &rdquo; \n\n \n\n  Distribution   - Chinese white dolphins\nare mainly distributed in the western waters of Hong Kong .\n\n\nTheir major habitats include the waters north and west of Lantau\nIsland .\n\n\nIn the summer and autumn , they also occur in waters south of Lantau\nIsland .\n\n\nIn addition , the dolphin population is also distributed throughout\nthe Pearl River Estuary to the west of the Hong Kong border , from\nNeilingding Island in the north to Guishan Island in the south , and\nextending westward to waters near Zuhai and Macau .\n\n\nThere are even sighting records of Chinese white dolphin occurring in\nModao Men and further west .  \n\n \n\n  Abundance   - In Hong Kong waters , the\nabundance of Chinese white dolphins fluctuates among different seasons ,\nranging from 45 dolphins in spring to 152 dolphins in summer .\n\n\nFrom the past seven years of study , number of dolphins have not\ndecreased or increased substantially .\n\n\nThe current abundance estimate of the Pearl River Estuary population\nis about 1,400 animals . \n\n \n\n  Social Structure   - Chinese white\ndolphins usually hang out in groups of 3-5 individuals , and the group size\nranges from a single individual to large group of 23 animals .\n\n\nTheir social structure is quite fluid , which means their association\nwith one another is very momentary , and they change their companions\nfrequently . \n\n \n\n  Body length and weight   - Newborn calves\nof Chinese white dolphins are only 1 metre in length with a weight of 10-20\nkg , whereas fully grown adults can reach up to 2.8 metres and weigh more\nthan 200 kg . \n\n \n\n  Body colour   - Among the many species of\nwhales and dolphins , the Chinese white dolphins along the southern coast of\nChina have the most unique and varied body colouration .\n\n\nThe newborns are dark gray in colour , and as they reach the juvenile\nstage , their body colour starts to change form light gray to grayish pink\nwith spotting all over the body .\n\n\nWhen they get older and older , their gray spots gradually disappear\n, and the adult Chinese white dolphins are pinkish white in colour , with\nlittle or no spotting at all ! \n\n \n\n  Life span   - The oldest Chinese white\ndolphin we aged so far in Hong Kong is 33 years old , but it is believed that\nthis species can live up to 40 years old . \n\n \n\n  Life history   - Summer and autumn are\nthe breeding seasons for the Chinese white dolphins , with summer as their\ncalving peak .\n\n\nTheir gestation period can last up to 11 months , and mothers mostly\ngive birth to one calf .\n\n\nThe dolphin mother needs to nurse its baby for at least a year . \n\n\n \n\n  Diet   - Chinese white dolphins prefer to\nlive in the estuary , and their diet is also composed mainly of estuarine\nfishes , including lionhead , croakers , herring and anchovies . \n\n \n\n  Threats   - In Hong Kong , the dolphins\nhave to face numerous threats , including fishery bycatch , vessel collision\n, water pollution , underwater noise and habitat loss , which may affect\ntheir long-term survival . \n\n \n\n  Legal protection   - There are several\nlaws in place to protect the Chinese white dolphins and other cetacean\nspecies , including the \" Wild Animal Protection Ordinance &rdquo; and\nthe \" Animal and Plants (  Protected Species ) Ordinance . &rdquo;\n\n\nThe dolphins are also benefited by the implementation of the \"\nMarine Park Ordinance &rdquo; and \" Environmental Impact Assessment Ordinance .\n&rdquo;    \n\n\n CWDs (  Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins ) around the world\n  \n\n \n\nChinese white dolphins are also known as Indo-Pacific humpback\ndolphins .\n\n\nTheir name has already implied that they do not only occur in Chinese\nwaters , but also along the coastal waters of the Indian Ocean and western\nPacific Ocean .\n\n\nThey prefer to live in estuarine environments with water depth less\nthan 20 metres .\n\n\nActually how are the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins outside Hong\nKong ?\n\n\nLet me take you to a few places where they commonly occur and explain\nsome of their interesting features .   \n\n \n\n Taiwan  - Three were some unconfirmed reports of\nthe occurrence of Chinese white dolphins in Taiwan .\n\n\nWith only a few standing records of this species in the past ,\nresearchers recorded their first sightings of Chinese white dolphins near Tai\nChung Harbour during the summer of 2002 .\n\n\nDuring the five-day research cruise , researchers had frequent\nsightings of dolphin groups to confirm that there are quite a few animals in\nthe population along the western coast of Taiwan .\n\n\nHowever , the status of the population needs to be determined by\nfurther research .    \n\n \n\n Xiamen , Fujian Province of PRC  - Apart from the\nhumpback dolphins in the Pearl River Estuary , those in Xiamen are another\npopulation that is well-known to Chinese .\n\n\nUnfortunately the number of dolphins in Xiamen has decreased\ndramatically in the last several decades .\n\n\nDue to various threats caused by human activities , scientists\ngenerally believe that there are no more than 100 animals surviving in the\nXiamen Harbour .   \n\n \n\n Beihai , Guangdong Province of PRC  - Only recently\n, the humpback dolphins in this area have started to receive some attention\nfrom scientists .\n\n\nThey are mostly distributed along two mudflats near the estuary .\n\n\nA preliminary study on their abundance and ecology is currently\nunderway .   \n\n \n\n South Africa  - The physical appearance of the\nSouth African humpback dolphins is clearly different from those in Hong Kong .\n\n\nThey have a hump on their back just below the dorsal fin , which is\nhow they got the name \" humpback &rdquo; dolphin .\n\n\nTheir colour throughout different life stages is dark gray in colour\nwithout too much variation .\n\n\nThe humpback dolphins in South Africa are mostly distributed along\nthe coastal waters of South Africa , usually occurring in waters within 1 km\nof the coast .   \n\n \n\n Thailand  - The picture shown here was taken from a\ngroup of humpback dolphins living in a captive environment in the Underwater\nWorld of Singapore .\n\n\nThey are originally captured from the Gulf of Thailand .\n\n\nInformation on humpback dolphins in Thailand is scarce , and their\nbody colour pattern is also quite different from those in South Africa or\nsouthern coast of China .   \n\n \n\n Australia  - The body colour of Australian humpback\ndolphins is similar to their counterparts in South Africa , and they are dark\ngray in colour from newborn to adult stages .\n\n\nThey are mainly distributed in the coastal waters along the northern\nand northeastern coast of Australia .    \n\n\n Looking for different individuals - Photo identification\n  \n\n \n\nTo better understand the life of dolphins , researchers need to\nidentify every single individual using photo-identification techniques .\n\n\nTo identify individual dolphins with unique characteristics ,\nresearchers usually use a long-lens autofocus camera to take up close shots\nof the dolphins ' body features , such as the nicks and shapes of the dorsal\nfin , or wound marks left on the body .\n\n\nThen the photographs will be matched with the photo-ID catalogue to\nsee whether the individual dolphin was sighted before or it is a new record\nfor the catalog .\n\n\nSo far researchers have already identified over 260 individual\ndolphins in Hong Kong and the Pearl River Estuary , and this information\nhelps us to understand their home range , movement patterns and life history .\n\n\nHere I would like to introduce a few familiar friends that we\nencounter frequently in our waters...   \n\n \n\n Square Fin  (  NL24 ) \n\n \n\nThe distinct feature of this mature adult is its square-shaped\ndorsal fin , which can be easily recognized in the field .\n\n\nSquare Fin is the most commonly seen dolphin in Hong Kong , with over\n60 resightings in the past seven years .\n\n\nIts home range comprises the waters near the Brothers and Lung Kwu\nChau , but it also occasionally occurs in waters near Tai O .   \n\n \n\n Ringo  (  NL11 ) \n\n \n\nThe circular wound around Ringo  ' s head makes  ' her ' the most\nnoticeable individual by the researchers and dolphin-watchers .\n\n\nHer wound was probably created by a fishing net when she was once\nentangled in it .\n\n\nRingo mostly occurs around the waters of Lung Kwu Chau .\n\n\nSince Ringo was seen swimming with a calf a few years ago , we can\nthen determine that Ringo is a female dolphin .   \n\n \n\n Curly  (  NL111 ) \n\n \n\nCurly is a spotted juvenile with the trailing edge of its dorsal\nfin curled backward . This is believed to be caused by a cut .\n\n\nSince the first sighting of Curly in 1998 , Curly has become one of\nthe most commonly encountered individuals , mostly occurring in waters around\nthe Brothers .   \n\n \n\n Scar  (  E107 ) \n\n \n\nThis heavily spotted juvenile is believed to be a male dolphin .\n\n\nThe range of Scar  ' s sightings is quite extensive .\n\n\nBefore 1997 , Scar usually occurred in waters east of Lantau Island ,\nbut since then it has mostly occurred near the Brothers .    \n\n\n Other cetacean species discovered in Hong Kong  \n\n\n \n\nEvery year , there are some cetaceans found stranded on Hong Kong\nbeaches , and most of them are Chinese white dolphins and finless porpoises ,\nwhich are residents of Hong Kong waters .\n\n\nHowever , once in a while researchers also discovered some other rare\nspecies , which are probably washed ashore from offshore waters , or getting\nlost to Hong Kong and stranded on beach .\n\n\nAccording to the official records , there were a total of 14\ncetaceans species recorded in Hong Kong , and let  ' s take a look at some of\nthe stranding cases...   \n\n \n\n (  a ) Bottlenose dolphin (   Tursiops truncatus  )\n  \n\n \n\nThere are quite a few standing records of the bottlenose dolphins\nin Hong Kong , probably due to their preference for coastal habitat .\n\n\nAmong these , there were two stranding incidents with live-stranded\nanimal .\n\n\nFor example , the one shown in this picture was stranded on a mudflat\nat Sheung Pak Nai inside Deep By in March 1986 .   \n\n \n\n (  b ) Long-beaked common dolphin (    Delphinus\n capensis   )   \n\n \n\nTwo large groups of long-beaked common dolphins have been sighted\nin Victoria Harbour and Sai Kung respectively in the past , and there were\nalso a few stranding cases of this species in Hong Kong . The fresh carcass\nof common dolphin was found stranded in Shap Long on Lantau Island in 1989 .\n  \n\n \n\n (  c ) Striped dolphin (   Stenella coeruleoalba  )\n  \n\n \n\nThere were a total of five records of striped dolphins stranded\nin Hong Kong , and the picture shown here is a striped dolphin stranded on\nPui O beach on Lantau Island , which died not long time ago .   \n\n \n\n (  d ) Bottlenose dolphin   \n\n \n\nAnother bottlenose dolphin stranded alive in Silvermine Bay of\nLantau Island in August 1983 .   \n\n \n\n (  e ) Striped dolphin   \n\n \n\nAnother striped dolphin stranded in Tai Long Wan of Hong Kong\nIsland in 1994 .   \n\n \n\n (  f ) Bottlenose dolphin   \n\n \n\nThis group of bottlenose dolphins was sighted in waters east of\nthe Po Toi Islands in 1998 .   \n\n \n\n (  g ) Pygmy sperm whale (    Kogia \nbreviceps   )   \n\n \n\nPygmy sperm whales mostly occur in deep water region , but there\nare still four stranding records of this species in Hong Kong .\n\n\nThe recent incident was a pygmy sperm whale stranded near a boat\nclub in Sai Kung in 1992 .   \n\n \n\n (  h ) False killer whale (   Pseudorca crassidens  )\n  \n\n \n\nIn addition to two live sighting cases , there were three\nstranding records of false killer whales in Hong Kong (  the first two is in\nTai Lam Chung in 1983 and in Tsin Yue Wan of Lantau Island in 2000 ) .\n\n\nThe recent incident was well publicized , with a live false killer\nwhale stranded on Sai Wan beach in Sai Kung in August 2002 .   \n\n \n\n (  i ) Risso  ' s dolphin (   Grampus griseus  )\n  \n\n \n\nRisso  ' s dolphin does not occur frequently in Hong Kong , but\nthere was an uncommon incident with four risso  ' s dolphins stranded in Tolo\nHarbour within a few days in June 1986 . One of them is shown in this picture .\n  \n\n \n\n (  j ) Fraser  ' s dolphin (   Lagenodelphis hosei  )\n  \n\n \n\nCurrently Fraser  ' s dolphin is still a poorly known species to\nscientist .\n\n\nThey mainly occur in tropical waters , including those in\nPhilippines and Taiwan .\n\n\nThis Fraser  ' s dolphin , the first and only record in Hong Kong ,\nwas stranded on a rocky shore in Tai Po in March of 1995 .   \n\n \n\n (  k ) Bryde  ' s whale (   Balaenoptera edeni  )\n  \n\n \n\nThe Bryde  ' s whale stranded in 1994 was trapped by an\nanti-smuggling steel cable and finally dead .\n\n\nThis is the second stranding record of Bryde  ' s whale in Hong Kong .\n\n\nIn addition , there was another live stranded Bryde  ' s whale found\nin Macau in 2000 .   \n\n\n What can we do when we encounter a stranded dolphin ? \n\n\n \n\nEvery year there are a number of dolphins found washed ashore in\nHong Kong .\n\n\nSince 1975 , AFCD has established a cetacean stranding investigation\nprogramme , allowing researchers to collect some basic information and\nsamples from the stranded cetaceans for various studies and determining the\ncause of death .\n\n\nSample collected such as teeth can be used for age determination;\nblubber , liver and kidney can be used in ecotoxicological analysis; and\nstomach content can be used for studying their feeding habits . \n\n \n\nWhen we encounter a stranded cetacean carcass , what should we\ndo to help the researchers ?\n\n\nIn fact we should inform AFCD staff immediately at their 24 hour\nstranding hotline (  2377-1661 or 7116-3898\n#3029 ) .\n\n\nThe informant should provide details such as the date , time and\nlocation of the discovery , and the size , colour , special features and\ndecomposition state of the stranded animal .\n\n\nAll this information can aid the researcher to decide what kind of\naction is needed to attend the standing event . \n\n \n\nIf you happen to find a cetacean stranded alive on beach , you\nshould contact AFCD immediately and provide any details .\n\n\nWith the instruction from cetacean experts and AFCD staff , there\nare several things you can do to relieve the pain of the stranded cetacean\nbefore the investigation team arrives .\n\n\nYou can cover the animal with wet clothes (  but do not cover its\nblowhole , eyes and fins ) to avoid sunburn or heat loss in cold weather .\n\n\nYou can also dig holes underneath its pectoral fins to release the\ntremendous pressure exerted on the abdomen of the animal .\n\n\nUnrelated people should not surround the stranded animal as a crowd\nmay exert much stress to the animal .\n\n\nNo one should pull or drag the fins of the animal (  including its\npectoral fins , dorsal fins and fluke ) as these are their most delicate body\nparts .\n\n\nFinally , no one should attempt to push the animal back to water or\ntry to rescue the animal , which might cause greater harm to the cetacean .\n\n\nWe should wait for experienced cetacean researchers and\nveterinarians to decide what is the best way to handle the animal .\n\n\nWe should bear in mind that all decisions and actions should be made\nwith the animal welfare as the first priority , and we should not impose our\nown personal feelings and desires on the suffering animal .   \n\n\n Finless porpoises - neighbours of Chinese white dolphins\n  \n\n \n\nThose who have read volume 7 and 8 of  Hong Kong Discovery\n should be quite familiar with finless porpoises , another resident\ncetacean in Hong Kong waters .\n\n\nAlthough both finless porpoises and Chinese white dolphins reside in\nHong Kong waters , they are very different in terms of appearance ,\ndistribution and ecology .\n\n\nLet  ' s have a review on the information about these engaging animals !\n\n\n \n\n  Appearance   - Finless porpoises do not\nhave a long rostrum or dorsal fin on their back , and their body colour has\nno variation throughout their life , which is mainly dark gray in colour .\n\n\n \n\n  Distribution   - They usually occur in\neastern and southern waters of Hong Kong , with obvious seasonal variations\nin distribution . \n\n \n\n  Abundance   - The number of finless\nporpoises in Hong Kong peaks in spring with about 152 animals , while the\nautumn has the lowest number of porpoises with only 55 animals . \n\n \n\n  Behaviour   - They are very shy and\nelusive animals , with rapid movement on the water surface to take a brief\nbreath .\n\n\nThey seldom perform any aerial behaviour . \n\n \n\n  Body length   - Newborn calves are about\n70cm in length , while adults can grow up to 1.8m . \n\n \n\n  Prey preference   - In addition to\ncoastal fish species , finless porpoises also prey on squid and shrimp as\ntheir main prey items . \n\n \n\n  Life span   - Porpoises seldom live up\nto about 20 years of age , but a few individuals in Hong Kong were determined\nto be over 30 years old ! \n\n \n\n  Global distribution   - They are\ndistributed from the Persian Gulf in the west and southern Japan in the north\nto Indonesian waters in the south .\n\n\nThey are also widely distributed in the coastal waters of China ,\nincluding Yellow Sea , Bohai , East and South China Seas .\n\n\nThere is even a freshwater population of finless porpoises residing\nin the Yangtze river .   \n\n\n Reminders for Dolphin watching activities    \n\n\n Where to watch Chinese white dolphins...   \n\n \n\nThe best places to observe Chinese white dolphins are mainly in\nthe western waters of Hong Kong .\n\n\nThese include the waters around Lung Kwu Chau , Sha Chau , the\nBrothers , Black Point , the northeastern corner of airport platform , and\nCastle Peak Power Station on the northern side of Lantau Island .\n\n\nIn addition , dolphin watchers can find dolphins fairly easily along\nthe west coast of Lantau including waters near Tai O and Peaked Hill .\n\n\nDolphin watchers can depart from piers at Tung Chung or Tuen Mun\nwhich are near to Hong Kong western waters to minimize idling time spent on\nthe boat .   \n\n\n What to bring...   \n\n \n\n? Wear comfortable , light clothing and shoes .\n\n\nUnder cold and windy weather , be sure to wear a windbreaker or a\ncoat , and bring a raincoat when it rains . \n\n \n\n? Those who may get seasick should take some sea-sickness pills\n30 minutes before boarding the dolphin watching boat . \n\n \n\n? To avoid getting a sunburn , remember to wear a hat and apply\nsome sunblock . \n\n \n\n? Sunlight reflected from water surfaces can hurt your eyes , so\nwearing a pair of sunglasses is recommended . \n\n \n\n? Make sure to reduce as much waste as possible , and bring all\nthe trash back on land to dispose of it .  \n\n\n\n Other tips...   \n\n \n\n? In order to enrich your dolphin watching experience , you\nshould choose a dolphin operator with good practices and ample experience .\n\n\nThe operator should also be able to provide the most accurate and\nupdated information on the Chinese white dolphins . \n\n \n\n? Be familiar with the code of conduct for dolphin watching\nactivities adopted by the AFCD , and make sure the boat driver can follow\nthese guidelines without harassing the dolphins . \n\n \n\n? During the trip , be sure to hold onto the handrail , as the\nboat may rock back and forth when vessels or high speed ferries pass by\nfrequently in dolphin habitat . \n\n \n\n? After locating a dolphin group , the crowd should avoid\ncongregating on one side of the boat or it could tilt at an angle .\n\n\nRemember that the dolphins will swim all around the boat instead of\nstaying on one side of the boat .\n\n\nSo participants should be patient to stay where they are and the\ndolphins will finally swim to your side . \n\n \n\n? The chance of seeing dolphins really depends on weather and\nsea conditions on that day , and the chance could be lower in heavy rain ,\nlow visibility or rough sea conditions .\n\n\nAlso , participants should understand that Chinese white dolphins\nare wild animals , and they are not living to entertain and please us , but\nthey are engaged in their own daily activities .\n\n\nTherefore , be easy minded , and patiently wait and observe , and\nyou may be lucky enough to see some dolphins close by ! \n\n \n\n? The most important thing is to realize that dolphin watchers\nare visiting the home of dolphins , where everyone should behave as a\nconsiderate visitor .\n\n\nLet the dolphins to decide whether they approach or flee from our\nboats , instead of keep chasing them .   \n\n\n Guidelines for dolphin-watching activities   \n\n \n\nTo observe dolphins in the wild is definitely a memorable\nexperience .\n\n\nHowever , while we are watching the dolphins , are we concerned\nabout how they feel ?\n\n\nSimilar to humans , the dolphins need space to feed , play and rest .\n\n\nOur visit to their home has already caused some disturbance to their\ndaily life .\n\n\nIf we attempt to get closer and chase them desperately , the\ndisturbance will become large enough to cause stress and negative impacts on\ntheir health .\n\n\nIn order to minimize the disturbance to the dolphins during dolphin\nwatching activities , AFCD has set a code of conduct for these activities ,\nhoping all dolphin watching tour operators and dolphin waters can obey these\nrules .   \n\n\n Code of conduct for dolphin watching activities  \n\n\n \n\n1.\n\n\nBasic principle: always observe from a distance , do not seek to\ncontact , touch , feed or harm dolphins in the wild . \n\n \n\n2.\n\n\nWhen dolphins are sighted , maintain forward progress at a slow and\nsteady speed or stop with no sudden course change .\n\n\nNever conduct reverse throttling in the vicinity of dolphins . Boat\nspeed should not exceed 10 knots .\n\n\nWhen observing dolphins , always parallel the dolphin  ' s course at\nslow speed . \n\n \n\n3.\n\n\nNever approach dolphins head on; approach at an angle . \n\n \n\n4. Only one dolphin watching vessel should be within 500 metres\nof a group of dolphins at any one time . \n\n \n\n5.

{"text": "Snake Friend or Foe   \n\n\n Louis Cheung   \n\n\nKadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden   \n\n \n\nThere are altogether 49 native species of snakes in Hong Kong ,\nall of which belong to six families: Typhiopidae , Boidae , Colubridae ,\nElapidae , Hydrophiidae and Viperidae .\n\n\nPeople generally have the misconception that all snakes are poisonous .\n\n\nIn fact , most snakes are harmless .\n\n\nCurrently there are only nine species of highly venomous\nland snakes in Hong Kong , four of which are wither uncommon or\nrarely seen .\n\n\nThere are five other kinds of snakes that are only mildly \nvenomous (  venom may cause short-term\nswelling , pain , headache , nausea  ) .\n\n\nTherefore , a fatal snakebite is quite rare in Hong Kong .  \n\n \n\nVenom of venomous snakes is the most powerful and effective\ntool for killing prey within a short period of time .\n\n\nAfter venom  is injected into the prey  ' s body ,\nan enzyme in the  venom  starts pre-digesting the body\ntissue before the snake consumes the prey .\n\n\nAs  venom  is valuable to the snake itself , it\nwill not waste a drop of it unless it is necessary .\n\n\nYou may sometimes hear that people got bitten by a Cobra without\nbeing poisoned , as no  venom  was injected .\n\n\nNevertheless , one should always beware of the snakebites as it is\nimpossible to tell exactly when a snake will inject its venom . \n\n \n\nSnakes also play an important role in maintaining balance in an\necosystem .\n\n\nThey generally prefer to prey on rats , and thus can control the\nabundance of rats .\n\n\nDespite their ecological important , people often kill snakes\nindiscriminately as they believe all snakes are harmful to mankind .\n\n\nBesides , snakes are frequently caught in the wild and then sold in\nanimal market as South China is a larger consumer of wild snakes for food .\n\n\nTogether with other human pressure such as habitat destruction , man\nhas posed a great threat to these widely misunderstood creatures . \n\n \n\nThe existence of a healthy population of snakes is critical to\nmaintaining a healthy food web .\n\n\nWith better understanding , we can be friends with snakes and live\nwith them in harmony !  \n\n\n Do you know ?  \n\n \n\nSnakes have a very good sense of smell .\n\n\nThey use their forked tongues to detect chemical particles in the air\n, and then find out where their prey is .\n\n\nSome snakes have very good eyesight , like the Colubridae , which\nhunt with their keen vision as well as sense of smell .\n\n\nOthers like vipers and pythons have a pair of infra-red heat pits ,\nwhich detect body heat of warm-blooded animals .\n\n\nWith this tool , the snakes of this family can detect their prey in\ntotal darkness .  \n\n \n\n Here we introduce HK  ' s terrestrial  venomous\n\nsnakes .\n\n\nNext time we will show you some common non-venomous\n\nsnakes in the territory .     \n\n\n Chinese Cobra  (    Naja  atra\n  )  \n\n \n\n ID features:  Adult Chinese cobra is about 1 m long\n, and is usually black in colour with irregular white spots or banding on the\nbody; but brown , grey or golden Chinese cobra can sometimes be found ,\nespecially in the northeastern part of the New territories . \n\n \n\n Habit:  The Chinese Cobra is the most common\n\nvenomous  land snake in Hong Kong according to our\nrecords .\n\n\nIt can be found in a great variety of habitats: scrubland , grassland\n, fishpond and open area .\n\n\nIf frightened , it will expand its neck hood and create a hissing\nsound in order to scare the predators away .    \n\n\n King cobra  (    Ophiophagus \nHannah   )  \n\n \n\n ID features:  Fully-grown adult is a huge version\nof Chinese cobra that can reach 6 m in length .\n\n\nTheir body is dark brown or black in colour with transverse bands .\n\n\nThe body of juvenile King cobra is also black in colour , but instead\nit bears bright yellow/golden bands .\n\n\nCompared with the Chinese cobra , the King cobra  ' s neck hood is\nlonger and narrower .\n\n\nIn addition , two distinctively enlarged postparietal scales can be\nseen on the snakes ' head . \n\n \n\n Habit:  The King cobra isn't simply the  ' King ' of\ncobras , it can be regarded as the  ' King ' of land  venomous\n\nsnakes because it is the largest  venomous \nsnake , and it likes to prey on other snakes !\n\n\nSimilar to the Chinese cobra , it occurs in a various kinds of\nhabitats .\n\n\nFemale will make their egg chamber among leaves or plant debris , and\nthey incubate their eggs with the heat generated by shivering .\n\n\nThose females guarding their eggs are reported to be the most\ndangerous snakes to human .\n\n\nNonetheless , King cobra is not commonly seen in Hong Kong . \n\n \n\nRemarks: King cobra can be found frequently sold in Hong Kong\nsnake shop , which serves as a nourishing food item .  \n \n\n\n Many-banded Krait  (    Bungarus \nmulticinctus multicinctus   )  \n\n \n\n ID features:  Adult many-banded krait is about 1 m\nlong .\n\n\nIt has obvious black and white bandings all over the body .\n\n\nIts most distinctive feature is the enlarged vertebral scales . \n\n \n\n Habit:  Many-banded krait is mainly nocturnal .\n\n\nIt can be found extensively in different habitats from forest to\nmarsh land .\n\n\nIt is a common  venomous  snake in Hong Kong .\n   \n\n\n Banded Krait  (    Bungarus \nfasciatus   )  \n\n \n\n ID features:  Banded krait  ' s black and yellow\nbandings throughout the body make it an unmistakable snake .\n\n\nIts body cross-section is triangular , and its tail is short and\nblunt . \n\n \n\n Habit:  Banded krait mainly feeds on other snakes .\n\n\nIt is not as common as the many-banded krait .\n\n\nIt is also nocturnal , and often inhabits lowlands like marshes and\ncultivated fields .    \n\n\n Bamboo Snake  (   Trimeresurus albolabris  )\n \n\n \n\n ID features:  Bamboo snake has a triangular head .\n\n\nIts whole body is green in colour with a red tail , while its ventral\nside is pale yellow in colour . \n\n \n\n Habit:  Bamboo snake is the second commonest\n\nvenomous  snake in Hong Kong .\n\n\nIt becomes the culprit in most snakebite cases because of its lazy\nand aggressive behaviours .\n\n\nNormally bamboo snakes will not avoid people .\n\n\nInstead , when there is someone approaching , they will curve their\nbody in S-shape and get ready to strike the invader .\n\n\nBamboo snakes like to hide under leaves or in grassland .\n\n\nIts green  camouflage  renders it being difficult\nto see .\n\n\nThe snakebite is reported to be painful and swelling , but it is\nrarely fatal to a healthy human .    \n\n\n Mountain Pit Viper  (   Trimeresurus monticola\nmakazayaya   )  \n\n \n\n ID features:  Its body is stocky , and it is\ngrey-brown in colour with deep brown patches pattern on the back .\n\n\nIts head is triangular in share , and its head scales are rather\ngranular .\n\n\nIt bears a pair of pits for hear detection .\n\n\nIt is rarely seen in the territory . \n\n \n\n Habit:  Mountain pit viper can be found in mountain\nareas with altitude of about 900 m . It is primarily nocturnal , and it likes\nto hide underneath rocks or other objects during the daytime .    \n\n\n Coral Snake  (   Calliophis macclellandi  )\n \n\n \n\n ID feature:  Coral snake is about 40-60 cm in\nlength .\n\n\nIts body is red-brown in colour with some incomplete black bandings .\n\n\nThere is a white band on its small head . \n\n \n\n Habit:  Coral snake is rather uncommon in Hong Kong .\n\n\nIt often inhabits forest .\n\n\nIt is a kind of nocturnal snake , and it primarily feeds on other\nsmall snakes .    \n\n\n Red-necked Keelback  (   Rhabdophis subminiatus\nhelleri   )  \n\n \n\n ID feature:  Its body is olive green in colour .\n\n\nIts name comes from the red patch on its neck (  for some adults the\npatches are not so obvious ) .\n\n\nThe red patch is especially conspicuous in juvenile . \n\n \n\n Habit:  Normally it can be found in forest or\nscrubland , especially near water source .\n\n\nIt is active during the day and night .\n\n\nIt primarily preys on frogs and toads .    \n\n\n Taiwan  habu  snake  (  \nTrimeresurus mucrosquamatus   )  \n\n \n\n ID feature:  Taiwan  habu  snake\n( Turtle-designed snake ) is about 60-100 cm long , is a native species\nrecently discovered in Hong Kong .\n\n\nIt bears a  camouflage  of beige to brown colour ,\nwith irregular dark brown to black patches .\n\n\nIts  camouflage  enables the snake to hide within\nthe fallen leaves well .\n\n\nIts head is triangular with a pair of heat sensing pits . \n\n \n\n Habit:  Taiwan  habu  snake in\nHong Kong is a poorly known species in Hong Kong .\n\n\nAll specimens collected are  carcasses  found in\nroad kill .\n\n\nIt mainly inhabits scrubland , as well as forest .\n\n\nIt is primarily nocturnal but sometimes found active during the\ndaytime . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Water Works   \n\n\n Is expensive mineral water about good health or good\nmarketing ?  \n\n \n\n W  e  ' ve all been told we need to drink eight\nglasses of water a day , but how do you know which kind ?\n\n\nThere  ' s carbonated , mineral , oxygenated ... even waters promising\nto deliver the same advantages as a cup of coffee or Viagra .\n\n\nDo you believe the hype , or do you suspect a &dollar;29 bottle of\nwater is just as food as the stuff coming out of your tap ?  \n\n\n Hard or Soft ?  \n\n \n\nDoctors and nutritionists break down water into two categories -\nsoft water and hard water .\n\n\nHard water has a high mineral content and should , in theory , offer\nmore health benefits .\n\n\nSoft water , distilled water for example , does not have mineral\ncontent , therefore it doesn't really offer much .\n\n\nBut because the minerals affect the taste of the water , not\neveryone likes the hard stuff .\n\n\nIn fact , Nick Reitmeier , General manager of Great Supermarket ,\nexplains that , of the 60 brands of water Great sells , some are definitely\nmore palatable because they don't have any mineral content .  \n\n\n Claim to Fame  \n\n \n\nMineral waters labels make bold claims about fresh volcanic\nsprings and natural mountain minerals .\n\n\nAnd the truth is , our bodies actually do require certain minerals\nthat some waters claim to contain , specifically  magnesium\n\nand  calcium  .\n\n\nThere are also two essential minerals a lot of us don't get enough\nof . \n\n \n\nMost of us know  calcium  is stored in our\nbones , about 99% of it , and it  ' s also a vital component for our\nteeth to prevent cavities and fight tooth decay .\n\n\nBut  calcium  is also needed in order for\n\nmagnesium  to work .\n\n\n\nMagnesium  is needed for the building of your\nbones , protein and fatty acids .\n\n\nIt  ' s also essential for making new cells , activating Vitamin B ,\nblood-clotting and muscle relaxation - it may even help lower blood pressure\n, and potentially improve the vision of people suffering from glaucoma . \n\n \n\nBut not all minerals are good for you .\n\n\nMost waters also certain amounts of sodium , which have negative\nside effects .\n\n\nExcessive intake of sodium can cause heart problems , including high\nblood pressure and heart attacks - not to mention water retention and\nbloating .  \n\n\n Is It Enough ?  \n\n \n\nSo if mineral waters really do contain some important minerals ,\nis it really worth the extra cash ?\n\n\nNot according to Dr . Edmund Lee , a Hong Kong University Associate\nProfessor who teaches course on food and nutrition .\n\n\nHe says the  magnesium  and  calcium\n\nintake from mineral water is not significant , and so drinking\nmineral water isn't necessarily the nest way to get these minerals into your\nsystem .\n\n\n\" Of course I am not saying people should stop drinking\nmineral water .\n\n\nHowever , it is just not practical to rely on the water for mineral\nsupply .\n\n\nIn general , a person needs about 100mg of  calcium\n\nevery day .\n\n\nWhile mineral water can only fulfil a small percentage of what our\nbody needs , milk , as a matter of fact , is a lot more practical .\n\n\nOne serving of milk can meet 30% of our daily \ncalcium  needs .\n\n\nComparatively speaking , mineral water doesn't really help that much .\n&rdquo; \n\n \n\nJohnny Hanson , one of the founders of the American Nutrition\nCenter , agrees .\n\n\n\" Mineral water does not have a significant amount of the minerals\nthat we need , it  ' s not enough to make a big difference . &rdquo;\n\n\nHe does , however , point a different advantage .\n\n\n\" I do recommend those who participate in marathon sports -\nfor example those who run and hike for a long time - to take mineral water in\norder to replace the electrolytes they have lost in sweat . &rdquo;\n\n\nElectrolytes are important in maintaining voltage across cell\nmembranes and to carry electrical impulses between nerve cells and muscle\ncells .  \n\n\n Healthy Waters  \n\n \n\nThen there are the waters that are considered to have real\nmedicinal purposes .\n\n\nAccording to Great  ' s Reitmeier , a lot of European doctors suggest\npatients drink Apollinaris - which they call \" health water . &rdquo;\n\n\nAppollinaris has high levels of  magnesium  ( \n6% ) and low levels of sodium (  4%); ideal for those with\ndigestive problems , they say . \n\n \n\nThere might be some truth to this , as HKU  ' s Dr . Lee mentions\nthat people who live in areas with hard water tend to have better general\nhealth - assuming they  ' re drinking out of the tap . -  Katie Luk \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Night Heron (    Nycticorax nycticorax \n  )    \n\n\nSamson So  \n\n \n\nNighttime seems to be specially designed for owls .\n\n\nHowever , some herons such as the Night Herons share the silence\nwith these night creatures .\n\n\nThe Night Heron is a nocturnal bird which forages at night ,\nalthough it can also be seen during daytime especially during breeding season .\n\n\nAdult Night Heron can easily be separable with other kinds of\nherons: the dorsal side of the bird is dark blue in colour , with a couple of\nelongated plumage extended behind the head .\n\n\nThe wings are white and the ventral side is grayish , bit of these\nare visible when the bird is in flight .\n\n\nTake a closer look and you can even see the bright red eyes and\nyellow feet .\n\n\nImmature Night Heron is brownish and covered with white spots ,\nwhich act as an excellent  camouflage  for it to avoid\npredators . \n\n \n\nThe Night Heron breeds in colony like may other egrets and\nherons do .\n\n\nWetlands such as shrimp ponds , fishponds and other shallow waters\nare the major foraging habitats for the species , where they hunt for small\nfish and shrimps .\n\n\nAt dusk flock upon flock can be seen departing from the daytime\nroost towards the foraging grounds , and by dawn they will return .\n\n\nNight Heron can also be seen in urban parks , which provides\nexcellent viewing conditions .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a315097c-e693-4ffc-92ca-093b47757424", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.891922+00:00"}

{"text": "A STRATEGY FOR HONG KONG INDUSTRIES , INC.  \n\n\nBy S. C. Fung  \n\n\nThe Problem \n\n \n\nShould the Hong Kong Government formulate an industrial strategy ?\n\n\n \n\nIt might sound outlandish to pose such a question , especially\nwhen the Government has pointed out time and again that the policy decision\nto intervene as little as possible has been a sound one , and that the\nindustrial sector has been doing just fine .\n\n\nFurthermore , some actions indicate that the Government already has an\nindustrial strategy . \n\n \n\nIn a bid to enhance the international competitiveness of Hong Kong\nindustries and boost R&D and human resource development ( HRD )\n, the Government has established a multi-million dollar industrial technology\ncentre and a new university .\n\n\nPlans for an Industrial Development Council ( IDC ) to\nfurther what is being done by the Industry Development Board ( IDB\n) are already at an advanced stage .\n\n\nThe Government is also considering setting up a science park and a\nthird industrial estate for hi-tech development . \n\n \n\nThe establishment of this new infrastructure , however , must be\naccompanied , if not preceded by , a specific strategy .\n\n\nCalls still abound for better coordination of , and more long-term\nplanning for , Hong Kong  ' s industrial development . \n\n \n\nDr. T. Y. Fok of the Productivity Council has contended , for\nexample , that both the industrial technology centre and the University of\nScience and Technology lack the resources needed to turn their graduates into\napplied technologists . \n\n \n\nDr. Charles Kao , Vice-Chancellor of the Chinese University , on\nthe other hand , has defended the relevance of basic research by saying that\nadopting a follower  ' s strategy to catch up with technological advancement\nwill never put Hong Kong in a better competitive position . \n\n \n\nSome , if not most , academics would agree that Hong Kong  ' s\nspending an estimated .05 percent of its GDP on R&D , as compared to\nSingapore  ' s .90 percent ( GNP ) , Taiwan  ' s 1.90 percent\n( GNP ) and South Korea  ' s 2.60 percent ( GNP ) ,\nis not doing much for Hong Kong  ' s economy .\n\n\nThe current research budget for all seven UPGC institutions amounts\nto HK&dollar;100 million , as compared to an annual R&D Budget of\nHK&dollar;3900 for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United\nStates . \n\n \n\nWithout help from the Government , the institutions of higher\nlearning here are not going to get the kind of money they need to conduct\ndecent research works . \n\n \n\nOther problems which need to be addressed with a proactive\nindustrial strategy include productivity , industrial restructuring ,\ninternationalisation , the &lsquo; symbiotic &rdquo; relationship with the\nPearl River Delta area , and above all Hong Kong  ' s international\ncompetitiveness . \n\n \n\nThese problems are interrelated , and finding their solutions\nshould be a strategic priority for the Government .\n\n\nThis will require a mass mobilisation of resources .\n\n\nIt will require foresight and administrative leadership .\n\n\nIt will also demand a willingness on the part of business leaders to\nput long-term interests at the forefront of their agenda and follow a\nGovernment lead .\n\n\nThese are urgent matters if Hong Kong wants to remain competitive\nthrough the next century .  \n\n\nAssumptions \n\n \n\nTo date , the Government has based their industrial planning on\nfour assumptions , namely : ( 1 ) Hong Kong  ' s prosperity\ndepends on its ability to export; ( 2 ) the manufacturing\nsector will continue to be both a major employer and an important contributor\nto Hong Kong  ' s exports; ( 3 ) Hong Kong will continue to face\ncompetition in its major export markets from other Asian competitors; and\n( 4 ) the pattern and level of demand for the output of Hong\nKong  ' s manufacturing industries is constantly changing .\n\n\n( Source : Hong Kong Government Industry Department Report ,\n1989-90 ) . \n\n \n\nThe Government rightly stresses the importance of flexibility in\nthe manufacturing sector and competitiveness .\n\n\nHowever , such assumptions must be continually refined to suit Hong\nKong  ' s changing competitive environment . \n\n \n\nFirstly , the more traditional role of Hong Kong as an entrepot\nhas re-emerged in recent years .\n\n\nAlthough the growth rates of both re-exports and domestic exports\nhave declined from 1988 to 1990 ( from 50.7 to 19.5 percent for the\nformer; from 11.5 to 8 percent for the latter ) , the absolute values\nof re-exports have invariably surpassed those of domestic exports in the same\nperiod . \n\n \n\nSecondly , the gap between the service and manufacturing sectors\n&rsquo; contributions to the economy is widening .\n\n\nService sector contribution to GDP increased from 60 to 67 percent\nover the years 1970 to 1989 .\n\n\nDuring this same period , the contribution of the manufacturing\nsector declined from 31 to 18 percent . \n\n \n\nSimilarly the proportion of the work force employed by the\nservice sector has grown from 41 to 62 percent from 1971 to 1990 , while that\nof the manufacturing sector has decreased from 47 to 28 percent . \n\n \n\nThirdly , the betterment of the service sector , notably in\nfinance , technology transfer , and business logistics , has enabled Hong\nKong manufacturers to engage in off-shore production and production sharing .\n\n\nIt has been estimated that between 1.5 to 2.0 million Chinese workers\nin the Pearl River Delta area are employed by Hong Kong manufacturers . \n\n \n\nFourthly , the number of competitors in the manufacturing sector\nhas been growing in recent years .\n\n\nIt has been tipped that Thailand and not surprising the Pearl River\nDelta area will join the league of dragons before the little but older\ndragons can turn themselves into something else . \n\n \n\nFifthly , the emergence of the Asia-Pacific as one of three major\ntrade blocs and the rapid growth of intra-regional trade have further\nencouraged the expansion of Hong Kong  ' s service sector .\n\n\nCurrently the Asia-Pacific region jointly accounts of 60 percent of\nHong Kong  ' s trade volumes , whereas the proportion of Hong Kong  ' s domestic\nexports accounted for by the US market has declined from 42 to 29 percent\nform 1986 to 1990 . \n\n \n\nIn short , what is happening is that the relative importance of\nHong Kong  ' s domestic exports , manufacturing sector , and traditional\nmarkets and competitors is changing .\n\n\nIf one scans the environment , one can see that our competitors are\nbecoming our customers . \n\n \n\nWithin this environment , it is unfortunate that the Government  ' s\nmain   priorities  ( as spelled out by the\nIndustry Department Report ) are inward looking only .\n\n\nAlthough the recognition that demand and production patterns in the\nmanufacturing sector are changing ( #4 ) hints at the need\nfor more outward looking strategies , this is not enough . \n\n \n\nIn short , creating the ability for Hong Kong to respond to a\nchanging competitive environment is not being sufficiently addressed . \n\n\n\nGoals \n\n \n\nThe stated goal of the Government  ' s industrial policies is\n\" to improve the real earnings of employers and employees in\nmanufacturing by helping them to improve real output per head &rdquo; .\n\n\n( Source : Hong Kong Government Industry Department Report\n1988-89 ) . \n\n \n\nSuch a statement merely confirms the universal principle of\nprofitability .\n\n\nIt fails to address the key issue of how resources should be\nallocated to meet demands arising from the internal and external environments .\n The Government  ' s goals are as inward looking as their assumptions .\n\n\n \n\nFurthermore , the Government  ' s laissez-faire means of\nimplementing these policies implies that businessmen are the best judges of\ntheir own interests , and that determining the scale and growth vector of\ninvestment in manufacturing is best left to the private sector .\n\n\nIn this environment , corporate profitability has been mistaken for\nnational competitiveness . \n\n \n\nThere exists , figuratively speaking , a corporation which can\nbest be described as Hong Kong Industries , Inc. ( HKII ) .\n\n\nHKII does not seem to care about what business it is in , that is ,\nin which market and with whom it competes , so long as it is making money .\n\n\n \n\nFor example , core business in the portfolio of HKII include\nclothing , electrical appliances , electronics , plastics , textiles , and\ntimepieces .\n\n\nThese industries were not actively chosen as plum industries for\ntoday  ' s market by HKII  ' s management .\n\n\nRather , this generation of HKII leaders inherited this portfolio\nfrom its predecessors . \n\n \n\nWith this portfolio , HKII should not lose sight of its greater\ngoals to develop a highly competitive industrial sector .\n\n\nIn order to do this , HKII  ' s present management will have to reduce\ncosts and enhance responsiveness to changing customer preferences .\n\n\nThis may lead to losses in employment opportunities , which can make\nit more difficult to choose between supporting losers and aiding winners in\nface of fierce competition . \n\n \n\nBut HKII leaders must make these difficult choices .\n\n\nThey should not allow themselves to be dictated by rules designed for\npast production-oriented generations .\n\n\nEarlier generations enjoyed the benefits of the baby-boom consumption\ncraze .\n\n\nBut goods today do not sell so easily , no matter how impressive the\noutput per worker or how superior the product quality may be . \n\n \n\nIf these old habits continue to dominate the industry ,\nbusinessmen are not necessarily the best judges of Hong Kong  ' s interests .\n\n\n \n\nWho then should be expected to take care of Hong Kong  ' s\ninterests when it comes to making decisions on where and when to put our\ntaxpayers &rsquo; money to use ? \n\n \n\nNot business alone . \n\n \n\nThe responsibility lies with the Trade and Industry Branch , the\nIDB , and the IDC to come up with a market-driven , customer-oriented\nstrategy to secure long-term corporate and societal well-being .  \n\n\nAlternative Strategies \n\n \n\nThe Government seldom resorts to protective measures because of\nbelief in the virtue of a relatively open economy .\n\n\nThe main form of intervention is said to be &lsquo; developmental\n&rsquo; , that is encouraging productivity growth , quality improvement , and\ndesign innovation .\n\n\nThis goes hand in hand with the more general strategy of keeping a\nsuperior physical and marketing infrastructure . \n\n \n\nThe programmes in place to implement these strategies include :\n( 1 ) provision of industrial land; ( 2 )\nprovision of manpower; ( 3 ) determination of market\nconstraints on industrial development; ( 4 ) provision of\nstandards , calibration , and quality certification services; ( 5\n) provision of assistance to overcome technological constraints on\nindustrial development; and ( 6 ) technological advancement .\n\n\n \n\nThis production-oriented &lsquo; strategy &rsquo; .\n\n\ncharacteristic of the 1960s and 1970s , falls short of what is\nrequired of a proactive strategy . \n\n \n\nA case in point is the Trade Description ( Amendment\n) Bill , to be enacted July 1 this year .\n\n\nThe bill allows knitting firms to finish the linking process across\nthe border without fear of not being able to obtain their Country of Origin\nCertificates ( COCs ) .\n\n\nThat has led workers , particularly operators of circular knitting\nmachines , to accuse the Government of colluding with the manufacturers to\nsacrifice their  ' rice bowls for the so-called competitiveness &rsquo; of the\napparel industry . \n\n \n\nTransferring the linking process from local to mainland\nproduction facilities could have been foreseen .\n\n\nArrangement to retrain the operators could have been made a few years\nback when US stipulations delisted the process as a requirement for COCs .\n\n\nYet the Government continued to take into account the linking process\nbefore issuing COCs , which created   a  redundancy in the\nprocess . \n\n \n\nIt is debatable in this case whether the Government was simply\ntoo slow to make a move , or its interpretation of the idea of\ncompetitiveness is too narrow .\n\n\nEither way , it shows that the Government has adopted an approach too\nreactionary and unassuming for shaping one  ' s competitive environment . \n\n \n\nIn addition , focusing on building up a superior infrastructure\nmay destabilise the market , which may be indicated by : ( 1 )\nthe service sector benefiting more than the manufacturing sector because of\nthe former  ' s dependency on infrastructural efficiency; ( 2 )\nfinancial resources being misallocated to infrastructural development; and\n( 3 ) the capital pool becoming smaller and capital investments\nin the industrial sector being reduced . \n\n \n\nThe first alternative to the &lsquo; strategy &rsquo; is to\npursue a growth strategy in knowledge-intensive industries .\n\n\nThe idea is to make use of revenues generated by the labour-intensive\nindustries including clothing , consumer electronics , footwear , textiles ,\ntoys and the material-intensive industries including plastics to support\nindustries with : ( 1 ) a higher technological content (\ne.g. biotechnology and information technology ) ; ( 2 )\nhigher value-added products; and ( 3 ) a rapidly expanding\nworld market . \n\n \n\nAdopting this growth strategy would confirm the contribution of\nthe manufacturing sector to the economy .\n\n\nThe knowledge-intensive industries are thus expected to : ( 1\n) serve a global market; ( 2 ) generate foreign exchange\nearnings; ( 3 ) employ a large portion of the labour force ,\noffering often higher wages than in the service sector; ( 4 )\noptimise the utilisation of labour resources through automation; and (\n5 ) continue providing linkages between the manufacturing and the\nservice sectors . \n\n \n\nThe second alternative is a retrenchment strategy whereby\nindustries will be either consolidated by encouraging mergers of smaller\nfirms and limiting upstream expansions or &lsquo; given away &rsquo; to the\nPearl River Delta area , leaving behind more sophisticated industries and a\nservice-dominant economy .\n\n\nIn this way , Hong Kong will be less burdened by fixed capital\ninvestment in the manufacturing sector and better positioned to play the role\nof an entrepot in the provision of industry-based services such as R&D ,\npurchasing , testing , warehousing , and servicing . \n\n \n\nThis seems to be a more viable alternative at this point in time\nbecause : ( 1 ) there is a global recession , as well as a\ndownturn in more traditional industries; ( 2 ) new service\nindustries keep coming up; ( 3 ) the increase in interest rates\nwill lead to the establishment of more financial enterprises; and ( 4\n) the diffusion of technical changes from Hong Kong to the Pearl River\nDelta area can be achieved with relative ease . \n\n \n\nThe third alternative combines the first two .\n\n\nAn approach based on the Boston Consulting Group matrix would foster\n&lsquo; problem children &rsquo; , invest in the &lsquo; stars &rsquo; , milk\nthe &lsquo; cows &rsquo; , and let the &lsquo; dogs &rsquo; go .\n\n\nThat is , different industries call for different treatments . \n\n \n\nIn this light , the two alternative strategies would complement\neach other , and the combined or two-pronged strategy , if adopted , will\ngive local competitors a long needed sense of direction. Implementation It is\nbelieved that the two-pronged strategy could address issues of competitive\nadvantage , growth vector , strategic flexibility , and synergy .\n\n\nBut there will be difficulties in carrying out the programmes .\n\n\nRestrictions on transferring hi-tech from the US to China , for\ninstance , may hinder growth of local high-tech industries and diffusion of\ntechnical changes to the Pearl River Delta area . \n\n \n\nThe Government may also have to refrain from : ( 1\n) supporting industries already partly through the product life cycle;\n( e ) rationalisation; ( 3 ) providing export\nsubsidies; ( 4 ) supporting firms that are incapable of\npenetrating export markets; and ( 5 ) supporting firms that are\nalready competing successfully in export markets . \n\n \n\nThat is to say , the Government may want to support : ( 1\n) small to medium-sized local firms; ( 2 ) firms\ncompeting in areas where the entry barriers are relatively high; ( 3\n) technologically progressive firms; ( 4 ) firms in\nearly phase of development; ( 5 ) firms with promising\nemployment growth; ( 6 ) firms with above-average\nprofitability; and ( 7 ) firms or R&D projects rather than\nindustries . \n\n \n\nIn order to provide this type of support , the Government must\nmake improvements in three key areas : ( 1 ) HRD; ( 2\n) market information; and ( 3 ) commitment .\n\n\nCurrent efforts to produce R&D personnel and promote market-oriented\nR&D must be stepped up , and the practice of opening up companies to foreign\nmanagerial and technological professionals must be continued .\n\n\nA business intelligence system may have to be set up to process\nmarket information to develop captive technology and proprietary knowledge .\n\n\n \n\nLastly , the Government must demonstrate a commitment to an\nindustrial strategy by delegating authority to certain agencies , and\nembarking on joint leadership with the private sector .\n\n\nThe success of such a strategy will hinge partly on whether the\nprivate sector is willing , and able , to make some technical , social and\npolitical adjustments . \n\n \n\nSuch potential hurdles notwithstanding , an industrial strategy\ncan be formulated without too great a difficulty .\n\n\nAnd time is , of course , not on our side .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d7c3a634-03f7-481d-8240-12063d0794ac", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.894636+00:00"}
{"text": "Time for change  \n\n \n\nUS President George W . Bush has not done any favours for the\nconflict in the Middle East by saying there can be no negotiated settlement\nwithout a change of Palestinian leadership . \n\n \n\nMr Bush did not name Palestinian President Yasser Arafat , but by\ninference he has humiliated him and other members of the Palestinian\nAuthority .\n\n\nIn Monday  ' s speech , the US President said new leaders would ensure a\nprovisional state called Palestine in 18 months and autonomy in three years .\n\n\n \n\nMr Bush was following Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon  ' s lead .\n\n\nMr Sharon claims Mr Arafat is not interested in peace and is therefore\nirrelevant as a negotiating partner . \n\n \n\nIt is a position that angers Palestinians and the Muslim world .\n\n\nIsraeli attempts to stop Palestinian suicide bombers by increased\nreoccupation and construction of a fence will not end the 20-month intifada\nthat has claimed 2,000 lives . \n\n \n\nPalestinians chose Mr Arafat to be their leader in democratic\nelections and is as legitimate a representative as Mr Bush or Mr Sharon .\n\n\nHe has shown his dedication to democracy by promising elections for\nlater this year . \n\n \n\nMr Bush has passed up the opportunity to bring about quick change .\n\n\nYet the US is the only mediator with which both the Israelis and\nPalestinians can talk . \n\n \n\nA void has been created and a new mediator , such as the United\nNations , must quickly intervene .\n\n\nBy appointing a special envoy and putting in place a peacekeeping\nforce , it can make sure suitable conditions exist for negotiations . \n\n \n\nThe UN has the resources and , with resolve , it can give\nIsraelis and Palestinians the best chance for peace . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Probity in tatters  \n\n \n\n\" Irrational exuberance &rdquo; was the inspired\ndescription the US Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan attached to\nhis warning about the dangers of the dotcom boom in the late 1990's . \n\n \n\nBut after the spectacular financial crashes witnessed in the past\nseven months which have left corporate America  ' s reputation for probity in\ntatters , Mr Greenspan  ' s comment seems even more prescient . \n\n \n\nIt was clearly not only the tens of millions of small investors\nwho poured their savings into the dotcom darlings that had lost a grip on\nreality , but also the country  ' s boardroom leaders and the guardians of\ncorporate standards . \n\n \n\nBelieving their own publicity , this daring new breed of\ncorporate adventurers placed themselves above the law and caught the\nregulators , and at least one accountancy giant , asleep at the wheel . \n\n \n\nThe Enron crash and the ill wind blowing on the former\nhigh-fliers of the 1990s have left investors shell shocked amid speculation\nthat there is worse to come .\n\n\nTheir wait ended on Tuesday with the WorldCom disclosures . \n\n \n\nHowever , it is the sheer audacity of the executives ' conduct in\nkeeping US&dollar;3.9 billion (  HK&dollar;29.6 billion ) off the profit and\nloss account by transferring it out of operating expenses and classifying it\nas capital investment that magnifies the cause for concern . \n\n \n\nThe excuse from its auditor , the already doomed Andersen group ,\nthat WorldCom  ' s chief financial officer failed to disclose the transfer , is\nbreathtaking . \n\n \n\nThe Enron collapse involved inventive financial engineering which\nwould have required close scrutiny to discover the scale of it .\n\n\nHowever , in WorldCom  ' s case a routine internal audit , accompanied\nby a few probing questions , would have prised open the can of worms . \n\n \n\nThe relative calm yesterday on international markets indicated\nthat investors had temporarily , at least , halted the display of despair\nseen on Wednesday . \n\n \n\nBut it is far too early to say we are out of the mire and that a\nbounce back is imminent .\n\n\nThe fallout from the current crashes will drag on for months if not\nyears , adding to the crisis of confidence that has enveloped international\nbourses . \n\n \n\nBut the more daunting prospect is that other accountancy horror\nstories await .\n\n\nAfter a decade of rampant bull market conditions it seems unlikely\nthat all the excesses have been uncovered in a mere seven months .\n\n\nAlan Greenspan must be suppressing the temptation to say \" I\ntold you so &rdquo; . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Dose of reality  \n\n \n\nThe Hospital Authority has deftly handled the potentially\nexplosive issue of cutting the salaries of its 50,000 employees .\n\n\nInstead of simply asking its staff to accept pay cuts of between 1.58\nand 4.42 per cent , in line with those ordered for civil servants , chief\nexecutive Dr Ho Shiu-wai and his senior colleagues have set an example by\nslashing their own pay by as much as eight per cent . \n\n \n\nTheir move should go down well with the rest of the staff ,\nespecially as under the Employment Ordinance the authority , like any other\nemployer , can dismiss employees who do not agree to take a pay cut . \n\n \n\nOf course , that is not a step the authority would like to take .\n\n\nNo good employer , not least the Government or the authority , wants\nto cut its staff  ' s pay unless conditions are really harsh . \n\n \n\nHA staff union leaders have expressed regret over the pay cut .\n\n\nBut if they are wise , they should refrain from calling on their\nmembers to take any drastic action to oppose the reduction .\n\n\nThe few civil service unions that are building a war chest to sue the\nGovernment for trying to cut their pay by legislation are getting very little\npublic sympathy . \n\n \n\nInstead of opposing the cut , civil servants and other public\nsector employees should consider the fact that they enjoy much better job\nsecurity than those working for private firms , and their pay will be cut\nonly by very modest amounts . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Restoring confidence  \n\n \n\nBesides the headline-grabbing figures about the Government  ' s\nfall in popularity over the past five years , the Hong Kong Transition\nProject  ' s survey also has some comforting news .\n\n\nThe worries that Hong Kong people expressed five years ago about the\nloss of personal freedoms have diminished , as have fears that were expressed\nat the time of the handover over the growth of corruption . \n\n \n\nWhile in June 1997 , only 45 per cent said they were not worried\nabout personal freedom in the SAR , the figure in April 2002 had risen to 71\nper cent .\n\n\nFears about the loss of press freedom , free speech , free assembly\nand religious freedom have also diminished , with a majority of people saying\nthese issues were not worries at present . \n\n \n\nConfidence in the rule of law , however , has diminished , with\nonly 42 per cent saying they were not worried about this , compared with 56\nper cent in April 2000 , an issue that Tung Chee-hwa would be well advised to\naddress , given the importance of the rule of law to Hong Kong . \n\n \n\nNot surprisingly , the main concerns today are economic .\n\n\nUnemployment is the major worry , and levels of dissatisfaction are\nhigh over the Government  ' s attempts to solve these economic worries . \n\n \n\nMr Tung  ' s major challenge will be to try to persuade people that\nhe has the right people and the right policies to restore Hong Kong  ' s\nprosperity .\n\n\nGiven Hong Kong  ' s heavy dependence on the rest of the world economy\n, the Chief Executive is going to have a difficult time raising his and his\ngovernment  ' s popularity . \n\n \n\nThe survey shows that a majority of those surveyed are\ndissatisfied with government performance on two issues - reducing\nunemployment and implementing education reforms .\n\n\nThe Government has little prospect of reducing unemployment in the\nnear term .\n\n\nBut what it can do to reduce public dissatisfaction is to tackle the\narea of education reform .\n\n\nReducing pollution , also high on the list of public demands , is\nanother area in which the Government should try to produce tangible results .\n\n\nMr Tung  ' s second administration will be judged by its performance in\nthese core areas . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Deeds before greed  \n\n \n\nOne of the sad realities of globalisation is that wealth does not\nequate with generosity . \n\n \n\nA case in point is the Group of Eight meeting just ended in\nCanada .\n\n\nThe world  ' s richest nations have agreed to guarantee their\ncorrespondingly poorest cousins in Africa a mere US&dollar;6 billion ( \nHK&dollar;46.8 billion ) in aid . \n\n \n\nG8 leaders such as Britain  ' s Prime Minister Tony Blair hailed\nthe package as a \" genuine partnership for the renewal of Africa\" .\n\n\nDisappointed aid groups said the conditional pledge was one-sixth of\nwhat was required . \n\n \n\nThe G8 are the same nations whose international corporations have\nbecome wealthy by using the resources and labour of the developing world .\n\n\nBut it is also true that corporate greed and compassion rarely go\nhand-in-hand . \n\n \n\nHumanitarian groups have for years been trying with little\nsuccess to get American and European pharmaceutical companies to lower the\ncost of medication so that hundreds of millions of poverty-stricken people\nin Africa and Asia can fight HIV/Aids and malaria .\n\n\nThat some African countries have had their populations decimated by\nsuch diseases has done little to soften hard hearts . \n\n \n\nIt is an attitude that the governments of developed countries are\nin danger of being accused of .\n\n\nThey are effectively standing by as disease , poverty and drought\ncrush nations . \n\n \n\nSome African nations are not faultless .\n\n\nCorrupt and inept officials have not helped their cause .\n\n\nOthers have spent billions of dollars fighting wars instead of\nfeeding people . \n\n \n\nBut with developing nations increasing defence budgets and\ndecreasing aid , there is little doubt that resolve to bring about a change\nis not strong . \n\n \n\nA wealthy global economy can surely only arise from a healthy\nworld .\n\n\nNations such as those of the G8 must do much more to make such an\nideal possible . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  A question of loyalty  \n\n \n\nThe view that some SAR officials are still clinging to what may\nloosely be referred to as a colonial mentality and not helping the Chief\nExecutive wholeheartedly has regrettably underlined the remarks of senior\nChinese leaders on Hong Kong in recent years . \n\n \n\nThis line of thought was clearly behind Vice-Premier Qian Qichen  ' s\ncomment one week ago that Tung Chee-hwa really had no one to help him when he\ntook up his task five years ago .\n\n\nWith the exception of Secretary for Justice Elsie Leung Oi-sie ,\n\" all the officials were civil servants who were employed by the\ngovernor\" , noted Mr Qian . \n\n \n\nYesterday the same theme was also apparent behind President\nJiang Zemin  ' s call on Hong Kong people to do a better job in adapting\nthemselves to the new Hong Kong after 1997 and become better masters of Hong\nKong and the motherland . \n\n \n\nCivil servants at all ranks , especially ranking officials ,\nshould \" conscientiously submit to and support the leadership of the\nChief Executive , work with one heart and strive to achieve fresh successes\"\n, said Mr Jiang . \n\n \n\nAllowing Mr Tung to form his own team to run the SAR was\nbelieved to be a major consideration behind the central Government  ' s\napproval of the ministerial system . \n\n \n\nSenior civil servants who have laboured to help Mr Tung run the\ngovernment and will be sidelined under the ministerial system will see Mr\nJiang and Mr Qian  ' s words as most unfair . \n\n \n\nAlthough the  Post  has endorsed ministerial\nappointments as an inevitable development of Hong Kong  ' s political system ,\nwe do not think it is right to blame the civil service for the Tung\nadministration  ' s inadequacies . \n\n \n\nFormer chief secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang , who warned that\nthe morale of the civil service was very low , was absolutely right yesterday\nin dismissing suggestions that civil servants might have been disloyal . \n\n \n\nA Chinese proverb says: whoever understands the times is a great\nman . Depending on the context , it can be used to refer positively to those\nwho seize the moment to make a great contribution , or negatively to those\nwho advance their careers by bending with the wind .\n\n\nBut history has shown that it is almost impossible to neatly\nclassify men of the moment under either one of the two categories . \n\n \n\nA major premise of the Basic Law is that the civil service will\nremain the backbone of the administration after the handover and its key\nmembers at the transfer of sovereignty will stay on to ensure a smooth\ntransition . \n\n \n\nFor senior civil servants , deciding how and when to uphold\n\" one country &rdquo; or \" two systems &rdquo; is a taxing\nproblem .\n\n\nNone of them should be improperly taken to task for conscientiously\nupholding the \" wrong &rdquo; notion at the \" wrong &rdquo; time .\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Courting trouble  \n\n \n\nThe administration of United States President George W. Bush is\nmaking a mockery of its supposed respect for international law through\nexpressing its disapproval of the International Criminal Court by vetoing a\nrenewal of the United Nations police force in Bosnia . \n\n \n\nThat the world  ' s most powerful nation should have resorted to\nfrustrating a peace mission in order to impose its will on others is a big\nshame . \n\n \n\nThe United States is concerned that its forces on missions\nabroad will be vulnerable to politically motivated charges .\n\n\nBut the constitution of the court has provided for elaborate\nsafeguards , many inserted at the insistence of US officials under former\npresident Bill Clinton , to prevent frivolous and trumped up charges being\nlaid against anyone . \n\n \n\nA total of 74 countries , including European democracies that\nare members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and whose forces take\npart in many peace-keeping missions around the world , have found the\nsafeguards adequate . \n\n \n\nAmericans have to realise that their country will lose the moral\nauthority to be the world  ' s policeman if they refuse to subject their\nnationals to the jurisdiction of a properly constituted court that aims to\ndeter war crimes . \n\n \n\nIt is thus disturbing that a bill asserting the United States'\nrights to use \" all means necessary &rdquo; to free any Americans\ndetained in the court  ' s prison is even making its way through Congress .\n\n\n \n\nShould the bill become law , the United States will lose all\ncredibility as a nation that stands for human rights .\n\n\nEven though it is not ready to embrace the court , the Bush\nadministration should at least stop its campaign to undermine it .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "4029ce65-e69c-4281-8e0a-e8e80e177675", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.895991+00:00"}

{"text": "The Quality of Life  \n\n\nWan Po-san  \n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\nHappiness has always been regarded as an important end of human\nactivities .\n\n\nDespite the lack of consensus on what happiness is and how it can be\nachieved , the starting point of achieving individual happiness or well-being\nshould undoubtedly be the satisfaction of primary human needs .\n\n\nFor example , general concern about the individual  ' s quality of life\nin developing countries ( where food and shelter are critical matters\nand very few basic human needs are satisfactorily met ) is normally\nfocused on the physical and quantitative aspects and guided by the dictum of\n\" the more , the better . &rdquo;\n\n\nIndividual and societal wellbeing are measured primarily by a variety\nof indicators of social conditions such as gross domestic product and its\ncomposition , household income , percentage of housing units with piped water\nand toilets inside , total and per capita consumption of electricity , life\nexpectancy , supply of physicians and trained health personnel , per capita\nsupply of calories and protein , illiteracy rate , etc . \n\n \n\nThis approach basically assumes that economic development can\nbring about social development and enhance people  ' s quality of life .\n\n\nIn other words , the quality of life becomes a function of the\nobjective conditions of society in which one lives .\n\n\nYet the obvious discrepancies between economic growth and social\nprogress experienced in the West in the 1960s have not only shaken the a\npriori assumption of the correlation between objective social conditions and\nsubjective quality of life , but also revealed the inadequacy of material\nwellbeing as the principal determinant of personal happiness . \n\n \n\nUnlike the developing countries , studies in the quality of life\nin modern and affluent societies are characterized by their emphasis on\nattitudinal measures .\n\n\nThe focus on measuring individual quality of life has shifted from\n\" being well-off &rdquo; to \" a sense of wellbeing &rdquo; .\n\n\nSocial scientists and policy-markers begin to recognize that people  ' s\nperceptions and evaluations of their life situations , however uninformed\nthey may be , are real to persons involved .\n\n\nPeople act on the basis of their perceptions and they should also be\nthe best judges of their own wellbeing . \n\n \n\nOver the past three decades , Hong Kong people have profited\nsignificantly form the territory  ' s miraculous modernization , urbanization\nand Westernization .\n\n\nThe breathtaking socioeconomic progress Hong Kong has undergone\nreveals a similar development trend in the West .\n\n\nAlong with the impressive gain in affluence is a multitude of\nemergent problems .\n\n\nFor example , while people are enjoying a longer life and\nexperiencing less infectious diseases , they suffer more from a variety of\nnoninfectious illnesses , especially those related to people  ' s\nself-destructive lifestyles .\n\n\nFamily structure and values are changing , and many of the elderly\nare psychologically and economically maladjusted .\n\n\nThe educational attainment of the population has been elevated to an\nunprecedented level , yet people are decrying the deteriorating academic and\nmoral standards of the younger generation .\n\n\nPeople are better off , but also have to worry more about personal\nsafety and public order .\n\n\nIn spite of technological advancement , our environment is\ndeteriorating dangerously .\n\n\nWhat is the impact of these worrisome developments on the quality of\nlife of Hong Kong people ?\n\n\nHow do they perceive and evaluate these changes ?\n\n\nObjective statistics are indispensable for understanding people  ' s\nwellbeing , and most of them can be obtained from the many reports published\nby the government and other public organizations . \n\n \n\nIn this chapter , after a brief presentation of the territory  ' s\nobjective social conditions and some comparisons with other places , I shall\nfocus primarily on people  ' s own account of their personal wellbeing which\nincludes their major life concerns , the evaluation of the living environment\n, personal life satisfaction and expectation .\n\n\nSubjective wellbeing contains two conceptual dimensions : ( 1\n) the positive aspect ( the extent to which one feels happy is\nsatisfied with his/her life ) &semi; and ( 2 ) the\nnegative aspect ( the extent to which one can avoid various miseries\n) .\n\n\nVariations among population groups on subjective wellbeing will be\nanalysed to gauge the distribution of sense of wellbeing in Hong Kong . \n\n\n\nGeneral Social Conditions \n\n \n\nHong Kong has become one of the world  ' s high-income economies .\n\n\nAccording to the World Bank , the majority of its socioeconomic\nperformance ratings rank among the world  ' s top quartile .\n\n\nIts overall economic performance is ranked second only to Singapore\nwithin the newly industrializing countries category by the World Economic\nForum and the International Centre for Management Development in 1991  ' s\nWorld Competitiveness Report .\n\n\nIndicators of the territory  ' s progress are legion .\n\n\nFor example , in accordance with the Engel  ' s Law , one of the most\nobvious life improvement indicators is the structure of private consumption .\n\n\nCompared to the past , the people of Hong Kong today spend less on\nfood , eat more outside , live more comfortably , enjoy more leisure\nactivities , travel overseas to spend a vacation , and demand more advanced\nand luxurious consumer items .\n\n\nMajor aspects of the territory  ' s performance and their comparisons\nwith some selected countries are presented in Table 1 .\n\n\nThe majority of these indicators pertain either to the proportion of\nthe population having or not having a specific quality ( e.g .\nliteracy ) , or to a standard of adequacy with regard to certain\nliving conditions ( e.g . daily calorie supply ) .  \n\n\nMajor Life Concerns \n\n \n\nAs a concept , \" the quality of life &rdquo; is by nature\nnormative and presupposes subjective judgement .\n\n\nThe specification of the major life concerns , which embody\nindividual aspirations and societal goals , is thus generally regarded as a\nstep towards a workable , albeit partial , definition of the quality of life .\n\n\n \n\nThe range of possible human concerns from personal to social\nmatters , is extremely broad .\n\n\nWhat is valuable in life may vary across cultures , over time , and\namong peoples .\n\n\nHowever , a study of life concerns in thirteen countries has\ndemonstrated the existence of an underlying , cross-cultural dimension: \n\n\n .. . the vast majority of people  ' s hopes and fears revolve\naround the complex of personal well-being , and this is rather simply and\ngenuinely defined : a decent standard of living &semi; opportunity for\nchildren &semi; technological advances &semi; good health &semi; a good job\n&semi; decent housing &semi; a happy home life &semi; better educational\nfacilities...  \n\n \n\nAs shown in Table 2 , Hong Kong people have a relatively broad\nconsensus on the meaning of a happy life .\n\n\nThey desire both nonmaterial satisfaction and material gratification .\n\n\nTheir conception of happiness is very personal and individualistic .\n\n\nGood health , being the bedrock of everyday life activities , has\nalways been the most cherished value .\n\n\nMoney comes second .\n\n\nNevertheless , people are not quite explicit about their\nmaterialistic orientation .\n\n\nVery few of them identify material enjoyment as the most important\ningredient of happiness .\n\n\nThe emphasis placed on certain Confucian values , such as filial\npiety and peace of mind , may reflect the lingering influence of traditional\nChinese culture .\n\n\nIt is interesting to note that , despite the centrality of the family\nin Chinese societies , the importance of love and marriage has always been\ngiven a relatively low significance .\n\n\nFindings in the past five years seem to indicate the declining\nimportance of health , love and marriage , and the growing significance of\nmoney and peace of mind , as the most important sources of happiness  .\n\n\nAlthough Hong Kong people are often praised for their   hard work  , the importance of career and work in a happy life\nis low .\n\n\nPeople are willing to donate for charity causes , but social services\nare definitely not regarded as important for personal wellbeing .  \n\n\nEvaluation of the Living Environment  \n\n\nPerception of Social Problems \n\n \n\nThe nature and magnitude of social problems have direct impact\nupon people  ' s wellbeing .\n\n\nIn previous social indicators surveys , respondents were asked to\nevaluate the degree of seriousness of different categories of social problems\nand to indicate the most serious social problem that should be solved\nimmediately .\n\n\nThe results of the 1990 survey are listed in Table 3 . \n\n \n\nThe findings indicate a relatively high public consciousness of\nsocial problems .\n\n\nFive problems were rated by over half of the respondents as serious\nor very serious .\n\n\nOnly three of them , viz. brain drain , social welfare , and\neducation , received noncommittal answers by over 10 per cent of the\nrespondents . \n\n \n\nAlthough Hong Kong has been described as a society of refugees\nwho are obsessed with economic gains , the continuous influx of Vietnamese\nrefugees is nevertheless received with unprecedented public resentment  .\n\n\nIn my survey , the perceived seriousness of the problem of Vietnamese\nboat people rises to the top .\n\n\nNot only nearly nine out of ten respondents considered it as a\nserious social problem , it was also regarded by the Royal Hong Kong Police\nForce as a great problem with which it has to cope . \n\n \n\nIn the past year , progress on the environmental front has been\nmade .\n\n\nFor instance , a low-surplus fuel policy for factories was announced\n, laws governing water pollution were extended to two additional areas ,\nbilateral agreements on environmental control were signed with Guangdong\nprovince and the city of Shenzhen , unleaded fuel and more \"\nenvironment-friendly &rdquo; products were introduced .\n\n\nDespite these advances , the problem of environment pollution still\noccupies second place on the list of perceived serious problems . \n\n \n\nIn view of the scheduled return of the territory to China , more\nand more people try to ease their anxiety by emigration .\n\n\nThe incessant outflow of people and capital should not only threaten\nthe economy and increase the propensity to migrate among those staying behind\n, but should also dampen the morale and confidence of those who do not want\nor are not qualified to emigrate .\n\n\nTherefore , it is not at all surprising to find the problem of\n\" brain drain &rdquo; being rated quite high in perceived seriousness\nby the respondents . \n\n \n\nThe problems of the elderly and social morality were considered\nby nearly half of the respondents as serious .\n\n\nIt is noteworthy that the problems with higher degree of perceived\nseriousness are mostly those affecting particular population groups (\ne.g . the Vietnamese , the youth and the elderly ) , those associated\nwith social order , and those comparatively less amenable to control or\nprevention .\n\n\nOn the contrary , problems with a lower degree of perceived\nseriousness are those public and social services ( e.g . education ,\nsocial welfare , medical services , transport , and housing ) for\nwhose provision the government is directly responsible .\n\n\nFurthermore , the closer a problem is related to the people  ' s daily\nlivelihood and immediate personal interests , the easier its seriousness\nwould be perceived . \n\n \n\nWhen asked to name the most serious social problem that should be\nsolved immediately , respondents also ranked the Vietnamese boat people first .\n\n\nHowever , apart from this problem , there is apparently a lack of\ncongruence between the degree of perceived seriousness of a problem and the\nurgency of its solution .\n\n\nThe best example is the problem of environmental pollution .\n\n\nAs a result of visible environmental deterioration , the active\ninvolvement of environmental protection organizations , the increasing\nattention given to it by the mass media , and growing government intervention\n, people should now be very conscious of the environmental problems .\n\n\nYet , surprisingly , although ranked second in terms of perceived\nseriousness , it was identified by merely 5.6 per cent of the respondents as\nthe social problem that should be solved immediately . \n\n \n\nPublic perceptions of social problems often change from time to\ntime .\n\n\nThe most common causes of these changes are shifts in values , the\nsolution of old problems , and the creation of new ones .\n\n\nComparisons of the 1986 , 1988 , and 1990 date reveal that the\nproblems of youth and public order are persistently seen by the majority of\nrespondents as serious social problems .\n\n\nStill , some changes have taken place .\n\n\nThe problems of the Vietnamese boat people , environmental problems ,\nand \" brain drain &rdquo; become \" new &rdquo; social problems\nresulting from an increasing public awareness , and there is a slight decline\nin the perceived seriousness of some \" old &rdquo; social problems\nrelated to the provision of social and public services . \n\n \n\nWith respect to the perceived problems facing Hong Kong in the\ncoming five years , the ordering of their perceived seriousness is similar to\nthat found in the past year .\n\n\nAccording to opinion polls conducted by City and New Territories\nAdministration ( CNTA ) in March 1990 , \" Hong Kong  ' s\nfuture &rdquo; still continues to top the list .\n\n\nFollowing it are \" economy-related , &rdquo; \"\ncrime-related , &rdquo; \" labour-related &rdquo; and \"\nhousing-related &rdquo; problems .  \n\n\nSatisfaction with Living Conditions \n\n \n\nPeople show ambivalent attitudes towards the general situation .\n\n\nOn the one hand , public confidence in the territory  ' s future seems\nto have improved gradually the June 4 in China .\n\n\nFor example , the value and volume of retail sales in supermarkets\nand department stores have gone up again .\n\n\nThe quarterly Survey Research Hongkong ( SRH )\nPolitical Confidence Indexes in 1990 were 88,88,90 and 93 respectively .\n\n\nMost people were of the opinion that Hong Kong was still the best\nplace in the world to live .\n\n\nYet , on the other hand , public worries about the deterioration of\nthe quality of life are growing .\n\n\nFaced with a double-digit inflation rate which is in fact the highest\nin a decade and which outpaces the rate of salary increase , people  ' s\nlivelihood ( especially among production and related workers )\nhave undoubtedly been affected .\n\n\nMany people say that their living standard is falling and that it\nwill get worse in the near future if the steep upward trend in the cost of\nliving is not reversed .\n\n\nPublic anxiety about and resentment at the deterioration of the\nquality of life have been vividly expressed in a number of unprecedented\nanti-inflation mass protests .\n\n\nThe largest of these protests was coorganized by 176 citizens groups\nin April 1990 . \n\n \n\nFurthermore , people are quite dissatisfied with a wide spectrum\nof the territory  ' s general social conditions .\n\n\nNone of the social conditions asked about in the 1990 survey was\nconsidered satisfactory by half of the respondents ( see Table 4\n) .\n\n\nPeople were more concerned with matters that affected them directly\nand personally ( e.g . transport , public orders , housing etc.\n) than those macrolevel or \" remote &rdquo; issues ( e.g .\npolitical and economic situation and social welfare ) .\n\n\nIn the past year , a number of economic problems , such as sluggish\neconomic growth , the heavy public expenditure commitments (\nespecially the &dollar;16.3 billion airport plan ) and high inflation\n, were commonly regarded as threatening people  ' s quality of life .\n\n\nNevertheless , people were still more satisfied with Hong Kong  ' s\neconomic conditions than with the conditions in the sociopolitical spheres .\n\n\n \n\nWidespread mistrust of the Chinese government , anxieties about\nthe impending transfer of sovereignty , and unease at the increasing\ninvolvement of China in local affairs together make the fast-changing\npolitical situation the least satisfactory and most uncertain social\ncondition in the public mind .\n\n\nLess than one-sixth of the respondents were satisfied with the\npolitical situation while nearly a quarter of them gave only noncommittal\nreplies . \n\n \n\nPublic order has always been a major public concern in urban\nsociety .\n\n\nIn view of the rapid increase in serious crimes ( e.g . armed\nrobbery was up 45 per cent in the first half-year of 1991 as compared to the\nsame period in 1990 ) , it is not at all surprising to find that\npublic order was seen by the respondents as the second most dissatisfying\nsocial condition .\n\n\nThe enormous pressures generated by high population density make\nproblems of transport and housing major sources of public discontent .\n\n\nEducation continues to take up the largest share of the government  ' s\ntotal expenditure , but only four out of ten of the respondents were\nsatisfied with it  .\n\n\nFinally , public satisfaction with recreation , employment ,\neconomic situation , education and medical services were all only slightly\nabove average .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f84a0a08-5ae0-4db8-896c-3ed279099519", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.899979+00:00"}

It is now widely acknowledged that Ridley\nScott  ' s  Blade Runner  (  1982/ 1992 ) initiated a whole tradition of\ncult movies later grouped under the label \" cyberpunk.\"  Blade\nRunner   ' s style draws its images from urban spaces all over the world ,\nincluding such Asian cities as Tokyo and Hong Kong .\n\n\nScience fiction film critics are less aware , however , that when\n anime  film director Mamoru Oshii was looking for a model of the\ncity of the future in a computerized world , he turned for his primary\ninspiration to the cityscape of Hong Kong .\n\n\nThrough his art designers , actual sports in the city of Hong Kong\nwere transformed into the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne of  Ghost in the Shell  ,\nfirst released in the United States in March 1996 . \n\n \n\nScience fiction has not fared well in Hong Kong (  wither in terms\nof production or consumption ) , nor is there a cyberpunk culture among Hong\nKong  ' s young computers users .\n\n\nSo the question arises: what elements in Hong Kong provided\ninspiration for this cinematic representation of a near-future city\ncharacterized by decadence , anarchy , and fantasy on the one hand , and a\nmistrusted , high-tech hyper-reality on the other ?\n\n\nTalking up this question , I will first suggest a reading of a\nshopping complex in Hong Kong that emphasizes its fragmentation ,\ndisjunctiveness , and emphemerality .\n\n\nLike  Blade Runner   ' s \" Ridleyville , &rdquo; this\nHong Kong shopping complex intertwines past and future , memory and desire .\n\n\nFinally , I will analyze the setting of  Ghost in the Shell \n, especially the parts that are clearly modeled on Hong Kong streets scenes\nand architecture .\n\n\nI hope to validate Antony King  ' s argument that colonial cities have\nthe best chance of establishing a cityscape of the future that embraces\nracial and cultural difference . \n\n \n\nBefore going any further , let me address the politics of\nrepresentation , especially in the visual media of cyberpunk art and film .\n\n\nFollowing the success of  Blade Runner  , such\ncyber-thrillers as  Johnny Mnemonic  (  1995 ) ,  Hackers  ( \n1995 ) ,  Lawnmower Man 2  (  1996 ) , and  Strange Days  ( \n1995 ) have also selectively used motifs of \" Asian &rdquo; design\nenvironments , together with their visual icons , to portray cultural\ndifference and to create visual pleasure from postmodern pastiche .\n\n\nAs in  Blade Runner  , the most popular model for artists'\nand filmmakers ' dark and sprawling cities of the suture is an Asian-dominated\nmetropolis .\n\n\nCyberpunk novels , including Gibson  ' s  Neuromancer  (  1984)\nand Stephenson  ' s  Snow Crash  (  1992 ) , likewise emphasize Asian\nculture and urban style , suggesting (  as John Christie has argued ) \"\nthe replacement of the hegemonic state apparatus by multinationals , its\ncultural pluralism &rdquo; (  173 ) .\n\n\nWhereas  Snow Crash   ' s \" Mr . Lee  ' s Greater Hong\nKong &rdquo; is set in cyberspace,  Neuromancer   ' s Night City , The\nSprawl , coffin hotel , and Ninsei are based on the Tokyo Bay area .\n\n\nIn his recent novel ,  Idoru  (  1996 ) , Gibson even presents\norganic buildings in a 21st-century Tokyo .\n\n\n(  In this case , there must also be some connection to Hong Kong as\nwell , since in his acknowledgment to a Japanese director , Gibson mentions\n\" Kowloon Walled City , &rdquo; which has \" continued to haunt\nhim &rdquo; (  n.pag. ) ever since the latter told him about it. )  \n\n \n\nFor sf illustrator Barclay Shaw , the merging of cyberspace with\nthe sleazy , neon-lit visual passion in  Neuromancer  closely\nresembles a chaotic Hong Kong street .\n\n\nCommissioned as cover art for the 1986 Phantasia Press edition of the\nnovel , the painting chooses some Chinese characters (  Presumably taken from\nHong Kong shop signs ) for the foreground , highlighting not only a sense of\nethnic and cultural confusion and hybridity but also a continuous process of\nthe destructions and reconstructions so characteristic of contemporary\ncityscapes .\n\n\nThis is certainly in line with the cyberpunk convention of \"\nthe run-down inner-city slum-cum-tent settlement , overcrowded , trashed and\ngraffiti-ridden &rdquo; (  Bonner 194 ) , reminding us at the same time of \nBlade Runner   ' s Ridleyville . \n\n \n\nAs Nigel Clark notes , \"  Neuromancer  and its\nsequels feature a series of hyper-aestheticized urban spaces: terrains in\nwhich vibrant new signifying surfaces are layered over the detritus of\nobsolescent forms &rdquo; (  121 ) .\n\n\nAs a city hustler who understands \" the dynamics of street\ndealing &rdquo; (   Neuromancer  11 ) , Case knows well \" that\nburgeoning technologies require outlaw zones , &rdquo; the kind of space\nprovided by Chiba City , a \" magnet for the Sprawl  ' s techno-criminal\nsubcultures &rdquo; and a places inhabited by Chinese experts in \"\nblack medicine , implants , nerve-splicing , and microbionics &rdquo; (  6 ) .\n\n\nLooking at Shaw  ' s cover art , one might assume that the dark alley\nto the right behind the drug store would be the sort of place where one of\nthese black market clinics might be found . \n\n \n\nWe also find visual icons relating to Chinese characters ,\nobviously within a \" Chinatown &rdquo; setting , in cyberpunk films such as\n Strange Days  .\n\n\nSet in Los Angeles a few days shy of the millennium , the sustains\nfilm noir tradition through dark and explosive scenes of riots and chaos .\n\n\nIn between these hybridized sites and battle zones on the streets ,\nChinatown  ' s glittering lanterns (  not the authentic kind with real\ncandlelight , of course ) , together with the profusion of shops and\ncommercial sign boards characteristic of a normal busy Hong Kong street ,\njuxtapose visual alternatives and establish a tone somewhere between\neroticism and dreariness .\n\n\nThis kind of design , which marks the unmistakable miscellaneity of a\nmetropolis , suggests a near future where centers and peripheries do not hold\nand where racial conflicts are at the point of explosion; it also provides an\nappropriate way to exhibit an \" inverted millennarianism &rdquo; ( \nJameson 53 ) .\n\n\nScenes from a kitchen in a Chinese restaurant depict violence and\nintrigues played out among individuals , while collective racial protests and\nriots are taking place in the streets .\n\n\nIt is curious that such \" Chinese &rdquo; vignettes have become a\nfavourite among recent Hollywood filmmakers .\n\n\nCompared to the front of the restaurant in  Strange Days  ,\nwhere decor and orderliness prevail , the kitchen is filmed as a clandestine\nnegative space signifying hiddenness and disorder .\n\n\nIn the restaurant kitchen , the flawed character Nero plays out his\ndrama of fighting back against corporate crimes , providing a contrast with\nthe public atrocities committed in front of millions of people during the New\nYear countdown celebration at the movie  ' s conclusion . \n\n \n\nIn  Strange Days  , \" Chinese &rdquo; spaces are\nrepresented as hidden within the context of the future urban setting .\n\n\nIs there any cultural or ideological significance in this-beyond the\nfact that a Chinese restaurant kitchen is an exotic spot ?\n\n\nDoes this added element of Chineseness (  contrasted with the\nexploding warfare among races and social classes in  Strange Days  )\nhelp to bring out the theme of the intertwining relations between social\nspace and media space ?\n\n\nFinally , since Chinatown settings are spaces famous for being\ninhabited by illegal immigrants , we will need to follow Homi Bhabha  ' s\ncritique of the \" metropolitan histories &rdquo; of the west , \"\nthe anomalous and discriminatory legal and cultural status assigned to\nmigrant , diasporic , and refugee populations &rdquo; who \" find\nthemselves on the frontiers between cultures and nations , often on the other\nside of the law &rdquo; (  Bhabha 175 ) . \n\n \n\n 2 .  We must be careful , however , in interpreting\nthe ways the Hong Kong cityscape is appropriated by cyberpunk literature and\nfilms; we must remember that Hollywood has had a long history of\nmisrepresenting Hong Kong , from white-male fantasies about oriental girls ( \n The World of Suzy Wong  (  1961 ) ) to exploitative soft-core\npornographic eroticism (  the  Emmanuelle  films ) .\n\n\nMore recently , a quick shot in the low-budget  Lawnmower Man 2\n shows a yellow rickshaw pulled by a Chinese man on the street of yet\nanother Los Angeles of the future .\n\n\nAn offensive example of \" non-equivalent sites of representation\n&rdquo; (  Bhabha 176 ) , this rickshaaw scene exemplifies a brutal seizure of\na cultural sign by the west , a way of \" evoking .. . savage colonial\nantecedents &rdquo; for the sake of presumed \" ideals of civility\n&rdquo; (  Bhabha 175).  1 \n\n\nWhether cyberpunk film directors are themselves free from this mire\nof distortion in their renderings of Hong Kong  ' s urban images is of course\nan important question to ask here . \n\n \n\n Blade Runner   ' s cultural references are indirect , yet\nI propose to compare the design of the film  ' s city setting with an actual\nspot in Hong Kong that may provide a paradigm for future global cities .\n\n\nThe incredibly detailed Los Angeles of 2019 in  Blade Runner\n creates a futuristic noir atmosphere by heavily borrowing from Asian\nmotifs , albeit vagus and general ones , in its design of city icons and\nsocial spaces .\n\n\nWith the artful \" retro-fitting &rdquo; and \" layering\n&rdquo; of the Japanese sushi bar , the gigantic media screen of the geisha\ngirl ad , and a Chinese bio-engineer who \" only does eyes , &rdquo; the\ncity , critics are quick to point out , looks like \" Chinatown in\nTomorrowland &rdquo; (  Hunter 225); the sleazy cinematography results in a\nhybrid and fractal combination of \" Hong KOng , New York , (  and ) Tokyo  ' s\nGinza district &rdquo; (  Sammon 101 ) .\n\n\nI would argue that considering Hong Kong as among the cinematic\nmodels for the future city may inspire not only a further look at Hong Kong\nat this present moment of political transition but also its potential for\ndeveloping into a \" forerunner of what the contemporary capitalist world city\nwill eventually become &rdquo; (  King 38 ) . \n\n \n\nPerhaps because of its recent reabsorption by China , Hong Kong\nhas drawn enormous interest from urban scholars and social critics .\n\n\nStruggling historically between traditional Chinese culture and\nBritish imperialism , and at this moment adjusting its full-fledged\ncapitalism in order to be embraced by socialism , Hong Kong  ' s postmodern\nidentity has been singled out as a unique case in the world , characterized\nby \" disappearance &rdquo; and \" hyphenation &rdquo; (  Abbas 1994;\n1996 ) or dealt with in terms of \" discourses in collision under the\nvolcano &rdquo; (  Cuthbert 1995 ) . \n\n \n\nAs someone who grew up in Hong Kong , I am particularly\nfascinated by the dazzling visuals of  Blade Runner   ' s Ridleyville\n, its seamless weaving together of the futuristic and the traditional , as\nwell as its paradoxical delighting of the eye through an emphasis on urban\nsqualor .\n\n\nOther aspects-hybrid architectural spaces , crowdedness , the\npolyglot or mishmash city-speak , the chaotic proliferation of neon\nbillboards above futuristic shopping arcades , the rain-soaked streets and\ndragon signs-invite me to conclude that this Los Angeles of 2019 can indeed\nbe read as \" Hong Kong on a bad day &rdquo; (  Salisbury 96; Doel and\nClarke 163 ) .\n\n\nThe questions remain to be asked: what illumination does  Blade\nRunner  offer us for envisioning the 21st century cityscape , and what\nrole will Hong Kong play in shaping our expectations of the city of the\nfuture ?\n\n\nThis film  ' s \" radical eclecticism or ad hoc-ism &rdquo; ( \nBruno 66 ) catches my eye and inspires me to think about the evolving scenes\nof my own city , freeing me from clich\u00e9s (  Hong Kong is a dynamic and\ninternational city with post-industrial and postmodernist characteristics ,\netc.)\n\n\nLet me go right to a specific Hong Kong space for a detailed\ndescription , to demonstrate the value of placing Ridleyville and Hong Kong\ntogether . \n\n \n\nThe place is located at the juncture of Happy Valley and Causeway\nBay around Russell Street and Sharp East Street , one of the most densely\npopulated areas of Hong Kong .\n\n\nPerhaps no other place can demonstrate so well the strange mix of\nglobal and local in truly cosmopolitan downtown development .\n\n\nThe space occupies half a square mile of streets , shops , flyovers ,\nand the recent addition of a mall , \" Times Square . &rdquo;\n\n\nIt is certainly an \" urban secret located at the intersection\nof postmodern and science fiction &rdquo; (  Bukatman 12 ) . \n\n \n\nApparently no parody was intended by naming the place after New\nYork;s Times Square , but the name does reflect and even reaffirm its own\nhistoricity and timeless - albeit the kind of schizophrenic temporality that\nFredric Jameson uses in his famous reading of the Bonaventure Hotel (  80-85 ) .\n\n\nThe complex itself , built on top of a busy metro station , stretches\nfrom several levels underground to skyscraper height , looking down on the\nadjacent , much  older buildings , \" indifference to\nits surrounding &rdquo; (  Abbas 1996 , 221 ) .\n\n\nFor city-planners , especially visitors , the awkward and abrupt\nsense of discrepancies on all levels is impossible to miss .\n\n\nThe complex was built on a former tram-depot skirted by an old-style\nstreet market and the quarters for lower echelon tram-company employees .\n\n\nThus an area once inhabited by comparatively low-income locals has\nbeen transformed by commercialism into a high-tech wonder , a bewildering\ncollage of signs and patterns with enough anarchic elements remaining (  a\nsmall part of the market and old style shops ) to create a send of pastiche .\n\n\nYet nothing unusual or uncanny is felt by the people who live there;\nand in general the logic of capitalism , in which \" shopping is an\naesthetic experience &rdquo; (  Webster 212 ) , works beautifully , since the\nspot has become (  with its advantages of proximity and diversity , its\navailability and variety of consumer goods ) one of the busiest and most\nprosperous places in Hong Kong .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "bf53a3d8-6cb9-487e-9498-48d6fc6fa55e", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.901656+00:00"}

{"text": "Call splits union council   \n\n\n By FAN CHEUK-WAN  \n\n \n\nTHE right-wing Hongkong and Kowloon Trades Union Council has split\nover a call from its president to abandon its anti-communist stance . \n\n \n\nMr Chan Yun-che said the 33,000-strong council had to dilute its\npolitical activities and spend more time on labour issues if it was to\nsurvive beyond 1997 . \n\n \n\nBut some council members have called for his resignation ,\naccusing him of breaching the council  ' s basic platform , which has\ntraditionally followed Taipei  ' s line . \n\n \n\nMr Chan hit back , saying it was the policy of Taiwan to seek\nreconciliation with the mainland . \n\n \n\n\" It is the right direction for the development of the\ncouncil to strengthen our work on labour issues .\n\n\nWe should reduce our role in politics , &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\nMr Lee Tak-ming , chairman of the Tung Wah Three Hospitals Workers  ' \nUnion , said it was more constructive to spend time on labour issues . \n\n\n \n\n\n China gets tough over reform bid   \n\n\n By FAN CHEUK-WAN  \n\n \n\nCHINA yesterday toughened its stance on Governor Mr Chris Patten  ' s\ncontroversial electoral reform proposals and his call for a clear position on\nthe handover arrangements . \n\n \n\nChinese Vice-premier Mr Qian Qichen yesterday said the job in\nHongkong now was to implement the agreements reached between China and\nBritain , and not to launch political reforms . \n\n \n\n\" There are only 49 months to go before China resumes\nsovereignty .\n\n\nThe interests of the mainland are closely related to those of\nHongkong and stability and prosperity will create conditions for Hongkong ,\n&rdquo; Mr Qian said , just days before the third round of the Sino-British\ntalks opens in Beijing on Friday . \n\n \n\nMr Qian , who is also Chinese Foreign Minister , made the remarks\nin a meeting with a delegation from the Hongkong West Kowloon All-Circles\nAssociation . \n\n \n\nA locally-based Chinese official , who asked not to be named ,\nwarned that it would be difficult for the third round of talks to yield\npositive results if the British side continued to insist on the Patten\npackage as its opening position on the negotiating table . \n\n \n\n\" The British claim that the Patten package is compatible\nwith the &lsquo; three accords &rsquo; has become the greatest obstacle in\nthe talks .\n\n\nSuch an important divergence over the basic principles has prevented\nthe talks from proceeding into discussion over details of the electoral\narrangements , &rdquo; the official said . \n\n \n\nHe further criticised Mr Patten  ' s public remarks during his\nrecent visit to the United States , and said they had damaged the atmosphere\nfor the talks . \n\n \n\n\" Chris Patten  ' s attempt to play the through-train card\nand the international card during his US visit was counter-productive to the\ntalks .\n\n\nHe just illustrated how insincere the British side was to the talks ,\n&rdquo; the official said . \n\n \n\nThe first two rounds of talks , held since April 22 , ended up\nwith both sides in deadlock over the understanding of the three accords\n-; the Joint Declaration , convergence with the Basic Law and previous\nunderstandings reached between the two Governments . \n\n \n\nRefuting accusations that Beijing was attempting to stall the\ntalks beyond the Legislative Council  ' s July recess , the official said the\ntalks were dragging on because the British side refused to genuinely comply\nwith the three accords . \n\n \n\nAnother major stumbling block in the talks was understood to be\nBritain  ' s demand that legislators elected in 1995 should stay in power\nthrough the handover . \n\n \n\nHowever , Mr Zhang Junsheng , vice-director of the local branch\nof the New China News Agency , yesterday stressed that the regulations had\nalready been laid down . \n\n \n\n\" Somebody has raised the question of the through train ,\nbut the Basic Law and the National People  ' s Congress resolution have clear\nstipulations on the criteria for the through-train arrangements , &rdquo; he\nsaid . \n\n \n\n\" The subject of the talks is very clear .\n\n\nAccording to the joint statement of the two Governments , the talks\nwill discuss the electoral arrangements in 1994/95 . &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n\n Newsmen seized on way to campus   \n\n\n By FAN CHEUK-WAN  \n\n \n\nTWO Hongkong journalists from Television Broadcasts Limited\n( TVB ) were taken away and interrogated by public security\nofficers when they tried to enter Beijing University on the night of June 3 .\n\n\n \n\nAttempts by other Hongkong journalists to cover the June 4\nanniversary activities on Beijing campuses were aborted as security personnel\nstepped up surveillance in the college district . \n\n \n\nThe car carrying senior reporter Lee Tak-sing and his cameraman\nwas intercepted by public security guards on their way to Beijing University\nin Haidian District . \n\n \n\nLee and his colleague were only released after they confessed to\nthe charge of illegal reporting . \n\n \n\nThey were also interrogated by public security officers for more\nthan two hours at a nearby hotel . \n\n \n\nJune Teng Wai-kwan , news controller of TVB , yesterday said the\natmosphere around the university campus in Beijing was very tense and it was\ndifficult for journalists to get into the university campus . \n\n \n\nTeng admitted it was not the first time TVB reporters had\nattempted to break the news blackout . \n\n \n\n\" From Hongkong  ' s point of view , the June 4 anniversary\nis worth a news item .\n\n\nWe continued to send cameramen to film the situation on Tiananmen\nSquare this morning , &rdquo; she said .  \n\n \n\n\n NPC &lsquo; unable to set criteria &rsquo;   \n\n\n By FAN CHEUK-WAN in Beijing  \n\n \n\nCHINA could not define the requirements for through-train\nlegislators before the 1995 elections because doing so might spark off more\ncontroversy and debate in the territory , according to Mr Xiang Chunyi ,\nVice-Chairman of the Law Committee of the National People  ' s Congress\n( NPC ) Standing Committee . \n\n \n\nMr Xiang , a former Basic Law drafter , said the British demand\nfor objective criteria was unreasonable and stressed that an NPC resolution\nhad already addressed the question . \n\n \n\n\" The through-train arrangements are a manifestation of the\nhandover of Hongkong  ' s sovereignty .\n\n\nThe NPC Standing Committee can't pre-empt the decisions of the SAR\nPreparatory Committee just to serve the needs of the 1995 Legco elections ,\n&rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\n\" It is technically infeasible to spell out a set of very\nspecific criteria before the 1995 elections to guarantee that particular\nindividuals must not be driven out of the through train in 1997 . \n\n \n\n\" There will be a two-year gap between 1995 and 1997 , so\nit will be inappropriate for the NPC Standing Committee to use the present\npolitical conditions to formulate the criteria for the through-train\narrangements in 1997 , &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\n\" There may be unprecedented changes between 1995 and 1997 .\n\n\nHow can the NPC Standing Committee formulate the criteria before the\n1995 Legco elections ? &rdquo; he asked . \n\n \n\nMr Xiang said that even if detailed criteria were required to\nclarify the through-train arrangements , these criteria must be formulated by\nthe SAR Preparatory Committee which would be set up in 1996 . \n\n \n\n\" If specific criteria for the through-train arrangements\nare set out before the formation of the SAR Preparatory Committee , then the\ncommittee will be reduced to a rubber-stamp , &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\n\" By doing so , we will show a lack of respect to the 50\nper cent Hongkong members sitting on the committee . \n\n \n\n\" Any specific criteria and detailed regulations governing\nthe through-train procedures should be set out by the SAR Preparatory\nCommittee , not the NPC Standing Committee . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nMr Xiang warned that formulation of a set of very detailed and\nspecific criteria would spark off greater controversy in Hongkong . \n\n \n\n\" If we set a criteria forbidding anybody taking part in\nsubversive organisations to sit on the through train , then the definition of\nsubversive organisations will spark off controversy and debate in Hongkong ,\n&rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\n\" People will query whether the definition of subversive\norganisations should stick to the definition in the Hongkong laws or Chinese\nlaws , &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\nBut the legal expert said people who had committed mistakes in\nthe past would be allowed to sit on the through train if they corrected their\nmistakes in 1997 .  \n\n \n\n\n China supports airport -; Lu   \n\n\n From FAN CHEUK-WAN in Beijing  \n\n \n\nCHINA  ' s top official in charge of Hongkong affairs , Mr Lu Ping\n, yesterday reaffirmed Beijing  ' s support for the controversial Chek Lap Kok\nairport project on condition that the British Government upheld the\nMemorandum of Understanding . \n\n \n\nAfter meeting the sub-group of Hongkong and Macau deputies to the\nNational People  ' s Congress , Mr Lu , director of the State Council  ' s\nHongkong and Macau Affairs Office , said the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group\n( JLG ) should hold meetings because a large number of issues\nhad not yet been resolved .  \n\n \n\nMr Lu  ' s remarks were understood to be Beijing  ' s latest\nreassurance to calm widespread speculation about an imminent total breakup in\nSino-British co-operation over Hongkong  ' s transitional arrangements . \n\n \n\nMr Lu declined to elaborate on when JLG talks could resume . \n\n \n\nGovernor Mr Chris Patten  ' s spokesman , Mr Mike Hanson ,\nyesterday urged China to name a date for further talks . \n\n \n\nOn the prospects for the long-stalled new airport project , Mr Lu\nsaid the Chinese Government still hoped it would be completed by 1997 . \n\n \n\n\" If the British side upholds the Memorandum of\nUnderstanding , the Chinese Government will support the construction of the\nnew airport , &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\nHowever , Mr Lu told the Hongkong and Macau NPC deputies at the\nclosed-door meeting that it was unlikely the Chek Lap Kok airport would be\ncompleted before 1997 . \n\n \n\nMeanwhile , the deputy director of the Hongkong branch of the New\nChina News Agency , Mr Zhang Junsheng , lambasted Mr Patten for sacrificing\nthe interests of Hongkong people in exchange for his own political career .\n\n\n \n\n\" If he tables the bill for electoral reform in the\nLegislative Council for discussion , it will be the third mistaken step he\nhas taken on the road of wrong-doings , &rdquo;

{"text": "Public Consultation and Planning   \n\n\n  Introduction   \n\n \n\nHong Kong  '  s existing planning system which operates under the\nTown Planning ordinance ( Cap. 131 ) enacted in 1939 , had no\nfundamental changes until the passage of the Town Planning ( Amendment\n) Ordinance 1991 .\n\n\nWith the significant social , economic and political changes in the\npast decades , a comprehensive review on the ordinance which guides the\noperation of the system is definitely needed .\n\n\nThe recent consultative document on the Comprehensive Review on the\nComprehensive Review of the Town Planning Ordinance provides a good\nopportunity for public consultation in the formulation of a more responsive\nplanning system to meet the needs of the changing environment .  \n\n\n  Principles and Objectives of Planning   \n\n \n\nBasically , the objective of planning is to optimize the use of\navailable land and resources to meet the needs of a community .\n\n\nMore exactly it is to enhance social and economic development and to\npromote environmental improvement .\n\n\nActors in the planning process normally include government officials ,\nprivate developers and citizens .\n\n\nAlthough the ultimate goal of creating a healthy living environment\nmay be agreeable by all parties concerned , their priorities and interests\nare significantly different .\n\n\nFor instance , government planners may wish to meet the shortfall of\nrequired public facilities in a district in a cost-effective way .\n\n\nPrivate developers are interested primarily in profit maximization in\nthe shortest time .\n\n\nThe public may their interests on neighbourhood improvement , and\nthose affected by the development may want to get the most from compensation\nand resettlement .\n\n\nIn pursuing their priorities and interests , private developers\nusually have the financial capacities to influence the government in the\nplanning process .\n\n\nAs for community residents , they have neither the financial means\nnor the professional expertise to influence the plan .\n\n\nHence , the consultation process must be made economical and easily\ncomprehensible to the general public . \n\n \n\nIn a democratic society , a planning system should not only\npromote public interest but also protect individual right .\n\n\nAn ideal planning system should be fair , flexible , predictable ,\nand affordable .\n\n\nSince the interest and objectives of various parties involved in the\nplanning and development processes are different and even conflicting\nsometimes , striking a balance among them is a very important issue . \n\n\n\n  Citizen Participation in Planning   \n\n \n\nIn the politics of planning , power is crucial in determining who\ngets what , and where , when and how to get them .\n\n\nUnlike private developers , the general public have little resources\nor power to influence planning and development .\n\n\nTheir interests and needs are often neglected. The introduction of\ncitizen participation is a way of ensuring that those affected development ,\nor conservation , on the other hand , will have a fair treatment in the\nprocess .\n\n\nMore specifically , to what extent citizen participation will\ninfluence the outcome of the planning process depends very much on the\ncontent , timing and means of participation .\n\n\nForm the citizen  ' s perspective , a genuine and meaningful\nparticipation should be substantive and should begin at an early stage of the\nplan preparation process .\n\n\nThe means should be simple and easily understood and the venue should\nbe convenient to all .\n\n\nIdeally , any affected person should have direct and continuing\nopportunities to participate in the planning process . \n\n \n\nAt present in Hong Kong , a development decision are often made\nby developers and government officials instead of affected residents ,\nbenefits usually accrue to the community at large or the former rather than\nthe latter .\n\n\nAs such , problems may arise in the implementation stage of a project\nwhen aggrieved residents demand excessive and unreasonable compensation which\nmay delay or inhibit the development .\n\n\nThis may adversely affect public interest and frustrate the\nopportunities or economic development and environmental improvement .\n\n\nHence , consultation at the early stage of planning will enhance\nbetter understanding and cooperation among residents , developers and\ngovernment officials and reduce conflicts in the implementation stage . \n\n\n\n  The Comprehensive Review of the Town Planning Ordinance\n  \n\n \n\nThe comprehensive review of the Town Planning Ordinance aims to\nupdate the planning system in meeting the changing social , economics , and\npolitical conditions in Hong Kong .\n\n\nIt covers many aspects such as the plan-making process , planning\napplications , development control , compensation and betterment , areas of\nspecial control , non-conforming existing uses and other issues .\n\n\nThe following sections focus on the public consultation aspect in the\nplan-making process and planning applications .  \n\n\n  -; Plan-making process   \n\n \n\nProblems of the existing plan-making process are   manifold  .\n\n\nInsufficient public participation is one of the main complaints .\n\n\nApart from the consultation with relevant district boards which is\nnot statutorily required under the existing Ordinance , there is no provision\nfor public consultation before a plan is prepared . \n\n \n\nIn the proposed new plan-making process , the introduction of\nplanning study in preparation of a draft plan is a step forward to\nincorporate public consultation at an early stage of the process .\n\n\nHowever , since the results of planning studies may involve come\ncomplicated issues , the suggested two-month public inspection and comments\nperiod is not flexible .\n\n\nIt is recommended to have a range between two to six months\nconsultation period depending on the complexity of the issues and subject to\nthe Planning Authority  ' s discretion .\n\n\nIn the proposed new process , it states that the planning Board\n( PB ) should take into account of the results and findings of\nplanning studies , public opinions received , and relevant government\npolicies in drawing up detailed planning proposals .\n\n\nHowever , no one know show public opinions , comments from public\nauthorities or local bodies are to be incorporated into the draft plan if the\nPB papers are not open to public .\n\n\nBesides , the proposed two-month period for comments is considered\ninadequate .\n\n\nSince any objections, comments or suggestions to the draft plan need\nmore detailed studies and preparation, three-month period for public\ninspection should be given . \n\n \n\nSurprisingly in the plan-making process , the territorial\ndevelopment strategies and sub-regional plans are excluded from any form of\npublic consultation .\n\n\nAs these plans may be similar to planning studies but in a macro\nscale , it would be useful for these two types of plans to have some form of\npublic consultation as well .\n\n\nOn the other hand , the draft and approved plans should be deposited\nfor public inspection in local district offices , and the Planning Department\nin addition to the Land Office .   \n\n\n -; Planning Applications   \n\n \n\nThe Review claims that the existing procedures for planning\napplications operate rather efficiently and flexibly .\n\n\nHowever , there are still &semi; some problems regarding public\ninvolvement and appeals in the process .\n\n\nThe proposed publication of planning applications for public\ninspection is a very good way of making certain adverse effects of a proposed\ndevelopment known to residents in the vicinity of the site .\n\n\nNonetheless , there is still a question regarding whether all\nplanning applications should be publishes .\n\n\nApart form the two listed options , i.e. publishing all planning\napplications or allowing PB the discretion power to decide which to be\npublished , there might be a third one which strikes the balance between the\ntwo .\n\n\nMore precisely , some specific guidelines for the types of planning\napplications which need no publications should be given .\n\n\nFor those non-published planning applications , they should be\nregistered and made available for public inspection .\n\n\nMoreover , applicants should be given reasons for refusal of the\nplanning applications so that they can decide whether to appeal or not . \n\n \n\nThe establishment of an independent planning Appeal Board\n( AB ) is a very sound move towards ensuring fairness in the\nplanning process .\n\n\nThe composition and operation of the AB is of paramount importance .\n\n\nThe appointments of members to the AB should reflect a wide spectrum\nof people with professional expertise but without vested interests .\n\n\nAs suggested , all the general principles of a hearing should be\nadopted . \n\n \n\nThe proposed new ordinance requires the prior consent or\nknowledge of the land owner a property before a planning application is made .\n\n\nIt might be useful to spell out the circumstances under which\nobtaining a written consent of the owner is necessary , while other\ncircumstances under which serving a notice on the owner would be accepted\nbecause it may not be feasible to obtain the consent of absentee of decreased\nowners .\n\n\nIt may be suffice to require the applicant to demonstrate a\nreasonable act in this regard .  \n\n \n\n\n Marine Insurance Claims - Onus of Proof   \n\n\n by Raymond Wong  \n\n \n\nIt is a general rule of law that the burden of proof is upon the\nparty making a claim or making an assertion to prove that their allegation is\ncorrect .\n\n\nThe word &lsquo; \" burden \" &rsquo; in these\ncircumstances means responsibility and it is the responsibility of the party\nmaking the claim to produce evidence which is sufficient to establish the\nvalidity of the claim . \n\n \n\nIn order to discharge the burden of proof , the Assured does not\nhave to exclude all possibilities as to how the particular damage has\noccurred but he is merely required to demonstrate that the balance of\nprobabilities is in favour of an accidental loss by perils insured against .\n\n\nSince it is his responsibility to prove his case , if a particular\nloss is equally likely to have been caused by a peril not covered by the\npolicy , then the Assured will have failed to discharge the burden of proof .\n\n\nTwo interesting cases demonstrating that it is the balance of\nprobabilities which much be looked to are the cases of  Munro Brice\n&ampersand; Co. v. Marten ( 1920 )  and  Cia. Maritima\nof Barcelona v. Wishart ( 1918 )  .\n\n\nIn the former case a vessel was lost during wartime .\n\n\nThere was no evidence brought forward to show that any particularly\nserious heavy weather had occurred at the relevant time in the area where the\nvessel was operating , but evidence was to hand that an enemy submarine had\nbeen active in such area .\n\n\nUnder these circumstances , the Assured failed to prove that the\nvessel had been lost by perils of the sea .\n\n\nIn the second case mentioned above , however , evidence was produced\nthat weather of some severity had occurred at the relevant time and the\nAssured succeeded in proving , on the balance of probabilities , that the\nvessel had been lost as a result of such heavy weather . \n\n \n\nVarious statements summarising the position regarding the burden\nof proof can be found in the case of the \"  POPI M  &rdquo;\n(  Rhesa Shipping Co. Ltd. v. Edmunds &ampersand; Fenton Insurance\nCo. Ltd -; 1985 )  .\n\n\nThe facts of this case were that a 26 year old vessel , the \"\nPOPI M &rdquo; was proceeding through the Mediterranean in calm seas when a\ngap suddenly developed in the shell plating in way of the engine room and ,\nas a result of the incursion of seawater , the vessel sank .\n\n\nIn his judgement , Lord Brandon made the following comments: \n &ldquo  '  The first matter is that the burden of proving , on a\nbalance of probabilities , that the ship was lost by perils of the sea , is\nand remains throughout on the shipowners .\n\n\nAlthough it is open to underwriters to suggest and seek to prove\nsome other cause of loss , against which the ship was not insured , there is\nno obligation on them to prove , even on a balance of probabilities , the\ntruth of their alternative case. &rdquo;  and  \" The\nshipowners failed to establish that the ship was seaworthy and they only put\nforward an extremely improbable cause of her loss .\n\n\nIn these circumstances , the Judge should have found that the true\ncause of the loss was in doubt , and that the shipowners had failed to\ndischarge the burden of proof which was on them . &rdquo;   \n\n \n\nLord Brandon also quoted in the course of his judgement the\nfollowing dictum of Scrutton L.J. in the case of  La Compania Martiartu\nv. The Corporation of The Royal Exchange Assurance ( 1923 )\n IKB 650 , as follows:   \" If there are circumstances\nsuggesting that another cause of the entry of sea water into the shop ... and\nan examination of all the evidence leaves the Court doubtful what is the real\ncause of the loss , the assured has failed to prove his case .\n\n\n&rdquo;   \n\n \n\nOnce the Assured has made out a prima facie case that the loss or\ndamage has occurred as a result of a peril insured against , the onus then\nshifts to the Underwriters to set up a counter-argument that the loss or\ndamage occurred as a result of a peril not insured against or to prove the\nprivity of the Assured , a breach of warranty or that the loss or damage\ncomes within the terms of an exceptions clause . \n\n \n\nThe onus of proof may vary according to the nature of a\nparticular case .\n\n\nFor instance , where the Assured is claiming for a loss by perils of\nthe sea , the onus is on him to prove that the loss was accidental .\n\n\nIt is clear from various legal judgements that , if the loss is\nequally likely to have been sustained as a result of perils of the sea and\nscuttling , the claim fails .\n\n\nIf the Assured , however , is claiming for a loss by fire the same\nprinciples do not apply , since fire is deemed to cover not only accidental\nfire but also fire deliberately caused .\n\n\nOnce the Assured has demonstrated therefore that the loss or damage\nhas arisen as a result of fire , whether or not deliberately caused .\n\n\nThe onus is then on Underwriters to prove that the Assured himself\nwas privy to the occurrence of the fire .\n\n\nThis is clear from the judgement  Slattary v. Mance ( 1962\n)  .  \n\n\n\n\n  L O F 1990 Who Pays ?  \n\n\n  The \" Enhanced Award &rdquo; &ampersand; \"\nSafety Net &rdquo; Liability   \n\n\n by Raymond T. C. Wong  \n\n \n\nThe International Convention on Salvage , 1989 was adopted on\n28th April 1989 like any other international convention , will take several\nyears for the required 15 states ratify it before the Convention enters into\nforce . \n\n \n\nThe major changes in the Convention have been incorporated into\nthe L 0 F 1990 .\n\n\nThis new Lloyd  ' s Standard Form of Salvage Agreement was published on\nthe 5th September 1990 .\n\n\nThe majority of the world  ' s salvage services will now be performed\nunder the L O F 1990 which includes Articles 13 and 14 of the 1989 Salvage\nConvention . \n\n \n\nThe Convention Article 13 sets out the criteria for fixing a\nsalvage remuneration which includes  \" the skill and efforts of\nthe salvors in preventing or minimizing damage to the environment &rdquo;\n .\n\n\nAn award made taking into account this factor is referred to as an\n&lsquo; enhanced &rsquo; award as if the tribunal was adding on a specific\nsum to what it would otherwise have awarded . \n\n \n\nThe special compensation provisions under the Convention Article\n14 is an adaptation of the &lsquo; safety net &rsquo; concept described as\n\" the exception to the principle of no cure - no pay &rdquo; initiated\nby Lloyd  ' s in L 0 F 1980 .\n\n\nUnder L 0 F 1980 , the &lsquo; safety net &rsquo; principle would\napply if all the following conditions were satisfied:\n\n\n1. The ship being salved must be a tanker laden or partly laden with\na cargo oil , fuel oil , heavy diesel oil or lubricating oil.\n\n\n2. The contractor , his servants or agents , endeavouring to prevent\nthe escape of oil while performing the salvage services , must not have been\nguilty of any negligence.\n\n\n3. The services must have been unsuccessful , only partially\nsuccessful , or brought to an end by the intervention of a third party . \n\n \n\nAt that time , two situations were envisaged . \n\n \n\nFirstly , a completely unsuccessful operation :\n\n\nThe Salvor became entitled to reasonably incurred expenses and a\nbonus , which would be at the Arbitrator  ' s discretion which would not exceed\n15% of the out-of-pocket expenses . \n\n \n\nSecondly , a partially successful operation :\n\n\nWhere the Salvor received a property award as against that part of\nthe property which he saved , but which award did not cover his expenses .\n\n\nIn these circumstances , the Salvor would be entitled to receive a\nfurther payment so that his total remuneration would cover his expenses plus\na bonus ( not exceeding 15 % of his expense ) . \n\n \n\nL 0 F 1990 which adopts the safety net rules updated in the 1989\nSalvage Convention , differs from L 0 F 1980 in that : -;\n\n\na. the safety net or special compensation applies not only to laden\noil tanker cases but also to any situation where the ship or cargo threatens\ndamage to the environment , and\n\n\nb. the increment will be up to 30% of expense , with a\nmaximum of 100%", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "76804f00-e4c6-4d71-bf6c-b15ed01f3b66", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.905506+00:00"}
{"text": "a ) Viscoamylography \n \n\nIt is used to measure the relatively viscosity of a system heated\nat constant rate ( 1.5&degree;C/min ) .\n\n\nSo it is frequently employed to study the gelatinizing property of\nstarch . \n \n\nWhen starch granules are added into cold water , water molecules\ncan freely penetrate into the starch granule .\n\n\nThe water absorption and the volume change of starch granule are\nreversible and the starch granule only swell slight .\n\n\nHeating the system  to\njust below the  starch gelatinization temperature does not\nbring any significant change .\n\n\nBut if the heating temperature is increased beyond the starch\ngelatinization temperature , irreversible changes occur .\n\n\nThis can be reflected in the viscoamylograph . \n \n\nAfter passing the gelatinization temperature of starch , the\nviscosity increases .\n\n\nThis is the result of \nstarch continual  taking up water and swelling substantially .\n\n\nAs the temperature increases , the starch granule becomes  distorted and releases the soluble\nstarch ( amylose ) .\n\n\nThe soluble starch together with the continual uptake of water by the\n remnants of starch granules cause an additional\nlarge increase in the viscosity of the system .\n\n\nThe starch granule will continue to   solubilize\n as the temperature increases until the whole granular structure  dissolves .\n\n\nThis would require a temperature of l20&degree;C .\n\n\nHowever , in food system , the temperature cannot exceed l00&degree;C\notherwise the system will boil .\n\n\nTherefore the amylograph is discontinued at 95&degree;C .\n\n\nThe swollen starch granules are then held for 1 hr at 95&degree;C .\n\n\nHolding the starch at a specific temperature doesn't increase its\nsolubility . \n \n\nA marked decrease in the viscosity of the system is observed at\nthe start of the  holding   period  .\n\n\nThis is due to the soluble starch fractions orientating themselves in\nthe direction that is the same as the stirring direction .\n\n\nThis is called shear thinning.The system is then cooled by using a\ncontrolled cooling ( 1.5&degree;C/min ) .\n\n\nAnd during this   period  , the viscosity rises\nagain .\n\n\nThis is called set back .\n\n\nThe phenomenon is due to the decrease in energy of the system  which then allows more hydrogen bonding , resulting in increased\nviscosity .  \n\n\n( c ) Cross-linking of starch \n \n\nIt is a method used to modify the functional properties of native\nstarch .\n\n\nCross-linking is the covalent bonding of two starch molecules to make\na larger molecule .\n\n\nIt can be achieved by forming a diester with phosphoric acid or\nforming  diether bonds with epichlorohydrin . \n \n\nHigh levels cross-linked starch has an increased gelatinization\ntemperature so that the modified starch  is not dissolved in\nautoclave or boiling system .\n\n\nThis type of starch finds its application in surgical gloves which\nhave to be sterilized at high temperature and if  it is\naccidently remained in patient body , it will be digested . \n \n\nLow levels cross-linked starch does not have sign change in the\ngelatinization temperature , but it shows significant chance in pasting\nproperty .\n\n\nUpon gelatinization the starch granule swells less and is less\nsoluble .\n\n\nTherefore it has a pasting viscosity lower than the parent starch .\n\n\nOne advantage of this modified starch is that it is not susceptible\nto shearing thinning .\n\n\n This is because the starch granule   solubilizes  less , it shears less .\n\n\nTherefore it can still maintain a high viscosity after pumping and\nstirring .\n\n\n\n \n\nLow levels cross-linked starch is useful to produce a  viscous system in acid medium e.g. thickening of cherry pie filling .\n\n\nThe acidity of cherry can hydrolyse &alpha;1-4 glucosidic linkages of\nstarch molecules and thus results in thinning of pie filling .\n\n\nBut if the starch granule has sufficient cross-linking , the problem\ncan be solved .\n\n\nThis starch granule has restricted swelling upon gelatinization , and\nas the acid hydrolyses the bonds , the viscosity increases instead of\ndecreasing . \n \n\nCross-linked starch can also be used to control retrogradation .\n\n\nAs retrogradation usually exhibits in starch fragments that are small\nand more mobile .\n\n\nThis prevents watering and opaqueness of gel . \n \n\nIt can also be used to maintain gel consistence when the gel is\nfrozen and thawed .\n\n\nThis is done by holding the starch chains fixed in space so that upon\nthawing , they can interact with each other to retrograde .\n\n\nWater can again hydrate the starch chains .  \n\n\n3 \n \n\n  Corn  grain is mainly used in wet milling\nindustry and corn distiller process for beverage production . \n \n\nIn wet milling industry , the primary products are starch and\nnutritive sweetener .\n\n\nAbout 65-70% of total corn used in wet milling can be\nconverted to primary products .\n\n\nThe remainings are by-products which are further processed to animal\nfeed .\n\n\nIn the wet milling process , many by-products  are produced , for example steep liquor from\nthe steeping stage; corn germ meal from the germ which has its oil extracted\nand the bran .\n\n\nMixing of the above by-products in composition can produce the corn\ngluten feed which is a palatable animal feed .\n\n\nThe gluten separated from the starch can also be sold as corn gluten\nmeal which is also an animal feed .\n\n\nEven the corn oil is a valuable by product .\n\n\nThe  corn starch produced from the wet milling\n is mainly used for nutritive sweetener\nproduction and for papermaking . \n \n\nAbout 90% of starch used in papermaking comes from corn .\n\n\nThe use of corn starch can improve the properties of the paper and\nreduce the production cost .\n\n\nHowever , modification of the starch is  usually need before it can be an additive for paper making .\n\n \n\nThe biggest corn starch user is the sweetener production industry .\n\n\nCorn starch can be used for making sweeteners such as anhydrose\ndextrose , high  fructose corn\nsyrup .\n\n\nThe latter is more important since it has a sweetness approach to\nthat of sucrose and so it is frequently used to substitute sucrose in food .\n\n\nThis is because sucrose is more expensive .\n\n\nDextrose has been widely used in beverage , \n confectionery  ,  baking industries while\nHFCS is widely used in soft drinks and baking industries . \n \n\nThe production of sweeteners is enzymatic fermentation  process in which &alpha;-amylase and\nglucoamylase are used .\n\n\nThe former  converts the starch to small\nsaccharides and the latter act on the saccharides to produce dextrose .\n\n\n42% HFCS is produced by partial isomerisation of the purified\ndextrose to fructose with immobilized \nglucose  isomerase .\n\n\nThe use of chromatographic separation techniques \nproduce a 90% fructose products which can then be blended with  42% HFCS to form 55%\nHFCS . \n \n\nCorn can also be used for beverage production and again  by products such as dried distiller  ' s grains , dried\ndistiller  ' s grains with solubles , dried distiller  ' s solubles are widely\nused as animal feed . \n \n\nThe high   availability  , abundance\nand low cost have make corn to be attractive commodity .\n\n\nFrom the above it can be seen that corn can be turned to many   valuable  products through the wet milling process .\n\n\nIn China , domestically produced maize is mostly used directly as\nfood or as animal feeds ( This is  an uneconomical\nuse of corn . ) In order to increase the value of domestic maize\nproduction , the Government of China should establish some more wet milling\nplants and buy the corn crop from the farmer .\n\n\nIn this way the government can change the low value corn grain to\nmany more useful and high value products  and byproducts .\n\n\nNowadays there is a great demand for corn starch for manufacturing of\nnutritive sweeteners , also corn oil ( by products of wet corn milling\n) is being recognised to be   beneficial  to\nhealth and more and more people use it .\n\n\nThere will be great profit if wet milling industry is developed in\nChina .  \n\n\n1 \n \n\nWheat protein is the essential   ingredient\n in wheat flour which is the only one cereal flour that can be used for\nbreadmaking .\n\n\nWhat make wheat flour unique is the present of storage proteins\ncalled gluten .\n\n\nGluten has important functional properties in bread . \n \n\nBread is a yeast leavened products and it must contains at least\n4  minimum ingredients: flour ( wheat\n) , salt , yeast , water .\n\n\nThe production of bread is a fermentation process .\n\n\nA dough that  is able to  retain gas and rise is necessary for breadmaking .\n\n\nThe first contribution made by wheat gluten is the participation in\nthe dough structure .\n\n\nIt forms the major structural  component by\nproviding a matrix for the strings of starch granules .\n\n\nIt also affects the rheological property of the dough by contributing\nto the cohesiveness and elasticity of the dough . \n \n\nDuring the fermentation of a developed dough .\n\n\nThe  yeast utilize the carbohydrate\nsubstrate to produce alcohol and carbon dioxide .\n\n\nThe latter is responsible for raising the dough .\n\n\n Therefore the trapping of\ncarbon dioxide is very important otherwise the dough will not   rise .\n\n\n The cohesiveness contributed\nby gluten makes the dough able to   incorporate \nair into itself .\n\n\nThe presence of these small air cells is important since yeast cannot\nproduce air cells .\n\n\nDuring fermentation CO2 is first produced in the aqueous phase of the\ndough .\n\n\nOnce the aqueous phase has been saturated with CO2 , CO2 will diffuse\ninto the air  cells and cause them to\nexpand .\n\n\nIt is the elastic property offered by gluten \nthat allows the expansion of gas cells .\n\n\nAlso during the baking process the presence of gluten allow the large\nexpansion of gas cells .\n\n\nAnother characteristic that  gluten contribute to the leavening system is its structure .\n\n\nThe special structure of gluten slows down the diffusion of CO2 and\ntherefore effectively retaining the gas . \n \n\nIn a dough which is well mixed , gluten is completely hydrated so\nthat it  carries considerable amount of water .\n\n\nDuring baking , water is needed for gelatinization of starch and at\nthe same time protein is denatured to release the water molecules that allow\ngelatinization of starch possible . \n \n\nThe quality of bread is mainly depend on  the\nsize and amount of gas cells that present in the bread , and the   gluten  has sign contribution to this .  \n\n\n \n\nDavid Hawkes said that one of his translation principle is to\ntranslate everything -; even puns .\n\n\nActually , in translating , it is impossible to translate everything\nas there are cultural differences arise in the source text and the target\ntext .\n\n\nTherefore , many unique features of Chinese culture such as those\nappeared in  is impossible to be translated into\n English . \n \n\nIn fact , David Hawkes adopts a rather free translation method\nin translating  .\n\n\nFirstly , he does not translate the book  ' s name   into \"  The Dream of Red\nChamber  \" that the term \" \" red &rdquo; \"\nis associated with certain connotative meaning as \"  &rdquo; , that is a cultural barrier that  the\nforeigners  by reading the translated version will fail to\nunderstand .\n\n\nTherefore , he translate the book  ' s name into \"  The\nStory of the Stone  \" as the whole story of  is talking about \"  &rdquo; who is born\nfrom stone .\n\n\nSo the story about \"  &rdquo; is\nactually about \" The Stone &rdquo; . \n \n\nMoreover , David Hawkes  ' s translation method , unlike &lsquo;\nhis principle &rsquo; as said before , is not to translate everything . \n \n\nIt is obvious that in the translated version of \" The\nStory of the Stone &rdquo; the first few paragraphs of the original \"\n &rdquo; is omitted .\n\n\nAlso , he is selectively translated the poems . \n \n\nFurthermore , when he translate the parts related to &lsquo;\npuns &rsquo; , he cannot keep the Chinese pun in the translation but he  makes some changes and translated the &lsquo; puns &rsquo; in\nanother ways . \n \n\nAlso , when David Hawkes translates the concepts about Taoism ,\nhe cannot translate  all the meanings in the terms .\n\n\nFor example , in translating  '   &rsquo; ,\nit is a term used in Taoism , David Hawkes fails  to\ntranslate  all this concept  to English but\nonly translate it directly from the lexical meaning due to cultural\ndifferences .\n\n\n\n \n\nAll in all , David Hawkes  ' s principle about to translate\neverything and even puns is not  so correct since it is\nimpossible to translate everything .\n\n\nTranslation is actually a craft in converting one language into\nanother .\n\n\nBut there are losses eg .\n\n\nmeanings in the process of translating One hundred percentage\nequivalent translation is not possible . \n \n\nAlso , the puns in Chinese may be or may not be  kept in translating into English as there are differences in two\nlanguages and cultures . \n \n\nTherefore , David Hawkes &rsquo; principle is not  so correct at all .  \n\n\nPART II 1 \n \n\nThere are many linguistic theories of culture .\n\n\nIt is because due to the cultural differences .\n\n\nThe use of languages by different people of different cultures are\nnot the same .\n\n\nTherefore , linguistic theories of culture is useful in analysing\nthe differences or similarity of different culture .\n\n\nBy using , linguistic , we can analyse the problems in a more\nscientific and logical way .\n\n\n\n \n\nFirstly , from linguistic theories of culture , we can analyse\nthe way people saying \" Yes &rdquo; or \" No &rdquo; .\n\n\nFor example , Japanese is a race  who tend\nto always \" Yes &rdquo; all the time .\n\n\nIf we don't know linguistic , we don't know when do they  mean \" &lsquo; agree &rsquo; \" or \" &lsquo;\ndisagree &rsquo; \" . \n \n\nSecondly ,  except verbal communication ,\nthere are non-verbal communication exist such as body gesture .\n\n\nIf we study linguistic we can know the way people express themselves\n,  as different races have different ways of body\ngestures  for non-verbal communication purposes . \n \n\nAlso , the loudness of  the voices ,\nthe times of repeating a statement is a special way of expressing something\nin different cultures .\n\n\nFor example ,  people\nin  Philippines tend to repeat their statement when\nconfirming their point of view .\n\n\n\n \n\nIn Hong Kong , people tend to say &lsquo; We  ' ll have tea later\n&rsquo; ,  &lsquo; Visit you later &rsquo; or &lsquo; Call you\nlater and so on to  show the friendly manner , actually\n people saying it without an intention to bring an\n action .\n\n\nThere is a story  due to of the culture\nmisunderstanding .\n\n\n When a  boy talked to his friend ,\nwho is a foreigner about the Chinese food and he arbitrarily said that if\nthat foreigner came to his home tomorrow , he  would\nprepare a Chinese meal for him .\n\n\nThe boy would not expect the foreigner come to his home , however ,\nthe next day , the foreigner came to the boy  ' s home and wanted to taste the\nChinese food .\n\n\nBut actually , the boy did not prepare any food at all .\n\n\nThere is the problem about cultural differences . \n \n\nMoreover , because of the different cultures , the \"\nWesterners &rdquo; and Chinese have a different perception about colour .\n\n\nFor example , in Chinese society , white colour is associated with\nthe unfortunate thing such as someone die .\n\n\nBut for the foreigners , white colour is associated \n with the  celebration such as wedding .\n\n\nAlso , red colour is associated with &lsquo; lucky &rsquo; or\ncelebration in Chinese culture , but in Western society , red colour is\nassociated with danger . \n \n\nTherefore , the study of linguistic theories of culture can help\nus to analyse the differences of culture in different society and help us to\navoid the misunderstanding arise from it .  \n\n\n2 ( a ) \n \n\nThe questions or concerns does  Huckleberry Finn  raise\nabout values in Western Society are individualism , alienation and   opportunism  . \n \n\nHuckleberry Finn has its own style of speech demonstrates his\nuniqueness and individualism , which is quite different from \nother people in the book .\n\n\nHis speech does not follow the standard English but &lsquo; create\n&rsquo;  a new way of speech a kind of American  dialect ( Southwestern vernacular ) .\n\n\nHe does not follow the  ' standard &rsquo; grammatical rules and it\nseems that his speech  has errors and not correct .\n\n\nFor example ,  in the beginning of the book (\n1st paragraph ) Huck said that ,  \"  You don't know about me without you have read\na book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer but that ain't no matter.\"\n \n \n\nMoreover , Huck  ' s behaviour as considered by many people is\nacceptable though he help the slave , Jim to escape from the family but it is\nHuck  ' s wise to take every opportunity to escape from civilization , from his\nfather  and the family which restricts him , but he is not\njust a indulgence person . \n \n\nHuck is regarded as a bad boy , but he save a slave , Jim from\nthe Old South ( before the Civil War ) down the   Mississippi  River seems to be a brave behaviour and considered\n&lsquo; good &rsquo; by the people .\n\n\nThough he and Jim  ' s life is a way of alienation from the\ncivilization , it also can be considered escape from the traditional rules\nand restriction and so find a way to freedom , to set themselves free . \n \n\nThe values in Huckleberry finn is quite unique to the Western\nsociety .\n\n\nBut in Chinese society , the values questions or  concerns are quite different .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM",

{"text": "Patient selection for assisted reproductive technology treatments\n  \n\n\nLP Cheung \n\n \n\n\nAssisted reproductive technology refers to procedures in which the\noocyte in handled or manipulated in vitro before replacement , either as an\noccyte or an embryo .\n\n\nBecause of rapid advances in this area , infertile couples may seek\ndirect referral for assisted reproductive treatments , instead of trying\nsimpler measures such as ovulation induction and intrauterine insemination .\n\n\nIt is important to establish whether these conventional infertility\ntreatments are appropriate , as such treatments are generally safer , less\nstressful , and more affordable .\n\n\nOn the other hand , subjecting infertile couples to unnecessary delay\nby offering inappropriate treatments - for example , ovulation induction for\ntubal infertility or intrauterine insemination for severe male-factor\ninfertility - would reduce the overall chance of success because of the\nage-related decline in female fecundity .\n\n\nThe choice of infertility treatments thus depends on a balance of\nfactors: the chance of pregnancy without treatment; the chance with simpler\nand safer , but less successful , infertility treatments; or the chance with\nthe more complex and costly , but more effective , assisted reproductive\ntreatments .\n\n\nThe factors that should be taken into consideration include the age of\nthe woman , the duration of infertility , the causes of infertility , the\navailability and cost of alternative treatments , and - most importantly -\nthe acceptability .    \n\n\nIntroduction  \n\n \n\nInfertility is defined as the failure by a couple of reproductive\nage to conceive after 12 months or more of regular coitus without using\ncontraception .\n\n\nThis definition is based on epidemiological studies , which have\nshown that 80% of couples in the general population normally conceive by that\nstage.  1 \n\n\nIt is estimated that 15% of couples living in developed countries are\ninfertile.  2 \n\n\nThere has been no major change in prevalence , but there has been an\nincrease in demand for treatment during the past decade because of the\nperception that effective assisted reproductive technology (  ART ) treatments\nare now available .\n\n\nTable 1 summaries the ART procedures that are most commonly practiced\nthroughout the world . \n\n \n\nAlthough ART was initially developed for patients with tubal\ninfertility , it is currently used for almost all kinds of infertility\nproblem , because its success rates are expected to be higher than those of\nconventional treatments .\n\n\nHowever , ART treatment also has disadvantages .\n\n\nIt involves greater expense , and potentially serious complications\nsuch as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and multiple pregnancies can occur .\n\n\nThere are also fears that drugs that induce ovulation may increase\nthe risk of ovarian cancer .\n\n\nInfertility treatment should therefore be individualised to avoid\nsubjecting couples to unnecessary use of ART treatments , or to inappropriate\ndelay because of undertreatment . \n\n \n\nTable 2 summaries common infertility treatments and their\nindications .\n\n\nIt should be emphasised that the choice of treatment is also\ninfluenced by other factors such as the age of the woman and the duration of\ninfertility .\n\n\nThe age of the female partner is one of the most important factors\ndetermining spontaneous fertility .\n\n\nIt is also a major factor in determining the success of any form of\ninfertility treatment .\n\n\nUsing the database established in 1991 by the Human Fertilisation and\nEmbryology Authority , Templeton \u00e8t al  3  analysed 36961 in vitro\nfertilisation (  IVF ) cycles that  were performed in the United\nKingdom .\n\n\nThey found a marked decline in pregnancy rates in women older than 35\nyears , and no pregnancies were recorded for women older than 45 years except\nin the oocyte donation programme .\n\n\nIt seems that although young patients in their 20s may have the\noption to use safer but only moderately effective treatments , by their late\n30s , treatment should be more aggressive .\n\n\nOn the other hand , aggressive infertility treatments should be\ndiscouraged in women in their 40s because of poor success rates .\n\n\nThe duration of infertility is another major factor determining the\nlikelihood of spontaneous pregnancy in untreated infertile couples.  4\n\n\n\nAs most infertility is not absolute but includes some degree of\nsubfertility , many couples have a background chance of conceiving naturally .\n\n\nThe longer the duration of infertility , however , the less likely is\nthat probability .\n\n\nThis predictive value is of particular importance to couples with\nunexplained infertility . \n\n \n\nEven in normal couples with proven fertility , the average\nmonthly conception rate is only 20% to 25% .\n\n\nThe peak rate is 33% in the first month of trying , falling rapidly\nto approximately 5% each month thereafter.  5 \n\n\nThe expectation of any infertility treatment must be judged against\nthis finding .\n\n\nInfertility treatment should be offered when the chance of conceiving\nnaturally is unacceptable low (  <1% to  2% per cycle or 20% to 30% after  2\nyears).  6 \n\n\nSimple treatment such as ovulation induction and intrauterine\ninsemination (  IUI ) are suitably only in certain situations (  Table 2 ) and\nwill be expected to achieve a pregnancy rate of approximately 10% per cycle .\n\n\nAssisted reproductive techniques are suitable for almost all kinds of\ninfertility problems , but treatment with even the most advanced ART is\nexpected to achieve only a 25% to 30% success rate per cycle .\n\n\nTreatment may need to be repeated several times before success is\nachieved .\n\n\nAs a constant rise in the cumulative pregnancy rtes during the six\ninitial  cycles has been demonstrated,  7  in general\nit is worth pursuing treatment for up to six cycles .\n\n\nBefore an infertile couple is recruited into an IVF programme , they\nshould be warned that both the cumulative pregnancy and live-birth rates\ndecline with the age of the woman .\n\n\nTan el al  8  have reported that the cumulative pregnancy\nand live-birth rates after five IVF cycles were 54% and 45% , respectively ,\nat age <35  years , 38.7% and 28.9% at 35 to 39  years , and 20.2% and 14.4%\nat age = 40 years.  8 \n\n\nThe stress , time away from work , cost , and complications of the\ntreatment should also be emphasized .\n\n\nAlternatives such as adoption or childlessness should be discussed .\n\n\nPatient acceptability is very important , but it is often neglected\nduring the infertility evaluation .   \n\n\nInfertility evaluation  \n\n \n\nThe Figure summaries the investigation and management of an\ninfertile couple .\n\n\nThe cornerstone of any infertility evaluation relies on the\nassessment of coital difficulties , cervical or immunological factors ,\novulation , tuboperitoneal pathology , and semen quality .   \n\n\n\nAssessment of coital , cervical , or immunological problems \n \n\n \n\nCoital difficulties should be recognised if a detailed sexual\nhistory is obtained .\n\n\nCervical or immunological factors need to be considered when results\nfrom post-coital tests are repeatedly negative .\n\n\nFurther investigations to detect antibodies against components of\nsperm and then necessary .\n\n\nThe use of systemic corticosteriods to treat men who have anti-sperm\nantibodies is not recommended , as the evidence of benefit is conflicting and\nthere are potentially serious side effects such as aseptic hip necrosis. \n9 \n\n\nTreatment using IUI with or without ovarian stimulation can bypass\nthe problem of sperm progression through cervical mucus .\n\n\nHowever , ART should be considered after repeated failure of IUI\ntreatments .    \n\n\nAssessment of ovulation   \n\n \n\nA detailed menstrual , medical , and drug history should be\nobtained .\n\n\nWomen with normal regular menstrual cycles of 28 to 30 days are\nusually ovulating .\n\n\nSimple assessments such as a biphasic pattern of the basal body\ntemperature chart or an appropriate rise of the midluteal serum progesterone\nconcentration provide presumptive evidence of ovulation . \n\n \n\nIn patients with suspected anovulation , the following tests\nshould be performed: measurement of the levels of follicle-stimulating\nhormone (  FSH ) , Iuteinizing hormone (  LH ) , oestradiol , and testosterone ( \nall samples having been taken at early follicular phase before day 5 of the\ncycle ) , as well as the prolactin level and the thyroid function test .\n\n\nAfter excluding any secondary medical or endocrine causes ,\nanovulatory problems are usually categorized under four conditions.  10\n   \n\n\nHyperprolactinaemic anovulation  \n\n \n\nPatients with hypergonadotrophic anovulation may present with\ngalactorrhoea .\n\n\nIf a serum prolactin concentration confirms hyperproclactinaemia ,\ninvestigations to exclude a pituitary adenoma and hypothyroidism are\nperformed .\n\n\nThese tests comprise computerized tomo-graphy or magnetic resonance\nimaging of the pituitary gland and the thyroid function test .\n\n\nTaking a detailed drug history is also important , because the use of\nsome commonly prescribed drugs such as phenothiazine , haloperidol ,\nmetoclopramide , cimetidine , and methyldopa is associated with\nhyperprolactinaemia .\n\n\nThe first-line treatment is the use of dopamine agonists such as\nbromocriptine .\n\n\nThese drugs can be combined with anti-oestrogens , if ovulation does\nnot occur despite normalised prolactin concentrations.  11   \n\n\n\nHypogonadotrophic anovulation  \n\n \n\nThe causes of hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism are often functional\nand transient .\n\n\nAnovulation may be stress-induced or related to weight loss or\nexcessive exercise .\n\n\nAn organic cause should be excluded , however , particularly if there\nare neurological symptoms .\n\n\nThe evidence for hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism is a low level of FSH\n, LH , and oestrogen , and the absence of withdrawal bleeding after a\nprogesterone challenging test .\n\n\nThe primary aim of treatment should be to correct the underlying\ncause .\n\n\nIt has been shown that spontaneous ovulation will return in\nunderweight women after correction of their nutritional deficiency.  12\n\n\n\nAnti-oestrogens are not effective in this condition , owing to the\nnon-functioning hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis .\n\n\nOvulation induction should be achieved by using either a pulsatile\ngonadotrophin-releasing hormone (  GnRH ) or gonadotrophins in a specialist\ninfertility centre , in which the woman is intensively monitoring during\novulation induction .   \n\n\nHypergonadotrophic anovulation  \n\n \n\nHypergonadotrophic anovulation implies ovarian resistance or\nfailure and is diagnosed when plasma concentrations of FSH are higher than 20\nIU/L from repeated measurements .\n\n\nIf the patient is younger than 40 years , this condition should be\nfurther investigated and treated as a premature menopause .\n\n\nThe only effective practical treatment for hypergondotrophic\nanovulation is oocyte donation .   \n\n\nNormogonadotrophic anovulation  \n\n \n\nPatients with normogonadotrophic anovulation have normal FSH\nconcentrations , but LH concentrations may be elevated .\n\n\nThey are not hypo-oestrogenic and will bleed in response to a\nprogesterone withdrawal test .\n\n\nThe majority of these women have polycystic ovaries.  13 \n\n\nThis condition should be suspected of the woman is obese and hirsute\n, or if there is hyperandro-genaemia or an elevated LH to FSH ratio.  13\n Polycystic ovaries can be diagnosed using ultrasonography . \n\n \n\nApart weight loss in obese normogonado-trophic anovulation\npatients,  14  the first-line treatment is the use of\nanti-oestrogens such as colmifene (  clo-miphene ) citrate .\n\n\nThe starting dose of clomifene is 50mg/d for 5 days , from day 2 to\nday 6 of each cycle .\n\n\nThe dosage can be increased in monthly increments up 200mg/d .\n\n\nEarly referral to specialist infertility centers should be considered\nif patients are still anovulatory at the maximum dosage (  clomifene\nresistance ) or if there is failure to conceive after 12 cycles of successful\ntreatment with confirmation of ovulation (  clomifene failure ) .\n\n\nThe alternatives for patients with clomifene resistance polycystic\novarian disease are either medical induction of ovulation with pulsatile GnRH\nor gonadotrophins , or surgical treatment with ovarian wedge resection or\nlaparoscopic ovarian drilling .\n\n\nMedical treatments provide a good cumulative pregnancy rate , but\nthey increase the risk of multiple pregnancies and ovarian hyperstimulation.\n 10 \n\n\nThe spontaneous ovulation rate after surgical treatment is reported\nto be 60% to 80%,  15,16  but the efficacy in terms of pregnancy and\nthe ovarian damage associated with the procedure has yet to be evaluated .\n 17     \n\n\nAssessment and treatment of tuboperitoneal disease   \n\n \n\nTubal damage and pelvic adhesions may result from pelvic\ninflammatory disease , or may be secondary to endometriosis or previous lower\nabdominal or pelvic surgery .\n\n\nThere is still debate regarding the appropriate time for testing\ntubal patency .\n\n\nEarly investigation for tuboperitoneal pathology should be undertaken\nwhen there is a suspicious history or the presence of symptoms such as\ndysmenorrhoea or dyspareunia .\n\n\nHowever , in low-risk patients , the common practice is to delay a\ntest of tubal patency until there have been up to six to 12 ovulatory cycles .\n\n\nThis approach has been challenged , however , as pelvic infection or\nendometriosis can be completely silent .\n\n\nSerological tests for  Chlamydia trachomatis  infection have\nbeen suggested as a simple screening method for unsuspected previous\ninflection , which would indicates likely tubal damage.  18 \n\n\nEarly laparoscopy is then indicated in seropositive women.  19\n \n\n \n\nMethods used to assess tubal patency include laparoscopy with\nchromotubation , or hysterosalpingo-graphy .\n\n\nThe latter technique may be used as a screening test for tubal\npatency in low-risk patients .\n\n\nHowever , laparoscopy with chromotubation should be the preferred\nmethod of investigation , particularly when there is a strong suspicion of\nperitoneal disease .\n\n\nLaparoscopy may also be necessary when there is a hysterosalpinogram\nshowing suspected false-positive results due to tubal spasm or during\nplanning for infertility surgery . \n\n \n\nThe two choices for the treatment of tubal infertility are tubal\nsurgery or IVF .\n\n\nIn general , pregnancy rates after tubal surgery are not as good as\nthose achieved by IVF .\n\n\nThe overall 2-year cumulative pregnancy rate after tubal surgery is\nonly 20%,  20  which can now be expected in a single cycle of IVF\ntreatment .\n\n\nTubal surgery may still be appropriate in carefully selected cases ,\nbecause different types of tubal surgery have different prognoses .\n\n\nSurgery may be offered in cases of mild pelvic adhesions , proximal\ntubal obstruction , or mild distal tubal disease , although the eventual\nchance of pregnancy after 2 years is not much more than 50%.  20 \n\n\nHence , if a pregnancy has not occurred within 12 months (  at most\n24 months ) of tubal surgery , IVF should be offered . \n\n \n\nOwing to the poor prognosis of tubal surgery , IVF should be the\nfirst-line treatment for significant pelvic adhesions or moderate-to-severe\ndistal tubal disease .\n\n\nEarly referral for IVF is also necessary for women of advanced age\nor when coexisting problems such as male-factor infertility are present .\n  \n\n\nEndometriosis-associated infertility  \n\n \n\nEndometriosis , even of a minor degree , is associated with\nmarked subfertility.  6 \n\n\nMedical treatment of endometriosis has no proven benefit in\ninfertility.  21,22 \n\n\nOn the contrary , the chance of pregnancy is delayed by the duration\nof medical treatment .\n\n\nSurgical ablation of minimal-to-mind endometriosis has been shown to\nimprove fertility in subfertile women,  23  so this should be\nconsidered at the time of a diagnostic laparoscopy .\n\n\nOvulation induction by using IUI should be offered to patients with\nminimal-to-mild endometriosis if the duration of infertility is more than 3\nyears , as studies have shown that ovualtion induction with IUI is more\neffective than either no treatment or IUI alone.  24  \n\n \n\nThere is no evidence that medical treatment of\nmoderate-to-severe endometriosis either alone or as an adjunct to surgery\nimproves fertility.  21,22 \n\n\nSurgical treatment of moderate-to-severe endometriosis has been\nshown to improve fertility , but a full explanation of the high surgical risk\nshould be given.  22,25 \n\n\nIn vitro fertilization should also be offered as an alternative to\nor following unsuccessful surgery.  9     \n\n\nSemen quality and the treatment of male-factor infertility \n \n\n \n\nTable 3 lists the criteria of the World Health Organization ( \nWHO ) for normal semen characteristics.  26 \n\n\nIt has been estimated that less than 10% of male-factor infertility\nis amenable to conventional medical or surgical treatments .\n\n\nReferral for IUI or ART procedures should be considered if there are\ntwo abnormal semen samples that have been taken at least 3 months apart. \n26  \n\n \n\nIn patients with borderline semen abnormality , sperm\npreparation for IUI may correct the abnormality , but a minimal of 10 million\nmotile sperm per whole sample is still required .\n\n\nFor a severe semen-factor (  sperm concentration\n&less-than;10 million  spermatozoa per milliliter;  or &less-than;20% motility; or  \n&less-than;20% normal forms ) or when there is  history of fertilisation failure , IVF\nand intracytoplasmic sperm injection (  ICSI ) should be the primary treatment\noption.  27 \n\n\nWith the  introduction of ICSI , which requires only a\nsingle sperm to be injected per oocyte , it is now possible to use epididymal\nor testicular sperm even when there are no sperm in the ejaculate .\n\n\nEpididymal sperm can be obtained by performing microsurgical\nepididymal sperm aspiration in men with non-obstructive azoospermia .\n\n\nIt is thus worthwhile referring affected couples to specialist\ninfertility centres for urological assessment and , if necessary , to perform\nsperm recovery and ICSI .\n\n\nHowever , prior to offering any treatment to these couples ,\nparticular consideration should be given to the relevant genetic issues .\n\n\nIncreasing evidence has suggested a genetic linkage to reproductive\nfailure in 10% to 30% of men with severe oligoasthenoteratospermia.  28\n\n\n\nAccordingly , these patients should be counseled about the\npossibility of transmitting sex chromosomal aberrations or fertility problems\nto their offspring before they are recruited into the ICSI programmes. \n22,29   \n\n\nUnexplained infertility  \n\n \n\nIn 20% of couples presenting with infertility , a detailed\nhistory and examination followed by complete investigation will fail to\nelicit any clear explanation for the couple  ' s problem .\n\n\nThe main factors determining the chance of conceiving naturally are\nthe duration of infertility , the woman  ' s age and the previous pregnancy\nhistory.  4,30 \n\n\nAs the spontaneous conception rate only starts to significantly\ndecrease after 3 years of trying,  30  conservative management until\nthen could be considered , taking into account the woman  ' s age.  9 \n\n\nThere is no evidence of any benefit from clomifene treatment, \n31  and assisted conception should wait , except when the female partner\nis in her late 30s .\n\n\nAfter more than 3 years of infertility , the chances of natural\nconception ate negligible.  30 \n\n\nOvulation induction with IUI is a simple and moderately effective\ntreatment,  32  and in general it is worth pursuing for up to six\ncycles of treatment , before considering ART .\n\n\nThe advantage of this approach is that the risks associated with ART\nare avoided , particularly those relating to oocyte retrieval .\n\n\nBoth gamete intrafallopian transfer and IVF are effective ART\ntreatments in couples with unexplained infertility; both methods have similar\nefficacies.  33 \n\n\nIn centers where IVF is the preferred method , because of the\nadditional information it provides on fertilisation , which may be defective\nfor couples with unexplained infertility .\n\n\nFurthermore , performing IVF avoids the anesthetic and operative\nrisks of laparoscopy.  9    Conclusion  \n\n \n\nThe main indications for assisted people reproductive procedures\ninclude tubal disease , endometriosis , male infertility , and prolonged\nunexplained infertility .\n\n\nAssisted reproductive technology treatments are offered when the\nchance of conceiving by other means is unacceptable low or the women  ' s age\nleaves insufficient time for other treatments .\n\n\nThe major factor adversely affecting the success of ART is advanced\nfemale age , so early referral to specialist infertility centres should be\nconsidered , especially for women older than 35 years .\n\n\nOn the other hand , aggressive ART treatment should be discouraged\nin women in their 40s , as the chance of success is often unrealistic except\nin oocyte donation programmes .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "cd633cc0-6ac1-46b2-8449-cb92cf79be39", "added":

{"text": "Educational psychologist hits out at cash shortage  \n\n\n\n Polly Hui  \n\n \n\nLack of funding for training and demanding job requirements have\nled to a serious shortage of educational psychologists , according to a\nveteran practitioner in the field . \n\n \n\nIn 1990 , the Education Commission projected that 86 educational\npsychologists would be needed within the following eight years .\n\n\nHowever , Dr Lam Sui-fong , associate professor of the Department of\nPsychology at the University of Hong Kong , said there were only about 50\nworking for schools and the Education Department . \n\n \n\nIn last year  ' s Policy Address , Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa\nannounced that school-based educational psychologist services would be\nintroduced to 200 primary schools in the next six years .\n\n\nBut Dr Lam , who also heads the two-year master  ' s programme on\neducational psychology , criticised the Government for not providing enough\nfunds to meet that target . \n\n \n\nSince 1981 , HKU has been the only local provider of training .\n\n\nBut at present , the programme has funding for just 10 students to\nenrol every two years .\n\n\nDr Lam said she had approached both the Education Department and the\nUniversity Grants Committee for more resources , to no avail .\n\n\nHKU will increase the number to 15 for next year by charging students\n&dollar;50,000 in fees - &dollar;10,000 more than now .\n\n\n\" But only 45 educational psychologists will emerge by the end\nof 2008 .\n\n\nThe number is too small for primary schools , not to mention the\nsecondary and special needs sectors , &rdquo; Dr Lam said . \n\n \n\nRuth Lau Wing-mun , who oversees the team of educational\npsychologists in the Education Department , said the manpower shortage could\nbe tackled by recruiting those with overseas qualifications .\n\n\n\" If other local tertiary institutes find the need is expanding\n, they can also open relevant programmes , &rdquo; she said . \n\n \n\nHowever , tough employment requirements deter psychology\ngraduates from the field .\n\n\nTo be an educational psychologist , candidates must complete a first\ndegree in psychology , a master  ' s degree in educational psychology and at\nleast four years ' teaching experience .\n\n\nBut on graduating , they receive a starting salary of &dollar;25,000\na month , less than a teacher with equivalent work experience . \n\n \n\nPromotion to higher grades requires a postgraduate certificate in\neducation and six years ' working experience in education . \n\n \n\nThe requirements were considered \" very unreasonable\n&rdquo; by the Hong Kong Psychological Society  ' s Sub-Committee on the\nEmployment Structure for Educational Psychologists , said Dr Lam , who headed\nthe group until last year . \n\n \n\n\" Teachers are unlikely to be prepared to quit their stable\njobs , pay for their studies and then receive a lower salary , &rdquo; she\nsaid . \n\n \n\nThe sub-committee wants a review of the employment structure .\n\n\nThe Government has since relaxed the requirement for four years'\nteaching experience for lower-grade educational psychologists , but only as\nan interim measure . \n\n \n\nIn the last reply to Dr Lam  ' s series of letters to the Education\nDepartment last year , she was told that \" the review . . . is a\ntedious exercise involving various policy bureaux and the Standing Commission\non Civil Service Salaries and Conditions of Service\" .\n\n\nShe has had no further response . \n\n \n\nTso Kai-lok , vice-chairman of the Education Convergence , said\nthat a review of the role of educational psychologists was needed .\n\n\nMany schools were ignorant of how they could help students learn , he\nsaid .\n\n\nSome used them as social workers , resulting in a waste of resources .\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Women less likely to be promoted: study ` Glass ceiling ' in\ncareer development caused by pressure on female teachers to balance jobs and\nfamily life   \n\n\n Polly Hui  \n\n \n\nEducation reforms are taking their toll on women teachers more\nthan men because of the pressures they face in juggling longer working hours\nand family life , experts on education and gender studies claim . \n\n \n\nStatistics compiled by the Education Department show that\nalthough there are more women than men in the teaching profession , women are\nstill less likely to be promoted to higher levels . \n\n \n\nThe figures reveal that 63.5 per cent of secondary school\nteachers on assistant master grade last year were women .\n\n\nHowever , women on senior graduate master grade accounted for 41.4\nper cent of the total .\n\n\nJust 30 per cent of school principals were women . \n\n \n\nIn the primary sector , the percentages of female teachers on\nassistant master and primary school master grades were 66.5 and 61.6 per cent\nrespectively last year .\n\n\nBut they become a minority at the principal level , holding 47.1 per\ncent of headships .\n\n\nThe latter , though , is an improvement on figures from 1995 , when\njust 25 per cent of primary principals were women . \n\n \n\nMany teachers must now shoulder extra duties and work longer\nhours as competition between schools for students and resources intensifies ,\nsome academics on educational administration assert .\n\n\nIn a society where females have greater responsibility for raising\ntheir children , many women teachers find it hard to cope with their dual\nroles . \n\n \n\nSome educators attribute the glass ceiling in women teachers'\ncareer development to school heads ' doubts about their female staff  ' s\ncommitment to their work .\n\n\nOthers said many women chose not to assume senior posts in order to\nspend more time with their children . \n\n \n\nDr Anita Chan Kit-wa , a post-doctoral fellow at the Centre of\nAsian Studies at the University of Hong Kong who has undertaken research on\ngender and education , said that the education reforms had changed the work\nculture in schools to one where women - particularly those who were married\nwith children - were not favoured . \n\n \n\nMarket principles had been introduced to the school sector and\nallocation of resources were more performance-based than before , said Dr\nChan .\n\n\n\" Schools are more keen to deliver student-centred and\nparent-centred services in order to stay competitive .\n\n\nMany women teachers are under enormous pressure to achieve a balance\nbetween their career and family life .\n\n\nBut their plight is rarely looked into by the Government , &rdquo;\nshe said . \n\n \n\nThe problem was particularly acute in new schools , said Dr Chan .\n\n\nTo boost their student intakes , some schools ask teachers to stay on\nafter school to provide child-care services .\n\n\nTeacher performance charts , detailing class academic results , all\nadd to the pressure . \n\n \n\nDr Dora Choi Po-king , associate professor of educational\nadministration and policy at Chinese University of Hong Kong , said gender\ndistribution across teaching ranks was likely to increase as schools gained\nmore control of their management and budgets . \n\n \n\n\" With the decentralisation of budgeting , senior teachers\nwill be expected to handle more administrative duties such as drafting\nproposals for the Quality Education Fund .\n\n\nMale teachers are generally more ambitious and they won't mind the\nextra amount of paperwork as long as they can progress in their career .\n\n\nBut many women teachers would prefer to stay at a post where they can\nfocus on nurturing students , &rdquo; she said . \n\n \n\nDr Ng Ho-ming , deputy director of the Centre of Educational\nLeadership at HKU , said that some principals tended to promote male staff\nbecause they believed the latter were more committed to their careers .\n\n\nThey were also worried that women teachers had to have maternity\nleave and days off if their children were sick , he added . \n\n \n\nHowever , Lisa Yip Sau-wah , principal of Shatin Tsung Tsin\nSecondary School , said the trend reflected the traditional family role\nplayed by Chinese women rather than sex discrimination .\n\n\nMany married female teachers declined promotion because they wanted\nto spend more time with their young children , she said . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Two faces of Professor Chang  \n\n \n\n Heads of universities should remember they have to be\naccountable to the public   \n\n \n\n YUEN CHAN  \n\n \n\nVIEWPOINT \n\n \n\n I  N the film version of Umberto Eco  ' s novel \nThe Name of the Rose  , Sean Connery plays a renaissance man trapped in\nthe Dark Ages .\n\n\nA scholar-monk-detective who employs reason and wisdom against the\nforces of paranoia , prejudice , superstition and fear in the search for\ntruth . \n\n \n\nA look at Professor Chang Hsin-kang  ' s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 gives the\nimpression of a modern renaissance man .\n\n\nAn engineer educated in Taiwan and the United States .\n\n\nA globe-trotting academic immersed in the Chinese classic yet versed\nin Western culture .\n\n\nA scientist with a passion for the arts - eloquent in English and\nPutonghua , functional in Cantonese .\n\n\nOn top of all that , he  ' s president of the City University , the\nCultural and Heritage Commission chairman , a PCCW director even . \n\n \n\nWhen you see the man in person , he exucdes the air of a scholar\nand a gentleman .\n\n\nUntil he faces the media scrum that is .\n\n\nWhen confronted with eager journalists at the beginning of last week\n, Mr Chang appeared bewildered , timid and reticent .\n\n\nI witnessed both manifestations of the Chang persona last week at a\nseminar on the Culture of World Cities . \n\n \n\nProfessor Chang appeared uncomfortable when reporters pressed him\non when exactly there  ' d be a decision on Li Shaomin .\n\n\nHowever , once he took to the podium , he relaxed visibly .\n\n\nIf anyone was living proof that flashbulbs can render a person \"\ntemporarily brain-dead\" , he was it , he joked . \n\n \n\nThinking the congenial atmosphere inside the lecture theatre make\nhim more accessible , I approached Professor Chang during the tea-break .\n\n\nI didn't want to grill him , but merely get some comment (  however\nnon-committal ) in English .\n\n\nI stood right next to him and made my request in a political and\nnon-threatening way .\n\n\nSo , it came as a shock when he looked at me , then looked past me\nand then just walked away .\n\n\nThis was not what I expected from the president of a university .\n\n\nPerhaps he was still suffering from post-flashbulb stress disorder .\n\n\n \n\nEventually , I did manage to elicit a response during a\nquestion-and-answer session after the speakers had finished their\npresentations .\n\n\nI had been particularly impressed with a presentation by Professor Yu\nQiuyu , the acclaimed mainland writer , who stressed the importance of\noriginal thought and a vibrant intellectual life to the culture of a world\ncity . \n\n \n\nWhat , I asked Professor Chang , was the importance of academic\nfreedom and academic courage in maintaining and encouraging intellectual life ?\n\n\n \n\nIt was good to hear his ringing endorsement of the importance of\nacademic freedom , freedom of expression and of investigation .\n\n\nWhat was interesting though , was Professor Chang  ' s warning against\nthe abuse and politicisation of academic freedom . \n\n \n\nAt that moment he struck me as a renaissance man trapped in a\npost-modern society .\n\n \n\nA society where public figures are asked to account for and\nexplain their reasoning and actions , where the political implications of\ndecisions in the public sphere are discussed and analysed . \n\n \n\nGone are the days when the heads of academic institutions could\nadminister scholarly fiefdoms without regard to the world outside the ivory\ntowers . \n\n \n\nThe fact is that in a modem , democratic society the machinations\nof public institutions are bound to be scrutinised .\n\n\nFor better or worse , presidents of universities will fare better if\nthey have political and media savvy , and that doesn't just mean being able\nto please the establishment .\n\n\nJust think of what happened to the former vice-chancellor Cheng\nYiu-chung during the Robert Chung controversy . \n\n \n\nProfessor Chang  ' s recommendation not to discipline Li Shaomin\nwas both sensible and wise .\n\n\nHis comments after announcing the decision were measured and\nreasonable .\n\n\nIf he had been clearer about the principles on which the case would\nbe considered from the outset , both he and the university would have won far\ngreater respect . \n\n \n\nA university should be at the cutting edge if free-thinking , a\ncentre for academic endeavour without fear or favour .\n\n\nAbove all , a university should be a home for those who seek truth\nand dare to question accepted truths . \n\n \n\n  Yuen Chan  is a radio reporter for the\nEnglish-language service of RTHK  \n\n \n\nsoapboxhk@hotmail.com \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Lest we forget  \n\n \n\n A museum display on the Story of Hong Kong is worth the\nprice if admission , but there are holes in this history   \n\n \n\n YUEN CHAN  \n\n \n\nVIEWPOINT \n\n \n\n F  IRST , the good news .\n\n\nAt last , this aspiring world city has something approaching a\nworld-class museum .\n\n\nThe &dollar;10 I shelled out for an afternoon at the Hong Kong\nMuseum of History was &dollar;10 well spent . \n\n \n\nThe Story of Hong Kong Exhibition is beautifully presented .\n\n\nIt aims to tell that story by placing Hong Kong in its geographical\n, ecological , historical and cultural perspective .\n\n\nIt does so with varying degrees of success . \n\n \n\nThe museum has been , I believe , unfairly criticised for\nputting too much emphasis on the prehistory and early origins of Hong Kong .\n\n\nLiving in a city of concrete , steel and glass , it  ' s easy to\nforget we  ' re part of the landscape of southern China .\n\n\nThe happy and excited faces of the children who ran around this\nsection of the exhibition asking questions attests to its popularity . \n\n \n\nI was also moved by the number of senior citizens at the museum\n, transfixed as they saw their collective memories reflected back at them .\n\n\nThe most heartening thing was to hear the conversations: the\nreminiscences of shared experiences and the communication between one\ngeneration and another .\n\n\nIt was particularly poignant to witness elderly visitors recalling\nhardships and struggles in the section on Hong Kong under Japanese occupation\n- three years and eight months that left an indelible mark on the territory\nand the lives of those who lived through it . \n\n \n\nIt  ' s no surprise that the recent rewriting of history in a\nJapanese textbook by a right-wing group in Japan has created such anger and\nresentment from people in Hong Kong , the mainland and the Koreas . \n\n \n\nThe Central Government has argued , quite rightly , that history\nshould not whitewashed or obliterated .\n\n\nIn facing the present and the future we have to come to terms with\nhow we got here .\n\n\nAnd that applies across the board . \n\n \n\nSo the bad news about the Story of Hong Kong is the stories it\nleaves out .\n\n\nThe regulation of the 1967 riots to a mere mention and the failure\nto do even that much for the pro-democracy movement of 1989 are a travesty .\n\n\n \n\nOnly at the end of the exhibition , during a show of a long\nmontage of film and video footage with music do we see images of the unrest\nof the 1960s under the title of \" Stormy Days\" .\n\n\nThen , under a section titled \" Blood if Thicker than Water\" ,\nwe get a glimpse of 1989 .\n\n\nIt begins with the commemoration of Hu Yaobang  ' s death and quickly\ngives way to shots of what I first thought was the concept held at the\nracecourse to support the pro-democracy movement on the mainland , but was in\nfact the racecourse fundraiser for blood relief . \n\n \n\nAlthough frustratingly fleeting , these images offered those who\nremember these events a moment for reflection . But without any commentary or\nvoiceover to place them n any context , it would be hard for anyone without\nprior knowledge to make any sense of what they saw . \n\n \n\nThe people of Hong Kong have been told to put down the baggage\nof history and move forward .\n\n\nBut when is the remembering of history a burden and when is it\nsanctioned , as in the case of the Sino-Japanese war ? \n\n \n\nYes , the history of Hong Kong since World War II , or even\nsince the Opium War , is short compared with the hisroty of human habitation\nin this part of the world .\n\n\nBut it has witnessed momentous events that shaped and continued to\nsharp our lives today .\n\n\nDespite a century of British colonisation , our destiny has always\nbeen bound with that of our compatriots on the mainland .\n\n\nSo where are the stories of the impact of the Cultural Revolution ,\nof the care packages sent across the border , the corpses washed ashore\nduring times of famine ? \n\n \n\nThe historian Eric Hobsbawm wrote: \" The destruction of\nthe past , or rather of the social mechanisms that link one  ' s contemporary\nexperience to that of earlier generations , is one of the most characteristic\nand eerie phenomena of the late 20th century . &rdquo;\n\n\nHe says that the job of a historian is to remember what other forget .\n\n\n \n\nA tall order indeed , but a vitally important one .\n\n\nThe custodians of our past hold the keys to our future , and history\nhas proved that we forget at our peril . \n\n \n\n  Yuen Chan  is a radio reporter for the\nEnglish-language service of RTHK  \n\n \n\nsoapboxhk@hotmail.com", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "22ced1af-2769-45ef-bdf6-c140e8b557a3", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.912765+00:00"}

eat &rsquo; \" can either be followed by a NP\n&semi; or some modificational adverb , or just empty .\n\n\nBut \" &lsquo; know &rsquo; \" can be followed by much\nmore possibilities .\n\n\nThus it takes more time to comprehend and process , because there are\nmore possible prediction . \n \n\n( lc ) &lsquo; locutionary meaning &rsquo; is the\nliteral meaning of a sentence .\n\n\nThe meaning is  derived from the exact words of the\nsentence .\n\n\nFor example , for the sentence \" &lsquo; Do you know where\nthe fan is ? &rsquo; \" the locutionary meaning is a question asking\nthe addressee if he knows the location of the fan . \n \n\nHowever , in actual daily utterance , there is some &lsquo;\nillocutionary  force &rsquo; besides the locutory\nmeaning , &lsquo; illocutionary force &rsquo; is the intended  message the speaker wants to convey to the listener and wants him to\nrealize that message .\n\n\nThis is not literal mentioned by the words , but is implied or\nembodied in the sentence .\n\n\nThe &lsquo; illocutionary force &rsquo; needs the listener to infer\nand gather with relation to the context and utterance situation . \n \n\nFor example , if the above question is uttered by a wife to her\nhusband in the hot sitting-room , it may be carrying the illocutionary force\nof &lsquo; request &rsquo; that it is a request for the husband to turn on\nthe fan or take it out or so . \n \n\nThe &lsquo; locutionary meaning &rsquo; &ampersand; &lsquo;\nillocutionary force &rsquo; are both intended by the speakers  ie both are controlled from the speakers .\n\n \n\n&lsquo; Perlocutionary effect &rsquo; however , is not  always what the speaker intended .\n\n\nIt is the actual effect created by the utterance that the listener\nreceives &ampersand; feels .\n\n\nIt is not controlled by the speaker .\n\n\nFor example , if the above question \" &lsquo; Do you know\nwhere the fan is ? &rsquo; \" is uttered somewhat loudly &ampersand;\nrudely , it may carry an perlocutionary effect on the husband that he will\nfeel that it is a &lsquo; scolding &rsquo; rather than a request , even\nthough the wife doesn't mean  to scold him .  \n\n\n( ld ) The Maxims of  Grice &lsquo;\ns Cooperative Principle \n \n\nQuantity : to give enough , but not too much information that is\nneeded . \n \n\nQuality : to give information that the speaker believes to be\ntrue , that means , not telling lies . \n \n\nRelevance : to give information that is relevant .\n\n\nDon't give irrelevant <unc>  </unc>\ninformation . \n \n\nManner : Be brief , don't give information in an unnecessary long\nway . \n \n\nBe orderly , give information according to the reasonable order .\n\n\n Avoid ambiguity.\n\n\nAvoid absurdity . \n \n\nThe above Cooperative Principle assumes that people will\ncooperate as a speaker in conversation .\n\n\nThe main aim of them is  to    communicate effectively .\n\n\nSo they will follow the above maxims . \n \n\nHowever , in actual conversation ,  very often\nthe above maxim will be flouted .\n\n\nBut this flouting is deliberate and it  does  carry some\ncommunicative effect .\n\n\nThe flouting of maxim can lead the listener to infer that there  are certain implicatures behind it . \n \n\nFor example , if a person says , &lsquo;  My brother &lsquo; s father hit me last night , &rsquo; it is a\nflout of Maxim of Manner -;\n\n\nBe true .\n\n\nBut in fact , it suggests that maybe the speaker &ampersand;  his brother have different father but same brother .\n\n\nSuch kind of relationship can be implicated . \n \n\nThe Maxim of  Quality can be flouted to\nachieve  rhetorical effect ,\nsuch as the semantic derivation for  metaphor :\n&lsquo; He is a snake\" . \n \n\nThe Maxim of Quantity can be flouted to achieve understatement ,\nor hyperbole effect eg He is as big as a mountain . \n \n\nThe Maxim of Relevance can imply \nconversational implicature .\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\nA : What are my chocolate?\n\n\nB : I felt hungry last night . \n \n\nB &lsquo; s answer may seem irrelevant , flouting the Maxim of\nRelevance .\n\n\nHowever , in fact it is an implicature   inferred\n that B has eaten A &lsquo; s chocolates . \n \n\n \n \n\nIn brief , since  listener will assumes\nspeaker to follow the Gricean Principle in conversation , the deliberate\nviolation or flouting of maxim can make the listener to infer the\nconversational implicature .\n\n\nIt can also achieve certain rhetorical effect , eg. figure of speech .\n\n\n\n( 1f ) The role of speech errors in psycholinguistics\nstudies is very important .\n \n\nSpeech errors can give hints to the linguists for hypothesis .\n\n\nSince speech errors is the actual performance -; the production\nproduct , it is the strongest evidence &ampersand; data the linguists can use\nto analyse the production process of people .\n\n\nSince production is a process mainly abstract and \nmental , it is not easy to get to know what is in one &lsquo; s mind or brain\n,  when one is producting the language .\n\n\nAlso of the product is not  erroraneous  , it is no way for\nthe analyse of their process .\n\n\nIt is from the error that the linguists can trace the process . \n \n\nFor example , from the error : \" &lsquo; I cut  some knifes with  an orange &rsquo;\n\" which is the error of \" &lsquo; I cut \nsome oranges with a knife &rsquo; \" .\n\n\nWe can see an exchange of words &lsquo; oranges &rsquo; &ampersand;\n&lsquo; knife &rsquo; which happens in lexical access process .\n\n\nWe can see that the article \" &lsquo; an &lsquo; \"\n&ampersand;  \" &lsquo; the &rsquo; \" follows\nthe stranded word. \n \n\nFrom this we can get to know that in production , lexical item\nwill be selected and fill into the syntactic slot before the grammatical\nrules applies to them .\n\n\nThus the lexical item \" &lsquo; knife &rsquo; \" will\nbecome \" &lsquo; knives &rsquo; \" because it has to\naccommodate the contextual   environment  .\n\n\nThe \" &lsquo; some &rsquo; \" makes it change to\nplural form . \n \n\nFrom the example , we can see that speech error can help\nlinguists to conjecture speech production model .\n\n\nSince errors are very common &ampersand; easy to find , it can\nprovide enough evidence &ampersand; data for their generalization &ampersand;\nhypothesis about the mental activity of people in production.  \n\n\n4 \n \n\nThis model by Levelt consists of several <unc>  </unc> components .\n\n\nConceptualizer , Formulator , Articulator &ampersand;\nSpeech-comprehension system .\n\n\nEach component is a specialist who need not consult other component\nin their process .\n\n\nThey are autonomous , and they take the characteristic output of the\n<unc>  </unc> other component as their\nown input .\n\n\nThis is called &lsquo; informational encapsulation &rsquo; .\n\n\nSince the process is in incremental operation -; in parallel ,\nnot serial , speech errors may occur in every level .\n\n\nNow let &lsquo; s look into each process in  detail . \n \n\nThe    Conceptualize is divided\ninto 2 group .\n\n\nThe first is message generation .\n\n\nIt plans the message .\n\n\nThe Macroplanning conceives the communication intention , elaborate\n the goal into subgoals &ampersand; select &ampersand; arrange\ninstrumental information to realize these goals .\n\n\nThe Microplanning assigns the proper shape of the information and the\nperspective of information .\n\n\nIn a sense , it plans how to assign &lsquo; accessibility status\n&rsquo; the referentialist of referent , the topic , &ampersand; focus of\ninformation , the propositionalization &ampersand; other language-specific\nrequirement , so that it can guide the addressee how to interpret the message\nmore effectively . \n \n\nSince this stage is message generation Stage , the most probable\nerrors is mismatch  or mis-selection of situation .\n\n\nAnd also there may be errors in focus &ampersand; emphasis -;\nmisselectlon of focus &ampersand; emphasis . \n \n\nIn this conceptualizer , there is another function : monitoring .\n\n\nAs message is generated , the speaker will keep track of what is said\nbefore and self-monitor what should be generated .\n\n\nIt will book-keep the discourse type , discourse topic , discourse\nfocus , discourse model ( content &ampersand; information ) ,\netc. , and adjust what message should be generated .\n\n\nThe misconceive of <unc>  </unc>\nintention &ampersand; message here  must lead to speech\nerrors is caused by the failure in &lsquo; bookkeeping &rsquo; in monitoring .\n\n \n\nThe message generated &ampersand; arranged is preverbal message ,\nand will be stored in a Working Memory . \n \n\nThen it comes to Formulator .\n\n\nFormulator is divided into two process .\n\n\n The Grammatical Encoder &ampersand; the\nPhonological Encoder .\n\n\nThe message will  trigger the suitable lexical items\nfor the grammatical encoding .\n\n\nThe lexical item is accessed from the mental lexicon , which  stores the semantic , syntactic , morphological &ampersand;\nphonological information of the lexical items .\n\n\nThe semantic -; the meaning , &ampersand; the syntactic\ninformation  of the lexical item is called the &lsquo; lemma\n&rsquo; &ampersand; the information it provides will  give\ngrammatical info. for the grammatical encoding .\n\n\nThe lemma will point to the forms of the lexical items the\nmorphological &ampersand; phonological information which is the information\nfor the phonological encoding . \n \n\nThe message will trigger lexical item which is appropriate in\nmeaning &ampersand; syntax -; Lexical Access -;\n\n\nThis Access Process is in   parallel  , not\nserial ,  and  there is also a principle of &lsquo; convergence &rsquo; -;\n\n\neach position can only choose one best item .\n\n\nThus some errors may occur in this process . \n \n\nFailure of lexical Access will result in errors such as\nblending:\n\n\n&lsquo; I have  a clear\nplace &rsquo; \n \n\n\" &lsquo; Clear &rsquo; \" blended from\n\" &lsquo; clean &rsquo; \" &ampersand;  \" &lsquo; near &rsquo; \" .\n\n\nSince the 2 words is semantically related there is a    conceptual intrusion .\n\n\nThe two words compete for one single syntactic slot &ampersand; thus\nis blended .\n\n\nExchange of word also happens here :\n\n\n&lsquo; I have cut the tree in the rain'\n\n\n&lsquo; I have cut the rain in the tree &rsquo; \n \n\nSince the two words is associated , it is associative intrusion .\n\n\nThe two message fragment of \" &lsquo; tree &rsquo;\n\" &ampersand; \" &lsquo; rain &rsquo; \" active at\nthe same time &ampersand; exchange happens here.\n\n\nAlso , wrong choice of word , substitution of words may occur here .\n\n \n\nThe output of Grammatical Encoding is surface structure which is\nstored in syntactic Buffer .\n\n\nThe morphological &ampersand; phonological info. Become the source\nof Phonological Encoder , which builds  &ampersand;  retrieve  phonetic plans for the lexical items &ampersand; the\nutterance as a whole .\n\n\nIt spells out the stored-form representation &ampersand; projections\non pronouncable syllable on these items .\n\n\nThe failure of identify a stored form of the item may result in Tip\nof the Tongue -; TOT . \n \n\nThe Phonological Encoder is composed of four  sub-processor : the morphological The morphological/metrical\nspellout , the Segmental Spellout , the Phonetic Spellout &ampersand; the\nProsody Generator . \n \n\nThe morphological/metrical spellout uses the lemma to <unc>\n </unc> access the morphological/metrical  component .\n\n\nIt has a frame with slots to be filled .\n\n\nOne slot is the lemma , others is filled with the feature such as\ntense , person , no. etc .\n\n\nWhen all slots are filled , it will spell out the information :  \n \n\nThe lexical will be   separated  in\nmorpheme , &ampersand; also the metrical peak will be assigned . \n \n\nIn this stage , errors comes from the misselection of filler for\nthe slot -; misselection of tense , no . or person filler .\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n&lsquo; If I  had known  it , I would have do it &rsquo;\n\n\n&lsquo; If I  knew  it , I would have do it &rsquo;\n\n\nThe errors comes from the misput of filler &lsquo; past &rsquo;\ninstead of &lsquo; past perfect &rsquo; in the &lsquo; tense &rsquo; slot .\n\n \n\nThe output of this stage will come to the Segmental Spellout ,\nwhich divides the morphemes into syllables &ampersand; segments .\n\n\nThe same  kind  of frame &ampersand; slot is to be filled :\n \n \n\nThe Segmental Spellout spellouts the word into syllables\n&ampersand; then divide it into &lsquo; onset &rsquo; &lsquo; nucleus &rsquo;\n&ampersand; &lsquo; code &rsquo; .\n\n\nThe cluster need further &lsquo; cluster spellout procedure &rsquo; .\n\n \n\nError in this stage result from misselection of filler in the\nslot -; misselection of affix info , for example:\n\n\n&lsquo; I put the steaks into the freezer'\n\n\n&lsquo; I put the freezes into the steaker'\n\n\nThere is a wrong choice of morpheme in the two error words . \n \n\nAlso , misselected  metrical info. Will\nresult in &lsquo; SegmEnted &rsquo;  &arrow; &lsquo;\nsEgmented &rsquo;  \n\n\n&star; To be continued.\n \n\nThe segmental spellout output will go to the  phonetic spellout in which the segments are specified with phones .\n\n \n\nThe phones are in fact not fixed , &ampersand; \nvaries according to context &ampersand; free parameter such as duration .\n\n \n\nThe frame is also here to be filled :  \n \n\nThe error in this stage result from inappropriate fillers filled\ninto the slot .\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\nExchange:\n\n\nI  go to the left house\n\n\n&arrow;I go to the heft louse . \n \n\nIn the first error , \" / h/ \" is activated\nfaster and fill in the slot wrongly , and \" / h/ \" is thus\nchecked off &ampersand; thus remain \" / l/ \" unused , so it\nis used later in &lsquo; louse &rsquo; . \n \n\nThis kind of misfill of filler makes a lot of speech errors ,\nsuch as  Anticipation of Phoneme:\n\n\nI have a good foot\n\n\n&arrow; I have a food foot . \n \n\nPresentation :\n\n\nI have a photo tool &arrow;\n\n\nI  have a photo fool omission , ( haplology\n) , addition &ampersand; shift of phoneme , etc . \n \n\nAll the phonetic plans from the Phonological encoder  is internal speech stored in Articulatory Buffer .\n\n\nAnd the Articular will  execute the muscle\nand organs to    pronounce   the word .\n\n\nIn the articulation , the  potential error is\n&lsquo; tongue twister &rsquo; which is  resulted from inapproprite articulation of the organs .\n\n \n\nIn fact , during the whole process , there is a self-monitoring\nprocess from the speech-comprehension system .\n\n\nThis system will  listen both the overt\nspeech &ampersand; the internal speech &ampersand; make  correct  as\nsoon as problem is detected . \n \n\nThe  correction is not  always , but is \nselective , &ampersand;   fluctuates  &ampersand;\nalso correct occurs mostly in the end of a phrase .\n\n\nIf a word is correct , it is usually preserve , but if the word\nitself is wrong , it will break off at once .\n\n\nThis is known as &lsquo; Main  Interruption\nRule &rsquo; .\n\n\nThe correction will interrupt the speech at once , and this result\nin \" &lsquo; I want to have  - er-  go home &rsquo;\n\" \n \n\nThe correction usually will preserve the syntactic\nwellformedness &ampersand; original syntax of the utterance .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a5e5acdf-9182-44a9-a9cf-9b15f7c8b502", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.914308+00:00"}
{"text": "MY SISTER  ' S DIARY   \n\n\nSHARON SUNG SAU FUN \n\n \n\nI was the only one at home .\n\n\nAfter eating last night  ' s leftovers for lunch , I threw myself onto\nthe bed .\n\n\nMy eyes fixed on the ceiling and I was thinking of what to do next .\n\n\nListening to the television could not dissipate my boredom .\n\n\nJust like the previous times , the idea of \" treasure seeking\n&rdquo; stuck me all of a sudden .\n\n\nMy sister and I shared the same room .\n\n\nEven though I knew every single one of her belongings inside out , I\nstill secretly enjoyed checking out her stuff every now and then .\n\n\nJust as in the past , I fumbled for her key under the earthenware\nmoney-box on the top shelf .\n\n\nThe next moment I was sitting on my sister  ' s bed and unlocking her\npersonal drawer in the little cabinet by her bed .\n\n\nAgain I looked into her school result records , yearbooks , the\nlittle gifts given by her friends , and her collection of invaluable\nornaments .\n\n\nThe entire examination took less than an hour .\n\n\nTo my disappointment , she did not have any new items in her\ncollection .\n\n\nLocking up her drawing , I lay flat on her bed dwelling on my boredom .\n\n\nI stretched my arms and was about to fold them behind my head when\nthey hit upon something underneath her pillow .\n\n\nI pulled it out .\n\n\nAn elegant diary in a deep-red velvet cover was before me .\n\n\nIn my many years of treasure-seeking , I had never learned that my\nsister kept a diary .\n\n\nShe must have forgotten to put it back in its safe place after\nwriting in it .\n\n\nI took a quick deep breath and flipped it open . \n\n \n\n 12 November 1978\n\n\n\" Open that damn door , I  ' ll throw this eyesore out of my\nplace ! &rdquo;\n\n\nFrenzy in her eyes , the distraught mother of five yelled at the rest\nof her children while her hand which was grasping hold of her 14-year-old\ndaughter  ' s hair made a sudden jerk .\n\n\nA loud shriek immediately followed .\n\n\nThe little girl with her hands pressing against her hair from the\npull had her body twisted under the pain .\n\n\nWailing plaintively , she asked herself what she had done wrong this\ntime .\n\n\n\" Don't get angry with that kid , she didn't mean to disobey\nyou .\n\n\nIt is only because she wanted to study for her exam that she\nsuggested you make the little brother mop the floor for her .\n\n\nAnyway , she has already had enough by now .\n\n\nFor my sake , let her go . &rdquo;\n\n\nThe helpless father who was back home on leave from his sailor  ' s job\nforced out a pleasing voice and look , trying his best to soothe his wife  ' s\nfury .\n\n\n\" Don't get yourself involved in it , it  ' s none of your\nbusiness !\n\n\nYou  ' d better stay out of my way ! &rdquo;\n\n\nHis wife  ' s furious eyes turned upon him , whereupon he no longer\nuttered another word.\n\n\nThe horrified children were scared stiff by the scene even though it\nwas not the first time their mother had acted in this manner .\n\n\nThey hid behind the half-opened kitchen door next to the main gate .\n\n\nThey stayed motionless despite their mother  ' s howling order :\n\n\n\" Don't you all hear me ?\n\n\nGo open that damn door ! &rdquo;\n\n\nThe mother was getting more furious .\n\n\nThe little girl was twitching in response to her mother  ' s hysteria .\n\n\nShe struggled to wriggle free from the grip but stopped after a crisp\nhot slap on her left ear .\n\n\nIn contrast to the burning on her face , a surge of coolness ran\nquickly down to her heart .\n\n\nShe was no longer crying and her eyes were fixed on somewhere remote .\n\n\nWhile his little brothers and sister were squatting and covering\ntheir ears with their little shrinking hands , the eldest son , a year older\nthan the little girl , with an emotionless face , strode out of the kitchen ,\napproached the main door , unlocked and thrust it wide open .\n\n\n\" Get away from my place .\n\n\nI don't want you to be my daughter and you stay out of my sight !\n&rdquo;\n\n\nThe frenzied mother , with all her strength , dragged her daughter\ntoward the door .\n\n\nIn the wake of the pain from her head , the little girl begged her\nmother to stop while firmly clinging to the kitchen  ' s threshold with one of\nher hands .\n\n\nBoiling with uncontrollable anger , after failing to detach the\nlittle body from the threshold , the mother abruptly hit her daughter  ' s head\nfrantically against the wall .\n\n\nGiddy from the blows , the girl  ' s grip involuntarily loosened at\nlast .\n\n\nShe was thrust out of the door which banged in her face .\n\n\nAfter warning everyone to stay away from the door , the mother dashed\nback to her room .\n\n\nNot knowing what to do , the frustrated father trailed his wife to\nthe room .\n\n\nIn the living room , the children watched helplessly at their sister\nwho sobbed outside the gate .\n\n\nHer brother waited until he heard his mother  ' s snoring &semi; he\nwalked towards the door , unlocked it and let his sister in.  \n\n \n\nRaising my eyes from the diary , I stared out of the window .\n\n\nIf it was not for her diary , I might have all these unpleasant\nscenes buried with the past , and gone from my memory .\n\n\nI was very young then , three years old , I guess .\n\n\nOur family was very poor then .\n\n\nOur father , for the sake of the appealing salary , worked as a\nsailor and spent twice the time working at sea than with his wife and\nchildren on land .\n\n\nOur mother , from Macau and with no relatives in Hong Kong , was on\nher own to care for five little children .\n\n\nThe family burden probably was too heavy for a helpless woman and her\naccumulated frustration finally turned on her children .\n\n\nUnfortunately , my sister had always been at the receiving end .\n\n\nWhy was it her ?\n\n\nI did not really know , but I always knew my mother was one of those\ntraditional women who favoured their sons over their daughters .\n\n\nMy sister and I were the only girls in the family , and I was then\ntoo little and fragile to be ill-treated .\n\n\nFeeling a bit reluctant to continue with those scenes , I leaped some\npages ahead . \n\n \n\n 19-30 November 1978\n\n\nThe brother had his school excursion today .\n\n\nBefore dawn , the mother had jumped to her feet , bound to the\nkitchen to prepare his food .\n\n\nAs in the previous year , she made a pack of fried-egg sandwiches , a\ncouple of sauced chicken-wings and 3 packs of Vitasoy for him .\n\n\nThe tempting smell of the chicken-wings made the girl  ' s mouth water .\n\n\nShe watched the food enviously , thinking how fortunately her brother\nwas to have such delicious food for an excursion .\n\n\nThen when she thought of her own excursion the following week , she\nforgot about her brother  ' s food and felt the excitement in her at the\napproaching date .\n\n\nAt 7am , before the alarm sounded , she sprang from her bed nervously\n, stumbled in her slippers , then dashed into the kitchen to greet her food\npack that her mother would have already prepared for her excursion .\n\n\nNothing was on the table .\n\n\nNo aroma of cooking drifted from the gloomy kitchen and there was no\nsign of her mother in the kitchen or the living room .\n\n\nGingerly she turned the doorknob of her parents  '  bedroom and peeped\ninto the crack .\n\n\nHer mother was still sleeping on her bed !\n\n\nHeart sunk to the bottom , the girl remembered she had given her\nmother the excursion notice from school and she surely knew today was the\ndate .\n\n\nA hand rested on her shoulder .\n\n\nLooking over her shoulder , she found her brother behind her .\n\n\nBefore she had the chance to say anything , he stuffed something in\nher hand .\n\n\nUnfolding her hand , she saw a five-dollar coin shimmering on her\nlittle palm .\n\n\nShe raised her questioning eyes upon him .\n\n\nHe urged her to go to buy some buns and drinks quickly , or the\nschool bus would leave without her .\n\n\nOverwhelmed with emotions , the girl failed to utter a word .\n\n\nAgain , her brother urged her to hurry .\n\n\nFinally , without any more thought , she gave him a grateful glance ,\ndashed down the stairs and disappeared into the street.  \n\n \n\nI turned to the middle of the diary . \n\n \n\n 1-30 June 1983\n\n\nThe brother started his own business selling computers five months\nago .\n\n\nHis sole partner who had seen little profit from the business finally\ndecided to withdraw from the partnership .\n\n\nThe brother came home to talk to his mother , to borrow money from\nher to buy up his partner  ' s share .\n\n\nMeanwhile , his sister had finished her matriculation study by the\nmiddle of June .\n\n\nAmong her siblings , she was the one who had achieved the best\nresults in school .\n\n\nShe , nevertheless , decided to comply with her mother  ' s arrangement\n, not to continue with her studies , but to work for her brother who could\nnot afford to employ anyone .\n\n\nIn the bottom of heart , she felt miserable for herself .\n\n\nBut for her mother , she knew she would have made an even bigger\nsacrifice .  \n\n \n\n 1-30 October 1984\n\n\nThe mother once again made a great fuss about the shortage in her\nmonthly household allowance from her son .\n\n\nShe scolded him for not giving her any money for more than four\nmonths .\n\n\nThe brother had his head lowered before her but did not utter a word .\n\n\nSeeing his silence , the mother heightened her complaint and accused\nhim of being irresponsible and unfilial .\n\n\nHer accusations kept going on and on .\n\n\nTo her own dismay , the sister stepped out from the back .\n\n\nConfronting her mother , she loudly pointed out that the computer\nstore had never made a profit .\n\n\nThe profit was so little that it was merely enough to meet the rent\nand the necessary expenses every month .\n\n\nShe proclaimed that she had never been paid !\n\n\nUnaccustomed to such a refutation , the mother flushed with anger\nand shifted her anger to her daughter .\n\n\nShe lashed out at her daughter  ' s rudeness and ingratitude .\n\n\nThe girl was silent and accepted the scolding .  \n\n \n\n 24 December 1986\n\n\nIt was the first time the brother had brought a girl home for dinner\n, a very elegant and presentable girl .\n\n\nShe had the average height of Asian women , with long straight hair\nand a pair of big watery eyes .\n\n\nNever had the sister seen her brother so attentive to anyone .\n\n\nHe filled the girl  ' s bowl with food , refilled her rice-bowl and\nglass .\n\n\nFor an unknown reason , the sister felt a sour surge in her .\n\n\nShe was silent and heavy-hearted during the dinner .\n\n\nAfter the brother left to escort the girl home , the sister returned\nto her room and finally burst into tears .  \n\n \n\n 1 August 1990\n\n\nThe wedding was splendid .\n\n\nBeing the eldest son of the family , the brother was the pride of\nhis parents and his wedding was the way they chose to show their dignity to\nthe world .\n\n\nThe sister was watching the newlywed couple file between the fifty\ntables .\n\n\nThe elegant bride changed into three sets of evening gown throughout\nthe wedding banquet , while her bridegroom was busy greeting his business\nfriends .\n\n\nAfter striving for more than seven years , the brother had finally\nestablished his place in the market and earned his reputation .\n\n\nNevertheless , he seldom noticed that his sister was forever working\nat the back of the store , exhausting herself at work till late every night .\n \n\n \n\n 3 September 1990 \n\n\n\" It  ' s enough !\n\n\nI know you are reading my diary\n\n\nWhoever you are ,\n\n\nI ask you to respect my little privacy

{"text": "Liberal Party to visit Tai Po handicapped  \n\n\nBy STELLA LEE  \n\n \n\nLIBERAL Party members -; accused of exploiting the row over\nthe Laguna City centre for former mental patients -; are to visit a\ntraining centre for the mentally handicapped in Tai Po on Sunday . \n\n \n\nThe trip is part of the conservative party  ' s plans for winning\nvotes in the 1995 Legislative Council elections . \n\n \n\nThe party has been accused of dropping its support for the Laguna\nCity centre in an attempt to win votes .\n\n\nResidents of the Kwun Tong housing estate have been campaigning to\nstop construction of the centre . \n\n \n\nAbout 30 party members , including chairman Allen Lee Peng-fei and\nSelina Chow Liang Shuk-yee , and district board members are expected to join\nthe visit . \n\n \n\nA member of the party  ' s preparatory committee , Yau Fook-ping ,\nwho announced the programme yesterday , said : \" I can say visiting the\ndistrict has a direct relation to the election . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nMr Yau said the aim of the visit was to make closer contact with\nthe public so as to find out their concerns , to promote the party and to\nrecruit new members . \n\n \n\nKowloon West and Central and Western Districts will be the next\ndestinations for Liberal Party visits . \n\n \n\n\" We have not even discussed it arrangements for the\nelection yet, &rdquo; Mr Yau said . \n\n \n\nHe rejected the idea that Tai Po was chosen because it lacked any\ndominating local group or political party , thus making it easier for the\nparty to make an impact . \n\n \n\nBut he said : \" People in Tai Po are friendlier than those\nin some other districts where people are quick to respond to issues by\ndemonstrations . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nHowever , he said every district was of equal importance and they\nplanned to visit them all . \n\n \n\nActivities on Sunday will include a meeting with district leaders\nand a visit to a school and home for the elderly .\n\n\nA question-and-answer session will be hosted by Mr Lee on noise\npollution caused by the Kowloon-Canton Railway .   \n\n \n\n\n Group attacks arts policy review   \n\n\n By STELLA LEE  \n\n \n\nA REVIEW expected to set the stage for government arts policy\nduring the next decade would leave Hongkong  ' s artistic freedom backstage ,\none group has claimed . \n\n \n\nOne of the territory  ' s few outspoken , experimental , artistic\ngroups , 10-year-old Zuni Icosahedron , said the government review paper\nreleased last week lacked critical elements , particularly concerning\nartistic freedom . \n\n \n\nZuni member Mr Mathias Woo Yan-wai said the review wrongly\nconcluded the Government had forged a social and creative environment\nconducive to growth of the arts . \n\n \n\n\" Freedom of arts expression has been ebbing over the past\n10 years , despite the fact that Hongkong seems to have more institutional\ndemocratic elements . \n\n \n\n\" Many vocal artistic groups in the early 1980s gradually\nfaded out as a result of the Government  ' s negative attitude towards them,\n&rdquo; Mr Woo said . \n\n \n\nHe cited an experience in 1991 when the Consul-General of Belgium\nasked the Government to sponsor Zuni to perform in last year  ' s Hongkong\nFestival in Belgium . \n\n \n\nMr Woo claimed the Government would have been happier to send all\nthe Zuni members away with a one-way , first-class ticket , provided the\ngroup disappeared from Hongkong forever . \n\n \n\nHe said that although this might only be a joke , the Government\ninsisted on excluding Zuni from the festival . \n\n \n\n\" The incident showed very clearly the Government  ' s\nattitude towards us .\n\n\nOver the past 10 years Zuni has faced subtle censorship like not\nbeing allowed to stage politically-sensitive performances at government\nvenues, &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe executive director of the Urban Council  ' s Hongkong Cultural\nCentre , Mr Wayne Maddern , said applicants were allowed to hire venues if\nthey got a permit from the commissioner of the Television and Entertainment\nLicensing Authority . \n\n \n\nHowever , Mr Woo criticised the commissioner for possessing too\nmuch discretionary power . \n\n \n\nMr Woo said Zuni  ' s counter-proposal would suggest separating the\ntwo municipal councils from management of the cultural venues , and they\nshould stay independent when considering applications .  \n\n \n\n\n Oil firms queried over rise in prices   \n\n\n By STELLA LEE  \n\n \n\nOIL companies have been accused of using increased staff costs as\nan excuse to justify price rises . \n\n \n\nThe accusation from legislators yesterday followed last November  ' s\nfour per cent price increase in Liquified Petroleum Gas ( LPG )\nwhich Shell and Mobil claimed was needed to cover increases in supply and\nsafety-related costs arising from new legislation . \n\n \n\nThe firms said the costs included safety-enhancing innovations\nsuch as providing additional crew for delivery companies . \n\n \n\nShell told the Economic Services and Public Utilities panel the\nadditional staff costs were &dollar;4.8 million . \n\n \n\nThis sum amounted to more than a third of the total &dollar;13.5\nmillion increase in operating costs claimed by the gas company as a result of\nthe new legislation . \n\n \n\nBut the newly-elected convenor of the panel , Mr Steven Poon\nKwok-lim , said there had been complaints from the dealers that no subsidy\nhad been given to them . \n\n \n\n\" The dealers have complained that they had been used as a\njustification for the price increase, &rdquo; \n\n \n\nChief Gas Safety and Enforcement engineer for the Electrical and\nMechanical Services Department , Mr Keith Whittle , said he did not know\nwhether any subsidy was given to the dealers . \n\n \n\n\" As a Gas Standards Office , we do not get involved in the\nfinance side of it , we are concerned about the safety side, &rdquo; he said .\n\n\n \n\nHe said the Consumer Council only approached the Gas Standards\nOffice to verify whether the items were included in the gas safety\nlegislation . \n\n \n\n\" It is up to the Consumer Council to deal with price\nincreases and not our office, &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\nUnited Democrats chairman Mr Martin Lee Chu-ming asked whether\nthe Government had checked whether Shell had recruited more gas specialists\nto meet the legislative workload . \n\n \n\nMr Whittle said it had not checked . \n\n \n\nLegislators will ask Shell and Mobil for more details at the next\npanel meeting .  \n\n \n\n\n Business group calls for action   \n\n\n By STELLA LEE  \n\n \n\nTHE Government is suppressing new businesses by allowing\ngovernment-subsidised organisations an unfair competitive edge , a coalition\nof private companies claimed yesterday . \n\n \n\nRepresentatives of the Coalition for Free Enterprise told\nlegislators on the Trade and Industry Panel that unfair competition was\nparticularly evident in the sale of advertising time and space , and even\nmanufacturing . \n\n \n\nThe coalition pinpointed four government-subsidised organisations\n-; the Trade Development Council , the Mass Transit Railway Corporation ,\nthe Hongkong Productivity Council and Radio Television Hongkong -; as\nenjoying unfair competition . \n\n \n\nIt said these organisations were offered significant discounts\nfor advertising , exhibitions , consulting and other services only because\ntheir financial health was assured by the Government . \n\n \n\nBut the call from legislators and the business sector for an\noverall review of the problem of unfair competition was turned down by the\nGovernment . \n\n \n\nSecretary for Trade and Industry Mr Brian Chau Tak-hay said :\n\" We see no need and we have no plan to review the situation . &rdquo;\n\n\n \n\nHe said it was government policy to encourage the subvented\nbodies to earn profits so they could become self-sufficient .  \n\n \n\n\n Legco gets tough on category III breaches   \n\n\n By STELLA LEE  \n\n \n\nCINEMA operators who allow people under 18 in to see category III\nfilms will soon be liable to fines of up to &dollar;50,000 -; five times\nmore than previous measures . \n\n \n\nLegislative Councillors from the Film Censorship (\nAmendment ) Bill committee had previously agreed that the proposal to\nraise the penalty be deferred until a suggested review of similar legislation\non category III videotapes . \n\n \n\nThe Crown Prosecutor had said an immediate increase from the\npresent &dollar;10,000 fine , fixed in 1988 , was necessary as a stronger\ndeterrent . \n\n \n\nThere had been no drop in breaches and prosecutions and the\nnumber of category III films was increasing , he said . \n\n \n\nAlthough there were only about 10 prosecutions in the past four\nyears , prosecutions were not made until an offender had been warned more\nthan once . \n\n \n\nSome committee members , including the Liberal Party  ' s Mrs\nSelina Chow Liang Shuk-yee , yesterday still supported deferring the increase\nuntil a review was completed . \n\n \n\nBut Deputy Secretary for Recreation and Culture , Mrs Rachel\nCartland , said it might take two years to draft and pass the amendment ,\ngiven the back-up of legislation waiting for drafting . \n\n \n\nA majority of the committee members supported the increase so it\ncould be forwarded for second reading and be passed within this Legco session .\n\n\n \n\nUnited Democrat Mr Cheung Man-kwong said the unreasonable\ndifference in penalties for similar offences should be rectified immediately .\n\n\n \n\nHe cited the example of a video-shop owner who faced a fine of\n&dollar;200,000 plus a one-year jail sentence for renting category III\nvideotapes to people under 18 . \n\n \n\nBut cinema operators protested against the proposed increase and\ncriticised the Government for making them take almost all the responsibility\nfor showing category III films to young people . \n\n \n\nThe chairman of the Hongkong Theatres Association , Mr Kong\nCho-yee , said it was difficult for cinema staff to identify who was under 18\nwhen hundreds of people entered the theatre within five to 10 minutes before\nthe film . \n\n \n\n\" We do not commit the offence purposefully .\n\n\nIt is an execution problem which cannot be solved even if the penalty\nis raised, &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\n\" It is unfair that only us and not the young people who go\nand watch category III films are fined . &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n\n Big rise in student aid applications   \n\n\n By STELLA LEE  \n\n \n\nMANPOWER at a government agency providing financial assistance to\ntertiary students will be boosted to cope with an increasing number of\napplicants due to rising college fees . \n\n \n\nApplication procedures will also be reviewed to avoid any delays\nin the issuing of payment for successful applicants in future , the Student\nFinancial Assistance Agency said yesterday . \n\n \n\nThe agency was expected to announce results of this year  ' s\napplications earlier this month , but the delays have caused concern among\nstudents . \n\n \n\nThose who cannot come up with money to pay tuition fees face\nlosing their college places .\n\n\nSome are being forced to borrow money from friends and relatives to\npay the fees in time . \n\n \n\nThe agency will announce today the results of the first batch of\n7,000 applications , while advance payments to the 6,000 successful\napplicants are expected to be available shortly . \n\n \n\nResults of another 7,000 applications will be ready in the first\nweek of next month and those of the remaining applications will be announced\nas soon as the processing is finished . \n\n \n\nAgency controller Alfred Wong Wai-kin said the delay for only a\n\" few days &rdquo; was caused by the increase in applicants and a\nshortage of staff . \n\n \n\nThe agency received 19,964 applications for the local student\nfinance scheme this year , an increase of 54.9 per cent over last year  ' s\n12,888 . \n\n \n\nMr Wong said the increase in tuition fees from &dollar;8,500 to\n&dollar;12,000 a term this year led to the surge in applicants. \n\n \n\n\" We already have an extra 10 temporary staff and five\npermanent staff this year who , however , are not enough for the workload,\n&rdquo; Mr Wong said . \n\n \n\nHe said they had planned to hire 10 more temporary staff and five\npermanent staff next April . \n\n \n\nHowever , Mr Wong said the increase might not be enough as the\nnumber of applicants was expected to continue to rise with the tuition fees\nover the next few years , to &dollar;20,500 a term by 1997-98 . \n\n \n\n\" We will continually review our staffing provision and\nstudy ways of streamlining the application procedures to make the processing\nwork more quickly, &rdquo; Mr Wong said . \n\n \n\n\" It has always been and will continue to be , the\nGovernment  ' s policy that no students will be unable to accept through lack\nof means the offer of a place at any of the University and Polytechnic Grants\nCommittee-funded tertiary institutions to pursue undergraduate studies .\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\n\n Publisher says June 4 changes followed advice   \n\n\n By STELLA LEE  \n\n \n\nA PUBLISHER yesterday defended his decision to tone down\nreferences to the June 4 crackdown in a history textbook , saying it was not\nself-censorship . \n\n \n\nManhattan Press executive director Jeffrey Shum Hing-wa said they\nwere just following the Education Department  ' s advice to rewrite the\ntextbook . \n\n \n\nMr Shum said : \" The department had some opinions , we had\nto follow .\n\n\nBut I do not view this as a kind of self-censorship . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe latest version of the Chinese text reads : \" Following\nthe economic reforms , phenomena like inflation , unbalanced development and\ncorruption by officials emerged in China , and these had aroused government\nconcern and dissatisfaction of some members of the public . \n\n \n\n\" In May 1989 , young students protested at Beijing  ' s\nTiananmen Square .\n\n\nIn June , the Government intervened to end the situation . &rdquo;\n\n\n \n\nThe phrase \" people from all walks of lives &rdquo; in the\noriginal text has been replaced by \" some members of the public &rdquo; .\n\n\n \n\nNewly added phrases are the inflation and development problems ,\nand the government concern . \n\n \n\nMr Shum said rewriting the text had delayed the publication by\nmore than a month and more than 10 inquiries a day had been received from\nparents and schools to check if the book was ready . \n\n \n\nAnother publisher , Lingkee Publishing , has also changed the\nreference in a footnote from \" clearing of Tiananmen Square &rdquo; to\n\" Tiananmen Square events &rdquo; in a new history textbook . \n\n \n\nAcademics said the changes were \" damages &rdquo;\nresulting from the way the Education Department had handled the incident .\n\n\n \n\nDirector of Education , Dominic Wong Shing-wah , advised\nManhattan Press to remove references to June 4 as history within the last 20\nyears without established assessment should not be covered in school history\ntextbooks . \n\n \n\nHe later backed down and said such events should be handled with\ncare . \n\n \n\nA history teacher Leung Hing-lok said publishers should learn to\nexercise their academic autonomy appropriately . \n\n \n\nSenior lecturer of Chinese University  ' s history department , Dr\nKwok Siu-tong , said legislators should push harder at the department and\nChief Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang to admit mishandling the incident .\n\n\n \n\nDr Kwok criticised Mrs Chan , who had said the department had\nnot mishandled the case as there was no political motive , for trying to\nprotect the department .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ccdecc91-26f4-4b16-8f16-8ab077ef9a37", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.917373+00:00"}
{"text": "4.\n \n\nStarch is made up of glucose subunit linked together by a\n<unc> symbol </unc> glycosidic linkage .\n\n\nOf the five hydroxyl group on the glucose molecules , only 2 of them\nare involved in the formation of glycosidic linkage .\n\n\nThe other 3 hydroxyl group on the glucose subunit of starch molecules\nhave got the tendency to interacting with each other by forming hydrogen\nbonding .\n\n\nTherefore , starch molecule in solution may either precipitate out or\nforming a gel when allowing it to stand at gravity for some time .\n\n\nIf the conc. of starch is high enough and the temp. is low , a gel\nmade up of starch molecules will be formed .\n\n\nOn the other hand , if the conc. of starch is low and the temp. is not\nlow enough , the starch molecules will be precipitated out .\n\n\nSuch tendency for starch molecules to interact together when in\naqueous solution is defined as retrogradation .\n\n\nGeneral retrogradation are more likely to happen in amylose than in\namylopectin molecules because the side branch of amylopectin molecules deter\nits interaction .\n\n\nSuch phenomenon is used to explain many storage properties of\nstarch-based food .\n\n\nFor example , the staling of bread can be explained partly by\nretrogradation .\n\n\nDuring baking , the starch granules swell and the linear amylose\nmolecules will leak out and interact with the water molecules to form a\nconsistent gel .\n\n\nWhen the bread is being stored for some time , the bread will become\nharder in texture and unpalatable .\n\n\nThis is called staling of bread .\n\n\nIt is mainly the retrogradation of amylopectin molecules that result\nin such phenomenon .\n\n\nThe amylopectin molecules in the starch granule will not be leaked\nout from the granule when the dough is heated in fresh bread , the\namylopectin will exist in a dilated state that is mainly contribute the bread\nfreshness .\n\n\nAfter storing for some time , the amylopectin molecules will then\nunder go some form of retrogradation and that will result in the formation of\na rather rigid structures in the bread .\n\n\nAnother example of retrogradation may found in jellies .\n\n\nThe fresh jellies will form a translucent and soft gel .\n\n\nWhen it is undergo several freeze-thaw cycle , the gel will become\nopaque , hard and watery .\n\n\nIt is due to the fact that starch molecule will have the ability to\nmove as a result of free water formed in thawing .\n\n\nSuch interaction will prevent the  \nreformation  of the gel structure when the gel structure is being freeze\nagain . \n \n\n( a ) The behaviour of starch in aqueous (\nmainly in dilute aqueous solution ) solution can be studied by\nperforming a viscosity analysis and the resulting graph showing the change of\nviscosity with time and temp. is called viscoamylograph .\n\n\nHowever , in most food system , the aqueous starch solution is very\nconcentrated .\n\n\nSo the result from viscoamylograph may not correctly reflect the\nactual situation .\n\n\nDuring the experiment , the starch solution is being stirred with a\ncertain shear rate and the temperature of the solution is being altered in a\nprogrammed .\n\n\nThe following figure is a stylized result of such experiment :  \n \n\nWhen the starch solution is being heated and stirred at below its\ngelatinization temp. , the viscosity of the solution doesn't increase at all .\n\n\nAfter the gelatinization occur ( i.e. loss of birefringence\n) , the viscosity increase because of the taking up of water by the\nswelling starch   granules  and the release of amylose\nmolecules to the surrounding water .\n\n\nThe extent of starch solubulization increase with the increase in\ntemp .\n\n\nThe temp. is raised to 95&degree;C and it is not intended to increase\nfurther because water will be boiled at higher temp .\n\n\nComplete solubulization of starch will not occur at temp. smaller\nthan 120&degree;C and so complete solubilization of starch never occur in any\nfood system .\n\n\nThis stage of increasing viscosity with temp. ( i.e. a-b in\nthe graph ) is called pasting because a paste of starch solution is\nbeing formed .\n\n\nThe starch solution is the hold at 95&degree;C for 1 hour and the\nviscosity start to decrease .\n\n\nIt is due to the fact of shear thinning i.e. the orientation of the\nstarch molecule in the same direction to the starch solution is being stirred .\n\n\nAfter time C , the starch solution is cooled down slowly and the\nviscosity is increased again .\n\n\nIt is because as the temp. is being lowered , the energy in the\nsystem will be lowered and there is a higher tendency for hydrogen bond\nformation which contribute to the increase in viscosity .\n\n\nThis is called set back stage . \n \n\nAlthough , viscoamylographic technique can only determine the\nstarch in dilute solution , the understanding of which is also important for\ninvestigating the properties of starch in concentrated food system . \n \n\n3. The utilization of corn can be roughly divided into two\ncategories i.e. the utilization of the primary products and the secondary\nproducts of corn processing . ( dry and wet milling ) \n \n\nThe primary products for corn processing is starch .\n\n\nStarch can be diverted into industrial use or food .\n\n\nFor industrial purpose , starch is mainly used for the production of\npaper or cohesives .\n\n\nFor food uses , the starch molecules can be modified by a variety of\nprocesses ( e.g. cross linking , acid thinning , substitution )\nso that the physical properties of the starch molecules can be adjusted for\ndifferent purposes .\n\n\nMostly the starch is being used as an  \nthickening  or bulking agent in food so as to give foods a good mouthful .\n\n\nFor example , chicken used for deep frying are usually coated with a\nlayer of starch to give a thickened properties .\n\n\nOn the other hand , starch from corn can be utilized for the\nformation of sweeteners .\n\n\nThe process usually involving acid , acid/enzyme or enzymes process\nto convert starch molecules to sweeteners .\n\n\nIn most cases , enzymes ( pullulanase glucoamylase , &alpha;\nand &beta; amylase , isomerase ) are used in preference to acid for\nhydrolyzing starch molecules because the acid catalyzed reaction is not\nspecific and many sided reaction may occur that result in the formation of\nundesirable odour and flavour .\n\n\nThe major sweeteners made from corn starch are : dextrose ,\nmaltodextrin , high fructose corn syrup , regular corn syrup .\n\n\nTheir difference can be stated by the term called dextrose equivalent .\n\n\nThis term represent the relative reducing power of a carbohydrate to\npure dextrose .\n\n\nSince starch molecules contain only one reducing group , it has a DE\nof O .\n\n\nAs the degree o hydrolysis is being increased , the reduced power and\nhence DE will be increased .\n\n\nDextrose is actually glucose and have a DE of &greater-than; 99.4 .\n\n\nMaltodextrin has the DE &less-than; 20 while corn syrup has DE\nbetween 20-99.4 .\n\n\nHigh fructose corn syrup is being a special kind of syrup and is not\ndefined under the DE system .\n\n\nThe dextrose and corn syrup has a high osmotic potential and are\nsweet so they are being used in a variety of food system , e.g. bakery ,\nconfectionery , ice cream , biscuits , etc .\n\n\nThe maltodextrin is not sweet and since it has got a high molecular\nweight , ( <symbol> because </symbol> of low degree of hydrolysis\n) , it is used mainly as an bulking and thickening agent in food\nsimilar to pure starch .\n\n\nHigh fructose corn syrup is a special kind of syrup that contain\nabout 55% of fructose that is formed by conversion of glucose to\nfructose by isomerase .\n\n\nIt is 1.8 times sweeter than sucrose and 2.4 times sweeter than\nglucose .\n\n\nAlso , its sweetness is increased at lower temp .\n\n\nTherefore , its major use is in replacing sucrose in soft drinks .\n\n \n\nThe secondary products from corn wet and dry milling process\nincluding the protein , corn steep liquor ( condensed fermented corn\nextractives ) , the bran ( fibrous materials from the corn\n) and corn germ .\n\n\nMost of the usage of these by products is converted to animal feed .\n\n\nFor example , corn gluten meal is mainly the protein from corn that\nis highly digestable and contain rich amount of carotene and xanthophyll and\nso is a good feed to poultry animals .\n\n\nHowever protein contain high amount of sulphur containing amino acid\nand low amount of essential amino acid lysine tryptophan .\n\n\nSo feed high amt. of corn protein to animal may lead to a.a.\ndeficiency .\n\n\nSoy bean protein contain high amt of essential a.a. and low amount of\nsulphur containing amino acid and so is a good supplement to corn gluten meal .\n\n\nAnother feed is called corn gluten feed that is actually a mixture of\nbran , corn germ and corn steep liquor .\n\n\nIt is similar to corn gluten meal except that it contain lower amount\nof protein .\n\n\nThe corn germ is another useful byproducts because it can be used to\nextract the oil content and the corn oil made has got a good consume image .\n\n\nIt is because corn oil contain large amount of poly-unsaturated fatty\nacid that is beneficial to health .\n\n\nAlso , the corn oil do not form wax under refrigeration and has\nhigher oxidative stability . \n \n\nApart from the above two categories , the corn can also be used\nas a substrate for fermentation to produce industrial ethyl alcohol and\nalcoholic beverages .\n\n\nIn such process , whole corn is grounded and slurried , heated to\ngelatinize the starch and then saccharified by the enzymes .\n\n\nThe simple sugar formed is then fermented by yeast to form alcohol .\n\n\nThe fermented mash and the water    solubles\n  can be isolated out and form distiller feed for animals . \n \n\nFinally , the residues of corn i.e. corn cob and corn stalk can\nalso be used when it is being bioconverted to useful form .\n\n\nFor example , they can be used to produce furfural .\n\n\nRecently ,  scientists  are investigating the potential of\nsuch corn residues to other energy rich biomolecules for production of energy .\n\n \n\nI think that China can increase the value of domestic maize\nproduction by developing or even creating the market for the corn byproduct\nsuch as corn oil , animal feed or sweeteners .\n\n\nIt may be successful because a considerable part of the corn is being\nthe byproducts and there are a huge variety of utilization of corn products .\n\n\nThis method is justified when considering the situation in USA where\na huge amount of corn byproducts are produced each year and quite a large\nportion of income of the corn processing industry is derived from corn\nbyproducts . \n \n\n1. The wheat storage protein are mainly gluten protein which\nconsist of two types: glutenin and gliadin .\n\n\nThey are important in breadmaking quality because: ( 1\n) Protein are essential nutrients to human and the biological value of\nprotein to human depends on its amino acid variety because human cannot\nsynthesize certain kind of amino acid and that must be absorbed from food\ni.e. essential amino acid .\n\n\nUnfortunately the storage protein of wheat contain low amount of\nessential amino acid and so enrichment of bread with essential a.a. seems\ndesirable to those people that bread are their major food .\n\n\n( 2 ) It is the storage protein of the wheat that can\nform a viscoelastic dough during mixing with water .\n\n\nSuch viscoelastic dough has got the ability to form air cell that\ngives bread it s typical porous structure .\n\n\nMoreover , the air cell has got the ability to retain CO2 formed\nduring fermentation and N2 entrapped during mixing of dough , so the bread\ncan have its light and leavened structure after baking which is the most\nimportant eating quality of bread .\n\n\nThe  gliadin  protein of wheat is single chained and it gives\nthe dough the cohesive properties .\n\n\nThe glutenin protein is multichained and give the dough the ability\nto resist extension .\n\n\nWithout storage protein of wheat , such viscoelastic dough cannot be\nformed and so wheat flour cannot be used to make bread .\n\n\nThe reason that the storage protein of wheat can form a dough is not\nexactly known .\n\n\nHowever , it may be partly explained by the fact that the protein\ncontain low charge density and so the tendency of protein to \n repel  each other is low .\n\n\nAlso most of the amino acid in the protein are glutamic acid and \npraline  and the glutamic acid is mainly existed in its amide form .\n\n\nSo large extent of hydrogen bond may form that may probably assist in\nthe formation of dough . \n \n\nAs illustrated from above , it can be seen that the quality of\nstorage protein in wheat can significantly affect the texture and hence\nquality of the bread .\n\n\nFor example if the protein is not strong enough , it will be\ndenatured very quickly during the baking stage before the starch is\ncompletely gelatinized .\n\n\nIt is detrimental because the final structure of the bread is formed\nas a result of starch gelatinization and formation of starch gel after\ncooling , so if the structure of the dough ( i.e. the protein matrix\n) is destroyed before the starch gel is formed , the final structure\nof the bread will be collapsed .\n\n\nTo a less severe extent , if the structure of dough formed by the\nprotein matrix is not firm enough , the small gas cells will be easily\ncollapsed to form a large air cells during baking .\n\n\nThe resulting bread will contain coarse cell structures and that is\nof poor quality . \n \n\nOn the other hand , if the protein cannot be hydrated easily ,\nit will increase the time for mixing to form a viscous dough .\n\n\nMixing is actually the complete hydration of the starch and protein\nmolecules in the flour .\n\n\nAfter hydration , the protein molecules will form a complex , 3\ndimension matrix with starch molecules dispersed on it .\n\n\nTherefore , if the protein molecules cannot be hydrated easily , the\ndough will be very difficult to form and mixing time will be extended .\n\n\nIn conclusion , the quality of storage protein is important in bread\nquality during the whole process of breadmaking i.e. doughmixing fermentation\nand baking .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f4a353e3-fa74-4ab6-95d6-1461b4c46099", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.918571+00:00"}

Dubbed \" Memo Number Five\" , the\ndocument stipulated that systems under which officials were required to take\nthe blame and resign needed to be put in place .\n\n\nSince then , many local governments have already installed schemes to\nhold office bearers accountable . \n\n \n\nSection chiefs and department heads in the Longgang district in\nShenzhen , for example , can be removed through internal ballots . Even the\nXinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has recently implemented a similar system .\n\n\n \n\nAll eyes will now be on Mr Tung to see if he can measure up to\nthe rest of China .\n\n\nBut the chances are high that even if he does put together some form\nof disciplinary stick , he may not have the determination to wield it . \n\n \n\n Andy Ho is a political commentator  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Highway robbery as SAR tourists ` Go West '   \n\n\n Andy Ho   \n\n\nhoontat@yahoo.com \n\n \n\n THE 1,970-KILOMETRE  Qinghai-Tibet highway ,\ntraversing the world  ' s highest plateau , plays a major role in China  ' s\nhigh-profile \" Go West &rdquo; campaign .\n\n\nHowever , as travellers can testify , this lifeline of Tibet is\ninfested with gangsters - some of them , it would appear , in uniforms .\n\n\nThere have been reports of trucks being used to block the highway\nnear the Tibetan borders .\n\n\nDrivers are blackmailed into paying 100 yuan (  about HK&dollar;94)\neach , before being allowed to pass . \n\n \n\nThe local authorities are apparently aware of the problem but\nhave refrained from taking any decisive action . \n\n \n\nThree weeks ago , a group of six Hong Kong tourists witnessed a\ncouple of armed police officers doubling as \" highway robbers\" .\n\n\nThe group were among two dozen passengers , most of them foreigners ,\non a bus travelling from Golmud in Qinghai province . \n\n \n\nOne of the group from Hong Kong told me that after a bumpy ride\nof over 49 hours , they found themselves approaching the Tibetan end of the\nhighway , where traffic started to pile up .\n\n\nThey later found out that two trucks guarded by two men in\narmed-police uniform were blocking both sides of the road , leaving just\nenough room in the middle for small cars to go through one at a time . \n\n \n\nThe officers claimed that they were carrying orders to block\nlarger vehicles from using the road .\n\n\nIn reality , only drivers who handed them money were allowed to\ncontinue with their journeys , irrespective of the size of their vehicle .\n\n\n \n\nThe bus driver complied , but the group still had to wait for\nhours before the officers moved their trucks further aside .\n\n\nThey appeared to be worried that other large vehicles could take the\nopportunity to dash through without paying .\n\n\nThe two were prepared to open the gap wider when there was less\ntraffic approaching . \n\n \n\nDuring the stand-off , a public security patrol car drove by .\n\n\nThe tourists eagerly complained about the anomaly , to no avail .\n\n\nWhen they finally approached Lhasa , they were forced to stop again .\n\n\nThis time they were confronted by several bulldozers .\n\n\nA man holding a brick told them that section of the road was off\nlimits to outside vehicles .\n\n\nThe driver was worried the man would break the windshield of his bus .\n\n\nAnother stand-off ensued . \n\n \n\nWhat happened to the group is not an isolated case .\n\n\nComplaints about similar incidents have started to appear in the Hong\nKong press in the past couple of weeks . \n\n \n\nThe central Government has certainly put a lot of effort into\nimproving this artery for Tibet over the years .\n\n\nAt the National People  ' s Congress this year , Premier Zhu Rongji\npromised to earmark more state funds for infrastructure schemes in the\nmidwestern region over the next five years . \n\n \n\nFurther development of the Qinghai-Tibet link was named as one of\nthe three priorities .\n\n\nThe Qinghai-Tibet connection is regarded as crucial for easing the\nfinancial plights of farmers and herdsman in the autonomous region , who earn\nan average of less than &dollar;4 a day . \n\n \n\nEarlier this month , the Tibet authorities invited Hong Kong\njournalists to visit the region .\n\n\nIn a bid to boost tourism , local cadres even pledged to do away with\nthe formality for Hong Kong residents to apply for a permit to enter Tibet .\n\n\n \n\nTop officials have been enthusiastically mapping out long-term\nplans for Tibet .\n\n\nHowever , much of their well-intended efforts to attract visitors and\ninvestors will be wasted , if their security units cannot keep their own\nhouse in order to ensure a free and safe passage into Lhasa . \n\n \n\n Andy Ho is a political commentator  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Media must take stock after cabinet hoopla   \n\n\n Andy Ho   \n\n\nhoontat@yahoo.com \n\n \n\n THE MEDIA HAS  been peppered with speculative\nreports on who will become ministers under Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa  ' s\nnew ministerial system . \n\n \n\nSome of them have contradicted not only reports in rival\nnewspapers but also reports of their own .\n\n\nNews organisations will , however , get their report cards soon as\nthe line-up is scheduled to be unveiled this week . \n\n \n\nFinding out the names of the new ministers ahead of the formal\nannouncement has little to do with public interest as these conjectures are\nmerely games for competing journalists to reaffirm their professional\nself-esteem . \n\n \n\nThe fourth estate has been degraded into a willing accomplice in\nthe process by rushing to amplify unconfirmed tidbits in the hope of scooping\neach other . \n\n \n\nIt would be far more enlightening if reporters compared notes and\npieced together information they have been fed and the reasons for having\nbeen given it .\n\n\nThis would give readers a rare glimpse into how things work in the\ncorridors of power . \n\n \n\nThis , however , is highly unlikely under the pretext of\nprotecting the identities of their anonymous sources .\n\n\n Ming Pao  came up with a list last week , claiming that the\nnew cabinet would include 20 members . \n\n \n\nThe article was based on an account by a person \" who has\ntalked face-to-face with the Chief Executive on the subject\" .\n\n\nCiting unnamed sources a few days later , ATV aired a rehash of the\nrumours that the cabinet would be made up of 20 members . \n\n \n\nSimilar to reports carried by the  Economic Times  and\n Ming Pao  that day , the TV station also stated that Arthur Li\nKwok-cheung would give up his post as the head of the Chinese University to\ntake over the government education portfolio . \n\n \n\nThose reports yesterday were rejected by  Sing Tao Daily\n , which reported that the cabinet would have 25 or 26 members .\n\n\nThirteen of them are supposed to be new blood . \n\n \n\nThe paper noted: \" It remains highly probable that the\nChinese University  ' s Vice-Chancellor will replace Mrs Fanny Law Fan\nChiu-fun as secretary for education . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nBut the paper itself did not appear to be positive about what it\nhad carried .\n\n\nIn the same breath , the daily contradicted itself: \" Sources\nsaid the chances of Professor Li serving as secretary for education are close\nto zero . &rdquo;\n\n\nIt went on to say he had told the paper he would retire from the\nuniversity by 2005 . \n\n \n\nThe daily claimed to have obtained a name list , which showed\nthat incumbent Rosanna Wong Yick-ming would stay despite earlier reports that\nclaimed otherwise .\n\n\nIt further ran against the tide by insisting that Lingnan University\nPresident Edward Chen Kwan-yiu was still in the race . \n\n \n\nThe media , meanwhile , has reached a general consensus on who\nsome of the other newcomers will be .\n\n\nThe managing director of EHS Consultants , Sarah Liao Sau-dong , is\ntipped to become secretary for environment , transport and works . \n\n \n\nPatrick Ho Chi-ping , who heads the Arts Development Council , is\ntipped to take over the Home Affairs Bureau , while Pacific Century\nCyberWorks executive director Frederick Ma Si-hang looks set to become\nsecretary for financial services and the treasury . \n\n \n\nNow that the guesswork stage will soon be over , it is imperative\nfor the media to prove it is capable of focusing on the substance of the\nministers ' future policies .\n\n\nAfter all , the new faces do not have an established track record in\ngovernment administration . \n\n \n\n Andy Ho is a political commentator  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Bloc mentality casts doubt on value of Legco debate \n \n\n\n Party Politics   \n\n\nTsang Yok-sing \n\n \n\n DEBATES IN THE  Legislative Council fall into two\ncategories .\n\n\nThere are the non-contentious debates , in which no one needs to win\nover anyone; and there are the contentious ones , in which no one is able to\nwin over anyone . \n\n \n\nLegco is divided roughly into two blocs .\n\n\nThe media usually refer to one of them as \" pro-China\" ,\n\" pro-Beijing &rdquo; or \" pro-government\" , and the other as\n\" pro-democracy &rdquo; or \" oppositionist\" .\n\n\nThe blocs themselves prefer to call each other by more emotive names .\n\n\n \n\nMost Legco members belong to one of these blocs .\n\n\nThose who deny affiliation are regarded more often as chameleons\nthan real independents . \n\n \n\nDebates are mainly between the two blocs .\n\n\nMembers from either side can make passionate and forceful speeches ,\nbut they never convince the other side .\n\n\nNor is there ever any intention to convince .\n\n\nIt is widely acknowledged that no matter what is said , the\npro-government bloc will unthinkingly rubber-stamp any government proposal ,\nwhile the opposition will indiscriminately say no . \n\n \n\nSometimes , when Legco is dealing with an issue on which public\nopinion seems unanimous , there may be genuine discussion , apparently with\nno predetermined position to defend .\n\n\nBut the moment a government motion is brought , both sides\nimmediately polarise . \n\n \n\nAn example is the dispute over the civil service pay-cut bill .\n\n\nMost legislators , with the exception of a few from trade unions ,\nagree the salaries of civil servants should be reduced , at least by the\nrates the Government has proposed according to its pay trend survey results .\n\n\n \n\nAs to whether a law should be passed to make the reduction\nlegally unchallengeable , political parties initially showed a readiness to\nconfer with both the Government and civil service unions . \n\n \n\nMy party , the consistently pro-government Democratic Alliance\nfor the Betterment of Hong Kong (  DAB ) , raised doubts about the need to\nlegislate and whether it would be consistent with the Basic Law . \n\n \n\nThe groups habitually in the opposition - the Democratic Party\nand The Frontier , did not immediately reject the idea of passing a pay-cut\nlaw .\n\n\nBut as soon as it became apparent the Government was determined to\nlegislate to shield itself from legal action , Legco quickly reverted to its\ntwo blocs . \n\n \n\nNo longer was there room for open-minded deliberation .\n\n\nAcademic discussions gave way to uncompromising positions .\n\n\nThe DAB pledged support for the Government  ' s legislative proposal .\n\n\n \n\nThe Frontier turned inexorably against it .\n\n\nThe Democratic Party said it was willing to consider legislation ,\nbut certainly not in the form of the government bill , which it found\nunacceptable . \n\n \n\nThe Legco debate on the pay-cut bill will take place in about\ntwo weeks .\n\n\nNow that everybody has resumed usual positions , little intellectual\ncontent can be expected in the debate , which will be no more than a pre-vote\nritual , a final chance for the blocs to hurl accusations at the opposite\nside . \n\n \n\nIn many cases there is not even a brief period of rational\ndialogue .\n\n\nWith constitutional or political issues , such as the Government  ' s\nproposed ministerial system for principal officials , polarisation in Legco\ntakes place from the start . \n\n \n\nAs soon as Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa unveiled the\nministerial package in mid-April , legislators in the anti-Government bloc\nlaunched a vehement attack .\n\n\nThey called it a misnomer and a sham . \n\n \n\nThey believed it was Mr Tung  ' s plot to grab more power by\nremoving honest civil servants from top government posts and filling them\nwith his cronies .\n\n\nThey told the public it was a constitutional change that would make\nMr Tung a dictator . \n\n \n\nThey chastised the Government for the haste with which it tried\nto push the package through Legco , although they made it no secret they\nwould never endorse it no matter how much time was available for scrutiny .\n\n\n \n\nThey were disgusted with Legco \" royalists &rdquo; who\nnever seemed concerned about the Government  ' s disregard for the legislature\nor for due legislative process . \n\n \n\nThe pro-government members , however , vowed support even before\nthe details of the scheme were revealed .\n\n\nThey were convinced the reform would remedy existing defects in the\nbureaucratic system and lead to a more efficient and accountable government .\n\n\n \n\nThey had little patience for criticism from the opposition ,\ndismissing it as mud slinging or stalling tactics . \n\n \n\nThe oppositionists would not be satisfied with any answer from\nthe Government and fruitless debates would last as long as they were allowed\nto repeat themselves , according to the pro-government side . \n\n \n\nDivision into irreconcilable blocs is perhaps not peculiar to\nour Legco , but is it worth spending endless hours on debate if everyone\nknows it would only make both sides harden their positions ? \n\n \n\n Tsang Yok-sing is chairman of the Democratic Alliance for\nthe Betterment of Hong Kong",

audible above the\nsteady murmur of conversation .\n\n\nThe straight crowd on the whole was more differently chatting amongst\nthemselves , but there was a steady intermingling of camps , as Chinese and\nWestern boyfriends were introduced to and by husbands and wives , cheerfully\nunited in their determination to discuss anything but art .\n\n\nFrank was old enough to recognise that there were just rituals ,\nsocial unctions that had helped generations of strangers seem less strange to\neach other , but was still young enough to feel that he should take these\nmoments for their transients , reassuring worth . \n\n \n\nFrank noticed that there were quite a number of good-looking men\nin attendance .\n\n\nHe wondered who it was that said all good men were either gay or\nmarried , and why was it that he , on the other hand , frequently found\nstraight men attractive .\n\n\nPublic displays of machismo he found of course quite ridiculous: a\nswaggering John Wayne strut , ball-scratching , loud discussions of women ,\ncars , beer and contact sports in general , were beyond his ken .\n\n\nGrowing up in south-western Ontario , he had come to accept that he\nwould never be anything like the North American ideal of masculine\nattractiveness: the Tom Sellecks and Robert Redfords , and later the Mel\nGibsons , Brad Pitts and Tom Cruises , adored by women and gay men alike ,\nwere nothing like him .\n\n\nAs he grew , Frank moved beyond noticing the more obvious\ndistinctions , the blue , green , hazel eyes , the fairer , wavier hair ,\ndiscovering more subtle differences of proportion: the larger hands , the\nsturdier digits , the shorter torsor , the plumper butts of his Western\nbrothers .\n\n\nHe did not need a mirror to know that he would never look like them ,\nconscious of the distance between his reality and the ideals that shaped them .\n\n\nAlmost instinctively , he grasped for other trappings of identity\nthat he could use , and found a ready-made substitute in political activity .\n\n\nIn an era of AIDS panic , begin gay meant having a political role ,\nand this he embraced with alacrity , finding a sense of reassurance through\nprotest marches , rallies , volunteer work , all of which allowed him to feel\nlike part of the community he could never embody . \n\n \n\nPondering this , he found that he had been staring at a tall\nblond man not far from him , who was speaking on his mobile , gesticulating\nslightly with his brochure .\n\n\nFrank couldn't hear him , but gradually realised that his eyes were\nsteadily holding his own .\n\n\nInstinctively , Frank turned his attention to the nearest Shona\nsculpture , a free-standing head , face upturned , lips pouting as if\nstraining to catch rainwater from a drainpipe .\n\n\nPerhaps he should have described the lips more lyrically as preparing\nto accept a kiss , but - he looked again - no , she was definitely catching\nwater from a drainpipe .\n\n\nStaring at the silent head , he wondered how long he had been doing\nthe same to the man .\n\n\nHe recalled that cruising had become a big political statement in the\nWest , a gesture of empowerment through gay-identification that , as far as\nhe could see , would have been more honestly recognised as letching , a\nsimple movement of a man  ' s brain from his skull to his crotch .\n\n\nIn Ontario , this gaze had been practised with discretion , except\nperhaps for the lust laden crossfire that was a permanent fixture at Church\nand Wellesley , but then that was Toronto , a centre of political correctness\nthat sheltered that marginalized and reinforced their strangeness . \n\n \n\nHong Kong had come as a revelation .\n\n\nThe physical distinctions lost their force , and his need for\npolitical activity slipped away .\n\n\nHe found that he was now perceived as being attractive .\n\n\nHow thin , he thought , had his political gestures been if now he\nhardly missed them .\n\n\nTo his new friends he would remark from time to time on the political\nindifference of Hong Kong:  can you imagine holding a Pride march here ?\n\n\nNo one would show: all the queens would be down at Joyce , shopping .\n\n\n\nYes , he thought , I  ' ve sold out , we  ' ve all sold out . \n\n \n\nAnd even more perversely , he found that he missed being\ndifferent , a minority .\n\n\nHis friends called him a banana - yellow on the outside , white on\nthe inside - teasing which he accepted with good humour .\n\n\nHe would admit with a wry smile that it was a nuisance , nor being\nable to read menus , local newspapers , street signs , but the colonial\nlegacy was such that , under the city  ' s collective skin , there was enough\nEnglish around for him to get by .\n\n\nAnd he did , curiously , with ease .\n\n\nHe could not say that the locals were particularly friendly;\ncertainly he did not miss the irritating and how-are-you-today  ' s of North\nAmerica; people here were often rude , pushy , vulgar , but mainly\nindifference , the outgrown of a past they never particularly believed in ,\nthe temperament of yet another metropolis hurting only towards the future .\n\n\n \n\nSo , attractive at last .\n\n\nThis was something .\n\n\nHe wondered why he felt no accompanying sense of elation .\n\n\nIn an effort to correct this lack of response , he increased his\nparticipation in local pastimes .\n\n\nHe joined a gay volleyball league , and went with his team-mates on\ntheir group excursions: shopping , dim sum and even the dreaded karaoke .\n\n\nIt was during this time that he started dating Patrick . \n\n \n\nDating .\n\n\nHe could barley being himself to say the word .\n\n\nPatrick , however , the sturdy setter and captain of the team , the\nfirst of his family to go to university , earnest , closeted , believed\nunwaveringly in it .\n\n\nThe rituals of grocery shopping , holding hands at the movies , the\nquests for quality time together were absolutely necessary to him .\n\n\nFrank acquiesced , hoping that he too would grow to like these things\n, until about three months into the relationship , after a particularly long\nday at work , the last few hours of which were spent continuously answering\nPatrick  ' s calls and assuring him that there was no need to wait for him , he\ncouldn't tell when he  ' d be done , he  ' s see him tomorrow , Frank left the\noffice to find Patrick outside , standing on the sidewalk , waiting for him .\n\n\nIt was close to midnight , raining steadily and he could just make\nout the gleam of the umbrella  ' s steel shaft next to Patrick  ' s face .\n\n\nWhat could he say ?\n\n\nExasperated , ears ref from the consciousness of his own ingratitude\n, he said nothing , letting Patrick put his arm around him and pull him into\nthe street .\n\n\nThe streets in Wanchai were never deserted it seemed , even at\nmidnight , even in the middle of the week , but apart from the occasional\ncurious glace from the stoned expat kids swaying outside the 24-hour\nconvenience stores , no one took any interest in two men huddled under an\numbrella , an arm slung over a shoulder .\n\n\nHe  ' d noticed that the code of straight camaraderie here ,\nastoundingly , allowed men to walk the streets in this sort of embrace .\n\n\nWhere had this tradition come from ?\n\n\nNot the British , surely .\n\n\nBut then again , why not ?\n\n\nHow much did he really know about colonial customs ?\n\n\nDid these former rulers find , in the topical heat , satiated with\npower and gin , that sometimes the trappings of masculinity can be allowed to\nslide ? \n\n \n\nHe realised suddenly that the entire right side of his body ,\nunsheltered by the umbrella , was completely soaked . \n\n \n\n\" Patrick , where are we going ? &rdquo; \n\n \n\n\" Nowhere , &rdquo; he shrugged .\n\n\n\" We  ' re just ... wandering .\n\n\nJust walking around . &rdquo; \n\n \n\n\" Why ? &rdquo; \n\n \n\n\" What do you man  '  why ?  '  , &rdquo; he snapped , nonplussed .\n\n\n\" That  ' s what couples do .\n\n\nThat  ' s dating . &rdquo;\n\n\nHalfway through this retort , Frank had started heaving a deep sign ,\nwhich only seemed to further incense Patrick .\n\n\n\" What  ' s the matter with you ?\n\n\nI  ' ve been waiting for you for hours .\n\n\nI come to pick you up .\n\n\nCan't you just do this for me ? &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThis was ridiculous .\n\n\nSo , underneath the hetero front , just another hysterical queen .\n\n\nWhat was the point of telling him that these rituals were stupid ?\n\n\nFor fuck  ' s sake , you  ' re gay , he wanted to scream , you have a\nchoice ,  we  have a choice: why would we want to be , no , \npretend  to be a straight couple ?\n\n\nWhy would you want to imitate the lives of the people who leer at and\nostracise you , who regard you as freaks , or pretend you don't exist ? \n\n \n\nThe umbrella was on the pavement .\n\n\nThey were both drenched , rivulets of water streaming down their\nfaces , blinking fury at each other . \n\n \n\n\" I can't do this anymore , Patrick .\n\n\nIt  ' s just .. . not working out for me . &rdquo; \n\n \n\n\" What you really need is a gweilo . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nWhere the hell did that come from ?\n\n\nPatrick had not stopped glowering , and a tremble was just detectable\nin his voice as he continued , \" What you need is a gweilo boyfriend\nbecause either you really are just a gweilo , even as you try to deny it... .\n&rdquo; He paused .\n\n\nThen , unblinking , fired point blank: \" .. . or you really\ndon't like who you are , and haven't got the guts to face it .\n\n\nYou hate being one of us .\n\n\nAnd you hate yourself . &rdquo;\n\n\nWith that Patrick pushed past him and lurched down the street , into\nthe downpour and darkness . \n\n \n\n\" It  ' s quite nice , this one . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe vision had spoken .\n\n\nFrank looked up from the silent head and regarded the smiling one\nlooking down at him .\n\n\nHe noticed that the man  ' s eyebrows were even blonder than the hair\non his head , curving upwards at the bridge of his nose , and together with\nthe sight crooked smile , gave him a look of wry amusement .\n\n\nA South African , he  ' s seen it all before , his name was Jan , what\nwas his ?\n\n\nAnd how did he like the art ?\n\n\nFrank smiled at the distinctive shape of the Afrikaner vowels and\nsaid he hadn't seen this sort of thing before , so it was new to him , quite\ninteresting , he supposed .\n\n\n\" I  ' m not really qualified to judge , I  ' m afraid , &rdquo;\nhe ended , smiling .\n\n\nAh , humility , modesty , deferral .\n\n\nRemembering Patrick , his throat tightened with shame .\n\n\nWhat was worse , it seemed to work .\n\n\nA further distracted stroll around the gallery led to an invitation\nto join him for dinner .\n\n\n\" I don't usually do this , but my boyfriend is out of town on\nbusiness , &rdquo; he added .\n\n\nFrank had a choice then , a choice to take the high moral ground and\ndecline , or to give in to the stirring in his pants .\n\n\nAt such moments time does not stand still , as the clich\u00e9 goes.\n\n\nNor does one hear alarm bells , which is another one .\n\n\nFrank felt himself attempting to map what the implications of his\nanswer would be .\n\n\nBut Jan  ' s face , its expression , was all that he was conscious of\n, apart from the alarming clarity of his own breathing , the short ,\nresonating breaths that he tried to suppress but was sure could be heard .\n\n\n \n\n\" I understand , &rdquo; he replied , understanding only\nthat a pact had been agreed tom a measure of separate consciences , both now\nput aside . \n\n \n\nLater he would remember from that night only short , shape\nimages of Jan  ' s body , hirsute and long-limbed , damp with sweat .\n\n\nHow the same expression of furrowed intensity , in different\npositions , from different angles , seemed to make him different men: one of\nthe charms of an unfamiliar body .\n\n\nLater Jan became vaguely engrossed with examining him , explaining\nthat he thought all Chinese men were uncut .\n\n\n\" Lapsed Christian , &rdquo; Frank replied .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "463f65d6-eb72-49db-bdf2-6f21e06f9c39", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.921342+00:00"}

{"text": "I .\n\n\nIntroduction  \n\n\n  The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life  , first published\nin 1912 , adopted the method of in-depth examination of one good case\n( in Australian totem clan ) in order to develop a thesis .\n\n\nAs a functionalist ,   Durkheim  mainly\nstudied the Australian totemism and it functions .\n\n\nNow I will try to have a brief look at these aspects and try to apply\nhis view of the point concerning to function of religion to modern societies\nespecially in Hong Kong . \n\n\n II . Definition of Religion \n\n\n Firstly   Durkheim  divided all societies into\ntwo world .  \n\n\n\" . . in the present day just as much as in the past , we see\nsociety constantly sacred things out of ordinary ones . &rdquo;  \n\n\nOne was sacred world in which the things were considered superior\ndignity and power to profane which meant our daily life .\n\n\nThe profane things should not touch the sacred things which also\ncannot touch with impunity so that these two world are not able to\ncommunicate with each other . \n\n\n There are two different religious phenomena which are beliefs and rites .\n\n\n\" The first are states of opinion , and consist in\npresentations&semi; the second are determined modes of action &rdquo; \n\n\n Church is a place where a group of believers gather together to carry out\nthe regular religious ceremonials .\n\n\nWhen they are in the church , they feel in contact with higher forces .\n\n\nThe reason for this , according to Durkheim  ' s explanation ,\nceremonials take people from profane into scared world . \n\n\n From the above-mentioned Durkheim  ' s assumption , there are the\ninteraction between the sacred things   ,  ritual , beliefs\nand church .\n\n\nSo the definition from Durkheim is :\n\n\n  \" A religion is a unified system of beliefs and\npractices relative to sacred things , that is to say , things set apart and\nforbidden - beliefs and practises which unit into one single moral community\ncalled a church all those who adhere to them . &rdquo;\n\n\n  \n\n\n The reason why Durkheim did not use supernatural or God to definite\nreligion is that some religions have no God or supernatural but they only\nhave some orthodox principles .\n\n\nFor example Buddish , they have four gospels but they have no god or\nsupernatural . \n\n\n  III . Brief look at totemism of Durkheim  ' s ideas \n\n\n\n Durkheim believed that totemism was the simplest religion in the world .\n\n\nThe reason why totemism is religion that the beliefs and rites are\nsame as other religion but the difference of totemism with other religion is\nprimitive and simplest religion .\n\n\nDurkheim firstly study and analysis the simplest and primitive\norganisation and religion .\n\n\nFrom his study , totemism revealed the characteristics or essence of\nreligion which could extend and apply to other religions .\n\n\nAs a result , he based on these to set up his religious theory . \n\n\n The basic concept of totemism is the identity it established for the clan .\n\n\nThe members of clan have not blood relationship but they still\nconsidered themselves united by a bond kinship .\n\n\nIt is because they relate themselves to one kind of animal or plant\n( totem ) which is represented their clan .\n\n\nThey share the name of the totem to identify their own\ncharacteristics from other clans .\n\n\nBesides , the totem of clan , there are other types of totemism such\nas individual totem . \n\n\n A totem is a sacred thing which symbolizes two different sort of things ,\nthat is the visible form of god and their clan .\n\n\nIt is at once the symbol of god and of the society .\n\n\nDurkheim suggests that in worshipping god , men are in fact\nworshipping society .\n\n\nSociety is the real object of religious veneration .\n\n\nThe reason for why man does not simply worship society itself but\nworships a sacred symbol like a totem is that it is easier for him to\nvisualize and direct his feeling of awe toward a symbol than toward so\ncomplex a things as a clan . \n\n\n Durkheim explains that in the primitive clan , the members have religious\nceremonials to worship the totem which is a sacred thing .\n\n\nWithin these ceremonials , people feel excited through the song and\ndancing and they cannot control themselves .\n\n\nAt the time , they only feel that they are dominated by a sort of\neternal power which may be the god or totem or supernatural and they are\nseemed to transfer form their moral and daily world into the different world .\n\n\nAccording to Durkheim this sort of eternal power is from the\ngathering of the members - society power . \n\n\n The religious ceremonials of totem can group the members of clan together\nwho live separately at the definite time regularly .\n\n\nTotem as the symbol of their clan , can serve the members to express\ntheir feelings of dependence on each other and their moral identity .\n\n\nAccording to Durkheim , people must follow the rules or laws which\nthey think that it is sacred principles .\n\n\nIn fact , these sacred principles just is the rules or regulations of\nsociety so that the society can carry out normally and prosperously .\n\n\nTherefore society can bind the people together and regulate the\nbehaviour of people through the religion . \n\n\n  IV . Religion Function  \n\n\n Durkheim as a functionalist concerned with the contribution religion\nmakes to meet the function prerequisites or basic needs of society .\n\n\nFrom thesis perspective society requires a certain degree of social\nsolidarity , value consensus , harmony and integration between its parts .\n\n\nTherefore Durkheim analyses religion which has three main functions :\n\n\n1. social solidarity ,\n\n\n2. regulating social relationships and maintain the social order ,\n\n\n3. moral authority . \n\n\n 1. Social Solidarity :\n\n\nBeliefs and rites performed by religion can encourage people to\ncommunicate their ideas and sentiment .\n\n\nReligion can group people together .\n\n\nThe believers are called to participate in some religious ceremonials\nat definite time .\n\n\nReligion provides a union in which people have the some religious\nbeliefs and the same value .\n\n\nTherefore it can strengthen social bond . \n\n\n 2. Maintain the Social Order :\n\n\nAccording to Durkheim , rites can regulate the social relationship\nand maintain the social order .  \n\n\n The Different types of rites are contributed to regulate the\nbehaviour of people and maintain social order &rdquo;  \n\n\n The different sorts of rites achieve the ends - maintaining the stability\nof society through the religious taboo .\n\n\nFor example , in some clans in Australia , when a man died , his wife\nand his brothers  '  wives should reticence .\n\n\nAnd even the members of the clans cannot eat the plants or animals\nwhich are the totem of the dead man .\n\n\nThat is some totem taboo for the member of clan to follow so that it\ncan inflect the people who are respect to the dead man through the religious\nrites .\n\n\nThus we can see that the rites can regulate the behaviour of people\nwho can follow the different kinds of rites in different conditions such as\nfuneral or marriages .\n\n\nAs a result , under the taboo of religion , the social order can be\nmaintained . \n\n\n 3. Moral authority :\n\n\nReligion may provoke the change of society .\n\n\nThe value of religion enact some standard of morality in the society .\n\n\nFor example , 60  ' s in the 20 century , people struggled for the\nright of citizen and the anti-war movement which were based on the religious\nbeliefs : the peace and the close-relationship with each person .\n\n\nPeople use the religious value as the moral standard to examine the\nexisting social system .\n\n\nIf they find that there is something unreasonable , they may\nchallenge the society according to the moral authority - religion . \n\n\n The above-mentioned functions are beneficial in integrating the\nindividual into society .\n\n\nAccording to Durkheim ,  \" . . moral control of the will\ncould lead to a flowering of the individual within a supportive social order . .\n&rdquo; \n\n\nTherefore religion as moral control can help to maintain the\nsolidarity of society and social order . \n\n\n  V . Try to apply religion function to modern societies\n \n\n\n Durkheim  ' s view of religion functions sometimes can apply to modern\nsocieties appropriately but sometimes it cannot .\n\n\nIn fact , in modern societies , most of religions would have their\nown moral beliefs .\n\n\nAlthough different religions have different origins and doctrines ,\ntheir main moral beliefs such as equality , freedom , love , kindness ,\nhelpfulness and so forth .\n\n\nThus , it become a moral authority which can strengthen social bonds\nand regulate social relationship . \n\n\n Totem symbols the supernatural of the member of the clan on the surface\nbut , according to Durkheim , totem symbols the societies which are\nworshipped by the believes .\n\n\nBesides , the Chinese Religions in Hong Kong , there are some symbols\nrepresented the supernatural/god such as the figure of Wong Tai Sin in the\nWong Tai Sin Temple .\n\n\nFrom this mention , that is similar to the totem as the symbols .\n\n\nCertainly , the two religions ( Totem and Chinese Religions\n) are the sacred things which cannot be touched by the impure things .\n\n\n\n The relationship between the totem and the Chinese religion is that totem\naffects the development Chinese religions .\n\n\nIn the primitive age , some Chinese clans use some objects which are\nsacred thing to represented their god or their clans .\n\n\nFor example , some clans in Sichuan , the member of the clans use\n\" white rock &rdquo; as totem represent their supernatural .\n\n\nTheir aim at worshipping the \" white rock &rdquo; is to expect\ntheir supernatural to protect them .\n\n\nIn my opinion , the totem religion affects the development of Chinese\nreligions . \n\n\n I try to apply Durkheim  ' s ideas in some Chinese religion in Hong Kong .\n\n\nI cited Bun Festivals in Cheung Chu as example in which his ideas can\napply . \n\n\n I explain that the aim of this festivals is to feed and pacify the\nwandering spirits of dead , which will bring diseases and misfortune to a\ncommunity .\n\n\nThrough the festivals , inhabitants and the society will be harmony\nin the island . \n\n\n These festivals that involves a series of religious rites and elaboration\nrites within 3 days is carried out at the middle of May each year .\n\n\nThey worship the papiermache figures represent their god which can\nprotect them from the diseases .\n\n\nMoreover there are some elaboration rites such as grand parade and\nscrambling of the bun towers in which Cheung Chu people feel excited just\nsame as the clan in Australia , where the member of clan feel excited through\nthe totem rites such as dancing and singing .\n\n\nAll people in Cheung Chu must attend the festivals . \n\n\n According to the above mentioned , we can see that this festivals has its\nsocial function to group people together and the aim is to give the harmony\nin the island .\n\n\nIn other words , it can strengthen the social solidarity in Cheung\nChu . \n\n\n But there are some Chinese religions , Durkheim  ' s ideas cannot apply in\nthem appropriately such as worshipping the Wong Tai Sin Temple or the rock\nwhich seem as a god of marriage .\n\n\nThe social function of this religion is that the powerful deities\ncan help people reduce their anxieties .\n\n\nIn other words , it can satisfy the individual needs . \n\n\n I cited worshipping to rock which represent the god of marriage as\nexample .\n\n\nPeople do not group together to join the religious ceremonials but\nthey worship to the god/supernatural individually .\n\n\nAlthough there is a special day for worshipping that supernatural ,\npeople do not go to there at the same time and there is no communication\nbetween worshippers during their religious rates . \n\n\n From the above-mentioned , the social function is different from the\nDurkheim  ' s ideas - mainly strengthening the social bonds .\n\n\nTherefore Durkheim  ' s thesis cannot apply in some Chinese religions .\n\n\n\n In small traditional cultures , according to Durkheim , almost all\naspects of life are spread by religion .\n\n\nThus Durkheim emphasizes the religion is the most important factor\nto promote social cohesion rather that other aspects such as education . \n\n\n However , many sociologists belief that modern societies are undergoing a\nprocess of secularization ( means that a process of decline in\nreligious activities beliefs , ways of thinking and institution that occurs\nwith social structural change . ) .\n\n\nOn the other hand , according to some sociologists , other\ninstitutions like education and economic institutions are increasing their\nsignificance to strengthening social bonds and regulation social relationship .\n\n\n\n  VI. Conclusion  \n\n\n\n From above mentioned , although Durkheim  ' s idea cannot apply to modern\nsocieties completely , he still has great contribution in sociology\nundoubtedly . \n\n\n   Endnotes   \n\n\n1.

' \n\n\n The show , which has applied for a place in the  Guinness Book Of\nRecords  as the longest-running radio drama , was created in memory of\nLam Bun , a Commercial Radio broadcaster who was burned to death by radical\nleftists in the 1967 riots because of his opinions .\n\n\nIt initially went on air titled  Under Restraint  and later\nas  An Objective Eye  before evolving into  18/F Block C  ,\nin honour of Lam  ' s address . \n\n\n His customers are from all walks of life - Madam Cheung (  Chu Shuit-mui ) , Moustachio (  Chan Sam ) , Landlord (  Yan Kam-wah ) , Aunt Toothless (  Chan Mo-yin ) , Uncle Tok (  Lee Kam ) and Uncle Junior (  Fung Chi-fung ) .\n\n\nThey gather at the shop to share their views on social issues and\ngovernment policy . \n\n\n When it was created in the 1960s , radio was still an important medium of\nmass entertainment and radio dramas were mainstream programmes , a wide\nvariety of which were adapted from detective novels , fairy tales and ghost\nstories .\n\n\nAt that time , Hong Kong  ' s people were struggling to improve their\nlifestyles .\n\n\nListeners were typically factory workers or housewives .\n\n\n'Landlord ' Yan recalls that living conditions were poor and the\naverage wage just &dollar;7 or &dollar;8 a day . \n\n\n As Hong Kong  ' s economy has grown , the locale has changed .\n\n\nOriginally set in a Kwun Tong street stall , Boss Chow  ' expanded ' his\nbusiness and moved to the fictional shop premises on the island in 1975 .\n\n\n\n\n Since then , the coffee shop has become a voice of public opinion , which\nhelps explain why it is so popular .\n\n\nIt has always rated as one of the top three radio programmes .\n\n\nAnd while most of the cast is at least 50 years old , many young\nlisteners also tune in . \n\n\n  ' Though many housewives listen to our show , we know that university\nstudents are among our regular audience too, ' says Chu , who plays Madam\nCheung . \n\n\n Students admit to listening to the programme for its informal and lively\nsummary of current events .\n\n\n'I have been listening to  18/F Block C  since I was a\nchild, ' says 20-year-old university student Yiu Kar-ming .\n\n\n'It keeps me up to date with what is going on in Hong Kong .\n\n\nIt never sounds tired to me .\n\n\nThe voices are so familiar . . . they  ' re like my next door\nneighbours. ' \n\n\n The actors spend one hour a day , five days a week , recording episodes .\n\n\nThey have been doing it for so long that they no longer need to\nrehearse their scripts . \n\n\n None of the cast remembers what the first show was like , but they recall\nthe hottest topics of the day. \n\n\n  ' Issues such as rises in water charges and bus fares were on the agenda,'\nChow says .\n\n\n'We have always tried to report the facts and bring different\nperspectives forward in a tongue-in-cheek way , no matter what point of view\nit is , be it the Government  ' s or the people's .\n\n\nWe aim to maintain a balance. ' \n\n\n Most of the cast has been with the show for 33 years .\n\n\nTheir voices are so familiar to the public that their radio\ncharacters have merged with their real-life identities .\n\n\nChow gives scriptwriter Tang Yeung-ko , who has been writing under\nthe pseudonym Tong Ling for more than 8,000 episodes , credit for this .\n\n\n'He  ' s the one who gives the characters their unique personalities,'\nChow says . \n\n\n While the show is always on the lookout for new blood , both writers and\nactors , few suitable successors have been found to form the next generation .\n\n\n\n  ' We always encourage young people to participate in the show, ' Chow says .\n\n\n'But mostly they don't fit in .\n\n\nIt could be because the show is about current affairs , and one must\nhave accumulated enough social experience to express a good script .\n\n\nSimilarly , without voice acting experience , it  ' s hard to do a good\nshow. ' \n\n\n Yan suggests that young people are not hard working .\n\n\n'Some of them have talents , but they are rather lazy, ' he says .\n\n\n'They do not understand the job .\n\n\nTake Boss Chow , for example .\n\n\nHe spends lots of time figuring out how to act well with his voice .\n\n\nYoungsters are just not willing to spend the time. ' \n\n\n Five years is the minimum amount of time needed to reach the professional\nstandards set by the show , he says .  \n\n\n To mark the show  ' s 33rd birthday this month , rising stars Victor Chen\nSze-hon and girl pop duo Twins were featured . \n\n\n  ' Considering they have no experience in broadcasting , the anniversary\nguests have done a great job, ' Chow says . \n\n\n  ' Times have changed, ' Chu says .\n\n\n'Young people are a lot smarter than we were .\n\n\nThey know more about the world .\n\n\nWe were very dumb. ' \n\n\n It is clear that the show is sustained by actors who love playing their\nparts .\n\n\n'If I didn't , I would not have been doing this for so long, ' says\nChow . \n\n\n He believes the characters ' enthusiasm for Hong Kong is genuine and that\nhaving strong emotional ties to the city is important to their performances .\n\n\n\n  ' Basically it  ' s the scriptwriters ' job , but if we do care about our\nsociety , it helps when it comes to playing the role, ' Chu says . \n\n\n For Chu , working on  18/F Block C  has changed her reading\nhabits .\n\n\nWhile she seldom read newspapers before she joined the show , she now\nsays she can't start the day without them .\n\n\n'I turn to the local news section to get an idea about what is\nhappening in town , then I read through the international news, ' she says .\n\n\n\n Yan says this does more than just help them act better .\n\n\n'Even though our scriptwriters have done enough research for each\nepisode , there can still be something wrong, ' he says .\n\n\n'We can catch mistakes if we know the facts beforehand. ' \n\n\n The cast hopes Hong Kong  ' s economy will prosper again as it did in the\n1980s . \n\n\n  ' More jobs and more opportunities are the things we wish for the people\nof Hong Kong, ' says Yan , who is looking forward to another 33 years in radio .\n\n\n\n  vivchow@scmp.com  \n\n\n 18/F Block C  runs Monday to Friday from 1.30pm to 2pm on Commercial\nRadio One  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Yesterday  ' s song\n \n\n\n In their heyday , they earned a small fortune and the adulation\nof many fans .\n\n\nThese days , Hong Kong  ' s dwindling number of Cantonese opera singers\nare forced to scrape a living in dingy clubs .\n\n\n Sherry Lee  reports \n\n\n<p    > IN THE 1980s  , Cantonese opera singer Lam Fung\nperformed to rapturous fans in Yau Ma Tei  ' s Temple Street.\n\n\nTwenty years later , he struggles to make an impression .\n\n\nOn a recent evening at the Yuet Wan Singing Club , the 58-year-old\nbelts out a cover of a song of one of his idols , the late Cantonese opera\nmaster Sun Ma Tsai .\n\n\nBut apart from a couple of die-hard fans , revellers continue\ncarousing , ignoring him even when he thanks them for their  ' big  \nlai see   '   : two &dollar;20 notes a couple of satisfied\ncustomers have placed on a tray next to his microphone. \n\n\n  ' I feel very sad, ' he says , after his performance .\n\n\n'Now very few people admire the music. '    \" I\nknow noting else but singing . I  ' m too old to start from scratch &rdquo;\n Cantonese opera singer \" Christina\" \n\n\n Lam is part of a dying breed of Cantonese opera singers who perform at\nplaces such as Yuet Wan , a  yuet kuk gou tan  , or Cantonese\nopera club .\n\n\n'The government has never promoted Cantonese opera and now people\nprefer to listen to Canto-pop, ' Lam says , adding that a handful of clubs in\nthe area have closed in the past few years , leaving only six to continue the\ntradition .\n\n\nWith few newcomers and existing performers in their twilight years ,\nLam fears the art form will disappear in the coming decade . \n\n\n It is not clear when singing clubs specialising in Cantonese opera first\nappeared in Hong Kong , but , according to several performers , including\nveteran Hon Wui-sing , they were a popular form of entertainment after World\nWar II in tea houses such as Koh Sing in Western district , which has since\nclosed , and Lin Heung in Central . \n\n\n In the 1960s , as television audiences swelled , some clubs closed ,\nforcing performers to sing outdoors , for example , in front of the Tin Hau\nTemple on Temple Street .\n\n\nHowever , a government clampdown on noise control in the mid-1980s\nforced many street performers indoors and prompted a renaissance in Cantonese\nopera - albeit a short-lived one - as restaurants started featuring singers\nin the hope of boosting business .\n\n\nIn 1987 , an opera-singing teacher apparently opened the first club\non Temple Street , giving refuge to those evicted from their outdoor spot and\nproviding a comfortable setting for fans of the music .\n\n\nSoon , others followed suit . \n\n\n By charging an entrance fee of only &dollar;30 a head , the clubs provide\ncheap entertainment to the poor and elderly - most regulars being in their\n50s and 60s who visit for either of two sessions: between 3pm and 4pm , or\nfrom 8pm to midnight .\n\n\nBut nowadays , many who frequent the clubs visit for the little\nextras management provides , instead of for the music . \n\n\n  ' To attract men , some hire young local or mainland women with no singing\nexperience to perform Cantonese pop songs, ' says Lam .\n\n\n'Others employ  katoeys  (  Thai transsexuals ) to\ndance and a few have girls in bikinis singing; some even take off their tops .\n\n\nWe don't like this , but the owners have no choice. ' \n\n\n Yuet Wan itself has tried to fan business by employing  ' hostesses ' to\nchat to customers , but still it often doesn't make enough to pay its singers\ntheir basic salary of &dollar;150 a day .\n\n\nTo survive , the club has asked its performers to become  ' partners'\nin the business , allowing them to buy  ' shares ' with the   lai see\n  they receive from customers .\n\n\nUnable to survive on their meagre income , which is based on tips ,\nmany singers have quit to find jobs that pay better , or have found part-time\nwork to supplement what they make . \n\n\n Lam , who earned as much as &dollar;30,000 a month in the 1980s , then a\nsmall fortune , now scrapes by on &dollar;4,000 to &dollar;5,000 .\n\n\n'Sometimes I make just &dollar;30 a day, ' he says , adding that he\nnow also sings at birthday parties or at other celebrations .\n\n\n'I  ' ve never thought of quitting , though .\n\n\nI love singing , and if I can earn a living entertaining others , I  ' m\nhappy. ' \n\n\n Lam  ' s love of opera started while he was growing up in Guangzhou .\n\n\n'I lived in a village and sometimes opera troupes visited to\nperform, ' he remembers .\n\n\n'The first time I heard it I loved it. ' \n\n\n  ' Christina ' , one of about 20 female professional Cantonese opera singers\nremaining in Temple Street , says she continues what she does because she\ncan't find other employment .\n\n\n'I know nothing else but singing, ' the 40-something performer\nexplains , adding she earns about &dollar;3,000 a month .\n\n\n'I  ' m too old to start from scratch.'\n\n\nHaving to work around hostesses , however , embarrasses her so much\nshe declines to give her full name or be photographed .\n\n\n'I don't want people to think I have anything to do with these\nwomen, ' she says .\n\n\nStanding in the stairwell outside the singing club , she gazes at a\nglass case holding pictures of her in her heyday . \n\n\n As part of the long-defunct Lai Yuen Women  ' s Opera Singing Troupe in Mei\nFoo in the late 1970s , she remembers the beautiful gowns she used to wear on\nstage . \n\n\n  ' I considered myself a singer and we only competed with our singing\nskills , not with our youth or beauty, ' she says . \n\n\n With a cigarette clenched between his lips , the bespectacled Hon\nWui-sing drums out a beat with wooden sticks , his mind appearing to be\nelsewhere .\n\n\nNext to him , a female singer wearing a tight blue top serenades the\naudience in unpolished tones . \n\n\n Things used to be different at opera clubs , he says after the\nperformance .\n\n\n'When I was six , my father started taking me to tea houses to\nlisten to opera .\n\n\nThey were so good to listen to. ' Father and son made it a\nthrice-weekly ritual , filling their bellies with barbecued pork buns for 30 cents a\nplate and filling their ears with  ' refreshing music ' . \n\n\n In 1987 , aged 36 , Hon left his job as a taxi driver to pursue his\ninterest in opera singing , but after the economic downturn claimed the club\nin which he performed , he returned to driving a cab and working part-time as\na drummer . \n\n\n Lam , however , can't think of doing anything else but singing .\n\n\nAs soon as he hears his name announced , he breaks into a smile and\nsprings on to the stage .\n\n\nBut while the red wall behind him sparkles with lights , Lam  ' s\nfuture is less than shiny .\n\n\n'Opera singing is a good art, ' he says ,  ' but no one admires it any\nmore.

Koreans , meanwhile , have a special\naffection for Monk Sha: the way he prefers to work (  or fight ) rather than\ntalk resonates with the country .\n\n\nJust as people have decided to instill  Journey To The West \nwith new meanings ,  Goku  will give the classic fable a modern\nsheen .\n\n\nLeather pants and boots are in abundance , while Great Moon Tang will\nride a tricycle rather than a horse .\n\n\nThe language is also contemporary .\n\n\nKo chuckles when the devils suggest that when they consume the\ncaptured Great Monk , it will be like devouring \" Sweet and Sour Monk\" .\n\n\n \n\nWhile careful of the dangers of turning a literary classic into a\nparody , Ko adds that  Goku  is \" primarily a comedy and the\nemphasis to create a relaxed atmosphere that will make people laugh\" .\n\n\nHe adds: \" There  ' s not just one way to tackle  Journey To\nThe West  . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nAfter saying that , chaotic , gag-friendly drama is hardly what\npeople expect for the annual high-art festival .

{"text": "Poll to gauge doctors  '  backing for pay package  \n\n\n\n By FIONA CHAN  </h \n\n \n\nA POLL of university doctors will be made in the next two weeks to\ngauge their support for a new remuneration package for which their\nassociation is fighting . \n\n \n\nThe results will be given to the Government to allow it to assess\nthe extra costs , which will be a major factor in the acceptance of the\nproposed scheme . \n\n \n\nThe cost of the new offer , assuming all doctors accept it , could\nbe as high as &dollar;100 million a year . \n\n \n\nThe move was decided after an emergency meeting yesterday between\nfive leading members of the University Medical Doctors  '  Association and the\nSecretary for Education and Manpower , Mr John Chan Cho-chak . \n\n \n\nThe number of potential participants will be discussed by the two\nparties at a meeting on July 22 . \n\n \n\nIt is understood the 209 university doctors will be asked whether\nthey prefer a package similar to that offered by the Hospital Authority to\nits doctors . \n\n \n\nThe association has complained about a huge discrepancy in cash\npayments offered by the universities and the authority . \n\n \n\nDoctors claim that many benefits are given as cash allowances\nunder the authority , and the difference makes it difficult for the\nuniversities to recruit staff . \n\n \n\nThe association has been battling for parity for two years .\n\n\nEarlier this week it issued an ultimatum that doctors would resort to\nindustrial action on August 1 unless the Government gave an \" immediate\nanswer &rdquo; . \n\n \n\nIt is expected that any new package would only be offered next\nfinancial year . \n\n \n\nAfter yesterday  ' s meeting , the five association members\npromised to provide the branch with \" further information required\n&rdquo; . \n\n \n\nAn association statement said : \" Both sides are committed\nto finding a solution to the issue as quickly as possible in order to avoid\nany confrontation in the short term , and serious consequences to clinical\nservices , medical education and research in the long term . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe Education and Manpower Branch declined to comment on the\nmeeting . \n\n \n\nMeanwhile , the dean of the Hongkong University  ' s medical\nfaculty , Professor Ma Ho-kei , yesterday confirmed that the intake of\nmedical students had to be cut by 10 in the coming school year . \n\n \n\nThe reduction means the university will have the same number of\nstudents as the Chinese University for the first time in 10 years . \n\n \n\nBoth universities will take 160 medical students .\n\n\nThe cut follows the Government  ' s decision to withdraw &dollar;300\nmillion from the &dollar;18.2 billion previously allocated to the University\nand Polytechnic Grants Committee for 1992-1995 .  \n\n \n\n\n Doctor fees in hospitals rise 20pc   \n\n\n By FIONA CHAN  \n\n \n\nPRIVATE doctors  '  charges in hospitals have leaped by 20 per cent\nthis year but clinical fees have remained the same , a Hongkong Medical\nAssociation ( HKMA ) survey has revealed . \n\n \n\nThe 4,000-strong HKMA claimed that a high inflation rate , which\npushed up medical costs , and inaccurate charge submissions by doctors last\nyear had led to the sharp rise of hospital services charges being reflected\nthis year . \n\n \n\nHKMA chairman Dr Leong Che-hung defended the high increases and\nsaid they had nothing to do with unethical charging , as claimed by medical\ninsurers . \n\n \n\nThe association said this year  ' s survey reflected actual fees\ncharged by doctors on patients in single rooms at private hospitals , which\ncould have pushed up average fees . \n\n \n\nAnother factor for the sudden sharp rise , the HKMA claimed , was\nthat last year  ' s estimated fees were exceptionally low because many doctors\ngave only rough estimates , therefore , a final adjustment this time made\nthis year  ' s figures look high . \n\n \n\nThe association also used the survey to defend its opposition to\nrepeated calls from medical insurers for the drafting of a fees schedule .\n\n\n \n\nDr Leong said their own survey was more meaningful for doctors\nand the public . \n\n \n\n\" If the range of charges ( in the fees schedule\n) is too broad , it will be meaningless .\n\n\nIf it is too narrow , it will neglect the complexity of individual\nservices and doctors  '  experience, &rdquo; he added . \n\n \n\nHowever , the new chairman of the Medical Insurance Association ,\nMr Nicholas Donne , insisted on its demand for an \" advisory fees\nschedule &rdquo; . \n\n \n\nMr Donne said insurers would continue their discussions with the\nHKMA on the fees schedule after the release of its own survey on surgical\nfees before the end of September . \n\n \n\nHe said it was not fair for them to comment on the HKMA  ' s survey\nresults but he welcomed its move as it was in the public interest . \n\n \n\nQuestionnaires were distributed to 1,946 HKMA members in May and\n648 people responded .\n\n\nThe survey lists a range of doctors fees , but only the majority 80\nper cent prices are presented to order to give a more accurate picture .\n\n\nThe remaining 10 per cent at the two extreme ends of the price\nspectrum were ignored . \n\n \n\nResults showed that general practitioners charged patients in\nhospitals from &dollar;400 to &dollar;1,500 for daily attendance while\nbedside procedure cost between &dollar;500 and &dollar;3,000 . \n\n \n\nSpecialists also had wide ranging charges on patients in\nhospitals .\n\n\nSpecialists charged patients on daily attendance from &dollar;600 to\n&dollar;1,500 , bedside procedures from &dollar;500 to &dollar;4,000 . \n\n \n\nUltra-major operations such as heart and brain opening operations\ncost &dollar;20,000 to &dollar;120,000 . \n\n \n\nPatients having major operations such as surgery on the stomach\nwere charged &dollar;10,000 to &dollar;50,000 . \n\n \n\nIntermediate operations like appendix removal cost from\n&dollar;6,000 to &dollar;25,000 . \n\n \n\nHKMA vice-chairman Dr Lee Kin-hung , said keen competition from\nan increasing number of private general practitioners contributed to the\nstable clinical charges . \n\n \n\nGeneral practitioners  '  clinical services on regular consultation\n-; including two days  '  medication -; ranged from &dollar;80 to\n&dollar;300 .  \n\n \n\n\n Academics warning on doctors  '  pay   \n\n\n By FIONA CHAN  \n\n \n\nMEDICAL research and training would suffer badly unless pay for\nuniversity doctors was increased , four top academics claimed yesterday .\n\n\n \n\nThe four professors from the University of Hongkong , including\nSenior Pro-Vice Chancellor , Professor Rosie Young Tse-tse , warned the\nGovernment unless their colleagues  '  pay was given parity with staff at the\nHospital Authority ( HA ) the standard of local health care\nwould suffer . \n\n \n\nMedical achievements pioneered by university doctors including\norgan transplants and breakthroughs in genetic research showed the importance\nof their work , the professors claimed . \n\n \n\nRepresentatives of the University Medical Doctors  '  Association\nwill have their second meeting with the Secretary for Education and Manpower\n, Mr John Chan Cho-chak , next week before a deadline for industrial action\nscheduled for August 1 . \n\n \n\nThey are angry at the difference in the remuneration package\noffered by the university and HA . \n\n \n\nThe university doctors say an independent study shows the\ndifference in payment between the comparable posts of a senior medical\nofficer , and a top medical lecturer was &dollar;600,000 per year . \n\n \n\nProfessor Young said the \" pillar &rdquo; of the teaching\nstaff would resign if the deadlock could not be resolved . \n\n \n\n\" I don't think there will be mass resignation .\n\n\nBut those of good quality and those we most need will resign, &rdquo;\nshe said . \n\n \n\nAnd it would lower the standard of medical training in Hongkong ,\nshe added . \n\n \n\nHead of Department of Surgery , Professor John Wong said the\nvacancies would be filled by expatriates who were of the same quality but not\ncommitment .\n\n\nThe 10 latest applications for a lecturer post were all from overseas .\n\n\n \n\nProfessor Wong warned : \" A large number of people are\nresigning .\n\n\nThey are people who will eventually take our places .\n\n\nWe will lose people in the middle management . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nHead of the Department of Medicine at the University of Hongkong\n, Professor Chan Tai-kwong , said the difference in the pay packages had hit\nthe medics  '  morale and he expected university doctors would resign if they\ndid not get a better offer . \n\n \n\nHe did not expect doctors to go on strike as it would harm the\npatients but they would simply look for other jobs . \n\n \n\n\" We are not only talking about 200 doctors .\n\n\nWe are talking about the best of the profession in public hospitals,\n&rdquo; Professor Chan said . \n\n \n\nYesterday , he also revealed the major achievements of the\ndepartment in genetics studies , bone marrow transplant and cardiology .\n\n\nHe said the University and Polytechnic Grant Committee would continue\nits exercise on surveying the working hours of university doctors in October .\n\n\n \n\nHead of the department of paediatrics , Professor Yeung Chap-yung\n, said four vacancies in the department had yet to be filled and five very\ngood applicants in latest recruitment exercises went to HA because of better\npay .  \n\n \n\n\n Cornea donations curbed by confusion   \n\n\n By FIONA CHAN  </h \n\n \n\nCONFUSION over the Human Organ Transplant Bill has led to a\ngreater reluctance to donate corneas , according to the head of the eye\ntissue laboratory . \n\n \n\nThe medical director of the Hongkong Eye Bank and Research\nFoundation , Professor Patrick Ho , said the laboratory had collected just 26\ncorneas since it was established in November . \n\n \n\nHe said the unsatisfactory response was caused by the common\nmisunderstanding that eye tissue could only be donated to a patient by a\nrelative . \n\n \n\nHe attributed this to vague reports in the media that failed to\nspecify the difference between live donations and organs taken after death .\n\n\n \n\nThe foundation was established 30 years ago and the aim of the\nonly local laboratory at the Chinese University is to collect top-quality eye\ntissue for redistribution . \n\n \n\nCornea problems can be the result of old age , injury ,\ninfections , inflammation , illnesses , scarring during surgery or\ncomplications from wearing contact lenses . \n\n \n\nProfessor Ho , who is also convenor of the laboratory\nsubcommittee , said there were about 1,000 patients on the waiting list .\n\n\n \n\nThe Human Organ Transplant Bill , which has still to be approved\nby the Legislative Council , is aimed at forbidding trade in organs and\ncontrolling the use of organs from live donors . \n\n \n\nThe bill states that the donor should be the spouse or\ngenetically related to the recipient . \n\n \n\nProfessor Ho said the bill specified that living donors should be\nblood relatives , but cornea patients only received transplants from dead\ndonors . \n\n \n\n\" I have come across many cases of requests being turned\ndown because patients  '  families were worried about possible breaches of the\nfuture legislation, &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\nProfessor Ho said he had addressed a letter to the Secretary for\nHealth and Welfare , Mrs Elizabeth Wong Chien Chi-lien , recommending two\nseparate drafts for live donations and cadaveric donations . \n\n \n\nHe admitted the &dollar;600,000 a year laboratory was going to\nwaste and could do more . \n\n \n\nThere were 28,075 deaths in the territory last year . \n\n \n\nThe principal assistant secretary for health and welfare , Mr\nDerek Gould , said the legislation was complicated and the branch had made\nevery effort to simplify it .  \n\n \n\n\n HIV victims in low payout fear   \n\n\n By FIONA CHAN  \n\n \n\nTHE Government  ' s move to set up a &dollar;350 million special\nfund for HIV-positive haemophiliacs was welcomed yesterday but some victims\nwere worried that they would get only a small amount of cash . \n\n \n\nMr Macleod announced in the Budget that the fund was for about 61\nhaemophiliacs who were infected by transfusions of contaminated blood\nproducts prior to 1985 . \n\n \n\nIt will also help finance a programme of AIDS-related education\nand publicity to help stop the spread of the killer disease . \n\n \n\nThe move follows a long campaign on the infected haemophiliacs  ' \nbehalf by the  Sunday Morning Post  . \n\n \n\nThe Governor , Mr Chris Patten , yesterday said he was delighted\nwith the additional help for haemophiliacs , who he described as one of the\nneediest groups in the community that deserved greater support and had been\nthe subject of a \" proper and sensitive &rdquo; newspaper campaign .\n\n\n \n\nNo breakdown of the fund was revealed and it is understood the\nSecretary for Health and Welfare , Mrs Elizabeth Wong Chien Chi-lien , will\nrelease more details on Monday . \n\n \n\nThe mother of Ming Tsai , whose plight came to light last\nDecember , one year after he was expelled from his school , expressed concern\nabout the offer . \n\n \n\n\" I am not sure how much will be offered to us .\n\n\nI read news that a boy like my son in Australia got compensation of\nabout &dollar;2 million .\n\n\nWe cannot say how much we want but it will be too little if it is\n&dollar;200,000 for each , as some newspapers have reported, &rdquo; she said .\n\n\n \n\n\" I hope he can have a small business when he grows up .\n\n\nHe is totally ostracised because of this misfortune .\n\n\nHe still cannot find a school place now . \n\n \n\n\" But I am glad to know that the Government has finally\npromised to offer help . \n\n \n\n\" I also want the Government to release details of the\nfund as soon as possible .\n\n\nWe just can not wait .\n\n\nOne victim , a small boy , is dying in hospital . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe chairman of the 200-strong Hongkong Haemophiliac Association\n, known only as Mr Tse , welcomed the Government  ' s decision but said he\nwanted to know more details before commenting . \n\n \n\nMr Tse said the requests from its members ranged from\n&dollar;200,000 to &dollar;1 million and they were set to have a meeting on\nthe allowance on March 13 . \n\n \n\n\" We planned it and requested the head of the Hongkong\nAIDS Foundation , Mrs Peggy Lam Pei Yu-dja , to offer help at the end of last\nyear, &rdquo; Mr Tse said . \n\n \n\nThe chairman of AIDS Concern , Ms Lisa Ross , welcomed the\nprompt response to the demands from the haemophiliacs and hoped to see a\ntimetable for getting  ex-gratia  payments and the development of\nsupport services . \n\n \n\nMrs Lam said she was delighted by the &dollar;350 million grant\nand had phoned the victims  '  parents immediately after the Legco meeting .\n\n\n \n\nBut she warned that the Government must take urgent action\nbefore the HIV victim  ' s problems worsened . \n\n \n\nMr Macleod also proposed a grant of &dollar;100 million to\nprovide payments to industrial workers suffering from pneumoconiosis , a lung\ndisease contracted by some quarry and textile workers . \n\n \n\nA &dollar;10 million fund would also be established to provide\nimmediate interest-free loans to employees injured in work-related accidents .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "4bbf44d6-a616-4a38-919c-7e8c1d7f72cf", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.932022+00:00"}
{"text": "Journey  \n\n \n\n\"   Ah tai gong   &rdquo; was how my\nbrother , sister and I called my great-grandfather .\n\n\nHe was a very well respected old man in the village .\n\n\nBefore dying at the age of ninety-four , he had had a rather long and\nextraordinary life , one that most people would like to live .\n\n\nHe had four sons and one daughter in two marriages with my \"\n ah tai ma  &rdquo; and another mistress in  Kam Mun \n, Taiwan .\n\n\nNone of his children stayed in the country where their father  ' s roots\nlay .\n\n\nThey went away from China to different places , and settled down in\nalien countries .\n\n\nI always ask my mother why they would want to go to those distant\nplaces , leaving their parents and wives alone in the village and never come\nhome .\n\n\nWhy would these sons  '  wives still wait for them after twenty , thirty\nor more years ? \n\n \n\nThe three sons of   ah tai gong   and\n  ah tai ma   went to the Philippines and the\ndaughter went to Malaysia .\n\n\nAnother great uncle is in Taiwan now .\n\n\nHe visited us once a few years ago .\n\n\nThough he is an illegitimate son , it is he who reminds me most of my\ngreat-grandfather , particular his rather slim and distinctive profile and\nthe very special long eyes .\n\n\nThey did not look too long , but they just had the right shape and\nsize to make them look charming and deep .\n\n\nThere were the rather fleshy and long ears that symbolize long life\naccording to Chinese   face-reading   .\n\n\nAnd that was all I noticed about this Taiwanese born son of my\ngreat-grandfather .\n\n\nI requested my grandmother and mother to tell more stories about my\ngreat-grandfather with whom I spent my first few years of life with in \nCalai  , while my mother was working in the commune farms and my father\nwas in Hong Kong . \n\n \n\nCoffee , cigars , wood carving and furniture making are my\nstrongest memories of my great-grandfather .\n\n\nHe always liked to make some coffee for my brother and me to drink .\n\n\nI still remember how his special coffee tasted and smelled .\n\n\nIt was not like any coffee I drink now , not like Irish coffee ,\ncappuccino or espresso .\n\n\nIt was like an almond coffee with milk &semi; it really had some thin\nslices of almond mixed in the drink .\n\n\nMy mother always complained when she saw him making coffee for us\n&semi; she hated it when he let us use an old man  ' s cup :\n\n\n\"   Ah gong   , it is not good for\nchildren to drink coffee . &rdquo;\n\n\nShe muttered that he should keep himself clean and take care of\nhimself first before treating these children to a coffee regularly .\n\n\nBut he would never listen to her &semi; he made some for us when my\nmother was out working or washing clothes at the well nearby .\n\n\nMy brother and I just loved it .\n\n\nWe treated it as a special drink .\n\n\nFunnily enough , I do not like drinking coffee much now .\n\n\nMaybe it is not as good as the coffee my great-grandfather made ,\nwith that lovely almond smell and smooth texture . \n\n \n\nMy great-grandfather always smoked a pipe .\n\n\nHe did not actually stop smoking at any time , despite his old age .\n\n\nI was not surprised because many men had this habit then .\n\n\nThey would not think of it as being unhealthy or harmful .\n\n\nMy great-grandfather smoked a pipe while the other men smoked\ncigarettes .\n\n\nI did not wonder at that time why he smoked that dark brown \ngrass  &semi; I wondered more about what he was thinking when he was\nsmoking .\n\n\nOften , he sat outside the stone bench outside the front gate of our\nhouse smoking .\n\n\nAll the brown grass inside the container of the pipe lit up with\norange light and became smaller and darker as he sucked the mouth of the pipe .\n\n\nThe brown grass was burnt and became dark ash .\n\n\nHe blew out the smoke through his mouth , which seemed to be easier\nfor an old man as it required less strength .\n\n\nThe smoke escaped and floated up on either side of his high nose ,\nthen flew to somewhere I could not see .\n\n\nHe looked very calm and relaxed , very thoughtful .\n\n\nI was then too young to ask what he was thinking about but I just\nremembered he looked as if he was thinking deeply .\n\n\nWhat would be in this old man  ' s mind ?\n\n\nBut now , I sometimes ask myself whether he was really thinking or\nnot .\n\n\nHe never told me and I never asked .\n\n\nSometimes , other villagers passed by and they would say \"\nhello &rdquo; to him and that was the only voice that I would hear for a long\ntime . \n\n \n\nIt was not until the last time I visited my hometown that I found\nout my great-grandfather was also a talented wood carver .\n\n\nI did not see him carve in those years , I only remember him making a\nset of table and chairs once or twice .\n\n\nHe skillfully shaved off the rough parts of the wood with a plane ,\nmeasured the size he wanted and he cut the wood into pieces .\n\n\nHe used rather thin wood which he would be able to cut apart easily .\n\n\nAfter he had smoothed the splinters off with sandpaper , he would\njoin the different parts of the furniture and nail them together .\n\n\nA shiny polish might be painted on the table after dusting and\nwashing the sawdust off .\n\n\nExcellent wood seems to last longer and changes to a darker shade .\n\n\nMaking furniture was not unusual for him even in his old age .\n\n\nHe had owned a furniture shop in one of the urban areas of \nFukien  .\n\n\nHe probably made most of the furniture for selling . \n\n \n\nAt the age of fourteen , I understood the artistic nature of wood\ncarving &semi; especially after taking a close look at his works that were\ndisplayed on the floor of the common room .\n\n\nI never saw them before because they had been locked inside a huge\nChinese cupboard in the dark and dirty storeroom .\n\n\nMy fear of mice and hatred of spider webs stopped me from searching\nin the storeroom when I was little , and that is the reason why I never found\nthose valuable carvings .\n\n\nUsually , each of these wood carvings had a stand to support it .\n\n\nThe stand  ' s surrounding frame was irregular in shape so as to make\nit more natural , like ordinary ground .\n\n\nThe stand was not very big , so it would not take over the dominant\nstatus of the subjects .\n\n\nThe most impressive one was that of a farmer and his cow .\n\n\nThe expression of the farmer was so real .\n\n\nHe had a kind smile on his face and was holding a rope that was tied\nto the cow .\n\n\nThe wrinkles , cheek bones , lip and jaw shape as well as fingers and\ntoe nails of the figure had been carved with great delicacy .\n\n\nThe clothes were realistic , with each pant-leg folded up to a\ndifferent height .\n\n\nHis shirt was quite worn out and he was barefoot .\n\n\nThe cow was carved with the correct proportion and the features\nresembled those of real cows .\n\n\nIts tail was swaying .\n\n\nIt was a graceful and realistic picture of a farmer and his companion .\n\n\nBeside this , there were a horse , an  Iron Buddha  and a\nlandscape of a hill .\n\n\nThese wooden carvings have remained in good shape -; no insects\nholes or rotten parts -; although some branches of the landscape trees\nhave become too old and looked as if they would drop off from its trunk .\n\n\n \n\nMy mother then took the carvings out , washed them , and let the\nsun shine on them for a day or two , hoping this would help them last longer .\n\n\nShe was doing it in remembrance of my great-grandfather .\n\n\nBut my father was a bit more practical &semi; he was hoping that\nthese carvings would become antiques and that he could make some money out of\nthem .\n\n\nBefore returning to Hong Kong , my parents told our relatives to take\ngood care of those carvings which were really quite old &semi; some were\nsixty or seventy years old already .\n\n\nTheir ages have increased by ten years since then . \n\n \n\nI remember that my great-grandfather died just one year before\nour journey to Hong Kong .\n\n\nThere was a big funeral .\n\n\nAlmost all villagers attended and they mourned him , but none of his\nchildren were there to see their father for the last time .  \n\n \n\n\n MY AUNT  \n\n \n\nI just received my Aunt Qi Xiang  ' s letter .\n\n\nShe told us about her life recently and about how she would complete\nher accounting course the next month .\n\n\nWe all congratulated her .\n\n\nMy Aunt Qi Xiang is 56 years old now .\n\n\nShe has one son , a 26-year-old businessman and a daughter who is 23\nyears old and is studying in university .\n\n\nMy aunt has worked as an accounts clerk in a grain store in a city of\nGuangdong in Mainland since she married a city man . \n\n \n\nWhen I was a young girl my mother always told me about Aunt Qi\nXiang  ' s life and character .\n\n\nMy mother also appreciated her .\n\n\nI love my aunt very much .\n\n\nI remembered that once my mother told me that my aunt had a\nfrightening experience . \n\n \n\nOne day , my aunt was riding a bicycle with a big heavy sack of\nrice tied to back of the bicycle .\n\n\nWhen she was crossing a bridge , she lost control of the bike and\nfell off the bridge into a deep , rapidly flowing river .\n\n\nAlthough she landed on rocks in the river , she did not quit .\n\n\nShe swam to the river bank using all of her effort .\n\n\nFortunately she was saved .\n\n\nHowever , her nose was no longer straight and pointed .\n\n\nShe now has a snub nose with a half-inch scar on the right side .\n\n\nShe always says , \" I have lost my only pride . &rdquo;\n\n\nMy aunt is kind and thoughtful .\n\n\nShe once asked for a week  ' s leave to take care of my mother while\nmy mother was recovering from minor surgery .\n\n\nShe likes helping people too , so she always carries sacks of rice\nfor clients . \n\n \n\nOne afternoon during a hot summer , my mother said she hoped\nAunt Qi Xiang could be in Hong Kong as she was good at making ice bars\nespecially milk bars and bars with red beans .\n\n\nWhen I heard that , I hoped to visit my aunt since I wanted to taste\nthe ice bars . \n\n \n\nOne summer vacation -; I was eight that year -; my\nmother brought me to my aunt  ' s home .\n\n\nWhen the door opened , a 1.6-metre-tall thin woman appeared in front\nof me .\n\n\nShe had a darker skin colour than us and her square face had some\nfreckles on it .\n\n\nHer eyes were small but bright , and her lips were thick .\n\n\nAlthough she had a plain face , she gave people a kind feeling .\n\n\nShe gave us a warm embrace and said in a low heavy tone , \"\nCome in ! &rdquo;\n\n\nMy first impression of my aunt was that she was smart and kind .\n\n\n \n\nMy aunt is kind to others but strict to her children .\n\n\nShe did not allow them to come late for dinner .\n\n\nShe also wanted them to concentrate on their studies and to behave\nwell .\n\n\nHowever my elder cousin always let her down .\n\n\nOne day that summer , it was time for dinner and my cousin had not\ncome back yet .\n\n\nMy aunt did not say a word and her face turned red gradually .\n\n\nWe knew that my cousin would not have dared to come home when he\nmade mistakes outside or fought with his peers .\n\n\nThat night , we all ate our dinner in silence .\n\n\nWhen the clock struck twelve , my cousin came back with dirt and\nwounds on face .\n\n\nHis clothes were dirty and torn ,\n\n\nMy aunt asked, &rdquo; Where have you been . &rdquo; \n\n \n\n\" In the street . &rdquo;\n\n\nMy cousin answered in a very low tone .\n\n\n\" What about your face? &rdquo;\n\n\nMy aunt asked .\n\n\n\" By my peers . &rdquo;\n\n\nMy cousin replied . \n\n \n\nMy aunt couldn't help her anger . She dashed into the kitchen\nquickly and picked up a knife .\n\n\nShe shouted at my cousin , \" I  ' ll chop off your ears .\n\n\nThey are no longer useful .\n\n\nYou won't listen to anything I tell you . &rdquo;\n\n\nShe came out of the kitchen , moved towards my cousin and raised the\nknife .\n\n\nMy mother ran to her and held her hand tightly to prevent a tragedy .\n\n\nMy cousin was frightened and ran out of the house as fast as an\narrow .\n\n\nMy cousin has behaved a little better than before since that\nhorrible night . \n\n \n\nThat was the first time I knew my aunt could be violent .\n\n\nShe did not regret her actions .\n\n\nShe believed corporal punishment was unavoidable and a useful way to\nteach children .\n\n\nHer belief may be correct because my cousin has graduated from\nuniversity and has a good job .\n\n\nHe always thanks his mother  ' s teaching . \n\n \n\nMy aunt can live leisurely now as her children have grown up .\n\n\nBut she is still hardworking .\n\n\nShe is aware of that she lacks knowledge .\n\n\nSo she attended a training programme provided by her store .\n\n\nNow she only has few lessons left .\n\n\nI wish she will have a good result .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "0107ed80-7b82-4dee-90fb-109e6c4c2e1c", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.933208+00:00"}
{"text": "SYSTEM DESCRIPTION  \n\n \n\nThe RapidGlass system is based on several major components ,\nnamely the clients ' access computers , the RapidGlass network , the  ' Dispatcher'\n, the secured corporate network , the  ' Auditor ' and the insurance companies'\ncomputers .\n\n\nA user on the client side enters information into a standard glass\nclaim form .\n\n\nThe information is then coded into EDI format by the client front-end\nprogram .\n\n\nAt the end of each day or at user-selected intervals , data are sent\nto the RapidGlass system via either intranet or internet .\n\n\nThe data are then saved on segregated client storage areas on the\nRapidGlass server .\n\n\nThis data needs to be transferred into the corporate network for\nfurthering processing .\n\n\nThis is done by an agent software that checks the presence of client  ' s\ninbound/outbound files at regular intervals and sends them to the corporate\nnetwork .\n\n\nThis component is called the Dispatcher .\n\n\nOnce the client data have been moved to the working storage on the\ncorporate network side on a DEC VAX computer system , the glass claims\nprocessing software that resides on it processes the data .\n\n\nThis program is called the Auditor . It retrieves information from\ninsurance companies ' mainframe computer systems and processes the claims .\n\n\nLarge amounts of information on insurance policies , coverage and\nclaim history are stored on mainframe computer databases .\n\n\nAfter processing , the output files are written for each glass repair\nvendor .\n\n\nThe Dispatcher is responsible for checking and moving the output file\nfrom the working storage to the RapidGlass server to wait for the client  ' s\nnext access .\n\n\nEvery time a client accesses the network , the Dispatcher checks for\ninbound files for collection .\n\n\nThe inbound file contains the processed claims and the rejects .\n\n\nThe client can then go back to each of the rejected claims and check\nthe error message for making appropriate corrections . \n\n \n\nThe Auditor also has built-in usage accounting capability .\n\n\nThe present system charges the insurance companies according to the\nnumber of claims processed .\n\n\nThere is also the possibility of charging the glass repair vendors on\neither a monthly flat fee or a claims volume-based charging scheme .\n\n\nThe system provider can therefore harness the power of intranet and\ninternet to provide a value-added service to the insurance industry with a\nmeans to support the running cost .   \n\n\nNETWORK DESCRIPTION  \n\n \n\nThree networks make up the RapidGlass system , namely the public\nnetwork , the RapidGlass network and the insurance corporate network (  see\nFigure 1 ) .  \n\n \n\nThe public network can take many forms .\n\n\nIt can be the worldwide internet or a private frame relay network or\neven the telephone network .\n\n\nThe RapidGlass system will allows three types of access to the\nRapidGlass network .\n\n\nThe first type is via internet into a firewall route then into the\nRapidGlass network through routers over frame relay , lease lines , etc. .\n\n\nThe last type of connection is over the conventional telephone\nnetwork , clients use modems to dial into Netware Connect or a Microsoft RAS\nserver and gain access node over modem lines . \n\n \n\nThe RapidGlass network is an internal Local Area Network (  LAN)\nowned and managed by Teleglobe Insurance Systems .\n\n\nAt present , it is a 10Mbps Ethernet .\n\n\nThe purpose of this network is to enable clients to connect and get\naccess to front-end resources of the RapidGlass system .\n\n\nSince this network front-ends external clients , it is a separate\nnetwork dedicated for the purpose of the RapidGlass system; it has no\ncorporate network resources and carries no corporate network traffic .\n\n\nThis network is managed by a Novell Managewise server .\n\n\nConnected to this network are the RapidGlass server , a network\ntraffic capture station , access routers and the Dispatcher work station .\n\n\n \n\nThe insurance corporate network is an internal LAN owned and\nmanaged by Teleglobe Insurance Systems .\n\n\nAt present , it is a 10Mbps Ethernet . Many insurance companies have\ntheir mainframe operations outsourced to Teleglobe Insurance Systems .\n\n\nTherefore , the corporate network provides access to many insurance\ncorporations ' mainframe computers .\n\n\nThe RapidGlass LAN and the insurance corporate LAN are two separate\nnetworks .\n\n\nThe only connection between them is the Dispatcher .\n\n\nThis has two interfaces inside the machine bound to each network\nrespectively .\n\n\nThere is no routing function in the Dispatcher .\n\n\nData transferring from one network to another are driven purely by\nthe Dispatcher application .   \n\n\nRapidGlass SYSTEM ACCESS    \n\n\nvia Internet  \n\n \n\nRapidGlass clients can get access to the RapidGlass system via\nthe worldwide internet .\n\n\nThey can connect to a local Interest Service Provider (  ISP ) to get\nonto the internet .\n\n\nBy using a web browser (  e.g. Netscape ) , a client can get to the\nRapidGlass home page .\n\n\nBy logging in at the RapidGlass internet server home page , the\nclient can enter claims information from there or pick up return information\nfrom the last processing batch .\n\n\nThe advantages of using internet as the access method include easy\nconnectivity , worldwide location independent and low communication cost with\nrespect to distance (  most cities/towns have Internet Service Providers\noffering local dialing ) .   \n\n\nvia direct access  \n\n \n\nDirect access to the RapidGlass network can be arranged by\ndeploying a router on each side , one on the RapidGlass network and the other\nat the client network .\n\n\nIn between , a number of data carrying services can be employed for\nthe connection .\n\n\nFrame relay , ISDN and fractional T1 are popular choices for\ninterconnection between networks .\n\n\nBy direct connection , clients have direct access to the RapidGlass\nserver .\n\n\nClients can log into the server and copy files directly onto the\ndesigned client area as required or use the RapidGlass internet server and go\nthrough the home page .\n\n\nThe advantages of using direct access are full-time dedicated\nconnection and usually a higher speed than a 28.8Kbs modem line .  \n\n\n\nvia telephone network  \n\n \n\nGoing via the conventional telephone network represents the\neasiest method to connect to the RapidGlass network .\n\n\nThe present implementation requires clients to use remote access\nsoftware to connect to the RapidGlass server .\n\n\nThe advantage of using this method of connection is ease of setting\nup .   \n\n\nRapidGlass SERVER  \n\n \n\nThe RapidGlass server is a Netware server that forms a platform\nfor hosting file/print services , Netware Connect and internet server .\n\n\nIt holds all the client accounts and filing structure to keep client\ninbound and outbound files .\n\n\nIt serves IPX (  Internetwork Packet Exchange ) and Internet Protocol\nproviding direct access clients with a choice of protocol to use on their\nroutes .\n\n\nIt also has an internet server to host the web pages .\n\n\nNetware Connect uses the multiple modem interface to serve clients\nwho prefer to come into the system via the telephone network .  \n\n\n\nDispatcher  \n\n \n\nThe Dispatcher is responsible for transferring files to and from\nthe insurance corporate network and the RapidGlass network .\n\n\nAt present , the activities of the Dispatcher are controlled by a\nselectable timer .\n\n\nThe Dispatch  ' wakes up ' every 30 minutes to check whether there are\nfiles waiting to be transferred and moves them , if required .\n\n\nClient  ' s inbound files are transferred from the RapidGlass server to\na DEC VAX computer on the insurance corporate network side .\n\n\nOutbound file destined for clients go the other way .\n\n\nThe file transfer is accomplished via FTP (  File Transfer Protocol ) .\n  \n\n\nClient work station software  \n\n \n\nThere are several variants of client software depending the\nclient  ' s choice of access to the RapidGlass network . \n\n \n\nFor internet access , clients can go through the RapidGlass\nhomepage or FTP files directly to their destined directory after a log-in\nauthentication process .\n\n\nCommon web browsers support home page browsing and data entry .\n\n\nIf FTP is preferred , a separated FTP program needs to be used .\n\n\nBatch files can be supplied to clients to automate the process . \n\n \n\nFor direct access , clients have the maximum flexibility .\n\n\nThey can choose to log into the RapidGlass server and transfer files\ninto the target directory .\n\n\nThey can also contact the RapidGlass server via a web browser and go\nthrough the home page .\n\n\nUsing FTP to transfer files is another option for direct access\nclients . \n\n \n\nFor telephone network access , clients work stations will have\nNetware Connect set up for dialing out to the RapidGlass server , then a\nbatch program to log in and transfer the necessary files . \n\n \n\nAll clients , regardless of their access methods , have a\nsoftware module that acts as a claim form front end to allow users to enter\nclaim forms into the system .\n\n\nThis module also allows claim forms to be edited when required . \n \n\n\nAuditor  \n\n \n\nThe Auditor program on the DEC VAX complies the incoming forms\nand processes the claims for each client file submission .\n\n\nThe successful claims and the rejects are stored in a file and put\nback into the client  ' s outbound directory .\n\n\nWhen processing claims , the insurance corporate network is used for\naccessing the databases on the insurance companies ' mainframe computers .\n  \n\n\nService pricing  \n\n \n\nTo finance the set up and the maintenance of the RapidGlass\nsystem , a charge by using method is employed .\n\n\nThe Auditor keeps track of how many records/claims have been\nprocessed for each Automotive glass vendor .\n\n\nThe usage of the system is billed back to the client on the basis of\nclaims processes .\n\n\nThis generates a constant revenue stream for Teleglobe Insurance\nSystem .\n\n\nThe charge per claim processes is low because the claim volume is\nsufficient and consistent .\n\n\nOnce an Auto Glass vendor signs up to use the system , the system is\nlikely to be used everyday . \n\n \n\nThe Auto Glass vendors also like to use this system because it is\nfast , cuts down on paper work and saves mailing costs .\n\n\nAlso , the claim forms are now checked by a computer and rejects\nreturned on the same day; this speeds up the claim process and allows\ncompanies to handle a large volume of claims .\n\n\nThe existing paper-based system involves a much longer turn around\ncycle .\n\n\nA more efficient claims system also means faster payout and improves\ncash flow for the user . \n\n \n\nTo gain access to the RapidGlass network , clients are required\nto purchase the networking equipment they put into the RapidGlass network .\n\n\nThe RapidGlass network access can also be structured into a revenue\ngenerating opportunity because different access methods provide clients with\ndifferent degrees of convenience .\n\n\nThe concept is clients will pay for an access charge to the\nRapidGlass network according to their access methods , but the back-end\nclaims processing charges will remain unchanged . \n\n \n\nThe RapidGlass network brings in connectivity from clients\nthrough various means , this opens up other opportunities in the future to\nadd services to the present offering.   \n\n\nSecurity  \n\n \n\nOne of the biggest concerns when providing services over the\npublic network is security .\n\n\nThe thought of host computers exposed to outside attacks and data at\nrisk is unacceptable to any organization .\n\n\nConnection to the internet immediately means the network will be\nopened for access on a worldwide scale .\n\n\nTo protect corporate network safety , the RapidGlass system is\ndesigned to gave a front-end RapidGlass network . \n\n \n\nThe RapidGlass network is physically a different network from\nthe insurance corporate network , therefore traffic on it is only for\nRapidGlass application .\n\n\nThe servers and routers connected to this network are also only for\nRapidGlass application .\n\n\nThe RapidGlass server only front-ends the client log-ins and offers\ntemporally inbound and outbound file storage .\n\n\nIt does not store any long-term customers files or records .\n\n\nIf the server does due to any reason , the previous back up can be\nrestored and no long-term data will be lost .\n\n\nThe inbound and outbound claims processes that day will also be\nbacked up on the servers on the other side of the insurance corporate network .\n\n\nThis arrangement offers a high degree of fault-tolerance for the\nserver and its filing system . \n\n \n\nSince the gateway between the RapidGlass network and the\ninsurance corporate network is held by the Dispatcher , the latter has some\nimportant features worth noting .\n\n\nIt has two network interface adapters: is bounded to the RapidGlass\nnetwork and the other to the insurance corporate network .\n\n\nAny operating system or application-associated routing between the\ntwo networks is removed or completely disabled .\n\n\nThe transfer of data from one network to the other is then left\nentirely to the responsibility of the Dispatcher application .\n\n\nThis transports data files between the two networks , even when\nfiles are transferred .\n\n\nNot allowing any frames to go from one network to another provides a\nstrong means of stopping illegal frames from accessing the back-end corporate\nnetwork . \n\n \n\nPast statistics showed that most security systems are\ncompromised from within the organization .\n\n\nIn the RapidGlass system , there are no users on the RapidGlass\nnetwork except the Dispatcher .\n\n\nThis is a dedicated machine , housed in a high security locked room\nas the network infrastructure equipment .\n\n\nThe other main source of work station connectivity to the RapidGlass\nnetwork comes from clients that have direct access via routers .\n\n\nIn this case , a registration system can pre-register the MAC\naddress of the work stations on the client side authorized to get into the\nRapidGlass network .\n\n\nThe MAC address list can be stored and monitored from the router .\n\n\n \n\nTo enhance security over internet access , a dedicated firewall\ncan be introduced between the internet access router and the RapidGlass\nnetwork .\n\n\nThe internet server can also operate from a separate dedicated\nserver . \n\n \n\nA network security capture device is on the network as a\ntrouble-shooting resource; it also records all the MAC and higher level\naddresses as they appear on the network .\n\n\nThis provides a mechanism to check all the users are legal and , if\nnew addresses are recorded , investigation can start early . \n\n \n\nThe possibility of virus infection has not been overlooked on\nthe system .\n\n\nA virus check server module is in place to provide a regular check\nof the file server for viruses .   \n\n\nSystem scalability  \n\n \n\nThe RapidGlass system can be scaled to support a large user\npublication by putting more servers on the system to the distribute the load\nwhen the number of clients increases .\n\n\nMore network bandwidth can be provided by segmenting the Ethernet\nand giving each segment its own Dispatcher or secondary Dispatcher .  \n\n\n\nCONCLUSION  \n\n \n\nThe RapidGlass system provides a solution for the present widely\ngeographically dispersed Auto Glass repair shops all over Ontario Province ,\nCanada to submit and process Auto Glass claims effectively .\n\n\nA large amount of paper work is eliminated in process .\n\n\nImmediately , there is less wastage and fewer problems in losing\ndocumentation .\n\n\nThe network linkage also defeats the distance between sites and the\ninsurance companies .\n\n\nBy computerizing the claims processing from the client  ' s end , the\ninsurance companies no longer need a large team of staff to process the claim\nforms that used to come in paper form through the mail .\n\n\nThe whole process is thus streamlined and clients get processed\nresults much more quickly .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM",

{"text": "The Star Forest  \n\n \n\nOnce upon a time , there was a small forest in a far country .\n\n\nThe forest was bright and warm , and many plants and animals lived\nthere .\n\n\nIn the centre of the forest was a huge tree .\n\n\nThe trunk was so big that it would take at least ten people to embrace\nit . \n\n \n\nIn the hot summer , animals from different parts of the forest\nwould to stay under the tree .\n\n\nThe shaded area was the coolest place in the forest .\n\n\nThough the leaves were dense , some sunlight still slipped through the\ngaps between leaves and fell onto the forest floor .\n\n\nThe specks of light looked like stars on the indigo ground of the\nforest .\n\n\nWhen the leaves wavered in the breeze , the stars on the ground\nflickered and shone .\n\n\nIn this way , people could see stars both in the daytime and at night .\n\n\nAnd this is why the forest was called the Star Forest . \n\n \n\nThere were many birds and squirrels living on the boughs and\nbranches of the big tree .\n\n\nGigi was a small sparrow who lived there with her parents and three\nbrothers .\n\n\nShe couldn't fly yet as her feathers were not completely grown , so\nshe always stayed in the nest .\n\n\nThe only thing she could do while waiting to be fed was to stretch\nher neck and see what was around her .\n\n\nThe surrounding environment was so attractive especially the stars\nthat shone below during the daytime at above at night .\n\n\nShe never felt bored . \n\n \n\nOne morning , she was looking around as usual when she noticed\nsomething moving slowly through the forest .\n\n\nShe watched this interesting thing attentively .\n\n\nFinally , it appeared under the big tree -; a large bird with\nvividly coloured feathers .\n\n\nIt had a long elegant tail of deep blue feathers with green and\nyellow eye-shaped patterns .\n\n\nMany animals gathered beneath the tree to see this extraordinary bird\n, Bibsy and Moxy , the rabbit twins , scrunched up their noses in excitement .\n\n\nThe white wolf , Michelle , who was generally recognised as a beauty\n, stared jealously at the charming bird .\n\n\nFurby the squirrel stopped eating nuts and gazed down at the lovely\nblue bird .\n\n\nEven Antonio the owl was awakened by the commotion . \n\n \n\nBut the bird was accustomed to receiving attention from others .\n\n\nHe walked forward without seeming to notice the other animals .\n\n\nHe rose his head slightly and fanned out the long feathers of his\ntall .\n\n\nThe animals chattered even more excitedly .\n\n\nGigi stared at the lovely bird .\n\n\nShe opened her mouth but couldn't say anything .\n\n\nThe beautiful bird then strolled slowly to another part of the forest\nand gradually disappeared from view .\n\n\nGigi heard somebody say that it was a peacock . \n\n \n\nFrom that day on , Gigi  ' s goal was to have the charming feathers\nand the elegant look of that peacock .\n\n\nShe imagined that she herself would become a peacock when she grew up .\n\n\nBefore long , she became able to fly .\n\n\nDay after day passed , but she still didn't look like a peacock .\n\n\nHer feathers were still short and yellow and brown .\n\n\nBesides , she found that she couldn't even walk elegantly like the\npeacock did .\n\n\nShe had to move forward in little leaps .\n\n\nShe became depressed .\n\n\nAt last , she became jealous of the peacock .\n\n\nEvery time she heard someone appreciating it , she felt annoyed .\n\n\n \n\nOne clear , cloudless night , Gigi couldn't sleep .\n\n\nShe lay in her nest and thought of ways to make herself as attractive\nas the peacock .\n\n\nAt that moment , she heard a wonderful song from far away .\n\n\nThe voice was so tender -; just like a mother telling a story to\nher children .\n\n\nGigi was curious so she left the nest quietly and followed the sound\nto its source -; a yellow bird singing in the branch of a small tree .\n\n\nGigi thought , &lsquo; it must be a nightingale. &rsquo;\n\n\nShe had heard a story about nightingales when she was small .\n\n\nShe knew that nightingales always sang at night , but she hadn't\nheard one before .\n\n\nShe couldn't believe that such a wonderful song could come from such\na plain looking bird .\n\n\nGigi hid herself in a branch of another tree and stared at the\namazing bird .\n\n\nIts voice was so soft but it carried a little sorrow .\n\n\nGigi closed her eyes and fell into the world of the song till the\nmusic ceased .\n\n\nWhen she opened her eyes again , the nightingale was gone . \n\n \n\nFrom that day on , the gentle voice of nightingale was always on\nher mind .\n\n\nShe wanted to sing as beautifully as a nightingale .\n\n\nAnd she knew that she should do something to make herself more\ncharming rather than just wait for colourful peacock to feathers grew out\nfrom her body . \n\n \n\nEventually , she got an idea .\n\n\nShe followed the peacock and paid close attention to his behaviour .\n\n\nShe secretly visited his home and tried to collect some of his old\nfeathers .\n\n\nHowever , even after several days , she was only able to collect\nthree of them .\n\n\nShe realised that it would take a rather long time to collect enough\nfeathers to cover her whole body and make a long tail , so she changed her\nplan . \n\n \n\nEveryday , she followed different kinds of animals and birds and\ncollected whatever fur and feathers dropped off .\n\n\nShe thought that with this method she would be even more colourful\nthan the peacock and she could get enough material to cover her body much\nmore quickly .\n\n\nAt night , she flew outside the forest and practised imitating the\npeacock  ' s movements and the nightingale  ' s song . \n\n \n\nGigi  ' s parents noticed that she always left the nest in the\nearly morning and returned very late at night .\n\n\nThey became worried about her since she still hadn't learnt to hunt\nor make nests and she was almost an adult . \n\n \n\nAfter a month , she had enough fur and feathers to cover her\nwhole body .\n\n\nAnd she thought she could successfully imitate both the peacock and\nthe nightingale .\n\n\nGigi was very happy .\n\n\nShe imagined that the other animals and birds would cheer and whistle\nappreciatively at her the next morning .\n\n\nShe then put the feathers and pieces of fur carefully on her body one\nby one using a honey glue .\n\n\nShe put different hues and different parts of her body .\n\n\nShe had a few long feathers from hens for her tail and some small\nwhite ones for her head .\n\n\nAfter many hours of dressing up , she looked down at her costumed\nbody and smiled with satisfaction . \n\n \n\nThe next morning was sunny .\n\n\nThe other animals had already woken up and were starting the day when\nGig appeared with her new look .\n\n\nShe walked slowly and awkwardly on her trembling legs .\n\n\nShe rose her little head slightly as the peacock had done and walked\nin front of the other animals and birds .\n\n\nAll the creatures nearby gathered to see this strange bird .\n\n\nSomeone asked , \" What is it ?\n\n\nIs it a hen or a cock ? &rdquo; \n\n \n\n\" Cocks don't have so many colours , &rdquo; another\nreplied .\n\n\nAnd these colours are all mixed up -; this thing is as ugly as\nturkey .\n\n\nNo much uglier then a turkey . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nGigi then fanned out the long feathers on her tail . \n\n \n\n\" Em ... must be a miniature turkey-vulture ...\n\n\nnow it  ' s screaming .\n\n\nIt must be mentally ill . &rdquo; \n\n \n\n\"   Its  feathers are so untidy and\ndirty ...\n\n\nyou can see it doesn't even wash itself . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nAll the animals were whispering .\n\n\nThey didn't speak loudly because they didn't know whether the weird\nlooking animal was dangerous . \n\n \n\nGigi saw her parents perched on a branch .\n\n\n\" What  ' s that ugly monster ? &rdquo; her mother said .\n\n\n\" It might bite someone , where  ' s our daughter .\n\n\nWe better find her immediately . &rdquo;\n\n\nGigi  ' s entire family flew off to find her . \n\n \n\nGigi was miserable .\n\n\nThe other animals insulted her and not even her own parents\nrecognised her .\n\n\nShe quickly flew away , the hubbub of murmurs and whispers fading as\nshe left the forest .\n\n\nHer plan was a complete failure .\n\n\nShe flew as far as she could -; to a green savannah .\n\n\nShe landed and tried to leap forward , but she was very tired as she\nhadn't enough sleep for a month .\n\n\nHer costume of fur and feathers weighed heavily on her little body .\n\n\nHer face was wet , but she didn't know if it was from sweat or tears .\n\n\nFinally she dropped to the ground beside a quiet river .\n\n\nWith difficulty , she stretched her neck and tried to drink some\nwater . \n\n \n\nShe was shocked by the image in the river .\n\n\nAn ugly bird appeared on the surface of the water and looked back at\nher .\n\n\nIts eyes were half-closed and irregular , mismatched feathers and\nbits of hair jutted out from its body .\n\n\nA gust of wind came and blew some of the ugly bird  ' s feathers into\nthe air .\n\n\nGigi realised that the ugly bird was her own reflection .\n\n\nShe became frightened and quickly stripped the extra fur and\nfeathers from her body .\n\n\nWhen she was finished , she found that she looked much prettier than\nthat monster .\n\n\nShe no longer felt upset .\n\n\nThough her plan had failed , she was herself again .\n\n\nShe had never felt so free .\n\n\nShe sang with her original voice and danced merrily . \n\n \n\nSuddenly , she saw Bibsy and Moxy running towards her and\ncalling her name .\n\n\nWhen they reached her , they spoke in unison : \" What are you\ndoing here ?\n\n\nYour parents were so worried about you .\n\n\nDid you hear about the monster that appeared under the big tree this\nmorning ? &rdquo; \n\n \n\nGigi didn't tell them what had happened &semi; she just followed\nthe rabbit twins back to the forest . \n\n \n\nWhen she returned to the tree , many animals cheered , \"\nGigi  ' s back ! &rdquo;\n\n\nWhen her mother saw her , she gave her a big hug and cried out ,\n\" Where have you been ?\n\n\nWe looked everywhere .\n\n\nWe thought you had been snatched by the monster .\n\n\nDon't leave the forest again , okay ?\n\n\nWe couldn't bear it if something happened to you . &rdquo;\n\n\nGigi nodded her head and felt ashamed .\n\n\nWhen she looked around , she saw that there were many animals and\nbirds around her and they were all smiling .\n\n\nShe could feel the warmth of their love and concern .\n\n\nShe thought that she was the luckiest sparrow in the world . \n\n\n \n\n\n A Dream that Never Comes True  \n\n \n\nMy mother came to my bedroom one cold , dark early morning and\nwoke me up .\n\n\nShe said , \" Wake up and prepare yourself quickly , your\ngranny has already arranged everything . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nWhen I saw my granny  ' s cordial smile , my heart was deeply\nwarmed .\n\n\nLooking at her rosy face and brown curly hair , I could see why many\npeople said that she looked like a westerner .\n\n\nWhen everything was ready , we began our journey to the Mainland .\n\n\nSince my granny  ' s brother and sister lived there , she often liked\nto go back to visit them and help them out .\n\n\nOn the way to the train station , I could smell the fresh air and\ntaste the strong , freezing wind .\n\n\nAs walked through the station , I took several pieces of luggage in\none hand , and I used the other hand to hold my granny  ' s arm as firmly as\npossible as I was afraid that I might lose her . \n\n \n\nWe took an old-fashioned train .\n\n\nInside , there were wooden tables and the chairs were covered with\nthick , brown leather .\n\n\nOutside it was still dark .\n\n\nI could only see a sea of scattered lights and the dim-yellow light\nof the setting moon that illuminated the compartment .\n\n\nI really wanted to stay awake and see the scenery , but I could not\nkeep my eyes open , and finally I fell asleep in my granny  ' s arms . \n\n \n\nWhen we arrived in Chungshan , I thought I was being put in a\nrefrigerator when I got outside .\n\n\nMy toes were frozen even though they were buried beneath a pair of\nthick socks &semi;

{"text": "HISTORICAL BACKGROUND  \n\n\n  History of Bach  ' s organ music  \n\n\n J.S. Bach ( 1685-1750 ) is the apex of organ study .\n\n\nHis artistic contribution to organ literature is very great .\n\n\nMost of his organ works can be found in two of his major periods : the\nearliest years and Weimar period ( 1695-1717 ) , totalling\ntwenty-two years , during which a large portion of the organ works , such as\nthe chorale-based works and free organ works , were written &semi; the Cothen\nperiod ( 1717-1723 ) , six years principally devoted to the\nproduction of secular instrumental compositions not involving the organ\nalthough the Great Fantasia and Fugue in G minor was created in this period .\n\n\nThe Leipzig period of twenty-seven years ( 1723-1750 ) ,\nduring which the mature organ works were made . \n\n\n\n\n\n  The role of Bach  ' s organ music in his time  \n\n\n Of Bach  ' s organ works in his early period , the most prominent are the\nchorale preludes .\n\n\nThese works constitute a continuation of the North German School and\nalso form the grand closing statement for that school . \n\n\n Samuel Scheidt , as early as 1624 , established the technical\npossibilities and artistic foundations of the chorale prelude &semi; he\nindicated that the melody of the chorale could be placed in any voice part\nand that even double pedaling could be accomplished at the organ .\n\n\nPachelbel ( 1653-1706 ) contributed the chorale fugue ,\na fugal treatment of phrases of the chorale melody .\n\n\nBohm ( 1661-1733 ) expressed the chorale melody in\nluxuriant coloratura settings .\n\n\nBuxtehude ( 1637-1707 ) treated the chorale melody in\nboth easy and complex ways &semi; sometimes the melody is stated very simply\nwith only slight ornamentation , sometimes he expressed the chorale melody\nrhapsodically in fantasias . \n\n\n\n Bach is the one who took the methods of treatment worked out by earlier\nmasters and infused greater imagination and color into them .\n\n\nHe raised the forms and the organ literature to a greater height .\n\n\n\n In his Weimar period , Bach paid much attention to the virtuoso style of\nthe North German school and expressed it in brilliant toccata passages for\nmanuals , long pedal solos , many different kinds of figuration , massive\nchords , dramatic pedal points , and improvisational and recitative sections\n( for example , the Prelude and Fugue in A minor , BWV 543 ) .\n\n\nAnother   prominent  element was drawn from\nItalian instrumental works : the concertato ( orchestral )\nstyle , in which there is marked contrast between thin and thick textures .\n\n\nIn addition , many of Bach  ' s themes built on broken chords suggest\nthe Italian violinistic style of Vivaldi and Corelli . \n\n\n\n Toward the Leipzig period , Bach  ' s preludes and fugues became more\nindependent of each other .\n\n\nEach part became longer , and both parts tended to treat the subject\nmaterial contrapuntally throughout and concentrated on one or two motives in\na consistent manner .\n\n\nA significant number of the later fugues can be classified in the\n < ? > ricecar </ ? > type in which the subjects are composed\nof notes of longer duration and a much less marked rhythm than the subjects\nof earlier fugues .\n\n\nVirtuoso pedal passages and concertato treatment does recur from time\nto time in later preludes and   fugues  but to a much\nsmaller degree than that found in the Weimar period . \n\n\n  History of organ performance  \n\n\n After Bach , the doctrine of organ music  ' s performance practices were\nnot awared until Mendelssohn appeared as a defender of organ playing .\n\n\nFor example , the Henle Edition and the Lea Pocket Scores both\nprovide a faithful edition of Mendelssohn  ' s organ works in which Mendelssohn  ' s\norgan works in which Mendelssohn made clear shurs which require the\ninterpreter to give a real sense of articulated musical sentences on a\nmechanical action keyboard such as the Gottfried Silbermann organ in St.\nGeorgen Church , Rotha .\n\n\nThis movement established an idea of the close relationship between\narticulation , style of performance and the instrument itself .\n\n\nAs an enthusiast of the music of Bach , Mendelssohn also performed\nBach  ' s organ works frequently in recital .\n\n\nMendelssohn  ' s organ playing and interest in organ music helped to\nestablish a new conception of organ building and of the interpretation of\norgan music . \n\n\n Besides Mendelssohn in Germany , Samuel Wesley in England who contribute\nthe revival of interest in Bach  ' s organ music  .\n\n\n  \n\n\n Samuel Wesley ( 1766-1837 ) , was a brilliant English organ\nperformer .\n\n\nSamuel Wesley admired Bach intensely and worked to introduce Bach  ' s\nmusic to the English people .\n\n\nHe published several English editions of Bach  ' s works . \n\n\n However , in general , the art of performing early music such as that of\nBuxtehude or even Bach was almost lost as attention was given to Romantic\npractices and invention .\n\n\nKnowledge of Baroque ornaments and registration was largely lost as a\nresult , both the triumph of Romantic   music  and of an\nattitude which gave little or no attention to \" period &rdquo; style .\n\n\n\n\n Because of different paths in the evolution of performance , taking place\nin different regions such as Germany , France , Australia , Italy and Britain\n, the performance of Bach  ' s organ works was also subject to this evolution ,\nas organists tended to play Bach  ' s works \" in their own manner &rdquo;\nwhich was very close to their individual school . \n\n\n\n Therefore , the evolution of organ performance varied according to\ndifferent countries , traditions and schools of playing .\n\n\nThe old German school recommended a solemn legato with standardized\nduration of note values while the French School in the nineteenth century\nrecommended an exaggerated articulation ignoring accents and strong beats .\n\n\nSome people even tried to adjust the old music to the \n\"   < ? > nouvelle </ ? >  mode &rdquo;\n .\n\n\nSome performers even thought of reorchestration the fugues of Bach\nand added a lot of registration , manual changes and varieties of pedal in\norder to fully utilize the newly-invented organs of the period and , in a\nsense , bring Bach  ' s organ music into the \" highest realms &rdquo;\n( meaning , of course , the current fashion ) .\n\n\nFrench Romantic organists such as Cesar Franck ( 1822-1890\n) and Charles-Marie Widor ( 1844-1837 ) , contributors\nto the development of organ music and to the extension of organ forms and\nregistration , had an influence on this style of playing .\n\n\nThe whole period of the nineteenth century was not favourable to\ncareful research and consideration of Bach  ' s organ works .\n\n\nStarting from the late nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries\nconcern for \" authenticity &rdquo; and respect for the composer  ' s\nintentions came into   < ? > prominence </ ? >  .\n\n\nOnly in the second half of the twentieth century was a clear idea of\nBach  ' s organ interpretation established . \n\n\n\n\n\n  Historical reasons on problems of the interpretation of Bach  ' s\norgan music  \n\n\n The late twentieth century has developed a fashion for applying the term\n\" authenticity &rdquo; with regard to performance of Baroque music .\n\n\nThis is the idea of trying to make the performance closer to the\nmusic as heard during the Baroque period .\n\n\nBut how is one to achieve this aim ?\n\n\nMany musicians and musicologists believe that the historical \"\nauthenticity &rdquo; should possess a foundation for the \" honest\n&rdquo; or \" loyal &rdquo; interpretation of a work . \n\n\n As Bach never made detailed notations  regarding\nregistration , articulation and phrasing , problems arise among scholars and\nperformers concerned with authenticity .\n\n\nHis flexible reticence creates a never-ending mystery .\n\n\nA larger problem is that Bach  ' s organ music has a mixture of\ninfluences which makes it difficult to decide which style is the preference\nof Bach and what interpretation is most appropriate .\n\n\nShould one take into consideration only French influences (\nGalant and Romantic organ and its registration ) , or those of the\nNorth German School , with the authentic organs of Bach  ' s time and the\nregistration of Bach  ' s period &semi; or even English influences , all of\nwhich are present in the music ? \n\n\n A number of recent scholars have collected research amassed over the\nyears by a variety of scholars .\n\n\nThus , present-day scholars and performers can save time and effort\nby making use of the fruits of their labours .\n\n\nExamples are books and articles by  Hermann Keller ,\n Frederich Neumann , J . Klopper ,  Peter\nWilliams ,  Marie Claire Alain .\n\n\nAll those researches have received the acceptance of the majority of\norganists , especially the English organists ( perhaps because the\nconsistent , steady and securely based on the research of their scholars\n) .\n\n\nAll the books and manuscripts become the foundation of interpretation .\n\n\n\n According to Bach  ' s pupil  Johann Christian Kittel , Bach\noften used his own works for the repertoire of organ lessons .\n\n\nBach frequently changed the notations , phrasing , pedalling and\nornaments and altered the music during the lessons whenever he thought it was\nunsatisfactory . \n\n\n  In C.P.E. Bach  ' s letter to Johann Nikolaus Forkel ,\nthe first biographer of Bach , dated on 13 January 1775 , he writes , \n\" Bach composed his keyboard works in two ways . \n\n\nThe first was to improvise at the keyboard and later  \nset  the piece down on paper . . . . . organists were often terrified\nwhen he sat down to play on their organs and drew the stops in his own manner . \n&rdquo;   \n\n\n The phrase \" \" in his own manner &rdquo; \" seems\nto cut Bach off from the common practice of his period .\n\n\nTherefore , Bach was never thought of as a \" typical &rdquo;\neighteenth century organ composer either in his own time or even in the\nnineteenth century .\n\n\nIt was not until the nineteenth century that different editions were\npublished , and scholars made the studies that produced further questions\nregarding Bach  ' s organ performance practices .\n\n\nExamples are the Peters editor Friedrich Conrad Griepenkerl , and\nAlbert Schweitzer  ' s romantic advocacy in the late nineteenth century and the\nearly twentieth century . \n\n\n  INTERPRETATION DURING THE TRANSACTION PERIOD BETWEEN THE\nNINETEENTH AND TWENTIETH CENTURY  \n\n\n Schools of interpretation style in organ  performances \nleads to another page of directions of organ playing .\n\n\nThere are much concern on \" style &rdquo; and the appropriate\ninterpretation of Baroque organ works . \n\n\n Generally , there are two pressing style in the late nineteenth century\nand the early twentieth .\n\n\nThe Romantic School in the late nineteenth century is very free .\n\n\nThey are free that they use more rubato , articulation , and legato\nphrasing than the organists of other schools .\n\n\nThey think that the interpretation of Bach  ' s organ music should be\nvaried , as it is going towards the twentieth century .\n\n\nAnother School is the old German school , which is the continuation\nof the North German school from which Bach  ' s music originated   . \n\n\nThey try their best to fit their interpretation into Bach  ' s\noriginality .\n\n\nThey bring in some detached , breathing points to achieve the clarity\nof each line ( the counterpoint ) and play the music with\nstricted timing . \n\n\n Starting from the end of nineteenth-century , organ performers have been\ntrying to find a way of an appropriate performance  .  \n\n\n\n\n\n  GENERAL OUTLINE OF THE ORGAN  ' s INTERPRETATION IN THE SECOND\nHALF OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY  \n\n\n Previously organists of the past centuries have tended to ignore\nperformance practices in other field of music , but with the growing \"\ncross-fertilization &rdquo; between musical disciplines , organ performances\nis now more strongly influenced by performance conventions in other fields of\nmusic than has ever been the case since , indeed , the time of Bach - the\nlast major period of musical history when organists were also expected to be\ninvolved in orchestral and choral music making .\n\n\nAlong with the rise of the \" authentic &rdquo; performance\nmovement in fields other than organ music , the vocal and string-playing\ntechniques has influenced modernday interpreters of Bach  ' s organ music in a\nway that has not been the case in the past . \n\n\n In addition , as far as authenticity is concerned , in recent years ,\nmany organists have tried to make their interpretations \" authentic\n&rdquo; with regard to the old German Baroque , in so far as they eliminate a\nlot of possibilities of registration which today  ' s organ can achieve &semi;\n\n\norganists imitate what they know of the common performance practices\nof Bach  ' s time and try to play very close to the style that Bach is supposed\nto have done .\n\n\nThis kind of interpretation , can be , in uninspired hands ,\nsometimes quite monotonous since there is often no creativity and thought\neven the performances can be justified by some written historical assessment .\n\n\n\n However , most significance of all , the French influences in the\nperformance of Bach is being concerned again after a period of being\nforgotten .\n\n\nIt is known that Bach was influenced by the French Classical composer\n( Couperin , Clerambault , etc. ) .\n\n\nIndeed the music of this period had been all forgotten until the\nsecond world war ( 1939-45 ) .\n\n\nSubsequently interest in it and detailed research has uncovered much\ninformation about performance practices of the time .\n\n\nModern Bach performers have applied these to Bach  ' s music following\nthe logic that  \" if it was done by those who influenced Bach ,\nit is reasonable to assume it was done by Bach himself &rdquo;  \n\n\n Besides of the above issues , nowadays several outstanding organists have\ngiven revolutionary and creative performances of Bach  ' s organ music .\n\n\nRecording companies have reproduced as well the previous performances\nof some earlier experienced and virtuoso organists and released collections\nof Bach  ' s organ works .\n\n\nAmong these organists Helmut Wacha , Marie-Claire Alain is also a\nmusicologist and has produced careful and detailed researches on Bach  ' s\norgan works .\n\n\nHer performances are very appropriate , honest , modest , and in a\nway , quite reserved .\n\n\nHelmut Walcha died recently but he remains an \n unforgettable  organ teacher and virtuoso master of the German organ\nliterature .\n\n\nIn his records , now a matter of history , one finds that he tried to\nincorporate some inventive ideas in the interpretation through the use of\nregistration , manual changes , articulation and tempo , which make him\noutstanding among organists and high spirits .\n\n\nHis realisation of ornaments , his choice of registration and his\narticulation are very interesting and  \n entertaining   .\n\n\nJean Guillou  ' s interpretations provide a kind of spirit and\ninvigorating quality which are often absent in some other organist  ' s\ninterpretation .\n\n\n Ton Koopman has a very animated interpretation of\nBach organ music too .\n\n\n( both of their interpretation will be included in the next\nfew Chapters . )\n\n\nHis organ interpretation in Bach  ' s free works are very inventive\nwhich probably no other organists had play in this way before .\n\n\nHowever ,   referring  to Koopman  ' s\nbackground , he is an forefront authentic performer .\n\n\nHe combines the authenticity , scholarship and personal\nidentification and insights together . \n\n\n In an odd way , Koopman and Guillou meet in certain points , although\nthey are coming from different directions and background ( radical and\nidiosyncratic respectively ) &semi;\n\n\ntheir interpretations both turn out to be very revolutionary when\nbeing compared with the tradition of Bach performance .\n\n\nThis criterion suggests another direction in the interpretation of\nBach  ' s organ works .\n\n\nIt is that , if one is able to justify a performance by careful\nthought and insights which are based within certain scholastic boundaries ,\nhis playing can be accepted .\n\n\nHowever , being too personal in interpretation may be susceptible to\ncriticism as a distortion of Bach  ' s intentions . \n\n\n \n\n\n  \" One is said to be a bad player if he doesn't\nconfined himself to what Bach wrote but alters it to suit his own\ninterpretive end . &rdquo;   \n\n\n Today , most organists have a pressing eagerness to find a way to\ncompromise between authenticity and personal insights .\n\n\nIt is probably the aims of all organists since the past century .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "b397c2c3-5444-4e8a-a267-51df1fc05c66", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.937372+00:00"}

same day stereotactic\nbiopsy plus gamma knife fro deep seated low grade astrocytomas , and the use\nof stereotactic MR angiography for arteriovenous malformations (  AVMs ) . \n\n \n\nDespite a relatively short follow-up time , the HKGKC has a\nhealthy academic output .\n\n\nIn addition to numerous invited presentations both locally and\noverseas , the radiosurgery team has managed to submit nine papers of which\nthree have already been accepted for publication in peer reviewed\ninternational journals .\n\n\nIn addition , the HKGKC also support a current PhD project on\nradiation physics . \n\n \n\nThe Leksell Gamma Knife Society Meeting is an international\nconference for academic exchange of research and clinical studies among 90\ngamma knife sites worldwide .\n\n\nIn November 1998 , the Hong Kong Gamma Knife Team won the\nchairmanship of the 9th Leksell Gamma Knife Meeting where more than 200\npapers were presented by delegates from 30 countries .\n\n\nPast chairmen included the giants of radiosurgery such as L . Steiner\n, C . Lindquist , S . Forster and D . Lundsford .   \n\n\n\nLINAC-BASED RADIOSURGERY SYSTEMS  \n\n \n\nNo description on radiosurgery is complete without mentioning\nlinac-based systems .\n\n\nTo date , at least five different systems are available in the market .\n\n\nAll of them employ different platforms of hardware and software ,\nstereotactic frames and techniques in delivery of focused energy .\n\n\nX-knife , Cyberknife , Linac Scalpel , etc are just a few familiar\nnames .\n\n\nHong Kong does not lag behind in the introduction of linac-based\nradiosurgery .\n\n\nThe first linac-based radiosurgery was set up in Queen Mary Hospital\nin November 1995 and within 4 years , there are totally seven linac-systems\n( five in public and two in private hospitals ) in Hong Kong .\n\n\nApart from more conventional arc-based systems , there are three that\nutilize mini-multileaf collimator (  mMLC ) .\n\n\nParticularly for nonspherical lesion , the latter is able to deliver\na lower dose of radiation to normal tissue and yet requires a much shorter\nplanning time .\n\n\nEvolving from the same idea , there is now the concept of delivering\nradiation via a motorized mulitleaf collimator (  MLC ) as it goes through an\narc .\n\n\nA prototype of this conformal arc system is soon to be tested in Hong\nKong .\n\n\nUndoubtedly the technology of linac-based radiosurgery is still being\nrefined and we are expecting more innovation from this branch of therapy .\n\n\n \n\nAt this point in time , however , without prospective randomized\ncontrolled trials , comparing gamma knife and linac-based systems is like\ncomparing apples and oranges .\n\n\nBoth systems have their own advantages and limitations .\n\n\nThe gamma knife , being a dedicated instrument for neuroradiosurgery\n, maintains the lead with its long track record , uniformly of methodology\nand large series of published results in the literature .\n\n\nThe authors believe the peaceful coexistence of different\ntechnologies is a healthy sign .\n\n\nClinical excellence comes form healthy competition , cross-speciality\nlearning , team work , concentrated experience , intellectual honesty and\nvigilant audit .   \n\n\nCOMPREHENSIVE RADIOSURGERY PROGRAMME  \n\n \n\nA venue where the two system come together is found in Queen\nElizabeth Hospital .\n\n\nSince 1996 , its radiosurgery programme has provided both linac-based\nand gamma knife radiosurgery in collaboration with the HKGKC . \n\n \n\nThe selection of the modalities of treatment is based on clinical\ngrounds and decisions are made by a team of radio-oncologists ,\nneuroradiologists and neurosurgeons .\n\n\nThe general principles of case selection are based on: 1. The\nproximity of the lesion to critical structures , 2. The treatment volume and\n3. The requirement for target precision , eg functional disorders . \n\n \n\nThere is a general inclination to treat malignant cases with\nlinac-based radiosurgery and pituitary tumours with gamma knife . \n\n \n\nWeekly combined radiosurgery clinics and monthly conferences\nensure exchanges of experience and problem cases .\n\n\nA clinical radiosurgery database completed with image files\nfacilitates research and follow-up case studies . \n\n \n\nTo date over 100 linac-based and 300 gamma knife radiosurgeries\nhave been performed (  Table 8.2 ) .   \n\n\nSUMMARY  \n\n \n\nThe gamma knife is undergoing constant evolution and refinement .\n\n\nAdvanced training , upgrading of hardware and software and continuous\neducation are part of the regular agenda .\n\n\nBe it an up-front or adjuvant procedure , its result on benign skill\nbase tumours and metastases and particularly impressive .\n\n\nAVMs form a special category where a multidisciplinary approach is\nthe norm , although the problem of postradiosurgery latency period bleeding\nhas not been eliminated .\n\n\nThe gamma knife also opens up frontiers in functional indications\nsuch as medically refractory trigeminal neuralgia , movement disorders ,\nnonlesional temporal lobe epilepsy and compulsive obsessive neurosis .\n\n\nRecently , patients with medically refractory malignant bone pain\nhave also responded dramatically to gamma pituitary ablation . \n\n \n\nWe have shown that the gamma knife does not erode into the\npractice of neurosurgeons .\n\n\nIt actually increases the surgical throughput of a neurosurgical\ndepartment and raises the competence of microsurgeons .\n\n\nToday  ' s patients are extremely demanding .\n\n\nThey expect zero mortality , near zero morbidity , near 100%\ndisease control and no disruption of life style .\n\n\nThey are very well informed and require a complete transparency of\ndata .\n\n\nHealth Management Organisations , lawyers , administrators and the\nlay public are happy to target the medical profession .\n\n\nAll these put tremendous pressure on neurosurgeons .\n\n\nNeurosurgeons must adapt to the new challenge .\n\n\nThey should give medical advice as if they are suffering from the\nsame ailment .\n\n\nTheir own perspective on the doctor-patient relationship may have to\nbe revised . \n\n\n  \n\n\nDesign and Implementation of a Variable Frequency Regulatory Water\nSupply System in Modern Buildings  \n\n \n\nDavid T.W. Chan \n\n \n\nDepartment of Electrical &ampersand; Communications Engineering , Hong Kong\nTechnical College (  Tsing Yi ) , 20 Tsing Yi Road , Tsing Yi , Hong Kong .\n\n\n \n\n\nABSTRACT \n\n\nThe designs of the variable frequency constant pressure water supply\nfor a single hydraulic pump and high power multiple hydraulic motor systems\nare presented in this paper .\n\n\nThis system can save energy by controlling the speed of the pipe\nmotors which depend upon the number of consumers in use .\n\n\nThis system was also successfully implemented in most of the modern\nbuildings in Shanghai , China .\n\n\nFinally , the choice criteria for variable frequency regulators for\nwater supply system will be discussed .   \n\n\n1 . INTRODUCTION  \n\n \n\nIt is inevitable to install high level water storage systems or\nreservoirs for multiple story buildings or residential areas .\n\n\nThis kind of system results in increasing construction cost and\ncleaning problems .\n\n\nNevertheless , hydraulic pumps are used to raise the energy level of\nthe water .\n\n\nIn fact , the conventional high level reservoir system is a pressure\nregulatory system .\n\n\nThis pressure (  head ) is proportional to the height of the reservoir .\n\n\nResistance of pipes is varying from time to time , depending on the\ndemand and water flow rate .\n\n\nWhen number of users increase , that means number of relief values\nto be open is increased .\n\n\nIt in turn reduces the resistance of the pipes .\n\n\nIn order to reduce the construction cost , eliminate the cleansing\nproblem of the high level reservoirs , and make the system simple , a\nvariable frequency constant pressure closed loop system is presented to\ncontrol the speeds of the hydraulic pumps .\n\n\nIn this paper , the designs of the variable frequency constant\npressure water supply for a single hydraulic pump and high power multiple\nhydraulic motors system are presented .\n\n\nFrom static characteristics of water flow system , the critical\npoint can be obtained to achieve the minimization of energy consumed .\n\n\nThe implementation of this system is also discussed .\n\n\nThe choice of variable frequency regulators for water supply system\nis finally presented .   \n\n\n2 . ADVANTAGES OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM  \n\n \n\nIn short , the advantages of this proposed variable frequency\nconstant pressure system for water supply are a ) In a 3 hydraulic motors\nsystem , the capacity of the variable frequency regulator is just one-third\nof the capacity of the overall system .\n\n\nThe cost is much reduced .\n\n\nb ) Since the system consists of multiple pumping motors , they can\nbe controlled by PLC such that the system is more reliable .\n\n\nc ) Energy saving can be achieved by controlling the speed of pump\nmotors , pressure can be kept constant no matter what water flow is (  from\nzero to its maximum capacity ) .\n\n\nd ) Each pumping motor can be started smoothly be using this variable\nfrequency regulator , it reduces pulse current .\n\n\nThis kind of water supply system could become a new trend in modern\nmultiple-story building design .   \n\n\n3 . PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION  \n\n \n\nThe principle of operation was illustrated by a single pump\nsystem .\n\n\nFig . 1 shows a block diagram of a variable frequency constant\npressure system which is suitable for single pump or small scale water flow\nsystem .\n\n\nThe model type is JS5-P1 .\n\n\nThe pressure sensor (  PS ) transduces the water pressure in pipes to\nelectrical signal .\n\n\nThis signal will go to pressure regulator (  PR ) through an amplifier\n( A ) and a comparator compared with the set value of water pressure .\n\n\nThe difference will come to the PID control to regulator the output\nfrequency as well as the speeds of electric motors and hydraulic pumps .\n\n\nThe constant pressure can then be achieved .  \n\n \n\nFig . 2 shows static characteristics of this constant pressure\nwater supply system .\n\n\nCurves 1 and 2 represent relationship between the pressure head (  H)\nand flowrate (  Q ) for different speeds of the pump .\n\n\nCurves 3 and 4 represent for different values of resistance pipe .\n\n\nTo simply the exposition , per unit values are adopted in the Fig .\n2 .\n\n\nHence H&star; &equals; H/H  N  and Q&star;&equals;Q/Q  N  where H  N\n and Q  N  are the set values of head and flowrate .  \n\n \n\nIn this system , both flowrate and the resistance of pipes are\nvarying because the flowrate is proportional to numbers of valves to be\nopened .\n\n\nCurve 3 represents the resistance of pipes when the flowrate reaches\nthe maximum point .\n\n\nIt intercepts with the H&star; - Q&star; at point a which is the set point for\noperation .\n\n\nCurve 4 is for resistance of pipe when the flowrate is less and only\npart of valves to be opened . \n\n \n\nIf there is no frequency regulator , it works at point b ' only .\n\n\nAt this moment , the head pressure exceeds the set value .\n\n\nThe flowrate Q is proportional to the speed of the pump , n .\n\n\nHead pressure H is thus proportional to the square of the speed , n\n 2  .\n\n\nThe speed of the pump can be controlled by the frequency regulator .\n\n\nIt becomes the curve 2 , which intercepts curve 4 at point b , it is\na new set (  working ) point .\n\n\nAt this time , the set speed should be n&star;&equals;n/n  N &equals;K (  K\n<1 ) .  \n\n\nObviously , the point b is lower than point b ' .\n\n\nIt in turn means that H at point b is less than that at point b'. H\n b  < H   b  .\n\n\nIt achieves the purpose of energy saving .   \n\n\n4 . FURTHER MODIFICATION  \n\n \n\nThis JS5-P1 model was suitable for single pump water supply\nsystem .\n\n\nWhen the flowrate is little , the pressure can be much reduced . For\nexample , H  p  &star; varies from 1 to H  p '  &star; which is less\nthan 1 (  H  p '  &star; <1 ) .  \n\n\nIt is able to save much energy .\n\n\nFrom this working principle , it was modified to suit a large scale\nmultiple pumping water supply system .\n\n\nA new model of JS5-P2 was then developed . \n\n \n\nFig . 3 shows a block diagram of a variable frequency constant\npressure system consisting of 3 same capacity pumps .\n\n\nIt was modified from the JS5-P1 model .\n\n\nIt is designed for multi-pumps water supple system which\nprogrammable logic control (  PLC ) is involved such that the number of\nhydraulic motors in operation can be determined by the flowrate .\n\n\nThe rest of motors are in stand-by mode and the energy saving can be\nrealized . \n\n \n\nFrom Fig . 3 , the system was composed of pressure sensor (  PS)\n, pressure amplifier (  A ) , pressure regulator (  AP ) , signal identifier ( \nAI ) , programmable logic control (  PLC ) , and frequency regulator .\n\n\nThe main feature of this system is that one set of variable\nfrequency regulator is in use to control one hydraulic motor .\n\n\nThe rest is idling at starting .\n\n\nIf the water flow is within the present range .\n\n\nThis motor is running according its characteristic curve .\n\n\nWhen the flowrate is increased , the second motor will be smoothly\nstarted .\n\n\nThe present value of pressure in pipes can be maintained .\n\n\nThere are three values for operating these motors , 0~33.3%\n, 33.3~66.6% and 66.6%~100% . \n\n \n\nIn brief , the first pump motor will work if the flowrate falls\nwithin 33.3% of operation .\n\n\nThe operating region is within curves 1 and 4 in the Fig . 4 .\n\n\nWhen the flowrate increases beyond 33.3% , frequency\nregulator keeps the output frequency at 50Hz , PLC will control of on-off\nstate of the motors such that the first pump motor is supplied by the mains .\n\n\nThe speed of the first pump motor runs at rated speed .\n\n\nThe region of the second motor is within curves 2 and 5 in the Fig .\n4 .\n\n\nWhen the flowrate is continuously increased and beyond 66.6%\n, and the frequency regulator reaches its rated frequency 50Hz , PLC will\ncommand the second motor to connect to the mains again and the third one at\nstand-by mode .\n\n\nThe operating region of the third one falls within curves 3 and 6 in\nthe Fig . 4 . \n\n \n\nIf the flowrate is reduced from 66.6% to 33.3% ,\nPLC will command to one of the pump motors cut off from the mains .\n\n\nWhen the flowrate further reduces , and less than 33.3% ,\nthere will be only one motor connected to the mains .\n\n\nFrom the working principle , the three motors are operated in turn\nto meet the requirement of energy saving .   \n\n\n5 . CRITERIA FOR FREQUECNY REGULATOR  \n\n \n\nFor the load of the hydraulic pump , the torque t  p \nis proportional to the square of the motor speed , n  2  , it is\nalso proportional to the square of the supply frequency , f  2  .\n\n\nTo a electric motor , the torque t  m  is equal to C  m\n ?  m  I  2  cosa , where C  m  is a constant\n, ?  m  is the magnetic flux of rotating field , I  2  is\nthe rotor current , and cosa is the power factor of rotor circuit .\n\n\nI  2  normally cannot exceed its rated value , so t  m\n ?  m  .\n\n\nIf the voltage drop in the stator is negligible , ?  m \nwill be proportional to supply voltage V.\n\n\nIn order to maintain t  p &equals;t  m  , the supply\nvoltage V should be required to be proportional to the square of the\nfrequency , f  2  .\n\n\nTherefore , the characteristic of V versus f should be set to be a\nquadratic relationship .  6 . CONCLUSION\n\n \n\nThis type of variable frequency constant pressure closed loop\nsystem for water supply was designed and implemented in Shanghai , China .\n\n\nThe performance was proven satisfactory .\n\n\nAll four advantages of this proposed system were fully realized .\n\n\nThis system is one of the energy saving methods in tall building\ndesign .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "af2b1ad4-5a49-47ec-bf6a-9cc6b243cef5", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.940367+00:00"}
{"text": "JULIA PO-WAH LAI TAO  \n\n\nTWO PERSPECTIVES OF CARE : CONFUCIAN   REN \n AND FEMINIST  CARE   \n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nConfucianism and feminism are two important alternative ethical\nsystems to the rule-based and principle-based approaches to ethics that have\ndominated the West in the past decades .\n\n\nUntil quite recently , these two ethics have seldom been brought\ntogether , partly because feminism is a new and fast-developing philosophy\nthat has always been regarded as inherently antipatriarchal .\n\n\nConfucianism , on the other hand , is an established traditional\nphilosophy that has been regarded as typically patriarchal .\n\n\nBut the two ethics share a common emphasis on the moral value of care\nand on the central importance of relationship as the basis of morality .\n\n\nFruitful comparisons and contrasts can promote critical\nself-reflection and self-development of the two ethical systems , and\ngenerate new insights and new challenges to enrich the search for a better\nunderstanding of the nature of morality . \n\n \n\nIn recent years , some comparisons between Confucianism and\nfeminism have begun to emerge .   \n\n\nBut these comparisons have tended to focus more on examining\nsimilarities and establishing common ground rather than on analyzing\ndifferences .\n\n\nFor example , in his article \" The Confucian Concept of \n Ren   and the Feminist Ethics of Care : A\nComparative Study &rdquo; published in  Hypatia  in 1994 , Chenyang\nLi identified three important philosophical common grounds that were claimed\nto be shared by feminist  care  ethics and Confucian ethics of \nren  .\n\n\nThese common grounds , according to Li are : ( 1 )\ncommon ethical ideals , ( 2 ) ethics without general principles\n, and ( 3 )   ren   and caring with\ngradations .\n\n\nIn his most recent book  The Tao Encounters The West  , Li\nbasically adhered to his original thesis of shared common grounds between the\ntwo ethics .\n\n\nI do not dispute that there are significant similarities between the\ntwo ethics .\n\n\nBut in my view , these are at best partial similarities between the\ntwo ethics .\n\n\nI do not dispute that there are significant similarities between the\ntwo ethics .\n\n\nBut in my view , these are at best partial similarities .\n\n\nI contend that there are in fact deep and important differences\nunderlying these partial similarities .\n\n\nI therefore propose to take a different route in this article to\nfocus on an examination of their fundamental differences to deepen our\nunderstanding of the two ethics .\n\n\nThe intention is not to show which provides a more correct or\nsuperior account of care .\n\n\nRather , an examination of differences between the two ethics of care\ncan be immensely useful for purposes of mutual self-critique , mutual\nself-enrichment , and mutual self-development .\n\n\nRecognizing their differences and similarities will offer important\ninsights to expand our understanding of the nature of morality and moral\nreasoning . \n\n \n\nI will start by highlighting some of the key observations that\nhave led to the claim that there are three shared common grounds between the\ntwo systems as identified by Li .\n\n\nI will then argue on the basis of countervailing textual evidences\nthat these are only partial similarities .\n\n\nI will also analyze some foundational differences between the two\nsystems and argue how these foundational differences underpin two distinct\nperspectives of care in Confucianism and feminism , based on different\nconceptions of the ideal of care , different attitudes toward the role of\nprinciples in moral reasoning and different understandings of the limits of\nmoral obligations .\n\n\nI will conclude by using two well-known Confucian case examples of\nmoral dilemmas to illuminate the insights that a Confucian perspective of\ncare can offer to expand understanding and development of care ethics on the\none hand , and to current wider debates on the nature of moral reasoning ,\nmoral judgement , and moral obligations on the other . \n\n \n\nIt should be noted that Confucianism is not a single unitary\ndiscourse .\n\n\nThis analysis is focused on the discourses of Confucius himself\n( 551-479 B.C. ) and Mencius ( 371-289 B.C. ? ) .\n\n\nLikewise , care ethics is not the only feminist ethics , nor is there\na uniform theory of feminist care ethics .\n\n\nThe discussion of feminist care ethics in this article is primarily\nfocused on the writings of Carol Gilligan and Nel Noddings , although there\nare occasional references to other feminist philosophers who have further\ndeveloped and expanded feminist care ethics . \n\n \n\nIt is also important to note that in the translations of the\nclassical texts quoted in this paper , the Chinese character for the common\nnoun \" \" people \" , &rdquo; which is nongendered , has\ncome to be translated as \" \" men \" &rdquo; in all the\ntranslations .\n\n\nLikewise , the Chinese character for the common noun  \n\" junzi \"   ( the morally cultivated\nperson ) has come to be translated as \" \" gentlemen\n\" . &rdquo;\n\n\nI also wish to point out that the words \" \" heart\n\" &rdquo; and \" \" mind \" &rdquo; are used\ninterchangeably by the Confucians -; the organ that feels and judges is\none and the same organ .  \n\n\nCOMMON GROUND BETWEEN CONFUCIAN ETHICS OF   REN\n  AND FEMINIST ETHICS OF CARE  \n\n\n Common Ethical Ideals  \n\n \n\nIt has been suggested that Confucian ethics share a common moral\npoint of departure in their acceptance of a noncontractual conception of\nsociety and in their acknowledgement of human relations rather than\nindividual rights as the basis of morality .   \n\n\nContrary to mainstream liberal thinking , they do not perceive\nsociety as arising out of an agreement made among rational and independent\ncontractors for mutual gains and peaceful existence .\n\n\nIn a contractual society , moral understanding is based on the\nconcept of individual rights .\n\n\nIn the Confucian and feminist conceptions , they both place a high\nmoral value on relatedness , obligation , and concern for others in their\nethics .\n\n\nThis leads to the claim that they also share a similar moral ideal\nthat is captured by the concept of care in the feminist perspective and by\nthe concept of   ren   in the Confucian\nperspective .\n\n\nThe common thread linking these two ideals of care and  \nren   is  caring  . \n\n \n\nIndeed , the Chinese character for   ren \n does in fact consist of a simple ideogram of a human figure and two\nhorizontal strokes suggesting human relations .\n\n\nIt has been translated by many terms including benevolence , love ,\naltruism , kindness , charity , compassion , perfect virtue , goodness , etc .\n\n\nIt is also true that the Confucian account locates the value of\ncaring and the responsibility to care in the virtue of   ren\n  .\n\n\nSimilar to the feminist perspective , in the Confucian account , care\nis understood as a form of altruistic regard .\n\n\nIt is both disposition and practice .\n\n\nIt involves being attentive to another  ' s well-being and being\nwilling to act to promote it .\n\n\nThe Confucian account shares with the feminist perspective the notion\nthat the concept of care implies action and assumption of responsibility .\n\n\nIt goes beyond an attitude of mere concern and respect and directs\nattention to action .\n\n\nHowever , although the concept of   ren  \nhas appeared as many as 105 times in the  Analects  , the collected\nsayings of Confucius , it was not once defined formally by Confucius himself .\n\n\nEach time Confucius or Mencius was asked to explain  \nren   , they gave a slight different answer , including the\nfollowing :  \n\n\nRen is to love people . ( Analects 12:22 )\n\n\nLove all men comprehensively . ( Analects 1:6 )\n\n\nA person of ren embraces all in his love . ( Mencius 7A:46\n)\n\n\nThe person of ren loves others . ( Mencius 4B:28 )\n\n\nLoving one  ' s parents is ren . ( Mencius 7A:15 ) \n\n \n\nAlthough the concept was never defined formally , it is clear on\nthe basis of these answers that the central notion of   ren\n  is &lsquo; love &rsquo; .\n\n\nIt is the key moral concept that guides human relations .\n\n\nThe concept has two senses .   \n\n\nAs a particular virtue ,   ren   refers\nto the virtues of benevolence and altruistic concern for others .\n\n\nAs a general virtue ,   ren   stands for\nperfect virtue , goodness or moral perfection .\n\n\n  Ren   in the general sense , provides\nthe overarching , unifying ethical framework in Confucian ethics .\n\n\nIt encompasses all the other particular virtues , such as benevolence\n, propriety , courage , filial piety , and loyalty .\n\n\nFor example , Confucius expressly said that without  \nren   , the virtue of following propriety ( \n li   ) is meaningless .  \n\n\n\nHe also said that \" A person of   ren \n will certainly also possess courage , but a brave person is not\nnecessarily   ren   . &rdquo;  \n \n\n \n\n  Ren   , as a prefect virtue ,\nunderlies all virtuous behaviors .\n\n\nIt is the virtue of virtues .\n\n\nIt enables us to make distinction between mere rashness and genuine\ncourage .\n\n\nIt imbues the other virtues with meaning .\n\n\nThe other virtues derive their ethical import either directly or\nindirectly from the cardinal virtue of   ren   .\n  \n\n\nThis does not mean , however , that these various particular virtues\nare actually collapsed into the cardinal virtue of   ren\n  .\n\n\nBut it does mean that these various particular virtues are\nappreciated only to the extent that they are related to and are guided by the\ngeneral virtue of   ren   . \n\n \n\nAs a general virtue ,   ren   is the\nhighest ethical ideal , the apex of moral achievement by the ideal moral\ncharacter .\n\n\nBy the same token , the ideal moral character in Confucian ethics is\n\" a person of   Ren   \" who is a\nmorally perfect person .\n\n\nThis also means that a person who has   ren \n as a general virtue must also have   ren  \nas a particular virtue .\n\n\nThis double character of   ren   as an\nethical ideal is a defining feature of Confucian ethics .  \n \n\n \n\nIn the Confucian account , the source of   ren\n  is located in the natural \" heart sensitive to the\nsufferings of others &rdquo; which all humans possess .\n\n\nMencius substantiated the claim in the following way :  \n\n\n No man is devoid of a heart sensitive to the suffering of\nothers .\n\n\nWhen I say that all men have a mind which cannot bear to see the\nsufferings of other , my meaning may be illustrated thus : suppose a man were\nall of a sudden to see a child about to fall into a well .\n\n\nHe will without exception experience a feeling of alarm and distress .\n\n\nHe will feel as so , not because he wants to gain the favor of the\nchild  ' s parents , nor to seek the praise of their neighbors and friends ,\nnor from a dislike of the cry of the child .\n\n\nThe heart of compassion is the seed of ren . 8  \n\n \n\nMencius explained human capacity for altruistic regard in terms\nof natural feelings of sympathy and compassion that arise in one  ' s heart\nwhen suffering is being witnessed .\n\n\nHe did not make any appeal to external transcendental sources or any\nsorts of consequentialist , utilitarian considerations .\n\n\nSuch a grounding makes Confucian ethics a secular ethics with a\nnonconsequentialist orientation .\n\n\nAs illustrated in Mencius  ' s example of the man near the well , the\ncompassion is a response to the imminent danger faced by the child and not\nbased on any motive to gain favor or praise or to fulfill some personal likes\nor dislikes in the man himself .\n\n\nThe Confucian ideal is to be able to extend this feeling to other\nthings in the world and thus make it a general disposition because the\nConfucians believe that \" for every man there are things he cannot bear .\n\n\nTo extend this to what he can bear is   ren \n . &rdquo;   \n\n\nA person of   ren   is therefore someone\nwho is able to take this natural feeling of sympathy and extend it from\n\" things he cannot bear &rdquo; to \" things he can bear . &rdquo;\n\n\nBecause the feelings of sympathy and compassion are natural feelings\nthat arise in one  ' s heart when suffering is being witnessed , Confucius said\n, \"   Ren   can only come from the self\n-; how could it come from others ? &rdquo;   \n\n\n \n\nIn the feminist perspective , the apex of morality is also caring .\n\n\nIt has been suggested that a similar structure can be found in\nNoddings  '  formulation of feminist care ethics in which she identifies caring\nas the highest ideal and locates the source of caring in two sentiments :\nnatural caring and ethical caring .   \n\n\nAccording to Noddings , the sentiment of natural caring is the\ninitial , enabling sentiment .\n\n\nThe second sentiment occurs in response to a remembrance of the first .\n\n\nIt arises out of this memory of our own best moments of caring and\nbeing cared for which sweeps over us as a feeling -; as an \" I must\n&rdquo; -; in response to the plight of the other . \n\n \n\nAccording to Noddings , I am closest to goodness when I accept\nand affirm the internal \" I must . &rdquo;\n\n\nThis goodness is felt and it guides thinking implicitly .\n\n\nWe remember having been cared for when we were young , and it is this\nwarm , pleasant memory that leads us to long for goodness and motivates us to\ncare for others .\n\n\nThe desire to act well is rooted in the desire to return to this\nstate .\n\n\nAs Noddings explains , \" It is this ethical ideal (\ncaring ) , this realistic picture of ourselves as one-caring , that\nguides us as we strive to meet the other morally . &rdquo;   \n\n\nThe ideal self as one-caring and cared for is closest to goodness ,\nwhich is the natural state of caring .\n\n\nThus when we commit ourselves to obey the \" I must, &rdquo; we\nare under the guidance of the ethical ideal , that vision of the best self .\n\n\n \n\nThe women interviewees in Carol Gilligan  ' s  In a Different\nVoice  all agreed that morality centers on care .  \n\n\n\nNoddings also argues that \" caring is important in itself\n&rdquo;    because in her view , \"  This\nvalue itself arises as a product of actual caring and being cared-for and my\nreflection on the goodness of these concrete caring situations  .\n&rdquo;   \n\n\nHer formulation of the ethics of caring locates morality primarily\nin the pre-act consciousness of the one-caring .   \n\n\nIt is disinterested concern and the subsequent\nwill/action/disposition to promote the welfare of the cared-for which are the\ndefining elements of the care ethics . \n\n \n\nThe analysis thus far seems to lend support to the claim that an\nimportant common ground shared by Confucian and feminist ethics is that the\npractice of caring is essential in both ethics for a person to become a moral\nperson .\n\n\nThey also seem to share a similar nonconsequentialist orientation ,\na similar emphasis on relationship as the basis of morality and on caring as\nthe highest ethical ideal .\n\n\nThere also seems to be good reasons for supporting the observation\nthat \" As the highest moral ideals ,   Ren \n and Care are good in themselves . &rdquo;\n\n\n\" They are not to be justified in terms of the consequences\nthey bring about , though the consequences are generally desirable . &rdquo;\n    \n\n\n Ethics without General Principles  \n\n \n\nBecause both Confucian ethics and feminist ethics emphasize\nparticular relationships and caring , this has led to the observation that\nthe two ethics have little room for general principles and no room for\nimpartial morality .\n\n\nThis is considered to be one of the distinctive characteristics of\nthe two ethics which marks them off from prevalent models in Western\nphilosophy , where it is widely accepted that general principles serve to\nguide moral conduct and decisions , and impartiality is the standard and\nfoundation of morality . \n\n \n\nIndeed , Noddings herself has expressly stated that \"\n The one-caring is wary of rules and principles .  &rdquo;\n  \n\n\nThis is because in her view ,   Ethical caring depends\nupon not rules or principles but upon the development of an ideal self -;\nthe ideal developed in congruence with one  ' s best remembrance of caring and\nbeing cared-for .  The ethical ideal is the guide to ethical conduct , not\nrule or principle .\n\n\nThe reasons are based upon ethical ideal rather than universal\nprinciple . 19  \n\n \n\nGilligan  ' s understanding of the care perspective is also\nnonprincipled and therefore nonuniversalizable .\n\n\nGilligan has expressly said that her aim is \" to turn the tide\nof moral discussion from questions of how to achieve objectivity and\ndetachment to how to engage responsively and with care . &rdquo;    \n\n \n\nIn her formulation of care ethics , Noddings also makes it very\nclear that it \" will not embody a set of universalizable moral\njudgements . &rdquo;\n\n\n\" Indeed, &rdquo; as Nodding confirms , \" moral\njudgement will not be its central concern . &rdquo;  \n\n\n\nThe central concern of morality , from the feminist care perspective\n, is to heighten moral perception and sensitivity instead .\n\n\nThe belief is that the morality of a decision does not lie in its\npossible generalizability or applicability to other situations .\n\n\nThe primary criteria to guide moral reasoning and decision making\nshould be care and sympathy .\n\n\nEthical behaviour is guided by the ethical ideal of caring and not\nby principles or rules .\n\n\nThe central question to ask is not about moral judgement but about\nmoral attitude . \n\n \n\nIn comparing Confucianism with feminist care ethics , Li made\nthe point that likewise , \"  rules are not an essential feature\nof Confucian morality .  &rdquo;   \n\n\nFor example , as mentioned earlier , although Confucius talked many\ntimes about how to become a person of   ren   ,\nhe never gave a general guideline .\n\n\nEach time , the answer was something different .\n\n\nConfucius seems to imply that   ren  \ncannot be achieved by following general principles . \n\n \n\nMencius himself also made the observation that three ancient\nsages in Chinese history -;   Po Yi   , \n Yi Yin   , and   Liu Xiahui \n -; \" all followed different paths , but their goal was one .\n\n\nWhat is meant by &lsquo; \" one \" &rsquo; ?\n\n\nThe answer is &lsquo;   ren   . &rsquo;\n\n\nAll that is to be expected of a gentleman is &lsquo;  \nren   . &rsquo; &rdquo;   \n\n\nIt is very clear that Mencius is arguing that there can be only one\nabsolute standard of measure for humankind and this is the standard of \n ren   .\n\n\nBut there can be many ways to attain this standard and they could\nvary with different individuals . \n\n \n\nMencius further said , \"  A gentleman needs not\nkeep his word nor does he necessarily see his action through to the end . \n\n\nHe aims only at what is right ( appropriate ) .\n&rdquo;     \n\n\nMencius  ' s claim here clearly is that general principles do not\nalways determine what is appropriate and that a person of   ren\n  is one with good judgement who knows what to do and when .\n\n\nThis echoed the earlier point from Confucius that \" \n Ren   can only come from the self -; how could\nit come from others ? &rdquo;    \n\n \n\nThese observations seem to support the view that indeed both the\nConfucian and the feminist care ethics can be characterized as ethics without\ngeneral principles .\n\n\nIn both ethics , there seems to be an absence of universal rules or\ngeneral principles , an insistence that rules are not absolute and overriding\n, and an emphasis on moral sensitivity over principles and moral reasoning .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "7327506d-d61f-4700-86ab-b1f7dcf926e4", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.942100+00:00"}
{"text": "Home truths  \n\n \n\nEven though mortgage rates have fallen to three per cent , the\nlowest in as many years , and flat prices have more than halved since the\npeak of 1997 , tens of thousands of vacant flats are still looking for buyers .\n\n\n \n\nNo wonder the Government is said to be considering slashing the\npublic sector  ' s housing production target by one-third , from 45,700 flats a\nyear to about 32,000 .\n\n\nIn fact , the original target has long been in effect ditched , and\nthe current move is aimed at reconciling policy with reality . \n\n \n\nBut a deeper question that policy-makers need to ask is about the\nfuture of public housing . \n\n \n\nHong Kong  ' s public housing programme was conceived at a time when\nthe territory was much poorer .\n\n\nThe provision of cheap rental flats for hundreds of thousands of\nlow-income families has been a pillar of stability in a place where\ndisparities of wealth abound . \n\n \n\nIn time , flats have also been built for sale at subsidised rates\nto families who want to own their homes but are not well off enough to buy in\nthe private market . \n\n \n\nDuring the process , a monolithic Housing Authority and Housing\nDepartment that employ more than 10,000 civil servants has also been\nestablished . \n\n \n\nBut the argument for subsidised home sales has always been weak .\n\n\nMarket forces have been able to drive down the costs of housing to\naffordable levels in most places .\n\n\nThere is no reason why Hong Kong cannot do the same , unless we\naccept that the biggest stumbling block here is that the Government is the\nbiggest landlord as it owns all the land . \n\n \n\nA case could also be made for giving eligible households rental\nvouchers instead of maintaining a big bureaucracy to build flats for them .\n\n\n \n\nClearly , the currently depressed state of the private housing\nmarket has provided an opportunity for the Government to rethink its housing\nstrategy . \n\n \n\nThe move towards providing housing loans and rental subsidies\ninstead of building yet more flats for eligible households is a step in the\nright direction , as is the decision to require the Housing Authority to turn\nover sites vacated by the demolition of old public housing estates . \n\n \n\nContrary to its avowed free-market economic philosophy , the\nGovernment  ' s participation in the housing market has been great .\n\n\nIt is time it reduced its involvement and gave the private sector\nmore room to meet the population  ' s housing aspirations . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Defining the problem  \n\n \n\nTo say that all Muslim nations think alike is to be ignorant of\nthe religion and its regional diversities .\n\n\nFor this reason , it is wrong of Israel to suppose that Yasser Arafat\ncan control the political views of his people simply because they share the\nsame prayer book . \n\n \n\nNowhere has the diversity been more apparent than at this week  ' s\nsummit of the Organisation of Islamic Conference in Kuala Lumpur .\n\n\nThe inability of the 50 participating nations to reach consensus on\ncurbing terrorism - because they cannot agree on the definition of a\nterrorist - highlights the problem . \n\n \n\nIsrael says Mr Arafat is as much a terrorist as the Palestinian\nsuicide bombers who are killing Israeli civilians .\n\n\nThey say the Palestinian leader can prevent extremists and his\ninability to do so is justification to hold him as a prisoner . \n\n \n\nMuslim nations are united in their condemnation of Israel , yet\nthey cannot agree on whether the bombers are terrorists .\n\n\nArab nations , especially Iran , Iraq and Syria , say attacks against\nIsrael are a just response to Israeli aggression .\n\n\nMore moderate nations , such as Malaysia , think otherwise . \n\n \n\nThis disharmony of opinion has derailed Malaysian Prime Minister\nMahathir Mohamad  ' s attempts at the summit to find common Muslim ground in\ndealing with the question of how to tackle terrorism . \n\n \n\nHis desire is admirable and his call on Monday for a resolution\nwas enlightening .\n\n\nNations worldwide are using the events of September 11 in the US to\njustify harsh action against political opponents and long-running\ninsurgencies . \n\n \n\nDr Mahathir also has problems with growing Muslim fundamentalism\nin Malaysia , but it is wrong to call religious opposition terrorism .\n\n\nAlthough his recognition of the lack of a definition of terrorism is\nto be applauded , complex issues - such as that involving the Israelis and\nPalestinians - cannot be dealt with by committees using a set of rules . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Reality check  \n\n \n\nDedicated viewers of Hong Kong  ' s bid to join the technology\nrevolution can watch the action unfold live on Cyberport  ' s official Web site .\n\n\nUnfortunately , those expecting inspiring scenes of skateboarding\ntechnologists networking over cappuccinos will be disappointed . \n\n \n\nConceived as a government-run effort to hoist the SAR up the\ntechnology ladder , officials have confirmed what had become an open secret\nin recent months .\n\n\nLittle demand exists for a glitzy , yet remote , campus development ,\ndespite knock-down rents and huge pressure on big-name firms to move . \n\n \n\nHong Kong  ' s effort to copy Silicon Valley  ' s success had a\ncontroversial birth when the project was not opened for competitive tender .\n\n\nCritics charged that tried-and-tested laissez-faire principles had\nbeen compromised .\n\n\nMost pointedly they argued that Hong Kong had no need for such a\nproject as firms would be loath to relocate staff to a suburban backwater .\n\n\n \n\nIt is far too early to dub Cyberport a white elephant , but\nyesterday  ' s confirmation that only three tenants have signed up to its first\nphase is pitiful .\n\n\nOfficial claims that all is well with the letting process look\nincreasingly foolish . \n\n \n\nLess than two years ago the Government and Pacific Century\nCyberWorks joint venture claimed expressions of interest from 155 firms that\nincluded many blue chip technology giants .\n\n\nYet when push came to shove , fears of being isolated from the\ncommercial hub and employees ' reluctance to endure the commute seem the main\nsticking points . \n\n \n\nOfficials can justly point to the collapse in the technology\nsector  ' s prospects and the project  ' s building site status .\n\n\nHowever , firms ' cautious promises to consider a move during the\nproject  ' s later phase suggest a face-saving get-out . \n\n \n\nPart of the problem is the grinding fall in rents caused by\nrising office supply and a poor economy .\n\n\nIf firms can renegotiate existing leases at attractive rates they\nhave little incentive to move and incur expensive fit-out costs .\n\n\nCyberport  ' s high management fees do not help .\n\n\nThe promise of free broadband Internet access is hardly a major draw\nas intense competition among service providers forces bandwidth prices ever\nlower . \n\n \n\nAn increasing amount of academic research suggests government\nefforts to foster technology clustering has limited success .\n\n\nIndeed , the partially complete Hong Kong Science Park in Tai Po is\nalso struggling to find tenants for its applied research and testing centre\ndespite rock-bottom rents . \n\n \n\nThe Government faces hard choices .\n\n\nWith the hotly contested Route 7 road link not slated for completion\nuntil 2010 at the earliest , poor access will dog Cyberport for years to come .\n\n\n \n\nWith the market so far seemingly rejecting the venture it may be\ntime to consider the unthinkable .\n\n\nMany government agencies and university departments are crying out\nfor improved facilities .\n\n\nRather than lease spanking new office space at \" any price &rdquo; ,\nalternative uses should perhaps be considered .\n\n\nThe whole exercise could then be put down to experience . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Moment of truth  \n\n \n\nThe Middle East is imploding and the world community is sitting\non its hands .\n\n\nUnder the media glare that is constantly on the Israelis and\nPalestinians , the words of protest may seem loud , but without further\naction they are meaningless . \n\n \n\nHundreds of lives have been lost in 18 months of tit-for-tat\nterror .\n\n\nThe human toll soars , yet diplomatic efforts lack urgency .\n\n\nEnvoys have come and gone while the people who could make a\ndifference - United States President George W . Bush , United Nations\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan and British Prime Minister Tony Blair - have\nstayed away . \n\n \n\nThe maxim that talk is cheap was never truer . Resolutions at the\nUN have always meant little when combatants are locked in battle .\n\n\nArab calls for a peacekeeping force have been ignored and Israel ,\ndeaf-eared , has pushed on unimpeded . \n\n \n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon  ' s hounding of Palestinian\nleader Yasser Arafat was bound to inflame Palestinian passions .\n\n\nMilitarily impotent , their response - suicide attacks on Israeli\ntargets - drew an obvious response .\n\n\nBut Mr Sharon  ' s imprisoning of Mr Arafat , an elected leader , in\nhis compound , and its destruction of the Palestinian infrastructure has\ntaken the conflict to a step beyond reason . \n\n \n\nHezbollah guerillas in Lebanon have now entered the fray ,\nresuming attacks on Israeli targets .\n\n\nIsrael has a military challenge on this new front and Lebanon has\nwarned that the Arab world could get sucked into the fighting . \n\n \n\nLessons were painfully learned following similar international\ninaction towards Rwanda and the Balkans .\n\n\nThe images of the pain and suffering in the Middle East are just as\nhorrendous , yet there is no rush to correct the mistakes of the past . \n\n \n\nMr Bush  ' s war on global terrorism is inextricably tied up in the\nArab-Israeli conflict .\n\n\nIt was one of the reasons for the September 11 attacks in New York\nand Washington and it is why the word \" terrorist ' has become so\nmisused by both sides . \n\n \n\nArabs and Jews have been at war for centuries .\n\n\nTheir problems will not be solved by warnings , threats or\ncondemnations .\n\n\nOnly with tough international mediation and the use of peacekeepers\ncan the powder keg be prevented from exploding . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Elderly deserve better  \n\n \n\nThe unhappy conditions in which many of Hong Kong  ' s elderly live\nis cause for concern , and reflects poorly on a society that has\ntraditionally taken great care of the aged . \n\n \n\nA study commissioned by the Government on the state of our senior\ncitizens makes depressing reading .\n\n\nThirty per cent of the suicides in Hong Kong involve the aged , even\nthough they make up only 14 per cent of the population .\n\n\nOn an average , one case of elderly suicide is reported every 1.5\ndays . \n\n \n\nPerhaps predictably , poor health and depression are revealed to\nbe major causes for suicide .\n\n\nMore alarmingly , physical abuse is also found to be a cause for\nsuicide among the aged .\n\n\nThe 143 cases of abuse reported in 1999 to the Social Welfare\nDepartment is in all likelihood a small percentage of the actual number of\ncases , given the natural reluctance of people to complain formally about\nbeing abused .\n\n\nThis is especially so when family members and carers are those\nresponsible for the problem . \n\n \n\nThe elderly and the very young are the two most vulnerable social\ngroups .\n\n\nCaring for your children is something that comes a lot more naturally\nthan caring for elderly parents , especially when money and resources are\nscarce .\n\n\nAs our news report points out , elderly people who are financially\ndependent on their children are often regarded as a burden .\n\n\nThere are cases of aged people who spend their time wandering the\nstreets because of strained relationships with their children .\n\n\nThis alienation is one cause of suicide . \n\n \n\nThe Government would do well to examine the pros and cons of\nintroducing legislation to protect the aged from abuse .\n\n\nWhile it is true that the mere existence of a law will not prevent\nabuse , it will act as a deterrent .\n\n\nIt will also demonstrate that Hong Kong is a society that is willing\nto protect its elderly . \n\n \n\nIn addition , the Government should consider targeting a larger\nproportion of its welfare spending on care for the elderly .\n\n\nElderly men and women should not be forced to work in demeaning\noccupations in order to earn enough to stay alive . \n\n \n\nThere is a clear case for additional resources to be spent on\nhousing , feeding and caring for Hong Kong  ' s elderly , so that they are not\nforced by poverty , ill health and neglect into taking their lives . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Lost in the past  \n\n \n\nWarnings of Afghanistan  ' s slide back into anarchy have always\nbeen pushed aside by optimists .\n\n\nAs the interim administration staggers towards the end of its\nsix-month term , it is obvious the pessimists were right and that the country  ' s\ninternational saviours have been blinded into inactivity by the euphoria of\ntheir good deeds . \n\n \n\nThe similarities to what happened in the aftermath of the\nSoviet invasion in the 1980s are striking .\n\n\nThe Soviets also believed they could quickly put their stamp on\nAfghanistan , but soon found it impossible to rein in the dissident elements\nin far-flung provinces beyond the capital , Kabul . \n\n \n\nAfter the defeated Soviets pulled out in 1989 and a glimmer of\nhope shone for a united government , the provincial warlords scuppered United\nNations-initiated moves . \n\n \n\nThis same scenario now stares the United States , Britain and\nother members of the alliance against global terrorism in the face .\n\n\nTheir good intentions and well-meaning actions have cost billions\nof dollars , but done little to restore the promised law , order and security .\n\n\n \n\nMost alarming in recent days has been the uncovering of an\nalleged plot to overthrow interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai .\n\n\nHundreds of people have been arrested for planning bomb attacks in\nKabul and ethnic Pashtun warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar is said to be behind\nthem .\n\n\nRight-wing Islamic groups have been accused of financing robberies\nand murders . \n\n \n\nAmerican and British officials have in recent weeks recognised\nthat their work has only just begun .\n\n\nBillions of dollars in financial pledges was a start , but\nAfghanistan also needs stability and security , and it is up to the

says Khuong , whose main job is to coach guests in sports\nactivities on the resort , ranging from tennis and scuba-diving , to\nwater-skiing and kite-flying . \n\n \n\nIt  ' s not difficult to see why Caine and his fellow cast members\nenjoyed he place so much .\n\n\nLocated on the renowned China Beach , a 30-kilometre stretch of\ngolden sand , the four-year-old resort tastefully combines Vietnamese\narchitecture , French interiors and high-tech comforts . \n\n \n\nAnd it is no coincidence the Furama chose Danang as the location\nfor its &dollar;300 million investment .\n\n\nVietnam  ' s third-largest city , halfway between Ho Chi Mihn City and\nHanoi , has all the essential elements to turn itself into a major gateway\ndestination: its year-round warm climate , endless pristine beaches , lush\ngreen mountains , close-by historical relics , French colonial buildings and\nfriendly people . \n\n \n\nThe area was once the kingdom of Champa , which existed between\nthe 12th and 17th centuries .\n\n\nThe Chams , who adopted Hinduism , are best known for the many brick\nsanctuaries they constructed throughout central Vietnam .\n\n\nA fine collection of their art can be found at the Cham Museum in\nDanang . \n\n \n\nA three-hour bus ride from Danang , followed by a bumpy journey\nthrough the hills in left-behind American Jeeps , lies My Son , the spiritual\ncenter of the ancient Cham civilsation .\n\n\nMy son is like a miniature version of Angkor Wat in Cambdia .\n\n\nThe valley became a religious focal point in the late fourth century\nand remained in use for almost 1,000 years .  \n\n \n\nJust as fascinating , and far easier to reach , is the historical\ncity of Hoi An , only 30 minutes down the coast road from Danang .\n\n\nAt its monthly lantern festival , on full-moon night , lights in the\nold quarter are turned off and the streets are lit with colourful paper\nlanterns . \n\n \n\nThe idea came from Hoi An  ' s controversial mayor , Nguyen Su ,\nwho believes that the city  ' s economic future lies in preserving and\npromoting its historical relics and rich culture .\n\n\nTo prevent the city from losing its authentic flavour , the\ngovernment even regulates the height of buildings and the kinds of wood and\npaint that can be used .  \n\n \n\n Ho Xuan Khuong , above , keeps things lively at Danang  ' s\ngorgeous Furama Resort on China Beach , where lifeguards , right , to see the\nwelfare of visitors some three decades after American Gls called the beach\ntheir favourite off-duty R&R locale  \n\n \n\nA short drive away , for various fit enough to climb a few\nhundred stone steps , lies Marble Mountain , traditionally known as Mountains\nof the Five Elements .\n\n\nDuring the height of the Vietnam War , Viet Cong guerillas cheekily\nused one of the caves as a temporary hospital , even though it was within\nstrolling distance of the American military base at Danang .\n\n\nThe cave is now a Buddhist shrine . \n\n \n\nCompared to the other resort destinations in Asia , Danang is\ncertainly a newcomer .\n\n\nStill underdeveloped , its roads are bumpy , street lighting is\nsporadic and the local people  ' s English is limited .\n\n\nBut its mild tropical climate , rural flavour and lack of any\nsignificant development give it an advantage over crowded destinations such\nas Phuket in Thailand . \n\n \n\nA new three-day , two-night package , offered jointly by Furama\nResort and Pacific Airlines , makes Danang an expecially convenient weekend\ngateway for Hong Kong people: the package price of around &dollar;4,000 is\nsimilar to those offered to Phuket , but the journey is far easier .\n\n\nJust over an hour after leaving Hong Kong , the plane touches down in\nDanang .\n\n\nA quick 10-minute drive and visitors are at the Furama Resort , where\nthey can enjoy its swimming pools , lagoons , a variety of water sports on\nthe beach and spa treatments - at a third of what it would cost in Hong Kong .\n\n\n \n\nThis stretch of coastline is unlikely to remain undiscovered for\nlong .\n\n\nThe local government has been investing heavily in developing tourism\nwith the aim of turing the region into \" another Phuket &rdquo; in 10\nyears .\n\n\nTwo more international resort will be completed in the next few years\nand Furama is planning to build an 18-hole golf course and club house with\nguest rooms at Marble Mountains . \n\n \n\nA key figure in this effort is Paul Stoll , the general manager\nof the Furama Resort , who also advises the local government on destination\ndevelopment .\n\n\nRecently he became the first foreigner to be presented with a\npersonal certificates of merit from the Vietnamese government in recognition\nof his tireless efforts .\n\n\nIn fact , the German native , who worked at Hong Kong  ' s Furama Hotel\nin the early 1990s , is so committed to Danang that he has decided to make it\nhis home for life . \n\n \n\n\" Since I first came here in 1994 , everything has changed\n, &rdquo; Stoll says .\n\n\n\" The old-fashioned Russian turbojets have been replaced by\nAirbus aircraft .\n\n\nThe original domestic airport is now international .\n\n\nThere was no concept of promotion at the time , whereas now the\ngovernment is actively promoting Danang as a destination . \n\n \n\n\" I  ' m committed to Danang because this is where you can\ncreate something and make things happen .\n\n\nYou can influence the government and make contributions .\n\n\nAnd this is a good feeling . &rdquo;

Get the best that money can buy .  \n\n\n By Stella Suen  \n\n \n\n N  ow for something you can  really  sink\nyour teeth into: beef .\n\n\nAnd we  ' re not talking about your run-of-the-mill , bland , tough as\nnails , hide-like slab which can only be cut with tools branded \" Black\n& Decker . &rdquo;\n\n\nRather , we  ' re talking about some of the finest , most exclusive\nsteaks in the world that are well worth breaking tour piggy bank for . \n\n\n\n In Its Prime  \n\n \n\nWhoever said you get what you pay for must have been referring to\nbeef .\n\n\nThe best of the best in the US is so fantastic in taste and texture\nthat it  ' s worth every precious penny .\n\n\nAnd be warned: It  will  cost more than a few . \n\n \n\nThe top grade of beef in the US is United States Department of\nAgriculture (  USDA ) Prime .\n\n\nThis title is reserved for only the finest two percent of all\nAmerican beef . Below this grade are seven others , including Choice , Select\n, Standard and more . \n\n \n\nBut , you ask , is it  really  that good ?\n\n\nFrankly , it is .\n\n\nOne bite is all you  ' ll need to be convinced , although it might\nmake you turn your nose up at future , less fabulous offers .\n\n\nOne key characteristic of Prime beef is an incredible , melt-in-your\nmouth tenderness that  ' s not found in other grades of beef .\n\n\nThe tenderness and texture comes from the abundance of evenly\ndistributed marbling in the meat (  i.e . the presence of fat , which tastes\ngood and keeps thing moist ) due to the cow  ' s strict diet of grain or corn .\n\n\n \n\nIt  ' s steaks from grain-fed Midwestern cows that you  ' ll find at\n Morton  ' s of Chicago . \n\n\nWhile you can pal around with the general manager , Steve McCrimmon ,\nor the friendly bartenders , there  ' s no kidding when it comes to the meat .\n\n\nSteaks are a serious business here .\n\n\nAnd if you haven't already seen or heard , they  ' re oversized , too .\n\n\n\" Our biggest seller is the 24 oz porterhouse , because you  ' ve\ngot two different kinds of meat there; the New York strip and the fillet ,\n&rdquo; says McCrimmon .\n\n\nBut if that  ' s too small for your taste , they also have one that  ' s\na walloping 48 oz and takes about half an hour to cook .\n\n\nBut before you tuck in , know that your steak has been aged .\n\n\n\" Aging is very important because the process tenderises the meat and\ncreates a more mature flavor .\n\n\nWe do it tow-and-a-half to three weeks , and we et-age it .\n\n\nBecause it  ' s wrapped in Cryovac (  a high-grade plastic bag ) and\nvacuum-sealed , it comes out moist and tender .\n\n\nThe flavor is not intense; it  ' s very light and tastes very good in\nthe mouth , &rdquo; he explains . \n\n \n\n Ruth  ' s Chris Steak House  also serves up a mean\nUSDA Prime steak .\n\n\nTwo of their most popular cuts are the filet (  eight or 12 oz ) and\nthe ribeye (  12 or 16 oz ) .\n\n\nTheir beef is aged up to 28 days .\n\n\nA meal here is all about the sizzle: Their 1800\u00ba F broiler cooks your\nsteak , which is then served on a 500\u00ba F super-heated plate .\n\n\nSo you  ' ll actually be able to hear your steak coming , and the plate\nensures it stays hot and juicy through the last bite . \n\n \n\nIf you prefer steaks on a smaller scale ,  Mr . Steak\n is the place for you .\n\n\nTheir US Prime steaks are right or 10 oz and range from a ribeye to a\nfilet mignon . And , because of their location at The Sanlitun , you can dine\nalfresco and people-watch to your heart  ' s content .\n\n\nThere are a couple of US Prime options at the  San Francisco\nSteak House ,  too , including a 10 oz sirloin and a 14 oz ribeye .\n  \n\n\n A Yen for Beef  \n\n \n\nThe other legendary beef in the world of meat is Kobe .\n\n\nAnd more recently , Wagyu beef has been showing up on menus around\ntown .\n\n\nKobe beef is an exclusive grade of beef that comes from the Wagyu cow .\n\n\nIn order to earn the official crown of \" Kobe Beef , &rdquo; the\nWagyu beef must come from Kobe , Japan , and meet with the rigid production\nstandards imposed in that prefecture .\n\n\nThe rating system is pretty complicated and includes the evaluation\nof color , fat color , marbling scores from one to 12 , and meat texture .\n\n\nThe beef is famous for its flavor and tenderness , and again , both\nare due to fat . Wagyu cattle actually have a genetic predisposition to\nmarbling over other breeds , so for the diner , this means a long-lasting\ntaste experience and full , meaty flavor held in the fat of the steak .\n\n\nSome say Kobe beef rivals even foie gras for richness and caloric\ncontent .  \n\n \n\n Char-grilled steak with all the trimmings at The Steak\nHouse .  \n\n \n\n The signature porterhouse at Morton  ' s of Chicago .\n \n\n \n\n The interior of Lan's .  \n\n \n\nIn Japan , Wagyu cows get the royal treatment .\n\n\nMassaged with sake and fed beer along with their grains , the cows\nproduce meat that  ' s extremely and consistently tender , finely marbled , and\ndelicious .\n\n\nBut land is precious and costly in Japan , so there  ' s a growing\ntrend of raising Wagyu cows in other countries , like the US and Australia ,\nand giving them the same imperial pampering . \n\n \n\n The Steak House  serves aged USDA Prime as well as\nWagyu beef from Australia , and the steaks are done the traditional way -\nover a charcoal grill .\n\n\nFor the USDA you can choose something a little smaller , like the\npetite filet mignon (  8 oz ) , or really go for the gusto and order the\nTexas-cut porterhouse (  24 oz ) .\n\n\nIf you  ' d rather have the Wagyu , there are three choices on the\nmenu: two striploins of different grades (  grade 8 and 10 , both 12 oz ) and a\ntenderloin (  grade 8 , 8oz ) \n\n \n\nTo educate your palate , consider comparing and contrasting\nsteaks .\n\n\nIf you  ' d rather not share with your dinner companions ,  Lan  ' s\n very wisely offers combinations .\n\n\nLan  ' s Treasure Sampler includes an 8 oz dry-aged ribeye steak , a 3\noz US Kobe New York strip steak , and a 4 oz US lamb rib chop .\n\n\nThe menu also offers a char-grilled 5 oz US Kobe filet - which is\ndaintily called the \" ladies cut &rdquo; and is for smaller appetites -\nas well as an enormous 35 oz US Prime slow-roasted , dry-aged rib of beef\nthat  ' s meant for two (  but we know people who can polish it off all on their\nlonesome ) .\n\n\nSo go ahead and dig into you bank account .\n\n\nThe tasty , tender experience is well worth it .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "be9f6eb4-1b56-4907-ad08-c0a6ab5b359b", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.945019+00:00"}

just leave the peel at room\ntemperature until fully dried , then store in an airtight jar .\n\n\nThis is good for flavouring congees and stews . \n\n \n\nCandied segments of tangerine make an easy petit four to serve\nwith coffee .\n\n\nPeel the fruit , separate the segments and remove all the loose\nthreads .\n\n\nLay the fruit on a rack to dry for about 15 minutes .\n\n\nLine baking sheets smoothly with aluminium foil and spray very\nlightly with pan coating .\n\n\nLightly spray the tips of a pair of chopsticks with pan coating and\nhave these and the pans ready by the side of the stove . \n\n \n\nPour granulated sugar in a small , heavy saucepan and moisten the\nsugar with a little water and a tea-spoon of strained fresh lemon juice .\n\n\nHeat over a low flame , stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon\nuntil the sugar is dissolved .\n\n\nUsing a wet pastry brush , remove all sugar crystals on the sides of\nthe pan - this prevents the caramel from crystallising .\n\n\nCook without stirring over medium heat until the caramel turns amber\n, then remove from the heat .\n\n\nThe caramel will continue to darken . \n\n \n\nWorking quickly and carefully , dip the tangerine segments into\nthe caramel , remove and lay them on the baking sheet with the chopsticks ( \nthe oil will prevent the caramel sticking , but you  ' ll have to spray the\ntips occasionally as you work ) .\n\n\nAllow the segments to cool until the caramel hardens , then ideally\nserve within two hours .\n\n\nDo not refrigerate .  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Sugar and spice   \n\n\nBEST BUY  Susan Jung   susanjung@scmp.com  \n\n \n\nCinnamon is one of favourite spices and I use it frequently in\ndesserts and pastries .\n\n\nAs stick or bark , cinnamon is used to flavour sauces or poaching\nliquids .\n\n\nThe powdered form is used mostly in baked products .\n\n\nIt is also good in savoury dishes - it  ' s one of the spices in\nChinese five-spice powder and it  ' s also used in Indian and Middle Eastern\ndishes . \n\n \n\nIn desserts , cinnamon goes very well with apples and pears .\n\n\nFor a simple dissert , roll out a sheet of puff pastry (  all-buttery\npastry is the best ) until it  ' s very thin .\n\n\nChill for at least 30 minutes in the fridge , then cut in a large\ncircle using a sharp knife .\n\n\nPick the dough all over with a fork (  this helps it rise evenly ) then\nlayer with this slices peeled apples , starting from the outside and working\ntowards the centre .\n\n\nSprinkle with cinnamon sugar (  mix one cup of granulated sugar with\none tablespoon of ground cinnamon ) then bake in a pre-heated oven (  170\ndegrees Celsius ) until brown .\n\n\nServe with chilled cream whipped with sugar , ground cinnamon and\nbrandy or cognac .\n\n\nCinnamon toast is a simple and easy breakfast - toast the bread ,\nthen butter it well .\n\n\nSprinkle it liberally with cinnamon sugar then put under the grill\nuntil it bubbles .\n\n\nLet it cool slightly before eating .\n\n\nUse cinnamon sugar the next time you make sweet yeast bread .\n\n\nRoll the dough into a rectangle , brush with melted room temperature\nbutter , sprinkle with cinnamon sugar then roll up into a log , pinching the\ndough tightly to seal the seam .\n\n\nCut into rounds , then bake in muffin pans .\n\n\nAfter the rolls are baked , brush with melted butter while still hot\n, then dredge in cinnamon sugar . \n\n \n\nCinnamon goes beautifully with chocolate - cinnamon milk\nchocolate truffles are wonderful .\n\n\nThe next time you make chocolate chip cookie dough , try adding a\nlittle ground cinnamon . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Best Buys - Turnover to raisins   \n\n\nBy  Susan Jung  (  Email: susan.jung@scmp.com ) \n\n \n\nI used to dislike raisins because they reminded me of primary\nschool snacks - served in a little red box with a glass of apple juice .\n\n\nThen I discovered rum raisin ice cream and rum raisin chocolate and\nrealised that rum (  or brandy ) makes raisins taste better . \n\n \n\nWhen I worked in pastry kitchens , we rarely used plain raisins:\nwe would put them in airtight containers , poured in bottles of rum or brandy\nand let the raisins soak for at least a week .\n\n\nIf you  ' re putting these alcohol-soaked raisins in cookies , dust\nthem lightly with flour first so they  ' ll mix into the dough better . \n\n \n\nFor rum raisin truffles , roughly chop about 100 grams of drained\n, rum-soaked raisins .\n\n\nHeat 200ml heavy whipping cream and when it simmers , pour over 200\ngrams chopped bittersweet chocolate .\n\n\nStir until smooth , then stir in the chopped raisins and a few\nspoonfuls of the rum used to soak the raisins .\n\n\nPour into a shallow dish and leave in a cool place until firm .\n\n\nYou can put it in the fridge but check frequently to see that it\ndoesn't become too hard .\n\n\nIf it does , you  ' ll have to let it soften again .\n\n\nIt has to be at the right consistency (  firm but malleable ) - if it  ' s\ntoo hard or soft , the truffles will be difficult to shape . \n\n \n\nWhen it  ' s ready , use a teaspoon to scoop out small spoonfuls .\n\n\nUse the palm of your hands to shape the scoops into balls .\n\n\nSift cocoa powder through a sieve and roll the truffles in it to coat\nlightly . \n\n \n\nFor apple or raisin turnovers , peel apples , cut in half and\nremove core .\n\n\nQuarter .\n\n\nMelt some unsalted butter in a  saute  pan , add\nthe apples , soft brown sugar to taste , a dusting of ground cinnamon and a\nsqueeze of fresh lemon juice .\n\n\nWhen the apples start releasing their juices , turn up heat until the\napples start to caramelise .\n\n\nStir a little cornstarch into a few tablespoons of water , add to the\npan and cook until the juices thicken .\n\n\nSet aside to cool . \n\n \n\nTake a sheet of store-bought puff pastry (  they come in sheets\nabout 30cm by 30cm ) .\n\n\nCut each sheet into four squares .\n\n\nBeat an egg with a tablespoon of water .\n\n\nLightly brush two adjoining sides of each square of pastry with the\nbeaten egg .\n\n\nPut some of the apple filling on each square and fold the pastry over\nto form a triangle .\n\n\nPress the edges firmly to seal them .\n\n\nRepeat with the other squares and filling .\n\n\nBrush more of the beaten egg on the top of each triangle and sprinkle\nwith sugar , then use a sharp knife to poke several holes into the top of\neach turnover (  to allow the steam to escape ) .\n\n\nBake in preheated 180-degrees-Celsius oven until firm and golden\nbrown .\n\n\nServe hot , with rum raisin or vanilla ice cream , if desired . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Ladle for hire   \n\n\nBy  Susan Jung   susan.jung@scmp.com   \n\n \n\nWhen Harunobu Inukai is a guest chef , he insists on making\neverything , unlike Vittorio Lucariello who takes a more laid-back approach .\n\n\nPhotos: KY Cheng/Dustin Shum \n\n \n\n GUEST CHEF.  The term is part of a foodie  ' s\nvernacular , spoken with excitement when a particularly famous name is\nvisiting a local restaurant , and whose appearance may be booked out weeks ( \nsometimes months ) in advance .\n\n\nBut even when the chefs are not especially well known , a stint can\nhelp boost their reputation , taking them to the people , so to speak ,\nrather than the other way around . \n\n \n\nThe appearance of a guest chef is usually preceded by weeks of\npreparation , a flurry of e-mails and telephone calls between the chef and\nthe establishment hosting him , and a publicity campaign to announce the\nvisit .\n\n\nIt  ' s a costly project , at least for the host restaurant , which\npays for the plane fare , accommodation and the chef  ' s fees .\n\n\nSome of the more famous chefs who have visited Hong Kong in recent\nyears are Justin Quek from Les Amis and Au Jardin in Singapore (  at\nBrasserie on the Eighth at the Conrad ) and Michelin three-star chef , Paul\nBocuse , at the Regal Meridian (  now the Regal Kowloon ) . \n\n \n\nIf it  ' s so much work , why bother ?\n\n\nAqua on Hollywood Road , which in October hosted Luke Mangan from\nSalt in Sydney , is hosting Harunobu Inukai (  his guest appearance runs until\nMarch 8; after that he  ' ll be at WasabiSabi in Times Square from March 17 to\nApril 4 ) .\n\n\nAqua and WasabiSabi owner David Yeo says: \" On Monday (  the first\nday of the promotion ) two diners had Haru-san  ' s  degustation\n menu and immediately booked a table for six on Saturday . \n\n \n\n\" It  ' s costly (  to do the promotion ) &scol;

\n\n \n\nIs it a lot of work ?\n\n\n\" It depends on the chef, &rdquo; Yeo says .\n\n\n\" Luke (  Mangan ) is used to doing overseas promotions; he prepares\neverything , flies it out and so very little prep work is involved (  when he\narrives ) .\n\n\nInukai doesn't normally do this so it  ' s more problematic , he\nevolves his dishes using local produce , he  ' s learning all the time .\n\n\nWe have to fly him out earlier and work very closely with him .\n\n\nSome of the things in his style of cooking that would wow an\nAustralian audience would seem jaded to us.''\n\n\nHe cites one of the planned dishes , a taro-wrapped prawn in\n bouillabaise  , saying: \" The sauce is great , but it\nlooks like dim sum. &rdquo; \n\n \n\nInukai  ' s guest stint is unusual in that it  ' s so long - many\nchefs visit for a week or less .\n\n\nInukai came out to Hong Kong a week before his menu was available at\nAqua in order to work with Yeo on fine-tuning the dishes .\n\n\nHe can afford to stay in Hong Kong for seven weeks because he is\ncurrently without a restaurant to call his own: despite his Restaurant VII in\nSydney being highly acclaimed (  it received a score of 18/20 from the Sydney\nMorning Herald Good Food Guide and has served former US president Bill\nClinton among other A-listers ) , the establishment failed to pull in enough\ncustomers and was closed in November by its Singaporean owner , EJ Ang . \n\n \n\nThis being only Inukai  ' s second guest appearance - he last year\nparticipated in the World Gourmet Summit food festival in Singapore - he is\nfeeling the pressure .\n\n\n\" I get in at 10am; I  ' m the first one in , &rdquo; he says .\n\n\n\" I trust me; I teach (  the other chefs ) . . . but people come here\nto eat my food , which means I must make and taste everything .\n\n\nI make all the sauces myself , I know them , my memory is here (  he\npoints to his tongue). &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe chef , born in Nagano and trained in French cuisine with no\nless a culinary icon than Joel Robuchon (  Inukai was chef de partie at\nRobuchon  ' s Taillevent in Tokyo ) , describes his food as \" French technique\nwith Japanese influence .\n\n\nI learned (  Japanese food ) from my mother and father and the French\ntechnique from master chefs .\n\n\nIt  ' s an unusual combination . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nBecause he  ' s Japanese and working in Sydney , his name is often\nmentioned alongside that of another hugely influential chef , Tetsuya Wakuda\n, whom Inukai calls \" a world chef , one of the top 10 , I think &rdquo; . \n\n \n\n\" His cooking , to me , is more Japanese - maybe 10-15 per cent\nFrench , the rest is Japanese, &rdquo; he adds .\n\n\n\" My food is almost 90 per cent French technique , the rest is\nJapanese. &rdquo; \n\n \n\nFar from being the temperamental chef who believes his is the\nonly way (  although when I ask if he ever yells , he laughs and says\nevasively , \" It  ' s my job' ' ) , Inukai is receptive to input from his host .\n\n\n\" I changed my mind (  about what to cook ) after I came here .\n\n\nI don't know Hong Kong tastes and I didn't know what the markets\nwould have .\n\n\nI would make two or three sauces and David would decide on the\ncombination .\n\n\nThey  ' re still my recipes , so no worries. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nVittorio Lucariello \n\n \n\nNearby at Gaia , Vittorio Lucariello was making a three-day\nguest appearance (  his promotion ended yesterday ) .\n\n\nBorn in Aversa near Napoli , Lucariello worked at the Michelin\nthree-star Don Alfonso and moved to Los Angeles as a consultant chef .\n\n\nHe is now chef of Il Cielo in Beverly Hills , where he cooks for the\nrich and shameless . \n\n \n\nHe has an advantage over Inukai in that he  ' s been making guest\nappearances for about six years .\n\n\nTo make it even easier , he doesn't have to teach chefs a unique\ncuisine - Lucariello is an Italian making a guest appearance at an Italian\nrestaurant .\n\n\nHe makes it sound easy .\n\n\n\" We  ' re professional .\n\n\nI explain (  to the other cooks ) what I want but the technique is\nalready there . \n\n \n\n\"  (  Gaia executive chef ) Paolo Monti and I planned the menu a\nmonth before .\n\n\nI sent him the information on the courses we  ' re going to do , what\nhe has to buy .\n\n\nHe can get pretty much everything;

{"text": "Eva Kit Wah Man  \n\n\nCONTEMPORARY FEMINIST BODY THEORIES AND MENCIUS  ' s IDEAS OF BODY AND\nMIND  \n\n\nCONTEMPORARY FEMINIST READING OF THE \" ONTOLOGICAL &rdquo; BODY\n\n\n \n\nMost recently , feminist philosophers and biologists have been\ntrying to destabilize the notion of \" biological sex . &rdquo;\n\n\nJudith Butler is one of the former :\n\n\nHer famous argument is that the body positioned as prior to the sign\nis always \" posited &rdquo; or \" signified &rdquo; as \"\nprior &rdquo; and \" precedes &rdquo; its own action .\n\n\nIf this is so , then there should not be a mimetic or representational\nstatus of language or signs that follow bodies , for the body is only\nsignified as prior to signification .   \n\n\nThe positing process also constitutes and conditions the \"\nmateriality &rdquo; of the body .\n\n\nShe states that what enables this positing is a problematic gendered\nmatrix that ontologizes and fixes the \" irreducible &rdquo; materiality\ninto a plethora of taken-for-granted discourses on sex and sexuality . \n  \n\n \n\nWe can sketch at least a few ways these discourses are conducted .\n\n\nFirst , as Luce Irigaray argues , inasmuch as a distinction between\nform and matter is offered within phallogocentrism , there is an exclusion of\nthe \" female . &rdquo;\n\n\nWithin the masculine-female ( form-matter ) binary ,\nthe masculine in fact occupies both poles , and the female is not an\nintelligible term .\n\n\nIrigaray further argues that the \" female &rdquo; is\narticulated through a further materiality acting as the impossible necessity\nthat enables any ontology .   \n\n\nSecond , aside from philosophy , the binding , forming , and\ndeforming of gendered bodies through social prohibitions and the so-called\ncultural intelligibility criteria of sex also constitute and regulate the\nfields of bodies .\n\n\nAccording to Moira Gatens , the body politic uses the human body as\nits image , model , or metaphor .\n\n\nThe body politic uses one type of body ( male ) to\nsignify various items : diverse bodies &semi; the oppositions of the \"\nself &rdquo; to others &semi; and many forms of oppressive ideologies .\n\n\nAll human bodies are part of these systems of exchange ,\nidentification , and mimesis .   \n\n\nIn addition , medical discourses have so far maintained the hegemony\nof heteropolarity by mapping differences onto bodies that illustrate gender ,\nthereby eliding Foucault  ' s suggestion of sociopolitical construction of\nbodies under particular kinds of needs and desires .  \n\n\n\nGatens concludes that the recent presiding question is this :\n\n\nHow does culture construct the body so that it is understood as a\nbiological given .   \n\n\nThe history of the representation of anatomical differences between\nman and woman is independent of the actual structure of organs or of what was\nknown about them .\n\n\nIdeologies determined how bodies were seen and which differences\nwould matter .   \n\n\nTherefore , a reevaluation of the importance of the body is to be\nconducted in wider arenas , and not merely within feminist social theory ,\nbut in terms of the analysis of class , culture , and consumption .  \n\n\n\nCultural Construction of Female Bodily Existence  \n\n \n\nHow does the above increase our understanding of how the female\nbody is constructed ?\n\n\nThe return to biological essentialism is strongly contested because\n\" physical experiences &rdquo; do not make someone a woman &semi;\nrather , identity as a woman depends on the specific social regulatory ideals\nby which female bodies are trained and formed .\n\n\nWe can at least include in our consideration the categories of\neconomy , politics , heterosexuality , philosophy , and subject and object\nrelations .\n\n\nEconomically , Judith Butler points out , the female must be the\nsubordinate term in a binary opposition of masculine-female for that economy\nto operate .   \n\n\nPolitically , women are constructed as incapable of performing\nmilitary service and therefore incapable of defending the political body from\nattack .\n\n\nThis is sufficient to exclude them from active citizenship .\n\n\nThe neutral body assumed by the liberal state is implicitly a\nmasculine body .   \n\n\nThe worst social operation is to treat a woman  ' s speech and her\nbehavior as hysterical ( rooted in the Greek work  hystera  ,\nmeaning uterus ) , thereby confining women to the biological .\n\n\nPhilosophically , Moira Gatens argues that traditional philosophical\nconceptions of corporeality are counterproductive to the attempt to construct\nan autonomous conception of women  ' s bodies .\n\n\nIn our culture , every woman is normatively defined as the opposite\nand complement of man .    \n\n \n\nIt is interesting to read the philosophical metaphors of woman  ' s\nbody proposed by contemporary philosophers .\n\n\nIris Young has summarized Simon de Beauvoir  ' s account of woman  ' s\nexistence in the world as a tension between immanence and transcendence .\n\n\nInfluenced by Maurice Merleau-Ponty  ' s account of the \" normal\n&rdquo; relationship between human bodies and their environment in actions ,\nYoung states that bodily action in the world is commonly distinguished by\nthree features : \" ambiguous transcendence , &rdquo; \" inhibited\nintentionality , &rdquo; and \" discontinuous unity . &rdquo;\n\n\nYoung suggests that women often \" live &rdquo; their bodies in\n\" ambiguous transcendence &rdquo; : transcendence in the sense that the\nlived body continuously calls forth capacities applied to the world that\nwomen used to refrain from .\n\n\nFemale bodily existence is an \" inhibited intentionality\n&rdquo; that simultaneously reaches toward a projected end with an \" I\ncan &rdquo; and withholds its full bodily commitment to that end in a\nself-imposed \" I cannot . &rdquo;\n\n\n\" Discontinuous unity &rdquo; is inspired by Merleau-Ponty  ' s\nsuggestion that in the enactment of intentions , the body is not an object in\nitself , but for women , there is a sense that the body is indeed a \"\nsubject &rdquo; as well as an \" object &rdquo; .\n\n\nThe female body is the object of the gaze of others and an object\nfrequently experienced as limited and limiting .\n\n\nYoung said it is important to recognize the specific and historically\nchanging forms of restrictions that have been placed on women  ' s movement ,\nincluding such things as restrictive clothing and constricting conventions\nabout female deportment and demeanor .\n\n\nShe said that these modalities do not remain constant but are\nculturally variable , subject to changing circumstances and lifestyle . \n \n\n\nThese restrictions have even acted as a guide to ( and\nprescription for ) women  ' s mental health , and the very pursuit of\nthe physical standards imposed may actually cause depression , low\nself-esteem , eating disorders and , generally , poor mental health . \n    \n\n\nTraditional Western Philosophies Reexamined  \n\n \n\nIn this essay , we are interested in the traditional\nphilosophical conceptions of corporeality that Gatens has cited .\n\n\nFeminist scholars usually begin with Plato , who proposed the\ndualisms of form-matter , mind-body , and asserted that the body interferes\nwith , and is a danger to , the operations of reason .\n\n\nHe claimed that the word body (  soma  ) was\nintroduced by Orphic priests , who believed that man is a spiritual or\nnoncorporeal being trapped in the body , the  soma  .\n\n\nHis discourse on the  hypodoche  is viewed as pertaining to\nmateriality , that when nature receives form as a sensible object , \"\nher &rdquo; proper function is to receive , take , accept , welcome , include\n, and even comprehend .\n\n\n\" She &rdquo; has no proper shape and is not a body .\n\n\nThe receptacle principle , which applies universally , is then\nassociated with the female , which is constructed as a nonthematizable\nmateriality , but which never resembles either the formative principle or\nthat which it creates .\n\n\nHence , as the receptacle , the female is a nonliving , shapeless\nnonthing , which cannot even be named , leading to the prohibition of the\nfemale body as a human form .    \n\n \n\nThe consequent social implications to both women and corporeality\nare thus often negative , and function conceptually to undergird culturally\nvalued terms such as reason , civilization , and progress .\n\n\nIn Gatens  ' s analysis , many philosophers have seen the soul or mind\nas sexually neutral , and the apparent differences among minds are generally\nseen to be due to the influence of the passions of the body .\n\n\nThis element of sensuous and passionate corporeality enables\nphilosophers to maintain the essential neutrality of the mind while allowing\nfor individual and sexual differences .\n\n\nThe most superior minds are said to suffer least from the intrusions\nof the body .   \n\n\nGatens further points out that this dualist notion of the body\ninvolves an implicit alignment between women and irrationality .\n\n\nThe ideal conception of the rational is , in other words ,\narticulated in direct opposition to qualities typical of the female . \n  \n\n \n\nMany feminists are critical of the way Ren\u00e9 Descartes\ndistinguished two kinds of substances , a thinking substance ( \nres cogitans  , mind ) from an extended substance ( \nres extensa  , body ) , and the way that he believed that the\nlatter is governed by its physical laws and ontological exigencies , while\nthe mind has no place in the natural world .\n\n\nHe thus placed the mind in a position of hierarchical superiority\nover and above nature , including the nature of the body .\n\n\nThe critical questions feminists address to Cartesianism include :\n\n\nHow can something that inhabits space affect or be affected by\nsomething that is nonspatial ?\n\n\nHow can consciousness ensure the body  ' s movements , its receptivity\nto conceptual demands and requirements ?\n\n\nHow can the body inform the mind of its needs and wishes .\n\n\nHow is bilateral communication possible ?   \n\n\nCartesianism is also criticized as a form of reductionism , denying\nany interaction between mind and body , instead focusing on the actions of\neither one of the binary terms at the expense of the other . \n\n \n\nFeminist scholars can identify at least three lines of\ninvestigation of the body in contemporary thought that may be regarded as\nlegacies of the Cartesian view , which treat the body as primarily an object\nfor : ( 1 ) the natural sciences , particularly for the life\nsciences , biology , and medicine &semi; ( 2 ) as an instrument\nor a machine at the disposal of consciousness or allocating an animating ,\nwillful subjectivity &semi; and ( 3 ) as a vehicle of\nexpression of private thoughts and feelings , that is , as fundamentally\npassive and transparent .   \n\n\nAnother ramification of Cartesian dualism is that the male-female\nopposition has been closely allied with that of the mind-body binary .\n\n\nThe conventional reading is that the mind is equivalent to the\nmasculine , and body to the feminine , excluding women as possible subjects\nof knowledge .\n\n\nBy implication , then , women  ' s bodies are presumed to be incapable\nof men  ' s achievements &semi; they are viewed as weaker , more prone to\n( hormonal ) irregularities , intrusions , and\nunpredictabilities .      \n\n\nToward an Open-Ended Ontology  \n\n \n\nRecently , feminist scholars are seriously thinking of a new\nconceptual model that can displace Cartesian dualism and that can emancipate\nnotions of the body from Cartesian dominant mechanistic models and metaphors .\n\n\nIn this light , we review traditional and contemporary alternatives .\n\n\n \n\nSome suggest as an alternative the writings of Baruch Spinoza ,\nwhose monism is a revision of Cartesian dualism .\n\n\nIn Spinoza , there is a multivalent ontology , that has been\nneglected in Anglo-American philosophy .   \n\n\nFor Spinoza , matter and mind emerge from one underlying process\n-; or  substantia  -; that is materially grounded in\nextension but is also absolute and infinite , and at the same time has mental\nattributes .\n\n\nMind and body emerge from and belong to the same substance .\n\n\nOne reading of Spinoza  ' s monism is that the body is not part of\npassive nature ruled by an active mind but rather that the body is the\ninseparable terrain of human action .\n\n\nIn contrast to the philosophical traditions mentioned , the mind is\nconstituted by the affirmation of the actual existence of the body , which\nenables the activity of reason .\n\n\nActivity should be understood as one  ' s participation in one  ' s\nsituation which , instead of being dominated by the mind , depends on the\nbody  ' s character , manner , and context .\n\n\nFeminists recognize Spinoza  ' s account of the body as a process .\n\n\nThe body  ' s meaning and capabilities will vary according to its\ncontext , and its limits and possibilities can be revealed only by its\nongoing interactions with its environment .    \n\n \n\nAs Gatens suggests , the implication of Spinoza  ' s model is that\nin contrast to the essentialist position , its nonmechanical and\nnondichotomized view of nature and culture could acknowledge the cultural and\nhistorical specificity of bodies .\n\n\nWhat Spinoza contributes to feminist politics is that sexual\ndifference does not necessarily mean gender difference &semi; gender\ndifferences ( behavioral and affective ) are different patterns\nof relationality in a nature that is transformative and constituted by modes\nof power relations .\n\n\nThe role of mother or wife thus refers to a historically specific\nbody that recreates itself in a reduced sphere of activity and social\nconditions .    \n\n \n\nBesides Spinoza , feminists also turn to the phenomenological\nreflection on the body , especially to the idea that a subject is not\nseparated from the world or the mind from body , matter , and space .\n\n\nMerleau-Ponty  ' s theory of body is predominant in feminist thought :\n\n\nThe subject is a \" being-to-the-world . &rdquo;\n\n\nMerleau-Ponty begins with a fundamental presumption that stands in\ncontrast to Cartesian dualism of mind and body .\n\n\nIn Merleau-Ponty  ' s paradigm , mind and body are necessarily\ninterrelated &semi; consciousness and nature are related , as are interiority\nand exteriority .\n\n\nThe body and the modes of sensual perception that occur through it\naffirm the necessary connections of consciousness because it is incarnated\nand always grounded on corporeal and sensory relations .\n\n\nFeminist scholars recognize in Merleau-Ponty  ' s construct that the\nbody is both object for others and a lived reality for the subject .\n\n\nAt the same time it is \" sense-bestowing &rdquo; and \"\nform-giving , &rdquo; providing structure , organization , and ground within\nwhich objects are to be situated , against which the body-subject is\npositioned an by which meaning is generated .\n\n\nThus , the primary origins of human action reside not in thought but\nin movement and motility .\n\n\nThe inspiring notion is that consciousness is in the first place not\na matter of \" thinking &rdquo; but rather of capability .\n\n\nThe most fundamental and essential ability is the fact that body\ninhabits spaces and that the objects in it and the possible movements of the\nbody are integrated in an overall orientation toward action in the world .\n\n\nAccording to Merleau-Ponty , the life of consciousness is subvented\nby an \" intentional arc &rdquo; based on the body as a nexus of lived\nand related meanings .\n\n\nHe concluded by giving an ontological priority to certain kinds of\nimmediate bodily movements and actions .\n\n\nThis attracts feminist politics as a meaningful alternative to\nCartesian dualism . \n\n \n\nThe body has remained a conceptual blind spot in both mainstream\nWestern philosophical thought and contemporary feminist theories .\n\n\nTo summarize our discussion , the human subject has long been\nregarded as composed by several related binaries : mind and body , sense and\nsensibility , outside and inside , self and other , depth and surface ,\nreality and appearance , mechanism and vitalism , transcendence and immanence\n, temporality and spatiality , psychology and physiology , form and matter ,\nand so on .\n\n\nThis binary thinking hierarchizes and ranks two polarized terms so\nthat one becomes privileged , and the other is suppressed , subordinated ,\nand negated .\n\n\nThe body is typically regarded as passive and reproductive but\nlargely unproductive .\n\n\nThe situation is more complicated when the body is associated with\nthe \" female . &rdquo;\n\n\nIt has even been proposed that it is in the West and in our time\nthat the female body has been constructed not only as a lack or absence , but\nas a formlessness that engulfs all form , a disorder that threatens all order .\n  \n\n\nThough some claim that what needs to be changed are attitudes ,\nbeliefs , and values rather than the body itself , Elizabeth Grosz points out\nthat culture itself assumes meaning and value in terms of its own other\n( s ) .   \n\n\nThis explains why there is a refusal to transgress the mind-body\nbinary by proposing its substitution by monism or by a noncontradictory and\nnonhierarchized relation between the binarized terms . \n\n \n\nIt is not clear whether the holistic or monistic positions\nsuggested can really resolve the mind-body problem .\n\n\nGrosz has concisely summarized the feminist questions , which\ninclude :\n\n\nBy which techniques and presumptions is a nonbinary understanding of\nthe body possible ?\n\n\nWhat , ideally , could a feminist philosophy of the body avoid , and\nwhat must it take into consideration ?\n\n\nWhich criteria and goals should govern a feminist theoretical\napproach to concepts of the body ?\n\n\nThe answers would certainly avoid the division of the subject into\nmutually exclusive categories of mind and body .\n\n\nBut what is more profitable , as Grosz suggests , is to remain\nsuspicious of the holism and unity implied by monism .\n\n\nBecause the notion of corporeality and the ways materiality can be\nconceptualized are still under the constraints of our culture , new concepts\nof corporeality that go beyond the regime of dualism should be developed .\n\n\nThe new notions from her recent reflections are those that view\nhuman materiality as continuous with organic and inorganic matter , where\nphysical and linguistic materialities interact and make possible a\nmaterialism beyond a mechanical physicalism , and that then will reorient\nphysics itself .   \n\n\nThis new model must show some sort of internal or constitutive\narticulation , or even disarticulation , between the biological and the\npsychological , the inside and the outside of the body , while avoiding a\nreductionism of mind to brain .   \n\n\nMerleau-Ponty  ' s notion of the flesh is thus regarded as inspiring ,\nacting as the elementary , precommunicative ontological domain out of which\nboth subject and object mutually interact and develop .\n\n\nFinally , the new conceptual categories should also comprehend\ndifferences .\n\n\nWhen applied to cultural impositions , these categories should\nrepresent and comprehend bodies as a multiple field of possible body \"\ntypes &rdquo; : young and old , black and white , male and female , animal\nand human , inanimate and animate , no one of which (  pace \n, the male ) would stand in for or represent the others .\n\n\nTo conclude , this article stresses that there exist alternative\nontologies and modes of metaphysics that , as Christine Battersby suggests ,\nare more useful for rethinking female identities .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "677dc7d5-a67a-4524-b76b-bec60eb3e574", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.949525+00:00"}

{"text": "Plus! puts some pizazz into XP \n\n\n \n\nIf you are bored with the hills-and clouds interface of Windows XP\n, then a copy of Microsoft  ' s latest Plus! package might be for you . \n\n \n\nThe newly released Microsoft Plus! Digital Media Edition (  or\nPlus! DME ) , turns Window XP  ' s blue feel into a cool digital-entertainment\nplatform with mixed results . \n\n \n\nThe new version of Plus! adds a selection of colours and\ncustomisable features to Windows XP . \n\n \n\nOne such feature is Photo Story , a video slideshow program that\nworks like a digital photo album creator .\n\n\nIt runs on top of Windows Media Player 9 , and allows users to add\nnarration , music , zooming and panning to Jpeg images .\n\n\nUsers can send the finished digital slide show to others by e-mail .\n\n\n \n\nPhoto stories are saved as Windows Media Video files and can be\nburned to VCDs . \n\n \n\nThe Plus! pack also includes an analogue recorder for converting\nold vinyl and tape recordings into compressed Windows Media Audi (  WMA ) files .\n\n\nTo use this recording feature , audio cables must be used to connect\nthe record player to the computer  ' s sound card . \n\n \n\nThe application then takes control and will record for a\nspecified period of time , automatically detect and split tracks , reduce\nhiss and pop , and allow the user to add title and artist information to each\nsong . \n\n \n\nPlus! DME can also record from microphone input , and no\ncomplaints about the sound quality . \n\n \n\nThe CD Label Maker let users create and print colourful\ncustomised CD labels , inserts and booklets .\n\n\nIt automatically adds artist , track and album information . \n\n \n\nLike its sister software , MovieMaker , which shipped with XP ,\nPlus! DME has been fitted with effects , text titles and transitions . \n\n \n\nAnother addition to the suite id Party Mode , a feature that adds\nsecurity to a jukebox so that user can view song titles , edit playlists and\nadd visual effects without getting access to other programs or data on the PC .\n\n\n \n\nPlus! DME has a full-functioned alarm clock that can rouse\npeople from slumber by playing user-selected tracks from the Media Player .\n\n\n \n\nThe software package also includes Sync &ampersand; Go , a feature for\npocket PCs . Content users want updated when they sync their pocket PCs is\nchosen from Media Player playlists , and a meagre list of audio and video is\ndownloaded to their handhelds . Once selected , Sync &ampersand; Go then automatically\nsynchronises the content . \n\n \n\nMicrosoft Plus! Digital Media Edition is available from most\nlocal software retailers for about HK&dollar;160 , great value for anyone\nweary of the original XP desktop . \n\n \n\n Margaret Chan   \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Plugged In   \n\n\n Confused by your TV options ?\n\n\nGet your CNN , Cartoon Network or \" porn pack &rdquo; with satellite\nand cable .   \n\n \n\nHong Kong is a city of almost seven million people , but\nstrangely enough , there are only four domestic free TV channels .\n\n\nLike most things in life , if you want more , you  ' ll have to pay for\nit .\n\n\nA satellite antenna or an optical cable connected to your television\nset will bring you everything from the latest news on the BBC , to mating\ngames on the Discovery Channel and Powerpuff Girls on the Cartoon Network -\nbut it  ' s going to cost  ' ya .  \n\n\n The Underground  \n\n \n\nFor most people who live in this city , the easiest way to get\nyour daily does of market news from Bloomberg before heading for work is by\ncable .\n\n\n Cable TV   (  183-2888; www.wharfcable.com )  ,\nis a subsidiary of the local conglomerate Wharf Holdings , was launched in\n1993 .\n\n\nIt holds a monopoly on Hong Kong  ' s cable television service and\nprovides a mix of local programs and international channels .\n\n\nIts basic package has 29 channels including AXN , BBC World , CCTV ,\nChannel NewsAsia , CNN , Discover , ESPN , MTV and National Geographic .\n\n\nIt costs &dollar;600 for installation , plus a monthly fee of\n&dollar;298 for the package , and an additional &dollar;30 for an analogue\nconverter rental (  the black box that sits on top of the TV ) . \n\n \n\nThey also provide several other packages to accommodate everyone  ' s\nviewing needs .\n\n\nThe Zee Pack (  &dollar;248/month ) offers four Indian channels - Zee\nTV , Zee News , Zee Cinema , Zee Music; the International Pack ( \n&dollar;168/month ) has five channels including NHK World Premium from Japan ,\n Arirang  TV form Korea , TV5 from France , \nDeutsche Welle  from Germany and TVE from Spain .\n\n\nThere  ' s also a \" porn pack , &rdquo; or what they discretely\ncall the CAT6 Pack (  &dollar;198 ) which brings you 10 channels of adult\nentertainment from around the world . Lastly you can add premium channels to\nyour service , including HBO (  &dollar;80 ) , Cinemax (  &dollar;80 ) and Star\nMovies (  &dollar;80 ) .   \n\n\n In the Air  \n\n \n\nFor those who live in the more remote parts of the city , in\napartments older than your average Chinese politician , or in buildings that\ndon't have an in-built network , Cable TV also provides another service\ncalled the  Cable Express  .\n\n\nThis broadcasts by microwave and requires the installation of a dish\nantenna (  approximately 10 inches in diameter ) , and a decoder for you to\nreceive the channels .\n\n\nBefore installation , however , Cable Express will have to send a\nsite engineer to your house (  free of charge ) to check out whether or not\ntheir signal can reach you area .\n\n\nIf he gives you the go-ahead , you  ' ll be shelling out between\n&dollar;2,0900-&dollar;6,000 for the installation .  \n\n\n Outer Space  \n\n \n\nTo get the most out of your remote , you  ' ll want to go with\nsatellite TV because it offers the most channels .\n\n\nYou might be surprised to know that installing your own satellite\nantenna and receiving unencrypted TV channels flowing in the air (  i.e .\nCCTV ) is actually legal - provided it  ' s only for private use and only in one\nhousehold .\n\n\nYou should also know , however , that satellite reception is\nrestricted to places where there is a clear sky view . \n\n \n\nFor most of us who live in multi-story buildings , the best and\ncheapest way to receive satellite TV programs is to get all the residents of\nyour building or the property owners to agree on installing one single\nsatellite master antenna television (  SMATV ) system to serve the whole\nbuilding .\n\n\nA SMATV system typically consists of one of more satellite receiving\ndish antennas installed on the rooftop of a building .\n\n\nThe signals received by these antennas are distributed by cable to\nindividual households within the building . \n\n \n\nThe system can only be installed , maintained and operated by\ncompanies holding a SMATV license issued by the  Office of the\nTelecommunications Authority   (  29/F , Wu Chung House , 213 Queen  ' s\nRoad East , Wanchai , www.ofta.gov.hk )  , where you can find a list of\nthese 73 companies and their quoted rates .\n\n\nOne of the licensees ,  PCCW   (  ask for Mr . Lee at\n2577-9211 or po-leung.lee@pccw.com )  , charges &dollar;20,000 to\n&dollar;100,000 for installing the system including foundation design and\nequipment . \n\n \n\nIf you  ' re one of the luck few with a house and garden , \nIntro-Tech Technology Ltd .   (  2544-8328; www.introtech.com.hk)\n offers a Direct-to-Home (  DTH ) installation package of &dollar;12,800\nwhich includes equipment , a one-year warranty , and a selection of 40\nchannels including BBC , Japan BS , Thaicom UBC and more . \n\n \n\nOne of the domestic pay-television program service providers ,\n TV Plus (  HK ) Corp . Ltd .   (  2723-2829 ,\nwww.tvplus.com.hk )  , also provides DTH satellite service with one\nJapanese (  JET TV ) and nine Taiwanese channels .\n\n\nAnd with their 45-centimeter dish antenna , you can easily install it\non your balcony or hang it on the outside wall of your building (  but you\nneed permission from your landlord ) .\n\n\nThe installation fee is &dollar;900 , and there is a &dollar;59\nmonthly service charge , as well as a &dollar;30 monthly rental fee for the\nantenna , the decoder box and a smartcard (  you can also buy the equipment\nfor &dollar;900 ) . \n\n \n\n Q Lam  \n\n \n\n Can't cope with some practical aspect of Hong Kong life ?\nEmail questions to coping@asia-city.com.hk  \n\n\n\n \n\n\nMobile Madness   \n\n\nFor some , acquiring the next generation of cell is an obsession .\nSherry Lee meets the mobile maniacs who can't stand being one model behind\n\n\n \n\n CHIU CHI-WAI  has an expensive habit .\n\n\nHis first of many \" hits &rdquo; took place in 1993; then they came\nat eight-month intervals .\n\n\nSoon they were as regular as every three months .\n\n\nNow they may happen once a week . His drug of choice ?\n\n\nMobile phones . \n\n \n\n\" I am addicted , &rdquo; he acknowledges , laughing about\nhis tendency to trade in his most recent purchase simply to buy the latest on\nthe market .\n\n\nBut he is less blithe in admitting his mobile-phone mania means he\nhas had to go home to his wife and parents broke on pay day , or is in debt\nto his family . \n\n \n\nThe 28-year-old decorator says he can't help but ditch his old\nphone when a new model comes out , even though he realises the changes are\nsometimes incremental; a blue screen (  instead of a colourless one ) , say ,\nor a 2mm difference in size .\n\n\nHe is sometimes also pulled in by ads .\n\n\nIf he likes the movie star featured in a movie-phone campaign , for\ninstance , he must have the product . \n\n \n\nChiu is not alone .\n\n\nHe is part of a growing group of people in Hong Kong whose phones\nchange with the seasons .\n\n\nAccording to Smartone executive director Patrick Chan Kai-ling , the\naverage time mobile-phone users keep their handsets has fallen from 18 months\nlast year to nine to 12 months now . \n\n \n\nThat is twice as fast as in the mid-1990s , when the replacement\nrate was roughly once every two years , says Jeanette Tan Ai-lin , events and\npublic-relations manager for Motorola Asia Pacific .\n\n\nMobile-phone salespeople have not only noticed the trend , but are\nhoping it continues .\n\n\n\" Whenever a new model comes out , people flock in to trade in\ntheir old ones , &rdquo; says Michael Wong of the Causeway Bay branch of\nBroadway .\n\n\nThe salesman says that up to 60 per cent of customers trade in their\nphones every six months , while some do so as frequently as every two weeks .\n\n\n \n\nAmong those who upgrade at least twice a year are the friends of\nuniversity student Vincent Luk Wing-hei .\n\n\nThe 21-year-old says about eight of them change mobiles every three\nto six months , including a 17-year-old From Five student who buys the\nhandsets with his pocket money .\n\n\nIt is an affordable habit , Luk says , explaining that they don't go\nfor the high-end models , paying about &dollar;600 per new phone every months .\n\n\n\" That  ' s just &dollar;100 a month , &rdquo; he reasons . \n\n \n\nAccording to the Office of Telecommunications Authority , there\nare 602 million mobile phones users in Hong Kong .\n\n\nThe office does not track the number of \" handset switchers\" ,\nhowever , nor does it have a profile of this group . \n\n \n\nBut Chan says Chiu and Luk are typical of most phone and mad\nswitchers , who are generally in the trend-conscious 20- to 40-year-old age\nbracket .\n\n\nThe trend first appeared in Hong Kong about three years ago , Wong\nsays , as mobiles became palm-sized .\n\n\nOther factors feeding the phone-swap mania include providers to\ncustomers buying new handsets , the increased convenience of trading in\nmobile phones , and the rise in choice of products and lower prices that have\ntailed the scores of new brands entering the market .\n\n\nHong Kong  ' s mobile-phone penetration rate is among the highest in\nthe world , says Smartone (  which declines to reveal what happens to the old\nphones that are traded in ) .\n\n\nAs in other parts of Asia , such as Taiwan (  where the replacement\nrate is 18 months ) and Singapore (  two years ) , says Tan , there  ' s also the\nattraction of young consumers to new technology and style .\n\n\nChan adds that phone markers have made an effort to turn mobiles from\nsimply communication tools to \" trendy fashion items &rdquo; sporting\nan increasing number of bells and whistles .\n\n\nApart from their basic function , mobile phones now take and send\nphotos and can be used for e-mails and games .\n\n\nThere are also hybrid personal digital assistant/mobile phones known\nas smart phones , which allow Internet access . \n\n \n\n\" Consumers are rational and smart , &rdquo; says Emily\nHung Wai-yi , assistant marketing manager of Nokia Hong Kong .\n\n\n\" We just give them choices and they make a decision based on\ntheir needs . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nTan agrees , adding that to survive against fierce competition ,\ncompanies have to launch new products regularly .\n\n\nBut it is an endless cycle for both manufacturers and consumers of\nkeeping up with the Joneses ,\n\n\n\" On average , Asians replace handsets more often than any\nother region in the world , &rdquo; Tan says . \n\n \n\nPeter Leung Shou-chi , for instance , has owned 500 to date .\n\n\n\" Sometimes I buy three phones in a day , costing me\n&dollar;10,000.\n\n\nMy record is 20 phones in a month . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nWhy does the South China Athletics Association executive director\ndo it ?\n\n\n\" I like mobile phone , &rdquo; the 49-year-old says simply ,\nadding that he gives away his old phones and pointing out that many of his\nstaff have a similar passion . \n\n \n\nHistorian Robert Ferguson says \" mobile phones are not our\ncity  ' s only technological style statement\" .\n\n\nThe assistant professor at Hong Kong University of Science and\nTechnology  ' s Social Science department , who has studied the history of\ntechnology , says Hong Kong people \" also pay close attention to trends\nin wrist-watches , and they maintain their cars in sparkling condition\" .\n\n\n \n\nWhat lies beneath this urge to replace new phones ?\n\n\n\" It reflects people  ' s lack of self-confidence that they have\nto use a phone to show what they  ' re worth .\n\n\nIt also reflects the emptiness in the lives of our young\ngeneration,: says psychiatrist Chan Chung-mau .\n\n\n\" They chase material things to fill in their emotional void , to\nshow off . &rdquo;\n\n\nChiu acknowledges he loves being the first of his friends to have\nthe latest mobile phone .\n\n\n\" Whenever my friends have new handsets , I feel embarrassed to use\nmine , &rdquo; he says , adding that a 24-year-old curtain-maker friend\nchanges his mobile very three to four months to play new games downloaded\nfrom Web sites .\n\n\nHe adds that buying the phones gives him a sense of satisfaction .\n\n\n\" With a new handset , I feel like I  ' m wearing a new set of\nclothes , &rdquo; he says .\n\n\n\" I feel cool and trendy . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nEstimating he spends 30-40 per cent of his annual\n&dollar;120,000 income on mobile phones , he admits he has lost count of the\nnumber of mobiles he  ' s owned - though he reckon it  ' s about 20 , since his\nfirst in 1993 .\n\n\nBut he has committed his favourites to memory: Motorola 801 ,\nEricsson 337 and 388 , Nokia 6150 , Siemens C3 , and so on , which he has\ntraded in for &dollar;800 to &dollar;2000 at shops in Mongkok , on top of\nwhich he pays &dollar;1,300 to &dollar;1,500 for something new . \n\n \n\nHe parades the fact that his family , too , changes phones\nregularly .\n\n\nWhile his father is content to use \" old &rdquo; phones given\nto him , his mother purchases a new handset every three to four months and\nhis wide - who was not interested in mobile phone before their marriage last\nyear - now likes having a new one from \" time to time\" . \n\n \n\nShould there be curbs on such behaviour ?\n\n\nAs long as the practice does not affect users ' daily life - causing\nfights or leading to debt - Chan sees no reason for them to kick the habit\nwhile Ferguson says critics should realise it is just a way for people to\nexpress themselves .\n\n\nBy using a particular type of phone , he sys , people establish\ntheir individuality and gain membership to \"  avant-grade\n \" circles and tastes . \n\n \n\nWith the economic downturn eating into his income , Chiu says he\nis cutting back on his phone-related spending .\n\n\nBut then he spots an ad in a newspaper announcing Nokia  ' s 7250\npurple digital camera phone , which is marginally smaller than his present\ndevice .\n\n\nSuddenly the black Nokia 8310 he bought during Lunar New Year is not\ngood enough .\n\n\n\" I will buy the new model next month , &rdquo; he declares . \n\n \n\n sherry.lee@scmp.com", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "02d00e0b-780c-4844-8e44-f6b7774028f3", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.952275+00:00"}
{"text": "Partnership of peace  \n\n \n\nGeorge W. Bush and Vladimir Putin have not shut the door on their\nnuclear eras , but instead fostered hope that such a day may eventually dawn .\n\n\n \n\nThe signing by the US President and his Russian counterpart\nyesterday of the Treaty of Moscow nuclear disarmament pact was hailed by the\nBush administration as \" landmark &rdquo; and \" historic &rdquo; .\n\n\nIt was only the latter of these , a breakthrough in relations that\nhave been steadily warming . \n\n \n\nLandmark it was not .\n\n\nThe threat of the former bitter rivals one day firing nuclear missiles\nat one another has been put aside by handshakes and smiles .\n\n\nTheir arsenals remain active and although not as threatening , can\nstill be mobilised . \n\n \n\nIn 2012 , each will have about 2,000 active nuclear warheads and\nanother 6,000 in storage .\n\n\nThis is not disarmament , merely rearranging the war-readiness\ndeckchairs . \n\n \n\nWhat has not been achieved through treaties has been gained\nthrough photo-opportunities .\n\n\nMr Bush and Mr Putin are good friends and they clearly would like the\nsame for their countries , despite the lingering Cold War suspicions of many\nof their citizens . \n\n \n\nSpy scandals and angry words over the American plans for a\nmissile defence shield have fuelled doubts that the relationship can ever be\ncompletely pulled from the dark days of Cold War loathing . \n\n \n\nBut the September 11 terrorist attacks in the US and Russia  ' s\nstagnant economy have created an atmosphere where co-operation is mutually\nbeneficial . \n\n \n\nWashington gets Moscow  ' s diplomatic leverage over troublespots ,\nranging from the Middle East to Central Asia and the so-called \" axis\nof evil &rdquo; states of Iran , Iraq and North Korea .\n\n\nRussia gets badly-needed economic incentives , such as promises of\nincreased investment and aid and support in its aims of joining the World\nTrade Organisation . \n\n \n\nIt is a friendship based on necessity , but one which , given\ntime , has ramifications beyond the bilateral partnership it now encompasses .\n\n\n \n\nOn Tuesday , Russia also forms a new partnership with the 19\ncountries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation , which include the US .\n\n\nWhile there is doubt whether this is as significant an event as it is\nbeing billed , it is another step in Russia moving closer towards the West .\n\n\n \n\nThe collapse of the former Soviet Union created instability that\nhas not been fully calmed .\n\n\nRussian co-operation with the US and Nato will help bring peace to\nthese trouble-spots . \n\n \n\nThe US and Russia must make efforts to cut their nuclear\nstockpiles and banish the threat they pose . \n\n \n\nBut they should also strengthen their new-found partnership to\ntackle global threats such as terrorism .\n\n\nWith resolve , they can make the world less dangerous . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  The bird-flu risks  \n\n \n\nThe report by the special investigation team set up to examine\nthe bird flu outbreak earlier this year produced no real surprises .\n\n\nThis was largely because most of its recommendations had been leaked\nto the media before publication . \n\n \n\nNevertheless , the report does serve as a useful tool to\nunderline the stark choice Hong Kong faces in its fight to contain avian flu\nand , more importantly , to prevent the creation of a mutated virus that is\nable to leap the species barrier and infect humans , as happened in 1997 .\n\n\nFew people can any longer doubt the terrible danger represented by\nthis possibility .\n\n\nThe human version of bird flu does not consist of the symptoms of a\nsevere cold . It is gruesome . And it kills . \n\n \n\nMany experts predict that an outbreak in humans caused by a\nmutated avian flu virus is just a matter of time .\n\n\nAnd they warn that should such a virus really take hold , we can\nexpect the kind of global pandemic that killed tens of millions of people at\nthe end of World War I .\n\n\nExcept that this time , because of air travel , the speed the disease\ncould spread globally would be measured in hours rather than weeks . \n\n \n\nThe investigation team  ' s report states the facts bluntly: if\nchickens continue to be freshly slaughtered in wet markets , there will\nalways be a risk of an outbreak of bird flu , and a subsequent risk to humans .\n\n\n \n\nThe financial cost to Hong Kong of maintaining its traditional\nway of selling chickens are enormous .\n\n\nThe risks will be even greater .\n\n\nAs painful as the decision will be for the Government , and as\nunpopular as it will be with many people , it is time for Hong Kong to join\nthe first world .\n\n\nThe sale of live chickens in wet markets must be banned . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Secrecy must go  \n\n \n\nInevitably , each time the results of the benchmark tests for\nEnglish teaching are released debate centres on two areas: whether there\nshould be testing at all and what the results actually tell us about the\nstandards of English teaching .\n\n\nThe argument in favour of the tests is straightforward and\noverwhelming .\n\n\nThere is simply no reason why teachers in mid-career should not be\nexamined to discover whether their teaching ability is up to standard , as it\nwas at the start of their careers .\n\n\nThere are few checks on classroom performance after a teacher has\nqualified and this is simply not reasonable and is at odds with the private\nsector where employees ' performances are constantly monitored . \n\n \n\nParents and pupils will be reassured by checks and problem areas\ncan be identified .\n\n\nThe tests are not to wheedle out weak teachers - although this is one\ninevitable , and justifiable , result .\n\n\nInstead , they should be regarded as a valid method of maintaining ,\nand raising , standards of English teaching . \n\n \n\nThis year  ' s results show , once again , that problem areas are\nthe writing element of the benchmark test and also , this year in particular\n, the comprehension part .\n\n\nThese shortcomings need to be addressed . \n\n \n\nUnfortunately , when we consider what the results of the tests\ntell us about standards of teaching , the answer has to be a blunt , not much .\n\n\nThis is simply because of the way the Government chooses to collect\nand release the data . \n\n \n\nPresumably in an attempt to avoid upsetting teachers who feel\nthreatened by the tests , the specific number of serving teachers who were\nexamined is not released .\n\n\nThis year , this has had the unfortunate effect of making it appear\nas though teaching standards are falling because the results in certain areas\nwere so poor compared to last year .\n\n\nAnd yet all we know is that at least 266 of the 826 people who sat\nthe test were serving teachers .\n\n\nAs a method of discovering how good the standard of teaching is ,\nthis is far from satisfactory .\n\n\nYet , intriguingly , we also know that , of those teachers who opted\nfor classroom assessment , 90 per cent were successful .\n\n\nEven allowing for the fact that those who choose this test will be\nthose who know themselves to be competent , this result appears to be\nreassuring .\n\n\nWhat is needed , however , is for the secrecy to be removed and a\nclear breakdown of results to be released .\n\n\nOnly in this way can problem areas be effectively tackled and the\ntests be regarded as truly valid . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Defining the threat  \n\n \n\nAn intensified campaign by US President George W . Bush  ' s\nadministration to bolster support for its war against terrorism has come to\nAsia .\n\n\nThe principles being outlined by Mr Bush  ' s envoy are worthy , but\nthere must surely be implications that must be considered carefully . \n\n \n\nDeputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz  ' s visit to the region\nfollows on the heels of Mr Bush  ' s European tour , which was met with only a\nlukewarm official response . \n\n \n\nAsian defence ministers meeting in Singapore this weekend will\ndoubtless show a little more enthusiasm , given some of their governments'\neagerness for US help in climbing from an economic malaise .\n\n\nIndonesia , for one , stands to benefit from a planned resumption of\nAmerican military assistance .\n\n\nThe Philippines has already won economic aid and military assistance\nto fight Muslim separatists . \n\n \n\nMr Bush used the same approach in Russia last week , offering\nPresident Vladimir Putin financial incentives for aiding the anti-terrorism\ncampaign . \n\n \n\nEurope  ' s economic giants of Germany , France and Italy were not\nso easily swayed .\n\n\nThey have little need for financial help from the US in fighting a\nwar that is of little consequence to their stable societies . \n\n \n\nThe lessons of Afghanistan are still being learned .\n\n\nThe war there has been costly and apart from toppling a hated regime\n, has not restored the promised stability or even destroyed the Taleban or\nal-Qaeda terrorist network . \n\n \n\nMr Wolfowitz yesterday compared the battle with terrorism to\nNazism in Germany in the 1930s .\n\n\nBy ridding the world of the scourge now , he argued , would prevent\nthe emergence of a far worse scenario in the future . \n\n \n\nHe is right , but he must also more clearly define US objectives .\n\n\nThe war against terrorism is ill-defined .\n\n\nAfter Afghanistan comes Iraq and then perhaps Iran and North Korea ,\nthe other countries named by Mr Bush as an \" axis of evil\" . \n\n \n\nThese may be objectionable regimes to Mr Bush and his advisers ,\nbut not all nations see things the American way . \n\n \n\nMr Bush and his envoys can tour the world seeking opinions , but\nthere is a forum - the United Nations - which is better suited to discuss and\nact upon such important matters . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Called to account  \n\n \n\nThe political battle over the planned cut in civil service wages\nis hotting up .\n\n\nUnions and politicians who argue civil servants are taking the fall\nfor a dogmatic commitment to balanced budgets are staking out their ground .\n\n\n \n\nIt is easy to forget the wider issues at stake .\n\n\nYet half a world away in New York this week the hard edge underlying\nFinancial Secretary Antony Leung Kam-chung  ' s commitment to restore fiscal\nbalance within five years was under scrutiny . \n\n \n\nCredit rating agencies are a vital audience for any finance chief .\nWhen you are running a record budget deficit that shows little sign of\nimproving , they are especially so .\n\n\nMeeting the major players , Mr Leung reiterated his timetable for\nrestoring order to government accounts .\n\n\nThe message was the same as in his March Budget speech .\n\n\nBut having received it directly , the agencies will be expecting him\nto deliver . \n\n \n\nThe self-appointed guardians of global credit worthiness are\nrightly under the microscope due to their perceived lack of accountability .\n\n\nLast week , the Japanese Government demanded that Moody  ' s provide\nmore information on the reasons for its downgrade of the country  ' s sovereign\nrating . \n\n \n\nYet the reality is that international investors allocate funds\nand categorise risk on the basis of the economic health checks provided by\nratings agencies .\n\n\nUntil recently Hong Kong had the luxury of making public spending\nchoices without worrying about credit issues .\n\n\nLarge fiscal surpluses earned during the 1990s meant concerns centred\non the SAR  ' s political autonomy and commitment to maintain the fixed\nexchange rate system . \n\n \n\nThat has now changed and policy choices are constrained by\noutsiders ' perceptions of the Government  ' s long-term solvency .\n\n\nFormer United States president Bill Clinton famously exploded when\nadvisers told him that his first-term spending initiatives were untenable as\ninvestors would inevitably sell government bonds and force up the cost of\nborrowing . \n\n \n\nHong Kong still has fiscal reserves of &dollar;363.7 billion .\n\n\nYet , without firm action to reign in what has been officially dubbed\na structural deficit , the Government faces a similar market-imposed\nstraitjacket . \n\n \n\nOf course , seeking the blessing of New York credit agencies is\nnot the main reason for cutting civil servants ' pay .\n\n\nThat is justified on fairness grounds as wage differentials between\nthe public and private sector widen due to continuing deflation . \n\n \n\nHowever , as what is sure to be an acrimonious debate unfolds ,\nit is worth keeping in mind the international dimension .\n\n\nHong Kong is a small , open economy that must live by its wits to\nstay competitive .\n\n\nIf we fail to take action to put our accounts in order the goodwill\nbuilt up over so many years by international investors could be quickly lost .\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Time for a trim  \n\n \n\nWith a massive overhang of empty flats on private housing\nestates , the Government  ' s decision to sell only about 5,000 Home Ownership\nScheme units over the next 12 months should help stabilise the market . \n\n \n\nHouse prices have fallen for five years , forcing many home\nowners into the negative equity pit .\n\n\nWith about 50,000 new flats due to be completed over the next two\nyears , sensible steps need to be taken to arrest further erosion of values .\n\n\n \n\nThe expansion of the loan scheme for buyers of private flats is\nanother confidence-boosting measure .\n\n\nEven with this shot in the arm , prices are unlikely to climb back\nto the hysterical levels recorded in 1997 . \n\n \n\nFrom 2005/06 , the plan is to control supply of HOS flats at\nabout 2,000 a year , reflecting the Government  ' s commitment to maintain a\nresidual capacity to intervene in the market .\n\n\nSuch intervention , though theoretically undesirable , may be\nnecessary over the medium-term as developers have launched few new\nconstructions over the past few years and an under-supply could possibly\nemerge several years down the road . \n\n \n\nAs a means of rectifying the administration  ' s failure to\nengineer a soft landing for the housing market - what it did after the\nhandover actually aggravated the plunge - the measures being taken to prop up\nthe market are justified . \n\n \n\nOver the long-term , however , Hong Kong  ' s housing policy\nremains muddled .\n\n\nWill we still need the HOS , or even the home purchase loan scheme\n, in 10 years ?\n\n\nAnd should not the public rental housing scheme providing\naccommodation to half the population be scaled down or privatised ?\n\n\nIt  ' s time the government trimmed down its direct involvement in\nhousing .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "cf57a2b0-87b2-47af-95d5-2785770174a1", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.953859+00:00"}
{"text": "Lanterns of the Mid-Autumn Festival: A Reflection of Hong Kong\nCultural Change   \n\n\n Kin Wai Michael Siu   \n\n\n Mid-Autumn Festival  \n\n \n\nNo matter a hunting , a collecting , or an agricultural society ,\nthe everyday life of Chinese is closely related  nature  .\n\n\nUnder an uncertain and uncontrollable environment , Chinese in the old\ndays totally relied on the  kindness  and  giving  of\nnature (  Tao ) .\n\n\nAmong thousands of natural objects , the moon was one of the most\ndifficult things and incredible phenomena for Chinese to understand .\n\n\nOriginally , Chinese celebrated their harvest with the moon only\ninvolving the activities of family union and admiring (  watching ) the moon .\n\n\nIt was not considered as a sacred/religious (  Ho ) .\n\n\nIn fact , the English word  religion  , coming as it does\nfrom the Latin  religio  , is usually taken to signify a bond\nbetween the human and the divine .\n\n\nScholars have had difficulty applying this sense to the Chinese\ncontext , and some even go so far as to say that the dimension of\ntranscendence is itself lacking in the Chinese spiritual universe (  Ching 2 ) .\n\n\nTao also stated that the word  religion  (  tsung-chiao ) did\nnot exists in the Chinese vocabulary until late nineteenth century.  1\n \n\n \n\nNevertheless , as the degree of difficulty for understanding the\nmoon or a phenomenon of to (  e.g. , full-moon or no-moon ) increased , the\nnumber of myths  2  and activities related to it was increased\ncorrespondingly (  Eliade ) .\n\n\nTake for example , in the old days Chinese discovered that plants\ngrew at night , so people thought that moon provided life for plants .\n\n\nBesides , people did not understand why the shape of moon always\nchanged , so they associated that phenomenon to the lives of people and\nanimals .\n\n\nAlthough Chinese tried to understand the moon more and use tit as the\nmain reference for setting up a calendar , myth-creating has not stopped .\n\n\nIn contrast , while people tried to understand more about the moon ,\nmore myths and stories were created . \n\n \n\nBecause of the indispensable and closed relationship between the\nmoon and the daily life , the Chinese started to associate their primordial\ncelebration of the harvest with the moon (  Sung ) .\n\n\nIn general , autumn is the best tine for harvesting and gathering\ncrops .\n\n\nThe Chinese character of autumn also means it is a good time for\nharvesting .\n\n\nSince the Shang Dynasty (  1557-1027 BC ) , Chinese have agreed that\nthe eighth Lunar moon is the happiest day for celebrating the harvest .\n\n\nHowever , it is difficult to trace when Chinese started to call the\neighth full-moon day  3  as Mid-Autumn Festival .\n\n\nAccording to a Chinese legend ,  Tang-Ming  (  a king of the\n Moon-Palace  and he started to have great formal celebration in his\npalace (  Ching ) .  \n\n\nThe Change \n\n \n\nLater , legends were created and people tried to involve more\nmaterials , objects and events in the celebration - the Mid-Autumn Festival .\n\n\nAs a foreigner living in Peking , Lowe (  31 ) described the festival\nin his diary: \n\n \n\nThe Mid-Autumn Festival the fifteenth of the eight moon , is\nusually accompa-nied by the fine weather for at this time the moon shines\nbrightest , the sky is clear and often free from all atmospheric\ninterferences...gathering under the moon-light it is often the family &lsquo;\ns pleasure to recount legends about the moon and its imaginary inhabitants .\n\n\nSuch mythical stories based no doubt on the black spots on the face\nof the moon are legion... one such is the one about the beautiful \nChang-O  who fled to the moon.  4  \n\n \n\nGenerally , the festival consists three fundamental  meanings\n : gathering , thanksgiving , and praying (  asking for the conceptual\nand material satisfaction ) (  Tao ) .\n\n\nAccording to these meanings , different kinds of traditions and myths\nwere formed and re-enacted periodically.  5 \n\n\nAlso , most of those traditions and activities were related to the\nsupernatural beings and sacred concepts (  see Figure 1 ) .\n\n\nFor example , Chinese believed rabbits looked at the moon to induce\npregnancy and the moon could conceive shells to have pearls as brighten as\nthe moon .\n\n\nAlso , women thought that  Chang-O  was beautiful so women\nneeded to pray to her for keeping their beauty . \n\n \n\nNowadays , the meanings and the activities of the festival are\ndiffer-ent from the old days .\n\n\nFor the reason of the moon-landing , the in creased understanding of\nscience , and the influence of foreign economy , different cultures and\nreligions , Chinese started to change their concepts of the festival (  Tao ) .\n\n\nHo reminds that change has been started and continued for along time\n, but not only started at the Qing Dynasty as most of the people think that\nit is the time for China to contact with foreign countries (  Ho ) .\n\n\nHo (  182-226 ) provides a lot of examples to prove the moon-culture\nhas been changed since the New-Stone-Age .\n\n\nMoreover , these kinds of changes have not only occurred in the outer\nand the intermediate levels , but also in the inner level if the spatial\ndimension in different temporal layers*** of the mood culture (  see Figure 2&\n3 , and Table 1 )   \n\n\n Lanterns in Chinese festivals  \n\n \n\nNearly every Chinese can answer moon-cakes and lanterns as two\npopular objects - symbols - closely related to the Mid-Autumn Festival .\n\n\nFor the reason eating is important for Chinese , the traditional\nmeaning  7  and several plebeians revolution-legends  8 \nabout moon-cakes , it is not difficult to understand why Chinese has started\nto make moon-cakes since the Song Dynasty (  906-1279 AD ) and relate it with\nthe festival .\n\n\nBesides working as a lighting artifact using outdoor places it is\ndifficult to find pout a definite reason and the beginning time for lanterns\nto be used with the moon-worship activities .\n\n\nWe can only be sure that lantern was not used for the moon-worship ( \nor the Mid-Autumn Festival ) before the Tang Dynasty (  Wang ) . \n\n \n\nNevertheless , the lantern has its long history in China .\n\n\nIt is a symbol of fertility in Chinese culture besides other special\nmeanings (  Eberhard ) .\n\n\n Wen Hua Sheng Hou Sho Tse  (   The Handbook of Cultural\nLives   ) mentions lantern has been close related to the sacred and the\nculture activities for more than two thousand years (  Wen Hua Sheng Huo Sho\nTse ) .\n\n\nFor this long period of time , some of the shapes , materials\nfunctions and uses of lanterns (  outer level of the spatial dimension of the\nlantern-culture ) have been changed greatly (  see Table 2 ) .  \n\n \n\nIn the old days , the shapes and the images of lanterns were\nmainly related to the nature , myths and  local  cultures in\nindividual regions of China .\n\n\nLater , the shapes were changed and the techniques for making them\nwere matched and dissolved with other cultures\n\n\nThe appearance , forms and functions were changed from simple and\nlocal to complex and mix-cultured .\n\n\nOther arts of Chinese were also combined to the lantern design , such\nas writing blessing sentences or poems on the surface of \nlanterns .\n\n\nShih adds that nowadays there are more than fifty major types of\nlanterns used in different regions of China for different purposes with\ndifferent shapes and colors (  Shih ) . \n\n \n\nConcepts and functions of lanterns - - the inner level of the\nspatial dimension of the lantern-culture - have also been changed since the\nTang Dynasty (  Ho ) .\n\n\nFor instance , the function of lanterns involved in the Mid-Autumn\nFestival was changed from a toy as a decoration item to being a  symbol\n of the festival (  Eberhard ) .\n\n\nBecause of these differences , the variety of colors , forms , sizes\n, functions , values and the  meaning  of the activities related to\nthe festival became more and more , richer and richer .\n\n\nMoreover , concepts and activities of other Chinese festivals were\nalso transmitted or substituted into the Mid-Autumn Festival .\n\n\nTake for example , lanterns of melon-skin in the Mid-Autumn Festival\nis the transformation of the lotus-leaf lanterns in the  Chung-yuan\n ,  9  and putting lanterns on rivers in the Mid-Autumn\nFestival in Song Dynasty  10  is the identical activity in the \nChung-yuan  for guiding the spirits of those who have been drowned. \n11 \n\n\nFurthermore , lantern carnivals in the Mid-Autumn Festival nowadays\nare similar to the original activity Sheung-yuan.  12  \n\n \n\nHo (  211 ) points out that the reasons for these changes and\ntransformations are \" the gradual development of the temporal dimension\nof the Chinese culture . &rdquo;\n\n\nChinese changed their lives from a totally agricultural society to a\nmixed agricultural and commercial society .\n\n\nFor the reason of  the economic opening of China ,\nvalue judgments , concepts and religious activities of foreign countries have\nalso accelerated the changes of the temporal layers of the lantern-culture of\nChinese .  \n\n\n Lanterns of the Mid-Autumn Festival in Hong Kong  \n\n \n\nThe nature if living and the culture of Hong Kong was mainly\ninherited from China , especially the southern region of China .\n\n\nBefore the Tang Dynasty , there were virtually no people living in\nHong Kong .\n\n\nIn the Ming Dynasty (  1368-1644 AD ) , fishermen hung lanterns on\nboats for lighting only .\n\n\nIn Qing Dynasty , fishermen started to hang lanterns around their\nboats for decoration in the  Sheung-yuan  and the Mid-Autumn\nFestival .\n\n\nSame as the mainland China , originally lanterns for the Mid-Autumn\nwas nature and daily-life related .\n\n\nSince acting as a colony of UK in the past hundred years , Hong Kong\ngot a chance to open herself to interact with foreign cultures and then build\nup its distinctive culture . \n\n \n\nTable 3 shows the difference of the outer level (  the 1st level)\nof spatial dimension of the lantern-culture in Hong Kong between the several\ndecades ago and nowadays .\n\n\nThe comparison in Table 3 does not mean that object and events\nappearing in the old days (  see the 2nd column ) do not exist nowadays (  see\nthe 3rd column ) .\n\n\nIt only provides an indication that people &lsquo; s attention of the\nfestival has been changed .\n\n\nWhen looking at the lanterns of the festival , it is not difficult to\ndiscover that original/traditional lanterns are rough and self-hand-made with\ntraditional techniques .\n\n\nThe images appearance and forms if these lanterns are localized in\nstyle , while compared with the plastic  sailor-moon  image  13\n (  a popular Japanese cartoon image ) of lanterns nowadays . \n\n \n\nSince 1974 , district lantern carnivals have been introduced into\nHong Kong (  Urban Council , \" Lantern\" ) .\n\n\nThe activities with the lanterns were changed from private and family\nactivities to public and community activities ,\n\n\nThe role of lanterns in the Mid-Autumn Festival was also changed and\ndeveloped gradually from \" reinforcing the mood of the festival &rdquo;\nto \" enriching the city lives and the mood of holidays and\nentertainment . &rdquo;\n\n\nThe festival is only a reason for people to have a holiday and enrich\ntheir lives .\n\n\nThus , people may not have family gatherings because of other\nactivities.  14 \n\n\nThis phenomenon is similar to what Tao has advocated that sacred\nactivities and customary directions (  see Figure 4 ) (  Tao ) .\n\n\nThe tendency of each direction is based on the nature and the\ncharacteristics of the society .\n\n\nFor the lantern activities of the Mid-Autumn Festival in Hong Kong ,\nthe artistic direction is nearly co0vered by all of the others  though a small number of the Hong Kong people still want to keep\ntraditional customs of Chinese and intend to discover and maintain the\nbenefit of them .  \n\n\n The Cultural Change  \n\n \n\nIn order to find the reasons for the change of lanterns in the\nMid-Autumn Festival , there are four basic areas which should be considered:\nliving standard , living environment , family nature and social change .\n\n\nActually , these areas are closely-related and affected by each Other\n( see Figure 5 ) .\n\n\nWithout one of them , the situation may be totally different . \n\n \n\nAmong four basic areas , Ho (  4 ) points out that economic change\nis the most significant factor which causes changes in concepts and value\njudgment .\n\n\nConsequently , it also affects how people make choices such as\nmaterials , colors or images of an object or an event of their everyday lives .\n\n\nWhile the living standard and the living environment are changing ,\nthe value judgment of Chinese in Hong Kong is also changing .\n\n\nNowadays , most of the people are living in floats instead of hoses .\n\n\nSometimes , it is very difficult for people to see the moon , and to\nhave places for worship , though some of the elder Chinese still want to\nretain the custom of moon-worship .\n\n\nOn the other hand , it is also difficult for children to play with\nlanterns outside the houses with neighbors as was  common\ntwenty years ago .\n\n\nWhile the private spaces in private and public houses/flats are being\n increased  , the sharing and communication with neigbnors is being\n decreased  (  Fong &ampersand; Yeh ) .\n\n\nIn the old days , corridors and stairs are opened and well-\ncirculated with fresh air .\n\n\nAdults and children liked to stay and play in these environments ( \nSiu ) .\n\n\nThese kind of places seemed as stages or the \" Hyde Park\n&rdquo; for people to express and perform themselves freely .\n\n\nHowever , nowadays , air-conditioning houses/flats and\nfire-protection doors separate people in different well-sealed  boxes\n .\n\n\nEven though people meet at lift-lobbies or corridors , nodding head\nor saying a \" hello &rdquo; seems difficult and redundant .\n\n\nThus , sharing and playing with lanterns together in the old days\nseems to suddenly disappear in children &lsquo; s memory and experience .\n\n\n \n\nBesides the living conditions and environments which affect the\nlantern activities in the Mid-Autumn Festival , a shift in the roles between\nfamily and school also causes changes .\n\n\nMany of the traditional activities and parents &rsquo; duties are now\ncarried out by teachers .\n\n\nTraditionally , family-union , moon-worship , myth-telling ,\nlantern-making and playing are all the activities appearing in the home .\n\n\nHowever , nowadays , most of these activities such as telling the\nmeaning of the festival and  practicing   15  the lantern\nactivities are shifted to schools (  without the moon (  in the day-time ) ,\nwithout family members and without the mood .\n\n\nTeachers or child-care workers teaching children to make lanterns\nare  the routine annual duties in the Mid-Autumn Festival.\n 16 \n\n\nBut the nice shots of family activities - gathering and sharing -\nseldom appear in the  home  . \n\n \n\nFurthermore , the change of the number , position , character ,\nrole and importance of family members causes a transformation in the\nlantern-culture .\n\n\nSince the 1960s , the government has educated people to have family\nplanning to minimize the number of children.  17 \n\n\nSmaller number of children in a family raises the importance of\nchildren .\n\n\nThe popularity of a nuclear family also enhances the significant and\nimportance status if children in a family . \n\n \n\nIn 1994 , 1996 and 1997 , interviews were conducted in a\ntraditional Chinese funeral paper-offering shop (  selling items for sacred\npurposes ) before the Mid-Autumn Festivals .\n\n\nSince the first interviews , Ah-Ying  18  remarked that the\nnumber of children in a family affected her business .\n\n\nShe mentioned that in the old days , one family might only have one\nlantern for several children and they enjoyed their lantern activities in the\noutdoor .\n\n\nMost of the tomes , children made lanterns by themselves (  or with\ntheir parents ) .\n\n\nNowadays , while the living standard is rising , there might be more\nthan three lanterns for one child in a family , but the child might play or\nhang up lanterns in the indoor environment only .\n\n\nAs stated before , children seldom go out to play with neighbors - -\n strangers  .\n\n\nParents always remind their children that they need to aware of the\nstrangers or misbehaviors of other children .\n\n\nThis phenomenon may reflect the importance of children nowadays or\nthe social relationship of our modern world .\n\n\nAs Harvey stated , people are self-protected and separated with \nviolence  - the physical setting or the value judgment - - without\ncommunication (  Harvey ) .\n\n\nWhile compared with the happy atmosphere of the harvest in the old\ndays , the meaning of the Mid-Autumn Festival (  Harvest Day ) - - celebration\n, sharing and gathering - - is now totally distorted . \n\n\n\n\nAs importance of children is increasing , materials involved in the\nlantern activites also start to have differences . Besides \" boiling\nwax\"*** and playing lanterns with candles in parks by some children ,\nelectric bulbs and chemical lighting materials (  e.g. , florescent lighting\nsticks ) are candle substitutes . As Ah-Ying mentioned , some lanterns only\nhas small bells inside it but without any lighting items . She wondered how\nthose plastic inflatable lanterns could create fun in the outdoor at night.\nLacking elderly in a nuclear family also accelerated the changes and the\nformation of new layers of temporal dimension of culture (  Ho ) . Ah-Ying\npointed out that seldom young people liked to buy sacred materials (  papers\nand paper models for the ancestor worship and offering ) from traditional\nfuneral paper-offering stores . Only fishermen , people living in walled city\n( wei-tsuen ) and elder people buy paper lanterns or ask for them as gifts for\ntheir children Young parents prefer to go to department stores or modern\nshops to buy lanterns . Most of these lanterns are metal wire-famed ,\ninflatable and made of plastic instead of papers and mit. Lacking an\ninheritance of skills is another factor making lanterns change , Ah-Ying\nstated that there were not so many traditional shops producing traditional\nlanterns locally . The number of \" masters &rdquo; knowing how to make\ntraditional lanterns was becoming a countable number . Some of these masters\nwere too old to work and some changed their careers for getting better lives .\nActually , these masters tried to make paper lanterns with modern images and\nshapes such as airplanes or tanks in the 1960s . However , that kind of\nimprovement and modification could not provide chances for them to survive .\nNowadays , most of the lanterns are produced in mainland China . For getting\nthe greatest effect with the lowest cost , using plastic materials with\nminimum manual operations is the essential and effective strategy . Although\nlearning to make a tradi-tional lantern for the Mid-Autumn Festival is not a\nvery hard job (  beside some large paper lanterns for exhibition ) , it os a\ntime consuming and \" hopeless &rdquo; job for young people in Hong Kong .\nAh-Ying pointed out that her children did not want to learn her skills and\nshe also did not want them to inherit her business , too. Through\nimprovements in science and education , the significance of legends and\nstories about the moon have diminished . Science and tech-nology also provide\nmore and wider communication channels so that dif-ferent concepts with\nimpacts of different cultures cause Hong Kong &lsquo; s local culture and\nbeliefs to change . From the religious and hierarchical changed to be more\nartistic and customary . As stated in the promotion booklet of Lantern\nCarnival 1976 (  Urban Council , \" Lantern\" ) , public lantern activities\nare used for improving the custom activities and tourism industry *** . While\nmore and morelantern festivals conducted in Hong Kong such as Zigong Chinese\nLantern Festival for the \" 1994 Regional Council Festival , &rdquo;\nartistic and customary concepts of lantern activities in the Mid-Autumn\nFestival are deeply impressed in Hong Kong people &lsquo; s minds . It also\ncreates an idea that lanterns are related to entertainment and carnivals only\n, but not the concepts of nature-admiring or family-union. A Real\nUnderstanding and Practice? Lanterns of Mid-Autumn Festival have developed\nthrough about fif-teen hundred years of history . All of the changes in\nlanterns , same as the Hong Kong cultures , are not caused by an individual\nand isolated social factor or changed . They are caused by living standard ,\nliving environ-ment , family nature , and social change together . Although\nit is very diffi-cult , or may not be a correct way to stop the changing of\nlantern-culture as well as stopping the progression and the development of\nour society , care should be taken as to what should be maintained or paid\nmore atten-tion to in cultural changes (  outer and intermediate levels of the\nspatial dimension of culture ) it may not be the core part we should pay more\nattention to , the area which should be considered is the rationale and\nbelief behind a change , and the effect of it (  inner level of spatial\ndimension ) (  Ho ) . As torn-jeans and bar-code-tattoos may not only ve a\nquestion of likes and dislikes , they may be the reflection of the feeling\nand thinking if our teenages . In the same way , the change of the inner\nlevel of spatial dimension of lantern-culture , as well as our cultures ,\nare the areas we should pay more attention to nowadays. Today , parents in\nHong Kong may buy several lanterns for each of their children in the\nMid-Autumn Festival nowasays . However , it does not imply that all parents\nconsider it to be the core objectives of the festivals . When looking at this\nroutine behavior from the semiotic point of view - - the \" significant\n&rdquo; of lanterns in the Mid-Autumn Festival , it is not difficult to\nobserve that parents seem to project their behaviors of buying lanterns as\nfulfilling or getting all of the objectives froom the festival (  see Table\n4a). Ah-Ying said that some people went to her paper shop to buy tradi-tional\nlanterns every year . They were fishermen , old housewives and some who were\nliving in the Peak-Level - - a high living standard resi-dential area Hong\nKong . However , it does not imply all of these people understand and respect\nthe traditional core meanings of the Mid-Autumn Festival , though they follow\nexactly what people did in the past . Actually , some of them may understand\nand really want to achieve the goals of the festival , but many of these\npeople may not. Chamberlain points out the major reason for people\nre-enacting tra-ditional sacred activities or events is a psychological\nfulfillment (  Chamberlain ) . Most of them only perform/practice the visible\npart of an activity (  outer and intermediate levels of the spatial dimension)\nbut neglect the core function and meaning of it . It is same as man &lsquo; s\ndeifica-tions of Kuan-Ti.*** People re-enacting a traditional or sacred\nactivity insis-tently without getting the spirit of it , is the same as the\npractice of the triads and the police praying to same patron. When looking at\nthe police who insist on buying traditional lanterns through the semiotic\npoint of view , some of them may project their behaviors as being cultivated\nChinese by only fulfilling a small part of  objectives of\nthe festival (  see Table 4b ) . In fact , this kind of behavior does not only\nappear in the Mid-Autumn Festival . Every Mother &lsquo; s Day , carnations\nare well sold and Chinese restaurants are full of people for drinking tea\nwith mothers . It is really a question whether it is a good son/daughter\nwhile he/she only has tea with mother on that special day only . Moreover ,\nin order to get seats on Mother &lsquo; s Day , people need to queue outside\nrestaurants and most of them are \" fathers &rdquo; and \" mothers\n, &rdquo; while children are still asleep at home. Design of lanterns is also\nprogressing in a similar manner . Businessmen realize that shapes and the\nmaterials for lanterns are not so critical as the existence of them . No\nmatter it is a sailor-moon image or just simply as a florescent stick , the\ncrucial point for a success in their business is an object which can be\ncalled \" lantern &rdquo; and people can imag-ine themselves fulfilling\nand getting the meaning of the festival through owning or buying this kind of\nlanterns - - the sign of the festival. On the other hand , for suiting and\nenriching everyday life , a lantern carnival in a district level was\nintroduced into Hong Kong in 1974 (  Tsim Sha Tsui Kaifong Welfare\nAssociation ) . In order to invite more people to be involved in these social\nactivities , designers and promoters introduce and organize more , larger\ncarnivals in each year. As the culture of Hong Kong (  same as China-towns\ncoun-tries and urban areas in main-land China ) has been partially inherited\nfrom China , and partially influenced by other cultures , people need to face\na very embarrassing situation that they want to maintain the tradi-tional\nculture of Chinese but also want to march with foreign steps . In order to\nconfront this complicated and puzzling circumstances and to get a balance ,\npeople retain some selected substances , and tolerate and dis-card some which\nare difficult to match with people &lsquo; s daily life . Every children to\nhave family unions in the Mid-Autumn Festal , Although the date for a supper\nmay have some adjustment or compromise. Generally , we cannot comment that\nthese product designs or activity arrangements are kitsch and useless for our\nsociety . Howeverm as Hoshino(47 ) states that the \" connotation &rdquo;\nof an item or an event in our society is the most valuable and meaningful\nfactor for us to concern . So , we should be careful that these depthnessless\n\" nine day &lsquo; s wonder &rdquo; the original design or meaningless\nroutine activities may block our sensitivity , that we only concern ourselves\nwith the materials or the superficial fulfill-ment , but forget the original\nconcepts and meanings. Therefore , the lantern should be used as a bridge to\nhelp Hong Kong people to get to the original objectives , but only the\nsuperficial meanings of the Mid-Autumn Festival . On the one hand , materials\nand images (  the outer and the intermediate levels of the spatial dimension\nof the lantern-culture ) should reflect the Chinese characteristics . On the\nother hand , we cannot omit the existence of social changes , So , the\ncon-tents of lanterns and activities should be matched with the lives of Hong\nKong people . This matching implies not only aiming at , market require-ment\n, but also trying to remind people about the original objectives of the\nfestival. Actually , sailor-moon lanterns may be a good representation for us\nto understand the culture identity in Hong Kong design , It mirrors market\norientated behavior and short-sighted market investment . It may also\nreflect innovative mind of Hong Kong designers that they can substitute a\nmeaningless item or image into a product . However , what actions should be\ndone after the understanding ? Hong Kong is not an agricultural society\nanymore , her culture is being developed under multiple-inheritance . All of\nthe subcultures are collaged together . It is extremely difficult for us to\narrive at a concrete and positive outcome and nobody has the right or power\nto say which direction of design in Hong Kong is the best one for our\nsociety/culture . Arguable , however , religious and hierarchical directions\nof the Mid-Autumn Festival may seem to be the incorrect way . Thus ,\nincreasing the possibility for family union , appreciating nature and the\nfolk art must be clear goals of the fes-tival. To conclude , we should keep\nin mind while designing or buying a lantern: to stimulate more creation but\nnit only purchasing; to encourage group activity but not only individual\nplaying; and to support family sharing but not only social entertainment .\nObviously , these concepts may not only be associated with lanterns . They\nmay also be workable and beneficial for designing many of the objects and\nactivities for our modern world .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d5a32a85-9f12-4c4f-86e0-525bee5ec3c5", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.955003+00:00"}

Mr Schoneburg\nsaid . \n\n \n\nThe computer techniques are called cellular automata , one of the\nhottest research areas that combine computer science and branches of\nmathematics called chaos and complexity theories . \n\n \n\nBy simulating realistic traffic , population and weather\nconditions , as well as the disease  ' s medical characteristics using the new\ntechniques , policy-makers could work with various likely scenarios of how\nan outbreak would spread and how the spread might be halted , such as by\nerecting barriers and disrupting air travel patterns and imposing health\nmeasures at critical centres or cities . \n\n \n\nThese inter-disciplinary theories are widely discussed and taught\nin major universities around the world , including those in Hong Kong , but\ntheir applications in epidemic studies are uncommon , Mr Schoneburg said .\n\n\n \n\n\" I believe the US military is probably the only one that\nwidely uses these simulations .\n\n\nIt  ' s all classified and it  ' s very difficult for outsiders to get\ncontracts (  with the United States ' military ) , &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\nThe mathematician and computer scientist had worked in Germany\nand the US before setting up his business in Hong Kong . \n\n \n\nHe explained how computer-simulated epidemics worked .\n\n\n\" Neighbourhoods are not simply defined by physical distance ,\nbut by their connectivity through traffic , &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\n\" If an infectious disease spreads from one place , many\nother places that might be quite distant will report the outbreak of the same\ndisease after a period of time .\n\n\nThe simulation of spreading diseases helps to identify which places\nare the most critical ones and what changes in (  air , sea and land ) traffic\nhave what effects on the spread of the disease . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nMr Schoneburg said Hong Kong and mainland authorities may\nconsider the new techniques in future outbreaks , but he added his company\nhad not approached any official agency . \n\n \n\nUnlike traditional programming , the techniques specify a few\nsimple rules at the outset , so that the key computing components , or\ncellular automata , can evolve , as if on their own , patterns and behaviour\nthat resemble real-life phenomena such as cell development , population\ngrowth , biological evolution and a disease  ' s outbreak . \n\n \n\nThis is based on a fundamental principle in chaos and complexity\ntheories: tiny disturbances and variations , virtually impossible to take\ninto account at the outset , can lead to unpredictable outcomes.\n\n\nThis chaos principle is used to contrast with classical dynamics\nwhich say that if all the initial conditions are specified , all future\nstates can be precisely predicted . \n\n \n\n alex.lo@scmp.com  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n W3C sees future of Web lying in character building \n \n\n\n TONY FUNG  \n\n \n\nThe World Wide Web Consortium (  W3C ) , an international body\nwhich creates Web standards , has a mission to lead the Web to its full\npotential as a forum for information , commerce , inspiration , independent\nthought and collective understanding . \n\n \n\nIt does so by developing technologies , specifications ,\nguidelines , software and tools for the Web . Internet users often overlook\nfunctions , other than enabling Web browsing , performed by the W3C . \n\n \n\nMany people view the Web as a medium accessible by computers only .\n\n\nThe W3C defines

{"text": "Homing in on housing  \n\n \n\nProviding affordable housing for the general population is an\nissue that has dogged Hong Kong for as long as anyone can remember .\n\n\nThe plethora of bodies carrying the housing tag testifies to past\nefforts to tackle the problem from different angles . \n\n \n\nFirst , there is the Housing Authority .\n\n\nIt is tasked with building and managing public housing , both for sale\nand rent , for low-income earners .\n\n\nResponsible to the Government , it is run by a board of more than two\ndozen members from different walks of life .\n\n\nIts executive arm , the Housing Department , is a monolithic\nbureaucracy of 12,000 . \n\n \n\nThe Housing Society is a much smaller organisation .\n\n\nNominally a non-governmental body , it actually takes the cue from\nthe Government to provide affordable housing for the so-called sandwich class .\n\n\n \n\nBesides , the Mass Transit Railway Corporation and Kowloon-Canton\nRailway Corporation , which are partially and wholly owned by the Government\nrespectively , both have private housing development rights over their\nstations . \n\n \n\nDirectly or indirectly , these bodies are answerable to the\nHousing Bureau , which was set up in the mid-1990s in response to public\ndemands to bring skyrocketing housing prices down , but has since gained\nnotoriety for its failure to engineer a soft landing for the housing market .\n\n\n \n\nWith so many housing bodies , each with their own self interests\n, no wonder the Chief Secretary , rather than the Housing Secretary , has to\nbe the Government  ' s most authoritative spokesman on housing . \n\n \n\nEven without the forthcoming introduction of a ministerial system\nand the related re-arrangement of the policy bureaus , the duplicating roles\nof the existing housing organs need to be streamlined .\n\n\nHowever , what really should have happened first is a review of Hong\nKong  ' s housing policy . \n\n \n\nThe housing bodies were set up to achieve specific missions under\nthe existing housing policy , in which public housing featured prominently .\n\n\n \n\nBut times have changed and public housing has clearly out-lived\nits purpose .\n\n\nThe current structural revamp , whose details are still under wraps ,\nshould not preclude an overhaul of the way in which the community  ' s housing\naspirations are met . \n\n \n\nAny strategic change must involve trimming the Government  ' s\ndirect involvement in building and managing public housing .\n\n\nIf that should mean disbanding the Housing Authority and Housing\nSociety , so be it . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Diplomatic decency  \n\n \n\nIn the post-September 11 climate of fear and insecurity , Europe\nis blazing a path of rapprochement with alleged rogue states that the United\nStates would do well to emulate . \n\n \n\nRather than use the Bush administration  ' s worn-out repertoire of\nthreats and warnings , the European Union is treating Iran with respect .\n\n\nThere is talk of trade and diplomatic relations instead of veiled\nreferences to an Afghanistan-style bombing apocalypse . \n\n \n\nThe process was kick-started yesterday by EU Commissioner for\nExternal Affairs Chris Patten who held talks in Brussels with Iran  ' s Deputy\nForeign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif .\n\n\nAhead lies the chance of ties , which Mr Patten believes is the best\nway to foster political change in Iran . \n\n \n\nIt is not an approach favoured by the United States and its close\nally in the Middle East , Israel .

Bush in January\nnamed Iran , Iraq and North Korea as an \" axis of evil nations &rdquo;\ndeveloping nuclear and chemical weapons . \n\n \n\nIran and Iraq support the idea of a Palestinian state and Israel\naccuses Teheran of supplying weapons to anti-Israeli militants .\n\n\nBoth also represent \" unfinished business &rdquo; for\nWashington - the inherent desire to win back lost pride for the toppling of\nthe US-backed Shah of Iran during the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the failure\nin the 1991 Gulf War to unseat President Saddam Hussein . \n\n \n\nFew nations support the US approach , which at the weekend\nextended to Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld suggesting American operatives\nworking within Iraq to arrest or even kill Saddam .\n\n\nCanada on Monday said the United Nations was the appropriate forum to\ndecide on action against Iraq , while Mr Bush last month met opposition from\nEuropean leaders during a four-nation visit . \n\n \n\nWashington  ' s words of war may aim to engender American\npatriotism , but for the rest of the world they instil insecurity . \n\n \n\nA more intelligent approach is the European example - treating\nnations with respect and as equals , no matter what their political stripes .\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Flaws in the mix  \n\n \n\nIn Hong Kong , as in most societies , people are often judged by\nwhere they live .\n\n\nAlthough the stigma of living in public housing is not strong here\nbecause half of the local population reside in subsidised homes , owning an\nupmarket flat in a nice neighbourhood is still most people  ' s cherished dream .\n\n\n \n\nPlanners always try to ensure some areas are \" reserved\n&rdquo; for the rich by manipulating plot ratios and the siting of public\namenities so only plush big flats will be built there and only the well-off\ncan afford them . \n\n \n\nThe most they would do to prevent class differences from being\nmanifested too acutely is to site mass private housing estates next to public\nhousing estates in the new towns .\n\n\nBut they would not dream of selling flats inside a private housing\nestate at differential rates to buyers based on their varying income levels .\n\n\n \n\nWhat is wrong with the mixed development policy is that it will\ndo just that .\n\n\nWhen the North Point Estate site is put on sale , the developer who\nbuys it will be required to hand over a specified proportion of flats within\nthe development for sale under the Home Ownership Scheme . \n\n \n\nAfter vociferous protests from developers , the only concession\nthe Housing Authority has made is that the flats ear-marked for subsidised\nsale will be in designated blocks .\n\n\nThis is contrary to the original policy , as stated in the Long Term\nHousing Strategy published in 1998 , that \" the flats will be selected\nat random throughout the development\" . \n\n \n\nIn a submission to the Government in 1997 , the authority saw\nmixed development as a means \" to remove the possible social labelling\nwhich public housing projects carry , and therefore help to foster social\nharmony\" . \n\n \n\nBut has housing ever caused social disharmony in Hong Kong ?\n\n\nNot really .\n\n\nPoor relations between residents of public and private housing have\nnever been an issue . Rather , homeowners ' simmering discontent over the\nfalling values of their properties is threatening to explode . \n\n \n\nThe deeper question about mixed development is whether we want to\nfoster housing dependency and to change deep-rooted values of regarding one  ' s\nhome as a reflection of one  ' s station in life . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  A logical approach  \n\n \n\nThere is no guarantee that the Israeli decision to move into\nPalestinian towns will end Palestinian suicide bomb attacks .\n\n\nWhat is more guaranteed is that the presence of the Israeli military\nwill further infuriate the Palestinians . \n\n \n\nMilitary force , the rounding up of suspected militants , and the\nhumiliation of the Palestinian leadership has been tried before , but the\nsuicide attacks still keep coming . \n\n \n\nAfter Tuesday  ' s suicide bomb attack which killed 19 Israelis in\nJerusalem , Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon had to respond in some way .\n\n\nHe has responded in a way that most Israelis would like him to .\n\n\nBut the recent occupation of Palestinian towns under Operation\nDefensive Shield , does not appear to have enhanced Israel  ' s security , as\nthe recent attack has shown .\n\n\nThe conflict of the past few decades has produced a generation of\nPalestinians who are willing to kill themselves for their cause .\n\n\nThe experience of the past shows that fresh military action will only\nstrengthen their resolve . \n\n \n\nUnfortunately , while past experience has taught us what is not\nlikely to work , no one is quite sure what the best approach is to restore\npeace between Israelis and Palestinians .\n\n\nThe international community is clear about what it would like to see:\nan Israeli state and a Palestinian state side by side , both with secure ,\nrecognised boundaries .\n\n\nThe problem is that every effort so far to reach this goal has fallen\nby the wayside .\n\n\nApportioning blame to one side or the other for this state of affairs\ndoes not help .\n\n\nIf anything , the leadership of both the Israelis and the\nPalestinians have been culpable for this situation . \n\n \n\nSecurity for Israel , and dignity for the Palestinians .\n\n\nHow is this to be achieved ?\n\n\nEven if no one is quite clear about how to proceed , it is obvious\nthat as a first step the violence must end , and talks must begin .\n\n\nThe United States has a crucial role to play in getting talks resumed .\n\n\nThe speech that US President George W . Bush is to deliver outlining\nhis plans to restore peace will be an important step in this direction .\n\n\nIt is hoped that extreme elements on both the Israeli and the\nPalestinian side will restrain themselves enough to give peace a chance .\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Housing challenge  \n\n \n\nThe long-awaited shake-up of the Government  ' s housing machinery\nbrings much needed simplicity to what was a confusing and unwieldy collection\nof different bodies with often overlapping mandates . \n\n \n\nThe most eye-catching changes are the merger of the Housing\nBureau and the Housing Department into a single organisation and the gradual\nchange in the role of the Housing Authority from an executive to an advisory\nbody .\n\n\nEqually significant for the property market has been the decision to\ntighten the granting of land to the MTRC , the KCRC and the Urban Renewal\nAuthority .\n\n\nThe Housing Society , too , will see a change in its role from a\nbuilder of public rental or subsidised home ownership flats to an agent for\nurban renewal in partnership with the Urban Renewal Authority . \n\n \n\nThese changes make administrative sense , creating clear lines of\ncommand as well as clarifying the roles that the different organisations\ndealing with housing will play .\n\n\nThey will centralise power , but this is essential if we are to get\nmore coherent policy . \n\n \n\nBut the real test of how effective these changes will be is the\nextent to which they help to achieve the aims of assuring quality housing in\na way that is cost effective . The Government  ' s declared strategy is to rely\non the private sector to the maximum extent possible , and using public\nresources only for those who genuinely cannot afford housing at market rates .\n\n\n \n\nSticking to this will require political courage .\n\n\nWhen housing prices start to rise again , as they almost inevitably\nwill , there will be an increasing clamour for the Government to actively\nre-enter the housing market to provide low-cost housing .\n\n\nPast experience has shown that this a slippery slope that will lead\nto ever increasing involvement in the housing market .\n\n\nMr Tung  ' s new administration will need to show resolve to avoid the\ntemptation to re-enter a sector that it is only slowly extricating itself\nfrom . \n\n \n\nAt the same time , the Government needs to focus attention on its\nlong-term land supply policy to avoid the boom and bust cycle that Hong Kong\nis still recovering from .\n\n\nAn efficient and transparent land supply policy has to be part and\nparcel of a programme to deliver cost efficient public housing in a way that\ncomplements the market , rather than manipulating or controlling it . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n A future in the past  \n\n \n\nThe developed world needs to look at the lessons of history when\nit is helping developing countries .\n\n\nToo often , the answers to conflicts lie in the not-so-distant past\n, yet are ignored in favour of more fashionable ideas of resolution . \n\n \n\nThe United States ' war on terrorism has been cited once more as\na solution , this time to resolve the rebel insurgency in South Asia  ' s\npoorest nation , Nepal . \n\n \n\nThe Maoist extremists aim to overthrow the Government and\nredistribute wealth and land .\n\n\nAt least 4,700 people have died during the six-year conflict , 2,500\nof them since November , when peace talks collapsed , a state of emergency\nwas declared and the army mobilised . \n\n \n\nAt a conference in London this week , Britain pledged a 10-fold\nincrease in military support and provision of two helicopters for the\npoorly-equipped army .\n\n\nIn May , the US offered US&dollar;20 million (  HK&dollar;156\nmillion )  in defence equipment .\n\n\nBut the Himalayan kingdom  ' s problems are deeper-rooted .\n\n\nCorruption and economic mismanagement have impoverished a nation\nonce seen as a potential second Singapore .\n\n\nGovernment instability - nine prime ministers since democracy was\nrestored in 1990 - has made continuity of policies impossible . \n\n \n\nNepalis earn an average of 60 US cents a day , almost half of\nwhat the World Bank considers the poverty line .\n\n\nMany people , unable to find jobs , have left for contract work\nelsewhere . \n\n \n\nThe Government has portrayed the insurgency as part of the war\nagainst terrorism , but it is a conflict that goes beyond resolution through\nmilitary action . \n\n \n\nA more effective solution can be found in the US-backed plans\nwhich rebuilt Japan and Europe after World War II .\n\n\nUsing development aid rather than military muscle , the wrongs which\nhave been created can be eradicated . \n\n \n\nIt will be an expensive and lengthy process , but it is the only\nway developed nations can give Nepal a better future .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "cf327b51-e72b-4f28-afef-140042c2bdcb", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.958430+00:00"}

Mail and Hotmail so getting them to pay for\nwireless access might be difficult , &rdquo; she said . \n\n \n\n\" Currently , those services that are making money are\nstill those rudimentary services like logo and ring-tone downloads .\n\n\nI think location-based services (  LBS ) , which capitalise on\npersonalisation , will be an important driver . \n\n \n\n\" However , LBS is still not widely used at the moment .\n\n\nAs to what will be the hottest among consumers is difficult to say\nbecause consumers span the entire spectrum from young to working adults to\nsocialites etc , each with their own lifestyle patterns and each demanding a\nseparate set of functionalities from the wireless Web . &rdquo; \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Fibre-optics on growth curve   \n\n\n Rapid increase in use of next-generation broadband forecast\nas SAR providers enter market   \n\n\n INTERNET   \n\n\n Sidney Luk  \n\n \n\nThe number of fibre-optic broadband subscribers in Hong Kong is\nset to grow from 25,250 last year to about 700,000 by 2006 , with market\nrevenue rising from US&dollar;116.82 million to US&dollar;3.48 billion ,\naccording to International Data Corp . \n\n \n\nMetro Ethernet broadband services , based on fibre-optic networks\n, provide a maximum bandwidth of one gigabit per second , while traditional\nADSL (  asymmetric digital subscriber line ) and cable modem broadband services\noffer a bandwidth of three megabits per second to six Mbps . \n\n \n\n\" With highly scalable bandwidth potential , metro Ethernet\nservices are considered by many to be the broadband ideal , &rdquo; said\nRenee Gamble , IDC  ' s market analyst for communications research . \n\n \n\nThe technology runs on a metropolitan area network and is\nmarketed as an alternative to leased line services . \n\n \n\nIn Hong Kong , Hutchison Global Crossing and New World Telephone\nhave already launched premium bandwidth services and a range of lower\nbandwidth alternatives which better suit small and medium-sized enterprises\nand the residential market . \n\n \n\nTheir growth has subsequently persuaded Pacific Century\nCyberWorks to offer a similar range of services . \n\n \n\nMs Gamble said CyberWorks would be ready to launch its services\nlater this year . \n\n \n\nShe said Hong Kong was well networked by fibre , which made the\nservice commercially viable .\n\n\n\" Its high-density housing and commercial building developments\nmake provisioning of fibre-optic connections highly scalable , &rdquo; she\nsaid . \n\n \n\nThe decision by three of Hong Kong  ' s four fixed-line providers\nto enter the market owed much to Government policies that encouraged\ncompetition , she said . \n\n \n\n\" For two such providers , metro Ethernet services are\ntheir broadband service focus and they are working hard to gain market share\n, &rdquo; Ms Gamble said . \n\n \n\nIDC forecasts that the number of metro Ethernet subscribers in\nthe Asia-Pacific region , excluding Japan , will increase from just 280,000\nlast year to 9.29 million in 2006 , with a compound annual growth rate of 110\nper cent .\n\n\nThe market , worth US&dollar;395.34 million last year , was expected\nto reach about US&dollar;1.5 billion this year and US&dollar;19.44 billion in\n2006 . \n\n \n\nIDC predicts revenue from the China market will grow from\nUS&dollar;39.09 million to US&dollar;1.1 billion over that time , with\nsubscriber numbers increasing from 132,000 to 3.85 million . \n\n \n\n\" China currently dominates the region in terms of\nsubscribers and will continue to do so throughout our forecast period ,\n&rdquo; Ms Gamble said . \n\n \n\n\" All the major service providers in China are vying for\nthe metro Ethernet market . \n\n \n\n\" Because of the tremendous level of infrastructure\ndevelopment ongoing across China , the laying of fibre is more economical\nthan in other more developed areas - service providers are not needing to dig\nup roads to lay fibre , but are working with developers to install fibre at\nthe same time . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nMs Gamble estimated that at China  ' s current rate of expansion ,\nat least 150 cities would have optical-fibre network access by the end of\nlast year or early this year , which would compete against ADSL and cable\nmodem technologies . \n\n \n\nNetworking equipment company Unisphere Networks said many cities\nin China were deploying metro Ethernet networks . \n\n \n\nAndrew Coward , the company  ' s Asia-Pacific vice-president of\nengineering , said the system would become common in Hong Kong over the next\nfour years as it was high-speed and easy to use . \n\n \n\n\" Every PC has Ethernet built in , &rdquo; Mr Coward said .\n\n\n\" Everybody knows how to plug in an Ethernet cable .\n\n\nA lot of people know how to turn on the Ethernet connection in their\nPCs . \n\n \n\n\" All of these factors mean that it is easier to get people\nto use Ethernet , rather than ATM (  asynchronous transfer mode ) , frame relay\n, ISDN (  integrated services digital network ) or some other solutions that\npeople have some fear about . \n\n \n\n\" When a service provider gives you a socket in the wall\nwhich is the network , then allows you to configure it yourself through a Web\nbrowser , it is going to have a very high acceptance , particularly among\nsmall-business people , &rdquo; he said . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Citrix to run business drive in Asia from HK   \n\n\n EXPANSION   \n\n\n Sidney Luk  \n\n \n\nApplication server software maker Citrix Systems has relocated\nits regional headquarters to Hong Kong from Sydney as part of its Asian\nexpansion plans . \n\n \n\nThe Hong Kong office will oversee operations in China , Taiwan ,\nHong Kong , South Korea , India , Singapore , the Philippines , Malaysia ,\nIndonesia , Thailand and Vietnam . \n\n \n\nWith a strong customer base already in Hong Kong , Dennis Rose ,\nvice-president for Asia at Citrix , said it was an easy decision to choose\nHong Kong as a regional headquarters .\n\n\nThe company saw Hong Kong as a future gateway to the potentially huge\nChina market . \n\n \n\nCitrix is a Nasdaq-listed thin-client software vendor , which\nallows companies to run their allocations from a server , rather than the\ntraditional fat-client computing or mainframe model that requires computer\ndevices with high processing power . \n\n \n\n\" We allow end-users to take applications - it can be\nWindows applications , Java , Unix - into one phrase rather than hundreds of\npersonal computers , &rdquo; said Mr Rose . \n\n \n\nHe said the company  ' s core application serving technology ,\nIndependent Computing Architecture (  ICA ) , also ran on wireless devices and\n\" delivered server-based computing of any application on any devices on\nany network\" . \n\n \n\nMr Rose said ICA did not require much disc memory .\n\n\n\" It can basically run on Pentium III or Pentium 4 servers .\n\n\nIt enables people to have access to their applications over very\nsmall bandwidth like 10 to 20 kilobytes per second , which is typical in the\nGSM connectivity space . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nMr Rose said there had been at least nine million ICA licences\ninstalled and shared by 35 million users since the system was introduced in\n1995 . \n\n \n\nCitrix also has offices in Singapore and India .\n\n\nIt is due to open offices in Kuala Lumpur and Seoul in April . \n\n \n\nThe company reported revenue grew from US&dollar;470.4 million in\n2000 to US&dollar;591.6 million last year .\n\n\nIts Asia-Pacific operations , including Japan , Australia and New\nZealand , saw annual revenue growth of 60 per cent . \n\n \n\nThe Korean market is particularly strong .\n\n\nA report by International Data Corp said the Korean market for system\ninfrastructure software was forecast to grow from US&dollar;177.4 million in\n1999 to US&dollar;411.5 million in 2004 . \n\n \n\nAsian clients include Pohang Iron and Steel , the world  ' s\nbiggest steel producer , and wireless devices developer Cyberbank , which\nplans to start shipping a palmtop device - PC-Ephone - this quarter which\nruns on Citrix  ' s application serving software MetaFrame . \n\n \n\nMr Rose said: \" The E-phone of Cyberbank is a very good\nexample of Citrix  ' s licensing applications .\n\n\nUsers can have their phones as devices to connect to servers running\non Windows , Java or Unix applications . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nIn Hong Kong , Citrix helped Midland Realty implement a server-\nbased computing system after its merger with Hong Kong Property Service\nHoldings .\n\n\nThe new system centralised all data among branch offices and reduced\nthe bandwidth requirement .\n\n\nThe leased line costs were decreased from HK&dollar;15 million in\n1999 to HK&dollar;5 million this year . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Windows losing ground to open-source rivals in China \n \n\n\n In a bid to stem Linux  ' s popularity , Microsoft has allowed\nthe mainland controlled access to its codes   \n\n\n Sidney Luk  \n\n \n\nJust days after Bill Gates ' high-profile visit to Beijing last\nweek to promote Microsoft  ' s Windows , a survey shows the United States\nsoftware giant  ' s flagship product is losing ground to open-source operating\nsystems such as Linux . \n\n \n\nThe International Data Corp (  IDC ) survey found that 95 per cent\nof mainland enterprises had Windows running on their desktops and laptops\nwhile 4 per cent were using Linux . \n\n \n\nMeanwhile , 63 per cent of servers were operating on Windows and\n3 per cent on Linux . \n\n \n\nBut Linux usage in a client operating environment would grow 39\nper cent year on year , compared with 11 per cent for Windows , the survey\nfound .\n\n\nLinux server usage would increase by 41 per cent and Windows by just\n8 per cent . \n\n \n\nWhile Windows was not expected to lose its grip in the next few\nyears , IDC research manager for software Andrew Chew said: \" Microsoft\nis not going to take this Linux development lightly . \n\n \n\n\" There may yet be a shift in Microsoft  ' s pricing and\nproduct positioning to keep Linux at bay . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nMicrosoft chairman Mr Gates was in Beijing last week to sign a\nGovernment Security Programme agreement , allowing China controlled access to\nthe Windows source code and other technical data . \n\n \n\nMarket watchers saw this as a move by Microsoft to stem the\npopularity of open-source and cheaper software such as Linux . \n\n \n\nThe Ministry of Information Industry set up an open-source\nalliance last year , showing its support for Linux-based systems .\n\n\nGovernment departments in Beijing and Guangdong have awarded\ncontracts to Linux vendors in the past year , including Red Flag , Thiz and\nKingsoft . \n\n \n\n\" It is unlikely that the Microsoft agreement will make a\ndifference in the Chinese government  ' s support for Linux , &rdquo; Mr Chew\nsaid . \n\n \n\n\" The agreement will only superficially help solve some of\nthe security concerns that the government has . \n\n \n\n\" Other concerns that are likely to remain are the question\nof total transparency and the high cost of time and manpower needed to fully\nunderstand the codes . &rdquo; \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Hongkong.com diversifies in search for viability  \n\n\n\n SIDNEY LUK  \n\n \n\nIn a quest for long-term viability after the bursting of the\nInternet bubble , hongkong.com has been moving away from the provision of\ncontent and mail services and switched focus to the mainland  ' s wireless\npopulation . \n\n \n\nEarlier this week , the Growth Enterprise Market-listed\nsubsidiary of Chinadotcom completed the purchase of mainland short messaging\nservice (  SMS ) developer Newpalm (  China ) Information Technology , after\nreviewing more than 50 acquisition opportunities last year . \n\n \n\nThe company said the Newpalm move was its first expansion into\nChina .\n\n\nUnlike other mobile service providers , Newpalm is more focused on\ncommunity services such as mobile chatting and dating rather than ringtone\nand content downloads . \n\n \n\n\" The margins of those downloads are not particularly high\n, which is why we haven't pushed those items , &rdquo; said hongkong.com\nchief executive Rudy Chan Kai-yu . \n\n \n\nMr Chan said Newpalm would bring in more than HK&dollar;20\nmillion in revenue this quarter and contribute more than 50 per cent of\nrevenue for the whole year . \n\n \n\nThe market was encouraged by the announcement .\n\n\nThe counter was heavily traded , with 36.9 million shares changing\nhands , and closed up 46 per cent on the week at 38 HK cents . \n\n \n\nWhile some brokers expressed doubts that the price paid , no\nmore than US&dollar;55 million , was a bit expensive for a mainland software\nmaker , Mr Chan said that it was reasonable , based on a 10-times\nprice-to-earnings ratio , and hongkong.com did not mind paying up if Newpalm\ncould generate more revenue . \n\n \n\nMr Chan said he was very confident that community chat rooms ,\nwhere people develop friendships , was a better business than ringtone and\nnews downloads , because no content was needed . \n\n \n\nSubscribers are charged five yuan (  about HK&dollar;4.71 ) a\nmonth to join the communities and they need to pay for every SMS they send as\nthey communicate with their new friends . \n\n \n\nIt is a lucrative business on the mainland .\n\n\nChina Mobile takes 15 per cent of SMS revenue raised and China\nUnicom takes 12 per cent while Newpalm holds the rest . \n\n \n\nThe number of mobile users in China grew to 216.39 million in\nFebruary from 155.85 million a year ago , according to the Ministry of\nInformation Industry .\n\n\nA Pyramid Research report estimated that SMS revenues hit about\nUS&dollar;750 million last year and predicted they would reach US&dollar;16\nbillion by 2007 . \n\n \n\n\" It makes sense that some of the portals - if they don't\nhave a strong SMS or online gaming base - purchase some of the smaller\nup-and-coming companies , &rdquo; said International Data Corp (  IDC ) senior\nInternet analyst Nathan Midler . \n\n \n\n\" There is going to be a lot of growth of SMS for quite a\nwhile .\n\n\nWhat drives this growth is the number of people who keep coming\nonline . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nIDC has forecast the Internet population on the mainland will\ngrow from 48.5 million last year to 68.3 million this year . \n\n \n\nWireless solutions have not only provided remarkable revenue ,\nthey have also helped China  ' s big three Internet portals - Sina , Sohu and\nNetEase - to return to the black after years of losses on the poorly\nperforming Nasdaq stock market . \n\n \n\nHowever , Mr Midler warned the portals should start developing\nsomething else before the SMS bandwagon lost momentum . \n\n \n\n\" They can look into search engines and start up a similar\nmodel to Google , which is extremely successful in the United States and is\nchanging the way people perceive search engines and the inspiration behind\nmoney-making (  opportunities ) , &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\nThe US search engine carries out 200 million Internet searches a\nday . \n\n \n\nAs a private company , it does not disclose its figures but\nanalysts estimate its revenue has reached more than US&dollar;500 million a\nyear , with operating profit margins of more than 30 per cent . \n\n \n\n\" The three portals need to focus on areas . . . like\nonline travel and gaming , &rdquo;

Lin Heung Tea House was first established in Guangzhou .\n\n\nIn 1926 , one of the partners - Yien Lok-tin - opened a Hong Kong\nbranch on Queen  ' s Road in Central , and another on Canton Road in Mongkok\nwhich was closed 10 years ago . \n\n \n\nLin Heung Tea House arrived in its present neighbourhood in 1996\n, but was originally located on the opposite side of the street .\n\n\nBoth Hong Kong shops were run by Yien  ' s family .  \n\n \n\nThe teahouse faced tough times in the 1930s when water supplies\nto Hong Kong were limited , and again when the region was disrupted by the\nSino-Japanese war .\n\n\nChina  ' s Cultural Revolution also took its toll in the  '  60s . \n\n \n\nLin Heung  ' s basic business stayed afloat , however , and at\nleast one long-serving staff member can recall the ups and downs . \n\n \n\nFormer administrator Yien Chi-chung , 83 , took a job as helper\nin Lin Heung Tea House when he was 13 years old . \n\n \n\nHe and Lin Heung grew up together . \n\n \n\nHe said the company  ' s heyday had been in the years before the\nJapanese invasion , but its prestige was restored after the war . \n\n \n\nDuring the water shortages of the 1930s and  '  40s , in order to\nkeep the business going , staff brought clean water to work with them or drew\nwater in buckets from a well in what is now Sheung Wan market . \n\n \n\nThis enabled them to make tea and dim sum , and while they\novercame the water problem , when war broke out the conflict almost finished\nthe teahouse . \n\n \n\nYien remembered how the company tried to stay open during the\nwar , but the staff came to work under extremely dangerous conditions . \n\n \n\nThe Japanese fired cannons over Victoria Harbour towards Hong\nKong Island , and a round fell into the teahouse .\n\n\nThe staff hostel above was hit , but no one was hurt . \n\n \n\nAnti-Japanese thinking was not allowed under the occupying\nregime .\n\n\nDuring the occupation Chinese opera companies were invited to\nperform in Lin Heung Tea House , but no female singer who performed a\npro-Chinese song was killed along with some of the owners , staff and other\nowners .\n\n\nAfter that the teahouse was closed until the war ended .\n\n\nCompared with problems during the war , the riot in 1967 was a minor\nevent . \n\n \n\nLin Heung Tea House has been famous for decades for its Chinese\nwedding cakes and mookcakes .\n\n\nEspecially during the Mid-autumn Festivals , people queue for\nmooncakes because the shop  ' s lotus has always been famous for fragrance and\ntaste .  \n\n \n\n Atmospheric... the d\u00e9cor reflects a different time ,\nabove .\n\n\nTasty cakes are a speciality , right .\n\n\nPictures by PEONY SZE .  \n\n \n\n\" Many senior officials received only Lin Heung mooncakes\nas gifts , &rdquo; Yien said . \n\n \n\nLin Heung mooncakes with traditional , yellow lotus seed paste\nfaced keen competition today , however .\n\n\nYien said the new generation preferred white lotus seed or cakes\nadorned with cartoons of Garfield , Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pool . \n\n \n\nAs with traditional mooncakes , the Chinese wedding cakes that\nremained popular into the  '  70s seemed to have lost their appeal . \n\n \n\nTraditional cakes implied different sentiments; for example ,\nthe red liang-su represented good luck , the yellow one brought wealth , and\nthe white one represented perfection . \n\n \n\nIn the old days , the rich liked to give as many wedding cakes\nas they could to relatives and friends to win prestige and demonstrate their\nwealth .\n\n\nSome brought hundreds of kilograms of cakes . \n\n \n\nLin Heung Tea House is decorated in traditional style , with\npendant lamps and fans , Chinese paintings , kettles , and a floor mosaic .\n\n\n \n\nThere  ' s one feature in particular you  ' d be unlikely to find in\nmost restaurants today; Lin Heung still has spittoons sitting around the\nfloor , although you  ' ll be relieved to know they  ' re not used in the\ntraditional manner . \n\n \n\nThe silvery ones look rather like rubber bins , and add a\nnostalgic touch . \n\n \n\nOn a busy weekday you will find crowds of older patrons and\ntheir younger family members .\n\n\nExecutive chef Lung Tim said it was common to see youngsters and\nolder patrons as well as visitors from overseas having morning tea there ,\nsimply because there were only two traditional teahouses remaining in Hong\nKong . \n\n \n\nThroughout its 75-year-history , Lin Heung has preserved a\nsimple and a old-fashioned style , not only in decoration but also its food .\n\n\nFor example , pig liver is a favourite with many who enjoy\ntraditional fare , including local food columnist Choi Lan . \n\n \n\nThere is also fish head and pig steamed buns , not to mention\nthe ever-popular dim sum . \n\n \n\nCustomers include comedy star Chiau sing-chi and Secretary for\nJustice Elsie Leung Oi-sie . \n\n \n\nTo visit Lin Heung Tea House is to leave the present on the\nstreet outside; inside , you can savour Hong Kong  ' s past as well as in any\nmuseum , with the added benefit of delicious food to revive the hungry\nhistorian . \n\n \n\n Peony is a summer intern from Hong Kong Shun Yan College .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a945ee3a-f875-426f-8d2a-17a0221a3a51", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.961230+00:00"}
{"text": "INTRODUCTION : ( CALVINISM , CAPITALISM ) \n\n\n\n Max Weber theorized that Calvinism fostered the Protestant ethic of hard\nwork and that Protestantism was an important influence on the development of\nCapitalism .\n\n\nCalvinism was the faith which the political and cultural struggles of\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were fought in most highly developed\ncountries such as the Netherlands , England , and France . \n\n\nAccording to An Encyclopedia of religion , Calvinism is \n\" that system of theology and church organization and practice with\ngrew out of the work of John Calvin .\n\n\nTheologically , it is marked by the supreme role of Scripture in\nrevelation , the interpretation of the same being under the guidance of the\nHoly spirit . &rdquo;   It shows that\na solid base for ethics is established in the concept that the ability to\nlive the Christian Law is evidence of probable election .\n\n\nCalvinism is rooted in the concept of predestination , which holds\nthat before they are born , certain people are selected for heaven and others\nfor hell .\n\n\nNothing anyone does in this world can change this .\n\n\n( 3 ) The Calvinists consequently were anxious to find\nout whether they were among those chosen for salvation .\n\n\nWorldly success , especially the financial success that grew out of\nstrict discipline , hard work and self-control , was seen as proof that a\nperson was among the select few .\n\n\n( 4 ) It was Weber  ' s view that Capitalism really\nblossomed only with the advent of Calvinism . \n\n\n Then , simply put , Weber defines the spirit of Capitalism is that :\n\n\n  \" in conformity with the Old Testament . . .\nasceticism looked upon the pursuit of wealth as an end in itself as highly\nreprehensible , but the attainment of it as a fruit of labour in a calling\nwas a sign of God  ' s blessing .\n\n\nAnd even more important : the religious valuation of restless ,\ncontinuous , systemic work in a worldly calling , as the highest means to\nasceticism , and at the same time the sure stand most evident proof of\nrebirth and genuine faith , must have been the most powerful conceivable\nlever for the expansion of that attitude toward life . &rdquo; \n\n\n( Max Weber , 1985 : 172 )  \n\n\n It means that the spirit of Capitalism is a set of dispositions or\nmotives encouraging an ascetic life style as an end in self . \n\n\n  THE RELATION BETWEEN PROTESTANTISM AND CAPITALISM  \n\n\n In Weber  ' s view , Protestantism , especially in its Calvinistic forms ,\nwas bound directly to the rise of modern Capitalism . \n\n\n The concept of \" calling &rdquo; is the central link for Weber\nbetween the religious Protestant ethic and the spirit of Capitalism .\n\n\nIn his descriptions of Calvinism , Weber emphasizes the belief in\npredestination .\n\n\nSince God is omnipotent , he must have determined the whole pattern\nof creation for eternity . \n\n\nThe belief in predestination applied to personal salvation became\ncrucial for the development of a capitalist spirit &longdash; by increasing\nthe glory of God through a life of systematic self-control and to do the God\nwill is man  ' s first duty .\n\n\nIt states that Weber seeks to demonstrate that the Protestant ethic\nwith its emphasis on a \" calling &rdquo; work for the glorification of\nGod , and opposition to certain worldly ways served as an important spur to\nthe development of Capitalism . \n\n\n It was for religious motives that the puritans turned with full force\nagainst the relaxed enjoyment of life and the pursuit of pleasure .\n\n\n \" If God shows one of this elect a chance of profit he\nmust do it with purpose . &rdquo;  said Richard Baxter . \n\n\nYet the pursuit of profit combined with a denial of the pleasure of\nconspicuous consumption produced an economic spirit .\n\n\nThis had the effect of freeing the acquisition of goods from\ntraditionalistic ethics &longdash; it was no longer sinful or dubious\nmorality , to make a profit in trade .\n\n\nThe result of these injunctions , then , was to promote the constant\naccumulation of capital through an ascetic compulsion to save .\n\n\nThus , religious asceticism remodeled the world and gave material\ngoods their inexorable power in history . \n\n\n In tracing the affinity between the bourgeois life pattern and certain\ncomponents of the religious stylization of life , Weber emphasized the\ngradual genesis of a psychological habit which enabled men to meet the\nrequirements of early modern Capitalism .\n\n\nThat is , the Protestants went about his business with sturdy\nconfidence that Providence purposely enabled him to prosper for God  ' s glory .\n\n\nOn the other hand , the hand-worker or laborer , with his willingness\nto work , derived his sense of a religious state of grace from his\nconscientiousness in his calling .\n\n\nMoreover , because of the abomination of hoarding accumulated in the\nexercise of a calling was turned back into the business enterprise .\n\n\nIts significance for the development of capitalism is obvious .\n\n\nThat is , Protestantism   led  to methodical\nrationalization of activity and the consequent encouragement of capitalist\nbehavior and attitudes . \n\n\n  Criticism on Weber  ' s thesis  \n\n\n Weber adjudged the influence of Protestantism on Capitalism , his\nanalysis has been criticized from many standpoints . \n\n\n Felix Rachfahl , raised several issues that were to recur in subsequence\ndebates .\n\n\nFirst , he argued , the capitalistic dichotomy have been\noverstretched .\n\n\nCapitalism did not require Calvin or the Reformation and Weber\nignored more general motivations like power , honour , security that gave\nmuch greater impetus to capitalist behaviour than did religion . \n\n\nIndeed for Rachfahl , religion influence can be absorbed into the\neffect of wider social relations .\n\n\nI also consider Capitalism emerged as the cumulative result of social\n, political , economic and religious forces .\n\n\nSecondly ,  \" inner-worldly asceticism was not peculiar\nto Protestantism . &rdquo;  \n\n\nIn fact , it was common to Catholic laity and was actually rejected\nby many Calvinists .\n\n\nThirdly , he provided some specific examples :\n\n\nDutch capitalism had little to do with Protestant sects , while in\nthe USA in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , many people practiced\nworldly   asceticism  but lived in agrarian , not\ncapitalist economy .\n\n\nIn England Capitalism antedated Protestantism .  \n\n\n Tawney    accused   Weber  ' s thesis appear\nto be one-sided and over strained .\n\n\nHe says ,  \" Weber seems to explain by reference to\nmoral and intellectual influences developments which-have their principal\nexplanation in another region altogether . &rdquo;  \n\n\nCapitalism existed in Fifteenth-century Venice and Florence , which\nwere Catholic .\n\n\nThe subsequent development of Capitalism in Holland and England in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was due  to \"\ndiscoveries and the results that followed from them . &rdquo;  \n\n\nFrom the above argument , I guess the meaning of that it is\nartificial to talk as though capitalist enterprises could not appear until\nreligious changes had produced a capitalist spirit . \n\n\n Robertson argues that both Protestantism and Catholicism were ambiguous\nregarding Capitalism .\n\n\nSee claim that  \" the spirit of Capitalism was not the\noffspring of Puritanism , but the latter was a tonic for it . &rdquo;\n  \n\n\n In Sombart view , the human instinct compels people to collect money ,\nespecially gold . \n\n\nFrom this , the capitalistic spirit does not shape the economic\nactivities .\n\n\nOther scholars like Walker and Borkenau , Troeltsch also leveled\ncriticisms against Weber  ' s thesis . \n\n\n In the following , I would bring out some questions and give criticisms .\n\n\nCapitalism , appeared only in the West , during the sixteenth and\nseventeenth centuries .\n\n\nYet China , India , had at certain period conditions that might have\nmade capitalist development possible .\n\n\nWhat conditions then were specific to the West ?\n\n\nWhat existed there and not elsewhere , that can account for\ncapitalist development ?\n\n\nI would just as well argue a reverse , that the social and economic\nchanges le to the rise of industrialism and Capitalism stimulated the\nemergent of the new Protestantism .\n\n\n\n Weber limited his data to an ideal type of the spirit of Capitalism and\nexcluded all other direct economic and social factors that could be held\nresponsible for the growth in capitalist mentality .\n\n\nDid Weber deny the influence of trade , money , technology ,\npolitical centralization , legal rationalization , secularism , luxury and\nmany other elements that had been singly and severally advanced to explain\nthe rise of Capitalism in the West ?\n\n\nHe did not .\n\n\nAll of these , to a great extent , had been essential . \n\n\n While there is readiness to accept the congruity between Calvinism and\nCapitalism , I would question that Calvinism emerged later than Capitalism where\nthe latter became decisively power .\n\n\nFrom this , did Calvinism regard as the subsequent development of\nCapitalism ? \n\n\n Weber  ' s employment of the ideal-type method leads to various distortion\n, such as his overemphasis the concepts of vocation and predestination .\n\n\nThe whole thesis appears suffused by a tendency to idealization ,\nwith a comparative neglect of secular factors , economic , political and\ntechnological .\n\n\nIn fact , he was charged with overemphasis on the religious or\nideological factor . \n\n\n I agree that although religious belief did indeed affect economic\nbehaviour , the tent of Protestantism and Capitalism tended to support each\nother . \n\n\n When I examine some religious books , I find that Calvinist doctrines\nwere not so uniform as pictured them , nor was the work ethic confine to the\nProtestant value system .\n\n\nI whole-heartedly support Tawney  ' s argument .\n\n\nThat is  \" Protestantism was not a unified movement ,\nand different social doctrines were fought out within it . &rdquo; \n\n\n\nThus , in Puritanism an element which was revolutionary ,\nCollectivism which grasped an iron discipline , and individualism which got\nrid of the savorless of human ordinances .\n\n\nFrom this view , Weber oversimplified the Protestantism . \n\n\n Lastly , I allege that Weber  ' s thesis neglected the time coefficient .\n\n\nAssume that , for instance , Weber  ' s interpretation of Calvinist\ntheology was correct and this would result in activism , dynamism , industry\netc . , the question still remained since these influence did not begin to\nexert significant effect only after capitalism had already reached dominance\nposition . \n\n\n  Conclusion :  \n\n\n In conclusion , Weber  ' s thesis became a dispute because it posed\nquestions in a challenged and original way .\n\n\nNevertheless , his first contribution to a systematic sociology of\nreligion was sound in intention .\n\n\nSince Weber  ' s essay on the Protestant Ethic is an introduction to\ndomain of sociology of religion which it serves stake out .\n\n\nIt pave the way for the formulation of an adequate social theory of\nreligion .\n\n\nIt also stimulates generation of researchers in this new disciple and\nfinally , he is regarded as the precursor of functional analysis in culture\nhistory .  \n\n\n\n\n Justice , in another word , fairness , is the common target which all\njurisdiction suppose to achieve .\n\n\nLord Denning once defined justice as  \" what the\nright-minded members of the community - those who have the right spirit\nwithin them - believe to be fair . &rdquo;  \n\n\n Lord Denning , The Road to justice , p . 4 \n\n\nSince justice has to be believed by the community , the ideal of\njustice is that justice must not only be done , but also to be believed by\nthe community , the ideal of justice is that justice must not only be done ,\nbut also to be seen . \n\n\n In Hong Kong , over 90% of criminal proceedings are dealt with by the\nMagistrates  '  Courts .\n\n\nIt is our concern in this piece of writing to see how far the ideal\nof justice being achieved or departed in the Magistrates  '  courts .\n\n\nWe may analyze the issue by looking at the legal principles the\nMagistrates  '  courts adopt and , under these principles , how the Magistrates  ' \nfunction and some special features which indicate how successful the ideal of\njustice being achieved . \n\n\n   Independence of Judiciary   \n\n\n One very important principle of achieving justice is Independence of\nJudiciary .\n\n\nUnder this principle , the Magistrate should be dependent on no man ,\neven the government , to ensure that the accused be fairly tried .\n\n\nHowever , under the present system , Magistrates are employed by\ncontract with the Government .\n\n\nThe Government can terminate the contract by a three months notice .\n\n\nIt is arguable that in such case , justice is not being seen to be\ndone since the Magistrate is not absolutely or obviously independent .\n\n\nEven the Magistrate may be actually very just and impartial , but it\ncannot be seen by the public . \n\n\n     Impartiality  of\nMagistrates   \n\n\n Magistrates must have no self interest in any case he has to try .\n\n\nHe must be impartial .\n\n\nSo the Magistrate should follow decided cases and give similar\njudgement to similar cases .\n\n\nAnd he is required to give reason of his decision in order to show\nhis impartiality .\n\n\nAlso , he should have no bias on neither party .\n\n\nWe can observe that in the Magistrates  '  Court the Chief Magistrate\nin court No . 1 will not try the case even though he may be just , since he\nhas got the first impression of the case and know about the background of the\naccused in the first appearance in court .\n\n\nThe case should be tried by another judge who will have no bias and\nbe seen to have no bias to the accused .\n\n\nMoreover , the Magistrate who try the case will only know about the\ncriminal record of the accused before giving sentences .\n\n\nThis is to ensure that no injustice will be done based on the past\nrecord of the accused . \n\n\n Justice seemed being done based on the above nature of the Magistrate .\n\n\nHowever , it seems to me questionable that the great responsibility\nof putting an accused into the jail for two years by the impression and\nunderstanding of one fallible human being .\n\n\nThe Magistrate himself may be just but the heavy workload and\nsimilar cases tried everyday may make him fell routine and bored .\n\n\nHe then may not be very careful in hearing the case and thus justice\nmay not be actually done .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c36c0fcd-72af-49f2-947c-6998df29e7a6", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.962389+00:00"}

he said . \n\n \n\nThe revelations come at a difficult time for the PAA .\n\n\nThe authority is under fire from the United Democrats for alleged\nabuse of entertainment and travel allowances , while the Government will this\nweek start to seek legislators  '  approval for a further &dollar;564 million\nfunding for the PAA . \n\n \n\nThe authority is still recovering from the controversial\ndeparture of former chief executive Richard Allen , who left with a pay-off\nof more than &dollar;5 million under as yet unexplained circumstances . \n\n \n\nYesterday , the current PAA chief executive officer , Hank\nTownsend , admitted he was \" not aware of the controversies &rdquo;\nconcerning Mr Judy during his tenure in Miami , adding he \" would not\nimagine &rdquo; the PAA board would have any knowledge of them . \n\n \n\n\" How do you expect people in Hongkong , who are all busy\nin Government or business , to be aware of allegations made in a newspaper in\nMiami in the United States ?\n\n\nWhy would you expect them ( the PAA board ) to know\nthat ? &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\nDr Townsend , who replaced Mr Allen as head of the PAA four\nmonths ago , pledged to conduct an investigation into the allegations made\nagainst Mr Judy during his time in Florida . \n\n \n\nBut he cautioned against \" waving allegations &rdquo; at Mr\nJudy , who was recognised worldwide as an experienced airport executive ,\nadding any possible action would only be taken after a thorough investigation\nwas carried out . \n\n \n\nHe said since Mr Judy was hired by his predecessor , Mr Allen ,\nhe was unsure if the interim appointment had the board  ' s approval . \n\n \n\nMr Judy was hired by Mr Allen last October as the PAA  ' s interim\ncommercial director .\n\n\nHe is also interim operations director . \n\n \n\nMr Judy helped build the Miami airport into one of the world  ' s\nbiggest , but US legislators and local Miami newspapers grew increasingly\nworried over his allegedly autocratic business style and lack of public\naccountability .\n\n\nHe was known as \" the tsar of the airport &rdquo; . \n\n \n\nDuring Mr Judy  ' s 18-year period as aviation boss in Miami ,\nconsulting contracts were alleged to have been \" funnelled &rdquo; to ,\namong others , his or his key aides  '  friends and acquaintances . \n\n \n\nMr Judy was never indicted on any criminal charges . \n\n \n\nHe was described as \" arrogant &rdquo; , \" too\nunaccountable &rdquo; , and \" above questioning &rdquo; .\n\n\nHis critics claimed he ran the Miami Airport as his own personal   fiefdom  , answering to few people , if anyone . \n\n \n\n\" It seems that Mr Judy at times thinks he  ' s above\nquestioning by elected public officials , &rdquo; said a local elected\ncommissioner at the time . \n\n \n\nAmerican legislators and the  Miami Herald  in 1989\nconducted a series of investigations into Mr Judy  ' s business methods .\n\n\nMr Judy retired in the same year . \n\n \n\nLast week , Mr Judy told the  Sunday Morning Post  he\ndenied having \" misused &rdquo; funds or funnelled contracts to friends\n, insisting \" not a single dime was misused &rdquo; during his time as\ndirector . \n\n \n\nHe also said the commissioners , or US legislators , who raised\nquestions concerning him had since either been \" thrown out by the\nvoters &rdquo; or were \" under criminal investigation &rdquo;\nthemselves . \n\n \n\nMr Judy said : &rdquo; ... they wanted to compromise the\nintegrity of the business in that place .\n\n\nI wouldn't have anything to do with it . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nHe also claimed during his time in Miami he ran one of the most\n\" economic and honest airports &rdquo; in the United States . \n\n \n\nMr Judy said the  Miami Herald  had \" their own\naxe to grind &rdquo; by running the articles . \n\n \n\nThe  Herald  ' s  executive editor Doug Clifton said :\n\" I can't even imagine what he is talking about .\n\n\nIt sounds like nonsense to me . \n\n \n\n\" We are a newspaper that takes a pretty aggressive\napproach to the auditing function , and so we monitor the affairs of\ngovernment quite closely and expenditure of public money quite closely .\n\n\nThat  ' s the only motivation we have . \n\n \n\n\" Our coverage of Mr Judy was long .\n\n\nWe reported some of his lavish ways over years ... decades .\n\n\nWe have no special interest in him per se , just in reporting that\npublic dollars are being spent . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nOne of the Miami commissioners closely involved in the case was\nLarry Hawkins .\n\n\nHe told the  Sunday Morning Post  Mr Judy \" was asked\nto leave &rdquo; because of disagreement with his manager over his management\nstyle , \" as well as the allegations that were made against him &rdquo; .\n\n\n \n\nThe newspaper  ' s series of articles on Mr Judy alleged , among\nother things , money was funnelled through the airport  ' s engineering firm\nvia loopholes in two contracts signed with the firm in 1966 . \n\n \n\nIt claimed that , by using the chief engineering firm \" as\na conduit to get the money to consultants &rdquo; , airport officials for 18\nyears had routinely bypassed a requirement to seek Metro Commission approval\nfor any consulting deal worth more than US&dollar;1,000 . \n\n \n\nMr Judy also claimed questions were raised during his time in\noffice because \" everybody was there trying to make a buck ... and\ncommissioners came in with a huge campaign contribution that came from the\nfinancial community keen to negotiate bonds &rdquo; . \n\n \n\nHe also denied having given contracts to friends , saying\neverything was documented and properly accounted for . \n\n \n\nHe said his \" tsar of the airport &rdquo; reputation\n\" came from those who had a special interest &rdquo; and would not want\nto bid competitively for a contract .  \n\n \n\n\n I want to die , says HIV schoolboy   \n\n\n By MARIANA WAN  \n\n \n\nAN HIV-infected boy expelled from school two years ago is still\nbeing taught by a tutor despite the pledges of education chiefs that he would\nbe found a place in a regular school . \n\n \n\nLast night the mother of Ming Tsai , 13 , said the situation had\ndriven her son to threaten suicide . \n\n \n\nShe said he told her on Thursday : \" I am no good .\n\n\nI do not want to live .\n\n\nI want to kill myself . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nMing Tsai  ' s well-publicised expulsion sparked a public outcry\nfollowed by a pledge to help from Education Department officials last year .\n\n\n \n\nHis tearful mother said yesterday : \" I do not know what to\ndo now .\n\n\nHe was in tears .\n\n\nHe said he did not want to give me more trouble . \n\n \n\n\" It took me so long to calm him down .\n\n\nIt has never happened before , that he would talk about taking his\nlife . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nShe is unsure what has prompted Ming Tsai  ' s depression , but\nsuspects he is desperate to return to a normal school . \n\n \n\n\" He knew he had the AIDS virus .\n\n\nHe would cry to himself , but he has never talked about killing\nhimself .\n\n\nMy husband and I suspect he wants to have a normal school life .\n&rdquo; \n\n \n\nMing Tsai , a haemophiliac , was expelled from a Sha Tin school\nwhen his headmaster learned of his condition , the result of receiving blood\ncontaminated by the virus . \n\n \n\nAlthough the Director of Education , Mr Dominic Wong Shing-wah ,\npledged in December he would help , the boy had yet to be placed in a school .\n\n\n \n\nMing Tsai is receiving special tutoring for a weekly total of\nfive hours provided by the department . \n\n \n\nBut his mother said : \" That is so different from a normal\nschool setting .\n\n\nHe is studying with one other child .\n\n\nHe said he did not want to go back .\n\n\nHe said he wanted to go to a normal school . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe mother said another possible cause of Ming Tsai  ' s depression\ncould be that the boy had received unwarranted pressure from his teacher .\n\n\nShe said the teacher could have suspected he was HIV-infected . \n\n \n\n\" The teacher asked him where he lived and which school his\nbrother went to .\n\n\nShe might be trying to confirm her suspicions .\n\n\nI am afraid that could have hurt his feelings . \n\n \n\n\" my husband and I do not want to send him back there .\n\n\nIf the Education Department cannot find him a normal school we will\nask a relative to give him private tutoring . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe mother said she last heard from the Education Department last\nmonth when officials offered Ming Tsai a school place in Tai Po or Kowloon .\n\n\n \n\n\" I told the officials it would be too far away .\n\n\nHe is an ill child and I still have his eight-year-old brother to\nlook after .\n\n\nTransportation will be a big problem . \n\n \n\n\" The official said it would be difficult to find him a\nplace in Sha Tin after all the publicity .\n\n\nOther Sha Tin headmasters know about him .\n\n\nThe official only promised to try again . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nAnother mother whose HIV-infected son had also been deprived of a\nnormal education said : \" I don't understand why the Education\nDepartment still cannot find him a place after all this time .

in his cramped archive in\nMei Foo , the drawer squeaks and sticks .\n\n\nPacked inside are hundreds of index cards - snapshots of history .\n\n\n \n\nCuttings form local newspapers have been meticulously copied ,\nsuch as this small item from the mid-19th century: \" Wu Ching-sui ,\n1832 , Nov 29 .\n\n\nLocal estate , administered 8 Min Ko Terraces , &dollar;20,300 to\nconcubine Yeung Shuk-ying . \n\n \n\nFor many , this trivial piece of information is not worth\nrecording , but not to 83-year old Smith , who has spent most of his life as\na minister and history buff . \n\n \n\n\" There are two ways to look at history , &rdquo; says Smith\n, who started his archive more than 40 years ago .\n\n\n\" One is gathering all facts that fir an idea .\n\n\nThat  ' s the way most people do history , that  ' s the PhD way to do it .\n&rdquo; \n\n \n\nPausing as he squints through thick glasses , he continues:\n\" The other way , the much longer way , is not to have a thesis or any\nparticular thing in mind .\n\n\nYou start picking out the facts .\n\n\nThe facts are like twigs and gradually you see that each twig is\nconnected to a branch .\n\n\nYou begin to see all kinds of stories , and slowly you begin to see\nthe whole forest . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nSmith  ' s homegrown forest is filled with thousands of index cards\n, folders and documents containing information on births , birthdays ,\nbaptisms , engagements , weddings , obituaries , land rates , property\ntransactions , court records , bankruptcy notes , company notices , thefts\nand murders .\n\n\nThe list is endless . \n\n \n\nOver 40 years , Smith has painstakingly penned and typed each\npiece of information .\n\n\nSnippets such as this one: \" February 3 , 1939 , married Hong\nKong Hotel , Chan Wah-chen , seventh daughter of Mr Chan Yee-ho , a\nprominent Swatow merchant to Ma Ho-tung , so of Mr Ma Tsak-man , manager of\nHong Kong Swatow Commercial Bank (  now Asia Commercial Bank]\" . \n\n \n\nFor smith , each card is like a narrow window to another age .\n\n\nThe rich rub shoulders with regular fold .\n\n\nAn index card on Gordon Wu , founder of Hopewell Holdings , sits next\nto Wu Ching-sui , who is completely unknown to the public . \n\n \n\n\" I have a belief that history is shaped by the common\nperson , &rdquo; he says .\n\n\n\" Twigs could be anything from marriage announcements to\nobituaries to property transactions , to land records and notices .\n\n\nYou open the newspaper , and you see (  them ) . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nSmith  ' s own story is worthy of inclusion .\n\n\nBorn in Dayton , Ohio , he fell in love with genealogy after delving\ninto his family tree during a school assignment when he was 13 .\n\n\nHe continued to pursue his hobby while at DePaw University in\nIllinois in 1936 and four years later at the Union Theological Seminary in\nNew York .  \n\n \n\nAfter spending 13 years as a minister at St Stephen  ' s United\nChurch of Christ in Pennsylvania , he moved to Hong Kong in 1961 as a\nmissionary and lecturer on theology at the then Chinese University . \n\n \n\nSince the university was short of money , Smith decided to\n\" pursue his lifelong hobby full-time\" .\n\n\nWith an inheritance from his father and a succession of part-time\njobs , he was able to pass his days at Hong Kong  ' s public archives . \n\n \n\n\" I  ' d go in at 9.15 in the morning and not even go to\nlunch , &rdquo; he recalls .\n\n\n\" People could never understand how I could sit there all day\nlong and look at those records .\n\n\nTo me , it was utterly fascinating , sort of like a jigsaw puzzle .\n&rdquo; \n\n \n\nTo finance his passion , Smith has to live a simple life .\n\n\n\" I am not rich , but I live comfortably , &rdquo; he says , as\na fan churns the sticky summer air around in his cramped flat . \n\n \n\nHis legacy is contained in the thousands of files , the stories .\n\n\nThey may be small pieces of the past , but when they are put together\n, a picture develops of the history of areas such as Kennedy Town , Aberdeen\nand Sham Shui Po .\n\n\nThe end result is two large historical tomes written by Smith:  A\nSense of History - Studies in the Social and Urban History of Hong Kong and\nChinese Christians: Elites , Middlemen , and the Church in Hong Kong  .\n\n\n \n\nSmith  ' s \" hobby &rdquo;

he\nsays .\n\n\n\" I  ' m frightened everything will get mixed up . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThese days he savours his almost monk-like existence in the\ntwo-room flat .\n\n\nIt is the forest of facts he loves most .\n\n\n\" All I know is that I  ' ve had a comfortable life , &rdquo;\nsays Smith , who plans to donate his files to the Library of Congress in\nWashington , DC , after his death . \n\n \n\n\" It  ' s very hard for people to understand but ... I love\nto do it . It  ' s a full-time hobby . &rdquo;\n\n\nAnd a way of life . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Brushes with history   \n\n\nOf brushes , ink and paper , calligraphers create momentous works of\nart and philosophy .\n\n\n Peter Barker  and  Natalie Kan  meet a\npremier purveyor of these highly refined tools \n\n \n\nWOLF hair or wool ?\n\n\nMouse whiskers or tiger tail hairs ?\n\n\nThese are the questions that Chinese calligraphy artists and painters\nface when selecting just the right brush for their next work .\n\n\nThe man with the answers is Monty Lee Mon-tat , the 38-year old\nsecond-generation owner of the Man Luen Choon Chinese Stationery shop in\nCentral . \n\n \n\n\" A long wolf-hair brush is the most expensive - as much as\n&dollar;7,000 , &rdquo; he says .\n\n\n\" The people who buy these are professional artists , and they know\nit  ' s worth the money . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe shelves around him are filled with hundreds of brushes , from\ndelicate items the size of a pencil to heavy-duty jobs that look as if they\nwould take two hands to pick up and would leave a brushstroke as thick as\nyour arm .\n\n\nMost of them are cheaper than the exotic fur models , usually costing\nless than &dollar;100 for the standard wool varieties . \n\n \n\nLee says there is a never-ending demand for the tools of the\nancient Chinese arts .\n\n\nThe twin arts of painting and calligraphy are inseparably interwoven\n, with the character of a painted poem valued for their graphic appeal as\nmuch as their meaning .\n\n\nMany painters will add some words or a poem to their work to overlay\ntheir feelings on the visual image . \n\n \n\n\" Many people still practise these arts , &rdquo; Lee says .\n\n\n\" They learn from the age of 10 onwards and come from many\ndifferent walks of life .\n\n\nWe see children , doctors , accountants and lawyers buying brushes .\n\n\nEven Nobel Prize-winner for literature , Gao Xingjian , buys his\nbrushes here because he can't go to the mainland .\n\n\nWe even mail them to him when he  ' s in France . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nLee counts many of the top painters from the mainland , Taiwan\nand Hong Kong among his customers , including the renowned Fan Zeng and even\nAnson Chan  ' s mother Fang Zhaoling , a widely acclaimed painter . \n\n \n\nThe brushes are as varied , coming from the mainland , Taiwan ,\nKorea and Japan , so there is something to suit the requirements of every\nartist .\n\n\n\" Each one has their own style , &rdquo; Lee says . \n\n \n\nHe pulls out a Guangdong grass brush the size of a kitchen broom .\n\n\n\" This one gives a hard effect to the brushstrokes , &rdquo; he\nsays .\n\n\nIt is designed to give a rough , streaked appearance to the ink as it\nis laid on the paper .\n\n\nSimilar brushes are made from bamboo and small tree branches shredded\ninto coarse bristles on one end . \n\n \n\nOther artists will choose softer brushes - wool , puma fur , pig\nbristles or features - to give a softer effect to their painting or\ncalligraphy .\n\n\nSome of them are very specialised: Lee produces a cow-horn handled\nbrush with lambswool bristles .\n\n\n\" This is for painting the lotus leaves , &rdquo; he says ,\npointing to one of the framed prints by famous masters that adorn the store .\n \n\n \n\nEvery aspect of painting and calligraphy is equally as\nspecialised .\n\n\nEach shelf in Lee  ' s extensive shop is carefully arranged with all\nmanner of accessories .\n\n\nThe artist  ' s main tool is the brush , but second to that is the\npaper .\n\n\nRolls and sheets of paper abound , both handmade and machine-produced\nfrom bamboo fibre , cotton or linen .  \n\n\n Brush tips  \n\n \n\n Those in the know use four well-established criteria to\njudge if a brush is up to standard   ?\n\n \n\nThe tip should be very finely pointed on a new brush with stiff\nbristles .  ?\n\n \n\nAfter soaking in water for 20 minutes , the bristles should splay\nout evenly and create a flat , straight end with no sign of a point .  ?\n\n \n\nBristles should be \" full\" , or thick and bushy .  ?\n\n \n\nThe bristles must be \" healthy &rdquo; - soft yet with a\nspringy rebound , so the brush will flex to provide the desired form without\nlosing its shape . \n\n \n\n\" Handmade is better , &rdquo; Lee says .\n\n\n\" A good paper will show you seven shades of black and grey ( \nink ) . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nMost of the traditional Chinese painting is in black ink , with\nsome mild colour washes used occasionally to add the artist  ' s feelings to a\npainting rather than for photographic-style realism . \n\n \n\n\" Henri Matisse  ' s style of painting is very much like\nChinese painting , &rdquo; Lee says , with a flourish towards the hundreds of\nart books that line the shop  ' s walls , collections of the Asian masters with\na few selected Westerners - notably Matisse and Picasso - among them .\n\n\nThe black ink outlines and stylised colour washes abound . \n\n \n\nThe ink itself is the third important element for the painter or\ncalligrapher .\n\n\nMade from wood ash , Chinese herbs and a plastic bonding agent , it\ncomes in a solid block the size of a mobile phone .\n\n\nMostly the ink is black , but red is also popular for signwriting and\nfor Taoist monks to use for writing papers to exorcise spirits . \n\n \n\nThe most sought-after luck red ink ,  jiu sa  , is as\nheavy as iron because of the minerals in it and costs up to &dollar;3,000 for\na small block .\n\n\nWhatever the colour , the ink is rubbed on the fourth important\nelement in the artist  ' s set , the ink stone , to grind it into powder .\n\n\nIt is then mixed with water in a depression carved into the ornate\nrock . \n\n \n\n\" The good stones are very smooth and don't soak up the\nwater quickly , &rdquo; Lee explains . \n\n \n\nApart from the essentials , the well-equipped artist will stock\nup on the accessories from Lee ' store .\n\n\nWho would try to get by without brass or ceramic brush-holders made\nin the shapes of cherubic figures ?\n\n\nAnd , of course , a pair of paperweights to hold the parchment flat\nare essential .\n\n\nYou can pick from rosewood , marble or even a Japanese brass\nrendition of Mount Fuji . \n\n \n\nThere is no need to get your fingers dirty grinding the ink\nblock down on the stone when a nifty pair of bamboo tongs will lock on to the\nblack stuff and save you the both .\n\n\nAnd when you have finished your day  ' s doodling , there is even a\nspecial bamboo mat to wrap around you brush after washing to dry it out and\nprotect it . \n\n \n\nThe range goes on and on: mortars and pestles to grind your own\nink; fans ready to be painted , complete with tiny stands to hold them firm;\nstone block ready to carve into your own \" chop &rdquo; to stamp the\ncorner of your painting - termed \" adding the eye to the dragon &rdquo;\n- and the special blades to do the carving . \n\n \n\nThere is always some new idea to improve the quality and range\nof products , &rdquo; Lee says .\n\n\nThe family has been sourcing and selling the specialised supplies\nsince his father , Lee Kwan-cheung , opened the store in 1956 .\n\n\nThe younger Lee has worked at the store since 1991 after spending\nfive years studying are at the Musasino Art University in Tokyo . \n\n \n\nOnly one sourcing mystery remains: how do you get the hairs our\nof a tiger  ' s tail - or a puma  ' s hide , for that matter - and live to make\nthem into a paintbrush afterwards ? \n\n \n\nAh , well , Lee explains , they come from old hides and rugs\nthat survive from the days when it was legal to hunt such exotic creatures .\n\n\nWith the price at &dollar;7,000 a brush , the supply is expected to\nlast the Lees into the next generation . \n\n \n\n Man Luen Choon Chinese Stationery, 2/F Harvest Building ,\n29-35 Wing Kut Street, Central .\n\n\nTelephone 2543 0615", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "1accc9a5-ef8c-45cc-83fe-edddf4ad3a56", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.965888+00:00"}
{"text": "INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY   \n\n\n   ESSAY TOPIC :\n\n\nDO YOU THINK CLASSICAL CONDITIONING , OPERANT CONDITIONING , OR\nOBSERVATIONAL LEARNING PLAYS A MORE IMPORTANT ROLE IN HUMAN LEARNINGS ?\n\n\nGIVE EXAMPLES .   \n\n\n Learning is very important .\n\n\nIt starts when you are still a baby .\n\n\nBesides the inborn behaviour , people need to learn so many things in\neveryday life .\n\n\nWalking , speaking writing , all of these are needed to learn .\n\n\nIn fact , all of us have so many chances to learn different subjects .\n\n\nThis time , we will focus on three types of learning and discuss\nwhich one of these three types of learning plays a more important role in\nhuman learning .\n\n\nThey are classical conditioning , operant conditioning and\nobservational learning .\n\n\nBefore discussing their importance , we must define what they are\nfirst .\n\n\nThere is some background information about them . \n\n\n Classical conditioning is a type of teaming in which stimulus acquires\nthe capacity to evoke a response that was originally evoke by another\nstimulus .\n\n\nPhobias , irrational fears of specific objects or situations , may be\na good example of classical conditioning .\n\n\nIf you had bitten by a dog when you are a child , you may be afraid\nof dogs after this event .\n\n\nMoreover , your fear may spill over to all types of dog , not just\nthe one biting you .\n\n\nIn this case , your fear is caused by classical conditioning .\n\n\nThis is also an example of stimulus generalization .\n\n\n Ivan   Pavlov  , was the first person studying\nabout classical conditioning in 1903 .\n\n\nHis demonstration was about the salivating of dog .\n\n\nHe noticed that dogs accustomed to the procedure would start\nsalivating before the meat powder was presented .\n\n\nThese are considered as unconditioned stimulus and unconditioned\nresponse and they occur without previous conditioning .\n\n\nIvan then used the ringing of a bell as another stimulus to be paired\nas a presentation with the meat powder .\n\n\nAfter a number of times , he found that the dogs responded by\nsalivating to the sound of bell alone .\n\n\nSo , the sound of the bell is considered as conditioned stimulus ,\nwhich occurs because of previous conditioning .\n\n\nIn the first example of classical conditioning , the bite by the dog\n, the unconditioned stimulus is the pain caused by the bite and the\nconditioned stimulus is dog .\n\n\nThe responses of fear is considered as both unconditioned and\nconditioned responses , depending on which stimulus it refer to . \n\n\n There are many other kinds of example of classical conditioning besides\nphobias .\n\n\nIn learning process , the unconditioned stimulus is the reinforcing\nstimulus while the conditioned responses is the learned responses .\n\n\nThere is a one-to-one or biological relation between them .\n\n\nThe conditioned responses in classical conditioning is determined by\nthe biological nature of the unconditioned stimulus because the conditioned\nresponses is a derivative of the unconditioned responses elicited by the\nunconditioned stimulus .\n\n\nTherefore , the change of unconditioned stimulus ( reinforcer\n) will lead the conditioned responses ( learned responses\n) change .\n\n\nIn classical conditioning , the typical kinds of responses are\ninvoluntary and reflex responses . \n\n\n Besides classical conditioning , there is another form of\nconditioning-operant conditioning , a form of learning in which voluntary\nresponses come to be controlled by their consequences .\n\n\nCompared with classical conditioning , operant conditioning plays a\nmore important role in human learning since it governs a larger share of\nhuman behaviour .\n\n\nIt is not difficult to understand as all of us know that most human\nresponses are voluntary rather than reflexive . \n\n\n B. F. Skinner conducted some deceptively simple research on operant\nconditioning in the 1930  ' s .\n\n\nThe fundamental principle of operant conditioning introduced is that\norganisms tend to repeat those responses that are followed by favorable\nconsequences .\n\n\nIn Skinner  ' s experiment , rats and pigeons were used as subjects .\n\n\nThey were placed in an operant chamber that bas come to be better\nknown as a \" Skinner box &rdquo; alone .\n\n\nIn \" Skinner box &rdquo; , a specific response was\nsystematically recorded while the consequences of the response were\ncontrolled .\n\n\nMeanwhile , a small bit of food was given to the subjects when they\nmade the designated response , pressing a small lever mounted on one side\nwall for rats and pecking a small disk mounted on one side wall for pigeons .\n\n\nAfter a period of time , Skinner found that the response rate of\nsubjects rapidly increased .\n\n\nThis rapid increase indicated that the subjects had learned the\ndesignated responses . \n\n\n In everyday life , operant conditioning play an important role .\n\n\nThe majority of teaming is voluntary and people often learn tasks\nsince they are attracted by the consequences that they know before learning\nthe tasks .\n\n\nStudying is a typical example that people use to explain how operant\nconditioning plays its role in human learning .\n\n\nClearly , studying is not a reflex response , people working hard in\nstudying since the stimulus events followed that studying , may be some\nrewards from parents , admiration from others or getting a good job in future .\n\n\n\n The last type of learning discussed is observational learning , it occurs\nwhen an organism  ' s responding is influenced by the observation of others ,\nwho are called models .\n\n\nAlbert Bandura ( 1977-1986 ) has investigate it\nextensively .\n\n\nIn fact , learning through observation accounts for a great deal of\nlearning in both animals and humans .\n\n\nIn order to learn through observation , you must pay attention to\nanother person  ' s behaviour and its consequence first .\n\n\nThen , retention is also important , you must store a mental\nrepresentation of what you have seen .\n\n\nFinally , the last two processes are reproduction and motivation .\n\n\nReproduction is converting your stored mental images into overt\nbehaviour while motivation is your encounter of which situation you believe\nthat the response is likely to pay off for you . \n\n\n Observational learning is important since it can explain why animals can\nalso learn complex human behaviour .\n\n\nObservation seems to be the only way that animals can learn through .\n\n\nSo , this prove that observation is an effective way of learning .\n\n\nIn human learning , observation also plays an important role ,\nespecially for children  ' s learning .\n\n\nChildren like to pay attention and imitate the behaviours of other ,\nadult is the model that they to imitate .\n\n\nIf you want to know the power of observational learning , the\ninfluence of television exerted on children will be a good answer .\n\n\nChildren are especially impressionable and easily accept ideas from\noutsides .\n\n\nSo , it is no wonder that they often pick up the responses from\nviewing models on television .\n\n\nMost people believe that there is a link between television violence\nand the growth in aggressive behaviour of children . \n\n\n When compared with the first two types of learning , classical\nconditioning and operant conditioning , observational learning seems to playa\nmore important role than the other two types .\n\n\nThe typical kind of responses in observational learning is voluntary\nresponses while that in classical conditioning is involuntary , reflex\nresponses .\n\n\nMoreover , the observer  ' s tendency to emit the response may be\nstrengthened or weakened , depending on the consequences observed .\n\n\nOn the other hand , although the typical kinds of responses in\noperant conditioning is also voluntary , it is usually governed by the\nsomatic nervous system . \n\n\n From the opinion of Albert Bandura , observational learning is not\nentirely separate from classical and operant conditioning .\n\n\nIn fact , observational learning extends the reach of these two types\nof conditioning processes greatly and both of them can take place vicariously\nthrough observational learning .\n\n\nTherefore , a conclusion can be drawn that observational learning\nplays a more important role among these three types of learning . \n\n\n

the study of\norganizational buyer behavior from consumer buyer behavior .  \n\n\n\n Actually , it is necessary to separate the study of organizational buyer\nbehavior from consumer buyer behavior .\n\n\nThe same consumer buyer behavior concepts cannot simply be applied to\nindividuals engaging in purchasing behavior as part of their job in the\norganization because the context is different . \n\n\n Consumer behavior may be defined as the decision process and physical\nactivity individual engage in when evaluating , acquiring , using or\ndisposing of goods and services .\n\n\nWhile organizational buyer behavior is defined as the decision\nprocess by which organizations establish the need for purchasing products and\nservices , and identify , evaluate , and choose among alternative brands or\nsuppliers .\n\n\nThere are some similarities between consumer and organizational\nbehavior as it is not an \" organization &rdquo; making the buying\ndecision but the people within the organization .\n\n\nBoth of them make purchase decision in order to satisfy their goals ,\nbut the goals are completely different  by purpose  .\n\n\nOrganizations have the goals of producing goods and services or\nreselling an item , so they buy products and services that allow them to\nefficiently engage in these activities .\n\n\nConsumers purchased for the purpose of individual or household\nconsumption . \n\n\n Besides different by purchasing goals , consumer and organizational\nbuying behavior are also different in several aspects , say  marketing\nstructure and demand , buyer characteristics , and decision processes and\nbuying pattern  . \n\n\n The market structure and demand for the organizational buyer are\ndifferent from that of consumer one by  ( 1 ) geographical\nconcentration , ( 2 ) size of buyers , ( 3 )\nderivation of demand , ( 4 ) elasticity of demand ( 5\n) fluctuation of demand and ( 6 ) format of the market\n . \n\n\n Firstly , organizational buyers are geographically more concentrated than\nconsumer markets .\n\n\nThere is a tendency for a specific industry to locate in a particular\narea due to the comparative advantage gained from concentration .\n\n\nFor example , if most of the garment industries are located in the\nwest part of the country , then the owner of a new garment factory would\nprobably like to set up its plant in the west part because of the comparative\nadvantages , like more materials suppliers , more skilled labour etc. . \n\n\n Secondly , organizational buyers are also concentrated by size in the\nmarket .\n\n\nThere may be only a few \" customers &rdquo; in the\norganizational market , but the size of the \" customers &rdquo; is very\nlarge .\n\n\nThe consumption of these \" customers &rdquo; may be larger than\nthe consumption of the whole individual buyers . \n\n\n Thirdly , organizational demand is derived from consumer demand .\n\n\nFor example , General Motor has demand for machinery and parts to\nproduce cars that are more economic and use less petroleum because of the\ndemand consumer have for cars that can save them more money .\n\n\nWhile consumer demand is derived from their own needs and desires .\n\n\n\n Fourthly , the total industry demand for industrial goods is relatively\nunaffected by change in price in short run , compared to the price influence\non demand in the consumer markets .\n\n\nFor example , if all Photostat producers raise the price of each of\ntheir machines by &dollar;1000 to the publishers , this would too little or\nno effect on demand .\n\n\nThe publishers would still purchase roughly the same amount because\nthese &dollar;1000 only represent such a small amount in the overall\nproduction cost of books .\n\n\nBut , on the other hand , this &dollar;1000 increase in price in\nPhotostat would cause a significantly decreased in consumer demand .\n\n\nConsumers will then shift from a high-priced seller to a lower one .\n\n\n\n Fifthly , the fluctuation of demand in organizational market is much\ngreater than that of consumer markets .\n\n\nWhen demand for consumer goods is up , and industrial goods are also\nup , organizational buyers will build up the inventories of raw materials .\n\n\nSo when consumer demand is low , organizational will use up the\ninventories and postpone the supplies .\n\n\nSince there are only a few of buyers in organizational market and\nthe demand from each buyer is very large , decrease in the demand from even\nonly one buyer will lead to a large fluctuation in total demand .\n\n\nIn consumer market , the fluctuation of demand is very small .\n\n\nThe decrease in demand from hundreds of thousands of consumers would\nonly cause a very little decrease in the total demand as there is a lot of\nconsumers in the market . \n\n\n Finally , organizational markets may be either vertical or horizontal .\n\n\nIn a vertical market , the products or services would be sold to\nvirtually all organizations in perhaps one or two industries .\n\n\nWhile in horizontal market are those which are very board , in which\nthe products or services are sold to a wide spectrum of industries .\n\n\nThere are no such markets in consumer markets . \n\n\n Another aspect that differentiates consumer buyer from organizational\nbuyer behavior is the buyer characteristics .\n\n\nFor organizational buying , a group of individual may be involved in\nthe buying-decision making process because the products purchased are very\ncomplex and costly .\n\n\nIf a company is going to purchase a package of large machinery ,\npeople from engineering , production department , finance and purchasing may\ninvolve in the decision making process .\n\n\nEach of them exerts influence on the final decision .\n\n\nBut , for consumer buying , individuals make purchase decision with\nno or little influence from others .\n\n\nMoreover , in organizational buying , professional buyers need to\nhave knowledge about the product being bought and , sometimes , technically\ncompetent individual such as engineers are involved in making decision .\n\n\nThere is no need to involved professionals or technically competent\nindividuals in consumer buying process even consumer are going to buy\nhigh-tech equipment , like hi-fi set .\n\n\nIt is because the information from salespeople or booklet is rich\nenough for consumer reference . \n\n\n Organizational buyers are often strongly directed by  rational\nmotivations  .\n\n\nThey often give weights to different vendors according to some\ncriteria like product quality and consistency , prompt delivery assurance ,\nprice , credit terms , warranty and service .\n\n\nThe one that is higher in weights will be mostly to be chosen .\n\n\nBuyers are not only directed by rational motivation but also \nemotional motivation  .\n\n\nThey may have likes and dislike for vendor salespeople .\n\n\nThis will also affect their buying behavior .\n\n\nJust like organizational buyers , consumer buyers are also directed\nby rational and emotional motivations but in different extend .\n\n\nEmotional motivation is much more influential than rational for\nconsumer buyers .\n\n\nIf the buyer does not like a particular salesperson or vendor , he\nwill probably not shop at that shop .\n\n\nBut , for organizational buyers , They have more interest in what\nsalespeople have to sell and less interest in their personality . \n\n\n The final aspect is the decision process and buying patterns .\n\n\nMuch organizational buyer behavior is typified by greater formality\nthan consumer one .\n\n\nThere are a lot of procedures and policies that must be followed by\nthe organizational buyers .\n\n\nProposals or contracts are involved in the buying process .\n\n\nAlthough consumer may sometimes obtain written price or product\nquotes , this is rare , in contrast to the normally precise and formal\nprocesses used among organizational buyers .\n\n\nMoreover , since the products that organizational buyer going to buy\nare complex and costly , decision making process become much complicated and\nextensive negotiations are required .\n\n\nAlso , the organizational buyers look for many suppliers to avoid\nunforeseen risk and ensure the supply of goods because of the large order\nthey placed .\n\n\nThey purchase directly and infrequently from the suppliers .\n\n\nThe situation for consumer buyers is different .\n\n\nConsumer buyers would like to buy goods from a single source because\nthey expect that they can obtain free goods or discount by purchasing certain\namount of goods at the same time .\n\n\nAlso , they do not need to worry about the supply of goods as the\norder they placed is very small compared with the organizational buyers .\n\n\nLittle negotiation is taken placed for consumer buying . \n\n\n During the decision making process , both the organizational and consumer\nbuyers are influenced by different factors .\n\n\nFor organizational buyer , there are four categories of influences\n :\n\n\n( 1 ) Environmental &swungdash; physical ,\ntechnological , economic , political , legal , ethical , cultural &semi;\n\n\n( 2 ) Organizational &swungdash; tasks , structure ,\ntechnology , people &semi;\n\n\n( 3 ) Interpersonal &swungdash; the buying center ,\nbuying center roles , power relationships &semi;\n\n\n( 4 ) Individual &swungdash; motivation , perception ,\nlearning . \n\n\nWhile for consumer buyers , there are two main factors : \n\n\n( 1 ) External &swungdash; cultural , sub-cultural ,\nsocial class and group , family , personality &semi;\n\n\n( 2 ) Individual &swungdash; information process ,\nlearning and memory , personality and self-concept , attitude , motivation\nand involvement . \n\n\nWe can see that the environment for organizational buyers is more\ncomplicated . \n\n\n Also , when we examine the decision making process of both buyers , we\ncan find that the process made by organizational buyers is more complex than\nconsumer buyers .\n\n\nThe process involved for organizational buyer  ' s are in the\nfollowing sequence :  problem recognition , needs description , product\nspecification , vendor search , proposal request , vendor selection ,\npurchase routine selection and post purchase evaluation  .\n\n\nFor consumer buyers , the sequence is  : problem recognition ,\ninformation recognition and evaluation , purchase processes and post purchase\nbehavior .  \n\n\n We can see that the overall behavior of organizational buyers is more\ncomplex than consumer buyers .\n\n\nTherefore , it needs to separate the study of these two buyer  ' s\nbehavior .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

\n\n \n\n\" If we depart from this core , the country will be ruined\nand the people will be hit with damages . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe party mouthpiece said the country must lose no time in\ndeepening reform and opening the door wider . \n\n \n\n\" The room for reform is still very large , and the tasks of\nreform very heavy , &rdquo; it said . \n\n \n\nThe paper pointed to the need to promote ideological\nindoctrination and party construction , but made no mention of the crusade\nagainst \" peaceful evolution &rdquo; . \n\n \n\nChina analysts said the editorial reflected patriarch Mr Deng\nXiaoping  ' s instructions about down-playing class struggle and concentrating\non economic progress . \n\n \n\nIn his message , Mr Yang alluded to chaotic conditions in the\nformer Soviet Union and in many Eastern European countries when he pleaded\nfor political stability . \n\n \n\n\" Historical facts show that no country in the world has\never succeeded in reforms while the society is in turmoil , &rdquo; he said .\n\n\n \n\nMr Yang , considered an ally of Mr Deng  ' s , said he wanted to\nassure \" foreign friends &rdquo; that there was no foundation for\ndoubting that Beijing would continue with its reforms . \n\n \n\nThe President promised that China would \" accelerate the\npace of carrying out reforms and opening to the outside world &rdquo; . \n\n \n\n\" Reform and the open policy have brought about tremendous\nprogress and development in China , and there is no reason for China to stop\ncarrying them out , &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\nAnalysts said it was significant that Mr Yang did not make any\nreference to leftist goals such as stemming \" bourgeois liberalisation\n&rdquo; . \n\n \n\nMeanwhile , the Chinese media has continued its attack on the\n\" mess &rdquo; brought about by radical reforms initiated by former\nSoviet president Mr Mikhail Gorbachev . \n\n \n\nIn a critical year-end analysis on the former Soviet Union , the\n People  ' s Daily  quoted foreign observers as saying that the Soviet\nUnion  ' s dissolution was \" a tragedy &rdquo; and that the problems\nthere might take many years to resolve .  \n\n \n\n\n Christians urged to help build socialism  \n\n \n\nTHE Fifth National Conference on Christianity has opened in\nBeijing with a call to members of the state-affiliated Protestant churches to\nmake contributions to socialist construction . \n\n \n\nAnd the semi-official China News Service has characterised as a\n\" fabrication &rdquo; a report by a Western news agency that Catholic\npriest Father Li Zhenrong of Cangzhou , Hebei province , has been arrested .\n\n\n \n\nThe seven-day conference was organised by the\ngovernment-sanctioned China Christian Council ( CCC ) and its\ntwin body , the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of Protestant\nChurches ( TSPM ) . \n\n \n\nTSPM vice-president Mr Shen Derong said yesterday Christian\nactivities had vastly expanded . \n\n \n\nThere were now almost five million converts , and the number of\nchurches had grown from about 4,000 in 1986 to more than 7,000 . \n\n \n\nMr Shen called on Christians to \" love their country and\ntheir religion &rdquo; by making contributions to socialist construction .\n\n\n \n\nHe said many Christians had been selected as \" model\nworkers &rdquo; and \" advanced figures &rdquo; in their work units .\n\n\nThe conference was chaired by Bishop Ding Guangxun , who is chief of\nthe CCC and the TSPM . \n\n \n\nChinese sources said following Beijing  ' s call to heighten\nvigilance against \" foreign infiltration through religion &rdquo; , the\npatriotic churches had tried to ensure that their members abided by the\nsocialist ethos . \n\n \n\nCrackdowns on illegal house churches , which claim more than 40\nmillion affiliates , have been stepped up . \n\n \n\nBishop Ding , who disapproved of the June 4 crackdown , has\nlargely kept a low profile in the past two years . \n\n \n\nIn other developments the China News Service said in a dispatch\nlast night , that Father Li Zhenrong was in hospital for cancer treatment in\nTianjin and had not been detained by police . \n\n \n\nThe agency also denied foreign press reports that Beijing had\nclamped down on Christmas celebrations . \n\n\n -;

in the\ncountry . \n\n \n\nIn an unusually frank appraisal of the socio-economic situation ,\nMr Jiang called for a full scale campaign to cool down the economy . \n\n \n\nMr Jiang  ' s latest instructions , which have been interpreted as\nan indirect critique of Mr Deng  ' s views , will be published in this month  ' s\nissue of the Chinese-funded Hongkong magazine,  Bauhinia  . \n\n \n\n\" The central authorities have raised ( the slogan\nof ) preventing the economy from overheating in order to avert major\nupheavals and major losses , \" said Mr Jiang , who nonetheless admitted\nthat \" small-scale shocks are inevitable &rdquo; . \n\n \n\nReferring to the excessively ambitious goals of the regions , Mr\nJiang said : \" Economic development must be based on objective reality .\n\n\nPlaces which have the qualifications can go as fast as they like .\n\n\nThose that do not yet have the qualifications should not force\nthemselves . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nHe added that a \" relative high speed of development\n&rdquo; must be achieved in tandem with a \" rational economic structure\n&rdquo; and with a balanced growth between various geographical and economic\nsectors . \n\n \n\nMr Jiang cited three problems . \n\n \n\nFirst , he said , efforts must be made to crack down on\ncorruption , especially the phenomenon of \" exchanging power for money\n&rdquo; . \n\n \n\nSecond , income disparity between the coast and the hinterland ,\nand that between the rich and the poor , must be narrowed . \n\n \n\nThird , Mr Jiang indicated , inflation must be tamed , and\nadequate levels of prices , interest rates and foreign exchange rates must be\nsought . \n\n \n\nIn an apparent reference to Mr Deng  ' s four-month-old dictum\nabout \" seizing the opportunities &rdquo;

a source said . \n\n \n\n\" For example , he has helped Jiang Zemin draft documents ,\nincluding the Political Report of the 14th Party Congress last October .\n&rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe source said given the expanding clout of Mr Jiang , Mr Liu\ncould continue to rise . \n\n \n\nHe added Mr Jiang had originally wanted to make Mr Liu a\nvice-head of the Central Committee  ' s Propaganda Department . \n\n \n\nIt is understood that last February , Mr Liu undertook a secret\nmission on Mr Jiang  ' s behalf to the United States . \n\n \n\nThere , Mr Liu sounded out several dissidents and former Chinese\nofficials on the possibility of their return to China to work for the General\nSecretary . \n\n \n\nChinese intellectuals who have worked with Mr Liu described him\nas an \" efficient pragmatist &rdquo;

{"text": "On the Requirements of Designated Refuge Floors in High-rise\nBuildings   \n\n\n Abstract:  \n\n \n\nIn the recent decade , high-rise/ultra high-rise buildings have\nbeen erected throughout Hong Kong Fire safety of the occupants in these\nbuildings is one of the major concern of building designers .\n\n\nAn evacuation system is not the first step of fire safety design in\nbuildings , yet it cannot be eliminated , as a hazard free environment cannot\nbe provided .\n\n\nIn relation to the escape from high-rise buildings , the introduction\nof designated refuge floors has been stipulated in the newly published Code\nof Practice on Means of Escape of Hong Kong .\n\n\nSuch requirement has a major influence on the design of high-rise\nbuildings , yet its usefulness is not fully explored .\n\n\nThis paper discusses on the conceptual idea of using designated refuge\nfloor and introduces some ongoing research areas.  \n\n\n Introduction  \n\n \n\nIn view of the growth of population , changes in family structure\n, and an increase in business activities , the demand for built space in Hong\nKong has grown rapidly in the past two decades .\n\n\nNumerous high-rise or ultra high-rise buildings  have\nbeen erected .\n\n\nOffice , commercial and private residential buildings erected in the\nrecent decade are commonly over 40 storeys .\n\n\nThis implies that a large number of people in Hong Kong live and work\nat a high level .\n\n\nThere is no doubt that the government authorities , the building\ndesigners as well as the people of Hong Kong are concerned for the safety of\nthe occupants inside these buildings especially under fire or emergency\nsituations .\n\n\nIn relation to the escape from high-rise buildings , the Hong Kong\nGovernment has stipulated in the Code of Practice on Means of Escape (  1 ) \nthat designated refuge floors should be provided in some of these buildings .\n\n\nThe provision of an area for refuge is not a new concept .\n\n\nFor example , in the NFPA101 Life safety Code (  2 ) , the functions of\nareas of refuge are expressed as to improved the usability of means of egress\nfor some occupants of the building , and to provide greater flexibility in\nthe provision of means of egress .\n\n\nHowever , the requirement to designated a complete floor for refuge\npurpose is apparently not included in the fire codes of most developed\ncountries .\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThis paper provides a discussion on the use of designated refuge\nfloor taking into account the views from different parties .\n\n\nIn addition , a brief introduction about the author  ' s ongoing\nresearch works related to this aspect is given  . \n\n\n Backgrounds  \n\n \n\nFire safety design in building is one of the major aspects that\nshould be scrutinized by the Building authority prior to approval of general\nbuilding plans .\n\n\nThe fire safety design is mainly governed by the prescriptive codes\nof practices published by the Buildings Department and the Fire\nServices Department . \n\n \n\nOf all the fire codes , the Code of Practice on Means of Escape\nwas the first published and came 9into operation of 1st January 1960 .\n\n\nIt provides guidance for the design of the sizes and capacities of\nvarious building elements in respect to evacuation purpose .\n\n\nAlthough some minor amendments have been added to the code over the\nintervening years , the majority of the requirements have not been updated\nsince its first publication .\n\n\nIn 1990 , the Hong Kong Government decided to update the requirements\nin the code and a working party on the review of the Code of Practice on\nMeans of Escape was established .\n\n\nSubsequent to the extensive consultation , the new edition of the\ncode of practice was published in late 1996 .\n\n\nOne of the contentious requirements in the new code is the provision\nof designated refuge floor(s ) in high-rise buildings.  \n\n\n Some Regulators ' View on the use of Refuge Floors  \n\n \n\nIn the code , a refuge floor is considered as part of the exit\nroute in buildings .\n\n\nIt acts as a safe place for a short rest before people continue to\nescape downwards as it is difficult for most people to walk down a tall\nbuilding without pausing (  5 ) .\n\n\nIt also acts as a safe passage for people using one staircase , when\nencountering smoke , fire or obstruction in that staircase and enables them\nto proceed to an alternative staircase .\n\n\nAdditionally , it acts as a place of assembly for people to wait for\nrescue in case none of the staircases can be used due to smoke , fire or\nobstruction. \n\n \n\nObviously , the refuge floor is considered as a temporary safe\nplace for the evacuees under fire situations .\n\n\nIt is a placed adopted temporarily to reduce the effective \"\ntravelling height &rdquo; of the evacuees .\n\n\nThe major functions of a refuge floor are: \n\n \n\ni ) acting as a relief area for the evacuees under fire\nsituations; ii ) acting as a subbase for firefighting purpose; iii ) acting as\na command point by the rescue personnel to assist orderly evacuation of the\nbuilding; and iv ) acting as a place allowing the disable or partially\ndisabled to wait for assistance before being evacuate to a place of ultimate\nsafety . \n\n \n\nThe prime principle of life safety from fire in a building is\nthat there should be a minimum of two staircases for the occupants to leave\nin order to ensure that at least one exit route is available at all times .\n\n\nHowever , there may still be the chance that all the staircases are\nblocked off .\n\n\nFor example , in summer , 1995 , a fire occurred in a 10-storey\nresidential/commercial building in North Point , Hong Kong .\n\n\nAll the staircases were blocked by smoke before all the occupants had\nleft the building .\n\n\nUnder these circumstances about 30 to 40 evacuees escaped to the roof\nto await rescue (  6 ) .\n\n\nIn this case , the roof served as a refuge area and eventually all\nthe people were rescued .\n\n\nHowever , in some buildings , not all the staircases may lead to the\nroof and in some modern buildings , the roof forms may be either covered or\npitched .\n\n\nIn such buildings , if all the staircases were blocked by fire , the\noccupants ' lives would be at risk and refuge floors offer a safe alternative.\n \n\n\n The Criteria in a Achieving the Objectives  \n\n \n\nIt has been mentioned (  7 ) that evacuees will normally experience\nfatigue while travelling in a downward direction after approaching nearly\nabout 5 minutes (  i.e .\n\n\nabout 300 seconds ) and 1 minute in an upward direction .\n\n\nThe average speed of the evacuees ' travel down one storey with normal\nheadroom of 2.8m per floor is about 16 seconds (  8 ) .\n\n\nIn this connection , the fatigue will be in when the evacuees have\ntravelled about 18 storeys downward .\n\n\nBased on this aspect , if the refuge floor is adopted as a \"\nrest place\" , then the logical location of refuge floors is at about 18\nstorey intervals .\n\n\nBy allowing some deviation in storey height for different buildings\nand for different rate of movement of people , the Hong Kong  ' s new code (  1 ) \nhas stated that refuge floors should be provided in all buildings exceeding\n25 storeys at intervals of 20 storeys to 25 storeys. \n\n \n\nTo perform these functions well , a refuge floor should be a safe\nand comfortable place to stay in order to reduce the stress level of the\nevacuees during escape .\n\n\nIt should have sufficient area to accommodate most of the occupants\nwho are expected to temporarily halt at the floor (  5 ) .\n\n\nIt should have adequate headroom , lighting , ventilation as well as\nguidance signage .\n\n\nAs the refuge floor is considered a temporary safe place , it should\nhave sufficient fire resisting properties (  2 hours Fire Resisting Period)\nand adequate ventilation to prevent the retention of smoke (  the area for\nrefuge should be open-sided on at least two sides to provide adequate cross\nventilation ) (  1 ) . \n\n \n\nThe design and layout of exit staircases requires evacuees to\ndischarge into the refuge floor before being permitted to proceed downwards .\n\n\nBy this method , the control of the evacuation process may be\ninstituted at every refuge floor .\n\n\nThe process can be illustrated by Figure 1. \n\n \n\nAs water that may accumulate on a refuge floor will affect the\nsafety use of the area for refuge , a refuge floor should be suitably\nwaterproof and drained.  \n\n \n\nThe refuge floor mentioned above is considered as part of the\nexit system .\n\n\nIt serves as an interim rest place for the people under evacuation\nand therefore , it is important to ensure that the area is free from\nobstructions with well-maintained signage and lighting .\n\n\nGood management therefore plays an essential role in maintaining the\nfunction of a refuge floor. \n\n \n\nAdequate stimulating features , such as signage , should be\nprovided at appropriate locations to assist in the wayfinding process .\n\n\nAt the point of discharge and re-entry into exits , interactive\nemergency signs and voice communication methods may be used to direct\nevacuees (  5 ) .  \n\n\n The Psychological Reaction of People  \n\n \n\nApart from the points discussed above , the psychological effect\nof using refuge floor should need to consider as evacuation process involves\npeople  ' s behavioral reactions .\n\n\nThe use of a refuge floor may psychologically assist the people under\nevacuation process as this action involves a spatial problem solving process\n[ 9 ) .\n\n\nCognitive mapping plays a central role in the people  ' s ability to\nsolve spatial problem (  10 ) .\n\n\nThe refuge floor that has been stored as an image within the users'\ncognitive map can influence the movement of the individual .\n\n\nThis cognitive map will be built up by rehearsed fire drills that are\nconsidered essential in any properly managed high-rise building .\n\n\nThis familiarity will encourage the users to approach the focal point\n- the refuge floor and organize their way to leave the building in a rational\nand controlled manner. \n\n \n\nUnder emergency situations , the people will experience\nenvironmental stress .\n\n\nThere are three types of personal control , namely behavioral control\n, cognitive control and decisional control that people can exert over\nthreatening circumstances (  11 ) .\n\n\nThe behavioral control refers to actions that can directly modify the\nthreatening event such as extinguishing the fire .\n\n\nCognitive control refers to the way an individual interprets the\nthreatening event .\n\n\nThe presence of refuge floor can reassure users that the height of\ntheir escape is not extensive .\n\n\nThe refuge floor serves as an image of safe place .\n\n\nThe decisional control is defined in terms of the range of choices\navailable to an individual .\n\n\nDuring evacuation from the highest floors of an ultra high-rise\nbuilding , the refuge floor can serve as an intermediate point where the\nevacuees can have the choice of taking a rest , waiting for rescue or\ncontinuing the escape .\n\n\nObviously , the refuge floor can psychologically assist the evacuees\nin reducing their stress during evacuation by offering cognitive and\ndecisional control. \n\n \n\nThe refuge floor can serve as a basis for the firemen to fight\nthe fire .\n\n\nOnce people have reached a refuge floor and see fire fighters there ,\nthey will be psychologically relieved and more confident of their personal\nsafety .\n\n\nIt may be due to the fact that a firefighter is in general a sign of\nsafety in an evacuee  ' s cognitive image .\n\n\nThe primary concept of refuge floors is to provide a place for a\nbreak and to release the people  ' s stress when they proceed down to the\nultimate place of safety.  \n\n \n\nMoreover , at the refuge floor , passenger lifts not serving the\nfire floor can , with the assistance of fire fighters , also be used for\npeople evacuating from the refuge floors .\n\n\nOne of the arguments of not using lift for evacuation is that it is\ndifficult to control the crowd movement if most of the people are under\nstress .\n\n\nPsychologically , the stress of the people at the refuge floor may be\nreduced .\n\n\nIt may be feasible for the rescue personnel to control the evacuation\nprocess by using lifts .\n\n\nThis is particularly important where the elderly , children or\nhandicapped users are involved in the evacuation process. \n\n \n\nIn order to \" reinforce &rdquo; the image of refuge floors\nin the cognitive maps of the evacuees , the users of the building should be\ninformed that the existence of refuge floors in the building .\n\n\nA plan showing the relative locations of refuge floors should be\nplaced in a conspicuous part of the building such as at the main lift lobby .\n\n\nIn addition , the general public should be educated that refuge\nfloors are provided in high-rise/ ' ultra high-rise buildings and they are\nused as temporary safe places .\n\n\nIf such ideas have been formulated in people  ' s minds , the stress\nlevel of those people situated at extremely high levels may be reduced .\n\n\nStaff training , the establishment of contingency planning and fire\ndrills can be adopted to reinforce the refuge floor image.  \n\n\n Some Arguments  \n\n \n\nThe use of refuge floors in high-rise buildings as introduced by\nthe new Hong Kong code was questioned by the construction professionals in\nthat: \n\n \n\ni ) Corridors and staircases are the protected routes of an exit\nsystem .\n\n\nThese components are adequate to guide the evacuees to leave the\nbuilding and an interim safe place may lead to \" extended travel\n&rdquo; and seems unnecessary .\n\n\nii ) The fatigue that happens for some evacuees under extended travel\nin staircases may not create too much of a problem unless the density inside\nthe staircase is so high that obstruction occurs .\n\n\niii ) It is doubtful whether the evacuees will stay in the refuge\nfloor and await rescue .\n\n\nThe refuge floor seems merely useful for those who find difficulty\nin escape .  \n\n\n Discussion on the Arguments  \n\n \n\nTravel in the protected routes may not be arduous if the\nbuilding is not substantially high .\n\n\nIn buildings over 40 storeys , which are commonly found in Hong Kong\n, evacuees ' travel time by moving continuously from the topmost floor to the\nground level may require 10 to 12 minutes .\n\n\nIntermediate rest appears necessary for most people .\n\n\nIf the staircase is crowded , such an obstruction may create a\nhazard to the evacuees as well as increasing the evacuation time of the\npeople inside the building .\n\n\nIn Hong Kong , most commercial buildings are densely populated and\nwith these high populations , it may be particularly necessary to designate a\nplace for refuge in those densely populated commercial buildings .\n\n\nNevertheless , a detail study on the effectiveness of refuge floor\nwith respect to the density of the building may be worth carrying out. \n\n \n\nIn residential buildings , the population density is not as high .\n\n\nBut , the pre-evacuation time may be very long , especially when\nmost of the occupants are asleep .\n\n\nThe possibility that smoke or fire blocks all the staircases in the\npre-evacuation period may be higher .\n\n\nRefuge floors may then be necessary to serve as a temporary safe\nplace in the escape process.  \n\n \n\nThe refuge floor is not primarily designed as a place for\nevacuees to remain and await for rescue but it may have to perform this role\nif all the escape routes below are blocked .\n\n\nNormally , it should be regarded as a buffer zone to assist the\nmovement of the people in ultra high-rise buildings .\n\n\nA dependency on emergency management for effective evacuation of\noccupants from ultra high-rise buildings is always a problem .\n\n\nThus , a concept where such dependency may be reduced should merit\nserious consideration (  12 ) .\n\n\nRefuge floors that serve as zones to reduce the effective height of\na building can help engender phased evacuation and to simplify these\nprocesses. \n\n \n\nIf the fire doors of the staircase core are opened , smoke is\nable to migrate to the staircase .\n\n\nThe refuge floor can be adopted to segregate the staircases into\nsegments (  see figure 1 ) in order to prevent total smoke logging throughout\nthe entire staircase. \n\n \n\nApart from the arguments mentioned above , the introduction of\nrefuge floors can cause other problems .\n\n\nMaintaining the effectiveness of refuge floors may not be a simple\nmatter .\n\n\nIn view of the huge demand for floor space , unauthorized building\nworks and unauthorized changes of use in buildings which can provide readily\navailable floor space have always been a problem in Hong Kong and in most\nAsian countries (  13 ) .\n\n\nRefuge floors are readily available spaces that could be misused .\n\n\nFrom a management point of view , a refuge area that is an extended\nportion of the exit route will be easier to manage than a complete floor\ndedicated to refuge purposes .\n\n\nHowever , from a psychological point of view , the image of an\nextended portion of exit route may not be as effective as a complete refuge\nfloor .\n\n\nThe benefits of using refuge floors to release the psychological\nstress of the evacuees may be taken in account. \n\n \n\nThe regulators recognize the importance of good maintenance in\nthe introduction of refuge floors .\n\n\nIn the commentary accompanying the code (  5 ) , the building\nmanagement in relation to the use of refuge floors has been spelt out .\n\n\nIn order to maintain a clear and unobstructed refuge floor ,\neffective statutory control should be considered .\n\n\nThe relevant authorities have the duty to carry out regular\ninspections of the refuge floors , which is regarded as part of the exit\nroute .\n\n\nIf an obstruction is noted , a \" fire hazard abatement notice\n&rdquo; (  under the Fire Services Ordinance ) or an \" illegal structure\nremoval notice &rdquo; (  Under the Buildings Ordinance ) may be served to\ncause the obstructions to be removed .\n\n\nHowever , such approaches can only be regarded as passive means of\ncontrol .\n\n\nIn practice , its effectiveness should be questioned .\n\n\nA more positive approach could be the adoption of a certification\nsystem to ensure the efficiency of the refuge floors .\n\n\nThe owners of the building would be required to produce a\ncertificate issued by recognized persons or bodies annually (  or within a\nreasonable period of time ) to demonstrate the efficiency of the refuge floors .\n\n\nHowever , such arrangement may need amendment to current\nlegislation. \n\n \n\nApart form the managerial problems , the use of refuge floors\nmay increase the cost of construction especially where a complete floor for\nrefuge purposes is incorporated into cross-wall construction as is commonly\nfound in high-rise residential blocks .\n\n\nThe new code takes into account of this in its provision for\npermitting part of the refuge floor to be used for building services (  with\nadequate fire separation ) and this permits staged pumping , for example , and\nother utilities at intermediate levels of the building .\n\n\nNevertheless , the cost implication for the provision of refuge\nfloor may need to be studied against its usefulness. \n\n \n\nThe effectiveness of refuge floor under fire situations may be\nimpaired if the floor is affected by smoke from lower levels .\n\n\nThe current requirements for cross ventilation may not guarantee\nthat smoke logging will not occur particularly under adverse weather\nconditions .\n\n\nFurther studies with respect to this aspect are necessary.  \n\n\n Some Ongoing Research works  \n\n \n\nThere exist some merits of using refuge floors , yet the\neffectiveness of refuge floors under fire situations has not been fully\nexplored .\n\n\nThe effectiveness of refuge floor may be impaired if the floor is\naffected by smoke from other levels .\n\n\nSmoke is one of the major causes of fatalities in fire and the\nrequirements for cross ventilation in the code cannot guarantee that smoke\nlogging will not occur particularly under adverse weather conditions. \n\n \n\nDespite the importance of the smoke effect on refuge floors ,\nthe effort devoted by the professionals to study the adequacy of refuge floor\ndesign is scarce .\n\n\nPerhaps , this may be due to the fact that many building codes in\nthe world do not prescriptively require the provision of designated refuge\nfloor .\n\n\nIn fact , the existing methods , recommendations and guidelines on\nthe design of smoke control systems did not address specifically to the\nrefuge floor design (  14-20 ) . \n\n \n\nApart from the smoke effect on refuge floor , the evacuation\npattern of occupants inside high-rise buildings with refuge floor should also\nbe a major area of study. \n\n \n\nRecently , the author has successfully obtained research grants\nfrom City University and Universities Research Grant Council to commence some\nstudies: \n\n \n\nthe movement of smoke in buildings in relation to different\ndesigns parameters of refuge floors , orientation of the buildings ,\nstaircases and other environmental factors such as weather using both the\ncomputational and experimental modelling techniques; the hazardous effects\nof the smoke to the evacuees in refuge floors; the effect of refuge floor\nwith respect to the evacuation pattern; and the requirements with respect\nto the codification of the refuge floors in Hong Kong . \n\n \n\nIn studying the smoke movement pattern , it is recognized that\nwind flows around buildings have significant effect on the smoke movement\naround and inside buildings .\n\n\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (  CFD ) technique has been developed\nrapidly over the last decade to evaluate the interaction between wind and\nbuildings numerically .\n\n\nHowever , the evaluation of wind-building-smoke movement interaction\nby CFD has received relatively little , if any , attention in the literature\nin the past .\n\n\nIn City University of HK , the numerical prediction of wind flows\naround three-dimensional buildings has been studied for several years .\n\n\nA computer program-WIND 3D which includes solving the time-averaged\nNovier-stokes equations with the standard kai turbulence model by using\nthe finite difference technique has been developed (  21 , 22 ) .\n\n\nWIND 3D can be used to calculate flows over single or groups of\nbuildings and over flat terrain or uneven terrain , and to predict mean and\nfluctuating pressures , turbulence quantities , loads and vibrations for\ndifferent wind directions .\n\n\nIt is going to extend the model to predict smoke movement under\ndifferent weather conditions and to carry out parametric studies on refuge\nfloor design. \n\n \n\nRefuge floor is considered as part of exit system .\n\n\nThe prescriptive requirements of refuge floor design appear to be\nbased on intuitive judgement and/ or simple derivation on the basis of\nmechanical flows of evacuees .\n\n\nDevelopment of a comprehensive evacuation model can help to analyze\nthe effectiveness of the prescriptive rules and assist the establishment of\nefficient escape strategy including the use of lifts for evacuation .\n\n\nA system evacuation model on the basis of state space modelling\ntechnique is going to develop .\n\n\nIt is expected that the effectiveness of refuge floor on different\ntypes of buildings may be studied.  \n\n\n Concluding Remarks  \n\n \n\nThe refuge floor concept may facilitate the evacuation process\nin ultra high-rise buildings .\n\n\nIt appears that its image can help to release the stress of the\nevacuees .\n\n\nIt serves as a buffer zone and simplify the evacuation process\nwhilst acting as a basepoint for the firefighters and rescue personnel to\ninitiate escape by using lifts. \n\n \n\nThe provision of refuge is a prescriptive requirement in the\nCode of Practice .\n\n\nSuch a provision appears to be desirable by the regulators as it\nrelates to simple rules and has administrative convenience .\n\n\nIn order to explore the effectiveness of using refuge floor ,\ncomprehensive studies and long-term monitoring in all aspects including\ntechnical , social and economic aspects should be carried out .\n\n\nThe author has started to carry out some studies and results will be\npublished in coming articles.", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "fb03c4c9-17da-4fa1-9b30-9007b07789df", "added":

{"text": "Stitching together the longest bridge structure in Hong Kong \n \n\n\nBy Angela Tam \n\n \n\nOn December 13 , 2001 , the last of 8,775 viaduct segments was put\nin place on West Rail , marking the completion of 9.8 km of viaducts in a\nrecord 30 months .\n\n\nWhen other sections being constructed under different station\ncontracts are also completed , the West Rail viaducts will total 13.4 km in\nlength , making it the longest bridge structure in Hong Kong . \n\n \n\nSeveral factors account for the length of viaducts on the 30.5 km\nlong West Rail Phase I , including the presence of river courses , footpaths\n, roads , communities and more importantly the flood plains in the North West\nNew Territories . \n\n \n\n\" We chose the viaduct option because that way we won't\nsever local communities and we can maintain free passage between columns for\nriver courses , roads and footpaths , &rdquo; said Kowloon-Canton Railway\nCorporation  ' s (  KCRC ) Director of West Rail , Ir Ian Thoms .\n\n\n\" Also , West Rail crosses an alluvial plain that is susceptible\nto flooding .\n\n\nWe did consider embankments for part of the way , but embankments\noccupy a large footprint so they  ' re not so environmentally friendly , and\nthey don't allow passage of people . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nApart from the maximum railway gradient of 3% , the height\nof the viaduct was determined by such factors as water level during the wet\nseason and track configuration .\n\n\nAt Siu Hong Station , for example , the track is at the first level\nwith the concourse above it , but at Tuen Mun station it is the other way\nround . \n\n \n\nKCRC split the main portion of the viaducts into two contracts\nconsisting of a 5.5km section between Kam Tim and Tin Shui Wai and Siu Hong\nrespectively .\n\n\nIn the event , the Maeda-Chun Wo Joint Venture (  Viaduct ) overcame\nthe opposition and won both contracts , which totaled HK&dollar;2.12 billion\nin value .\n\n\nWork commenced in July 1999 .  \n\n \n\nSince in situ construction would have been noisy , disruptive and\nslow , precast segmental construction was prescribed in the design from the\noutset .\n\n\nNevertheless , an alternative design was proposed and accepted ,\nresulting in substantial savings for the West Rail project . \n\n \n\nUnder the conforming design , the load of the box girders would\nbe transferred to circular piers via a pier head roughly in the shape of an\ninverted pyramid .\n\n\nUnder the alternative design developed by Robert Benaim Assoicates ,\nhowever , each pier segment was placed directly on top of its own pier .\n\n\nHaving the webs directly under the tracks allowed the box sections to\nbe slimmed down while re-radiation noise was also reduced .\n\n\nAbout 27% of the concrete required under the conforming\ndesign was thus saved .\n\n\nAt the same time , the monolithic connections eliminated the need for\nbearings , thus saving more on bearings , thus saving more on construction\ncosts as well as future maintenance costs . \n\n \n\nThe segments were precast in Little Montana in Zhuhai , near\nMacau , prior to the enclave  ' s handover in December 1999 .\n\n\nThe precasting sub-contractor later moved to Dongguan to complete its\nwork . \n\n \n\nTwenty-eight moulds were used to match-cast three main types of\nsegments , with 18 used for span segments , six for pier segments and four\nfor cantilever segments .     \n\n\nThree ways to build a viaduct  \n\n \n\nDeck erection began in May 2000 .\n\n\nAccording to the KCRC , the initial approach was to utilize overhead\nlaunching girders because it would be able to cater for the three structural\nsystems present on the viaduct as well as the small wing cantilevers of the\nsegments in the conforming design .\n\n\nHowever , with the adoption of the alternative design , which\nfeatured deeper segments with wider wings , underslung launching systems\nentered the picture . \n\n \n\nThe majority of segments were placed using Types II underslung\nlaunching girders measuring 85m in length each .\n\n\nThe self-launching system consisted of twin plate girders , one below\neach wing of the segments .\n\n\nSegments were crane-loaded into the girders and taken to their\napproximate position by trolleys with hydraulic jacks used to support the\nsegments and adjust their alignment .\n\n\nThe segments were glued and primarily stressed once all the segments\nin a span had been loaded .\n\n\nPrecast parapets were then installed before secondary post-tensioning\nwas applied and the dead load transferred to hydraulic jacks on the pier .\n\n\nOnce this had been achieved , the girders were lowered and slid\nforward by a chain drive system for placement of the next span . \n\n \n\nThe initial progress rate was six days per span , from setting up\nthe girder to loading on the segments and buttering up the faces .\n\n\nOnce the learning curve was overcome , the progress rate improved ,\nonce to four days per span .\n\n\nWith each span measuring an average of 35m between piers , that would\nbe close to 70m of viaduct in a little over a week . \n\n \n\nFor the crossover areas at Kam Tin and Tin Shui Wai , the deck\nerection specialist sub-contractor , VSL , developed a Type I girder\nconsisting of a series of removable module that allowed the length of the\ninverted triangle truss to vary from 22m to 40.5m .\n\n\nSupported on needle beams resting in blocked out holes in the piers\nand brackets on top of the portals , the girder was moved forward by a\ncrawler crane .\n\n\nCapable of transverse movement , this girder allowed the placement of\nparallel segments in the crossover areas .\n\n\nA third method of segment erection was also used on West Rail , for\nthe erection of larger spans on about 1km of the viaducts .\n\n\nThe balanced cantilever method involved the placement of segments on\neither side of a pier segment followed by temporary stressing .\n\n\nPermanent post-tensioning was applied after a few pairs of segments\nwere placed .\n\n\nThe process was repeated until a span was competed .\n\n\nThe stitch between adjoining spans were then filled with in-situ\nconcrete .\n\n\nA total of 28 spans were constructed using the balanced cantilever\nmethod .  \n\n \n\nAltogether eight pairs of launching girders were used on this\nproject .   \n\n\nChallenges and solutions  \n\n \n\nThe segments are shaped so that each span forms a portal , a\ndesign which is good for modern railways . \n\n \n\n\" On standard steel plates you have scarf joints to absorb\nthe movement as the rails slide on the face when they expand or contract ,\nbut with continuous welded rail , which gives a smoother ride , you don't\nwant any movement , &rdquo; Ir Thoms explained .\n\n\n\" When you have discrete portals , it means movements in the\nstructure can be taken up y individual portals rather than a system dealing\nwith the movement every 300m or so .\n\n\nThat means we can have continuous floating slab track and don't need\nexpensive movement joints . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe 3.2 m high parapets serve several functions .\n\n\nThey act as noise barriers and are used to carry the overhead lines\nas well as brackets for cabling and a walkway for firemen  ' s access and\nmaintenance .\n\n\nThe width of the aluminium walkway was carefully calculated to ensure\nthat it would confine noise generated by the train  ' s undercarriage without\ninterfering with the train  ' s movement .\n\n\nAccording to Ir Thoms , it was also designed with safety in mind:\nshould a train derail , the walkway will progressively drop away so it will\nnot act as a \" tin opener &rdquo; , furthering damaging the train and\nendangering the lives of passengers .   \n\n \n\nAlthough the parapets can be extended to form a higher noise\nbarrier , KCRC does not want to see the viaduct fully enclosed , both because\nit wants passengers to enjoy natural daylight and because more stringent fire\nstrategy for tunnels would apply if it was fully enclosed .\n\n\nSome sections , however , will be shielded from nearly residential\ntowers by noise barriers . \n\n \n\nThe segments are supported by a total of 1,119 piers founded on\n748 piles of up to 2,500 mm diameter .\n\n\nIn areas in Long Ping that contain marble/pyroclastic breccia ,\nground improvement with pre-grouting before and shaft grouting after pile\ncasting were carried out so that bored piling using bentonite suspension can\nbe employed .\n\n\nWhere piling works were restricted by lack of work space or vibration\nlimits , pre-bored H-piles were used instead of bored piles . \n\n \n\nThe length of the viaduct means that it would inevitably\nencounter a host of facilities whose operation must be maintained throughout\nthe construction period .\n\n\nExamples include a section crossing the Route 3 Country Park Section\nwhere works could only be carried out at night under temporary traffic\narrangements and the erection of protective enclosures where work was carried\nout directly above Light Rail tracks . \n\n \n\nTimely completion of the viaduct was critical sue to the need to\nachieve a number of access dates .\n\n\nThe trackwork contractor has already completed 60 - 70% of\nthe trackwork on the viaducts and other systemwide contractors are proceeding\napace with the track-related installation programme . \n\n \n\nWest Rail is scheduled for completion in December 2003 , but with\nthe overall programme going smoothly , an earlier completion is expected to\nbe achieved .\n\n\nIr Thoms would not reveal any exact date , but signs are that it will\nfall in the third quarter of the same year . \n\n\n  \n\n\nAdditional truck transfer facilities to Kowloon East and water supply\nto Anderson Road quarries   \n\n\nBy Ir H K Wu  \n\n\n Description  \n\n \n\nRapid development in Kowloon East necessitated the construction\nof additional trunk transfer facilities to supplement the water supply to the\narea to cope with growth in water demand .\n\n\nIt was also necessary to construct dedicated fresh water and salt\nwater supply and distribution systems to meet the demand from the new\ndevelopments in the Anderson Road Quarries site , the first stage being at\nthe Po Lam Road platform .\n\n\nIt was forecast in 1995 that the population intake at the new estates\nat Po Lam Road would reach 16,000 by year 2001 . \n\n \n\nThe proposed works for the truck transfer facilities comprised\nthe construction of the Tsui Lam Fresh Water Pumping Station , laying of\napproximately 5 km of 600-1000 mm diameter fresh water trunk mains ,\nmodification of the existing Shun Lee Tsuen Pumping Station and modification\nof the monitoring and control facilities of various service reservoirs .\n\n\nExtension of the water supply systems to the new developments in the\nAnderson Quarries site consisted of construction of the Anderson Road No 2\nFresh Water Service Reservoir and laying of approximately 3 km of 250-600 mm\ndiameter fresh water and salt water distribution mains . \n\n \n\nThe planning , design and supervision of the construction works\nof the project were carried out by the Water Supplies Department (  WSD ) .\n\n\nDetailed design commenced in late 1995 and was completed in mid 1997 .\n\n\n \n\nThe construction work was divided into three main packages: the\nTsui Lam Fresh Water Pumping Station; the Anderson Road No 2 Fresh Water\nService Reservoir; and the mainlaying works .   \n\n\nDesign highlights  \n\n \n\nTo meet the development requirements of the Anderson Road\nQuarries site , a new service reservoir of 15,000 cu m capacity had to be\nconstructed with an invert level at approximately 200 mPD .\n\n\nSuitable locations within reasonable proximity to the quarries site\nwere limited since the quarries themselves would continue to operate . \n\n \n\nA hilly site near the junction of Po Lam Road and Anderson Road\nwas chosen to minimise the length of the local water mains to be laid to\nsupply the Po Lam Road site .\n\n\nThe form and the orientation of the reservoir were carefully designed\nto minimise the visual impact of the completed works on sensitive receivers .\n\n\nTo reduce the amount of excavation involved , it was decided to\nminimise the footprint of the reservoir and to maximise the reservoir height .\n\n\nAs a result , an L-shape was chosen for the reservoir footprint so as\nto blend in with the hilly and sloping terrain .\n\n\nA water retaining height of 9 m was adopted for the reservoir , which\napproached the upper limit for the economic design of cantilever perimeter\nand division walls .\n\n\nThe roof slab was a 225 mm thick flat slab system to be supported on\nthe reservoir walls and 550 mm N&tilde; 550 mm square columns with flared column\nheads at 4,500 mm spacing .  \n\n \n\nLow cost and ease of construction were typical features of\ncantilever wall design in comparison with counterfort wall design .\n\n\nAlthough counterfort walls would have slimmer sections , the\nconstruction cost would be higher due to the higher formwork cost .\n\n\nBesides , due to space constraints , counterfort walls were\nconsidered not suitable , as they would cause obstruction to the construction\nof the ancillary structures around the reservoir .\n\n\nTo tackle the problem of cracking , extra provisions were\nincorporated in the specifications to control the rise of in temperature\nduring concreting and reduce the temperature gradient along the wall section .\n\n\n \n\nSpecial attention was also paid to landscaping and environmental\ncompliance .\n\n\nThe Landscape Unit of the highways Department was invited to carry\nout the landscape design , the intention of which was to mitigate the visual\ndisturbance posed by the reservoir by blending the site with the visual\nlandscape .\n\n\nAll the slopes formed were first covered by hydroseeding .\n\n\nUpon completion of the civil works , planting works were carried out\naccording to the landscape design .\n\n\nScreen planting of native species would also be undertaken along the\nexposed faces of the reservoir . \n\n \n\nThe Tsui Lam Fresh Water Pumping Station was designed as an\nunmanned station for accommodating two different pump groups , namely the\nultra high level and the high level pump groups for supplying the new\nAnderson Road No 2 Fresh Water Service Reservoir and the various secondary\nreservoirs in the Kowloon East areas respectively .\n\n\nVarious design options were considered for accommodating eight\npumpsets in the best configuration within the limited space of the pump hall .\n\n\nThe pumpsets were designed to operate automatically depending on the\nwater levels of the receiving service reservoirs .\n\n\nProvision of manual control of all pumpsets has been made at the\nlocal switchboard and remote control facilities at other pumping stations via\nthe Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System (  SCADA ) have also been\nprovided .    \n\n\nConstruction highlights    \n\n\nAnderson Road No 2 Service Reservoir  \n\n \n\nThe fist challenge for the construction team was to make an\naccess to the mid-hill where the proposed service reservoir would be situated .\n\n\nApproximately 900 soil nails in ten rows were installed for\nstabilisation of the newly formed slopes .\n\n\nExcavation of slopes and installation of soil nails had to proceed\nsimultaneously in order to maintain slope stability . \n\n \n\nTo achieve the objectives of safety and progress , the\nintermediate sequences for these two activities required very careful\nplanning in accurate cycles .\n\n\nTo avoid conflict between various construction activities , it was\ndecided to construct a very steep temporary access road first , thereby\nenabling multitasking and synchronisation of some construction activities .\n\n\nThus oil nailing and slope cutting could be expedited while\nexcavation at the service reservoir sit could be started simultaneously .\n\n\n \n\nThe service reservoir was constructed half way up a large\nnatural slope .\n\n\nThe original slope was quite steep , dictating the size of the\nplatform for construction of the service reservoir .\n\n\nDuring the construction stage , the space at the works area was so\ntight that the contractor encountered difficulties in moving the heavy mobile\ncranes around the site .\n\n\nTo overcome this , the contractor employed a tower crane , which was\nfound to be quite suitable and effective under the space constraint . \n\n \n\nThe 9 m high perimeter walls of the service reservoir were of\ncantilever wall design and consequently had relatively thick sections .\n\n\nTo minimise the risk of leakage , it was decided to cast each wall\nsection in one go without provision of intermediate construction joints .\n\n\nTemperature control during and after concrete casting was a key\nconsideration for these mass concreter pours .\n\n\nThis was especially crucial for the construction of water-retaining\nstructures where formation of cracks had to be precisely controlled .\n\n\nSeveral trials including the choice of concreting placing\ntemperature , curing method , use of additives , and use of cooling pipes\nwere investigated to explore and establish the ways to lower the maximum\ntemperature rise in the concrete .\n\n\nIn addition , thermocouples were placed inside the concrete cores to\nrecord the temperature rise and the temperature gradient across adjacent mass\nconcrete blocks .\n\n\nIn this case , the maximum rise in temperature was found to be\nacceptable when the concrete casting temperature was kept below 25&degree; C . \n \n\n\nTusi Lam Fresh Water Pumping Station  \n\n \n\nThe Tsui Lam Fresh Water Pumping Station was a three-level\nstructure (  ground floor , intermediate utility floor and lower basement ) to\nbe constructed to the north of the Tseung Kwan O Primary Service Reservoir .\n\n\nThe only access to the site was by a narrow internal access road by\nthe side of the service reservoir .\n\n\nVarious activities involving the use of the access road had to be\ncarefully planned and coordinated well in advance to avoid conflict . \n\n \n\nExtremely close supervision was exercised during the\nconstruction of the two basement floors to ensure watertightness of the\nstructure since the lower basement was some 9 m below ground .\n\n\nThe proposed watermain networks surrounding the pumping station ,\ntogether with the surge tank system , the power supply cables and the control\ncables , etc , created a very congested subsurface environment at the east\nand south sides of the pumping station .\n\n\nThe contractor and the site supervision team paid much attention to\nthe programming of all these works and many liaison meetings were held in\norder to minimise conflicts during construction .   \n\n\nConclusion  \n\n \n\nThis is a typical water supply project to expand the existing\nfresh water and slat water supply system to cater for new developments .\n\n\nThe period from inception to completion was rather short , spanning\nover only five years .\n\n\nSpace constraint at the service reservoir and the pumping station\nsites was one of the major difficulties encountered by the design and\nconstruction teams .\n\n\nWith the cooperation of staff from the Design Division , the\nConstruction Division , the in-house Mechanical &ampersand; Electrical project team and\nthe operation and maintenance divisions as well as the contractors , the\nproject was completed in time to meet the population intake . \n\n \n\nConstruction work totaling approximately HK&dollar;200 million\ncommenced in late 1997 .\n\n\nBoth the pumping station and the service reservoir as well as\ncritical sections of the water mains were completed in 2000 .\n\n\nThe remaining mainlaying works for improving the distribution system\ncommenced in1999 and are due for completion in 2002 . \n\n \n\n\nAbout the author: Ir H K Wu is an engineer who works in the\nConstruction

Because of the intensity of the\ndesigns , applying the wallpaper to all four sides of a room can result in a\ndizzying and claustrophobic effect - not the sort of look you  ' re probably\ngoing for , especially in a small room . \n\n \n\nMORN  ' s range of fabrics is also impressive .\n\n\nIf you spot a fabric that catches your eye , the shop can custom-make\na lampshade (  available in several sizes ) or even reupholster an entire sofa\nfor you .\n\n\nFabric prices start around &dollar;240 to &dollar;330 a year .\n\n\nFabrics and wallpaper aside , the shop also stocks an impressive\ncollection of ceiling lamps (  ranging in price from &dollar;230 to\n&dollar;4,000 ) , all of which are in near mint condition - a point Lee\nemphasizes , particularly for those interested in starting a collection .\n\n\nIf you  ' re around the area this week , be sure to drop in as there  ' s\na sale going on , which prices reduced up to 50 percent .  \n\n\n Faux Retro  \n\n \n\nIf you prefer to buy new furniture , but appreciate mid-century\nmodern designs , you could try D'Objets , a one month-old shop just a few\ndoors down from MORN .\n\n\nNot only does this shop specialize in Chinese Art Deco furniture , it\nalso carries newly made pieces of furniture that have taken their reference\nform designers form the  '  50s .\n\n\nElmwood cabinets (  currently reduced from &dollar;5,000 to\n&dollar;3,500 ) inspired by Japanese-American designer George Nakashima are\nespecially practical , providing plenty of storage as well as being an\nunderstated yet stylish solution to clutter .\n\n\nAll cabinets can be customized to suit your needs and are made of\nsolid wood . \n\n \n\nIf you  ' re scratching your head wondering why there are so few\ncharity shops around and no flea markets where you can find more of this\nstuff , you might want to pick up a tip from Chan and scour rubbish dumps for\nsome true bargains .\n\n\nChan attributes the lack of second-hand stores to the Chinese\nmentality of associating old or secondhand things as being \" dirty . &rdquo;\n\n\n \n\nRetro has deservedly earned its place in SoHo  ' s landscape of\ncool - and apart from being perennially hip , furniture from the  '  50s ,  ' \n60s and  '  70s will always be associated with decadent and fun times .\n\n\nWhile buying something made over 50 years ago may cost a lot more\nthan buying the equivalent piece brand new , the quality and character\nrepresented in each piece are more than a match for the largely mass-produced\nfurniture so rampant in stores today .

{"text": "A case of  Penicillium marneffei  osteomyelitis\ninvolving the axial skeleton   \n\n\nTS Pun , D Fang \n\n \n\n\nFungal infection of bone by  Penicillium marneffei  is rare .\n\n\nWe report on a case of  Penicillium marneffei  infection in a\nFilipino woman , which involved multiple soft-tissue abscesses and infection\nof the axial skeleton .\n\n\nEarly diagnosis and treatment of this potentially reversible disease\nis emphasised .\n\n\nSuch an approach is essential to prevent bony destruction from\nbecoming too advanced and , more importantly , to prevent any damage to the\nspinal cord from occurring .    \n\n\nIntroduction  \n\n \n\nOsteomyelitis can be caused by bacteria as well as fungi .\n\n\nThe disease is treatable with appropriate antibiotics or antifungal\nagents .\n\n\nDuring investigations , it is important to remember to look out for\nfungal infection .\n\n\nDoing so will also a proper and accurate diagnosis to be made .\n\n\nIn this way , appropriate treatment can be commenced and potentially\nserious complications can be avoided .   \n\n\nCase report  \n\n \n\nA 30-year-old Filipino woman presented to the Queen Mary Hospital\n( QMH ) in April 1993 with pyrexia of unknown origin and cervical\nlymphadenopathy .\n\n\nThe patient had a history of mixed connective disease and had\nattended regular follow-up at the Department of Medicine of the QMH .\n\n\nFever had developed 2 weeks before the hospital admission .\n\n\nOn arrival at the QMH , she was emaciated , in a toxic condition ,\nand had intermittent fever without any bone pain .\n\n\nA soft-tissue mass was felt over the forehead .\n\n\nMultiple firm and enlarged cervical lymph nodes were also palpable .\n\n\n \n\nLaboratory investigations showed a white blood cell count of 30.3\n&times; 10  9  / L (  normal range , 3.2-9.8 &times; 10  9  / L ) with\n93.6% neutrophils , haemoglobin level of 86 g/L (  normal range ,\n120-150 g/L ) , erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 133 mm/h (  normal range ,\n0-30 mm/h ) , and C-reactive protein level of 180 mg/L (  normal range ,\n100-270 mg/L ) .\n\n\nBlood culture was negative for bacteria and fungi .\n\n\nAll tests to detect viruses , including human immunodeficiency virus\ntypes 1 and 2 , gave negative results .\n\n\nAntinuclear factor was present , at a titre of 1:1080; rheumatoid\nfactor and antibodies to double-stranded DNA were absent .\n\n\nBiopsy examination of the bone marrow did not show any haematological\ndiseases . \n\n \n\nThe X-ray of the cervical spine showed lytic lesions at the C2\nvertebral body (  Fig 1 ) and the head of left humerus .\n\n\nMultiple lytic lesions were also visible over the proximal shaft of\nthe right femur .\n\n\nGallium bone scanning detected multiple sites of abnormal uptake in\nthe upper cervical spine , left shoulder , right side of manubrium , and\nright femur , which corresponded to multiple sites of infection .\n\n\nThe chest X-ray showed no evidence of pulmonary infection . \n\n \n\nAn excisional biopsy examination of a cervical lymph node showed\ngranulomatous lymphadenitis , but this finding was inconclusive .\n\n\nThe biopsy site failed to heal and persisted as a skin ulcer .\n\n\nStaining for acid-fast bacilli and fungi were negative .\n\n\nThe patient was given antituberculous drug treatment empirically .\n\n\nFine-needle aspiration of the soft-tissue mass on the left side of\nthe forehead revealed yeast cells .\n\n\nHisto-logical examination of decalcified sections of a core biopsy\nsample from the left humerus showed diffuse fibrosis of the intertrabecular\nspace and infiltration of histocytes .\n\n\nWell-formed granulomas or giant cells were absent .\n\n\nHowever , yeast-form fungi of 5 to 6 &mu;m in diameter were detected\nafter special staining tests had been performed .\n\n\nThese findings were consistent with tissue infection with \nPenicillium  species .  \n\n \n\nThe bony trabeculae were unremarkable and there was no evidence\nof lymphomatous infiltration .\n\n\nMicro-biological examination revealed dimorphic fungus , and fungal\nculture was positive for  Penicillium marneffei  .\n\n\nThe culture of the fine-needle aspirate from the fore-head mass was\nalso positive for  P marneffei  .\n\n\nThe pa-tient developed a left-arm abscess in the subcutaneous plane ,\nwhich extended up to the axilla about 1 week after core biopsy of the left\nhumerus .\n\n\nFifty millilitres of pus was drained; its culture confirmed infection\nwith  P marneffei  . \n\n \n\nFurther abscesses developed despite the commence-ment of\nantifungal treatment .\n\n\nThe patient was given intravenous amphotericin B and fluconazole .\n\n\nA retro-pharyngeal abscess presented itself with acute stridor and\ndyspnoea several days later .\n\n\nAnother abscess developed at the lateral aspect of the right thigh ,\nwith underlying osteomyelitis of the femur (  Fig 2 ) .\n\n\nBoth conditions were treated by performing surgical debridement .\n\n\nThe involvement of the C2 vertebral body was treated with antifungal\nmedication .\n\n\nThere was no neurological deficit or progression of the bony erosions .\n\n\n \n\nThe fever then subsided , and the results of blood investigations\nsuch as white blood cell count and measure-ment of the erythrocyte\nsedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level gradually returned to normal\nover 3 to 4 weeks .\n\n\nThe patient  ' s general condition improved , and she was able to walk\nwith support .\n\n\nShe later returned to the Philippines while continuing antifungal\ntherapy .   \n\n\nDiscussion  \n\n \n\nHuman infection with  P marneffei  was first documented\nin 1956 by Capponi.  1 \n\n\nThat case involved the accidental inoculation of the fungus into a\nlaboratory investigator , and the infection subsided with antifungal drug\ntreat-ment .\n\n\nThe organism has been isolated from the liver of bamboo rates from\nVietnam.  2 \n\n\nOther case reports showed that the patients with  P marneffei\n infection either lived in South-East Asia or had a history of\ntravelling to this region.  3 \n\n\nClinical infection with the organism has been reported in\nimmunocompromised patients as well as in healthy individuals.  4 \n\n\n \n\nThe combination of fever , lymphadenopathy , and the development\nof abscesses are common manifestations of infection with  P marneffei\n .\n\n\nThe lymphadenopathy may ulcerate and cause mediastinal compression -\na situation that may often mimic tuberculosis .\n\n\nLymph node biopsy is usually not helpful in distinguishing between\nthe two diagnoses.  5 \n\n\nWithout appropriate treat-ment , the infection may become\ndisseminated to the lung and liver .\n\n\nEventually , the infection may be fatal.  2,6 \n\n\nThe clinician should bear this differential diagnosis in mind when\nsuch clinical features are encountered .\n\n\nMost of the previously reported cases showed involvement mainly in\nsoft tissues and abdominal organs.  2,6 \n\n\nChan and Woo  3  reported on a patient with mainly\nperipheral skeletal involvement , which was manifested by multiple joint pain\n, swelling , and multiple radiolucent areas at the ends of various long bones\nand phalanges .\n\n\nJayanetra et al  6  described involvement of the long bones\n, skull , and ribs in two patients of their series .\n\n\nLouthrenoo et al  7  reported that one of eight patients\nshowed major involvement of the axial skeleton . \n\n \n\nIn the patient in this report , the  P marneffei \ninfec-tion progressed rapidly with bony destruction , soon after the onset of\ndisease .\n\n\nWhen the spine is involved , this rapid progression can be\npotentially serious , result in severe neurological deficit , and eventually\nbe fatal .\n\n\nEarly treatment is very important to prevent any irreversible damage\nto the spinal cord .\n\n\nDespite giving full-dose antifungal treatment to this patient , more\nsoft-tissue abscesses developed .\n\n\nThese symptoms probably reflect a slow onset of the effect of\nanti-fungal agents .\n\n\nThis delay further emphasises need for early treatment .  \n\n\n\nConclusion  \n\n \n\n Penicillium marneffei  infection in bone is rare .\n\n\nWhen it occurs , systemic upset can be severe .\n\n\nThere are multi-focal bony lytic lesions , which can be rapidly\nprogressive .\n\n\nBoth the axial and peripheral skeleton can be involved , and the soft\ntissues are usually also affected .\n\n\nRecent contact in South-East Asia should raise suspicion of\ninfection with  P marneffei  .\n\n\nEarly treatment is essential so that the bony destruction does not\nbecome too advanced and , more importantly , to prevent any damage to the\nspinal core from occurring . \n\n\n  \n\n\nManagement of thallium poisoning   \n\n\nPWI Pau \n\n \n\n\nA case of acute thallium poisoning in a 67-year-old Chinese woman is\ndescribed .\n\n\nShe presented with acute pain in the chest , abdomen , and lower\nlimbs .\n\n\nThe diagnosis was not made , however , until alopecia developed .\n\n\nDetoxification treatment , which included Prussian blue (  potassium\nferric hexacyanoferrate ) was given , but further neurological damage occurred .\n\n\nThe patient  ' s motor function recovered after 1 year , but residual\nsensory neuropathy remained .\n\n\nThis case illustrated that tissue-bound thallium may cause prolonged\nneurological damage if detoxification therapy is not commenced within 7 hours\nof the onset of acute poisoning .\n\n\nAcute abdominal pain and painful neuropathy in the lower extremities\nare important early diagnostic clues for timely therapy .\n\n\nHowever , by the time alopecia develops - typically around 2 weeks\nafter the onset of symptoms - detoxification therapy may not be able to\nprevent the development of prolonged neurological damage .   \n\n\n\nIntroduction  \n\n \n\nThallium is a heavy metal that is used in the manufacture of\nelectronics , alloys , and glass .\n\n\nIn clinical practice , thallium 201 is used as a radioactive tracer\nin heart scintigraphy to detect myocardial ischaemia .\n\n\nThallium and its salt are highly toxic , however , and industrial\nsafety guidelines exist in the workplace .\n\n\nAccidental poisoning has become rare in the domestic setting since\nthe 1970s , when thallium-based rodenticides were banned in many countries .\n\n\nThe majority of reported cases of thallium poisoning in the past two\ndecades have been caused by deliberate poisoning.  1-5   \n\n\n\nCase report  \n\n \n\nA 67-year-old Chinese woman was admitted to a country hospital in\nSan Jose , California , United States , in September 1997 because if acute\npain in the chest , abdomen , and lower limbs .\n\n\nThe pain in the lower limbs was described as burning and severe .\n\n\nThere was no vomiting or diarrhoea .\n\n\nThe patient was discharged after 3 days , but the cause of her\nillness was undetermined . \n\n \n\nThe patient presented to the author  ' s private clinic 1 week\nlater because of persistent symptoms .\n\n\nPhysical examination of the patient showed mild tenderness over the\nabdomen , and electrocardiography showed non-specific T-ware inversion in the\nanterior leads .\n\n\nRoutine urinalysis gave normal results , and laboratory tests showed\nnormal blood cell counts , blood glucose level , and kidney and liver\nfunction .\n\n\nThe patient was treated symptomatically with analgesics .\n\n\nShe was soon readmitted to hospital , however , because of\nprostration and fainting spells , as well as persistent symptoms .\n\n\nThe patient suspected that she was being poisoned .\n\n\nParanoid psychosis and trichotillomania were diagnosed , and she was\nadmitted under restraint to the psychiatric department for observation . \n\n \n\nAfter being discharged home , at week 5 , she returned to the\nauthor  ' s private clinic .\n\n\nAccording to the patient , the pain had become less severe .\n\n\nPhysical examination showed diffuse alopecia , which had started 2\nweeks after the onset of the initial symptoms .\n\n\nThallium poisoning was suspected .\n\n\nA urine sample was taken to measure its thallium content by\ngraphite-furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy .\n\n\nThe urine level of thallium was 8.56 &mu;mol/L (  normal level ,\n<0.003 &mu;mol/L; a level of  &greater-than; 0.98 &mu;mol/L is toxic ) .\n\n\nThe case was reported to the police; the prime suspect was the\npatient  ' s 73-year-old cohabitant . \n\n \n\nA dose of activated charcoal was given in the emergency\ndepartment of a nearby district hospital , and the patient was discharged\nhome with a 2-week supply of succimer (  2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid ) .\n\n\nAt follow-up at week 6 , however , it was found that the pain in her\nchest , abdomen , and lower limbs had subsided , but symptoms of peripheral\nneuropathy had emerged - namely , bilateral numbness and loss of\nexteroceptive and proprioceptive sensations in the toes .\n\n\nShe had mild weakness in the proximal muscles of the lower limbs ,\nas indicated by the patient  ' s difficulty in rising from the squatting\nposition .\n\n\nShe also complained of right-sided headache and tachy-cardia .\n\n\nShe was immediately admitted to the Stanford University Medical\nCenter for treatment with oral Prussians blue (  potassium ferric\nhexacyanoferrate , KFe  (  III )  (  Fe  (  II )  (  CN )  6\n  )  ) 4 g every 8 hours . \n\n \n\nThe blood thallium level at the time of hospitalisation was 0.15\n\u00b5mol/L; &greater-than; 0.49 &mu;mol/L is toxic ) .\n\n\nNo other heavy metals were present .\n\n\nThe patient tolerated Prussian blue very well , buy hypoaesthesia\ndeveloped over the medical aspect of her left calf on the second day of\ntreatment .\n\n\nShe was discharged home 1 week later , when the urine level of\nthallium was 0.14 &mu;mol/L . \n\n \n\nIn week 9 , the patient experienced neurological deterioration ,\nimpairment of short-term memory , double incontinence , tremor , ataxia , and\nfalls .\n\n\nPhysical examination showed hypoaesthesia of the right trigeminal\nnerve , general weakness of the extremities (  grade 4/5 ) , cerebellar ataxia , tremor , and dyskinesis .\n\n\nPlanter reflexes were normal , and the urine thallium level was 0.33\n\u00b5mol/L .\n\n\nBy week 14 , the right facial numbness fully recovered .\n\n\nBy week 20 , there was recovery of sphincter control and regrowth of\nhair .\n\n\nUrine thallium was undetectable 2 weeks later .\n\n\nThe weakness in the lower limbs , unsteady gait , falls , and\nbruises persisted until August 1998 , when her condition noticeably improved\n, although residual weakness remained .   \n\n\nDiscussion  \n\n \n\nThallium salts are colourless , tasteless , and odourless .\n\n\nThey are readily absorbed , and thallium becomes distributed\nthroughout the intravascular compartment within 4 hours .\n\n\nRedistribution between the extracellular and intracellular\ncompartments is complete within 24 hours .\n\n\nForty percent of the absorbed poison is excreted by the kidney;\n60% is excreted in the faeces , but its presence in the body is\nprolonged by the entero-hepatic circulation .\n\n\nThe elimination half-life can be as long as 30 days .\n\n\nA dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg is lethal.  5  \n\n \n\nWithin the cells , thallium displaces potassium in the Na-K\nATPase channel , which is responsible for generating ionic gradients in nerve\n, heart , and muscle cells .\n\n\nThallium also bins to sulphydryl groups , which act against free\nradicals , and with riboflavin , which mediates hydrogen transfer in tissue\nrespiratory systems and provides energy to maintain axon integrity .\n\n\nThe clinical manifestations of thallium poisoning depend on the\ndosage , chronicity , body weight , individual susceptibility , and the onset\nof treatment .\n\n\nEarly aggressive therapy with Prussian blue , forced diuresis , and\nhaemodialysis may not only be life-saving , but also reduce the duration and\nextent of neurological damage if they are given within 72 hours , as has been\nillustrated in five reported cases.  1,2 \n\n\nDespite the fact that the peak serum level of thallium exceeded 24\n&mu;mol/L in one case , neurological recovery was complete within 1 month in all\nfive cases . \n\n \n\nIn contrast , in a case in which treatment was delayed for 5\ndays after the onset of symptoms , the neurological damage lasted for more\nthan 9 months.  3 \n\n\nOther case reports have shown that more prolonged and possibly\npermanent neurological complications can occur when treatment is delayed\nuntil after the onset of alopecia.  4,5 \n\n\nAn extended electrophysiological study of a case of thallium\npoisoning has shown that distal axonopathies of the lower extremities may\ntake more than 2 years to recover.  6 \n\n\nNeurological deficit lasting more than 30 years has also been\nreported.  7 \n\n\nIn this case , treatment with Prussian blue in the 7th week of\nillness did not prevent the progression of neurological damage , although the\nthallium level had decreased to a non-toxic level after treatment . \n\n \n\nA high index of suspicion is required to diagnose thallium\npoisoning at an early stage .\n\n\nImportant clues are acute abdominal symptoms and painful neuropathy\nin the extremities occurring within 72 hours of the onset of initial symptoms .\n\n\nDifferential diagnoses include botulism , ciguatera poisoning ,\nporphyria , Guillaine-Barr\u00e9 syndrome , and poisoning with other heavy metals .\n\n\n \n\nThallium may be detected in the urine 1 hour after thallium\ningestion , but most clinical laboratories may not have the available\nfacilities to quantitatively analyse the thallium content .\n\n\nA rapid quantitative urine test can be done by mixing urine with\n0.4% sodium bismuth in 20% nitric acid and 10% sodium\niodide .\n\n\nA red precipitate indicates thallium is present .  8", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "15153ce9-721e-490e-b0ba-ba61dd28c12c", "added":

Bush is intent - world opinion with him or\nnot - on taking up his father  ' s failed bid to topple Iraq  ' s Saddam Hussein .\n\n\nThe Gulf War failure weighs heavily on the Bush family reputation , it\nseems , and the US is desperately trying to get international support for its\nefforts . \n\n \n\nSo far , there has been little enthusiasm for the war against\nterrorism to be extended to a country which has no proven links to Osama bin\nLaden or his al-Qaeda network .\n\n\nInternational chemical weapons inspection teams have been variously\nblocked and then allowed to carry out their duties by Saddam , but they have\nnot turned up any threats from his regime . \n\n \n\nMr Bustani  ' s ousting was therefore shameful , but hardly\nsurprising .\n\n\nSince Mr Bush took office 15 months ago , his government has\nsystematically pushed its own course on issues ranging from human rights to\nthe environment .\n\n\nIt is clear that it intends to push its own agenda for the sake of\nits own needs and desires . \n\n \n\nThe pity is that the rest of the world is the loser .\n\n\nThe US , by far the world  ' s biggest polluter , went its own way on\nthe Kyoto Protocol on climate control , letting its factories set their own\ntargets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions .\n\n\nLast week , it removed Robert Watson , the outspoken climatologist\nwho chaired the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change . \n\n \n\nThe US also walked out of a race conference in South Africa last\nyear because it did not like criticism of its ally , Israel , over the\nconflict with the Palestinians .\n\n\nIn recent days , it has again sided with Israel over incursions of\nthe West Bank . \n\n \n\nIt is lamentable that the US uses its economic advantage so\nfreely .\n\n\nPerhaps it is time other nations became more vocal and use diplomatic\nmeans to counter such practices . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  SAR still leads way  \n\n \n\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit made some worthwhile observations\nin its latest ranking table of the world  ' s best business locations .\n\n\nIn downgrading Hong Kong it argues the lack of decisive government ,\nrefusal to adopt a competition law and skills shortages are retarding the\nterritory . \n\n \n\nIt also rehashes a traditional lament of falling English\nstandards and lost purpose in light of China  ' s full economic opening with\nscant analytical backing .\n\n\nAs a commentary the report ranks as an interesting opinion .\n\n\nJudged as a rigorous comparative analysis it predictably lacks\nsubstance . \n\n \n\nThe EIU argues that Singapore has outdone Hong Kong in forming\npolicy towards private enterprise and competition .\n\n\nIt also cites Singapore  ' s stronger fiscal position .\n\n\nWhile the city state has moved ahead of Hong Kong in a number of nuts\nand bolts policy areas , we would contend its findings . \n\n \n\nSingapore  ' s typically low-value-added manufacturing industries\nface accelerating hollowing-out pressures .\n\n\nDespite a dramatic depreciation of its currency , deflation remains\nembedded .\n\n\nLow economy-wide returns on capital suggest a future funding crisis\nof pensions and welfare payments while opaque government accounts means its\ntrue fiscal position is difficult to gauge .\n\n\nDevelopment of service industries lags Hong Kong by a mile and\nentrepreneurship remains weak . \n\n \n\nThe point is not to disparage Singapore .\n\n\nHowever the EIU comparison takes on more than point-scoring\nsignificance because many in the SAR want Hong Kong to embrace similar\npolicies .\n\n\nAs a result , understanding what makes this economy fundamentally\nstrong , and why the Singapore model is past its sell-by-date , is important .\n\n\n \n\nHong Kong and Singapore share common problems of a painful\nunwinding from a government-sponsored property bubble .\n\n\nThey differ in the way they allocate capital across the rest of their\neconomies .\n\n\nHong Kong is far down the road to restructuring from a manufacturing\nto services based economy .\n\n\nWhile less physical goods will inevitably flow through the SAR , that\ndoes not mean the value-creating activity backing such trade is lost . London\nand New York are good examples . \n\n \n\nHong Kong firms are China  ' s best firms .\n\n\nMany remain low key but are quietly building efficient operations\nacross the mainland .\n\n\nThe SAR faces many socio-political challenges , but fretting over\nlost competitiveness is an unjustified distraction . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Explicit message  \n\n \n\nThe symbolic message could not have been clearer .\n\n\nInstead of heading straight to the United States , Vice-President Hu\nJintao has chosen to make a long detour to Malaysia and Singapore before\nvisiting the world  ' s most powerful nation . \n\n \n\nIn Kuala Lumpur yesterday , the message was explicit .\n\n\nIn a keynote address , Mr Hu , who is widely believed to be in line\nto succeed Jiang Zemin as President , said \" (  China ) opposes the\nstrong lording it over the weak and the big bullying the small . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nWhile this has been the consistent line of China and , Mr Hu\nnamed no country , there can be no doubt about the identity of the \"\nstrong &rdquo; country being the United States .\n\n\nThat Mr Hu has reiterated this line was a calculated attempt to set\nthe stage for his impending tour of America . \n\n \n\nAs the world  ' s largest developing nation , China wants to be\nidentified with other countries whose primary goal is to improve the\nlivelihood of their people . \n\n \n\nBut while its rapid economic growth has inspired admiration ,\ncountries in the region are also increasingly concerned that China is sucking\nin more and more foreign investment that could have gone to them . \n\n \n\nTo address these concerns , Mr Hu yesterday thanked Asian\ncountries for their support of China  ' s accession to the World Trade\nOrganisation .\n\n\nBut he also noted that China had helped the region by weathering the\nAsian financial crisis without causing further instability by devaluating the\nrenminbi . \n\n \n\nMilitarily , the region  ' s leaders still harbour memories of\nChina  ' s support of communist insurgents from the 1950s to the 1970s .\n\n\nMr Hu  ' s reiteration of China  ' s pledge not to seek hegemony , not to\njoin any military bloc , and not to pursue its own spheres of influence was\ntherefore necessary . \n\n \n\nAlready , some Asian countries have invited the United States to\nmaintain a presence in the region to counter the perceived threat of China .\n\n\nThe last thing that China wants is to be seen as a giant keen to flex\nits muscle to meddle in other countries ' affairs . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Confusion in the air  \n\n \n\nWorries about the quality of the air we breathe in Hong Kong are\nbad enough: surveys have repeatedly shown that air pollution is the number\none concern for an increasing portion of the population .\n\n\nNow comes news that there is another measure of pollution - other\nthan the Air Pollution Index - which is measured by the Government but not\ngenerally released to the public .\n\n\nThe concerned layman has every right to feel somewhat bemused . \n\n \n\nTo create further confusion , figures for fine pollution\nparticles , or PM2.5 , are also not generally released in many other parts of\nthe world; more importantly no legal limit is set on the amount of PM2.5\nspecifically to be present in the air . \n\n \n\nThe situation in the US is different.\n\n\nFollowing evidence that such pollutants were especially dangerous to\nhealth it was decided to set limits . \n\n \n\nWhether PM10 - the combined measure of large and small particles\n- is the index of importance or that which measures only small particles is\nnot yet , it seems , quite clear . \n\n \n\nThere is certainly no question of the Government hiding any data .\n\n\nNevertheless , when it is learned that levels of small particles ,\nwhich are linked to lung disease and respiratory problems , are up to four\ntimes the US legal limit , alarm bells must surely start to sound . \n\n \n\nConcern is exacerbated by research carried out by the University\nof Hong Kong that found that 4,300 people a year are dying prematurely from\ninhaling polluted air and 17,000 are admitted to hospital . \n\n \n\nWhat is common sense is that more action needs to be taken\nurgently to bring down all levels of pollution , because people are demanding\nit and because it also makes economic sense .\n\n\nUltimately , reducing all harmful emissions is the priority , not\ntrying to differentiate different levels of toxicity . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Heeding the call  \n\n \n\nAssassinated Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn represented the face of\na newly resurgent wave of right-wing politics in Europe .\n\n\nAttracting loyalty and opposition in equal measure , Fortuyn built\nhis politics around populist themes such as stopping immigration and reducing\ncrime . \n\n \n\nHis assassination has shocked a nation that has long prided\nitself on its traditions of tolerance and peaceful debate .\n\n\nAs tens of thousands of people paid their last respects at his\nfuneral in Rotterdam yesterday  fri  , pollsters predicted a\nsympathy vote in coming elections that could catapult his party into helping\nform a new government . \n\n \n\nFortuyn was perhaps not as bigoted as France  ' s Jean-Marie Le Pen\n, who caused a stir in France last month by winning the first round of the\npresidential poll .\n\n\nNeither were his views as extreme as Austria  ' s Joerg Haider . \n\n \n\nBut like the leaders of the French and Austrian right , Fortuyn\nfilled a niche in the right wing of the Dutch political spectrum , feeding on\nvoters ' disillusionment with the established political parties , playing on\nfeelings of nationalism and xenophobia . \n\n \n\nFar-right and anti-immigrant candidates have in recent years\nhelped form coalition governments in Austria and Italy .\n\n\nAs in France , they have also made gains in Belgium , Denmark and the\nNetherlands .\n\n\nAll these parties have benefited from the anxiety that many ordinary\npeople feel when faced with growing unemployment , slowing economic growth\nand the growth of a new layer of government in the European Union . \n\n \n\nWhile today  ' s European far-right parties do not espouse\ndictatorship and violence , the rise in their support even in traditionally\nliberal societies like the Netherlands and Scandinavia , marks a new mood in\nthe continent .\n\n\nThere is a danger that the more established political parties will\nmove rightwards as well , leading to a less tolerant Europe . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  End of the line  \n\n \n\nThe decision by the KCRC chairman , Michael Tien Puk-sun to ask\nmembers of the company  ' s board to take greater responsibility for monitoring\nits operations is a welcome first step towards plugging some of the\nmanagement holes identified in the recent investigation by auditors . \n\n \n\nMr Tien has said that he expects each board member to chair\ncommittees within the board which would exercise greater oversight over the\nway the KCRC functions .\n\n\nIt is not clear whether Mr Tien is also considering other\nsuggestions made by the auditor , Ernest and Young , including the\nappointment of new directors with experience of handling major projects .\n\n\nIt is important that new procedures are put in place speedily to\navoid the kind of problems that had emerged earlier . \n\n \n\nThe splitting of the roles of chairman of the board and chief\nexecutive officer that has already happened has been a step towards creating\ngreater accountability .\n\n\nIdeally , this opportunity should be used to create a new management\nculture in public organisations like the KCRC .\n\n\nFor various historical reasons , government corporations like the\nKCRC have been the preserve of former civil servants .\n\n\nThey have brought to these jobs considerable administrative and\npractical experience , but not enough of the skills that are required to run\nbusiness corporations .\n\n\nProcedures and methods of work that might have been acceptable in\nthe Government , appear to be poor management in the context of a corporation .\n\n\n \n\nAs new management systems are put in place , it is important\nthat the controversy raised by the extra payments to one of the contractors\nbe put aside .\n\n\nAn investigation by an external auditor has been completed , those\nfound wanting have apologised for their negligence , and the company  ' s\nchairman has promised tighter controls .\n\n\nThere is little to be gained by endless debate on whether any of the\nofficials should step down , or whether a new probe is required . \n\n \n\nIt is important for Hong Kong that the West Rail project be\ncompleted smoothly .\n\n\nIf the chief executive or any other senior staff were to step down ,\nthe project could be jeopardised . \n\n \n\nIn the long run , it is important to ensure sound corporate\ngovernance in companies like the KCRC .\n\n\nThe obvious way to achieve this is to gradually privatise them ,\nand allow the shareholders to appoint independent directors , and to submit\nthese corporations to the discipline of the market place .\n\n\nUltimately , this is the best way to ensure that they serve the\nneeds of the public . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Common ground  \n\n \n\nSoutheast Asian countries are taking long-overdue steps towards\nstandardising laws against terrorism and cross-border crimes .\n\n\nThe measures will be difficult to put into place and enforce , but\nall efforts must be made to make the region safer . \n\n \n\nPorous borders , especially between Indonesia , Malaysia and\nthe Philippines and Laos , Myanmar and Thailand , have fostered extensive\ncriminal activity .\n\n\nExtremist groups and criminal networks have flourished and made\ndrug trafficking , money laundering , kidnapping and piracy widespread . \n\n \n\nSince the terrorist attacks in the United States on September\n11 , it has become clear that controls need to be implemented and\nco-ordinated . \n\n \n\nPolice and officials of the 10-member Association of Southeast\nAsian Nations decided at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur this week to make their\ncriminal codes more alike and to share information on crimes and criminal\nactivity . \n\n \n\nEfficiency and will are the catch-words but whether some Asean\ncountries have the resources and resolve is questionable . \n\n \n\nThis is especially true in the \" Golden triangle &rdquo;\nregion of northern Thailand , Laos and Myanmar , where heroin and synthetic\ndrugs are flooding out at increasing rates . \n\n \n\nImproved co-operation between Indonesia , Malaysia and the\nPhilippines in tackling kidnapping gangs and Muslim extremists perhaps is the\nexample to follow . \n\n \n\nThe diverse economies and legal and political systems of Asean\ncountries make putting rules into place a daunting task .\n\n\nBut with the threat of terrorism so great , the effort obviously\nhas to be made . \n\n \n\nIf we are to truly feel safe , nations in the region must\nco-operate more and act swiftly to find common ground .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "Chinese-Western Comparative Drama in Perspective  \n\n\n\nYun-tong Luk \n\n \n\nThe map for Chinese-Western comparative drama study can be charted\nout from the area pertaining to Chinese-Western comparative literature study .\n\n\nIn other words , it may generally be assumed that methods and\npractices apropos the former study may not be dissimilar to those apropos the\nlatter .\n\n\nBearing in mind theatre  ' s mediumistic exigencies , which call for\nspecial treatment and investigation , one could perhaps propose that\nChinese-Western comparative study , as dramatic literature study , may well\nproceed with the follow steps : \n\n \n\nInfluence Studies :\n\n\nThis method has often centred on influences between Chinese and\nWestern playwrights , reception and comparison of works , directing , acting\nsystem or theatre theories , Chinese and Western .\n\n\nExamples can be found in studies on Stanislavski  ' s Method system on\nmodern Chinese theatre or on the applicability of Stanislavski  ' s Method in\ntraditional Peking opera , the impact of Chinese style of acting on Bertolt\nBrecht  ' s dramaturgy or even the latter  ' s reverse influence on contemporary\nChinese theatre , etc .\n\n\nStudies characterized by this method are quite numerous .\n\n\nThey could cover as wide a range of contents as Eugene O'Neill and\nTaoism (  Chung-wai Literary Monthly  , Vol. 7 , No.7\n) , Strindberg and his oriental outlook (  Chung-wai\nLiterary Monthly  , Vol. 13 , No. 6 ) , Brecht  ' s Epic Theatre\nand traditional Chinese theatre (  Ming Pao Monthly  , Feb .\n1981 ) , Ts'ao Yu and Chekhovian and O'Neillian influences (\n Ming Pao Monthly  , Sept. 1969 ) , etc. , to name just but a\nfew . \n\n \n\nParallel and Affinity Studies :\n\n\nMethods of study in this category mainly focus on the affinity\nbetween dramatic works which have no   rapports de fait\n  whatsoever , except stylistic , structural or ideological\nresemblances .\n\n\nThese examples can consists in parallel study of plays , Chinese and\nEuropean , such as  Romeo and Juliet  and   Chiao hung\nChi    (  Essays in\nComparative Literature Studies  .\n\n\nTianjin : Nankai University Press , 1984 ) ,  Macbeth\n and   Fa tzu tu    (  Tu shu  , 1986.5 ) ,   Hsi hsiang\nchi    and  Romeo and Juliet\n (  Kwang Hua University Bi-monthly  , Vol. 4 , Nos. 1\n&ampersand; 3 , Oct./Nov. 1935 ) ,  Hamlet  and \n Hu-tieh meng    (\n Chung-wai Literary Monthly  , Vol. 4 , No. 4 ) , etc .\n\n\nAll in all , these methods could cover the so-called \"\n rapports exterieurs  &rdquo; as well as \" \nrapports interieurs  &rdquo; between Chinese and Western dramatic\nworks . \n\n \n\nGenology Studies :\n\n\nExamples of this nature in general borrow Western generic concepts\nsuch as tragedy , comedy or melodrama to study Chinese dramatic works with a\nview to shedding some light on the structural , ideological and typological\nconstructs of Chinese drama .\n\n\nPerhaps one of the earliest pioneer works is Ch'ien Chung-shu  ' s  article , \" Tragedy in Old Chinese Drama\n&rdquo; published in  T'ien hsia  \nmagazine in 1935 .\n\n\nMore recent examples have run the gamut from Ku T'ian-hung  ' s  \"  Tou O  as Tragedy &rdquo; (\n Chung-wai Literary Monthly  , Vol. 4 , No. 8 ) , Cheung\nPing-cheung  ' s  \"  Tou O Yuan  as\nTragedy &rdquo; (  Chung-hsi pi-chiao wen-hsueh lun chi  .\n\n\nTaipei : Shih Pao Book Series 203 ) .\n\n\nChang Han-liang  ' s  \" Kuan Han Ching  ' s\n Tou O Yuan  : A Melodrama &rdquo; (  Chung-wai Literary\nMonthly  , Vol. 4 , No. 8 ) , to Y. T. Luk  ' s  \" Tragedy as Genre and Its Applicability in Chinese\nDrama &rdquo; (  Literature Quarterly  , Vol. 24 , Dec. 1982\n) and Chiao Teh-wen  ' s  \" On the\nDifferences between the Concept of Chinese Tragedy and the Concept of Western\nTragedy &rdquo; (  Hsi-chu i-shu  , Vol. I , 1982 ) .\n\n\n \n\nThough the three kinds of approach pertaining to Chinese-Western\ncomparative drama can be subsumed in the general parameters of\nChinese-Western comparative literature study , however , we need to pay\nattention to the fact that drama study has two sides of a coin , the other\nside being drama as theatre , which , as its mediumistic nature entails , has\nto be different from literature study after all , be it general or\ncomparative .\n\n\nBesides , theatre study or analysis involves performance and\nperformance has its most essential human dimension , which comes from actors\nacting their roles , i.e. , their particular actorly artistry , systems of\nperformance , and the playwright-director-audience triangle , all of which\nform a very complex and multi-level matrix of relationship .\n\n\nThese are matters germane to the theatre as a means of expression ,\nand require thus special methods and practices suitable to the theatre to\nbody forth its expression .\n\n\nHence , they should , in accord with its medium , transcend methods\nand practices pertaining to general and comparative literature study .\n\n\nIt follows then that a viable and distinct methodology for the\ninvestigation and study of Chinese-Western comparative drama is in order , in\naddition to what has already been made available by Chinese-Western\ncomparative literature study in general . \n\n \n\nAt this point in time , some initial steps have been taken .\n\n\nOne has seen works addressing themselves to comparing the concept of\ntheatre in China and the West , Grotowski  ' s Poor Theatre and Chinese theatre\n, aesthetic ideals in the system of Brecht , Stanislavski and the Chinese\ntheatre , etc .\n\n\nOne cannot expect an instant methodology , least of all a poetics .\n\n\nCertainly , theoretical and methodological fruition needs time to\ncome to being .\n\n\nIn the future , comparative study on Chinese-Western drama and\ntheatre will have to be armed with more genre and medium conscious\nmethodology and practice , which will have been the convergent efforts of\nboth theatre practitioners and scholars interested in the Chinese-Western\ncomparative perspective .\n\n\nPresumably , these efforts will and should concern themselves with\ncomparing the concept of theatre in China and the West , systems of\nperformance as well as directing , uses of theatre language and space ,\naudience response , etc .\n\n\nThese efforts or endeavours should enhance the viability of\nChinese-Western comparative drama as academic discipline , the research\nmethods of which embrace yet transcend the scope of mere comparativism and\nnominal internationalism , with a view to eventually establishing a\nChinese-Western comparative drama poetics . \n\n \n\nIn view of this aim , the present collection of essays is a\nmodest step taken in that direction .\n\n\nIt is , nevertheless , significant and important to note that this is\nthe first collection of essays in English , devoted to Chinese-Western\ncomparative drama .\n\n\nAll of the articles were read at the Fourth Hong Kong International\nComparative Literature Conference held in 17-21 August 1987 and sponsored by\nthe Comparative Literature Research Unit of the English Department of The\nChinese University of Hong Kong .\n\n\nThe collection shows a wide range of topics of Chinese-Western\ncomparative drama interest , and represents to a large extent the general\nconcern and quality of the conference .\n\n\nMoreover , it reflects efforts by drama scholars and theatre\npractitioners in this rather new territory of research .\n\n\nBy no means does this collection claim to be authoritative or presume\nto lay down guidelines or directives .\n\n\nHowever , it does hope to demonstrate some possibilities in the area\nof Chinese-Western comparative drama and serve important informative and\ninspirational purposes . \n\n \n\nThe present collection contains fourteen articles , which by\ntheir thematic and methodological nature can be arranged in five categories\nfor discussion and review .\n\n\nThe articles by Drs. Fong , Sato and Tam are concerned with the\ninfluence and reception of European drama in modern Chinese and Japanese\ndrama .\n\n\nDr. Fong  ' s article , \" Western Influence and the Rise of\nModern Chinese Drama, &rdquo; offers an appropriate area of investigation for\nChinese-Western comparative drama scholars , analyzing and comparing three\nmodern Chinese plays ,  The Greatest Event in Life  by Hu Shih ,\n Yama Chao  by Hung Shen and  Wang Chao-chun  by Kuo Mo-jo\n, with their respective Western prototypes ,  A Doll  ' s House  by\nIbsen ,  Emperor Jones  by O'Neill and  Salome  by Oscar\nWilde .\n\n\nThough with only three case studies , the article is a legitimate\nattempt at establishing   rapports de fait  \nbetween these three sets of plays , shedding light on certain issues about\nadaptation and indigenization .\n\n\nPerhaps , one may feel a little uneasy with the configurations to the\nrise of modern Chinese drama to be provided by three individual plays . \n\n \n\nCompared with Fong  ' s panoramic view of the rise of modern\nChinese drama , Dr. Tam  ' s \" Drama of Dilemma : Waiting as Form and\nMotif in  The Bus-stop  and  Waiting for Godot  \" is\nmore specific in its thematic parallel approach , dwelling on the existential\ntheme of waiting and the passage of time as main aspects of comparison &semi;\nthough distinguishing the Chinese play  ' s social and political implications\nfrom the Western play  ' s philosophical and religious concerns , Tam seems to\nhave dwelt a bit too often on thematic parallelism and explication , and has\nto justify the first half of his title , \" Waiting as Form &rdquo; more\n, in addition to mentioning only in passing both plays share a circular\nstructure .\n\n\nIf there is another caveat one has to make , perhaps , it is his\nenthusiasm in analogizing the time parallels in both plays , which at times\nstrikes one as a bit passionate for sameness . \n\n \n\nDr. Toshihiko Sato  ' s article , \" Ibsen  ' s  The Lady\nfrom the Sea  , T'ien Han  ' s  Return to the South  , and Sato\nKoroku  ' s  The Disabled Horse  : A Comparative Study, &rdquo; is\nwhat its title tries to suggest .\n\n\nThrough textual analysis , Dr. Sato points out that the two Asian\nplays were written under the influence of Ibsen  ' s romantic play , and that\namong them , there are enough parallels in dialogue , characterization and\ndramatic techniques to warrant a case of influence and reception .\n\n\nReasonable as it sounds , Sato  ' s article is informative , pointing\nout what has already been known generally , and could use more in-depth\ncultural and aesthetic analysis .\n\n\nThe interesting aspect of Sato  ' s article , however , lies in its\nintra-Asian comparative literature perspective , and raises a curious\nquestion : How do the Chinese and Japanese writers , in this case , T'ien Han\nand Sato Koroku , differ or resemble each other in their cultural and\nliterary adoption of Ibsen  ' s ideas and dramaturgy , conditioned as they were\nby their own cultural , traditional , aesthetic and social milieu ?\n\n\nThis would seem a very crucial and enriching aspect to the\nreinforcement of a somewhat generalized comparison . \n\n \n\nThe second group of articles by Professors C. H. Wang , Han-liang\nChang and Mr. Sai-shing Yung share a structural concern in their respective\nanalyses .\n\n\nProfessor Wang  ' s article , \" The Double Plot of  T'ao-hua\nshan  \" is an analysis of the interrelationship between fiction\nand historicity embedded in a double plot , which dramatizes respectively the\nrepresentation of a romantic love affair on the one hand , and the fall of\nthe Ming empire on the other .\n\n\nThis dual representation is    intertwined\n  by the double plot structure in such a way , according to Professor\nWang , that \" it employs the emotions entailed by separation and union\nto depict feelings about the rise and fall. &rdquo; Though without expressly\nclaiming to define the tragic theme or spirit of the play , his analysis of\nthe double plot framework converges on what he describes as \"\ntheatrically moving and literarily powerful, &rdquo; which is just the tragic\nessence of this particular play . \n\n \n\nMore structuralist in argumentation , Professor Han-liang Chang  ' s\narticle , \" Mimetic Desire/Dramatic Structure : Racine  ' s  Phaedra\n Ma Chih-yuan  ' s  Han-kung ch'iu  , &rdquo; begins with an\nelucidation of Rene Girard  ' s triangular model of desire , mediator and\n vaniteur  , and A. J. Griemas  '  actantial matrix of\ndesire , communication and power &semi;\n\n\nhe follows in the second part with the application of these two\nmodels interchangeably to two dramatic texts widely separated in time and\nspace as Racine  ' s  Phaedra  and Ma chih-yuan  ' s  Han-kung ch'iu\n .\n\n\nProfessor Chang  ' s objective is to point out relationships between\ndesire and writing , verbal relations between characters in the dramatic\ndiscourse , or relationships between the playwright and his precursor .\n\n\nIn the course of applying Girard and Griemas , he also makes\nreference to Freud  ' s Eros and Thanatos , concerning the character analysis\nof Hippolytus and Khan Hu-yen of the two plays in question . \n\n \n\nMr. Sai-shing Yung  ' s article , \"  Tsa-chu  as a\nLyrical Form, &rdquo; is a lucid account of the aesthetics of Yuan \ntsa-chu  as being constituted by two structural elements , the narrative\nact and the lyrical act which govern the movement of events and the movement\nof mind respectively .\n\n\nMr. Yung points out the significance of the actor-oriented system of\nChinese theatre is attributed to centring the main character in the lyrical\nact , and thereby explains one of the most salient features of traditional\nChinese theatre .\n\n\nThough Mr. Yung is traditional in his elucidation as a whole , he at\ntimes cross-refers to Russian formalism as well as semiotics to help clarify\nhis argument . \n\n \n\nThe third group of articles by Miss Shu-chu Wei , Dr. Sheng-chuan\nLai and Mr. William Hui-zhu Sun are more theatre-oriented in their analyses .\n\n\nMiss Wei  ' s article , \" English Renaissance Acting : With\nReference to Peking Opera, &rdquo; is an application of Peking opera\ntechniques to some of the Elizabethan plays , especially Shakespeare  ' s ,\nwith the intention of \" representing &rdquo; the Elizabethan acting\nstyle , an attempt inspired by Professor Leonard Pronko  ' s application of\nKabuki to the Elizabethan plays for the same purpose .\n\n\nMiss Wei points out the open stage , simplicity of properties ,\nfluidity of location , imaginative participation of the audience as\nconstituent points of parallels , taking examples from  Romeo and Juliet\n ,  A Midsummer Night  ' s Dream  ,  The Tempest  , \nDr. Faustus  ,  Hamlet  and  King Lear  .\n\n\nMiss Wei  ' s speculation is interesting and is not far-fetched as it\nmay seem at first .\n\n\nIn fact , what she is proposing is not an imposition of foreign model\nbut an exposition of the salient features shared in general by all\nnon-illusionistic theatres . \n\n \n\nDr. Sheng-chuan Lai  ' s article , \" The Structuring of\nSpontaneity : An Assessment and Documentation of Improvisational Creative\nMethods in the Modern Taiwan Theatre, &rdquo; begins with a general\nbackground to the use of improvisation in the arts &semi;\n\n\nthen it moves on to detail the rise of improvisation in the decade\nfrom 1978 to 1987 in modern Taiwanese theatre , with a specific and personal\nillustration of the writer  ' s own works .\n\n\nWith an eye on the theatre , Dr. Lai states how he works with the\nmethod through a continual process of interaction between director and actors .\n\n\nAccording to him , the objective of this improvisational method is\ntwofold : to experiment new forms of expression and to rebel against\ntraditional forms and methods in Chinese theatre .\n\n\nNevertheless , he acknowledges that such a rebellion eventually takes\non certain characteristics of traditional forms and method , and hence , he\nends his articles not without some ambivalence , registering the feelings of\nhow a die-hard tradition-conscious psyche grapples with the fact of\nassimilating Western methods and influence . \n\n \n\nMr. William Hui-zhu Sun  ' s article , \" Blurring Line\nbetween Stage and Life : &lsquo; Poor Theatre &rsquo; in China, &rdquo;\nborrows more Grotowski  ' s terminology than his concept of theatre to discuss\nthe rural theatre in Ting Hsien of northern China between 1932 and 1936 , led\nby Hsiung Fo-hsi  , one of the pioneers of modern\nChinese theatre .\n\n\nMr. Sun  ' s article touches on a topic of theatrical interest , which\nsurprisingly has seldom been heeded by scholars .\n\n\nMr. Sun is to be credited with having called our attention to it .\n\n\nHowever , Mr. Sun seems a bit so carried away with his Grotowskian\nparallel that he raises a few methodological loose ends .\n\n\nSpeaking of the \" poorness &rdquo; of the pre-modern Chinese\nexperimental theatre , led by Hsiung Fo-hsi , Mr. Sun  \nsucceeds  in demonstrating the poorness of this theatre in its\nsocio-economic sense , which is not exactly Grotowski  ' s \" back to the\nessentials &rdquo; poorness , with its emphasis on actor-training and\nactor-audience relationships .\n\n\nHsiung  ' s theatre , though involving peasants and amateurs , may lend\nitself to be \" poor &rdquo; in view of its actor-audience proximity ,\nbeing ritualistic and paratheatrical in nature &semi; but it show hardly any\nconcern for rigorous training of actors . \n\n \n\nThe fourth group of articles is represented by two\nShakespeare-related studies .\n\n\nProfessor Mei-shu Hwang  ' s article , \" The deaths of Cordelia\nand Tou O : Morality or Theatricality, &rdquo; does not purport to make a\ncase of affinity study between  King Lear  and  Tou O yuan  .\n\n\nInstead , he attempts to use elements of their plots , i.e. , the\ndeaths of Cordelia and Tou O , more specifically , Tou O  ' s three wishes and\ntheir eventual fulfilment , to show the playwright  ' s choice between logical\nprobability and theatrical effectiveness .\n\n\nThus , it may not be necessary to cavil at the logic of their\ndevelopment as Hwang  ' s argument seems to suggest , if the desired\ntheatricality is to be realized .\n\n\nHence , moral feelings about these two plays should be secondary to\nwhat Professor Hwang calls theatricality .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "caf5e687-0c43-411a-a48a-2a03c3da6a9d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.980357+00:00"}

Statement   \n\n\n Residential Care Homes ( Elderly Persons )\nOrdinance  \n\n \n\nThe Residential Care Homes ( Elderly Persons )\nOrdinance was enacted in October 1994 .\n\n\nIt aims to regulate homes established for the residential care of\nelderly persons who have attained the age of 60 years .\n\n\nThe Ordinance has come into full operation on June 1 , 1996 . \n\n \n\nThe purpose of the legislation is to ensure that residential care\nhomes for the elderly provide services of a reasonable standard and that the\nwelfare of the elderly residents is safeguarded . \n\n \n\nUnder the Ordinance , residential care homes are regulated either\nby licence or certificate of exemption . \n\n \n\nLicences may be issued to residential care homes which are able\nto comply with the requirements in accordance with the Ordinance .\n\n\nThe policy of the Social Welfare Department is that all residential\ncare homes which come into existence and which want to commence operation on\nor after April 1 , 1995 should be subject to regulation by the issue of a\nlicence rather than the issue of a certificate of exemption .\n\n\nThe main reason for the policy is that regulation under a licence\nwill in the opinion of the Director of Social Welfare , better ensure high\nstandards of residential care for elderly persons and better safeguard the\ninterests of elderly residents than will regulation under a certificate of\nexemption .\n\n\nNo doubt the Director of Social Welfare will consider applications\nfor certificates of exemption .\n\n\nHowever , it is unlikely that he will , in accordance with the policy\n, issue a certificate of exemption for any residential care home which comes\ninto existence and which is to commence operation on or after April 1 , 1995\nunless there is something exceptional in the circumstances which warrant a\ndeparture from the policy . \n\n \n\nWith regard to certificates of exemption , the policy of the\nSocial Welfare Department is that they are to be granted to residential care\nhomes already in operation before April 1 , 1995 but which are unable to\ncomply fully with the legislative requirements .\n\n\nThe reason is to allow them to continue in operation in the interests\nof the residents as well as in the interests of the operators in business\nterms .\n\n\nIf there is danger to the residents or their well-being may be\nadversely affected , the procedure for revocation is much simpler than for a\nlicence .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "cf2bc325-1fcc-410c-93e0-f1f66745f045",

{"text": "Futile gamble  \n\n \n\nAfter deciding not to press ahead with moves to legalise soccer\nbetting for the time being , the Government has revived its bid to push\nthrough a bill that targets overseas bookmakers . \n\n \n\nThe Gambling (  Amendment ) Bill 2000 , if passed , will make\nbookmaking an offence , regardless of whether it is conducted here or from\noutside Hong Kong . \n\n \n\nWhat is ironic , as officials noted in their submission to the\nlegislature , is that \" the policy intention is that betting directly\nwith an overseas bookmaker is not illegal if the bookmaker does not in any\nway conduct the bookmaking , offer betting-related services and promote its\nbusiness in Hong Kong\" . \n\n \n\nThere is a sense of futility in the Government  ' s expressed\nintention .\n\n\nIt recognises the fact that it is well-nigh impossible to prosecute\nindividuals for placing bets on the Internet in the privacy of their home .\n\n\nThat is , unless police are prepared to knock down doors to check on\nsuspected gamblers - a most preposterous proposition . \n\n \n\nAnd unless the overseas-based bookmakers clearly have a local\npresence , no enforcement action can practically be taken against them . \n\n \n\nOfficials claim they are confident that once the bill is passed ,\nbetting with overseas bookmakers will decline because banks and credit card\ncentres will be stopped from processing betting-related transactions . \n\n \n\nThese financial intermediaries are not known to have protested\nagainst the bill yet .\n\n\nBut can they be expected to know the real identities of account\nholders who might be overseas bookmakers ? \n\n \n\nPresumably , the Government wants the bill passed before the\nWorld Cup kicks off on May 31 , when illegal soccer gambling is expected to\nsurge . \n\n \n\nFor as long as Hong Kong maintains its policy of allowing betting\nonly on horse races organised by the Hong Kong Jockey Club and the Mark Six\nlottery held by the Hong Kong Lotteries Board , officials have no choice but\nto plug holes that have allowed betting revenue to go overseas . \n\n \n\nBut there is really no difference between betting on a horse race\nand betting on a soccer match .\n\n\nNor should a distinction be made between betting with a local or\noverseas bookmaker .\n\n\nTrying to protect the revenue of local bookmakers is a dubious\nargument for rooting out overseas betting syndicates because it amounts to a\nrestriction of trade . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Time for sincerity  \n\n \n\nNorth Korea  ' s on-again , off-again attempts at dialogue with the\noutside world have provoked as much hope as exasperation .\n\n\n\" Sincere &rdquo; is a word rarely used by once-reclusive\nleader Kim Jong-il and his diplomats , but it is hoped they now adopt it as\ntheir catch-cry . \n\n \n\nToo often , the North has pulled back at crucial times in\nnegotiations .\n\n\nWhether by design or due to genuine misgivings , the tired pattern\nhas led to only scepticism by those involved . \n\n \n\nAnother door of optimism has been opened by Mr Kim  ' s acceptance\nof an offer to reopen talks with the United States and his promise to visit\nSeoul for talks with his South Korean counterpart , Kim Dae-jung .\n\n\nReunions of families split by the division of the Korean peninsula 50\nyears ago will resume . \n\n \n\nThere was similar optimism two years ago when talks in Pyongyang\nbetween the Kims were announced . \n\n \n\nThe historic visit opened North Korea to the world and the\nthought of reunification went from being an impossible dream to a possibility .\n\n\n \n\nBut within a year , those thoughts had turned to familiar\nanimosity and distrust .\n\n\nUS President George W . Bush  ' s January labelling of North Korea as\npart of an \" axis of evil &rdquo; along with Iran and Iraq hammered in\nthe final nail . \n\n \n\nSouth Korean presidential envoy Lim Dong-won last week breathed\nnew life into the process after three days of talks in Pyongyang .\n\n\nHe has convinced Kim Jong-il that nothing is to be gained from\nmaintaining an insular attitude . \n\n \n\nFace-to-face talks are the only way that tensions on the\npeninsula can be calmed or concerns about Pyongyang  ' s nuclear and missile\nprogrammes can be dealt with . \n\n \n\nBut it is up to North Korea to remain engaged and not back off as\nit has numerous times before .\n\n\nIf it truly wants to become a member of the world community , it must\nshow dedication . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Party political crisis  \n\n \n\nA poll that found 53 per cent of the public do not think any of\nthe SAR  ' s political parties can represent them should set the alarm bells\nringing for the parties .\n\n\nWhat is so worrying about the figure is that it is the culmination of\na trend that clearly shows an increasing number of people have lost\nconfidence in them . \n\n \n\nThe Chinese University  ' s Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies has\nbeen tracking public support of political parties for more than five years\nnow . When the first poll was conducted in 1996 , only 35.6 per cent could\nnot name a political party that could best represent their interests . \n\n \n\nUnder the Basic Law , political parties have a limited role to\nplay in running Hong Kong .\n\n\nBarred from forming the Government , the best they can hope to\nachieve is to win as many seats as possible in the legislature so they can\nbecome a powerful opposition to the Government . \n\n \n\nYet although they do not govern , those legislators - and the\nparties behind them - who are returned by popular elections can claim to be\nrepresentatives of the people .\n\n\nIndeed , it is this electoral legitimacy which distinguishes them\nfrom the Chief Executive , who is returned only by an 800-member Election\nCommittee and presides over an unelected administration . \n\n \n\nNow the polls have called into question the notion that our\npolitical parties can represent the popular will . \n\n \n\nThe pollsters warn that the political parties even face being\nsidelined if the \" ministers &rdquo; to be appointed by Chief Executive Tung\nChee-hwa in July under the new principal officials accountability system\nsucceed in wooing the public with their fresh image and shoring up support\nfor the Government . \n\n \n\nIt remains to be seen whether that will pose a danger to the\nparties .\n\n\nBut an even bigger concern is that the ministers ' success , should it\nbecome reality , may boost the argument that democracy is not all that\nimportant after all . \n\n \n\nHistory has shown that Hong Kong people are largely a compliant\nlot .\n\n\nThey had no qualms in throwing their support behind unelected\ncolonial governors as long as the latter were seen to be doing and saying the\nright thing . \n\n \n\nFor the sake of their own survival and the further development of\ndemocracy , it is time the political parties reflected on the reasons behind\ntheir plunging popularity and tried better to articulate the public will .\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Voices of caution  \n\n \n\nDespite the rhetoric from the White House suggesting military\naction to topple the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein , there are welcome signs\nthat the US , and its close ally Britain , are not planning precipitate\naction . \n\n \n\nBritish officials , who will most certainly be involved along\nwith their US counterparts in any military action , have let it be known that\nany possible armed intervention is likely to be at least a year away .\n\n\nIn the meantime , both countries appear to have taken the sensible\noption of trying to get UN weapons inspectors back into Iraq .\n\n\nSaddam Hussein is without doubt one of the most unpleasant rulers in\nthe world today .\n\n\nBut this does not justify the United States and Britain taking the\nlaw into their own hands and taking military action to topple him because the\nleaders of these two countries do not like him . \n\n \n\nThe two countries have threatened military actions on the grounds\nthat Saddam has stockpiled weapons of mass destruction and is a threat to\nworld peace .\n\n\nThere seems little doubt that Iraq has chemical and probably\nbiological weapons .\n\n\nBut this is nothing new . Iraq has used chemical weapons such as\nmustard gas against its own restive minorities , as well as during the\nIran-Iraq war more than two decades ago .\n\n\nThe West was at that time quite happy to court him and to use him as\na bulwark against a radical Iranian regime . \n\n \n\nWhy has he suddenly become a threat to peace in the region and\nthe world ?\n\n\nAnd if he were indeed such a threat , should not Iraq  ' s neighbours ,\nmost of whom have no love for the Iraqi leader , not be the first to clamour\nfor military action ?\n\n\nInstead , there is an overwhelming demand from the region that\nWashington and London keep out .\n\n\nMr Bush and Mr Blair would do well to heed the voices of caution from\nthe Middle East . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n A growing burden  \n\n \n\nHong Kong does not have a properly funded pension scheme that\nguarantees a basic standard of living for all retirees .\n\n\nBut the financially destitute can apply for help under the\nComprehensive Social Security Assistance scheme , and more than 100,000\nsenior citizens have done so . \n\n \n\nYet , out of a desire to maintain their dignity , many poor\nelderly people are known to have opted not to apply for CSSA payments .\n\n\nInstead , they choose to survive on odd jobs , supplementing their\nincome with the several hundred dollars they get under the Old Age Allowance\nscheme - &dollar;625 a month for those aged 65 and &dollar;705 for those\nabove 70 . \n\n \n\nMany elderly citizens who do not qualify for CSSA because they\nlive with their families , but are not getting much pocket money from their\nchildren , also find the allowance a precious source of income .\n\n\nBut the problem with the scheme is that it is largely\nnon-means-tested .\n\n\nWhile recipients aged between 65 and 70 cannot have savings of more\nthan &dollar;150,000 , no such restrictions apply for those aged above 70 .\n\n\n \n\nLast year , some 457,000 recipients of the allowance collected a\ntotal of &dollar;3.56 billion - a financial burden on the Government that\nwill only grow as the elderly population increases .\n\n\nClearly , far too many elderly people who probably do not need the\nallowance are getting it .\n\n\nIf we take the view that payments from the public coffers should only\ngo to the needy , then a strong case could be made for introducing a tougher\nmeans test to weed out most of the recipients of the allowance so the money\nsaved could be spent elsewhere . \n\n \n\nBut since it was introduced some 30 years ago , the allowance has\ncome to be seen as a reward for senior citizens ' past contribution to the\ncommunity , and the public clearly want it to remain that way .\n\n\nThe challenge for the Government is to find the money to meet the\nscheme  ' s ever-growing demand for cash , by pointing out there is no such\nthing as a free lunch and that the allowance as it is can only be sustained\nby higher taxes . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n A question of trust \n\n \n\nThe controversy over the environmental damage caused by\nconstruction work for the Disney project at Penny  ' s Bay continues with the\nconfirmation by an independent expert that dredging and reclamation work was\nresponsible for the death of fish at two farms in the area . \n\n \n\nDespite earlier government claims to the contrary , a report by\nDaniel Chan Kwong-on of the University of Hong Kong has found that sediment\ncaused by dredging in Penny  ' s Bay did cause the death of at least several\ntens of thousands of fish at the Ma Wan and Cheung Sha Wan fish farms . \n\n \n\nThe Government  ' s response to this report is not known yet but ,\nsince it commissioned the study , it is presumably bound to accept its\nrecommendation of compensation for the loss of fish stocks . \n\n \n\nIn what has now become a familiar pattern , the Government\ninitially denied that the dredging work for the Disney site had anything to\ndo with the death of fish in the nearby farms .\n\n\nThen , after a public outcry , it agreed to an independent\ninvestigation , which proves that dredging has had an adverse impact . \n\n \n\nIn a similar vein , the extent of poisonous waste at the Cheoy\nLee shipyard was overlooked in the early planning stages , and now the public\nis faced with a clean-up bill of up to &dollar;450 million .\n\n\nIt has also agreed to contact workers at the old shipyard to see if\nthey have been affected by the dioxin that lay buried there . \n\n \n\nFew people dispute that the Disney project is good for Hong Kong\nand will bring economic benefits to the territory .\n\n\nBut when such projects are planned , the Government should learn to\nbe more trusting and open with the public about the true costs that are\ninvolved . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Laying out the changes  \n\n \n\nAfter days of conflicting reports in the media , officials have\nfinally cleared the air by laying out the structure of the new accountability\nsystem for principal officials . \n\n \n\nA major surprise in the blueprint unveiled yesterday is that the\npost of Secretary for Civil Service will be filled by a political appointee .\n\n\nWhile the appointee must be from within the civil service , he or\nshe , once appointed , will cease to be a civil servant and be accountable to\nthe Chief Executive like other ministers . \n\n \n\nPreviously , it was thought that the Secretary for Civil Service\nwould remain a civil servant so that he could look after the interests of the\ncivil service and protect its integrity . \n\n \n\nThe decision to make the bearer of this office a political\nappointee is a recognition of the fact that any policy on the civil service\nis by its very nature a political one .\n\n\nAlso , the implementation of the accountability system would not be\ncomplete if the Secretary for Civil Service could not be removed for failing\nto push through the Chief Executive  ' s agenda . \n\n \n\nThe system  ' s new command structure , which provides that all\nthe ministers be directly accountable to the Chief Executive , could prove\nembarrassing for the Chief Secretary and the Financial Secretary .\n\n\nTraditionally , each is in charge of a number of policy areas with\nthe bureau chiefs concerned reporting to the Chief Executive through them .\n\n\n \n\nAlthough the new structure still recognises the seniority of the\nChief Secretary , Financial Secretary and Secretary for Justice , and the\nthree will continue to receive higher pay , their clout over other ministers\nand whether they will be bypassed by the latter is expected to be dependent\non their personal relationship with the Chief Executive . \n\n \n\nChanges are unsettling .\n\n\nIt will take time for senior civil servants , particularly members\nof the administrative service who form the backbone of the administration and\nhave been playing dual roles as both departmental administrators and\npolicy-makers , to get used to working under political appointees ,\nparticularly those from outside the civil service . \n\n \n\nBut the adaptation process will be helped by the fact that most\nof Mr Tung Chee-hwa  ' s first batch of ministers are expected to be drawn\nfrom among the existing policy secretaries who are civil servants .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "50cf288f-7cbb-47a8-9603-dbe45ae14e20", "added":

{"text": "destress call   \n\n\n getting arty   \n\n\n text &ampersand; pictures: monster   \n\n \n\n We all have creative moments but making more of your inner\nartist by attending a class provides a relaxing escape from working life and\n, as an added bonus , you can walk away from a course with something to\ndecorate your home or send to your mother .  \n\n \n\n\" Art is a tart ! &rdquo; , I once read on a postcard .\n\n\nAnd while it  ' s certainly true that in Hong Kong most creative courses\nseem to attract more women than men , you guys really shouldn't get left\nbehind .\n\n\nGetting in touch with your feminine side is a necessary accomplishment\nfor all 21st century self-respecting blokes .\n\n\nAfter all , macram\u00e9 is the new golf , and being able to make a tissue\nbox cover out of loo rolls , old shirts , ribbons and doilies looks great on\nyou CV , not to mention the back shelf of your BMW . \n\n \n\nSo  Winners  bravely went where few men have gone before\nand met some good looking , bloke-friendly , hot-to-trot evening  ' s\nentertainment .\n\n\nAnd the courses aren't bad either...  \n\n\n Life is what We Make It  \n\n \n\nLearning to depict the human figure takes you at once to the most\nbasic necessities and yet most enduring complex tasks of drawing .\n\n\nYou don't have to read the  Karma Sutra  (  although you\nmight like to for - ahem - research purposes ) to know there is an infinite\nnumber of positions the human body can get knotted up into . \n\n \n\nSo there you are , sitting in a cosy relaxed studio with your\nsketchpad on your knees and apiece of charcoal in your hand , and suddenly a\nmodel walks in , starkers .\n\n\nAfter your eyes have stopped widening at the fact that you have a\nlive nude person in front of you without the pay-to-view channel on , force\nyours hands down from your mouth , silencing your gasp (  or back from under\nyour sketch pad... ) , and shakily pick up your drawing implement from where\nit has fallen on the floor .\n\n\nNow you have to regain eye-hand coordination and start sketching .\n\n\n\" Draw what you see , not what you know , &rdquo; says Norm Yip\n, artist , architect and photographer , who holds the life drawing sessions\nat his studio - Studio 8 .\n\n\n\" Break free of perceptions of what something is supposed to look\nlike . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nIt  ' s difficult , it  ' s a challenge , but at the same time it is\nquiet and therapeutic and the best thing is that you don't have to get it\nright .\n\n\nThere is no pressure .\n\n\n\" Don't try to make a Picasso , &rdquo; warns Norm .\n\n\nNo one but you need see your attempts and you  ' ll find after a few\nwarm-up exercises you get more confident and soon you  ' ll be throwing out\npictures of slightly alien looking hybrid forms of the human being with gusto .\n\n\n \n\nJohn McArthur , a teacher , has been taking lessons at Studio 8\nfor a while.\n\n\n\" A life session is a little like an artistic workout , &rdquo;\nhe said .\n\n\n\" For me it is total relaxation - meditation for the want of a\nbetter way .\n\n\nNothing else matters when you are involved in the drawing process .\n\n\nEverything is form , shape and smudged shades on paper .\n\n\nHopefully when I have finished it is something that makes sense to me .\n&rdquo;   \n\n\n Life Drawing Tips  \n\n \n\n? Start by picking out geometric shapes just to get the essence .\n\n\n \n\n? Then try moving your hand very fast in scratchy strokes .\n\n\nWherever your eye goes make your hand go . \n\n \n\n? Try contour drawing: follow a line very slowly and draw without\npicking your pencil up off the paper , or even looking to see what you are\ndoing .\n\n\nThis trains the eye to be more sensitive . \n\n \n\n? Don't try to make your sketch perfect . \n\n \n\n? Don't let a drawing control you; you control it .  \n\n\n Paints , Music , Wine , Action !  \n\n \n\nFor a riotous Saturday night unlike any you have had before ,\ntake your normal weekend night out , and to the staple ingredients of alcohol\n, music and friendly banter with the ever-present hope of some steamy action\nlater on , and just add paint . \n\n \n\nTony Smyth and friends , in one corner of the packed Meli Melo\ngallery have come to Art Jam for the first time .\n\n\nNervously looking at his blank canvas Smyth tells me how he feels .\n\n\n\" You  ' ll have to find a synonym for shitting yourself !\n&rdquo; he laughs , adding , \" we were finding inspiration in Dublin\nJacks until a few moments ago . &rdquo;\n\n\nAcross the room , Gallant Nein , an accountant , has been dragged\nalong by a female friend who is a regular  ' art jammer ' .\n\n\nWhile she deftly paints a professional-looking abstract number which\nto my untrained eye could easily sell for thousands in the right frame and\nright gallery , he is painting something rather different .\n\n\n\" I  ' m not going for beauty , &rdquo; he understates\ndisarmingly .\n\n\n\" This is the best way to describe what  ' s been on my mind\nrecently - personal emotions , and voices I  ' m dealing with right now .\n\n\nIt  ' s a way of thinking - thinking on canvas , and that  ' s why it  ' s\nsuch a good release . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nAt first it  ' s hard to let go of the conventional desire to\ncreate something as perfect as possible but here , with an unlimited amount\nof paint (  and wine ) , as the evening progresses it doesn't matter if you are\nfinishing your very first masterpiece or on your tenth layer of paint .\n\n\nIt  ' s all about flinging your hands in the air and having fun , and\nif that means getting more paint on yourself and your friends than the canvas\n, then go ahead ! \n\n \n\nSo popular now , these evenings are often completely full so make\nsure you book ahead of time .\n\n\nIt seems everyone wants to create their own piece of art .\n\n\nSmyth has painted an fawn-coloured abstract for his dogs , the same\ncolour as the carpet they love to chew .\n\n\nHe stands back and admires it .\n\n\n\" Now what I want to know is how do get into a taxi with one of\nthese ? &rdquo;  \n\n\n How to Art Jam  \n\n \n\n? Don't rush into anything .\n\n\nThink about what you want to create before slapping the paint on .\n\n\n \n\n? Don't take it too seriously .\n\n\nNo one is judging you , so have fun . \n\n \n\n? Use a plastic scraper as well as or instead of a brush for a\ndifferent effect . \n\n \n\n? If it doesn't turn out how you wanted it , come back and try\nagain another time . \n\n \n\n? Hey , why not try painting with the red wine just to see what\nhappens ?\n\n\nOne sip for you .\n\n\nOne splash for the canvas .   \n\n\n Getting to Grips with Clay  \n\n \n\n? Relax , enjoy the feeling of the clay and getting messy . \n\n \n\n? With hand-building you can make anything at all , look for\ninspiration from the objects around you . \n\n \n\n? Be calm and have a steady hand for throwing . \n\n \n\n? Painting on a coloured or multi-coloured glaze on a finished\npiece is an art in itself . \n\n \n\n? The result relies on the temperature of the kiln and the\nthickness of the glaze .\n\n\nYou can't always control it - which is part of the fun .\n\n\nSo be prepared for the unexpected !  \n\n\n Going to Pot  \n\n \n\n Ghost  it  ' s not , and anyway Patrick Swazi is soooo\nEighties - in fact , to begin with , it  ' ll be more Robert de Niro  ' s\nlaughable attempts at crockery creation in  Showtime  .\n\n\nBut don't despair .\n\n\nQueenie at the Pottery Workshop is there to lend an encouraging word\nand help you find your inner potter .\n\n\nIn any case there  ' s no need to panic , the creative moment is\ndelayed by some good old-fashioned physical hard work .\n\n\nWedging and pinching , coiling and slab - building , may sound like\nyou should be on a building site with your trousers half way down your arse\nand hobnail boots on - but this is where pottery gets macho .\n\n\nTo begin with you have to wedge or work the clay to make it pliable\nenough to shape before you can talk the terms that refer to creative output -\nmaking that wobbly bowl , lop-sided ashtray or three-legged dog that you can\ngive your auntie for her birthday .\n\n\nThrowing , or using the wheel , is for later when you have a feel for\nthe clay . Eddie Lui , product designer , did pottery at college and has\nrecently taken it up again .\n\n\nHe loves the challenge of producing a piece and finds the flexibility\nof clay fun .\n\n\n\" But most importantly it  ' s another world to go into , &rdquo;\nhe says .\n\n\n\" Although there are other people there , when you are doing\nyour piece you don't see them .\n\n\nYou are in your own world .\n\n\nIt  ' s very relaxing and inspiring . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nLooking round the room three are indeed a few strange things\namong the breathtakingly professional looking bottles , vases and bowls that\nyou might be aspiring to .\n\n\n\" There are so many possibilities in working with clay .\n\n\nMore than with throwing where you are confined by the wheel , so you\ncan't make strange organic forms , &rdquo; Queenie explains , reading my mind .\n\n\n\" It is fun to make something and then take it home and use it .\n&rdquo;\n\n\nOr let it collect dust , I think to myself of my own heroic attempts .\n \n\n\n Focusing on Photography  \n\n \n\nImprove your pictures immediately by: ? Understanding the\ncontrols of your camera . \n\n \n\n? Pre-visualising .\n\n\nSee the result you want in your imagination , eg . - how to express a\ntree: in sharp detail or with blur from the wind ? \n\n \n\n? Using light correctly by being aware of the different effects\nit has depending on which angle you are looking/shooting form . \n\n \n\n? Concentrating on the composition .\n\n\nThere is never just one picture of something of someone .\n\n\nMove around and change the angles . \n\n \n\n? Getting in close and looking at details .  \n\n\n Snap Happy  \n\n \n\nIn Hong Kong the important things in life are the sleekest\nsports cars , the fastest laptops and the finest mobiles , right ?\n\n\nNever get between a man and his gadgets , as they say .\n\n\nBut in photography , having a billion mega-pixels isn't necessarily\ngoing to get you the best picture , so said Henri Cartier Bresson back in the\nearly 1900s (  well , perhaps not in quite the same words ) and so says\nDominique Harris now . \n\n \n\nThe Hong Kong-born photographer has been into photography since\nshe was a teenager when she was toting a completely manual camera , \"\nno auto-focus , I had to do everything , &rdquo; she explains .\n\n\n\" These days most people use their camera  ' in programme ' but\nyou end up with pictures that are averaged out - factory designed - because\npeople have no idea what the camera is doing .\n\n\nThe key is to work in manual and take control .\n\n\nIt  ' s easy to master . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nShe holds classes at the Island School Evening Institute and the\nHong Kong Arts Centre covering basic technicalities and darkroom techniques\nto start with and then going on to encourage people to be creative .\n\n\n\" Anyone can take a picture - it  ' s just creating ones that\nare more memorable , &rdquo; she says .\n\n\n\" See a scene and replicate your impression rather than just\nrecording it .\n\n\nPlay with depth of field , movement , light . &rdquo;  \n\n\n Five Inspiration Snappers  \n\n \n\nLocal photographer Dominique Harris recommends a look at: ?\nHenri Cartier Bresson - granddaddy of black-and-white documentary photography .\n\n\nEveryone knows his famous kiss shot . \n\n \n\n? Garry Winogrand - American photojournalist renowned for his  ' uncomposed'\ncontemporary life shots . \n\n \n\n? Emmett Gowin - best known for large format spontaneous family\nphotographs . \n\n \n\n? Joel Mawrowitz - street photographer and pioneer of colour\nphotography . \n\n \n\n? Cindy Sherman - voyeuristic pictures with a feeling of film\nstills . \n\n \n\nMagnus Ng , a former student , is hooked .\n\n\n\" After the course , I found that photography opportunities\nactually exist all around us and in our daily life .\n\n\nNow I usually carry a small camera with me everywhere so as not to\nmiss a photo opportunity.\"\n\n\nHe went on , \" the course encouraged me to try street\nphotography and black-and-white photography which I had never attempted\nbefore .\n\n\nI framed some of the pictures I took and hung them up at home .\n\n\nI really like being able to always see my pictures when I get back\nfrom work . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nSo if you don't want to end up with a whole album of hit-or-miss\nsnaps after your next trip to Bali , or your family picnic or weekend hike ,\nthen make your history memorable and learn how to take real works of art .\n \n\n\n Sharpening Artistic Awareness  \n\n \n\n? Look around you . Artists get inspiration from their\nenvironment , nature , people , everything . \n\n \n\n? Visit some art galleries; try walking along Hollywood Rd. ,\nwhere numerous commercial galleries are happy for you to look around . \n\n \n\n? Really look art pieces; analyse what you like and don't like\nabout them .\n\n\nThis will make it easier for you to produce something you like\nyourself . \n\n \n\n? Be proactive .\n\n\nInstead of being a couch potato get up and go out with a camera or\npaper and pen and experiment . \n\n \n\n? There  ' s no wrong or right in art .\n\n\nRules are made to be broken and mistakes may lead to the most\ninteresting pieces of all .  \n\n\n Exposing Your Stuff  \n\n \n\nArranging an exhibition is not the preserve of a professional\nartist .\n\n\nThere are plenty of spaces around town where you have your own show\nor a group show with a few art classmates .\n\n\nSome of the main ones are listed below .\n\n\nSetting yourself the goal of an exhibition will give you the extra\nmotivation to get stuck into your artwork and not skip classes . \n\n \n\nThe Foreign Correspondent  ' s Club (  FCC ) , 2 Lower Albert Rd ,\nCentral , Tel: 2521 1551 holds their annual FCC Photographer of the Year\nAwards .\n\n\nThere are categories for non-professional photographers as well as\nprofessionals .\n\n\nEntries are usually required by the end of the year and judged in\nJan of the following year so there is plenty of time to get practising .\n\n\nCheck www.fcchk.org or email poya@fcchk.org for details . \n\n \n\nPara-Site Art Space , 2 Po Yan St , Sheung Wan , Tel: 2790 5275\nhas an annual call for proposals for shows .\n\n\nIf you think your work merits looking at try applying .\n\n\nCheck out www.para/site.org.hk/ or call for more details . \n\n \n\nMeli Melo Living Arts Caf\u00e9 (  for address see box on opposite\npage ) supports lesser known or emerging artists by offering concessionary\nexhibition space where anyone can put on their own show .\n\n\nZen + City is a public exhibition gallery for rent for &dollar;500 a\nday , minimum 5 days plus &dollar;500 deposit (  basically &dollar;3,000 per\nweek ) .\n\n\nCall Lisa Kirkpatrick on 2581 3600 for details or look at\nwww.melimelohk.net/zen/zen_home.htm . \n\n \n\nThe Fringe Club , 2 Lower Albert Rd , Central , Tel: 2521 1511\nhas a few small exhibition spaces and members (  &dollar;300 per year ) can\napply to set up a show there .\n\n\nYou can pick up an application form at the front desk .\n\n\nThe Fringe takes 30% commission on any sales .\n\n\nThere is also a meeting on the first Thurs of each month where a\nphotographer gives a talk , Check  SCMP  listings for details . \n\n \n\nThe Cathay Camera Club (  call Billy Leung on 9200 2934 ) is the\nonly English-language photography club in Hong Kong ,\nmembers.tripod.com/~cathayccc/aboutus.html\n\n\nIt meets on twice a month 7:30pm at the Mariner  ' s Club , Middle Rd\n, TST .\n\n\nThe club features monthly competitions , speakers , an annual\nexhibition and field trips .\n\n\nMembership is &dollar;500 per year .

for\nspeed skating . \n\n \n\nHow is the University of Hong Kong and how about your friends and\nteachers ?\n\n\nHow about your school life ? \n\n\nGot to go .\n\n\nTake care .\n\n\nWrite me as soon as possible .\n\n\nBonnie \n\n\n\n\n17.9.92\n\n\nDear Alexandra ,\n\n \n\nHow  ' s it going ?\n\n\nHow are you enjoying your life at the university ?\n\n\nHaven't learned from you for a while , I hope school life is better\nthan the work life you mentioned in the summer .\n\n\nSorry I haven't written you since your letter in the summer ,\n\n\nI was busy with my school work ,\n\n\nas you know it is my last year of schooling and the workload is very\nheavy .\n\n\nThe other reasons is I  ' m very busy . \n\n \n\nMy fall semester went by very fast .\n\n\nA lot more individual work than last year .\n\n\nFinally , the last year of school , but I found it very difficult to\nget motivated and get things done right now ,\n\n\nall I want to do is SLEEP !\n\n\nMaybe , I  ' m just getting old .\n\n\nWhat about you ?\n\n\nHow are your courses ?\n\n\nDoes university life meet up to your expectation ? \n\n \n\nSo far , job search hasn't been successful for me .\n\n\nRight now , I  ' m still facing the discussion of where I want to work\n&semi; but really , I haven't thought much about it since I got back .\n\n\nThe career prospect in Calgary seems grimmer and grimmer each day\n-;\n\n\neven one of the major Chartered Banks are laying off people . \n\n \n\nWhat are your plans for Christmas ?\n\n\nHow are you going to celebrate your birthday .\n\n\nAnyhow , I better get going .\n\n\nTake Care ,\n\n\nI am waiting anxiously to hear from you .\n\n\nHappy Birthday !\n\n\nAll the best in the years to come !\n\n\nEnclosed is a picture I promised you . \n\n\nMerry Christmas &ampersand;

a few days ago .\n\n\nMay be it  ' s too late at night ( around 12 pm HK time\n) ,\n\n\nthe man who answered the phone seemed to be very rude and he hang up\nbefore I could leave a message to you . \n\n \n\nHow do you like Australia ?\n\n\nWhich part of Australia did you visit ?\n\n\nYou are very welcomed to come and visit the States with or without\nyour boyfriend .\n\n\nYou can stay in our place for as long as you want .\n\n\nWe are planning to move to the east coast in summer .\n\n\nIf you really plan to come here next year , you won't be bored .\n\n\nThere are more to see in the east coast than the Midwest .\n\n\nWe  ' ll move either to Washington , D.C. or Boston , but more likely\nto the D.C. area .\n\n\nBy the way , we may visit H.K. next year Christmas .\n\n\nA long wait though ! \n\n \n\nI  ' m happy to hear that you have a plan for your future .\n\n\nI  ' m not sure whether you mean quitting your job and study full time\nfor a Law degree or just continue going for part time .\n\n\nWhichever way you choose , I  ' m sure that if you have the abilities\nand education , you will be very employable anywhere .\n\n\nAfter I have been in the States for a while , I realize that those\nwho are unemployed here are mostly people who have low skill and low\neducation .\n\n\nThose who have the knowledge and information are usually handsomely\npaid for their job .\n\n\nGo for your plan !\n\n\n  Hard work  will be paid off in future , I  ' m\nsure . \n\n \n\nHowever I can share some of my experience with you .\n\n\nI think the love between men and women is the most fragile kind of\nlove in the world .\n\n\nParental love is unconditional and uncalculating .\n\n\nParents won't think about how much they can get back from the child\nbefore they give their love .\n\n\nMoreover the love between friends is not as demanding as the love\nbetween men and women .\n\n\nMy point is that if one can love the other person without calculate\nwhat one can get back from the relationship , this will be the greatest love\nof all .\n\n\nIt will be closer to the parental love .\n\n\nRemember a verse about love in Corinthian II in the New Testament ,\n\n\nit says all about the uncalculating nature of love .\n\n\nIf you can love someone like that you will feel more secure because\nyou won't be scared of losing someone  ' s love in future .\n\n\nLove is giving , not taking ! \n\n \n\nIn my opinion , you should be careful in choosing the right\nperson rather settling for the second best .\n\n\nYou have to use your own instinct and judgement to evaluate the\nperson .\n\n\nI sincerely hope to attend your marriage ceremony in the near future !\n\n\nThough marriage is the only hope of happiness for women , it is an\nimportant stage in one  ' s life experiences .\n\n\nFrom my own experiences , though there are a lot of obstacles in my\nmarriage relationship   with  Bob , I think my life has\nbeen enriched .\n\n\n  after all  life is full of obstacles ,\nisn't it ?\n\n\nI hope I have given you some inspiration in your decision-making\nregarding your relationship   with  your boyfriend . \n\n \n\nI am doing pretty well in the States .\n\n\nI have settled and got used to the environment .\n\n\nI did not follow through the application of the Master degree in\nUniversity of Maryland .\n\n\nI decide to go for a Ph.D in sociology instead .\n\n\nI will apply for 6 universities and hope to be accepted for one of\ntheir Ph.D programs .\n\n\nHowever if I  ' m not able   to  get the\nassistantship as what I  ' m having now , I  ' ll probably find a job in the\nstatistical analysis and research area .\n\n\nI  ' m now busy with my thesis .\n\n\nMy thesis topic is on the causes of persistent poverty in America .\n\n\nIt makes me more conscious of the upward mobility of myself in the\neconomic and social stratification in American society . \n\n\nThanks again for your card !\n\n\nHope you  ' ll receive my Christmas parcel soon ! \n\n\n\n\nDECEMBER 4 , 1993\n\n\nDEAR SHIRLEY ,\n\n \n\nHI , WHAT  ' s UP ?\n\n\nIT  ' s ME AGAIN , REALLY AGAIN .\n\n\nYOU SAID YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHY WE BOTH WROTE BACK SO QUICKLY .\n\n\nI CAN TELL YOU WHY .\n\n\nIT  ' s MAINLY BECAUSE OF OUR \" MAIN THEME &rdquo;

{"text": "Outbreak brings about telecoms innovation   \n\n\n Ben Kwok  \n\n \n\nThe severe acute respiratory syndrome (  Sars ) may have hurt local\nmobile operators ' profitability , but not their creativity . \n\n \n\nOperators have sought to turn adversity into a business\nopportunity , pitching new-generation data services when information has\ntaken on extraordinary importance . \n\n \n\nIn a city where 91 per cent of the population has a mobile-phone\n, many users rely on handsets to access Sars-related information , check\ncorporate e-mail , and when riding the bus home surrounded by wearisome\nmask-clad commuters , hopefully provide some entertainment . \n\n \n\nSunday Communications , Hong Kong  ' s smallest operator , is\nproviding a location-based service that identifies Sars-designated buildings\nwithin a 1 km radius of the caller . \n\n \n\n\" In the first two days , we had over 10,000 inquiries ,\n&rdquo; Sunday director Henry Wong Kam-heng said . \n\n \n\nSuch has been the public fear , bordering on hysteria , that\ndemand for information on affected areas has been huge . \n\n \n\nSunday is betting this same thirst for location services will\noutlive the need to know whether you are within 1 km of Sars .\n\n\nTo date , demand for location precision has been disappointing , with\na Sunday service pin-pointing petrol stations and car-repair centres ,\nattracting few users . \n\n \n\nMobile e-mail use has surged since the crisis and operators such\nas SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings hope the habit endures . \n\n \n\nSince launching six months ago , SmarTone said it had signed up\ncompanies such as MTR Corp , banks and professional firms . \n\n \n\nEmployees working from home as a result of the large-scale office\nshutdowns means the dependence on remote devices for work communication is\ngrowing . \n\n \n\nThe message has not been lost on the government , which quashed a\nrumour that Hong Kong was about to be declared an infected port by asking the\nsix operators to send millions of messages denying the bogus story .\n\n\nThat kicked off a chain of free SMS offers giving updates on Sars .\n\n\nNew World Mobility marketing director Melanie Lee said 5 per cent of\nsubscribers agreed to receive free Sars-related messages . \n\n \n\nWith an increased interest in mobile data , New World launched a\nservice with Emperor Entertainment Group featuring teen idols . \n\n \n\nThis may be the future , but for now , operators are getting a\nboost from an unexpected source . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Pentax passes the portability test   \n\n\n RAYMOND MA  \n\n \n\n Product:  Pentax Optio S \n\n \n\n<bold . Pros:    3.2 megapixel capacity , 3x optical zoom\n, compact \n\n \n\n Cons:  Images can shift to yellow , rather pricey\n\n\n \n\n Price:  HK&dollar;3,400 \n\n \n\nThe first thing one notices about the Pentax Optio S is its size .\n\n\nPentax boasts on its Web site that the camera is small enough to fit\ninto a can of Altoids . \n\n \n\nHaving lived in Hong Kong all my life , I have no idea what an\nAltoid is , but the point is taken , and the camera is very small for the\nnumber of functions it can perform . \n\n \n\nAt 8.3x5x2cm , the Optio S is probably on the bulky side compared\nwith other ultra-compact cameras , notably the Casio Exilim S and M series ,\nwhich are about half as thick . \n\n \n\nBut bear in mind that the Optio S packs in a 3x optical zoom ,\nwhich probably makes up much of the added bulk . \n\n \n\nIn terms of picture quality , Pentax digital camera images\ngenerally tend to shift towards yellow and those from the Optio S are no\nexception - especially in low light conditions - although to a lesser extent\nthan with previous models . \n\n \n\nFor more accurate colour rendering , the Olympus Stylus 300\nDigital is probably a better bet , but the camera is twice as thick . \n\n \n\nIts 3.2-megapixel capability is also at the cutting edge of what\nis available in ultra-compact models at present .\n\n\nHowever , watch out for the Stylus 300  ' s sibling , which should\navailable soon and will have a four-megapixel capability . \n\n \n\nBesides having the standard pre-set modes for better night-time\nphotos , scenery and self portraits , the Optio S also has the ability to\ntake panoramas and 3D pictures .\n\n\nIt comes with a set of filters , including those for black-and-white\nand colour-tinted images .\n\n\nOne filter that can make images appear fatter or thinner should be\npopular with kids . \n\n \n\nIt can record up to 30 seconds of digital video , which is not\nbad for an ultra-compact digital still camera . \n\n \n\nUltra-compact cameras are about size and functions , and the\nPentax Optio S walks a fine line between portability and functionality . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Health crisis demonstrates the true potential of IT \n \n\n \n\n POINT OF VIEW  \n\n \n\nSin Chung-kai \n\n \n\nThe outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (  Sars ) has\nfar-reaching implications for the information technology industry in Hong\nKong . \n\n \n\nWith normal business activities disrupted by travel restrictions\n, schools closed , shops empty and everyone relying on information from the\nhealth authorities to check on the spread of the virus , the Sars outbreak\noffers us a chance to recognise the unique nature of IT and the role it has\nto play in our society . \n\n \n\nThe Internet enables our children to keep learning by connecting\nthem with schools as classes remain suspended . \n\n \n\nThe government has been using e-public services to allay fears\nand keep citizens updated on the disease .\n\n\nLocal enterprises have set up virtual offices to avoid the virus\nspreading in physical offices . \n\n \n\nE-commerce systems have also enabled buyers and suppliers\noverseas to manage transactions in Hong Kong in the face of travel bans .\n\n\nAlternative ways of doing business , such as video-conferencing and\nordering via e-mail , have enabled companies to keep losses minimal .\n\n\nThanks to the Internet , business in Hong Kong has been affected less\nseverely than it might have been . \n\n \n\nn the middle of the Sars crisis , the IT industry has leveraged\ntechnological capabilities to ease the difficulties . \n\n \n\nThe Hong Kong Computer Society and Microsoft Hong Kong have set\nup a Work@Home programme to help companies create and run mobile work\nenvironments . \n\n \n\nThe Internet Professionals Association will set up an online\nportal in an effort to boost the image of Hong Kong in the worldwide\ncommunity . \n\n \n\nThe Internet and Telecom Association of Hong Kong is donating\nvideo-conferencing equipment to hospitals so that patients suffering from\natypical pneumonia and the medical staff caring for them can keep in touch\nwith relatives . \n\n \n\nThe outbreak has underscored that IT is a tool that gives people\nand companies greater control over uncertainty , both in business and our\neveryday lives . \n\n \n\nBut we know that it can work even better . \n\n \n\nThe decisive role played by IT will be a valuable asset in\nreviving Hong Kong  ' s wounded economy . \n\n \n\nAt a meeting initiated by Secretary for Commerce , Industry and\nTechnology Henry Tang Ying-yen , to exchange views with members of the IT\nindustry on how to rescue the economy , we urged the government to explore IT  ' s\npotential in helping other sectors . \n\n \n\nThe government  ' s Digital 21 strategy prioritises promoting the\nuse of IT and e-commerce .\n\n\nBut despite the efforts of the government , the adoption of IT has\nbeen disappointing , especially among small and medium-sized enterprises ( \nSMEs ) . \n\n \n\nNow is a good time for the government to act more aggressively .\n\n\nTo get companies back on normal business tracks , the government must\nhelp SMEs to understand that IT and e-commerce can result in greater\nflexibility , lower costs , higher productivity , greater market penetration\n, and closer relationships with suppliers and customers .\n\n\nPublic awareness measures in helping businesses move forward will be\nnecessary . \n\n \n\nThe government should communicate to SMEs that IT does not run\nparallel to \" normal &rdquo; business but encompasses all internal and\nexternal business processes . \n\n \n\nMany IT promotion initiatives of the past focused only on e-mail\ncommunication and Web presence .\n\n\nThey did not take into account that IT can integrate internal and\nexternal business processes in a digital business environment and can have\npositive impacts on both individual enterprises and whole industries . \n\n \n\nLessons learnt from this crisis will provide examples of how such\nbenefits can be achieved . \n\n \n\nIn long run , the government should identify critical leverage\npoints for the uptake of IT in different sectors . \n\n \n\nSars has clearly displayed the roles that e-learning , e-public\nservices , e-retail and so on can play in a knowledge-based economy . \n\n \n\nTo enable every citizen in Hong Kong to enjoy the benefits of IT\n, the government should work with trade members to build on innovative\nIT-based projects so as to improve the e-readiness of our society . \n\n \n\nSuch projects create more investment in the IT industry and also\nhelp bridge digital disparities in Hong Kong .\n\n\nThis is a win-win proposal that the government should consider . \n\n \n\nSars is the most serious problem faced by Hong Kong since the\n1997-98 financial crisis . \n\n \n\nIt has had a far worse impact than the war in Iraq . \n\n \n\nThe crisis has already put all business sectors into a difficult\nsituation . \n\n \n\nIt is imperative that the top priority is to fight and control\nthe spread of the virus . \n\n \n\nBut after the peak of Sars , the quick revival of our economy is\nalso important . \n\n \n\nThe IT industry has been working hand in hand with the community\nto cope with the present challenge . \n\n \n\nI urge the government to act decisively and promptly to turn this\nchallenge into an opportunity . \n\n \n\n Sin Chung-kai is the legislative councillor for information\ntechnology  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Outbreak takes its toll on region  ' s PC market but the effects\nare expected to be short-lived   \n\n\n Consultants say there is ample evidence the virus has caused a\ndrop in demand   \n\n\n Kelvin Wong  \n\n \n\nThe personal computer market in Asia-Pacific is feeling the\nimpact of severe acute respiratory syndrome (  Sars ) , but at least one expert\nexpects it to be only a short-term problem . \n\n \n\nFigures released by consulting firm International Data Corp ( \nIDC ) show a 10 per cent increase in PC sales to 6.26 million units in the\nfirst quarter of this year compared with the same period last year , but a 9\nper cent drop when compared with the fourth quarter of last year . \n\n \n\nIDC personal systems senior manager Bryan Ma said figures\ncovering the Sars outbreak were not available , but there was plenty of\nevidence that business had slumped .\n\n\n\" We have been speaking to PC vendors who say retail sales have\nslowed considerably because people are not going out to shop as much .\n&rdquo; \n\n \n\nMr Ma said the 10 per cent growth in PC sales in the first\nquarter of the year , compared with the same period last year , was due to\nthe emerging mainland market , with Australia and India also showing solid\ngrowth . \n\n \n\nOn mainland sales he said: \" Traditionally , sales in\nquarter one are slower because of the Lunar New Year holiday .\n\n\nWe are seeing the impact on home computer buyers because they are\njust not shopping out of fear of the virus , &rdquo; he said .  \n\n \n\nHowever , a spokeswoman for mainland computer maker Legend Group\nsaid the firm was not concerned about a Sars-induced slowdown . \n\n \n\n\" Buying a home PC is generally not an impromptu decision .\n\n\nWhile buyers usually give it a lot of thought , they don't have to\nspend a lot of time at computer shops because they can get the necessary\ninformation elsewhere - out of magazines and from the Internet , &rdquo; she\nsaid . \n\n \n\nMr Ma said PC makers faced an indirect slowdown in the Hong Kong\nmarket . \n\n \n\n\" We have already seen many concerts cancelled and a big\ndrop in the number of travellers coming to Hong Kong .\n\n\nThis will cut profit , which in turn will cut business need and\nability to buy new information technology hardware . \n\n \n\n\" We have to bear in mind that ultimately , whatever\nhappens in China will have regional and global implications as it is the\nbiggest emerging market in the world .\n\n\nIf multinational companies decide to pull out (  of China ) and other\ncountries bar their citizens from visiting (  China ) the effect will be huge .\n&rdquo; \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Seductive Sims stretches limits of players and PCs \n \n\n\n Review   \n\n\n SimCity 4   \n\n\nPeter Lau \n\n \n\n Developer:  Maxis \n\n \n\n Pros:  Seriously addictive game play and a nice\nchange from action-orientated games \n\n \n\n Cons:  Needs a high-powered computer to render the\ngraphics , quite a complex game that requires some thinking \n\n \n\n Price:  HK&dollar;250\n\n \n\nSimCity 4 lets you become the major of your own city and develop\nit from a bare patch of land to a sprawling metropolis .\n\n\nYou get to decide where people live , work and play . \n\n \n\nIf people like your decisions , more will move into your city .\n\n\nAs they do so , you will receive rewards such as status and houses ,\namong other interesting things . \n\n \n\nIn general , parks make your city more beautiful , police make\nit safe , schools educate your sims (  simulated people ) and all these factors\n, and more , contribute to how attractive your city is to live in . \n\n \n\nAlmost anything you can imagine that makes a city beautiful has\nbeen included in this game , such as parks , schools , universities , zoos\nand amusement parks .\n\n\nEvery city has its ugly side and , as mayor , you must decide where\nto place waste landfills , for example . \n\n \n\nIf your city is struggling financially , you will have to make\nsome tough decisions . \n\n \n\nI was going bankrupt and the military offered rent money in\nexchange for locating a military base for missile testing nearby .\n\n\nUnfortunately , the occasional missile test would fail and some sims\nwould awaken to find new lawn ornaments . \n\n \n\nAnother tough decision is whether to locate a toxic waste dump\nnear your city .\n\n\nThough dumping toxic waste pays well , who wants to live in a city\nwith pollution ? \n\n \n\nA crisis can strike your city at any time .\n\n\nYou may not have to deal with atypical pneumonia , but sometimes\nsims will go on strike because you cut funding , earthquakes may set off a\nfire , riots may erupt if you do not listen to public opinion and , without\ncareful management , pollution may foul your city . \n\n \n\nThe game is modelled on how real cities grow and if you play\nSimCity with that in mind you should have no trouble being a good mayor .\n\n\n \n\nWhen you start building your city , everything should be zoned\nlow density .\n\n\nLater , as the low-density areas fill up , you should start\nbulldozing certain sections of your town and rezoning them for medium density .\n\n\nAs the medium density fills up , rezone for high density .\n\n\nAll this is easier to see if you image how areas in Kowloon have\ndeveloped from scattered single homes to massive high-rise complexes . \n\n \n\nAddiction to this great , great grandfather of Sims games lies\nin trying to get bigger and bigger cities .\n\n\nAs your cities get bigger , with some reaching metropolis levels ( \nmore than a million people ) , you receive better rewards and get to see some\ncool looking office complexes and high-density housing designs . \n\n \n\nThe final incarnation of office building is a stage eight\ncomplex that accommodates 5000 employees .\n\n\nOne challenge is to build a big downtown area using several of these\nbuildings . \n\n \n\nYou can download landmarks , which have proven highly popular in\nprevious versions of the game .\n\n\nJust go to the www.simcity.com Web site to get the latest landmarks .\n\n\n \n\nSimCity has always involved a lot of guesswork and the latest\nversion is no exception .\n\n\nOne knows that Sims go to work , return home and go shopping , but\ncannot know exactly where they go , when or how .\n\n\nOne of the coolest new features this version offers is the ability\nto see where a sim goes exactly .\n\n\nYou can import your own sim from one of the Sims games to analyse\nwhat they are doing . \n\n \n\nAlso , this version of the game enables your city to be\nintegrated with another city developed by you , and commerce links to be\ncreated between the two . \n\n \n\nIt also has splendid graphics that are so detailed that they\ntend to stretch the capability of most computers .\n\n\nI had to turn the graphics options way down .\n\n\nSome graphics , such as the clouds that lazily float over the city ,\nare cute but prevent players from getting a clear view . \n\n \n\nIn the original , unpatched version of SimCity 4 , it was\ndifficult to get cities to grow past one million people .\n\n\nPatches have come out that make it easier to do so , and they also\nspeed up the game by shortening the time it takes to load and update graphics .\n\n\n \n\nSimCity 4 is a fantastic update of the original game .\n\n\nI highly recommend anyone new to this series to move into SimCity as\nsoon as possible .\n\n\nIt is a beautiful place and , best of all , it is designed by you .\n\n\n \n\n Any question or requests on games , e-mail

{"text": "Introduction  \n\n \n\nDevelopments in post-structuralist theories and post-colonial\ntheories have led to an exploration of the issue of translation and power in\nTranslation Studies in the last few decades .\n\n\nThe &lsquo; death of the author &rsquo; , first discussed by Roland\nBarthes , was followed by Michel Foucault  ' s discourse on power , and then by\nthe dethronement of the &lsquo; original &lsquo; and the demystification of\nthe metaphysical primacy of origin in the work of Jacques Derrida and the\ndeconstruction school of critics .\n\n\nDrawing from these insights , translation theorists have re-examined\nthe ideology of fidelity that has for long governed the practice of\ntranslation .\n\n\nThey have analyzed how the notion of translation as derivative from ,\nand subservient to , the source text rose to prominence .\n\n\nSubsequently they have exposed this notion as a historical and\nideological construct rather than an ontological given .\n\n\nFurthermore , they have affirmed ( through rereading Walter\nBenjamin ) the power of translation to provide a new lease of life\n-; an afterlife -; for the &lsquo; original &rsquo; .\n\n\nPost-colonial translation theorists , meanwhile , have alerted us to\nthe unequal power relations that always already exist in the transfer of\ntexts across cultures , and to the operation of translation as the\nideological handmaid of imperialism .\n\n\nThis ties in with studies on norms of translation -; first\ninitiated by proponents of the poly-system theory such as Itamar Even-Zohar\nand Gideon Toury .\n\n\nAnd , lately , Theo Hermans placed his study of norms within the\nframework of translation and power by analyzing them as complex social and\ncultural realities which translators , as active social agents , have to work\nwith or against in every stage of the process of translation ( Hermans\n1996 ) . \n\n \n\nThe purpose of this article is to take the issue of translation\nand power further and examine it from a broader sociological perspective .\n\n\nThe emphasis will not be on \" the study and practice of\ntranslation ( as ) inevitably an exploration of power\nrelationships within textual practice that reflect power structures within\nthe wider cultural context &rdquo; ( Bassnett 1996 : 21 ) .\n\n\nThe emphasis , instead , is on translation as an activity and how\nsuch an activity -; carried out in a particular historical context -;\nallowed the translators gain access to power .\n\n\nThe focus is on the Protestant missionary-translators based in Hong\nKong from 1842 until the end of the nineteenth century , and the examination\nwill be divided into three parts : ( 1 ) translators as\nwielders of power and as policy makers; ( 2 ) translators as\npropagators of ideology; and ( 3 ) translators as intellectual\ngladiators and ideological gatekeepers ! \n\n \n\nOne point that must be stressed is the context of Hong Kong from\n1842 until the end of the nineteenth century .\n\n\nAt that time , Hong Kong had a system of government more similar to\nthose of other British colonies in the world than that of China in the Qing\nDynasty .\n\n\nIt was run by a succession of governors whose allegiance was to the\nQueen of the United Kingdom rather than to the Emperor of China , but it was\nseparated from China only by a border which remained open for most of the\ntime , and it was inhabited by an overwhelming majority of Chinese whose ties\nwith their homeland were so strong that they mostly considered Hong Kong only\nas a temporary home .\n\n\nGiven this unique situation , it is necessary to analyze the impact\nof the work of the Protestant missionary-translators not only with reference\nto Hong Kong but also to China .\n\n\nIn other words , one needs a pair of bifocal glasses -; to look\nnear and afar , at Hong Kong as well as further afield at China .\n\n\nAnd this is the approach I shall adopt in this article .  \n\n\n Translators as wielders of power and policy makers \n\n\n \n\nThe Opium War and the conclusion of the Treaty of Nanking\n( 1842 ) made Hong Kong a British colony .\n\n\nTo the Protestant missionaries who had been trying for decades to\nevangelize China , this was a god-sent opportunity .\n\n\nHong Kong became not only their target for the spread of Christianity\nbut also a place where they could gain a foothold in China .\n\n\nBeing a colony , Hong Kong also provided them with a degree of\nfreedom , a kind of protection , and space for manoeuvre they could not\npossibly enjoy in the other five treaty ports which were open to foreign\ntrading and missionary activities as a result of the 1842 Treaty .After 1842\n, therefore , there was quite a gathering of Protestant missionaries in Hong\nKong .\n\n\nThey came from different missionary societies and different nations ,\nmaking up an intercultural group that is particularly worthy of study . \n\n \n\nMany in this group were , as it were , Renaissance men : they\nwere translators , intellectual heavyweights , polyglots , scholars , and\nmissionaries all rolled into one .\n\n\nThrough their work of translation , whether it was the translation of\nofficial government documents , of the Bible into Chinese , or of Chinese\nliterary and philosophical texts into English , they established their\ncredibility as competent mediators of cultures .\n\n\nThis credibility , in turn , provided them with opportunities unheard\nof by their counterparts working in the treaty ports and other parts of China .\n\n\nFor in the first two decades immediately after Hong Kong  ' s secession\nto Britain , there were few people within the Hong Kong government who could\nclaim competence in Chinese .\n\n\nThe administration desperately needed people whom they could trust\nand who could be relied upon not only for communication with the Chinese ,\nbut also for advice on policies that would have a direct impact on the 1ife\nof the populace .\n\n\nThe allegiance of the local Chinese was doubtful .\n\n\nThe community of traders and foreign merchants had to attend to their\nown interests .\n\n\nThere was , in a manner of speaking , a brain vacuum within the\nadministration .\n\n\nA power vacuum , too , that threatened effective administration of\nthe colony . \n\n \n\nThis power vacuum was filled by the Protestant missionaries .\n\n\nNot any Protestant missionaries , not even those who could speak\nCantonese and/or Mandarin , but missionaries whose command of the language\nwas proven by their work of translation .\n\n\nCertainly that was how John Morrison ( 1814-1843 ) ,\nKarl G&uumlaut;tzlaff ( 1803-1851 ) , James Legge (\n1815-1897 ) , and E . J . Eitel ( 1838-1908 ) rose to\nprominence .\n\n\nThe government believed that they were experts on Chinese culture and\nauthorities on the mind of the Chinese populace in Hong Kong .\n\n\nSuch a perception was not necessarily correct , of course .\n\n\nBut this was the context in which the relation between translation\nand power unfolded . \n\n \n\nThese four Protestant missionary-translators made use of their\npositions to exert an influence on the governor of the time .\n\n\nAll four succeeded to wield power in the formulation of government\npolicies .\n\n\nFrom 1843 to 1897 ( the year when Eitel retired from the Hong\nKong government ) , they took turns to formulate policies on education\nand these became official government policies which were fully implemented in\nHong Kong .\n\n\nJohn Morrison used his influence on Henry Pottinger , the first\ngovernor of Hong Kong , to obtain permission for the Morrison School to move\nfrom Macau to Hong Kong in 1842 .\n\n\nIn addition , be smoothed the way for the permission to the London\nMissionary Society to have their Anglo-Chinese College ( then based in\nMalacca ) move to Hong Kong .\n\n\nThe opening of these two schools marked the beginning of the\ndevelopment of Western education by the Protestant missionaries in Hong Kong .\n\n\nThe two schools &lsquo; emphasis on teaching the English language and\nwestern knowledge also institutionalized an educational practice distinctly\ndifferent from the traditional orthodox Chinese educational practice .\n\n\nKarl G&uumlaut;tzlaff , who succeeded John Morrison as Chinese\nSecretary upon Morrison  ' s death on 29 August 1843 , likewise used his\ninfluence and persuaded Pottinger to introduce the grant-in-aid system , thus\nmarking the beginning of the development of public education in Hong Kong\n&lsquo; .\n\n\nJames Legge , a Non-Conformist opposed to the Anglican attempt to\nenforce religious teaching in government schools , also gained great\ninfluence in the government .\n\n\nSignificantly , this happened after the publication , in 1861 , of\nthe first of his monumental eight-volume work of translation -; \nChinese Classics  -; which , in addition to translations , carried\nextensive notes and commentaries .\n\n\nHe was able to push through his plan for educational reforms , which\npromoted secular education at the expense of religious education , and which\nmade the teaching of English a prominent part of the curriculum in government\nschools in Hong Kong !\n\n\nTo facilitate the teaching of English , Legge translated from English\nGeorge Baker  ' s  Graduated Reading : Comprising A Circle of Knowledge ,\nin 200 Lessons  for use as textbooks .\n\n\nHe also established Central College -; an amalgamation of the\nthree largest government schools in Hong Kong .\n\n\nHis plan was to utilize the limited resources of the government to\ndevelop the college into a model of secular education for other schools to\nfollow .\n\n\nEducation for the elite was thus introduced into Hong Kong . \n\n \n\nE. J. Eitel  ' s ascension to power was likewise the result of\nhis achievements in the field of translation and Sinology .\n\n\nHe was as influential as Legge though , being a strong advocate of\nreligious education , his policy manoeuvres were aimed to check the dominance\nof secular education in Hong Kong .\n\n\nIn this he was largely successful .\n\n\nSix years after Legge had left Hong Kong and beginning from 1879 , a\ntrend emerged whereby secular education was practised in government schools\nand religious education in missionary schools . &rdquo;\n\n\nAnother trend established by Eitel was the government  ' s gradual\nwithdrawal from vernacular education to channel resources into a grant scheme\ndesigned primarily for missionary schools .\n\n\nAnd if Legge  ' s introduction of the teaching of English was meant to\ntrain students with bilingual abilities , then under Eitel  ' s regime , there\nwas a deliberate change of policy and a new initiative to promote English\neducation for the elite . \n\n \n\nIt is clear , therefore , that these translators were not only\ntranslators , they were translators with a mission -; namely to change\nthe hearts and minds of people and convert them to Christianity through both\nsecular and religious education .\n\n\nThey might not have succeeded in this .\n\n\nAnd yet the policies they made had far-reaching consequences for the\ndevelopment of education in Hong Kong .\n\n\nEven today , many schools in Hong Kong are still run by missionaries .\n\n\nThere are still grant-in-aid schools .\n\n\nThe liberal arts tradition still runs strong .\n\n\nMost significant of all , the policy of elitist education -; the\nheritage of Legge , intentional or otherwise -; and the privileging of\nEnglish-language education over and above mother-tongue education -; the\ndeliberate manoeuvre of Eitel -; have influenced the attitudes of\ngenerations of Hong Kong Chinese .\n\n\nEven now , many still believe in the superiority of prestigious\nEnglish-language schools . \n\n \n\nThe policies laid down by these Protestant missionary-translators\nalso had far-reaching consequences on the evolution of society .\n\n\nTheir emphasis on teaching the English language met the urgent\ncommercial needs of Hong Kong as well as the administrative needs of the\ngovernment at the time .\n\n\nThe western style education they promoted produced many graduates who\nwere fairly outward looking and who could facilitate interaction between the\nEast and the West .\n\n\nWithin a few decades after its becoming a colony , therefore , Hong\nKong was transformed into a society relatively more westernized and more\nliberal in outlook than the society in Imperial China .\n\n\nThis was due in no small measure to the influence of these Protestant\nmissionary-translators , though there was a host of other complex factors as\nwell .\n\n\nBearing in mind that Western-style education did not manage to take\nroot in China until the Imperial Examination was officially abolished in 1905\n, the impact these missionary-translators left in Hong Kong is even more\nobvious\n\n\nWhether such an impact is positive , negative , or both , is a moot\nquestion -; it was so in the past , it is so in the present , it probably\nwill be so in the future .\n\n\nBut what emerges clearly from the above analysis is that these\nProtestant missionary-translators were great opportunists .\n\n\nThey took full advantage of the leverage they gained through their\nactivity of translation and established themselves within the power structure\nof the colonial government .\n\n\nNot only that .\n\n\nWith their policies on education , they played a leading role in the\nidentity reconstruction programme -; that is , in the moulding of the\nOther in the image of one  ' s Self -; which is one of the cornerstones of\nthe power politics of colonialism .\n\n\nIn short , they had helped to turn Hong Kong into a translation and a\ncopy , albeit an &lsquo; inferior &lsquo; copy and a &lsquo; bad &lsquo;\ntranslation , of its colonial master .  \n\n\n Translators as propagators of ideologies  \n\n \n\nAll missionaries were committed to the propagation of the\nChristian faith/ideology .\n\n\nThe crucial role , however , was played by the missionary-translators .\n\n\nFor they were responsible for the translation into Chinese of the\nBible -; that most sacred embodiment of the precepts of Christianity .\n\n\nMany missionary-translators , in Hong Kong as well as in China , had\nbeen involved in this task , as the Bible saw many translations and revisions\nfrom 1842 until the end of the nineteenth century .\n\n\nBut it was a missionary-translator in Hong Kong who emerged as the\nmost dynamic , most entrepreneurial , and most controversial propagator of\nthe Christian ideology -; Karl G&uumlaut;tzlaff .\n\n\nWhen the Taiping Uprising ( 1850-1864 ) -; the\nlargest anti-Manchu rebellion in nineteenth century China broke out , it was\nG&uumlaut;tzlaff  ' s 1840 Bible , which saw many editions within that decade ,\nwhich was adopted as the Taiping Bible , not the other Chinese translations\nof the Bible available at the time .\n\n\nEven though the Delegates &lsquo; Version soon appeared ( New\nTestament -; 1852; Old Testament -; 1854 ) and was considered the\nmost authoritative by most missionaries working in China , it did not replace\nG&uumlaut;tzlaff  ' s Bible in subsequent editions of the Taiping Bible .\n\n\nAs the Taipings were mostly members of a religious society (\ncalled God Worshippers or   Bai Shangdi Hui  \n) whose initial aim , according to Hong Xiuquan  the founder , was to destroy demons and idols and to bring China back to\nthe worship of the true God , the Taiping Bible belonged to the canonical\nliterature of the God Worshippers and formed part of the basis of their\nbeliefs -; an eclectic blend of Christian , Buddhist , and Confucian\ndoctrines and ideas .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c762bb36-fb6d-48b6-929d-d14c956080b2", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.988821+00:00"}

\n\n \n\n Carolyn Ong  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Slim , sexy Sony will seduce you   \n\n\n\n Sony Wega KLV-30MR1  \n\n \n\nSpecifications \n\n \n\n Price:  HK&dollar;39,880 \n\n \n\n Pros:  Superb design gives it a viewing effect\nwider than its 30 inches \n\n \n\n Cons:  Paying the premium for the Sony name \n\n \n\nComing to Fortress soon is a new 30-inch liquid-crystal display\ntelevision from Sony .\n\n\nIf you think the sleek , silver LCD TVs from Sharp , Samsung and\nPhilips are good-looking , wait till you lay eyes on this beauty . \n\n \n\nPriced at HK&dollar;39,880 , the Sony LCD Wega TV KLV-30MR1 is\nalmost affordable with Fortress ' instalment plans , at least for a Sony\nproduct . \n\n \n\nThe new wide-screen LCD Wega is encased in an ultra-slim and a\ntruly elegant glass-frame display , which gives it a floating effect . \n\n \n\nThere is a subtle illumination effect on the Sony logo and the\nlight indicators on its function panel really enhance the design .\n\n\nIt will be the talking point in any living room . \n\n \n\nThe new Wega has high contrast even in a very bright room , and\nits picture resolution of 1280 by 768 pixels is sharp and crystal clear .\n\n\nI was unable to compare it to other competing 30-inch LCD TVs , but\nonce the product is selling in Fortress alongside other TVs , you will be\nable to judge for yourself . \n\n \n\nSony has equipped the LCD Wega with its recently developed LCD\nPanel Driver , a new digital processing technology to ensure a smoother and\nclearer image flow by improving the response time and enhancing moving image\nresolution . \n\n \n\nIt also comes with built-in 20-watt speakers .\n\n\nEven though the Wega will almost certainly be connected to a DVD or\nvideo player , its media receiver unit , like virtually every Sony product\nthese days , has a Memory Stick slot . \n\n \n\n Carolyn Ong  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Wi-Fi hot spots given lukewarm reception   \n\n\n CAROLYN ONG  \n\n \n\nYou would think there are enough laptop-toting yuppie road\nwarriors in this town to fill a small Pacific Coffee shop in Taikoo Place .\n\n\n \n\nIt has been more than a year since PCCW wired up about 30 Pacific\nCoffee cafes across Hong Kong with wireless broadband Internet access . \n\n \n\nPCCW has since added Starbucks , Delifrance and other smaller\ncoffee houses to the list of Wi-Fi hot spots , but a tour of Pacific Coffee ,\nStarbucks and some independent coffee houses with WLAN prompts a\ndisheartening observation - I am often the only one logging on to the service .\n\n\n \n\nSince Samsung equipped me with its latest sleek and very\nbeautiful X10 notebook PC with Intel mobile Centrino technology for\nevaluation purposes , I have been going on an international Wi-Fi hot spot\ntesting rampage .\n\n\nWhile coffee house computing is cool , the experience of logging on\nis patchy and should be more friendly to the user . \n\n \n\nOne of the main problems is that , apart from some Pacific Coffee\nshops and some Starbucks , there are few places where you can get wirelessly\nonline outside of the office .\n\n\nNever mind that by 2005 , more than 80 per cent of professional\nlaptops will have 802.11 WLAN interface (  according to Gartner research\ngroup ) and that about 7,000 hot spots are expected to sprout up by the same\nyear in the Asia-Pacific region , earning more than US&dollar;1.3 billion\nfrom 10.2 million users . \n\n \n\nThese are really encouraging and uplifting figures , but my\nexperience surfing in WLAN cafes was quite the contrary . \n\n \n\nThe hardware may be there , but easily accessible networks\nconnected to the Internet and consistent , reliable connection are not . \n\n \n\nFor example , if you try to log on to the service at Pacific\nCoffee at PCCW Tower in Taikoo Place , getting access from the tables placed\noutside the shop is impossible , even though you are supposed to be able to\nget connected .\n\n\nSo accessing your e-mail while having a smoke is out of the question .\n\n\nFurther , the service is patchy , especially if you are looking to\nconnect free . \n\n \n\nSwire offers free connectivity to its Taikoo Place , CityPlaza\nand Pacific Place customers .\n\n\nTo log on free , you have to submit your e-mail address and complete\na short survey .\n\n\nWhile that works sometimes , it does not work all the time .\n\n\nWhen it does not work , there is no one at Pacific Coffee able to\nhelp you out . \n\n \n\nIn the past month , I have twice tried logging on from Chek Lap\nKok airport .\n\n\nWi-Fi connectivity was advertised to be airport-wide , but I could\nonly get access from Starbucks and some gates close to Cathay Pacific lounges .\n\n\n \n\nThe Singapore airport had free WLAN access , too , but the\nexperience , though smooth , was a little annoying because of the long online\nsurvey form you have to fill before you can enjoy the free wireless ride .\n\n\nMy biggest problem with hot spots in Hong Kong is the lack of clearly\ndisplayed signs telling you that you have entered a Wi-Fi zone . \n\n \n\nIn Singapore , signs are clearly displayed with a recognisable\nWi-Fi-zone symbol .\n\n\nSingTel , one of two Wi-Fi hot spot operators there , is also heavily\npromoting its hot spots with television commercials educating audi ences\nwhere to find hot spots and how to log on - something else that is lacking\nhere . \n\n \n\nTo log on to a SingTel-operated hot spot , you have to key in\nyour mobile phone number and the password is your ID card number .\n\n\nOnly SingTel subscribers can use the service , unlike PCCW  ' s service\nwhere non-Netvigator customers can also use the service by paying for it with\ntheir credit cards . \n\n \n\nIn almost every hot spot I had taken the Samsung X10 to , I was\noften the only Wi-Fi user .\n\n\nAt a Starbucks in the Bank of America building , I was able to talk\nto another Wi-Fi user . He was accessing e-mail using an HP iPaq . \n\n \n\n\" I don't think many of my colleagues know about hot spots\nor what they are , in fact .\n\n\nThe carriers get more mind share , I think , but GPRS is so expensive\nso most people think accessing e-mail on the go is a costly exercise .\n\n\nI prefer WLAN anyway because it is higher-bandwidth and cheaper .\n\n\nIf you are working in Central , it is pretty easy to find a hot spot\n, &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\nThere are more hot spots in Hong Kong than Singapore - slightly\nmore than 200 here and about 120 in Singapore .\n\n\nBut if you were walking about in each city , you would get the\nfeeling that there are more hot spots in Singapore because of the clearly\nlabelled Wi-Fi zones .\n\n\nAt Singapore Changi airport , it is also easy to locate hot spots -\nbig white booths with Intel mobile Centrino marketing signs . \n\n \n\nSingTel  ' s plan is priced at 20.8 Singaporean cents (  about\nHK&dollar;0.98 ) per minute , while StarHub charges S&dollar;0.0015 for every\nkilobyte of data downloaded .\n\n\nPCCW charges HK&dollar;6 per 10-minute block for non-Netvigator\nusers , while Netvigator subscribers ' rates are HK&dollar;3 per 10-minute\nsession . \n\n \n\nAs an alternative , a monthly package of HK&dollar;28 for 20\nsessions has also been introduced to Netvigator subscribers . \n\n \n\nConfiguring your laptop for WLAN is easy , provided you know\nwhat to click .\n\n\nWhile it seemed obvious to activate the WLAN configuration setting\nor your Windows network setting to gain access , the average PC user might\nnot know what to do and Starbucks staff will not be able to help .\n\n\nIt is easier using a laptop equipped with Intel  ' s mobile Centrino\ntechnology - it automatically detects Wi-Fi zones and to enter , it is just\none button click . \n\n \n\n Got a gadget idea ?

{"text": "Warning over beaches   \n\n\n Chris Cheng  \n\n \n\nRecently heavy rainfall has led to a serious deterioration in\nwater quality at some of the territory  ' s beaches , the Environmental\nProtection Department said yesterday . \n\n \n\nA department spokesman warned swimmers to stay away from beaches\nfor up to three days after a storm and said that heavy rain had flushed large\nquantities of pollutants into the sea , particularly at beaches close to\ndeveloped areas . \n\n \n\nLatest tests show that water quality at at least nine of the 45\nbeaches with water quality grades , including six on the south side of Hong\nKong Island , have dropped in the past two weeks .\n\n\nFour gazetted beaches -; Anglers  '  , Castle Peak , Old Cafeteria\nand Rocky Bay -; remain closed to swimmers because of high health hazards .\n\n\nThe spokesman said that grades fluctuated wildly during the summer\nbecause storms and stronger tides affected pollution at beaches . \n\n \n\n\" Besides with highly developed hinterlands are likely to be\nmore polluted than the grades suggest during and after heavy rain . \n\n \n\n\" Bathers should avoid such beaches for two or three days\nafter a storm , longer if the weather remains overcast or shorter if there is\nstrong sunshine , &rdquo; the spokesman said . \n\n \n\nBeaches on the south side of Hong Kong Island remain the most\nhazardous places to swim , with Big Wave Bay , Shek O and Hairpin beaches\nrating as poor.\n\n\nWater quality at the three has dropped from fair in previous weeks .\n\n\n \n\nOnly South Bay was rated as \" good &rdquo; while the\nremaining beaches were average .  \n\n \n\n\n Anger at scouts  '  mahjong jamboree   \n\n\n Chris Cheng  \n\n \n\nThe Scout Association has defended attacks from scout leaders\nthat a fund-raising mahjong tournament will set a bad example for scout and\ncubs . \n\n \n\nThe contest , to be held in October , is to raise funds for its\nnew headquarters . \n\n \n\nMany scout leaders believe using mahjong to raise money would\ngive many youngsters the impression gambling was an acceptable   pastime  . \n\n \n\nThey say that the tournament breaches the scouts  '  code of ethics .\n\n\n \n\nThe association has insisted that gambling will be banned from\nthe tournament and the only payments will be players  '  entry fees .\n\n\nThe association has told its leaders that participants should be\neither superintendents , committee members , or scout leaders who are aged 18\nor above . \n\n \n\nThe tournament hopes to raise at least &dollar;4m . \n\n \n\nA leader of a school  ' s scout group , who would only give his\nname as Wong , said he was disturbed because mahjong and its association with\ngambling contravened the spirit of scouting .\n\n\nHe said that scouting should not be associated with the tournament .\n\n\n \n\nDaniel Leung , the acting chief scout executive , said : \"\nIt is just a charitable game which involves our own members .\n\n\nThis has nothing to do with gambling . \n\n \n\n\" The money is to build a new headquarters . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nLeung said the association chose mahjong for its fund-raiser\nbecause it was a very popular game and it would attract more members . \n\n\n \n\n\n Residents call for return of police offices   \n\n\n Chris Cheng  \n\n \n\nScared Tuen Mun residents yesterday repeated their call for the\nre-opening of neighbourhood police offices and a greater police presence\nafter the area  ' s latest sex attack , this time on an 11-year-old girl . \n\n \n\nThe girl was stripped and photographed in broad day-light on\nWednesday . \n\n \n\nDuring a meeting with legislators yesterday , members of a Tuen\nMun concern group demanded immediate action . \n\n \n\nTheir representative , Ng Hak-keung , said there was an urgent\nneed to reopen the police offices . \n\n \n\nThe latest attack took place early on Wednesday .\n\n\nThe young girl was molested only metres from her second-floor home in\nOn Hei House , Yau Oi Estate . \n\n \n\nShe was on her way home from a supermarket when the assailant\ncarried her to the third floor , ordered her to strip , took photographs of\nher and indecently assaulted her . \n\n \n\nIt was the ninth attack in the attack in the area since July ,\nwhen the teenager , Ip Wing-sze , was raped and murdered in the nearby Leung\nChun House , Leung King Estate . \n\n \n\nMore attacks took place despite the arrests of seven people in\nrelation to the crimes . \n\n \n\nFive of those arrested have been charged . \n\n \n\nNg told legislators there were many police offices in Tuen Mun 10\nyears ago but they were closed about five years ago due to a police manpower\nshortage . \n\n \n\nHe said the closures might have indirectly contributed to the\nrecent deterioration of law and order in the district . \n\n \n\nAnother group member , Rebecca So , said having the neighbourhood\npolice offices set up in densely-populated areas had many advantages . \n\n \n\n\" If there is an NPO in our area , policemen stationed\nthere who are familiar with the district would find it easier to get around ,\n&rdquo; she said . \n\n \n\n\" If there is a crime , they would be able to get to the\nscene of the crime much quicker . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nSo said the offices could act as a preventative measure to\ndiscourage crimes and improve communication between policemen and local\nresidents . \n\n \n\nSo said she hoped that if the police were really concerned about\nthe safety of Tuen Mun residents , they would reopen the neighbourhood police\noffices immediately and increase the police presence . \n\n \n\nA legislator , Allen Lee , said after meeting residents that he\nrealised the importance of police offices in preventing crimes and would\nraise the issue with the Legislative Council  ' s Security Panel . \n\n \n\nTo Kun-sun , another legislator , said this issue was worth\nfurther discussion .\n\n\nHe said he was sure all councilors would agree that expenditure on\nsocial security should be increased if necessary .  \n\n \n\n\n Stop imports : union   \n\n\n Chris Cheng  \n\n \n\nThe Government  ' s decision to import 11,000 workers was attacked\nby another trade union yesterday . \n\n \n\nThe union demanded the labour importation policy be scrapped\nimmediately in order to protect local workers . \n\n \n\nThe Hong Kong Department Stores and Commercial Staff General\nUnion yesterday objected to the Government  ' s allocation of a large quota of\nabout 3,200 jobs in retailing and the import and export sectors to imported\nworkers . \n\n \n\nThe chairwoman of the union , Chan Yuen-han , said labour groups\nhad explained to the Government the importance of retraining employees from\ndeclining industries to fill gaps in other industries , but the Government\nnever considered their opinions . \n\n \n\nIt ignored the rights of Hong Kong workers by extending the\nlabour importation policy , making many local workers , especially those over\n35 and with little schooling , unable to find suitable jobs . \n\n \n\nChan said she had received many complaints from workers who could\nnot find jobs after finishing courses provided by the Employees Retraining\nBoard ( ERB ) . \n\n \n\nShe said statistics showed there was a serious shrinkage in the\nmanufacturing industry , from 890,000 workers in 1988 to 455,900 this year .\n\n\n \n\nShe said the hotel industry had the same problem . \n\n \n\n\" In the first six months this year , six or seven hotels\nclosed , making over 4,000 workers unemployed , &rdquo; Chan said . \n\n \n\nUnder this situation , the Government and the ERB should help\nworkers solve their employment problems and not import labour , making the\ncondition worse , Chan said .  \n\n \n\n\n Education of elderly &lsquo; inadequately funded &rsquo;\n  \n\n\n Chris Cheng  \n\n \n\nAn educational group has condemned the Government for not\nproviding adequate funds to educate the elderly . \n\n \n\nThe Hong Kong Association for Continuing Education said the\nGovernment was ignoring the right of the elderly to be educated . \n\n \n\nCheung Man-ping , the secretary of the association , said the\nGovernment had recently feigned concern for the elderly with its proposed old\nage pension scheme . \n\n \n\nHe said officials had failed to provide adequate funds for\nelderly education and had hampered any development in the area . \n\n \n\nCheung said that education helped old and retired people\nestablish self-confidence and added meaning to their lives . \n\n \n\nHe said according to the Education Department , about &dollar;1m\nwas provided for elderly education in 1993-95 and 4,025 old people benefited\nfrom the funding . \n\n \n\nIn the current fiscal year , the Government has allocated about\n&dollar;1.5m , which is expected to benefit 5,400 elderly people . \n\n \n\n\" On average , each old person only receive a &dollar;300\nsubsidy , while each ordinary school-age student can be subsidised with more\nthan &dollar;10,000 each year , &rdquo; Cheung said . \n\n \n\nCheung said in some Western countries and in China , governments\nhad life-long educational concepts which meant that learning should not be\nage-bound . \n\n \n\nHe urged the Government to set up an old people  ' s affairs\ncommittee to handle elderly education . \n\n \n\nIn Wing-chak , the principal of the Christian Hong Kong Nam Wah\nPost Secondary College , which has provided the elderly with education for\nabout 10 years , said there were several hundred universities and countless\nschools providing education for more than 300,000 old people in China . \n\n \n\nKwan Li-ming , a former school principal who now studies theology\nat Nam Wah College , said that old people needed schooling particularly in an\nadvanced society where new technology developed every day . \n\n \n\nKwan , who pays &dollar;350 in tuition fees each month , said\nsome old people could not afford such rates . \n\n \n\nHe said if it was possible , he would continue his learning in\norder to get a doctorate . \n\n \n\n\" I would continue my learning until the last day of my\nlife , &rdquo; Kwan said .  \n\n \n\n\n Qingling Motor makes glittering H stare debut   \n\n\n By Thomas Lau  \n\n \n\nCHINA  ' s Qingling Motor made a powerful stock market debut\nyesterday , climbing 68 per cents or 32.85 per cent to close at &dollar;2.75 .\n\n\n \n\nThe glittering performance was , however , in line with\nexpectations and appeared to justify the reduction in price-earnings ratio\nbased on the offer price . \n\n \n\nA hefty 159.9 million shares worth &dollar;436.08 million changed\nhands . \n\n \n\nAnalysts had expected the truck assembler to rise 25 per cent on\nits first day , a performance that contrasts with the previous issue and\nhighlights the reversal in sentiment over the past month . \n\n \n\nLuoyang Glass , the last H share issue , slumped 20 per cent from\nits issue price when it made its debut last month . \n\n \n\nQingling Motor , the 11th H share to be listed in Hong Kong ,\nrose sharply from the offer price of &dollar;2.07 to hit a high of\n&dollar;3.00 , a 44.9 per cent record increase on its first day of trading .\n\n\n \n\nA research analyst from Sun Hung Kai Securities , Li Shing Wa ,\nsaid the good debut performance of Qingling was largely due to positive\nmarket sentiment . \n\n \n\nThe decision by Morgan Stanley to reduce Japan  ' s weighting in\nits global equity portfolio from 30 per cent to 20 per cent meant the stock\nhad attracted more speculation , he added . \n\n \n\n\" The share is likely to edge up further as fund managers\nmay buy the stock for long-term investment and not for short-term speculation\n, &rdquo; said the senior analyst at PW Asia Brokerage , Kinson Au . \n\n \n\nQingling fixed on offer price at a price/earnings ( P/E\n) ratio of nine , the lowest of the 10 H stocks already listed in the\nterritory . \n\n \n\nIts public offering for 100 million H shares in Hong Kong was\n22.5 times oversubscribed . \n\n \n\n\" The P/E was appropriate judging from the market situation\n, &rdquo; chairman , Wu Yun said . \n\n \n\nThe company hoped to raise about &dollar;1.03 billion from its\npublic offer .  \n\n \n\n\n SmarTone dials up new services   \n\n\n By Thomas Lau  \n\n \n\nCELLULAR phone operator SmarTone Mobile Communications has\nlaunched a series of new services and coverage networks to build on its\ncompetitive position in the local market , according to SmarTone chief\nexecutive office Douglas Li . \n\n \n\n\" InfoAccess , &rdquo;

!\n\n\nYou should be wondering why I broke my words .\n\n\nWell , as I said , he  ' s only a part time one .\n\n\nI cannot even talk to him for more than three minutes in the school\n, but he  ' s so understanding and mature in many ways and he knows me so well .\n\n\nMaybe I should say that he  ' s only my   closest\n friend who is a man .\n\n\nI find myself cannot forget Popeye although he may have forgotten me .\n\n\nI know that I should get this guy out of my heart .\n\n\nJust give me some more time ,\n\n\nI can do it . \n\n \n\nWhen I go through the above paragraph that I wrote , I found out\nthat I  ' ve described it too sadly .\n\n\nBut actually I just feel nothing about it .\n\n\nMaybe it  ' s because my part time boyfriend  ' s help .\n\n\nHe really helps to make me feel better when I am down .\n\n\nBut he doesn't  care about his\ngirlfriend very much who is me .\n\n\nI cannot even find him in the hallway in the recess time because his\nlocker is so far away from mine and he never cares to come to my locker .\n\n\nThat  ' s why I called him my part time boyfriend \n\n \n\nThere  ' s something I want to tell you , Leslie ,\n\n\nactually Tom Cheung still phones me once in a while , about two or\nthree times a month .\n\n\nHe doesn't say anything special , just tell me how he  ' s doing .\n\n\nI really get upset when I hear his voice ! \n\n\nI  ' ll write to you later when I have the time and patience .\n\n\nWell , it  ' s soon enough !\n\n\nTell me how you did in the exam when you next write . \n\n\nJudith\n\n\n90 H'mas . \n\n\n\n\nHi there ,\n\n \n\nChan Yin Tat , you nuts !\n\n\nLeave a pager number to us ? !\n\n\nIs it that difficult to contact you ?\n\n\nHa , just kidding .\n\n\nYou are probably still living in dorm , eh ?\n\n\nWhat year are you in , anyway ?\n\n\nEnjoy it ?\n\n\nThanx for you neat mail ,\n\n\nit  ' s interesting . \n\n \n\nAnd , thanx for Albert , the guy that is handsome and smart ? !\n\n\nOh , come on .\n\n\nAh ... ha ... !\n\n\nThanx for the information ,\n\n\nit does help .\n\n\nI  ' m very appreciate it , seriously . \n\n \n\nWell , here , it  ' s been started to snow already .\n\n\nToday . . . cold . . . cold . . . !

{"text": "The game business   \n\n\n by Vieienne Chow   \n\n \n\n HIGH RESOLUTION  colour displays , Internet access ,\nand multi-layered sound systems have not only made the mobile phone one of\nthe most desirable objects at the moment; they have given budding\nentrepreneurs a chance to demonstrate their creative talents by incorporating\ncompatible technology . \n\n \n\n\" Mobile phones have a lot more functions than just making\nphone calls , &rdquo; said 24-year-old Kurt Chan Chun-fau , who runs a game\ndevelopment company , Mobile Gamer . \n\n \n\n\" Mobile phone game development is an industry for and by\nyoung people .\n\n\nIn fact games are just a part of mobile phone entertainment , which\nwill be developed into a new media channel . &rdquo;\n\n\nMobile Gamer is just one company developing mobile phone games in Hong\nKong . Michael Kan Chi-kin , the executive director of Hong Kong Wireless\nTechnology Industry Association Ltd , says there are about 10 companies\ninvolved in this industry .\n\n\nAnd all have been formed by people in their 20s or early 30s . \n\n \n\n\" This is a new industry , and Hong Kong is the third most\nadvanced place (  in developing mobile phone games ) after Japan and South\nKorea , &rdquo; said Mr Kan . \n\n \n\n\" With the launch of mobile phones supporting Java script ,\ngetting into this business .\n\n\nThe rapid increase in GPRS (  General Packet Radio Service]\nsubscribers by 87 percent in the last four months of 2002 shows that there  ' s\na chance for the game downloading business . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nMobile Gamer has created a game called Happy Together which\nfeatures likenesses of political figures such as Secretary for Security\nRegina Ip Lau Suk-yee and Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa .\n\n\nAnother game entitled Fighting College is a mobile version of Street\nFighter . \n\n \n\nMobile phone game company M Bounce , which has developed more\nthan 60 games with stunning graphics , has launched a game based on yoga .\n\n\nThe game calculates how many calories are burnt by taking on various\nyoga positions .\n\n\nAnd another game , Love Diver , has a driver swim to the seabed to\ncollect things his girlfriend wants while trying to avoid the sharks . \n\n \n\nThese game developers are not just looking at local markets ,\ntheir products have attracted attention from Thailand , the Philippines , the\nmainland , Taiwan and Europe . \n\n \n\nBut games do not guarantee success .\n\n\nAccording to Mr Kan , three more elements are needed to make the\nindustry prosperous . \n\n \n\n\" The percentage of people using the new mobile phones is\nstill small , and the popularity of mobile phone games relies on the\npenetration of these handsets , &rdquo; Mr Kan said . \n\n \n\n\" The subscription fee for GPRS has to be reduced further\nin order to attract more mobile phone users to go online .\n\n\nAn increase in bandwidth would encourage the development of online\nmulti-player games . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nNegotiating with the six mobile phone operators is not easy .\n\n\n\" Unlike Japan , Hong Kong has no standardised profit-sharing\nguidelines between operators and developer , and we hope that through\nlobbying with the operators we can come up with a better scheme to free up\nthe negotiation process , &rdquo; said Mr Kan . \n\n \n\n\" We are just a small company and lack experience , so\nsometimes it  ' s hard to follow the bureaucratic procedures when dealing with\nmobile phone operators , &rdquo; said Mr Chan . \n\n \n\nThe key to a winning game , says M Bounce  ' s Richard Cheung\nLap-tak is to combine creativity and originally with top graphics to deliver\na simple concept . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Quality takes a knock in a liberalised telecom industry\n  \n\n\n SIMON CHAN  \n\n \n\nJanuary 1 was a milestone in the history of the\ntelecommunications industry in Hong Kong .\n\n\nWith the opening up of local fixed-line telecom network services ,\nHong Kong has liberalised the telecoms industry , from carriers to\nvalued-added service providers . \n\n \n\nThe good news is that users can enjoy a wide range of services\nfrom different operators at a competitive price .\n\n\nBut there has also been an unprecedented number of complaints .\n\n\nWhat has gone wrong ?\n\n\nIs the quality of service really degraded ?\n\n\nWhat are the expectations for quality of service ?\n\n\nAnd what should we do to fix it ? \n\n \n\nA common myth is that competition will improve quality .\n\n\nNot true .\n\n\nThe complaint statistics from the Office of the Telecommunications\nAuthority (  Ofta ) show an alarming trend . \n\n \n\nThe number of complaints is projected to rise 36 per cent from\n1,733 in 2001 to 2,361 for last year .\n\n\nIn 1997 , there were 87 complaints .\n\n\nRecent statistics from the Consumer Council revealed 4,684 cases in\n2001 , up 51 per cent on 2000 .\n\n\nOf these complaints , Internet services have overtaken mobile-phone\nservices as the top troublemakers . \n\n \n\nIt is also obvious that from a business consumer  ' s perspective ,\nthe quality of service criteria for different services are not transparent .\n\n\nSome of these have been crafted in Service Level Agreements (  SLA ) ,\nbut the majority are never published . \n\n \n\nEven in the recent network jam incident of September 11 last year\n, the lack of transparency between fixed and mobile networks led a lot of\npeople to complain about the quality of our networks , even though the latter\nare among the world  ' s best . \n\n \n\nThe fixed network is engineered to allow a maximum of one out of\n100 calls to be blocked , and five out of 100 for the mobile network except\nin emergency circumstances .\n\n\nThese network quality-of-service measurements should be published\nregularly so that consumers have more information when choosing an operator .\n\n\n \n\nOther performance measurements include time to install new\nservices; network reliability , repeated customer fault reports , the ability\nto meet targeted repair times , complaint handling and billing .\n\n\nThese statistics may have been available to the individual operators\n, but were never made public for the obvious reasons that they might hurt the\ncarriers ' image . \n\n \n\nA classic example of poor customer service is the maze of machine\nvoices on customer hotlines when you try to contact a human for assistance .\n\n\nOne operator  ' s customer hotline is unmanned and , after forcing the\nanxious customer to wait in vain for up to seven minutes , it drops the call .\n\n\nOther hotlines will hide the operator behind several voice menus so\nthat only their staff can reach them .\n\n\nHow promptly complaints are dealt with is a good indicator of quality\nof service and can be used to select a new service . \n\n \n\nFrom a qualitative standpoint , customer-satisfaction surveys can\nbe conducted to either match those described previously or supplement other\naspects such as customer satisfaction .\n\n\nIn order to reap good quality in a fully liberalised market such as\nHong Kong's , we should not just set our sights on lowering prices , quality\nmust be made transparent .\n\n\nThe danger is that we let quality fall below a minimum acceptable\nlevel , affecting our reputation as a telecommunications hub of Asia . \n\n\n \n\nFor example , Internet surfing response times to overseas Web\nsites will degrade for second-tier ISPs as they drive down costs by adding\nnew users without increasing their bandwidth . \n\n \n\nData on quality will have to come from each operator .\n\n\nWill they provide such sensitive data ?\n\n\nIt will not be easy .\n\n\nThis is where the regulator can help . \n\n \n\nIn Britain , the telecom regulator Oftel published a set of\nComparable Performance Indicators (  at www.cpi.org.uk ) to help consumers\ncompare the quality of services from a range of British telecom companies .\n\n\nIn Hong Kong , Ofta is in the best position to publish similar\nindicators , so that we can truly become a quality telecom hub of Asia .\n\n\nOnly then will consumers , operators and Hong Kong as a whole have\nthe chance to win . \n\n \n\n Simon Chan is the chairman of the Hong Kong\nTelecommunications Users Group , representing business telecom users to the\nSAR government .\n\n\nThe group  ' s Web site is at www.hktug.org .

creativity , add value to our\nindustries and strengthen our competitiveness . \n\n \n\nHong Kong  ' s industries and entrepreneurs , supported by the\ngovernment , are moving forward with efforts to improve efficiency , increase\nproductivity and utilise resources that have a capacity to create value .\n\n\n \n\nMany of these resources have been put in place by the government\n- the HK&dollar;5 billion Innovation and Technology Fund (  ITF ) set up in\n1999; the HK&dollar;750 million Applied Research Fund to support local\ntechnology ventures with commercial potential; the Hong Kong Science and\nTechnology Parks Corporation to provide one-stop infrastructure support to\ntechnology-based companies and activities; and the Hong Kong Applied Science\nand Technology Research Institute Company Limited , which conducts research\nand development for transfer to industry for commercialisation . \n\n \n\nSince the launch of the ITF , there has been more corporate\nparticipation in applied R&D .\n\n\nIn 1997 , corporate contributions to public-sector R&D were only\nHK&dollar;1 to HK&dollar;25 from the government .\n\n\nThis has now become more encouraging: the ratio has increased to\nHK&dollar;1 to HK&dollar;5.5 from the fund . \n\n \n\nThe Small Entrepreneur Research Assistance Programme under the\nITF has helped promote technological entrepreneurship by providing seed money\nto start-ups with sound research ideas that can be turned into commercially\nviable businesses . \n\n \n\nThe benefits of the ITF support have also become noticeable .\n\n\nA range of new technologies has been developed from ITF-funded\nprojects , providing an innovative boost to the local industry . \n\n \n\nIn the information technology sector , the results of one project\nhave offered a solution to conducting electronic transactions over the\nInternet .\n\n\nThis has since become a building block in public key infrastructure ,\nensuring the quality and legality of electronic transactions .\n\n\nAnother example is the development of a Web-based technology for the\nnews media , which has given a kickstart to the provision of electronic news\narchiving and newspaper-cutting services . \n\n \n\nIn the electronics industry , several projects have led to the\ndevelopment of technologies related to the packaging process .\n\n\nThese are essential to product miniaturisation and performance\nimprovement and enable local manufacturers to produce printed circuit boards\nof high component densities . \n\n \n\nAnd for the foundation industries , the development of a\nfree-form machining technology has helped local manufacturers to migrate from\nthe development of traditional optical products to high-end products . \n\n \n\nThese are just a handful of examples of how innovation and\ntechnology are transforming Hong Kong  ' s industries to take advantage of the\ninformation age .\n\n\nAnd it is just the beginning . \n\n \n\nA sound infrastructure is essential if innovation and technology\nare to flourish .\n\n\nThe Innovation and Technology Commission (  ITC ) is helping to make\nthis possible by facilitating the provision of appropriate technological\ninfrastructure and promoting applied R&D and technology transfer and\napplication . \n\n \n\nThe Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation  ' s\nincubation programme nurtures technology start-ups , while its Science Park ,\nopened in June last year , provides premises and services for applied R&D\nactivities . \n\n \n\nThe Science Park is a cluster-style development with electronics\n, information technology and telecommunications , biotechnology and precision\nengineering as the four initial clusters .\n\n\nIt is creating a focal point and a conducive environment in which\ntechnology-based firms can operate successfully .\n\n\nThe Science Park is beginning to provide a new impetus for Hong Kong  ' s\nindustrial development . \n\n \n\nSo far , some 25 companies have been approved for admission to\nthe park .\n\n\nTogether with a number of prospective tenants , more than 60 per cent\nof the Phase 1 development has been earmarked for occupation . \n\n \n\nThe publicly funded Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology\nResearch Institute (  Astri ) began operating in 2001 .\n\n\nIts task is to carry out research and development that can be\ntransferred to industry for commercialisation . \n\n \n\nThe institute  ' s research programmes have initially focused on\nphotonics technologies , integrated circuit design , wireless communication ,\nInternet software and biotechnology .\n\n\nIt is carrying out seven research projects in the areas of Internet\nsoftware , photonics and wireless technologies .\n\n\nOne project involves the development of technology to enable\ninteractive learning of spoken English on the Internet . \n\n \n\nThe Hong Kong Jockey Club Institute of Chinese Medicine ,\nincorporated in May 2001 as a subsidiary company of Astri , is advancing the\nvision of positioning Hong Kong as a world centre for the development of\nhealth food and pharmaceuticals based on Chinese medicine .\n\n\nAnd the Hong Kong Productivity Council plans to focus on integrated\nsupport to innovative and growth-oriented Hong Kong firms across the value\nchain , particularly in relation to manufacturing and related services .\n\n\nIts main geographical focus will be Hong Kong and the Pearl River\nDelta . \n\n \n\nThe ITC has also supported the establishment of the Hong Kong\nDesign Centre to provide a focal point for the promotion of design as a\nvalue-added tool in raising design standards and the profile of Hong Kong as\nan innovative and creative hub in the region .\n\n\nThis will assist with the integration of design into mainstream\nbusiness processes and help industry move up the value chain . \n\n \n\nThe government  ' s initiatives and programmes on promoting\ninnovation and technology are progressing well , with a wide acceptance of\nthe value of innovative and creative thinking in broadening Hong Kong  ' s\neconomic activities . \n\n \n\nWe will continue to support innovation and technology as an\neconomic driver , as well as promoting university-industry collaboration in\nR&D and encouraging the private sector to invest and engage more in R&D\nactivities .\n\n\nFurther collaboration with the mainland will enable us to tap into\nthe scientific capabilities and technological opportunities in China .\n\n\nThis will bring benefits to both Hong Kong and the mainland .

{"text": "Hong Kong needs to lick its private medical sector into\nshape before it can become Asia  ' s doctor , reports  Ella Lee \n  \n\n\n  Economy class: Patients share a crowded ward in the\nPrecious Blookd Hospital in Samshuipo .  SCMP Picture \n\n\n  Reform prescribed for health-hub plan  \n\n\n\n  IN A RECENT  speech to leading doctors , Financial\nSecretary Antony Leung Kam-chung revealed the Government  ' s mission to turn\nHong Kong into a health-care services hub for Asia . \n\n\n\n The ambitious plan would involve the SAR  ' s leading private doctors using\ntheir specialist skills to attract wealthy patients from overseas , much as\nthe US does . \n\n\n\n But the proposal , backed by Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa and Secretary\nfor Health and Welfare Dr Yeoh Eng-kiong , has met a lukewarm response from\ndoctors in the private sector . \n\n\n\n While private doctors support the idea in principle , many say the\nGovernment is putting the cart before the horse .\n\n\nBefore Hong Kong can become Asia  ' s doctor , they say , it needs to\nget its private health-care sector into shape . \n\n\n\n Doctors agree with Mr Leung that the private sector can improve\nefficiency and offer patients more choice .\n\n\nBut they argue that the imbalance between the private and the - much\nlarger - public sector must be tackled before the Government  ' s aims can be\nachieved . \n\n\n\n Health care is big business .\n\n\nMedical treatment is expensive and patients are willing to spend to\nensure good health .\n\n\nHong Kong  ' s health-care expenditure constitutes five per cent of\ngross domestic product , or about &dollar;56 billion a year .\n\n\nOf that , about 46 per cent , or at least &dollar;25 billion , is\nspent in the private market . \n\n\n\n As Mr Leung pointed out , the United States has been very successful at\nselling health-care services to patients around the world .\n\n\nThose who can afford it shop for the most up-to-date treatment in the\nUS .\n\n\nSome even travel there for routine check-ups . \n\n\n\n In Asia , Singapore is moving in the same direction , developing the\nrequired specialist medical skills .\n\n\nSingapore has sent doctors and nurses to many parts of the region to\nset up clinics providing direct treatment .\n\n\n\" Today , as it happens , Hong Kong is the largest exporter of\naccounting services to the mainland .\n\n\nIn 10 years ' time , we could also be the largest exporter of\nhealth-care services , &rdquo; Mr Leung said . \n\n\n\n But the president of the Medical Association , Dr Lo Wing-lok , said the\nGovernment must reduce the size of the public health-care sector before the\nprivate sector can flourish . \n\n\n\n Dr Lo , also the legislator representing the medical sector , said the\nvery cheap and good services provided by public clinics and hospitals meant\nmost patients were not willing to spend on private health care , making it\ndifficult for private doctors to invest in their services. \n\n\n\n The SAR Government subsidises 98 per cent of health-care costs in public\nhospitals . \n\n\n\n About 93 per cent of all hospital in-patients are treated by the public\nsector .\n\n\nPatients are paying only &dollar;68 a day for a hospital bed ,\nincluding all consultation fees , drugs and food .\n\n\nAnd the price is the same whether a patient is having a simple\noperation or a liver transplant . \n\n\n\n A general out-patient consultation and a specialist consultation at\npublic clinics cost just &dollar;37 and &dollar;44 . \n\n\n\n According to a Medical Association survey in March last year , the\naverage fee for a visit to a private general practitioner is &dollar;170 ,\nwhile specialists charge between &dollar;350 and &dollar;500 for a basic\nconsultation . \n\n\n\n With the number of patients rising , the Hospital Authority is facing a\nbudget deficit for the first time since it was set up in 1991 . \n\n\n\n The authority  ' s chief executive , Dr William Ho Shiu-wei , said recently\nhe projected a &dollar;225 million deficit this financial year .\n\n\nAuthority executives and officials are scratching their heads about\nhow to tackle the problem . \n\n\n\n The most likely solution , but also the one most resisted by the public ,\nis a rise in charges . \n\n\n\n Dr Lo said it was not valid for Mr Leung to compare Singapore with Hong\nKong .\n\n\nSingapore has a medical savings scheme and a voluntary insurance\nscheme , under which citizens save for their medical expenses . \n\n\n\n \" Singapore has a rather different model .\n\n\nCitizens can use their own contribution in the medical-care account\nin the private sector , so the private sector is very active and strong , and\nit can further invest in equipment and skills to treat overseas patients ,\n&rdquo; Dr Lo said . \n\n\n\n \" In Hong Kong , it is risky to invest millions of dollars on\nadvanced equipment because you may not know if there is a customer .\n\n\nThe private sector is so weak , many superstar doctors choose to stay\nwith public hospitals or universities . &rdquo; \n\n\n\n Dr Lo believes Hong Kong should have a clear position on private health\ncare . \n\n\n\n \" Before we can turn it into a regional centre , we need to fix the\ninternal market .\n\n\nAnd the Government should no longer see health care as welfare , but\nan industry it wants to develop . &rdquo; \n\n\n\n He said doctors also had to upgrade their skills to make private medical\nservices more attractive .\n\n\nBetter-off patients were always there to shop for quality services .\n\n\n\n\n For example , more and more doctors were learning how to treat mood\ndisorders - a product of the economic downturn - while others were expanding\ninto cosmetic surgery , and even ear-piercing . \n\n\n\n Dr Gabriel Choi Kin , president of the Practising Estate Doctors'\nAssociation , is even more critical of the health-care hub idea , calling it\n\" something proposed by laymen who do not know very much about our\nprofession\" . \n\n\n\n \" The financial crisis means many patients in Malaysia , Indonesia\nor Thailand are not seeking expensive treatment overseas .\n\n\nSingapore also suffers from the decline in the number of wealthy\npatients , &rdquo; Dr Choi said . \n\n\n\n The Government has also suggested that Hong Kong  ' s doctors should\n\" export &rdquo; their services to the mainland . \n\n\n\n But Dr Choi said: \" Most Hong Kong doctors are not keen to practise\nin the mainland .\n\n\nThere are a lot of restrictions in licensing for Hong Kong doctors\nthere . &rdquo; \n\n\n\n Dr Walton Li Wai-tat , president of the Private Hospitals ' Association ,\nsaid that with the large price differences between public and private\nhospitals , private hospitals could never compete on a level playing field .\n\n\n\n\n \" The Hospital Authority should list the priority of services it\nprovides so patients will not have unrealistic expectations , &rdquo; Dr Li\nsaid . \n\n\n\n \" Private hospitals can supplement services that public hospitals\n\n\n\n  ELITE SUITE: The most expensive room at Happy Valley  ' s\nSanitorium and Hospital .

' \n\n\n\n One aspect reflecting our poor sense of belonging to nature , according\nto Yiu , is the heavy use of bleach in warding off the Sars virus .\n\n\n\n'  ' We  ' re killing many viruses and bacteria , including those that\nmay be beneficial to humans .\n\n\nAnd the bleach may pollute fish and seafood .\n\n\nEventually (  the effects of ) the pollutants could come back to us\nlike a boomerang,' ' says Yiu , a member of the Lamma Island Environmentally\nConcerned Group . \n\n\n\n He and his brother , Ron Yiu Kun-yat , a co-owner of Green Cottage , will\ncampaign against the use of bleach and raise awareness about green living on\nLamma later this month .\n\n\nThe campaign involves free distribution to Lamma residents of\nhydrogen peroxide and baking soda - less harmful alternatives for cleaning ,\nthey say . \n\n\n\n  '   ' These cleaning agents are more environmentally friendly .\n\n\nThey decompose quicker than bleach and don't create as many harmful\nelements to nature,' ' says Ron Yiu , who is also a member of the group .\n\n\n\n'  ' I think the government is pushing the environment to its limit by\ncalling on people to use bleach every day.' ' \n\n\n\n The brothers , whose island has seen a flood of local visitors since the\nSars outbreak , say they have witnessed more harmful acts against nature than\nthe use of bleach . \n\n\n\n  '   ' Many people now go to the countryside instead of shopping malls at\nweekends .\n\n\nBut some of them are only moving to a different venue to practise\ntheir habits .\n\n\nThey eat and drink , throw away rubbish and spit as usual,' ' Dan Yiu\nsays .\n\n\n\n'  ' Many people may take more vitamin C and less antibiotics , but I\ndon't think their underlying attitude towards nature has changed .\n\n\nConsumerism still takes precedence over nature.' ' \n\n\n\n But Man Chi-sum , the chief executive of Green Power , is more upbeat .\n\n\n\n'  ' There are good things coming out of Sars,' ' he says .\n\n\n\n'  ' Many people have actually shown more care towards their\nsurrounding environment and the community .\n\n\nThey have also become more health-conscious.' ' \n\n\n\n Man is optimistic that a change of attitude towards the environment will\npersist with the rising threat of health crises .\n\n\n\n'  ' Sars is hard to eradicate,' ' he says .\n\n\n\n'  ' And with summer approaching , a recurrence of the dengue fever\noutbreak is looming .\n\n\nI believe people will continue to stay health-conscious and care\nmore about the environment than before .\n\n\nBut of course the change won't happen overnight.' ' \n\n\n\n Vegetarian Society of Hong Kong president Simon Chau Siu-cheong , one of\nthe pioneers in promoting green living in Hong Kong , says the outbreak is\nmore than a warning .\n\n\n\n'  ' It  ' s an ultimatum for us to change our lifestyle,' ' he says .\n\n\n\n'  ' Nature is telling us that if we don't acknowledge our\nrelationship with it and make changes , we will sooner or later die from\ndifferent kinds of virus .\n\n\nWe deserve the Sars outbreak because we have been leading an\nunhealthy life: we don't take enough rest; we eat too much meat; we depend on\ndoctors too much .\n\n\nAnd we don't respect nature .\n\n\nFor us , nature is to be consumed , not protected .\n\n\nBut it will get back at us , like it has done with Sars.' ' \n\n\n\n Chau , who advocates living a simple life that features no mobile phone\nand no television at home , calls on people to make revolutionary changes to\ntheir lifestyle .\n\n\nHis suggestions include cutting consumption of meat and making\nfrequent visits to the countryside instead of shopping malls .\n\n\nHe also suggests avoiding air travel .\n\n\n\n'  ' It is detrimental to our health and to the environment,' ' Chau\nsays . \n\n\n\n  '   ' We have to consider that Hong Kong is a city,' ' says Man .\n\n\n\n'  ' While we should encourage people to get closer to nature , we\nalso need to engage in economic activities .\n\n\nWe can't hide ourselves up a mountain .\n\n\nWe can't avoid taking public transport .\n\n\nWhat is most important is to strike a balance between green living\nand living in a city . \n\n\n\n  '   ' The least we can do is maintain good personal hygiene .\n\n\nPeople should stop combing their hair and snipping their fingernails\non the MTR , which is ridiculous in a developed place .\n\n\nSome couples even squeeze each other  ' s spots .\n\n\nIt  ' s not only a disgusting sight , it may also spread disease.''\n\n\n\n\n The Yiu brothers , however , believe all behavioural changes boil down to\npeople  ' s respect for nature . \n\n\n\n  '   ' We  ' re part of nature,' ' says Ron Yiu .\n\n\n\n'  ' What nature gives us is usually the best , and if we are reckless\nwith it , eventually we  ' ll be the ones who suffer .\n\n\nWhen we understand this , our behaviour will change naturally.''", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d69160d2-274e-4af7-86f0-40dbc4fa05fb", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.996340+00:00"}

and puts it down to a blessing from \" heaven\" . \n\n <#69:1> Medical experts believe improved social conditions , healthcare ,\na healthy lifestyle and a traditional diet of rice , vegetables and little\nmeat have all helped Hong Kong  ' s elderly to live longer . \n\n <#70:1> An ongoing study of healthy ageing conducted since the early\n1990s by the Chinese University  ' s department of community and family\nmedicine shows most centenarians share a number of characteristics - their\ndiet , moderate but regular exercise and an early-to-bed , early-to-rise\nphilosophy .\n<#71:1> They also tend to be optimistic and stress free . \n\n <#72:1> According to the  Guinness Book of Records  , the world  ' s\noldest person is American Maude Ferris-Luse , aged 114 .\n<#73:1> The oldest fully authenticated person ever was Jeanne Louise Calment\n, who died aged 122 in 1997 .\n<#74:1> In Hong Kong , there is no official record of the oldest person .\n\n\n <#75:1> Chan Cho-chak , 105 , is sitting on his sofa in his bedroom in\nBroadcast Drive , Kowloon Tong , reading his  Beneficial To The World\nEssays Collection  , a compilation of newspaper articles he wrote in the\n1960s .\n<#76:1> He is talking non-stop and ignores my questions . \n\n <#77:1> \" This book has everything: relationships , society and\neconomy , ethnics and general subjects .\n<#78:1> Look , it even talks about divorce and care of animals... everything\nyou can think of , &rdquo; he says softly . \n\n <#79:1> Ignoring me again - I later realise he is virtually deaf - he\nflips through the pages of the book and talks about the problems of gambling\n, smoking and drugs .\n<#80:1> Then he boasts about the long history of China and about Emperor Qin\nShihuang , who ordered a party of virgins under Xu Fu to sail to Japan in a\ndisastrous quest for an elixir for long life . \n\n <#81:1> Chan then tells me about Sun Yat-sen  ' s revolution , then about\nhow \" the British used the Opium Wars to poison Chinese people\" .\n<#82:1> Suddenly , he  ' s talking about Chinese pirate Cheung Po-tsai , then\nworld peace . \n\n <#83:1> Born in the year William McKinley became the 25th president of\nthe United States , Chan was the youngest child of a scholarly family .\n<#84:1> He remembers the first lightbulb his family had and the first car in\nHong Kong .\n<#85:1> He remembers wearing a long pigtails as a boy and that Sun was his\nidol . \n\n <#86:1> Chan worked as a tailor in Guangzhou and studied at night .\n<#87:1> When he was a teenager , he volunteered as a revolutionary soldier in\nthe hope of emulating Sun and marched from Guangxi to Beijing but before he\nreached the capital , the enemy won and he had to flee .\n<#88:1> In 1917 , he arrived in Hong Kong as a refugee and 14 years later\nfounded the Chan Kan Woon Department Store .\n<#89:1> The business thrived and he opened six branches .\n<#90:1> In the 50s , he helped open a free school for girls funded by the Lok\nSin Tong Benevolent Society and devoted his life to charity work .\n<#91:1> Last year , he became the oldest person to be named on the SAR  ' s\nhonours list when he received the Medal of Honour for his service to the\ncommunity which included 73 years of charity work with the society . \n\n <#92:1> Apart from using his brain as much as possible , he tells me the\nother secret of long life .\n<#93:1> \" Not to have so much sex , &rdquo; he says . \n\n <#94:1>  \" Yiu Yick-cheung (  below ) never lost her temper , I  ' ve\nnever seen her angry and she never flights with others .\n<#95:1> Even if it is other people  ' s fault , she would say sorry &rdquo;\n  \n\n <#96:1> \" Then why do you have two wives ? &rdquo; whispers Lin Tse\n, a fellow-villager who cares for him .\n<#97:1> Chan has nine children , 27 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren\nin Canada , Australia , New Zealand , the US and Britain . \n\n <#98:1> Yuk Yick-cheung , 103 , started seeing her friends die during her\n50s and by the time she was 90 , she was the last of her circle left .\n<#99:1> Last November , her youngest son passed away .\n<#100:1> \" I think I will die before my mother dies , &rdquo; says her\neldest son , Wong Hoi , 76 . \n\n <#101:1> Yiu was born in Xinhui , a Guangdong village where her father\ngave her a boy  ' s name , Yick-cheung , as she was the family  ' s only daughter .\n<#102:1> Sitting in her armchair , Yiu wears a shimmering purple jacket and\nher woolen hat she knitted herself .\n<#103:1> When Yiu talks , she sometimes falls asleep . It is difficult to\ntalk to her , but her son helps . \n\n <#104:1> \" She asked you how you have had such a long life ,\n&rdquo; he says slowly and loudly into her ear .\n<#105:1> Yiu hears her son and say \" I always pray , I have a good\nheart and I am careful with food . &rdquo; \n\n <#106:1> Yiu has a simple diet .\n<#107:1> She starts the day with cereal and bread; for lunch she eats white\nrice , fish , pork and lots of vegetables .\n<#108:1> But she makes sure she only eats until she is half-full and avoids\ngreasy food . After meals , she eats half an orange . \n\n <#109:1> Wong has another explanation for her longevity: his mother grew\nup with the comforts of a rich family .\n<#110:1> \" She ate a lot of Chinese delicacies , birds and ginseng when\nshe was young , &rdquo; he says .\n<#111:1> Wong also believes her temperament plays a part .\n<#112:1> \" She is very optimistic , &rdquo; he says .\n<#113:1> \" She never lost her temper , I  ' ve never seen her angry and\nshe never fights with others .\n<#114:1> Even if it is other people  ' s fault , she would say sorry . &rdquo;\n\n\n <#115:1> Yiu lost her wealth during the Japanese occupation and came to\nHong Kong in 1947 , where she worked in a garment factory .\n<#116:1> Today , she and her son live in a Kwai Hing public-housing estate on\nsocial security .\n<#117:1> She can't recognize people in old photographs , including her own\nson .\n<#118:1> Nor can she recalls dates but she retains vivid memories of her\nchildhood . \n\n <#119:1> She went to school for a few years when she was small .\n<#120:1> \" Only rich people could study , &rdquo; she says .\n<#121:1> \" We had 10 in a class and people quit after they felt they\nlearned enough . &rdquo;\n<#122:1> Asked what she learned at school , she recites the traditional\nrhyming Confucian-like essay,  San Zi Jing  : \"  Yan zi\ncho , saint bui sin  (  At the start , human beings ' nature is kind... ]\n&rdquo;\n<#123:1> She recites cheerfully , as if she has regained her youth . \n\n <#124:1> Meanwhile , Lai is awake now and on her way home from the\nrestaurant with her gold pendant .\n<#125:1> These days , she takes a taxi .\n<#126:1> Holding the handrail and her walker , Lai slowly climbs the stairs\nto her second-floor village house . \n\n <#127:1> Has she enjoyed living so long ?\n<#128:1> \" It doesn't matter if I like it or not ' &rdquo; she says .\n\n\n <#129:1>  sherryl@scmp.com", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "92398b14-b4eb-4475-aafd-071158c5f18d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:52.998420+00:00"}
{"text": "1A \n \n\nThere are a number of different approaches to the study of word\nmeaning .\n\n\nThese include the componential approach , procedural approach ,\nsemantic-network approach , semantic differential approach , feature\ncomparison approach , etc .\n\n\nAmong them some are more inclined towards the linguistic sphere\nwhereas some are inclined towards the psychological one .\n\n\nOf course there are also some which are somewhere in between the two .\n\n\nThe &lsquo; prototype &rsquo; model is also one approach to the study\nof word meaning .\n\n\nIn this approach , the meaning of a word is defined by its most\nprototypical member .\n\n\nAn instance of this would be to say that a robin is the prototype of\nbirds .\n\n\nIt is taken to be the prototype because it possesses all those\nimportant characteristics which allow it to be regarded as a bird .\n\n\nHowever , a potential problem with this approach is that sometimes it\nis hard to decide what should be taken as the prototype of a certain word .\n\n\nFor instance , one might argue why robin , instead of nightingale ,\nis chosen to be the prototype while indeed the two possess virtually similar\ncharacteristics .\n\n\nOne might question the validity of choosing a particular member to be\nthe most typical representative .\n\n\nAnother problem is that for some words indeed there can be no\nprototype .\n\n\nThis is especially the case with those parts of speech other than\nnouns , such as verbs , adjectives , adverbs , etc .\n\n\nEven with the noun category , sometimes it is difficult to decide\nwhether or not there is a prototype for a certain noun .\n\n\nLet us take for instance the word &lsquo; \" game \"\n&rsquo; .\n\n\nNot only does it pose problem for approaches such as the componential\napproach , it also raises doubts as to the validity of the prototype model .\n\n\nSince there is no common characteristics or features that must be\npossessed among the members of \" game&rdquo; , it is impossible to pick\nout any single candidate to be the prototype of &lsquo; \" game\n\" &rsquo; .\n\n\nNo single member of the word &lsquo; \" game \"\n&rsquo; can claim to possess the necessary characteristics for any to be\nqualified as &lsquo; \" game \" &rsquo; .\n\n\nBecause , take for instance , not all games are played for the sake\nof fun , not all games involve competition , the number of participants is\nalso indefinite , etc .\n\n\nFrom the above we can get a glimpse of what limitation the &lsquo;\nprototype &rsquo; model has .  \n\n\n1B \n \n\nDuring comprehension , there are different levels of processing .\n\n\nAmong them there is the stage of syntactic processing .\n\n\nThe &lsquo; verb complexity &rsquo; hypothesis of syntactic\nprocessing states that the rate of comprehension is affected by the\ncomplexity of the verb .\n\n\nA verb is said to be more complex if it allows a number of different\nalternatives to what follows in the sentence .\n\n\nIn this sense , the verb &lsquo; \" know \" &rsquo; is\nmore complex than the verb &lsquo; \" die \" &rsquo; .\n\n\nFor instance , a sentence which starts with &lsquo; \" John\nknows \" &rsquo; can be followed by different types of construction .\n\n\nIt may end up in this way: &lsquo; \" John knows Mary\n\" &rsquo; .\n\n\nIt may be followed by a that-clause , e.g .\" John knows that\nMary is lawyer \" .\n\n\nThere are still other possible alternatives to complete the sentence .\n\n\nWhen we turn to the verb &lsquo; \" die \" &rsquo; ,\nwe find that what can follow is of limited possibility .\n\n\nWe may only end up the sentence like this : \" John died at an\nearly age \" .\n\n\nOther construction such as &lsquo; \" John died last year\n\" &rsquo; or &lsquo; \" John died in San Francisco \"\n&rsquo; are all of a similar nature .\n\n\nWhat follows can only be some time or place adverbial or something\nlike that .\n\n\nThe verb &lsquo; \" die \" &rsquo; cannot be followed\ndirectly by a that-clause .\n\n\nThus comparatively speaking the verb &lsquo; \" know\n\" &rsquo; is much more complex than the verb &lsquo; \" die\n\" &rsquo; .\n\n\nIt is proposed that as the complexity of a verb increases , the\ndifficulty of comprehension is also increased within such argument it is\nbelieved that verb complexity can thus decide on the length of time required\nfor comprehension .\n\n\nIt follows that a sentence with a verb like &lsquo; \" know\n\" &rsquo; will take much longer for one to comprehend than that with\na verb like &lsquo; \" hit \" &rsquo; .\n\n\nYet , actual findings show us that indeed the two sentences just take\nmore or less the same duration of time for one to comprehend .\n\n\nThus the validity of the &lsquo; verb complexity &rsquo; hypothesis\nis in question .  \n\n\n1C \n \n\nIn studying language comprehension , an utterance is said to have\nits &lsquo; locutionary meaning &rsquo; , &lsquo; illocutionary force &rsquo;\nand &lsquo; perlocutionary effect &rsquo; .\n\n\nThe &lsquo; locutionary meaning &rsquo; of an utterance refers to\nwhat the word literally means .\n\n\nIn this sense an utterance like &lsquo; \" I can't find any\nsalt \" &rsquo; is only expressing a situation .\n\n\nHowever , we have to always take into consideration the &lsquo;\nillocutionary force &rsquo; of an utterance .\n\n\nThis refers to more than what is literally expressed .\n\n\nFor instance , a sentence like the above may be used to ask someone\nto pass some salt to him/her .\n\n\n&lsquo; Illocutionary force &rsquo; refers to the intended meaning\nbehind an utterance .\n\n\nSimilarly , a sentence like &lsquo; \" It  ' s so hot in here\n\" &rsquo; might be intended to ask someone to turn on the fan .\n\n\nIn addition to the above two aspects , an utterance can also have its\n&lsquo; perlocutionary effect &rsquo; .\n\n\nSuch effect might indeed not be intended by the speaker , but is   inferred  by the listener .\n\n\nIn this sense the listener is making inferences on what the speaker\nsays .\n\n\nThe meaning is not intended by the speaker .\n\n\nFor example , someone saying &lsquo; \" I like to eat\nice-cream \" &rsquo; might be interpreted by someone else to mean\nthat he/she wants someone to buy him/her an icecream .\n\n\nThe distinction between &lsquo; illocutionary force &rsquo; and\n&lsquo; perlocutionary effect &rsquo; is whether the meaning conveyed behind\nliteral words is intended by the speaker himself/herself or not .  \n\n\n1D \n \n\nSpeech is uttered with a primarily communicative purpose .\n\n\nTherefore Grice raised some maxims in which one should follow in\ncommunications .\n\n\nThey are called The maxims of the Gricean Principle .\n\n\nThese include the maxim of quality , the maxim of quantity , the\nmaxim of relation , etc .\n\n\nThe maxim of quality states that one should only say what is true ,\nin accordance with what he/she really knows .\n\n\nThe maxim of quantity states that one should not say less than\nrequired , similarly , one should not say more than enough .\n\n\nThe maxim of relation states that one should take into consideration\nthe relationship between the speaker and hearer .\n\n\nThis determines the form and style of one  ' s speech .\n\n\nFor instance , it is clear that the situations will be quite\ndifferent when one is talking to one  ' s classmates , and say , talking to the\npresident .\n\n\nAlso , one should think about what effect is to be created in the\nhearer .\n\n\nThis determines his choice of tone , and sentence type , etc .\n\n\nFor instance , the effect of an imperative sentence is obviously more\nforceful than a mild request .\n\n\nNevertheless , the above maxims can be violated in order to achieve\nsome special communicative effects .\n\n\nFor instance , if the speaker wants to arouse and suspend the hearer  ' s\ninterest , he/she might say less than enough to achieve that purpose .\n\n\nIn doing so he/she is flouting the maxim of quantity .\n\n\nIn order to prevent somebody from knowing the truth , which might\ninduce some undesirable effect , one might say a white lie intentionally .\n\n\nAgain the speaker is flouting the maxim of quality .\n\n\nIn addition , ironic statements ,   sarcastic\n statements are also a violation of the Gricean principle .\n\n\nSometimes when we want to express our hatred towards somebody , we\nmight also flout the maxim of relation .\n\n\nAs a whole , we can see that strict abeyance to the maxims are not\noften required .\n\n\nIt is not unusual to violate them in order to achieve special\ncommunicative purpose .  \n\n\n2 \n \n\nIn discourse comprehension , unlike sentence comprehension ,\n&lsquo; inference &rsquo; always plays an important role in it .\n\n\nAlthough we start comprehension as soon as it is possible , not until\nany syntactic boundaries , this does not mean that we can only achieve\ncomprehension in a word by word order. Indeed as soon as we start\ncomprehension , we also assumes making inference all along .\n\n\nFor instance , when we meet a verb , say &lsquo; \" laugh\n\" &rsquo; in a sentence within a discourse , we will start making\ninference about what may come after that .\n\n\nWe might infer that what follows must be something happy , or even\nfunny , etc .\n\n\nNot only does a word allow us to make inference , so is the case with\nsome large units such as a phrase , a clause , or even a whole sentence .\n\n\nAs we go along , inference might help us to predict what will be\ncoming in the discourse . \n \n\nIt is important to note that inference can be of either syntactic\nor semantic nature .\n\n\nSyntactically speaking , the nature of say , a verb , will allow us\nto draw inference about what will be coming in that single sentence .\n\n\nFor instance , whether the verb is a transitive , intransitive or a\nditransitive one will help us infer what comes next .\n\n\nIf we see the verb &lsquo; \" give \" &rsquo; , we\nwill know that what comes after could not be a noun alone .\n\n\nThere must be the so-called &lsquo; theme &rsquo; and &lsquo;\nrecipient &rsquo; , such as\" John gives Mary the apple \" .\n\n\nIn addition , those connectives also allow us to draw inference .\n\n\nExamples include\" because since , nevertheless , but ,\ntherefore , so \" , etc .\n\n\nThese words allow us to infer the causal relationship between\nsentences , and thus partly help us to predict what comes next .\n\n\nSeeing words such as &lsquo;

{"text": "Time for Beijing to recognise Legco  \n\n \n\nTHE British Prime Minister , Mr John Major , said in his press\nconference in Hong Kong after visiting Beijing that he had urged the Chinese\nGovernment to recognize the status of the Omelco. His words have somehow\nraised optimism that the warming Sino-British relations would help Omelco\ngain Beijing  ' s recognition . \n\n \n\nIt is now time to rethink the whole issue of the Omelco  ' s status,\nnot because of Mr Major  ' s words but the fundamentally altered nature of the\nLegislative Council after this month  ' s direct elections . \n\n \n\nIn the eyes of Beijing officials , the Executive and Legislative\nCouncils of Hong Kong are colonial establishments and they do not represent\nthe opinions or interests of Hong Kong people . \n\n \n\nYes , they were colonial institutions .\n\n\nBefore 1985 , all unofficial members of the Exco and the Legco were\nhandpicked by the Governor .\n\n\nThey were not there to represent the citizens , nor to rule or oppose\n, but to assist the governance of the colony . \n\n \n\nThe Chinese leaders were never shy about their attitude towards\nthe councillors .\n\n\nBack in 1982 , Mr Deng Xiaoping bluntly told Sir Sze-yuen Chung , the\nthen Senior Exco Member who led an Umelco delegation to Beijing , that they\ndid not represent the people of Hong Kong .\n\n\nIn 1988 and 1989 , when the now defunct Basic Law Consultative\nCommittee was canvassing public opinion on the draft Basic Law , the Omelco  ' s\nposition papers were given no special status .\n\n\nAnd last year when an the Omelco delegation visited Guangdong , they\nwere not received in its official capacity . \n\n \n\nGiven the nature of the Omelco , nobody should have any illusion\nthat Beijing would accept its representativeness .\n\n\nHowever, the 18 newly elected members returned by popular votes\nearlier this month have put Legco on a completely different footing . \n\n\n\n Opportunities Exposed  \n\n \n\nAlmost one-third of the Legco members are now directly elected ,\nsignificantly raising its legitimacy as a representative public forum .\n\n\nThis is also a giant step for Hong Kong in shredding its colonial\npast as far as public policy formulation is concerned . \n\n \n\nIn addition , the composition of the Legco is already close to\nthe first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\nas stipulated in the Basic Law .\n\n\nThe new Legco should take advantage of its new composition , its\nadded legitimacy and the recovering Sino-British relations to open a dialogue\nwith the Chinese authorities on the issue of its status . \n\n \n\nOn the other hand , it is also time for Beijing to rethink its\npolicy on the Omelco .\n\n\nTo continue refusing to establish links with the Legco is not in Hong\nKong  ' s best interest . \n\n \n\nBeijing might still be wary of the politicians who organized\nrallies in support of the Beijing student demonstrations in 1989 .\n\n\nBut it should be noted that quite a number of them have toned down\ntheir criticisms on China in their election campaigns .\n\n\nAnd almost none of them had tried to exploit radical anti-China\nslogans in their campaigns to market themselves to the electorate .\n\n\nIt could be argued that these are gestures of good will . \n\n \n\nThe climate is about right to mend fences .\n\n\nGiven the fact that there are only six years before Hong Kong people\nrule their own place , it is high time for the British and Chinese\nGovernments to cooperate in breeding the right leadership here . \n\n \n\nThe emergence of a core of political leaders takes time but\nobviously time is not on the side of Hong Kong .\n\n\nAs long as the past relations between Beijing and the Legco is not\nchanged , the Legco will not be able to assume an effective leadership role\nin the transition period and whether the ideal of \" Hong Kong people\nruling Hong Kong &rdquo; could be materialized will be thrown into doubt .\n \n\n\n Contradictory Policies  \n\n \n\n\" Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong &rdquo; is the official\npolicy of Beijing on Hong Kong after 1997 .\n\n\nBut what was exemplified in the airport controversy -; that both\nthe autonomy of the Hong Kong Government and the role of Legco were\ndiminished -; has cast doubts on how successful the policy could be\nimplemented in the future . \n\n \n\nApart from the much-mentioned worries that Beijing will get used\nto meddling in the domestic matters of Hong Kong from now on , the minimal\nrole of the Hong Kong Government and the Legco in resolving the controversy\nhad also clouded the confidence of Hong Kong people . \n\n \n\nThe controversy surrounding the Chek Lap Kok new airport was\nfinally resolved through diplomatic channels between China and Britain .\n\n\nThe squabble did not officially end until the top leaders of the two\ncountries signed the Memorandum of Understanding in Beijing . \n\n \n\nAll along , banking on the repeated mistakes of the Hong Kong\nGovernment , Beijing gave an impression that it deliberately tried to , and\nsuccessfully , shun the Hong Kong Government and take the issue to the\nhighest diplomatic level . \n\n \n\nThe dispute dramatically resolved after the visit of Sir Percy\nCradock , the Prime Minister  ' s Foreign Affairs Adviser , to Beijing. And it\ntook the Prime Minister to fly to the Chinese capital to sign a memorandum of\nunderstanding , which is not a particularly high level diplomatic document ,\non an airport project in a tiny colony . \n\n \n\nOf course one can argue that the airport project is vital to the\nstability and prosperity of Hong Kong and Hong Kong is the single most\nimportant issue between London and Beijing .\n\n\nBut nonetheless Beijing  ' s policy on the airport controversy is\nwidely perceived as not merely an attempt to strike a dea1 on the airport\nproper but also a grand initiative to reverse diplomatic adversity against\nLondon . \n\n \n\nNo doubt Beijing has won the battle .\n\n\nBut the price may be a bit too high for Hong Kong as it was left with\na much diminished autonomy in administering the project on its own . \n\n \n\nThe airport committee under the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group\nhas replaced the Government House and the Lower Albert Road on major\ndecisions and the airport consultative committee has effectively displaced\nthe Legislative Council in monitoring the project .\n\n\nThis problematic scenario brings us back to the discussion of the new\nLegco after this month  ' s direct elections . \n\n \n\nThe Legco now has a majority of elected members .\n\n\nIt was virtually left with no job or was effectively preempted in\nthis major project .\n\n\nThe consultative committee is an advisory body appointed by the\nGovernor ( after consulting Beijing ) .\n\n\nBut it has been given a job to monitor a project said to be vital to\nthe future of Hong Kong .\n\n\nThis is at least bizarre , if not absurd . \n\n \n\nAccording to the Basic Law , the Legco , not consultative\ncommittee of any sort , is one of the constitutional pillars in Hong Kong\nafter 1997 .\n\n\nBut the solution to the airport dispute runs contrary to the\nestablishment of this pillar , which would turn to threaten the success of\nrealizing \" Hong Kong People Ruling Hong Kong &rdquo; . \n\n \n\nAll these at least partly stemmed from China  ' s refusal to\nrecognize the Legco  ' s representativeness and legitimacy , which gives rise\nto the need for establishing the kind of replacement setup such as a\nconsultative committee .\n\n\nThis position is justifiable in the past , but not now and onwards .\n \n\n \n\n\nWhy sacrifice the airport for oligarchy ?\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAt the time of this writing , the British and Chinese Governments\nhave yet to resume discussions on the new airport project .\n\n\nThe secrecy of these talks , which is reminiscent of the Sino-British\nnegotiations over Hong Kong  ' s future , makes it difficult to know exactly\nwhat is being considered by both sides , and if either are offering any real\nconcessions . \n\n \n\nHowever , the British and Hong Kong Governments apparently are\ntrying hard to paint a picture wherein they must choose between a new airport\nand the authority to effectively administer the territory in the run up to\n1997 . \n\n \n\nThis impression is being created by occasional comments from\nallegedly \" informed persons &rdquo; , by the British Foreign Secretary\nMr. Douglas Hurd during his visit , and top local Government officials and\nExecutlve Councillors . \n\n \n\nBut are these the only two options ?  \n\n\n The Government  ' s Losing Bet  \n\n \n\nRecently expressed public opinions indicate that the public is\npointing its finger at the Hong Kong Government for messing up the airport\nproject . \n\n \n\nThere is little doubt that one reason for the confusion over the\nairport is that the Hong Kong Government mishandled relations with China on\nthe issue .\n\n\nMore and more opinions are being expressed blaming the Government for\nnot actively and constructively seeking early consultation with the Chinese\nGovernment on the project . \n\n \n\nThe unexpected announcement of building the Lantau Fixed Crossing\nlinking Kowloon and the proposed Chek Lap Kok airport by public funds on the\neve of the Sino-Hong Kong expert group meeting last October dealt a fatal\nblow to smoother cooperations between Hong Kong and China on the new airport .\n\n\n \n\nAgainst such a backdrop .\n\n\nit came as no surprise that an opinion poll commissioned by the South\nChina Morning Post ( SCMP ) published on April 29 shows that\nthe public  ' s rating of Government performance has plunged .\n\n\nIn addition , the poll indicates support for making concessions ,\nalthough unspecified , to the Chinese side . \n\n \n\nThis may indicate that the public is dissatisfied with the way\nthe Hong Kong Government is handling relations with China .\n\n\nIn addition , the public seems to understand well that diplomacy\nrequires a constant give-and-take , diplomacy with China included . \n\n \n\nThese public sentiments do not support the reported position of\nthe Government , which is that there can be no trade-off whatsoever between\n\" effective &rdquo; administration and a replacement airport . \n\n \n\nIt seems that the Government is betting on the possibility that\nHong Kong people would prefer keeping the existing decision-making mechanism\n( which the Government calls \" effective \" administration\n) intact to embracing a new airport which is still on consultants  ' \npaper .\n\n\nBut the SCMP survey indicates that the Government may have lost its\nbet . \n\n \n\nOne may wonder why Hong Kong people do not favour an \"\neffective administration &rdquo; .\n\n\nBut let it not be forgotten that the way the Government handled the\nnew airport project exemplifies those aspects of the colonial decision-making\nprocess which should not be duplicated .\n\n\nNor should we sacrifice the airport project in order to keep this\nform of Government . \n\n \n\nTo date , the public is still kept in the dark on the\ndecision-making process .\n\n\nThe Government cites technicalities as the reason for not disclosing\nmore information .\n\n\nThe Government has kept details to themselves .\n\n\nEven Legislative Councillors complain that they are kept in the dark .\n\n\n \n\nIs such a colonial style oligarchy what the Hong Kong public\nwants ?\n\n\nDoubtful .\n\n\nBut if oligarchy is what the Government wants, the Government should\nnot expect support from the public when it finds itself tackling the airport\ncontroversy on its own . \n\n \n\nWhat Hong Kong people want to see is a more open government at\nhome and a smooth and constructive cooperation between China and Hong Kong on\nmajor matters affecting the transition .\n\n\nThey also want a viable new airport project to carry Hong Kong into\nthe next century .\n\n\nThese two things need not be mutually exclusive .   \n\n\n Effective Administration Means Being Able To Deal With China\n \n\n \n\nTo be effective , the Administration must have the authority to\nmake decisions regarding domestic affairs , and the ability to get things\ndone .\n\n\nTo complete major plans , such as the airport , which straddle 1997\nrequires the Government to both exercise its authority and win the support of\nthe Chinese Government . \n\n \n\nThe Government  ' s reported position of threatening to shelve the\nnew airport project only serves to illustrate the Government  ' s\nshort-sightedness and poor diplomatic behavior when faced with a tough\nnegotiator . \n\n \n\nIt is high time the Government reviewed its China policy and\ndemonstrated an ability to mend fences with the Chinese Government .\n\n\nThis is particularly important now because Hong Kong is already in\nthe second phase of the transition period. The Government is not forced to\nchoose between an effective administration and a new airport .\n\n\nBut it is forcing itself into a corner by refusing to realise that to\nsteer Hong Kong through this transition period , it must change its colonial\nstyle of administering Hong Kong . \n\n \n\nKeeping China at bay and making decisions behind closed doors is\nthe easy way out .\n\n\nMaintaining creative and constructive relations with Beijing , albeit\nmore difficult , requires leadership skills the colonial government does not\nhave at the moment .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "98346f7f-cc1a-49de-85f7-6b220357bba4", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.000969+00:00"}

{"text": "Urban Redevelopment as a Process of Capital Accumulation ?\n\n\n \n\n\nCase of Hong Kong  ' s Land Development Corporation ( LDC\n)  \n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nWithin the context of urban development , urban redevelopment is\nan important and controversial public issue .\n\n\nAs time goes by , some of the earlier buildings in a city become\nstructurally unsound whilst others may be functionally or environmentally\nobsolete .\n\n\nRedevelopment of these building sites thus becomes necessary . \n\n \n\nFollowing Harvey  ' s framework for the analysis of the urban\nprocess under capitalism ( Harvey , 1981 ) , urban\nredevelopment can be interpreted as a process of capital accumulation may act\nupon the urban redevelopment process .\n\n\nTo this end , attention is focused on the recently-established Land\nDevelopment Corporation in Hong Kong . \n\n \n\nThe LDC is a body corporate established by legislation in 1987 to\ntake charge of urban renewal and matters incidental thereto in Hong Kong .\n\n\nOne of the distinctive aims of the Corporation is to channel private\ncapital into public redevelopment projects .\n\n\nIt is argued that the roles and functions of the Corporation will\nultimately be constrained by the inherent nature of its profit-orientation .\n\n\nSince the Corporation has to act on prudent commercial principles\n( Land Development Corporation Ordinance , Section 10 ( 1\n) , it acts , in Harvey  ' s interpretation , as a financial institution\nto facilitate the switch of capital into a built environment ( Harvey\n, 1981:97 ) defined as the totality of physical structure &longdash;\nhouses , roads , factories , offices , sewage systems , parks , cultural\ninstitutions , and education facilities ( Harvey , 1976:265 ) .\n\n\nIn this endeavour it is doubtful that the Corporation can , on the\none hand , serve the private developers &rsquo; interests ( ie. profit\nmaximization in the urban redevelopment project ) and , on the other\nhand , look after the interests of the low-income and elderly residents who\nare displaced ( Lo and Ma , 1986:9 ) .  \n\n\nCAPITAL ACCUMULATION AND SWITCHING OF CAPITAL \n\n \n\nAccording to Marx  ' s analysis of inherent contradictions within\ncapitalism , capitalism will inevitably face crises in the process of capital\naccumulation .\n\n\nThis may happen when competition between individual capitalists ,\neach acting in their own immediate self-interest to achieve the expanded\nreproduction of capital , forces them to lengthen and intensify the work\nprocess so as to exploit workers and increase the rate of surplus value .\n\n\nOne contradiction is the tendency towards overaccumulation &longdash;\ntoo much capital is produced in aggregate relative to the opportunities to\nemploy that capital ( Harvey , 1981:94 ) .\n\n\nThis tendency is manifest in a variety of crises , including\noverproduction of commodities and gluts on the market , falling rates of\nprofit, surplus capital ( which can be manifest either as idle\nproductive capacity or as money-capital lacking opportunities for profitable\nemployment ) and surplus labour and/or rising rates of exploitation of\nlabour power ( Ibid ) .\n\n\nSuch crises , in Harvey  ' s words , are the real manifestation of the\nunderlying contradictions within the capitalist process of accumulation\n( Ibid.:101 ) .\n\n\nAccording to Harvey , these crises can be resolved by the switching\nof capital between circuits .  \n\n\nCircuits of Capital \n\n \n\nAs Harvey points out , capital can operate in three circuits.\nFirst , there is the &lsquo; primary circuit of capital &rsquo; , for which\nhe does not give a succinct definition .\n\n\nNevertheless , we may put the entire process of the appropriation of\nsurplus value by capital under the primary circuit of capital .\n\n\nThe problem of overaccumulation is seen to be endemic in the &lsquo;\nprimary circuit of capital &rsquo; resulting , in King  ' s interpretation , in\noveraccumulation in industrial production ( King, 1989a:446 ) .\n\n\nIn order to resolve this crisis , capital should switch from the\n&lsquo; primary circuit &rsquo; .\n\n\nThe secondary circuit of capital involves the flow of capital into\nfixed capital .\n\n\nSimply stated , fixed capital means fixed assets or capital assets\nused to aid production , such as factories and office buildings. Here it is\nimportant to distinguish between fixed capital engaged in the production\nprocess and that which functions as a physical framework for production .\n\n\nThis latter Harvey calls the &lsquo; built environment for production\n&rsquo; ( Harvey, 1981:96 ) . \n\n \n\nOn the consumption side , there is a parallel structure , but\nfixed capital in the secondary circuit is called the  ' consumption fund\n&rsquo; .\n\n\nIt is formed out of commodities which function as aids rather than as\ndirect inputs to consumption. Some items are directly enclosed within the\nconsumption process ( consumer durables such as cookers or washing\nmachines ) while others act as a physical framework for consumption ,\nsuch as housing or sidewalks .\n\n\nThese latter Harvey calls the  &lsquo; built environment for\nconsumption  '   ( Ibid. ) .\n\n\nFurthermore , there are some items in the built environment , for\ninstance , the transport network , that serve both production and consumption .\n\n\n \n\nFinally , there is the &lsquo; tertiary circuit of capital\n&rsquo; which consists of investment in science and technology , and social\nexpenditures which are designed to improve the future productivity or quality\nof labour power .  \n\n\nUnderinvestment Problem in Built Environment and the Need of &lsquo;\nFictional Capital &rsquo; \n\n \n\nCrises within these various circuits of capital can be resolved\nby the switching of capital between them, particularly in the case of\nover-accumulation in the primary circuit .\n\n\nIt should be noted , however , that for a variety of reasons\nindividual capitalists will often find it difficult to bring about such\nswitch in capital flows .\n\n\nThis is particularly so with regard to the switch of capital into the\nbuilt environment where  \" ... investments tend to be\nlarge-scale and long-lasting , often difficult to price in the ordinary way\nand in many cases open to collective use by all individual capitalists\n&rdquo;  ( Ibid.:97 ) .\n\n\nIn consequence , there will be tendency towards over accumulation in\nthe &lsquo; primary circuit ' and underinvestment in the &lsquo; secondary\ncircuit &rsquo; . \n\n \n\nTo resolve this there needs to be a money supply and credit\nsystem which creates &lsquo; fictional capital &rsquo; in advance of\nproduction and consumption in both the consumption fund ( for example\n, housing mortgages , consumer credit , and municipal debt ) and fixed\ncapital .\n\n\nIn this endeavour, financial and state institutions act as \n\" ... a kind of collective nerve centre governing and mediating the\nrelations between the primary and secondary circuits of capital &rdquo;\n and the policies that they adopt can play  \" ... an\nimportant role in checking or enhancing flows of capital into the secondary\ncircuit of capital or into certain specific aspects of it &rdquo; \n( Ibid. ) . \n\n \n\nDepending upon the efficiency of the mediating institutions , the\nswitch into the secondary circuit may be achieved relatively smoothly or it\nmay be undertaken in the course of a crisis .\n\n\nCrises can be of three kinds : &lsquo; partial &rsquo; crises\n( affecting a particular sector , region , or set of mediating\ninstitutions , and usually resolved within that sector ) , &lsquo;\nswitching &rsquo; crises ( involving a major reorganization and\nrestructuring of capital flows and/or mediating institutions to open up new\nchannels for investment , with these flows of capital dividing sectorally and\ngeographically ) , and &lsquo; global &rsquo; crises (\naffecting , to some extent , all sectors , spheres and regions within the\ncapitalist production system ) ( Ibid.:102 ) .  \n\n\nSome Empirical Analyses of Switching of Capital \n\n \n\nHarvey has provided an empirical analysis of long waves of\ncapital accumulation and contraction in the world economy. Though his\nempirical findings are very generalized , they are illuminating ( King\n, 1989a:447 ) .\n\n\nFor example , the cycles of boom and bust in built environment\ninvestment in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries are given as\nevidence of cycles of accumulation and consequent switching between economic\nsectors .\n\n\nThe &lsquo; Atlantic economy &rsquo; of the same period provides\nevidence of geographical switching , whilst the pre-1973 property boom in\nBritain and the USA is seen to be indicative of the coming of the &lsquo;\nsecond global crisis &rsquo; ( Ibid. ) . \n\n \n\nIn the course of the &lsquo; second global crisis &rsquo; private\nnet direct investment flows into Asia were substantial\n\n\n( see Table 1 ) .\n\n\nSince part of the sectoral and/or geographical switching crises of\nthe developed countries was resolved by a geographical shift in investment to\nthe developing countries , there is a substantial growth in the fluidity and\navailability of capital in some of the market economies of Asia .\n\n\nAnd these flows have been greatly facilitated by the growth and\ndevelopment of a wide variety of financial institutions . \n\n \n\nMoreover , the switching crises launched the investment wave in\nthe built environment of consumption .\n\n\nDuring the 19705 , virtually every major Asian city experienced a\nvery rapid growth of office and hotel buildings as a result of \n\" ... generous loans from the banking system and a combination of both\nnational and regional capital &rdquo;  ( Armstrong and McGee ,\n1985:103 ) .\n\n\nFor instance , domestic bank loans for building and construction in\nHong Kong rose from 10 per cent of total domestic bank loans in 1978 to 28\nper cent by the end of 1982\n\n\n( see Table 2 ) .   \n\n\nOveraccumulation in Built Environment \n\n \n\nIt is noted that switching solutions very often quickly lead to\noveraccumulation in the built environment ( ie. to an oversupply of\nresidential , office , commercial and industrial buildings ) .\n\n\nThis over accumulation is likely to be fueled by speculation .\n\n\nThe boom and bust of the Australian property market in the second\nhalf of the 1980s is a good example of this .\n\n\nMassive volumes of capital , local and foreign , poured into the\nconstruction and re-construction of certain elements of the Australian\ncapital cities and coastal regions .\n\n\nThese capital cities competed with each other for the position as\ncentres of consumption ( as casinos , elite residential/recreational\nenclaves , expos and retailing complexes ) and as centres for\ndischarging command and control functions ( the headquarters or\nregional head offices of national and global corporations in the industrial,\ncommercial and financial spheres through the provision of &lsquo; intelligent\n&rsquo; buildings , communications infrastructure, appropriately skilled and\ndisciplined labour power and a suitably &lsquo; cosmopolitan &rsquo;\nlifestyle ) ( Harvey , 1987:260-286 &semi; Berry and Huxley ,\n1988:6 ) .\n\n\nAs a result , the high volume and increasingly speculative nature of\ninvestment has led to overaccumulation , especially in the office sector .\n\n\nThis has coincided with rapidly rising rates of space absorption or\ntake-up , rising rents ( especially prime rents in the CBDs )\nand falling vacancy rates .\n\n\nProperty values have risen even faster than rents , resulting in\nfalling yields .\n\n\nThis indicates significant speculative pressures at work (\nHuxley and Berry , 1989:91 ) . \n\n \n\nMoreover , the State and Territory governments also entered the\nproperty market to facilitate the switch of capital into the built\nenvironment .\n\n\nThe state government involvement was exemplified in the so-called\n&lsquo; mega-projects &rsquo; .\n\n\nThese &lsquo; mega-projects &rsquo; have sought to integrate luxury\nresidential , tourist , retailing and leisure uses , targetted towards\nwealthy Australian and foreign consumers ( Berry , 1990:6 ) .\n\n\nThe intervention is often facilitated , through the sale of crown\nland and/or subsidized infrastructure provision , special enabling\nlegislation , fast-track &rsquo; planning approval , and financial\npartnership arrangements ( Berry , 1988:9-10 ) .\n\n\nHowever, the direct involvement of the state governments in property\ndevelopments further intensified the speculative forces for development in a\nsituation increasingly facing substantial oversupply and hastened the\nspeculative bust in the late 1980s . \n\n \n\nSince the resultant built environment is relatively long-lasting\n, it may become a barrier to further investment .\n\n\nEventually it must be devalued to open up fresh opportunities for\ncapitalist investment .\n\n\nIn the meantime, continuous profitable investment in the built\nenvironment can be made possible by a structure of differentiated submarkets .\n\n\nSome housing submarkets are manipulated by public and private\nfinancial institutions as the targets for new investment while some are\nsubject to neglect and devaluation ( of exchange values , but use\nvalues remain relatively intact ) only to become , in time , targets\nfor further cycles of investment ( Harvey , 1974:239-255 ) .\n\n\nFor example, Harvey identifies no less than thirteen submarkets in\nBaltimore , each characterized by different income and house-price levels ,\ndifferent forms of tenure , different social and ethnic patterns and the\ninvolvement of different combinations of financial institutions with their\ndifferent lending and financing rules ( Harvey , 1977 &semi; Bassett\nand Short , 1980 : Part 3 )  .\n\n\nDevaluation is thus place-specific, resulting in &lsquo; uneven\n&rsquo; urban development over space and time .\n\n\nAccordingly , relationships can be established between the\ndevelopment of the built environment and the rhythms of accumulation (\nSmith , 1984:126 ) .  \n\n\nWEAKNESSES OF &lsquo; CIRCUIT OF CAPITAL &rsquo; ARGUMENT \n\n \n\nUnfortunately , what cannot be predicted is the timing of a\nswitch into or out of the secondary circuit .\n\n\nRather , we can only identify some conditions and means which will\nallow the switch to take place .\n\n\nIn the light of ground rent theory ( which identifies\ndifferential , absolute and monopoly rent ( Bassett and Short ,\n1980:193-194 &semi; King , 1989a:448-450 ) ) , King identifies\nfour market conditions in which high or low interest rates , relative to\nprofits from the construction of housing , can influence the incentives to\nswitch investment into and out of the housing markets\n\n\n( see Table 3 )\n\n\n( King, 1989b:712 ) .\n\n\nHis case study of Melbourne  ' s housing market gives general support\nto Harvey  ' s &lsquo; circuits of capital &rsquo; argument , at least since\n1932 .\n\n\nAccording to King,   booms and slumps in housing\nproduction , as well as the flow of speculative money capital into and out of\nhousing , can indeed be related to crises of overaccumulation arising\nelsewhere in the economy ...\n\n\n The relationship is not , however, direct   \n( King , 1989b:735 ) .\n\n\nMoreover , Harvey  ' s model needs to accommodate the forms of crises\napparently emerging in contemporary society .\n\n\nEconomic crises are increasingly transposed into the political system\n, to emerge as rationalization crises ( whereby the state is unable to\ndeliver the requisite rational, administrative decisions to resolve the\ncrisis ) or as legitimation crises ( whereby public\nexpectations of state activity outstrip its ability to ensure the legitimacy\nof the status quo ) .\n\n\nUltimately , the crisis tendencies can be further transposed into the\ncultural system .\n\n\nWhen the traditional bases of motivation ( such as\nself-achievement and material success ) are undermined by the\nseemingly endemic nature of economic crises , underemployment , and loss of\nfaith in modernist progress , there can be a &lsquo; motivation deficit\n&rsquo; , resulting in a motivation crisis ( Habermas , 1976 &semi;\nKing, 1989c:854 ) .  \n\n\nSocial Relations of Built Environment \n\n \n\nIn addition , when looking at the role of the built environment\nunder capitalism , Harvey has also to incorporate the social agents that are\ninvolved ( Ball, 1986:451 ) .\n\n\nHarvey argues that accumulation cannot be isolated from the class\nstruggle because the capitalist class has to find the means to exploit labour .\n\n\nHarvey extends this perspective to argue that the organization of the\nworking class , and its capacity to mount an overt class response , can\naffect the urban process under capitalism .\n\n\nHence he concludes that \" the surface appearance of conflicts\naround the built environment &longdash; the struggle against the landlord or\nagainst the urban renewal &longdash; conceals a hidden essence that is\nnothing more than the struggle between capital and labour &rdquo; (\nHarvey , 1976:289 ) .\n\n\nIn other words ,  \" whatever is happening in the built\nenvironment it will eventually be resolved to the benefits of the\nundifferentiated interests of capital in general , even if that resolution\ngenerates further problems that have to be resolved in turn &rdquo; \n( Ball , 1986:452 ) . \n\n \n\nDespite this , Harvey  ' s conceptualization of the role of the\nbuilt environment under capitalism does not clearly define the linkages\nbetween capital-labour class struggle and the built environment and largely\nneglects the social agents involved in the built environment .\n\n\nAlthough capital investment in urban redevelopment is for the sake of\naccumulation , the social agents involved in the redevelopment process can\nact upon the structure of building provision .\n\n\nAs Ball argues,   creating and using built structures\ninvolves particular sets of social agents defined by their economic relation\nto the physical process of provision itself . \n\n\nEach historically specific set of social agents can be defined as a\nstructure of building provision .\n\n\nBy provision is meant the production , exchange, distribution , and\nuse of a built structure    ( Ibid.:455 ) .\n\n \n\nWithin the context of urban redevelopment , therefore , a set of\nsocial agents may include landlords , private developers, financial\ninstitutions , government , and final users .\n\n\nEach social agent will have an economic tie with the urban\nredevelopment process and the subsequent benefits of the new physical\nlandscape .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "08f90337-e8a5-4473-b88f-012277daee14", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.003131+00:00"}

{"text": "Dear Mr. O'Hara , \n\n\n RE : URBTIX TICKETING SYSTEM TO THE HONG KONG ARTS CENTRE \n\n\n \n\nThe agreement between the Urban Services Department ( USD\n) and the Hong Kong Arts Centre ( HKAC ) for the\nprovision of the Urbtix ticketing system to the HKAC is due to expire by the\nend of June 1994 . \n\n \n\nThe subject of renewal of the said agreement was discussed in the\n37th meeting of the Board of Governors of the HKAC held on 6th June 1994 .\n\n\nAs most of the HKAC project funds reply on sponsorship , sponsor for\nfree ticketing system to the HKAC as a project was suggested .\n\n\nIt was resolved that the Urban Council ( UC ) should be\napproached for this purpose as the UC has already been subsidizing the HKAC\nin using the said ticketing system , the Board believes that an extension of\nthis subsidy should be acceptable to the UC as this would allow more funds to\nbe available to the HKAC in presenting more/better programmes . \n\n \n\nYour name was given by Mr. Paul Young , representative of the UC\nin the HKAC Board of Governors for addressing the issue to the UC . \n\n \n\nBased on the existing agreement for 1993/94 , the following table\nprepared by the USD quantifies the contribution by both parties under the\nexisting arrangement . \n\n\n\n\n \n\nIn view of the above , assuming the number of tickets to be sold\nfor HKAC events by other Urbtix outlets remains unchanged , and based on the\nproposed new rate from the USD @&dollar;3. per ticket , the total ticket\ncharge payable to the UC should become &dollar;131,694 .\n\n\nAdding in the monthly fixed charges for the equipment , the total\nsponsorship that HKAC is looking from the UC for 1994/95 is estimated to be\naround &dollar;320,000 .\n\n\nAs there is a tendency that the number of tickets for HKAC events to\nbe sold in other Urbtix outlets is dropping , the increase of the UC\nsponsorship per year to be HKAC should remain quite constant in the years to\ncome . \n\n \n\nTo furnish you with some background information , the Urbtix\nticketing system was introduced into the HKAC in October 1987 .\n\n\nThe basic concept for the said introduction was to benefit the HKAC\nthe service of a sophisticated ticketing system which the HKAC could not\nafford if it is to stand on its own .\n\n\nIn return , the HKAC would use its own staff resources to operate the\nHKAC outlet as one of the Urbtix outlets and to assist in selling ticket\ninventories for non-HKAC events .\n\n\nCharge would only impose on tickets sold for the HKAC events in other\nUrbtix outlets together with the leasing of the basic equipments . \n\n \n\nTerms and conditions of the said agreement were modified upon\neach renewal in every two years .\n\n\nHowever , circumstances have been changed since the introduction of\nthe said system as the UC and Regional Council ( RC ) venues\nfor performances have been increased considerably .\n\n\nTotal number of seats in performing venues available for booking\nunder the Urbtix System ranges from about 7,500 , 82,000 , 2,700 to 712 for\nRC , UC , Academy of Performing Arts and HKAC respectively .\n\n\nFrom these figures , one can visualize that the HKAC has to face\ntremendous competition in the availability of cultural venues .\n\n\nTo survive needs reviewing of all revenues and expenses . \n\n \n\nTotal number of tickets sold for the HKAC events amounts to\n124,836 in 93/94 of which 80,938 ( 65% ) were sold in\nthe HKAC and 43,898 ( 35% ) were sold in Urbtix outlets\nwhich under the present arrangement would incur a charge to the HKAC . \n\n \n\nTotal number of tickets sold in the HKAC in 93/94 amounts to\n171,486 of which 90,548 ( 53% ) tickets were for\nnon-HKAC events .\n\n\nGrowth rate for tickets of non-HKAC event goes as high as 60%\nbetween 92/93 to 93/94 .\n\n\nThis implies that additional man power and thus costs are required ,\nespecially taking into consideration the fact that special arrangements have\nto be made in selling tickets for pop concerts organized in the UC venues .\n\n\n \n\nUnlike the Academy of Performing Arts and the RC , the HKAC has\nto reply on its own resources .\n\n\nMany times worthwhile programme were cancelled simply because of lack\nof funds .\n\n\nIn view of this , the HKAC Board of Governors wishes to urge the UC\nto seriously consider granting a free Urbtix ticketing system to the HKAC so\nas to enable the HKAC to further develop the objectives as set in the\nGovernment  ' s Hong Kong Arts Centre Ordinance . \n\n \n\nShould you have any queries or require further information with\nregard to the above , please give the undersigned a ring at 5820224 .\n\n\nAs the present agreement is due to expiring on 30/6/94 , your urgent\nattention and reply will be much appreciated . \n\n\nYours Sincerely ,\n\n\nHONG KONG ARTS CENTRE\n\n\n\n\n\nJackie Ma\n\n\nChief Executive\n\n\ncc :\n\n\nMr. Paul Young , Member of Board of Governors HKAC\n\n\nMr. Po Chung , Chairman of Board of Governors HKAC\n\n\n\n\nDear Margaret ,\n\n \n\nThis refers to your letter of 27th June 1994 and our subsequent\nmeeting .\n\n\nI wish to congratulate you on your success in getting the Council  ' s\ncontinuous support to ARIC but regret to hear that you will be leaving soon .\n\n\nAfter seeing what you have been able to achieve , your departure will\ndefinitely be a loss to ARIC . \n\n \n\nRight from the conception stage , the Hong Kong Arts Centre has\nbeen closely linked with ARIC .\n\n\nWe appreciate very much that ARIC , like ourselves , is a non-profit\nmaking organization to provide services to the arts community of Hong Kong .\n\n\nThat explains why the Hong Kong Arts Centre has always been a keen\nsupporter to ARIC . \n\n \n\nAs you may well aware , the Hong Kong Arts Centre revenue relies\nheavily on the hiring charges of the various performing/exhibition venues and\nrental income from the office block .\n\n\nDue to inadequacy of capital funds available for our building\nmaintenance , we are trying hard to maximize our revenue in all directions\nand income from rental and venue hiring definitely has rooms for improvement .\n\n\nThe Customer Services Department who handles bookings , briefings ,\nand complaints from our hirers of venues and the public needs an office which\nis closer to the venues and the public in order to cater for the anticipated\nincrease of workload .\n\n\nThis is the rational behind the requested relocation as discussed in\nour previous meeting . \n\n \n\nInstead of exercising the planned relocation , to extend ARIC  ' s\ntenancy on 1 April 1994 for six months at the present location and at a\nreduced market rental has already been a reduced market rental has already\nbeen a concession upon your request . \n\n \n\nTo enable ARIC to have more time to plan for its budget for\nrelocation , as a gesture of goodwill to support the arts community , the\nHong Kong Arts Centre once again agrees to extend ARIC  ' s existing tenancy at\nsimilar terms for another six months up to 31st March 1995 . \n\n \n\nWe hope you would appreciate that the above concessions are to a\ncertain extend at the expense of the Hong Kong Arts Centre which has to\nsurvive on its own resources .\n\n\nWe do wish that you will convey this message to your successor , so\nthat he or she will include the said relocation in his/her planning . \n\n \n\nLast but not least , I wish to thank you for a very enlightening\nand enjoyable evening meeting and please do keep in touch . \n\n \n\nWishing you all the best in your new appointment . \n\n\nRegards\n\n\n\n\n\nJackie Ma\n\n\nChief Executive\n\n\nbcc :\n\n\nSimon/Pamela - to note the extension\n\n\n\n\nDear Sirs , \n\n\n RE : WANG SI CHIU , DECEASED  \n\n \n\nThis refers to your letter of 4th August 1994 . \n\n \n\nAll along Vivien Chan &ampersand; Co and especially Ms .\n\n\nVivien Chan had supported the Hong Kong Arts Centre tremendously\nespecially in terms of legal advice and committee works .\n\n\nTo this , on behalf of the Board and the various Committees of the\nHong Kong Arts Centre , we wish to extend our heartful thanks . \n\n \n\nWe appreciate very much your kind gesture as to practically\ndonate your service rendered so far in respect of the captioned case by\ncharging us a nominal fee of approximately 10% of the actual staff\ncosts incurred .\n\n\nHowever , we regret to hear that you are no longer interested to\nrepresent us further in this case after all your hard work in the last 4\nyears . \n\n \n\nAs you must be aware that the Hong Kong Arts Centre is a\nnon-profit making public organization relying on very limited funds to\npromote and develop arts for the people of Hong Kong .\n\n\nAn unexpected donation of a property from Mr. Wang Si Chiu will\ndefinitely be an asset to the Hong Kong Arts Centre as the revenue generated\nfrom the property can be a good project funding after covering all expenses\nconcerned .\n\n\nHowever , to incur huge legal costs in appointing another legal\nadvisor to further pursue the issue which to my present understanding is a\ndoubtful case is beyond what the Hong Kong Arts Centre can afford . \n\n \n\nAs your company has been representing us in this case for such a\nlong time and based on our long term relationship , we sincerely hope that\nyou can continue the service .\n\n\nHowever , if you really have to insist on your decision , we wish\nthat you could do us a favour by informing the Probate Registry that there\nare difficulties in locating the deceased  ' s wife and that the Arts Centre\nwould like to request the Probate Registry to use its discretion to decide if\nthe Arts Centre can get its representation or not . \n\n \n\nIf a negative reply is received from the Probate Registry , the\nBoard may consider the case closed . \n\n \n\nYour company has our sincere gratitude for all the services and\nsupport rendered in the past years and your bill of &dollar;8,704.- will be\nsettled in due course . \n\n \n\nOnce again , many thanks and we look forward to hearing from you

apologise for the delay of this reply as I have been away\nfrom Hong Kong till 9 August 1994 . \n\n \n\nI believe Ms. Gipsy Ng our Membership Manager has cleared with\nyou the confusion of your name  ' s issue . \n\n \n\nAs regard to the introductory card for HKAC members to the Art\nclub in London , I am afraid that this benefit to members had been suspended\nsometime in the past .\n\n\nI believe the suspension must be due to the indifference of members\nto this benefit . \n\n \n\nHowever if an introductory letter from us can serve the purpose ,\nwe are more than glad to do you this service .\n\n\nAttached please find a copy of our introductory letter . \n\n \n\nWishing you a pleasant journey . \n\n\nYours Sincerely ,\n\n\nHONG KONG ART CENTRE\n\n\n\n\n\nJackie Ma\n\n\nChief Executive\n\n\nEnc.\n\n\n\n\nDear Sir Hotung ,\n\n \n\nIn our recent applications of project and matching grants to the\nHong Kong Arts Development council ( HKADC ) for the funding of\ntwo performing arts projects of the Hong Kong Arts Centre ( HKAC\n) , only 37.5% and 62.5% of the applied funding were\ngranted . \n\n \n\nWe fully realize that the newly established HKADC would have a\nnew set of criteria for the assessment of funding of projects .\n\n\nIn order to get the full support of the HKADC in HKAC  ' s application\nespecially for programmes/projects which cannot be self supporting through\nbox office income or commercial sponsorship , we consider it vital to bring\nto the attention of the Council members the present business and financial\nposition of the HKAC . \n\n \n\nThe HKAC is the largest independent non-profit making arts\norganization in Hong Kong , the objectives of which is governed by Government  ' s\nHong Kong Arts Centre Ordinance to develop arts in all forms and it is\nrecognised in the mission statement of the HKADC . \n\n \n\nDue to the proliferation of art venues built by the Municipal\nCouncils , the HKAC no longer enjoys the unique status it had a decade ago .\n\n\nTo continue to play an important role in the arts , the HKAC has\nidentified that more emphasis should be put in supporting non-established\nartistic endeavours and innovative projects and out reach programme . \n\n \n\nThe HKAC , through its own presentation or venue hiring , offers\na variety of art programmes/activities to the people of Hong Kong practically\nin everyday of a year .\n\n\nTo maintain the above operation , the HKAC needs a budget of 37\nmillion in the 94/95 financial year .\n\n\nThis budget is funded by income from rental , box office , venue\nhiring , advertising , sponsorship and donation . \n\n \n\nIn general , rental income from offices of art organizations or\ncommercial companies occupying half of the HKAC building supports salaries of\nthe HKAC staff and the routine maintenance costs of the 128,000 square foot\nbuilding .\n\n\nThe box office income together with commercial sponsorship cover the\nprogramme  ' s production costs and their required publicity .\n\n\nVenue hiring charges cover the general administration and operation\ncosts .\n\n\nThe surplus is to offset the capital maintenance expenditure of the\nbuilding . \n\n \n\nThe above arrangement enables the HKAC to operate on a self\nfinancing situation without relying on any government subsidy in the past few\nyears .\n\n\nHowever due to factors listed below , the HKAC is compelled to look\nfor other alternatives in order to maintain its standard of operation and\npresentation without changing its original objectives . \n\n \n\n1.\n\n\nTo upkeep this 17 year old building , a budget of 25 million is\nrequired for capital expenditure in the coming five years . \n\n \n\n2.\n\n\nDue to economic recession back in home town or shifting of corporate\nbase to China , quite a number of HKAC  ' s usual commercial sponsors have\nwithdrawn their sponsorship to the HKAC programmes . \n\n \n\n3.\n\n\nTo secure new commercial sponsors is very competitive as there are\nplenty of applications for sponsorship from the Art Festivals , Art Clubs and\nMunicipal Council  ' s grand performances . \n\n \n\n4.\n\n\nThe HKAC  ' s repositioning by putting more emphasis in supporting\nnon-established artistic endeavours makes it more difficult for the HKAC to\nsecure commercial sponsors . \n\n \n\n5.\n\n\nOver 50% of HKAC  ' s funding comes from rental of the office\nareas .\n\n\nThe property market  ' s downturn will put HKAC in a financial\ndifficult position . \n\n \n\nThe above indicates that the HKAC needs a big reserve for the\nupkeep of the building and for contingencies .\n\n\nIn the long run , the rental income which fluctuates with the\nproperty market may not be able to cover the inflation of the staff salaries .\n\n\nIt is especially so when the panoramic seaview of the offices is\nblocked by high rises built in the new Wanchai seafront reclamation in the\nimminent future . \n\n \n\nConsolidation of expenses and maximization of revenue have been\nexercised in all directions .\n\n\nTo avoid many worthwhile projects/programmes being curtailed due to\nlack of sponsors/funding , resolution had been obtained from the Board of\nGovernors of the HKAC to apply for project funding from the newly established\nHKADC . \n\n \n\nIn general , non-profit making Arts Centre around the world\ncannot survive on its own but have to rely on subsidy and grants .\n\n\nTo maintain the objectives as laid down by the Government as an art\npromoter , presenter and developer , the HKAC do need the full support of the\nHKADC .\n\n\nThe curtail of venue costs from the budget of the HKAC programme\napplication because the HKAC owns the venue can , as explained in the above ,\nput the financial position of the HKAC off the balance . \n\n \n\nI hope the above has given the council and Committee members of\nthe HKADC a better understanding of the HKAC , accepting that it is unique\nand different from the operation of other art bodies in Hong Kong and\nsubsequently special consideration should be given in the assessment of the\nHKAC applications .\n\n\nIf further elaboration of the above is required , I am ready to\nattend any meeting so that I can explain in full . \n\n \n\nThank you for your attention to the above . \n\n\nYours Sincerely ,\n\n\nHONG KONG ARTS CENTRE\n\n\n\n\n\nJackie Ma\n\n\nChief Executive\n\n\ncc :\n\n\nMs. Katherine

{"text": "HEDGING AGAINST A BELLICOSE CHAMBER \n\n \n\nThe public will witness a new order in the Legislative Council\nafter September's elections .\n\n\nThe legacy of colonialism , which has enabled the administration to\nexert unrestricted control over its legislative body , is becoming Hong\nKong's history . \n\n \n\nThe council will no longer be dominated by appointees , who have\nbeen for years toeing official lines .\n\n\nInstead , the forthcoming elections will simply create a large\nmajority of elected members in the Legco , To be returned in different\nconstituencies , the elected members will overwhelm their counterparts .\n\n\nUnderpinned by massive ballots , the directly elected members may\nexploit their representativeness to the limit . \n\n \n\nA demagogue-ridden chamber is emerging .\n\n\nIt is anticipated that the legislative councillors will be\nuncompromising and deviating from government lines . \n\n \n\nIt is will known that bridging the gap between the administration\nand the law-making body has been the job of unofficial members of the\nExecutive and Legislative Councils .\n\n\nThey are in turn supported by other appointed members in the Legco .\n\n\nBut the institution of a democratically constituted chamber , though\nsubject to qualification , ruins that practice . \n\n \n\nIn strictly legal sense , the Governor is empowered to dissolve\nthe chamber of blatantly veto bills already approved by it , if he finds the\nsituation beyond control .\n\n\nThis may perhaps help reassert government authority .\n\n\nThis measure may also compel members to take to compromises in order\nto avoid another election .\n\n\nBe that as it may , the question then lies in whether the\nadministration could survive the subsequent constitutional crisis . \n\n \n\nCould the administration continue to gain enough support from\nlegislators to pass its bills ? \n\n \n\nThe Government's idea of reviewing again rules governing the\nproceeding of the Legislative Council , though having been keenly discussed\nover the past couple of months , could not be seen as a measure to rule out\nthe possibility of a stalemate . \n\n \n\nThe choices at hand are limited , particularly when there will be\nno structural reform in the political system in the years ahead .\n\n\nA practical consideration is , therefore , to figure out the best\npossible alternative under the existing arrangement . \n\n \n\nThe first alternative is to have the legislators in close contact\nwith the administration at an early stage of policy formulation .\n\n\nThere is a need to establish a formal link between the advisory\ncommittees , which are responsible for key policy issues , and the\nLegislative Council and make the former directly accountable to the latter .\n\n\nThese committees , to be mainly composed of legislators and\nhighest-ranking officials , will be monitored by the Legislative Council .\n\n\n \n\nAnother alternative is that the administration appeals directly\nto the public by making it possible for the community to exercise its\ndiscretion on contentious matters .\n\n\nWhen government bills are held back in the Legislative Council , the\nadministration may mobilise the support it needs from the public .\n\n\nThis may help it get over the hurdles posed by the elected members .\n \n\n \n\n\nGO GREEN OR BE SORRY \n\n \n\nIf Hong Kong does not keep pace with the green movement emerging\nin industrialised nations , trade performance here could decline should\ncountries choose to use environmental issues to spark trade wars . \n\n \n\nIndustrialised countries are embarking upon their own legislative\ninitiatives to require manufacturing industries to take into account product\nwaste when they develop and introduce a product as a commercial item .\n\n\nThis is one of several actions symbolizing the control which\nenvironmental concerns are having on trade agenda . \n\n \n\nIn 1989 Hong Kong was obliged to pass a law to ban the import and\nmanufacturing of chlorofluorocarbons , chemicals which deteriorate the ozone\nlayer , shortly after the Montreal Agreement signed by most OECD countries .\n\n\n \n\nThe Hong Kong Government's anti-pollution policy to date\nstipulates a maximum level of pollutants .\n\n\nThis policy is underpinned by anti-air , water , noise and waste\npollution ordinances . \n\n \n\nBut compliance is costly .\n\n\nThe Government set out a plan , published in the 1989 White Paper\nentitled \"Pollution in HongKong -; Time to Act &rsquo; , to build\ntreatment facilities and help enforce anti-pollution laws .\n\n\nIn this paper , the Government committed &dollar;20billion (\nat 1988 prices ) to the cause .\n\n\nUnfortunately , this White Paper was not preceded by a green paper ,\nwhich usually includes consultation from the public . \n\n \n\nWith more regulatory measures underway to execute the four\nanti-pollution ordinances , until the Government can illustrate that\nanti-pollution policies to date are effective , it will be difficult to\nmuster the public and industrial support needed to enforce them . \n\n \n\nThe Government has not taken the lead to provide the information\nand financial support needed for industries , in the immediate future , to\nadopt a more environment-friendly way of doing business .\n\n\nIf this means that the private sector has to foot more bills , this\nmay not be well received because the Government has not yet made it clear\njust what additional these costs will amount to .\n\n\nAnd , furthermore , because of the declining productivity in the\nmanufacturing sector , companies may not be able to afford to do so . \n\n \n\nOver 95% of the local manufacturing companies are either\nsmall or medium in size who encounter more difficulties in meeting the space\nand cost requirements of environmental regulations than their counterparts in\nother industrialized countries . \n\n \n\nThe Government's reluctance to address in a comprehensive manner\nthe private sector's role in upholding environmental standards is highlighted\nby the fact that the Industry Department , not the Environmental Protection\nDepartment which is responsible for environmental issues , is commissioning\nthe first major study to determine the impact of the Government's current\nenvironmental policies on manufacturing industries . \n\n \n\nUntil the Hong Kong Government is able to integrate its\nanti-pollution laws into a comprehensive policy which incorporates an\nassessment of how complying with anti-pollution laws affects industries ,\nHong Kong's competitiveness could be in jeopardy . \n\n \n\nThe Government will have to deviate from its present policy of\npositive non-interventionism in order to address these environmental\nconcerns .\n\n\nSuch a change would be welcome because Hong Kong must be able to\nrespond to the environmental appeal of the international community without\nlosing its competitive edge .  \n\n \n\n\nBiotechnology : The Emerging Paradigm \n\n \n\nIn order to improve Hong Kong's competitiveness , two questions\nmust be answered : first , should Hong Kong build up its own R &ampersand; D\ncapability in biotechnology; and second , if yes , should priority be given\nto basic research or commercialisation . \n\n \n\nBiotechnology is commonly perceived to be the application of\nscientific and engineering principles to the processing of materials by\nbiological agents to provide goods and services . \n\n \n\nIts rapid growth in the last fifteen years or so , particularly\nin the areas of genetic engineering , tissue culture , cell and enzyme\nimmobilisation , has brought about trade and employment opportunities .\n\n\nThe combined sales volumes of two products of bulk fermentation , for\ninstances , lysine and MSG ( monosodium glutamate ) , now\namount to billions of US dollars annually . \n\n \n\nUnlike the auto and aircraft industries , biotechnology will not\nbe offering more or less the same product categories in a low-growing market .\n\n\nIt serves , rather , to facilitate product development and\nmodification , reduce trade tension , and lower production cost through\nprocess rationalisation .\n\n\nThe OECD has predicted in a recent study that the contribution of\nbiotechnology to GDP will become significant twenty years from now . \n\n \n\nWith applications in the pharmaceutical industry , agriculture ,\nfood/feed processing , chemical and environmental industries , among others ,\nbiotechnology has been thought of as the next technological paradigm ,\nsubsequent to the computer-based paradigm .\n\n\nThat is , it will constitute a body of common-sense knowledge shared\nby the next generation of engineers , managers , and consumers alike . \n\n \n\nThreats , however , lie alongside opportunities .\n\n\nThe better the developed countries have equipped themselves with\nadvanced technologies , the smaller the portion of global trade the Less\nDeveloped Countries and Newly Industrialising Economies will be able to\nretain .\n\n\nAlso , the practice of purchasing technologies in the open market\nrather than building up one's own R &ampersand; D capability will lead to a\nstructural dependency on technology-exporting countries . \n\n \n\nHong Kong is believed to be well poised to capitalise on this\nupcoming technological revolution for the following reasons:\n\n\n&bullet; Hong Kong has a ready supply of brainpower required for\nhigh-technology research;\n\n\n&bullet; the availability of technology-related information in Hong\nKong has provided a basis for Chinese and Hong Kong research units to pool\ntheir manpower resources;\n\n\n&bullet; Hong Kong has developed the necessary management and\nmarketing skills for the launching of new products in the global market; and\n\n\n&bullet; the large number of entrepreneurial baby-boomers in Hong\nKong will be able to provide low and middle technological support to\nhigh-technology endeavours . \n\n \n\nIn fact , biotechnology has been identified by the Technology\nRoad Maps , a group of Hong Kong top-ranking scientists and technologists ,\nto be one of four industrial R &ampersand; D areas that should be given\npriority . \n\n \n\nFurthermore , it has been contended that firstly Hong Kong is\nalready lagging behind in the biotechnological race and secondly it would\ntake an exceedingly long period of time , up to twelve years in the case of a\ngeneric drug prototype , just to complete the product development phase .\n\n\nHong Kong simply cannot afford to wait for serendipitous discoveries\nto start the production process . \n\n \n\nResearch works geared to commercial purposes , on the other hand\n, will generate badly needed capital to be ploughed back into both basic and\napplied research projects .\n\n\nThis way , a critical mass can probably be reached within a shorter\nperiod of time and without substantial government funding . \n\n \n\nA case in point is the recently announced joint venture between\nthe Hong Kong Institute of Biotechnology and the American pharmaceutical\nmanufacturer Syntex .\n\n\nThe capital outlay amounts to millions of Hong Kong dollars but hard\ncash comes mainly from the US side , whereas the Institute provides\nmanagerial and sourcing services .\n\n\nThe probability of arriving at a lead compound is estimated to be\naround .001 and the work load the joint venture is expected to carry would be\nanywhere from four thousand to ten thousand samples a year .\n\n\nFrom each lead compound , one or more drugs might be developed , each\ncould have a potential of sales on the average of US&dollar;200 million .\n\n\nChinese scientists in Beijing and Shanghai will be involved in this\nresearch programme of the joint venture . \n\n \n\nThe term \" &lsquo; decentralised concentration &rsquo;\n\" has been coined by the OECD , however , to describe a more likely\nand feasible way of structuring the biotechnological industry .\n\n\nHere , a small group of researchers would join a patent-holder in a\nresearch institute or large-scale industrial establishment with a view to\ndeveloping commercial products . \n\n \n\nAs the launching phase draws near , the group will be ready to\nspin off to form an independent business unit .\n\n\nSubsequently , the structure of the industry will resemble a stellar\nconfiguration with smaller business units attached to bigger corporations .\n\n\nThe greater strategic flexibility when the business units continue to\ndemonstrate their innovativeness . \n\n \n\nThe key factors for success , at least at this stage , include :\n( 1 ) adequate incentives from the government ( which do\nnot yet exist ) ; ( 2 ) cooperation with Chinese\nscientists in R &ampersand; D; and ( 3 ) a continuous dialogue\nbetween researchers and industrialists . \n\n \n\nThe initiative taken by industries in R &ampersand; D activities\nin the US has been attributed mainly to tax incentives granted by the US\ngovernment .\n\n\nIt is hoped that the same sort of environment can be created locally\nto foster biotechnological R &ampersand; D .\n\n\nIt is also believed that industrial R &ampersand; D fares better if\nthe task of coordinating related activities is left to the private sector .\n\n\n \n\nThere is no denying , however , that the exchange of ideas ,\nespecially innovative ones , between local industrialists and scientists is\nstill restricted to formalities that preclude references to anything that\nresembles business intelligence .\n\n\nAlso what should be ongoing communication between the two groups is\nvery often reduced to a one-shot deal and there is rarely a true meeting of\nminds .\n\n\nThis is largely an issue of attitude .\n\n\nPresumably there is ample room for Hong Kong industrialists to\nimprove communication with scientists . \n\n \n\nQuite a few entrepreneurial researchers have already been lured\nback to Hong Kong by setting up of bio-technological R &ampersand; D\nfacilities at the Hong Kong Institute of Biotechnology and the Hong Kong\nUniversity of Science and Technology .\n\n\nTogether with both local and Chinese scientists , they will no doubt\nbe able to find a place among the foremost biotechnological research teams .\n\n\nIt may be worth repeating here that the R &ampersand; D capability of\nChinese scientists in this area has been described to be nothing short of\noutstanding . \n\n \n\nIt is almost certain that the world will benefit as much from\nbiotechnology as from the computer-based technology .\n\n\nThere will be rapidly expanding global market for biotechnological\nproducts .\n\n\nTo capitalise on this opportunity , Hong Kong should focus on a\nmarket niche , exploit the learning curve , build up economies of scale and\npreempt that niche . \n\n \n\nThat is ,   after all  , what staying\ncompetitive is all about .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "998abd92-aaa3-4b8e-bd7f-d03238233763", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.010456+00:00"}

we have identified one discrepancy which will require 35\napplication programs to be changed .\n\n\nWithout a detail testing , we are not sure whether there are other\ncompatibility problems and surprises . \n\n \n\nIf you see any potential problems with version 2.1.2.6. , please\nadvise us soonest so that we can adjust , if possible . \n\n \n\nAgain , I will stress on the importance of on-site technical\nsupport during the first few days of implementation .\n\n\nWe will need someone to look at the problem , provide very quick\nanswers and suggestions if problems crop up during the

phase-in\nimplementation approach .\n\n\nThis approach will take about three weeks , and will be implemented\nin three phases . \n\n \n\nIn the first phase , COSAC 2 will process cargo information for\na small number of airlines .\n\n\nAll cargo information processing for the rest of the airlines\ncommunity will be done through COSAC 1 .\n\n\nDuring the second phase , all airlines being handled in Terminal 2\nwill be cut-over to COSAC 2 .\n\n\nThe third and the final phase will see all airlines being processed\nthrough COSAC 2 . \n\n \n\nWe have discussed in detail with your Mr. Cranford Yu on the\nimpact and opportunities for Traxon and the resulting from the COSAC 2\nimplementation .\n\n\nYour assistance and support will contribute greatly to the success\nof this phase-in approach .\n\n\nWe therefore request your help in maintaining two separate Traxon\nlinks on COSAC 1 and COSAC 2 .\n\n\nThe COSAC 1 link is the existing screen/SNA linkage .\n\n\nThe new COSAC 2 link  uses  the TCP/X25 link , with message\npassing techniques .\n\n\nTraxon users can use different Traxon screens screens to inquire\nboth COSAC 1 and 2 information .\n\n\nError message modules , for both links , would be prepared by HACTL\nto prompt Traxon users to use the appropriate link . \n\n \n\nPlease confirm if this arrangement is acceptable to you . \n\n\nYours sincerely ,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n5 October

your letter of 26th September 1994 .\n\n\nI have to apologize for the delay of this reply as I had been very\nbusy in organizing a workshop which took place last weekend . \n\n \n\nThere is an unwritten house rule in Hong Kong Arts Centre to\nreserve two house seats in the Shouson Theatre and Lim Por Yen Theatre for\nany Hong Kong Arts Centre presentation or film screening to cater for\nprotocol or unexpected needs .\n\n\nThe duty Manager has the authority to release these seats right\nbefore the show .\n\n\nThe Box Office usually will let all the patrons to mark down their\nnames on the waiting list , once the Duty Manager releases the house seats ,\nthe names on the list will be announced in order . \n\n \n\nIn investigating the incident stated in your said letter , the\nDuty Manager released the house seats at around 5:30 p.m. on that day and\nthe box office assistant sold those seats on a first come first serve basis .\n\n\n \n\nAs all tickets for that   screening  were sold out , I believe the other vacant seats were present as a result of last minute unavailability of some patrons who had booked their tickets say one month in advance . \n\n \n\nI am sorry to hear that you have such an unhappy feeling in\nthat evening .\n\n\nThe Hong Kong Arts Centre is the largest independent art\norganization in Hong Kong encouraging freedom of expression in arts without\ndiscrimination .\n\n\nI can assure you that racial discrimination is something the Hong\nKong Arts Centre will definitely not exercise or encourage . \n\n \n\nThank you for writing to us and I look forward to your\ncontinuous support to the Hong Kong Arts Centre programmes . \n\n\nYours sincerely ,\n\n\nHONG KONG ARTS CENTRE\n\n\n\n\n\nJackie Ma\n\n\nChief Executive\n\n\ncc.\n\n\nMr.

{"text": "Don't blame our students for their poor performance \n \n\n\n OPEN FORUM   \n\n\n Catherine Ng  \n\n \n\nI have always been of the opinion that since only about one in\nfive teenagers in Hong Kong gets admitted to universities , tertiary students\ncannot be that bad . \n\n \n\nSo if we feel that their learning attitude , language ability and\nsocial skills are poor beyond belief - as media reports have recently\nsuggested - there must be something wrong with society as well as the\neducational system .\n\n\nStudents should not have to bear all the blame and responsibility for\nsuch a sorry state of affairs . \n\n \n\nThat is not to say that I enjoy teaching them . I , like many of\nmy colleagues , find teaching undergraduates increasingly dissatisfying .\n\n\nI also find that students today lack learning spirit , are unwilling\nto express themselves in English in class and are inconsiderate ,\nuncooperative and immature . \n\n \n\nI once remonstrated with my students about their lack of\ninitiative to look up material beyond lecture notes and PowerPoint slide\nhandouts .\n\n\nOne retorted: \" University students these days are really bad ,\nMiss .\n\n\nDon't expect much of us . &rdquo;\n\n\nI have come to the conclusion that a lot of the students , rather\nthan feeling shame about their inability to learn , are instead assertive in\ndemanding to be spoonfed knowledge . \n\n \n\nMost experienced university lecturers would agree that teaching\nevening-class mature students is more satisfying than teaching undergraduates .\n\n\nWe also know that teaching final-year undergraduates is easier than\nteaching first-year freshmen .\n\n\nTeaching electives is better than teaching compulsory core subjects ,\nand teaching small classes of 15 or so is far more gratifying than giving\nmass lectures by cramming in 200 students .\n\n\nIn such lectures , students come in late - if they come at all - talk\namong themselves or on their mobiles , read newspapers and take naps . \n\n \n\nIronically , there is at least a handful of students in each mass\nlecture who fully comprehend our English lessons and are eager to listen to\nthe lecturer  ' s every word .\n\n\nThey are usually as angry and frustrated as the lecturer about the\nnoise their classmates make .\n\n\nMy heart goes out to this minority because they are the most\nshortchanged by educational institutions . \n\n \n\nIn spite of all of this , I emphasise that I still believe we\nshould not be bashing students .\n\n\nThe top 20 per cent of the youth population cannot be that hopeless .\n\n\nThis is reflected by teachers ' interactions with students outside\nclass .\n\n\nAlthough students behave unforgivably in classes , they are quite\ndifferent when I talk to them on an individual basis , or in small groups .\n\n\nThe same bunch , unmanageable in lectures , turn more polite ,\nconsiderate and sympathetic to their teacher  ' s difficulties .\n\n\nThey are more willing to listen and learn beyond the textbook , to\naccept challenges , debate and critically evaluate learning material , and\neven more willing to listen to and speak in English . \n\n \n\nNot all , but most of my students come across as moderately well\nrounded , mature adults when I talk to them in my office or during breaks or\nin committee meetings , yet I find them intolerably immature in class .\n\n\nI am sure the feeling is mutual .\n\n\nThey probably find me a more approachable , amiable , human and fun\nperson when I am not lecturing them along with 200 others on a core subject\nin which they may or may not have any interest but which they are compelled\nto take . \n\n \n\nHerein lies one of the keys to overhauling university education .\n\n\nIn recent years , universities have pushed too hard , too fast for\nresearch and publication , to the detriment of teaching quality .\n\n\nWhile I am not against putting pressure on academic staff to engage\nin more research , the pendulum has swung too far , without properly\nbalancing a lecturer  ' s duty to publish and their duty to look after students .\n\n\n \n\nTheoretically , the more academics engage in scholarly activities\n, the wider and deeper their knowledge becomes , and this can only benefit\nteaching quality because they have more knowledge to impart and inspire .\nHowever , the reality is that intense research pressure is causing a lot of\nlecturers to withdraw into the more solitary pursuits of writing , designing\nquestionnaires and undertaking other activities to further their research .\nThey have become less inclined to spend informal time with their students .\n\n\n \n\nTo give teachers more time to do research , university management\nis combining classes , further reducing lecturers ' contact hours with\nstudents .\n\n\nResources are channelled into upgrading sound and visual equipment to\nmake lectures look good .\n\n\nMoney is being spent to build better and more classrooms . \n\n \n\nBut all this ignores the fact that the quality of students ' class\nlife is being lowered .\n\n\nStudents find themselves speaking less and listening more , partly\nbecause classes are larger and partly because most feel more intimidated by\nthe idea of speaking up in front of so many people . \n\n \n\nThey feel exhausted attending too many big classes and not enough\nsmaller , more lively ones .\n\n\nAs the distance between students and teachers widens , fewer students\nfeel motivated to chat with their teachers , while teachers themselves have\nbecome less patient in interacting with students . \n\n \n\nStudents need nurture and care .\n\n\nIf universities continue to disenfranchise teachers from providing\nthis to students , we only have ourselves to blame for the declining\nstandards of student behaviour and knowledge . \n\n \n\n Catherine Ng is an assistant professor in the Department of\nManagement at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University  \n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Democrats may have their troubles , but how long will the DAB\nlast as political toadies to the administration , asks  Claudia Mo \n \n\n\n The party born to be Beijing  ' s ` footman '  \n\n \n\n THERE HAS BEEN  much talk about the future , or the\nlack of it , of the Democratic Party , and how it is hampered by its own\nanti-Beijing stance .\n\n\nBut the same can be said about the Democratic Alliance for the\nBetterment of Hong Kong (  DAB ) - though for the opposite reason that the DAB\n's pro-Beijing position is unlikely to lead it anywhere either . \n\n \n\nThe ultimate goal of a political party is to grab ruling power ,\nalthough it remains arguable that party politics has already been shunned in\nthe SAR , with the Government establishing the rule that whoever becomes\nChief Executive must sever party links . \n\n \n\nUnder the existing system of selecting a Chief Executive , it\nseems no Democrat could ever make it into that office .\n\n\nNeither could a member of the DAB , such as its chairman Tsang\nYok-sing , because that would mean overstepping the bounds Beijing has\nprescribed for the office . \n\n \n\nChina  ' s line of thinking over how the SAR should be run was made\nclear before the handover , when Tung Chee-hwa was favoured for his business\nconnections and his lack of visible political ties .\n\n\nThis helped minimise political agitation in the SAR . After all , as\nfar as Beijing is concerned , stability and prosperity come first . \n\n \n\nUnlike the Democratic Party , which enjoys a clear-cut image as a\nresistance force , the DAB  ' s position is becoming increasingly blurred .\n\n\nAlthough it could never go into opposition , it is also losing its\nrole as the Government  ' s staunch defender . \n\n \n\nDuring a meet-the-press session earlier this year , Mr Tsang\nhimself catalogued the DAB  ' s public-relations weak points as being pro-China\nand playing \" the emperor  ' s guards &rdquo; for the Government .\n\n\nMore recently , he again publicly lamented that government officials\nalways assumed the DAB was their rescue team and that \" when we\ndisagree with the Government on barely one issue out of 10 , they are very\nunhappy\" .\n\n\nThat perception of the DAB playing \" firemen &rdquo; is shared\nby the population at large . \n\n \n\nAlthough the Government has now expressed its desire to count\nmore on the backing of the business sector - as reflected in the recent call\nby Chief Secretary for Administration Donald Tsang Yam-kuen for businessmen\nto join politics - it still needs to garner the supporting votes of the DAB\nin the Legislative Council .\n\n\nThis has prompted a situation in which although the party wishes to\nappear less pro-establishment , it knows it cannot go too far in this\ndirection . \n\n \n\nThat has resulted in a shift of its stance on quite a few issues .\n\n\nExamples range from the call for the sacking of Andrew Lo Cheung-on ,\nMr Tung  ' s senior special assistant , for his alleged role in putting\npressure on University of Hong Kong pollster Robert Chung Ting-yiu to scale\nback surveys on the Chief Executive  ' s popularity , to toll hikes for the\nCross-Harbour Tunnel in 1999 .\n\n\nIn both cases , DAB legislators were at first seen to be going along\nwith public opinion - which favoured Mr Lo  ' s sacking and the rejection of\nthe toll increases - but finally gave in and supported the Government  ' s\nwishes .  \n\n \n\nIncidents of this kind involving the DAB have certainly further\nput off those Hong Kong people who were never the party  ' s fans in the first\nplace .\n\n\nAlthough it is broadly accepted that the party disagrees with the\nGovernment on local livelihood matters , it is understood by all that when it\ncomes to defending Beijing-related political or ideological issues , the DAB\nhas to be there , bang on cue . \n\n \n\nThe party  ' s function of influencing public opinion , as far as\nthe Government is concerned , might be weakening .\n\n\nSince former chief secretary for administration Anson Chan Fang\nOn-sang  ' s departure earlier this year , top government officials have\nevidently become more daring and almost strident about defending policies on\ntheir own , adopting a kind of like-it-or-leave-it attitude , as displayed by\nSecretary for Security Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee and Secretary for Justice Elsie\nLeung Oi-sie on the security and legal fronts . \n\n \n\nMr Tsang Yok-sing and his veteran left-wing comrades are also\nlosing out in the patriots ' games .\n\n\nSince the handover , their competitors have popped up in various\nshapes and forms , including patriotic businessmen and delegates to the\nNational People  ' s Congress and the Chinese People  ' s Political Consultative\nConference .\n\n\nMany of these people consider themselves more senior in social as\nwell as political echelons , regarding themselves as butlers - or even guests\n- of the master , while DAB types are mere footmen . \n\n \n\nThe DAB chairman is a fairly appealing , if not charismatic ,\npolitical leader .\n\n\nHis intellectual flair often charms his audiences .\n\n\nBut his less intellectually blessed colleagues often prove to be\nembarrassing , making tactless remarks which to some amount to intellectual\npoverty .\n\n\nDAB legislator Chan Kam-lam equated Mrs Chan , upon her departure ,\nto any doorman stationed outside government headquarters , while fellow party\nlegislator Ip Kwok-him accused legislator Emily Lau Wai-hing of \" only\nwanting to satisfy personal desires &rdquo; over Ms Lau  ' s plan to force a\ndisclosure of confidential details linked to the recent award of the Grand\nBauhinia Medal to Yeung Kwong , a 1967 riots ringleader . \n\n \n\nBut this does not mean the death of the DAB .\n\n\nWith Beijing  ' s endorsement , it never seems to worry about money .\n\n\nAlthough it might be losing clout in a number of ways , it is still\ndeemed a necessary \" grassroots organisation &rdquo; outside official\norgans .\n\n\nIndeed , it still commands strong , traditional left-wing support ,\nmuch of it from the working class . \n\n \n\nOne danger lurks , however , as whatever the DAB can offer to\nworkers , so can unionist legislators Lau Chin-shek and Lee Cheuk-yan .\n\n\nThese two Frontier members often quip that they are the only genuine\nleftists . \n\n \n\nThe DAB will lose its substance as a political party but will\nremain an ideological group with rising Chinese nationalism as its key\nbinding force .\n\n\nThe difference between feeling ethnically Chinese and being\npolitically Chinese , however , should be noted .\n\n\nAnd Hong Kong  ' s China fever will essentially feature the dollar sign .\n\n\n \n\n Claudia Mo Man-ching is a Hong Kong-based journalist and\ncommentator  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Lawmakers who can't make law   \n\n\nGovernment manipulation is eroding legislators ' ability to function ,\nsays  Andrew Cheng  \n\n \n\n A CLAUSE IN THE  Basic Law , which limits\nlegislators ' power to introduce private-member  ' s bills , has been so\nmanipulated by the Government that it makes a mockery of the power vested in\nthe SAR legislature under the Sino-British Joint Declaration . \n\n \n\nIn Hong Kong , private-member  ' s bills were once major catalysts\nfor law reform .\n\n\nOne well-known example was former legislator Anna Wu Hung-yuk  ' s\nattempt to introduce anti-discrimination laws in 1994 .\n\n\nWith strong public support , Ms Wu  ' s move eventually prompted the\nthen-colonial government to enact laws against discrimination due to sex and\ndisability , and to set up the Equal Opportunities Commission , of which Ms\nWu is now the chairperson . \n\n \n\nIn the legislative session of 1996-1997 alone , 40 private-\nmember  ' s bills were introduced and 22 of them became law .\n\n\nHowever , in the first term of the post-handover Legislative Council\n, only two private-member  ' s bills were tabled .\n\n\nWhy is this so ?\n\n\nAre legislators becoming lazier ? \n\n \n\nThe answer lies in the Article 74 of the Basic Law , under which\nmembers of Legco are prohibited from introducing bills relating to \"\npublic expenditure\" , \" political structure\" , or \" the operation of\nthe Government\" .\n\n\nIf interpreted broadly , these restrictions can effectively strip\nlegislators of the power to initiate any bills at all . \n\n \n\nOf these restrictions , the only one that applied during the\ncolonial era was the one on public expenditure - or \" charging effect\"\n, as it was then termed - but even then the restriction was not absolute , as\nthe governor could exercise his discretion to allow such a bill to be tabled .\n\n\nThe Basic Law , the SAR  ' s mini-constitution , does not give the\nChief Executive such discretionary power . \n\n \n\nWhat is more , the concept of \" relate to public\nexpenditure &rdquo; seems to cover a much wider scope than \" charging\neffect &rdquo; did before the handover .\n\n\nIt can mean a possible increase in public expenditure or a possible\ndecrease .\n\n\nIt can also be extended to mean consequential and incidental\ngovernment spending . \n\n \n\nFor instance , Legco president Rita Fan Hsu Lai-tai ruled\nagainst the introduction of a Fair Competition Bill proposed by democrats\nFred Li Wah-ming and Sin Chung-kai because it was related to \" public\nexpenditure\" , although the bill did not directly impose any obligation on\nthe Government to spend more . \n\n \n\nBut Mrs Fan seemed to be satisfied with the Government  ' s\nargument that the bill could result in more legal action against anti-\ncompetitive behaviour , which would increase the court  ' s workload and thus\nultimately cost the Government more .\n\n\nApplying the logic of this ruling , it is virtually impossible for\nlegislators to propose any bill that creates new legal rights . \n\n \n\nAlthough it is perfectly legitimate to interpret the various\nrestrictions of Article 74 in a literal way and give them a wide meaning , it\nis also possible to read them in a narrower way .\n\n\nAnd if we agree that the Basic Law gives legislators the power to\ninitiate laws , it is logical and reasonable that a more lenient\ninterpretation should be adopted . \n\n \n\nIn addition to the already-mentioned three \" forbidden\nareas\" , Article 74 also requires a legislator to seek the Chief Executive  ' s\nconsent before being able to introduce any bill relating to \"\ngovernment policies\" .\n\n\nWhat criteria the Chief Executive should adopt to exercise his\ndiscretion is anyone  ' s guess . \n\n \n\nEarlier this year , I sought to introduce the Employment ( \nAmendment ) Bill to give employees more protection against wage cuts forced on\nthem by employers .\n\n\nDespite strong support from workers , my application for the Chief\nExecutive  ' s consent to introduce the bill was turned down .\n\n\nThe Government claimed the bill was inconsistent with its policy of\nnot regulating wage reductions by legislation . \n\n \n\nRecently , I also proposed the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes\n( Amendment ) Bill , but the Government said my attempt to raise the minimum\nmonthly income level at which an employee becomes liable for MPF\ncontributions from &dollar;4,000 to &dollar;6,000 conflicted with government\npolicy , which intended to provide its own mechanism for adjusting the income\nlevel at which employees became liable to pay contributions .\n\n\nHowever , the Government has not established any such mechanism .\n\n\n \n\nSince the handover , Article 74 has been effectively manipulated\nby the Government to defeat legislators ' attempts to initiate legislative\nchanges . \n\n \n\nThe Chinese Government acknowledged in the Joint Declaration\nthat the legislative power of the SAR shall be vested in the SAR  ' s\nlegislature , and Article 73(1 ) of the Basic Law empowers the SAR legislature\nto \" enact , amend or repeal laws in accordance with the provisions of\n[ the Basic Law ) and legal procedures\" . \n\n \n\nLogically , Legco  ' s law-making function should not be confined\nto passing bills submitted by the Government but should also include the\npower to propose legislative measures . \n\n \n\nIn a study of parliaments in more than 80 countries , the Inter-\nParliamentary Union concluded that \" it is implicit in the concept of\ndemocracy that the initiative in law-making should vest with the elected\nparliament\" . \n\n \n\nLegco  ' s law-making is being eroded , causing people to lose\nconfidence in their elected representatives .\n\n\nTo enable legislators to perform their law-making function as stated\nin the Basic Law , the Government should give the various restrictions a\nnarrower and more specific meaning .\n\n\nThis is consistent with the purpose of Article 73(1 ) of the Basic\nLaw and the central Government  ' s declared basic policies towards the SAR .\n\n\n \n\nIn the long run , if the SAR is to move towards a more\ndemocratic society , the restrictions imposed under Article 74 should be\nrepealed . \n\n \n\n Andrew Cheng Kar-foo is a Democratic Party legislator", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "9dcd42e6-b892-4b24-995e-7846011a7ad0", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.013032+00:00"}
{"text": "A Chinese Wedding  \n\n \n\nFor as long as Amy could remember , Chinese had meant food: spring\nrolls , fried rice ,  mushu  pork &scol; one from Column A and\ntwo from Column B &scol; the Ho Sai Gai on Race Street in Chinatown , its\nname spelt out in spiky , bamboo letters on the garish violet and vermilion\nneon sign that flashed all night above its red doors. \n\n \n\nAnd now - sitting in the midst of the wedding banquet watching\nhundreds of Cantonese apply themselves to a heaped platter of food the menu\ncalls  '  Four seasons starter  '  - now that she has spent several months in Hong\nKong , living with a Chinese family the whole time &scol; now , in fact ,\nthat she has just married a Chinese man (  here she looks across the table to\nwhere he is leaning over to talk to her mother , his shoulders square under\nthe hired tuxedo jacket and his stiff black hair swept back , held in place\nby gel , his face already brick red from the brandy - now she knows that in\none respect she was absolutely right: the Chinese , at least the six million\nwho live in Hong Kong , are totally absorbed by the getting , the preparation\n, the presentation and , most important of all , the consumption of food .\n\n\n \n\nDo other people make eating such a central part of their culture ?\n\n\nShe wonders , smoothing the heavy brocaded red silk of the wedding\ndress over her thighs .\n\n\nNot the Irish , that  ' s for sure: Uncle Mike would eat his own shoes\nif you sat him down at the table and served them to him covered with ketchup .\n\n\nAnd if you gave him a few beers to wash them down with , he  ' d\nprobably smack his lips and ask for more . \n\n \n\nThe Italians maybe: pasta , pasta , pasta , though , and cheese or\ntomato on everything , at least in South Philadelphia .\n\n\nPeople always claimed to know the best places - little family-run\nrestaurants , tucked away in a side-street - a little nervous , it  ' d be dusk\nand people would seem to be staring , it was a tough neighbourhood .\n\n\nFinally , you  ' d come to a dusty glass door that looked as though it\nhad been sealed since Christmas and realize with a sinking heart and a twinge\nof hunger that the place was closed. \n\n \n\nHere , she admits to herself , she is thinking of Richard: he\nalways said he knew the best restaurant , the latest place , be it Italian or\nEthiopian , always swore it was the only one to go to , then could never find\nit , or it would be shut .\n\n\n'Sorry , sorry, ' he  ' d say in that blurry , nasal rush ,'too bad ,\ntoo bad , ah , ah , unfortunately they  ' re not open. ' \n\n \n\nIrritating man , she thinks .\n\n\nThank God he faded away , or thank God I faded him away , turned off\nthe set and watched him dwindle into a tiny spot like one of the old black\nand whites we had when I was a kid. \n\n \n\nAmy shifts her backside and tugs surreptitiously at the sides of\nthe dress , a   kuah   it is called , she has been\ntold repeatedly .\n\n\nThe heavy silk is smotheringly warm and she can feel a sheen of sweat\non her thighs , popping through the pores of the unfamiliar stockings .\n\n\nShe pulls too hard and feels herself starting to slide , the silk\n  kuah   slipping easily over the vinyl of the seat .\n\n\nShe clutches the sides of the chair and digs the stiletto heels into\nthe carpet to check herself , then slides carefully back into an upright\nposition. \n\n \n\nShe looks around but nobody has noticed &scol; most of the people\non the other tables seem to be too busy eating .\n\n\nAnyway , even if she had disappeared under the table , all the\nChinese would just assume she was drunk .\n\n\nAll   gweilos   , foreign devils , are drunks\n, it seems , even the women &scol; so her prospective sisters-in-laws had\ntold her , the two eldest , the nasty ones , the ugly sisters. \n\n \n\nAmy glances to he left .\n\n\nWinston  ' s second eldest sister , Mei Yoke , is sitting one place\naway from her .\n\n\nTheir eyes meet and Mei Yoke stares back unblinking so that Amy\nfinally looks away from the pockmarked , heavily powered mask , thinking\n&scol; She really doesn't like me .\n\n\nWhat did I ever do to her? \n\n \n\nComposing herself , she picks up her glass of hot tea and takes a\ndeliberate , dainty sip . \n\n \n\nA fine omen that would be , anyway , the bride disappearing under\nthe table during the first course .\n\n\nFrom the evidence of the elaborate preparations to ensure good luck\nfor the wedding - the consultations with the astrologer , the peculiar\nrituals , the endless worries about auspicious timing - the Lees would cancel\nthe whole thing .\n\n\nThey would probably pack her back to Philadelphia in one of the\ncrates they use at the factory , the box simply marked in huge red Chinese\ncharacters ,  ' unlucky bride ' . \n\n \n\nA giggle building up inside , slightly hysterical , threatens to\nburst out , chasing her racing thoughts upward .\n\n\nShe smothers it with a cough and something catches at the back of her\nthroat so that she has to hack a few times to get it out .\n\n\nShe feels a heavy hand clap her on the back and turns with a smile ,\nnodding her thanks to win  ' s mother &scol; to her new mother-in-law , she\nshould say .\n\n\nThey haven't really been married , not in a church , but who  ' s\ncounting ?\n\n\nOnly my mother , Amy thinks ruefully . \n\n \n\nShe smiles again , nodding her head foolishly , muttering \n  ' M'goi , m'goi '   ,'thank you , thank , you ' , under\nher breath , the only Cantonese words with which she feels safe .\n\n\nWin  ' s mother smiles back , nodding her head , flashing her gold\ntooth .\n\n\nAs always she looks a little alarmed when Amy addresses her in\nCantonese , as though afraid that she won't understand a word her new\ndaughter-in-law is saying and will be forced to sit there smiling mutely like\na fool until someone breaks into help. \n\n \n\n'Is everything all right? ' Win asks from , across the table ,\nlooking up from his conversation with Amy  ' s mother , an expression of\nconcern on his face that causes something down in he region of Amy  ' s stomach\nto flop over with happiness . \n\n \n\n'No , no, ' she says , waving her hand in the air , almost\ntoppling over the glass of tea with the long sleeve of the   kuah\n  .\n\n\n'I  ' m fine .\n\n\nIt  ' s just a frog in the throat. ' \n\n \n\n'A frog? ' says Win slowly .\n\n\nHe looks stunned by the brandy . \n\n \n\n'You know, ' everyone else is listening to their conversation ,  ' a\ncatch , a rasp , a burr , a frog in the throat.'\n\n\nShe gestures vaguely at her own neck , this time wary of the swinging\nsleeve. \n\n \n\n'Yes , I see. ' Win purses his lips .\n\n\n'It  ' s probably heatiness .\n\n\nTake a drink , some tea , that will help. ' \n\n \n\nHe speaks rapidly to his mother who immediately pushes her own\nglass of tea towards Amy , sucking the tablecloth up in her haste , nodding\nagain and smiling .\n\n\nAmy shakes her head , smiling back: they must look like a couple of\nthose stupid dogs that sit in the back of cars and wag their heads. \n\n \n\n'No , thanks , I  ' m fine now , really.  \n\n\nM'oi , m'oi .\n\n\nYi ga ho  .   '  \n\n \n\nMrs Lee looks dubious , obviously finding the attempt at\nCantonese indecipherable as usual , so Amy carefully takes a sip of her own\ntea , smiling again and patting herself on the sternum to show she has\nrecovered , pushing the proffered glass back across the table . \n\n \n\nApparently mollified , Mrs Lee turns back to her plate. \n\n \n\nWhat am I supposed to call her anyway ?\n\n\nAmy wonders , Mom ?\n\n\nMrs Lee ?\n\n\nI don't even know her Christian name &scol; not that she has one , of\ncourse , not being Christian .\n\n\nShe probably doesn't even have a real first name either .\n\n\nThe Chinese put their personal names after the family name , that Amy\nrealized before .\n\n\nFair enough .\n\n\nBut to complicate things , they usually also have two personal names\n, which are sometimes used together , sometimes separately , sometimes not at\nall , as in the case of close relatives who often call each other by their\nrank in the family: third uncle on mother  ' s side , or whatever , which\nsounds clumsy in English but manages to fit into one word in Cantonese .\n\n\nTake Mei Yoke .\n\n\nHer family name is Lee , of course , like Win , and her personal name\n, Mei Yoke , comes after that , though family and friends usually drop the\nfirst part and just call her  ' Yoke ' .\n\n\nHer younger brothers though call her  '   Jie   '  for\nelder sister. \n\n \n\nAll of which leaves Amy , blessed with only her paltry single ,\ncropped little American name , feeling rather inadequate .\n\n\nAnd , to make things worse , all the Lees call her  '   A-mee'\n , which she was told by a giggling Mei Mei , the youngest daughter ,\nsounds something like  \n\n \n\nAmy remembers the first time Win tried to teach her to say his\nname , early on &scol; the first time they really talked , in fact , over a\ncup of coffee in Hardees .\n\n\nShe had asked what exactly he did in Hong Kong and he had fumbled in\nhis wallet and produced a business card with his name on it: Winston G.F .\nLee , Senior Executive , Tong Fat Electrical and Toys Manufacturer , then an\naddress in Hong Kong. \n\n \n\n'What does the G.F . stand for? ' \n\n \n\n\" Winston Gah Fatt Lee, ' he  ' d said .\n\n\nIt was a grey winter afternoon , all the lamps on already though it\nwas only three o'clock , the light bleeding out of the day outside. \n\n \n\n'That  ' s my full name .\n\n\nMy Chinese name and my western name. ' \n\n \n\n'Say it again .\n\n\nThe Chinese part in the middle. ' She had called him win until then.\n\n\n \n\n'Gah Fatt. ' \n\n \n\n'Um ... gay fat, ' she repeated after him. \n\n \n\n'You are teasing me. ' \n\n \n\n'No , no , I  ' m just trying to say it right. ' \n\n \n\n'Not \" Gay\" .\n\n\nIt  ' s \" gah\" , like g with \" ah &rdquo; after it .\n\n\nLike what you say at the doctor  ' s office: ahhhhh .\n\n\nAnd it  ' s not \" fat &rdquo; like Buddha either , it sounds like\n\" father &rdquo; .\n\n\nThe beginning of \" father &rdquo;. ' \n\n \n\n'Gaah Faat. ' \n\n \n\n'That  ' s better , yes .\n\n\nTry once more. ' \n\n \n\n'Gaahhhh Faaaaaat.'\n\n\nShe rolls out the sounds , gurgling a little. \n\n \n\n'Now you are teasing again .\n\n\nYou sound like you are a dog. ' \n\n \n\n'Who are you calling a dog , buster?'\n\n\nShe pokes him in the arm lightly .\n\n\n'That  ' s not a nice thing to say to a lady in this country , you\nknow. ' \n\n \n\n'I wanted to say that you sound like you are calling a dog. ' \n\n \n\n'Sound like a dog ?\n\n\nLook like a dog .\n\n\nYou really know how to complement a girl .\n\n\nWoof , woof! ' \n\n \n\nHe had given her a baffled smile and picked up his coffee cup .\n\n\nAfter a while , she had held the card up in the air again and said:  ' What  ' s\nthis toy company? ' \n\n \n\n'My family business. ' \n\n \n\n'So you  ' re rich ?\n\n\nThat  ' s good. ' \n\n \n\n'No , we have no money , business is very bad .\n\n\nThe recession here in America means no one is buying toys. ' \n\n \n\n'Just toys ?\n\n\nIt says electrical , too. ' \n\n \n\n'Electrical things too , yes. ' \n\n \n\n'Oh. ' \n\n \n\nShe  ' d looked at the card again .\n\n\nThe flip side was covered with Chinese writing , three large\ncharacters in the middle , the rest smaller , strung in scratchy columns down\nthe right-hand side. \n\n \n\n'If it wasn't for the characters , no one would ever know you\nwere Chinese .\n\n\nDo you always write your name Winston G.F . Lee , or is that just\nfor America? ' \n\n \n\n'No , that is how I always write it on the card. ' \n\n \n\n'Winston G.F . Lee, ' she repeats .\n\n\n'You could be a second hand car salesman from Atlanta or someplace ,\nyou know: \" Winston Lee , pleased to meetcha an take a lookee rite heer\nat this lil beauty , not a scratch on her , only two thousand on the clock\nand a fresh set of whitewalls I put on myself just yesterday.\" ' \n\n \n\nHe had smiled at her again with a puzzled but , she noticed then\nfor the first time , affectionate look: after that he always smiled at her\njokes &scol; sometimes he even laughed. \n\n \n\n'Then you  ' d tell them, ' she had continued ,  ' if you were this\nWinston Gaylord Farmington (  his mama  ' s name , of course ) Lee , you  ' d tell  ' em:\n\" The owner was a preacher , ya see , never used the car , bicycled\naround town .\n\n\nIt was his second car , anyway , his wife  ' s car , and she never\ndrove on account she was confined to a wheelchair , wasting disease ,\ncouldn't drive , a terrible tragedy .\n\n\nOnly five-ninety-nine to you . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nShe flourished the empty plastic cup. \n\n \n\n'And then you  ' d have made a sale .\n\n\nMaybe you should think about taking up that line of work .\n\n\nIt  ' s a lot easier than beating your brains out to get an MBA ,\nisn't it?

{"text": "Diabetic complications and their implications on health care in Asia\n  \n\n\nGM Leung , KSL Lam \n\n \n\n\nDiabetes mellitus is a growing problem in the Asia-Pacific region .\n\n\nThe acute and chronic complications of diabetes mellitus are major\ncauses of hospital admissions , blindness , renal failure , amputations ,\nstroke , and coronary heart disease in this region .\n\n\nCompared with general population , the annual per capita health care\nexpenditure is estimated to be four-fold for people for diabetes .\n\n\nRecent prospective studies have provided unequivocal evidence for the\ncrucial role of prolonged hyperglycaemia in the development of chronic\ndiabetic complications .\n\n\nAlthough the aetiology of hyperglyaemia-induced damage of the kidneys\n, eyes , nerves , and arteries still remains to be elucidated , observational\nand inter-ventional studies show that the occurrence and progression of these\ncomplications can be prevented by the optimal control of blood glucose ,\nhypertension , and dyslipidaemia .\n\n\nLifestyle changes such as weight control , increased physical exercise\n, and smoking cessation are also potentially beneficial in preventing\ndiabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease .\n\n\nFurthermore , the morbidity and mortality caused by diabetes mellitus\ncan be reduced by secondary prevention through regular screening , early\ndetection , and appropriate treatment of chronic complications .\n\n\nImproved diabetes education is needed among health professionals as\nwell as the general and diabetes populations .\n\n\nGovernment and public health officials should be mindful of the\neconomic impact of this major health problem so that adequate health care\nresources can be allocated for the primary and secondary prevention of\ndiabetes complications .    \n\n\nIntroduction  \n\n \n\nThere is a growing epidemic of diabetes mellitus , type 2 in\nparticular , in the Asia-Pacific region.  1 \n\n\nAccording to current estimates , this region has the largest diabetes\npopulation in the world - namely , 47.3 million , which is 46% of the global\nburden of diabetes.  2 \n\n\nPopulation-based surveys from Asia show a wide range of prevalence\nrates of diabetes mellitus: from 1.3% in Vietnam to 24.2% in certain India\nurban communities.  3-5 \n\n\nNo doubt some of the reasons for the variability are differences in\nthe age range surveyed , study methodology , sampling techniques , and\ncriteria used to classify diabetes mellitus .\n\n\nNevertheless , there is a rapidly increasing trend in the prevalence\nof the disease in Asian countries .\n\n\nFor example , the prevalence has increased approximately three-fold ,\nfrom 0.8% to 2.3% , between 1986 and 1994 in China.  6 \n\n\nMore recent data from certain Chinese cities suggest this increase\nmay be even more pronounced , with a prevalence of as high as 9.2% in Hong\nKong.  7 \n\n\nThe epidemiological transition from life-threatening infectious\ndisease towards more chronic conditions ,  ' westernisation ' in diet and\nlifestyle practices , and effects of'thirty genes ' together probably account\nfor this dynamic epidemic of diabetes mellitus in Asia.  2  \n\n \n\nDiabetes is a major source of morbidity , mortality , and\neconomic cost to society .\n\n\nPatients with diabetes are at risk of the development of acute\nmetabolic complications such as diabetes ketoacidosis , hyper-glycaemic\nhyperosmolar nonketotic coma , and hypo-glycaemia .\n\n\nThey are also at risk of experiencing chronic complications such as\natherosclerotic diseases , retin-opathy , nephropathy , neuropathy , and foot\nulceration , as well as other general medical conditions unrelated to the\nacute or chronic complications specific to diabetes .\n\n\nIt has been estimated that the annual per capita health care\nexpenditure in the United States in 1997 was four-fold for people with\ndiabetes when compared with the general population.  8  \n\n \n\nThis article reviews the chronic complications of diabetes\nmellitus and considers the scientific basis , clinical care , economic impact\n, and public health implications of these co-morbidities on patients ,\ndoctors , and health care organizations in Asia .   \n\n\nThe glucose hypothesis  \n\n \n\nDiabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterised by\nhyperglycaemia and alterations in fat and protein metabolism , and the\noccurrence of a specific set of chronic complications .\n\n\nThe plasma glucose cut-off levels for diagnosing diabetes mellitus\nrest firmly in their association with diabetes complications such as\nretinopathy.  9 \n\n\nThe tactic recognition of the close relationship between\nhyperglycaemia and chronic complications has le to the  ' glucose hypothesis',\n 10,11  which proposes that hyperglycaemia is directly , or\nindirectly , related to the development or progression , or both , of\ndiabetes complications , including the microvascular conditions of\nretinopathy , nephropathy , and neuropathy.  12 \n\n\nFor macrovascular or atherosclerotic complications of diabetes\nmellitus , a subanalysis of the Framingham Heart Study cohort has\ndemonstrated a clear dose-response association between glycated hemoglobin\nlevels and the prevalence of cardio-vascular disease.  13 \n\n\nIn addition , recent interventional studies in patients with type 1\n 14  and type 2  15  diabetes mellitus have provided strong\nsupport for the glucose hypothesis .\n\n\nIn the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (  DCCT ) , intensive\ntherapy reduced the development and progression of all complications by\napproximately 50%.  14 \n\n\nThis uniform salutary effect or retinopathy , nephropathy , and\nneuropathy further suggests that hyperglycaemia may play a similar role in\nthe pathogenesis of these complications.  11  \n\n \n\nExactly what the pathogenetic mechanism is and how it works are\nstill unanswered questions .\n\n\nTraditionally , there have been two major putative pathways: the\naldose reductase - sorbitol and the glycation models .\n\n\nResults of animal studies support the former model , but results from\nhuman studies have been less convincing.  16-18 \n\n\nThe efficacy of a potent protein glycation inhibitor was reported in\na diabetic animal model in 1986,  19  but its effectiveness remains\nto be proven in an ongoing human clinical trial .\n\n\nA third pathway by which hyperglycaemia may cause long-term vascular\ncomplications , has recently been described.  20 \n\n\nThis model suggests that the activation of the \u00df  2  -\nisoform of protein kinase C in vascular tissue is a key step in the cascade\nof events through which glucose triggers diabetic complications.  10,20\n \n\n \n\nThe available evidence indicates that chronic hyperglycaemia is a\ncausal link between diabetes mellitus and diabetic complications .\n\n\nHowever , the precise mechanism by which hyperglycaemia may cause\ncomplications in diabetic individuals remains to be clearly defined .\n\n\nData from familial  21  and ethnic  22  clusterings\nof diabetic complications suggest that the susceptibility to\nhyperglycaemia-induced tissue damage may be determined by genetic factors .\n\n\nCandidates genes such as the aldose reductase gene  23-25 \nand fibrinogen gene,  26  which confer susceptibility to\nmicroangiopathic and macroangiopathic complications respectively , have been\nidentified in various sib-pair linkage analyses  26  or case-control\nstudies.  23-26    \n\n\nMicrovascular manifestations  \n\n \n\nDiabetes mellitus is the leading cause of blindness , end-stage\nrenal disease , and non-traumatic amputation in industrialised countries.\n 27,28 \n\n\nThese conditions are the direct end-points of microvascular\ncomplications that are specific to diabetes and which include retinopathy ,\nnephropathy , and neuropathy .\n\n\nThe risks of these conditions developing can be significantly reduced\nby optimising glycaemic control and if they are detected and treated early\nthrough patient education and regular screening.  14,15,28   \n \n\n\nRetinopathy   \n\n \n\nRetinopathy is an important complication of diabetes mellitus in\nthe Asian population .\n\n\nThe prevalence between 1990 and 1996 for patients with newly\ndiagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus has been estimated to be 22% in Hong Kong,\n 29  and a population-based study performed in China in 1986 showed\na prevalence of 31%.  30 \n\n\nRandomised controlled trials such as the DCCT and the United Kingdom\nProspective Diabetes Study (  UKPDS ) have shown conclusively that improving\nglycaemic control can decrease the incidence of diabetic retinopathy. \n14,15 \n\n\nThis concept is also supported by prospective follow-up studies among\nJapanese and Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  31,32 \n\n\nFurthermore , the DCCT also demonstrated that strict glucose control\nretards the progression of background , non-proliferative retinopathy. \n14 \n\n\nThus , primary and secondary prevention of retinopathy can e\neffectively accomplished by intensive glycaemic management and regular\nophthalmological screening.  14,15  \n\n \n\nProliferative retinopathy and macular oedema are late\ncomplications in the continuum of diabetic retinal disease .\n\n\nResearch on tertiary prevention has shown that these conditions can\nbe treated using laser therapy , which reduces significantly the incidence of\nsevere visual loss and blindness.  33 \n\n\nDespite these findings , only 35% to 60% of American diabetic people\ncurrently undergo annual opthalmological screening.  34 \n\n\nThere is no corresponding estimate for Asian countries , where the\nrate is conceivably even lower due to the long latent phase of retinopathy ,\na lack of health promotion activities , and scarce availability of resources\nand services .\n\n\nIn Hong Kong , a recent cross-sectional study of 629 asymptomatic\ntype 2 patients revealed that 19% and 3% of subjects had non-proliferative\nretinopathy and proliferative changes that required laser treatment ,\nrespectively.  35 \n\n\nThus , it is recommended that all diabetic patients undergo an annual\ndilated fundal examination to screen for diabetic retinopathy.  28,36\n    \n\n\nNephropathy   \n\n \n\nDiabetic nephropathy (  ie comprising microalbuminuria to\nend-stage renal disease ) develops in approximately 35% of patients with type\n1 diabetes mellitus and between 15% and 60% of patients with the type 2\ndisease.  37 \n\n\nIt is the leading cause of chronic renal failure worldwide and is\nresponsible for about one third of patients who undergo dialysis.  38\n\n\n\nOne of the initial markers of this condition is microalbuminuria ,\nwhich indicates an increased risk of progression to nephropathy as well as an\nelevated risk of cardiovascular events.  39 \n\n\nThe natural course of diabetic nephropathy is such that once overt\nnephropathy develops , rental function progressively declines and culminates\nin end-stage renal disease.  40,41 \n\n\nHence , as with retinopathy , optimal glucose preventive measure\nagainst the development of diabetic nephropathy.  14,15  \n\n \n\nIn addition , all diabetic people should be screened for\nproteinuria and microalbuminuria annually.  28,36 \n\n\nThere are various ways of performing urine tests; Table 1 shows the\ndiagnostic criteria for albuminuria.  42 \n\n\nMeasuring the random , spot albumin to creatinine ratio is a simple\ntechnique that can be used as a screening test.  28 \n\n\nBecause of significant variations in urine albumin excretion ,\nhowever , it is recommended that if the results of the first test are\npositive for albumin , the test be repeated for confirmation .\n\n\nIf the second test gives negative results , a third test should be\nperformed .\n\n\nTwo of the three tests should given positive results and other\npotential aetiologies should be excluded before the presence of\nmicroalbuminuria can be concluded.  28,42 \n\n\nIf albuminuria is diagnosed , treatment with an\nangiotensin-converting enzyme (  ACE ) inhibitor should be considered .\n\n\nThis treatment can reduce albuminuria and delay or possibly halt the\nprogression to nephropathy , independent of its blood pressure - lowering\neffect.  43 \n\n\nAggressive blood pressure control is also of vital importance in\npreventing progression of declining renal function .\n\n\nMaintaining the blood pressure is the only modality that has\nconsistently been shown to be effective in halting progression to overt\nnephropathy and renal failure.  44 \n\n\nAlthough absolute target blood pressure levels for patients with\ndiabetic nephropathy have not been well delineated , there is a clear\nassociation between blood pressure and the rate of progression of diabetic\nrenal disease , in both Caucasian and Chinese populations.  44,45 \n\n\n \n\nThere has recently been a renewed interest in the pathogenetic\nrole of hyperlipidaemia in diabetic nephropathy.  46 \n\n\nResults from a prospective trial performed in Hong Kong have shown\nthat effective normalisation of hypercholesterolaemia might retard the\nprogression of nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  47\n\n\n\nThe full potential of lipid-lowering therapy remains to be\nestablished by longer-term studies with a larger sample of individuals . \n  \n\n\nNeuropathy   \n\n \n\nDiabetic patients have an increased risk of the development of\nneuropathy .\n\n\nFoot ulcers may develop , mainly because of the abnormal distribution\nof pressure owing to peripheral neuropathy .\n\n\nA study in the United States showed that one half of a group f\npatients who had had type 2 diabetes mellitus for more than 15 years also had\ndiabetic neuropathy.  27 \n\n\nEven among newly diagnosed case of type 2 diabetes mellitus ,\nretrospective data from Hong Kong suggest a prevalence of neuropathy of\napproximately 13%.  29 \n\n\nAs with retinopathy and neuropathy , a policy of \nstrict glycaemic control reduces the incidence of neuropathy in patients with\neither type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus.  14,15 \n\n\nThe early detection of diabetic neuropathy results in fewer\nhospitalisations of patients with foot ulcers and fewer lower-extremely\namputations.  48 \n\n\nAccording , all diabetic patients should regularly undergo sensory\ntesting and be screened for foot ulceration at regular intervals .\n\n\nIn the absence of clear evidence , consensus expert opinion suggests\nannual sensory examination and opportunistic screening for foot ulceration at\neach clinical encounter.  28,36 \n\n\nEducating patients and increasing physician surveillance regarding\nfoot care and risk factors for amputation have been tested in a randomised\ncontrolled trial and a prospective study .\n\n\nBoth studies reported significant reductions of serious foot\nulceration in the intervention groups.  49,50    \n\n\nMacrovascular manifestations  \n\n \n\nDiabetes mellitus is an independent risk factor for the\ndevelopment of atherosclerosis.  51> \n\n\nOn the other hand , atherosclerotic or macrovascular disease is\nresponsible for more than 50% of all deaths in patients with type 2 diabetes\nmellitus.  27 \n\n\nCardiovascular disease accounts for most case of diabetic\nmacrovascular complications; the remainder are caused by cerebro-vascular\nevents and peripheral vascular disease.  52 \n\n\nThe results from a population-based study suggest that there is a\n10-fold increase in coronary artery disease among Chinese diabetic patient\nwhen compared with the characteristically low rate among non-diabetic\ncontrols.  30  \n\n \n\nWhile hyperglycaemia has been conclusively shown to be the causal\nlink between diabetes mellitus and microvascular complications , its\nassociation with macrovascular manifestations is much more tenuous , as\nreflected by the results of the UKPDS and the DCCT.  14,15 \n\n\nIn the UKPDS , the number of macrovascular events greatly outnumbered\nthat of microvascular complications , but the difference was found to be\nnon-significant .\n\n\nThis result was not wholly unexpected given the multifactorial nature\nof cardiovascular disease .\n\n\nFactors such as hypertension , hyperlipidaemia , and tobacco use\ncontribute to the development of atherosclerosis in diabetic people .\n\n\nHence , hyper-tensive control , lowering lipid levels , and smoking\ncessation are important preventive measures that can help prevent the\ndevelopment of macrovascular diabetic complications.  28,36  \n\n \n\nHypertension develops in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus at\ntwice the rate of those who are non-diabetic.  53 \n\n\nHypertension is a major contributor to atherosclerotic diseases and\ncan lead to a more rapid progression of nephropathy and renal failure. \n54,55 \n\n\nThe UKPDS has a demonstrated that a policy of rigorous blood\npressure control reduces the risk of macrovascular and microvascular\ncomplications in patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus , even more so than\nthe effect of strict glycaemic management.  44 \n\n\nThus , screening and treating hypertensive diabetic patients are\nessential .\n\n\nThere is no clear evidence to support a specified goal in blood\npressure control , although the UKPDS used an upper limit of 150/85 mm Hg as\nits definition of stringent hyper-tensive control.  44  \n\n \n\nElevated serum lipid levels are also a significant risk factor\nin the development of macrovascular diseases in patients with type 2 diabetes\nmellitus .\n\n\nThere are no large randomised controlled trails reported that\nevaluate the effectiveness of giving lipid-lowering treatment to diabetic\npatients who have an abnormal lipid profile and are at risk of heart disease .\n\n\nHowever , small subgroup analyses of two studies of high-risk\ndiabetic individuals have shown that lowering low-density\nlipoprotein-cholesterol levels leads to a \" significant reduction in\ncardiovascular mortality.  56,57 \n\n\nGiven the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease in diabetic\npatients and its associated morbidity and mortality,  27  a\nconservative approach would be to screen for hyperlipidaemia annually and to\ntreat the condition as soon as it is detected . \n\n \n\nIt is well known that tobacco use and diabetes mellitus are\nsynergistic risk factors in the development of cardiovascular disease. \n58 \n\n\nSmoking is also responsible for a whole spectrum of other diseases ,\nwhich include numerous cancers and chronic lung disease .\n\n\nIt follows that all possible measures should be used to prevent\npeople from starting the habit , and to encourage smokers to stop ,\nespecially in the diabetic population.  28,36  \n\n \n\nThe traditionally  ' soft ' cardiovascular risk factors of obesity\nand a sedentary lifestyle may be particularly important in South Asian ( \nIndia , Pakistani , and Bangladeshi ) diabetic patients .\n\n\nObservational studies have demonstrated higher mortality and\nmorbidity rates of cardiovascular disease in overseas migrants of South Asian\ndescent who have diabetes , compared with other ethnic groups.  59 \n\n\nIt has been hypothesized that the high mortality rate is due to\nmetabolic disturbances related to insulin resistance.  59 \n\n\nResults from the United Kingdom have confirmed the existence of\ninsulin resistance syndrome (  glucose intolerance , hyperinsulinaemia ,\nhypertension , low levels of plasma high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ,\nand high levels of triglycerides ) , which is especially prevalent in South\nAsians and which is associated with a pronounced tendency to central obesity.\n 59 \n\n\nThus , the management of obesity preventive measures against\ndiabetes mellitus and coronary arties disease in this vulnerable population .\n  \n\n\nThe economic burden of diabetes mellitus and its complications\n \n\n \n\nDiabetes mellitus is a major and increasing cause of chronic ill\nhealth and premature mortality in almost all Asian countries,  1-7 \nand results in rising cost because of absence form work and health care\nexpenses.  8,60 \n\n\nTo facilitate service planning and to allocate public health\nresources appropriately , there should be reliable estimates and projections\nof the economic costs associated with diabetes mellitus , its complications ,\nand its co-morbidities .\n\n\nThis is especially true in Asian countries where there is a dynamic\n, growing epidemic of diabetes.  1-3  \n\n \n\nThere are two main approaches to investigating the economic\nimpact of diabetes mellitus and its complications .\n\n\nThe first approach uses disability-adjusted life-years (  DALYs ) to\nmeasure the intangible costs associated with the disease , and combines the\nhealthy life-years lost as a result of premature mortality with those lost\ndue to disability or ill health .\n\n\nThis method is valuable , because a substantial portion of health\ncare expenditure is directed towards improving the quality of life and life\nexpectancy in diabetic individuals .\n\n\nThe largest relevant study that has been published so far was\nperformed by the World Bank in 1993.  61 \n\n\nTheir global study investigated the DALYs lost due to various\ndiseases , including diabetes , and estimated that 1362 million DALYs were\nlost worldwide as a result of all illnesses in 1990 .\n\n\nOf these , diabetes mellitus and its complication accounted for 7.97\nmillion DALYs , as shown in Table 2.  61 \n\n\nThe majority of losses were incurred in developing nations (  eg\nChina and India ) .\n\n\nWhen comparing the DALYs lost with per capita health expenditure in\ndifferent countries , the data suggested that the countries in which 80% of\nthe DALYs lost were attributable to diabetes mellitus shared only 13% of the\nworld  ' s health care expenditures.  60 \n\n\nFor example , with an annual per capita expenditure on health care\nof US$21 , the population of India lost 1.9 million DALYs because of diabetes\nmellitus .\n\n\nIn contrast , established market economics such as the Organisation\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development nations , which account for 15% of\nthe world  ' s population and 87% of its health care resources , together lost\nonly 1.3 million DALYs because of diabetes mellitus.  60 \n\n\nIn short , the heavy economic burden of this life-long condition due\nto loss of quality of life and premature mortality is concentrated in those\ncountries with the lowest health care budgets , many of which are in Asia.\n 60,61 \n\n\nDespite some criticisms and caveats about methodological issues ,\nthe World Bank study provides strong support for the need to improve the\nprovision of diabetes health services in Asian countries , particularly in\nthose under-going rapid demographic and economic development.  61 \n\n\n \n\nThe second and most frequently employed technique used to\nevaluate the economic implication of diabetes is the cost-of-illness approach\n, which examines the direct and indirect costs associated with the condition .\n\n\nIn Asia , there has been little systematic effort to conduct\ncomprehensive examinations of the economic consequences of diabetes mellitus .\n\n\nIn the United States , direct medical expenditures attributes to\ndiabetes mellitus in 1997 totalled US$44.2 billion .\n\n\nThe breakdown was as follows: US$7.7 billion because of diabetes and\nacute glycaemic care , US$11.8 billion because of the excess prevalence of\nrelated microvascular and macrovascular complications , and US$24.6 billion\nbecause of the excess prevalence of general medical conditions.  8 \n\n\nOf these direct costs , 62% , 25% , and 13% were related to in-\npatient care , ambulatory services , and long-term care , respectively .\n\n\nTwo third of all medical costs were borne by the elderly (  aged > 65\nyears ) population .\n\n\nAttributable indirect costs totalled US$54.1 billion and comprised\nUS$17.0 billion due to premature mortality and US$37.2 billion due to\ndisability .\n\n\nFurthermore , total medical expenditure incurred by diabetic\npatients was US$10 071 per capita , compared with US$2669 for the\nnon-diabetic population.  8 \n\n\nLikewise , the economic  burden of diabetes mellitus\nin Asia is enormous , anticipated by the prevalence and incidence of the\ndisease and is predicted to increase more in Asia than in the industrialised\nwestern nations in the next few decades.  1-3,60 \n\n\nIt has been estimated that the overall health care costs due to\ndiabetes mellitus in the year 2000 will be doubled when compared with 1990.\n 60    \n\n\nImplications of public health and health care  \n\n \n\nGiven by the very serious clinical and economic ramifications of\nthe diabetes mellitus , it is imperative that doctors , public health\npractitioners , and policy makers vigorously pursue health care strategies\nand medical innovations that can delay the onset and slow the progression of\nthe disease and its complications .\n\n\nOne strategy is to reduce the incidence of diabetes mellitus in Asia .\n\n\nWhile genetic factors have a definite role in the development of the\ndisease , there are also environmental and lifestyle risk factors , such as a\nhigh saturated fat diet , obesity , and lack of physical activity.  1,3\n\n\n\nThese three risk factors are currently recognised as the most\npotentially modifiable .\n\n\nAlthough implementing lifestyle changes , as with any behavioural\nchange , poses a difficult challenge , doing so is essential to improving\npublic health and lessening the impact of the Asian diabetes epidemic . \n\n \n\nA second , complementary strategy is to focus on the primary and\nsecondary prevention of diabetic complications individual who have already\ndeveloped diabetes mellitus .\n\n\nThe DCCT and UKPDS have shown that optimal glycaemic control is the\nmost ideal primary preventive measure against the development of\ncomplications.  14,15 \n\n\nIt is also well known that treating complications such as eye and\nlimb diseases , heart disease , neuropathy , and nephropathy contribute the\nmost of the costs of diabetes care.  62 \n\n\nOnce complications develop , the indirect costs of disability and\npremature mortality increase exponentially; hence , the secondary prevention\nof diabetic complications may be highly effective in reducing the health care\nburden of diabetes mellitus in general.  63 \n\n\nSuch secondary preventive measures include a policy of strict blood\npressure control,  44  institution of ACE inhibition in\nmicroalbuminuric patients,  43  normalization of hyperlipidaemia,\n 47,56,57  smoking cessation,  28,36  and regular screening\nfor all diabetic complications.  28,36  \n\n \n\nA third major component is combating the diabetes epidemic in\nAsia who involves health promotion and patient education .\n\n\nThe reasons are two-fold .\n\n\nFirstly , there are many undiagnosed cases of diabetes mellitus in\nAsia .\n\n\nFor example , the ratio of undiagnosed to diagnosed cases in Vietnam\nand Bangladesh is as high as 4:1.  1,4 \n\n\nThere is thus a serious potential for severe diabetic complications\nto occur because of prolonged undiagnosed hyperglycaemia .\n\n\nSecondly , the clinical presentation of type 2 diabetes mellitus and\nits complications are usually insidious and have a long latent period .\n\n\nAs a consequence , patient compliance with regular follow-up and\nscreening may be poor because the conditions are asymptomatic .\n\n\nPatients therefore need to be adequately informed of the necessity\nand benefits of these clinical interventions .\n\n\nFinancial constraints in some developing Asian economies , however ,\nmay render optimal diabetes care impossible .\n\n\nEven when the services are provided , they may be inadequate or\ninaccessible to patients.  34  \n\n \n\nFinally , increases in both the cost of providing quality\ndiabetes care and the number of people developing the disease have led to a\nsearch for more cost-effective models of care .\n\n\nOne such model is the  ' shared care ' approach , the efficacy of which\nhas been well documented.  64,65 \n\n\nIn this approach , both specialists and primary care doctors\nparticipate in the planned delivery of care; they also exchange information\nover and above routine discharge and referral notes .\n\n\nHallmarks of effective and efficient shared-care schemes include\ncomputerised central recall with prompts for patients and their family\ndoctors , shared records , improved communication between doctors and\npatients , flexible and agreed management plans , the possibility of patients\nmoving up and down the levels of care , and a fail-safe system of coordinated\ncare.  64,65    \n\n\nConclusion  \n\n \n\nThe growing Asian epidemic of diabetes mellitus , and its\nimplications in terms of morbidity , mortality and economic costs of its\ncomplications , calls for urgent attention from clinicians , public health\nofficials , and governments .\n\n\nDoctors should be encouraged to implement primary and secondary\npreventive measures that have been proven to be effective , while community\nhealth workers should actively promote diabetes education to diagnosed\npatients as well as to the general public .\n\n\nFurthermore , government agencies should increase and redirect\nappropriate human and financial resources towards services for the diabetic\npopulation .\n\n\nWhen the demand exceeds the realistic possibility of supplying the\nneeded services , which is the case in many developing countries in Asia ,\nthe limited health care resources must be rationally allocated to programmes\nof proven efficacy.  66 \n\n\nThis is a tough challenge indeed , and the decisions made will\ninfluence the quality of diabetes care in Asia .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM",

reached home at half past four .\n\n\nMy elder sister  ' s black leather shoes were lying on the door-mat .\n\n\nBeside them were Mum  ' s and Dad  ' s slippers .\n\n\n\" Mum , you  ' ve come back at the right time !\n\n\nThe conditioner here has been used up .\n\n\n\n\nPlease bring me a new bottle , coz I  ' ve just wetted my hair .\n\n\nThanks ! &rdquo;\n\n\nMy sister  ' s voice came out from the bathroom .\n\n\nMum usually came back at this hour .\n\n\nI did not correct my sister .\n\n\nIf she thought that I were Mum , she would thank me in a more polite\nmanner .\n\n\nI opened the lowest drawer of the cupboard to fetch the conditioner .\n\n\nThen I shuffled to the door of the bathroom and knocked on it twice\nwith the bottle .\n\n\n\" Come in ! &rdquo;\n\n\nI opened the door and entered .\n\n\nTo my astonishment , in front of me was a girl without clothes or\nunderwear but only with attractive curves .\n\n\nMy elder sister was completely naked !\n\n\nThis was the first time I had seen a naked female body .\n\n\nI only saw one side of it .\n\n\nShining soap bubbles were sliding down her snowy skin .\n\n\nIt was so beautiful that I could not remove my eyes from her .\n\n\nAt first , my elder sister was scared at the sight of me .\n\n\nBut right after she noticed that my goggling eyes were rolling up and\ndown her body in curiosity and silent admiration , her open mouth immediately\ngave way to a triumphant smile .\n\n\n\" Don't look at me like that .\n\n\nGet out ! &rdquo;\n\n\nBut she did not draw the shower curtain or cover her body with her\ntowel .\n\n\nHer words were like an indirect invitation for me to continue gazing\nat her body .\n\n\nMy feet were glued to the floor even though a voice deep in my heart\nkept urging me to stop watching and get out quickly .\n\n\nAt last it was the music of the door-bell that forced me to walk away .\n\n\nI put down the bottle of conditioner , which I had been holding\ntightly in my right hand , closed the door behind me silently and dashed to\nopen the main door .\n\n\nIt was Mum .\n\n\nI explained to her in broken sentences why I was home so early today .\n\n\nThen I went to my desk and opened a text-book .\n\n\nMy head was so full of thoughts that I could hardly finish reading\neven a short paragraph .\n\n\nI used to believe that it was an offence for a male to look at a\nfemale  ' s naked body , except when they were husband and wife or lovers .\n\n\nYet my sister  ' s triumphant smile showed that far from being an\noffence , it was in fact a compliment for the female .\n\n\nSoon after , Mum announced that dinner was ready .\n\n\nLuckily , my elder sister usually sits next to me .\n\n\nIt was convenient to avoid eye contact .\n\n\nI gobbled my food to avoid conversation .\n\n\nFortunately , I usually talk very little at dinner , otherwise , my\nbehaviour might have appeared strange .\n\n\n\" I  ' ll do the dishes tonight, &rdquo; I volunteered .\n\n\nI thought that by keeping my hands

.\n\n\nWhile I can use detergent to wash away the grease from the dishes ,\nwhat should I use to wash away my sister  ' s triumphant smile from my memory ?\n \n\n \n\n\n A HOMELESS IN THE PEARL OF THE ORIENT   \n\n\nWinnie Chow \n\n \n\nThe air was thick and moist , stinking with the fragrance of\ncheap antiseptic liquid soap .\n\n\nHe hated being there because he couldn't stand the smell .\n\n\nBut there was no choice .\n\n\nHis body was cocooned in his own staleness , and a wave of nausea\nswept over him .\n\n\nHe carefully pressed out a bottle cap of stinky liquid hand soap and\nstumbled to the shower cubicle .\n\n\nHe took off his old worn-out clothes and finished showering in four\nminutes .\n\n\nWhile he was washing his only pair of underwear , he studied his face\nin the brown-splattered mirror .\n\n\nStrands of greasy dark long hair fell over his lifeless , clouded\neyes .\n\n\nHis forehead was balding , which made him look older .\n\n\nHe tidied up his oily hair with some tap water , and patted his face\nwith wet hands .\n\n\nThe wrinkles on his forehead and cheeks had deepened , and his skin\nwas no longer supple and bright .\n\n\n\" Is this really me? &rdquo; he murmured , like a desolate\nphilosopher asking silly questions .\n\n\nHe wondered how many faces this filthy , steam-blurred mirror had\nreflected .\n\n\nPeople from all walks of life whom he had never met , and would never\nmeet .\n\n\nThis public bathroom was just another place for the collection of\nindividuals  '  history at the root of society .\n\n\nSometimes he was not sure what

.\n\n\nIn some hidden corner of the Cultural Centre , some comatose bodies\nlay scattered .\n\n\nThe sick , yellow beam flooded from the big sports lights .\n\n\nAcross Victoria Harbour , the blue , red , yellow and green neon\nlights of Central and Wan Chai shimmered , dyeing the thick clouds above in\ndifferent colors .\n\n\nA glamorous view of city , isn't it ?\n\n\nBut some trembling bodies lay hidden , contorted with sleep ,\nalcohol , cigarettes and drugs , hidden where no heavenly light reached .\n\n\nThere lay dried faces with sunken eyes , skeletal hands , yellow\nteeth with stale

couldn't deny that he had to give up his dignity whenever he was hungry .\n\n\n\" This is environmentally friendly ... to save food from being\ndiscarded, &rdquo; he said to himself .\n\n\nIt was

quietly blended into his surroundings again .\n\n\nBoss and MuiMui lay quietly beside him , his only companions all\nthrough the silent night .\n\n\nWhen the clock tower at the Star Ferry Pier struck half past twelve\n, all the yellow sports lights were switched off .\n\n\nOnly the ground lights beside the little palm trees threw up a kind\nof blurred white beam .\n\n\nIt was time to rest , to

he said . \n\n \n\nThe low price -; sometimes as low as US&dollar;10 -; of a\nfake Tag Heuer watch was an attraction , he added , as was their improving\nquality . \n\n \n\nThe company was using advertising to try to turn consumer opinion\nin favour of genuine watches , said Mr Imboden . \n\n \n\nBut the most important thing was to track down producers . \n\n \n\nCounterfeiters were widespread in Thailand as regulations against\nthem were not properly implemented , said Mr Imboden . \n\n \n\nHowever , Mr Imboden thought that on the mainland , Tag Heuer\nwould not encounter a serious problem with counterfeits immediately because\nits name had to be established in the country before imitators would be\ninterested . \n\n \n\nMeanwhile , Hongkong Seibu watch salesman Samuel Tsang Kwok-kit\nsaid political factors had hit sales . \n\n \n\n\" Watch sales have been slightly dragged down by the\nSino-British row, &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\n\" And the influence of the Tiananmen Square crackdown still\nlingers .\n\n\nAlthough sales have been fast recovering in recent years , they are\nstill a bit lower than during the heyday before 1989 . &rdquo;

a Giordano spokesman said yesterday . \n\n \n\nSources said the Foreign Trade and Economic Commission had\nordered its Guangdong branch to tighten scrutiny of the Giordano outlets in\nthe province . \n\n \n\nAnalysts attributed Beijing  ' s move to a recent article in Mr Lai  ' s\n Next Magazine  , which is believed to have upset the mainland\nGovernment .\n\n\nThe controversial magazine has 200 staff and a circulation of 180,000 .\n\n\n \n\nMr Lai started  Next Magazine  , an outspoken weekly ,\nin 1991 , two years after the Tiananmen Square bloodbath .\n\n\nHis decision was triggered partly by his disapproval of the military\ncrackdown on the democratic movement . \n\n \n\nThe critical piece , written by Mr Lai , appeared in an edition\nof the weekly last month . \n\n \n\nIn the article , in the form of an open letter to Chinese Premier\nLi Peng , Mr Lai condemned the mainland official , who played a key role in\nthe Beijing massacre , using abusive language . \n\n \n\n\" A public letter to   wong bak dan \n ( a rude expression meaning a stupid and bad person ) Li\nPeng, &rdquo;

\n\n \n\nMr Yuen confirmed the company co-operated with the police . \n\n \n\n\" They were quite polite .\n\n\nThe research was professionally handled .\n\n\nI don't have complaints, &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\nMr Yuen found himself named as a key figure in a controversy\ninvolving an alleged takeover of National Mutual earlier in the year . \n\n \n\nAt the time , his company was named along with Top Glory as being\ninterested in encouraging National Mutual agents to join a new insurance\nventure . \n\n \n\nSome Top Glory employees , previously employed by National Mutual\n, also had their offices and homes raided by police last week , although no\ndocuments were taken . \n\n \n\nMr Yuen said the CCB , when it searched his office and home , did\nnot explain to him what he was suspected of committing : \" The search\nwarrant just said they needed information in relation to a takeover plan on\nNational Mutual . &rdquo;

said Chen Caiying ,\npromotions officer at the Yirong Group , a leading polyester plant in Shengze\n, a bustling township in Suzhou city . \n\n \n\n\" Staff turnover is high -; to retain employees , the\ngroup has been raising wages and signing contracts with technicians . &rdquo;\n\n\n \n\nChen Yongming , office director Shengze Printing and Dyeing Mill\n, also a leading Shengze polyester plant , said that job-hopping was common\nin the polyester industry in the township . \n\n \n\n\" Some employees previously at state enterprises have\njoined us as we offer better pay , for instance, &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\nStrong rivalry exists between the two companies , but Shengze\nPrinting appears to be more aggressive in the cut-throat quest for talent .\n\n\n \n\nIt uses the obvious weapon of high pay incentives .\n\n\nWorkers at the enterprise earn an average annual salary of 10,000\nyuan ( about HK&dollar;89,690 ) , against 8,000 yuan at Yirong .\n\n\n \n\n\" Our wages bill has grown fast , with last year  ' s\naverage being 8,000 yuan , compared with the average in the township of 3,000\nyuan, &rdquo; Mr Chen said . \n\n \n\n\" An engineer here earns about 700 yuan a month , with an\nadditional annual bonus of about 2,000 yuan . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nApart from high wages , Shengze Printing also offers fringe\nbenefits and training in a bid to lure and retain quality staff . \n\n \n\n\" Every newly recruited employee of the engineer grade or\nabove is offered a 200,000 yuan villa instantly , and a 100,000 yuan gratuity\nupon completion of the five-year contract, &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\nLiving quarters were provided for even the lowest-grade\nemployees once they had served more than three years . \n\n \n\nEach unit was at least 645 square feet , compared with the\naverage living area in Suzhou of 537 sq ft per household . \n\n \n\n\" Starting next year , the company will give every staff\nmember a gift every day .\n\n\nIt can be a drink , a banana ... it depends, &rdquo; Mr Chen said .\n\n\n \n\nAlso , managers whose departments had achieved annual profit of\nat least a million yuan and outstanding employees were being sent abroad on\nbusiness trips for two weeks . \n\n \n\n\" In addition , we offer training opportunities , sending\ntechnical staff to colleges across the country, &rdquo; Mr Chen said , adding\nthat there were other welfare and leisure benefits , including a staff\nkaraoke bar -; now becoming a must at mainland enterprises . \n\n \n\n\" Here , for officials above the middle rank , signing off\ntwo hours later than the knock-off time is the rule instead of the exception .\n&rdquo; \n\n \n\nAt Yirong , staff work year-round without holidays , except\nduring the summer , they are allowed to take Saturdays off . \n\n \n\nEmployees of Shengze Printing take only two or three days off\nper month . \n\n \n\n\" At this job , I do an extra 50 per cent of work compared\nwith my former job at the township government, &rdquo; Mr Chen said . \n\n \n\nSuzhou claims to be the birthplace of the development of China  ' s\nrural and township enterprises , and Shengze has reportedly become the\nmainland  ' s richest township .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "866ec22e-1411-4949-933d-ed68c8e0bd1d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.021149+00:00"}

But what are the results ? \n\n \n\nGreen groups from Hong Kong recently organised a visit to the\nPearl River Delta and came back very impressed with what they saw .\n\n\nThe number of environmental-protection officers in Guangdong , which\nhas a population 10 times greater than Hong Kong , was more or less the same\nas ours .\n\n\nObviously , our bureaucrats are not doing the right thing . \n\n \n\nRight now , our most important problem is unemployment , and the\nkey to this problem is competitiveness .\n\n\nOver time , free trade causes prices to equalise between trading\ncountries - with this process relentlessly at work , Hong Kong  ' s high-priced\nlabour is being squeezed out of the regional and global markets . \n\n \n\nBut for the four years since the handover , the SAR Government\nhas been stuck in an old paradigm - focusing on the property market .\n\n\nOfficials initially attempted to cool the market , then sought to\nease it into a soft landing , and now they are trying to support it\nartificially .\n\n\nAs a result , the Government has been hijacked by the property\ntycoons . \n\n \n\nThe property market will crash .\n\n\nFighting market forces can only make things worse .\n\n\nProperty prices last year were on a par with 1995; prices this year\nare on a par with 1994 .\n\n\nAt this rate , prices next year will be on a par with 1993 .\n\n\nMany people are holding negatively valued assets - that is , their\nproperty is now worth less than they paid for it .\n\n\nA banking crisis will come in due course , although the Government is\ntrying extra hard to avoid it . \n\n \n\nIf the Government shifts its focus to employment and\ncompetitiveness , a lot of things will have to be done differently .\n\n\nFor example , funding for job training and for fostering small and\nmedium-sized enterprises (  SMEs ) should have a much higher priority .\nIronically , the Government recently launched another SME-assistance scheme\nbut with much less funding .\n\n\nI am a beneficiary of the previous SME-loan programme , and one of\nthe few to have repaid my loan .\n\n\nI can tell you the officials who designed this scheme did not\nunderstand the needs of SMEs or the mentality of bankers , and the whole\nthing was an expensive farce . \n\n \n\nWithout jobs in the market , even the best government retraining\nprogramme will be a waste of money , at least in the short term .\n\n\nAnd the hype will do little but create even more frustration among\nthe unemployed .\n\n\nBy creating expectations without sufficient means to satisfy those\nexpectations , the Government is flirting with trouble .\n\n\nSponsoring SMEs is better than paying out public money or subsidising\nmortgages .\n\n\nIt encourages entrepreneurship , creativity and self-reliance .\n\n\nUltimately , however , we have to improve our competitiveness . \n\n \n\n Lau Nai-keung is a Chinese People  ' s Political Consultative\nConference delegate  \n\n\n\n \n\n\nAssociate degrees are booming - but are they all they promise to be ,\nasks  Linda Yeung   \n\n\n Sub-degree studies: the straitjacket effect  \n\n \n\nA year ago , John Fu Keung was like many Form Seven graduates ,\nunsure about what to do after failing to get into university . \n\n \n\nEventually he enrolled in the community college launched by the\nUniversity of Hong Kong  ' s School of Professional and Continuing Education ( \nSPACE ) , which offers associate degrees . \n\n \n\nIn the past year other universities have decided to offer similar\nprogrammes preparing students to move on to full degree studies .\n\n\nThe number of associate degree (  AD ) places to be offered in\nSeptember will rise to 5,000 . \n\n \n\nThe Open University of Hong Kong and Lingnan University are among\nthe institutions that have joined the fray , bringing to 11 the total number\nof AD course providers .\n\n\nAnnual fees range from &dollar;35,000 up to &dollar;50,000 . \n\n \n\nBut the boom in such courses has not eased John  ' s worries .\n\n\nApart from the uncertainty of being accepted by a university when he\ngraduates next year , he is also wondering whether he is getting value for\nmoney .\n\n\nThe annual tuition fee of &dollar;36,000 he has paid is only a few\nhundred dollars less than regular university fees . \n\n \n\nUnlike \" regular &rdquo; University of Hong Kong students ,\nwho enjoy campus life and culture at the historic Pokfulam site , John has\nclasses at SPACE  ' s learning centre above the Admiralty MTR station .\n\n\nThere he enjoys few of the benefits of student life , with the SPACE\nfacility bereft of students ' clubs and societies . \n\n \n\n\" The college is more like a tutorial school to me .\n\n\nBut we are encouraged to express our views in class and the learning\natmosphere is good , &rdquo; said John , who is studying for an AD in\nbusiness administration .\n\n\nThis was not his first choice , but the narrow range of subjects gave\nhim few options .\n\n\n\" I wanted to study pure science but there are few science\nsubjects available . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nTo him , even the Institute of Vocational Education , which\noffers diplomas for technical courses , offers better value for money .\n\n\n\" Their graduates may have better job prospects due to their\nsubstantial practical training .\n\n\nAlso , I am not sure if I can move on to a university later when I\ngraduate . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe three full-time AD programmes to be introduced by the Open\nUniversity , for example , centre on either business administration or\ninformation technology .\n\n\nAt the Caritas Francis Hsu College , the AD programmes linked to\nstudies at Australian , American or British universities are in accounting ,\ntranslation , computing and company administration . \n\n \n\nClass venues for similar courses also vary , with some , such as\nthose run by Baptist University  ' s College of International Education , being\nheld on campus , and others tucked away in commercial buildings . \n\n \n\nThe reason for the notable differences between degree and\nassociate degree programmes is the absence of major government subsidy .\n\n\nOperating on a self-financing basis , the providers have stuck to\nfinancially viable courses , meaning those perceived to have a strong demand\nfrom employers , and , by assumption , students .  \n\n \n\nAlthough the Government subsidises most of the student costs in\nmainstream university studies , to the tune of &dollar;185,000 per person\neach year , AD course providers have to rely on tuition fees to cover their\nexpenses .\n\n\nThe only form of government assistance is the no-interest short-term\nloans for renting or buying premises . \n\n \n\nPresident of Caritas Francis Hsu College , Liu Ping-cheung , said\ntuition fees covered 85 per cent of the operating costs of their AD\nprogrammes .\n\n\nHe said other non-governmental organisations were interested in but\nprevented from offering AD programmes due to a lack of suitable premises and\ngovernment support .\n\n\nThe common concern about costs is not allayed by the Government  ' s\ndecision to offer AD students grants or means-tested loans with a ceiling of\n&dollar;60,000 , subject to an interest rate equivalent to two per cent off\nthe prime rate plus a 1.5 per cent risk factor . \n\n \n\n\" Students who take loans from the Government will have\naccumulated debts of almost &dollar;100,000 when they graduate , but it is\nunknown whether they will reap the benefits and be accepted by universities\nthen , &rdquo; said Chui Yat-hung , director of Hok Yau Club  ' s student\nguidance centre . \n\n \n\nHe also noted students were deprived of the chance of learning\nwhat really interested them because of the limited range of subjects on offer .\n\n\nThe same view is held by the Open University  ' s vice-president Danny\nWong Shek-nam .\n\n\nHe said the current emphasis on courses with market value could mean\nan associate degree and the onward link to full degree in areas such Chinese\nhistory would not be available . \n\n \n\nRecognising the potential problem , the University Grants\nCommittee is due to study whether there is a need to provide funding for less\nmainstream courses , such as anthropology , currently not offered in any AD\nprogrammes . \n\n \n\nYet most operators do not expect the Government to provide more\nfunding for the new sector , though that appears to undermine the Government  ' s\ntarget of enabling 60 per cent of secondary school leavers access to tertiary\neducation through an expansion in sub-degree programmes .\n\n\nIt seems the Government sees AD courses as catering more to future\nmanpower needs than encouraging university education . \n\n \n\nDuring a press meeting recently when the Government was asked why\nit did not subsidise operators more , Secretary for Education and Manpower\nFanny Law Fan Chiu-fun noted that AD courses should be left to market forces\ninstead of relying on government funding .\n\n\nSo , what AD students may end up getting is a second-rate deal .\n\n\nMost operators are resigned to the fact that the huge budget required\nfor education reforms in the school sector will remain its priority . \n\n \n\n\" It will hurt the interests of Hong Kong if everything has\nto be paid for by the Government .\n\n\nAssociate degree programmes provide students with another chance of\ncontinuing their studies , albeit at a cost , &rdquo; said director of Space\n, Professor Enoch Young .\n\n\nBut he echoed another common view that leaving the sector to volatile\nmarket forces had its drawbacks . \n\n \n\nSubjects relating to science and technology would suffer because\nof the huge amount of money needed for facilities and equipment .\n\n\n\" Our operating costs are high and we have to make sure our\nteaching quality is not compromised , &rdquo; he added .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d4c80e7b-cf41-40b9-b88e-3d6b9733316f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.022740+00:00"}
{"text": "Schoenberg , Berg and Webern  were the\nSecond Viennese School in the twentieth century .\n\n\nTheir main contribution is developed the twelve tones techique in\n1920s to 1930s given the prepared way for serialism after the World Wars .\n\n\nSchoenberg is the creator of twelve tones technique and his students\n- &semi; Berg and Webern further developed it into their own style .\n\n\nIn this essay , I am going to discuss the innovation twelve tone\ntechnique by Schoenberg first , and then mention the development of the\nSchoenberg  ' s style by Berg and Webern . \n \n\nSchoenberg  ' s ( 1874-1951 ) process from the\nchromatic , post-Wagnerian style of his earliest work , through the atonal\nstyle of ` expressionist  '  period , finally innovated the twelve tones\ntechnique in 1923 .\n\n\nThe Theory of twelve tone technique is arranging a series or row which\ncontain twelve tones or pitch classes in  random order ,\nwithin an octave .\n\n\nThe row can use as forming melody , harmony and counterpoint in any\noctave or rhythmic pattern .\n\n\nBeside the original row , it can also arrange into its inversion ,\nretrograde and retrograde inversion .\n\n\nIt is also transposed into any level .\n\n\nSo  there are various possibilities to form a\ncomposition .\n\n\n\n\n\nSchoenberg  ' s work such as Fine Piano Pieces Op.23 ,  Serenade Op.24 , four string Quartets , Piano and violin\nconcertos and Variation for orchestra Op.31 are using the twelve tone\ntechnique .\n\n\nBut sometimes are contrasing the idea of this style and some are\ncompletely used the format .\n\n\nFor example , in Variation for Orchestra Op.31 , the row is  broken into 3 motives in Score 1 .\n\n\nThese motives form the    melody\nor theme in the variation .\n\n\n It is firstly\nannounced by cello .\n\n\nAnd the 3 motives are supported by harmonies in the inverted row up a\nmaj . 6th . ie . Po-4 motif is supported by Io-4 harmony and P5-8 is\nsupported by I5-8 chord and so on .\n\n\nThen the melody is varied in the form of Retrograde Inversion and\nharmony is  supported by Retrograde form .\n\n \n\n The aim of creating\ntwelve-tone series is making a coherent or unity in the form of composition\nwith the twelve pitches in scale .\n\n\nAll the notes are equally important .\n\n\nIt also retain the use of traditional instrument for composition\nrather than the sprench stima in his expressionism .\n\n\nAlso it <unclear   </unc> continue the 12\nnotes in scale for without forming a tonality .\n\n\nOn the other hand ,  tonality lack a unity to form a\npiece .\n\n\nSo  Schoenberg thought that twelve-tone technique is a\ngood style that can dominate the music world over 100 years .\n\n\n( But of course , it is not the real thing ! ) \n \n\nBeside Schoenberg also used traditional or old form .\n\n\nFor example , Variation 2 in Op.31 is an antiphone and Variation 2 is\ncontrapuntal\n\n\na cannon is formed between violin and oboe in inversion .\n\n\nLater it also form a passacaglia .\n\n\nIn Suite for Piano Op.28 , He fitted the piece as Gavotte ,  Munett ,  Gigne and Intermezzo .\n\n\nThey are come from the Banofre Suite form .\n\n\nIn Serenade Op.4 , the row is applied of isorhythm that origin from\nMedieval motet . \n \n\nIn 1904 , Berg and Webern followed this style of Schoenberg and\ndominate  to compose 12-tone music . \n \n\nBerg ( 1883-1935 ) freely used twelve tone\ntechnique and allow it to form tonal element .\n\n\nHis works contain a warm feeling of Romantic style .\n\n\nSuch as violin concerto , Lyric Suite and  two operas:\nWozzeck and Ludu .\n\n\nHe emphasised on the constructional principles of thematic unity .\n\n\nSo thematic material is the main source to develop his composition .\n\n\nThus , his composition  are mostly in large-scale\nlength .\n\n\nFor example , in his violin concerto , the solo violin open in fifth\nintervals at 1-7 bars which is a 4 open strings and sounded as    tuning   the string .\n\n\n( See Score 2 )\n\n\nThen the theme in original 12-tone now is annouced in b.15 in\nsuccession of major and minor 3rd intervals with  few\nwhole-tone at the ends .\n\n\nThat tonal triad also  us  in his\nchord progression and harmony .\n\n\n( See Score 3 ) \n \n\nLike Schoenberg , he adopted the use of classical form .\n\n\nThe 1st movement of violin concerto is a Sonata form .\n\n\nBeside , he  used Austrian and \nGerman element .\n\n\nFor example in the Allegretto tempo of the violin concerto , he use\nViennese Waltz and Austrian folk element .\n\n\nIn the Adagio of the Second movement ,  the ending row\nlink to the harmonization of a Bach  ' s Chorale piece that Bach harmonized the\nhymn .\n\n\nIt is enough in Cantata\n#60\n\n\n \n \n\nHowever , Webern against the use of tonal theme or thematic\nmaterials to form a composition .\n\n\nHe ignored the tonal triadic but  prefer to\nuse unresolved 7th and 9th chords .\n\n\nHis contribution is divided his row into small unity space it with\nrest and then played by different instruments .\n\n\n Therefore , all the pitch are in\nindividual manner and also produce a contrasting or blending timbre in\nspecial sounding effect .\n\n\nHe draw much attention to produce special effect in instruments .\n\n\nFor example pizzicato , arco , harmonies , arco , muting , trendo ,\nforte  against pianissimo &semi; ritardanzo follow with a\ntempo &semi; homophonic against contrapuntal texture &semi; contrasting tempo\nand mood place  different\nsections or movements .\n\n\nThose of the works contain these element are , for instance , Three\nSongs for Soprano , E clarinet and   saxophone \n&semi; Symphony Op.21 &semi; Concerto for nine instruments and so on . \n \n\nAs same as Schoenberg , Webern use much contrapuntal texture ,\ncounterpoint and cannon to develop his tone row .\n\n\nIn Symphony Op.21 , the 2nd half of the tone row is retrogade of the\n1st .\n\n\nAnd the entire retrograde row is  a duplication of\nthe original row .\n\n\n So a mirror image is form between two half of the\nrow .\n\n\n( See Score 4 )\n\n\nThe original row  divided into individual pitch or\n2 to 3 pitches announced by different combination of instruments . \n\n\n\n \n\nFrom the above shceme ,  it is seen\nthat Horn I and Horn II form a cannon in contrary motion .\n\n\nSo as clarinet and bass  clarinet .\n\n\nIn Quartet Op.22 , each pitch contain different dynamic marking .\n\n \n\nThis kind of order systematic  style is highly concentrated the work .\n\n\nSo most of Webern  ' s work are dense and short in duration\n\n\n( His Symphony only last for  c.20 minutes\n) Beside , the  symmetry and stability of\nforming the row is a kind of  classical\nstyle . \n \n\nIn conclusion , Berg and Webern widely \ndeveloped the Schoenberg  ' s twelve tone techniques .\n\n\nThe fore are in the style of Romanticism and the other in classic .\n\n\nThe further extend the possible variety in 12-tone technique which\nlater influence the serialism after 1945 , So the serialism is not  seried in pitch but also duration , intensity , timbre....etc . \n \n\nP.S . All the twelve tone are individual and equal important .\n\n\nThey have no \nrelationship between each other , So Schoenberg avoid using tonal triad .\n\n\nBeside ,  composer had to\nfinish the entire row pitch before start another again .  \n\n\n&obrack &semi; Discuss the development of Twentieth Century British\nOpera &cbrack &semi; \n \n\nThe revival of British Opera in Twentieth Century is a special\nevent to the musical world .\n\n\nSince the central Europe contain a long tradition of operatic music\nfrom 16th century to the end of the Era .\n\n\nBut British Opera are much popular in this century .\n\n\nThe reasons of this   occasion   have the following points . \n\n\ni ) There has no great operatic composer after Purcell and no\none inherited Purcell  ' s treasures throughout the last two decades.\n\n\nii ) Most of the opera are come from outsider .\n\n\nAlthough Handel wrote a lot of operatic work in England , all are in\nthe  Italian style.\n\n\niii ) The unfavourable situation of England made a gap for\ncommunication to the central Europe , so popular music   spread  slowly into England.\n\n\niv ) English is not a international language in that period .\n\n\nMost of the opera are sung in Italian and German , Some in French .\n\n\nBeside , the strong accent and articulation of English word is not\n favourable to the foreign people . \n \n\nHowever , in this century ,  after the industrial\nrevolution and  conqueror  of United Kingdom , \nEnglish language become the international language in the world .\n\n\nMany sophisticated machine build up for \nworld-wide communication .\n\n\nSo British people absorbed many foreign culture . \n\n\nIn the early twentieth century , the pre-renaissance English composer\nsuch as Vaughan William , Bax ,  Holst , \nWalton and Delius...etc .  learned much foreign music\n, with  contrasting  national folk element and rework of old style\nmusic , they develop a national style of music .\n\n\nLater in 1945 , Benjamin Britten   composed \nPeter Grimes which evoked the attention to the whole word .\n\n\n Between 1945-75 , British composer composed over\n150 operas . \n \n\nOf course , the main reason for this rebirth is Britten and his\nfollowers produce a combination of national style , 20th century technique\nand classical  tradition\nelement in his opera .\n\n\nOn the other hand , the central Europe get rid of the  diatonic\n tonality in the form of atonality ,   avant garde\n , sprench-stima in   expressionism  .\n\n\nSince opera is a tonal <unc>  </unc>\nmusic , from the development of major and minor tonality in Monteverdi  ' s\nopera to the late 19th century , opera is tonal , the destroy of tonality in\nthis century can not    maintain  \nthe existence of operatic music .\n\n\nBut British Opera emphasise the point of tonality .\n\n\nTheir opera are tonal , so audience are much more accepted . \n \n\nIn the following paragraph , I will mention \nthe great British operatic composer in this century .\n\n\n Britten and  small touch  to Tippett\nand Maxwell Davies . \n \n\nBritten ( 1913-76 ) became a famous operatic\ncomposer after the performance of Peter Grimes .\n\n\nIndeed , he wrote a lot of different opera .\n\n\nFull-scale opera are Peter Grimes &semi; A mid Summer Marriage\n&semi; Billy Budd &semi; Gloriana and Death in Venice .\n\n\nBecause of the   economy  decline after the\nworld war , many operatic house are fell down , but in 1947 , a English\noperatic group developed , Britten then wrote a few chamber opera such as The\nTurn of Screws , Albert Herring &semi; The little Sweep .\n\n\nHe also wrote church opera .\n\n\nThey are partly worship and partly operatic that intend to performed\nin church .\n\n\nFor example , The Prodigal Son , The Burning of Fiery Furnace and\nCurlew River .\n\n\nHe also wrote ballet , Ballad opera , children opera and television\nopera . \n \n\nBritten  ' s opera contain diversify style which is influence by\nMahler  ' s symphony .\n\n\n The following\npoints contain his diversification in terms of operatic setting &semi; aria ,\nrecitative and   chorus  &semi; harmony &semi;\nstructure &semi; and orchestration . \n \n\n\n1.Operatic Setting \n\n\nBritten adopted English   poem  and literatures\nin his operatic .\n\n\nPeter Grimes is come from George   Crabbe  ' s    poem\n \" The Borough &rdquo; and The Turn of Screw is come from Henry\nJames  '  novella .\n\n\nA mid-Summer night Dream is from  \nShakespeare  ' s  drama . \n \n\n In  all\n opera , Britten wanted to reflect the realistic life of a\nhuman being by the style of Naturalism .\n\n\nIn Peter Grimes , he is a fisherman that  implied individual against the social world .\n\n\n( Just reflected his life , a homosexual behaviour against\nthe social Scandal ) .\n\n\nIn Owen Wingrave ,  the theme is war that\nreflected his hatred of  World War .\n\n\nBut he also use supernatural element in A Midsummer Night Dream and\nThe Turns of Screw which is a  evil  story . \n \n\n\n2.Aria , recitative and chorus   Britten emphasised\nmuch on word and music\n\n\nHe think that word can produce dramatic effect in music .\n\n\nSo his aria &ampersand; recitative present in natural and unnatural\nmanner which follow the human speech .\n\n\nFor example , the prologue is a  monologue\nannounced by Sawaller in speech rhythm .\n\n\nThen Peter Grimes  '  Recitative follow in leap intervals and  irregular rhythm .\n\n\nIn  Act II , after Ellen  ' s  short aria  ,\nshe sing in leap intervals and said to Grimes  \" Shall we not to\ngo to church in Sunday  Mornday  \"  in parlando level .\n( Score 5 )\n\n\nTherefore , his recitative and aria are hard to recognized . \n \n\nBeside the choruses produce a intensity and personality in the\nopera\n\n\nIt also involve the dramatic effect .\n\n\nThis is the different of Britten  ' s opera to classical opera .\n\n\n After the Sea interlude  ' s chorus sing the\nmelody to reflect the activities in fishing port .\n\n\nIn Act II , they tightly sound that guess for the coming tide and at\nthe end of the Act III , they  cry for Peter Grimes time\nand again in order to find his way . \n \n\nAlso , Britten made word painting in the opera as same as\nPurcell . \n \n\nFor example in Act II , Boles drunk a lot and sang  melody in leap intervals and  unturning  sounds .\n\n\nAnd then Grimes follow with his recitative with accented quaver\nemphasis the word \" deep \"\n\n\n( See Score 6 )\n\n\nUsually , Britten use four melodies to develop his thematic  materials , and many melody are come from \nmaterial  such as Sea Interlude . \n \n\n\n3.Harmony \n\n\nBritten  ' s harmony are mainly in diatonic tonality with some\nchromaticism .\n\n\nBeside , he applied  tone-row in The Turn of Screw\n, A Mid Summer Night Dream and Death of Venice .\n\n\nBut he treat it as tonal rather than serial .\n\n\nFor example , The tone row of The Turn of Screw is in Score 7 .\n\n\nThe perfect fifth intervals between pitch form a basis for tonic ,\ndominant and  subdominant  in his opera . \n \n\nIn Peter Grimes , before the coming Act I , Ellen sings in E\nmajor while Peter Grimes sings in A ,\n\n\nthis is the use of bitonality .\n\n\nThen Later , they make a consensus that end in E major . \n \n\n\n4.Structure \n\n\nUnfamiliar to the classical operatic form .\n\n\nThere is no overture in Britten  ' s opera .\n\n\nBut he divided the scene  one  Act by numerous interlude .\n\n\nIn Peter Grimes there are six interludes .\n\n\nFor example the Sea interlude  played in the\nbeginning  and End of Act I .\n\n\n Finally at the end of Act III , it repeat\nagain .\n\n\nSo it make the whole opera in a coherent and unity .\n\n\nIn The Turn of Screw , he used even 16 interludes . \n \n\n\n5.Orchestration \n\n\nMany of Britten  ' s opera  contain 2 groups of\norchestra .\n\n\nIn Peter Grimes , The Sea interlude , violin , clarinet and harp\nplay arpeggio chord implied the sea waves movement &semi; while brass and\ntimpani started warm chord that reflect the warm morning rises .\n\n\nFlute and violin sing melody that represent the flying of seagulls .\n\n\nSo the interlude is also a kind of dramatic effect . \n \n\nIn his chamber opera , he used chamber orchestra and four singer\nto play the operas . \n \n\nThe followers of Britten is Tippett ( 1905-  ) .\n\n\nHis works are few in number than Britten such as A Midsummer\nMarriage , The Knot Garden , The King Priam and The Break .\n\n\nHe wrote his own libretto because he thought that  every element in an opera is the art .\n\n\nSo composer has to stress on each part in detail ( Same\nthough as Wagner ) .\n\n\nHis work are in the style of  ' Allegory and Myth  '  in Symbolism .\n\n\nFor example , in A Midsummer Marriage .\n\n\nthere are two  lovers - &semi;\n\n\nMark and Jennifer stand for the supernatural and a complex love .\n\n\nwhile  Jack and Bella are the natural human being\nand their  love  are straight forward .\n\n\nThis symbolism is come from the \npsychology of Jung in which the visionary side stand for human darkness and\nthe psychological side stand for human in nature .\n\n\nSo the opera present in the light , shadow and wholeness meaning .\n\n \n\nOn contrary , Maxwell Davies  is a modern operatic\ncomposer .\n\n\nHe applied   avant garde   element with old traditional style .\n\n\nBecause of his expressionistic style , most of the dramatic works\nare presented his self feeling .\n\n\nFor example in eight song for the Mad King , the  counter \ntenor use sprench stina to sing in the range of 5 octaves .\n\n\nHe  required the singer sing in chord ,\nharsh and lyric note in contrast .\n\n\nBeside , he used new notation such as  and\nBird Cage Score in\n#3 for improvizational purpose . \n \n\nThe use of parody is dominated in his dramatic work .\n\n\nSuch as he used harpsichord as continuo , percussion purpose and\ncommentary .\n\n\nThe use of messiah in Song 6 &semi; Ragtime rhythm and Scottish folk\nmusic in Song 5 &semi; Use <unc> 1-word </unc> title - &semi;\nAllemande and <unc> 1-word </unc> in Song 7.. . etc are the sources\nof parody  .\n\n\nBeside the vision and gesture of the dramatic attract audience much .\n\n\nEach player is placed in Bird Cage while The Mad King \n wear  in purple splendid clothing teach the    bullfinch  to sing .\n\n\nFor example Fl in #3 , cello in #4 , clarinet in #6 and vln in #7 .\n\n\nfinally the King Mad and broken the Cage . \n \n\nThe conclusion , British opera are become in simple in structure\nbut complex in the technique of tonality ,  melody , text\nand expression method \n \n\nWhile the style has a trend from naturalism through symbolic\ncharacter to expressionism .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "1efb26ca-e557-4bc5-808c-62110bf514d4", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.023889+00:00"}

' \n\n\nI kept asking myself and pretended to be typing on the keyboard . \n\n \n\n'Hey Sherry .\n\n\nIt  ' s eight already .\n\n\nEverybody left except you and me .\n\n\nWhat stuff are you working with ?\n\n\nThe promotion for the fireworks display at Victoria Harbour ?\n\n\nMaggie leaned toward the monitor and tried to figure out the string\nof meaningless alphabets that I typed .\n\n\n'What are you tying ?\n\n\nSome password codes , I guess?'\n\n\nShe teased me playfully. \n\n \n\n'Nothing , I  ' m just thinking of what the bad luck will be .\n\n\nSort of pre-occupied by that, ' I said. \n\n \n\n'You mean the prediction of  The Zodiac Master  ?

' \n\n \n\nLeft in the office were myself and  The Zodiac Master  ,\nwhich lay , lively , on my writing desk. \n\n \n\nNICK liked drinking coffee , black coffee in particular .\n\n\nHe said it kept him sober and wise .\n\n\nHow ridiculous he was , I thought .\n\n\nWhenever he brought me to Pokka Caf\u00e9 , I felt some cells of\nresistance scurrying uneasily in my veins .\n\n\nEvery time we met , whether in Pokka Caf\u00e9 or restaurants , he ordered\ntwo cups of black coffee .\n\n\nOne for him and the other for me .\n\n\nHe seemed to be unaware of my dislike of it. \n\n \n\nWhen I arrived at Pokka Caf\u00e9 , as usual , it was muffled with an\nodor of black coffee .\n\n\nI was almost suffocated by the whiff .\n\n\nNick had arrived , sitting at the tiny table beside the window ,\nwhich overlooked the traffic outside .\n\n\nSomewhere near the crossroads was an accident , in which a car ran\ninto a tram. \n\n \n\nNick seemed overjoyed .\n\n\nI could tell from the triumphant grin that crossed his face and the\nglistening sparkle in his eyes. \n\n \n\n'Darling , you look a wee bit tired. ' Nick kissed me on the\nforehead. \n\n \n\n'I  ' m sort of stressed out with my work.'\n\n\nThe curse of  ' bad luck; was still perturbing me. \n\n \n\nHe waved the waiter and ordered two cups of black coffee without\nasking me what I like to drink .\n\n\nIt had already become a ritual that made him feel masculine .\n\n\nAfter the waiter had gone , he resumed the conversation ,  ' Sweetheart\n, you know what ?\n\n\nI  ' ve been dispatched to work in the headquarters in New York. ' Nick\nannounced it in an elated tone .\n\n\nHe continued ,  ' Can you believe it ?\n\n\nI  ' m the only one who got this secondment! ' \n\n \n\nI was shocked .\n\n\nYet I tried to conceal my astonishment with calmness .\n\n\n'Congratulations .\n\n\nWhen will you go there? ' \n\n \n\n'Next month , the manager said. ' \n\n \n\n'How long will it take? ' \n\n \n\n'Not sure .\n\n\nProbably eight years. ' \n\n \n\nEight years ?\n\n\nIt  ' s an incredibly long time .\n\n\nHow could that happen ?\n\n\nIs that what  The Zodiac Master  called the  ' bad luck'? \n\n \n\n'You didn't turn down the offer , did you?

' \n\n \n\nThe smell of black coffee drew near .\n\n\nThe waiter , with a tray in his hand , served the black coffees for\nus .\n\n\nI looked at the coffees , whispering in a desperate voice ,  ' Did you\never know I don't like black coffee? ' \n\n \n\nNick looked a bit unsure ,  ' Sorry? ' \n\n \n\n'I said I don't like black coffee. ' \n\n \n\nHe was taken aback ,  ' I - I thought you liked drinking it as I\ndo .\n\n\nI thought - I thought you enjoyed drinking it whenever you were with\nme. ' \n\n \n\n'No .\n\n\nI don't .\n\n\nIt  ' s you who like drinking black coffee .\n\n\nIt  ' s you who ordered black coffee for me .\n\n\nI  ' m forced to drink it , no matter how bitter it tastes.

' \n\n \n\n'You can go to New York with me .\n\n\nDon't worry .\n\n\nEverything will be fine, ' he assured me. \n\n \n\n'You don't understand what I said.'\n\n\nI got sullen. \n\n \n\nNick looked down , without saying anything .\n\n\nBoth of us were kept in the deadlock of silence .\n\n\nWhat am I doing now ?\n\n\nAm I rebelling against him ?\n\n\nAm I trying to overturn him ?\n\n\nI kept interrogating myself. \n\n \n\nWhen I got up , he tried to kiss me but I withdrew .\n\n\nEventually , I left Pokka Caf\u00e9 , without saying a word to him  .\n\n \n\nWHEN I got home , I was surrounded by intense darkness .\n\n\nI turned on the light , and saw that my father was on the balcony .\n\n\nI walked near him and called to him in a soft voice ,  ' Dad! ' \n\n \n\n'Sherry .\n\n\nLook !\n\n\nLook at that star .\n\n\nThe most sparkling one above us.'\n\n\nMy father was excited , pointing to the starry sky. \n\n \n\nI looked up to the sky .\n\n\nThousands of stars were glittering , as if many eyes were watching\nus .\n\n\nFollowing my father  ' s direction , I discovered the star , the one\nwhich was the most outstanding for its extra large size and shine. \n\n \n\n'It must be the soul of your mother .\n\n\nShe must be sent to guide us..., ' my father muttered. \n\n \n\nDad must be very lonely after Mom died a year ago .\n\n\nHe kept thinking about her .\n\n\nEven now , he woke up early in the morning , sitting beside the\ntable , as it waiting for the breakfast that Mom used to prepare for us over\nthe years. \n\n \n\n'Dad, ' I drew near him .\n\n\nBut I could not say anything. \n\n \n\nHe put his hand over my shoulder ,  ' Silly child .\n\n\nWe human beings are very stupid .\n\n\nWe  ' re always preoccupied with some trifling matters , which are not\nworth mentioning when we die.'\n\n\nHe seemed to have an ability to read my mind since my childhood .\n\n\n'Dad, ' my eyes were welled with tears ,  ' I miss Mom .\n\n\nI do miss her. ' \n\n \n\n'Me too .\n\n\nYour mom was such a determined person who influenced people around\nher .\n\n\nDo you still remember Brownie? ' \n\n \n\n'Brownie ?\n\n\nA flash of memory seemed to revive in my brain .\n\n\nI could not tell what exactly it was. ' \n\n \n\n'Haha, ' my father gave a little laugh ,  ' you were too small to\nremember that , I bet .\n\n\nThat year , you were around seven years old .\n\n\nYour art teacher asked the whole class to stitch a teddy bear with\nthe brown cloth and cotton distributed in class .\n\n\nArmed with the materials back home , you scattered the cloth and\ncotton on the table and didn't get started .\n\n\nYour mom sensed something happening and asked , \" My little\nSherry , aren't you supposed to stitch a bear ?\n\n\nWhy don't you get started ? &rdquo; Your mom was a woman of a caring\nheart .\n\n\nCertainly her gentle concern moved you .\n\n\nYou replied , explaining that you thought it better to make a rabbit\ninstead of a bear .\n\n\nBut you said this would go against the teacher  ' s instruction and\ndidn't dare enough to do so .\n\n\nDo you still remember what your mom said to you ?\n\n\n\" Just follow your will .\n\n\nThere  ' s not much difference between making a bear and a rabbit , as\nlong as you feel comfortable . &rdquo; Eventually you made a rabbit .\n\n\nBrown rabbits are rare .\n\n\nAnd you named your masterpiece Brownie .\n\n\nThough Brownie didn't receive any praise from your art teacher , as\nshe questioned you why didn't you follow her instructions , you were happy\nwith it because you made it out of your consciousness. '  Well done ,\nSherry .\n\n\nSee the little rabbit you stitched .\n\n\nHow cute it is .\n\n\nLet  ' s give it a name - how about Brownie ?\n\n\nDoesn't that suit this little creature ?\n\n\nMy mother was just standing beside me , stroking my hair with her\nsoft hand .\n\n\n'Your mom was used to being that decisive .\n\n\nShe seemed not to take people  ' s advice .\n\n\nEven I was no exception .\n\n\nSomebody said she was wilful.'\n\n \n\n\nDo whatever you think is good .\n\n\nNo matter what people say , follow your consciousness as long as you\nfeel comfortable.  \n\n \n\nI walked to my bedroom and sat beside the dressing table .\n\n\nLooking at the mirror , I saw my reflection .\n\n\nI did not know myself completely , though I kept exploring the kind\nof person I had been during the past years .\n\n\nWith a soft knock on the door , my father came in with a brown\naffair in his hand .\n\n\nHe sat beside me and handed it to me .\n\n\nIt was Brownie. \n\n \n\n'Your mother kept it in her drawer for so many years .\n\n\nShe told me on her dying bed , \" Whenever Sherry is perplexed\n, go and give Brownie to her .\n\n\nShe will know what to do with it.\"'\n\n\nFrom his satisfied look , I knew my father was remembering my mother\nagain .\n\n\nIt seemed to me that he had swallowed all her words and kept them in\na safe. \n\n \n\n'Why did she withhold it for such a long time? ' I asked. \n\n \n\n'When she was alive , she was your brownie .\n\n\nShe could give you advice whenever you felt confused .\n\n\nBut she knew that she would pass away someday , so she kept it ,\nhoping it would guide you when she was no longer around .\n\n\nAnd now , I give it to you .\n\n\nI  ' m sure it  ' s already inhaled your mother  ' s spirit. ' \n\n \n\nI held Brownie in my hand .\n\n\nStroking its worn-out surface , I sensed my mother  ' s\nself-determination. \n\n \n\n'SHERRY , I  ' m sorry for my gaffe at Pokka Caf\u00e9 - I  ' m really\nsorry for my mistake .\n\n\nI was terrible .\n\n\nWhy don't you answer my call ?\n\n\nI miss you very much , darling .\n\n\nI  ' m going to take the morning flight to New York tomorrow .\n\n\nNine o'clock in the morning .\n\n\nHope to see you at the airport .\n\n\nGo with me , please .\n\n\nI want to be with you .\n\n\nPlease forgive me.'\n\n\nI listened to the recorded snippet again and again , and could not\ndecide what I should do. \n\n \n\nI could hear Nick imploring me .\n\n\nBut how about my father ?\n\n\nThe up-coming promotion ?\n\n\nI could not decide. \n\n \n\nThe next morning , I woke up with Brownie on my side .\n\n\nIt was seven .\n\n\nI took the early ride to the airport .\n\n\nWhen I arrived the airport was already thronged with people .\n\n\n'Sherry!

{"text": "Diagnosing diabetes mellitus in the Asian population   \n\n\nGTC Ko \n\n \n\n\nWestern guidelines have been used to diagnose diabetes mellitus in\nAsia .\n\n\nThe increased availability of data from Asian populations , however ,\nhas made it apparent that modifications to western guidelines are needed when\nthey are used in Asia .\n\n\nBoth the American Diabetes Association and the World Health\nOrganization have recently modified their diagnostic criteria for diabetes\nmellitus .\n\n\nThe implications of these new criteria in Asia are discussed in this\npaper .\n\n\nThe significance of using fasting plasma glucose measurements and/or\noral glucose tolerance tests in the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is\nanalysed .\n\n\nA simple approach to diagnose diabetes mellitus in the Hong Kong\nChinese population is also suggested .    \n\n\nIntroduction  \n\n \n\nDiabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous metabolic syndrome that is\ncharacterised by chronic hyperglycaemia due to insulin resistance , insulin\ninsufficiency , or both .\n\n\nWith a better understanding of the pathophysiology and regulation of\nglucose metabolism , new classifications of diabetes based on aetiologies ( \nBox 1 ) and clinical staging (  Fig ) have been recommended by the World Health\nOrganization (  WHO ) and the American Diabetes Association (  ADA).  1,2\n\n\n\nIn particular , the previous classification of insulin-dependent\ndiabetes mellitus and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus have now been\nreplaced by type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus , respectively , because of\nthe considerable overlap in the clinical stages between the two types of\ndiabetes .\n\n\nIn clinical practice , the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus remains\nlargely a clinical one and relies mainly on the measurement of plasma glucose\n( PG ) levels with or without the presence of hyperglycaemic symptoms . \n \n\n\nThe gold standard  \n\n \n\nIn 1985 , the WHO recommended the use of either a fasting PG\nconcentration of = 7.8 mmol/L (  140 mg/dL ) and/or a 2-hour post-glucose\nloading PG (  or random PG ) concentration of = 11.1 mmol/L (  200 mg/dL ) as\ndiagnostic criteria.  3 \n\n\nIn asymptomatic subjects , the test is repeated to confirm the\ndiagnosis .\n\n\nUp to 1996 , the ADA adopted similar diagnostic criteria.  4\n  \n\n \n\nThe 2-hour PG cut-off value of 11.1 mmol/L remains the gold\nstandard because of its pathophysiological significance .\n\n\nIn prospective studies , diabetes retino-pathy was found in patients\nwhose 2-hour PG level was = 11.1 mmol/L.  5,6 \n\n\nThere is also evidence that 11.1 mmol/L is the 2-hour PG level at\nwhich insulin secretion from pancreatic \u00df cells starts to decline.  7,8\n\n\n\nOn the other hand , the fasting PG cut-off value of \n7.8 mmol/L has been more arbitrarily defined .\n\n\nThe threshold was based mainly on the finding that more than\n90% of subjects who had a fasting PG level of = 7.8 mmol/L would be\nclassified as having diabetes mellitus according to the 2-hour PG level if a\nsubsequent oral glucose tolerance test (  OGTT ) were performed.  9 \n\n\nHowever , subjects who have a fasting PG level of\n<7.8 mmol/L would not necessarily  have a 2-hour PG level of <11.1 mmol/L .  \n\n\nIn fact , there is now abundant evidence that confirms the poor\nsensitivity of using a fasting PG cut-off value of 7.8 mmol/L to diagnose\ndiabetes , as based on a 2-hout PG cut-off value of 11.1 mmol/L.  10,11\n\n\n\nTo achieve an optimal balance between the sensitivity and specificity\nof this method of diagnosing diabetes , a lower fasting PG value , ranging\nfrom 5.3 to 7.1 mmol/L , has been suggested for use in different ethnic\ngroups.  12-14 \n\n\nIn the Hong Kong Chinese population , the fasting PG cut-off value\nthat corresponds to a 2-hour PG level of 11.1 mmol/L is between 5.5 and 5.8\nmmol/L.  15,16    \n\n\nNew diagnostic criteria  \n\n \n\nIn 1997 , the ADA modified their diagnostic criteria by reducing\nthe fasting PG cut-off value from 7.8 to 7.0 mmol/L (  126 mg/dL ) , while\nkeeping the 2-hour (  or random ) PG cut-off value the same (  ie 11.1 mmol/L).\n 1 \n\n\nThe diagnosis needs to be confirmed by repeating the test on a\ndifferent day; however , the OGTT is discouraging for routine clinical use .\n\n\nIn epidemiological studies , one fasting PG measurement will suffice.\n 1 \n\n\nIn 1988 , the WHO proposed similar modifications to the diagnostic\ncut-off levels.  2 \n\n\nThe WHO reserved the use of fasting PG or 2-hour PG measurements for\nepidemiological purposes and suggested that ideally , both values should be\nused .\n\n\nThe revised criteria are summarized in Table 1 .   \n\n\nNew intermediate group  \n\n \n\nThe fasting PG cut-off level of 7.0 mmol/L was chosen because of\nits strong association with the  development of retinopathy ,\ncoronary artery disease , and its correspondence to a 2-hour PG measurement\nof 11.1 mmol/L.  1 \n\n\nThe PG level , however , should be viewed as a continuum regarding\nits relationships with cardiovascular risks .\n\n\nIn non-diabetes Hong Kong Chinese subjects (  based on the 1985 WHO\ndiagnostic criteria of a fasting PG , <7.8 mmol/L and a 2-year PG ,  \n<11.1 mmol/L ) , we have previously found  that subjects with a fasting PG\nlevel of 5.7 to 7.8 mmol/L , when compared with those with a fasting PG level\nof less than 5.7 mmol/L , have significantly higher systolic blood pressure ,\nbody mass indices , waist to hip ratios , glycated haemoglobin (  HbA  1c\n  ) levels , insulin levels , and adverse lipid profiles.  16 \n\n\nSimilarly , in Chinese people with normal glucose tolerance (  based\non the 1985 WHO criteria of both fasting PG and a 2-hour PG ,\n<7.8 mmol/L ) , increasing HbA   1c  tertiles have been shown to be\nassociated with increasing blood pressure , waist to hip ratios , PG ,\ninsulin levels , and adverse lipid profiles.  17  \n\n \n\nThree major population-based studies have shown that there is a\nclear relationship between the degree of glycaemia and the mortality rate ,\neven among subjects with normal glucose tolerance , as analysed by tertiles\nor quartiles of fasting blood glucose.  18-20 \n\n\nIn accordance with the idea that the relationship between the PG and\nincreased morbidity and morality is continuous , both the ADA and WHO have\nsuggested a new intermediate group based on the fasting PG level.  1,2\n\n\n\nPeople who have a fasting PG level of 6.1 to 7.0 mmol/L (  110-126\nmg/dL ) are considered to have impaired fasting glucose (  IFG ) by the ADA or\nimpaired fasting glycaemia by the WHO .\n\n\nIn contrast , people whose fasting PG level is\n<6.1 mmol/L  are considered to have norma l fasting glucose (  NFG ) (  Table 1 ) .\n  \n\n\nOral glucose tolerance tests  \n\n \n\nThe OGTT is usually performed for those who have borderline PG\nlevels (  either fasting or random ) .\n\n\nIt has also been suggested as the screening test for high-risk\nsubjects such as those with impaired glucose tolerance (  UGT ) , a family\nhistory of diabetes , obesity , or hypertension.  21 \n\n\nHowever , the OGTT has long been criticized because of its\ninconvenience to patients , high costs , and poor reproducibility.  22\n\n\n\nIn Hong Kong Chinese patients , we have previously found that the\nreproducibility of the OGTT is only 66%.  23 \n\n\nThis result did not improve even among subjects with risk factors for\nglucose intolerance such as those having a high level of HbA  1c  or\nobesity .\n\n\nThe ADA has discouraged the use of the OGTT in its revised diagnostic\ncriteria.  1 \n\n\nIf the OGTT is indicated , however , the previous 2-hour PG cut-off\nlevels are still applicable , such that subjects with a fasting PG level of\n<0.7 mmol/L and a 2-hour PG level of 7.8  to 11.1 mmol/L are considered to\nhave IGT.  1,2    \n\n\nThe implications of using the new diagnostic criteria in the Asian\npopulation  \n\n \n\nIn 1993 , Cockram et al  24  reported the crude\nprevalence of diabetes mellitus in the Hong Kong Chinese population to be\n4.6% , based on a survey of 1513 adults of working ages .\n\n\nOf the cases of diabetes mellitus , 61.8% had been\nundiagnosed previously .\n\n\nAfter excluding known cases , the prevalence of diabetes mellitus was\ncalculated to be 2.83% , using the 1985 WHO criteria.  25 \n\n\nIf the 1997 ADA criteria (  fasting PG , = 7.0 mmol/L; no 2-hour PG\nmeasurement ) were applied to the same group of adults , the prevalence of\ndiabetes was calculated to be 1.41%: a net reduction of\n1.42%.  25 \n\n\nThis difference was accounted for by the  ' loss ' of 1.95% of\npeople with a fasting PG level of <7.0 mmol/L , but with a 2-hour  PG level\nof = 11.1 mmol/L .\n\n\nHowever , the loss was partially compensated by an increase of\n0.54% of people whose fasting PG level was 7 to 7.8 mmol/L and 2-hour\nPG was less than 11.1 mmol/L .\n\n\nThis group had diabetes mellitus according to the new criteria but\nnot the old ones.  25 \n\n\nIf the 2-hour PG measurement were also taken into account (  using the\n1998 WHO criteria ) , the  ' new ' prevalence of diabetes would then be\n3.37%: a net increase of 0.54% .\n\n\nSimilarly , in Japan , the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus of\n13.3% consists of only 7.8% of people in whom the disease was\ndiagnosed , based on a fasting PG cut-off level of = 7.0 mmol/L .\n\n\nThe remaining 5.5% of subjects has a fasting PG level of\n<7.0 mmol/L and the diagnosis was based o n the 2-hour PG level = 11.1 mmol/L\n( Sasaki A , unpublished data , 1999 ) . \n\n \n\nA reanalysis of European epidemiological data from 26 190\nsubjects showed that the difference in prevalence of diabetes mellitus using\nthe ADA criteria (  fasting PG , = 7 mmol/L ) and WHO criteria (  2-hour PG , =\n11.1 mmol/L ) ranged from -4.0% to +13.2% and that the\noverall difference was +0.5%.  26 \n\n\nOnly 28% of the 1517 diabetes patients were classified as\nhaving diabetes mellitus according to both criteria .\n\n\nInterestingly , the WHO and ADA criteria were more likely to diagnose\ndiabetes in lean individuals , and middle-aged obese individuals ,\nrespectively.  26  \n\n \n\nDespite its low sensitivity of diagnosing diabetes mellitus ,\nusing a fasting PG measurement is a more reproducible test when used in the\nHong Kong Chinese population .\n\n\nBased on the measurements of the fasting PG level on two occasions\nwithin 6 weeks , the diagnoses (  diabetes , IFG , or NFG ) were highly\nconsistent , with an overall reproducibility of 90.8%.  25 \n\n\nIn addition , patients who were classified as having diabetes\nmellitus according to the new criteria had higher HbA  1c  and\nfructosamine levels than did diabetic patients whose disease was diagnosed by\nusing the old criteria.  25    \n\n\nMissed glucose intolerance  \n\n \n\nBased on the available epidemiological data , it is essential to\nreduce the fasting PG cut-off value .\n\n\nUsing the fasting PG level alone to diagnose diabetes mellitus is\nmore convenient and the result is more reproducible .\n\n\nThe omission of the 2-hour PG measurement , however , will fail to\nidentity subjects who would have glucose , intolerance (  ie IGT ) or diabetes\nmellitus as defined by the 2-hour PG measurement .\n\n\nFurthermore , if the OGTT is subsequently performed in individuals\nwho have a fasting PG level below 7.0 mmol/L , a proportion of them will be\nfound to have IGT or diabetes mellitus .\n\n\nThis group is referred to as having  ' missed glucose intolerance ' ( \nMGI ) . \n\n \n\nIn a previous survey , 10% to 30% of 1513 Hong\nKong Chinese individuals were found to have MGI (  ie a normal fasting PG but\nan abnormal 2-hour PG ) depending on the presence or absence of risk factors\nfor glucose intolerance (  unpublished data , 1999 ) .\n\n\nThe diagnosis of IGT cannot be made without performing an OGTT .\n\n\nStudies have confirmed the adverse relationship between IGT and\ncardiovascular disease.  27 \n\n\nIn addition , we have previously shown that 11.5% of cases of\nIGT progress to diabetes mellitus each year in the Hong Kong Chinese\npopulation.  28 \n\n\nThis conversion rate is one of the highest reported among different\nethnic populations and is lower than the rate of 15.7% per year\nreported by Pan et al in the Da Qing Study , which involved the Chinese\npopulation in northern China.  29  \n\n \n\nTo minimise missing the diagnosis of diabetes or IGT , we have\nattempted to identify the characteristics of individuals with MGI .\n\n\nIn a local study of Chinese individuals with no history of diabetes,\n 25  OGTTs were performed in those with IFG and those with risk\nfactors for glucose intolerance such as hypertension and obesity .\n\n\nIn this way , more than half of those tested were found to have MGI.\n 25 \n\n\nHence , if the OGTT were performed in high-risk individuals ( \napproximately 20% of the population ) , approximately 70% of\nthe MGI cases would be identified (  unpublished data , 1999 ) .  \n\n\n\nGuidelines for diagnosing and classifying glucose intolerance in Asia\n \n\n \n\nThe Japanese Diabetes Association (  JDA ) has recently recommended\na set of criteria to definite glucose intolerance and to diagnose diabetes\nmellitus (  Box 2).  30 \n\n\nMost of the recommendations from the JDA are applicable to Hong Kong .\n\n\nHowever , using an optimal HbA  1c  cut-off level to screen\nor diagnose diabetes is still controversial and the measurement of the HbA\n 1c  level in Hong Kong has not been standardised .\n\n\nOn the other hand , the creation of additional terms such as  ' borderline'\nglucose intolerance may create further confusion , because this group\nincludes subjects with IFG and/or IGT . \n\n \n\nRecently , the Asian-Pacific Type 2 Diabetes Group recommended\nthe use of the new WHO and ADA diagnostic criteria to diagnose diabetes\nmellitus and emphasised that a casual glucose measurement cannot be used to\ndiagnose IGT or IFG.  31 \n\n\nThe diagnosis of diabetes should always be confirmed by repeating the\ntest on another day , unless there is unequivocal hyperglycaemia with acute\nmetabolic decompensation or other obvious symptoms .\n\n\nTo reduce the number of cases of missed diagnosis owing to the\nomission of 2-hour PG measurements , performing an OGTT is recommended for\npeople who have high normal fasting or random glucose levels .\n\n\nThese values are arbitrarily taken as a fasting PG level of 5.6 to\n6.9 mmol/L or a random PG level of 6.5 to 11.0 mmol/L.  31   \n\n\n\nGlycated haemoglobin levels  \n\n \n\nIn the Hong Kong Chinese population , using paired values of the\nfasting PG level and HbA  1c  , level allows  the\nidentification of people in whom diabetes mellitus has a high likelihood of\ndeveloping.  32-34 \n\n\nThe likelihood ratio of having diabetes in people whose fasting PG\nlevel is = 5.6 mmol/L and HbA  1c  level is = 5.5% has been\nshown to be 5.36 , compared with a value of only 0.10 in people with a\nfasting PG level of <5.6  mmol/L and HbA   1c  level of\n<5.5%.   32 \n\n\nIf these paired values were increased to 6.1 mmol/L and 6.1%\n, the likelihood ratio of having diabetes increases further , to 17.2. \n33 \n\n\nIf fasting PG and HbA  measurements are used as initial screening\ntests and if an OGTT is performed only in those with a high likelihood ratio\nto confirm their glycaemic status , more than 80% of OGTT will be\nunnecessary .\n\n\nIn a Japanese study , the HbA  1c  measurement was available\nin 54% of a random sample of 10 865 adults older than 20 years .\n\n\nUsing fasting PG and 2-hour post-glucose loading PG measurements as\nreference tests , 13.6% of men in their 50s and 17.3% of\nwomen in their 60s were considered to have a high likelihood of having\ndiabetes if the HbA  1c  level was 6.1% or higher.  35\n \n\n \n\nAlthough there is enough evidence to support the use of the HbA\n 1c  measurement as an alternative or adjunct investigation to the\nPG measurement , it should be used only as a screening test for diabetes.\n 36 \n\n\nMeasuring the HbA  1c  level is insufficiently sensitive as\na direct substitute for the OGTT .\n\n\nIn addition , the high cost and lack of laboratory standardisation\nof HbA  1c  measurement have so far limited its use in the diagnosis\nof glucose intolerance .   \n\n\nDiagnosing diabetes mellitus in the Hong Kong Chinese population\n \n\n \n\nBased on the current literature , we propose that in symptomatic\npatients , a fasting PG or random PG measurement can be used to diagnose\ndiabetes mellitus using the new ADA and WHO criteria .\n\n\nA second measurement on a separate day is required to confirm the\ndiagnosis before clinical management is started .\n\n\nIn epidemiological surveys , either a fasting PG or 2-hour PG\nmeasurement after a 75-g OGTT can be used .\n\n\nTo screen individuals without risk factors for glucose intolerance ,\na fasting PG measurement will be the first choice of test .\n\n\nIn those with risk factors for glucose intolerance , such as a\nfamily history of diabetes , history of gestational diabetes , obesity , or\nhypertension , an OGTT or a single blood test to determine fasting PG and HbA\n 1c  levels should be performed .\n\n\nThe choice between the use of an OGTT or measuring the fasting PG\nand HbA  1c  levels will depend on the patient  ' s preference and the\nresources available in the clinic .\n\n\nIn addition , in some selected high-risk groups , which include\nthose with a history of IGT or IFG , or those with fasting PG and HbA  1c\n levels above certain cut-off levels , an OGTT is the preferred choice\nof test (  Table 2 ) .   \n\n\nConclusion  \n\n \n\nBlood glucose has a continuum relationships with health risks ,\nincluding both microangiopathic and cardiovascular complications , and can\ninteract with other risk factors such as blood pressure and blood lipids to\ncause tissue damage .\n\n\nFurthermore , microangiopathic complications such as retinopathy and\nalbuminuria have been reported in patients with impaired glucose tolerance ,\nincluding Chinese patients.  37,38 \n\n\nThere is now a consensus that the fasting PG cut-off value should be\nreduced to 7.0 mmol/L , although there is still controversy regarding the use\nof OGTT and the definitions of IFG .\n\n\nData from Asia suggest that the omission of the OGTT (  hence the\n2-hour PG measurement ) can lead to - at least in the Japanese and Hong Kong\nChinese populations - the missed diagnosis of glucose intolerance in a\nsubstantial proportion of  cases , if only the fasting PG\nmeasurement is used .\n\n\nHence , the 2-hour PG measurement is indicated in selected\nindividuals with a high risk for glucose intolerance .\n\n\nWell-designed population-based studies that aim to access the\nlong-term significance of these new recommendation to diagnosis categories of\nglucose intolerance in Asian populations are now needed .", "subdomain":

I may have lost the cloud you gave\nme .\n\n\nCan you give me another ? &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThis was mid-summer .\n\n\nNo more silk cotton would fall from the tree , the kangaroo knew that .\n\n\nAnd after the whole spring had past , he understood more about the\nrules of forest .\n\n\nHe didn't owe her anything .\n\n\nHe left the caterpillar , without saying one more word . \n\n \n\nHis legs were long .\n\n\nAfter a few steps , he was already in another part of the forest .\n\n\nBut that distance for the caterpillar was so far that , it would take\nher all her life time to reach there . \n\n \n\nSince that day , she didn't see the kangaroo again , though she\nkept waiting day by day on that tree , and everyday she lived in despair .\n\n\n \n\nIn late summer , she didn't know what was happening to herself .\n\n\nShe fell into a deep sleep .\n\n\nShe thought that she would never wake up , but after a month , she\nwoke up and found that she had turned into colorful butterfly . \n\n \n\nNow , she could fly .\n\n\nThe first thing she wanted to do was to find the kangaroo .\n\n\nThe distance which once would have taken a lifetime to travel , she\ncould now cover in a few minutes . \n\n \n\nNot far away , she saw him .\n\n\nShe was so happy to see her friend again , but before going to meet\nhim , she decided to fly to the sky to get a cloud for him as a present .\n\n\n \n\nShe flew and flew , despite the brightness of the sun .\n\n\nShe saw the cloud .\n\n\nThis time , she saw a real cloud .\n\n\nIt was so big , so soft , so unreal .\n\n\nIt was very different from the cloud which the kangaroo had given her .\n\n\n \n\nShe didn't want that to be true .\n\n\n\" Maybe there are other kinds of clouds .\n\n\nYes , the kangaroo took a month to get there , maybe that kind of\ncloud , the best and the softest kind of cloud , is further up . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nShe flew higher and higher up .\n\n\nThe temperature was getting lower and lower , but she didn't give up .\n\n\nHer wings became frozen by the cold , and finally become so fragile\nthat they broke off and fell down to the earth like ashes . \n\n \n\nAt that moment , she looked down to the ground .\n\n\nThere was a field of soft white clouds .\n\n\nAnd her friend , the kangaroo was there , waving to her and smiling .\n \n\n \n\n\n Unrecoverable Love   \n\n\nSHIRLEY CHAN \n\n \n\nGrace wanted desperately to go to the dinner party with her\nparents and Diana , but her mother had said that more guests would only\ncreate more trouble for the host .\n\n\nGrace remembered that before the birth of her sister , who was seven\nyears younger than herself , her mother had treated her well .\n\n\nTogether , they read stories , went to the playground , and played\naeroplane chess .\n\n\nAll these happy events stopped once Diana was born .\n\n\nRemembering her past happiness , Grace took the little box of\naeroplane chess from the shelf and played all four roles by herself .\n\n\nMother now played the game with Diana .\n\n\nEveryday , Grace prayed she would be allowed to join the game , but\nher wish was never fulfilled .\n\n\nThe dice dropped to the ground and rolled into a corner under the\nsofa .\n\n\nGrace saw a long silver earring .\n\n\nA week ago , her mother had suspected her of stealing it and scolded\nher .\n\n\nA well-behaved student at school , especially in comparison to Diana\n, Grace could not understand her mother  ' s frequent accusations .\n\n\nThinking about this , she went into her mother  ' s bedroom , picked\nup the make-up box from the bedside table and threw it out the bedroom door .\n\n\nThen she opened the top drawer of the bedside table and began\nthrowing things .\n\n\nFinally , she took the large chocolate coloured iron box , and using\nher utmost strength , she threw it out of the door .\n\n\nIt hit Diana on the forehead heavily while she was sitting on the\nsofa taking off her shoes .\n\n\nGrace did not know when her sister had come back .\n\n\nThe iron box burst open and a sheet of paper fell onto the ground .\n\n\nDrops of blood mixed with Grace  ' s tears on the child adoption\ncertificate .  \n\n \n\n\n EARRINGS   \n\n\nBETTY CHAN \n\n \n\nI didn't want to wear the earrings .\n\n\nI was too old for that , but Bonnie put them on for me .\n\n\nMira bought them for her , but she was too young for pearls .\n\n\nMira wanted to bring them back to the shop , but it would be\nimpossible to find another pair as fine as these , so she decided to keep\nthem until Bonnie was old enough .\n\n\nI went into the dining room , and Bonnie  ' s eyes widened .\n\n\nWith a big smile she cried , &lsquo; Let Grandma try those earrings!\n&rsquo;\n\n\nMira laughed and handed her the earrings .\n\n\n&lsquo; Be careful not to hurt Grandma . &rsquo;\n\n\nBonnie pushed me gently into my room .\n\n\n&lsquo; Bonnie , other people will laugh at me ! &rsquo;\n\n\n&lsquo; No , they will be jealous at how beautiful you are . &rsquo;\n\n\nI was embarrassed , but Bonnie made me sit down and put them on for\nme slowly .\n\n\n&lsquo; There you go .\n\n\nGorgeous ! &rsquo;\n\n\nShe stared at me with her radiant smile .\n\n\nMira also walked into the room to look .\n\n\nThe maid standing outside the room smiled at me .\n\n\nWhen I was a girl , my mother taught me that a woman should be\nhumble and not showy .\n\n\nAlthough values had changed , I still felt uncomfortable when\neveryone stared at me .\n\n\nHowever , I did feel excited .\n\n\nI tried to hid my feelings , but the earrings were beautiful .\n\n\n&lsquo; Where  ' s the mirror ? &rsquo;\n\n\n&lsquo; Here you go . &rsquo;\n\n\nI studied my face and looked at the earrings , which were made of\npearls edged with small diamonds .\n\n\nI wore earrings when Bonnie was a child .\n\n\nI took them off before I slept and put them on each morning .\n\n\nWhat was the point for an old woman to wear earrings ?\n\n\nSo I stopped wearing them .\n\n\nThis was the first pair I have worn after so many years , and also\nthe most expensive pair .\n\n\nIf my husband were still here , would he say that I was beautiful ?\n\n\nOr would he ask me to take them off ?\n\n\n&lsquo; We have to go now , &rsquo; Bonnie took my hand .\n\n\n&lsquo; To where ? &rsquo;\n\n\n&lsquo; To the shopping mall .\n\n\nYou promised !

{"text": "NAPCO silent on Allen payoff   \n\n\n By CONNIE LAW  \n\n \n\nTHE Government has again refused to disclose the size of the\npayoff to former Provisional Airport Authority ( PAA ) chief\nexecutive , Mr Richard Allen . \n\n \n\nThe director of the New Airport Projects Co-ordination Office , Mr\nBilly Lam Chung-lun , wrote to legislators yesterday that the PAA board and\nMr Allen had previously entered into an agreement that neither would comment\non the circumstances of his departure . \n\n \n\n\" The board considered that it would be damaging to the\n( new airport ) project if there were a public debate about the\ncircumstances, &rdquo; said Mr Lam . \n\n \n\n\" To breach confidentiality in this case could therefore\nundermine the reputation of the PAA -; both its ability to keep its more\ngeneral contractual obligations as well as those relating specifically to\nconfidentiality . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nUnited Democrats airport spokesman Mr Albert Chan Wai-yip said he\nwas extremely dissatisfied with the answer . \n\n \n\nHe added his party would carefully consider whether to exercise\ntheir power through the Legislative Council ( Powers and Privileges\n) Ordinance to ask Mr Macleod to disclose the information .  \n\n \n\n\n First Pay-TV operator to have exclusive rights for three years\n  \n\n\n By CONNIE LAW  \n\n \n\nHONGKONG  ' s first Pay-TV licence should be issued by January 1993\n, and any licensee has to bring its system into operation within six to nine\nmonths , the Executive Council has decided . \n\n \n\nThe Governor-in-Council gave approval for the licensee to have an\nexclusive right to provide subscription television services for three years .\n\n\n \n\nBut Hongkong  ' s sole satellite TV operator , STAR TV , would not\nbe barred from operating subscription services provided it met stringent\nconditions after October 1993 . \n\n \n\nThe Exco decided that should STAR TV wish to introduce\nsatellite-based subscription services on a regional basis on top of its\nexisting free-to-air service , it had to meet the condition of no\nbroadcasting of Cantonese programmes in Hongkong during the three-year period\ngiven to the Hongkong Pay-TV licensee . \n\n \n\nThe Exco decisions were made on Tuesday and are to be formally\nannounced this afternoon . \n\n \n\nThe restriction on Cantonese broadcasting applied to STAR TV will\nbe partially lifted in October 1993 when three of its five channels -;\nnamely news , sport and music -; will be allowed to broadcast Cantonese\nprogrammes . \n\n \n\nA review will be carried out in October 1994 with a view to\nallowing further Cantonese broadcasting on STAR  ' s remaining two channels .\n\n\n \n\nExecutive Councillors are understood to have seen some advantage\nin the provision of cable-based operations as opposed to microwave operations\n, due to cable  ' s quality of transmission and its potential for developing\nancillary interactive services .  Therefore , the Exco decision says the\nGovernment would give favourable consideration to companies which intend to\nintroduce cable-based services , but it fell short of specifying which\ndelivery technology the licensee should adopt . \n\n \n\nExco also approved the adoption of a flexible approach in terms\nof geographical coverage , programming and subscription rates for the new\nlicensee . \n\n \n\nOther than \" home-shopping &rdquo; channels , other Pay-TV\nchannels will not be allowed to run advertisements during the first three\nyears .\n\n\nThe moratorium will be reviewed at the end of the period . \n\n \n\nThe provider of subscription TV will not be required to provide a\nsecond fixed link telecommunications network , but should a bidder wish to\nprovide telecommunications services over its network , it will be allowed to\ndo so . \n\n \n\nNo company of which Cable and Wireless or any of its subsidiaries\nowns more than 15 per cent of its share capital will be allowed to bid for\nthe licence . \n\n \n\nThe licensee would have to pay royalties on subscription income\non a sliding scale of up to 7 1/2 per cent.\n\n\nBut the ceiling rate should not be applied until 250,000 households\nhave subscribed to the service . \n\n \n\nThe two terrestrial broadcasters , Television Broadcast and Asia\nTelevision , from October 1993 onwards , will also have their royalty payment\nreduced by about two per cent based on a formula to be worked out by the\nadministration . \n\n \n\nA consultancy study carried out by the Government predicts that\nthe lifting of all restrictions on Cantonese broadcasting by STAR TV could\nmarginally affect the profitability of TVB and ATV by about two per cent of\ntotal available net advertising revenue . \n\n \n\nSome of the existing restrictions laid down in the two stations  ' \ncurrent regulatory framework , that is programming , advertising and\nownership restriction should be relaxed .  \n\n \n\n\n Councillors to keep share deals secret   \n\n\n By CONNIE LAW  \n\n \n\nEXECUTIVE Councillors have decided not to make public their\ndealings on the local stock exchange . \n\n \n\nThey discussed the issue and decided they would only consider\nreleasing information about their dealings to the Exco secretariat . \n\n \n\nThe issue of conflict of interest has come under the spotlight\nagain after the Government sued former acting secretary for works Kenneth\nKwok Wai-kai for making &dollar;30 million by allegedly abusing his position .\n\n\n \n\nMr Kwok is alleged to have delayed moves to limit development\npotential in Mid-Levels until he had sold a family property in the area .\n\n\n \n\nThe Financial Secretary , Sir Hamish Macleod , said last year\nthat the administration would look at whether to introduce a system of\nregistration and declaration of transactions in the local investment market .\n\n\n \n\nThe system could follow the disclosure rules used by directors of\nthe Securities and Futures Commission , he said . \n\n \n\nExco members believe that their secretariat , staffed by civil\nservants , could monitor whether any non-official members had any conflicts\nof interests . \n\n \n\nThey explained that it would be difficult to reveal every sale\nand purchase of stock to the public because a few Exco members sat on the\nboards of listed companies and any revelation might be commercially sensitive .\n\n\n \n\nSome members were also said to be unwilling to let the public\nknow if they made or lost money in the transactions . \n\n \n\nSenior Executive Councillor Lady Dunn said there were\nwell-established procedures regarding declarations of interest . \n\n \n\n\" Members  '  directorships are declared in a register ,\nwhich is available for public inspection, &rdquo; she said . \n\n \n\nShe said the administration was reviewing this matter . \n\n \n\n\" Whether there should be additional declarations will have\nto await the outcome of the review . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nConcern has been growing since early last year about the\npossibility of Exco members using the information they have on issues such as\nthe Sino-British row to make money on the stock exchange . \n\n \n\nIt is understood the Independent Commission Against Corruption\ngoes through all documents to Exco members to ensure there are no potential\nconflicts of interest . \n\n \n\nExco members are not given the documents and are asked not to\nattend meetings on subjects with which they have a conflict of interest .\n\n\n \n\nThe Securities ( Insider Dealing ) Ordinance also\napplies to them in relation to the use and disclosure of privileged\ninformation .  \n\n \n\n\n Democrats might demand inquiry   \n\n\n By CONNIE LAW  \n\n \n\nTHE United Democrats said they might ask for a Legislative\nCouncil select committee to look into the Kwun Lung Lau landslide if the\nGovernor refused to set up an independent inquiry . \n\n \n\nLegislators voted on Friday in favour of a judicial inquiry into\nthe July 23 landslide which killed five people . \n\n \n\nChairman of the House Committee Elsie Tu and vice-chairman Andrew\nWong Wang-fat relayed the request to Acting Governor Anson Chan Fang On-sang\nyesterday . \n\n \n\nBut United Democrat Albert Chan Wai-yip said the party was upset\nby Mrs Chan  ' s \" passive attitude &rdquo; to the request . \n\n \n\nUnder the Legislative Council ( Powers and Privileges\n) Ordinance , a select committee has the power to ask for any\ndocuments and the attendance of anyone to give evidence . \n\n \n\nMrs Chan said a decision had to be made by the Executive Council .\n\n\nExco is in recess until August 30 . \n\n \n\nShe said the most pressing task was to complete the\nadministration  ' s own investigation .\n\n\nShe did not want to see a members  '  request putting a brake on it .\n\n\n \n\n\" We will consider this request when we receive a formal\nletter together with the terms of reference, &rdquo; she said.\n\n\nMrs Tu sent in a formal request yesterday afternoon . \n\n \n\nAnother party member said the Government  ' s study , to be\nconducted by geotechnical expert Dr Norbert Morgenstern , lacked independence\nand transparency and would not be as comprehensive as that sought by members .\n\n\n \n\nMrs Chan said Mr Morgenstern would arrive on August 19 and his\nfindings would be published . \n\n \n\nResidents of Block D on the Housing Society estate returned to\ntheir homes yesterday . \n\n \n\nThey were evacuated amid fears their building could collapse .\n \n\n \n\n\n Poon to run in Kowloon Tong   \n\n\n By CONNIE LAW  \n\n \n\nAPPOINTED legislator Steven Poon Kwok-lim yesterday ended weeks\nof speculation and revealed he would run in next month  ' s district board\nelections . \n\n \n\nMr Poon is the first -; and believed to be the only -;\nLiberal Party legislator to stand . \n\n \n\nHe said \" Politics involve the masses .\n\n\nI realise that if I want to spend more time on politics in future , I\nhave to start with the grassroots . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nMr Poon , ex-general manager of China Light and Power , denied he\nwas being contradictory in saying that he wanted to be closer to the\ngrassroots while running in the middle-class Kowloon Tong constituency . \n\n \n\nHe said : \" It doesn't mean you don't have livelihood\nproblems if you own a car ... It doesn't mean the district does not have\ngrassroots if there is no public housing . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nMr Poon , appointed to the Legislative Council in 1991 , said he\ndid not choose Kowloon Tong because there were no public housing tenants\n-; perceived as supporters of the small \" l &rdquo; liberals -;\nand therefore had a higher chance of winning . \n\n \n\n\" I chose Kowloon Tong because I lived there for 26 years\nand I know the district well, &rdquo; he said .\n\n\nMr Poon now lives in Shouson Hill . \n\n \n\nMr Poon said it was too early to say whether he would run for\nLegco next year through the Election Committee .\n\n\nAll district board members elected in September will form the\ncommittee which will return 10 legislators . \n\n \n\n\" I am very happy to have the chance to ask people to vote\nfor me ...\n\n\nIt  ' s a very challenging task, &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\nThe candidate list released by the party last Thursday said\nanother party member , Eddie Wong , was to run for the same constituency .\n\n\n \n\nVice-chairman of the party  ' s executive committee Chan Yim-kwong\nsaid Mr Wong had decided not to contest because he had to retake his law .\n\n\n \n\nHe denied Mr Wong was forced to give way to Mr Poon . \n\n \n\nMr Poon could face at least one opponent , Ho Hin-ming , who is\nnot affiliated to any party .\n\n\nAn ex-Liberal Party member , Mervyn Cheung Man-ping , yesterday said\nhe might run in Kowloon Tong as well . \n\n \n\nAnother 32 people signed up for the district boards yesterday ,\nbringing the total to 637 .  \n\n \n\n\n Inactivity on port enrages industry   \n\n\n By CONNIE LAW  \n\n \n\nTHE container-terminal industry has lashed out at what it says is\nthe Government  ' s lack of leadership on port development in Hong Kong . \n\n \n\nIt also claims that a Government-commissioned study says the\nfirst berths at Container Terminal 10 ( CT10 ) will not come on\nstream until January 1999 and the others until October 1999 , which means 19\nmonths and 28 months late respectively . \n\n \n\nIn a recent submission to the Lantau Port Liaison Group , five\ncurrent and future container-terminal operators and the Hong Kong Liner\nShipping Association say : \" There appears to be no one driving the\ndevelopment of the port .\n\n\nThere is no single department having control over the key issues and\ntimely decisions . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe Port Development Board under the Economic Services Branch is\nin charge of port development . \n\n \n\n\" The confusion and delay over the development of the\ncontainer port since Container Terminal Eight leads us to believe that the\ninstitutional arrangements for Government decisions are unsatisfactory . \n\n \n\n\" There has been a severe lack of resources devoted to the\nneeds of the port . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe submission , dated August 1 , says the operators cannot move\nwithout initial decisions by the Government . \n\n \n\nThe industry proposes setting up a Lantau and Western Harbour\nProject Office under the Port Development Board to be responsible for the\noverall planning , management and co-ordination of the Lantau Port\nDevelopment , including CT10 and CT11 . \n\n \n\nThe office should be headed by a project director recruited from\nthe private sector and have a professional staff of six to eight . \n\n \n\nThe Mass Transit Railway Corporation and the airport authority\ndemonstrated the advantages of having overall management control in a single\noffice and placing management decisions in an authority with a degree of\nindependence from bodies that \" have many diverse priorities &rdquo; .\n\n\n \n\nThe industry says the proposal was raised in a 1992 consultancy\nreport commissioned by the Civil Engineering Department and it should be\nimplemented as soon as possible . \n\n \n\nThe Government should now be seeking expressions of interests in\nthe construction and management of CT10 and CT11 . \n\n \n\nAnd \" the experience with Terminal Nine makes it essential\nto consult the Chinese authorities immediately on all issues of Lantau Port\n&rdquo; , it says . \n\n \n\n\" The decision to split the allocation of Terminal Nine\nleaves the Kwai Chung-Tsing Yi area fragmented . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe Government has split the four berths of CT9 between two\noperators . \n\n \n\nFor CT10 and CT11 , operators should be given at least four\nberths in order to handle fourth and fifth generation container ships . \n\n \n\nIt says the demand for throughput in 1999 would be some 3.4\nmillion 20-foot equivalent units in excess of the capacity of CT1 to CT9 .\n\n\n \n\nThe shortfall will lead to congestion problems in Kwai Chung\ncontainer port and the New Territories from 1995 if no new capacity is\ndeveloped . \n\n \n\nIt is vital for the Government to immediately intensify planning\nfor the development of the Lantau Port , comprehensively assess the capacity\nof Southern China ports and allocate waterfront and backup land to the\nexisting operators to ensure maximum throughput capacity , the submission\nsays .  \n\n \n\n\n Quebec losing immigrants   \n\n\n By CONNIE LAW  \n\n \n\nLESS than half of the investor immigrants to Quebec remain after\nmaking the required investment , a senior official from the Canadian province\nhas said . \n\n \n\nQuebec , the only Canadian province which has its own\nimmigration laws , has had two business immigration schemes in force since\n1986 . \n\n \n\nThe entrepreneur scheme requires an immigrant to invest\nC&dollar;200,000 ( HK&dollar;1.22 million ) and create three\njobs in the province , while the investor scheme calls for an investment of\nC&dollar;350,000 . \n\n \n\nLast year , 45,000 people emigrated to Quebec , of which 53 per\ncent were businessmen and professionals.\n\n\nAmong the businessmen , about one-third joined the investor scheme .\n\n\n \n\nThe Quebec Government  ' s director of immigration service in\nHongkong , Mr Pierre Danis , said more than 4,000 Hongkong people emigrated\nto the province last year , with about one-sixth doing do under the\ninvestment scheme . \n\n \n\nThe total figure was higher than usual because of a backlog.\n\n\nOn average , 2,500 moved . \n\n \n\nQuebec  ' s Minister of Cultural Communities and Immigration , Mrs\nMonique Gagnon-Tremblay , said that while the rate of retention for the\nentrepreneur scheme was as high as 75 per cent , that for the investor scheme\nwas below 50 per cent , although she did not have the exact figures . \n\n \n\nShe said the low retention rate was possibly because the scheme\nwas a passive one and immigrants only had to put their money in investment\nfunds . \n\n \n\nSome Hongkong immigrants were also returning to the territory\nbecause the province had gone through a recession and people wanted to take\nadvantage of the booming economy in southern China . \n\n \n\nMrs Gagnon-Tremblay , who is on a trip to the territory to see\nhow the scheme can be improved , said she had found that potential migrants\nwanted more flexibility from the scheme . \n\n \n\nResults of a government study of the schemes may be completed\nthis year . \n\n \n\nMr Danis also revealed that the number of people applying to\nemigrate to Quebec for the first four months of this year was only about half\nthe figure for last year . \n\n \n\nHis office received only 200 applications from January to April\n, while 400 applications were received in the same period last year . \n\n \n\n\" When the Hang Seng Index goes up , the number of\napplications goes down, &rdquo; Mr Danis said . \n\n \n\nHe believed that other major immigration destinations for\nHongkong people , like the United States and Australia , had also experienced\na drop in applications from the territory . \n\n \n\nBut interest in Quebec elsewhere -; in South Korea and\nTaiwan , for example -; had stayed at the same level .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "2cf506ef-e30a-41d4-aa33-fbe22ca42f26", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.030097+00:00"}

{"text": "I am going to answer this question from a Marxist perspective , as\nI think Marx  ' s theory on class analysis is relevant in evaluating the\npresent family structure and familial ideology . \n \n\nFamilies are basic units of societies .\n\n\nThey have changed from stem family , extended or joint family to the\nnuclear family of nowadays .\n\n\nAccording to the functionalist views , families are expected to carry\nout functions or duties such as procreation , emotional gratification ,\nsocialization of the young , stabilization of adult personality etc .\n\n\nIn return , societies reward family members with continuity of\ncompanionship , economic rewards etc .\n\n\nMoreover , each family members is expected to carry out complementary\nroles , such as husbands , fathers , mothers , wives , sons and daughters .\n\n \n\nIn the past , families used to be centre of production .\n\n\nAll family members were expected to work towards the betterment of the\nwhole family .\n\n\nHowever , with the change in the family structure from extended family\nto the nuclear family , many of the functions of the families as existed in\nthe old family structure are taken over by social institutions .\n\n\nFor example , education is taken up by schools , colleges ,\nemployment by factories etc . \n \n\nWith the change in family structure comes the changes in the\nroles of family members and even people  ' s attitude towards marriage .\n\n\nPeople tend to get married at a later age and some even refuse\nmarriage .\n\n\nWhen people get married , they hope to find a companion to go hand in\nhand with him to cope with all the difficulties in life , rather than at the\nrequests of their parents . \n \n\nAlthough I have talked about the change in family structure ,\nsome traditional family concepts remain persistent , especially in the sexual\ndivision of labour .\n\n\nMen are expected to carry out the duties of wage earners , while\nwomen to stay at home to take care of the household chores and the rearing of\nthe young .\n\n\nIn this way , it is considered that the roles of the males are\ninstrumental while those of the females are expressive ones .\n\n\nAccording to the functionalist views , it is when each of the family\nmember carries out his own role accordingly and satisfactorily then family\nsolidarity can be achieved .\n\n\nIn other words , if women should go out to work in the labour market\n, a breakdown in family solidarity is inevitable .\n\n\nBut I wonder if this is the true reality or that such a family\nideology is a distortion of the true picture , aiming at the rested interests\nof a group of people in society , in this context , the males ? \n \n\nTo understanding the above arguments .\n\n\nI shall first state some salient points about the family ideology .\n\n\nAlthough there is no definition which is generally agreed upon by all\nsociologists , a general working definition by Veronica Beechey may help us\nto grasp a general idea of the concept: \n\n\n Family Ideology refers to systems of beliefs of certain\nkinship system and a set of living arrangements ( such as the\ncoresident nuclear family ) , in which the males are wage earners\nwhile the females are carers at home .\n\n\nAnd this sexual division of labour is basically biologically\ndetermined .\n\n\nTherefore the concept is universally accepted and normatively\ndesirable .   \n \n\nAccording to this concept , the females are undoubtedly made\ndependent on the males , at least economically .\n\n\nSome of the feminist writers even think that the females are used as\ndocile labour reserve , which means that they would be asked to help out in\nthe labour market when there is a shortage in labour force but when there is\na surplus in labour , they would be required to go back to their home to\ncarry out their duties as housewives . \n \n\nI shall go on to examine whether such an ideology is a distorted\nview or just false consciousness from a Marxist perspective .\n\n\nTo put it in the Marxist framework of class analysis , the males and\nthe females are two opposing classes at two extremes .\n\n\nThe men are the ruling class while the women the oppressed , just\nlike the bourgeoisie and the proletariat , or the capitalists and the working\nclass .\n\n\nThe males belonging to a group with vested interests , advocate such\nideas like: the importance for child rearing by women , the need for women to\ntake care of their husbands who are badly in need of care and emotional\ngratification after a day  ' s hard work , etc , so that the women\nunconsciously admit that it is their duties to stay at home to carry out\nhousehold duties unpaid , without leave and most of all without due\nrecognition from society .\n\n\nMoreover , the females are being used as a \" means to an end\n&rdquo; -;\n\n\nthey have to satisfy their men  ' s needs in order to prepare them for\nwork the following days . \n \n\nAs the women have not come to realize their being oppressed ,\nthey are unable to come to a state which Marx has termed \" a class for\nitself &rdquo; , which means that they cannot group themselves together for\nspecific purposes to get back what they deserve .\n\n\nThe women have been placed in a passive position in which they cannot\nperceive the reality of the world .\n\n\nIt is unrealistic that they should be made to believe that what they\nare doing is a \" great job &rdquo; , not to be taken over by the males .\n\n\nThis kind of \" false consciousness &rdquo; has indeed generated\ngender inequality in which women are the victims .\n\n\nOnly a socialist economic revolution may overthrow this according to\nMarx . \n \n\nI shall answer this question with reference to the medicalization\nof deviance .\n\n\nI shall examine the growing influence of the medical model by looking\nat its intended and unintended effects and finally how social work practice\ncan work against it . \n \n\nWhen one says that a society is \" over-medicalized, &rdquo;\nhe is presuming the immense influence of the medical discipline .\n\n\nI shall take the example of its relevance to deviance to illustrate\nmy argument .\n\n\nFirst of all .\n\n\nmedicalization of deviance refers to the individualization of\ndeviance , which means that both diagnosis and treatment , terms commonly\nused by medical personnel , will be directed to the person who commits the\ndeviance .\n\n\nDeviance in turn refers to any act which goes beyond the expectation\nor to be more specific the norms of a society .\n\n\nFor example ,   alcoholism  , homosexuality ,\ndrug addiction etc . which are not accepted by our society as a whole . \n \n\nThe medicalization of deviance may be in the form of three:\nmedical technology , medical collaboration and medical ideology .\n\n\nMedical technology simply means the application of medicine or\ntechnological treatment , such as brain surgery , psychological sessions etc .\n\n\nto treat an individual who is diagnosed to be suffering from deviance .\n\n\nTechnical collaboration means the cooperation of the medical\npersonnel with other disciplines .\n\n\nFor example , when a doctor comes across a suspected child abuse case\n, he may need to inform the police or the social Welfare Department , so that\na more concrete welfare plan can be formulated for the child and his family .\n\n\nMedical ideology refers to the belief that medical treatment is for\nthe benefit or the well being all people . \n \n\nMore passages will be spent on the third aspect - whether\nmedicalization of deviance is good for the people concerned .\n\n\nThe most significant benefit for a person who committed a deviant act\ne.g. drug addiction , may be that when he is assigned a sick role , he is\nfree from the responsibility of committing deviant act .\n\n\nTherefore , when he is treated , he may go back to society without\ncarrying the label of a deviant . \n \n\nSecondly , the family of the deviant or the sick person may\nbenefit as well .\n\n\nThey do not feel ashamed or guilty for having a deviant member in the\nfamily . \n \n\nThirdly , both the \" deviant &rdquo; or his family have the\nself-fulfilling prophecy that the \" deviant &rdquo; is only sick and he\nwill soon be recovered there is a hope among the parties concerned . \n \n\nDespite the above seemingly advantages , there is still the dark\nside of the story .\n\n\nFirstly , when a deviant is conferred a sick role , he can shun away\nhis responsibility for committing the deviant act .\n\n\nIn doing so , there is a confusion about who should shoulder the\nresponsibility for the deviant act .\n\n\nIt would be undesirable or to the extreme , carry the effect of\nnegative reinforcement for the deviant . \n \n\nSecondly .\n\n\nas long as the person is considered as sick , he would be looked upon\nby society as a dependent or useless person as most people still consider\nsickness as undesirable . \n \n\nI think our society is to some extent \" over-medicalized\n&rdquo; especially when the medical personnel is assigned such high social\nstatus .\n\n\nWhen I say so , I would quote the example of a child abuse case\nconference .\n\n\nIn the conference , there would be representatives from the Hospital\nServices Department , the Royal Hong Kong Police Force , the Social Welfare\nDepartment .\n\n\nEach of the representative is expected to give his views about the\ncase and then decide whether the case is a genuine child abuse case .\n\n\nHowever , when the doctors produce such evidence as X'ray films of\nbone fractures/dislocation etc. , and when the doctors say that it is a\ngenuine child abuse case , no counter-arguments are any more effective .\n\n\nOne factor for such phenomenon is like what I just mentioned , the\nhigh social status of doctors and the hard-to-understand terminology of the\nmedical discipline , which has certainly threatened the people working\noutside the medical discipline . \n \n\nA second example , a hyperkinetic child may be simply given some\ntranquilliser to curb down his hyperactivity , so that he may sit down in his\nclassroom and be less disturbing to his classmates .\n\n\nMedicine in this aspect may be really helpful because the effect of\nthe medication has made the hyperkinetic child dull and feel drowsy . \n \n\nBy simply prescribing medication to treat certain deviants may\nhave the risk of oversimplifying the problem .\n\n\nTaking the example of the hyperkinetic child again , it is possible\nthat the child runs about in the classroom or any hyperactive acts may be a\nmanifestation of his dislike for the school or his reluctance for studies .\n\n\nTherefore , medication cannot treat the core of the problem . \n \n\nAs a social work practitioner , I would like strongly emphasize\nthe need to look at a deviant and his problem within the social context .\n\n\nThat is I would look at his immediate environment , his significant\nothers , his upbringing , his family background etc . \n \n\nAs Bandura has often , emphasized the theory of reciprocal\ninteraction , i.e. the interaction of the person , his behaviour and his\nenvironment , it is unwise to look at the deviant in the vacuum of a social\ncontext .\n\n\nTherefore , I would say that the medical model should only provide a\nperspective for us to look at the problem but it should not be the only\neffective means to treat the deviant and his behaviour .\n\n\nOtherwise , the chances are that the deviants would soon relapse into\ndeviant behaviour again . \n \n\nI agree with the statement that \" Hong Kong policy is\nrather elitist and authoritative \" . \n \n\nHong Kong is now ruled under two models .\n\n\nFirst the Bureaucratic Polity Model , and second , the Elite Ruling\nModel .\n\n\nThe Bureaucratic Polity Model shows that Hong Kong is ruled by a\ncentralized bureaucracy .\n\n\nThere is no legitimized channels to observe the operation of the\nbureaucracy and people in general have no legitimate means to channel their\nviews to the bureaucracy . \n \n\nUnder the Elite Ruling Model , Hong Kong is ruled by a group of\nrich businessmen who have strong relation with the government .\n\n\nThey are admitted to the government under two legislatures , the Exco\nand Legco .\n\n\nA look at the background of these people may help you to understand\nwhy I agree with the statement that Hong Kong is rather elitist and\nauthoritative .\n\n\nMost of the Exco and Legco members come from the upper class they are\nmostly directors from large corporation , eg. the Hong Kong Bank , and come\nfrom rich families .\n\n\nSince they have similar background , eg. they live in similar\nresidential areas , they go to the same recreational clubs , and they appear\nin the same charitable organizations , they naturally share the same\ninterests .\n\n\nThey realize that , as Marx puts it , they are \" a class for\nitself &rdquo; .\n\n\nTherefore , they are inclined to work towards their own benefit ,\nwhich to certain extent , is the benefit of Hong Kong as most of their\nbusiness has economic significance on Hong Kong . \n \n\nTo understand whether Hong Kong can become more pluralistic and\ndemocratic , I shall examine it under 3 categories , the economic development\n, political culture and political organization . \n \n\nEconomic development - Hong Kong government has often adopted the\nlaissez faire economic policy and  \nnon-interventionist  approach to the Chinese culture .\n\n\nAs Hong Kong has rised rapidly in economic expansion in the recent\ndecade , most of the people of Hong Kong have rised above the subsistence\nlevel which means that there are more complicated demands from the people .\n\n\nThe government need to change to meet these demands which can no\nlonger be satisfied by private means .\n\n\nThese demands include better living environment , better education\nsystem etc . \n \n\nPolitical culture- the people have always been ambivalent towards\nthe government , in fact towards politics as a whole , they have low\nparticipation in elections and not much say in political issues etc .\n\n\nThey leave everything to the government as long as what it is doing\nis not detrimental to them .\n\n\nWhereas , the government has often adopted a \n patriarchal  approach to deal with the affairs of Hong Kong and they\nbelieve that they are working for the \" common good \" of the\npeople of Hong Kong. \n \n\nPolitical organization -; after the signing of the\nSino-British agreement on 26.9.1984 , there seem to be a rise in the number\nof political organizations working towards a democratic government .\n\n\nHowever , these organizations have not been able to persuade the\nmasses to develop more interests in political issues .\n\n\nThe people of HK still maintain low participation &ampersand; low\ninterest in politics . \n \n\nWhether Hong Kong can be more pluralistic and democratic and\nwhether it can carry on as it is beyond 1997 &semi; from the above three\npoints , it can be anticipated that HK seems to be lacking adequate\npreconditions for a more pluralistic &ampersand; democratic government ,\nespecially when many educated people or well-off people who are supposed to\nbe more interested in political affairs have emigrated to other countries .\n\n\nI doubt very much whether the lower strata who have to earn a\nhand-to-mouth living would be more participatory in Hong Kong affairs . \n \n\nChina factor is indeed another important factor to influence the\nattitude of the people .\n\n\nWhen there is so much uncertainty about Chinese rule , it is\ndifficult to predict how HK would be like after 1997 .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f0f02177-8164-4506-99d8-7f71a00bd9f2", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.032784+00:00"}
{"text": "Political interference   \n\n\n Margaret Ng  \n\n \n\n JUST BY COINCIDENCE,  the conviction of\nAmerican-Chinese scholars Li Shaomin and Gao Zhan of espionage in Beijing and\ntheir release to the United States last week followed the Hong Kong Court of\nFinal Appeal  ' s (  CFA's ) decisions in Chong Fung-yuen and two other\nright-of-abode cases a week earlier .\n\n\nThe juxtaposition of the two events gives much food for thought . \n\n \n\nThe reality of the outcome of the Beijing trials is clear to\neveryone , whatever the trappings of law and court procedure .\n\n\nThey are political deals carefully worked out between Beijing and\nWashington DC .\n\n\nThe  Hong Kong Economic Journal  spoke for many when it said\nin its editorial last Friday: \" Time and again , the Chinese Government\ntreats the law as merely a game and a political tool in diplomatic wrangles\nfor political interests .\n\n\nHow then can the courts on the mainland hope to establish their\nauthority ?\n\n\nHow can its legal system hope to give compatriots and foreigners any\nconfidence ? \n\n \n\nHow distant is China from the rule of law . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe rule of law crumples when the courts ' decisions become\npolitical bargaining chips .\n\n\nThis is true not only of the mainland .\n\n\nIt is true anywhere , including the Hong Kong SAR under Chinese\nsovereignty . \n\n \n\nIf the CFA  ' s July 20 judgment regarding Chong Fung-yuen has been\nhailed by the legal community and others in Hong Kong , it is , first and\nforemost , because it is perceived as the CFA reclaiming a measure of its\nautonomy put into jeopardy by the National People  ' s Congress Standing\nCommittee  ' s interpretation in June 1999 , and its own capitulating judgment\nin the right-of-abode case of Lau Kong-yung which followed this in December\nthe same year . \n\n \n\nThere are important safeguards laid down in the latest judgment ,\ndeserving of admiration .\n\n\nFirst , there is the clear declaration that the courts in Hong Kong\nare duty-bound under the Basic Law to interpret its provisions according to\ncommon-law principles . \n\n \n\nSecond , there is the unequivocal rejection of the Government  ' s\nproposal to broaden the conditions under which the CFA is required to refer a\nBasic Law provision to the Standing Committee for interpretation . \n\n \n\nThird , there is the CFA  ' s refusal to label \" black\n&rdquo; as \" white &rdquo; when Article 24(2)(1 ) of the Basic Law\nplainly states that any Chinese national born in Hong Kong is a Hong Kong\npermanent resident . \n\n \n\nWhatever else one may say of the CFA  ' s judgment , these rulings\nof the court are important , far-reaching and a boost to Hong Kong  ' s\nindependent judicial power under the \" one country , two systems &rdquo;\nprinciple .\n\n\nHad the court succumbed on these issues , independent judicial power\nwould have been bereft of all meaning .\n\n\nIn Chong Fung-yuen  ' s case , it might be said , the CFA has politely\nput its foot down . \n\n \n\nYet survival is not without casualty , and the casualty is heavy\nenough .\n\n\nTo begin with , the survival is achieved by a judicial retreat .\n\n\nThe CFA reiterates that the Standing Committee has the power to\ninterpret any provision of the Basic Law at any time , and that such an\ninterpretation will be binding on Hong Kong  ' s courts . \n\n \n\nIt is only where the Standing Committee has not issued an\ninterpretation - as was the case with Article 24(2)(1 ) - that the Hong Kong\ncourts are free to interpret , and it is then that the interpretation must be\nin accordance with common-law principles . \n\n \n\nThe clear consequence of this statement of law is that Hong Kong  ' s\njudicial autonomy and the common law are retained only to the degree that the\nStanding Committee chooses to allow it , and that Hong Kong  ' s autonomy will\nthus depend entirely on Beijing  ' s self-restraint . \n\n \n\nThe CFA  ' s ruling indicates that , although the Standing\nCommittee can do what it likes , the Hong Kong courts will not compromise the\ncommon law on their own . \n\n \n\nThe statement of the NPC Legislative Affairs Commission\nexpressing concern at the CFA  ' s judgment for not being \" completely in\naccord &rdquo; with the Standing Committee  ' s interpretation of June 1999\nindicates Beijing will not leave the matter like this for long . \n\n \n\nWhat Beijing wants is that the court should voluntarily consider\nitself bound not only by the content of any interpretation of specific\nprovisions by the Standing Committee , but as if the meaning of that\ninterpretation is now written into the relevant articles of the law in the\nsame way as an amendment to the law .\n\n\nIt also wants the courts to be bound by the reasoning which led to\nthe interpretation , or which can be distilled from it , as if the\ninterpretation were a judgment of a superior court . \n\n \n\nEven if there is to be no immediate re-interpretation of this\nlatest case by the Standing Committee , Beijing will continue to storm the\ncitadel .\n\n\nAnd , as Solicitor-General Robert Allcock told the press , the\nGovernment will continue to press the view of the Legislative Affairs\nCommission before the Hong Kong courts . \n\n \n\nThis means that while the courts will uphold the common law , the\nGovernment will continue to follow the Basic Law as annotated by Beijing .\n\n\n \n\nAnother major casualty resulting from the judicial retreat on\nanother front is humanity .\n\n\nIn the landmark judgment of Ng Ka-ling and Chan Kam-nga in January\n1999 , the CFA adopted the \" purposive and generous interpretation\n&rdquo; as the proper approach for the interpretation of the Basic Law as a\nconstitutional instrument .\n\n\nThis means the court  ' s interpretation of the provisions of the Basic\nLaw must take account of international covenants protecting fundamental\nrights , which are part of the context in which such provisions need to be\nconsidered . \n\n \n\nBut in the July 20 judgment of the Chong Fung-yuen case , the CFA\nhas introduced the idea of ambiguity .\n\n\nAnd the ground rule formulated by the court in this latest case is\nthat when the language of the Basic Law is clear - that is to say , free from\nambiguity - then extrinsic materials cannot affect the interpretation . \n\n \n\nThat ground rule was fine as far as it went in Chong Fung-yuen  ' s\ncase .\n\n\nBut in the adopted-children judgment of Agnes Tam Nga-yin - which was\ndelivered on the same day - it foundered and produced the anomalous result\nthat on the fundamental issue of the right of abode , adopted children are\ntreated differently from biological children .\n\n\nThis occurred despite the fact that the domestic laws of Hong Kong\nand of China , as well as the spirit of international covenants protecting\nthe right of family unity and the rights of the child , decree that lawfully\nadopted children are to be treated just the same as if they are children born\nto their adoptive parents in lawful wedlock . \n\n \n\nThe court  ' s decision , which in effect nullifies the legal\neffect of adoption when it comes to the right of abode , will have disturbing\nconsequences for adoptive families and the institution of adoption itself .\n\n\n \n\nHere , the ground rule set out in Chong Fung-yuen  ' s case has\nundergone a subtle mutation .\n\n\nThe starting point is ambiguity , and it is only when an ambiguity in\nthe language is established that the court can go on to consider the Bill of\nRights and domestic laws relating to adopted children , which are \"\npart of the context &rdquo; that then needs to be taken into account .\n\n\nBut since no ambiguity was found in the language of the relevant\nBasic Law provision , that part of the context could not be considered in the\nadopted-children case . \n\n \n\nThe social consequences of denying adopted children the\nentitlement to right of abode under the Basic Law can , one hopes , be\nalleviated by policy implemented through domestic legislation .\n\n\nFor example , by legislating that adopted children whose adoption is\nrecognised by Hong Kong law shall be given permission to enter and remain in\nHong Kong , so that they would eventually gain permanent-resident status\nafter seven years . \n\n \n\nHowever , the legacy of a rule of interpretation that excludes\nregard for human rights unless there is an ambiguity in the language will be\na serious setback .\n\n\nIt will take Hong Kong  ' s common-law development back to an obsolete\nstage . \n\n \n\nCertainly , it will leave Hong Kong out of the full-steam-ahead\nreception of human-rights values into the common law in England and Wales\nfollowing the recent enactment of the Human Rights Act , as explained by Lord\nWoolf , the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales at a seminar held in Hong\nKong last Wednesday .\n\n\nA British expert on the Act , Keir Starmer , reported the courts\nthere are now duty-bound to read and give effect to legislation in a way\nwhich is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights , without\nthe need to find an ambiguity . \n\n \n\nIt is ironic that Hong Kong  ' s highest court is prepared to\nretreat , even as Lord Woolf acknowledges that the British Act learned much\nfrom the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance in terms of advancing human\nrights . \n\n \n\nThis retreat could cost Hong Kong its rights and freedom sooner\nand more drastically than people may imagine . \n\n \n\nOne area is the imminent Article 23 legislation against treason ,\nsubversion , theft of state secrets and so on .\n\n\nThe other is the chilling effect of the Li Shaomin and Gao Zhan cases\non academic research and development .\n\n\nUnless rights are rigorously upheld by the courts , they will\ndisappear quickly , and with it Hong Kong  ' s last foothold for being\nconsidered a strong legal system underpinning the rule of law . \n\n \n\nEven now , evidence is being given before a court in Canada -\nduring a refugee hearing to decide whether Lai Changxing should be sent back\nto face trial on the mainland - that the strongest assurance of a fair trial\ntaking place in China is political pressure and the glare of international\npublicity . \n\n \n\nThis is an abyss indeed . Unless Hong Kong draws back resolutely\n, the date it will be drawn into it will not be as distant as some may choose\nto believe . \n\n \n\n Margaret Ng Ngoi-yee is a legislator representing the legal\nprofession   \n\n\n\n \n\n\nFive years after the handover , checks and balances are being lost\nwith a weakening of the legislature  \n\n\n Democracy in recession   \n\n\n Margaret Ng  \n\n \n\n IN LESS THAN  two weeks , the SAR will have\ncompleted its first five years .\n\n\nIn the inevitable review of achievements and failures , one fact will\nhave to be faced: democracy has been weakened in Hong Kong . \n\n \n\nOf course , the obvious should not be denied .\n\n\nThe end of colonial rule must be regarded as a step towards democracy .\n\n\nA chief executive selected among Hong Kong residents must be more\nconsistent with democracy than a governor sent by a distant monarch .\n\n\nBut it must be pointed out that these changes can be more form than\nsubstance . \n\n \n\nAs the \" re-election &rdquo; of Chief Executive Tung\nChee-hwa to a second term of five years clearly demonstrated , the selection\nprocess makes a mockery of democratic election as it is ordinarily understood\n, and a conservative Hong Kong resident chief executive can be more hostile\nto democratisation than an enlightened British governor . \n\n \n\nIt is often said democracy in the Hong Kong context should be\njudged within the framework of the Basic Law and not measured with the\nyardstick of the United States or British models . \n\n \n\nThe Basic Law does provide a democracy of sorts .\n\n\nWhile Hong Kong executive power remains firmly in the hands of the\nBeijing-appointed Chief Executive and principal officials , a real\ndemocratic principle is also enshrined: the executive must abide by law , and\nbe accountable to a widely and locally elected legislature .\n\n\nExecutive power is not democratically exercised , but the exercise of\nexecutive power is democratically held in check . \n\n \n\nThe democratic system under the Basic Law is a system of checks\nand balances .\n\n\nThe powers exercised by Mr Tung and his top officials are subject to\nthe checks and balances of Legco and the courts . \n\n \n\nThus , in the Hong Kong context , the benchmarks of democracy are\nthe effectiveness of Legco in providing political checks and balances , the\nstrength of the rule of law safeguarded by an independent Judiciary , and the\nfull enjoyment of civil liberties by members of the public . \n\n \n\nMeasured against these benchmarks , the situation has decidedly\nworsened .\n\n\nThe \" divide and rule &rdquo; tactic has proved a tool of immense\nvalue to the Government .\n\n\nTheoretically , the Democratic Party has the largest absolute number\nof votes from the electorate and the largest number of seats in Legco , most\nof them directly elected . \n\n \n\nYet the Democratic Party is invariably defeated in any Legco vote\nwhere it opposes the Government .\n\n\nHowever sound or moderate its criticism , and reflective of public\nsentiment , it is defeated . \n\n \n\nWithout a single seat in Legco , the Government has been able to\nforce through any vote it considers important .  \n\n \n\nExamples include the government request for a Basic Law\ninterpretation by the National People  ' s Congress Standing Committee in\nBeijing after it lost its court battle on the first right of abode cases;\nstopping the Public Order Ordinance from being reviewed; and introducing the\nnew ministerial system with extra funding for new posts . \n\n \n\nIt is a safe bet that the controversial legislation to cut civil\nservice pay will also be approved in due course . \n\n \n\nIn each case , there was and is strong opposition .\n\n\nIn each case the Government refused to allow time for consultation .\n\n\nIn the case of the ministerial system , the Government did not bother\nto hide the fact that the proposal was unresolved in essential details and\nhas not been carefully thought out . \n\n \n\nWhen it comes to timely information and explanation regarding\nimportant policy decisions , the Government now deliberately bypasses Legco\nwith little concern .\n\n\nThe latest example is the decision to resume the sale of Home\nOwnership Scheme flats .\n\n\nChief Secretary Donald Tsang Yam-kuen chose to make the announcement\nat a press conference , ignoring Legco . \n\n \n\nWhen an irate House Committee of Legco sought an explanation , Mr\nTsang said the Government would come to Legco first only on \" important\n&rdquo; decisions requiring Legco  ' s support in passing legislation or\napproving financial proposals . \n\n \n\nHe added he avoided putting matters before Legco because members\ntend to be confrontational and make negative comments .\n\n\nThis is atypical only in its unashamed frankness ! \n\n \n\nLooking ahead , the accountability system set to be implemented\non July 1 will not increase Hong Kong  ' s democracy but rather weaken it\nfurther because checks and balances that still exist will be further weakened .\n\n\n \n\nIt is not that there is anything sacrosanct about the archaic\nbureaucratic government model .\n\n\nIt is what the established system is being replaced with . \n\n \n\nDespite its official name , the new accountability system in no\nway increases accountability to Legco as stipulated in the Basic Law or\nexplained to the public . \n\n \n\nUnlike the British system , the appointees have not been elected\ninto the legislature before being named \" ministers\" .\n\n\nUnlike the US system , their appointments are not subject to the\nendorsement of the legislature . \n\n \n\nThey are handpicked by Mr Tung , with Beijing  ' s approval , and\nare answerable only to him .\n\n\nA minister who exercises executive power under the law is\naccountable to the legislature .\n\n\nUnder the ministerial system , all statutory executive powers now\nexercised by officials who are senior civil servants will be transferred to\nthe new ministers .\n\n\nNone of them will be accountable to Legco for the power they will be\nexercising . \n\n \n\nConstitutional Affairs Secretary Michael Suen Ming-yeung has\nrejected any suggestion a minister would resign upon a Legco vote of no\nconfidence . \n\n \n\nThere will be less transparency rather than more .\n\n\nIt is claimed there will be more accountability in that the new\nministers will meet people and hear their views .\n\n\nWhat that will mean is a more invasive propaganda machinery . \n\n \n\nIt is much easier to pull the wool over the eyes of the people\nwho have little time or interest to go into the details than to curb critical\nLegco members whose job is to ask probing questions and demand relevant\ndocuments . \n\n \n\nBypassing Legco and opting for more walkabouts and media chats\nis dodging vigorous scrutiny .\n\n\nThis is to create a more efficient government propaganda machine to\nbe controlled by the future director of the Chief Executive  ' s Office . \n\n \n\nIt has been denied that the civil service has any role in\nrestraining the Government in wielding power and dictating policy . \n\n \n\nWe are told the role of the civil service and Exco is to support\nand assist the Chief Executive .\n\n\nYet any rational being is restrained by independent advice against\nwhat he contemplates doing . \n\n \n\nIn so far as the accountability system is introduced to meet Mr\nTung  ' s need to assert himself as the real boss , it will work to subdue the\ncivil service , not to encourage loyal , frank and independent advice . \n\n \n\nIt is understandable for the Government to resist the criticism\nof Legco out of mistrust .\n\n\nThat is why the critical assessment coming from within the civil\nservice is - or was - so invaluable .\n\n\nWith that factor eliminated , and Legco marginalised , the\nGovernment is poised to rule by the will of Mr Tung and his chosen few . \n\n \n\nThe neutralisation of all checks and balances will not assist\nthe progress of democracy .\n\n\nThe next thing that will follow is to label as democracy what in\nsubstance is plain authoritarianism . \n\n \n\nCivil liberties will be more exposed to curtailment than ever .\n\n\nAlready the process has started . Using a provision in the Public\nOrder Ordinance for the first time , the police recently arrested activist\nLeung Kwok-hung and student leader Christopher Fung Ka-keung at their homes\nfor organising an unlawful assembly , an offence punishable by three years in\njail .\n\n\nThe offence stemmed from deliberate refusal to give the police\nadvance notice of a demonstration as required under the ordinance . \n\n \n\nThe giving of notice on pain of disproportionate penalty was\nstrongly opposed by democrats who urged the Government last year to review\nthe law . \n\n \n\nThe Government countered that the large number of demonstrations\nsince reunification proves civil liberties are even more alive than before ,\nignoring the obvious point that more people demonstrate because more people\nare discontent , not because they are more free to express discontent . \n\n \n\nThe latest police action will make the price of disobedience and\ndefiance much higher . \n\n \n\nThe rule of law was seriously shaken by the interpretation of\nthe Standing Committee in Beijing that overturned the Court of Final Appeal\ndecision on the right of abode .\n\n\nThis can happen again . \n\n \n\nThe requirement under Article 23 of the Basic Law to legislate\nagainst acts of treason , sedition , secession and other offences against the\nstate has been held in abeyance for five years .\n\n\nBut democrats in Legco are being cornered .\n\n\nThe Democratic Party is expected to lose further ground in the next\nLegco election .\n\n\nWith the opposition vanquished , the way will be cleared for the\nintroduction of harsh laws . \n\n \n\n Margaret Ng Ngoi-yee is a legislator representing the legal\nprofession", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f951007e-f127-4d08-8b67-3d255b074efa", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.034120+00:00"}

modem at home , you can download to\nyour own computer , then save to a disk .\n\n\nThat is the easy way to do .\n\n\nUnfortunately that not what you want , right ?\n\n\nIf you want to know this way , send me another mail , I will send more\ninformations on this .\n\n\nSecond way is you are using the computer at U .\n\n\nThat is more difficult than using a PC at home .\n\n\nI will try my best to describe what is going on , but I can't\nguarantee it work .\n\n\nOK , here it  ' s go . \n\n \n\nFirst , enter your account as usual , then go to \" pine\n&rdquo; .\n\n\n  highlight  the mail you want to save in\ndisk .\n\n\nthen type \" \" s \" \" .\n\n\nAt the bottom of the screen , it may ask you if you want to save the\nmail or   something  like that .\n\n\nType in the file name you want the mail to be .\n\n\nThen it will ask you want to   create  a new\nfolder for the new file , then type \" \" y \" \" .\n\n\nThen I think there is a \" \" D \" \" beside\nthe mail you just save .\n\n\nThat mean they will delete that mail .\n\n\nSo when it ask do you want to delete the mail , you type \" n\n&rdquo; because you don't want to lose   your  mail at\nthis point .\n\n\nIf something wrong with the save file , you still have the backup .\n\n\nAfter this , you exit \" pine &rdquo; .\n\n\nSecond thing is to locate your file you just saved .\n\n\nType \" \" cd \" \" to go back to the root\ndirectory .\n\n\nThen type \" \" ls - a \" \" to see if the\nfile you saved is in it .\n\n\nIf it is not , go to \" mail &rdquo; or \" Mail &rdquo;\ndirectory , by   typing  \" \" cd mail\n\" \" or \" \" cd Mail \" \" .\n\n\n\" mail &rdquo; and \" Mail &rdquo; is two different\ndirectory ,\n\n\ndon't mix them up .\n\n\nAfter you have locate your saved file , you may logout to your system\n, but you have to remember what directory of your file located .\n\n\nThat is important ,\n\n\nif you don't remember where it locate , you can't get the file .\n\n\nAfter you logout , go to the main screen of your computer ,\n\n\nI mean the screen that when you first boot up the computer .\n\n\nThat is the problem part because I don't remember what items are on\nthat screen .\n\n\nSo you may have to search for what you need , but the other way is to\nask the help desk on this topic .\n\n\nAlright back to the subject .\n\n\nOne more thing from this point forward ,\n\n\nI just guess what would happen to your screen .\n\n\nI really have no ideas .\n\n\nIf what you see is not what I describe , you have to describe what\nyou saw and send a mail to me as detail as possible .\n\n\nYou have to find \" ftp &rdquo; or \" FTP &rdquo; on the\nscreen .\n\n\nIt usually still in the communication menu .\n\n\nIn communication menu , you may ask to choose \" telnet &rdquo;\nor \" ftp &rdquo; .\n\n\nThen choose \" ftp &rdquo; this time .\n\n\nThen choose the site your file locate like \" hkusub.hku.hk\n&rdquo; .\n\n\nIf you don't find the site you need , try to look for \" other\nsite &rdquo; then type in the site you need .\n\n\nIt may ask you to login , so login as usual telnet account .\n\n\nAfter you are in the account , go to the directory your file located .\n\n\nYou can still use \" cd &rdquo; and \" ls &rdquo; to look\nfor the file .\n\n\nAfter you located your file , type \" \" get filename\n\" \" .\n\n\n\" get &rdquo; is a comment to transfer the file to the   hard drive  .\n\n\n\" filename &rdquo; is the name of your file .\n\n\nThen you have to wait for few seconds or few minutes depend on the\nsize of your file .\n\n\nWhen it finish , it will tell you the file is completely   transferred  or   something\n like that .\n\n\nAfter that you can exit ftp by type \" \" quit \"\n\" .\n\n\nThat will bring you back to the communication menu screen .\n\n\nAfter that you have to go to \" Windows 3.1 &rdquo; .\n\n\nGo to the \" File Manager &rdquo; .\n\n\nYou have to search where is your file locate ,\n\n\nthat   something  I really can't help you .\n\n\nBecause they may have many network drive , my best guess is on the\nroot directory of the first network drive .\n\n\nThat mean the first drive that after the  \nfloppy disk  drive .\n\n\nAfter you locate your file on drive , then highlight the file by\nsingle click the right mouse button on the file .\n\n\nGo to \" \" Edit \" \" menu , choose \"\n\" Copy \" \" .\n\n\nthen it will ask you where you want to save .\n\n\nType \" \" a:\\ \" \" .\n\n\n\" \" a:\\ \" \" is the \n floppy disk  drive name .\n\n\nSo if you want to save to drive b , you will type \" \"\nb:\\ \" \" .\n\n\nAnd that should do it .\n\n\nIf you want to make sure the file is   copied \n, you can right click on the drive to see your file is in it or not .\n\n\nAlso you may want to delete the file you left in the   hard drive  .\n\n\nIf you can't get it to work , my advice is go to ask the help desk .\n\n\nOr you have to send me detail on what you and see on the screen .\n\n\nI know it  ' s a sloppy job , but hope this will help . \n\n Next week is Spring break , so if you read this mail Thursday , and\nreturn me a message on Friday if you find any problem , I may still send you\nsome advice if I have any , before I take the trip to LA .\n\n\nSo wish you luck with your work . \n\n\nDave . \n\n\n\n\nChrista ,\n\n \n\nAbout the computer work , actually what part did you have the\nproblem ,\n\n\nIf you can say it , I may able to fix it .\n\n\nAlso if you did not catch what the people in help desk told you , ask\nthem again .\n\n\nAsk them to slow down , and said you are not experience with computer\n, and what part you did not get right .\n\n\nThey are able to help you again .\n\n\nThey are   paid  to help the students who are\nnot good at computer , so they should have   patience \nto help you .\n\n\nDon't get discourage if you did not get it in the first time . \n\n \n\nAbout your project , I am willing to participate in it .\n\n\nIt seem like very interesting .\n\n\nBut I have one request , I would like to see the result after you\nhave done your analysis .\n\n\nMy age group is 20-25 . \n\n \n\nI am in LA this week , but it is a sad week for me .\n\n\nMy U did poorly in basketball this week .\n\n\nFirst we lost to Arizona State University at home .\n\n\nSecond we lost in the first round in the NCAA tournament .\n\n\nThese really bother me a lot .\n\n\nI can only hope they will do better next year . \n\n \n\nI have   bought  3 CDs in LA .\n\n\nThey are Welcome Back by Pricilla Chan , Just wake up from dream by\nCass Pang , and All time favourite by Shirley Kwan .\n\n\nI would not say anything about these CDs , because I still need some\ntime to listen to it .\n\n\nI have just listen to them once . \n\n \n\nI think I will stop here for this time because I need to some\ntimes to prepare for the   basketball  practice\nthis afternoon .\n\n\nI just came back last night .\n\n\nMost of my things still in the bag .\n\n\nSo talk to you   later  .\n\n\nTake care . \n\n\nDave . \n\n\n\n\nChrista ,\n\n \n\nThere is one thing happen in this week that I did not tell you ,\nor you may already heard before .\n\n\nThere is a rumor that Michael   Jordan  is\ncoming back to play basketball .\n\n\nThis rumor started on last week that he announce that he retired\nfrom baseball , and will practice with Bulls on Monday and Tuesday .\n\n\nThat is the indication of coming back .\n\n\nFinally he announced he will play the rest of the basketball   season  in Bulls started on this Sunday .\n\n\nThe announcement is made on today .\n\n\nI will post you a report after I watch the game tomorrow . \n\n\nLater !\n\n\nDave . \n\n\n\n\nChrista ,\n\n \n\nAs I said before , I will give you some \n information  of Michael Jordan came back from basketball .\n\n\nBulls has played three games after Jordan came back .\n\n\nThey has played Indiana Pacers on road and lost on overtime , played\nBoston Celtics in Boston and won , and finally last night played Orlando\nMagic in new United center at Chicago and lost .\n\n\nBy the way , he was not wearing #23 ,\n\n\nhe is wearing #45 now .\n\n\nThe reason for this because #23 is the number that his father\nsaw him last played .\n\n\nAnd his father was murdered in 1993 before Jordan retirement . \n\n \n\nHere  ' re the details of those games .\n\n\nIn the first game , Jordan has played 43 minutes .\n\n\n7 for 28 field goals , and have 19 points .\n\n\nHe has 3 steals , 6 rebounds , and 6 assists .\n\n\nHis shots were off .\n\n\nAnd he was very tired .\n\n\nThis sign showed in the end of the regular game time ,\n\n\nhe has leg cramp .\n\n\nHe did not have a slam dunk in this game .\n\n\nIn the second game , he only played 26 minutes due to the early\nfouls trouble .\n\n\nHe got 3 fouls in the first 4 or 5 minutes , so he has to sit for\nthe quarter .\n\n\nIn the first few minutes he played in the first quarter , he was 3\nfor 3 in the field , included a 3-pointer .\n\n\nHe got 27 points and 9 for 17 shooting , 1 steals , 3 rebounds , and\n4 assists .\n\n\nThe final score was Bulls 124 , Celtics 107 .\n\n\nThe third game is in United center .\n\n\nThis is the first home game for Bulls after Jordan came back .\n\n\nAlso this is the first game that Jordan play in this building\nbecause United center was open after Jordan retirement .\n\n\nThis meant a lot in Chicago .\n\n\nThe ticket price goes sky high .\n\n\nThis was a real close game .\n\n\nIt could win by either team .\n\n\nThe biggest lead of both teams were 6 to 7 points .\n\n\nAnd it swung back and forth .\n\n\nThe final score was Bulls 99 , and Magic 106 .\n\n\nJordan has 21 points , 7 for 23 shooting , 5 steals , 4 rebounds ,\nand 8 assists .\n\n\nHe still need more time to work on his shot .\n\n\nBut I think his shooting will be back   some day\n before playoff this year .\n\n\nBulls also have a game tonight at Atlanta ,\n\n\nHope they will win .\n\n\n \n\n \n\nI think I will come back to HK on May 20th , so I will miss the\nGrasshopper concert also .\n\n\nThat  ' s sad .\n\n\nIf you can get good seat in Shirley Kwan concert , get me two\ntickets &semi;\n\n\notherwise , just get me one is enough .\n\n\nI think I have no more to say this week because I was so busy\nwatching basketball game and did nothing .\n\n\nSo long . \n\n\nDave . \n\n\n\n\nDear Alyson ,\n\n \n\nI  ' m so glad to receive your letter .\n\n\nThanks for your photos .\n\n\nThey  ' re so nice and beautiful .\n\n\nI  ' m still working in the shipping company but no one knows I  ' m a\nstudent .\n\n\nI  ' ll resign on the 14th of August . \n\n \n\nI  ' ve my A-level result on the 8th of July .\n\n\nMy results were not so good .\n\n\nThe best subject is English .\n\n\nOn the 14th of July , I was accepted by the University of Hong Kong .\n\n\nI  ' ll take English as my major .\n\n\nFor minor subjects , I haven't decided yet .\n\n\nSince the tertiary education is expanding , I  ' m lucky to get a\nplace in the university .\n\n\nIn the past , I won't be accepted by the university as the results\nwere not outstanding . \n\n \n\nI haven't had enough sleep since 26/7 because the Olympic games\nare really very attractive .\n\n\nI won't sleep until 1:00 or 2:00 a.m. every night .\n\n\nI love to watch gymnastics , swimming and diving .\n\n\nWhat about you ?\n\n\nBefore the start of the Olympic , many specialists said that with\nthe split of Soviet Union , the sports standard may be lowered .\n\n\nHowever , the standard of the Unified Team is still very high as\nreviewed by the number of good metals they got . \n\n \n\nThis summer I haven't had enough sport activities since most of\nmy time is occupied by my job .\n\n\nEven there are Sundays and Saturday afternoons , I didn't have a\nchance to enjoy any of my favourite sports .\n\n\nIt is because the squash courts , tennis courts are fully booked .\n\n\nBesides , nearly all the beaches and swimming pools are filled with\npeople .\n\n\nThe water of the swimming pools is terrible ,\n\n\nthey  ' re just like a large bathing pool .\n\n\nI hope after my resign , I  ' ll have more time for sports . \n\n \n\nI think my plan for travelling overseas have to be postponed\nsince after my resign I have to join 2 camps organized by the university .\n\n\nMore than that there are several days for registration and returning\nforms .\n\n\nThree of my good friends will still with me ,\n\n\nI mean study in the University of Hong Kong .\n\n\nOne of my good friends will go into the Chinese University and\nanother one will go into the Polytechnic .\n\n\nThough I  ' ve 3 good friends in the University of Hong Kong , we\nstudy different subjects .\n\n\nTherefore , we have to meet new friends but I  ' m sure we  ' ll still\nbe good friends forever as we have been good friends for over 7 years .\n\n\nWhenever we  ' ve time , we  ' ll meet again . \n\n \n\nThere are Halls for students to stay in the university campus .\n\n\nFor me , I won't apply for room because the places available were\nvery limited and only those very active students get the chances especially\nthose who are good at sports .\n\n\nA trip from home to the university takes 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours , it\nisn't a very long journey , so I decide to study at home . \n\n \n\nHow is you and Alex ?\n\n\nWhat about the Indian guy ?\n\n\nI believe racial discrimination still exist in this world though\npeople always stress on equality .\n\n\n( But I  ' m not saying your parents are racist . )\n\n\n  maybe  at this moment , your parents don't\naccept him as one of your friend but as time pass by , they may change their\nattitude .\n\n\nDon't be upset !\n\n\nThe world is dynamic . \n\n \n\nIn this summer , Batman -; Returning will be on show in H.K .\n\n\nThere is a wave of batman in H.K. especially little children love\n&lsquo; Batman &rsquo; very much .\n\n\nHow about Canada ?\n\n\nO.K.\n\n\nI  ' ve to stop here ,\n\n\nwrite soon ! \n\n\nLove ,\n\n\nChrista\n\n\n6/8/92\n\n\nP.S.\n\n\nI enclosed 3 pictures .\n\n\n2 taken at Stanley Beach ,   1  taken at the\nUniversity of Hong Kong with my friend . \n\n\n\n\nDear Alyson ,\n\n \n\nIt is so glad to receive your letter .\n\n\nIn fact I want to write you a few weeks ago but since I haven't got\nyour new address .\n\n\nI gave up . \n\n \n\nKnowing that you  ' ve been very busy , I don't mind if you didn't\nwrite me .\n\n\nI have been busy since the late Oct , occupying by homeworks and\ntutorials .\n\n\nWell there is a lot to talk about my 1st year university life in H.K .\n\n\nUniversity of H.K. is not so big in area as compare with any\nuniversity elsewhere but I always got my way lost in the first few days and I  ' ve\nto take a map of the campus with me .\n\n\nBesides , many facilities of the university are outside the campus ,\nsuch as the sports centre , student halls , far away from the campus .\n\n\nUsually I take about 1 hr to go to school .\n\n\nI have to take the MTR to Central and then get a change of mini-bus .\n\n\nI remembered that in early Oct. I  ' ve got a traffic accident .\n\n\nLucky I didn't get hurt . \n\n \n\nLet me tell you something about my study .\n\n\nI take 4 courses in each semester .\n\n\nthe subjects that I  ' m taking are : English Studies , Introduction\nto American Studies , Psychology , Sociology and English for Arts students .\n\n\nFor English , I have to study Macbeth &ampersand; Jane Eyre .\n\n\nIt is a bit difficult for me to start since I haven't had any\nknowledge on literature in my secondary school days .\n\n\nSadly to say , I didn't get good marks for my essays .\n\n\nEnglish Studies also include linguistics which I also didn't have\nany experience on it .\n\n\nMoreover , tackling American Studies is an difficult task  of American history and leave the rest for us to look up\nfrom the books suggested .\n\n\nHowever , the suggested readings are always charged by the library .\n\n\n \n\nThis year I have a long Christmas holidays which I never have\nbecause my term break will start on the 14th of Dec and go back to school on\n8th of Jan , 93 . \n\n \n\nApart from the long holidays , there are many other things that\nare different from secondary school .\n\n\nFor example , 90% of my lectures and tutorials are taught by\nforeigners .\n\n\nOne thing I have gained from the university is that I  ' m no longer\nhesitate to speak English since there are no other ways to communicate with\nthem .\n\n\nOne very interesting feature in HKU especially in the English\nDepartment is that many Dr. learn to speak Cantonese .\n\n\nIn addition , I need to make new friends or else I will be lonely in\nthe university .\n\n\nAlthough , I have already got some good friends in the university ,\nusually my former classmates , they study different subjects and we have\nlittle time to meet each other .\n\n\nTo solve the problem of feeling lonely , I make a lot of new friends\nfrom different faculty , different departments and different backgrounds .\n\n\nI got to know these people by joining the student bodies such as\nsocieties and clubs .\n\n\nIn a way , meeting new friends widen my social life and I find it\nvery interesting to meet different kind of people in the university . \n\n \n\nI know that there was an universal suffrage and I still don't\nknow what it is all about .\n\n\nCan you tell me something about the vote ? \n\n \n\nMy brother , starts his secondary life in Sept but he doesn't do\nwell in English dictation especially in times of unseen dictation .\n\n\nI think it will be better for him to learn phonetics .\n\n\nNonetheless , I didn't know much about this subjects .\n\n\nIn the university I have to study phonetics but until now I am very\nconfused and I don't know how to write an essay on phonetics .\n\n\nFor my sister , she is busy with her tests and the public A-level\nexam .\n\n\nFor my mum , she is putting on weight .\n\n\nWe have an old saying \" Getting fat in the middle ages &rdquo; .\n\n\nSince my mum is in her middle ages , she is getting fatter than\nbefore .\n\n\nIn the past she only got about 40kg but now she has got 46kg .\n\n\nWe all remind her to keep a watch on her weight as too fat is not so\ngood for her health . \n\n\nIt is already 1:30a.m .\n\n\nI better stop here .\n\n\nWrite soon !\n\n\nLove ,\n\n\nChrista\n\n\n12/11/92", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "44caefb1-48a6-499d-9986-dfa1e26b8c3b", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.035842+00:00"}

\n\n \n\nI have also encountered a lot of immaturity - the occasional\nteenage boy who thinks it is funny to pretend to be a female Sim .\n\n\nTheir immaturity ususlly betrays them quickly .\n\n\nOne even kicked me out of his house for not handling over money .\n\n\n \n\nThe game is more fun if you are a mature person who enjoys\ntalking and meeting other people .\n\n\nFor parents with children there are security features that parents\ncan set so that no one can talk to the child without parental approval . \n\n\n \n\n The Sims Online  is a great way for social people to\nmeet one other .\n\n\nI can imagine shy people might even come out of their shells as they\ncan meet people behind the safety of a computer screen . \n\n \n\nSome buttons on the interface have not been implemented yet .\n\n\nI am not sure if this means the game is unfinished , but game updates\nseem to take place on a fairly regularly basis .\n\n\nThe last two have required 6.5-megabyte downloads . \n\n \n\nMany of the players I found online were fans of the original Sims\nbut found the online game much more fun .\n\n\nThey love to show off their interior design skills and invite people\nover .\n\n\nThey also love the real-people interaction , as I do . \n\n \n\nBut what do I know ?\n\n\n The Sims  is one of the best-selling games ever .\n\n\nI did not like it .\n\n\n The Sims Online  has not met sales targets , but I am\naddicted . \n\n \n\n Any questions or requests on games ?\n\n\nE-mail Peter at gameguy_scmp@hotmail.com  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Mix-and-match animal rivals make losing fun   \n\n\n Preview   \n\n\n Impossible Creatures   \n\n\nPeter Lau \n\n \n\n Developer:  Relic Entertainment/Microsoft \n\n \n\n Web Site: \nwww.microsoft.com/games/impossiblecreatures \n\n \n\n Pros:  Creative , new real-time strategy with a\ntwist \n\n \n\n Cons:  Not enough players online \n\n \n\n Price:  HK&dollar;250 \n\n \n\nRelic Entertainment  ' s first game ,  Homeworld  , was a\nfantastic debut and garnered rave reviews .\n\n\nNow , Relic is back and bringing some impossible creature with it .\n\n\n \n\n Impossible Creatures  is a real-time strategy game that\nfinally moves away from the common historical and space themes and into the\nrealm of bio-science . \n\n \n\nThe game is set in 1937 , so the technologies are powered by two\nresources - coal and electricity .\n\n\nAn eccentric scientist provides just enough out-of-the-box thinking\nto create the technology that allows you to combine the characteristics of\ntwo animals . \n\n \n\nBy mixing and matching characteristics from two animal types ,\nyou can create impossible creatures with which to wage war .  \n\n \n\nAnimal anatomy is broken down into seven possible sections: head\n, torse , front legs , back legs , tail , wings and pincers . \n\n \n\nI combined a wolverine with an armadillo to create a \"\nwolverdillo\" , my thinking being that the front legs and head of the\nwolverine would give my creaure a vicious bite and the shell of the armadillo\nwould give it a good defence when fighting up close . \n\n \n\nBy clicking on the different parts of the anatomy , I can choose\nif I want , say , the head to come from the wolverine or the armadillo . \n\n \n\nAnother of my creations copied the mythological flying snake .\n\n\nIt had the wings of an owl and the body of a snake .\n\n\nBest of all , it spat acid ! I also combined a coyote and a frog to\ncreate a \" coyrog &rdquo; and a wolf and a lobster to create a \"\nwobster\" . \n\n \n\nCreating impossible creatures is great fun , and I spent loads of\ntime just mixing and matching different animals . \n\n \n\nThe possibilities are endless and make for hours of fun .\n\n\nWith so many combinations to play with , many games are spent\nwondering: \" What is that thing ?\n\n\nIt  ' s killing me ! &rdquo; \n\n \n\nOnce you have created your impossible creature , you can store\nthe blueprint .\n\n\nYou can also build any creature from your library during combat .\n\n\n \n\nThere are pre-built libraries , but they are not half as much fun\nas fighting your opponent with your own creations . \n\n \n\nYour creature types can be upgraded by building a workshop .\n\n\nUsing the workshop , you can upgrade a creature  ' s attacks , movement\nand defence .\n\n\nClaws can be made made longer and sharper . Poison spit can become\nmore corrosive . \n\n \n\nAs its animalistic heart , though ,  Impossible Creatures\n is still a real-time strategy game .\n\n\nYou still gather resources to power your buildings and create your\ncreatures .\n\n\nMore powerful creatures are accessible once you upgraded your\nbuildings and , as with other real-time strategy games , baddest units\nusually wins . \n\n \n\nIt is undoubtedly a lot of fun to see how your invented creatures\nfare against the inventions of other players .\n\n\nUnfortunately , I  ' m not finding a great many players online , so you\nmay have to bring your own friends to the party . \n\n \n\nGraphically , the engine is one of the best I have seen .\n\n\nThe ability to smoothly rotate and zoom from any angle is a Relic\nhallmark .\n\n\nThe campaign is your usual fare , with some good production values\nbut average overall . \n\n \n\nThe mood and setting are different from  Homeworld  .\n\n\n Impossible Creatures  is cartoonish and carefree , whereas\n Homeworld  is serious and sombre . \n\n \n\nRelic is quickly building a reputation for developing creative\nreal-time strategy games with a twist .\n\n\nWith  Homeworld  , it created a fully 3D space , with \nImpossible Creatures  , the twist is the ability easily to create your\nown customized army and see how it fares , never sure what enemies you are\ngoing to face . \n\n \n\nI thoroughly enjoy  Impossible Creatures  .\n\n\nEach defect drives me back to the lab to experiment with creating new\nmonstrosities .\n\n\nI  ' ve never been so much fun losing ! \n\n \n\n Any questions or requests on games , e-mail Peter at\ngameguy_scmp@hotmail.com  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  GADGET MAGIC  \n\n\n  Feature-packed devices fuel quest for longer life \n\n\n\n  Focus of hi-tech research is on finding alternatives to\nnickel cadmium batteries  \n\n\n CAROLYN ONG  \n\n\n  Colour-display devices such as the Smartphone Qtek 7070\nhave short battery lives . Packing more features into devices worsens the\nproblem .  Picture by Edward Wong   \n\n\n\n Research In Motion introduced its first colour-screen BlackBerry handheld\nlast week . \n\n\n\n Not only is the device streets behind the competition when it comes to\nfeatures , it is expensive .\n\n\nExpected to cost nearly HK&dollar;6,000 , the new BlackBerry 7230 is\na technological dinosaur compared with many products from Palm ,\nSony-Ericsson and Nokia . \n\n\n\n BlackBerry fans have in the past argued that a colour display is a\nnice-to-have , rather than a must-have , feature that drains batteries . \n\n\n\n They are prepared to live without it because having a longer battery life\nis more important . \n\n\n\n They have a good point .\n\n\nMany colour devices , such as the Microsoft Smartphone QTek 7070 ,\nhave dismally short battery life. \n\n\n\n In addition to juice-sapping features like a colour display and\nbacklighting , wireless functions such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi , games ,\nWeb-browsing , digital cameras and multimedia messaging use up power quickly .\n\n\n\n\n The QTek lasts about five hours with normal phone usage , some game\nplaying and some multimedia messaging .\n\n\nHandsets should ideally last eight to 12 hours without a recharge .\n\n\n\n\n Today  ' s most advanced mobile phones are more computer than phone .\n\n\nTop-of-the-line models from Nokia , Sony-Ericsson , Samsung and\nMotorola have e-mail , embedded digital cameras , Bluetooth , games and\nstereo sound . \n\n\n\n Combination devices such as Palm  ' s Tungsten W or O2  ' s xDA have larger\ncolour displays and are jammed with more applications , requiring even more\npower. \n\n\n\n The problem of battery life has long dogged portable devices .\n\n\nLimited battery life is one of the main complaints of users of\nlaptops , personal digital assistants and mobile phones . \n\n\n\n At the same time , consumers continue to demand more from these devices ,\nwhich in turn requires manufacturers to incorporate applications that consume\neven greater amounts of power . \n\n\n\n While battery technologies have made big strides in the past 15 years ,\neven the best , such as lithium-ion cells , only power one to two hours of\nheavy use . \n\n\n\n Device makers face weight constraints when it comes to batteries .\n\n\nThey have to be small and light enough not to add substantial bulk ,\nand they must be able to last a while between recharges . \n\n\n\n Some devices come with power management software that extends battery\nlife by up to 20 per cent by putting infrequently used functions on standby\nor disabling them .\n\n\nSome devices use low-power chips from Intel and Transmeta . \n\n\n\n If you are working in a well-lit room , you can reduce screen brightness\nto save power .\n\n\nSmall measures such as these can conserve an hour or two of battery\npower . \n\n\n\n Consumer electronics companies such as Sony , Sanyo and NEC are doing a\nlot of research on extending battery life and looking for alternatives to\nnickel cadmium batteries that power most portable electronic devices . \n\n\n\n Several technology start-ups in the United States are racing to produce\nthe first commercial fuel cell for portable products , potentially a\nmultibillion-dollar business .\n\n\nMany are working on methane-powered fuel cells , already used in\nsome cars . \n\n\n\n Motorola demonstrated a methane-powered fuel cell for mobile phones in\n2001 .\n\n\nThe cell is a little longer and thicker than the average mobile\nphone , and stores methane in an area the size of a ballpoint pen  ' s ink\nholder .\n\n\nA chemical reaction releases oxygen , heat and electricity .\n\n\nThe electricity then either powers the device directly or charges\nanother battery . \n\n\n\n While Motorola has yet to roll out a commercial product , methanol fuel\ncells are expected to power laptops and mobile phones in two years , maybe\nless . \n\n\n\n NEC is working on a methanol cell , expected to be in production by 2005\nat the latest , that will give 10 times more power per weight than\nlithium-ion at the same cost .\n\n\nIf successful , NEC  ' s new fuel cells will be able to power mobile\nphones for weeks without a recharge . \n\n\n\n A highly flammable liquid , methanol overcame an obstacle last year when\nit was approved by the US Department of Transportation for use on board\nflights . \n\n\n\n PolyFuel , one of a handful of start-ups focused on developing fuel cells\nfor portable devices , demonstrated a hot-swappable , recycleable fuel\ncartridge for laptops at the Intel Developers Forum in February .\n\n\nThe fuel cell could give 10 hours of continuous power .\n\n\nPolyFuel expects to bring the product to market next year . \n\n\n\n  Got a gadget idea ?\n\n\nDrop Carolyn a line at carolyn@scmp.com  . \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Firm hails revolution of 3D heart technology  \n\n\n\n An American manufacturer has arrived in Hong Kong to promote new\ntechnology that allows physicians to see a beating human heart as a\ntransparent , three-dimensional image , saying it could improve patients'\nchances of survival . \n\n\n\n According to cardiologist Joseph Kisslo , of Duke University Medical\nCentre in the United States , the new ultrasound machine can turn average\nheart surgeons into world class physicians by helping them diagnose and treat\nthe disease more efficiently . \n\n\n\n Using the machines , which have been in research and development for\nabout 20 years and cost &dollar;2.3 million each , cardiologists can get a\nbetter view of a heart  ' s valves and chambers and can view the transparent\nimage from different angles using a computer mouse . \n\n\n\n Ultrasound machines , which are non-intrusive , use sounds to create an\nimage of an internal organ .\n\n\nUntil now , physicians have relied on chest X-rays and\ntwo-dimensional ultrasound machines to diagnose heart disease .\n\n\n\" We can bring the best surgery to more people because we\nsimplify everything , &rdquo; Dr Kisslo said . \n\n\n\n \" Now you get the whole story in just one picture .\n\n\nIt gives a better picture and makes us doctors more equal . &rdquo;\n\n\n\n\n Philips Medical Systems launched its product in Hong Kong yesterday and\nhopes to sell it to both private and public hospitals .\n\n\nIt has sold about 100 to hospitals in the US since launching the\nmachines last November . \n\n\n\n Heart disease is the number two cause of death in Hong Kong , behind\ncancer , and has been steadily claiming more lives each year . \n\n\n\n According to the most recent figures available from the Department of\nHealth , in the year 2000 about 5,537 people died from heart disease , a rise\nfrom 4,806 in 1997 . \n\n\n\n Dr Kisslo said: \" Heart disease is clearly on the rise

\n\n \n\nNewBay is in talks with several European and United States\ncarriers to implement FoneBlog . \n\n \n\nMeanwhile , ucp morgen , based in Vienna , has launched\nmobileblog ! , targeted at operators . \n\n \n\nThe product is deployed on ucp  ' s youth-orientated mobile content\nportal , and offers the same instant publishing capabilities as FoneBlog .\n\n\n \n\nUcp chief executive officer Christian Lutz claims 5.5 million\nusers are blogging on uboot.com , resulting in more than 100 million blogs\nand hundreds of thousands of photos . \n\n \n\nAllowing photos taken by mobile phones to be published in the\npublic domain offers intriguing possibilities . \n\n \n\nAlready , news organisations such as the BBC are equipping their\nreporters with camera phones to cover breaking events , such as the recent\nanti-war protests . \n\n \n\nA number of Asian operators , including Hutchison Telecom ,\nSunday Communications and Peoples Telephone in Hong Kong , offer services\nthat allow subscribers to store photos online . \n\n \n\nNokie  ' s Club Nokie and Samsung  ' s Funzone portals , both\navailable in Hong Kong , have online photo album services for customers .\n\n\nThese are personal pages , however , and can be shared with others\nonly through the use of a password . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Firms looking to slash costs hire outside experts  \n\n\n\n External management frees up companies from the hassle and\nexpense of dealing day-to-day with multiple vendors   \n\n\n Tony Chan  \n\n \n\nThere are numerous reasons why corporations look to outsource\ntheir information technology infrastructure to professional services\norganisations , but none is more pronounced than cost . \n\n \n\nIn this tough economic climate , outsourcing internal IT systems\ncan save as much as 40 per cent on IT capital expenditure , says Fujitsu Hong\nKong  ' s general manager - managed services , information systems &ampersand; services\ndivision , Toby Tsang Kwok-hing . \n\n \n\n\" We can achieve savings of 10 per cent to 20 per cent\neasily in the first year .\n\n\nDepending on the existing IT system and how it was managed in the\nfirst place , we can achieve as much as 30 per cent to 40 per cent savings\nover a reasonable amount of time , &rdquo; Mr Tsang said . \n\n \n\nIn addition to saving money , IT outsourcing offers intangible\nbenefits for corporate management and end-users . \n\n \n\nBy outsourcing IT purchasing and maintenance to companies such as\nFujitsu , corporations eliminate the complexity of having to manage ongoing\nrelationships with multiple vendors . \n\n \n\n\" For large corporations , there can be hundreds of\ncontracts with different IT vendors that need to be monitored and renewed at\nregular intervals .\n\n\nThe process is so complex it often requires a couple of full-time\nstaff to manage internally . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nBy outsourcing their IT system to Fujitsu , corporations will be\nleft with one contract to deal with .\n\n\nCorporations also benefit from the economy-of-scale enjoyed by major\nIT outsourcing providers . \n\n \n\n\" Because Fujitsu is handling the purchasing for multiple\ncompanies , we can leverage the size of our purchasing power to negotiate\nbetter prices , service responses and so on , &rdquo; Mr Tsang said . \n\n \n\nEnd-users on a corporate intranet can benefit from IT outsourcing\n, which typically results in a professionally run IT system , with less\ndowntime and better response time in case of problems . \n\n \n\nBut lowering cost is not the only reason companies are turning to\nIT outsourcing .\n\n\nA growing number of Hong Kong companies are looking to IT outsourcing\nto improve their competitiveness . \n\n \n\nMartin Chan , senior vice-president , PCCW Business eSolutions ( \nHK ) , outsourcing &ampersand; managed services , said: \" The main driver for IT\noutsourcing for companies is to improve their competitiveness in the face of\ncost restraints .\n\n\nCorporations are starting to realise other critical benefits , such\nas the ability to focus on their core business , faster time to market and\naccess to professional skill sets . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nWithout outsourcing , a company looking to introduce new\napplications and services to improve competitiveness must equip staff with\nnew skills or hire staff with those skills , which often delay the launch of\nthose services or require more management resources to get the job done .\n\n\n \n\n\" Outsourcing the implementation of those new applications\nand services to a professional services organisation allows the company to\naccess the latest technical expertise quickly and cost effectively so they\ncan focus on their core business , &rdquo; Mr Chan said .\n\n\nService vendors such as PCCW now allow companies to try new\napplications before they make an investment in the systems . \n\n \n\n\" One of the biggest benefits of outsourcing is it allows\ncorporations to access the latest technology at very low risk .\n\n\nInstead of buying the application , installing it and managing it ,\nwe can offer companies a chance to try out the latest applications before\nthey have to make the investment for those systems . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nAnother emerging trend is companies are looking to cut cost and\nrestructure their cost . \n\n \n\n\" Many corporations are now taking the money they have\nsaved through outsourcing their IT systems to invest in new systems and\napplications that boost their overall business . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nBecause outsourcing contracts actually help spread the cost of\nnew investments over an extended period , corporations have the flexibility\nto invest in new systems earlier . \n\n \n\nWithout outsourcing , a company implementing a new IT system will\nhave to come up with the whole investment at the start of the implementation\ncycle .\n\n\nBy spreading that initial investment over the span of an outsourcing\ncontract , corporations free up financial resources that can be invested in\nother areas . \n\n \n\nMr Tsang said the war in Iraq would boost demand for disaster\nrecovering services in the IT outsourcing sector . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n IT outsourcing firms gear up for a wave of demand  \n\n\n\n Multinationals arriving in China turn to outside experts for\nfast , economical set-ups   \n\n\n Tony Chan  \n\n \n\nChina  ' s entry into the World Trade Organisation is expected to\nspur a boom in information technology outsourcing services in both Hong Kong\nand the mainland . \n\n \n\nAs the amount of foreign investment increases , IT outsourcing\nfirms are gearing up for a wave of demand for wholesale outsourcing services .\n\n\n \n\n\" New multinational corporations entering China will\nrequire outsourcing as a way to set up their business quickly and without\nconsiderable initial capital investment , &rdquo; said Victor Wang , general\nmanager of managed services , HP Services , Hong Kong . \n\n \n\nMr Wang said it could take months for companies without existing\noffices in China to set up support infrastructure . \n\n \n\n\" With HP  ' s outsourcing solution , that telephone line ,\nplus a laptop computer configured for the Internet , could be waiting for the\nfirst project manager who arrives in China , &rdquo; Mr Wang said . \n\n \n\nHis message is echoed by all the major IT outsource providers ,\nincluding Electronic Data Systems (  EDS ) , IBM , Fujitsu and Hong Kong  ' s\nPCCW , which is increasingly looking to capitalise on the growth north of the\nborder . \n\n \n\nThe demand for outsourcing services is also growing as pre-WTO\ninvestment incentives are removed to make way for international standards of\ncompetition . \n\n \n\nIn the past , favourable investment terms such as tax incentives\nand import tax exemptions gave companies a time cushion to generate returns\nand freed them to spend on IT . \n\n \n\nThis is no longer the case . \n\n \n\n\" Without those incentives , foreign firms need to get to\nmarket as soon as possible and with the least amount of initial investment ,\n&rdquo; Mr Wang said . \n\n \n\n\" Outsourcing their IT and non-core operations now makes\nsense to them . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nBenjamin Wong , vice-president , Greater China and Korea , at EDS\nElectronic Data System , said large domestic organisations in China  ' s\nbanking , government and telecoms sectors were also increasingly aware of the\nbenefits of outsourcing . \n\n \n\nHe said large Chinese corporations were already engaging\nconsultancy services in an effort to improve their competitiveness and to\nadopt new services , such as credit cards . \n\n \n\nWith little local experience in these sectors , outsourcing was\nthe only way for Chinese financial institutions to access valuable industry\nskills and learn from international best practices , Mr Wong said . \n\n \n\nThe September 11 terrorist attacks and the war in Iraq have led\nto a growing demand for disaster recovering services in the IT outsourcing\nsector , according to Toby Tsang Kwok-hing , general manager for managed\nservices , at Fujitsu Hong Kong  ' s information systems and services unit .\n\n\n \n\n\" We have had a lot of inquiries about disaster recovery\nsystems since 9/11 , &rdquo; Mr Tsang said . \n\n \n\n\" More and more companies are now aware of the need for\ndisaster recovery . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nHundreds of millions of dollars of IT equipment and the data on\nthem was wiped out in the tragedy , leaving companies scrambling to recover\ntheir corporate data . \n\n \n\nWith the war in Iraq and the sense of foreboding that terrorist\nretaliation is only a matter of time , companies are turning to vendors such\nas Fujitsu to ensure that their corporate data will survive any potential\nattacks . \n\n \n\nLooking forward , China is poised to become a major base for\noutsourcing services . \n\n \n\nMr Tsang said China  ' s entry into the WTO would bring increased\ncompetition in essential support services such as telecommunications , which\nwould lower the overall cost of operating in China . \n\n \n\nCombined with lower import tax on equipment such as computer\nhardware under its WTO obligations , this could turn China into the prime\nlocation for infrastructure such as data or call centres , Mr Tsang said .\n\n\n \n\nDespite its potential , China also presents challenges for IT\noutsourcing providers . \n\n \n\nWhile programmers and engineers are relatively easy to find ,\nmore experienced talent is hard to come by and even harder to retain . \n\n \n\n\" Low-level programmers and engineers are easily available\nbut higher-level systems architects and analysts are still in short supply ,\n&rdquo; Mr Wong said . \n\n \n\nMr Wang added: \" What happens is that we invest in the\nperson and train him or her to our standards , then someone hires them at\nseveral times the salary .\n\n\nIt is hard to compete . &rdquo;  \n\n\n FLEXIBLE VENDOR OFFERS CLIENTS A PAY-AS-YOU-USE SERVICE\n \n\n \n\n Vendors of information technology outsourcing are adopting\nmore fluid price models that approach the pay-as-you-use system of utility\nservice providers .  \n\n \n\n HP  ' s managed services division allows its customers to\npay for only the resources they use instead of entering a rigid contract that\ncannot adapt to their changing needs .  \n\n \n\n \" Today  ' s business environment changes all the time .\n\n\nWe cannot expect our customers not to change , &rdquo; said Victor\nWang , general manager , managed services , HP Services Hong Kong . \n\n\n \n\n While typical outsourcing contracts extend for years on a\npre-negotiated price , HP now offers its customers the option of readjusting\ntheir payment on a quarterly basis depending on the amount of resources they\nuse .  \n\n \n\n \" We are trying to find the exact match for demand ,\n&rdquo; Mr Wang said .  \n\n \n\n For example , customers paying for a two-hour response\ntime as part of their service level agreement (  SLA ) might only need a\nfour-hour response time due to improved systems quality .\n\n\nIn this case , HP would allow their clients to re-adjust their SLAs\nto reduce their IT outsourcing fees , he said .  \n\n \n\n At the same time , HP offers companies flexibility when\ndeveloping new systems . Customers can request new equipment , such as a\nlaptop computer , using this pricing scheme .  \n\n \n\n \" IT outsourcing is now like a utility .\n\n\nCorporations can now use just what they need and they pay for only\nwhat they use , &rdquo; Mr Wang said .  \n\n \n\n HP will even reduce fees if a company no longer requires\nas many services .  \n\n \n\n \" It might sound computer-intuitive , but this way\nwe succeed because we help our customers succeed in what they are doing . It  ' s\na win-win situation , &rdquo; Mr Wang said .  \n\n \n\nTony Chan \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Mature markets offer added value   \n\n\n Tony Chan   \n\n \n\n Atos Origin Hong Kong  ' s Witman Hung says value-based\noutsourcing can help a customer improve profitability and time to market .\n\n\n\nPhoto: Ricky Chung \n\n \n\nCompanies looking for more than a basic outsourcing partner to\nhandle their information technology requirements can choose a new methodology\nin engaging service providers . \n\n \n\nValue-based outsourcing is gaining popularity in mature markets\nsuch as Australia , where about 25 per cent of new outsourcing contracts are\nin this category . \n\n \n\nHong Kong companies can now expect outsourcing providers to be\naccountable for the products and services they provide . \n\n \n\nValue-based outsourcing incorporates a new dynamic pricing\nstructure that is partly determined by measuring the value of the services\nprovided to a customer  ' s business performance . \n\n \n\nValue-based outsourcing is a break from the conventional model\nof simple cost-based pricing for outsourcing services , says Atos Origin\nHong Kong general manager Witman Hung .\n\n\n\" Traditionally , customers want to drive the cost down and\nthe service level up , &rdquo; Mr Hung said . \n\n \n\n\" What happens is the service provider goes in and offers\na price which they feel can cover the cost of providing a certain service\nlevel , plus a margin so they can make some money . \n\n \n\n\" But then the motivation for the service provider is to\nprovide the minimum service level at the lowest cost .\n\n\nThere is no incentive to improve the service level . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nWith this model , \" you get what you pay for , nothing\nmore , nothing less\" . \n\n \n\nThe proposition of value-based outsourcing to business is simple .\n\n\nValue-based outsourcing offers all the benefits of having a reliable\nand efficient IT outsourcing partner and one that will take interest in\nimproving critical business metrics such as profitability , time-to-market\nand overall productivity . \n\n \n\nA typical value-based outsourcing deal would include a basic fee\nfor the standard outsourcing service and clearly defined business objectives\nas a result of the partnership . \n\n \n\nThese can be as simple as a guarantee for systems uptime beyond\na bare minimum . \n\n \n\nFor example , the contractual fee is based on a guarantee uptime\nof 98 per cent , but the service provider gets an extra bonus for achieving\nmore than 99 per cent uptime on a consistent basis . \n\n \n\nMore complex deals can go as far as calculating productivity\ngains , whereby the outsourcing provider guarantees a minimum productivity\nlevel and receives a small fee for every unit produced thereafter . \n\n \n\n\" What we are saying is to add some incentive for the\noutsource provider so there is a reason to improve the service level ,\n&rdquo; Mr Hung said . \n\n \n\n\" So , if we can help a customer improve their\nprofitability , improve their time to market by deploying new systems , or\nnew tools , then we get a bonus for doing so .\n\n\nIt is the same as employee reward schemes . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe new approach is particularly important in today  ' s rapidly\nevolving technology , where new systems can offer significant performance\nimprovements , hence competitive advantages , with each upgrade . \n\n \n\n\" With value-based outsourcing in place , the service\nprovider will have an incentive to invest in new systems and the customers\nreap the benefits - it  ' s a win-win situation . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe obvious complexity of such a relationship means value-based\noutsourcing does not suit every company . \n\n \n\nIt often takes months to build up a working relationship with a\ncustomer and more months of negotiations and due diligence to understand the\nbusiness goals of the customer . \n\n \n\n\" We are only offering the value-based outsourcing model\nto a select number of customers who we feel we can have a long term\nrelationship with , &rdquo; Mr Hung said .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f3bf74b7-8c57-484e-a490-3410ad36918c", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.039307+00:00"}
{"text": "Structural anomalies  \n\n \n\nThere has been a fair amount of published research on Hong\nKong-specific learner errors .\n\n\nHowever , compared with the availability of numerous handbooks on\ncommon errors intended largely for &lsquo; popular consumption &rsquo; ,\nempirical research on errors made by Chinese ESL learners and pedagogically\noriented error-correction materials are scanty .\n\n\nYip ( 1995 ) is one notable exception .\n\n\nDrawing on insights from both Universal Grammar and language typology\n, Yip ( 1995 ) is a systematic study of Chinese interlanguage\n( CIL ) - a relatively stable grammar which has its own\nproperties and internal logic but which falls short of target language norms .\n\n\nHer study is based on mainly production data -; written\ncompositions , oral reports , casual conversations -; of 20 Chinese ESL\nlearners ( 10 intermediate and 10 advanced learners ) mostly\nfrom Taiwan , who were typically recent arrivals in the United States .\n\n\nGrammaticality judgement questionnaires were also used to tap into the\ngrammatical competence of the learners &lsquo; interlanguage .\n\n\nFour CIL structures were studied in detail :  \n\n \n\nWhile pseudo-passives and existential pseudo-relatives refer to\nfaulty constructions which are more appropriately expressed using a passive\n( e.g., \"  Erhu can be played like this  \"\n) and relative structure ( e.g., \"  There were many\npassengers who died in the accident  \" ) , respectively\n, sentences with pseudo-tough movement as in ( c ) refer to\nconstructions which cannot be expressed using the tough-movement structure\nsuch as \"  English is difficult to learn  \" .\n\n\nErgative constructions , on the other hand , involve the\ninappropriate passivization of ergative verbs which can be used both\ntransitively and intransitively , including the passivization of verbs which\nshould only be used intransitively . \n\n \n\nAmong the key findings in Yip ( 1995 ) are the\nobservations that both transfer from L1 and universal developmental features\nin language acquisition are attested , and that the degree of learnability of\na target language hinges on and may be explained by systematic structural\ncontrasts between Ll and L2 .\n\n\nWhile a significant contribution to the literature on interlanguage\nresearch in SLA , Yip ( 1995 ) makes it clear that pedagogical\nimplications will not be discussed in her study .\n\n\nAlthough the erroneous constructions she scrutinized were largely\nderived from a study of Mandarin-speaking ESL learners , our own observations\nsuggest that her data was comparable to syntactically deviant constructions\nmade by Cantonese-speaking ESL learners in Hong Kong . \n\n \n\nApart from Yip ( 1995 ) , to our knowledge CIL has\nnot yet been subjected to large-scale , systematic investigation .\n\n\nIn those studies which do involve CIL , errors are typically based on\nlimited data ( e.g. , Jones , 1980; Lay , 1975; Rutherford , 1983\n) or they are secondary in focus in many theoretical studies in SLA\n( e.g. , Schachter , 1974 ) .\n\n\nConsequently , little is known about how Chinese ESL learners ,\nespecially adults , acquire English and other foreign languages in Chinese\ncommunities ( see Wong , 1988 , for a critical if somewhat dated\nreview of selected research concerning the learning difficulties of English\nby Chinese speakers ) .\n\n\nThe comparative lack of research in SLA involving Chinese learners is\nall the more marked given the fact that native speakers of Chinese make up\nthe largest group of ESL learners today ( Cortazzi &ampersand; Jin ,\n1996 ) .\n\n\nThere is thus a need to investigate systematically how Chinese\nlearners acquire English , what difficulties they encounter , and what errors\nthey make at different stages of the learning process .\n\n\nIn addition to the practical objective of helping ESL teachers\ndeliver quality error-correction feedback , it is believed that research on\nHong Kong-specific CIL will inform SLA theories by filling some information\ngaps that involve the acquisition of English by learners from a typologically\ndistant L1 background such as Cantonese .  \n\n\n Misuse of words  \n\n \n\nApart from rule-governed structural anomalies , many of the\naccuracy problems may be explained by substandard mastery of content words ,\nespecially verbs , nouns and adjectives , in that order .\n\n\nResearch in the past two decades has shown that second language\nvocabulary plays a much more important role than was previously thought to be\nthe case , and therefore should not be disregarded ( e.g. , Carter\n&ampersand; McCarthy , 1991 &semi; Coady &ampersand; Huckin , 1997 &semi;\nHuckin et al. , 1993; Nation , 1990 &semi; Richards , 1976 ) .\n\n\nIn particular , research has shown that accuracy of language use may\nbe significantly improved with the mastery of the correct usage of the\nvocabulary item .\n\n\nIt is in this sense that Gairns &ampersand; Redman ( 1986\n) speak of the &lsquo; grammar of vocabulary &rsquo; .\n\n\nTypical examples include the misuse of verb transitivity or confusion\nbetween noun and verb forms ( e.g. , \"  &asterisk; to\nemphasise on something  \" , <mention  <It> > &asterisk to\ndiscuss about something  \" ) , preposition ( e.g.\n, \"  &asterisk to walk under the sun  \" ) ,\nor plural form of an uncountable noun ( e.g. , \" \n&asterisk we need more informations and equipments  \" ) .\n\n\nThis insight helps justify why for local ESL teachers , curriculum\nwriters and syllabus designers , a separate , pedagogically sound word-based\ntaxonomy will be a useful complement to the conventional structure-based\ntaxonomy . \n\n \n\nA survey of a number of relevant works on ESL errors , error\nanalysis and crosslinguistic influence involving Hong Kong Chinese learners\nshows that these works fall into two main types : ( a )\nscholarly work appearing in journal articles , and ( b ) books\non common errors .\n\n\nMost scholarly work in these areas appears in publications of\nacademic departments of local universities , while specialist volumes on\ncommon errors are meant to be for reference of local learners and teachers of\nEnglish who make up the main target readers .\n\n\nBelow we will briefly review these two types of literature .  \n\n\n Review of local research on ESL errors   \n\n\n Brief review of scholarly work on ESL errors in Hong Kong\n \n\n \n\nPerhaps the most conspicuous attempt to explore local ESL errors\nsystematically and to assess their impact on teaching and learning is to be\nfound in the second special issue of <It> Institute of Language in Education\nJournal  ( ILEJ ) edited by David Bunton and Christopher\nGreen ( 1991 ) .\n\n\nIt contains seven papers covering a wide range of related issues ,\nfrom Bunton  ' s ( 1991 ) study assessing the distinctiveness of\nHong Kong-specific errors vis-a-vis errors obtained in an international error\nsample ( Heaton &ampersand; Turton , 1987 ) , to Green  ' s\n( 1991b ) survey of teachers  '  perceptions of &lsquo; error\ngravity &rsquo; , which has a direct bearing on the grading of student\ncompositions .\n\n\nBunton  ' s ( 1991 ) findings show that only 108 (\nor 26.7 percent ) of the 404 Hong Kong errors as stated in his\n( 1989 ) book are actually represented in the international\nsample , suggesting that the majority of the errors are distinct to Hong Kong\nChinese ESL learners , of which the clearest examples are the lexical\nmisselection , semantic mismatch and inappropriate collocation .\n\n\nMany other structural errors are compared in his study . \n\n \n\nFour other studies in the ILEJ volume make reference to local ESL\nerrors .\n\n\nNewbrook ( 1991b ) critiques a number of locally\nproduced &lsquo; guides to English usage &rsquo; ( see below )\n, most of which were written by Hong Kong Chinese .\n\n\nChan ( 1991 ) analyses errors involving the misuse of\ntransitive verbs and passive construction found in 156 compositions of Form 6\nstudents , and concludes that these two types of errors are probably due to\nnegative transfer from Cantonese .\n\n\nSung ( 1991 ) adopts a cross-sectional design to elicit\nwritten English output from 30 students of varying proficiency levels .\n\n\nThe results seem to lend support to the hypotheses that ( a\n) typological transfer of topic-comment structure so commonly found in\nChinese varieties is attested , especially those with lower proficiency of\nEnglish , and ( b ) learners with higher proficiency levels\ntend to produce sentences with subject-predicate structure in accordance with\nnorms of standard English , suggesting an interlanguage continuum along which\nthe topic-comment structure gradually gives way to the more normative\nsubject-predicate structure of English as the learner progresses to a higher\nproficiency level . \n\n \n\nThe last of the four studies ( Webster &ampersand; Lam ,\n1991 ) in the above-mentioned ILEJ volume is a follow-up study of\nWebster et al. ( 1987 ) .\n\n\nBased on written work by students , interviews with students and a\nquestionnaire survey with ESL teachers at the British Council , Webster et\nal. ( 1987 ) present local ESL errors at various levels : from\nmorphology , lexis , syntax to discourse .\n\n\nIn Webster &ampersand; Lam ( 1991 ) , some of these\nissues are clarified and extended , and a few misused verbs such as \"\n suggest  \" , \"  help  \" ,\n\"  change  \" and \"  send \n\" are included .\n\n\nOf theoretical interest in these two papers is that the authors\nattribute the errors , though not exclusively , to mother-tongue influence\n( cf. Chan , 1991; Sung , 1991 ) , including the slightly odd\nwarning found ubiquitously in public places apparently translated from\nChinese : \"  When there is a fire , do not use the lift \n\" , where the use of \"  when  \" in\nstandard English , according to the authors , would suggest that a fire , or\neven several fires , <It> will  take place at some unspecified time\nlater ( Webster &ampersand; Lam , 1991 , pp. 36f ) . \n\n \n\nElsewhere , Newbrook ( 1988 ) explores typical\nerrors in relative clauses .\n\n\nYip &ampersand; Matthews ( 1991 ) present evidence of\nHong Kong learners &lsquo; avoidance of -; and difficulties using -;\nrelative clauses , especially when oblique or genitive is involved .\n\n\nGreen ( 1991a ) examines the overuse of topic-comment\nstructure in Hong Kong Chinese learners &lsquo; English which is cited as\nevidence of typological transfer , resulting in &lsquo; discourse accent\n&rsquo; , or &lsquo; unnecessary topic-comment structure &lsquo; as we prefer\nto call it ( e.g. , \"  For those staff who acted as senior\nones , they earn more salary  \" , p. 55; cf. &lsquo;\nperiphrastic topic construction &rsquo; , Yip , 1995 &semi; see also\nRutherford , 1983 ) .\n\n\nComparing &lsquo; Hong Kong English &rsquo; with Singapore English ,\nBudge ( 1989 ) attributes Hong Kong students &lsquo; failure to\nmark plural nouns with ( s ) in writing partly to Cantonese\nphonology , that is , the fact that Cantonese has no final ( s\n) or final consonant clusters .\n\n\nThe same reason probably accounts for the systematic omission of\nplural marking for English words ending with alveolar fricatives , as in\n\"  many  waitress  and waiters  \" (\np. 12 ) . \n\n \n\nLee ( 1990 ) addresses pedagogical issues such as\nwhen to correct learner errors and what types of errors should receive\npriority attention of the ESL teacher .\n\n\nBased on oral classroom data , Lee ( 1990 ) discusses\ndifferent levels of errors , their relative teachability , and the need for\ncorrective treatment in cases where &lsquo; error gravity &rsquo; is high ,\nas when intelligibility or communicability is at stake ( i.e. ,\n&lsquo; global &rsquo; instead of &lsquo; local &rsquo; errors ) .\n\n\nShe also expresses doubt about the desirability of correcting\nhigh-frequency errors and argues that , other things being equal , it is\nerror type rather than error token that matters .\n\n\nFurther , she queries the practicality of the general advice that\nerrors which stigmatize the learner should be corrected .\n\n\nIn her view , this advice may not be easy to follow since it is not\nimmediately clear which error is stigmatized by which type(s ) of native\nspeakers . \n\n \n\nMore recently , there are a few corpus-based projects of ESL\nerrors involving Chinese learners .\n\n\nGranger et al. ( 1994 ) report work in progress on\ntheir ICLE project ( <It> International Corpus of Learner English\n ) involving learner errors from nine Ll backgrounds , including\nChinese .\n\n\nFrom each of the nine sources , a computerized one-million-word\ncorpus comprising written data of five different learner varieties will be\ncreated .\n\n\nLearner profile will be carefully controlled to ensure comparability .\n\n\nNative-speaker language output will be used as baseline data for\ncomparison .\n\n\nData will be processed rigorously in five stages : encoding , markup\n, word-category tagging , parsing and coding .\n\n\nIn the same volume as Granger et al. ( 1994 ) , McNeill\n( 1994 ) gives a progress report of the development of a\n&lsquo; Hong Kong corpus of lexical errors in spontaneous speech &lsquo;\nobtained from spontaneous conversations .\n\n\nHe points out the pedagogical limitations of using concordancing to\nstudy learner errors in a corpus , especially with regard to second language\nvocabulary acquisition and argues that , in terms of insights into the nature\nof learner difficulties or explanations as to why errors occurred in the\nfirst place , it does not seem fruitful to compare the correct English of\nnative speakers  '  base-line data with L2 learner errors in a corpus . \n\n \n\nThe brief review of scholarly work on Hong Kong-specific ESL\nerrors above suggests that work in this area remains fragmented and limited\nin scope .\n\n\nFrom both the practical point of view of providing useful suggestions\nfor making pedagogically sound error-correction instruction , as well as the\ntheoretical perspective of enlightening the international research community\non Hong Kong CIL-specific cross linguistic influence and interlanguage\nresearch , there is clearly a need for a large-scale , systematic study of\nHong Kong-based learner errors with a view to yielding empirical findings in\norder to ( a ) establish taxonomies of errors with regard to\ndifferent proficiency levels , ( b ) design and experiment with\nremedial materials continually with a view to helping learners overcome\nrecurrent ESL errors , and ( c ) report findings to the\ninternational research community about universal as well as unique features\nof Hong Kong CIL .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "fee6a565-a916-4e1d-875c-040fcb0141a0", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.040587+00:00"}

{"text": "End this selfishness  \n\n \n\nIf a public consultation into proposals to block mobile phone\nsignals at performance venues reveals widespread support - as it surely ought\nto do - we could become the first place in the world where such blocking\ndevices are legalised . \n\n \n\nThe result , no doubt , will mean both good and bad publicity .\n\n\nThe good will come from the fact that , at last , the insufferable\nproblem of selfish and ignorant people who are prepared to allow the\ndisruption of others ' enjoyment of a movie or performance simply because they\ncannot bear to miss out on what is often an inane and unimportant\nconversation , will have been solved .\n\n\nThe bad publicity will emerge when it is realised that a large number\nof people in Hong Kong are incapable of acting in a civilised manner by\nsimply obeying requests to turn off their phones .\n\n\nThat these requests signally fail to make an impact has now become\nobvious , and such a state of affairs is profoundly sad . \n\n \n\nIt is clear that when (  as we report today ) , a famous actress\nmakes a heartfelt appeal to an audience of a Shakespeare play to turn off\ntheir phones , and when a tennis star cannot make a serve because of the\ndistractions from constant ringing , it is time to act . \n\n \n\nIt now appears technical difficulties can be overcome - blocking\ncan , if carefully controlled , be confined to precise areas; medical pagers\ncan be operated on frequencies unaffected by blocking devices .\n\n\nThere is therefore no longer any reason to delay . \n\n \n\nCertainly , the  South China Morning Post   ' s letters\npage will explode in celebration if a ban is introduced . \n\n \n\nIn truth , although the problem is especially bad here , it is\nalso growing in other parts of the world .\n\n\nAnd it should be remembered that only a tiny minority of people here\ndeliberately leave phones switched on in places of entertainment .\n\n\nUnfortunately , this minority can leave an impression that Hong Kong\naudiences are full of philistines .\n\n\nThis is untrue and it is about time these selfish , stubborn people\nwere prevented once and for all from besmirching Hong Kong  ' s reputation.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Trouble on the cards  \n\n \n\nFor the second time in a week , the problem of people in Hong\nKong getting into trouble with their credit card bills has been thrown into\nthe spotlight . \n\n \n\nOn Tuesday , the Government revealed a huge rise in personal\nbankruptcies for the first three months of this year compared with the year\nbefore .\n\n\nThe administration blamed two linked reasons: the rise in the number\nof unemployed , and excessive borrowing by individuals . \n\n \n\nThe problem , it was claimed , meant that the banking sector was\nlosing &dollar;13 million every day due to credit card debt being written off\nonce borrowers go bankrupt . \n\n \n\nThen investment bank Morgan Stanley claimed Hong Kong had one of\nthe highest rates of credit card defaults in the developed world .\n\n\nThe bank said in a report this week that Hong Kong  ' s charge-off rate\nnow looked set to hit 10 per cent in the first quarter of this year . \n\n \n\nIt is easy to see how this is happening .\n\n\nThe economic downturn is throwing more people out of work , and\nfrequently meaning a cut in the wages of those left in a job .\n\n\nFaced with a declining income it is not hard to see why people choose\nbankruptcy as a way out of their problems , leaving their credit card debt\nunpaid . \n\n \n\nThe banks themselves say part of the problem is the ease with\nwhich bankrupts can get discharged . They blame the increase on the\nrelaxation of rules that allow bankrupt individuals to resume borrowing after\njust four years instead of eight years previously . \n\n \n\nHowever , banks also have to take their own share of the blame .\n\n\nFaced with lower margins between their traditional borrowing and\nlending lines , they have sought new areas of business .\n\n\nThe rising debts are seen as a side effect of banks scrambling to\noffset weak mortgage demand by aggressively pushing high-yield credit cards\nand consumer loans . \n\n \n\nTo their credit , some of the banks admit this has caused them\nproblems .\n\n\nOne way to address the problem they say is to allow them to share\nmore information about their clients , such as the number of cards they have\nor their level of credit .\n\n\nHowever , the proposals have attracted criticism that they involve an\ninvasion of personal privacy . \n\n \n\nThe banks could help their case by taking steps of their own .\n\n\nThey could stop , for example , the dangerous habit of sending out\npre-approved credit-card applications where one signature is all it takes to\nsecure a credit line . \n\n \n\nBoth consumers and banks need to take their share of the\nresponsibility if the bankruptcy problem is to be addressed . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Time for tough talk  \n\n \n\nFollowing their meeting yesterday , US Secretary of State Colin\nPowell and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon were careful not to display\nany of the discord and frustration they must now be feeling towards one\nanother .\n\n\nCertainly , behind the smiles and the expressions of sympathy for\nIsrael  ' s suffering at the hands of Palestinian terrorists , Mr Powell and\nhis team of negotiators must now be furious at Israel  ' s intransigence\ntowards US demands for an immediate troop withdrawal from the West Bank .\n\n\n \n\nCordiality between the two countries - the US being Israel  ' s\nclosest ally - as well as pragmatism will no doubt mean the deep frustrations\ncan , for the time being , be kept away from public gaze .\n\n\nAnd yet , Israel will find itself playing an extremely risky hand if\nit continues to defy the clear cut demands of a US President , demands that\nare now , no doubt , being relayed by President Bush  ' s most senior member of\ngovernment . \n\n \n\nIsrael has a much-deserved reputation for refusing to take orders\nor be intimidated by any other nation - when attacked it hits back hard and\nkeeps on hitting until the threat is gone .\n\n\nIn the past it was surrounded by nations dedicated to its destruction .\n\n\nIt could afford no other strategy . But today  ' s struggle is\ndifferent .\n\n\nThe enemy is not a clearly defined body of troops; instead it is a\nspirit .\n\n\nFor the most part this spirit is one of hatred , and one that\ninspires people to blow themselves up in a cause that - however misguided\nthey may be - they believe in .\n\n\nThis spirit will only feed on Israeli military campaigns . \n\n \n\nIsrael is entitled to hit back against terrorism .\n\n\nBut , as Mr Powell pointed out following his meeting with Mr Sharon ,\nthe challenge now is how to get beyond the response .\n\n\nSooner or later , Israel will have to respond to US pressure and\nwithdraw its troops .\n\n\nMr Powell has provided the mandatory smiles and reassurances of\nsympathy; he must now talk tough and make it clear that ignoring the demands\nof the US President , and the whole international community , is no longer an\noption . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Attractive proposal  \n\n \n\nProperty developers have reported brisk sales at several new\ndevelopments at the West Kowloon reclamation .\n\n\nThat should have been really good news , had it not been achieved by\npricing the units cheaper than comparable developments launched only a short\nwhile ago . \n\n \n\nAlmost five years after the property market peaked , there are as\nyet no signs that prices have bottomed .\n\n\nThat is bad news for all homeowners , particularly an estimated\n73,000 who had bought before 1997 and whose flats are now worth less than\ntheir mortgages . \n\n \n\nIf prices continue to plunge , as warned by the Hong Kong\nMonetary Authority , another 12,000 households could be similarly affected\nwhen the year ends . \n\n \n\nIt is against such a background that the Hong Kong Mortgage\nCorporation is being asked to give its blessing to a proposal that would\nallow homeowners in negative equity to borrow up to 140 per cent of the value\nof their property . \n\n \n\nThe proposal will not completely help homeowners shake free of\ntheir deflated assets .\n\n\nAs a means of lessening their burden , however , it looks attractive .\n\n\n \n\nOn the basis that prices have fallen about 50 per cent since 1997\n, allowing homes to be re-financed at up to 140 per cent of their present\nvalue would amount to issuing a loan equivalent to the book value of the\noriginal mortgage .\n\n\nThat would enable homeowners to benefit from the low interest rates\nat which new mortgages are being granted . \n\n \n\nThe key to the success of the proposal is that the HKMC could be\nconvinced of the viability of covering the risk of default by charging a\npremium at about four to five per cent of the value of the new loan . \n\n \n\nIt is important that the scheme  ' s feasibility be given\nexpeditious consideration , as its success hinges on seizing the advantages\npresented by interest rates which are currently extremely low . \n\n \n\nSome economists have warned that the Federal Reserve may have to\nraise interest rates to prevent the recovering American economy from\nrebounding too quickly . \n\n \n\nShould that happen , a golden opportunity to help our unfortunate\nhomeowners would be lost . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Extend this scheme  \n\n \n\nBy any standard , a response rate of 5.6 per cent for any scheme\nis low and a 1.2 per cent take-up rate dismal . \n\n \n\nIn their eagerness to promote the rental subsidy scheme for the\nelderly , however , officials say those figures show the new initiative is\n\" widely accepted by the community and well-received by the elderly\nrecipients\" . \n\n \n\nOf the 7,722 potential applicants , they even interviewed the 89\nwho accepted rental vouchers and presented the findings as evidence of the\nscheme  ' s \" positive &rdquo; reception . \n\n \n\nYet , although officials might have been overzealous in promoting\nthe scheme , that was no reason to dismiss its merits .\n\n\nUntil now , a major weakness of Hong Kong  ' s public housing programme\nhas been a lack of choice .\n\n\nLow-income families on the waiting list get no help at all until they\nare allocated a flat built by the Housing Authority . \n\n \n\nThe lack of a rental option would have been acceptable had the\nwaiting time been short . But that was not the case .\n\n\nThe waiting period had been as long as seven to 10 years , although\nit has been reduced to about three years in recent times . \n\n \n\nThe beauty of a rental subsidy scheme is that it is flexible and\ncosts less than building public housing estates .\n\n\nFor the eligible beneficiaries , it should mean faster relief from\ntheir plight . \n\n \n\nWith a rental voucher , they can immediately afford to move into\nbetter accommodation located where they want .\n\n\nFor some , the rental option will be preferable to moving into a\npublic housing estate far away from their workplace or their children  ' s\nschool .\n\n\nThe scheme should be extended to cover all households as soon as\npossible . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Case for an amnesty  \n\n \n\nNineteen-year-old Lin Yeung-ming has been told she can stay here\n, just two days before she was to be repatriated to the mainland and\nseparated from her twin sister and parents for a second time .\n\n\nIt is the first encouraging sign of the Director of Immigration\nexercising compassion in handling right-of-abode seekers whose applications\nto stay have been rejected . \n\n \n\nBut the round-about way in which Yeung-ming is being allowed to\nexercise her right to stay has suggested that the director remains\ncircumspect in exercising his discretion . \n\n \n\nYeung-ming is among the 4,000-odd right-of-abode seekers whose\nclaims were rejected by the Court of Final Appeal in January .\n\n\nThe top court accepted that statements made by senior officials in\n1997 had created a legitimate expectation in their minds that they could\nbenefit from the first abode ruling handed down in 1999 . \n\n \n\nBut in view of their large number , the court stopped short of\nallowing them to stay; instead , it asked the Director of Immigration to\nassess each case and exercise discretion to allow those who warrant\ncompassionate treatment to stay .\n\n\nYet , compassion has been demonstrably absent on the part of the\ndirector , who has allowed no one to stay , until now . \n\n \n\nEven now , Yeung-ming is being allowed to stay officially at the\nbehest of the mainland authorities , not the Director of Immigration .\n\n\nMainland officials have apparently been persuaded that Yeung-ming is\na special case and will issue her a one-way permit to settle in Hong Kong .\n\n\nShe will now have to go back to her home town to collect the\ndocument . \n\n \n\nWhat immigration officials have done for Yeung-ming is similar\nto what they achieved for a number of adopted mainland children whose cases\nto stay here were also rejected but were issued permits by mainland\nauthorities after sustained public pressure . \n\n \n\nFor Yeung-ming and those adopted children concerned , it is the\noutcome that matters .\n\n\nBut the indirect way in which their wishes have been granted is a\nreminder that the Immigration Department is still sticking to the strict\npolicy laid down by the SAR Government . \n\n \n\nAs long as the Government continues to treat abode seekers as a\nburden to Hong Kong who should be barred from crossing the border , few can\nexpect to be reunited with their separated families here . \n\n \n\nThe efforts of immigration officials who have worked hard behind\nthe scenes to allow Yeung-ming to stay should be recognised , but the case\nfor a one-off amnesty for all abode seekers who had approached the courts for\nthe right to stay remains strong .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "e01b8833-7771-4c9b-80b2-b2d9704f0ec6", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.043135+00:00"}

 the 32-year-old entrepreneur says .\n\n\n\" I had seen many kennels overseas , such as in New York , and\nalways wondered why Hong Kong didn't have similar facilities. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nSo , like their canine counterparts in the West , Hong Kong dogs\ncan now look forward to OTT  tai-tai  treatment .\n\n\nFor those who simply can't bear the thought of roughing it on the\nfloor , there are specially designed beds to ensure good support and a full\nnight  ' s sleep .\n\n\nThose too excited to drift off but in need of their beauty sleep can \" request &rdquo; chill-out music: anything from New Age rainforest sounds to\nmiddle-of-the-road jazz .\n\n\nA bit of primping also doesn't go astray .\n\n\nTo look their best - a must in new company - dogs can have their hair\nstyled in the latest fashion , be it poodle puff-balls or straight bangs ,\nchina-doll style . \n\n \n\nSeeing a niche in the market , and despite having no experience\nin animal care (  apart from knowledge gained through books ) , Pang quit her\njob as a personal secretary at a fashion house and , with the help of family\nand friends , invested more than &dollar;1 million in the venture .\n\n\nSome of the money went into hi-tech extras such as ultrasonic\nsilencers that emit a high-pitched sound that , apparently , calms down\nexcitable , small yappers (  the technology doesn't yet work on big dogs ) .\n\n\n \n\nHer efforts were rewarded .\n\n\nRooms were full throughout Christmas and the Lunar New Year ,\nalthough , with most people back home from their holidays , only one-third of\nrooms were occupied during a recent weekday .\n\n\nOverall , however , income from boarding amounts to only 20 per cent\nof turnover , the shop on the top floor bringing in 40 per cent and grooming\nservices much of the rest . \n\n \n\nPang runs Dogotel with the help of her sister , registered nurse\nJulie Pang Tsui-yee , and five PR agents - in the furry forms of Pomeranians\nBubble and Max , poodle Ted , lhasa apso Bebe andYorkshire terrier Suki .\n\n\nThe four-legged assistants help entertain guests , among them\n12-year-old Max and seven-year-old Moey , both golden retrievers .\n\n\nMax and Moey , on their third visit in as many months , make the\nshort trip from their home in Hunghom whenever Patrick Boyle and his wife ,\nBessie Pang Boyle , pop across the border to Shenzhen to see relatives . \n\n \n\n\" You can sense they  ' re very comfortable here , and well taken\ncare of , so now I don't feel worried, &rdquo;  Patrick Boyle says . \n\n \n\nBasanna Lo Lai-ching feels the same way , and is relieved she no\nlonger has to deposit her two-year-old Jack Russell terrier at a friend  ' s\nhome or neighbourhood pet shops when she goes away .\n\n\n\" I felt heartbroken leaving her in a tiny cage, &rdquo;  Lo says , adding\nthat on two occasions her dog picked up a skin infection and developed a\nfever because of what she believes to be unsanitary conditions at some shops .\n\n\n \n\nAt  Dogotel  , hygiene appears to be a priority ,\nalthough , unlike many other boarding houses , dogs are allowed to fraternise\nbecause , as Pang says , \" they are sociable animals &rdquo;  .\n\n\nCanine guests are inspected upon arrival to ensure they are free of\nfleas and other health problems , and have proof of relevant vaccinations .\n\n\nSleeping areas are fitted with air purifiers and industrial-strength\nfans to remove hair and dirt .\n\n\nAnd waste is removed frequently throughout the day , with urine going\nstraight through the sieve-like floor into drains below .\n\n\nBowls are sterilised before use and beds are changed daily . \n\n \n\nHowever , this kind of service comes at a price .\n\n\nA 12-sq-ft room costs &dollar;180 a night while \" suites &rdquo;  are\n&dollar;280 a night , with discounts offered for extended stays .\n\n\nThen there are the extras: a shampoo and blow-dry , for instance ,\ncosts between &dollar;150 and &dollar;550 , while a hairdo can cost anywhere\nfrom &dollar;250 to &dollar;750 .\n\n\nIn comparison , a typical boarding fee at a kennel ranges from\n&dollar;55 to &dollar;135 a day , or &dollar;80 to &dollar;100 at pet stores\n, where a wash is typically in the &dollar;90 to &dollar;200 range .\n\n\nThe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals , meanwhile ,\ncharges &dollar;95 to &dollar;145 for boarding at its Wan Chai kennel , which\nhas a 24-hour in-house vet (  unlike Dogotel , which calls them in when\nrequired ) as well as an indoor playground . \n\n \n\nThe comparatively high costs are worth it for Vivien Cheung\nTsz-man .\n\n\nBefore she discovered Dogotel , the general manager of a printing\ncompany eschewed holidays because she didn't want to leave Ah Sa , her\nsix-month-old schnauzer , behind .\n\n\nNow , she says , it seems Ah Sa doesn't want to return home when she\ngoes to collect her from Dogotel .\n\n\n\" She resists , pushing her feet against the door, &rdquo;  Cheung says ,\nlaughing . \n\n \n\nCoffee understands why .\n\n\nThe nine-month-old basenji , who used to be left with friends when\nhis owner travelled , lies comfortably on his bed , enjoying the cool ,\nconditioned air .\n\n\nSoon it will be play time , perhaps a special hairstyle and later\ndinner and another lie down .\n\n\nWho could blame him if , after a week  ' s stay , he too doesn't feel\nlike leaving ?\n\n\nIf this is a dog  ' s life , he could certainly do with more . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Creepy-crawly cuisine   \n\n\nPest controllers , the Lee family , love their work so much they\nhappily lap up the bugs they find: fired , boiled or row .\n\n\n Sherry Lee  digs in - to the story , that is \n\n \n\n WHEN PEST  controller Lee Yuet-keung takes his work\nhome with him , his wife wouldn't be more thrilled . for in the Lee household\n, there  ' s nothing more delicious than a   cop-totermes\nformosanus   omelette . \n\n \n\nLee isn't your ordinary pest controller .\n\n\nAnd Lee family dinners aren't your normal meals .\n\n\nWhether it is lashings of dead termites lacing soups and congee ,\nsumptuous semi-conscious bugs liberally sprinkled on salads or mixed with\nrice , or little critters steamed or fried soup succulent pork spare ribs - a\ngastronomic reward comes from a hard day  ' s graft by the Lees . \n\n \n\n\" They taste like shrimps; they are fresh , sweet and\nnutritious ,  &rdquo; enthuses Lee , 58 .\n\n\n\" I soak them in water first , filter them out , put them on a\nplate and dip them in soy sauce or salt with sesame oil .\n\n\nSometimes they bite my tongue , so I use my teeth or fingers to crush\nthem to death .  &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe Lees feast on all kinds of termites - but for sheer taste it\njust has to be   coptoter-mes formosanus   ,\nsometimes , ignorantly , called a white ant .\n\n\nThe most common of several dozen types of Hong Kong termite , this\nparticular species makes for particularly good banquets in the Lee  ' s\nhousehold in Wong Tai Sin . \n\n \n\nCaterpillars may be a delicacy in Mexico ,  witchetty\n grubs in Australia  ' s Outback , and locusts the preserve of many a\nmainlander , but in Chuk Yuen South Estate , the   cop-totermes\nformosanus   is king .\n\n\nWell , actually , Lee Yuet-keung is king-the self-styled \"\ntermite king\" . \n\n \n\nLee was destined to become a pest controller from his very first\nmouthful of termites as a baby in his family  ' s Huiyang village in Guangdong .\n\n\n\" I don't know when it first started , but I do know that in my\ngreat-grandfather  ' s time , my ancestors had already eating termites ,\n\n&rdquo; he says . \n\n \n\nThe family kept their habit a secret from fellow villagers ,\nfearing they would be ridiculed-and that others would scoff their supply .\n\n\nBut at home , they would eat several thousand termites each day .\n\n\n \n\n\" My mum would put half a bowl of termites into my congee\nfor me ,  &rdquo; Lee reminisces .\n\n\n\" My parents told me termites were nutritious .\n\n\nSome of my siblings wouldn't eat them .\n\n\nThey found them disgusting , but I loved them .\n\n\nI thought that when I got older , I would go to hunt them myself .\n\n&rdquo; \n\n \n\nToday , Lee and two of his three sons , Foo-wah , 20 , and\nChun-yip , 18 , make up the Tung Sang Company , which specialises in\neradicating premises of the litter menaces , which can cause havoc by\nfeasting on wood , carpets and fabric .\n\n\nOn finding a nest - made from the termites ' droppings and saliva -\nthe Lees first secure their dinner then destroy the remainder with pesticide .\n\n\n\" When people aren't looking , I quickly put the termites into\na plastic bag ,  &rdquo; Lee says . \n\n \n\nLee , his wife Lam Kin-nam , and all three sons , including\nstudent Fu-wing , 21 , tuck in at home to the daily catch , although Lam\nrecalls being less than bowled over by the prospect when the couple first met .\n\n\nLove , however , won out .\n\n\n\" He said the termites were fat and very nutritious and asked\nme to try some ,  &rdquo; Lam , 45 , recalls .\n\n\n\" It was delicious , just like the taste of meat .  &rdquo; \n\n \n\nFoo-wah has eaten the bugs since he was a baby , but didn't tell\nhis mates for fear they would think him a little odd .\n\n\nEventually though , they found out .\n\n\n\" They all thought I was strange , but some said they wanted to\ntry , so I brought them home for a termites meal .\n\n\nAt the table , no one dared to start eating .\n\n\nThen one began to eat and they all followed .\n\n\nThey all said the termites were delicious .  &rdquo; \n\n \n\nFoo-wah favours his termites fired; for Chun-yip , it has to be\nbug omelette .\n\n\nAnd just for those occasions in the colder , drier months when\ntermites are harder to find , the family breeds them at home for a ready\nsupply . \n\n \n\nBut for the entire family , the insects aren't just the spice of\ndinners , but the stuff of dreams .\n\n\n\" In one dream , I stole my brother  ' s plate of termites ,\n\n&rdquo; Chun-yip recalls .\n\n\nHis father , with an embarrassed smile , admits one of his recurring\ndreams is that he is searching a house for a nest without success .\n\n\nFor him it  ' s the stuff of nightmares - the frightening prospect of a\nbland family dinner . \n\n \n\n sherry.lee@scmp.com   \n\n \n\n \" They taste like shrimps.. . sometimes they bite my\ntongue , so I use my teeth or fingers to crush them to death  &rdquo;

{"text": "DANCING ,  CH'I  , AND THE HOLY SPIRIT  \n\n\n Peter K. H. Lee   \n\n \n\nSome time ago at an Asian theological seminar I read a paper with\nthe title , \" Can Theologians Dance on the Top of a Pin ? &rdquo;\n\n\nThe title is a take-off on a question raised by Scholastics of the\nMiddle ages , \" How many angels can dance on the top of a pin ? &rdquo;\n\n\nI wrote that paper to encourage younger Asian\ntheologians-in-the-making to make theology lively , as dancing is lively , by\nsuggesting that creative theological thinking can come from even a small\nplace like Hong Kong , which is the size of a pin  ' s head on the map . \n\n \n\nThis article is a further exploration of the possibilities for\ndoing theology , which like a wonderful dance performance , would leave a\nvivid and lasting impression on one  ' s consciousness .\n\n\nI again use Hong Kong as a locus of theological exploration .\n\n\nI shall move into the level of theological thinking by way of the\ndancing scene in Hong Kong .\n\n\nBut I find  ch'i  ( \n, meaning breath of air ) , as a Chinese philosophical category , a\nhelpful frame of reference for rethinking the Spirit in the Christian sense .\n \n\n\nDancing on the Hong Kong Scene \n\n \n\nHong Kong is not noted for its development of dancing as an art\nform .\n\n\nBut , notwithstanding its critics  '  denigration of Hong Kong as a\n\" cultural desert , &rdquo; in the last decade it has sponsored annual\nArts Festivals and Asian Arts Festivals which bring outstanding musicians and\nperforming groups from many parts of the world .\n\n\nIn the dancing field , the world  ' s top ballet companies , including\nSadler  ' s Wells Ballet , the Royal Danish Ballet , the Bolshoi Ballet Company\n, etc . , have graced the stages of performing theatres in Hong Kong .\n\n\nPractically all of the countries in Asia have sent dancing groups to\nperform during the Asian Arts Festivals and   on other\n occasions .\n\n\nThis year there is a Chinese Minority Groups Dance Festival ,\nfeaturing some eight dancing troupes from China .\n\n\nSo Hong Kong is a place where one has the opportunity to see dance\nperformances of many kinds -; from Europe and North America , from Asia\nand China  ' s various regions . \n\n \n\nBut has Hong Kong itself produced anything notable in the art of\ndancing ?\n\n\nThe answer , alas , is that Hong Kong has nothing specially its own\nin this field .\n\n\nOne has to look very hard to find anything worthy about dancing on\nthe Hong Kong scene .\n\n\nThere is , as yet , no world class dance emerging from the indigenous\nHong Kong culture .  \n\n\n Lion Dance and Dragon Dance  \n\n \n\nLet me begin with a type of \" dancing &rdquo; which has\ndeep roots in the folk culture of the Hong Kong Chinese people though it is\nnot of a high art form .\n\n\nI refer to the lion dance and the dragon dance .\n\n\nThey are centuries old Chinese customs .\n\n\nThey have survived to this day in Hong Kong  ' s Chinese community .\n\n\n \n\nThe two are not identical , but one or the other often appears at\na New Year ( lunar calendar ) celebration or some other special\noccasion . \n\n \n\nThe lion dance uses a \" lion &rdquo; (  papier\nmach\u00e9  head on a large wooden frame and a body made of a long\npiece of cloth ) .\n\n\nTwo persons are needed to perform the dance , one at the head and one\nat the tail .\n\n\nThe one carrying the head up and down must be a strong man , moving\nthe head with his arms and turning it in various directions , whilst doing\nfancy foot-work .\n\n\nThe one at the tail holds the cloth that is the \" body &rdquo;\nand takes agile foot-steps .\n\n\nThe lion dances to the beat of a drum or a gong . \n\n \n\nThe lion can do tricks , e.g . teasing the fire-crackers and\njumping or climbing up a tree to pick a bundle of green vegetables hanging\nfrom a high place .\n\n\nWhat does the lion dance signify ?\n\n\nIt is supposed to assure good fortune for the community .\n\n\nThe lion , being a strong animal , is a symbol of power -; power\nto defeat or dispel evil forces and power to bring good fortune .\n\n\nThe \" vitality &rdquo; of the lion is acknowledged right at the\nstart of the dance by the &rdquo; dotting of the lion  ' s eyes &rdquo; with\nink .\n\n\nThis is done by an important personage . \n\n \n\nSometimes two lions dance , one male and one female .\n\n\nIt is like a  pas des deux  , but of course it is not\nrefined dancing as in ballet . \n\n \n\nThe dragon dance is more elaborate , because the dragon is more\nhighly decorated and much longer .\n\n\nThe dragon dance requires more people to hold up the head , the body\nand the tail .\n\n\nIf it is performed at a New Year function , the function must be a\nbig event .\n\n\nThe dragon dance may also be a part of a celebration program on other\noccasions .\n\n\nWhatever the occasion is , it must be important . \n\n \n\nThe lion dance or the dragon dance is usually performed\nout-of-doors , in a public square or park .\n\n\nA large crowd gathers to watch the dance as a part of a community\ncelebration .  \n\n\n  Ch'an  Dance  \n\n \n\nFrom the lion dance and the dragon dance , which are extroverted\n, noisy and fast-moving , I turn to a   ch'an  \n(  zen  ) dance performance , which is introverted ,\nquiet and slow-moving .\n\n\n  \"   ch'an   \"\n  in Chinese ( or  \" zen \"  in\nJapanese ) is the word for meditation .\n\n\nThe   ch'an   Buddhist Sect , emphasizing\nmeditation , takes its name from the word .\n\n\nActually there is no species of dancing called \"  \nch'an   dance &rdquo; as such &semi;\n\n\nit was by coincidence that I saw a performance which was advertised\nas \"   ch'an   dance . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nIt was a performance choreographed by a Korean woman residing in\nHong Kong , Madam Lee , who is convinced that meditation according to the\n  ch'an   Sect is a good tonic for the busy and\nrestless life of a modern city like Hong Kong ( and Seoul ) .\n\n\nA dancer and choreographer trained in modern dancing , Madam Lee\ndeveloped her     ch'an    \ndance by working with a small group of dancers .\n\n\nHers is a small company performing only occasionally .\n\n\nOut of curiosity I went to see one of its performances . \n\n \n\nI have not kept a program of the dance performance , and I cannot\nrecall the details .\n\n\nBut I did have an over-all impression of what the dance endeavored to\ncommunicate .\n\n\nTo put it in another way , the dance has transmitted to me a sense of\n  ch'an   or  zen  . \n\n \n\nThe performance that evening was on the whole slow-moving &semi;\ntoo much so , I am afraid , for fast-paced Hong Kong .\n\n\nPerhaps the slow movement was meant to be a contrast to the frenzied\nHong Kong tempo .\n\n\nIf so , the contrast could have been more effective by moving from a\nfast tempo at the start to a slower-paced performance . \n\n \n\nAt any rate , sitting in the audience I was gradually drawn into\na sense of wholeness , breaking up the usual box-like image of the stage ,\nbreaking down the barrier between the audience as on-lookers and the\nperformers as far away \" objects , &rdquo; and breaking through into an\ninner consciousness .\n\n\nThe consciousness was inner holistic space , which was not just a\nvoid but was illuminated by insights . \n\n \n\nThe   ch'an   dance may have been\nslow-paced , yet it was movement .\n\n\nOne number reminded me of   t'ai-chi-ch'iian \n movements .\n\n\nThose who are adept at   t'ai-chi-chiian  \ncan practice meditation (     ch'an \n   ) in motion .\n\n\nBy the same token , the   ch'an   dance is a\nform of meditation in motion or slow movement .\n\n\nHow ?\n\n\nAs I understand it , in this kind of   ch'an \n one meditates \" mind &rdquo; itself is \" mind-less\n&rdquo; ( i.e. emptied of any fixated idea ) , but moves along\nwith action , which is flowing and rhythmic .\n\n\nAccordingly , consciousness of the mind flows rhythmically , with the\n  tao   disclosing itself along the way . \n\n \n\nI may have read more into the   ch'an  \ndance than what was warranted , but for a few fleeting moments a sense of\n  ch'an   meditation was mediated to me . \n\n \n\nThe   ch'an   dance is by no means in\nthe main-stream of the Hong Kong dancing scene .\n\n\nIn fact , very few people know how to appreciate it .\n\n\nThe performance that I saw was not particularly impressive .\n\n\nYet it is noted here for a special reason .\n\n\n  Ch'an   meditation does seem to have\nsomething to offer in a crowded and frantic place like Hong Kong .\n\n\nIf a form of dancing can capture   ch'an  \nspirituality , credit is due to it .  \n\n\n A City Contemporary Dance Company Production  \n\n \n\nThe City Contemporary Dance Company , formed in 1979 , is Hong\nKong  ' s first professional contemporary dance company .\n\n\nIts choreographer-dancers , having received training in ballet and\nmodern dance of the Western tradition , now go back to classical Chinese\nliterary and artistic contemporary age .\n\n\nThe company  ' s productions are gaining recognition among the younger\ngenerations in Hong Kong and the troupes have travelled to neighboring Asian\ncities and elsewhere to perform . \n\n \n\nI refer here to a production entitled \" South Wind .\n&rdquo; The entire program is based on selections from the ancient classic ,\n  Shih Ching   ( the Book of Poems ) .\n\n\nAs is often the case with the company  ' s productions , this one seeks\nto re-interpret , by the dance , the classical texts in contemporary idiom .\n\n\n \n\nThe   Shih Ching   , dating back to\npre-Ch'in periods ( 12th-6th centuries B.C . ) , contains 305\npoems ( reportedly selected by Confucius , out of several thousand\n) .\n\n\nThe poems are grouped under the sections , \"  Feng\n \" ( Wind ) , \"  Ya  \"\n( Grace ) , and \"  Hsiung  \"\n( Ode ) .\n\n\n\" Wind &rdquo; includes ethos , life-style , prevailing customs\n,   Zeitgeist   ( the spirit of the times\n) , and ( by a play on the sound \"  feng \n\" ) satire ( \"  feng-ch'i  \"\n) .\n\n\nSo poems under the section of \" Wind &rdquo; grew out of the\nlife and times of the people from various regions of ancient China .\n\n\nThe poems are expressive and spontaneous , sometimes exuberant and\nsometimes sorrowful , and at times with a touch a satire or humor .\n\n\nUnder the section of \" Grace &rdquo; , are collected poems\nwritten by the gentry for court ceremonies and feasts .\n\n\n\" Ode &rdquo; is the collection of songs which were sung during\nroyal ceremonies .\n\n\nWe can see that the   Shih Ching   is a\nremarkable book .\n\n\nConfucius , whether or not he was the actual editor , reportedly\nvalued it highly .\n\n\n  Shih Ching   is one of the \" Five\nClassics . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe \" South Wind &rdquo; dance production has adopted 16\nnumbers from the \" Wind &rdquo; section , one each from \" Grace\n&rdquo; and \" Ode &rdquo; .\n\n\nThe 16 \" Wind &rdquo; numbers range widely in theme and style .\n\n\nThey include harvest in the plantation , a man longing for a woman ,\nthe sadness of an abandoned woman , a wedding , twilight , the panic of a\nwoman running away with her lover , the mother-child relationship .\n\n\nThe original poems are all short and focused , and the dances also\nspeak to a single theme pointedly . \n\n \n\nLet me refer to three numbers to illustrate how the\nchoreographers and dancers seek to translate ancient texts into contemporary\nidiom . \n\n \n\n\" Wind from the South &rdquo; has plants growing under the\ngentle breeze to signify the growing up of children under their mother  ' s\ncare , but the mother becomes tired ( suggested by the wilting of tree\nleaves ) , and the children regret their failure to return their\nfilial care to her ( as shown by the unruliness of the young plants\n) .\n\n\nThis kind of poignancy in the mother-child relationship is not\nuncommon in modern urban Hong Kong where mother love , given to the point of\nself-sacrifice , is as valid as anywhere else , and where traditional filial\npiety is still found though at times neglected .\n\n\nPoignancy comes when the children realize their failure to live up\nto their expected duty . \n\n \n\n\" Moon Rising &rdquo; depicts a man yearning for his\ndream-lover , to no avail .\n\n\nThe dream-girl is compared to the shining moon , and the man looking\nat it has his heart torn by emotions .\n\n\nThe dancing against the background of a moon effectively portrays\nthe conflict of emotions . \n\n \n\nMany a poem in the   Shih Ching   gives\ndancing a special place .\n\n\nOne of the poems , \" Heavenly Dance , &rdquo; celebrates the\nart of dancing .  \n\n \n\nThe dancers in this number dance with clean and vivacious steps\n, making their own rhythms with bright clapping sounds ( by slapping\ntheir belts ? ) .\n\n\nIt gives the feeling that dancing is pure joy and wholesome fun .\n\n\n \n\nOnly one number is selected from the \" Grace &rdquo;\nsection .\n\n\nIt is the \" Song of the Gentry &rdquo; .\n\n\nThe dance is a decorative , extravagant and fast-flowing piece of\nwork .\n\n\nThe backdrop and sidedrops ( made up of vertical panels of\ncloth in a gradation of light colors from cream to yellow to gold to green\n) and the costumes ( silvery gray silk with faint , simple\ndesigns for both sexes ) suggest a modern setting which has good taste\n, such as one would find amongst the younger affluent professionals in a\nplace like Hong Kong .\n\n\nThe dance movements are lively all right and rather expressive too\n-; lively over what and expressive of what ?\n\n\nThat is not clear .\n\n\nThe program notes say that the choreographer tries to show\n\" the emptiness of bourgeoisie festivities on a bounded\nstage . &rdquo;\n\n\nThat dance made me think of a \" yuppies &rdquo; party -;\nsmart people enjoying the pleasures of a consumer society but devoid of\nmeaning in their conversations and lives .\n\n\nWatching this number , I did enjoy it and found it engaging , but I\ncould not see the point -;\n\n\nperhaps the point of the dance is that there is not much meaning to\nthe kind of boxed-in existence ( suggested by the bounded stage set by\nthe cloth backdrops and sidedrops ) of the modern \" gentry\n&rdquo;

{"text": "Need for transparency  \n\n \n\nNo one disputes that the Hong Kong Government has the right to bar\nanyone it wishes from entering the territory without assigning any reason .\n\n\nSo there is no suggestion that the authorities acted outside the law\nwhen they refused entry to the exiled mainland dissident Harry Wu Hongda ,\neven though he was allowed in on an earlier occasion . \n\n \n\nOur only concern is that refusing people entry into Hong Kong\nwithout clear reasons being given could dilute the territory  ' s unique\ncharacter .\n\n\nUnder \" one country , two systems &rdquo; Hong Kong has remained\na free-wheeling city where people of all kinds of beliefs and political\npersuasions have been free to live and work , restricted only by the need to\nabide by the laws of the territory .\n\n\nThis is why dissidents exiled from the mainland have been able to live\nhere . \n\n \n\nThe Falun Gong , banned as an evil cult on the mainland , is free\nto practise in Hong Kong . Li Shaomin , the City University academic\nconvicted as a spy by the mainland , was still able to return to Hong Kong\nand work here .\n\n\nThe arrival in Hong Kong of another exiled mainlander , Huang Beiling\n, which we have reported today , is a welcome indication of Hong Kong  ' s\nopenness .\n\n\nThis open quality , as well as its legal system and its\nbusiness-friendly environment , are what make Hong Kong what it is .\n\n\nIt is these qualities that distinguish the territory and help it\ncompete with other cities in China .\n\n\nIf Hong Kong is to achieve its ambition of becoming a world city , it\nis important that it remains a place where different kinds of ideas and\nthoughts can be freely expressed . \n\n \n\nWhich is why we would urge the authorities to first exercise the\ngreatest caution before preventing anyone from entering Hong Kong , and\nsecond to provide an indication of the reasons for such action . \n\n \n\nIt is true that most countries make decisions on the entry of\nforeigners without revealing why .\n\n\nIn Hong Kong  ' s case , we believe it is important for the authorities\nto go the extra mile and be transparent about these decisions .\n\n\nIf the authorities believed that Harry Wu was coming to Hong Kong to\nconspire against the mainland , then saying so would strengthen their case .\n\n\nNot everyone would agree with the decision , but they would\nunderstand and respect the reasons behind it .\n\n\nTransparency should be seen as a strength , not as a weakness . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  A step forward  \n\n \n\nChief Executive Tung Chee-hwa  ' s launch of the accountability\nsystem for principal officials will mark a milestone in Hong Kong  ' s evolving\npolitical system . \n\n \n\nWith the creation of a new layer of political appointees who will\nbe answerable to the Chief Executive , and held accountable to him for policy\nblunders , the civil service will no longer be responsible for creating\ngovernment policies .\n\n\nThe job of civil servants will be to execute policies formulated by\nthe new appointees . \n\n \n\nThe most fundamental change lies in splitting the dual role of\ndepartmental administrator and policy-maker currently performed by\nsecretaries and bureau chiefs . \n\n \n\nUnder the new system , permanent under-secretaries , who will be\ncivil servants , will run the bureaus , while the politically appointed\nprincipal officials will be responsible for the political job of making\npolicies and seeking public support . \n\n \n\nFor the first time in Hong Kong  ' s history , all the principal\nofficials in charge of policy portfolios will sit on the Executive Council ,\nturning it into a functional cabinet , instead of an advisory body consisting\nof part-timers , as it is now . \n\n \n\nThe changes are being made for the sake of enhancing the quality\nof governance .\n\n\nThey are a belated response to calls for more accountability by a\ngovernment that has lurched from one blunder to another over the past five\nyears without any senior officials being disciplined . \n\n \n\nMr Tung hopes that his new batch of \" ministers\" , driven\nby a sense of commitment and dedication , will do a better job of\nimplementing his policies and respond to public demands . \n\n \n\nIt remains to be seen if the changes will really make things\neasier for him.\n\n\nFor one thing , the reform has not addressed the fundamentally\nconfrontational relationship between the executive authorities and the\nlegislature , whose members are constitutionally confined to acting as an\nopposition barred from ever governing Hong Kong . \n\n \n\nThe absence of a \" government party in the legislature will\nremain a headache for the politically appointed principal officials , just as\nit has been for their civil servant predecessors . \n\n \n\nThere has been talk of Mr Tung seeking to form a ruling coalition\nwith one or two parties by appointing their members to the Executive Council .\n\n\nHowever , both the Liberal Party and the Democratic Alliance for the\nBetterment of Hong Kong have had members sitting on the council over the past\nfive years . But that has not manifestly helped Mr Tung in getting the two\nparties ' support in the legislature . \n\n \n\nIn that sense , one could argue that , apart from giving Mr Tung\nfree rein to appoint people who share his vision to become his lieutenants ,\nthe only significant change that the reform will bring is that it will anchor\nthe political neutrality of the civil service . \n\n \n\nCivil servants brought up as bureaucratic administrators , but\nfinding themselves having to field politically motivated attacks as they move\nup the ladder , will in future be able to concentrate on the job of executing\npolicies . \n\n \n\nHowever , hard he tried to put on a brave face about his\nlegitimacy , Mr Tung  ' s limited electoral mandate will remain his weakest\nspot as he and his ministers cross swords with legislatures returned by much\nbigger electorates .\n\n\nIt is important that after 2007 , the chief executive is elected\nthrough a more representative system , so that he has as much popular\nlegitimacy as Legco . \n\n \n\nThe demand of legislators to play a role in scrutinising\ncandidates for principal officials is not unreasonable .\n\n\nThough the SAR Government is executive-led , giving Legco power to\nvet candidates will provide a useful check to an abuse of executive power .\n\n\n \n\nUntil the elected legislators are given a greater role suggesting\npolicy options , it is hard to see how Mr Tung  ' s new team will be able to\nreduce mindless point-scoring fights with legislators and enhance the\nefficiency of the governing machinery . \n\n \n\nMr Tung has declared that this new system will result in a\ngovernment that is more open , readier to listen to people , and more\nresponsive to public demands .\n\n\nWe believe it is a useful step in making the government more\naccountable . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  No simple answers  \n\n \n\nIf anyone thought economic recovery in the United States would\nkickstart Hong Kong  ' s job market , this month  ' s unemployment figures\nrepresent a dose of cold water .\n\n\nEconomic restructuring is a harsh beast and all sectors continue to\nshow weakness .\n\n\nEconomic insecurity permeates most strata of society . \n\n \n\nIt is increasingly clear that a rapid rebound in employment\nprospects of the sort which occurred in 1999-2000 is unlikely .\n\n\nHong Kong faces restructuring in many industries as a result of its\nchanging economic role .\n\n\nFirms long-insulated from severe competition must restructure to stay\nviable .\n\n\nPacific Century CyberWorks is the best example , but there are many\nothers . \n\n \n\nHowever , we should be cautious about jumping to overly\npessimistic conclusions .\n\n\nUnemployment is a lagging indicator that only improves some months\ninto an economic recovery .\n\n\nThe increase in the jobless rate to seven per cent in the three-month\nperiod to March , from 6.8 per cent a month earlier , includes seasonal\ndistortions .\n\n\nWhen temporary jobs created over the Lunar New Year holiday period\nare accounted for , it seems the underlying rate of joblessness has remained\nstatic during the first quarter of the year . \n\n \n\nThere are no simple answers to the SAR  ' s high jobless rate .\n\n\nA sustained global expansion will undoubtedly help , given our\ndependence on international trade .\n\n\nThe pegged exchange rate forces the whole economy to make a choice\nthat boils down to either lower wages or higher unemployment . \n\n \n\nAt such times , people inevitably turn to the Government , which\nhas an important role to play in retraining laid-off workers .\n\n\nWhether further large scale job creation schemes should be created is\ndebatable .\n\n\nFor a city economy , Hong Kong has a large public sector and a\ngrowing welfare culture .\n\n\nWhile the emergence of a class of long-term unemployed workers\nthreatens social stability , spending public money for low grade jobs\npromises to embed economic stagnation . \n\n \n\nWhat is needed is true political vision as to the kind of economy\nHong Kong must become if it is to sustain its standard of living .\n\n\nThat will inevitably be deeply integrated with the Pearl River Delta\nand almost entirely focused on high value-added services .\n\n\nPressing policy issues revolve around a proposed population policy\nand reform of protected domestic sectors if new types of businesses are to\nemerge . \n\n \n\nFortunately , this is happening without government involvement .\n\n\nSticking with the discipline is the only realistic option . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Rhetoric and reality  \n\n \n\nAdmiral Dennis Blair  ' s comments on the role the United States\nintends to play in maintaining stability across the Taiwan Strait are to be\nwelcomed .\n\n\nOn the one hand , the commander of US forces in the region reiterated\nhis country  ' s policy of arming Taiwan to the extent that forcible\nreunification by the mainland is not an option .\n\n\nBut he also made it clear that US arms sales to Taiwan were not to be\nseen as a move towards creating an independent Taiwan .\n\n\nHe said that a stable military balance across the Taiwan Strait was a\npre-condition to \" the peaceful achievement of one China , which is\nthe policy of China , the policy of Taiwan and the policy of the United\nStates &rdquo; . \n\n \n\nWhile the Chinese Government publicly describes any US role in\nthe cross-strait relationship as interference in China  ' s internal affairs ,\nWashington can play a stabilising role in the relationship between Beijing\nand Taipei . \n\n \n\nIt can do this by ensuring that military action cannot be an\noption in deciding the way the relations between Taiwan and the mainland\nevolve .\n\n\nEnsuring such a military balance is the best method of paving the way\nfor a healthy dialogue between the mainland and Taiwan on their future\nrelationship . \n\n \n\nAs Admiral Blair pointed out , the military balance between the\nmainland and Taiwan is stable at present and does not provide a basis either\nfor Taiwanese independence or forcible reunification . \n\n \n\nIt is important that nothing is done to upset this situation .\n\n\nAn increase in the number of missiles pointing towards Taiwan would\nupset this balance , as would the introduction of any new sophisticated\nweapons system into Taiwan . \n\n \n\nDespite the angry rhetoric that often spews across the Taiwan\nStrait , neither side is spoiling for a fight .\n\n\nAt the same time , they do not appear to be ready for talks and are\npoised in a no-man  ' s land between confrontation and dialogue .\n\n\nWashington can play a role in nudging them towards dialogue . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  The clean-up begins  \n\n \n\nGeographically , Hong Kong is part of the Pearl River Delta .\n\n\nAs pollution generated on one side of the Shenzhen River impacts the\nother , local initiatives to clean up the environment can never be fully\nsuccessful unless backed by regional efforts . \n\n \n\nThe Hong Kong Observatory recently confirmed what has long been\nobvious to all - visibility in Hong Kong is now four times worse than it was\n30 years ago .\n\n\nIn fact , worsening air pollution does not just affect Hong Kong .\n\n\nThe region as a whole is now shrouded in haze , if not smog , on most\ndays . \n\n \n\nHong Kong and Guangdong used to indirectly point accusing fingers\nat each other for causing the problem .\n\n\nGuangdong admitted its old coal-fired power plants were spilling out\nthick , black smoke and its vehicle exhausts were rich in carbon , sulphur\nand lead . \n\n \n\nBut it also noted that pollutants from Hong Kong could be blown\nnorthward to affect the province - a point accepted by Hong Kong only in\nrecent years . \n\n \n\nNow that both sides have put aside that dispute and research has\npinpointed the sources of pollution , it is gratifying that Guangdong has\nshown a clear determination to work closely with the SAR to address the\nproblem . \n\n \n\nOver the next few days , Guangdong is expected to adopt much more\nstringent standards on emission and fuel .\n\n\nSome old coal-fired power plants may even be closed . \n\n \n\nThe measures will not immediately clear the sky , but they are a\ngood start .\n\n\nIn fact , there is only so much Guangdong can do .\n\n\nThe province alone cannot decree that refineries on the mainland\nproduce cleaner diesel .\n\n\nEven after it has adopted stricter standards , vehicles from\nprovinces using sub-standard fuel will still cause problems as they pass\nthrough Guangdong . \n\n \n\nThe province  ' s efforts to combat water pollution is no less\ndaunting .\n\n\nJust cleaning up the tributaries of the Pearl River is a herculean\nundertaking .\n\n\nAlthough the problem does not directly affect Hong Kong , this is an\narea where the SAR  ' s expertise may prove helpful . \n\n \n\nHong Kong had a head start over Guangdong in addressing the\nsewage problem .\n\n\nIn the late 1980s , it banned the discharge of animal waste and\nuntreated sewage into rivers and storm water drains . \n\n \n\nRegrettably , these measures pushed some of the most polluting\nfactories across the border .\n\n\nGuangdong has \" benefited &rdquo; from their relocation , and\nit is time it cleaned up the smudge .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

MERITS OF SOFT SWITCHING INVERTER  \n\n \n\nAC drivers seem to be dominant in the propulsion system of EVs .\n\n\nTable 1 shows some as drives for those newly developed EVs in the\nworld .\n\n\nInverters which convert the limited battery energy to ac power for\npropulsion system and other accessory become very important .\n\n\nConventional hard switching inverters have been widely applied to ac\ndrives for modern EVs .\n\n\nHowever , hard switching inverters have high peak voltage and current\nstresses in devices as a result of inductive switching and diode reverse\nrecovery .\n\n\nThey have higher switching losses and proportionately increase with\nfrequency .\n\n\nHigh  dv/dt  results in acoustic noise and serious\nelectromagnetic interference (  EMI ) problems which are the major drawbacks of\nhard switching inverter technology .\n\n\nIn order to reduce these switching loss and EMI problems , hence\nmaximizing the efficiency , power density and reliability of inverters in EVs\n, special design of power devices and soft switching techniques for inverters\nhas become one of the major research directions in power electronics . \n\n \n\nSoft switching inverters was introduced at the late 1980s .\n\n\nFor a soft switching approach , a snubber circuit is used in parallel\nwith the self turn-off device to bypass the load current .\n\n\nThe regenerate snubber is more effective than the dissipative snubber .\n\n\nThe resonant inverter came up through improvement of the snubber\ncircuit .\n\n\nIn short , soft switching means that the voltage and/or current\nwaveforms of power switches can be shaped by using resonant network with or\nwithout auxiliary switches to attain zero-voltage and/or zero current\nconditions at switching instants .\n\n\nSoft switching inverters have low switching loss , low  di/dt\n in the device , low output voltage and  dv/dt  and low EMI ,\nthey do not require large Safe Operating Area (  SOA ) devices , and have\nhigher efficiency than hard switching inverters .\n\n\nHowever , they require additional components to achieve soft\nswitching operation .\n\n\nTable 2 gives a comparison of hard switching and soft switching\ninverters .\n\n\nIn this papers , we highlight features of several zero voltage\nswitching (  ZVS ) inverters possible for EVs applications which include the\ntwo main directions of soft switching inverters: input side approach and load\nside approach .  \n\n\n 3. CLASSIFICATIONS OF SOFT SWITCHING POWER\nINVERTERS  \n\n \n\nThe first soft switching inverters was published by D.M . Divan\nin 1986 (  6 ) .\n\n\nIt was called Resonant DC Link (  RDCL ) inverter .\n\n\nIt belongs to input aide approach .\n\n\nBasically , RDCL inverters set the dc link voltage into oscillation\nso that zero voltage instants are created periodically for zero voltage\nswitching (  ZVS ) .\n\n\nAlthough this soft switching approach can offer potential advantage ,\nRDCL circuit results in an increase in circuit complexity and the frequency\nspectrum is restricted by the need of using integral pulse density modulation\n( IPDM ) when compared with a standard hard switching inverter .\n\n\nIn addition , the peak pulsating link voltage of resonant ling\ninverters is twice of the dc link voltage in a standard hard switching\ninverter .\n\n\nTo reduce this peak voltage and other drawbacks of the first\ngeneration of RDCL inverter , a number of improved topologies had been\npublished in the last decade .\n\n\nAlmost of them considered a resonant circuit to be placed in-between\nthe dc input and the inverter , such as quasi-resonant dc link (  QRDCL ) , and\nclamped resonant dc link (  CRDCL ) inverters .\n\n\nIt is defined as input side approach . Recently , another topology\nnamed auxiliary resonant snubber (  ARS ) inverter had been proposed which was\ndifferent from others .\n\n\nThe resonant circuit was placed in the load side with the inverter\ncircuit , not in the dc link .\n\n\nIt is defined as load side approach .\n\n\nTable 3 shows the classification of soft switching inverters by these\ndefinitions of technology .\n\n\nActually , these inverters can be re-grouped by operation ,\napplication and modulation technique .   \n\n\n3.1 Features of Existing Inverters  \n\n \n\nAlmost published ZVS soft switching inverters were listed in\nTable 3 .\n\n\nTheir features and drawbacks are summarized below . \n\n \n\n  Resonant DC Link (  RDCL ) Inverter (  6,7 ) . \n\n\n\nIt is one of the most promising inverters because of its simplicity ,\nbut it impresses substantial voltage stresses (  about 2.5 supply voltage)\nacross the devices . \n\n \n\n  Quasi Resonant DC Link (  QRDCL ) Inverter (  8,9,20 ) .\n \n\n\nGenerally , it is a relative simple resonant circuit .\n\n\nIt consists of two switches , an inductor , and a capacitor .\n\n\nFor resonant operation , it requires a large capacitor which can keep\na nearly constant voltage during the resonant cycle .\n\n\nIn addition , it is difficult to keep the voltage near half of input\nvoltage at all the operational regions and the energy of the resonant circuit\nis not zero for the steady state .\n\n\nIt should also include a current initialization circuit and the dc\nlink voltage is increased up to 2 times of input voltage . \n\n \n\n  Serious Resonant DC Link (  SrRDCL ) Inverter ( \n11,12,13 ) .  \n\n\nActually , it is the duality of parallel resonant dc link inverter .\n\n\nThe switching occurs at zero current instants .\n\n\nHowever , irregular current peaks appear when the output voltage\nchanges suddenly , as similar to voltage peak problem of the parallel\nresonant inverter , which will be discussed in sub-session 1.1.2 .\n\n\nThe difficulty with the series resonant type was solved with a simple\nsaturable core to limit the current peaks .\n\n\nA pulse split concept was introduced which make the current control\nscheme more complicated .\n\n\nThis kind of inverter was suitable for induction motor drive . \n\n \n\n  Parallel Resonant DC Link (  PRDCL ) Inverter ( \n14,15,16 ) .  \n\n\nIt needs three additional switches for pulse-width-modulation (  PWM)\noperations .\n\n\nThus , the resonant circuit becomes somewhat complex and its control\nis not easy .\n\n\nAlso , commutation losses of the additional switches are serious\nproblems .\n\n\nIt uses an inductor as a resonant energy storage element , and can\noperate without a resonant capacitor .\n\n\nOn the other hand , because the energy needed to null the link\nvoltage is stored only in an inductor , the peak current of the inductor is\nsomewhat higher .\n\n\nDuring zero link voltage period , this produces a high conduction\nloss and prevents a perfect PWM operation .\n\n\nIn addition , for PWM operation it needs three additional switches\nand two of three switches are turned on under zero current condition .\n\n\nThus , this suffers from the switching stresses resulting form the\ndevice parasitic capacitor . \n\n \n\n  Synchronized Resonant DC Link (  SRDCL ) Inverter ( \n17,18 ) .  \n\n\nIt realizes the soft switching PWM with only one additional switch .\n\n\nHowever , the peak voltage of the dc link is higher than the supply\nvoltage (  about 15 ~ 1.8 supply voltage ) and this inverter experiences high\nconduction losses because the inductor current is not zero during the steady\nstate .\n\n\nMoreover , PWM operation is much limited by idle time after every\ncommutation . \n\n \n\n  Clamped Resonant DC Link (  CRDCL ) Inverter . \n\n\n\nIt requires a clamped circuit to pull down the dc link voltage as\nclose as the dc input voltage .\n\n\nIt consists of two main type of clamped circuits , namely actively\nclamped and passively clamped resonant dc link inverters . \n\n \n\n  Actively Clamped Resonant DC Link (  ACRDCL ) Inverter\n[ 19 ) .  \n\n\nIt is known as one of the most successful topologies with only one\nadditional devices and covers 1-40kW power range around 20-60 kHz switching\nfrequency range .\n\n\nHowever , it still has a lot of problems such as device voltage\nstresses are high as 1.3 - 1.5 of input voltage , high conduction loss in\nresonant inductor .\n\n\nA big obstacle of ACRDCL is that its power range is limited by\nsubharmonic and discrete pulse modulation (  DPM ) . \n\n \n\n  Passively Clamped Resonant DC Link (  PCRDCL ) Inverter .\n \n\n\nIt requires passive elements to be a clamped circuit to pull down the\ndc link voltage as close as the dc supply voltage . \n\n \n\n  Passively Clamped Quasi-Resonant Link (  PCQRL)\nInverter (  20,21 ) .  \n\n\nIt has advantage of low clamped factor (  down to 1.1 - 1.3 of input\nvoltage ) , simple resonant control , guaranteed zero link voltage condition\nand PWM capabilities .\n\n\nHowever , the penalties are relatively high device count associated\nwith auxiliary switched inductor circuit , and the high reverse voltage\nrequirement for the clamp diode .\n\n\nIt requires a pair of coupled inductors to reduce the number of\nadditional switches . \n\n \n\n  Resonant Transition (  RT ) Inverter (  22 ) . \n\n\n\nIt requires many transitions to achieve desired state changes .\n\n\nIt also requires clamping devices to prevent over-voltage across the\nauxiliary resonant switch during resonant current resetting . \n\n \n\n  Auxiliary Resonant Commutated Pole (  ARCP ) Inverter ( \n23,24 ) .  \n\n\nIt requires a stiff dc link capacitor bank which is center tapped to\naccomplish commutation .\n\n\nAlthough it reduces the current stresses and losses in the devices\nand components , it is thought to be not cost effective at below 200kW power\nlevel because of the large number of additional devices (  6 devices ) . \n\n \n\n  Auxiliary Resonant Snubber (  ARS ) Inverter . \n\n\n\nIt is the one put the auxiliary switches in the load side such that\nthe power rating of the auxiliary switches are able to be as small as\none-tenth of the main switches .\n\n\nIt consists of two main types: star-configured and delta-configured\nauxiliary resonant snubber inverters . \n\n \n\n  Star-configured Auxiliary Resonant Snubber (  SC-ARS)\nInverter (  25,26 ) .  \n\n\nIt is similar to the resonant transition inverter and it requires a\nclamping diode or resonant current sensors along with a precise control to\nprevent over-voltage across the auxiliary resonant switch . \n\n \n\n  Delta-configured Auxiliary Resonant Snubber ( \nDC-ARS ) Inverter (  27,28 ) .  \n\n\nIt overcomes the drawbacks of the resonant transition inverters and\nSC-ARS inverters .\n\n\nIt does not have penalty of floating voltage or over-voltage on the\nauxiliary switches .\n\n\nIt does not require any antiparallel fast recovery diodes across the\nresonant switches .   \n\n\n3.2 Operation  \n\n \n\nThose published soft switching inverters listed in Table 3 can\nbe classified according to their operating principles .\n\n\nEven though they all are claimed that they are in ZVS , it is only\ntrue for the inverter circuit .\n\n\nFor resonant circuit and the additional switches , they are not all\nin ZVS and still carry a resonant circuit as high as the load current ,\nespecially for those topologies with input side approach .\n\n\nTheir power rating of these auxiliary switches are the same as the\nswitches in inverter circuit .\n\n\nFor inverter circuit , some of them make the dc link voltage to be\nzero when switches in inverter circuit take action , it is called link zero\nmode , while some make either upper or lower part of the leg to be zero when\nswitches in inverter take action .\n\n\nIt is called device zero mode .\n\n\nTable 4 summarized these inverters by their operating principle .\n  \n\n\n3.3 Applications  \n\n \n\nThose published ZVS soft switching inverters listed in Table 3\ncan also be classified according to their applications which are dependent on\ntheir power range , device types and switching frequency .\n\n\nThese result in suitability of EVs applications .\n\n\nGenerally , switching losses would be increased as the switching\nfrequency increases .\n\n\nTo basic EVs applications , the dc link voltage should be kept as\nclose as the input voltage .\n\n\nTable 5 shows the suitability of these inverters for EVs purposes .\n  \n\n\n3.4 Modulation  \n\n \n\nModulation technique is one of the major concerns in the\ndevelopment of soft switching inverters .\n\n\nIt results in suitabilities of motor types for drive purposes and\nproduction of harmonic contents .\n\n\nActually , there are two directions of modulations in soft-switching\ninverters .\n\n\nOne is when ZVS occurs at fixed time intervals , while another one\nif when ZVS occurs momentarily .\n\n\nThe former one is only suitable for delta and sigma-delta modulation\ntechniques (  29 ) .\n\n\nFor well established PWM operation , the switches in inverter\ncircuit must be operated when it is required .\n\n\nTable 5 also summarized the modulation techniques associated with\nthe soft switching inverters .   \n\n\n4. COMPARSIONS OF SOFT SWITCHING INVERTERS FOR\nEVS  \n\n \n\nAccording to Tables 4 and 5 , competent soft switching inverters\nfor EVs purposes will be shortlisted .\n\n\nComparison of these soft switching inverters will be made .\n\n\nBasically , there are a lot of requirement for inverters in the\napplications of EVs .\n\n\nThe following sub-sessions will list the requirement and then\ncomment on the shortlisted inverters , based on their merits and special\nfeatures such as power rating , device count , and device type , with point\ngrading system .   \n\n\n4.1 Special Requirements for EVs  \n\n \n\nTo be a contender against the conventional internal combustion\nengine (  ICE ) vehicles , the electric propulsion drive system in EVs must\ndemonstrate its superiority in the following areas . ?\n\n\nPower Rating .\n\n\n- High instant power .\n\n\n- High power density . \n\n\nTorque-Speed Characteristics .\n\n\n- High torque at low speed for starting and climbing.\n\n\n- High speed at low torque for cruising.\n\n\n- Wide speed range including constant torque and constant power\nregions .\n\n\n- Fast torque response . \n\n\nEfficiency.\n\n\n- High efficiency over wide speed and torque ranges , generally\nhigher than 95% for fill speed and higher than 80% at low\nspeed . \n\n\nRobustness. \n\n\nReliability.\n\n\n- No failure before the end of the vehicle life . \n\n\nCost .    4.2 Power Devices for EVs  \n\n \n\nAn evaluation of power device for electric propulsion is given\nin Table 6 in which a grading system is so adapted that each of the device\ncharacteristics is graded from 0 to 5 points .\n\n\nAlthough it seems that the IGBT provides the best performance , the\npower MOSFET has also been accepted for many electric propulsion systems ,\nespecially for relatively low power bikes and electric tricycles .\n\n\nWhen the MCT becomes commercially available at reasonable cost , it\nis likely to be the best .    4.3 Special Requirement of Soft\nSwitching Inverters for EVs  \n\n \n\nAn evaluation of the shortlisted soft switching inverters is\nalso in Table 7 in which the same grading system is so adapted that each of\nthe inverter characteristics is graded .\n\n\nThere are three main directions for ac drives , namely induction\nmotor (  IM ) , permanent magnet brushless motor (  PMBM ) , and switched\nreluctance motor (  SRM ) .\n\n\nThese inverters are also evaluated for the suitability of these\nmotor drive systems .\n\n\nAlthough it seems that the SC-ARS provides the best overall\nperformance , DC-ARS can overcome the drawbacks of SC-ARS .\n\n\nThe rest of inverters seem fairly acceptable for EVs applications .\n\n\nHowever , its original design of RT is for rectifier , it may not be\nmature for commercially EVs market .\n\n\nSrRDCL was proposed to use of GTO as the main device , this in turn\ndeficits its competition in terms of power rating , thermal effect and\ncost-effectiveness .   \n\n\n5. POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS OF INVERTERS FOR EVS  \n\n \n\nThe advancement of power electronics plays a dominant role to\nthe development of soft switching inverters .\n\n\nThe competence and rapid development of IGBT , power MOSFET and MCT\ntend to be more specific and tailor-made for EVs applications .\n\n\nThis will further reduce the production cost and improve the\nefficiency and performance of the inverters .\n\n\nMoreover , soft switching inverters for EVs have been proved for ac\ndrive system in EVs which includes following tests . \n\n\nDistortion . \n\n\nWaveform Analysis . \n\n\nRipple . \n\n\nOutput dv/dt . \n\n\nPhrase Symmetry . \n\n \n\nFurthermore , the power rating of the inverters in EVs also\ndemonstrates that soft switching techniques is superior than conventional\nhard switching one , in terms of conduction loss , switching loss ,\nefficiency , EMI and acoustic problems .\n\n\nTable 8 shows the power rating of inverters for different types of\nEVs , namely sedan , light-weighted van , pick-up truck , and commercial\npassenger buses .\n\n\nFor these range of power rating , efficiency of soft-switching\ninverters is normally higher than hard switching inverters .   \n\n\n6. SOFT SWITCHING INVERTERS / CONVERTERS FOR EVS  \n\n \n\nOther than propulsion system in EVs , soft switching inverters\nare also suitable for all power conversion in EVs such as accessory power\nsupply .\n\n\nSince EVs do not have an alternator , many auxiliary system must\ndepend on the battery system to supply the necessary power .\n\n\nFor example , air conditioning , power steering and radios are just\nsome accessories that will have to rely on a converter/inverter to provide\npower from a battery system input as high as 200-400 Vdc range .\n\n\nThe following accessory are dependent on high-efficiency converter\ninverter . \n\n\nConvert to 0 - 180 Vac for air conditioning compressor . \n\n\nConvert to 24 Vdc for special purpose needs . \n\n\nConvert to 14.25 Vdc for power steering , headlamps , stereo system\n, etc .   \n\n\n7. CONCLUSION  \n\n \n\nA comprehensive study of published soft switching inverters has\nbeen reported .\n\n\nThey have been classified by different characteristics , by topology\n, operation and modulation .\n\n\nSome of them are suitable for high power ac drives system such as\nEVs application .\n\n\nA shortlisted inverters are proposed for further consideration to\napply for power train system in future EVs .\n\n\nThey have been graded by special requirement of EVs .\n\n\nARS type seems to be outstanding but it cannot adopt well\nestablished PWM technique and apply for IM drive .\n\n\nThe rest of inverters are fairly similar to each other .\n\n\nSo far these cannot demonstrate their ability to high power ac drive\nsystem for EVs .\n\n\nFinally , other applications of soft switching in EVs are proposed\nfor further development .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "35fd0065-8914-4414-a47e-47eb9948d5cf", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.049610+00:00"}

Miss Malaysia\n1983  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Cheers , my dears   \n\n\nHong Kong  ' s first cheerleading competition is certainly bringing out\nplenty of perky energy among enthusiastic Britney Spears wannabes .\n\n\n Lim Li Min  and  Natalie Kan  feel better\njust watching the giggling young ladies \n\n \n\nIN a holding room at a Causeway Bay hotel , 28 girls in scarlet\ntank tops and white skirts prepare for Hong Kong  ' s first cheerleading\ncompetition .\n\n\nThey have practised hard for this , and only the last-minute make-up\nflurries and nervous giggles betray just how high feelings are running . \n\n \n\nThe prizes are tasty: there  ' s a &dollar;1,000 in cash for the\nsecond runner-up; &dollar;2,000 for the first runner-up , and for the winning\ncheerleader , &dollar;3,000 plus a two year modelling contract with the\ntalent agency Stareasy .\n\n\nBut behind the surface , there  ' s much more than the allure of hard\ncash and a covergirl reign at stake . \n\n \n\nTwo weeks ago , the majority of the girls were \" newbies\" ,\nfresh acolytes in the world of high kicks and pom-poms .\n\n\nMost have never performed in public; a few have mimicked Britney\nSpears , but only in the privacy of their bedrooms . \n\n \n\nTonight , they stand to rack up a fifth of their total marks .\n\n\nThe final tally comes after the competition draws to a close at the\nweekend in Victoria Park .\n\n\nThe girls will be awarded points for their enthusiasm , routine ,\nsmile and presentation .\n\n\nBut the bulk of what they know about cheerleading will have been\ngleaned from watching corn-fed blonds do rah-rah choruses in American movies .\n\n\n \n\nSome eight two-hour practice sessions later and ready or not ,\nthese girls - mostly local , timid and not used to attention-drawing displays\nof behaviour - will have to step into the spotlight and claim these\nmade-in-the-USA chants and dance steps as their won .  \n\n \n\n\" I  ' m thrilled that we  ' re working together as a team ,\nand we  ' re going to be just perfect , &rdquo; enthuses Deanne Siqueira ,\ndirector of the New York Fitness gym , where the girls have trained . \n\n \n\nThen she flashes a megawatt smile and hollers: \" Everybody\nready to rock and roll ?\n\n\n Then give yourself a pom-pom  ! &rdquo;\n\n\nIt  ' s 15 minutes before they  ' re ready to go on , and the girls are\nwaving their silver pom-poms in the air like their lives depended on it .\n \n\n \n\nThe air is heady with the faint smell of perspiration and scent .\n\n\nThere  ' s glitter dust everywhere - the girls are encouraged to be\ninnovative with their costumes .\n\n\nSo an imaginative lass is sporting a dog collar made of sparkling\nsequins; lots of girls have attached a silver band to the hems of their tops;\none has a bejewelled navel ring .\n\n\n\" Oh my God , I  ' m so glittery , I  ' m like Barbie ! &rdquo;\ngiggles Patricia Chiu , 18 , as she brushes past leaving a cloud of sparkles .\n\n\n \n\nThe girls ' Australian coach and New York Fitness trainer ,\nSamantha Robinson nods and beams for her final pep talk .\n\n\n\" You know the routine .\n\n\nIf you make a mistake , don't worry .\n\n\nHave fun , smile , and everybody will think you look fantastic  ' cause\nyou do ! &rdquo; she says . \n\n \n\nThen it  ' s the breathless five-minute wait behind the curtains\nbefore they come onto the hotel nightclub  ' s dancefloor .\n\n\nA Mexican wave of chimp-like hoots is already bouncing across the\nroom . \" Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-OOH ! , &rdquo; it goes .\n\n\nAnd then the girls are off , knelling on the floor in position , then\nrising to their feet and extending their pom-pom-ed arms to a mixed\ncompilation of  It  ' s Raining Men  , Ricky Martin and  Let  ' s\nGet Loud  at eardrum-shattering levels . \n\n \n\nAnd the result ?\n\n\nIt  ' s decidedly mixed bag .\n\n\nThe best three girls are lined up in front , going through the\nmotions with professional ease , grinning like Cheshire cats and eyeballing\nthe judges confidently .\n\n\nThe desired effect , like their bum-skimming skirts and modest tank\ntops (  showing a little puppy fat ) is sexy , yet wholesome at the same time .\n\n\nLikewise with the shoulder shimmying and buttocks wiggling athletics\n- it  ' s meant to be titillating , but not overtly so .\n\n\nThe stragglers are at the back , wooden , awkward and concentrating\nvery hard .\n\n\nOne , to put it bluntly , looks as if she  ' s just stepped off a\nhorse; the other has her young , unblemished brow puckered up with the sheer\neffort of it all .\n\n\nThis is a definite no-no in cheerleading circles . \n\n \n\n\" You want them to look as if they  ' re definitely into it .\n\n\nNo nervousness .\n\n\nYou  ' re supposed to whip up enthusiasm , &rdquo; says one of the\njudges , Derek Yeung , CEO of she.com .\n\n\nThere are five male judges , all tapping their pens just as\nenthusiastically , and one lone female judge who looks as if , she too , is\nconcentrating very hard .\n\n\nShe is jotting down notes assiduously .\n\n\nYou wonder what  ' s going through the judges ' minds . \n\n \n\nIs the pen-tapping , like the note-taking , a professional\ncover-up , for what is admittedly tame fare ?\n\n\nUnlike American cheerleading , which features feats of acrobatics ,\nthis is more a Mickey Mouse Club affair - with the added glitter dust and\npom-poms , of course . \n\n \n\nThe United States is the undisputed home of cheerleading .\n\n\nThe bible of the cheer world ,  American Cheerleader \nmagazine , is ready by more than 1.3 million teenage girls .\n\n\nNinety-five per cent of cheerleaders are female but there are some\ndedicated males who also do a combination of \" double nines , hurdlers\nand pikes\" .\n\n\nRobinson knows all this but is proud of how far her girls have come .\n \n\n \n\n\" The girls are just fantastic now , &rdquo; she says .\n\n\n\" You should have seen them when they started , how some of\nthem had two left feet ! &rdquo; \n\n \n\nIn a minute , the dance routine is over , and the girls pile\nupstairs , exhausted and red-faced .\n\n\nChiu , who was all hyped up and pumped before the show , is now\npooped , and glides across the room with a slightly glazed look in her eyes .\n\n\nKoryl Schneyder , 22 , who used to cheerlead at her American high\nschool , gasps: \" My mouth was dry and I couldn't breathe . &rdquo;\n\n\n \n\nA quick run around the room reveals modest aspirations; Connie\nChow , part-time model and the current favourite to win the competition ,\nsays she joined because she \" wanted to keep fit\" .\n\n\nLikewise with Jaja Poon , 21 , a Form 5 graduate and full-time model .\n\n\n\" I like it here because all the girls are very nice .\n\n\nI like the contest - it  ' s fun and I want to have lots more fun .\n\n\nIt  ' s not enough ! &rdquo; she giggles . \n\n \n\nAlmost half the girls seem to have done some camera work or\ncat-walk modelling , but none , strangely enough , will admit to knowing what\nthe glittering stakes are . \n\n \n\n\" I joined this for fun - I haven't even thought about\nbecoming famous , &rdquo; Poon says , wrinkling up her pert nose . \n\n \n\n\" Like , whatever , &rdquo; as Kirsten Dunst , who played\na cheerleader in the film  Bring It On  , might say .\n\n\nThe world  ' s celebrity cheersters include Madonna , Franklin D\nRoosevelt , Samuel L Jackson , Ronald Reagan , Sandra Bullock .\n\n\nFor tonight , the girls are in good company . \n\n \n\n The Beach Volleyball Cheerleading Competition finals take\nplace on Saturday , 6:30-8:30pm , and Sunday at 10am and 1.30pm , at Victoria\nPark , Causeway Bay , as part of the Hong Kong Women  ' s Open 2001 beach\nvolleyball championship", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "3b82d402-62c6-46ab-88a3-c98e8e4c5683", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.051370+00:00"}

{"text": "Introduction of a Switched-Capacitor Based Boost Converter\n \n\n\n Y.C . Wong \n\n\nDept. of Electrical and Communications Engineering , Hong Kong\nTechnical College (  Tsing Yi ) , 20 Tsing Yi Road , Tsing Yi , Hong Kong\n\n \n\nAbstract .\n\n\nA new type of switching-mode power supply , which contains no devices\n, is described .\n\n\nBy avoiding inductors or transformers , the power supply presents high\npower density , small size and low weight .\n\n\nThe controlled energy conversion is realized by using\nswitched-capacitors .\n\n\nThe switching frequency is fixed and the driving signals of the\nexternally-controlled switchers are dictated by the feedback circuit of PWM\ntype. \n\n\n 1 . Introduction \n\n \n\nAt present , most of the available DC-to-DC converters have small\npower density due to the presence of inductors and transformers in their\nbasic structure .\n\n\nIncreasing the switching frequency solved only partially the problem .\n\n\n \n\nIn order to realize DC power supplies of small size and low\nweight , magnetic elements have been replaced by controllable\nswitched-capacitor (  SC ) circuits  1-3  .\n\n\nThe early SC-based DC-to-DC converters had limited capacity of\nproducing a constant output voltage for large changes in the load or even\nsmall changes in the input voltage .\n\n\nHere , the operation of another SC-based DC-to-DC step-up converter ( \n6V/9V ) is described . \n\n\n 2 . Converter Structure \n\n \n\nThe new converter (  Fig.1 ) contains two switched-capacitor\ncircuits , each one formed by a capacitor (  C  1  or C  2 \n, both of the same value C ) and two externally controlled switches (  S  1\n , S,  3  and S  2  , S  4  respectively ) .\n\n\nThey are operated in anti-symmetry , interchanging from a charging\nprocess to a discharging one in each half-cycle .\n\n\nConsequently , in each half cycle , one of the two capacitors\nprovides the energy to the load .\n\n\nThe output voltage is given by the sum between the input voltage and\nthe voltage across the capacitor connected to the load .\n\n\nFor ensuring a very small ripple in the output voltage , an\nadditional capacitor , C  0  , is permanently connected in parallel\nto the load .  \n\n\n 3 . Converter Operator \n\n \n\nThe behavior of the externally controlled switches is dictated by\nthe driving signals shown in Fig.2 .\n\n\nAccordingly , in each half-cycle , one switch is in  ' ON ' position ,\nand another one changes from the  ' ON ' position to the  ' OFF ' position ,\ndetermining two switching stages per half-cycle .\n\n\nThe time in which the main switch conducts (  S  1  for the\nfirst half-cycle and S  2  for the second half-cycle ) is denoted by\nT  on  .\n\n\nThe feedback circuit , of PWM type , operates in such a way , as to\nadjust by T  on  .\n\n\nConsequently , the output voltage is kept constant despite variations\nin the input voltage or load by changing the duration of the charging phase\nin each half-cycle .\n\n\nThe switching frequency , f  s  , and as a consequence the\nswitching period , T  s  (  T  s  =1/f  s   ) is\nkept constant . \n\n \n\nAccording to the driving diagram , the power stage goes through\nfour switching topologies in each cycle (  Fig.3 ) .\n\n\nIn the first one , capacitor C  1  is charged until the\nvalue V  Cmax  , and capacitor C  2  begins its discharge\non the load from its initial value V  Cmax  (  Fig . 4 ) .\n\n\nThis value has been reached at the end of the third state in the\nprevious cycle .\n\n\nDuring the second cyclical state , C  1  is disconnected and\nC  2  continues its discharging .\n\n\nAt the end of the state <space> , the voltage across C  2 \nreaches the values V  Cmin  .\n\n\nThe output voltage , V  L  is given by the sum between the\nsource voltage , V  1  , and the voltage across the discharging\ncapacitor C  2  .\n\n\nIn the second half-cycle the process is repeated , with C  1\n and C  2  interchanging their roles. \n\n \n\nThe design of the capacitor values , C  1  and C  2\n , and of the half-cycle duration (  T  s  / 2 ) is accomplished\nin such a way as to keep the difference between V  Cmax  and V \nCmin  at a small value , thus ensuring high efficiency and small output\nripple .\n\n\nThe ripple in the output voltage is further smoothed by capacitor C\n 0  . V  Cmax  is a bit smaller than V  1   .\n\n\n\n(  Each charging circuit , either in state 1 or state 3 , is formed by\nthe line voltage , a diode , a switch and the charging capacitor .\n\n\nV  Cmax  cannot reach V  1  due to the voltage  drops on the parasitic resistance of the switch , capacitor and\nthe forward voltage on the diode in conduction , V  D   ) .\n\n\nBy designing the converter in such a way that V  Cmin  has a\nclose value to V  Cmax  , the average input current in the charging\ncircuit is kept minimum , ensuring high efficiency .\n\n\nIts peak is proportional to (  V  1  -V  Cmin   ) .\n \n\n \n\nThe externally controlled switches are driven by DS0026 chips ,\nwhich ensure a reduced delay time at the switches turn on/off , diminishing\nthe switching losses .\n\n\nNo transformations are used in the feedback circuit , to keep with\nthe goal of a magnetic-free regulator . \n\n\n\n\n\n  Quality assurance and testing in the construction industry\n \n\n\nBy Ir C K Cheung\n\n \n\nThe ISO 9000 quality management system (  QMS ) is widely adopted\nby the local construction industry as a means of assuring the quality of its\nactivities , services and products .\n\n\nIn its Technical Circular (  WBTC ) 13/2001 , the Works Bureau (  WB)\nstipulates the policy requirements for certain groups of contactors and\nconsultants who are engaged in public works to be certified to the relevant\nISO models .\n\n\nThe role of the Hong Kong Accreditation Service (  HKAS ) is to confer\nrecognition on certification bodies (  CB ) that are able to demonstrate\ncompliance with necessary requirements; in particular , the ISO Guide 62\n \" General requirements for bodies operating assessment and\ncertification of quality systems\"  . \n\n \n\nThe Hong Kong Certification Body Accreditation Scheme (  HKCAS)\nwas launched by HKAS in 1998 .\n\n\nThe accreditation offered covers a wide spectrum of activities in the\nindustrial and commercial sectors , among which construction is one of the\nbiggest .\n\n\nCurrently there are about 1,600 organisations certified by the CB ,\nof which 500 are construction or related organizations . \n\n \n\nThere is strong criticism by stakeholders and the public that ISO\n9000 places too much attention on paperwork but little emphasis on the\ntechnical aspects .\n\n\nIn an effort to address this concern , the year 2000 version of ISO\n9000 focuses primarily on a process-oriented management system with just\nsufficient paperwork to meet the operation of an organization .\n\n\nThis new ISO also provides the benchmark for total quality management .\n\n\nAuditing has to be performed by competent auditors who possess\nsufficient technical knowledge and who know the essence of the process to be\naudited .\n\n\nAuditing as viewed by stakeholders is a value-added activity and not\njust a pure compliance checking exercise . \n\n \n\nTo meet the expectation of stakeholders and the community at\nlarge , HKAS will continue its endeavour to ensure that certification audits\nare performed to fufil the mission of ISO 9001: 2000. \n\n\n  Quality testing of construction materials  \n\n \n\nUnlike the ISO 9000 series , which ensured the implementation of\na QMS in an organisation , ISO/IEC 17025 focuses on the technical competence\nof laboratories and their ability to produce reliable and accurate test\nresults .\n\n\nIt also provides the basic criteria for accreditation of\norganisations performing testing .\n\n\nThe Hong Kong Laboratory Accreditation Scheme (  HOKLAS ) was\nestablished in 1985 with the objective of giving formal recognition to\ncompetent laboratories who are able to meet the requirements of ISO/IEC 17025 .\nHOKLAS-endorsed test reports have been widely accepted by the industry ,\nsignifying confidence in the accuracy and reliability of test results issued\nby accredited laboratories . \n\n \n\nCurrently , there are about 35 local accredited construction\nmaterials testing laboratories .\n\n\nThe turnover of the construction testing industry amounts to about\nHK&dollar;1 billion per annum .\n\n\nThe number of employees is estimated to be about 1,200 . \n\n\n  Scope of testing  \n\n \n\nThe scope of HOKLAS  ' s accreditation of construction materials\ntesting is wide-ranging and expanding to meet the needs of the industry .\n\n\nThe following are the major categories . \n\n\n  1 . Concrete and its constituent materials  \n\n \n\nWBTC 14/91 and Buildings  Practice Note for\nAuthorised Persons (  PNAP ) 145 requires testing of concrete cubes and cores\nto the Hong Kong Construction Standard CS1:1990 .\n\n\nPNAP 251 further requires such testing to be carried out by\naccredited laboratories .\n\n\nAt peak period , a big laboratory may carry out tests of up to about\n800 cubes per day .\n\n\nTo meet the huge demand , there are about 20 concrete laboratories\naccredited . \n\n \n\nTraditionally , site control tests and sampling , such as slump\nand compacting factor tests to CS1; flow of fresh concrete to BS 1881: Part\n105; and making of concrete cubes to CS1 , etc , were performed by the\ncontractor  ' s site staff .\n\n\nHowever , it has been realised that this may give rise to potential\nconflict of interest .\n\n\nThe Housing Department (  HD ) required all site testing to be\nperformed by an independent accredited laboratory .  \n\n \n\nTo produce high quality concrete , it is necessary to have good\nquality constituent materials such as cement , pulverised fuel ash (  PFA ) and\naggregates .\n\n\nAbout 10 concrete laboratories also have accreditation for these\ntests . \n\n\n  2 . Steel  \n\n \n\nSteel is the second largest testing item after concrete and there\nare 14 laboratories accredited for steel testing .\n\n\nRoutine tests are often in the form of reinforcement bars for tensile\n, bend and rebend test .\n\n\nWBTC 24/95 and PNAP 122 stipulate requirements for rebars testing to\nCS2: 1995 and PNAP 251 further reinforced such requirements .\n\n\nOwing to its low weight and high strength , structural steel in the\nform of H piles is nowadays very often used .\n\n\nIt has to meet technical specifications detailed in BS 4360 . \n\n\n  3 . Bituminous materials  \n\n \n\nAccredited tests on bituminous materials include the\ndetermination of binder content , theoretical specific gravity , bulk\nspecific gravity and determination of voids .\n\n\nThere are eight laboratories accredited , of which four are asphalt\n own quality control laboratories , one is a government\nlaboratory and three are commercial laboratories .\n\n\nTests are carried out in accordance with ASTM D2171 , D2041 , D2276\nand D3203 . \n\n\n  4 . Building components  \n\n \n\nCertain types of building components are required to be tested\nfor their safety and serviceability .\n\n\nAccredited tests include pipe tests for strength and leakage; brick\nand block tests for strength; door tests for resistance to impact and\njarring; cooking bench and sink unit tests for strength and localised\nheating; pullout tests of tiles and anchor bolts and bending tests of facing\nstones , etc .\n\n\nThese tests are mainly required by HD for public housing projects .\n\n\nThere are four laboratories accredited to carry out these tests in\naccordance with HD requirements . \n\n \n\nCurtain walls for wind resistance tests to PNAP 106 are required\nin accordance with PNAP 251 .\n\n\nFour laboratories are accredited to perform this test .\n\n\nRecently , one laboratory is accredited to perform fire resistance\ntests on doors , partition walls and non-load bearing elements to BS 476:\nPart 20 and 22 . PNAP 251 stipulates mandatory requirements for testing by\naccredited laboratories .\n\n\nHOKLAS Supplementary Criteria No17 provides details of the technical\nrequirements for building components testing . \n\n\n 5 .  Non-destructive tests (  NDT ) of welds  \n\n \n\nNDT is diagnostic in nature and is used to detect any possible\nweld defects .\n\n\nCommon tests are ultrasonic to BS 3923 &ampersand; BS EN 1714; radiographic to\nBS 2600 , BS 2910 and BS EN 1435; magnetic to BS 6072 and BS EN 1290; and\npenetrant to BS 6443 and BS EN 571-1 .\n\n\nIn line with international practices for NDT , personnel requirements\nare stipulated .\n\n\nApproved HOKLAS signatories have to be certified to Level 3 of the\nAmerican Society for Nondestructive Testing (  ASNT ) or the Personnel\nCertification of Nondestructive tests (  PCN ) of the UK .\n\n\nSimilarly , approved HOKLAS operators have to be certified to Level\n2 of the ASNT or PCN .\n\n\nThere are seven laboratories accredited for NDT of welds .\n\n\nHOKLAS Supplementary Criteria No15 gives the technical requirements .\n\n\n\n  6 . Soil and rock  \n\n \n\nThe GEO Report No 36 for Phase I soil tests has been replaced by\nthe newly published Geospec 3,which encompasses both Phase I soil\nclassification and compaction tests as well as Phase II soil compressibility\nand strength tests . WBTC 6/94 and PNAP 167 will be amended accordingly .\n\n\nThere are 13 laboratories accredited for Phase I soil tests .\n\n\nAccreditation for Phase II soil tests according to Geospec 3 is now\nunderway .\n\n\nRock testing mainly follows ASTM D2216 , D5731 , D2938 and D5687 on\nclassification , shear strength of rock joints , point load and uniaxial\ncompression tests .\n\n\nA HOKLAS Supplementary Criteria No19 is issued delineating the\ntechnical requirements . \n\n\n  7 . Foundation  \n\n \n\nThe short pile scandal sparked widespread public concern over\nthe issue of inadequate quality control on foundation works .\n\n\nAs advocated by the Construction Industry Review Committee , the\ndeployment of independent laboratories to perform foundation compliance tests\nwill undoubtedly help strengthen the confidence of the public in the\nintegrity of foundation works .\n\n\nWBTC 22/2000 spells out the requirements for integrity tests for\npile foundation .\n\n\nAccredited tests include sonic logging , pile integrity , pile\ndynamic , echo sounder , plate load and static load tests , etc .\n\n\nThere are eight laboratories accredited for these tests .\n\n\nHOKLAS Supplementary Criteria No16 details the technical\nrequirements . \n\n\n  New scheme for construction products inspection (  HKIAS)\n \n\n \n\nIn an attempt to provide further assurance for the procurement\nof construction products , HKAS will launch a new scheme under the Hong Kong\nInspection Body Accreditation Scheme (  HKIAS ) , to accredit inspection bodies\nfor construction products , in early 2002 .\n\n\nThis new scheme will focus on the technical inspection of procured\nproducts against client  ' s specifications during manufacturing and/or\npre-shipping by competent HKIAS-approved technical inspectors .\n\n\nAccreditation of inspection bodies will be in accordance with ISO\n17020 . \n\n \n\nThe world is now entering an era of rapid transformation .\n\n\nGiven China  ' s accession to the World Trade Organisation and the\nopportunity resulting from globalisation , multilaterally recognized\naccreditation services will make a significant contribution to Hong Kong  ' s\nability to keep up with its trading partners .\n\n\nIn this connection , HKAS has a significant role to play , by\nmaintaining a credible and efficient accreditation service to enhance the\nquality of our building products and to strengthen our competitiveness in the\nglobal market . \n\n \n\n About the author: Ir C K Cheung is a senior accreditation\nofficer of the Hong Kong Accreditation Service .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "7c930f26-9b0e-44d9-8d7a-16246555abc8", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.054156+00:00"}
{"text": "Put an end to dreaded dictation   \n\n\n OPEN FORUM   \n\n\n Tsui Hon-kwong  \n\n \n\nEnglish dictation is what school children dread most .\n\n\nParents loathe it too .\n\n\nI have a friend who often weeps together with her son over the\ndictation he is preparing for the next day . It is an impossible task .\n\n\nIt is useless , too .\n\n\nChildren hate English from the first month in Primary One onwards\nbecause of it .\n\n\nThis could be a root cause of the low English standard in Hong Kong ,\nespecially among children from poorer backgrounds , despite eight English\nlessons per week for 11 years . \n\n \n\nDictation is conducted once a week in an average primary school .\n\n\nChildren must remember the spelling of words from two to six pages of\na textbook .\n\n\nThe teacher reads out about 10 sentences , repeating them once or\ntwice .\n\n\nThe children write them down .\n\n\nFive marks are deducted for every wrong word .\n\n\nYou get zero for 20 mistakes . \n\n \n\nThere is little teaching of dictation or spelling .\n\n\nParents make 80 per cent of the effort in helping children , the\nschool barely 20 per cent .\n\n\nLittle phonetic sense is taught by parents or schools .\n\n\nMost children get by through rote memorisation of what are to them\njust random letters .\n\n\nThe less educated the parents , the more hopeless the chore . \n\n \n\nHong Kong children are forced to learn three things\nsimultaneously for every new word: the pronunciation , the meaning (  and\nassociated usage and grammar ) , and the writing system . \n\n \n\nBritish and American children already speak the language when\nthey come to spell the words .\n\n\nSpanish , Vietnamese , Russian , Korean or Arabic children are\nfamiliar with a phonetic writing system of their native language by the time\nthey have to spell English words . \n\n \n\nChildren on the mainland and in Taiwan are taught an auxiliary\nphonetic writing system for Chinese in lower primary school .\n\n\nThey have at least a clue as to why those few English letters make up\nthat English sound . \n\n \n\nOnly Hong Kong children must learn English pronunciation , its\nmeaning and , in the form of dictation , English spelling without any\nknowledge of phonetics . \n\n \n\nChinese dictation is far more humane .\n\n\nThere are only the strokes and the shapes to remember , not\npronunciation and meaning , most of which they already know .\n\n\nEnglish spelling is taught the way it is because this is what\nliteracy has meant for thousands of years in China - to recognise the written\nword .\n\n\nWithout being conscious of it , Hong Kong schools and parents apply\nthe principle of remembering the strokes to English .\n\n\nLetters are nothing more than  gweilo  strokes that form\n gweilo  words . \n\n \n\nDictation is just one manifestation of the problem .\n\n\nPronunciation of the written word is another scourge .\n\n\nMany children , if they read English at all , can read only silently .\n\n\nMany children cannot read a passage aloud properly even though they\ncan comprehend some of its meaning .\n\n\nThese children will never speak the language , even if they pass the\nCertificate of Education exam . \n\n \n\nNo one takes responsibility .\n\n\nThe English teaching establishment does not see this problem the way\nI do , probably because they haven't read about it in the huge , mostly\nforeign , literature on English-language teaching . \n\n \n\nThe Education Department is absolved since it has already given\nadvice to schools to emphasise reading , listening and speaking in lower\nprimary school .\n\n\nIt is the schools ' fault not to have realised that they may cut down\ndictation . \n\n \n\nSchools , as usual , put parents ' misconceptions on education\nabove their own professional judgement since intake quality is far more\nimportant than teaching quality .\n\n\nTherefore , if parents think literacy means remembering the \ngweilo  strokes , dictation must not be cut . \n\n \n\nThe technical solution is to cut English (  and Chinese ) dictation\naltogether in Primary One , and perhaps Primary Two .\n\n\nThen decide on a consistent phonetic spelling system for Cantonese ,\ntrain the teachers , and teach the children . \n\n \n\nLet Hong Kong children enjoy reading Chinese children  ' s books\nlike their counterparts in the mainland and Taiwan , where every character ,\nthough unfamiliar , can be read aloud in their own tongue from the phonetic\nsymbols beside it . \n\n \n\nLet them start creative writing at six , and put in the phonetic\nversion when they have not mastered a character yet .\n\n\nThen , like Spanish children , let them start spelling English words\nonly after they can spell every classmate  ' s name in English . \n\n \n\nThis approach is better than simply teaching phonics , which does\nnot solve the problem of learning three things at once .\n\n\nBut the technical solution is not the whole solution .\n\n\nWhat we lack most is the resolve to change . \n\n \n\n Tsui Hon-kwong is director of the Hong Kong Professional\nTeachers ' Union  ' s research department  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Scene set for real recovery   \n\n\n After years of being put in the shade of piracy and dwindling\ncinema audiences , Hong Kong  ' s film industry is savouring a revival and\nOscar glory .\n\n\n Ella Lee  reports  \n\n \n\n WHEN THE MAKERS  of hit movie  Crouching Tiger\n, Hidden Dragon  attend the star-studded presentation of the Oscars in\nLos Angeles next month , they will provide Hong Kong  ' s film industry with a\nmuch-needed boost . \n\n \n\nThe martial-arts epic , featuring key contributions from talented\nmembers of the SAR  ' s movie world , was nominated for a record 10 Oscars on\nTuesday , including best film , best foreign film and best director . \n\n \n\nChow Yun-fat , the megastar actor from Lamma Island , plays a\nmaster swordsman who falls in love with a character played by Michelle Yeoh ,\nwho rose to stardom in Hong Kong .\n\n\nYuen Woo-ping , a local veteran martial-arts choreographer , is the\nfilm  ' s stunt director . \n\n \n\nThe Taiwanese movie  ' s success is warmly welcomed by film-makers\nin Hong Kong .\n\n\nBut it is the long queues outside local cinemas - to see this film\nand other blockbusters - which provide the most tangible evidence of a\nrevival in the industry  ' s fortunes . \n\n \n\nOnly two or three years ago , gloom surrounded the local film\nindustry as it plunged into a \" dark age &rdquo; prompted largely by\nthe economic downturn and copyright piracy .\n\n\nCinemas at that time were virtually empty , as many people ditched\nthe idea of paying &dollar;50 or more for a seat and opted for home\nentertainment , sometimes viewing pirated video compact discs costing only\n&dollar;20 each . \n\n \n\nThe number of local films screened in Hong Kong dropped to only\n94 and 92 in 1997 and 1998 respectively , compared with about 200 annually in\nthe early 1990s .\n\n\nLocal films represented only half of all those shown in the SAR .\n\n\nIt was a far cry from the boom of the 1980s , when Hong Kong films\nconstituted 80 per cent of the local film market . \n\n \n\nNow , after enduring the slump , things are at last looking up .\n\n\nThe Hong Kong movie is back . \n\n \n\nThe number of films produced locally , and cinema attendances in\ngeneral , are on the rise .\n\n\nThe number of local films screened rose to 150 last year and\ngenerated box office receipts of &dollar;383 million . \n\n \n\n\" We now have a rebound , although it still a long way from\na full recovery , &rdquo; says Woody Tsung Wan-chi , chief executive of the\nHong Kong Motion Picture Industry Association . \n\n \n\nAlthough box-office figures for local films remain more or less\nthe same , Mr Tsung says the number of people going to watch them is on the\nincrease .\n\n\nThis is not reflected in the box-office receipts because cinemas are\noffering discounted seats for some screenings . \n\n \n\nBuoyed by the optimistic atmosphere , movers and shakers in the\nindustry are calling on the Government to do more to encourage new talent and\nsmall investors .\n\n\nTheir calls are backed by academics . \n\n \n\nHong Kong ranks first in the world in terms of film production\nper capita .\n\n\nBut piracy and the poor quality of many local films almost killed the\nindustry .\n\n\nIn March 1999 , 2,000 people from the local film industry , including\nsuperstars as Jackie Chan , took to the streets to campaign the government\nfor action on piracy .\n\n\nMany local cinemas closed as part of the protest . \n\n \n\nBut Mr Tsung says the industry is now benefiting from an increase\nin demand for local movies , partly fuelled by specialist Web sites .\n\n\nThis has generated handsome revenues for film-makers .\n\n\n\" With the new money , film companies can pay more for good-\nquality scripts .\n\n\nThe atmosphere is getting better .\n\n\nMore people are willing to try out new ideas to attract an audience .\n&rdquo; \n\n \n\nHe says the Asian financial crisis hit the industry badly .\n\n\n\" Two or three years ago , people had no money for movies .\n\n\nThe unemployment rate (  in the local film industry ) reached 70 per\ncent at one point .\n\n\nMany people I know were forced to leave the profession . \n\n \n\n\" Some stunt men became taxi drivers or painters and\ndecorators while some artists have found jobs in newspapers .\n\n\nOf course , we admit that the bad quality of some local films was\nalso a factor leading to the downturn . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe unemployment rate in the industry has since dropped .\n\n\nGovernment figures show the number of people working in the field\nincreased slightly , from 5,129 in 1998 to 5,248 in 1999 .\n\n\nThe value of domestic exports of videotapes and discs rose , from\n&dollar;234 million to &dollar;541 million , during the same period . \n\n \n\nMr Tsung says the crisis has its positive side .\n\n\nIt has motivated film-makers into rethinking their strategy and\nfinding the momentum to survive . \n\n \n\nFor example , first-time director Fruit Chan's  Made in Hong\nKong  , screened in 1997 , was a landmark movie that took advantage of\nthe critical slump period . \n\n \n\nAs a low-cost production , the &dollar;600,000 film was given a\nrare chance to be screened in local theatres , previously dominated by\nmulti-million dollar blockbusters with superstar casts . \n\n \n\nFeaturing unknown actors , the movie was named the Best Film and\nChan the Best Director at the 17th Hong Kong Film Awards in 1998 .\n\n\nOne of the actors , Sam Lee Chan-sam was named Best Newcomer for his\nrole as a troubled young man drawn into a triad society . \n\n \n\nRecently , more local directors and actors have made their names\ninternationally .\n\n\nTony Leung Chiu-wai won the best-actor award at the Cannes Film\nFestival in France last May . Leung , the first Hong Kong actor to win the\naward , was honoured for his role as a cheating and cheated husband in \nIn the Mood for Love  , directed by Wong Kar-wai . \n\n \n\nBut according to Mr Tsung - whose association has more than 160\ncompanies as members - more need to be done to help the industry .\n\n\nThe association has been fighting for more support from the\nGovernment . \n\n \n\nThe Government recently adopted a proposal by the film companies\nto conduct a survey to establish the tastes of Hong Kong cinema-goers . \n\n \n\n\" We see how other governments , such as Korea and Canada\n, have done a lot to help the film industry , &rdquo; says Mr Tsung .\n\n\n\" But in Hong Kong , government efforts are rather piecemeal .\n&rdquo; \n\n \n\nTo answer the repeated calls for help , the SAR Government set\nup the Film Services Office in April 1998 under the Television and\nEntertainment Licensing Authority .\n\n\nThe new office is the first government unit to provide a one-stop\nservice for the industry , ranging from arranging venues for filming ,\nregulating the use of special effects such as explosives , and providing more\ninformation for those involved in the industry . \n\n \n\nA &dollar;100 million Film Development Fund was established in\n1999 as part of Tung Chee-hwa  ' s commitment to boost the industry .\n\n\nThe fund has so far allocated &dollar;23.5 million to 15 projects ,\nincluding training courses for directors and technicians , and sponsorship\nfor young script writers . \n\n \n\nThe authority  ' s assistant commissioner , Helen Tang says the\noffice has helped film-makers overcome hurdles in renting venues for film\ncrews working in busy public areas .\n\n\nThe office negotiated with the Government last year to successfully\nreduce fees for filming along the Mid-Levels escalator from more than\n&dollar;12,000 to about &dollar;4,000 for the first four hours .\n\n\nIt also helped win approval last year for film-makers to use parts\nof the airport and Hunghom railway station for scenes .\n\n\nSome 160 government venues and sites owned by public organisations\nare now open to rental for film production . \n\n \n\nAction-movie hero Jackie Chan has also been involved .\n\n\n\" We have convinced Ocean Park to allow Jackie Chan to film\nits dolphins for the movie  Gorgeous  .\n\n\nHe had planned for the worst - had Ocean Park refused , he would\nhave made the film in Australia , &rdquo; says Ms Tang . \n\n \n\nIt is not uncommon for some film-makers to avoid red tape and\nshoot scenes in busy areas without notifying the authorities . \n\n \n\n\" We have been trying very hard to persuade the related\ndepartments to make a compromise , and with most of them , our efforts work ,\n&rdquo;

{"text": "PREFACE  \n\n\n It is absurd to deny or accept the heading statement without defining the\nmeaning and providing the scope for this topic .\n\n\nThere are three preconditions we need to grasp according to the\nproblem meaning and scope .\n\n\nFirst , it requires our understanding on a democratic political system .\n\n\nIn this regard , many will refer the western type political system as\ndemocratic one or Joseph A. Schumpeter  ' s definition as desirable one .\n\n\n\nThose inferences are not without ground .\n\n\nIn the western culture , there lives a fundamental belief that man is\nsuperior for man has free will .\n\n\nWhen all other species are disciplined by the natural order , man can\nbreak such cocoon and be free .\n\n\nThus , freedom is an unavoidable essence for human existence .\n\n\nWhen this is grounded , the political sphere becomes an arena\nprotecting human freedom .\n\n\nAnd in order to protect everyone  ' s freedom , democracy is an\nunavoidable concept . \n\n\n It can be understood as that division of power is an indivisible part in\npolitics .\n\n\nIf the power is not well-defined or not  \nwell divided  , those have greater power will intrude or influence others  ' \naction .\n\n\nAs a result , freedom is challenged .\n\n\nThus , democracy plays a crucial role in the political system by\nwhich the main essence of democracy is the , respect of human right and\nequality .\n\n\nHere , Joseph A. Schumpeter supplies a desirable and concrete\ndefinition on democratic political system which refers to the extent that the\npolitical system  ' s most powerful collective decision-makers are selected\nthrough periodic elections in which candidates freely compete fare votes and\nin which virtually all the adult population is eligible to vote .\n\n\nThis system will be adopted as the model serving for the analysis of\nthe topic statement .\n\n\n Second , it is assumed that we all get a common set of preconditions for\ndemocratization and basically , we all believe that for democratization ,\nthere must be preconditions .\n\n\nIn order to avoid the mistake of swinging entirely to an extreme of\nignoring the environmental factors that may affect democratic development ,\nwe all accept the latter viewpoint .\n\n\nHowever , there have been a wide variety of factors or preconditions\nbeing suggested , such as the economic , Social , cultural , psychological\nand external factors , only two commonly discussed preconditions will be\nselected &longdash; the political and economic ones . \n\n\n According to the democratic model , it is found that if a periodical and\nopen election system is to established , it is necessary that there is a\nwidely differentiated and articulated social structure with relatively\nautonomous social classes , regional groups , occupational groups , and\nethnic and religious groups .\n\n\nAs Huntington argues , the existence of these groups provide the\nbasis for the limitation of state power , hence for the control of the state\nby society , and hence for democratic political institutions as the most\neffective means of exercising that control . \n\n\nHowever , it is also believed that these groups must be politically\nawared and equally competed , otherwise , there may only be fragmented\noutlook or concentrated power in the face of political system .\n\n\nIf this political factor is the lacking precondition in Hong Kong ,\nit is asserted that Hong Kong lack a well-educated and autonomous social\nstructure &semi; and there is no political awareness and equally competed\ngroups .\n\n\nWhether this is the case will be further investigated . \n\n\n Furthermore , economic   wealth  is believed to be\nanother   factor  that influence the possibility of\nestablishing a democratic political system for there is one Chinese saying\ntelling that there is a sense of insult and honor only if there is no cold\nand hunger  .\n\n\nLipset also highlights the seeming correlation between high levels of\neconomic development and the prevalence of democratic political systems among\nEuropean , English-speaking and Latin American nations .\n\n\nA comparison done by the World Bank and Freedom House in 1981 showed\nthe evidence that two of thirty-six low-income countries were classified\n\" free &rdquo; or democratic , fourteen out of sixty middle-income\ncountries were so classified , and eighteen out of twenty-four countries with\nindustrial economies were so classified . \n\n\nAnd as this relationship is advocated , there are a lot of works\nevaluating whether Hong Kong is wealthy enough to promote democratic ideas ,\nespecially in this critical period .\n\n\nIf it is asserted that Hong Kong lacks democratic preconditions ,\nlacking economic conditions may be one .\n\n\nHowever , whether this analysis is valid will be called for attention\nlater . \n\n\n A last point will be reminded here serving as the footnote for this\nattempt .\n\n\nAs everyone accepts the premise that democratization requires certain\npreconditions , it is easy for one to fall into a trap for jumping from the\ncorrelation   between  democracy and other factors to\nthe conclusion that those other factors are responsible for democracy .\n\n\nMany may think that if preconditions exist , then democratization\nmust be the final outcome .\n\n\nThe attempt here will only be a work evaluating the existence of\ndemocratic preconditions but not the guessing of democratization possibility\nin Hong Kong .\n\n\nThe latter work requires a political scientist or an economist or may\nbe a fortune teller which is out of the ability here .\n\n\nFurthermore , this part of work is only meaningful by giving us a\nprobable timing on when this political system will exist .\n\n\nHowever , again , this piece of work is out of our discussion context\nhere . \n\n\n  THE EXISTENCE OF PRECONDITIONS  \n\n\n As mentioned , those preconditions usually taken by people to make an\nevaluation are both political and economic ones .\n\n\nThus , this part will mainly concern these aspects .\n\n\nAs a point of departure , it is mentioned that no one precondition\ndescribed is sufficient to lead to democratic development .\n\n\nAnd even within the political or economic factor , there may not be\nall supportive or hindering elements .\n\n\nJust like a multdimensional diamond , the relationship between the\nelements or factors are complicated .\n\n\nFurthermore , no one will blindly use the same measurement to measure\nall contexts without noticing the specific context  ' s uniqueness .\n\n\nAnd among all uniqueness , it must be known that Hong Kong has a\ncrucial political factor for her sovereignty will be returned to China in a\nflash .\n\n\nIt is absurd to underlook this factor . \n\n\n ( 1 )  Political Precondition  \n\n\n When we refer the political precondition mentioned before , it seems that\ntwo areas have to be noted .\n\n\nThey are ( a ) the existence or potential of existence\nof a group of educated , autonomous , politically awarded and equally\ncompeted bourgeoisie who can form a hierarchy of leadership providing the\nbasis for the limitation of state power or the monitor government power .\n\n\n\n ( b ) the readiness or potential of readiness of an open\npolitical system in which the most powerful decision-maker(s ) is elected or\ndismissed through the collective votings of the public &semi; and in which\nevery adult has the right to be elected . \n\n\n If it is asserted that Hong Kong lacks The preconditions for   democratization  , it is believed that Hong Kong\nis entirely lacking the above two areas .\n\n\nHowever , there are conservations .\n\n\nWhen we take a brief glance on the political scenario of Hong Kong\ngovernment slightly before , we are not difficult to have an impression that\nthe political structure of Hong Kong was dim .\n\n\nThose   elites  were mainly appointed by the\nGovernor or the Queen .\n\n\nThe deficiency of this picture was that these political actors were\ndependent on the-bureaucracy for maintaining their privileges , hence they\nmight primarily work up the initiative of the bureaucracy .\n\n\nAccordingly , the readiness of an open political system was hard to\nexist . \n\n\n On the other hand , common people were largely seen as subjects who were\nindifferent to collective decision taking as long as its results were not\ndetrimental enough to attack their interests .\n\n\nThere was an overall atmosphere of aloofness , avoidance of\ninvolvement with outsiders and low social participation .\n\n\nThey were ignorant to demand changes and participation .\n\n\nTheir means of ventilation might only be making small riots or going\nto youth centers , not to mention the awareness of political participation\nnor the formation of political parties .\n\n\nEven pressure groups were very weak and , with the exception of\nbusiness interests , largely ignored .\n\n\nThe only development towards representative government was the\nestablishment in 1982 of elected district boards which provided a forum for\nthe low-level political debate .\n\n\nIn this regard , if the assertion of Hong Kong lacking democratic\npreconditions refers to this specific time , it may be valid . \n\n\n However , the stated aloofness of people  ' s political attitude had been\naltered by three crucial factors during and after Sino-British Agreement on\n1997 issue .\n\n\nFirst , the negotiations brought home to Hong Kong people the fact\nthat their futures were being discussed by foreign governments who were\nreaching decisions on which the local population had very little say by which\nthis would result in dissatisfactions .\n\n\nAt a few moments during the negotiations there almost seemed to be\npotential for social unrest . \n\n\nThe publication of the agreement accelerated the growth of\norganizations designed   to protect  the interests\nof local people and required every citizen to take stock of his or her future .\n\n\nIn this perspective , the 1997 issue seems having dramatic effect on\npeople  ' s political consciousness . \n\n\n Second , many feared that 1997 would simply mean direct rule by the\ncommunist China which would mean authoritarian rule .\n\n\nMistrust of Chinese intentions runs deep in Hong Kong .\n\n\nApproximately 37% of the population were born in China and came to\nHong Kong as political refugees in search of better  \neconomic  opportunities . \n\n\nThis fear was especially popular among the rapid rise middle class in\nthe 1980s .\n\n\nThis propertied middle class suddenly saw its affluence and property\nthreatened by the transfer of power .\n\n\nThere emerged a constellation of occupational and functional groups\n&longdash; most or them led and supported by the middle class &longdash;\nwhich sought to improve their specific situations in the period before 1997\nfor these group leaders believed they were in a zero sum game , that if they\ndid not win support for their demands in the transitional period , then they\nwould never do so .\n\n\nMoreover , one of the new political arrangements , introduced in\nSeptember 1985 , was to provide for functional constituencies in the\nlegislature .\n\n\n( b ) This had the immediate effect of entrenching ,\nlegitimising and supplying a public forum for those functional areas and\ninterest groups fortunate enough to win representation . \n\n\n Third , the weakness of the Hong Kong government in the post-agreement\nperiod and proposed changes to the political structure , particularly the\nissue of direct elections , gave further impetus to the growth of political\nconsciousness and provided an incentive for increasing the organizational\nstrength and efficiency of pressure groups .\n\n\nFor example , Report of the Assessment Office reviewed that only 2494\nresponses were received towards the Views on the acceptability of the   agreement  and many of those were from pressure groups\nor commercial or traditional organizations who were expected to respond but\nfrom which , many respondents were opposed ones .  \n\n\n   Corresponding  to the two political areas ,\nit seems that there is increasing political awareness among people .\n\n\nAnd the rise of middle class is autonomous and well-educated enough\nto form as political leaders to limit government power and demand\nparticipation .\n\n\nOn the other hand , the picture within the political scenario is the\ndeclining governability and eroding legitimation of existing Hong Kong\ngovernment which makes the   precondition  for\nestablishing a democratic political system possible .\n\n\nIt seems that Hong Kong is not without supportive precondition .\n\n\nHowever , as mentioned , this is not as simple as a linear relations\nthat one plus one is two .\n\n\nWithin this political area there are other counter balancing factors\nthat make the picture more complex . \n\n\n Within Hong Kong context , there are internal institutional limits that\nmakes some political factors unfavourable .\n\n\nFirstly , there are not much of an established  \nhierarchy  of leadership that makes equal competition among different\ninterest groups impossible .\n\n\nSecondly , the distrust and cut-throat competition among the\npolitical elites impose great constraints in developing a\ncooperative-competitive elite culture .\n\n\nFor example , there are conflicting ideas between the appointed   elites  or the   entrepreneurs\n and the reformists .\n\n\nThirdly the representation of the functional groups are skeptical .\n\n\nFor example , is the Hong Kong workers  '  Union really working for the\ninterests of the workers ?\n\n\nFourthly , those appointed by , the bureaucracy will choose to exit\nrather than voice to respond the new environment . \n\n\n Despite this China is an influential factor affecting the political\natmosphere towards democratization for she will be the sovereign in the near\nfuture .\n\n\nProbably no one will reject the view that China is standing on a\nposition refusing radical democratization .\n\n\nReasons are three-folded .\n\n\nFirst , democratization , accompanied by group activism , mass\nvolatility and emergence of party politics , would make political control by\nChina much more difficult .\n\n\nSecond , in the view of China , the   existing\n depoliticized system of government by bureaucrats is the   corner stone  of Hong Kong  ' s economic progress , so any drastic\nchanges could unleash unpredictable forces which may be detrimental to\nstability prosperity .\n\n\nThird , China fears that the  \ndemocratization  of Hong Kong may have demonstration effect to the\nMainland China and Hong Kong may become a subversive , anticommunist base .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "3614fa7b-1e9e-4cf6-94ac-e9ea9e527205", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.056919+00:00"}
{"text": "Bill &lsquo; does not satisfy JLG accord &rsquo;  \n\n\n\n By SO LAI-FUN in Beijing  \n\n \n\nCHINA yesterday commented for the first time on the proposed\nlegislation on the Court of Final Appeal . \n\n \n\nIt said \" many aspects &rdquo; of the law did not comply\nwith the Sino-British agreement reached on the court in 1991 . \n\n \n\nGuo Fengmin , Chinese team leader of the Sino-British Joint\nLiaison Group ( JLG ) , said a brief study of the bill found\nthat it did not fully satisfy the accord reached by the JLG . \n\n \n\nAlthough he refused to disclose which part of the bill he was\nreferring to , he hinted that one discrepancy was over the nationality\nrequirement of the five judges . \n\n \n\nUnder the 1991 agreement , only one overseas judge is allowed at\neach trial .\n\n\nThe Chief Justice has to be an ethnic Chinese without a foreign\npassport . \n\n \n\nThe deal has been criticised by legislators and the legal\nprofession as curbing the flexibility guaranteed in the Basic Law . \n\n \n\nIn April , Britain submitted the draft bill on the setting up of\nthe court to China .\n\n\nThe Government hopes the court can be established by 1996 . \n\n \n\nOfficials admitted the nationality of the Chief Justice was not\nstipulated in the bill , because it was laid down in the Basic Law . \n\n \n\nMr Guo said : \" The composition was very clearly stated in\nthe joint agreement .\n\n\nIt must be carried out very strictly . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThere were other aspects China would seek to clarify with Britain\nat the JLG meeting , but dates and agenda had yet to be fixed , he said .\n\n\n \n\nThe Preliminary Working Committee ( PWC ) agreed\nyesterday that the court should be studied by the powerful Preparatory\nCommittee for the Special Administrative Region . \n\n \n\nThe PWC  ' s political affairs sub-group said the Preparatory\nCommittee should be set up in January 1996 to look into transitional matters .\n\n\n \n\nMr Guo , also a member of the sub-group , would not say whether\nthe committee would be empowered to make changes to the court if it did not\nfit China  ' s requirements .  \n\n \n\n\n  ' Legal vacuum  '  claims rejected   \n\n\n By SO LAI-FUN in Beijing  \n\n \n\nBRITAIN was claiming there would be a \" legal vacuum\n&rdquo; after 1997 in order to frighten people , a senior Chinese official\nsaid yesterday . \n\n \n\nChief negotiator of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (\nJLG ) Guo Fengmin , rejected accusations by Britain that China was\ndelaying the study of transitional legal matters in the diplomatic body .\n\n\n \n\nBritain has said that much work has been held up in the JLG\nbecause of the row over political reform , so many colonial laws will not\nhave been adapted for post-1997 Hong Kong , resulting in a legal vacuum .\n\n\n \n\nMr Guo said many laws that needed to be localised and adapted had\nbeen settled in JLG meetings . \n\n \n\n\" Why do they keep on spreading those messages about a\nlegal vacuum , which seem to be very threatening , &rdquo; Mr Guo said . \n\n \n\n\" Hong Kong will not face a legal vacuum , there is no\nquestion about that , &rdquo; he said .  \n\n \n\n\n PWC forms group on civil servants   \n\n\n By SO LAI-FUN in Beijing  \n\n \n\nCHINA  ' s working committee on Hong Kong  ' s transitional matters\nwill set up a study group on civil servants in an effort for closer ties with\nthe 180,000-strong administration . \n\n \n\nThe decision was taken in response to demands from civil service\nunions for a formal channel for communication with the Preliminary Working\nCommittee ( PWC ) , said Leung Chun-ying , local co-convener of\nthe PWC  ' s political affairs sub-group . \n\n \n\nHe said the duties of the group were \" to conduct in-depth\nstudy , collect information , listen to opinions and make reports on the\nstability of the civil services  '  system and its team &rdquo; . \n\n \n\nMainland co-convener Xiao Weiyun said Hong Kong  ' s prosperity\nhinged on the stability and continuity of the civil service . \n\n \n\nThe 15-member group , chaired by a Hong Kong member , will be\ncomposed largely of members from the territory .\n\n\nThey will report to the political sub-group . \n\n \n\nChina has accused the Government of being hostile to the PWC\nbecause of its refusal to hold formal discussion with government officials on\ntransitional matters . \n\n \n\nMr Leung said he had not discussed seeking government\nco-operation for the work of the study group . \n\n \n\n\" We very much hope to listen to civil servants  '  views ,\nbut if they do not or cannot express their opinions , that is something the\nPWC cannot change . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nSeven civil service bodies put forward the idea in PWC meetings\nheld in Hong Kong in May , he stressed . \n\n \n\nAmong the first to join the study group was Wilfred Wong Ying-wai\n, a former deputy secretary for the civil service and a political sub-group\nmember . \n\n \n\nMr Wong conceded that the group would have difficulty in inviting\nincumbent civil servants due to the Government  ' s ban on direct contact with\nthe PWC . \n\n \n\nThe necessary information could be obtained not only through\nformal meetings but through private contacts with individual members , he\nsaid . \n\n \n\nMr Wong said it was not suitable for representatives of civil\nservant bodies to be members of the group because that would create a\nconflict of interest .  \n\n \n\n\n New court proposal expected   \n\n\n By SO LAI-FUN  \n\n \n\nA NEW proposal on the Court of Final Appeal may be made by a\ngroup of barristers . \n\n \n\nThe 12-member Young Barristers  '  Committee of the Bar Council\nwill today discuss whether to put forward a motion at the Bar  ' s\nextraordinary general meeting at the end of September . \n\n \n\nMember James Cheng Chung-chin , who suggested the motion , said\nhe basically accepted the 1991 Sino-British Joint Liaison Group ( JLG\n) agreement on the court but wanted its implementation deferred for\nthree to five years . \n\n \n\nThe delay would enable local judges to gain experience so that\nsufficient judges could be recruited in Hong Kong , he said . \n\n \n\n\" It is not just a problem with the ratio of overseas\njudges and local judges , but the broader issue of whether there are\nsufficient judges on the bench .\n\n\nThe worry really lies in the quality , &rdquo; Mr Cheng said . \n\n \n\n\" It would be difficult to implement the agreement once the\ncourt is established since high-calibre judges might not be found at once .\n\n\n \n\n\" many of the judges might think of emigrating overseas\naround the time of the changeover due to uncertainty , that makes recruitment\neven more difficult . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe Judiciary should provide better conditions so as to attract\nmore senior barristers to join the bench . \n\n \n\nHe said his view was practical and moderate and was shared by\nmost members of the committee . \n\n \n\nAlthough the Bar Council had strongly opposed the restrictions ,\nthe issue would be a stalemate if they maintained their disapproval without\ngiving concrete proposals . \n\n \n\nMr Cheng foresaw strong opposition from some members of the Bar\nCouncil , but said \" there are many barristers in the association\n&rdquo; . \n\n \n\nIt is believed the bill on the Court of Final Appeal modelled on\nthe JLG agreement was submitted to the Chinese side in May .\n\n\nThe issue will be discussed by the JLG in late September . \n\n \n\nAccording to the deal , the court shall consist of five judges at\nany sitting , comprising the Chief Justice and three permanent Hong Kong\njudges , who may be local or expatriate .\n\n\nThe remaining one may , depending on the needs of the particular case\n, be drawn from a list of non-permanent Hong Kong judges or one from other\ncommon law jurisdictions . \n\n \n\nThe legal profession was vocal in objecting to the restriction on\noverseas judges .\n\n\nThey said flexibility in employing judges would be curbed , thus\ncompromising the quality of the court .  \n\n \n\n\n Rights survey planned    DISTRICT BOARD\nELECTIONS  \n\n\n By SO LAI-FUN  \n\n \n\nTHE controversial centre for former mental patients in Laguna\nCity looks likely to play a role in September  ' s district board polls . \n\n \n\nThe pressure group , Movement Against Discrimination , is to send\nquestionnaires to all election candidates this week , asking their position\non such centres and on equal opportunities legislation . \n\n \n\nThe group , composed of more than 30 organisations and\nindividuals , will announce the results and make suggestions on the choice of\ncandidates close to the September 18 polling day . \n\n \n\nSpokesman Mak Hoi-wah , a United Democrat , said the body did not\naim to attack individual candidates .\n\n\nIt simply wanted to arouse public concern and give voters some\nreference to make the right choice . \n\n \n\nHowever , he said he was concerned about the election platform of\nLiberal Party member Johnny Lui Chi-wah , who is standing in the Lai Kong\nconstituency , which includes Laguna City . \n\n \n\nMr Lui is the spokesman for a taskforce which has staked out the\nLaguna City rehabilitation centre and has used videos and cameras to take\npictures of patients since it opened in March . \n\n \n\nResidents in the task-force say they feel threatened by the home\n, the Kwun Tong Amity Centre , and wanted it moved . \n\n \n\nMr Lui has said that proposed laws outlawing discrimination\nagainst people with physical or mental disabilities deprive residents of\ntheir right to protect themselves from attacks by former mental patients .\n\n\n \n\nMr Mak said : \" We do not intend to be against any\nparticular person , but electing Mr Lui to the board certainly will not help\neliminate discrimination and will not foster equal opportunities . &rdquo;\n\n\n \n\nAnother group member , John Tse Wing-ling , said he hoped social\nworkers in the constituency estate would run against Mr Lui . \n\n \n\nMr Tse , a United Democrat who is to stand for the Wan Chai\nDistrict Board , said it was \" shameful &rdquo; that community leaders\nwere making use of residents  '  ignorance to gain popularity in elections .\n\n\n \n\n\" Discrimination demonstrated by district boards has been\nquite serious .\n\n\nRecently two district boards rejected providing facilities for\nFilipino maids , and we don't want the trend to continue . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nBut it was hard to find suitable candidates because \"\nnobody is willing to be under constant pressure and intimidation from some\nirrational residents &rdquo; . \n\n \n\nMr Lui said last night that his platform did not mention\ndiscrimination , saying the subject was abstract and difficult to define .\n\n\n \n\nEqual opportunity was too general a concept for district boards :\n\n\n\" It does not affect people  ' s livelihood . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nAlthough he supported rehabilitation facilities in \" every\ndistrict &rdquo; , he was opposed to the Government  ' s implementation of the\npolicy in his estate . \n\n \n\nHe refused to say whether he would call in his election platform\nfor the centre to be moved . \n\n \n\nHe reserved the right not to answer the questionnaires because\nthey were an attempt to smear him , he said .  \n\n \n\n\n Ants step up pressure  \n\n \n\nLIBERAL pressure group the United Ants yesterday distributed\nflyers to a Yuen Long constituency as part of its campaign against Meeting\nPoint legislator Zachary Wong Wai-yin . \n\n \n\nThe 5,000 flyers , distributed in Long Ping where Mr Wong will\nseek to extend his district board term of office , urged residents to stand\nfor the pool to widen their choice . \n\n \n\nCore member Ho Sau-lan said the group did not want voters to\nchoose only between Mr Wong and the candidate from the Democratic Alliance\nfor the Betterment of Hong Kong , Chan Siu-ching . \n\n \n\nThe group has urged Meeting Point legislators to resign because\nthey abstained in a vote on their Legco colleague Emily Lau Wai-hing  ' s bill\nseeking a fully directly elected legislature . \n\n\n-;

\n\n \n\nMr Joseph Chan Kin-key , the principal assistant to the Agency\nfor Volunteer Service  ' s director , said the hostel was still new to the\ncaged men and he hoped occupancy might rise after the Lunar New Year . \n\n \n\n\" We admit that the occupancy rate is a bit low .\n\n\nBut the hostel has opened only for two months and perhaps some caged\nmen have not heard of it, &rdquo; Mr Chan said . \n\n \n\nMr Chan said admission requirements were set by the Government\nand the agency had no right to change them on its own .\n\n\nBut he disputed that the requirements were too harsh . \n\n \n\nA government spokesman also discounted the claims . \n\n \n\n\" We believe the requirements are reasonable, &rdquo; the\nspokesman said . \n\n \n\n\" For example , the Social Welfare Department will arrange\npublic flats for those old people over 60-years-old if necessary .\n\n\nSo they need not apply for the hostel places . &rdquo;", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f9298b84-e9e4-4220-8447-9a1933cda6b3", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.058255+00:00"}
{"text": "Love Letters  \n\n \n\n&lsquo; Have you found any love letters in your locker ?\n\n\nAre there any boys staring at you in class ? &rsquo; \n\n \n\nMother kept asking me questions like that since last Tuesday ,\nwhen a Mr. Chan had phoned me at 11:30p.m while I was out with Father . \n\n \n\nHaving studied in a Girls  '  school for so many years -; from\nkindergarten through to Form Seven , I could count the number of boys I knew\nusing the fingers on one hand .\n\n\nEven after I entered a university , two hands were enough for the\ncount , and I had never received a phone-call from a boy before .\n\n\nMother said that a boy who phones you after 11:00 p.m. must be\ninfatuated with you .\n\n\nOf course I wanted to know who he was , but to make a good guess was\nnot easy because I have never known the boys well enough to know their last\nnames .\n\n\nSo , who was that Mr. Chan ? \n\n \n\nSince then , every day I came to school , I looked into the eyes\nof every male who I came across to see if there was a sign of love .\n\n\nI opened my locker twice a day to check if there was a love letter\ninside .\n\n\nBut to my disappointment , nothing unusual happened . \n\n \n\nYes , I was expecting something &lsquo; unusual &rsquo; .\n\n\nLast week when our secondary classmates were having a gathering at a\nChinese restaurant , everyone brought along their other halves -; their\nboyfriends , except me .\n\n\nI remembered my best fiend , Jane , had once told me she would never\nhave a boyfriend when studying in a university and then get married\nimmediately after graduating .\n\n\nWe two had promised each other that we wouldn't drift with the\ncurrent as we are going to be extraordinary persons ...\n\n\nBut now , how extraordinary she was -; in the arms of her\nboyfriend &semi; while I was using my two hands , grabbing the only arm I\ncould get -; the chicken wing . \n\n \n\nIt was on Monday this week , a day I would never forget , that I\nmet my O'camp group leader , John .\n\n\nI was having lunch alone . \n\n \n\n&lsquo; Hey , what happened to you , looking so pale ? &rsquo;\nsaid John . \n\n \n\n&lsquo; A cold . &rsquo;\n\n\nAs I was putting the chicken leg into my mouth , I sneezed .\n\n\nA pack of Tempo was then put in front of me . \n\n \n\n&lsquo; By the way , I phoned you last week but you were not at\nhome .\n\n\nI just wanted to invite you to join the service on Saturday . &rsquo;\n\n\n \n\nOh , he was that Chan !\n\n\nIt might be ridiculous but , with the Tempo he gave to me , my cold\nwas cured immediately . \n\n \n\nThe next day when I came to school , I met him .\n\n\nAnd the day after , I met him twice .\n\n\nWithin four days , we met for six times on campus .\n\n\nWas that a kind of coincidence or ...\n\n\nThough every time we only had the time to say &lsquo; Hi &rsquo; , I\ncouldn't help but think of that Hi-C advertisement -; &lsquo; Like\nsunshine , you light up my life ... &rsquo; \n\n \n\nAnd on Thursday , I received an e-mail from Chan .\n\n\nI finally learned his given names -; Chi-heung was displayed on\nthe screen .\n\n\nIn Chinese , it means ambitious , I supposed . \n\n \n\n&lsquo; Are you free tomorrow ?\n\n\nI  ' d like to invite you to join my birthday party ( ha , just\nkidding ) .\n\n\nHow about going to see a movie in the non-print section of the\nlibrary at 2:30 p.m. tomorrow ?\n\n\nReply today . &rsquo; \n\n \n\nIt would be my first date !\n\n\nI was so eager to go , but being a girl I should be more restrained ,\nas mother always said .\n\n\nSo I hid my happiness and just replied , &lsquo; see you at 2:30p.m.\ntomorrow , at the non-print section . &rsquo;\n\n\nAfter school that day , I saw him again and I gave him a special\nsmile . \n\n \n\nI couldn't sleep well that night .\n\n\nAll the time I rehearsed the scene of the next day in my mind .\n\n\nI ironed the only dress I had , which was bought for the graduation\nparty when I was in Form Five .\n\n\nI stole some cosmetics from Mom too , though I didn't use them\nbecause I couldn't figure out which things were for what purposes . \n\n \n\nOn Friday , at exactly 2:30p.m. , I reached the non-print section .\n\n\nHe had not come yet and while I was waiting , I counted my heartbeats\n, as my heart was thumping so loud that even those standing next to me could\nhear it . \n\n \n\n&lsquo; Hey , Laura , you are so early . &rsquo; \n\n \n\nWas that my Chi-heung ?\n\n\nNo , it was a she , Judy , my classmate .\n\n\nShe continued , &lsquo; so , let  ' s see the movie together . &rsquo;\n\n\n \n\nOf course I won't let her spoil my first date . \n\n \n\n&lsquo; Sorry Judy , but I am expecting someone . &rsquo; \n\n \n\n&lsquo; But you have promised me in the mail . &rsquo; \n\n \n\n&lsquo; You mean e-mail ?

{"text": "Advances in the Consumer Electronics Industry  \n\n \n\nJust like a computer , the latest consumer ICs can be made to\nperform different functions by altering the software in them .\n\n\nIn order to cater for different application areas , a wide range of\nconsumer ICs are developed based on a common computer core .\n\n\nThis article will give a concise description on these ICs as well as\nsome practical applications . \n\n\n By Danny Leung , Techno Mind Ltd . \n\n \n\nThe advancement of semiconductor technology has brought about many\npowerful yet low cost Integrated Circuits ( ICs ) for the\nconsumer industry .\n\n\nThe latest consumer ICs have in them a processor which can be\nprogrammed to perform extremely intelligent tasks - a processor with at least\nfour times the computing power of the APPLE II computer which once dominated\nthe Personal Computer ( PC ) world . \n\n \n\nWith the IC fabrication technology going sub-micron ( i.e.\nthe minimum separation between two design features in the IC is less than one\nmillionth of a meter ) , the physical size of an IC is extremely small .\n\n\nSince the cost of an IC is directly proportional to its size , the\ncost of today  ' s consumer ICs is only a tiny portion of its cost ten years\nago .\n\n\nAs a result , applications that once were too expensive to implement\nare now possible and affordable .\n\n\nMost of the ICs described in this article range in price from\nUS&dollar;0.30 to US&dollar;2.00 .\n\n\nAs consumer ICs become more powerful yet less expensive , they will\nincreasingly affect our daily lives as well as the various industries which\nuse them in products  .  \n\n\n  Advanced Consumer ICs  \n\n \n\nConsumer ICs in this article are defined as those used for such\nproducts like toys , greeting cards , electronic games and accessories etc .\n\n\nShould they fail , they will - in most cases - not cause serious\nbodily harm or have serious consequences .\n\n\nAs the cost of consumer ICs come down quite rapidly , more and more\nproducts will incorporate them . \n\n \n\nSince the number of consumer ICs in existence are huge , this\narticle will only describe the most advanced few which are most likely to\ncause a revolution in the consumer electronic industry . \n\n\n  LCD Processors  \n\n \n\nLCD processors are a range of programmable ICs with Liquid\nCrystal Displays ( LCD ) .\n\n\nThe block diagram of a typical LCD processor is shown in Figure 1 .\n \n\n \n\nAs shown in the diagram , an LCD processor is in fact a\nself-contained computer .\n\n\nLike a computer , the LCD processor can perform different functions\nby executing different software , which is usually written for a particular\napplication or game and , unlike the software for an ordinary computer , is\nburned permanently into the LCD processor ROM during IC fabrication process .\n\n\nOnce the IC is fabricated , the software cannot be changed . \n\n \n\nThe largest single chip LCD processor currently in the market has\na 1024-dot monochrome LCD driver with 192K byte of memory which can be used\nto store speech or graphics data .\n\n\nLarger LCD screens will require multiple ICs to implement .\n\n\nAlthough color LCD has already been available for the high-end market\nfor a while , low-cost color LCD processsors have just reached the low-end\nmarket .\n\n\nThe current color LCD processor has a 540-dot 8-color LCD driver and\n32K byte of memory . \n\n \n\nWith the huge success of Tamagotchi-type ( virtual pet\n) games and Electronic Fishing games in 1997 , LCD processors have\nfound their ways into the consumer market in a very big way .\n\n\nThis trend is likely to continue as LCD processors become more\npowerful and colorful . \n\n\n  Voice Processors  \n\n \n\nVoice processors are a range of programmable ICs with\nspeech/voice/melody synthesizers .\n\n\nThe block diagram of a typical voice processor is show in Figure 2 .\n \n\n \n\nThe biggest single chip voice processor contains 16Mbits of\nmemory which can be used to store voice or other data .\n\n\nTwo audio outputs are provided to achieve a stereo effect .\n\n\nWith one of these speech processors , 600 seconds of speech data can\nbe stored on chip . \n\n \n\nFor applications requiring minutes of speech , a speech\ndecompression IC is necessary in addition to a voice processor .\n\n\nThe speech decompression IC will extend the speech duration of a\nvoice processor by 4 to 7 times .\n\n\nThe block diagram of this two chip configuration is shown in figure 3 .\n \n\n \n\nIn this approach , the speech to be stored on the voice processor\nis first captured and then processed by a computer .\n\n\nThe computer will turn the speech data into a much compressed format\nby a technology known as Code-book Excited Linear Predictive coding (\nCELP ) .\n\n\nIn fact , this technology has been used in our digital telephone\nanswering machine in which human speech from a telephone line is turned into\ncompressed data format before being stored to memory .\n\n\nSince this operation must be performed in real-time without the\nassistance of a computer in an answering machine , more powerful , hence more\nexpensive , Digital Signal Processor ( DSP ) chips are required\nin an answering machine . \n\n \n\nApplications with large speech content , like talking story books\n, have always been confined to the computer world .\n\n\nWith the emerging low-cost speech processors and decompression ICs ,\nstand  -  alone story books which talk for one hour or more are\nbecoming a reality . \n\n\n  Music Processors  \n\n \n\nMusic Processors are a series of programmable ICs which can be\nprogrammed to generate music in 4 or 8 channel formats .\n\n\nIn other words , 4 to 8 musical notes can be output at the same time .\n\n\nIn addition , different instruments or voices can be used for each\nnote resulting in rich harmonies .\n\n\nThe block diagram of a typical processor is shown in figure 4 . \n\n\n \n\nAs shown in the diagram above , a music processor also provides\ntwo audio outputs for creating music in stereo .\n\n\nAn external memory interface is also available for cartridge\napplications in which music can be played for hours by changing cartridges .\n\n\nMusic processors have made much ground on improving the \"\nelectronic feeling &rdquo; of earlier melody ICs .\n\n\nThese ICs are likely to create a musical revolution in the consumer\nindustry . \n\n\n  Voice Recognition Processors  \n\n \n\nVoice recognition processors are a group of ICs which can be\nprogrammed to recognize the human voice .\n\n\nCurrent voice recognition technology is known as isolated word voice\nrecognition and it can only recognize human voice in a word-by-word basis .\n\n\nAlthough intensive research is being carried out in continuous speech\nrecognition , low-cost ICs for continuous speech recognition will not be\navailable for some time .\n\n\nThe block diagram of a typical voice recognition processor is shown\nin figure 5 . \n\n \n\nThere are two recognition methods available in a voice\nrecognition processor: speaker dependent voice recognition and speaker\nindependent voice recognition .\n\n\nFor the speaker dependent voice recognition , the words to be\nrecognized must first be trained into the IC by speaking to the microphone a\nfew times , the words to be recognized in the training mode .\n\n\nRecognition data is generated and stored during this training process .\n\n\nOnce all words have been trained , the IC is switched back to the\nnormal recognition mode .  \n\n \n\nIn this recognition mode , any spoken word will be compared to\nthe words which have just been trained and appropriate action will be carried\nout if a spoken word is recognized .\n\n\nThe accuracy of speaker dependent recognition can be as high as\n99% and the recognition vocabulary is infinite as any word can be\ntrained easily .\n\n\nHowever , the recognition will only work for the trainer and will not\nwork accurately for other users . \n\n \n\nSpeaker independent voice recognition , on the other hand , will\nnot require training and recognition should work for everybody .\n\n\nAll words to be recognized must first be processed using a computer .\n\n\nFor each word , 500 samples are required to be recorded from the\ntarget group .\n\n\nThese sound samples are then analyzed by the computer and recognition\ndata is generated and stored on a voice recognition processor .\n\n\nFrom this point on , the operator is exactly like the same as speaker\ndependent recognition described above . \n\n \n\nThe recognition data generation process in speaker independent\nrecognition is lengthy and the accuracy is totally depends on how good this\nprocess is handled.\n\n\nIn general , accuracy of speaker independent recognition is less than\nthat of speaker dependent recognition .\n\n\nWith good recognition data , the accuracy of speaker independent\nrecognition can be as high as 96% . \n\n \n\nReliable voice recognition processors are beginning to appear in\nthe consumer industry .\n\n\nThis happens because the IC/software technology has matured over the\nyears to a point where complicated voice recognition algorithms are now\npossible and affordable .\n\n\nOnce the ground is broken , we can expect to see more and more voice\ncontrolled products which will really listen to you . \n\n\n  Record/Playback Processors  \n\n \n\nRecord/playback processors are a family of programmable ICs with\nrecord and playback functions .\n\n\nThe block diagram of a typical record/playback processor is shown in\nFigure 6 . \n\n \n\nWith a record/playback processor , a message can be recorded and\nplayed back with

into a\nsong or game . \n\n \n\nIn addition , by taking advantage of the in-built Analog to\nDigital Converter ( ADC ) , many types of sensors like\ntemperature , pressure , position , etc . can be

more IC design houses will be set up there to take a cut of the\nbusiness .\n\n\nMost of these design houses are so-called  ' fabless ' which means they\ndo not possess IC fabrication facilities .\n\n\nThey rely on open IC foundries such as TSMC ( Taiwan\nSemiconductor Manufacturing Corporation ) , UMC ( United\nMicroelectronics Corporation ) , Win  -  bond , et al. , to\nmanufacture ICs for them . \n\n \n\nAs the computer memory business has been going into uncertain\ncycles in recent years , well-established IC companies in Taiwan are also\nlooking at the consumer electronic industry for more business .\n\n\nAs competition between companies in Taiwan is getting intense , it is\nalready evident that a price war is starting to benefit end-consumers .\n\n\nIn order to survive in this competitive environment , companies will\nhave to be creative and resourceful .\n\n\nWhat all this means is we definitely will see more powerful and less\nexpensive ICs than we see today .

Safety Design of Buildings in\nHong Kong   \n\n\n Sui Ming LO PhD , FHKIS , Authorized Person   \n\n\n Introduction  \n\n \n\nThe spatial design of a building can be influenced by the fire\nsafety codes .\n\n\nAs buildings develop and become more complex and new materials are\nused , the prescriptive fire safety rules may not provide an efficient\nsolution to the new building design .\n\n\nA system approach to the design of fire safety in buildings on the\nbasis of performance criteria may be necessary. \n\n \n\nIn theory , the Hong Kong practice permits alternative\napproaches to the building codes so long as equivalent safety standard can be\ndemonstrated .\n\n\nThe recently published fire codes in Hong Kong have recognised the\nfire safety engineering approach which may be regarded as a system approach\nto the problem. \n\n \n\nThis paper provides a brief discussion on fire safety\nengineering design.  \n\n\n Fire Safety Engineering Design  \n\n \n\nThe main purpose of fire safety engineering design is to provide\na framework to demonstrate that the performance requirements of legislation\nare met ( or better ) , even though the design solutions\nadopted fall outside the prescriptive recommendations .\n\n\nIt takes into account the total fire safety package to provide a\nmore fundamental and economic solution than traditional approaches .\n\n\nIn other words , it may offer a flexible alternative especially when\ndesigning for difficult buildings.  \n\n \n\nFor most buildings , prescriptive recommendations in the fire\ncodes may be used for the design .\n\n\nWhereas , for unusual buildings , fire-safety engineering approach\nmay enable rational design .\n\n\nSome designers may have the opinion that fire safety engineering\ndesign will merely be adopted for large and complex buildings .\n\n\nHowever , the fire codes do not explicitly restrict the use of such\ndesign to large and complex building .\n\n\nIndeed , alteration and addition works in some old buildings may be\ndifficult in compliance with the new prescriptive requirements .\n\n\nA total fire engineering approach may be the only solution .\n\n\nFigure I illustrates the approaches.   \n\n\n The general framework  \n\n \n\nFire safety engineering design can be applied in considering one\naspect of the design ( i.e .\n\n\nin considering one element in a building ) or providing a\ncomplete fire safety strategy of a whole building. \n\n \n\nIn the building design where one or a few elements have minor\nnon-compliance , the use of like-to-like substitutions ( equivalence\n) which can be demonstrated by a fire engineering study may be\nadequate .\n\n\nFor major difference with the prescriptive requirements , risk\nassessment may need to be carried out in order to demonstrate that the system\nperformance is within an acceptable level. \n\n \n\nFire safety engineering design involves fire , people and\nbuilding interacting studies .\n\n\nIt is complex and a single set of procedures and calculating tools\ncan hardly be established for applying to all buildings.  \n\n\n The analysis  \n\n \n\nThe major steps are to identify the problems in the design and\nanalyse the suitability of an alternative design .\n\n\nThe architectural layout of the proposed design is reviewed and the\nnon-compliance items are identified .\n\n\n( i.e. Why the design cannot fully comply with the\nprescriptive requirements? )\n\n\nAn alterative design in order to \" substitute &rdquo; the\nnon-compliance part is proposed and a method in evaluating the suitability is\nformulated .\n\n\nThe evaluation involves demonstration of equivalence or acceptable\nrisk level .\n\n\nEquivalence is considered as equal performance between the designed\nsystem and what is expected under full compliance with the prescriptive\nrequirements .\n\n\nAn evaluation of the proposed design especially by means of\nanalytical approach should form the basis of the judgement. \n\n \n\nFor simple design , a qualitative judgement evaluated by experts\nmay be adopted .\n\n\nWhereas , for other cases , quantitative  evaluation by computational tools may need to be used for\nassisting the judgement. \n\n \n\nQuantitative evaluation can be established on the basis of three\ntypes of approaches , namely deterministic , comparative and probabilistic.\n\n\n \n\nIn deterministic approach , models are used to formulate the\nfire , building and people interacting phenomenon .\n\n\nSuch models are deterministic and based on physical , chemical and\nthermodynamic relationships derived from scientific theories and empirical\ncorelationships .\n\n\nThe basic objective is to show that all occupants can leave a\nthreatened part of a building without being subjected to untenable\nconditions. \n\n \n\nComparative approach is to demonstrate that the alternative\ndesign provides a level of safety equivalent to that in a building that\ncomplies with the prescriptive codes. \n\n \n\nProbabilistic approach is to assign probabilities of failure to\nfire protection measures and frequencies of occurrence to unwanted evens and\nto demonstrate that the likelihood of a given event occurrence is within\nacceptable limit.  \n\n\n The Computational Tools  \n\n \n\nComputer models can be used to perform the computation .\n\n\nRecently , numerous computer programmes have been developed for\nmodelling different aspects in the fire scenarios .\n\n\nIn general , the models include fire models and people/ fire\ninteraction models.  \n\n \n\nThe fire models are , in general , classified further into zone\nand field models .\n\n\nThe zone models are formulated by dividing the compartments into\nparts and by the consideration of the conservation equations for mass ,\nmomentum and enthalpy ( ref . 1 ) .\n\n\nThese models such as ASET ( Ref . 2 ) , CFAST (\nref . 3 ) , ARGOS ( Ref . 4 ) aim at giving a\ndescription of the macroscopic picture of fires .\n\n\nIt is , therefore , useful for simulation of fires involving\nmultiples compartments such as shopping malls , high-rise commercial and\nresidential buildings. \n\n \n\nThe field models , on the other hand , consist of the detailed\nconsiderations of mass , momentum and energy conservation where the field\nquantities such as temperature , density , species concentration and velocity\n, etc .\n\n\ncan be determined .\n\n\nThey are found useful in giving a microscopic representation and\ndescription for fires which are often necessary for the understanding of the\nbehaviour of components in buildings and their interactions in fire\nsituations .\n\n\nIt is , however , well-known that the numerical simulations using\nfield modelling techniques require extensive computational efforts and\nresources .\n\n\nTheir applications are , thus , limited to the prediction of fires\nin single compartments or elements .\n\n\nWith the recent advancement of the computers , the possibility of\nusing field models may be extended .\n\n\nFor example , three-dimensional fire models such as CONE3D and\nFIRE3D ( Ref . 5 , 6 ) which incorporates the complex\ninteractions between solid fuel pyrolysis ( i.e . thermal degradation\n) , gaseous combustion reactions , turbulent gas flow and radiation\nheat transfer due to flame have recently been developed and can be solved\nnumerically to predict ignition and the development of fire due to the\nburning of some solid fuels. \n\n \n\nThe people and fire interaction models aim at simulating the\nreaction of the people under fire situations in order to develop the\nlife-to-risk level of the occupants .\n\n\nThese models are based on egress models such as EVACNET+ (\nRef . 7] , EXITT ( Ref . 8 ) , EXIT89 ( Ref. 9 )\n, WAYOUT ( Ref . 10 ) , SIMULEX ( Ref . 11 ) etc.\n\n\n \n\nAlthough there are many computational tools developed , it is\nworth noting that all the computer models are developed on the basis of\nvarious assumptions and limitations .\n\n\nCareful judgement should be needed for using these tools.   \n\n\n Concluding Remarks  \n\n \n\nIn Hong Kong , the complexity of buildings is increasing .\n\n\nThe Government has explicitly recognised the fire safety engineering\napproach .\n\n\nThe demand for such approach in building design is obviously\nincreasing .\n\n\nHowever , verification of the design by fire safety engineering\napproach requires specialist knowledge. \n\n \n\nIn practice , consideration should also be given to ascertain\nthe appropriate person who can carry out or certify the design works .\n\n\nAn Authorized Person who is responsible for certifying all building\nworks to be in compliance with the Building Regulations may not necessarily\nhave the training for carrying out or examining the fire safety design .\n\n\nShould another registered person such as a fire engineer be required\nto certify the adequacy of the fire safety design ?\n\n\nShould it be reasonable to require the Authorized Person to certify\nthe engineering design ?\n\n\nFurther consideration in this issue may also be necessary. \n\n \n\n( A practical example in demonstrating the fire\nengineering approach will be given in a subsequent article. )", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "13f94130-ed20-4390-a1df-71e9749f81db", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.060972+00:00"}
{"text": "Liberty or freedom has been highly valued in human history while its\nmeaning has heated up much debates .\n\n\nVarious delineations can be found whereas Isaiah Berlin has identified\ntwo prevailing families of conceptions of liberty accepted by many as the two\nmost central ones .\n\n\nThey are the \" negative sense &rdquo; which sees freedom as\nindividual independence from others and the positive sense \" that\nidentifies freedom with a sense of self-realisation .\n\n\nHowever , this essay will focus only on the former one which has\ncanvassed extensively in liberal and modern society , drawing upon Charles\nTaylor  ' s critique to it in the positive stand . \n\n\n Taylor rejects the idea of freedom as mere absence of external obstacles .\n\n\nMen are purposive beings who strive for realising oneself , in a way\nconsciously or unconsciously , discriminating among motivations and desires\nso as to identify what is really good to oneself .\n\n\nIt is improbable that such a process outrules all internal accounts .\n\n\nMore decisively , in experimentating what is right or wrong to do ,\nman can be fallible .\n\n\nTaylor thus objects also to reserve the final authority with regard to\nassessing an authentic life to the subject only .\n\n\nSuch a line of thinking , Taylor asserts , is indefensible . \n\n\n Before further substantiating   Taylor  ' s \ncritique , a brief recapitulation of the central themes of negative liberty\ndeems necessary .\n\n\nHitherto in the realm of negative liberty , one can hardly find a\nperspective in unanimity , meaning that upon certain ideas in   consensus  , views are diversified arising from different\ntheorists .\n\n\nOn one side of the continuum , there is a crude Hobbesian concept\nwhere  \" being free is a matter of what we can do , of what it\nis open to us to do , whether or not we do anything to exercise these options .\n&rdquo;   \n\n\n Taylor named it as  \" crude &rdquo;  in the sense\nthat it manifests - somehow &lsquo; the most extreme and original concept of\nnegative liberty .\n\n\nThat an   absence  of external physical or\nlegal obstacles is a sufficient condition of freedom .\n\n\nSuch a pure opportunity concept demands only a provision without any\nman-made   interference  .\n\n\nIt has nothing to do with our inabilities or internal attributes ,\nsay when we wish to fly but cannot , when we wish to travel round the world\nbut have no money , when we highly value a diligent life but lack motivation .\n\n\nIn such circumstances , we cannot be said to be \" unfree\n&rdquo; . \n\n\n On the other side , there are theorists such as J. S. Mill who\nincorporate some notion of self-realisation , self-fulfillment to freedom ,\nthat something can fail on account of inner reasons besides external barriers\nor on both .\n\n\nFor instance , my fear of getting hurt have stopped me from learning\nto ride bicycle even though I long to do so , Or I know that sleeping too\nmuch is not good for me but just could not resist that comfort   of idling  .\n\n\nObviously , some internal barriers need to be overcome and some\ndegree of exercise is crucial for a men to be thought free .\n\n\nAbove all , such a modern notion still identifies freedom as a matter\nof being able to do something or other , of not having internal or external\nobstacles in one  ' s way , rather than to ascribe man  ' s capacity to realise\nas an important asset to freedom . \n\n\n There are reasons of course , for the family of negative liberty to\ndefine freedom so tough-mindedly .\n\n\nFirst , it enjoys an elegant simplicity as it requires only knowledge\nof personal desires .\n\n\nSecond , the dominance of positivist thinking and natural science\norientation has been discriminating against things that appear too\nmetaphysical .\n\n\nTo talk of self-realisation or actualising freedom is something out\nof the realm of human rationality .\n\n\nIt seems unwise to let oneself indulge into such thinking . \n\n\n Third and the most significant point is the fear of Totalitarian Menace ,\nthe fear of being coerced or manipulated in the name of freedom .\n\n\nThe negative theorists are therefore driven into alliance under the\nshield of crude view .\n\n\nIt is endangering to have one  ' s mentality to be assessed or\nsecond-guessed by someone else , to have people coming around telling you\nthat you have identified wrongly with your authentic self , that you should\nhave inclined to something else .\n\n\nHistorical episodes such as Cultural Revolution , ideas promoting\ncollective consciousness have threatened no matter the crude defense or the\nmodern notion to hold firmly as ever to individual independence that \n\" each person  ' s form of self realisation is original to him or her and\ncan therefore only be worked out independently . &rdquo;   \n\n\n Nonetheless , such a Maginot Line mentality has put off many other\nvaluable intuitions of human agency .\n\n\nIn the first place , its oversimplified version of freedom has thrown\nmen into an arena of wants and desires only .\n\n\nYet , human beings have more to do with desires for food , for\ncomfort , for security and so on .\n\n\nRather , man can desire over desires , that he has the ability to\ndifferentiate and evaluate upon his desires .\n\n\nIn a way , mere identification of wants and desires   guarantees  no freedom , not to mention the probable case of\nfalse appreciation .\n\n\nTo Taylor , freedom can be augmented through strong evaluation and\ndiscrimination among motivations , mind that he does not assert that\nfulfilling the latters will   automatically \nmake one free . \n\n\n The case is upon strong evaluation concerning with the qualitative worth\nof different desires , we find that capacities relevant to freedom involve\nentities such as self understanding , self control and moral discrimination .\n\n\nIn other words , since we can fail to discriminate , since we may\nlose self control like the people addicted to drug or over-eating , it is\nmore likely that we are unfree rather than free if we remain in the shallow\nconception of man .\n\n\nIt follows that  \" one is free only to the extent that\none has effectively determined oneself and the shape of one  ' s life . &rdquo;\n  The concept of freedom here is an\nexercise concept . \n\n\n In the second place , the overt allegiance against the mentioning on ends\nor discriminations among motivations faces strong rebuttals .\n\n\nFor a point , refusal to mention does not imply its   non-existence  .\n\n\nFor another point , it is unconvincing that the negative view is\nreally free from all kinds of discrimination in a moral sense .\n\n\nTaylor has given an example as to putting up a new traffic light at\nan intersection close to one  ' s home against a law forbidding one from\nworshipping .\n\n\nFor the former , it is unlikely that one will interpret it as a\njeopardy to freedom .\n\n\nPerhaps , it induces some inconvenience , but it is far from\nintruding into one  ' s personal life .\n\n\nFor the latter , however , one will probably regard it as a threat to\npersonal liberty . \n\n\n Why is this so ? In essence , a background of significance has been\nnaturally expelled out that certain goals and activities are more significant\nthan others .\n\n\nIn fact , when the advocates for negative liberty agree that liberty\nof some must depend on the restraint on others and assume that the area of\nmen  ' s free action must be limited by law , they  \nunanimously  support that some portion of human existence must remain\nindependent of the sphere of social control when asked when the boundary\nshould lie .\n\n\nFor instance , Benjamin Constance had declared that  \"\nat the very least the liberty of religion , opinion , expression , property ,\nmust be   guaranteed  against arbitrary invasion .\n&rdquo;   \n\n\n Theorists of negative liberty just cannot escape from entrenching in\ndiscriminations between obstacles as   representing\n more or less infringement of freedom .\n\n\nThe agenda just cannot hide itself .\n\n\nMoreover , such a discrimination is necessary qualitative in the\nsense that comparison in terms of number of acts restricted is refutable .\n\n\nTaking again the restriction towards the way one crosses the road and\nworships as example , the detrimental effects of a single law prohibiting\nreligious activity are far overwhelming then say , hundreds of traffic lights\nerected . \n\n\n It follows that we are ongoingly performing qualitative discriminations\namong motivations as each of us bears a significance of purposes .\n\n\nIn essence , it is what makes us distinguishable from other species\nbeings that we have the capacity to reflect and to evaluate .\n\n\nFurthermore , it is only when we employ strong evaluation , that we\ncould realise ,  \" the purposes we know to be more significant\nare not always those which we desire with the greatest urgency to encompass ,\nnor the ones that actually always win out in cases of conflict of desire .\n&rdquo;   \n\n\n In other words , significance does not imply wanting more .\n\n\nFor instance , I feel that searching a mission in my life is\nsignificant to me , yet I may be much more strongly attached to my desires as\nto sleep more , to enjoy more and so on .\n\n\nThe strive for material or physiological desires may refrain me from\ndoing things which I think is good .\n\n\nThus , the fact that I am doing what I want , in the sense of\nfollowing the strongest desire is not sufficient to establish that I am free .\n\n\nOn the contrary , identification with the strongest desire may   possibly  lead to unfreedom rather than freedom . \n\n\n Having said so much on the need for strong evaluation , for qualitative\nreflection and asserted certain necessary internal , motivational conditions\nfor freedom , a question emerges as who or how to decide \" What is\nauthentic ? &rdquo; to oneself .\n\n\nWhen it cannot be guided by desires alone , what is the alternative ?\nHow can it be articulated ? \n\n\n For   theorists  of negative liberty , they may\nso far concede that freedom cannot merely be the absence of external\nobstacles , but the absence of external obstacles to significant action , and\nthat freedom may or may not rely on an opportunity concept upon which\nopportunities are unequal .\n\n\nHowever , they insist firmly that only the subject himself has the\nright to perform the final arbitration .\n\n\nNo valid guidance can be provided in principle by outside authority\nbecause of human diversity and originality .\n\n\nIn brief , no one is allowed for second-guessing . \n\n\n Nevertheless , such an individualistic view sounds only if one  ' s\nperception of desires is absolutely right .\n\n\nCan the case be so ? It is so if only our feelings are brute , such\nas the imperceptible raw feel like the pain in bleeding and the thirst for\nwater .\n\n\nBut many of our feelings and   desires  are\nnot brute .\n\n\nThey are import attributing in a sense that they are to the least\ninnoculated with our experiences and judgement .\n\n\nThus , we can be in error in feeling , say , anger .\n\n\nFor instance , a friend persuading me out for dinner when I am nearly\nburnt out in work may infuriate me as not considerate enough , but on\narriving to a birthday party awaiting for me may make me laugh only at my own\nnarrow-mind . \n\n\n In many more cases , we have experienced mistakenly , we have perceived\nwrongly .\n\n\nSomehow , our feelings involve how we experience the situation and\nhow we interpret our experience .\n\n\nIn such a way , can anyone guarantee that he or she can never be in\nerror , unless there is nothing to be right or wrong ? Probably no one can .\n\n\nBut if there is no right or wrong , how can one explain when people\ndo repudiate some desires and safeguard others ? How can one explain that\nthere are desires when we abandon we lose nothing ? Thus the subject himself\ncannot be the only final authority on the question whether he is free ,\nwhether his desires are authentic . \n\n\n And wrong perceptions can be internal barriers to keep us away from\nfreedom .\n\n\nWe may fail to detect them and thus fail in self-realisation .\n\n\nThus , second-guessing by others is justifiable as a way to assist\nrather than to hinder our search for freedom .\n\n\nSecond-guessing is not a kind of coercion as perceived by negative\nliberty .\n\n\nIt is done through dialogue and strong evaluation .\n\n\nThere are opinions by others   worth noting\n .\n\n\nThere are advices by others worth listening .\n\n\nThere are sharing of experiences by others worth attending to .\n\n\nCommunication and understanding among people is an aid to growth and\nclairvoyance . \n\n\n Furthermore , once we admit that our feelings are import-attributing ,\nthen we admit that there is no objective understanding exists .\n\n\nThere is no absolute truth or correct interpretation indeed .\n\n\nAn articulation can be wrong .\n\n\nReality can be distorted .\n\n\nWe should well aware of our limitation in experience and our\nperception as frequently impartial and uncertain .\n\n\nIt is only when we open ourselves to risking and testing our\nperceptions and judgements through dialogical encounter and deep reflective\nevaluation , that we may get closer to the truth . \n\n\n In a way , interpretation upon interpretation is necessary in a sense\nthat our deep evaluations are never complete .\n\n\nThere is   always  room for challenge ,\nre-evaluation and re-consideration .\n\n\nHuman world is such an indeterminate zone but we are not to retrieve\nfrom searching the truth .\n\n\nMoment by moment , we should still stand in the best of one  ' s\nability to provide good reasons for judgement with an open mind . \n\n\n FOOTNOTES  \n\n\n(1) P. 213 Taylor C.\n\n\n\" What  ' s wrong with negative liberty ? &rdquo; \n\n\n\n(2) P. 212 Ibid  \n\n\n(3) P. 213 Ibid  \n\n\n(4) P. 19 Berlin I.\n\n\n\" Two concepts of liberty &rdquo;  \n\n\n(5) P. 220 Taylor C.\n\n\n\" What  ' s wrong with negative liberty ? &rdquo; \n\n\n REFERENCES \n\n\nBerlin Isaiah (1984)\n\n\n\" Two concepts of liberty &rdquo; in Michael Sandel ed. ,\n\n\n Liberalism and its Critics  .\n\n\nOxford : Basil Blackwell\n\n\nP. 15-36\n\n\nGibbons  Michel  T.\n\n\n(l987)\n\n\n\" Interpretation , Genealogy and Human Agency &rsquo; .\n\n\nin Terence  Ball   ed.  ,\n\n\n Idioms of   Inquiry  : Critique and\nRenewal in Political Science \n\n\nAlbany : State University of New York Press\n\n\nP. 137-146\n\n\nTaylor Charles (1985)\n\n\n\" What  ' s wrong with negative liberty ? &rdquo; in \nPhilosophy and the Human Sciences : Philosophical Papers 2 \n\n\nCambridge : Cambridge University Press\n\n\nP. 211-229\n\n\nTaylor Charles (1985)\n\n\n\" What is human agency ? &rdquo; in  Human Agency and   Language  : Philosophical Papers 2 \n\n\nCambridge : Cambridge University Press\n\n\nP. 15-44", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "87acc361-e95b-429d-b399-00538cc15892", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.062668+00:00"}

Ko asks .\n\n\n\" There is really no conflict between art and money .\n\n\nI am there to produce a show with artistic acclaim .\n\n\nI am also there to produce a box office success . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nIn a fickle town like Hong Kong , having both worlds isn't easy .\n\n\nAccording to Ko , part of Springtime  ' s success has to do with\nknowing where to focus .\n\n\n\" We focus strictly on the audiences and deliver what they want .\n\n\nIt doesn't matter if you make a great  ' artistic ' play if only 10\npeople come to see it , &rdquo; he says . \n\n \n\nIt  ' s not that Ko hasn't tried .\n\n\nIn 1998 , Springtime produced a play called  Love Paradox  ,\nbased on a famous Chinese opera,  The Lovers  .\n\n\nIt told the bitter-sweet tale of a pair of ill-fated young lovers who\nwere victims of strict archaic Chinese values .\n\n\nKo put in a twist , giving the play some homosexual overtones .\n\n\n\" I thought I doing something artistic and many theatre critics\nexpressed great interest in the play , &rdquo; Ko says .\n\n\nBut the play turned out to be a flop and Springtime lost &dollar;2\nmillion dollars .\n\n\n\" It failed because no one wanted to pay money to see the play\n, so it doesn't matter when we say something is artistic or commercial , if\nit doesn't survive the box office , it doesn't exist . \n\n \n\n\" The so-called high art only exists in proposals , &rdquo;\nhe says . \n\n \n\nKo credits his company partner , To , for keeping the audiences\nhappy .\n\n\n\" Raymond is the perfect combination of artistic and commercial sense\n, &rdquo; Ko says .\n\n\n\" He can lead the audience without losing them , gives them\nsomething refreshing to see without making our shows too out of reach .\n&rdquo; \n\n \n\nHence his strong objection to subsidised theatres . \n\n \n\n\" In the long run it just won't work , it  ' s welfare for\nthe artists , &rdquo; Ko says .\n\n\n\" Some of these so called  ' independent ' or  ' avant-garde'\ntheatre groups are merely using tax dollars to fulfil themselves , they don't\nhave to worry about cost because it  ' s the Government  ' s money .\n\n\nThey have no responsibility to the audience . &rdquo;\n\n\nOthers beg to differ .\n\n\nRenowned playwright Ko Tin-lung , who helped Clifton Ko produce the\nmusical  I Have A Date With Spring  that helped kick-start\nSpringtime  ' s success , claims subsidised theatre is the core of theatrical\ndevelopment . \n\n \n\nCommercial theatre companies are not going to experiments with\nnew ideas or plays because it is too risky , &rdquo; he says .\n\n\n\" Subsidised theatre opens up new ground .\n\n\nIt doesn't mean we don't have a responsibility to our audiences , we\nalso want people to see our plays . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nKo Tin-lung has decided to join Chung Ying Theatre Group instead\nof staying with Springtime , precisely because he believes in subsidised\ntheatres .\n\n\n\" Chung Ying needs me , I want to be there or explore , or else\nwe will die in public taste , &rdquo; he says . \n\n \n\nIn springtime  ' s past 15 productions , Clifton Ko has tested\ndifferent formulas and says he is now much better at sizing up market tastes .\n\n\n\" We did adaptations , comedies and musicals , but I think\npeople are looking for that special chemistry , &rdquo; he says . \n\n \n\nThe chemistry comes from casting the right people in the right\nroles .\n\n\n\" I am not selling celebrities in my show , &rdquo; Clifton Ko\nsays , although he did cast the 60s screen goddess Chan Po-chu in 1997's \nSentimental Journey  .\n\n\n\" I chose her because she had great stage experience .\n\n\nAnd it just so happens that she has legions of fans .\n\n\nIt doesn't mean I am going to cast Nicholas Tse just because he is\npopular with young girls . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nIt will be a challenge for Springtime to stay on top .\n\n\nMany entertainment companies are catching the wave .\n\n\nThe Emperor Entertainment Group and TVB have both staged successful\nshows of their own and are advertising new ones with stars like Tony Leung\nKar-fai , Dodo Cheung Yu-ling and Carina Lau Ka-ling . \n\n \n\n\" Competition is good , it pushes me , &rdquo; Clifton Ko\nsays .\n\n\nHe is quick to add that springtime still holds the record of 150\nconsecutive regional shows with the play  Butterflies Are Free  .\n\n\n \n\nAll this and Clifton Ko says he almost gave up everything for a\nquiet life in Hawaii .\n\n\n\" I was all packed up and ready to go in 1995 , &rdquo; Clifton\nJo , 43 , says from his office that overlooks a grey street in the grimy\ncommercial district of Kwun Tong .\n\n\nHe was 38 then , had made several successful films but the industry\nwas beginning to falter .\n\n\nHe wanted to retire early and watch his two daughters grow up .\n\n\nHe even bought a home in Honolulu .\n\n\nThen he saw a play produced by the Hong Kong Repertory Theatre called\n I Have A Date With Spring  , which starred several unknown actors .\n\n\n\" If it wasn't for  Spring  , I think I would be lying\non the beach getting fat . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nHe made the play into a film , which become a surprise hit , and\nthen made the bold move of bringing  Spring  back to the stage for a\nstaggering 70-show run .\n\n\nWhat began as a part-time project has come a long way .\n\n\n\" I just don't want to see Hong Kong being invaded by Disney\nand the Really Useful Company , &rdquo; he says . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Outstanding conduct   \n\n\n Three Tenors ' conductor Janos Acs is the hard-working , unsung\nhero of one of the greatest shows on Earth , but you won't hear him complain\n, as  Desiree Au  reports  \n\n \n\n CONDUCTOR JANOS ACS  apparently isn't in the best\nof moods . \n\n \n\nIt has been a taxing week for the Hungarian Acs , who will be\nconducting The Three Tenors concerts at Beijing  ' s Forbidden City tomorrow\nand Pavarotti  ' s solo concert in Hong Kong next Wednesday . \n\n \n\nWith Pavarotti  ' s sudden decision to postpone his Hong Kong\nengagement to be with his promoter , Tibor Rudas , who is suffering an ear\ninfection , Acs found himself having to frantically re-arrange rehearsals\nbetween the two cities . \n\n \n\nBut images of a grumpy conductor quickly gave way to a kinder ,\ngentler man when Acs , 49 , sits down for the interview . \n\n \n\n\" I though it would be impossible , but in the end it\nturned out OK because we are just travelling within Asia , &rdquo; Acs says .\n\n\n\" I need at least six rehearsals before a concert , and I am\ntold the Hong Kong Sinfonietta will only allow rehearsals up to three hours\nper day .\n\n\nThere is a lot of work to do in a very short time . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nIs he upset with Pavarotti ?\n\n\n\" No , I actually see it as the sign of a great musician , his\nvoice is so dependent on his psychological well-being , &rdquo; Acs says .\n\n\n\" In 10 years of working with him , this is the second time he\nhas cancelled a concert .\n\n\nRudas is probably one of the most important people in his life and I  ' m\nabsolutely sticking with Luciano .\n\n\nHe  ' s a good man and takes his engagements very seriously . &rdquo;\n\n\n \n\nLike the demanding , fickle superstars he frequently works with\n, Acs has a reputation for toughness .\n\n\nWith less than a week to prepare the Hong Kong Sinfonietta and the\nSymphony Orchestra of the national Opera of China , the latter of which will\nbe watched live by an estimated two billion people on television , Acs is\nrunning a boot camp for musicians . \n\n \n\n\" I have a difficult job , &rdquo; he admits .\n\n\n\" I have to put in a lot of energy , especially in the\nbeginning .\n\n\nMost orchestras have never played operas before , and the tempo\nchanges very quickly , something they  ' re not used to with classical\nrepertoires .\n\n\nYou have to make that clear to 70 people . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nIt  ' s not all work and no play .\n\n\nAcs entered the rehearsal room to find the folk from the Peak  ' s\nMadame Tussard  ' s wax museum had placed the wax figure of Luciano Pavarotti\nsmack in the middle .\n\n\nHe broke into laughter and went and hugged the form of his dear\nfriend and colleague . \n\n \n\nLike his contemporaries Zubin Mehta and James Levine , Acs has\nthe privilege of being associated with the biggest and most profitable names\nin classical music , the Three Tenors .\n\n\nHe is particularly close to Pavarotti , having been the tenor  ' s\npersonal pianist for 10 years and conducted his solo concerts in Amsterdam ,\nVenezuela and his hometown , Budapest . \n\n \n\nAcs met Pavarotti , 66 , 10 years ago when the tenor popped in\nto a rehearsal at a talent agency run by Pavarotti  ' s ex-wife , Adua Veroni ,\nfound Acs accompanying a youthful tenor in a piece by Mascagni .\n\n\n\" He was so surprised that a Hungarian can have such great\nfeelings for music written by Italians he invited me to go to his home in\nItaly , &rdquo; Acs recalls . \n\n \n\n\" We got along great , and Pavarotti asked me to conduct\nhis concert in Budapest in 1991 . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nBut even before that meeting , Acs was one of opera  ' s most\nsought-after conductors .\n\n\nAt age seven he joined the choir of the Budapest State Opera , a\n200-year-old institution that counts Gustav Mahler among its musical\ndirectors . \n\n \n\nAcs has lived in Italy for 25 years and got his first break as a\nrepetiteur at La Scala in Milan and Teatro Comunale in Florence , where he\naccompanied singers such as Katia Ricciarelli and Mariella Davis , before\ntaking artistic directorships at opera house in Pretoria , South Africa , and\nColorado in the US . \n\n \n\nBut it is his work with the Three Tenors that Acs finds the most\nintensive and rewarding .\n\n\nWhat is it like to be so close to them ?\n\n\n\" They are just amazing people , with a gift of voice , a\nsense of concentration and such strong responsibility .\n\n\nTo be number one , it takes the coordination of one  ' s emotions ,\ntalents and mind .\n\n\nOnce you hear them sing , it  ' s something you never forget . \n\n \n\n\" When things are going right they are pretty relaxed and\nhappy , but moments before each show they each retreat to their own dressing\nroom , &rdquo; he says .\n\n\n\" I think what happens at that time is between them and God .\n&rdquo; \n\n \n\nBut he doesn't only see his future with the Three Tenors .\n\n\n\" The money is good , but I want something else , &rdquo;

I  ' m\nnot aware this is one of the causes for staff turnover . \n\n \n\n\" Our personnel department has done exit interviews on\nthose leaving the bank and this has not come up . \n\n \n\n\" There are two main reasons for staff departure which are\neither because they want to further their education or to switch to other\nfields . \n\n \n\n\" Many of the young staff members who are Form Seven\ngraduates came to work without deciding whether they wanted a career in\nbanking, &rdquo; she said . \n\n \n\nMiss Yu said they would look into security at banks in\nconjunction with police . \n\n \n\nHowever , she maintained they had to strike a balance between\ncustomer friendliness and security . \n\n \n\nShe declined to elaborate on how the bank would improve security\nor what was the staff turnover rate . \n\n \n\nMiss Yu said she did not know how many times the bank offices had\nbeen robbed , but claimed management was concerned about the safety of staff\nmembers and customers . \n\n \n\n\" I can't say how we instruct staff to deal with bank\nrobbery for security reasons , but we have taken steps to allay their fears\nin the light of the raids, &rdquo; she added . \n\n \n\nThe first of two raids yesterday happened at about 10.45 am at\nthe Un Chau Street branch in Shamshuipo when a man approached counter five\nand produced a silver pistol . \n\n \n\nHe handed a slip to a 19-year-old teller who gave him\n&dollar;13,000 .\n\n\nShe activated the alarm after the man left carrying a pink plastic\nbag . \n\n \n\nJust before 2.30 pm , the branch at 287-299 Queen  ' s Road Central\nwas held up by a man claiming to have a gun . \n\n \n\nHe also approached counter five and passed the teller a slip of\npaper claiming he had a gun and he wanted big denomination notes . \n\n \n\nHe was given &dollar;40,000 all in &dollar;1,000 notes and he\nfled on foot . \n\n \n\nPolice were last night still searching for the robbers . \n\n\n \n\n\n One dead , dozens hurt in crashes   \n\n\n By JIMMY LEUNG  \n\n \n\nONE woman was killed and more than 40 people injured in three\nseparate traffic accidents yesterday involving buses and heavy vehicles .\n\n\n \n\nA 33-year-old woman died and 10 people were injured when a lorry\nploughed into a crowd at a pedestrian crossing in Kwun Tong at lunchtime .\n\n\n \n\nEarly in the morning , a bus driver and a passenger were\nseriously injured in a collision between two double-decker buses in Sha Tin .\n\n\n \n\nTwo other Kowloon Motor Bus vehicles were involved in a third\naccident at 8.30 pm in Ma Tau Wai in which five people were injured . \n\n \n\nPolice said the scene where the fatal crash took place at Kwun\nTong was a traffic black spot . \n\n \n\nThe tragedy occurred just before 1.13 pm when a container truck\nrammed into the back of a medium-sized goods vehicle stopped at traffic\nlights in Kwun Tong Road . \n\n \n\nThe lorry was pushed forward into a group of workers crossing the\nroad during the lunch-break . \n\n \n\nThree people were trapped under the lorry and had to be freed by\nfiremen . \n\n \n\nThe air was filled with screams from victims and the sound of\nsirens from police motorcycles , fire engines and ambulances . \n\n \n\nWomen  ' s shoes , broken glass , bloodstains and a credit card\nwere scattered near the scene . \n\n \n\nTwo men and six women aged between 25 and 70 were taken to the\nUnited Christian Hospital , where Miss Lee Fung-ying , 33 , was certified\ndead on arrival .\n\n\nOne man and two women were last night in a stable to satisfactory\ncondition .\n\n\nThe rest were treated and discharged . \n\n \n\nThree women were taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital .\n\n\nMiss Cheung Hau-chun , 42 , sustained serious head injuries and was\nin an ill condition .\n\n\nTwo other women aged 27 and 42 were in fair condition . \n\n \n\nSpeaking at the observation ward of the United Christian Hospital\n, 31-year-old Miss Hui Hon-fong said she thought it was safe to cross the\nroad because the green light for pedestrians was flashing . \n\n \n\n\" All the cars had stopped to allow us to cross but all of\na sudden a goods vehicle on the fast lane surged forward and hit us . \n\n \n\n\" I was told later that the goods vehicle was rammed from\nbehind by a container truck which could not brake in front of the traffic\nlights in time, &rdquo;

\n\n \n\nThe committee  ' s report was based on views expressed by NPC\ndelegates on Finance Minister Mr Liu Zhongli  ' s provisional 1993 budget\ntabled at the plenum . \n\n \n\nAccording to Mr Liu  ' s report , the budget deficit for last year\nwas 23.75 billion yuan ( about HK&dollar;32 billion ) ,\ncompared with 21.11 billion yuan for 1991 . \n\n \n\nMaintaining that the financial situation of the state remained\ndifficult , the committee proposed a series of measures to help reduce\ndeficits . \n\n \n\nThe committee urged local authorities to stick to the principle of\na balanced budget , adding \" no deficits should occur in the process of\nimplementation &rdquo; . \n\n \n\nThe State Council should take effective measures to strictly\ncontrol the budget implementation and try to reduce the deficit earlier than\nforecasted , it said . \n\n \n\nThe committee called on the relevant departments under the State\nCouncil to accelerate the drafting of laws concerning taxation and budgets .\n\n\n \n\nA set of laws on budgets should be tabled to the NPC Standing\nCommittee for study this year so it could be forwarded for approval at next\nyear  ' s plenary session . \n\n \n\nThe committee said the Government should take measures to ensure\nlaws on taxation were strictly enforced and publicised so the public was\naware of the significance of their duties to pay tax .  \n\n \n\n\n Trade body to be trouble-shooter  \n\n \n\nTHE newly-established State Economic and Trade Commission will\nact as a trouble-shooter in the development of China  ' s market economy ,\naccording to its chairman , Mr Wang Zhongyu . \n\n \n\nMr Wang said the 300-strong commission would look into specific\nproblems arising in the course of the development of the socialist market\neconomy and give remedies . \n\n \n\nTop priority of his ministerial-level commission is to study\nproblems incurred by changes to the public ownership system and the operation\nof state-owned enterprises . \n\n \n\nMr Wang indicated that matters such as the long-term and\nmacro-level plan of the economy remained under the jurisdiction of the State\nPlanning Commission . \n\n \n\nMr Wang is one of 22 new faces in the 41 ministries to be named\nby the Prime Minister , Mr Li Peng , at the NPC today . \n\n \n\nMeanwhile , the head of the newly-formed economic ministry in\ncharge of domestic trade said the restructuring plan of the State Council\nwould boost the development of a market economy . \n\n \n\nMr Zhang Haorao , who will head the Ministry of Internal Trade\n-; a merger of the former Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of\nCommodities -; said , under the old system , most goods were produced\nunder a quota system set by the Government regardless of the market situation .\n\n\n \n\nThis had resulted in the stock-piling of goods and an enormous\nwaste of resources . \n\n \n\nMr Zhang said his new ministry would seek a balance between the\nproduction of goods and market demand . \n\n \n\nAlthough the Government would try to rely more on domestic\nsupplies , he said foreign supplies and technology were needed to upgrade\nChina  ' s industry . \n\n \n\nThe new minister said his office would work closely with the\nMinistry of Foreign Economic and Trade Co-operation , which will be headed by\nnoted trade negotiator Ms Wu Yi . \n\n \n\nMr Zhang said : \" It might be difficult to clearly\ndelineate domestic and external trade .\n\n\nSome foreign enterprises have also engaged in domestic trade .\n\n\nThe contrary is also true . &rdquo;

had shown\nsigns of a revival . \n\n \n\nIt claimed that these unspecified elements had attempted to\nsabotage economic reform as well as the stability of the country . \n\n \n\n\" Party members , workers and students are asked not to\ntake to the streets no matter what happens, &rdquo; a source said . \n\n \n\nThe directive came less than a fortnight after the party had\nissued a document to colleges and high schools , warning against the\nemergence of signs of dissent on campus since early last month . \n\n \n\nThe school authorities were asked to take \" resolute and\ntough &rdquo; measures to clamp down on such activities . \n\n \n\nSigns of the revival of student unrest emerged at Beijing\nUniversity last month when a group of student activists planned to stage a\n\" walkabout &rdquo; at the end of a candlelight rock'n'roll concert .\n\n\n \n\nPolice , who knew of the plan in advance , detained three\nstudents in the middle of the concert .\n\n\nThey were freed after 24 hours of questioning . \n\n \n\nThe authorities were also targeting attempts by dissidents taking\nadvantage of Beijing  ' s bid to host the 2000 Olympics to put pressure on the\nGovernment for greater democracy and improvements in human rights . \n\n \n\nA source said the jailed \" black hand &rdquo; dissident ,\nWang Juntao , would begin an indefinite hunger strike on Friday to press for\nhis release on medical parole . \n\n \n\nNow in hospital , Mr Wang is said to have heart and liver\nproblems . \n\n \n\nBut the source said it was unlikely there would be strong mass\nprotests to mark the June 4 anniversary . \n\n \n\n\" Yes , there are still some active elements among students\nand intellectuals who want to do something this year .\n\n\nBut it is not likely that they will get strong support, &rdquo; he\nsaid . \n\n \n\n\" The mainstream view among intellectuals is that radical\npolitical protests will not do the country any good . \n\n \n\n\" Furthermore , political unrest will be used as an excuse\nfor the conservatives to roll back reforms . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nSecurity checks in leading universities , such as the Beijing\nUniversity and the People  ' s University , have noticeably increased in the\npast few weeks . \n\n \n\nMore regular and plain-clothes police have been deployed in the\ncollege district . \n\n \n\nThe source said : \" June 4 has become a &lsquo; complex\n&rsquo; .\n\n\nThey will now raise precautions every year to prevent unrest .\n\n\nThis year is more important because of the 2000 Olympics bid .\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\n\n Vow to continue economic reform   \n\n\n By CHRIS YEUNG in Shijiazhuang , Hebei  \n\n \n\nCHINA will not put a brake on its reform drive despite signs of\nthe economy overheating , according to the party chief of Hebei province ,\nCheng Weigao . \n\n \n\n\" The solution still lies with the improvement in\nmacro-level supervision of the economy .\n\n\nThe ultimate goal is to maintain the present momentum of reforms,\n&rdquo; he said yesterday . \n\n \n\nMr Cheng , the party boss of the province closest to Beijing , is\noptimistic that signs of overheating will not jeopardise the overall economy .\n\n\n \n\n\" The economy is good and normal, &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\nHe maintained that the province and the party centre agreed on\nthe issue . \n\n \n\n\" We are determined not to have any U-turn of policy in\nthe future .\n\n\nTherefore , the economic reform drive will not abruptly halt,\n&rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\nHe pointed out that problems arising in the course of reforms\ncould only be solved by intensifying reforms . \n\n \n\nFor instance , he said the shortage of funds should be solved by\nimproving the management of the monetary system and macro-level supervision\nas well as investment on fixed assets . \n\n \n\nThe lack of funds made it imperative for the province to open\nits doors wider to foreign investors , Mr Cheng said . \n\n \n\nDeputy Governor of the province , Chen Liyou , said : \"\nThe problems with the economy have not reached the crisis level that\nendangers the whole economy or leads to any serious imbalance . \n\n \n\n\" The fact that the party centre and the provinces have\nbeen alert about the issue shows that we are sober-minded and objective .\n\n\nWe are confident that the economy remains sound, &rdquo; said Mr\nChen , who is in charge of economic matters . \n\n \n\nHebei is to hold a large-scale trade fair in Hongkong next month\nto help bridge its gap with the outside world . \n\n \n\nRepeating statements made by state leaders that the region\nsurrounding the Bay of Bohai will be another major area for reform in the\nnext decade , Mr Cheng is confident that the centre of foreign investments\nwill gradually shift northwards from the south coast . \n\n \n\n\" I  ' ve told our cadres that does not necessarily mean\nthat funds will flow into Hebei .\n\n\nThe most important thing is still the improvement in our environment\nfor investment . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nMr Cheng said he was convinced the province would become an\nattraction for investors because of its geographical location , endowment of\nnatural resources , the abundant supply of expertise as well as its\npreferential policies . \n\n \n\nMore importantly , Mr Cheng said Hebei would benefit from the\nsuccess of the two municipal cities -; Beijing and Tianjin -; which\nlie within the province geographically but are separated from it under China  ' s\nadministrative system . \n\n \n\nMr Cheng said : \" We want to play down our political\nseparation ( between the province and the two municipalities )\nand emphasise our economic links . \n\n \n\n\" Through the links with Beijing , we can attract more\ninvestors and reach the world .\n\n\nWe will meet soon to map our strategy in bridging the links between\nthe two . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nBeijing will also benefit from the increased links with the\nregion , he said .  \n\n \n\n\n Actress markets stage persona to aid culture   \n\n\n From CHRIS YEUNG in Beijing  \n\n \n\nACTRESS Ms Huang Wanqiu , better known as Liu Sanjie , has put a\nlegend rooted in scenic Guilin into the service of an enterprise helping to\npromote Chinese culture . \n\n \n\nUnder the banner of the Guilin Star Enterprise ( Group\n) Company , Ms Huang , who has played the role of Sanjie (\nliterally \" third elder sister &rdquo; ) in the Chinese folk\nlegend on the stage , is now leading a team of 1,000 staff and a conglomerate\nwith assets of more than 64 million yuan ( HK&dollar;86.2 million\n) . \n\n \n\nThe company also plans to set up a joint venture with a Hongkong\nbusinessman to invest HK&dollar;150 million in the construction of buildings\nin the Guangxi provincial capital . \n\n \n\nLiu Sanjie , the daughter of a fishing family from the Li River\nin Guilin , is now the name of a canned food shop , an artists group and\ninvestment company , an advertising company , a travel agency , video and\nmusic company , a shopping mall . \n\n \n\nDating back centuries , the legendary Sanjie , known for her wit\nand bravery , is a symbol of the masses who resisted feudalism and\nsuppression by landlords . \n\n \n\nThe idea of setting up an enterprise under the name of Liu\nSanjie was mooted last year when Ms Huang was heading a group to perform the\nopera story in Malaysia and Hongkong . \n\n \n\n\" I was surprised by the warm response from the audience ,\nparticularly the Chinese ... I think that was a chance . \n\n \n\n\" We cannot just rely on the river and the stone\nlandscapes ( along the Li River ) to attract tourists .\n\n\nWe have to promote our distinct culture to combine with the scenic\nattractions . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe 49-year-old actress believes that there is also a role for\nartists to play in propagating senior leader Mr Deng Xiaoping line of\nsocialist economic development while promoting Chinese culture . \n\n \n\nPart of the revenue generated by the enterprise will go to\nfunding the Liu Sanjie Opera Group , which is to promote the traditional\nculture of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region . \n\n \n\nMs Huang said : \" Culture and arts groups have faced\nenormous financial difficulties .\n\n\nAs television , videos and satellite television became more popular\n, fewer people now go to watch traditional arts . \n\n \n\n\" Although the Government still gives wages to many\nartists , we want to have greater autonomy in managing our finances, &rdquo;\nshe said .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "83b452a7-9f34-4b41-967b-874e1018518a", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.067653+00:00"}
{"text": "1 \n \n\n\" Assessment , as we conceive it , consists in a systematic\nprocess of analysis and Synthesis &rdquo; .\n\n\nWith reference to this statement , several points need to pay\nattention , i.e. the tri-foci model of assessment is a systematic process\n&semi; it consists of analysis of several areas; and it is a synthesis of the\ndata generated from the analysis . \n \n\nTri-foci model is a systematic process of assessment .\n\n\nSuch systematic process is useful to social workers because it\nprovides directions for social workers to follow , both in direction and\ncontent .\n\n\nAlthough it does not point out the ways to intervention , it provides\nus with a correct direction .\n\n\nIn the first sense , tri-foci model provides us the content for\nanalysis .\n\n\nAs the name implies , it consists of three areas for assessment .\n\n\nThe first one id the demand of life tasks .\n\n\nSuch life tasks may   derive  from the\nmaturation process of individual e.g. the transition from adult to elderly .\n\n\nIt may stem from transition/demand of external systems .\n\n\nSuch demands cause burden to individuals .\n\n\nAlso this can also be generalized to demands other than the demands\nfrom life tasks , e.g. stress caused by psychological factors ,  like fear . \n \n\nThe second foci is the natural system e.g. family .\n\n\nThe third foci is the societal system e.g. formal organizations like\nschool , work place .\n\n\nSo the tri-foci model provides us the content of assessment , without\nconsidering such foci assessment is incomplete . \n \n\nAnother than pointing the content of assessment , it also\nprovides us the steps ( phasic ) in doing assessment .\n\n\nThe first step is the collection of data from the three foci .\n\n\nAfter gathering such data , together with knowledge acquired by\nsocial workers , some hypothesis are generated .\n\n\nFurther data are collected in order to proved or nullify the\nhypothesis .\n\n\nThis is the process of analysing data .\n\n\nIf the hypothesis is proved to be correct match the reality , then\nthe next step is the assessment of the situation .\n\n\nSo the tri-foci model s useful to social workers because it is a\nsystematic process as measured by its content and its procedures .\n\n\nIt must lie point out that such model can extend to nearly all social\nworker intervention methods by extending the concepts . \n \n\nIt is also useful because the model is embedded in a large\nprocess of the helping process .\n\n\nIn the generalist approach of social work , intervention can be\nbroadly classified into three phases namely ( 1 ) the beginning\nphase - emphasis on engagement of client , preliminary contract formulation ,\ncollection of data ( 2 ) the middle phase - the action phase -\nincluding assessment , goal formulation and actions ( 3 )\nending phase - for termination and evaluation .\n\n\nIn this process model , assessment plays an important part .\n\n\nIf no accurate assessment can be formulated , no desirable\nchanges/interventions are possible .\n\n\nThe tri-foci model provides a frame-work for assessment .\n\n\nIts usefulness fall within its comprehensiveness of assessment . \n \n\nAs seen from the above , I can see that the tri-foci model\nprovides a systematic process of analysis .\n\n\nIt is also a systematic process of synthesis .\n\n\nSynthesis means the assessment of data collected .\n\n\nIn the process of assessment people needs to formulate hypothesis\ngenerated from data collected &ampersand; the workers  '  knowledge .\n\n\nSuch process is indeed a process of synthesis: synthesis of data\n&ampersand; knowledge .\n\n\nIn Marxist term synthesis is important in   \ndialectic   .\n\n\nSynthesis means the combination of thesis and anti-thesis .\n\n\nSuch combination is not a mixture of thesis &ampersand; anti-thesis .\n\n\nIt is a new one .\n\n\nThus in the process of assessment , different data collected may\ncontradict with each other ( this is often the case especially found\nin family cases ) Thus synthesis is important as it give workers a new\nperspective . \n \n\nThe model is useful because it can point out the intervention\napproach .\n\n\nFor example if the assessment found that the problem lies within the\nindividual , then case work or group work approach will be appropriate .\n\n\nIf the problem lies in the natural system e.g. family , then family\ntherapy is recommended .\n\n\nIf the problem lies in the societal organization , community work is\nrecommended . \n \n\nAs a conclusion , tri-foci model gives us a direction and a\ncomprehensive way of assessment .\n\n\nSuch assessment is the base of future intervention .\n\n\nIt is the foundation of social practice .\n\n\nIf social worker tries to solve problem , we must know what is the\nproblem .  \n\n\n6 \n \n\nIn promoting organization change from within organization is\nquite difficult especially if the change is initiated from below i.e. low\nrank staff .\n\n\nPatti and other social worker practitioners , like Frey , have\nproposed different frameworks to assess the resistance of change in an\norganization .\n\n\nGenerally speaking , resistances to change include the following\nfactors:\n\n\n1.\n\n\nThe nature of change\n\n\n2. Value orientations of decision makers\n\n\n3. Organizational Distance -; the change agent  ' s distance with\ndecision makers\n\n\n4. Sunk cost -; efforts invest by the organization\n\n\n5. Organizational History towards change\n\n\n6. Cultural Background \n \n\nTo me , the first two factors are important in the analysis of\nresistance to change .\n\n\nChange here mean any modification/deletion of procedures , goals ,\nobjectives , etc .\n\n\nI further assume that the change agent  ' s intention is good , i.e.\nnot shifting of responsibility , etc .\n\n\nAlso the change proposal quality is not a question . \n \n\nThe first factor of resistance to change is the nature of change\ni.e. the courage of the change .\n\n\nIt can be further divided into 2 dimensions i.e. scope of change and\ndepth of change .\n\n\nThe scope of change means the area of change affected .\n\n\nIt may be a component , a sub-system or the whole system .\n\n\nThe depth of change may be a procedural one , a programmatic one or a\nbasic one . \n \n\nFrom the above , we can find that resistance will increase if we\ngo from left to right and from top to down .\n\n\nThus we may find that change in procedure in a component is the\neasiest one .\n\n\nChange involves a system and it is a basic change , resistance will\nbe the greatest . \n \n\nAs implied from the above analysis , the change agent must pay\nattention to the nature of change .\n\n\nIf he wants to change , it is effective if it start from one\ncomponent first and then generalize to sub-system and then the while system .\n\n\nSuch procedure will not give threat to other component/decision\nmakers , it is because it provides a model and a demonstration effect .\n\n\nApply the same logic , change best starts from a procedural one .\n\n\nTogether with this point , the change agent must also aware of the\npotential risk caused by the change .\n\n\nHigh risk proposal includes changes that are changes that once starts\nit cannot stop .\n\n\nThus the change proposal  employing a incrementalistic\nmanner/steps by steps will expect less resistance . \n \n\nThe second factor that affecting the acceptance of the change\nproposal in the value orientation of decision makers .\n\n\nDecision makers include board-members , executives , administrators\ndirectors .\n\n\nSuch people holds the position that is crucial in the acceptance of\nthe change proposal . \n \n\nThe value holds by the decision makers including , prestige ,\npower , income , safety , status , ...etc .\n\n\nSuch values do exist in every decision makers .\n\n\nThese value will affect whether the change proposal is accept or not .\n\n\nIf the   perceived  benefits coincide with\nthe value of the decision-makers , it will likely the proposal be accepted .\n\n\nIt must be pointed out that every people will have a mixture of\nvalues , the problem is how such value is arranged in the hierarchy .\n\n\nThus it is important for us to have an understanding about this\nhierarchy . \n \n\nIt is very interesting to notice that values usually appear in\ngroup/clusters .\n\n\nGenerally speaking , decision makers can be classified into climber\nand conserver .\n\n\nConserver will value what he has in hand .\n\n\nSo he is not likely to accept change proposal that affect the status\nquo .\n\n\nHe will tend to accept proposals that not intending to \"\nchange&rdquo; .\n\n\nHe will treasure stability .\n\n\nIf we use the innovative consolidation continuum , he will fall in\nthe consolidation end .\n\n\nAnother type of people is the climber .\n\n\nHe will try efforts to gain power , prestige etc .\n\n\nHe inclines to accept proposals that brings power to him .\n\n\nUnder the innovative consolidation continuum , he may shift from one\nend to another depending on situation . \n \n\nAnother type of person that we need to pay attention is the\nprofessional advocacy .\n\n\nHe will tend to accept proposal that bring benefit to client or the\nprofession .\n\n\nThus proposal brings these change will he accepted by he . \n \n\nFrom this point , we can see that the  \nperceived  benefit to the decision-makers affect the acceptance of the\nproposal .\n\n\nIn order to overcome this , some skills can be used .\n\n\nThe most important one is the presentation skills .\n\n\nProposal must speak in the language of the decision makers , start\nwhere they are .\n\n\nThe distortion and condensation of ideas as the proposal may travel\na long \" distance&rdquo; before it reaches the decision makers .\n\n\nWe must also identify the goal hierarchy of the decision makers by\nreviewing the history of change under the decision of the decision makers in\norder to find out what kind of   perceived \nadvantages is effective .\n\n\nWe may also find out who is the real \" decision makers&rdquo;\n, i.e. who is the key person in the decision process .  \n\n\n2 \n \n\nBefore the exploration of reflection by social worker on his/her\nown feelings , values and perspectives , I would like to have a little remark\non what is mean by responsible social work practice .\n\n\nThe objectives of social work practice have long been a question .\n\n\nSome will argue that social work aims at enhancing people  ' s social\nfunction , some will say that   its  aim is the\naccommodation of life tasks .\n\n\nWhatever the objectives are , the common point is that all is\nconcerning about the well-being of people .\n\n\nArguments fall in different views about the well-being of individual\nor even society .\n\n\nHere the responsible social work practice means the promotion of\nwell being of individual/ society/system . \n \n\nTo say that reflection by the social worker on his/her own\nfeelings , values and perspectives is an integral part of responsible social\nwork practice , we can explore this in three ways : the scheme praxis , the\ncomprehensive frame-work of social work practice , and the mature of social\nwork practice . \n \n\nTo use the Marxist notion of praxis , we can see that at the top\nof the scheme it is the knowledge , theory and experience of social workers .\n\n\nPassing through the social reality and the  \n indeterminate   zone , it comes to the part of problem framing .\n\n\nThen it is intervention which involves clients , workers .\n\n\nThis is constrained by social norm , moral value .\n\n\nWorkers need to reflect &ampersand;  seizing  about these .\n\n \n\nIn the scheme , we can see the function of feelings &ampersand;\nvalues beliefs in problem framing .\n\n\nProblem framing needs the workers to consider about the feelings\n&ampersand; values/beliefs in the process .\n\n\nE.g. if the worker employs a liberal feminist ( a prevailing\nview in Hong Kong nowadays ) , then when she/he encounters family\nproblems she may employ such values .\n\n\nShe/he may consider the family to be lay on family decision process .\n\n\nThus she/he may encourage the women in question to participate in\nthe decision of family process , employment is needed as to open the scope of\nview or to redefine the burden of household duty .\n\n\nAnother example is concerning the political attitude of worker\ntowards 1997 .\n\n\nSuch 1997 crisis is the main concern of people .\n\n\nIf a community worker  ' s feeling towards 1997 is fear , his\nundervalue the coming of change of ownership to China and he has a negative\nperspective , then we may find that he encourage people to  \nflee  , to   emigrate  , to leave , to employ a\npassive attitude .\n\n\nBecause he consider the problem lay in China which cannot be changed\nwithin a period of time .\n\n\nIf the situation is reversed , he may employ a constructive way to\nhandle 1997 , e.g. understanding China  ' s situation , try to protect human\nrights tgrough legislation at present, try to promote the economic progress\nof China , ...etc .\n\n\nThus we can see that    feelings  \n&ampersand; value play an important role in the process of problem frame .\n\n\nThis leads to different strategies of change/intervention which are\nthe result of problem framing .\n\n\nSuch intervention points to the well being of people . \n \n\nIn the top of the scheme , it is the knowledge , experience and\ntheory .\n\n\nThis constitutes the theoretical perspective of workers ( to\nme , values , feeling and beliefs are also perspective employed by workers\n) Such perspective operated with the fusion of social reality forms\nthe base for problem framing . \n \n\nIn 1990  ' s , Hong Kong can be said to be dominated by the\nattitude of profit-making .\n\n\nIf such perspective is employed by social workers , he may consider\nthe well being of people to be the maximization of profit .\n\n\nSuch point of view is quite danger as we know that money will lead\nto the lose of  ' real  '  self which is not constituted by money . \n \n\nAs in the scheme of praxis , societal norms &ampersand;

{"text": "1 Scholarship to England  \n\n \n\n I  n the early past of 1946 , the Hong Kong\ngovernment commemorated the capitulation of Japan by awarding the Victory\nScholarships , advertised as such , to local students , with no spring\nattached , to further their studies at various universities in the United\nKingdom .\n\n\nThere were many applicants for the award , from whom seven were\neventually chosen to share the five scholarships .\n\n\nI was one of the lucky seven , So was my younger brother Brain .\n\n\nIn those days , air travel was far less common than now .\n\n\nEven travel by sea was severely restricted because of the large number\nof ships sunk during the war .\n\n\nIt was not until late in August that year that the SS Menelaus , a\ncargo boat ploughing the South China seas , was available to take us to\nSingapore , where , after a further considerable delay and much red tape , we\nfinally set sail for England on board the troopship SS Britannic arriving in\nLiverpool only in the middle of October . \n\n \n\nOf the seven scholarship students from Hong Kong , three were\nadmitted into London University , one was admitted into Leeds University ,\nand one into Manchester University .\n\n\nI was accepted by Merton College , Oxford to read Politics ,\nPhilosophy and Economics , while my younger brother Brain gained admission\ninto Pembroke College , Cambridge to read Economics .\n\n\nThe Michaelmas term had already commenced when Brain and I finally\narrived at and settled into our respective colleges .\n\n\nBrain had taken a course in Economics as an undergraduate at Lingnan\nUniversity in China during the war .\n\n\nIt was only natural that he should want to carry on with the study of\nEconomics at Pembroke , I chose PPE for totally different reasons . \n\n \n\nIn point of fact , on the eve of departure from Hong Kong , my\nfather had urged me to read law and qualify as a barrister .\n\n\nHowever , I had other ideas .\n\n\nThe law and the legal profession , especially the Bar , were in those\ndays altogether unknown and alien to me , and , indeed , to most of the\nChinese population in Hong Kong .\n\n\nUntil then neither I nor any other member of my family was aware that\nanyone we knew had made a success of practising at the local Bar .\n\n\nBesides , I had spent several years in China during the war , had\nwitnessed the pitiful ignorance and poverty in most parts of the mainland ,\nand had pledged that I would return to do what little I could to better the\nlot of my people after receiving my education abroad .\n\n\nIn the circumstances I felt almost justified in turning a deaf ear to\nmy father  ' s advice . \n\n \n\nIf anyone were to have told me then that I would eventually end\nup reading law at Lincolin  ' s Inn in London and return to practise law in the\ncourts of Hong Kong , I would probably have laughed it off as sheer fantasy\non their part .\n\n\nI could hardly be expected to know that ere long subsequent events in\nChina would force upon me a different outlook for the future , that I would\nindeed as a result switch to studying and practising law , and be the first\none in the family to fulfil his parent  ' s dear wish . \n\n \n\nHowever , most of this later .  \n\n\n 2 A Seven Child  \n\n \n\nI was born on 22 August 1922 .\n\n\nNot that I know anything about it , other than that my birth\ncertificate says so .\n\n\nMy parents had four sons and seven daughters .\n\n\nI was their third son and seventh child .\n\n\nMy father was himself the seventh child of his parents .\n\n\nThe Chinese believe that the seventh child of a seventh child is\nspecially blessed .\n\n\nOver the years , I have certainly had a great measure of good fortune\nthan most of the people I know . \n\n \n\nMy first clear recollections as a child came with Nos . 15-17\nUpper Shelley Street .\n\n\nUntil the end of the last war , these consisted of two adjoining\ntwo-storey twin houses into which my family had moved when I was less than\nsix years old .\n\n\nShelly Street is divided into two sections .\n\n\nLower Shelley Street adjoins Hollywood Road at one end and Caine Road\nat the other .\n\n\nUpper Shelley Street is a street sloping walkway which is less than\ntwenty feet wide , and about two hundred yards long , bounded at the top by\nMosque Street , and at the bottom by Caine Road , with residential houses\nlining both sides of the street almost all the way with the exception of a\nlarge vegetable garden fenced by walls facing houses Nos . 15-17 directly\nacross the walkway .\n\n\nImmediately past the vegetable garden is the entrance to a Muslim\nmosque with surrounding walls which take up the rest of that side of the\nwalkway right up to Mosque Street .\n\n\nWalking up Shelley Street from Caine Road , one would , after some\nfifty yards , come to an opening on the right which leads into Prince  ' s\nTerrace . Lying another fifty yards further up and beyond this opening on the\nright would be Nos . 15-17 Upper Shelley Street . \n\n \n\nThe majority of the houses in this area are extremely close to or\notherwise actually adjoining one another .\n\n\nIn those days Nos . 15-17 Upper Shelley Street had the unique\ndistinction in the whole of that area of being able to boast of a long strip\nof verandah some three to four feet wide overhanging the walkway from the\nfirst floor and extending continuously over the entire frontage of the two\nhouses .\n\n\nThis overlooked not only the whole length of Shelley Street , but\nalso a vast area in the vicinity .\n\n\nStanding on this verandah one could even sight a part of the harbour\nand something of Kowloon for a long way beyond .\n\n\nWhen lined with pots of multi-coloured flowers , this unusual\nstructural addition to the property made a very attractive sight .\n\n\nVery regrettably this historic residence of my family was sold in the\n1950s , and has since been replaced by a mundane building of multiple storeys\nwith no verandah or view whatever . \n\n \n\nIt was at this address that I grew up together with my brothers\nPing Tsung and Brain .\n\n\nShortly after the family moved into Shelly Street , my eldest broth\nPak Chuen left for England and was soon joined by my eldest sister Sheung\nWoon .\n\n\nMy two other elder sisters Josephine and Margaret were then already\nattending school .\n\n\nMy two younger sisters Winnie and Rosalind came respectively into\nthis world at Shelley Street in 1929 and 1931 .\n\n\nYet another two sisters , one older and one younger than I , had died\nin their infancy .\n\n\nMy father was a Senior Inspector of Schools employed by the Hong Kong\ngovernment .\n\n\nAt dinner he frequently told us fascinating stories about our\nliterary giants and historic heroes which were unforgettable lessons in\nthemselves .\n\n\nOn Sundays , we would more often than not be taken to watch either a\ncinema film or a soccer match , to be followed by a meal in town in one of\nour favourite restaurants .\n\n\nThose were overwhelmingly happy years . \n\n \n\nMy brother Ping Tsung , who passed away in February , 1996 , was\none and a half years older than I .\n\n\nTogether we learnt our ABCs as well as our first Chinese characters\nat Nos. 15-17 Shelley Street .\n\n\nA Eurasian woman surnamed Shum was engaged to teach us English and\narithmetic , while a Chinese male tutor surnamed Li taught us Chinese .\n\n\nBeing much cleverer than I , Ping Tsung was naturally the teacher  ' s\nfavourite .\n\n\nIt did not explain , though , why Miss Shum should constantly find\nfault with me , frequently for no reason whatever .\n\n\nWhenever she picked on me unfairly , Ping Tsung would rally to my\nside , and do his utmost to console and comfort me .\n\n\nAlthough this did not always suffice to pacify my injured ego and\noutraged sense of justice , an intimate comradeship grew up between us as a\nresult which continued right through our school and university days as well\nas during and after the war . \n\n \n\nMy brother Brain is two years younger than myself .\n\n\nHe too received his initial education at Nos . 15-17 Upper Shelley\nStreet , save that he was given separate lessons from Ping Tsung and myself .\n\n\nThe three of us regularly played together when we were not at work .\n\n\nWe often pretended to divide the family residence into three separate\nkingdoms , and each of us would occupy one of them .\n\n\nWe would then play hide-and-seek fighting against one another as\nkings defending our respective realms . No . 15 and No . 17 Shelley Street in\nthose days each had a winding staircase led from the ground floor to a common\ndinning room straddling the first floor of both houses .\n\n\nA third smaller winding staircase led from the kitchen , the\nservants ' quarters , and an open yard at the rear of the ground floor of both\nhouses to a narrow corridor serving only the first floor of No . 15 , ending\nlikewise in the common dining room .\n\n\nThis intriguing layout offered ideal opportunities for our game .\n\n\nAlthough Ping Tsung won most of out imaginary combats , Brain and I\nenjoyed nonetheless the sheer excitement of dashing up and down the several\nstaircase trying to outmanoeuvre , outwit and outguess one another as if we\nwere seasoned strategists . \n\n \n\nAt the beginning of 1932 , my father decided that the time had\ncome for his three younger sons to go to school .\n\n\nAccordingly , he took us to see the headmaster of Wah Yan College ,\nthen situated at No . 2 Robinson Road . Robinson Road adjoins the east end of\nMosque Street and is no more than a stone  ' s throw from Shelley Street .\n\n\nThe school was then divided into eight grades .\n\n\nThe highest grade was class 1 which was the matriculation class .\n\n\nThe lowest class was class 8 . Ping Tsung and I were put into class 7\nwhile Brain was put into class .\n\n\nThus began my education at Wah Yan College .\n\n\nI was then nine years old .  \n\n\n 3 Wah Yan College and the Irish Jesuits  \n\n \n\nWalking every morning to Wah Yan and back again in the afternoon\nwas not only good exercise .\n\n\nAs I carried my books daily up Shelley Street across and beyond\nMosque Street into Robinson Road , I felt sheer be pride in being able to\nfend for myself at last , and no longer needing to be constantly watched over\nby my parents .\n\n\nSharing a classroom with some forty other students was also a new and\npleasurable experience .\n\n\nHitherto attending classes at home with Ping Tsung alone had\ninvariably given me an inferiority complex .\n\n\nThe discovery that not a few of the other students were not much\ncleverer than I , if at all , was in itself both comforting and reassuring .\n\n\nBesides , being the youngest member of my class , and more than\narticulate in expressing myself , I enjoyed more immediate attention from the\nteaches at Wah Yan than Miss Shum and Mr Li had ever shown me at home .\n\n\nThis gave me no small measure of a newly acquired confidence . \n\n \n\nWah Yan College was founded by Mr Peter Tsui in 1919 in Hollywood\nRoad with no more than a handful pupils at its inception .\n\n\nHowever the number of its students and classes grew steadily over the\nyears .\n\n\nIn 1921 , it moved into Nos . 2 Robinson Road .\n\n\nIn 1922 , it became a grant-in-aid secondary school with more than\none hundred students , after which its complement of students and classes\nincreased further from year to year .\n\n\nIn 1931 , it was sold to the Society of Jesus from Dublin , Ireland ,\nand was in due course taken over by the representatives of that religious\norder .\n\n\nUnder the expert supervision and management of the Irish Jesuits ,\nWah Yan College continued to expand and flourish in the years which followed\n, and had long since won recognition as one of the best-run and most\nsuccessful local secondary schools . \n\n \n\nIn 1932 , when admission into Wah Yan was sought by my sought by\nmy father for Ping Tsung , Brian , and myself , it was Fr Gallagher who\nreceived , interviewed , and admitted us .\n\n\nFr Gallagher was the first Irish Jesuit headmaster of Wah Yan .\n\n\nHe was a perpetually cheerful and affable man , whose somewhat stern\nlooks belied his gentle and selfess inner nature .\n\n\nAt first we could not help feeling a little afraid of him , but his\noverflowing friendliness quickly put us at our ease .\n\n\nIt did not take us long to discover that since becoming headmaster ,\nhe had readily won over the love and respect of all the teaches , staff , and\nstudents alike of the school . \n\n \n\nI owe a special debt of gratitude to Rev Fr D . Donnelly SJ who\ntaught me mathematics in 1936 , 1937 , and 1938 in Wah Yan College .\n\n\nWith Miss Shum as my former teacher , I had had no end of problems\nwith my arithmetic .\n\n\nThis continued initially in Wah Yan throughout 1932 , 1933 , 1934 and\n1935 .\n\n\nI experienced a similar difficult , although to a lesser degree ,\nwith algebra , geometry and trigonometry , when I was first taught those\nsubjects in 1934 and 1935 .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "1a6a4354-1c59-42b2-b7d0-690fa6df166e", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.070579+00:00"}

wanted to , you know .\n\n\nBut as I was saying , the time I guess I began to understand was\nwhen my aunt said my skin was too dark , and that dark skin was ugly on\nChinese girls .\n\n\nThat was the first thing .\n\n\nThen , my cousins began to tease me , and call me monkey .\n\n\nYou know how the Chinese always call the Malays monkey ?\n\n\nWell , that  ' s what they called me .\n\n\nGranny , how did you know I  ' d want to cry so much ?\n\n\nDid you know , once my cousins and I were playing during recess at\nschool .\n\n\nIt was right after I left you , so I must have been nine or ten .\n\n\nRight there , in the middle of the playground , they told everyone I\nwas half-person , half-monkey because I had a Malay mother .\n\n\nThe other Chinese kids all started laughing .\n\n\nI stood there .\n\n\nI didn't know what to say .\n\n\nI used your tree rule for the first time since I left you .\n\n\nI closed my eyes , and tried to see the tree .\n\n\nI saw it .\n\n\nThe rough , patchy bark and spreading branches , those funny leaves\n, the rounded halves not quite matching .\n\n\nThen , I heard it , the soft whooshing sound of the buds blowing off\nthe tree , the hard rain of the buds hitting the path .\n\n\nThe other children stopped laughing when they saw me standing there\nwith my eyes closed .\n\n\nAnd they all went away .\n\n\nAfter that , I got scared because my cousins went home and told\ntheir mother I was crazy .\n\n\nMy aunt tried to get me to tell her what had happened , but I\nrefused because I knew the tree was none of her business .\n\n\nI wouldn't have cared about their calling me monkey , except that\nthey laughed at me .\n\n\nMy girl cousin told me once I could never marry a Chinese because I\nwas half monkey .\n\n\nWhen I said why not , my aunt said , don't you see , you stupid\nmonkey , you  ' re too ugly .\n\n\nI was so furious I shouted at my aunt , and told her you always said\nI was beautiful just like my mother .\n\n\nMy aunt said you were a crazy old woman .\n\n\nWhat I don't understand about you , Grandma , you  ' re Chinese .\n\n\nSo how come you think I  ' m beautiful . \n\n \n\nIt feels good to be off my feet , to be away from the spotlight\nand all the people telling me the same nonsense .\n\n\nHow good you look !\n\n\nWhat a wonderful job you did !\n\n\nI wish I had a tan like yours !\n\n\nI know they say other things about me behind my back .\n\n\nWell , I don't need to worry about them .\n\n\nI  ' ve got it made .\n\n\nHadn't really thought about it , but I like not wearing make-up and\nstupid designer dresses .\n\n\nThey paint me like a doll , and dress me up .\n\n\nThen , they send me out on the catwalk , or trap me in their cameras .\n\n\nI feel naked in front of them .\n\n\nMmmm .\n\n\nThis bed  ' s comfortable .\n\n\nNobody believed me , I don't think , when I said I had to come here\nto sell my house .\n\n\nIt  ' s fun to surprise people .\n\n\nEverything  ' s going to work out just fine .\n\n\nI  ' m only twenty , and I  ' m at the top of my profession with plenty\nof money .\n\n\nWhat could go wrong ?\n\n\nShe was tiny , no more than four feet ten , I  ' d say .\n\n\nShe used to say I shouldn't worry , shouldn't cry ... \n\n \n\n... oh you noticed , Granny .\n\n\nYes , I still wear it .\n\n\nYou didn't mind , did you , that I took it away from the body ?\n\n\nI knew you meant for me to have it .\n\n\nI remember the first time you showed it to me .\n\n\nYou said it was a tiny pendant for tiny people like us .\n\n\nI  ' m five-feet-seven now , Granny , taller than you ever expected me\nto be . \n\n \n\nYou told me the three oval , pale green jade pieces were the\nbuds from the raining tree .\n\n\nI believed you then .\n\n\nYet , even after I knew better , I liked to think of those jade\npieces as buds .\n\n\nYou also said the gold setting was a gift from the tree ghost .\n\n\nYou meant the pendant for me . \n\n \n\nThey were only going to bury that pendant with her .\n\n\nWhy shouldn't I have taken it ?\n\n\nI need to get some sleep .\n\n\nTired .\n\n\nThings move fast in Singapore .\n\n\nI like that .\n\n\nDon't have time to worry , or think about silly things .\n\n\nIt  ' s work all the time , seven days a week .\n\n\nGot to be efficient , professional .\n\n\nThat  ' s what the agency says .\n\n\nFunny city , Singapore .\n\n\nEven relaxing is fast .\n\n\nI never stop laughing , dancing , drinking .\n\n\nSomeone gave me marijuana the other night .\n\n\nThose foreigners !\n\n\nThey have everything .\n\n\nThe English and Australian photographers keep telling me to get out\nof Asia .\n\n\nThey say I  ' d do well in the West because I  ' m \" exotic\n&rdquo; .\n\n\nWho knows ?\n\n\nSingapore  ' s not like Kuala Lumpur .\n\n\nK.L.

have .\n\n\nHe said K.L . was a boring city in a boring country , and that if I\nknew what was good for me , I  ' d stay away from Malaysia .\n\n\nMakes sense to me .\n\n\nNeil and the others laughed when I said I was going to Port Dickson .\n\n\nI don't care that it  ' s not a big city here .\n\n\nIt  ' s country and quiet .\n\n\nSometimes , I like quiet .\n\n\nHalf monkey , I mean , Malay .\n\n\nIs it the Chinese half they like ?\n\n\nNeil said Malay girls were sexy , but slow . \n\n \n\nI tried to run away from K.L . when I was thirteen .\n\n\nI  ' m twenty now , Grandma .\n\n\nAll

our car was upsetting the ghosts of Mummy and Daddy .\n\n\nYou thought I was making that up , and that I was thinking about the\naccident .\n\n\nYou made up things all the time .\n\n\nBut let me finish .\n\n\nI had this big fight with Uncle and Auntie who wouldn't tell me you\nwere dying .\n\n\nI told them they were letting you die .\n\n\nI even told them they hated me because of Dad , because he  ' d\nmarried a Malay .\n\n\nI knew they wanted the house , which was why they kept me away from\nyou .\n\n\nI know they thought I was defiant and stubborn , but they were never\nnice to me

they were so superior ?\n\n\nAnyway , my uncle caught me trying to run away , and he said I\ndeserved to be beaten .\n\n\nA beating would have been better than listening to him say our\nfamily was crazy .\n\n\nHe called Dad an alcoholic , saying that  ' s why he crashed the car .\n\n\nAnd then he called Mum no better than a whore because she was cheap\nenough to be a model .\n\n\nHe said Dad was the craziest of all for marrying a monkey , and\nthrowing away his money on this big house in Port Dickson .\n\n\nI hated them , Granny , I hated them .\n\n\nMost of all , I hated being monkey .

.\n\n\nAll the girls say Neil likes me .\n\n\nHe does seem to .\n\n\nHe told me I could easily get a job in London , and said he  ' d use\nhis connections to help me .\n\n\nWhy do I have to think about all these things ?\n\n\nI don't want to get married .\n\n\nSingapore  ' s tiring .\n\n\nIt doesn't make me feel beautiful anymore .\n\n\nI  ' m sure Anita talks about me behind my back

you ?\n\n\nI can't hide anything from you .\n\n\nDo you think they  ' re lying to me , Granny ?\n\n\nEveryone lies .\n\n\nThey think it  ' s the best way to control you .\n\n\nLook at these clippings

{"text": "&dollar;4b boost to ease traffic snarls   \n\n\n By LOUIS NG  \n\n \n\nA TOTAL of &dollar;4 billion has been earmarked to build the\ncountry park section of the Route 3 Highway to alleviate the chronic stress\nof New Territories West traffic . \n\n \n\nIn the interim , another &dollar;1 billion would be spent to\nexpand the uphill sections of the existing Tuen Mun Highway to allow greater\ntraffic flow . \n\n \n\nMr Macleod made clear yesterday that the Tsing Yi to Au Tau\nsection of Route 3 would be given first priority . \n\n \n\n\" Increasing congestion for local traffic , together with\nour increasing links with Guangdong  ' s economy , make a new road to the\nborder essential , &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\n\" The first priority is Route 3 from Tsing Yi to Au Tau by\nway of a new bridge at Ting Kau , and a tunnel under the country park .\n&rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe Government hoped the project could be advanced in partnership\nwith the private sector . \n\n \n\nA total of &dollar;4 billion , calculated at 1994 prices , has\nbeen earmarked for the Government  ' s potential contribution on the project .\n\n\n \n\nMr Macleod said he would give the Legislative Council specific\nproposals after the summer recess . \n\n \n\nThe Secretary for Transport , Mr Michael Leung Man-kin , said\nearlier that the project would be started by 1995 and completed by 1998 at\nthe earliest . \n\n \n\nMr Macleod admitted in his Budget speech that traffic between\nTuen Mun and Kowloon had been under great pressure . \n\n \n\n\" The transport problems in this part of the New\nTerritories are the result of geography and the huge expansion in our trade\nwith China , &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\nFor immediate remedy , &dollar;1 billion will be spent to widen\nthe uphill section of the Tuen Mun Highway in Sham Tseng , Siu Lam and Ting\nKau from the existing three lanes to four lanes . \n\n \n\nMr Macleod  ' s new measures were welcomed by legislators and\nDistrict Board members . \n\n \n\nElected legislator of New Territories West , Mr Zachary Wong\nWai-yin , said : \" It is estimated the cost of the whole project needs\nabout &dollar;10 billion.\n\n\nBut with the capital injection from the Government now , I think\nprivate developers will be more eager to invest in the project . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nDistrict Board member Mr Yim Tin-sang said the administration\nshould ensure loaded trucks would be confined to the slow lane , and work on\nthe Route 3 country park section should begin no later than next year . \n\n\n \n\n\n Action pledged to tackle underspending problem  \n\n\n\n By LOUIS NG  \n\n \n\nA PUBLIC Works Progress Committee will be set up to oversee the\nimplementation of the capital works plan as part of the Government  ' s effort\nto address the serious underspending problem . \n\n \n\nMr Macleod also announced the establishment of a computerised\nmanagement system and more private sector participation to prevent delays .\n\n\n \n\nChaired by the Secretary for Works , Mr James Blake , the new\ncommittee will be modelled along the lines of the Airport Development\nSteering Committee , headed by the Chief Secretary , Sir David Ford , the\nmain objective of which is to monitor the progress of the airport core\nprojects . \n\n \n\nMr Blake  ' s role is similar to that of the former Director of\nPublic Works , a post now scrapped .\n\n\nThe director had overall management of works departments and his key\ntask was to ensure that the billions of dollars earmarked for projects was\nspent as scheduled . \n\n \n\n\" I have asked the Secretary for Works to tackle these\nproblems as a matter of urgency , &rdquo; Mr Macleod said yesterday . \n\n \n\nA major cause of the current slippage in public works projects is\nthat the works departments report to different policy secretaries , including\nMr Blake , the Secretary for Transport , Mr Michael Leung Man-kin , and the\nSecretary for Planning , Environment and Lands , Mr Tony Eason . \n\n \n\nMr Macleod said the overall management of public works should\nbecome more unified , \" so as to remove any doubt about where overall\nmanagement responsibility lies &rdquo; . \n\n \n\nWhile the Government considered appointing a new Director of\nPublic Works to co-ordinate the non-airport public works plan , the\nGovernment decided that Mr Blake could fulfil the role . \n\n \n\nA computerised information and management system will be\nintroduced to help Mr Blake to co-ordinate all works departments and branches .\n\n\n \n\n\" It has become clear that we need new measures to ensure\nthat there is effective liaison between those who design projects , those who\nundertake land acquisition for them , those who monitor their environmental\nimplications and those who implement the works , &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\nMr Macleod believed the new system would enable problems to be\nidentified and solved at an earlier stage . \n\n \n\nLast year , Mr Macleod announced underspending of &dollar;5.6\nbillion on public works . \n\n \n\nYesterday , he announced another &dollar;5 billion worth of works\nprojects delayed . \n\n \n\n\" It has to be faced that the main underspending is the\nresult of slower progress with our capital works programmes than we had\nplanned , &rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\n\" Members will not find this acceptable .\n\n\nNeither do I , &rdquo; he added . \n\n \n\nMr Macleod said some remedial measures had also been taken .\n\n\nThese included calling for tenders while tabling items to the Finance\nCommittee for funding , removing the bottle-neck of clearing year-end\npayments , and the introduction of tighter monitoring procedures . \n\n \n\nThe administration will also consider contracting out more\nGovernment projects to the private sector to maximise efficiency . \n\n \n\nIt would also approve more turnkey projects to quicken the pace\nof construction , Mr Macleod said . \n\n \n\nTurnkey projects are those where contractors are responsible for\nboth the design and the construction of a project . \n\n \n\nHowever , the secretary-general of the Hongkong Construction\nAssociation , Mr Patrick Chan Wing-tung , said Mr Macleod  ' s prescription was\nstill too vague to convince him that the situation could really be improved .\n\n\n \n\n\" We hope the new system can really improve efficiency .\n\n\nBut it may turn out to be an extension of the existing red tape ,\n&rdquo; he said . \n\n \n\nMr Chan criticised the Government for failing to pinpoint exactly\nthe cause of the delays . \n\n \n\nHe urged it to conduct a survey to check all departments which\ncaused delay and reveal the results to the public .  \n\n \n\n\n Architects complain of red tape  </h   \n\n\n By LOUIS NG  \n\n \n\nINCREASED bureaucratic red tape had contributed to a sluggish\nproperty market and encouraged developers to move to southern China instead ,\nthe Hongkong Institute of Architects claimed yesterday . \n\n \n\nPresident of the institute , Mr Dennis Lau Wing-kwong told the\nLegco panel on lands and works yesterday that the lengthy procedure for\ndealing with planning applications had created uncertainty . \n\n \n\nThe Government denied the process was protracted and said\nconsideration had to be given to the impact of applications on environment ,\ntransport and overall town planning . \n\n \n\nAccording to the institute  ' s estimate , it took an average of 14\nmonths for the approval of a master layout plan and another nine months for\nthe approval of landscape proposal . \n\n \n\nMr Lau said the period between the submission of planning\napplications to the completion of a project had on average extended from\nthree and a half years to five years . \n\n \n\nThe institute proposed a statutory processing period should be\nintroduced for the approval of master layout plan and landscape proposal ,\nwhich confined the maximum time to three months . \n\n \n\nLegislator Mr Chim Pui-chung also asked the Government to extend\nits performance pledges to the related departments to boost efficiency . \n\n \n\nBut Deputy Secretary for Planning , Environment and Lands Mr\nCanice Mak Chun-fong said over 92 per cent of applications for approval of\nmaster layout plan could be completed within two months . \n\n \n\nHe said only about three per cent of the total cases required\nmore than three months to processed .  \n\n \n\n\n Lau set for fight with MPs over passports   \n\n\n By LOUIS NG  \n\n \n\nINDEPENDENT legislator Emily Lau Wai-hing is prepared to be\ncold-shouldered by members of parliament when she visits London next week .\n\n\n \n\nMiss Lau is part of a four-member delegation lobbying Britain to\ndrop a plan forcing holders of Hongkong British Dependent Territory Citizens\n( BDTC ) passports to switch to British National Overseas\npassports in phases before 1997 . \n\n \n\nThe other members of the delegation are legislators Ronald\nArculli , Simon Ip Sik-on and James To Kun-sun . \n\n \n\nMiss Lau admitted yesterday there may be apathy among British\npoliticians on the issue .\n\n\n\" What we fear is a lack of interest right across the House ,\n&rdquo; she said , adding she would be surprised if she was warmly received .\n\n\n \n\n\" Some of their people are very upset when you talk about\nnationality .\n\n\nThey will be strident . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nUnder the scheme , the Hongkong population will be divided into\n10 groups with different deadlines to observe for changing passports , all\nbefore June 30 , 1997 , when the BDTC passports become invalid . \n\n \n\nLegislators said the scheme violated a British promise made in\nthe Sino-British Joint Declaration that Hongkong people could keep their BDTC\npassports until June 30 , 1997 . \n\n \n\nThe delegation will meet members of the House of Commons and the\nHouse of Lords during their four-day visit . \n\n \n\nAmong the members they will meet are former prime minister Lady\nThatcher , former foreign secretary Lord Howe and the Minister with special\nresponsibility for Hongkong , Alastair Goodlad . \n\n \n\nThey will also lobby for full British passports to be given to\n7,000 people in ethnic minorities in Hongkong , who fear they may become\nstateless after 1997 .  \n\n \n\n\n China in plea over military land transfer   \n\n\n By LOUIS NG  \n\n \n\nCHINA yesterday called for the needs of the People  ' s Liberation\nArmy ( PLA ) to be given priority in Sino-British discussions\nabout the transfer of military land in Hongkong . \n\n \n\nThe call came after Sino-British Joint Liaison Group ( JLG\n) defence experts failed to reach agreement after two days of meetings\non the issue . \n\n \n\nChina wants few of the 33 sites used by the British Garrison to\nbe re-developed before the handover . \n\n \n\nA force of 10,000 troops -; which China is said to be\nplanning to deploy in the territory after 1997 -; would tie up almost all\nthe land and buildings used by the British Garrison . \n\n \n\nChinese team leader Luo Jiahuan said after the four-hour meeting\nyesterday that priority should be given to the needs of the PLA , but denied\nreports that Beijing wanted Britain to leave all existing sites to its troops .\n\n\n \n\nHe said the future economic development of Hongkong should also\nbe considered , but the military land transfer should not be dealt with on a\nsite-by-site basis . \n\n \n\n\" We reject unilateral , piecemeal handling of any\nparticular site .\n\n\nWe suggest , through rational and friendly discussion between China\nand Britain , the problem of military land should be tackled as a whole ,\n&rdquo; Mr Luo said . \n\n \n\nHe declined to say whether he was referring to the recent removal\nof the HMS Tamar naval base to Stonecutters Island . \n\n \n\nChina has criticised the move . \n\n \n\nThe Tamar site in Central was the most valuable of the military\nsites , worth about &dollar;22 billion . \n\n \n\nMr Luo  ' s British counterpart , Alan Paul , described the\ndiscussions as useful . \n\n \n\nYesterday  ' s meeting was the second day of talks between the\ndefence experts .\n\n\nBoth sides said discussions would be continued .  \n\n \n\n\n HK on line for new bullet train link with Guangzhou \n \n\n\n By LOUIS NG  \n\n \n\nHONGKONG could have its own \" bullet train &rdquo; if the\nterritory adopts an ambitious rail development strategy for the 21st century .\n\n\n \n\nA new government consultancy report recommends the building of a\nHigh Speed Rail ( HSR ) link , similar to Japan  ' s bullet train\n, between Hongkong and Guangzhou . \n\n \n\nCapable of up to 300 kilometres an hour , such trains would cut\nthe current three-hour journey to just 30 minutes . \n\n \n\nThe report says an HSR link will be needed to accommodate the\nincreasing demands of cross-border traffic by the first decade of the next\ncentury . \n\n \n\n\" While there is no immediate need for Hongkong , strategic\nrail planning should consider long-term possibilities and any implications by\nway of alignment reserves and terminal facilities , &rdquo; the report said .\n\n\n \n\n\" The planning and development of HSR is a complex and\ndemanding process .\n\n\nHowever , the future development of the Pearl River Delta region and\neconomic links between the cities of south China require that such long-term\npossibilities are considered in the preparing of railway plans for Hongkong .\n&rdquo; \n\n \n\nAn entire new rail corridor would be needed if totally\nun-interrupted services were to be provided for the high speed link .\n\n\nThe report says it could operate a proposed \" Western Corridor\n&rdquo; from Shamshuipo to the border or use the existing Kowloon-Canton\nRailway link . But this would be at the expenses of speed . \n\n \n\nAt present , rail services account for 80 per cent of\ncross-border passenger volume , with the report estimating the existing rail\nmarket to Guangzhou at 7.5 million passengers a year.\n\n\nBut that figure will rise to nearly 20 million by 2011 . \n\n \n\nThe report also estimates that the whole Pearl River Delta could\nreach a population of more than 40 million by the turn of the century ,\ncompared with its existing 26.5 million people . \n\n \n\n\" The necessary transport links , particularly rail ,\ncould unlock a new economic take-off for inland China . &rdquo;", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "61b65ac2-3fd0-4869-aaf1-312b3b65c737", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.073556+00:00"}
{"text": "Law poses limits on tolerance of courts , government \n \n\n\n Party Politics   \n\n\nJames Tien \n\n \n\n WHENEVER THE  Court of Final Appeal (  CFA ) \ndeliberates on any immigration case , it too is on trial .\n\n\nOn trial , that is , in the court of public opinion .\n\n\nNo one forgets what happened in 1999 when the still-untested CFA\ninterpreted the Basic Law broadly in recognising the right of abode for tens\nof thousands of mainland children born to permanent residents of Hong Kong .\n\n\nThe Government almost immediately challenged the verdict by applying\nto the Standing Committee of the National People  ' s Congress (  NPC ) to\noverrule the CFA , so compromising judicial integrity in the eyes of many .\n\n\n \n\nThe CFA realised that its credibility was under scrutiny again\nwhen on July 20 it reached a pair of controversial and conflicting verdicts\nconcerning a child and a teenager whose plights have gripped the public .\n\n\nThe court in the first instance ruled that Chong Fung-yuen could stay\n, even though his parents ostensibly only came to Hong Kong as visitors in\norder to give birth to him . \n\n \n\nThe court decision astounded the Government , which was concerned\nthat thousands of other pregnant visitors from the mainland would now seek to\ncircumvent the law in the same way .\n\n\nThe administration is justifiably worried because Hong Kong is under\na constant state of immigration siege .\n\n\nMany claiming the right of abode guaranteed by the Basic Law demand\nurgent redress on compelling legal , constitutional and moral grounds .\n\n\nTo let the CFA verdict stand would only complicate a very difficult\nsituation and might undermine an orderly programme of family reunion . \n\n \n\nIn the past four years , there have been 2,202 reported cases -\n232 involving illegal immigrants - of mainland women delivering babies in\nHong Kong and seeking the right of abode for their offspring and , eventually\n, themselves .\n\n\nThe Government cannot encourage this trend when it is already\nstruggling to accommodate more than 150 legal arrivals from the mainland\nevery day within overtaxed social , health care , housing and education\nservices .\n\n\nI have been one of those advocating a radical review of the current\nimmigration policy and the addition of a new category of investors and\nskilled workers to generate the revenue to help defray some of the costs of\ncatering for these people .  \n\n \n\nWhat we cannot accept is a \" pregnancy backdoor &rdquo;\nthrough which some can get ahead of others in the long queue for family\nreunion .\n\n\nPrivilege for one may be justice denied for many more .\n\n\nBut though the Government did not want to make an exemption for\nFung-yuen , it has nonetheless opted not to challenge the CFA ruling by\nseeking another interpretation of the Basic Law from the NPC Standing\nCommittee . \n\n \n\nDirector of Immigration Ambrose Lee Siu-kwong has also promised\nto be extra vigilant and , with the co-operation of mainland authorities ,\nstop pregnant women from slipping into Hong Kong on two-way permits to give\nbirth and seek the right of abode .\n\n\nTo be lax is to invite abuse and deepen the injury to the aggrieved\ntens of thousands of permanent residents with split families and no immediate\nprospect of uniting with their loved ones in Hong Kong . \n\n \n\nOn July 20 , the CFA also reached another landmark decision in\nconsenting to the repatriation of 14-year-old Agnes Tam Nga-yin , a studious\npupil cherished by her classmates and teachers who have mobilised public\nopinion in her defence .\n\n\nAll of us were touched by the campaign for Agnes as hundreds of\npeople signed petitions , spread the word on the Internet and appealed for an\nexemption .\n\n\nTo them , it would be cruel to wrest the girl from her loving parents\nand return her to a place that is now alien and would hold an uncertain\nfuture . \n\n \n\nThe court , however , had no choice but to agree with the\nGovernment that the right of abode is for biological rather than adopted\nchildren of permanent residents .\n\n\nMany disagree with the judicial decision and also with the Government .\n\n\nThey say the principle of equality enshrined in law does not\ndiscriminate against children , adopted or not . \n\n \n\nI understand the Government  ' s quandary in wanting to be\ncompassionate and yet not wanting to tempt those who could fake adoptions - a\ncommon ploy for many in getting around immigration restrictions now and in\nyears gone by .\n\n\nFor the sake of consistency , Secretary for Security Regina Ip Lau\nSuk-yee has indicated the Government may opt to exercise its discretion by\nnot deporting Agnes who , like Fung-yuen , is not responsible for her\npredicament and should not be punished . \n\n \n\nThe judges also mulled over the morals of the question and\nmitigating factors before reaching two opposite decisions on letting the boy\nstay while asking the girl to leave .\n\n\nNo two cases are exactly alike .\n\n\nExemptions for Fung-yuen and Agnes do not mean automatic waivers for\nothers .\n\n\nI applaud the Government for heeding the views of the public , and\ndeclaring that the cases of Fung-yuen and Agnes are exceptional and do not\nmean any change to its current immigration policy and right-of-abode criteria .\n\n\n \n\nWe live in a flawed world in which not everyone gets the breaks\nhe or she deserves .\n\n\nBut Agnes and Fung-yuen are no longer statistics .\n\n\nThe girl and the boy are bonded to Hong Kong and it would be wrong to\ndeprive either their opportunity to grow up in their city and among people\nwho evidently cherish them .\n\n\nSometimes in life all we can do is make not a major impact , but a\nsmall difference as our conscience dictates and as humanity requires .\n\n\nHong Kong is Agnes and Fung-yuen  ' s home .\n\n\nOthers in the same situation might not be so lucky because there is a\nlimit to tolerance and there is also the law . \n\n \n\n James Tien Pei-chun is chairman of the Liberal Party \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n End prejudice or lose our main lifeline   \n\n\n Party Politics   \n\n\nJames Tien \n\n \n\n ALTHOUGH THE  Legislative Council is often divided\n, in May it passed - with a large majority - a Liberal Party motion to ease\nthe way for more mainland visitors and investors to come to Hong Kong .\n\n\nThe Hong Kong Tourism Board , to its credit , promptly asked to have\nthe daily quota of 1,500 travellers from the mainland either scrapped or\nraised to 2,000 .\n\n\nThe latter will now happen , from September 1 . \n\n \n\nOn Friday , the Government then launched an &dollar;18 billion\nprogramme to beautify every district for tourism .\n\n\nFinancial Secretary Antony Leung Kam-chung last week went to Beijing\nto discuss with the central Government a range of issues , tourism and\ninvestment prominent among them .\n\n\nBoth sides are now ironing out the details on multiple-entry visas\nfor businessmen and reduced hassles for tourists . \n\n \n\nAll this is heartening .\n\n\nBut what is not is mainland tourist operators ' complaints that their\ncustomers are being ripped off or discriminated against in Hong Kong . \n\n \n\nThe abuse of visitors blackens our reputation , casts a shadow\nover our relations with the mainland and sabotages the expensive promotion of\nour \" City of Life\" .\n\n\nWhat counts is not the hospitality we pledge but the hospitality we\ndeliver .\n\n\nWe have to make word of mouth work for , rather than against , Hong\nKong . \n\n \n\nI am aggrieved but not surprised by the contempt some of our\npeople , not only merchants , show to our compatriots .\n\n\nWe all have a bank of memories about rude relatives from the \"\nhome &rdquo; villages , their uncouth manners and demands on our generosity ( \nalso known as \" obligations\" ) .\n\n\nWhile China has changed , bias , maybe even bigotry , has not as our\nChinese-language media , reflecting our own prejudices , continue to\ncaricature mainlanders as \" simpletons\" , \" hicks &rdquo; and\n\" bumpkins\" . \n\n \n\nStories circulating on the mainland about Hong Kong swindlers are\nperhaps exaggerated but these are nonetheless gaining credence by their\nrepetition .\n\n\nChastened visitors talk about surly clerks who reserve their smiles\nfor other customers; about having inferior goods fobbed on them for high\nprices; the switching of camera lenses; the passing-off of jewellery as pure\ngold when it isn't and other similar examples . \n\n \n\nThese cases , while isolated , portray Hong Kong as a grabbing ,\npushy place , a stereotype that some of our workers in the tourist trade have\ndone little to dispel . \n\n \n\nMorally , the mistreatment of visitors is repugnant and\novercharging is tantamount to fraud or theft .\n\n\nFinancially , this can be ruinous for Hong Kong because mainlanders\nare our most numerous patrons .\n\n\nBack in 1998 , when the mainland tourist boom began , some 2.7\nmillion of them visited , increasing to 3.2 million in 1999 , 3.8 million\nlast year and a projected four million this year .\n\n\nThey now constitute a third of our visitors and this portion could\nwell increase as mainland wealth rises . \n\n \n\nAnother factor which could increase the ratio of mainland\nvisitors is the recession , which might convince those from Europe , North\nAmerica , Australia , Japan and elsewhere in Asia to stay away . \n\n \n\nEconomically , our future hinges on prosperity in China , which\nis poised to join the World Trade Organisation later this year .\n\n\nWe are witnessing and benefiting from the emergence of a mainland\nmiddle class , which in the first six months of this year bought 345,000\nprivate cars , a 30.7 per cent rise from the same period last year .\n\n\nMainland investments , which have soared by more than 15 per cent in\nthe first half of this year , will sustain growth initially fuelled by\nforeign capital .\n\n\nMainland property sales rose by 28.2 per cent in contrast to the\nstagnant real estate market in Hong Kong . \n\n \n\nAs mainland Chinese live better and earn more , they aspire to\nexperience the world , both close to and far from home .\n\n\nThis wanderlust is reflected in the fact that the Chinese authorities\nregistered 450 billion yuan (  about HK&dollar;420 billion ) in domestic\ntourism and tourist-related revenue last year .\n\n\nOf this amount , Chinese people visiting other mainland sites\ngenerated 330 billion yuan . \n\n \n\nHong Kong nowadays is not unrivalled as a Chinese destination .\n\n\nIt must vie with the likes of Shanghai , Guangzhou and Beijing to\nattract more discerning mainland tourists . \n\n \n\nMany Chinese from the north are frustrated with the difficulties\nfacing them when it comes to visiting Hong Kong , where they are often\ntreated with suspicion .\n\n\nThey say it seems easier for them to jet to Los Angeles for Disney\ntheme parks than to cross the border into the SAR .\n\n\nSurveys among Chinese travellers place France and the United States\nas choice destinations , not Hong Kong .\n\n\nThroughout the region , countries are wooing mainland visitors who\nfind they are valued in places like Singapore , Thailand and Malaysia . \n\n \n\nNot only is Hong Kong sometimes unfriendly to mainland visitors ,\nit is also expensive .\n\n\nThe fare and other costs for a typical train trip to Hong Kong from\nnearby Guangdong province costs around &dollar;1,500 .\n\n\nThe same traveller can fly to Bangkok and stay for five days and\nnights at a hotel for a comparable amount during the off season .\n\n\nWe have to do more to bring in tourist business because we cannot\ncontinue to take for granted mainland patronage . \n\n \n\nOur Government can help our tourist trade compete for China  ' s\ncustom by lifting restrictions and waiving some fees but it cannot , on its\nown , change public attitudes manifest in the shoddy treatment of mainland\nvisitors . \n\n \n\nIn this respect , we can only help ourselves by according\ntravellers equal respect and by educating our youngsters not to discriminate .\n\n\nWe must open our hearts to our visitors , not only because we desire\ntheir patronage , but also because we are courteous and civil . \n\n \n\nWhat the Government can also do is to try even harder to entice\nmainland individuals to immigrate and invest in Hong Kong .\n\n\nTheir rental or purchase of office space , location of executives\nhere , and recruitment of our workers will boost our economy and forge a\nperfect partnership between the mainland , with its vast market , and the SAR\n, with its financial expertise and cosmopolitan flair . \n\n \n\n James Tien Pei-chun is chairman of the Liberal Party \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Humanities ` under threat if CATS proposal implemented'\n  \n\n\n HIGHER REVIEW   \n\n\n Hung Chang-tai  \n\n \n\nThe report on higher education in Hong Kong , issued by the\nUniversity Grants Committee , is the latest in a long line of\ngovernment-commissioned prescriptions for healing an ailing patient , with\none distinct difference: the report  ' s prognosis comes principally from a\nforeign physician . \n\n \n\nThe jury is still out on the Sutherland report , but it has\nalready generated heated debate among pundits and university administrators\non a number of issues , among them the controversial Credit Accumulation and\nTransfer System (  CATS ) . \n\n \n\nCATS permits students to enrol in courses away from their home\ninstitutions , with the latter being subsidised for each additional student\nadmitted under the scheme .\n\n\nThis system , advocates insist , would allow students a greater\ndegree of academic choice and enhances flexibility in learning .\n\n\nWho can dispute the value of heightened choice and flexibility , two\ncardinal principles of academic freedom , indeed the foundation of modern-\nday higher education ? \n\n \n\nHowever , as a detractor , I see at least two potential problems\nin this recommendation; too much freedom placed in the hands of students and\n, more importantly , the plan risks promoting an erroneous trend - the\ncommercialisation of higher education in Hong Kong . \n\n \n\nCurrently , universities lack structured and rigorous mechanisms\nto ensure the quality of their teaching .\n\n\nDifferent institutions operate in various ways , each with distinct\nstandards for measuring excellence .\n\n\nIn my view , local universities , whether in principle or in\npractice , possess neither a core curriculum nor distribution requirements\nthat ensure students a comprehensive education .\n\n\nAs a result , course offerings are fragmented and unco-ordinated .\n\n\nWhile CATS encourages selection , it offers undergraduates too much\nfreedom of choice without providing appropriate guidance for achieving a\nbalanced education . \n\n \n\nAnother problematic aspect of CATS is the subsidising of\ninstitutions based on their number of \" outside students\" .\n\n\nAt a time of drastic budget cuts , a decrease in government funding\nand few private endowments available , the tuition of every student counts .\n\n\nHence the increasing danger of institutions being tempted to offer\n\" soft courses &rdquo; and hand out high grades in order to draw more\noutside students . \n\n \n\nSoon local universities will be competing for more and more\nstudents and higher education will become a consumer market eager to please\nits valuable student customers .\n\n\nSuch a scenario runs counter to the very core of current educational\nreform . \n\n \n\nCATS also spells trouble for \" unpopular &rdquo; courses ,\nespecially in the humanities .\n\n\nThe study of literature , history and philosophy have long been\nerroneously perceived as an exercise in folly , for , in an age of advanced\nscientific and cyberspace technology , such endeavours are deemed \"\nimpractical &rdquo; and \" useless\" .\n\n\nThe humanities apparently no longer matter , especially in Hong Kong\n, where value is defined by the dollar sign .\n\n\nSadly , we live in a world that dismisses cultural values while\nconsumerism runs amok .\n\n\nThe proposed CATS may encourage students to take courses deemed\n\" fashionable &rdquo; and \" practical\" , thus further commercialising\nhigher education in line with market needs . \n\n \n\nThis misguided effort points to the root cause of our current\neducation woes: promoting students ' trendy disciplines and narrowly\nspecialised knowledge that cater to a profit-maximising , consumer-glutted\nsociety .\n\n\nIn the classroom , we are often frequently appalled by our students'\ndeclining language skills , lack of general knowledge , obsession with grades\n, and , worse still , absence of intellectual curiosity and critical acumen .\n\n\n \n\nThis troubling situation is the result of a rigid educational\nsystem .\n\n\nOne possible remedy , I would argue , is a return to teaching the\nbasics; writing , communications and reasoning .\n\n\nThe time-honoured humanities surely offers a much-needed solution\nas well , for they teach students to speak articulately , to write coherently\nand to think analytically .\n\n\nMoreover , they remind students that a balanced university education\nis more than learning a profession or marketable skills; they must also\ninstil \" energies of mind &rdquo; that can steer technology and\neconomic development along a more humane path .\n\n\nThe goal of tertiary education is not just to get a better job but\nrather to help students find fulfilment in their lives as they navigate\nthrough an ever changing and unpredictable world . \n\n \n\nStudents ' propensity to take only \" fashionable &rdquo;\ncourses , such as marketing , may serve them in the practical world but it\nwill not make them well-educated individuals .\n\n\nImplementing the CATS proposal risks the spread of shallow\nvocationalism and the promotion of consumer-driven learning .\n\n\nIf this system is adopted without simultaneously introducing\nmechanisms of quality control and , more importantly , a balanced curriculum\n, the prognosis for our students is grim indeed . \n\n \n\n Hung Chang-tai is

{"text": "Peter Maxwell Davies was born on 1934 .\n\n\nHe is a English composer .\n\n\nDuring his time , he had a great achievement on the music drama .\n\n\nEspecially on the parody .\n\n\n With his successfully on parody , it makes\nthe music drama  opening a new pages .\n\n\nAnd in the following we will have on his theatre \" Eight songs\nfor a mad king &rdquo; to see how he uses  with the  parody \nand the great achievement in Music drama . \n \n\nFirstly , we must need to understand what is the meaning of\n\" Parody &rdquo; .\n\n\nBy Michael Tilmouth , he defined that compositional techniques use\nwith the  pre-existent material .\n\n\n And in Maxwell Davies opera he has used with the\nmaterial from medieval to   contemporary  music\nfor examples : Bach , Mozart .\n\n\nBesides , the other meaning of parody  is to make fun\nor humor by mocking with the  pre-existent materials\n, for examples: Lully's opera , Mozart's \" magic flute &rdquo; and\nBritten \" A midsummer night's Dream. &rdquo; \n \n\nAnd Davies also says that , he uses parody that is to  makes collections with the other composers so he also\n defined his work is \" stage props &rdquo;\n\n\nBesides ,    since  it  collected with many\ncenturies works , so the work also is the collective source from medieval to\n  contemporary  . \n \n\nNow , let us go to see how Davies uses with parody on the \"\nEight Songs for a mad King. &rdquo; \n \n\n\" Eight Songs for a mad king &rdquo; use with vocal ,\npercussion , violin , keyboard , cello , flute , piccolo and clarinet .\n\n\nIt is a eight poems by   Randolph  Stow .\n\n\nThe story is about a mechanical  organ which has\neight tones and it belongs to the King George III to teach the mechanical\nbird to sing . \n \n\nThe singer appears in costume and the instrumentalist , violin ,\nflute , clarinet and cello also .\n\n\nAnd they played in a birdcages which role as the king's birds .\n\n\nAnd the   percussionist  role as the\nking's keeper . \n \n\nThe first quotation is in Section B of the first song \"\nSentry &rdquo; .\n\n\n   When the harpsichord plays the word\n\" Kingdom &rdquo; , it is quotate from Handel \" Messiash &rdquo; .\n\n\nLater , in Section C , the left hand rhythm is  is accompaniment of the \"   Messiah \n\" .\n\n\nIt is very important for Davies to use this because in the   contemporary  period , music mostly is avant garde\nor atonal .\n\n\nBut he quotates Handel music , then it can <unc>  </unc> attract  the listener . \n \n\nAnd in section K to L , there is a dancing melody and the music\nis a  England  folk music of the\nmedieval period . \n \n\nIn section O of the fourth song \" To be sung on the water\n&rdquo; , the bass melody \" Flow burned my people &rdquo; play by the\ncello is a parody of the melancholy mood of Bartok music and it also full\nwith Hungarian Folk mood . \n \n\nFurthermore in the fifth Song \"   \nPhantom   Queen &rdquo; there are three bars which  abel with \" Rondino &rdquo; and right hand melody is accented\nwith accidentals &rdquo; this a parody of the classical keyboard music .\n\n\nBesides , the melody and the harmony are play in different key , and\nit is called the out-off-tone .\n\n\ntechnique .\n\n\nAnd there are many Baroque suite can  be\nfound .\n\n\nThe Arietta &rdquo; accompanied by <unc>  </unc> the flute and clarinet is a  style of the 18th century aria .\n\n\nThe theme is  distorted by the time 15-8 and\n quintuple .\n\n\n And then follows by a \" Allemende &rdquo; and\n\" Courante. &rdquo;\n\n\nThis is a parody of the Baroque suite . \n \n\nLater , in the sixth song \" The Counterfeit &rdquo; there\nis a melody to sing \" if you tell me a lie &rdquo; and  the singer is asked to sing in \" Italian tenor &rdquo; by the\ncomposer .\n\n\nAnd  actually this a  flamenco style of the spanish singing . \n \n\nAnd in the seventh songs \" The country Dance &rdquo; As the\nbeginning it   labels  with \" Scotch Bonnet\n&rdquo; it is a Scottish folk dance accompanied by pop music .\n\n\nAnd secondary dominant  and    syncopation   are also heard .\n\n\nSo it  is the style of Ragtime . \n \n\nAfter the rag time , there is a parody of Handel again .\n\n\n\" Comfort Ye &rdquo; sings by a female voice .\n\n\nAnd then it go to a part called the   foxtrot \n, which use again the Scotch Dance music , but now with vocal and accompanied\nline , but the singer need to sing in speaking voice and it calls   foxtrot  which is popular in American ballroom . \n \n\nAnd later in the last part of the 7th song , another \"\n\" comfort Ye &rdquo; \" appears again , but it is different\nfrom the previous .\n\n\n The singers needs to sing in falsetto\nscreaming  which is a singing technique  ie  the\ntenor sing an octave high   than  his    ordinary  pitch .\n\n\nAs a result it becomes weaker and this very popular in England . \n \n\nAnd in the last song , the king \"  \nhowling  \" and the   percussionist \nplay the  bass drum with him until the king off-stage .\n\n\nAnd this is very common use in \nShakespearians music . \n \n\nFrom the above we can see Davies is interesting on parody and he\nalso  uses with   successful  .\n\n \n\nBesides , parody , there is another technique he had used in his\ndrama .\n\n\nFirstly is the word painting .\n\n\nIn the first song , there is a \" snakes &rdquo; shape appear .\n\n\nThe tone draws from high to low and to make a snakes \n  movement   .\n\n\nBesides in the \" The country walking \" when The singer is\nneed to sing a melody \" Child , child whose son are you &rdquo; .\n\n\nThe composer ask to sing \" Like a child &rdquo; .\n\n\n \n \n\nAnd in the \" The counterfeit &rdquo; there is a melody\n\" Dear , land the sheep , the    word sheep\n\" - \" ee &rdquo; \" is nasal so  when the\nsinger sing it , it is very like a sheep . \n \n\nBesides , Davies also used with dramatic elements .\n\n\nFor example ,  when the \nviolinist finishes his playing the king   \ngrab  the violin and smashed into pieces and as a result he became mad\nand    howling  off the\nstage . \n \n\nFurthermore , the drama also have historical Character .\n\n\n\n\n\nFirstly , the story is also the  King George\nIII and in the 6th song \" the counterfeit &rdquo;  the\nking said  \" I am not nervous &rdquo; and I am not ill\" \nare the  sentence he said before . \n \n\nAnd in the drama , Davies also uses with   \narchaic   notation .\n\n\nFor examples , the Clef for the cello he use  and\n in  the\nmedieval period , the sharp is put above the note and Davies also use it .\n\n\nHowever he also uses with \nsome notation which innovated by  himself for\nexample for the chord  and for breath  they are\nthe notation innovated by Davies . \n \n\nAnd in the \" Eight songs  for a mad King.\n&rdquo; Davies also uses with  many England music and  techniques , for example , Handel \" Messiah, &rdquo; England\nfolk dance music the classical style of England and the  \nScotch    Bonnet  ,  since he\nis nationalist . \n \n\nAnd from the \" Eight songs for a mad King &rdquo; we can\nsee that the great achievement which Davies had done is music drama , is that\n,  he <unc> \n</unc> makes the content of music drama  more  colourful .\n\n\nHe  opens a new road to collect  music material .\n\n\nIn his drama we see it is a component of the medieval , the popular\nand the   contemporary  .\n\n\n He use the medieval material\nsuch as the notation ,  the Rondino , Arietta , Allemende ,\nCourante .\n\n\nThe popular material such as the ragtimes ,  \nfoxtrot  ,   Scotch  Dance and also with his new\ninnovation of music . \n \n\nIn conclusion , Maxwell Davies is a great composer in music drama .\n\n\nsince his uses of parody and use the material from medieval to   contemporary  , it makes the drama music in the 20th\n  contemporary   \n becomes more interesting and  lively .\n\n\nAnd the other composer also affected by him and go to use parody in\ntheir drama .  \n\n\n10 \n \n\n\n\n\nBritish opera , in the twentieth century have a climax of development\nunder Britain and  Tippett British opera after Purcell\nis  in bad   situation  .\n\n\nthe Italian opera controlled the England Stage .\n\n\nAlthough some British composer have do something to improve such as\nWagner  . \n \n\nBut it cannot go to the climax .\n\n\nBut when   Britten  and  Tippett have a great deal\nof work on opera the situation is change   immediately\n . \n \n\nOpera is sensitive with the political , economic and social\nsituation .\n\n\nAnd it also reflected the  mood of the individual\nand community .\n\n\n After\nthe WWII , world depression arising , as a result , the development of the\nopera also be affected .\n\n\nHowever ,  at the same time , many opera\ncomposer such a   Britten  and Tippett realized that it also a  chance to develop the opera .\n\n\nBut it must use with the classical techniques and experiment with a\nnewer music style to open the new page of British opera . \n \n\nBesides ,   \ntechnologically  , radio ,  television and\n long-term used record is developed .\n\n\nAs a result it can help to developed the Opera . \n  \n \n\nIf we want to know the development of the opera I think we must\nlook through the harmony , text , form , the use of orchestra and aria and\nchorus to see how the British opera developed in twentieth century . \n \n\nAs I have say , the composer realized that only with the  classical and romantic \ntechnique and experiment and a newer music mean can develop the opera .\n\n\nSo ,  many of the text  of the\nopera are from the old story .\n\n\n Especially from Shakesperian .\n\n\nFor example , in   Britten  opera's A Midsummer Night's Dream and\nTippett's Midsummer Marriages &rdquo; are the subject from Shakesperian .\n\n\nThe   Midsummer  Night's Dream .\n\n\nBesides , Tippett's The knot Garden also from Shakesperian's \"\nAll wells that end wells. &rdquo; \n \n\nBesides  the also deal with the   contrast  between the collective activities and the loneliness\nand misery of   discontented  individual e.g .\n\n\nPeter Grimes .\n\n\n And also the   personal\n relationship in the world .\n\n\nSo , we can see that the  British opera now become\nmore humanity , not only reflects the king or Queen . \n \n\nAnd , in the   harmony  , the development\nis the mostly use with tonality .\n\n\n( ie . with Center key ) .\n\n\nBesides also use with the Aeolian Dolian and Phygian mode for the\n  harmony  .\n\n\nAnd modulation is also fully used .\n\n\nHowever , the techniques of the 20th century such as the atonality ,\nBitonality , <unc>  </unc> are also used .\n\n\nAnd in Britten opera's one technique he has <unc>  </unc> used is interesting ie  \nreconcile  the hostile key by enharmonic mean .\n\n\n In the Peter Grimes , the last Prologue ,\nPeter and Ellen first meet and sing in the F minor and E major .\n\n\nHowever , later , Peter sing in A flat and G sharp and as a result\nthey sing in the unison . \n \n\nOn the other hand , the using of orchestra is   developed  .\n\n\nThe orchestra is used not only for colour but also for character ,\n mood  and for    symbolization   .\n\n\nFor example , Tippett want to perform a \nmagic mood , he uses with , Flute,  clesta  .\n\n\nIn the Curlew River , the  flute is\nthe cause and the expression of the madwoman . \n \n\n \nthe form of the 20th centuries British opera is mainly the form of the\nclassical form .\n\n\nThey are the Rondo , ABACA or ABAB with a coda , the binary form AB\nand    ternary  Form ABC . \n \n\nMoreover , the aria and chorus is also with the old style .\n\n\nthe opera is  divided in many Act and the\nact also subdivided into many scenes .\n\n\nAnd there are many numbers of arias for  expression .\n\n\nAnd the chorus <unc>  </unc> also used\nfor commendation on the action . \n \n\nIn conclusion ,  the British operas\nin the 20th centuries have a great development .\n\n\nAnd the development is based on the classical techniques and   experiment  with a newer kind of music .\n\n\nEspecially under Britain and  Tippett the two\ngreatest opera composers in Britain help to  pull the\nBritish opera to a <unc>  </unc> climax .\n\n\nAnd develops a new kind of British opera .  \n\n\n4 \n \n\nDuring the twentieth centuries , the musical atmosphere have a\ngreat change .\n\n\nMany composers go to use with atonal , serialism  and other new innovation to compose their work . \n \n\n However , some composers still to\ncompose the classical work , they go back to the history .\n\n\nAnd so  in the following , I choose   Lutoslavski  , the    Liverpool \n   orchestra  and  \nShostakovich's  15 symphony to have a comparison . \n \n\n  Lutoslavski  is an avant garde of\nthe 20th century .\n\n\n He is a  poland's\ncomposer .\n\n\nAnd   Shostakovitch  also is a composer\nof 20th century , he also use the atonal and serialism to compose but his\nlate symphony is much classical , so I chose for comparison .\n\n\nHe is a Russian composer . \n \n\n Both the\nsymphonies are in four  movement .\n\n\nFor  Shotackovich   Shostakovitch\n , they are ( 1 ) Allegretto ( 2 ) Adagio\n( 3 ) Allegretto ( 4 ) Adagio .\n\n\nAnd to   Lutoslavski's   symphony .\n\n\nit also have 4 movements which he called the 4 chapter .\n\n\nBut between each chapter there is a interlude .  \n \n\nAnd the size of the  orchestra of the both\nsymphonies are in normal size .\n\n\nBut   \nShostakovitch  emphasis on the percussion part .\n\n\nHe use the percussion to make the climax . \n \n\nOn the other hand , metrical signatures are changed rapidly in\nboth symphonies .\n\n\nBesides , they both use with new metre such as 7/8 , 5/4 . \n \n\n And the shape of rhythm of both symphonies\nhave some different .\n\n\n  Lutoslavski  like to use  such   rhythm  to make a\nclimax . \n\n\nBut to   Shostakovitch  the rhythm is\n stable . \n \n\nBesides in   Shostakovitch's \nsymphony , he like to use with quotation .\n\n\n For example , quotation for wagner and\nBeethoven . \n \n\nOn the other hand , the harmony they used are different .\n\n\nSince Lutoslawki is  an avant garde , the harmony\nhe uses with is also  different .\n\n\nFor example ,  the harmony line he  uses is not horizontal , on the other hand ,\nit is vertical .\n\n\nBesides he also  innovented some chord eg .\n42424 5353  and also they are group\nby their interval .\n\n\nAnd he also likes to use with dissonance .\n\n\nAnd because the characteristic of his  \n work is from tense to relax so he use of dissonance to make the tension .\n\n \n\nAnd   Shostakovitch  also use with\ndissonance in his work .\n\n\n<unc>  </unc> And also use\nwith modality in the symphony . \n \n\nFurthermore , in   Lutoslavski's \nsymphony , compare with   Shostakovitch  , there\nis many new notation .\n\n\nAnd many of the notation and invented by  \nLutoslavski  eg . \n\n\nHowever every notation also has the  \nexplanation  by the composer . \n \n\nAnd , the other character of  \nLutoslavski's  symphony is that he give the freedom of conduction and\nperforming between the conductor and performer .\n\n\nHis uses  ad libitum  for them to  perform themselves . \n \n\nOn the other hand , the form of  \nShostakovitch  15 symphony is based on sonata form .\n\n\nBut to   Lutoslavski  it is the  close form which he developed . \n  \n \n\nBesides , in   Lutoslavski's \nsymphony , he also use with serialism which  \nShostakovitch's  in his symphony seldom use .\n\n\n  Shostakovitch  likes to use with the\ntonality . \n \n\nIn conclusion , both the composers are the greatest composers of\nthe 20th centuries .\n\n\nHowever to a certain extent , they both have different contribution .\n\n\nFor   Lutoslavski  , he established the\ncommunication between the  conductor and the listener .\n\n\nAnd  for   Shostakovitch \nhe  can recall the classical technique of composition in\nthe 20th centuries

{"text": "A BIT OF LUCK \n\n \n\nMy wife and I were waiting for the bus in Canberra one Saturday\nafternoon .\n\n\nIt was a sunny day in winter and we were on holiday .\n\n\nSoon I noticed that a woman sitting next to us was attempting\neye-contact and was on the verge of a smile .\n\n\nThe clement weather brings out the sociable in people , I suppose .\n\n\nBeautiful day , I said .\n\n\nIt transpired that she managed to buy the handbag she was cuddling at\na very low price that morning .\n\n\nIt was the only one left , and she was clearly very please with\nherself .\n\n\nThe bag was ghastly , faded plastic and lopsided .\n\n\nThat was lucky of you , put in my wife trying to say something nice .\n\n\nShe smile , drew on here cigarette and said , one always needs a bit\nof luck in the world. \n\n \n\nMildly eccentric .\n\n\nBut that wasn't it , there was something inexplicable about her .\n\n\nShe was clearly older than she seemed , she also had a battered look\nabout her , also there was an underlying bubbliness which was almost manic .\n\n\nShe chatted on merrily in her very German voice occasionally\nflattened by the Australian vowel .\n\n\nAt one point her sleeve fell back and there was a number etched on\nher forearm .\n\n\nWe tried not to react .\n\n\nShe smiled and explained that she was Aryan , not Jewish , she was\nthrown into the camps because she was a communist , but she managed to escape\nand came to Australia as a refugee .\n\n\nThat was a long time ago , a long time ago , she said , reassuringly .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMother had just turned seventy , but her hair has gone white a\nlong time ago .\n\n\nThere she stands , her shock of white hair blending in its outer\nedges with the light of the sun , together they shine like a halo .\n\n\nHer white tunic gleams down the middle where her bright green mantle\nparts at the front .\n\n\nIt looks more like an ecclesiastical cope than a mantle .\n\n\nIt drapes , it falls into place , it flows , it plies and bends with\nthe movements of her body , it sweeps the grass , then it sweeps her body .\n\n\nShe continues on her way , effortlessly , lightly , as if the cape\ngrows from her very body .\n\n\nShe is one with this magnificent green that seems to shine with an\ninner light , that seems to glisten like rows and rows of tiny sequins and\nyet its edges glide over the grass as naturally as if it belongs there. \n\n \n\nThe light from behind her head prevents me from seeing her face\nclearly .\n\n\nIt seems transfused with light .\n\n\nI crouch into the grass , as if mesmerised .\n\n\nShe keeps approaching where I am without seeming to get very much\ncloser. \n\n \n\nAh yes , she does come closer now , at long last .\n\n\nNow I begin to see her face clearly . \n\n \n\nHer black eyes penetrated or so I felt .\n\n\nI breathed a sigh of relief .\n\n\nMy body sagged , almost sobbing , into a state of complete and utter\nabandon .\n\n\nIt felt like coming home . \n\n \n\nTen minutes ago , still crouching in the grass , I felt a sharp\npiercing bite .\n\n\nI started in pain .\n\n\nI then saw a bright green bamboo snake winding its way in big loops\nover the grass , its scales shimmering in the sun .\n\n\nThe green bamboo snake is registered as one of the most venomous\nsnakes in the land .\n\n\nHelp is out of the question .\n\n\nThis is the wilderness and there is no one within reach. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThere is a black hole at the back of my head which stretches into\ninfinity .\n\n\nIt is always there , blatantly or latently .\n\n\nIt is there during my waking hours , whether I  ' m walking or sitting\ndown , working or idling .\n\n\nIt is sometimes felt as a lump inside me , sometimes in the throat .\n\n\nSometimes it causes contraction in the chest , then I would have to\ninhale deeply in an attempt to relieve the difficult breathing and to send\nthe choking feeling as far as possible back to where it belongs .\n\n\nThat is , I suppose , referred sensation , not unlike referred pain .\n\n\n \n\nOn wintry days I would see it at a great distance , especially\nwhen I close my eyes .\n\n\nAs I begin to get used to the dark , it starts to grow , slowly ,\nbigger and bigger , until it gets so big , I find myself in it . \n\n \n\nIt has a tremendous force .\n\n\nAnything within a certain periphery is lost to its firm , steady ,\ninexorable pull .\n\n\nIt enfolds you and you become nothing .\n\n\nAll my life , in varying degrees , I  ' ve had to fight off that force .\n\n\nConstantly afraid that it would swallow me up , I keep my eyes\nbulgingly open , on the qui vive all the time .\n\n\nWhen I reach exhaustion , I drop off for a moment , only to wake up\nwith a start and a jerk , fearing for my life . \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe hind-wheel of a double-decker bus wound in a body , squashed\nit for a quarter of a mile before the driver knew what had happened and\nstopped .\n\n\nLater , the Medical and Health Department had to go back on that\nquarter mile to pick up the flattened bits .\n\n\nThis sort of thing doesn't happen very often .\n\n\nNormally , people only get dragged along because the driver doesn't\nstop long enough for passengers to get off .\n\n\nSometimes , heads get a bit fractured or a little broken , at other\ntimes , limbs get trapped or truncated , fingers get subtracted perhaps , but\npeople don't die that easily . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n WHAT MOTHER TAUGHT ME \n\n \n\nI spent the first seven years of my life trying very hard to\nlearn how not to live .\n\n\nFor I have heard mother say that it was better to be dead than to be\nalive .\n\n\nI did not know then that it was only a matter of speaking , that it\nwas her way of controlling others .\n\n\nI tried everything and failed .\n\n\nI tried anorexia nervosa , I tried insomnia , I tried constipation ,\nI tried all sorts of illness and was sometimes hospitalised , but failed to\nstop myself from being alive .\n\n\nThen from aged seven onwards I learnt how not to live even with\nstaying alive .\n\n\nNow this was easier .\n\n\nI became so good at it I could slip in and out of non-living very\neasily .\n\n\nThe stasis of non-living is beyond time , beyond wear and tear ,\nbeyond means and meaning . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n THREE MEN IN A LIFT , NOT TO MENTION THE WOAMN WHO DIDN'T GET IN\n\n\n \n\nIt was a University function held at the Art Centre on the\nIsland .\n\n\nThe Arts Centre is a fifteen-minute walk away from the city centre ,\nwhat the locals call prime-land .\n\n\nThis was for some years the most costly piece of land in the world ,\nit is now the third most costly , after Tokyo and London .\n\n\nThe city , represented by the Urban Council , had been hankering\nafter such a centre for decades , neither private nor public sector paid any\nattention , the arts being hardly a lucrative activity .\n\n\nIt was finally built because some clever bureaucrat detected an\nangle of space in between two high-rise buildings which could be made into a\ntriangle .\n\n\nAt least it would be a variation on going round and round in circles .\n\n\nIt is aesthetically interesting too .\n\n\nIt  ' s like fitting a neat compact Pompidou Centre of a box in\nbetween the legs of a sleeping giant .\n\n\nAnd so the New University had seen fit to mix and mingle with the\nsuave urbanites in their environment instead of holding the reception out in\nthe wilds of the country-side campus . \n\n \n\nGuest and university personnel alike were arriving in hordes ,\njamming the triangular lobby , waiting to take the lifts that would take them\nto higher triangles .\n\n\nMen in dark suits , women dripping in jewels and finery jostled\nabout elbowing their way everywhere .\n\n\nThis was twenty-first century civilisation where a dissociation of\nfinery from fine manners had firmly set in . \n\n \n\nBringing up the rear , about a lift-load away , was a group of\nfour trying to make conversation and visibly straining .\n\n\nI was later to learn that the three men were high-ranking\nadministrator in a university run by administrators and the woman only an\nacademic , and a junior one to boot .\n\n\nThe unspoken rationale was that any academic who rose high enough in\nthe ranks would become an administrator .\n\n\nIndeed , the administration was the university .\n\n\nAcademics were incidental additions as somehow courses had to be\noffered and students had to be taught .\n\n\nThe young-looking man on the left was Petronius Ong , recently\nHarvard Phd  ' d and positively glowing , now dean of students in one of the\ncolleges .\n\n\nThe one on the right was Aloysius Jing , just returned from\nCambridge , U.K. , full of praise for \" the civilised manners of the\nEnglish\" .\n\n\nThe man in the middle was T.S. Tan , president of one of the colleges , who refers to Lord Todd by\nhis first name , etc.  etc . \n\n \n\nThe lift arrived .\n\n\nPeople got out .\n\n\nPeople got in .\n\n\nAs the four neared the lift entrance , it became clear there was\nonly room for three .\n\n\nAs if caught in mid-sentence , for a split second facial muscles\ntensed up and the four shared a blank look .\n\n\nNo one actually made a mad dash , they just straightened their\nbacks and looked vague . \n\n \n\nThen everything happened very quickly .\n\n\nThe three men moved towards the lift and just as they did so , the\nwoman took one big deliberate step backwards .\n\n\nIt was at this point that she caught my eye and we burst out\nlaughing . \n\n \n\nShe came up to me as I leant against the counter and explained\nthat that was perhaps the refugee spirit which was so infectious in this\ncolony .\n\n\nThree presumably civilised men couldn't resist getting into a lift\nas if it was the last lift available , the last meal , the last boat , the\nlast chance .\n\n\nYou  ' re a journalist , she called to me as she was about to board\nan empty lift , write about it , make someone laugh! \n\n \n\nThere was a last gesture that struck me as interesting .\n\n\nI wonder if she noticed , perhaps women don't .\n\n\nThat tableau of the lift doors about to close , the three men were\nstanding in a straight line , all three of them held their hands together in\nfront of their trousers , as if protecting themselves .\n\n\nI know , a lot of nonsense has been made of Hitler and his\nhands-over-his-crotch pose .\n\n\nHowever , can there really be some truth in man  ' s fear of missing\nout on a lift ?\n\n\nI  ' ll be damned if I  ' m going to find out ! \n\n\n\n \n\n\n THERE ARE NO MONKEYS HERE \n\n \n\nThere are no monkeys here .\n\n\nThe Water Tower University is spread over several hill-tops and\nplenty of greenery , but there are no monkeys .\n\n\nOver the mountains to he south side of Sann Tien , near the\nreservoir , is a sheltered valley where monkeys live and breed; but that is\nanother place with another story  . \n\n \n\nOn the evening of the fifth of July , something strange took\nplace in the undergrowth near residence Number Nine on the campus .\n\n\nIn the midst of the commotion , a monkey shot out with blood on its\nmouth .\n\n\nThe followed the shrieks of a female voice interspersed with the\ncalling of \" Jake , Jake &rdquo; in the most heart-rending\ndesperation . \n\n \n\nJake came to the Department of Commercial Studies three years\nago .\n\n\nIt was one of those fashionable departments that kept redefining\nitself .\n\n\nNo one in the department knew what it was doing , not did anyone\nelse in the University .\n\n\nJake , burly New York Russian Jew , with more than the usual iron\nin the blood , came , and saw the opportunity amidst the chaos . \n\n \n\nHe soon became the head of department . \n\n \n\nSometime in the past , he had worked as a bouncer in various\nnight-clubs in New York and Paris .\n\n\nThe University did not know about this , but they must have\nrecognised the  je ne sais quoi  in him , since what they\nwanted was indeed a bouncer for the department . \n\n \n\nAs for Jake , it was a good salary , there was additional perks\n, and the campus provided from time to time diversion in the form of\nabout-to-divorce wives looking for novel perch , any kind of perch . \n\n \n\nOne such was Mrs . Brentshaum , the wife of the Professor of\nMorbid Anatomy in the newly founded and much publicised Medical School .\n\n\nShe had been contemplating divorce before she came with her husband .\n\n\nShe came anyway because the Far East was exotic .\n\n\nJake was in the process of divorcing his Catholic wife , but she\ndid not come over with him , even though the Far East was exotic . \n\n \n\nMrs. Brentshaum and Jake made love often and well , to the\ncomplete satisfaction of both . \n\n \n\nAll was going very well until Jake fell in love with a pretty\nyoung girl  .\n\n \n\nThe last time he had anything to do with Mrs. Brentshaum was\nthe Christmas of two years ago , when , for reasons unfathomable to the\noutside , Jake gave her a monkey for Christmas . \n\n \n\nWhatever symbiosis may or may not have grown between animal and\nmistress is anybody  ' s guess .\n\n\nOccasionally , she was seen carrying the monkey like a nursing\nchild , walking about the campus with the animal  ' s arms around her neck or\nbodice . \n\n \n\nAfter some months , Mrs . Brentshaum left the University and\nreturned to Florida .\n\n\nNothing was heard of her since . \n\n \n\nThe pretty young girl was taut as a stallion , at the same time\n, soft as many bags of down .\n\n\nApparently , Jake had , in private , expressed great joy in her\nwonderful breasts .\n\n\nThey were firm and shaped to perfection .\n\n\nAbove all , he said , they were topped with a pair of the most\nluscious pink nipples . \n\n \n\nOn that most deplorable of days , on the fifth of July , alas\nthe day , it all happened then  .\n\n \n\nAfter the evening of the fifth of July , the poor girl was left\nwas only one luscious nipple . \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nIt  ' s been snowing heavily and streets with cars and other\nthings are completely covered with snow .\n\n\nFunny , snow always (  especially at two in the morning ) gives a\nsense of permanence , unchangingness .\n\n\nIt arrests time and tings stay .\n\n\nLike a flood it covers all and swamps all but unlike a flood it\nmoves nothing and is in itself unmoving .\n\n\nIt reminds me of a Japanese sand garden with patterns raked into\nthe sand .\n\n\nIt stays for as long as you leave it , then you flatten it and rake\nup a new pattern .\n\n\nCars come and make furrows in the snow , these stay until other\ncars make other furrows . \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nFor every mask that we take off there is always one more left\non - an endless recession of masks , of depths of withdrawal .\n\n\nAs long as there is life , there is the ability to recede further .\n\n\nThe self is infinitely reductive and is never reduced to nothing .\n\n\nAlternatively , one can reach one and touch infinitely into the\nother person , the other thing , the outside , and having always to reach yet\nfurther  . \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nUnschooled in human relationships , all passions are registered\nby their intensities alone .\n\n\nThe elation of love towards a woman , a man , a chair , a dog\namounts to the same velocity and the resulting excitement will dissipate in\nthe same way .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "13e26d74-0b24-4673-8fa0-b86b8a293977", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.077856+00:00"}
{"text": "Leukocytes in blood transfusion: adverse effects and their prevention\n  \n\n\nRW Chu \n\n \n\n\nLeukocyte contamination during blood transfusion can cause many\nadverse effects , such as the transmission of cell-associated infectious\nagents , fibrile non-hameolytic reactions , graft-versus-host disease , and\nimmunosuppression .\n\n\nWhile using leukodepleted blood components can minimise some of these\nadverse effects , the leukodepletion of all cellular blood components is\ncostly .\n\n\nA more cost-effective alternative would be to supply leukodepleted\nblood components to at-risk patients only .    \n\n\nIntroduction  \n\n \n\nWhite blood cells or leukocytes are present in all cellular blood\ncomponents that are prepared by standard techniques .\n\n\nStudies have increasingly shown that leukocyte contamination of\nerythrocyte or platelet preparations can cause a wide variety of side effects\nafter their transfusion .\n\n\nExamples of adverse effects of leukocyte contamination are the\ntransmission of cell-associated infectious agents , febrile non-haemolytic\ntransfusion reactions , refractoriness to platelet transfusion ,\ngraft-versus-host disease , generalised immunosuppression , and an increased\ngraft rejection rate of marrow or kidney transplantations . \n\n \n\nThere are few benefits of retaining leukocytes in transfused\nblood products , except extending kidney transplant survival .\n\n\nAs a consequence , the use of leukodepleted blood components is\nwidely practised and recommended.  1 \n\n\nThe current trend in industrialised countries is that all cellular\nblood components to be transfused are leukodepleted .   \n\n\nAdverse effects of blood transfusion and their prevention by\nleukodepletion    )   \n\n\nTransmission of cell-associated infectious agents   \n \n\n\nCytomegalovirus transmission  \n\n \n\nCytomegalovirus (  CMV ) can be transmitted during the transfusion\nof cellular blood products and can cause significant morbidity and mortality\nin immuno-compromised CMV-seronegative pregnant women , premature infants ( \nbirthweight <1.2  kg ) born to CMV-seronegative women  , CMV-seronegative\nrecipients of all allogeneic bone marrow transplants from CMV-seronegative\ndonors , and CMV-seronegative patients with acquired immunodeficiency\nsyndrome.  1 \n\n\nTransfused erythrocytes , platelet concentrates , and granulocyte\nconcentrates have all been implicated as the cause of infection by\ntransfusion-transmitted CMV (  TT-CMV ) , while fresh frozen plasma and\ncryoprecipitate have not been reported to cause CMV transmission.  2\n\n\n\nThe cells that serve as reservoirs for CMV have not been identified ,\nbut monocytes have been considered to be the dominant cell-type that is\ninfected in peripheral blood.  3-6  \n\n \n\nThe use of CMV-seronegative blood products has been the  ' gold\nstandard ' method of preventing TT-CMV infection .\n\n\nEven so , they are still associated with a risk of TT-CMV of\napproximately 4%.  7 \n\n\nIt has recently been demonstrated that latent CMV in recipients'\nleukocytes can be reactivated from leukocytes of healthy seronegative blood\ndonors.  8 \n\n\nIn some of the CMV-seronegative individuals who harboured infectious\nCMV , a significant anti-CMV antibody response either may have diminished\nwith time or may have never been present.  8 \n\n\nThese possibilities could explain , at least in part , the residual\nrisk of TT-CMV following the transfusion of seronegative blood products .\n\n\nOn the other hand , some CMV-seropositive blood may not be\ninfectious .\n\n\nSince the prevalence of antibody to CMV ranges from 60% to\nmore than 90% , eliminating all CMV-seropositive donations to prevent\nTT-CMV would deplete the supply of blood available for transfusion .\n\n\nIn addition , as the CMV-seropositivity rate among Hong Kong\npopulation is more than 90% , obtaining CMV-seronegative blood or\nblood components may be difficult . \n\n \n\nStudies have found that depleting blood components of leukocytes\nis successful in preventing TT-CMV infection in neonates , patients with\nacute leukaemia , and bone marrow transplant recipients.  9-11 \n\n\nUsing leukodepleted blood components is thus an effective alternative\nmethod to using CMV-seronegative blood components to prevent TT-CMV infection\nto at-risk patients .   \n\n\nTransmission of other herpesviruses  \n\n \n\nBesides CMV , other herpesviruses such as Epstein-Barr virus ( \nEBV ) , human herpesvirus (  HHV)-6 , HHV-7 , and HHV-8 (  or Kaposi  ' s\nsarcoma-related herpesvirus (  KSHV ) ) are associated with leukocyte\ncontamination during transmission .\n\n\nPrimary EBV infections from blood transfusions may cause clinical\nproblems in EBV-seronegative transfusion recipients.  12 \n\n\nThus , in high-risk patients , leukocyte depletion to prevent primary\nEBV infection might be infected .\n\n\nThe clinical relevance of the transmission of HHV-6 , HHV-7 , and\nHHV-8/KSHV through blood transfusion is unclear and requires further\ninvestigation .   \n\n\nHuman T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma virus types I and II  \n\n \n\nHuman T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma virus (  HTLV ) types I and II\ntarget T lymphocytes and are solely transmitted by cellular blood components.\n 13 \n\n\nTransfusion-transmitted HTLV-I/II , however , is a very rare event\nand is even more rarely associated with progression to clinical disease .\n\n\nThe current strategy of limiting transfusion-transmitted HTLV-I/II is\nto serologically screen all donor blood .\n\n\nAs data are limited and no comparison exists , the Canadian\nCoordinating Office for Health Technology Assessment recently concluded that\n\" leukodepletion cannot currently be used as a substitute for HTLV-I\ntesting for this rare disease ...\"  14    \n\n\nBacterial contamination  \n\n \n\nThe rate of the bacterial contamination of platelet components is\nat least 10- to 100-times greater than the rate of contamination by many\nviruses (  human immunodeficiency virus (  HIV ) 1 or 2 , hepatitis B and C\nviruses , HTLV-I/II ) .\n\n\nStudies have shown that approximately one in every 1500 to one in\nevery 2000 units of platelets are contaminated with bacteria,  15,16\n although contamination does not always result in signs and symptoms of\nsepsis .\n\n\nLeukocyte depletion filters can directly and indirectly remove\nbacteria from platelet and erythrocyte preparations .\n\n\nBacteria adhere to the filter matrix , while phagocytic leukocytes ,\nwhich adhere to or ingest bacteria , are retained by the filters .\n\n\nHowever , the clinical efficacy of leukodepletion for bacterial\nremoval is not known .   \n\n\nTransmission of  Toxoplasma gondii   \n\n \n\nPrimary toxoplasmosis has been transmitted by whole-blood and\ngranulocyte transfusions and from the transplantation of organs from\nseropositive donors to immunocompromised recipients.  17 \n\n\n Toxoplasma gondii  can survive in refrigerated blood\ncomponents.  18 \n\n\nAs with other leukocyte-associated agents ,  T gondii \ntransmission can be minimised by transfusing leukocyte-depleted blood\ncomponents .\n\n\nSince the seroprevalence to the organism is high , however , most\ntransfusion recipients are not at risk .   \n\n\nTransmission of prions  \n\n \n\nPrions cause neurodegenerative disorders in both human and\nanimals , such as kuru , Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (  CJD ) , bovine spongiform\nencephalopathy , and the new-variant CJD (  nvCJD).  19 \n\n\nThe abnormal prion-related protein can be found in the tonsils and\nthe spleen of patients with nvCJD , but not in those with classical CJD .\n\n\nHence , circulating B lymphocytes might harbour the agent responsible\nfor the development of nvCJD.  20-24 \n\n\nHowever , no data are available on the likely transmissibility of CJD\nor nvCJD by blood transfusion .    \n\n\nFebrile non-haemolytic transfusion reactions   \n\n \n\nFebrile non-haemolytic transfusion reactions (  FNHTRs ) have been\nreported to occur with an incidence of 6.8% after erythrocyte\ntransfusion and 37.5% after platelet transfusion.  25 \n\n\nThe major cause of severe FNHTRs to erythrocytes is human leukocyte\nantigen (  HLA ) alloimmunisation .\n\n\nA reduction in the number of leukocytes to 5 x 10  8 \nleukocytes per unit of blood component is sufficient to prevent FNHTRs in\nmost cases .\n\n\nIt is generally agreed that patients requiring long-term red blood\ncell support (  eg those with beta thalassaemia major ) should receive\nerythrocyte concentrates in which leukocyte levels are below 5 x 10  8\n per unit to prevent FNHTRs.  26 \n\n\nThis level of leukodepletion can be achieved by the use of buffy\ncoat-depleted red blood cell concentrates or by transfusing red blood cells\nthrough bedside leukocyte filters .\n\n\nIf FNHTRs continue despite these measures , leukodepleted erythrocyte\nconcentrates that have a much lower level of leukocytes should be used . \n\n \n\nThere is increasing evidence that the major cause of FNHTRs after\nplatelet transfusion is due to the presence of pyrogenic cytokines ,\nespecially IL-1a , that are realized from leukocytes during the storage of\nplatelets at 22\u00b0C.  27 \n\n\nHence , FNHTRs following platelet transfusion are not reliably\nprevented by the bedside leukocyte filtration of platelet concentrates .\n\n\nIn contrast , performing leukodepletion before storage not only\nremoves the leukocytes , but can also markedly reduce the level of cytokines\nin platelet concentrates.  28  \n\n \n\nThe third mechanism of the onset of FNHTRs is relatively more\ncommon after the transfusion of platelets than after that of erythrocytes .\n\n\nThe adverse reaction is due to the formation of immune complexes of\nthe recipient  ' s antibodies with cells or proteins in the blood products ,\nwhich triggers the recipient  ' s immune system to release cytokines .\n\n\nLeukocyte depletion would therefore not prevent FNHTRs that occur due\nto this mechanism .    \n\n\nRefractoriness to platelet transfusion   \n\n \n\nPlatelet refractoriness is the repeated failure to obtain\nsatisfactory responses to platelet transfusion and is a common problem for\npatients receiving multiple transfusions .\n\n\nPlatelet refractoriness can arise due to immune or non-immune causes .\n\n\nNon-immune causes can include septicaemia , fever , disseminated\nintravascular coagulation , and splenomegaly .\n\n\nThe main immune cause is HLA alloimmunisation . \n\n \n\nThe development of an immune response to transfused platelet\ndepends on mainly on the interaction of the donor  ' s transfused\nantigen-presenting cells (  APCs ) with the recipient  ' s T cells , which then\nsignal the recipient  ' s B cells to produce alloantibodies .\n\n\nIt has been postulated that removing the donor  ' s leukocytes ( \nincluding APCs: mainly dendritic cells , monocytes , and B lymphocytes ) prior\nto transfusion may reduce the rates of platelet antigen alloimmunisation .\n\n\nThe accumulated data suggest that leukodepletion is relatively\neffective in preventing platelet antigen alloimmunisation among patients with\nacute myeloid leukaemia who are receiving induction chemotherapy.  29\n \n\n \n\nThe effectiveness of leukodepleted blood components in the\nprevention of HLA alloimmunisation among patients who may have been\nsensitised by previous transfusion or pregnancies is still controversial.\n 30 \n\n\nThere is also currently no convincing evidence that the routine\nleukodepletion of blood components produces clinical benefits for patients\nwho are receiving multiple platelet transfusions , although HLA\nalloimminisation and platelet refractoriness may be reduced.  1 \n   \n\n\nTransfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease   \n\n \n\nA rare but usually fatal complication of transfusion is\ntransfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (  TA-GVHD ) .\n\n\nThe risk associated with an individual transfusion depends on the\nnumber and viability of contaminating lymphocytes , the susceptibility of the\npatient  ' s immune system to their engraftment , and the degree of the\nimmunological (  HLA ) disparity between the donor and recipient .\n\n\nThe transfused variable T lymphocytes , under certain circumstances ,\nengraft and proliferate in the recipient .\n\n\nThe interaction between donor T lymphocytes and recipient cells\nbearing either class I or class II HLA antigens results in cellular damage ,\nwhich may be mediated by natural killer cells .\n\n\nMajor target tissues include skin , thymus , gastro-intestinal tract\n, liver , spleen , and bone marrow .\n\n\nThe risks of TA-GVHD are highest in recipients who have an\nimmunodeficiency or who are immunosuppressed , although TA-GCHD has not been\ndescribed in patients who are infected with HIV . \n\n \n\nLymphocyte viability is retained in stored erythrocytes for at\nleast 3 weeks , and cases of TA-GVHD following the transfusion of whole blood\n, red blood cells , platelets , and granulocytes have been reported .\n\n\nTransfusing granulocytes poses a particular risk owing to the\nfreshness and number of contaiminating lymphocytes , as well as the\nlikelihood that the recipient is immunoincompetent .\n\n\nNo cases of TA-GVHD have been described following the transfusion of\nfrozen deglycerolized cells , cryoprecipitate , fresh frozen plasma , or\nfractionated plasma products such as clotting factor concentrates , albumin ,\nand intravenous immunoglobulin . \n\n \n\nThe'threshold ' dose of lymphocytes required for the development\nof TA-GCHD in humans is unknown and may depend on the recipient  ' s ability\nto reject transfused lymphocytes .\n\n\nIn one case , the disease developed after the transfusion of only 8 x\n10  4  lymphocytes per kilogram .\n\n\nThe successful prevention of TA-GVHD thus depends on wither the\nphysical removal of donor lymphocytes or the destruction of their\nproliferative potential .\n\n\nCurrent filtration technology cannot consistently produce the levels\nof lymphocytes removal required .\n\n\nThe current mainstay of preventing lymphocytes proliferation\ncontinues to be gamma irradiation .\n\n\nThe recommended minimum dose to prevent TA-GVHD is 25 Gy.  31\n\n\n\nIt has also been shown that TA-GCHD can be transmitted to\nimmunocompetent recipients when the blood donor has a homozygous HLA\nhalpotype that is identical to one of the recipient  ' s HLA type .  \n \n\n\nGeneralised immunosuppression after transfusion   \n\n \n\nAllogeneic blood transfusions produce a variety of effects on the\nrecipient  ' s immunological functions , such as the decreased function of\nnatural killer cells , macrophage migration to site of injuries , lymphocytes\nproliferation , and cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity .\n\n\nThe presence of donor leukocytes in allogeneic blood may play a role\nin suppressing cellular immune function .\n\n\nReports have suggested that allogeneic blood transfusions increase\nthe incidence of postoperative infection and the tumour recurrence rate .\n\n\nThese reports attribute the postoperative morbidities to the\nimmunomodulatory effects of blood transfusion.  32,33 \n\n\nThis association remains unproven , however , and there is currently\ninsufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of leukodepleted blood\ncomponents for surgical patients to prevent either postoperative infection or\ntumour recurrence .    \n\n\nGraft rejection rates after organ transplantation   \n\n \n\nThe sensitisation of an individual to transplantation antigens\nby preceding transfusions can lead to graft rejection after organ\ntransplantation .\n\n\nAllogeneic blood containing leukocytes has been shown to have an\nadverse effect in patients with aplastic anaemia who undergo cone marrow\ntransplantation  34  and in renal transplant patients .\n\n\nThe sensitisation to transplant antigens can potentially be\nprevented by leukodepleting blood components that are to be used in\npretransplantation transfusions .\n\n\nLiver transplantation , however , does not seem to require HLA\nmatching or lymphocyte crossmatching before transplantation; hence ,\nleukodepleted blood components are not indicated in transfusions before this\nprocedure.  35 \n\n\nFor heart transplantations , there is currently no available\ninformation about the possible benefit of preventing HLA alloimmunisation by\nleukodepleting blood components that are to be used for pretransplantation\ntransfusions .   \n\n\nLeukodepleting blood components  \n\n \n\nAs leukocytes in the blood can cause so many undesirable effects\n, leukodepletion is the best method of preventing or delaying such effects .\n\n\nThe United States and many European countries have now decided to\nleukodeplete all cellular blood components .\n\n\nHowever , it is still controversial as to whether it is\ncost-effective to practise universal leukodepletion . \n\n \n\nA leukodepleted blood component is most commonly defined as\ncontaining fewer than 5 x 10  6  white blood cells per unit of\ncomponent .\n\n\nBlood filtration by using leukocyte filters is a commonly used\nmethod of leukodepleting blood components .\n\n\nThe filtration can be performed either at the bedside during\ntransfusion or in the component-processing laboratory .\n\n\nThe latter mode of filtration (  prestorage filtration ) is superior\nto bedside filtration because leukocytes are removed before storage , thus\npreventing further biological changes associated with the storage of these\ncells , and because quality assurance can be guaranteed .\n\n\nPerforming leukodepletion within a relatively short time - usually\nwithin 48 hours after blood collection - also eliminates leukocytes before\nthey release cytokines , fragments of cell membrane , and possibly\nintracellular viruses .\n\n\nThese factors may not be removable by bedside filtration .\n\n\nThe cytokines and cell membrane fragments may lead to FNHTRs and\nprimary HLA alloimmunisation,  36  respectively , even if the blood\nis transfused through a bedside leukocyte filter . \n\n \n\nThe temperature of filtration is also an important factor in\ndetermining the efficiency of leukocyte depletion .\n\n\nStudies have shown that colder temperatures result in the better\nleukodepletion of red blood cell concentrates.  37

Jim   \n\n\nDepartment of Geography and Geology , University of Hong Kong ,\nPokfulam Road , Hong Kong , China    \n\n\n1. Introduction and preamble  \n\n \n\nA continual quest for developable land underscored 150 years of\nurban-expansion in Hong Kong .\n\n\nThe predominantly rugged terrain is dominated by steep slopes which\nconstrain city growth in the old circumharbor core .\n\n\nRapid population and economic growth demand land which has to be\ncreated without respite by reclamation from the sea and cutting the\nhillslopes to form platforms .\n\n\nThese two modes of site formation over the years have molded the\ndirection and pace of urban development which must be preceded by laborious\ncreation of usable land .\n\n\nThe city  ' s morphology , being prevalently high-density and high-rise\n, has been dictated by this inherently limitation of land scarcity and its\nhigh production cost . \n\n \n\nLands acquired by reclamation from the sea present few\nconstraints to development , and were rapidly filled with buildings and roads\nleaving little open spaces .\n\n\nLands carved from hillslopes , however , are beset by geotechnical\nconstraints .\n\n\nTo ensure that disturbed slopes would remain stable has been a key\nconsideration in terracing hillsides .\n\n\nCutting slopes into a flight of platforms , likened to giant steps ,\nrequires much efforts to stabilize the intervening oversteepened sections .\n\n\nSometimes well vegetated pockets of residual slopes are left in the\nbuilt-up matrix as telltale legacies of the landform disturbances .\n\n\nTo maximize usable land , adjacent platforms are often separated by\nvertical faces which must be protected and reinforced against failure ,\nunless there is sound solid rock .\n\n\nIn the past , stone retaining walls ( Geotechnical Control\nOffice , 1979 &semi; Teng , 1980 ) were commonly constructed to serve\nthis purpose . \n\n \n\nContinual urban sprawl up the foothills has created many stone\nwalls .\n\n\nThe hilly northern part of Hong Kong Island , with a long development\nhistory , has most of the oldest representatives including many older than\n100 years .\n\n\nSome are conspicuously situated at roadsides , whereas others are\nsequestered behind buildings and in obscure lanes .\n\n\nOver the years , the method and the style of construction gradually\nevolved , resulting in a wide variety of walls with elaborate masonry\noccurring in equally varied environs .\n\n\nAs soon as these artificial vertical habitats were formed , nature  ' s\ncliff-hangers would begin to colonize the vacant niches .\n\n\nMost walls nurture a rich complement of flora of different growth\nforms , including mosses , lichens , ferns , herbs , shrubs , climbers and\ntrees , together with diverse wildlife .\n\n\nOf the assorted denizens , the biomass and ecological-environmental\nbenefits of large trees deserve particular attention . \n\n \n\nThe landscape of the hilly neighborhoods , otherwise monotonous\nand sterile , has been decorated by stone walls and their living companions .\n\n\nThe older crop of walls is often blanketed by dense vegetation with\nlarge trees up to 20m tall .\n\n\nThe ecological and cityscape value of such natural ingredients\ndeserve to be treasured , yet they have been largely taken for granted if not\nneglected .\n\n\nRecent widespread redevelopment of the hilly districts have damaged\nand obliterated many fine walls .\n\n\nNew city extensions into fringe slopes carve huge platforms separated\nby engineered slopes rather than retaining walls .\n\n\nNew retaining structures , occasionally needed , are invariably made\nof reinforced concrete ( to meet stringent geotechnical requirements\n) rather than stone .\n\n\nOld stones walls in Hong Kong have become a threatened heritage .\n\n\n \n\nThis study aims at assessing comprehensively this diminishing\nresource , ruderal vegetation on a special ruderal habitat ( Frenkel ,\n1970 ) .\n\n\nIntrinsic and extrinsic wall variations present a plethora of chances\nfor vegetation .\n\n\nAn empirical evaluation of both walls and trees can throw lights on\nthe ecological relationship between the two intimate partners .\n\n\nAs most wall vegetation studies were carried in the temperate lands\n( e.g. Segal , 1969 &semi; Darlington , 1981 ) , this\nhumid-tropical study can provide comparative data .\n\n\nAnalysis of detailed information gleaned in the field helps to :\n( 1 ) understand the nature , distribution and environs of\nstone walls , for plant-growth substrate in the city &semi; ( 2\n) to enumerate the species composition and relative abundance of the\nattached trees &semi; ( 3 ) to evaluate the growth condition\nand problems of the wall trees &semi; ( 4 ) to identify\ncandidate walls and trees for conservation &semi; ( 5 ) to\nexplore the long-term management strategy of old stone walls and trees . \n \n\n\n2. Study area and methods  \n\n \n\nThe location of walls were initially pinpointed on 1:1000\nlarge-scale maps .\n\n\nA reconnaissance of 100 walls in different districts provided basic\nknowledge about walls and trees to design two detailed field record forms to\nfacilitate systematic data collection .\n\n\nThe wall form assembles data on location , material , stone\ndimensions , surface smoothness , surface moisture , weathering status ,\njoint type and condition , wall aspect , inclination and exposure , wall\nenvirons , vegetation cover , integrity and threats to wall existence .\n\n\nThe tree form assesses tree position on the wall , species , tree\nheight , surface root length and density , crown spread , integrity and\nrestriction , and overall tree performance rating species .\n\n\nEach wall form is tied to one or more tree forms .\n\n\nThe possible answers were largely of a closed-ended nature to\nminimize subjective judgement and to facilitating microcomputer database\ntreatment . \n\n \n\nA pilot study on 30 walls and 60 trees was conducted to test the\napplicability of the record forms and to gather feedbacks to refine them .\n\n\nThe study area was then divided into small enclaves each\napproximately equivalent to 1 day of field work .\n\n\nMost walls were found on northern Hong Kong Island with the oldest\ncity core dating back to 1840s .\n\n\nThe field survey focused on this study area where walls over 1 m tall\nand wall tree over 1 m tall , attached on them , were evaluated .\n\n\nOnly the retaining walls ( holding back soil materials\n) were included &semi; free-standing ones were not .\n\n\nA wall tree was defined as one with most of its roots spreading on or\npenetrating through the wall face , and with the trunk base situated within\nthe confines of a wall .\n\n\nA tree overhanging above a wall but not physically attached to it ,\nand a tree with trunk base and most roots located outside a wall  ' s\nboundaries , did not qualify . \n\n \n\nA 3-month intensive field study was conducted in the summer\n( June-August ) of 1996 to gauge the trees in their prime\ngrowing season .\n\n\nA total of 505 walls and 1275 trees were assessed Wall locations were\nplotted on 1:5000 maps which was the working scale .\n\n\nTwo computer files , namely for wall and tree data , were created\nwith Microsoft Excel Version 5.0 .\n\n\nStatistical analysis was performed with SPSSPC for Windows Version\n6.1 .\n\n\nBotanical nomenclature follows those of Agriculture and Fisheries\nDepartment ( 1993 ) and Jim ( 1990 ) . \n \n\n\n3. Stone walls as vegetation habitat  \n\n \n\nThe enumerated 505 stone walls are found in the older hilly\nneighborhoods built on Hong Kong Island .\n\n\nTwo districts have a significant clustering of walls , taking up\n40% of the total number .\n\n\nThere is a marked concentration in several winding two-lane roads\nthat run largely along the contour where most large wall trees &less-than; 6\nare attached .\n\n\nThe old urban-sprawl mode tended to terrace hillslopes into small\npockets separated by stone retaining walls &semi; recent developments formed\nlarge tracts bounded by cut and fill slopes rather than walls .\n\n\nBy land use , the low- to medium-density residential areas contain\nmost walls and associated trees .\n\n\nHilly lands are mainly earmarked for better-quality private housing .\n\n\nOther land uses , except high density residential , have few and\nscattered walls . \n\n \n\nThe walls are found within 20-400 m altitudinal range , with the\nmajority in the 20-200 m bracket .\n\n\nMost walls are highly or moderately exposed , and face north which is\nthe main slope direction in the study area .\n\n\nThis factor carries both positive and negative connotations .\n\n\nExposed walls are subject to more direct sunshine and wind , and may\nbe more prone to desiccation .\n\n\nExposure , however , can allow walls to receive more rainwater by\nlateral impaction due to wind .\n\n\nFurthermore , exposure provides opportunities for the wind vector to\nadmit extraneous propagules and disseminate resident propagules . \n\n \n\nOnly a few walls incline over 10 degrees from the vertical &semi;\nthe remaining are vertical or nearly so .\n\n\nOther things being equal , inclination may allow marginally easier\nlodging of seeds .\n\n\nDeviation from the vertical can facilitate capture of rainwater .\n\n\nWall stones are mainly granite ( 60% ) which\nare lighter in color , and secondarily volcanic which are much darker .\n\n\nThe latter contains more mafic minerals which upon weathering can\nrelease more basic nutrients .\n\n\nIts dark color absorbs more radiant energy and attains a higher stone\ntemperature which accelerates drying of walls .\n\n\nNo wall is constructed with a mixture of stones .\n\n\nBoth rock types are commonly found in Hong Kong . \n\n \n\nMost stone faces have either smooth or moderately so finish ,\nwith only a few roughly-hewn .\n\n\nUneven stone surface could furnish more landing opportunities for\npropagules and more secure root anchorage .\n\n\nThe stones show different degrees of incipient weathering ,\nreflecting wall age which for many exceeds a century .\n\n\nThe most weathered ones are likely to be pre-weathered .\n\n\nWeathering rate in the humid-tropical condition , in an subaerial\nrather than subterranean environment , is unlikely to attain an advanced\nstage within the 150 years maximum tenure of the oldest walls ( Ollier\n, 1984 ) .\n\n\nThe weathered minerals can release nutrients for wall vegetation\n( Woodell , 1979 ) , supplementing a resource in restricted\nsupply . \n\n \n\nMoisture availability is a crucial factor that imparts life on\nwalls .\n\n\nSome 57% of the walls have dry surfaces despite surveying\nduring the summer rainy season .\n\n\nThe remaining walls are moist , with some having localized seepage\nand others pervasively moisture-laden .\n\n\nThe back-of-wall land use is a pivotal control of moisture status .\n\n\nInfiltrated rainwater soaking the soil behind walls supplies seepage\noutflow through weep holes and joints .\n\n\nExtensive stretch of vegetated slope above walls provides a ready\nsource of moisture replenishment .\n\n\nWalls situated on the upper edge of the city have such a favorable\ndisposition .\n\n\nOccasionally , in times of heavy downpour at an intensity exceeding\nsoil infiltration capacity , surface runoff may spread from the abutting\nslope onto or cascade down wall faces , and water may shoot out of weepholes .\n \n\n \n\nFor the few walls adjacent to well-wooded companion slopes , the\nhigh humidity environment allowed capture of atmospheric moisture in a\nprocess similar to fog straining .\n\n\nA well vegetated slope is more able to store water and release it\ngradually over a longer period between rainfalls .\n\n\nMoreover , a site with luxuriant vegetation cover has more organic\nmatter and more fertile soils , thus generating more eutrophic outflows .\n\n\nThe nutrients thus conveyed to walls , a continual material input\ninto the mural ecosystem , constitute an important means of sustenance for\nvegetation .\n\n\nStones can hardly store water and the tiny volume of soil in the\njoints has meager storage capacity .\n\n\nFor small plants with limited root spread , the timeliness and\nadequacy of water supply is a critical survival determinant . \n\n \n\nSurface area of walls is limited , with 79% in the\n&less-than; 250 m&squared; small class , and only a few in the large 750-1000\nand &greater-than; 1000 m&squared; categories .\n\n\nThe largest wall attains 2340 m&squared; .\n\n\nBy linear dimensions ( Table 1 and Fig. 1 ) , most\nwalls are 2.5-5.0 m in height and 25-50 m width .\n\n\nThe longest wall reaches 310 m and the tallest 12 m .\n\n\nThe wide walls are dominated by granite , whereas the tall walls are\nboth granitic and volcanic .\n\n\nIn line with the species-area concept , large walls were expected to\naccommodate more species .\n\n\nBesides presenting a large physical surface for plant attachment ,\nthey are likely to furnish more microvariations in habitat conditions , hence\na diversity of niches .\n\n\nThey are also more conspicuous if not imposing urban landscape\nfeatures .\n\n\nTall walls , however , are more likely to be construed as a safety\nthreat especially if they are situated close to buildings . \n\n \n\nMost stones are 30-40 cm height and 20-60 cm wide &semi; the\nwidest stones reach over 200 cm , and the tallest over 60 cm ( Fig. 2\n) .\n\n\nWalls made of large stones are mainly granitic .\n\n\nSmall stone means more gaps between individual ones , hence a better\nchance for seepage , propagule lodging and root anchorage .\n\n\nSome 77% of the walls have regularly-shaped stones , either\nsquare or rectangular , and the remainder are irregular ( subrounded\nor subangular ) .\n\n\nIrregularity provides <0> 2-graphs </0> more and wider\ninter-stone gaps furnishing benefits analogous to small stones .\n\n\nMost joints are mortared with flush or ribbon pointing .\n\n\nOnly 3.6% of the walls have open joints , being the oldest\nrepresentatives .\n\n\nMost joints are either intact/original or intact/repaired &semi; few\nwalls have broken mortar at the joints .\n\n\nWith open or broken joints , advantages similar to small stones\nmentioned above can be achieved .   \n\n\n4. Characteristics of wall trees  \n\n \n\nThe surveyed walls contain vegetation of different growth forms\n, ranging from mosses and lichens , to ferns and herbs , and to shrubs and\ntrees .\n\n\nThe wall plants are due to spontaneous colonization unassisted by\nhuman actions .\n\n\nAs mimicry of nature  ' s rocky precipices , the wall habitat is\nexpected to harbor a similar plant assemblage .\n\n\nThe humid-tropical environment of Hong Kong , with an inherently\nrich native flora enriched by exotic components , has many candidate species\nwith different degrees of suitability to wall existence .\n\n\nSome 49.5% of the walls harbor trees , a total 1275\nindividuals from 30 species , which are conspicuous by virtue of biomass ,\necological and environmental significance ( Table 1 and Table 2\n) .\n\n\nIn comparison , roadside trees in urban Hong Kong reach 149 species\n( Jim , 1996 ) , and the total tree species of the territory is\nabout 300 ( Agricultural and Fisheries Department , 1993 ) .\n\n\nIn relative terms , the tree species diversity on walls is subdued .\n\n\nIn terms of habitat stress level and limited surface area , that\nsome 30 species can establish despite the heavy odds is an impressive record .\n\n\nNo data on wall vegetation in other tropical areas is available for\ncomparison .\n\n\nTemperate-latitude walls are dominated by non-woody species of herbs\n, ferns and lower plants , with trees as minor or rare elements (\nSegal , 1969 ) . \n\n \n\nThe tree stock is dominated by a small number of common species\n, accompanied by uncommon to rare ones ( Table 2 ) .\n\n\nThe top three species take up 72.7% and the top 12 as high\nas 96.7% .\n\n\nSome 18 species have frequencies below 10 , of which 11 are solitary\nspecimens .\n\n\nMost walls have two to five species each &semi; those with less than\ntwo or more than five species are less common .\n\n\nNative species are predominant , mainly Moraceae ( Mulberry\nfamily ) , and to a lesser extent Ulmaceae ( Elm family\n) ,  Oleaceae ( Olive family ) ,\nMyrsinaceae ( Ardisia family ) , Euphorbiaceae ( Spurge\nfamily ) , and Lauraceae ( Laurel family ) .\n\n\nExotic trees are rarely found , constituting merely 1.89%\nfrom six species .\n\n\nOnly one of the top 12 species is exotic &semi; the remaining five\nexotic species are sparsely represented . \n\n \n\nBy botanical family , Moraceae is overwhelming dominant with\nseven species and 87.6% of the trees .\n\n\nThe genus  Ficus  contributing six species , five of which\nare native , is the undisputed arboreal leader on walls .\n\n\nThe evergreen  Ficus microcarpa  alone occupies 50%\nof the wall-tree population .\n\n\nThe species is naturally found in local woodlands of the lowland\nevergreen variety ( Zhang et al. , 1989 ) .\n\n\nIt is commonly planted as amenity trees in the city ( Jim ,\n1990 ) , furnishing the largest and oldest urban specimens including\nhigh-caliber champion trees ( Jim , 1994a , b ) .\n\n\nIt is renowned for huge final size up to 20 m in height and crown\nspread , for longevity easily over 500 years , and for environmental\ntolerance to persevere in stressful urban sites .\n\n\nThe species stocks most walls and most of the largest wall trees .\n\n\nThey are the wall-tree par excellence of the city , providing\nimportant landmark features in the hilly neighborhoods .\n\n\nMoreover , they serve as wildlife habitats especially for birds ,\nadding faunal diversity to the city  ' s biotic community .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "981b133c-7f3b-4353-9404-de4bb8a32763", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.081190+00:00"}
{"text": "Hard lessons from Indonesia   \n\n\n Tung  ' s weakness , like those of Wahid , may undermine his\ngoodwill   \n\n\n ANTHONY CHEUNG   \n\n\nCOMMENTARY \n\n \n\n A  POST-MORTEM of the downfall of Indonesian\npresident Abdurahman Wahid would probably find him generally a liberal-minded\nperson with religious tolerance .\n\n\nHe managed during his brief reign to lift many of the restrictions on\nIndonesian society imposed during president Suharto  ' s military regime . \n\n \n\nMr Wahid  ' s ascendancy to power two years ago was welcomed by his\npeople and the international community at large .\n\n\nAll hoped then that it would mark the beginning of democratic\ntransition and a more stable society . \n\n \n\nHowever , he took office as a politically weak president ,\ndepending on support from a flimsy and changeable coalition in the People  ' s\nConsultative Assembly , whose first objective was to keep Megawati\nSukarnoputri from power and then to seize upon him .\n\n\nThe irony of the whole saga is that Ms. Megawati subsequently turned\nout to be the rallying point for the same batch of politicians , who by now\ndemanded his demise . \n\n \n\nBeing a weak leader , Mr Wahid should have spent more time\ncultivating and consolidating cross-sector support .\n\n\nInstead he tried to behave as though he were a strong president .\n\n\nHe ignored the fact that previous presidents Suharto and Sukarno were\nable to be strong leaders only so long as they enjoyed the unwavering support\nof the military . \n\n \n\nFirst , he alienated the military , which is still the No 1\nfactor to reckon with in Indonesian politics , over East Timor and by\nover-reshuffling the military high command . \n\n \n\nAt the same time he alienated the Jakarta bureaucracy by going\ntoo soft on the regions .\n\n\nThen he alienated most of the parties by refusing to share power .\n\n\n \n\nWhen his leadership crumbled , with his orders increasingly\nunenforceable , big business and intellectuals started to desert him . \n\n \n\nHis lesson should be well studied by government leaders in the\nregion , including Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa .\n\n\nAlthough Mr Tung can operate almost \" presidentially\" , given his\nwide-ranging powers and the executive-led tradition , the Basic Law does\nallow the legislature to vote down his major legislation or budgets , so as\nto trigger a new legislative election and possibly his resignation should the\nelectorate return an assembly that still refuses to budge . \n\n \n\nDespite cries for power and accusations of being sidelined ,\nlegislators fail to realise that should they become united as a force , they\nwould have immense bargaining power vis-&agrave;-vis the Chief Executive .\n\n\nIf the parties and independents in the Legislative Council form into\na coalition , they can make or break the government . \n\n \n\nWhat has rendered such confrontation impossible , at least for\nthe time being , is that parties continue to be divided on ideological lines\nand some toe Beijing  ' s political line . \n\n \n\nThe Central People  ' s Government has an impact on SAR politics\nsomewhat similar to the military factor in Indonesian politics .\n\n\nAs long as Beijing is happy with Mr Tung , his tenure is secure .\n\n\n \n\nBut relying on his constitutional powers or Beijing  ' s backing\ncan in no way make Mr Tung a strong leader locally .\n\n\nWhen he first came to office , he was generally regarded as an honest\nand acceptable person without political baggage .\n\n\nHis good links with Beijing , the United States and Taiwan were\nhailed as his assets . \n\n \n\nHowever , four years later , his style of government and his\nmishandled \" reforms ' have added many to his list of critics and\ndoubters , in addition to the pro-democracy camp .\n\n\nHe has alienated the civil service bureaucracy , workers , the middle\nclasses , and even some businessmen and pro-Beijing leftists who should have\nbeen his staunch supporters . \n\n \n\nIf Mr Tung  ' s position is essentially at the mercy of Beijing ,\nthis does not bode well for Hong Kong because he would then become a captured\nChief Executive . \n\n \n\nBesides , if he is really keen to promote much-needed reforms for\nHong Kong  ' s good , as Mr Wahid similarly intended to achieve in the early\nmonths of his presidency , he should all the more give utmost priority to\ncultivating political support and winning over doubters and even enemies ,\nand be willing to work more closely with the legislature and the parties .\n\n\n \n\n  Dr .

the tax myth   \n\n\n An overhaul of fiscal policy is needed in these gloomy times\n  \n\n\n ANTHONY CHEUNG   \n\n\nCOMMENTARY \n\n \n\n T  HE Advisory Committee on New Broad-Based Taxes\nreleased its report last week , setting out various options for new taxes ,\nincluding the much talked-about goods and services tax . \n\n \n\nSo far community and business reaction to the report is quite\nnegative .\n\n\nIndeed , a poor economic climate is not conducive to raising taxes or\nfees , not to mention introducing a new taxation .\n\n\nEconomists also worry that a tax increase may further dampen an\nalready stagnant economy as a result of less disposable income being\navailable to consumers . \n\n \n\nThe politics of taxation is such that at times of economic booms\n, people do not generally accept the need for a tax increase and , when the\neconomy turns bad , they doubt if the society can bear the burden of more\ntaxes . \n\n \n\nIn the present gloomy days , the government owes the public a\nstrong case to justify new taxes .\n\n\nIt is not good enough to say there is sufficient revenue to pay for\nits operating expenses .\n\n\nAn immediate question to ask is whether the government has already\ndone enough to keep the public sector lean and efficient . \n\n \n\nWith the bulk of recurrent expenditure (  some 70 to 80 per cent\namong departments ) taken up by staff salaries and related costs , and the\ncivil service predominately (  over 95 per cent ) on permanent and pensionable\nterms , the room for the government to adjust expenditure levels in line with\neconomic and fiscal performance is rather limited .\n\n\nThe proliferation of layers within the bureaucracy and the rigid\ncivil service pay structure , which is not subject to regular reviews for\nvarious reasons , have made public expenditure all the more difficult to\ncontain .\n\n\nThis is an inherent structural problem of public finance . \n\n \n\nBesides , the government still holds some &dollar;430 billion in\nfiscal reserve , which many have demanded be tapped so as to support more\npublic services and major infrastructure projects without having to levy more\ntaxes or to increase fees and charges . \n\n \n\nOne must , however , realise that Hong Kong  ' s \" high\nreserve , low taxation ' legacy is a result of unique conditions in the past ,\nwhich will not likely repeat .\n\n\nIt is appropriate for the government to use part of the reserve to\ncover temporary budget deficits .\n\n\nThat is what the reserve is there for .\n\n\nBut even a comfortable level of fiscal reserve is not going to cope\nwith any long-term structural deficit . \n\n \n\nThe case of a structural deficit has yet to be established .\n\n\nBut it is clear that apart from cost rigidities , public finance also\nsuffers from an unduly income-dependent and narrow base for taxation revenue\n, which renders it more vulnerable during an economic slowdown .\n\n\nAt present , the government derives 46 per cent of total revenue from\npersonal , corporate and property-related taxation , and another 25 per cent\nin non-tax income from land sales , properties and investments . \n\n \n\nUntil the Asian financial crisis burst the economic bubble , the\npublic had been led to believe that the Hong Kong miracle of low taxation and\nreasonably good welfare could be sustained for a long time .\n\n\nBecause of incessant booms in the stock and real-estate markets up to\n1997 , generating enormous revenues for the public coffers , the government\nwas able to grant significant tax relief to most sectors during the final\nyears of British administration in response to popular demands .\n\n\nIn the process , the tax base had been narrowed further . \n\n \n\nIt is not too late for both the government and the community at\nlarge to realise that the economic bubble is over and so is the previous\nfiscal myth .\n\n\nThe pot-crisis economy of Hong Kong has yet to find ways of\nlonger-term recovery . \n\n \n\nHowever , the writing on the wall is not encouraging .\n\n\nThe stock and real-estate markets are still at low ebb .\n\n\nThere are signs of industrial hollowing-out and the service sector ,\nwhich now employs the highest proportion of our workforce , is not doing well\neither .\n\n\nOur overall competitiveness is in question , with structural\nunemployment on the rise . \n\n \n\nSuch a macro-economic scenario must be the primary concern for\nany major tax-reform strategy .\n\n\nUnless we are able to maintain the size of the pie , if not enlarge\nit , simply cutting corners here and there and increasing taxes and fees will\nnot ultimately do the magic . \n\n \n\nIn the short run , more taxation on a population suffering\ndeclining income or indiscriminate spending cuts in essential services might\nbe counter-productive , and might trigger further social discontent and\nunrest . \n\n \n\nThat is not to say that comprehensive tax reform should be\navoided in the long run .\n\n\nHowever , the government has to articulate the reform within the\nlarger context of economic restructuring and stimulation , and in terms of a\nmore proactive strategy to rerationalise the revenue and expenditure\nstructures . \n\n \n\n  Dr .

growth model , rather than local private-sector entrepreneurship .\n\n\n \n\nIn building up Singapore Inc , the government actively intervenes\nin and dominates the economy , education , housing , health care , employment\nand social security .\n\n\nWhile citizens are guaranteed a social safety net and decent housing\n, they are also forced to save through the CPF , which then provides a cheap\nsource of funds for public investments .\n\n\nSince the 1970s , wage levels in both the public and private sectos\nhave been subject to control under National Wage Council guidelines . \n\n \n\nThere are extensive public-sector reforms in Singapore , but\nthese are not premised on civil-service bashing as elsewhere .\n\n\nInstead they aim at enhancing the bureaucracy  ' s capacity to lead the\nnation , anticipate problems and crises and open up a new frontier in the\nface of globalisation . \n\n \n\nSuch a state-dominated development strategy may not fit Hong Kong .\n\n\nUnlike Singapore , we have an active and strong private-sector\neconomy . \n\n \n\nBut though we do not need Singapore  ' s kind of state paternalism\nand economic controls , our government should acquire the same sense of\nsocial leadership and \" stakeholder society &rdquo; if Hong Kong is to\nsurvive and prosper in the new globalised century . \n\n \n\nOnly countries that display strong overall capacity to transform\ncan excel in the global economy .\n\n\nFor too long , the Hong Kong government has held on to the colonial\nparadigm of self-sufficiency and minimum intervention .\n\n\nThere has been , of course , some government intervention and\nregulation , but these have been mostly short-term policy responses rather\nthan part of any forward-looking strategic design in which the role of\ngovernment was recognised instead of denigrated . \n\n \n\nThis caretaker mentality has not fundamentally changed since 1997 .\n\n\nEven though Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa likes to make big plans ,\nsuch plans are mostly conceived within either the bureaucracy or inner\nbusiness circles .\n\n\nThey lack wider social input and support .\n\n\nThere is also the danger of the government simply taking contingency\nsteps in multifarious but sometimes contradictory directions in order to\nsatisfy short-term demands from all kinds of special interests . \n\n \n\nNot wanting a \" bossy &rdquo; state is not the same as not\nneeding a government that has leadership capacity in society . \n\n \n\nIt is time to discard the dogmatic state-society dichotomy ,\nwhich places the state and society/economy within a zero-sum relationship .\n\n\nInasmuch we need a joined-up government that has good co-ordinating\ncapacity , we also need a joined-up society in which a strong government\nco-exists and links up with industry and other major stakeholders to\nfacilitate social consensus and to generate social capital for economic\ntransformation and growth . \n\n \n\nIn the current economic downturn , there is little that the\ngovernment can do in the short run to revive the economy .\n\n\nBut some measures to help the hard-hit to get through the economic\nstress are still warranted .\n\n\nLong-run solutions lie with structural changes in the economy ,\nwhich would entail pains of adaptation and hence require all the more a\nstrong social consensus to take them forward . \n\n \n\nMr Tung may well take inspiration from Taiwan  ' s recent\neconomic-development conference and convene a Hong Kong economic summit where\nleaders from major sectors and parties congregate to map out strategic\nresponses . \n\n \n\n  Dr .

{"text": "MONDAY , JUNE 30TH , 1997  \n\n\n NOON  \n\n \n\nYou don't stand when you travel on the subway in Hong Kong at rush\nhour .\n\n\nNor do you sit .\n\n\nYou sort of hover , your body held suspended in the unconscious but\nunshakeable grip of the colony  ' s worker ants .\n\n\nThis thought flashed briefly through Davis Lee  ' s mind as he wrapped\nhis leg as tightly as he could around the steel pole in the middle of the\ncarriage and ground his teeth together. \n\n \n\nFor the lighter traveller , subway journeys are a risky business .\n\n\nStories of wedged passengers being helplessly carried off packed\ntrains at the wrong station are legend . \n\n \n\nThe train shimmered into Admiralty station and came to a gradual\nhalt , which it announced with a relieved hiss .\n\n\nHe gripped the pole more firmly .\n\n\nThe doors trilled an e-flat and flung themselves open , triggering\nanxious tremors in the glove of commuters which held him .\n\n\nIt seemed as if several thousand people got out of the carriage , but\nmagically , there appeared to be as many still in it. \n\n \n\n\n'  Cheng sui-sam che mun  .\n\n\nPlease stand clear of the train door , &rdquo; said a recorded female\nvoice with exaggeratedly precise articulation .\n\n\nThe hum changed pitch , became a staccato squeal , and the doors\nsighed shut .\n\n\nThe tube of human bodies , lightly wrapped in their thin metal jacket\n, lurched forwards again. \n\n \n\nThank goodness Chinese people don't smell , though Davis ,\nrecalling the more horrific rush-hour trips during his lengthy sojourns\nabroad .\n\n\nHe shut his eyes , lowered his shoulders and let himself relax\nagainst the warm fabric wall clutching him .\n\n\nSo many people .\n\n\nAnd this wasn't even the real rush hour .\n\n\nThis was merely the cross-harbour pre-lunch surge , intensified by\ntoday  ' s unusual holiday arrangements. \n\n \n\nHe had learned early in his commuting days that it was impossible\nto read on the rightly named Mass transit Railway .\n\n\nThe first time he had taken a paperback with him - a book chosen for\nits slimness - he had held it 12 inches away from his face to allow his\n36-year-old eyes to focus on it .\n\n\nThe distance proved too great .\n\n\nHe and the book had been swiftly and unwittingly parted at a busy\nstation. \n\n \n\nThe train moved almost imperceptibly to the right , and then left .\n\n\nTo keep some semblance of balance , he planted his feet as far apart\nas he could , which was about eight inches , and swayed slightly as the\ncylinder flew along its gently curved path through the rock. \n\n \n\nThe recorded voice spoke again:  '   Dai yaht jaaam hai Jung\nWan  .\n\n\nThe next station is Central. ' \n\n \n\nDavis had taken to passing his travelling time with a mental\nexercise focusing on the clothes that were pressed into his face .\n\n\nThis involved delving into his memory to the two years straight after\nhis American MBA , which he had spent in a Johor Baru garment factory .\n\n\nA 65/35 polyester-cotton mix had his or her elbow deep into his\nkidney .\n\n\nA musty-smelling mohair suits in light charcoal kept leaning back\ninto the left side of his face. \n\n \n\nFive years overseas meant he was seeing Hong Kong from the\nviewpoint of an outsider , reminding him of his first arrival in the fabled\ncity-state , as a wide-eyed eight-year-old from Xinjuang who felt as if he\nhad touched down on another planet. \n\n \n\nOnce more the train came to a careful halt and the doors sprang\nopen .\n\n\nThis time Davis moved slowly towards them , trying to anticipate the\nmoves of the passengers between him and the outside . \n\n \n\nSuddenly someone yanked him backwards by his right wrist .\n\n\nHe caught his breath .\n\n\nHe tugged sharply .\n\n\nThere was a yelp of pain and surprise. \n\n \n\n'What - let me go.'\n\n\nThis was a Western female voice nearby. \n\n \n\nDavis peered through the moving bodies to try to see who was\nholding his wrist - and apparently someone else  ' s - so tightly .\n\n\nHe caught a brief glimpse of a struggling woman about 30 inches - or\ntwo bodies - away from him .\n\n\nSomeone else in trouble .\n\n\nWhat was going on? \n\n \n\nOver the next few seconds , the people around him dissolved and\nhe looked down at his wrist .\n\n\nHe gasped .\n\n\n\n'  Mutyeh  ?  '  A steel manacle encircled the bottom of\nhis palm .\n\n\nThere was a heavy chain leading from it .\n\n\nHe realized it was half a pair of handcuffs , and the other rings was\non the other side of the steel pole , around the wrist of a  gwaipor\n , who was making sharp pulling motions .\n\n\nHe was shackled to her. \n\n \n\nShe looked up and their eyes met .\n\n\n'Who are you ?\n\n\nGet this off .\n\n\nPlease .\n\n\nThere must be some mistake.'\n\n\nThere was fear in her eyes , and he realized that she thought he had\ndeliberately snapped the bracelet onto her arm. \n\n \n\n'It  ' s not mine, ' he said , looking for a catch or a button or a\nclasp with which he could release himself .\n\n\nThere was none .\n\n\n'I cannot get it off. ' \n\n \n\n'Please. ' \n\n \n\n'It  ' s not mine .\n\n\nI do not have any key. ' \n\n \n\n'Well , who has the key? ' \n\n \n\n'I don't know. ' \n\n \n\n'Why are you doing this ?\n\n\nGet this off .\n\n\nI have to get off at this stop .\n\n\nIs this some sort of joke? ' Her voice swung from irritation to fear\nand back again. \n\n \n\n'It  ' s not me doing this - I don't know - I get off here , also ,\ncome on.'\n\n\nHe slipped behind her side of the steel pole and the two of them\nstepped off the train .\n\n\nThey stood there in silent bafflement for a moment .\n\n\nThe air-powered doors hissed noisily behind them .\n\n\n'Is this some sort of trick? ' said the European woman , picking\nineffectually at the bracelets joining her left wrist to his right. \n\n \n\nThe situation was so sudden , so absurd , so ridiculous that\nDavis did not know how to react .\n\n\n\n'  Jun hai  - truly , I don't know how this happened .\n\n\nSomeone must have _'\n\n\nHe scanned the station desperately to see if there was an answer on\nthe platform .\n\n\nAll he saw was a mother who had stopped to tie her toddler  ' s\nshoelaces , a cluster of students talking to each other , and an old man\nhobbling away before the next train spilled another flood of humanity onto\nthe platform .\n\n\n\n'  Aieeyah  . ' \n\n \n\n'How did this happen? ' her voice was stern. \n\n \n\n'I don't know .\n\n\nI am telling the truth .\n\n\nSomeone must have ... while we were on train , someone must have ,\nwell , stuck them on us .\n\n\nIt just seems... so crazy...  ji-seen  . ' \n\n \n\nShe looked him hard in the eye and he instinctively glanced down\nat the handcuffs .\n\n\n'You look really guilty, ' she said .\n\n\n'Which probably means you  ' re telling the truth .\n\n\nIt must be some sort of practical joke .\n\n\nAlthough what the point is... and who.. ?\n\n\nWho would lock two strangers together ?\n\n\nWhy? ' She also started looking around her , for an answer which did\nnot seem to exist .\n\n\n'How do we get out from these? ' said Davis .\n\n\n'I have very important appointment...'\n\n\nHe continued to scan the platform , looking for - what ?\n\n\nHe spotted the emergency phone on the wall .\n\n\n'Let us call the  ging-chaat  , the police , the\nguards .\n\n\nThis... is very strange. ' \n\n \n\nHe strode towards the wall , and she careful kept pace with him .\n\n\nA young hard voice spoke from behind them .\n\n\n'Er... hold it right there , guys .\n\n\nWe want to talk to you .\n\n\nHang on .\n\n\nMr Lee? ' \n\n \n\nIt took a second for Davis to register that they were being\nspoken to .\n\n\nHe turned of see the group of students was approaching .\n\n\nThe speaker was a thin-limbed male of indeterminate race with messy\n, pepper-and-salt hair .\n\n\nDavid spoke angrily. \n\n\n'Hai mee-yeh see ?\n\n\nLei wan been-goh ?\n\n\nNgaw yihga mm duk haan , ho mong .\n\n\nNei sing mee yeh  ?  ' \n\n\nHe noticed the youth was Eurasian and switched to English .\n\n\n'Did you put this on to us ?\n\n\nTake it off , please .\n\n\nWho do you want ?\n\n\nWho are you ?\n\n\nI am very busy. ' \n\n \n\nThe grey-haired student smiled: a knowing , dangerously bright\nsmile in an unexpectedly young face .\n\n\nUnder the old head of hair , he had the unwrinkled eyes of a boy in\nhis late teens , maybe 20 .\n\n\n'There has been no mistake , Mr Lee .\n\n\nCould you come with us for a moment ?\n\n\nI  ' ll explain.'\n\n\nBehind the young man , he saw several youths , grinning , their\nfaces excited .\n\n\nA prank of some sort ?\n\n\nA case of mistaken identity ? \n\n \n\n\n'  Mee-yeh wa ?\n\n\nNgoh mm mingbaak  . ' \n\n \n\nThe student turned to the Western woman .\n\n\n'Sorry about the inconvenience , Ms Manley .\n\n\nJust come with us , and we  ' ll explain .\n\n\nPlease .\n\n\nJust come this way.'\n\n\nHe seemed to notice the fear in her face .\n\n\nOne of his hands hovered near her shoulder , wanting to give it a\nreassuring touch , but was unable to land .\n\n\n'You  ' re in no danger .\n\n\nPlease. ' \n\n \n\nHer expression changed .\n\n\nDavis could see that she had decided that these were not lunatics ,\nbut apparently normal people - people who knew her name .\n\n\nHer pale eyes narrowed .\n\n\n'Do I have a choice ?\n\n\nI like to have a choice in these things , I  ' m extremely busy , you\nknow .\n\n\nIs this some kind of joke ?\n\n\nAre you students ?\n\n\nLook , I like a joke as much as the next person , but not today .\n\n\nTake this things off me , please. ' \n\n \n\n'Just come with us and I  ' ll explain .\n\n\nPlease .\n\n\nIt  ' s for a good cause .\n\n\nThe best cause in the world .\n\n\nPlease?'\n\n\nThere was a hard insistent edge under the young man  ' s friendly\nwords . \n\n\n  ' Ngoh mm duk-haan,   '  interrupted Davis .\n\n\n'I am not free .\n\n \n\nI cannot .\n\n\nI am meeting someone .\n\n\nMeeting someone upstairs at 12 o'clock, ' he said , his quiet voice\nsounding calm in contrast with that of his agitated fellow prisoner. \n\n \n\n'So am I , &rdquo; said Ms Manley. \n\n \n\n'No you  ' re not , &rdquo; said the young man , unable to prevent\na flash of glee .\n\n\n'You were both told to meet Mr Edgar Benitez-Ropes in the main\nconcourse of Central station at 12 noon , right ?\n\n\nWell here I am - I  ' m Edgar Benitez-Ropes , and I  ' m delighted to\nmeet you.'\n\n\nHe flashed his too-bright smile at them once more .\n\n\n'But there is another person - another friend I said I would meet\nthere too, ' said Davis. \n\n \n\nEdgar looked him suspiciously in the eye .\n\n\n'Oh , really ?\n\n\nWell , it  ' s - uh - 12.04 now .\n\n\nCome on .\n\n\nWe  ' re going upstairs , so we can pick up your other friend on the\nway , if he  ' s there. ' \n\n \n\nThe group moved to the escalator and were carried upstairs as a\nsudden gale filled the tunnel .\n\n\nThe dragon-roar of the next train arriving filled the tunnels below\nthem .\n\n\nOne of the students was a Caucasian girl who had wisps of blonde and\nbrass-coloured hair sticking out of a head-scarf .\n\n\nNext to her stood a very tall , worried-looking youth with bad acne.\n\n\n \n\n'Who are you supposedly meeting? ' said Edgar , clearly remaining\nsceptical as he stood on the step above Davis. \n\n \n\nHe paused before answering .\n\n\nHow to react ?\n\n\nWould it not be indiscreet to pass Yuan Chi-hua'a name on to these\npeople ?\n\n\nWho were they ?\n\n\nBut perhaps he should tell them , he thought .\n\n\nMaybe the fact that he had a very busy schedule would be an excuse\nto extract himself from this game , or joke , or publicity stunt or whatever\nit was .\n\n\n'I  ' m meeting someone very important. ' \n\n \n\nThe agitated  gwaipor  - what did he say her name\nwas ? - suddenly interrupted .\n\n\n'How did you do this? '  Edgar turned to her , his face beaming\nwith pride .\n\n\n'We  ' ve had people following you both for the past hour .\n\n\nWe planned to clip you together upstairs when we all met , but I had\nbeen hoping we would have an opportunity to do it earlier.'\n\n \n\nHis smile burst into a laugh .\n\n\n'Ha .\n\n\nForcing you two together in the crowd was surprisingly easy .\n\n\nGetting the handcuffs onto you without you even noticing - well ,\nthat was my own special contribution.'\n\n\nThe students behind them sniggered guiltily , two girls with their\nhands clapped over their mouths. \n\n \n\nThe group reached the top of the escalator and laboriously\nexited through the narrow ticket barriers .\n\n\nDavis and the woman had trouble , since the turnstiles were designed\nto be used by one person at a time , using their right hands to feed the\nticket into the slot. \n\n \n\n'Where are you meeting your friend? ' \n\n \n\n'There, ' said Davis , spotting Yuan out of the corner of his\neye. \n\n \n\nThe old man , who was wearing an obviously expensive Italian\nsuit and garish rings on all fingers , strode up to them .\n\n\nA cloud of Aramis suddenly enveloped the group .\n\n\nHe said in a Singaporean accent;  ' Hey !\n\n\nDavis .\n\n\nHow are you ?\n\n\nGood to see you .\n\n\nThese friends of yours , is it ?\n\n\nYou  ' re looking.... ' \n\n \n\nHis voice trailed off as he shook his friend  ' s hand and noticed\nthat it was handcuffed to the left wrist of the woman next to him .\n\n\n'Hmm, ' he said , two vertical lines appearing between his eyebrows .\n\n\n'We have an interesting situation here , is it? ' \n\n \n\n'I won't ask you to shake my hand, ' said the woman , icily .\n\n\nSince you have just done so. ' \n\n \n\nThe Singaporean looked quizzically at Davis , as if to ask what\nwas going on .\n\n\n'So just who has arrested who? ' he asked with a rather uncertain\ntrace of a laugh in his voice. \n\n \n\n'Please, ' said Edgar .\n\n\n'Could all of you please follow me .\n\n\nAnd you , Mr...? ' \n\n \n\n'Yuan Chi-hua. ' \n\n \n\n\n' ...Mr Yuan .\n\n\nAll of you .\n\n\nPlease.'\n\n\nEdgar beckoned them like a unconfident fireman trying to entice a\ncat from a treetop. \n\n \n\nYuan looked uncertainly at the young man with the bird  ' s nest\nhair , but as the group began to move , he fell into step a few yards behind\nhis friend. \n\n \n\n'Sorry, ' said David , giving his friend a weak smile .\n\n\n'This will only take few minutes .\n\n\nVery sorry .\n\n\nNice to see you.'\n\n\nHe thought it would be hard to move while shackled to another person\n, but here it made little difference. \n\n \n\nWalking through the Central subway station on a busy day was a\nslow , stop-start business anyway .\n\n\nThere were so many exits , stairs , shops , escalators moving\nupwards and downwards , that the strings of people heading in each direction\nconstantly broke each other up , like an ill-rehearsed folk dance. \n\n \n\nThe party got to the surface without any major problems , and\nwere led towards World-Wide House .\n\n\nThe outside air was furnace-hot , and Davis almost immediately felt\na trickle of sweat run down his collar .\n\n\nYet he was surprised by how calm he was , how easily he has accepted\nwhat was , after all , a distinctly unusual situation .\n\n\nPerhaps it was the fact that life felt so disjointed at the moment\nfor - well , for so many other reasons .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "dc725bc6-5a72-487e-bf49-8a1df53c8733", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.083834+00:00"}

{"text": "Emergency management of poisoning in Hong Kong   \n\n\nFL Lau \n\n \n\n\nThe emergency management of poisoning is important in reducing the\nrisk of mortality and morbidity in poisoned patients .\n\n\nThis article reviews the Hong Kong system of prehospital and emergency\ncare of poisoning , with reference to recent advances in this field .\n\n\nAdministrating activated charcoal is recommended for the\ngastro-intestinal decontamination of most poisons , unless doing do is\ncontra-indicated .\n\n\nGastric lavage should be considered only in life-threatening cases of\npoisoning that present within the first hour .\n\n\nNewer antidotes that are available in Hong Kong accident and emergency\ndepartments include hydroxocobalamin , stonefish and snake antevenenes ,\ndigoxin-specific antibodies , esmolol hydrochloride , and octreotide .\n\n\nThe  ' golden hour ' concept of gastro-intestinal demonstration is\nadvocated and ways to ensure that decontamination is performed within the  ' golden\nhour ' are suggested .    \n\n\nIntroduction  \n\n \n\nPoisoning is a somewhat neglected area in clinical medicine in\nHong Kong .\n\n\nIt is not subspecialty in most clinical units and the standard of\nmanaging poisoned patients is highly variable .\n\n\nWith the shift of emphasis in the management of poisoning from\nin-patient care to early decontamination and initial stabilisation ,\nemergency physicians are taking a more active role in the care of poisoned\npatients .\n\n\nIn this article , the emergency management of poisoned patients in\nHong Kong is reviewed , with reference to recent updates in the literature\nand the different practices elsewhere .   \n\n\nPrehospital management  \n\n \n\nThe emergency management of poisoning starts from the scene of\nthe event , where early induction of vomiting can remove a significant\nportion of the ingested poison .\n\n\nIt is not clear , however , whether early or late induction of\nvomiting influences the outcome .\n\n\nIn countries where poisons information centres are accessible to the\npublic , people are advised to keep some ipecacuanha (  Ipecac Syrup USP or\nPaediatric Ipecacuanha Emetic Mixture BP ) at home .\n\n\nIf poisons are ingested , the poisons information centre can be\ncalled for advice prior to inducing vomiting with ipecacuanha .\n\n\nThis practice has been shown to reduce visits to emergency\ndepartments for paediatric  1  and other poisonings .\n\n\nIn Hong Kong , The Drug and Poisons Information Bureau at the Prince\nof Wales Hospital provides a 24-hour advice service that is staffed by the\nDivision of Clinical Pharmacology of The Chinese University of Hong Kong .\n\n\nBecause of the limited resources , however , it mainly takes calls\nfrom health care workers and is generally not accessible to the public. \n2  \n\n \n\nWhen the toxic agent ingested is not known , it is not available\nto induce vomiting by the gag reflex or with chemical agents .\n\n\nIf the toxic agent is a corrosive , vomiting will inflict a second\ninsult on the upper gastro-intestinal tract .\n\n\nFurthermore , aspiration of vomit in patients with decreasing\nconsciousness can be fatal .\n\n\nThe most useful and simple advice for the on-site treatment of\npoisoning is as follows: (  1 ) to irrigate external chemical burns with plenty\nof water; (  2 ) if corrosive have been ingested , to drink a cup of water or\nmilk , which may dilute the corrosive and reduce tissue damage , provided the\npatient can protect his or her own airway; and (  3 ) to immerse stings from\nstonefish or other deep-sea fish in hot water (  at 45\u00b0C ) for 30 to 60 minutes\nto help inactivate the toxin and decrease the severity of the symptoms. \n3  \n\n \n\nWhen a poisoned patient calls an ambulance , the ambulance\npersonnel should have a chance to administer early decontamination and\nantidotal treatment .\n\n\nStudies have been done on the prehospital use of activated charcoal ,\nnaloxone , and hypertonic glucose (  dextrose monohydrate ) by paramedics , and\nthey have yielded encouraging results.  4-7 \n\n\nCrockett el al  4  in their pilot study of the prehospital\nuse of activated charcoal , showed that the time for activated charcoal\nadministration could be when it is given in hospital .\n\n\nHoffman el al  6  demonstrated that it is safe to use\nnaloxone empirically in paramedic treatment protocols for patients with an\nacute loss of consciousness . \n\n \n\nIn Hong Kong , emergency medical assistants II (  EMA II ) have\nbeen trained to give antidotes of oxygen for carbon monoxide poisoning ,\nglucose 10% for hypoglycaemia , and naloxone for narcotic overdose .\n\n\nThe majority of ambulance personnel , however , are not trained to\nthe level of EMA II , and only 25% of the emergency calls are attended by EMA\nII .\n\n\nWith regard to the optimal position for transporting a poisoned\npatient to the hospital , Vance et al  8  have recommend the left\nlateral decubitus position , because this position is associated with the\nlowest initial absorption of toxin .\n\n\nThis position also offers advantages in preventing aspiration and\nenhancing oropharyngeal drainage .   \n\n\nManagement of poisoning in the accident and emergency department\n \n\n \n\nAfter arriving at the accident and emergency (  A &ampersand; E ) department\n, all significantly poisoned patients are triaged as being in a critical or\nemergency condition,  9  depending on whether they are unstable or\nnot .\n\n\nThis practice will ensure that the patients can be seen almost\nimmediately for stabilisation and consideration of early gut decontamination .\n\n\nThe mainstay of the management of poisoning is supportive - that is ,\ncare of the airway and the maintenance of breathing and the blood circulation .\n\n\nToxic symptoms such as convulsion and arrhythmia should be watched\nfor , as their onset can be quite sudden .\n\n\nIf the patient  ' s history and the results of the physical examination\nsupport toxic ingestion , gut decontamination should be considered .  \n\n\n\nGut decontamination  \n\n \n\nMuch controversy remains regarding the roles of gastric lavage,\n 10-13  emesis,  14-17  activated charcoal,  18,19\n whole-bowel irrigation,  20,21  and the use of cathartics \n22  in decontaminating the gut .\n\n\nIn view of this , the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology and\nEuropean Association of Poison Centres and Clinical Toxicologists have\npublished position statements of various gut decontamination methods.  23\n\n\n\nThese position statements are systemically developed clinical\nguidelines based on high-quality research evidence , and are summarised in\nTable 1 .\n\n\nThey are well accepted by the rest of the world , being endorsed by\nthe Canadian Association of Poison Control Centers and the American Board of\nApplied Toxicology . \n\n \n\nIn Hong Kong , gastric lavage is still commonly practiced ,\nsometimes for even minor poisoning , and it has been associated with a number\nof fatalities.  24 \n\n\nIt is based on these position statements and other literature that\nthe Coordinating Committee in A &ampersand; E Service of Hong Kong developed their\nprotocol on gastro-intestinal decontamination.  25 \n\n\nThis protocol advocates activated charcoal as the treatment of choice\nfor most poisons , except substances such as metals , alcohol , cyanide ,\nacids , and alkalis , which are not adsorbable by charcoal .\n\n\nAlthough charcoal should be given within 1 hour of ingestion of the\npoison , the protocol recommends giving the drug within the first few hours\nin  views of its safety profile and ease of administration .\n\n\nAs there have been case reports of fatal aspiration . however , an\nunprotected airway is a contra-indication for the administration of activated\ncharcoal .\n\n\nOn the other hand , the use of gastric lavage is now limited to\nlife-threatening ingestions that present within 1 hour .\n\n\nEven then , clinical benefit has not been confirmed in controlled\nstudies.  23 \n\n\nTo reduce the morbidity of the procedure , certain contra-indications\nshould be noted; they include an unprotected airway , an uncooperative\npatient , and the ingestion of corrosives or petroleum products .\n\n\nFurthermore , the proper method of gastric lavage is important in\nminimising the risk of pulmonary aspiration and oesophageal rupture (  Box ) .\n\n\nThe routine use of ipecacuanha or cathartics in the A &ampersand; E department\nis not recommended .\n\n\nWhole toxic irrigation can be considered for potentially toxic\ningestion of sustained-release or enteric coated drugs .   \n\n\nNew antibodies  \n\n \n\nIn certain poisoning , the early use of a specific antidote can\nreduce the risk of mortality and morbidity in the patient .\n\n\nSome antidotes , however , are very expensive and have adverse side\neffects .\n\n\nHence , these antidotes should be used in only severe poisonings and\naccording to strict indications , when the benefits outweigh the adverse\neffects and costs .\n\n\nUseful antidotes that are available in public hospitals in Hong Kong\nare listed in Table 2 .\n\n\nOnly the newly introduced ones are discussed below .   \n\n\n Hydroxocobalamin   \n\n \n\nHydroxocobalamin was introduced to the hospitals of the Hospital\nAuthority after an incidence of cyanide poisoning , when hypotension\ndeveloped in one of the patients; conventional antidote treatment with sodium\nnitrite was thus contra-indicated.  26 \n\n\nHydroxocobalamin is the synthesic form of vitamin B  12  ,\nwhich works by sequestering cyanide from plasma-cyanide to give non-toxic\ncyanocobalamin .\n\n\nThe adverse effects are minimal - namely , brown coloration of body\nfluids , nausea , and vomiting .\n\n\nHypertension and muscle spasms may also be observed .\n\n\nThe initial dose is 5 g of reconstituted solution given over 30\nminutes Subsequent doses , if the severity of poisoning so indicates , should\nbe given more slowly over 2 hours .    \n\n\nStonefish antevenene   \n\n \n\nThe stonefish is a coral fish that has been venom glands on its\n13 dorsal spines .\n\n\nAs stonefish are becoming increasingly popular in seafood restaurants\n, poisonous stingings of kitchen staff and fishmongers are increasingly\ncommon .\n\n\nThe venom is one of the most potent toxins known and causes immediate\nintense pain , numbness , and swelling .\n\n\nSystemic effects include delirium , convulsion , hypotension ,\narrhythmia , and pulmonary oedema .\n\n\nEmergency management includes immersion in hot water (  at 45\u00b0C ) to\ninactivate the toxin and the administration of potent alangesics .\n\n\nStonefish antevenene , recently stocked in the A &ampersand; E department of\nmost hospitals , is indicated of pain and oedema is severe or when there is\nsystemic manifestation .\n\n\nOne ampoule of 2000 units should be given for the injury from one or\ntwo spines .\n\n\nBecause the antevenene is prepare from horse serum , anaphylaxis and\ndelayed serum sickness may develop .    \n\n\nSnake antevenenes   \n\n \n\nSome snake antevenenes are available in Hong Kong and the\nCoordinating Committee in A &ampersand; E Services has published a protocol for the\nmanagement of snake bites,  27  which includes the indications and\nprecautions for the proper use of antivenenes .\n\n\nThe majority of snake bites in Hong Kong are by bamboo snakes (  \nTrimeresurus albolabris   ) .\n\n\nMost of these bites are mild and do not require antevenene.  28\n\n\n\nHowever , when antevenene is used , precautions need to be taken\nregarding anaphylaxis and serum sickness .\n\n\nThere is evidence that monovalent antevenene is better than\npolyvalent antevenene.  29 \n\n\nFurthermore , imported antevenenes that are specific for species\noverseas may not as good as those manufactured locally , due to venom\nvariability within individual species.  29     \n\n\nDigoxin-specific antibodies   \n\n \n\nDigoxin-specific antigen-binding fragments are indicated for\nlife-threatening arrhythmia or hyperkalaemia caused by intoxication by\ncardiac glycosides .\n\n\nImprovement of symptoms occurs within 10 minutes of injection and\npeaks at 4 hours .\n\n\nBecause the antibodies are produced in sheep , patients need to be\nmonitored for anaphylaxis and serum sickness .    \n\n\nEsmolol hydrochloride   \n\n \n\nEsmolo hydrochloride is a short-acting cardioselective\nbeta-adrenoceptor blocking drug that has no sympatho-minetic activity .\n\n\nThis drug is useful for controlling hypertension and tachyarrhythmia\ndue to excessive sympathominetic activity following an overdose of a central\nnervous system stimulant .\n\n\nGiven in an infusion , esmolol is better than propranolol , because\nits half-life of only 9 minutes allows rapid titration of the therapeutic\neffect .\n\n\nContra-indications include hypotension , bradycardia , and a history\nof asthma .    \n\n\nOctreotide   \n\n \n\nOctreotide is a synthetic polypeptide that antagonises pancreatic\ninsulin .\n\n\nIt is indicated for the treatment of sulphonylurea-induced\nhypolycaemia if the blood glucose level cannot be maintained by intravenously\ninfusing glucose 10% .    \n\n\nNew antibodies that are not available in Hong Kong   \n\n \n\nBotulism or botulinum antitioxin was developed from\nequine-derived antibodies against the toxin of  Clostridium botulinum\n .\n\n\nIt is used to treat clinical botulism to prevent the progression of\nneurological complications . Succimer (  2,3-dimercaptousccinic acid ) is a\nchelating agent that is used to treat lead , mercury , and arsenic poisoning;\nit is the water-soluble analogues of dimercaprol and can be taken orally .\n\n\nFomepizole (  4-methypyrazole ) is a potent competitive inhibitor of\nalcohol dehydrogenase and prevents the formation of toxic metabolites\nfollowing methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning; it is preferred to ethanol\nas an antidote because it does not cause sedation .\n\n\nNalmefene and naltrexone are long-acting opioid antagonists that are\nused to manage opioid dependence; they are more potent than naloxone but much\nmore expensive .   \n\n\nThe  ' golden hour ' concept of gut decontamination  \n\n \n\nIn the treatment of trauma patients , there is the  ' golden hour'\nconcept,  30  whereby the first hour represents the best chance to\nstabilise and treat potentially life-threatening injuries before the patient  ' s\ncondition deteriorates .\n\n\nIn the management of ingested poisons , a similar concept should\nalso be emplasised , after the first hour , the amount of poison removed from\nthe body is much decreased .\n\n\nMedical personnel who care for poisoned patients should keep this\nconcept in mind - that is , to consider early decontamination after the\noverdose , perfectly within the first hour .\n\n\nThe poisons information centre should extend its service to the\npublic by providing advice for emesis in indicated cases .\n\n\nThe administration of activated charcoal should be added to the list\nof drug protocols for the use of EMA II , preferably in consultation with\nemergency physicians via radio-communication .\n\n\nAfter arriving at the emergency department , poisoned patients\nshould be given high priority .\n\n\nWith the aid of immediate computer access to a poison index at all A\n& E departments , doctors can male an early decision about gut\ndecontamination .\n\n\nThis should reduce the time since ingestion and enable hut\ndecontamination to be done within the  ' golden hour ' .   \n\n\nConclusion  \n\n \n\nEmergency physicians should take a more active role in the\nemergency management of poisoning , not only in the A &ampersand; E department , but\nalso in the prehospital setting , where early decontamination and antidote\ntreatment can be initiated if necessary .\n\n\nWith the early use of appropriate gut decontamination methods ,\nproper use of antidotes , and better supportive care , the risk of mortality\nfrom poisoning will greatly decrease and most patients will return to society\nwith minimal disability .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "64767132-e488-46fc-817c-53035f303844", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.086291+00:00"}

Equipment is defined as a radiocommunication\napparatus designed or adapted for the purpose of controlling ( other\nthan by means of telephony ) the movement of a model vehicle , vessel\nor aircraft or a model of any other type by means of the emission of\nelectromagnetic energy from that apparatus and the reception of such energy\nby the receiving apparatus in the model .  \n\n\nReason for Licensing of Model Control Equipment \n\n \n\nA frequency band , 26.96 MHz to 27.28 MHz , and two other\nfrequencies , 72.08 MHz and 72.96 MHz , have been assigned for the operation\nof model control equipment in Hong Kong .\n\n\nWithout placing some limitation on the technical performance of the\ndevice operating on these frequencies , harmful interference may be caused to\nother authorised users of the frequency spectrum .\n\n\nTherefore , the government needs to exercise control by licensing .\n\n\n \n\nThe Telecommunication Ordinance ( Cap. 106 ) and\nits Telecommunication Regulations provide that any person in Hong Kong\nwishing to possess , trade , establish and maintain and use a model control\nequipment , is required to obtain a Model Control Licence issued by the\nTelecommunications Authority . However , with effect from 1981 , a large\nnumber of model control equipment have been exempted by law from licensing\n\n\n( See paragraph below ) .  \n\n\nModel Control Equipment Which Are Exempt from Licensing \n\n \n\nThe Telecommunication ( Model Control Equipment )\n( Exemption from Licensing ) Order 1981 provides that no person\nin Hong Kong shall be required to apply for or hold a licence granted by the\nTelecommunications Authority to cover the possession , use or dealings in\nmodel control equipment if they comply with ALL the following conditions:\n\n\nA. The operating frequency shall be within the frequency band 26.96\nMHz to 27.28 MHz .\n\n\nB. The operating radio frequency determining element is sealed so\nthat it cannot be adjusted .\n\n\nC. The maximum mean power of the emission does not exeed 0.5 watt .\n\n\nD. Emission is confined within a 20 kHz band centred on the carrier\nfrequency .\n\n\nThe strength of the electric field of the spurious emission produced\nby the model control equipment shall not exceed 500 &mu;V/m measured at a\ndistance of three metres from the model control equipment . \n\n \n\nIt is important to note that although exempted from licensing ,\nany person using model control equipment specified in the above paragraph is\nlegally bound to comply with the following conditions:\n\n\nA. The equipment must be made available for inspection , if so\nrequired , by duly authorised officers of the Telecommunications Authority .\n\n\nB. The equipment shall not be caused undue interference with any\nother authorised telecommunication apparatus or system .\n\n\nC. Any direction given by the authority for the purpose of avoiding\nsuch interference must be observed .  \n\n\nThe Model Control Licence and Licence fee \n\n \n\nAll owners ( other than licensed radio dealers ) of\na licensable model control equipment are required to obtain a Model Control\nLicence from the Office of the Telecommunications Authority at 29/F. , Wu\nChung House , 213 Queen  ' s Road East , Wan Chai , Hong Kong .\n\n\nThe transmitting apparatus ( with batteries ) and the\nHong Kong Identity Card or passport of the applicant should be made available\nfor inspection .\n\n\nThe annual fee for this licence is &dollar;55 . \n\n \n\nA licence would normally be issued within 14 days after the date\nof receipt of the requisite licence fee .  \n\n\nLicence Conditions \n\n \n\nLicensees are bound legally to observe all the conditions\nspecified in the licence .\n\n\nThe principal ones are detailed as follows :\n\n\nA. The licensed apparatus shall be operated only ( i )\nby the licensee personally or ( ii ) in the presence of and\nunder the direct supervision of the licensee , by any other person authorised\nby him .\n\n\nB. The apparatus shall not cause any interference with any other duly\nlicensed or authorized telecommunications .\n\n\nC.

{"text": "THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE CORPORATIZATION OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERY IN\nHONG KONG    \n\n\nPeter Po Yuen    \n\n\nIntroduction  \n\n \n\nThe Hong Kong Hospital Authority has been formally established\nwith the enactment of the Hospital Authority Ordinance on July 25 , 1990 .\n\n\nThis statutory corporation will soon take over the management and\ncontrol of all public hospitals , which house approximately 90 per cent of\nthe territory  ' s hospital beds .\n\n\nGovernment hospitals have hitherto been managed and financed directly\nby a government department -; the Hospital Services Department (\npreviously called the Medical &ampersand; Health Department ) .\n\n\nSubvented hospitals have in theory been owned by voluntary\norganizations , but in practice they have been heavily subsidized and tightly\ncontrolled by the government .\n\n\nWhile many have expressed concern over the transfer arrangements for\nstaff,  and the possible increase in hospital charges under the\nHospital Authority,  little has been written on the longer term\nimpact of this transfer of ownership and responsibility from a central\ngovernment department to a public corporation .\n\n\nThis article attempts to evaluate this devolution in terms of its\nlong-range impact on the health care industry , and in particular , on the\nlevel of health care expenditure , and on the public/private sector mix in\nhealth care financing .\n\n\nIt will also suggest measures to protect the wider public interest\nafter the devolution .    \n\n\nRationale for Devolution  \n\n \n\nDoubts have been emerging for some time in many industrialized\ncountries about the benefits of an expanding public sector in health care\ndelivery.  The escalation in the costs of health care , slower\neconomic growth , and government budget deficits have compelled many\ngovernments to put more emphasis on cost-containment.  \n\n\nIn the mid-1980s , a number of politicians in Hong Kong began\nadvocating the expansion of the private sector as a way of increasing supply\nwithout incurring additional costs to the public sector.  \n\n\nIt was within such a context that the concept of a Hospital Authority\nwas proposed .  \n\n \n\nThe reasons given by the government in the establishment of an\nindependent hospital authority outside the civil service are outlined in the\n1985 Scott Report,  the 1989 Provisional Hospital Authority\nReport,  and the speech by the Secretary for Health and Welfare\nto the Legislative Council in April 1990.  \n\n\nThey can be summarized as follows: ( 1 ) Greater\nflexibility , especially in dealing with personnel matters -; such as\nsalary scales , hiring and firing , the use of part-timers , and allowing\npublic hospital doctors to be engaged in private practice &semi; ( 2\n) Better integration of government and subvented hospital services .\n\n\nThis would help to raise the occupancy rate in subvented hospitals\nand reduce the overcrowding conditions in some government regional hospitals .\n\n\nIt would also raise the morale of subvented hospital staff by\nbringing their remuneration package in line with that of their government\ncounterparts &semi; ( 3 ) Greater participation by other major\nstakeholders of the health care system ( besides the government\n) -; voluntary organizations , professional bodies , academic\ninstitutions , and community groups -; through membership of the Hospital\nAuthority and its committees &semi; and ( 4 ) Incentives for\nbetter management through devolution and financial independence at the\nHospital Authority level , and decentralization and financial autonomy at the\nhospital level .  \n\n \n\nInstead of proposing specific solutions to the numerous problems\nencountered in individual hospitals or by individual professional groups ,\nthe consultants , and subsequently the Provisional Hospital Authority chose\nto recommend only a framework or operating system which , in their opinion,\nwould  \" of itself be in a position to address the various\nproblems effectively as they arose. &rdquo;    \n\n\nMembers of the public have been asked to believe that things will be\nbetter after the establishment of the Hospital Authority .  \n\n\nWhile most would agree that some structural and process changes are\nnecessary to bring about improvements , the government , however , has either\noverlooked or ignored the possibility that a new set of problems would arise\nas a direct consequence of the dismantling of the existing organizational and\nfinancing structures .    \n\n\nThe Strength of The Existing System  Few would disagree that\nparticipation , integration , decentralization , autonomy and flexibility are\ndesirable attributes for any organizational system. However , the performance\nof a system must ultimately be judged in terms of its output , and not by its\nstructures and processes .\n\n\nThe output indicators of the existing health care system are\nremarkable .\n\n\nLife expectancy at birth in Hong Kong , for instance , is higher than\nin many advanced countries &semi;\n\n\nthe infant mortality rate is also good by industrialized nations'\nstandards\n\n\n( see Table 1 ) .\n\n\nThe amount of money spent on health care , however , is one of the\nlowest among industrialized countries ( see Table 2 ) .\n\n\nFrom a cost-effectiveness point of view , the existing health care\nsystem in Hong Kong must be regarded as laudable .    \n\n \n\nThe system is also not unresponsive to changing demands .\n\n\nDespite frequent outcries from staff and on facilities shortages ,\nthe ratio of doctors to every one thousand population and the number of\nhospital beds per one thousand population have constantly improved over the\npast decades ( see Table 3 ) .  \n\n \n\nA comparative review of the health care systems of other\nindustrialized countries with free economies  suggests that\nthe existing structure for the financing and delivery of hospital services in\nHong Kong is , to a large extent, responsible for this relative\ncost-effectiveness .\n\n\nThe pertinent factors are: a fixed salary structure for doctors\nworking in public hospitals &semi; the direct financing and delivery of\nservices by the central government &semi; and the nature of the political\nsystem .    \n\n\n<It> Fixed Salary for Public Hospital Doctors    \n\n \n\nDoctors in the public sector in Hong Kong are all salaried\nemployees , and they deliver 90 per cent of the most expensive hospital\nservices .\n\n\nMany doctors in the West are compensated on a fee-for-service\nbasis,  which is more conducive to over-utilization and hence\nmore inflationary .\n\n\n\n     \n\n\n<It> Services Financed and Delivered Directly by the Central\nGovernment    \n\n \n\nHong Kong is probably the only non-socialist industrialized\ncommunity that finances the bulk of hospital services from general taxation ,\nand delivers them directly through a central government department without\nany formal cooptation of citizens and/or interest groups into the management\nprocess. The hospitals come under a tight civil service system of financial\ncontrols.      \n\n\n<It> No Direct Democracy    \n\n \n\nHong Kong does not yet have a directly elected legislature .\n\n\nThe Hong Kong government is therefore not subjected to the same\ndegree of spending pressures that confront the governments of many democratic\ncountries .  \n\n \n\nSome have attributed the low health spending and good health\nindicators in Hong Kong to factors other than the health care system -\nculture ( life style ) , smaller percentage of elderly\npopulation , and so on .\n\n\n\n Time-series data taken over the past two decades in\nHong Kong , however , do not support these arguments .\n\n\nTable 4 shows that the Infant Mortality Rate and the Maternity\nMortality Rate ( both of these health indicators are highly sensitive\nto the effectiveness of the health care system ) in Hong Kong improved\nsteadily over time given a relatively fixed cultural context , and a growing\nelderly population .\n\n\nThe evidence tends to suggest that it is the health care system\nrather than the alleged contextual factors that are mostly responsible for\nthe good health status of the population .      \n\n\nCost Escalation As A Result of Corporatization  \n\n \n\nThe transfer of management and control of public hospitals from a\ncentral government department to a quasi-autonomous non-governmental\norganization ( QUANGO ) could result in serious cost-escalation\nbecause of a number of reasons to be explored in the following paragraphs .\n\n   \n\n\n<It> The Dismantling of the Tight Civil Service System of Financial\nControls    \n\n \n\nThe set of elaborate civil service controls over capital ,\npersonnel and other recurrent expenditures will be made non-obligatory under\nthe Hospital Authority .\n\n\nThe Hospital Authority can create positions with much better packages\nof remuneration than that offered in the civil service .\n\n\nThe government , with its capital expenditure control procedures ,\nhas , up to now, been rather successful in containing the proliferation\nwithin the public sector of hi-tech medical technology , 16 which has been\ndemonstrated to be a major factor responsible for health care cost-escalation .\n\n \n\n\nDiffusion of expensive medical equipment is more likely to happen\nwith the Hospital Authority under which purchasing decisions will no longer\nbe subjected to government regulatory controls .\n\n\nAlternative control systems , such as legislation on restricting the\nsupply of equipment and facilities ,  binding fee schedules ,\n\n peer review/case -; mix management using diagnosis\nrelated groups ( DRGs ) ,  are either grossly\ninadequate or totally non-existent .\n\n\nThe development of these systems requires expertise and time , and\nwill be very unpopular with the medical community .\n\n\nMoreover , the efficacy of such systems in containing health care\ncosts is still inconclusive .  \n\n\nThe establishment of the Hospital Authority in 1990 would , in\nreality , mean the dismantling of the existing civil service financial and\nprocedural control systems without any effective alternative systems in place .\n\n   \n\n\n<It> Institutionalized Participation of Citizens and Special Interest\nGroups    \n\n \n\nThe Hospital Authority , comprising representatives of\nprofessional groups, community leaders , and high-powered businessmen , will\nbe much more likely , and will be in a much more powerful position , to\nbargain for more resources from the Finance Branch than the present Director\nof Hospital Services .\n\n\nSome Hospital Authority members might be members of the Executive\nCouncil .\n\n\nwhich ultimately makes all policy decisions on public expenditure .\n\n\nOthers might also have access to the governor through different\nchannels .\n\n\nThe current Director of Hospital Services has to rely on the\nSecretary for Health and Welfare and the Chief Secretary to speak on his\nbehalf .\n\n\nAs a civil servant , he is also more junior in rank than the\nFinancial Secretary , who makes all the initial budgetary allocations .  \n\n \n\n\n<It> Financial Independence    \n\n \n\nJust like any other government department , all revenue currently\nreceived by the Hospital Services Department from fees and other sources goes\ndirectly to the government Treasury .\n\n\nThere is little incentive for the department to increase charges or\nto find new ways to raise revenue .\n\n\nThe department must keep spending within budgetary limits .\n\n\nMedical and health expenditure as a percentage of overall public\nexpenditure has remained fairly constant over the past decades .  \n\n\nAs a public corporation , the Hospital Authority enjoys financial\nindependence , and is allowed to retain whatever income it receives. In the\nevent of inadequate funding from the government , the Hospital Authority can\nraise charges , admit more private patients or raise money through other\nmeans .\n\n\nThe need to contain spending is less pressing under the Hospital\nAuthority .    \n\n\n<It> Corporatization without Competition    \n\n \n\nThere is clear evidence to show that privatization or\ncorporatization can result in greater efficiency and lower cost if and only\nif the privatized or corporatized entity is faced with competitive pressures .\n\n \n\n\nThere are no indications that elements of competition will be\ninjected into the new system .\n\n\nThe inclusion of subvented hospitals into an integrated structure\nsuggests that the reverse might be true .    \n\n\n<It> Power Play by Special Interest Groups    \n\n \n\nThe devolution creates a golden opportunity for different special\ninterest groups to assert themselves .\n\n\nUnions will reject all bridge-over arrangements unless the terms of\nservice offered by Hospital Authority are substantially better than what is\ncurrently being offered by the government .\n\n\n\n They will also seize the opportunity to press for\nbetter working conditions .\n\n\nStaff from subvented hospitals have fought and won HK&dollar;600 million\nworth of additional fringe benefits annually .\n\n\n\n Senior officials who are likely to be leading\npositions in the new structure will continue to lobby for the creation of\nmore powerful posts with attractive remunerations .    \n\n\n<It> Environmental Factors    \n\n \n\nThe devolution takes place at a time when a number of external\nfactors have created a situation which makes cost-containment difficult .\n\n\nThe first factor is the high rate of economic growth of Hong Kong\nover the past decades .  \n\n\nMany studies have shown that the income elasticity of demand for\nhealth services is greater than 1.27 This means that the demand for more and\nbetter health care services is on the increase in Hong Kong .\n\n\nThe second consideration is the move towards a more representative\ngovernment .\n\n\nDirect elections to the Legislative Council will be in traduced in\nthe later part of 1991, creating , for the first time in Hong Kong ,\npoliticians who will have to submit themselves for re-election by the general\npublic .\n\n\nThe pressure on the government to spend more on social services will\nbe greater than before .\n\n\nThe third factor is the growth in the elderly population .\n\n\nThe recent draft White paper on Social Welfare estimated that the\nelderly population would rise from 721,600 in 1989 to 959,600 in 1999.23\nStudies have shown that per capita health expenditures for the elderly are\nbetween 1.7 to 5.5 times the spending for the non-elderly , with a\nsixteen-country average of 4.0.  \n\n\nLastly , there is the ever-increasing complexity , sophistication and\ncosts of medical technology and procedures .\n\n\nComputerized tomographical scanners ( CTs ) , magnetic\nresonance imaging ( MRIs ) , extracorporeal shock wave\nlithotripsy ( ESWL ) , coronary by-pass surgery , organ\ntransplants and so on are being adopted and diffused at a very rapid rate\nthroughout the industrialized world.  \n\n\nThe impact of hi-tech medicine on health care expenditures is bound\nto be felt in Hong Kong as well .  \n\n \n\nThe above mentioned factors suggest a clear prognosis for the\nHospital Authority: Health Expenditures Will Go Up .\n\n\nThe Secretary for Health and Welfare has estimated that the\nadditional expenditure for the setting up of the Hospital Authority will be\n\n&dollar;1,000 million per annum.  \n\n\nThis only includes expenses for ( 1 ) the establishment\nof the headquarters &semi; ( 2 ) the implementation of\nmanagement reforms &semi; and ( 3 ) the inclusion of staff in\nsubvented hospitals into the Hospital Authority  ' s remuneration package .\n\n\nThis does not include additional expenditures arising from future\nchanges in the salary structure of the Authority , nor does it include\nexpenses relating to improvement of services to patients .    \n\n\nImplications of the Increase in Health Expenditure  \n\n \n\nThe increase in the overall health expenditure has a number of\nimplications. Either taxes have to go up to finance the increase or resources\nhave to be diverted from other services such as education , housing and\nwelfare .\n\n\nAlternatively , the Hospital Authority may have to expand its\ncost-recovery measures -; raising fees  or treating more\nfee-paying private patients .\n\n\n\n A third possibility is for the government to find or\nexpand on alternative financing mechanisms such as private health insurance\nor insurance schemes managed by a public body .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "130324b3-95ee-4f72-915b-ca4884b94145", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.092794+00:00"}
{"text": "Educated guesswork  \n\n \n\nWith all their expensive gizmos , the Hong Kong Observatory team\njust haven't been making the right calls lately .\n\n\n Ella Lee  joins the weathermen to see why their recent\npredictions on typhoon behaviour have created a storm of their own \n\n \n\n THE DAILY WEATHER-FORECAST  conference at the Hong\nKong Observatory  ' s Tsim Sha Tsui headquarters resembled a small scientific\nmeeting .\n\n\nForecaster Wong Wai-kin stood in front of a large and colourful\nmeteorological graphic showing the track of Typhoon Toraji , newly formed\neast of the Philippines and at that stage heading towards Taiwan . \n\n \n\nFour senior scientific officers and acting assistant director for\nthe Observatory Edwin Ginn Wing-lui carefully listened and considered what\nshould be included in the weather-forecast bulletin for the next five days .\n\n\n \n\nIt was Friday afternoon , and just two days earlier , this same\nteam of government meteorologists had been severely criticized for hoisting\nthe No 8 gale-force-wind signal warning for Typhoon Yutu , which missed Hong\nKong and brought nothing more than a little rain to the SAR . \n\n \n\nBusinessmen accused the Observatory of being \" incompetent\n&rdquo; and \" irresponsible &rdquo; for raising the signal , which kept\nmost people across Hong Kong at home .\n\n\nDuring the 19 hours that the No 8 signal was hoisted , the SAR was\nclosed for business , causing a loss estimated at between &dollar;3.5 billion\nand &dollar;5 billion . \n\n \n\nBut at last Friday  ' s internal conference , the controversy was\nforgotten as the weathermen concentrated on the task at hand - evaluating the\nlikely impact of Toraji on Hong Kong . \n\n \n\nMr Wong , a scientific officer , concentrated on the complicated\ngraphics behind him .\n\n\n\" Based on the current track of Toraji , it will not hit Hong\nKong directly .\n\n\nThe coming days will be hot , and there will be some showers in the\nevening... &rdquo;\n\n\nThis time , the Observatory was right .\n\n\nOn Sunday and Monday , it issued the \" very hot weather &rdquo;\nwarning as the mercury level shot up to 35 degree Celsius . \n\n \n\nToraji followed the Observatory  ' s predicted track and swept\nacross Taiwan , packing winds of 150 kilometres per hour .\n\n\nThe storm caused the worst floods and mudslides in Taiwan for 50\nyears .\n\n\nAt least 46 people , including two police officers , were killed and\nmore than 150 went missing . \n\n \n\nTyphoon Toraji was yesterday moving northwest into the coastal\nprovince of Fujian and was expected to bring rainstorms to several provinces .\n\n\n \n\nThe Observatory  ' s correct call on Toraji shows how\nmeteorologists can be right in their forecasts , just as the Yutu experience\ntwo days earlier showed they can also be wrong . \n\n \n\nMr Ginn said the inconsistencies in weather forecasts were easier\nto understand in light of big discrepancies in the information received from\noverseas .\n\n\nIn front of a computer screen displaying satellite images of Toraji\nat the Observatory  ' s forecasting centre .\n\n\nMr Ginn pointed to several coloured lines on the map stretching from\nthe Philippines to Taiwan . \n\n \n\n\" Each line represents the forecasts made by individual\naround the world .\n\n\nThey include the authorities in Europe , Britain , the United States\nand Japan .\n\n\nYou can see how those tracks are different from each other . &rdquo;\n\n\n \n\nThe forecast track for Toraji provided by the European Centre for\nMedium Range Weather Forecast was 450 kilometres away from the one prepared\nby the US National Weather Services .\n\n\n\" Inconsistency is not uncommon , because different countries\nuse their own data and models to come up with predictions .\n\n\nThere is no single formula . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe Observatory introduced an internal audit system in 1984 to\ncompare its forecasts with what actually happens .\n\n\nThe audits showed that the weather-forecast services , which cost\nabout &dollar;190 million last year , are about 85 per cent accurate , on\naverage .\n\n\nLast year , the Observatory also extended its advance forecasts from\nfour days to five .\n\n\nIt conducts public-opinion surveys twice a year .\n\n\nAccording to the surveys , the public perceive its services to be 77\nper cent accurate - slightly up on the 72 per cent recorded a decade ago .\n\n\n \n\nBut with Typhoon Yutu , there was little accuracy .\n\n\nThe Observatory hoisted the No 8 signal about midnight on Wednesday\nmorning , even though wind speeds in Victoria Harbour had failed to reach the\nminimum speed of 63 kilometres per hour which the Observatory normally\nrequires before raising the signal .\n\n\nThe typhoon did not hit Hong Kong .\n\n\nInstead , it passed well to the south , affecting only southern\nLantau and Cheung Chau islands . \n\n \n\nThe controversy over Yutu was only part if a recent wave of\ngrievances leveled at the Observatory .\n\n\nOnly a few weeks earlier , on the afternoon of July 6 , the\nObservatory downgraded its warning signal for Typhoon Utor from No 8 to No 3\n, just as winds at Chek Lap Kok Airport were actually becoming stronger .\n\n\n \n\nAll flight landings and take-offs were cancelled for six hours ,\nand about 17,000 passengers were stranded at the airport at the peak of the\nchaos . \n\n \n\nIn 1999 , the Observatory was also criticized for being\nincompetent for failing to warn Hong Kong about the ferocity of Typhoon York\n, which killed one person and injured almost 500 . \n\n \n\nAngry business leaders are now calling on the Government to\noverhaul the storm-signal system .\n\n\nThe General Chamber of Commerce has received a flood of calls from\nmembers furious about repeated occasions when , they claimed , the No 8\nsignal was hoisted unnecessarily . \n\n \n\nChief Secretary for Administration Donald Tsang Yam-kuen has\ndefended the Observatory , saying it was better \" to be on the safe\nside\" . \n\n \n\nBut James Tien Pei-chun , Liberal Party chairman and legislator ,\nlabelled the weathermen \" incompetent\" .\n\n\n\" The Observatory made two serious mistakes in a row; the\ntaxpayers have spent so much money on it , but the forecast is so bad .\n&rdquo; \n\n \n\nMr Tien said the Observatory  ' s scientists were \"\nirresponsible &rdquo; because they had chosen the easy way out by adopting a\nvery high safety margin .\n\n\nHe said during Typhoon Yutu , the Observatory sacrificed the Hong\nKong economy for strong winds that only hit Cheung Chau . \n\n \n\n\" Why should we have to hire these highly paid civil\nservants if they only rely on the machines and take the easy way out ?\n\n\nThere is no one to monitor their performance .\n\n\nWe need to find out what is wrong with the Observatory .\n\n\nThe business cost in Hong Kong is already very high: we have already\nlost a lot over their mistakes .  \n\n \n\n Satellite images and charts plotting Typhoon Yutu  ' s\nprogress , above , can help map out a probable course , but as Yutu showed ,\nnot all typhoons are easily predictable .\n\n\nObservatory acting assistant director Edwin Ginn , left , studies\nweather information at the Observatory  ' s headquarters in Tsim Sha Tsui .\n \n\n \n\nGarrige Ho and Hong Kong Observatory \n\n \n\nMr Tien wrote to Observatory director Lam Hung-kwan on Saturday ,\nasking why the authorities in Macau and Shenzhen did not issue similar\ntyphoon warnings for Yutu . \n\n \n\nHowever , legislator Henry Wu King-cheong , representing the\nbroking sector , said the Observatory  ' s decision to hoist the No 8 signal\nfor Yutu was acceptable .\n\n\n\" As a member of the business sector , of course we want to\nminimise the economic loss during typhoons; bur as a member of the community\n, we also have to be concerned about public safety . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nVice-chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour\nUnion , Poon Siu-ping , also supported the Observatory  ' s decision regarding\nYutu , as it had taken account public safety .\n\n\nHe renewed a call for legislation to govern the working arrangements\nbetween employers and employees during typhoons and rainstorms . Currently ,\nthe Labour Department only issues guidelines to employers , urging them to\nmake arrangements in advance . \n\n \n\nThe federation surveyed more than 600 workers last week and found\nthat more than 40 per cent of them said they had no such arrangements set\ndown in their contracts . \n\n \n\nThe survey , to be released later this week , also found that\nnine out of 10 respondents supported having legislation requiring such\narrangements with employers concerning work during typhoons .\n\n\nA spokesman for the Labour Department said it would be inappropriate\nfor the Government to legislate on uniform work arrangements during bad\nweather because each industry had its own particular needs . \n\n \n\nFacing criticism from the community , Dr Lam maintained he and\nhis team had made the right decision in hoisting the No 8 signal for Yutu .\n\n\n\" You cannot say it is a mistake; we made the best forecast\nbased on the information we had at that moment . \n\n \n\n\" It would have been disastrous if we had not hoisted the\nsignal No 8 and the typhoon had made a direct hit on Hong Kong . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nDr Lam recalled how he and his team of scientific officers put\ntheir head together for two nights to monitor the typhoon .\n\n\n\" During every typhoon , we work around the clock , days and\nnights .\n\n\nOne thing is certain: we always put public safety before anything\nelse , and there is no compromise .\n\n\nI am cautious , not over-cautious . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nDr Lam , who joined the Observatory in 1970 and became its head\nin 1996 , said the equipment used by the Observatory was now \" world\nclass\" , but he added it would still be \" unrealistic &rdquo; to expect\nweather forecasts to be 100 per cent accurate . \n\n \n\nMeteorology is not an exact science .\n\n\nMy target is to be 100 per cent accurate .\n\n\nThe science cannot achieve that target at the moment , but it might\ndo so in eight or 10 years . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe current five-grade storm warning system has not been changed\nsince it was introduced in 1973 . \n\n \n\nThe system , officially called Tropical Cyclone Warning Signals ,\nis mainly based on the wind force blowing in Victoria Harbour , the central\npoint of Hong Kong . \n\n \n\nUnder the system , the Observatory will raise a No 1 signal when\nthe tropical storm is centred within 800km of Hong Kong .\n\n\nA No 8 signal will be hoisted when gale- or storm-force winds are\nexpected to blowing in Victoria harbour , with a sustained wind speed of\n63-117 km/h . \n\n \n\nDr Lam said the Observatory had conducted a thorough review in\n1999 which did not find any public desire for change . \n\n \n\n\" Until now , we still do not see a public consensus for a\nchange , although there are split views in our community .\n\n\nHong Kong people still have to get used to the existing system , and\nit would take time for them to adjust to a new one.\"\n\n \n\nHe said although the scientific criteria for hoisting signals had\nnot been changed , the warning system had been improved in various aspects .\n\n\nFor example , the Observatory can now announce that it will be\nhoisting the No 8 signal two hours before it actually does so . \n\n \n\nAlso , Internet users can click on the official Web site and\neasily get access to the wind force in different parts of Hong Kong during\ntyphoons . \n\n \n\nDr Lam said he would never bend to outside pressure when deciding\nwhether to hoist a typhoon signal .\n\n\n\" I will take those comments as motivation for improvement .\n\n\nAnd I will stick to the principle that public safety always come\nfirst . &rdquo;

{"text": "The Rehabilitation Development Coordinating Committee and the\nFuture of Services Concerning People with Disabilities in Hong Kong \n\n\n \n\nThe Rehabilitation Development Coordinating Committee (\nRDCC ) was created by the 1977 White Paper on \" Integrating the\ndisabled into the community -; a United Effort &rdquo; to coordinate\nservices concerning people with disabilities and to advise government on the\ndevelopment , implementation and principles of subvention of these services .\n\n\nIts members are all appointed by the Governor .\n\n\nThe White Paper also gave support to the creation of a new post , the\nCommissioner for Rehabilitation to coordinate , develop and supervise all\nconcerned activities . \n\n \n\nThese policy initiatives on rehabilitation administration and\ncoordination have been the foundations for the remarkable achievements of the\n1970  ' s and early 1980  ' s .\n\n\nThis period also witnessed important personal attention and support by\nthe Governor and heads of government secretariats and departments concerned\nin ensuring the effective implementation of the policy initiatives . \n\n \n\nDuring the first decade of  \nimplementation  of the 1977 White paper , official members sitting on the\nRDCC were almost all heads of secretariats and departments .\n\n\nFurthermore , the appointed Chairman was a member of both Executive\nand Legislative Councils , as well as the elected chairman of the\ncoordinating body for the non-governmental sector , the Joint Council for the\nPhysically and Mentally disabled ( Rehabilitation Division , Hong Kong\nCouncil of Social Service ) .\n\n\nDuring these years , RDCC had demonstrated high qualities of\ninitiative and leadership , and fulfilled its purposes of assisting the\ngovernment in developing a comprehensive programme of disability prevention\nand rehabilitation , i.e. the 10-year Rolling Rehabilitation Programme Plan .\n\n\nHong Kong should be pleased that the Plan has received high praise\nfrom a number of United Nations organizations and non-governmental\ninternational communities concerning disabilities . \n\n \n\nInto the 1980's a series of important world events concerning\ndisabilities have taken place .\n\n\nThese include the 1981 International Year of Disabled Persons , the\nUN Decade of Disabled Persons 1983-1992 , and the UN World \n Programme  of Action Concerning People with Disabilities .\n\n\nComplementing the significant impacts of these world events , heads\nof nations and leaders of non-governmental international organizations are\ngiving increasing personal attention in , and commitment to , implementing\nnew philosophies and programme initiatives concerning people with\ndisabilities .\n\n\nThe world is indeed moving with big steps forward in the field of\ndisability prevention and rehabilitation . \n\n \n\nAt such a time of fast world action , and at a time when Hong\nKong is in a critical stage of political transition , the RDCC , however ,\nhas shown weaknesses in maintaining a credibility and leadership that would\nmatch the expectations of the professional and disabled communities of Hong\nKong .\n\n\nOne major difficulty is the diminishing quality of participation of\ngovernment departments in RDCC .\n\n\nThe status of official representatives has changed significantly with\nheads of government secretaries and departments no longer attended committee\nmeetings in person , nor their second-in-commands .\n\n\nSuch a change indicates a silent but observable process which lowers\nthe priority of rehabilitation programmes in government secretariat and\ndepartmental operations . \n\n \n\nUnderstandably , RDCC does not have administrative authority over\ngovernment departments .\n\n\nIts effectiveness lies only in its expertise , reasoning power and\ninfluence .\n\n\nNow that its direct dialogue with major decision makers in government\nsecretaries and departments concerned is gone , it has lost the effective\ntool of direct communication .\n\n\nRDCC has to work with mid-level management to bridge time\ncommunication gap , but such arrangements have proven time consuming and\npractically ineffective .\n\n\nRegrettably the strength of RDCC in coordinating programmes\nconcerning disabled people , which cuts across over 14 government departments\nand involves around 100 non-governmental organizations , has now been much\neroded . \n\n \n\nThe close relationship between RDCC and the non-governmental\ncoordinating body , the Joint Council of the Physically and Mentally Disabled\n( Rehabilitation Division , Hong Kong Council of Social Service\n) has been another crucial factor leading to the early successes of\nRDCC .\n\n\nMember organizations of the Joint Council include service providers ,\nassociations of people with disabilities , and professional bodies .\n\n\nTogether they shoulder a very significant role in service provision\nand they are in daily contacts with people with disabilities. Moreover , over\nits 26 years of history , the Joint Council has been well recognized in the\nworld for its achievements in the field of disability prevention and\nrehabilitation .\n\n\nGiven its strong service and people bases , and its proven record of\nexperience and expertise , the institution of a formal relationship between\nthe RDCC and the Joint Council would be greatly beneficial to the Government\nand the society .\n\n\nThis can be effected by granting the Joint Council the privilege of\nnominating members to the RDCC . \n\n \n\nSince the 1980's , the government budget concerning disabilities\nprevention and rehabilitation has grown rapidly and significantly .\n\n\nThe rehabilitation budget however spreads over a large number of\ngovernmental and non-governmental organizations .\n\n\nFrom the perspective of certain government departments , the\nrehabilitation budget is but a minority item .\n\n\nAnd minority budget item may easily be overlooked or denied the\nappropriate attention .\n\n\nTherefore there is a need to identify a body to advise the Government\non its annual rehabilitation budget exercise , and to give special attention\nto the cost effectiveness and efficiency of the money spent . \n\n \n\nOne of the major functions of the post of Commissioner of\nRehabilitation is to coordinate the very diverse programmes concerning\ndisabled person .\n\n\nEffective coordination requires close cooperation among government\ndepartments and between the governmental and non-government sectors .\n\n\nExperiences of the past several years have shown that government\ndepartments are becoming less enthusiastic to initiatives taken by the\nCommissioner for effective coordination .\n\n\nSuch a regrettable situation does not come as a surprise at a time\nwhen government departments are becoming more distracted by the increasing\nnumber of public issues .\n\n\nThe situations can only be expected to get worse when some major\ngovernment programmes , such as the hospital services , are being taken over\nby the non-governmental statutory bodies .\n\n\nThere is therefore a strong need to strengthen the status of the post\nof Commissioner for Rehabilitation , so that it can command the necessary\nattention and cooperation of related government departments and statutory\nbodies . \n\n \n\nHong Kong is now preparing a new White Paper on measures\nconcerning disabled people for the 1990's and the next century .\n\n\nThis is the most appropriate time to carry out an in-depth review of\nthe functions of the RDCC so that it will be well equipped to deal with\nfuture challenges , to fulfil the objectives set by the Governor and to\nenhance its leadership and credibility .\n\n\nThe following recommendations should therefore be given full\nconsideration by the government:\n\n\n( 1 ) to encourage heads of secretaries and departments\nconcerned to attend RDCC meetings.\n\n\n( 2 ) to allow the Joint Council to nominate three\nrepresentatives to the RDCC , with at least one from its member organizations\nof disabled people and their guardians.\n\n\n( 3 ) to appoint a chairman of the RDCC from among\nmembers of the Legislative and/or Executive Council who would have a proven\nrecord demonstrating his/her devotion and commitment in the field of\ndisability prevention and rehabilitation.\n\n\n( 4 ) to allow RDCC to play an advisory role in the\npreparation of government  ' s overall rehabilitation budget as well as\nindividual departmental rehabilitation budget.\n\n\n( 5 ) to grant the Commissioner for Rehabilitation\nattendance in major budgetary and policy regular meetings chaired by the\nChief Secretary .  \n\n \n\n\n The Costs of Streaming Language Ability   \n\n\n 1. Introduction  \n\n \n\nThe Report of the Working Group Set Up to Review Language\nImprovement Measures is , perhaps , the first attempt on the part of the\nGovernment to come to grips with the very complex language situation in Hong\nKong : the relationship between Chinese and English &semi; the declining\nstandard in both English and Chinese &semi; the problems of using English as\nthe language of instruction in schools and the necessity of language planning\nin Hong Kong . \n\n \n\nIt is the intention of the author to examine the two key issues\nin the report regarding the medium of instruction and the streaming according\nto English language proficiency at Primary Six .\n\n\nThese will be analyzed on the    basis  \nof two criteria :\n\n\na -; whether the true problem (s) have been\nidentified and b -; whether workable solutions have been prescribed by\nthe report .  \n\n\n 2 .\n\n\nThe English Language in Schools  \n\n \n\nA close scrutiny of the report reveals a rather disappointing\nscenario .\n\n\nDespite its pledge to promote bilingual education , the report deals\nalmost exclusively on the teaching and the learning of English in Schools .\n\n\nThe teaching and the learning of Chinese and Putonghua are given   negligible  mentioning .\n\n\nJudging from the way the report tackles the question of bilingual\neducation , one just wonders whether this is yet another of the government  ' s\nhalf-hearted efforts in promoting bilingual abilities in Hong Kong students .\n\n\n \n\nThe question of the medium of instruction is examined within the\nreport on the basis of two premises .\n\n\nFirstly , the report claims that only 30% of the secondary\nschool population can reap cognitive benefit from English as a medium of\ninstruction &semi;\n\n\nsecondly , it holds that mixing Cantonese and English in the\nclassroom is undesirable and should be discouraged .\n\n\nThe first premise is flawed because neither is cognitive benefit\nclearly defined nor is the use of English as a medium of instruction truly\nfunctional as it is practised in Hong Kong today .\n\n\nThe second premise is highly suspicious because it is a widely agreed\nview among sociolinguists that code mixing ( or code switching\n) serves very definite social and societal purposes .\n\n\nIndeed , code mixing happens continuously around us in Hong Kong and\nin many places in the world .\n\n\nIt is neither undesirable nor unnatural .\n\n\nIt is , therefore , very perplexing to find in the report a\ncategorical denial of code mixing in the classroom . \n\n \n\nMany may think that the classroom is a place where purity of\nthought and language should be the rule .\n\n\nAlas , we have witnessed terrible failures in education resulting\nfrom such a view .\n\n\nSex education is one case in point .\n\n\nLanguage education is yet another .\n\n\nTo try to enforce purity of language use in the classroom the\neducator is , in fact , creating an artificial language context &semi; and\nall language teaching professionals agree that nothing is more damaging to\nlanguage learning than an artificial language context .\n\n\nHas the Working Group ever considered models of bilingual education\nwhere code mixing is an inherent and contributing feature ?  \n\n\n 3. The Problem with Streaming  \n\n \n\nTo resolve the medium of instruction question the Report proposes\nto stream students according to their English language ability before they\nenter secondary education .\n\n\nThose screened in will be placed in schools with English as the\nmedium of instruction &semi; those screened out will be placed in Chinese\nmedium schools .\n\n\nThis is certainly not a viable solution even granting that the\nquestion of medium of instruction should be resolved in the way the Report\nsuggests . \n\n \n\nThe mechanism proposed through which streaming is done is a\nbattery of language tests .\n\n\nIt is not clear what the function of such a test would be .\n\n\nIf it were to assess the mastery of what is in the school English\nsyllabus ( achievement ) , the question should be asked as to\nthe   extent  the school English syllabus reflects the\nEnglish in use as a medium of instruction .\n\n\nThis has still to be established .\n\n\nIf the test were to assess students  '  English ability in general\n( proficiency ) , the question should be asked as to the ways\nEnglish is taught and learnt in Hong Kong primary classrooms .\n\n\nEnglish could be learnt as a school subject like many other rather\nthan as a real language .\n\n\nIf the test were to assess natural ability for language learning\n( aptitude ) , the question should be asked as to what\nconstitutes language aptitude : a question which there is as yet no definite\nanswer .\n\n\nDue to these still unanswered questions, the suggestion to use a yet\n   undefined   language test \n  better   to do the job of streaming is premature to say the\nleast . \n\n \n\nThere is , perhaps , the question of cost effectiveness in the\nproposal of streaming .\n\n\nIt can be claimed that the limited resources for education can best\nbe deployed for those who can benefit .\n\n\nSuch a view hides in it subtle dangers .\n\n\nCost in such a view is measured in dollar terms for the government\npurse and effectiveness is in terms of the maintenance of the society as a\nwhole .\n\n\nBut cost is also measurable in human and individual terms .\n\n\nWhat does cost amount to for those screened out ?\n\n\nEven if Hong Kong may need only 30% for our primary student\npopulation to achieve a good standard of English , to give to only\n30% of the opportunity may run the risk of wasting some 20 or more\npercentage of usable talent if there was some 50% or more in the\nstudent population capable of   achieving  the same\nstandard . \n\n \n\nStreaming 70% of P.6 students out in order to allow the\nremaining 30% benefit from using English as a medium of instruction\nis , perhaps , a piece of economic planning but certainly not an educational\none .\n\n\nThe hope of success of streaming is very questionable to say the\nleast and the side-effects are too easy to see .\n\n\nTo make the best and the highest investment return of a limited\neducational budget it may be necessary to implement streaming .\n\n\nOn the other hand , in order  \" to promote bilingual\nskills in Chinese and English among all students in schools at both primary\nand secondary levels &rdquo;  , what is needed is a revision on what\nhas gone wrong in the present bilingual educational policy and instructional\npractices .\n\n\nIt is certainly perplexing to see that it is the students who are\nasked to make sacrifices .\n\n\nIf the 70% screened out will be deprived of the chance of\ndeveloping their English ability , the 30% screened in will be\ndeprived of the opportunity to develop their Chinese ability , which all\nnative Chinese speakers in Hong Kong see as needing urgent attention .\n\n\nIt is a all-lose situation .\n\n\nBilingual education deserves more than just lip-service and\nslogan-launching . \n\n \n\nOne of the most serious side-effect in streaming is its being\nelitist and socially divisive .\n\n\nThere is no common educational goal to be achieved by the students\nafter streaming .\n\n\nThe effect of streaming will remain for the rest of the formal\neducational carrier of the students -; a responsibility certainly too\nonerous for twelve/thirteen year olds .\n\n\nIt is not enough to say that there is no status difference between\nEnglish medium and Chinese medium schools .\n\n\nThe fact is that if the students and their parents had no right to\nchoose , the feeling of inequality would be all too real . \n\n \n\nThe effects of streaming on the students are not difficult to\nunderstand .\n\n\nInstead of having opportunities opening up , students realize that\noptions begin to narrow as soon as they start their secondary education .\n\n\nThe problem is that the students don't feel that they have a choice\nin their future .  \n\n\n4. Conclusion \n\n \n\nStreaming is not necessarily a bad thing , if it leads to a\ncommon educational goal and equal opportunity for all .\n\n\nWhat is being suggested in the present proposal of streaming looks\ndangerously like streaming for streaming  ' s sake with no valid bilingual\neducational objective beyond .\n\n\nIt has been argued that the present proposal on streaming has been\ndone with little serious thinking given to bilingual education as the\npractitioners know it .\n\n\nNeither is it based on truly impartial research evidence nor will it\nbe done with a fair and valid measuring instrument .\n\n\nIt seems that what the government wants is to pay for 30% of\nthe student population to have an English medium instruction &semi; and\n30% will the government take up as its responsibility .\n\n\nThis is not untypical of a paternalistic government with too keen an\neye on economic planning . \n\n \n\nHong Kong has long prided herself on what individual endeavour\ncan do to better his or her lot despite initial disadvantage due to birth or\nlost opportunities .\n\n\nDoes it not appear that it is perhaps too early to shut the door to\nequal educational opportunities to many of our twelve/thirteen year olds if\nstreaming was to be implemented .\n\n\nHong Kong may have to bit farewell to the possibility of developing\na truly bilingual community and the maintenance of that very lovable\nrestlessness which captures so well the perception that opportunities are\nalways there to grasp .\n\n\nThis is a vitality that is the envy of the world and which would be\nsuch a pity to lose .", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "3c1b4060-c4eb-4721-9f78-b5346e67bb27", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.095331+00:00"}

{"text": "HOW TO APPLY FOR REGISTERING AND LICENSING A VEHICLE \n\n\n \n\nNo vehicle is allowed to be driven or used on a road unless it is\nregistered and licensed . \n\n \n\nRegistration , which is normally a one-off matter , means giving\nthe vehicle a registration mark and putting it into its appropriate class ,\ne.g. private car , light goods vehicle , etc .\n\n\nLicensing , which is annually or four-monthly , conveys the right for\na vehicle to be driven on a road .\n\n\nA local motor vehicle agent usually applies for registration and\nlicensing of a vehicle on behalf of its client .\n\n\nHowever , if a person imports a vehicle , he has to do it himself .\n \n\n\n Registration and Taxation  \n\n \n\nVehicles , no matter whether it is a company car or not , imported\ninto Hong Kong are not subject to any Customs tax , but in general , an\nimporter is required to lodge with the Customs and Excise Department an\naccurate and complete declaration within 14 days of importation . \n\n \n\nThe import declaration can be lodged in the following ways:\n\n\n( a ) For importer already registered with Tradelink\nElectronic Commerce Ltd ( Tradelink ) as EDI customer , he can\nlodge import declaration to the Government directly from his personal\ncomputer .\n\n\n( b ) For occasional importer and individual , they can\nlodge import declarations at Tradelink  ' s service centres to convert paper\ndeclarations for EDI transmission .\n\n\nPlease call 2399 0430 for the current locations of the centres . \n\n \n\nFor further information about electronic lodgement service , or\nto register for using the service , please call Tradelink  ' s Hotline at 2599\n1700 . \n\n \n\nUnder the Motor Vehicles ( First Registration Tax )\nOrdinance ( Chapter 330 ) , a person who carries on business of\nimporting motor vehicles for use in Hong Kong either on his own behalf or for\na distributor for sale should within 30 days of commencing to carry on that\nbusiness register as an importer .\n\n\nA person who carries on business of distributing motor vehicles by\nsale for use in Hong Kong either on his own behalf or to another distributor\nshould within 30 days of commencing to carry on that business register as a\ndistributor . \n\n \n\nBesides , under the Motor Vehicles ( First Registration\nTax ) Ordinance ( Chapter 330 ) , an importer of a motor\nvehicle for use in Hong Kong should file an Import Return to the Customs and\nExcise Department within 30 days of the importation of the motor vehicle ,\nand not less than five working days before delivering that motor vehicle .\n\n\nApart from those who import motor vehicles for the purpose of sale or\ndistribution for use in Hong Kong , persons who import motor vehicles for\ntheir own use are also required to submit Import Returns .\n\n\nA registered distributor of motor vehicles for use in Hong Kong is\nrequired to publish a retail price list of the make and model of a motor\nvehicle offered for sale or distributed by him .\n\n\nHe is also required to deliver a copy of the retail price list to the\nCustoms and Excise Department not less than seven days before the publication .\n\n\n \n\nFurther information concerning registration of\nimporter/distributor , filing of Import Return and submission of Published\nRetail Price List can be obtained from the Motor Vehicles Valuation Group of\nthe Customs and Excise Department at Room 1111 , 11/F , North Point\nGovernment Offices , 333 Java Road , North Point , Hong Kong ( Tel\n2231 4390 ) . \n\n \n\nIf a person wishes to register a vehicle which he has purchased\nfrom a local distributor or has imported into Hong Kong , he must apply to\nthe Hong Kong Licensing Office of the Transport Department at 3/F , United\nCentre , 95 Queensway , Hong Kong on application form TD 22 together with\nrelevant documents as prescribed in the application form .\n\n\nDocuments not in English or Chinese should be produced together with\nan English translation prepared by a consulate . \n\n \n\nOn the first registration of a motor vehicle , a first\nregistration tax is charged , which is equal to 40-60 per cent of the vehicle  ' s\ntaxable value in the case of private cars , 40 per cent in the case of\nmotorcycles , 18 per cent in the case of goods vehicles , 40-50 per cent in\nthe case of van-type light goods vehicles not exceeding 1.9 tonnes , 20 per\ncent in the case of van-type light goods vehicles exceeding 1.9 tonnes , or 4\nper cent in the case of other vehicle classes .\n\n\nIn general , the taxable value of a vehicle is calculated on the\nbasis of the published retail price of the vehicle or the provisional taxable\nvalue assessed by the Customs and Excise Department .\n\n\nHowever , the value of any exempted accessory ( i.e.\nair-conditioning unit , anti-theft devices or audio equipment ) fitted\nand any warranty other than manufacturer  ' s warranty provided will not be\nincluded in the calculation of taxable value of the vehicle . \n\n \n\nA vehicle may be registered only in the name of an individual\nperson aged 18 or above or of an incorporated body .\n\n\nIn the case of a private firm , the vehicle must be registered in the\nname of the proprietor or principal partner .\n\n\nIf the vehicle is registered in the name of a limited company , the\nname and address of the registered office of the company should be given and\nthe declaration should be signed by a person nominated by the company . \n\n \n\nTrailers are also required to be registered in the same manner as\nmotor vehicles but with some exceptions , e.g. a trailer owner is not\nrequired to pay first registration tax , nor is he required to produce any\nthird party risk insurance certificate or cover note for his vehicle . \n\n \n\nIn registering a vehicle , the Transport Department will issue a\nregistration mark and a vehicle registration document containing particulars\nof the vehicle to the registered owner . \n\n \n\nLicensing of vehicles takes place after registration .\n\n\nOn licensing , the registering owner is issued with a licence which\nhe is required to display on the left-hand side of the vehicle  ' s windscreen .\n\n\nIn the case of a motorcycle or a vehicle without a fixed windscreen ,\nthe licence must be displayed in a conspicuous position on the left-hand side .\n\n\n \n\nThe registered owner and a registered distributor should also\ndeclare to the Hong Kong Licensing Office on application form TD 469 the\ndetails of accessories fitted by the registered distributor or an associated\nperson to the motor vehicle within three months after first registration ,\nand pay the additional first registration tax attributable to the increase in\nvalue of the motor vehicle .\n\n\nSuch declaration should be made not later than five working days\nafter the fitting of the accessories . \n\n \n\nFurther information concerning first registration of vehicles can\nbe obtained from the Hong Kong Licensing Office at 3/F , United Centre , 95\nQueensway , Hong Kong ( Tel 2804 2637 ) .  \n\n\n Allocation of Registration Marks  \n\n \n\nIf an application for registration of a vehicle is in order , the\nvehicle will be assigned a registration mark consisting of a number of not\nmore than 4 digits other than special registration mark ( commonly\nknown as &lsquo; lucky numbers &rsquo; ) , with prefix letters .\n\n\nIn the case of trailers , the registration mark will consist of a\nnumber of not more than 5 digits and the suffix &lsquo; T &rsquo; . \n\n \n\n&lsquo; Lucky numbers &rsquo; are allocated only after sale by\npublic auction which takes place from time to time .\n\n\nThe proceeds of the auction goes to the Government Lotteries Fund to\nbe used for charitable purposes . \n\n \n\nOnce allocated , a special registration mark cannot be\ntransferred to another person .\n\n\nIf the owner of a vehicle with a special registration mark wishes to\ntransfer the vehicle to someone else , the Transport Department is legally\nbound , before registering the transfer , to recover the special registration\nmark , register the vehicle with ordinary registration mark and then register\nthe transfer .\n\n\nBut , on payment of a prescribed fee , the owner of a vehicle with a\nspecial registration mark may apply on form TD 129 to transfer the special\nregistration mark to another vehicle registered in his name .  \n\n\n Traffic Accident Victims Assistance Scheme  \n\n \n\nOn the first issue/renewal of a vehicle licence , contribution\nhas to be made to the Traffic Accident Victims Assistance Scheme .  \n\n\n Vehicle Examinations  \n\n \n\nWith the exception of new private cars and motor cycles (\nbut not if they are models registered for the first time in Hong Kong\n) , all motor vehicles are subject to mechanical examination to\ncertify that they comply with the Road Traffic ( Construction and\nMaintenance of Vehicles ) Regulations , the Air Pollution Control\n( Vehicle Design Standards ) ( Emission )\nRegulations and the Noise Control ( Motor Vehicles ) Regulation\nprior to registration . \n\n \n\nIn addition , private cars aged 6 or above , all goods vehicles\nand commercial vehicles are required to undergo examination prior to\nre-licensing . \n\n \n\nAny person who uses or permits to be used on any road any vehicle\nwhich does not comply in all respects with the provisions of any enactment\nrelating to the Road Traffic ( Construction and Maintenance of\nVehicles ) Regulations shall be guilty of an offence .\n\n\nIf you are in doubt as to whether or not your vehicle does comply\nwith the laws relating to construction and maintenance , you should contact\nthe Senior Engineer/Motor Vehicle Examination at 34/F , Immigration Tower , 7\nGloucester Road , Hong Kong ( Tel 2829 5466 ) .  \n\n\n Renewal of Licence  \n\n \n\nVehicle licence may be renewed within four months before expiry\non application form TD 23/12 ( for one year ) or TD 23/4\n( for four months ) .\n\n\nIf an application is made after the expiry of the licence , the\nrenewed licence will run from the date of issue of licence .\n\n\nThe total fee paid in this case is the licence fee plus an additional\ncharge , which is 0.33 per cent of the licence fee for each day of the\nunlicensed period since the previous licence expired .  \n\n\n Duplicates  \n\n \n\nIf your vehicle registration document or licence has been lost ,\ndestroyed or defaced , you should apply for a duplicate .\n\n\nIn the case of loss of registration document , you should report to a\npolice station in the district where the loss occurred .\n\n\nWith a police certificate , you should apply to a licensing office\nfor a duplicate , using form TD 151 and paying the prescribed fee .  \n\n\n Vehicle Transfer  \n\n \n\nWithin 72 hours on the change of ownership of a vehicle , a\nnotice of transfer on form TD 25 must be lodged with the Transport Department\nlicensing office , as proof that the transferor and transferee agree to the\ntransaction .\n\n\nAs required by law , the new owner should deliver the original of the\nnotice to the Transport Department , and the former owner the duplicate .\n\n\nThere were cases in which transferees failed to take this procedure ,\nthus , no transfer is registered and the vehicle remains registered in the\nname of the former owner , to whom all fixed penalty tickets are sent .\n\n\nTherefore , it is advisable that the former owner should call at the\nlicensing office together with the new owner to hand in both portions of the\nnotice of transfer ( duly completed and signed ) so as to\neffect the transfer immediately .\n\n\n A former owner should not hand over the vehicle registration\ndocument to the new owner until the Transport Department has registered the\ntransfer .\n\n\n The new owner  ' s original identification documents should be\nproduced . \n\n \n\nWhen applying for transfer of ownership , the former owner and\nthe new owner should also declare the transaction price of the motor vehicle\non form TD 25 .\n\n\nIf the declared transaction price is greater than the last taxable\nvalue , the value of any exempted accessories , the value of any unexpired\nportion of a warranty other than a manufacturer  ' s warranty plus the first\nregistration tax paid , the former owner should apply to the Hong Kong\nLicensing Office on application form TD 468 for approval and should pay the\nadditional tax before the transfer of ownership is effected . \n\n \n\nIt is equally important for a prospective transferee to ensure\nthat there are no outstanding penalties or possible licence suspension in\nrespect of the vehicle .\n\n\nThere are numerous cases whereby a transferee finds himself legally\nliable to payment of fixed penalty tickets , or the vehicle licence is\nsuspended because the former owner has failed to disclose such information .\n\n\n To guard against this , a new owner is advised before\nacquiring a vehicle to apply to a licensing office for the relevant\nCertificate of Clearance .\n\n\nThe Certificate , issued free of charge , is valid for 72 hours and\ncertifies that the vehicle is free of outstanding penalties and is not liable\nto licence suspension .   \n\n\n Change of Registration Particulars  \n\n \n\nA registered owner is required by law to notify a licensing\noffice of the Transport Department on form TD 150 within 72 hours of any\nchange in respect of registration particulars , e.g. his name , address ,\nidentity document , or the colour , engine number , or seating capacity of\nhis vehicle , etc .\n\n\nThe vehicle registration document , and where appropriate , the\nlicence , should be submitted for amendment .  \n\n\n Application by

{"text": "Western region an ecological disaster in the making: study\n  \n\n\n Ray Cheung  \n\n \n\nA recent official study has found that human activities such as\nfarming , deforesting and mining , combined with population growth and global\nclimate change , are wrecking the fragile ecosystem in the western region .\n\n\n \n\nThe study , \" An Investigation of the Western Region  ' s\nEcological Situation\" , was carried out by the State Environmental Protection\nAgency , the Chinese Academy of Sciences and 12 provincial research centres .\n\n\n \n\nIt urges immediate measures to protect the region  ' s ecology , the\n China Youth Daily  quoted the report as saying . \n\n \n\nUsing various social , economic and scientific data up to 1999 ,\nthe study assessed various environmental indicators such as soil erosion ,\ndesertification , salination and deforestation . \n\n \n\nIt found that more than 104.3 million hectares in the region\nsuffer from serious soil erosion .\n\n\nIn some provinces , eroded land accounts for more than 50 per cent of\ntotal land area . \n\n \n\nThe western provinces of Inner Mongolia , Gansu , Ningxia ,\nShaanxi , Tibet and Xinjiang now have more than 162 million hectares of\ndesert , while the regions of Chongqing , Sichuan , Yunnan and Guizhou have\n7.2 million hectares of salinised land . \n\n \n\nForests and grasslands have been destroyed as a result of their\nconversion into arable land .\n\n\nFrom 1986 to 1999 , grasslands decreased 69.5 per cent , while\nforests decreased 22 per cent . \n\n \n\nThe authors believe that the destruction has led to a cycle of\necological disasters such as increased soil erosion , plant diseases , rodent\noutbreaks , water table shrinkage and the alkalification of lake and river\nwater . \n\n \n\nThe report says that from the 1980s to the 1990s , natural\ndisasters such as sand storms and floods doubled . \n\n \n\nPopulation growth and economic development have upset the region  ' s\necological balance . \n\n \n\nThe report notes environmentally destructive activities such as\nmining have more than doubled since 1986 . \n\n \n\nMore than 1.8 million hectares of land are used for mining in the\nprovinces of Qinghai , Shaanxi , Ningxia and Inner Mongolia alone . \n\n \n\nThe report alludes to the Government  ' s attempt to protect the\nregion by raising environmental standards . But it says \" there is a\nhuge gap between what can be realistically monitored and managed\" . \n\n \n\nThe report urges local authorities to take immediate measures\nsuch as promoting less environmentally destructive economic activities like\nsmall-scale farming and herding . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n US waste ` dumped ' on mainland   \n\n\n Report says toxic wiring and computer parts damaging health\nand making water undrinkable   \n\n\n Ray Cheung  \n\n \n\nHighly toxic wiring and computer waste shipped from the United\nStates is seriously damaging China  ' s environment and mainlanders ' health ,\naccording to an international report . \n\n \n\nThe report ,  Exporting Harm: The High-Tech Trashing of Asia\n , estimates that up to 80 per cent of all electronic waste originating\nfrom the US is exported to Asia . \n\n \n\nThis is estimated to be about 100 million waste computer parts .\n\n\nChina is the main destination followed by India and Pakistan . \n\n \n\nThe report was written by the US-based Basel Action Network and\nSilicon Valley Toxics Coalition , Toxics Link India , Greenpeace China and\nthe Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment in Pakistan , who\nfocused their investigation on an electronic waste recycling centre in the\nGuiyu region of Guangdong near the Lian River .\n\n\nThey found serious environmental and health damage . \n\n \n\nInvestigators witnessed men , women and children involved in the\nhazardous practice of burning plastics , wire and soldered circuit boards in\nthe open and cracking and dumping toxic lead-laden cathode-ray tubes . \n\n \n\nThe waste was being dumped along rivers , in open fields and\nirrigation canals in rice , making local water undrinkable . \n\n \n\nWater now has to be trucked in from 30km away . \n\n \n\nWhile it blamed the conditions partly on China  ' s lax\nenvironmental laws , the report placed its chief responsibility on the United\nStates . \n\n \n\n\" They call this recycling , but it  ' s really dumping by\nanother name . \n\n \n\n\" Yet to our horror , we further discovered that rather\nthan banning it , the United States Government is actually encouraging this\nugly trade to avoid finding real solutions to the massive tide of obsolete\ncomputer waste generated in the US daily , &rdquo; Jim Puckett , the report\nco-ordinator , said .  \n\n \n\n Women in Guiyu , Guangdong , sit through waste computer\nwiring .\n\n\nThe report says people burn plastics and circuit boards in the open\nand dump toxic materials in rivers and irrigation canals . \n\n\nAP \n\n \n\nThe report said the US was the only developed country in the\nworld that had failed to ratify the Basle Convention , a United Nations\nenvironmental treaty which has adopted a global ban on the export of\nhazardous wastes from the world  ' s most developed countries to developing\nones . \n\n \n\nThe US had actually exempted toxic electronic waste from its own\nlaws governing exports because the material was claimed to be destined for\nrecycling . \n\n \n\nThe US-based National Science Foundation estimated that between\n1997 and 2004 , the US would generate more than 315 million obsolete computer\nparts . \n\n \n\nThe problem is growing and the report urged the US to implement\nan immediate global ban on the export of hazardous wastes and mandate the\nelectronics industry to institute take-back recycling programmes and phase\nout the use of toxic substances in the equipment . \n\n\n\n \n\n\n Deadly parasites in water source   \n\n\n Study finds cancer-causing dioxin and huge numbers of stomach\nbugs in Dongjiang river   \n\n\n Cheung Chi-fai  and  Quinton Chan  \n\n \n\nHigh concentrations of potentially deadly parasites and a small\namount of cancer-causing dioxin have been found in water and sediment from\nthe Dongjiang river - the source of most of Hong Kong  ' s drinking water .\n\n\n \n\nThe findings by the Open University follow the disclosure last\nweek by the Water Supplies Department that low levels of two parasites -\ngiardia and cryptosporidium - had been found in three samples of treated Hong\nKong water over the past three years . \n\n \n\nTests by the university found the parasites were present in 40\nper cent of raw water samples taken from the Dongjiang and three local\nreservoirs .\n\n\nThe bugs can cause serious intestinal diseases and even kill people\nwith weak immune systems .\n\n\nSmall quantities of dioxin were also found for the first time in\nDongjiang sediment . \n\n \n\nResearchers found up to one million cryptosporidium and 10,000\ngiardia specimens per litre of water in the most polluted Dongjiang tributary\nin Sima , Guangdong .\n\n\nAt Plover Cove and Shek Pik reservoirs , up to 100,000\ncryptosporidium and 10,000 giardia per litre were discovered . \n\n \n\nResearch team leader Dr Ho Kin-chung said the results had\nworrying long-term health implications , despite the team  ' s failure to\ndetect the parasites in treated water samples . \n\n \n\n\" The findings raise concern over the long-term health risk\nto people as we have found the parasites existing almost everywhere along the\ntributary , &rdquo; he said .\n\n\n\" We cannot always rely on the treatment plants to deal with\nthis rising problem .\n\n\nIt cannot be reliable all the time . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe team  ' s findings are in sharp contrast to test results from\nthe Water Supplies Department , which suggested only low levels of the\nparasites were present in Dongjiang water from the Muk Wu Pumping Station ,\nthe first point on the river from which water is diverted to Hong Kong . \n\n \n\nIt found just seven out of 38 raw samples were contaminated\nbetween November 1999 and February this year . \n\n \n\nLevels ranged from 0.29 to 0.8 specimens per litre for\ncryptosporidium and 0.04 to 5.88 for giardia . \n\n \n\nAlthough there is no internationally accepted safety limit for\nthe parasites , the British standard for cryptosporidium is 0.1 specimens per\nlitre . \n\n \n\nEvidence that treatment did not totally eliminate the bugs\nemerged with the disclosure that three treated samples were found with\ncryptosporidium in April and August 1999 and in December 2000 , at treatment\nplants in Sha Tin and Au Tau .\n\n\nNone exceeded the British treatment standard and were not a health\nconcern , the department said . \n\n \n\nThe Dongjiang tributary , which runs through several Guangdong\ncities , channels water to the SAR .\n\n\nApart from Shek Pik , Plover Cove and Shing Mun reservoirs , all\nothers contain water imported from Guangdong . \n\n \n\nDr Ho , also a member of the Advisory Committee on Quality of\nWater Supplies , urged the Government to expand raw water monitoring both in\nthe Dongjiang and local reservoirs .\n\n\nHowever , a spokesman for the department played down the significance\nof the university findings and emphasised that Hong Kong drinking water was\nsafe .  \n\n \n\n Crytosporidium (  left ) and giardia parasites can cause\nserious intestinal diseases or even death .  \n\n \n\n\" All natural streams , rivers and even underground water\nmight contain such parasites .\n\n\nThere is no surprise and no big deal about that , &rdquo; he said ,\nadding it was not a problem if the water was treated . \n\n \n\nAt present , only six of the SAR  ' s 20 treatment plants are\nequipped to test for the parasites . \n\n \n\nDeputy director of the Conservancy Association Lister Cheung Lai-\nping , another water advisory committee member , said the tests results made\na mockery of the department  ' s goal of providing water that was safe to drink\nstraight from the tap . \n\n \n\n\" If we are heading to the target of direct consumption ,\nthe Government needs to further monitor the parasite level of Dongjiang water\n, &rdquo; she said . \n\n \n\nHoward Liu Hung-to , Greenpeace campaign director , was shocked\nto learn that dioxin was found in the sediment .\n\n\n\" Even though only a small amount was found , it still\nindicates that the dioxin contamination along the river had been very serious\n, as the dilution in the river water should have removed most of it . &rdquo;\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Officials dismiss EU bar on mainland foods   \n\n\n Klaudia Lee  \n\n \n\nHealth officials say food products imported from the mainland are\nsafe despite bans imposed by the European Union , which claims they contain\npotentially hazardous antibiotics and chemicals . \n\n \n\nFood products ranging from honey to frozen chicken were banned by\nthe EU in January after tests revealed them to contain potentially harmful\ntoxins . \n\n \n\nHong Kong has also banned many of the substances found , but\nofficials said their test results contradicted the EU  ' s and they found no\ntraces of harmful chemicals . \n\n \n\nThey also said the mainland claimed the EU report into the\nallegedly tainted foods was inaccurate and exaggerated the situation . \n\n \n\nThe difference of opinion has prompted calls for a stepping up of\nHong Kong  ' s food sampling procedures and a claim by a legislator that the EU\nban may be politically motivated . \n\n \n\nIn a written reply to legislators last week explaining the\nsituation , Secretary for the Environment and Food Lily Yam Kwan Pui-ying\nsaid despite the EU ban , no antibiotics had been detected in foodstuffs\nimported from the mainland over the past three years .  \n\n \n\nDemocrat Fred Li Wah-ming said Hong Kong need not follow the EU\n's lead to impose the food ban as the EU action could be politically\nmotivated . \n\n \n\nThe EU made the decision after an inspection team found in\nNovember last year that prohibited antibiotics and beta-blockers , such as\nchloramphenicol and clenbuterol , were widely used on some mainland farms .\n\n\n \n\nReports of chloramphenicol being detected in samples of mainland\nshrimps or prawns have been made repeatedly by EU member states since August\nlast year , according to an EU inspection report . \n\n \n\nChloramphenicol is a potent , broad-spectrum antibiotic , banned\nfor use in food-producing animals in the EU since 1994 .\n\n\nThe effects of the drug on humans can include bone-marrow depression .\n\n\n \n\nThe EU banned the use of clenbuterol in producing livestock in\n1996 after it was found that people who consumed the chemical suffered an\nincreased heart rate , headaches and a reduction in blood pressure . \n\n \n\nBoth chemicals are banned in Hong Kong . \n\n \n\nAmong foods banned by the EU are honey , frozen chicken meat ,\nfrozen rabbit meat , frozen shrimps and frozen crabs .\n\n\nIn all , 499,266 tonnes of these food products have been imported\ninto Hong Kong over the past three years . \n\n \n\nMrs Yam said the Government has contacted the EU office in Hong\nKong and the mainland  ' s State General Administration for Quality Supervision\nand Inspection and Quarantine . \n\n \n\nMainland authorities said the inspection report was inaccurate\nand exaggerated the seriousness of the issue . \n\n \n\nJuan Victor Monfort , first counsellor for Trade and Economic\nAffairs at the European Union office in Hong Kong , said EU representatives\nwould continue discussions with China about the lifting of the bans . \n\n \n\nHowever , he said the EU could not ask the Hong Kong Government\nto impose the ban and that \" it  ' s up to the HK Government to make its\nown decision\" . \n\n \n\nIn her reply , Mrs Yam said since the Public Health (  Animals and\nBirds ) (  Chemical Residues ) Regulation and Harmful Substances in Food ( \nAmendment ) Regulation 2001 came into effect on December 31 last year , no\nantibiotics had been found in the food samples , including the 64 samples of\nproducts imported from the mainland taken between January and March this year .\n\n\n \n\nThe two pieces of legislation forbid the use of seven prohibited\nchemicals , including chloramphenicol , and restrict the use of 10 chemicals .\n\n\n \n\nA department spokeswoman said a health certificate was needed for\nevery food item imported into the territory and samples were taken at the\nborder and during the resale and wholesale processes . \n\n \n\nLo Wing-lok , an infectious disease expert and legislator\nrepresenting the medical sector , said: \" Some of the mainland farms\nmay not have a strict monitoring system .\n\n\nThat  ' s why taking samples from different farms would make a\ndifference . &rdquo; \n\n \n\nDr Lo said Hong Kong requires stringent testing of imported food\nproducts , but he urged the Government to widen the scope of sample testing\nand strengthen co-operation with its mainland counterparts . \n\n \n\n klaudia@scmp.com", "subdomain": "HONG_KONG_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f2005e06-6caa-4cd1-a1b6-d03f2ce2d7c9", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:53.099628+00:00"}
