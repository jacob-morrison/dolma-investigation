though we felt that our voices will be recorded\n\n<$A> \n\nWe need Su Lian\n\n\nSu Lian will probably say something like 'Oh yes yes lah\n\n\nWhat do you want me to say\n\n\nAnd then she'll go on\n\n<$C> \n\nBut these days you never know\n\n\nUh they could be recording your voices anywhere\n\n<$A> \n\nOver the telephone ah\n\n<$C> \n\nYah even now while we are counting money\n\n<$A> \n\nAh <unclear> word </unclear> Is it illegal\n\n<$C> \n\nSs not illegal lah\n\n<$A> \n\nI know the police and all that do that lah\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nBut isn't that illegal\n\n\nIt's illegal overseas\n\n<$C> \n\nThere's no right of privacy here\n\n<$A> \n\nHa Singapore ah\n\n<$C> \n\nYah\n\n<$A> \n\nReally ah\n\n\nWhat do you mean no right of privacy at all\n\n<$D> \n\nYou mean in the States they couldn't do that\n\n<$A> \n\nNo they they\n\n<$C> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nApparently they can tape your phone conversation and use it\nas a what evidence in court ah\n\n<$C> \n\nThe only thing they can't do is give your IC number your your\naddress\n\n\nIf you write to <unclear> word </unclear> because there's a some\nuh section in the National Registration Act which says that whatever\ninformation inside there\n\n<$D> \n\nBut they wouldn't know it's\n\n<$C> \n\nis private and confidential except to the authorities\n\n<$D> \n\nBut then they have to prove that it's it was you on the phone\nnah\n\n<$A> \n\nEasy what\n\n<$C> \n\nYah\n\n<$D> \n\nHow\n\n<$A> \n\nProbably get you to talk on the phone again and do a voice\nread\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay could you snore\n\n\nI want you to read this sentence\n\n\nI want you to read these these same words\n\n<$D> \n\nBut how proof how fool-proof is\n\n\nuh how fool-proof is a voice\n\n<$C> \n\nYes not fool-proof\n\n\nYou know you can never proof by uh signature yah\n\n\nThe\n\n<$A> \n\nSo forgery all that lah\n\n<$C> \n\nIn Singapore at least none of the I mean tech officers will\ngo down and confirm that that is the writing of someone\n\n<$D> \n\nBut this kind of things they will only do if it's something\nreal serious like\n\n<$C> \n\nYah\n\n<$D> \n\nyou you confess that you murdered someone or you posted to\nyour friends\n\n<$C> \n\nYah\n\n\nNo they'll probably send it to England and give someone to\npositively confirm\n\n<$A> \n\nAs a <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$C> \n\nYah\n\n<$A> \n\nas evidence\n\n<$C> \n\nYah\n\n<$D> \n\nSo what is actually the amount of tapes they use\n\n<$C> \n\nYah\n\n<$A> \n\nSo if you don't have right of privacy right you mean down\nhere you don't need a warrant to walk into your house\n\n<$C> \n\nThey need\n\n<$A> \n\nSo there's still privacy there what\n\n<$C> \n\nI know but privacy in the sense of recording your\nconversations\n\n<$D> \n\nSo there's no sanctuary not like in the Old Testament times\nwhere you can run to a village and then nobody can\n\n<$A> \n\nOr run run to a church ah\n\n<$D> \n\nThen how\n\n\nOr run to your room\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy\n\n<$D> \n\nThe sanctuary\n\n\nWould would they arrest someone in the sanctuary\n\n<$C> \n\nI don't think they want\n\n\nThey'll probably wait until\n\n<$D> \n\nSo so you go you go there and you just sit there and sit\ntight you know\n\n<$A> \n\n'A' in countries uh you are\n\n<$C> \n\nBut then you charge uh an embassy they wouldn't go into an\nembassy what\n\n<$A> \n\nYah because neutral ground\n\n<$C> \n\nBecause neutral yah it's considered part of the territory of\nthe other country\n\n<$D> \n\nthe other country\n\n<$A> \n\nSo so so would the church be neutral ground\n\n<$C> \n\nNo\n\n<$D> \n\nThe land still owns the government still owns the land\n\n<$C> \n\nYah yah\n\n<$D> \n\nEmbassy\n\n<$C> \n\nEmbassy no\n\n\nIt's part of the\n\n<$A> \n\nBut overseas it is isn't it\n\n<$C> \n\nYeh\n\n\nThat's why you have certain cases like that <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n<$D> \n\nSo let's say you rob a bank uh you carry a bundle of money\nlike that you you know you run and police chasing you and you jump into the\n\n<$C> \n\nYah\n\n<$A> \n\nembassy F&\n\n<$C> \n\nThe embassy\n\n<$A> \n\nThe embassy'll probably find out that you are a robber and\nthrow you out lah\n\n<$C> \n\nYah\n\n\nNo they I mean if even in that sort of a situation if the police\nrun in\n\n<$D> \n\nThey\n\n<$C> \n\nI think they wouldn't\n\n<$D> \n\nThey won't lah\n\n<$C> \n\nraise a fuss about it lah\n\n\nSo by because at the end of the day you must see what are they\ngoing to do\n\n\nAre they going to declare war\n\n\nOr cut off diplomatic relations\n\n<$D> \n\nOver you uh over a bank over a bank robber only\n\n<$C> \n\nYah\n\n<$A> \n\nWe may we may do some diplomatic relations with Russia ah\n\n<$C> \n\nYah\n\n<$A> \n\nSu Lian is there\n\n<$D> \n\nOoh I took it just so that I can donate to to the poor people\nin Russia\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd Russian will probably say something like\n\n<$D> \n\nBuy food buy food for the poor children\n\n<$A> \n\nThe lawyer probably say something like I don't know you know\nyou don't know I don't know uh\n\n\nIt probably saves in efforts\n\n<$C> \n\nYeh\n\n\nWell this is the last session

I'll\nbe testing some other classes so the time-table will be different then\n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n<$C> \n\nSo Thursday is good\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay okay then\n\n\nThen we'll I will set it at Thursday tentatively\n\n<$C> \n\nDo you do you teach the second and third years too\n\n<$A> \n\nWell I I teach the second years\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nUh ELN2 OWC\n\n<$C> \n\nOh okay\n\n<$A> \n\nYap\n\n<$C> \n\nSo which means that in another one or two they are they are\ndoing interviews too\n\n<$A> \n\nNo they're doing uh role-plays\n\n<$C> \n\nNo they're not\n\n\nAh okay because I in two or three weeks' time they'll be they'd\nhave finished\n\n<$A> \n\nThey would have finished\n\n<$C> \n\nHow many hours <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat\n\n\nThe\n\n<$C> \n\nThe <unclear> word </unclear> the ELN2\n\n<$A> \n\nTwo hours a week\n\n<$C> \n\nTwo hours but just just one class\n\n<$A> \n\nNo I've got\n\n\nlet me see\n\n\nUh I've got three classes\n\n<$C> \n\nThree classes <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n\nSo how do you find your students\n\n<$C> \n\nWhich group\n\n<$A> \n\nYour your second and third years\n\n<$C> \n\nThe ah\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$C> \n\nThe both are BM\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nUh I like the second years very much\n\n\nProbably because everything is organised and I I know the syllabus\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nUh pretty well and so\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$C> \n\nand and I think plus the fact or major factor is that they're\nvery\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$C> \n\nUh co-operative\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd diligent and they're fun at the same time such that when\nwhen we have light light things they they all uhm take part and they're very\nresponsive\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nand when their actual work comes uh hard work\n\n\nThey they get down to work too\n\n<$A> \n\nThey get down to work\n\n<$C> \n\nYa so I enjoy that group very much\n\n\nThe third years\n\n\nUh for some reason or other I don't seem to enjoy the class very\nmuch uh\n\n<$A> \n\nWhich course is that\n\n<$C> \n\nBoth are BM\n\n<$A> \n\nOh don't I know\n\n\nI understand because the the third year syllabus tend to be uhm a\nlittle bit more uh more fragmented I think because more fragmented than than\nthe second years\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm uhm Uhm\n\n\nThan the second years uh\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n\nActually I quite enjoy teaching grammar\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm uhm uhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nand that's why I enjoy teaching the first years <unclear>\nword </unclear> even thouh everybody find it such a drag you know\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know\n\n<$C> \n\nYa ya\n\n<$A> \n\nBut uhm actually I think it's it's quite a good course in\nthat you you you get them to you know probably for the last time in their\nlives\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nThey will have somebody to\n\n<$C> \n\nThey will have something to guide them\n\n<$A> \n\nTo guide them and tell them you know\n\n<$C> \n\nSuch a uh uh <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nStringent\n\n\nYa amendment\n\n<$C> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause after that it's really free for all kind of thing so\n\n<$C> \n\nYa true and I think they need the basics\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$C> \n\nThey all do\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$C> \n\nEven though some of them speak well they they still get down\nto all the\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$C> \n\nNitty gritty problems\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nin language\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd I also like the first years for the fact that when they\ncome they're all new to the whole environment\n\n<$A> \n\nYes yes\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd they stick to each other quite well\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd so and so the class is cohesive\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd I like to teach a cohesive class\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$C> \n\nBecause they all one for all and all for one\n\n<$A> \n\nFor one\n\n<$C> \n\nKind of feeling and and it's fun this way\n\n<$A> \n\nYes right\n\n\nI I I have that feeling also\n\n<$C> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd also third third years tend to be more responsive\n\n\nNo first years tend to be more responsive\n\n<$C> \n\nResponsive ya\n\n<$A> \n\nWhereas the second years they're all jaded and cynical\nsomewhat\n\n<$C> \n\nYes yes yes ya\n\n\nAnd they know the tricks of the trade like how many times to be\nabsent\n\n<$A> \n\nAbsent\n\n<$C> \n\nand how to irritate you but otherwise ya\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd I always find first years more uh more appreciative\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm ya whereas the second years tend to be a little more\n\n<$C> \n\nThey they\n\n<$A> \n\nMore indifferent\n\n<$C> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nTowards the teacher\n\n<$C> \n\nThey rely a little bit more on you maybe that's why it makes\nme feel good too because this' their first year and they don't know about\nthings like uh uh rules or regulations\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd and and what how to go about this and that\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd it it feels good that they depend on you or on the class\nas a whole\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd that's why they do come to class with more\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$C> \n\nExpectations and\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$C> \n\nLook uh with more anticipation\n\n<$A> \n\nYa uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nThat's why\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd also second years when they move up to the second year\nthey do change groups\n\n\nThey do change the grouping is it\n\n<$A> \n\nYes and then they don't they they have to make friends all\nover\n\n<$C> \n\nYa ya and then so usually if one of two friends go up with\nthem they just clique with these two\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm Uhm\n\n\nYes\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd then two or three others from another group stay\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> yes\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd then I I don't like it this way when they don't mix well\nand co-operate\n\n<$A> \n\nYes yes and then when it comes to final year they are they\nbecome quite individualistic\n\n<$C> \n\nOh ya ya because all they want to do is to get out of the\nplace\n\n<$A> \n\nget out of the place finish the project and then you know\n\n<$C> \n\nYa ya\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd also then again\n\n<$C> \n\nMore street-wise too\n\n<$A> \n\nMore street-wise\n\n<$C> \n\nCampus-wise\n\n<$A> \n\nYa then I hear\n\n\nI I I always get to uhm to you know listen to all these complaints\nabout ya what group <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$C> \n\nAh yes yes\n\n<$A> \n\nPeople who can't work with each other\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd uh yes and quite a few times I have to mediate you know\n\n<$C> \n\nOh between that uh between them in their quarrels\n\n<$A> \n\nYa and help uhm ya\n\n<$C> \n\nThe second years\n\n<$A> \n\nThe the third years mainly\n\n<$C> \n\nThe third years\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause I used to teach the third years BMs\n\n<$C> \n\nUsually projects ya\n\n<$A> \n\nSo every time they have a project you get one or two who are\nnot very co-operative\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nMakes life difficult for the others\n\n<$C> \n\nOh ya\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd and this year we are told to assess them uh or rather one\ncomponent is peer assessment\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd I hated it when I have to call up one person and say and\nlike oh you tell me about that group\n\n<$A> \n\nHey like gossiping\n\n<$C> \n\nI feel so\n\n\nI'm ya\n\n\nI feel as though I'm encouraging them to tell uh tell tale about\neach other\n\n<$A> \n\nTale\n\n<$C> \n\nBut I guess\n\n<$A> \n\nbut how do they respond\n\n\nDo they tell on each other actually\n\n<$C> \n\nIt's I have to I have to\n\n<$A> \n\nDo they take that opportunity to\n\n<$C> \n\nYa I've always to to to set the whole perspective right you\nsee\n\n\nYou know you you mustn't think that is a friend\n\n\nJust tell me objectively whether whether you like or dislike the\nperson\n\n\nJust tell me whether the person does contribute fairly or not\n\n\nYou know I keep having to set this scenario before they tell me\nthings\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd so what happens\n\n\nDo do they actually gossip\n\n<$C> \n\nIt's okay\n\n\nThey no\n\n\nI think they they straighten up and they realise it's their\nresponsibility uh to to to tell the right thing \n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nso they do tell me if some are not working hard\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$C> \n\nand also I match that with my own observation\n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n<$C> \n\nYa when when they discuss and I in fact sometimes I'm more\nprejudiced I I feel that certain people are not contributing but when this\nperson come and say: oh ya he or she does\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$C> \n\nso I have to change my own uh uh assessment too\n\n<$A> \n\nuhm uhm uhm", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "2987a10c-5fb0-45f7-91fd-3912e538f915", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nSo uhm now I've three draughtsmen right\n\n\nI have Siew Kiau Emily uh Siew Kiau Emily\n\n<$B> \n\nDiana\n\n<$A> \n\nAh Diana and then Thomas for the editing\n\n\nSo what I ask them to do is Simon had already given me the list of\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nUh what what they have submitted you know to the authorities and\nwhat they have produced so far lah\n\n\nSo next week we can arrange <unclear> word </unclear> to discuss\nabout that\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\n'Think the problem now is really to see how far they have managed to\ngo with the different drawings that they have to do\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm I now uh\n\n\nDiana is doing all the <unclear> word </unclear> submission\ndrawings\n\n\nShe's already finishing up you know uh amending the drawings to fit\n<unclear> word </unclear> requirements uh\n\n\nSo she's doing it manual not on computer and uh Diana is now doing\nfor me all the drawings for the the contractor the diaphragm more openings\n\n\nSo she's clearing up that lot and then Emily is doing elevation\ndrawings with the pre-cast panels four by four work out all the dimensions\nhow far\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nFrom the coluhmn grid and so on and also I uh the sewage now\nthe sewage reply has come back she has to do updating\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nin the computer\n\n<$B> \n\nSo how do you think Tom can help to sort of vet the drawings\nor uh sort of help you in the detailing of some of these things\n\n\nBecause I think at the moment he does seem to feel a bit difficult\nuh problems in in co-ordinating some of these drawings\n\n<$A> \n\nIs it\n\n\nHe didn't fill a form\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause I I I think the problem also partly because of this\ncomputer drawing thing you know\n\n<$A> \n\nAh\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause we had we can't get a feel of what are the the\ndrawings in the computer\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat I've asked him to do so far is like for instance the\nsewage unit uh once the reply came back\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nuh I I made some comments on the reply by by sewage right\n\n\nThen I ask uh him to look through and discuss with Emily\n\n\nSo he looked through Emily's set of drawings and discussed how the\nrequirements uh can be met nuh\n\n\nSo uh he also went down with Emily to see the offices in\nEnvironment\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nto discuss about their requirement whether we can do it or not\nor is it cost costing a problem and so on\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nSo that is the technical part I think he can help me do you\nknow\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nall these nitty gritty detail things\n\n\nSo uhm it's the same for like the contractor drawings uh\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause he's got more technical knowledge for the actual\nconstruction\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nSo if that's true he ask Diana to help draw up all these\nthings uh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo has he managed to get onto that yet\n\n<$A> \n\nYa he's doing that now but what what I find problem is he's he\nhas not enough time also you know\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nSo when whenever I ask him he may not do it promptly\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nhe said do it later\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nSo like the diaphragm mode we are a bit behind time giving\ninformation\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm ya\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nI think that's why we are sort of discussing to see what of\nany of the other work he can uh sort of delegate to other people so that he\ncan have more time for your project\n\n<$A> \n\nWhen you say continue working drawing you mean uhm they\nconsult him on the detailing or he just checks the drawing\n\n<$B> \n\nI think that he has to I think it would be better if he could\nreally co-ordinate all the drawings so that uh because certain problems which\noccur on other projects he can sort of make sure that it doesn't recur in\nthis one Things like that and the amount of detailing you know\n\n\nBecause I think for us uhm you I think you'll you need to do a lot\nmore design work right\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSo a lot of these details in a way is probably like wasting\nyour time if you have to go and give all the details to the draughtsmen\n\n\nSo this type of things if he can help to\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\ngive instructions to to them\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm like even like uh now I get the set of drawings from\nstructure <unclear> word </unclear> from contractor drawing <unclear> word\n</unclear> there's slight difference\n\n\nThere's a lot of checking to be done\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm yes yes\n\n<$A> \n\nuh to check against our architectural drawings for\ndiscrepancies\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nSo uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nYes some of those if he can\n\n<$A> \n\nwhether he will be the one actually doing it or he should have\nhe will as eh de designate and allocate duties to the rest\n\n<$B> \n\nI think those type of details if the draughtsman who is doing\nthe actual drawing of say the rises\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThey probably uh know the details of the rises sort of better\n\n\nSo maybe the the TO themselves can can check some of those type of\ndetails\n\n\nBut those things which are like okay staircase details and those\nfloor plans sections and all that\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nI think Tom can help to just check that what they've drawn\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nis sort of practical or you know\n\n\nAny uhm detailing things that they've to look out for\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd uhm I don't know perhaps we should also look into what we\ncan use standard drawings\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSee what other things whether there are any standard drawings\nthat you can sort of incorporate\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nRather than having to\n\n<$A> \n\nActually now they're not really getting into details yet you\nknow\n\n\nIt's it's still overall plan and getting levels correct\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nFloor like staircase trap riser and landing levels floor\n<unclear> word </unclear> levels\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then the riser opening shifting the beams and all these\nthings\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay Uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I think we have to already start on the details right\n\n\nBecause or else uhm August is very close\n\n<$A> \n\nI know like I I\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\ntry to list like\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nThere's one thousand and one drawings to do you know\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's right\n\n<$A> \n\nHow to finish you know\n\n<$B> \n\nYa that's right ya\n\n\nI don't know\n\n\nHopefully with the new drauhtsmen coming in for CMB I don't know\nwhether we can use any uh to produce whether there they can help us or not\n\n<$A> \n\nCan we use their resources\n\n<$B> \n\nI think if if they are not uh I don't know whether they need\n<unclear> word </unclear> straightaway now or not\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nwhether we can help whether they can help to do something for\nus first\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause our timing is a bit ahead of theirs right\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSo it'll be something we have to discuss with the LAM side uh\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nYou want to talk anything more interesting\n\n<$A> \n\nYa the D and D\n\n\nUh Janet is going to be my stage manager\n\n\nSo\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nHave you got the tape uh\n\n<$B> \n\nI can't I can't recall having it you know\n\n\nI've asked you to check with Nina\n\n<$A> \n\nHuh\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause uh she was handling the thing\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause Jin Jin said uh she returned the tape to you\n\n\nJin Jin was the one who did the taping of the Friday Background\nand said uh news opening piece\n\n<$B> \n\nUh I've to go through\n\n<$A> \n\nSo last night I tried\n\n\nI taped the news and then I did a narration of the opening scene\n\n\nUh then after that I was supposed to tape Friday Background\n\n\nYou know then my sister her stupid watch was slow by five minutes\n\n\nSo I I was talking\n\n<$B> \n\nSo you were with her and a friend\n\n<$A> \n\nso by the time I went and <unclear> word </unclear> the TV\nthe uh hey uh opening scene music was gone\n\n\nSo I tape the ending of Friday Background the music\n\n\nI'm not sure if it's the same as the opening music\n\n<$B> \n\nHa\n\n\nI can't recall\n\n\nI'll go through whatever tape I can find\n\n<$A> \n\nUh\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I can't recall if I had it what I would have done with it\nyou see\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nBut uh I think in fact they had it on different tapes is it\n\n\nBecause I taped the voice myself\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nThat was\n\n<$A> \n\nOh you did the newsreading\n\n<$B> \n\nI did the newsreading\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I think I did I tape onto that\n\n\nI can't remember\n\n\nMaybe I did\n\n\nUh I can't remember\n\n\nI'll I'll\n\n<$A> \n\nYou see if you can find lah\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nIf not I'll just use whatever I've taped you know\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's just that the Friday Background only comes like I think\nevery two weeks right\n\n<$B> \n\nOne <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nIs it two weeks\n\n<$A> \n\nI think it's every two week you know\n\n<$B> \n\nI thought there's only one\n\n<$A> \n\nThen there's Contact-Y then there's Feed\n\n\nOh yes every two weeks there's Feedback fortnightly\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nFeedback and then Friday Background\n\n\nFeedback Friday\n\n\nIt'll be too late next week\n\n\nIt's it's Saturday is D and D\n\n<$B> \n\nYa ya ya ya\n\n<$A> \n\nSo he's she's doing stage management\n\n\nNow he's going to collect all the props for me lah\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nThe only problem we have is like <unclear> word </unclear> I\nforgot to call Mandarin\n\n\nUh to ask them whether they have a whiteboard and a flip chart\n\n\nWe want to mount the you know the carpark sign on the\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nflip chart you know\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then use their whiteboard to pin up the world map\n\n<$B> \n\nI thought flip chart flip chart we can still bring but\nwhiteboard will be rather big quite difficult\n\n\nI think they should have uh because\n\n<$A> \n\nWe don't have a flip chart\n\n\nThey what they use last time was a a smaller whiteboard y' know\nwhich is still quite high\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\non castors\n\n\nI don't think we can put that into her car\n\n<$B> \n\nI think Mandarin should have lah because they organise\nseminars\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> seminars\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I think they should have flip chart\n\n<$B> \n\nSo they should have\n\n<$A> \n\nSo these are the only two things uh that Mandarin has to\nprovide lah\n\n\nThe rest we can bring right\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nProp uh costuhmes and uh what else huh\n\n\nThe guns and all that\n\n<$B> \n\nHave they given you the stage layout\n\n<$A> \n\nNo I think I shall ask from them\n\n<$B> \n\nYa because in case they have the big uhm sound mixers and all\nthat\n\n\nThe deejays equipment\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nMay be blocking\n\n<$A> \n\nDon't know if they show that on the layout\n\n<$B> \n\nThen they will have to check with the <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nHuh\n\n\nThursday we have rehearsal\n\n\nThey slotted us on Thursday\n\n<$B> \n\nOn stage is it\n\n<$A> \n\nYa at Mandarin\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay because the last time when we had the other show\nremember we had to discuss with Victor Khoo where he was going to put all his\ndeejay desk and all that\n\n<$A> \n\nYa see this woman that woman uh\n\n\nCan't stand her\n\n\nShe just wrote a letter to Mandarin you know\n\n<$B> \n\nWho is this woman\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then Tsk\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay KR\n\n<$A> \n\nYa lah\n\n\nYa now this woman who is the secretary lah of the committee\n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nSo she just wrote a letter and cc to Menon the Chairman right\n\n\nAnd then give it <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nThen Menon gave it to me\n\n\nShe just <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nIn the letter your rehearsal time is what time to what time and\nthen another organization what time to what time and tell the banquet manager\nto prepare uh\n\n\nWe need how many standing mikes and all that\n\n\nVery simple lah\n\n\nHer requirements is standing mikes stage of what size and so on\n\n\nSo I've called her up\n\n\nI said uh are you sure they will be able to give us the exact\nlayout on Thursday\n\n\nD and D is on Saturday\n\n\nThey might have other functions on Friday right\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nSo the last time our last year D and D they couldn't give us\nthe exact\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nArrangements\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nSo there's no point going down if there is no they can't give\nprovide you the exact arrangement\n\n\nSo I called her on the phone she said Oh I assuhme he has to do it\n\n\nI already wrote to him you know \n\n\nUh I already told him what's our requirement and he should\nprepare that on Thursday\n\n\nShe also cc to the deejay of that night\n\n<$B> \n\nIs it Victor Khoo uh\n\n<$A> \n\nNo it's Leslie Pillay\n\n<$B> \n\nLeslie Pillay\n\n<$A> \n\nOne of those guys on either radio or TV lah\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm Uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nSo uh I said then can I call uh the sales banquet manager\nmyself\n\n\nShe said Yeh you go and call yourself\n\n\nSo I had to call the banquet manager and ask him are you going to\nprovide all those things that she lists down in her letter\n\n\nI mean she can't even be bothered to contact him and find out if\neverything will be okay\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm uhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's all on the letter only\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n\nIn fact last time we even went down to to discuss with the deejay\nand everything what the exact location\n\n<$A> \n\nYa ya\n\n\nSo she cc to the deejay\n\n\nI hope the deejay turns up on Thursday\n\n<$B> \n\nI doubt it you know\n\n<$A> \n\nI mean she's not even\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nBothered to find out if those people will turn up\n\n<$B> \n\nbecause uhm what else\n\n\nBecause if they have say a big prize table on stage\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nThe deejay's thing on stage the rostruhm and all that then\n\n<$A> \n\nThen I ask her you know do we have a day-room that we can\nstore our props\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nThen she say no just at the the usual lah say where do you\nkeep your lucky draw prizes\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nShe said oh we just keep it backstage\n\n\nYa so\n\n<$B> \n\nI thought normally the hotel will give a room\n\n<$A> \n\nYa so I ask the banquet sales manager by on the phone

{"text": "<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> I want you to tell me how much to\nchange\n\n\nOkay but have you decided roughly what <unclear> word </unclear>\namount\n\n\nI don't know how much you want\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat is the estimate\n\n\nHave you all decided or not\n\n<$A> \n\nHave not decided\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause eight hundred you all were saying for the food and the\nno for accommodation and entrance fees right\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nBut then\n\n<$C> \n\nYou got the breakdown or not\n\n<$B> \n\nMaybe you can ask uh Beng what is the best best op\n\n<$A> \n\nDo you know how much currency we need to bring\n\n<$B> \n\nHow much are you estimating for food let's say per meal\n\n<$D> \n\nI don't know\n\n\nJust bringing two thousand dollars\n\n<$B> \n\nOh two thousand uh \n\n<$D> \n\nYa Then from there <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\nBut how much are you going to change for each country\n\n\nFive hundred\n\n<$D> \n\nWhen I go there then I know what\n\n<$B> \n\nOh you're just bringing all cheques is it\n\n<$D> \n\nYa <unclear> word </unclear> owes me two hundred and forty six\ndollars\n\n<$B> \n\nBut it's not in currency\n\n<$C> \n\nYa\n\n<$D> \n\nHa\n\n<$B> \n\nSo Beng how how much do you think we should estimate per meals\n\n<$C> \n\nForty twenty forty for accommodation twenty\n\n<$B> \n\nPer day\n\n\nBut our accommodation is all fostered in right now\n\n\nIn your latest\n\n<$D> \n\nYa but I don't see I don't think you should count it that way\n\n\nWhat I gave you was an estimate\n\n\nI mean are you going to take take all the money out and then\nseparate out this is uh what moving money and that is <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nThat means right\n\n\nSo your two thousand includes what you have costed in your\nitinerary plus food and souvenirs\n\n<$D> \n\nYa ya the whole thing\n\n<$B> \n\nSo that is about what we have calculated\n\n<$ > \n Two thousand\n\n<$B> \n\nTwo thousand\n\n\nSo which means it's correct\n\n\nYou see it's about five hundred to <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nFIve hundred per country is it\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nSo if you go by her estimate in the write-up then that one each\ncountry is about two hundred fifty\n\n\nSo we left about two hundred fifty for our own food and souvenirs\n\n\nThen if want to bring some more cheques hor\n\n<$C> \n\nWe only have four countries so <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nTwo thousand uh\n\n<$C> \n\nYa it's enough\n\n<$B> \n\nSo that's why we were intending to ask him to\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> can you pass me your cash cheque\n\n<$B> \n\nCheque\n\n<$C> \n\nCheques\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd your name\n\n<$A> \n\nIn my name uh\n\n\nOh okay lor\n\n\nOkay okay in my name in my name\n\n\nThen I write a cash cheque for them\n\n<$C> \n\nOh to the\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause uh the money people prefers cash cheques\n\n<$C> \n\nOh I see\n\n\nAre you going to bring traveller's cheques\n\n<$A> \n\nYa traveller's cheques\n\n<$C> \n\nBut are you going to bring cash as well\n\n<$A> \n\nYa as well\n\n<$C> \n\nMag leh\n\n<$A> \n\nYou\n\n<$C> \n\nI'm intending to bring all cash you know\n\n\nBut make it a bit of traveller's cheques\n\n<$A> \n\nAll cash huh\n\n\nYou know what I'm afraid of losing it you know\n\n\nYou don't know whether I'll lose it or not\n\n<$C> \n\nTwo hundred and fifty\n\n<$A> \n\nJust in case\n\n<$B> \n\nAnyway we are we are sharing you know\n\n\nSo each one of us will be only be carrying two thousand dollars\n\n<$C> \n\nTwo thousand\n\n<$B> \n\nFor two currencies\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat you mean you are sharing\n\n<$B> \n\nShe's going to hold two countries' currency\n\n\nI'm going to hold two currencies\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nThen if you need\n\n<$A> \n\nIs that better\n\n<$B> \n\nHuh\n\n\nI think just handling less currency that is all lah but\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nThe amount of the amount spent is the same\n\n<$A> \n\nSo you're just going to contribute into the pool lah or\nsomething like that\n\n<$B> \n\nActually we're not even contributing\n\n\nI'll just buy for\n\n<$A> \n\nYa lah ya lah\n\n<$B> \n\nyou know how much for the currency\n\n\nCome back then <unclear> word </unclear> whatever\n\n<$A> \n\nThat's the receipt for Vicky\n\n<$C> \n\nFor the Europass\n\n\nSo the Europass is four 0 nine right\n\n<$A> \n\nYa <unclear> word </unclear> another four one\n\n<$B> \n\nYa I'm going to write the cheque\n\n<$C> \n\nSo how\n\n<$A> \n\nSo can write me a cheque\n\n\nWill it be\n\n\nYou have already\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay I have the cheque here no but the amount is not\nspecified\n\n<$C> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> calculator\n\n<$B> \n\nAnybody got calculator\n\n<$A> \n\nI think I have I have a calculator\n\n<$C> \n\nDo you know the exchange rates\n\n<$A> \n\nNo I don't know the exchange rates\n\n<$C> \n\nExactly speaking\n\n<$B> \n\nRoughly\n\n<$C> \n\nThen based on this one right\n\n\nStudent\n\n<$B> \n\nYa roughly\n\n<$A> \n\nBut usually <unclear> word </unclear> Sing dollar two\nthousand and then I'll change it for you five hundred per currency\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nor what\n\n<$B> \n\nBut that means you will have very loose change right\n\n\nYou may come up to the last cent and all that\n\n<$C> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nUh\n\n<$B> \n\nI thought maybe we could do it the other way like five\nhundred guilders or five thousand guilders then how much Sing dollars per\nguilder <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nBut that means four hundred and something Sing dollars\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nAh\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nIsn't it easier\n\n<$A> \n\nBut the exchange you might not know the exchange rates or you\ncan roughly <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nJust a rough rough estimate\n\n<$C> \n\nOr is it easier to say I want uh five hundred worth of five\nhundred Sing dollars worth of guilders\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$C> \n\nThen they just give you the amount\n\n<$B> \n\nRight\n\n\nSo you have come up with a few cents all the loose <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n<$C> \n\nIs it easier this way or you're going to change\n\n<$A> \n\nBut loose change is alright what\n\n<$B> \n\nThey might not have loose change\n\n\nIn fact then they might want <unclear> word </unclear> Sing\ndollars from you\n\n<$C> \n\nThen they might ask you to buy less Sing dollar uh\n\n<$B> \n\nYa lor\n\n<$A> \n\nDoesn't matter lor\n\n<$C> \n\nYa lah but roughly you would say okay about five hundred for\nthis currency\n\n<$A> \n\nBut maximum two thousand right\n\n<$C> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause if we if we calculate now we can roughly gauge like\nthe closest to five hundred\n\n<$C> \n\nLike okay Amsterdam is what ah\n\n<$B> \n\nThis is already three zero one\n\n<$C> \n\nThis is one currency right\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$C> \n\nOkay\n\n\nThis is about two seventy you know three about two seven something\n\n\nUh 'A' but this per person right\n\n<$B> \n\nPer person\n\n\nOkay\n\n<$C> \n\nSo if two persons you need three\n\n<$B> \n\n'A' how does it work\n\n<$A> \n\nThere the numbers are here\n\n<$B> \n\nOh okay\n\n\nThree zero zero\n\n\nWhere is zero\n\n<$A> \n\nHere here\n\n<$C> \n\nWhere's on and off\n\n<$B> \n\nThree zero zero times aiyuh so confusing looking at the\nalphabets\n\n<$A> \n\nWrong already\n\n<$C> \n\nWrong already\n\n<$B> \n\nThree zero\n\n<$A> \n\nHey I'm going to bring this along you know\n\n<$C> \n\nYa I think this is useful\n\n<$B> \n\nThree zero one\n\n<$A> \n\nAre you sure\n\n\nYou can use point five\n\n<$B> \n\nPoint aiyah multiply okay about six zero <unclear> word\n</unclear> for food right\n\n<$A> \n\nPoint two\n\n\nWhy multiply by two\n\n\nOh I see I see\n\n<$B> \n\nTwo person\n\n\nTwo person will be six hundred and three\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nTime three\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm then times point nine\n\n\nOh no for food only\n\n<$C> \n\nYa this is only for food\n\n<$B> \n\nAiyah don't need don't need\n\n\nI'll just do it in Singapore's Singapore currency uh\n\n<$A> \n\nYa then\n\n<$B> \n\nYa okay two seven two seven one\n\n<$C> \n\nTwo seven one point three nine\n\n<$A> \n\nThree nine\n\n<$C> \n\nOne <unclear> word </unclear> is\n\n<$B> \n\nTwo\n\n<$A> \n\nFive <unclear> word </unclear> : T\n\n<$A> \n\nThen my\n\n<$B> \n\nYa terrible it's too close it's too close\n\n<$A> \n\nAiyah come uh come uh\n\n\nTwo seven one point three five times two\n\n<$B> \n\ntimes two\n\n<$A> \n\nThis and then so\n\n<$B> \n\nBring up to a thousand dollars uh the closest times times two\nagain\n\n<$C> \n\nWhy times two again\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay can you uhm oh\n\n<$A> \n\nMinus one thousand\n\n<$B> \n\nThis okay this amount would be just\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy don't you just calculate one thousand\n\n\nThen you times <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$C>

\n\nOkay he was my boy-friend then\n\n<$B> \n\nYa uh huh\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd what happened was it was so funny\n\n\nI wanted to impress him and at that time I was in the States you\nsee\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nSo oh\n\n\nOkay I bought cooking\n\n\nI bought this book entitled uhm Chinese cooking A to Z or\nstep-by-step or something you know really simple\n\n\nIt was so funny I followed it practically step by step but took so\nlong to read each step and the similar instructions you know\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nBefore I went on to the next one that things just went crazy\nlike the first step was to heat up oil in the wok\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nand let the oil heat up before you throw in the garlic you\nsee\n\n\nBut I took so long reading the next few steps that the oil kept\nheating until when I threw in the garlic the garlic simply went black\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nya everything was terrible and I didn't know that you had to\nseparate broccoli into flowerets you know\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nYou have to slice off the stem\n\n<$B> \n\nDid you put the whole thing in\n\n<$A> \n\nI just I mean broke off great big chunks you know and I\ndidn't know you had to\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nchop off the stalk <unclear> word </unclear> and there was\nthis great big green things you know uhm trying to cook\n\n\nAnd I didn't know that it mattered which part of beef you bought\nyou see\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nwhich cut of beef for es especially for stir-frying\n\n<$B> \n\nya\n\n<$A> \n\nyou should try to buy steak\n\n<$B> \n\nUh huh\n\n<$A> \n\nyou shouldn't just buy cube beef or you know stewing beef\n\n<$B> \n\nYa ya I'm not very good at that either\n\n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nI've bought stewing beef which just because really tough the\nwhole time to stir-fry it\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nSo that was really a meal to remember\n\n\nYou know the broccoli was great big chunks the garlic was all\nblack\n\n<$B> \n\nSo was he impressed\n\n<$A> \n\nand the beef what\n\n\nHe kept saying not bad not bad but I noticed he didn't eat very\nmuch except for the rice\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nYa so but I've come a long way I think\n\n<$B> \n\nYa what do you cook now\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm my husband's favourite is mango beef\n\n<$B> \n\nOh interesting\n\n<$A> \n\nOh it's really delicious\n\n<$B>

western\neastern type of cookbooks right\n\n<$A> \n\nOh western eastern\n\n\nWell it was written by a Chinese lady\n\n<$B> \n\nwho's been at the west\n\n<$A> \n\nin the States for a long time\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nWell she claims it's a Cantonese dish\n\n\nAnyway it tastes really nice\n\n<$B> \n\nOh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's just like stir-frying beef like you would uhm stir-fry\noyster sauce beef or anything\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nbut uhm the seasoning is slightly different\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm you don't use so much oyster sauce you use a bit more uhm\nall sorts of things\n\n<$B> \n\nYep\n\n\nWine and all that\n\n<$A> \n\nDark dark soya sauce\n\n\nYa a bit of this a bit of that\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nsome spices\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nand you actually cook the mango too\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nand it comes out really delicious\n\n<$B> \n\nOh must get the recipe from you\n\n<$A> \n\nOh ya ya I'll photocopy it\n\n\nYou you're not Cantonese are

dishes\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nnot because you know it's western but because\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's easy\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's very easy\n\n\nSo what I\n\n<$A> \n\nOh casseroles and\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's right\n\n<$A> \n\nOh <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nI'll just dump everything into the pot and then put it in the\noven and it's ready\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's very convenient\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A>

you think so\n\n<$B> \n\nSee how\n\n\nSurprised\n\n\nI thought it's just a poster\n\n\nSo you don't have to make poster lah for your case\n\n<$A> \n\nBut I have to make\n\n<$B> \n\nslides uh\n\n<$A> \n\nYa look\n\n<$B> \n\nthat means slide presentation sor\n\n<$A> \n\nI've to make slides\n\n<$B> \n\nBut\n\n<$A> \n\n'A'\n\n<$B> \n\nYou got some experience or not you got some experience or not\n\n<$A> \n\nMaking slides 'A'\n\n<$B> \n\nThat time you have already what\n\n\nThose slides that you have\n\n<$A> \n\nYa but they're totally different\n\n\nThis time you have to make slides for for gels stuff like that\n\n<$B> \n\nwith the results and so on\n\n\nI think there's a lot of work involved uh\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n\nBut can I make it less than eight minutes uh\n\n\nBut even now I say down here at eight minutes\n\n<$B> \n\nI think seven six minutes should be quite alright lah\n\n<$A> \n\nFive minutes\n\n<$B> \n\nFive minutes maybe too short you know\n\n\nFive minutes is only about sixty percent of the time only\n\n\nIf seven eight minutes I think should be alright\n\n\nUh\n\n\nNo I think you definitely got more things to talk about isn't it\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't want to talk too much because I've told you I've got\n<unclear> word </unclear> in August\n\n<$B> \n\nYou got slides and so on\n\n\nYou've got another one in August\n\n<$A> \n\nI've got another one in August\n\n\nSo I don't want I don't want to talk too much because <unclear>\nword </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nI thought that time you submitted a poster session\n\n\nSo you just put posters and then just stand around you know\n\n<$A> \n\nThe thing is I think they are the ones who decide\n\n<$B> \n\nOh they decide so\n\n<$A> \n\nThat is most\n\n<$B> \n\nYa lah\n\n\nGood lah\n\n\nMaybe they find that it's very interesting isn't\n\n<$A> \n\nPlease lah I am not\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's probably very new\n\n\nSo they are quite eager to find out more\n\n<$A> \n\nI think it's because of Alan Potter\n\n\nWhat do you think\n\n<$B> \n\nIs he in the committee\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat do you think\n\n\nUh it's IM it's organized by IMCB\n\n<$B> \n\nYa provided he's sitting in the committee uh\n\n<$A> \n\nNo he's not\n\n\nI don't think so then\n\n\nI don't think so\n\n\nI ask I'll ask this who uh Keng Chong uh\n\n\nFirst can we change ask him to change to posters\n\n\nSeriously\n\n<$B> \n\nChange it to poster uh\n\n<$A> \n\nYa what about that\n\n<$B> \n\nYa maybe you can try\n\n<$A> \n\nYou can try is it\n\n<$B> \n\nYou can try uh\n\n<$A> \n\nI all along I assume it's a poster you know\n\n<$B> \n\nYa I thought it's a poster too\n\n\nThat's what you said isn't it\n\n\nIt's outside that LT down there the canteen there\n\n<$A> \n\nYa ya ya ya\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then just put your poster there and then just stand\naround lah\n\n<$A> \n\nYa ya ya ya ya <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then ah ah\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n\nI'll ask Keng Chong about it uh\n\n\nHow's that\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nOh another thing\n\n<$B> \n\nHow about Keng Chong\n\n\nDid he receive this already\n\n<$A> \n\nHe receive\n\n\nI don't know I'm going to ask him then\n\n<$B> \n\nOh maybe his is a a poster or\n\n<$A> \n\nSo I can swop with him you mean\n\n<$B> \n\nYou can swop with him\n\n\nUh or if his is a talk then too bad lah you know\n\n\nI think it maybe quite difficult you know because they already\nallocated the time everything for you already\n\n\nSo it's quite difficult for you to withdraw like that\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy aiyah stupid me lah\n\n\nThen\n\n<$B> \n\nBut the good thing is a talk you just go there and then\nfinish up the whole thing\n\n\nEight minutes you see\n\n\nBecause poster I think you have to stand there for the whole day\nand so on right\n\n\nYou never know whether\n\n<$A> \n\nCome on a talk I would have known <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nI <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nI'll stutter all the way\n\n<$B> \n\nWell imagine Kenneth Mark down there can already what\n\n<$A> \n\nPlease he

can see uh from this person this person is a\n\n\nNever mind I'll ask Keng Chong about it anyway\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n\nGood lah interesting what\n\n\nGood experience\n\n<$A> \n\n'A' ask you something uh\n\n<$B> \n\nBut the thing is then you have to do duplicate uhm more work\nuh because if this is a slide you have to do slides\n\n<$A> \n\nHuh\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then over in US <unclear> word </unclear> would be a\nposter then you have to do another poster\n\n<$A> \n\nYa that's why\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause if this' poster then you just do one for both uh\n\n<$A> \n\nWho says so\n\n\nCannot you know\n\n<$B> \n\nIs it\n\n\nChange a bit lah change a bit\n\n<$A> \n\nEven change a bit also cannot\n\n\nThey say according to Ken you must have additional information\nwhere you approach someone for conference and papers\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm uhm uhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nHe makes it so difficult for me you know\n\n\nWherever we discuss something he he wants it to be perfect\n<unclear> word

room it's different\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy\n\n\nVery untidy uh\n\n<$A> \n\nI tell you everything is all over you know where he's to\nsearch then he's got to take out this and\n\n<$B> \n\nSo you're you're must settle down fast\n\n<$A> \n\nI'm not going to do his laundry or tidy up his room for him\n\n\nAnd anyway he says he's the kind who wants <unclear> word\n</unclear> not to be tidied so he he knows where is it in his untidy position\n\n<$B> \n\nNo different uh\n\n\nBefore he get married probably he said this\n\n\nAfter he get married he want everything to be spick and span lah\n\n<$A> \n\nAre you sure\n\n<$B> \n\nYa I think so uh\n\n<$A> \n\nThat's you okay\n\n\nThat's because Serene has been <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't care\n\n<$B>

uh\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay five minutes will do lah hor\n\n\nOkay right hor\n\n<$B> \n\nFive six\n\n\nFive minutes is a bit too short lah\n\n<$A> \n\nProbably can uh\n\n<$B> \n\nYou see you give an introduc\n\n\nYou see you give an introduction of uh TNA Beta\n\n\nGive an introduction of uh\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't need to\n\n\nWhy must you give introduction\n\n\nAll I do is present results

my brother and and this friend talking about something\nthey like their hobby CDs\n\n\nSo they're yakking and yakking and yakking\n\n<$A> \n\nOver the phone nuh\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n\nThey were yakking in the room so I just <unclear> word </unclear>\nleft their recorder there\n\n<$A> \n\nReally\n\n<$B> \n\nIt was so wonderful\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nAll the scarly all came out\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I know\n\n\nFor for ours worse because we I taped the fam\n\n\nYou see if it's just me and my parents then it's it's okay you see\n\n\nBut then my godma came into the picture and then her friend came\ninto the picture and then everybody started talking\n\n\nSo there was a mixture Teochew you know English <unclear> word\n</unclear> <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nIt's quite <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nYou see when my relatives get together you hear Cantonese Baba\nEnglish\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nThen I speak to my Cantonese relatives in Baba\n\n<$A> \n\nYa boy that yesterday\n\n\nI saw the the docu you know\n\n<$B> \n\nWhich one\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm Archie's mental or illness in\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> what do you think\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's very bad\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy\n\n<$A> \n\nI didn't even have time to think about the structure\n\n\nI didn't even have time to think about the <unclear> word\n</unclear> or <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nThe the picture's very rushed very emotional right\n\n<$A> \n\nNo I I just that ethical problem put me off because she did\n\n\nI I I don't know whether <unclear> word </unclear> told you\n\n<$B> \n\nI heard she I heard she <unclear> word </unclear> the faces or\nblotched out the faces but then on\n\n<$A> \n\nOn other shots I saw them\n\n<$B> \n\nThen what's the point\n\n<$A> \n\nSee she had this media case study okay\n\n\nThis uh mentally ill man okay\n\n\nHe he uh okay she when she introduced him that time you could see\nthat she didn't really want to show his face you see\n\n\nThat's fine\n\n\nAnd then she showed one part where she's introducing the mother you\nsee\n\n\nSo you think there is nothing wrong you know because uhm she didn't\nreally set out to hide their faces you see\n\n\nSo there's this shot of the mother walking you see walking to uh\nthe the dining table okay to to get medicine for the son\n\n\nAnd she walked towards the dining table\n\n\nYou can see obviously that that you know the lights all coming from\nthe window you know\n\n\nSo if they they wanted to like cover her face <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n\nOkay that's fine\n\n<$B> \n\nThen\n\n\nThen after that\n\n<$A> \n\nYou can't see her because she cut to her legs walking and then\ncut to her shot of her at the table already you see\n\n\nThe next thing you know they cut to this shot of her where the\ncamera was taking by the side\n\n\nSo it's already quite dark you know the glow\n\n\nUh you know the glare and all that is no longer there you know and\nyou could see the mother\n\n\nYou could see the mother and then she says Ah Seng uh you know come\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat's the point like that\n\n<$A> \n\nYou see\n\n\nNo see so for for me I thought that this is nothing you know I\nthought that there was no attempt actually you know to to hide their face you\nknow\n\n\nThen when the interview came on it was in dark silhouette and the\nwoman was speaking very emotionally\n\n\nShe cried you see\n\n\nYou know what I mean or not\n\n\nShe's speaking and then she was crying you see\n\n\nThen you knew oh no she was supposed to hide the woman's face\n\n\nBut how come I saw\n\n<$B> \n\nMaybe you should ask Archie\n\n<$A> \n\nMust you know\n\n\nI I'm going to tell\n\n\nI'm I think it's ethical problem because I I\n\n<$B> \n\nUnless the lady agreed to be filmed later on\n\n<$A> \n\nI can put me off\n\n<$B> \n\nOr either that or she\n\n<$A> \n\nNo but if she agreed\n\n<$B> \n\ndidn't she didn't tell her what she's filming\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's bluff lah come on you know\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's quite\n\n\nIt's very unfair to the family what\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's very unfair and then never mind you know\n\n\nOkay then you see you know\n\n\nThere's this uhm then after that they cut away to the mother\ntalking about her\n\n\nThe her her psycho son right\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nSo he he's at the void deck you know downstairs you know those\nstone seats\n\n<$B> \n\nYa ya\n\n<$A> \n\nSo he's puffing away you see\n\n<$B> \n\nAh then\n\n<$A> \n\nSo they cut to this wide shot he's alone talking to himself\nsmoking wide shot but the angle the camera is high you see\n\n<$B> \n\nUh huh\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd you can see the man's face\n\n<$B> \n\n\n\n<$A> \n\nYou see and then later they cut to his eyes then they cut to\nhis his hands holding the cigarettes\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then you can see the face\n\n<$A> \n\nThen slowly it's like photo fade\n\n\nYou're beginning to see the whole face you know\n\n<$B> \n\nThen what's the point\n\n<$A> \n\nI was so disgusted you know and then they cut from another\npart\n\n\nOkay where he's talking to himself in hawker centre okay\n\n\nShe took a back shot so obviously she didn't want to show his face\n\n<$B> \n\nBut in in terms of dealing with issues was it\n\n<$A> \n\nI was so upset with that I didn't even think much of the\nissues you know\n\n\nSo I was I was thinking it's so disgusting you know and the\nproblem is is\n\n<$B> \n\nIs the whole series over\n\n<$A> \n\nNo over already\n\n<$B> \n\nHow many\n\n\nThree only uh\n\n<$A> \n\nThree\n\n\nThe divorce one just finished\n\n<$B> \n\nHow was the divorce one\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't know lah but you know very depressing lah\n\n\nEntire three-week you know the way they did the trainers you know\n\n\nWhoa very sad\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's the way it is what\n\n<$A> \n\nBut anyway the the mentally ill one in terms of issues\n\n\nI felt that I didn't learn anything more\n\n\nIt's like the usual things that you would ask the old you know\nmentally ill people\n\n<$B> \n\nHow you cope the difficulty\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no no not how they cope you know but uhm how how\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\ndifficult it is for them to like <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's all lah\n\n<$A> \n\nYou see\n\n\nBut then it wasn't well-rounded because they kept on saying you\nknow from from the perspective\n\n<$B> \n\nSo it's just milking sympathy\n\n<$A> \n\nYa because they kept on saying that these poor chaps\n\n<$B> \n\nNot not hard\n\n\nHard look lah at at the\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know uh uh employers don't want to give them a a a a job\nyou know\n\n\nPoor things and all that you see\n\n<$B> \n\nSo it's just like mental illness awareness kind of thing\n\n\nNothing deeper\n\n<$A> \n\nThey didn't get the\n\n\nThey didn't get employers' point of view on why certain mentally\nill people\n\n<$B> \n\nThey're looking into it\n\n<$A> \n\nMay not be suitable\n\n\nThat is the one you know\n\n<$B> \n\nThey're doing\n\n<$A> \n\nYou must have an answer\n\n\nYour docu can't be one-sided what\n\n\nBut in the end you all saying that ya these poor chaps you know\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nTrying so\n\n\nHaving ya having a hard time you know\n\n\nCan't integrate into society\n\n\nIt's all their fault\n\n\nSo I I I don't know lah\n\n\nI\n\n<$B> \n\nAh I went for the health screening just now\n\n<$A> \n\nHow\n\n<$B> \n\nCholesterol

were uh were there lots of people\n\n<$A> \n\nOh ya\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nSo it's quite successful lah\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I think so\n\n<$B> \n\nActually uhm yuh TheatreWorks\n\n\nWas it Tay Tong or somebody who rang me up\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThey wanted Chinese opera you see\n\n<$A> \n\nHa\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nAiyoh \n\n<$B> \n\nBecause they thought opera on the hill

\n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSo I said we're very busy but if the timing fits uh might be\nwe could you see\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThen I asked him about pricing lah\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSupposing

the cost would go up\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm ya\n\n<$B> \n\nand if you've taped music of course it would be very cheap\nnuh\n\n<$A> \n\nNot nice ya\n\n<$B> \n\nBut won't be nice\n\n\nSo I thought you know taped music won't be so effective\n\n\nAnyway I've told them the cost but they never came back to me\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's probably too expensive\n\n<$B> \n\nProbably too expensive\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I wonder

it\n\n<$A> \n\nYa everything clashes with Film Fes\n\n\nYa ya everything clashes with Film Fes lor\n\n\nThen just before Film Fes\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nat that European Community Film Fes\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nBut that was before the Film Fes so it's not so bad you see\n\n<$A> \n\nYa ya but then it's like you know\n\n<$B> \n\nToo close\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n\nThen you got to spend so much money\n\n<$B> \n\nuhm and so much time\n\n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nIs that Film Fes is still on uh\n\n<$A> \n\nYep until next Sunday\n\n<$B> \n\nOh so it really clashes uh\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know why they don't space it out properly uh\n\n<$A> \n\nYa don't know lah\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nThere's a lot of explanations and and all that\n\n\nThen June got Arts Fes\n\n<$B> \n\nYa June got Arts Fes so whoa this year full of fes\n\n\nTiring lah hor\n\n<$A> \n\nYa sometimes\n\n\nOkay lah\n\n\nI mean it's probably the same crowd who go to film fes and arts\nfes \n\n<$B> \n\nYa the same people what A lot of yuppies also go to this\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd it's amazing you know The shows uh most of the films are\nI think sold out you know\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nBut Film Fes usually like that\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nYou find it hard to guide  get tickets\n\n<$A> \n\nYa but then then it's like you know the rest of the year we\ndon't have very good stuff in the local cinemas\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nThen but then when the Film Fes comes around people snap up\nthe tickets So that means there is a market for for this kind of more unusual\nfilms\n\n<$B> \n\nNot really you know I mean because there's a film fes sort\nof people know that these things are on If you space it out and you put it on\nthe commercial market nuh\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nthen you may miss it you know\n\n<$A> \n\nMarket you then you must publicize it market it <unclear>\nword </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then the commercial market uh for this type of film uh\nit won't last long you see Couple of days uh Then by the time you get to know\nabout it it's off right\n\n<$A> \n\nYa That's why they they don't publicize their stuff properly\nespecially Cathay\n\n<$B> \n\nWhereas in the Film Fes it's all concentrated\n\n<$A> \n\nYa and they have publicity whereas like you know a lot of\ncommercial cinemas they don't publicize their films So couple of good films\ncome to Cathay you know\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\ngo to Picture House or whatever\n\n<$B> \n\nand then you miss\n\n<$A> \n\nthey're not publicized at all There's no write-up about them\nYou know nothing about them Three days later they're gone\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nSo I figured it out Cathay's tac tactic is uh they bring in\nthe big films right\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nand then in between the big films they throw in filler\nmovies\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nand I think that sometimes the filler movies are worth\nwatching People would go and watch if only you promote the movies I think you\ncan earn even more money\n\n<$B> \n\nBut maybe they think it's too much money to spend on\nadvertisements Ya\n\n<$A> \n\nYa But it's it's such a waste you know\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nSuch a waste", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "92684b59-3aba-4546-9b60-d353e71c66a9", "added":

now\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't blame her\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n\nShe was I've never seen her so\n\n\nWhen she get upset uh\n\n<$B> \n\nShe want to break down and cry right\n\n<$A> \n\nIf she get upset she'll like 'Yes you want talk to me'\n\n<$B> \n\nYa uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nNo why I'm why I'm annoyed about is that when I spoke to\nEnita\n\n<$B> \n\nEnita\n\n<$A> \n\nShe said she doesn't want to do it so okay fine\n\n\nUhm she said then she said like actually Shoberth can do it but\nit's just that they didn't communicate properly and all that with Beng Kiang\nall that\n\n\nI said Whatever\n\n\nThen I said\n\n\nThen she explained\n\n\nI said No you don't have to explain\n\n\nI I'll just do it\n\n\nShe said Why are you not upset\n\n\nI said Well I'd rather not get emotional about these things\n\n\nI I'll just be functional and and and detached and practical\n\n\nThen she said like Okay that's good\n\n\nThen uhm she said Will you call Beng Kiang\n\n\nI said I will call Beng Kiang but not to tell her that you don't\nwant to do it but I think you should call her and tell her that you don't\nwant to do it\n\n\nBut I'll call Beng Kiang later and just talk about\n\n\nOkay so now what we do\n\n\nBut what I'm most annoyed about is that she called Beng Kiang and\nshe told Beng Kiang\n\n<$B> \n\nTo call\n\n<$A> \n\nThat I will talk to her you know and said Beng Kiang called\nme <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nYes you want to talk to me\n\n\nI said uhm Ya did Enita call you\n\n\nSaid she said Yes\n\n\nThen I said uhm so did did she tell you she can't do it\n\n\nShe said Yes so you want to talk to me about what\n\n\nYou know like uh\n\n\nYa I thought we know you'd better talk about what other\npossibilites there are and all that kind of thing\n\n<$B> \n\nNo what what I was really annoyed with Enita was was okay she\nshe she blamed Beng Kiang for the Shobun thing\n\n\nYou know what I mean\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nAs in like it's it's uhm uhm they never communicate\n\n\nShe never explain properly to her and now because at the end of\nthe day <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nWhat it means is Enita cannot go on holiday\n\n\nYou know what I mean or not\n\n\nI can't help thinking that even if she's concerned about Shobun\n\n\nI can't help thinking that that that at the end of the day it's\nbecause if or or it doesn't work out she cannot go on holiday\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know is it and this is very irritating because it's irres\n\n\nI still feel it's irres(irresponsible)\n\n\nThat's why she doesn't want to talk to me about it you see\n\n\nBecause I told her yesterday I think you should do it\n\n<$A> \n\nNo but I don't want to be\n\n\nI don't want to like tell people you must do you must not do\n\n\nIf you don't want to do don't do just say No or Yes\n\n\nI don't want to even hear reasons because you are adult enough to\nto to to go and rationalize this and you know\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nNo no\n\n\nBecause the thing is that why why I felt that uhm one of us had to\nsay it was because uhm on Beng Kiang's behalf you see because I think Beng\nKiang felt that it's it's very difficult\n\n\nBecause Beng Kiang will feel that at the end of the day that we\ndidn't we didn't uhm tsk do anything about it\n\n<$A> \n\nNo but these things you just have to like live with it kind\n\n\nI mean look at Those who can't teach wants his face pulled out\nlike two weeks before like what I mean you go to him and you say No you must\nnot leave that kind of thing <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nI think you should stay and all that\n\n<$B> \n\nNo that's different you see but then you see that's different\nbecause you you are involved in it\n\n\nAlvin's involved in it and we explained blah blah blah blah right\n\n\nThe problem with this Beng Kiang thing is that it's Enita you see\n\n\nEnita is supposed to be one of us kind of thing and at and while\nwhile we we receive <unclear> word </unclear> production support and all that\n\n\nThen it's like Beng Kiang says ya\n\n\nUhm you know she asked me that day Is is Enita always like that\n\n\nDoes she do this very often\n\n\nI said No as far as I know\n\n\nI said she she does have some time constraints and stuff\n\n\nThat's why in in reference to the group she's very clear about it\n\n\nShe she cannot come for this she cannot come for that\n\n\nIt's okay you see\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nBut she's clear from the onstart\n\n\nBut I said I guess this is an unusual circumstance because she\nalso didn't expect to be here <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nTo be given the luxury of leave suddenly you see\n\n\nYou know what I mean\n\n\nBut then it's like if we all if we if we don't say that uhm you\nhave a responsibility to do it then it's like we are being lax you see\n\n\nYou know what I mean\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd it's not as if we're offering a lot of of of uhm uhm\nalternatives to Beng Kiang\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's it's at this moment we're very stretched for <unclear>\nword </unclear> as if we have <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nAnd I told I told Enita there\n\n\nAnd then I said I said I I have to admit\n\n\nMy main priority at that point <unclear> word </unclear> one week\nago is is uhm Dawn\n\n\nBecause Dawn hasn't even started you see and and the way Enita put\nit is like Okay so the script is not written yet you know so it's alright if\nI pull out\n\n\nIt's not true you see and I I so I told Beng Kiang I know why\nshe's very panicky\n\n\nSo I said let's\n\n\nI I told Beng Kiang that day in in the that uhm shop\n\n\nEven if it's not Enita if it's Shoberth whoever\n\n\nI said Your main priority now is to is to polish up the cast and\nget the show on the road because she said Ya then the script <unclear> word\n</unclear> in the script will be <unclear> word </unclear> and all that\n\n\nI said But\n\n\nI said This is the is you know for the audience\n\n\nYou you want the audience <unclear> word </unclear> to find out\nwhether it's going to be a good script or not right\n\n\nSo you must like you\n\n\nYou can't give <unclear> word </unclear> make house situation\n<unclear> word </unclear> where everybody says Aiyah don't know\n\n\nThis part didn't work\n\n\nDon't know whether it's the cast the director or the or the script\nkind of thing\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nSo I said if the direction is good and the the cast is good\nthen at least we can say Ah okay it's the script\n\n\nThis is the problem where but that's constructive you see\n\n\nSo ya lah that's why\n\n<$A> \n\nSo now we just meet someone who is free for two weeks and who\nis good and who can just can just do it\n\n<$B> \n\nYa but that's easier said than done\n\n<$A> \n\nTomorrow morning lah\n\n\nWhat's happening tomorrow morning\n\n\nAbout just <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\nOkay No that's why I'm very I'm very I'm very uhm confused\nright now about this because it's like do we do we find someone for her or is\nShoberth doing it or what\n\n<$A> \n\nNo she said she'll go and talk to Shoberth and Beng Kiang\nBeng Kiang and if Shoberth can't do it then we'll find someone lah\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay so <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nI told her I said I will ask Kah Wai She said no it's not a\nrole for Kah Wai I said okay Then we just have to think of someone\n\n<$B> \n\nJowee\n\n<$A>

months ago I thought this thing's off\n\n\nI called up and uh Rosrena told me that she'll be resigning\n\n\nSo I think the the whole thing got quiet off you know\n\n<$A> \n\nObviously\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd

\n\nThat's why\n\n<$A> \n\nI'll have to uh the the lady who helped me with the one of my\nteam members who helped me with the some transparencies\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's a very uh that's

was uh at this uh similar SYBEX\n\n\nThere was a conference uhm I think what could have made a\ndifference was that that one uh the conference itself the CIDB was a problem\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm uhm

\n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause there are so many buildings coming up you see\n\n\nApart from building uh private property\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nuh people are not building commercial\n\n\nThere's just too much coming up uh\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nDo you see a trend uh downward movement for residential\n\n<$A> \n\nUh well we thought that and I thought that it will it'll go\ndown\n\n\nit didn't go down\n\n<$B> \n\nYa it seems strong uh\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I think\n\n<$B> \n\nSurprisingly\n\n<$A> \n\nI think uh what we did not expect was that the uh we had to\ngo by supply demand plus uh the confidence factor which is related to the\neconomic performance\n\n\nAnd uh we had to go by what the government was projecting that is\nthat there was there will be a bit of slowdown but that slowdown didn't\nhappen\n\n\nI think that is <unclear> word </unclear> because towards end of\nlast year October onwards uh the market was very quiet\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd uh we we knew that the developers were giving uh very\ngood discounts twenty percent which means definitely there was dropping\nalready\n\n\nIf it carried on uh to January February it would drop you see\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nBut uh what happened was the projected drop by one percent of\nthe GNP did not happen because it was supposed to be the earlier uh expected\ngrowth rate of say five percent was revised even downwards you know\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nUh but what what is apparent now the last the first three\nmonths of the year uh we might have achieved more than the original even five\npercent you know\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nSo because of that so although the market is quiet people\nfelt uh I mean everybody is still\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nIs still very well-to-do right\n\n\nBetter start buying\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I think this slowdown is not that it didn't happen\n\n\nI think this slowdown is delayed you know\n\n\nHuh\n\n<$A> \n\nIs delayed\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nBut the question is how long the delay <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n\nMy my own feeling is that because of the sudden boost in\nconfidence uh\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nuh people who would have uh been willing to wait uh is\nprobably not uh sorry not going to wait too long\n\n\nSo the level of demand would be a bit higher\n\n<$B> \n\nTo pick up\n\n<$A> \n\nya so that uh instead of stabilising and then drops slightly\nuh it might actually continue to keep up and then level off\n\n\nInstead of instead of level and down it would be up and level\n\n\nYou see the complexion is different\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd uh what I did was uh the other day when the report came\nup uh\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nI was surprised also what\n\n\nI didn't I thought it would stabilise\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nBut not you know\n\n\nUh only when the economic results came out then but what we did\nwas to go back look at the figures again\n\n\nAnd I think that the the level of demand we may have\nunderestimated cos' we're basing on historical figures and give a certain uh\nwhat we would expect to be a normal increase say instead of three thousand\nthree thousand five\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\napartments uh\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nand condominiums uh demanded every year we give a certain\nincrease of maybe ten twenty percent\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nto allow for income group and that will give maybe about\nclose to four thousand as against uh expected supply of five thousand or more\n\n\nThat obviously would be a serious over-supply but looks like the\ndemand may we may have to revise it to say four four four five you know\n\n\nLooking at the past three months uh\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nSo if you look at four five as against the supply of five\nthousand it's slightly above five thousand\n\n\nThe over-supply is not not sufficient to bring price down\n\n<$B> \n\nDo you think there'll be a I think uh after this report the\nlevel will even go higher\n\n<$A> \n\nUh huh that's one reason\n\n\nThe other factor is that the the other day although uh it was not\nsplashed uh but it was announced the CPF interest rates uh would be reduced\nto below three percent or below four percent is it\n\n<$B> \n\nBelow four\n\n<$A> \n\nCurrently it's four plus\n\n\nIt'll be reduced to three point nine or something like that\n\n\nThat has a big effect you know\n\n<$B> \n\nYes yes ya\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause from people's point of view why should I still leave\nmoney inside\n\n\nIt's just not earning enough return\n\n\nAnd even if the property market should go down and later come up\nagain never mind just put in first\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's why\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I think it will have an effect\n\n\nThey're actually encouraging more property investment\n\n\nI think so\n\n<$B> \n\nYa because that will be a major factor because it's miserable\n\n\nYou're talking about three plus uh\n\n<$A> \n\nCos' three plus is like \n\n\nJust <unclear> word </unclear> probably covering inflation also\n\n<$B> \n\nNo growth you know\n\n\nConsider it's a fixed deposit for twenty years uh\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's uh it's crazy you know\n\n<$A> \n\nNo growth ya\n\n\n'Cos any rational person\n\n\nIf I if I have money and I have a if I can afford lah if can't\nafford can't be helped\n\n\nIf I can afford and I can take out the money I will because while\nwe talk about possible slowdown uh\n\n\nBut uh in the longer term we know it's going up also once that uh\nover-supply is going to be taken up\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's why\n\n\nBut I still think that this slowdown will come lah\n\n<$A> \n\nIt will\n\n<$B> \n\nIt will lah\n\n<$A> \n\nIt will of course the question is the effect\n\n\nWhat is the effect\n\n<$B> \n\nPerhaps now it sort of smooth over you know\n\n<$A> \n\nYa <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nrather than have a sharp\n\n<$A> \n\nInstead of like that uh it'll just bends a little bit\n\n\nThe other side is really quite near if you look at you can just\nswim across\n\n\nI think the idea of having this is nice but somehow as you're\nsaying that the elements are not related at all\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's why\n\n\nAnd also I think it's too harsh\n\n<$A> \n\nYa too hard\n\n<$B> \n\nToo hard uh\n\n<$A> \n\nSo many concrete patches\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nAs our environment <unclear> word </unclear> goal we should have\nsort of some landscape and a few uh fountain you know uh like that uh\n\n<$A> \n\nThat's right that's right\n\n\nBe willing to spend uh\n\n\nThey always talk about cost cost cost\n\n<$B> \n\nThe problem is that they frequently want to spend but stop\nshort\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's as a result of which uh we don't have hundred percent\n\n\nWe don't have distinction\n\n\nWe always As or Bs\n\n\nThat's a problem you know\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nBut uh but uh <unclear> word </unclear> of the other side the\nterminal is also very hard you know\n\n<$A> \n\nYa it is hard\n\n<$B> \n\nYa I find that I find that it's\n\n<$A> \n\nIf you walk around looks nice but you you don't feel very\ncosy\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm ya that's right\n\n\nThe problem is that I think we we always look at other other\nsystem Australia elsewhere and try to try to sort of emulate you know uh\n\n\nBut fail badly because we don't uh don't sort of modify to suit\nour own condition\n\n\nBut in in in acoustic well it's the same thing and I think\nthere're a lot of other things you know\n\n\nUhm we don't seem to have uh mature from there although I suppose\nthis will come\n\n\nTakes some time\n\n\nBut right now I think uh still the the flight <unclear> word\n</unclear> is not right\n\n\nBut I I'm won I'm wondering uh whether this this thing will be\nwill happen because we seem to have reached our sort of prime you know prime\nnation moving into an economic development you know \n\n<$A> \n\nI think so ya I think so\n\n<$B> \n\nYes <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nand we'll not we'll not the growth hub\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's right And if you're not cashing in on this uh you may\ngrow old very quickly\n\n<$A> \n\nI think so ya\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nA <unclear> word </unclear> development\n\n<$A> \n\nThat's why I was\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd I think it's now the the other nation that can learn\nfrom our past\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nand and and all that That's why yesterday Sarawak this chap\nwas telling that you know they're very keen to understand our system and see\nhow we work because there're things that they can learn you know like\nconservation\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nNow they can look into their own conservation problem and\nthey can plan a conservation strategy\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nyou know based on our lesson\n\n<$A> \n\nYa lah ya that's right right Oh ya I I have been giving\ncouple of data and uh\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's why I said I have been\n\n<$A> \n\nKL KL also\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's why\n\n<$A> \n\nThey are very keen and\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nin fact they have a lot of good buildings\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's why\n\n<$A> \n\nthat are not torn down unlike us we were going at a very hot\npace Penang also In fact uh just before this our KL office called 'Can you\nhelp in this uh just giving some info lah on conservation Uh how they should\ndo it in Penang you know I said no we're

diskette\n\n<$B> \n\nShe what\n\n\nShe what\n\n\nNo because she needed memory for her printer you see\n\n\nSo she wiped off what's in the hard disk and stored inside the\ndiskette\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then the printer needs more memory space now\n\n\nSo I don't know what she's going to do\n\n<$A> \n\nOh so the printer\n\n<$B> \n\ntakes up some memory space you see\n\n<$A> \n\nSo why doesn't she get a printer that doesn't take up so much\nspace\n\n<$B> \n\nI think basically printers do\n\n<$A> \n\nOh so it was no good to use a lap to buy a laptop right\n\n<$B> \n\nI

about men in general\n\n<$A>\n\nUhm a lot of weirdoes lah\n\n\nNot all of them are weirdoes you know\n\n<$B>\n\nNo but you see from these three I mean what gives them the\nright to just come up and pass comments on or you know intimidate you in any\nway\n\n\nYou know like like I think you you should have given it to him\n\n\nYou know when he like oh so cute so <unclear> word </unclear> just\nlike just like jerlin at him or like just don't give face just walk\n\n<$A>\n\nI did not\n\n\nThat's why I I I think so\n\n\nI I mean if uhm if you were to tell me of a situation I would do I\nwould do it lah\n\n\nBut faced with the same with with the circumstances uh I dare not\nyou know\n\n<$B>\n\n\nBut do you remember uhm Mary as we were coming up we we were\ngoing to Clementi MRT ya then there was this guy just behind us\n\n<$C>\n\nYep\n\n<$B>\n\nAnd so he was so close behind us you see and we were going up\nthe escalator\n\n\nSo like when both of us just stand and just look at him you know he\nsaid hello\n\n<$C>\n\nYou know he said hello you know\n\n<$B>\n\n\nHe said hello\n\n<$C>\n\nNo you know what made me turn\n\n\nHe said hello uh like uh\n\n\nI heard a voice from like out of nowhere\n\n\nSo I turned around\n\n\nThen he smiled\n\n\nSo I thought like oh maybe you you knew him\n\n<$A>\n\nBut then you didn't\n\n<$B>\n\nNo\n\n\nThen we just let it go <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A>\n\nThat's how uh\n\n<$B>\n\nYa\n\n<$C>\n\nYa\n\n<$A>\n\nThen what did he do\n\n<$B>\n\nThen we we just turned back lah we just turned back we just\n\n<$C>\n\nI thought you knew him uh then why why why so funny strangers\ncould say hello to strangers\n\n<$B>\n\nDo you know but he was standing very close behind us you know\n\n<$C>\n\nYa ya ya\n\n<$B>\n\nIt's like not not natural you know it's not like peak hour\nspoonerism you know\n\n<$C>\n\nHe even said hello\n\n\nSo I thought like you knew that person and he like give a smile so\nlike stupidly I smiled\n\n<$B>\n\nYou actually smiled\n\n<$C>\n\nNo like\n\n<$B>\n\nI just stand I just stand back without any\n\n<$C>\n\nAny question lah\n\n\nWasn't like like ah like that\n\n<$A>\n\nSo the moral of the story stay home uh\n\n<$B>\n\nNo it's not to stay home but what is the moral of the story\nMary\n\n<$C>\n\nThe moral of the story is that we should say hello to strange\nmen also\n\n\nWe should initiative\n\n<$A>\n\nNo no the desirable ones don't say hi to you\n\n<$B>\n\nNo ya no no no no\n\n\nYou know what you should do\n\n\nYou know what you should do\n\n\nYou should just shock them you know\n\n<$A>\n\nTell anyone and do what\n\n<$B>\n\nYou just shock them like how maybe you say oh hello\n\n<$C>\n\nThen they say you ask for it\n\n\nIf anything happens\n\n<$A>\n\nYa\n\n<$B>\n\nBecause they're always bigger than us basically admitted you\nhave to face\n\n<$A>\n\nYa that's true that's true\n\n<$C>\n\nYa\n\n\nSo they will like if anything happens anything bad\n\n<$B>\n\nBut there were two of us\n\n\nWhat two of us and only there's one of him what\n\n\nAlthough he was quite he was quite tall lah but still\n\n<$A>\n\nDidn't he follow you\n\n<$B>\n\nNo he didn't\n\n<$C>\n\nThen we can just run and shout for help\n\n<$B>\n\nI think maybe\n\n<$A>\n\nYa cos you see I uh I I was alone so I dare not do anything\nfunny you see\n\n<$B>\n\nNo but you don't have to like give him you don't have to give\nhim face in the first place what\n\n\nYou could just like turn around\n\n\nYou know what I usually do\n\n\nI I don't even like jerlin or anything\n\n\nI just like just turn around like oh a blank face you know oh I\ndidn't see you I I I see right through you and just turn\n\n\nSo maybe the person thought I was retarded or something or person\nquickly thought I didn't hear you if I just you know like so you can't say\nthat I provoke you in any way or I didn't you know that kind of thing\n\n<$C>\n\nUhm uhh\n\n<$B>\n\nAnd I don't like walk very fast or anything\n\n\nJust like pretend lah or I just see through the person like that\n\n<$C>\n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B>\n\nBut you see this is the thing you see\n\n\nWhy should women <unclear> word </unclear> up with this kind of\nthing\n\n\nYou know why should should a man just come up and just say oh hi\nsexy or hi cute\n\n\nI mean how come\n\n<$C>\n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B>\n\nWhat gives them the

it\n\n<$A> \n\nMaybe uh\n\n<$B> \n\nOh because uh\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> David\n\n<$B> \n\nDavid is going to\n\n\nDavid says he will stop at the MRT station\n\n<$A> \n\nYa but I am sure\n\n<$B> \n\nOh but he ya uh\n\n<$A> \n\nHe asked you to give Jenson a call right\n\n<$B> \n\nYa Jenson <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> we should have a dial uh question\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nSeriously you consider about the the DL <unclear> word\n</unclear> uh\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay lah\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> can record it uh\n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nNo you have to go through the training phase first you know\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat what training phase\n\n<$A> \n\nThere must be training what\n\n\nThey teach you how to do it\n\n\nFor you probably not much uh\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nBut they will teach you how to do it\n\n<$B> \n\nHow long is the training phase\n\n<$A> \n\nNo it is it is continuous what\n\n<$B> \n\nOh you mean I I start in August\n\n<$A> \n\nYa we are leading on Tuesday uh\n\n\nOkay yes Sir <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nSo like like I was saying they came to conduct the sessions uh who\nwe meet every Tuesday uh\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nSo we can you will join us for every Tuesday\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uh\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then uh probably for a for two or three sessions uh\n\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> time you are comfortable and then you\nwill lead the class or co-lead together with somebody else's uh\n\n\nSo in this case you are probably co- lead with me first\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I thought you are at at uh STL\n\n<$A> \n\nOh ya\n\n\nThen then you probably do it together with Sin Tiong uh\n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n\nBut Sin Tiong will be promoted to DL\n\n<$A> \n\nHe is he is always been with DL you know\n\n<$B> \n\nOh is it\n\n<$A> \n\nYa it is just that\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nIt is just that\n\n<$B> \n\nThat he is too busy to or there are too many\n\n<$A> \n\nNo because there are there are <unclear> word </unclear> too\nmany he so he co- he co- he co-teach together with me\n\n\nSo if I can't uh he I can't do it on those days then he will do it\nlah\n\n<$B> \n\nSo he should be finished his exams soon right\n\n<$A> \n\nJune uh\n\n<$B> \n\nJune uh ya\n\n<$A> \n\nHopefully he passed I hope\n\n<$B> \n\nHopefully he passed I hope <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nProbably would lah\n\n<$B> \n\nIf he passed then we will we celebrate with him\n\n\nIf not we will moan with him uh\n\n<$A> \n\nAh don't forget me\n\n<$B> \n\nDon't worry uh I will I will cut for you\n\n<$A> \n\nAugust uh\n\n\nAugust August twentieth we will be starting again\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nSo uh\n\n\nIf you want then you probably can join us in August uh\n\n<$B> \n\nThat will give me a lot of time to think about it\n\n<$A> \n\nThe communal-wise not too bad now right\n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nYou are confused <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nUh all right\n\n<$A> \n\nHuh\n\n<$B> \n\nI am I may not want to go to Ministry of Labour for my\nattachment uh\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy not\n\n<$B> \n\nDon't know whether got time\n\n\nMaybe later next year lah\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy got no time\n\n\nYou still got a lot of time\n\n<$B> \n\nGot lah got lah\n\n<$A> \n\nIf you don't do it now you won't do it later you know\n\n<$B> \n\nI know\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd I still find it very useful because the only person that\nstill still maintains that contact uh\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> uh is only is only me uh me and Tze\nPeng that kind of uh\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uh\n\n<$A> \n\nBut Tze Peng one is still quite far\n\n\nTze Peng only contacts within <unclear> word </unclear> for two\ndays you see\n\n<$B> \n\nI thought I will go before September because I want to\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nI want to attend the Stats course one more time\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nYa I want to go after that\n\n<$A> \n\nHuh but it must be a\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> not more than three months you know\n\n<$A> \n\nHuh ya but it must be a four month kind of a attachment\notherwise\n\n<$B> \n\nAh yes\n\n<$A> \n\nOtherwise you won't get to know the whole mechanics you know\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nI but he they when I talked to Jerry and the they didn't they\ndidn't sound very keen uh\n\n<$A> \n\nMaybe I talk to him again\n\n<$B> \n\nNo actually they say okay you know\n\n\nIt is good you know\n\n\nBut they they cautioned me in that I should not uh look at the\nadministrative side of it so much\n\n<$A> \n\nTrue ah true ah\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nBut it is not the administrative\n\n<$B> \n\nYa more for uh my own experience uh\n\n<$A> \n\nAh it is actually for the work experience\n\n<$B> \n\nExposure\n\n<$A> \n\nHow you go about investigating a case\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nYa it is <unclear> word </unclear> that you can actually see\na the whole area of factory\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nWhich you will never get to see here\n\n\nMoving out sub-factories <unclear> word </unclear> so it's\nactually very very narrow uh\n\n\nThe only ones that you see actually <unclear> word </unclear> on\nand off you get to see a few electronics factories and that is about it\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n\nUnless I go myself lah\n\n<$A> \n\nNo you can't go <unclear> word </unclear> you see\n\n<$B> \n\nYa difficult lah\n\n<$A> \n\nNo you can't you can't just <unclear> word </unclear> you\ncan't just <unclear> word </unclear> into the factory uh\n\n<$B> \n\nYa ya\n\n\nQuite difficult lah\n\n\nSo I think I was thinking of starting in September October and\nNovember\n\n<$A> \n\nProbably actually you may want to speak to Hock Siang and\nfind out what is the best time to go uh\n\n<$B> \n\nYa he he\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause they have their peak periods and and down period\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nUh the peak period meaning a lot of staff going on leave that\nkind of thing\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nGet a chance to do more you see\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause if you are there and everybody is there uh then you\nyou won't have much you won't have much to do uh\n\n<$B> \n\nActually I have a <unclear> word </unclear> I I can take over\n\n\nWhat is his name uh\n\n\nThat guy\n\n<$A> \n\nPeter Tay\n\n<$B> \n\nAh Peter Tay while he is doing his full-time course uh\n\n<$A> \n\nAh ya he is starting what he is starting from July\n\n<$B> \n\nYa <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nSo June the whole month the whole\n\n\nPractically the whole year\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm they will love your your presence to a certain extent\n\n<$B> \n\nSo what do they do there\n\n\nQuite busy uh\n\n<$A> \n\nNo lah not too too bad\n\n\nBut you can investigate some of the case actually will be good\n\n\nThey probably will not allow you to investigate the whole case uh\n\n\nBut you can tag along you see\n\n\nYou can even go with Hock Siang or go with people like Siok Lin\nwho won't mind showing you the ropes uh\n\n<$B> \n\nThat is the thing you see\n\n\nIf I go uh for because I talked to Hock Siang\n\n\nHe said it will take me at least one or two months right to be\nfamiliar to be able to be on my own uh\n\n\nThat is what that is how long Peter Tay took\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nTwo three months right\n\n<$A> \n\nBut but\n\n<$B> \n\nYou won't say I won't be useful to them\n\n\nThat is the problem right\n\n<$A> \n\nUh certainly you won't be that useful lah\n\n\nBut one one of the thing that you can offer them is that you can\ntry to help them out to upgrade their computer system\n\n<$B> \n\nAiyah <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd you are using D Base they use D Base\n\n\nYou are quite familiar right\n\n<$B> \n\nWhoa I'm very familiar with D Base\n\n<$A> \n\nUh\n\n\nLeast familiar\n\n<$B> \n\nVery very familiar\n\n<$A> \n\nAh that is that is very good what because\n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nThe only one that is helping them out now is this uh fifty\nsomething year old man who is retiring soon\n\n<$B> \n\nHuh\n\n\nReally\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay lah\n\n\nI don't mind I\n\n<$A> \n\nYou\n\n<$B> \n\nCos I am qualified because when I asked last spoke to Hock\nSiang in uh <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nHe said six months will be nice lah because six months will be a\nreal help to them rather than uh uhm uhm might be just a burden to them\n\n<$A> \n\nNo but you won't be a burden uh if you if you just tag along\nyou see\n\n<$B> \n\nYa lah\n\n<$A> \n\nIn all their visits that kind of thing\n\n<$B> \n\nYa true lah\n\n<$A> \n\nUh then at the during the times when you are free\n\n\nIf you can help them out on the computer system \n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nThat side of the people will appreciate that because uh\nprior to this this guy uh Chee Lan uh somebody else did it for them\n\n\nI mean this engineer you know and he spent most of this time just\ndoing all these thing\n\n\nAnd then he got so <unclear> word </unclear> he went he quit you\nknow\n\n\nHe quit the job and went to do a Diploma in the in Artificial\nIntelligence\n\n<$B> \n\nIs it\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nIISS\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nYa graduated\n\n\nAnd they have enough they have enough systems around what\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nyou might like to try\n\n<$B> \n\nCos the other thing I have to plan my dissertation\n\n\nI don't want to don't want to schedule my dissertation before\nMarch next year\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n\nJanuary lah", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "8c1f4221-05d2-48fe-98d4-108a9852bd47", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nYou've got a minute\n\n<$B> \n\nSure\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat do you want to talk about\n\n<$A> \n\nOh that's I just was wondering whether we could discuss our\nprojects so we know what we are all doing\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay why don't you go ahead first\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm I am trying to figure out something to do for my\ndissertation\n\n<$B> \n\nI thought you already had your health promotion project in mind\n\n<$A> \n\nYa ya but I need to find out what exactly I want to do with it\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat about the uh the company that had approached you\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nIs it <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nNo the one that uh I was working with Kai Hong and the big one that\nuh the boss was involved in\n\n<$A> \n\nIs it that one that students lead the project uh\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThe one you said was your going to be your main focus for the\nnext year\n\n<$A> \n\nOh that's a Johnson and Johnson company\n\n<$B> \n\nAh\n\n<$A> \n\nUh I don't know but that one is still tentative\n\n\nCan't wait that long\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat are they going to do\n\n<$A> \n\nThey want to start this healthy lifestyle thing which they've\ngot bought <unclear> word </unclear> it from Johnson and Johnson and uh might\nbe a bit difficult to get in uh\n\n\nToo big and then they're starting off\n\n\nUh it seems to be a lot of strings attached so it may not be such a\ngood idea at this point in time\n\n\nMay not be able to get it ready by my dissertation time\n\n\nSo thinking of NatSteel\n\n\nNatSteel is good because the management is very supportive but\nthere's a problem\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat's their that problem\n\n<$A> \n\nNatSteel is not a typical uh typical company\n\n\nI mean it's it's a very heavy industry\n\n\nIt's only iron and steel mill we have and then the turnover is\nshockingly low\n\n\nIt's about\n\n\nHow much\n\n\nLess than four percent\n\n<$B> \n\nBut that's good\n\n<$A> \n\nNo that's bad because I can't extrapolate you see\n\n\nUh on the one hand it's good for my for my project study\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's bad because at the end of it I can't really I can't\nreally extrapolate and say this is what other companies would have unless you\nfirst say that it should uh have a better turnover\n\n\nAnd then the population are older because they don't they don't\nresign\n\n\nSo it's an older population\n\n\nWhoa the average age is about forty years old\n\n\nThen companies like AT & T is about twentish and then turnover is\nabout thirty-five percent there\n\n\nAnd these are the majority that's your typical company\n\n\nThen if I take one like that and I have a high turnover I can't do\nanything either\n\n\nProblem\n\n<$B> \n\nWell but are there a group of companies with a low turnover\nlike NatSteel\n\n<$A> \n\nAs far as I know very few\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd and an older population\n\n\nSo it's it's the exception uh that that seems to be\n\n<$A> \n\nSeems to be\n\n\nFinance Steel is is a very good place to do a control study\n\n\nThey've got the structure for it\n\n\nI think I just going ahead\n\n<$B> \n\nI mean it's for your dissertation\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n\nUnless I finish it\n\n<$B> \n\nUh you can just\n\n<$A> \n\nBefore July\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nAnd then later on if you want to do a bigger one that you can\nextrapolate you can do it after the course\n\n<$A> \n\nCorrect\n\n\nSounds good\n\n\nWhat about yourself\n\n<$B> \n\nWell\n\n\nI've got all the data\n\n\nUh and I've done most of the sub <unclear> word </unclear> about\nhalf the analysis and I've <unclear> word </unclear> up the literature review\n\n\nThen I am going to do the results\n\n\nBut I've to do it I hope to get the first draft out by July because\nI understand that once the course starts there's very little time to do the\ndissertation\n\n\nI pity the the people who come with no data and have to actually go\nand start doing their survey from scratch because they really have to\nstruggle what with studying and doing the project at the same time\n\n<$A> \n\nI think there're very few of these\n\n\nThey seem to know\n\n\nThose who come\n\n\nMost of them come with their <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nMost of them do\n\n<$A> \n\nUnless it's a one-year thing\n\n\nSo at the end of it you've got three months\n\n<$B> \n\nNo it's nine months for me\n\n\nIt's nine it's still nine months this year\n\n<$A> \n\nUh\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nFrom next year it's one year\n\n<$A> \n\nOh you can always wait\n\n<$B> \n\nBut it doesn't matter because the last three months are only\nfor your dissertation\n\n<$A> \n\nOptional ya\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n\nYours is cervical\n\n<$B> \n\nCervical cancer screening\n\n<$A> \n\nScreening screening\n\n<$B> \n\nPep smear\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat do you find anyway\n\n<$B> \n\nI found that fifty-four point four percent of women in Pasir\nPanjang GRC have had a pep smear\n\n<$A> \n\nHow frequently\n\n<$B> \n\nIn their lives have ever had a pep smear\n\n\nFifty four point four percent and of this about never mind oh dear\nI've to lift this thing\n\n\nUh see how many have had it\n\n\nEighty-one point five percent had it within the last three years\n\n\nEight one point five percent of the fifty four\n\n<$A> \n\nOf the fifty four\n\n\nThat's not very good uh\n\n<$B> \n\nYa it's not great\n\n\nBut you see the the point I am going to make in this dissertation\nis it doesn't the utilization rate is not the main thing you see\n\n\nIt's catching the high risk groups and screening them\n\n\nAnd the high risk groups are the groups that are not being\nscreened at present\n\n<$A> \n\nWhich are\n\n<$B> \n\nWhich are the older you know the people\n\n\nWomen who are high risk for cervical cancer the older women lower\nsocio-economic status and uh the Indians\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay Pasir Panjang\n\n\nThere isn't a a <unclear> word </unclear> women clinic serving now\n\n<$B> \n\nClementi\n\n\nPasir Panjang means Clementi Ayer Rajah and Pasir Panjang\n\n<$A> \n\nUh okay\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd West Coast\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n\nOops\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nWell anyway it was quite interesting but now that I am\n\n\nOh dear what has happened\n\n\nNow that I am doing the analysis I found there are a lot of flaws\n\n\nUh oh I've been putting things on it and it's hung\n\n\nSwitch it off\n\n<$A> \n\nYou got it on back-up uh\n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nYou got you got it saved right\n\n<$B> \n\nYa I wasn't end the program ya\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay let's move on\n\n<$A> \n\nAre you doing anything else apart from that\n\n\nI heard something like what uhm what mac micro\n\n<$B> \n\nMolecular\n\n<$A> \n\nMolecular <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nMolecular epidemiology\n\n\nThat's right\n\n<$A> \n\nSo count how many molecules there are\n\n<$B> \n\nin epidemiology\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> present in that area community\n\n\nAre you going\n\n<$B> \n\nYep that's a fact\n\n<$A> \n\nFor the talk later on\n\n<$B> \n\nUh no I am going tomorrow\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> There's something tomorrow

</unclear>\n\n\nMid-June\n\n<$A> \n\nOn uhm molecular epidemiology\n\n<$B> \n\nNo it's not\n\n\nIt's on Cancer Pathology\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nMolecular epidemiology is a long-term kind of plan\n\n\nIf I still have to get the basics sorted out\n\n<$A> \n\nOh so you haven't started on it\n\n<$B> \n\nI haven't got any like any project you know\n\n\nUh uh I could have epidemiology but I am trying to get a feel of\nlab work you know\n\n<$A> \n\nYou've to do lab work\n\n\nKill mice and that sort of thing\n\n<$B> \n\nWell it's up to me I supposed whether ultimately I <unclear>\nword </unclear> want to do the killing and the <unclear> word </unclear> and\nall that kind of thing you see\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat sort of work is it\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's well it's molecular epidemiology is using bio marker\nbiological markers in epidemiology you see\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know applying epidemiology\n\n<$A> \n\nSounds like a lot of lab work\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nBlood tissue and things like that\n\n\nBut you have a choice you see\n\n\nYou can either be an epidemiologist who collaborates with lab\npeople to help them in projects\n\n\nSo you do collaborative work or you can actually go into lab work\nand do things like what Choon Hang and Chen Yang and all that are doing\n\n\nBut we have an epidemiology background\n\n\nSo you do molecular epidemiology\n\n<$A> \n\nI thought Chen Yang is here to do computer stuff\n\n<$B> \n\nNo he's not\n\n\nHe's doing uh work on liver\n\n<$A> \n\nOh is that right\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> ya <unclear> word </unclear> toxins\n\n<$A> \n\nBut he's in the WHO Computer Collaborating Centre thing\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's not Chen Yang\n\n\nThat's the other guy there\n\n\nUh the chap who lives who doesn't works in the computer lab\n\n\nHe look a bit like Chen Yang uh\n\n<$A> \n\nThat's not Chen Yang\n\n<$B> \n\nChen Yang is the one who works in that lab\n\n<$A> \n\nChen Yang is the <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nHe's not from China is it\n\n<$B> \n\nI think he was born in China but he's studied in the States\n\n<$A> \n\nOh that's Chen Yang\n\n\nThe one that comes in for tea\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nand all that\n\n\nAnd this chappy is not\n\n<$B> \n\nIs not\n\n\nHe's I don't know who he is\n\n\nI think he's direct from China maybe because he doesn't speak so\nmuch English\n\n<$A> \n\nOh and all along I thought Chen Yang\n\n\nSo what's Chen Yang's position here\n\n<$B> \n\nHe's a Research Scientist\n\n\nHe's got PhD and everything\n\n<$A> \n\nWhoa oh\n\n<$B> \n\nHe has right\n\n\nHe's Doctor right\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't know\n\n<$B> \n\nI think he is\n\n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nI always thought the other guy is Chen Yang\n\n\nI even called him Chen Yang\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n\nHe didn't correct you\n\n<$A> \n\nChen Yang has uh uh has bought himself a powerboat\n\n\nSo I went up to Ho Ho and thought was Chen Yang\n\n\nI said uh you bought a powerboat with this ah\n\n\nUh good morning\n\n\nThat was a very good interval <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nReally Chen Yang has bought himself a powerboat\n\n<$A> \n\nYa power book book the map\n\n<$B> \n\nOh I thought a powerboat\n\n\nThe sort that you ride on on the sea\n\n<$A> \n\nYa dear me dear me\n\n\nIn fact yours had a great <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nThe tall power of\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no no no that

so it'll be useful\n\n<$A> \n\nThe other one is uhm a study on acupuncture on smoking\nsensation/cessation <unclear> word </unclear> which uh\n\n<$B> \n\nIs it Martin\n\n<$A> \n\nMartin did the army one\n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nWe've got the one that was done by SAFRA which and I I've got\nthe figures with me for quite long already but this was posted out\n\n\nI didn't have a chance to work on it\n\n\nSo I want to work on that\n\n\nThen there's a chapter on health promotion for Prof Jerry's book\n\n\nThat one I have to collate\n\n\nSo I have to prioritise lah\n\n\nI think I do the chapter first because it's a what July deadline\nuh\n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nThen I've got to do uhm I have got to go through my draft\nagain for this John's article\n\n\nGot more articles than I am

work as long as there are statistics involved\n\n\nGot one that wanted me to collaborate with him on <unclear> word\n</unclear> cancer\n\n\nWants me to go into the cancer pull out all the cases uh that's\n<unclear> word </unclear> cancer and and relate it to hormonal level\n\n<$B> \n\nIn this hospital\n\n<$A> \n\nYa ya ya he'll\n\n<$B> \n\nYou mean he wants you to do the pulling out\n\n<$A>

they were so amazed\n\n\nAfter she left then you know I just met this girl who was going to\nschool you know all by herself\n\n\nAnd there was this little girl on the greyhound too and she cried\nall the way\n\n\nShe cried the first part of the way\n\n\nShe's crying like mad because her mum put her on the bus to go with\nher father\n\n\nReport her\n\n<$A> \n\nOh shit\n\n<$B> \n\nPoor girl\n\n<$A> \n\nHow old is she\n\n<$B> \n\nEight maybe nine\n\n<$A> \n\nTrauma\n\n<$C> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nShe I don't know\n\n\nI was taking the bus Greyhound from uh Chicago to Indiana\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat happened was I missed the the <unclear> word </unclear>\nwas so funny cos I took about I thought it would just take an hour for me to\nget from where I was in Chicago down downtown you see to the bus station\n\n\nLittle did I know when I went it was rush hour\n\n<$B> \n\nOh God\n\n<$A> \n\nI and the bus journey was like hell\n\n\nSo by the time I got there I got to the tracks\n\n\nI was like where's the train\n\n\nAnd then there was a station master there and I said uhm where is\nthe train that's bound for Indiana\n\n\nUhm Maam you see those tail lights over there\n\n\nYou're right\n\n\nThat's the one\n\n\nUh oh shit\n\n\nSo <unclear> word </unclear> greyhound and uhm this was during the\ntime when the uhm the floods had just been over and everyone was talking\nabout it\n\n\nSo I was seated right at the back and there were a couple of black\nguys and initially it was very I was like uh\n\n\nThen then after all they started talking uhm you know\n\n\nUh what what is that they said\n\n\nUhm ya that's it\n\n\nHad I been in Chicago earlier this uhm earlier this week I mean I\nwould have gone downtown and caught me a carp\n\n\nYou you know what happened to the floods\n\n\nYou hear about the floods\n\n<$B> \n\nDon't know\n\n<$C> \n\nYa ya they've\n\n\nThey flooded the building\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nThe entire basement\n\n\nSee what happened was uhm these jokers while building the subway\nhad driven a wall right down through uhm was it the city's foundations\n\n\nI don't know\n\n\nAnyway while they were building something they had driven a wall\nright down through a subway see\n\n\nA really old wall and that has lasted for about a decade until now\nbecause of the I think the river was coming upstream or something\n\n\nAnd then it just <unclear> word </unclear> the dam and all the\nbasement stuff all I mean everything you know from <unclear> word </unclear>\nto the area everything was\n\n<$C> \n\nDowntown Chicago right\n\n\nAll the basements were flooded\n\n<$A> \n\nMillions and millions of bucks and it's like Chicago isn't\nexactly a rich city either\n\n\nAnd uhm plus the riots and everything it just made things a lot\nworse\n\n\nSo ya ya it was just great because there was an oriental family\nwith us and uhm you'll be amazed to find there are a lot of Blacks in America\nstill think that there's a lot of I don't know\n\n\nIt's just amazing the amount of prejudice they have against the\nwhites and the whites against them\n\n\nImaginary and real and and as when I told this friend that I made\nit to Indiana about what had happened on the bus he asked me how many\norientals were there\n\n\nAnd I said aside from me there were about five of us\n\n\nReally\n\n\nAt two am in the morning\n\n\nAnd I said ya and you know what was even more surprising\n\n\nThere was this black guy who offered to help the uhm well he was\nseated at the back and so one of the kids fell asleep you see\n\n\nThe mum wanted to move him up\n\n\nHe just picked up the kid and put him down you know it's like and\nhe helped me put my bag up and everything and and so he said you know things\nare really changing now\n\n\nI said oh really\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nIt it's just it's like the kind of stuff you read in books\n\n\nOnly thing that it's becoming real you know\n\n\nYou see it there\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nOh of course you're reading books from them\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I know\n\n<$C> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd and when I was in Chicago I went to universities a lot\n\n\nThere was a students' discussion I took part in but actually it was\nmore an informal thing\n\n\nWas at Jimmy's the students' bar\n\n\nI went there\n\n\nI was the only oriental there\n\n\nThe entire group ostracized me okay\n\n<$B> \n\nTsk habis man\n\n\nOh my God\n\n\nReally\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nThey didn't even speak to me\n\n\nThey looked at me of course and then <unclear> word </unclear> me\nback with uhm you know that kind of thing and I was like okay I'll just sit\nand I'll listen to what you're saying\n\n\nOh really\n\n\nAfter a while nobody was talking to me anymore\n\n\nIn fact nobody began to\n\n\nThere was some newcomer with me as well but she was uhm she looked\nmore like them\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nSo after a while I just got up and I said to my friend look I\nthink I want to leave now and he was white\n\n\nThen I went up I said what the hell was going on back there\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uh\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd for the next hour and a half there was a white-bashing\nsession\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThey're sick\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah and I was really amazed\n\n\nThese were masters students\n\n\nVery talented brilliant people who have travelled a lot very\nwidely\n\n<$C> \n\nOh they must be from\n\n<$B> \n\nOh obviously they are not brilliant enough\n\n<$C> \n\nThey must be from no they must be from the upper classes\n\n<$A> \n\nProbably\n\n<$C> \n\nUpper middles lah anyway\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$C> \n\nBrought up in a kind of environment which is only white you\nknow\n\n<$A> \n\nBut you'd be finding the prejudice coming from the lower\nclasses as well\n\n\nThey come from all classes\n\n\nThen even upper upper middle people they can be very nice people\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nI mean they had a lot of comments about my English and\n\n<$C> \n\nOh you speak very good English\n\n<$B> \n\nOh they are always amazed but then I guess someone told me\n\n\nI I felt it was quite patronizing\n\n<$A> \n\nYes it was\n\n<$B> \n\nBut then someone told me wouldn't you react the same way if\nyou see a white speaking Chinese\n\n<$C> \n\nYa that's true\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd I thought ya\n\n<$C> \n\nBut it's just very funny when they speak to you slowly\n\n<$A> \n\nOh ya\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd they have a look in the eye like saying are you getting\nwhat I'm saying\n\n\nAre you getting what I'm saying\n\n\nIt's very funny\n\n<$A> \n\nOh ya\n\n\nI had an experience here in Singapore\n\n\nIt's about there's this Australian chap first time in the Orient\n\n\nI hate the word Orient\n\n\nIt's like\n\n<$C> \n\nSomething you described <unclear> word </unclear> first right\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$C> \n\nUh that's right\n\n<$B> \n\nLike Victorian times they call this place suh\n\n<$A> \n\nYa really ancient you know like we're totally\n\n<$C> \n\nIt's like it's like it's like we're still wearing Manchu\nclothes\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd wearing trees <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nYou know when I called the operator\n\n\nOne which state in Singapore\n\n\nNumber two okay do they speak English back there\n\n\nI mean it was like ah God\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's amazing how uhm we know so much about them and how\nlittle they know about us you see\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's cultural domination you know\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd they think it's not important because we're just one\nlittle island back in the east\n\n<$B> \n\nThey don't even know we're an island\n\n\nThey don't know\n\n<$C> \n\nThey don't even know\n\n<$B> \n\nNot many people down there over there\n\n<$A> \n\nUh\n\n<$B> \n\nKnow what Singapore where Singapore is\n\n<$A> \n\nOh ya I know\n\n\nEvery time I say where Singapore is I usually appendage it with\none degree from the equator\n\n\nNot in China\n\n\nMiles from it and and then I confuse them with the Straits Chinese\ndescription\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd and I had these people\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's really quite amazing and and and it's like but the poor\npeople at night <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nI mean some of them I was called the fucking hit in uhm in those\nisland\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I guess it's all part of the LA island experience\n\n\nI got up the boat\n\n\nI was on my way down and that this carrot-coloured punk\n\n<$C> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uh\n\n<$A> \n\nJust started muttering\n\n\nHey hey\n\n\nFucking hit\n\n<$C> \n\nFascist racist you know\n\n<$B> \n\nYa man\n\n<$A> \n\nProbably\n\n\nGot style on his cheek\n\n\nBut that was the only experience I had with racism\n\n\nThat's why from the Harvard experience which you probably know of\n\n\nDid I tell you about that\n\n<$C> \n\nYa what\n\n<$A> \n\nThe Harvard experience\n\n<$C> \n\nWho was that\n\n<$A> \n\nIn Boston\n\n\nI didn't tell you about that\n\n\nIt was probably Vivienne I told then\n\n\nIt was really quite bizarre\n\n\nI want to take a picture of the reading room and compare it with\nthe situation here\n\n<$C> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThen\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd apparently\n\n<$C> \n\nOh ya ya\n\n<$A> \n\nI've taken a picture of this old man who was sitting there\nand studying\n\n<$B> \n\nYou should have asked permission\n\n<$A> \n\nUh well actually I didn't intend to take a picture of him\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nHe was just part of the background foreground actually\n\n\nSo what happened was uh five minutes later he charged down the\nstairways and grabbed the camera just out of my hand like that\n\n\nI was just talking to my friend I was holding the camera\n\n\nHe just pulled it out and all that what the hell\n\n\nAnd he then he started to fiddle with it and everything\n\n<$B> \n\nMy God he's sick\n\n\nHe didn't even explain or anything\n\n<$A> \n\nand I said we shouldn't have taken a picture\n\n\nWe shouldn't have taken a picture and I was thinking of uhm T S\nElliot's <unclear> word </unclear> woman\n\n\nAnd he was like he started fiddling but it was a manual thing so\nhe couldn't fiddle anything with it\n\n\nSo friends of mine were there and they grabbed hold of him and\nthen a tussle followed\n\n\nThen the police were brought in and then then you know removed the\nrascal and\n\n<$B> \n\nOh God\n\n\nHey boy was it\n\n<$A> \n\nManagement came and then are you okay\n\n\nWere you alright\n\n\nAnd then uhm of course as his parting shot uhm he looked at all\nfour us two South Africans one Dutch and one Oriental\n\n\nHe said get the hell back wherever you came from and if you\npublished any of that I'll I'll make sure you're sorry for it or something\n\n\nYeah\n\n\nBut it was great I mean he was he was kind of a good-looking man\ntoo\n\n\nI mean it's like you know he's very well-trimmed white beard and\nwearing beige-coloured shirt\n\n\nBizarre\n\n\nNow how am I going to incorporate all of that into a story\n\n<$B> \n\nYou try\n\n<$C> \n\nYou try ya\n\n\nSmart girl like you\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uh do I detect words <unclear> word </unclear> of\ncondescend\n\n<$B> \n\nDon't disappoint us\n\n<$C> \n\nNaw\n\n<$B> \n\nNaw lah\n\n<$C> \n\nWell\n\n<$B> \n\nShould I be\n\n<$C> \n\nI believe in letting people have the freedom to do to write\nwhat they want to write\n\n<$A> \n\nOh yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$C> \n\nSo I I try not to circumscribe lah otherwise it'll be too\nmuch\n\n<$B> \n\nI'm going to write something too\n\n\nDon't know how to write as I know so much\n\n<$C> \n\nI think

I was quite happy after the first interview but\nwhen they offered me I mean just unofficially\n\n\nThey asked me to go down for meeting to discuss the my my no my\nperiod of notice and other

see\nbut they say they'll think about it\n\n\nThen yesterday they call me and tell me they will give me\n\n\nSo I said oh oh\n\n\nBut the problem was we did we you see they talk so much you know\nso much so that when I wanted to ask them certain things uh I didn't have a\nchance and then I forgot\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nYa so you know things like how many months' notice I must\ngive how many

to\n\n\nAnd they asked me to go down for interview on Monday\n\n\nSo initially I I saw like I was I was not sure whether I wanted to\noops oh dear\n\n\nSo I just took a number I told them I'll call

counter features of our clients' fabric design\n\n<$A> \n\nKind of difficult right\n\n\nOn what basis\n\n<$B> \n\nCopyright uh\n\n<$A> \n\nCopyright infringement\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nI mean I've seen the two design uh the colours are very similar\n\n\nBut the designs I see uh not exactly alike <unclear> word\n</unclear> substantially alike\n\n<$A> \n\nSo <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nI mean one look from far uh looks like the same material\n\n\nBut when you examine it closely and you're looking for differences\nyou can find\n\n<$A> \n\nIf you're not\n\n<$B> \n\nIf you're not one cursory glance if you're really observant\n\n<$A> \n\nWon't make a difference still\n\n<$B> \n\nThen you you will be able to\n\n\nYou even if you are 'cause if even if you're very observant cursory\nglance you may not find it\n\n<$A> \n\nReally\n\n<$B> \n\nYa but you have to look for the difference\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nProbably you can\n\n<$A> \n\nBut it but it happened to my client once you know\n\n\nWhere they called me up and started screaming saying that one of\nthe departmental stores were actually selling uh the fabric uh\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uh\n\n<$A> \n\nUh that was similar to theirs and the reason why they were so\nuptight was because uh it was their summer collection\n\n\nIt was they were going to launch it and was already found in\nanother departmental store\n\n\nUh so you know they actually went to buy up\n\n<$B> \n\nActually went to buy up every\n\n<$A> \n\nThey actually went to I mean they went to that departmental\nstore and bought up the stocks\n\n\nAnd then of course subsequently they spoke to the 'cause they were\ngoing to launch that design\n\n\nSo it would really spoil the market apparently\n\n\nAnd but I compared the thing I couldn't tell the difference\n\n\nI brought it home you know and my mother could tell the difference\n\n\nShe said texture-wise is different style print\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy didn't you go for your warrant of seizure and or search\nand and\n\n<$A> \n\nNo\n\n\nThe problem is that\n\n\nLook uhm this one may not even beat the counterfeit because the\nfabric may come from the same source\n\n\nSo it's there is no copyright infringement\n\n<$B> \n\nRight\n\n<$A> \n\nIt is the same garment\n\n\nSame quality\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's a breach of contract\n\n<$A> \n\nSo it's a breach of contract which doesn't warrant a seizure\nyou see\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uh no no hey am I <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n\n\n<$C> \n\nYou mean there are flats above Saint Michael's\n\n<$D> \n\nYeah\n\n\nIt's a nice little flat two

visiting visiting professors or people on exchange\n\n<$C> \n\nOr in College Green\n\n\nWhat about College Green\n\n<$E> \n\nThose are still University housing\n\n<$D> \n\nSo after that when we went

son jogging I see\n\n<$D> \n\nThey don't go jogging together\n\n<$E> \n\nDo they go jogging separately\n\n<$D> \n\nYes Chandran doesn't go so often and Suresh tries to go once\nor twice a week\n\n<$C> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$D> \n\nNow he's got flab around his stomach that won't go away you\nknow\n\n<$C> \n\nSo how was the food anyway in this friend's shop\n\n<$D> \n\nChinese

satay is Malay\n\n<$E> \n\nOh I see\n\n<$D> \n\nHe was there before and he used to sell satay on outside the\nshop and he got chased away a number of times\n\n\nIt seems like illegal so he went away\n\n\nThen after a while he'll come back and try again\n\n\nThe health authority to come down upon him then he would go away\nagain\n\n<$E> \n\nSo now he's got his own stall\n\n<$D> \n\nBut this time there is there used to be a stall in the shop\nselling popiah\n\n\nIt seems the rent went up to three thousand for the stall so that\nman moved away\n\n\nThe satay seller has taken over so he can afford the rent\n\n<$E> \n\nThree thousand\n\n<$D> \n\nThree thousand\n\n<$E> \n\nExpensive just for a stall\n\n<$D> \n\nYeah\n\n<$E> \n\nNot even like a shophouse or something more\n\n<$C>

disposable bowls and plates\n\n\nBut he doesn't have to do any washing what\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd also <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nDepends on how depends on how fussy you are\n\n\nIf it's there's Muslim food it's Muslim food lah where I'm\nconcerned\n\n<$E> \n\nAre you quite strict about that\n\n<$C> \n\nI know Antonia might say\n\n\nI suppose I am\n\n\nI suppose if there's a choice between Muslim and a non-Muslim\n\n\nI wouldn't go for a Muslim but uh in Singapore it's quite\ndifficult to prevent\n\n<$D> \n\nAye how do you make dosai\n\n<$C> \n\nI haven't made dosai for so long\n\n\nIn fact I made a mistake once\n\n\nI was coming from KL I threw away some of my pots and pans and\nthose were the best ones you know\n\n\nThey were the seasoned one you know but they looked so ugly\n\n\nI throw them away and in fact even I miss them because they were\nseasoned and\n\n<$D> \n\nAluminium\n\n<$C> \n\nYa the old type\n\n<$D> \n\nPeople say aluminium is to be avoided\n\n<$C> \n\nThey cause Alzheimer\n\n<$E> \n\nAnd what's that\n\n<$D> \n\nUhm\n\n<$E> \n\nWhat's Alzheimer\n\n<$C> \n\nAlzheimer disease\n\n<$D> \n\nA disease of the brain in which your brain cells are attacked\nor die\n\n<$E> \n\nThen you become\n\n<$D> \n\nTotally confused\n\n\nYou don't recognise your children\n\n<$E> \n\nIt's not the Alzheimer's Alzheimer's I thought alzoner's\nalsaimer's\n\n<$C> \n\nI thought it was Alzheimer's Alzheimer's disease\n\n<$D> \n\nAlzheimer's\n\n\nBut it's spelt A L Z H\n\n<$E> \n\nYa A L Z and then H L is a high but I don't know\n\n\nThat's how I pronounce it\n\n\nI don't know\n\n<$D> \n\nI've never heard it said so I\n\n<$C> \n\nYa I think I have heard it said but I can't remember\n\n\nThey have they have a programme once uhm SBC I think\n\n\nThat they showed

of severity\n\n\nIt could be senile and not forget and not remember people\n\n\nBut you don't do odd things or think that you're son is a thief or\nsomething\n\n<$C> \n\nI think what sometime old people do that you know like they\nthey misplace things and they will accuse everybody around them\n\n<$E> \n\nThat's right\n\n\nIf they can't find they'll say oh somebody has taken it\n\n<$D> \n\nOr they act very irrationally like uh do very strange things\nin the house\n\n<$C> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> medically you know and the doctor\nsort of sacrifice\n\n<$D> \n\nThey can be mistaken for to be mad because of the weird\nthings they do\n\n<$C> \n\nGot tied up you know <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$E> \n\nThat's why a lot of people want their old folks at home\n\n\nDon't want them to run around then forget their address and unable\nto get back home\n\n<$D> \n\nIt's not really so cruel as people think\n\n\nWe'll have no idea what we'll be like that when we get old\n\n<$E>

time\n\n<$E> \n\nNo this I have two in the States who comes over once uhm\nabout two years but this one is born in Singapore\n\n<$D> \n\nThe same sister\n\n<$E> \n\nNo it's different sister and she

{"text": "<$A> \n\nUh which holiday are you talking about\n\n<$B> \n\nTalking about our next year holiday hor\n\n<$A> \n\nI thought we agree we go to Canada\n\n\nSo that Canada is definite right\n\n<$B> \n\nSomething like that lah\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat do you mean something like that\n\n\nCanada is definite\n\n\nOtherwise I don't want to go anywhere\n\n<$B> \n\nI thought we're going Europe\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm Canada and Europe\n\n\nCan can we combine together the two\n\n<$B> \n\nIt'll be pretty expensive uh so we have to plan it properly\n\n\nOtherwise the cost will be very high\n\n<$A> \n\nBut some of my friends said that it's not possible\n\n\nThey say that you'll take too long and that it's uhm it's going to\nbe a very expensive\n\n\nLike you said it's going to be very expensive\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nThen they say that uhm\n\n\nCan we get to see uhm very much of the two countries if we do it\nthis way you know hopping from Canada to Europe\n\n\nWhat do you think\n\n<$B> \n\nNo we can have a short stay in Canada first\n\n\nWe don't have to visit the whole of Canada\n\n\nJust visit few important cities that are interesting\n\n<$A> \n\nBut I thought Canada is so big and uh I\n\n<$B> \n\nYa but we don't have to go everywhere\n\n\nFor example okay just go Toronto to see the largest city in Canada\n\n\nThen we can take a bus and travel across the Canadian provinces\nfrom Ontario to Manitova to uh British Columbia then go Vancouver\n\n\nFrom there we'll hop into the plane and then proceed to Europe\n\n<$A> \n\nThat means we're going to hop you're going to hop onto a plane\nat Vancouver\n\n<$B> \n\nYa we can stay in Canada for about a week or a week and a half\n\n<$A> \n\nCan we see\n\n\nCan we still see so many things\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nIn a week\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nBut uhm what about the the wild life\n\n\nThat's what I want to see\n\n\nI want to see Can the Canadian uhm the Canadian countryside the\nIndian villages and you know\n\n\nAll those all those famous lakes and uhm\n\n\nWhat do you call those uh uhm uhm reserves the natural reserves\nnature reserves\n\n\nSorry\n\n<$B> \n\nOf course\n\n\nDepends on what you want to see where you want to go you see\n\n\nOne and half week should be more than enough because in Toronto\nwe'll just stay for two days\n\n\nAll right from Toronto we travel to Manitova\n\n\nThat'll take about two and a half days in between the bus\n\n<$A> \n\nBus journey uh\n\n<$B> \n\nRoads\n\n\nYa bus journey we can uh to stop by way along the way from Toronto\nto Manitova to see countryside where the prairies are\n\n\nThen if you want to go and see that Indian villages at Vancouver\n\n\nRemember the book did I will call my name\n\n<$A> \n\nWas it was it Vancouver\n\n\nWas it was\n\n<$B> \n\nYa ya\n\n<$A> \n\nSet in Vancouver\n\n<$B> \n\nThat was in Vancouver\n\n\nThat's where the book I will call my name is set\n\n\nThat'll take another three days\n\n\nSo it's about seven and a half days\n\n\nOnly seven and a half days\n\n\nAdd another two more days for travelling from Manitova to Vancouver\n\n\nSo it'll be just nice\n\n\nOf course it'll be a little bit a little bit rush a little bit\nhectic uh but I think we can manage it\n\n<$A> \n\nSo you already have a rough itinerary planned is it\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nDarling\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> half week\n\n\nIf not we can we can actually just drop in at Vancouver and forget\nabout Toronto\n\n<$A> \n\nNo I want to see as much of Canada as possible and I also want\nto go to Lake <unclear> word </unclear> University\n\n\nCos I want to see I want to see your university\n\n\nI want to see how small it is and and how obscure it is\n\n<$B> \n\nShut up\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy you you insulted uh I insulted your university uhm\n\n\nBut seriously I want to see where you spend that three years of\nyour life pursuing your degree and and also uhm want to see who are these\nprofessors who talk about who seem to think so highly of you\n\n\nI want to find out whether is it true that they really think so\nhighly of you\n\n<$B> \n\nAnyway we can always take a plane from Toronto to Vancouver or\ntake a plane from Lake <unclear> word </unclear> to Vancouver\n\n\nThat will cut down the journey from one and a half weeks to one\nweek maybe\n\n<$A> \n\nBut doesn't it mean\n\n<$B> \n\nThen we spend another three more weeks in Europe\n\n<$A> \n\nNo but isn't taking planes even inter-city planes isn't it uhm\nmore expensive than taking the bus\n\n\nThe greyhound is it\n\n\nIs it the greyhound\n\n\nThey have greyhounds\n\n<$B> \n\nOf course\n\n<$A> \n\nIn Canada\n\n<$B> \n\nOf course\n\n<$A> \n\nI thought greyhound's only used in the United States\n\n<$B> \n\nNo it's trans-North America\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n\nSo if we take the plane we we will have to pay more right\n\n\nIs it very much more\n\n<$B> \n\nFrom where\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't know\n\n\nYou just said that from one from Vancouver to Toronto and then or\nfrom Lake <unclear> word </unclear> upwards\n\n<$B> \n\nOf course uh\n\n\nFrom Toronto to Vancouver cost us about four hundred Canadian\ndollars\n\n<$A> \n\nAir ticket uh\n\n<$B> \n\nYa one way from\n\n<$A> \n\nThen what about if we take the greyhound bus\n\n<$B> \n\nGreyhound is about two hundred over Canadian\n\n\nBut they are valid for thirty days\n\n<$A> \n\nOh so if so I guess that we'll be doing most of our\ntravelling by the greyhound right unless we're really\n\n<$B> \n\nYes <unclear> word </unclear> if we are if we planned to see\nthe countryside\n\n<$A> \n\nThen we have to take the bus\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm good\n\n\nI can't wait for this holiday so I've been thinking and thinking\n\n<$B> \n\nDon't think too much\n\n\nPlan for it\n\n<$A> \n\nI can't wait for our second honeymoon and and and really\nthink I deserve a holiday\n\n\nAfter all this June holidays I hardly in fact we didn't go\nanywhere out of Singapore\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay okay\n\n\nSo one and a half week in Canada Canada\n\n\nWhere what else\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm see\n\n\nI also want to go to some of the places you have some of the\nplaces where you you have skid\n\n\nUh to see you in action since you claim that you are such a\nwonderful skier\n\n\nI I want to see you go down the slopes and you know\n\n\nSee how wonderful\n\n<$B> \n\nTumble down right\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no I didn't say tumble down\n\n\nYou don't\n\n<$B> \n\nSnowing down right\n\n<$A> \n\nUh\n\n<$B> \n\nRolling down\n\n<$A> \n\nSnowballing down maybe\n\n<$B> \n\nSo horrible\n\n<$A> \n\nNo\n\n\nI really want to see\n\n\nI I only see you skate\n\n<$B> \n\nAny any anyway where which Europe country are we going\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy you so keen to change the conversation\n\n\nI'm still interested in Canada for your information\n\n<$B> \n\nToo short\n\n\nToo short a day too short the days to to discuss too detailed\nabout what to\n\n\nUnless you want to spend more than two weeks but that's our not\nthe original plan\n\n\nSo I think we sh\n\n<$A> \n\nI I don't think we have even discussed the original plan\n\n<$B> \n\nI think you better discuss some which country you want to\nvisit which countries which which which you want to visit in Europe\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n\nDo we do\n\n\nOuch\n\n\nStop pinching me\n\n\nDo we want to go to Europe or just or just England\n\n<$B> \n\nI thought you want to visit most most of Europe\n\n\nThen how come now England only\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't think we can\n\n\nI mean we I I think we really got to plan uh our European tour\nvery carefully\n\n\nBecause I don't think we're going to get to see very much of one\ncountry if we intend to hop you know\n\n\nIf we intend to cover as many countries as possible in Europe\n\n\nIn fact uhm I think if we if we decide to go Europe we might as\nwell give up England you know\n\n\nBecause England by itself by itself has got so much to offer I\nmean in terms of sight\n\n\nAnd I mean tour tourist sights and historical I mean hist\nhistorical sights as well\n\n\nSo some of my friends have told me that actually you can spend\nmaybe a whole month in England\n\n\nSo I think maybe we either go England and spend the three weeks\nthere or we we we go just Europe backpacking in Europe\n\n\nAnd if we do backpacking in Europe I think we should uhm visit\nplaces like uhm okay definitely France uhm Holland Holland mainly because I\nwant to see the tulip the tulips and the uhm what uh\n\n\nThe tulips the windmills and cer and and a little bit of the\nredlight district to find out whether it's really really red\n\n<$B> \n\nSo that's definitely Europe tour\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd I have said uhm I don't mind spending the whole\n\n<$B> \n\nIn that case got to see a lot more and cut down the number of\ndays in Canada\n\n<$A> \n\nNo but I want\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause anyway you cannot spend too much time and too much\nmoney on one trip\n\n<$A> \n\nBut I uhm actually uh I'd rather concentrate more on Canada\n\n\nI know you you have spent three years you have spent three years\nthere darling so that therefore therefore you therefore you want to go Europe\nwhereas for me I haven't seen Canada right and neither have I seen Europe\n\n\nBut I'm more interested in Canada because because that's kind of a\nsecond home to you so it's for your sake\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's okay for the first trip we just go Canada and England\nand that's it\n\n<$A> \n\nCanada and England\n\n<$B> \n\nThen for the Europe trip we should make it on a second round\nwhere where we'll visit the real Europe\n\n<$A> \n\nBut will we be able to have another backpacking trip\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy not\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause by that time what happens if we if\n\n<$B> \n\nBuy some Four-Ds\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat happen what happen if if if I get pregnant\n\n\nAnd then how am I going to backpack with with a child inside me\n\n<$B> \n\nYou front pack\n\n<$A> \n\nDon't talk nonsense\n\n\nFront pack\n\n\nBut uh I don't know\n\n\nYou sound really keen to go to Europe\n\n\nYou really want to go Europe uh\n\n<$B> \n\nWhoa you don't have to be so nice <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nOkay so so countryside\n\n<$A> \n\nYou mean you don't mind not going back to Canada next year uh\n\n<$B> \n\nOf course not\n\n\nOf course I'd like to visit to if I can make it a chance see visit\ninstead of backpacking visit\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm why\n\n\nI want to backpack\n\n<$B> \n\nOr we just visit one or two cities\n\n<$A> \n\nSo few uh\n\n<$B> \n\nAll I can say make it into two trips\n\n\nFirst trip two countries\n\n\nThree four years later another trip\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nMaybe by then they have invented space shuttle around the\nworld\n\n<$A> \n\nSpace shuttle round the world\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nWho would who will invent it\n\n\nYou right\n\n<$B> \n\nOf course\n\n<$A> \n\nAiyah still can't decide whether to go just Canada and\nEngland or or a little bit of each\n\n\nI think\n\n<$B> \n\nAnyway don't forget you also have to save for the renovation\nof the house\n\n<$A> \n\nSo that what does that mean\n\n\nWe still got to decide right\n\n<$B> \n\nNo one piece of <unclear> word </unclear> you cannot cut into\ntoo many pieces\n\n\nIt'll cut you right\n\n<$A> \n\nSo what are you trying to say Philosopher\n\n\nYep please please go on and explain your your your wise saying\n\n<$B> \n\nSo it's either we have more money for one trip more places\nbut less stays per places or multiple trips longer days per places and wait\nlonger in in between the trips\n\n<$A> \n\nOr what we can do is we can still go Canada one and a half\nweeks and then maybe select certain cities in Europe\n\n\nThat means we don't get to cover all of Europe right or like you\nsaid we just go Canada and England\n\n\nWhat do you think about that\n\n<$B> \n\nEngland is part to Europe\n\n<$A> \n\nNo England is separate by itself\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's now part of EEC\n\n\nThey have a common dollar now\n\n<$A> \n\nSo okay lah since you want to be so so so\n\n<$B> \n\nThere's a tube now\n\n<$A> \n\nYou want to be\n\n<$B> \n\nFrom England to to French\n\n<$A> \n\nEngland to France uh\n\n<$B> \n\nNaw to French because it's French Fries\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm don't talk nonsense\n\n\nWe're taped so I guess really have to discuss this a little\nfurther right \n\n\nBut have no time to talk about the car already so I think uhm ya\nwe'll discuss the other issues another day right", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a03c8724-4349-423c-8664-5294d5f1ae45",

<unclear> word </unclear> can you come to the phone\nfor a while\n\n<$B> \n\nUh just a minute uh\n\n\nIs it urgent or not\n\n<$C> \n\nUrgent yes\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n\nWere you around at the Peter Lewis seminar\n\n<$A> \n\nNo\n\n\nI was yesterday\n\n\nI missed service Sunday service uh\n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nHow was the seminar\n\n<$B> \n\nI I think for the night meetings uh about two hundred plus\n\n<$A> \n\nTwo hundred plus uh\n\n<$B> \n\nTwo hundred twenty thirty\n\n\nI expected more uh\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nBut\n\n<$A> \n\nWere these people church members or outside\n\n<$B> \n\nMost of them were church members\n\n\nBut I I I I'm beginning to see uhm maybe we we need to we need to\nwe need to strategize the publicity\n\n\nRemember two two two years ago your missions conference was goyak\n\n<$A> \n\nNo\n\n\nMission conference was okay\n\n<$B> \n\nTwo years ago\n\n\nRemember when uh Terence was organising it\n\n<$A> \n\nOh when I was still a student\n\n<$B> \n\nAttendance\n\n<$A> \n\nPut the record straight\n\n\nI was a student not working yet\n\n<$B> \n\nThe attendance was terrible\n\n\nRemember only about a few people turned up\n\n\nAnd that unless unless you push hard uh people will not come\n\n\nUh uh we were just talking about it last night with uh Danny and\nuh my wife and Philip\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's it's information overkill\n\n\nThey look up the bulletin on Sunday\n\n<$A> \n\nThere're too many\n\n<$B> \n\nToo many things\n\n<$A> \n\nToo many\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's information overload\n\n\nThe system breakdown\n\n\nThey don't know how to prioritize\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nWhich one to attend which one not to attend\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSo in the end they glaze over everything and nothing seems in\n\n<$A> \n\nThat's probably just one one factor\n\n\nI think the other point you need to see is the period in which you\nbegan your publicity\n\n<$B> \n\nLong time ago you know\n\n<$A> \n\nLong time\n\n\nWhen when when was long time ago\n\n<$B> \n\nI wrote a letter to all the the Small Group Leaders you know\n\n\nAbout one and a half months ago\n\n<$A> \n\nBut you you didn't have prayer meeting calling the Small\nGroup Leaders to pray\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nWhich we did\n\n\nOur mission conference preparation took about a year\n\n\nIt's just the preparation and then we have our quarterly uh\nmission prayer night\n\n\nAnd we made it a point to emphasize to point out this mission\nconference\n\n<$B> \n\nI suppose the other the other thing is how you sell how you\nsell the publicity\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nPut the topic like that\n\n\nYou'll deter a lot of people from coming\n\n<$A> \n\nYa ya\n\n<$B> \n\nOnly those who are really interested come\n\n<$A> \n\nThe the the topic itself tells you what is expected uh\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nSpiritual movement\n\n\nNot everybody wants <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nNot everybody wants discipleship too\n\n\nIt's it scares people away the topic\n\n<$A> \n\nYa discipleship <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nYou can <unclear> word </unclear> with missions what\n\n\nWhen you organize a missions conference people interested in\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nThose not interested won't come\n\n\nSo in the but I I think on the whole those who came really\nbenefited\n\n<$A> \n\nThey were Small Group Leaders\n\n<$B> \n\nMost of them\n\n\nBut I there were a lot more Small Group Leaders who didn't turn up\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSomehow they <unclear> word </unclear> that's good\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I I think uh uh he's a good fellow to fall back for\nsomething <unclear> word </unclear> conference uh\n\n\nTalking about a Bible conference Sunday School <unclear> word\n</unclear> seminar or something of that sort\n\n\n'Cos his exposition is quite good\n\n\nThat's supposed to be his specialty\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat's his background\n\n<$B> \n\nBaptist\n\n<$A> \n\nEvangelical Baptist\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n\nBut he preached at uh he was a good friend of Martin Lloyd Jones\n\n<$A> \n\nReally\n\n<$B> \n\nMartin Lloyd Jones got him to preach <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nSo did\n\n\nOh really so uh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo his style of preaching is Martin Lloyd Jones'\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nYou read Martin Lloyd Jones books and listen to his tapes and\nuh the style is about the same\n\n\nBut I when I was sitting down talking to him I I think right now\nhe might be coming back here quite often because he's made contacts with uh\nChurch of Singapore\n\n\nHe's made contacts with uh Anglican church\n\n<$A> \n\nOh is it\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd I think his own church in UK is finally releasing him\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nTo go on this kind of tours\n\n\nSo if you want to you can call him again\n\n<$A> \n\nMaybe family camp will be good\n\n\nIf they talk about Wesley Wesley camp pointing or focused on\nactivities\n\n\nThis time perhaps focus on Bible study <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nIf we have if we have a Bible conference <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n\nBut uh I think next year will be a different conference inviting\nsomebody else\n\n\nWhole flavour will change\n\n<$A> \n\nMaybe we just have too many conferences\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's another possibility lah\n\n\nWe have we have too many programs in town\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uh\n\n<$B> \n\nPeople have to choose\n\n\nSo it's overload overkill\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nUh don't know lah\n\n\nI hope I I'm I'm glad that I have finished this project\n\n<$A> \n\nSo this one of your projects\n\n<$B> \n\nFor this year\n\n\nSo now I'm looking forward to moving house again\n\n<$A> \n\nUh that that

seldom do over there \n\n<$A> \n\nUh\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause for them to to eat out it's <unclear> word\n</unclear> ten times more than cooking at home\n\n\nSo for them after church uh it's

today will be a different\none\n\n\nDon't say always leh\n\n\nhasn't happen yet\n\n<$B> \n\nI'm sure\n\n<$A> \n\nNo because of you\n\n\nYou are here that's why\n\n<$B> \n\nBut the whole world is in

good\n\n\nWe were talking about Felicity right\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nYa it was such a letdown towards the end\n\n\nOf course they won't want to tell us who she went off with\n\n<$B> \n\nYa you know these Hollywood they want to you know bring it to\na climax to a point where you need to watch the next season to find out\n\n\nLike Friends right\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nEvery season they end with Ross and Rachel going to come\ntogether\n\n\nBut you don't know whether they come together\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat they call a cliffhanger\n\n<$B> \n\nYa they always do that\n\n<$A> \n\nSo\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I found one thing very interesting\n\n\nDon't know whether whether you noticed when you were watching\n\n\nThroughout the whole the whole the whole whole show the show uses a\npiece of music classical music\n\n<$A> \n\nOh yes\n\n\nThat's the one you lent me\n\n\nWhat is it called\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's called Bolero by Ravel\n\n<$A> \n\nYa that's right I remember\n\n\nIt starts with one instrument and then it goes on to have more and\nmore instruments\n\n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's right\n\n\nAnd everything reaches a climax to the end\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nSo it's interesting that they use this music\n\n\nAnd you find the music each sequence getting louder and louder\n\n\nYou know you are going to reach a climax\n\n\nBut the sad thing is that the climax is the next season\n\n<$A> \n\nBut half way through the they changed music\n\n\nIt's no longer that Ravel music\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nYa they changed it half way through\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I have not finished watching it\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's quite good uh the suspense\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nThe way they build up\n\n\nI think it's coming true\n\n\nPeople are coming in\n\n<$B> \n\nYa you see\n\n<$A> \n\nThey are at Cool Station\n\n<$B> \n\nI told you it will happen\n\n\nBut like I said one more time\n\n\nThe world the world is in front of me\n\n<$A> \n\nThank you\n\n\nYou were saying you like Mad About You the recent episode\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nThat was nice right\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's nice\n\n\nIt was very heartwarming I would say\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know my tears just rolled down when at the moment when\nthey broke off and you wonder why for all the small reasons I mean he when\nthey break up all the couples in the world would have broken up so many times\nover again\n\n<$A> \n\nI like the way it's told\n\n\nYou have the daughter you know narrating and then it flashes back\nto how they were trying to come together\n\n<$B> \n\nCute and the daughter it's cute uh\n\n<$A> \n\nYa quite cute\n\n<$B> \n\nVery cute the way she talks\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat's the girl's name again uh\n\n<$B> \n\nMabel\n\n<$A> \n\nHelen Hunt\n\n\nNo her screen name\n\n\nSo it's Paul and Jamie Bucman\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nI saw that part where they were at the altar and Jamie asked\nherself\n\n\nShe said no I cannot do this and then she left the altar\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nI saw that part too\n\n<$A> \n\nSaw that part uh\n\n\nBut why\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy why do you think\n\n\nI mean you you are a lady what intuitive thing can you think of\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't know maybe she thought that after all they have been\ntogether for so long they brought up this girl so what so why is there a need\nto come together\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nI was thinking also maybe maybe maybe she is just sentimental of\nold things\n\n\nSo to do something new again maybe she scared that may change\ncertain things or something like that\n\n\nMaybe she didn't want to do it\n\n\nWhat's the point of doing it\n\n\nMaybe she just needed Paul to say yes I will marry you and to say\nI do first\n\n\nThat's all she needed\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nMaybe that's all she need\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I just find it sad they broke off for those reasons\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat are those reasons\n\n\nI can't quite recall\n\n<$B> \n\nPaul said that he couldn't stand her criticisms anymore to a\npoint where she always he always feels that she is always right and he has to\nbe the wrong one all the time\n\n\nAnd he left because he couldn't couldn't stand it\n\n<$A> \n\nHow did did they came back together\n\n\nRight that's why it's so heartwarming\n\n<$B> \n\nYes ya ya\n\n<$A> \n\nLet's refresh how did they come back together again\n\n<$B> \n\nThey went to the premiere of their daughter's movie\n\n\nThe daughter their daughter made a movie\n\n\nSort of a sort of about their lives\n\n<$A> \n\nSo it is a movie that makes them come back together\n\n<$B> \n\nI think is much more than that\n\n\nBut I think that's the catalyst ya\n\n\nBut all along I think even when they are off each other they still\nlove each other a lot\n\n<$A> \n\nYa that's nice\n\n\nI love the screen chemistry the chemistry between them Paul and\nJamie\n\n\nIt's really good\n\n<$B> \n\nIncidentally she is nominated again this year for the Emmy\naward for best actress\n\n\nShe won two years running already\n\n<$A> \n\nShe just got married isn't it\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nYou know to who\n\n<$A> \n\nHelen Hunt ya\n\n\nAzaria\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nThe guy is in Mad About You the dog trainer\n\n<$A> \n\nThe dog trainer\n\n<$B> \n\nyou know the

hours\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nI mean kind of silly\n\n\nFunny in a sense\n\n\nThen Rachel came back with that cat that looks like a monster\n\n<$A> \n\nYa and Joey kept saying that's not a cat\n\n\nThat was quite cute\n\n\nThat was quite cute\n\n\nSo it was about the cat that doesn't look like a cat on a red\npillow red cushion\n\n<$B> \n\nWhen you you watched Austin Powers\n\n<$A> \n\nOh yes\n\n<$B> \n\nThe cat looks exactly like that Austin Powers cat\n\n\nThe evil\n\n<$A> \n\nOh the evil\n\n<$B> \n\nDoctor Evil\n\n<$A> \n\nDoctor Evil's cat\n\n\nYa I didn't notice that\n\n\nAnd she tried to sell it off\n\n\nShe bought it for one thousand dollars\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd she sold it at a profit\n\n<$A> \n\nShe sold it for\n\n<$B> \n\nThousand five\n\n<$A> \n\nThousand five\n\n\nNot bad uh\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause the guy had a had a crush on her\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n\nSo wanted to please her\n\n\nTonight Ally McBeal\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nDo you think it would be a good season this time\n\n<$B> \n\nIs is actually a repeat\n\n<$A> \n\nRepeat of what\n\n<$B> \n\nOf all the interesting episodes of the two seasons\n\n\nSo TCS just take out the interesting bits from all\n\n\nThey chose fourteen episodes\n\n<$A> \n\nBut they say it's the first of the\n\n<$B> \n\nthe first season\n\n<$A> \n\nThe first season\n\n\nOh I see\n\n\nOh ya this this movie called A Man Called Hero\n\n\nThey said it's terrible\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat kind of terrible things you hear\n\n<$A> \n\nOh like what you told me the other day\n\n\nHow come he can just jump and reach the moon so incredible\n\n\nAnd uh actually for Chinese movies we want to look for good sword\nfights and kung fu and things like that you know\n\n\nBut even my Malay students they said that it's terrible\n\n<$B> \n\nMalay students\n\n<$A> \n\nMalay students\n\n\nWhat do you think\n\n<$B> \n\nI think well it is the same team who did the Stormriders\n\n\nAnd the guy said he wanted to do it better\n\n\nSo I think he I think I misunderstand the word better\n\n<$A> \n\nBetter means reach the moon\n\n<$B> \n\nYa ya ya\n\n\nSo you must jump higher you know\n\n\nThe kung fu must be more outrageous it's terrible right\n\n\nStill still in the good old days they made a TV serial out of it\n\n\nAnd that one is very good\n\n\nThe series was very long about thirty or forty episodes\n\n\nI remember it was one of the best series around\n\n<$A> \n\nZhong Hua Ying Xiong\n\n<$B> \n\nZhong Hua Ying Xiong\n\n\nIt's not easy for them to condense three hundred copies of comic\nbooks stories into a two hour movie\n\n\nThey have to take out all the best bits of the comic book and put\nit into the movie\n\n\nGuess it's a bit difficult too\n\n<$A> \n\nSounds like you are defending them\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I have not watch it yet\n\n\nBut I think I will probably won't like it\n\n<$A> \n\nWell I think this thing about special effects\n\n\nSometimes it makes it thin in a way you know the plot\n\n\nThe depth of character is not there\n\n\nSo sometimes together with the depth of character and good\ncharacterisation good plot with special effects I think it will make a good\nmovie\n\n<$B> \n\nYa that's right\n\n<$A> \n\nThe actors are quite good right in this case\n\n\nE-kin\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm he fits the persona of A Man Called Hero\n\n\nIf you read the comic books he looks almost exactly you know\nreally like the comic hero\n\n\nHe fits the role\n\n<$A> \n\nBut as a movie is it a good one I mean in terms of uh you\nknow you study films\n\n\nSo in terms of that you think is it a good movie\n\n\nYou haven't watched it yet actually\n\n<$B> \n\nI haven't watched it yet\n\n\nBut I uh read enough I see enough to know a little bit\n\n\nI guess what helps the movie maybe is the chemistry of him\n\n\nHe has the a kind of certain charisma that fits the role\n\n\nThat melancholic person that walks the earth and knows that\nwhatever relationship people forms with him uh won't stand the test of time\n\n\nThat relationship will probably die because he is a curse on earth\n\n\nAnd he fits the persona you know he looks sad all the time\n\n<$A> \n\nSo looks like he has a role to play to to save the world is\nit\n\n\nBut for himself he cannot form meaningful relationships\n\n\nDeep ones\n\n<$B> \n\nYa deep ones\n\n\nThat's why I think in the movie also he has a son\n\n\nAnd uh he refused to acknowledge him\n\n\nAnd the son keep asking him why don't you want to acknowledge me\n\n\nBecause you know he feels that he is superstitious in a way uh\n\n<$A> \n\nIt might interfere with his role as a hero\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nDoes he have a wife\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nYang but she was killed half way through the movie\n\n\nAnd you know these movies sword fighting movies is always about\nrevenge\n\n<$A> \n\nAiyah the lady always dies\n\n\nAnd then the hero will go on\n\n<$B> \n\nNot my story\n\n\nMy story won't happen\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's all right\n\n\nShe's got a role to play\n\n\nShe has got nothing to do so she must die\n\n\nMakes it more sad\n\n<$B> \n\nI mean sword fighting movies are always like that hor\n\n\nThe ladies are just flower pots\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat\n\n<$B> \n\nI mean I'm saying sword fighting movies\n\n\nFlower pots\n\n<$A> \n\nFlower pots\n\n\nUhm I don't like that\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't like that too\n\n<$A> \n\nMake a movie that is different \n\n\nBut there are some where the ladies play a part uh I think there\nwas one Chinese show Chinese movie you lent me where the lady also fights\n\n\nFong Sai Yuk\n\n<$B> \n\nOh yes the mother\n\n\nThat was funny\n\n<$A> \n\nThe mother\n\n\nShe was really good right", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "92a2cf8b-a8e9-48dc-95ea-c98d7c240357", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nI'm shifting to the marketing department\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm uh what's the date that you're going\n\n<$A> \n\nUh Lin Chin has said that um it's with effect from August\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's nice\n\n<$A> \n\nUh actually what's the proper procedure the\n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nSupposed we have <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nI have to speak to Kok Wah because probably he already gave the\nclearance from what I right\n\n<$A> \n\nYa but then uh admin has to\n\n<$B> \n\nYa we have to issue a note to say you are henceforth posted to\nthe new section\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nSo since <unclear> word </unclear> cleared I don't expect too\nmuch problems\n\n\nBut uh who's replacing you\n\n<$A> \n\nUh I think that uh admin's supposed to have\n\n<$B> \n\nRecruit is it\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's why we have to look at this recruitment in about new\nAOs\n\n\nWe've got quite a few applicants but we don't know whether we want\nto you know advertise another round again ya\n\n<$A> \n\nDo we have vacancies\n\n<$B> \n\nYa your vacancy because we've shifted you <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nAll right\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd uh some other vacancy you know\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nAround so uh when Edie comes back lah\n\n\nHe's away until twenty twentieth\n\n\nSo when he comes back we'd probably get his clearance to do\nsomething\n\n\nProbably do another round because at the moment we're doing the\nclerks and the lower paid staff\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSo after that uh after we finish that round of interviews then\nwe'll come back to the <unclear> word </unclear> business again\n\n\nThere're quite a few applicants but I think maybe my <unclear> word\n</unclear> it it depends on him\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nWhen when when to do it you see\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nSo uh so what have you been doing there\n\n\nHave you started work there\n\n<$A> \n\nYa uhm I'm helping out with the <unclear> word </unclear>\ndinner which is August the third\n\n<$B> \n\nAh third ya\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then uh I think Suzanne is giving me uh it's indicated\nthat\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nUh I should do certain projects lah\n\n<$B> \n\nRight\n\n<$A> \n\nUh like just now I was uh creating a file for uh this this\nviolinist from England\n\n<$B> \n\nAh\n\n<$A> \n\nWith his academy\n\n\nHe's going on tour in September ninety three\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd you're going to get sponsors for that group whatever\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nI see\n\n<$A> \n\nQuite a number of staff uh in BM BMW in October\n\n\nThey're going to bring in either a opera or singing\n\n<$B> \n\nOh that's nice\n\n\nIn October this year\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nUh BMW is sponsoring is it\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nJoined with NAC\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nAh that's great\n\n<$A> \n\nWe are presenting\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nSo\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat what's the opera\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't really know if it's an opera actually but\n\n<$B> \n\nOr is a musical\n\n<$A> \n\nYa something like that\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's on the music side is it\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nYa that's fine\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then\n\n<$B> \n\nSo is it Kallang\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> I think that's the biggest venue lah\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I'm sure we're all looking forward to going\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nSo how\n\n\nAfter Festival of Arts not dead yet\n\n<$A> \n\nNo lah immigration almost killed me okay\n\n<$B> \n\nYa but I think that's sorted out quite well and the Indian\ngroup did come\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nThat one that uh I helped you to clear\n\n<$A> \n\nYa but uh I think in the I think the post-mortem helps in the\nsense that uh it prepares the next person\n\n<$B> \n\nNext person\n\n<$A> \n\nWho is\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nGoing to take over you see\n\n<$B> \n\nBut we're probably trying to catch the same person 'cos then\nthe person\n\n<$A> \n\nNo\n\n<$B> \n\nWill know the job better\n\n<$A> \n\nOh no\n\n<$B> \n\nWell if you don't want uh you probably have to do logistics of\nother sorts anyway or worse\n\n\nWait till they present you with ticketing where you have to be like\nConnie and get scolding from the public\n\n<$A> \n\nOh no\n\n<$B> \n\nOh that's worse you know\n\n<$A> \n\nI'm not looking forward to it man\n\n<$B> \n\nYa but that's uh that's one in two years right\n\n\nBut uh\n\n<$A> \n\nI think I had sleepless nights man about this\n\n<$B> \n\nYa I know <unclear> word </unclear> sleepless nights about\nsomething or other\n\n\nSo that's why they are going to give you all a thank you lunch or\ndinner\n\n<$A> \n\nNot me\n\n<$B> \n\nAll of us\n\n\nAll of us\n\n\nAll of us\n\n<$A> \n\nReally\n\n<$B> \n\nEvery single one\n\n\nEither Chairman or Minister will give something I mean a thank you\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nOh this year\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd uh council did say I think it's recorded in my notes\n\n\nOh hi we're like having a taped conversation\n\n\nShe's doing some survey work\n\n\nCould you come in oh okay fine\n\n\nRight\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nFine okay right\n\n\nUh this one has to do with some endowment policy\n\n\nWe've been doing some research work there\n\n<$A> \n\nOh ya\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm so how to invest our money <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I think uh quite good lah now that after a year it's been\na year\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd I'm paying income tax\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nI just brought in my income tax form today\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd uh have you all got any new sponsors in mind\n\n\nDon't name them in the tape though\n\n<$A> \n\nOh ya uh\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nIs this going to be confidential\n\n\nI hope so\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm but we haven't discussed any <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nMy career moves\n\n<$B> \n\nNo but I mean it's like it's already known right\n\n\nBecause uh Kok Wah\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nHas agreed to it and uh you know shouldn't worry about it\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's just that I think it's a very exciting area to go into\nbut\n\n<$A> \n\nI think so\n\n<$B> \n\nYou should also maybe get Suzanne's help or yourself because\nwe don't have the time really\n\n\nIf there are any marketing courses uh or fund-raising\n\n\nFund-raising usually they don't have fund-raising\n\n\nWe usually have to internally organize\n\n\nBut uh I suppose Suzanne can uh give you some advice\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\n'Cos some of the courses that I'm <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nI'm seeing someone on the sixteenth\n\n\nThis fellow is from don't-know-what university\n\n\nUh uh this was before I think what Lester or what Lest what don't\nknow which university in UK\n\n\nNow they they've converted into a university\n\n\nNo that was a polytechnic before\n\n\nNow it's converted to a university\n\n\nLet me see where he's from Grayham Chapman Hai\n\n\nI forgot which university <unclear> word </unclear> gave me the\ncard\n\n\nHe he's coming here and I was seeing whether we can link up\nbecause there're like only two universities that do Arts Admin courses you\nknow\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThis one and of course City University London\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I I think the States\n\n\nPractically every other university has Arts Admin course\n\n<$A> \n\nReally\n\n<$B> \n\nYa they've got a whole manual\n\n<$A> \n\nOh I'm I'm so glad that\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nYou are <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nNo I've had the <unclear> word </unclear> ya but the thing is\nthat we are debating as to whether you really need to uh\n\n\nIf you are already a graduate it's not necessary to do a like\nthree-year Arts Admin course because the Arts Admin course covers a lot of\nareas which you already know\n\n<$A> \n\nThat's true\n\n<$B> \n\nUh marketing if you're Econs graduate Statistics and all that\n\n\nYou probably want to do like Diploma kind you know\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nOr selected credit subjects\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nBut what if we uh are interested in say uh a marketing course\nuh in in Institute of Singapore\n\n<$B> \n\nIf ya uh you see we are quite liberal uh who is this person\n\n\nUh Yong Kian is already enrolled for a PR course you know and we\npaid for it\n\n\nIf you do come across a marketing course which I think SIM and all\nthat has\n\n<$A> \n\nYes yes ya\n\n<$B> \n\nGet a brochure\n\n\nLet us know apply to us we definitely consider because we also get\nSDF funding 'cos that mean we don't need to pay in total\n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n\nOh this is <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nSo even for Yong Kian's one we're getting some SDF funding\nokay\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay but I hear her she's it's a very uh short-term\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nCourse right\n\n\nIt's like uh only about about few months\n\n<$B> \n\nBut she sits for\n\n\nYa ya a few months and then she gets a cert\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nBut you see I think uh yours could be a longer one\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nIt could be a diploma\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nSo we I do not know the detailed arrangements but if say you\nit's relevant to your area of work\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nWe will support if it's not too expensive and you can get SDF\nfunding <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nWe got to look at that aspect\n\n\nAnd then also uh I don't know whether they'll bond people\n\n\nI mean if we pay and\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nWhether we'll bond them but\n\n<$A> \n\nOh I see\n\n<$B> \n\nI mean if if it's only two three thousand I don't think we'll\nbond them\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n\nBut then like Yong Kian was saying that she wanted us to pay her\nmembership fee after she's completed the course\n\n\nBut I think that's not fair lah because after you complete a\ncourse it's already your own personal one whether you want to continue\n\n<$A> \n\nMembership fee\n\n<$B> \n\nYa I think what this Institute of what Public Public Relation\n\n<$A> \n\nOh that that's a different\n\n<$B> \n\nYa ya\n\n\nIt's so ya\n\n<$A> \n\nthing <unclear> word </unclear> altogether uh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo you should look at those SIM courses because I think you\ncan even take exams that are you know marked by accredited uh institutions\nabroad\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSo you do come out with another skill\n\n\nA danger of training you people so well you become so marketable\nyou say goodbye to us at the end of it\n\n<$A> \n\nOh ya\n\n\nBut then no risk no gain\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm well we expect well you you have some commitment uh\n\n<$A> \n\nUh\n\n<$B> \n\nBut you'll probably say you want some career path mapped out\nfor you too\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uh\n\n\nSo you I mean we will well in a way if we were to to train you and\nall it's already part of career development and all that\n\n\nAnd it also would depend on your performance and what they they\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nConsider I mean we have to look at your CEP lah\n\n\nCEP is always moving\n\n\nYou know what is CEP or not\n\n\nCurrent Estimated Potential\n\n<$A> \n\nRising hopefully\n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSo like some people when they come in it's like in\ngovernment's eyes all scholars have very high CEP future Perm Secs\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nThat kind of thing\n\n<$A> \n\nBut uh I think that any investment will will entail some form\nof risk lah\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nSo uh you're investing in your manpower\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm well\n\n<$A> \n\nThere's risk involved\n\n<$B> \n\nWe we have to like say after you finish your course you say\ngoodbye\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm that will quite sad\n\n<$B> \n\nYa but then marketing people are so in demand and the market\noutside pays so well\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know it's a problem keeping people\n\n\nSo maybe I don't know\n\n\nHold on a minute\n\n<$A> \n\nWow so loud\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's myself going for a course\n\n\nI've always nominated people for courses\n\n\nIt's a local course I need to go there\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> Administration\n\n<$B> \n\nUh for a job evaluation\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm two full days and then that's in July end of July and\nthen uh two full days in August\n\n<$A> \n\nSelecting the right people for the right job\n\n<$B> \n\nNo not really\n\n\nJob evaluation is like you know uh you evaluate the worth of the\njob you know\n\n\nThat that's the\n\n\nThen from there then they'll determine the market value of the job\n\n<$A> \n\nAh\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nWe can see the application <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nSo that after you've done that then you can come up with a\nnew salary structure\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n\nWell I mean this has been very fruitful\n\n\nI mean discussing your career prospects and what we are doing uh\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nIs the fifteen minutes up yet\n\n\nOr do we have another\n\n\nAnother okay\n\n\nSo I don't know what else you want to talk about\n\n\nAbout the tailors\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> no no tell tell me about your\ngolfing\n\n\nWhere do you golf and\n\n<$B> \n\nUh Sembawang\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> range\n\n<$B> \n\nI went last evening also\n\n\nNo I graduated from the range and on the course already\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd uh I think it's good lah because it's uphill and downhill\nso it does keep you physically quite fit\n\n\nI was telling Barbara that now I'm so disciplined that I wake up\nso early and you know\n\n<$A> \n\nWow\n\n<$B> \n\nI I don't feel so tired uhm\n\n\nI'm really on the go so uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm the new Catherine uh \n\n<$B> \n\nYa ha ha ha ha no I don't know how long that is\n\n\nI mean it's not like those early days and we all were like so\nstressed and you know\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nYa I I think those days when I looked back at it it's like I\nI I looked at it like from you know\n\n\nIt's as though you know it's a nightmare\n\n\nI mean you know\n\n\nThere must I mean\n\n<$A> \n\nYa it's like that things have been much more <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nYa and then like more space for people

o'clock\n\n\nThey would have call me and inform me\n\n\nI said okay\n\n<$B> \n\nWe we did\n\n<$A> \n\nHe came\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nLate or not eleven\n\n\nSo you were late is it\n\n\nEleven-thirty\n\n\nThen he waited till twelve\n\n\nYou didn't show up twelve-thirty <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nThen in the end he went for lunch uh\n\n<$B> \n\nYou went to lunch with him\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nAiyo\n\n<$A> \n\nThen he decided to go back home <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nJust simple lighting lah\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nI told him the only elaborate ones where he requires to have\nsome kind of shadow effect is your Agreement right\n\n\nThen all the others we can just make do with whatever lights they\nhave\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nSo he said okay\n\n<$B> \n\nEven if I mean worse come to worse just me a full\n\n<$A> \n\nYa lah just\n\n<$B> \n\nJust a full\n\n<$A> \n\nIlluminate the place\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nNo lah I think it'll go to be very simple\n\n\nJJ doesn't have uhm elaborate dimmer system when lights\n\n<$B> \n\nNo school has that\n\n<$A> \n\nNone of the schools have that\n\n<$B> \n\nNone\n\n\nBut AJ is is okay because some schools you can't get access to go\nthe other side of the stage you know\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nJJ\n\n\nIt's impossible that's why I don't want to go down\n\n<$A> \n\nQuite good know\n\n<$B> \n\nHa\n\n<$A> \n\nWindow town\n\n<$B> \n\nIs it\n\n<$A> \n\nYa they have uh back passage\n\n<$B> \n\nAh Outram stage very good\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> space and <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nOutram's Outram stage has got like Kallang Theatre size\n\n<$A> \n\nAh\n\n<$B> \n\nDeep very deep\n\n<$A> \n\nCan go round\n\n<$B> \n\nYa it's very nice and the it's dark you see because the\nwindows all covered\n\n\nSo you can do all sort of things\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's like auditorium\n\n<$B> \n\nLights are a bit primitive lah but at least you can\n\n<$A> \n\nYou still have\n\n\nThey have a dimmer system also\n\n<$B> \n\nThey don't\n\n\nBut they got CD player and all\n\n\nI mean sound sound wise is good\n\n\nBut I think even if they don't have the dimmer system\n\n\nAt least can add lights and have a difference to it\n\n\nRather than the other school halls where the windows are all so\nbright and you can't <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nThe lights won't have any effects lah\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nEspecially it's a school-hall\n\n\nIt's very bright even if you switch off the lights\n\n\nIn fact uh if if the place is very bright I rather not use lights\n\n\nI mean coloured lights just use the the normal one\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nIt looks better\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause I think for <unclear> word </unclear> these these\ncolours will probably not work as well as say red or yellow\n\n<$A> \n\nIt be it appear too diffuse\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nYou didn't read your article ah\n\n<$B> \n\nI didn't I have not\n\n\nPeople just told me about it\n\n<$A> \n\nThe article was quite good actually\n\n<$B> \n\nIs it\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat did it say\n\n<$A> \n\nVery well written\n\n\nAt at times it was\n\n<$B> \n\nI didn't meet her know\n\n<$A> \n\nConfusing <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nYou didn't ah\n\n\nThen\n\n<$B> \n\nShe just got most of the info from Victorian and the and then\nshe she spoke to me on the phone for about about five five ten minutes\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause it's interesting\n\n\nThe the lead article right uh when you started out the article\nthey had this statement saying that uh you know Zaini <unclear> word\n</unclear> bah bah and then left a a regular paying job\n\n<$B> \n\nOh like that\n\n<$A> \n\nDevote his time to dance\n\n<$B> \n\nThat that angle is it\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay so it started out like that\n\n\nBut then after that it went all the way that you are the artistic\n<unclear> word </unclear> and all administrative <unclear> word </unclear>\nassistant coordinating the NUS Dance Ensemble and <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd they put that is it\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay they put all that and then uh if <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n\nHe said he what he abandon his dream to become a teacher\n\n<$B> \n\nOh God really ah\n\n<$A> \n\nYa abandon his dream to become a teacher or whatever uh to\ndevote his time uh you know\n\n\nBecause his love for art uh for dance over rule everything else\nthat kind of thing okay\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> So that went that\n\n\nThen towards the end he said that uh if you if you ever uh know\nyou talk about that\n\n\nYou you you did your degree right\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uh\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd the he said you had so no one can grudge you on the fact\nyou're not studying lah <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nOh oh\n\n<$A> \n\nNeglect your education and all that\n\n\nAnd the that if you were to decide to leave\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd you've a degree\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat you're doing now you can always fall back on your degree\nand on teaching with with say <unclear> word </unclear> lah\n\n<$B> \n\nShe said that ah\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n\nBut then I was thinking that MOE may not find that very very\nflattering that you consider it like you know if everything else fails then\nyou fall back on teaching\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nWhen I saw that I saw that that line I said\n\n\nIs this <unclear> word </unclear> okay good lah not not too bad\n\n\nThat that one line uh\n\n\nIf I was MOE and interview\n\n\nOh I see\n\n<$B> \n\nGo and tell to MOE lah\n\n\nYou got no choice okay\n\n<$A> \n\nYou want you take\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nThere are other fish in the sea you know\n\n\nBut I haven't got my interview you know\n\n<$A> \n\nActually uhm but you want to teach right\n\n\nThat's the thing you see\n\n\nThey may consider they may even offer you a position in in in NTU\nor NIE to say take care of dance\n\n\nThat means you join the Ministry and dance like inspector for\ndance kind of thing\n\n\nThen you go around the schools and things\n\n<$B> \n\nI wouldn't mind\n\n<$A> \n\nIf you like uh maybe you should explore that area rather than\ngo into teaching\n\n\nBecause I tell you uh you may enjoy teaching very much now but\nwhether you really want to start teaching Geography\n\n<$B> \n\nHave you tried\n\n\nHave you have you prepared this speech to me before <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no no\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's why you're so hesistant about telling me this\n\n<$A> \n\nNo I've I've told I've mentioned this to you before what\n\n<$B> \n\nBut you never told me about the alternative\n\n<$A> \n\nIs it\n\n<$B> \n\nAbout this inspector of dance\n\n<$A> \n\nNo that one <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nI was just thinking about it for sometime\n\n<$B> \n\nMy cousin is the inspector of music\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah you see they have these positions right so in the past\n\n\nWhat they did was they just uh kind of promoted teachers who were\nin charge of dance or music or whatever and then just upgraded them usually\nsenior inspectors for music and are <unclear> word </unclear> extracurricular\nactivity or whatever they call them\n\n<$B> \n\nYa <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nTakes care of dance as well you see\n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nThen usually they're neither dance dancers and so <unclear>\nword </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nBut they they usually started on teachers uh they were they\n\n<$A> \n\nYa they become teachers first\n\n\nBut then MOE also have a scheme where they bring in professionals\nthat come in you know directly and then teach dance like in in uh NTU they\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd damn tiring to teach dance you know\n\n\nI find I don't know lah\n\n\nI find need\n\n<$A> \n\nIt could be very tiring\n\n<$B> \n\nI find it very\n\n\nOne thing about me uh\n\n\nI have to do sideline\n\n\nI cannot I I'm not a one track kind of person\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> No that's why what I meant was that\nuhm if you you want dance to in a sense uh complement what\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat I do\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat you do right rather than it being the main thing\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nBut then you find that uh I don't know lah\n\n\nI I've seen a lot of people who've gone into teaching and then\nfind that they can spare time later to do dance or whatever\n\n\nYou find that it drains you so much that you will not benefit\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nYa it's true\n\n\nBut I mean idealistically speaking I just want to get money and\nand studying dance somewhere\n\n\nThat's idealistically and and like not even wanting to come back\nand work and hold some kind of responsible position I I\n\n<$A> \n\nGreat\n\n<$B> \n\nGood lah\n\n\nBut wish but that's not my primary concern right now I mean like\n\n<$A> \n\nYou never you would never consider going say joining say SDT\nor it's very <unclear> word </unclear> lifestyle\n\n<$B> \n\nIf I come out \n\n<$A> \n\nBut I heard that they were expanding themselves\n\n<$B> \n\nYa but if I come in I I don't like to come in because I'm\nI'm not a technical dancer but I'm a dancer- ideas <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nSo I you know so I rather work on my own <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nWith experiments\n\n<$B> \n\nYa and create something\n\n\nSo I don't know whether whether I'll call myself a choreographer\nfirst or a dancer first\n\n\nBut the thing I wanna call myself I don't know I <unclear> word\n</unclear> I don't know what you call it lah\n\n\nBut I I like I find my greatest joy uhm sharing whatever things I\nhave with others <unclear> word </unclear> which is actually teaching", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nPeck Chuan uh\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nSo what's your comment about tomorrow's meeting\n\n<$B> \n\nTomorrow ah\n\n\nAh tomorrow we're having our staff meeting and I hope Dr Teo can uh\nlet us know our future direction clearer\n\n\nBecause uhm I think we're thinking of moving into a lot of new areas\nbut uhm we must have a clear direction and clear commitment from the\nmanagement\n\n\nOtherwise is a bit difficult for people like us at the bottom\n\n<$A> \n\nSo uhm is is the restructuring of the organisation affecting\nyou anyway\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm ya talking about this restructuring\n\n\nActually I haven't gone through the the the whole structure what's\nit's going to be like\n\n\nBecause this morning I don't have time to read the thing and the\nlast meeting I wasn't there\n\n\nBut from what I know is for our team uhm we won't be affected that\nmuch because you know next time when our our side merge with your your team\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nWe're going to merge right\n\n<$A> \n\nIn July\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm and then I think some for our side our people uh will be\nmainly doing the the back back end work uh whereas talking to users would be\nmore from your your side and I I <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nYou mean that kind of thing including the three major\ndepartments\n\n<$B> \n\nWhich three\n\n<$A> \n\nLike Bursar's and so on\n\n<$B> \n\nYa ya ya\n\n<$A> \n\nWe'll be the frontline\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nFor all all the <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nI I I'm not so sure exactly how they're going to uh divide the\nwork lah but from what I know it's uhm uhm people like Diane myself Shuefen\n\n\nThey all will be doing development work and then when users have\nproblem they won't call us directly they will call I don't know who from your\nside would be but I think you're one of them uhm when the printer got problem\nthey call you\n\n<$A> \n\nYou mean you mean normal problem\n\n\nWhat I'm referring to is those uhm as I said uh the accounting\nsystem you know\n\n<$B> \n\nYa so if if there is any of uh any problems that belongs to\nsay say a particular application ah they will still go to the frontline\npeople and if those people cannot solve it then they will channel back to the\nback up people\n\n<$A> \n\nOh I see\n\n<$B> \n\nSo because uh if say right now uh if the user say our user the\naccount user they they printer got problem they will still call us you know\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nBut next time this one should be solved by the <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat you mean is that uhm we'll sort of act as a buffer\n\n<$B> \n\nUh the interface uh\n\n<$A> \n\nSolve the the minor minor problems we'll solve\n\n\nBut when it comes to a more the more specialised programmes we'll\nlook you'll look into that\n\n<$B> \n\nYa I think for you guys uh I think you'll still be involved in\nsome development work lah\n\n\nBut I think most of the time you're attending to user\n\n<$A> \n\nI hope not because it's supposed to be twenty twenty per cent\nthe most\n\n<$B> \n\nHa\n\n<$A> \n\nAm I right\n\n\nAnd uh I think we'll be also involved development work\n\n<$B> \n\nAh\n\n<$A> \n\nFor me is uh postgrad schools ya and that's already a lot of\nmaintenance actually\n\n<$B> \n\nYou expect to get other project\n\n<$A> \n\nYa ya\n\n\nIn fact at the moment only one school is is having the the system\nrunning so there there are three more actually\n\n\nDon't know when the\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nhopefully new\n\n<$B> \n\nThe S Q L D S thing that you're working on\n\n<$A> \n\nHa\n\n\nWhat S Q L D S\n\n<$B> \n\nI thought I thought I thought you have to do some S Q L work\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm you mean oh assessing to the database is it\n\n<$B> \n\nAh\n\n<$A> \n\nOf course that is that's where all the records are stored\n\n<$B> \n\nAll these while you're working on this system lah\n\n<$A> \n\nYes yes but of course the system sort of like retrieve and\nmanipulates the data in the database\n\n\nBy the way uh Weiying is supposed to back me up\n\n<$B> \n\nWho\n\n<$A> \n\nWeiying from your group\n\n<$B> \n\nWeiyan uh\n\n<$A> \n\nAh Weiyan ya suppose to\n\n\nShe's suppose to uhm back me up\n\n<$B> \n\nIn this system uh\n\n<$A> \n\nYa which is a surprise to me\n\n<$B> \n\nSince when\n\n<$A> \n\nHa\n\n\nI mean it's going to start in July or so\n\n<$B> \n\nOh oh\n\n<$A> \n\nSo she's going to be my back up for this thing\n\n<$B> \n\nOh you're the main one\n\n<$A> \n\nThat's why I was wondering is is that what's considered as\nmerging you know between the two groups that you know backing up each other\nthat kind of thing\n\n<$B> \n\nFunny thing her system\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd I won't think of it as a front line\n\n<$B> \n\nHer her her system of taking over then she go and assist\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's just like physically uh changing office now\n\n\nJob wise also change\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause actually uh you know I'm also working on this exam\nmark entry system right\n\n\nActually this one is done by done by a staff quite sometime ago lah\nand then a William took over and now I was ask to look into it further and\n\n<$A> \n\nFurther you mean enhancement\n\n<$B> \n\nYa maybe got to rewrite the whole thing lah\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause ah because we're facing a lot of problems\n\n\nWe our there are a lot of departments using it and then they're all\nover the campus\n\n\nAnd then one once they call up complain that there's a problem\n\n\nWe can't solve it on the spot we have to go down so it takes a lot\nof our time\n\n\nSo we're trying to find out ways to cut down on all this travelling\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm that means more or less cut down on maintenance lah\n\n<$B> \n\nYa ya especially ya this thing is only used during exam time\nlah so\n\n<$A> \n\nOnce\n\n<$B> \n\nDuring this period\n\n<$A> \n\nOnce a year that sort of thing\n\n<$B> \n\nYa and uh and also for me during this period uh is the the\naccount section\n\n\nThey're having their year-end closing so it's a lot of work at us\nat the same time\n\n\nSo this one got to look into it lah\n\n\nI'm currently looking into ways to improve and uh cut down on the\nthe travelling\n\n<$A> \n\nImproving uh by adding on or changing the system or to cut\ncompletely new you know\n\n\nlanguage or whatever\n\n<$B> \n\nOr I don't know my boss was saying look into client server\nsolution pos\n\n\nThat's one possibility ah but I don't think uhm this justifies\nbecause this\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's too expensive\n\n<$B> \n\nIs going to take up too much time\n\n\nI rather you know during uh this period you can do a bit of\nwalking around rather than <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> users uh\n\n<$B> \n\nYa <unclear> word </unclear> users than to spend a months to\nredevelop to whole thing\n\n<$A> \n\nBut then if you redevelop it'll be let me think in the long\nrun it'll be beneficial to everyone\n\n<$B> \n\nYes ya but the thing is when you rewrite probably five years\nlater you've got to revamp the whole thing again\n\n\nSo the thing is whether spending this six months is is worth or\nnot for this next five months ah sorry five years and during these five years\nis not you're not using it everyday\n\n\nYou're only using it during the exam period\n\n<$A> \n\nBut then you must see that uhm how about personally for\nsaying to think that is beneficial to you\n\n\nI mean you'll be learning a lot of new things\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nI think you find it quite interesting uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nYa uh I was telling my boss lah to use it as a as a learning\nplatform\n\n\nThat's very good because if you were to move into client server\nnext time we need to start off with some simple project uhm\n\n\nWe need to start off with some prototypes so that we can iron out\n\n\nWe can avoid uhm committing some serious uhm mistakes in uh in the\nreal system you see so this is a a a good application to start off with lah\n\n\nSo uhm but if you were to develop purely for saving time one then\nI think this is not the right approach ah probably adding or modifying the\nexisting programme is better\n\n\nAh so so let's talk about more your work\n\n<$A> \n\nMy my work uh\n\n\nUh at the moment I'm I'm doing of maintenance work and looking\ninto development of uh uh some of the subsystem in addition to this\nassistance system maintenance\n\n\nAnd uhm it still requires a lot of enhancement\n\n\nAnd uh it seems that the system I mean the department is very\ndynamic\n\n\nThey change things uh now and then you see with new subjects you\nsee with new subjects and so on coming in\n\n\nSo that requires a lot of changes to the system and that keeps me\nvery busy ya\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd on top of that you still got to support what Word Perfect\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm those are normal uh user supports lah located a a couple\nfaculties to take I mean to take care of all the secretaries and so on for\nthe O A System and general PC problem\n\n<$B> \n\nActually uh actually is quite interesting and quite good to\nhave exposure to to do some uhm PC work\n\n\nUh if it is just purely mainframe then it's quite boring at times\n\n<$A> \n\nUh quite true because mainframe seems that there are much\nmore restrictions than PCs\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd\n\n<$B> \n\nActually now I'm also I'm looking into some uhm uhm tax\nretrieval and document management system\n\n<$A> \n\nIs it\n\n<$B> \n\nYa it's actually for the personnel department you know\n\n\nThey have a lot of minutes\n\n\nThey keep a lot of minutes for the Senate meetings\n\n<$A> \n\nI think at the moment there is a existing uh system as what\nyou describe uh\n\n<$B> \n\nYou mean used by the\n\n<$A> \n\nUsing status <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nDo they consider that\n\n\nNo\n\n<$B> \n\nNo we have to look into alternative solution we're not\n\n<$A> \n\nYou mean exclusive of that\n\n<$B> \n\nYa ya ya uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nI mean since it's already there\n\n\nWhy not to take a look at it and see whether it it you know it's\nuseful for your department\n\n<$B> \n\nI'm I'm not quite sure why we're not going to use that\n\n\nProbably because the support for it has uh uh is not there anymore\n\n\nI'm I'm not very sure\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's still there\n\n<$B> \n\nIs it\n\n<$A> \n\nI'm supporting it\n\n<$B> \n\nNo no no I mean vendor support\n\n<$A> \n\nOh vendor support hah uh ya\n\n\nI'm not too sure about that\n\n<$B> \n\nMaybe there's no more upgrade anymore or what\n\n\nI'm not so sure\n\n<$A> \n\nYou mean it's a dead\n\n<$B> \n\nYa ya but it's working lah\n\n\nFuture enhancement\n\n\nProbably there isn't any\n\n<$A> \n\nOh I see so you're looking into vendor <unclear> word\n</unclear> that is growing\n\n<$B> \n\nWe're looking into PC solutions\n\n\nIs that a PC based or mainframe based\n\n<$A> \n\nMainframe\n\n<$B> \n\nYa we're looking more into the PC\n\n<$A> \n\nBut PC I thought you have uhm stoage limitations\n\n<$B> \n\nOh nowadays PC can support up to quite uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nBut talk about just\n\n<$B> \n\nLarge capacity\n\n<$A> \n\nPersonnel Department is okay\n\n\nHow about in future to use for other departments\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm no\n\n<$A> \n\nJust\n\n<$B> \n\nActually even in Personnel also the requirement can be very\nvery high because you're talking about storing uhm uhm all documents you know\nbelonging to each staff belonging to student\n\n\nSo when you apply for a job and then your resume your application\nform everything this probably got to be stored electronically lah\n\n\nSo by scanning in as an image and uh uh storing on uhm secondary\nstorage devise\n\n<$A> \n\nLike what like what CD-Rom\n\n<$B> \n\nOptical disc\n\n<$A> \n\nOptical disc\n\n<$B> \n\nYa it's something called Optical Judebox and that stores many\noptical disks but then these are very very expensive\n\n\nSo currently we are just looking into it lah\n\n<$A> \n\nSo what's the chances how's the chance like\n\n<$B> \n\nUh with that like of budget we have I think it's quite\ndifficult to get uh a a very sophisticated system lah\n\n\nWe're just looking into the <unclear> word </unclear> feasibility\nlah and not not the actual product yet\n\n\nAnd also the user side has not identified exactly what should be\n<unclear> word </unclear> archive into into uh uh computerised system\n\n\nSo that's why I these days I have to call up a lot of vendor \n\n\nI got a lot of meeting go for a lot of seminars\n\n<$A> \n\nIs for this purpose\n\n<$B> \n\nWhich is quite interesting lah\n\n<$A> \n\nOh oh oh I thought all the while is current server\n\n<$B> \n\nCurrent server also\n\n\nThat one is looking into uh Oracle Database Diane and myself lah\n\n<$A> \n\nI thought it's Informix\n\n<$B> \n\nPreviously we're looking at Informix and Oracle plus some\nhardware\n\n\nBut uhm you know there's this task force current server task\nforce so they delegate the work lah\n\n\nSo actually we're not in the task force but I don't why I got\nthis got to do this also\n\n\nDiane and myself we got task to look into Oracle\n\n\nInteresting\n\n<$A> \n\nUh seems like we have talked quite a lot already uh\n\n\nI was thinking of uh we're talking about the just now you\nmentioned about uhm optical disk is it\n\n\nThere are other alternatives right other than optical disk\n\n\nI think uhm there's this\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat\n\n<$A> \n\nAny other alternatives since you said it was expensive\n\n<$B> \n\nActually uhm if you talk about if optical disk has very very\nhigh storage capacity\n\n\nIf you talk about cost per bit ah per bit of storage ah optical\nDisk is definitely cheaper than other means like magnetic tapes uh or not uh\nsorry magnetic disc our our normal uhm hard disk uhm but\n\n<$A> \n\nThe initial cost is high\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm again in the long run is is\n\n<$B> \n\nCheaper actually ya because you can store a lot more\n\n<$A> \n\nSo it really depends on how much data you have lah\n\n\nWhether you real it's really necessary to get\n\n<$B> \n\nCorrect\n\n<$A> \n\nOptical disk\n\n<$B> \n\nYa so it's for for example uhm well government department\nfor example our Inland Revenue you collect so many forms right\n\n\nIf you were to keep them you need a big warehouse so\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd if it catch fire that's it\n\n<$B> \n\nYa ya and you cannot duplicate", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f441b926-7c52-4b5e-a4f7-1b48e89b2f58", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.435172+00:00"}

also\n\n\nThey have English one and Chinese one\n\n\nI should have asked for Chinese and English\n\n\nThen I try which one I get in\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause like this kind of of stuff uh radio is mainly

something\n\n\nThen also three referees that can commend on your research ability\nas well\n\n<$A> \n\nOh that means that will have to be academics\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nAll the academics from Australia\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd I only have maximum two 'cause our ours our department is\nso small\n\n\nUnless I go to the French department which I don't think they\nshould be able to commend on my

was\n\n<$A> \n\nSo cool <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nSo that's why his friends keep tabs on you ah\n\n<$A> \n\nWell he thinks I am damn helpless uh\n\n\nHe probably is not aware that I am so much more intelligent than\nhim in every way\n\n\nAh how does he know I am not pretending to be helpless just to make\nhim feel good\n\n\nThat's why I tell you men are so damn stupid\n\n<$B> \n\nNo oh ya that's what I go through\n\n\nI always play the like fragile dame damsel in distress\n\n\nAnd he that's what that was the term that he used for to describe\nme fragile\n\n<$A> \n\nOh that's exactly the term that my boyfriend uses to describe\nme too\n\n<$B> \n\nReally\n\n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nYes I mean you find it hard to believe right knowing me\n\n\nThat's why that's why they don't know what they're talking about\nyou know\n\n\nThey're just so stupid\n\n<$B> \n\nFragile fragile ah okay uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nWell I suppose like uhm they have this uhm sort of believe\ndreams that they want their women to be this way\n\n\nThey want their women to be that way you know\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd they always want to play hero\n\n\nThey want to be the hero\n\n<$A> \n\nOh ya so tough but in my case he likes it that I am\nindependent and\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd he wishes you to be more independent than you already are\nor to show him\n\n<$A> \n\nNo\n\n<$B> \n\nThat you are more independent than what you are showing him\nnow\n\n<$A> \n\nActually he allows me to be independent because I am supposed\nto be on home ground\n\n\nSo I cannot go round right being on home ground\n\n\nGee what a weird way of thinking\n\n<$B> \n\nI think that that's where you can go wrong\n\n\nDefinitely wrong because you are more familiar with the territory\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm that's right\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd you can be up to more nonsense than\n\n<$A> \n\nYa true\n\n<$B> \n\nIf you're on foreign ground\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause this is your territory\n\n<$A> \n\nQuite true but anyway\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat he doesn't know doesn't wouldn't hurt him right\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm no\n\n\nHis rationale is that well I'm in home ground so I can be allowed\na lot more freedom\n\n\nBut later on when we move away and I am in a strange land than I\nthink he would sort of keep uh\n\n<$B> \n\nCloser tabs\n\n<$A> \n\nYa that's right\n\n<$B> \n\nReally\n\n<$A> \n\nI think so\n\n<$B> \n\nSo no wonder you were saying is like bye bye to freedom in\nmore ways than one\n\n<$A> \n\nNo he probably thinks that uhm that you know I'll behave\nmyself when I am here because uhm well\n\n\nBut you know over there I might not behave myself so much\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n\nIs her right\n\n<$A> \n\nI think he's wrong\n\n\nI'll probably behave myself there\n\n\nAnyway I don't have time to go around\n\n<$B> \n\nYa you'll probably be so busy and caught up with your work\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm okay lah let's not talk about men they're such boring\nsubjects\n\n<$B> \n\nYa but you kind of live with them you can't live without them\n\n<$A> \n\nOh that's what they say about us too right\n\n\nWho said that uh\n\n\nI seem to remember hearing these words just uh a few days ago\n\n\nWere you the one who said it\n\n<$B> \n\nNope not me\n\n<$A> \n\nWho told me the same thing\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's a common phrase so you know\n\n<$A> \n\nOh but someone one said it and in this context too when we're\ntalking about\n\n<$B> \n\nMen\n\n<$A> \n\nNo that person was talking about women\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd he was saying like you can't live with them and you can't\nlive without them\n\n\nHe was referring to women\n\n\nNow who was it uh\n\n\nAh well I guess that's my boyfriend's right\n\n\nI have too many boy-friends\n\n<$B> \n\nCan't remember\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't know who tells me what uhm okay\n\n<$B> \n\nProbably\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay let's get back to our office politics here you know\nthat's more interesting\n\n\nSo what do you think will happen now if uhm our friend Maureen\ncomes back\n\n\nOh but she'll be so much it it'll be so much if she comes back and\nwhen I'm still around\n\n\nBut not likely to be I suppose\n\n<$B> \n\nProbably not but uhm well I heard from somebody that she\nactually she she actually stepped on a few toes while she was here\n\n<$A> \n\nShe steps on her toes\n\n<$B> \n\nOh and but\n\n<$A> \n\nBut she is a great favourite with the boss\n\n<$B> \n\nYa but like if she step on her toes than why the hell does\nshe we're all excreted to\n\n<$A> \n\nOh well I think she has been specifically instructed by the\nman himself to say that we're so happy to hear that you're coming back you\nknow\n\n\nAnd all that uh I tell you that woman can be so double faced you\nknow\n\n<$B> \n\nProbably\n\n<$A> \n\nWell\n\n<$B> \n\nAre you going out to lunch\n\n<$A> \n\nUh I had my lunch uhm and actually I had a very heavy lunch\n\n\nHad potatoes and had salad I\n\n<$B> \n\nWhere\n\n<$A> \n\nPotato Kentucky Fried Chicken you know\n\n<$B> \n\nOh you went out\n\n<$A> \n\nThe soft potato that whipped potato\n\n<$B> \n\nYou went out\n\n<$A> \n\nNo actually it was yesterday's one\n\n\nI couldn't finish it I couldn't eat it at all in the fridge\n\n\nOh you're ribbons are quite nice\n\n<$B> \n\nYap so you just tie\n\n<$A> \n\nActually uhm how much did it cost you buy these ribbons\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm if you get a ready made one it's sixty cents\n\n\nBut if you get the whole roll like you know something like this\nit's two bucks\n\n<$A> \n\nOh ya\n\n<$B> \n\nThen you can make\n\n<$A> \n\nI suppose it's more economical\n\n<$B> \n\nYa what it's so troublesome\n\n\nI mean I did one to show Jenny Jenny's daughter how to do it and\nthat was it\n\n\nI never expected her to like come back and say please ask me to\nmake another one\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo well hack\n\n\n'Cause I'm not doing anything\n\n\nAnyway I told Ellice very flatly I have lost the desire to work\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then what happens now\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know I just wait and see whether that guy's offer\ncomes through\n\n\nIf it does I'll be so glad to go away\n\n<$A> \n\nOh where is her now\n\n<$B> \n\nHe's somewhere in Singapore\n\n\nHe'll be here for the next couple of days and after that he's\ngoing back to Sydney\n\n<$A> \n\nOh and\n\n<$B> \n\nSo I don't know\n\n<$A> \n\nHa has he got your address\n\n\nHe may write to you from there\n\n<$B> \n\nHe's going to fax me from Sydney\n\n<$A> \n\nWould it be wise\n\n<$B> \n\nSo\n\n<$A> \n\nI mean people would be able to read you know your letters\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nMaybe he should write to you instead of faxing\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I gave him the card my card here and I I could always\nget in touch with him before I leave\n\n\nSo uhm I hope\n\n<$A> \n\nWell anyway even after you leave and you expect faxes I can\ntake them for you and pass it to you so no problem okay\n\n<$B> \n\nNo no\n\n\nI not that worried 'cause Jenny's the one closest to the fax\n\n\nSo she's on the look out\n\n<$A> \n\nOh ya\n\n\nThat's right you know\n\n<$B> \n\nSo that's okay you know\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm but make sure it doesn't get into the wrong hands because\nyou'll never know\n\n<$B> \n\nI know I know\n\n\nOur bosses are like dead curious I think because like both of them\nsaw me with him and if and they were pretty curious judging from the\nexpressions\n\n\nBecause like Miss Ng walking up and down three times and even when\nhe was in my room she like went to and fro Mabel's room a couple of times and\neach time non fail she look in and Sakuma was passing like walking up and\ndown like for no apparent reason \n\n\nAnd of all things he was driving up the road when we were walking\ndown", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "543e7630-b2e4-4189-93ee-4dfa06ad9412", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nMy sister was trying to teach him to read his alphabets\n\n<$B> \n\nThe three year old one\n\n<$A> \n\nAh the three year old one\n\n\nHe is like very slow but he can recognise places and all that you\nknow\n\n\nJust that when you teach him uh he doesn't want to repeat after you\nso she got so she got so mad\n\n<$B> \n\nI think you can't force them\n\n<$A> \n\nYa you can't force them\n\n<$B> \n\nMy kids also\n\n\nWhen I try to read to them they will hold the book and bite the book\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nRun away with the book\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause I think at this time the attention span is very short\n\n<$A> \n\nYa very short\n\n\nI think different lah because I remember my first nephew ah who's\nnow in the poly already ah so uhm I think <unclear> word </unclear> of his\nage he would've been able to listen to stories you know\n\n\nI tell him stories and then he would be interested\n\n\nBut uh this boy quite not so interested one\n\n\nHe is interested in cars and he likes car\n\n\nHe will play with his cars all the time\n\n<$B> \n\nMy kids love balls\n\n\nEvery time they go to ball ball ball ball\n\n\nThen they scream until you buy for them\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo now what we do is we keep a pack of balloons in the bag\n\n\nSo when they scream for ball we give them one balloon\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nBut it's not very good lah to give in to them all the time\n\n\nThen they will they will think that you know\n\n<$A> \n\nYa especially if you bring them shopping\n\n\nThen they start screaming it'll be terrible\n\n<$B> \n\nActually my friend told me it's not very good to buy things in\nfront of them\n\n\nIf they want it later on you come back to buy\n\n\nIf you buy on the spot they get the idea that whatever they want\nyou buy\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I think most Singaporean kids are spoilt because now they\nonly have two or three only\n\n<$A> \n\nActually it's very very tiring looking after kids\n\n<$B> \n\nYa I must have aged a lot you know giving birth\n\n<$A> \n\nLook but at least once they grow up you you are free lah\n\n<$B> \n\nYa more relaxed\n\n<$A> \n\nUh\n\n<$B> \n\nI think one thing good about twins is that they can play\ntogether you see\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nSo now when I see them sometimes one hug the other or what\ngive them two biscuits they will give one to the one\n\n\nYou feel quite nice\n\n<$A> \n\nShare\n\n<$B> \n\nAh share you see\n\n\nI think they like to call each other name you know\n\n\nRefer to each other their own code you know very funny\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nLike Timothy uh Jeremy will call him Ti\n\n\nDon't know why you know Ti\n\n\nTi so funny\n\n<$A> \n\nAh then the other one call\n\n<$B> \n\nThe other one will call Jeremy Xie because Jeremy is Yenxie\nyou see\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nSomehow he call him Xie\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo when you give him their pacifier they know which one is\ntheirs 'cause different shapes\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo if you give him Jeremy's one he will say Xie Xie Xie Xie so\ncute\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n\nBut you can you can are they I mean can they be distinguished or\nnot\n\n\nOf course you would know lah that the mother\n\n<$B> \n\nMost of the time to us they look quite different\n\n\nBut somedays uh suddenly they would very much the same lah\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nBut Jeremy has a mole quite high up here lah\n\n<$A> \n\nOh so you can recognise it\n\n<$B> \n\nAt first when they had no mole we have to tie things to their\nlegs lah because the hospital tied things you see\n\n<$A> \n\nOh I see\n\n<$B> \n\nSo we just kept that on just to make sure we don't\n\n<$A> \n\nOh they must me really identical ah\n\n<$B> \n\nTo us they look not so much the same\n\n\nWhen they were younger yes lah\n\n\nThen about four months they uh Jeremy had a mole\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo that was uh much better\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nBut now when you look at the photographs some photographs\ncannot see the mole lah we can't tell\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nAt that time uh we could tell you know\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nFor one of my sister who doesn't come so often she can't tell\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nI think recently after taking no pay leave uh you become hot\ntempered\n\n<$A> \n\nOh when you are with them\n\n<$B> \n\nScream scream\n\n<$A> \n\nWhen you are with them all the time\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nBecause kids are like that\n\n\nYou ask them not to climb they will climb\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n\nSo now especially at a certain age you know they'll start climbing\nyou got to jagar them lah\n\n<$B> \n\nYa because they don't know what is dangerous you know\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nI think when they're about uhm my friend told me eighteen\nmonths\n\n\nThen that time okay because eighteen months they supposedly they\ncan understand you and all that\n\n\nBut I think should be around two to three\n\n<$A> \n\nI think different stages they have different types of problems\n\n<$B> \n\nYa that's true\n\n<$A> \n\nJust like my niece and nep my niece and my nephews\n\n\nThey sort of they sort of grew up in my home\n\n\nMy eldest nephew my mother sort of took care of him for about um\ntwo over years uh uh because my sister-in-law was working full-time\n\n\nSo quite difficult lah for them\n\n\nBy the time they come home they had a baby-sitter and they come\nback about eight something then haven't cook and all that you know\n\n\nSo my mother said okay lah come and you know she'll look after\n\n\nAnd he sort of practically grew up and he was the first grandchild\nso very pampered you know and uh\n\n\nThen after that the others they sort of maybe the others didn't\nstay as long as this eldest one you see\n\n\nThen I this one my this present one the three year old one my\nsister comes practically every day\n\n\nSo we see him all the time this boy sort of grew up in this house\nyou know\n\n\nSo I mean at least if when they come in when they come over\nthey've more of us lah\n\n\nMy mother and all that me my brother you know so you don't get\nonly one\n\n\nIf you're faced with one kid you'll die man the whole day\n\n\nSo sort of like not really take turns lah\n\n\nThe child also got other people to run to you know and play with\n\n<$B> \n\nActually for them especially at the young age interaction\nwith other people is very important\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nBut sometimes you can't sort of draw the line you know\n\n\nI mean like you want them to be sociable yet they don't want them\nto be too sociable\n\n\nBecause they will go to strangers and you know they they don't\n\n\nI mean how to fear strangers they might just follow them\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nBut it's true lah at each stage there is problem\n\n\nThen after they go to school you worry about their homework and\nall that\n\n<$A> \n\nYa that's right\n\n<$B> \n\nThen they <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nMy other sister has two of them\n\n\nOne is already in sec two this girl and then the boy is uh I think\nprimary five or primary six\n\n\nI always get them mixed up\n\n\nShe's always nagging them\n\n\nYa the school system is so competitive\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's why\n\n<$A> \n\nYou've got to make sure that they study and study\n\n<$B> \n\nYa then later you worry about them girlfriend boyfriend\n\n<$A> \n\nYa lah\n\n<$B> \n\nThen after that their work\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nThroughout your life you're worrying\n\n\nEven they settle their family ya then settle down\n\n\nI think you're forever worry worry\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I mean I think when they have kids and then when their\nkids get ill ah\n\n<$B> \n\nYa then you worry about the kids\n\n<$A> \n\nAbout the child\n\n\nI suppose that's part of life lah\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nBut I suppose if he can take it deeply then it's okay\n\n<$A> \n\nNo lah I don't think you think so far ahead one lah\n\n\nYou just when it comes along\n\n<$B> \n\nThen one at a time and that's enough lah\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n\nBut you never thought that you have twins lah\n\n\nYou didn't know lah or or you you knew\n\n<$B> \n\nAt six weeks I knew\n\n<$A> \n\nOh you were more or less prepared lah\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n\nBut if if not prepare it'll be a real shock ah\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nI mean all along I thought it'll be nice to have twins lah\n\n\nThink my brother told me it's fat hopes because of the low low\n\n<$A> \n\nIt doesn't run in the family\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nI remember I told him to record every anything if possible\n\n\nThen it turned out it's true\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I suppose in a way it's quite nice lah you know to bring\nthem up in one shot\n\n<$B> \n\nYa because then they will study together same level\n\n\nI mean initially I think the expenses will be more because we've\nto buy books and everything\n\n\nMaybe but later on I think it's all right\n\n<$A> \n\nDon't know whether it can be so like because like like uhm in\nmy family the niece the nephews hand down lah all hand down\n\n<$B> \n\nI see\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause they all outgrow so quickly and then\n\n<$B> \n\nYa it's true you know\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> rather than throw it away\n\n\nIt's too good to throw away so it get rotated to cousins and\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nI think most people do that but my sister Mary she loves buying\nclothes for them\n\n\nShe insist on wearing the same clothes you know\n\n\nShe keeps buying clothes for them\n\n\nI think most of their clothes they wear two three times only\n\n<$A> \n\nSo many ah\n\n<$B> \n\nNow my whole cupboard is packed\n\n\nI think twenty to thirty suits each\n\n<$A> \n\nWow\n\n<$B> \n\nThen shoes they have so many pairs she like must match match\nthem\n\n\nThat's a waste lah because especially I mean you buy two sets then\nif you have another one you hope it's a girl lah\n\n\nThen you can't really wear unless you sort of <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> I mean dressing them same same you\nknow\n\n\nWhen they are young it's quite fun lah\n\n\nOf course when they grow up they won't like to wear the same ya\n\n\nBut one thing I think I mean I think you they've companionship you\nknow\n\n\nBut the book says you have to sort of uh try to let there be times\nwhen they're separate you know\n\n\nThey need time\n\n<$A> \n\nTo have their own space to grow what\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd also when they grow up of course inevitably there'll be\nsometimes when if they go to different schools or what you know\n\n\nSo from young they should sort of know that there are sometimes\nwhen they are not together otherwise they will feel very insecure once the\nother one is not there\n\n\nWhen the other time when you were doing your exams you were still\nteaching right you had to right\n\n\nWas it very stressful\n\n<$A> \n\nVery stressful and especially this year because I had to go\nto a new school\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nI was uh transfer out\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat school was that uh\n\n\nIt's that\n\n<$A> \n\nKwan Yang\n\n<$B> \n\nKwan Yang\n\n<$A> \n\nGuangyang\n\n<$B> \n\nNever heard\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's at Bishan and it's\n\n<$B> \n\nYangzhong\n\n<$A> \n\nOne of the very very lousy schools\n\n<$B> \n\nHah I don't know\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's at Bishan you know\n\n<$B> \n\nBishan\n\n\nDo you live near there\n\n<$A> \n\nNot so near lah\n\n\nBut it's it's about ten minutes drive\n\n<$B> \n\nNot bad\n\n<$A> \n\nNot not not bad but it's very different from the previous\nschool I was in\n\n\nI was from Cedar you know\n\n\nThat was a girl's school you see so I have no discipline\n\n<$B> \n\nEasier to handle right\n\n<$A> \n\nNo ya easier to handle\n\n\nNo discipline problems just only once stream express\n\n\nThen here we have normal stream normal stream you know and then\nit's mixed co-ed and the and there's discipline problems also\n\n\nSo uhm I it was very difficult lah in in because you know new\nschool new environment new adjustment and all that kind of thing\n\n\nBut I don't know by the grace of god it's still uhm because it was\nit was quite and especially beginning of the year\n\n<$B> \n\nWhen did you join this \n\n<$A> \n\nHa\n\n<$B> \n\nWhen did you join\n\n<$A> \n\nI only went in beginning of the year what\n\n<$B> \n\nOh January\n\n<$A> \n\nWhen school reopens January ya so\n\n\nThen I also don't know whether how the school will take to the\nfact that I am doing this course\n\n\nAnd uh also that's why I mean I was actually\n\n\nAt first I thought at first I thought the our exam would be uh uh\nyou know\n\n\nOriginally our exam plans was what uh\n\n\nNot not what it was Foley actually told us it was something else\nlah\n\n\nSo then when I got the exam timetable and then there was all\nthese series of workshop on Saturdays you know so I was thinking I better\ntell the principal lah because you know you can't take off like that\n\n\nSo I told her lah I said I'm taking a course", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "2958d3eb-1e4a-49e6-80c2-22cc8f45f862", "added":

\n\nQuickly makes up\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd in and we remove it high it can be quite expensive\n\n<$B> \n\nYa that is true\n\n<$A> \n\nThen you order a drink everyday\n\n\nSo I think when he ask me about stationery as you were saying up\nwe should we both should do it together because then I won't leave or\nanything\n\n\nI think we should have a pantry\n\n\nPantry most important\n\n<$B> \n\nWe need a fridge\n\n\nNo get those small fridge\n\n<$A> \n\nYa lah small fridge\n\n\nBut even so I don't know okay\n\n\nI think we should agree not in any need of fridge\n\n\nI think we need a little bit of <unclear> word </unclear> not oven\n\n<$B> \n\nOven-toaster\n\n\nToaster\n\n<$A> \n\nNot toaster\n\n\nBread-toaster\n\n\nThat type you know just heat up a little bit of food\n\n<$B> \n\nYa bread-toaster lor\n\n<$A> \n\nDon't you think not not bread-toaster\n\n\nBread-toaster\n\n<$B> \n\nOven-toaster lah\n\n<$A> \n\nIs just for bread\n\n<$B> \n\nYa ya ya those oven-toaster\n\n<$A> \n\nAh oven-toaster\n\n\nI think we should you know\n\n\nIt's very practical\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I think we we don't yet slowly lah\n\n\nWe get the more essential things first\n\n<$A> \n\nFridge is it\n\n<$B> \n\nFridge\n\n<$A> \n\nFridge is important\n\n\nWe can store things inside\n\n<$B> \n\nYa but\n\n<$A> \n\nLike you put your fruits you bring from home\n\n\nYou put your fruits\n\n\nYou throw inside then then\n\n<$B> \n\nBut not in a hurry\n\n\nYet we get the other things first like the desk and all that first\n\n<$A> \n\nWe need only one more desk\n\n<$B> \n\nOne desk\n\n<$A> \n\nThen chair\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat chair\n\n<$A> \n\nChair\n\n\nWe don't need a chair\n\n<$B> \n\nDon't need ah\n\n<$A> \n\nThere can\n\n\nYou see we got four chairs here already what\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay lor\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay this desk is Boon\n\n\nThat one is for me\n\n\nYours will be the same one\n\n\nAll three of ours three of us should get the same chairs and\ntables\n\n\nOf course he will have this big chair\n\n\nIf he wants to get another table he should get a bigger one for\nhimself\n\n\nAt least both of us share the kind of table\n\n\nThen there won't be some kind of discrepancy\n\n\nThis one will be for this computer like when you are not at your\ndesk working you want to go to the computer you move the computer\n\n\nOkay so we need another desk we need\n\n\nI think we need two cupboards\n\n\nAh how many cupboards do you think we need\n\n<$B> \n\nI think at the moment we don't need more than one cabinet\nbecause he hasn't finished using this one you see\n\n<$A> \n\nHe has quite a lot of things already\n\n<$B> \n\nReally\n\n\nI think he needs to clear because he has a lot of repeated and all\nthose brochures and everything\n\n\nAll repeated\n\n<$A> \n\nI'm never dare to touch\n\n\nI I mean at least Jason help him to\n\n<$B> \n\nMaybe he has uh ya some kind of cabinet lah\n\n<$A> \n\nJust now do you realise he was looking around for something\n\n<$B> \n\nIs it\n\n<$A> \n\nYou won't believe it\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n\nHe need something for storing his film\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't know what kind of\n\n\nYou need a special cabinet\n\n<$B> \n\nBut how long does the film last ha\n\n\nDoes it expire after a while\n\n<$A> \n\nYou keep it properly it can last\n\n<$B> \n\nIt can last ah\n\n<$A> \n\nLook at the way he has kept\n\n\nIt's it's expose to light most of the time and this thing rub up\nand down\n\n\nI I think it's personally that he need a big cabinet\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nSo we need a film cabinet\n\n\nEven we don't have a cabinet\n\n\nWe can buy those kind of bags\n\n<$B> \n\nBags\n\n<$A> \n\nBig bag then you just put inside\n\n<$B> \n\nI thought of buying boxes\n\n<$A> \n\nBox can lah\n\n\nBox can\n\n<$B> \n\nBoxes\n\n\nIkea boxes\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay okay\n\n\nOkay then we get another of this cabinet\n\n\nDo you want to get this type\n\n\nThis looks very ugly\n\n<$B> \n\nBut it's basic\n\n\nThis is the standard office cabinet\n\n<$A> \n\nI think for both of us we need some kind of cupboard also\nright\n\n<$B> \n\nFor our own\n\n<$A> \n\nDo we\n\n<$B> \n\nNo lah we\n\n<$A> \n\nCome out ah\n\n\nOur thing will start piling out on the table already\n\n<$B> \n\nYa you need files\n\n<$A> \n\nWe need some kind of files filing system for our own lah\n\n\nNo\n\n\nWhen you start carrying a lot of things like you send your\ngraphics everything instead of having like maybe yours we have a carrier and\nthe other one the thing is you need to systematically keep\n\n\nYou can't just store up here know\n\n\nLook at mine\n\n\nI mean I've been trying my best to keep it clean then he comes and\nhe meddle up all over again\n\n<$B> \n\nYa that's true\n\n\nMy previous office we have a lot of files one on the table\n\n<$A> \n\nI think we should\n\n\nBut here no file no no ta\n\n<$B> \n\nNo files\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat I mean files on the table\n\n<$B> \n\nOh files on the table <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nI think we should get those types of shelf\n\n<$B> \n\nShelves ah\n\n<$A> \n\nWe should\n\n\nWe can maximise space that way you know\n\n\nThink that shelf you can you put a few file\n\n\nThen put one on top there so it looks really it looks like it's\npart of the desk\n\n<$B> \n\nThat looks like your bedroom\n\n<$A> \n\nNo you can\n\n\nI don't know whether he'll allow if we put shelves\n\n\nShelves maximise space\n\n<$B> \n\nBut for us it's very unoffice like you know\n\n<$A> \n\nReally\n\n\nIf we can make it very cosy\n\n\nWhen do we have to be office like\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat's more\n\n\nWe're advertising agency you know\n\n\nSo it must be as creative as possible\n\n\nWhen I went to Weli ads right it was so cute you know\n\n<$B> \n\nYa is it\n\n<$A> \n\nThe receptionist sits

you\n\n\nEight-seven\n\n<$A> \n\n1987\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's the year you graduated\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's the last year right\n\n\nWithout bond\n\n<$A> \n\nUh no no no there is a bond but you

1987 was a very bad year if you remember so there were\na lot of people applying to to to\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat about Newpaper\n\n\nHow's it\n\n<$A> \n\nNewpaper ah Newpaper was fun\n\n\nIf if I had to go back to full-time work again I think if I had my\nway that would be the best\n\n<$B> \n\nSo you left primarily because of your\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause I got married\n\n\nYou know how you you are you're going to be ready right for the\nhorrible hours\n\n<$B> \n\nBut excuse me this is the this is the you know we we're even\nto have a book publish on women\n\n\nWomen In Singapore\n\n\nUh most women\n\n<$A> \n\nAbout the other women\n\n<$B> \n\nYa most women are ya most women are like you know either\nthey're single\n\n<$A> \n\nNo lah\n\n<$B> \n\nOr they're you know they're\n\n<$A> \n\nLet me tell you lah\n\n\nIn Straits Times most women are either single divorced married\nagain\n\n<$B> \n\nOr they're not straight\n\n<$A> \n\nOr they're not straight\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's quite true so far\n\n<$A> \n\nI'm telling about us from reporters you know\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nThe the the sub-editors are not like that because they lead\npretty regular grave-yard hours you see\n\n\nBecause they're always on grave-yard so they can at least have\nsome order to their lives\n\n\nYou must be prepared because there was one stretch where I was\nworking nine to twelve midnight\n\n\nNine am twelve midnight\n\n\nNine am twelve for four days in a row\n\n\nThat's when I after I've done it was exhilarating and all that\n\n\nYou see if you're on a high you can't sleep at night you know\n\n\nImagine going back at twelve and you've just finished this glo\nglorious story you know\n\n\nYou can't sleep so you know it's very very unhealthy\n\n\nI decided I mean it's not fair\n\n\nWhat if I'm going to get married\n\n\nTo put someone through all that\n\n<$B> \n\nYa that's true lah\n\n<$A> \n\nThere was this woman who perpetually had her husband waiting\noutside\n\n\nBut you see not all husbands can do that know and is it fair or\nnot to ask all husbands do that for you\n\n<$B> \n\nEven if yours did\n\n\nIt it will come a point where\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's too much\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know he says it's too much ya\n\n<$A> \n\nCan you imagine she he would sit you know She would be typing\nher story he'll sit right before\n\n\nAre we finished\n\n\nNo\n\n\nShe he can sit there for four hours you know\n\n<$B> \n\nI think to a certain extent teachers too during term time lah\n\n\nBut at least we have a lull you know like during the break\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nUh they go on holiday you know\n\n<$A> \n\nNo there is no such thing as a lull\n\n\nIf you're a good reporter there's never a lull\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nSo maybe you know you can say that you pace yourself but if\nyou're a good reporter you can never let a story go you know\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's true that's true\n\n<$A> \n\nSo how how how could you\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nYou still dancing or not\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm a bit lah\n\n\nNot not not so much ya\n\n\nThis is suppose\n\n<$A> \n\nYou pig\n\n<$B> \n\nTo mine Chris\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nSo long were you there\n\n<$A> \n\nNewpaper\n\n\nI was there about two and a half years\n\n<$B> \n\nThree years\n\n<$A> \n\ntwo years\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's quite long\n\n<$A> \n\nLong enough lah you know <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nThe but it's a very it's very enjoyable as a single\n\n\nIt's okay\n\n\nBut if you are thinking of marrying I don't think it's very a\nhealthy life\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's true\n\n<$A> \n\nEven as a single\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's a very all consuming thing right isn't it\n\n<$A> \n\nYa it is it is\n\n\nAnd you get jaded very fast\n\n\nYou get very cynical\n\n\nThere was it came to stage where you know\n\n<$B> \n\nAbout what\n\n\nPeople\n\n<$A> \n\nLife\n\n<$B> \n\nLife\n\n<$A> \n\nIn general ya\n\n\nYou mean you you get this jaded that when people call in and say\noh there's an accident along Paterson Road\n\n\nThen you know someone will ask very casually\n\n\nAnybody died or not\n\n\nNobody died\n\n\nAh forget it\n\n\nSo many vehicles\n\n<$B> \n\nI suppose it's just like doctors right after a while you know\n\n<$A> \n\nYa ya ya\n\n\nIt's like you dis you know you could dissect someone eating char\nkway teow or something\n\n<$B> \n\nLike a friend of mine Sheng Kwai was telling me that he has\ngot this friend not friend lah you know BB boy\n\n\nHe became a houseman and you know being Christians and know that\nthey're supposed to be\n\n<$A> \n\nCompassionate\n\n<$B> \n\nCompassionate\n\n\nBut after a while it's like you know treat it like another person\nanother patient you know\n\n\nI mean\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's another body\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nTo cure\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nI mean when you're especially when you're covering say the\nmidnight hours\n\n\nCan you be imagine how much <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nDo you have when you're like half asleep\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd some patients are very difficult\n\n\nSame thing lah\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's true\n\n<$A> \n\nSo I got to I realize lah that I that's not what I want\n\n\nTo become you see\n\n\nYou look around you know and you of course there are people who\nsurvive\n\n\nIf you're talking about Christians there are quite a number of\nvery you know strong Christians\n\n<$B> \n\nIn journalism\n\n<$A> \n\nYes there are but very few of them\n\n<$B> \n\nI suppose Chong Jin will be one of them\n\n<$A> \n\nChong Jin\n\n\nAre you kidding\n\n\nChong Jin is the wayward one\n\n<$B> \n\nBut he was I mean he was\n\n<$A> \n\nHe was like ra ra all fire you know\n\n\nNo he's not anymore\n\n\nThat that scared me\n\n\nI also saw him you know going that way\n\n\nIt you know we used to look up to him like some sort of mo role\nmodel\n\n\nBecause he was one of those who was very uhm he was zealous but\nnot to the extent where he he you know like I I don't know how you describe\nhim\n\n<$B> \n\nNo he strike one as a\n\n<$A> \n\nvery balanced\n\n<$B> \n\nWho's really\n\n\nWho lead a very strong moral fibre\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's no longer so\n\n\nNo but you know you see him fall and he himself has no regrets you\nknow\n\n\nI think from the way he speaks the way he talks about it\n\n\nIt's like it's this one aspect of life\n\n\nAnd he his uh his religion has become a philosophical thing\n\n\nSo it was very scary\n\n\nWe were you know we we did talk quite a bit when we were in there\n\n\nSo it scares you radiant\n\n<$B> \n\nI'm not sure\n\n\nI mean I'm just buying a do you know\n\n\nI just accept this as buying a ticket out of what I'm doing now\n\n\n<$A> \n\nWhich school are you teaching at\n\n<$B> \n\nAhmad Ibrahim\n\n<$A> \n\nHa\n\n<$B> \n\nAhmad Ibrahim Secondary School\n\n<$A> \n\nThat's like way in Jurong\n\n<$B> \n\nUh that's what everybody thinks\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's not ah\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's eventually uh in uh Yishun\n\n<$A> \n\nYishun\n\n<$B> \n\nIt used to be in Upper Thomson Road but they moved\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nYa it's just one of those things lah named after the It's\nsuppose to be the first Malay minister\n\n<$A> \n\nBut it's a very difficult school isn't it It's not not\nnotorious\n\n<$B> \n\nNot really it's supposed to be a the better school in the\nNorth North\n\n<$A> \n\nReally Why do I always have this impression that it's one of\nthose difficult schools\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause of the name Maybe Ahmad Ibrahim you know like Sunila\nUtama\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't know how the students ever live that down Sunila\nUtama I come from Sunila I hope they think of a change you know\n\n<$B> \n\nYa I mean there're so many schools named after roads you\nknow what I mean\n\n<$A> \n\nSo silly There's going to be an Ang Mo Kio Avenue two school\nsomething very soon\n\n<$B> \n\nYa But your school's not good enouh to be named after\nsomebody like somebody substantial But I suppose I think you've always been\nthe kind of person who wants everything in life\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I suppose\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't think you'll settle just for a career\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I don't think so It's it gets to you know after awhile\nyou you realise that a lot of the so-called strong women there you you\nobserve them you know they ya their career is everything it's all consuhming\nthat I think to ex <unclear> word </unclear> They think they're so emanci\nemancipated and you know they are not uhm they they're their own person and\nall actually they're not There're actually slave to their work\n\n<$B> \n\nThey're strong because they have no other choice you see\nWhat are the alternative I mean if they if they don't act strong they have to\nadmit that oh oh\n\n<$A> \n\nThey have chosen the wrong path or ya ya\n\n<$B> \n\nI mean I have known so many S B C producers I mean like uhm\nI mean even Millie who are okay I mean not not sort of like it doesn't sound\nlike our sub-cultural groups lah like you know but normal women who are very\nfeminist but deep down they still have this problem\n\n<$A> \n\nurge\n\n<$B> \n\nwith their emotional dependence\n\n<$A> \n\nI ya I've never been a feminist\n\n<$B> \n\nI think depends on what you mean by feminist I mean you can\nbe a feminist without losing your essential femaleness you know So at the end\nof the day you're made to need somebody\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nSo if you deny that then you deny that part of yourself\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know because a lot of the editors uh are all of course\nthey are all children of the sixties lah No not children of the sixties I\nthink they went throuh the sixties in their teenage years you know So for\nthem you know feminism is such a burning thing But I think in their late\nlater years now like they're in their thirty-nine and forty they start to\nrealise that maybe they've gone wrong But it's too late to admit it isn't it\nwithout losing every you know\n\n<$B> \n\nIt takes a lot of to admit maybe without without making\nsound like you've made a mistake I think that's a sad thing I mean look at\nPat Chan I you still think she's a victim of her own achievements you know I\nthink she has achieved so much you can't even live it down It's like how can\nI ever like you know going for a man You know what is it that he has that I\ndon't You know\n\n<$A> \n\nSpecial organs Why do you think <unclear> word </unclear>\nshe's gonna fix the organs as well\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause I think she's not really I don't know I mean I know\nher as a person\n\n<$A> \n\nBut she's a very charming person you know\n\n<$B> \n\nShe likes to dress up you know she likes to you know\neverytime there's anything new at Issey Miyake she will go and buy but she'll\nonly scarves and shirts I find you know what I mean she's not really I don't\nthink she's I mean more new <unclear> word </unclear> you know\n\n<$A> \n\nBut I thouht she was a the reason why she became like that\nwas her father injecting

where\n\n\nVictoria ah\n\n<$A> \n\nYa that's right\n\n\nOur boys would be down there about three-thirty\n\n<$B> \n\nYou went to Novena already\n\n<$A> \n\nAh no\n\n<$B> \n\nLater\n\n<$A> \n\nI doubt if I can make it for today's session\n\n<$B> \n\nAiyah how terrible\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd I feel bad also but the thing is uhm we're having a\ntournament coming up you see\n\n<$B> \n\nIs it\n\n<$A> \n\norganised by the School of Physical Education and you know\n\n\nSo I was gearing my boys up for the for the championship actually\n\n<$B> \n\nSo you got chance or not\n\n<$A> \n\nWell I'll rate our chances as fifty fifty\n\n<$B> \n\nI thought it's suppose to be at least semi-finals\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm well touch and go but I mean with a bit of luck we may\njust you know even clinch the title actually\n\n<$B> \n\nYou're suppose to ah\n\n\nHow many years already\n\n\nTo date this alternate year suppose to win\n\n<$A> \n\nYa we have but uhm a group and a bunch of dedicated boys you\nknow committed\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat about their coach\n\n<$A> \n\nWell uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nTell me more about him lah the coach\n\n<$A> \n\nWell what can I say\n\n\nI mean you know with that kind of bunch of kids that you have you\nknow\n\n<$B> \n\nIs he a good coach or not\n\n<$A> \n\nand the kind of enthusiasm that they have been showing and\ntraining you know\n\n\nI think that's enough to carry me and get me going carrying on\nwith what the job you see\n\n<$B> \n\nSo you saying the coach is not doing much lah\n\n\nThe boys are helping themselves\n\n<$A> \n\nNo I'm I'm sure the boy it's the boys who are going to be out\nin the field to play ultimately and the and the coach get only do that much\n\n\nFine I I feel deep down you know uhm that I've been quite\ninspirational and in a sense also been uhm very supportive the boys you know\n\n\nAnd they look up to me that sense you know\n\n<$B> \n\nAs a friend rather than a\n\n<$A> \n\nas a friend and also like a an older brother you see\n\n<$B> \n\nSo\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd that's the interesting about teaching you know which I\nreally enjoy because I realise that you know teaching is not just what goes\nround within the perimeters of a classroom\n\n\nIt extends beyond those boundaries\n\n\nAnd just as much as you are learning so much about the students\nyou are also learning so much about yourself\n\n<$B> \n\nTrue true\n\n<$A> \n\nSee and I really enjoy what I am doing actually\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm so shiok lah\n\n\nI then your speech how's your so how does your speech go\n\n<$A> \n\nOh ya\n\n<$B> \n\ntell me\n\n\nI never heard your speech\n\n\nYou're supposed let me hear how it goes\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat what's there to say\n\n\nBut anyway next Saturday by the way uhm the school'll be having a\nspeech day and the Minister of Education Lee Yoke Suan will be down and there\nis a strong probability that I am I have important uh official announcement\nwill be made with regards to independ with regards to autonomous schools and\nand there's a strong chance in fact in fact highly probable that Victoria\nwill be one of the schools going autonomous you see\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat's auto what the difference between autonomous and\nindependent\n\n<$A> \n\nAutonomous are so call what they claim to be uh quality\neducation at a low cost\n\n\nBut we're not really independent in the true sense of the word but\nwe do have certain uhm leeway on the part of our principal you know\n\n<$B> \n\nPlanning and hiring\n\n<$A> \n\nLike like the choice of teachers whom he wants to come over\nto our school and in terms of you know

know\n\n\nI mean theories that you have to I suppose ya lah I mean in a way\nphonology and all that\n\n\nThose are theories right\n\n\nActually in everything is a theoretical construct right\n\n\nBut I like those where you can apply and l love doing parsing\nthings like that\n\n\nI find it very fun\n\n\nI don't like those where you have to memorise and regurgitate\n\n<$A> \n\nThat means you would have hatred for History right\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I never did well in History\n\n\nThe best I got was D7 and an O\n\n<$A> \n\nBut Econs you would have liked Econs\n\n<$B> \n\nYes Econs I I did very

teacher\n\n\nI had eighteen upon hundred for Maths in sec two\n\n\nSo when the teacher was teaching I would draw cartoons and then\nshe'll come to me and stare at me and I looked at her in defiance\n\n\nI remember breaking down in tears but when when I was in sec four\nI had this teacher you know who is so fierce\n\n\nEvery time he comes in he looks at a vulture you know you know\nthose black frame old fashion type\n\n\nThen he will put his hand behind\n\n<$A> \n\nOh that sounds like the uh\n\n<$B> \n\nHave you done have you done your homework\n\n\nIt is like you what more work that kind\n\n<$A> \n\nOld fashion right\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nBut I think nowadays I think our students are not afraid of\nus at all anymore\n\n\nNo no\n\n<$B> \n\nBut mine are you know because when I go to class it's like I\nam leading a choir leading a choir or an orchestra\n\n\nWhen I go to class I expect absolute silence there\n\n\nGood morning class\n\n\nDon't know how I do that\n\n\nThen they

{"text": "<$A> \n\nI think at present the subject I like most is uh I think EL 407\n\n<$B> \n\n407\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n\nIt's uhm I mean it's education and something that I find to be very\npractical especially for next line because I'm thinking to going to teaching\n\n\nAnd I don't know I mean I I like the lecturer's style of teaching\n\n\nHis his firstly he speaks quite he's able uh I'm able to follow it\nsystematically and I'm I'm able to you know take down notes easily easily\nalso\n\n\nI mean and uh I don't know why I mean he is quite interesting in a\nway also and I can I'm able to grasp the concept\n\n\nI'm okay\n\n\nWhat about yourself I mean what do you like\n\n<$B> \n\nFor me I like I like models best\n\n\n402 because I I think it's very interesting because there's there's\nthree different theories and basically we sort of put into practice what we\nhave for the past three years which is grammatically analysis\n\n\nAnd it's more in depth sort of analysis so to do that what what\nI've learnt for three years is more worthwhile in doing that course\n\n\nAnd personally I like narrative structures\n\n\nI think that's very interesting uh\n\n<$A> \n\nI was I was a little bit worried about narrative structure\n\n\nI mean am I uhm am I how should I say\n\n\nSomething like uhm okay so far what I've done in a in the narrative\nstructure lectures right I think sort of anything from 305 because I never\nbeen taken 305 so my worry is there you see\n\n<$B> \n\nI guess at at the moment we we haven't done anything on 305\n\n\nUh but basically a very I think it's a very subjective course\n\n\nSo whatever your point of view whatever you feel as long as you can\njustify you should get be able to get a good grade\n\n\nWhat do you feel about uh I mean Lexicology and Semantics\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't quite like Semantics and Lexicology for one point\nbecause the lecturer seems to seem the lecturer seems to be very uhm\ndisorganised\n\n\nAnd uh I mean I don't know it's like okay like for example\nSemantics uhm it's like as if it's not really prepared you see so and so\nbecause of that it's not very structured\n\n\nAnything can be discussed during the seminar so I'm not very used\nto such lecturer\n\n\nBasically I'll be I'm quite at a loss as to what is important and\nwhat is not\n\n\nAnd uh for Lexicography it's the same thing ya because it's very\nfunny to go into a lecture to a seminar and then come out and and have this\nuhm sense that maybe I I mean come out with little so I don't know if that's\nthe essence of it\n\n\nI mean uhm he spoke a lot you see but then the lesson seems to be\nvery little so I don't know if that's what it is uh whether those are the\nmain point or whether I've lost a lot of thing you know\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's about how I feel\n\n\nI basically I feel that Lexicology is just you and there there will\nnot be much knowledge being past and a lot of practice and a lot of skill\n\n\nAnd because it depends on intuition I I think that some people will\ndo better regardless whether they read more or less than other people\n\n<$A> \n\nI've not very good intuitions\n\n<$B> \n\nI mean certain things I just don't see the way the lecturer\nsees\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n\nDo you watch uh anyway do you watch watch It\n\n\nI mean the show It\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nOh you didn't\n\n\nOh I mean you watch TV <unclear> word </unclear> ya\n\n\nDo you watch TV I mean\n\n<$B> \n\nSometimes I I mainly watch I like to watch Laser Disc\n\n<$A> \n\nLaser Disc\n\n\nOh you have Laser Disc\n\n<$B> \n\nYes so we we me and wife we always borrow things that both of\nus are interested in\n\n\nUsually the TV has things that one of us\n\n<$A> \n\nOh so what what do you usually do you watch I mean\n\n<$B> \n\nShows like My Fair Lady The Sound of Music\n\n\nOn Laser Disc it's very clear\n\n<$A> \n\nHow much is it a text\n\n<$B> \n\nI mean to you mean a recorder or the renting\n\n<$A> \n\nYou mean you got a recorder\n\n<$B> \n\nYou need a recorder\n\n<$A> \n\nYou have a recorder\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't I'm using my <unclear> word </unclear> when I stay at\nmy friend's house so I'm using his recorder\n\n<$A> \n\nHow much is the disc I mean the rental\n\n<$B> \n\nRental is very cheap\n\n\nNormal video tapes about four to five dollars\n\n\nLaser Disc cost about four dollars\n\n\nCan if you rent three discs and above you can have it for one week\nand and the thing is it's good as you can just search the part that you want\nto see because the whole story is broken up into a few segments\n\n\nAnd for certain Laser Disc for Draculla and and you can choose the\nending that you want\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo they will they will actually this side b at the end right\n\n\nThey will have ending A ending B and you select your own\n\n<$A> \n\nOh that means ah the the show is then you mean\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat\n\n<$A> \n\nI mean you mean the Dracula as in Best of the Dracula\n\n<$B> \n\nAh the recent one\n\n<$A> \n\nThere are three different endings\n\n<$B> \n\nYes because they sometimes the director takes a few cuts\n\n\nThen he he picks the best one\n\n\nHe goes according to audience's liking\n\n<$A> \n\nOh I see\n\n<$B> \n\nSo you get to play director sometimes\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo it's very fun know you know what I mean\n\n\nYou choose no shiok then you just change\n\n<$A> \n\nSo what you I mean can you can only change the ending\n\n\nCan you change anything else\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> of it\n\n<$A> \n\nNo only the ending\n\n<$B> \n\nI mean main things are there\n\n\nSometime they give you a a a a lot of extra footages like N Gs uh\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat's N Gs\n\n<$B> \n\nN g is like not good scenes\n\n\nSo when the uh actors laugh or they forgot their lines\n\n<$A> \n\nOh I see\n\n<$B> \n\nOr when their room drops down\n\n<$A> \n\nOh the telephone\n\n<$B> \n\nI think ignore it\n\n<$A> \n\nI think we should ya I think so lah\n\n<$B> \n\nI mean anyway it's not our room\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's not our room\n\n<$B> \n\nActually it's quite a good investment your family can see\n\n<$A> \n\nMy mom actually thought about that thing sort of a setting up\na home theatre\n\n\nYa but then uhm we're thinking that it's no point because we live\nin a three-room flat\n\n\nWhatever we do I mean you know you you need a very big house to\nhave something like that a special room for this and then otherwise it will\nbe it sorts of defeat the purpose because also you get karaoke and all that\nright\n\n<$B> \n\nYa actually it doesn't know because a simple set cost about\ntwo three two to three thousand\n\n\nI mean about thousand over a TV thousand over for a Laser Disc and\nI I find that's the one that my friend has\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy why you have you already have a TV must you get another I\nmean a new TV\n\n<$B> \n\nUh you you need not have to if your TV is what they good\nenough or functional enough because Laser Disc offer a lot of uh options like\nsurround sound stereophonic sound effect\n\n<$A> \n\nOh I see\n\n<$B> \n\nIf you don't have a good TV with very good speakers the joy\nis like half gone\n\n\nYou get very clear image but not not clear sound\n\n<$A> \n\nOh I see\n\n\nYes well don't know\n\n\nI mean anyway the money has gotten into making cabinets room\ncabinets\n\n<$B> \n\nActually that's more functional\n\n<$A> \n\nYa well\n\n<$B> \n\nSo will you be attending the talk this uh coming Tuesday\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I will be I mean the ya\n\n\nI mean I was looking through\n\n<$B> \n\nIt seems that they they place a lot of emphasis on the\nteaching\n\n<$A> \n\nYa actually it's quite a fix of set compared to the other one\n\n\nThe other one is more demanding in terms of its direction\n\n\nUh but the teaching one is more demanding in the actual course\n\n<$B> \n\nIt seems that you fail the teaching you fail the whole course\n\n<$A> \n\nYa and the the worry is that I mean you got to go and you got\nfor practical uhm experience right you got to go and teach in the primary\nschools or secondary schools in England\n\n\nThat was uhm this sorts of you know like make make me makes me\nwonder uhm\n\n\nI mean when you teach the school in England then how I mean like\nour English is not their their English ya\n\n\nI mean will they be able to accept\n\n\nMost probably not and then how when it comes to such things\n\n<$B> \n\nBut will will that deter you from applying\n\n<$A> \n\nI think I'll just go and try and not think too much about it\n\n<$B> \n\nYa ya that's <unclear> word </unclear> that's how I'm going\nto do too\n\n<$A> \n\nI guess just to leave at least leave the options open you\nknow\n\n<$B> \n\nBut do you think it'll be more recognised if you come back as\noverseas scholar\n\n<$A> \n\nThat's what I thought yep see\n\n\nYa and I mean\n\n<$B> \n\nShould be right logically\n\n<$A> \n\nThere's always been my dream to go to another country whether\nI'm going before to just study not for uh you know like a major course but\njust for a year course\n\n\nJust see what's it's all about especially and what's like to study\nabroad\n\n<$B> \n\nSo would you like to teach in a secondary or JC\n\n<$A> \n\nI think I'll like to teach in secondary\n\n\nUhm firstly it's because you know like during college time I find\nthat the principals are quite idiosyncratic and very very demanding because\nof the A level you see and there are not many junior college here\n\n\nAnd then uhm I find that teaching in a secondary school might be\nmore personal\n\n\nYou can do it at a more personal level and uh don't know I'm\nfinding I don't know I think I prefer to teach at N level than at JC\n\n<$B> \n\nWill you prefer an all guys school\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm ya\n\n<$B> \n\nAn any reasons\n\n<$A> \n\nAny reasons ha\n\n\nI don't know either that or or or co-ed\n\n\nUhm better not all girl school especially the girls will bully the\nguys\n\n\nAre you still are you thinking of teaching I mean at all\n\n<$B> \n\nI I don't know\n\n\nI'm I'm more thinking of a more stable job\n\n<$A> \n\nTeaching is not stable\n\n<$B> \n\nActually I don't know\n\n\nI may leave because of my this idiosyncrasies\n\n\nI don't think I can\n\n\nI mean put in a gross gross way endure thirty years of teaching\n\n\nPersonally I I would like the job where I I could climb I mean\n\n\nAnd teaching even though you can climb I guess takes many years\nten years\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's more uh like something you love to do forever\n\n<$B> \n\nRather than be ambitious and <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's different\n\n\nI guess it's like how what you want to do but teaching is like a\nvocation\n\n<$B> \n\nI was thinking of the Police Force\n\n<$A> \n\nPolice Force\n\n<$B> \n\nBut my wife is against it\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause it's quite dangerous right\n\n\nI think it's more dangerous than the army\n\n\nI find that uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nWar is less real\n\n<$A> \n\nYa and you don't do that much because of you know like\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nPolice is like really you know what I mean you are really in fore\nfront\n\n<$B> \n\nOr another thing would be I hope to go and study some more\n\n\nProbably come back and teach in a higher higher institution\n\n\nBut that doesn't seem very likely\n\n<$A> \n\nOh then you'll never know right\n\n<$B> \n\nDoctor Peter Ong\n\n\nBut even though you have have the money you even though you have\nthe qualifications you may not have the money\n\n\nGet good results and may not have money to go\n\n<$A> \n\nBut some of them like that means let's say you do\n\n\nOkay let's say you get a very good honours that means you will\ncontinue with the masters\n\n<$B> \n\nI would rather go abroad\n\n<$A> \n\nAbroad\n\n\nIt all depends\n\n\nI mean then what your finance ah \n\n\nIf lets say there is this scholarship will you do it on your own\nfinance\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't think I can't I I don't think I can", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

\n\nThat day Elaine tried to put for me\n\n\nThen it you know because the cover right it covers up to a certain\nextent and then it covers the the button because mine has got a press stud\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nSo you cannot cannot close the file if you put the cover on\ntop because the cover will cover over the press stud\n\n<$A> \n\nYa but why don't you do it at the at the bottom lor\n\n<$B> \n\nOnly for the bottom then you might as well just laminate it\nright\n\n\nThat means just the bottom\n\n\nI mean just the back of the file only has one\n\n<$A> \n\nOh I see what you mean\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know because the thing has a flap right so when it covers\nthe thing it there is a press stud right\n\n<$A> \n\nOh you are talking about put putting post cards or pictures\nthere is it\n\n<$B> \n\nMy file can't at all because of the weird shape of the file\n\n<$A> \n\nCan nah because you see you have uhm right is a file then you\nfold it down right\n\n<$B> \n\nYa ya\n\n<$A> \n\nThen you can you can still this space here what for your\npictures\n\n<$B> \n\nThat is where my Garfield and V C F sticker is lor\n\n<$A> \n\nOh that that means you can't put anymore lah\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat what about at the back\n\n<$B> \n\nAt the back nice\n\n<$A> \n\nEmpty\n\n\nFine\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause you see I if I put it at the back I need to cover it\nso I will it will get very dirty\n\n<$A> \n\nOh so you oh now you have only laminated your front is it\n\n<$B> \n\nI never even laminated the front\n\n\nWhat I did I just put a sticker and sticker are naturally laminated\nalready\n\n\nI had the one with Garfield and the green coloured ode the one that\nLinda was saying\n\n\nYou know then the V C F sticker I just wanted to cover the National\nUniversity of

that\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy you go and buy such difficult\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I like I am I'm used to that type of file you know\n\n\nSince J C I had this the the one with the flap\n\n<$A> \n\nThat is why I hate the flap type\n\n\nYou know why\n\n\nYou can't put a lot of things in there\n\n\nBecause of then button once you if you stack it up real high right\nyou can't close\n\n<$B> \n\nYa but isn't it the same with the others\n\n<$A> \n\nNo\n\n\nThe ring file we can put at least about this thick you know the\nstack of papers or whatever just put it there and it can still hold on to it\n\n<$B> \n\nBut it drops off right\n\n<$A> \n\nYa ya lah\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause people like me need the covering that flap right as\nlong as the flap can close ha\n\n\nI guaran I can guarantee that the the paper won't fall down you\nsee\n\n\nSo I need that in case it has happened to me so many times already\nin the bus right and then you hold the file like that in this\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nYa so embarrassing\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know what my friend does\n\n\nShe has you know the ordinary ring file you have this thing the\n\n<$B> \n\nThe clip\n\n<$A> \n\nYa the clip here right\n\n\nThen you have the rings here right and here is where you always\nput your papers and sometimes when your clip is too when when too many papers\nto clip you can't clip everything there right\n\n\nSo what she does is that she puts the rest of the papers other\nside and she buys those thick clips\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd she clips it there\n\n<$B> \n\nOh ya I see what you mean\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know what I mean\n\n<$B> \n\nOh no wonder a lot of people have those clips on their files\n\n<$A> \n\nOn their files quite useful ha\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I still cannot lah\n\n\nI am still not used to it\n\n\nI am still very used to that old type\n\n<$A> \n\nHe's got so many posters in his room\n\n<$B> \n\nLes Miserables that L very nice\n\n<$A> \n\nAye I know\n\n\nAre you going to watch\n\n<$B> \n\nCannot lah so expensive a hundred over right for one ticket\n\n<$A> \n\nFor what\n\n\nThe tickets are one two six but that is only for American Express\ncard holders\n\n\nI think there are cheaper ones you know\n\n<$B> \n\nMy friend said she could cater for seventy you know because\neither they bought in bulk or something like that\n\n<$A> \n\nActually you can\n\n\nI think the cheapest is seventy but uhm for for American card\nholders when they send you the forms right I think they charge you one two\nsix\n\n<$B> \n\nNo because they said the tickets are seventy right and those\nfor seventy dollars you are getting the front row seats\n\n<$A> \n\nSince when\n\n\nHow\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know how she do it lah\n\n\nShe I think they bought in bulk a lot a lot so then they were\ntrying to get rid of it seventy\n\n<$A> \n\nSo is she trying to rid of it now\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know\n\n\nKareen Chow also wants me to go and fine out\n\n<$A> \n\nCan can can can\n\n<$B> \n\nMaybe I will find out for you lah whether the thing is\n\n<$A> \n\nIs Lin is Linda going\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't think Linda's going\n\n\nShe didn't say anything\n\n<$A> \n\nThen how come she she's got the pamphlet there\n\n<$B> \n\nShe can get pamphlet without buying the ticket what\n\n<$A> \n\nBut usually you don't like put it right in at the top of your\nbook you know without wanting to go\n\n<$B> \n\nActually I want to go

well\n\n\nAnd there's a huge TV room downstairs with VCR equipment\n\n<$B> \n\nIt is uhm well equipped as Bayshore\n\n\nThen Bayshore is like that isn't it\n\n<$A> \n\nBut I don't think Bayshore has got the steam and sauna and\ndon't have\n\n<$B> \n\nNo no no no classes and ya\n\n<$A> \n\nThey don't have the TV room I'm sure\n\n<$B> \n\nYa I don't think they have a TV but uhm sounds\n\n<$A> \n\nI mean they have it's like divided by the three\n\n\nBut I didn't use the pool the last time it was cold\n\n\nBut I use I I did use the weights room\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd what's the weather gonna be like in San Francisco\n\n<$A> \n\nDuring this time of the year it's just going to be cool\n\n<$B> \n\nCool\n\n<$A> \n\nYes something like I don't know\n\n<$B> \n\nThe same as London\n\n<$A> \n\nTwenties I think probably twenty\n\n<$B> \n\nTwenties is not cool it's hot\n\n<$A> \n\nUsually if there if in the evening it gets down to about\nfourteen to sixteen\n\n\nIt's jacket time right\n\n\nIt's quite nice\n\n\nI like the weather in San Francisco\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay because uhm okay I I mean I'm just gonna try to tie this\nup right because my exams finish on the the weekend ending tenth of August\naround then I think\n\n<$A> \n\nTenth of August so soon ah\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nNo\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uh I mean tenth of September\n\n\nSorry\n\n\nYa\n\n\nAre you gonna be still be there after that\n\n<$A> \n\nNo I'm gonna be school already\n\n<$B> \n\nOh okay so there's no point me going then\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay unless you want to go and then come down to Arizona lor\n\n\nBut I don't know what the whole schedule is like\n\n\nI don't even know what's this gonna be like\n\n\nI don't know how things are going to be like so it's quite lay\nchay\n\n\nCome another time lah\n\n<$B> \n\nYa I probably will lah because uh when I start working I\nprobably will have my own money and then I won't be bothered by my parents\nand all that I suppose\n\n<$A> \n\nSee how lor\n\n<$B> \n\nSpend is enough I mean last night all the shelling I got from\nthem\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't see why you should be so bothered about the stupid\nthing at all\n\n\nI mean you know whoever gives it to you it's not their problem is\nit\n\n\nWhy are they so suspicious for anyway\n\n<$B> \n\nThey are so suspicious of me is because my recent spate of\nevents you see\n\n<$A> \n\nYou're going out late\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause I'm chalking up bills okay\n\n<$A> \n\nHere or there\n\n<$B> \n\nOver in London right chalking up bills\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd oh they're the ones who pay\n\n<$B> \n\nThen overdraft ya\n\n<$A> \n\nYou you got overdraft facility meh\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nStudents have overdraft facilities there\n\n<$A> \n\nVery very clever oh you\n\n<$B> \n\nHa\n\n<$A> \n\nHow much overdraft have you got\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uh five hundred over pound overdraft\n\n\nAll students get it\n\n<$A> \n\nBut how how come they they can find out about it\n\n<$B> \n\nI have to tell them I owe me you some money\n\n<$A> \n\nSo you very clever lor you\n\n\nAnd then is it because of that person\n\n<$B> \n\nBasically I was spending because you know why I had dinners\nout lunch out dinners out\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd because of that person right\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy why because of that person\n\n<$A> \n\nBut I mean usually you wouldn't right unless don't you cook\n\n\nI thought you cook\n\n<$B> \n\nI used to cook a lot right but the thing was it it didn't\nsound feasible because uhm you'll be out right and it takes you hours to get\ntakes you an hour to get back all right\n\n\nAnd you then you got to do the shopping\n\n\nThen you got to cook\n\n\nBy the time you finished eating it's about what\n\n\nTen-thirty\n\n<$A> \n\nDon't you like I don't know uhm buy just once a week enough\ngroceries to last you for the week and then when before you go out just take\nthings out of the freezer and put it in the fridge to thaw and then come back\njust pick up or even manu ma ma marinate it the night before or something and\nleave it in there\n\n<$B> \n\nI I know but but the thing is it's always took too much time\nyou see\n\n<$A> \n\nAiyah I really don't know lah\n\n\nI probably will have to start cooking\n\n\nI don't think I want to eat out too much because I'm kind of\nlooking forward to to to the fact that I'll be totally responsible for my own\ndiet\n\n\nThen I can sort of eat things I want to eat\n\n\nThe only thing\n\n<$B> \n\nWell even even if you eat out you can always uhm uhm control\nthe things you eat because uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nNot necessarily\n\n<$B> \n\nOver over in <unclear> word </unclear> over in London you\nknow things places like uh Burger King and McDonalds they had salads you know\n\n<$A> \n\nYa lah but I may not going to go all the way there to have\nfast food\n\n\nI don't even have fast food here in Singapore\n\n<$B> \n\nWell ya but then\n\n<$A> \n\nNo I'm thinking of like I don't know lah probably\n\n\nSee how see how I won't do it\n\n\nI know I know probably now I'm gonna to talk about it right when I\nget I'm not gonna do anything wait eat out all the time\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause you know I'm I'm sure you you'll find that it's so\ndifficult to juggle time\n\n\nBecause you firstly you got to iron clothes you got to laundry\nyour clothes\n\n<$A> \n\nNo I'm not going to iron I think\n\n\nJust look grungy lor look grungy all the time\n\n<$B> \n\nNo hey you got to study as well\n\n\nYou got to go for your lessons and I think you got to go shopping\nfor food\n\n\nThere's lots of things you'll be doing and you just don't have\nthat many hours\n\n<$A> \n\nIs it\n\n<$B> \n\nUnless all right you are living on campus itself\n\n<$A> \n\nI'm living near campus\n\n<$B> \n\nWell if you are living near campus okay\n\n\nBut I wasn't living near campus\n\n\nIt took me about half an hour to reach college\n\n<$A> \n\nOh mine mine is just three minutes walking time\n\n<$B> \n\nYou see so it's different\n\n\nIt's not like when I was in college if I could cook all the time\nbecause you know it was I was just five minutes walk from college you see\n\n\nKnow what I mean\n\n<$A> \n\nAiyah see how see how\n\n\nDon't know what my schedule is gonna be like\n\n<$B> \n\nSo when I was in London this year it was like it was too\npacked you see\n\n\nThe time was too much\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay okay even though it's like quite suspicious but why why\nokay if you are getting money from some shouldn't they be happy about it that\nyou're not asking money from them\n\n<$B> \n\nNo because they think I've been up to no good recently you\nsee\n\n\nThey think I'm being kept actually\n\n<$A> \n\nReally ah\n\n\nThat's quite that's quite an accomplishment what\n\n\nDon't you think so\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I would think so but they don't think so obviously I\nmean\n\n\nAiyah so they they question me recently about you know those thing\n\n\nMy my sis question me recently why aren't I coming back you know\nbecause is it because of someone and so or or is it because of you know what\nand what I just told you it's because of the freedom I get over there which\nis true\n\n<$A> \n\nNo why have you not been coming home in in Singapore \n\n<$B> \n\nNo no because I want to stay there to stu uh work you see\n\n<$A> \n\nOh they don't want\n\n\nOh I see\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd they're getting very suspicious you see\n\n<$A> \n\nAiyah really but it's your life you know\n\n\nUltimately where you gonna end up it's isn't it I mean you got to\nlive your life what\n\n<$B> \n\nTrue that's but that's the difference between your family\nand my family upbringing you see\n\n<$A> \n\nI mean I know my parents were sort of talk talking about me\neventually but it seems somehow they sort of know that it's it's there is\ndistinct possibility you're coming down probably not be coming back not so\nsoon anyway lah\n\n\nYou know what I mean", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nWhat did you what did you think about it\n\n<$B> \n\nI think I never expected it to happen you know because uh I\nalways thought to myself that the MRT was perfectly safe and all that\n\n\nBut I was so surprised to hear that that you know it actually\ncrashed okay\n\n\nAnd there's a good thing that it crashed at the station and one of\nthe trains was stationary\n\n<$A> \n\nStationary\n\n\nThat's right but that shouldn't happen if the train is stationary\n\n\nWhy should the uh moving train you know collide into\n\n<$B> \n\nI think the time-table must have got mixed up\n\n\nMaybe one train was the the the the first train was slower and\nsecond train was faster you know so somehow or rather <unclear> word\n</unclear> happen\n\n\n'Cause it's quite frequent right the MRT\n\n<$A> \n\nYes I think in morning it's about three minutes intervals or\nsomething\n\n<$B> \n\nEnough to crash <unclear> word </unclear> probably\n\n<$A> \n\nSo Boon did you take the MRT to work I mean to to\n\n<$B> \n\nI stay at Eusoff College and there's a shuttle bus service\n\n<$A> \n\nI see I see\n\n\nWell I don't take the MRT I take the bus so but I take the MRT home\n\n<$B> \n\nOh now you be with\n\n<$A> \n\nSo hopefully it it will resume its service when at about five\no'clock\n\n<$B> \n\nYou think people will lose faith in the MRT now that this has\nhappened\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't think so I think I think it there must be some some\nreason behind colli collision\n\n\nIt cannot happen just all of a sudden like\n\n<$B> \n\nProbably there will be a big investigation like <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nI'm sure there will\n\n<$B> \n\nWhen the the cable-car actually came down at Sentosa there was\nthis big in inquest right ya\n\n\nSo probably the same is gonna happen now\n\n<$A> \n\nYes yes but luckily it was I mean one of the train was\nstationary\n\n\nI'm sure the the impact of collision may not have been very bad\n\n<$B> \n\nProbably many of the people on on the train were students at\nNUS because it happened at Clementi in the morning you know\n\n<$A> \n\nI suppose\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nBut then the the the train was suppose to be heading towards\nJurong\n\n<$B> \n\nYa exactly\n\n<$A> \n\nSo so probably more workers rather than students\n\n<$B> \n\nBut it stopped at Clementi you see so\n\n\nThat means the students haven't got down yet so probably\n\n<$A> \n\nOh do they normally go to Clementi Station\n\n<$B> \n\nYa many many students go to Clementi especially if they're\nfrom Arts or from Engineering right\n\n<$A> \n\nI see I see\n\n<$B> \n\nYa so probably lot of NUS students involve in that crash there\n\n<$A> \n\nDo you know they're gonna have it on TV at three o'clock this\nafternoon\n\n<$B> \n\nYou mean it has become a some like some celebrity\n\n<$A> \n\nNot cele <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nI think they they they they promise a a kind of a report on TV\n\n\nSo at three o'clock this afternoon there'll be there'll be two\ntelecast one on channel eight and one on channel five\n\n\nSo it's it's almost three o'clock now\n\n\nMaybe we can get hold of if we can get hold of a TV we can listen\nin and see what's what has what actually happen this morning\n\n<$B> \n\nRight right\n\n<$A> \n\nPriscilla do you play any sports\n\n<$B> \n\nAh ya I I play squash and right now I'm trying to learn tennis\nwith a friend of mine who is teaching me\n\n<$A> \n\nOh how how often do you play\n\n<$B> \n\nTennis\n\n<$A> \n\nTennis\n\n<$B> \n\nUh not very often\n\n\nWhen he's free uh then he'll teach me you see so uh\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay what about squash\n\n\nDo you play squash very often\n\n<$B> \n\nOh now I don't\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's hard to get hold of a partner to play\n\n<$B> \n\nYa partner who's about the same level as you not too bad not\ntoo good you know that sort of thing\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat about facilities\n\n<$B> \n\nUh I try to go over to IE uh rather College of Physical\nEducation because it's just across the road from where I stay\n\n<$A> \n\nEusoff College\n\n<$B> \n\nEusoff college ya\n\n<$A> \n\nDo you have to pay to get in there\n\n<$B> \n\nUnfortunately yes but usually we can also you know just go\nthere if there's nobody using\n\n\nIt's it's quite alright ya\n\n<$A> \n\nAre are you very good at squash\n\n<$B> \n\nUh I'm not on the squash ladder or anything but uh\n\n<$A> \n\nJust recreational play\n\n<$B> \n\nYa just recreational play\n\n\nWhat about yourself Doctor Chui\n\n<$A> \n\nI I don't play any\n\n\nI I do I used to play tennis and and the squash as well but because\nit's difficult it's difficult to find a partner who is who who's on the same\nlevel as you\n\n\nIn in the case of tennis you find that if if you get a very good\nplayer you you find that you you picking up balls most of the time\n\n\nSo now I I I I in my spare time I run a lot jogging and so on\n\n\nI'm still thinking considering whether I should participate in the\nend of year marathon\n\n<$B> \n\nOh the one up Mount Kinabalu is it\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no no no it\n\n\nThis is organised by Mobil the annual marathon Singapore marathon\n\n<$B> \n\nTwenty-three K\n\n<$A> \n\nForty-six kilometres\n\n<$B> \n\nOh okay\n\n<$A> \n\nSo I'm still considering very hard whether I should put in the\nthe registration form\n\n<$B> \n\nBut have you actually run such a distance before\n\n<$A> \n\nI have done a half marathon uh a few years ago\n\n\nThat's about twenty-three or thirteen miles\n\n<$B> \n\nThirteen miles miles\n\n<$A> \n\nThirteen miles\n\n\nThat wasn't too bad\n\n<$B> \n\nYou mean you managed you did not walk\n\n<$A> \n\nI did not walk yes\n\n\nI I did run all the way didn't have to walk at all\n\n<$B> \n\nAny ranking\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no just a like you uh uh like you I'm just a recreational\nrunner so\n\n<$B> \n\nUh you don't play any other racket games at all\n\n<$A> \n\nNot so much racket games no\n\n<$B> \n\nJust running only\n\n<$A> \n\nJust mainly running\n\n<$B> \n\nAh how about swimming\n\n<$A> \n\nSwimming occasionally you know when when I when I uh when\nit's too hot then I just think I'll just go for a dip\n\n<$B> \n\nNot not so much like a serious you know\n\n<$A> \n\nNo I don't swim laps so\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay what what styles do you swim\n\n<$A> \n\nWell breast-strokes or or free-style\n\n\nWell I don't I I won't consider that really very serious swimming\n\n\nIt's just like taking a dip\n\n<$B> \n\nTaking a dip right\n\n\nOkay I'm I'm a pretty serious swimmer I would say\n\n<$A> \n\nOh really\n\n<$B> \n\nI mean if I go into the pool I would like do laps you know\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd how many laps do you do\n\n<$B> \n\nUh maybe twenty\n\n<$A> \n\nTwenty laps\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nThat's very good\n\n\nFree-style twenty laps\n\n<$B> \n\nNo uh breast-stroke\n\n\nBut it's difficult to actually swim in pools because there are so\nmany people there people keep banging into you\n\n<$A> \n\nThat's right that's right\n\n<$B> \n\nYa so it's not very easy to actually swim laps\n\n<$A> \n\nI used to swim swim laps too but I find it uh uh like you say\nsometimes it's very crowded\n\n<$B> \n\nYa that's right it is very crowded\n\n<$A> \n\nIn the pool\n\n<$B> \n\nBut it's it's so nice to actually run and then swim you know\n\n\nI don't whether you tried that before you you maybe you run about\n\n\nI don't know how many K\n\n\nI I run about two K then I'll go back change and go down for a for\na swim\n\n<$A> \n\nFor a dip\n\n<$B> \n\nYa it's really refreshing\n\n<$A> \n\nHave you considered the biathlon\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n\nAs I said I ought\n\n<$A> \n\nYou can swim and run\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I think that swimming is usually done in the sea right\n\n\nThe triathlon\n\n<$A> \n\nYa but there there there are different ways of I think some\nsome organisations have the swim in swimming pools\n\n\nAnd they have done that before\n\n<$B> \n\nOh I see I object to swimming in the sea because uh I don't\nthink it's very safe Many accidents have happened in Singapore and uh\noverseas as well\n\n<$A> \n\nI suppose if you're a strong swimmer you don't have to worry\nabout that\n\n<$B> \n\nI'm a swimming pool swimmer not a not a sea swimmer\n\n<$A> \n\nThat's very that's very aiyah I understand what you meant\n\n\nIt's very different swimming in the pool and swimming in the sea\nbecause in the sea they've got currents and wave and all these stuff\n\n\nSo it it can really put you off\n\n<$B> \n\nYa true\n\n\nAnyway it's just for fun lah\n\n\nSwimming and running and all these it's just for fun not not not\nvery serious about it actually ya\n\n\nI I also actually teach aerobics presently\n\n<$A> \n\nOh do you\n\n<$B> \n\nYa ya ya\n\n<$A> \n\nWhere do you do that\n\n<$B> \n\nIn Eusoff College\n\n\nI'm actually taking a class uh once a week\n\n<$A> \n\nOnce a week and what kind of aerobics do you do high impact\nlow impact step\n\n<$B> \n\nI'm trying to teach them high impact but uh the they are not\nthat very fit right now but I think they will improve with time\n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n\nAre you certified\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nYou're not\n\n<$B> \n\nI'm not but I know I know how to do Jane Fonda's complete\nworkout quite well with my eyes closed\n\n\nPut it that way ya\n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause I have been watching the video and doing it for about\nmore than a year\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd I used to take classes in NUS as well as outside\n\n<$A> \n\nOh do you\n\n<$B> \n\nYa I used to so now I'm trying to teach them as a favour\n\n\nActually not because I I'm committed to it but as a favour because\nthey want to learn\n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n\nI used to take a a few aerobic classes myself too\n\n<$B> \n\nOh I see\n\n\nWhere where about did you\n\n<$A> \n\nWell I I I've join this uh club outside\n\n<$B> \n\nSo what type of aerobics\n\n<$A> \n\nOh well all sorts low-high high-low\n\n<$B> \n\nStep\n\n<$A> \n\nStep as well\n\n\nStep is is pretty fun\n\n<$B> \n\nYa that's what I heard but I don't\n\n<$A> \n\nHave you tried that\n\n<$B> \n\nNo I haven't tried it because they they only teach it outside\n\n<$A> \n\nThey don't they don't have it in NUS\n\n<$B> \n\nIn NUS no\n\n\nI mean I stop going to the rhythmics club\n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n<$B> \n\nYa but the NUS uh uh aerobics is actually uh ya quite is\nquite tough\n\n\nYou know the regiment\n\n<$A> \n\nIs is this conducted by students or instructed from outside\n\n<$B> \n\nStudents\n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n<$B> \n\nYa and uh but it's not bad you know\n\n\nA lot of guys come as well and\n\n<$A> \n\nReally\n\n<$B> \n\nYa and you can see them panting and puffing as well so that I\nknow that I don't feel guilty when I do that then\n\n<$A> \n\nActually step is quite fun but when I still remember very\nfirst step class and uh it's not that easy initially because you you you\nreally have to concentrate on what the instructress's doing\n\n\nAnd it it it has to be you cannot think too much you just have to\ndo it\n\n\nYou step up and down the the bench and you you cannot concentrate\n\n\nI mean you cannot really uh if you if you try to think too much\nyou you you get confused and you can't follow the class anymore\n\n\nSo it it depends very much on on your spontaneity so you just have\nto do it\n\n<$B> \n\nBut it's really fun\n\n<$A> \n\nIt it it it's really fun and uh it can be very high intensity\ntoo\n\n\nYou can really pant a lot\n\n\nAnd it depends on how many steps you take\n\n\nIf you if you you can for beginners you start with just one bench\none step then you promote you progress on to two steps\n\n<$B> \n\nOn the other hand Jane Fonda's workout it's it's really fun\nbecause uh it's it's a dance workout as well ya\n\n\nSo it's like that there's cha cha there rock n' roll and uh\nthere's country uh so it's it's really interesting Scottish dance and all\nthat\n\n<$A> \n\nReally Scottish\n\n\nBut I've seen a programme I've seen a video tape once but probably\nit's a different one different tape\n\n\nI I I if I've not mistaken she has a few tapes\n\n<$B> \n\nShe does\n\n\nI think there's a there's one which is quite interesting\n\n\nThe lean routine\n\n\nUh it also involving like modern jazz ballet you see \n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n<$B> \n\nQuite interesting actually\n\n<$A> \n\nBut I suppose that's more for girls\n\n\nThe guys will not\n\n<$B> \n\nThey usually have guys in the video as well", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ee33ceac-f4b2-41fc-bc85-76ece9d0c983", "added":

me to make a copy for the rest of them and then he\ndidn't keep a copy for himself\n\n<$B> \n\nYa ah\n\n<$A> \n\nSo today ah I just joking said you know\n\n\nNo no he said he ask me uh where is your table ah I've been\nwaiting for very long\n\n\nThe thing's that I showed it to you what at a meeting that day\n\n\nHe say ya but I want a copy for myself\n\n\nThen I was wondering why you took so long\n\n\nSo I said but all of us thought you didn't want to keep a copy you\nknow\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nThen he say then I I said as I was quite hurt that after I\nput in so much effort you don't want a copy\n\n\nThen he said oh no no no no no don't misunderstand I want it\n\n\nThen he said oh next time if you clear our set you must tell me\nyou know\n\n\nAye he has a lot of experience leh\n\n\nYou know he was with the main branch leh for one year as a cadet\nofficer then subsequently he join Bedok branch as second officer\n\n\nSecond officer is something like assistant manager\n\n<$B> \n\nAh ha\n\n<$A> \n\nThen after he was posted to a few other branches to set up\nnew branches like World Trade Centre\n\n\nWorld Trade Centre is one of highest profit-making branches\n\n\nSo eventually they posted him back to retail banking head office\nah to clear up the mess\n\n\nHe said everywhere he went ah\n\n<$B> \n\nIs the best\n\n<$A> \n\nIs a new challenge and he he feels very slippery one you know\nbut he still made it and he just have to do it you know\n\n\nSo he said actually a lot of thing he's not very happy with it\n\n\nHe he just bear with them\n\n<$B> \n\nLike having\n\n<$A> \n\nHe just have to live with it\n\n<$B> \n\nHaving to start from so many ya\n\n\nI think after you have done well increases your confidence and you\ndon't feel wah you know jumpy and all that\n\n\nThat's why in the US ah there are lot of people there're special\nspecialise in turn around situation\n\n\nThey told me you know something is wrong then they go in they are\ncompany doctor or or\n\n\nWhen the company is doing well and all that ah wah they got no\nrole for themselves ah\n\n\nThey're good in problem solving but they're not good in uh you\nknow planning ahead improving on what is a really good you know\n\n<$A> \n\nOh we have too many fruits you know\n\n\nAye the nectarines are not nice ah\n\n\nHow ah so many left\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't mind eating them but I can't finish\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's quite big\n\n\nWhich one is it\n\n<$B> \n\nDon't know sufficient or not\n\n<$A> \n\nHa\n\n<$B> \n\nThis luncheon meat\n\n<$A> \n\nAye must buy this one nah the oyster sauce\n\n<$B> \n\nYou want me to cut up more\n\n<$A> \n\nOh I think enough lah only two of us\n\n<$B> \n\nSo it does seem that there is quite a lot of scope for you ah\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nNot really tied down to one function forever\n\n<$A> \n\nHe he told me he wants to train me uh in product development\nas well so that I have a wider scope you know ya\n\n\nHe said at the end of the day he wants uh most of us lah to have\nexperience in credit processing means credit checking and then marketing to\nthe new roles and product planning\n\n\nThen he said the new guy that might be coming in will do another\nmajor product\n\n\nSo I'll be with Jasmine\n\n\nIt seems that product quite a lot of work uh\n\n\nIt is a very active product\n\n\nI mean the Club Fifty-five plus he organise a lot of things for\nthe old folks you know and the take up rate is very good\n\n<$B> \n\nOf course\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause it is an on-going\n\n<$B> \n\nAye it's a growth market you know\n\n\nWe have more and more people ageing ah\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd I tell you one secret ah not secret lah one bonus points\nfor us is that OUB is very close to CPF Board and if you want to withdraw you\nknow when you reach fifty-five years you can withdraw ex excess uh over the\nminimum sum and can only withdraw at OUB not any other local banks you know\n\n<$B> \n\nThrough OUB ah\n\n<$A> \n\nOnly OUB\n\n\nYou come to OUB you with the CPF statement stating how much you\nhave in excess over your minimum sum then we'll give you a cashier's order or\ncash and then at that point in time of course they will\n\n<$B> \n\nSell\n\n<$A> \n\nOh why don't deposit into our account\n\n\nSo we are the only bank given that\n\n<$B> \n\nright\n\n<$A> \n\nRight ya and because of our linkage with CPF Board ah we have\naccess to all the data-base you know\n\n<$B> \n\nI thought that is confidential\n\n<$A> \n\nCannot be confidential lah because we are the paying agent\nnah\n\n\nWe we have to have the dividends also and we make use of that lah\nto send direct mailers\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's a growing lah\n\n<$A> \n\nYa that's why Jasmine has to work sort of like full-time you\nknow on this product and cut time on the the credit procession\n\n\nAye you don't want to cut into half ah\n\n<$B> \n\nOh oh for me in this size is is okay\n\n<$A> \n\nNormally I like to cut into half\n\n<$B> \n\nYa then cut lor\n\n\nThese two for me ah\n\n<$A> \n\nHor the rest I cut\n\n\nIt's easier to fry also because the burnt corners\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's the differences that we have\n\n<$A> \n\nAre you meeting that Phuah fellow on Friday ah\n\n<$B> \n\nTentatively lah\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay lor anyway only Thursday ah\n\n<$B> \n\nHe may not turn up also\n\n<$A> \n\nAi ya\n\n<$B> \n\nNo lah not that he won't turn up he may cancel it\n\n\nI think he's he's okay\n\n\nSounds like he got lot of things to tell me\n\n\nThis is a lot\n\n<$A> \n\nI must make courtesy\n\n<$B> \n\nWe haven't cook\n\n<$A> \n\nI must make courtesy calls to your EDB people\n\n<$B> \n\nAh why\n\n<$A> \n\nIf they have any companies that come to them for help uh I'm\nsure when you were there did any company come to you and ask you how to go\nabout making a loan\n\n<$B> \n\nNo they they they know\n\n\nI mean that that basic things they know\n\n\nI mean if they can't let government know\n\n<$A> \n\nDo you recommend any banks also\n\n<$B> \n\nNo we're not supposed to\n\n<$A> \n\nOh oh\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause we maybe you know accuse of favoritism so by big six\nconsulting we are not supposed to leh although we know that that the manager\nvery well and he's supposed to be quite cool lah\n\n\nWe are not supposed to because they can come around and and and\nsay that aye you say that lah then we'll be in trouble\n\n<$A> \n\nAye you have not cook the rice lah\n\n<$B> \n\nHa\n\n<$A> \n\nThe rice\n\n<$B> \n\nYa lah I have to get excuse\n\n<$A> \n\nNever mind never mind I do lah\n\n\nOh then how\n\n<$B> \n\nI think ah there's no need lah because because most companies\nthey do know how to go to the bank\n\n\nThey don't need to come to EDB and then they say\n\n<$A> \n\nYa lah but they don't come to me leh you know\n\n\nI feel like handling the hot-line\n\n\nI'm better at tele-marketing\n\n\nDon't know lah\n\n\nMaybe I'll ask\n\n<$B> \n\nMaybe you go the branch first and to take a look what's the\nsituation\n\n<$A> \n\nSo because back in DBS through the hot-line you pull in a lot\nof customers you know especially housing loans\n\n<$B> \n\nAye ya hot-line is handled by the\n\n<$A> \n\nGirls but they can ref they can pass the phone to me if they\nhave housing loan and apartments\n\n\nActually housing loan you need a more\n\n<$B> \n\nofficer\n\n<$A> \n\nYa they should will definitely ask oh what is your financial\nterm\n\n\nDo we need evaluation from you\n\n\nThey need all this what\n\n\nYou didn't switch on or what\n\n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nThe pickup rate for machinery loans has increased\n\n\nThe past year it has drop\n\n<$A> \n\nAye but I read in the brochure ah in my product book ah guide\nbook your OEMS overseas you also cater for those who want to purchase shares\nin foreign companies you know\n\n<$B> \n\nUh coming as from\n\n<$A> \n\nAh but they put there you know for uh purchase of industrial\nfacilities machines and purchase of shares\n\n<$B> \n\nWah\n\n<$A> \n\nI'm sorry\n\n<$B> \n\nMaybe there's something I don't know\n\n\nI I mean either that one is wrong or I'm not updated but the last\ntime we have EBD aux and all that you know when this was mentioned it was no\nmention of that \n\n\nActually it's unlikely you know because you buy shares uh you'll\nlead to speculation it's just like buying you know\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd your equity local equity is thirty or fifty per cent ah\n\n<$B> \n\nYou must have at least fifty-one per cent OEMS\n\n<$A> \n\nOverseas also\n\n<$B> \n\nLo locals\n\n\nOverseas uh not necessary but you will if if you are

know he's very <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n\nI never think that he's <unclear> word </unclear> until I\n<unclear> word </unclear> him in performing ah\n\n\nMaybe I I I guess I'm being too harsh to jump into to suspect that\nhe's gay but one thing is for sure it's he's a bit you know he's a bit\n\n<$G> \n\nBy the way <unclear> word </unclear> question\n\n\nIf you know one of the <unclear> word </unclear> right how would\nyou\n\n<$F> \n\nIf he respect me\n\n<$G> \n\nI mean lets say he's not interested in you know lah\n\n\nI mean let's say he's not your type lah\n\n<$F> \n\nYou know I will only treat him as a friend\n\n<$G> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$F> \n\nThere is nothing wrong to remain as friends as long is that\nhe doesn't\n\n<$G> \n\nIt is easy to say that\n\n\nIt is easy

ecological\n\n<$G> \n\nYou know why I mean I <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$F> \n\nPartly because the problem is no longer a Western <unclear>\nword </unclear>\n\n\nIt becomes a <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$G> \n\nNo longer of the of the developing world lah and because the\nproblem started from the West right\n\n<$F> \n\nDoesn't it doesn't no it kind of started from Africa\n\n<$G> \n\nYa but it is like transported because of some Western values\nyou see so the thing is whether that problem uh has become a international\nthing\n\n\nAnd so definitely\n\n<$F> \n\nYou mean to say the culprit is now the West\n\n\nThat is why <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$G> \n\nI think so\n\n\nYou see it is no longer a it is it's it's no longer a Western\nthing you know\n\n\nA lot of Americans have aids\n\n\nYou get what I mean\n\n\nNow is that a lot of Thais have aids because of what\n\n<$F> \n\nYes yes yes\n\n<$G> \n\nYou know\n\n<$F> \n\nI know what you mean\n\n<$G> \n\nAnd you can't say it is because of the Thais themselves\n\n\nSomeone must have forced it\n\n\nIn order to under to accept that right you also accept\nresponsibility of course\n\n\nSo I would rather not talk about it",

okay okay\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd of course the more significant of the two events the\nwedding of Kao Yen and Geraldine\n\n\nThen my cousin would say in many ways these events are similar\n\n\nOne person has been elected to lead the nation the other has been\nelected to head a new family\n\n\nThen I'll come in and say and I'm sure Geraldine must be thrilled\nwith her power and responsibility and then we'll on\n\n\nThis is just an introduction okay\n\n<$A> \n\nAlright\n\n<$B> \n\nThe interlude I won't <unclear> word </unclear> the interlude\n\n<$A> \n\nDo your song and dance is it\n\n<$B> \n\nNo no

typical corny sort of thing but we're going to\n\n<$A> \n\nBy the way you surely invited <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nOf course not You know what Liang wanted to say\n\n\nHow did Yen meet up

spy network is entirely faulty\n\n\nAwful dreadful woman\n\n\nDo you know grandmother is dreadful\n\n\nShe's absolutely awful\n\n\nI mean she's like she doesn't wish you well at all\n\n<$B> \n\nShe no

{"text": "<$A> \n\nSo when visitors come how is it\n\n\nDo you have problems with them\n\n<$B> \n\nNo I think is I mean your time is spent because of the whole\nweek you know like in this case when Joe is in town and being so called CBG\nand now that I'm <unclear> word </unclear> and Kelvin is not around all the\nmeetings you know and all the discussion <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nI mean\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat are you discussing\n\n\nBudget\n\n<$B> \n\nConcern your budget your plan for next year that you meet the\nbudget you know\n\n\nIf your why is your budget so much your growth is not or not very\nhigh you know\n\n\nIt's the same case lah\n\n\nEvery boss <unclear> word </unclear> or you know is are interested\nin their own areas\n\n\nAll they care for is their areas you know like Ben nah Ben Lam\nwho'll be interested for Biotech\n\n<$A> \n\nDid he have meeting with you\n\n<$B> \n\nNot really he did\n\n\nBen doesn't really sit down meeting with me in the sense that but\nhe did ask me after the budget review yesterday count the numbers lah you\nknow whether I'm confident that I'll achieve those figures and how about\nlooking into the other areas and all that\n\n<$A> \n\nHow do you find this boss\n\n\nAre they good\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n\nSome some of them are not much help but so far Keith Chan uh seem\nto be okay\n\n\nI mean quite helpful in that sense you know but Ben I don't not not\nreally Ben Lam lah can't really said depend on him or what but Keith seem to\nbe quite okay but he's too new know what I mean\n\n\nGot to wait and see how it it goes and uh what he says whether he\nclaims that he would help out you know whether he'll do it\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat what do you mean what kind of thing would they do for for\nyou all\n\n<$B> \n\nYou see what they are saying now uh we don't liaise direct\nwith the US you know\n\n\nWe should liaise with the bum but sometimes it's quite difficult\n\n\nCertain issue I go to him he has to go back to the international\npeople\n\n\nSo sometimes end up we'll be writing a fax lah\n\n\nWe see if we write to the international people we CC them we CC our\nboss you know so many people\n\n<$A> \n\nBut why what's the rationale for for you know having them\ncoordinate for you all\n\n<$B> \n\nThem you see them they were supposed to look into areas like\nuhm maybe more of market development market opportunities and all\n\n\nI mean they are supposed to be uh specialised in their area and\nthey go and look into ways that help us to increase our plan or programmes\nyou know increase increase our sales and all that lah\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nThen they're supposed in a way to coordinate for us instead of\nus going to the US and say you know instead they're the only one that contact\nthe US office or whatever\n\n<$A> \n\nBut why why did you say it's not working\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's not working out that well because sometimes certain issue\nthey can't to re they can't help us to resolve\n\n<$A> \n\nLike what\n\n\nPrice issue or what\n\n<$B> \n\nMost areas of price issue that we have free hand as long as we\nwe know our standard course we can work on it you know\n\n\nThe only deviation so far that I'm working with uh that controls\nour price to our distributors uh customers in Thailand\n\n\nThey control it because in the first place their demand is greater\nthan supply and\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's true\n\n<$B> \n\nSo you know they get the best they want a higher price\n\n\nOther countries are willing to pay\n\n\nSome of our Asia Pacific countries uh South Asia ah are not willing\n\n\nWe can't afford to pay that high\n\n<$A> \n\nSo end up you can't sell right\n\n<$B> \n\nYa you can't get the goods you may\n\n<$A> \n\nIf that's the case how to set a budget if if the US quotes\nthat way\n\n<$B> \n\nNo man in his\n\n\nThen US sake the rest of you will say you can make this price then\nwe supply\n\n\nThere's a minimum price lah you have to have a minimum price lah\n\n\nI mean no doubt we know it's quality product but it depends on\nindividual country status you know whether can they afford to pay that amount\nof money\n\n\nSo sometimes quite difficult for us you know\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat if they work that way\n\n\nWhat's the point of setting a budget\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> Uh\n\n\nNo I mean you that's the base lah that means that's your ASB then\nyou know with this amount of price how much you can sell\n\n\nThen you work on it lah\n\n\nThen you get a budget lah\n\n<$A> \n\nBut if later\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat\n\n<$A> \n\nYou bid for it you won't get it\n\n<$B> \n\nNo no once no that's right they have this in this case like\nhighland <unclear> word </unclear> issue they have cater allocate you with\nthe thing so you let's say they ask you for a minimum price and we agreed\n\n\nOkay our customers are willing to accept the minimum price then\nthey uh they ask how much quantity you want and you tell them this is the\nquantity you want\n\n\nThen if they can locate you the full amount they give you the full\namount\n\n\nThat means will be allocated quantities to you at this price then\nthat's it\n\n\nNo even if let's say in <unclear> word </unclear> in later stage uh\nother countries are willing to pay higher they cannot give my allocated\nquantity to them in that sense you see\n\n\nBut once I've agreed to this price during the budgeting time I'll\nif my I'm allocated this quantity this quantity will be for me lah\n\n\nBut of course if I can't sell this quantity then there's another\nissue lah\n\n\nThat means I didn't raise my budget you see\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nGet what I mean\n\n\nIf I get can sell it I'll get it lah you know\n\n\nIf I can sell at this price I'll get it lah\n\n<$A> \n\nSo that would mean before you uh present your budget you\nactually have to strike an agreement with them\n\n<$B> \n\nThey come up with us\n\n\nIt's only in highland we do\n\n\nThis is only highland because it's an exceptional case in the sense\nthat sometimes you don't have uhm but actually supply is I mean demand is\ngreater than supply\n\n\nBut certain other products too have a minimum like price but most\nof the other places they don't\n\n\nThey have a recommended price in that sense that to sell it to your\ndistributors or whatever you see\n\n\nThen it's up to you lah whether you how much issue you wanna make\nyou see\n\n\nThailand is only exception\n\n\nLike just now when we're talking about the endoscope that we are\nthe only one with the endoscope\n\n\nI mean it's such a rare that one they only have five for the let\nsay they're talking about manufacturing only five for the whole world\nadditional month\n\n\nThat's like you know allocation you know see who the gotta see who\nis the they even choose whom to give the price the the sell the scope to\n\n\nSo they want somebody who is of uh can have act as a reference\ncentre you know and all that\n\n\nSo not everybody who wants it can get it in this case\n\n<$A> \n\nEndo endoscope is this the the fifth newest product\n\n<$B> \n\nNo CBD products\n\n\nLIS products\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat if I say don't\n\n<$B> \n\nMore than heart wanna open companies\n\n\nCan go in and sees like camera okay\n\n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nBut why is it an open heart thing\n\n<$B> \n\nFor this only an open heart surgery\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy they make so few\n\n<$B> \n\nCapacity and all that <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nIt seems that the scope is not the issue it's the the catitus that\nthey use to put with the scope\n\n\nIt's like they have collection capacity problem is it\n\n<$A> \n\nBut like they only make five sets to sell every year\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know how many sets lah but they have like restricted\nquantities ya\n\n<$A> \n\nSo miserable\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nHow can we meet our sales target\n\n<$B> \n\nHah\n\n<$A> \n\nHow was Henry's presentation do you know\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know\n\n\nHe seen and came out and tell me\n\n\nI said how was it\n\n\nOh have to increase another two hundred dollars\n\n\nObviously you know where\n\n\nI ask him where's that money gonna come from\n\n\nLook's like I just contributed another hundred thousand\n\n\nTerrible\n\n\nJust like the other time when after the first review came back ah\nhe said oh we have to increase further says that the growth wasn't\nsatisfactory and ask Kelvin and myself to look into our area and Susan and\nthe best part is Kelvin increase the area under where CBG area which he's\nhanding to me\n\n\nSo that's why in the end what Henry says was you know Kelvin has\nstill got to share the responsibility you know of the budget figures for next\nyear because all those budget figures was put up by him\n\n<$A> \n\nThis is Priya <unclear> word </unclear> always

to do it my own lor\n\n<$C> \n\nThere's a conspiracy going on which I know about Uhm really\nnot going ah\n\n<$A> \n\nNo I'm sure to sleep there\n\n<$C> \n\nThat's what I'm worried about actually\n\n<$A> \n\nI might as well do something productive\n\n<$B> \n\nThat means you want to skip the lecture\n\n\nYou also\n\n<$C> \n\nCannot cannot\n\n\nIf I skip also then nobody is going to go there\n\n<$B> \n\nYou you send one rep\n\n<$A> \n\nAye just like the case of last year that time at first so\nmany then we count\n\n<$B> \n\nSo boring the lecture\n\n<$C> \n\nIt's not terribly boring\n\n\nI don't think so\n\n\nIt's just that the voice or tone he has the the tone of voice he\nadopts\n\n<$B> \n\nWho is the lecturer\n\n<$C> \n\nNo no\n\n<$A> \n\nCannot say\n\n<$C> \n\nWhy should you destroy his reputation\n\n\nHe's an internationally known figure okay\n\n<$B> \n\nWho who <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd furthermore he's yet to grade me right\n\n\nNo lah\n\n\nIt's not that he's really marked you know\n\n\nIt's just that the tone is too monotonous\n\n\nRight after a while you\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's just like one of the Chinese lecturers\n\n<$C> \n\nReally\n\n<$B> \n\nHah\n\n\nYou know that\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat what's his name\n\n<$C> \n\nNow there's another conspiracy that I know about\n\n\nI think he's uhm he's he's very nice person\n\n\nWhen he speaks he's much better in tutorials actually\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> they all not impress\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAre are you going\n\n<$C> \n\nProbably\n\n<$A> \n\nOn our behalf\n\n<$C> \n\nMust be lah or else he look around and can't find me and then\nwhat\n\n<$A> \n\nBorrow your your tutorial to record\n\n<$B> \n\nYa it's a good idea <unclear> word </unclear> taping\n\n<$C> \n\nTaping\n\n\nNo I don't think it works very well\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd it takes time to to listen you know <unclear> word\n</unclear> to do the transcript\n\n<$C> \n\nDecipher ya\n\n<$B> \n\nBut actually nothing to say right especially for Econs\nlecture\n\n\nYou just copy everything from transparency\n\n<$A> \n\nThe thing is he doesn't have comprehensive transparencies\n\n<$C> \n\nThe guy survives on two transparencies per lecture\n\n<$B> \n\nTwo transparencies\n\n\nIf that is a good trans\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know how he lecture or not\n\n\nDictation\n\n<$B> \n\nOh take out a book read read read read read\n\n<$A> \n\nFull-stop\n\n\nAll his sentences is very well phrased <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nIt's very difficult to to catch\n\n<$B> \n\nEcons eh\n\n\nIt's not language or others like History or Geography\n\n<$C> \n\nNo\n\n\nThe thing is he he reads like he writes\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> Don't tell me that he just take out\none textbook and read from the textbook\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's not a text\n\n\nIt's his own\n\n<$C> \n\nNo\n\n\nIt it it he prepared he prepared the thing you see but he reads\nthe way he writes\n\n<$A> \n\nThat means once we get hold of that book it's gone already\n\n<$B> \n\nJust knock at his door sir may I have\n\n<$C> \n\nNo he'll throw it at you literally throw it at you\n\n\nNo it's just that\n\n<$A> \n\nI I think this is not a very suitable topic\n\n\nIt's a very interesting topic\n\n<$C> \n\nYou have any help\n\n\nThis is what grads talk about all day\n\n<$B> \n\nInteresting\n\n<$C> \n\nNo I've always find him a very nice person you see\n\n\nWhen you have something he really meant you know so much\n\n\nIt's just that he reads you see and that makes us very hard to\ncopy down\n\n\nBecause by the time he gets to the middle of the sentence I just\ngot to the middle of the sentence you've already lost it\n\n\nHe could finish it but we can't\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd the words are not simple\n\n<$C> \n\nThat's why I said he reads as he writes\n\n\nWhen you're writing\n\n<$B> \n\nUse symbols\n\n\nUse symbols\n\n<$A> \n\nSymbols\n\n<$B> \n\nLike for example change you draw a tri one triangle\n\n<$A> \n\nNo different\n\n<$C> \n\nNo no\n\n<$A> \n\nThis kind we are used to he use\n\n<$C> \n\nHe use bombastic words\n\n<$A> \n\nAh so how you change it to symbols\n\n\nBomb draw a bomb\n\n<$C> \n\nI think more time to draw a bomb then to write the word\n\n<$B> \n\nActually for example he says something that you are not very\nsure about the word lah then I don't how to say is you try to form the words\nlor\n\n<$C> \n\nNo actually actually we know the words most of the time\n\n<$A> \n\nWe know you see\n\n\nWe can't\n\n<$C> \n\nIt's just that we send it takes so much to write the word\n\n<$B> \n\nMake it short lor\n\n<$A> \n\nThe sentence is full of complicated words so you need to\nwrite all the words before that sentence can come out\n\n\nYou cannot shorten it then it'll lose the meaning\n\n<$B> \n\nThen shorthand lor\n\n\nThis is the only solution\n\n\nYes serious\n\n<$C> \n\nWhy don't you just decide <unclear> word </unclear> to sneak\ninto his room and sort of pinch the book\n\n<$A> \n\nA E also can't finish can learn shorthand\n\n<$B> \n\nAye do you know that I use shorthand for my Chinese lecture\n\n\nDo you know that\n\n<$C> \n\nEverybody use shorthand\n\n<$A> \n\nNo his is professional shorthand\n\n<$C> \n\nNo\n\n<$B> \n\nShorthand\n\n<$C> \n\nFor Chinese I thought it's what we call short forms\n\n<$A> \n\nShorthand not short forms\n\n\nShorthand\n\n<$C> \n\nI don't ben <unclear> word </unclear> you\n\n<$A> \n\nProve prove\n\n<$B> \n\nYou want to see my Chinese lecture notes\n\n<$C> \n\nYes I would like to\n\n<$B> \n\nI think it's missing <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nIt's in a hurry\n\n\nIt's not with me now\n\n<$C> \n\nNext time next time don't worry there's always time\n\n<$B> \n\nI use shorthand\n\n<$C> \n\nYou own set is it\n\n<$B> \n\nMy own set\n\n\nWhat do you mean my own set\n\n\nThat means I I\n\n<$C> \n\nYour own shorthand aye aye I've got to go or else or else I\nwon't be able to catch the lecture\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay bye bye\n\n<$C> \n\nYa \n\n\n\n<$A> \n\nShe got to call up one of her boys\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm \n\n<$C> \n\nCalling her boy\n\n<$B> \n\nHer boy\n\n\nWhich boy\n\n<$C> \n\nTom Dick Henry\n\n\nIt's not

{"text": "<$A> \n\nSo what do you think of the A E presentation we had yesterday\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm it was okay\n\n\nWe we got to know about their projects uhm the outcome why they\nchoose the projects the type of methodology they use the philosophical\nunderpinnings etcetera\n\n\nSo how then\n\n\nHow you gonna present yours\n\n<$A> \n\nI haven't actually think about it but from what yesterday the\nimpression is that uh there's not much of questions being posed to the\npresenters lah and I personally hope that the presenters and the teacher\nmight not take it might not take questions uhm too personally\n\n\nI mean not as an attack uh personal attack or something like that\n\n\nIt's just a purely academic enquiry something like that\n\n\nSo it will be more interesting in that sense lah because actually\nthere's a lot of uh things that I wanted to ask lah but judging from the face\nof the presenter I dare not lah because they might think otherwise you see\n\n\nSo that is the thing you know\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd I guess the other problem is that it deals with Physical\nGeography and it's not our line so call so we may not be able to to to\ndiscuss the issue in greater depth and in detail and also we may not know\nthat issues in\n\n<$A> \n\nYou didn't take Physical Geog\n\n<$B> \n\nI do I do but really another way in in to think it is that uhm\nI don't want to ask too many questions and because you not not only\n\n<$A> \n\nBad guy\n\n<$B> \n\nNot the bad guy but simply you you know they standing down\nthere they'll be very very\n\n<$A> \n\nNervous\n\n<$B> \n\nNervous\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd I mean\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd they don't want to be asked\n\n\nYes and not only that you know it no matter you are the first batch\nor the later batch if you are down there you'll be very nervous and you hope\nthat nobody gonna ask you questions because there's always this fear whereby\nwhat happen if I cannot answer\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nRight\n\n<$A> \n\nSo be it\n\n<$B> \n\nI know so be it but you know you'll you'll definitely feel\nthat you failed you know like you are not that good but especially when you\nyou notice that there are people who would are able to do pretty well and you\nare comparing yourself with him so you <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nOh I might have done that bad so I won't get that much good grades\nyou know something\n\n<$A> \n\nSometime their presentation is\n\n<$B> \n\nYa I admit\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's just a\n\n<$B> \n\nYa ya\n\n<$A> \n\nPart of the grading\n\n\nIt's not the whole of the grading you see so you shouldn't be bog\ndown to anxiety or you know being not able to answer the questions but must\ntake it in the positive light lah positive spirit that's the whole thing\n\n\nThen there's a lively discussion nah not a very quiet session just\na presenter doing his job or something\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I guess it I guess the topic dealt with is Physical so no\npeople really bother or they don't know they're not in the line to to ask\nquestions so I guess when it comes to the later portion\n\n<$A> \n\nYa maybe the Human\n\n<$B> \n\nThe Human side whereby there'll be more people asking more\nquestion because you are more familiar with the issues\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nYa definitely\n\n<$A> \n\nSo your your topic falls under what\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay mine is Behavioural meaning that I'm looking at the\nlocational decisions of firms which are found near Changi Airport so in that\nsense I'm asking about why they decide to locate at Changi\n\n\nHas the factors in Changi attract them meaning uhm do the airport\ndoes the airport uh create a conducive environment for them to to to acquire\ntheir products overseas or to sell their products in overseas market\n\n\nUhm at the same time I'm looking at the spatial patterns uhm is\nthere any special areas whereby these firms will locate\n\n\nAre they being dictated by their own choices or by government\nsomething like that\n\n\nAlthough my main concern is actually on the uhm growth pole I mean\nthe airport has a growth centre in terms of natural forces meaning naturally\nyou will develop because the airport is there and you attract the firms to\nthat location\n\n\nBut I know definitely the government will play a very important\nrole so I had to look into the qualitative issue rather than the quantitative\nissues\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat do they think which are\n\n<$B> \n\nMeaning that I got to conduct surveys interviews with the stat\nboards\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd have you done so\n\n<$B> \n\nYes and it's not easy because they're not willing to talk that\nmuch\n\n<$A> \n\nIs a is a not\n\n<$B> \n\nIs a ya and they are not willing to disclose too many\ninformations so that could be\n\n\nAnother problem which I face is not many of my surveyed form are\nreturned so my sampling size are pretty small actually\n\n<$A> \n\nSampling size interview\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nSo are you going to do anything about it because normally when\nyou select the sample size right you'll take into account of\nrepresentativeness whether the size if representative or where the issue that\nyou're dealing with\n\n\nSo when you come across this problem of survey forms not returned\nthere will definitely in a one way or another affect the representativeness\n\n\nSo what are you gonna to do with it\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay I I agree in that area but thank goodness on my case is\nthat the number of replied are quite equal meaning that I have the number of\nform which I wanted so I'm quite happy with it in that sense but I would\nprefer more you see\n\n\nUsually like for example under one category only have one or two\nreplied form instead of four or five ya so when it's one or two it would\nrepresent the whole you see so that is what I'm worried but as long as I'm\nable to get something is better than nothing\n\n<$A> \n\nIf when you do surveys is normally the case lah unless you do\ninformal surveys over the telephone or doing a tape recording like this then\nyou won't have the problem of surveys not coming back nah\n\n<$B> \n\nThe only problem is that you must get to allow you tape the\nvoices to allow you for such interview\n\n<$A> \n\nBasically a behavioural approach approach uhm mine is\nessential texture it's a post-modern challenge and geographical approach\n\n\nUh basically I'll be looking at the heminetical aspect that means\nin terms of uh interpreting language\n\n\nThe text here shall refer to the newspapers lah that of my main\nsource of information for it\n\n\nUhm I'll be looking at environmental issues as contain in the\nnewspaper uh time series analysis of four years\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy environment is is there any other\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's geographical in a sense because the approach is looking\nat text the newspapers as text and it's geographical because we are looking\nat environment\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nYa how how the media especially the the Malay newspapers has\nbeen instrumental in in so-called instilling a sense of environmental\nawareness amongst the community lah\n\n\nSo that that is so you can call it a hypothesis so so to say uhm in\nterms of environmental awareness among the Malay community\n\n\nWhy did <unclear> word </unclear> the role of media has been\npositive positive or otherwise\n\n\nSo basically that's it lah and the research thing has been going\nrather slow and it's brilliant\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's takes quite a lot of time ya\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause you're dealing with not one or two newspapers what\nyou're dealing with four years you know four years and that's three hundred\nand sixty-five times four\n\n\nOver such a short period of few months and having a lot of other\nthings to do I wish I could have done more lah in the sense because there are\nother areas that is worth looking lah in terms of what let's say production\nof production and consumption of environmental meanings because right now uh\nwhat I'm dealing with is under consumption part how the the the readers\nspecially the Malay community so called decode uh interpret the what is\nwritten in the newspapers lah\n\n\nI'm not dealing much on the con production side ya\n\n\nProduction is a a more intricate thing you got you got to know who\nare the writers\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy they want\n\n<$A> \n\nAh their intent intention all this so\n\n\nEdmund is dealing with the production side because he's dealing\nmore towards the the the production of comics\n\n\nUh so but he has a so-called access to the interviews written by\nothers on the with respect to the authors lah the the comic writers lah\n\n\nSo maybe he can use that as a as a basis of uhm ya the production\nside so I don't have access because nobody has interviewed any of the\njournalists and\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy don't you try and interview them\n\n\nI mean wouldn't that be easily maybe you can\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I tried I'm I'm going to interview them only after I have\nestablish my\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay your record\n\n<$A> \n\nYes my research findings because without the research findings\nyou go there and you tried to interview you don't have that you know yes\n\n\nBecause if you have the research findings when you go there it's\nlike your have the thing back in your mind and when they say something which\nis\n\n<$B> \n\nNot correct\n\n<$A> \n\nah contrary to your research findings it's much easier for you\nto so-called you know highlight the thing but on the other hand ya if you\ndon't have the research findings in place before prior to the interview then\nit's quite difficult\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat else  \n\n\n\n<$A> \n\nI'm quite interested about the P S C lah especially on the\neducation service but uh my main thrust is to ask them what is because uhm\nlately there has been calls for increasing teachers' pay so but the details\nhas has not been made known to public so maybe I I hope they can ya that's\nright\n\n\nBut I don't think they will tell me everything lah in details but\nwhat I suppose is that they will not exactly touch on the starting pay but\nmore on the increment yearly increment nah because the Civil Service yearly\nin increment is very little can say is very little\n\n<$B> \n\nWell for my case I won't be interested of any of these simply\nbecause I'm already bonded so uhm there's no room for me to look other career\nuntil or unless somebody can bail me out of this trap\n\n<$A> \n\nAh ha but you have to pay uh\n\n<$B> \n\nYa you got\n\n<$A> \n\nIf you want to break the bond you have to pay\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I have to pay the whole lump sum\n\n<$A> \n\nI think it's about thirty to forty thousand\n\n<$B> \n\nOr maybe more I don't know\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nI can't I I don't bother actually because I thought that uhm\nsince they already I mean since I have this scholarship and they already\nensured me a job\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's a six year scholarship\n\n<$B> \n\nYes it's a six six years bond\n\n\nWell if you were to continue teaching I mean if you intend to\nteach right so we might in the same line because my scholarship is actually\nteaching\n\n<$A> \n\nTeaching scholarship lah\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nDo you know the starting starting pay\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I'm not very sure\n\n\nI guess it's about two thousand\n\n<$A> \n\nTwo thousand odd\n\n<$B> \n\nFor guys because of the N S thing lah yes\n\n<$A> \n\nBut during the the course at N I E will be about one thousand\nthree right and I mean ya one thousand three hundred\n\n<$B> \n\nWell about it\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd I've been looking through the past years in terms of this\nuh grant you know I mean teaching grant or teaching bursary whatever they\ncall it\n\n\nIt has been static static at three one thousand three hundred you\nknow whereas the general degree uh student-teachers their teaching bursary\nhas been\n\n<$B> \n\nRaised\n\n<$A> \n\nYa has been raised over the years ya but this uh Honours for\nfor the Honours student the the the teaching bursary has not been disturbed\nat all\n\n\nSo it has been rather static at one thousand three hundred \n\n\nSo what what do you think this one thousand three hundred\n\n\nDo you think it's enough\n\n<$B> \n\nWell actually uhm maybe not now maybe later when the time\ncomes I guess the problem will be there\n\n\nI really don't because presently you don't need the money so and\nyou I guess you won't feel the difference but unless during that time when\nyou start to be involved in the whole programme and you need the money then\nyou starts to voice out again\n\n\nSo normally you just tackle the problem when the problems come\nlah\n\n<$A> \n\nDo you think uh the education service has done uh done their\npart in terms of retaining the the talented the best in terms of uh teachers\n\n<$B> \n\nWell if you were to look at my case most of my lect tutors\nin J Cs they have left\n\n\nYa in fact they are all quite good simply because other places or\nrather the private sides are paying them more than what the teaching line are\ndoing so I guess one of the method is the pay\n\n\nAnother one would definitely be the extra things which you will\nhave to be involve especially E C As uhm maybe setting out some funny\nprogrammes uh schemes uhm camp especially\n\n<$A> \n\nCamp\n\n<$B> \n\nYa some some are involve in like you know English camps in\nvideo camps\n\n\nWhat have you\n\n<$A> \n\nSo to make the career more ex exciting in a sense lah\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nBut what what do you think of\n\n\nOkay so far the the\n\n<$B> \n\nI guess the problem is the burden they have\n\n\nIf the principal is able to get uhm some other extra personnels\nto dealt with to\n\n\nI mean to to\n\n<$A> \n\nTo deal with the\n\n<$B> \n\nTo to to deal with this\n\n<$A> \n\nAdministrative\n\n<$B> \n\nnNt only administrative matters but maybe the E C As you\nknow like you know like maybe for instance to talk about N P C C maybe can\nget some of those people who are more involve in N P C C to to to become\nguidence or counsellor rather than rather than to get the locals", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "15290fa3-7d14-4308-ae07-4dffa7a953f5", "added":

{"text": "<$A>\n\nActually the the only thing that we have uh I mean the don't\nknow lah I mean my school we we we we always thought that the that the\nheadquarters didn't like us\n\n<$B>\n\nWhy\n\n<$A>\n\nThere is some kind of conception or misconception or some sort\nlah\n\n<$B>\n\nReally\n\n<$A>\n\nI mean because we we we won a lot of competitions\n\n<$B>\n\nTrue\n\n<$A>\n\nYa the fact I mean my my school like swept a lot of prizes you\nsee so uh uh it was like oh well I mean you've won so many why don't you give\nother schools a chance you know\n\n\nOh hi Lyn\n\n<$B>\n\nHi\n\n<$A>\n\nYou want to me in this\n\n<$B>\n\nWe are still talking\n\n\nIf you want to join in and take over from me then I can make my\nmove\n\n\nAre you sure\n\n\nThat is about another twenty more minutes to go\n\n\nIt's just talking to us I mean\n\n<$A>\n\nMaking conversation\n\n\nOkay all right\n\n\nYa so so ya I mean I they they they they thought that that we won a\nlittle too many lah so ya but there was well I always thought Red Cross\nshould stand for uh the first aid sign lah\n\n\nSo actually when when I don't know I uhm when when my my school did\nbetter in foot drill I I did question the the rationale\n\n\nLook you know what I mean\n\n\nThis you are you're you're supposed surely ought to be better in\nfirst aid\n\n\nWhat I mean isn't what the Red cross is all about\n\n\nYa so I guess the people were not very happy because obviously you\nknow the foot drill was such a big thing in the Red Cross as well\n\n<$B>\n\nWell I think they view in terms of like like all\nuniform-groups\n\n\nOne of the obvious reason or objective is to have discipline\n\n<$A>\n\nThat's true\n\n<$B>\n\nSo if you don't have discipline then you can't do a lot of\nthings\n\n<$A>\n\nThat's true that's true\n\n<$B>\n\nSo I that is the reason why I I was actually put in charge of\nthe drills\n\n<$A>\n\nAll right\n\n<$B>\n\nDiscipline is very important\n\n<$A>\n\nRight\n\n<$A>\n\nI remember I was in charge of a pla platoon and uh they were\nall juniors of course\n\n\nI was senior at that time you see and uh they actually uh could not\ndo a drill well\n\n\nYou know the timing is important and all that so uh there was one\nparticular drill where actually which the they form and the was not up to par\nand I I I while I make a big hoo ha out of it and then they cried after that\n\n\nIt was quite quite uh uh quite dramatic in a sense but I think I\nwas trying to stress to them the importance of it\n\n\nTeamwork very important because we are training for competition\nformation where you have to be very precise and you have to cooperate with\neach other\n\n\nSo if you don't cooperate then there is not uniformity at all so\nthat that was uh one of things I remember when I was in school that time\n\n\nSo I guess you didn't really like much drills and all that\n\n<$A>\n\nNo actually uh for foot drill I did quite well\n\n\nYa I think I did quite well at foot drill\n\n\nI enjoyed uhm ya the formations and all that lah\n\n\nI mean it was like quite fun lah you know but there is a lot of\nhard work lah and I think that because of because of so much drill actually\nuhm you know physiologically my legs like grew a lot more than my arms\n\n<$B>\n\nLonger\n\n<$A>\n\nNot not longer but I think the the leg muscles are a lot\nbetter develop or my leg muscles are a lot better develop than than muscles\nelsewhere on my body you see\n\n\nYa so my father said that if you don't do push ups you look like a\nkangaroo\n\n\nYa anyway I I actually join the Red Cross because uh I I was hoping\nto to practice uh to go into medical practice\n\n<$B>\n\nOh I see\n\n<$A>\n\nYa so it was like you know look you know there there is some\nkind of connections so why don't I just use it like a trump card lah so to\nspeak\n\n\nBut actually I mean all my involvement with Red Cross uh wasn't I\nmean I I I don't think the the universities took it very seriously because\nyou say oh well you know my interest\n\n\nYa I got Red-cross to to prove four years but apparently the the\nuniversity isn't very interested because I got some other friends who did a\nlot better at their A levels which Red Cross took book as well and still\ndidn't make it to in medical school so ya I suppose\n\n<$B>\n\nSo why did you go into law\n\n<$A>\n\nUhm\n\n<$B>\n\nHow did you go into law then\n\n<$A>\n\nUh I thought on the strength of my English language competency\nlah\n\n\nYa\n\n<$B>\n\nWhat do you mean by competency\n\n<$A>\n\nNo I mean it's like I I think I'm I'm I'm fairly comfortable\nwith the English language so\n\n<$B>\n\nWritten and oral\n\n<$A>\n\nWritten and oral written oral so uh well I mean if if if if if\nI am really lousy at the Sciences you know why don't I at least use some\nasset that I have which is competency in English so you know use it in in in\nin a field of study which which requires that kind of command\n\n\nUh uh I mean I I won't consider myself proficient lah because there\nare a lot of words which I still don't use don't know how to use don't know\nthe meaning of so uh ya\n\n<$B>\n\nWhat's your opinion now of this Singlish\n\n\nDo you think that we should talk the way the other Singaporeans are\ntalking or should we talk the way we have been uh taught and brought up to to\nto speak like a normal you know rofessional at work\n\n<$A>\n\nWell I think it depends on the uh situation in which you use\nyour language\n\n\nUhm\n\n<$B>\n\nLet us say now we are talking I mean would would it would be\nmore like uh personal right\n\n\nLet us say the situation calls for it then uh we have of course uh\nsome Singlish thing you know injected into it the conversation\n\n<$A>\n\nYa it is true I uh I mean obviously if you want to do a\nprofessional presentation then you jolly well mind your grammmar\n\n<$B>\n\nThat's that is true that is important\n\n<$A>\n\nJust like when we are we are delivering a lecture then I think\nit has to be of course of a certain standard not so much Singlish but the\nSinglish is used to illustrate a probably a a some some what you call uh some\njokes along the way to make the lecture more interesting and to also the\nrelate to the students who are more more or less uh very localise in the\n<unclear> word </unclear> in the Singaporean uh context\n\n<$B>\n\nYa no but uh you know have you ever considered this this\nquestion\n\n\nIf supposing now like like for instance right now uh Ngee Ann Poly\nyou know they they have this Business Chinese Business Mandarin course right\n\n\nUhm I mean suggesting that actually the the level of lang of of\nMandarin spoken in Singapore is not really quite up to par so that is why you\ngot to use uh uh you you got to teach uhm Singaporean Chinese the proper\nChinese words which which is understood in Taiwan or or in China\n\n\nI mean isn't if if supposing we all spoke Chinese I mean don't you\nthink there is an equivalent in the Chinese language of Singish\n\n<$B>\n\nYes yes\n\n<$A>\n\nRight\n\n\nSo you know uh\n\n<$B>\n\nSimilar\n\n<$A>\n\nA a similar problem as well\n\n<$B>\n\nYa ya\n\n\nBut is is the problem that big\n\n\nI thought that is not that critical as far as Chinese\n\n<$A>\n\nIt is not\n\n<$B>\n\nNot as critical as I know\n\n\nWell if let's say uh we speak to a Taiwanese now in Mandarin or to\na China Chinese in the normal Chinese language uh or Mandarin for that matter\nI think they still can understand us but if you talk about say dialects let\nus say uh in a different provinces uh then I think it may be a bit difficult\n\n\nBut by and large Chinese I think still I think it is still all\nright\n\n<$A>\n\nOkay well I mean because quite quite definitely like in class\nwhere where we meet with the students and you hear them speak in Mandarin\n\n\nI mean quite obviously it is not hundred per cent Mandarin all the\nway isn't it\n\n<$B>\n\nTrue also\n\n<$A>\n\nBecause they they drop in all kinds of words and and all kind\nI mean they they twist the expressions the other way you see so that it it it\nfollows uh uh maybe the English pattern of of speaking right they just\ntranslate it\n\n<$B>\n\nYa direct translation\n\n<$A>\n\nYa ya that is right\n\n\nSo ya\n\n<$B>\n\nBut I suppose it also depends on who who is talking who you\nare talking to\n\n<$A>\n\nWell true I mean if we all talk in Man if we all use Mandarin\nto teach and I suppose we would all have to speak what up to scratch Mandarin\nbut I mean even now when we teach in English we I actually we don't speak up\nto scratch in English isn't it\n\n<$B>\n\nNo not at all\n\n<$A>\n\nI I mean like for me I know I I drop in a lot of localised\nexpressions\n\n<$B>\n\nYa just to you know like I said to the whole\n\n<$A>\n\nLoosen up ya developing a rapport\n\n<$B>\n\nBut one thing I I feel that it is quite unfortunate is that\nwe have hardly any opportunity to really uhm to use Mandarin or speak\nMandarin\n\n\nLike in my previous job I I still do get the opportunity to do so\nbecause of the Chinese-speaking uh population uh the manufacturers\n\n<$A>\n\nYou will deal with them uh\n\n<$B>\n\nI deal with them I have to talk with them in their lingo\nalthough it is American Multinational\n\n\nUhm but now now that in the teaching profession very difficult\nunless I am teaching a Chinese class but I think that is uh a bit too\ndifficult lah\n\n<$A>\n\nYa correct\n\n<$B>\n\nIn terms of our language ability to really teach the subject\nin Mandarin so to speak probably takes a while to really get a hang of it\n\n<$A>\n\nYa I know I got some\n\n<$B>\n\nAll the concepts\n\n<$A>\n\nI got some students who who want me to speak in Chinese\nsometimes\n\n\nI mean once in a while I do feel quite tempted but it is like if I\ndid that then it would only encourage them to think Chinese and they don't\nimprove in their English but\n\n<$B>\n\nAnd they are supposed to be writing in their English medium\nuh in exams or whatever projects and <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A>\n\nYou know but in a sense I do sympathise with them because\nthey say look you know what I mean\n\n\nIt's it's not that we want to how should I say it's it's to aid\nthem in their understanding of the concept\n\n\nExpression of course is another way lah but what is the concept\nthey have this problem you see so I mean ya I I do agree lah that sometimes I\nwish I could use Chinese or you know but a lot of reservations\n\n<$B>\n\nYa in case we say the wrong thing\n\n<$A>\n\nYa I suppose it is like I don't want to be laughed at\n\n<$B>\n\nI mean we want to show the best side of what we are\n\n\nOkay it's about three fifty\n\n<$A>\n\nYa all right\n\n<$B>\n\nI think we have to call it at a call it off at this moment\n\n\nWe're running out of things to say\n\n<$A>\n\nAll right then\n\n<$B>\n\nWe certainly hope you find the thing useful and let us know\nhave some feedback at the end of it all\n\n<$A>\n\nThat was T G speaking\n\n\nThank

\n\nFor male and females so you know we didn't feel anything after\nthat\n\n\nYou get used to it\n\n\nI think it's a matter of adaptation so we really it it was really\nan eye-opener\n\n\nAnd when we came back to Singapore we said wow we really appreciate\nSingapore\n\n\nIt's a country I want to live\n\n<$A> \n\nThat's right\n\n\nYa I suppose a country's ya when you visit it's a different thing\nif you were to live in it\n\n\nI think you know there'd be a difference there sort of\n\n<$B> \n\nVisiting is different but living there is another thing\n\n<$A> \n\nSo which parts of China did you go to\n\n<$B> \n\nOh we went to Beijing Xian Wuxi Kweilin Guangzhou Shanghai\nGuangtong and then back to Singapore\n\n<$A> \n\nIs a dam gonna be built at you know\n\n<$B> \n\nOh yes I think they have already started and this would take\nabout ten years and the beautiful tree goddess might be a bit spoilt because\npart of it would be spoilt with the you know the big dam there\n\n\nBut they think it's necessary because they need the hydroelectric\npower\n\n\nThere are people for and also against it I think\n\n\nIt's a national decision\n\n<$A> \n\nYa that's sad ya\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's it's supposed to be very beautiful so why don't you go\nbefore they build the dam\n\n<$A> \n\nThat's true that's true so which which was the part of China\nyou liked best\n\n<$B> \n\nI love Kweilin\n\n<$A> \n\nHa Kweilin\n\n<$B> \n\nThe remote parts\n\n\nI don't like Shanghai and Guangzhou because they're too crowded and\ncramped and the air is polluted and oh it's just like a it's it's another\nconcrete jungle\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm ya I suppose too similar to Singapore uh\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd Hong Kong now and people are there people there are very\nmaterialistic\n\n\nThey just make money money money money regardless\n\n\nThis it's getting quite bad in Shanghai and the there're heads and\nheads and heads everywhere you go just you see people people people\neverywhere\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I was in Hong Kong last year\n\n<$B> \n\nOh you did\n\n<$A> \n\nSo uh ya\n\n\nIt was very uh interesting\n\n\nI like the street activity\n\n\nI walked a lot you know along the streets and the architecture is\nquite dynamic\n\n\nWent into the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation very\nexciting space\n\n<$B> \n\nOh how long were you in Hong Kong\n\n<$A> \n\nOh only a week about a week\n\n<$B> \n\nIs that all\n\n\nYa\n\n\nDid your family or the family went\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no I went on a conference kind of thing\n\n<$B> \n\nOh did you present a paper there\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no last year I didn't I just attended a conference\n\n<$B> \n\nI'm sure you enjoyed it\n\n<$A> \n\nOh yes I enjoyed it and then the people I met at the\nconference were very kind and welcoming and then I met this lady an English\nwoman who lived in Macau and when she invited me to stay with her and I did\n\n<$B> \n\nGood good good\n\n\nDid you speak Cantonese while you were there\n\n<$A> \n\nNo I didn't I\n\n\nYou spoke English I'm afraid\n\n<$B> \n\nLei sek kong kong fu wah ker ma ng sek ker bai yen lau ker lor\nwor\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I I I used my Cantonese and then I tried to direct this\ndriver to this you know this place and uh I mispronounce and then he couldn't\nunderstand\n\n<$B> \n\nThe Hong Kong people can be very sharp with their tongues\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I was quite fortunate\n\n\nThose people I met I you know I'd you know were quite kind really\nya the Hong Kong people I met were quite kind\n\n<$B> \n\nWell you you must have met the the good people\n\n<$A> \n\nYes I didn't go on shopping sprees 'cause shopping isn't my\n<unclear> word </unclear> so but there was some huge shopping centres you\nknow and I I don't like to go to shopping centres really so\n\n\nMacau was very charming\n\n\nI went to the Maritime museum spent a lot of hours there you know\n\n\nIt was beautiful so beautiful exhibits and lovely location\n\n<$B> \n\nYou can see Macau you can see China from Macau\n\n<$A> \n\nI heard that but\n\n<$B> \n\nDid you see\n\n<$A> \n\nNo I didn't\n\n\nI heard there's this hill ya that you can see just right into\nChinese village you know\n\n<$B> \n\nJust look across the sea and that's China\n\n<$A> \n\nYou have been to Macau\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I went sometime ago\n\n\nIt was many years ago\n\n\nI still have a auntie there\n\n\nDo you know what happen to her\n\n\nShe she really ran away from China to Macau when it was hard you\nknow in China\n\n\nSo it was uh a time when many people were trying to run away and\nsome succeeded and some did not succeed\n\n\nSome were killed\n\n\nSome died while escaping you know\n\n\nThat was very terrible\n\n<$A> \n\nSo what's she how old is she now\n\n<$B> \n\nOh she's about sixty plus\n\n\nHer children are all grown-up\n\n\nHer husband is about seventy plus\n\n\nWell he's a painter\n\n\nShe married an artist\n\n<$A> \n\nShe married in in in in in Macau\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nShe met him or she they were married\n\n<$B> \n\nThey were in Singapore\n\n\nYou know in those days they were so they were Chi they are\nChinese-educated and they were so pro China that time so they wanted to get\nto China so they left Singapore to go to China\n\n\nI'm sure they regretted but then what to do they made a decision\n\n\nBut it was hard life\n\n\nIt was a time when Mao Tsi-tung just took over\n\n\nCan you imagine the time where they took over was harsh and the\ncountry was poor and it was just work work work work work and no play\n\n\nSo oh she had a hard life but she does come back once in a while\nto see her sisters and brothers here\n\n<$A> \n\nYa that's pretty unusual\n\n\nYa ya\n\n<$B> \n\nSo when I see people doing that you know it makes you think\nthat you're really lucky to be in Singapore\n\n\nYou have everything you need and it's peaceful here and you have\nat least we don't have hundred per cent freedom you know but you you still do\na lot of things the things that you love to do you can do right\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I think ya basic safety is quite important\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nWell I suppose you know people the basic right to be able to\nwalk safely on the streets at night\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I met a number of foreigners and they said oh Singapore\nis just beautiful\n\n\nYou can you feel so safe on the road even at eleven p m and they\nsay I won't dare to do this in my own country\n\n\nAnd this is not a normal they say\n\n\nIt's not normal to feel so safe in a country\n\n\nSingapore is really extraordinary\n\n\nYou can go to Cairo Saudi Arabia and any part of Europe you know\nyou don't feel so safe especially America and New York even in\n\n<$A> \n\nHave you been to New York ya\n\n<$B> \n\nI didn't go to New York but I just went there to catch a\nplane but I was all the time with friends so I was very sort of looked after\n\n\nBut on my own I won't I don't think I would dare to travel you\nknow in\n\n<$A> \n\nOf course there're certain alleys and places you should not\ngo to\n\n<$B> \n\nYes you must know where to go so you must know the places\n\n<$A> \n\nThat's right\n\n<$B> \n\nNothing like your home\n\n\nHome sweet home\n\n<$A> \n\nAh well yes yes\n\n<$B> \n\nSo do you think you would be travelling uh this long vacation\nwhich is in October\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I hope to take vacation because I got a lot of leave to\nclear\n\n<$B> \n\nYou have forty-two days\n\n\nHave you taken any days leave\n\n<$A> \n\nOh I took a little bit last year\n\n<$B> \n\nJust a few days\n\n<$A> \n\nBut I I have a lot to clear before next year so I should\nmaximise you know the holiday and really take a break\n\n\nI think I need it\n\n<$B> \n\nThen you can't accumulate for too long\n\n<$A> \n\nNo you can't carry forward for one or two years\n\n<$B> \n\nI think two years maximum\n\n\nI did ask Christine and said not two years\n\n\nI think it's fair otherwise if you accumulate you get\n\n<$A> \n\nUh practical\n\n<$B> \n\nEighty-four days\n\n\nWhat are you gonna do with eighty-four days\n\n\nI don't want to carry\n\n<$A> \n\nOh I would love to go away for eighty-four days\n\n<$B> \n\nEighty-four days\n\n<$A> \n\nBut I don't think University can spare\n\n\nWell run will be maybe two months three two and a half three\nmonths ya\n\n<$B> \n\nI would rather have more frequent breaks and I can relax my\nmind rather than have a long you know break and you feel sometimes it can\nfeel bored with too long a break don't you\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't know I'm I always find things to do\n\n<$B> \n\nOh because your children are there waiting for mummy to take\nher leave\n\n<$A> \n\nYes during their vacation time\n\n\nYesterday I went to a wedding dinner at the Changi Golf Club\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nBeautiful area you know and apparently this restaurant is\nopened to the public\n\n\nI didn't know that\n\n\nI thought was only\n\n<$B> \n\nWas it was it an open air restaurant\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no but it had lovely high ceilings and it was facing the\nsea and the islands\n\n\nAnd then my my my friend I mean it was his wedding dinner and then\nhe had only two tables of close friends you know and then he said oh look at\nthat island \n\n\nHave you been to this island\n\n\nIt's called Wuming island island without a name\n\n\nI said no I haven't been\n\n<$B> \n\nWuming\n\n<$A> \n\nOh have you heard of it\n\n\nIs it Pulau Tekong\n\n<$B> \n\nIn Singapore\n\n<$A> \n\nIs it Pulau Tekong\n\n\nCause I said I I\n\n<$B> \n\nPulau Pulau Tekong is still Pulau Tekong\n\n<$A> \n\nYa he said Wuming and then I said\n\n<$B> \n\nWuming sounds so Chinese\n\n<$A> \n\nYa maybe then I said no I haven't been to that island\n\n\nI didn't know it had that name that means it had no name\n\n\nAnyway I I had I tried to excuse myself by saying I had always\nbeen bad in Geography\n\n<$B> \n\nBlame your Geography teacher\n\n<$A> \n\nOh yes I have nightmares about my Geography test still\n\n<$B> \n\nDo you know what happen to me when I was sitting for an O\nlevel\n\n\nI never liked History because of the teacher\n\n\nShe really killed my interest in History and as a result I had F\nnine for History\n\n\nBut I could afford to fail in that in that subject because I had\nextra subjects\n\n\nSo I concentrated in my other subjects and I just didn't bother\nabout History\n\n\nI just hated it\n\n\nSo a teacher is so important in the sense that they can motivate\nyou or really kill your interest\n\n<$A> \n\nThat's true\n\n\nThat's why I mean we as teachers here too you know it's it's\nreally important how we how we teach the student and you know\n\n\nIt's not so much well what we say is important too but really how\nwe transmit that knowledge\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nMy students my Science students are telling me that some of\nthe now I know the teachers that they have are not the excellent teachers you\nknow they they are good in their own field but they they don't know how to to\ncommunicate their knowledge to their students\n\n\nAnd to to be a you know to be a good researcher for example it's\nquite different from being a good teacher\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd most of them they say are boring in the sense that they\nonly know how to explain how to get the solution or the answer on the\nblackboard and nothing else because it they they won't bother to crack a joke\nwith you or say anything more besides how to get the answer or a formula\n\n<$A> \n\nYa and I think and the the technique the pedagogy you know\nthe the teaching technique is quite weak\n\n\nThey are they're over using transparencies the overhead projector\nand they're making love to the transparencies\n\n\nYou know they really look you know they don't there's no eye\ncontact with the students no question or answer time and it's you know it's a\nsome of them mumble to themselves and are really bad\n\n<$B> \n\nI know and uh I I think I read somewhere that there are\nworkshops organised for uh lecturers or tutors who have had no teaching\nskills as such\n\n<$A> \n\nNo we have something here in the University the you know we\nhave a pre you know before we start\n\n<$B> \n\nI went\n\n<$A> \n\nDid you go for that\n\n<$B> \n\nI attended one on uh tutorial strategies just you know a few\nweeks ago\n\n\nIt was quite good\n\n<$A> \n\nNot that one\n\n\nI think all new expatriate staff who come in they are supposed to\ngo for this briefing\n\n\nI mean this uh brief course and how to cope with students you\nknow in the Singapore context because in tutorials I think you know our\nstudents are very quiet here They they they very shy they feel very\ninadequate and rather intimidated So they tend not to speak not to ask\nquestions and you know it becomes more like a class session whether they they\nexpect the lecturer to speak and to give them answers to questions\n\n<$B> \n\nI think most of them are very passive Even the when our\nstudents go abroad you see the the the difference between our Asian students\ncompared to those you know Caucasians they would talk talk talk but sometime\nit can be empty talk but they will still talk\n\n<$A> \n\nYa that's what they call hogging air space", "subdomain":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nI mean knew I would never be able to develop professionally in\nthat place for various reasons you know\n\n\nIt may be defamatory to name them\n\n\nSo I went and applied and I got a job with David Chong and company\nuh David Chong <unclear> word </unclear> and partners who were interested in\nmy I P practice and there I continued with whatever I P work I had\n\n\nAnd uhm I I did uh one or two interesting cases like this copyright\ninfringement case various aspects of which have been reported in the papers\nand oh by the way I had some of my raids and all that reported in the papers\nyou know\n\n\nI'll show you the newspaper clippings\n\n\nAnd then and then I so so I got involved in registration copyright\nyou know some documentation and all that and when I applied to this firm I\ncame in hoping to develop my I P practice\n\n\nSo basically that was how it went\n\n<$B> \n\nRight so uhm you went from this small firm to David Chong where\nyou also did I P work and\n\n<$A> \n\nYah yah\n\n\nBut now we're here and we both of us have to try and develop the I\nP practice with our practice head coordinator\n\n<$B> \n\nYes certainly we should try\n\n<$A> \n\nWe shall do our best\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd yourself Vasantha\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat would you like to know\n\n\nMy years at Smith Kline\n\n<$A> \n\nAh\n\n\nYa\n\n\nThat will be interesting\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nAye okay I want to ask you\n\n\nHas uh you you did a lot of marketing but has that uhm deaden your\nsort of diagnostic abilities if you can call it as a pharmacy\n\n\nBecause you know it's different being practising pharmacy as it is\nand actually marketing\n\n<$B> \n\nCertainly what it is is that initially you get trained for a\nprofession but uhm if you don't work within that profession then you can lose\ntouch\n\n\nYou don't lose the training\n\n\nWhat happens is that you may lose some confidence and you may lose\ntouch with the state of the art of the practice but uh it will not take very\nmuch to go back into it\n\n\nI mean you must bear in mind that pharmacy practice is very diverse\n\n\nYou got pharmacist who are actually in pharmacy practice in\nmanufacturing in hospitals in retail and uhm within the pharmaceutical\nindustry\n\n\nThose within that pharmaceutical industry tend to be far more\nbusiness oriented\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd marketing\n\n<$B> \n\nand uh yah business and marketing oriented\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause they're basically businessmen\n\n\nI suppose it's a more fluid degree to have than something like Law\n\n<$B> \n\nIt tends to be quite fluid but uh it it yah I would suppose\nand you can also you've got the scientific training you see so that does I I\nfeel it makes a difference because it it sharpens your mind in\n\n<$A> \n\nAnalytical skills\n\n\nDo you do you think it it it sharpens your skills more than let's\nsay legal training has\n\n<$B> \n\nUh definitely because it's my my scientific training that has\nhelped me to develop my legal skills\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause I felt that with all due respect to Arts graduates I\nfelt that when I was when I was still an Arts student uhm are you finding all\nthis very interesting\n\n\nWhen I was an Arts student I dealt with abstracts you know like\nlike when you do a practical criticism of a article and all that and that has\nhelped\n\n\nEven now let's say when I view a a a movie you can actually look\nand see what the nuances are and I enjoyed doing that\n\n<$B> \n\nBut you see Cecilia the yah yah\n\n<$A> \n\nBut le I mean legal training is very different you know and I\nthink my strong Arts uhm bent affected my ability to switch\n\n\nYou know what I mean\n\n\nBecause you were in Science all along even in school and if there\nis a marked difference\n\n<$B> \n\nYah uhm although I find that the the legal skills that are\nrequired for reasoning and analytical work are very akin to Science except\nthat the Science is\n\n<$A> \n\nIs more precious\n\n<$B> \n\nFar more exacting\n\n\nSo however analytical you could get with your legal skills and your\nlegal practice you will still never reach the stage that you would truth\nscientific of truth scientific uhm work\n\n<$A> \n\nYah you see at the end of the day an an chemistry equation is\na chemistry equation\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's very that's right and it is very exact\n\n\nIt is exact down to the last atom for it to be able to function\nwhereas there's always some amount of leeway in in\n\n<$A> \n\nNo in in legal practice it can never be exact because you're\ndealing with changes circumstances and changing times\n\n<$B> \n\nYah yah so I mean no it's not a question of good or bad it's a\nquestion of the difference\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's a question of the focus yah and it has to be\n\n\nHow much more time do we have Chris\n\n\nNine minutes\n\n\nHey we didn't do too badly yah so what what else do we need to talk\nabout\n\n\nOh you say you haven't been to Sri Lanka that would be interesting\nbecause I as you know I've married a man who's a Singhalese and uhm he is uh\nI think sec perhaps a third generation Singaporean and uhm I I I think that\nAsians nowadays have this dichotomy between them\n\n\nYou know about Asian identity being which is very tied to their\nethnic and racial identity as opposed to national identity and suppose to\ntheir influences cultural influences which we have\n\n\nI mean we're a product of uhm colonial times where uhm the language\nwe speak is actually a language foreign to this region\n\n\nDon't you think so\n\n\nAnd I think so the the the the the information that we absorb\ngenerally will al always be in the English language okay\n\n\nAnd that would mean that the source of this information will also\nbe in a way regional from the West and that does that colour our view or does\nthat actually change our perception of who we are\n\n\nI give you an example like the way we dress okay\n\n\nIs it considered a Western outfit or has it reached the stage where\nit is international\n\n\nBecause when in in Sri Lanka apparently I read that they wanted to\nestablish national identities so they made everybody wear sarongs\n\n\nYou know what I mean\n\n<$B> \n\nOh how strange\n\n<$A> \n\nSo so\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat's the link of sarong with Sri Lanka\n\n\nSarees\n\n<$A> \n\nSarongs\n\n\nYou know they wear the\n\n<$B> \n\nHow strange\n\n\nBut that would be more to establish an identity in Malaysia\n\n<$A> \n\nNo but I suppose they they have they tie something round their\nbut\n\n<$B> \n\nLike like dhotis\n\n<$A> \n\nDhotis perhaps it's called dotees\n\n\nSo so do they're saying that wearing pants and wearing skirts and\nblouses is a Western con\n\n<$B> \n\nReinforces the Western influence\n\n<$A> \n\nYah yah but does it\n\n\nBecause if you if you look at it if you look at even England or or\nEurope and all that not everybody dress in jeans and shirts\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I think you have a good point there\n\n\nYou see the question about all this has got to do with whether\nwhich stage the development of the country is at and to what degree the\ngovernment and the people and the influences of that country choose to view\nculture and and uhm harmony and identity as a priority\n\n\nI think in this current economic climate uh a lot of governments\nmake the conscious decision that economic factors especially in these times\nof recession are far more important\n\n\nWhen there's not enough accordance given to cultural aspects then\nwhat tends to happen is that well people muddle along\n\n\nThey find their own way and the economic policies override\n\n\nAnd when the economic policies override your Western influences\ncome in because you got your your your your yah\n\n<$A> \n\nYour media\n\n\nYour investments\n\n<$B> \n\nYou got your the countries from which you're gonna be able to\nuh get the trade and give you know import export\n\n\nSo very interestingly now that the Western world has opened up so\nmuch to the East you'll find that equally be you know they've they've come to\nthe East for economic purposes\n\n\nYou look at how England the United States Australia everybody is\nlooking at wow the China market the Vietnam market the Cambodia market you\nknow and the Indian market\n\n\nLook suddenly Singapore who started going off and looking at all\nthese wonderful potential things they could milk from there\n\n\nBut Singapore is different\n\n\nSingapore is still in Asia\n\n\nBut when it comes to when the other countries start uhm looking\ntowards Asia then uhm the economic factors bring in the cultural factors as\nwell and then people start to see\n\n<$A> \n\nDo you think it's it's it's so it's could it be economically\ndriven\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's not I'm not saying I mean it's seem to be economically\ndriven uh whether the governments give emphasis to cultural things\n\n\nYou see once you reached a certain level of of uh\n\n<$A> \n\nAffluence\n\n<$B> \n\nAffluence then you start to look at things like my identity\nself-actualization\n\n<$A> \n\nSort of the finer things in life\n\n<$B> \n\nCorrect whereas\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause it's gone beyond basic survival\n\n<$B> \n\nYes whereas if you go to places like India okay every once in\na while you have this little thing where a cultural thing will arise and\npeople will say and anyway the the cultural influences are still very strong\npeople still have an identity because ninety-five per cent of the population\nis a certain race you know\n\n\nBut the thing is like in India for example where there's been so\nmuch Western influence and the government had said that there has been but at\nthe same time the government is also so much more interested in the economics\nof it in developing and you have to because how do you reach a stage where\nyou can say that oh my G D P is this much my per capita income is so much\nexcept by improving economically\n\n\nAs you know so it's a question of the priority that the country\ngives to it\n\n<$A> \n\nThat that is one way of looking at it\n\n\nBut if you look at it from a historical point of view\n\n\nLet's say you it it it who in this century all right let's say the\nlast two centuries which are the strong economic powers\n\n\nThe Westerns\n\n\nYou know during the colonial times it was Europe\n\n\nIt was England you know the great British empire and then in the\nlater part of this century aft especially after World War Two it was America\n\n<$B> \n\nYah\n\n<$A> \n\nRight so where where where economic strength lies political\nstrength lies with it exert a lot of cultural influence as well\n\n\nYou know what I mean\n\n\nLike for instance uhm take five hundred years ago they talk about\nIndianisation of this region\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nBecause India was so powerful that that there was a lot of trade\ndone in this region through India and India had a way of uh influencing the\nthe religion and the culture so\n\n<$B> \n\nSo it is the economic factors which are the driving force if\nif\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause comes comes economic power then political power\n\n<$B> \n\nI agree with you\n\n\nI mean I I think essentially that's that's we've agreed on that\nbecause it's not that uh the government decides that the cultural if the\ncultural aspects are going in the opposite direction to the economic aspects\n\n\nI think the economic aspects will overtake yah\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then now we have and then and then of course there was\nChina\n\n\nSo if you look at let's say a country like Thailand and Indonesia\nI mean they're actually quite diverse but at at the same time if you look at\nthe way their script is done the way their dances are and also like their\nreligion and all that it's very much influenced by the philosophies of India\n\n\nThen again you to the other extreme\n\n<$B> \n\nWell our our pinico is based on the Indian pinico \n\n<$A> \n\nYah but that is I'm talking about over the centuries okay\nNow I think India's influence because right now India is not as influential\nas when she was lets say two three hundred years ago\n\n<$B> \n\nYes yes\n\n<$A> \n\nBefore the British came and milked it\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's right\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know uhm it has its influence is less strong in this\nregion Then take China also during China's uh during the times when they were\nvery powerful during the Ming Dynasty during the the beginning of the Ching\nDynasty The influence they had over Japan over Korea you know what I mean\nthere's there's there's a general cultural slant that

{"text": "<$A> \n\nOh and then and besides that I plan training courses for the\nstaff as well\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat sort of training courses do you are you talking about\n\n<$A> \n\nOh things like more of computer related lah\n\n\nThings like Word Perfect uhm Lotus\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know how\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't think you are that familiar with it\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know how to operate Word Perfect\n\n<$A> \n\nOf course I'm very good at it okay\n\n\nIt's time for you to learn\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay so uh besides this what else do you do\n\n<$A> \n\nWell I just started so basically these are my two main\nportfolios\n\n<$B> \n\nHow how do you rate your uh working environment\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's very good\n\n\nUhm everybody there is very helpful to one another and we we click\nalong\n\n<$B> \n\nOh and uh where do you usually have lunch\n\n\nIs it very crowded\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm we usually buy back and we watch videos\n\n\nYah like the latest one we just finished watching Jurassic Park\n\n<$B> \n\nOn a video\n\n<$A> \n\nOn a video yes\n\n<$B> \n\nWould wouldn't that take away a lot of the fun\n\n\nBut you have seen Jurassic Park before right\n\n<$A> \n\nNo yes I've seen that's why I this is second time round\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nYes so what about you\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat have I been doing\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nOh I basically I've been just watching watching movies and\ngoing shopping and uh\n\n<$A> \n\nBought a lot of things\n\n<$B> \n\nYah I bought a lot of things\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nSo uh I've seen In the line of Fire\n\n<$A> \n\nAye tell me what is it\n\n<$B> \n\nThis one good\n\n\nYou know all this\n\n\nThis okay is like you know Clint Eastwood right\n\n\nSo it's about this guy who is a retired no he's not retired he's a\nhe's a very old F B I agent so\n\n<$A> \n\nIs he still working now or\n\n<$B> \n\nHe's working but the first time uhm he was suppose to protect\nuh J F K when he was shot you see and somehow when when he heard the shot\nright he couldn't react in time you see\n\n\nSo this time ha there's a there's this uhm this this man who wants\nto assassinate the president you know and he calls this Clint Eastwood up you\nsee and carries on this cat and mouse\n\n<$A> \n\nChase\n\n<$B> \n\nChase\n\n\nSpeak to him over the phone\n\n\nAt the time he would leave some clues so it's that he will bring\nthe police quite nearly and at the end he will always keep one step ahead\n\n\nSo the whole story is about how uhm I mean yah lah the typical\n\n<$A> \n\nSo how he finally he solve the case\n\n<$B> \n\nBut the thing thing about the show is there's are a lot of uhm\ncharacterisation so\n\n<$A> \n\nLike\n\n<$B> \n\nIn terms of the characters lah\n\n\nYou feel like very real you know\n\n\nIt's not like some Rambo style or Fugitive\n\n\nYou have this super super edition man running around and all this\ngetting ahead of their you know\n\n<$A> \n\nSo it's like more realistic than\n\n<$B> \n\nYah this is more realistic and the people are more real you\nsee\n\n\nThey've more depth to the character and uh yah\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay the other show I saw was Dave\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's also about about this man who uhm who was to look like\nthe president you see\n\n\nSo while he was used as a stand in for the president when the\npresident goes into the public so instead of the president going to public he\ngo into public\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause uh just prevent the president from being shot or or\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nBut what happens is uh in the end the president died you see\nof a heart attack\n\n<$A> \n\nSo he has to continue to put up\n\n<$B> \n\nOh he died of he died of a stroke while having an affair with\nhis secretary\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nSo what happen is the the the Chief-Of-Staff right keep the\nimpostor in as he would control him you know\n\n<$A> \n\nYes yah yah\n\n<$B> \n\nSo the story goes lah\n\n\nBoth of the both of the films sort of like make it sort of like\nsymbolises the American's disillusionment with the government\n\n<$A> \n\nPresident\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause they always portray the government officials as\nbureacratics or just just for their own gains and for their own selfish uh\nown\n\n<$A> \n\nBut it's quite difficult right actually\n\n<$B> \n\nSo and usually portray them as uh you know the president is\nalways portrayed as a useless person you see and the good guys are always the\nthe everyday guy you know the <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nYes so so yes\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay so now the fun thing is have you bought your Telecom\nshares\n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nAt least\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay at least the group B\n\n<$B> \n\nI apply for the group B shares but I haven't applied for the A\nshares\n\n<$A> \n\nBut A shares\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause first of all I didn't apply for the first time so I\ndidn't get the two hundred dollars more the extra two hundred dollars\n\n<$A> \n\nBut they can\n\n\nCan't you top up have it topped up\n\n<$B> \n\nI was so lazy and then I was I just didn't want to top up\n\n<$A> \n\nThere's no queue now you better go\n\n\nThursday is the closing date I think\n\n<$B> \n\nThursday for the topping up C P F\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't know I think\n\n<$B> \n\nBut they have to send you send me the blue the blue form and I\nhave to send back\n\n<$A> \n\nDid they send you in the first place\n\n<$B> \n\nNo I never had because my C P F is not I don't have a C P F\naccount\n\n<$A> \n\nYa how come didn't go and top up\n\n<$B> \n\nIs it\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nOh must top up meh\n\n\nBut I was thinking you put one thousand over dollars into the C P F\njust to put put it there I think it's quite silly right\n\n<$A> \n\nThen you can sell it when the thing is listed lah\n\n<$B> \n\nI feeling I'm being part of the mad rush of the foolish\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nYou are so free now you might as well spend sometime

Danny\n\n<$A> \n\nDanny\n\n<$B> \n\nRight\n\n\nIf you come across uh if you come across a a lot of rhyming words\nyou you know\n\n<$A> \n\nThen it's Daniel\n\n<$B> \n\nThen it's Daniel\n\n<$A> \n\nThe

like money does\nnot make us happier it'll only make us more difficult to be happier then you\nknow it's\n\n<$A> \n\nPastor David\n\n<$B> \n\nPastor David\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nSo when are we going to have our dinner\n\n<$B> \n\nOh the Sheraton food thing is it\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n\nHave I told you about the Sheraton food\n\n<$A> \n\nNo you have not\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n\nWhat am I talking all the time\n\n\nWhy don't you tell me something about\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy\n\n\nYou told me about the Sheraton food what\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay what happen at at this place is we go Sheraton and we\nordered this uh set dinner you see\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd the set dinner is uh consists of it's a total of\nthirty-seven dollars plus plus and you can order anything from the main menu\nright and some of the very very uh expensive things you can order are salmon\nuh appetisers or uh or oysters and they're very very large fresh oysters\n\n<$A> \n\nLarge servings\n\n<$B> \n\nLarge servings\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nYou can you can also order things like the steak which cost\nalmost thirty-seven dollars a meal\n\n<$A> \n\nFor that price\n\n<$B> \n\nYah\n\n<$A> \n\nThat means it's this one lah from the menu lah\n\n<$B> \n\nSo other things include the very famous ice-cream <unclear>\nword </unclear> and uh you basically eat a lot you see and the service is\nvery good\n\n\nBut of course you must willing to pay almost forty over forty\ndollars because it's about thirty-seven plus plus plus plus plus plus\n\n<$A> \n\nPlus plus lah the taxes\n\n<$B> \n\nYah\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nSo uhm yah do you shop\n\n<$A> \n\nYes I usually shop during weekends\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd where do you go\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm my favourite place Tangs\n\n\nI used to go to Studio as well but ever since uhm it was it has\nbeen shifted to Takashimaya the things there are more marked up-market so I\nfor me I still go there but I don't usually I don't get a lot of things there\nanymore\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat is the link\n\n\nYou know as a\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat what link\n\n<$B> \n\nThere's this shop called the Link part of the Link\n\n\nIs it part of this a chain of shops or what with Takashimaya\n\n<$A> \n\nTakashimaya\n\n\nI'm not sure\n\n\nDo you know\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know\n\n<$A> \n\nI also don't know\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause the other the other day I went with my friends and he\nwas looking for this this shoe called what hah Doc Marten is it\n\n<$A> \n\nOh I I heard of it\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know those shoes that is it's usually black ones\n\n<$A> \n\nYah yah yah\n\n<$B> \n\nThen it's very shiny one with very thick rubber soles you\nknow and uh something that everybody else is wearing you know\n\n<$A> \n\nYah but I don't\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's not very nice right\n\n<$A> \n\nIt looks so\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's just It looks in nah but it's very boring you see\n\n<$A> \n\nYah yah\n\n<$B> \n\nRight\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't think I'll like that kind of thing\n\n\nSo probably I'll yah I've more time of shopping\n\n<$B> \n\nI think nowadays people shouldn't dress like the mainstream\npeople\n\n<$A> \n\nBut now\n\n<$B> \n\nThey want to be trendy so called\n\n<$A> \n\nIs is yah but the the funny thing is the trend is to dress\n\n<$B> \n\nLike mainstream people\n\n<$A> \n\nYah that kind\n\n<$B> \n\nNo but that's that that is what trend is all the time what\nbut \n\n<$B> \n\nWhat what do you think is a average uh person's idea of what\na good life is\n\n<$A> \n\nAverage person\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm like youself\n\n<$A> \n\nVery funny\n\n\nOkay good life\n\n\nI think for us it's a bit different lah\n\n\nI think I'll I'll speak of average the average person\n\n\nBasically the five Cs\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat are the five Cs\n\n<$A> \n\nA car a credit card condominium I can't remember what else\n\n<$B> \n\nCash\n\n<$A> \n\nCash\n\n\nCash and what\n\n\nA career children\n\n<$B> \n\nAh children children\n\n<$A> \n\nYah I don't think it's cash lah credit card included already\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay I think uh I think maybe what do you think\n\n<$A> \n\nSo maybe they'll work for it\n\n\nSo sometimes it's at the expense of their personal life or even\ntheir family life because they're so busy building up their career\n\n<$B> \n\nSo it's basically credit card car and condominium lah\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd uh club membership\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nAs well as uh maybe yah cash lah cash and credit card\n\n<$A> \n\nYah I mean because these things are like uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat people think still happy <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nThey happy\n\n\nNot really because they find that it's an achievement\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy is it that people wants to uhm buy expensive things\n\n\nOr you know lah maybe\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay you usually they buy\n\n<$B> \n\nOr maybe have you ever felt that that the great sensation\nwhen you walked into the shop and you just pick something up without having\nto make sure you run through the whole town and look for the cheapest deal\n\n<$A> \n\nSo far I have I do not have that courage to do yet\n\n<$B> \n\nI see\n\n<$A> \n\nHave you\n\n\nYou must have\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I have\n\n\nI made a big mistake\n\n\nI went to this shop and then I saw something that I like and I\njust took it and I paid for it you see\n\n<$A> \n\nReally\n\n<$B> \n\nSo that normally what what people like us the average Jone do\nis you know you find something you like and then you go and hunt down from\none end to the other end of \n\n<$A> \n\nYes usually that's what I do\n\n<$B> \n\nTo look for the cheapest deal",

{"text": "<$A> \n\nAye so how\n\n\nHow did you find the video lecture just now\n\n<$B> \n\nOh that one\n\n\nIt's very interesting\n\n\nUh I find that I learn a lot from uh the sharing of the of the\nteacher and\n\n<$A> \n\nBut what what I mean did did your lecturer sort of uh like ask\nyou all what do you think about tape video lecture\n\n\nI mean was it was it like uh you know like our lecturer she told us\nI mean she asked views from the other pupils and they were saying that oh it\nwas rather boring\n\n\nI mean she wasn't motivating the teachers\n\n<$B> \n\nOh I think he got\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd motivating the the people who are listening to her and and\nuhm which is going against what she was preaching because she was actually\nsupposed to\n\n<$B> \n\nMotivate instead she ya\n\n<$A> \n\nMotivate the students and failed I mean to talk about uhm\nsinking you see\n\n\nSo that's what the comments were lah\n\n\nSo what what did your lecturer say\n\n<$B> \n\nIn in fact uhm she didn't comment on the video\n\n<$A> \n\nThen she went on straight on\n\n<$B> \n\nShe went on to our activities just now\n\n<$A> \n\nThere was an activity\n\n<$B> \n\nThere there there was\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no lecture\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm we we have the activity lah yah because we have to so much\ntime anyway only about half an hour\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know why because our lecturer was saying that uhm he said\nmost of the time uh the local Singaporean uh students they are always uh\nremember she said in one of her lecture she said they are impress by those\nthose lect those lecturers who uh who can entertain them\n\n<$B> \n\nEntertain\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd over and above you know the the content of his lectures so\nshe says this is this one of the reasons uh why because uh she said you you\ncan rest assured that this is one of the uh this these these are the kind of\nlectures that you can expect if you go overseas uh lectures and they do not\ntake so much you know not like Singapore lecturers\n\n\nThey pay more attention to their uh presentation especially with an\noverhead project uh O H transparencies\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's what I mean\n\n\nWe you have to listen to the content content to really pick up the\ninteresting thing\n\n\nI mean you can't uh really uhm focus on the visuals to depend on\nthe videos to stimulate you\n\n\nAlthough that that that played a big part in in motivating you to\nlisten but I think for us we have to be trained <unclear> word </unclear>\nmotivated in no matter where how it's presented as long as the content is\ngood\n\n<$A> \n\nYah exactly\n\n\nI I mean there's that's way I I felt that the person who brought\nthis issue out was rather childish\n\n\nI would say to think to I mean to think that we need to be\nentertained in order to have uh lecture properly conducted that sort of thing\nbecause I felt that the content was what matters and it was really uhm uhm\nsomething that you know is she made use of materials that were easily\nobtainable daily life and newspapers and all that and I don't think you need\nto really entertain\n\n\nOf course that will help but I think what what it boils to is uh\nyourself lah because we're talking about high-level students here\n\n\nWe're not talking about uhm lower level students uh I mean\n\n<$B> \n\nWe're suppose to be high-level thinkers yah\n\n<$A> \n\nYah they should think beyond just entertainment value and all\nthat because I thought that that I was actually rather disappointed that they\nstopped the film halfway because I was just you know she was just getting\ninto the uhm crucial part of it which is uhm you know ideas for activities\n\n\nAnd I think we need to know about uhm what what what are the\ndifferent views different ideas they have\n\n\nBecause I think if we are to just limit ourselves to what we can uh\namongst you know the Asian context and all that then we are not we're being\nvery closed to new ideas\n\n\nWe shouldn't think about it that way\n\n\nSo it's rather strange that that person should bring it up and say\nnow and then that it's so boring\n\n\nBut I think a lot of the students were not really paying attention\nto the content uh\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd how does how did uh Agnes Chang react to that\n\n<$A> \n\nOh yah that's what that's what she said\n\n\nShe said there are sadly to say a lot of the local students think\nthat uhm entertainment comes before content you know uh and unfortunately she\nsays a lot the local lecturers uhm content wise is very strong uh\nentertaining wise is not as strong so we have to look beyond that especially\nyou know if you see yourself as a high-level students\n\n\nI would think that uh I mean it is so shallow to say that\nentertainment value comes before content\n\n\nI mean it would be fine\n\n\nI mean it would be a bonus if we get a person who can entertainment\nas well as to give us solid content\n\n\nBecause according to to her she says that uh she has once come I\nmean she she says that the very bright students will straight away know\n\n\nUh whether you are just playing time by your entertaining and\nwithholding all your content or you have no content to provide\n\n\nThat's why you are doing all the entertaining all the time\n\n\nUhm and compare this lecturer with another lecturer who's really\nboring but he's giving you a lot of uh content material in terms of the topic\nso she <unclear> word </unclear> anything\n\n<$B> \n\nSo the probably the student is not exercising her critical\nthinking anymore because if she's looking for that alone and and not on the\ncontent what is there to be what is there to develop in terms of the critical\nthinking part\n\n<$A> \n\nYah because I think perhaps maybe one one one of the thing is\nthe venue in which they have uhm telecast\n\n\nI mean they have uh tape video on because the screen is rather tiny\nand and\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd those uh thing projected on the wall\n\n<$A> \n\nO H P\n\n<$B> \n\nOn the screen is not well seen\n\n<$A> \n\nCannot be seen\n\n\nI I do not know whether that is whether I mean but I think one\nthing also they should have probably uhm give us a more focussed directed us\nto a more focussed what why why they're showing this video to us and at least\ngive us some leeway <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nThings to look out for\n\n<$A> \n\nYah to look out for exactly because I mean it's this this\nvideo screening was like a lecture instead of a lecture with a live person\n\n\nIt's lecture over the video\n\n\nBut uh here we are in this small screen trying very hard to look at\nthe the notes on the screen uhm so that maybe <unclear> word </unclear>\nprobably they get a bit discouraged from that\n\n\nBut I think uh the summary was good the summary she gave yah she\ngave one of the I mean one of the lecturers giving uh one of the summary at\nthe end\n\n\nI mean at least it helps us\n\n\nYah this is actually what we were we were looking at but uhm it was\nlike a bit too late if you missed it\n\n<$B> \n\nBut it's quite but I felt the summary is a bit brief in a\nsense that I thought she I thought she taught <unclear> word </unclear> more\nthan what she has summarised\n\n<$A> \n\nOh of course she did\n\n\nI mean like there was one section on uhm what you call\nmeaning-centred uh motivate meaning-centred programme or approach uhm which\nshe hardly ever touched which she <unclear> word </unclear> hardly ever\ntouched on it\n\n\nBut I think she guess she treat us uh like what high-level adults\nand uh probably assumed a lot\n\n\nOr she may have thought that what is written on the screen wasn't\nuhm that important uhm probably more important is the fact that you know we\nlistened to uhm what she has the the person in the video has to share\n\n<$B> \n\nThat means that uh she expected us to get more get down more\npoints than what she has summarised\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I think her summary\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's just to confirm what we have summarised\n\n<$A> \n\nYes more yes that's right\n\n\nIt's used to confirm and like we have listened yah what we have\nwritten down\n\n\nI think her summary was written there and then\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I think so like I saw her doing something just now\n\n<$A> \n\nRight\n\n\nShe was she was scribbling on\n\n\nYah so I don't know but so what what what did your lecturer do\nafter the screening\n\n<$B> \n\nOh we have a very interesting discussion about left-handers\nand right-hander\n\n\nYah and it sort of confirm that I'm really a left-hander\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause because she was uh stressing on the part that uhm that\nthe left-hander they they are more creative although I I don't think I'm that\ncreative but uh some aspect of how I how I exercise my thinking seems to fall\nin with what she said\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd what is that\n\n<$B> \n\nLike for example I sometimes uh I tend to be more stimulated\nby visual presentation than verbal one and when come to problem-solving maybe\nI depend more on images than uh\n\n<$A> \n\nYou mean\n\n<$B> \n\nWritten words\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay you mean you mean if you were given a mathematical\nproblem you will actually uh draw the diagrams and then\n\n<$B> \n\nOf course because a lot of problems cannot depend on images\nand pictures to diagrams to to be to solve but I guess that's because of our\ntraining in in schools that's why we don't we don't become that sort of\nproblem-solver\n\n\nBut I think uh for me I find that diagrams helps helps a lot if if\nI'm to solve a problem\n\n\nI find that it it really help me to be focussed on a problem\n\n\nWe really understand how how to go about solving a problem\n\n\nUh and what's the other interesting point\n\n\nUhm and also when I look at things I think I I adopt I adopt a more\na holistic view than you know uh than analytical view on things\n\n<$A> \n\nOh what do you mean\n\n\nYou mean you look at whole things rather than in parts\n\n<$B> \n\nThings on a whole yah than its part\n\n\nSo I guess I'm more I'm better in synthesising things than\nanalysing so when come to analysing problem I'm quite poor I think\n\n\nBut when it come to synthesising a lot of things that I've learnt\nI think I better at it\n\n\nThat's why I I really like uhm Doctor Tan Tai Wei's because he's\nvery philosophical and people who are philosophical actually look at things\non a whole\n\n<$A> \n\nWhole yah more holistic\n\n<$B> \n\nYah so\n\n<$A> \n\nDid you oh you didn't read an article\n\n\nThere there was this uhm actually article that was uh given to us\nin mathematical mathematical class and uhm based on what you call why are\nstudents not using the visual uhm uh using visual uh diagrams to help them in\nsolving in problem-solving\n\n\nAnd uhm basically uh what they are trying to say is that uh you\nknow because diagrammatically wise it's probably easy\n\n\nYou can straight away uhm see the solution rather than working it\nby you know Algorithms you know or or by certain steps which we were taught\nin school\n\n\nSo the question posted was you know why why are teachers not using\nmore visual diagrams to help in problem-solving and then basically they came\nup with uh several reasons\n\n\nThe first one of course being that the teachers themselves were\nnot trained uhm uhm to visually solve the problem and then uh because they\nactually did an experiment in the American University where uh some very\nsimple actually problems that were given to students and they were expected\nbecause they were actually taught uh they were actually the Algorithms of uh\nsolving this problems", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6217a516-42d9-42eb-bd18-3c711909fb57", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.478638+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nIt was fun right Doctor Low's I mean uhm Miss Low's\n\n<$B> \n\nMrs Low's class\n\n<$A> \n\nMrs Low's class yes yes\n\n\nI I really miss the you know her uhm her style of teaching\n\n\nI really enjoy her tutorials so much you know and together with Pee\nZa we had so much fun then uhm and Siang Ling also\n\n\nWe used to be uhm actually I I we knew her style is uhm you know she\nactually wanted to separate us you see\n\n\nSo we tried to stick together\n\n<$B> \n\nOh yah I guess it's more comfortable with people you know but I\nI like the classes because she tries to give an example of what she wants us\nto be when actually teaching\n\n\nNot like the others because I find some of them do uhm fail to\npractise what they preach\n\n\nAh well with all due respect to them\n\n\nBut somehow I wish those those lecturers in N U S went through this\ncourse\n\n<$A> \n\nAh yes\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause I I think there're a lot of mechanics they ought to\nknow right how to uhm manage the O H T uhm a lot of other classroom mechanics\nwhich I thought would be helpful to them because now I'm looking back I felt\nfind a lot of lecturers and tutors don't really know how to control a class\nand how to read the faces of pupils of of the students in in university\n\n\nBecause sometimes I just don't understand a lesson and I find uhm\nI'm really communicating with the tutor\n\n\nYou know he's supposed to make sure I understand my work\n\n<$A> \n\nOh yah\n\n<$B> \n\nSo I find uhm N U S tutors senior tutors and lecturers should\nundergo some form of training to prepare them to impart their knowledge but\nnot just go straight into it after their qualifications or whatever\n\n<$A> \n\nOh yes I think now they might have this course going on\nbecause that day I I was in the library N I E library\n\n\nThen I saw this publication you know that says uh they have\nactually trained uh uh trained a batch of N U S lecturers and the poly the\npoly one polytechnic lecturers to undergo this course\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd to go back and then and share what they've learnt\n\n<$A> \n\nUh well it's course on uhm teaching them uhm you know teaching\ntechniques or lecturing techniques\n\n<$B> \n\nI see I see oh I'm worried about that\n\n<$A> \n\nYah it's a kind of a small group uh\n\n\nI think probably only those new newer ones will get to try\n\n\nProbably the more senior ones maybe they\n\n<$B> \n\nYah it won't be very nice to get them <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nSo I think they're having it currently\n\n\nBut you you'd be surprise\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I still don't think that's enough\n\n\nI I find everybody has to go through it not just uhm a selected few\n\n<$A> \n\nOh yah I think so too\n\n<$B> \n\nWell anyway\n\n<$A> \n\nProbably they will would have spared us all the lessons you\nknow always of uh trying to find out what they're uh saying\n\n<$B> \n\nYah anyhow but I'm enjoying this course so far lah\n\n\nHow about yourself\n\n<$A> \n\nYah I'm enjoying myself but then\n\n<$B> \n\nNot that not that I'm learning a lot\n\n\nIt's like sometimes I I just sit through it for the sake of sitting\nthrough it but on ocassionally I think about a quarter out of all times I do\nfind I learn something new\n\n<$A> \n\nYes yes yes\n\n<$B> \n\nA technique that I can uhm you know\n\n<$A> \n\nUse\n\n<$B> \n\nShare\n\n\nUh something wholesome\n\n<$A> \n\nYes but I actually personally speaking I prefer that uh that\nsmall uhm direction from we ourselves rather than direction from lecturers\n\n\nSay for instance uhm maybe in fact for myself I'm interested in\ntransactional analysis so I really hope that I mean with the our kind of\ncurriculum we have uh is so heavy I I I just have to devote more time to\ndoing my actual school work rather than reading all this kind of things\n\n\nI mean things that really interest me you see like aspects of\npsychology in this area transactional analysis that actually\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then again if everybody does that there won't be uhm\nenough time to tell you what you have to know\n\n<$A> \n\nYah but I think actually frankly speaking it's very uhm\ninteresting you know\n\n\nIt's really good for teaching I mean besides uh pedagogical wise\nand learning classroom management everything\n\n\nI mean all all these we're like learning now I think having a\nreally good knowledge uh the psychologically makeup of people is very\nimportant\n\n\nThat's what I think\n\n\nBecause I have been reading this book by Eric Burn you know called\nGames People Play\n\n\nI think it's very good you know\n\n\nI do not understand why it's not incorporated of\n\n<$B> \n\nSome kind of debonal kind of thing critical thinking\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's not only debonal uh critically thinking kind of thing uhm\nbut it's more of uhm analysis into why people engage in their dysfunctional\nbehaviour and this\n\n<$B> \n\nLike <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nYes uh is it will help in like uh handling uh deviance\nstudents or students with problems you know\n\n\nI mean classroom management all the while\n\n\nAre you in classroom management course\n\n<$B> \n\nNo I didn't pick that because I don't know I I guess I like\nsemi-factual things than rather than uhm actual actually dealing with people\n\n\nBecause I'm I my own strength is not very much in dealing with\npeople\n\n\nDon't ask me why I'm teaching\n\n\nBut yah when I took the rizac <unclear> word </unclear> test uhm\nwhen we're talking about career development I I'm social skill is not of my\nforte\n\n\nIt wasn't wasn't any things that I was good in\n\n\nYah so and when teacher ask us to share you know our our conclusion\nof of analysis of ourselves I was quite feeling quite sheepish about it\nbecause I didn't have you know social that that letter S\n\n<$A> \n\nI had artistic and then the other was uhm investigative and I\ncan't I think enterprising\n\n<$B> \n\nOh oh oh\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd that was it\n\n\nBut it takes all sorts of people to make the world\n\n\nIt doesn't mean uh\n\n<$B> \n\nYah right\n\n\nThat's why I that how I I saw it\n\n<$A> \n\nYah\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd sometimes you may not know yourself as well as other\npeople know you\n\n\nLike I I keep telling my husband I'm not good with people\n\n\nYou're better\n\n\nI'm more task-oriented\n\n\nYou're better with people so you go do the talking\n\n\nBut he he'll tell me hey no just give it a shot\n\n\nI think your you can put yourself across quite well and you have a\nlistening ear\n\n\nSo I I just did it and sometimes I find myself doing quite a good\njob you know when people have problems and they come to me\n\n\nSo many years I think you do have that kind of uhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nMaybe just that I don't see it myself\n\n<$B> \n\nCalm uh very calm cool uh kind of mannerisms and I think it's\ngood in that sense\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't think it being a teacher means uhm you really have to\nbe very social and outgoing\n\n<$B> \n\nYah like say we have a keep a distance also so I I think maybe\nuh this coldness or what you call it will help me\n\n\nBecause I I do find some of my friends becoming very close friends\nwith their students and I don't know if that's very healthy\n\n<$A> \n\nYah\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I I find myself quite comfortable teaching especially\nlike when I'm interacting with the people\n\n\nI'm giving tuition and so sometimes I I feel like I'm not sharing\nenough like I'm not uhm communicative enough interacting enough with them to\nbuild a good rapport\n\n\nThen again when I look back uhm I'm doing my job in helping them\nimprove their language skill so uhm what what more do I want you see and they\ncan relate with relate relate to me very well\n\n\nThey feel comfortable with me\n\n\nSo I think I mean and that's quite an achievement so you know those\n\n<$A> \n\nYah don't discourage yourself\n\n<$B> \n\nTrue\n\n<$A> \n\nBut but I still think uhm whether one has uhm an S or not in\nthat rizac uh test\n\n\nIt's still very important and crucial to a know uhm the\npsychological makeup\n\n\nEach pupil uhm because uhm in fact even I check with my friends of\nmine doing <unclear> word </unclear> problems uh they actually don't do much\nof uhm really psycho analysising each pupil you see\n\n\nI mean not really analysing a pupil's problems uhm all that things\nyou see or I mean even in P C C G also we don't have ready we don't really\nhave a counselling kind of setup you know\n\n\nBut we have already learnt counselling and things like that\n\n\nIt's just like we maybe because yah\n\n<$B> \n\nLecturers uh gives information pupil respond teacher gives\nfeedback\n\n<$A> \n\nYah it's like we just sat there and watched the video right\n\n\nWere you watching the video and then we went back and just analyse\nthe you know the conversation\n\n<$B> \n\nYah I think it was time constraining\n\n<$A> \n\nYah but I find that maybe they should actually enlarge this\narea because it's I mean\n\n<$B> \n\nGive us a real mock up\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nOf counselling session or an actual class dealing with pastor\npastoral care\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause otherwise then we'll be just like uh uhm I mean we we\nare just dealing with symptoms and not the problems you know\n\n\nThey they will always these pupils will always come back and the\nsame problems and the same problems again right make them really frustrated\nyou see\n\n<$B> \n\nYah but I think pastoral care is something uhm you can't\nreally learn as much as you can learn uhm classroom management because it has\nto do a lot with your own values and how you approach problems yourself\nbecause it's basically sharing yourself you know being a second parent to a\nchild\n\n\nThat was what I told the teacher but I guess she didn't find that\nuhm fitting comfortably in her lesson plan so she kind of dismissed it\n\n\nBut I still after all these weeks I still think it it's basically\nteaching you how to be second parent\n\n<$A> \n\nYah true\n\n\nIt's yah it's really like\n\n<$B> \n\nAll inclusive everything you've got you just try your best to\nhelp the child to become a better person\n\n<$A> \n\nI I just wish they can incorporate more of this uhm things\nmaybe next year lah probably they will\n\n<$B> \n\nMore of you mean to expand\n\n<$A> \n\nMore counselling yes\n\n<$B> \n\nthe P C C G programme\n\n<$A> \n\nYes more uh hand-on session practical sessions and more of uh\nlike uhm more new theories <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nI mean those teacher theories that we learnt you know uh like uhm\nthe ones uhm uhm Ericson uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nYah right\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm it's like kind of oldish already\n\n\nI mean it's like all those Skinner's behavioural I mean\nmodification\n\n\nIt's kind of it's already so back dated\n\n\nThat's what I find\n\n\nI mean we should actually read up more or Fraud's theory\n\n\nIt's very very bad dated\n\n<$B> \n\nI find them too general\n\n\nUhm they may be applicable still today but I find them too general\nand uh like a lot of academic theories tend to be\n\n\nSo you wouldn't find any individual case fitting very nicely into\non one model\n\n\nBut uhm there are always variations and thing I mean we are\nman-made anyway some man will continue making some more theories\n\n\nUh yah but so far I can't say I haven't learnt anything but uh\nit's just at the tip of the iceberg or maybe just the tip of the tip of the\niceberg\n\n<$A> \n\nActually I learn I did learn a lot but it's just that uhm I\nthought it could be better if they could incorporate uhm I mean give us more\ntime to pursue our own interest you know our own interested areas\n\n\nUhm you know but but the curriculum is such that we we don't\nreally have much time for our own interest you see\n\n\nI mean they're nice to give us uhm three-way plan \n\n<$B> \n\nI think I think it's they're strike a compromise already\nwith half the term half the course devoted to uh common subjects and the\nother half to specific areas so uhm perhaps what you like would be one-third\ncommon subjects and the other two-thirds specialisation", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

four years anything may happen you see what happen if I meet a man\nand I get married and this and that then I don't want to study anymore\n\n\nI mean you know\n\n<$A> \n\nTentative plans lah as least <unclear> word </unclear> some\npreparation\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know yet\n\n\nYou\n\n<$A> \n\nMe ah\n\n\nIf the door is open I will like to go into either youth work or\nprison ministry in the long-run\n\n<$B> \n\nSerious\n\n<$A> \n\nSo teaching is something like a stepping stone\n\n<$B> \n\nOh preparation lah\n\n<$A> \n\nIn a way because it affords me a lot of opportunities to talk\nto youngsters see how they behave\n\n\nYah so unless there is a ministry in teaching itself that keeps me\nthere then I will stay yah but I do hope that the Lord will call me either\nprisons or delinquents ministry\n\n<$B> \n\nSo actually now I mean uh by attending this course is just\nlike uh I mean you want to get formal training is it\n\n\nYou want to get some kind of formal training I guess\n\n<$A> \n\nNot really formal training but it's more like on the job\ntraining\n\n\nAnyway teaching is something that I like and I have lots and lots\nof opportunities to mix around with young people and in itself it is a\nministry you see because you can change lives\n\n\nYou can influence the kids\n\n<$B> \n\nYah that is right\n\n<$A> \n\nIf the Lord calls me somewhere else then this will be a very\ngood preparation\n\n\nI hope to be able to do that\n\n<$B> \n\nYah I think that <unclear> word </unclear> sounds interesting\nbut it is very it is not easy\n\n\nIt will be very tough\n\n<$A> \n\nIt is very tough\n\n<$B> \n\nCan be quite tough you know\n\n<$A> \n\nThat is why must pray a lot\n\n<$B> \n\nYah I mean spiritually you must build up also\n\n\nYou must build up your spiritual life also\n\n<$A> \n\nHopefully my future spouse is someone who has the same vision\n\n<$B> \n\nYah\n\n<$A> \n\nOtherwise it can never come true\n\n<$B> \n\nLast just last June I attended this my church camp\n\n\nThen we had this speaker called uhm this African speaker missionary\nDaniel Ungamore or whatever his name is\n\n\nYah then uhm we are attending the camp then he prophesied you see\n\n\nThen he called me out you know\n\n\nI was so sacred because he's a very aggressive speaker\n\n\nCalled me out then he then he said uh what uhm about this mine I'm\ngoing to uhm China\n\n\nNo he didn't say\n\n<$A> \n\nHe prophesied that you are going to China\n\n<$B> \n\nYes he didn't say I'm going to China he just said that uhm you\nwill be going to your grandfather's land and my grandfather happened to come\nfrom China\n\n\nYes you see and he said uhm and then you you'd be going to uhm Hong\nKong first from there you will be going to Canton or whatever is\n\n\nI can't remember what is it and then uhm and you will minister to\nthe young students there and if you are faithful okay then you will uh\nminister to the ladies the young ladies\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nYah especially my ministry\n\n<$A> \n\nThat is very specific prophecy\n\n<$B> \n\nYah very specific\n\n\nThen I was I was quite shocked because he he doesn't know me you\nsee and\n\n<$A> \n\nHow did he call you out\n\n<$B> \n\nHe just points he just point at me and then I just stand up\nand I I was very nervous\n\n\nThen then he said I got a I I I'm big but I got a small heart\n\n\nThen got fears <unclear> word </unclear> because I never never\nnever consider missionary work before never\n\n\nSo it was like a big step for me\n\n\nAnd then it happens that one of my good friend my very good friend\nhe is now in China doing mission work work work for six months\n\n\nIt is like then a lot of my friends said it's like John the Baptist\nyou know not exactly but preparing the way for me making contact esta\nestablishing contacts for me\n\n<$A> \n\nBut I think work missionary work in China is not easy\n\n<$B> \n\nI know and I am a very fussy person especially the cleanliness\nI don't know how I'm going to survive\n\n<$A> \n\nWell the Lord will prepare when he calls\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's right\n\n<$A> \n\nActually prison ministry for me won't be easy also because I'm\nI'm not firm enough you see\n\n\nSometime I get too soft with the people then get pushed around\n\n\nThat is not really advisable\n\n\nMaybe that is why I have to learn how to teach first\n\n<$B> \n\nYou are very acceptive\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm to be teaching\n\n\nBut is teaching your first choice\n\n<$B> \n\nActually uh uhm I was considering journalism journal\n\n<$A> \n\nThat is nice\n\n\nBut what make you change your mind\n\n<$B> \n\nI mean that that was after J C then uhm amazingly lah the Lord\njust showed showed me which direction he wanted me to go\n\n\nYah then I just come into teaching\n\n\nActually I never considered teaching before for my whole\n\n\nAll the while was to be a journalist you know or a reporter you\nknow that kind of thing because I like to write you see\n\n<$A> \n\nYah that is interesting\n\n<$B> \n\nThen after that yah lor teaching\n\n<$A> \n\nI actually hated teaching you know initially\n\n\nLike when my sister went into teaching because my father wanted one\nof us to be a teacher\n\n\nSo when my sister became a teacher I was telling myself whew I\ndon't have to be one yah so I went into Law\n\n\nI wanted to do Law because it is kind of closely connected to\nprisons you see\n\n\nBut I realise it's not\n\n\nYou never really get to establish close contacts with the prisoners\n\n\nIt is very much like a client and some stern relationship\n\n\nSo later on I went uhm I did a bit of relief teaching\n\n\nThen I liked it very much and I realise that my inclination is\nactually towards youth\n\n\nYah so I started praying about it and miraculously God has been\nopening doors you see\n\n\nYah like initially I was offered P G D E primary programme and I\nknew that I didn't want it\n\n\nSo I rejected them and I know that if I reject them there will be a\nkind of record\n\n<$B> \n\nYah\n\n<$A> \n\nSo they may not accept me again on the second application\n\n\nSo when the second application came out I applied again and then\nnotwithstanding the fact that they told us that those who have been rejected\nor have been offered a place don't have to apply again they will not consider\nus you see\n\n\nSo I was kind of troubled\n\n\nI prayed about it and I wrote the letter\n\n\nI I wrote the application and I wrote a cover letter for the\napplication\n\n\nAnd it's really miraculous how I was given this this opportunity\nto come in here\n\n\nAnd I was wagged upside down during the interview you know\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat did they\n\n<$A> \n\nFor rejecting them\n\n<$B> \n\nOh you mean they ask you oh\n\n<$A> \n\nThey ask me why I rejected them in the first place and what\nmade me so sure that I am good enough to teach in the secondary school and\nall that and then they slime me saying that I have no teaching subjects\nwhatsoever\n\n<$B> \n\nNo English what\n\n<$A> \n\nBut I am not uhm technically trained in English\n\n<$B> \n\nYah lah neither am I okay\n\n<$A> \n\nYah but at least you have Lang\n\n<$B> \n\nI mean Lit\n\n<$A> \n\nLit Lit yah I have nothing\n\n\nSo in a way it's really a miracle and I am thankful to God lah\nbecause I faced a lot of objection from my parents\n\n\nIt is like a big switch in my career\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause you are doing Law you know\n\n\nI mean you did Law and some professional degree\n\n<$A> \n\nSo to them it's a kind of a sacrifice\n\n\nBut I'm glad that I'm much happier now and they are accepting the\nfact\n\n\nI'm a happier person in the teaching profession\n\n\nSo thank God for that\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat was your sister's reaction\n\n<$A> \n\nShe was very upset\n\n\nShe didn't want me to come into teaching\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause in a way she she knows that it's not easy\n\n\nIt's tough\n\n\nAnd for young teachers you may not see all the happenings within\nthe profession\n\n\nIt's just it's more than just teaching\n\n\nBut then again she respected my views and I think I'll stick to it\nuntil I'm called elsewhere\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat did you do within that year waiting for for the next\napplication\n\n<$A> \n\nI was doing a lot of temp jobs while waiting\n\n\nSo in in a way I kind of wasted a year\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat kind of jobs\n\n<$A> \n\nClerks\n\n<$B> \n\nSerious ah\n\n<$A> \n\nYes accounts clerk data entry operator\n\n<$B> \n\nAll those clerical jobs ah\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd I spent half a year in Great Joy accounting person\n<unclear> word </unclear> so close to them\n\n\nBut it's it's a good training lah\n\n\nAt at least I learn how to be humble and appreciate the so-called\nlower jobs\n\n<$B> \n\nYes that's right because with your degree uh really\n\n<$A> \n\nA lot jobs a lot of places rejected me\n\n<$B> \n\nHow come\n\n<$A> \n\nSaying that I'm over-qualified\n\n\nRemember the passage that you read or not\n\n<$B> \n\nI think I know I know I think because you under applied\n\n<$A> \n\nIn a way in a way\n\n\nThey dare not employ me because I'm a degree holder you see and I\nonly want jobs like clerical jobs and all that\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nThey they think I'm strange nut\n\n<$B> \n\nBut it's uhm good experience for you\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's a lot of it takes a lot of training and faith you know\nlike allowing God to take control of every step of the way because you really\ndo not know what's happening right\n\n\nIt's so much uncertainty because I was when I was doing the odd\njobs odd jobs I actually didn't know whether I they will take me in and I\njust went ahead and spent one year waiting\n\n\nAnd the Lord is good very faithful\n\n\nI'm very thankful for it\n\n<$B> \n\nYah I'm quite thankful of God also\n\n\nI don't know and the interview was a breeze\n\n<$A> \n\nOh really\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause I I'm I was the last person you see\n\n\nThen all those before me I knew them all from my Lit group\n\n\nThen they were they were they went in before me and they came out\nwith very horrid expressions\n\n\nThey bombarded them with lots of tough questions\n\n<$A> \n\nYah I heard\n\n<$B> \n\nSo when I went in I was very nervous but I and when I'm ner\nwhen I'm nervous I tend to smile a lot you see\n\n\nSo I went in and then the first thing they asked me was things\nlike uhm do you have any relief teaching experience things like that then I\nsaid yes just for a week\n\n\nThen they ask me whether uhm no what else did they ask what is my\nfavourite author\n\n\nSo I told them Jane Austin\n\n\nThen they said oh is it everyone likes Jane Austin\n\n\nThen I tell tell them then asked me about the course that I I took\nfor Lit right in in N U S and the kind of books I like read and things like\nthat\n\n\nVery easy\n\n\nIt's all due to my own uhm it's like my own asking me about my own\nhobbies and things like that", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

purpose because I know you expect that\n\n<$C> \n\nDon't worry\n\n<$D> \n\nI'm used to this\n\n\nI'm used to this\n\n<$C> \n\nOK\n\n\nGo away\n\n\nSign this\n\n\nSign this\n\n\nSay that you don't mind signing this thing\n\n\nIf you don't want your name come out OK\n\n\nThen you don't tick it\n\n<$D> \n\nYou know what\n\n\nI think <unclear> word <unclear>\n\n<$C> \n\n\n\n\nCensor\n\n<$D> \n\nNo I think he's a great guy\n\n\nSeriously seriously I think he's a great guy but his style of\nleadership is not suitable for the present generation\n\n\nSeriously I mean I respect the fellow\n\n\nSome

\n\nRelativity and uh quantum mechanics\n\n<$C> \n\n\n\n<$D> \n\nWhy are you laughing\n\n<$C> \n\nYou are doing that for fun\n\n\nIt's a hobby\n\n<$D> \n\nI teaching myself\n\n<$C> \n\nHow can you teach yourself a subject as abstract as that\n\n<$D> \n\n\n\n\nI'm a physics\n\n<$C> \n\nHongkey\n\n\nHongkey face\n\n\nDon't give answers\n\n<$D> \n\nNo I am a physics student\n\n\nI am doing physics\n\n\nCan you read up now\n\n\nOK you are majoring in phylo\n\n\nNo it's not phylo\n\n\nSorry it's phylan right\n\n\nCan you pick up a phylan book of a certain level and be able to\nunderstand all these big theos and whatever\n\n<$C> \n\nBecause I've done that\n\n<$D> \n\nExactly\n\n<$C> \n\nBut it's easy if something you studied before\n\n<$D> \n\nSo isn't that what university education about\n\n\nTraining your mind\n\n\nHaving the ability now to pick up any book that you want to read\nand teach yourself\n\n<$C> \n\nWah\n\n<$D> \n\nNo exactly\n\n\nNow physics is possible\n\n\nRight\n\n\nI mean can read anything anything new and absorb new ideas right\n\n\nThe thing is it might possible and simple\n\n\nNot it's not simple it's hard\n\n\nBut the thing is it's possible\n\n<$C> \n\nJust now when you paged me did you write down your number\nyourself\n\n<$D> \n\nNo I did not\n\n<$C> \n\nIt came as 354 0026\n\n\nSo I keep calling this family\n\n\nWhen this little kid picked up the phone and say Mummy and Daddy\nare at work\n\n\nWho paged me\n\n<$D> \n\nNo I never put down my one\n\n\nI just put the double\n\n<$C> \n\nNow it just came out like that\n\n\nThat's why I was wondering who was it\n\n\nPaged me\n\n<$D> \n\nAm I supposed to speakers come out with someone ah\n\n\nAgree to the recording\n\n\nWas Singapore is a project of the <unclear> word <unclear>\n\n<$C> \n\nWah mashiaolah\n\n\nIt sounds like that meh\n\n<$D> \n\nYeah <unclear> word <unclear>\n\n<$C> \n\nAh OK\n\n<$D> \n\nSay second is my mum told me when I was a kid\n\n\nAnd it just start off\n\n<$C> \n\nOK\n\n<$D> \n\nAnd it was good what I'm supposed to take\n\n<$C> \n\nNo no no\n\n\nNo it's just\n\n<$D> \n\nIf you want to be ornamous I don't care\n\n\nI want to be famous\n\n<$C> \n\n\n\n<$D> \n\nSo you guys know\n\n\n<unclear> word <unclear> What do you research this for anyway\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd it's to study how like regional speakers or something\n\n\nSo like how Malay speak English\n\n\nDo you have lah loh after all you know\n\n<$D> \n\nYes\n\n<$C> \n\nCode-switching\n\n<$D> \n\nDo you want me to speak like that now\n\n<$C> \n\nNo\n\n<$D> \n\nOr speak how are you\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah speak how are you\n\n\nSpeak normally\n\n<$D> \n\nOK\n\n\nNo I've done this several times but not for this specific reason\nbut for other reasons\n\n<$C> \n\nHow if I don't get this\n\n\nAyah\n\n<$D> \n\nNot that serious\n\n\nCome on\n\n\nI mean there are options available\n\n\nI know how to feel but it could be the same way\n\n\nIt's like right now I just don't have the energy almost to do\nanything\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah I'm just waiting for me to work for for for like three\nmonths on project basis\n\n<$D> \n\nWell I don't want this type of working meh\n\n\nFuck you\n\n\nI don't like this type of working\n\n<$C> \n\nDee dee\n\n\nCensor\n\n<$D> \n\nLook\n\n\nYou   told me to speak normally \n\n<$C> \n\n OK\n\n\nI know  \n\n\nI know\n\n\nI know\n\n<$D> \n\nI'm speaking normally here\n\n\nHa I mean like I mean\n\n\nOK my broo works\n\n\nBut he is married I know\n\n\nAnd he doesn't earn enough to even feed himself and his wife\n\n\nAnd he just bought a car and all that\n\n\nSo my mum is sort of supporting the family\n\n<$C> \n\nWhy\n\n\nWhy he\n\n\nWhy doesn't he change work then\n\n<$D> \n\nNo no\n\n\nI mean he has lots of prospects\n\n\nHe has good relationship with his immediate superiors\n\n\nHe just got a diploma which were good recognised and his good\nworking attitude\n\n\nThey like him \n\n\nSo I would give him two three more... The only thing is he only\nhas the confidence no more In Singapore we all know your how much your paper\nqualification counts So if he stays there I would say within the next five\nyears he would\n\n<$C> \n\nFive years he will wait you know\n\n<$D> \n\nFive years he would go up He would be have quite huge high\nlevel I would have to start talk to him about that you know Cos he doesn't\nreally know about promotions job prospects and all that increments He's a bit\nblur lah So I mean that's a good task for me to start working as soon as\npossible Yet at the same time I don't want to work\n\n<$C> \n\nExactly But I have to work\n\n<$D> \n\nNo I felt this way twice before After <Besent> college\nCanada and national service this emptiness spoiled...\n\n<$C> \n\n<unclear> word <unclear>\n\n<$D> \n\nYeah but... Yeah I'm doing the same thing like you I'm\nhelping out the CSLL <unclear> word <unclear> I'm most probably be conducting\nextra lessons for the kids at AMP and all that uh I'm really teaching myself\nquantum mechanics and relativity and all that Yet it doesn't do you feel joy\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah definitely\n\n<$D> \n\nYou just feel like... I'm just going into that emotion I'm\nfeeling from day to day waiting for my fucking results to come out and\nthen...\n\n<$C> \n\nWhen is yours coming out Mine is the 4th of June\n\n<$D> \n\nThe day before yours On the day on the 4th I'll be coming to\ncheck if I get honours or not Most probably I will not get it\n\n<$C> \n\n<unclear> word <unclear>\n\n<$D> \n\nWhat\n\n<$C> \n\nHonours\n\n<$D> \n\nYeah The letter with... They will posted on the notice board\n\n<$C> \n\nThis is another thing I don't even know if I can get it Even\nif I get it I don't even know that I'll work at it\n\n<$D> \n\nYeah that's another thing for me also I'm just tired of\nexams I'm fucking tired The one paper statistics mechanics <unclear> word\n<unclear> which I can't I couldn't afford to <screw> up and it was an easy\npaper and that made it worse because the module was \" Yeah it's OK ah\" So for\nme I couldn't do it because I just got so tired you know I just... And to\nmake matters worse four days later I was sitting in the Physics Department\narea and that same professor came down and saw me He came up saying \" Ai come\non <unclear> word <unclear> I really enjoy your paper\" This is the not an\nexam research paper we are asked to do \" I really enjoy your paper It's\noriginal It's the first paper that I read and...\" she didn't say explicitly\nbut you one was thinking no other paper came close to it in terms of you know\noriginality and thought Cos that module was basically just reading from\nsomewhere processing and just reduplicating in their own words <unclear> word\n<unclear> But I felt so bad we don't have time to talk but only say \" Ei I'm\nsorry I <screwed> up your exam\" But in fact she is a good teacher I feel let\nlet him down\n\n<$C> \n\nCan have dinner lah actually <unclear> word <unclear>\n\n<$D> \n\nYeah that's what I'm thinking But can do you have enough\nmoney to pay for me\n\n<$C> \n\nLike fifteen dollars OK\n\n<$D> \n\nI can send you both if you have any extra <unclear> word\n<unclear>\n\n<$C> \n\nNo I got twelve dollars\n\n<$D> \n\n<unclear> word <unclear>\n\n<$C> \n\nI got twelve dollars\n\n<$D> \n\nWell\n\n<$C> \n\nYou can eat something with twelve dollars\n\n<$D> \n\nNow I was thinking of some hawker centres <unclear> word\n<unclear>\n\n<$C> \n\nI take bus from here\n\n<$D> \n\nWhat time  is St Margaret\n\n<$C> \n\n708 or 703\n\n<$D> \n\nYou wait lah seven fifteen something Make sure... There was\none <unclear> word <unclear>\n\n<$C> \n\nOK now One more time\n\n<$D> \n\nOne more time Again God is testing... From that day onwards\nI learned through my lesson too well <unclear> word <unclear>\n\n<$C> \n\nThat's not good you know Not at all\n\n<$D> \n\nNo sometimes I got so angry with my books or doing something\nCan lah five more minutes five more minutes five more minutes five more\nminutes It's like one hour <unclear> word <unclear>\n\n<$C> \n\nOh I must secure myself <unclear> word <unclear> especially\nnow I think it's the <sprinture> lack\n\n<$D> \n\nYeah Do you feel that\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah\n\n<$D> \n\nI feel...\n\n<$C> \n\nBecause nothing that books could actually fill up\n\n<$D> \n\nYeah I agree\n\n<$C> \n\nIt is why ah I so desperately to go overseas I have to leave\nthis...

their store does\nnot open on Sunday you know\n\n\nBecause they were the reporter was quite curious because Sunday is\nthe day where most of the stores make their money you see\n\n\nSaturdays and

Sabbath\n\n<$A> \n\nYa lah ya lah that is why lah\n\n\nBecause I probably they were thinking like aiyah we have so many\nmillions already you know what is another couple of millions\n\n\nI know they some of the Tang clan or what family or what they\nattend this church at uh Queenstown\n\n<$B> \n\nIs it\n\n<$A> \n\nYah it is called Church of our Saviour and I know that one of\nthe weekly bible

closing you know right\n\n<$B> \n\nThey they I think they stocked quite intelligently because\nthey does they they don't just like\n\n\nAnyway anyway all shopping centres look alike\n\n<$A> \n\nYah lah\n\n<$B> \n\nbut they all there are very strange and interesting items you\nsee\n\n<$A> \n\nLike like Studio Tangs lah\n\n<$B> \n\nYah yah\n\n<$A> \n\nThis niche marketing lah\n\n<$B> \n\nYah for

reasons\n\n<$E> \n\nUhm\n\n<$D> \n\nBut that doesn't make sense\n\n\nHinduism never   stipulated that you cannot  eat beef\n\n<$E> \n\n Shut up <unclear> word </unclear>  \n\n<$D> \n\nHinduism never stipulated that you cannot eat beef\n\n<$E> \n\nit did\n\n<$D> \n\nWhere\n\n<$E> \n\nI don't know lah\n\n\nJust shut up lah\n\n<$D> \n\nYou see it's a cultural concept\n\n\nWait\n\n\nIt's not fair\n\n\nYou see ah beef was probably not to be eaten in the Indian culture\nbecause cow gives milk\n\n\nAnd milk is also given by the mother\n\n\nAnd therefore cows were compared as sacred to mothers\n\n\nAnd that's why they say you shouldn't eat cows\n\n\nIt's got no religious connotations\n\n<$E> \n\nYah it is associated with Siva what\n\n<$D> \n\nNo\n\n\nSiva himself is just a construct because humans were not able to\nfocus on a particular point\n\n<$E> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$D> \n\nThey cannot pray to the formless So humans created for\nthemselves forms\n\n\nAlright Therefore just\n\n\nSiva is just a fictitious thing from the mind\n\n<$E> \n\nOh I see\n\n<$D> \n\nAnd there is only one God ain't that right'\n\n<$E> \n\nYah\n\n<$D> \n\nYah and so there is no Shiva\n\n<$E> \n\nso you should be able to eat beef\n\n\nWell I've been brought up that way\n\n<$D> \n\nNo but since it defies logic so you should   start\neating beef now \n\n<$E> \n\n Uh no I don't want  \n\n\nDon't like\n\n<$D> \n\nBecause you don't like   Now that's a  different\nreason altogether\n\n<$E> \n\n No no no  \n\n\nI've been brought up that way\n\n<$D> \n\nYah so now you're not eating beef because you don't  \nlike it \n\n<$E> \n\n Maybe  \n\n<$D> \n\nMaybe\n\n<$E> \n\nMaybe yah\n\n<$D> \n\nSo it is not a religious reason   anymore \n\n<$E> \n\n Maybe it is still  \n\n<$D> \n\nWhy\n\n<$E> \n\nit is lah\n\n<$D> \n\nWhy\n\n\nWhere is the logic\n\n<$E> \n\nNo there is a logic\n\n<$D> \n\nAre you saying Hinduism   is not logical \n\n<$E> \n\n <unclear> word </unclear>  \n\n\nNo it is\n\n<$D> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> it is\n\n<$E> \n\nIt is\n\n\nI'll think of an answer and tell it to you by tonight\n\n\nI just cannot get my words straight \n\n<$D> \n\n You are

{"text": "<$A> \n\nSo the first part will be a brief lit review\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat should come first the bit about Singapore or the bit about\nthis uhm the lit review\n\n<$A> \n\nOr should we then use this\n\n\nWe start with here skip that we start with here since this part has\nbeen thrown out anyway\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n\nUhm so it's not so much of lit review but a review on Singapore as a\nsociety in composition and\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then a brief mention of the different strategies available\nin developing and developed ya\n\n<$B> \n\nA brief a brief a very brief mention\n\n<$A> \n\nThen\n\n<$B> \n\nSo the next bit we state in state impacts right on uh state\npolicies and impacts on household structure first\n\n<$A> \n\nState impact\n\n<$B> \n\nOh we forgot the bit about women\n\n\nThat's here is it\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nReviewing Sing Singapore women rather\n\n<$A> \n\nThis one will include change in\n\n<$B> \n\nreligious <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nwomen's\n\n<$B> \n\nwomen's structures or something uh\n\n<$A> \n\nWomen's priority ah and change in household structure\n\n\nThat impact is on this point\n\n<$B> \n\nSo in this case just to review two strengths and policy uh\nstate policies and the impacts on household structure and state policies on\nchild care\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd some here somewhere here we mention that or here that they\nare uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nLogical uh they've no ethnic bias\n\n<$A> \n\nMake it more implicit that they they they don't regard one\ngroup above another of this special persons you see\n\n<$B> \n\nThe multi-racial identity\n\n<$A> \n\nMulti-racial\n\n\nAnd then we talk about the H D B and other housing policy and down\nhere M C B\n\n<$B> \n\nHere put all the M C B stuff here then more explicit exactly\nwhat they do\n\n\nRight so what we're saying is that uhm because Singapore is\nchanging uhm traditional forms of child care are now disappearing right and\nuh new ones are emerging\n\n\nThe the state uh is trying to do a couple things\n\n\nOne is to try to provide alternate means of childcare in terms of\nthe childcare centres and secondly to try to encourage in some form of that\ntraditional support structure so it'll carry on that's about all\n\n\nUhm okay\n\n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat what I do\n\n<$B> \n\nFairly nicely right <unclear> word </unclear> to\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> on\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay first of all we could have all all this stuff about how\nuhm childcare centres are very popular so that's part one right with with\nwomen in Singapore\n\n<$A> \n\nSo this will have partial <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nI think we can use like uhm some of the board general idea\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nSo there will be specific data that which I know data that\nacross all household types and in in fact across all ethnic groups except or\nperhaps the Malays uhm has been a very acceptable form of child care\n\n<$A> \n\nChildcare centres <unclear> word </unclear> after all\nhousehold structures then <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nexcept uh perhaps the Malays\n\n<$A> \n\nMalay\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay and then uhm secondly uhm so that's the response\n<unclear> word </unclear> then response to housing to\n\n<$A> \n\nEnergy <unclear> word </unclear> arrangement and <unclear>\nword </unclear> and <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nSo are we saying that the women like responding fairly well to\nthis as well to this this strategy this state policy\n\n<$A> \n\nPerhaps you may not say that the women are responding well but\nthat uhm this kind of strategy is correct and if the women are shown that\nwith more than just state rhetoric you know they okay this is working use it\n\n\nThis is in fact the case that these women are finding it less of a\nproblem because they have really readily available help at home\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nSo it is useful\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm but uh I think we could then end by saying that uhm that\nuhm these have not proven entirely sufficient because women are still finding\nor some women are finding it a need to turn to foreign maids\n\n\nUhm what's the other one which is up here\n\n\nForeign maids right and that uh even with all these options there\nare still gaps which is which will be the gaps will be all those who quit\nright\n\n\nAnd a few household housewives\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> as far as <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nNo it's that it's I think it is gelling on all the ideas\n\n<$A> \n\nthat we have been working with and not\n\n<$B> \n\nThe next stage will be the uh economic restructuring phase uh\nwomen quitting and also the cultural constraints <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nI think that's enough nah\n\n<$B> \n\nYa and I don't know right I mean if the introduction takes up\nif you're talking about like six pages the rest will take up about\n\n\nThis will take up say three quarters of the page one or two pages\nof the page\n\n<$A> \n\nAye I think it's more than one\n\n<$B> \n\nYa because it has all the data\n\n<$A> \n\nYa one and a half maybe\n\n\nThis one will be about two and a half two and a half\n\n<$B> \n\nNo I can't allow that then we have no more space\n\n\nIf this is one this is two then this is to be\n\n<$A> \n\nThis is about two and a half\n\n\nTwo pages\n\n\nShould be okay right\n\n\nIf this is one and a half then two three four five and six\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nShould be\n\n\nI mean this is this is the maximum\n\n\nIf you know it's going\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's five

to summarise the main ideas uh to give\nemphasis to state poli policies in Singapore\n\n\nMention the what's this for\n\n\nAsian cities <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nYou seem to be getting a bit more mileage out of that conference\nthat caused you so much agony\n\n<$A> \n\nAgony\n\n\nI think I'm sick because of it\n\n\nMust have settle with my bone\n\n\nLast night I could not even swallow\n\n\nIt

ah\n\n<$B> \n\nSure but they want don't want already so that's more or less\nthere It will be centre\n\n\nThis one you know that uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nI think it's safer to do the other one first because then at\nleast I know what's ready <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's right\n\n\nI think we give priority to that one I'll\n\n<$A> \n\nThat day you know you're trying to tell me to do both by\nDecember\n\n\nI mean I know it's necessary but it's\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I have to get round to doing the women's studies one too\nand that's like one out of <unclear> word </unclear> twenty\n\n<$A> \n\nStill haven't revise my <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nOh that should be quite fast what\n\n\nWhy don't you do when Fauziah's around\n\n<$A> \n\nShe was she I I gave it to her and <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's basically that one section that has been rewritten right\n\n\nI don't remember\n\n<$A> \n\nShe she just looked at it and wrote some stuff on the piece\nof paper we talked about it and I was like okay okay never mind\n\n\nWe could say something bad about Sharmala\n\n<$B> \n\nThat is true\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd Karmalini ai aiyah what I always say to Karmalini I\nalways hear them before I see them\n\n\nThe three studious\n\n<$B> \n\nThree\n\n\nOh ya uh what's the other girl's name you know the one who's\nwalked in\n\n<$A> \n\nSuzanna\n\n\nLet's say it loud\n\n<$B> \n\nStop this right\n\n<$A> \n\nNo she wants us to continue talking for a while more\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nOr you want it back\n\n\nOr you want to continue talking for a while more\n\n<$B> \n\nUh maybe another what\n\n<$A> \n\nDo you need it\n\n\nIf you don't need it it's five minutes\n\n\nOkay fine\n\n\nYou just stay outside\n\n<$B> \n\nFive minutes ya okay\n\n\nOkay so and then uh this so this thing would be about how\nmulti-generational households different members use how they use space in\ndifferent types of flats right\n\n\nAnd uh some themes would be like the how they negotiate public and\nprivate space and uh how uhm how they were maximised\n\n\nWhat what's the term I want where you use the space for multiple\npurposes\n\n\nLike something could be used as as a sleeping quarters at one\npoint of time and then change\n\n\nNo because all like for example smaller flats a bit of constraints\nso uh negotiating constraints of space okay like uh multiple functions that\nkind of thing right\n\n<$A> \n\nOr where you have to have two dinner times or that kind of\nthing right\n\n<$B> \n\nYa I think we just talk about it as temporal\n\n<$A> \n\nStaggering of\n\n<$B> \n\nLike bathing\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I think it's one F Brenda\n\n<$B> \n\nSorry\n\n<$A> \n\nStaggering off shoo don't bathe today don't eat today\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd we could think of other things\n\n<$A> \n\nYa and perhaps also like uhm if we do manage to find part of\nit in the case study ask them what they would like you know and whether they\ncould <unclear> word </unclear> extensions extra balcony space and all that\nso\n\n<$B> \n\nThis creeps in to the upgrading\n\n<$A> \n\nWe will step on certain people's toes sometimes\n\n\nWhat what physical aspects they will like changed What their\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay this will particularly be pertinent in the M G flat\nwhich is specially designed\n\n\nAnd then for those for the other two types we could talk about for\nthe last type the three room we could talk about upgrading\n\n<$A> \n\nUpgrading\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd what they would like to see the extra balcony and all\nthat Because uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nYa <unclear> word </unclear> time\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's it is not mine neighbour but it will be coming soon so\nuhm you know we might be able to\n\n<$A> \n\nIt'd be nice to have on the <unclear> word </unclear> have\nalready had it\n\n<$B> \n\nBut the upgrading process hasn't proceeded far enough\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause the one in-charge of Jalan Nela was only a few and we\ncould go and ask\n\n\nWe could get Louviana to give us the

died\n\n\nThen the thing roll down on the floor and roll down on the things\n\n<$A> \n\n  One of  their bottles\n\n<$B> \n\n It's too   beautiful and ya when he died you see\nthe screen the windows

DeNiro did a lot of bad things but he said that there's few\ngood things he did\n\n<$B> \n\nOne good thing he did\n\n\nYa   which is  very very nice\n\n<$A> \n\n Which was   to help Finn realize uh his talent\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nI was so confused\n\n\nI was like wondering where where he got the notion that he likes\nto draw\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n\nOh ya ah\n\n<$B> \n\nThen I remembered it was the it was the\n\n<$A> \n\nOh yes\n\n<$B> \n\nbook\n\n\nIt fell out of his hand into the water and he kept it\n\n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nThe first part is so important when when Finn was at the\nseaside and he just drew the fishes he saw the birds that he saw\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nSo touching hor\n\n\nRobert DeNiro actually kept the book\n\n\nYa\n\n\nI thought it fell into the sea\n\n<$B> \n\nYa he was

in the modern time lah\n\n\nThe books tells more ya uses the that so called different kind of\nEnglish\n\n<$B> \n\nYa and that ah you see in the book does it talk about the\nupper class and the lower class   of society  hor\n\n<$A> \n\n Oh yes  \n\n\nOh yes\n\n<$B> \n\nSo pretentious ah the higher class\n\n\nThe buildings look so monotonous right\n\n\nYou get the feeling\n\n\nThe art gallery the buildings that you walk through the subway\neverything look so monotonous\n\n\nIt's only when it's in the open\n\n<$A> \n\nOh yeah like the\n\n<$B> \n\nThe it looks like the the water run down the leaves rush\neverywhere stuff like that uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd how it comes\n\n\nIt went one full circle when when Finn comes back to his  \nhouse again  to visit his uncle Joe\n\n<$B> \n\n Ya correct

it\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nJust ya\n\n\nIt's very sad\n\n<$A> \n\nSo although he realized Finn realises his dream of bring an\nartist and and being so-called rich to match uhm Estella's status you know\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nEstella whom he loved very much\n\n<$B> \n\nRight\n\n<$A> \n\nHere he felt very empty\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nYa he felt very empty and he he he lost himself I thought\n\n<$B> \n\nYa ya\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n\nHe lost himself but his sole aim is to find Estella his love \n you know \n\n<$B> \n\n Ya ya  \n\n\nBut why did tell me in the book why why did Estella I

way you know\n\n\nUhm ya something like that lah\n\n<$B> \n\nYa I get it\n\n\nActually come to think about it actually uh this movie speaks very\nbadly about men leh\n\n<$A> \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nHah\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy why why so why   I mean \n\n<$B> \n\n Don't know leh  \n\n\nRemember the wo the lady says Men are the bad things in life\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause she had a bad experience you know\n\n\nShe was left at the altar but we don't know why\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nBut it's beautiful in that how I mean Finn got got a chance\nto realise himself right\n\n<$B> \n\nHe's quite innocent lah\n\n\nHor innocent\n\n<$A> \n\nDo you think it's a love story also\n\n<$B> \n\nIt is a love story lah\n\n\nTo me to me it's a love story lor\n\n\nUhm what is it to you\n\n<$A> \n\nYa in a way it is\n\n\nIt's about men\n\n<$B> \n\nMen again\n\n<$A> \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay let it out\n\n<$A> \n\nAn artist reborn \n\n<$B> \n\nAh\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay but it is also about the prisoner you know\n\n\nSo so called low-class you know did a lot of bad things\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd yet so although he's bad he can still do one good thing\nyou know\n\n\nYou know he help he helps Finn to you know become who he is you\nknow\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd yet the upper class supposedly to have everything but\nthen they   what good did  they do\n\n<$B> \n\n Ya  \n\n\nYa they're so pretentious\n\n\nEveryone dressed up in their black tie and like the   coat\nand everything \n\n<$A> \n\n Ya uhm  \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd they make their stupid jokes you remember\n\n\nThe part

and stuff like that \n\n<$A> \n\n Uhm ya  \n\n\nSo it says bad things about the upper class in a way\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nIt's pretty clear\n\n\nIt's pretty clear\n\n\nYa clear\n\n\nNice lah\n\n\nVery\n\n\nI find it very nice\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n\nQuite empty right\n\n\nThe lives they have   the upper class \n\n<$B> \n\n Very ya very  \n\n<$A> \n\nThey dress up so well but actually I don't know\n\n\nI kind of like that kind of life where you just go to seem just be\nwith nature\n\n\nLike what Finn and and and did at the beginning you know\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nIn the beginning the narration was beautiful lor\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nSome some of the things Finn says but can't really can't\nreally remember but it says like you know that when benefactor experience uhm\nwhen he says like uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nLike uh ya when you look from over her a little bit it's a\nbit   noisy there \n\n<$B> \n\n Ya right  \n\n<$A> \n\nBut I can't hear what he was saying\n\n<$B> \n\nOh ya ya\n\n\nHe was saying something like let me think ah\n\n\nLet me think\n\n\nUh oh after that benefactor experience when the small kid he says\nsomething like Sometimes in life uh no not in life sometimes you have a look\njust a little brush with real life\n\n<$A> \n\nUh ya\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd that's when you really experience\n\n\nYou know what life can really be that tremendous experience that\nhe has as a kid when Robert DeNiro like captured him and made him made him do\ncertain things and things like that\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nThat that\n\n<$A> \n\nI I I also like that part when uh Finn says I'd like to tell\nthe story\n\n\nNot as it happens\n\n<$B> \n\nAh\n\n<$A> \n\nBut   as I remember \n\n<$B> \n\nYa  as you remember   ya\n\n\nThat's beautiful\n\n<$A> \n\nThat's just like you right\n\n\nYou like to remember things\n\n<$B> \n\nI mean you you that's how we remember\n\n\nYa\n\n\nWhat we remember is always the assets\n\n<$A> \n\nYa the assets\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd the

word\n</unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nMeaning I bought I had four tickets and I only needed two\n\n<$C> \n\nOh dear\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$C> \n\nWell you can try Kumu\n\n\nShe's kind of idle right now\n\n<$A>

eh\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nUh huh\n\n\nHow much\n\n\nOh thirty\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$C> \n\nOh that's a thought\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's up in the circle\n\n\nUhm one of my friends told me it's okay seats\n\n<$C> \n\nUh huh\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm I'll be going with Andrew on the same night\n\n<$C> \n\nOh on the same night but different seats\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n\nUhm uhm just different seats\n\n<$C>

yes\n\n\nThe one with Transfigured Night but I think those are completely\nsold out\n\n<$C> \n\nUh huh ya\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nI thought it would be\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$C> \n\nWe tried\n\n\nThe only one my friends tried to get was the Dallas Symphony\n\n<$A> \n\nOh and\n\n<$C> \n\nTried to get\n\n<$A> \n\nOh okay\n\n\nTried to get\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd then for the rest of it I thought oh give it a skip \n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm Uhm I was talking to another friend who was telling\nme oh he's going to see the Indonesian dance\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nin the gamallon and nuh he was saying and he was saying that\nya these are the tickets that are more available Then he says Singaporeans\nare so snobbish\n\n<$C> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nand I kind of shrivelled in my feet\n\n<$C> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$C> \n\nit's not that Singaporeans are snobbish that I think those\nwho are trained to those who go to ballets and all\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nand music halls they're all western classically-trained So\nso I I think not exposed enough to indigenous cultural works you know\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm ya\n\n<$C> \n\nand well\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nDid I tell you once I went I went with my entire Bible study\ngroup to The Glass Orchestra\n\n<$A> \n\nThe Glass Orchestra\n\n<$C> \n\nUh huh and because it's some um experimental group and\nhighly experimental and I kind of knew\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$C> \n\nthat I forgot you see So I said 'Why don't we all go ' and I\nbooked tickets for all of them and they almost died because\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$C> \n\nbecause the trained ones uh two most accomplished ones\nalmost died because it's like nothing orchestral that they know\n\n<$A> \n\nIt was that spaced out\n\n<$C> \n\nUh huh\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$C> \n\nand like 'What orchestra ' It's all broken pieces of glass\n\n<$A> \n\nOh that's why it's called The Glass Orchestra\n\n<$C> \n\nYa so it's like actually they tried to pattern um the the\nthe glass instruments um most of which were fashioned themselves They tried\nto to group them into the different sectors you know like the conventional\norchestra\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$C> \n\naccording to I don't know the pitch or something\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$C> \n\nand their works were original too So you've got to like\nthrow away all the conventional ways of listening and listen according to\nrhythm you know\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nand I found it very interesting because I could pick out\nwhen one movement ended or one piece ended and another girl who's like\nabsolutely tone-deaf sometimes and she's not trained you see and she's not\nvery exposed and she knew when it ended but the musician friends of mine my\ngoodness they just went 'To hell with it'\n\n<$A> \n\nWas it bad Wasn't it enjoyable\n\n<$C> \n\nUm it's enjoyable if you listen to it with a different ear\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$C> \n\nSo they were going 'I like Brahms so what am I doing '\n\n<$A> \n\nOh poor things\n\n<$C> \n\nYa but I was quite mad actually because it's like you're\nyou're just cloistered you know instead of broadening\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nWell uh different different ideas and I think all that talk\nall that reading up on post-modernism help\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm Uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nBy\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nBy the way\n\n<$C> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nthis is a recorded conversation\n\n<$C> \n\nYa I figured\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$C> \n\nBy the sound <unclear> word </unclear> she's going to have a\nlot of giggles Cos' it's something as natural as it can get I can't I can't I\ncan't control it\n\n<$A> \n\nOh same here\n\n<$C> \n\nYa I kind of <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nHow in the world do you transcribe giggles Do you

students coming in and <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I guess I won't be using much of that room because uh\nsince this is going to be at the workplace you know the workstation of\nwhoever is going to participate\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThen so it looks like most of the time except for the uhm\ncalibration which can be done not necessary in that room\n\n<$A> \n\nUh huh\n\n<$B> \n\nIt can be done outside too\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd the rest of it uhm who will done at the subjects' uh work\nworkstation\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd so you'll be running around carrying all your equipment\nand all that\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm ya maybe or rather the subject will be running around\n\n\nYa with the electrodes on\n\n<$A> \n\nI see oh but do you have to bring a new brief case of\nelectrodes and stuff like that\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm you mean over to NUH from here\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm no to your subjects\n\n<$B> \n\nUh no no no\n\n\nThey'll be in other words uhm after they finish up their\ncalibration which you know I could always do it outside\n\n<$A> \n\nUh\n\n<$B> \n\nuhm near where you work\n\n<$A> \n\nUh huh\n\n<$B> \n\nThen uhm after that she's free to move about and this time\nit'll be quite different in the sense that she won't have those uhm like the\nangle equipments attached so she'll only have like uh six electrodes attached\nto her and that's it\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nSo probably will be <unclear> word </unclear> on made easier\nfor her to move around\n\n<$A> \n\nUh huh\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> computer to monitor her movement\nand all that\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nShe has to cart that around you see\n\n<$B> \n\nYa but that would be placed at the workstation\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nAt uh huh you know where wherever she works\n\n<$A> \n\nGet them to provide you with the laptop\n\n<$B> \n\nYa that was what I was thinking\n\n\nMaybe you could borrow one from your department\n\n<$A> \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nYa it'll be a lot more convenient than carting one <unclear>\nword </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nYa in fact the spot I used when I was in nuh HP\n\n<$A> \n\nOh that's because Alex is there and then\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> give you laptops and all that\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm ya\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> probably a personal laptop\n\n\nWell you can ask you can borrow from Dr Tee\n\n\nHe's got a new one and he's quite happy with it\n\n<$B> \n\nOh dear\n\n<$A> \n\nwell it's a Macintosh\n\n<$B> \n\nUh huh\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nOh he has got every all the new facilities\n\n<$A> \n\nYa it's like he's so augh I can't stand him\n\n<$B> \n\nWell does he still play that games and make those noise\n\n<$A> \n\nUuh\n\n<$B> \n\nThe singing and\n\n<$A> \n\nOccasionally hoping that you're not around\n\n<$B> \n\nOh uhm\n\n\nGood after-work entertainment\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd he finally finished his notes so he can take a breather\nfor a while but Hadiah says she's chasing him\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat notes\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm for the short course\n\n\nHe helps out in the short course his lectures and all that\n\n<$B> \n\nHah\n\n\nUh huh\n\n<$A> \n\nSo he has to produce a set of notes\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nSo Hadiah has to chase him each time for the notes because\nit's late\n\n<$B> \n\nOh boy\n\n\nHe probably has too much to say\n\n<$A> \n\nBut I mean he actually he's involved in so many things\n\n\nHe's got so many projects running at same time\n\n<$B> \n\nAh\n\n<$A> \n\nand and he's also got a uhm poly student attached to him\n\n<$B> \n\nUh huh\n\n<$A> \n\nFor I don't know what they are doing but at the moment the\npoly student is doing a lot of calculations\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nOn molarity\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n\nWell in a way it's good\n\n\nIt keeps you really you know involved\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nOtherwise well make good use of his brain\n\n<$A> \n\nI asked him how come he took so many things\n\n\nThen he said oh he just want to test his limits\n\n\nSee how far he can stretch\n\n<$B> \n\nHe\n\n\nYa\n\n\nPrecisely\n\n\nAfter all he's talented so uh gifted so so you know got to squeeze\nevery bit out of him\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I guess it's alright for him because he's still single and\nall and all that\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nIf he has a family it can be quite <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm yep and besides uh well he's young and energetic so\n\n<$A> \n\nUh\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm but now that he has got a new

far\n\n<$B> \n\nI enjoyed the show yesterday uh\n\n<$C> \n\nHuh\n\n<$B> \n\nI thought it was quite good yesterday\n\n<$C> \n\nYa okay lah\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$C> \n\nso far it's been positive because there are some people can't\nmake the link\n\n<$B> \n\nOrh orh orh\n\n<$C> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know what the link is lah but I assume it was trying\nto show that if your foundation not strong in both cases you will collapse or\nsomething like that\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm that that that can also\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd some you will have someone that is uh the strong will\nsurvive\n\n<$B> \n\nYa you know ya there are so many ya\n\n<$C> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> someone to link\n\n<$B> \n\nI just want to see the parallel between the two situations\nlah\n\n\nYa a lot of people left without realising what happened\n\n<$C> \n\nNo but uhm what we actually we haven't yet experiment\nexperimented as in asking people two days later\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n\nYou need sometime for it to sink in\n\n<$C> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> Ya lah I told uh we I don't know\nyet\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$C> \n\nIf they can come to a realization two days later\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$C> \n\nthey can still find for me because\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$C> \n\nAs you're watching it it's just <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nYa it may because you're too engrossed with the show right\nand everything else in it you know\n\n<$C> \n\nYa ya you still don't want them to make the analysis then\n\n<$B> \n\nCorrect ya\n\n<$C> \n\nBut I don't know you see\n\n\nActually it's basically what we're trying to put in of course is\nentrapment\n\n<$B> \n\nEntrapment nuh\n\n<$C> \n\nYa because getting uh because we're thinking of re-staging\nit so what we want made clearer\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$C> \n\nCould be the the you know that the trap lah because <unclear>\nword </unclear> physically trapped and uh Kim Kim is trapped by\nSingaporeanness\n\n<$B> \n\nOh I see <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$C> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> she got to pay for <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n\nI got to go\n\n\nI can't\n\n\nThe difficulty of letting go the\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$C> \n\nyou know Alan breaking free going\n\n<$B> \n\nCorrect ya\n\n<$C> \n\nRanching going out of the house etcetera\n\n\nAll a lot of uh and the idea of uh uh death\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$C> \n\nFather's death that traps her growth\n\n\nThe the the people death that <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$C> \n\nTaxes lah in life in in living in Singapore also maybe nuh\nbeing trapped by your job uh and you can't <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nYou know actually I think the play itself has a lot to offer\n\n\nI'm I'm glad you're you're planning to re-stage it lah\n\n<$C> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nI think too many of these plays here get done once and then\nget shelved and not you know not done again nuh\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's a pity Ya\n\n<$C> \n\nSo we must get the audience who can share\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$C> \n\nAfter that we you know see how lah see how which part we want\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay lah\n\n<$C> \n\nMore you know which part because you know the part where they\nthey caught and Jean cried out then you know I will die then I can walk\nthrough <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nYa correct ya\n\n<$C> \n\nYou see and so tonight we're going to uh we're make we're\nmaking Jean say that earlier\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$C> \n\nbecause as the overlay takes place\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nUh audience gets caught up with the effect rather than the\ncontent you see\n\n<$B> \n\nI see\n\n<$C> \n\nSo we want to put that earlier uh slightly earlier\n\n\nWhen the <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nYa correct\n\n\nThat line is often left I mean it loses its impact\n\n<$C> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nYa correct\n\n<$C> \n\nSo maybe it is not that the maybe it's a bit of the script a\nbit of the delivery\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nso you <unclear> word </unclear> with testing the the script\nout\n\n<$B> \n\nYa I think this' the best time to test whatever you want to\ndo right huh\n\n<$B> \n\nFairly experimental at the moment\n\n<$C> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$C> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I like I like the show lah\n\n\nI I thought it was quite well produced\n\n<$C> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> the effect\n\n<$C> \n\nThe first night my god the audience\n\n<$B> \n\nI know\n\n\nWan Hui was telling me the audience were were they were laughing\nat every line\n\n<$C> \n\nTuesday was a more you know more intelligent audience\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$C> \n\nbecause they followed the play\n\n<$B> \n\nAh\n\n<$C> \n\nThe first night they even laughed at the Singlish\n\n<$B> \n\nOh god\n\n<$C>

lah\n\n<$B> \n\nUh because some <unclear> word </unclear> I was walking out\nthey were talking to me because they knew I was working\n\n<$C> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nYa with you\n\n\nYa <unclear> word </unclear> whether I knew inside info\n\n<$C> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nMost of them didn't catch the parallel you know\n\n<$C> \n\nMost of them didn't\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nThey enjoyed the acting\n\n<$C> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nThey enjoyed the acting the enjoyed the performance as a\nwhole but the parallels I mean they're intelligent to make correlations lah\n\n\nBut you know like never show whether that was what the playwright\nwanted to come across or director wanted to come across\n\n\nSo kind of like that lah\n\n<$C> \n\nNever mind lah\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$C> \n\nThat one that one we can we can

actually she's I think like secretarial or\nadministrative support to\n\n<$B> \n\nTo\n\n<$A> \n\nHer boss lah\n\n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat what's what what is it doing\n\n\nAre they a research group or what\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm oh Andersen Consulting does uh these you see they have\nclients\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nand the clients ask them to do computer packages for them or\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\ntraining sessions and stuff like that\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm uhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nSo they have to present proposals and all lah\n\n\nSo he will I think provides uhm support lah\n\n\nAdministrative support\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nYa like uh maybe when they need certain things then she like\nwhen they need you know information on stuff like this she'll come down and\nget it\n\n<$B> \n\nOh so fun\n\n<$A> \n\nSo ya so the main actually the main bulk of the work is done\nby con the consultants\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> consultants they pay them quite a\nlot so I I hope will will get to be one lah\n\n<$B> \n\nYa I hope I hope\n\n<$A> \n\nYa so actually ya so she said see how lah\n\n\nSo consultants are the ones who actually do up the proposal you see\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nand you know get the information and write up the stuff\n\n\nSo I think for her she just you know provides support lah\n\n<$B> \n\nSo she does the running about and gathering the information\nlah\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm I don't know about the running about\n\n\nThis is the first time I've heard her coming here to get\ninformation ya\n\n<$B> \n\nAh\n\n<$A> \n\nI think probably the consultants have to do it themselves\n\n<$B> \n\nUh eh so fun uh\n\n\nI hope one day she become a consultant\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I hope so too\n\n\nAnyway ya it sounds pretty interesting\n\n\nWhy don't you go into that too\n\n<$B> \n\nYa I can do research\n\n\nBut then how\n\n\nUh maybe they want things like accounting and and management\n\n<$A> \n\nNo I don't think so\n\n\nThey take in they they take in BA people as well\n\n<$B> \n\nHow Lang Lang Lang also\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I think so ya\n\n<$B> \n\nEh then maybe I can ask her\n\n<$A> \n\nYa ya

degree\n\n\nSo if you've got a masters I think that will be worth something\n\n<$B> \n\nYa maybe maybe I could\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nSo so how did you go to the you're

do how do you like the\nhairstyling you know\n\n\nVery good\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nShe's very impressed but then I think like make-up she was\nlike I don't know what she was looking for lah but actually like I mean what\ndo you expect\n\n\nLike miracles uh\n\n\nI mean what do you expect\n\n\nLike like those tsk you know those artists uh those Paris make-up\nartists uh\n\n\nLike super-models uh\n\n<$A> \n\nYa those models uh ya\n\n\nYa I well I don't think the the photos do a lot of justice to the\nmake-up lah but\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nI think it's also very important to remember who who the\nmodels are you see I mean because they are like normal you know\n\n<$B> \n\nOrdinary people\n\n<$A> \n\nYa ordinary people\n\n\nYou see so it's not like I mean not exactly like your Ah Lian Ah\nHui that sort lah but you know\n\n<$B> \n\nYa but\n\n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nYa so and sometimes you can't expect miracles really\n\n\nI mean of course you want to look good you know but uhm ya and\nthen some of these people may not be photogenic\n\n<$B> \n\nYa that's right\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know so it doesn't come off\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd you you don't have all those touch-ups and photography\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n\nAh tell your sis if she wants uh\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nshe can come over to my place\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nand have a look at my Dayspring album\n\n<$B> \n\nYa ya ya okay\n\n<$A> \n\nAh because uh then you know to see if she wants before if she\nwants uh that sort of photographs before she signs up lah otherwise\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nyou know if it's not to her expectation then you know seven\nhundred and ninety dollars is a lot of money to spend for that\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nThen she can also see the make-up\n\n\nI I really like Dayspring's uhm make-up artist did really\n\n<$B> \n\nCatherine\n\n<$A> \n\nuhm no no that one is uh Lancome\n\n\nThat one is separate\n\n\nThat one I got for the day\n\n<$B> \n\nOrh\n\n<$A> \n\nBut uh the studio one because mine was a whole package and\nnuh it was together with studio make-up as well\n\n<$B> \n\nEh uh uh uh\n\n<$A> \n\nSo the lady did it very nicely\n\n\nI was like whoa can't even recognise myself\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nYa I saw I saw\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> turned out\n\n\nI think the photos turned out quite quite good lah\n\n<$B> \n\nYa ya\n\n<$A> \n\nSo uhm ya if she wants to you can ask her lah <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nIn fact I think I think your photos you look very good in\nyour photographs\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I mean in the studio photo I take uh\n\n\nHuh\n\n<$B> \n\nYes yes yes yes\n\n<$A> \n\nNot like myself like that\n\n\nSo like whoa okay\n\n<$B> \n\nYa enhanced lah enhanced lah\n\n<$A> \n\nRemember <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nYa but Hans oh oh enhanced\n\n<$B> \n\nEnhanced\n\n\nHans like ya Hans\n\n<$A> \n\nLike goldfish eyes\n\n\nHe can't get over it\n\n\nSo like so sad because he's really the photogenic one you know\n\n\nI'm the one who's not\n\n\nSo I say oh you got no problem lah you know\n\n\nSo when the photos turned out it's like why am I like staring like\nthat\n\n\nSo I've to find excuses you know\n\n\nNo lah maybe sleepy that day no maybe headache lah\n\n<$B> \n\nMaybe he should have looked into a flower <unclear> word\n</unclear> looking\n\n<$A> \n\nYa he's <unclear> word </unclear> disappointed but I mean I\nstill think he looks good\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause he's really very photogenic\n\n\nWhen you take him un unawares uh\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nHe comes out very nicely\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nfor some reason or other\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nThat's why I told you lah when I pin up his hair\n\n\nQuite good\n\n<$B> \n\nSome some people it it's it's like this you know whether the\ncamera likes you or not\n\n<$A> \n\nya\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nSome it's like turns out really good and also I think it\ndepends on the photographer's skill and the kind of background\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nLike uhm there was once I I wore this red dress\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm uhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nto go to this friend's wedding so she took photographer like\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nI looked normal lah you know goggy\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd all that When I went to take then the same day that\nafternoon\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nI went to take uhm a passport photograph and uhm my IC photo\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nYa ya oh ya you're telling me\n\n\nVery nice\n\n<$A> \n\nYa then like ya quite good\n\n\nSo I thought ya I suppose it depends on who's taking it as well as\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nThe kind of uhm background that you have then\n\n\nYa lah a lot of factors\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nwhether it's outside indoors or outdoors so all that Burn\nmust bear in mind lah\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nI mean she can look really wonderful for studio and she may\nlook really wonderful on that day but the photos may not turn out that well\nyou see\n\n<$B> \n\nYa I think so you know\n\n\nThat's true\n\n<$A> \n\nYa so just tell her to be realistic and wake up you know\n\n<$B> \n\nYa lah that that's it like she must she must do her research\nall lah\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nI guess she's a\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause she's not so too keen on on Jokim\n\n<$B> \n\nNo she she she wants she she's gonna ya she she's not too\nlike wow about his make-up but she she's going to take him on and\n\n<$A> \n\nOh she's going to take him on nuh\n\n<$B> \n\nIf if since he agrees to take her on so okay lor\n\n<$A> \n\nUh okay fine\n\n\nLike Jo quite funny uh\n\n\nLike he just decides okay six hundred dollars\n\n<$B> \n\nMaybe he's been calculating you know in his mind\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n\nNo actu I I don't know lah I think based on what I know of Jo he\nwill like look at you and and the person and he thinks that\n\n<$B> \n\nHe can afford it\n\n<$A> \n\nHe can work with you and ya I mean <unclear> word </unclear>\nyour budget lah\n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nand then of and then he will like talk to you and then if he\nthinks he likes working with you then okay you know he doesn't mind\n\n\nThe money is not that important\n\n<$B> \n\nAh\n\n<$A> \n\nBut let's say if you know he doesn't really like you very\nmuch\n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nand he thinks you're very calculative and all that sort of\nthing\n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nhe doesn't really click with you then I don't think he will\ngive you the the discount\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nI think that's how he works\n\n\nI mean I I haven't told him this lah but I've been observing him\nyou see\n\n<$B> \n\nAah\n\n<$A> \n\nSo\n\n<$B> \n\nBut he's mighty generous\n\n<$A> \n\nYa he's he's quite fun lah I mean he will do do that for the\nsake of friendship or for the sake of you know ya\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nof feelings lah you know you qing that type of thing\n\n<$B> \n\nOrh\n\n<$A> \n\nYa yau qeng\n\n<$B> \n\nbecause ya ya oh because like ya when he when I first met him\nI thought like he like quite business-like\n\n\nI thought\n\n<$A> \n\nYa but then later on he like kind of warmed up lah\n\n<$B> \n\nYa and became himself and showed us his topper\n\n\nI like was very shocked like he really went to the room and take\nout stuff and like showed us like eh\n\n<$A> \n\nYa

what you've been doing\nduring your holidays\n\n<$A> \n\nOh ya I've got to start telling you what I've been doing\nduring this holidays\n\n\nUh not very many days are there\n\n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nNo you mean when Kim Tok went away uh uh holidays began\nalready what\n\n<$A> \n\nKim Tok went away on Saturday night\n\n<$B> \n\nYa ya\n\n\nSo they were on holiday already right\n\n<$A> \n\nOh yes\n\n\nYa actually they were on holiday\n\n\nSo far actually what what did we do to them uh\n\n<$B> \n\nBut did he take leave\n\n<$A> \n\nNo he didn't\n\n<$B> \n\nOh I see\n\n<$A> \n\nBut what he did was that you know he stayed back in the\nmorning like worked here two hours while I went to do my driving\n\n\nI told you I took my test failed you know\n\n<$B> \n\nYa that's right that's right\n\n<$A> \n\nSo the last week everyday I was out on the road\n\n<$B> \n\nOh I see I see\n\n\nSo you mean you had like intensive training during the\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I had I had a full four days or five days prior to that lah\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then there were no baby-sitters because all the all the\nNavigators staff girls were in camps in church camps and the Navigators camp\nand Teen NavTeens camp you know\n\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> camps you know\n\n<$B> \n\nOh oh ya that's right\n\n<$A> \n\nSo I told him please lah just stay back and nuh just keep an\neye on the kids and work here\n\n<$B> \n\nYa that's right ya\n\n<$A> \n\nActually they're alright you know\n\n<$B> \n\nAh\n\n<$A> \n\nJust need somebody to keep an eye you see\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's right\n\n<$A> \n\nSo he worked here and then he went to the office\n\n\nSo let's see uh\n\n\nBut he took one morning off to bring them to the beach uh to catch\ncrabs uh\n\n<$B> \n\nOh ya lah that's right\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nSo but then before that how did you do your driving\n\n<$A> \n\nOh I've <unclear> word </unclear> twice a week only you know\n\n<$B> \n\nOh then how did you do it\n\n\nWhen uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nOh <unclear> word </unclear> Benjamin is in school\n\n<$B> \n\nOh I see I see uh\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nSo you had to arrange it lah\n\n<$A> \n\nYa so I don't have to arrange it because Benjamin goes to\nschool so I timed it such that uh I will come back in time to make lunch for\nhim you see\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nHe comes back by twelve\n\n<$B> \n\nSo that means the instructor will come and pick you uh\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no no I go to the driving school to uh I <unclear> word\n</unclear> driving from driving school\n\n<$B> \n\nOh I see and then they'll take you on the course\n\n<$A> \n\nAh then they take me on the course lah\n\n<$B> \n\nOh I see\n\n<$A> \n\nAh then it's a one-hour forty minutes deal\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nSo hundred minutes so I'll take a bus to the driving school\nthat's about twenty twenty-five minutes and then uh\n\n<$B> \n\nWhere is that\n\n<$A> \n\nBukit Batok you know near Julie's house\n\n<$B> \n\nOh so it's alright lah ya\n\n<$A> \n\nVery near\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nSo I'll come back\n\n\nBy the time when I come back it's time to get lunch ready and then\nBenjamin will be home lah\n\n\nThat is the reason\n\n<$B> \n\nOh I see but it it costs a lot nuh\n\n<$A> \n\nHuh\n\n\nCost a lot uh\n\n<$B> \n\nDoes it\n\n\nYa I'm sure\n\n<$A> \n\nAh ya anyway\n\n<$B> \n\nYa that's right because like now the whole thing I think you\nknow it's so costly\n\n<$A> \n\nThousand over you know\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nThousand over\n\n<$B> \n\nSo if you have to take it again\n\n<$A> \n\nNo need lah\n\n\nActually see the school is uh one thing that's good about them uh\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat they do is that they bring you uh for the circuit and\nthen uh it's about how many lessons uh\n\n\nI was I was a bit slow lah\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm Uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nyou know I think the younger drivers they learn it for about\nhalf far far faster than me\n\n<$B> \n\nOh I see\n\n\nSo you mean it's all in whether you take it again or not and all\nthat\n\n<$A> \n\nNo actually it's up to me\n\n<$B> \n\nthe base cost is the same\n\n<$A> \n\nUh no no it's up to me you see\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nFor example I took about thirty two lessons with them you\nknow\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nSo but out of thirty two lessons uh fourteen lessons uh\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nUh fourteen or sixteen I think half of it or more than half\nwere on the circuit you know\n\n<$B> \n\nOh I see\n\n<$A> \n\nThat means they teach you do all those parking lah all those\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nYa which is the essential lah\n\n<$A> \n\nAh Uh huh\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then uhm the second uh half of it nuh was on the road\n\n<$B> \n\nOh I see\n\n<$A> \n\nSo after that you see at the at different stages they pass\nyou you know\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nYou must pass the fourth stage uh\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nMust get less than thirty points before they allow you to go\nto the fifth stage you see\n\n<$B> \n\nOh I see\n\n<$A> \n\nThen when you finish the fifth stage uh you're supposed to\nget less than twenty points before they allow you to sit for the test you\nknow\n\n<$B> \n\nSo you never had to go on the road lah\n\n<$A> \n\nNo I went on the road\n\n<$B> \n\nOh you did\n\n<$A> \n\nI did you know\n\n<$B> \n\nSo that means you did pass all the stages\n\n<$A> \n\nI passed all the stages\n\n<$B> \n\nAiyoh\n\n<$A> \n\nSo right now uh when I sat for the exams uh\n\n<$B> \n\nAh ah\n\n<$A> \n\nthey thought that I should be able to make it lah Fifty\npercent lah\n\n<$B> \n\nAh ah ah ah\n\n<$A> \n\nyou know as good as that\n\n<$B> \n\nI see I see\n\n<$A> \n\nSo now that I fail\n\n<$B> \n\nAh\n\n<$A> \n\nI can just go back to school and take one lesson you see\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nJust the minimum of one only\n\n<$B> \n\nI see I see No but what I mean is that when you go through\nthe test suh\n\n<$A> \n\nUh huh\n\n<$B> \n\nyou have to start all over again\n\n<$A> \n\nYes yes\n\n<$B> \n\nOh I see\n\n\nNo lah but I think you shouldn't take just one you should take\nmore than one because it's a matter of practice\n\n<$A> \n\nBut you know it's so costly you know\n\n<$B> \n\nI know but then the thing is that driving is practice you see\n\n<$A> \n\nJust more time uh\n\n<$B> \n\nYa it's just practice it's not because you see even if you\npass uh by chance uh\n\n<$A> \n\nUh huh\n\n<$B> \n\nthen after that you're not that confident driving on the road\ntoo you you still it's a matter of practice\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's true you know\n\n<$B> \n\nYa so that's why actually you might as well put in that\neffort and then get it through you know\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nrather than because if you keep delaying it also\n\n<$A> \n\nThat's true\n\n<$B> \n\nYa because when can you take the next test\n\n<$A> \n\nAugust\n\n\nMy next test is in August\n\n<$B> \n\nOh so between then and now I mean you you need at least to\ndrive a couple of times a month\n\n<$A> \n\nI do need uh\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nI do need So what I was planning to do lah I thought what\nI'll do is that since I have learnt the basic skills from them uh\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nI use the same skills and go to a private one that's half the\ncost you see\n\n<$B> \n\nYa ya I see\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know that means what I need is I I just need confidence\non the road\n\n<$B> \n\nYes yes that's right that's right\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know the circuit is no problem\n\n<$B> \n\nAh ya\n\n<$A> \n\nI didn't even get a single point in the circuit\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nyou know I mean I it was okay you see\n\n<$B> \n\nYa ya that's right\n\n<$A> \n\nParking was no problem even\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nSo I just need that confidence uh half hour\n\n<$B> \n\nOh you mean this one you go the one you go to is actually ran\nby the government\n\n\nIt's not a private one\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's a private one you know\n\n<$B> \n\nOh same lah\n\n<$A> \n\nBut it's a big private company\n\n<$B> \n\nOh I see\n\n<$A> \n\nbut uh they don't allow you to take more than two times a\nweek you know\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nSo when you book with them uh you only got maximum of two\ntimes a week to take you know\n\n<$B> \n\nOh I see\n\n\nSo the private one it means it's cheaper is it\n\n<$A> \n\nUh the the private one is cheaper\n\n\nPrivate means individuals lah\n\n\nI mean those uh you know that you used to learn from you see\n\n<$B> \n\nAh ya lah that's right\n\n<$A> \n\nwhereas the school lah they already had a system lah\n\n\nYou know they have already worked a system as to how\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nyou should drive how <unclear> word </unclear> you should see\nit\n\n<$B> \n\nOh ya\n\n<$A> \n\nwhat you should notice lah\n\n\nI mean they almost like basically train and instruct you\n\n<$B> \n\nYa it's quite professional lah\n\n<$A> \n\nYa quite professional you see\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nBut I think one of the disadvantage I find when I\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nI took a private one for about four times lah\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nJust to ride drive you know and see what's the difference you\nknow\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nI think in terms of uh skills and technicalities uh\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nthe school is superb lah\n\n<$B> \n\nYa that's right\n\n<$A> \n\nThey're they're really superb on that\n\n<$B> \n\nYa uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nBut the problem is because they're so trained to teach you\nthey don't give you a chance uh to think you know\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nto decide for yourself you see\n\n<$B> \n\nYa that's right\n\n<$A> \n\nSo when I drove on the road with this uh private one\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nit was very good\n\n\nI mean I I I applied what I learnt\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nhe didn't say anything he just let me drive\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nIn fact they were so confident I'll pass\n\n\nAll of them\n\n\nI think God just doesn't want me to kill anybody on the road or\njust kill myself kill my children whatever\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know\n\n<$B> \n\nNo I think it's basically\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm ya\n\n<$B> \n\nJust more practice\n\n\nThat kind of thing and you have I mean the confidence is also\ngained through driving it often enough\n\n<$A> \n\nThat's right lah\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't think I've got it often enough\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's right\n\n\nSo you probably just go to the private one and get it you know a\ncouple of times a week\n\n<$A> \n\nAh <unclear> word </unclear> so I've to\n\n<$B> \n\njust to keep up the momentum\n\n<$A> \n\nAh I mean it's far cheaper anyway\n\n\nI mean it's about uh well how much\n\n\nTwenty over dollars uh twenty over for uh one and a half hour\nsession you see whereas the school is about forty eight you know That's over\ntwice\n\n<$B> \n\nYa terrible uh\n\n\nWhen I was learning it I was like paying the most expensive school\nlah\n\n\nLambert's last time uh <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nOh Lambert's uh\n\n\nHow much was it\n\n<$B> \n\nYa eight fifty\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I know\n\n<$B> \n\nPer hour that kind of thing\n\n<$A> \n\nIn fact somebody was telling they only learned it for five\ndollars you know\n\n<$B> \n\nYa but that was ages ago lah\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nProbably Kim Tok's was free\n\n<$A> \n\nFree ya because he told me how did he learn driving\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> Malaysia I think\n\n\nWhat he did was that\n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nhe drove around you see\n\n<$B> \n\nYa that's right\n\n<$A> \n\nSo came back here he took a a driving licence and passed you\nknow\n\n<$B> \n\nYa ya that's right because he's confident on the road you see\n\n\nThat's why I remember some people who ride motorbikes and all uh\n\n<$A> \n\nUh\n\n<$B> \n\nafter they uhm you know they want to go to get their licence\nuh\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nthey they learn it very fast because you kind of have a bit\nmore road-sense already\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nYa that's why\n\n<$A> \n\nSo I think I'll I'll press on uh because I don't think I want\nto give up\n\n\nthe only thing is that whoa\n\n<$B> \n\nYa no you shouldn't\n\n\nI mean after that all that money you spent on it already\n\n<$A> \n\nNo thousand over dollars now you know\n\n<$B> \n\nYa that's right ya\n\n\nSo \n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's a matter of just you know keeping it up\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's only a pp uh that you know private cars you can't drive\nHuh otherwise it's you know it's a matter of practicing that's all\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's true you know\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's true\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nBut anyway I anyway that morning when I was doing my quiet\ntime uh <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nI mean the Lord gave a verse of Psalms Forty Two  says 'By\nday He will direct His love at night He He gives me a song'\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nand I thought it was quite good because uh you know the the\nmeaning of the the fact that He directed my His His love towards me uh\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nby allowing me to fail was quite encouraging you know\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nThen after I sent Kim Tok off to the airport it's so funny I\nwas I didn't realize how tired I was I was so geared up for the whole week\nfor this test suh\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nthat suddenly when when uh I I went to the airport after the\nwhole thing was over they told me I failed it was very nice you know\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nthis that this instructor was saying 'Oh no uh we regret we\ncan't give you you know'\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nThis time I'm I'm sorry and I got thirty one\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nI felt so relieved then but I went to the airport I was so\ntired and sleepy\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nSending him off I went to buy uh duck duck rice from the\nshop uh\n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nThen this man gave me back my change you know Ten dollars\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\ngive me four dollars and I was looking at the money I wasn't\nactually looking\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nI was looking and not looking you see\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd he thought that I was questioning his integrity He said 'Uh\nisn't it right Isn't it right ' I said 'No no no ya it's right I'm not\nlooking at the money I'm not thinking I'm just tired you know' And then he\ntold me say 'I teach you how to do some exercises These are Chinese martial\nart exercises' He <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nOh he really did uh\n\n<$A> \n\nYes he's so sweet you know He said some he gave me a name of\nthe what He said 'I I practise this and it's very good you know Help to\nrevitalize your your your zeng san uh\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nthey call zeng san you know\n\n<$B> \n\nAh ah ah\n\n<$A> \n\nSo I say 'Oh' So I told him 'No lah no lah Anyway\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nI'm so tired because I just failed my driving test lah'\n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know I just came and sent my husband off but I failed my\ndriving test\n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nSo he says 'How many times already ' I said 'First time' 'Aiyah\nfirst time no problem Very few people pass first try'\n\n<$B> \n\nYa that's right I passed my fifth time okay\n\n<$A> \n\n'A' but good lah you pressed on\n\n<$B> \n\nYa and then this Tun Tun passed first time because he\nquarelled with the instructor or rather after that he told the instructor 'Come\non' He argued and then he got through because\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nyou know last time it's not so scientific you know\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nit's not point system right\n\n<$A> \n\nOh ya ya ya\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's more a bit more judgemental So he argued argued argued\nand he came back he passed\n\n<$A> \n\nNo but now they're quite strict you know They're quite\nfierce about it you know\n\n<$B> \n\nYa that's right Now it's more scientific you see\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nSo it's more difficult\n\n<$A> \n\nIn fact they don't put any ar arguments and things like that\nyou know <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nYa that's right", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "e4058cff-4a72-48b3-a493-ac0370b8954b", "added":

wouldn't want to try to explain it\n\n<$B> \n\nI mean\n\n<$A> \n\nI I don't think that\n\n<$B> \n\nIn other words I mean if there is a life before it is\npossible it may not be possible but I think <unclear> word </unclear> it's\njust a theory\n\n\nBut it is quite likely you know that there should be cleared\n<unclear> word </unclear> live <unclear> word </unclear> before if that\nexplains why you know our Lord now\n\n<$A> \n\nNo I don't think so lah\n\n<$B> \n\nYa there it it explains what they cannot change Like for\nexample you know our family\n\n\nWhy are we born into certain family\n\n\nThings like that\n\n\nYa\n\n\nUhm social economic sort of you know conditions\n\n\nBut of course that you can come out of it too\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know and there have been cases of like you know like Tan\nTock Seng was a hawker\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> vegetable seller\n\n\nWell this is a hawker I guess same\n\n\nAnd uh you know and then he went rich <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nThere are lots people like that\n\n\nFrom rags to riches kind of story\n\n<$B> \n\nNot lots lah Carol\n\n<$A> \n\nQuite a lot right I mean\n\n<$B> \n\nI mean there are\n\n<$A> \n\nJust that we don't know like especially those back those from\nChina and all that\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nWhen they in to first work Now they they have they own land\nand\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> Carol no\n\n<$A> \n\nBuildings and stuff\n\n<$B> \n\nHistorical evidence shows uh shows that uhm historical\nevidence uh points to the fact that very few actually have made to to the\nupper echelon\n\n\nMost most of the collies that came here well maybe they became\nmiddle class over\n\n<$A> \n\nuhm uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nGenerations but they didn't like become rich overnight\n\n<$A> \n\nNot overnight lah of course not overnight\n\n\nThey worked very hard\n\n<$B> \n\nThey as <unclear> word </unclear> individuals did did not\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nBut their their the generation that follow after them\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nYa so you have got very few cases like people like Lok Yoon\nuh Tan Tok Seng\n\n\nThey came from China\n\n\nNow very few of those who like come out make it to the top\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nVery few\n\n\nIt is more likely that their descendants\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nHopefully do something about it\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nI suppose\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nWell our pastor don't believe in reincarnation\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nYa I think it is possible\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't think so\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> not possible either\n\n\nWhichever\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n\nI suppose you mean you can hold to your own beliefs lah\n\n<$B> \n\nBut it is just like God I mean sometimes you man I mean Oh\ndid you read the latest Readers' Digest\n\n<$A> \n\nOh on what\n\n<$B> \n\nSteven Hawkins\n\n<$A> \n\nNo\n\n<$B> \n\nHis his uhm his book The History of Time\n\n<$A> \n\nNo\n\n<$B> \n\nThat became <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nThat is the latest one is it\n\n\nI haven't read the latest\n\n<$B> \n\nUh hah\n\n<$A> \n\nNo\n\n<$B> \n\nIt is very interesting\n\n\nGo and read it\n\n\nIn fact one thing that led to the divorce of him and his wife was\nreligion cause he never believed in a god\n\n\nApparently he is the greatest synthesis after uhm Einstein\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd uh\n\n<$A> \n\nOh is it the is he the one who is presen pra paraplegic\n\n<$B> \n\nYes he is\n\n<$A> \n\nAh okay\n\n<$B> \n\nHe is very famous\n\n<$A> \n\nYa ya ya\n\n\nI remember the name\n\n<$B> \n\nYa Steven Hawkins\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nIf you read like the second part of Straits Times I think\nmany a time he's been featured already\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm ya\n\n<$B> \n\nSo any way they made one of his books into a movie and oh did\nyou go to for the film festival\n\n<$A> \n\nNo did you\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm no but

like that\n\n<$A> \n\nI is a British film you mean\n\n<$B> \n\nIt is a British film\n\n<$A> \n\nOh Ai yoh my friend went to see it and she said it was very\ngood also\n\n\nThey have you know you said it was very good so\n\n<$B> \n\nUh ah\n\n<$A> \n\nYa must go see it lah\n\n<$B> \n\nI figured that we get movies like after two months uh after\nAmerica has it\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nWell it is better than those days when you used to get them\nabout one year or two years later\n\n<$B> \n\nReally\n\n<$A> \n\nRemember those days it was like we get it so late\n\n<$B> \n\nAh right\n\n<$A> \n\nSix seven about a year later we get the film\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nYa but now it is almost quite quite close\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> Little Mermaid Little

\n\nCrazy\n\n<$A> \n\nI guess there is a backlog of movies to be shown you see\n\n\nSo\n\n<$B> \n\nBacklog\n\n<$A> \n\nI mean uhm because we've always been behind time right\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n\nYou

{"text": "<$A> \n\nWe are not having a formal debate we feel very\n\n<$B> \n\nSo what are you having\n\n<$A> \n\nUh just an informal discussion\n\n<$B> \n\nInformal discussion uh so how what kind of informal discussion\nyou uh uh is one side going to raise a point and the other side counter\ncounter yourself or what\n\n\nWhat are you going to do\n\n<$A> \n\nI mean maybe we could just tell you what uhm what we have to\nsay and then you know if you have anything to to\n\n<$C> \n\nAdd on or to ya you know\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm okay\n\n\nWho's uh supposed to propose\n\n<$A> \n\nMy the three of us\n\n<$B> \n\nThree of you right three of you all okay so speak when you are\nready\n\n<$C> \n\nWe shall start with the definition of code and we define code\nas being uhm oh ya from code uh he says that code is language and dialect and\nit includes even sign languages also and from <unclear> word </unclear> he\nsays that code is uhm a series of signs right and its uhm correspondent\nbetween form and meaning ya and uh and this excludes uhm the type of moral\nand uh so uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nSo uhm we think that uh it is not enough neither is it\nsufficient sorry it is not sufficient nor necessary 'cos you have to take\ncontext into account like uhm context will give you the utterance meaning\n\n\nFor example uh the cha kway teow you go to the cha kway teow man\nyou said one fifty he'll know it's uhm one fifty worth of cha kway teow but\nif you were to go out and say one fifty to any passerby uhm something will\nhappen\n\n<$D> \n\nI mean besides besides that uhm local and geographical\nvariations uhm for words like uhm gas and petrol uhm is American but petrol\nis more towards Singapore so uhm if you use the word gas in Singapore people\nmight think that if you wanna buy you wanna you know order a tank of gas for\nyour kitchen stove or something\n\n\nSo different ideas behind the words and uhm like Gail was saying\nfor the word home different people have different ideas or different values\nattached to it right\n\n<$C> \n\nBecause they experience uhm it differently I mean in the sense\nthat for some people home would be uhm very good uh very happy comfortable\nsort of idea whereas to some other people it might mean uhm like uh a broken\nhome where beatings and drunken well whatever ah you know that kind of thing\nya so it depends on experiences also\n\n<$B> \n\nSay opposition what what you want to say to their points so\nfar\n\n<$E> \n\nUhm I think what Gail says contradicts what Shirley says\nbecause Gail says that uhm in the definition of code you exclude world but\nthen according to Shirley uhm context would therefore include world so I\nthink that's contradiction there and uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nYa but we are sup we are proposing this motion right which\nshould that we are we define the motion as being a correspondents between\nform and meaning and we are saying that world is important also so that's why\ncontext's important\n\n<$E> \n\nYa but just now you exclude world\n\n<$F> \n\nYou said ya the definition of code ya that's why that's why we\nare propose ya it's not sufficient not <unclear> word </unclear> you know\n\n<$E> \n\nOkay okay uhm I'll do on that <unclear> word </unclear> our\ndefinition right uhm\n\n\nWhen you talk of code we would we also refer to it as a system of\nuhm meaning and form correspondents and uhm our code can be verbal and it can\nbe non-verbal is that uhm\n\n\nWhen we talk of verbal code we refer it to the same language and\nnon-verbal code will then include things like signals sign language body\nlanguage etcetera and when we talk about shared code uhm one question that\npops into mind is how shared is considered shared right\n\n\nUhm we'll like to define it as when two speakers uhm share a shared\ncode they have to be both uhm possessing adequate knowledge of this language\nin order to understand internal assumptions utterance meaning sarcasm\nidiomatic phrases etcetera\n\n\nSo this will constitute what shared means\n\n\nNow uhm for necessary and sufficient if you were to refer to Kobe\nfor logic uhm logic uhm what a necessary condition would mean would that be\nthat it it's a circumstance in which uhm <unclear> word </unclear> absence\nthe event cannot occur that is without a shared code putting it in this uhm\ncontext without a shared code we cannot have human communication right\n\n\nAnother example if we were to look oxygen and combustion we say\nthat oxygen is a necessary condition for combustion because without oxygen no\nconden no combustion can take place\n\n\nNow if we were to look at sufficient condition a sufficient\ncondition would be a circumstance in which in whose presence the event must\noccur\n\n\nFor example if we say that uhm combustion occurs then uhm oxygen\nmust be present\n\n\nBut oxygen is not a sufficient condition because you can have\noxygen being present and yet no combustion\n\n\nSo a sufficient condition would necessary uhm necessarily uhm uhm\nentail a subset of necessary conditions in that in this case if you want\ncondi combustion you need uhm you need oxygen and many other things many\nother things\n\n\nSo what do you understand \n\n\nThank you\n\n\nSo what we are saying is that uhm for human condition uh\ncommunication to take place we need we need we needs uhm we need a shared\ncode but this shared code is necessary as well as being sufficient\n\n\nBut being necessary is a subset of being sufficient you know\n\n\nAlright\n\n\nIf you were to look at the true table can can I draw out the truth\ntable\n\n<$B> \n\nBy all means\n\n<$E> \n\nOkay uhm \n\n\nIf we were to take necessary condition as p and sufficient\ncondition as q so uhm we do it this way\n\n\nSo if p is necessary condition ah p is sufficient condition and q\nis necessary condition neither necessary nor sufficient will be not bracket p\nor q so this case is true only when both p and q is false\n\n\nSo uhm if you want to say that this statement is true you have to\nprove to us that it is not necessary as well as not sufficient\n\n\nBut what we are trying to say that is that we are we we we can\nprove either of this three cases\n\n\nSee we can prove that it is just necessary or you can prove that it\nis just sufficient or you can prove that it is both necessary and and and\nsufficient and ours case stands here okay\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay \n\n<$E> \n\nRight and the last point is uhm for human communication\n\n\nWhen you talk about human communication we want to limit it to\nbeing uhm just effective communication in that uhm there must the hearer must\ndecode the message the same way that the speaker intends it so that is\neffective communication\n\n\nUhm so\n\n<$C> \n\nSo that's that uhm <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$E> \n\nWe are not saying that shared code is sufficient we are saying\nthat it is necessary\n\n\nThat means it encompasses it can encompass other things as well you\nsee\n\n<$G> \n\nIn fact in our definition of a shared code we've already\nincluded right we included non-verbal communication utterance meaning\n\n<$E> \n\nSo so the world is <unclear> word </unclear> we are saying\nthat a shared code\n\n<$C> \n\nBut you just\n\n<$E> \n\nWe are not saying that\n\n<$C> \n\nIn your definition you said that shared code uhm a code is\nform and meaning only you didn't say <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$F> \n\nWe we believe that it's part of it is an essential form and\nmeaning you see but you're going to\n\n<$C> \n\nSo you're going to have <unclear> word </unclear> column and\nsecond column\n\n<$F> \n\nYes because you see when you talk about under Jakobson right\nif you talk about when he talks about code under the functions of language\nright he uses it as the language that is used you see in in communication and\nthings like that and under that language itself right it is the verbal\nlanguage right what you say to each other\n\n\nAnd also other uhm signs like non-verbal language communication as\nwell as utterance meaning and all that\n\n\nIt all comes under the heading of language you see and as a result\nit comes under the heading of codes\n\n\nThat's how our definition comes about\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay now if I may interject uh for a while I think this this\ndebate is kind of a digressing a little bit from what you're supposed to be\ntalking about\n\n\nAh this thing about the the code you talk about whether it includes\nthe world or doesn't include the world\n\n\nIt's quite a <unclear> word </unclear> point really it's not a\npoint worth debating because you're given this you know in your two zero\nthree you're given this form meaning well thing right and your your well from\nyour reading okay you read it you read that shared code is a system a system\nof signs right system of signs and what is a sign\n\n\nA sign is a okay a sign is something which ties form and meaning\nright which is a you know the the classic Sausurrean definition of a sign\nwhere you\n\n\nNow when the the word sign is used by the structural linguists you\nknow from Sausure's time the way they use meaning there is not the same as\nthis framework which you've been given two zero three this form meaning world\nthis FMW thing\n\n\nIn fact this FMW thing okay this is just an incidental point which\nI'm just saying to you now\n\n\nIt's it's just an abstraction alright just a framework uh which Dr\nFerris is using himself okay which I personally I don't believe in okay\n\n\nThe kind of semantics that I do ah ah this to me this is this is\nbullshit okay but for your purposes for exam purposes you know if you \n\n\n\nalright\n\n\nSo when we talk about meaning in terms of uh the linguistic sign or\nwhatever sign uhm it does not necessarily refer to just this this M alone\nokay could refer to to your W as well\n\n\nBecause when we talk about meaning okay in the Sausurean sense it\ncan be sense as well as reference alright\n\n\nIt doesn't have to exclude a W so let's just get that aside for the\ntime being okay\n\n\nNow <unclear> word </unclear> okay uhm so now what you have to show\nas a proposition is that this this shared code uh is number one it's not\nnecessary and number two it's not sufficient\n\n\nYou have to show these two alright\n\n\nNow so far you haven't really come up with any uh argument any\nstrong argument you have mentioned something about okay the importance of\ncontext uh the cha kway teow thing right so that perhaps is an argument for\nwhy it's not sufficient but you haven't really argued why it is not necessary\nright\n\n\nOf course on your part as the opposition uh in a way you have an\neasier task because right they have to show the proposition has to show that\nit is one <unclear> word </unclear> not necessary as well as not sufficient\n\n\nRight you have to show both as the proposition\n\n\nAs the opposition all you have to do is to refute just one of these\nyou don't have to refute both right\n\n\nThey have to show both\n\n\nAll you have to do is refute one of those and your your case is\ndone right so in a sense it's easier for you so it depends on what kind of\nargument you come up with\n\n\nWho wants to take it up again\n\n<$D> \n\nOkay in other words you said that okay talking about if I\n<unclear> word </unclear> use Jan Jakobson's six elements of communication\nright he list down addresser addressee\n\n\nUhm sorry context message\n\n\nUhm contact and code as the six necessary constituents so you say\nthat if you say that the code a shared code is sufficient \n\n\nThat means you are not taking into account the other five uhm\nnecessary elements right So in other words you're saying that if I have a\nshared code uhm and I look at Angie Angie knows what I'm saying to her \n because what mental <unclear> word </unclear> thapy", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "22941e07-6d87-4fcb-8375-0a79c0f0687b", "added":

\n\nCountry and smack\n\n<$D> \n\nUh which one are you doing <o> laughs \n\n<$A> \n\nWe're talking about how spelling can be inconsistent right and\nthen uhm and then we say that it is inconsistent because we have one symbol\nrepresenting several sounds so we've been we need examples for different\nsymbols\n\n<$D> \n\nSymbol as in a phonetic symbol\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm spelling right\n\n<$D> \n\nSpelling symbol uhm sleigh and sleight\n\n<$A> \n\nSleight which sleight\n\n<$D> \n\nS L E I G H T\n\n<$A> \n\nIs that slight or sleight\n\n\nWhatever\n\n<$D> \n\nSlight sorry <o> laughs \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay what about uneconomical\n\n\nWhat do they mean\n\n<$E> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> it means a lot of letters take up a\nlot of space \n\n<$A> \n\nA lot of letters for what to\n\n<$E> \n\nTo spell a word\n\n<$A> \n\nA word\n\n<$B> \n\nA syllable\n\n<$A> \n\nOr sound a syllable a sound for example\n\n<$E> \n\nBut think it is a Ch that's if we pronounce it as cher but uhm\nyou need two letters to represent it\n\n\nIn phonetics only one symbol\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm not our phonetics though the American one right\n\n<$E> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay okay now if people think that spelling can be\ninconsistent and uneconomical etcetera what assumptions are they making about\nthe relationship between spelling and speech\n\n\nQuestion two\n\n<$B> \n\nThey're assuming that like uhm pronunci uhm spelling must\nreflect pronunciation and it represents it must represent the spelling must\nrepresent the sound of a the spelling of a word must represent the sound of a\nword\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay so it's like spelling should be phonological right okay\nso one letter should represent one sound\n\n\nNow why did people have this assumption\n\n\nWhat gave them the idea that oh when you write you should ex\nexactly represent how you speak\n\n\nWhat are the different explanations for this assumption\n\n\nBoon Leng\n\n<$C> \n\nUh I think in the past they they always think that language\nhas everything to do with writing so they always consider that writing is a I\nmean a a bit I think they're trying to reverse the <unclear> word </unclear>\nslowly\n\n\nI think it's an over-correction now\n\n<$A> \n\nAh what does what does over-correction mean\n\n<$C> \n\nThat means to say uh they they do correct these false notion\nto a to a very extreme degree\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay so instead of saying that now we should raise the\nstandard of ah speech to the standard of writing make them equal they\nactually make it even more important\n\n\nSo now they're saying the other way uh the other thing that writing\nshould represent speech\n\n<$C> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay what other explanations so you have besides\nover-correction\n\n<$C> \n\nUh they also because in the last in the past when they uh when\nthey were learning how to read and write they they were using uhm I mean the\nstudents actually have to pronounce the word so for them uhm the words I mean\nah they equate them with uh <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nSo uh but because the the kind of education uh system that we have\nnowadays is that we just look at the word and the word forms a mental\nimpression on our heads so because the system is different I should think\nthat uhm whoever is uh formulating this assumption must have got it from his\nah learning experiences\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm okay so the old habits of reading and writing affected\ntheir view of what spelling should be\n\n\nThen one more thing about maybe they saw a very close connection\nbetween writing and speech and therefore they assume that it must be exactly\nthe same\n\n\nWhat sort of close connection do they see between writing and\nspeech\n\n\nSoh Suan\n\n<$E> \n\nUhm because <unclear> word </unclear> they use symbols to\nrepresent the word I mean the character which they are describing\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd what do you mean by symbols\n\n\nIf we say symbols we can say the traffic sign STOP is a symbol so\nwriting is not like a traffic sign right\n\n\nWhat's so special about writing\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm writing has only one particular spoken symbol attached to\nit so in a way it's a very close link you see because the traffic signs they\nI mean you can see them for what they for what they mean but you cannot utter\nanything about them\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay and also different countries can use the same sign but\nthey can say that that sign is stop sign that sign is a sign for uh for\nvehicles to ting xia lai which is Mandarin and all that right\n\n\nSo what about the character ren that you saw\n\n\nWell what about all the Chinese languages\n\n\nDo they pronounce it in different ways\n\n<$C> \n\nThey do they do\n\n<$A> \n\nBut how come your characters' the same\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\n<o> laughs  So Chinese languages is uhm special example\nright it's a special example okay\n\n\nSo if you think of STOP maybe S T O P if an Indian came along he\ncan't pronounce STOP in Tamil I mean the S T O P right or he can't a Chinese\ncan't say anything right when he sees S T O P so in that way maybe they saw\nthe close connection between writing and speech\n\n\nHello <o> laughs \n\n\nOkay then let's go on to question four okay\n\n\nWhen we were we were saying that people have uh wrong assumptions\nabout what the relationship between writing and spelling it's okay\n\n\nOne thing was that they over-corrected their idea that now speech\nshould be very important and language should written language should reflect\nspeech\n\n\nAnother thing was that they saw a very close connection between\nspeech and writing and so they assume therefore that they must be exactly the\nsame okay\n\n\nSo if we think that such views are wrong how do you think you can\nexpress the relationship better the relationship between speech and writing\n\n<$E> \n\nUnder true functions\n\n<$A> \n\nSorry\n\n<$E> \n\nThey've close connection but ah they have speech and writing\nas different functions and they occur in different contact\n\n<$A> \n\nRight so can you give examples of that different functions\netcetra\n\n<$E> \n\nUh speech has uhm paralinguistic function but uh writing\ndoesn't have\n\n<$A> \n\nFor example\n\n\nWhat do you mean\n\n\nParalinguistic features\n\n<$E> \n\nUhm their gestures their facial expressions ah but you cannot\nuhm put that into writing\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay that's one\n\n\nWhat else\n\n\nChoon Kiat\n\n<$B> \n\nUh speech most of the time it'll be uhm spontaneous whereas\nfor writing it'll it'll be more of a pre-planned thing so you can phrase\nwhatever you want to say whatever you put down on paper beforehand for\nwriting a a speech\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd uh there'll be pauses as well for speech it won't be such\na smooth flow as as writing\n\n\nBasically writing would be for more formal context where where\nspeech is more of a social sort of a context\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay any other points\n\n\nBoon Lai have you caught your breath yet <o> laughs \n\n\nDo you have any points\n\n<$F> \n\nUh just that writing develop because of a need for record\n\n<$A> \n\nRight\n\n<$F> \n\nWhich speech could not do\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy not\n\n<$F> \n\nUhm speech is limited by memory and ya writing is not writing\ncan be passed down to future generations\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay so writing can be permanent and speech is transient\n\n\nWhat else\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm there is the distance factor between speech is limited by\nthe range of voice but writing you know I mean is not it have it can travel\ngreater distances\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay that's not taking uh technology into account right\nbecause like people can say oh but we can call people\n\n<$C> \n\nOh ya\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd all that okay alright then Five A\n\n\nWhat are the two major sets of principles from which spelling\nsystem of English is based\n\n<$F> \n\nIs it etymology right and\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd\n\n<$F> \n\nAnd phonology\n\n<$B> \n\nPhonology\n\n<$F> \n\nPhonology\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay so what about isomological\n\n<$C> \n\nThe basis of uh the the the source of which the rest comes\nfrom dictionary uh so the the I think the dictionary makers they the\ndictionary wri the writers they they try to insofar as possible to trace the\nuh uh the etym the the root the word the etymological roots and uh as close a\nrepresentation as possible\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay so one thing is that it the spelling of the word need\nnot be the Latin form or the French form but then because they were concerned\nabout showing etymology so they thought they should reflect in the spelling\nthe source of which the word was borrowed okay\n\n\nSo you have examples like island where initially there was no 's'\nright but they thought that it came from insular so they added the 's'\n\n\nBut what about other uhm reasons for etymological spellings\n\n\nNeed it be a deliberate attempt\n\n<$F> \n\nAre you are you talking about democratic nature that Johnson\nfixed it etymologically because he could not decide on which one to use so\nit's like\n\n<$A> \n\nWho did he follow then\n\n<$F> \n\nHe followed conservative right\n\n\nSo Uhm conservative means it's not <unclear> word </unclear> it's\nnot a regional variation of English so he he went back to the past\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay uhm what about the very fact of borrowing a word from\nLatin or French\n\n\nOnce you borrow you do you spell it your own way or do you spell\nit their way\n\n<$D> \n\nThey anglicise it\n\n\nIt's not the the their own way modified their spelling\n\n<$A> \n\nAh Latin words\n\n\nOkay what about French words like beauty cigarette\n\n\nWhen you see the 'ette' you know immediately it's not English it's\nFrench right do you <o> laughs \n\n\nIntuitively maybe hopefully anyway so what about that\n\n\nIt's not deliberate right\n\n\nThey didn't say that oh we want to reflect in our language that\ncigarette came from French but it's just immediate borrowing right\n\n\nOkay so there are different explanations for etymological\nspellings\n\n\nWhat about phonological\n\n\nHow did that start\n\n<$F> \n\nUhm are you referring to ah older words which were words\nwhich were spelt in a way which was pronounced in the past like for example I\nthink psychology was the p-s was was pronounced in the past right\n\n\nWas it\n\n<$A> \n\nWas it\n\n<$F> \n\nWas it somebody words\n\n\n\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat's the point then if that is the case\n\n<$F> \n\nI believe it's not to confuse people right like you ah it's\nbeen around for so long\n\n<$A> \n\nOh so you don't eliminate the p\n\n<$B> \n\nBut what I thought about phonological is like to reflect an\nimage of sound\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nThey want the the spelling to be an image of that sound\n\n<$A> \n\nRight so the point that he was trying to say is that even\nthough now we don't pronounce persychology <o> laughs \n\n\nIn the past maybe they did but I think the 'k-n' one know ya they\nmight have pronounced 'k-n' and then we stop pronouncing the 'ker' or\nsomething like that okay but then the spellings do show the previous\nphonological system\n\n\nOkay but phonological system means that they tried to have a\nletter for a particular sound right and to reflect pronunciation\n\n\nSo how did that start\n\n\nAt the very beginning they didn't have alphabets right\n\n\nWhat did they have in old English time\n\n\nThe runic system\n\n<$C> \n\nThe runic system\n\n<$A> \n\nThen who brought the alphabet\n\n<$F> \n\nRomans Romans\n\n<$C> \n\nRomans Christianity and\n\n<$A> \n\nChristianity\n\n<$F> \n\nChristianity\n\n<$A> \n\nSo the scribes started using the Roman alphabet then you\nthink the Roman alphabet would of course be used for which language\n\n<$C> \n\nLatin\n\n<$A> \n\nSo is the sound system of Latin like Old English\n\n<$F> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nOf course not\n\n\nSo they must adapt a spelling system which is for another language\ninto their own Old English\n\n\nThen what happened What are the problems that arise\n\n\nTracy\n\n<$E> \n\nThe uhm the Old English sounds didn't match the Latin sounds\n\n<$A> \n\nSo what did they do\n\n<$E> \n\nThey borrowed the runic letters\n\n<$A> \n\nThey borrowed runic \n\n<$E> \n\nRunic runic letters\n\n<$A> \n\nYa right that's one way\n\n<$E> \n\nAnd the introduce the <unclear> word </unclear> combination\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay and what about the next page",

right\n\n\nTake the nine o'clock one is it 'cos normally it should be the\nother way round\n\n\nYou got two classes nine and ten usually it's the ten that's full\nand nine is empty\n\n\nThese people can't wake up in time\n\n\nYes just now the nine o'clock class is more than full about\nseventeen\n\n\nOkay right now questions one and two any problems with those\n\n\nOkay any problem with those\n\n\nQuestion one we have the application and s matrix to <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n\nOkay for question two question two we've to find the unitary\ncondition\n\n\nAny problem with that\n\n\nNo right so let's move on to questions three four and five\n\n\nThe basic uh emphasis here is to make s matrix together with all\nother known matrices\n\n\nOkay for example you have t z you have other matrices like in y\nyour h your hybrid okay\n\n\nNow we haven't got time to cover everything so for this particular\ntutorial we'll just look at this t matrix and the z matrix right\n\n\nI want you all to feel comfortable with s matrix\n\n\nI know it's a very new matrix that uh forcing on you all but I hope\nthat after this tutorial you'll be able to see that the s matrix is but one\nout of many matrices that you can use okay\n\n\nAnd even if you start out with your s matrix and let's say you need\nto transform it to another matrix there is no problem\n\n\nLet's say for question uh three or question four rather for\nquestion four you find that the t matrix actually is more suitable for\npractical application\n\n\nThere's no problem as a conversion formula between the two so you\ncan always switch from one to the other okay\n\n\nRight so come in come in\n\n\nRight first of all we try to establish the relationship between the\ns and the t and that's our question three\n\n\nOkay now this is your two port network\n\n\nNow two port network you find that to assume that your symbols are\nof these four okay\n\n\nWith that you find that your sketching representation is just\nsimply this okay\n\n\nNow this way of writing things assumes that your A1 and A2 are\nindependent parameters and your B1 and B2 are dependent parameters\n\n\nThis is not unreasonable okay\n\n\nA network like this you ought to know what you are feeding your\nsystem with and you're interested in knowing how that system responds okay so\nfor the s matrix that is our presumption\n\n\nWe know what we have as input and we want to know the response of\nthe system to the input\n\n\nNow what if your emphasis changes\n\n\nWhat if you change your set of independent parameters\n\n\nOkay so for this question we are going to look at the possibility\nthat A2 and B2 are known right A2 and B2 are known and you're supposed to\nfind A1 and B1\n\n\nSo in other words this becomes your independent set and this\nbecomes your dependent set okay\n\n\nSo let's get that from this particular set\n\n\nAlright uh it's awkward to have your left hand side comprising B1\nis your dependent but this B2 is independent so let's shift B2 over to the\nother side and uh shift the A1 which is supposed to be dependent over to the\nleft okay\n\n\nSo you will have right so let's re-write the familiar set of\nsketching equations in this form\n\n\nNow once I write it in this form I can then assume that this is a\npair of pair of simultaneous equations in two nodes\n\n\nIf my nodes are B1 A1 this whole lot on the right hand side is\nassumed to be known okay so in that case how to get hold of my unknowns\n\n\nWell simultaneous equations there are lots of ways of solving it\n\n\nLet's use your Kramer's rule okay <unclear> word </unclear> uh\n\n\nYou all have heard of Kramer's rule is it\n\n\nOkay so this you can solve by Kramer's rule\n\n\nNow let's I won't go through the mechanical assume that we can\nsolve it there you find that when you end up with this set of equations\n\n\nOkay so you'll end up with this set of equations\n\n\nRight what's so important about this set of equations <unclear>\nword </unclear>\n\n\nFirst thing let's change the symbols okay\n\n\nWhile you're sketching parameters we chose this set of symbols\nbecause they represent certain things\n\n\nNow since I want to look at the same system but from a different\nperspective I have to change the symbols\n\n\nI let you change it to this big A1 big B1 and on this side I have\nbig A2 big B2 okay usually written in this order\n\n\nNow here let me fit this arrows\n\n\nFor <unclear> word </unclear> matrix we normally draw in this\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nLet me fit the arrows so that they correspond\n\n\nOkay now what do we have here\n\n\nRight we <unclear> word </unclear> it with a if there's a\none-for-one correspondence so what you want you can change to big A1 small B1\nyou can change to big B1 okay\n\n\nSmall B2 this red arrow here I can change to the green arrow here\n\n\nPhysically it's the same wave all I'm doing is just giving it a\ndifferent name okay giving it a different symbol\n\n\nSo that means just a small B2 can can can be replaced by a big B2\nand this small A1 here can be represent oh this should be 2 sorry this one\ncan be represented by B2 okay\n\n\nAlright uh this whole lot here can be reformatted in another form\nas another matrix\n\n\nOkay and we find that if we call the new matrix t then I have okay\nthen I have this new matrix which is your transmission matrix in that form\nand uh I find that uh there's a one-for-one correspondence\n\n\nOkay if I'm given my s matrix and I got one more t matrix this one\nis given by this this is given by that and so on okay\n\n\nSo here we have uh s matrix is given you want to transform it to\nthe t matrix quite simple your t matrix is just simply given by one over s21\nit's all over there\n\n\nRight any questions\n\n\nAny questions\n\n\nBy the way this tutorial session is being recorded and if it turns\nout that engineering class students do not ask questions it's going to\nreflect badly okay\n\n\nSo any questions\n\n\nCome on she's taking a survey of all the faculties and uh the\nresult will just confirm what everybody knows engineer students okay no\n\n\nNow let's move on\n\n<$G> \n\nSir the the part three application\n\n<$A> \n\nApplication\n\n<$G> \n\nApplication ya\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay <unclear> word </unclear> part three let's go part three\nthere\n\n\nRight now let's have a look at this particular matrix here uh this\nparticular statement here\n\n\nThis one here is a input A1 B1 is an input A2 B2 is output okay\n\n\nThe relationship between them is a simple t\n\n\nNow what if I have a whole string of boxes let's just draw more\nboxes\n\n\nOkay now this one let's say I have a t1 matrix this one has a t2\nmatrix\n\n\nRight the input here is related to this output via a t1 matrix but\nthis output cannot be an input to the second system okay\n\n\nSo this one will be related to another output A3 B3 via a t2 okay\n\n\nSo the application of this is if I have a loads cascade of\nnetworks I find that this is a very powerful way of handling things\n\n\nRight if there is a total of said n such boxes then all I need to\ndo is take the product of all n of them and I can straightaway get hold of my\ninput for whatever output regardless of the number of stages I need to\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nOkay and for filter design you know those that uh you sometimes\nneed a whole string of stages <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nFilter design not amplifier design okay\n\n<$H> \n\nSo in fact this uh is uh kind of a there's a correspondence\nto the ABC matrix in the\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause of ABC matrix because of ABC matrix <unclear> word\n</unclear> something like ABC matrix you <unclear> word </unclear> follow the\ntransmission matrix right\n\n\nI know <unclear> word </unclear> is what textbooks like to use but\nuh it's a very clumsy of calling <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nRight different matrices will have different features that is what\nis remember that for question our sub-question b okay so let's look at part b\n\n\nNow part b asks us to look at the system when it's reciprocal okay\n\n\nWhen does the system cease to be reciprocal\n\n\nCome on I've already taught I've already asked you all during\nlecture uh plus plus any others\n\n<$I> \n\nActive elements\n\n<$A> \n\nActive elements\n\n\nSome more\n\n<$J> \n\nByrex\n\n<$A> \n\nByrex okay\n\n\nMost the majority of the systems will be reciprocal the only\nexceptions are onyl plus plus byrex active elements okay\n\n\nIf you don't have these three the likelihood of it being\nreciprocal is very strong\n\n\nNow for the s matrix it's very easy to spot whether the system is\nreciprocal or not just look for the off diagonal elements okay\n\n\nIf the off diagonal elements are equal that's it the system is\nreciprocal T matrix however more work but t matrix you find that if you're to\ncheck whether your system is reciprocal you have to get hold of the\ndeterminant okay\n\n\nNow why\n\n\nWell here just go to the analysis to see why\n\n\nRight that is your determinant\n\n\nYou have all the elements already\n\n\nYou are off here so that's perfect then\n\n\nRight uh this okay\n\n\nRight this is your thing that's question correct uh things that we\ncancel out so it becomes easier\n\n\nThis one cancels with this so what we're left with is this\n\n\nIt's s21 here it's s21 squared here so we'll get rid of s21 uh\nwe're left with that okay\n\n\nNow we're told that the system is reciprocal which means that the\ns12 will be equal to s1 so that means this will be one okay so this is your\ncheck\n\n\nIf you have a s matrix it's simple just the check is just a visual\ncheck okay but if you're working on t matrix there's a little bit more work\nyou have to form the determinant\n\n\nSee if the determinant is one if it's given t then you can\nconclude that your system is reciprocal okay if it's not that means you have\none of those three elements in there byrex active elements or plus plus okay\n\n\nAny question No let's move on to question four\n\n\nThis question three sets the background and answers for it\n\n\nNow let's actually apply it to a circuit given in question four\n\n\nRight question four you have this system\n\n\nThe first matrix is sigma 'A'\n\n\nsorry second matrix is sigma\n\n\nWhat about sketching matrices\n\n\nWe're told that uh this your first cascade second cascade and then\nfinally you have to load okay\n\n\nThese are all boxes but your load could be in this box here could\nbe in the antenna right your antenna is radiating away\n\n\nThis one this box here could be uh a filter network you want to\nmake sure that only certain signals get sent all the other frequencies are\nfiltered out\n\n\nThis one here could be amplifier network okay\n\n\nYou want to make sure you pump enough signal uh pump enough power\nfor the antenna to radiate out right \n\n\nSo all these boxes are typical things that you need to put in for\nparticular system to work right Question is if here you have a load just put\nin the arrows if here you have a load such that your A just a minute A3 B3 if\nhere you have a load such that B3 <unclear> word </unclear> three <unclear>\nword </unclear> gamma L you'll be very interested to know what is my gamma in\nhere The gamma in is uh B1 over A1 okay A typical situation will be like this\nThis is your load you go through a series of cas uuh network over here you\nwant to hook it up to a source you want to check that your load is not going\nto heavily affect the source operation okay So this is a typical problem I\nwant to work out what gamma in is For gamma L after it has gone through a\nseries of boxes Right <unclear> word </unclear> in this case you find that uh\nyour transmission matrix is not powerful than your sketching matrix okay\nAlright uh your A1 B1 which you're interested in because that is where your\nsource is you want to know what is happening to it Let's say this can be\ntransformed to T' this can be transformed T'' you want to know what is\nhappening to <unclear> word </unclear> at the other port okay So that will\ngive you this this one can then be related to your other port okay So that is\nwhat we have Now let's give this a composite name this is a product here\nlet's give it a composite symbol of t So that means what I have is A1 is\nequals to t11 A3 plus t2 B3 B1 okay That's what I'm going to have The right\nhand side here there are two symbols two parameters A3 and B3 However we\nlearn that the load is somewhere else so the two of them are related in that\ncase B3 is just straightforwardly this okay So if I want gam gamma A simple\ntake this row divide by that row and straightaway I have the answer okay\nRight now that's your answer in terms of the composite matrix t However we\nstill got to get hold of T' and T'' okay So that's our next step get hold of\nT' and T'' Right t will be T' times uh T'' What is T' From question two uh\nsorry question three from question three we've already established that uh\nokay T' ought to be that T'' simple it's exactly the same uh except for a\nchange of symbols right Now you can take the product of it uh\nstraightforwardly by that but uh let's start making use of the approximations\nOkay return the product you find that you are uh you have quite a whole long\nof unwieldy string of uh terms but instead of doing that let's look at the\nsituation where skk here is small okay where sigma kk here is small", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nAlright so last year what when we talk about hazards and you\nknow there are two types of hazards right\n\n\nLatent dependency hazards which is what you try to take care of by\nyour data tagging internal body and the other type of hazards are job\nscheduling hazards and that's where we talk about collisions in the use of\nreservant table to prevent them\n\n\nJust one point the ladies brought up to my attention when we talk\nabout order table co-ording mechanisms to be very strict about it if you want\nto say that this after all the ording mechanism that you use produces an end\nstate that is identical to the original sequence of instructions then we\nreally need to have this as well\n\n\nIn another word or rather make he make it uh comes up like that\nalright to be strict about it\n\n\nOkay because the state of a system the state of a machine is\ndetermined by the contents of the internal registers alright at the end of\nthis original set of instructions when mister RO would contain the result of\nthat multiplication alright and that same result is <unclear> word </unclear>\ninto memory but it still contain in RO after that copy of registers alright\n\n\nFor that year at the end of it RO will also should also contain the\nresult of that multiplication alright\n\n\nSo that's latent depend dependency has okay then we started on job\nscheduling hazards and we define a <unclear> word </unclear> alright\n\n\nTo simplify matters we talk about a unifunction pipeline okay you\ncan do likewise or multifunction pipelines too but it's more complicated\n\n\nYou know initiation is just referring to the starting of a job in\nthe pipeline and the job scheduling hazard essentially refers to a collision\nwhen more than one job try to use a particular stage of the pipeline and we\nneed to use the reservation table to help us prevent collisions between jobs\nalright\n\n\nThe latency in time interval between successive initiations that\nmeans between successive jobs a latency sequence is just a sequence of just\nthe interval between jobs right\n\n\nAnd in if that sequence happen of intervals se uhm sequence repeats\nitself we call it a latency cycle okay alright\n\n\nAnd I showed you this example of a reservating table and we know\nthat if you try to start a second job one time unit later you will get a\ncollision right here at square two two right\n\n\nBecause job one is trying to use this stage job two is also trying\nto use the same stage okay job two is the blue mark job one is a red mark\nright\n\n\nSo we know we need to obtain a set of forbidden latencies that\nmeans those tine intervals that we cannot start new jobs alright\n\n\nOkay we start new jobs during those intervals at those intervals\nyou will lead to collisions okay\n\n\nAnd it turns out that forbidden latencies can be easily obtained\nfrom the reservation table by taking the distance between marks in any row\n\n\nFor this particular case the mark in the rows give us this set\nforbidden latencies alright\n\n\nOne five six and eight\n\n\nOkay you have marked it up one square apart here to there is five\nsquares apart from here to here is six squares apart alright\n\n\nAnd from that to that there are eight squares apart okay so those\nare the forbidden latencies okay if you start a job at an interval equal to\nthe spacing between any of those two marks then the utilisation of say stage\ntwo by the earlier job at the later time and by the later job at the earlier\ntime you will clash\n\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is this supposing okay here is one two three\nfour five so you start the first job and then you start the second job five\ntimes units later alright and at the time when the first job means stage two\nhere that corresponds to a time when the second job meets stage two at this\npoint alright because if you start your second job five times units later it\nmay clash right\n\n\nOkay this mark here corresponding to a second job is collision at\nthis point actually isn't it you know you know in its reservation table okay\n\n\nSo we know we can get the forbidden latencies right and to make\ncontrol of the pipeline easier all these collision uhm time intervals the\nforbidden latencies can be put into what is called a collision vector\n\n\nAnd a collision vector is simply is single bit positions alright\nwhere the bit position equal to a one bit position k equals to a one if k is\nan element of your forbidden set okay\n\n\nThat's a collision vector\n\n\nAll other bit position will be a zero\n\n\nSo for this specific example then what we are going to have for the\ncollision vector is position one two three four five six seven eight\n\n\nThat's the collision vector for this example alright\n\n\nPosition counting from right hand side starting at one okay\n\n\nSo bit k is a one in k itself is in your forbidden latency and we\nmake use of the shift register to decide when we can start a new job and you\nmake use of it this way\n\n\nWhen we start a job in the pipeline you would load this vector into\na shift register okay this collision vector goes into a shift register I mean\nstart the job alright\n\n\nAnd then we start shifting one bit at a time for each clock cycle\nif you shift a one out then if that at that instant you cannot start a new\njob alright if you shift a zero out then you can start a new job okay\n\n\nNow we said over here forbidden latencies are one five six eight\n\n\nSo your first after you have started a new job you loaded this in\nthe next clock cycle you will shift a one out\n\n\nThat way you cannot start at the next clock cycle alright\n\n\nSecond clock cycle later you're shifting the zero out you can start\na new job at the second clock cycle alright\n\n\nAnd that will not lead to a collision right because if you start\none clock cycle later you see that collision at square two two if you start\ntwo cycles later there's no problem okay\n\n\nNo clashes between the red and blue marks right\n\n\nSo load this into a shift register and if you shift a one out then\nyou cannot start a new job okay\n\n\nAt that time instance right\n\n\nEach cycle you shift one bit right\n\n\nOkay now think of how the state of the pipeline will proceed from\nhere\n\n\nRight we've started one job without this okay so we loaded this\ncollision vector one clock cycle later we shifted a one out we cannot start a\nnew job\n\n\nSecond clock cycle after that you're shifting a zero you know you\ncan start a new job fine and go ahead and start a new job alright\n\n\nIf you do that then the new job is going to fit in it's going to\nstart right here right\n\n\nTwo cycles later and the usage pattern will follow the same as the\nfirst one so it will go this way this way\n\n\nThat's the second job\n\n\nNow we need to know when can we start the third job okay\n\n\nWhen can we start the third job\n\n\nAnd so now we have job one and job two in the pipe\n\n\nJob one job two okay\n\n\nThis initial collision vector was used to prevent collision between\nthis alright\n\n\nSupposing after this case if you imagine you have another register\nokay we have more than one register for this collision vector\n\n\nAfter the new job we can load this same collision vector into the\nnew register and then we start shifting out from the second register to\ndecide when we start the third job right\n\n\nThe situation is exactly the same as between job two and job one\nright\n\n\nOkay between now we're talking about between job three and job two\nokay\n\n\nSo by looking at the second register checking for what is shifted\nout we can prevent collisions between job three and two but but that's not\nall that we have to worry about isn't it\n\n\nWe need to worry about clashes between job three and one as well\nalright\n\n\nIf you like we can think of it this way we started one job then one\ntime unit passes two time unit passes we started job two right\n\n\nSo job two is the one that this collision vector can protect from\ncolliding with job three okay\n\n\nSo looking at the second copy of this vector we can prevent\ncollisions between this third job now and the second job that means the blue\nand the green mark we can prevent clashes using this vector okay\n\n\nWe still need to take care of clashes between the third job and\nwhatever is left of the earlier jobs between job three and job one we still\nneed to take care of that between the blue mark and the red mark\n\n\nRight now we have not taken care of that yet alright\n\n\nSound complicated but we can just use one register to take care of\neverything okay because turns out that the convenient technique for handling\nall of these is to fine we know this which is this same collision vector will\nprotect us from collision between this and this okay\n\n\nNow we've started job two two time units later so we've shifted\nthis out and we've shifted that one out\n\n\nSo what is left for the first job is this pattern alright\n\n\nWe need to OR them OR this one to this pattern okay\n\n\nSo we'll OR this and we'll end up with this\n\n\nThis becomes the new collision vector and it will protect you\nagainst all collisions alright between your new job and all the previous jobs\nokay\n\n\nBecause this one prevents collision between three and two that one\nwhich is shifted from there prevents collision between the new job and the\nearlier jobs alright\n\n\nSo this becomes the new collision vector for the whole pipeline for\nthe whole system alright\n\n\nAnd you can proceed to do this for every single interval where you\ncan start new jobs okay\n\n\nWe say that this this collision vector represents the state of the\npipeline alright and therefore we can obtain what is called a state diagram\nfor the entire pipeline right that tells you exactly at any point in time\nwhen you can start another job okay no matter how many other jobs are still\nin the pipe\n\n\nSo we need to get the state diagram alright\n\n\nDon't this any more so the initial collision vector is this one two\nthree four five six seven eight\n\n\nI do the working on another sheet alright then this one will give\nthe proper state diagram\n\n\nWe cannot start one time unit later we can start a new job two time\nunits later\n\n\nSo what is left from here is after two time units later you'll have\nzero zero one one zero one alright\n\n\nThat is what is left from the earlier job\n\n\nFor the new job for the second job which is started two time units\nlater we we get this same pattern we OR them we end up with this\n\n\nSo this becomes the new state of the pipeline alright\n\n\nSo we say this is initial alright your first one that comes in and\nthen two time units later we started a new job the new state of the <unclear>\nword </unclear> of the system becomes characterised by this collision vector\nalright\n\n\nWe can also start a job three time units later right after the\nfirst job okay so that will give us a different table\n\n\nOkay so that one will give us if you started three time units\ninstead this is what is left again we have to OR it \n\n\nOkay what is called the initial collision vector you get another\nnew state okay So this one characterises this system if we started the second\njob three time units later instead of two So we have this after three time\nunits right And you can proceed on okay second third fourth time interval\nthen we end up with right you again you OR them okay to give you the new\nstate You proceed on like that you will end up with this one four units later\nalright So two three four five six you can start around seven units later If\nyou start one seven units later and you OR them you find that you get back\nthis thing itself okay So seven units later you'd get back itself alright\nbecause after seven units all you have is a one in the least significant\nposition okay so initial vector all with a one there give you exactly the\nsame thing alright After seven you cannot start one eight units later you can\nstart after nine units ten units eleven units and so on right Okay So this\nalso applies for nine and above right after the first clock So right now all\nwe've taken care of is all possibilities after having started one job alright\nThen we go to each of the other and do the same thing okay to find out what\nother new states So having done all cases with this we come to this So\nsupposing it has first job two time units later it started second job when\ncan we do the third job Okay you can't do it one time unit later because you\nshift a one out you can do it two units later because they're shifting a zero\nout Then you do the same thing right So in that case if you do that you're\ngoing to After two units from this state with their two jobs in the system\nthen you start your third job alright We get this okay so that's the new\nstate here where you start another job two units after this state alright\nAgain you can go two three four five six you can start one seven units later\nThat will bring you back to this state right So after seven units again\nyou're just left with one at the end okay You OR that you have the initial\ncollision vector you get back the same thing okay Again you cannot start\nafter eight you can start after nine and above nine and above there's nothing\nleft all you have will be just this So again you have this and nine and above\nalright So you just proceed the same way for each state that you have not\ntaken care of to fill up to complete this state diagram okay this is called a\nstate diagram So let me just finish this up and one two three four units\nlater you can start one more job right from this state We've taken care of\nthis we've taken care of that Okay so four units later and you OR the results\nyou're going to end up with this okay So after you you've done this OR\noperation and get the new collision vector you have to check that whatever\nyou have so far to see whether this new vector is in there or not okay\nwhether you need to introduce it as a new state or it's a matter of going\nback to one of the existing states okay Don't repeat the state you're going\nto confuse yourself alright", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM",

{"text": "<$A> \n\nNow I'll fill you on with uhm the addition reactions\n\n\nWell you addition reactions are not typical reactions of aromatic\ncompounds that or you have seen so uhm addition reactions are not the typical\nreactions of aromatic compounds\n\n\nUh but of the three five methods hetrocyclic compounds furan uhm\nthiophen and pyrrole I have pointed out to you that furan is of the lowest uh\naromaticity it's the least aromatic of the three\n\n\nSo you find that there are efficient reactions taking place in furan\nalright and this is because of its low aromatic character and uhm and\nindicates that furan tends to behave like a diene alright that's when it's\nnot behaving like an aromatic compound alright\n\n\nThis is furan uhm both of their electrons are opposed donated they\nare donated to the ring system in order that the compound possess six pie\nelectrons alright required by aromatic sets <unclear> word </unclear> you\nnote that if you mix these whole <unclear> word </unclear> the subsequent\nkenonical structures would have a positive charge on oxygen right which is\nnot favourable for furan\n\n\nSo because of that furan would rather not have alright the charge\noxygen right it would tend to remain in its neutral form alright and in this\nway it will behave like a diene alright\n\n\nThis is the diene component\n\n\nNow there are many examples of furan behaving as a diene chemically\nuhm these are some of them\n\n\nCan you see\n\n\nIs it too light is it\n\n\nCan you see from behind\n\n\nYou can't ah\n\n\nWould it help if I turn off the light right\n\n<$B> \n\nRight\n\n<$A> \n\nSo we have first of all the nitration of furan the nitration\nof furan uhm nitration is carried out using what is this reagent uhm Ee Lee\n\n\nIt's the usual nitrating reagent for the hetrocyclic compound Chek\nYu\n\n\nAhum Tin Wee\n\n\nThis is the\n\n<$C> \n\nNitronium acetate\n\n<$A> \n\nNitronium acetate acetile nitrate alright quite close alright\n\n\nAcetile nitrate and it is uhm nitrating agent for all these five\nhetrocycles because for what reason\n\n\nMing Seng\n\n\nBecause it is weakly acidic alright you cannot afford to use uhm\nnitric acid <unclear> word </unclear> nitric acid and sulphuric acid for the\nnitration reactions so acetile nitrate is used because of its low acidity\n\n\nRight so what do we have\n\n\nUhm now you find that for furan reaction with acetyl nitrate does\nnot give them nitrofuran as expected\n\n\nInstead the product of reaction is a two five adduct right having\nthe structure\n\n\nSo you see this is the nitronium ion that was originally added on\nalright and you find that there is a acetyl <unclear> word </unclear> that is\nattached onto the other terminal carbon which came from the acetate and ion\nalright there is a two five adduct that is formed\n\n\nThis two five adduct is not very stable and on uh treatment and on\nheating or pyridine treatment with pyridine the acetyl <unclear> word\n</unclear> is lost as acidic acid and this will regenerate nitrofuran right\nwhich is the product that one expects first\n\n\nNow why is it that the reaction follows this rather odd course\nobserved here\n\n\nNow the mechanism of the reaction is shown\n\n\nWell initially there would be an addition of the nitronium ion\nright like in the in this manner uh something that you are familiar with\n\n\nThe charge alright would be delocalised\n\n\nThe positive charge would be delocalised on this carbon this carbon\nand then on the oxygen which we know is of lowest stability because of the\ncharge of oxygen\n\n\nNow remember that when the nitronium ion goes and attack the carbon\nthere is still the acetate that remains behind and the acetate and ion can\nact as a nucleophile alright so it will attack the positive centre on the\ncarbon on a nucleus\n\n\nWell this may not be sterically favourable alright this position\nmay not be sterically favourable this one further away from the nitro would\nbe more suitable and this is what happens\n\n\nThe acetate then goes in into this position and you have your\nadduct formed alright in this way right\n\n\nSo we have the nitronium ion and uhm this way\n\n\nIn another words there are two alternative pathways which this\nnitronium which this cat-ion can go\n\n\nThe first would be the usual elimination of H plus This will give\nyou the substitution product alright uh the cost of react for thiophen and\npyrrole this is the normal course of reaction alright the normal course but\nyou find that there's an alternative process which is reaction with C-H-2 the\nnucleophile\n\n\nSo the H does not get lost right this is the alternative\nalternative pathway\n\n\nNow which of these paths or rather the choice of uhm which pathway\nwould be followed is dependent upon the activation energies of each step\ndepends on the relative activation energies of each step alright for this it\nwould be the activation energy for the loss of proton alright and for this it\nwould be the activation energy for the reaction with acetate\n\n\nNow if the compound the resulting compound has got good aromatic\ncharacter in it the activation energy for the protonation would also be low\nalright would be low\n\n\nIf there is aromatic character well developed in the final product\nthen the activation energy for loss of proton would be small alright\n\n\nBut in the case of furan since aromatic character is poorly\ndeveloped this is of low aromaticity\n\n\nThe deprotonation energy would be higher than as compared to the\ndeprotonation energy for the corresponding thiophen or pyrrole derivative\nalright\n\n\nSo this pathway becomes an attractive alternative alright so that\nbecause of it the reaction is directed along this course rather than above\n\n\nBut for the rest you find that if this is S alright or if it is N-H\nalright thiophen or pyrrole actually these two alternatives also exist that\nmeans it can go like that or by this way\n\n\nBut you find that this pathway hardly takes place at all because\nthe activation energy for loss of proton is very small and why is it small\n\n\nIt's because aromatic character is well developed in the final\nproduct alright so it never even looks at this pathway it is directed along\nthis direction in this direction\n\n\nSo because of this ah for furan you do not have a straightforward\nsubstitution alright of H like N-O-2 but there is an addition by the acetate\nand ion to give rise to the two five adduct alright which is not stable so\nyou do get back the product that uh one sets out to obtain the two nitrofuran\nby treatment of heat alright or uh by heat treatment or treatment with\npyridine alright that will eliminate the acetate and give rise to the product\nokay\n\n\nRight so that's for the nitration of furan\n\n\nNow there could be other reagents used in place of acetyl nitrate\nuh reagents which contain a nitronium cat-ion and which are also weakly\nacidic\n\n\nOne example is nitronium etrafluoroborate this alright nitronium\ntetrafluoroborate\n\n\nNow when nitration is carried out using this particular reagent\nthere is no adduct formed\n\n\nThat means that it gives rise to a straightforward addition\n\n\nYou get this immediately alright and you may wonder what happen to\nthe BF4 minus why is it it doesn't add on to the positive centre to the ring\n\n\nThe reason is that the BF4 minus is not a nucleophille alright it\nis not a nucleophile\n\n\nIf you look at it carefully you will see that its valence is\nalready saturated alright\n\n\nThe boron atom cannot form an additional bond so it cannot it will\nnot react with the current the positively charged carbon because its valence\nis already satisfied is completely satisfied alright\n\n\nSo you find that when uh nitration is carried out using nitronium\ntetrafluoroborate you won't have this form alright you'll have the addition\nof the ni the nitronium cat-ion and then this will not take place\n\n\nThe elimination of H will then occur and the nitrofuran is obtained\nalright\n\n\nSo that is uh so must watch out you must watch out for the type of\nreagent that is used alright for the reaction\n\n\nNow another example of an addition reaction of furan is the\nbromination is uh the bromination reaction\n\n\nNow bromination uhm is usually not a very useful electrophilic\nsubstitution reaction because it tends to give rise to polyhalogenated\ncompounds right\n\n\nThe halogen enters at more than uh one position so it's uh unless\nyou are looking for a multi-substituted product\n\n\nBut if you want to have a monosubstituted product uhm in order for\nthe reaction to be useful it must be conducted at low temperatures right low\ntemperatures\n\n\nNow this is an example the bromination of furan there's a bromonium\nelectrophile the bromonium cat-ion which is the electrophile the reaction is\ncarried out in the solvent methadol and at minus ten degrees centigrade\n\n\nNow not uhm the products formed well not a-s a single product is\nnot formed from this reaction alright you find that there are three products\nproduced\n\n\nThis is the expected product of electrophilic substitution alright\n\n\nNow how did this come about\n\n\nBy the following mechanism the same as the above alright there is a\ndis delocalisation of the positive charge\n\n\nThere's methocide and ion which is the nucleophile comes from the\nsolvent methanol alright\n\n\nSo the methadol will produce the methocide and ion which will act\nas a nucleophile and attack the ring alright\n\n\nSo you'll find that that is how the first product is uh formed and\nthe second the third product that is shown uh it is produced by the\ndisplacement of B-R minus by C-H-3-O minus by the methocide and ion alright\nloss of P-R minus\n\n\nThe halogens are good leaving groups so it is displaced and then\nyou have it alright a diene methocine adduct alright\n\n\nSo you find that uhm the hydrogen atoms here are quite resistant\nalright to displacement because they are not so uh they are not as good leave\nthey are not <unclear> word </unclear> leaving groups as compared to bromine\nalright\n\n\nSo uh these products are imitative of an addition reaction taking\nplace in furan right\n\n\nNow the last example of an addition reaction is that of a\ncycloaddition process and the name of this reaction is called is the\nDielsAlder Reaction\n\n\nNow the Diels-Alder Reaction refers to addition reactions of dienes\nalright\n\n\nYou have a diene here\n\n\nNow dienes will react with certain reagents uhm which are called\ndienophile\n\n\nActually the name is not very doesn't convey to you very much\ninformation because the dienophile is just a compound that likes a diene\nalright dienophile alright like hydrophilic right that uh P-H-I-L-E indicates\nit likes a diene\n\n\nSo uhm a number various types of reagents can uhm act in this\ncapacity as dienophile\n\n\nA common example a good example is maleic anhydride alright\n\n\nSo when you have diene and maleic anhydride addition takes place to\ngive rise to an adduct the product is just called an adduct or a Diels-Alder\nAl a Diels-Alder adduct alright\n\n\nNow if you look at it carefully you will see that this portion\nrepresents the original diene right\n\n\nThis portion is the original diene\n\n\nAddition has taking has taken place evolving the double bond right\n\n\nThe double bond of maleic anhydride has disappeared alright so you\nfind these are the new bonds that are created alright\n\n\nSince addition occurs the two double bonds of diene cannot no long\ncan no longer exist\n\n\nIt is now reduced to one and this is the remaining double bond\nalright\n\n\nSo can you see this is the original diene and this is maleic\nanhydride component alright with the double bond uhm saturated\n\n\nNow furan has been noted to act like a diene it can react with\nmaleic anhydride so you find that the same thing addition across the double\nbond of uh maleic anhydride produces an adduct\n\n\nNow there are two confirmations of this adduct one an exo and the\nother one endo alright \n\n\nExo is when the well the furan ring or what remains of it is\norientated at a different plane from the maleic anhydride alright So these\ndash lines indicates that it's going down below the plane and the bold lines\nit is above the plane so that is endo alright The endo product is formed more\nrapidly It is a kinetic but it is not the most stable Subsequent\nrearrangement will take place to give rise to the exo adduct Note the\norientation of these two wings alright Now at the same direction this one is\nthe thermodynamic product alright So this is an example Have you do you\nremember examples of uh reactions under thermodynamic and kinetic control Uuh\none that I mention some time ago the sulfunation of kuinonine alright You\nfind that that is also under kinetic and thermodynamic control alright So uhm\nthe cycloaddition alright which is an indication that furan has diene-like\ncharacter alright Uh another thing that one could also add to the list of uhm\nproperties you know like uh furan indicating its diene-like properties It's\nthe electrophilic substitution of furan uh in particular the orientation of\nthe incoming electrophile alright Do you remember that part of it Alright you\nhad furan alright and you find that you have a substituent and I mention that\nuh for all the other hetrocycles where the electrophile enters will depend on\nwhat this X is whether it's electron donating or electron withdrawing right\nDoes that do you remember that But you find that in the case of furan it\ndoesn't matter what X is the two X alright at the two position it can be\nelectron donating or electron withdrawing but the electrophile is always\ndirected to the other kerminal carbon alright position five Alright and the\nreason why this is uh so well it is a reflection of its diene-like character\nalright I talk about the stabilisation of the carbonium ions and so forth\nalright Supposing it goes here you find that there is limited stabilisation\nof the charge of the positive charge If it goes into this direction you find\nthat it's more the localisation of charge alright So uh this is one point to\ntake note of right can add can be added to the list alright of uhm uh\nchemical evidence of the low aromatic character of furan Right now so having\ndone with uh electrophilic substitution reactions and addition reactions we\nwill now move on to nucleophilic reactions", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "54effd59-20bd-49fa-826e-e1e45c923d3f",

instructor code 2180 64\n\n\n\nNow we are going to do letters of credit today but before we move on\nto that I want to just uhm summarise some points about the mortgages like our\ntutorial we had\n\n\n\nThis is to uh enable some of you who were not quite finished the\nlast time to <unclear> word </unclear> take note and then we can go on to\nletters of credit so this part won't be too much of a discussion hope you\ndon't mind about that\n\n\n\nThe mortgages tutorial question three was essentially a tutorial on\nland titles mortgages\n\n\n\nOkay and before I go on to that actually there's a point on question\ntwo which I want to uh mention which I missed the last time and this is in\nrelation to two b where the mortgage jobs lease have been terminated by his\nlessor\n\n\n\nOkay we mention that his primary remedy would be a covenant I mean a\nsuit upon the personal covenant\n\n\n\nUh under section eighteen of the CLPA there is also provision for\nthe mortgagee to go to court and apply for what is called a relief okay from\nfrom a relief\n\n\n\nIn uh in other words asking the court to say look I've got interests\nthis guy can move in but surely he's got to think about me\n\n\n\nCould you ask him to give me some money at least you know that sort\nof thing\n\n\n\nSo an application for relief Section eighteen CLPA\n\n\n\nOkay so now question three the same sets of facts but uhm two a\nwhich say that as far as that is concerned uhm the PLA has got uh provision\nfor entry possession\n\n\n\nThe difference between LPA entry and CLPA entry is that under the\nLPA the mortgagee has got to give notice the one month notice before he moves\nin and his notice is given only if there is default\n\n\n\nOkay if you remember under Common Law the mortgagee's right to\nenter is at any time even before the ink is dry on the deed\n\n\n\nBut in this case in the LTA your entry must be upon default\n\n\n\nSince there is default here that point is academic\n\n\n\nThat's three a Three b I mention that uh once you look at the\nregister the register is everything so if you see a mortgage there the lessor\nwould have to take subject to the mortgagee's interest\n\n\n\nThat's quite obvious because everything is on the register he would\nhave noticed even if he didn't read it actually he's got constructive notice\nthat there is a prior party so that he when he forfeits the lease of the\nlessee he takes that land back for himself that is he must take it subject to\nthe mortgagee's interest okay\n\n\n\nAnd we've got that as a basic principle and it's supported of\ncourse by the LTA\n\n\n\nThe LTA has got section sixty-two which says that when the lessor\nand the lessee's interests are merged in this case it has become uh merged in\none person's name\n\n\n\nThen what happen is that lessor that person who took the merged\ninterest would have to pay off the mortgagee section sixty-two LTA and\nfurthermore we find that there is a section fifty-nine sub-section\nsub-section one of the LTA again which states that a transferee \nexcuse me a transferee must uhm either pay off the mortgagee that means\ndischarge him or perform the obligations of the mortgage\n\n\n\nSo in this case section fifty-nine one is also useful for the\nmortgaging so you find that for under the LTA the mortgager's position is\nmuch happier is not so long of course as he's registered okay regis the regis\nthe register is everything therefore the mortgagee must register\n\n\n\nMost cases you find they do\n\n\n\nOnce it's registered his rights are there in the LTA section\nfifty-nine one question sixty-two okay\n\n\n\nThree b Three c is an oral contract which means it's an equitable\nmortgage\n\n\n\nUnder the LTA you can have equitable mortgages\n\n\n\nIt is recognised implicitly in section thirty-seven two which says\nthat once you have contractual rights the LTA does not invalidate those\ncontractual rights\n\n\n\nIt is also expressly accepted in a case decided by our former Chief\nJustice\n\n\n\nThe case called Bank of China uh Bank of China versus official\nassignee nineteen eighty three case Bank of China's case\n\n\n\nNow we know generally that the remedies of the LTA mortgagee are\nthe same as he has been Common Law the section sixty-four LTA says so\n\n\n\nSection LT four uh section sixty-four basically says that the CLPA\nand all your Common Law rights apply mutatis mutandis\n\n\n\nOkay I explain because it's got something it's got nothing to do\nwith the ninja turtles but nonetheless the root word is the same mutations so\nuh mu mutatis mutandis section sixty-four says that the CLPA applies with\nappropriate changes in other words okay\n\n\n\nThe appropriate changes meaning for example when the CLPA talks\nabout say a free-hold owner you just change it to registered proprietor\nterminology of the LTA\n\n\n\nUh when the CLPA says you've got a right for closure you look at\nthe LTA you find that the uh those rights mentioned in CLPA are slightly\nmodified in section seventy seven zero of the LTA okay so mutatis mutandis\n\n\n\nSo in this case then if the LTA recogises an equitable mortgage\nthen obviously what you have in common law the equitable mortgagee's rights\nthose are more or less similar in the LTA's system\n\n\n\nThree d there is no mention anywhere at the and the LTA that the\nrules about fixtures have been abolished so you can say that in this sense\nthe LTA is silent about fixtures therefore Common Law applies\n\n\n\nYou could also actually look at section four definition of land\nsection four LTA defines land to include uhm structures affixed thereon for\nexample and I think you could read that to mean that the law of fixtures mean\nthe same okay\n\n\n\nThat's three d and therefore the answer should be the same as in\ntwo d\n\n\n\nThree e when we talk about relevant <unclear> word </unclear> of\ncourse we're talking about the LTA\n\n\n\nThe mortgage has not been registered under the LTA which means it\nis not valid\n\n\n\nIt is not recognised by the LTA as a legal mortgage since it's not\nregistered and since the register is everything\n\n\n\nThis is not a valid legal legal mortgage\n\n\n\nNonetheless the LTA does recognise an equitable mortgage as we said\nearlier that equitable mortgage cannot be registered but you can lodge a\ncaveat in respect of that interest\n\n\n\nThe purpose of lodging a caveat is basically to warn okay caveat\nmeans warning to warn the whole world at large that okay I don't have a\nregistered interest but you better transact with my interest in mind\n\n\n\nI am an equitable mortgagee I may not have very strong rights but\nyou must remember me when you talk to the registered proprietor so this is\ndifferent from the RODA RODA basically as I said earlier on registration does\nnot affect validity\n\n\n\nIf you're already valid under the Common Law you remain valid even\nif you don't register\n\n\n\nIf you originally were invalid registration does not make you valid\nso the RODA does not affect validity but if you were a valid legal mortgage\nand you are number one in the queue you do want to continue being number one\nand in this case therefore you want to register because if you don't register\nyou're going you're going to lose out\n\n\n\nYou're going to lose your place in the queue and there's no point\nsaying I've got a legal mortgage it is valid therefore I have a power of sale\nbut you're number ten\n\n\n\nBy the time you come to exercise the power of sale there's nothing\nto sell right\n\n\n\nSo you want to be first in line you register\n\n<$B> \n\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> being a legal mortgage ah doesn't it\nrank you ahead of the rest already\n\n<$A> \n\n\nYes no because if you don't register you don't have priorities\nso the fact that you are legal mortgage doesn't matter now because the RODA\nchanges your rights of priority section four basically and section fourteen\nof the RODA okay\n\n\n\nSection section four says you must register section fourteen says\nonce you register you are preserving your priority\n\n\n\nConsequently if you don't register you don't preserve your priority\n\n<$B> \n\n\nSir then when will it go when the equi the legal mor mortgage\nwas prevailed\n\n<$A> \n\n\nWhen okay that was all the all the rules about legal over\nequitable and all that apply when there is no statutory amendment\n\n\n\nSo for fixed charges and closing charges when they talk about\nranking of course the legal prevails and the fixed prevails\n\n\n\nAgain they you talk about priority in other areas of property law\nwhich hasn't been changed the statute\n\n\n\nThe ranking is there\n\n\n\nIt's it's a general framework of law\n\n\n\nThe ranking is given by Common Law but Common Common Law can be\nprevailed can be overruled by statute and in land it has been overruled by\nthe RODA and by the LTA okay\n\n\n\nSo remember those rules I taught you earlier as a sort of\nbackground or a base on which now you are building new knowledge and that's\nthe RODA and the LTA okay\n\n\n\nRight now in this case registration uh non registration rather non\nregistration would make the mortgage invalid unless it can be construed as an\nequitable mortgage in which case it's got the right of an equitable mortgagee\nI mean the the the mortgagee will have the right to the equitable mortgagee\nand that's another different story\n\n\n\nThe whole idea of the LTA is that once you've got registered land\nyou don't have to look anywhere to search for title to search for who is the\nowner who has got a charge who's got a mortgage who's got a pledge whatever\neverything is on the register and that simple statement every the register is\neverything comes from Privy Council case actually and you could remember that\nas a quotable quote the register is everything\n\n\n\nException of course is actual fraud\n\n\n\nWhen you have actual fraud then the person who's been defrauded can\ngo to court and upset or erase the registration so to speak okay rectify the\nregister okay\n\n\n\nThat's two e and therefore two f is basically the same answer\n\n\n\nThe unregistered mortgage it doesn't matter whether you are legal\nor equitable in this case once you're unregistered you do not have priority\n\n\n\nOf course the registered legal mortgage will take priority\n\n\n\nOne small little refinement to this point if the unregistered\nmortgage is an equitable mortgage you can't you can't register it at all\nunder LTA and since you can't register it there is no fight because here\nwe've got a interest that is unregisterable versus an interest which is\nregisterable and between these two then the the ah equitable mortgagee must\nlodge a caveat to preserve his priority\n\n\n\nIf he doesn't lodge a caveat I would think he remains outside the\nregister and therefore he has no right at all\n\n\n\nNow in this case you would want to note the difference between the\nRODA system and the LTA\n\n\n\nRemember I said that under the RODA whether you are equitable or\nyou're legal you are both registerable\n\n\n\nYou are both registered registerable under the RODA and therefore\nyou've you have competing interests if one doesn't register\n\n\n\nIn the LTA system only legal mortgages can be registered and the\nequitable mortgage if you want to preserve your prio priority you have to\ncaveat your interest okay\n\n\n\nAnd that sums up everything you need to know about LTA\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n<$B> \n\n\nSir when you lodge a caveat right does he rank uh ahead of the\nlegal mortgage \n\n<$A> \n\n\nWell the caveat is a sort of notice to the world\n\n\n\nRe remember if you remember your fixed charge lectures your first\ncharge is a floating charge\n\n\n\nA second charge comes along and it's a fixed charge Now the fixed\ncharge prevails over the floating charge you jump the queue if you're a fixed\ncharge but if you are a fixed charge with notice of a negative pledge cross\nup here then you take with notice and therefore you take subject to that\nfloating charge interest right Same thing here you've got an equitable\nmortgage caveated notice to all subsequent people that I've got an equitable\nmortgage then a legal legal mortgage comes along it's registered but it's\nregistered subject to that interest because there is notice either actual or\nconstructive okay Right Further questions Okay no further questions we move\non to our letters of credit and firts question you are now employed by this\nbank very progressive bank It wants to entertain the customers' wish If you\ncan solve the problems that the requests ah raise So now we want to discuss\nthese problems and see whether it can accede to the customers' requests Okay\nso Mr Big your customer first request electronic communication facilities for\ncredit Can you accede to that request Would you Are there any problems Mr Big\njust wants communication facilites to apply for credits to notify his\nbeneficiary to notify himself that his credit has been opened basically that\nCan you do it Yes No Yes or no S2: Yes\n\n<$A> \n\n\nYes Who says no Anyone thinks you won't request uh you won't\naccede to the request So you think yes All of you think yes Are there no\nproblems then What problems do you think there might be in this case Any\nproblem Okay the technical problems we're not going to discuss them here but\nanyway this is not a problem because technology exists to allow the customer\nto communicate with this bank by electronic communications right So it exists\nThe modem is quite cheap the telephone is quite cheap your fax machine all\nthese things are on fact quite common So it's not the question of technology\nIs there a legal problem Is there a legal problem here What sort what sort of\nproblem do you have here if you think there is a problem Anyone", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL",

{"text": "<$A> \n\nOkay now in the previous many lectures and we concern ourselves with the the \nmovement of solute in a single phase only\n\n\nWe say how would the solute be transported from the bulk solution or\nbulk <unclear> word </unclear> to the interface or to the place where it ends\n\n\nWe never said anything about what happen after that so we only\nconcentrate ourselves with one single phase but mass transfer processes\nalways involve some you know significant changes to the solute that you have\nso actually we have normally in in chemical <unclear> word </unclear> system\nmultiphases and we can only consider a cup a two phases at a time how the\nsolute move from one place to the other\n\n\nNow for each phase involved there is what we have assumed the film\ntheory and this film theory imply that the transport of molecule from the\nbulk into the uh to the interface or to the place where the two phases\nseparate and we assume by the film theory that the major draught\nconcentration draught or the major change in the concentration within the\nphase is confined to a single film and that's why we call it the film theory\nright\n\n\nAnd uh we relate this to our diffusivility and from there we relate\nto what we call a term call mass transfer coefficient\n\n\nNow today we are going to continue with this and say how when this\nsolute is then is brought to the interface separating the two phases what\nhappen after that\n\n\nWill the solute go into the second phase and if it goes into a\nsecond phase what happen\n\n\nThat's one thing second thing is what happen at the interface okay\n\n\nNow for this interface mass transfer it relates to as I said to many\nmany different chemical engineering processes\n\n\nLet's take for example the gas liquid system now here we are\nconcerned with a particular solute in this gas and in the liquid mixture\n\n\nNow we have a gas containing a solute which we want to remove using\na solution in other words we want to the solute from the gas to go into the\nsolution\n\n\nWe have what we call absorption A-P okay A-B\n\n\nNow here the ab and ad are two different thing and this actually is\nis subscripts of not subscript what the word called pre prefix of a English\nword stemmed from Latin roots uh\n\n\nAb means by ad means two so here ab absorption is the solute from\nthe gas is absorbed by the liquid by the liquid whereas in the third case\nwhere liquid-solid we have adsorption gas-solid too I forgot to put the one\n\n\nI should not put the liquid there I should put a uh fluid fluid\nsolid system will be an adsorption\n\n\nAdsorption means the solute is being taken onto the surface of the\nsolids okay\n\n\nNow this gas liquid if we have a liquid and we boil it up or even\nnot boiling we if the uh if the gas phase that is in contact with the content\nless solute at equilibrium with the liquid then the solute in the liquid will\nthen come out we transfer from the bulk uh liquid into the to the interphase\nand from interphase out into the gas phase\n\n\nNow liquid liquid liquid liquid here we if we have to have a\ninterface we must have immissible liquid in other words the liquid cannot mix\neach other so they become two phases and they are both in liquid state\n\n\nNow here we have what we call in motion invisible liquid solid a\nmovement\n\n\nNow here we have relate to our processes call the extractive\nprocesses solvent extraction which I think I don't think you have done any\nexperiment in that that will be in third year so solvent extraction\n\n\nSo liquid solid we have absorption dissolution in other word the\nsolid the solute in the solid will then dissolve in a liquid okay\n\n\nNow very important concept here is mass transfer will only occur if\nthat is a departure from equilibrium whether it is in a singlephase or\ncross-phases okay\n\n\nNow in a gas phase or in a vapour phase we can describe our\ncomposition in terms of Y-A which is the the uh ratio of the partial pressure\nof A divided by the total pressure that is given by Dalton Dalton's Law and\nhe says summation of this partial pressure is equal to total pressure that's\nwhat we can find the composition in that way and this will be molar\ncomposition\n\n\nAnd Dalton Russ which Rasult says that it is a simple relationship\nto the solute concentration in the other <unclear> word </unclear> in a\nliquid phase\n\n\nSo in P-A partial pressure is equal to Y-A-P over X-A\n\n\nNow this is ideal system\n\n\nNow non-ideal system of course we have I think in term of dynamics\nyou already study about this activities\n\n\nYou cannot use X-A you must use activities and activities of course\nrelated to the activity coefficient and so on\n\n\nNow Henry's Law Henry's Law is strictly is a very special case is\nstrictly apply to only dilute solution or to solution which contains very\nsparingly soluble solute so so that the partial pressure is directly\nproportional to the concentration of the solute\n\n\nNow this the second two relationship with Dalton Raoult's and\nHenry's Law describes the equilibrium relationship between the solute in a\nliquid and a solid in a gas phase okay\n\n\nNow this is for the gas liquid\n\n\nNow for the liquid liquid I just put the example for the gas liquid\nhere for the liquid liquid same thing happens except that X-A and Y-A are now\nreferring to the two liquid phases okay and this is what we call liquid\nliquid equilibrium relationship but they are not governed by the same law\n\n\nNow the solid liquid the solid fluid now you have heard about\nadsorption you have heard about adsorption isotherm\n\n\nThe adsorption isotherm is a equilibrium relating the solute in a\nfluid and a solute absorbed onto the solid okay so that is the Demure\n\n\nYou have done that haven't you in your thermodynamics\n\n\nNo\n\n\nDemure fixed law\n\n\nSo those are the fluid solid equilibrium\n\n\nDon't be so stern\n\n\nDon't worry about <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nNow that part when you translate you have to remove this\n\n\nThey look they look so tense normally they are not like that your\ninfluence\n\n\nNormally they were laughing and smiling okay anyway\n\n\nSo now we've come back to this the relationship now you must have\nwonder why did I talk about equilibrium\n\n\nNow if you have a transfer from one place to another definitely\nthere must be some relationship between the two phases and since you have a\ninterface that equilibrium relationship most probably I say first most\nprobably occur at the interface\n\n\nNow through research and all it has establish that no matter what\nhappen at interface at interface the composition of one phase is invariably\nin equilibrium with the second phase at the interface\n\n\nNow there's some work long time ago regarding this phenomena and\nthere's one research worker claim that there's certain departure\n\n\nHe call it the kinetic molecular departure but then the departure\nis so small that for all purpose and intention we say that it is at\nequilibrium and this make life very easy for design engineers okay\n\n\nNow with that let's look at the composition diagram for the\ndifferent model\n\n\nNow we join the liquid the the film theory for one single phase and\nsince now we have two phases\n\n\nWe have two film so we call this as two film model and this is\nfirst proposed by Lewis and Whitman\n\n\nEach film is describe by the film theory regarding the transport of\nthe solute from the bulk to the interface\n\n\nThis is the <unclear> word </unclear> separating the two phases and\nthe other one the phase two is sort of described by similar ways and this is\nour concentration profile\n\n\nNow here we find that the diagram there depicts the movement of A\nfrom the gas phase to the liquid phase and C-A-I P-A-I are the composition\nrelating to the two phases at the interface and <unclear> word </unclear>\nthat they are related through the equilibrium relationship no matter whether\nit's liquid liquid system solid fluid system or gas liquid system okay each\none has its own type of equilibrium relationship\n\n\nNow this conceptually P-A-I is not exactly sitting on the interface\nokay it's a little bit removed from interface it is the partial pressure of A\nat the interface just floating above the interface and the concentration\nC-A-I is just immediately in the liquid phase at the boundary condition at\nthe boundary itself and together they maintain that relationship\n\n\nSo the the uh rate of transfer from the bulk of the of phase one to\nthe interface is then described by this concentration jug within the film\nitself and it moves into the liquid phase after it has gone into the liquid\nphase or into the phase two\n\n\nNow if phase two is liquid A when get from the gas into the liquid\nphase has to become a liquid state <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nNow that becomes that join into the A in the liquid phase or in the\nphase two and then you move into the bulk solution\n\n\nNow if the gas phase and the liquid phase are in motion and in\nconstant motion and if P-A-G and C-A-L are constant in other word it is a\ndynamic system if they are constant then there will be a steady state whereby\nthe rate of movement in the gas phase will then be equal to the rate of\nmovement in the liquid phase\n\n\nNow which is not a dynamic system\n\n\nIf it is just a batch system let's say you bubble gas into a liquid\nstation and uh liquid which is stirred but then the liquid is not moving nor\nout of the system itself then the bulk concentration of the gas will decrease\nbecause more and more being absorbed into the liquid and then the liquid\nconcentration through this absorption will then increases and there will come\na time when the bulk solution will then appear together at the equilibrium\nconcentration and the gas phase we were saying decrease to a concentration\nand this will then be at equilibrium in other words the whole system is at\nequilibrium there is no net transfer that is only for a batch system\n\n\nSo a batch system that movement is transient state\n\n\nAt steady state it is at equilibrium okay the gas concentration the\nsolid concentration the gas phase because now there's no movement the bulk\nand interface and the film will be the same so that concentration will then\nbe at equilibrium with the liquid concentration\n\n\nNow in chemical engineering processes we are dealing mostly with\nsteady state phenomena so this particular case illustrated here is of imp of\nimportance\n\n\nSo here now we say N-A-Z that's the amount of A transfer in phase\none is related to K-G times P-A-G minus P-A-I\n\n\nNow this K-G as we said it is a mass transfer coefficient\n\n\nNow the unit N-A will depends on how you define K-G alright\n\n\nIf you define K-G based on the unit per square area then N-A will\nbe <unclear> word </unclear> per second per metre square in S-I unit\n\n\nOkay P-A of course it is impartial pressure so your K-A must\nconvert that partial pressure into the <unclear> word </unclear> of places\nright\n\n\nSo here your units are very important\n\n\nNow for phase two similarly we have K-L C-A-I minus C-A-L\n\n\nNow K-L is the mass transfer coefficient in the liquid phase\n\n\nNow sometime we use the word film on top of it partly to identify\nthat this relates to a special phase itself to phase one to phase two so\nusually we says film mass transfer coefficient\n\n\nLater on you know why we have to use the word film to differentiate\nfrom what we call the overall mass transfer coefficient \n\n\nNow this is no different from your heat transfer lecture given by\nDr Neo right We have our individual film transfer coefficient and later on we\nhave our overall film transfer coefficent Now this diagram here illustrate\nthe equilibrium relationship between the two phases relating to this\nparticular solute A and this eq the equilibrium curve this arbitrary it can\nbe described by a given equilibrium relationship If it is described by\nHenry's Law then that is not a <unclear> word </unclear> relationship it is a\nlinear relationship okay Now here we can see that at the interface the\ncomposition is represented on the equilibrium curve and if you look at this\nthe slope of this line joining the P-A-G and C-A-L that particular point in\nother word it describe the bulk concentration to the interface composition\nThat slope is given by minus K-L over K-G It's a ratio of the two mass\ntransfer coefficient Now this are not dimensionless ah The slope is not\ndimensionless because K-L and K-G has different dimension depending on how\nyou what is the concentration uh composition you are using Here we are using\npartial pressure and molar concentration Now if you change both of this\nrelationship to molar composition then it is dimensionless

were are the problems\nwith section five which have either been solved or not solved\n\n\nCan we just go through a list of them David\n\n<$D>\n\nI think there's still the difficulty of <unclear>\nword </unclear> that issue if you\n\n<$A>\n\nOkay\n\n<$D>\n\nUse the <unclear> word </unclear> 's evidence to \nquote\n\n<$A>\n\nOkay so so take so try to think of it as a kind of \na a\nstructure okay\n\n\nI mean number one you must know the cases prior to the \namendment\n\n\nWhat were the problems with this thing prior to the \namendment okay\n\n\nAnd then has each one of these problems been solved by \nthe\n<unclear> word </unclear> Amendment\n\n\nIf so how if it hasn't why or has it created new \nproblems I mean I mean that's the basic structure which which I want you to look \nat\n\n\nOkay you you say it hasn't solved the framing of the \nissue of question why\n\n\n\n\n<$D>\n\nBecause there's there's been no direction made out \nas to uhm how you  how you frame the issue\n\n<$A>\n\nHello yah hi Debbie nope no why on what how about \nyourself not\ncoming uh not coming is it\n\n\nThat's what announcement do you want\n\n\nOkay I'll ask her you don't want them is it\n\n\nMichael is doing a lecture\n\n\nUhm ya I think\n\n\nOkay don't don't don't too much\n\n\nIt's semi-terrorism\n\n\nWe'll tell Michael okay\n\n\nI'll tell him whether you need them but uh ya it's okay\n\n\nBye Okay framing of <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$D>\n\nUhm\n\n<$A>\n\nAre you still reading that one\n\n<$B>\n\nNo I just I need the three act the acting one\n\n<$A>\n\nUhm you should read the other one lah\n\n<$B>\n\nUhm\n\n<$A>\n\nWhich I'm sure your have read\n\n<$B>\n\nUhm\n\n<$A>\n\nOkay yes David go on\n\n<$D>\n\nBecause uh compared to the prior to the amendment there's an an uh new <unclear> \nword </unclear> and a and amendment uhm there's there's no additional \ninstruction laid down as to how you should approach and frame the issue\n\n<$A>\n\nOkay so you you're starting out by assuming that framing the issue of question \nis a problem uh\n\n<$B>\n\nUhm\n\n<$A>\n\nI assume\n\n<$D>\n\nYes\n\n<$A>\n\nSo will you think that there're different levels of framing the issue\n\n\nAt certain levels if you frame the issue it could possibly question of issue \n<unclear> word </unclear> other levels no \n\n\nBut what do you think uh Su Ann\n\n\nWill you have problem\n\n<$B>\n\nNot very sure uhm I think it depends on which approach you want to uh you want \nto take\n\n\nIf you set the actions approach which seems to be the \nfavourite approach nowadays then you don't have to\n\n<$A>\n\nUhm you see that's one way of actually without \nlooking at the <unclear> word </unclear> amendments trying to solve the problem \nwithin the cases itself\n\n\nThat that's one way of seeing\n\n\nWell the problem only exists under Lon and Dalton's approach\n\n\nIf you look at <unclear> word </unclear> 's way of framing or frame\nthe issue of question then the problem won't exist\n\n\nAnything\n\n\nAnd and how would you do it yah\n\n<$C>\n\nFor acting's approach got to oh you know what \n<unclear> word </unclear> all is\n\n<$A>\n\nAh okay that that could be a problem or okay that \nthat see that's a problem which will not exist for uh would never have existed \nunder <unclear> word </unclear> 's approach\n\n\nBut now exists under Atkins' approach\n\n\nAnd the problem is even if you were to say that okay \nthat that's the first first difficulty right framing of issue of question\n\n\nLet's go on to the next one\n\n\nWe'll sort of follow from what you said earlier on\n\n\nNumber one Atkins if you follow Atkins approach in \nframing the issue of question I want you to know the meaning of multicarlaw\n\n\nThat has not been settled\n\n\nOf course unless the legislative said we leave it to \nthe cases to decide I mean basically it's the Common Law that <unclear> word \n</unclear> that gives us law\n\n\nNot really satisfactory but but you know there's been \nan entire range of dicta right\n\n\nSome cases say well mercantile law's not the same as \nlaw merchant then you've got <unclear> word </unclear> <unclear> word </unclear> \n<unclear> word </unclear> and the and the earlier ones I mean <unclear> word \n</unclear> the whole range of definitions from mercantile law plus you see under \nLord Dalton's approach this would not have been a problem at all because the law\nthere would have meant English law\n\n\nOkay but if you take the words with respect to those \nmatters as having qualified the law with strictly to with strictly to mercantile \nlaw then again the definition of mercantile law becomes important you see which\nagain is non-settlement yah but the law any problem Siew Hwa\n\n\nThe law with respect to those matters\n\n\nWas it necessary\n\n\nAny anything it solves\n\n<$E>\n\nUhm the word law itself\n\n<$A>\n\nBe that the law the applicable law see you covered \nthe <unclear> word </unclear> you covered the definition what about the\napplicable law\n\n\nHas that been settled\n\n\nWas it a problem as the amendment have\n\n<$E>\n\nIt's still a problem\n\n<$A>\n\n Why\n\n<$E>\n\nHas it has it to do with the section\n\n\nYou're talking about written law\n\n<$A>\n\nNo no no not that section\n\n\nThe applicable law uhm the law which comes in via \nsection five\n\n<$D>\n\nWell it seems that I think the amendments is \ntrying to qualify that the law the law can be applied in Singapore\n\n<$A>\n\nOkay so again you have two diff conflicting approaches under\n\n\nYou have to explain the problem\n\n\nLord Dalton's approach the whole law of English the \nwhole of English sort of come in Atkins' approach only mercantile law does come \nin\n\n\nSo you've got two different approaches\n\n\nNow again has that been settled by the <unclear> word \n</unclear> amendment\n\n\nSo divided the words with respect to this matter\n\n\nYou see for each one of them you start out by saying \nokay number one there were two different approaches\n\n\nWas there a problem I mean was it was it a conflict or \nwas it more of a a <unclear> word </unclear> you know was there a conflict\n\n\nIf there's a conflict it's <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nIf there's no conflict then <unclear> word </unclear> \namendments really <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nDo you uh you don't have to say everything was a \nproblem\n\n\nYou may say that I think although that \n\n\nHello hello yep okay alright thanks bye\n\n\nYou see just remember if it's not a conflict at all \nthen you don't have to to go on and really try to see whether it solve the \nproblem like like for example let me take a more fundamental point\n\n\nDo you think that the two approaches are in conflict \nwith one another\n\n<$D>\n\nYes\n\n<$A>\n\nDo you think the approaches are conflicting enough\n\n\nThink carefully I mean if you say that they are \nconflicting approaches fine uhm bear in mind except Lord Atkins says he does not \ndisagree with Lord Dalton\n\n\nDo you think they are conflicting approaches\n\n\nYou may argue they are conflicting in the sense that \nthey lead to totally different results or someone may argue that well they're \nnot really conflicting they are the same\n\n\nIt's just that the starting point of the entire thing \nis different which actually lead to different results but the approaches are \nitself not conflicting\n\n<$B>\n\nBut I don't I don't see how the approaches are the same\n\n<$A>\n\nOkay it's the same issue of question okay the law \ncan be applied okay qualification correct\n\n<$B>\n\nBut the law we applied is different\n\n<$A>\n\nOnly because when you frame the issue of question \nyou frame the issue but or question by looking at the mercan at at the law\n\n\nSo if the law is mercantile law there'll be a issue of \nquestion restrict to mercantile law which means the law coming in would be \nmercantile law it has to be\n\n\nBut the issue in the statute of the question is not \nmercantile law no issue of question with respect to mercantile law it won't come \nin\n\n\nDo you follow\n\n\nThe starting point actually <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nYou will say that that could mean that the approach is \nthe same or one could equally argue <unclear> word </unclear> they're completely\ndifferent\n\n<$B>\n\nOh\n\n<$A>\n\nRight 'cos it leads to completely different results as in\nentire different way because that is not the way Lord Dalton will frame the\nissue of question law you know Lord Atkins frames it in a very different way\nI mean you can come to completely different results but you you don't have to\nsort of take what the book says is correct all the time\n\n\nOkay okay uhm the law with respect to those matters\n\n\nWhat used to come in and <unclear> word </unclear> the \namendments up\n\n\nDavid you said\n\n<$D>\n\nYah I think uhm the amendment was trying was \ntrying to qualify the law applicable in Singapore because he added in 'with \nrespect to those matters' so I would think they would be trying to qualify uh \nthe law to maybe laws relating to banking principles and etcetera\n\n<$A>\n\nOr you can say you think that there was a \n<unclear> word </unclear> and that this makes it clear that not all law comes in \nbut only mercantile law comes in\n\n<$D>\n\nYah\n\n<$A>\n\nAt this stage I mean you can compare this with \nthe object and purpose of section five and and again you got a whole string of \n<unclear> word </unclear> law\n\n\nYou think the amendment makes it more consistent with \nour object and purpose of section five\n\n<$B>\n\nIt it qualifies the law to be applied to that \nrestricted to mercantile law only\n\n<$A>\n\nOkay fine\n\n\nAny other problem on this section ah in in the old uh \nin the amend pre-amendment cases\n\n\nDon't don't look at the <unclear> word </unclear> okay\n\n\nLook at the cases first\n\n\nAsk yourself okay what were all the problems that exist\n\n\nOkay you've covered the issue of question okay you covered the law\napplicable we've covered the problems of definition of mercantile law we've\ncovered the question of whether the two approaches are different\n\n\nWhat other problems you think you're interested\n\n<$D>\n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A>\n\nOkay <unclear> word </unclear> Okay before we talk <unclear>\nword </unclear> can we talk about the general applicability\n\n\nNow you remember that was never a problem until <unclear> word\n</unclear> 'cos it's it's something they never really have to consider\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nNo in <unclear> word </unclear> you find that all three courts\ndon't want the money lent back to the client\n\n\nThe more important dictas the is to be shift one to the High Court\n\n\nI think it's uhm <unclear> word </unclear> very good dictum at the\nlast paragraph uh that the moneylender side are not capable of this thing\ntheir sections are so interdependent provides for machinery and everything\nelse\n\n\nNow look at the dicta\n\n\nThey'll give the case okay\n\n\nCan you take the last paragraph <unclear> word </unclear>\nactivities okay\n\n\nYou have the case with you Su Ann\n\n\nYou think so\n\n\nGood I'm sure you'll find it\n\n\nThe last para okay no it's it's a very im important point\n\n\nThe High Court <unclear> word </unclear> activity\n\n\nYou didn't have it\n\n\nDo you have it\n\n\nThe High Court <unclear> word </unclear> will shakes up\n\n\nCan't be that difficult to find\n\n<$B>\n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A>\n\nYah okay read read the last paragraph\n\n<$B>\n\nOkay uhm I'll like the defence of the real act\n\n\nhese acts in question have no white imperial concern \nor <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nThey are very special municipal ways of legislating \nthe region creating creating procedure and machinery and setting up restrictions \nand sanctions which are quite impossible to Christian ideas\n\n<$A>\n\nOkay let's let's just stop there\n\n\nDo you think that they're very special municipal ways \nof provision creating procedure and machinery setting up restrictions and \nsections penalty uh\n\n\nAh impossible application okay\n\n\nNow ask yourself carefully is this is he talking \ngenerally about ah acts suitable or not suitable or is he saying that if an act \ncreates for procedure and machinery and sets up restrictions and sanctions \nrestrictions can be probably licensing and sanctions will be penalty\n\n\nAre his remarks directed at a general applicability \ntest or he's talking about a specific <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B>\n\nMoneylender's Act\n\n<$A>\n\nNo not so much moneylender's act\n\n\nIs he talking about an act which creates restrictions \nsanctions procedure and machinery\n\n\nIs he talking about that \n\n\nDo you know what I mean\n\n\nIt's interesting because you you take you see okay \nthen you go to look at Lord Atkin Lord okay because he to create this exception \nuhm <unclear> word </unclear> relied on the word perfect law and its application\ncorrect and and that has been discredited so that is all\n\n\nNow Lord Atkin does the same thing Right Lord Atkin \nsays the same thing He says oh you know there's an implied exception correct not \nfound there but but hid it's an implied <unclear> word </unclear> and this the\nthing that Soon and Pang criticise Right they they say that oh section five\nit's not possible for section five to have this implied exception not found\nwithin the words of the section itself They criticise that part okay So the\nnext question we went on to uh the section five three a allow for this\nsuitability test and to that the answer was no because five three a says\nmodify and adapt whatever has already come in but the suitability test\napplies at the stage where it determines whether not something comes in so\nthat can't be the one so that that they've argued it as a problem right And\nthink about it carefully If what um <unclear> word </unclear> activity did\nwhat Lord Atkin wa talking about in fact Atkin's remark was somewhat similar\nto her I'm not a general suitability test but they're only talking about acts\nwhich create licensing you know concerned with licensing penalties\nregistration Is that exception provided in <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$B>\n\nYa\n\n<$A>\n\nIt is you see Do you do you see again it it depends on how you read the cases if \nyou say well here they were not I mean they were not so specific as to talk \nabout registration\nsanctions and and procedure and everything They're talking\nabout suitability test okay and Lord Atkin talks about the implied suitability \ntest not found within the words of section five So that was the problem Where \ndid he find the legislative\nbasis for it Then you ask yourself That's the nineteen seventy nine\namendment solved then Give you the problem now it doesn't really solve that \nright Because Soon and Pang say modify that and that cannot mean suitability But \nif you start out by saying wer um the words uhm which <unclear> word </unclear> \nactivity gave and \nLord Atkin says I'm not a general suitability test but I'll confine to act\ns which create procedure and machinery licensing and penalty that has been \nprovided for under this amendment so that problem has\nbeen solved as well and there's no need and so the bulk argument as well\nthere's no need for a general applicability test Well I mean that that's their \nbasic premise They say no you don't have to have a general applicability test \nthen that is solved but then that depends on how you read it If you read this as \na wide applicability test then of course you'll have problems later on that's \nall", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a53c28a0-f058-44ca-8d6e-d050ef854692", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.528426+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\n\n\nGood morning I hope you don't mind my starting now \nbut we have\nquite a lot of materials to get through today alright\n\n\n\nOur last lecture on vicarious liability\n\n\n\nSo let's continue there\n\n\n\nNow last week yah I was starting to go through some of \nthe rules by\n<unclear> word </unclear> when an act of an employee is done within the force\nof employment\n\n\n\nAs I said the phrase force of employment is used rather \nlikely used\nin the phrase\n\n\n\nYou take care and a lot of things <unclear> word \n</unclear> yah\n\n\n\nAs far as I carry the liability of return this phrase \nindicates when\npolicy would tend to make an employer liable to the act of an employee right\n\n\n\nSo first we have to define what the employee's duties \nare that's\nlogically first step in the analysis\n\n\n\nThe next thing is to try to find the connection between \nwhat the\nemployee has done and tort to his people complain of and the employer because\nat the end of the day we want to make the employer liable right\n\n\n\nNow after talking a little bit about connection I went \ninto some\nsituation because as I say it is the the convention is divide the acts of\nemployees into two basic types careless acts by the employee\n\n\n\nIn other words where the tort arises from a careless \nact of the\nemployee and deliberate act when the tort was committed deliberately alright\n\n\n\nBecause then show differentiation in these two \ncategories is\nnecessary because it much easier to say that the employer is liable where the\ntort was merely committed carelessly where the tort was committed\ndeliberately by the employee then the employer has far better chance of\nescaping liability right\n\n\n\nThat's the conventional classification and I've already \ntalked\nabout careless acts by the employee right\n\n\n\nNow I'm introducing another category category which I \nthink is\nuseful for our analysis because really there are acts which fall in between\nthe class careless act by the employee leading to the tort and when we talk\nabout careless act here we're talking about careless act within the normal\nduties of the employee right\n\n\n\nAnd then there are deliberate tort deliberate tort \ncommitted by the\nemployee for which the employer doesn't tend to be liable\n\n\n\nThere is what I call intermediate position and the \nterminology is\nmy own\n\n\n\nThis intermediate position has elements of both right\n\n\n\nWhere we have intermediate position like this we're \nalready talking\nabout an employee who has deliberately done what he's not supposed to do as\nfar as his employer's concerned\n\n\n\nHe departed from his usual duties deliberately but the \ntort arises\nout of his carelessness right\n\n\n\nSo different from deliberate tort by the employee \nbecause the\nemployee did not actually intend to cause harm right\n\n\n\nIt's different from deliberate tort which we're going \nto discuss in\na while\n\n\n\nIt's deliberate from the pure careless tort which I was \ndiscussing\nearlier because here the employee isn't so much acting within his normal duty\n\n\n\nHe has done something that's a little bit different \nfrom what the\nemployee sorry what the employer really intended him to do right\n\n\n\nThis intermediate position it doesn't fall nicely into \neither\nclassification and so I think we can usefully discuss it separately\n\n\n\nNow I <unclear> word </unclear> there were blank looks \nlast week\nwhen I'm was making that point sorry last Tuesday so let's just take an\nexample of what I consider to be intermediate position right\n\n\n\nA case which should be familiar to you right now from \nour lectures\non Richard on sat Richard statutory duty ICI Chapel right\n\n\n\nYou remember in that case <unclear> word </unclear> was \nsupposed to\nfollow certain procedures\n\n\n\nThey were supposed to follow certain procedures when \nsetting off\nexplosives or sorry when testing connection and things like that\n\n\n\nThey decided not to follow these procedures yah and \nthere was an\nexplosion an injury was sustained\n\n\n\nNow the injury was not deliberately caused right\n\n\n\nNobody actually set out to hurt anybody but there was a \ndeliberate\ndeparture on the part of the employees from what they were supposed to do\n\n\n\nThey were supposed to test the connection in a certain \nway they\ndecided not to do it\n\n\n\nThey decided to do it in a way which they were told not \nto do it\nright\n\n\n\nSo this is an illustration of what I call the \nintermediate position\n\n\n\nThe harm is not caused deliberately but it flows \nbecause the\nemployee has deliberately departed from what should be his proper duty\n\n\n\nAnother example of that would be <unclear> word \n</unclear> also a\nbreach of statutory duty <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\n\nLook that up yourself\n\n\n\nThese cases I think you will recall resulted in the \nemployee sorry\nin the employer not being vicariously liable right\n\n\n\nThere was vicarious the employer's <unclear> word \n</unclear>\nvicarious liability there which should be indicate to you that this really\ncan be treated differently from the pure careless act\n\n\n\nIt's very difficult for the employer to escape \nvicarious liability\nfor a pure careless act occurring as a result of the employee performing his\nduties properly if carelessly\n\n\n\nBut in this intermediate position it is slightly easier \nfor the\nemployer to escape vicarious liability\n\n\n\nExamples of where the another example of where the \nemployer escapes\nvicarious liability would be for instance the case of Storey and Ashton right\n\n\n\nThis is the case that would be in most of the case \nbooks so I'll\nleave you to look it up yourself except that I'd like you to note that here\nit involves someone who has finished his duties he had completed his duties\nin other words and what he did was he took a ride yah he took a ride after\nthat to visit someone\n\n\n\nIt was a personal visit using his employee's carriage\n\n\n\nWhile on the way for this personal visit he got into an \naccident\n\n\n\nSomeone was injured\n\n\n\nSo was the employer vicariously liable for his \ncarelessness here\n\n\n\nThe answer was no\n\n\n\nThe employee's duties had ended right\n\n\n\nThe court used the phrase that ah that employee had \ngone on a\nfrolic of his own\n\n\n\nThis word <unclear> word </unclear> sample phrases that \nI'm\nconfident will end up in your vocabulary before very long\n\n\n\nJust like phrases like floodgates of liability and very \noften been\nmisused\n\n\n\nBut that really is a phrase which gets used from time \nto time when\nwe're talking about the employee's duties yah\n\n\n\nThe stage he has departed from his duties in a manner \nsufficient to\nspare the employer liable\n\n\n\nWe often use the phrase the employee went on a frolic \nof his own\n\n\n\nThat indicates the connection with the employment it's \nnot\nsufficient to found vicarious liability right\n\n\n\nAs I said the test in these kinds of situation would be \nwhether or\nnot tortious conduct the accident while travelling with your friend yah is\nreasonably incidental to the performance of your duties\n\n\n\nIn Storey and Ashton it's pretty clear that it wasn't \nreasonably\nincidental because the employee had finished doing what he was supposed to do\n\n\n\nHe had finished making all deliveries so there was an \ninsufficient\nconnection there\n\n\n\nBut no not all departures from duties will amount to a \nfrolic\n\n\n\nAn example of a case where it wasn't frolic it's \nWhatman and\nPearson which was mentioned earlier\n\n\n\nThis is a case where an employee was told not to go \nhome for lunch\nuh and leave some <unclear> word </unclear> unattended the employee did so\n\n\n\nThe horses ran ran wild caused some injury and the \nemployer was\nheld vicariously liable for those injuries even though he <unclear> word\n</unclear> from the deliberate departure by the employee from what he was\ntold to do\n\n\n\nThat what I call the intermediate position as I said it \nlies\nbetween deliberate acts and careless acts Careless acts very hard for the\nemployer to escape vicarious liability\n\n\n\nDeliberate acts more easy for the employer to escape \nvicarious\nliability\n\n\n\nAn example of a deliberate tort by the employee yah for \nwhich the\nemployer was not held liable would be a local case that went up to the Privy\nCouncil Keppel Bus Company and Sa'ad Bin Ahmad\n\n\n\nThis is an this is a case from Singapore I I don't \nthink many of\nyou are old enough to remember there was a Keppel Bus Company but this case\nreally is a stuff which New Paper headlines are made\n\n\n\nConductor attacks passenger\n\n\n\nThat's what happened\n\n\n\nThe conductor was one of those that fortunately we \ndon't have\nanymore yah uhm he was he was abusing a passenger\n\n\n\nThe plaintiff like a hero went up and tried to tick the \nconductor\noff and got a ticket punched in his eye\n\n\n\nNow this case is really a very good advertisement for \nOMO\n\n\n\nUhm the plaintiff lost his eye as a result of this \nassault and he\nsued the employer right\n\n\n\nAs I said there would have been no point in this case \ntrying to sue\nthe employer\n\n\n\nThis is a mere bus conductor who would have been \nearning two three\nhundred dollars a month yah\n\n\n\nHow's he going to make good the loss of the eye\n\n\n\nAnswer he can't\n\n\n\nSo the plaintiff tried suing the employer Keppel Bus \nCompany and\nwhat was decided in that case\n\n\n\nAnswer the employee's conduct was deliberate wrongdoing \nby the\nemployee\n\n\n\nIt was deliberate wrongdoing so the employer should not \nbe\nvicariously liable\n\n\n\nNow another example of a situation where deliberate \nconduct spares\nthe employer vicarious liability deliberate tort yah would spare the employer\nvicarious liability\n\n\n\nIt's a fairly similar case Warren and Henley\n\n\n\nThis time in England\n\n\n\nA garage station attendant who gets a strange idea in \nhis head and\nstarts accusing a passenger of non-payment sorry uh a customer of not paying\nhis bill\n\n\n\nCustomer gets upset says some things to the to the \nattendant\n\n\n\nAttendant flies into a rage and hits the pa the \ncustomer\n\n\n\nNow again the court said the employer was not liable \nbecause this\nwas an assault\n\n\n\nIt was pure vengeance on the part of the employee\n\n\n\nIt's not connected with employment\n\n\n\nIt's deliberate act and therefore the deliberateness of \nthe assault\nsevered the connection with his employment even though he did it during\noffice hours yah even though he did it because he was in that position\nbecause he was employed by the by the employer there was still not sufficient\ncon uh connection\n\n\n\nThe deliberateness severed the connection that's \nnecessary to make\nthe employer liable for the tort\n\n\n\nIt would be nice if we could say the uh the employer \nwas never\nliable for deliberate act but I'm afraid life is not so simple because there\nare deliberate acts where employers still are liable for the torts right\n\n\n\nOne example is Poland and John Parr\n\n\n\nThis is a case again on assault where the employee saw \nthe\nplaintiff and thought the plaintiff was trying to steal the employer's\ngoodies from all the carriage\n\n\n\nSo the employee gave the plaintiff a good hard knock\n\n\n\nThe plaintiff fell down under the wheels of the \ncarriage and had\nhis arm broken right\n\n\n\nUhm in that case however the court said the employer \nwas\nvicariously liable\n\n\n\nSo even though it was a deliberate assault on the part \nof the\nemployee\n\n\n\nThe employer was still vicariously liable\n\n\n\nIn other words deliberate conduct doesn't always \nsevered the\nconnection between the tort and the employer\n\n\n\nThere may be vicarious liability So when will there be \nvicarious\nliability a deliberate conduct and when will the employer escape\n\n\n\nI think the answer lies in looking at the nature of \nthe conduct\nand whether or not there is benefit to the employer from that conduct right\n\n\n\nNow when we talk about conduct again I would avoid \ndefining\nconduct too narrowly\n\n\n\nWe're not talking about whether or not the employer \nbenefited from\nthe blow being struck by the employee in Poland and Paar right\n\n\n\nWe're talking about whether the employee thought he \nwas something\nfor the benefit of the employer in other words guarding the goods right\n\n\n\nCompare that for instance the Keppel Bus Company and \nSa'ad Bin\nAhmad and Warren and Henley right \n\n\n\nThose are situations where the conduct clearly didn't \nbenefit the\nemployer The employee was simply doing it for revenge for his own purposes He\nwasn't trying to benefit the employer Now in the Privy Council in Keppel Bus\nand Sa'ad Bin Ahmad the court mentioned for instance that the plaintiff might\nhave recovered from the employee employer The employer might have been\nvicariously liable if the bus conductor's conduct at that time had been\nconnected with his duties as bus conductor So if for instance the bus\nconductor had been trying to maintain order on an unruly bus passengers were\nscreaming and shouting He was trying to push people back into the seat right\nAnd he committed an assault in the course of trying to do that then that\nwould be related enough to his duties that the employer would have been\nvicariously liable There is then potentially a connection a connection if a\nconnection can be made between what the employee is doing and the benefit of\nthe employer then the employer may still be vicariously liable even though\nthe tort has been committed deliberately But when you have clear situations\nlike Keppel Bus Company and Sa'ad Bin Ahmad and Warren and Henley when\nassault by the employee were absolute were purely personal there was no\nthinking on the part of the employee that I'm doing this for the good of my\nemployer then the employer would escape vicarious liability for the\ndeliberate tort of the employee right Simple enough isn't it", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nOkay let's get started\n\n\nUhm I'm going to give you a handout\n\n\nIt's uh there's uh those are the things you're going to \ndo today\n\n\nI don't know how you're feeling today\n\n\nNot too good for me I've got a sore finger uh\n\n\nOkay let's get started\n\n\nWe're going to talk about uh working with parents today \nand uh this\ngoing to be very important because when you go to the primary schools you'll\nbe working a lot with parents a lot more than when you are in secondary\nschool alright\n\n\nSo we're going to look at different aspects of uh \nparent-teacher\nrelationship and why is it important to establish good relationship with\nparents okay\n\n\nDo you think you could get settled down and yah\n\n\nOkay so uh to start off we want to talk about the \ndifferent types\nof uh school-home relationships\n\n\nUhm I re I think most of us are from different types of \nschools uhm\nperhaps government schools and others the uh the government-aided school\n\n\nSo there are actually different types of relationships \nthat these\nschools have with the family or with parents uh only like to suggest that the\nvery first type of school is what 'keep out' you know\n\n\nThis this school will probably say hey you know we we \nrun the\nbusiness we know all about education so you just do your parenting at home\nand leave us alone alright keep out\n\n\nSo I I think you might have seen signs around in \nschools that say 'Parents\nmust not enter the school premises unless the the alright\n\n\nAnd there are some other schools called usual school \nand these are\nthe school that say 'Okay if you wanna come in you are welcome but if you\nwant if you don't want to come to school that's alright too\n\n\nI mean we've called upon you and you don't want to come \nthat's fine\n\n\nIf you want to come that's fine too usual type\n\n\nAnd then of course there are the P-T-A school\nparent-teacher association\n\n\nUhm I think a number of schools in Singapore have taken \nthis kind\nof approach now but mainly I think the pity is that most of them <unclear>\nword </unclear> to fund raising\n\n\nYou know they are referring to curtains ah wanna donate \nmoney to\nbuild the swimming pool and things like that\n\n\nThat's about it alright\n\n\nAnd of course there are the true community schools \nwhere uh surely\nyou read the report about the new Raffles Girls' school where they're going\nto have uh open up the school premises for computer classes <unclear> word\n</unclear> in the evening alright where they're going to welcome parents in\nto uhm conduct courses for the students in there okay that's a community\nschool\n\n\nSo when you go to school the next time you're going to \nsee for\nyourself what what what kind of school do you think your school falls under\n\n\nWhat category does it fall under okay\n\n\nSo that's that's just to start you off with types of \nhome-school\nrelationship\n\n\nUhm let's see why is it important to establish good \nparent-teacher\nrelationship interaction\n\n\nYou know when the parents come to school uhm they they \nactually see\nhow the school operates especially the primary school they like to but they\nkeep them out isn't it\n\n\nIn primary one they are not allowed to go in but they \nthey still\npeep through the windows and see what's happening\n\n\nSo they can see the learning environment and they can \nknow what's\nthe school programs are\n\n\nThey they they can look at the notice board and see uh \nwhat sort of\n<unclear> word </unclear> programs there are what sort of E-C-A activities\nthere are alright\n\n\nWhat sort of medium programs and all okay\n\n\nSo they can actually see uh how teachers teach \nsometimes or maybe\nin talking to the teachers they can know what sort of teachers there are in\nschool uh what sort of approaches they use and things like that\n\n\nAnd very importantly the third point sometimes you may \nhave set\nsome kind of work for students especially weaker ones and you would like them\nto be supervised by their stu uh by their parents at home\n\n\nSo that's when you need parents to supervise and make \nsure that\ntheir children have done the appropriate homework the the assigned homework\nalright\n\n\nAnd sometimes the parents will ask you in school uh \nwhen they talk\nwith the teachers in in the process of talking with the teachers they can\nlearn something about how important the parental role is just a guidance and\nsupervision\n\n\nNot only in academic areas but in the others in social \nemotional\ndevelopment <unclear> word </unclear> right\n\n\nAnd of course parents can make some significant \nsignificant\ncontributions to the school\n\n\nAh not sure whether you re have read articles about uh \nschools like\nSt Nicholas\n\n\nHave you read anything about the art where they \nactually ask\nparents to come in to talk on certain programs\n\n\nIs anybody familiar with that kind of uh interaction \nthat St\nNicholas school has\n\n\nDo you know what what they do\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nYah they did\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nSingapore teach uh to teach courses\n\n<$A> \n\nTo teach courses I see\n\n\nNow what sort of courses can you\n\n<$B> \n\nStory-telling\n\n<$A> \n\nAh okay story-telling\n\n\nOh parents are involved with reading program\n\n\nThey actually break the children into small groups and \nparents come\nin to read to the kids or they help out in help help out in library work and\nthings like that okay\n\n\nAnd I think they do something about gardening too right\n\n\nSo that's an avenue you can tap parents' expertise\n\n\nOkay so we say that parents need teachers because \nparents can see\nall these things happening but teachers also need parents because they can\nuse parents to be a member of the teaching team\n\n\nIt means uh whatever aspect in school the parents can \ngo back and\nsupervise their children alright\n\n\nI'm not sure whether you're familiar with this term \ncalled\ncontracting\n\n\nSometimes when the kids come to see you and this kid uh \nnot very\nwell-disciplined so you wanna have a contract some kind of a time-table\nalright to say that hey watch less of TV and spend that two hours doing Maths\nsomething like that\n\n\nYou know when you see the parents and you may wanna \ngive that\ncontract with the time-table that kind of thing\n\n\nWill you please supervise your child every night for \ntwo hours\nalright\n\n\nSo the parents can be a member of the teaching team and \nthen they\ncan provide supportive and extend <unclear> word </unclear> experiences\nmeaning if they can actually <unclear> word </unclear> their children out in\nperhaps assessment work you know other <unclear> word </unclear> activities\nat home\n\n\nWhat sort of uh educational toys they can buy for their \nchildren\n\n\nOkay and then by doing that you you hope to see a \nsnowball effect\n\n\nOther parents see that hey uh these parents are \nactually <unclear>\nword </unclear> quite involvement with their children's work maybe we should\ndo likewise or or maybe we should get other parents together and and and come\ntogether to school and uh and help out in the school management or other\nschool committee alright\n\n\nSo I hope you can see uh the importance of P-T \ninteraction from\nthere but very often more often than not you hear about complaints about\nparents right\n\n\nLater on we will talk about problem parents okay and \nhow to handle\nthem\n\n\nOkay so after stating the importance of uh P-T \ninteraction what are\nthe ways we can ensure that this kind of interaction work out\n\n\nI'm not sure whether you might have some ideas\n\n\nI'm sure you can think of meet the parents right\n\n\nDid your parents ever go to your school when you were \nin school\n\n\nHow many of you how many of your parents did\n\n\nNone of you \n\n\nI think they've this thing called Meet the Parents and \nthey've lots\nof concerts where they invite parents right\n\n\nUh I don't know how many of your parents went to school\n\n\nOkay this some of the ways to establish good \nrelationship with the\nto make the school as a welcoming place\n\n\nUh well as <unclear> word </unclear> says inviting \nschool lah you\nknow facilitating this inviting environment\n\n\nAre there things around parents can walk in and see \nthat they know\nthat they are welcomed alright\n\n\nThey'll talk about I know the oversea they talk about \nparents' room\nthey even have special bulletin boards for parents you know when they can\nhold up some information for parents\n\n\nI'm not sure whether this is done in Singapore I don't \nthink any\nschool has a parent room\n\n\nI'm not sure if the new A-C-S has a parent room I doubt \nit\n\n\nAnyway the idea is to welcome parents coming in\n\n\nThey could for school assembly\n\n\nYou may think that these are very western ideas but uh \nthere'll be\nsome there may be some of them which you can modify and and think about\n\n\nIn the west they talk about morning coffee then uhm you \nknow I\nthink this is done in Singapore where parents help out in outings organising\noutings and taking the children out\n\n\nVery much so <unclear> word </unclear> because they \nthey need\nadults around to supervise the children maybe one adult to five children\n<unclear> word </unclear> small ones you know\n\n\nSo I think parents uh can be asked to fork out there\n\n\nOkay so these are some of the ways and some very \nspecific ways\nwould be uh written communication where there are class bulletins there there\nare newsletters especially for parents got to bring the facts there\n\n\nNow I was in the hospital last time \n\n\nYah okay so there are there are special newsletters for \nparents\ninvolve parents in <unclear> word </unclear> in school and future events and\nuh some achievements of students there and things like that lah okay\n\n\nUh as far I know <unclear> word </unclear> A-C-S has \none Report\nExpress\n\n\nNot sure about other schools\n\n\nHave you come across any\n\n\nI think Heng Boys has one too primary school I because \nmy nephew is\nfrom that school\n\n\nI think they have one <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nDo you know of any other primary schools that give \nletters to\nparents yeh Cedar 'A' yeh\n\n<$C> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nOh it's alright\n\n\nThere are one of those\n\n\nIt's a primary school or second primary school is it\n\n\nOh that's good ya\n\n\nSo the idea is that if there is a this channel of \ncommunication\nwith parents letting the parents know about what's happened in school alright\n\n\nAnd uh school report annual report <unclear> word \n</unclear>\n\n\nNot sure every student gets it but in some schools \nthey do\n\n\nSchool magazines you know alright\n\n\nAnd besides these uh avenues of written communication \nthere are al\nalso a lot of informal discussions that can be carried out but the idea is\nthat the teachers must not feel threatened\n\n\nYou know sometimes when parents come in teachers can \nfeel a bit\nthreatened\n\n\nWhat do you want\n\n\nWhy did what do they complain you know\n\n\nAnd what what do you really want from me\n\n\nUh I I at the other side of the coin some parents also \nfeel that\nwhenever teachers call about it must be that little Tommy is misbehaving\nalright\n\n\nUh so you have to establish this kind of understanding \nthat uh we\ndon't call upon you just because there's some problem right\n\n\nSo that's why these uh morning coffees and uh uh uh at \nevening\njust to meet the parents not just to talk about results you know\n\n\nVery often at meet-the-parents sessions you you hand \nin your\nreport book uh and very often you give your report only when the parent come\ncomes along isn't it\n\n\nAnd we want to make sure that those who fail are the \nparents of\nthose student who fail must turn up alright\n\n\nNo but I think the the kind of <unclear> word \n</unclear> uh\n<unclear> word </unclear> perpetuate the kind of thinking in parents okay\n\n\nSo sometimes you get uh whole conferences where \nparents <unclear>\nword </unclear> I'm saying that certain schools that arrange for talks and\nsessions like uh parenting style and how to be an assertive parent how to\nbring up your child gracefully whatever is \n\n\nThere are such talks around <unclear> word </unclear> \nand then of\ncourse your informal contact Sometimes you will need to interview the parents\nYou're talking about counselling contexts now uh where you want to find out a\nlot more about how the children are a child is like he's at home So you may\nwant to set up parental interview Okay and uh working with parents in a small\ngroups like maybe on a specific for specific problem maybe there are some\nkids with uh problem with the inthing now is obesity ya Terrible <unclear>\nword </unclear> you're a member of the fattish club ya they should say\nsomething like a health club or trimming club ya Maybe their children with\nthat kind of problems alright And and so you might want to get them to\ngenerate and discuss how to help them help their child with this problem\nalright Uhm for specific interest groups And just to reach out to the working\nparents you may want to think about evening informal evenings Uh it's not\nterribly good to have uhm meeting with parents on Saturday morning I mean not\neverybody Well we have to work on Saturday morning Some parents have to work\non Saturday mornings too Maybe a Friday evening or something like that And a\nvery important tool is really home visitation We're talking about home\nvisitation and the counselling technique We're going to link it with what\nyou've done last week counselling Uh what do you do when you go when you have\nto go to a child's home What what can you actually see when you go to\nsomeone's home I'm very tempted to do that exercise Maybe I'll have Why don't\nyou talk to your the person next to you alright and and just tell the person\n<unclear> word </unclear> just about your describe your room to that person\nor your house You can talk about what kind of painting <unclear> word\n</unclear> on the wall whether you have shelves or posters whether you have\nkaraoke sets <unclear> word </unclear>", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "cdeec788-7834-444e-a899-0c5f96d072d7", "added":

{"text": "Although I'm inclined to lock the door\n\n\nAlright I don't need that many handouts since there's only less than\nhalf a class here\n\n\nLet's start on this side\n\n\nSix pages\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nI think we should begin\n\n\nWe've wasted enough time\n\n\nPeople coming late\n\n\nLet's pick up where we stop\n\n\nThe last thing the last lecture we look at the application of\nkinetics in the biological treatment\n\n\nWe left off looking at a simple case simplest case that is a CSTR and\nwe also look at the CSTR that is without recycle\n\n\nUh do you recall your adapt uh your connection activator's sludge and\nall the other arrangements there would almost invariably would have they\nwould have a recycled <unclear> word </unclear> right\n\n\nSo let us look at this case now where there is a recycled <unclear>\nword </unclear>\n\n\nOkay before we have our reactor our CSTR your inflow coming in this\nuh mix well CSTR\n\n\nI suppose to the previous uh arrangement you saw\n\n\nNow we've got a settling unit and part of it is recycled\n\n\nNow in this case our we have sludge wasted from the reactor that is a\ncertain stream is taken off from the reactor\n\n\nI think the previous scheme I showed you uh sludge is wasted from the\nsettling tank right\n\n\nSo these are two possible arrangements you can have either sludge\nwasted from the settling tank i-e here or from the reactor and of course part\nof it is recycled back to the reactor\n\n\nAnd do you recall the there has to be a balance between the part of the\nsludge that is wasted to the sludge that is recycled and I'm sure you know\nwhy there has to be this balance right\n\n\nOkay let us let us now look at the analysis of this arrangement\n\n\nOkay the usual assump usual assumptions made are before two things\n\n\nNumber one x-y is zero that is your inflow comes in where's no\nmicro-organisms\n\n\nOkay this second assumption made well actually it's not this one but 'cos\nyour x by the z is zero alright and and in this case actually we <unclear>\nword </unclear> have another assumption\n\n\nX-e is zero i-e your effluent leaving your settling tank is X X-e\nzero\n\n\nOkay now because of the presence of the settling unit you made two\nadditional assumptions\n\n\nFirst of all waste stabilisation occurs only in the reactor that is\nhere\n\n\nThat means you're saying there is no waste stabilisation occurring in\nthe settling tank\n\n\nNow this of course will be conservative since there will be some\ndegree of waste stabilisation by the micro-organisms in the settling unit as\nwell right\n\n\nBut for analysis we make this assumption that any B-O-D ah with\n<unclear> word </unclear> taking place only in this unit Secondly volume use\nin calculating the mean cell residence time all the system includes only the\nvolume of the reactor unit okay\n\n\nSo since this follows up from here right since there's no B-O-D\n<unclear> word </unclear> in this unit alright you may consider the mean cell\nresidence time you only take into account the volume of your reactor\n\n\nOkay so by definition the mean hydraulic retention time all the\nreactor that teta will be d over q v will be your volume of your reactor that\nyour fluid b ah b is constant\n\n\nThis time if you consider hydraulic retention time for the systemthen for the system b will be reactor volume plus <unclear> word </unclear>tank volume alright\n\n\nSo your mean cell residence time teta c we call that definition teta\nc will be mass of cells in the reactor over mass of cells wasted per day\n\n\nMass of cells in the reactor that's v-x in the reactor\n\n\nMass of cells wasted per day that will depend on your scheme alright\n\n\nIf you look at your flow sheet up here\n\n\nIf you look at your reactor mass of cells wasted per day\n\n\nIf you draw an overall uh boundary surface here or control surface\n\n\nOkay cells leaving the boundary would be this one q-w-x plus anycells leaving from the settling tank\n\n\nOkay which is q minus q-w X-e alright\n\n\nQ-w would be <unclear> word </unclear> liquid containing biological\ncells to be wasted from the system\n\n\nOkay in this case from the reactor X-e concentration of your micro-organisms in effluent from the settling unit and\nif you recall we also made the assumptions that X-e is close to zero alright\n\n\nNow this is the case for simple manure proper settling\n\n\nSo the quantity of micro-organisms leaving there don't it's very small\n\n\nX-e approximates to zero\n\n\nThen your mean cells residence time simplifies to q teta c is c over\nq-w alright\n\n\nAnd if you do the mass balance for micro-organisms in the entire\nsystem your accumulation inflow outflow and your net growth accumulation term\n\n\nThe outgrowth this is the amount leaving the reactor the amount\nleaving the settling unit and that will be your net growth\n\n\nSo now we come back to the assumptions we say we usually make\n\n\nAssuming cell concentration and inflow is zero i-e x-y is zero\n\n\nSteady state the x vility is zero then this means this is zero this\nis zero and simplifies to you just bring over this side you get this\nexpression here equals to v multiplied by r-g prime r-g prime being your next\nspecific uh your net growth your net ah bacterial growth rate alright\n\n\nAnd of course your r-g prime is equals to this expression here\nwithout the x term\n\n\nSo if you divide by d-x and if you look at this term here and what we\ndefine as one over teta c in the previous transparency this actually would be\none over teta c alright\n\n\nIn the previous transparency this term here the left hand side term\nis one over teta c\n\n\nFor substituting of teta c the one over teta c is equals to this\nexpression or teta c is y-u minus k-d and if you recall the previous\ntreatment teta c one over teta c is ec of exactly the same expression\n\n\nFor the case of a CSTR without recycle\n\n\nAgain the expression is exactly the same whether or not here is\nrecycle\n\n\nOf course the difference now is how you calculate teta c because now\none over teta c is not for teta c is not the same as teta\n\n\nIn a case where there is no recycle right\n\n\nSo that's <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nOtherwise expression is really the same and substituting your\nsubstrate utilisation your your utilisa your substrate utilisation rate to\nthis expression\n\n\nYou can get your effluent concentration so your your concentration\nwithin the reactor x and of course in the case where there is no recycle\n\n\nThese two terms are the same you cancel out and that will be the term\nthat will be the expression you have seen earlier okay\n\n\nI repeat if there is no recycle teta c equals to teta you cancel out\nso you you see the expression earlier as well\n\n\nAny any question as far Okay now this expression actually would\nsuggest that uh this expression it would suggest that if you reduce the\nhydraulic retention time then your m-l-v-x-s or your x value here would\nincrease in the reactor right\n\n\nDoes it not suggest that\n\n\nIf you increase your hydraulic retention time teta which is v over q\nthen x will increase assuming everything else remains constant alright\n\n\nBut of course there's a limit to to this because if you were to\ndecrease your hydraulic so if you were to increase your hydraulic retention\ntime rather if you de if you decrease your hydraulic retention time x will\nincrease\n\n\nBut if you decrease your hydraulic retention time it also means your\ncells are to be more liable to be washed out alright\n\n\nHydraulic retention time decreases such that it approximates your\ncell regeneration time then your cells will be liable to be washed off right\n\n\nOnce your cells are washed out then your s is going to approximate s\nnought which means you're going to have virtually very little treatment right\n\n\nBut of course I said if you in if you decrease teta c teta rather and\neverything el everything else is held constant but of course you know that\ncannot be true because if you were to decrease if you were to decrease teta c\nteta rather teta c will also be affected right\n\n\nDo you recall the definition of teta teta being v over q v is\nconstant so to decrease this that means you must increase your flow rate q\nright\n\n\nIf you increase your flow rate q teta c would also change in fact\nteta c would decrease as well alright\n\n\nSo we we look at this case where the cells are wasted from the\nreactor as I said the other arrangement which is actually more typical would\nbe like your cells or your sludge wasted from the settling tank\n\n\nSo this second arrangement is actually the more common arrangement\nalright\n\n\nNow instead of a cells being wasted from your reactor now it's taken\nout from your settling unit\n\n\nSo redefining the terms slightly we've got this prime here we can\nthen applying the same definition <unclear> word </unclear> just see for this\ncase\n\n\nThis is the mass of cells in the reactor\n\n\nOf course that's the same mass of cells wasted per day\n\n\nThis time this would be the mass of cells that is wasted from your\nsettling unit that will be the amount leaving your settling unit alright\n\n\nSo distance here will be changed slightly\n\n\nAgain assuming x-e is very small then it simplifies the this\nexpression\n\n\nSo to calculate x which is your concentration of your ah cells within\nthe reactor\n\n\nIt's the same expression as you've seen before same expression except\nthat now teta c takes a different expression alright\n\n\nI have discussed only about x so far\n\n\nWhat about your substrate concentration or your B-O-D which is s\n\n\nWe can do likewise\n\n\nDo a substrate balance okay\n\n\nDo a mass balance for the substrate now for your <unclear> word\n</unclear> system\n\n\nThen you have the x vitity or divide by v q-s nought which is the\nsubstrate coming into the system\n\n\nThe same thing whatever substrate leaves the system and whatever is\nconsumed here you can do the same thing and try to get an expression for s\nalright\n\n\nAny question so far\n\n\nOkay if not with that I'd like to cover our secondary treatment and I\nwant to move on next to discuss about tertiary treatment systems or what is\ncommonly termed also advanced waste water treatment\n\n\nOkay now treat water treatment\n\n\nNow although secondary treatment purposes may reduce more than\neighty-five percent of B-O-D or suspended solids or possibly even more than\neighty-five percent and also nearly all pathogens are removed\n\n\nIf you recall we introduce disinfectants disinfectants\n\n\nHowever only a mi only minor removal of some pollutants is achieved\n\n\nOkay examples of some pollutants of concern because there's only\nminor removal will be things like your nutrients <unclear> word </unclear>\nnitrogen phospherous colloidal particles refractory organics dissolved\ninorganic solids\n\n\nSo these are some of the pollutants that are of concern because\nafter secondary treatment you may have only removed uh a very small\npercentage\n\n\nNow addition treatment used to remove these pollutants are termed\nadvanced waste water treatment or AW-T or tertiary treatment and in order to\nin relation to solving these tough pollution problems i-e taking care of\nthese alright the processes the processes will will be effluent quality to\nthe point that it may be adequate for many reuse purposes alright\n\n\nSo it will convert what will otherwise be a waste water to a\nvaluable resource\n\n\nI think in the case of Singapore this is particularly relevant\nalright because we are relying on water from our neighbours\n\n\nSo this is something of uh relevance in effect it's not only of\nrelevance but importance as well\n\n\nActually recently there was an MOU signed between NUS and ENV\n\n\nThat's Ministry of Environment and amongst the projects we're\nlooking into would be one which we call uh technology development for water\nrenovation \n\n\nWell in a nutshell it's A-W-T\n\n\nAll we're trying to do is to recover or reuse our waste water so\nthat they can be recycled back to the industry and be reused alright", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nOkay good morning class\n\n\nNow we have a guest today\n\n\nBrenda Lee is it\n\n\nYour last name\n\n\nLee\n\n\nShe's here to tape uhm the lecture for uh research\n\n\nUhm today is the last lecture for for the history of music course\n\n\nAh and we'll be covering very briefly uhm compo composers and\ncompositions from the nineteen fifty onwards\n\n\nNone of these compositions that I'll be mentioning are on the wide\nlistening list\n\n\nThese are additional works which you might have to identify to in\nthe unknown so okay please listen to the features of these composition when\nyou ah are listening now uh\n\n\nOkay by the nineteen fifty now a majority of performers and\ncomposers had already familiarised themselves with uhm the twelve tones\nserial technique of Schoenberg <unclear> word </unclear> and Webern as we\nwere discussing two weeks ago\n\n\nUh not all of them accepted the serialisation techniques of these\ncomposers but for those who did such as Babbit B-a-b-b-i-t and Messiaen\n\n\nThose that adopted the twelve tones techniques went further and\nserialised almost all aspects of music composition\n\n\nUh aspects such as anyone\n\n\nWhat else do you think could be serialised\n\n\nOther than notes\n\n\nI mentioned this before\n\n\nHow come you're suddenly silent today\n\n\nWhat else\n\n\nWhat else could be serialised\n\n\nOkay dynamics of course uhm dynamics one aspect\n\n\nOne other aspect\n\n\nRhythm\n\n\nAnother aspect metre metre as two-four three-four tempo and most\nimportantly colour\n\n\nColour as you know from uh Webern's Class Father Melody\n\n\nAlright it opened all tempo possibilities for serialisation\n\n\nOkay Class Father Melody is very important so you'll have to\nremember\n\n\nNow these composers favoured more control with con more control\nover their compositions\n\n\nSo they wanted every aspect of their composition serialised and on\nthe other hand there was another group that favoured less control over their\ncomposition\n\n\nNow these composers included Cage Cage Boulet B-o-u-l-e-t\nStockhausen S-t-o-c-k-h-a-u-s-e-n\n\n\nOf course Stockhausen and Boulet also wrote serial ah serial music\nokay\n\n\nNow there were two opposing camps and one favoured music as thought\nthought processing huh control and the other as sound\n\n\nTwo camps\n\n\nOne is thought and one is sound freedom\n\n\nAlso during the nineteen fif fifties you have another new trend\ninvolving the use of electronically produced and manipulated sounds Its term\ncalled Musique Concrete M-u-s-i-q-u-e C-o-n-c-r-e-t-e where musical tones or\nnational sounds are transformed in various ways by electronic means musical\ntones or national sounds are transformed in various ways by electronic means\nand assembled on a tape to be played back for performance and assembled on a\ntape to be played back in a performance okay\n\n\nSo these compositions are not live compositions they are\npre-recorded compositions\n\n\nThese composers Stockhausen was very uh important uh component of\nthis S-t-o-c-k can be purely electronic sounds\n\n<$B> \n\nI was looking for Studio one\n\n<$A> \n\nYa because Mr Ho's not around\n\n<$B> \n\nAlright\n\n<$A> \n\nNo <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nJust continue okay\n\n\nWe'll tell you later\n\n\nOkay there are composers such as Stockhausen who experimented very\nmuch with Musique Conrete uh and some of them also use uhm purely electronic\nsounds they use uhm synthesizers to make these kind of sounds as opposed to\nStockhausen who use voice as as well as in <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nHi John\n\n\nYou're late\n\n\nAnd because of the stringent requirements of this kind of music\nregarding dynamics uh rhythms of <unclear> word </unclear> minute <unclear>\nword </unclear> speech and intensity of course the electronic studio is ideal\nfor this kind of recording\n\n\nAnd John here discussing uh modern music with for this lecture\n\n\nAlso during this time we had composers who experimented with\ndifferent combinations of instruments with different timbre combinations\nranges and those who expect exploited new sounds that came from old\ninstruments\n\n\nThis is a score of one composer George Crump\n\n\nYou can see very unorthodox way of scoring 'cos it's centric huh\nyou can see and you see the arrows they point uh where the beginning and the\nending of the piece occur and it's scored rather freely\n\n\nUhm you see all these little stars little little asterisks uh\n<unclear> word </unclear> which we learn the last time two weeks ago huh and\nhe makes the uhm electric guitar play with plastic rods a very unusual\ninstrument and combination of that\n\n\nOkay this is the score of George Crump one such composer\n\n\nAlso we had tone clusters very new sounds and they are scored this\nway on this way or like that sometimes okay\n\n\nAnd it can be anything from this to this\n\n\nAnything but the of course the composer would uhm indicate which is\nthe top note and which is the bottom note huh\n\n\nSo this would be written down the the range will be written down\n\n\nOkay composers who wrote for piano\n\n\nOne Henry Cowell American composer who wrote uh music as early as\nthe twenties who wrote this kind of music as early the twenty they\nincorporated tone clusters\n\n\nAnother innovation came from John Cage C-a-g-e we spoke of them\nearlier who wrote very much for the prepared piano prepared piano in the\nnineteen forty where he had bolts screws spoons forks uh rubber eraser uh\ninserted in the strings to create a kind of percussion ensemble\n\n\nNow of course you'll give instructions as to uh the pianist will\nreach for the inner key and play this this string or that string in a\nparticular manner or fashion or to strike a string inside the keyboard rather\nthan on the white key\n\n\nThese are new innovational techniques\n\n\nAlso uh popular were the new harmonics that were explored at this\ntime\n\n\nTechniques new harmonic and new techniques such as the increased\nuse of flutter tongue technique in wind instrument\n\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> you had chromatic clusters and all the\nvoice the spoken word as well uhm as you can see the voice has to speak\ncertain things indicated huh very syllabic words of vowels sometimes or\nwhispered sounds or halfway between voice and speech question mark\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$C> \n\nCan you repeat the part on increased use of tongue\n\n<$A> \n\nFrom John Cage\n\n\nOh in the new there's a new use of harmonics and techniques\ntechniques will include the use of flutter tongue know what I mean\n\n<$C> \n\nWhat is flutter tongue\n\n<$A> \n\nwhere the tongue face and against the palate and and rolls\nthem into the instrument\n\n\nYa\n\n\nWill you demonstrate that again\n\n\nUhm of course you have to blow an instrument at the same time huh\nand do that\n\n\nOkay Glissandos glissandos the chromatic clusters and for the voice\nwe had spoken and whispered sounds as well as <unclear> word </unclear> which\nis in between singing and speech\n\n\nOccasionally the instrumentalists were uh requested to say these\nsounds too to participate vocally rather than just playing\n\n\nThe percussion ensemble well increased in size as well and there\nwas a a greater need for more exotic instruments that were being used\n\n\nInstruments such as the gamalan uhm the gongs more Asian\ninstruments that were used this time\n\n\nFor the sirens when <unclear> word </unclear> siren a fire\ninstrument to be used in the ensemble could actually it's a pity we took the\nuhm projector from here lah\n\n\nUhm I made this transparency to show you the trends that took place\nin the nineteen after nineteen hundred okay\n\n\nYou can see we have experimental tradition right at the top\nnineteen twenties and we have mainstream okay\n\n\nMainstream we have people like Ravel in the mid composing alongside\nand then under experimental tradition we have composers such as Ives\nShoenberg Webern <unclear> word </unclear> huh\n\n\nThey were experimenting the twelve tone technique and various\ninstrumental techniques\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nThen we had twelve tone techniques quarter tone techniques\n\n\nOkay uhm thirties with sound mass noise uhm composers such as\n<unclear> word </unclear> all compose so you see how they uhm the score is\ndone is down\n\n\nIt's grey and black lines and sheets of lines and if you wanna\ncrescendo you see uh expansion of this kind of graphics thicker darker lines\nokay\n\n\nAnd there's no note uh written down just masses of colour or sound\nand after the thirties it branched off into less control and more control\n\n\nSo under less control we have indeterminacy which is a an important\nterm you'll remember and more control ultra serialisation such as Babbit uhm\nBabbit Messiaen who serialised all as other aspects of their music such as\ncolour dynamics ahah\n\n\nSo on this side we have then we went further to go into\ncomputerisation where they use computers to write music uhm\n\n\nOn the right hand side you can see we have use of new instruments\nafter nineteen forties <unclear> word </unclear> is one of them just mention\nhim\n\n\nUhm improvisation techniques like composers uh gave performers a\nfree hand and doing what they want I'll go on further with this and parallel\nto this we see chance music which uh John Cage is a very important proponent\nof this kind of music uhm\n\n\nAnd further down the line before sixties we see new instrumental\ntechnique improvisational groups further on and live electronic music that\ncomes straight down from the experimental tradition and theatre music\nhappenings and anti-art\n\n\nMaybe I'll I'll make a copy of this for you all since you're can't\nread this okay\n\n\nSo you see the tradition of the composers streaming ah taking\nopting for one route or the other but of course during the fifties uh it's a\nvery experimental time and most composers dabbled at one or the other like\nStockhausen's works uh Messiaen Babbit too and some of them would also write\nfor non serial or chance music okay\n\n\nThen we go on to Berio which I'll speak on briefly because uh I\nbrought the CD along the songs for Cathy which Berio wrote for his wife Cathy\nBerberian B-e-r-b-e-r-i-a-n and I'll play the sequenza for you Sequenza Three\nfor voice for his wife which he wrote in fifty six\n\n\nOkay Luciano Berio B-e-r-i-o was born in nineteen twenty five in\n<unclear> word </unclear> nineteen twenty five <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nHe's a composer conductor and teacher and explored much theater\nmusic\n\n\nHe married uh the American singer Cathy Berberian in nineteen\nfifty whom he also wrote extensively for voice\n\n\nHe wrote nine sequenzas in all for various solo instruments piano\nthe harp the trombone the voice and you see in his compositions the sequenzas\nuh a tendency to uhm have very theatrical features in it\n\n\nFor instance the sequenza five were trombone\n\n\nI'll read you the instruction\n\n\nOkay for the trombonist who's supposed to perform this work\n\n\nOkay if you look at the score huh instructions are right at the\ntop and this is the composition itself for the trombonist\n\n\nA very different way of scoring\n\n\nOkay he says this is the instruction uh\n\n\nOn the stage a very low stand and a chair okay so on the stage\nyou're supposed to have a very low stand and a chair stand as in instrumental\nstand\n\n\nWalking on the stage during the performance of section a the\nperformer should wear a white tie\n\n\nCould be a <unclear> word </unclear> or could be a <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n\nStrikes the poses of a variety of showmen about to sing an old\nfavourite right\n\n\nUh inspired he extends his arm raises his and lowers his\ninstrument slowly or quickly uhm with movements which should appear\nspontaneous\n\n\nHe hesitates\n\n\nJust before section b he utters a bewildered why and sits down\nwithout pausing\n\n\nHe must perform section b as though rehearsing in an empty hall\n\n\nOkay these are the instructions very theatrical and you can see\nit's very staged and locations are given here for those who didn't have this\n\n\nNow I'll play for you Sequenza Three which I unfortunately I don't\nhave a score to\n\n\nThis <unclear> word </unclear> is written for his wife Cathy\nBerberian\n\n\nSequenza Three written in nineteen sixty six and it's divided into\nten second bars\n\n\nOkay the bars are timed in ten seconds\n\n\nSo rather than the conventional bars ten second bars and involves\ndetailed and specific features\n\n\nSound tones speech whispers\n\n\nThere are forty four different emotional indications in all and\nthe text is by Markus Kutter \n\n\nThis is the text and it reads 'Give me a few words for a woman to\nsing a truth allowing us to build a house without worrying before

{"text": "<$A> \n\nUhm you can collect them\n\n\nSettle down okay and let's begin\n\n\nTay Seow Ming shocked at your marks is it\n\n\nOkay let's begin\n\n\nGood morn uh good afternoon class\n\n<$B> \n\n\n\n<$A> \n\nSit down alright\n\n\nNow what we will do today for the first half hour or so is I want to\nuhm go through the answers alright for the assignment questions that are\ngiven to you okay\n\n\nYou all settle down please\n\n\nAlright the first assignment question was question five c\n\n\nOkay I think most of you manage to do this question but some of you\nwell I don't know what to say here ah but anyway this is the answer right\n\n\nNow in the question five c you were asked whether a precipitate\nwill form when the pH of a point 01 mole per dm cube solution of magnesium\nchloride is adjusted to ten\n\n\nNow in the previous tutorial I gave you this hint right\n\n\nThe hint the key word is supposed to be pH ten\n\n\nThat means your solution is alkaline\n\n\nAlkaline meaning that there is an excess of OH minus for hydroxide\nion so you have to calculate your concentration of hydroxide ion alright and\nyou do this using your POH value okay\n\n\nSo your concentration for hydroxide will be ten to the power minus\nfour mole per dm cube\n\n\nNow why are you interested in this hydroxide ion concentration\nbecause there's a possibility that your NG two plus that comes from your\nmagnesium chloride and your hydroxide can come together to form your white\nsolid magnesium hydroxide as a precipitate okay\n\n\nRight so you are not concerned about magnesium chloride your\nconcentration of chloride ions\n\n\nYou're more concerned about these two okay\n\n\nSo you have a concentration of hydroxide\n\n\nYou have a concentration of <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nSo what you do is you calculate the ionic product okay\n\n\nUhm some mistakes are you forgot to raise your OH minus expression\nto the power of two okay\n\n\nNow anyway your ionic product will be this value which far exceeds\nyour solubility product of magnesium hydroxide\n\n\nTherefore you can compute that uh precipitate <unclear> word\n</unclear> four okay\n\n\nSo for question five c right you cannot say that since magnesium\nchloride is a soluble salt no precipitate formed\n\n\nYou have to bear uhm bear in mind that it is an alkaline solution\nalright\n\n\nAny questions\n\n\nNo\n\n\nOkay question six question six right uhm for this one what you have\nis a saturated solution of hydrogen sulphide alright\n\n\nNow you are given a specific concentration of metal ion and a\nspecific concentration of hydrochloric acid okay\n\n\nSo your metal ion it's concentration equals to one mole per dm cube\nalright\n\n\nNow your concentration of hydrochloric acid because this is a\nstrong acid it will completely dissociate\n\n\nSo this will be equivalent to the amount of H plus that is present\nin solution which is zero point two five mole per dm cube okay\n\n\nRight\n\n\nNow what we have to do then is to calculate the sulphide ion\nconcentration\n\n\nYou don't know how much of it there is\n\n\nSo what you have to do is you write up the expression okay that has\nbeen given to you you can copy this from your tutorial alright\n\n\nNow some of you make careless mistakes here you forgot to square\nyour expression\n\n\nRight it's been given to you that it's H plus whole thing squared\nbut you didn't do that right\n\n\nNow what value do you substitute inside since the majority of your\nH plus comes from your HCL you use point two five mole per dm cube okay\n\n\nRight\n\n\nNow from this you can solve for your sulphide ion concentration\n\n\nRight the value is one point seven six plus ten to the power of\nminus twenty-two mole per dm cube alright\n\n\nNow the next thing that is of concern to you will the ionic product\nalright exceed the Ksp for your metal sulphide or will it be less than okay\n\n\nBecause if it is less than there will be no precipitation okay\n\n\nIf it is greater than then a precipitate will form\n\n\nNow it's necessary that you put these two statements down whether\nit's greater than or it's less than alright\n\n\nYou cannot straight-away cons uh uhm conclude oh the ionic product\nis equal to a particular value that's all therefore such and such will\nprecipitate out and such and such will not precipitate out\n\n\nOkay you must give me the inequality signs here so that at least I\nknow you understand what you're working out and that you did not copy from\nsomebody else alright\n\n\nSome of you had very obvious copying uh Okay next time try to copy\nmore intelligently modify your answers slightly\n\n\nNow what's your ionic product\n\n\nOkay your ionic product might be this multiplied by this okay\n\n\nRight and all you have to do is see whether this value exceed or is\nless than the Ksp for that particular salt uhm sulphide whether it's cadmium\nmanganese iron or nickel okay\n\n\nNow in this case you probably should get uhm which one uh\n\n\nCalcium sulphide and nickel sulphide being precipitated whereas\nmanganese and uh iron is not precipitated out as a sulphide okay\n\n\nRight in question seven a you're dealing with silver chromate\n\n\nNow silver chromate uhm what you want to do is you want to form a\nsaturated solution without any of the salt precipitating out okay\n\n\nSo what is the maximum concentration of AG plus that you can have\nright\n\n\nNow how do you calculate this This means that your ionic product\nfor silver chromate must be exactly equal to Ksp\n\n\nOkay because when your ionic product is exactly equals to Ksp the\nsolution is saturated but there is no precipitate being formed alright\n\n\nSo what happens to that uhm if you write out the equilibrium you\nknow that for every one mole of silver chromate that dissociates two moles of\nH plus and one mole of chromate ion are formed alright\n\n\nSo if your solubility of sil uh silver chromate is s alright the\namount of uh AG plus formed will be two s and the amount of chromate formed\nwill be s moles per dm cube\n\n\nSo you equate the two concentrations to your Ksp you calculate for\ns you should get six point three times ten to the power minus five\n\n\nYes\n\n\nPardon\n\n\nThank you\n\n\nAlright now you go on to the next part it's not just enough to\ncalculate solubility what you want is silver ion concentration alright which\nis twice the solubility of silver chromate\n\n\nOh yes another thing uh most of you always forget to put the unit\nso I deduct half a mark each time you do that alright\n\n\nSo your silver plus concentration is that you want to express that\nin terms of grams per dm cube you multiply by the correct atomic mass okay\n\n\nYou should get zero point zero one three six gram per dm cube Again\nwatch your unit\n\n\nNow for seven b there was some confusion alright\n\n\nWhat you want to do is in this system that contains silver plus ion\nand chromate ion you want to dissolve HCL alright but you want to dissolve\nthe HCL in such a way that you have a saturated solution but no precipitate\nwill form\n\n\nNow what is this precipitate that will form\n\n\nThe precipitate will be silver chloride\n\n\nOkay because HCL will dissociate in solution to give you the ions\nalright\n\n\nSo what you have again like I always say it's soup of ion\n\n\nOkay these two will not precipitate out just saturated\n\n\nNow what you want to know is how much of this hydrochloric acid can\nI add such that these two can be present in solution and will not come up as\na solid precipitate okay\n\n\nRight\n\n\nSo most of you misunderstood the question you thought that oh it's\na completely new system I'm using a new solution that contains just silver\nchloride\n\n\nNo\n\n\nAlright you're using the same solution as in part seven a with a\nnew twist now your bubbly HCL into it alright\n\n\nOkay so how do you calculate this part the maximum amount of HCL\nthat can be added\n\n\nFirst you need to calculate the maximum chloride concentration that\ncan be dissolved alright and the only way you can do this is to equate this\nwith Ksp for a saturated solution of silver chloride\n\n\nNow where did you get this silver plus from Right silver plus from\n\n\nYour original solution containing silver and chromate and ion right\n\n\nTherefore your silver plus concentration is actually your answer to\nseven a okay\n\n\nRight\n\n\nMost of you equate oh silver plus equals chloride so you just put s\nand s so it's s square equals to Ksp and you square it your whole expression\nyou get your chloride concentration\n\n\nNo\n\n\nAlright\n\n\nThat is actually misreading the question okay\n\n\nSo your silver plus concentration you get from part seven a and\nfrom this you can calculate your chloride concentration which is a very small\nvalue uh\n\n\nRight seven point nine four times ten to the power of minus seven\nmole over dm cube Can you all see this\n\n\nYou all are speaking the answer is it Okay now for the next part\nalright uhm expressing your chloride in terms of concentration is not enough\nbecause the question asks you for the mass you know mass of HCL that can be\ndissolved in two hundred and fifty cm cube of the solution okay\n\n\nSo what you have to do is actually calculate the number of moles\nHCL that can be dissolved in two hundred and fifty cm cube alright\n\n\nNow you know that your chloride concentration is equivalent to your\nhydrochloric acid concentration\n\n\nThis is because hydrochloric acid will completely dissociate into\nions okay\n\n\nSo therefore your HCL concentration will also be the same value\nright\n\n\nAnd from there you use proportion to calculate the maximum mass of\nHCL in two hundred and fifty cm cube\n\n\nRight you just divide the answer by four and multiply by the\nmolecular mass of HCL you get a very small value okay\n\n\nOkay seven point two seven times ten to the power minus six square\nalright\n\n\nAny of you all have any questions\n\n\nYes\n\n\nYes\n\n\nNo what you're talking about is ah you're confusing number of\nmoles and concentration\n\n\nNow whether I have two hundred and fifty cm cube or or one\nthousand cm cube solution alright a saturated solution of silver chromate\nwill always have the same concentration of silver ion but the number of moles\npresent in two hundred and fifty cm cube and present in one thousand cm cube\nwill be different okay\n\n\nAlright uhm now if you see in seven a okay what is the mass of AG\nplus in one dm cube of a saturate solution of silver chromate\n\n\nAlright now that means your answer will be gram for every one dm\ncube correct\n\n\nIsn't that another way of expressing concentration gram per dm\ncube okay\n\n\nOr rather you can say concentration is actually how many moles of\nsilver plus in one dm cube\n\n\nIsn't that mole per dm cube\n\n\nThat's also AG plus concentration alright\n\n\nSo it's the number of moles in one dm cube\n\n\nYes yes\n\n\nYa oh no no no no if you read seven b ah what is the maximum mass\nof hydrogen chloride that can dissolve in two hundred and fifty cm cube of a\nsaturated solution of silver chromate saturated solution of silver chromate\nand uh for seven b and seven a also saturated solution of silver chromate\n\n\nSo in both cases seven a and seven b one is one dm cube the other\none is two hundred and fifty cm cube However both are saturated solution and\ntherefore no matter what the volume you have for solution your concentration\nof silver plus is still is still the same because both solutions are the same\nit's just that you have different volumes of them \n\n\nHowever your number of moles of silver plus will be different\nThere'll be more in the one thousand cm cube than in two hundred and fifty cm\nConcentration is different What No there is no dilution You don't transfer or\nwhat you just use the same solution and you just bubble in HCL that's all\nokay Alright Any other questions None", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "68aa6066-0a33-4e53-b6c9-53c685a5d7ea", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.534544+00:00"}
{"text": "So ancient\n\n\nAh okay okay\n\n\nSo we'll finish up the last chapter before we go on\n\n\nAnyway they are all related to soil so it's quite okay\n\n\nRight I think if I'm not mistaken did I did I finish up this with you\n\n\nI did okay\n\n\nNow I think uh this is too alright put it forward there\n\n\nThank you\n\n\nPut it down\n\n\nOkay we borrowed from the other class\n\n\nAlright uhm did I show you the vertical section of uh <unclear> word\n</unclear> soil\n\n\nNow we have been talking about the different soil type okay so in\nagriculture we actually make use of certain part of the soil that is the top\nsoil for our plants which we harvest after a few weeks' time okay like\nvegetables for example alright\n\n\nWe grow them because the roots are not deep-seated so they occupy the\ntop soil level\n\n\nNow plants which grow in the soil for I mean the roots uh uh\npenetrate the soil deeper will penetrate to the subsoil level uh which uh as\nwe know not very fertile\n\n\nYa okay and then of course most soil will not be able to reach the\nbed-rock level\n\n\nSo most of the time we are making use of the top soil\n\n\nRight tying your hair now is it\n\n\nNow this one its its experiment uhm we did is this ah something like\nthat ya\n\n\nUhm this is to show you which level is occupied by what\n\n\nThe lower levels would be stones then we have large particles then\nsmall particles silt very small particles clay human and living material\nright\n\n\nSo the top part okay\n\n\nThis is when we get a soil sample and then you put in water alright\n\n\nAnd this last one here shows you the interactions that happen in soil\nalright you have got this\n\n\nOkay let's start from the <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nOkay let's start from the left hand side rain water gets into the\nsoil\n\n\nUhm we have plants which has group nodules so we have these nodules\nwhich can take nitrogen from the air alright\n\n\nThe rain water drained away by gravity\n\n\nSome of these water are absorbed is absorbed by the plant alright\ntaken up by the plant\n\n\nAt the same time you have nitrates which is due uhm done by micro\n<unclear> word </unclear> bacteria and all these it contributes nitrate to\nthe soil\n\n\nThese nitrates will be taken up by the plants okay\n\n\nOthers will leach off alright\n\n\nThen you have when the the uhm leaves fall and they decay after they\nhave died so the bacteria and fungi will uh act on them decompose them and\ncontribute nitrates to the soil\n\n\nOf course we also have earthworm and other organism which are macro\nright in the soil which would uh contribute to the fertility of the soil by\nuh when they fall around they actually create uh what do you call that they\naerate the soil okay\n\n\nSo others we have mentioned before uh\n\n\nAlright so this is the uh what is actually happening in the soil\nright\n\n\nOkay okay\n\n\nRight then we have a summary of the properties of sand and clay right\n\n\nNow property texture okay particle size sorry sand you have large\nparticle size whereas clay very small texture sand coarse texture soil is\nlight and easy to work\n\n\nYou have you have handled soil yesterday uh sand yesterday right\n\n\nThe difference between soil and clay and sand\n\n\nYou can actually tell the difference\n\n\nRoot penetration is easy but root support is poor because they are\nuhm uhm it's it does not hold the root tightly okay\n\n\nAnd for clay it's very fine heavy difficult to work\n\n\nRoot penetration is difficult but root support is good\n\n\nIt's difficult for the root to penetrate but to support the root the\nclay soil is actually the best alright\n\n\nUhm air content uh for sand it's high large air spaces among the\nparticles whereas for clay it's low small closely adhering particles okay\n\n\nPorosity very porous water draining off readily whereas it's the\nopposite here\n\n\nAnd you have water-retaining capacity\n\n\nFor sand it's uh very poor the soil tends to be dry and over here\ngood but easily water-logged that means the water stay in there alright\n\n\nAnd the rest with capillarity we have done this\n\n\nMineral salts content for sand low as soluble salts are readily\ndrained away because they they allow water to drain off readily alright\n\n\nAnd for clay it's high since salts are not draining off alright\n\n\nSo if you are a plant uhm and you are found in areas where you can\nonly find sand and you want to germinate uhm such plants would need to have\nspecial adaptional features like for example sandy soil\n\n\nIf you are growing near the beach alright then you need to have\nfeatures which will enable you to stand upright as well as uh absorb\nnutrients okay\n\n\nSo uhm do you know which plants are found in sandy soil\n\n\nCactus\n\n\nIn sandy soil is it\n\n\nDesert okay\n\n\nAlright\n\n\nAre there any but cactus is because they do not need as much water\nthey they store the leaves\n\n\nYa okay okay\n\n\nWhat about uh coconut yes coconut what what others\n\n\nCasuarina okay\n\n\nThe casuarina casuarina has a very specific uhm root system in the\nsense that it's very deep-rooted alright and it can uhm uh anchor very well\n\n\nThat's why you see casuarina tree is actually uite big and could\nsurvive uh beach condition okay\n\n\nSo uh clay soil will be you must be able to you know penetrate and\nuhm after that it's okay for you but in terms of getting water it'll be a bit\ndifficult alright\n\n\nOkay and also you must be able to uhm survive in the area if let's\nsay it's water-logged your root system must be good enough such that it will\nnot rot okay or you do not need as much aeration in your root system alright\n\n\nSo that's the adaptation okay\n\n\nAny uestion\n\n\nNo\n\n\nThen we go on to soil fertility This the last part uh after this\nwe'll be going on to new chapter\n\n\nAlright soil fertility\n\n\nI think you have this set of notes right\n\n\nIf you want to take down points next to your notes please do so\n\n\nMost of you did not bring your notes\n\n\nAlright soil fertility depends on soil composition The composition of\nclay and sand is important\n\n\nIf you are in the if you are growing in the region or rather if you\nare a plant you grow in the region where there is only clay it's very bad\nonly sand is very bad\n\n\nYou will be very lucky if you can find a place where you have good\nsoil and then germinate and grow\n\n\nUhm that is the reason why dispersal of seed is very important\n\n\nIf the if if you make use of a very good dispersal mechanism ah then\nyou'll land in a good place and you will sprout there okay\n\n\nSo uhm most of the time plants will produce lots of seed so that just\nin case you know uhm only a few of them would find a good place to germinate\nalright and a lot of time also the seeds are able to uhm remain dormant that\nis they do not germinate at all if they are uh blown to a place whereby the\ncondition is not right\n\n\nSo they will just stay there dormant and hope that another gust of\nwind or animal or whatever will bring them to somewhere else to germinate\nokay\n\n\nSo soil condition is very very important to plants alright\n\n\nSo the soil should be well-aerated can retain some water so that uh\nleaching will not remove the soluble salts alright\n\n\nUhm fertility of the soil depends on pH If it is the soil is acidic\nthen usually it's infertile because acidity makes the mineral salts very\nsoluble alright and therefore these mineral salts when they are soluble in\nthe water it will leach off\n\n\nSo that your soil becomes poor because all your mineral salt or most\nof the mineral salts would have been gone will have leached off okay\n\n\nUHM alkaline soils usually fertile high in mineral salts content\n\n\nBut if it is too high then the salts are insoluble and therefore\ncannot be taken up by plants\n\n\nSo again uh you have to strike a balance\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nUhm but soil fertility is usually maintained by activities of\norganisms living on or in it\n\n\nThis I've mentioned bacteria blue-ridge algae actinomycetes fungi\nprotozoa nematodes arthropods and earthworms alright\n\n\nFertility is lost in agriculture alright\n\n\nNatural cycles interrupted\n\n\nIf you if you uh use a piece of land for agriculture you do not allow\nthe natural cycle to occur you see because you are ploughing you're using the\nland for your own purpose alright\n\n\nSo you are interrupting the natural cycle okay and therefore crops\nremoved and not left to decay\n\n\nBecause what you want is harvest so you remove your crops In actual\nnatural situation is the <unclear> word </unclear> will be allowed to\ndecompose and so on after they have gone through a cycle\n\n\nBut if it is an <unclear> word </unclear> piece of land then that is\nnot possible and so you are disrupting nature okay\n\n\nNutrients are not returned to soil because it is through\ndecomposition that nutrients enter the soil alright\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nTypes of soil\n\n\nWe have uh different types of soil for different purposes okay\n\n\nSedentary soil okay situated on top of rock from which it is\ndeveloped by weathering\n\n\nRemember when we did soil we said that uhm soil is obtained when we\nthrough weathering of rock and so on\n\n\nSo this the most or rather im immediate supply will be when rocks\nbecome weathered down by uh the different rain sun and all this type okay so\nyou get sedentary soil alluvial soil will be composed of mineral particles\nwhich have been carried long distances from their place of origin through\nvalley bottom and coastal plain and usually this is through by this is by\nwhat\n\n\nHow how are these soil transported\n\n\nAh\n\n\nAgain water rain natural elements okay natural elements wind and so\non okay\n\n\nAlright Topsoil and subsoil okay are with the top type of soil\n\n\nYou have loam soil yesterday we give we we we did not have a chance\nto do loam soil but we had what uh what soil as you know in garden soil okay\nthat is uh after it has been treated uh okay\n\n\nLoam soil is supposed to be more fertile\n\n\nUhm I told you before long ago in agricultural land like in in\ndifferent part of Singapore where there are Kampong areas right\n\n\nI told you that right\n\n\nHow people get loam soil okay\n\n\nRemember or not\n\n\nNo I didn't tell you\n\n\nOkay uhm usually long ago let's say long ago means less than fifteen\nyears ago or twenty years ago\n\n\nOkay we have got uh small corners around Singapore where we have\nKampong and people living in kampong they have small uh pieces of land where\nthey grow their vegetables okay\n\n\nSo it's like self-sufficient alright\n\n\nNow to get the fertilizer uh they normally do not use natural ferti\nuh artificial fertilizer that they they do not put fertilizer on into the\nsoil\n\n\nSo what they do is uh waste like uh paper decomposing leaves and so\non they will collect that alright and pile up in a heap and uh they will sun\nthese you know uh turn them over and sun and dry\n\n\nThe after a few weeks they will light a match burn them\n\n\nSo to you it might be environmental pollution but the effect is\nactually good because after burning these down become ashes and so on in a\nbig pile okay\n\n\nSo a lot of carbon uh nitrates and so on <unclear> word </unclear>\nthey do it they dig a hole bury these things inside alright keep them there\n\n\n\nThen after some time alright they they do turn it over and over and\nafter about two three weeks you'll find that the soil is become actual uh\nsoil condition black soil okay and you'll have lots of earthworms there\n\n\nSo they take this soil and they grow their vegetables okay\n\n\nOf course there are farmers who will introduce earthworms to the\nsoil to make it you know to to help out in the aeration alright and of course\nthey also uh put dungs and so on and fertilizers okay Only in recent years do\nwe have uhm they use uh fertilizer as in tablets uh you know those round\nstructures and so on But but these have got their disadvantages too okay\nWe'll go into that later alright",

{"text": "Can see or not\n\n\nClear or not\n\n\nI'm nervous you know \n\n\nOkay\n\n\nAh let me introduce you to this pretty lady here\n\n\nAlright she's a good friend of mine\n\n\nHer name is Brenda Koh\n\n\nShe's doing a some kind of a research on the kind of English I use\n\n\nRight she's from NUS okay\n\n\nWhat I say you no say\n\n\nOkay look at the diagram on the board\n\n\nAlright\n\n\nNow I'm trying to make it easier for you hopefully\n\n\nYa\n\n\nFrom what I lecture on Wednesday you may not understand\n\n\nLet's look at it\n\n\nIf I put a battery and I connect it directly to a n-type material\nwhat happens\n\n\nIs there a current\n\n\nWho say there's a current\n\n\nPut up your hand\n\n\nOne two three four five\n\n\nWho said there's a current\n\n\nYou all don't know\n\n\nI put up my hand means have lah\n\n\nYou all never put up your hands alright\n\n\nThere is a current\n\n\nWhat is the nature of the current\n\n\nInfinity\n\n\nWhat is the measure of the current\n\n\nMicro m\n\n\nHow do you know micro m\n\n\nCurrent equals to voltage divide by resistance alright\n\n\nThe value of the current depends on the voltage and the resistance of\nthis material alright\n\n\nWhat is the resistance of the material\n\n\nZero\n\n\nWhat's the resistance of material\n\n\nN-type material\n\n\nDon't know\n\n\nDon't know ah\n\n\nKnow or not\n\n\nKnow or not\n\n\nAny material right\n\n\nResistance equals to rho l over A alright\n\n\nSo sectional area is proportional inversely proportional to the\nresistance alright\n\n\nNow so what happens\n\n\nIf I increase the voltage what happen to my current\n\n\nIncrease or decrease\n\n\nIncrease okay\n\n\nVoltage increase current will increase\n\n\nNow what happen if I change this guy\n\n\nAlright I said I want to use the n-type material but I want a\nnarrower strip\n\n\nWhat happen to the current\n\n\nIncrease or decrease\n\n\nCurrent decrease right\n\n\nAlright area is smaller resistance is bigger current will drop okay\n\n\nSo far so good\n\n\nSo far so good\n\n\nOkay good\n\n\nNow your JFET has got one n-type material and two p-type material\nthere correct\n\n\nOkay let's say I put a voltage what happen\n\n\nThis junction here what kind of biasing\n\n\nReverse bias\n\n\nThis junction\n\n\nReverse bias right\n\n\nReverse bias alright\n\n\nNow if it's reverse bias what happen to the depletion region\n\n\nIncrease or decrease\n\n\nDepletion region widens alright so depletion region increase what\nhappen to my channel\n\n\nMy area here\n\n\nHow much\n\n\nSmaller area right\n\n\nSmaller area\n\n\nIf I increase my voltage what happen\n\n\nThe current bigger but my channel is smaller\n\n\nCurrent smaller right\n\n\nSo my current will go bigger but it will not go as much as if there\nis no p-type material there alright\n\n\nSo if you draw a graph alright or if I take the junction here uh VDS\nand I draw a graph if this the diagram then as my voltage increases my\ncurrent will increase <unclear> word </unclear> alright\n\n\nBut if I put in this p material in between what happen is instead of\ngoing all the way there'll come a point where it will change in the rate of\nincrease alright\n\n\nSo it will start <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nAlright the increase will become smaller and smaller and smaller\nuntil a point where the depletion region touches one another it will stop\n\n\nOnce there's the this depletion region is <unclear> word </unclear>\nformed there is no current alright\n\n\nSo the current will remain constant\n\n\nThis the case where we say it's equal to IDSS remember\n\n\nAlright now when the depletion region is formed the current becomes\nconstant\n\n\nWhy why\n\n\nIt's supposed depletion region means no current what how come current\nis constant\n\n\nWhat\n\n\nSaturated saturated alright\n\n\nNow in your logical mind once it's reverse bias no current can go\nthrough isn't it\n\n\nAlright no current can go through which is true\n\n\nAlright just that the current can only go through the channel\n\n\nSo once the channel is closed no current can go through alright but\nwe say that this one stays at the saturation level because what happens is\nthe depletion region no current go through and no current go through the\ndepletion region will shrink\n\n\nOnce it shrink the channel is opened current will go again alright\n\n\nWhen current flow again the depletion grow again\n\n\nSo it's a continuous process alright and as it goes on the current\nstays at that point\n\n\nAlright we call this the saturation current for the JFET\n\n\nCan or not\n\n\nOkay now next thing\n\n\nI'm going to make it more complicated ah\n\n\nCan I let's say I don't consider this voltage\n\n\nPut in a voltage here alright\n\n\nPut in available voltage here what happen\n\n\nAlright in our diagram we call this VGG what happen to the junction\n\n\nForward or reverse bias\n\n\nWho said forward bias\n\n\nNobody said forward bias\n\n\nKok Fai\n\n\nOkay reverse bias right\n\n\nBoth junctions are reverse bias okay\n\n\nNow both under reverse bias what happen\n\n\nSame thing\n\n\nDepletion region will grow right Depending on how big this voltage\nis that it will correspond to the growth of your depletion region okay\n\n\nSo it can grow a little bit here and a little bit here\n\n\nIf it grows like that you'll still have a channel you can pass your\ncurrent through alright until a point where if you increase this very high\nthese two will meet and these two meet there's no more channel\n\n\nNo channel no current alright\n\n\nSo these are the various conditions that we have in the JFET\n\n\nWe have a case where VGS equals zero alright when we disconnect this\nguy and put this to ground\n\n\nAlright that's the first case where we get this from this diagram\n\n\nThen as we increase VGG you get a smaller channel and as you\nincrease your VDD on this side the channel becomes smaller and smaller again\n\n\nAlright but just now the time taken before it reaches saturation is\nfaster because the channel is already smaller when we first started alright\n\n\nSo you'll you will get a value that is smaller alright ID will\nsaturate at a value lower than IDSS alright\n\n\nAnd then at the point where VGG equals to your pinch down voltagea\nthen it will join together and your ID equals to zero all the time alright\nthen you get a case where you call this the pinch down phase ID equals to\nzero\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\nYes\n\n\nUnderstood understood ah\n\n\nYes Mr Eddy\n\n\nDo you know what you are asking or not\n\n\nCome come come come ask ask\n\n\nCan you all hear or not\n\n\nLouder lah come on\n\n\nThe mike cannot hear hurry up louder\n\n\nOkay how come there's a reverse bias to the p and the n\n\n\nLet's say I don't have this uh okay\n\n\nThat's what you mean right\n\n\nThat's what Eddy\n\n\nThis one is to ground is it\n\n\nHave to connect to ground what\n\n\nDon't connect to ground how\n\n\nMust have got return path what\n\n\nAlright just now I draw I don't put the ground because put the\nground confuse people what\n\n\nSupposed to have the ground An question answered right\n\n\nOkay any more or not\n\n\nCan understand\n\n\nOkay once you understand we can go on\n\n\nCommon-Source\n\n\nForward Transconductance very chim term but actually don't worry\nabout the definition alright\n\n\nIt sounds very long doesn't matter all you need to remember is this\nformula okay\n\n\nThis guy equals to this\n\n\nThat's what it means alright\n\n\nAh I told you before engineers define things by equations so here we\ndefine Gm as a common-source forward transconductance as change in ID over\nchange in VDS for constant value or for a value of VDS equals to zero that\nmeans to shock the you shock the drain source voltage alright\n\n\nThis is current divide by voltage which is a conductance\n\n\nAlright conductance is measured in <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nAlright typical values from one to ten <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nNow this this parameter can be found in your datasheets as per all\nthe other alright same as all the rest\n\n\nOkay this one is Mathematics alright\n\n\nThis equation we know uh ID equals to IDSS into one minus VGS over\nVP square\n\n\nGm equals to this alright\n\n\nDifferentiate okay\n\n\nYou all Mathematicians differentiate this ID with respect to VGS\nalright\n\n\nSo VGS is your variable that you differentiate with respect to\nalright the differentiation\n\n\nTake down the two so you get two IDSS equal VP alright\n\n\nPut down the whatever inside here alright\n\n\nDifferentiate here <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nOutside alright\n\n\nI hope I integrated or differentiated properly alright\n\n\nThen I don't want a negative sign so I put it inside here okay\n\n\nMathematics is sound nuh\n\n\nMy Maths okay uh\n\n\nNow this value two IDSS divide by VP we give it another parameter\nname we call this Gm0 alright\n\n\nGm nought\n\n\nGm nought equals to this so that Gm equals to this one\n\n\nIt's easy to remember easier to remember\n\n\nNow this Gm nought is defined as the maximum ac gain parameter of\nserving an a bias of VGS equals to zero\n\n\nWell that's a definition of Gm zero\n\n\nNow what you need to know is alright what you need to know is these\nformulas alright these two\n\n\nThat's all you need to know alright\n\n\nNow the other characteristics that you can find in a JFET is found\nin your datasheet is this drain source on resistance\n\n\nWhen when the drain source is on alright when you use as a switch\nyou have it on off alright\n\n\nSo on resistance is when the switch is on okay\n\n\nWhat is the value of the resistance at the drain to the source that\nis what you measure alright and it ranges from ten to few hundred ohm\n\n\nThis is another parameter that you can you need to know how to\ndefine okay\n\n\nWhat's the time now\n\n\nOkay the time is thirty\n\n\nI can go on\n\n\nHave I finished two thousand words\n\n\nNot yet ah\n\n\nI no voice already\n\n\nActually I plan to stop here one you know but I haven't reached two\nthousand words so I must carry on alright\n\n\nOkay never mind it's very fast alright\n\n\nThe next topic is another kind of STP we call this the metal oxide\nsemiconductor FET alright in short we call this MOSFET M-O-S VP MOSFET\nalright\n\n\nNow MOSFET is the way it functions is something like JFET with a\nlittle bit of difference alright and it's constructed with a gate terminal\ninsulated from the channel that means instead of well my gate is these two\n\n\nInstead of the two gates connected directly to the channel I use an\ninsulator to insulate it alright\n\n\nThat's what it does right and the insulating material is called\nsilicon dioxide that's the materials\n\n\nAlright and there are two types of MOSFET one is called the\ndepletion MOSFET and it works very much like the JFET and then the other one\nis called the enlargement MOSFET which works almost entirely differently\nalright\n\n\nDepletion MOSFET now this diagram can be found in your book uh\n\n\nThe transparency not clear you can book\n\n\nOkay I have again the drain and the source alright\n\n\nThe these are the n-type regions okay\n\n\nThe drain and the source is connected to the n-type the n channel\nalright the gate is connected to the p-substrate <unclear> word </unclear>\nthe p-type\n\n\nSo it forms something like this the same thing alright\n\n\nSo you find that here there's a channel on this side p alright the n\nis this one p surrounding all over the all over\n\n\nBut this is just a sectional view\n\n\nIt's not the it's not it's a piece <unclear> word </unclear> imagine\na piece of block alright it's inside with the p-sucstrate all over alright\nsurrounding it not just what you see alright the p-substrate is surrounding\nit\n\n\nSo the same thing applies alright p-type substrate n-type channel\nokay\n\n\nNow the symbol is this one alright\n\n\nThis a symbol for the depletion MOSFET source drain A alright and\nthe arrow pointing inwards is what you call the p-substrate alright \n\n\nIf the substrate is n then the arrow pointing outwards Alright I'll\nshow you the graph afterwards okay n channel is physically constructed and\nembedded in the struc in the in the substance alright Basically what I what I\ndo okay I make a piece of n n-type and then I have the p-type I'll just\nsqueeze it in something like that That's what it means okay How to do it so\nif when go for a <unclear> word </unclear> factory visit uh go and find out\nThe current will flow between the drain and the source of the voltage\nconnected across drain and source same thing as uh that one alright I connect\nit here from here to here I'll get a current going like that alright So this\nmy my <unclear> word </unclear> connect to the n channel it will flow like\nthat alright go across the channel okay How come not the other way\nConventional current flow is like that electron flow is like that okay It's\nhow I it's how you put in your voltage source alright Now you put in the the\nsame thing applies there right the same kind of uh phenomenon that means if I\nif I put in the voltage the current will flow As the current flow the\ndepletion region form and so on alright Then the current saturate The same\nthe same thing happens okay", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "b5b56dc6-2707-4532-b7f5-af22a25089fd", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.536486+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nFolks say Hi to Brenda\n\n<$B> \n\nHi\n\n<$A> \n\nBrenda is from NUS and doing Linguistics right\n\n<$C> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nYa and she's working on a project and so wants to record the uh\nlesson that I'm going to be giving today\n\n<$D> \n\nIs she observing us or you\n\n<$A> \n\nUh no she's really not observing so much as just recording and\nthen going back to analyse it right\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nNow what we're going to do today is a exercise in multi-track\nrecording okay and specifically you'll be trying to record this commercial\n\n\nOkay I don't have enough copies\n\n\nFour of you'll have to share\n\n\nWait Mike\n\n\nSorry I think you better join the other group 'cos I need two guys\nin a group\n\n\nOkay pretty tacky commercial right\n\n\nOkay nonetheless we'll this is what we're going to try to do\n\n\nNow this is not an assignment in writing a good commercial or\nproducing a commercial\n\n\nIt's an exercise in multi-track production okay and for the\npurposes of actually putting together some program we're going to put\ntogether a commercial okay\n\n\nAnd the commercial is written with too many things in mind\n\n\nUh it's a wrong way to write it okay\n\n\nI wanted to have music\n\n\nI wanted to have sound effects of a crowd and a few other things\nand I wanted to make sure that most of them were girls because we we didn't\nhave enough guys in the class\n\n\nOkay that's not the way to write a commercial\n\n\nOkay you normally identify objectives and write it from there\ninstead of the other way around\n\n\nSo this is what we'll be doing uh doing it through multi-track\nrecording okay\n\n\nNow the way that you're familiar with up to now is you combine two\nelements okay two audio sources on the console you record it onto a tape and\nthen if you need to combine even more you use that tape as a source and\ncombine a new element and then if you need to combine more you take that one\nand combine another one okay\n\n\nIt could work that's a valid way of doing things\n\n\nThe problem is if you handed in the tape to me at the very end and\nI said okay I think this's a good commercial right but I wish the music was\nlouder over here or softer over here there's not much you can do because\nthey've all already been combined\n\n\nYou understand what I'm saying\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nWith the multi-track method what we'll actually do is we will\nrecord each element separately on a different track okay and we'll record\neach one at peak that means you're not uh fading or doing any any of that\nstuff yet\n\n\nWe'll just going to record all of them at peak and then we'll sit\ndown later on after all the elements have been recorded and we'll do the\nfinal mix\n\n\nThat's when we all sit down and set all the levels and we we record\nit onto a two-track tape and then we listen to it and say well okay I think\nat this point the music needs to be louder or softer\n\n\nAt this point the conversation is drowned by uh sorry the dialogue\nis drowned by the conversation at the background so we need to do something\n\n\nThen you can just do it again and make those adjustments\n\n\nOkay so multi-track uh recordings are more flexible in in that way\nokay\n\n\nNow all tapes that go for broadcast all final master tapes will be\non two tracks okay so you will not actually submit that the multi-track\nrecording uhm as a final program\n\n\nOkay that multi-track recording must be mixed down onto a two-track\ntape okay\n\n\nUhm tell Emily that she should be <unclear> word </unclear> in the\nother room\n\n\nUh\n\n\nAh with Mike\n\n\nOkay what I want you to do is take a look at the script and try to\nidentify the elements that they have okay\n\n\nAnd wait first we have sound effects right\n\n\nUh which one\n\n\nOkay the uh we take it at a time\n\n\nConversation\n\n\nOkay anything else\n\n\nWhat else\n\n\nOkay with more sound effects okay\n\n\nThe the can popping okay etceteras\n\n\nNow strictly speaking the can popping and the drink being poured\ninto a glass would be separate sound effects that you would have to combine\nin making the commercial\n\n\nBut to simplify matters I've already combined them for you so that\none follows the other then you can use it just like that\n\n\nSo for the purposes of this exercise we count it as just one sound\neffect\n\n\nUh what else\n\n\nOkay good\n\n\nAnd then\n\n\nAnd then we have voices right\n\n\nAnd we have more than one voice we'll treat each one of them as a\nseparate element\n\n\nSo who do we have\n\n\nWe have Jenny right\n\n\nWe have Jenny Carol we have the announcer and the guy with no name\nokay\n\n\nSo we have seven elements in a simple thirty-second commercial\n\n\nOkay so it's not as easy as you think it might be\n\n\nNow we need to record all of them separately and so let's take a\nlook at the elements and figure out how many tracks you would actually need\nto record on\n\n\nOkay it is not seven it's going to be more than seven\n\n\nThe reason is because music always comes from left right down right\n\n\nIt's in stereo\n\n\nOkay so we would we would need uh two tracks to record the music\n\n\nSound effects also in stereo so you need two over here two over\nhere okay and the rest of them are voices not in stereo they're recorded in\nmono so you need one track each\n\n\nOkay so that's one and ten right\n\n\nSo we would need a ten-track recorder to be able to record this\ncommercial\n\n\nNow there really is no such thing as a ten-track recorder\n\n\nOkay they come in variables of two four eight sixteen twenty-four\nfirst okay then thirty-two thirty-six right\n\n\nSo for our commercial we would need which one of those\n\n\nSixteen okay we'll need a sixteen-track recorder\n\n\nDo you see any around\n\n\nDo you\n\n\nOkay we don't have a sixteen-track recorder\n\n\nOkay so strictly speaking if you're a professional trying to record\nthis commercial you would need at least a sixteen-track recorder\n\n\nWhat we're going to do today is to improvise a little bit okay\n\n\nWe're actually going to do some combining of elements in recording\nsome elements uh on one track\n\n\nSo what we'll do is first uhm we would record the music on one\nchannel so it'll no longer be in stereo it'll be in mono okay\n\n\nAnd we'll do the same for the sound effects and the other sound\neffect and we will record all of the four voices on one channel okay\n\n\nAnd we need a four-track recorder and do we have four-track\nrecorder\n\n\nYes we do\n\n\nOver here\n\n\nSo we'll actually use the four-track recorder and we'll improvise a\nlittle bit\n\n\nOkay the commercial will not be in stereo but for the purposes of\nwhat we're trying to do today to do a multi-track recording that should be\nsufficient okay\n\n\nAnd after this lesson you should be able to choose whether you want\nto adopt that kind of recording for putting your final projects together or\nif you want to if you want to do it the old way that you're familiar with\nmixing and re-mixing and re-mixing okay\n\n\nGood\n\n\nNow before we actually get started let me play back some of the\nelements\n\n\nI've got on uhm the CD No <unclear> word </unclear> switch on the\nmain <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nOkay track fifty-two on this has either the the music or the sound\neffect\n\n\nLet's see which one\n\n\nNow uhm when you're looking for sound effects on a sound effect\nlibrary or sound effect disk you may find ten fifteen different uh say party\nconversation each one slightly different okay\n\n\nEven for something as simple as a car braking screeching to a halt\nthere could be ten different ones because some of them take a long time to\nscreech to a halt some of them stop immediately so they'll all come in uh\ndifferent lengths\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nSo you have to choose appropriately\n\n\nSometimes you may find there isn't really one that you can adopt\nfor your commercial\n\n\nIn that case you actually have to go out and do the recording\nyourself\n\n\nNow this party will do for this purpose but really it's it\ncomprises of Caucasians speaking\n\n\nIt's not like an Asian crowd right\n\n\nAnd uh at the party we want music that's playing in the background\nthat we can mix together with the conversation to create that the whole\neffect\n\n\nOkay on track forty-four on this one we have the\n\n\nOkay with the music it would be better okay\n\n\nSo play together it would sound\n\n\nOkay so with music in the background playing on and then we'll and\nthen we'll mix more elements between the uh dialogue between the people\ninvolved\n\n\nOkay not to mention the\n\n\nAnd on the open reel I have already mixed for you the <unclear>\nword </unclear>\n\n\nI think uh it's being played back at the wrong speed\n\n\nYa\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nSo that's the sound of of a can of Norbecker punch being opened\nand poured into a glass\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nSo you're you're familiar with all the elements that we're going\nto be using it's all there available <unclear> word </unclear> to put the\n<unclear> word </unclear> together\n\n\nNow what are the things you will notice when you're actually uh\nget the talent in front of the microphones doing the actual recording is that\nwhen the conversation takes place cold without any of the sound effects and\nthe ambien uh the ambience of the party it would sound very strange\n\n\nIt could even sound pretty tacky okay\n\n\nCould you find that it gets a bit uh better when you mix it with\nthe ambience\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nAnd it would be the same for the sound effect of the can popping\nit may seem unusual it may seem too obvious too loud okay\n\n\nBut next to everything it'll also get better\n\n\nAny questions\n\n\nOkay if no questions then you better get started putting the thing\ntogether because you don't have very much time\n\n\nSince we only have two guys we're going to have a problem deciding\nuhm who's going to be the announcer and the guy I think it'll be a good idea\nto have a guy to be announcer alright because we have already two female\nvoices and we don't want to have too many voices that sound alike okay\n\n\nSo I think uhm David would sound pretty good with the announcer\n\n\nOkay and Robin of course would be the guy\n\n\nAnd uh that's incredible I actually have names\n\n\nOkay very good\n\n\nSo Jenny will be Jenny and okay\n\n\nNow initially we don't really need you in front of the microphone\nokay\n\n\nLet's try and figure out in what order we should uh put the\ncommercial together\n\n\nWhat's the first thing you would do\n\n\nYou know you start recording the elements one by one right\n\n\nOkay which one will be the first one to record\n\n\nOkay uh track one what will it be\n\n\nOkay the okay the sound effects of the conversation and how long\nwill you record that\n\n\nYa okay very good so we'll record for more than thirty seconds uh\nbecause we don't really know the commercial will be exactly thirty seconds so\nwe can record more and during the final mix <unclear> word </unclear> we can\nactually get it out and off okay\n\n\nSo we'll record about uh say forty seconds okay\n\n\nSo we'll do that and then the next thing the music\n\n\nOkay since those two actually last from the beginning till the end\nthose are the first two that we'll do\n\n\nOkay so on track two we record the music\n\n\nAgain for forty seconds right\n\n\nAnd on track three the voices okay\n\n\nNow you'll notice that before the sound effect of the can comes up\nthe dialogue is actually interrupted right \n\n\nThe dialogue is divided into two parts\n\n\nt and one after the sound effect\n\n\nSo on track three we'll record the dialogue and up till the point\nwhen we hear the sound effect Okay and then on track four we'll record the\nsound effect and then we come back to track three and finish recording the\ndialogue\n\n\nOkay then we'll sit down and mix the final commercial together\nokay\n\n\nNow you're familiar with how the two-track machine works but you\nhaven't used the four-track recorder yet okay\n\n\nSo if you'll gather around here let me demonstrate a few things\nthat you should keep in mind\n\n\nThe four-track recorder is pretty much similar to the two-track\nrecorder except that you can record <unclear> word </unclear> I mean the\nfunctions are more or less the same\n\n\nTo be able to record you want to put it on input\n\n\nTo be able to play back you play it on <unclear> word </unclear>\nYou have both control select <unclear> word </unclear> over here <unclear>\nword </unclear> So if you want to record music and the conversation on track\none you push one down and leave the others up It will not record on the\nothers Okay when you finish doing the recording it already <unclear> word\n</unclear> track two Pretty straightforward right Okay uhm just like on the\ntwo-track machine you have output and input controls If you put it on input\nyou'll be able to actually manipulate the recording levels by using the input\nNow okay Now you'll notice on the input there's a <unclear> word </unclear>\nover here that says C-A-L Cal okay And it's actually indented so it'll\nactually stop there unless you you put it out of there and <unclear> word\n</unclear> Now that is the calibrated setting At that setting it will give\nyou pretty good sound You can basically control the levels on the console You\ncan forget about it But with usage over time if it hasn't been maintained and\nrecalibrated uh it will lose its calibration okay So always worth keeping an\neye on it just to make sure that things are going okay right But as I said\nnine nine percent of the time you put it on Cal control the levels on the\nconsole you should be able to get pretty good recording alright So that part\nis pretty simple Now there's a control here that says Synch that you haven't\nused up till now and you would be using it for this uh production The way you\nuse it is input is to record <unclear> word </unclear> is to play back If you\nput it on synch it can do both Okay say that you've recorded on track one the\nconversation and until the sound effect comes about and then you want to\nrecord the sound effect immediately there okay so you would want to listen to\nthe conversation so that you know exactly when to cue in the sound effect\nright Okay so you want to listen to track one but record on track two That's\nwhat you you use synch for You understand Okay well uh if you don't you will\nwhen we actually do the recording okay Right any questions Okay if there are\nno questions then let's get started Uh <unclear> word </unclear> you'll\nactually produce okay Of course with the assistance of uh the rest of the\ngang right Your job is to tell them what to do okay so let's get started", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f9961200-9883-47f6-8d68-e0acb97fc868", "added":

{"text": "<$A>\n\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> introduce you to uh Mrs Lee\n\n\nShe's a friend of mine from NUS okay and she's going to record this lesson\n\n\nDon't worry\n\n\nIt's my <unclear> word </unclear> it's my uhm voice that she wants not\nso much for <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nYou after that terrible piece of work you have dare say anything else\n\n\nUhm right have you all got your papers back\n\n\nUhm sit down quick\n\n\nYes\n\n\nOkay can I get the lesson going\n\n\nDanny alright\n\n\nOkay now uhm as you can see from your grades it was not very good\n\n\nI don't know why\n\n\nNo it's upon fifteen\n\n\nDream on\n\n\nOkay now have you got your passage with you\n\n\nRight I think one thing which you all forgot to do was to read the\nquestion carefully\n\n\nOkay read question <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nThe Indians said the fish danced on the beaches at full moon\n\n\nExplain clearly by using your own words what was actually happening\nand why it only happened when the moon was full\n\n\nWere the fish dancing\n\n\nDid they go one two three one two three\n\n\nNo then why didn't you say so\n\n\nIs it\n\n\nIs it understood\n\n\nNo it's not that's why they asked you the question in the first place\n\n\nSo one of the basic things when you have to state okay\n\n\nSorry this OHP is not very clear\n\n\nUhm the first thing you should point out is that it's not true that\nthe fish were actually dancing on the beach\n\n\nYou don't state that you have not answered the question at all and\nthat is why most of you ended up with out of four marks I gave you one and a\nhalf because you didn't answer the question alright\n\n\nBut you have to tell them I mean they are assuming that I mean the\nIndians say it's one thing right but you know it's not\n\n\nSo logically you have to say it's not what the Indians thought it was\n\n\nThen after that you <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nIt's four marks\n\n\nYou have to earn those four marks they're not going to give it to you\nokay\n\n\nNow carry on with it okay\n\n\nIt tells a story the female <unclear> word </unclear> came up onto\nthe beach and uhm lay the eggs in the sand okay\n\n\nBut what is important is that she laid them beyond the point where\nthe tide reaches\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nThe second half of the question asked you right\n\n\nWhat is the connection with the moon\n\n\nThat's why you got to state this point here okay\n\n\nThis point\n\n\nIt's the circular twisting motion of the fertilizing males that looks\nlike a dance\n\n\nHere you have explained what actually is happening\n\n\nWhy is it that the Indians thought the fish were dancing\n\n\nBecause the male fish are moving around the female fish\n\n\nNow if this is not there out of four marks I can't even give you two\nokay\n\n\nThe second half of the question\n\n\nWhat is the connection with the moon\n\n\nThe full moon is important because it indicates the high tides when\nthe eggs are laid\n\n\nThere are two reasons for this\n\n\nThe high tide will bring the female fish up onto the beach because\nshe lays her eggs onto the beach right\n\n\nThen after that what happens\n\n\nAfter she's laid the eggs she leaves them right\n\n\nShe doesn't uhm she doesn't sit on the eggs like say the chicken\nwould to incubate the eggs\n\n\nThe eggs are left in the sand unattended to so logically no one else\nno other fish will come up onto the beach because once the high tide point\nhas been reached subsequent tides will be lower they will be further back\n\n\nIt won't come up as high\n\n\nThe period of lower tides that follows the eggs will not be affected\nby the incoming water and can mature undisturbed\n\n\nIt will be untouched\n\n\nIt takes what nine ten days Then after that the next high tide comes\n\n\nBy that time the wa when the water reaches the high tide water mark\nthe fish will be the new fish the newly hatched fish will be ready to go to\nthe sea\n\n\nThe water will bring them back\n\n\nThat's why there is a connection with the full moon\n\n\nThey need the pull the tides gravitational pull okay\n\n\nNow you should be rephrasing your own words you should not have\ncopied gyrate incubate uh undisturbed if possible uhm rephrase it by saying\nnot affected alright\n\n\nThe other thing that I think can you please write down somewhere on\nyour answer script or on your passage the tense in which you should be\nanswering your questions in\n\n\nI did not correct every uhm error made in tense because otherwise\nyour whole answer script will be nothing but underlining of grammatical\nerrors\n\n\nWhat tense should be used when you're answering this type of question\n\n\nLeonard\n\n\nWhy past\n\n\nWhen do you use the present tense the simple present tense\n\n\nWhen do you use the present tense\n\n\nWhen do you use present tense\n\n\nObviously when the question is given in the present tense\n\n\nYou use present tense is for when something is happening now right\n\n\nBut what about facts and habitual actions\n\n\nThey are on-going happening all the time therefore present tense\nshould be used because this is something that happens in nature right\n\n\nAnd it will happen today it'll happen tomorrow it happened last year\nit will happen it will continue on for the next twenty years\n\n\nTherefore when you're answering a question like this it should be in\nthe simple present tense\n\n\nWhen you're asked to describe something that is happening in your\ntext tense should be simple present\n\n\nYou're not to use the past tense okay\n\n\nAlright let's move on to the second question\n\n\nUhm All creatures except man are locked into the environment\n\n\nExplain what this phrase tells you about creatures other than man\n\n\nIllustrate its meaning from what the passage has to say about the\nhummingbird and the butterfly using your own words as far as possible\n\n\nAlright now this phrase comes from line twenty three right\n\n\nLocked in its environment\n\n\nBut the reference to the butterflies and hummingbirds comes in line\nsixteen seventeen\n\n\nIf you are locked somewhere what's the idea there\n\n\nUhm\n\n\nYou're confined you're chained you can't move\n\n\nSo the main idea which has to be brought up is that there is a\ndependency on the environment to survive\n\n\nHe is chained to the environment\n\n\nNow how are you going to use the butterflies and the hummingbirds to\nsupport your illustration\n\n\nThe butterflies they have the ability to camouflage themselves as\nleaves or poisonous insects okay\n\n\nThe hummingbird has the ability to hover and its long-probing beak\nallows it to suck nectar from the flowers\n\n\nThat helps them survive in the environment\n\n\nBut what happens if the butterfly doesn't have the flowers any more\nto feed on\n\n\nIt's got a long sharp beak\n\n\nIs it going to be any good for picking up worms or whatever\n\n\nAssuming that it can consume worms\n\n\nNo right\n\n\nIt's only good for sucking up nectar therefore that implies it's\nonly got one source of food same thing with the uhm sorry what am I talking\nabout\n\n\nIt's the hummingbird not the butterfly okay\n\n\nThe hummingbird has only got one source of food\n\n\nNow the butterfly brightly-coloured wings\n\n\nWhat does that allow\n\n\nProtection right\n\n\nIn the environment because it's camouflaged\n\n\nBut if taken out of that particular environment it's brightly\ncoloured\n\n\nIt could be brightly coloured as if it's a flower or it could be\nvery dully coloured so that it becomes inconspicuous\n\n\nBut if you put it in another environment will it be very noticeable\nin this classroom\n\n\nYes right\n\n\nTherefore the environment provides it with its protection\n\n\nBut there is only one form of protection it doesn't have any other\nmeans of defence\n\n\nSo these adaptations limit the creatures to a specific environment\n\n\nThe birds have only source of food the butterflies have no other\nmeans of protection and that is why they are locked into that one environment\n\n\nIf there're no flowers no nectar the hummingbird hasn't got any\nother means of food okay\n\n\nNow there's one more thing which I noticed in all your scripts about\nat least half of your scripts\n\n\nNo chalk here\n\n\nAlright now listen to this sentence\n\n\nThe butterfly is a creature uhm which has many enemies\n\n\nTheir enemies are and then I give you a list\n\n\nWhat's wrong with sentence The butterfly is a creature with many\nenemies\n\n\nTheir enemies are what's wrong with it\n\n\nUhm\n\n\nWell doesn't matter\n\n\nThere's nothing wrong with that creature\n\n\nIt's a grammatical error between the two sentences\n\n\nThe first sentence was a butterfly right\n\n\nThen after that I continue it with their\n\n\nNow if you look at your sentences a lot of you make that mistake\n\n\nYou started writing off the first half of the sentence with in the\nsingular protect themselves\n\n\nIt should be protect himself\n\n\nDo you see that mistake\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nLook for consistency in your answers\n\n\nOkay uhm\n\n\nYa next one invent\n\n\nHe had to invent a pebble and a a flint\n\n\nIt could be said that invent is used incorrectly here\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nGo back to the passage and reread it right\n\n\nWhenever something is given in text go back and read exactly where\nit comes from because often the line immediately before that or after it will\ngive you an idea or a clue as to what the question is asking of you okay\n\n\nOkay so line about forty eight before that man is a puny slow\nawkward unarmed animal\n\n\nHe had to invent a pebble a flint a knife a spear\n\n\nEssential these scientific inventions essential to his survival\n\n\nWhat kind of ideas being brought up here\n\n\nHe's unarmed\n\n\nIf he's unarmed what does that mean\n\n\nHe is\n\n\nDefenceless okay\n\n\nTherefore why does he find these inventions essential\n\n\nThey're going to be used as protection weapons okay\n\n\nYou've got a knife and you've got a spear\n\n\nNow a very primitive spear\n\n\nHow did the caveman prehistoric man make the spear\n\n\nHe used a stone right\n\n\nHe sharpened the edge and then he attached it onto a stick perhaps\nand that's it\n\n\nThat's a spear\n\n\nSo that's where your connection of a pebble a flint a knife and a\nspear >\nICE-SIN:#> That's why you've got these two simple things followed on with two\ninventions You see it's a bit odd right\n\n\nNow you can invent a spear but you cannot invent a pebble\n\n\nSo you've got to bring out that idea but the first thing that you\nforgot is that invent you have to give the meaning behind it otherwise you\ncan't explain why it's incorrectly used\n\n\nState that\n\n\nTo invent is to produce or create something that did not exist\npreviously or was not in existence\n\n\nAnd then you go on and elaborate\n\n\nPeb pebbles already exist uhm nature-endowed\n\n\nGod-given whatever\n\n\nSo these two together will give you one mark\n\n\nMost of you gave me only this which will give you only half a mark\nalright\n\n\nNow Part b uh I think most of you went wrong here\n\n\nWhat does the author mean by this statement\n\n\nGoes back to what I discussed with you earlier\n\n\nWith reference to invent and what he was trying to invent okay\n\n\nThe author means to discover or invent a use for the pebble\n\n\nYou use it transform it into a weapon because man is weak\n\n\nHe doesn't have uhm he's not he doesn't have any body adaptations\nwhich offer a form of protection to him\n\n\nHe doesn't have sharp claws\n\n\nAlright he doesn't have sharp teeth okay\n\n\nAlright now I also return you your uhm exercise which you did for me\nexplaining metaphors\n\n\nSome of you in that exercise you followed the correct structure just\nas then whatever it is so\n\n\nRight remember that structure which I ask you to pay attention to\n\n\nNow what you've got are three metaphoric phrases which you've been\nasked to explain \n\n\nEven if you don't like following the structure 'just as' and 'so'\nyou should have remembered that you are supposed to explain the literal\nmeaning of metaphor first and then relate it back into the context First one\nwould be 'an animal fits into its environment just uhm like one cogwheel into\nanother' What you've got to explain is the concept of a cogwheel Right What\nis it You think of a cogwheel you think of gears you think of wheels with\nWith what What's so special about gears They've got two wheels right If I've\ngot two wheels and I put them together is that a gear Why Mhm The edges they\nare grooved serated right They've got teeth on them so that when you put the\ntwo together they interlock and the turning of one wheel will turn the other\nwheel It's this kind of principle What's going on What's the problem I want\nto finish this first then I want to use the OHP Is that a problem Okay\nexplain to me the concept of a cogwheel Explain to me Explain to me what I've\njust explained Pay attention next time uh okay Right the idea of teeth on a\nwheel okay One fitting into another interlocking So it's this idea of once\nyou've explained that here right it's this idea of the smooth inevitable\ninterlocking of creature and environment How the animal is able to adapt\nitself to suit its surroundings perfectly You explain this one first right a\ncogwheel wheel with teeth on it uhm the idea of gear one wheel turning\nanother it's it's connected they fit perfectly and then you go on and explain\nhow it is in use in the passage So this will be one mark and this one will be\none mark", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "1969bc33-c06e-496e-9937-60a44405293e",

{"text": "<$A>\n\nSo class I hope that you will be able to share with your classmates\nthose who are coming in now what I've explained to you about the sixty four\ncards and what you're supposed to do\n\n\nIt is an individual response so there are no right or wrong answer\n\n\nI'll like to begin my lecture today by telling you that we have now\ncome to the last lecture in our series on human resource management\n\n\nWe have gone a long journey\n\n\nI hope you have found it interesting\n\n\nIt was taught it was quite a number of months when I welcomed you to\nNgee Ann Polytechnic and when I welcomed you to do this Human Resource\nManagement program and we had got a few breaks in between and now dinner is\nahead\n\n\nWell it'll be nice if we can all go for dinner and celebrate but we\ncan't do that now because your exam is just ahead of you\n\n\nToday we want to deal on creativity\n\n\nWe want to deal on creative problem solving\n\n\nA couple of weeks ago you had a lecture on the rational\nproblem-solving approach today we are not doing the rational problem-solving\napproach we are doing the creative problem-solving approach and if you recall\nin our film on the ABC of decision making the conclusion was that it is\nactually very good if you can base your decision on number one\n\n\nCold hard facts and at the same time combine it with some intuition\nand individual judgement\n\n\nIn other words we cannot just simply rely on cold hard facts\n\n\nThere are some problems and particularly when they affect people we\nhave also look at it from the creative approach\n\n\nIn other words we have to look at and find some new ideas\n\n\nSo here you see two people having ideas but one of them uh sort of\ngive up and do not follow up on the idea whereas another one follows up on\nthe idea and cover up with some innovation\n\n\nSo I'm sure you realise that many of the innovations we have today\nare because someone have a good idea and was able to apply that idea and uh I\nhope that you have read through your notes on creative problem solving page\none\n\n\nI'll not go into detail about some of the definitions you should know\nfor example what is discovery\n\n\nIs discovery something already existing but unnoticed uh for example\nsomeone discovered the law of gravity\n\n\nGravity has always been there but nobody sort of discovered it or\ndidn't notice it until somebody noticed an apple falling and asked why how\ncome the apple fall like this why not fall upwards or fall sideways huh\n\n\nSo I hope that uh you would also discover many things and you would\nalso notice many things\n\n\nIt's always good to open your eyes uh\n\n\nI noticed today for example that not all students are here\n\n\nIs it correct\n\n\nI don't know where they are\n\n\nSo you know what is invention and innovation huh\n\n\nBasically invention you are doing something entirely new\n\n\nIt's a new invention like before the telephone was invented uh\n\n\nThat was really a new invention\n\n\nThere was nothing before that like that huh\n\n\nBut it can also replace something old of course and this is where\ninnovation also helps to modify or update or refine an existing product\n\n\nSo all this requires creative thinking and I'd like you to page to uh\nturn to page two where you have got uh the four mental powers\n\n\nI hope by now after reading these notes you are made aware that\nactually we have a very good brain and we have got four mental powers\n\n\nOne of them is the power to absorb to observe to sense and to be\nattentive\n\n\nI hope that you are paying me attention now or be attentive to me and\nreferring to your notes and you are absorbing through your senses now through\nyour eyes and through your ears\n\n\nYou are able to learn something that there is one mental power called\nthe absorptive power and I believe that in the past week or so you have\nabsorbed a lot of information and you have learnt a lot I hope\n\n\nAnd the second power that we have of course is a retentive power that\nmeans we not only able to absorb we are able also to retain in our mind we\ncan memorise things we can retain we can recall\n\n\nAnd it is of course very good to have a this retentive ability in all\nof us and I believe that we all does have some very good memories\n\n\nIt's a matter of uh knowing how to memorise using various tools to\nmemorise for example I have told you how you can memorise the main points\nabout why do people resist change you can't forget that any more right\n\n\nWe all don't like to have the sack to be sacked uh s-a-c and you know\nhow you can uh sort of uh make it more accepting to people where you make\nsome changes\n\n\nUse NPB and UCC\n\n\nAll these are just some tools for you to help you to retain and to\nrecall and I'm sure you can recall many things in the past especially those\nthings that you find very meaningful very interesting well of course we also\nforget quite number of things especially those things we find very boring\nthose things which are no more relevant huh unfortunately\n\n\nAnd in fact I just went to my mechanic yesterday and he recall the\nlast time I my car broke down was in the World Trade Centre\n\n\nHe could recall that he talked to me over the phone\n\n\nI was very amazed\n\n\nSo you see how uh if you can know your customers well like this uh\nit's very useful actually\n\n\nNow this is how we learn\n\n\nBut of course we do not only uh have these two mental power\n\n\nWe also can reason\n\n\nWe can also be creative and this is where I have taught you a bit\nmore about thinking and I have uh shared with you in a few lectures before on\nthe rational problem-solving approach where the main emphasis is to use\nreason the main emphasis is to analyze things to assess to evaluate to judge\nand to come to certain conclusion based on various logic or various reasons\nhuh\n\n\nThat is the rational problem-solving approach and we all can reason\n\n\nHowever there's only one mental power and we also need to now come to\nthe fourth mental power called the creative mental power that we have and\nthis is the ability in which we can generate ideas and we need to have more\nand better ideas\n\n\nWe need to be able to foresee things and we can only foresee things\nif we use our creative mental power\n\n\nWe need to able to visualize to see ahead and this visualization that\nwe have which of course has to do with our power of imagination uhm\n\n\nThey we all say that we inside our mind there's what's called a\nmind's eye\n\n\nThere's an eye there huh\n\n\nIt's just an illustration to say that we can imagine visualize we can\nfeel\n\n\nCan you imagine now getting the diploma\n\n\nCan you imagine\n\n\nYes you can imagine\n\n\nCan you imagine Mr Teo sitting in the hall clapping one by one as you\ncome up to receive your diploma\n\n\nCan you imagine\n\n\nCan you see Mr Teo\n\n\nYes you can imagine\n\n\nI can also imagine you coming up in a very nice white dress uh most\nof the students are wearing white on that day\n\n\nVery smart\n\n\nCan you imagine\n\n\nYes you can\n\n\nIt is very important for us to be able to imagine certain things and\nthis is where we come to the imagination the power of imagination\n\n\nThere is creative imagination and <unclear> word </unclear>\nimagination visual imagination and vicarious imagination\n\n\nSo you read the facts on your own\n\n\nIt says there that uh our imagination will affect our emotion because\njust now as I talked to you about graduation day you have a sense already of\nachievement of pride of happiness all my two years working here had come to\nthe fruition huh\n\n\nCan you imagine it\n\n\nYou can feel\n\n\nAffect your emotion and there the untapped power of imagination\nalmost unlimited\n\n\nWe are not tapping it enough uhm\n\n\nAccording to psychologists we only use only ten to twenty percent of\nour mental potential and uh imagine at four different parts the creative\nimagination where you try to imagine something creatively huh\n\n\nTake for example my friend or my colleague uh she did this\n\n\nI think it's very nice she just bring all these to get I can't do\nthis uh\n\n\nBut it shows that she could imagine and she could creatively that\ncreate a bouquet like this\n\n\nPut it in a nice place uh appropriate places\n\n\nAnticipative imagination\n\n\nWhat you expect you shall find\n\n\nSo what do you anticipate\n\n\nIf you can anticipate for example this question will come out that\nquestion is more important\n\n\nIt is very useful\n\n\nYou would anticipate your boss to be very angry today your boss will\nbe very nice today\n\n\nYour boss will be asking you this\n\n\nYour boss will be asking you that\n\n\nIt is very good to be able to anticipate uhm\n\n\nThe visual imagination uhm you're able to see certain things visually\n\n\nSo some of us can see better things than others huh\n\n\nWe can imagine very clearly\n\n\nWhen I talked to you about graduation day you can see not only people\nyou can see colours and so on uhm\n\n\nAt last vi vicarious uh\n\n\nThat means you can feel for others\n\n\nI imagine that when I said that to him he would have felt very happy\nor he would have felt very sad\n\n\nIf you can have a vicarious imagination it's also very useful in your\ninterpersonal relationship huh\n\n\nHow do the other party feel\n\n\nHow would he have felt\n\n\nIf I were in his shoe how would I have felt or how would he have\nfelt huh\n\n\nSo all these things I hope you would see it to be of value to you\nand we go on to the how does the mind therefore develop a new thought\n\n\nPage three\n\n\nAre you following me on page three uhm\n\n\nThis's also a very interesting uh thing because it tells you that\nour mind works in a progressive manner and first of all we must sense or we\nmust recognize that there is a problem\n\n\nIf we don't recognize of course we don't we can't uh proceed and so\nthere are two aspect of it\n\n\nOne is to be able to detect the problem and the other one is to able\nto find a new approach to the problem\n\n\nSo actually what is the problem\n\n\nProblem definition here and to approach it from a different angle\nhuh\n\n\nNext preparation\n\n\nYou have to prepare yourself gather various facts on uh data that is\npertinent to the problem and this part of it actually is very necessary uh\n\n\nYou have to prepare\n\n\nThere is no short cut uhm\n\n\nUnless you got certain input you can't really proceed very well\n\n\nBut after you got all the necessary input and you're able to sense\nor to recognize the problem from different angles then you come to a more uh\nsubconscious or even unconscious called incubation where you are sleeping\nover the problem\n\n\nSomebody will say aiyah I think we cannot find the answer today let\nus sleep over it and think it over you know in our quieter time or something\nlike that and you will find that this is uh where your mind your conscious\nmind then let your unconscious mind that means a bigger part of your mind\nthink about it and sometimes you may have realized that uh after you had a\ngood sleep you wake up oh you say ah I have found the solution oh now I know\nthe solution huh \n\n\nThis is what my by mean by incubation and sometimes you may take uh\ndays or weeks even to come up with the idea huh but it is now being incubated\nhuh You all know what is incubation And then you come to illumination where\nyou see the light huh Illumination So now you have a bright idea the light\nswitched on huh illumination You would say 'Hah ah' or 'Eureka I got it or I\nfound it' is it huh this is the meaning I know the answer now suddenly out of\nthe blue huh You may have got this type of experience also but of course the\nlast point is that you have to verify it Is it really workable Does it need\nsome refinement and polishing and so on

used\nto nit nit-pick on everything right that you do\n\n\nSo I can I'll show you one of the uhm stories I did for Life and\nTimes and then you can criticize\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nSo if you guys don't pay attention fine I'll just drag this\nsession on\n\n\nYou all want to take your revenge\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay what is a documentary\n\n<$B> \n\nSh\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat is a documentary\n\n\nIt's a uhm you can see fantastic\n\n\nYou've got x-ray eyes or something\n\n\nOkay what is this closest to a documentary\n\n\nIt's closest to a news story and like a news story it is factual\n\n\nIt is based on real events\n\n\nCopy fast fast uh\n\n\nOkay well just because you're not examined on it you don't want to\ncopy\n\n\nThat's fine with me too you know\n\n\nThen I can move faster\n\n\nAlright what does it records and documents\n\n\nIn other words what can a documentary cover\n\n\nIt can cover an event a moment in history okay like the very first\nelection or the referendum whatever or a person's life the life of C K Tang a\ndocumentary on C K Tang\n\n\nHave you seen the guy\n\n\nWhy do you laugh\n\n\nA way of life okay\n\n\nYou might want uh want to document the the changes Kerwin go\nthrough <unclear> word </unclear> metamorphosis of Kerwin Heng Social\nbehaviour okay\n\n\nWhat sort of social behaviour can you think of for that documentary\n\n\nOh dating courtship love\n\n<$B> \n\nOh please please uh\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay things like that you know\n\n\nA documentary on mental illness etceteras\n\n\nSo a documentary can be on whole variety of topics but it actually\ngoes beyond the who what when and how\n\n\nWhat is it that makes the documentary different\n\n\nA documentary explains the why questions\n\n\nYou guys do news writing who what when how you hardly can cover the\nwhy in a news story and all the more not so for a TV story\n\n\nA TV news story there's no time to explain the why unless you take\nmore than two minutes\n\n\nSo in a documentary it actually explains the why\n\n\nNow if there are so many similarities how is it different from a\nnews feature\n\n\nMore in-depth and how would it affect the look of the documentary\nthen\n\n\nIf you have to cover something more in-depth what happens\n\n\nYou need more time okay\n\n\nFirst of all you notice that a documentary is much longer ah must\nit always be slow-paced\n\n\nWhat sort of documentaries have a slow pace\n\n\nWhat have you seen\n\n\nNature\n\n\nYa\n\n\nThose are mostly slow-paced or some sometimes documentaries on\nbehaviour mental illness\n\n\nYou actually need to show the person's uhm actions and and\nbehaviour right in its actual context rather than just hitting all over\n\n\nSo the length uh and the pace depends on the story itself\n\n\nThe angles and the areas covered of course as you pointed out more\nin-depth so you cover from various areas various angles looking at the topic\nfrom different angles and pace and rhythm\n\n\nNow some documents may be slow-paced right through\n\n\nslow-fast-and-slow because you have to sustain interest for half\nand hour for an hour\n\n\nIt depends\n\n\nNow I can't even keep at my own\n\n\nOkay actually follows through\n\n\nIt's a follow-through of an event or a period of development\n\n\nOkay either you document it as it happens that's what most\ndocumentaries all are uh are are about they document things as it happens\n\n\nBut sometimes things uh have already happened\n\n\nWhat do you do\n\n\nWhat can you do\n\n\nIf something has already happened and you want to document it still\nyou re-enact right by possible dramatization or re-enactment\n\n\nHow many of you have seen uhm My name is Bertha\n\n\nMy name is Nadra not Bertha okay\n\n\nThat is uh what do you call that kind of documentaries\n\n\nDocu-drama or dramatized documentary ya\n\n\nNow dramatized documentary a dramatized documentary has some\nproblems\n\n\nWhat is one of the main problems that a documentary uh producer of\na dramatized documentary would face\n\n\nAccuracy\n\n\nIn what sense\n\n\nWell basically because when you are dramatizing something you take\nsome dramatic licence right and that can border upon some fictionalization\nyou over-dramatize it so that it it's more compact and more interesting for\nuhm television\n\n\nSo in other words what happens is that if you over-dramatize it or\nyou may add on little details which is so-called not true okay\n\n\nAnd when that happens the persons involved or even the institutions\ninvolved can sue you\n\n\nYou know they took a long while over this documentary My name is\nNadra not Bertha\n\n\nIt's started well the producer started doing it before I left SBC\nand was just telecast this year and that's because of sourcing for the p\npeople alright getting the person to well getting the various persons to talk\nabout what happened so that when they get the actors and actresses together\nthey can actually portray the people involved in that charac in that in that\nuhm uhm mannerisms or whatever you see\n\n\nSo if the person is very energetic he'll por portray that image\n\n\nSomeone who is very soft and gentle you have to portray that image\ntoo okay\n\n\nOkay what's involved in a preparation and production of a\ndocumentary\n\n\nWhat's involved\n\n\nIn the very first very first thing you have to do\n\n\nSay for a new story research Okay research you have to find out as\nmuch as possible at this stage\n\n\nWe should never purposely exclude information What happens when you\ndo decide to say highlight a certain angle of a document <unclear> word\n</unclear> an an issue and you exclude all other issues you may distort okay\nyou may distort the story\n\n\nYou have a you need a full understanding of a topic before you\nactually zero in on the angle you want\n\n\nSo there's content or subject research you read up you find out\nabout the subject\n\n\nMaterials research\n\n\nNow this is slightly different from the content research\n\n\nOkay later on I'll show you this story on uhm at the movies\n\n\nIt's about uhm it's tracing the various uh tracks of movies that\nhave passed through the ages through Singapore cinema etceteras\n\n\nSo okay I want to do something on cinema the very first cinema I\nknow it's uh it's along Beach Road\n\n\nBut where do I find it\n\n\nI mean so I've to research and check out what sort of materials do\nI get\n\n\nBlack and white photos from archives or <unclear> word </unclear>\nfootage film footage okay <unclear> word </unclear> have to look for\nmaterials\n\n\nAnd you have to check whether what you read about whether it can be\nportrayed or visualized\n\n\nThen of course there's a location surveys\n\n\nThe location survey is really for you to go to that place it's like\nbeing there\n\n\nBut sometimes you can't go on a location surveys right\n\n\nSometimes you just have to go and see for yourself like the last\ntime when you did hong hong bao special\n\n\nEven you have to survey the location you can't figure out what\nhappens and so you have to play by ear\n\n\nNow there're times of course you can actually use your common sense\neven though you don't survey that place you can find out look for let's say\nI'm supposed to film an missile covet the lady's uh gunboat and nuh okay I\nwent for the resear uh res uh recce but I can't bring the whole crew along so\nwhat can I do\n\n\nI'll ask the navy for magazines alright and in the magazines\nthey'll of course they will have pictures of their their gunboats etceteras\nand I'll show it to my camera crew\n\n\nSo in a way you're surveying and researching for them too\n\n\nSo think of all the means you have whatever is within your means\nto uhm get well get yourself well-prepared and yours your uh production team\nto be well-prepared too\n\n\nNow besides that you also have research interviews interview\npeople concerned talk to them before you actually record the interview for a\nvideo and at the end of course you've to collate your research okay\n\n\nNow in collating your research you're actually preparing a sort of\na script For those of you who whom I taught for one session for radio last\nsemester\n\n\nRemember I did something on uhm SBC uh English drama so the\nvarious areas you know that we can discuss uh if you were to deal with it as\na story what are the ang various angles you can take\n\n\nRight you can talk about Singlish\n\n\nYou can talk about local playwrights\n\n\nYou can talk about uhm stories with a local context okay\n\n\nSo you have to collate your research and when you prepare your\nscript bear in mind many stages many drafts and each draft will get better\nand closer it should really get closer to what its story should look like in\nthe end\n\n\nFirst stage treatment what else\n\n\nYou should all know what a treatment should contain right\n\n\nThose who don't do not go out and say uh Miss Lee taught us\nbecause I didn't not teach you did not not teach you what a treatment is\n\n\nA treatment is supposed to sell your story\n\n\nNow your editor may say okay go ahead with the treatment just for\naudience\n\n\nSometimes you may be doing a documentary for overseas consumption\nyour audience is different so you have to bear that in mind too\n\n\nNow in a documentary it's quite different from a news story okay\n\n\nYou may be able to figure out okay in this story in this news\nstory this is the kind of angle this is what's new that's why I'm going for\nthis press conference or that's why I'm attending this event\n\n\nIn a documentary things are you may probably have to count from\nthe people you interview something that's new something that's not being\ntalked about or little known but you're not going to give put the headline\nright up at the top right\n\n\nYou probably have an outline an outline strip covering the various\nareas okay\n\n\nSo you'll be uhm what you call an outline script or a shooting\nscript\n\n\nNow you can't predict everything that can happen during a\ndocumentary because things unfold as you go along especially when you're\ncovering uhm things that's uh of a present moment alright you do a\ndocumentary on a present event\n\n\nSo you have an outline uh script to guide you okay based on the\nresearch these are things that might happen and these are things you can\nshoot and you work along you you would uhm revise your script as you go along\n\n\nIt's really what you call scripting the unpredictable\n\n\nNow when you say you're scripting the unpredictable it is say you\ndon't really not have a script you have a partially scripted uhm script with\nyou to say okay uhm what can we talk about\n\n\nSay when I went to Holland to do a story on frozen pork ugh frozen\npigs sorry for students Muslims\n\n\nBut you know I had to I have to go to Holland to do a uh little\nstory for Friday Background\n\n\nIt was in line with this eat frozen pork <unclear> word </unclear>\nbecause they were phasing out the the pig farms in Ponggol\n\n\nSo I really didn't know what to expect because I've never been to\na factory before\n\n\nThey will slaughter the pigs and freeze it freeze the pigs within\ntwo and a half hours alright the hygiene conditions etceteras\n\n\nSo what I wrote into the script for all the camera crew would be\nuhm as we go along alright\n\n\nThese are various steps and I'll write down you know uhm they told\nme there's slaughter there's the burning you know uh singeing the pigs so\nthat the bristles will fall off etceteras \n\n\nYa So I'll write down the different steps but when you are there\nit's really playing by ear I don't know what to expect but even so you have\nto decide okay what are the cut-aways As we go along of course there's this\nchap who was with us from the factory and someone from the Meat Association\nand he'll tell us this is important Ya there is a Meat Association because\nHolland you know exporting lots of meat Not in <unclear> word </unclear> not\nlike in Singapore We only have what tourist association hotel association and\nthen what else So he would tell us he would tell us what is important Now My\ngoodness Tsk hai now in Holland in The Netherlands you know Of course we stay\nin Amsterdam and every morning we've to have to drive two and a half hours up\ninto the the outskirts the pig farms Okay now the point I want to make is thi\n\n<$B> \n\nwhen you're filming when you're filming and there's someone\nwho's with you who knows more about the place you need to talk to that person\nas you're filming and say this is important ask him why is it important and\nthat's your other research It's while you're doing the the filming you're\nactually researching in detail Now the other thing is of course this is this\nis an instance where I couldn't I wasn't sent ahead of the crew to do my\nracking my research etcetra so I have to do it then and there when we are\nshooting But what happens when you are in Singapore Is there a reason to do\nit on as you are going along researching as you uhm film Sometimes yes let's\nsay when you want to do a story on nature you know the birds are supposed to\nbe in a forest On the day you racky the birds are all there in fact I counted\nten types ten species within an hour I was so ex excited The day I went\nwithout Christopher Hales the guy who the ornithtologist the the day I went\nwith my crew and without him there was no bird to be sighted for One whole\nmorning It's not it's really no joke because uhm they just don't come out on\nthe day I don't know Maybe the guys were smoking so the <unclear> word\n</unclear> birds can read some smoke signals and I was panicking my will Woon\nTye Ho understand you know that we were there but there were no birds\nespecially since I sold him the story by telling him that at least ten\nspecies you know Within half an hour can see ten species Okay sold do the\nstory First day of shoot no birds second of sh shoot no birds so what happens\nSo you have to script the unpredictable Whatever you have write in A\nbreakdown script okay", "subdomain":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nWith me tonight are three observers of the political scene\n\n\nMr Goh Chok Tong has asked for the endorsement for his premiership\nand he says the PAP will get their endorsement if it improves on its 1988\npercentage                                                        \n\n\nBy how many percentage points\n\n\nDo you think it will have to improve to gain a comfortable margin\nBilveer\n\n<$B> \n\nYa while dangerous to speculate I think after Nomination Day\nresults and in view of the lack of general substantive issues ah as I see in\nthis particular election my guess is to get a clear mandate anything between\nsixty four to sixty eight would be regarded in my view as a clear endorsement\n\n<$A> \n\nThian Ser do you share the view\n\n<$C> \n\nIt's not a bad number to put into a ball park area\n\n\nIn part because the Prime Minister has said that he wants more open\nviews\n\n\nSo once you allow a system where you begin to relax uh the system to\nallow more people to come in and debate issues there is bound to be uh less\nof a consensus that we saw a couple of elections back when it was as high as\neighty odd percent\n\n\nSo somewhere between sixty odd to seventy\n\n\nSeventy'll be a very good number\n\n\nI think those are reasonable standards Peter\n\n<$D> \n\nWell I wouldn't want to box the poor Prime Minister in with\nnumbers you know because uh I think the the way the campaign is fought you\nknow is more important than longer term\n\n\nIt's so easy to say he's got so many more points percentage points\nso he's got the endorsement he's done better\n\n\nBut more important is the people's uh feed uh perception of the\nconfidence level of the government\n\n<$A> \n\nWell I was coming to that point as to whether you know there\nis another measure because he did talk about the people's perception and what\ndo you understand by that Peter\n\n<$D> \n\nWell I understand well I don't know what I can't be reading\nhis mind but I would say this some people are saying look why so kiasu you\nknow why the suddenness of this election uh and a few other things like that\n\n\nIs the gov does the government know something that we don't know\n\n<$B> \n\nIs the economy going to go plunging down\n\n\nSo I think there's some recovery there you know so it's uh the\nperception of how confident government is uh how much leeway it gives the\nopposition uh I don't say backward backwards you know because even in sports\nyou know you you you gain every advantage you can according to the rules of\nthe game\n\n<$C> \n\nIf I could just go back to the point that you made as to why\nthis election is being called now\n\n\nWhy in fact is Mr Goh going to the election at this point when uh\nafter the 1988 election the PAP did say that the win could be interpreted as\na mandate for the new team\n\n\nSo why in fact is Mr Goh going for an election now\n\n<$D> \n\nI I think uh because he thinks the conditions are right you\nknow and this is the best time for the best win\n\n\nI think he has put a very strong case that he wants the people to\njudge him for who he is and his style\n\n\nHis National Day Rally performance was by any observer's view a\nvery good performance\n\n\nAnd he's trying to establish himself once and for all that this is\nhis cabinet this is his government\n\n\nSo I think this campaign hangs on his personality and whether the\nchanges have taken place because we have seen accommodation of uh some of the ?\nopposition type views into the PAP's style of government now\n\n\nAt one time it was the the general consensus was that the\ngovernment is very confident of itself it states its case that's it\n\n\nBut now we're getting a position where the PAP is sort of saying\nwell we have a position but we're willing to listen to the public we're\nlisten to to to to the voters\n\n\nThat's happen in say the ah car policy that's now happening in the\narea of health cost\n\n\nSo I think Mr Goh says to be judged on his personality and approach\nit it would be appear to be an important issue here\n\n\nI would agree with clear with things here that the real question is\nactually political legitimacy\n\n\nI think there is a feeling that he has been given the premiership\nwithout the mandate of the people and now he think the timing is right\n\n\nEconomically politically the ground is sweet that uh this is better\nthan anytime to go to the people because he will have to go to the people\neither 92 or 93 so judging from that political uh soundness I think he's\ngoing to the people for the simple reason of legitimacy nothing more than\nthat\n\n<$D> \n\nWell following up from what you say can I say something here?\n\n\nHe's already there legitimate because at the last election it was\nquite clear that year Mr Lee Kuan Yew was going to hand over so uhm the\nmandate is already there uhm\n\n\nI think there's a clear difference in this time zone Peter in the\nsense that since that mandate was given to him he has made several changes\nmore in style if you like more open approach also substance\n\n\nNow this is where this is where the measure is being taken and I\nfeel that you know the Nomination results are not in his favour because he\nwill he already has a majority\n\n<$A> \n\nWould you would you say that the change in policy direction\nthat you talked about is sufficient reason to seek a fresh mandate\n\n<$C> \n\nI think it is sufficient because the change has been happening\nfairly rapidly and it's time to take a measure of how people are reacting\n\n\nI think the the worries over the economy probably there's some pros\nin it I mean what's happened in Russia is very major\n\n<$A> \n\nIs the government concerned about the possible economic\ndownturn\n\n\nI'm not sure they hasn't said that openly but uh many people in the\nbusiness sector are concerned of possible fears because cost are still rising\nin the economy and that's a problem\n\n<$D> \n\nAnd I think in addition to that ah in this country I think\nwhat hits the pocket is politically significant and I think there is a\nperception I mean it may be wrong but at least there's a perception even in\nthe public mind that the economy is taking slowly but surely a flight\n\n\nAnd politically if you don't hit now and you hit later whether in\n92 or 93 I think it can be costly\n\n\nSo it's from that perspective that I think the timing factor and\nits relationship with economic cannot be dismissed\n\n<$A> \n\nIf we can come back to Mr Goh pushing himself as the issue in\nthis election uh is there a risk for him in doing this Peter\n\n<$C> \n\nI think uhm it's a big risk but I think being the uh good\npolitician a good leader that he is he is he has organised the environment so\nthat uh it's a it's a risk as a bold move it's a risk but uh minimum risk\nbecause uh you know he he's he hasn't talked about opposition type issues\n\n<$B> \n\nUh I agree with Thian Ser except that I won't call it\nopposition type issues I I say the concerns of the people you know\n\n\nI think in the past opposition grappled some of those concerns much\nbetter than the PAP but now the PAP has uh has taken the initiative on many\nof these issues that affect people's feelings and people's aspirations\n\n\nI think one result of a strong victory in this coming general\nelections would be that the PAP is seen to have institutionalized itself\nbecause in the past we have the leadership on the Prime Minister Lee very\ncapable very strong and to a certain extent very dogmatic in approach\n\n<$C> \n\nIt's nothing wrong in that it give us twenty-five years of\nsuccess but I think what we are saying now is a new approach and if that's a\nendorsed strongly by the people then we have seen that most people will\naccept that the PAP is get around for many more years to come and perhaps one\ngood result of that would be that together with that exception uh sorry with\nthat acceptance of the PAP as a the ruling party as long as it accepts a\nwider range of views together with that will be acceptance of opposition\n\n<$A> \n\nPick up from what you're saying about the opposition now the\nSDP has made a call for this election to be treated as a by-election\n\n\nHow far do you see them getting with this\n\n<$D> \n\nI think by virtue of the fact that uh the PAP has already had\na walk-over victory this effect is likely to be enhanced that makes Mr Goh's\njob a lot tougher\n\n\nI think the PAP has to campaign much much strongly\n\n\nThere are a few uh areas it would appear where candidates who\nperformed well in the last election are standing again\n\n<$A> \n\nSo do you see I'm talking about opposition candidates\n\n\nDo you see a replay of some of the major contests for example in\nBukit Gombak and Eunos\n\n<$B> \n\nPossibly possibly I think a lot of people will be watching\nEunos not that the candidates uh put on either side I think because both\nsides have put forward interesting candidates and obviously a swing in the\nGRC is very significant in terms of the majority and that will have a real\neffect\n\n<$C> \n\nI in fact I would differ a bit I think the SDP's strategy is\nmaking a virtue out of necessity\n\n\nThat's one point of looking at it because I think they will caught\nbut uh on the other hand about the swing I think basically there are four\nfactors which will affect an election outcome\n\n\nOne would be I think the people's desire for a PAP government which\nhas been achieved\n\n\nThere are three other factors I think the type and nature of\nnatural national issues type and nature of local issues and finally they need\nto signal to the government about what it can do and cannot do\n\n\nI think the the other three will affect the swing and my feeling is\nat this present time the ground is far more sweeter compared to 88 when there\nwere a lot of sulfurist issues and I think I do not uh share Kansas' view\nthat it's going to be a shift\n\n<$A> \n\nSo what you're saying is that there are no national issues\nthat's bothering the public at this point\n\n<$C> \n\nI I would think there's no national substantive issue which\ncan fundamentally affect the flavour and uh to that extent I think it's going\nto work on Mr Goh's advantage\n\n\nI think Mr Goh's halo effect is going to play itself down to the\nlocal constituencies whereas in the past the local issues were very critical\nI mean you talk of whether the MP meets the man or not whether that you what\nwhat what type of flats you're living in so on and so forth\n\n\nBut I think this time now it's different because we are seeing a\nmajor political transition a lot of the past issues were in fact related to\nMr Lee and his style\n\n\nThis time I think it's Mr Goh and his style and he's seeking an\nendorsement\n\n\nI think people will go out to vote if not for anything at least for\nMr Goh\n\n\nI've heard people saying I like Mr Goh I don't like the MP I don't\nknow what to do but I'd rather vote with Mr Goh than take a gamble you know\n\n<$A> \n\nPeter do you think in announcing a by-election in twelve to\neighteen months Mr Goh has in fact undercut the strategy of the opposition\n\n\n\nI don't think so because uh you know the uh the uh the the bas the\nbasic strength of the SDP's tactic in saying look let's fight this\nby-election is still there you know whether whether it's by-election now or\nby-election one and a half years from now so it's a it's a good move on the\nSDP and uh it's a it's a very uh compelling argument so we come back to the\npoint of performance of the candidates and the party's performance so\ngovernment must show must I think make uh recognise that uh one big factor is\nthe Fanner's concept that people now have you know and the fact that\ngovernment has reformed today you know it's going to make that an e even more\nimportant factor that you got to appear to be fair I like to take up a point\nthat Bilveer raise which is that uh the issues are very different this tim eI\nthink he's right on that score the issues are different but it does not make\nthe election easier precisely because more people in the constituencies will\nbe able to take the view well if we have a few more opposition members in\nparliament what is so wrong with that uh that's going to be a factor in this\ncoming elections I think the other point that many people will have to\nconsider would what kind of manifestos are the opposition parties coming up\nwith the concept of gracious society is in a way within the PAP's manifesto I\nthink unless the opposition is not conscious So are you saying then there\nreally aren't any clear differences between the manifestos of the opposition\nand the PAP Bet you PAP will disagree with that But i would I would tend to\nsay that the PAP have been very successful in hijacking many of the\nopposition parties' manifestos especially when it come to talking of uh the\nlower classes talking about the poorer people I think this caring\ncompassionate society has been very successfully uh modelled on by Mr Goh and\nit's really I think going to deliver That's one I'm coming to the by-election\nstrategy I think people are confused you know you have not run your GE you're\nalready talking about your by-election That's one I think Number two it was\nmainly to overcome two basic arguments one was the SDP call for treating it\nas a by-election Number two was the J.B.J. problem and the fact that he chose\nto address it people amy argue that eh ther's something in it you know you\njust can't dismiss it as a ploy a tactic and I think people are beginning to\nthink seriously about it and that that maybe this is an afterthought rather\nthan really something thought through and that may in fact hurt Mr Goh in th\nlong run Do you see the issues changing over the next ten days of the\ncampaign you know anything can happen from Nomination Day to Polling Day but\nuh that's a a gen a general truth I would argue but uh my sense said i would\nnot feel that fundamental of a change I think there will be basically quite\nlow-key unless the opposition is able to come on with something out of their\nhead But Mr Goh has draw has drawn the ground rules in the sense by pitting\nhimself as the centre of this arena so it will be about mr Goh this time but\nperhaps uh longer run the worry will be a about Mr Goh's political role\nwithin the neighbourhood in uh ASEAN and so on the opposition parties need to\ncome out more strongly with uh manifestos in respect of where they want\nSingapore go in the future Well I think it's not a manifesto bad backward all\nyou know because the positions have have already closed uh closed closed up\nthe the the uh endorsement of of mr Goh and uh I think he has a lot of\ngoodwill and a lot of people will vote for him but that would that could be\nuh negated to some extent by local issues like constituencies and how the uh\nthe candidates uh look because the uh I think Singaporeans become more\nsophisticated now they they do not accept the argument that unless I have a\nthe PAP has a bigger mandate in percentage terms is going to be bad for the\ncountry so it's not that black and white lah Now while though the local\nissues are important at this particular time in point somehow or another they\nhave been made quite insignificant by the fact that there is a call and the\ncall is where does Mr Goh stand not just now maybe in the next decade or so I\nthink that's very pressing well the last election was described as a\nwatershed election now if you had to describe this one in just one word what\nwould you say Peter we'll start with you Turning point Legitimacy Mr Goh's\nelection Thank you gentlemen for your views well tomorrow the hustings begin\nwith political rallies and dialogue sessions the campaign will continue for\nnine days after which you decide

{"text": "<$A> \n\nGood evening and welcome to Points of View\n\n\nIt's taken a long time coming but we're finally having an Open\nUniversity\n\n\nIt will become a reality by July this year\n\n\nThe Singapore Open University provides a second chance for adults\nwho've missed out on tertiary education\n\n\nThey'll now be able to study for a local degree part-time\n\n\nJust who are eligible\n\n\nWe've been told that those with at least two 'A' levels can apply\nand others with a certificate in education or diploma from recognised\ninstitution here are also eligible\n\n\nThe SOU is expected to start with two degree programs a Bachelor of\nArts and a Bachelor of Science program both with honours options\n\n\nOther programs may be introduced later on\n\n\nMany of you may be wondering what an Open University is like\n\n\nWell Britain has had an Open University for the last twenty years\n\n\nLet's take a look at how their system works\n\n\nThe British Open University's supposed to serve as a model for ours\nbut peculiarities of the Singapore environment will also have to be\nconsidered\n\n\nAnd to discuss just what the Open University here should be like I\nhave with me in the studio four panelists Mr Liew Syn Paw Member of\nParliament for Tanglin and GPC Chairman for Education Dr Gwee Ee Hian\nlong-standing educationist of forty-two years and also Executive Director of\nthe Singapore Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry Dr Seet Ai Mee who've\nspent three months at the Institute of South-east Asian studies doing\nresearch on an Open University and because educational poli policies have\nalways had an impact on employment we have Mr George Abraham Honorary\nSecretary-General of the Singapore Federation of Chambers of Commerce and\nIndustry to give the employers' perspective\n\n\nAlso joining us in tonight's discussion are former students of the\nBritish Open University local graduates and non-graduates as well as\nprofessionals\n\n\nWell we've what the British Open University model is like uh what\ncan the Singapore Open University be like and what can it do for this society\n\n\nMr Liew <unclear> word </unclear> you'd like to begin\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I think first of all the Open University in Singapore can\nprovide our working adults who've missed out on a university degree with a\nsecond chance to go back and pursue a degree while working at the same time\n\n\nIt will also enable our workers to upgrade and to acquire new\nknowledge and skills uh so that they can make career switches or changes and\nit will also meet the needs of those who want to get a degree for\nself-actualisation or self-fulfilment\n\n\nIt will also raise the talent pool in Singapore of professional\nmanagerial and uh administrative staff and this will make Singapore even more\ncompetitive in this region in the world and of course lastly it will bring us\none step nearer to being the education centre of this region\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm Dr Gwee as an educationist of such long-standing do you\nagree with uh Mr Liew's last point that we could become a centre for\neducation\n\n<$C> \n\nUh yes I would think so\n\n\nI think uh we already have a sub-system of uh higher education I\nmean we all know it uh lots of people are pursuing uh studies leading to\nexternal degrees of London University and uh various twinning programs are\nalso uh operating in the SIM and couple of other institutions\n\n\nAlso I feel that a large number would like to be in the system had\nit not been for the high cost the relatively high cost of uh reading for a\ndegree\n\n\nTherefore the Open University meets a really very real need in\nSingapore\n\n\nHow Open it is you know I think that's the question you see I do\nnot know we can discuss later on correct\n\n<$A> \n\nWell I think that is something that we will be discussing in\nthis discussion\n\n\nDr Seet what is your research or what do you think an Open\nUniversity could contribute to our society\n\n<$D> \n\nWell recently our ministers have been talking about levelling\nup economically and uh at when I was in the Ministry of Education I talked\nabout raising the base of the education pyramid\n\n\nI think the Open University can do this effectively\n\n\nI don't think you level up by pulling the people at the top\n\n\nThe levelling up has to be moving the people at the bottom up to a\nsec to a to a higher notch and I think this uh Open University will be\nperforming this as its major role for society\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm Mr Abraham what would the employers' point of view be\n\n<$E> \n\nI think the most important factor is that it provides\nflexibility to a system that is usually seen to be rigid\n\n\nIt allows people to learn at their own pace\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$E> \n\nAnd also for those who have picked up experience in their work\nit would be a an opportunity for them to relate to work that they are doing\nto some of the studies that they are doing\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$E> \n\nAnd I think employers would look upon it positively because if\ntheir employees show an interest in bettering themselves I think it speaks\nfor a certain degree of motivation that exists in that individual\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm well let's take the question over to the audience now\n\n\nWe have in fact two people Jacky and Christopher who have been\nthrough the British Open University system Perhaps you could tell us what it\ndid for you\n\n<$A> \n\nJacky what was your experience\n\n<$B> \n\nMrs <unclear> word </unclear> what do you think would be some\nof the social uhm considerations that we have in our environment as far as an\nOpen University is concerned\n\n<$F> \n\nWell there would be the question of whether people would want\nto take up a an Open University course for self-fulfilment or for the sake of\nadvancing their careers\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$F> \n\nAnd I think uh there should be room for both uh such students\nyou know <unclear> word </unclear> wouldn't matter about their motives as\nlong as they wanted to do the course and who are able to persevere with it\n\n\nI think it would be useful either category of student\n\n\nI personally know of people who are unable to go to university in\nthe fifties and sixties uh because they have to support their families you\nknow the father died or something like that happened and they have the\nqualifications to enter university and they couldn't\n\n\nAnd uh in a way these people have always regretted not having a\ndegree and even if they are mature people now in their forties in their\nfifties I think they would be very happy to go back to studying and in order\nto you know have at last this kind of uh opportunity to uh enrich their minds\nso\n\n<$A> \n\nWell Eddie Yeo one of those who's uh taking up a course\n\n\nIs that to help your career or is it a a part of continuing\neducation \n\n<$A> \n\nIf I could take up the point you made about a possible glut of\ngraduates\n\n\nDoes the panel see this happening\n\n\nWhat is the likely impact of this\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I think we're still a long way from having a glut of\ngraduates\n\n\nI believe now we've we only have about twelve percent of the each\ncohort coming out as a graduate and uh I'm quite sure that our economy can\ntake many more graduates than twelve percent of each cohort\n\n\nAnd our aim in fact is to have twenty percent of uh graduates\nthat's a long <unclear> word </unclear> and forty percent polytechnic\ngraduates\n\n\nSo I see perhaps this pool of forty percent who might graduate from\npoly might look for a further degree with the SOU after they finish\n\n<$A> \n\nPerhaps\n\n<$C> \n\nI don't think there will be a glut you know because if we\ninsist on very high standards uh and uh from our experience we see that so\nmany of our children cannot even or find it very difficult to pass the either\nthe PSLE 'O' level 'A' level so uh that won't be really a glut unless God has\nbeen exceptionally kind to us that we've got so many talented people\n\n\nWe always talk about the talent talent pool but I because of that\nprecisely because of that uh I think we got to uh have a fairly good idea of\nwhat standard of our Open University should be rather than just giving away\npaper simply because they miss their opportunity once during their lifetime\n\n<$A> \n\nSo are you saying then that uhm it should be equivalent to the\nother traditional universities then\n\n<$C> \n\nYes it's very difficult to say what is equivalent or what is\nnot equivalent but I would certainly like to peg our uh BA or BSc standard to\nthe to our two universities at least\n\n<$D> \n\nI would agree wholeheartedly with Doc uh Dr Gwee on this issue\nbecause I feel that it is important that standards be upheld because the\nuniversity must produce graduates who then can hold their heads high with any\nother graduate in Singapore or overseas and when this is established the\nfuture of the Singapore Open University is established\n\n\nSo I think this is an a very important factor\n\n<$A> \n\nBut there also have been criticisms that the minimum standards\nwhich have already come out of having two 'A' levels are in fact uh rather\nrestrictive\n\n\nI mean are there any members of the audience who have a view on\nthat\n\n<$A> \n\nBut doesn't that in a sense uh you know deprive others who\nprobably have a better chance of continuing right through\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm Farrod you're one of those who've in fact done all your\nqualifications part-time while waiting while working uh tell us how much of a\nstrain was it\n\n\nI mean it it was did you feel at times that you wanted to drop out\n\n<$G> \n\nUh I don't because unfortunately because uh I always wanted to\ngo to university and because the consensus I've to work first and that being\nthe case uh I more or less self-motivated to finish the course <unclear> word\n</unclear> <unclear> word </unclear> do\n\n\nBut I do find that what you need is discipline discipline\ndiscipline and that is really the the the the the ultimatum of uh part-time\neducation\n\n<$A> \n\nZulklifi you have a different point you you believe that\nstandards can in fact be maintained after a person has enrolled rather than\nat the admission level\n\n<$H> \n\nI think the question of standards at the moment can be quite\nspeculative because it's not uh a question of just the candidates or the\nquestion of the support facility they have had at the university the\nlecturers the whole set-up has got to be uh <unclear> word </unclear> to and\nnot only that uhm it depends very much on the first batch of graduates and\nsucceeding ones uh prove that they can uh be uh very useful uh practitioners\nhaving gone through university\n\n\nUh having said that standards must be maintained and I think if you\ntalk about having an university that's geared towards people who are already\nworking for example technicians wanting to improve themselves to engineers I\nthink most likely not only they're self-motivated they are already in that\nfield of in that in that area they are better able to understand uh work in a\ntechnical area\n\n\nI think that is fine but certainly you you cannot overcome you\ncan't overcome the fear of you know having to maintain the standards\n\n<$E> \n\nTend to agree with the question of standards because we do not\nwant a situation where people end up discriminating against the universities\nand making the SOU into a second-class university because I think the points\nthat have been made is a fact that it's not just a combination of the\ncurriculum but also the people who are doing the program\n\n\nThe important thing that we have to understand it is the time frame\nthat is given to these people that is different from the standard university\nformat and so they are able to us that to their advantage\n\n\nThen I think if the basic standards are kept the kind of graduates\nthat come out of the SOU would be the type that employers would be quite\nhappy to have in their organization \n\n<$A> \n\nHmh perhaps at this point we can move on to what form the\nOpen University uhm should take We've had very bare details so far we know\nthere will be two basic courses in arts in sciences Uh but perhaps um Dr Seet\nyou could tell us you know what your views are on curriculum planning Do you\nthink basic degrees in arts and sciences suffice?\n\n<$D> \n\nWell traditionally all the Open Universities throughout the\nworld have had uh situations where they started with target audiences or\ntarget groups and the main target group has been primary school teachers who\nneed to update and get degrees So this is essentially what's happening I I\nbelieve that's why the Ministry of Education is offering arts and sciences\nBut in Singapore there's a second target group and that is the seventy\nthousand polytechnic graduates who've graduated over the last twenty years So\nthere is a second group here in Singapore compared to the first group So I\nbelieve that uh the Open University should move into a technology based uh uh\nteaching at distanced level This uh discussion has also centred mainly on the\nbasic degree Uh again traditionally Open Universities throughout the world\nhave it started with basic degrees and found them that they have a second and\nvery important role and that is of continuing education You cannot have an\neffective continuing education body without a very strong academic base So it\nis necessary to almost have a university to have a good continuing education\nprogram So as a result we find that the UK OU when they first started they\ndid not look at it as a very important program but within seven years ten\nyears they moved into a very large continuing education program and if you\nnow assess UK OU uh Sukotai Tamaterak University almost all the Open\nUniversities in the world you find that uh the undergraduate program consists\nof about twenty-five to thirty percent of the enrolment of the Open\nUniversity and the majority uh of the students are on continuing education\nprogram I feel this is a very important uh factor and I I believe SOU will\nmove along this direction because technology goes out of date within five to\nten years and one of the grouses of forty to fifty year old uh employees have\nbeen that they are redundant SOU can and should address this problem of\ntechnology redundancy by offering continuing education program\n\n<$A> \n\nWell you've talked about the importance on a national level\nBut let's ask somebody in the audience here Colin for example you're in\ninsurance Do you think continuing education is important? Would you go to the\nSOU for continuing education?  E: As an employer myself I find people\ncome back with basic degree with MBAs without experience in the uh\ntechnological field and I I can see the danger because the the the the the uh\nsuccess ladder every round is a degree the additional degree you get the\nfaster you move But there there may be a danger because as you move faster in\nthat round for those who have no experience The matured the experienced\npeople will be overtaken will be sidelined So there is a danger there So I\nthink where that's where the Open University should come in here and say okay\nthese are the people to dislodge in in this paper chase Let's do something\nfor them so that they can stay in their in in the rat race while going up the\nladder So I think that's where the SOU come very important here\n\n<$A> \n\nEdmund is that true that employers really look at the uh\npiece of paper before they decide to take someone on", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "e5cfdc3f-080d-4211-a83e-031acd0cdfea", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.544839+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nGood evening and welcome to Points of View\n\n\nTonight we talk about divorce why it's on the rise in Singapore and\nhow we can make it less traumatic\n\n\nBut first I have someone with me who's been through a divorce\n\n\nRosaline you've been divorced eighteen years\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's right\n\n<$A> \n\nCould you tell us what were the circumstances which led up to\nyour divorce\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd I wish I could say many good things about my husband but he\nwas a very violent man\n\n\nI was very much tortured by physical violence and he was an\nunreasonable man\n\n\nEach time I would talk to him uhm I just ended up being beaten up\nand uh the last straw was when he committed adultery\n\n\nI could not take it any more\n\n<$A> \n\nThank you Rosaline\n\n\nWell Rosaline isn't alone\n\n\nShe's one of a growing number of people who are divorced and\naccording to the latest figures ten couples get divorced every day\n\n\nThat's twice the number ten years ago\n\n\nA common reason suggested is that more women are working now and\ntheir husbands are no longer <unclear> word </unclear> so divorce becomes an\neasy option\n\n\nBut is that the main reason for the increasing divorce rate or is\nthe situation more complex than that\n\n\nTo discuss this and other issues I have with me an audience of\nsocial workers sociologists lawyers and people who are divorced\n\n\nMr Kenneth Chen MP for Hong Kah GRC is also joining us for the\ndiscussion\n\n\nMr Chen by the way is happily married with two children\n\n\nBut first let's get back uh get back to you Rosaline\n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nUh now at the time of the your divorce were you working now\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I've always been working\n\n<$A> \n\nNow had you not been working at the time would it have been as\neasy for you to go through with the divorce\n\n<$B> \n\nIf I had not been working I would have given it a second\nthought I would do it for the sake of my children\n\n\nEven though it would mean that I wouldn't have much quality life\nuhm as that something that you know if I had to depend on my husband totally\nthen definitely it would have been it wouldn't have been easy to go through\nthis\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay uh Rosaline has just told us uhm that uh the fact that\nshe was working at the time made it easier for her to go through the divorce\n\n\nMr Yeo is that uhm one of the reasons why divorce is on the\nincrease in Singapore with more women working today\n\n<$C> \n\nI think it is a bit too naive uh to isolate one factor as\ncontributing to divorce uh\n\n\nI think there are uhm various factors\n\n\nSo to just say that it's because a woman have uh economic power\nthat leads to divorce I think that helps them have power in their\ndecision-making because we don't want to cast the woman in a very powerless\nposition <unclear> word </unclear> this situation\n\n\nCertainly they helps them make a decision\n\n<$A> \n\nSo what are the factors then you think today that act uh that\nhas caused this increase in divorce rates\n\n<$C> \n\nI can think of a number of factors uh from my counselling\nexperience with the couples have marital problems and those who are\nconsidering divorce\n\n\nI think one obvious factor is a fact that uh marriage as it stands\nI mean is not a very easy relationship to maintain\n\n\nUh we often take a romantic idea that you know if two persons are\nhappy in marriage then they can live happily ever after\n\n\nI think that is a myth and we must realise that it is not easy to\nlive intimately with another person for a long period of time\n\n\nThe other reality I suppose is that when we have any kind of change\nin society you're bound to have all kinds of pressures on this type of\nrelationship and when people change they have options they have other ways of\nlooking at things\n\n\nThen they may also not become very tolerant when they live together\nand I think that also contributes to a part of the decision-making\n\n<$A> \n\nUh Nirmala uh Mr Yeo mentioned the that people have this\nromantic view towards marriage and uh sometimes it's not fulfilled this\nromantic side of view that they have\n\n\nWould you agree with that\n\n<$D> \n\nYes to some extent\n\n\nUh again it I I agree with him that uh one can't just look for one\nsingle cause\n\n\nBut if you look at marriages today it's quite different from\nmarriage as before\n\n\nThere is a great deal more stress and strain for husbands and wives\nbecause uh previously for example what a woman wants of her husband is to\nplay the breadwinner role and in fact that becomes crucial especially when\nwomen do not work\n\n\nThere is a heavy material dependence and in a sense when you go out\nto work the material dependence is lessened\n\n\nIt gives women more power and I think that this power that they do\nderive through working is important because they have the choice of getting\nout of a bad marriage and I and I firmly support that\n\n<$A> \n\nBut with its uh the higher educational level of of women today\nuh is that a contributing factor to divorce other other other expectations\nchanging as a result of their their higher education\n\n<$D> \n\nI think the expectations are changing because one now looks uh\nuh for in a marriage one looks for a husband to also share in a marriage I\nmean their notions of sharing of intimacy with the social intimacy sexual\nintimacy uh uhm and you must remember that previously when people married the\nchildren arrived earlier\n\n\nNow with Family Planning and also we own HDB flats so uh people now\nuh don't live in extended families any more\n\n\nSo the nucleus of relation has become has sort of focused upon more\nand more upon the husband and wife and they need and there's great deal more\ndemands on each other to deliver certain emotional goods which previously\ncould be delivered through other kinds of relationships\n\n<$A> \n\nUh Doc Doctor Neo\n\n<$E> \n\nYes uhm I would like to add that when we look at the\neducational level of woman and attribute that to be one of the main reasons\nfor increasing divorce it's misleading because then it assumes that uh don't\neducate the woman and therefore divorce rate will go down\n\n\nI think education is just one of the means for woman as well as for\nman to be having a better understanding perhaps about what marriage is\n\n\nBut unfortunately uh we don't seem to find that uh many adults when\nthey want to get married they're not sure whether the reasons why they want\nto get into a marriage situation is very clearly established\n\n\nSo it has to do with partly expectations because it goes back to\nthe fact that we don't have the right kind of education and awareness to\nprepare individuals to have life-long commitment with each other\n\n\nSo I I will not you know easily and and over-generalizing this say\nthat it is just a fact that women are more educated now and therefore it\nleads to you know more divorces\n\n\nI think this is where we tend to over-focus on woman uh and I I\nincreasingly feel that uh the problem could also lie with the fact that we\nmen have not been able to keep up with the progress of women and that adds\nadditional strain to the situation as well you see <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> because they they want equal partnership\njust not that uh uh husband brings money and that's it the end of the\nrelationship\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd the men can't take that sometimes you see so\n\n<$D> \n\nYa\n\n<$C> \n\nIn a sense I think you want to balance up\n\n\nThen we have to also equally uh look at the men and see how they\nare not able to cope with that kind of a change of expectations so they are\nthey are fixed with their own expectations\n\n<$A> \n\nWould you agree that uh people today you think are getting\nmarried at uh an age when they are not ready to get married Mr Chen\n\n<$F> \n\nI don't think this is the problem uh al although statistics\nshows that the marriage group getting break up break up uh broken up lies\nquite a lot on the twenty five to thirty five group\n\n\nI think the correct way to assess this is uh by percentage because\nthose who married later uh in re uh in comparison to those who married\nearlier is much less in number first and uh and those who have married for\nfive years compared to those who have married for ten years the the ten uh\nthose who married for ten year has more resilience to marriage than five\nyears\n\n\nSo I think uh I wouldn't place too much notice on uh age as a\nfactor\n\n<$A> \n\nBut if we look at the uh the uh demands upon society on\nindividuals uh these days with more and more men and women out working uh do\nyou think they rush into marriage too soon with uh you know what with trying\nto to uh stabilise their career and the bringing up uh bring up children and\nuh looking after wife at the same time or a husband Mr Mr Yeo\n\n<$C> \n\nI think that is true when we look at the the divorce rate\nfalling within that age range\n\n\nI think that is a very stressful part of an adult's life you know\nand if we look at those who are graduates even more so because they've just\ncome into the world of work and then you add that to other expectation from\nhaving to try and own a home and try to build your career build your marriage\nhave children we're loading them with a lot of things you know\n\n\nAnd and I don't know if we if we should not take a careful look at\nthe <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nCan we slow that down a little bit rather than try and push people\nbut of course then we get another problem you see people then marry later and\nlater we have another set of problem\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> you were married in an early age and\nyou're divorced now\n\n\nNow how did the how did that affect your uh your marriage your\ncareer and your family\n\n\nWere you able to reconcile the two <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nNow you know marriage usually not always it is the man that is more\nlikely to step of line a wee bit out of line whereas it is the woman who is\nthe one who got a repeat and nag and nag\n\n\nPerhaps nagging is a too strong a word but will tend to repeat and\nrepeat\n\n\nTherefore if the man were to step a bit out of line the woman\nshould pretend that she didn't see it and when the woman nag that man should\npretend that he doesn't hear it\n\n\nThere you there you are you got a perfect marriage <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n\nNo I I would I would I would disagree with Melvin because in my\ncase uhm I used to try and talk it with my husband and he was beyond talking\nand uh finally I gave up talking to him because I saw the futility of talking\nto him and he didn't only step a little bit of out of line\n\n\nHe went out of line totally many times he wouldn't come back\n\n\nThe times he came back he was a total stranger and then we would\nhave arguments again and there was very one bad incident there that happened\nthat he wanted to hit me and and I was happy because the father the mother\nthe whole family saw what kind of husband I was living with\n\n\nSo it's not true what he said you know you stop nagging and the man\ndon't do anything\n\n\nIn my husband's case no not nothing was going to stop him so I stop\nand I I I told myself it's no use talking to him \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay now you were a divorcee you're a divorcee as well\n\n\nUhm can you relate with to uh Rosaline's situation <unclear> word\n</unclear> Well not really because I think uh you know for <unclear> word\n</unclear> and myself it was a very amicable kind of divorce You know and I\nthink uh what we both had in mind really was the welfare of the children It\nwas now how do we un try and get them to cope with this very new situation\n<unclear> word </unclear> : I think for me I have two very uh wonderful\nparents who are very supportive an elder sister who is uh you know she's not\nmarried but you know she's got all the maternal instincts and by far and\nlarge she's the one who uh was the disciplinarian you know when I was trying\nto work through my own grief <unclear> word </unclear> : Uh but that lead to\nthe other point you were raising earlier uhm whether uhm it is the age the\nmarrying age uhm people are marrying younger whether that is a contributing\nfactor but I guess it's not just the age it's what is expected out of a\nperson after marriage like can you go on as a person individual going through\nachieving your ambition can you go through a career or studies for that\nmatter I mean whatever that is important that is contributing factor because\nif uh individual life stops uh at the point of marriage then really the age\nis not uh important I guess but expectations of society and ourselves\n\n<$A> \n\nSo what what's the secret recipe then for healthy marriage uh\nMrs Hia you've been married uh for quite some time Now what's the secret to\nyour success Mrs Hia: Well I think we there are uh several ingredients I can\nthink of I won't say it's just one secret Uh not least of all I think uhm\nit's the fact that we share common values I think Uh there is a common\nreference point some things we would accept as being right and acceptable and\nothers not Uh that's one and uh also a commitment to say that we will make it\nwork This is the end there there is no option\n\n<$A> \n\nMr Hia would you like to add to your wife's comments Mr Hia:\nYes I think I I would agree with what uh my wife has just said I think the\nother area is is a mutual respect for each other's interests I think uh I\nthink based on the uh what we have said here clearly uhm in the current\nenvironment with women working and so on there's clearly a need for greater\nfreedom as it were and the the space that is needed uh women may need more\nspace in terms of keeping a <unclear> word </unclear> doing their own thing\nand and so it has mutual respect that there's a need for space for each other\nto do their own thing while also there's a need for us to be together from\ntime to time in consolidating the family So the this mutual respect of each\nother's time and space is very important as well Mrs Hia: I think <unclear>\nword </unclear> : I'm sorry we seem to have neglected is the atmosphere\nbecause marriage is not just husband and wife alone We have in-laws as well\nand in some cases in fact in most cases I think interfering in-laws would be\na very strong contributing factor to the breakdown of the marriage no matter\nhow hard the couple tries to save a marriage because I've come across cases\nwhere both parties are very highly educated both have commitment to each\nother to have the marriage worked out but filial piety comes in you know the\nchildren are put in a very difficult position either to you know to have to\nsave the marriage or to to have the parents Mr Hia: I think that's where\nthat's where we earlier spoke about marriage counselling I think that is the\npoint of time where these kind of issues get brought up because I think\nmarriage couns uh pre-marital counselling to me is not simply just uh finding\nout whether you are compatible in terms of you know your income or things\nlike that and perhaps that's that's where the problem <unclear> word\n</unclear> we're paying too much attention to qualifications and perhaps not\nenough attention to quality the quality the two people have and you know with\nproper pre-marital counselling perhaps some of these things can be brought up\nincluding potential problems with in-laws", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "04a896a1-bd64-46b1-a65d-cb694bfb76c5", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.546101+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nGood evening and welcome to Points of View\n\n\nFor the next few weeks we'll be seeing a lot more performances\ncoming our way\n\n\nThis month alone we've had the International Cantonese Opera\nFestival and Theatre Carnival on the Hill\n\n\nIn June it's the Festival of Arts and groups from all over the world\nwill be coming here so clearly Singapore is becoming a vibrant place for the\narts\n\n\nBut how are the local groups faring\n\n\nJust how far can they go and what will it take to ensure this\nvibrancy continues\n\n\nTo discuss this I have with me the local artistes themselves\njournalists and corporate sponsors\n\n\nLet me begin with you Ekachai\n\n\nNow you work with Action Theatre and you've been performing on\npart-time basis and as I understand doing quite well\n\n\nNow what are you doing actually to bring in the audience\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm well there's I think there's no secret formula but uhm for\nAction Theatre I think the fact that our group comprises a lot of\nprofessionals somehow the way we go about uhm doing marketing our product we\ntend to have uhm I think what we call a twin focus approach\n\n\nI think you need to focus both on the creative side of the business\nuh and also the business side of marketing the art uhm so I think that that's\nthat's how we begin so far\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay so you've been quite successful then\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nBut then there are other art uh artistes and performers aren't\ndoing so well\n\n\nMrs Bhasker could you tell us some of the problems you're facing\n\n<$A> \n\nNow I guess okay the key word here the key issue that we've\nall been talking so far is marketing\n\n\nNow Robert uhm you bring in some groups overseas groups into\nSingapore what exactly does marketing entail\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm one has to access the situation first and see what the\ncompetition is uhm and then try and gauge a level at which you can sell your\ntickets at and uh after doing that then you have to embark on a series of\nvery creative things on how to bring the message to the people\n\n\nAnd I I would say the first thing would be to look within\nyourselves and find what are the interesting points about the production that\nwould be uhm of interest to the to the audience and the secondly is to to\nembark on very creative ways on getting that message across\n\n\nIt could be it's simply designing T-shirt it could be distributing\nhand bills but it could also be uh undertaking very uh unlikely and very\nentertaining ways of publicising the events here\n\n\nThere are countless ways of doing that <&>  Mr Austin)\n\n<$A> \n\nSo what are the what are the audiences looking for\n\n\nIs it more commercial <&>  Mr Austin)\n\n<$A> \n\nSabri\n\n<$D> \n\nWell basically from the Malay theatre scene we have this uh\nproblem of the direction of arts\n\n\nThe old school of thought the old guard believe that they shouldn't\nbe any marketing at all\n\n\nYou perform that's your obligation to the society\n\n\nAnd I I felt this is not wrong but it's not really healthy to the\ndevelopment of arts in the Malay community\n\n\nBut another another interesting thing that I would like to point\nout is marketing the arts for Singaporean sake I think uh Mrs Bhaskar was\nsaying that for Indian dance only got Indian uh audience\n\n\nWhy can't we do we we devise a marketing stra strategy that can uh\npull Chinese audience in Malay drama or Malay audience seeing an Indian dance\n\n\nUh we are lacking this uh we don't have the audience\n\n\nBut the audience are not educated to appreciate other racial arts\nyou see\n\n\nThe the problem become so acute in the sense that we are being\nexpose to Western theatre Western and the type of education and I guess sad\nto say that a lot of people appreciate ballet more or a lot of people go to\nto see opera more even if they don't under understand the language\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay sorry to interrupt Robert yes\n\n<$E> \n\nYah I think the uhm mountain efforts is not really what I\nwould call project specific\n\n\nMarketing effort is a sustain effort\n\n\nFor example if you look at the so called quote unquote popularity\nof foreign shows that are brought in here I think one doesn't realise that\nthe foreign shows that are being brought in have already expended an enormous\namount of time and money in promoting themselves before even got here\n\n\nAnd also whereas we tend I think in Singapore to look at it from a\nproject to project basis in the mean time you know between performances\nbetween productions we really don't see this effort being maintained\n\n\nYou seem just you know when the last curtain fall so that's it's we\nlook forward to the next one not realising in marketing it's a continuous and\na total process\n\n<$A> \n\nBut who should be responsible for the marketing then\n\n<$E> \n\nI think the organisations themselves should be responsible\n\n\nThey must be aware of the fact that as you've mention quite rightly\nin the beginning they have a product they want to sell the product and they\nmust reach out to the buying public in order to be able to sell the product\n\n<$A> \n\nBut Mrs Bhasker now what is the problem with uh you marketing\nit yourself marketing your performance \n\n\nMrs Bhasker \n\n<$F> \n\nSometimes uhm it's very nice for each community to be able to\nenjoy its own art form\n\n\nBut I think especially in a multi-racial society like Singapore\nit's important for us to be able for a Chinese to be able to enjoy Indian\ndance or Malay dance or uhm you know uh Chinese opera and things like that\n\n\nSo I think perhaps we should try not only to market it to audiences\nwho are familiar with our type of art but also to a more a wider audience so\nthat it becomes a more cultured society\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay how do you go about doing that\n\n\nDoes that mean you have to make it more accessible\n\n\nDo you have to commercialise it to a certain degree\n\n<$G> \n\nI personally believe that uhm this ethnic art should become\nless purist in attitude\n\n\nThey should uhm have more collaboration uhm more experimental in in\nnature and I think uh in that way uh it can lift itself out of from being a\nfolk art in the way folk dance to art\n\n\nI think that they should uhm market themselves in the way that the\nuh they should uh ex be more experimental\n\n\nUhm that doesn't mean they are diluting themselves\n\n<$G> \n\nBut I think the collaboration should be more on the more\nestablished arts like ballet like uh drama like uh Cantonese opera\n\n\nCantonese opera it's it has caught on in the drama scene\n\n\nPeople are trying to stage drama in in Cantonese form in opera form\nand this this will uh raise awareness of uh of the traditional art\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay let me ask you Winnifred now what is it that okay\nsponsors are looking for when they decide on what uh group to actually\nsponsor\n\n\nWhat do they what do they want\n\n<$H> \n\nI don't claim I can speak for all sponsors\n\n\nI would feel that one of the most important criteria is to see to\nwhat extent the contribution of sponsors can go to support that particular\nartiste or that particular group\n\n\nI don't think sponsorship in the arts uhm should be approach from\nfrom the sponsors' point of view that this is a mass market\n\n\nThere is no mass market in the arts so once the sponsors realise\nthat they should not go into sponsoring the arts with a marketing perspective\nthat is selling more of their products they should see how far their dollar\ncan go in helping that particular group or that particular artiste to further\nhis talent and his craft\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I think that people like Shell you know are bombarded with\nwith request for sponsorship all the time and I think as arts groups uh we\nneed to be able to tell the sponsor that sponsor us this is what we can give\nyou in the return I think the times are gone when you have a lot of sponsors\nwho would just throw money and say oh sponsor your art all they need is a\nlogo They need something more\n\n<$A> \n\nRight right to to me that would make a lot that would a lot of\nsense\n\n\nIf I were a sponsor I mean I would be looking for uhm a product or\na group of people that could actually bring in more audience and promote my\nyou know my own cer my own uh product\n\n\nThat's that's not happening with a lot of art groups A lot of art\ngroups are not getting the people in and that's way it's difficult for them\nto find sponsors\n\n<$A> \n\nWell Theatreworks is drawing in the audiences\n\n<$I> \n\nBut uh if you look at uh I think you cannot just say that uh\nwe'll sponsor you if you bring in the audience\n\n\nI think some sponsorship is developmental in the sense that you\nknow there's no guarantee that there will be a pay-off at the end I think an\nexample is\n\n<$A> \n\nBut not all sponsors are as altruistic as that I mean they\nhave personally they have personally uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nYes but sponsors also look at that developmental point of view\nand uh uh I think that if you just want the guarantee of the audience then\nit's going to be a bad for the arts\n\n\nOf course you know uh sponsors deserve to get the dollar uhm\nmileage for the dollar to be put in but also there's the other side\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$H> \n\nI would say that one of the very important points that has\nbeen touched on by Tan How when it comes to how sponsors uh assess whether to\ngo in for a sponsorship\n\n\nIf our assessment of the potential of it that particular person or\nthat particular group how far do we think he or she or that group can go in\ntheir artistic attainment and fulfilment That is very important\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay that is a good point\n\n\nGood that brings us to the next point\n\n\nNow do we actually have that sort of quality\n\n\nDo we have enough of those people uh that sponsors are looking for\nJohn\n\n<$A> \n\nSo there is an overkill\n\n<$I> \n\nAre you saying that sponsors should only sponsor the man and\nnot the boys\n\n<$A> \n\nSorry uhm Ekachai go ahead\n\n<$B> \n\nI think it has a lot to do more with the quality of the\nartistic product I think part-time necessary does not necessarily equal\namateurish\n\n\nIn fact I think in the way our our cultures cultural scene is\ngrowing there are a lot of part-time groups that are producing very very\nquality uh good quality work compared to say product say professional\ncompanies\n\n\nProfessional companies are constraint by the fact that they have to\ncome up with a season\n\n\nThere are how many plays the theatres are booked are booked full\nyou know they have to fill the theatre spaces so they have to come up with\nthe plays and num and certain number of production whereas part-time groups\ncan they can be passion driven and they don't need to be you know uh survival\ndriven or profit driven\n\n<$A> \n\nDo we need a central body to actually coordinate with when\nthese performances actually come on\n\n<$E> \n\nI don't think so\n\n\nI think in the long-term it's all a learning process for for all of\nus now\n\n\nI think in the long-term the market will in fact decide how to this\nthing is going to pan out\n\n\nUhm if we look at the experience of the Festival of Arts which has\nbeen running about for ten twelve years fourteen years now uhm despite the\nfact that it's only held, once every two years a biennial event It falls very\nnaturally into the June period and the we for example now find that there are\nother groups who are planning to perform in Singapore planning the schedule\naround the festival \n\n\nFor example I believe Moscow circus is coming in again a around\nthe festival time but they are not part of the festival but they lock in very\nnicely and come in early into the schedule or the festival", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nGood evening and welcome to Points of View\n\n\nNot enough married people and not enough babies that was the message\nalmost ten years ago\n\n\nWhat followed became known as the Great Marriage Debate\n\n\nSince then a lot has been done to encourage singles to get married\n\n\nI'm sure you've heard of the SDU SDS and SPS\n\n\nThese are specialized groups that have been set up to cater to\nsingles from all walks of life and yet the number of marriages has not\nincreased and even those who are getting married are doing so later and\nhaving children later as well\n\n\nTonight we ask why\n\n\nWhy is this pattern of delayed marriage and parenthood still so\nwidespread even after attempts to change it\n\n\nTo discuss this I have with me experts and laymen both single and\nmarried Mr K Shanmugam who's the MP for the Sembawang GRC is also with us\ntonight\n\n\nI also have with me two people who typify married people and single\npeople\n\n\nLet's start with you Terry\n\n\nYou're a bachelor and you've got many friends who are also singles\n\n\nWhy do you think singles are delaying marriage\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I'm not sure if I actually typify the actual bachelor so\nI'll just say this for myself but you find that uhm in many situation they\nthey people are being pushed to excel in their career they want to go places\nthey want to travel they want to get experience in working overseas and\nthings like that don't work very well when you are actually within a marriage\nwhen you got uhm a wife and two kids to bring along with you and I think that\ntends to put people uh to make people want to push marriage further until\nthey've actually gone through that kind of thing\n\n<$A> \n\nWeng Hee as a married man do you think that his points are\nvalid\n\n<$C> \n\nYes basically I would agree with what Terry has said but I'd\nlike to add on and say that Singaporeans these days aspire to a standard of\nliving characterized by material comfort and a lot of independence a lot of\nfreedom and as a result they now perceive marriage as an institution which\nwill impose on their financial well-being and on their independence\n\n\nHence uh they'll want to have a good life they want to achieve\nbefore they finally settle down\n\n<$A> \n\nIs are these points valid 'Achievement-oriented people' 'Career-minded\npeople' is it all valid\n\n<$D> \n\nWell these days actually their education opportunities and\nwork opportunities are much greater I think it's natural when these\nopportunities are available people tend to marry a bit later\n\n\nFirstly they'll finish education much later and then they had have\nto establish their career so I think it's not uh something we don't expect if\nmarriage is being delayed\n\n<$A> \n\nWhere did this mindset arise though\n\n\nIs it something that we've been brought up to think\n\n<$E> \n\nI think that's that's true because since young we have been\nconditioned to think that you know we have to go through various stages\n\n\nFirst you go to say primary school secondary school after that JC\nuniversity and during that path you're not allowed to think about anything\nelse\n\n\nSo the the mindset is is has been conditioned from right from young\n\n<$C> \n\nYa I recall that as a Junior College student uhm courtship was\nfrowned upon\n\n\nWe were told 'Go and complete your studies' uh 'Go into National\nService You'll be more matured uh the the the after having gone through the\nprocess of National Service go to university study develop a career and then\nyou can uh think about marriage\n\n\nFor some reason uh students who actually have steady girlfriends in\njunior college days are perceived as students who are not serious in their\nwork\n\n\nThere's a stigma attached to uh being involved in a relationship in\njunior college\n\n<$A> \n\nBut is this stigma something that we carry with us over into\nour working lives and into our adulthood\n\n<$F> \n\nI think perhaps it's much more\n\n\nReally the structure because both the last two have mentioned\nreally what a macro thing the kind of society we live in that they that the\nexpectations of us are different the opportunities are different\n\n\nI mean in the old days there weren't that many nice things happen\nto you and getting married was one of the few really nice things\n\n\nNow there are so many other nice and exciting things and I think in\n<unclear> word </unclear> part of the kind of society we live in\n\n<$G> \n\nWe see that more and more couples are opting for what I call\ncompanionate marriages and so uhm we do have uh people who go through a sort\nof a childless period and it's as if their life is in a holding pattern you\nknow and then suddenly after many years then there's the arrival of the first\nchild\n\n\nUhm but I think uh the norm is still that most people tend to\nassociate marriage with parenthood\n\n<$A> \n\nWell can't companionship like you said be achieved without\nmarriage\n\n\nPeople can very happily have boyfriends or girlfriends steady\nrelationships and not take a plunge and get married\n\n\nWhat's the difference\n\n<$H> \n\nWell many people might ask that question which is why you find\na significant number of of proportion of people uh choosing to stay single\nand uh choosing to have uh such friendships and without going into whether\nit's right or wrong or passing any moral judgements we must realize that\nthere's there's such a feeling and uhm such an attitude and deal with that in\nthe larger social context\n\n<$A> \n\nBut should we be dealing with attitudes though because some\npeople have considered that social engineering\n\n<$H> \n\nWell I think perhaps uh you've got me wrong I I didn't suggest\nthat you try and change such social attitudes\n\n\nWell what you're saying well there is a perceived policy a\nsuggestion that we should try and have as many as much well try and increase\nthe number of marriages uh try and have people marry and if possible have\nchildren\n\n\nNow that's stated as a larger social call but when you try and\nstate that as a social call you must realize that there are significant\nnumber of people who will choose not to get married for various reasons\neconomic social personal but in a free society we are entitled to do that and\na large group of people who may choose to get married but not have children\n\n\nYou must try and understand why they choose to do that and then I\ndon't think it is there's anything wrong in trying to uh win their hearts by\nreason if you think it's better that they should get married and they should\nhave children\n\n<$A> \n\nRight before we of course try and win their hearts we have to\nlook into uh reasons as to why people are still putting it off putting\nmarriage off\n\n\nPerhaps we can hear from one of the singles in our group Edward\n\n<$I> \n\nWell basically a very significant reason is uh financial\nreason\n\n\nMarriage is not a cheap thing these days and I think a lot of\npeople have got very high expectations what uh they expect of the marriage\n\n\nSo it means that uh you you find people saving up for house some of\nthem even want a landed property before they get married and uh it may be a\nbit uh too much of a high expectation but there it goes you know uh people do\nthink that way\n\n<$D> \n\nWell I I know a lot of people like to have a Mercedes Benz but\nthat doesn't stop them from moving about by bus or MRT or even in a less\nexpensive car you know\n\n<$A> \n\nComes down to a question of priorities doesn't it\n\n<$D> \n\nYes that's right\n\n<$A> \n\nAre are these expectations uhm realistic\n\n<$H> \n\nWell I'm not quite sure that I agree with Edward in saying\nthat uh financial considerations play a significant part because in the\nmodern Singapore you would find that both marriage partners are probably\nworking\n\n\nSo marriage does not per se impose a greater economic burden on\neither party\n\n\nI think it's more a question of whether people feel materially\ncommitted towards marriage and uh these may perhaps be additional factors\n\n\nThe economic factors could may perhaps be additional factors but\nthe more important factor is whether people feel that they can be involved in\na relationship which is going to demand quite a bit out of them\n\n\nSo it's one of attitude a different social value system\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> I pick up on the point you made\nabout commitment\n\n\nThere are some people who would say well marriage is is too much of\na commitment in a sense that it's a mental burden for them\n\n\nIs this a fair judgement\n\n<$J> \n\nI think it's rather unfair because if you're not married how\ncan you make a judgement\n\n\nIt's too much of a commitment <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nBut then once you're married it's too late <unclear> word\n</unclear> wrong\n\n<$J> \n\nWell see this see this where perception comes in because the\nmoment you have a pre-conceived idea as to what marriage is about then you\nmay be put off getting married and and that's a concern there that the longer\nyou delay then the less uh uh unfortunate it will be for Singapore\n\n<$C> \n\nI'm inclined to believe that Singaporeans generally value\nfidelity in marriage and they also look forward to a happy uh family life\n\n\nFor that reason they are afraid to commit lest they may make a\nwrong decision\n\n\nIt is this fear of making a wrong decision uh that actually\nprevents a lot from really committing to a relationship\n\n<$A> \n\nSo you're saying that fear actually cripples some quarters of\npeople is that right for you\n\n<$H> \n\nWell fear perhaps might be too strong a word putting it in a\ncontext of a modern-day Singapore\n\n\nTo perhaps fairly ambitious individuals perhaps well-educated\ntrying to live with each other trying to adjust themselves to each other\n\n\nIt's not an easy thing to do and and uh perhaps fear might be too\nstrong a word but certainly uhm the uh the it can be described that fact can\nbe described as one of 'Well I'm not quite sure that I'm prepared to make\nthat many adjustments at this stage I prefer my freedom to the uh adjustments\nthat I have to make if I commit'\n\n<$A> \n\nIs that a selfish attitude though\n\n<$H> \n\nI don't think that is right to characterize that attitude as a\nselfish attitude because I'm not harming anyone else\n\n\nI'm should should be free to live my life as I wish\n\n<$A> \n\nSo there is a very real argument for remaining single after\nall is that right\n\n<$F> \n\nI think actually <unclear> word </unclear> although the older\ngeneration are pictured as always encouraging the young to marry sometimes\nthey have contributed to this fear of commitment because many of the older\ngeneration of parents kept emphasising to their children how much sacrifice\nthey've made oh how what a burden life had been\n\n\nI'm not sure if that hasn't really contributed to the fear of\ncommitment that people have mentioned even though it's come from a very\nconservative source\n\n<$I> \n\nNot only that I think a lot of uh uh parents who tell their\nkids you know uh 'If you get married you know be sure you look after your\nchildren\n\n\nUh uh I'm not about to look after the kids for you after I've\nstruggled all these years'\n\n\nI think that's not being supportive also because I if if indeed\nthey are trying to promote uh the kids getting married faster then I think\nyou know you might be prepared to also look to the grandchildren uh\n\n<$F> \n\nWell speaking as a working grandmother I I I think we just\nhave to face it with uh we will fewer and fewer as we get a higher proportion\nof grandmothers who've got complete in secondary schooling and the society\nsays it needs everybody's labour contribution\n\n\nI agree the granny's the obvious one but I think we probably got to\nlearn to do without her because society says everybody must you know take\npart in economic activity \n\n<$B> \n\nActually I'm wondering if there's a clash there somewhere\nbecause when you're talking about uhm the parent giving a negative uhm\nconnotation to the idea of marriage and all that I was thinking sometimes in\nmany cases you don't really have a a a valid pattern to follow in terms of\nthe parent because of the uhm rapid change of uh as <unclear> word </unclear>\nas <unclear> word </unclear> I said progress social progress and economic\nprogress The actual pattern and relationship and lifestyle of my parents\ndon't actually apply anymore to to a uhm double-income family <unclear> word\n</unclear> career\n\n<$A> \n\nYou're saying that are you saying that we're lacking role\nmodels\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I think so\n\n<$A> \n\nIs that true Is that a valid point Role-models\n\n<$G> \n\nI think I would tend to agree with with that because I think\nuhm young couples nowadays are what we call uh pioneers in a brave new world\nyou know and then the old rules don't apply because the older generation\nalways said 'Oh we used to have ten a dozen' You know they grow like bean\nsprouts I mean what's the problem And then you know our generation today with\nthe you know high emphasis on being achievers and and also I think cost of\nliving Things are actually are are actually becoming much more expensive and\nI know that even though when you talk about women having to do a juggling act\nbut the men actually go through an intensifying act because they have to work\nthat much harder they have to stay back in the office that longer hours to\nearn the extra dollar you know So sometimes when you when you talk about a\npriority like you want somebody to be career-risked uhm he is going to be so\nuhm you know hard-driving that he probably won't be able to spend that much\ntime uhm at the homefront So I think we're really asking for a very

{"text": "<$A> \n\nSex yes s e x\n\n\nSome people say there's too much sex on the Singapore stage too much\nof a bad thing\n\n\nOther say you ain't seen nothing yet\n\n\nThere's not enough of the good thing but there are a few critics who\ngo so far to say that the over-indulgence is tainting Singapore theatre\n\n\nBefore we hear our studio guest let's watch a video clip of recent\nproductions so be comfortable and breathe normally\n\n<$A> \n\nI got to check my pulse rate how's yours\n\n\nWell was that interesting disgusting or you may be thinking what's\nthe big deal\n\n\nMaybe I'll start with you Keng Sen\n\n\nWhat's the big deal\n\n\nIs there really too much sex on Singapore stage\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I think that uh I mean I've been looking at the at the\nclips right and two of the plays were directed by myself\n\n<$A> \n\nThat's why that's why we brought you here\n\n<$B> \n\nYah and uhm I suppose I'm more incline to what's the big deal\nbecause I feel that uh at this moment Singaporean theatre is still exploring\nyou know so it's really of a a virgin I mean we are we are uhm we've been\ndoing Singlish in Singaporean theatre for the last uh five six years in a\nvery intense way uhm and if we start dictating right now what to write to the\nplaywright I think that we are self-censoring to\n\n<$A> \n\nYour <unclear> word </unclear> but the question is why\nexploring just the sexual themes there are so many other things\n\n<$B> \n\nI think that then it must be important enough to the\nplaywrights you see because maybe sexuality is an important concern uh for\nmany young people because they they see that uh as a a as an identity uh as a\na a a a a a way in which they can talk about other themes for instance\n\n<$A> \n\nOh let's check with the playwright\n\n\nIs that true\n\n<$C> \n\nWell I was first of all going to say that I dispute the fact\nthat there's a over-indulgence in\n\n<$A> \n\nOf course you're a lawyer right\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd I feel I can martial some facts to to back it up\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay let's have some facts\n\n<$C> \n\nI think that if you really look at the number of plays that\nhad been put up over the past three or four years uhm in the course of which\ngoes you know four or five clips were were chosen and uh presented to you in\nyou know close proximity wow sex sex sex\n\n\nI think in between all of these plays you'll find that there were\nmany other plays perhaps uhm not evoking so much media interest uh which\ndealt with quite apart from sex\n\n\nThe the the point we\n\n<$D> \n\nneed to address is not not merely a question of uhm whether we\nshould be self-censoring whether in fact when people take issue with\nplaywrights who write controversial plays then in fact this is a call for\nmore conservatives uh theatre\n\n\nI don't think that is that is the demand of a great many people\n\n\nI think a nude body on stage does does not in itself constitute uhm\na sexist gesture\n\n\nI think what what needs to be analysed is is really the question of\nwhat use it's made of the body uhm some ways that is where the problem lies\nyou see\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$D> \n\nHow do we make use of sexual expression\n\n<$B> \n\nI feel that right now most writers are really with because at\none stage Singaporean writing was not honest and we wanted Singaporean\nwriting to be honest so we told the playwright\n\n<$A> \n\nIs the honesty is the sex uh equate with honesty\n\n<$C> \n\nIt's one part of honesty\n\n\nI think you know\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay you agree with that Sanjay\n\n<$D> \n\nWell I think I think to a very large extent that's true\nalthough my concern here is also to want to push push the argument a little\nfurther\n\n\nI think there's a complex uhm situation here because on the one\nhand you have people who are in fact dealing with questions that are very\nclose to their hearts and I think this is valid this is legitimate this is\nvery important in fact\n\n\nBut on the other hand I think one of the things that uhm we need to\nbegin to address is also the question of how the question of sex or more\nimportantly sexuality begins to actually move into into into into larger\nquestions largely social questions as well and in in in in some ways for me\nthat is where the challenge of Singapore theatre lies\n\n<$A> \n\nSorry Sanjay I have to interrupt you here for a short break we\nget back to you\n\n\nStay tune we'll be back\n\n<$A> \n\nWelcome back\n\n\nThank you for staying tune in\n\n\nNow let get back to Sanjay you were saying\n\n<$D> \n\nUhm I'm thinking also of the the problem in in recent place\nwhere the question of censorship becomes a very central problem\n\n\nUhm and it seems to me uhm that you know you have on the one hand a\nliberal sort of uhm avant-garde uhm artiste uhm our artistic avant-garde\nagainst the conservative establishment and you know what happens in this\ndebate is uh\n\n<$A> \n\nYou feel the divide\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm I think definitely\n\n<$A> \n\nAre you avant-garde\n\n<$B> \n\nThere's divide there's divide\n\n\nI don't think there is so much avant-garde but I think that the\nproblem right now is that Singaporean society is so reactionary you see\n\n\nI feel I feel that artiste just need to have some leeway to explore\nto explore issues but as soon as issues are explored there is a big hue and\ncry and suddenly it explodes in our faces into something which which very\nsoon I think laws and regulations will be created to blunt us\n\n<$D> \n\nThis this is my point as well you see\n\n\nMy point is also that if or if if there is if the debate is\nstructured in these terms then then it becomes a case where you are you have\nan either or situation\n\n\nIf you are if you are critical of of of sex and the arts then you\nare necessarily you know pushed into the camp of of the conservatives\n\n\nI think it's important to see uhm that in the long run\n\n<$A> \n\nSurely you don't believe that do you\n\n<$D> \n\nNo to a very large extent that becomes that becomes how the\nargument is is structured you see\n\n\nIf you are against sex then you are also then you are necessarily a\nconservative\n\n\nI think it's important to see that you know one has to be against\nthe censorship one has to say that in fact we have to open up other\npossibilities of discussion while at the same time remaining very clear about\nthe kinds of directions we would like to go towards\n\n<$C> \n\nThat the reason that is that is\n\n<$A> \n\nCensorship is not the issue you know\n\n\nIs there too much sex\n\n<$C> \n\nYes it is it is the issue\n\n<$D> \n\nCensorship is very much central\n\n<$B> \n\nIt becomes an issue in this <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$D> \n\nLet me give you an example of this\n\n<$A> \n\nThe censors haven't said anything yet\n\n\nIt's the it's the audience who parts of the audience who are\nreacting\n\n<$B> \n\nBut you see the <unclear> word </unclear> the the interesting\nuh fact is that uh like Lady of Soul despite uh a big hue and cry it was sold\nout and denied and people were flocking to watch it and we had to extend this\netceteras etceteras so there is obviously so to me there's there's a a\nhypocrisy really because there's there's a demand but yet the we get a a big\nhue and cry about uh uh Lady of Soul\n\n<$D> \n\nYou see I'm glad you brought up the example of the Lady of\nSoul Ken San I mean I think it's an extremely interesting play but uhm my own\nfeelings about having read the play is is is is basically that uhm the\nplaywright himself found\n\n<$A> \n\nYou read the play or you saw the play\n\n<$D> \n\nI read the play unfortunate didn't see the production couldn't\nget tickets it was sold out\n\n\nUhm but what what is most what is most what is most interesting\n\n<$A> \n\nCliche is it\n\n<$D> \n\nWhat is most interesting about it was uhm that censorship\nbecame the subtext of this play\n\n\nIt became an attempt to see how far you could push uhm the limits\nof\n\n<$A> \n\nWas there any objective\n\n<$D> \n\nLegitimate not necessarily as the director I think\n\n<$B> \n\nI feel not necessarily as a director but I think that un\nunfortunately or fortunately the play confronts the censorship head on you\nsee because of uh the issues in it and because of certain uh certain pieces\nof uh of of writing so definitely the the Censorship Board had to had to\ndecide whether or not it was going to pass this play\n\n\nAnd in fact it came back at first uh uh with lots of cuts and\nsubsequently because of the the of the Censorship Review Committee and\nchanges made to the laws uh the play was allowed to be passed\n\n\nSo inevitably I think that you within this society because it's so\nreactionary anything which is uhm out of the norm is immediately questioned\nthrough censorship\n\n<$D> \n\nI think this is this is really the point you know I mean the\nthe problem is that playwrights can very often be forced into a position\nwhere they feel that you know the issue is censorship\n\n\nThe danger with this for me is that freedom the freedom of speech\nbecomes seen as an end in itself\n\n\nThis is a problem because censorship is a very important problem\nbut but I think the practitioner has to begin to recognise also that freedom\nof speech is only a means to an end\n\n<$C> \n\nI think we have to acknowledge here and and and and trust the\npeople who are who are uhm producing this work uhm creating it that uhm\nexcept for perhaps French lunatics most of us are interested in saying\nsomething interested in reaching our audience\n\n\nAnd uhm we we have we have things you want to say whether about sex\nor about uhm other issues where sex is used as al an analogy to to to\nhighlight certain point\n\n\nWhatever it is we we have serious things we do want to say and\ntaking that into consideration this is as this I see this as a process of\ncommunication between the audience and yourself to sew how how to come up\nwith that balance or the best way to bring a message across yet keep your\naudience I mean it's not\n\n<$A> \n\nBut who's your audience\n\n\nYou you talk about people being reactionary isn't that a bit\narrogant on your part\n\n<$C> \n\nI didn't use the word reactionary\n\n<$B> \n\nI used the word reactionary\n\n<$A> \n\nSo who's your audience Who's your audience\n\n<$B> \n\nI think that the that uh the reactionary people are actually\nthe media because because for me\n\n<$A> \n\nSo blame it on your the media\n\n<$B> \n\nWell the audience came\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat media isn't here\n\n<$B> \n\nThe audience came watched the show and some wrote back saying\nthat we hatred the show and some wrote back and said we loved the show\n\n\nUh but suddenly before we knew it the next week it was blown up\ninto an issue which uh threatened the whole state of theatre in Singapore and\nthat\n\n<$A> \n\nThreatened the whole state\n\n<$B> \n\nI mean it was described as threatening the state of theatre\nand uh that was very interesting for me because\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd in fact in your opening remarks I think you said it\nthreatened to taint Singapore <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nSome people said it was tainting theatre\n\n<$C> \n\nYes that's right\n\n<$A> \n\nBut I think you have used along those lines right Sanjay\n\n<$D> \n\nNo I I I this's precisely what I do not want to say I mean I\nthink it is important to see that the people who who who have problems with\nthe way in which sex is depicted in some plays are not arguing that in fact\nthe moral fabric of this society is being threatened \n\n\nThey are not arguing that we need more censorship\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat are they arguing\n\n<$D> \n\nThey are arguing", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nAnd staying with the subject of teenagers there has been\nconcern recently over a particular group of teens those labelled problem kids\n\n\nJudging by the figures for juvenile delinquency and a number of\nyoung people referred to organisations like Teen Challenge the problem seems\nto be growing\n\n\nBut to understand what's really happening we need to go beyond the\nstatistics and a statement of a social problem into the world of the troubled\nteenagers themselves\n\n\nWho are they and how can they be helped\n\n\nWell I have with me in the studio three social workers who have lots\nof experience in dealing with these kind of teenagers\n\n\nUhm perhaps to start off would you agree that when we say problem\nteenagers even though it is a label uhm we are referring to specific group of\nyoung people you know those with persistent behaviour problems whose parents\ndon't seem to be able to to cope with with them\n\n\nAnd uh who if we don't sort of help them they could become juvenile\ndelinquents\n\n<$B> \n\nUh the group that you're mentioning that is only a segment of\nthe whole population of uh teenagers that we need to be aware that inherent\naim adolescent development there are certain uh stresses and storms that they\nhave to go through and that require adjustment and coping skills from them\n\n<$A> \n\nBut what makes a a a teenager going through normal growing\npains become a a so call problem teenager\n\n\nWhat is that difference\n\n<$C> \n\nI like to see it as a point where the teenager kind of gets to\na point where he loses adults supervision whether it be uh the parent as the\nauthority figure or school uh with the teacher of principal and once he loses\nadult supervision then he will be open to more open to peer influence and\nthat can precipitate uh experimentation that leads to a certain type of\nbehaviour\n\n<$A> \n\nSo would you see the the root of the problem may be going back\nbeyond adolescent I mean to the child's uhm early development\n\n\nIs that where it starts\n\n\nIs it a relationship he has or doesn't have with his parents\n\n<$B> \n\nI think that early childhood experiences do have an effect on\nthe uh teenagers\n\n\nI think uh in present Singapore because of the success of our\npopulation policy parents see that children are precious resources and\ntherefore they become super-organised or they become too over-protective with\ntheir children and so from young they do not allow their children to learn to\nmake choices to make responsible decisions from the for themselves\n\n\nAnd I feel that if children from young because the decisions they\nmake are normally not that important so if you start from young like learning\nto choose what kind of clothes I want to wear how much I want to eat what I\nwant to eat I think that will help the children to learn to be independent\nand to prepare them for self care\n\n<$A> \n\nBut what about the group of parents that uhm simply don't have\nenough time for their children\n\n<$D> \n\nI think parents like it or not they have to spend adequate\ntime with them even if both parents are working which is quite common\nnowadays\n\n\nSo uh the only free time I suppose they have is in the evening and\nthey should try to make most use of it as they can as well as the weekends\n\n\nAnd uh we <unclear> word </unclear> we do find that there are quite\na lot of so called problem kids uh be due in large part to the background\nboth parents working the child may be fostered out and the child may have\nseveral foster care takers and parents do not spend enough time to build up\nthe relationship with them\n\n<$A> \n\nNow you uh actually operate the Parentline you actually take\ncalls from parents who think they have problems with their kids right\n\n\nWhat what do they say to you you know what do they how do they uhm\ncome to you with their problems\n\n<$D> \n\nOkay when they come to us with a problem of a teenage uh they\nare quite a number of common problems for example kids coming back late\nstaying out running away from home smoking or parents may feel that the kids\nare too young to have a boyfriend or girlfriend uh these are common problems\nthat they will bring up to us\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm so what okay what are the things that you would be\nconcerned about\n\n\nI mean uh kids sort of boy-girl relationships there's part of the\nnormal process of growing up right so what would you be concerned about\n\n<$D> \n\nI think I'm more concerned about the rising trend of abortion\nand uh promiscuity among the young and also the rising trend of suicide among\nthe teenagers too\n\n\nThere are quite a number of other problems stresses from uhm\npressures of school work uhm what else\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay yah sorry\n\n<$C> \n\nI was I feel that there are are other symptoms that we need to\nidentify\n\n\nI have increasing contact with parents that that indicates that uh\nthe youth begins to show rebellion before they are ten or begin to ask for\ntheir freedom uh before their teenage years uh well in advance two three\nyears in advance of their so called teenage years you know\n\n\nSo there are some symptoms uh that need to be recognise by the\nparents early uh and one of them is rebellion in the home\n\n\nThe other can be uh low performance uh in school uh grades and of\ncourse uh if it comes to the point of misbehaviour in school or truanting or\nrunning away from home starting with one night or over the weekend uh to\nthree days to five days these are symptoms of uhm uh problems that are\nalready beginning to arise in the young\n\n<$A> \n\nRight I think that's that's a very important what symptoms you\nknow what actually are these teenagers looking for\n\n\nThey're obviously crying out for something what do they need\n\n<$D> \n\nUsually they're asking for independence but from the parents'\npoint of view uh what they would see as a symptom is the lack of control\n\n\nI can't get my kid to listen to me anymore uh he's too demanding\nand he gets his own way\n\n\nI would think that that is the major symptom that they need to\nrecognise\n\n<$A> \n\nSo parents say they don't have enough control over their kids\n\n\nKids say they don't have enough freedom\n\n<$D> \n\nThat's right\n\n<$A> \n\nIs there somewhere for them to meet halfway\n\n<$B> \n\nI think they can negotiate because I think the parents need to\nrealise that uh as a children grow older they as they mature they have uh\nincreasing and better skills\n\n\nYou them opportunities to take part in decision-making and to let\ngo slowly\n\n\nAnd once you give them a chance and if they can show that they can\nresponsibility for themselves and also for the family and the society at\nlarge and then they can slowly let go\n\n<$C> \n\nBut I I think the the the best way is to uh get uhm through\nwhether it be professional assistance of not but I feel that the parents\nthemselves have ability to bridge that gap\n\n\nIt has to be both ways where the parents move toward the problem\nteenager and the teenager uh at least uh understanding their their needs to\nbe some compromise and they have to work towards each other\n\n<$A> \n\nIf they're given and yah given that okay uh a teenager who is\ngoing through a this kind of phase that's not uh sort of so called normal uhm\nis not likely to want to listen to his parents anyway or to any authority\nfigure\n\n\nUhm is it really realistic to say that we can help the teenager\nbridge the gap\n\n\nDo you think it's realistic\n\n<$C> \n\nI think yes uh I think teenagers are looking for someone who's\nwilling to listen to what they have to say rather than always have to listen\nto someone\n\n\nSo we need to realise the the the normal transitional experience of\na uh transitional stage of a teenager and realise that if someone is\nidentified as on the fringe then more so that young person needs a listening\near\n\n\nAnd I have found that through my work in Teen Challenge when the\nteenager realises that someone is willing to give their time to listen they\nare ready to pour out uh their dreams their ambitions\n\n\nIs not that they want to perform poorly in exams is just that why\nall the pressure sometimes why I heard one teenager said why should I get\nstraight As you know why must I be like so and so I wanna be myself\n\n<$A> \n\nRight so you're saying that really one should not treat\nproblem teens as different from other teenage problems\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$D> \n\nIn a certain sense I I think the start needs to come from the\nparents because usually they are the one who recognises the problem first and\nthey can learn how to cope and what like Sam says they should be prepared to\noffer their teens a listening ear and that's where you open up the\ncommunication\n\n\nBut very often you find that parents are very controlling they're\nnagging they are demanding and they expect their teens to listen to what they\nhave to say and that's final\n\n<$C> \n\nNow that's very interesting because almost one hundred per\ncent of all the teenagers we deal with uh indicate that they wish their\nparents won't nag at them\n\n\nYou know in some way not uh just by verbal nagging but they wish\nthat their parents would would be more listening than just\n\n<$D> \n\nmore understanding\n\n<$C> \n\nAh yah and display understanding rather than just tell them\n\n<$B> \n\nSo what you're saying is that the parent should be encouraged\nuh to take the youth through a process of analysing their problem and then\nthey can act as resource persons\n\n<$C> \n\nExactly yes\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd it is up to the youth themselves to make the decision as\nto\n\n<$C> \n\nExactly\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat solution is acceptable to them and be held responsible\nfor it\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$D> \n\nQuite often uh you find that uh parents are also too quick to\njudge\n\n\nUh they will say the friends that you go with are not very suitable\nand teens having friends they find their friends important and they find them\nthat is good\n\n\nUh so parents need to handle these issues sensitively\n\n<$A> \n\nYah what about okay what about a parent who has never uhm been\nable to communicate with his or her child has never had the experience of\ndeveloping that relationship what can that parent do\n\n\nIs it I mean is that sort of relationship beyond redemption\n\n\nWould you ever say that there are cases which are beyond redemption\n\n<$C> \n\nI don't uh state uh that there's there are cases beyond\nredemption because I've seen many parents get surprise at themselves uh that\nthey had the ability to actually work toward\n\n\nIt may not uh change uh overnight it's again gonna be another\nprocess of uh learning uh because suddenly they realise I don't understand my\nteenage daughter\n\n\nWhere where was I at all these while\n\n\nUh and uh then if they can look at that as an opportunity to grow\nwith their now teenage daughter uhm then uh it is possible because they can\nfind the resource within themselves\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay just very quickly as a final sort of comment from all of\nyou\n\n\nThere's this organisation in the States called Tough Love which\nhelps parents sort of take a stand with their teenagers and stick to it sort\nof lay down the law as it were\n\n\nUhm do you think something like that could work in Singapore Ngee\n\n<$D> \n\nUh it's very good approach but I don't think it is suited for\nour culture because what Tough Love advocates is a kind of taking a tough\nstand letting your kid face the consequences and letting your kid go \n\n\nParents are not ready for that and like Wah Khoon said their their\nkid is too precious\n\n<$C> \n\nI feel Tough Love uh only works on a very strong uh bond in\nin a relationship There has to be a strong bond because uh some of our\nteenagers in Singapore react at the slighest provocation\n\n<$B> \n\nI think I want to say uh a word on behalf of the parents\nParents are human beings they have fears and they are afraid that their\nteenagers would go astray and in the Singapore context a lot of the parents\nare very afraid that their children would neglect their studies and that will\nmar their future So therefore I feel that teenagers should uhm assure their\nparents and take constructive step to let their parents know in what way are\nthey taking measures and not to neglect their studies to take care of\nthemselves when they go out or when they're staying overnight so that the\nparents fears can be allayed", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "1540290c-ab46-471b-acb2-6e80c4cd71c8", "added":

major political shock I think so unlikely that there will be a huge drop\nin markets anywhere in the world\n\n\nWhat we are having a problem is is establishing how much into our\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nThe demand side isn't as good as the fact that cost are dropping\ntherefore by virtue of that earnings in various companies should gradually\ncontinue to improve\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't think the market has ignored them again I I must beg\nto differ you must remember that during this period Tokyo has gone on a free\nfall for sometime and the fact that the Singapore market has been able to\nhold up so very well during this period given the very close correlation\nbetween these two indices I think it's indicative of the fact that there is\nstrong buying out there\n\n\nUhm I I totally agree in this instance that there is beginning to\nhave less uh investment opportunities but I disagree in the sense that I see\nnineteen ninety-one as a transition year between a poor economy to a good\neconomy in ninety-three\n\n\nBut a year in which liquidity is going to grow but where the real\neconomy is unable to demand that money and there are basically only three\nopportunities bonds uhm stocks or commodities or cash I guess will be the\nother one\n\n\nBut uh as we said interest rates are falling as you've gotten your\nuh uh programme commodities are not particularly looking and that's very\nspeculative and I think there's going to be more and more driving back into\nthe equity markets\n\n\nActually the cautiousness of the market today is I think are\nconsidered very bullish factor because when it's when it turns around to\nbecome more positive uhm people are going stop buying\n\n<$B> \n\nAt present uh levels in the market what we'll see is fair\nvalue\n\n\nIf you look at historical factors comparing internationally the\nSingapore markets' P E is the same as the US market P E\n\n\nTraditionally Singapore market P E is rated higher we don't have\nthe problems of the US so obviously what people are expecting is that the US\nmarket will really turn out quite strongly after some consolidation\n\n\nIf that happens then that will be a kick for the Singapore market\n\n\nNow which sectors are looking good I think the construction sector\nwhich in the previous years has a very rough times is going to look very\ninteresting this time\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't think investors can I think investors have to take a\ndecision whether or not we are in this transition period\n\n\nIf they are they should either uhm go in heavily in the blue-chips\nand expect to ride it up both the ups and the down\n\n\nAlternatively they have to trade it\n\n\nThe second is a much more speculative approach\n\n\nHowever if we are right that this year is going to be a vintage\nyear for Singapore then it's a question of timing rather than of risk\n\n<$B> \n\nI feel the cursory investor can hatch some of his bet\n\n\nThere are around a few shares less than a handful in the market\nwhere the yield is actually better than the interest rate today\n\n\nI think if you buy those shares you won't go very far wrong\n\n\nNumber two I think in Malaysia now some shares have dropped so much\nthat they are offering very good two to three year type values\n\n\nIf you're looking at that go right it\n\n\nThe most conservative investor would keep some or quite a lot of\nmoney in some form of bond or cash and keep a small portion for trading in\nthe market and this would be stocks lower-priced stocks and warrants \n\n\n\n<$C> \n\nIn my uh speech in parliament that you have referred to I used\na very simple example comparing prices twenty years ago <unclear> word\n</unclear> and I show that in terms of basic commodity basic prices like food\nthe purchasing power of Singaporeans has more than able to keep pace uh with\nthe inflation\n\n\nOn the other hand in terms of big-ticket items like cars and a\nnicer home I think the price increase has in fact out-paced uh the purchasing\npower\n\n\nAnd increasingly for the younger and better educated Singaporeans\nthose affordability of big-ticket items are in fact being used by them to\ngauge the standard of living they are enjoying\n\n<$C> \n\nIn that sense yes\n\n<$C> \n\nWell I think the CPI is a very blunt instrument in the sense\nthat it uh collated all the statistical data of some many consumers they are\nprobably one point over million consumer in Singapore into one single digit\n\n\nSo as such I don't think we can really count on CPI to reflect the\nactual cost of giving increases for every Singaporean\n\n<$D> \n\nWell I think uh the CPI is a measure of average change change\nof prices so uh the the problem of course is the CPI is the most uh obvious\nindicator of price changes\n\n\nIt is not the only uh indictor of price changes there are several\nothers use by economist and so on\n\n\nBut yes so far as the CPI is concern uh I think it is worth noting\nthat the individual component which make up the CPI are release by the\nDepartment of Statistics and if we feel that the consumption pattern is\nsomewhat different it is uh quite possible for us to reconstruct our own\nprice-index\n\n\nFor instance uh a personal CPI something that would show my own\nchange in the uh my own change in the cost of living personally experience by\nme\n\n\nUh this has been done for the expatriate community the Singapore\nInternational Chamber of Commerce has constructed that\n\n\nSo several price indices of several CPI could actually be\nconstructed I think in Hong Kong they they actually publish a a several CPI\nthree or four types of CPI\n\n<$E> \n\nWell there's one that normally that stands out when you\ncompare Singapore CPI with say uh CPS in the region and that is that although\nwe are much more developed country the way that we get the food is\nsubstantially higher than that of say Indonesia uh which has about\nthirty-four per cent rate compared to Singapore's forty per cent or Malaysia\nthirty-six per cent gain\n\n<$E> \n\nYes one would expect Singapore as a more developed country to\nhave a smaller proportion of its con consumption basket weighted to its food\n\n\nMaybe as an explanation for that in amount the amount of cooked\nfood that Singaporeans eat but certainly that is one thing that stands out\nwhen someone observes the CPI\n\n<$E> \n\nWell the point is the CPI is that measure an enriched price\nlevel and I think these product changes and all that really come in at the\nfringes affecting maybe point seven or point eight per cent of of the weights\nused in the index\n\n\nSo I don't think it de detracts from the CPI measuring the average\nprice level\n\n<$C> \n\nI have a point that Dr Soon mention that in Hong Kong there\nare different category of CPI so would you say that in Singapore perhaps we\ncan partition the consumer into their income levels and since in Singapore\nmost people staying in HDB flats\n\n\nPerhaps we can look at the three- room flats and below the\nfour-room five-room and executive and private and construct a CPI\n\n<$D> \n\nWell consumption is possible to do that and I think\npractically is also possible so long as so long as we have the individual\ncomponents\n\n\nBut I think we mustn't lose track of the fact that the CPI is\ndesigned to be a measure of average price increases\n\n\nSo in that respect if you if you look if you track the movement of\nthe CPI with the GDP deflator which is often used to deflate the Gross\nDomestic Product to get the real economic growth uh you find that the CPI and\nthe GDP deflator in Singapore has been moving fairly closely together\n\n\nIn other words they show fairly similar trends the same with uh\nother price deflators such as personal consumption expenditure price deflator\n\n\nSo so as a measure of average change in price the CPI is perhaps a\nfairly decent indicator but when it comes to an individual or to a particular\nsegment of the population it is not so good because it's quite academic to me\nthat the CPI doesn't go up by by say it goes up by only three per cent but\nthe cost of petrol goes up or the cost of car goes up and I'm in the market\nfor car\n\n\nSo that to me maybe what is affecting my own perception of my\nwell-being\n\n<$E> \n\nWell the CPI and inflation derived from there is important in\nwage negotiations it's important in formulating policies\n\n\nSo certainly true those mechanisms through wages through policy\nresponses to inflation one could have quite a decisive impact on the economy\n\n\nFor instance my people assume that uh uh the government here uses\nthe exchange rate as an instrument to control inflation so whenever inflation\nshow signs of accelerating one assumes that the government will allow the\nSingapore dollar to appreciate and that's going to have an impact on our\ncompetitiveness and so on\n\n\nSo obviously it can have a major impact on the economy\n\n<$D> \n\nWell I think I would I would uh I would along with that\n\n\nI think we we must be quite careful with uh with in an\nindiscriminate uh criticism of the CPI and say that because the CPI doesn't\nanswer this particular question it doesn't address this particular issue\ntherefore there's something wrong with the CPI because if we talk about\neconomic indicators we can only use indicators which are design for the\npurpose for which it is uh to design to meet the purpose for which it is\ndesign\n\n\nSo for instance if we are interested in the problems or the impact\non the poor therefore we would go about to construct a price index on the on\nthe changes in the price of various commodities on how they would affect poo\nuh the the poor the living standard of the poor and so on and so forth \n\n\nSo there there could be a whole range of economic indictors that\none could decide So we must be very careful and say that because it doesn't\nmeet its purpose therefore we try to do away with it\n\n<$C> \n\nI have mention earlier perhaps it's better to construct a\nseries of CPIs where affecting the different household expenditure patterns\nand I have been talking using the various household living in the HDB estate\nas a measure to doing so If we can achieve that I think then general public\nwould have a better acceptance of what the CPI meant to them", "subdomain":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nOkay I think with that we can come to our studio guest Suresh\n\n\nI know you're raring to tell us your point of view as well\n\n\nOkay as a person who came up with the uh kiasu comic uh books and\nthe kiasu character what is your reaction to the calls so far\n\n<$B> \n\nWell first of all there were a couple of us that got together\nto do the book and I must say that uhm a comic book a kiasu comic book is not\na promotion of kiasuism\n\n\nOn the contrary it is suppose to make Singaporeans more aware of the\nkiasu behaviours and that was what sort of uh inspired us to do the book in\nthe first place\n\n\nWe're in the humour business and we tend to look on the lighter side\nof things\n\n\nIt is fine to say have a anti-kiasu campaign and we would probably\nsupport it but being people in the humour business we do it you know by\nlooking at the funny side of it\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay Agnes is there a down side to this funny side\n\n<$C> \n\nWell if they were to look at it the same way as Suresh and his\nco-writer which look at it is uhm looking at humour and that we should learn\nto laugh at ourselves I think there's nothing wrong with it\n\n\nHowever you find that uh depending on the maturity of the readers\nthen young children may think that well if that's the way of life in\nSingapore and if it is being uh publicised so why not and on the other hand\nof course with this uhm capitalisation by commercial firms of using Mr Kiasu\nto promote their goods I think it can sort <unclear> word </unclear> in a way\nbe blown out of uh view you see\n\n<$A> \n\nBut I mean wouldn't wouldn't you say that the use of humour to\nconvey messages even that uhm that are negative in this way that to\ndiscourage people from from emulating those that those personality traits\nit's always been done and I presume you are you are following that tradition\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I think uh people are bombarded with all kinds of messages\nespecially in Singapore campaign after campaign telling them what they should\ndo and what they shouldn't do\n\n\nSometimes it would be effective to use humour because a person gets\nentertained and in the process perhaps some of the messages get through\n\n\nBut if you were to tell him that he shouldn't do this and that he\ngets turned off and we think that we're probably uh more effective in getting\nthe anti-kiasu message across than promoting kiasuism\n\n<$A> \n\nAgnes would you say that that is uhm is there a cautionary\nnote to that\n\n\nI'm sure you wouldn't disagree with that by saying how <unclear>\nword </unclear> we wouldn't\n\n<$C> \n\nWell no I wouldn't\n\n\nWell as I said before you see you are trying to tell them not to be\nkiasu but you have no control over how they view it\n\n\nWill they be taking it as a lesson yes it's something we shouldn't\ndo or it's something that well it's something that we should emulate so\n\n<$B> \n\nI think we should uh sorry I think we should give credit to\nyoung people even children uh sometimes we tend to think that they get easily\ninfluenced by comics\n\n\nWe all grow up by watching Popeye the sailor and we haven't become\nstarted speaking like Popeye\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay okay thank you thank you very much I think with that\nwe've come to the end of this part of the discussion and it's clear that\nkiasu promotions are meant to allow us to laugh at ourselves at least that's\nthe intention and yes I think we we we need to do more of that but the\nproblem is are we celebrating a behaviour that's not that funny that selfish\ninconsiderate behaviour\n\n\nWell I know you're raring to tell us some of your own personal\nencounters okay the number to call is six nine one one three double zero\nthat's six nine one one three zero zero\n\n\nJust keep dialing that number we want to hear your experiences with\nthe kiasus after this break(Phone-in interviews)\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay I think with that we will come to our studio guests again\n\n\nThe the importance of drawing a distinction between qualities that\nare obviously bad okay like what we talked about so far and the good\nqualities like being diligent being hardworking being cautious\n\n\nDo you think this is important to make a distinction between the\ntwo\n\n<$C> \n\nOh yes as a matter of fact I think that uhm when we first coin\nthe word being kiasu is always very negative in terms of being greedy a\nselfish grabby so but when we try to link up that with competitiveness in\nterms of being prepared and being diligent I don't think it should be uhm\ncome under the same term as being kiasu\n\n\nInstead as a matter of fact it's a good strategy in terms of being\nprepared for any kind of challenges and that comes under the same strategies\nas shun zi ping fa\n\n\nSo I think we have to be very distinctive about what we called the\nkiasuism and what is being called being prepared in terms of some kind of\nworking strategies\n\n<$A> \n\nWould would you say that uh some Singaporeans are using this\nas a crutch as it were for lack of better way of putting it for their own\ninadequacies but blaming other people who are hardworking by calling them\nkiasu\n\n<$C> \n\nOh yes I would think so because as a matter of fact you find\nthat the people have been using the word kiasu so loosely I would say that we\nhave to think very carefully as what is their definition of kiasu because I\nthink that there could be ten different definitions for kiasu according to\nwhat the person wants\n\n<$A> \n\nYah talking about definitions Suresh did you take into account\nthis this this point when you came up with the books\n\n<$B> \n\nOur understanding of kiasu is someone who wants to win at all\ncost\n\n\nA person who works hard I'll give you an example perhaps the\nOlympic games Carl Lewis and Ben Johnson Karl Lewis wants to win\n\n\nPerhaps he trains twelve hours a day Ben Johnson also wants to win\nbut he uses an unfair method uses drugs\n\n\nThat is a kiasu you know a person who wants to win at all cost even\nunfair so if people can understand that difference I think a lot of these\nfears are quite unfounded\n\n<$A> \n\nBut do you feel that that difference comes through clearly\nwithout being ambiguous in your books\n\n<$B> \n\nIn our books\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUh we make a special effort to show whenever Mr Kiasu does\nsomething uh bad he pays for it\n\n\nYou see there's a situation where he tries to beat someone to it to\nto grab a taxi at the end of which he goes onto a lane gets run over by a\ntaxi\n\n\nThat's the kind of situations that we put into the book so you know\n\n<$A> \n\nLast comment from Agnes a cautionary note very quickly\n\n<$C> \n\nYes oh uh here I think that uh what Suresh is doing is is\nsomething very positive but I have one word to add and in the sense that uh\nbeing kiasu children will learn not just from just the comics alone but from\nthe behaviour of adults\n\n\nThat's what I'm very much afraid of because if adults felt that\nit's it's quite a a fair game to be kiasu the young children because not all\nof them will read the comics but they will observe the important adults\naround them and that's my greatest fear\n\n<$A> \n\nWords of wisdom really\n\n\nThank you very much\n\n\nThank you Suresh thank you Agnes\n\n<$C> \n\nThank you\n\n<$A> \n\nWell with that comment we can quite comfortably wrap up this\ndiscussion I think\n\n\nThank you panelists for joining me in the studio\n\n\nWell what can I say\n\n\nLooks like we are living in quite a miserable country plagued by\nselfish inconsiderate kiasus\n\n\nHey but is that really true\n\n\nIs kiasuism so rampant a trade that it is the hallmark of the\nSingaporean as suggested by some of us\n\n\nYes we are kiasu and we should do something about it but are not\nbeing a little too hard on ourselves sometimes\n\n\nWhy do we have to swing between we are number one breast beating uh\nto we are kiasu brow beating\n\n\nCome on let's give ourselves more credit\n\n\nWe do have our redeeming qualities and we're not really that\ndifferent from the people in other countries\n\n\nLet's not be so kiasu\n\n\nThank you for calling in and remember if it concerns you it\nconcerns us\n\n\nThis has been Talking Point \n\n\n\n<$D> \n\nAlright Doctor Chua you've just heard uhm from a few calls\n\n\nDo you think that that's a fair assessment that you know we\nstereotype people\n\n<$E> \n\nWell uhm I'm glad most of the callers justify that there is a\nmi <unclear> word </unclear> a small majority of pe <unclear> word </unclear>\nemployers who are uh abusing their maids\n\n\nBut uhm employers most employers are not stereotype neither are\nmaids\n\n\nUh there are good maids there are bad maids so we shall concentrate\non the bad maids\n\n\nUhm to stereotype I don't think it's a good uh point for a\ndiscussion because sometimes we have to recognise that maids if they are\npushed to the wall they have no other way but to uh react the way they do\n\n<$D> \n\nDoctor Chung do you agree with uhm Doctor Chua's assessment\n\n<$F> \n\nYes to an extent I feel that the whole issue of uh employer\nmaid relationship is actually quite complex because the <unclear> word\n</unclear> the relationship between the employer and employee is actually\nquite different from that of any other work situation\n\n\nWhen you hire a maid you're actually employing her to undertake\nhouse work and child care for example\n\n\nThese are actually very broad terms which can cover a wide\nmultitude of tasks for example and therefore <unclear> word </unclear> it is\ndifficult to draw parameters as to what exactly constitute the task that\nshould be done\n\n\nSo because of this there could be difficulties uh by interpreting\nwhat should be the parameters for her job\n\n\nI think additional another point to be made also is that in\nreference to a call that was made earlier on about how when you pay two fifty\nthen you expect to get that much service out of her\n\n\nIt it has got to be realised is and and this is a point that has\nbeen made by Doctor Nirmala PuruShotam who is research on the subject\n\n\nNow actually what is happening when you employ your maid is that\nyou actually moving from house work that was done for free by the woman of\nthe house that is the wife and the mother to now uhm work that you have to\npay for\n\n\nIn other words you're actually paying two hundred and fifty dollars\nand and more because if if you take in consideration board and lodgings where\npreviously it was serviced without a fee\n\n<$D> \n\nDoctor Chua do you think why do you think that kind of\nmentality arises I mean as a psychologist\n\n<$E> \n\nAbout uh employers abusing their maids\n\n<$D> \n\nNo about the fact that because we pay a certain amount of\nmoney we expect this kind of uhm service\n\n<$E> \n\nThat uhm there is a possibility uh possible uh explanation\nwhat we re generally referred to as transference uh theory whereby most\nemployers they're working in a working environment as an employees\n\n\nEmployers who are generally bad to them generally they like to take\nthis uh phenomena back home and transfer it to the employees which is their\nmaid\n\n\nUh but uh we have to recognise that employers work in a different\nenvironment maids work in another environment\n\n\nThe maids are most subservient to them rather than employee uhm\nemployers themselves who are employees in the work place so it's usually a\ntransference phenomena here \n\n<$D> \n\nUhm alright thank you Well we've just heard some different\nreasons as to why employers behave the way they do Do you agree We'll also\nlike to hear how you think we can deal with all this We're going for a break\nnow when we come back your responses", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a82abe18-00ba-4033-a61e-fa670308096e", "added":

because it's it's a very nice feeling to wake up in the morning\nyou know if you're the only one doing this because you're half crazy\n\n<$A> \n\nNice feeling Okay\n\n<$B> \n\nNice feeling I mean I think you have to be slightly different\nbreed\n\n<$A> \n\nI take your word for it\n\n\nKuna at twenty-one you know you have to train as hard for the for\nthe sprints\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nYou didn't have to scale walls right\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm no we I think we had to scale some fences and hills\nbecause\n\n<$A> \n\nYou did wow full of trespassers\n\n<$C> \n\nOn uh on uh on the weekends and public holidays the the track\nwould be closed and the there were several occasions when we had uhm I think\nhave words with the watchman but we we we got got by\n\n<$A> \n\nYou two had very different experiences\n\n\nUh you started very young you started uh much later\n\n\nUh what's the ideal age to start\n\n<$C> \n\nWell track and field they have to start uh being active from\nyoung\n\n<$A> \n\nHow young\n\n<$C> \n\nUh maybe even from twelve onwards so there is a systematic\ndevelopment in their youth\n\n\nAnd then as they get into their late teens they can start uhm being\na bit more serious about the training and then when they are in their\ntwenties then they're they are prepared to train hard\n\n<$A> \n\nIs there a a over the hill age\n\n<$C> \n\nAt I think maybe at one time we we thought wasn't enough over\nthe hill age but uhm I think some world class athletes are showing that it's\nnot true\n\n\nCarl Lewis is already thirty and he he's he he still runs uh twenty\nseconds for the two hundred metres which is you know fantastic\n\n<$B> \n\nA lot of sport is mind over matter\n\n\nUhm I think in in the last sort of twenty years people have\ndiscovered that uh the winners have it in their mind to win anyway\n\n\nThe the the power of the psyche over the body is something that uhm\nI think it's just has been really not been uh uhm utilised\n\n<$A> \n\nSo you must have the will right\n\n\nWhat about the talent\n\n<$B> \n\nI think like Kuna and and myself we were in in different ways\nspotted\n\n\nUhm I think you need to be recognised\n\n\nYou you may want to do something very desperately may want to be a\ntop ballet dancer for example uhm and if you don't have the aptitude then\nit's very difficult\n\n<$A> \n\nWell that's a good point\n\n\nI like to come back to this point after the commercial break how\nto get talent spotted\n\n\nIt may do me some good to know that\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's time for a short break we'll be back\n\n<$A> \n\nBefore the break Pat Chan was telling us about the need for\ninternal drive to become champions the need for talent and also the need to\nbe talent spotted\n\n\nPat how does one get talent spotted\n\n<$B> \n\nThere's one of those one of those things of uh being the\nright place at the right time most of time uh but to get talent spotted you\nalso have to have a a a real group talent scouts people are looking for\ntalent and maybe the trouble in Singapore is that there aren't they that many\npeople looking out\n\n<$C> \n\nNo I think this is where the school teachers come in isn't it\nuh because I think the the Physical Education teachers are better trained uhm\nand so they are in good position to uh spot talent\n\n<$A> \n\nAre they doing it\n\n<$C> \n\nUh yes I think they are doing it but I think much of our\ntalent is being wasted\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm talking about the system\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nIn what way\n\n<$C> \n\nYou need you need a very systematic development of these\nyouths\n\n\nUh but we are losing them at a very early age we are losing them\nat 'O' levels 'A' levels and then we're losing them at very crucial stages\nmaybe at when the boys go to NS and when uh they also go to university\n\n<$B> \n\nWe're not talent spotting either at at those crucial stages\nbecause if we can pull them out I'm not saying yes I'm not saying special\nprivileges but I'm saying that if you recognise somebody has the potential\nthey should be pulled out and put into special programmes otherwise you will\nnever get the champions\n\n\nUh we could be sitting here twenty years from now and still be\ndiscussing these things\n\n<$A> \n\nSo what can we do about it\n\n<$C> \n\nIn Singapore we cannot run away uh from the fact that they\nmust get these uh academic qualifications or uh or uh or career uh\nqualifications uhm because we are such a small country we the the the society\ncannot absorb people uh ex-champions and put them in in Vienna desk\n\n\nThey have to have some kind of qualifications\n\n<$B> \n\nNo they <unclear> word </unclear> they don't necessarily have\nto get those qualifications in the fields that we are accustomed to\n\n\nThey can be sent out to get uh uh you know either in sports\nmedicine or sport psychology or whatever it is and then we bring them back as\nspecialists and this is something we haven't done\n\n\nThey haven't had bursaries or scholarships to do that\n\n<$C> \n\nBut uh of course now we have uh the bursaries and\nscholarships\n\n\nUh I think in our time uh they were very far and few in between\nbut now there are uhm monies available scholarships are are available and it\nthe ball is now at the sportsmen's feet\n\n<$A> \n\nAre you sure of that\n\n<$C> \n\nBut yah I'm I'm quite sure of that in the last\n\n<$B> \n\nHow long have they had these things\n\n\nI mean how long have they have these bursaries and why haven't we\nseen real results\n\n<$C> \n\nI I think the last three or four years at the most but\n\n<$B> \n\nSo you're saying that this is very in <unclear> word\n</unclear> at the moment\n\n<$C> \n\nYes but yah it and so it is the the sportsmen now have to\nmake a choice uh uhm should I go on a scholarship uh what are the obligations\nah if I go on a overseas scholarship uh do I concentrate on my training for\nsports or do I concentrate on my university education\n\n<$A> \n\nBut you can do both can't you\n\n\nYou can slow down your academic training maybe take longer to get\na degree you maintain your your sporting\n\n<$C> \n\nWe we could that but if you're on a scholarship the\nexpectations are a we send you for three years you do it in three years and\ncome back please\n\n<$A> \n\nCan't we stretch out the scholarship\n\n<$C> \n\nAlready we we should do that\n\n\nBut then uh uh money is involved but uh maybe we can work out\nsomething like that\n\n\nBut we can't do that kind of stretching out in in the local scene\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy not\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy not\n\n<$C> \n\nI mean that's university uh uh policy isn't it now if if the\ncourse is three years you do it in three years you can't stretch it out\n\n<$B> \n\nWell this comes back to what I was saying\n\n<$C> \n\nOkay so maybe uh uh that's something that you know uh our\ntertiary institutions can think about\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I mean this this is the question uh do we have champions\nof any real real standard\n\n\nVery few and far between the uh I mean the answer is there if you\nwant to uh\n\n<$C> \n\nYou can make concession for these people\n\n<$B> \n\nYou have to\n\n\nEveryone has to\n\n\nI'm not saying that they're concessions but it's just being able\nto think a different way \n\n\nIt's not a concession I don't think any athlete wants to be\nthought of as a concession\n\n<$C> \n\nYes I I agree with you Pat yes Uhm uhm maybe in certain\nareas we need some government uh uh intervention maybe in the area of\nnational service uh some kind of arrangement has to be made there But there\nare many other areas where we can get uhm help and support\n\n<$A> \n\nName a few\n\n<$C> \n\nFor examp for example I I said we are losing them at their 'O'\nlevels 'A' levels Why Parents want their their children to do well in the 'O's\nand 'A's The the school can help them in that area", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nHi\n\n\nI'm Peter Lim and it's mother's day\n\n\nHi mom and all the other mothers out there happy mother's day\n\n\nIt's a happy coincidence that we're discussing men tonight\n\n\nAfter all all men come from women\n\n\nMen come in various guises\n\n\nThere's a gentleman the new man and remember the old brute\n\n\nThen there are those confuse guys who make the girls feel so sorry\nfor them\n\n\nSo what's it really like to be a man in Singapore today\n\n\nTake me for example\n\n\nAm I the typical male\n\n\nAre you the model man\n\n\nAnd if you're a woman what is it take you expect of your man the\nideal man\n\n\nTo help us define or redefine the Singapore man I have a fair\ndistribution in the studio tonight one woman and two man Let's get to know\nthem\n\n\nHi Janice it's good to see you again\n\n<$B> \n\nThanks\n\n<$A> \n\nWe used to work together\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nJanice you are a journalist a wife and mother\n\n\nSo I put it in the right order\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I think so No well\n\n<$A> \n\nMother first right\n\n<$B> \n\nAbsolutely\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd you are the columnist too\n\n\nDoctor Robert Balhetchet can I call you Bob\n\n<$C> \n\nYes certainly please do\n\n<$A> \n\nYou're a mor moral educationalist and like me a bachelor\n\n<$C> \n\nOh sorry I didn't realise I had company\n\n<$A> \n\nI've company too and Anthony you are a family therapist\nhusband and a father\n\n\nWelcome to the studio tonight\n\n\nWe're talking about men Singapore men and what society and women\nand men themselves expect of the Singapore male\n\n\nSo can I start with you\n\n\nYou must be expect on the men\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I hope not\n\n<$A> \n\nWell Janice you took a year's leave from work to look after\nyour son Ryan who is now three three years old right\n\n<$B> \n\nAlmost three\n\n<$A> \n\nBut why did you take twelve months away from work\n\n\nWhy not your husband\n\n<$B> \n\nA simplistic answer would be I suppose that's because I'm his\nmother and that's expected of me\n\n\nBut uhm I truly do feel that it is the woman's role to be the\nmother and as much as my husband loves our son and everything I think women\ndo give uhm women were meant to be mothers and there's a nurturing quality to\nwomen that perhaps uh I hope I don't get into trouble but perhaps doesn't\ncome as naturally to a man\n\n<$A> \n\nAnthony are you reassured to hear that\n\n<$D> \n\nI am not\n\n<$A> \n\nYou're not\n\n<$D> \n\nYa\n\n\nBecause one of the problems is that we sometimes do not let the man\nbecome a human being to allow that nurturing part of him to surface\n\n\nI think a man can also express this gentleness nurturing spirits\nand so on\n\n<$A> \n\nLet's let's try and get into the minds of some of the uh male\nviewers tonight\n\n\nBut how many do you think will agree with what Anthony said\n\n<$C> \n\nUh maybe not too many\n\n\nI've often said I'm not too sure whether it's process or\nsocialisation\n\n\nI tend to think it is\n\n\nBut I don't think too many men would uh for instance uh cry readily\nin public or in front of someone else wouldn't mind if I cry in private well\nI own up\n\n\nBut the whole\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat's the point of crying in I mean\n\n<$C> \n\nYa but uh you know out of sheer sorrow for instance let's say\nthey they lost their wife or lost their mother they cry out of sheer grief\nyou know uh but they jolly well make sure that nobody's around to see that\nbecause they'd feel that that that's being soft you know\n\n\nUhm I think that's the mentality of most men and believe me they're\nprobably brought up like that\n\n\nI don't blame the men\n\n<$A> \n\nSo you blame the mothers do you\n\n<$C> \n\nI think so in a sense because uh you you you see this with\nwith every mother\n\n\nIf a kid falls down and uh if it happens to your boy and he yells\nand cries the mother picks him up and say come on you're a big boy boys don't\ncry\n\n\nOh that that is being told to the chap from very young\n\n\nIf a girl falls down and cry then no problem\n\n\nSayang the chap you know it's it's it's kind of natural you know\n\n\nI remember being told that many many times when I was a little kid\n\n\nBoys don't cry\n\n\nYou're a big boy now you don't cry so you know you you you grow\nwith the mentality I mustn't cry\n\n<$D> \n\nAnd I agree with Bob here you see\n\n\nThere's a reality that we define men in a certain way women in a\ncertain way\n\n\nAnd in that sense we limit the men they say\n\n\nIn my therapy room we find men having that privacy that uh\npermissional most you know to express their emotions when in pain due to\n\n<$A> \n\nThey do or they don't\n\n<$D> \n\nThey do they do due to difficulties in life or or problem with\nrelationship and I see a lot of man crying you know\nICE-SIN:#> So it's it's like so sad you know that you you you have to pay somebody\nfor an opportunity to cry\n\n\nI mean wouldn't he be better if he brought up to to to be permitted\nto express emotions and perhaps express them appropriately too so that we do\nnot get some men who have difficulty expressing emotions and then they end up\nwith a lot of aggressive feelings and some of them then end up beating up\ntheir wives or hammering things or killing themselves or you know bestrewn\nthings altogether\n\n\nI think I they be allowed to to get in touch with this part of\nthemselves\n\n<$A> \n\nSociety now says Singapore at least that men must change right\nand the the then Prime Minister in uh July 1990 says that uh new attitudes\nhave to change if Singapore women are to successfully juggle their roles at\nhome and at work\n\n\nSo society is demanding that Bob\n\n\nAre the men responding or are they getting more confused or more\nreactionary\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm I guess it's a bit difficult to answer that outright in\nterms of uh equality lie for instance equal pay and treatment and that sort\nof thing everything else being equal\n\n\nUh then I think you know that's that that much change I suppose if\nit adds to a large extent but there must be some areas which are you know\nthere is still that kind of a differentiation\n\n\nBut on the other hand uhm I would think it'd be totally unnecessary\nI wouldn't want men to change uh in terms of uh the niceties that he shows to\na to a lady etceteras etceteras etceteras you know\n\n\nUhm I've been accused of being male chauvinist because I open doors\nfor ladies\n\n\nUhm because it seems that's an indication that I consider the other\nsex\n\n<$B> \n\nWeak\n\n<$C> \n\nI don't know weaker and\n\n<$B> \n\nThey can't open their own doors\n\n<$A> \n\nSo do you still do it\n\n<$C> \n\nAbsolutely and I think will absolutely defend and when I teach\ncourtesy to to kids that I teach them to do it uhm because I think it's nice\n\n<$A> \n\nI've been told to stop doing it\n\n<$C> \n\nSorry\n\n<$A> \n\nI've been told to stop doing it\n\n<$C> \n\nYes so have I\n\n\nI was told that in public in in a discussion once you know that I\nwas being chauvinist\n\n\nI said what carry on but I like being chauvinist and somehow or\nrather the female friends I mix with seem to like my chauvinism in that area\nat least you know\n\n<$A> \n\nJanice\n\n<$B> \n\nWhich is how I feel actually men are quite confused you know\n\n\nUhm on the one hand they're expected to now be sensitive and\nemotional and those are very good I mean those are the things that keep a\nrelationship alive\n\n\nAt the same time the woman also I think I think if if if I can be\nused as an example I'm just your average woman right we also want the men to\nremain protective\n\n\nWe also want the maleness you know of the men to come through so\nwhile I want him to learn to share his emotions with me to learn to to to\nnurturing and everything uhm I think I also have a responsibility to in\nteaching him how to bring it out because you can't just say the man has to\nchange full stop and I am a woman and I demand this\n\n\nI know I depend on my husband for all the practical things in life\n\n\nUhm he depends on me for the emotional support that I can give you\nknow so it's it's a partnership lah you know\n\n<$D> \n\nI I come to think in the sense it's sad lah you know\n\n\nI don't think we should just focus on men's changing you know\nbecause men has to change in relation to something and it's in realism to the\nchanging expectations of women as well of <unclear> word </unclear> even\nother men\n\n\nSo I I agree with you in that sense I mean it has to be something\nmutual and I also agree that there is this confusion that is setting because\nwith all the demands of men to change sometimes the man is not quite sure as\nto what he ought to be you see at the end of the day and that may add to the\nconfusion I suppose\n\n<$A> \n\nBut do you personally feel confused\n\n\nDo you or do you what you should be\n\n<$D> \n\nI suppose I suppose that there's some point you can be\nbecause then you ask yourself what do they want you see\n\n\nSo you're you're told for example okay you you you you must let\nthe woman be more than that you know passive uh submissive person so you let\nher be okay but then the next moment you stand back and you refuse to open\nthe door for her for example and then she just much in\n\n\nThen then you get the snag remark that you don't want to wait for\nme first you know open the door\n\n<$B> \n\nI think there's a different issue between chauvinism and\ngallantry\n\n<$D> \n\nThere's some confusion\n\n\nI'm I'm just it's a maybe a silly minor example but but there's a\nbit of confusion there\n\n\nSo likewise with other areas to in just with what Janice is saying\n\n\nYou know what we're talking about letting the men express emotions\nsome women cannot handle that because the moment you see that coming out from\nthe man you think he's being less than a man when like I said before you said\nit's actually being more human you see\n\n\nSo that may lead to the confusion\n\n<$A> \n\nWell we talked about uh different demands on men which are\ncausing confusion among men and you you of all people I'm surprise to hear\nthat you too are a bit confused\n\n\nUh you mentioned maleness and after the break I'll like to ask you\nto elaborate on that\n\n\nIt's time for a commercial break we'll be back\n\n<$A> \n\nBefore the break we are talking about how confused we poor\nmen are\n\n\nBob and I have two things in common at least\n\n\nWe're both bachelors and both of us have been scolded by women for\nopening car doors and other doors for them\n\n\nAnthony in the other hand have has seen men being scolded for not\nopening doors for women\n\n\nSo Janice what do you women want\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know\n\n\nUhm I think women want a balance and I think there's a difference\nbetween chauvinism and just plain politeness or gallantry old world chunk and\nI think if you if women want to bring it down to something as ridiculous as\ndon't open the door for me because I'm macho enough to open my own door then\nit's I think bringing things to the extreme\n\n<$A> \n\nBut there are different there're women with different\nattitudes right\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nSo you represent\n\n<$B> \n\nThe middle ground\n\n<$A> \n\nMiddle ground\n\n<$B> \n\nI enjoy being a woman\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay \n\n<$B> \n\nBut that doesn't mean I enjoy being trampled on by the men\nThere are certain roles I think of the men has to play just as there are\ncertain roles that a woman plays is just you know it's just the way of the\nworld right And which is not so that if he cries he's being less of a man but\nthere are certain things a certain take chargeness uhm a woman I think must\nfeel that she can depend on her man you know not to fall to pieces in a\ncrisis to be able to make decisions for the family if they cannot reach some\nSomebody has to you know to to to be a leader to be to be the person that you\ncan depend on He is the person that uhm there's certain male attributes that\nhe should have lah you know\n\n<$A> \n\nIs it\n\n<$D> \n\nThat's that's not necessary that's not necessary being male\nyou know I think I think it is\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd apart from that is it unfair burden to the poor guy\n\n<$D> \n\nPrecisely precisely you see So why should the man be\nburdened with all these responsibilities\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause the wife has to take care of the running of the\nhousehold so that <unclear> word </unclear> him to\n\n<$D> \n\nBut the man the man the man the man is also changing and and\nwhy can't the man uh woman be the provider as well so that the man can make a\nchange too He can do other things that he wants to because if you do not\nallow the man to do that then you get to a position where the woman have\nchoices you see she can decide that this is what I like to do I like to be a\nfull-time mother I like to be part-time mother I like to be full-time worker\noutside I like to do this or that But the man has no choice virtually he has\nall the responsibilities of being the provider the decision-maker the take\ncharge person you know <unclear> word </unclear> can't even out\n\n<$B> \n\nNo no no I'm saying when it comes to the crunch you know\nsomebody must\n\n<$D> \n\nWhy can't it be the woman\n\n<$B> \n\nIf the woman can make up her mind Sure you\n\n<$D> \n\nWhy why not I mean as a man I'll like the woman to do that\ntoo so that in a sense we then you know allow for this interchangibility\nbecause I these are not necessary static roles you see I mean and they can be\nflexible and there can be interchangibility between the man and the woman", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nI think it's true that uh in the market there is general\nperception that the prices may begin to to move down and the I think this\nperception is uh due to too many expectations\n\n\nOne is that there seems to be coming on-stream over supply of uh\nresidential property and secondly there seems to be a consensus that the\neconomy may be weakening\n\n\nMy own opinion is that uh the market will probably be stable for at\nleast a few more months after which uh it may begin to ease but not very much\n\n\n\nMartin \n\n<$A> \n\nPerhaps uh five per cent which is what I said before uh\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I think uhm basically uhm everybody is now on the side\nlines waiting and personally I think the property market is really toppish\nbecause I think uh if you look between 1985 and now the prices have gone up\nprobably close to three times so the I I believe the upside potential is\nlimited and I think the prices should come down as uh Dr Amos said five to\nten per cent\n\n<$C> \n\nWell uhm from historical record in fact we have seen that the\nrate of increase in prices have started to drop since about end of 89 so even\nthough there is an increase over all these months the rate of increase has\nbeen dropping so that seem to suggest that we are also heading also for\ndownward uh uh movement of the price \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$C> \n\nI think well it's anybody's guess\n\n\nIt could be five\n\n\nIt could be ten\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I have a different opinion from all the other three\n\n\nUh we are more bullish uhm having crunched our numbers we realise\nthat yes prices have gone up considerably since 1985 or 86 but then at the\nsame time so has uhm income of Singaporeans uhm so the actual affordability\nhas actually improved\n\n\nUhm the other factors to consider would be the fall in interest\nrates here\n\n\nAgainst that you've got relatively higher yield on rental of say\ncondominium apartments and there's also foreign factor\n\n\nYou've mentioned Hong Kongers but uh I think there's another factor\nto consider which is the shortage of local professionals in the work force\nhere which means that there'll be a continued strong influx of expatriates to\nmeet that short fall \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$B> \n\nYes I'm bullish \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$B> \n\nI think prices will remain at current levels for say another\nfour to six months and there after people will start to come back again\nbecause the longer prospective buyers prospective cash-up buyers wait the\nmore anxious they are about possibly missing the bottom of the market \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$B> \n\nYes I think he is very optimistic\n\n\nUhm basically he mentioned about the increase in income\n\n\nWell uh I think if you look at the increase in income versus the\nincrease in property prices over the last five years uhm you know as I\nmentioned property prices have gone up by more than three times but certainty\nincome didn't go up in terms of in that proportion so uhm uhm I think he is\npretty optimistic\n\n\n\n\nWell but the other factor to consider is capital gains from those\nwho are now in public housing\n\n\nIf you have bought a say five-room HDB flat five years ago at\naround five years ago at around hundred thousand dollars today you could sell\nit for easily two hundred thousand dollars\n\n\nSo with that and the uh increase in income in salaries since then\nmost couples should be able let's say a significant number of uh household in\npublic housing would be able to upgrade to private \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$A> \n\nUh I think I have to to step back a bit\nICE-SIN:#> Uh assuming that we are at the peak it doesn't mean that the this is not\nthe a good time to buy\n\n\nUh generally speaking prices are expected to move down uh later\npart of the year\n\n\nBut uh assuming that you are careful in your choice of property uh\nif you buy at the peak a very good quality property in a good location uhm\nfrom historical trends we have seen that actually although the property\nmarket moves in cycles uh every cycle is higher than the than the previous\n\n\nAnd if you buy at the peak and you are willing to have a longer\nterm investment horizon to hold on uh to say around the next peak\n\n\nUh in fact historically we have found that the rate of growth for\ncapital appreciation has been quite good you have six seven per cent \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$A> \n\nWe are basing uh our projections mainly on the possible supply\nsituation\n\n\nIn fact we agree with Yew Boon that the demand is strong but the\nprice being quite high tends to dampen demand because uh it acts as a ceiling\nfrom people's perception\n\n\nBut uh supply is still a very fundamental uh component uh of of of\nfactor of price and looking at uhm landed property as compared with\ncondominiums the supply for condominium would be we estimate for the next two\nor three years about thirty per cent or above say thirty to forty per cent\nover supply compared to landed property of about fifteen to thirty per cent\n\n\nSo looking at this just from the supply point of view there seems\nto be uh perhaps a greater amount of oversupply for apartments and therefore\nthere maybe a greater down side for apartments compared to landed property\n\n\n\nMartin \n\n<$A> \n\nUhm well now it's it's uh let's let's look at the question\nfrom the point of view of uh uh growth right\n\n\nUh I was saying that the the the long-term trend is one of a growth\nin the property prices so if you if you are willing to hold long-term then\nyou could say that even at the the peak it is not the wrong time to buy\nprovided you are very careful in choosing good quality property alright\n\n\nOn the other hand you say let's let's wait until it slides ten\nfifteen or even twenty per cent or let me wait wait until the market is down\nbut we know generally that it is when the market is high that you do get\npeople selling good property in good locality this which are perhaps with uh\nwell secured tenants and if you wait for say the bottom of the market now you\nmay be scrapping the bottom barrel \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$B> \n\nWell uhm I would say it depends on the type of properties that\nyou are looking at\n\n\nCertainly I think apartments you know I feel that uhm there is a\npotential that it may come down so uhm if you have a pro just now you were\nmentioning about the the guy wanting to buy the property when to buy and when\nnot to buy it really depends on your time horizon as as uh Dr Amos said you\nknow\n\n\nThe other thing is uhm in terms of upgrading if you're buying it\nfor your own owner occupation then you know the timing is less important\n\n\nBecause if you were to wait for the down turn you know you maybe\nnever be able to get the property that you like\n\n\nSo it really depends on your own personal what you think and the\nother thing that is very important is your cash flow you know whether your\nmonthly income is able to service the kind of properties that you are buying\nat \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$B> \n\nYah I think so \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$A> \n\nFor investment meaning that you want to buy to let out\n\n\nAt the same time perhaps in a few year's time to sell for capital\ngain\n\n\nUh for budget say uhm HDB homeowner possibly if you have budget of\nsay four hundred to five hundred thousand you'll be good to look at uh\npreferably uh prime districts which we we know nine ten eleven and in fact\nperhaps fifteen too because these are the areas which are preferred by\nexpatriate management uh staff who require housing and they uh go for these\nareas and the rentals that you can get probably would would be quite like\nseven per cent yield\n\n\nUh advertisement at ten per cent yield seems to be really too\nperhaps exaggerated \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$A> \n\nOutside prime if you think for investment uh well uhm you may\nget a yield of six per cent which is not bad uhm but the there is perhaps a a\nlittle more difficulty in letting out\n\n<$C> \n\nI think if we look at the uh figures you would see that prices\nare actually becoming quite uh similar in various district outside the prime\narea and this trend will go on as the uh island decentralised in its\ndevelopment pattern So in a sense there's really a wide range of districts\nand areas to buy into\n\n\nWhat is probably more important for Mr Lim would be to uh make a\nvery careful assessment of his personal needs the needs of the households\nperhaps accessibility to uh places or place of work uh the schools uh schools\nfor the children and so on\n\n\nSo that would be more important \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$B> \n\nWell certainly for investments we look at two things\n\n\nOne is the rental and one you know is the capital appreciation\n\n\nWell uhm I think in terms of investments if you are buying a\nproperty for investments location is very important uhm location is the\nimportant thing that you should be looking at because in terms of\nappreciation when the market goes up they are the ones to go up fastest and\nwhen the when the market they are the the ones to come down fastest\n\n\nAnd in terms of rentals I think you can get much better rentals and\nmuch better sup uh demand by the expatriates\n\n\nSo I would say that if you are buying a property for investments\nyou should look for prime location uh res uhm apartments \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$B> \n\nYes I think so because if you are buying houses let's say for\nexample in this particular person he's he's living in HDB he could opt for a\nterrace for example because I think like a terrace or semi-detached the\nprices have gone up much less than would the uh the condos\n\n\nUh in terms of the price increase I think the the uhm the landed\nproperties have gone up probably about thirty to fifty per cent compared to\ncondos which have gone up about three times so I think in terms of the\npotential for capital appreciation\n\n\nCertainly I think landed property is a better bet but again you\nknow it depends on your own personal preference \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$B> \n\nI think until the uhm government particular the CPF changes\nits uh regulations uh the leasehold property would be a safer bet because uhm\nsorry freehold property I guess uh you know leasehold property uh I think\nafter ten or or twenty years up to close to twenty years the property uh the\ncapital appreciation potential isn't quite there\n\n<$C> \n\nBut I think there is a psychological factor at at work because\nI think we still very much like to own a piece of the turf in Singapore and\nif you look at the new uh supply coming onto the market that is in private\nhousing than we have almost two-third of it in the form of uh medium price\nterrace houses\n\n\nBut that obviously uh tells you that both the public sector as well\nas the pri pri private sector is targeting that particular segment of the\nmarket\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I think if you have half a million you can easily buy in\na terrace in a uhm not so prime location uhm and uh I think you can also you\ncan also buy a small apartment if you want to so uhm there is still market if\nyou have a half million there is still a supply of such properties in the\nmarket \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$B> \n\nThe only the the the only I think uhm semi-detached have gone\nbeyond half a million except for really off-side locations or very old\nproperties so I think it is really beyond the reach if you have half a\nmillion for semi-detached \n\n\nMartin\n\n<$B> \n\nWell uhm we look at properties quite differently from the\nreal-estate valuers because uhm we look we we deal a lot with customers so we\nknow roughly the transactions that are going around We also look at what we\nthink the uh longer term uh market is so taking things into considerations\nmost of the time we would have taken the purchase and said that uh compared\nto say you know transactions that were going around in the last uh two three\ndays or two three months and we would feel we would know that whether that is\na good price or not", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "1308e355-b1d7-4bd7-81e8-c0667e7e7e74", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nI think we should not start with by comparing with far larger\ncountries with with far greater resources\n\n\nIt's always a matter at the end of whether you finally make the\nprofit so these are the first steps and of course there will be failures\nthere are going to be many more failures but we should not be deterred by it\n\n\nBut I was going to come back to Mr Onmae's point that uh we should\nconcentrate on services which of course I think is an area that we should be\nin fact uh focus on but I do dispute the point that in manufacturing industry\nwe are not competitive\n\n\nIn all manufacturing industries if you if you try to uh examine\nvarious facets of it there are areas in which Singapore will be competitive\n\n\n\nMartin \n\n<$A> \n\nI think selling out is not the uh right point here\n\n\nI think it's getting yourself a mesh or getting yourself a a group\ninto a bigger base to go into the global market because going global is uh\nnot something that simple\n\n\nAs uh what uh Kent said earlier that Singapore can put itself uh\ntogether with the whole region as the capital city but the problem here is we\nhave still this border despite what we talk about\n\n\nThe borderless world nations are still nations so there are still\nbarriers\n\n\nBut the day might might come as we talk about the free trade uh\narea where Singapore could actually be the capital and as what Wee Hock said\nearlier the infrastructure and all the pluses that we have could be made use\nof uh to our benefit\n\n\nSo for Singapore companies when we team up with larger uh companies\nor when you seek the path of a a listing for instance to get more capital is\nto equip ourselves for globalisation\n\n\nSo when you companies uh teaming up or uh selling out to bigger uh\ngroup is because of the products that they have that they are ready to\nglobalise and you need to take that path \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$B> \n\nYah I I I tend to agree with Dr Onmae that you know there is a\nneed to emphasize the other aspects rather than pure manufacturing\n\n\nIf you look at Singapore's history where have been good\n\n\nWhere have we been strong\n\n\nWe are good traders we are good builders of domestic we have built\na very good lifestyle for ourselves\n\n\nWe are good infrastructural people No reason why we shouldn't\ncontinue to do these things but I think the more important thing is to\nemphasize that we are a city state\n\n\nWe are not a nation in a sense of a nation having lots of\nhinterland lots of resources we don't have that\n\n\nWe need to compete therefore in narrower areas\n\n\nI don't like the word globalisation\n\n\nI think that's too big a word but I would be very happy say one of\nour newspapers acquired one of the Maxwell group newspaper tomorrow\n\n\nAnd there's no reason in the world why we shouldn't think about\ndoing that kind of work\n\n<$A> \n\nI think Singaporean within our culture there are certain\nproducts that can still be globalised\n\n\nI don't see why McDonalds should be McDonalds and pizza should be\nthe only globalised food products\n\n\nChinese food noddles uh paos and uh even Peking ducks uh Singapore\nfood industry has gone into the roasting of ducks for Singaporeans\n\n\nLet's hope that they go abroad and sell it you know to the Russians\n\n\nLots of hungry stomachs out there \n\n\nMartin Dr Onmae Martin \n\n<$B> \n\nI I think it's a paradox about it in the sense that uh we've\nbeen around as a nation in a sense with a free independent identity for about\ntwenty odd years\n\n\nTherefore we cling to this need to keep our individualism we keep\ntalking about our ethnic roots\n\n\nBut the other point that I think that Dr Onmae is getting at which\nis perhaps more important is that we are a city we are competitive with many\nother cities in the world\n\n\nTo do that you begin to move into I suppose this word globalisation\nwhere our bankers for instance some of our bankers among the best bankers in\nthe world\n\n\nOne of the world's top traders in foreign exchange resides in\nSingapore is a Singaporean\n\n\nWe have got good accountants\n\n\nWe've got good lawyers\n\n\nWhat we have to do then is to draw the line and say what is needed\nto keep our identity as Singaporean\n\n\nI think our Prime Minister mentioned you know 'char kway teow'\nmight be the emphasis to what makes us feel Singaporean\n\n\nWe need to draw the line between what is Singaporean and what is\nthe need to keep us competitive as a global city\n\n\nThe more we develop this idea of a mobile international urban elite\nwhere people move in and out across countries the more we will capture good\npeople coming to Singapore\n\n\nAnd no reason why a a good film director might not one day come to\nSingapore because he likes the lifestyle here and uses this as a base from\nwhich to do his business for the a marketing man \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$A> \n\nI would advise you when you want to globalise to go into that\ncountry and hire a bright young guy there who will probably be cheaper and I\ncan still achieve my objective as an entrepreneur \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$A> \n\nNot necessarily within a globalise country and a globalise\nstate come people work for for international companies people work for for\nsalary for <unclear> word </unclear> for career goals and so on so long as\nyou manage him properly\n\n\nAnd there are companies in Singapore who have got a lot of offices\nand operations abroad who hire the locals\n\n\nNothing wrong with that\n\n<$B> \n\nI think there's nothing wrong with that except that we want to\ngive our younger executives more exposure abroad so that hopefully they in\ntime to come may lead other companies may break out on their own\n\n\nAnd perhaps this is where the contacts of name national values\nagainst international competition comes into play\n\n\nPartly our Singaporeans feel comfortable in Singapore but the the\ncommon problem that is being state stated is the issue of say things like\nbilingualism\n\n\nIf my child must learn Mandarin if I am posted to China I suppose\nthat's not a problem or Taiwan but if I were to be posted somewhere else and\nif my child doesn't pick up enough Mandarin then there could be very serious\nfor his future I suppose\n\n\nSo I think we have to make a trade-off here in Singapore\n\n\nI'm not say that by by reason of this we should give up\nbilingualism \n\n\nMartin Dr Onmae Martin \n\n<$B> \n\nI'll like to raise a point that you know for instance our\nstudents who go to a country like say the States they do very well there and\nalso many Singaporeans do move outside Singapore\n\n\nI think your generalisation might be for country as a whole but if\nyou think of Singapore as a city with clusters of people I think we can make\nour executives move a lot out of Singapore\n\n\nThe policy is less orientated towards elements such as say the\neducational issue which is linked with national values\n\n\nSo I I believe that there are many opportunities for Singaporeans\nto go abroad and that they can survive in the tough competitive world\n\n\nMany of our bankers have lived outside and they have done quite\nwell when they went out \n\n\nDr Onmae Martin \n\n<$C> \n\nI think finding the money is one thing the the thing to look\nat might be that you are talking about two groups of uh business\n\n\nOne is for starters so for starters probably you really need seed\nmoney where the risk is higher\n\n\nThe other group will be for what you said about the 'pao' uh\nsellers who has already a business going has proven some success and wants to\nfirst regionalise\n\n\nSo I think that group is where the venture capitals should come in\nand the at the current state they don't take such big risk probably to look\nat it and take a bigger risk and actually help them out uh via a packaging a\nfranchise road\n\n\nUh that would might involve uh lesser capital\n\n\nOr actually finding them a business partner\n\n\nAnd I think the thing for Singapore businesses to do now is\nprobably to look at alliances look at grouping themselves together and then\nthe seeking the market out because the market place outside is not uh as\nsimple as what Kent said earlier during the Japanese days where they could uh\nsell a poorer or more inferior product because the market place at that time\nis freer\n\n\nThe uh market demands for the goods are much larger than today\n\n\nToday the competition is different so we should look at Singapore\nnow going into the next lap\n\n\nThe first twenty-five years is pretty simple \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$C> \n\nOh during our times as I have said earlier in the early\nseventies we started in seventy-one the demand is greater than supply and you\njust need to work a little harder\n\n\nOpportunities were plenty Today the situation is different\n\n\nAt that point in time to start a capital you need to start a\nbusiness you need very low capital\n\n\nYou could actually pass your hat around and get started\n\n\nToday you're talking about millions of dollars\n\n\nWe started off with uh only twenty thousand dollars\n\n\nSo it's a different ball game so we could see that opportunities\nare no more the same\n\n\nThe uh stage of uh development is totally different now\n\n\nI agree with Kent we are such a small population base hardly three\nmillion so we cannot be champions in everything\n\n\nSo maybe \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$A> \n\nWell I I think the test of an entrepreneur is finally his\nability to find the money\n\n\nSure bankers have to be conservative\n\n\nI think that and stock exchange have got to abide by its own rules\n\n\nAnd sure it's going to be very difficult you know\n\n\nBut the poor pao maker just have to keep on going around passing\nhis hats and badgering his relatives and looking for companies to buy-out\nsell-in or whatever\n\n<$C> \n\nI I uh agree with Wee Hock because at the end of the day the\nbusinessman must find his own market must find his own business\n\n\nBut can we as a small state make it easier make it uh create the\nopportunities create the avenues so if I was talking earlier you have this\npeople with bright ideas university students who come out with fantastic\nprojects so entrepreneur in the making\n\n\nNow where do they go\n\n\nSo maybe in in the Singapore's context we have to look for\nalternative\n\n\nMaybe the setting up of an entrepreneurship fund might be useful\n\n\n\nMartin \n\n<$C> \n\nWell when if we have a group or or a individual who has an\nidea and feel that he could sell coming to this uh committee that's managing\na fund for instance \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$A> \n\nCan can I just cut in because uh within the EDB during my time\nwe had a lot of experience trying to set up funds hundred million dollar two\nhundred million dollar\n\n\nThe problem is always administering it who do you give to the\ncriterias and the risk of failures\n\n\nI think it should be Singapore as a group or the government or the\nEDB or whoever should provide the necessary incentives to overcome not to\novercome the risk but to make the risk worth taking\n\n\nSo some incentives must come for globalisation\n\n\nOne particular one will be to implement maybe a a reverse tax\nincentive ten years\n\n\nSince we give ten year pioneer status for companies to come here\nwhy not give ten year pioneer status to companies who go abroad\n\n\nIf they are taxed abroad then that tax should be deductable\nagainst local <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nIt's a reverse pioneer status \n\n\nDr Onmae Martin \n\n<$B> \n\nI think that uh the attitude towards failure doesn't\n\n\nSorry I think Kent's trying to come in \n\n\nDr Onmae Martin\n\n<$B> \n\nI think he's got a point The point is that uh for Singapore\nto grow bigger and the government having played a very large role in\nSingapore you'll find that the more you want to go into the international\ncompetitive area the smaller the role the the government plays or should play\nor should be playing and maybe this is an important consideration We have\ndeveloped a host lieu of government-linked companies", "subdomain":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nI think I agree with Dr Thurow that uhm entrepreneurship isn't\nis to a certain degree I think irrelevant to discussion of the Singapore\neconomy\n\n\nUhm I think what we need really is not so much more talk about\nentrepreneurship per se\n\n\nI don't think you can actually legislate entrepreneurship\n\n\nYou can't uh bring it about with more management programmes\n\n\nUh I think what we need more is to talk about whether in the next\nlap we will have the kind of creativity the crine of kind of independent\nthinking that uh the whole population needs to achieve\n\n\nIf we are going to achieve the next lap and if that is the case I\nthink entrepreneurs will will come out and uh the MNCs will also benefit\nbetter so I'm not too sure whether by focussing on whether entrepreneurship\nis dead or alive\n\n\nWe are really focussing on whether the economy is going to do better\nor not \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$A> \n\nWell I think we need more creative thinking in the next lap\n\n\nWhether the creative thinkers are going to be entrepreneurs or\nworking in MNCs I think we need more of that in the next lap because in the\nnext lap with more emphasis on brain services\n\n\nIf the type of people we're going to have in Singapore are are not\ngoing to be more creative in their thinking then they're not even going to do\nwell in MNCs \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$B> \n\nWell uhm yes I think Singapore do need entrepreneurs\n\n\nAnd uhm if you want to be an entrepreneur you ask yourself or let's\nsay you have an idea and you say well I decide that uh I don't want to work\nfor MNCs anymore and that I want to be my own boss\n\n\nUh is that the only reason you want to be an entrepreneur ask\nyourself\n\n\nUhm if the reason is that uh perhaps you want to uhm have greater\nfreedom okay as some people do or perhaps you want to see the result of your\nown achievement in terms of seeing the growth of the company that you set up\nor you would want to uhm have recognition uhm there are number of reasons or\nperhaps you want to be very rich one of these days okay \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$B> \n\nWell if you become an entrepreneur or try to become an\nentrepreneur because it's glamourous or because everybody else seems to be\ndoing it I think that's the reason to be to be one\n\n\nUhm perhaps you are not so focussed\n\n\nThat's that's quite important to be quite focussed in what you want\nto do \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$A> \n\nYah I think you have state entrepreneurship already existing\nvery much in Singapore \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$A> \n\nWhat if you have to ask yourself whether you are needed in\nconsidering whether you you want to be an entrepreneur or not than I think\nyou shouldn't be an entrepreneur to begin with \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$A> \n\nI think there's room for you in the domestic economy\n\n\nI think Singapore is a tracheotomized economy you've got the MNC\nsector you've got the large uh government link companies and the large public\nlisted companies and then you have a rather small domestic sector\n\n\nI think there's quite a lot of room for entrepreneurship within the\ndomestic sector\n\n\nAs to whether you can make that jump from being a small time\nessentially city oriented economy as Dr Thurow said\n\n\nWhether you can make that leap to becoming even more national\nregional entrepreneur I think that is a very good question to ask \n\n\nMartin Dr Thurow Martin Dr Thurow Martin \n\n<$C> \n\nWell my view is that uh the government's stand on the role of\nthe entrepreneur or entrepreneurship in Singapore is not explicit and if you\nlook for the clues the clues are there in terms of where they gonna be\nallocating resources in the next lap you know with regard to uh Singapore's\neconomy\n\n\nBut unless the stay is made more explicit it is very difficult for\nthe other tier in the economy to response ie the institutions uh aided\nprofessional bodies the organisation and so forth \n\n\nMartin  \n\n\nDr Thurow \n\n<$A> \n\nIf I could add to that I think I think uhm in the problem of\nentrepreneurship really is like when you mention failure it's like dealing\nwith the problem impotence\n\n\nIt's dealing with the problem of failure in that sense and it's\nalso problem of attitude\n\n\nYou've got to be more relaxed about your failure\n\n\nYou've got to be more relaxed about the overall environment the\nsocial culture environment the educational environment the regulatory\nenvironment\n\n\nWell it's very uh it's very odd to be on one hand very anxious\nabout failure and be very anxious about and very uptight about uh whether\nwe've promoting entrepreneurship enough or not\n\n\nAnd exatly like dealing with impotence you just got to be more\nrelaxed as a society as a whole relaxed about failure relaxed about many\nother things that we have including regulations\n\n\nAnd when that kind of attitudinal environment exist then I think\nentrepreneurship will arise on its own accord\n\n\nI don't think you can structure it and and mandate and and order it\nto come about \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$B> \n\nWell I think a lot depends on the individual alright\n\n\nIf you are strong enough alright and uh that your inclination and\nyour ambition is that you want to make it and that you take that important\nstep and all you see is that you want to make it and the very thought of\nfailure should be right at the back of your the far end at the back of your\nmind\n\n\nOkay take that plunge\n\n<$C> \n\nHere I would agree with uh with Rachel totally\n\n\nI I think in the Singapore context this is gonna be very difficult\nto change the environment in terms you know the low tolerance for failures\n\n\nAt the end of the day it has got to be with you the entrepreneur\n\n\n\nMartin \n\n<$A> \n\nNow I I would disagree I would disagree with that view totally\n\n\nI think we should not take it as a given that Singapore society is\ngoing to have this high level of intolerance for failure we should take it as\na given and therefore we just praise uhm and try to nurture those\nentrepreneurs who have made it\n\n\nI think history has shown that a lot of entrepreneurs will finally\nbecome successful were not successful initially\n\n\nAnd I think the the the the crux of the problem really is with the\neducational system uhm an educational system which on one hand I think we\nshould certainly we should certainly promote meritocracy we should give a lot\nof attention to achievement orientation but there should not be that\ncollorary stigma attached to failure\n\n\nI think in educational system today we have a lot of young people\nwho at a very age already think they're washed out and they're failures\n\n\nLuckily I think educational system is changing today so that those\npeople who are not like to <unclear> word </unclear> that much uh to do that\nwell in in grades and academically now probably can find other areas where\nentrepreneurial flair can be developed\n\n\nThey can go to fashion school\n\n\nThey can do a lot of other things which previously they could not\ndo\n\n\nBut you know I think a lot of it starts from young\n\n\nIf you're going to be risk averse when you're young if you are\nscared to try things because you think if you fail your peers are going to\nlook down upon you uh society is going to look down upon you and that happens\nto you when you're a teenage what are you going to be like at the age of\nthirty\n\n\nThere will be very few Rachel Swees around \n\n\nMartin Dr Thurow Martin \n\n<$C> \n\nWell I guess uh you have to do a number of things you know\n\n\nFirst is you got to sit down and think through it\n\n\nAnd uh I would advise uh you to think about uh where you are right\nnow and give due consideration to the best case worst case scenario and uh\nyou know if it makes sense to you uh after due delineation have been\nexercised push on with it \n\n\nMartin \n\n\nWell I'm talking about okay thinking about things like you know how\nare you going to market it\n\n\nI'm thinking about uh you know who who will who will buy your you\nknow your new uh product \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$A> \n\nCrazy absolutely crazy \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$A> \n\nWell maybe if you were a PhD in Zoology first okay and genetic\nengineering and everything else maybe I would say okay\n\n\nI'll take a little look at it but I would say I'll be a little bit\ndoubtful that you could hybridise the chicken and the duck anyway \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$A> \n\nGood good for you \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$A> \n\nIt'll help a little bit \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$B> \n\nHave you done a survey of the market as to whether people\nwould want to consume products like that\n\n<$A> \n\nThat's right\n\n\nWho likes eating chucks you know what I call due <unclear> word\n</unclear> \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$B> \n\nAlright What are the potential what are the potential market\n\n\nI mean who are your target audience so to speak and uhm what kind\nof return do you expect of it \n\n\nMartin Dr Thurow Martin \n\n<$C> \n\nYou need resources \n\n\nMartin \n\n\nI think there are a lot of them \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$A> \n\nI think there's a difference\n\n\nI think that the example you took of entrepreneurship highlights I\nthink a misconception of what successful and unsuccessful entrepreneurship\ncould be\n\n\nI think that for every one chuck inventor like you there are\nprobably ten thousand other people who have think they have designed a better\nmouse-trap a better hair-styling lotion or whatever\n\n\nThese are the the product entrepreneurs that thinkers and the\ninventors\n\n\nI think the ratio of success for these people actually is very very\nsmall\n\n\nBut the other kind of entrepreneur which is likely to be able to\nsucceed I think a bit better is probably the more practical kind perhaps\npeople who work in an MNC an not one person three four people from an MNC\ncome out of MNC and then provide an <unclear> word </unclear> already\nexisting type of service or product probably at a cheaper price with an\nimprovement\n\n\nSo you don't have that uh that sort the rather more romantic idea\nof the entrepreneur the Thomas Addison who invents the lightbulb I think\nthat's really too romanticised\n\n<$C> \n\nWhat I would call organisation sponsered \n\n\nMartin \n\n<$A> \n\nUhm I think you should go to your uncle your grandfather\nevery other rich relative you have because seriously if you got a chuck idea\nuh especially that has got to do animals which is another big problem\naltogether because you're dealing with a lot of other intangibles and even\ncreating a computer\n\n\nUhm I don't think any venture <unclear> word </unclear> is really\ngoing to finance you so hope you have a rich uncle and or marry somebody very\nrich\n\n\nThat's the only way you're going to get your money \n\n\nMartin Dr Thurow Martin \n\n<$A> \n\nBut I think there is a very fundamental quantitative\ndifference between this chuck and Ben and Jerry's ice-cream because the Ben\nand Jerry ice-cream is an incremental innovation\n\n\nIt's providing a product that's already very well-known with\nmanufacturing processes that are also very well-known\n\n\nIt's creating a market niche for itself within an already very\nlarge market the US ice-cream market and it's creating a different kind of\nproduct\n\n\nSo in in that sense if you didn't create a chuck if you found a\nnew way of making Hainanese chicken rice that was better quality uh then I\nmay be willing to finance you but my concern is that this chuck is quite\ndifferent from Ben and Jerry's ice-cream\n\n\nIt's a totally new product that has never been tried out before\n\n\n\nMartin Dr Thurow \n\n<$C> \n\nI think there're two ways\n\n\nOne would be to look for venture capital funds that are purely\nventure capital funds \n\n\nNow the one problem with that is that many of these funds have\nvery high uh hundle criteria for return on investments and they also have a\nshort pay back period They've got to be able to cash out of your investment\nwithin five years or so So there's a lot of stress on you if you get a pure\nventure capital fund On the other hand you've also got very large companies\ninsurance companies some of the GLCs operating enterprises that have got\ninvestment arms and I think these investments arms are in many ways better\npartners Uh on one hand they bring to you not just money nor just\nprofessional expertise in terms of pretty professional expertise but they\nalso bring to you a lot of connections that they may have in their own\noperating ventures Uh and in this respect I think one should consider not\njust getting money from banks nor just pure venture capital funds but finding\nan actual operating partner to go into business with you", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f58b37e0-95bd-4897-8aeb-6e421249c5ae", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.559009+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nBut first Singlish on TV\n\n\nWith me tonight the people who featured prominently in the recent\ndebate Elaine Ong an undergraduate\n\n\nElaine wrote to the press last week to say that Singlish should not\nbe used on TV\n\n\nSidney Wyse a newsletter editor wrote in to agree with her\n\n\nJacintha Absheganaden entertainer and presenter of Mum's Not Cooking\nshe disagrees with both of them\n\n\nThey have slug it down on the papers now we'll get a chance to hear\ntheir views direct on TV\n\n\nThe question is should we say can we use Singlish or Singlish can or\nnot\n\n\nIn any case you're wondering why we're talking about this night\n\n\nHere's why\n\n\n\n\n<$A> \n\nFairly provocative comment from Kerpal\n\n\nThat's a good starting point for our discussion this evening\n\n\nElaine let me start with you\n\n\nSome people who read your letter to the press to the paper say that\nuhm you come across as someone quite ashamed of Slinglish\n\n\nIs that a fair comment\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm firstly I like to say that I don't believe that there is\nsuch a thing as Singlish\n\n\nWhat you call Singlish I would call bad English because a a term\nlike don't shy uhm do you consider that Singlish or bad English\n\n\nWhat's the difference\n\n<$C> \n\nWho's the arbiter here of of uh of that\n\n\nI mean uh are you saying that don't shy is you're saying don't say\ndon't shy is it\n\n<$B> \n\nIs it bad English or is it Singlish or are they the same thing\n\n<$C> \n\nDoes it matter\n\n<$D> \n\nIt does actually\n\n<$C> \n\nWhy\n\n<$D> \n\nYou see when you say don't shy\n\n<$C> \n\nBut if I said to you uh Sidney if I said to you uh join me\njoin me don't shy\n\n<$D> \n\nWell that's different\n\n\nNow when you say don't shy it's it's uh it's not correct it's\nimproper and you let you have not actually <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$C> \n\nBut are you considering that the context in which I'm saying\nit\n\n<$D> \n\nWell then you may have to explain that to to the viewers\n\n<$C> \n\nI am an entertainer and I am the presenter of a show\n\n<$D> \n\nWell as as an entertainer and a presenter you have two things\nto think about\n\n\nOne children two adults\n\n\nAs adults we are quite comfortable with that such languages But as\nas\n\n<$C> \n\nLanguage\n\n<$D> \n\nLanguage I meant\n\n\nUh but with a child you have a serious problem\n\n<$C> \n\nNo it's not my problem Sydney\n\n\nI'm just an entertainer\n\n\nAs an entertainer I'm allowed to suspend belief okay because I may\nnot be acting or presenting as myself Jacintha I may be presenting a persona\n\n\nNow that persona within the parameters of the show uh is allowed to\nuh take on a certain things which are part of entertainment\n\n\nNow entertainment is about magic\n\n\nIt's about uhm there are a lot of children now in Singapore who\nbelieves that if they go on the living room carpet uh they will fly\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I don't think so\n\n\nI don't think so\n\n<$D> \n\nIs is it about gibberish\n\n<$C> \n\nSorry\n\n<$D> \n\nIs it about gibberish\n\n<$C> \n\nIs it about gibberish Sydney\n\n<$D> \n\nYes yes\n\n<$A> \n\nWell let let me put it this way\n\n\nSydney may I may intervene\n\n<$D> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm I think your concern is really very much uh whether\nchildren will misunderstand will be misled\n\n<$D> \n\nMisled\n\n<$A> \n\nIs that is that your\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't think children can make the difference They can't they\ncannot differentiate\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$D> \n\nGrowing children would have a a problem there because they\nwill take it as the correct English\n\n<$A> \n\nWill children take it to be the correct English\n\n<$B> \n\nYes they will\n\n<$A> \n\nUh what would be the role of parents in trying to direct them\naccordingly\n\n<$D> \n\nBut can you imagine the parent spending every other second\ncorrecting their child and say don't follow this don't use it\n\n\nThis is incorrect than what the <unclear> word </unclear> show\n\n<$C> \n\nThere are many informal situations in the home where Singlish\nis used\n\n\nYou see I feel very much that this discussion is kind of passe\nreally is uh we're we're being a bit old-fashioned here in discussing\ndiscussing Singlish in the first place\n\n<$B> \n\nNo I think there's a time and place where I use to speak\n\n<$D> \n\nThere is a time and place precisely\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay okay let's let's take about that time and place for\ndiscussing it\n\n<$C> \n\nThe context\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm so you talk about context and perhaps you can also talk\nabout motivation you know uh why is this person using Singlish and why using\nthis particular thing programme or uh as or or or discussion live discussion\nas a forum Let's discuss that\n\n\nWhat did what is appropriate\n\n\nWho decides what's appropriate\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm that was my question to you\n\n<$A> \n\nYah\n\n\nElaine\n\n<$B> \n\nWhen you said appropriate what do you mean by\n\n<$C> \n\nHe asked the question\n\n<$A> \n\nYah yah I mean for whom is it appropriate\n\n\nWho decides whether this is permissible or not\n\n<$B> \n\nMaybe you should have a body that actually regulates\n\n<$A> \n\nAnother body to regulate\n\n<$D> \n\nNot another body\n\n\nI think before you even initiate you\n\n<$C> \n\nI don't think we're talking about language here you see\n\n\nI feel very much that Singlish is not about language it's about a\nsubculture\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay Ja Jacintha maybe we should let uh Sydney complete his\nthoughts\n\n<$D> \n\nYes uh I think before we actually initiate uh a programme we\nhave to seek uh the opinion of the majority how they would react\n\n\nAnd if you if they feel uncomfortable or they feel that the\nprogramme is not suitable for the general public don't feature it\n\n<$C> \n\nIf this is the way we're thinking about most things in\nSingapore then uhm you know it might be very very hard to launch many things\nbecause we are very kiasu as uhm as Kumar said just now\n\n<$D> \n\nYou may be kiasu\n\n<$C> \n\nNo no no no\n\n<$D> \n\nBut I don't think the majority of the people are kiasu\n\n\nI think there are people\n\n<$C> \n\nHow do we do this poll\n\n\nYou know nothing will get started we must be spontaneous we should\nbe we should just try\n\n<$D> \n\nYou see we don't have to we don't have to put ourselves in an\nincorrect situation\n\n<$C> \n\nNo we're certainly don't\n\n<$D> \n\nSo you're agreeing with me that Singlish is is\n\n<$C> \n\nI am not\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay perhaps perhaps we we may not be getting anywhere if we\nuse terms like incorrect because incorrect is really subjective incorrect in\nwhat sense\n\n\nUh if you're using grammar as a as a yardstick yah perhaps in it\nis it isn't correct\n\n\nBut if you are suggesting that oh if we can agree that it is\nsomething that's been evolving naturally in Singapore then\n\n<$C> \n\nI have to suggest that\n\n<$A> \n\nWe have to see it from a different point of view\n\n\nLet me just put it to you this way\n\n\nIf we your concern is children are impressionable they could be\nmisled\n\n<$D> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nBut there are many other ways perhaps that children could be\nmisled\n\n\nMedia is one way so do you think we could end up cloistering them\nand over protecting them\n\n<$C> \n\nWhich was my point in the newspaper that perhaps you know we\nshould be able to learn to laugh at ourselves a liitle bit more and that uh\n\n<$B> \n\nBut there should be a time when you have to stop\n\n<$D> \n\nBut not like this but not yes\n\n\nBut not laugh at the stupidity of ourselves I mean if that\n\n<$C> \n\nOh no no nobody is suggesting that we're being patronising by\nusing Singlish that's what I mean\n\n\nI don't feel that Singlish is about language and sometimes it's\nnot what you say it's how you say it\n\n\nIf I said you as I was saying before uhm join me join me don't shy\n\n\nYou might forget that I didn't put the be in it you know but if I\nsaid to you join me join don't shy uh it sounds Singlish so sometimes it's\nthe tone in which we speak uh or we use Singlish\n\n<$D> \n\nBut you can't understand one thing you are an en an en an\nentertainment as you mentioned earlier\n\n<$C> \n\nYou should understand that\n\n<$D> \n\nAlright and being an entertainer you could easily influence\nespecially the growing children not so much the adult you won't influence me\nbut you will influence the little girl the little boy\n\n\nNow who's responsible for bad English\n\n\nIt's you\n\n<$A> \n\nSydney if I may come in on this\n\n\nNow uhm some people feel in fact quite a few people feel in\nSingapore that it is closely linked to a to our national identity\n\n\nIt is not the national identity but it's closely linked Uh in your\nletter you did end by saying that treat Singlish as nothing more than a joke\n\n\nUh were you serious about that\n\n<$D> \n\nI'll be very serious\n\n<$C> \n\nMay I set a language example that a hundred years ago a word\nlike perambulator was the standard form usage of what we now know as pram and\nyou know you might a hundred years ago it would be absolutely correct to say\nexcuse me but could you please move your perambulator but now we say excuse\nme please move your pram\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay okay if that's what you're saying\n\n<$C> \n\nAh what was slang what was considered slang it's what you are\nsaying now\n\n<$D> \n\nIt's just it's just like a typewriter It's just like a\ntypewriter\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay my dear friends my dear friends if if we go this way I\ndon't think we can come to any agreement\n\n\nNot that we should come to an agreement but let me put this\nquestion to you is it possible at all for us to come to some form of\nagreement on this issue some form of agreement and what would that be\n\n\nLet me let me have a very quick comment from each of you\n\n\nLet me start from Elaine Elaine\n\n<$B> \n\nI I don't think so\n\n\nI don't think there's a middle line where you say yes sometimes\nyou use it I mean on the media sometimes you don't in the media but\n\n<$D> \n\nSo you feel that there's no way we can agree\n\n\nThere's no way we can compromise\n\n<$B> \n\nEither we use it or we don't in the on the media yah\n\n<$A> \n\nJacintha\n\n\nCan we agree on something on this issue\n\n<$C> \n\nI totally agree that the use of Singlish has to be taken in\nwhatever context me uhm and therefore uh when you say it's use in certain\nsituations it's absolutely correct to use certain in a court I wouldn't say\nto the judge uh I wouldn't speak Singlish to the judge we have to use\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy not uh if you are so proud about uh\n\n<$C> \n\nNo no I'm not talking about the two faces of the use of\nlanguage\n\n<$D> \n\nQuick comment okay\n\n\nCan we just wrap up your thought please\n\n\nWe're running out\n\n<$C> \n\nI want to communicate to my fellow Singaporean and in many\nsituations from me to communicate in a friendly\n\n<$D> \n\nAre you underestimating the the ability of the Singaporeans\n\n<$C> \n\nYou certainly sound defensive and uncommunicative now in your\nformal\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay thanks\n\n\nSydney your <unclear> word </unclear> your thoughts please\n\n\nDo you think we can agree on something here\n\n<$D> \n\nI think that for as long as you want uh I mean for example if\nif you want to speak English speak it the correct way\n\n\nNow there are times you might\n\n<$C> \n\nWhy should you be so pretentious\n\n<$D> \n\nYou you might fumble\n\n\nThere are times you might fumble but that does not in any way uh\nput you in a very bad situation\n\n\nBut if you deliberately speak Singlish then I think that's bad\nbecause you are encouraging improper English\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n\nWell looks like we really cannot come to any kind of agreement\n\n\nIt's an age old debate age old discussion\n\n\nUhm perhaps we should just let it evolves naturally without\nperhaps promoting it or forcing it", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL",

{"text": "<$A> \n\nGood evening and welcome to Talking Point your weekly forum\nwhere you can give your views live on air here on Channel News Asia\n\n\nI'm Ida Bachtiar\n\n\nTonight we are discussing a very real dilemma for many married\ncouples in Singapore having children\n\n\nPopulation experts are already warning us that we're just not\nproducing enough babies to replace ourselves\n\n\nBut more couples these days are choosing to stop at just one or two\nor even none at all\n\n\nIs it their fast pace lifestyles a demanding career money before\nfamily\n\n\nIt could be any number of individual factors but a common one could\nvery well be what Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong recently suggested childcare\nconcerns\n\n\nNow how much does this stop couples from having more children\n\n\nDo take part in our discussion by calling 6910028\n\n\nSo are you in the same boat\n\n\nDo you think better support services will help after all grand\nparents aren't available to baby-sit and you can't afford or you are not\ncomfortable in hiring a maid\n\n\nWhat are your options really\n\n\nPlease share your comments and questions with us by calling at\n6910028\n\n\nAnd here to give their perspectives we have in the studio nominated\nMP Dr Jennifer Lee and Associate Professor Ngiam Tee Liang from the National\nUniversity of Singapore\n\n\nWe'll be back with your calls stay with us\n\n\nWelcome back to Talking Point\n\n\nOur focus tonight what's keeping Singaporeans from having more\nchildren\n\n\nAre childcare problems the issue and what more can government\nauthorities and companies do to help\n\n\nTo share their views and answer some of your questions is Dr\nJennifer Lee NMP and CEO of KK Hospital and Associate Professor Nigam Tee\nLiang from the NUS Social Work and Psychology department\n\n\nThank you so much for coming into studio\n\n\nBefore I begin our discussion perhaps I could read to you some of\nthe emails that we have gotten seems to be quite a heart-felt topic\n\n\nWe have uh an email here from Daphanie Chng\n\n\nShe says I'm a full-time working mother of a six-month-old baby\ngirl\n\n\nThe financial status of my husband and I don't allow us to engage a\nmaid plus we don't feel safe leaving the maid alone with our baby so my\nmother currently looks after her during the day\n\n\nBut she's not willing to live with us so we have to travel about\ntwo and a half hours everyday and in the end we don't get much we don't get\nto interact much with our baby\n\n\nWe're also worried my mother's surroundings might not be giving my\nbaby best influence\n\n\nWe believe as parents we should give our best and we'd like to have\nmore kids\n\n\nBecause of this we are now thinking twice\n\n\nThere's another email also from Kenny and Kenny says here\n\n\nI believe the drastic drop in fertility rates can be attributed to\nan increase in well-educated highly qualified women\n\n\nUnlike a decade ago our globalised economy has forced numerous\nwomen to venture out of the home\n\n\nAs the traditional stereotyped of wives carrying a baby in one arm\nand a mop in the other is eradicated we are seeing more cases of Singapore\nwomen holding top jobs in MNCs\n\n\nWell clearly times has changed and right you know most people are\nnot looking towards having children to look after them I their old age\n\n\nWomen don't need to have children to prove that they are worth\nsomething\n\n\nWhat then are we looking at\n\n\nIs Singapore going to see this uh as an increasing trend of women\nnot wanting to have children\n\n\nWhat is what's your feelings about it\n\n<$B> \n\nUh well I think the uh figures are there for us\n\n\nI track them very closely because uhm you know more babies are good\nfor us talking about KK Hospital\n\n\nUh very purely selfish reasons but yes uhm you can see that the\ntrends are the fertility rates has gone down and despite all our efforts it\ncontinues to be that way\n\n\nUh it's a multi- <unclear> word </unclear> problem so I don't think\nthere's any simple answers and I think what we'll be talking about childcare\nthat's definitely one of the issues but not the only one\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n\nWe have two callers already waiting to join us in studio\n\n\nIf you may I'd just like to go to them too\n\n\nHi you're with Talking Point\n\n\nMay I know who is that please\n\n<$C> \n\nHello yah good evening\n\n<$A> \n\nHello good evening\n\n<$C> \n\nYes I am Raymond Yip\n\n<$A> \n\nHi Raymond what would you like to say\n\n<$C> \n\nJust want to comment uh thing is that I think the uhm of\ncourse everyone knows the problems uhm that you know uhm that prevent people\nfrom having more children\n\n\nOne of the main concerns is uh is the childcare issue which is very\nimportant to families especially families wanted the best of their children\n\n\nThe other thing of course with childcare expenses is not cheap so\nit's very high\n\n\nFor those who have two or even three children\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm how many do you have\n\n<$C> \n\nTwo two myself\n\n<$A> \n\nAre you planning to have another one\n\n<$C> \n\nUh very concern about the financial situation\n\n<$A> \n\nRight\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd the help uh in fact nowadays the in-laws and parents are\nvery reluctant to chip in to help\n\n<$A> \n\nRight\n\n<$C> \n\nSo uh I'm concern more on the financial aspect where even uh I\nknow of friends who having three children even uh the mother herself have to\nquit the job for three to four years to stay home\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$C> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> that is really taxing on the husband\n\n<$A> \n\nRight\n\n\nRaymond thank you very much for joining us thank you\n\n\nWe have another caller on the line\n\n\nHi you're with Talking Point may I know who's that please\n\n<$D> \n\nHello\n\n<$A> \n\nYes hi could you speak up a little bit\n\n<$D> \n\nHi this is Joanne Yap\n\n\nI'm calling about this third child issue because I'm currently\nexpecting my third child and she's due to arrive already in January but up to\nnow I'm quite surprised to find out that the government is not supporting us\nwith any maternity leave at all\n\n\nSo I really hope that the government body would try and impose this\nrule so that <unclear> word </unclear> because knowing that if nobody should\nsay it's a compulsory thing no companies would give it to any mothers\n\n\nThis is a fact so if the government can look at it it's like a\n<unclear> word </unclear> thing like uhm if a women having a third child goes\naway on maternity they can somehow get some kind of maybe like rebates from\nthe government or whatsoever then <unclear> word </unclear> encourage women\nto have more children I guess\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay thank you very much for joining us thank you\n\n\nSo we've a situation where the government is saying this there's\njust not enough people having babies so like scholars said you know it's like\nnational service\n\n\nAt the same time we're facing two issues here uhm financial\nconcerns and childcare concerns\n\n\nWhat is your feeling about the way the policy are instituted in\nSingapore\n\n\nIs there enough being done\n\n<$E> \n\nIt is true that the policy so far that's been implemented by\nthe government has actually to meet sometimes what we called multiple\nconflicting objectives because on the one hand you would want to have more\nbirth but it is how you try to encourage\n\n\nSo the tax incentives are there no maternity leave for the third\nchild but uh you could have your tax breaks but that is only for those who\nare paying income tax\n\n\nSo it is a concern for those who would like to have more but they\ndon't seem to be in that income bracket that the government has in mind\n\n\nAnd this is where we have to turn to other measures other than just\na physical incentives\n\n\nAnd uh it does mean relooking at the whole package of childcare\nsubsidies for your children to be in childcare centres uh the operating costs\nand of course more importantly the community support system\n\n\nI think so far we have not touched on this area where in the past\nit has been quite uh accepted traditional way in which you have uh\nchild-minder in the neighbourhood you have got uh local babysitters\n\n\nUhm that is a big issue that we need to actually address\n\n<$B> \n\nI think uhm I think three parties need to get involve in this\n\n\nWe Singaporeans are firstly we always think of government pitching\nto help in one way or the other\n\n\nBut I think also companies in terms of uh family friendly policies\nand I think also individuals\n\n\nUhm if we talk first perhaps about companies uhm I think in\ndeveloped countries there is an awareness of uh the need to retain women in\nthe workforce\n\n\nAnd uh there are quite a few companies now more and more who have\nput in who pay a lot attention to having family friendly practices\n\n\nAnd the there are there is a whole range of of these but the most\nimportant would be uhm two things\n\n\nOne is flexibility in working arrangements so that it's easier for\npeople to manage working moms to manage flexi-time part-time you know tele\nworking things like that\n\n\nUhm the second big thing is of course would be onsite childcare\ncentres\n\n\nSo if you have a combination of these that would help\n\n\nBut I think we also have to be realistic about uhm you have to\nconvince companies to do this\n\n\nAnd uhm I I personally feel and for KK Hospital especially because\nwe have eighty-seven per cent women and it is very important for us to retain\nyou know women in the workforce working with us even after they have kids\n\n\nUhm there are things that you can do but you need to be convinced\nthat it make sense ultimately to the company that you are not in any way\ngoing to affect productivity or <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nBut uhm what people don't realise I think is the cost of losing a\nwell-trained experienced skilled person\n\n\nThe the is not just a matter of going out to interview you know to\nadvertise interview and recruit\n\n\nIs that whole cycle of training someone uhm of the drop in service\nuhm levels as you are having some new young person onboard\n\n\nSo I think if we could have some work done that could convince\nlocal companies that this is something that is important for them to look at\nthen that would be very good\n\n<$A> \n\nI'd like to go into that a little further\n\n\nWe have another caller though joining us\n\n\nHi you're with Talking Point\n\n\nMay I know who is that please\n\n<$F> \n\nOkay I'm Chandra from Telok Blangah calling\n\n<$A> \n\nHi Chandra\n\n<$F> \n\nYes my point is that uh you know there are so much emphasis\non children and all that nowadays\n\n\nAnd if the mother is not at home to look after the kid I think I'm\nafraid there is this problem of latch-key kids coming up here\n\n\nSo uh this is very much seen in today's scenario in Singapore\nespecially\n\n\nSo I think uh parents are very afraid to have another child coming\nto this world when there is no one to really properly care for it you know in\nterms of real parental care\n\n\nAnd that's the main problem that people are facing in having\nanother child\n\n<$A> \n\nRight and having the wife not work is not uh a solution\neither\n\n<$F> \n\nYes exactly\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay thank you very much for joining us Chandra\n\n<$F> \n\nThank you\n\n<$A> \n\nThank you\n\n<$F> \n\nBye bye\n\n<$A> \n\nSo even if we solved the problem by getting your employers to\nuh somehow you find a way to lobby that uhm you're still spending time away\nfrom work uh away from your child\n\n\nAt the same time you also need to work because you need to earn\nthe income for your child\n\n\nWhat are we looking at then you know we have this conflicting uhm\naspirations in in women nowadays\n\n\nYou know they want to work and want to have a child\n\n\nDo you see this as something that can be resolved", "subdomain":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nThe committee however recognised the limitations of using the C\nP I to measure the cost of living\n\n\nIt proposed two key refinements\n\n\nOne to have three C P Is for different income groups and two that\nimputed rentals used for measuring housing cost be brought more closely in\nline with market rentals\n\n\nNow to elaborate I have uh Deputy Director with the Institute of\nPolicy Studies economist Doctor Lee Tsao Yuan and nominated M P Mister Chia\nShi Teck\n\n\nGood evening why don't we look straight away at this question of uh\nhow housing is computed and put into the uh C P I because this is the one\narea that the committee uh specifically mentioned and one might say even\ncriticise\n\n\nNow why is this such a difficult issue\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's a very difficult issue because one wants to actually\ncapture in some ways the consumption that one gets out of housing rather than\nhousing as an investment per say So actually one of the best methodologies\nused is really this imputed rental concept The difficulty though with that in\nSingapore is that eighty-seven per cent of households in Singapore own their\nown homes So then the question is how does one then impute rent to actually a\nhouse which is actually lived in by its owners\n\n\nAnd that is the difficulty for public housing\n\n\nSo that is why the committee has recommended that actually the\nimputed rental computation be improved\n\n<$C> \n\nOkay how are they gonna do this uhm I mean what is the real\nproblem that uh according to the report you used H D B prices\n\n<$B> \n\nRental prices\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm for housing rental price\n\n<$B> \n\nYes but the thing is that these rental prices actually are\napplicable to those flats which are actually rented out which are smaller\nflats like one-room two-room flats they're not the three room four-room flats\nthat the majority of Singaporeans live in nowadays\n\n\nSo while private housing I think it's fairly well taken care of\nbecause there is actually quite a good rental market for private pricing but\nwhen one comes to public housing then I think there is some difficulty\n\n\nSo it is hoped that actually the authorities can do something about\nimproving this measure\n\n<$C> \n\nOkay now\n\n<$D> \n\nI thought the committee sorry did uh look the private sector's\nuh rental prices and try to compute it and the uh effect is rather small\n\n\nBut here we we must add because of the eighty-seven per cent the\nhome ownership in Singapore it is unique in its own right and we are looking\nat the uh investment side of the housing taking the fact that the property\nvalues will go up\n\n\nBut what if the value comes down\n\n\nI think that would be uh how would it be taken as a consumption\n\n\nI think that is the point\n\n<$C> \n\nOkay that's one issue Now are there any other limitations with\nthe C P I as an index\n\n\nShi Teck\n\n<$D> \n\nYah I think the C P I is a general uh indicator\n\n\nIt doesn't a a person or a family at any point in time say if\nyou're buying a house or if you're buying a car your C your car is due for\nnew C O E then the impact on you will be higher\n\n\nOr you are you have aged parents or you have students that go to\nuniversities so your feeling of the cost of living that has gone up is much\nhigher than the general indicator\n\n\nSo the C P I should be take taken as a general indicator and it has\nits limitations\n\n<$C> \n\nNow\n\n<$B> \n\nI think uh David if I may add to that\n\n\nI think that the the one important question that we need to settle\nhere is what does the C P I actually measure\n\n<$C> \n\nRight\n\n<$B> \n\nI think most Singaporeans are really thinking of a cost of\nliving index\n\n\nFor example if they take a bowl of noodles in a hawker centre and\nthen they also take a bowl of noodles in a noodle house\n\n\nWhere the C P I is concerned those are actually two different items\naltogether\n\n\nAnd therefore it's not so much just the price change alone but also\na quality change which the cost of living index measures\n\n\nBut a C P I measures very strictly only the price change and not\nthe quality change\n\n<$C> \n\nOkay now one other issue is the whole question of weightage\n\n\nUhm in a separate minority report committee member Lau Teir Kiang\nuh said that the C P I is deficient in some respects because the weightage\ngiven to some key items like medical care education housing and cars and and\nprivate transport does not reflect recent changes in government policy\n\n\nNow have these changes had a major impact on household expenditure\n\n<$B> \n\nI think we will really only know when we get the result of the\nninety-two ninety-three household expenditure survey\n\n\nHaving said that however based on past experience in comparing the\neighty-seven eighty-eight expenditure survey with that of eighty-two\neighty-three there were only minor changes and it really resulted in just\nsmall changes in the C P I\n\n<$C> \n\nNow does that\n\n<$D> \n\nAs I said the impact on the particular family or person is\ndependent on the person's uh spending pattern or the person's habit at that\npoint in time\n\n\nIf you have aged parents that need to go to hospital and all of a\nsudden you are hit\n\n<$C> \n\nWell does this therefore render the current weightage\nirrelevant\n\n<$D> \n\nNo the weightage is relevant but the person that is affected\nat any point in time may not be the time\n\n\nYou you're talking about general indicator and that's why the\ncommittee actually dealt in the four key E area to to zero in on what\nactually is uh worrying people\n\n<$C> \n\nOkay but then why do you want to to go to the ninety-two\nninety-three uhm survey household survey\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause that will that will probably have weights which are\nmore relevant to the current period\n\n\nBut having said that however my own call it suspicion or intuition\nas it were is that I think that there were only result in small changes in\nthe C P I increases\n\n<$C> \n\nBut but you will make it more you'll bring it more up-to-date\n\n\nNow very quickly in in writing the report as you were one of key uh\npersons in writing the report were there any issues in which uh you had\ndifficulties sort of gaining consensus\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I think we had difficulties with regards to housing and I\nthink Shi Teck had a lot to say about housing for instance\n\n<$C> \n\nJust housing\n\n<$D> \n\nI think more than housing\n\n\nYes I think you were saying earlier we we must not take C P I to\nrepresent everything\n\n\nThe basket must be there because we spend on all kinds of things\nand the weightage is given to the kind uh to to the importance\n\n\nBut what affects us may be one particular item and that we we have\nforgotten we just look zero on our item and thing that the cost of everything\nhas gone up in in that particular\n\n<$C> \n\nOkay we'll come back with further discussion on on the report\n\n\nWe gonna take a break now\n\n\nWhen we come we look at the committee's findings on cost increases\nin housing education health and transport\n\n<$C> \n\nHigher expectations versus higher costs\n\n\nSingaporeans want more of the good life which does not come cheap\nin a country facing scare resources\n\n\nHow can two seemingly opposing factors be reconciled\n\n\nUhm Shi Teck want do you think\n\n<$D> \n\nI think first and foremost we must accept the fact that there\nare limitations and there is a price to pay\n\n\nSo the government's role basically is the lower income group is the\naffordability so to make sure that people can afford to buy the roof over\ntheir head and they can afford to fall sick\n\n\nBut uh for those who are looking for a dream homes then they would\nhave to work for it and the that is where we have to accept the fact that\nthere are limitations\n\n<$C> \n\nYes now you \n\n\nI think the key question here is the extend to which government uh\npolicies and government actions actually raise the cost of these items\n\n\nTo what extend does this happen\n\n<$B> \n\nI think of the four factors mentioned if I were to actually\norder them in terms of priority\n\n\nI would think that the two most important would be first scarce\nresources rapid economic growth\n\n\nIf it were not for the recession I think in eighty-five eighty-six\nI think cost would have risen much more so rapid economic growth is very\nimportant Second I would think that expectations upgrading the desire for a\nbetter quality of life\n\n\nIf you add to that the fact of the timing of the fee increases that\nbunched everything up together\n\n\nIt doesn't mean actually though that these cost increases would not\nhave occurred\n\n\nAnd also the reduction of subsidy rates I think is also another\nimportant factor but that is I think a much more fundamental ideological\nquestion and I agree with the government's stand that we should not adopt\nhefty social welfare policies\n\n<$D> \n\nBut even the limitations uh Da David cost must go up\n\n\nSo now the question is what kind of policies we must adopt to\nensure that the cost don't go out of the reach of the people because it's not\njust the lower uh group of people\n\n\nThere are people who want to aspire it will it would be the dream\nthat actually motivate them to work further\n\n\nImagine that you you can never own a house then nobody will want to\nwork anymore\n\n\nSo I think it is the the control and maybe certain kind of a a\nassistance should be uh looked in in the kind of the policies we have\n\n\nI I don't buy that everything should be left to market forces\nbecause given the limitations there's just no market forces to determinate\n\n\nThe land is scarce you can corner up the land or the people in the\ncar industry must buy up the C O Es because they got to sell cars\n\n\nSo that itself is already uh clear that it's not a open uh market\nforces\n\n\nSo with that in mind we have to move and uh uh manipulate a little\n\n<$C> \n\nWell what can the government do about the rate of these price\nincreases\n\n<$B> \n\nI think one of the main things is still back to productivity\nincreases\n\n\nThere no way around it or else we will definitely get a wage price\nspiral higher prices higher wages leading to higher prices and so on\n\n<$D> \n\nI think I agree\n\n\nBut on the other hand is government departments should not be run\nas business corporations\n\n\nTheir job is to facilitate their job is not to make money so if if\ntaken off their head then I think the cost itself need not go up uh that\nquickly For instance we accept that the land is scarce and that it should go\nwith the market price\n\n\nBut remembering that we acquire the land or the government's cost\nof land is much lower so and land is a big factor to to uh the cost of\nhousing\n\n\nSo whether the land need to be pushed to such a high price\n\n<$C> \n\nAre we asking people to lower moderate their expectations\n\n<$D> \n\nYes we have to accept the fact that there are limitations and\nwe must work\n\n\nIt's alright to want to drive big cars and live in big houses but\nyou got to work for it\n\n\nI think that part we have to accept and the government is not here\nas a Santa Claus no government can continue to be Santa Clauses\n\n<$C> \n\nIs it legitimate for people of the lower or the middle uh\nclasses to fear that these costs will increase to such an extend as to make\nthem unaffordable\n\n<$B> \n\nI think that we examine actually this question in detail and\nI think that we did come to the conclusion that in terms of affordability\nthat basic housing basic health care basic education and transportation et\ncetera are indeed affordable\n\n\nBut if you want that bit more than as Shi Teck has pointed out\nyou've got to earn it \n\n<$C> \n\nThere is there seems to be an inevitablity in uh the rise of\nof prices of some of these scare commodities especially things like housing\nand cars which are the two things that that most people aspire to Is it do we\njust have to throw our hands up in the air and say well this is evitable we\ncan't help it\n\n<$D> \n\nNo I think the the alternatives are important as I mentioned\nearlier If the public transportation is improved such that it's so efficient\non or the other hand if you live with no road control system the roads will\nbe choked that nobody will want to drive anyway So you either leave it you\nknow and and let the natural course take its place or you have some uh\nregulation some control So it's it's not a a and or kind of thing it's all in\nour mind you know If you go to Hong Kong big tycoons are taking M R Ts so\nit's a livestyle So I think we we can uh improve Alternatives are important\nor in a health care do you need to go to a one-room with television\nair-conditioned and all the frills or is it more important to ensure that the\nproper medical attention is given And that itself can be made affordable\n\n<$C> \n\nNow which of these uh items did the committee consider to be\nof most concern education housing transport uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAll of them\n\n<$D> \n\nI think all the four\n\n<$C> \n\nAll of them equally equally uh important\n\n<$B> \n\nYah yes but I think that it is also important they want to\nconsider cost increases To think about income increases as well And if you\nlook at the perspective of let's say the last ten years I think incomes have\nrisen faster than cost Standards of living have indeed improved\n\n<$D> \n\nAnd I think that that's one thing that the Singaporeans must\nuh pay tribute to the government I mean all of us have actually improved in\nthe quality of life\n\n<$C> \n\nUh Shi Teck Yuan thank you very

{"text": "<$A> \n\nThe Telecom share offer\n\n\nAt two dollars a share its total value is a staggering thirty point\nfive billion dollars\n\n\nThat's more than twice the value of the all time favourite Singapore\nAirlines\n\n\nSo just how can you make the most of this offer\n\n\nOr to discuss this I have in the studio T K Yap Director of\nPeregrine Securities and Fong Pui Leng Investment Analyst of R H B Cathay\nResearch\n\n\nThank you for joining me this evening\n\n\nNow two dollars a share is this reasonable\n\n<$B> \n\nYes certainly\n\n\nI think if you look at their P Es twenty-seven times P E uhm by it\nall judgements uhm it is within the range of expectations the market was\nlooking for a launch of uhm something even above thirty times P E\n\n<$A> \n\nDo you agree with that\n\n<$C> \n\nYes I do agree it is reasonable\n\n\nI mean it's very much I mean the offer of valuation is very much in\nline with uh the world market valuation of Telcos\n\n\nUh I mean Telecommunication Companies uh though it is on the high\nend of the twenty-two twenty-nine times uh P E range that the all these\nTelcos are trading at\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay now for the Singaporean investor who's eligible for all\nthree categories A B and C what strategy do you think they should take T K\n\n<$B> \n\nWell obviously uhm category A group group A shares are now uh\nuh good value\n\n\nI will suggest this uhm going for the maximum number of shares one\nis entitled to under A and and for C the number of shares one would apply for\nwould depends on one's uh financial background\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay now and group C is the main question is what to bid\n\n\nWhat should people be bidding for group C\n\n<$C> \n\nWell uhm even though it's at a high end of the uh I mean the\nrange that the uh world type communication companies are trading at I'd say\nthere's still a lot of upside uh given that you know the market condition\nhere is a bit different\n\n\nWe have very low interest rate very mild inflation and there's a\nlot of liquidity in the market\n\n\nUhm my gut feeling is that it can trade more than thirty times P E\nup to probably thirty-seven times\n\n\nThey will put the evaluation at the two-sixty per share\n\n<$A> \n\nTwo-sixty a share\n\n<$B> \n\nWell let's say I think if you look at forty times P E uhm\nthree dollars that's what the market has been talking about that's what the\nexpectations have been\n\n\nFor foreign investors who want the stock they have to bid and they\nwould put up the price\n\n\nSo therefore you do want the share you have no choice but to join\nthe bidding process not not very different from the way the C O Es have\nworked and it really comes down to whether you want the share and how bad you\nwant it\n\n\nUhm Telecom issue adds about thirty billion to the market\ncapitalisation institutions will have to increase weightage if those are\ntracking the market on the market cap basis in the region and so for that\nreason either they buy the other shares in Singapore or they put in the bids\nfor Telecom\n\n<$A> \n\nSo you've talked about foreign interests what do you expect\nforeign institutions to be bidding\n\n<$B> \n\nI would say that uh they would bid in excess of three dollars\nthat's just the general feel that's been going around the market today\n\n\nUhm they obviously feel that the premium would be worth paying for\nuhm but the there is quite a wide diversity of views amongst foreign\ninstitutions\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay now what about the upside potential in the shorter term\ncouple of weeks what do you expect uhm trading to open November first\n\n<$B> \n\nUh that's a very difficult question to answer if you can tell\nme how how the market will be trading by then\n\n\nI would the market uh perhaps can be looked upon as being supported\nby a base of fundamentals and on top of that you have two pillars one's\nliquidity and one's market sentiment\n\n\nIf sentiment excuse me remains liquidity is there\n\n\nI think you're gonna see uhm a very very firm opening price in\nexcess of the cut off price by then\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat do you say what will the price be in November first\n\n<$B> \n\nWell uh matters <unclear> word </unclear> by T K say to the\nlot depends on the market condition there\n\n\nUh I think it will still be very firm this sentiment in the market\nuhm I won't be surprise if it opens at uh above the two sixty\n\n\nI mean given that there's a lot of interest among the uh oversea I\nmean as well as the local fund managers uh in this issue I mean is is going\nto be a real heavy weight of I mean Singapore Telecom listing uh it's going\nto raise the market cap by about twenty per cent to account for about sixteen\nper cent\n\n\nI mean it's something that you know they could not miss out on if\nthey were to uh be I mean their portfolio were to invest in Singapore stock I\nthink they they will come in you know uh drive the share price up by bidding\nit at a higher price to make sure that they do get a portion of the uh offer\n\n<$A> \n\nHow much how much will they bid\n\n<$C> \n\nProbably three dollars\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay now are you as optimistic in the longer term for\nSingapore Telecom share prices\n\n<$B> \n\nI would say in the longer term a number of different factors\nwill come in uhm one obviously would be how the global environment changes\ngiven that the <unclear> word </unclear> Singapore Telecom in intends to move\nuhm towards the global arena uh deregulation changes a lot of caveats uhm so\nat this point in time uh the bet one has to make is whether the match will be\nable to sustain the continued growth\n\n\nNow thirteen per cent is I think uhm what would be towards the\nlonger end of general market expectations although most do feel that sixteen\nfifteen per cent uh for ninety-three is what uh Telecoms will be able to\ncomfortably deliver\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay we'll be discussing more about longer term growth later\n\n\nWell if you stay on the short-term outlook for the Telecom share\nissue we'll take a break now when we come back find out if Singapore Telecom\ncan deliver in the longer term\n\n<$A> \n\nPui Leng T K a small and fast maturing market at home and\nquestion marks at the end of the monopoly\n\n\nCan Singapore Telecom maintain double digit growth Pu Leng\n\n<$C> \n\nWell as I've said uh well I've heard the Singapore Telecoms uh\nis still faced with very bright prospect well let's say with the home front\n\n\nUh if you're merely talking about just connecting lines to new\nsubscribers well I should say the Singapore Telecoms has done a very good job\nuh we have what two to three one in two to three uh people having a a\ntelephone line\n\n\nUh but then if you were to look at uhm I mean if we're to compare\nit with let say the more advanced country like the States U K Japan uh we\nstill have a lot of room to grow\n\n\nBut I I felt the for the domestic side of the business uh for\nSingapore Telecom the greater growth potential will lies in more providing\nmore enhance services like probably dial-up uh videos and information\nretrieval uh which is becoming uh a I mean a reality with the increase use of\noptical fibres\n\n\nSo I said at the home front there'll still be a lot of growth\npotential Of course in the medium term uh well the growth to account from you\nknow rising international calls uhm increasing use of uhm you know uhm mobile\nphones with increasing mobility of people as well as uh increase data\ncommunication traffic\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat about after the monopoly ends\n\n<$C> \n\nWell after the monopoly ends uh I think Singapore uh Telecom\nwill still be the main provider uh\n\n\nIt's difficult uh for you know another operator to duplicate the\nmassive infra-structure that uh Singapore Telecom has uh invested in\n\n\nIt would take a bit of uh time\n\n<$A> \n\nT K double digit growth\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I think that's certainly possible\n\n\nThey were in <unclear> word </unclear> one wants to make big money\nor any stock uh you have to take bets and big bets\n\n\nThese bets will centre around the quality of management and the bet\nis that the management will continue uh to be very profit driven generate a\nlot of extra business\n\n\nAnd the case of S I A we've seen that being done extremely\nsuccessfully\n\n\nNow in the case of Singapore Telecom uh it will take time uh for\nthem to be able to demonstrate that growth\n\n\nAt this point in time I think the bet that one has to take is that\nthe management uh will have enough drive uh to ensure that the double gi\ndigit continues to to come through\n\n\nNow judging on the past track record it seems that there's no\nreason to doubt that it would not be able to but uh the Asian Pacific region\nis extremely fast growing region that means hea very heavy competition\n\n\nAt the end of the day uh the competition is going to come from\npeople who see the same opportunities\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay what about overseas expansion Singapore Telecom are\nrelying a lot on that\n\n\nWhere's that going to\n\n<$B> \n\nWell any overseas venture is gonna have to take time to\nnurture and mature so I think uh you're really looking for cash cow <unclear>\nword </unclear> domestic business to feed the growth in the overseas\nexpansion\n\n\nHow well you manage that growth and how well you cultivate it uh\nwould determine how well those overseas opportunities are turned into cash\ncows\n\n<$A> \n\nSo very iffy\n\n<$B> \n\nIt is very iffy because uh it really depends on one two years\nfrom now how may deals Telecom will land uh one two years from now what the\ncash flow and the profitability of those ventures are gonna be like\n\n\nUhm obviously there will be a learning process\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay what a what about long term for the Singapore Telecom\nshare price what are gonna be the critical factors for its continued growth\n\n<$B> \n\nFrom a point of view of the foreign investors uhm the Asia\nPacific region holds tremendous growth potential\n\n\nThey therefore would be looking at the individual\nTelecommunications place in the different markets P L D in Phillipines for\nexample Hong Kong Telecom on Hong Kong market Malaysian Telecom uh in in\nMalaysia uh\n\n\nAs far as the growth potential is concerned uhm many of these I\nthink would be looking to expand outside the domestic market on top of the\ngrowth they can see their own domestic markets\n\n<$A> \n\nIn ten years Singapore Telecom will be at will it be ten\nfifteen dollars\n\n<$B> \n\nI think there's every possibility you could see that\n\n\nBut for that to continue every growth company continues to evolve\ncontinues to develop and for that to happen uh we certainly would need to see\nSingapore Telecom continue to land major projects major deals\n\n\nUh that will increase profitability significantly\n\n<$A> \n\nDo you see Singapore Telecom ten years ten dollars\n\n<$C> \n\nWell is this possible\n\n\nI mean there's a possibility always uhm well longer-term growth\nwill be from their globalisation drive\n\n\nI mean they have invested quite a lot in their overseas ventures\nand I expect this uh to be uh paying back in in by the end of this decade and\nit would be very significant when the pay back comes in\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay what impact is Singapore Telecom issue gonna to have on\nthe local market\n\n<$C> \n\nUh well as we have seen you know by today's market well it uh\nsort of uh you know drive up I mean uh uh interest in the Singapore uh market\n\n<$A> \n\nWill it increase the price of other G L Cs T K \n\n<$B> \n\nPossibly I think there're two ways to look at that one is\nthat Singapore Telecom is a fairly large-sized market kept stock Uh for

{"text": "<$A> \n\nNow you were interviewed sometime ago uh by the Business Times\nI believe\n\n\nI think it's called the conversation at Raffles and you made some\nvery very\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's right\n\n<$A> \n\nUh shall we say very remarkable statements if I might say and\nthe pardon me for putting on my glasses I would like to quote from what\nyou've said\n\n\nYou said that there are three priorities for the Malay Muslim\ncommunity in Singapore\n\n\nTo develop a Singapore brand of Islam to become active and even\nproactive players in forging an enhancing religious harmony in the country\nand to maximise the community's economic potential and you went on to include\nMalays to become must become more self confident to reach beyond the\ncommunity and to want to do better\n\n\nUhm I suppose these are fairly self-evident truths and they are very\nlogical and non-controversial\n\n\nBut what made you to put those principles in such stirring terms\n\n\nI mean is there a need for that uh uh uh in Malay community\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know while we've as as a community the Malay Muslim\ncommunity in Singapore has been through difficult times\n\n\nI saw it first to know that in in in in three decades actually post\nindependence\n\n\nWe first started off by feeling that you know that almost like\neverybody else owe us a living\n\n<$A> \n\nThat's rather strong oh boy\n\n<$B> \n\nYes and we thought that uh we're sort of sons of the soil we\nand and it's true actually not only of Singapore Malays but also practically\nof uh many developing countries achieving independence particularly in this\narea we felt that you know yah we we started this pointing\n\n<$A> \n\nSpecial yah\n\n<$B> \n\nwe started pointed fingers at others\n\n\nYou owe us this you need to do this for us and I I'm reminded\nactually when I was in Jakarta last week I had the same example I used\n\n\nI was reminded by a Javanese that you know when you point a finger\nsomeone it's only one finger but with three others pointing\n\n<$A> \n\npointing yourself yes\n\n<$B> \n\nyourself Well I was told by this Javanese that in in the Malay\nor Indonesian way of pointing a finger is this way where you point one finger\nat others but four\n\n<$A> \n\ninside\n\n<$B> \n\nfingers pointing at yourself and I and we start thinking that\nyou know is that really worthwhile every time pointing fingers at others\n\n\nBut let me quickly add to say that the Malay Muslim community has\nnever been uhm short on uh self-help activities\n\n\nBut uhm it took sometime before we felt that we must work within\nthe national framework\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nand and in the eighties when we felt we formed Mendeki\n\n\nIn fact it's a combination of many years of social activism which\nbought the various groups together\n\n\nAnd I think uhm Mendeki has shown what we can achieve and what we\ncan do if we sink our differences put our shoulders to the wheel and mind you\nhard work real hard work must come with it and and I made an example\n\n<$A> \n\nMay may may I cut in\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nMay I cut in on this one\n\n\nYou mention one phase which caught uh which caught my ears sink our\ndifferences\n\n\nAre there really significant differences or superficial differences\nwithin the community\n\n<$B> \n\nWell our history has been filled with that and fortunately we\ncame to realise that you know we just cannot go on uh with all this\ndifferences and I think unity is I think is uh critical\n\n\nAnd I'm glad we have that now more than before and that way we can\nactually maximise our resources\n\n<$A> \n\nI would like to sort of uh put something to you which may be a\nmisconception uh on the part of many people in Singapore including myself\nthat's that there is a perception of the fundamental conflict between\nreligion the Islamic religion of the Islam and modernity if you agree that\nadjustments uh and accommodation have to be made between these two factors\nwhether it is in fact uh possible to make successful uh uh integration in the\nlong term\n\n<$B> \n\nCan I uh preface my answer to that question by adding a point\nto my earlier answer and to say that there are problems\n\n\nI hope I have not painted a too rosy a picture about uh the process\nof upliftment and to say that there are problems\n\n\nAnd one of the problems is this question of reconciling differences\nin terms of perception\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nI think there's a serious gulf of perception between the\nMalays non-Malays and Muslims non-Muslims and the it's not because of\nreligion but it's because of how Muslims practice their religion\n\n\nIf I may cite an example\n\n\nI was in Libya in nineteen seventy-three\n\n\nI was a student there and I was invited to attend an international\nconference and we went there happily looking forward to a model of Islam\n\n<$A> \n\nA simple answer\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nLooking for a simple answer\n\n<$B> \n\nIn fact in fact it was proposed that uhm communism had failed\ncapitalism had failed and the answer is the third international theory called\nthe Green Book Islam\n\n<$A> \n\nOh yes yes I read about that yes\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd uh but I must say that we came back very disillusioned\nvery disappointed because even at that very conference we saw those\ncontradictions we saw those uhm weaknesses and mind you that's within the\nfold of Islamic brotherhood within the fold of Islamic conference youth\nconference full of hopes and expectations\n\n\nAnd I that made me feel why is it that we Muslims in Singapore must\nalways look to one particular area be it Middle East or somewhere else\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nfor that reference points\n\n\nI agree that the cradle <unclear> word </unclear> of Islamic\nrealisation was Mecca and for a long time Middle East was in fact the\nreference point\n\n\nBut we are different We are urban we are industrial we are global\n\n\nBut I'm not saying that we we don't have those cultural and\nreligious pools whether in the region or in the context of the international\nomma the Muslim\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I think uh with our own uh needs and our own challenges we\nmust find new reference points which will provide us those kind of answers\nwhere is more relevant to our need\n\n\nI'm not saying that uh they are so many Islam there is only one\nIslam\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nBut let me also add to say that why is it that we have\ndifferences in in practices in all over the Muslim world\n\n\nBut\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay okay we got to take a commercial break now but I like to\nleave something with you uh we can chat about it uh later on\n\n\nUhm perhaps what I'm trying to to to put to you is that surely\nthere is not a zero sum game as far as this is concerned I I would imagine\nthat even within the the boundaries of the Islamic faith uh one doesn't have\nto consider that if you in fact uh exist and succeed in the secular society\nyou do have to trade off something\n\n\nUh we'll come back to you later on\n\n\nAnd don't go away now we'll be back and where I'm gonna put that\nquestion to Zainal once again\n\n\nSee you later\n\n<$A> \n\nWelcome back before we took the commercial break I was putting\nthe question to Zanial as to whether religion and modernity is a zero sum\ngame May I have your views on this one Zainal\n\n<$B> \n\nLet me say that it must be a win win situation for us There's\nno other way\n\n\nThere will be difference some matter of perception some reality and\nuh I think we got to learn to manage those differences\n\n\nI say a win win situation because Islam calls for modernity Islam\ncalls for progress and Islam calls for tolerance\n\n\nYou know Islam is a very multi-cultural society in fact and I think\nuh I'd see no reason why Islam cannot uh succeed in a secular state like\nSingapore and I would like to say that Singapore gives us all the challenges\nto be good Muslims\n\n\nIt's not gonna be easy but the challenges are there and it's up to\nus actually to work\n\n<$A> \n\nThis is a very interesting set of uh facts\n\n\nWhy is it that the people in general don't seem to know these I\nmean from appearance anyway and from what one hear as in these these not the\nissues that are often front-ended to any discussion\n\n\nUh one tends to see much more uh uh back to the nature sort of\nthing But why why is that so\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I think uhm there is historical baggage we can't deny\nthat whether for cultural reasons racial reasons or religious reasons there\nhave been those there have been those times where it it really does not help\nBut uhm I'm optimistic and I'm confident that we will be able to make some\nheadway\n\n\nWe have been making headway and I think there's better willingness\non the part both or both Malays non-Malay Muslims and non-Muslims to reach\nout and learn from each other\n\n\nLet me site one another example if you don't mind Bob\n\n<$A> \n\nPlease please do\n\n<$B> \n\nI went to a forum\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nand I was on the panel and I was uh a Chinese gentleman stood\nup and say you know what the problem with you all is that you are Muslims\n\n\nIf you are Malays you are alright Can you imagine that\n\n<$A> \n\nDoes he really know what this is\n\n<$B> \n\nI I mean I thought at first it was very uh facetious but I\nthought and thought about it and I thought that this it reflects a very\nserious problem\n\n\nBecause I think quite a lot of non-Malays here see Malays as very\ngentle very easy going people\n\n\nBut how did they look at Islam\n\n\nHow do they look at Muslims\n\n\nPerhaps overseas fundamentalists radical militant\n\n<$A> \n\nThey're the guys who grab the headlines\n\n<$B> \n\nproblems everywhere\n\n<$A> \n\nI mean they're the guys who grab the the headlines you see but\nthere could be a certain amount of concern a certain amount of uh ignorance\n\n\nUhm perhaps this is the gulf that M U I S uh uh would you see this\nto be uh uh a gulf that M U I S should attempt to address\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know I if I may again uh site another anecdote you know\n\n\nI remember when the debate about G R C was on and I remember if I'm\nnot mistaken that Captain Ho who had made a submission and was saying that we\nshould not go for G R C because it gave the Malays or the minority groups a\ncertain political leverage and I remember Senior Minister or Prime Minister\nthen you know Prime Minister you ask him where do you live\n\n\nI think is was Hougang if I am not mistaken and he said do you have\nMalay friends\n\n\nDo you know the Malays and the Muslims and he said no\n\n\nAnd I think that's the point and I feel uh the more of Muslims\nreach out to understand what the others feel and similarly the if more\nnon-Muslims try to reach out and understand how Muslims and Malays feel I\nthink there can be that greater uh understanding\n\n<$A> \n\nZanial if I may out to push you a little bit on the last\ncomment that you made I would like to share with you perhaps rightly or\nwrongly two perceptions\n\n\nFirst is that the Malay community uh has been marginalised in the\ndevelopment of the Singapore society\n\n\nThe other thing is that ever since Singapore's independence some\nthirty-eight odd years ago the rest of the society has in fact moved forward\n\n\nDo you think that the last thirty years have been wasted\n\n<$B> \n\nMarginalised may be too strong a word\n\n\nYou know I remember that quite a number of Malay friends of mine\nwho were very upset when uh we say that the Malays were not in the mainstream\n\n\nThey feel that the Malays have been part of the mainstream\n\n<$A> \n\nYes", "subdomain":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nWelcome to the programme Mister David Marshall\n\n<$B> \n\nThank you\n\n<$A> \n\nMay I sort of begin our conversation by drawing on one of the\nuhm the comments that you made in the short video clip uh just at that before\nit concluded\n\n\nHave the years indeed mellowed you\n\n<$B> \n\nWell the fire in the belly is embers now but it can always be\nfan to flame by injustice\n\n\nI have a deep emotional desire for human justice\n\n\nUh a deep feeling for respect for my fellow human beings\n\n\nThat has not altered\n\n\nMy capacity to seek to develop these ideas into a practical\nimprovement of conditions of course is very much less and with age a few\nwindows closed\n\n<$A> \n\nYou have held some very strong views of what you feel\nSingapore and Singaporean should be and the if I may uh take the liberty of\nquoting an interview from an interview you had in nineteen eighty-eight\n\n\nUhm you said and if I may quote you Mister Marshall we have not\ncome of age\n\n\nWe are adolescents\n\n\nWe have ability but no grace\n\n\nWe exaggerate our importance and forget that we are no more than a\npinpoint on the globe\n\n\nWe have a long way to go and I heard that we go that road in\nhumility\n\n\nI think these are sentiments <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nWhat drove you to express those opinions in nineteen eighty-eight\n\n<$B> \n\nWell the the realities of the situation then\n\n\nI was seeking to tell our people look this is how it is today but\nbecause there are defects this is how it can be improved\n\n\nWhether I was right or wrong is irrelevant\n\n\nI was honest about it\n\n\nAnd let's be fair in the last eight years I think we've taken a\ngiant step\n\n\nI was until Thursday I was Dean of the Commonwealth Ambassadors in\nParis and there were every month we had lunch and I meet about twenty-three\ntwenty-four ambassadors most of them from the third world and the respect for\nSingapore was a joy a real joy\n\n\nSo we're no longer an uh irrelevant pinpoint\n\n\nWe are a very relevant a global city\n\n\nThat's a long way to go As for graciousness in my embassy I get\nofficers constantly changing\n\n\nAnd my impression is that the officers who have come to Paris\nrecently are far more sophisticated with a a growing sense of the\ngraciousness of living Uh my minister Wong Kan Seng gave me a dinner to\nfarewell me\n\n\nHe and his Misses Wong Brigadier-General Yeo and his wife heads of\ngovernment depart all the departments of the foreign office and a beautiful\nsilver <unclear> word </unclear> to farewell me ten years ago eight years ago\n\n\nThat would not have happened spending public money on a function\nthat produced no money\n\n\nBut he understood the meaning uh and the worth the worthwhileness\nof a gracious act\n\n\nThat's important\n\n<$A> \n\nYes yes\n\n\nBut but sorry for interrupting but would this be applicable\ngenerally to all Singaporeans I mean we still see a lot of grabbing out\n\n\nWe still see many manifestations of self-interest and surely that\nis that goes against the uh the the perception of gracious to be honest\n\n<$B> \n\nUh not self-interest\n\n\nSelf-interest is part of human nature\n\n\nYou know Mao Zi Tong tried to change it and failed\n\n\nNo no no let let's get our picture right\n\n\nYes we are the new ridge okay\n\n\nUh yes we haven't got the sophistication fully yet\n\n\nBut we are getting there\n\n\nOur people are a very decent people and a very reasonable people\nand frankly I'm delighted to be born in Singapore\n\n\nI like them they've been wonderful to me\n\n\nSo when you talk of graciousness yes there's a lot of uh scrabbling\nfor money\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's it's a I think it's the fault of the government\n\n\nThey keep insisting on merit and and and uh uhm merit is uh\nexpressed in uh the medals in my chest and the money in my bank account\n\n\nBut uh let's be fair again you know\n\n\nThe other night Community Chest Centre I had Goh Chok Tong speak of\ncompassion and solidarity\n\n\nWe're coming along I mean George Yeo last week was it uh he put\nforward uh uh a very heroic plan for uh development for cultural activity of\nour people\n\n\nSo I see these glimmers uh of our understanding that now we have\nfilled the rice bowl we must move on to the quality of living beyond our\nphysical needs\n\n\nAnd frankly as I see our people they enjoy they like they\nappreciate and they accept uh tendencies to greater respect for the human\nindividual for the graces of living for the grace of human relations\n\n\nI'm I'm I'm not uh I'm not pessimistic I'm much more optimistic\ntoday than I was eight years ago\n\n<$A> \n\nWouldn't there be any pitfalls that we have got to be worried\nabout\n\n<$B> \n\nThere are two challenges\n\n\nOne is racial harmony and look I I'm a critic of the P A P but in\nfairness they have done a wonderful job of softening antagonisms of fair play\nfor all communities and so long as this tradition lasts of respect for\nminority groups and there is respect for minor then we're alright\n\n\nThere is an emphasis too great an emphasis but then maybe I'm\nunSingaporean in this on money values For me you know I say after eighty-five\nyears of living I believe that human relations are far far more satisfying\nthan the money in my bank and the medals on my chest and there I have them\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n\nI'm afraid we got to go for a short break now Mister Marshall but\nbefore we go I will just like to uh leave you with a thought that in view of\nthe present stage of development of Singapore we are subject to more open\ninfluences and one of those uh influences that are now prevade that is now\nprevading the world is this question of human rights and human freedom\nindividual freedom\n\n\nBut uh we'll take a break now and we'll come back and take up this\nquestion\n\n\nDon't go away now we'll be back to discuss and continue with this\nconversation\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's a global question\n\n<$A> \n\nWelcome back\n\n\nBefore we took the break Mister Marshall I raised the point of\nhuman rights and personal freedom\n\n\nI think this is a point which confronts a lot of those of us in\nSingapore when we read about the sort of <unclear> word </unclear> that go on\ninternationally but what exactly how do you see this question of human rights\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's a global question affects more than Singapore\n\n\nAs I see it historically the Asian approach is founded on Confucian\nthought mainly\n\n\nTwo thousand five hundred years ago Confucius had such giant task\nof trying to bring order to a chaos across the vast country\n\n\nSo he evolved a philosophy which is quite essential for the time to\nbring order is a philosophy of primacy of the community's welfare\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nrespect for authority\n\n\nLegitimate though it was for the time and place it has led to\nimperial repression\n\n\nIt has led to communist repression\n\n\nIt is the father of dictatorships because of course who is the\njudge of the community's welfare except our bosses and they love the idea\nrespect authority and uh if they don't have opposition as because as these\nmajesty uh they they they lose a sight of the real individual's welfare and\nit therefore emphasis on community's interest exclusively is unhealthy at\nleast to dictatorship and authoritarian rule\n\n\nOn the other side of the world the Western nations were leaven by\nthe Pseudo Christian concept of respect for the individual\n\n\nAnd from the concept of respect for the individual flowed democracy\nand democracy gave freedom to grow to his full height\n\n\nAnd what a magnificent achievement Compare the result of the two\nculture\n\n\nBut let's face it excess of individualism has meant fragmentation\n\n\nIt has meant uh egoism run <unclear> word </unclear> riot\n\n\nUh it has meant uh uh quite unpleasant results in many parts\nespecially in the United States which are so high so openly advertised\n\n\nI see the picture as one where we must marry the two concepts There\nmust be both respect for community welfare as a framework and respect for the\nindividual and perhaps more respect for the individual than emphasis on the\ncommunity's welfare\n\n\nAnd frankly I I I I see this government rather uh\n\n<$A> \n\nYou think it's coming together here\n\n<$B> \n\nThere is an attempt in Singapore it's slow-moving uh it's\nhesitant but there's a slow-moving away from excessive community emphasis on\ncommunity welfare to movement to respect for the individual\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nI'd like to live longer enough to see the result of this\nexperiment maybe we can show the world how to do it\n\n<$A> \n\nYou feel that all the necessary ingredients are in fact in\nplace\n\n<$B> \n\nWe have an intelligent government\n\n\nWe have reasonably perceptive government even if they sometime seem\nrepressive and authoritarian they're not stupid\n\n\nUh they know what we're about and uh frankly it's more than a\nquestion of vote getting\n\n\nI believe they're totally sincere in seeking our welfare\n\n\nI mean they're integrity shows it and uh yes I think that the\ningredient are here\n\n\nThe evolution may be slow but maybe a cautious approach is a wise\none of quiet evolution\n\n<$A> \n\nYes yes of course one is evidently influenced by the accesses\none could see in other societies where this thing has gone a little out of\nhand\n\n\nBut perhaps we can uh uh sort of uh uh come down to the next level\nor so to speak of of of uh individual freedom which is of course uhm another\ndifficult uh area to touch on\n\n<$B> \n\nMister Iau when my friends speak about that I say tell me\nwhere are we lacking in freedom\n\n\nWhat freedom are we lacking in\n\n\nWow they say have you become P A P\n\n\nI said look I'm not pro P A P\n\n\nI seek to have a sense of balance an honest balance\n\n\nLook every time I come back to Singapore I feel like rig and\nwrinkle asleep for decades and suddenly I say is this Colossal City my\nSingapore\n\n\nAre these vibrant dynamic people with vision and courage my fellow\ncitizens\n\n\nHow is this happen here in forty years You know why do we have to\nemphasis the pimples on our face instead of looking and praising the\nmagnificent rippling muscles of our Olympic athlete's body\n\n\nYou know I won't to refuse to kiss a beautiful woman if she has a\npimple on her face\n\n\nIf I can have a government that is honest and they are honest\n\n\nIf I can have a government that's able Look around you even Benjay\nRatnam will have to confess they are able\n\n\nIf I can have a government that's caring and I think it's moving\nthat way beyond the caring for the general welfare and uh rice bowl caring\nfor the human individual and his own weaknesses well I'm a very lucky man\n\n\nLook I'm not perfect\n\n\nI mean I've got sort of applying for a halo why should I expect my\nministers to be perfect\n\n\nSure they make silly blunders\n\n\nI mean for for me that's business about chewing gum honestly that\nembarrassed me acutely\n\n\nHow could they\n\n\nHow could these very able people discern to such an absurdity\n\n\nHow could you use a forty pound hammer to crack a walnut\n\n\nUh okay so they make mistakes they make uh blunders\n\n\nBut what is the overall picture like\n\n\nThe overall picture makes me proud to be a Singapore\n\n\nUnfortunately the publicity is all on our the pimples on our face\nand I would frankly uh to have a session with our university students who\ncomplain in the dark you know uh ruthless uh whatever\n\n\nOkay tell me where do we lack in freedom\n\n\nWe've got a declaration of human rights by by by the United\nNations\n\n\nWhich paragraph have we transgressed\n\n<$A> \n\nHave we violated\n\n\nYes \n\n<$B> \n\nLet's have it openly Don't be afraid for heaven sake what\nare you afraid of If you're

{"text": "<$A> \n\nGood morning\n\n\nI am Christina Eng\n\n\nIn AM Singapore today conservation by private home owners a new\nconstitution for South Africa and consultancy work in the library services\n\n\nIf you think your home is of historical or architectural importance\nyou could get help to conserve it the Urban Redevelopment Authority or URA is\nstarting a scheme called conservation initiated by private owners\n\n\nBasically this means that if you're if you own a building which you\nthink is worth preserving the URA may offer help such as reaping\nredevelopment charges\n\n\nUsually conservation projects are initiated by the URA so why then\ndo they want private owners to make the first move now\n\n\nKoh Eng Jin Manager of the URA conservation and urban design unit\nexplains to Loh Wee Chin\n\n<$B> \n\nNo we all know that uhm besides the that areas that has been\ngazetted for conservation and the additional areas uhm announced today uhm\nthroughout the entire island there are other buildings either in groups or in\na on a street block basis which has architectural and historical merit worthy\nof conservation\n\n\nNow we would like to encourage owners who own such property to come\nforward to URA and say I have a building I think it has merit and it it is\nworthy to be considered for conservation and I like to participate in this\nconservation scheme\n\n\nAnd we would help to facilitate to make an assessment and\nevaluation of the building and if it's found worthy of conservation we can\nthen facilitate the owners to go through the process of having their\nproperties gazetted for conservation\n\n<$C> \n\nBut many owners might not even realise that their buildings\nare worth conserving after all they might just think it's a dirty old\nbuilding\n\n\nHow would they know if uhm what they live in or what they work in\nis worth conserving\n\n<$B> \n\nNow we have a pamphlet that has been published and within the\npamphlet the we gave an idea of what has been our past effort so that will in\na way inform the public to you know in a way they can look at all the\nbuildings that has been gazetted and in fact we do have a good number for\nnumbers of building that has been restored so I think the owners could use\nthat as a point of reference to to evaluate in fact whether their building is\nworthy of conservation\n\n<$C> \n\nSo you mean just like say walk around Singapore and see what\nhas been conserved already and see if their own building matches up\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I think precisely they can walk around town and they can\nsee the buildings being beautifully restored\n\n\nIn fact uhm I think most of us would not be able to realise that\nhow beautiful the buildings are because they have not been maintained over\nthe years\n\n\nThey look very run-down but if you look at those buildings that has\nalready been restored you will discover that the beauty that you have never\nyou know realised before\n\n<$C> \n\nHow many people have uhm come have offered their building for\nconservation so far voluntarily\n\n<$B> \n\nUp to date we do receive a lot of enquiries\n\n\nEach month we get about a hundred enquiries to enquire whether\ntheir buildings are worthy of conservation uhm and we do have instances where\nthe owners came forward and they say I think my building is worthy of\nconservation and we have encouraged them to conserve\n\n\nIn fact there is one such case it at Mayer Road a bungalow house\nVictorian style bungalow\n\n\nThe plot of land under the master plan is allowed to redevelop as\nan apartment\n\n\nNow the owner has conserved the bungalow and next to the bungalow\nhe has uhm proposed a block of apartments and he can use his bungalow for\ncommunal facilities or even redesign the interior of the bungalow to make\nthem into apartment units\n\n<$A> \n\nKoh Eng Jin on the conservation of private houses\n\n\nStill to come on AM Singapore proposal for a new constitution in\nSouth Africa and a look at the new Shell marketing centre\n\n\nSouth African President F.W. de Klerk has proposed a constitution\nthat will for the first time in the country history give Blacks the right to\nvote\n\n\nIt however denies them political domination instead it ensures\nblack-white par sharing through all levels of government\n\n\nThe plan will also see the creation of two houses in parliament the\nfirst house would be made up of elected representatives proportionate to\ntheir party's share of votes the second house which will have veto powers\nover the first will be made up of an equal number of representatives from\nSouth Africa's nine regions\n\n\nThe South African I'm sorry the African National Congress South\nAfrica's biggest black political grouping has rejected the model claiming it\nwould result in a weak parliament\n\n\nThey also believe that the system of power-sharing would\neffectively give whites the veto but are these things valid or is the ANC\nsimply piqued at the prospect of never having majority rule\n\n\nA short while ago\n\n\nSansita Badachajee was on the line with Saer Govinder a journalist\nbased in Johannesburg\n\n\nShia asked him first whether there was any significance in the\ntiming of the proposed constitution\n\n<$D> \n\nYou see over the past uh few months the right-wing in South\nAfrica has been carrying out a uhm an intensive campaign against the National\nParty accusing the National Party of selling out to white people in the\ncountry and of a giving in to majority rule and of giving in to ANC and so I\nthink de Klerk in order to in order to try to uhm you know dilute or defuse\nthe the opposition against him uhm you know as as reveal the constitutional\nproposals which uh which in a way what you call tries to provide some kind of\nsecurity for the white people and and and the he hopes that in this way that\nhe will be able to soothe the nerves and the fears of the of the white\nminority but of course you know the conservative party has also rejected the\nde Klerk's constitutional proposals and has once again accused him of uh\nleading the country to uhm to black majority rule\n\n\nSo you\n\n\n so you see that uh de Klerk uhm uh you know while\nwhile trying to win the support of the right-wing he's he's still being you\nknow criticized and condemned by the right-wing\n\n<$E> \n\nWell de Klerk doesn't seem to have much luck with the ANC\neither they've rejected his proposal but why have they done so and what are\nthey looking for in in this new draft constitution\n\n<$D> \n\nThe ANC believes firstly that it it wants a <unclear> word\n</unclear> parliament whereby what you call the first chamber will be elected\non a one-person one-vote system which which is also uhm you know proposed by\nthe national party and that uh the representation in the first house of\nparliament will be by proportional representation and the both the national\nparty and the ANC support that but the only difference is that the ANC does\nagree with the national party insofar as the second chamber the devolution of\npower to the regions and the the uh granting of more power to the people who\nown properties rather than people who don't own properties\n\n\nUhm the the ANC believes that these are all mechanisms being\ncontrived by the national party in order to deny the the majority party in\nany future and free elections to to form the government and to what you call\noperate freely without any uh restrictions\n\n<$E> \n\nUhm President de Klerk has said that not all blacks supported\nthe ANC and that he claims that millions and millions of blacks bet his party\nin preventing too much power in the hands of one party or one leader is this\nclaim an empty one\n\n<$D> \n\nWell that's what he likes to believe I mean uh for instance uh\nI I mean he uh the the the the Incata Zulu Party does not support the ANC but\nthe Incata Zulu Party uhm is just to uh achieve popularity and the and some\nof his people I mean they don't have the majority support of all the Zulus\n\n\nI mean uh President de Klerk would like to believe that uh millions\nof blacks support him but I mean the only way that uh uh we could uh we could\ncome to a situation where where political parties uhm registered and\nsupported by is is through free and fray elections and this is what uh the\nANC and other progressive organisations in South Africa are calling for\n\n<$A> \n\nMr Govinder on the demands of the African National Congress\nregarding the new constitution yesterday the Congress of People's Deputies\nand the USSR rejected a draft of the union treaty sending it back to the\ndrawing board for more discussion\n\n\nThis came about after Russia and the Ukraine submitted further\namendments to the original bill\n\n\nRussian President Boris Yeltsin in the last minute move surprised\nlaw-makers with an alternative proposal for setting up the much debated\nconfederation\n\n\nYeltsin claimed that the proposed legislative body would leave\nRussia with a minority voice in a transitional parliament dominated by\nconservative governments of other republics\n\n\nBut why has Yeltsin made his proposal at such a last minute just\nwhen congress was set to vote on it\n\n\nA question Pek Siok Lian asked civitologist Tron Gilberg earlier\nthis morning \n\n\nTG \n\n<$F> \n\nBut how do you think the congress and the republics will\nrespond to his proposal\n\n\nWhat about Gorbachev then how do you think he is likely to react\n\n\n\nTG \n\n<$F> \n\nWell uhm the Russian republic <unclear> word </unclear> has\nalso threatened to secede should the full-scale legislature not agree to\ntheir alternative proposal\n\n\nHow great an influence will this threat have on the response of\nGorbachev and the other republics do you think \n\n\nTG \n\n<$A> \n\nSo civitologist Tron Gilberg bringing the time to three nine\nminutes past seven here on AM Singapore\n\n\nWith the opening of its hundred and fifteen million dollar\nmarketing centre oil company Shell has a three billion dollar stake in\nSingapore the installation takes over the inland distribution function of\nproducts like petrol and diesel\n\n\nIt's linked to the Pulau Bukom refinery by submarine pipelines\nwhich makes it possible to transport 2000 tons of oil in 6 to 7 hours an\noperation which used to take a whole day\n\n\nThe centre also boasts of being environment-friendly\n\n\nShell's marketing Director Sim Siok Lim describes to Jane Ong some\nof the technology employed to achieve this such as double bottom tanks\n\n<$G> \n\nAll the tanks uh sit on a a second bottom which is made of a a\nthick membrane uh of plastic material and this thick membrane is actually\nlaid in the ground uh beneath the foundation of the tank themselves for the\ntanks are built uh and there are the membrane is so designed that should\nthere be a leak of any of the tank the oil does not seep beyond the top of\nthis membrane so that from that point of view it is it's safe\n\n<$H> \n\nYou also have uhm an equipment called the total ball plate\ninterceptor which cost more than one million dollars what does that do\n\n<$G> \n\nAs you know in uh oil in installation of this nature before\nany water flows out of the installation uh all the drain water and surface\nwater uh has to be channelled through uh an approved uh design of interceptor\nto make sure that any oil that's present in the water is separated from the\nwater before the water is allowed to exit the installation\n\n\nNow for this installation we have actually incorporated into it a\nthe latest design of such interceptor and that is called a tutable plate\ninterceptor\n\n\nThe feature of this filtable plate interceptor is that uh it has\nthe capability of uh streaming off as it were uh the oil so deeply that the\neffluent water that eventually flows out has has got an absolute minimal\namount of oil present in it if any at all \n\n<$H> \n\nYou also have uhm bottom loading siligentries\n\n\nWhat is that supposed to do how safe is that for the environment\n\n<$G> \n\nThe bottom loading of tank trucks is the uh the latest method\nfor loading tank trucks\n\n\nThe advantage of bottom loading as uh against the uh more\nconventional method of loading uh tank trucks via the top is that in bottom\nloading we are able to construct a vapour return line to the storage tanks\nand in that way as we load the tank trucks no vapour escapes into the\nsurrounding atmosphere are there any other safety measures that you've built\ninto this installation to make sure that it it is environmentally friendly\nyes indeed uh other safety measures uh would include the way that the\nsubmarine pipelines are are designed and constructed for instance and uh the\npipelines for instance are are laid well below uh PSA's reserved taps uh for\nthe channels through which the pieplines pass uh the pipelines are also\nprotected by a very thick layer of of rock armoury uh which is designed to\nprevent uh accidental uh dragging by anchors and uh this layer of armoury is\ndesigned to withstand accidental dragging by anchors of ships up to a quarter\nmillion tons in dead weight Sim Siok Lim talking about the environment\nfriendly measures at the new Shell marketing centre many private\norganisations have a need to develop in-house libraries for their own\nspecific needs but most try to do it themselves using their own unqualified\nstaff Salary Turner a library service consultant does not advocate such a\npractice she gives her reasons why so what services does a library consultant\nprovide and how can these small organisations get started and that was

{"text": "<$A> \n\nIn AM Singapore today President Bush intends to send planes to\nIraq\n\n\nWe ask if he's over-reacting and more varied ECA programs for our\nschools\n\n\nWhat do the principals think all these and more in the next twenty\nminutes\n\n\nHello I'm Shanji Dabaracharji\n\n\nDisbelief outrage and anger that's how Iraq has reacted to the news\nthat President Bush had authorised US military forces to escort United\nNations' team inspecting Iraqi weapon sites\n\n\nThe forces are now on alert ready to be sent if Iraq shows no\nflexibility over conditions over which UN teams can be allowed to inspect the\nsites\n\n\nThe American leader however has said that he did not expect action\nto be necessary against Iraq\n\n\nThe announcement came amid confusion about whether the United States\nhad definitely decided to send additional air forces to Saudi Arabia\n\n\nPresident Bush had said that the aircraft could be used to provide\ncover for UN inspection teams searching for weapons of mass destruction\n\n\nHowever as no one had expected the Iraqis to hand details of their\nsecurity forces over on on a silver platter\n\n\nDid President Bush then exhaust all possibilities or were there\nother options he overlooked\n\n\nDurik Kipper is a research scholar specialising on US-Iraq affairs\nwith the American think-tank Brooklyn institution \n\n\nDK \n\n<$B> \n\nWell according to the UN secretary General the Iraqis had been\nshowing some signs of flexibility and only last week they had backed down\nover the use of their helicopters\n\n\nDo you think that perhaps President Bush has over-reacted \n\n\nDK \n\n<$B> \n\nThe UN inspection team that has been in Iraq has discovered\nthat Iraq's weapon capability is at a much higher stage than anyone expected\n\n\nDo you think that this this discovery has influenced America's\ndecision to some extent \n\n\nDK \n\n<$B> \n\nWell the Iraqis have been rather creative in hiding their\nmilitary equipment even if force was to be used\n\n\nDo you think that Iraq can be stripped of its military potential\n\n<$A> \n\nDurik Kipper of the Brooklyn institution on the line from\nAmerica\n\n\nAnd from the possibility of fighting Iraq team once again to a\ncountry split by a long-running violence in Yugoslavia the warring factions\nappears to have ignored the cease-fire which came into effect at six o'clock\nyesterday\n\n\nIn fact fighting is reported in many areas\n\n\nThe broker of this present cease-fire former British foreign\nsecretary Lord Carrington has asked for twenty-four hours before writing off\nthis attempt\n\n\nAdrian Ong asks professor Adney Berlonski on whether they should\nwrite up the cease-fire or whether they should give time as Lord Carrington\nsuggested \n\n\nAB \n\n<$B> \n\nCroatia's Defence Minister has just resigned today uh\npresumably because there are some differences in lieu\n\n\nDo you see a split in <unclear> word </unclear> over how they\nshould deal with the Serbians \n\n\nAB \n\n<$B> \n\nHow much longer do you think the Croatian army can hold out\nagainst the Yugoslavia's federal forces before giving in to Serbian demands\n\n\n\nAB \n\n<$B> \n\nYou spoke earlier about a split in Zagreb is there a similar\nsplit in Serbia \n\n\nAB \n\n<$B> \n\nThis is the fourth attempt at cease-fighting\n\n\nCroatia has the past relationship between the Croats and the Serbs\nbeen so bitter that they simply cannot trust each other \n\n\nAB \n\n<$A> \n\nProfessor Adney Bolongski on the line from London\n\n\nAnd the time now is seven twenty-three\n\n\nComing up next here in AM Singapore investing in Germany\n\n\nTo encourage investment in the five eastern states of Germany the\nGerman government is providing a high level of financial support while the\nfederal government gives incentives through taxation and the price of real\nestate\n\n\nLocal governments provide support through local structures and\nfacilities\n\n\nThis same support is given to all investors both domestic and\nforeign but wouldn't this put German companies at an advantage given that\nthey speak the same language and share a similar culture\n\n\nDoctor Henning Forsherald president of the <unclear> word\n</unclear> or the other house of parliament agrees but he gives but he gives\nChristina Eng the reasons for doing so \n\n\nHF \n\n<$C> \n\nWell we have had uhm previous calls for investment in East\nGermany but so far no single Singaporean investment has been made what do you\nthink is hold Singapore investors back \n\n\nHF \n\n<$C> \n\nWell you're trying to promote uh German investment in the\neastern states but you're also trying trying to promote German investment in\nthe Asian pacific why \n\n\nHF \n\n<$A> \n\nDoctor Henning Forsherald president of the <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n\nNext on AM Singapore ECA programs for our schools\n\n\nFour hundred principals gathered at the ECA seminar yesterday to\nexamine the policies and future directions for extra-curricular activities in\nSingapore schools\n\n\nThey hope to develop a rich and varied ECA program that will add\ncolour to school life and help students build character and achieve personal\ngrowth\n\n\nDr Tay Eng Soon Senior Minister of State for Education was the\nGuest at honour at the seminar yesterday\n\n\nKaren Won asked him wouldn't that wouldn't putting more emphasis on\nECA be adding pressure on the child\n\n<$D> \n\nI don't think so\n\n\nUh my observation is that those students who really do well uh in\nlife are people who have uh good academic certificates but who also have a\ngood ECA track record\n\n\nUh they manage to do both and in fact some of them tell me that\nbecause of their ECA activities uhm uh they are able to relax they're even\nable to do better in their academic work you know they don't become stale in\nother words\n\n<$E> \n\nWhat about the slower students who are already having problem\ncoping with their uh formal curriculum\n\n<$D> \n\nWell I think the balance has been struck at every level but it\nis possible even at for average students to pay attention to both and do\nbetter\n\n\nUhm just imagine a student who is not very good in his studies and\nyou do nothing but lock him up in a room to do his studies right\n\n\nDo you think that student will somehow improve in his studies\n\n\nI think he will become very bored very stale his mind will be\nswitched off\n\n\nBut if you allow him daily to have a little bit of uhm uh healthy\nsporting activity his mind will be refreshed\n\n\nI think he'll come back to his studies with more interest\n\n<$E> \n\nWhat would you tell parents who think that ECA is robbing\ntheir children's studying time\n\n<$D> \n\nI would advise them that uhm they should think of the total\ndevelopment of their children\n\n\nUh there are many examples of children who do extremely well in\ntheir academic studies who later on in life do not do well uh in the sense\nthat their personalities are incomplete they lack self-confidence uhm and\neven though they may have got good grades they are not effective as adults\nand that's a real pity\n\n\nIf they had uh balanced programs in school where studies on one\nhand is important but uh at the same time they give make effort in ECA uh in\nECA activities and develop their character their personality I think they\nmake more successful adults\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd that was Dr Tay Eng Soon talking about the importance of\nECA\n\n\nHis view is shared by two principals Mr Jumaat Mazdawood of\nClementi Town Primary and Mrs Pearl Goh from Ping Yi Secondary School\n\n\nIn this report Zainal Abidin they will be implementing this new\nvision of ECA in their schools\n\n<$F> \n\nMr Jumaat Mazdawud said that the suggestion of offering a\nwider exposure of ECA is especially best for primary school students\n\n\nHe believes that these students should be exposed to a variety of\nECA so that they could make a more prudent choice of what to specialise in at\nthe secondary school level and this means opening up the extra-curricular\nactivities to lower primary school students as well however in this case\nthere would be some restrictions\n\n<$G> \n\nIt is quite obvious that uh if we were to allow the lower\nprimary pupils access to ECA it must be some kind of activity where it may\nnot be too strenuous for them 'cos uh their body structure I think limits the\nthe kind of activities that are available to them\n\n\nBut I do believe pupils at primary two or even at primary one if\nthey do have the the the uh need and that that interest uh together with\nparental support uh in ECA activities such as uh music uh dancing uh and a\nhost of others which uhm may be of interest to these younger pupils\n\n\nThey should be given all help and all assistance to participate in\nthese kind of activities\n\n<$F> \n\nThe range of activities and research will include the more\nspecialised ones such as mountaineering ballet sea sport and music that's\nvery much in demand now\n\n\nIn such cases professional help would be necessary and this would\nmean a definite increase in the cost of running ECA programs\n\n\nWho'd pay for this increase in costs\n\n<$G> \n\nNow hopefully with the release of Medisave parents may now\nfind it a little bit easier to group together via the school system uh to\nemploy maybe specialised instructors uh which may be available outside uh the\nschool system and which we can more or less work together uh to garner these\nresources for the benefit of the pupils\n\n\nAt present the schools are subsidising almost all the activities\nthat are provided in the schools but if they were to engage more specialised\ninstructors it would imply that or rather it would mean that the cost of\ninstruction would go up and uh for a school with limited funds to embark on\nsuch a project I would expect uh some input uh to be allowed uh from on the\npart of parents to subsidise or part of the the training program for the\npupils\n\n<$F> \n\nIn ensuring that cost of the ECA program do not go up\nunnecessarily Mrs Pearl Goh principal of Ping Yi Secondary School said she\nwould rely on a wide-ranging skills of the teachers in improving her school's\nECA programs\n\n\nThis she said would also reduce the undue stress of the teachers if\nthey have to learn and instruct new skills not familiar to them\n\n<$H> \n\nWhat we do in Ping Yi is to exploit potential within our\nteachers\n\n\nThey come actually loaded with gifts and skills it's a matter of\nfinding out and deploying them\n\n\nSo what we try to offer the students uh areas that the teachers\ncould offer in terms of let's say an enrichment program uh teaching Japanese\nor teaching the boys how to cook and manage a home uhm plastic making\nartifacts these are some of the things that my teachers have so I've not gone\nto any extra expense of having them trained\n\n\nWe pick out these and then we try to structure program for the\nstudents\n\n<$F> \n\nBut Pearl admitted undoubtedly there will be an increase in\nthe ECA expense if we are going to provide a more generous spread of\nactivities to the students\n\n\nAccording to her ECA expenditure that exceeds the 500 dollars a\nyear given by the Ministry of Education is covered through her hard work of\ngetting donations from organisations like the Shaw Foundation and when I ask\nher what more she thinks the ministry should offer she said\n\n<$H> \n\nWell I feel that the Ministry of Education could provide some\nof the more expensive items for example in some health clubs they've this\nvery sophisticated machinery where you could have a a group of students at\nthe different posts uhm keeping fit at the same time\n\n\nI would love to have <unclear> word </unclear> and this machinery\nand support uh machinery for the children to do to keep fit on rainy days for\nexample when they can't do their P.E. outside they could go to this room and\nthe teachers and and and I could also enjoy it\n\n<$F> \n\nFinally when asked if she foresees any problem in implementing\nthis new expanded ECA program she confidently replied\n\n<$H> \n\nYou give us the machinery we will schedule it\n\n\nI think principals are known to be very very creative and very\ninnovative\n\n<$A> \n\nMrs Pearl Goh so it looks like students at all levels can look\nforward to a more enriching ECA program in the years to come and with that\nwe've come to the end of today's program\n\n\nOn behalf of my producer Adrain Ong I'm Shanji Dabaracharji\n\n\nJoin us again tommorrow at seven fifteen am over radio one till\nthen have a nice day", "subdomain":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nOn AM Singapore we'll be exploring the approach to this year's\nspeak mandarin campaign five ways to save the environment and a French\nminister's view on trade and tariffs\n\n\nGood morning I'm Elynur Nair\n\n\nBut first patriotic missiles have been deployed to Saudi Arabia from\nthe United States along with one thousand three hundred soldiers trained to\nuse them\n\n\nThis comes at a time when tension is high in the region where Iraq\ncontinues to detain the UN team hunting for evidence of its nuclear programs\n\n\nSo far only two of the US-gulf war allies have responded to the\nsituation\n\n\nThe British and Israeli prime ministers have both called for the\ndestruction of Iraq's nuclear capabilities\n\n\nOther allies especially the middle-easterns are keeping quiet on\nthis issue\n\n\nTo find out why Christina Eng calls Dr Paul Rogers of Bradford\nUniverisity earlier this morning \n\n\nPR \n\n<$B> \n\nBut by keeping quiet can they defuse the tension it doesn't\nhelp any does it \n\n\nPR \n\n<$B> \n\nWell Saudi Arabia is getting ready for a major crisis by\naccepting the patriot missiles at this time does this mean that uhm it is\ntaking sides with the US \n\n\nPR \n\n<$B> \n\nWell if them no eastern allies don't want to take sides can\nthey be relied on to rally around the US once again\n\n\nShould force be decided on by the security council \n\n\nPR \n\n<$A> \n\nThat was Dr Paul Rogers on support for the US from its allies\n\n\nThe time now is nineteen minutes past seven and next we look at\nnews occurring on the home front speak mandarin in mandarin\n\n\nWell it's that time of the year again to brush up on your mandarin\nthat is if you're a Chinese Singaporean and haven't been speaking mandarin\nfor the twelve years the campaign's been on\n\n\nIf you're one of them the organisers hope that this time round\nChinese mythological figures a lighthearted approach and even some humour\nwill convince you to speak more mandarin and through it better appreciate\nChinese culture\n\n\nFor the theme this year is that mandarin is more than just a\nlanguage\n\n\nThis is a change from last year's slogan if you're a Chinese make a\nstatement in mandarin that raised quite a few eyebrows\n\n\nWith that in mind how careful have the organisers been to avoid\nanother issue\n\n\nDeputy Director of publicity and promotions at the ministry of\ninformation and the arts Henry Ng explains\n\n<$C> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> in this year we're taking a\ndifferent approach the approach we take is a light-hearted approach it won't\nbe offending anybody\n\n\nWe want to appeal to people's urge to learn the Chinese culture and\nChinese heritage through the use of mandarin that means if you know mandarin\nyou speak mandarin you appreciate Chinese culture better\n\n<$D> \n\nHave you taken soundings from the other committees to see if\nthe they feel that this year's slogan is perhaps uhm as sensitive as last\nyear's\n\n<$C> \n\nI think uh in the committee to promote the use of mandarin we\nhave uh members who are English educated\n\n\nTheir views have been sought and they have given an input uh in\ncoming out with this slogan so I think that this year's slogan won't be as\ncontroversial as the past year\n\n<$D> \n\nWhere have you consulted uhm members from the other committees\n\n<$C> \n\nI think we do uh we have consulted uh other MPs uh and also\nthrough the MPs to tell uh community so I am confident that this year's\nslogan should be acceptable to all\n\n<$D> \n\nThis year's campaign like that of the past couple of years has\ntended to equate the learning of mandarin with the learning of Chinese\nculture\n\n\nUh it there a danger over the years that the mandarin campaign has\nlost its initial objective of replacing dialects instead of replacing English\n\n<$C> \n\nI think our basic aim is still the same uh we try to get\npeople to speak more mandarin instead of dialects\n\n<$D> \n\nThen how do you explain some of the activities during the\ncampaign like encouraging government office to speak uh mandarin to Chinese\nSingaporeans regardless of whether they uh whether they can speak English or\nnot\n\n<$C> \n\nAs the the survey uh reveals we have more and more Chinese\nSingaporeans speaking uh man mandarin in fact even though the Chinese\nSingaporeans may not uh completely speak fluent mandarin but they'll\nunderstand it and uh they can speak some of it but only that uh they may not\nfeel too comfortable in doing so\n\n\nUh again I'm not uh saying that we are trying to replace English\nwith mandarin but if they are already familiar with the language and they\nknow a little bit of it then if they practice more they will speak better\nthat is the idea\n\n<$D> \n\nThe prime minister said last week that the government will\nbegin to pay more attention to the Chinese educated segments of society\n\n\nUhm has this new policy affected the way in which this campaign\nwill be carried perhaps with more intensity\n\n<$C> \n\nI think the budget uh of the campaign is fixed we have people\nuh sponsor activities during the campaign month but all in all we won't be\nable to uh spend too much uh on media because campaign budget is fixed\n\n<$A> \n\nThat was Henry Ng of MITA talking to Adrian Ong about this\nyear's speak mandarin campaign that'll be launched this coming Monday night\n\n\nAmbassador-at-large professor Tommy Koh has said that Singapore\nwill continue to rely on oil and gas until further energy becomes\ncommercially attractive\n\n\nAddressing the seventh Asia-Pacific Petroleum Conference yesterday\nhe gave five suggestions whereby Singapore can use energy more efficiently\nand thus help the environment\n\n\nProfessor Koh who's also chairman of the preparatory committee of\nthe United Nations conference on environment and development told Jane Ong\nwhat his five ideas are\n\n<$E> \n\nFirst I will like to see the ministry of the environment\nworking together with the national council on the environment and the\nconsumers uh uh association to promote green consumerism\n\n\nWhat I mean is to educate the public so that the public will behave\nin a more environmentally responsible way such as switching from ordinary\nlight bulbs to energy-saving bulbs and uh buying fuel efficient cars fuel\nefficient refrigerators air-conditioners\n\n\nUh second I will like to see our architects design buildings which\nare more suited to our climate you know buildings which are not intended for\nair-conditioning should have more shade and cross ventilation\n\n\nThen third I will like to see uh the air-conditioning engineers do\na better job than they do now\n\n\nAt the moment many of our indoor spaces are over-conditioned\n\n\nUh the other thing I want to suggest is that uh the PUB should see\nhow it can increase the thermal efficiency at their power plants which at the\nmoment is about 40 per cent which means that 60 per cent of the heat\ngenerated has been lost\n\n\nFinally I would uh like to commend the government for making\nprovisions in its concept plan for bike way but I want on behalf of the\ncyclists in Singapore to make the point that at the moment our streets are\nunsafe for cycling and I think there is no better way of transport than uh\nthe bicycle because it's a non-polluting uh vehicle\n\n<$F> \n\nHow do you think we can actually put pressure on uhm the\nconcerned for these and parties for example the cyclists' pathways and in\nencouraging people to rely less on air-conditioning\n\n\nHow do you think we can actually move these things on a much faster\npace\n\n<$E> \n\nWell the Ministry of the Environment is intending in fact to\nuh initiate the campaign on green consumerism uh and I think that the\nnon-governmental organisations you know like uh the nature society the\nnational council of the environment uh the ministry education uh our junior\ncolleges or schools I think that and and and an environmentally jour\njournalist you know that was recently uh formed uh a forum of uh\nenvironmental journalists in Singapore I think that these people should come\ntogether to educate the public\n\n\nI I don't think you know it is helpful in Singapore to take a\nconfrontational attitude towards government and if it's unnecessary anyway\nbecause the ministry of the environment is in fact taking the lead in many\nfields you know so I think what we need to do is work together with the\nministry of the environment the ministry education\n\n<$F> \n\nOn an industrial level how do you think environmentalists or\nan environment concerned people in Singapore can work with the oil industry\nfor example which is so important here to ensure that uhm we have a safe a\ngood clean environment\n\n\n\n\nI think that the national council of the environment uh should and\nthe nature's society should have a dialogue with the leaders of our oil\nindustry uh and uh I would myself like to promote such a dialogue\n\n<$F> \n\nAre you happy with what the oil industry has been\n\n<$E> \n\nNow uh I think the leadership of the major oil in uh companies\nwe have are in fact uh very responsive to the environmental concern so I\nwould say yes\n\n<$A> \n\nProfessor Tommy Koh on saving energy and saving the\nenvironment\n\n\nThe French minister of trade for foreign affairs Mr <unclear> word\n</unclear> said that France is committed to the success of talks under the\ngeneral agreement on trade and tariffs\n\n\nAlong with the other members of the European community France has\nhas been accused of snagging the five year <unclear> word </umclear> round of\ngreat Gatt talks\n\n\nThey've been criticised for refusing to cut back on subsidies to\nits farmers\n\n\nWith Gatt talks resuming next month many of its members are not\noptimistic that a conclusion would be reached before the end of the year\n\n\nJane Ong asked Mr who was here for a two-day visit if he holds the\nsame view\n\n<$F> \n\nSo will France's conviction for this uhm talks to be\nsuccessfully concluded will that conviction include even giving in on the\nissue of the farm subsidies which has been described as the stumbling block\nso far\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd that was Mr the French minister of trade for foreign\naffairs who left Singapore for Paris last night\n\n\nAnd coming up next on AM Singapore making a phone call from the air\n\n\nSingapore airlines passenger will no longer have to wait before\nlanding to make a phone call\n\n\nSIA has just launched a new air to ground phone service called\nCetestial that can be used by its long-distance passengers\n\n\nWe join Shangi Barachargi on her first attempt at making the\ncelestial phone call\n\n<$G> \n\nHello I'm Shangi Barachargi I'm calling you from thirty-five\nthousand feet above South China Sea through celestial SIA's new service for\nits passengers able to reach anywhere in the world\n\n\nThe service will be available on all SIA's long-distance flights by\n1994\n\n\nNow sitting next to me is SIA's marketing uh director of marketing\nservices Mr Joseph Chew\n\n\nGood morning Mr Chew\n\n\nNow Mr Chew celestial looks like a rather ordinary cordless\ntelephone but how does the system actually work\n\n<$H> \n\nWell the celestial is the high phone service from SIA and it\nworks quite simply via satellite\n\n\nYou make a call from the cabin <unclear> word </unclear> via the\nsatellite through to the ground telecommunicative system through three\noutstations like <unclear> word </unclear> in the UK <unclear> word\n</unclear> in Norway and Sentosa in Singapore\n\n<$G> \n\nNow this phone call is costing us about 15 Singapore dollars\nfor every minute even this rate's rather steep for the average uhm passenger\n\n<$H> \n\nWell we have looked into this cost but really the element of\ncost uh does not arise because this is a service that we are providing to\npassengers uh and we believe that this is an integral part of service that we\nwant to extend to enhance our service\n\n<$G> \n\nHow many people do you see using this service and who will\nthey be\n\n<$H> \n\nWe do not know exactly how many passengers would like to use\nit but we figure it would be very popular among the business people business\ntravellers and even the family man who's travelling on board \n\n\nNow only a fifteen Singapore dollars is rather steep is there a\npossibility of introducing an off-peak pricing system At the moment we're not\nsure whether there will be an off-peak uh rate uh all we can say is that the\nrate is calculated <unclear> word </unclear> a very nominal basis Now uh I\nunderstand that this is a first of SIA's uhm new services to to developing a\ntotal visit centre for its passengers\n\n\nNow the other thing is back and the date transition centres when\ndo you see this coming on line Well celestial is the first uh first at stage\nnext we believe we will introduce the fax services and real time uh news\nfinancial services and health services probably in two within two years uh it\nseems that we're running out of time at the moment so we have to end the\ninterview there thank you very much mr chew for your company and so with that\nI'm here on sq 888 with Elnor Nair and Chirstina Eng back in the studio and\nthat was with how you could sound like at thirty nine thousand feet in the\nclouds well with that it's time to come down to earth I'm Alna Nair with\nproducer Christian Eng and we'll be back again tomorrow with am Singapore if\nyou happen to be at one of those flights at seven fifteen am why not give us\na call at 3503676 that's 3503676", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL",

{"text": "<$A> \n\nGood evening\n\n\nThe People's Action Party led by Mr Goh Chok Tong who assumed\npremiership just ten years ago was returned to power when nominations closed\nat twelve thirty p.m. today\n\n\nIt's the ninth successive victory for the PAP in the general\nelection\n\n\nOur special report tonight give detail gives details of the\nwalkovers and fights in the constituencies the major statements of party\nleaders at their press conferences and finally an analysis of the issues by\nthree political commentators\n\n\nNo one could have expected the general election so soon in fact the\nopposition calls it the snappiest of snap election but Mr Goh says he wants\nan endorsement now for his style of government and his program\n\n\nHe says he is the issue and the ground is sweet\n\n\nWell who will be contesting who has already won what's the score\nlike at the end of Nomination Day\n\n<$B> \n\nThe PAP has a lot to cheer about its Mr Goh Chok Tong's first\ngeneral election as Prime Minister and he says this is <unclear> word\n</unclear> number of candidates since 1980\n\n\nBy the time the nominations closed at noon today the PAP has fielded\neighty-one candidates and the opposition parties thirty-eight\n\n\nSeven independents will also be vying for a seat in the new\nparliament making a total of one hundred and twenty-six this election\n\n\nOf the five opposition parties in the red this year the Singapore\nDemocratic Party has nine candidates the Workers' Party thirteen the National\nSolidarity Party eight the Singapore Malay National Organisation or PKMS four\nand the Singapore Justice Party four\n\n\nThe total number of opposition candidates this election is\nforty-five down from seventy-five in 1988 and fifty-one in 1984\n\n\nThis turn of events has given the PAP a large number of walkovers\nforty-one\n\n\nIn terms of wards ten out of the fifteen GRCs and one out of the\ntwenty-one single seats have been captured by the ruling party even before\nthe hustling have begun\n\n\nIn other words almost fifty percent of the registered voters do not\nhave to go to the polls\n\n\nAs pre-nomination speculation had predicted the opposition parties\nhave avoided putting up a strong challenge in the GRCs\n\n\nWith the new requirement for four candidates in each GRC one of\nwhom must be a member of a minority group it looks like the opposition has\ndecided they'll have better chances in the single member wards instead\n\n\nTwelve ministers were returned unopposed they include Senior\nMinister Lee Kuan Yew\n\n\nFor the first time he's running with three other candidates in the\nexpanded Tanjong Pagar GRC\n\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Ong Teng Cheong also had a walkover in Toa\nPayoh GRC\n\n<$C> \n\nWe're disappointed I'm sure all our supporters here are\ndisappointed we're all ready for a fight for a contest\n\n<$A> \n\nYes Ang Mo Kio GRC has now gone to the People's Action Party\nand the hundreds of supporters here are just screaming over with excitement\n\n\nBG Lee who picked up one of the highest votes in the last election\nis positively elated\n\n\nI'm going to try to break through the crowd to get a response from\nhim\n\n<$D> \n\nI'm in a midst of uh disappointment\n\n\nWe have hope for contest but election is not over and we're\nfighting all of the seats\n\n<$B> \n\nThe PAP supporters have been going absolutely wild for the\npast few minutes the reason the newly formed Kampong Glam GRC has gone\nuncontested\n\n\nI ask the Minister for Defence Dr Yeo Ning Hong if he was relieved\nhe didn't have to go up against any opposition this time\n\n<$E> \n\nBut a little disappointed the uh supporters are all geared up\nto uh uh fight a good fight ah there won't be any contest\n\n\nThe four constituencies which make up Kampong Glam has uh in 1988\nuh given us better than average uh votes so we are in a sense disappointed\nthat uh we will not be able to uh pull in the extra votes\n\n<$B> \n\nAnother Minister with a walk-over was Environment Minister Dr\nAhmad Mattar who's now returned to Brickworks GRC\n\n<$F> \n\nWell I think we feel happy but at the same time we well\nespecially our our activists feel a little bit disappointed in the sense that\nuh they were all prepared for a contest\n\n<$B> \n\nThe only single-member ward with a walk-over was Kreta Ayer\nthe seat for Finance Minister Dr Richard Hu\n\n\nAmong the new MPs the walk-overs were Kenneth Chen where in 1988\nlost to SDP Chiam See Tong in Potong Pasir\n\n\nHaving captured more than half the eighty-one parliamentary seats\nthe PAP still faces a fight in the remaining forty seats five GRCs and twenty\nsingle-member wards\n\n\nFive ministers will be facing opposition challenges Professor\nJayakumar Lee Yock Suan Mah Bow Tan Seet Ai Mei and the Prime MInister\nhimself\n\n<$A> \n\nPrime Minister Goh Chok Tong arrived at eleven thirty cheered\non heartily by his supporters from Marine Parade GRC\n\n\nExpectations that the opposition would contest Marine Parade GRC\nhave been fulfilled\n\n\nCandidates for the Singapore Justice Party filed in quietly at\neleven forty a.m. <unclear> word </unclear> supporters dominate outside in\nthe car-park cheering and waving banners and there don't seem to be any\nsupporters for the opposition\n\n<$G> \n\nWell there certainly an air of excitement here where a keenly\ncontested fight for Bedok GRC is expected once again\n\n\nThe PAP is being led by a strong team by Professor Jayakumar Dr\nArthur Beng Mr Abdullah Tarmugi and Mr Tan Soo Khoon who has been moved over\nfrom Brickworks for the last from the last fifteen years but the opposition\nis undeterred by this\n\n\nThey have once again decide to fight against the PAP however with\nan entire new team can they do better this time\n\n<$H> \n\nI agree that PAP has put up a very strong team here and I'm\nnot afraid of that and I'm looking forward to the good fight\n\n<$I> \n\nI've just uh seen the names of the candidates uh I don't see\nthat any of them has been active in Bedok or has done anything for the\nresidents in Bedok\n\n\nUh we are looking forward to a fight and we are confident that with\nour team of four my colleagues Arthur Beng uh Tan Soo Khoon and uh Dullah\nTarmugi we will be able to put up a good fight and get the support from the\nvoters\n\n<$B> \n\nAmong the MPs who will be facing contest in their wards are Dr\nTan Cheng Bock in Ayer Rajah who's challenged by Mohamed Aziz Bin Ibrahim\nfrom PKMS\n\n\nIn Bukit Batok Dr Ong Chit Chung will face Kuan Yew Keng from the\nSDP\n\n\nOne closely watched constituency will be Tanglin which for the\nfirst time since 1963 will be contested\n\n\nPAP's Liew Sim Pao will face Jimmy Tan of the SDP and M G Guru an\nindependent\n\n<$J> \n\nWell I'm excited about it and I think my voters are equally\nexcited because on my walkabouts many of them expressed to me the uh their\nwish to cast their vote\n\n\nThey've not excise their right for a long time and I am glad that\nthis opportunity has risen for them to cast their vote and I hope they will\nsupport the PAP government\n\n<$K> \n\nOne of the most keenly contested areas is expected to be\nPotong Pasir where SDP leader Mr Chiam See Tong has been MP since 1984\n\n\nThe mood here is electric SDP's supporters are here and so are the\nPAP who are out in full force to support new candidate Mr Andy Gan\n\n\nBut the question is will Mr Gan be able to reclaim Potong Pasir for\nthe PAP\n\n<$L> \n\nChances are good even though Mr Chiam has been working there\nfor a long time because uh all PAP candidates stand a good chance and\nfurthermore I've worked in the constituency for eight years also and uh\npeople know me and I think they will give me their support\n\n<$M> \n\nThese two who have probably got great positions uh for them in\nthe government have been moved away from Potong Pasir and now they are\nputting a a candidate which they have not announced in uh to have any\npositions so you can decide for yourself what what do you think is my\ncompetitor\n\n<$B> \n\nThis year the opposition is scaling back the size of its\nchallenge to the PAP\n\n\nPart of the reason is that one party the SDP has decided to use the\nstrategy of treating this year's polls as a by-election\n\n\nThey're hoping that by fielding fewer candidates the PAP would be\nable to form the government on Nomination Day\n\n\nThis will make it easier for the opposition to win more seats on\nAugust the thirty-first\n\n\nHowever BG Yeo has this to say\n\n<$N> \n\nI don't quite understand the by-election strategy you know I\nthink they are making a virtue of necessity because they have great\ndifficulty getting candidates\n\n\nI mean to have good candidates you must have people who feel that\nthere are strong rallying causes which make it worth their while to jump into\nthe fray\n\n\nThey've not been able to get very many good people so they decided\nto concentrate their effort and therefore to say that it's a by-election\nstrategy in other words it is making a virtue out of necessity\n\n<$B> \n\nThis year there seems to be a greater measure of co-operation\namong the opposition parties\n\n\nTheir strategy is to pool their candidates together to form GRC\nteams strong enough to challenge the PAP\n\n\nIn Eunos GRC the PAP faces an opposition team which includes the\nformer member of the SDP Mr Mohamed Jufrie Mahmood\n\n\nHe joins NPMP Lee Chiew Choh Wee Han KIm and Maurice Yeo from\nWorkers' Party\n\n\nIt is at this constituency where the PAP won its closest fight in\n1988\n\n\nThis time round they're again fielding Senior Minister of State for\nEducation Dr Tay Eng Soon and he's also joined by his colleagues Sidek Saniff\nand Chew Heng Cheng and Charles Chong\n\n<$O> \n\nOne must not be too too self-confident in this matter you know\nuh I think we still have to work hard to win the elections but uh we've been\nuh talking to various groups of people and uh trying to see whether there are\nany major issues that and unhappiness they have uh\n\n\nSo far they have brought out very few\n\n<$P> \n\nWhat do you think of chance your chances of becoming a full MP\nthis time around\n\n<$Q> \n\nWell we've always been optimistic\n\n<$P> \n\nWhat makes you think that this strategy of moving into\nWorkers' Party will work I mean uh instead\n\n<$R> \n\nWell I cannot tell you for sure that it'll work but I think it\ngives us the best chance and I being in touch and having close close rapport\nwith the leadership of the SDP and the WP I think I should be able to bring\nthese two parties together\n\n<$B> \n\nThe opposition has concentrated its efforts on the\nsingle-member wards for example <unclear> word </unclear> of the Jurong\nJunior College Nomination centre are being contested\n\n<$S> \n\nThese PAP supporters have come out in full force to cheer\ntheir side on and it's this kind of support that the PAP will have to count\non <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nFor the second time running SDP Chairman Mr Ling How Doong will be\nup against Dr Seet Ai Mee\n\n\nDr Seet won by a narrow margin in the 1988 election\n\n<$T> \n\nWhen I met Mr Ling in 1988 I was not completely not known to\nSingapore and uh very and had very little exposure even in the consitu the\nnew constituency of Bukit Gombak\n\n\nIn the last three years I have worked hard to be a good MP to my\nresidents and have tried to develop facilities which the residents needed and\nhave gained great rapport with them so it is uh it will still be a hard fight\nuh but it will be a test of the residents' appreciation uh and whether and\nthat their support for me to carry on the kind of work I've done with them in\nthe last three years\n\n<$U> \n\nI expect those who supported me at the last general election\nin 1988 would support me this time round and then I would expect those who\nsupported Dr Seet they would turn round and support me because of all those\nvery harsh policies of the government \n\n\nAnother closely watched constituency will be Ulu Pandan where the\nPAP has fielded Mr Lim Boon Heng to take over from Dr Dixie Tan Mr Lim faces\nSDP's Ashleigh Seow who in the last election contested Aljunied GRC Of course\nI would uh have to work hard to uh meet them and uh explain to them uh what I\nhave done in Ang Mo Kio and how i can uh translate the ideas which we've\nimplemented in Ang Mo Kio into Ulu Pandan What do you think your chances are\nWell it's always an upward battle against the PAP They are entrenched They\nhave all the assets at their disposal all the means financial and otherwise\nSo it's always an upward battle for the opposition Today the PAP introduced\ntwo candidates Khoo Sai Kee and Harun Abdul Gani Those have walk-overs within\nthe first two hours of being introduced For the PAP the total number of\nfirst-timers is eleven The party usually fields between sixteen and eighteen\nnew faces But as the Prime Minister has said because of the early electionit\ncouldn't meet its usual quota This year's new PAP candidates eight have\nalready walked in without a fight One of them Khoo Sai Kee who's in the\nTanjong Pagar GRC Team together with another new face Lim Hng Kiang commented\non their walk-over We are we are we are MPs and uh we are a little bit\ndisappointed because uh we have no opportunity to uh to work the ground so\nthis means that Hng Kiang and I are virgin MPs uh so which means we've to\nwork even harded to get to know the people New PAP candidate for the\nwalk-over is Ho Peng Kee Sembawang GRC I'm a bit disappointed at not having\nhad the opportunity to go through an election I think that's uh for me as a\nfirst candidate a new candidate something that i would learn a lot As for the\nrest of the new PAP candidates it will be the first time they're campaigning\nfor a seat in parliament On the opposition side there are about twelve\ncandidates fielded for the first time Among them are Ong Teng Kui and Sari\nHasa From now till August the thirty-first eighty-five candidates from the\nsix parties will go on the campaign trail and they'll be appealing to some\neight hundred and fifty thousand voters who'll make their choice known on\npolling day", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nWith nine days to go before the votes are cast the political\nparties are losing no time in stating their campaign platforms\n\n\nJust this afternoon four political parties held press conferences\n\n\nMr Goh Chok Tong defined the issue for the PAP\n\n<$B> \n\nI call this election so I remain the issue in the\nconstituencies to be contested I am con campaigning on the basis that my\nstyle of open consultative government is a right one\n\n\nYou know my program they are pub it's published in the Next Lap\n\n\nMy principal programs within the Next Lap are Edusave Medifund Open\nUniversity Assistance Program to help the bottom ten percent of those living\nin HDB flats\n\n\nWhether we are in government now or not that's the issue in which we\nwill be contesting\n\n\nNow I take on questions from uh the floor\n\n<$C> \n\nYou talk about seeking a clear mandate from the people what do\nyou exactly mean by that\n\n<$B> Well it's a matter of public perception I've been following the papers\nquite a few people thought that uh a clear mandate means I must do better\nthan the last election\n\n\nSome raise some mention figures of sixty-five percent others sixty\npercent so it's a question of how the public perceive this clear mandate to\nbe\n\n\nFor myself I'm looking for an improvement over the last el\nelection's performance\n\n<$D> \n\nHow does the PAP have to return to power\n\n\nGoing by what the opposition has said this is how they see that\nfighting the election as in effect a by-election uh\n\n\nHow would the PAP pass its response to that particular strategy\n\n<$B> \n\nWell whether it's a general election or a by-election how they\nwant to fight it we are fighting on the basis that I'm the issue so you can\ncall it a by-election the fact remains that I am I am still the issue\n\n\nMy judgement is being now put to the test I judge it's a good time\nto call election I judge that my leadership style is right for Singapore at\nthis moment\n\n\nI believe in the program which I've announced so that's the issue\nand it's something which I'm campaigning amongst the electorate to support\n\n\nNow I think we should use the word mandate quite carefully because\nthe PAP is now in government so we've got a mandate to govern\n\n\nThe right term to use is endorsement\n\n\nBefore the election I was looking for a mandate now I'm looking for\nan endorsement\n\n<$E> \n\nWe're looking for a clear signal one which the voters\nthemselves will look at and say yes unambiguously this has expressed our will\n\n<$F> \n\nWhen you say you already have a a mandate a majority now you\nneed you want an endorsement and uh you need something better than last\nelection's performance would that be more than sixty-one point uh percent of\nthe votes\n\n<$B> \n\nWell in the last election we did sixty-three percent of the\nvalid votes cast so I'll be looking for performance in terms of something\nbetter than sixty-three percent but uh you just can't pinpoint the figure\nbecause perception is like love and if you have been loved how deep or how\ndeeply loved are you how do you measure it you see so it's a public\nperception\n\n\nWhether sixty-three is considered a strong endorsement and uh\nnumber of seats won or lost I think there's a combination of factors the\nquality of the results but when you see the results you will know whether it\nis clear or not clear\n\n\nIf you are in love you know whether you are in love or not\n\n<$E> \n\nAnd if you have to measure it you can't be\n\n<$B> \n\nIf you have to measure it yah you can't be in love you pretend\nto be in love\n\n<$F> \n\nIf you do not get the endorsement you're looking for or how\nwill that how will that affect your plans specifically your plans for calling\nby-elections within twelve to eighteen months\n\n<$B> \n\nWell uh first let me clarify you know 'cos some reporters\nthought that my last statement at a dialogue session at Moulmein was a bit of\na threat when I said that if I receive a weak signal I may have to go a\nlittle slow on uh Medisave and Ed Medifund and Edusave\n\n\nNow I believe in the program so even if I get a weak signal I will\nstill campaign with my colleagues with the public to implement the pro in the\nuh the program\n\n\nIt must be I believe in them\n\n<$G> \n\nUhm there was a BBC interview earlier uh last week which said\nthat if you won by a narrow margin there would be a groundswell within the\nparty for BG Lee to take over\n\n\nUh would you like to elaborate on that\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I think the foreign press they would always like to play\none against another which is why I have BG Lee here today to show that uh the\nswell is with me\n\n<$H> \n\nMr Goh I don't mean to be ? ? if the public would be\ninterested worst case scenario if let's say the PAP does lose all remaining\nseats forty seats you say you would consider or should step down\n\n\nIf that's the case if that happens do you have a narrow parent who\nis he and is he ready\n\n<$B> \n\nI have not contemplated such horrors\n\n\nIt must be because my judgement is that this is a good time to call\nfor election and I'm seeking you know a strong endorsement for my program so\nthat thought hasn't crossed my mind at all\n\n<$E> \n\nFurthermore the PAP has not had its steps it's one team and if\nyou will do that it's a rejection of the whole team not of one man\n\n<$I> \n\nCould you explain your approach to spending the reserves uh\nand is it very different from the approach of the old government\n\n<$B> \n\nNow the spare reserves means to use up to consume reserves\nthat's not what we are going to do\n\n\nWhat we have in mind is to use reserves for particular purpose\n\n\nNow we are not going to use ten billion of our reserves we start\noff with one billion for Edusave and thereafter the funds must be accumulated\nfrom economic growth and future surpluses\n\n\nWe didn't want to wait to accumulate the one billion because we\nthought education is a good thing start off immediately\n\n\nNow this is using reserves it's not using up reserves it's not\nspending reserves it's taking out one billion which is under the control of\nFinance Ministry put aside into a dedicated account called Education\nEndowment Fund or Edusave and that account will be managed by the Board of\nTrustees concerned with education\n\n\nThe revenue from that account will be used for the students not the\nprincipals\n\n\nIn other words we're trying to rear two golden geese one called the\nEdusave goose the other one uh Medifund goose and you don't slaughter your\ngolden goose\n\n<$E> \n\nThat's to prevent anybody from cutting their necks some more\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's to prevent others cutting off the necks of the geese\nbut the eggs will be distributed that's what we are doing\n\n<$I> \n\nThis is just a follow-up question uh if you're not using uh\nthe reserves as it were uh why is it important uh for you to to get a clear\nmandate from from from the people\n\n<$B> \n\nWell uh it's not just just a mandate for a change in the way\nof using reserves it's a mandate for the whole program and the program is a\nmajor program it is a very big uh program a major initiative on my part in\naimed primarily at the pocket of population to level up the population\n\n\nOver the last few years our program was aimed primarily at the able\nthe talented in society independent schools gifted program for very able\nchildren income tax uh deductions for the professionals so I'm trying to\nlevel up our society by having this program aimed in at the pocket of\npopulation\n\n\nI want to have an endorsement on the way I think on my philosophy\non the direction I'm taking and that involves using reserves for the two\nfunds but not using up reserves I will repeat that\n\n\nThe Next Lap is not just about uh Edusave or Medifund it's also\nabout the Arts how do we have a more vibrant cultural environment uh for\nSingaporeans to express themselves\n\n\nGeorge has been thinking quite deeply on this issue so maybe you\nmay want to say a few works on this\n\n<$J> \n\nWe want refreshing aspects of Mr Goh Chok Tong's leadership is\nthat he gives us more space to exercise our initiative to do the things which\nwe want to do and therefore to make more creative contributions to the larger\nprocess\n\n\nOne important aspect which we need to overcome is how to increase\nour charm at all levels\n\n\nIt may seem facile it may seem trivial but I would say that the\nability of the government or leaders of Singapore as a whole to be more\ncharming it's very important\n\n\nIt affects our ability to be creative and to create to market and\nto encourage others to make use of our facilities to encourage others to come\nto Singapore to encourage others to settle here\n\n\nSo the arts the creative industries are essential parts of this new\nSingapore that we're talking\n\n\nI mean charm is very important it's not just Edusave it's not just\nMedifund it's not just the SCS because in this world that we are going into\npower is more diffuse soft power is as important as hard power and our\nability to woo to charm to enthuse is very important and Mr Goh's leadership\nin the Next Lap ushers in such a phase for Singapore\n\n<$K> \n\nAre you happy with the majority that this party asks for\n\n\nAre you concerned that it could be perceived as a majority by\npeople because voters in the walk-over constituencies will never get a chance\nto exercise their votes\n\n<$B> \n\nNo personally I would have preferred more seats to be\ncontested because we have so many new candidates and there's nothing like uh\nputting a new candidates through the paces but uh that's over so there's no\npoint talking about uh what it should be or should not be\n\n<$L> \n\nWe will not take we will not take our voters for granted no we\nshould not\n\n\nWe'll work very hard we don't take them for granted we will not\ntake them for granted we'll work very hard to win their votes\n\n<$B> \n\nUh that's correct because if you take your voters for granted\nthen uh they would also tell you that you have taken them for granted in a\nvery painful way right\n\n\nThank you\n\n<$M> \n\nThe Workers' Party on the other hand ask why the elections are\nbeing held so soon\n\n\nIts main spokesman was J.B. Jeyaratnam who's disqualified from\ncontesting this election\n\n<$N> \n\nWhy are they necessary at this particular point of time\n\n\nIs the country facing an economic recession that the government has\nto bring in drastic measures and so they think we'd better go back to the\npeople and explain to them\n\n\nOr is there some na national you know calamity that is staring at\nus in the face and for which the government wants to be prepared and\ntherefore wants the people to back to give them a mandate\n\n\nWe had you know I'm sorry to say just shibboleth from the PAP on\nthe need for this elections\n\n\nAs far as the party is concerned and particularly my concern is to\nbring down the PAP's share of the vote\n\n\nNow come on they're clearly going to be in the government and\nthere's no question of we taking over and I hope that on the first of\nSeptember we will see that the PAP's vote has slumped from sixty to fifty six\nfifty seven\n\n<$M> \n\nMr Jeyaratnam also touched on Medisave and Edusave\n\n<$N> \n\nThose are of course important issues and we will tell the\npeople that these all this Medisave Edusave are not really designed and meant\nto help those who are unable to provide for themselves \n\n\nFor the Singapore Democratic Party Chiam See Tong repeated his\ncall for a strong opposition as the PAP has been returned to government he's\nconfident the SDP's strategy of contesting this election as a by-election can\nwork We believe we have succeeded In fact we have completely succeeded We\ncannot have a better uh pronouncement on Nomination Day What can we expect\nForty contested seats That's the maximum we can have It's beautiful It all\nworks to our advantage at this point of time So up to this point of time we\nare taking the SDP and the opposition are taking the initiative not uh\nPeople's Action Party In the past they've always taken the initiative they've\nintroduced issues and we were all led by the nose and get dragged into\narguments with them on the issue which they have chosen In other words we\nhave gone to contest with them on the grounds and in the circumstances uh in\nwhich they have chosen Of course we get slaughtered we get defeated but now\nit's it's different It's no harm failing but we learn from our failures from\nour lessons So we are taking them on now on our terms not their terms and I\nbelieve the people of Singapore are behind us Well that's how the strategy\nfor some of the parties has been shaping up", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c433429f-f8bd-463d-a325-b4f80ed18494", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.571806+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nCan I have your first question please\n\n<$B> \n\nKube from Wan San news agency\n\n\nMy question is to you Clement de Souza\n\n\nNow in your interview with the SBC radio on election morning you are\nquoted as saying that you wouldn't mind losing one or two single seat\nconstituencies\n\n\nNow four opposition candidates have come in is this because the\nopposition candidates were better qualified than the PAP candidates or is it\na sign that Singaporeans want an opposition in parliament\n\n<$A> \n\nWell I have decided that Singaporeans have uh taken up Mr\nChiam's argument that you need to have opposition in parliament to check the\ngovernment it's also a sign that uh the candidates there are comparable to\nours and the electorate have returned those candidates who in their view\nappear to be good MPs\n\n<$C> \n\nWhether it is indeed so will be seen when these MPs take up\ntheir duties\n\n\nWe are convinced that we have had good candidates and we fielded the\nbest team we could find\n\n\nThe electorate felt that the opposition candidates were plausible\nthat they spoke well and they presented themselves well and decided to give\nthem a try\n\n\nWell we'll see what they can do \n\n\nquestion in Chinese \n\n<$A> \n\nUh I'll try to understand the best I can in English and if I\nmiss out on some points uh either Teng Cheong or Loong can answer you\npossibly in uh Mandarin\n\n\nUh you wanted to know uh what is this work of psychology frankly\nspeaking I find it difficult to understand\n\n\nGood economic growth no difficult issues programmes which have\nbenefited the people not just over the last three years but over the last 26\nyears and that this should be the outcome\n\n\nI also thought that the belief in this open consultative style of\ngovernment and that they were encouraging me and my programme and yet the\npercentage has gone down and we've lost uh 4 seats but for those 4 seats\nwhich we have lost if we going into details perhaps there are local reasons\nit is understandable if there's this mood for wanting to have some plausible\nopposition members of parliament so I can understand why we lost uh Hougang\nBukit Gombak of course Potong Pasir and uh Yishun Central\n\n\nBut uh I cannot understand the results in Eunos there is not a case\nof 4 strong candidates against us we have two ministers of state in Eunos Dr\nTay Eng Soon Sidek Saniff and two very good MPs Charles Chong and Chew Eng\nChee\n\n\nChew Eng Chee has been working on the ground for many years and\nit's Eunos which worries me not Bukit Gombak or Hougang because if I'm sure\nif we look into the reasons in detail we can find an explanation but Eunos as\nof now I just cannot understand and I'm fearful 'cos I cannot understand\n\n\nI've challenged uh Jufrie openly on the use of religion and race to\nwin votes\n\n\nPKam PKMS candidates also invoked religion and they had had a good\nvotes too so I think the signal has been given to many people outside that\nthe use of communal and religious pulls can win you votes\n\n\nThat's what I'm more worried about tonight apprehensive about the\nfuture that the loss of 3 or 4 seats where there could be an explanation\n\n\nNow whether there will be any change of government policy\n\n\nWell I think we would have to review what we want to do\n\n\nUh obviously I would not see moving my programmes so decisively so\nquickly it's not possible I got to try to read the message do they support\nthe programme and I would have to modify the programme if necessary\n\n<$C> \n\nWhether the grassroots are still strong in touch with the\nground\n\n<$A> \n\nOh ah our grassroots are still strong they're in touch with\nthe ground\n\n\nI move around too uh I could sense this time to see that the mood\nwas good people are friendly they wave to me as I drove uh along I I looked\nup the flat and they waved to me\n\n\nMalay Indians Chinese all very friendly and yet this is the result\nso I got to try and understand what they are signaling us\n\n<$D> \n\nTwo questions sir first looking deeper at the election results\ndo you see some signals from the Chinese voters especially the Chinese\neducated\n\n\nLooking at the results in Hougang in Nee Shun in Yishun do you see\nsome signals that they are not happy with some of the government policies\n\n<$A> \n\nI can't come to a conclusion uh now but uh Low Thia Kiang is a\nbilingual candidate speaks good English speaks good Mandarin communicates\neffectively and he's a Teochew\n\n\nHougang has a lot of Teochew I believe that could be a factor\nbecause in his in his rally speeches he used Teochew to reach out to the\npopulation over there\n\n\nTan Guan Seng is also a bilingual in English and Mandarin but he\ncouldn't speak to them in Teochew so that's one obvious factor but there\ncould be other factors that I'll have to look into\n\n\nYes\n\n<$E> \n\nHow would this effect your calling for a by-election\n\n<$A> \n\nWell I've said I would hold by-elections within 12 to 18\nmonths I would still plan a by-elections\n\n\nUh let us have one more and it'll be quite complete\n\n<$F> \n\nUh Mr Goh Eunos factor how much of it could have been due to\nfeeling amongst Malay voters that you've came up too hard against him for\ninstance the use of inshallah and so on in the speeches by Jufrie\n\n<$A> \n\nYou see that's what worries me because if I don't come down\nhard on a candidate using communal line then they would have gone even much\nfurther in this election and because I came down hard that put a stop to it\n\n\nI do not know about this use of inshaallah whether that annoyed the\nMalays or not uh I mean I don't quite understand fully uh the proper\noccasions to use such phrases maybe it's annoyed quite a few people\n\n\nUh Wong Kan Seng's remarks could have perhaps caused some\nmisunderstanding on on on a the use of such religious phrases but could you\nimagine when the crowd is excited after listening to a to a to a rally speech\nand then the use of religious phrases I think that could evoke very strong\ngut feel in the Malays\n\n\nI'm not saying that the use of the phrases is wrong but I'm saying\nthat in the right in the wrong occasion it could lead to more problems\n\n<$C> \n\nSo far as we can tell because we brought this out into the\nopen and took a strong stand against Jufrie the ground move in our favour the\nground meaning both the Chinese voters as well as the Malay voters\n\n\nIf we had not done it I think we would clearly have lost Eunos and\nthe consequences would have been even worse for Singapore\n\n<$A> \n\nI agree with that observation we would have lost Eunos had we\nhad not moved strongly Jufrie's line of politicking\n\n<$G> \n\nCan I say a few words on this\n\n<$A> \n\nYah\n\n<$G> \n\nWhen I commented on Jufrie's use of uh inshallah and halam\ndurillah one reporter asked me whether it's really wrong\n\n\nI said that when used in the right context when used in the right\ncontext it's really the nothing wrong but in a rally when you're appealing to\nthe gut feels the emotional fulls of the Malays and using a rousing speeches\ntalking about religion talking about appealing to the communal feelings\nthat's a very dangerous line to take\n\n\nI did clarify that point \n\n\nquestion in mandarin \n\n<$A> \n\n As I've said in the campaign you cannot have your\ncake and eat it a vote for the opposition is for the opposition is a vote\nagainst my style of government because as I told them in this election I was\nthe issue and I was contesting in every seat\n\n\nI wanted to have this clear mandate from the people for my style of\ngovernment that's very clear we joined issue over there\n\n\nMr Chiam campaigned on the basis that they should return more\nopposition members into parliament I was campaigning on the basis that if you\ndo that you are not giving me support and I did put it to that that you\ncannot have your cake and eat it you got to choose and they've chosen more\nopposition MPs so I have to review what is it that they are signaling me and\nmore important whether my style will win the PAP more votes in future\n\n\nNo matter how popular it is to the people there is such a thing\ncalled bottom line\n\n\nThis style has caused me 4 seats this time will it cause me another\n4 seats in future as I've said both during the campaign and earlier on when I\nmade my introductory remarks personally I'll be very reluctant to change this\nopen consultative style\n\n\nIt's part of me I believe in it I still want to involve people in\ngovernment but to say that I would go back and reflect upon this and modify\nmy style I think would be telling you a lie I certainly would \n\n \n\n\n19 Mar ' 92 FM 90.5 \n\n<$G> \n\nFrom the first games held in 1968 in Chicago USA the special\nOlympics movement has grown to include over eighty countries today\n\n\nStarted by Eunice Kennedy Shraiver on the belief that\nintellectually disabled people can be trained to enjoy and compete in sports\n\n\nThe movement provides year round training and athletics competition\nbut the movement relies entirely on volunteers and private organisations\n\n\nSo does it face a problem with getting enough of either\n\n\nJane Ong has been talking to the chairman of Special Olympics\nInternational Sergeant Shraiver?? \n\n\nSergeant Shraiver \n\n<$H> \n\nSo are you saying that since 1968 when the movement started\nyou've never had any problems with volunteers coaches helpers to help train\nthe these people \n\n\nSergeant Shraiver \n\n<$H> \n\nWhat about the participants themselves\n\n\nYou have no problem with volunteers but with the participants are\nthe people willing to come forward to take part \n\n\nSergeant Shraiver \n\n<$H> \n\nWhat so why do you think that has changed\n\n\nWhy do more uhm men mentally handicap people come forward now to\njoin in the the movement \n\n\nSergeant Shraiver \n\n<$H> \n\nDo you think the Special Olympics uh movement has anything to\ndo with this change about changing perception of what an an intellectually\ndisabled person can do and cannot do \n\n\nSergeant Shraiver \n\n<$G> \n\nWell Singapore has been sending representatives to the games\nsince 1983\n\n\nJane Ong also talked to the president of Special Olympics Singapore\nRobin Chua to find out whether volunteers are as easy to come by as Sergeant\nShraiver said\n\n<$I> \n\nAt the moment uhm have problem with getting the right kind of\nvolunteers volunteers that do has a specific knowledge on a certain sports\n\n\nWe certainly would like to have volunteer in this area\n\n\nVolunteers uh in the other areas like uh administration management\nuhm we do not have any difficulty getting such volunteers\n\n\nSo what we have been uh doing uh at the moment is that uh we have\nencouraged more people from the School of uh Physical Education to come forth\nto help us and we are uhm quite successful in that area\n\n<$H> \n\nWhat about the response from the intellectually disabled uh\nchildren here\n\n\nAre they coming forth to take part in the games\n\n<$I> \n\nYes at the moment the bulk of the training uh is given to\nstudents who are already in our special schools\n\n\nUhm what we are trying to do uh uhm is to reach out to those who\nhave already gone out to work\n\n\nUhm but there are certain constraints like uh getting uh time-off\nfrom uhm employers uh fitting into their training schedule with their their\nwork schedule\n\n\nUh so there are certain constraints in it in that area but we have\nalready lot of few of them who has already gone out for open employment to\ncome back for training and we're able to do that say in on on a Saturday\nafternoons on Sundays \n\n<$H> \n\nSo the response has been good you would say\n\n<$I> \n\nYes definitely uhm it it has caught on\n\n\nUhm we are really encourage by this especially uhm those athletes\nthat has gone to many place\n\n\nWhen they came back we noticed a certain subtle change in them\n\n\nThey're becoming uh social competent they are more friendly they\nmake friends very easily they could make friends to passengers on the plane\nyou know you it's really fantastic\n\n<$G> \n\nRobin Chua on the change in Special at at Olympics\nparticipants\n\n\nWell on that encouraging note we end this morning's AM

to AM Singapore I'm Shanji Dabarachaji\n\n\nThe latest ceasefire the eighth in the Croatian conflict appears to\nbe still holding out and well this may have given the negotiators time for\nboth sides to broker for a more lasting peace that time may be running out\n\n\nAlthough the Yugoslav armed forces have agreed to lift their\nblockade of seven ports in return for an end to a Croatian siege they haven't\nhowever agreed to withdraw from Croatia\n\n\nAlso at six o'clock this morning there were reports of mortar\nclashes in the eastern Croatian towns of <unclear> word </unclear> and\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nGiven such ceasefire violations Peck Siok Lian asks Steven <unclear>\nword </unclear> whether the people who put their names to the agreement\nactually had any control over the forces on the ground \n\n\nSP \n\n<$B> \n\nWell the ceasefire agreement seems to have avoided a major\nissue by not making any mention of the Croatian demand for a total withdrawal\nof federal troops from the republic\n\n\nDoes this mean that there will be uh negotiations leading to a\nre-drawing of the internal boundaries of Yugoslavia \n\n\nSP \n\n<$B> \n\nBut uh by not going along with the Croatians don't you feel\nthat uh the Serbians are in fact adamant on making uh herself the dominant\nrepublic in Yugoslavia and therefore uhm working towards what has been called\nthe greater Serbian nation \n\n\nSP \n\n<$A> \n\nAnd that was Steven Pavlovich from the University of\nSouthampton\n\n\nSocialism or death\n\n\nWell that rather ominous question was Fidel Castro's defence of\ncommunism\n\n\nBut when a country hold its fourth party congress later today the\nquestion is one of survival the survival of a dying breed of orthodox\nsocialism and the survival of a Castro regime\n\n\nWhen the two thousand or so delegates meet today their main task is\nto draw up a blueprint for the island socialist system rather than dish out\nmagical remedies for the crumbling Cuban economy\n\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> is Chief of a Hispanic division at the US\nLibrary of Congress in Washington D.C.\n\n\nProducer Tan Yong Meng asked him how the recent announcement of\npossible cut in Soviet aid to Cuba could affect its economy as well as the\ncongress proceedings \n\n\nCB \n\n<$C> \n\nSo in the light of this how closely do you think the Cubans\nwill be watching for changes in the party congress that's starting later\ntoday \n\n\nCB \n\n<$C> \n\nDo you expect Fidel Castro to institute any kind of reforms if\nuh to just satisfy these uh expectations \n\n\nCB \n\n<$C> \n\nBut is there a serious challenge at this moment to his\nleadership do you think \n\n\nCB \n\n<$C> \n\nSo given the rather severe economic conditions at the moment\nhow long do you think that Fidel Castro can hold off public discontent \n\n\nCB \n\n<$A> \n\nCol Blazier on the future of Fidel Castro's socialist Cuba\n\n\nIn a moment spending too much time in front of the television we\nfind out why Malay parents may approve\n\n\nIn November last year teleview launched the first supplementary\nmaterial and revision tutorials better known as SMART and the aim to provide\ncomprehensive syllabus of revision materials for primary school students\n\n\nThe first SMART lessons were in English Mathematics and Science\n\n\nThen about six weeks ago the Chinese SMART lessons were launched\n\n\nYesterday the Malay SMART program was introduced this has paved the\nway for the implementation of SMART lessons using teleview's new interactive\nlearning system or I uh or ILS\n\n\nThe Malay SMART will be the first to use the system\n\n\nMrs Goh Kwan Kwan teleview's resident product manager explains to\n<unclear> word </unclear> just how interactive the system can be in teaching\nlanguages\n\n<$D> \n\nThese systems allowed some the computer to mark the answers\nkeyed in by the students and it will keep the scores\n\n\nThat means immediately after you finish the lesson it will tell you\nwhether the answer is correct or wrong\n\n\nIf it is correct they'll be given one mark for the questions and at\nthe <unclear> word </unclear> at the end of the lesson they will give you a\ntotal score and give you the ranking\n\n<$E> \n\nAre you say that the students can be ranked using this system\n\n\nHow are they ranked with whom\n\n<$D> \n\nWith all those who have locked in the teleview who have tried\nthe particular lessons all those people who sign in the system know who you\nare okay\n\n\nSo they will know uh this is your first attempt of this the\nquestions or this is the second attempt of this of the of the set of\nquestions\n\n\nSo let's say you score ten out of twenty very likely your score\nwill be in the fifteenth fiftieth position it'll provide some uh motivation\nfor some of the students maybe not all that want to be always on the top and\nuh at the same time it provide convenience that means you can stop anytime at\ntheir own pace\n\n\nSo let's say if you uh this lesson have ten questions okay you have\nfinished until six question and you have to you know have to stop for some\nreason and the next time you come back it he knows that you stop at the tenth\nlesson and he will give you the eleventh lessons for you to continue to\ncomplete the lessons\n\n<$E> \n\nCan the system tell him where he's gone wrong\n\n<$D> \n\nSo far the Malay lessons that we have uh uh prepared uh didn't\nshow that because uh the teacher think that it's not necessary at this point\nin time because it's a little bit simple\n\n\nMaybe for the future lessons we will uhm have another uh page to\nshow them uh if you're wrong why you are wrong and what is the corrections uh\n\n<$E> \n\nIn a classroom situation when the student finds it very\ndifficult to learn a language in what ways can this interactive system\nencourage him to learn a language\n\n<$D> \n\nThe teachers that uh write this particular lesson uh they are\nexperts in this area okay and they know they know how to use interactive uh\ncolourful graphics uh sometime even crossword puzzle to attract them\n\n\nUh we also give bonus to the student who complete the lessons\n\n<$E> \n\nNow in language learning pronunciation is very important how\ndoes the system help a student pronounce the words properly\n\n<$D> \n\nWe have another package on teleview that has voice respond\nvoice output in fact it is the digitized <unclear> word </unclear> human\nvoice\n\n\nAll the teleview user can download this program and get a voice\ncard and they can have a voice output and it will be very effective for\nlearning uh language spoken language\n\n<$A> \n\nMrs Goh Kwan Kwan teleview's resident product manager and from\nacquiring a language to learning love acceptance and responsibility\n\n\nFind out how pre-schoolers here are gaining these values next on AM\nSingapore \n\n\nTC \n\n<$A> \n\nThat was Tan Chuen a four year boy with cerebral pulsy singing\na song he had just learned in school\n\n\nTan Chuen is one of the six disabled children who have been\nintegrated into regular preschools with the help of assisted integration\nsupporter or <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nThe two year uh the two year pilot project is set up by the\nSingapore Counselor of Social Services\n\n\nIt hopes to study the feasibility of integrating physically\ndisabled children between the ages of two and five into existing pre-schools\n\n\nAt present <unclear> word </unclear> is providing consultative and\ntherapeutic support <unclear> word </unclear> preschools\n\n\nIt hopes to however to involve more centres and to have a total of\nforty disabled students in regular pre-schools by the end of two years\n\n\nKaren Won ask Judy Hills the project director whether such a\nsetting was the most conducive environment for a disabled child \n\n\nJH \n\n<$F> \n\nBut in a regular pre-school teachers are not trained in\nworking with the special needs children so uhm will this actually hamper the\nhandicapped child's learning process \n\n\nJH \n\n<$F> \n\nWill the lessons uh have to be adapted with the presence of uh\nhandicapped child in the school \n\n\nJH \n\n<$F> \n\nBut the teachers will have to pay more attention to this uh\nspecial needs child so will the other children uh actually get less of a\nteaching time \n\n\nJH \n\n<$F> \n\nCan you be sure that when the child moves out of this\npreschool there will be actually uh kindergarten or even a primary school who\nmight be willing to take the child on \n\n\nJH \n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> is a teacher in one of the\npre-schools under <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nAccording to her bringing the two groups of children together has\nhad a positive effect on the behaviour of the pre-schoolers\n\n<$G> \n\nAh the rest of the kids at first they are very uhm they more\nthey tend to fight more and with Wan Yi around they tend to help and I see\ntheir other side of them you know the good side all that instead of just the\nnaughty side\n\n\nThey are very nice they play with Wan Yi very well and I saw that\nthey are they can talk to her and they play with her very well and they help\nher whenever like if she fell down they help to pick her up and if let's say\nshe cannot colour very well they try to tell Wan Yi that you're supposed to\ncolour this way you're supposed to paint this way they help her they become\nvery helpful and they're very responsible kids now\n\n<$H> \n\nHe's more vocal he's able to relate stories to me what he has\ndone and uh he's uh more independent in terms of social behaviour he does\nthings on his own\n\n\nUhm prior to that when he was uh at the uh uh special school he was\nnot that responsive responsive I've to do things for him\n\n\nI guess the children there they don't talk very much and uh uhm so\nright now when he's uh in this school he plays with the kids the kids they\ntalk to him and he picks up words from them\n\n\nUhm and I guess the uh the kids benefit too in terms uh you know\nwhen they interact with handicapped child with the children like Tan Zhen\nthey are more caring helpful and uh I guess the it it remove the stigma that\npeople have uh you know uh uh towards handicapped to towards the handicapped\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd that was Mrs Shuen Tan talking about the benefit of\nintegration for her physically disabled son\n\n\nThat report was compiled by Karen Won and on that young note we\nhave to the end of today's edition of AM Singapore\n\n\nJoin me Shanji Dabarachargi with with producer

told that I actually faced a lot of home\nground pressure uhm bowling in Singapore and I guess the big pool of talent\nout there uh adds on more pressure and it also probably stemmed from the fact\nthat I won my first tournament in nineteen eighty four six months into the\nsport\n\n<$I> \n\nUhm was there any particular reason why you were doing so much\nbetter in the international titles than in the national games\n\n<$J> \n\nI guess uhm psychologically I was better prepared and being a\nlocal tournament uhm I I have not prepared myself well enough over the years\nand having four years of experience behind me and international exposure\nthere's no reason for me not to do well any more locally\n\n<$I> \n\nBut uh uhm what are your plans now\n\n<$J> \n\nWell I'm looking forward to the Asian FIQ which which would be\nheld in August in in Perth and also the major uhm big event South East Asian\nGames next year and Singapore will be hosting the SEA Games next year and\nI'll be going for my third masters title so hopefully I will be prepared then 'cos\nI have a whole year to do that \n\n<$I> \n\nGood luck\n\n<$J> \n\nThank you", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nOn AM Singapore this morning what Australia looks for in\nPresident Bush's visit Singapore Australia tie up with an arts and food\nbusiness during the holidays\n\n\nHello I'm Zainal Abidin\n\n\nPresident George Bush arrives in Australia today the first stop of\nhis twelve day trip to the Asia Pacific countries which includes Singapore\nSouth Korea and finally Japan\n\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> was the mission he meant to be a good move\nvisit is now said to be more of a trade mission with creations of jobs for\nAmericans at home as his primary target\n\n\nTo the countries he's visiting he carries the firm message that free\ntrade is a two way street\n\n\nBy this he hopes to gain greater access for US goods and services\ninto booming Asia Pacific economists\n\n\nThe message is primarily aimed at the Japanese with whom US has a\ntrade deficit of forty billion US dollars and seventy five percent of which\nis attributed to the high export of Japanese cars into the United States\nwithout reciprocal openness by the Japanese automobile market\n\n\nBut during his talk in Australia the top issue on the agenda is\nlikely to be America's defence commitment in the region\n\n\nBut is this the only concern of the Australians\n\n\nWith some insight into the Australian's view of the matter I'm\njoined on the line now by political correspondent in Australia Mike <unclear>\nword </unclear>\n\n\nGood morning Mike\n\n<$A> \n\nYes uhm so will regional defence or regional security be\nAustralia's key concern uh during Bush's visit there\n\n<$A> \n\nNo what are the specific trade issues that will be raised by\nAustralia\n\n<$A> \n\nSo what do Australians generally feel about Bush's call for a\nfree trade and greater access for US goods in the Asia Pacific market\n\n<$A> \n\nNow something has has it that US agricultural surplus with\nAustralia goods into a very high figure of about about one billion dollars\nactually but will be Australia's request on on this matter to the US for this\n\n<$A> \n\nNow you know since the whole matter concerns the farmers do\nyou expect the farmers to go on a demonstration to show their displeasure of\nuh US agricultural subsidies policy\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uh now with a with reference to the defence uh commitment\nof the US in the region what do you think uh would be Australia's uh\nparticular expectations of Bush's trip\n\n<$A> \n\nWell thank you Mike for joining us this morning\n\n\nPolitical correspondent Mike <unclear> word </unclear> of Melbourne\n<unclear> word </unclear> on the line from Canberra\n\n\nA corporation of the artistic kind between Singapore and Nanyang Ac\nAcademy of Fine Arts with an Australian university will give art enthusiasts\nthe opportunity to get their fine arts degree locally\n\n\nIn the past getting a degree in the fine arts often meant studying\nin a foreign country\n\n\nThis prospect will now change\n\n\nStudents can now pursue a degree course at the Nanyang Academy of\nFine Arts under a joint campus arrangement with Curtin University in\nAustralia\n\n\nStarting July nineteen ninety two the academy will be adding\nanother year to its normal three-year diploma course\n\n\nStudents taking this additional year will be eligible for a degree\nawarded by Curtin University\n\n\nBut what's the advantage of having a paper qualification in a field\nsuch as the fine arts where it's the work that counts a question Shanji\nDabaracharji put the academy's President Dr Gwee Ee Hian\n\n<$B> \n\nThe work of course comes in most importantly in fact it's also\nbased on the work that they will be awarded degrees\n\n\nAlso when an employer employs an artist he will look at the work\nrather than at the paper you have so you are quite right in that regard\n\n\nBut on the other hand uh there is a tendency in Singapore as\nelsewhere for people who have completed tertiary education to receive that\ndegree as a sort of a benchmark of their uh educational uh uh progress you\nknow\n\n\nSo I think there's no reason why people in art and in design you\nsee should be deprived of that opportunity and be on par with others who\nstudy the traditional disciplines\n\n\nI think the satisfaction to the people who are in this area is also\nvery important\n\n<$C> \n\nSo it's basically a self-satisfaction in getting a degree uhm\nthat's the main purpose of going for this uhm this course offered by Curtin\n\n<$B> \n\nI think it's more than that\n\n\nIt's also recognition that your work you see has also reached a\nstandard which is on par with other university studies\n\n<$C> \n\nWell you talk about standards uh I understand that Curtin\nuniversity will be determining the academic syllabus for this course but how\nwill the local Asian flavour be retained in this course because you seeing\nhow Curtin is an Australian university\n\n<$B> \n\nOh the uh development of the curriculum for this fourth year\nwill be done in fact jointly\n\n\nThe uh students will be taught by us and therefore the Asian\nflavour would still be retained and for the theoretical studies I think a\nlittle bit of uh Australia input you see in fact would be very very useful\nbut the bulk of the teaching being done in Singapore by our own staff and the\nenvironment is such we are pretty sure you see that the fourth year as far as\nthe style as the content go you see will be a continuation of the first three\nyears where the students were trained by us\n\n<$C> \n\nSo there will be some retention of the local Asian flavour\neven if they even if the degree is conferred by Curtin university\n\n<$B> \n\nUh I think it will be more than retention\n\n\nThe local flavour will be there in fact that's one aspect where\nCurtin is very interested\n\n\nThey also want to see that uh our work here would also have some\ninfluence on their home students in Australia later on\n\n\nIt's a two-way exchange\n\n<$C> \n\nIt's a two way exchange so what exactly will our students be\nlearning from Curtin university\n\n\nIf it is uh will it be basically style technique\n\n<$B> \n\nUh style technique yes but I think they would also inject a\nstronger element of theoretical studies than what uh we have been accustomed\nto\n\n<$C> \n\nCould you get elaborated than that\n\n<$B> \n\nI think uh the training in NAFA had been studio-based so uh\nthe Australians would probably come in and provide uh academic studies like\npsychology of art history of art aesthetics and so on and also they will\nbring in some Australian influence and background which will interact with\nour Nanyang influence to create something that is even more interesting than\nyou know what we have been doing on our own\n\n<$A> \n\nDr Gwee Ee Hian uh Principal of the Nanyang Academy of Fine\nArts\n\n\nYou've just tuned in you're listening to AM Singapore and coming up\nnext how the food business is faring during this festive season\n\n\nFancy dining on the top of the world feasting on juicy lobsters\ndelicate ascagoes and popping champagne to welcome in the nineteen ninety two\nat midnight tonight\n\n\nWell sounds infinitely tempting doesn't it\n\n\nWell if you're willing to splurge a whopping a hundred and eighty\neight dollars on fine wine and exquisite cuisines then treat yourself\n\n\nBut for most other Singaporeans the traditional New Year's Eve\ndinner tonight may be a less elaborate affair but an affair nonetheless\n\n\nSingaporeans may not have shopped as much this Christmas on New\nYear's season because of expected economic slowdown as recent reports suggest\nbut the feasting and partying seems as feverish as ever\n\n\nIn fact when Tan Yong Meng made a check with three major local\nhotels all reported an increase in sales volume in their food and beverage\noutlets <unclear> word </unclear> executive assistant food and beverage\nmanager of Hyatt <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nEric Golding manager of Goodwood Park said the hotel also\nregistered an increase in business this Christmas\n\n\nDaniel Chia director of operation at SMI hospitality services which\nmanages the Pinacle attributes the better sales this year to more sensitive\npricing strategies\n\n<$D> \n\nWell compared to last year surprisingly there has been an\nimprovement of about five percent\n\n\nUh I said surprisingly because uh when I took a walk around around\nthe uhm shopping centres there appeared to be uh a lack of uh activity\ncompared to past years festive season\n\n\nIt is our new pricing strategy that has uh enabled us uh to reach\nout uh much more patrons\n\n\nSince October we have a pricing package which allows the patrons to\nchoose three four or five courses uh on a run of the menu basis at uh a\nminimum of sixty two dollars plus plus\n\n\nI believe that this is the uh main factor which uh motivated people\nto come to the Pinacle\n\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> of Hyatt\n\n\nOne of the hotels' main strategies in filling restaurant seats is\ndirect selling to an identified segment of the market\n\n\nOne food chain that did experience a slowdown in business this\nfestive season is the Tung Loke group of restaurants its managing director\nAndrew Chew\n\n<$E> \n\nIt is satisfactory in general but uh we do experience a drop\nin sales in uh some of our restaurants but this ah could be due to uh more\nrainy days this month than uncertainty about the future of the economy\n\n<$A> \n\nAndrew Chew expects harder times ahead especially when\nSingaporeans tightens their belt in economic slowdown\n\n\nTo make things worse he expects keener competition from new\nrestaurants expect to to open next year\n\n\nEating is a national hobby but most Singaporeans eat out less\nespecially when one needs to dig deep into one's pocket in leaner times\n\n\nThe three hotels that Tan Yong Meng talked to weren't too concerned\nabout the prospects of a slowdown\n\n\nSo the heartier your <unclear> word </unclear> appetite is next\nyear the more mouth mouth-watering the takings will be for hotels and\nrestaurants\n\n\nIn the meantime if you're planning on dining out at some pricy\njoints tonight it's fine wine glorious food and wise company to usher in the\nnew year bonapetit and a very happy and profitable new year\n\n\nAnd on that festive note we end this morning's edition of AM\nSingapore\n\n\nWe'll be back again tomorrow morning to bring you more stories\nbehind the headlines on New Year's Day\n\n\nUntil tomorrow then on behalf of producer Tan Yong Meng this is\nZainal Abidin wishing you a relaxing holiday \n\n  Moneymind 28 June ' 93 \n\n<$F> \n\nChristopher good evening\n\n<$G> \n\nGood evening David\n\n<$F> \n\nWelcome to Moneymind\n\n\nWell we've seen the market already take a fall and comeback\nintraday we've seen it stop at seventeen twenty-one\n\n\nIs this the correction and do you still think that we could test\nseventeen hundred\n\n<$G> \n\nUhm it is part of the correction but I still think we can test\nseventeen hundred uh though of course uhm since realism has been built into\nthe market uhm a lot of the bad news if you like is now being discounted in\nthe market\n\n\nYou see you must understand David that much of what has been\nattributed to us uhm I think hasn't been probably over exaggerated\n\n\nThe main argument that we have been putting is that the market\nmoves on perception and many people had been concerned about overheating in\nChina so Hong Kong has they've been taking money out of uh they have seen the\nMalaysian second and third liners go through the roof so they're weary there\nand well basically most <unclear> word </unclear> investors have been losing\nmoney in Thailand so they know there've been a problem in the Bangkok market\n\n\nBut they see Singapore as being terribly safe and and I think\nthat's the principle concern\n\n<$F> \n\nOkay when you made this prediction you looked at certain\nindicators\n\n\nWould you like to take us through some of this\n\n<$G> \n\nYes I'll like to take you two very si simple ones\n\n\nThe first one is our leading indicator for the economy\n\n\nAs you can see there on the yellow line uhm the economic indicator\nis suggesting as least one if not two quarters of week GDP growth\n\n\nNow I'm not saying that there's going to be a fall out but the\npoint is that many international and local investors had assumed no uh uhm\nhiccups in GDP growth and consequently you know this small problem\n\n\nThe second is the timing problem \n\n\nWe are expecting the market to improve very dramatically but as\nshown in this second chart which has earnings versus the market\n\n\nNow the yellow line is the market changes and the red line is the\nearnings change\n\n\nAs you can see there is actually a very strong correlation between\nthe two\n\n\nTheory suggests that the market does anticipate changes in\nearnings as we can see in 1981 and 82\n\n\nNow in 1983 and 84 the market over-anticipated and was pulled down\n\n\nIf we go to 1992 and look at that the market is anticipating a\nrise", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nThis is AM Singapore with the stories behind this news\n\n\nSingapore gets a precinct of five museums and France of his masters\nin business and engineering\n\n\nGood morning I'm Peck Siok Lian\n\n\nA National Heritage Board will be set up next year to manage a\nprecinct of five museums stretching from the old Saint Joseph Institute to\nFort Canning\n\n\nThe five centres include the Singapore History Museum and a Fine Art\nMuseum to be set up at the old SJI and an ancient civilizi civilization\nmuseum people's and children museum to be housed in the former Tao Nan school\n\n\nExpected to take twenty years to develop the plans for the museum\nprecinct was announced yesterday by the Minister for Information and the Arts\nBrigadier-General George Yeo\n\n\nOpening an ex exhibition on gems of Chinese art at Empress Place the\nminister spoke on the government's attitude towards museums\n\n<$B> \n\nWe have not actively promoted the National Museum in the past\nbecause museums were not high on our scale of national priorities\n\n\nWe were more concerned with more basic issues more basic\nrequirements in the past\n\n\nFor many years the museum lacks space and expertise and because we\ndid not seem to welcome donations enthusiastically a few Singapore collectors\nchose to give to other countries instead\n\n\nThis was a great loss to Singapore and I hope this will now change\n\n\nWe are now embarked on a program to create more display space and\nto systematically build up our museum expertise and in the next lap of our\nnational development we must give much more attention to culture and the arts\n\n<$A> \n\nWhile calling on individuals and corporations to make\ndonations the minister also challenged museum managers to persuade these\nprivate collectors and organisations to come forward\n\n<$B> \n\nThe modest annual budget the National Museum has for\nacquisitions is hardly enough\n\n\nWe'll therefore have to rely heavily on loans and on donations\n\n\nLoans can be by private individuals like the <unclear> word\n</unclear> exhibition which we're opening today\n\n\nAll by foreign governments like the Tang Dynasty exhibition which\nis now going on at Empress Place\n\n\nWe must also encourage more individuals and corporations to make\ndonations\n\n\nWe have received valuable donations in the past but we need much\nmore\n\n\nWe need to encourage both Singaporeans and non-Singaporeans\n\n<$A> \n\nThe minister envisioned the museum precinct to be a lively\npart of the civic district\n\n\nHe outlined the challenges ahead in achieving this\n\n<$B> \n\nIn addition to good curators we need good entrepreneurs who\nunderstand what will draw in the crowds\n\n\nWe need a whole area of facilities for the young and old for local\nresidents and for visitors for the serious and the not-so-serious\n\n\nWe need good restaurants we need good museum shops and in this way\nwe will be better able to recover a part of our operating costs and to make\nthe whole atmosphere a more lively one\n\n<$A> \n\nThe Minister for Information and the Arts Brigadier-General\nGeorge Yeo\n\n\nWith the challenges spelt out for them what action are our local\nmuseum managers likely to take\n\n\nShirley Loo-Lim is deputy Director of the National Museum\n\n\nShe told Shanji Dabaracharji that although it's possible to recover\npart of the museum's operating costs they'll never be self-sufficient\n\n<$C> \n\nThe revenue generated will never never be sufficient to\nsupport uh all these museums\n\n\nUh earlier on we were saying that all museums in the world are\ndependent on their respective governments for funding for support\n\n\nThere isn't a museum in the world that is totally self-sufficient\n\n\nPerhaps there is one in Switzerland I believe and that is the\nTransport Museum uh but then that museum is totally supported by a very very\nwealthy individual whose passion is to uh have a a communications museum so\nthat's a separate issue alright but other national museums around the world\nare very dependent on the state for funding support\n\n<$D> \n\nSo you don't anticipate our museums National Museum and the\nEmpress Place museum to become commercially viable independent of government\nsupport\n\n<$C> \n\nIt will continue to be dependent for government support\nbecause I would say about seventy percent of the expenditure would go towards\ncollections' care\n\n\nWe have to conserve and preserve the collections\n\n\nWe have to maintain\n\n\nWe have to have the right environmental standards and controls so\nthese are expensive\n\n<$D> \n\nNow the minister has also set down the challenge to the\nmuseums in terms of its expertise\n\n\nHe's mentioned that the curatorial expertise should be improved and\nthat we should have some entrepreneurial skills also you see coming into the\nmuseums\n\n<$C> \n\nCorrect correct yes\n\n<$D> \n\nHow do you\n\n<$C> \n\nEntrepreneurial in the sense of uh uh going into some business\nactivities for example uh we plan to start museum shops museum gift shops\n\n\nIf you were to visit other museums in Europe and in the United\nStates invariably there is the museum gift shop you know and the purpose of\nthis museum gift shop is to retail heritage-based products\n\n\nIn other words out of the collections that the museum has we will\nmanufacture things based on our collections for sale not only on the retail\nbasis but also on the wholesale basis we hope we hope\n\n<$D> \n\nWell at the moment National Museum does not follow up on this\ntrend\n\n\nUh when do you see this actually coming about\n\n<$C> \n\nWell we are in fact renovating a corner shop at at Armenian\nStreet\n\n\nCan I leave some surprises up my sleeves because if I tell you\neverything that we are going to manufacture it might affect our competitive\nedge you know\n\n<$D> \n\nAnother another challenge thrown open by the minister was in\nthe sourcing of donations from individuals and corporations\n\n\nHow do hope to go about uh achieving this\n\n<$C> \n\nWe hope to set up an endowment fund\n\n\nUh when we say donations by corporations and by individuals we\ndon't confine just to to cash donations we are thinking in terms of uh\nprivate collectors who have their own private collections of treasures\nwhether they are ceramics bronzes paintings whether Chinese paintings\ncontemporary art uh artifacts that private collectors themselves treasure and\nthey may want to share their own collections with other Singaporeans and our\nforeign visitors by lending or donating to the National Museum for display\n\n<$D> \n\nThis is obviously going to be a challenge for for yourself and\nthe Empress Place Museum uh managers because private collectors are reluctant\nto still to share their pieces with the public\n\n<$C> \n\nI own out\n\n\nYou'll have to leave that to us to our discretion alright something\nthat it's best uh not to talk about in public\n\n<$A> \n\nShirley Loo-Lim Deputy Director of the National Museum holding\nher cards <unclear> word </unclear> her chest there\n\n\nThe time now is seven twenty two\n\n\nNext looking abroad to the latest in the Middle East\n\n\nIt's been threatened used as a bargaining chip and nearly caused\nthe end of a long and sweet friendship but the issue of the American loan\nguarantees to Israel appears to have been finally settled as both countries\nreached a compromise yesterday\n\n\nIn return for the US two billion loan to resettle Jewish immigrants\nin the occupied territories Israel will <unclear> word </unclear> the\nconstruction of new settlements but this is only until those already under\nconstruction are completed\n\n\nSo how significant a compromise is this on the part of Israel\n\n\nEarlier this morning Dr <unclear> word </unclear> from the Televiv\nUniversity in Israel gave me his assessment\n\n<$A> \n\nWell given this reality will the Palestinians talk peace with\nIsrael in the next round of talks then if Israel will continue building in\nthe occupied territories anyway\n\n<$A> \n\nBut how will this compromise affect both Shamir and Sharon in\nthe next elections given that Sharon his hardline housing minister vows never\nto stop Israeli settlements\n\n<$A> \n\nDr <unclear> word </unclear> from the Televiv University\n\n\nIf you have a Bachelor's degree and looking to get a masters one\ncountry you might want to go to is France\n\n\nLocal graduates with a basic degree can enter the second year of\nFrench <unclear> word </unclear> <unclear> word </unclear> or prestigious\nuniversities and get their masters in two years\n\n\nThis is just one of the many educational packages offered by\nrepresentatives of French universities and graduate schools\n\n\nThey're here for a three-day seminar that's jointly organised by\nthe French embassy and the Ministry of Education\n\n\nAlthough a wide spectrum of different disciplines was introduced\nemphasis was given however given to engineering and business management\nstudies\n\n\nKaren Won met up with the Director of research <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n\nHe told her that France is no longer a place where one only goes to\nstudy arts and design\n\n<$E> \n\nWhen a student go over to France to do a degree perhaps in\nbusiness or even in engineering how marketable are their degrees\n\n<$E> \n\nRight could you describe in a very practical uhm way what the\ndifferences between the French education in terms of like you mentioned\nengineering and the American university\n\n<$E> \n\nA common concern most locals have about studying in France is\nthe need to master the language\n\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> Director of the Centre for Applied\nLanguages doesn't think it'll be an obstacle\n\n<$E> \n\nYa when you talk about perhaps uhm courses like uh designs or\nart language may not play such an important part but now you're promoting\nbusiness and engineering courses\n\n<$E> \n\nUhm in such courses language may play a very important part so\nwill foreign students without a strong mastery in the French language be at a\ndisadvantage\n\n<$E> \n\nAre there any preparatory courses or some supports um given to\nforeign students who may not know the French language very well\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> on the learning of French\n\n\nIf you want to know more about studying in France you can visit the\nseminar at the RELC or call the French embassy\n\n\nThe number is 4664866\n\n\nThat's all for AM

Ahrad\n\n\nIs it fair to say now that his fate is now sealed \n\n\nJC \n\n<$B> \n\nBut is it only Israel which is likely to be responsible for\nthe death of Sheikh Habas or will the US also be blamed because of their\ncontinued support for Israel \n\n\nJC \n\n<$B> \n\nSo you don't think that American installations could also be\ntargets for possible retaliation \n\n\nJC \n\n<$B> \n\nBut to what extent is the Hisbollah free to retaliate on its\nown as opposed to getting its go-ahead and direction from Tehran \n\n\nJC \n\n<$B> \n\nBut Iran has clearly been trying to improve its international\nstanding over the past couple of years so do you think that President\nRafsanjani do you think he'll be now in a dilemma in that he has to show\nsupport for Hisbollah and yet not do so at the expense of angering the West\ntoo much \n\n\nJC \n\n<$B> \n\nBut do you think that Iran will only give the impression of\nsupporting their Muslim constituencies since it was not much appreciated by\nthe West during the Gulf War as well as when they stuck out their necks in\nworking for the release of Western hostages \n\n\nJC \n\n<$A> \n\nSo how will Israel respond in the likelihood of an Hisbollah\nattack but first how did this whole vendetta start\n\n\nBut why did the Israelis do what they did at the expense of the\npeace talks and what fate will that ultimately spell for the Middle East\npeace process\n\n\nDaud Kutap a journalist from the Middle East International talked\nto Peck Siok Lian from Jerusalem\n\n<$B> \n\nBut apart from the pride of the military being hurt do you\nthink that the attack was a deliberate Israeli attempt to scuff the peace\nprocess \n\n\nDK \n\n<$B> \n\nSo you think the peace process can survive despite this\nobvious upset \n\n\nDK \n\n<$B> \n\nThe Israelis have warned that the army is also to strike back\nharshly should Hisbollah retaliate\n\n\nNow how how fast and where are they likely to first strike back \n\n\nDK \n\n<$A> \n\nAnd that was Daud Kutap of the Middel East International\n\n\nYou've been listening to AM Singapore\n\n\nIt's now twenty five minutes past seven\n\n\nVietnam's efforts to move foreign capital and technology into the\ncountry has paid off handsomely so far\n\n\nSince nineteen eighty eight there's been a three-fold increase in\nthe volume of foreign investments\n\n\nBy the end of last year more than three hundred projects were in\nexcess of US two point five billion dollars have poured in\n\n\nNow one of the factors that's led to this inflow is its liberal\nforeign investment flaw which was amended in nineteen ninety\n\n\nIt allows for private companies to establish bus business ventures\nwith foreign investors\n\n\nOf the thirty four countries putting their investment dollar there\nTaiwan Hong Kong Australia and France are the main contributors and more\nAsian and Western countries are rushing in to get a piece of the action\ndespite a US economic embargo\n\n\nSo in view of its western-styled economic reforms how important is\nit for Vietnam to normalise ties with the US now\n\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> Zainal Abidin spoke to Madam Ngoh Ba Tan\nVietnam's parliamentarian and chairwoman of its local mission at a business\nconference yesterday\n\n\nShe's here to promote investments from Singapore\n\n<$C> \n\nNow surely uhm we understand that the Americans' trade embargo\nis tied also to the uh the fact that uh excess of funds from international\nfinancial organisations are not able to reach Vietnam and these is important\nfor Vietnam because of its lacking of capital\n\n\nSo ah is the Vietnamese uh side doing anything to to ensure\nrelations get normalised soon \n\n\nNBT \n\n<$C> \n\nSo in other words you're saying that you're putting aside the\nuh matter of uh normalising relations with Vietnam and looking forward to\nextending relations with other nations perhaps with uh ASEAN you know how\nimportant is ASEAN to uh Vietnam's effort to stimulate its economy right now\n\n\n\nNBT \n\n<$C> \n\nSo when do you think you'll be ready to join ASEAN \n\n\nNBT \n\n<$C> \n\nBut what about the capitalistic system that is operating in\nthe ASEAN economies I mean uh which is still very new uh or Vietnam is still\nlearning about this system so how long will it take for Vietnam to to get\ninto this uh market economy or capitalistic economy so to speak\n\n\nWell the economic process in Vietnam has been going on since\nnineteen eighty six when it first introduced its own concept of economic\nrenovation or better known as doi moi and to further liberalise its economy\nthe Vietnamese National Assembly will next month pass a new constitution to\nprotect foreign interest from political interference\n\n\nThis will guarantee any legal assets and properties belonging to\nforeign investors from being nationalised\n\n\nBut will the new constitution be binding Madam Ngoh Ba Tan \n\n\nNBT \n\n<$A> \n\nAnd that was Ngoh Ba Tan chairwoman of Vietnam's local mission\nspeaking to Zainal Abidin on its commitment to foreign investors\n\n\nAnd that's all on our program this morning AM Singapore will be\nback again same time tomorrow with more stories behind the news\n\n\nFrom producer Peck Siok Lian and I Eleanor Nair goodbye \n\n \n\n\n12 Mar 1992 FM 90.5 \n\n<$D> \n\nThe British general election will be held on April the ninth\n\n\nThis has been much expected after Chancellor Norman Lermon\npresented what he called a budget for recovery for recession hit Britian\n\n\nThis will be one of the closest election campaigns in Britian since\nWorld War Two\n\n\nBritian's economy is at an all time low since the recession in the\nnineteen thirties\n\n\nSo who will win will depend on who can best fix the economy\n\n\nThe Conservative party led by Mr Major is also under pressure to\nwin a historic fourth term in office but it seems to be going into the\ncampaign trailing Labour\n\n\nThe latest opinion poll shows the Labour party stealing a three\npoint lead with forty-two per cent of the vote against thirty-nine per cent\nfor the Conservatives\n\n\nTo find out more about the British election Karen Won was on the\nline with Alan Beatty of the London School of Economics earlier this morning\n\n<$E> \n\nNow over the recent months Mr Major has brought the\nConservative Party very much to the centre away from the extreme right wing\n\n\nWill this accommodative style actually work to his advantage or\ndisadvantage you think \n\n\nAB \n\n<$E> \n\nIf indeed economic issues would take centre stage in this\nelection is the Labour party able to come up with an attractive counter\nbudget tailored for the ballot box as the Conservative Party has done \n\n\nAB \n\n<$E> \n\nBut what about the personalities of the candidate\n\n\nDo you think that uhm that would become an issue for example will\nMr Major be able to move out from under the shadow of Margaret Thatcher to\nwin a sizeable amount of votes \n\n\nAB \n\n<$E> \n\nNow uh looking at the polls recently it does seems that uhm\nthis is going to be a very close and exciting fight between the two parties\n\n\nNow do you think that a coalition government will become a\npossibility \n\n\nAB \n\n<$E> \n\nSo what role do you think uhm the liberal democratic party\nwill play in the process \n\n\nAB \n\n<$D> \n\nAnd that was Alan Beatty of the London School of Economics\n\n\nAnd the time now is twenty-three past seven\n\n\nWe turn to home next for a visit to the careers exhibition\n\n\nHome of opportunities\n\n\nThat's hall three at the uh at the World Trade Centre where the\ncareer ninety-two exhibition open yesterday\n\n\nThere students and young adults can shop for a job at any booth set\nup by the many industries which will offer information on what it takes to\nmake it in most if not all careers\n\n\nFor companies too it's a golden opportunity to recruit some\nurgently needed staff from the show's heavy turn out\n\n\nAnd some of them even handled out on the spot job applications\n\n\nBut for some sectors getting the right staff means giving or doing\na lot more than just participating in career exhibitions as Zainal Abidin\nfinds out\n\n<$F> \n\nI'm now at the Career ' 92 exhibition here at the World Trade\nCentre\n\n\nThere's quite a good spread of industries that are represented here\n\n\nEveryone equipped with their best possible paraphernalia and the\npromotional gadgetry trying to compete or capture the mostly young hearts in\nmind that have come in large numbers to see what's in store for them in the\ntimes to come\n\n\nBut the question that comes to my mind is how do the essential\nservices such as the police force the health care and the teaching profession\ncompete with other private companies which tend to be considered more\nglamourous for the best minds and bodies to come into the profession\n\n\nWell first uh I spoke to Mrs Tan Siew Kuan whose the spokesperson\nfor the police force\n\n<$G> \n\nUh you'll notice that we we have a very large crowd today here\nand uh year by year we have in fact been if I may say the most popular booth\n\n\nUh one of the reasons is because basically the inherent nature of\nthe job of the police is in itself very interesting very challenging very\nvaried\n\n\nSo because of these people are attracted by the the job the job\nitself\n\n\nSecondly our salaries are very competitive in terms of its uh entry\npoints in terms of uh its uhm I would say salary scales\n\n\nYah we are very very competitive\n\n<$F> \n\nBut it's to my knowledge that the police force is also facing\na shortage of staff or difficulty in recruiting the right staff into the\nforce\n\n\nNow how does it attract uhm or how does it compete for the uh\nbrains to come into the police force instead of going to other companies like\nthe Singapore Airlines or the the TDB or any other large corporations\n\n<$G> \n\nUh I would I would say that in terms of the people who wanted\nto join the police we have no difficulty getting the numbers uh neither do we\nhave difficulty getting the right type of people\n\n\nIn fact uh last year we had uh for junior officers we have four\nthousand six hundred and fifty-six applications\n\n\nFor senior officers we have about hundred and forty-six\napplications\n\n\nUh it is not that we are shortage of we have uh we are shortage of\nstaff it's more of the fact that our uh our resig uh our retirement rate is\nvery high\n\n\nAlright over the next few years in fact this year we will have\nfour hundred JOs who will be retiring when they reach their retirement age\nlimit so we need to recruit very large numbers to replace these retired\nofficers\n\n<$F> \n\nSo do you think you'll be able to do that through this uh\nexhibition and other promotional uh efforts\n\n<$G> \n\nYes uh basically the number of people who actually are\nattracted to join the police are people who come to the career exhibition\nyear by year and also through our press advertisements the respondents to our\npress advertisements\n\n\nBasically these two avenues are the are the places where large\nnumbers will apply\n\n<$F> \n\nBut when they join do they stay long\n\n<$G> \n\nYes they would alright they would stay for long because we\nhave a proper career development system for them yah \n\n<$F> \n\nJoining me now is Major Wong Wai Leong head of uh\nrecruitment I believe in the Singapore Arm Forces Em what do you think or\nwhat do you think you would need to do to bet <unclear> word </unclear> to\nget the best mind into the Arm Forces considering the fact there's very tight\nlabour market and great competition from private corporations em around here\nin Singapore? WWL: We're aware that the labour market is very tight and very\ncompetitive and that's the reason why the SAF has actually restructed the uh\nnon-commission uh officer core Uh we have now two uh new core one is the\nspecialist core and the other is the warrants officers' core Alright uh with\nthis two new core we aim to attract you know uh better uh educated personnel\nto join the SAF And at the same time this people will be groom for uh higher\nappointments and at the and also to ensure that they are promoted you know\nfast enough so as to ensure that they would stay on in the Arm Forces\n\n<$F> \n\nIn tangible terms what do you think are the real benefits or\nincentives that uh the new recruits can look to when they join the Arm\nForces? WWL: I think in terms of salary the SAF actually offers a very good\nuh terms in the sense that uh our salary is as good is uh at least twenty per\ncent more than the uh civil service right and uh we also continual\ncontinually uh study the market condition and review our term and terms and\nconditions as and when necessary\n\n<$F> \n\nThat was Major Wong Wai Leong talking to me earlier on at\nthis very impressive uh SAF uh counter or booth", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "32ce8c0c-17f9-4656-ab40-1c8b82c86d14", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.577461+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nMr Speaker Sir\n\n\nMr Speaker Sir\n\n\nAllow me to express my appreciation for this opportunity to\nparticipate in this debate\n\n\nSir I have uh noticed of late nearly all the ministers if not some\nof the members of parliament have been lamenting that there is a trend in\nSingapore for the people to make use of the reserves\n\n\nNow I do not know where they get this feedback other than the fact\nthat polls have been carried out and seems to give the impression that some\nSingaporeans are going for more use of the reserve\n\n\nI think the question here is what sort of question or rather\nquestionnaires were in fact put to the voters or to the uh resident of\nSingapore regarding the use of reserves\n\n\nNow if the question is simple one to say\n\n\nwould you want to make use of the reserve to improve your living\n\n\nI'm afraid the answer would be a yes simply yes But I think it is\nimportant here to draw a distinction between you know budgetary surpluses and\nall the surpluses accumulate by the statutory bodies over the years and the\nquestion should be rightly asked:\n\n\ndo you think the government should put all the surpluses in\nreserves and not just would you want to make use of reserve to improve your\nstandard of living\n\n\nI think if the question had been put differently you would get a\ndifferent set of answer\n\n\nNow there are from the poll it is quite that majority of\nSingaporean believe that Singapore should have more reserves that government\nshould put aside as reserve for rainy days I suppose\n\n\nThe question here is it is not whether the reserve should be spent\n\n\nI think the question here is what is the limit that the government\nshould put aside our surpluses as reserves Now what is the limit\n\n\nNow if that is the limit\n\n\nis not defined\n\n\nthere'll be no end to the whole thing\n\n\nEvery time you clamor for more subsidies you are being accused of\nutilising the reserves\n\n\nBut where where where do you stand\n\n\nDo do we say we keep on accumulate massive reserves at the same\ntime neglected certain area where we need to have more subsidies\n\n\nExample will be like education housing and health\n\n\nNow why is the government grudged that more subsidies be given in\nthe field of education\n\n\nFor the simple reason is now with more and more schools being\nconverted to independent schools you are confining to only twenty five\npercent of them having would be able to get scholarships\n\n\nNow what about the other seventy five percent of the students\n\n\nAre we assuming that all students that can manage to the\nindependent schools are from well-off family\n\n\nI I I thought statistics have already been given that most of them\nare from housing board estates\n\n\nthat would be a clear indication that they are either from the\nmiddle or lower income group\n\n\nAnd also it has been established or it is accepted fact that the\nonly resource we have in Singapore is the human resource\n\n\nNow why is the government not considering subsidising more for\neducation\n\n\nWe are so bogged down with the fear of our national reserve being\nused\n\n\nWe have in fact lost the true meaning of what is the question of uh\nreserve being utilised\n\n\nand what is the question of uh you know more subsidies in certain\nfield which is consider as investment\n\n\nThe government should when come to question of subsidies or\nreserves consider how much we should accumulate as reserves\n\n\nNot just you know keep on accumulating massive surpluses like ROV\n\n\nwe have uh more than uh one point seven billion and the HDB six\nhundred over billion million dollars and all the rest\n\n\nNow with with a new introduction of uh levies of three thousand uh\nforeign workers and sixty nine thousand of the maids\n\n\nthe government is going to collect over a billion dollars every\nyear for levies alone\n\n\nNow why are we you know every time when there is a clamor for\nsubsidies for an essential investment we are grudging to say that we are\neating into our reserves\n\n\nEven if it it so, so be it\n\n\nIt must be when we come to the field of education more people\nshould be subsidised\n\n\nwe are not not all the Singaporeans who send their children to\nschool are like all of us here who can afford it\n\n\nNot forgetting Sir if I may repeat again\n\n\nhere we have seven hundred fifty thousand people earning only eight\nhundred dollars a month and then we have four hundred fifty thousand people\nearning only one thousand dollars a month\n\n\nNow do you blame these people asking for more money to subsidise\ntheir children in school\n\n\nIt is out of necessity rather than with the intention to squander\naway the government reserves\n\n\nWe must do more for these people when these class of people clamor\nfor subsidies they should have our support because it is a genuine case for\nwant of support\n\n\nIt is not a case of squandering away our reserves for consumption\npurposes\n\n\nwhich of course I would even object\n\n\nI am not one for welfarism but I am one that our people should be\nsubsidised in the field of education in the field of housing\n\n\nI'm quite sure the government has got all the feedback\n\n\nThese are the two fields that the government ought to look into\n\n\nThe last election is a clear indication Singaporeans felt that with\nthe increasing fees and costs in education and health have burdened them\nunnecessarily to the extent that it may be you know financially unable to\ncope with the situation\n\n\nand uh I can give an exact example like it is like a millionaire\nmaking a will\n\n\nA millionaire making a will to the children\n\n\nbut in the will it's said that the children can only make use of\nthe money when they reach the age of twenty one\n\n\nbut in the meantime they could hardly subsist\n\n\nThey could not even live now but the will said no\n\n\nYou can't make use of the money until you reach an age of twenty\none\n\n\nNow why can't we use more of this money for the benefit of the\npeople in the field of education\n\n\nSir the next point Sir I would move to <unclear> word </unclear>\nthe question of the HDB upgrading Sir\n\n\nSir, the problem with you people is this you know you don't take\n\n\nyou can't criticism from us\n\n\nWhen I brought up the matter I merely explained the plight of a\nnumber of people\n\n\nJust I mentioned the fact that the plight of the retirees and the\nplight of those low income group has got no money for the upgrading\n\n\nWith that your reply is that well you are against upgrading\n\n\nbut any way it is not for my decision\n\n\nand luckily Sir the money don't belong to any one of you here\n\n\nIt is the people money and if the people want upgrading you have to\ngive it to them\n\n\nThis is what a democratic society is all about\n\n\nSir so my question here is uh before you call for vote in respect\nof housing board upgrading your flats will be improved and what would be the\nimprovement\n\n\nAnd then whether whether it would be spread over a period of time\n\n\nand whether in the long run you will have to there'll be no in\nincrease in the uh contribution of only ten percent\n\n\nwhy not\n\n\nNow it would appear that this' another pilot project just like uh\nthe you know kindergarten\n\n\nit's always pilot project\n\n\nYou know you use the term pilot project so that you can back back\nout any time you want\n\n\nWonderful word to use this pilot project and you know\n\n<$B> \n\nSpeaker Sir one note of clarification\n\n\nWill you allow me to question him on\n\n<$C> \n\nMr Ling you allow\n\n<$A> \n\nSir when the debate comes on the uh you know Ministry of uh\nHDB\n\n\nhere a lot of time to explain Sir\n\n\nHe'll have a lot of time to explain then Sir\n\n<$B> \n\nMr Speaker he's moved uh cut under my head\n\n<$A> \n\nMr Speaker Sir\n\n\nNow Now Mr Speaker Sir\n\n\nI I watched the television last night on a newsreel where they they\ndraw a comparison between the private housing estate to <unclear> word\n</unclear> upgrading and that of HDB\n\n\nSir I I think it's a very wrong comparison\n\n\nIt has no relevance at all\n\n\nSir you must always bear in mind one one factor\n\n\nWhen a developer bought over old flats they have it upgraded with\nprofit in mind\n\n\nIt is for sale so it is very different from HDB flats\n\n\nFor all for all you know you can't sell to anybody you want to sell\n\n\nYes that person must be qualified in the first place\n\n\nYou know the person must be qualified in the first place\n\n\nand firstly yes but you cannot sell to anybody you want\n\n\nYou have problem to\n\n<$B> \n\nMr Speaker a point of clarification\n\n\nI think he he must give me a chance to clarify otherwise he make a\nfool of himself\n\n<$A> \n\nSir Sir I I won't Sir\n\n\nBecause even at the last debate I was not given a chance even to\nto reply so why should I give him a chance to reply now Sir\n\n\nI'm not going to give him a chance to reply\n\n<$C> \n\nHey you continue then\n\n<$A> \n\nYes Sir\n\n\nSir the the private sector they upgrade they sell to the people\n\n\nSir in in the in the case of HDB flat dwell uh dwellers Sir the\ntenants there Sir\n\n\nmost of them would be stuck there for good because they would be\nstuck there for good simply because of this\n\n\nSir because if they sell they will not be most of them will not be\nable to buy another one because the prices keep going up\n\n\nSo it would be beyond the ability of most of the HDB flats to buy\nthat Sir\n\n\nBut you'll be happier I've to stay in the open air\n\n\nAfter you stay in open air you know is the is the community uh the\ndevelop uh department willing to help these people\n\n\nSir the the next point Sir I I won't want to dwell on this Sir uh\n\n\nso the next point would be Sir Sir if I remember correctly Sir uh\n\n\nsome time back before the introduction of the tax for PS uh that\ntelephone bill Sir\n\n\nThe government had wanted to give the first number of call free\nand subsequent to that they will impose a you know for every call they will\nimpose a a a charge on that\n\n\nLater on I believe a compromise came about\n\n\nOn the total bill the government impose a tax on the bill Sir\n\n\nNow with the introduction of the time-based system Sir I'm\nwondering why is the tax is still there Sir\n\n\nThe tax should have been abolished now because it's based on the\nnumber of use of the call\n\n\nTherefore the tax should be abolished Sir\n\n\nThank you Sir\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nCan I take a few minutes just to clarify two points\n\n\nJust five minutes\n\n\nJust to illustrate that uh obviously uh Mr Ling hasn't read the\npapers or try to make himself informed about HDB policies\n\n\nFirst of all he said that uh an HDB owner cannot sell his flat\nanybody except to those who qualify\n\n\nBut the qualification or the eligibility is so widely defined that\nmore than ninety percent of Singaporeans qualify\n\n\nAn HDB owner can sell a flat to any PR any citizen\n\n\nthere's no limit on income there's no limit on ownership of\nprivate private property\n\n\nSo this means that an owner of HDB flat can sell his flat to\nalmost anybody in Singapore\n\n\nThere is no restriction of course it's true\n\n\nOnly requirement is that the person stays in the flat that he\nshould not buy the HDB flat as an investment \n\n\nAnybody can buy an HDB flat on a second-hand market even if he\nowns a private property there's no limit on income and he can be a PR or a\ncitizen So this covers almost everybody in Singapore aright So he should get\nthis point first Secondly on upgrading Obviously he has not read I said\nalmost everybody If Mr Chiam is advocating that a single person should be\nallowed to buy a five-room flat and I think he should bring it up we can\ndebate that point whether Singapore can afford it But I did not say everybody\nin Singapore Mr Speaker Sir I said almost everybody In fact the market is so\nwide that it should not affect the resale value Secondly on upgrading of\ncourse all the facts are made available to those who are affected by\nupgrading How much will be spent on the interior of the flat how much will be\nspent within the block how much will be spent outside the block and not just\ntheir sums but the exact items of upgrading Before they're asked to vote and\nthey're not just merely told in descriptive language There're plans there're\nmodels there're firms So I think the member before he speaks on this should\nmake himself fully I mean he should inform himself and if he doesn't know\nabout it he should put a question maybe we can gain the clarification but he\nshould not make a speech without even taking the trouble to find out the\nfacts", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "7ebdc2ea-369e-4d06-9bb6-eb99aad8ede3", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.578602+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nSir number of uh members have uh spoken on the tax relief for\nreservists\n\n\nI thought I want to uh briefly respond to some of the points\n\n\nUh firstly Mr Leong Hong Kee uh suggested instead of the uh thousand\ndollars tax relief for active reservists and uh five hundred for non-active\nreservists\n\n\nthat we change to a different system of giving a hundred dollars and\nfifty dollars flat rate\n\n\nSir there're many different ways of uh providing a tax relief\n\n\nuh the flat rate is one way\n\n\nthe method that we propose is another uh Mindef is looking into this\nproblem uh fairly extensively over the last year or so\n\n\nUh I prefer the uh method that we propose on a number of reasons on\na number of grounds\n\n\nFirstly the proposal that we have is symbolic\n\n\nIt's it shows very clearly government's deep appreciation and\ngratitude the reservists for the uh sacrifices that they've made for the\ncontributions that they continue to make uh to the nation's well-being by\nproviding security and peace\n\n\nThese are the essentials\n\n\nthese are the foundations upon which the nation is able to progress\nand to prosper\n\n\nSir the method that we propose is also simple and comes closest to\nwhat as been uh considered by the uh record committee and uh recommended by\nthe uh reservists\n\n\nI think if Mr Leong were to look into the uh details and uh look at\nthe numbers he will probably share the uh conclusion that I uh have arrived\nat\n\n\nnamely the proposal that Mindef has come out with is beneficial\nmuch more beneficial to reservists in the long run because this way as the\nyears go by as the income of reservists increases the amount of uh relief\nthat they get will increase\n\n\nin other words the tax that they pay will be diminished by a bigger\nmargin than the flat rate of fifty dollars or a hundred dollars Indeed if\n<unclear> word </unclear> workers were to have the pay increase by an average\nabout seven percent per year over a ten-year period you'll be talking about\nalmost a doubling of the income and over a forty-year period\n\n\nwhich is what we are going to give in terms of tax relief to uh\nreservists from the age of twenty\n\n\nand if they continue working until they're sixty there's a\nforty-year period\n\n\nthat Mr Leong were to sit down and do some calculations he will\nappreciate that the uh relief that we are giving is not insignificant\n\n\nSo Mr Chiam has said that the tax relief is too small which does\nsuggest that uh if it were bigger he would have given his uh full support\n\n\nAnd yet at the same time he says we should not make any uh monetary\nuh reward any monetary recognition because in so doing if money is involved\nthen we make mercenaries out of our reservists Is that right\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nSir Mr Chiam may not be aware of the fact that uh we are\nalready making allowances of all sorts to our reservists\n\n\nWe give the key appointment holders a key appointment uh uh holder\nallowance\n\n\nnd allowance\n\n\nOthers we have a service uh allowance and uh for all the uh\nreservists we have a make-up pay\n\n\nDoes Mr Chiam therefore suggesting that we take away all these\nallowances because money is involved\n\n<$B> \n\nSir can I clarify\n\n<$C> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B  <  \n\n\nThank you thank you\n\n\nNow money are given in all kinds of ways but if you give in a form\nof a reward then it is wrong in principle\n\n\nbut if you give to compensate for his transport allowance for his\nloss of earning I think that is fair\n\n\nThat this this completely different principle payments are made out\non a different principles\n\n\nBut if there is going to be appreciation you can give him a plaque\n\n\nyou can put him on a pedestal\n\n\nand give him a clap or you can put up a statue\n\n\nThese these are different kinds these are different kinds of\nappreciation\n\n\nSo we must appreciate what sort of appreciation we are giving and\nnot to dish out money and we say we're happy that you are doing reservist\n\n\nI think that is wrong in principle\n\n\nThat is my point\n\n<$A> \n\nSir I think uh Mr Chiam is entitled to his point of view\n\n\nWhat we have done is to structure it in a manner that it expresses\nthe nation's appreciation\n\n\nIt's a symbolic gesture the amount of money is a matter of\ndifference of uh\n\n\nit's a matter of opinion whether it's large or otherwise but making\nrecognition through a monetary system need not necessarily make mercenaries\nout of our people\n\n\nSir indeed mercenaries are really soldiers professional soldiers\nwho fight in foreign armies not our own people being paid or being given a uh\na a monetary uh recognition\n\n\nIndeed armies all over the world pay their soldiers that doesn't\nmake all the soldiers of the world mercenaries\n\n\nSo we give allowances to our national servicemen\n\n\nIs Mr Chiam therefore saying that we should not do that\n\n\nSir Dr John Chen suggests that because Mr uh Chiam said that he's\nnot in favour of this system we should not uh make uh payment to uh or make\nthe uh system make the uh tax relief available to uh reservists in Potong\nPasir\n\n\nSir I don't think we should do that because I don't believe I don't\nbelieve Mrs Mr Chiam speaks for the uh reservists in Potong Pasir\n\n\nBut if there are if there should be any reservist in Potong Pasir\nwho shares Mr Chiam's point of view they can easily opt out the system by not\nmaking the claim by not making\n\n<$B> \n\nCan can I can I have a second clarification\n\n<$C> \n\nAre you giving away\n\n<$A> \n\nSir if the if Mr Chiam will just let me finish the sentence\n\n<$C> \n\nAll right Mr Chiam\n\n\nYou can seek your clarification later\n\n<$A> \n\nIf any reservist in Potong Pasir shares Mr Chiam's point of\nview and think that recognition through a monetary system is not appropriate\nthey can very easily opt out of it next year by not making a claim\n\n\nIt is as simple as that\n\n<$C> \n\nYes Mr Chiam\n\n<$B> \n\nSir there are two points I want to raise\n\n\nfirstly whenever I put up a criticism they will point to Potong\nPasir\n\n\nPotong Pasir can always opt out\n\n\nWhere are we going to end\n\n\nVery soon there'll be more than one Potong Pasir and what's going\nto happen\n\n\nThey can all opt out\n\n\nSo can if they are not happy with their income tax can they opt out\n\n\nI would like to ask the Minister of Finance for that\n\n\nIf we are unhappy we criticise the income tax property tax Can we\nopt out\n\n\nSir that that is the first point\n\n\nSir the the second point is that Sir in in regard to to this whole\nmatter of uh enough or not enough the the whole idea is wrong so\n\n\nit's not a question of quantum the quantum is is no longer an issue\n\n\nIt is it is it is it is the principle that is involved\n\n\nso so if you are going to give monetary rewards for service to the\nnation then where are we going to end\n\n\nBecause service to the nation cannot be measured by money terms and\nwe all know that Public service this kind of things services to charity these\nare all in the same category\n\n\nso this kind of work we do out of either commitment or either of\nservice or duty to the nation or for the love of it\n\n<$C> \n\nMr Chiam are you making a speech or you're seeking\nclarification\n\n\nMr Chiam\n\n<$B> \n\nBut certainly it is not for the money\n\n\nThat is the last thing in mind\n\n<$A> \n\nSir Mr Chiam Mr Chiam obviously didn't hear what I say\n\n\nI say that I do not agree with Dr John Chen not to make that uh tax\nrelief available to all reservists in Potong Pasir\n\n\nNo but if you speak on behalf of them and indeed if there are\nreservists who believe exactly as you do which I think will be exceedingly\nsmall number\n\n\nThen as I said they can easily exercise their right not to claim\nnot to make that claim next year\n\n\nSir I think we've spent enough time on uh Mr Chiam we move on\n\n\nUh Dr Ho Peng uh Mr Ho Peng he has suggested that uh now we should\nconsider not making available the tax relief for those who have completed\ntheir reservist training and also for those who are not doing any reserves uh\nnot uh actively in reserve\n\n\nThis is a distinct possibility which we look at uh during the\nconsideration of this proposal uh made by record\n\n\nSo what that means is we will only be making a tax relief available\nfor thirteen years because uh most of the reservists will serve a\nthirteen-year in-camp training cycle\n\n\nand after that after that they will not have not enjoy any tax\nrelief at all\n\n\nSo over the last eleven years I've been round the uh army camps the\nbases\n\n\nI've been into the jungle with our soldiers\n\n\nI've seen them training and I appreciate the amount of effort that\nthey put in\n\n\nI appreciate the amount of sacrifices they've put in\n\n\nI believe that we should express in a manner that is commensurate\nwith the way in which the uh soldiers have put in terms of sacrifices and\ncontribution to the nation for us\n\n\nI have therefore decided that the tax relief will be available even\nafter they've completed their reservist training\n\n\nIn other words it's an expression life-long expression on the part\nof the government for the uh reservists as long as he's contributed in\nnational service\n\n\nas long as he's contributed in reserves he will continue to receive\nthat tax relief or be it at a slightly lower level\n\n\nWhen they're doing active uh reserve training we give them a relief\nat a higher level\n\n\nSir there's also a small number of people who for medical reasons\nlargely uh do not uh carry on to do reserves uh after they've finished their\nNS\n\n\nI've decided that it would be mean it would be mean on the part of\nMindef not to allow these people also to enjoy the tax relief\n\n\nand therefore I've decided that they too will enjoy the tax relief\nagain at the lower level of five hundred dollars instead of a thousand\n\n\nI will really be splitting hairs to say that reserve service is\nmuch more important much more valuable\n\n\nand therefore to be regarded at a higher level recognised by the\ngovernment but not national service which all of them have completed\n\n\nAnd that is the basis that is the reason for my deciding to make\nthe tax relief available to all all who have completed national service but\nfor those who are in active reserve to receive a slightly higher level of tax\nrelief\n\n\nSo Dr John Chen and uh Mr Liew Sing Paw both uh reservist officers\nhave uh spoken uh positively of the uh tax relief\n\n\nUh our own uh indications surveys had uh shown that majority of\nSingaporeans support this particular relief\n\n\nUh Mr Liew suggested that indicated that this does give uh\nreservists a very much higher level of status and I agree with him\n\n\nIndeed Mindef will be uh liaising with the Ministry of Defence to\nuh encourage the Ministry of Defence\n\n\nI beg your pardon\n\n\nMindef will be liaising with the Ministry of Finance to encourage\nthe Ministry of Finance to put a star next to the names of all reservists \n\n\nPeople with a star will enjoy the tax relief for life as long as\nthey're working as long as they're contributing towards Singapore's\nprosperity Thank you Sir Mr Chiam: Sir may I <unclear> word </unclear> an\norder Sir Sir just now Mr John Chen spoke up in favour of the tax relief Now\nI was not aware that he was an active officer It's just just been told that\nhe was an active officer He should have declared an interest because he's\ngoing to get money for interest Mr Speaker: Yes Mr Hu Mr Chiam: He's going to\nget monetary rewards Mr <unclear> word </unclear> : Can I make one point of\nclarification Mr Speaker: Yes Mr <unclear> word </unclear> : I think I was\nmisunderstood on one point I was uh talking just now about those people who\nhave done NS but do not do reservist because they're exempted from health I\nthink uh the Minister of Defence has covered that point which I I take I did\nnot actually argue a case for not giving a tax relief for those who have\ncompleted reservist I fully agree that those who have completed reservist\nshould enjoy some form of tax relief which is a case here Dr Yeo Ning Hong:\nSir I covered that point but uh maybe I just repeat it once more Uh if you\ngive if you give those who have served who have completed National Service\nand has served in the reserves thirteen years of tax relief and then carry on\nuntil they are sixty or sixty five then in effect you're giving them tax\nrelief for forty or more years But for those who have completed National\nService but for some reason or other mainly medical do not carry on to do\nreserves You are basically saying that they are entitled to nothing It's too\nbig a discrepancy You're putting too high a value on the thirteen-year cycle\nuh reserve uh service and ignoring completely the contributions that they've\nmade during National Service Sir I believe that is splitting hair It's\nunrealistic to say that reserve service is much more valuable and therefore\nhave to be recognised in a much more uh uh dramatic manner than National\nService because National Service is duty I prefer to put it this way They\nhave served they have served their National Service Many of them go on to\nserve in the reserves for thirteen years because they have done that the\ngovernment is is grateful the government reflects the nation's gratitude for\ntheir sacrifices for their contributions And because of that I'm prepared\nindeed I was prepared and urged the government to be generous in making sure\nthat the tax relief is available for life Mr Chiam: May I make a further\nclarification Why should the government be grateful It's the people of\nSingapore that should be grateful Dr Yeo Ning Hong: That's what I said On\nbehalf of the people Mr Chiam: The soldiers are defending the country the\nwhole country and it is for the whole nation to show appreciation and respect\nfor them and it is not the little group of people who call themselves\ngovernment They don't serve this little group of people who call themselves\ngovernment They are serving the nation they are in fact defence of the whole\nnation So why do you say the government is grateful and she must show\nappreciation Dr Yeo Ning Hong: Sir I think time is moving on Sir the\ngovernment must obviously Sir the government must obviously be representative\nof the people We operate a democracy in case uh Mr Chiam is not aware of it\nWe were elected by the people to represent the people and the government acts\non behalf of the people and as I said earlier we reflect we reflect the\ngovernment reflects the nation the people's gratitude and appreciation for\nthe reservists and for the National servicemen's sacrifice and contribution\nYou repeat exactly what I say and you're just saying it again and again Mr\nSpeaker: Order I think we've gone on this point long enough We can continue\nin the committee of supply Mr Goh", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL",

{"text": "<$A> \n\nwithdraw his amendment <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nAmendment number two thirty minutes Mr Chng\n\n<$B> \n\nMr Chairman Sir I beg to move that the sum to be allocated for\nhead to be reduced by ten dollars in respect of code fifteen hundred of the\nmain estimates\n\n\nSir my subject is uh fixing of airline fares\n\n\nSometime last year about twenty airlines which fixes air fares in\nSingapore in a cartel called the Intra-Marketing Program collapsed in the\nprocess\n\n\nuh air fares to London were literally halved what it was\n\n\nBut for the last several years in nineteen uh eighty nine there was\na different program called market development program which again form a\nsimilar airlines uh to regulate set minimum prices for air fares\n\n\nAll this fixing of air fares out of Singapore is to the disadvantage\nof the consumers the Singaporeans especially\n\n\nThis fixing of air fares leads to ridiculous <unclear> word\n</unclear> whereby it's cheaper for Malaysians to travel from Kuala Lumpur to\nSingapore and to London than for Singaporeans to travel from Singapore to\nLondon\n\n\nAll because of price fixing in Singapore\n\n\nSir I don't think this uh switching is tenable\n\n\nI believe that the Minister should do something about it\n\n\nPerhaps let me quote what he said in uh fifteen of January nineteen\nninety in reply to question on deregulation of uh the oil prices\n\n\nUh may I quote from <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nSir He said at that time\n\n\nDeregulation encourages competition among oil companies\n\n\nIt forces them to operate efficiently and to be more responsive to\nthe needs of the consumers\n\n\nIt allows the free market to determine the real price for the\nproduct\n\n\nand it's therefore fair and economically rational\n\n\nThe government does not regulate the prices of food transportation\nor other basic necessities in Singapore\n\n\nthe competition to bring down prices and prevent profiteering\n\n\nSo my question to the Minister is that this fixing of airline fares\nhas been going on for a long time to the disadvantage of consumers\n\n\nand my uh particular question is also a general one is if in the\nevent whereby a fixed number of suppliers of goods comes together fixed\nprices to the disadvantage of consumers\n\n\nlike if oil companies come together to fix all the prices what will\nbe the Ministry's stand whether he will apply administrative pressure or will\nhe move a bill in Parliament to prevent this happening Sir\n\n<$A> \n\nQuestion is that the sum could be allocated for head or now\nhead could be reduced by ten dollars in respect of code a fifteen hundred of\nthe main estimates Mr Khoo\n\n<$C> \n\nMr Chairman Sir I'll like to declare my interest\n\n\nI'm a staff at the uh NTU with the views I express today will be\nentirely be mine\n\n\nSir the government has already committed to giving more money for R\n& D eventually up to one percent of GDP and and uh in the near future up to\nfive percent of GDP\n\n\nThis money can be a force for jacking up productivity or it may be\nso much money down the drain\n\n\nHow to measure success and failure in R & D is very subjective\n\n\nLet me draw two parallels across the Pacific IBM in America and\nSony in Japan\n\n\nBoth companies are renowned for their industrial prowess\n\n\nTheir empires stand the globe and their names are synonymous with\ncreativity inventiveness and profitability until lately of course\n\n\nLast year IBM lost money\n\n\nThe ideas and products did not set the world on fire\n\n\nOften they lost to products and ideas coming out from the American\nresearch backyards\n\n\nAnd then in spite the fact that Big Blue spent US six billion\ndollars for R & D about fourteen percent of Singapore's GDP\n\n\nI repeat fourteen percent of Singapore's GDP and that on one item\nmainly uh infotech\n\n\nCan we spend one percent of our GDP and hope to succeed in\neverything from biomedical technology to engineering to botany chemistry\n\n\nI think we must find uh some market niches and not spread our\nresources too thinly\n\n\nBut I want to ask the people question Is IBM's R & D achievement a\nsuccess or a failure\n\n\nSome would say that it is a resounding success\n\n\nLook at the results\n\n\nIn the eighties IBM won won two Nobel Prize winners\n\n\nShe has filed over thirty three thousand patents and her\nresearchers have published thousand and thousands of academically acclaimed\nand cited academic papers\n\n\nAlong the corridors of their research lab hundreds of hi-tech\nwizards are peering the telescopes looking for tomorrow's solution apparently\nforgetting today's needs\n\n\nSir can we afford the ideal model\n\n\nIf we cannot I'll be looking elsewhere\n\n\nI suggest if we're looking elsewhere we look at Japan's Sony the\nworld's most inventive and creative company\n\n\nHow they do R & D and how they motivate their R & D staff should be\nan inspiration for Singapore for three reasons\n\n\nFirst their R & D is market-driven and success means the ability to\ntranslate an idea into commercial success\n\n\nin other words there's a return on investment\n\n\nSecond the technology level in Singapore is closer to to Sony's\nthan to IBM's\n\n\nAnd third to me the most important their expenditure Sony's\nexpenditure in R & D is something we can achieve\n\n\nLast year Sony spent one point five billion US dollars five point\nseven percent of their revenue were about three point five percent of our GDP\nSingapore's GDP\n\n\nThose figures are realistic for us\n\n\nWithin a short term reach of Singapore's R & D plan Sony's re\nachievement is remarkable Fortune magazine calls Sony's R & D engineers the\nworld's most prolific and innovative\n\n\nEveryday they turn out four new products\n\n\nSir I think there's a lesson in Sony's R & D that we can learn and\nthat the best auditing tool for R & D lies in the market\n\n\nThat's why Sony succeeds and IBM hasn't succeeded so well I wonder\nif the Minister for Trade and Industry agrees\n\n\nThank you\n\n<$A> \n\nOthman\n\n<$D> \n\nMr Chairman Sir my subject is measures to check inflation\n\n\nMr Chairman Sir workers are generally very anxious about increases\nin cost of living\n\n\nUh stated in the Economic Survey of Singapore nineteen ninety one\nmost of the inflation in nineteen ninety one was due to domestic factors\n\n\nUnlike external factors which are beyond our control government can\nwork out an interim measure to check domestic sources of inflation and\nparticularly profiteering\n\n\nI would like to ask the Minister to outline what measures his\nMinistry has to check the rise in the cost of living\n\n\nSir although our inflation rate is low compared to other countries\nour current rate is high compared to the average rate for the last five years\n\n\nWe saw low rates of inflation in nineteen eighty seven to eighty\nnine\n\n\nMany increases which led to high inflation in nineteen ninety one\nwere introduced in nineteen ninety\n\n\nFor example the increase increases in the cost of transport MRT\nfares bus fares and so on\n\n\nAnd for nineteen ninety two there are new levies\n\n\nI think members of the House have uh mentioned many of these new\nlevies\n\n\nNow there is also this increase in the water conservation tax on\ndomestic and domestic customers\n\n\nHave we considered how much it will add to inflation\n\n\nAfter all we use water for most daily and many products also use\nwater\n\n\nSir I agree that uh we must do all we can to discourage high and\nwasteful consumption We import our water\n\n\nHowever instead of a tax which increase or which can lead to an\nincrease in cost we should consider incentives like a rebate for those who\nreduce water consumption\n\n\nSir urgent measures are necessary to monitor and check inflation\nand especially to counter profiteering\n\n\nThe Minister has just stated that uh we must moderate demands on\nwages and I think uh stability in cost of living can help to do this\n\n\nThank you\n\n<$A> \n\nMr Leong\n\n<$E> \n\nMr Chairman Sir I've only one card this time\n\n\nIt's good Sir for last two years every year Incik Othman Harun\nYusof and myself speak on this subject\n\n\nthereby I think it's my duty to speak on it again\n\n\nNow inflation in nineteen ninety one Sir last year according to the\nConsumer Price Index was three point five percent\n\n\nThe Minister for Finance has mentioned yesterday that the strong\nSing dollar has helped to check inflation\n\n\nSir the fear of an inflationary trend as Incik Othman has said is\nalways in the minds of the people\n\n\nJust today you read the papers in the Business Times in the back\npage of the Business Times the Bank of Tokyo has predicted that for Singapore\nour inflation will achieve growth this year to three point nine percent and\nthen in nineteen ninety three would be four point five percent\n\n\nWhile we may not want to believe all these forecasts of economic\ndoom and failures I think it's useful for our Minister of Trade Industry to\nactually be mindful of inflationary pressures that I'll like to ask again\nthis question this year\n\n\nWhat measures is the Ministry taking to check inflation\n\n<$A> \n\nIncik Yatiman\n\n<$F> \n\nMr Chairman Sir Singapore's economy had long been known as one\nthat is closely related to trading and services\n\n\nIndustrialisation and manufacturing expansion were made after\nseparation in nineteen sixty five Further development in the sector was made\nmuch later further development in service sector was made much later\n\n\nSir compared to other industrialised countries in Europe America\nand Japan Singapore has extremely short period for development of our local\nenterprise Our initial objective of overcoming massive unemployment and\nattracting investment had resulted with special emphasis given to the MNCs\nand foreign investors\n\n\nOur desire to globalise had resulted with further infusion of\ncapital from big business and manufacturing corporation\n\n\nthus providing highly paid and also highly skilled oriented jobs to\nour population\n\n\nApart from this we also have government related companies in which\nthe Minister had kindly touched earlier which are involved in a number of uh\nmanufacturing and service activities\n\n\nSir despite the existence of this rather harsh environment we have\nseen the emergence of small and medium enterprises which are beginning to\nglobalise their operation\n\n\nIn this respect I wish to thank the Minister of Finance yesterday\nfor his very elaborate answer on various incentive given to our local SMEs\nSir the question of promoting our local enterprise\n\n\nIt was raised again and again in this House\n\n\nWe are happy that the government had looked into this matter\nseriously\n\n\nDr Goh Keng Swee the founder of ADB had this to say\n\n\nbusiness people do not embark on new ventures for political\nobjective\n\n\nThey do so on a calculation of profits and we want to introduce\nthem to develop new industrial enterprises\n\n\nwe must make the economic setting suitable for the promotion of\nthis activity\n\n\nThat was in nineteen sixty one\n\n\nNow the EDB annual report stated that there are three thousand\ninternational and over seventy thousand local enterprises have set their\nbusinesses here\n\n\nIt is also important to note that during the same period the South\nKorean embarked on different part of development following the Japanese\n\n\nThey encouraged the agglomeration of local enterprises provided\nfinancial backing and called in the expert to build their local giant\nenterprises\n\n\nThese are the enterprises together with their smaller feeder\nsupport enterprises that are seen expanding their operation abroad\n\n\nWe on the other hand invited the MNCs improve our economic\ninfrastructures and set up a number of government-owned or government-linked\ncorporations\n\n\nIn view of the above Sir\n\n\napart from the measures and facilities mentioned by the Minister\nof Finance the step by step privatisation of our stat board mentioned by MPI\nwhat are the other plans and measures the MPI has in mind to encourage the\ngrowth of our local enterprise\n\n\nThank you Sir\n\n<$A> \n\nOrder\n\n<$E> \n\nResumption of the Committee of Supply on the estimates of\nexpenditure for the financial year first April nineteen ninety two to thirty\nfirst March nineteen ninety three \n\n\nMr Speaker Head w Ministry of Trade and Industry amendment number\ntwo the question is that the sum to be allocated for head w be reduced by ten\ndollars in respect of code w a fifteen hundred of the main estimates General\nLee Mr Lim Boon Heng: Mr Chairman Sir Mr Yatiman Yusof has uh asked about our\nstrategy for developing local businesses He pointed the difference between\nSouth Korea and Singapore Well there are significant differences between\nKorea and Singapore Firstly South Korea has a population of forty three\nmillion which is fourteen times that of Singapore They also have a land area\none hundred and fifty times ours Their large domestic market provide the\nopportunity for the development of sizeable indigenous companies which can\ntake advantage of their economies of scale Singapore on the other hand with a\nsmall population has had to look overseas for investors in the first step of\nour industrialisation We brought in foreign capital and multinational\ncompanies that have world class technology and know-how and the linkages with\nforeign markets where they export to And Singapore has benefited from the\nparticipation of multinational companies in our economic development Our\nlocal industries have benefitted from the technological transfers new markets\nand business partnerships with them As far as the local businesses are\nconcerned the array of uh existing schemes have already been uh repeated many\ntimes so I will just like to stress one particular initiative and that is the\nformation of linkages or economic groupings Here we encourage our local uh\nSMEs to form linkages with multinational companies and with the\ngovernment-linked companies for mutual benefit So this I hope will be taken\nup by the small and medium sized enterprises I would like to conclude by\npointing out that our small and medium sized enterprises have not been doing\ntoo badly Since nineteen eighty six their value added per worker in\nmanufacturing has improved by about nine percent a year which is better than\nthe industry average of seven percent So by making use of the many existing\nschemes available to them and by linking up with the SMEs and GLCs our local\nfirms can hope to maintain and improve their performance", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "34633be5-57d0-496a-8db6-24ed1c68e195", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.581164+00:00"}

like to speak on a subject that has been\nraised many times both by my parliamentary colleagues and myself\n\n\nI will not bore the House with all the details or the arguments\nwhich have been sufficiently dealt with on previous occasions\n\n\nThe issue is an extension of medical benefits to the family of\nfemale civil servants\n\n\nSurely the Minister will agree with me that our female civil\nservants work as hard as and as competently as their male counterparts\n\n\nI'm sure the Minister would also agree with me that that at the\nprincipal the civil servant or any employer for that matter should employ and\nreward staff based on their ability and performance and not by their sex\n\n\nThe last time this issue was raised the Finance Minister did give\nthe indication that he may look into this matter at an appropriate time\n\n\nI do urge the Minister to give some serious thought and\nconsideration to the request\n\n\nThis time I hope the Minister will not give me a 'no' for

fifteen hundred of the main\nestimates\n\n\nMr Chairman under our current system of corporate tax losses of\ncompanies are allowed to be carried forward to offset subsequent years\nprofits\n\n\nSir but if there is a change in substantial ownership or rather\nsubstantial change in ownership these tax losses are not allowed to be\ncarried forward\n\n\nSir in nineteen eighty eight the rule was modified to allow certain\nsituations of substantial change of ownership in which companies could\ncontinue to make use of these tax losses\n\n\nThese situations were mainly those of <unclear> word </unclear>\nsuch as changes as a result of nationalisation or privatisation or the\ncompanies' shares being widely traded on a recognised stock exchange\n\n\nand provided that such changes are not made for the purpose of tax\nbenefit or advantage\n\n\nSir although this concession in nineteen eighty eight was better\nthan nothing uh it still fall short of what is required in the market\n\n\nSir I do agree with the the Finance Minister that there is merit in\nnot allowing loss-making companies to be tax sheltered\n\n\nbut I do feel that there are some group of companies that require\nsome form of relief from this rule in particularly I mean uh young start out\ncompanies\n\n\nSir these are companies started by enterprising daring\nentrepreneurs with good ideas and with the money maybe for their own from\ntheir own savings as well as support from their friends but with lots of guts\nand belief in themselves and their ideas\n\n\nSir for such companies it is quite usual for them to suffer losses\nin the earlier years especially when they are small difficult to get finance\nand trying to develop their ideas into marketable products and services\n\n\nOften after a while new capital is necessary\n\n\nSir at this stage the poor entrepreneur will normally try to\ninterest a large company to buy a part of the company\n\n\nSir large companies normally were once controlling interest and\nprovided the price is correct\n\n\nTax losses then can become an issue for if the losses can be\ncarried forward it may be worthwhile for the company to take over the\nmajority of the ailing company\n\n\nSo because of this issue sometimes the deal falls through\n\n\nBut even if the deal gets uh carried through often the entrepreneur\nhas to sell off at a very paltry price\n\n\nMy question is this: should we not help such enterprise in\nSingaporeans considering that we are trying to promote entrepreneurship\n\n\nShouldn't he be allowed to recoup some of his losses via a better\nprice if the tax losses can be carried forward even if there is a change in\nownership\n\n\nSir in such cases if we do allow the tax losses to be carried\nforward\n\n\nI think uh we will definitely encourage more entrepreneurship and\nperhaps more struggling companies with good futures may be saved and who\nknows Sir some of these companies may become your future SIAs and the Keppel\nCorporations\n\n\nSo Sir I would like to cons ask the Minister to consider my\nproposal of waiving the substantial ownership rule for such companies and in\ncase he is fearful of abuse I can think straightaway of a number of controls\nfor him\n\n\nSir like for example tax losses can only be offset offsetted\nagainst profits in the same trade\n\n\nAnother one could be like the qualifying company should be smaller\ncompanies like I've described above So for companies of say uh ten million\ndollars of shareholders' funds or below and three could be say the limit the\ntax losses incurred for the say past few years prior to the substantial\nchange in ownership so say for three years\n\n\nSir I'm very sure that there are many others but the purpose of my\nbringing up these few controls is to show that there are ways of controlling\ntax loss companies from becoming general tax shelters because I think that is\nthe main fear of the Minister Sir may I continue my second cut\n\n<$B> \n\nYes yes\n\n<$D> \n\nSir on the second cut first I would like to say that in my\nconstituency besides HDB estates there are also quite a number of private\nresidential estates some new but many old\n\n\nSir with the assistance given by the government for HDB upgrading\nand the sales of HDB shops to sitting tenants\n\n\nSome of my private residential well private estates uh residents\nhave asked me whether the government would also help them to renovate in\nother words to upgrade their capital assets in other words their residential\nproperties especially with respect to the older properties built in the\nfifties and sixties\n\n\nSir any assistance in this area means either higher expenditure by\nthe government or lesser revenue to the government\n\n\nand I think the Finance Minister holds the purse strings and so I\nthink he is the best person to answer such queries whether or not the\ngovernment would help\n\n\nSir the question is this:\n\n\nshould he entertain request for financial assistance from sources\nother than HDB residents\n\n\nThe HDB residents are today highly subsidised by the government in\nterms of the sales price for their flats in terms of maintenance and running\nof their estate and in terms of for example the upgrading that the government\nthe is going to go ahead and even the sale of shops to the sitting tenants\n\n\nSir as one of the private estate resident remark:\n\n\nif the government wishes to distribute some fat surely we should\nteeny weeny bit\n\n\nMoreover I would like to add that not all private property dwellers\nare rich\n\n\nNot all private properties are sparkling new bungalows or full\nfacility condominiums\n\n\nThere are many old developments some even along the major roads\n\n\nPerhaps the Minister can consider their request for some assistance\n\n\nIn fact if I remember Sir in nineteen seventy or from nineteen\nseventy to nineteen seventy eight there was a garden tax for the maintenance\nof uh garden tax remission for the maintenance of gardens in line with the\ngarden city concept\n\n\nSo here if these old developments are an eyesore it might be worth\nhelping in a similar way\n\n\nSir to prevent abuse it could always be limited to those properties\nabove a certain age and below a certain market value\n\n\nSir I I shall leave the actual numbers to the Minister since he has\nthe necessary information to have the correct cut off provided of course he\nagrees with the idea\n\n\nSir I beg to move\n\n<$B> \n\nQuestion is that the sum to be allocated for Head N be reduced\nby ten dollars in respect of Code N fifteen hundred of the main estimates Dr\nHu\n\n<$C> \n\nMr Chairman Sir\n\n\non the question of uh carry forward of losses up to now we have\nbeen satisfied that the arrangements introduced so far were satisfactorily\n\n\nUh the reason for this is up to now we have received thirty four\napplications for such approvals\n\n\nHalf were approved but the rest the ones which were not approved\nwere rejected because there was suggestions or indications that my companies\nwere bought over for tax reasons However uhm Mr Heng has brought up a\ndifferent category of companies\n\n\nHe's talking about new small companies who face peculiar problems\nproblems peculiar to themselves where a general application of rules applying\nto all companies big and large might work to their disadvantage\n\n\nI'm prepared to consider looking at this as a special case and uh I\nwill ask officer to examine and perhaps we'll approach Mr Heng for more\ndetails of the suggestions he has indicated and we will certainly consider it\n\n\nThe idea is not to penalise companies but to ensure that in the\nprocess of granting these concessions that uh the government not taken\nadvantage of\n\n\nBut if there are ways in which we can ease the problems of\ncompanies by administrative changes I'm quite prepared to do so\n\n\nThe second point he's raised is tax relief or upgrading of private\nresidential properties\n\n\nThis is a problem which always arises when we give some something\ngovernment gives some to some sectors of the population the request will be\nmade:\n\n\nwhy not extend it to someone else\n\n\nAnd I think it's a fair question but I'll like to point out that\nthe HDB upgrading scheme essentially directed at persons who have who are\nliving in HDB flats who therefore need the subsidies which government grants\nvia the HDB flat scheme\n\n\nWithout the upgrading process it's it it's likely that many HDB\nhouse owners will not have the resources to upgrade some of the older flats\nboth internally and externally and some of them are quite old and we have\nareas of significant urban decay which is undesirable and the government's\nprogram is to correct several things at the same time\n\n\nOne is to upgrade the quality of the urban housing in HDB estates\nand secondly to provide help to HDB residents to increase their asset values\n\n\nWhether such programs can be applied to private residential housing\nis something which I think we need to consider very carefully because the\ngeneral assumption is that people who live in bungalows or private housing\nare usually better off financially and therefore ownership of landed\nproperties cannot justify government's help or subsidies in any form other\nthan the beautification greening attempt we we made some years ago\n\n\nHowever if Mr Heng can let me know the type of houses he has in\nmind in his constituency which are in such a bad state of repair where the\nresidents are so poor that some form of is necessary well I'm sure we would\nbe happy to consider\n\n<$B> \n\nMr Heng\n\n<$D> \n\nSir in view of the rather positive answers given by the\nMinister I'm very Glad to withdraw my cut\n\n<$B> \n\nMember given leave to withdraw his amendment\n\n\nYes withdrawn", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nMr Chiam\n\n<$B> \n\nThank you Sir for allowing me to speak\n\n\nSir I'm heartened to hear that the recruitment of teachers have\nimproved uh to over a thousand last year\n\n\nBut the Minister uh perhaps could also enlighten us as to the\nattrition rate or the drop out rate of teachers from the from their jobs\n\n\nNow I'm always concerned in fact every year I bring up this subject\nof shortage of teachers in our secondary and primary schools\n\n\nUh when there are not enough teachers to go around the\nteacher-student ratio will naturally be low\n\n\nHow I complain of this many times in this House of the class size in\nnearly all government and government-aided schools\n\n\nUh these class size are too large when they are between forty to\nforty three and uh pupils in such a class uh can never get effective teaching\nin particular in these days when the work load imposed on our school children\nis so heavy\n\n\nThe teachers are given very wide syllabus to cover and they have to\ngo very quickly through them and of course the average uh pupils uh would\nfind it very difficult to cope up\n\n\nUh they then they do not do so well in their examinations and their\nparents get very worried\n\n\nWorking mothers are left in a dilemma whether to continue working\nor to stay at home stop work and help their children out in their studies\n\n\nIn the past uh normally only those who can afford will employ\nprivate tutors to coach their children\n\n\nbut in these days when academic qualifications are so important to\nget good jobs even those parents who really cannot afford to have uh tutors\nuh tighten their belts make sacrifices and save money to employ tutors to\nhelp out their children in their studies\n\n\nSo of course this will cause uh greater financial burden on these\nparents\n\n\nNow and the government wants to encourage learning of mother\ntongues in our schools that is something which I support\n\n\nNow but the teaching of the standard of teaching of mother tongue\nhave been dropping in our schools\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nBecause there is an acute shortage of teachers and they are too\nmany pupils in the class\n\n\nuh the shortage of teachers is a very basic fundamental flaw in our\nschools\n\n\nUh the government says that it's trying hard to solve this uh\nproblem\n\n\nuh in fact I think the government has no choice\n\n\nThe government should uh sort sort this very uh basic fundamental\nbasic uh educational uh problem\n\n\nOtherwise all the talk about Edusave and the full day schools will\nbe of little use\n\n\nNow last year the Institute of Edu uh last year the Minister said\nthat the Institute of Education is not producing enough teachers\n\n\nuh well I know the Minister is doing everything it can but I hope\nthis will not be seen as an excuse\n\n\nThank you\n\n<$A> \n\nMr Low\n\n\nYou you wanted to speak\n\n\nNo\n\n<$C> \n\nIt's under uh Head L right\n\n\nNo just now I want to seek some clarification from the Minister\n\n<$A> \n\nYes you want to seek your clarification\n\n<$C> \n\nUh what is the turnover uh rate of teachers in the uh uh of\nour of the Ministry of Education\n\n<$A> \n\nDr Tan\n\n<$D> \n\nSir just want to seek a clarification from the Senior Minister\nof State\n\n\nI know there is this policy of not accepting graduates who do not\nhave two teaching subjects as uh teachers\n\n\nI was wondering whether the Ministry has would like to review this\npolicy because there are I'm sure\n\n\nthere are some uh graduates who may not have two teaching subjects\nfor example a graduate in nus history and politics\n\n\nWould they consider would the Ministry consider accepting such uh\ngraduates as teachers\n\n\nThank you\n\n<$A> \n\nDr Tay\n\n<$E> \n\nSir uh turn first to the point made by uh Mr Chiam\n\n\nUh I've already spoken quite uh extensively about the uh\nrecruitment of teachers to try to meet the shortage situation so I will not\nrepeat myself\n\n\nUhm his point about class size uh is something that he brings up\nalmost every year uh predictably\n\n\nMr Chiam has the opinion that uh to have good education you must\nkeep your class sizes small the smaller the better\n\n\nUh I don't know where he has obtained this uh information from\n\n\nI suspect he has obtained it from his western contacts because it\nis true in uh UK United States they uh one of the key points that had been\nmade by many people is they must keep class sizes small the smaller the\nbetter twenty five twenty per class\n\n\nBut but does Mr Chiam that in these two countries in UK and US\nthere is a great deal of unhappiness about education\n\n\nIn fact there's a lot of criticism about the dropping standards of\neducation in these two countries\n\n\nand this is a subject which will affect the elections in Britain in\nApril and possibly the American elect Presidential election in November\n\n\nSo I don't think uh he should just simply uh quote or ape something\nwhich has been uh widely touted in another place and say that this is a\nsolution for Singapore\n\n\nIt is much more I think this class size issue is over-rated\n\n\nIf you look at Japan Korea Taiwan their class sizes are bigger than\nours On a regular basis it's between forty five and fifty per class and I\nremember visiting a very good school in Seoul Korea\n\n\nTheir class sizes were sixty per class\n\n\nThey managed to do quite well\n\n\nTheir their students in fact excel and are held up by the American\neducationists as examples of students who are doing so well and of a system\nthat is far better than theirs\n\n\nI think we should see these things in balance\n\n\nWe have a class size of about thirty six and it varies from year to\nyear depending on the uh the number of classes that are created\n\n\nIt has served us well\n\n\nI don't think there has been any uh worry that because of the class\nsize of thirty six you know our school results are suffering\n\n\nIn fact each year to the amazement of many people the results seem\nto be improving\n\n\nThis year's 'O' level results and 'A' level results have been the\nbest ever\n\n\nI think what is more important I'm ya are you dealing\n\n<$C> \n\nI don't believe that the class size has nothing to do with the\nquality of education\n\n<$E> \n\nYou don't believe it\n\n<$C> \n\nbecause because if you have a smaller size of class the\nteacher will have more attention pay more attention and more time to cater\nfor individual students\n\n<$E> \n\nIt's it isn't as simple as that my friend\n\n\nI was going to come with this next point\n\n\nWhat are what are the key factors for success in school\n\n\nSince the Mr Chiam Mr Low are very concerned about this\n\n\nWhat are the key factors of success in school\n\n\nI think first the basic ability of the child is very important The\nchild is endowed with certain abilities that is very basic and important\n\n\nSecondly the motivation of the child is important also\n\n\nThe child may be very bright in terms of his endowment if he is\nunmotivated he will not do well he will not pay attention to his studies\n\n\nSo motivation is important\n\n\nWhat are the what are the avenues of motivating the child\n\n\nThe school is definitely an important avenue and that's why I said\nthat the principal and his team of teachers are really the core the heart of\nthe school\n\n\nBy doing a good job in running the school they are motivating the\nchildren under their charge concentrate on their lessons to do well in their\nECA to do all kinds of things they want them to do\n\n\nBut beyond the school motivation by parents is perhaps even more\nimportant\n\n\nLet me explain why I say this\n\n\nI've just come across a study\n\n\nThis is a study of children of Vietnamese refugees who are studying\nin American schools in California\n\n\nTo the amazement of everybody these children who speak hardly any\nEnglish when they start school are doing very well in their schools in their\nneighbourhood schools compared with American children who are not doing well\nat all in the schools\n\n\nSo studies have been done in this\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nThe same school different children\n\n\nOne does well one doesn't do very well\n\n\nThere must be some other reason\n\n\nThe reason is outside the school\n\n\nThey found in their studies that the Vietnamese parents of these\nchildren pay a great deal of attention toward their children\n\n\nThey may not be highly educated themselves Many of them are in fact\nnot rich at all\n\n\nThey are refugees but they pay attention to what their children do\n\n\nthey encourage them they supervise them where they can and as a\nresult of that kind of encouragement the children concentrate on their work\nand they do well in the American system\n\n\nNow what is true of the Vietnamese children is also true of\nchildren in Singapore and anywhere else in the world\n\n\nIf there is parental interest if there's warmth and encouraging\nsupport from parents even if the parents are not rich even if the parents do\nnot have a high education but they are interested in what their children are\ndoing the children will do better in school\n\n\nThat has been proven again and again from many studies\n\n<$C> \n\nIs the Minister implying that those students who are not doing\nwell or their parents are not interested\n\n<$A> \n\nMr Low in future if you have\n\n<$C> \n\nOh sorry\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> to raise could you please ask for\nmy permission first\n\n\nall right\n\n<$E> \n\nI think the member should take the whole thing in context not\njust pick on one point\n\n\nOn the other hand it is true that there are parents who\nunfortunately are very nervous about their children's education\n\n\nuh they are negative in the way they deal with their children\n\n\nI think this discourages the children\n\n\nIt shakes up their self-confidence and in fact the children do\nworse\n\n\nSo my advice to parents is to take a positive attitude to be very\nencouraging and not to use the opposite which is to scold them to criticise\nthem and to compare them with other children and say why is it your you can't\ndo better than them\n\n\nI think this discourages the child\n\n\nThe reason may be to help them to do better but the result is the\nopposite\n\n\nOn a subject of turnover of teachers in our schools\n\n\nuhm in fact the turnover rate in our schools is not high\n\n\nUh we have a turnover rate of staff of about two to three percent\na year\n\n\nNow if you compare that with the turnover in many other industrial\nin uh economic sectors I think the turnover rate of teachers is quite low\n\n\nUh Dr Tan Cheng Bock has asked the question about graduate\nteachers or graduates who have who do not have two teaching subjects\n\n\nUh I think I have to refer this to the uh Public Service\nCommission or the Education Service Commission because they are responsible\nfor the recruitment of teachers\n\n\nuh and they also lay down the rules on what is minimum requirement\n\n\nBut the reason why two teaching subjects have been put in for\ngraduates is because most teachers can be expected to teach two subjects not\njust one\n\n\nSo it's quite necessary for them to have two teaching subjects\n\n<$A> \n\nYes Mr Chiam\n\n<$B> \n\nSir can I just one ask one question\n\n\nSir\n\n<$B> \n\nNow I thought you have finished\n\n\nCan I ask one question\n\n<$A> \n\nGo ahead Mr Chiam\n\n\nGo ahead\n\n<$B> \n\nJust one one one question only\n\n<$A> \n\nYes go ahead\n\n<$B> \n\nUh I would ask the Minister assuming that the school under\nall conditions are similar and in one school you have got a class size of\ntwenty five another school with a class size of sixty which school would you\nsend your child to \n\n<$F> \n\nUh may I just uh supplement uh what uh my Minister of State\nSenior Minister of State has said uhm answer to Mr Chiam's question I\nunderstand it's his favourite question and it's uh something worth debating\nNow in in looking at the education system we have a tendency in Singapore to\nlook towards the west US UK and so on and some of the opposition leaders uh\nmembers might have been teachers before so they had certain philosophies\nbuilt into them If you have been following the press uh in UK for example\nrecently they have come up with a new study you know the Education\nSecretaries' come up with new study to show that in fact they were for many\nyears for generations influenced so much by this so-called Powden Report\nwhich says you should never teach a child you should let him discover by\nhimself you know you should not even have prop uh uh structured learning and\nso on As a result of this the education system in UK has been blighted for\ngenerations and now they're trying to recover So you must see this in\nperspective if you want to study and try and improve the education system We\nmust also compare the situation in nuh Japan the situation in nuh Korea\nTaiwan and so on And as a let me finish first let me finish first as has been\nmentioned by uh Dr Tay in fact the class size in Japan and Taiwan are forty\nfifty and even above In Singapore's case our class size standard size is\nforty Some schools have less In fact the average figure for secondary schools\nis about thirty six pupils per class Now those schools that are less popular\ntend to have smaller classes the popular ones tend to have big classes\nsometimes as big as forty four and the results are better uh So it is not so\nmuch the class size alone Let's not over-emphasise this point If you want to\nuh reduce class size for example you go from forty to twenty as uh advocated\nby Mr Chiam you will have to increase number of teachers by two Instead of\ntwenty thousand teachers you need to have forty thousand teachers Where do we\nfind the number of teachers And what is the value of so doing I mean if you\nteach in front of a class of uh twenty or class of forty what's the\ndifference You're teaching right Of course if you want to have a interactive\nmethod then it's better to have a smaller class size But you must remember\nthat sometimes when you interact with the pupils in fact you may be spending\nmore time with one pupil at the expense of the whole class and that is the\nproblem that's been discovered in the western system The problem also with\nthe western system is that the children tend to be very undisciplined While\nthe teacher is teaching the class would be you know playing basketball behind\nor something Our situation is very different Our pupils are very disciplined\nand they want to learn and their parents want them to learn So we've\ndiscovered that in fact with a class size of forty we are doing very well and\nwe should be proud of the results that we've achieving year after year I\nthink we compare very well with international standards and personally I'm\namazed at number of students who score straight As in 'O' levels uh 'A'\nlevels and so on", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nH J Ministry of Community Development Amendment number one\n\n\nWe have twenty five minutes Mr Abdullah Tarmugi\n\n<$B> \n\nSir I beg to move that the total sum to be allocated for H J of\nthe main estimates be reduced by one hundred dollars\n\n\nMr Chairman Sir in any country there will be families and\nindividuals whose standard of living fall below others because of their low\nincomes\n\n\nIn Singapore Sir we do not see the crippling poverty that exists in\nsome countries\n\n\nIn slums in the streets begging hustling others\n\n\nOurs is more subtle but it nevertheless lurks behind the doors of\nour rented flats\n\n\nOfficial estimates put the number of low income families at thirty\neight thousand\n\n\nThis is defined as those families whose incomes fall below the\nminimum household expenditure level of about five hundred eleven dollars for\nthe family of four people\n\n\nSome of these families Sir are further disadvantaged by chronic and\nmultiple problems in the family thus putting the children at risk\n\n\nChildren Sir are inevitably caught in the poverty of their\nenvironments not only economically but also emotionally and socially\n\n\nThese families need our help\n\n\nThat question is who is to help them\n\n\nMy TPC Sir states categorically that we do not subscribe to welfare\nstate model as found in many countries in the west\n\n\nApart from the government the community and the families themselves\nwill have to work in concert to address the problems of low income families\n\n\nBut still we believe that government will have to play a leading\nrole in setting the tone of this tripartite co-operation in setting the\nrules in providing the basic infrastructure and in creating the atmosphere\nwhere the community will be motivated to help the families to be motivated\nand the families themselves to improve\n\n\nIn this context Sir let me touch on the question of subsidies\n\n\nThe GPC goes along with the government that mindless injections of\nsubsidies into welfare or those which merely finance consumption should not\nbe encouraged not entertained\n\n\nBut Sir subsidies which seek to improve those who receive them into\nbecoming more self-reliant and more independent should not be ruled out\naltogether\n\n\nIndeed government should not shy at granting subsidies which aim at\nthese objectives\n\n\nThey are needed and they are they also serve as an encouragement to\nothers in the community to come forward and help\n\n\nCan the Minister therefore elaborate in this House the government's\napproach to social welfare and to helping the needy in our midst\n\n\nWhat kinds of assistance is it prepared to render to those families\nand how is it encouraging VWOs or Voluntary Welfare Organizations and the\ncommunity\n\n\nSir I beg to move\n\n<$A> \n\nQuestion is that the total sum to be allocated for H J of the\nmain estimates to be reduced by one hundred dollars Mr Das\n\n<$C> \n\nMr Chairman Sir\n\n\nI've two cuts\n\n\nCan I take them\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$C> \n\nMr Chairman Sir as for my first cut I will just direct one\nquestion to the Minister that is what is the government doing to enhance\nsports performance in general\n\n\nAnd in particular with the forthcoming South-east Asian Games to be\nstaged in Singapore nineteen ninety three\n\n\nAre there any special programs to improve our haul of golds during\nthese game\n\n\nSir I move on to my next cut which is which is recognition for\nnational sportsmen\n\n\nMr Chairman Sir Singapore has in the fifties and sixties produced\nworld class sportsmen\n\n\nTo name a few well like Wong Peng Soon in badminton Ong Poh Lin\nbadminton Ismail Maja badminton Tan Ow Liang weightlifting Neo Choo Kok\nswimming\n\n\nIn the eighties and nineties one world class sportsman which we\nhave produced possibly Mr Ang Peng Siong\n\n\nAnd uh no other name comes to my mind\n\n\nWhy is this so\n\n\nEspecially when we have better facilities better and more modern\nfacilities now than in the fifties and sixties\n\n\nThe reason I believe may be Sir that sports or talent in sports is\nnot given its due recognition in Singapore\n\n\nSportsmen give their best part of their career or age say from\nsixteen or in the case of swimmers even younger go up to sixteen to twenty\nfour\n\n\nand then they fade away with no guarantee of a secure livelihood\n\n\nand there are of course other pressures\n\n\nOther talent be it academic arts I believe has been looked after\nreasonably well and this is not the case for sports\n\n\nSir if we want our standard to improve then I believe something\nshould be done\n\n\nNot everything should be done by the government but I believe\ngovernment can lead the way and this can be strongly followed by the private\nsector\n\n\nSir when Ang Peng Siong wins a gold medal it brings joy and pride\nto all Singaporeans especially when the Majulah Singapura is played\n\n\nWhen Fandi scores a goal fifty thousand Singaporeans roar in\necstasy\n\n\nFor all these what do they get\n\n\nAng Peng Siong now works in a club and advertises for Fab\n\n\nSir I think the best of our sportsmen with talent must be nurtured\nand looked up\n\n\nSomething is being done for our footballers right now\n\n\nand I think the FAS should be congratulated\n\n\nand I think more will be done in the near future\n\n\nSir government particularly the Ministry of Defence together with\nprivate sector companies could help to nurture our talent in sports by\nguaranteed guaranteeing them a certain amount of livelihood\n\n\nand at the same time allowing them to continue to excel in the\nsports of their choice\n\n\nI hope Sir the Ministry of Community Development and the real\nMinister for Sports to look into this aspect\n\n\nThank you\n\n<$A> \n\nMr Singh\n\n<$D> \n\nMr Chairman Sir\n\n\nI would like to support everything that Mr Chandra Das has said\n\n\nSir for some reason we do not do very well in sports when we\ncompete internationally\n\n\nI can understand that for a long time now we have been motivated by\na need to succeed economically and that's laudable\n\n\nBut we don't really have to compromise on that principle or\nobjective\n\n\nThere there is a group of people in Singapore very athletically\ninclined and who for some reason are not inclined towards studies\n\n\nand then don't make it to the university or other tertiary\ninstitutions\n\n\nIf we don't give them incentives they're not likely to continue to\nplay the games that they excel in with the result that they don't do well in\nlife either in seeking a job\n\n\nand they don't exploit their sporting talents to the maximum\n\n\nNow then you therefore what you have is this group of people who\nare who don't do well in life and at the same time Singapore loses out on\nthis pool of talent\n\n\nWe've done economically we have concentrated on the arts\n\n\nWe have need reaching for other ideals now\n\n\nI would urge the government to pay more attention to sports not\nonly because the SEA Games is around the corner but because sports has a\nunique way of bringing people together\n\n\nI've said this before\n\n\nWe can do so much better in getting Singaporeans to be passionate\nabout our own country than by National Day events or by Orchard Road Swings\nbig parties that we have\n\n\nThese events are contrived to get Singaporeans together and to feel\nsomething for the country\n\n\nBut there is a there is a way we can do this without having to\nspend millions of dollars\n\n\nAnd this is by encouraging our best sportsmen\n\n\nThose who are not inclined to pursue a career or to to take their\nstudies further to concentrate their talents where they have them on the\nfield\n\n\nFor example football\n\n\nmy colleague has said fifty thousand people are cheering\n\n\nNo doubt a lot of them have other motivations\n\n\nThey've got money on the game perhaps\n\n\nBut there is this other group\n\n\nA huge majority who derive including me a tremendous amount of\nsatisfaction and pleasure when we win\n\n\nand when you cheer you're cheering for Singapore and everybody\nidentifies with the country for once\n\n\nThere is a lot to be said about government taking the lead in\nsetting aside a few jobs for the athletically inclined so that they can\nattend to their jobs from nine a.m. to three p.m. and then get out to the\nfields and concentrate on their sporting talents\n\n\nBuild a great team in soccer in any other sport and get out there\nand compete internationally\n\n\nAnd if the government takes the lead the private sector will follow\n\n\nIf we don't do that we'll never get anywhere in sports\n\n\nSport is a unifying force we should concentrate on it\n\n\nThank you Sir\n\n<$A> \n\nYeo\n\n<$E> \n\nThank you Mr Speaker\n\n\nSir first of all I'd like to thank my uh three colleagues who've\nspoken up on the first cut\n\n\nSir Mr Tarmugi has asked about what is the government's approach to\nthose in need\n\n\nHe has stated very clearly that the GPC does not subscribe to a\nwelfare state\n\n\nThat the members do not subscribe to just throwing money at the\nsituation\n\n\nSir the government's approach to social welfare is the many helping\nhands approach involving a partnership between government and the various\ncivic community and welfare organizations\n\n\nSir social welfare issues are difficult issues to deal with in any\nsociety\n\n\nLong term vision and perseverance are necessary and it require a\npainstaking effort\n\n\nAnd the results only show up many years later\n\n\nSimilarly welfare assistance programs which go wrong are very\ndifficult to unravel\n\n\nWe've seen many countries in which this has happened\n\n\nThey started off with very good intentions but end up only\naggravating the problems instead of solving them\n\n\nFor example many countries have unemployment benefits\n\n\nVery generous ones to help those who are temporarily unemployed\n\n\nWhat happened is that all these programs instead ended up\nencouraging people to stay unemployed\n\n\nIn America the welfare programs started off also with very good\nintentions with very manageable budgets\n\n\nToday social security and welfare is the largest single item in\nthe US federal budget taking up more than one third its budget\n\n\nWe therefore are on good grounds in being very careful\n\n\nSir our focus in our social welfare programs is to help the needy\nget back on their own two feet\n\n\nTax payers' money goes only into programs which are designed to\nmotivate and help them to become independent rather than to dampen their\ndrive to be independent\n\n\nSir our experience shows that giving money for example through our\nrents and utilities uh scheme alone is not adequate\n\n\nWe had let me quote a case\n\n\nWe had a case of a thirty eighty thirty eight year old divorced\nlady with two schooling children who are temporarily on the rents rent and\nutilities assistance scheme for six months\n\n\nShe was first working as a night-shift uh worker because she\nthought that that way she can help look after her children in the day-time\n\n\nBut she was not earning enough money\n\n\nAnd also because after working late at night she's really too\ntired in day-time to help to look after the children\n\n\nSo she left and got a part-time job as a cleaner\n\n\nIt paid even less\n\n\nAs a result she was in arrears in her uh PUB bills and in her HDB\nrental payments\n\n\nSo HDB referred her case to the Council of Social Services which\nadministers the RUAS scheme the Rent and Utilities Assistance scheme\n\n\nVouchers were then given to her to help her tide over pay her\nfinancial difficulties\n\n\nBut over and above that a social worker from the Asian Women's\nwelfare association helped her to look for another job which paid her more\nand at the same time helped her to spend more time with her children\n\n\nShe was given counselling on how to budget how to manage her time\n\n\nand the association also arranged tuition for her son\n\n\nAs a result she managed to manage her financial her funds better\n\n\nand uh she requested to take off to be taken off the RAUS scheme\nafter six months \n\n\nSo the the aim of our program is to help them cope with the\ndemands of everyday living which means how to earn how to how to find a job\nhow to manage the funds how to save for rainy day and very important how to\nhelp your children Sir helping the needy is most effective when it's done at\nthe local and the community level This is because community organizations\nhave the flexibility to provide the individual individual ? attention which\nis very necessary when helping the very wide spectrum of people who are\ninvolved Government departments cannot do that This way with the help of\nvoluntary organizations we have a better chance to help the needy to level up\nbecause we can tap on a much wider spectrum of resources Sir we therefore\nappeal to more civic community and religious groups as well as corporate\ncitizens and corporate and uh sorry individuals to come forward to volunteer\ntheir time effort and resources There're different outreach and broader\noutreach would enable us to provide a more comprehensive uh scheme and more\ncomprehensive range of assistance to uh those who are in need of help Sir on\nthe part of the government we will support and enhance this community bonds\nand the network of social services What we can do is that we will fund the\nwelfare organizations by providing eighty percent of the funds required for\nthe capital investments and we would also provide fifty percent of the\nrecurrent cost incurred by them and for this purpose we have set aside\nseventy five million dollars over the next three years to finance the eighty\npercent of the construction costs of new welfare facilities and the support\nfor the recurrent costs would cost us sixty three million dollars over the\nnext three years and in the pipe in the planning pipeline we have children's\nhomes sheltered workshops day activities centres for the disabled family\nservice centres and homes for the aged Sir our social welfare efforts go\nbeyond providing the financial support to the to the needy We must go beyond\nthat to enhance and expand the network of welfare and community volunteers\nThis way we can then effectively assist the needy to break out of their\nunfortunate situation", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nMr Chairman Sir\n\n\nIn Singapore we do not really know the extent of the population that\nhave disabilities\n\n\nUsing an estimate of three point eight percent used by Asian\ncountries such as Hong Kong and Japan there are about ninety seven thousand\ndisabled people in Singapore\n\n\nThe services for disabled people provided by the voluntary welfare\norganizations cater only for about eight thousand disabled people\n\n\nThe question is are we doing enough\n\n\nThere are four areas which I would like to touch on\n\n\nFirstly a national registry of disabled persons\n\n\nDespite the shortcomings of the previous central registry of\ndisabled persons I believe that the ministry should set up a national\nregistry of disabled persons\n\n\nFor this registry to succeed the referral process must be made\nsimple and the referral sources identified\n\n\nSources of referrals should include hospitals school health\nservices maternal and child health clinics polyclinics and schools\n\n\nWithout a proper database it will be difficult to project manpower\nneeds and plan for infra-structural needs\n\n\nBy making the referral process easy and by increasing public\nawareness of the registry the government will be able to get a better\napproximation of the incidence of disabled persons and the different\ndisabilities involved\n\n\nThis will be extremely useful for future planning\n\n\nSecondly educational and training programs\n\n\nCurrently there are insufficient special schools\n\n\nThe vocational training in sheltered workshop programs are limited\nand there's a shortage of trained staff\n\n\nWhat plans do the ministry have in overcoming these shortcomings\n\n\nThirdly national coordinating centre for the disabled\n\n\nThe ministry should work with the Singapore Council of Social\nServices in setting up a coordinating centre for the disabled which will\nemploy full-time staff\n\n\nThe centre will maintain the registry coordinate the activities of\nall government and voluntary associations providing for the disabled and plan\nfor future infra-structural needs\n\n\nLastly activities of daily living\n\n\nTo facilitate the disabled in their integration\n\n\nI'm heartened that in many places the buildings have been designed\nto cater for the needs of those who are disabled\n\n\nWe can do more for example MCD should coordinate with the HDB to\nhelp disabled persons who apply for HDB flats to obtain flats that are at\nthat\n\n\nTo obtain flats that are at the ground floor or at the same level\nas the lift\n\n\nWe must do more for fellow Singaporeans who are disabled\n\n\nWhat plans do the ministry have in facilitating the disabled in\ntheir activities of daily living\n\n\nSir I would like to know the minister's views in these areas\n\n<$B> \n\nMr Yeo\n\n<$C> \n\nThank you Mr Speaker Sir\n\n\nSir both Mr Abdullah Tarmugi and uh Dr Michael Lim have raised\nquestions on the disabled\n\n\nSir the government's policy towards the uh disabled is to help them\nto live independently so as in order\n\n\nsorry is to enable them to live independently as far as it's\ncompatible with their capabilities\n\n\nThis would enable them to look after themselves as to lessen the\nburden on the family\n\n\nSir the uh House should recall that in nineteen eighty eight an\nadvisory council on the disabled was formed to recommend uh ways to help the\ndisabled and to help them to integrate into society\n\n\nThe council's recommendations covered a wide spectrum of issues\naffecting the disabled such as prevention of disability special education\naccessibility and transportation social services and institutional care\n\n\nSir twenty six of the recommendations were adopted by the\ngovernment for for implementation and these are now in the various stages of\nimplementation\n\n\nAnd would be of great help to disabled to the uh disabled\n\n\nSir historically the voluntary sector has been in the forefront of\nprovision of services for the disabled\n\n\nThey have done extremely well and should be con should be\nencouraged to continue to do so\n\n\nWe will assist them as far as possible to provide improved and\nexpanded ah programs\n\n\nNow through the concerted efforts of both government and the VWOs a\nwide range of services and facilities have already been implemented\n\n\nThis include special education vocational training and\nrehabilitation vocational assessment and job placement production at\nsheltered workshops day-care hostels and residential care\n\n\nMr Tarmugi has asked in terms of what are we providing to the uh to\nthe disabled\n\n\nSir we've set aside about twenty two million dollars as capital\ngrants for the further development and upgrading of facilities for the\ndisabled for the period nineteen ninety to nineteen ninety four\n\n\nTwenty two million dollars over the over the five years\n\n\nAnd we will also support these VWOs in their recurrent expenditures\nas such funding would amount to forty seven million dollars over the next\nthree years\n\n\nSir we would be helping the VWOs to establish two more residential\nhomes for the disabled one production workshop one sheltered workshop two\nday-activities centres one hostel and two multi-service centres\n\n\nSome of these are already in the process of development\n\n\nSir in terms of the uh special education\n\n\nFor example they are already currently thirteen special education\nschools with enrolment of about two thousand five hundred children\n\n\nand uh the government provides a grant of four thousand six hundred\ndollars per student which is twice the cost of the regular primary school\neducation program\n\n\nSir Dr Michael Lim has asked some other specific uh questions also\n\n\nHe has asked that the sources that are in terms of having a\nreferral service for the disabled\n\n\nand that we need to set up a uh centralized referral system and\nregistry\n\n\nand that such the cen such a centre can then be a co-ordinating\ncentre for the disabled\n\n\nSir at the present moment there's a very loose arrangement for\nreferring disabled people for help\n\n\nFor example there are referrals uh systems whereby disabled are\nthen referred either to the VWOs that are involved in helping the disabled\n\n\nor they're referred to the various centres for the aged sick like\nfor example the uh Home Nursing Foundation has a senior citizens day-care\ncentres that also help the disabled recover from strokes for example\n\n\nUh we also have community day uh based day-care centres which help\nwhich uh provide help to such disabled\n\n\nSir the Council of Social Services will be undergoing some changes\nin the future and they would specific committees to focus attention on\ndifferent groups of people that require help\n\n\nSo they will have a committee which will focus strictly on the\ndisabled\n\n\nand this group will then be able to study into what are the best\nways to reach out to the uh to the disabled and what sort of help to provide\nto such people\n\n\nSo I think with the setting of this unit in the uh council uh in\nthe near future would be able to have a more effective method for compiling\nsuch data\n\n\nSir the in terms of training programs there are training programs\navailable for the disabled already\n\n\nFor example uh VITB already conducts training programs and uh\nhundred and three disabled people have been able to take part in the uh\nregular VITB programs\n\n\nFor those unable to take part in the VITB programs the uh VWOs do\nhave training programs of their own\n\n\nFor example the vocational school for the handicapped uh offers\ntraining programs\n\n\nand uh there're also uh sheltered workshops offering skills\ntraining as well as pre-employment training\n\n\nThe Singapore Council of So Social Service has also set up a centre\ncalled the Bees Link Centre which has a centralized vocational assessment\nservice as well as a job placement centre\n\n\nThe uh the Bees Link Centre also operates a production workshop\nemploying disabled people who have potential but who face some difficulties\nin getting jobs for the time being\n\n\nSo there are enough training uh places available\n\n\nIn terms of uh of the number of workshops there'll be more that'll\nbe set up\n\n\nSir he's also talked about barriers to the disabled physical as\nwell as emotional barriers\n\n\nSir the government together with the VWOs have been conducting\neducational programs and public awareness programs to raise the awareness of\nboth the public\n\n\nand more importantly employers in terms of providing in terms of\nbeing more sympathetic to the uh to the disabled and to offer them employment\n\n\nThe point specifically brought up by Mr Tarmugi that what the\ndisabled are looking for are opportunities not just sympathy\n\n\nSo a there're various programs that are available to help the\nemployment in employment of disabled people\n\n\nThe Bees Link Centre as I mentioned has the uh job placement centre\n\n\nThe centre has already placed out two hundred and twenty seven uh\ndisabled people in uh various companies\n\n\nThere're also other schemes for example uh the there's a scheme\nwhereby employers who are taking in disabled people are helped through a\nsubsidy that's provided by uh that's provided by the Singapore Chinese\nChamber of Commerce and Industry\n\n\nUnder this scheme employers who employ disabled ah can have the\nfirst one and a half months salary of the disabled paid through a fund which\nis provided by the Chamber\n\n\nUh so this this way it allows the employers who are who have never\nhad the experience of employing disabled to take in disabled for a trial\nperiod\n\n\nAnd they're assured that for the first one and a half months the\nsalaries are borne by this fund\n\n\nWe also provide tax incentives to employers who make work site\nmodifications in order to accommodate the uh disabled\n\n\nSo in terms of direct help to employers in terms of providing\ntraining for the disabled and in terms of providing a placement service all\nthese are already there\n\n\nAnd uh I'm sure the VWOs will be looking into more ways of\nenhancing such programs in the future\n\n\nIn terms of physical barriers Sir\n\n\nThe government does advocate a barrier-free environment uh within\nthe community for the uh disabled and the aged\n\n\nThis led to the government incorporating the accessibility code\ninto the building control regulations in February nineteen ninety in order to\npromote a barrier-free environment\n\n\nThe government also formed a coordin coordinating committee to\nprovide a comprehensive barrier-free environment under the Ministry of\nNational Development\n\n\nI think members would have noticed some of the uh decisions and\nprograms which have been implemented as a result of this uh policy\n\n\nYou've seen the public walkways in the city for example are being\nmodified so that ramps are provided allowing our handicapped to get on to the\nwalkways without having to uh move up the uh the step\n\n\nUh now he has also mentioned about HDB flats Sir HDB has also been\nvery supportive\n\n\nThe HDB has already formulated guidelines on uh incorporating\nbarrier-free features in its in its estates\n\n\nThe new HDB blocks in the future will have uh provision wherever\npossible for improved linkages with adjoining blocks\n\n\nThere're also there'll be also more blocks where you have lift\nopening on every floor\n\n\nUh the lift lobbies would have ramps to facilitate movement of\nwheelchairs and the lift size would be wide enough for the wheelchair\n\n\nSo this this would help disabled who are are moving around in\nwheelchairs\n\n\nSir HDB has also uh made provisions which meets what the member\nhas asked for\n\n\nThat is an applicant or a family member who is medically or\nphysically handicapped will be able to uh be considered for priority\nallocation of a floor uh for a flat on a lower floor as well as a flat on the\nlift landing floor\n\n\nSo this has already been uh incorp been uh implemented already\n\n\nSir so I think in due course the disabled will find that moving\naround would be a lot easier than compared to let's say five years ago when\nuh more ramps are available and more uh of the barriers are are removed\n\n\nI think I've I've replied to most of his points under the under\nthe disabled\n\n\nSir I move on to the aged population\n\n\nBoth Mr Tarmugi and Dr Michael Lim have also have spoken on the\naged \n\n\nSir the aged is an issue which should concern all of us that is\nbecause our aged population will increase very significantly Today only nine\npercent of our population are aged above sixty By the by the year twenty\nthirty about one in four of our population would be above the age of sixty\nand one there'll be one aged to two persons in the working age group of\nfifteen to sixteen So I think this is a problem which is of uh which will\nhave great significance uh and great and and uh many implications for society\nin Singapore Now what is heartening and important to note is that fortunately\nmost elderly are actually healthy Our studies show that about ninety three\npercent of elderly are fit active and healthy Only five percent are frail and\nabout two percent are bed-ridden Sir because of the large number of elderly\nthat we'll be having in the uh future the responsibility for caring for the\naged falls on all of us everyone the family the community the government and\nthe aged themselves Sir in lloking after the aged we must preserve the family\nas the best social insurance for its members because by the year twenty\ntwenty thirty even if we want to we won't be able to find enough economically\nactive people to lookj after the aged because the numbers the number of the\nuh aged will be so great Sir the family setting allows the aged to grow old\ngraciously in familiar surroundings and therefore help them to maintain their\nself-worth and dignity The our programs are therefore directed towards\nhelping them to live within the community Sir Mr Tarmugi has asked in terms\nof caring for the aged sick and poor what is the amount of health uh what are\nwe doing in terms of providing health facilities and uh in terms of helping\nus to meet the needs of the elderly what sort of institutional what sort what\nare we doing in terms of providing inti in uh insitutional care and in terms\nof helping them to live within the com the community Sir our programs which\nare aimed at helping the aged to live within the the uh families and the\ncommunity are aimed at promoting self-help or mutual help because for every\nfrail elderly there'll be at least twenty fit and healthy elderly So whilst\nwe have very few working people to help look after the elderly in the future\nwe must not forget we'll have a large number of very fit and healthy uh older\nperson who should then participate in helping to look after themselves Sir\nthe success of our programs to help the aged depends on uh how the public\nperceives and perceives the aged in the process of aging and how they accept\nthe aged I think there's a tendency to perceive the aged as being sickly\ndependent and decrepit We must change such an sttitude if we are going to be\nable to encourage more members of the public to come forward to participate\nin uh providing assistance to the uh to the elderly So what the gov the\ngovernment is doing is that we are having a annual public awareness and\npublic educaiton program on the aged in order to enhance the level of\nawareness of the population Now the highlight of this program is is our\nSenior Citizens' Day and uh I'm glad to say that the program has been quite\nsuccessful because the level of participation in our Senior Citizens' Day's\nprogram at both the national and the constituency level are have been\nincreasing Sir in terms of for the aged relief alone my family run uh my\nMinistry runs a befriender service scheme which helps to recruit volunteers\nand matches them to the Senior citizens The volunteers befriend advise and\nassist the aged to cope with their daily demands of living within the\ncommunity because it is important for us to encourage and to assist the\nelderly to live within the community and to only be uh obtaining\ninstitutional care as a matter of last reort In line with that we also have\nthe uh Home Nursing Foundation assisted by the Ministry of Health which\nprovides a home nursing service and trains members in the care of their aged\ndependents WE also provide uh screening and medical counselling in such\ncentres Sir the Singapore Action Group of Elders uh also has established a\nhot-line and counselling service for the aged and uh they are able to provide\nadvice counselling and referral uh services for the elderly who are who are\nwho require such services Mr Speaker: Mr Yeo we are running out of time on\nthis amendment Mr Yeo Cheow Tong: Okay Yes Sir Mr Speaker: You you Mr Yeo\nCheow Tong: Sir so in terms of helping them to live within the community we\nhave a lot of programs In terms of institutional care we will also be\nthere're there're already adequate nursing homes and uh other facilities uh\nwe will be helping the VWOs increase the number of uh places in the homes to\nmeet the requirements for the for the coming yeasr by funding eighty percent\nof the cost of these new facilities In terms of uh recurring expenses we will\nalso be helping them Sir we we will therefore be making sure that we have\nenough institutional uh facilities uh to to help look after those who require\ninstitutional care Sir let me move on to uh the issue of public assistance\nSir the public assistance scheme is meant to help the financially distressed\nto regain their independence It's not meant as an unemployment retirement or\ndisability allowance Sir we grant uh allowances to the aged destitues the\ndisabled and the chronically sick the orphans and the widows Sir the the\nscheme has to be stringent I know members are not very comfortable with or\nsome members are not comfortable with that but our scheme has to be stringent\nin order to encourage the able body to re to uh rely on themselves and not to\nrely on the dole Sir if we don't that don't do that then I think we 're\nheading down the slippery road to uh disaster On no one in Singapore is\ndenied the opportunity to apply for PA Sir but whilst we open the door for\nall to apply I think we must be careful to ensure that whilst we have a soft\nheart we don't have a soft head because as Dr Lim has mentioned some members\nin his constituencies feel shy about applying They feel that it's a shameful\nthing to do Sir I think it's not at all a bad emotion because if they are if\nthey feel that it is degrading to apply and therefore they re they are able\nto rely on their own other mechanisms as well as to rely on other\norganizations to help them I think it's a it's a very good thing We should Dr\nMichael Lim: Speaker Sir can I just clarify Well uh my point is that uh\nthey've actually applied and uh they have uh actually been interviewed and\nhave been accepted for the scheme but uh because of the following the\ninterview they felt that it was as if they were begging and therefore they\ndeclined their assistance and came to us for assistance but our assistance is\nlimited Mr Yeo: But they've gone ahead to apply and they have been\ninterviewed then why have they withdrawn the application Sir the the key\nthing is now the key thing is we want to be sure that only those who are\ngenuinely in need and who are unable to find other forms of assistance apply\nfor PA assistance That must be the basis and for those who have applied they\nwe must subject them to some interviewing to ensure these are the genuine\ncases I think there's no other way Sir for us to sort out the genuine from\nthe non-genuine But i can assure uh members that the interviews are done very\nprofessionally they're non-threatening they're in no way meant to embarrass\nthe applicants and also the data and information gathered are treated very\nconfidentially Sir when I'm when I uh went into MCD I made sure that all\nrejections were seen by me to ensure that the rejections were valid I'm glad\nto say that in all rejections in in all rejection cases while I was in MCD\nand before that the uh rejections were valid because the applicants really\nupon investigation were found that they have either adequate savings of their\nown or they were actually being supported by their families by their children\nrelatives So all the cases were rejected on good grounds Sir Mr Speaker: Mr\nYeo Mr Yeo: Sir but nonetheless Mr Speaker: Would you like to wind up your\nanswer Mr Yeo: Okay Sir what uh what we want to stress is that the PA scheme\nis adequate we do review the rates we do ensure that the the uh PA allowances\nare adequate to ensure that the PA recipients are able to survive and more\nmoreover more importantly we also on top of the PA scheme are able to draw on\nother resources to help the uh recipients Dr Michael LIm: Uh Speaker Sir can\nI just add one last statement Uh it appears it appears that my twenty nine\nyear old uh housewife with three children will not find solace in your answer\nuh perhaps uh Minister before he just ends would like to make a comment about\nthe proposal I made with regards to the widowed woman with the children Mr\nYeo: Sir I'm not familiar with his twenty nine year old uh widow the case of\nthe twenty nine year old widow if he feels that the the uh widow has got good\ngrounds he shoudl as MP write in to reappeal and I'm sure my my my ah offi\nofficials would uh reconsider In terms of his uh his suggestion that we we\nchannel the PA grants through the CCCs Sir I'm that in the first place that\nhis CCC uh was able to provide some help I think that's a right way to go The\nthe payment of the PA allowance through the POSB is a very convenient one It\nimposes no inconvenience on the recipients Mr Speaker: Mr Yeo I think you've\nanswered Mr Dr Lim already Mr Tarmugi Is member given leave to withdraw his\namendment Amendment withdrawn", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "96f9c54c-89e4-4a3f-932c-2915095f5a28", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.586129+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nAmendment number seven Mr Ho\n\n<$B> \n\nSir I beg that the sum allocated for Head R be reduced by ten\ndollars in respect of Code R fifteen hundred of the main estimates\n\n\nSir the arts and culture in Singapore is undergoing a renaissance\n\n\nThere is a long awaited and welcomed breath of fresh air\n\n\nThe National Arts Council has in a short six months been catalytic\nin in in initiating new activities and raising Singaporeans' awareness of the\narts to greater heights\n\n\nAll these augur well for Singapore for culture and the arts are\nwindows to the soul of a nation\n\n\nThey have a unifying effect a rallying call\n\n\nWhen we speak of enhancing the quality of life of Singaporeans an\navowed aim of the Next Lap\n\n\na development of the culture and arts is a vital component activity\n\n\nAs a university don I've long recognised the abundant creative\ntalent in Singaporeans particularly our youths\n\n\nI'm extremely pleased that this talent is increasingly becoming\nevident having the space to flower and bloom\n\n\nBut Sir what does all these mean for the average Singaporean our Mr\nor Miss HDB\n\n\nI feel that it is important that appreciation and enjoyment of the\narts is not seen as a prerogative of the well-off or educated\n\n\nIt must not become a divide among Singaporeans as golf once used to\nbe\n\n\nArts and culture should unite us not divide us\n\n\nI therefore like to ask the Minister what steps have been taken to\nmake enjoyment of the arts opened to all\n\n\nAlso wish to ask him three other questions\n\n\nFirstly what is the Ministry's position on culture and artistic\nofferings in the dialects\n\n\nI think we read in the papers of a certain uh group wanting to hold\na large-scale international Cantonese opera in Singapore\n\n\nand another and another group wanting to outdo the first group by\nholding a subsequent one on an even larger scale\n\n\nand a Teochew week has been held in Singapore\n\n\nThink these will increase so that some guidelines will be helpful\n\n\nA related question\n\n\nwhat is the Ministry's position on the screening of dialect\nprograms on subscription TV in the future\n\n\nSecondly what does the Minister see as future developments in the\ncultural and arts scene\n\n\nIn particular what is the role of the National Arts Council\n\n\nAnd thirdly in what ways can the business community professional\nassociations community groups and the people of Singapore in general give in\nterms of greater support in arts and culture\n\n\nThank you Sir\n\n<$A> \n\nQuestion is that the sum to be allocated for head R be reduced\nby ten dollars in respect of Code R fifteen hundred of the main estimates Mr\nChoo\n\n<$C> \n\nMr Chairman Sir in Mandarin\n\n<$A> \n\nMr Ho\n\n<$D> \n\nMr Chairman Sir let me first respond to the honourable member\nfor Sembawang GRC Mr Ho Peng Kee\n\n\nBut before I do that I wish to declare my interest\n\n\nI am an amateur artist\n\n\nAs an artist I definitely welcome what uh has said by the\nhonourable member for Sembawang GRC as well as the honourable member for uh\nJalan Besar GRC\n\n\nSir with the economic success over the years we can now afford to\ndivert our attention and channel a bigger chunk of our resources in the\npromotion of the arts\n\n\nSir in Singapore we are fortunate to be heirs to fine traditions\nfrom both the east and the west\n\n\nThese uh shape and enrich our culture and social life\n\n\nSir our multi-cultural heritage provides a good foundation for a\nSingapore identity\n\n\nOf course it will take time by many who are familiar with the local\nart scene\n\n\nThe evolution of such an identity is well underway\n\n\nThird with the formation of the National Arts Council under the\nable chairmanship of Professor Tommy Koh in September last year the promotion\nof artists given a fresh momentum\n\n\nWe can expect a more active art scene in the years to come\n\n\nHowever the National Art Council or NCA in short alone is not\nenough\n\n\nThe private sector and the arts community must also come forward to\nform a tripartite partnership in developing Singapore into a culturally\nvibrant city\n\n\nSir the member also asked about the work of NAC uh\n\n\nLet me briefly answer him\n\n\nSir since uh its inception in last September the NAC has\nsuccessfully completed a few major projects such as the traditional theatre\nfestival and the Singapore Dance festival\n\n\nSir the NAC has recently signed an agreement with the Scottish arts\ncouncil and the regional council to promote cultural exchanges between\nScotland and Singapore\n\n\nSingapore artists and art administrators will have a chance to\nvisit and other Scottish cities for training and study tours\n\n\nThis is in line with NAC's objective of linking with the\ninternational art community to cultural exchanges program with city noted for\nthe arts\n\n\nSir let me now list some of the programs and activities that AC\nwill implement over the next twelve months\n\n\nFestival of Arts to be held in June this year Singapore Art Fair in\nAugust also this year Cultural training with the Hong Kong Arts Festival\n\n\nThe establishment of an Art Endowment Fund new arts award schemes\n\n\nSir the NAC will also step up its effort to widen the audience\nspace as mentioned by the honourable just now\n\n\nIt will work with schools to promote interest in the arts among\nstudents\n\n\nAnd with mass organizations such as NTUC People's Association and\nthe Federation of Planned Association so that the general public will have a\ngreater access to art activities\n\n\nWe hope that with mass participation we will have a better chance\nof success in realizing our vision for nineteen ninety nine\n\n\nAs to the specific uh reference raised by the honourable member\n\n\nSir MITA will give uh equal treatment to all art groups and\norganizations\n\n\nAnd we provide necessary assistance to them whenever it's required\n\n\nSo if one of the group wants to call an international uh Cantonese\nopera and yet another group wants to hold another one\n\n\nWe'll we try our best to tell them its' to the best of their\ninterest to com combine or just have a a grand one because uh our audience\nspace is not big enough\n\n\nand if they go on with their projects well good luck to them\n\n\nOf course as far as MITA is concerned we'll like to give them\nwhatever is needed\n\n\nAs for the screen of uh dialect program on on TV I suppose I think\nit's the policy of the government that the dialects program uh should not be\nscreened over TV because uh it would jeopardize the effort made by the Speak\nMandarin Campaign over the years\n\n<$A> \n\nMr Ho we're running out of time We still have some amendments\n\n<$D> \n\nYes give me just uh one two minutes to uh reply\n\n<$A> \n\nI give you one minute\n\n<$D> \n\nWell well uh let me now turn to the honourable member from\nJalan Jalan Besar GRC\n\n\nWell uh let me first tell the member that in the business called\npromotional the arts\n\n\nEven if you have done a lot there is still a lot to be done\n\n\nBut I can assure the members that as well as the House that with\nthe formation of the National Arts Council greater emphasis will be given to\nassist local artists and art groups including the promotion overseas\n\n\nAs regard the proposal by Mr Choo to set up a cultural uh village\nuh I think it's a good idea\n\n\nI will ask my officer to look into the feasibility of such a\nproposal\n\n\nThank you\n\n<$A> \n\nMr Ho\n\n<$B> \n\nSir I thank the Senior for his comprehensive relpy and beg\nleave to withdraw the motion\n\n<$A> \n\nMember given leave to withdraw his amendment Amendments\nwithdrawn Amendment number eight\n\n\nWe have ten minutes left\n\n\nI will call on the Minister to reply\n\n\nTwo O Five Mr Ho\n\n<$D> \n\nNo Sir\n\n<$A> \n\nMr Teo\n\n<$A> \n\nNumber five Incik Zulkifli\n\n<$E> \n\nSir I beg to move that the sum to be allocated for Head S be\nreduced by ten dollars in respect of Code S G fifteen hundred of the main\nestimates\n\n\nSir under the existing Workmen Compensation Act manual workers are\ncovered by the Act regardless of their earnings\n\n\nHowever non-manual workers are covered only if they earn less than\none thousand two hundred and fifty dollars per month\n\n\nThis income ceiling for non-manual workers was last adjusted in\nnineteen eighty from seven hundred and fifty dollars to the present level of\none two five zero\n\n\nSir nineteen ninety one report published by NPB on productivity and\nwage growth differentials showed that the wage growth between nineteen eighty\none to nineteen ninety averages out to around six point six percent\n\n\nThus it has been twelve years now since the income ceiling for\nnon-manual workers was last revised\n\n\nIn my opinion Sir there are sufficient grounds for the Ministry of\nLabour to review this ceiling\n\n\nI would like to suggest that the ceiling be raised but would like\nto hear the Minister's view on this matter\n\n\nSecondly Sir I would like to touch on clause three b of the third\nschedule of the Workmen's Compensation Act\n\n\nOf late there appears to be some ambiguity in its interpretation as\nwas evidenced by the much publicised Workmen's Compensation case involving a\nworker and the management of SBS which was heard before the Commissioner over\nthe quantum of compensation to be awarded to the injured worker\n\n\nAlthough the matter was finally settled through a compromise a lot\nof unpleasantness and distrust has been generated\n\n\nOn the one hand the worker and his union contend that the\nmanagement in quibbling over the quantum to be award awarded\n\n\nOn the other hand the management believed he did the right thing by\nraising a fundamental question in wanting to know how the quantum was arrived\nat\n\n\nApparently the ambiguity ambiguity lies in the interpretation of\nas to what constitutes compensation payable in the case of permanent total\nincapacity as is proportionate to the loss of earning capacity\n\n\nIn the light of this case I would like to urge the Ministry of\nLabour to review the same clause and make the necessary amendment so that its\nprovision could be interpreted more clearly to avoid such a dispute from\nrecurring individual\n\n\nSir I beg to move\n\n<$A> \n\nQuestion is that the sum to be allocated for Head S be\nreduced by ten dollars in respect of Code S G fifteen hundred of the main\nestimates\n\n\nDr Chen\n\n<$F> \n\nMr Chairman Sir recently a union member suffered an injury\nwhile's at work and was given a total of fifteen days of outpatient medical\nleave and forty three days of hospitalization leave\n\n\nHis employer under the Ministry's advice paid him his full salary\nfor his hospitalization leave but only two third for his of his salary for\nthe outpatient leave\n\n\nThe Ministry's position appears to be based on clause four of the\nthird schedule of the Workmen's Compensation Act which provides that the\nworkmen suffering from temporary incap incapacity due to injuries at work is\nentitled to full wages for a period of sixty days if he's hospitalized\n\n\nand fourteen days if he is not hospitalized\n\n\nand thereafter to a payment every month of an amount equal to two\nthirds of his monthly earnings during the incapci incapacity or during a\nperiod of one year whichever period is shorter\n\n\nIt appears to me that the Ministry is treating the full salary\nentitlement under hospitalization leave\n\n\nand that under outpatient leave as an either-or situation\n\n\nThat is if a worker has been hospitalized then he would only be\npaid full wages for his hospital leave and not his outpatient leave\n\n\nSir I think this interpretation of the law is illogical and\nerroneous\n\n\nThe irony is that if the worker had just claimed for medical leave\nunder the Employment Act he would have been paid full salary\n\n\nIt is therefore unfair that the worker who is injured because of\nan accident at work should be placed at a disadvantage compared to a worker\nwho takes ordinary sick leave \n\n\nI'm of the view that the word 'and' appearing in the clause four\ngives an injured employee the right to claim full wages for both\nhospitalization and outpatient leave in respect of the same injury subject to\nthe maximum num number of days stipulated Sir if this is merely a problem of\ninterpretation I hope the Ministry would put it right But if the Ministry\nthinks that its interpretation is correct then the law should be amended to\nmake it in line with the Employment Act provisions May I have the Minister's\nview on this Thank you Sir Mr Speaker: Dr Ong Chit Chung: Mr Chairman Sir\nfirst I would uh take up the point raised by Mr Zulkifli The Workmen\nCompensation Act now covers seventy three percent of the total workforce\nbased on the labour force survey of nineteen ninety one It was last uh\nrevised as far as Workmen Compensation uh was concerned in nineteen eighty\none It is now about ten years and definitely it's time to review I'll like to\nthank the member for bringing this point up The Ministry is actively\nreviewing the quantum but we have to bear a number of factors in mind for\nexample the impact in terms of cost on employers as they have to buy uh\nlarger coverage in terms of insurance But with inflation and rising cost for\nour workers and uh we have also to take care of the interest of our workers\nand therefore we must revise the ceiling upwards The question is how much and\nwe are working on it Uh we will consult the NTUC and we thank the NTUC uh\nmembers for bringing this up With reference to the uh case uh brought up by\nMr Zulkifli about the SBS case I would like to say that the under the Workmen\nCompensation Act compensation for permanent incapacity takes into account the\nloss of earning capacity for every type of employment which the an injured\nworker was able to undertake at the time of the accident Therefore although\nthe injured worker continued to be employed in this case by SBS the\ncompensation awarded for permanent incapacity is meant to take into account\nthe likely loss of earnings which the worker will face if he were to take up\nany other employment It was on this basis that the injured worker in the SBS\ncase was awarded compensation of twenty four thousand six hundred Uh the\nMinistry view is that there is no ambiguity in terms of law and we will\nensure that workers are given full protection under the Workmen Compensation\nAct In this particular case the uh parties concerned came to a settlement\namongst themselves But if you go by precedent the Commissioner is likely to\nuh rule in favour of the worker I would like to thank uh Dr John Chen for\nbringing up this very important case of the uh SMRT I will not uh uh disagree\nwith him I think he has got it correct The Ministry has review its practice\non making a rigid or fine distinction between hospitalization and outpatient\nmedical leave Where there is no evidence of malingering or abuse the Workmen\nCompensation Department I will assure Dr Chen will advise employers to treat\nsuch outpatient leave as full pay leave up to a maximum of fourteen days I\nwill like to thank him again for bringing this up on behalf of all the\nworkers Mr Speaker: Inche Zulkifli Mr Zulkifli: Sir although I'm not quite\nhappy on the answer given on the SBS case but nevertheless I withdraw my\namendment", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d8e08c3d-2c5f-4b19-bf18-54293b99b3d7", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.587873+00:00"}
{"text": "Live from Parliament Ministry of Health\n\n\n\n<$A> \n\nNumber six Mr Das\n\n<$B> \n\nMr Chairman Sir I beg to move that the sum to be allocated for\nHead P to be reduced by ten dollars in respect of Code PE one five zero zero\nof the main estimates\n\n\nMr Chairman Sir I agree with the government's philosophy there is\nneed for preventive measures to help one remain healthy and what better way\nto do this than to start at the school level\n\n\nSir I'd like to point out to this House that there are far few\ndoctors uh looking after the school health service\n\n\nI've been informed Sir that there are four doctors at the clinics\nand eleven doctors in the field taking care of four hundred and fifty\nthousand pupils in our three hundred and fifty primary secondary uh\npre-university and junior colleges\n\n\nThese doctors are ably assisted by thirty staff nurses and eighteen\nassistant nurses\n\n\nSir only primary one and secondary four students are screened by\ndoctors\n\n\nThe screening at primary six is done by nurses\n\n\nIs this because of shortage of doctors\n\n\nAnd what about the quality of screening for these children at\nprimary six\n\n\nIs the Ministry satisfied with this level of screening\n\n\nAre other programs being sacrificed because of lack of doctors\n\n\nSir I would urge the minister to use his good offices to persuade\nthe Finance minister not to apply the zero growth in the case of school\nhealth services\n\n\nSir I beg to move\n\n<$A> \n\nQuestion is that the sum to be allocated for Head P be reduced\nby ten dollars in respect of Code PE fifteen hundred of the main estimates\n\n\nDr Wong\n\n<$C> \n\nMr Chairman uh I'm glad doc uhm Mr Chandra Das supports the\nMinistry's phil philosophy that prevention is better than cure and he also\nsupports the objectives of our school health service\n\n\nUhm with regard to the number of doctors in the school health\nservice actually it has increased from uh the number uh from ten in nineteen\neighty eight uh to fourteen uh this year and that is in spite of our zero uh\ngrowth uh policy\n\n\nUh on the number of nurses in the school health service uh I think\nhe's got the uh figure wrong\n\n\nIn fact uh we have now one hundred and four nurses in the whole\nschool health service\n\n\nUh the entire staff complement is hundred and eighty six so so uh\nit is by no means uh small uh staff complement\n\n\nand our expenditure has increased from five point four million in\nnineteen eighty eight to seven point three million\n\n\nNow whether medical screening uh should be done by doctors all the\ntime uh it is uh a matter of uh you know expert opinion also as a matter of\nthe end result the outcome\n\n\nIt is true that uh medical screening carried out uh in uh primary\none and uh secondary four are done by doctors while those uh at primary six\nare done by nurses\n\n\nBut our nurses are trained you see\n\n\nSo and and besides uh our children also get uh uh to have visual\nscreening every year\n\n\nThey also get spinal screening you know intermittently so it is not\njust the medical screening at primary one primary six and secondary four\n\n\nNow uh actually our children are very healthy and they are amongst\nthe healthiest age group in our population\n\n\nUh if by the time they enter primary school uh if they get very uh\nany severe medical condition they would have been picked up by our uh medical\nservices before they enter school\n\n\nAnd even during the school years those requiring specialist\nattention would have been sent to specialist outpatient clinic in the\nInstitute of Health\n\n\nUh and uh actually attendance uh attendance figures in our\npolyclinic show that the proportion of uh school children seeking medical\ntreatment at polyclinics uh is much lower than the other age groups\n\n\nSo all indications are that the present kind of medical screening\nservices we give at uh at in in our schools uh is adequate\n\n\nIt is better to utilise uh our scarce resources in other programs\nbut of course I welcome uh his support uh uh uh you know for our program to\nbe receiving more funds uh from the Ministry of Finance\n\n\nBut uh please rest assured uh uh in the opinion of medical uh\nexperts I think our school health is doing a good job\n\n<$A> \n\nMr Chairman Sir since the Minister of State welcomes my\nsuggestion I think the Ministry should work harder to get more staff\n\n\nOn that note Sir I beg leave to withdraw\n\n<$A> \n\nMember given leave to withdraw\n\n<$D> \n\nAy Ay\n\n<$A> \n\nYes withdrawn Amendment number seven\n\n\nDr Michael Lim\n\n<$E> \n\nSir I beg to move that the sum to be allocated for Head P be\nreduced by ten dollars in respect of Code PE five one O O of the development\nestimates\n\n\nPrimary health care is currently considered a poor cousin of\nhospital services but I believe that it is as important if not more important\nas secondary and tertiary health care\n\n\nA good primary health care service will result in early detection\nof diseases and prevention of complications\n\n\nIn developing new polyclinics we must not only continue to make it\naffordable but we must strive to improve the level of primary health care\n\n\nI have uh certain proposals which I would like the minister to\nconsider\n\n\nOne install X-ray facilities in all new polyclinics\n\n\nThe Ministry should consider installing X-ray facilities not only\nto improve the diagnostic capabilities but also by allowing general\npractitioners to use the X-ray facilities the level of primary health care in\nthat area will be enhanced\n\n\nFurthermore with a higher <unclear> word </unclear> it will result\nin more cost-effective use usage of the facilities\n\n\nNumber two set up rehabilitation facilities at all polyclinics\n\n\nThis will allow patients with stroke orthopaedic injuries and other\nphysical disabilities to have easy access to such facilities\n\n\nOtherwise the physical disabilities alone will discourage them from\ntravelling to the hospitals for rehabilitation\n\n\nEarly rehabilitation will allow the patient to integrate back into\nsociety and will relieve the social burden of family members\n\n\nThirdly medication\n\n\nPatients seen at hospitals are discharged at polyclinics for\nfollow-up when they are stable\n\n\nHowever in certain instances these drugs are not available at the\npolyclinics and there's no alternative drug within the same class of action\navailable in the polyclinic\n\n\nAs a result CFC card holders do not want to be discharged from\nspecialist clinics as they are unable to get the medication required\n\n\nI propose that the Ministry allow polyclinic doctors to make an\nindent for non-standard drugs for CFC card holders who require medication\ncurrently not available in the polyclinic pharmacy\n\n\nThese requests should only be allowed if the patients are sent to\nthe polyclinics from specialist in government and restructured hospitals\n\n\nThis will make it unnecessary for such patients to be seen at the\nspecialist clinic and hospitals just for the sake of being able to obtain the\nrequired medication\n\n\nLastly I quality of medical care\n\n\nAt this point I would actually like to agree with Dr Tan Cheng Bock\nwho said that there were certain problems about primary health care system\n\n\nI think one of the weaknesses and a very important weakness of our\ncurrent system in the polyclinics is a lack of continuity of medical care\n\n\nPatients with chronic medical conditions like diabetes are often\nattended to by different doctors at different visits\n\n\nAt each visit the harassed doctor scours the medical notes and\nmakes a hurried assessment as he has a large pool of patients waiting in line\nto see him\n\n\nFighting against the problems of unfamiliarity limited time and a\nlarge patient turnover he can only do his humanly best and will not be able\nto give optimal care\n\n\nFor the diabetic patient he can only try to adjust the medication\nto control the blood sugar level\n\n\nThere is no time to look for eye complications kidney complications\nvascular complications and there is definitely no time to give proper\ncounselling\n\n<$A> \n\nDr Lim\n\n<$E> \n\nHow does the Ministry\n\n<$A> \n\nDr Lim\n\n<$E> \n\nintend to improve the situation\n\n\nI would like the minister's views on these points\n\n<$A> \n\nQuestion is that the sum to be allocated for Head P be reduced\nby ten dollars in respect of Code P fifty one hundred of the development\nestimates\n\n\nDr Wong\n\n<$C> \n\nMr Chairman all our large polyclinics have laboratory on site\n\n\nThese are these laboratories are also opened to GPs to the general\npractitioners\n\n\nHowever the general practitioners' utilization of our polyclinic\nlaboratories has been poor comprising less than two percent of the laboratory\nworkload\n\n\nNow this is because some private labs are providing a special\nservice to the GPs collecting specimens from them at no additional charge\n\n\nand so GPs find it not necessary to send the patients to the\npolyclinic uh lab\n\n\nNow currently only one polyclinic at Tampines has an X-ray service\nwhich is also opened to GPs but again its utilization by GPs is very low\ncomprising less than five percent of the X-rays uh taken\n\n\nNow uh patients who who are discharged from government uh or\nrestructured hospitals uh the CSC card holders or other people can obtain\nnonstandard drugs at the polyclinics if they are patients of the polyclinics\n\n\nSo the idea is that they should be followed up on their polyclinic\n\n\nand if the use of non-standard drugs is warranted then uh an\napplication would be made for the drug to be supplied to polyclinics\n\n\nand at uh uh at the usual cost of one dollar per item up to a\nmaximum of four uh per uh uh per\n\n\nUh now uh the lack of continuous care I think uh we have covered\nthis subject quite well when I responded to Dr Tan Cheng Bock's uh uh\nproposal about uh community health care system\n\n\nThank you\n\n<$A> \n\nDr Lim\n\n<$E> \n\nSir just one last point\n\n\nThe reason why your lab facilities are not well utilized is not\njust the convenience but the cost as well\n\n\nIn fact it is more costly to do a lab test in the polyclinic than\nat a private uh lab\n\n<$C> \n\nIs that so I would look into it\n\n<$E> \n\nSir uh I thank the Minister for her reply and I beg leave to\nwithdraw my uh amendment\n\n<$A> \n\nIs member given leave to withdraw his amendment\n\n<$D> \n\nAy\n\n<$A> \n\nAmendment is withdrawn\n\n<$F> \n\nSir Doc Dr Tan has given us a very long discourse yesterday on\nprimary health care\n\n\nI'd urge him to please pay more attention to what we are doing so\nthat he he can better understand the whole philosophy because what\n\n<$A> \n\nOrder\n\n<$F> \n\nlet me let me finish\n\n\nSit down please\n\n<$G> \n\nMr Speaker Sir\n\n<$A> \n\nMinister is not giving way\n\n<$F> \n\nSir he's taken a lot a lot of time yesterday more time than\nhe should have\n\n<$G> \n\nNo I think\n\n<$F> \n\nBut so\n\n\nSit down first come on\n\n<$A> \n\nOrder order\n\n\nDr Tan resume your seat\n\n<$G> \n\nHe has spent a lot of time making mini ministerial statements\n\n<$A> \n\nDoc Dr Tan resume your seat please\n\n<$F> \n\nBecause all that he described is preci are precisely things\nthat we are already doing just that he's managed to call them under different\nname\n\n\nHe's quoted the Finnish model saying that we are under-spending\nwithout realizing from the data that actually we're spending more than what\nFinland is spending on primary health care\n\n\nSir Mr Loh was correct\n\n\nPrimary health care I think we are very well-established but\nnonetheless I appreciate his concerns\n\n\nand I can assure him that in our future studies and planning for\nthe primary health care I will definitely like to call on him to volunteer\nhis time in helping us to further improve primary health care\n\n\nSir in terms of hospital services I can assure him that we are we\nalso share his concerns in terms of ensuring that we do not over-provide\nmedical services in hospital area\n\n\nand that's why we've been freezing the number of beds for many\nmany years \n\n\nIn fact we've had a freeze for the last seven years on hospital\nbeds and we will continue to gauge very carefully the demand and to ensure\nthat only those who require hospitalization are being hospitalized and more\nimportantly to ensure that only those who require those investigations are\nbeing provided those investigations Otherwise he's right If everybody comes\nin with for all those tests unnecessarily we must invest more in e in\nequipment and that will be very very adverse in terms of doing Sir in terms\nof CFS I understand looking at the cards that some other MPs are also

{"text": "<$A> \n\nItem number two Mr Charles Charles Chong\n\n<$B> \n\nUh Mr Chairman Sir\n\n\nI beg to move the sum to be allocated for Head I be reduced by ten\ndollars in respect of Code I A fifteen hundred of the main estimates\n\n\nSir I note the Minister for Communications on the twentieth of\nFebruary this year released figures to indicate that our sea-port is the\nworld's number one three times over\n\n\nThe figures announced by the Minister showed that the PAS was the\nworld's number one container port\n\n\nand according to the Minister Singapore is also number one in terms\nof gross registered shipping tonnage\n\n\nand yet again number one in terms of the number of vessel movements\n\n\nUh Sir we just heard the Minister remind the House a few moments ago\nthat Changi airport is also number one in the world\n\n\nI would like to ask the Minister how important or necessary is our\ncurrent obsession with the number one position\n\n\nUh Sir I do not think many Singaporeans would dispute the fact that\nin order to survive and to prosper we need to constantly strive to be better\n\n\nHowever this obsession with the number one position in some cases\nmay be completely unnecessary\n\n\nFor example being number one for rules regulations and fines is\ndefinitely unnecessary\n\n\nIn other cases being number one may just not be good enough\n\n\nNow although the Singapore worker's been rated number one in the\nworld for more than a decade it does not mean that we have arrived\n\n\nIn fact there are still many areas that must be improved as pointed\nby by an honourable friend Dr Ow Ching Hock a few days ago in this House\n\n\nNow Sir if in striving to be the best we can be takes us to the top\nposition should we not enjoy being number one in the world a little more\nmodestly and quietly\n\n\nNow blowing our own trumpet whenever any survey no matter how in\ninsignificant it rates us as being number one in the world may not have very\nmany beneficial effects\n\n\nIt may mistakenly convey the impression on our people that we are\nalready the best that we can be\n\n\nHowever more significantly it may make us more prominent targets\nfor protectionist measures taken by the less competitive and the more envious\nwho may perceive us to be bigger competitors than what we actually are\n\n\nNow perhaps the Minister could give us his views on this subject\n\n\nUh Mr Chairman Sir with your kind permission could I now take my\nsecond cut\n\n\nHowever before speaking on Singapore's air services agreements I\nwould like to declare my special interest in this subject as an employee of\nSingapore airlines\n\n\nSir in the re in recently concluded air services agreements with\nother countries we appear to be giving away more liberal traffic rights to\nother carriers than what we receive for Singapore carriers\n\n\nIt also appears that despite this very liberal air policy\nSingapore's carriers still face apparent protectionist measures taken by\nother countries\n\n\nNow could the Minister comment this issue and let us know what\nadvantage our liberal air policy has on air carriers in Singapore and also on\nthe country as a whole\n\n\nSir I beg to move\n\n<$A> \n\nThe question is that the sum to be allocated for H I to be\nreduced by ten dollars in respect of Code 1 A fifteen hundred of the main\nestimates\n\n\nMr Mah\n\n\nSorry Mr Harun Ghani\n\n<$A> \n\nYou can take both cuts\n\n<$C> \n\nOkay thank you\n\n\nWhen Telecom introduced new pricing system for charging usage of\ntelephone our level of society felt that the action caused inconvenience to\npublic\n\n\nSir your Ministry of Communications became a target for this\nunhappiness\n\n\nHowever through the survey conducted in December ninety one\nreceived seventy three percent of the users would bear lesser than before\n\n\nThis relieved the public and less unhappiness heard\n\n\nSir indirectly Telecom has succeed into getting the public to be\nthirsty\n\n\nMy compliments to Minister of Telecommunications\n\n\nFurther to this I would like to know the information pertaining to\nthe public usage of telephone in months of January and February this year\n\n\nIf it is invariable with the finding in December and feedback\nreceived than the public will more relieved\n\n\nSir time-based price system indirectly may reduce the profit or may\nnot be profitable to Telecom\n\n\nTherefore how Telecom to reconcile reduction in revenue earned with\nexpansion planned by employing high-technology\n\n\nSir it seem that there is one more point which cause unhappiness to\nfactory employees who are using office telephones\n\n\nThose who work in factory will not be allowed uh able to use office\ntelephone\n\n\nIt would be better if Telecom provide card telephone in factory\noffice so that it can be used by the employees\n\n\nI raise this point because there are factories which want to\ninstall card telephone but was rejected by Telecom\n\n\nSecond cut Sir\n\n\nPermission\n\n\nThis year Telecom is entering privatization and definitely it will\nprovide big program which requires high-technology equipment and services\n\n\nBeside large amount of investment required services of skill level\nwill also play an important role in the excellent services provide by Telecom\n\n\nIn view of this will the employee be given skilled training or\nwhether they have been trained and ready to excel in providing such services\nin future\n\n\nWhat about those who are not able to adjust themselves to rapid\nexpansion of Telecom especially long service employees\n\n\nEither their services are no longer required or they've been\ntransferred to do tasks which different from their usual job\n\n\nand if their services are no longer required what sort of\ncompensation will Telecom provide for them\n\n\nSir Telecom intention to sell share to public as uh I think the the\nDPM already mentioned will not uh uh the idea\n\n\nIndeed it's appropriate move and shall be commended\n\n\nMy sincere is dead his employee should be given priority in\npurchasing the share through CPF saving or as to boost the morale of the\nemployees\n\n\nI'm saying this not because my wife is working with Telecom\n\n\nIt is just coincidence\n\n\nFor those who do not have CPF saving this is the time for them to\nstart saving and learn to be for the future and old age\n\n\nSir my hope my hope is that if Telecom want to reap large profit\nthrough privatization and increase capital expenditure on high technology and\nequipment the burden of bearing the high cost should not be shifted to\nconsumers only\n\n\nThank you Sir\n\n<$A> \n\nMr Mah\n\n<$D> \n\nMr Chairman Sir Mr Charles Chong asked why we are so obsessed\nwith always being the best in the world\n\n\nSir it is my fervent belief that we must maintain this obsession\nand I use the word obsession without apology\n\n\nSir maintaining a number one position for us is not an end in\nitself but a means to an end\n\n\nIf I can use our sea-port as an example why do we push and why do\nwe strive to keep the port of Singapore a number one container port a number\none port in terms of shipping and so on\n\n\nSir to remain the number one port is not just a matter of\ncollecting accolades which all Singaporeans can be proud of\n\n\nSure we are proud to be the number one port in the world\n\n\nBut more importantly is that with this achievement comes not only\npride but also very very tangible benefits\n\n\nEconomically the port creates jobs and it creates wealth for our\npeople\n\n\nThere're seven thousand workers directly employed by the PAS\nthere're another thirty eight thousand employed in industries which are\nrelated to the port\n\n\nLast year or in nineteen ninety the PAS contributed something like\ntwo percent to the national wealth\n\n\nAnd if we add the port-related industries warehousing ship-\netcetera the contribution rises to something like three to four percent of\nthe national wealth\n\n\nSo this is something like one quarter of the transport and\ncommunications sector's contribution to the national economy\n\n\nSo it's not just not not just a matter of being number one for its\nown sake but striving to be the best\n\n\nAnd in the process finding that we are the best in the world we are\nnumber one in the world and trying to maintain that position\n\n\nThere is no reason for us to feel apologetic about it\n\n\nI think if we can do it we should continue to try for it\n\n\nBut I have to add that this is not going to be plain-sailing\n\n\nThere're other ports that are coming up in the region\n\n\nThey are also believe it or not trying to number one\n\n\nThey've all upgraded their facilities in the last few years in\nterms of the kind of business that the port of Singapore carries out\n\n\nWe have to continue to make sure that we are more cost-competitive\nthan them\n\n\nWe are more efficient and we provide the best supporting services\n\n\nIf we can continue to do this we will continue to remain as the\nnumber one port in the in the region and in the world and we continue to reap\nthe benefits\n\n\nSir the government is aware that the PAS must have the necessary\nsupport particularly in the area of port capacity\n\n\nWe must be able to provide sufficient capacity to handle the amount\nof cargo that is to come our way\n\n\nSo PAS is now working closely with relevant government agencies to\nplan a new container port which will meet the needs of Singapore beyond the\ncentury and keep us as number one\n\n\nSir Mr Charles Chong also asked about our uh liberal open skies\npolicy\n\n\nI think it is a well-known fact that we have consistently adopted\nsuch a policy\n\n\nBasically what it means is that while we negotiate air rights on a\nbilateral basis with different countries we want to have as many of these\nbilateral agreements as possible\n\n\nOnce such an agreement is concluded we allow the other countries\nairline to fly to Singapore even if our national carrier has no immediate\nplans to fly to that country\n\n\nNow why do we do this\n\n\nThe reason is very simple\n\n\nIt brings us many benefits\n\n\nIt enhances tourism visitors from all parts of the world can get in\nand out of Singapore quickly and conveniently encourages investment it\nbenefits trade and most of all consumers will benefit from a wider choice of\nairlines and more convenient itineraries\n\n\nNow I sometimes like to think of our airport as a huge bus\ninterchange with flights coming in and out at such frequent intervals that\nsometimes people would rather come to Singapore catch a flight and then go on\nto their final destination destination rather than go directly because it is\nfaster and sometimes it's even cheaper to do it the this way\n\n\nSo while we continue to adopt this open skies policy I must mention\nthe fact that it does not mean that Singapore is prepared to give away more\nthan what we actually receive\n\n\nAnd in this respect whenever we have an air services negotiation\nit is the overall package of exchange that must be an equitable one\n\n\nand when I say equitable I'm talking about there being a balance\nof opportunities\n\n\nNot a balance of benefit but a balance of opportunities for both\nsides\n\n\nAnd the reason why we ask for a balance of opportunities is simply\nbecause we know that under such a situation we can compete with the best in\nthe world\n\n\nSir I turn to Harun Ghani's points\n\n\nI thank him for his concern that uh Singapore Telecom's profit\nwill be reduced because of introduction of time-based charges\n\n\nI he asked for some statistics latest statistics on telephone\nusage under the time-based charge\n\n\nIf I may present this Sir\n\n\nIn January nineteen ninety two that is uh January this year under\nthe flat under the flat rate system\n\n\nSir sorry sixty nine percent of the people paid less under the\ntime-based charge than under the flat rate system \n\n\nSo sixty nine people benefited from this conversion to the\ntime-based charge The corresponding figure for February ninety two the last\nmonth was seventy two percent the figure for December ninety one which was\nthe first month that the time-based charging system went into operation was\nvery close to this seventy three percent So more or less around the same\nfigure In fact Singapore Telecom collected less revenue from point six\nmillion dollars less in the three months December to February ninety two\ncompared to what it would have collected under the old system Sir Singapore\nTelecom as I've stated is in the process now of reviewing this time-based\ncharging system and all the views and options that have been expressed will\nbe taken into account in this review and an announcement of the outcome will\nbe made in due course Sir when Singapore Telecom is privatized uh TS will be\nreconstituted as a stat board and uh the activities of Singapore Telecom will\nbe overseen by this stat board Uh I wish to assure the member that uh the\ninterest of consumers will be safeguarded under the new situation when there\nis a separate statutory board On the point about unhappiness of private\nfactory employees not being allowed to use the phones uh I'm sure Telecom\nwill be pleased to install uh additional coin uh phones for them if they wish\nto do so Uh I think I've addressed the points that have been raised Mr\nSpeaker: Charles Chong Mr Charles Chong: Uh Sir I thank the Minister for his\nanswers and I beg leave to withdraw my amendment Mr Speaker: Member given\nleave to withdraw his amendment Amendment withdrawn", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

\n\nJanuary this year\n\n<$A> \n\nIn nineteen eighty four were you attached to the neuro surgery\ndepartment at Tan Tock Seng Hospital\n\n\nParticularly in September October November nineteen eighty

surgery eighty two\n\n<$B> \n\nI was trainee in neuro surgery at that time\n\n<$A> \n\nDoctor Balaji did you come across the first Plaintiff Jeya\nwife of Akkaiah whilst she was admitted to the neurosurgical unit of the Tan\nTock Seng Hospital on eighteenth October nineteen eighty four\n\n<$B> \n\nI do not recollect looking after this patient at that time\n\n\nand looking at the record I do not see my involvement in her\nmanagement at any time at that time\n\n<$A> \n\nSo the only occasion on which you saw the first Plaintiff was\non the twentieth of August nineteen ninety for the purpose of making this\nreport at page nineteen of the bundle\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nHow long did you see the first Plaintiff during this\nconsultation at the out patient dispensary\n\n<$B> \n\nForty five minutes about\n\n<$A> \n\nDoctor Balaji I may have to ask you a few questions from the\nrecords\n\n\nCan you please confirm to the Court that you have all the records\nfrom the hospital in

them\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nNow before we go to the records could you please kindly look\nat\n\n\nDo you have a bundle\n\n\nPlaintiff's bundle\n\n\nCould you please turn to page nine\n\n<$B> \n\nIs that Mister Baratham's report\n\n<$A> \n\nYes twenty fourth of September nineteen eighty five\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I have it in front of me\n\n<$A> \n\nYou have that\n\n\nAt the time when you were in the Department of Neuro surgery Doctor\nBaratham was the senior neurosurgeon and head of the department\n\n<$B> \n\nYes that is true\n\n<$A> \n\nNow Doctor Baratham in this particular report states Doctor\nBalaji she sustained a head injury with a skull fracture\n\n\nand on x ray was found to have air inside her head\n\n\nThis implied the possibility of infection and she was given\nprolonged course of antibiotics\n\n\nNo definite effects result from her head injury but she was treated\nby the orthopaedic surgeon for various orthopaedic injuries\n\n\nPlease make reference to orthopaedic report\n\n\nNow what would be your comment about the statement that there were\nno definite effects resulting from her head injury\n\n\nYou have now Doctor Balaji you have now seen the records of this\npatient\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I would say I do not agree with that\n\n<$A> \n\nYou do not agree with that\n\n<$B> \n\nYes for the following reasons if I may be allowed to give the\nreasons\n\n<$A> \n\nYes with that statement no definite effects result from her\nhead injury\n\n<$B> \n\nYes for the following reasons\n\n\nOne first with regard to the question of infection\n\n\nLooking through the records you find that patient febrile for many\ndays and\n\n<$C> \n\nSorry, patient\n\n<$B> \n\nYes when she was admitted in nineteen\n\n<$C> \n\nYes I didn't catch you what you said\n\n<$B> \n\nThe patient had fever for many days while the patient was in\nhospital\n\n\nAnd when there is air in the head and the patient has a fever it\nmust be assumed that most likely cause of the fever is an infection of the\nbrain\n\n\nI also have the benefit of Doctor Ong's report and testing\n\n\nHe just went by one of the functions of the frontal lobe which\nwould be intellect which we can measure objectively using I Q test\n\n\nThe patient's I Q test has dropped to below normal\n\n\nA normal I Q being between eighty to one hundred and twenty range\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd what was the reading of the I Q in the record\n\n<$B> \n\nI refer to page eighteen the second line\n\n\nThe psychological assessment done showed her to be functioning at\nborderline range of intelligence I Q sixty eight to seventy five\n\n<$A> \n\nNo Doctor Balaji I think you are jumping the sequence\n\n\nWe are still in eighty five\n\n\nThis report at page eighteen is made in nineteen eighty seven\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nSo levels of intelligence do change you must agree\n\n\nSo let's stick to ninety eighty five\n\n\nDoctor Baratham's report and you said that you did not agree with\nthat statement for a variety of reasons and you were giving those reasons\n\n<$B> \n\nYou see I disagreed with Doctor Baratham's statement in\nnineteen ninety\n\n\nIn nineteen eighty five when Doctor Baratham was making his report\nI have no input into this matter\n\n\nSo my decision or my statement or disagreement with him is based on\ninformation that is available to me in nineteen ninety\n\n\nWhether I would have disagreed with him in nineteen eighty five\nwhen he wrote the report I don't know\n\n<$A> \n\nDoctor Balaji in nineteen eighty five\n\n\nIf you had examined the first Plaintiff would you have made the\nsame statement as Doctor Baratham has made in his report\n\n\nNo definite effects result from her head injury\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know I would have to see the patient in order to give\nan opinion\n\n\nand not having seen the patient it's hard to say whether I would\nhave given the same opinion or not\n\n<$A> \n\nDoctor Balaji\n\n\nDoctor Baratham clarified just now that at the time when he made\nhis report on the twenty fourth of September nineteen eighty five he had not\nhad the occasion to have a consultation with the patient\n\n\nBut he made the report based on the hospital records\n\n\nI'm asking you that if you were in his shoes in nineteen eighty\nfive no consultation with the first Plaintiff purely based on the records\n\n\nWould you have made that statement\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy not\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause the patient stayed in hospital for a prolonged period\nof time\n\n\nPatient was in hospital for at least a month\n\n\nThere was air in the head which meant there was a fracture of the\nfront part of the skull\n\n\nThe patient had fever for many days and all this would have\nsuggested to me a serious injury to the brain\n\n<$A> \n\nDoctor Balaji what do you understand by that statement that\nDoctor Baratham made\n\n\nno definite effects result from her head injury\n\n<$B> \n\nI would understand it to mean that he thought he could not be\nsure that the head injury caused all her problems\n\n<$A> \n\nCan I ask you by reference to your records hospital records\n\n\nCan you please tell his Honour what were the complaints and\ncondition of the first Plaintiff at that time\n\n<$B> \n\nDuring the time of admission\n\n<$A> \n\nNo we're talking about September eighty five\n\n\nWell I'll take you through Doctor Balaji\n\n\nThe patient was the first Plaintiff was admitted on the eighteenth\nof April nineteen eight four\n\n\nShe stayed in hospital for one month during that time that she\nstayed in hospital what were her persistent or common complaints\n\n<$B> \n\nWhen she came in she was confused she was not obeying any\ninstructions\n\n<$C> \n\nThis was at the time of the accident or\n\n<$B> \n\nAt the time first day of admission\n\n\nTwo days after her admission her condition was still thought to be\nvery poor\n\n\nAbout ten days after admission we have the first note that states\nthat she is now conscious\n\n<$A> \n\nLet his Honour record want you are saying\n\n<$B> \n\nBut the report doesn't state what level of mental activity\nthere was\n\n\nBut that's the first note of her being conscious\n\n<$A> \n\nSo ten days after the admission she's conscious\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nRight\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then it's about two months or rather one and a half\nmonths after admission\n\n\nYou have the first note which states that she is now sounding a\nlittle rational\n\n<$A> \n\nIrrational\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n\nSounding rational first\n\n\nNote that she is not only conscious but she's now rational\n\n\nAt least in the eyes of the doctor the medical officer who wrote\nthat\n\n\nSo the main complaint appears to have been fever and her mental\nfunctions\n\n<$A> \n\nPlease look at the report carefully\n\n\nAre there any other complaints or condition that she suffered\nduring that time from the date of admission to the time she was normal\n\n<$B> \n\nYes she has got thigh ulcers\n\n<$A> \n\nNo I'm talking about from the neurological point of view\n\n<$B> \n\nFrom the neuro logic point of view\n\n\nNo nothing else in the record\n\n<$A> \n\nNo\n\n\nIs there any reference to poor memory\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nIs there any reference to incontinence\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nIs there any reference to her inability to control her bowel\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nIs there any reference to emotionally being emotionally\nlabile\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nDoctor Balaji you said that only after ten days the record\nshows that she was in a conscious state\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nRight\n\n\nCould you please look at page six of that bundle before you\n\n\nThe Plaintiff's bundle of documents which were given to you\n\n\nYour Honour page six of the P B\n\n\nYou have that\n\n\nThat's a report from Doctor Ong Tze Guan\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nNow in the first paragraph at the second sentence he says the\nabove-named was admitted to the Neuro logical Unit on seventeenth October\neighty four following a road traffic accident\n\n\nShe was conscious but confused\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nSo does your record show that she was admitted in a conscious\nstate or was she admitted in unconscious state\n\n<$B> \n\nThe first neuro logic examination states it as follows\n\n\nconfused but talking not obeying commands\n\n\nIf I may just make\n\n<$A> \n\nBut it must show that therefore she was conscious\n\n<$B> \n\nNo if I might make a note about the word the interpretation\nof the word conscious\n\n\nConsciousness from a neuro logic view in examining a person is a\nspectrum\n\n\nOn one spectrum one end of it is the person who totally comatose\nwithout any kind of response and at the other extreme is a person who is\ntotally normal in function\n\n\nAnd in between these there are gradations of consciousness\n\n\nAnd one of the important parameters we go by is whether the person\ncan follow instructions\n\n\nIf the person cannot follow instructions then a lot of those\nmental functions that you have asked about like memory emotional liability\nand all this cannot in any way be tested\n\n\nNeither are they of any\n\n\nThey're all impaired because that person is not in communication\nwith his environment even though he is sort of awake in the sense that his\neyes are open\n\n\nSo that would be impaired consciousness\n\n<$A> \n\nBut according to the hospital records she was not admitted in\nan unconscious state although\n\n<$B> \n\nShe was not admitted in a comatose state\n\n\nBut she was admitted\n\n<$C> \n\nSo the person was confused is confused\n\n<$B> \n\nShe's admitted confused\n\n\nUnable to follow any instructions\n\n<$A> \n\nBut not comatose\n\n<$B> \n\nNot comatose\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd the reference to her becoming conscious on the tenth day\nafter admission\n\n\nWould you agree that that is the day when she can probably\ncommunicate with he environment understand instructions and so on\n\n<$B> \n\nYes that's probably when she began to follow some\ninstructions\n\n<$A> \n\nNow during the stage when a patient or person is not in a\nconscious state because she was not able to communicate with the environment\n\n\nWould such a patient also have problems with incontinence and\nproblems relating to controlling the bowel\n\n<$B> \n\nYes in the sense that they will not ask to go to the bathroom\nor things like that\n\n\nand so they have social incontinence the mechanism itself is\nworking\n\n\nBut they don't have the mental ability to take care of themselves", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "35dbd0c9-7403-4d25-b2f8-04b9ed661529", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.591641+00:00"}

\n\nForty four is the later one\n\n<$A> \n\nNever mind\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n\nYes I knew the background of the problem that he said\n\n\nThe paint applied on the acrylic board then to get cobwebs and

simulate the actual way of application\n\n\nAnd see whether we see what type of result to get that's all\n\n<$A> \n\nBut your ultimate objective was to see whether the paint would\ncrack\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nNow was it your objective in this test in A B forty four to\nfind out the cause of cracking\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nIn other words you would not be able to say anything about the\ncause of the cracks is that\n\n<$B> \n\nNot in this particular report not the cause of the cracks\n\n\nBut it's an observation that's all\n\n<$A> \n\nI refer you now to this A B forty four the details of it\n\n\nAlright at introduction line three you said by applying various\nKansai coloured paints diluted with plat top thinner\n\n\nWhat coloured paints were these\n\n<$B> \n\nAll sorts of colours\n\n\nWhite yellow red black\n\n<$A> \n\nFour colours five colours\n\n<$B> \n\nWell one two three four\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd you diluted these paints only with plat top number eleven\n\n<$B> \n\nI didn't dilute\n\n\nIt was if you read the report\n\n\nIt was diluted by the well by the workers when I was there\n\n\nThat is stated in my report\n\n<$A> \n\nWhere does it say\n\n<$B> \n\nIt said diluted with plat top thinners on clean acrylic boards\nwith the help of Mister Lee Ah Yong of Comsign and his technicians\n\n<$A> \n\nIn other words these paints samples were diluted\n\n<$B> \n\nIn front of me during my presence\n\n<$A> \n\nBy Comsign officers\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nIn your presence\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nNow Mister Yeoh are you able to comment whether the dilution\nby these officers of Comsign is a proper one\n\n<$B> \n\nProper in what sense\n\n<$A> \n\nSuitable for application\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I put it again in my application\n\n\nThe paint on the third paragraph the paint was then diluted with a\nthinner to a certain degree which by the opinion of Mister Lee was suitable\nfor spraying\n\n<$A> \n\nIn other words Mister Yeoh on the question of dilution you\nleft it to the opinion of Mister Lee\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nAs to what was suitable\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm I think can I make a comment on that\n\n<$A> \n\nYes sure\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause I think they because they are using a sprayer so they\nare the one who knows best how dilute or how viscous the paint should be for\ntheir own sprayer\n\n<$A> \n\nYes but Mister Yeoh would you not agree that if a paint is\nexcessively or under diluted it would have unsatisfactory effects on the\noutcome of the paint work\n\n<$B> \n\nCan you just repeat it please\n\n<$A> \n\nIf someone were to over dilute the paint would that not affect\nthe result\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I think if a paint is over diluted you will find that it\nwould not be able to stick on as good as what it\n\n\nThere is a certain percentage that you have to mix and you can't\nbe too dilute because it would not stay\n\n<$A> \n\nIt would crack\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know whether it will crack or or\n\n<$A> \n\nIt will peel off\n\n<$B> \n\nProbably even when it dry off\n\n\nProbably everything will be gone because if it's too dilute\n\n\nThat means you\n\n\nI'm not too sure how I can put it to you but in my opinion is you\nhave to have a certain degree of mixing before you can make the paint stays\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay Mister Yeoh in other words there is a correct proportion\nof dilution of paints\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd if you were to over dilute the result would be\nunsatisfactory\n\n<$B> \n\nWell it will be generally unsatisfactory\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd yet Mister Yeoh in this test on the question of the\nsuitable dilution of paints you left it to Mister Lee or his workers\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I mean the reason I explained earlier that they supposed\nto know best that what is the concentration required for their sprayer\n\n\nBecause if you have too concentrated you may find problem to spray\nout\n\n\nIf too dilute also you will be you know flying all over the place\n\n\nSo I presume that they have been doing this job for years\n\n\nThey should know what is the best\n\n\nThat's why I put in in their opinion you know\n\n<$A> \n\nI asks you again Mister Yeoh do you agree that if you were to\nover dilute or under dilute a paint plastic paint it may cause cracking of\nthe paint cracking or peeling\n\n<$B> \n\nI would not comment on that no\n\n\nBut I would imagine that in fact in the first place if you\n\n<$A> \n\nNo sorry sorry you are not able to comment or you will not\ncomment on that\n\n<$B> \n\nI would not be able to comment\n\n<$A> \n\nBut you agree that there is a suitable range of dilution\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n\nMay I add\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nIn my opinion the paint that appears here the painted surface\nin my opinion is reasonable in the sense that it's not a diluted over diluted\ntype of paint that is to stick on this \n\n\nChief Justice: Can you repeat that please \n\n<$B> \n\nNo in my opinion this particular for this particular sample\nthese two samples\n\n\nI think it has been properly applied with suitable amount of paint\nthere is not the over diluted paint\n\n\nThat's what you like to put it to me just now\n\n\nBecause we can see the paint it is not a thin paint\n\n\nIt is not a thin paint work\n\n<$A> \n\nI'll come back to that later Mister Yeoh when you say you\nconduct a test under experimental conditions\n\n\nShould not you or your laboratory staff be conducting every aspect\nof the test\n\n<$B> \n\nNo it's not necessary This is not the first instance that we\ncarry out investigation in this manner\n\n\nIt is not necessary that we have to do from A to Z\n\n\nIn fact we leave it to whoever who knows best to do it but of\ncourse to our own satisfaction\n\n<$A> \n\nNext paragraph\n\n\nThe acrylic boards used were fresh from stock\n\n\nWhat do you mean by that\n\n<$B> \n\nYes because it was taken out from a wrapping\n\n\nIn my opinion it is fresh\n\n<$A> \n\nNow what size and shape is this\n\n<$B> \n\nThis is a for this particular one all this are original shape\n\n<$A> \n\nNow did you examine the boards with the cracked paint\n\n<$B> \n\nWhich board which board you're talking about\n\n\nYou're talking about this sample or you're talking\n\n<$A> \n\nNo the boards that were painted by the Plaintiffs\n\n<$B> \n\nYou mean the signboard you're talking about\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I saw the signboard myself\n\n<$A> \n\nDid you examine them\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nAre these the ones with the Shell logo\n\n<$B> \n\nSorry\n\n<$A> \n\nAre these the ones with the Shell logo\n\n<$B> \n\nYes with the Shell logo\n\n<$A> \n\nNow are the cracks that appeared in your experiment of the\nsame nature as the ones that were painted by Plaintiffs\n\n<$B> \n\nSimilar the cracks look similar\n\n<$A> \n\nAre you satisfied that the cracks in the experiment and on\nthe boards painted by the Plaintiffs were caused by the same cause\n\n<$B> \n\nI have no comment on what\n\n<$A> \n\nYou have no comment\n\n<$B> \n\nNo I have no comment on that\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd under Observations second paragraph second line you said\nit could not be confirmed if the acrylic board had been affected as well as\nremoval of paint by a solvent could tarnish the acrylic surface\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nCan you explain this\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat really we meant in this report was we saw the cracks\n\n\nOkay this is on a applied surface and this is a unapplied surface\nand now you read the cracks from this end from the unapplied surface and you\ncan see the cracks you can see the cracks\n\n\nIf you like we have to like to show to the Lord \n\n\nChief Justice: These are the cobweb-like cracks \n\n<$B> \n\nYes Yes that's how the\n\n\nSo by these observations we could not confirm that whether the\nacrylic surface has whether these cracks only on the paint itself or whether\nit has eaten into the acrylic surface\n\n\nThat is what I mean I could not confirm\n\n<$A> \n\nWitness I next refer you to A B thirty three your other\nreport\n\n\nNow under item H you have stated plastic strips said to be made of\nacrylic plastic material\n\n\nWhy have you qualified the words in that manner\n\n<$B> \n\nWell we did not confirm that whether this is acrylic or not\n\n\nIt's said to be because it was given to us and said this is an\nacrylic board\n\n\nThat's why we put down as said to be\n\n<$A> \n\nIn other words you cannot confirm that this is an acrylic\nboard\n\n<$B> \n\nWell if we were to ask to confirm we could do another test to\nconfirm whether this is acrylic material or not\n\n\nBut at that instance we just because after all the board was given\nto us say this was the board that's been used for the actual paint work", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

your report to the Court\n\n<$B> \n\nThis patient was admitted on the twenty-seventh April nineteen\neighty-one following a road traffic accident\n\n\nSpecial x rays did not show hemorrhage inside the brain but he was\nthought to have suffered a bruising of the brain\n\n\nThe medical term for that is contusion\n\n\nSince then he has been followed up as an outpatient\n\n\nA final assessment can only be made after a year\n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n\nSo you confirm doctor that you examined this patient and you found\nthat there is a bruising on his brain\n\n\nIs that correct\n\n<$B> \n\nThat is correct my Lord\n\n<$A> \n\nNow how severe was this injury\n\n<$B> \n\nIt was sufficient to cause changes on the C T scan which were\nof a temporary nature\n\n\nBut not sufficient to cause bleeding inside the brain my Lord\n\n<$A> \n\nNow may I refer you to the second report which you made on the\neighteenth of May eighty-two\n\n\nYou mention here that he was found to have some problem of\nco-ordination\n\n\nNow what type of problem would you classify that as\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't quite understand the question\n\n<$A> \n\nI mean what type of\n\n\nHe had some problem of co-ordination\n\n\nHow severe and what characteristic would these problems of\nco-ordination would be\n\n<$B> \n\nHe would have difficulty in performing a number of sequential\nactions that is moving in an ordered sequence learnt movement\n\n\nMy Lord the technical word for this is dyspraxia D Y S P R A X I A\nwhich means\n\n<$A> \n\nNow in this report you also mentioned that the C T scan did\nnot show any blood clot inside the skull\n\n\nNow this was done in nineteen eighty-two\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nNo eighty\n\n<$B> \n\nNo the C T scan done on at the time of admission in April\nnineteen

there is a blood clot\n\n<$B> \n\nThere was at the time of accident a contusion of the brain\nseen on the C T scan not a blood clot\n\n\nI want to distinguish between a contusion and a hemorrhage\n\n<$A> \n\nJust to reconfirm that I got what you have said\n\n\nAt the time of the accident you examined him and there was a\ncontusion in the brain\n\n<$B> \n\nI examined the C T scan my Lord\n\n<$A> \n\nYa that is right\n\n<$B> \n\nThat showed the contusion\n\n<$A> \n\nCorrect\n\n\nThat is all\n\n<$B> \n\nThe patient had symptoms of a contusion\n\n<$A> \n\nHow long will this contusion last\n\n\nI mean does it stay on forever\n\n<$B> \n\nThe appearance my Lord on the x-ray on the C T scan would be\nobvious for a week few weeks or few months\n\n\nJust like a bruise it would disappear but the effects on the brain\nmay last for a considerably longer period\n\n<$A> \n\nNow I refer you to the last report which is sixth of September\neighty-three\n\n\nIn paragraph two you have reported that you have examined him on\nthe seventh of August nineteen eighty-three and that he was found to have\nin-co-ordination of the right side of his body\n\n\nNow can you tell the Court more about what in-co-ordination that\nyou found\n\n<$B> \n\nWe test for in-co-ordination my Lord in a very standard way\n\n\nWe ask a person to touch your finger and touch his nose and move up\nand down or to do a series of concerted actions like imitating playing the\npiano or picking up objects\n\n\nAnd by observing him do this we can notice any problems with\nmovement\n\n<$A> \n\nIn your opinion doctor do you know whether such injury would\nbe permanent\n\n\nThe in-co-ordination\n\n<$B> \n\nIt was present my Lord for more than two years after the\naccident\n\n\nAnd I would therefore assume that it would permanent\n\n<$A> \n\nFrom this injury to his brain doctor would you say that there\nwould be any side effect like for instance loss of memory headaches relapses\n\n<$B> \n\nHe could have mental problems but by his own testimony my\nLord he did not complain of headaches and said he was otherwise normal\n\n\nThis is on my examination in August eighty-three\n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n\nYou also mentioned in the last paragraph that because of his\nimpairment he will be unable to do his job as a welder\n\n\nIs that correct\n\n<$B> \n\nThat is correct my Lord\n\n\nIt's in my report\n\n<$A> \n\nI have no more further questions Sir\n\n<$C> \n\nDoctor Baratham when he was first admitted to the hospital on\nthe twenty-seventh of April nineteen eighty-one the x-ray showed a mere\ncontusion\n\n\nIs that not right or is that not right\n\n<$B> \n\nThe brain scans show the contusion my Lord\n\n\nI don't know about mere or it showed a bruising on the surface of\nthe brain\n\n<$C> \n\nOh I see\n\n\nSo and he was not hospitalised\n\n\nWas he discharged immediately on the same day\n\n<$B> \n\nNo I am certain my Lord he was hospitalised\n\n<$C> \n\nFor how long\n\n<$B> \n\nI do not have a record of that not available\n\n<$A> \n\nSir with your leave\n\n\nSir my apologies to the Court\n\n\nI have not submitted the medical certificate\n\n\nMay I Sir\n\n<$B> \n\nSorry Sir\n\n<$A> \n\nAuthorised by Doctor Baratham Sir\n\n<$A> \n\nI am obliged Sir\n\n\nSir may that be admitted since they've agreed\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nI am obliged Sir\n\n<$C> \n\nHe was according to the medical cert he was discharged on the\nseventh of May nineteen eighty-one\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$C> \n\nNow what were your observations while he was warded doctor\n\n\nI mean was there any in co-ordination in this hand\n\n\nOr what was he suffering from while he was warded\n\n\nOr is it just a brain contusion\n\n<$B> \n\nMy Lord I do not recall what my observations were when he was\nwarded because I would have been in charge of a very large number of cases\n\n\nAnd my own observations for each individual case would not have\nbeen made\n\n<$B> \n\nMy Lord I would have supervised his treatment rather than be\nin charge of his day-to-day treatment\n\n<$C> \n\nDoctor your medical report is brief\n\n\nIt merely states that he had a bruising of the brain and nothing\nelse\n\n<$B> \n\nThat is correct\n\n<$C> \n\nThen on the next page that is I mean your second medical\nreport on the eighteenth of May nineteen eighty-two\n\n\nThat's at page two of the Plaintiff's bundle of documents\n\n\nAnd your second medical report doctor you again merely refer to\nthe original x ray taken on the twenty-seventh of April nineteen eighty-one\n\n\nSo there was no further examination as such\n\n<$B> \n\nThere was no further x ray examination my Lord\n\n\nNo correct\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd this report merely states that he was last seen as an\noutpatient on ninth September eighty-one when he had some problems of\nco-ordination\n\n\nHe was not seen by you is that not doctor\n\n\nHe was seen by some other doctor on that date as an outpatient\n\n<$B> \n\nYes he may not have been seen by me when I\n\n<$C> \n\nSo you wouldn't be able to assist this Court as to what his\nproblems of co-ordination were on that date\n\n<$B> \n\nNot on this date no my Lord\n\n<$C> \n\nNow on your third report doctor\n\n\nOn your third report you say he was reassessed for the purpose of\nthis report on seventeenth August eighty-three\n\n\nAt that time he was found to have in-co-ordination of the right\nside of his body\n\n\nDoes this refer to your first paragraph which says this man was\nadmitted to our unit on April nineteen eighty-one\n\n\nDoes this report refer to the earlier findings of in-\nco-ordination rather than on that date\n\n<$B> \n\nIt refers to my own assessment of him in August eighty-three\n\n\nThe in-co-ordination refers to the situation in August nineteen\neighty-three\n\n\nMy Lord I alter that to at the time at the time\n\n\nThe second sentence in paragraph two should read at the time\n\n\nIt's at that time\n\n\nI think this is a typographical error or a dictation error or it\nshould be at the time\n\n<$B> \n\nAt the time of this report on the time of this examination on\nthe seventeenth August nineteen eighty-three\n\n\nMy Lord I am sorry for the ambiguity\n\n\nThis is the third report my Lord\n\n<$C> \n\nSee Doctor Baratham you seem to have in your report accepted\nthis man's word rather than gone on your own observation because your\nparagraph there\n\n\nIt says prior to this accident this man was a welder\n\n\nHe was tested by the foreman of his firm and his co-ordination was\nfound to be inadequate for a job of a welder\n\n\nThis is what he seems to have told you\n\n\nThis is not something you found out from the foreman of his firm\n\n<$B> \n\nMy Lord I was not in communication with the foreman of the\nfirm\n\n\nHe told me this\n\n<$C> \n\nHe told you this\n\n<$B> \n\nBut his in-co-ordination was something I tested for and\nobserved myself\n\n\nI did not my Lord feel competent to decide whether his in-\nco-ordination made it impossible for him to be a welder\n\n\nI thought that was better left to his foreman\n\n<$C> \n\nSo you were not\n\n<$B> \n\nI couldn't tell this my Lord\n\n\nI could tell his in-co-ordination\n\n\nI couldn't say whether he could do a job as a welder\n\n\nI am unfamiliar with welding\n\n<$C> \n\nSo that is exactly the point doctor\n\n\nThat you are unable to say whether he can work as a welder or not\n\n<$B> \n\nI am unable to say this\n\n\nIt is impossible for me to decide that my Lord\n\n<$C> \n\nNext you say in your report that he only had a moderate head\ninjury\n\n\nWhat do you mean by that\n\n<$B> \n\nThat is correct my Lord\n\n\nWe classify head injuries into mild concussions moderate injuries\n\n\nWhere we have some clear cut evidence of permanent brain damage\nand severe head injuries when the brain damage and severe head injuries is\nsuch that the person can be totally incapacitated", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source":

indeed\n\n<$A> \n\nIn a matter of eight years the patient coming with only a\nknowledge of Tamil language is able to speak good Malay\n\n\nWould it not reflect that prior to the accident her I Q must have\nbeen above average\n\n<$B> \n\nI think to learn a language and master a language one need not\nbe above average\n\n\nOtherwise a lot of people would not be able to speak\n\n\nI think it would be safe to say that to master a language\nsufficiently an I Q even a borderline I Q should be able to pick up the\nnecessary language\n\n\nYou see that's the basis of the kind of training that are given

therefore be above average\n\n\nThen we are ruling out all the E S N's from learning any language\nisn't it\n\n<$A> \n\nBut the fact that she could pick up a new language in a new\nenvironment would show that she had good intelligence\n\n<$B> \n\nI wouldn't say good intelligence\n\n\nsufficient intelligence to learn a new language\n\n<$A> \n\nYou did not ward her in any hospital to observe her\n\n<$B> \n\nNo I did not\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd your report is based on these two short interviews you had\nwith her\n\n<$B> \n\nBased on it\n\n\nInterviews plus the assessment\n\n<$A> \n\nAssessment reports\n\n<$B> \n\nThat we had made\n\n<$A> \n\nDid she understand what this examination was all about\n\n<$B> \n\nThis was put to her at the second session and as I said\n\n\nShe did not say whether she understood or don't understand\n\n\nSo I'm not able to ascertain that point\n\n<$A> \n\nExactly your Honour\n\n\nNow in your first interview you found her answers were vague and\nunspontaneous and at times appeared inconsistent\n\n\nWhat impression did you gather at that moment during your first\ninterview\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I leave an open mind\n\n\nThere are many possibilities and in my trade the fact that the\nperson has this trait could mean many things\n\n\nThere are many causes as you know for a person being vague and so\nforth\n\n\nAnd of course as results keep coming in then one becomes slowly\ncertain why she was vague etceteras\n\n<$A> \n\nDid you observe doctor that if you asked a leading question\nshe would easily answer yes\n\n<$B> \n\nNo no\n\n<$A> \n\nFor example if you ask her are you living at Telok Blangah\n\n\nThe answer would be yes\n\n<$B> \n\nNo not true\n\n<$A> \n\nHow was your questions put to her\n\n<$B> \n\nSome of the questions we get her to describe some were leading\nquestions\n\n\nBut I would think that the proportion would be fifty-fifty\n\n\nIn fact in psychiatric examination we are instructed that we do not\nask leading questions as much as we can\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd the other questions\n\n<$B> \n\nDirect questions requiring a yes or no\n\n\nAnd in some instances she didn't exactly give yes\n\n\nIn fact sometimes she give no\n\n\nAt the second interview do you watch T V\n\n\nShe says No\n\n<$A> \n\nDid you notice any difficulty in her shifting from one topic\nto another\n\n<$B> \n\nNo difficulty\n\n\nIn fact I do it very often in my interview\n\n\nIt's a technique I have developed to pick up certain things and I\nmove from one to the other\n\n\nAnd I noticed that she was able to respond\n\n<$A> \n\nYou look at page one of your report doctor at the bottom\n\n\nShe was complaining to you about her body pains and despite that\nshe was not able to point out exactly where the headache was\n\n\nHow do you explain that\n\n<$B> \n\nI can't explain that\n\n\nI put it as a statement of fact that she can't\n\n\nYou see she was describing her symptoms and all that\n\n\nSo when she stopped I said well but where's the headache\n\n\nAnd then she she didn't respond\n\n\nSo I don't know what to make out of that\n\n\nIt can be due to so many reasons isn't it\n\n<$A> \n\nA normal person doctor if he complains about stomach pain or\nheadache will tend to put the hand at the abdomen or in the forehead but not\nso in this case\n\n<$B> \n\nNot so in that yes\n\n\nThe question is why\n\n<$A> \n\nDid it not strike that something was abnormal on her\n\n<$B> \n\nWell something is abnormal but the question then your Honour\nis why would the person not respond\n\n\nYou see if you want to take the whole range you can say this is\ndue to brain damage\n\n\nYou can take the other extreme end and you can say that this is\nmalingering this is hysterical\n\n\nIt's a whole range you see\n\n\nSo I refuse to commit myself\n\n\nI put it as a statement of fact\n\n<$A> \n\nYou are aware that she had an injury to her frontal lobe\n\n<$B> \n\nIndeed\n\n\nThis was what she said as well or her husband said to the\n\n<$A> \n\nNo I'm talking about the patient\n\n\nForget about the husband for the time being because your interview\nis restricted to the patient\n\n\nDid she complain to you anything else apart from the bodily pains\n\n\nWhat did she complain of\n\n<$B> \n\nShe complained of headaches her head bursting giddiness a lot\nof symptoms in relation to the head\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd did you conduct any test for her memory\n\n<$B> \n\nYes my psychologist did the Graham Kendall's Memory for\nDesign Test which showed eleven which is borderline up to about twenty-five\nis considered borderline\n\n\nI think roundabout seven is considered borderline\n\n\nSo she I would say she get quite a high score\n\n\nThe lower the score the normal it is\n\n\nThe higher the score the more abnormal it is\n\n\nSo we didn't arrange a borderline from say seven to about\ntwenty-four\n\n\nShe score about eleven which I think is quite good\n\n\nObviously she has definite memory deficits but her memory deficits\nstrike me on the testing as mild\n\n\nIt's considered borderline\n\n<$A> \n\nBut she had some difficulty performing the task\n\n\nShe was slow\n\n<$B> \n\nYes she was slow which my psychologist document\n\n\nYou can read that in his report\n\n<$A> \n\nNow did you find out what was her attitude towards her\nchildren\n\n<$B> \n\nI did ask her about her children and she says she's quite\nhappy with the children\n\n\nAnd she said that they were good to her\n\n\nSo I put her a direct question\n\n\nSo are you therefore happy with them\n\n\nShe just kind of again stared blankly\n\n<$A> \n\nNo answer\n\n<$B> \n\nNo answer\n\n\nSo she doesn't answer yes to direct questions that's one and two\n\n\nHer response again would indicate a wide variety of conditions\n\n\nSo I feel that it's I would put it down as a matter of fact rather\nthan comment on it\n\n<$A> \n\nDid you also observe that in one moment she would say\nsomething and the next moment she'll forget\n\n<$B> \n\nNot all the time\n\n<$A> \n\nBut were there instances of such\n\n<$B> \n\nThere were perhaps one or two instances when she would behave\nlike that\n\n\nAgain the significance of this behaviour like with this is open to\nquestion\n\n\nIt can be argued\n\n<$A> \n\nFor example doctor you said that you were asking about the\nchildren and finally you put a question to her\n\n\nAnd the answer is negative\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nHow would you explain to that condition\n\n<$B> \n\nWell as I said there are many different explanations from\nthat\n\n\nIt can be due to depression\n\n\nIt can be due to brain damage\n\n\nCan be due to malingering or hysteria\n\n\nWhatever one can put to it you see\n\n\nThere's a whole range of explanations\n\n\nFor instance when I asked her how many legs a dog has and she\ndon't respond for a minute\n\n\nI thought that she won't say anything\n\n\nSo I was very pleasantly surprised when she says four\n\n\nI'm glad I waited\n\n\nHad I been impatient I would have lost that\n\n\nSo I'm not sure whether in fact you know one can say it's due to\nbrain damage\n\n\nI mean the causes of such responses such behavioural responses are\nmany\n\n\nAnd at this point in time I want just to describe what actually\nhappened and state it there\n\n<$A> \n\nDid you discuss with her about what plan she has for her\nfamily her sons\n\n<$B> \n\nWe tried to but she doesn't want to consider that\n\n<$A> \n\nThere was no response\n\n<$B> \n\nWell she showed by her demeanour that she doesn't want to\nrespond to it\n\n<$A> \n\nIn such circumstances doctor\n\n\nDo you think that she would be able to live independently\n\n<$B> \n\nI think again it's very hard to say\n\n\nWhy would a person not be interested to discuss the future\n\n\nI think again one can think of a variety of causes that can cause\na person to act and behave in that way\n\n\nAnd I do not want to straitjacket myself and say it is due to this\none thing or put it down first and let's consider what other possible causes\n\n<$A> \n\nDo you think that she'll be able to lead an independent life\n\n<$B> \n\nI think so because in my view I am increasingly convinced\nlooking at Doctor Ong's report that a lot of it all could be due to phobic\nanxiety\n\n\nAnd a large degree I think to a depression that probably I\nhesitate to say this\n\n\nBut I think it's probably inadequately treated\n\n<$A> \n\nSuppose you give her a ten dollar note doctor and ask her to\ngo down to the market just below her apartment and do the daily marketing for\nthe day\n\n\nDo you think she'll be able to carry out that function\n\n<$B> \n\nWell Doctor Ong says that she could handle small amount of\nmoney in one of his earlier reports\n\n\nIf that's the case I would expect that if we can overcome the\nphobia and get her out of the home\n\n\nOn the basis of what Doctor Ong said\n\n\nI would say yes\n\n<$A> \n\nBut at this moment do you think she would be able to \n\n<$B> \n\nAt this moment a lot of motives will contaminate the\nbehaviour isn't it\n\n\nMotives of tranquil\n\n<$A> \n\nMy question is at this moment do you think she would be able\nto carry out the function of a housewife like going to the market", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "cb70df57-56d7-4a2b-abdb-6a738ebb094b", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.594866+00:00"}

mark there one lead to the more or less\nthe centre of the centre part and the other one on the left side\n\n<$C> \n\nCould you tell us which one leads to where\n\n<$B> \n\nThis one leads to the

anything\n\n<$C> \n\nSorry what's your answer\n\n\nAre you saying that one of them you are saying that one of them\nleads to the\n\n<$B> \n\nOne the scratch mark leading to the left and one to the\ncentre\n\n<$C> \n\nFrom the photographs\n\n<$B> \n\nFrom the photographs yes my Lord\n\n<$C> \n\nFrom your investigations can you tell us with reference to\nthe sketch plan\n\n\nAt which part of the road did the pick-up overturned\n\n<$B> \n\nThe pick-up was lying on the centre lane my Lord\n\n<$C> \n\nNo\n\n\nActually what I wanted was\n\n\nSergeant can you indicate perhaps on the sketch plan where the\npick-up started\n\n\nWhere did it start to overturn\n\n<$B> \n\nI am not able to tell my Lord\n\n<$C> \n\nYes I will sir\n\n\nOkay finally you inspected the pick-up after the accident\n\n<$B> \n\nYes my Lord\n\n<$C> \n\nWas it in road worthy condition\n\n\nActually I am referring to the inspection of the because normally\nafter the accident they inspect the vehicle to see if there is any defect\n\n\nBlatant defect or anything that would whether the vehicle was in\nfact road worthy before the accident\n\n\nI believe they have a report\n\n\nI am not too sure he would be\n\n\nIt is the subsequent inspection that I am referring to\n\n\nYes I believe he has a report\n\n<$B> \n\nNo no my Lord\n\n<$C> \n\nOkay\n\n\nWere any defects were you informed of any defects to the pick-up\n\n<$B> \n\nThere is no defect my Lord\n\n<$C> \n\nI don't know whether my learned friend will agree\n\n\nUnless my learned friend objects to the admission of that document\n\n\nPerhaps we could have it\n\n\nOf the inspection report\n\n\nWe could have it admitted and save the calling of the witness\n\n<$A> \n\nI have no objection your Honour\n\n<$C> \n\nSorry\n\n\nI think may be he has a copy\n\n\nCould you show your honour the copy of the inspection report of\nthe whatever report you have\n\n\nWe will make copies of it afterwards your Honour\n\n\nCould that be admitted\n\n\nI think that's all your Honour\n\n<$A> \n\nSergeant even though you arrived at the scene about an hour\nafter the accident the scene was preserved by the first police officer who\narrived from Jurong Police

group leader\n\n\nWe also don't have assistant group leader\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat was the nature of the work of this group leader\n\n<$B> \n\nNo no\n\n\nIt is basically the same and after this group leader is production\nassistant\n\n<$A> \n\nProduction assistant\n\n\nWas this Ernest as you were saying\n\n<$B> \n\nYes yes so\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd below that\n\n<$B> \n\nBelow that it will be workers\n\n\nSo my policy at that time is if you my policy at that time is\n\n\nIt is not uh my policy\n\n\nIn fact it is the company policy\n\n\nIf you come in without any primary education you join as a worker\n\n\nIf you got O level you join in as P A\n\n\nSo from there we assess you and we try to promote you\n\n\nAnd I would like to tell you that Ernest was one of the more bright\none\n\n\nEven if if he never resign today maybe he might be assistant\nsupervisor\n\n\nAnd in fact he never resigned\n\n\nIn fact I sacked him because of he absent for two weeks\n\n<$A> \n\nCorrect that is besides the point\n\n\nNow what I'm asking you is Ernest placed in charge of one section\nalone or what is the relationship to you\n\n\nThe relationship vis-a-vis you and Ernest in the job in this colour\nsection\n\n<$B> \n\nYes everything he have to report to me because at that time I\nwas training him to be the assistant group leader\n\n<$A> \n\nSo normally in the production side where these plates are\nbeing removed there would have been a ring leader as you call it or leader\ngroup leader as you call it\n\n\nSupervising this assistant supervisor or whoever you said is it\n\n\nIs there one position for group leader\n\n\nNormally what would be who would be supervising this group leader\nthis assistant production\n\n<$B> \n\nMyself is the supervisor\n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n\nAnd if there is a group leader what duty is his\n\n<$B> \n\nBasically what he do is he will do the same thing like the\nproduction assistant only the title only meaning the title\n\n\nExample let's say Ernest is the group leader and if I take another\nnewcomer he got O level so he is also a production assistant\n\n\nSo the only thing is the seniority problem\n\n<$A> \n\nAt that time how many assistant supervisors did the company\nhave\n\n<$B> \n\nThere is no assistant supervisor\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no in the position as Ernest\n\n\nErnest was assistant\n\n<$B> \n\nHe was a P A production assistant\n\n<$A> \n\nProduction assistant\n\n\nHow many of such persons were employed\n\n<$B> \n\nHe is the only one\n\n<$A> \n\nHe is the only one\n\n<$B> \n\nYes and plus the Q C\n\n\nQ C\n\n\nThere is two for Q C\n\n<$A> \n\nQ C\n\n<$B> \n\nTwo production assistant for Q C\n\n<$A> \n\nThat is a different section\n\n<$B> \n\nYa but it is under me\n\n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nSo in this section of colour matching where these moulds these\nplates are being taken\n\n\nWas this Ernest the only person who was in charge of both these\nmachines\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd where were you stationed normally\n\n\nWhat was does your duty require you to be around this machine as\nit's functioning or\n\n<$B> \n\nNot necessary because my office is on the second floor it's on\nthe second floor and this machine is in the production floor\n\n\nSo I have to walk quite a distance and the nature of the work is\nthat every morning every morning he is briefed what he have to do\n\n\nWhat I want him to do\n\n<$A> \n\nErnest's been briefed\n\n<$B> \n\nYah he's being briefed\n\n\nSo he have to do what he's told\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd Ernest gets the workers to do the work is it\n\n<$B> \n\nBasically he do it himself\n\n\nAt that time he was alone I think\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd you see the Plaintiff says at the time of the accident he\nwas already into the job of removing plates\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nThis was done with your knowledge wasn't it\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nYou knew that he was doing that job\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n\nBut I transfer him out in August\n\n\nSomewhere in August\n\n<$A> \n\nAugust nineteen eighty five\n\n<$B> \n\nNineteen eighty five\n\n<$A> \n\nOut from where\n\n<$B> \n\nFrom Q C\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no I'm now referring to the section to the time he was\nalready in the colour matching section\n\n\nNow witness so who then if he has any complaints or anything\n\n\nWho does he refer to Ernest\n\n<$B> \n\nEither one\n\n\nHe can refer to Ernest he can refer to me\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd normally who gives the orders to the Plaintiff\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause he's quite new in the section so normally I go\nthrough Ernest\n\n<$A> \n\nYou go through Ernest\n\n<$B> \n\nYes yes because if I go through him I am bypassing Ernest\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd in between this production of this colour plates\n\n\nWould Ernest be required to show the sample as and when they\nproduce times the sample of the plate to you to confirm whether they can\nproceed with the production\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd on the day of the accident the Plaintiff says that it was\nwhile Ernest was going upstairs to the office to show either you or somebody\nelse\n\n\nI'm not sure the plate that he was told to carry on and he did\n\n\nSo could you remember Ernest coming to you with the plate\n\n<$B> \n\nWell anyway I don't see him\n\n<$A> \n\nYou didn't see him\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nYou didn't see Ernest\n\n<$B> \n\nAt that time I believe it is only a few minutes difference\n\n\nThe time of accident is two o'clock\n\n\nSo normally my lunch break is twelve forty to one twenty\n\n\nAt one twenty the siren will go on and during this lunch break\nmost of the worker will be sleeping or resting\n\n\nSo I don't see them starting to work at about one forty five\nbecause they will take their time to wash their face go to the loo you know\n\n<$A> \n\nSo on that day of the incident you don't remember Ernest\ncoming to see you with the plate\n\n<$B> \n\nNo no\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd at the time of the accident\n\n\nNow the Plaintiff says the accident was at one forty five and this\nwas not disputed\n\n\nYou were not at the scene of the accident\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nNow witness\n\n\nSince you know much about this machine\n\n\nCan you confirm that the machine as it works in the normal sense\nwhen the gate guard remains open the mould the moving mould should remain\nstationary\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd do you agree with me also if at all the moving mould has\nmoved there must be something faulty about the machine\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't think when the gate is open the mould can move\n\n\nNot to my knowledge\n\n<$A> \n\nSo from your opinion in normal conditions the mould should\nnot move\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nNow witness\n\n\nWhat is the function of the two switches one at the rear and one\nin the front\n\n\nWhat is the function of the switches\n\n<$B> \n\nWe call it a something like a relay switch\n\n\nSo the function is to cut off the front one\n\n\nIf the gate get contact with the front one that means the circuit\nis on\n\n\nSo if you finish your process you open the door and the back touch\nthe switch on the back the circuit should be cut off\n\n<$A> \n\nCorrect\n\n\nSo as one opens the guard gate it should establish contact with\nthe rear switch and then the circuit should be cut off and the mould should\nbe stationary\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nNow witness\n\n\nYou said that after the accident people like Ernest refused to\ntouch the machine\n\n\nErnest in your own words was an experienced worker\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nHow long has he been working with that company before that\n\n<$B> \n\nMaybe two years\n\n<$A> \n\nDid you not tell him why is he refusing to work\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause the reason I\n\n\nOf course everybody feel very upset about the accident and I\nwouldn't want to you know to question him why he don't want to use\n\n\nIt might be due to you know all the skin and the flesh are stick\non the mould\n\n\nYou have to consider that\n\n\nWhen the hand was crushed all the skin and some of the bones got\nstuck on the mould and nobody want to clean it\n\n<$A> \n\nWitness please\n\n\nYou see your evidence before the Court was that nobody wanted to\nwork on that machine\n\n\nAnd then to relay their fear or something like that you had to\ncall this engineer from this Miki company\n\n\nNow what I'm asking you is this\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I never asked him what fear he had\n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n\nYou didn't ask him\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n\nSo as a supervisor I presume that my assessment is that maybe\nbecause of the bones and the skin got stuck there\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no\n\n\nWe're not asking for your presumption\n\n\nWe're asking you what you know\n\n\nNow witness the inspector from the Ministry of Labour Mister\nLawrence Chew who gave evidence earlier said that he was told by Mister Tan\nBoon Keng\n\n\nThis Mister Tan Boon Keng was he the assistant production manager\nthen\n\n<$B> \n\nAt that time yes\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd you were\n\n\nHe was higher in office than yourself\n\n<$B> \n\nHe's more superior than me\n\n<$A> \n\nHe was more superior than you\n\n\nAnd he was the officer who was present at the time the officers\nfrom the Ministry of Labour came to inspect the machine\n\n<$B> \n\nYes because at that time I was not available\n\n<$A> \n\nWitness\n\n\nYou said later on the engineer recommended that two more switches\n\n<$B> \n\nNot two\n\n\nOne\n\n<$A> \n\nOne switch\n\n\nOne more switch be put on the Miki machine\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n\nOn the front side\n\n<$A> \n\nOn the front side\n\n\nDid you all put that switch\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nWhen was this switch installed\n\n<$B> \n\nA few months later\n\n<$A> \n\nFew months later\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nWas it recommended for safety reasons to ensure that the\nguard doesn't close\n\n<$B> \n\nNo the guard will close\n\n\nSo why this Japanese engineer recommend\n\n\nI'm not very sure why he recommend the additional switch on the\nfront side\n\n<$A> \n\nYou are not sure why\n\n<$B> \n\nI'm not sure\n\n<$A> \n\nThis Mister Tan Boon Keng\n\n\nWhere is he now\n\n\nIs he employed with the company\n\n<$B> \n\nNo he already left two years ago\n\n\nSorry three years ago\n\n<$A> \n\nDo you know where he is now\n\n<$B> \n\nHe is in Singapore\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know his whereabouts\n\n<$B> \n\nRoughly yes\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know\n\n\nWhere do you think he's residing\n\n<$B> \n\nSomewhere near my place\n\n<$A> \n\nSomewhere near your place\n\n\nThat would be\n\n\nThat would be what address you know\n\n<$B> \n\nMaybe\n\n\nI don't know the address but somewhere in Bukit Batok\n\n<$A> \n\nBut you know his address you would be able to get that\n\n<$B> \n\nNo no\n\n\nI call him\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know his telephone number\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat is his telephone number sorry", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "20b45dbd-68fb-4575-8185-7f21a8b34c2c", "added":

had seven applications to develop\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd how did you come to know Mister Shaw Hui Jeong\n\n<$B> \n\nAutomated Systems the company that sold us the hardware\nrecommended Mister Shaw to us because he had experience in developing\nsoftware for the P D P Platform\n\n\nSoftware for that type of computers\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n\nSo in view of the recommendation and Mister Shaw's experience

of\nthe T I S and accounting systems on our P D P one one three four as per your\nletter dated sixth June eighty\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nThat's correct\n\n\nNow that project with S I S I R's finance company approved\n\n\nWould you describe that as a major project\n\n<$B> \n\nYes it took ultimately about two years to complete\n\n<$A> \n\nIt took two years to complete\n\n<$B>

of\nTechnical Information Service\n\n\nThat's T I S is it\n\n<$B> \n\nT I S yes\n\n<$A> \n\nComputerisation of T I S and how many accounting applications\n\n<$B> \n\nSix applications\n\n<$A> \n\nSix

Datatronics agree to provide\n\n<$B> \n\nThey were supposed to provide a systems designer and a\nprogrammer and S I S I R\n\n<$A> \n\nSystems designer and programmer\n\n\nCan you remember the different aspects which the project covered\n\n<$B> \n\nYes you have to start it off with a systems study and then\nthis\n\n<$A> \n\nInvestigation\n\n<$B> \n\nInvestigation followed by the systems specifying specifying\nthe system and the design of the system\n\n\nThen you went on to the actual programming testing and integration\nof all the\n\n\nSorry\n\n\nTesting and\n\n\nDesign\n\n<$A> \n\nDesigning programming testing and integration\n\n<$A> \n\nFile conversion from existing systems\n\n<$B> \n\nFrom existing manual system and writing the user\ndocumentation and the system documentation\n\n<$A> \n\nIncluding manuals\n\n<$B> \n\nYes manuals\n\n\nUser manuals\n\n\nManuals\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd documentation\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd documentation\n\n\nTraining of the users and also

run\n\n<$A> \n\nThat's all included in\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nAll included in the project\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n\nManual and the yes together\n\n\nTo make sure that everything is okay\n\n\nThat the outputs you know tally with what you have manual records\n\n<$A> \n\nNow throughout the whole project\n\n\nWhom did you deal with in Datatronics\n\n<$B> \n\nMister Shaw\n\n<$A> \n\nWho was in charge of that project\n\n<$B> \n\nHe was the project manager\n\n<$A> \n\nHe was the project manager\n\n<$B> \n\nMm and also the systems designer\n\n<$A> \n\nSystems designer\n\n<$B> \n\nRight\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd all discussions and negotiations for the purchase of the\nsystem were with whom in Datatronics\n\n<$B> \n\nWith Mister Shaw\n\n<$A> \n\nWith Mr Shaw\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nAll discussions negotiations with him alone\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nHow often did he attend the office of S I S I R\n\n<$B> \n\nWhen we first started off the project\n\n\nWhen we were doing specification and design and a lot of the\ntechnical work initially it was almost every day\n\n\nThen as the project progressed and it was more programming you\nknow and programming and testing\n\n\nThen he comes in when we have technical problems that need solving\n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd also to oversee you know\n\n\nOversee as a project manager to oversee it\n\n\nSo he came in maybe two or three times a week\n\n<$A> \n\nTwo or three times a week\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nWhen he attended your office\n\n\nWhat were the office hours or what were the hours he kept\n\n<$B> \n\nNine to five\n\n\nBut if there are problems and we had to solve them\n\n\nThen we would stay on till nine or ten until you know\n\n<$A> \n\nNine or ten at night\n\n<$B> \n\nUntil we get the problem solved or we are too tired\n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n\nCan you remember roughly what his responsibilities were his\nfunctions\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n\nMainly he was the project manager the systems designer\n\n\nHe would you know oversee all the programming testing and\nintegration\n\n\nHe wrote the first drafts of all the functional specifications\n\n\nFirst drafts of all the functional specifications\n\n\nYes\n\n\nThen later on as you know\n\n\nAs the specifications developed\n\n\nThen he vetted you know all the enhancements of the specifications\n\n\nAnd he also came in to solve technical problems related to you\nknow\n\n\nAll these aspects programming and testing\n\n<$A> \n\nNow Miss Sng\n\n<$B> \n\nand\n\n<$A> \n\nI'm sorry\n\n\nI beg your pardon\n\n<$B> \n\nI think initial training of the users and he was also\ninvolved in that\n\n<$A> \n\nTraining of users of the system\n\n<$B> \n\nTraining of users of the computerized system\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n\nNow you knew that Mister Shaw left Datatronics in May eighty two\n\n<$B> \n\nEighty two yes\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat was the state of the what was the progress then\n\n<$B> \n\nWe had one more application you know to develop\n\n<$A> \n\nOne more application\n\n<$B> \n\nOne more application\n\n<$A> \n\nTo develop\n\n<$B> \n\nTo develop\n\n\nThe last one\n\n\nIt was\n\n\nYes job costing\n\n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nDid Datatronics after he left\n\n\nDid Datatronics complete\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n\nWe did not have anyone to replace him as a system designer and\nproject manager\n\n\nAnd the assigned programmer was also away from the job\n\n\nDid not show up five\n\n\nAnd project manager to replace Mister Shaw\n\n\nAnd the assigned programmer was away from the job\n\n\nI think the last five out of the last six weeks\n\n\nSo at that point and time we decided to terminate you know the\ncontract\n\n<$A> \n\nYou terminated the contract\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n\nAnd because it was not satisfactorily completed\n\n\nTen thousand I think was withheld as penalty for non-completion\n\n<$A> \n\nTen thousand\n\n<$B> \n\nTen thousand\n\n<$A> \n\nSo you are saying that Datatronics failed to assign a proper\n\n<$B> \n\nReplacement for Mister Shaw\n\n<$A> \n\nReplacement for Mister Shaw\n\n\nAnd after he left Datatronics did S I S I R have any further\nbusiness with Mister Shaw\n\n<$B> \n\nYes he\n\n\nWhen I had problems I still you know contacted him and he advised\nus on an informal basis\n\n\nThen when he started his own company we contracted with him to do\nfurther enhancements on the applications\n\n<$A> \n\nFurther enhancements on\n\n<$B> \n\nOn the applications\n\n<$A> \n\nOn the applications\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n\nThe seven applications that was\n\n<$A> \n\nComputerised applications\n\n<$B> \n\nYes that was nineteen eighty three to eighty five period yes\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd are those computerised applications still in operation\ntoday\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nNo further questions my Lord\n\n<$C> \n\nNow Miss Sng\n\n\nYou said that you knew the Plaintiff as Mister Shaw as the project\nmanager and system designer\n\n\nDid you know whether he was a director or partner or employee of\nthe company Datatronics\n\n<$B> \n\nWe considered him as you know in charge of the whole company\nbecause he was the person we dealt with\n\n<$A> \n\nI didn't quite get the last bit\n\n<$B> \n\nWe considered him

\n\nYes\n\n\nYou told this Court they were consistent with injuries sustained by\nclimbing coconut trees\n\n\nNow would you agree with me these injuries in the region of the\nabdomen would be consistent with fisting on the patient's abdomen by a person\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n\nThese are superficial abrasions on the skin injuries that you\nwould sustain when you scrape your skin against a rough surface and not a\nfist\n\n<$A> \n\nDoctor I am referring to two B abrasions over the epigastric\nregion\n\n<$B> \n\nRight yes\n\n<$A> \n\nNow\n\n\nDid you pay attention to the appearance of this

like\n\n\nDid you take it\n\n<$B> \n\nFifty-three per minute\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd would you describe that as normal\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nDoctor\n\n\nThe average pulse rate is around seventy seventy two isn't it\n\n<$B> \n\nThat is just an average heart rate but it is a wide range\nfrom fifty to about one hundred depending on your emotional state on your\nphysical fitness\n\n\nFor somebody who has been doing manual work I would assume his\nphysical status to be pretty healthy and fit\n\n\nSportsmen have been known to have pulse rate of thirty to forty\nbeats per minute\n\n\nSo fifty three beats per minute to me is normal\n\n<$A> \n\nI have no further questions\n\n<$C> \n\nSir I have watched the cross-examination of my learned friend\n\n\nAnd to the extent of the dialogue they had as to the difficulties\nin communication\n\n\nI would wish to adopt that part of it\n\n<$C> \n\nI would just like to put in a few more questions of my own\n\n<$C> \n\nDoctor Pua my clients says he doesn't speak English\n\n\nHe has difficulty in communicating in English\n\n<$B> \n\nDoes he speak not even a word of English\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$C> \n\nDoctor Pua\n\n\nLooking at this report\n\n\nI would put it to you that you did not obtain history from my\nclient\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat do you mean\n\n<$C> \n\nOn the record that you have in page forty six\n\n<$C> \n\nCan you have a look at page twenty\n\n\nSorry you are looking at a different report\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$C> \n\nThat is the one who is my client\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$C> \n\nNow you examined him on the first of February eighty eight at\neleven fifty seven hours\n\n\nYou put down there he claimed that his right index and middle\nfingers were bitten by the deceased on twenty first February eighty eight\n\n<$B> \n\nWhere did I get the history that his right index and middle\nfingers\n\n<$C> \n\nThat's right\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's from him\n\n<$C> \n\nSo whatever barriers you may have had in communication you\nmanaged to overcome and come to this conclusion\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n\nI can't remember how I got the history including that of the road\ntraffic accident\n\n<$C> \n\nDoctor Pua\n\n\nYou mentioned here that the fingers were bitten by the deceased\n\n\nHow did you know that the deceased was involved\n\n<$B> \n\nThe patient came with an accompanied form where he had to\nfill in\n\n\nAnd there is a short little history there\n\n<$C> \n\nCan you come to that please\n\n\nCan you read out that short little history\n\n\nRead out the whole thing\n\n<$B> \n\nOn the thirty first of January nineteen eighty-eight at about\nnine P M subject was arrested at number twenty-six Mandai Lake Road for an\noffence of murder which was committed on the twenty second of January\nnineteen eighty eight at Jalan Kampong Chantek\n\n\nPlease examine subject for old scars injuries and also any fresh\ninjuries as he is about to give a statement to the police under the\nprovisions of section one hundred and twenty two point six C P C\n\n\nHe claimed that his fingers were bitten by the deceased and also\nhad a fall in injuring his knees\n\n<$C> \n\nSo in fact you were given a preview preliminary instructions\n\n<$B> \n\nBrief details\n\n\nYes\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd basically this was what you have there\n\n<$B> \n\nJust this section\n\n\nYes\n\n<$C> \n\nDoctor Pua Phua you were in the company of a person who was\napparently a murderer and you were only with a nurse a lady nurse\n\n\nYou were conducting an examination on a person who was suspected\nof being a murderer and you were only in the company of a lady nurse\n\n<$B> \n\nI only remember that there was a nurse because that is\nroutine\n\n\nI don't remember whether there were other people in the room\n\n<$B> \n\nWhether it was a lady nurse\n\n\nOh I can't remember whether the nurse was a lady or a male\n\n<$C> \n\nSo sorry it was a presumption on my part\n\n\nWhen I heard the word nurse I presumed a lady\n\n\nIn the examination that you made\n\n\nIf understand you correctly when you do the examination\n\n\nYou examine your patient from head to toe and he is naked\n\n<$B> \n\nCorrect\n\n<$C> \n\nWould the exact procedure be adopted in my client's case\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$C> \n\nComing to the injuries marked as two A and two B\n\n\nThese were consistent with being bitten about eight or ten days\nprior to your examination\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd the injury two F\n\n\nThese are consistent with a traffic accident in Bangladesh in\nnineteen seventy-six\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$C> \n\nThat would put them about twelve years old because you\nexamined him in nineteen eighty-eight\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$C> \n\nDoctor Pua did you also observe whether your patient had any\nmobility in his right arm\n\n\nAnything in your card or observation notes\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n\nI did note that his right deltoid muscle\n\n\nThis muscle over here is wasted\n\n<$C> \n\nIt is wasted\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$C> \n\nSo there would be an absence of some strength in that arm\n\n<$B> \n\nThere would be some absence\n\n\nYes\n\n<$C> \n\nIs dexterity also affected\n\n<$B> \n\nNot fully because\n\n\nAre you talking about\n\n<$C> \n\nLike swinging for example\n\n\nLike going bowling or climbing coconut trees or anything else\n\n<$B> \n\nYes yes\n\n\nIt would be partially affected\n\n<$C> \n\nDoctor I would like to take you now to the report

experience as a medical practitioner a scar I\nmean if it is a superficial scar\n\n\nHow long would it take to heal\n\n<$B> \n\nAbout a week or so\n\n<$C> \n\nWere these scars deep\n\n<$B>

\n\nYes\n\n\nIt is dated third of September eighty-seven is it\n\n<$A> \n\nHave you made extra copies\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nI have extra copies my Lords\n\n\nThese were given to us at the commencement of the trial\n\n<$A> \n\nPreliminary Report one hundred and twenty-six my Lords\n\n\nDoctor this report was made on the third of September nineteen\neighty-six\n\n\nIs that right\n\n<$B> \n\nNineteen eighty-seven\n\n<$A> \n\nI am sorry nineteen eighty-seven\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nNow Doctor I would like you to explain the differences between\nyour initial report P one hundred and twenty-six and the final report that\nyou tendered P one hundred and eighteen\n\n\nCould you point out the differences to me\n\n<$B> \n\nI think the only difference the sense of it\n\n\nThe only difference was in my first report\n\n\nI commented that he is fit to stand trial\n\n\nThat he does not suffer from any mental disorder and fit to stand\ntrial\n\n\nAnd at the time of the alleged offence he was not of unsound mind\n\n\nThat was the conclusion of my first report because he was going for\ntrial and that was meant for the first trial for the Preliminary Inquiry\n\n\nNow in this at that point in time I made no mention of him not\nsuffering from any abnormality of mind because normally I think abnormality\nof mind is a decision to be made usually by the Court\n\n\nIt is not for the psychiatrist to make it out\n\n\nBut for this High Court trial this seems to be the issue and so I\nspecifically touched on it\n\n\nSo the difference between these two is one I commented\n\n\nFitness to stand trial and not touching not mentioning abnormality\nof mind that part of it\n\n\nAnd on this one I did not mention to stand trial\n\n\nI just talked about no mental illness and not of unsound mind and\nno abnormality of mind arising from those conditions\n\n\nSo I think in this sense that is the difference\n\n\nThe other things the minor things about family history I think\nthere are some\n\n\nBecause of course in this trial I have heard more things and I have\nincorporated more things\n\n\nThey are for two different purposes\n\n\nIn fact even when I prepared the first report if it is going to be\na High Court trial\n\n\nAnother report will be submitted\n\n<$A> \n\nDoctor in your initial report you did not consider the issue\nas to whether there was any abnormality of mind of subject the Accused\n\n<$B> \n\nI did not mention it in the report\n\n<$A> \n\nNeither did you consider it\n\n\nThat's my point\n\n<$B> \n\nI considered it but I did not include it in the report\n\n\nAs I said the question of abnormality of mind and diminished\nresponsibility is something to be raised not by the psychiatrist\n\n\nIt is a decision to be made by the Court\n\n<$A> \n\nDoctor if you will just confine your answer to my question I\nthink we can move along quite fast\n\n\nMy question is did you consider it at the time when you prepared\nthe initial report\n\n\nDoctor did you consider the issue of abnormality of mind\n\n<$B> \n\nOf course I had considered but it was not relevant to my\nreport and I did not include it in my report\n\n<$A> \n\nJust say you did\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I did\n\n\nI did\n\n<$A> \n\nIn your final report did you also consider the issue of\nabnormality of mind\n\n<$B> \n\nMy final report\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nOf course\n\n<$A> \n\nYou considered it this time and you specifically mentioned\nthat there was no abnormality of mind\n\n<$B> \n\nYes arising from those conditions\n\n\nArising from the rest of the developments and so on\n\n<$A> \n\nOne essential difference between your initial report and your\nfinal report was that when you prepared the final report P one hundred and\neighteen you had by then the evidence adduced at the trial\n\n<$B> \n\nYes my Lords\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd you specifically mentioned it in paragraph B of P one\nhundred and eighteen\n\n<$B> \n\nYes my Lords\n\n<$A> \n\nNow Doctor Ang at that time when you prepared the Preliminary\nReport\n\n\nOn what basis did you consider whether or not there was any\nabnormality of mind\n\n<$B> \n\nOn the basis of the history that he gave me\n\n\nOn the basis of the observations of his behaviour\n\n\nHis narration of events of what happened from the moment of his own\ndescription of the events until the moment when he tried to shoot himself\n\n\nSo I think based on all that in other words on no occasion at no\ntime was there evidence that he was abnormal arising from all those\nconditions\n\n\nI think that was based on my examination of him\n\n\nOn what basis\n\n\nOn my examination of him and that's my conclusion\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd what he told you was reflected in the clinical notes that\nyou recorded\n\n<$B> \n\nYes the sequence of events and the\n\n<$A> \n\nWhich at no time mentioned anything about the delusion or the\npossible delusion that he was a hero in the Shanghai Bank\n\n<$B> \n\nYes there was no mention of it because I know\n\n<$A> \n\nJust yes or no and then we can go on\n\n<$B> \n\nNo no\n\n<$A> \n\nDoctor Ang when you prepared the final report twenty-eight of\nFebruary\n\n\nBy then it had transpired in this Court that there was evidence of\nthe Accused's claim to this delusion when he was the hero in Shanghai Bank\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nBy then you would have heard the evidence transpiring in Court\nfor a number of days already\n\n<$B> \n\nOf what\n\n\nOf the delusion\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's what he claimed\n\n<$A> \n\nYes but you have heard in Court\n\n<$B> \n\nCorrect\n\n<$A> \n\nThis evidence which had been going on for a number of days\nalready\n\n<$B> \n\nI heard this being brought up but then there is the other\nevidence from all the other people\n\n<$A> \n\nWe will come to that doctor but just answer my question\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n\nI heard that\n\n<$A> \n\nOtherwise we will go on for time immemorial\n\n\nIsn't it a fact Doctor Ang that that evidence of the Accused's\nclaim to this delusion had transpired in this Court for a number of days\nalready\n\n<$B> \n\nYes it is a fact that he said it\n\n\nThat yes I accept that but\n\n<$A> \n\nIt is a fact that he said it\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's right\n\n<$A> \n\nIn examination-in-chief\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nIt is a fact that he was cross-examined by my Learned Friend\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nSeverely on this point\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nIt is a fact that the Prosecution had given evidence of his\nstatement to the Investigating Officer about his claim Doctor Ang\n\n<$B> \n\nNot the delusion that he imagined\n\n<$A> \n\nAll right that he imagined\n\n\nIt was a fact by then that you also had Doctor Nagulendran's\nreport about this delusion\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nWouldn't you agree Doctor Ang that the central issue in this\ncase is whether or not there was such a delusion\n\n<$B> \n\nYes together with the claim that he was suffering I think\nfrom a major depression\n\n<$A> \n\nIsn't the evidence and the claims the arguments pertaining to\nthis point the central issue in our case\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nWouldn't you agree Doctor Ang that perhaps the case turns on\nthe findings of the Court in respect of this issue\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nNow that being the case\n\n\nIf I may refer you to your own report P one hundred and eighteen\n\n\nyou did not even make a single reference to that testimony\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I did not make reference to it agreed\n\n<$A> \n\nYou didn't refer to that at all\n\n\nBe it a delusion or imagination or a claim or a fact\n\n\nYou made absolutely no reference to that whatsoever in your report\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I did not make any reference to it\n\n<$A> \n\nIn fact doctor in your so-called final report which you\nclaimed you took into consideration the evidence adduced at the trial\n\n\nYou left out this issue which you admit to be central to the\nentire proceedings completely out of your report\n\n<$B> \n\nI considered it\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't care whether you considered\n\n\nDid you or did you not leave it out in your report Doctor Ang\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I left it out\n\n<$A> \n\nThat's all I want you to say\n\n\nDoctor Ang would you not agree with me that any person not sitting\nin this Court listening to this trial and has the benefit only of your report\nwill probably get the impression that no such thing ever transpired in Court\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n\nIt would just be that in spite of my having listened to the\nevidence which has been adduced in Court I had not included it because there\nwas no evidence\n\n<$A> \n\nDoctor Ang I hadn't asked why you left it out so please\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I have to explain it\n\n<$A> \n\nI will give you more than ample chance to explain Doctor Ang\n\n\nYou'll have the floor\n\n\nMy question is very simple\n\n\nYou are a very experienced man Doctor Ang\n\n\nA man's life is at stake\n\n\nA boy's life is at stake Doctor Ang\n\n\nAny person would you not agree with me Doctor Ang\n\n\nAny person not knowing what transpired in court reading your\nreport will conclude that no such testimony was ever given in this Court\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nDoctor Ang any person who does not know what happened in his\nCourt reading your report will not have the slightest idea that the Accused\nhad given testimony that I was deluded as the hero in Shanghai Bank\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n\nAnyone reading it would not have this sort of information yes\n\n<$A> \n\nAnyone reading this also Doctor Ang will not know that for\ndays we were here arguing on this point\n\n<$B> \n\nYes but\n\n<$A> \n\nPlease save the but\n\n\nYou will have time for your buts\n\n\nDoctor Ang anybody just reading your report will have no inkling\nwhatsoever about that point\n\n\nDon't you agree with me Doctor\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n\nI agree fully\n\n<$A> \n\nThat anybody reading your report would have a serious gap in\nthe nature of the case and the nature of the evidence and the nature of the\ntestimony that transpired\n\n<$B> \n\nBut the outcome of the case is to be decided by the Lordships\nnot by any person reading it\n\n<$A> \n\nYes I agree\n\n\nI will come to why you said that\n\n\nBut anybody reading this will probably conclude that no such thing\never happened in this Court\n\n\nIs it not Doctor Ang\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nDo you think it is fair for you to make a report like this\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n\nI think the report reflects my opinion on the matter and I'll be\ngiving evidence in Court before the Lordships\n\n\nSo anything could always be raised\n\n<$A> \n\nDoctor Ang you earlier said that page one hundred and\neighteen reflects your opinion\n\n<$B> \n\nYes my conclusions\n\n\nIt reflects my conclusions\n\n<$A> \n\nOn the testimony that was given in Court\n\n<$B> \n\nYes my Lords\n\n<$A> \n\nIs it fair therefore a central issue to be ignored by you\n\n<$B> \n\nI never ignored it\n\n\nIt was considered\n\n<$A> \n\nIgnored in this report Doctor Ang\n\n\nAll I am saying is\n\n<$B> \n\nNot argued out in the report but it was certainly considered\nbut I concluded\n\n<$A> \n\nBut did any person reading this report\n\n\nDid you express any opinion on this particular fact\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n\nIt is although not stated\n\n\nBut the conclusion covers that aspect of my formulation of my\nthinking\n\n<$A> \n\nHow how how could your conclusion be based on a fact that you\ndidn't mention\n\n<$B> \n\nNo these facts had been brought out\n\n<$A> \n\nDoctor Ang explain to us your mental process\n\n\nHow you can formulate an opinion without a reference to a fact\n\n<$B> \n\nOf course the fact that it was not written that the argument\nwas not set out in the report does not mean that\n\n<$A> \n\nIt wasn't not argued not set out in the report\n\n\nYou described the antecedents and precedents\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's right\n\n\nIn fact very briefly I described I did not go into great details\nand I think what matters most was my conclusion and I would be answerable to\nthe Court to explain how I came to such a conclusion\n\n\nNow whether a person outside reading it is aware of the whole\nproceedings or not I don't think it really matters Coomaraswamy:-\n\n<$A> \n\nMay it please your Lordship \n\n\nNow Doctor please refer to page three of P one hundred and\neighteen your final report under the heading of Antecedents to the Incident\n\n\nHave you got it\n\n<$B> \n\nYes my Lord\n\n<$A> \n\nDoctor by this you meant it is your account as to the events\nleading to the incident\n\n<$B> \n\nThis is a very brief summary of the events leading to it\n\n<$A> \n\nBrief nevertheless but as far as you were concerned these\nwere events leading to the incident as you saw it\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nWould you agree with me Doctor that nowhere in your report\ndid you mention about the Accused taking the two revolvers with him\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n\nI left it out\n\n\nIn fact this account is based very much on my interview with him\nand also probably supplemented by the things I heard in Court and also a\nlittle bit of background information I obtained from Inspector Ng's summary\n\n\nSo it is only meant just as an introduction outlining the summary\nof events relevant events\n\n<$A> \n\nRight\n\n\nThese were events which you saw as relevant in your summary\n\n<$B> \n\nYes", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "8433e1d4-c63a-43c6-be07-b165a99e712d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.601435+00:00"}

\n\nYou are taking Doctor Wee through the external injuries\n\n<$A> \n\nThrough all the slash wounds and stab wounds and with reference to\nthe photographs\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nFirst injury on your medical report\n\n\nDoctor Wee could you take a look\n\n<$C> \n\nYes this is seen in P thirty-one\n\n<$B> \n\nP thirty-one\n\n\nSuperficial cut on left forehead is it\n\n<$A> \n\nThis is a cut on the face around the eye and down to the cheek\n\n\nOn the face right\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nThe one you see in P thirty-one\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nComing down the nose is it\n\n<$C> \n\nInner aspect of the left\n\n<$B> \n\nInner aspect of the left eye all right\n\n<$A> \n\nThat is the first injury\n\n\nThis would be consistent Doctor Wee with\n\n\nWould it be consistent with injury caused by a sharp object\n\n<$C> \n\nSharp instrument\n\n<$A> \n\nSuch as a parang\n\n<$C> \n\nYes the tip of the parang\n\n<$A> \n\nThe second injury Doctor Wee is a slash wound with sharp edges\nand forked anterior tip over the occipita-parietal scalp where would that\n\n<$C> \n\nThis is seen in P thirty-four and thirty-five\n\n<$A> \n\nP thirty-four shows the injury with the hair still on his head\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd P thirty thirty-five with the head shaved\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nCould you briefly describe this wound to us\n\n\nIt has not penetrated the skull\n\n\nIt did not crack the skull or\n\n<$C> \n\nIt did not go into the skull cavity or affected the brain\n\n<$A> \n\nBut it has cut through the skin and flesh of the head \nuntil it reaches the skull\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n\nIt only cut the thickness of the scalp and outer table of the skullbone\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd this would also be consistent with the injuries caused\n\n<$C> \n\nBy a sharp instrument like that of parang\n\n<$A> \n\nThird injury Doctor Wee is an tangential slash wound\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n\nThis is seen in P thirty-five\n\n<$A> \n\nP thirty-five also\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd thirty-three\n\n<$A> \n\nThis is where part of the scalp being slashed off\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nOne moment P\n\n<$A> \n\nThirty-three and thirty-five\n\n\nThirty-three is the injury\n\n<$B> \n\nSomewhere near the ear is it\n\n<$A> \n\nYes where part of the scalp is sliced off\n\n\nDoctor Wee could you see photographs eight and nine\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nWould that be the piece of scalp that had been sliced off\n\n<$C> \n\nYes it would\n\n<$A> \n\nMy Lord the scale in eight and nine was found in the hotelroom\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd this injury is again consistent with that caused by a sharp instrument\n\n<$C> \n\nLike that of a parang\n\n<$A> \n\nBefore I go on to the other I go on to the injuries first\n\n\nThe neck has no injuries\n\n<$C> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nThe injury on the chest\n\n\nThere is a vertical slash wound on the right anterior shoulder\nwith sharp edges\n\n\nWhere can you find this\n\n<$C> \n\nIt is seen in P thirty-five and thirty-one\n\n<$A> \n\nThere is a deep slash wound on the right shoulder isn't it\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nAgain sharp instrument\n\n<$A> \n\nSharp instrument\n\n<$C> \n\nYes a sharp instrument like that of a parang\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd there is the fifth injury on the report which is the \nfatal stab wound\n\n\nFifth injury fatal stab wound triangular stab wound left \nanterolateral mid-chest wall\n\n\nWhere can we find this\n\n<$C> \n\nP twenty-eight and thirty-one\n\n<$B> \n\nLet's look at it\n\n<$A> \n\nTwenty-eight shows about three stab wounds\n\n\nWhich of these\n\n<$C> \n\nThe one nearest the left nipple\n\n<$A> \n\nWould your Lordship want Doctor Wee to mark the injury\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n\nNear the nipple we can see that\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n\nAnd the same injury can also be seen my Lord in P\n\n<$B> \n\nThirty-one\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n\nIt is also near the left nipple\n\n<$B> \n\nCompared to the other injuries so far seen looking at the photograph \nit doesn't seem to be a very serious one\n\n\nBut I suppose Doctor Wee is going to explain to us\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nCould you describe to us the wound and tell us why it is the fatal wound\n\n<$C> \n\nThis is a triangular stab wound\n\n\nIt penetrated the full thickness of the chest wall\n\n\nIt went into the right side of the heart\n\n\nBecause there was penetration into the heart I considered that \nthis wound was the fatal wound\n\n<$A> \n\nThe most serious of\n\n<$C> \n\nThe most serious of the rest\n\n<$A> \n\nNow this wound Doctor Wee would be consistent with\n\n<$B> \n\nHow would you say this wound had been caused\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n\nWith what instrument would this wound be caused\n\n<$C> \n\nIt's caused by a sharp instrument which is triangular on cross-section\n\n<$A> \n\nSharp Doctor Wee means pointed as opposed to the sharpness of a parang\n\n\nThe edges of a parang\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nIt is a pointed instrument\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nSharp pointed instrument\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat he means is it's a pointed instrument\n\n<$C> \n\nA pointed\n\n<$A> \n\nSharp in that\n\n<$B> \n\nA pointed instrument\n\n\nCan you give us some examples\n\n<$C> \n\nPointed tip like a bearing scraper\n\n<$B> \n\nAnything else\n\n<$C> \n\nAny other sharp instrument that is triangular on cross-section\n\n<$B> \n\nCan you explain the expression triangular on cross-section\n\n<$C> \n\nThe blade if one were across and look at it it should be triangular\n\n<$B> \n\nIt is a cross-section\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nTaking a cross-section of it and when we look at it it \nis triangular in shape\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nSo it could be something like a\n\n<$C> \n\nBearing scraper\n\n<$A> \n\nA metal file\n\n\nA sharp metal file with a pointed tip which is triangular \nin shape would that\n\n<$C> \n\nYes it would\n\n<$A> \n\nWould that instrument be consistent with the wound caused \nby such an instrument\n\n<$B> \n\nA metal\n\n\nWhat did you say Mister\n\n<$A> \n\nA sharp pointed metal file with a triangular shape\n\n<$B> \n\nMetal file\n\n<$A> \n\nWith a triangular cross-section\n\n<$B> \n\nNo no\n\n\nLeave the cross-section alone\n\n<$C> \n\nModerate force\n\n<$A> \n\nModerate force was used\n\n\nYou need only a moderate force to penetrate with this \ntype of instrument\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd while we are still at this injury perhaps you can \ntell us from your observation\n\n\nWould an assailant who uses this instrument would he be\n\n\nWhich position would he be vis-a-vis the deceased\n\n\nWould you be able to tell us looking at the wound and the track\n\n<$C> \n\nMost likely to be a frontal\n\n<$B> \n\nFrontal attack\n\n<$A> \n\nFrontal attack yes\n\n\nWe go on to the next wound Doctor Wee\n\n\nBefore I go to the next wound this wound and the four other \nwounds which you have just described\n\n\nWould you say that they are caused by different instruments\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nIt cannot be the same instrument\n\n<$C> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nDefinitely a different instrument\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nIt was not a parang anyway\n\n<$C> \n\nNo\n\n<$B> \n\nThis fifth wound was not caused by a parang\n\n<$C> \n\nNo\n\n\nCould not have been\n\n<$B> \n\nThat explains the difference in the wounds as shown \nin the photographs\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nWound number six\n\n\nThis is also another stab wound\n\n\nRight anterolateral mid chest wall\n\n\nWhere can you find\n\n<$B> \n\nBefore you go to the sixth wound Mister Seng\n\n\nCan you ask him some questions on or would you be \ncoming back to it later as to the cause of death\n\n<$A> \n\nI will go through the wounds first and then\n\n<$B> \n\nAll right\n\n\nVery well\n\n<$A> \n\nSo that we have an idea of what the wounds are before\n\n<$B> \n\nVery well\n\n\nAnd because the witness said that is a fatal wound we \nwill come back to that later\n\n<$A> \n\nI'll be asking him about the other wound as well\n\n<$B> \n\nNow you are on the sixth wound\n\n\nYes where is it to be found\n\n<$A> \n\nWhere can you find the sixth wound Doctor Wee\n\n<$C> \n\nSorry the picture is not very clear\n\n\nIt is at the side of P thirty-one\n\n<$A> \n\nIt is very hard to see\n\n\nPerhaps you could mark the or show his Lordship \nwhere the wound is\n\n\nCircle it and mark number six\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n\nThat is the sixth wound P thirty-one\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd would you say that this wound could be caused by \nthe same instrument or similar instrument that has caused \nthe fifth wound\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nConsistent with the triangular sharp instrument\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nNot a parang\n\n<$C> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nNow the seventh wound which is a slash wound number seven\n\n\nWhere can you find this wound in the photographs\n\n<$C> \n\nP thirty-two\n\n<$A> \n\nThere are two\n\n\nThe one nearer the neck\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nThere are two wounds\n\n\nTwo very clear wounds\n\n<$B> \n\nYes nearer the armpit\n\n<$A> \n\nYes the one near the armpit\n\n<$B> \n\nThe bigger of the two wounds shown on the photograph\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n\nAnd this would he consistent with that caused by a parang\n\n<$C> \n\nYes a parang\n\n<$A> \n\nSlashed caused by a parang\n\n\nAnd the eighth slash wound\n\n<$C> \n\nIt is the one below the\n\n<$A> \n\nSeventh wound\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nThat is also consistent with that caused by a sharp \nobject like a parang\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n\nLike a parang\n\n<$A> \n\nThe ninth wound is a stab wound at the abdomen\n\n\nWhich photograph would that be\n\n<$C> \n\nP twenty-eight\n\n<$A> \n\nThere are three there\n\n<$C> \n\nThe one nearest the navel\n\n<$A> \n\nThe one in the centre yes\n\n\nHas your Lordship got it\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nThat is the ninth stab\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n\nThe other one is of course the fatal \nwound isn't it\n\n<$A> \n\nThat is at the nipple\n\n\nYes\n\n\nDoctor Wee my first question is taking the injuries as a \nwhole all the injuries\n\n\nIf the deceased had been rushed to hospital immediately \nwould he likely have been saved\n\n<$C> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nAny possibility\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat time frame are you speaking about Mr Tan\n\n<$A> \n\nImmediately after he sustained the injuries my Lord\n\n<$B> \n\nI know\n\n\nImmediately means within two minutes or ten minutes or what\n\n<$A> \n\nWithin ten minutes if he had been rushed to the hospital\n\n<$C> \n\nNot likely\n\n<$A> \n\nIs it a question of degree or is it simply improbable to \nsave his life\n\n<$C> \n\nImprobable\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd even if you are given half a day to treat him\n\n\nWould you be able to save his life\n\n<$B> \n\nSorry\n\n\nI didn't hear the question\n\n<$A> \n\nIf a team of doctors are given half a day to treat \nhis injuries would his life be saved\n\n<$C> \n\nUnlikely\n\n<$B> \n\nYou see the Doctor has already said if he was rushed \nto hospital within ten minutes he was unlikely to be saved\n\n\nHow could a team of doctors for half a day do anything better\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nCarry on\n\n<$A> \n\nI read in the report Doctor Wee the time of death was at \nzero zero forty-eight minutes\n\n<$B> \n\nAfter midnight\n\n\nForty-eight minutes after midnight\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nDoctor Wee could you tell the Court\n\n<$B> \n\nWhen did the ambulance arrive Mister Tan\n\n\nJust to follow your line of cross-examination\n\n<$A> \n\nThe ambulance arrived at about\n\n<$B> \n\nI think the ambulance arrived fairly quickly isn't it \nfrom the call\n\n<$A> \n\nAbout nine minutes\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later he was sent to the hospital\n\n<$B> \n\nThat is right\n\n\nThat is my recollection\n\n<$A> \n\nYes my Lord\n\n\nWhat I want to confirm is the time of death Doctor Wee\n\n\nWhere did you get the information from\n\n<$C> \n\nThis information was given to us on the police three \nzero three report\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd the medical officer in charge at the hospital must have\n\n<$C> \n\nCertified death\n\n<$A> \n\nNow do you have a copy of that certification here\n\n<$C> \n\nNo\n\n\nBut it was stated in the three zero three police report \nthat Doctor Meret certified death at zero zero

do buy from us uh\nis valid internationally\n\n\nShould you and your husband migrate or choose to work overseas uh\nthis plan is internationally valid\n\n\nAnd uh should something politically happen to Singapore you can\nstill claim your money outside Singapore alright\n\n\nNow you at the moment uh you you are married but you don't have any\nkids yet huh\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nNow there are some reasons why I ask that question\n\n\nNow this firstly this is a covering letter and this ex explains all\nthe concepts of our program here\n\n\nNow one what is very unusual about this plan is the parent-child\noption\n\n\nIf you for example next year if you choose to start a family now\nwhen your son reaches eighteen or twenty-one assuming you have a boy it can\nbe a girl but I'll just say boy\n\n\nIf if your son reaches eighteen or twenty-one if you don't want\nyour plan you can transfer it to your child\n\n\nSo when your child you transfer it to your child it's like a legacy\nthat you pass to your child\n\n\nSo your child at twenty-one will inherit your plan if you so wish\nto transfer to him but he will pay the rate of a small baby based on the year\nhe was born\n\n\nSo that's a tremendous cost-saving you see and it is also without\nevidence of insurability\n\n\nNow without evidence of insurability means that even if your child\nis born healthy but later on he develops a medical problem he can inherit\nyour plan you see\n\n\nNow this uh rider is given free to you and none of our competitors\nhave got this feature here\n\n\nNow the other feature that we have is the disability part\n\n\nUh uh I believe your husband is also with the varsity here\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nNow uh whatever occupation you're doing now if by injury or\naccident or disease due to sickness you can't do your current occupation we\nwill pay you the full sum insured over five years\n\n\nIf you buy from our competitors it's over ten years and you must be\nlike a complete vegetable you see\n\n\nSo this is the two different criterias\n\n\nUh now I'll I'll just explain to you the quantitative features then\nit's more easy for you you see\n\n\nWhat I've covered is just the uh just the brief concept\n\n\nNow this is a covering letter\n\n\nThese are the brochures\n\n\nNow this is the uh core program\n\n\nNow the core program is the actual program itself\n\n\nThen hooked on the onto the actual programs are the riders\n\n\nRiders are external features which are hooked onto the pro program\nyou see\n\n\nSo this is the one that parent-child option which is given free to\nyou\n\n\nYou can pass it to your first-born kid alright\n\n\nUh this is lifeline\n\n\nNow lifeline is medical rider\n\n\nNow uh if a person is infected with any of this disease a heart\nattack stroke invasive cancer invasive cancer means any cancer that is\ngrowing can be any part of the body kidney failure organ transplant multiple\nsclerosis viral hepatitis and heart disease requiring surgery\n\n\nThen the the money will be paid one of below\n\n\nThere's no restriction on how you use your money you see\n\n\nNow uh now so assuming that now let's say if you buy just hundred\ntwenty thousand uh your annual premium annual when I say annual I mean it's\npaid on a uh on an annual basis it's one five six three point nine\n\n\nBut you can also pay through a monthly giro\n\n\nMonthly giro means that the premium is deducted on a monthly basis\nfrom your bank account you see and that is only one three eight point zero\nnine which is not very much actually and that covers your hundred twenty\nthousand\n\n\nNow what does it cover\n\n\nYou're covered against any form of death whether by external\ndisease for hundred twenty thousand\n\n\nShould that occur we pay hundred and twenty thousand to you\n\n\nNow if you become disabled disabled can be due to many reasons uh\nit can be due to disease or injury or accident you know disease for example a\nheart attack stroke things like that uh you and you cannot do your current\noccupation which is that of a teacher lect uh researcher then we will pay the\nhundred and twenty thousand to you over five years\n\n\nSo you get twenty percent every year for five years\n\n\nIf you buy from any of our competitors they will pay you ten\npercent per year for ten years and you have to be totally disabled like a\nvegetable\n\n\nUh so now that is the disability part and if you should get any of\nthe diseases here we will pay you fifty thousand\n\n\nWe will pay fifty thousand one off\n\n\nHow what we what you do with the money is your wish\n\n\nThere's no restriction you see\n\n\nNow under this plan Mrs uh Lee you only pay for thirteen years\nafter that it is given free to you\n\n\nThe program becomes self-financing after thirteen years\n\n\nIn other words after thirteen years you don't have to pay for the\nprogram if you choose not to but the coverage still goes on you see\n\n\nNow uh assuming of course you want to give up the plan\n\n\nSo let's take it as one possible scenario at the age of sixty-five\n\n\nIf you choose to give up your program at at sixty-five I think\nthat's a good age because chances are the government may raise the retirement\nage to sixty-five you see\n\n\nSo if you give that up you get back sixty-one thousand and\nthirty-six dollars\n\n\nNow what you need to do is not to look at the absolute figure but\ntake the index ratio\n\n\nNow what do you mean by index ratio\n\n\nIs take the money that you'll get back divide by how much you have\nput in\n\n\nIn other words what you'll get back uh as a ratio of what you have\ninput into the program\n\n\nNow if you divide this by what you have put into the program is a\nreturn of three dollars that means for every dollar that you put in\neventually you're getting like three dollars here okay\n\n\nSo three dollars\n\n\nNow you must also note that you're only paying for thirteen years\nso take your current age plus thirteen that gives you forty-one\n\n\nSo that means from the age of forty-one you're not paying you're\nstill covered alright\n\n\nAnd at sixty-five when you give up you get back this\n\n\nSo in other words from forty-one to sixty-five you're enjoying free\ncoverage\n\n\nNow how much is that\n\n\nForty-five to sixty-five uh forty-one to sixty-five\n\n\nThat's about twenty-four years free coverage\n\n\nSo twenty-four times one six one three oh uh times one five six\nthree that's the annual premium that is your opportunity cost saving you see\n\n\nAnd uh if you were uh to get any disease listed here on diagnosis\nwe will pay you fifty thousand straightaway but if you don't get the disease\nbut just death or disability takes place we'll still pay this this amount\nhere\n\n\nSo in other words this doubles up as an insurance you see an\ninsurance which is paid to you one off on diagnosis of disease\n\n\nBut at the same time if you don't get a disease we will still pay\nyou on death or disability\n\n\nSo there are two concepts here\n\n\nOne is a saving concept which you will you will get when you\nterminate the plan if nothing has happened and the other concept is the\ncoverage concept which pays you on death or disability or on diagnosis of any\ndisease here\n\n\nI I'm going I hope it's clear clear to you\n\n\nNow this is only a summary of this uh because I realise that you\nmay not have much time\n\n\nSo usually when I'm dealing with professionals or business people\nuh I uh do uh summary for them you see\n\n\nNow you can see this is the premium column\n\n\nNow after thirteen years it's free\n\n\nIn other words you can see all zeros you're not paying\n\n\nNow cash value is your surrender value that means the money which\nis returned to you when you voluntarily terminate the plan okay\n\n\nSo this is the sixty-five mark here which I told you\n\n\nNow this is the policy here Mrs Mrs Lee policy here\n\n\nThis is your age summarised at five-year intervals\n\n\nSo you can see when you are sixty-five if you terminate you get\nback this\n\n\nIf you give up at seventy you get back this which is even more\n\n\nSo it acts also as an old age sav saving scheme for you but you\nmust note that after forty-one you are not paying\n\n\nNow this is the coverage on your life\n\n\nSo on death we pay this amount depending when the occurrence takes\nplace\n\n\nNow uh I mean of course nobody likes to talk about such things but\nwe have to explain to you\n\n\nSo if the occurrence takes place on the tenth year then this amount\nis paid to you\n\n\nBut on disability we pay this amount over five years which I\nexplain to you just now\n\n\nOn death whole amount is paid On disability over five years but on\ndiagnosis of the disease is here fifty thousand is paid as an advance one off\nalright\n\n\nNow this is one side of the story that means after fourteen years\nyou're not paying\n\n\nNow the other now this a medical part which is included here now\nthe other side of the story is that after fourteen years you may be doing\nvery well in your career whether here or somewhere else and you may choose to\nkeep on paying so we give you two alternatives\n\n\nAfter thirteen fourteen years you can go for free or you can keep\non paying if you want to\n\n\nNow if you keep on paying you must note the premium remains the\nsame\n\n\nThere's no change uh but it is fully paid up at sixty-five\n\n\nNow look at the annual premium column\n\n\nThis is a running total uh accumulative total of all the premiums\nyou have paid\n\n\nNow look at sixty-five and seventy\n\n\nCan you see the figures are the same\n\n\nThere's no change\n\n\nIt means that it is fully paid up at sixty-five\n\n\nSo af after sixty-five even if you want to pay also we don't want\nto accept the money\n\n\nBut if you're still covered you know\n\n\nNow so uh now this is your surrender value uh Mrs Lee you can see\nwhen you give up at sixty-five you get hundred forty thousand as compared to\njust now uh sixty-five you get sixty-one thousand you get hundred forty so it\nis more than double\n\n\nNow of course if you keep on paying your interest grows faster\n\n\nThere's no doubt about that\n\n\nSo when you stop paying there's a slowdown of your growth rate of\nyour bonuses and your interest\n\n\nSo you can see that at sixty-five when you terminate you get this\n\n\nNow if you terminate at seventy you get hundred and eighty-six\nthousand\n\n\nNow if you terminate at eighty it will be even more\n\n\nNow this plan you stop paying at sixty-five\n\n\nIt's fully paid up you see why but the coverage will go until\nninety nine years of age until such time as you don't want the plan and you\nterminate it\n\n\nThen we'll pay you the cash surrender value\n\n\nSo under this plan or under most insurance plans there are two\nconcepts\n\n\nOne is the cash surrender value that is a savings element and the\nother one is the coverage\n\n\nThere's always these two concepts you see\n\n\nNow this is the death benefit uh so on the event of death we pay\nthis amount \n\n\nHow much You check off against the year here alright Now this is\na policy year we run it from one to twenty This is a summary of your age at\nfive-year intervals right Now it will go on until nineteen ninety but I stop\nat seventy because there's no place for the computer printout So this is what\nwe pay on death ah in the event of diagnosis of disease fifty thousand is\npaid one off and uh on disability we pay over five years the full amount you\nsee Now this is the medical part which is included there already Now this is\nthe interesting part nuh the parent-child option which I was explaining to\nyou I I do not know whether you're planning to start a family soon if I'm not\nright right Uh let's say you you have a kid now I I just run a hypothetical\nexample alright Let's say you have a kid now uh uh a son you just born of\ncourse uh it doesn't mean that you must have a son now you can have a son two\nyears from now you see and then you can register him under this rider which\nis given free to you if you buy the plan So when your son is eighty one if\nyou transfer the plan to your son we will give you back twenty-six thousand\nalright Your son's coverage will start at hundred and twenty thousand but he\nis only paying this premium rate per month per year sorry per year Now this\nyou can see is an extremely cheaf cheap rate of seven hundred and four\ndollars per year and that is twenty-one years from now Assuming\nhypothetically that you have a new-born son now but if you have a son two\nyears from now the rate is even cheaper you see because your son is not born\nyet So the rate is seven o four per year alright and uh this money is given\nback to you This is his insurance this is his premium Now we can extrapolate\nuh into the into the future So let's say you have passed to your son at\ntwenty-one when your son is sixty years of age uh if you terminate the plan\nyou will get back he will get back two hundred eighty-five thousand and this\ncoverage will be this amount here This is his coverage when he's sixty years\nof age We are now projecting into the future but all the time he's only\npaying this premium which is that of a small baby just born you see If I can\njust show you by a straight line graph uh you see let's call let's look at\nthis This is premium rate and this is uh age huh So uh are you familiar with\nstatistics Uh now as you get older and older Mrs Lee your premium rate will\nincrease but once you have bought the plan the rate is fixed you see So it\ndepends where you come on board you see alright Now the older you are of\ncourse the more expensive it is because we are more susceptible to diseases\nSo assuming now your son when he's twenty-one you pass him the plan by right\nhe should be paying this premium rate here alright of a twenty-one year old\nbut actually what he's paying is this premium rate here of a newborn infant\nbackdated to the year he was born you see that that is the whole concept you\nsee but even if he your son is born healthy uh or your daughter is born\nhealthy there is no guarantee that they will remain healthy until twenty-one\nyou see So even along the way if they develop a medical problem at twenty-one\nthey are guaranteed of this uh of this plan you you know what I'm trying to\nsay Now basically this is the the plan that we have been selling quite a lot\nof it around here to to the to uh I've some of it in the law faculty you see\nUh this is the summary alright this is a summary whereby you stop paying\nafter fourteen years This one you have the option of paying till sixty-five\nyou know after fourteen years you need not stop you can keep on paying till\nsixty-five then you follow this scenario here Then this is your covering\nletter and this is a brochure which explains a bit of what I have just told\nyou the parent's option alright where you can pass it to your kid and uh I've\nalso enclosed one plan for your husband in case he may be interested to have\na talk", "subdomain":

some coverage\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nRight uhm and I have been approached several time by different\npeople about uh\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nThe fact that the coverage is not sufficient you see\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nUh and and things like that\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd I've also seen the several uh uh advertisement on the\npapers\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nplus also mails lah\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nthat talk about uh that focuses on uhm low premium but uh\nhaving uh\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> is it\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nUh so I'm a bit curious as to uh what what does this offer\nversus the normal type of uh insurance coverage you see\n\n\nUhm seems like to me that uh this type uh gives protection\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nUh but uh it's not something that's for saving versus the life\ntype that is both uh\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nCoverage protecting protection and also saving lah\n\n<$B> \n\nYep\n\n<$A> \n\nThat that seems to be the difference to me\n\n<$B> \n\nSo that's the main diff but\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nCan I find out what you've got now\n\n<$A> \n\nUh okay I've got uh I've got uh I think I've I've got two GEs\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nwhich which covers uh I think it's about two hundred plus K or\nthereabout\n\n<$B> \n\nAre they all totally savings or <unclear> word </unclear>\nsaving\n\n<$A> \n\nOne is endowment and the other one is life\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> All hundred percent\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat is hundred percent\n\n<$B> \n\nThat means there is no uhm no protection only

just increase\nthe cover without increasing the savings\n\n<$A> \n\nYa ya\n\n<$B> \n\nHuh\n\n<$A> \n\nThey are riders yes\n\n<$B> \n\nThey they they're sort of uh composite lah\n\n<$A> \n\nBut they're I don't have uh rider alone type if if you if you\nsee what I'm talking about\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm how old are they\n\n<$A> \n\nJust about maybe about two years I think\n\n<$B> \n\nYou mean you took them together one after the other\n\n<$A> \n\nThey uh sort of almost lah\n\n<$B> \n\nTwo years old lah\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay so that's an endowment\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat is the typical uh range of coverage normally for most\nmost most people\n\n<$B> \n\nIt actually ties in to how much you want to put aside\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nHow much you want to cater if you go off suddenly\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nuhm what are your outstanding\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nyou know uhm that you'll things that you have to provide for\n\n<$A> \n\nso <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nYa I mean you one-room flat kind of dweller\n\n\nIt's more than sufficient income\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nIf you have you know great visions for your sons and <unclear>\nword </unclear> them for

like\n\n<$A> \n\nI think there was the latest one I receive is uh CIGNA\n\n<$B> \n\nAh CIGNA ya\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nCredit card one\n\n<$A> \n\nYa so that one is actually I think it's like uh you you every\nmonth you pay about twenty thirty dollars or something like that and the\ncover for fifty K or hundred K\n\n\nUhm they've I think sometime ago there was one that talk about uh\nthat that came from uh uhm the one that's associated with NTUC I think uh\n\n<$B> \n\nINCOME\n\n<$A> \n\nit it's not INCOME but there there there's another one that\n\n<$B> \n\nThere is another one\n\n<$A> \n\nuhm can't remember the name\n\n<$B> \n\nICS\n\n<$A> \n\nHuh\n\n<$B> \n\nICS\n\n<$A> \n\nYa ya ya I think it's ICS uh\n\n\nThat that was on the papers\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nBut several of these uh credit card ones also uh provide uh\nthis type of uh uh protection only type of uh coverage\n\n<$B> \n\nFrom the protection only insurance you want know about it or\nare you in the position to say Yes I think I need more insurance but I want\nto get maximum protection for minimum amount only\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat's your state of mind right now\n\n<$A> \n\nUh I'm just trying to explore uh what are the various\nofferings uh in terms of protection only\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nand and then maybe make an assessment whether I can afford or\nI can't afford\n\n<$B> \n\nAh okay let me just run through quickly\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm they come in many names lah okay\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nBasically there're of a temporary nature\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nHave you got time\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no no I've I've enough time\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm okay and that's twenty minutes <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nSo you get of a temporary\n\n<$A> \n\nThe tension is released after that huh\n\n<$B> \n\nYa can disclose more confidential information\n\n\nOkay it's of a temporary nature uhm\n\n\nThe ones which the credit cards normally offer are yearly\nrenewable\n\n<$A> \n\nOh okay what does that mean\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's goes year by year uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nand it's subject to the company renewing it\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nIt it it possibly uhm normally the structure would be the\npremium will be stepped\n\n\nThat means\n\n<$A> \n\nIs it\n\n<$B> \n\nwith\n\n<$A> \n\nI thought from the\n\n<$B> \n\nFrom this age group to this age group is this price\n\n<$A> \n\nOh okay\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n\nUhm and I think over and above sixty or sixty five\n\n\nThey don't want to insure you any more\n\n<$A> \n\nOh okay\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay uhm and sometimes they've already <unclear> word\n</unclear> in this they might do an average\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nBut it it's it's generally either one or the other lah\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n\nUhm it's the main difference is whether you want to ensure that it\ndoes its job or not\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nor do you want to only insure for x number of years and are\nhappy that it runs out\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nRight\n\n<$B> \n\nThat that as far as I'm concerned my my responsibility to my\nfamily is only until I'm fifty by after which anything happens to me you guys\nare on your own something like that\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nIt it's it's how you look at it\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nIf you're looking at cash at or or okay providing cash and\nthere there's an end-point of time then you would rule this out because you\ndon't have any temporary type insurances which last your whole life long\n\n\nIt will definitely expire\n\n<$A> \n\nThis this one uh\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm ya\n\n\nTheir low premium <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nAnyway it doesn't it doesn't give you cash right\n\n<$B> \n\nIt doesn't\n\n\nThere's no savings\n\n<$A> \n\nUh ya ya it's just protection\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's it's money gone once you pay up\n\n<$B> \n\nYa it's it's like a car insurance <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nRight right\n\n<$B> \n\nno accident okay\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n\nUhm I think sometimes they calculate with an accident insurance\nand they bundle it all together uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat do you mean by that\n\n\nAccident accident\n\n<$B> \n\nAre you familiar with personal accident insurances\n\n<$A> \n\nUh no no\n\n<$B> \n\nUh it pays if you have an accident and you you don't survive\nyou get disabled\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nLoose limbs fingers <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nOh oh okay okay\n\n<$B> \n\nthat kind of thing\n\n<$A> \n\nYa ya ya\n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nI think that's provided by CIA\n\n<$B> \n\nCIGNA Ya\n\n<$A> \n\nCIA CIGNA ya\n\n<$B> \n\nUh it it normally they they do it hand in hand uh\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThey package it such that it looks very cheap because uhm\nstatistically death and disability by accidents is actually very small uhm\npercentage small risks as compared to all disabilities and all death cau\ncauses of death disabilities\n\n\nSo these premiums are very low\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nand they couple it with one that's only for limited period\n\n\nThey can bring down the premiums lah\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n\nUhm what else do you need to know\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThe let me try and recall okay\n\n\nThere's this other type which what is it uh\n\n\nHave have you heard this critical illness\n\n<$A> \n\nOh ya the <unclear> word </unclear> eleven\n\n<$B> \n\ninsurance ya ya\n\n<$A> \n\nsomething like that ya\n\n<$B> \n\nThat one is also comes under this type of category\n\n<$A> \n\nOh okay okay\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I think uh CIGNA that did mention that also <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nCannot recall CIGNA <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nWell I would classify it under critical illness type\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm they pay on diagnosis\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nRight\n\n\nUhm it's sort of an enhanced uhm insurance over and above\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nJust the purely temporary type\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nor the purely accident type\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm of course because it's an enhanced variety it costs you\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay risks are higher because you don't have to die okay you\njust need to suffer one of the following\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's what it is\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n\nUh what else do they have\n\n\nI think that's basically it lah\n\n\nIt's it's only in the packaging\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm I don't know whether\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nhow you you are the how the cheapest in the market go for it\ntype or what\n\n<$A> \n\nUh\n\n<$B> \n\nRough overview lah\n\n\nThat's all I can think of right now\n\n<$A> \n\nYa ya okay\n\n\nUhm for this how difficult is it to claim\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm not difficult lah\n\n<$A> \n\nNot difficult because I understand there were some there\nthere're some medical terminology involved\n\n\nIt doesn't mean that you have a pain in the heart then you know\nthat's it uh\n\n<$B> \n\nI've spoken to our doctors\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nnormal doctors lah which are on our med panel\n\n<$A> \n\nUh\n\n<$B> \n\nThey think it's a fair definition\n\n<$A> \n\nIs that right\n\n<$B> \n\nUh they think it it's actually good that these things are\nspelt out quite clearly\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nWell as long as the doctor says you've got a heart attack\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nwe should pay up\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nI mean you can't claim based on certain symptoms that I have\na heart attack\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nwhen ECGY and everything Ys you don't\n\n<$A> \n\nOf course\n\n<$B> \n\nthat's just <unclear> word </unclear> so\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm these tend to be more popular nowadays lah\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nbeing a more affluent society\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nso we've more affluent diseases\n\n<$A> \n\nYa that's true\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm the criteria for underwriting would basically be your\nhealth and your parents' health\n\n<$A> \n\nOh parents' health\n\n\nOh okay\n\n<$B> \n\nIn case of hereditary diseases\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nlike diabetes kidney you know which that kind of thing\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nKidney failure can can be a cause\n\n<$A> \n\nRight right right\n\n<$B> \n\nSo if if your folks or if your parents are not alive and they\nsuf they died of cancer and all\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nit might be a minus lah\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nfrom the underwriting point\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay So the advantage of this is that it gives you protection\nuhm however <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's on a temporary nature lah\n\n\nThe the one thing the advantage is actually the cost lah\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat normally what we do when we propose is we normally\npackage it with a savings type policy\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nbecause if if you look at it over the long period of cover\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nuhm it's basically an expense\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm ya for this and it's sometimes they specially uhm work it\ninto the policy that it increases\n\n<$A> \n\nUh huh\n\n<$B> \n\nten percent a year\n\n\nSome personalised <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nThe premium or protection\n\n<$B> \n\nYa protection\n\n<$A> \n\nOh okay\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm but most of them don't\n\n<$A> \n\nUh huh\n\n<$B> \n\nUh so you would you're actually paying and paying and paying\nlah\n\n<$A> \n\nIs that right\n\n<$B> \n\nas opposed to a savings policy where effectively your savings\nand you're offsetting the premiums through the years\n\n<$A> \n\nOh uh huh\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause if if you if you have a savings value you've got\npremium outlay\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nand as it as the savings increases and your premiums remain\nin constant\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nyou are actually offsetting the premium\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nJust like an account that you're depositing all the time and\nnot withdrawing\n\n<$A> \n\nI I don't understand that part\n\n\nWhat what do you how do you offset this thing again\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay there's a portion in your present insurances which\nprovides for savings right\n\n<$A> \n\nRight\n\n<$B> \n\nand you could put in your premiums as if they're deposits uhm\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nUhm I'm sure your agent would've explained to you that it probably\nstarts from the third year onwards right\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm Oh okay\n\n<$B> \n\nSo so if if let's say you deposit say two thousand dollars\nokay and year one year two year three \n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nyou've hit six thousand dollars\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nand year three begins your savings value according to your\nabout three thousand dollars\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nso if you net it\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nyou're hardly would have actually been three thousand\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nso over the three years it would actually cost you\n\n<$A> \n\nOh oh okay\n\n<$B> \n\nout of pocket one thousand a year\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSo as as you go down through the years\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nthere'll be a break-even point sometime like eleven years\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay ya okay\n\n<$B> \n\nwhere effectively you've only lost interest\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nand through the years there'll be a net return So in that\nsense\n\n<$A> \n\nOh oh okay\n\n<$B> \n\nthere's no loss\n\n<$A> \n\nI see I see okay\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nso all the interest lah\n\n<$B> \n\nYa but there's I think there's a offsetting along the way\nFinally catch up\n\n<$A> \n\nIs that right\n\n<$B> \n\nThere is a small cost involved in insurance\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nthe you pay significantly more premiums as compared to a\ntemporary insurance the term insurance\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUh but a lot of it is already <unclear> word </unclear> in\nthe savings element\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nYou see uhm it it it cost maybe say fifty dollars or thirty\ndollars for a term It might cost you a hundred and fifty dollars for the same\namount of insurance\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nso that the insurance part is actually thirty dollars\n\n<$A> \n\nRight\n\n<$B> \n\nBut hundred and twenty would actually go into savings lah\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> Uh huh\n\n<$B> \n\nif you look at it from that point of view\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm okay\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay That's what I meant lah\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm",

what you have here is this the user\n\n\nNow there are two ways the user could communicate with the main\ncomputer\n\n\nIt's either by Uachat <unclear> word </unclear> or through the PSTN\n\n\nThat's the Public Service Telephone Network\n\n\nNow if by any chance the reception is not good okay the machine\nwill automatically tape <unclear> word </unclear> into the PSTN which means\nthat you'll be

node\n\n<$A> \n\nYes it is\n\n\nYa it is accessible\n\n\nI mean the information is uh say unless you you want to get into\naccess through close <unclear> word </unclear> user group then you pay a\nsmall\n\n<$C> \n\nYa Access to what\n\n<$A> \n\nLowest user group\n\n\nNow close user group uh uh services a provider <unclear> word\n</unclear> to a very specific model\n\n<$C> \n\nUh huh\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> Those user group uh for a minimum\nsum maybe some services service providers require maybe twenty five dollars\nfor a month\n\n\nThen you will subscribe now you know that

<unclear> word </unclear> information information that is\ngrowing Right now a hundred thousand pages ten thousand customers eighty\nthree service providers and then this is only the tip of the iceberg that's\ngoing We are at the forefront of information okay So the Education Education\nWe have what we call for primary school students a very comprehensive\nsupplementary program that uh

{"text": "<$A> \n\nOkay this this one is the living assurance policy and uhm\nwhat I will advice is that you top up thirty-five to uh fifty thousand\n\n\nAlright the first column show you the total premium you pay over the year\n\n\nUh second column is the cash value alright\n\n\nCash value means that anytime you want to terminate your policy you can take \nback the cash\n\n<$B> \n\nMoney you can get back\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nYou terminate the policy\n\n<$A> \n\nYa if you terminate the policy this is the amount of money you can get back \nalright\n\n\nUh death benefit of course uhm it means the twenty-six illnesses uh it's \ncovering as well as in time of death or total and permanent disability\n\n\nThen you are quite clear about the type of policy we're having right\n\n<$B> \n\nPaid up I forget\n\n\nPaid up is the one uh okay let's say say for example number ten year\n\n\nOkay I I stop payment or the premium and this and I let the policy\ngoes on so this is the uh uh coverage isn't it\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay paid up means that okay at any time uh any one year if you want\nto stop paying alright if you get that in cash it's going to be\nvery much less than what you're going to get alright\n\n\nSo if you opt for pay up means that you know\n\n<$B> \n\nThe policy will still run lah\n\n<$A> \n\nIt will still down anytime down the years let's say ten years later\n\n\nIf you opt for a pay up at tenth time even is uh twenty years down\nthe road it will still pay you that particular value\n\n\nYa for example if let's say at the tenth year you opt for pay up\nwhich is eleven thousand so another ten years down the road okay\nyou will only they will only eleven thousand if something happen to you\n\n<$B> \n\nIf something happen\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I mean of course here it means uhm it means in terms of the twenty-six \nsicknesses or in time or death and total and disability\n\n<$B> \n\nFour O six\n\n\nSuch a small policy\n\n<$A> \n\nThat's because uhm uhm uh top it up for your last twenty-five thousand\n\n<$B> \n\nI didn't know that last time I bought so such a small policy\n\n<$A> \n\nOh yes I am trying to ask you to buy a bigger policy you say no no no\n\n<$B> \n\nSuch a small policy fifteen thousand\n\n<$A> \n\nSo should I keep increase to what fifty thousand\n\n\nFifty thousand are you sure\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I don't want to\n\n\nI I don't want to spend so much money\n\n<$A> \n\nAlright normally for uhm for any insurance policy what\nyou should consider is that uhm you can either pay uh\nabout fifteen per cent of your annual salary alright\n\n\nThe total premium should be about fifteen per cent of your annual salary\n\n<$B> \n\nThat is a lot isn't it\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAlamak fifteen is a lot of money\n\n<$A> \n\nWell it's uh money from the left hand pocket to the right hand pocket\n\n\nYou still get back every cent eventually\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's a lot of money\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd I say you you still get back every cent eventually alright\n\n\nSo as I said it's either fifteen per cent of your annual salary or\nuhm it's uh six times your annual salary the total amount you should return\n\n<$B> \n\nSix times\n\n<$A> \n\nSix to seven times your annual salary depending on the age\n\n<$B> \n\nSix times\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's also a lot\n\n<$A> \n\nThen you are under insured\n\n<$B> \n\nI have how much\n\n\nLet's see how much\n\n\nI have maybe perhaps talking about six times\nI have maybe only uh how much am I insured\n\n<$A> \n\nHow much are you insured\n\n<$B> \n\nLess than two hundred thousand\n\n<$A> \n\nNo uh no\n\n\nOkay when I talk about six seven time your annual salary\nalright it also cover your term policy alright\n\n\nIt will cover uhm the amount which your company is buying for you\n\n\nIt doesn't means that everything is out of your pocket okay and\nuh normally as a person grow older the amount uhm insured over\nthe annual salary can be less\n\n\nFor example if you are in your forties then the amount which\ncan be five times your annual salary\n\n\nBecause by then your income would have increased so it cannot\nbe six seven times in at that\n\n<$B> \n\nFifteen thousand for four hundred dollars\n\n<$A> \n\nThis is very little right\n\n<$B> \n\nYa expensive\n\n<$A> \n\nNo it's not\n\n<$B> \n\nKim Wan one how much uh I forgot four hundred plus also\n\n<$A> \n\nYa but Kim Wan age is uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThat one is without loading\n\n<$A> \n\nUh that is without loading but of course I'm giving her\nthe standard right but actually when it comes back to us I think probably\n\n<$B> \n\nDoes she need to go through another policy uh uh uh medical check up\n\n<$A> \n\nI doubt so because it's only in the matter of one year\n\n<$B> \n\nSo not necessary ya\n\n<$A> \n\nBut as I say I can't say anything in this present moment\n\n\nIf the underwriter need her to go for a medical check check-up\nshe has to also alright\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy underwriter so cautious\n\n<$A> \n\nWell uhm the risk is there you see and uh that type of\nmedication which she is taking is still basically the\nsame so I'm not very sure whether they still need\nuhm to uh for her to go for another check-up\n\n<$B> \n\nYour this uh so-called concession what or offer period\nor concession rate until end of this year\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's just no it's up to thirtieth of November but of course\nuh don't wait until the last minute because uh it may be\nsome complication who knows\n\n<$B> \n\nYou think something like Telecoms rush\n\n<$A> \n\nYa ya ya you'd be surprised you know\n\n<$B> \n\nNo lah what Telecoms rush\n\n\nYou won't have another Telecoms rush\n\n<$A> \n\nNo what I mean of course not\n\n\nBut what I'm trying to say is that okay give us two weeks\nyou know because maybe you need a medical check-up you know\n\n<$B> \n\nI need a medical check-up\n\n<$A> \n\nDon't be too sure don't be too sure\n\n<$B> \n\nI am very sure I am very sure\n\n\nActually not bad uh medical check-up free medical check-up\n\n\nI want to go for medical check-up\n\n\nI talked about it for years no action\n\n<$A> \n\nSo you want a free medical check-up\n\n<$B> \n\nFree right\n\n<$A> \n\nYa but\n\n<$B> \n\nCan refer one right\n\n<$A> \n\nBut they only charge you on your blood sorry on your\nblood and urine that's right\n\n<$B> \n\nNot I went for blood test cholesterol\n\n\nDon't know what it's because of the you know the I want\nto go on the acu test the acu test so you need a blood test\n\n<$A> \n\nSo coming back to this policy maybe I should refresh your memory later\n\n\nAlright uh for example let's look at uhm fifty-five if\nyou decide to stop paying and if something happen uh ten\nyears down the road okay they're still be paying you the new uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAye how come\n\n<$A> \n\nBenefit minus the ten years without uh minus the ten years premium\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's it's different from paying up uh\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's different ya\n\n<$B> \n\nThat must be after paying back\n\n<$A> \n\nNormally people will opt for it only after a few years because\nit make no sense you see\n\n\nFor example if if if you pay for about fifteen years or so this\npolicy can actually run until you're in eighties and I think\nit's worth while considering because you are only covered medically until\n\n<$B> \n\nFifty-five until sixty\n\n<$A> \n\nFifty-five or sixty after that you're not cover uhm by any medical insurance\n\n<$B> \n\nThis one is sixty uh\n\n<$A> \n\nNo those who are\n\n<$B> \n\nSixty-five\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no no\n\n\nI show the figure fifty-five sixty sixty-five because this\nis the time when people stop paying you see because when you\nretire as long as this policy you don't terminate it will continue you know\n\n<$B> \n\nSo\n\n<$A> \n\nup to your eighties even in your nineties\n\n<$B> \n\nBut you it only covers up to sixty-five what or something\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no no no\n\n<$B> \n\nFifty-five something like that isn't it\n\n<$A> \n\nYou're wrong\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nNo you're wrong\n\n<$B> \n\nNo no no\n\n\nI thought the policy was was was uh\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay this policy technically alright\n\n<$B> \n\nTechnically\n\n<$A> \n\nAlright will be you have to pay up to eight well you have to pay up to \neighty-seven years\n\n\nAlright that means if you continue paying when the person is eighty-eight \nalright that's when the policy become free\n\n\nBut normally people won't pay for such a long period so normally\npeople pay for fifteen years or they pay until they are fifty-five\nsixty or sixty-five then you stop paying alright\n\n\nAnd the policy will be able to run on so let's say if you stop paying at \nfifty-five or sixty right if something happen to you at seventy years\nold they will still pay you\n\n\nSo it is actually uhm quite sometimes It's after uh\n\n<$B> \n\nAll along I thought this policy were only cover up to what sixty-five\nyears old or fifty-five years old or something like that\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no\n\n<$B> \n\nIt used to be like that isn't it\n\n<$A> \n\nIt was never use to be like that\n\n\nI think you got it wrong right from the start\n\n<$B> \n\nNo I thought so\n\n<$A> \n\nNo\n\n<$B> \n\nI remember it it was\n\n<$A> \n\nNo as I was explaining for example okay uhm if you stop paying at fifty-five \nokay the coverage is forty-three right\n\n\nNow at sixty-five if something happen to you okay they will pay you\nsixty-nine minus the ten year premium plus interest\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nSo isn't that very attractive\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat so attracting\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat what do you mean by not so attractive because you already stop paying \nthey're giving you the new coverage minus the ten year premium plus uh\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's attractive if it's free\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd if it's attractive is free nothing is for free\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm nothing is for free\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nTo break-even so it takes so long to break-even fifteen years\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm break-even is about uh fourteen fifteen years\n\n<$B> \n\nTakes so long\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm whether it's long or short it's relative\n\n<$B> \n\nActually I can go and buy a what and tick\n\n\nOr this one cannot be as a rider right you told me before I bought\n\n<$A> \n\nIt can be as a rider but a rider will stop at sixty in that sense\nyou are right\n\n\nYou buy a rider you will stop covering you at sixty and for a\nrider there is no bonus included alright that means if something\nhappens to you\n\n\nLet's say if you buy a thirty thousand rider attach to a policy\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's cheaper right\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's much cheaper but if let's say nothing happen you won't get\na single cent and if something happen you'll only get\n\n<$B> \n\nBut the main policy the main policy uh it's income generally\n\n<$A> \n\nYa the basic policy there is bonus so as you see the figure\nactually increase\n\n\nFor example you look at the cash value uh on return here is a\nvery small amount but as you go along you know the amount increase\n\n<$B> \n\nIs it cheaper if I go in that way I I do it that way\n\n\nThat I buy another like some other policy then I take this as a rider\n\n\nIs it more more\n\n<$A> \n\nI think it's not advisable\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause this policy\n\n<$B> \n\nHow come I don't have a convertible rider\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause you never buy a rider\n\n<$B> \n\nBut does that really matter\n\n\nYou see it's still at the same rate whether I I get the rider or not\n\n<$A> \n\nYa but presumably let's say if you are medically unfit right now\nif you have a rider then the company have not right to reject you\n\n\nYou get what I'm trying to say\n\n<$B> \n\nAh ha\n\n<$A> \n\nAlright so the other about this policy is that now if you take it\nas a rider now this policy or rather the rider will stop paying\nwhen you are sixty\n\n\nAnd the two particular disease which you have Alzheimer and\nParkinson and that basically attack a person in their old age\n\n\nAnd a lot of this problem actually you know uh appears when\nthe person is old and it doesn't make sense you know that\nyou buy this policy to protect you right now but when it come\nto your old age there's nothing to protect you", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "7c10e966-6532-401b-8d3b-4378c4f887bc", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.609319+00:00"}

currently one boy\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm one boy ah\n\n\nUh your wife is working\n\n<$B> \n\nYes she is\n\n<$A> \n\nOh as what\n\n<$B> \n\nAs a secretary\n\n<$A> \n\nAs a secretary\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nOh what about yourself\n\n\nWhat do you do\n\n<$B> \n\nI am a software engineer\n\n<$A> \n\nSoftware engineer\n\n\nWow that is engineering isn't it\n\n\nI T\n\n\nYou must be busy with the Y2 bug and the ever changing I T\ntechnology these days\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah got to catch up with them \n\n<$A> \n\nShare with me your knowledge of insurance Raymond\n\n\nWhat do you know\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uh\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd what you may not know or understand\n\n\nWhat do you have at the moment too\n\n<$B> \n\nAt the moment I have a small N T U C Income policy uhm uh but\nI don't really know much about insurance\n\n\nUh because that time I got it uh just because the N T U C Income\nagent came down to our uh army camp\n\n<$A> \n\nOh I see\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nYou may be wondering why I ask you so many questions\n\n\nThe reason is to know what actually you want and what actually you\nneed\n\n\nOh yes just to confirm what you have shared\n\n\nYou are 27 years old right\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nYou are married and you have a six month old baby boy\n\n\nYou have an insurance programme when you were 18 years old from N T\nU C when you were in the army\n\n\nAnd a small protection of fifteen thousand dollars whole life plan\n\n<$B> \n\nyes yes\n\n<$A> \n\nSo what made you to consider to have more insurances now\n\n<$B> \n\nWell uhm ah basically I am earning much more now and uh\nbesides I see a lot of people around me suffering from critical illnesses\nthat really cost a bomb to the family\n\n\nAnd uh in the end it will leave the family in the lurch when they\ndie\n\n\nSo uhm at this moment I wish to save more as well as to provide\nmore protection for my family sake\n\n<$A> \n\nOk so you feel that you are older now earning a higher income\nyou and you have a family now and also you wish to have the savings as well\nas protection for your family right\n\n<$B> \n\nYah\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay now besides that what other things do you have in mind\n\n\nYou must have beard from other companies or from your friends the\ncompany's products\n\n<$B> \n\nNo ah not much so far\n\n\nAs a matter of fact I didn't bother about it initially\n\n\nSo I don't really have a grasp of what insurance can offer me\n\n<$A> \n\nOh I see\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nNow in this case since you shared with me that you do not really\nhave a grasp of what's available or for the matter what kind of insurance\nthere are I will start with you some basic understanding of insurance\n\n\nInsurance is basically savings put in a certain institution called\ninsurance company that will give you a higher amount of money back when the\npolicy matures or where the company will take uh undertake for you certain\nresponsibilities when you die permanently and totally disabled or when you\nare diagnosed of a certain critical illness\n\n\nThere are basically 3 kinds of insurannce namely\n\n\n1 Term plan\n\n\n2 Endowment and\n\n\n3 Whole life plans\n\n\nTerm plans generally gives you a high coverage for death or\npermanent disability with no returns that is there will not be any money in\nreturn if nothing happens to you\n\n\nIt's like renting a flat where you don't own it\n\n\nOnce you leave yu have to return it to the owner\n\n\nEndowment plans gives you a certain amount of money at a certain\nperiod say after 20 years\n\n\nYou will need to put aside a generally higher premium for this plan\n\n\nIt also covers you for only death and permanent disability only\n\n\nYou can add riders like hospitalisation benefits or critical\nillnesses coverage etc to this basic plan\n\n\nWhole life is somewhat different\n\n\nIt covers you for life at a much lower premium due to death\npermanent disability as well as upon diagnosis of critical illness\n\n\nOkay am I going too fast for you Raymond\n\n<$B> \n\nAh no so far so good\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n\nGood\n\n\nI'm glad that you understand so far\n\n\nAnd ah just to reinstate\n\n\nI understand that you wish to protect yourself against illnesses\ndeath and to do a little savings for your old age as well as for your little\nprince's education\n\n\nRight may I ask what is your budget for yourself and for your son\n\n<$B> \n\nAh well\n\n\nI think for myself it will be around the range of\n\n$250 and ah my uh\n\n\nI mean\n\n<$A> \n\nFor your son\n\n<$B> \n\nFor myself 250 and for my son probably a hundred\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n\nNow uhm as a professional in this field I always feel it is\nimportant to look into the welfare for our family those who are still around\nwhen we are gone\n\n\nI am happy to know Raymond that you thought likewise\n\n\nLet me print this out for you\n\n\nOkay I'm proposing to you this plan that pays you a hundred\nthousand if premature death were to occur to you right now or when you are\nunfortunate to be diagnosed of any of the 30 illnesses\n\n\nIn this case you will also receive a paid lump sum of 20 per cent\nto the sum assured on the first year and subsequently the remaining 80 per\ncent on the second year when you are totally and permanently disabled\n\n\nAfter that you will be paid a yearly amount of fifty thousand till\nyou are age 65\n\n\nWow does this sounds good\n\n\nThe beauty of this plan is that you need to only pay for 20 years\nafter which the plan will automatically grow on its own earning bonuses as it\ngoes along\n\n\nMoreover with these two plans with this plan your two kids\nincluding your future child will be given free critical illnesses coverage of\nten thousand each if they are diagnosed of the illnesses\n\n\nThey must be between the age of thirty days old to eighteen years\nold\n\n\nAin't that good\n\n\nWhat do you think of this plan\n\n<$B> \n\nIt seems so interesting ah I mean what John Hancock can offer\n\n\nYou mean that any of my child is diagnosed for any of the 30\nillnesses I'm able to claim ten thousand from John Hancock\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nSo what happen to my policy then\n\n<$A> \n\nYour policy still carries on till you either cancel it or\ntill there is a claim made\n\n<$B> \n\nSo you mean I can like take out some money after 20 years\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah you can you can cash it out but I have a better idea\n\n\nYou don't cash it out but instead you take a loan carry on with\nthe Giro deduction and you are still under cover by John Hancock\n\n\nYou need not pay back till you have the money\n\n\nIf anything does happen to you or you wish to surrender it later\nthe amount at that point of time would always be higher than what you\nborrowed\n\n\nThere are lots of ideas that I can share with you that can benefit\nyou and your family while you save with John Hancock\n\n<$B> \n\nThat sure is interesting\n\n\nAnd what about my son's plan then\n\n<$A> \n\nNow uhm he'll be going to the army when he's 20 about 18\nyears old and he'll be in the university when he's 21 years old so it's about\n20 years from now\n\n\nNow I've worked out this plan whereby you can take out a sum about\nforty thousand\n\n\nWhen he's 21 years old and moreover for this kind of plan\nchildren's plan if anything does happen to you or your wife be it in terms of\ndeath permanent disability or diagnosis of illnesses the premium will be\ntotally waived meaning you don't have to pay anymore\n\n\nJohn Hancock will take the responsibility of paying the premium\n\n\nYou just pay for the time to come\n\n\nWhen he's 21 years old and you can take out the money\n\n<$B> \n\nOh there is something now whereby even if my wife is\ndiagnosed of illness or what you call death of disability I don't need to pay\nanymore\n\n<$A> \n\nOh yah yah\n\n<$B> \n\nSo uhm in fact what you share with me so far I think\n\n\n\n\n\nUhm well basically will meet my needs and my family\n\n\nWell ah looks like John Hancock do provide some good products\n\n\nI think ah I like to sign up ah for such a plan\n\n\n\n\n<$A> \n\nWell I'm glad that uhm you wish to do that but just to\nreinstate do you understand so far what I've shared what I shown to you and\nillustrated to you\n\n<$B> \n\nWell ah so far uhm yes\n\n<$A> \n\nOk Raymond so can I have your IC so that we can start the\nprocess of filling in the forms and uhm make the payment too\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm Okay no problem here is my IC\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm all right thank you\n\n\nWell Raymond I'm very happy for you\n\n\nDo you know that you've actually put your family first by getting\nthese plans\n\n\nJust to recap what you've signed up\n\n\nYou've got for yourself a plan that protects you a minimum of a\nhundred thousand if you faced premature death or upon diagnosis of any of the\n30 critical illnesses and if you are totally and permanently disabled to\nreceive 20 per cent of the sum assured that is twenty thousand for the first\nyear and subsequently the remaining eighty thousand on the second year\n\n\nYou will also be receiving an additional twenty thousand till the\nage of sixty five\n\n\nMoreover any two children will be covered for ten thousand upon\ndiagnosis of any of the critical illnesses\n\n\nAs for your son you will receive at least forty thousand after 20\nyears even if you or your wife is not around or when you are diagnosed of any\ncritical illnesses or if you are totally or permanently disabled\n\n\nBe proud of yourself Raymond", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f20a1141-898c-4811-a201-a01defe0bcb5", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.610759+00:00"}

I have last since the last time I\ncome up to your visit\n\n\nLooks like you are doing pretty well\n\n<$A> \n\nOh not not not too well actually\n\n\nMy business has been pretty bad\n\n<$B> \n\nOh is it\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause of the economic down turn and uh some cash flow\nproblem also\n\n<$B> \n\nOh is it but uh I uh I thought the when I uh I was driving in\njust now, I saw that you have actually extended your back end of your factory\ninto a double storey and then I saw I think you have put in a few line lines\nof machine\n\n\nI thought you were doing pretty well\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm I it was more for the long term but uh right now is\nrunning into difficulties because of all these extension\n\n<$B> \n\nOh I see\n\n\nIn that case you maybe you have expanded uh uh over expanded lah\nover the last last last two three years\n\n<$A> \n\nMaybe a bit too fast lah\n\n<$B> \n\nI see I see\n\n\nWell anyway this is not the you are not the only customer\n\n\nIn fact I was just visiting two other customers yesterday at the\nsomewhere around here Jurong and uh ya everybody looks like they have some\nproblem here and there\n\n\nEspecially with this economic crisis\n\n<$A> \n\nRight\n\n<$B> \n\nYa what what do you see of Indonesia\n\n\nDo you think Indonesia would be a would be of any help if they of\nany help to business or not if they really win over the elections and a more\nstable government is uh in place\n\n<$A> \n\nUh I think it is going to take time lah with all the violence\ngoing around there\n\n\nI I think is going even when a stable government is uh elected I\nthink it's still going to take years lah\n\n<$B> \n\nWell very sad man\n\n\nI mean as banker we uh we always hear this kind of comments make us\njittery man Anyway thanks for your uh uh allowing us to come by to visit you\ntoday\n\n\nActually uh uh we just want to come up to update with you uh as in\nour all annual exercises lah\n\n\nTo to update with you how is business and then we will also want to\ndiscuss a little regarding your credit facilities\n\n\nI think you have known uh if you have read the papers uh over the\npast few months uh in fact the local banks uh we are actually quite heavy\nladen with the with non-performing loans\n\n\nSo Sad to say but uh because of all these we are actually uh forced\nin certain ways to re-look into all the credit facilities granted to our\ncustomers so I think that is basically my objection my my objective today\n\n<$A> \n\nRight uhm uhm all right Mr Lim\n\n<$B> \n\nYa so actually I was uh in fact my colleague Samuel the other\nday have spoken to your secretary uh we are actually looking into to discuss\nwith you the possibility of reducing your current uh O D line with us\n\n\nCurrently you have one million so we are actually looking at\nreducing the line to eight hundred thousand\n\n\nI know it is a bit difficult but uh\n\n<$A> \n\nWa still have to reduce some more\n\n<$B> \n\nYa have to reduce\n\n\nAh so I know it is a bit difficult given the uh I mean just now\nlike what you say about times are bad and all that but we really really have\nto come up you know today to tell you basically these are some of the\nintention that the bank is adopting\n\n<$A> \n\nBut but my business is already so bad and I really have some\nstrict cash flow problem and all my facilities in this factory is being\nstretched to the maximum already and how can you come to me and tell me that\nyou need to reduce my O D line some more\n\n\nI just don't know lah\n\n\nI really don't know\n\n<$B> \n\nUh but actually what we can do is that we we uh we understand\nyour problem but we really hope that Mr Tan you could understand the position\nwe are in lah\n\n\nAlthough a lot of time people say that you know banks are you know\nduring rainy days uh we will take away the umbrella\n\n\nBut I hope you all can understand that uh we are also quite badly\nhit ah\n\n\nProperty value have all drop and all that\n\n\nIn fact all the all the case in fact ninety percent of our cases uh\nin our portfolio actually to use the term very crudely we are actually all\nunderwater\n\n\nWe are all struggling so we we understand we also understand your O\nD has been used up to the hilt and then at certain times also you actually\nwent over the limit but uh we are trying to see whether we can do a\nrestructure\n\n\nWe are not trying to say we want to bring it back down to two\nhundred lah you know within twenty-four hours\n\n\nWe are looking at a maybe a restructured payment say maybe five\nthousand per month something like that\n\n\nSomething that you are comfortable with hor and then at least uh\nyou know we could use this as a tool and then to tie tide over this period of\ntime\n\n\nFor all you know five thousand you know a month over over one year\nwe are looking at only sixty thousand\n\n\nSo we try to use it as a tool to buy time on your end as well as on\nthe bank's end\n\n\nThen hopefully that when the market recovers and then you know we\ncould reinstate back the line\n\n\nIn fact we have been doing this for some of our customers\n\n\nSo you can be rest assured you know we are not a wet weather bank\nbut uh we are here to do something that is beneficial on both ends huh\n\n\nI hope I hope this is a simple proposition that I can lay it before\nyou\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm sounds all right to me but but maybe I didn't say very\nstrongly that I really have serious cash flow problem and then I really\nexpanded a bit too fast, so that is being cutting into my uh cash and\nbusinesses and facilities too\n\n<$B> \n\nI see\n\n\nMaybe it is because of your investment in China\n\n\nI understand last year we actually granted you the additional O D\nand it was actually meant for some overseas investment in China\n\n\nI understand it was something like Shanghai\n\n\nHow is the development there or is it the other side is actually\nsucking up all the money\n\n<$A> \n\nActually to tell you the truth ya it is sucking quite a lot of\nmy cash\n\n<$B> \n\nOh dear I see\n\n<$A> \n\nFrom here\n\n<$B> \n\nI see\n\n\nSo if that is the case then I would suggest is that uh but coming\nback to the point again it is five I mean it is like what I said\n\n\nWe are not looking at two hundred thousand although this is uh you\nknow the initial idea that head office has imposed on your account but I am\nlooking at a maybe on gradual basis what about five thousand per month\n\n\nDo you think you can manage with that for the time being\n\n\nSo every month we reduce by five thousand lah so over a period of\none year we are looking at sixty thousand because if that is OK then maybe\nagain I cannot promise you this is this is only uh a decision on my end here\n\n\nIt may be approved it may not be approved\n\n\nBut I want to have I want to work out something that is more\ncomfortable so long as you are comfortable I think that is more important\n\n\nAt the end of the day you don't over commit yourself to the bank\nand then if you are something that you are comfortable you can fulfil I think\nthat is more important\n\n<$A> \n\nRight I understand that\n\n\nUhm five thousand sounds OK but I may have to like retrench some of\nmy workers\n\n<$B> \n\nWah in that case sounds quite bad if it is five thousand but I\nthink this is the best that I can do This is the best that I can do so uh\nanyway we will also take into consideration of the long relationship that you\nhave with us having bank with us for over the last twenty years beginning\nwith your father's time\n\n\nSo I ya ya I will also take in consideration of the possibility of\nyou know even if you have to retrench some of your staff if you go on a O D\nreduction\n\n\nAnyway I will try my very best Mr Tan\n\n\nWhat I do is that I will write a short report and then we give it\nto we see whether we can come back to you say within a week's time\n\n<$A> \n\nThat sounds fine\n\n<$B> \n\nWithin a week's time and then we see how we go from there\n\n\nIf really you have any problem then what we do is that after six\nmonths okay we will come back to you again and well we can sit down and then\ndiscuss further then\n\n\nI mean let us hope that the economy will recover by then because\nright now the biggest problem that we have is that we actually uh sitting on\na lot of properties like for example these factories that you have now uh\nlast year when I came in it was something like three point five million and\nthen today we are looking at two million so straightaway we are looking at a\nnegative network of about one point five million so this is the biggest\nheadache that we are facing\n\n\nSo I think not a problem lah\n\n\nDon't worry\n\n\nI mean I will come to you in say one week's time and then we see\nhow we go from there\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat about your bank\n\n\nYou said your bank is also affected\n\n<$B> \n\nOh banks we are affected we are affected\n\n\nUh in fact if you if you read the uh annual reports of all the\nlocal banks we are making hefty provision for the industries so we are badly\nhit\n\n\nWe are badly hit\n\n\nSo you know we are not spared lah\n\n\nOkay we are not spared lah\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm nice to know that I am not alone in all this\n\n<$B> \n\nYou are not spared okay\n\n\nWe are all business uh private organisations we are not spared but\nwe have to be prudent huh like living in Singapore we have to be prudent\n\n\nWe have to again uh we have to protect the interest of our\nshare-holders, depositors and all that lah but uh well never mind we see how\nit will it goes\n\n\nMore important I think we want to see that we can help our local\nenterprise here to ride through this bad times which is the reason why I have\nsaid we are always open for discussion although the intention is to reduce\nyour OD limit by two hundred thousand but I think we can always look into a\nrestructured payment\n\n\nFive thousand if it is too difficult for you we try it for six\nmonths\n\n\nAfter six months if you really have problems come back to us OK\nour doors are open anytime\n\n\nMy phone is also always there uh you can call me and then we can\nhave a discussion\n\n\nI mean the last thing that we want to do is to force you into\nliquidity problem\n\n<$A> \n\nAll right thanks\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay thanks Mr Tan uh we will not have lunch this time\n\n\nMaybe uh when I come back with you I will come back to you on the\ngood news the next week we can have lunch together\n\n<$A> \n\nYes that would be fine\n\n<$B> \n\nThanks a lot\n\n<$A> \n\nYa thanks a lot\n\n\nBye bye\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay

Sheila so we can get started\n\n\nI think Tan knows why uh he is here to capture the English used not\nthe Chinese used\n\n\nUhm I must say first I will have to leave by one forty-five so I am\ngoing to run through a little bit faster then maybe some of you anything you\nall want to discuss together as a group\n\n\nUh first of all the sports can I leave you to look after that after\nI have left\n\n\nUh a number of things that come up uh over the past week huh\n\n\nFirst of all the ranking of uh teachers huh I there is a new set of\nforms SAR forms that come out staff appraisal report forms\n\n\nUhm they are usual the usual thing are three types of forms is the\nuh the performance report <unclear> word </unclear> appraisal that's the\npotential and the third one is the work review\n\n\nSame thing but all three are all three have been revamped right\n\n\nUh to me it looks more difficult but according to ministry it says\nit's simpler\n\n\nMaybe it is because we are not familiar with the pattern format\n\n\nUhm but for this year just to let you know the ministry is changing\nthe schedule somewhat all right\n\n\nIn the past years the uh the SAR forms everything <unclear> word\n</unclear> at the end of the year\n\n\nAnd last year in February they asked us for the potential forms\n\n\nThey said the performance forms was only to be included\n\n\nTeachers whose performance grade is D or below\n\n\nSo we only had two forms last year\n\n\nUh this year they have asked for the uh potential form to be done\nin May right\n\n\nThe performance form if is if at all is need to be done but they\nhave not decided but if it should to be done it will be done at the end of\nthe year\n\n\nSo performance form will come at the end of the year potential will\nbe done at the end of May and the schedule will be out I will give you the\ndetailed schedule at a nearer date but just basically uh to let you know\nahead of time so that it won't come as a big shock\n\n\nWe need we need to do uh the teachers' ranking together with the\nremember we had a teachers' ranking session together with the uh inspectors\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nYou remember\n\n\nUh last year I can't remember when we did it but it was definitely\ntowards the end of the latter part of the year all right\n\n\nNow this year the performance ranking will be done uh quite early\n\n\nLet me just check my schedule for this year\n\n\nPerformance ranking I slotted the date for our school\n\n\nWe will be doing the ranking together with Brenda on the twentieth\nof May\n\n\nSo you may like to jot down the date on your diary twentieth of May\nright\n\n\nIt will probably start at two o'clock\n\n\nI will confirm this and the exact time later on\n\n\nSo twentieth May which means to say that uh we will have to have\nour pre-ranking done very much earlier\n\n\nNow ministry is supposed to have already sent me the pre-ranking\nform by yesterday\n\n\nI have not seen any anything yet uh it could be with the courier\nservice not arrive yet but uh the once it comes in and I get everything\nsorted out I will get this to you as quickly as as earliest possible so that\nyou got time to <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nMy guess either I look at it because there is there is not the\nusual twelve month gap between one ranking and the next\n\n\nThe potential can't be changed very much all right\n\n\nSo uh I did bring this up to the ministry that if we rank potential\nthen end of the year we rank uh performance 'cause performance is something\nelse because a teacher's performance can change quite drastically over one\nyear period\n\n\nBut I uh agree with them that the performance no the potential\nranking cannot changed very much especially since the lapse is about half a\nyear only\n\n\nSo uh I don't know whether you <unclear> word </unclear> but you\nprobably did quite Okay with that Unless <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nTwentieth May is for potential right\n\n<$A> \n\nPotential\n\n<$B> \n\nYou call us to uh\n\n<$C> \n\nPotential ranking\n\n<$A> \n\nPotential ranking\n\n\nWe are only going to potential ranking\n\n\nPerformance ranking will be end of the year if uh it may not come\nwith the form but the potential performance ranking definitely will be done\nat the end of the year all right\n\n\nMy uh the point that I brought up to the ministry is that there\nwill be some difficulty since this is the first time we are doing performance\nand potential quite far apart\n\n\nBecause uh remember we said that uh for an officer to be to be\nranked uh to be given a grade of sorry to be to be ranked on potential or\ngiven a potential of two grades higher\n\n\nLet's say a teacher was given a uh grade P6B for instance from P\ngrade to P6B cause P7 is HOD or SH LH P6B is VP right\n\n\nOK so if a teacher is given a potential grade of P6B from P8 it's\ntwo grades higher Two grades higher the performance grade must be at least a\nB all right\n\n\nRemember C is one grade up B is two grades up but now now that we\nare doing potential now and performance end of the year there may be cases of\ncontradiction all right\n\n\nSo uh this is to be <unclear> word </unclear> in mind when we do\nthe ranking all right\n\n\nBut uh we will do our pre-ranking this month later part of this\nmonth and then we try to do our internal ranking together\n\n\nUh of course inter-departmental ranking early next month in time\nfor Brenda to come and do final ranking with us on the twentieth all right\n\n\nThe rational behind this maybe I just point out the rational behind\nthis ministry is now thinking of doing appointments some time in the middle\nof the year all right\n\n\nSo if there should be any HODs appointed VPs or VPs appointed\nprincipals and so on their appointments for promotions and so on will become\nuh in this instance closer to the promotion date\n\n\nPromotion date is now fixed as first of April\n\n\nSo appointments will be some time in June July as well so that's\nwhy we are doing this otherwise unlike in the past all the appointments come\nquite late at the end of the year\n\n\nThey are also trying to change appointments of all other appointees\nother than the principals somewhere in the course of the year probably closer\nto the end of the year because if there is a lot of new appointments at the\nend of the year then it can cause a lot of disruption to the whole system all\nright\n\n\nSo whether that's good system or not I think that is debatable but\nthis is what they are going for all right\n\n\nSo uh cross ranking I have given you the date sorry ranking I have\ngiven you the date twentieth of uh\n\n<$C> \n\nMr Sim there will be another promotion exercise towards the\nlater part\n\n<$A> \n\nNo from now on there is only one promotion exercise\n\n<$C> \n\nBut uh over yesterday's news they said that there is another\npromotion exercise\n\n<$A> \n\nNo\n\n\nI think they are talking about appointments <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n\nI think it is not to be mixed up appointments with promotions\n\n\nFrom now on the appointments uh promotions will only be once a year\n\n\nOkay uh that's done\n\n\nNow cluster activities I have not asked you about this but uh in\nthe email to me some time last month uh we have been asked whether we would\nlike to take up cluster activities\n\n\nAnother words rather than organise things on our own we work as a\ncluster <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nWe save on organisational uh effort and also on cost all right\n\n\nSo at the moment two uh three items have crop up uh two concerning\nuh one concerning pupils and two concerning teachers\n\n\nI just list it out and then you note it down and see whether you\nwant to have this uh if you want to have this for your pupils then we will\nyou let me know so that we can I can book this with them\n\n\nAll right one is pupil student leadership\n\n\nStudent leadership actually Charlton has got a consultant and this\nconsultant is actually coming to see me tomorrow morning all right\n\n\nUh they are running a course two and a half day stay-in course on\nstudent leadership all right\n\n\nAnd uh the cost is not a big problem I think cost because we group\ntogether the cost per head will be less all right\n\n\nAnd uh at the moment we have uh fixed the date as twenty-fourth to\ntwenty-sixth of June\n\n\nTowards the latter part of the June holidays\n\n\nTwenty-fourth to twenty-sixth is actually a Thursday to Saturday so\ntwo and a half days and Saturday being a half day all right\n\n\nAnd they have also allocated a also arranged for the venue to be Ai\nTong School\n\n\nAi Tong has got a quite large uh compound so we are using Ai Tong\nbecause it also got a lot of special rooms including the threatrette that can\nseat two hundred people <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$C> \n\nWill it involve P6 pupils\n\n<$A> \n\nUh we have checked that\n\n\nWe will be remaining open but most of us felt that it should be P5\nbecause P5 pupils June quite close to streaming exam\n\n<$C> \n\nAh that's right\n\n<$B> \n\nP5 exam\n\n<$A> \n\nSo I think the target should be P5 P4 and P6 are out simply\nbecause it's too close to the exam\n\n\nSo it would be P5 pupils all right\n\n\nSo this is one\n\n\nThe other one is uh there was a course conducted by ministry of\nhealth on voice are for teachers\n\n\nI think you all familiar with this kind of picture\n\n\nUh some of our teachers applied separate uh initially a lot of the\nChinese teachers went through it and it was quite good\n\n\nThey found it helps\n\n\nUh we are asking whether the ministry of health the consultants can\nhold a course for our cluster because some of our teachers applied then\nturned down all right\n\n\nAnd they told us that they are willing to conduct for a three hour\nsession for one thousand dollars all right\n\n\nNow teachers applied I think will have to pay uh\n\n<$B> \n\nTwenty-five\n\n\nTwenty\n\n<$A> \n\nI think it's ten dollars\n\n\nHow much is that\n\n<$B> \n\nTwenty\n\n<$A> \n\nTwenty dollars per head so that means they are working on\nfifty people is it\n\n\nAll right\n\n\nUh they are telling us that uh one thousand dollars per session\nthey are not bothered about how many people we can have\n\n\nOne thousand people then is one dollar each\n\n\nSo uh it just a session for them and we thought this would benefit\nus as a cluster\n\n\nAt the moment we have uh we said that you open up to all the\ncluster schools and if we have five hundred people each one pays only two\ndollars\n\n\nBut we will probably arrange at a venue that is a bit more\nconducive rather than the school so at the moment two venues have cropped up\n\n\nOne is either Serangoon Country Club or the grassroot club at Ang\nMo Kio all right\n\n\nThey have got quite nice facilities and probably <unclear> word\n</unclear> if it's held in the afternoon then high tea all right uh all\nthrough me so this uh we have fixed the date as twenty-fifth June\n\n\nRight the last Friday of the school holidays\n\n\nSo we will publicise this to our teachers and find out how many\nare interested uh can you can you like\n\n\nSo I will ask Nancy to publicise this", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d05b95ac-538d-4fe3-ad7e-ee10bd5573f8", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nGood morning Mr Bek\n\n\nI'm glad that you are able to make it\n\n\nHave a seat Mr Bek\n\n\nYou said that you were recommended by Teo\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n\nMy friend Teo was impressed by your ability to market his house at\nsuch a good price as well and also so quickly too\n\n\nWhen he knew that I wish to sell my house he quickly called me to\ncontact you\n\n<$A> \n\nThat's nice of him\n\n\nThank you\n\n\nI would be most glad to help you market your house\n\n\nSo I believe that you are looking for a house\n\n<$B> \n\nOh yes I need you to get one for me\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nLet me tell you more of my house\n\n\nThe house I am staying now is a 5 I unit in Tampines\n\n\nIt's just passed five years\n\n\nI bought it for one hundred and twenty-three thousand dollars\n\n\nI wish to downgrade to a 4A or 4I unit in Tampines\n\n\nCan you please give me some advice so as to what I should do etc\n\n<$A> \n\nSure\n\n\nBasically the guidelines towards purchasing a resale flat in the\nopen market is quite simple\n\n\nSince you have a house it is easier at least on your finance\n\n\nBefore you get a loan from HDB they would want to use up all your\nCPF funds in the ordinary account before they lend to you\n\n\nSo we have to check whether you have the sufficient twenty percent\ndeposit required when you purchased the house as well as your income to\ndetermine the amount of loan available allowable for you\n\n\nOh\n\n\nIs your wife going to be the co-owner that is she is sharing in the\npayment of the house\n\n<$B> \n\nYes my wife will be my co-owner and will be sharing in paying\nfor the house\n\n\nWe have a combined CPF of about eighty thousand dollars in our\nordinary account\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n\nA 4a or 4I would fetch about two hundred and fifty thousand to two\nhundred and eighty thousand depending on the location the level whether it is\nat lift landing or not is it facing western/eastern sun etc\n\n\nQuite a number of factors will be involved in the pricing of the\nflat\n\n\nNot forgetting the renovation done to the house\n\n\nSo your eighty thousand dollars would easily cover the deposit of\nbetween fifty thousand to sixty thousand and also the stamp fees etc\n\n\nHow much are both of you earning now\n\n<$B> \n\nAs for myself my gross salary is two thousand five hundred a\nmonth and my wife's is about one thousand eight hundred a month\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd how much did you have to pay for your present five-room\nand how much have both of you paid so far\n\n<$B> \n\nOur present house cost us one hundred and seven-three thousand\nand we have paid so far about eight-six thousand dollars\n\n\nHow much can my house fetch now\n\n\nIs it somewhere three hundred and fifty thousand\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n\nThe market is about this amount\n\n\nWe have to call for valuation first\n\n\nAfter which we can decide to advertise the amount we wish to sell\n\n\nBut before that we should look out for your new house first\n\n\nIn this way you can be assured of sufficient time to renovate your\nnew place to move in just in time for you to hand the keys of your five-room\nflat to the new owner\n\n\nAll the process will take four months approximately but I will need\na total of six months to look for a house for you as well as marketing your\nfive-room\n\n\nAs for commission we charge a one per cent commission for helping\nyou to buy a flat and two per cent for selling your flat\n\n\nIf you agree on the terms spelt out can you please sign us an\nexclusive for marketing your house\n\n\nWhat do you think Mr Bek\n\n<$B> \n\nI think that is fine with me\n\n\nWhat do you need\n\n\nMy IC\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n\nThank you \n\n\n\n<$C> \n\nOkay Ming Chuan\n\n\nLim Ming Chuan still under medical leave\n\n\n<unclear> word </unclear>

\n\nNo I cannot afford so probably I would start uhm with the\nnewer ones ha\n\n<$A> \n\nThe newer ones ha\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nBut the newer ones uhm uhm actually it has been around for\nsome time also\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I know\n\n<$A> \n\nYa it also cost quite a lot and because you started so late\nand a lot of the figures that you may want would be very very difficult to\nfind\n\n<$B> \n\nI will just get those by which you can find first and the rest\nI will think later\n\n\nAnd depending on the price also\n\n<$A> \n\nOh yes\n\n<$B> \n\nSo how much are you selling yours\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm I always like new collectors to start their new collection\nand I always wish them to carry on because it is such uh uh to me it is a\nvery nice hobby\n\n\nI have been doing this for so many years\n\n\nSo I will give you a very reasonable price\n\n\nVery reasonable believe me\n\n\nYou will Okay we will talk about the price later but let us not\ntalk about that\n\n\nMaybe we talk about the figures and things like that\n\n\nSo the thing about the figures is it is very small but somebody\nlike to start with the dolls the twelve inch dolls\n\n\nI have a few here I can show you like this is Princess Leia all\nwhite and things like that\n\n<$B> \n\nNo I think I prefer the smaller ones\n\n<$A> \n\nThe smaller ones ha\n\n<$B> \n\nYes which is more expensive\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n\nBut maybe I suggest this\n\n\nThe thing to start with maybe a theme\n\n<$B> \n\nA what\n\n<$A> \n\nStart with a theme\n\n\nOkay for some people it would be too much for them to start with\n\n\nThey like to start with a certain scenario like uhm uhm certain\nguys I know they like the bounty hunters a lot\n\n\nThey appear in you know in the Empire Strikes Back\n\n<$B> \n\nIf I am not wrong I think is Boba Fett\n\n<$A> \n\nBoba Fett and uh a lot of other characters also Bousk and\nthings like that\n\n\nSo what I suggest one way you can do is go about doing this is uhm\nyou can actually get the bounty hunters first\n\n\nSet that scene you know set your scene because that is your\nfavourite scene\n\n<$B> \n\nYa ya\n\n\nIn fact I like them\n\n<$A> \n\nYa what else\n\n\nI know some of the girls believe me girls also come to my shop to\nbuy toys and things\n\n\nNot for their husbands or their boy friends but for themselves\n\n\nSo when you come in I am not surprised\n\n<$B> \n\nYa some of my friends do that too\n\n<$A> \n\nYa ya it is nice\n\n\nUhm uhm some of the girls they like Return of the Jedi\n\n\nEspecially the cute little guys the Ewoks\n\n<$B> \n\nYa ya\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know about that right\n\n<$B> \n\nI saw the cartoons\n\n<$A> \n\nSo what these what they do is that buy all the ewoks and they\ncreate a scene all from there and I have a special special play set over here\ncalled the Ewok Village that I import from the States\n\n\nAnd it is not it will not be made\n\n\nIt has not been made it has stopped manufacturing Ewok Village for\na long long time but I get in through them quite quite all right about fifty\ndollars\n\n<$B> \n\nFor how many\n\n<$A> \n\nIt just that Ewok Village with all the play sets\n\n\nLet me show you let me show you\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay it should be interesting\n\n<$A> \n\nYa like you see the net here the fireplace you know all the\nplace they stay in\n\n\nAnd you got traps here and things like that\n\n\nCatapults you know the place where they place the catapults the\ntree trunks and things like that\n\n\nSo you can get all the Ewoks and put on it and you can get your\nown little scenario is nice\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd they and they Kenner has made things that are very\nunusual lah you know\n\n\nThere is that like this is a combat glider\n\n\nYou know the part that you see in Return of the Jedi where Ewok\nwas on a glider and he threw stones on the Chicken Walkers and there are so\nmany other things\n\n\nSo that is one way you can start with\n\n<$B> \n\nI see\n\n<$A> \n\nYa ya or another way is that you go with your favourite\ncharacters\n\n\nWhat are the characters in Star Wars movies that you really like\n\n\nI have a friend a lady friend who likes Princess Leia a lot\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nYa and she comes in different uhm different uniforms and\nclothes and dresses and things like that\n\n\nSo what she does is that she only buys the Princess Leias\n\n\nAll different things or she buys the twelve dolls she buys all the\nfigures with Princess Leia\n\n\nSo she sticks with this\n\n<$B> \n\nI think it cost quite a lot right if I am not wrong\n\n<$A> \n\nNo if you go by theme in this way if you go by a certain\nscenario in this way it cost much less\n\n<$B> \n\nI see\n\n<$A> \n\nRather than to start from scratch and you buy everything\nthere is and you can't even find some of the things and I tell you some of\nthe things uhm they don't make now and they are very very expensive\n\n\nLike I have here maybe this particular Luke Skywalker with the\nlong sabre\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nWhen they first made it they made the long sabre and it is\nnot proportional with the with the size of the figures\n\n<$B> \n\nYa I heard about it\n\n<$A> \n\nYa ya so if you want to get back all these collectors' item\nthey are very difficult to find\n\n\nBut in another way if you are not particular about this\n\n\nThey're made this using short light sabre\n\n\nAnd uhm they don't cost a bomb\n\n\nThey cost about ten bucks each\n\n<$B> \n\nI see\n\n<$A> \n\nEasily manageable so you have to decide where where you want\nto start with\n\n<$B> \n\nI see okay\n\n\nWhat about Aliens uh\n\n<$A> \n\nOh Aliens okay\n\n\nI know about Aliens a lot because uh believe it or not I didn't\nstart with Star Wars when I started collection\n\n\nI actually started with Aliens\n\n<$B> \n\nI see\n\n\nI like the shows a lot you know\n\n<$A> \n\nYa the movies are great right\n\n<$B> \n\nYa but I know the toys are very rare now\n\n\nYou cannot get it anywhere\n\n<$A> \n\nOh ya very difficult to get\n\n<$B> \n\nDo you sell them by the way\n\n<$A> \n\nI do I do\n\n\nI do sell them and sometimes on and off I try to locate them from\noverseas and I try to bring them in to Singapore\n\n\nBecause there's still a lot of collectors are there who are very\nkeen on Aliens stuff\n\n<$B> \n\nYa ya ya\n\n\nI like the show very much\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I love it too\n\n\nAnd incidentally that's how I started toy collection\n\n<$B> \n\nFrom Aliens\n\n<$A> \n\nFrom Aliens ya\n\n\nSo so we have talked a lot so are you going to get today or do you\nwant to wait another day to get\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm probably another day lah\n\n<$A> \n\nAnother day\n\n<$B> \n\nI have to think about what I really want\n\n<$A> \n\nCorrect\n\n\nSo thing remember to me toys you know always bring people together\n\n\nThat to me is the important thing about toys so\n\n<$B> \n\nThat is nice\n\n<$A> \n\nYa don't be too interested in the values uhm the you know the\nmarket price of the toy and things like that\n\n\nIt take away the joy out of it\n\n\nGet it get something that you really like\n\n\nSomething that reminds you of the good old days bring back\nmemories or something that you really like in a movie like Star Wars scenes\nand things like that\n\n\nGet those\n\n\nGet things that are closer to your heart\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nInstead of getting things that people tell you to get because\nthey are very good price because next time would fetch a good price\n\n\nNext time would fetch a higher price\n\n<$B> \n\nNo it is not that reason I like toys\n\n<$A> \n\nYa it's not fun at all\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nDon't do that like for me when I was young how I get into\ntoys was this\n\n\nI don't have much money so my parents only very occasionally buy\nme one or two Star Wars toys and I play them and play them over and over\nagain and I still have them and I keep them as memories and things like that\n\n\nAnd when I grew up I told myself that when I start to earn money\nagain I would go back to collect the things the toys that I really really\nlike\n\n\nSo that's what toys mean are to me\n\n<$B> \n\nI see\n\n<$A> \n\nMemories the good old days and things that I really like and\nit brings people together\n\n\nSo remember this when you think about the toys\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nThanks a lot\n\n<$A> \n\nNice talking to you is been very very fun\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$A> \n\nIt has been very fun talking about toys\n\n\nI don't normally get customers to come in here and I can talk\nabout toys so much\n\n\nSo so it is been very very fun\n\n\nHere is my name card\n\n\nUhm call me anytime so we are open from nine eh no from twelve to\nabout seven o'clock each day except Monday because that is the day we rest\nand uhm uhm we try to hunt around for toys\n\n<$B> \n\nI see \n\n<$A> \n\nSo uhm if you need anything just call us we can reserve\nthings for you or we can bring them from overseas\n\n\nRemember I told you before also ah I also charge you a reasonable\nprice\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay so I will bring down my friend\n\n\nUhm uhm can I bring my friend along\n\n<$A> \n\nOh sure\n\n<$B> \n\nYa so probably a Sunday lah\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay that will be good\n\n<$B> \n\nAre you open that day\n\n<$A> \n\nYes definitely\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nYa I look forward to seeing you on that day again\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay see you

Indonesians the lead\n\n\nFafri Husaini the man to open counts for Indonesia and that\nhas not only taken David by surprise\n\n\national Stadium by complete surprise\n\n\nSo the Indonesians take an early lead in the eighth minute of this Asian\n\nCup Group four qualifying round\n\n\nIs this going to set Singapore back or will this sting ramp into retaliation\n\n\nWe hope that they have the character to pull the game up now\n\n<$B> \n\nThey'd better because if they lose this they don't even have one point\nafter two matches and if China beat Malaysia that automatically eliminates\nSingapore\n\n\nThen China will have taken four points\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd Coverchecks certainly looks like very dejected a person at the moment\n\n\nNo team official would like to see his team going or trailing the opposition\nin such an early time in this match with only eight\nminutes of play gone by the Indonesians getting themselves into the lead\n\n\nCan Pabanathan once again inspire the boys onto the equalizer\n\n\nLatif Abdullah and Eunos Moktar is there for Indonesia\n\n\nHadiyono Hadiyono once again\n\n\nPabah collecting it very calmly\n\n\nHaslim Kannan\n\n\nRazali Said moving up right now\n\n\nHe's got Devaraj on the right and he makes uses of Devaraj\n\n\nHe's across coming in\n\n\nYes he does and Eddie Haditono beats\nKannan to the ball first to the ball Eddie Hato\n\n\nThis is that one man who's gotta gotta prove to be a real\nstumbling block to the Singapore team in their search for the equaliser\n\n<$B> \n\nIt's not just Eddie Hato\n\n\nThe warning signs were there earlier on\n\n\nThe Indonesians were going in harder\n\n\nThey seem half a step fast and I think to goal\n\n\nIf we do get to see it again you'll see that the defenders back off the number\nnine Widodo Putro and he ran all the way into the box before he laid that\nball back for Pakri to take that shot and it was too well placed for David\n\n\nIt's right in the side netting\n\n<$A> \n\nZainal Pamah Deveraj back to his captain\n\n\nHaslim Devaraj missing that one\n\n\nIndonesia saying thank you very much and come away once again\n\n\nSydney Pitono looking for Husaini\n\n\nHaslim down in defence\n\n\nThe Indonesians are just toying around in the Singapore defence looking for\nplayers who are running into open spaces just uh picking their men up and\nknocking the ball around\n\n\nHusaini up front still ahead\n\n\nPamah tidying up for Singapore\n\n\nTong Hai giving it to David Lee\n\n\nPutiray for you and now Razali Said\n\n\nZainal there's gonna be some switch of uh players\n\n\nTong Hai I notice has moved over to the left\n\n\nPull back position\n\n\nZanial from the left pull back position has moved over to the right\n\n\nPamah must have uh made a couple of uh decisions on the spur of the moment\n\n\nLooking at the Indonesians who are moving around menacingly especially\nPuteray and Hitomo the Indonesian's number nine and ten\n\n\nSudirman\n\n\nIt's a long one opening up the game\n\n\nOver to Puteray\n\n\nGoing nowhere except to Singapore's captain Zainal\n\n\nLatiff Abdullah the shortest player but he's reputed to be the fittest\nplayer in the Singapore side\n\n\nHe's been given the opportunity to prove to prove that to the more than \nthirty-five thousand fans here in the National Stadium today\n\n\nAnd another menacing Indonesian attack hitting the upright going out of\nplay off for Singapore and it's going to be the first corner the\nfirst corner for the Indonesians in fact\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd that was a long time coming but once again you can see that number\nseven man Widodo Putro\n\n\nHe had just too much time\n\n\nThe all the defenders were just backing off and giving him all the time\nin the world to run right through\n\n<$A> \n\nThe Indonesians taking their first corner\n\n\nWidodo Putro\n\n\nQuarter of an hour gone by\n\n\nIf you have just joined us let me tell you that uh Singapore are trailing\nIndonesian by one goal to nil\n\n\nThe goal coming in the eighth minute through Fafri Husaini\n\n\nFree kick to the Indonesians inspired by that uh early goal\n\n\nThey're going to be piling on the pressure on this Singapore side\n\n\nRazali organising his defence\n\n\nPapa Nathan the Indonesians referee and they fail to keep that ball in place\n\n\nNearly a goal kick to Singapore\n\n<$B> \n\nBy the way the game is going now one doesn't give Singapore much of a hope\n\n\nThey seem to be disorganised\n\n\nLatiff I presume he's nervous on his debut\n\n\nHe's been a a trifle too anxious and I hope he settles down and has a\ngood game\n\n<$A> \n\nK Kannan for Singapore\n\n\nHaslim Harom right now picking up\n\n\nDevaraj and Devar is another one of those players who has yet to settle down\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd he hasn't\n\n\nHis touches have been a bit slack\n\n\nHe hasn't played the ball with any conviction and he has left it short on\na couple of occasions\n\n<$A> \n\nThe ever reliable Pamah Nathan\n\n\nGood pressure on the Indonesians giving possession to Singapore\n\n\nHasnian sending Kannan through uh Tuckey John it is\n\n\nAnd what is it\n\n\nThe refugee place advantage\n\n\nTuckey John lost his balance\n\n\nHaji Santoso for Indonesia\n\n\nThe Singapore boys should apply a lot more pressure on the Indonesians uh\nespecially in the middle of the park like what they did just a little\nwhile ago thereby winning the ball once again\n\n\nBut right now they seem to be taking things in their stride and just\ndictating the pace of the game\n\n\nThe Indonesians seem to be uh playing the ball around so easily without\nmuch pressure really from the Singapore side\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd that relates your observation which is a good one Brian \nThey're best\n\n\nThey're just backing off\n\n\nThey're not going in hard and you know challenging the Indonesians\n\n\nI rather suspect they're afraid of the the pace\n\n\nThe Indonesians do have some very pacey boys and they're just giving\nthem you know an extra yard or two which Indonesians right now are\ntaking full advantage of\n\n<$A> \n\nWell the boys are falling into the same trap as in the in their opening\nmatch against Malaysia where they were back dabbling especially so in\nthe first half and they allowed the Malaysians to take complete control\nof the first forty-five minutes\n\n\nAnd that's exactly what's happening here\n\n\nA repeat of the first half in Singapore's open tie against Malaysia\n\n\nBut fortunately for Singapore yes Latiff Abdullah with the first real good\nattempt at the Indonesian goal\n\n\nLatiff Abdullah giving some hope for their Singapore fans here in the\nNational Stadium\n\n\nWe'll watch that again\n\n\nA very ambitious a very brave attempt by Latiff Abdullah\n\n<$B> \n\nHe's got the right idea\n\n\nHe might have to get in a bit closer because he's not going to be a goalie\nlike Eddie Hato from that kind of range unless it's a a phenomenal shot\nwhich just finds a top corner or something\n\n<$A> \n\nBut at least uh our strikers ought to take the cue from Latiff Abdullah\nand uh start shooting outside because otherwise if you have too much\nrespect for Haltoh you'll never get the goals without trying\n\n\nThe fans getting a little impatient right now where Singapore trail the\nIndonesians from an early lead given by Fafri Husaini in the eighth minute\nof play\n\n\nSo the Indonesians are leading Singapore one goal to nil after twenty\nminutes of this first half and the Indonesians are pulling back once again\n\n\nRozali Sahad puts his <unclear> word </unclear> away Widodo Putra giving\npossession to Eunos Moktar and right now Sudirman\n\n\nUp front for Pitono Haslim\n\n\nTong Hai sending it away to touch for a throw in to the Indonesians\n\n\nThe Indonesians seem to be enjoying dictating the game and our Singapore\nwill have to do something about the opportunity of uh taking advantage\nof possession as they move up instead of giving those balls away\n\n\nLatiff Abdullah looking for Devaraj Haslim up front for Kannan and he is\nat an outside position\n\n\nDavid Lee has come back once again\n\n\nSudirman\n\n\nThey seem to be quite happy just retaining possession\n\n\nAs long as you have possession there's nothing the opposition can do\nand this is exactly the predicament that the Singapore boys are in at\nthe moment\n\n<$B> \n\nHe's compounding the effect that they're trailing one nil\n\n\nThey got to get the ball back somehow\n\n\nAnd they're still allowing the Indonesians way too much space\n\n<$A> \n\nA good block there by Abdullah Latiff and now Singapore have the ball\nonce again\n\n\nTong Hai Zainal or that's Deva Deva once again\n\n\nRazali Said Kannan and a chance here for Singapore\n\n\nOh yes\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's a great goal\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat a brilliant goal there scored by Razali Said\n\n\nA saving equalizer from Razali Said and that came about in the\ntwenty-second minute of play\n\n\nOh we just love to watch that again\n\n\nWhat a beauty of a goal\n\n\nWhat a beauty of a strike\n\n<$B> \n\nOh my god look at that brilliant and that was the first really good move\nthat Singapore had\n\n\nThey knocked the ball above beautifully stringing their passes together\n\n\nAnd that was unstoppable unstoppable\n\n<$A> \n\nNow Razali Said has been known to have scored goals from what uh twenty\nthirty metres out and there you are\n\n\nHe has just proven very well\n\n\nThat's uh what a relieve indeed for Mish Covercheck\n\n\nSo that puts Singapore back on terms and the teams are back to square\none once again giving Singapore some hope in their second match in this\nAsian Cup Group four qualifying round\n\n\nAnd I just love the way Razali Said picked his spot and pelted the ball in\n\n\nIn fact we have seen two great goals today\n\n<$B> \n\nYah two excellent shots\n\n\nI don't think the goal either goalie had a chance in the two goals\n\n\nSpark Preeze was deep in the the side netting and the ball actually stuck\nthere trapped between this tension and the net and Razali's was unstoppable\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd the fans are certainly celebrating with the Kallang wave\n\n\nThis is our very own version of the Mexican wave\n\n\nOh yes\n\n\nWhat joy\n\n\nWhat celebration from the terraces\n\n\nAnd back to play right now but the Indonesians are coming back relentlessly\n\n\nThey are attacking in waves as well\n\n\nThey certainly want to win this match after having lost to China in\ntheir opening tie\n\n\nTwo players committing themselves but uh Terry Pathanathan is so so\nfor sure that he goes in\n\n\nHe knows that he's gonna get the ball and he gets it\n\n\nWhat a first half this is turning out to be\n\n\nBoth teams starting off very cautiously but with Indonesians taking\nSingapore by surprise in the eighth minute with a goal from Husaini\nsuddenly found their lead being cancelled by Razali Said with a\nreally marvellous goal that had Eddie Hato beaten\n\n\nThere was no chance at all\n\n\nTong Hai going up for that one save inside\n\n\nZainal was there doing good service for Singapore\n\n\nTheir tails are up and now they're putting on a spur of display for\nthe more than thirty-five thousand fans here at the National Stadium\nas Singapore go the attack\n\n\nHaslim Harun at the farside gets his cross in\n\n\nTocky John only down for Aldi Santoso and from there it goes to Moktar\n\n\nThat's the Russian coach in charge of this Indonesian side\n\n\nOh an opportunity that gave Indonesia's way to give them the lead once\nagain but this time David Lee was certainly on his toes\n\n\nHe read that very well\n\n<$B> \n\nYes he did and he's quick off his line and if he wasn't there that\nwould have been two one to Indonesia Well played by David \n\n<$A> \n\nSo now Singapore with that uh saving goal from Razali Said have a\nglimmer of hope once again with Indonesians taking the Singapore\nteam off their strive regaining possession they come back once\nagain Husaini but he fails to beat Haslim this time Zulkifli\nand Razali Said they're back at the moment", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

Cup competition and they're\nwell on their way to the final in Hiroshima this October\n\n\nRozali Saad for Singapore now\n\n\nAnd hopefully we should be there to bring you all the action\n\n\nNasri Rozali gaining control of the ball giving position to the\nPeople's Republic of China once again\n\n\nEddy Kum tearing back into the Singapore defence now\n\n\nWeiguo over to Mengwa\n\n\nChaoyang Chiupo\n\n\nHe's another one of those stars for this uh Chinese side playing\nfor his country for many years now\n\n\nAnother goal kick to Singapore and it's a question of time as to\nhow long the boys will be able to weather the storm with the Chinese applying\nearly pressure already in this match\n\n\nThe outcome certainly has got no bearings on their qualifying for\nthe finals but still they would like to go up out of the competition with a\nclean slate winning all their matches against Indonesia Malaysia and now\nSingapore\n\n\nFree kick to Singapore to be taken by Zukifli Catiomo and the\nplayers move up now the white shirts go to the top of the Chinese penalty box\n\n\nDevaraj turning it round <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nTim no problems whatsoever for O Chiuliang\n\n\nMengwa\n\n\nChiupo Chaoyang\n\n\nWhen we talk about total football just watch this Chinese team\nplayers who are slated down to play in mid-field there\n\n\nDown to defence there up in the striker's position in the next\nmoment they're all over\n\n\nEach and everyone of these players in this uh Chinese side put in a\nlot uh hard work\n\n\nTremendous work rate here displayed by these Chinese boys\n\n\nAnd Singapore conceding a corner\n\n\nTeng Weiguo to lift the ball from the corner blight <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n\nGood sliding tackle by Elsri getting Singapore out of trouble\n\n\nHaslim Ipichil looking for Devaraj and now Nasri\n\n\nGood cover by Mengwa\n\n\nAi zhiao\n\n\nSaid Devaraj and the boys in their eagerness to try and take\ncontrol of the game seem to be making a lot of mistakes and uh giving away\npossession to China\n\n\nFrom Said Shuko to Rozali\n\n\nSaad back to Said Shuko\n\n\nBasically a stopper he seems to be the rightful back position\n\n\nCaber check they still using his three two three two formation but\nthey've got to be a lot tighter in defence applying of course the zonal\ndefence to try and shut up the Chinese attack\n\n\nChee Mengwa Liyong Chineng\n\n\nOh that's Chaoyang\n\n\nYijeng\n\n\nMengwa\n\n\nChuipo they're trying to draw the Singapore forwards <unclear> word\n</unclear> of the Singapore players toward them before trying to prize open\nthe defence looking for gaps in the Singapore defence and they've conceded\nanother corner <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nThat one in Hasmil gets it away\n\n\nKannan keeping his balance very nicely there despite the challenge\nand here's Haslim Harun\n\n\nYes he's got an option there in the person of Nasri\n\n\nDevaraj asking for for the ball but Nasri decides to hit for goal\nand the ball has gone out for a goal kick to the People's Republic of China\n\n\nGood attempt by Nasari Nasir and the Chinese come back once again\n\n\nIt is pretty evident that the Chinese are holding back\n\n\nThey're just waiting for the right ball to strike and the Singapore\ndefenders especially will have to be very very weary\n\n\nThey knocked the ball around in the middle of the field but when\nthey get it to the <unclear> word </unclear> third of the field they will\njust accelerate their pace and great focal\n\n\nHalim for Singapore looking for support\n\n\nHe gets it from Devaraj and good return to Haslim and he's got one\nplayer to beat with two others coming back and that's Chuiliang making sure\nalthough that ball looked destined to go out for a goal kick but Chuiliang\nnevertheless went down for that\n\n\nSlow build-up as usual\n\n\nChaoyang very nicely taken there away by Tonghai it comes back once\nagain to Weiguo on the outside for Chaoyang and David gets to the ball first\nahead of Chienli\n\n\nZukifli\n\n\nTonghai\n\n\nWe see a lot of central defenders in the Singapore today\n\n\nIn fact uh the defence is made up essentially of uh central\ndefenders\n\n\nThere's Depamanathan who is uh playing the sweeper's role\n\n\nThen there's Lim Tonghai Said Shuko Noor Halishafik and Rozali Saad\n\n\nThey're all central defenders\n\n\nThis Chinese squad has been under intensive training in uh\nGuangzhou in preparation for this competition\n\n\nAnd as part of their preparations they played against the United\nStates and Canada losing five nil to the US team and five two to Canada\n\n\nBut uh as we've seen they're they're all set to give a good account\nof themselves in Hiroshima\n\n\nYes the team comes from Guangtong but uh their preparations were in\nGuangzhou\n\n\nThey've got only three players from Beijing in this squad\n\n\nChiupo forward to Chienli\n\n\nYishin this is Yishin\n\n\nPamanathan yes Pamanathan playing a real captain's game\n\n\nTonghai\n\n\nNoor Haliz back to David Lee and the Singapore defenders are\ncertainly taking their chances there in the defensive third of the field\nknocking the ball around\n\n\nThey sure look pretty confident with their skills\n\n\nGone away with that one especially in the face of the fast running\nYishin\n\n\nYishin once again Noor Haliz trying to get to the ball first but\nhe was prevented from doing so good shielding by Yishin and of course he was\npulled off for tackling from behind so a free kick given to the People's\nRepublic of China\n\n\nThey push most of their players up into the Singapore penalty box\nSaid goes up with that one and Tonghai the second time\n\n\nTonghai once again and out it goes for a goal kick to Singapore\n\n\nNoor Haliz he was rested in uh Singapore's last match against\nIndonesia\n\n\nSaid Devaraj\n\n\nRozali Saad the Chinese players are extremely fast\n\n\nYou see them putting the pressure on the Singapore players in the\nmiddle of the pitch\n\n\nThey don't allow the Singapore players to get into their penalty\narea before they shut them out\n\n\nThey shut them out right there in the middle of the <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n\nThey apply the pressure all the away\n\n\nThey don't give the Singapore boys room to manoeuvre\n\n\nAnd Chineng just gave that away and I'm sure the Singapore\ndefenders are grateful for that\n\n\nGoal kick to Singapore\n\n\nWe've got about fifteen minutes of play gone by and still\nSingapore is still holding their on\n\n\nNo goals at the moment\n\n\nInterception by Chuipo Tonghai comes back and Pama gears for\nNazarene\n\n\nHaslim\n\n\nHaslim once again\n\n\nKannan's making his move\n\n\nHe leaves the ball off the side\n\n\nHe gets it from Razali and now Kannan in possession\n\n\nYou see how the Chinese players cover all those passing and those\nmaking it very very difficult for the player on the ball to look for his\nteam-mates\n\n\nPamanathan sending that one to the middle of the box and it's get\naway to safety\n\n\nOh good play by Devaraj\n\n\nHe's through a promising move there by Dedevaraj and he certainly\nraise the hopes of the twenty thousand fan here at the National Stadium at\nleast for a moment as Singapore move into the offensive and uh very nearly\nmade something out of that move\n\n\nThe Singapore boys will have to be uh a lot more assured\n\n\nTonghai with a big header\n\n\nA tackle by Said\n\n\nSaid Shuko giving away a free kick to China\n\n\nHe certainly had his eye Maichiao couldn't allow Maichiao to take\ncontrol of the ball\n\n\nThis is the man who orchestrate all the goals for China\n\n\nWeiguo still taking possession Ai chao slip that one in to number\nsix Yichun\n\n\nGood play by Depamanathan Norhaliz\n\n\nKannan to Haslim Tonghai switching play to Saad Shuko\n\n\nPakma Devaraj and Devaraj committing an error there couldn't\ndecide which way the ball was going\n\n\nVery good one-touch play by the Chinese\n\n\nThey're running off\n\n\nThe ball is certainly a treat for all soccer fans\n\n\nGet the ball hit it and then run into <unclear> word </unclear>\nspaces for the return\n\n\nSaid Shuko was there\n\n\nChuipo with the throw-in\n\n\nPamanathan reads the game very very well\n\n\nNoor Haliz did a bit of playing\n\n\nDavid I'm sure will want to acquit himself well today as he says\nthat this is gonna be his swan song\n\n\nNoor Haliz glad to be playing in the left pull back position with\nuh Saad Shuko taking care of the rightful back position\n\n\nThe Chinese coming back once again\n\n\nYijun\n\n\nNoor Haliz\n\n\nVery careful play there by Noor Haliz and he decides to draw\n<unclear> word </unclear> for a goal\n\n\nDavid Lee stopping that\n\n\nAlmost off the line and he hit upright\n\n\nA good attempt there by Li Chaoyang\n\n\nWe'll watch the action replay on that one\n\n\nA chance given to Chaoyang by Noor Haliz\n\n\nHe went for goal\n\n\nFortunately David was in corner of that time and he prevented\nChina from taking the lead\n\n\nBack to play and China given a free kick and that was because uh\nSaid Shuko uh tackled one of the Chinese players from behind so a free kick\ngiven to the People's Republic of China\n\n\nThe Singapore boys are all down into their defence\n\n\nNo one is up even Kannan and there's Devaraj in front their kicker\n\n\nLiyong Rozali gave that away\n\n\nOh and here's the danger man failing to keep in playing\n\n\nThat's uh Xie Yishin\n\n\nThe twenty-three year old Yishin who has

triads with uh Jocky John falling down getting\nhimself up again but Trengganu now ledging themselves to this ball and\ncrossing it into the Singapore half\n\n\nSingapore rushing down to defend\n\n\nStill with the ball a long try\n\n\nThis must come from this man uh Zabric I think it is\n\n\nNow the near side number fifteen Rosli Ishak\n\n\nThe man we saw coming in just now Nodi <unclear> word </unclear> of\nSingapore managing to swat that attack down to Haskin Harun\n\n\nHaslim from the centre\n\n\nHe streams <unclear> word </unclear> off the ball extremely well\ndown to Wing Onn on that very far side\n\n\nWing Onn trying to beat one man that man is Hasnan Ahmad\n\n\nHe doesn't quite get way pass that man and so Trengganu now\nretaliate from their own half trying to get away\n\n\nReferee saw that bit of pushing there uh by uh let's see now it was\nuh Zukifli and he has awarded a free kick for Trengganu uh in their own half\njust just about centre of their own half\n\n\nBall quickly taken\n\n\nBall goes down to Tusma Hosmak and Hosmak uh due to <unclear> word\n</unclear> sends it back to his skipper Zubit Ibrahim\n\n\nWith great force uh challenging him in

was a bit\n<unclear> word </unclear> going around\n\n\nHere we have Malin Randa and there seem to be a little fight here\nRoklin with Steven Daivd Lee coming in the thick of it all\n\n\nMalin Vandasanda getting a little bit hot behind the collar growing\nin the <unclear> word </unclear> there\n\n\nBut I think the referee has got the situation well in control\n\n\nThe police are coming and bar them on the track\n\n\nThe referee will certainly have to give the red card at least to at\nleast one or two one Singaporean I think also\n\n\nBut uh well let's see how the referee handle this situation\n\n\nHe's got Malin Vandasanda pulled into the side and he's also got\nSaid Shuko now Said Shuko was also instrumental in that little bit of flare\nup\n\n\nSaid Shuko was brought down and now they've got their names taken\nin the infamous book of the referee let's see the colour of the card that\ncomes off\n\n\nWell you know looking from that angle they're now shifting my eyes\nto the left we see drinks coming in and both the teams sharing a cup or two\n\n\nWe have Temas Hosmak\n\n<$A> \n\n\n\nA yellow card uh awarded to both Malin Vandasanda and Sye Said\nShuko\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's pretty mild I would say because uh it was uh almost\nbordering on uh a fist fights here at the National Stadium and I think a\nyellow card to uh Malin Vandasanda and Singapore's Said Shuko I guess is a\nfair a fair decision\n\n\nBut nevertheless having said that we still have that man in\nTrengganu still on the ground\n\n\nHe's been there for the past three or four minutes\n\n<$A> \n\nand he is uh Rosli Ishak\n\n<$B> \n\nRight the man we saw coming in just will <unclear> word\n</unclear> replacing Arifin Osman he was a man uh uh well I wouldn't say\ninstrumental but at least he was in the thick of it all the cause of little\nuh fracas here at the National Stadium\n\n\nNow he's been uh uh place on a stretcher and uh carried off by four\n\n\nI think they must be from Saint Saint John's ambulance\n\n\nBrian\n\n<$A> \n\nUh one of the reasons uh Malin Vandasanda lost his uh cool for\na moment was because uh Said Shoko the man who uh inflicted that uh injury on\nRosli Ishak and hadn't scratched it out but oh but he's up and he's back into\nthe field of play once again so it makes you wonder whether that was serious\nenough to warrant that incident\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know Brian that is the epitome of play acting\n\n<$A> \n\nAs I was saying uh Malin Vandasanda is very very frustrated\nbecause Said Shuko has been doing an extremely good job of shackling him and\nuh this of course uh gave him the opportunity of uh pushing Said Shuko and\ntrying to take the law into his own hands\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know uh it is very very humourous because there was Rosli\nIshak in the thick of it all\n\n\nHe was trying to gain the sympathy of the referee\n\n\nHe was lying motionless on the field of play for about three\nminutes\n\n\nHe even had the stretcher transported from the field of play out of\nthe field of play and when he looked around he had found that everyone a\nyellow card\n\n\nHe bounced back got himself off the stretcher and ran back and took\nup position\n\n\nNow that is I think uh warrants a contract a contract probably with\nSBC\n\n\nI've seen a lot of things in these past years Brian but that I\nthink I must really take my hat off to him\n\n\nOn the you you gonna say something are you\n\n<$A> \n\nWell anyway well he didn't want to see his team down uh to ten\nmen and uh in fact he sees a replacement for Arifin Osmund so he had to get\nback into the thick of action\n\n<$B> \n\nWell now it's Trengganu then one uh is uh well have ball is\ngot the ball shot right across the head of uh Zulkifi\n\n\nIt still uh uh little bit of dangerous situation for Singapore\nbecause the action was dated back\n\n\nNow Greg Foster Greg Foster for letting a true ball on the far side\nof the field\n\n\nCan Jocky John get himself to the ball\n\n\nNo he can't\n\n\nGreg was in for the for second attempt then\n\n\nHe gets himself to the ball then a very side\n\n\nIs that uh uh Ushami Lock Wing Onn\n\n\nNow on the near side here this is <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nThe long ball coming to the sidelines here grim slightly uh uh\nTrengganu half\n\n\nHasni trying to get it back into play again a push out to touch\n\n\nAnd Hasim will just have to content with just a throw in\n\n<$A> \n\nWell the pace of this uh match is really fast and furious as\nboth teams go for one another\n\n\nSingapore desperately needing to win Trengganu trying to hold on to\nat least a goal as draw and come away with a point\n\n\nShare points here with Singapore in Singapore's home tie in this\nsemi-pro cup tie against Trengganu and there's still no score at the moment\n\n\nTrengganu in attack a long ball <unclear> word </unclear> the top\nof the Singapore penalty area to the head of Malin Vandasandan who knocks it\ndown to Wan Izila keeps it in play and he sends it to Rosli Ishak back to Wan\nIzila\n\n\nIzila's his ball across the ball to Malin Vandasandan and it's the\nboys Sulia Dali into the middle of the pitch it goes\n\n\nIt's anybody ball as the ball uh keeps on <unclear> word </unclear>\nand leaving and Haslim Harun picks it up and he went straight into the\nTrengganu defence defeats one two three but not the third man\n\n\nHe was beaten there by the Trengganu defender Zabri Mohammud Nor\ndoing very well\n\n\nRosli Ishak picks it up in mid-field right now but he couldn't keep\ncontrol of the ball it goes to touch\n\n\nCorner throw in to Singapore to be taken by Singapore's left\nquarter-back Sudia Dali\n\n\nDali very quickly down to Foster\n\n\nFoster juggling the ball looking for a teammate\n\n\nHe finds Zulkifli\n\n\nZulkifli sending it back to Foster\n\n\nThe goal-keeper was out of position\n\n\nThat's the reason why the crowd <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nFoster to get on with the game and uh apparently the defender who\nstopped Haslim from uh going through on his own was Zabri Mohammud Nor\n\n\nHe's flat on the ground and the goal-keeper Zubir Ibrahim wanted to\nbring the referee's attention to this injured player Zabri Mohammud Nor and\nhe was completely out of position whereas the referee allowed play to\ncontinue and he was in a situation where he would have been out of position\nhad uh Foster crossed the ball earlier and Singapore would have scored and he\nwas very very upset\n\n\nHe wanted to go for the referee but one of his defenders stopped\nhim from doing so and attention now that play has been halted\n\n\nttention has been given to this injured player Zabri Mohammud Nor\nand he's been taken care of\n\n\nRight now the stretcher boys are on the pitcher play and they've\ngot him on a stretcher and he's got to go to the far side of the field\n\n\nIn the meantime uh I think a goal kick is gonna be given to\nTrengganu\n\n\nWe've got something like uh thirty-five thirty-six minutes of play\ngone by thirty-six minutes of play gone by in this second-half\n\n\nTrengganu nil Singapore nil\n\n\nGoal kick taken by their keepers Zabir Ibrahim right into the\nmiddle of the pitch it goes\n\n\nSingapore picking it up\n\n\nHaslim Harun with the ball relays it to Foster\n\n\nFoster down to Wing Onn yes and a shot here\n\n\nA golden opportunity for Singapore to score and Wing Onn turned\naround very quickly with his left leg he putted towards his Trengganu goal\n\n\nThe goal-keeper was out of position but uh fortunately for\nTrengganu the ball went high and wide for a goal kick\n\n\nSo they live again to fight and they intend to do just that as\nthey match Singapore in pace and determination keeping their score lying\nclean\n\n\nNo score at the moment\n\n\nSingapore desperately needing to win as Trengganu come back right\nnow\n\n\nMalin Vandasanda with the ball\n\n\nIn the Singapore half he comes at the top of the bucks\n\n\nHe crosses only for Boran Ahdusamad to clear\n\n\nOver to Haslim\n\n\nHaslim bringing the ball forward\n\n\nPlaying the fetch and carry role\n\n\nHe crosses the ball to the far side over to Wing Onn\n\n\nWing Onn is free\n\n\nHe's got one man to beat now\n\n\nHe beats the man crosses the ball yes and it's clear the way by\nZagariah Musah\n\n\nAnd he's clearing to touch for a touch in to Singapore\n\n\nWhat exciting moments here in the National Stadium as the fifty\nthousand fans rise and cheer\n\n\nAll these exciting moments\n\n\nThey're enjoying it but what they really want is a goal from the\nhome team\n\n\nAre they gonna get it\n\n\nAnd we don't have very much time left\n\n\nTrengganu I'm sure will be very very happy very pleased with\nthemselves if they can come away with a draw\n\n\nSingapore in the mean time putting

at the National Stadium scored by that guy again Myo\nHlaing Win\n\n\nMyanmar ahead in the SEA Games soccer final and really the\ninexperience of the eighteen year old goalkeeper Somcit Wacharapong was very\nevident there in the Thai goal\n\n\nIt's a big sin in goal keeping\n\n\nYou'll always have to make sure that your body is behind the ball\n\n\nAt time his body wasn't even around that and his reflexes were very\npoor\n\n\nThat's the way to do it says Aung Kyaw Kyaw as he gathered that\nshot from uh Attakpong quite easily and really that effort looked harmless\n\n\nVitton\n\n\nThis is turning out to be a magnificent final\n\n\nUnbelievable and you're just describing Myanmar's character and how\ninteresting it is if Thailand were to go a ball down since they haven't been\na goal down before in the tournament\n\n\nWell this is their <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nWell we were just talking about Vitoon being up front with Piyapong\nand Vitoon doesn't have the pace of a striker and doesn't have the\ntraditional sense of a striker but he's certainly showed the finishing\ntouches of a striker\n\n\nThen Piyapong just well\n\n\nHe's all fired up for the final\n\n\nYes <unclear>

</unclear> looking\nsuspect indeed and being with a cross so we have two goals in two minutes\n\n\nSo naing in the fifth for Myanamr and Vitoon in the seventh for\nThailand\n\n\nIt's one all a well-balanced final indeed\n\n\nI suppose exactly what happened in the bang against Malaysia and\nthey're going a goal up earlier on and then Malaysia scoring fairly quicker\n\n\nMyanmar have been very disciplined moving forward but not really at\nthe back\n\n\nThat was the eighth goal conceived from them\n\n\nKyi Lywin lovely play by Kyi Lywin again\n\n\nAnd he's taken off against uh Singapore and it seems that he was\ntaken off at half time probably to rest him for the final and that's how\nconfident the Myanmar players were\n\n\nHe was limping a bit but he wasn't really that bad when you\nconsider that Malek had pulled a hamstring in the semi-finals and was taken\noff immediately before the scoring of the two sides\n\n\nWell played by Moe Kyaw\n\n\nTawan Sripan\n\n\nThis is a wonderful run by him\n\n\nHe's beaten two men two men\n\n\nNine <unclear> word </unclear> up for Vitoon again and well we\napologise as the scorer of Thailand\n\n\nWell there was no need to actually\n\n\nIt's was just very badly struck from the number forty\n\n\nThailand goal will relate to that very well\n\n\nThailand have certainly started the game up much brighter and more\nconfident than Myanmar\n\n\nWell with the experience big big game well turning it on that\ncounts most\n\n\nThailand are certainly going it towards a gold medal in the SEA\nGames soccer final and it's that guy Piyapong Pueon who wins a header two\nheaders\n\n\nRemember in the final in nineteen eighty-three against Singapore\ngot Thailand on the way to a two one victory on the gold medal and this\nheader could prove to be very important as well in the eleventh minute\nThailand lead by two goals to one\n\n\nOnce again very poor defending by Myanmar\n\n\nHe's already stated that this could be his last SEA Games and they\nwant to bring the gold medal back desperately to Thailand\n\n\nThey haven't won it since nineteen eighty-five and they win\nSingapore two nil on home ground\n\n\nBut Myo Hlaing we all know about Myanmar's come back <unclear> word\n</unclear> how determined they are and they <unclear> word </unclear> back at\nyou\n\n\nGood work once again by Myo Hlaing\n\n\nThought that was a foul actually and they claim that it's a pass\nback by the defender Myo Hlaing\n\n\nThe goalkeeper didn't pick that one up\n\n\nSo a relief indeed to Somcit Wacharapong\n\n\nHis fifth minute error is giving Myanmar that kind of start\n\n\nThey wanted Myo Hlaing\n\n\nHe has been the live wire of the Myanmar team at the moment\n\n\nMyo Hlaing\n\n\nHe's the only one who wants the ball just attacking it\n\n\nThe rest they're just waiting for the ball to land at their feet\n\n\nKyaw Kyaw finding some room for that cross\n\n\nMyanmar remember the privilege two of the most exciting matches in\nthe SEA Games against Malaysia and of course the epic battle in the\nsemi-final against Singapore\n\n\nMyo Aung Tawan Sripan too much of the ball\n\n\nMyo Hlaing wins\n\n\nGood skill again by Myo Hlaing\n\n\nOh lovely ball played outside\n\n\nHere's Ye Htut\n\n\nCan he get the cross in\n\n\nNo and he doesn't even get the corner\n\n\nGood work by Surasak Tungsurat\n\n\nNice little leap by Piyahpong\n\n\nWell won in the air\n\n\nHere's Surasak Tungsurat\n\n\nThere Phathanapong not convincely\n\n\nSurachai as well\n\n\nHere's Apichad Thaveechalerndit\n\n\nHe started out as a right back in this tournament and he's moved\nforward to uh mid-field now\n\n\nAfter is he's <unclear> word </unclear> placed in the middle of\nthe path against Malaysia and Indonesia\n\n\nGood work by the seventeen year old Zaw oo and here's Kyi Lwin\n\n\nThat's more like it from Kyi Lwin the spreading play up\n\n\nMyo Hlaing taking over\n\n\nGood play\n\n\nHere's Kyi Lwin\n\n\nMyo Hlaing again\n\n\nGreat tackle second time around as well by Apichad\nThaveechalermdit and Myanmar could be in trouble here\n\n\nThe Thais are very quick\n\n\nThey're trying to break that time on the counter\n\n\nThey almost did\n\n\nThen Toe Aung who scored five goals in the tournament so far\n\n\nNice\n\n\nOh it was a typical Myanmar move\n\n\nMyanmar are very slick on the ground doing a lot of player\n\n\nSurachai Jaturappattarapong <unclear> word </unclear> beating\nalmost didn't work\n\n\nAnd it's gone out and we've got quarter of an hour gone by and a\nlot of action\n\n\nThree goals to talk about\n\n\nTwo to Thailand\n\n\nOne to Myanmar and now we even have uh substitution\n\n\nEarly one\n\n\nSaw Ba Myint has been taken off\n\n\nHe hasn't had a good time\n\n\nAt the back Saw Ba Myint the sweeper and uh they have changed it\nto Than win\n\n\nThis is really a gamble by the coach playing someone to the heart\nof defence who's only had one game prior to this game\n\n\nEasy cross to deal with\n\n\nHe wanted something spectacular the substitute Than win\n\n\nand after both sides after that <unclear> word </unclear> have\nsettle down a little Good ball once again by Kyi Lwin\n\n\nNice movement upfront by Myanmar\n\n\nIt's not being shown at the moment and perhaps that is where they\nare missing Wyin Aung now Wyn Aung does a lot of the after ball movement\n\n\nSurachai Surasak\n\n\nEasy for the defender there\n\n\nSoe Moe Kyaw\n\n\nAn unorthodox <unclear> word </unclear> he's playing for Noe Kyaw\nbecause he plays a left mid-field when they're attacking and left back on the\ndefender\n\n\nOffside Vitoon Kijmongkonsak <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nOffside clearly for that\n\n\nWell any three of the players in Thai team as starting to line up\nin today's final Played in the Merlion Cup Tournament way back in December\nand they send really they've re-teamed it\n\n\nFor there's a lot of depth in Thailand foot in Thai football\n\n\nHave they not got they own semi-professional leave back home\n\n\nWell the only weakness actually you can spot off Myanmar's Kyi\nLwin is that he doesn't get back and defend as uh as his good as his\nattacking players\n\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> Aung hung the body of Surasak <unclear>\nword </unclear>\n\n\nEven bury and his way\n\n\nYe Htut Kyi Lwin plays for Perak of course in the semi-pro league\n\n\nHere he is again\n\n\nOh\n\n\nNow that's probably summarises Myanmar's uh feel of the moment\ntowards this game\n\n\nA lack of cohesion at the back which is very evident\n\n\nAnd of course all control and in that time by Surachai\nJaturapattarapong\n\n\nHere's Myo Hlaing win who has been the best player so far\n\n\nA time well shut up by Surasak\n\n\nNobody offering support though for Surachai and he makes place for\nthe shot\n\n\nHe tried to curl it but nobody saw them\n\n\nThat was uh an old Thai error\n\n\nThey're not running it to place and no support up front\n\n\nThat was very evident in the semi-final the first half semi-final\nagainst Indonesia and also in the first half against Myanmar in the opening\nmatch and that time the same time we saw the old Myanmar error of not\nattacking the player on the ball\n\n\nApichad Thaveechalermdit\n\n\nNice little one to play with Vitoon exquisitely done there\n\n\nGreat skill by the number fourteen to bear it off and laid back\nfor Apichad who made some nice good running into the penalty box\n\n\nCertainly sample something from Myanmar there\n\n\nThe Thais and they could learnt how to defend against there as\nwell\n\n\nMyo Hlaing\n\n\nHe's been trying to prove too much at times\n\n\nMyo Hlaing win\n\n\nOh poor ball by Moe Kyaw Apichad who has been busy in mid-field\n\n\nNatee Tongsukkao\n\n\nWell that call it his solid defender at their tournament\n\n\nHere he is again\n\n\nHe's been cleared by Than win\n\n\nHalfway through this match and Thailand are leading by two goals\nto one\n\n\nAll the action coming in the first ten minutes\n\n\nPoor finish by Tawan Sriman and I don't ever remember him having a\nshot on target rather tournament Tawam Sriman\n\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> and certainly it's uh Myanmar throwing\nan unfamiliar sight there at the National Stadium and not passing the ball\naround and too <unclear> word </unclear> spread out very well and it's\ncontested again on this side\n\n\nThe Thais will like this\n\n\nThe Myanmar players really have to go in and attack them and stop\nthe game in mid-field \n\n\nThat's where the Thais are winning the battle at the moment\nDepartment separate the winner and the loser Apichad Thaveechalermdit Soe\nAung chasing it and Thais happy to just toss the ball around Defenders three\ngoals to one league They finally lose it What can Myanmar do now Moe Kyaw\nGood play by Soe Moe Kyaw Well it's a nice one here by Moe Kyaw A chance\nthough now for Than Toe Aung who's happy to settle for the corner strangely\nbecause

the first throw in of the game and their\nattack at Singapore defence straight away\n\n\nMichael Vana trying to latch onto the loose ball which was actually\na very poor pass laid on by Haslim Harun then and that's Abdullah Bohan back\nin Singapore colours\n\n\nYou wouldn't expect him to play at the start of the season\nespecially when Midel Scavachek opted for stoppers instead in of full back\nbut he's back\n\n\nThat's Noor Halis also in the starting line up tonight a quick ball\nforward and a nice header down there by Haslim to Kannan\n\n\nKannan got the better of uh Evans only for awhile and it's a goal\nkick to Sarawak\n\n\nK Kannan who hasn't scored in this Semi-Pro League yet\n\n\nI'm sure he'd would gladly love to open his <unclear> word\n</unclear> uh his accounts tonight and start a scoring spree for Singapore\n\n\nAnd the last time of course he's scored at the National Stadium was\nlast season but for a different team for Kuala Lumpur\n\n\nAnd that goal knocked Singapore out of the Malaysia Cup proper\n\n\nJohn Hunter climbing so very well for that one\n\n\nHe pits a real wallop in his shots\n\n\nJohn Hunter and he's out to prove he is what the papers have uh put\nhim out to be a proven goal scorer\n\n\nAuyong how would you uh what would you think of and what would you\ndo if you're faced with an opponent like John Hunter\n\n<$A> \n\nWell uhm uh looking at him he's big and hefty I would imagine\nthat uh Tong Hai should always uh get between uh him and his goal in order to\nhave uhm some uh head start especially when the ball is still behind Tong Hai\n\n\nBut I think uh Tong Hai being uh very young and uh energetic I\nthink he's uh he will do a good job from uh John Hunter this evening\n\n<$B> \n\nMichael Vana another one of the surging runs into the\nopposition penalty area\n\n\nDevaraj couldn't control the ball well enough\n\n\nHe was dropped for the game against Negri Sembilan but he is back\nto prove that he is first eleven material and he's scored in the first game\nagainst Trenggannu\n\n\nHe's trying to weave past his defenders again\n\n\nHe does well but the goal-keeper had no problems in catching the\nball Maslan won it\n\n\nHe's had no problem so far Maslan Wahid but he well looking at the\nthe way Sarawak played last season he's a little suspect when it comes to the\nhigh balls but then again when you uh cross the ball into the penalty area\nyou've got Jeff Current there to cut all the loose balls out for Sarawak\n\n\nHunter asking for the ball\n\n\nHe wants it placed right at his head but it's Vana who hits the\nball clear only as far as Jeff Current Razali Said\n\n\nAn aimless fall that time aiming just to clear it instead of uh\npassing it to a fellow team mate of his\n\n\nAnd this is Haslim Harun back in defence\n\n\nGood play here by Singapore\n\n\nPapanathan Vana\n\n\nSent tumbling down there by the Sarawak defender there\n\n\nRazali\n\n\nSingapore players knocking the ball around very confidently but of\ncourse the fans would love to see the boys knocking the ball that way in the\nopposition's half instead of their own half\n\n\nBut they're building slowly and steadily right into the half of the\norange shirted players Vana\n\n\nBack to Abdullah Bohan\n\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> left pull by Abdullah Bohan\n\n\nVery nice indeed to see him back again in the National

attempted goal and a very good\none as well and brought it down the ball down very well after a good lay out\nby K Kannan but that was a good save indeed by the goal-keeper\n\n\nThe shot didn't carry too much power but still Mazan Wahid got down\nto the ball well\n\n\nGood shot by Vana as you were saying Auyong\n\n<$A> \n\nRight\n\n\nI I would imagine that uh Singapore is doing uh they're very\ncautious at the moment\n\n\nThey're playing the ball uh to the feet and uh they're attempting\nto penetrate the middle\n\n\nBut I would imagine that uh having a tall defenders like Dave Evans\nand uh uh in the middle they should uh try and use more of the flanks to uh\nsend the ball in uh for our meaty uh forward uh Kannan and Devaraj\n\n<$B> \n\nVana again Vanar on the move\n\n\nGood play by Michael Vana what a start again and he's just won't\nstop scoring would he\n\n\nThe fans just love him right here and five minutes gone by\nSingapore are already leading by one goal to nil and that would go down at\none of the greatest Malaysia Cup goals ever scored by a Singapore player\n\n\nHe got the ball from Haslim and he cut in from almost thirty metres\nout\n\n\nHe let three defenders in his wake and just slotted the ball into\nthe nets to give Singapore the start at their grand top and that kind of\nstart that coach P M Sivagy had ask for\n\n\nWhat do you see of the goal Auyong\n\n<$A> \n\nThat was a brilliant by uh Vana indeed\n\n\nHe uh he took the ball and uh he managed to uh weave his way pass a\ncouple of defenders in the middle before the slotting the ball in\n\n\nI think that was a classic piece of uh move by Vana\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd look at that wonderful shooting wonderful control of the\nball and so cool when it comes through the final touch\n\n\nIt is fifth goal of the competition and he's way ahead at the\ntop-scorer\n\n\nThe goal top goal getter of the year award\n\n\nKannan with a nice back heel to Malek Kawoff\n\n\nMalek standing up to his opposition very well but Jeff Current is\nlittle too tall for Devaraj\n\n\nI don't think Devaraj can actually saw that ball perfect into the\npenalty box at all\n\n<$A> \n\nLet's see the goal from this lovely angle\n\n\nAuyong\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nWell uh it's a a really uh brilliantly struck uh left footer into\nthe uh left bottom corner of the net\n\n\nUh well credit must certainly be given to uh uh Vana\n\n\nHe did really well there\n\n<$A> \n\nOh in case you just saw the instant replay from the back of\nthe nets\n\n\nLet me tell you that it was Vana who scored the goal\n\n\nYou couldn't really see him scoring it but it was him who started\ngoal passed Maslan Wahid\n\n\nIt's still there by Effendi Julaihim and here's Vana again\n\n\nLook at him go\n\n\nA ball cut inside well served to Kannan\n\n\nAnd here's Vana faced with the Australian defender\n\n\nGood skill by Devaraj\n\n\nGood turn now to Haslim and Jeff Current doing all he can\n\n\nA little bit messy it might be but he did all he can to prevent\nHaslim and Kannan to <unclear> word </unclear> doing up something for\nSingapore again\n\n\nAnd the boys are really swarming and launching weight after weight\nat the Sarawak defence aren't they\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n\nThey suddenly uh are doing that and uh if they mount and continued\nto uh treasure the the Sawarakian defence I'm sure we'll see a second goal\nvery soon\n\n\nUh Mark\n\n<$A> \n\nThe fans down here certainly hope they do\n\n\nVana\n\n\nA lovely pull back then\n\n\nA good <unclear> word </unclear> inside but well cleared by David\nEvans\n\n\nGood ball by Noor Halis Shafik\n\n\nOne advantage of having Noor Halis Shafik to the back liners that\nhe provides all the uh ground skills whereas the other two Tong Hai and\nPapanathan provide the aerial skills\n\n<$B> \n\nUh yes indeed uh Shafik has always been a very uh tough player\n\n<$A> \n\nOh so close Razali Said who threatened to score a few goals\nfrom outside the box against Trengganu\n\n\nAlmost got the shot on target and gave Singapore a two goal cushion\nin the first ten minutes of the match\n\n<$B> \n\nYa yes indeed\n\n\nRazali Said indeed packs a a real wallop in both his feet and uh it\nwill certainly be a pleasure if you could see another of his uh replays uh in\nthe previous games\n\n<$A> \n\nJohn Hunter\n\n\nVery difficult to shake him off the ball indeed all hundred\nkilograms of the big man the big Sarawakian\n\n\nIn fact he's an Australian playing in Sarawak\n\n\nPama cut that one out easily not convincingly but good enough to\nprevent that Sarawak way from turning <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nHere is Razali Said\n\n\nHe's given the role of orchestrating the move from mid-field\ntonight and he's certainly did very then on that part on that time that\noccasion\n\n\nBut Malek Kawak was not allowed to pump a good cross into the\nSarawak penalty box although it was illegal\n\n\nA bad tackle then by Mohammud Dalan\n\n\nAnd a free kick for Singapore in a very dangerous position\n\n\nRazali Said behind the ball\n\n\nMichael Vana It's the head that he'll be looking for\n\n\nMazlan Wahid\n\n\nHe's not very confident\n\n\nWell with Vana scoring a goal in the fifth minute of play earlier\nand we don't expect Mazlan to be most confident person in the world at the\nmoment\n\n\nIt's a stadium packed to the fullest\n\n\nAt least fifty thousand people here tonight and they've had a a\nlot to cheer about after only ten minutes of play gone by\n\n\nBut I'm sure they will want more from the Singapore team\n\n\nSarawak trying to regain their composure which they showed in the\nearly stages of the match\n\n\nI'm sure it was definitely shattered\n\n\nThat was Michael Vana\n\n\nHe's reading his way round the defence so easily and putting the\nball at the back of the Sarawak net only five minutes of play gone by\n\n\nHaslim who had just taken position of the ball\n\n\nAbdullah Bohan\n\n\nHere is Malek\n\n\nSingapore boys practising patience in their build up\n\n\nDevaraj and a chase for the ball with uh David Evans and uh\nDevaraj did enough to shake David Evans off the ball to win a throw in for\nSingapore\n\n\nVana he's got two players polis policing him but he gets the ball\nin time to Kannan and Devaraj didn't lift the ball high enough to get the\nball pass Evan's head\n\n\nNoor Halis\n\n\nNoor Halis Shafik\n\n\nGood play by Noor Halis\n\n\nHe's got support from Vana and he uses it\n\n\nVana down to Devaraj then to Kannan\n\n\nHe saw some sheer tugging then by Dave Evans which the referee\nalso saw and they didn't escape the referee's eyes then\n\n\nSo it's a free kick at the edge of the Sarawak box\n\n\nWe've got about uhm just about twenty metres outside the penalty\nbox and we've seen Vana striking\n\n\nHe's struck a very good shot against Trenggannu which just sailed\nover the bar and I'm sure he might want to do better in a situation like this\nnow\n\n\nKannan is also behind the ball but Kannan heads it straight at the\nball\n\n\nVana with the second bite of the apple\n\n\nAnd all the way back for Singapore to do some defending\n\n\nTong Hai lost a little ball control then\n\n\nTong Hai a little bit off his balance but then of course it's much\nbetter for him to clear the ball into the Sarawak half and leave it to the\nSarawak players uh to build up from their very own half than to clear it in\nhis own half and uh put Singapore under some pressure\n\n\nHunter\n\n\nOh that's some confidence morale boosting effect on uh Lim Tong\nHai ahead of one against John Hunter\n\n\nMalek T Papanathan Haslim\n\n\nHe's got some space here to try\n\n\nHe which he does but his shots just uh wasn't suited for a goal\ncalibre and I'm sure that Haslim he himself would have hoped for a better\nshot \n\n\nAuyong how have you see the match gone by thirty minutes of play\ngone by and uh how how is the match gone

themselves\n\n\nHaslim\n\n\nA good shot by Haslim and it just sailed over the bar and that\nbelieve it or not is uh Singapore's first attempted goal\n\n<$B> \n\nFirst good attempt\n\n\nHaslim had run earlier\n\n\nHe shot wide and very feebly\n\n\nThe only encouraging sign like I said is Singapore are putting a lot\nof pressure on the Kuala Lumpur players\n\n\nThey look dangerous\n\n\nOnly from a couple of long shots and the goal came about as a\nresult of Pathanathan's mistake when he actually played the ball into the\npath\n\n\nAnton Bravo allowing him to run at the Singapore defence\n\n<$A> \n\nOnce again some good play by Kuala Lumpur and this is the\ndefender coming up to join the attack\n\n\nSo Kuala Lumpur is still hanging on to that one goal lead against\nSingapore scored in the nineteenth minute from Azman Adnan\n\n\nAnd the big question that was raised before this match\n\n\nWill Singapore miss Michael Varna\n\n\nWell at the moment I have to say yes because there's no forward no\nmid-fielder who's runnning at the Kuala Lumpur defenders at the moment\n\n\nGood cross by Abdullah Bohan on the run but a good catch by V\nMuruggan who seems to be very confident coming out of his box collecting\nthese crosses\n\n<$B> \n\nHe is a good goalie\n\n\nHe had his critics say a couple of seasons ago but ever since then\nhe's just grown from strength to strength\n\n<$A> \n\nNazri Latiff Abdullah\n\n\nWe haven't seen much of Latiff and his uh hard runs and we see him\nlosing the ball again\n\n\nSingapore defenders a little bit slow to shoot this down\n\n\nOh good tackle\n\n\nFantastic last minute saving tackle by Noor Haliz Shafik and Abdul\nMalek must be panicking at the moment\n\n<$B> \n\nHe must be wondering where his defence is\n\n<$A> \n\nAzman Adnan once again almost profiting from a defensive lapse\nby a Singapore player\n\n\nThat time Latiff Abdullah who's come up to the near post to do his\ndefensive duties now\n\n\nFive goals so far one in the F A M Cup\n\n\nAzman Abdullah\n\n\nCertainly a striker for the future for Kuala Lumpur and Malaysia of\ncourse\n\n\nNoor Haliz once again doing some appearing for Singapore and the\npressure from K Kannan the miss kick by Chai Siew Yai and it's a throw to for\nSingapore\n\n\nHaslim Nazri\n\n\nGood ball by Nazri Nazir\n\n\nOh <unclear> word </unclear> just misjudged that ball\n\n\nThe ground is a little bit slip slippery I must state after a\ndownpour in the early part of the afternoon and the late stage late part of\nthe aft morning right here at the National Stadium\n\n\nAnd so the pitch is a little bit slippery and soggy tonight and\nthat could only encourage uh Singapore team to take shot at goal which uh\nsadly they're not doing at the moment\n\n\nAbdullah Bohan Latiff\n\n\nAbdullah back to uh Malek\n\n\nReturn by Malek Kawak\n\n\nAnd Malek even finding it hard to control the ball on the track let\nalone on the grass\n\n\nIt's all going wrong for the Singapore team at the moment\n\n\nGood play by Nazri Nazir\n\n\nClaimed that he was held back\n\n\nBut the referee thought otherwise and has given a throw in to Kuala\nLumpur\n\n\nNazri has uh had a good few good games for Singapore\n\n\nLatiff Abdullah using his chest to put effects there but not a very\ngood ball by Malek Kawak almost putting uh Nazri Nazir into a very dangerous\nsituation where the Kuala Lumpur defender See Kim Savan\n\n\nAmin Nasir Anton Bravo climbing and beating Malek Kawak easily\n\n\nKannan\n\n\nGood play by K Kannan and definitely a foul\n\n\nZoran Nicholich the culprit then\n\n\nBut that's good close control by K Kannan and some encouraging\nsigns for the Singapore team\n\n\nWe've had twenty-seven minutes gone by\n\n\nWe had a goal and it's come from the tigers in red of Kuala Lumpur\n\n\nAzman Adnan the hero at the moment\n\n\nMalek chasing very hard for this one\n\n\nOh that's cool defending\n\n\nFantastic defender by Chai Siew Yeow\n\n\nWonderful play and uh Anton Bravo was misreading that for a little\nwhile allowing it to go out ball\n\n\nA throw in to Singapore\n\n\nNot as many people coming here to watch tonight's match and at the\nmoment the rate the Singapore boys are going there might be even less in the\nnext match\n\n\nLatiff Abdullah\n\n\nOh failing to control that and the Singapore team not only finding\nit hard to string their passes together but they're also finding it difficult\nto control the ball on this very slippery pitch\n\n\nAnton Bravo\n\n\nNow that's good ball control\n\n\nSharom Abdul Majid coming in from the blind side almost catching\nPapanathan and he was very confident that his custodian would get to the ball\nwhich he did and here is Noor Haliz Shafik\n\n\nNazri coming down deep to collect and fetch and carry\n\n\nAbdullah Mohan\n\n\nGood header to Haslim\n\n\nFaced with uh Rajid Ismail\n\n\nGood ball inside for Malek\n\n\nA lovely ball for Kannan\n\n\nWill interception go\n\n\nDanger's not over yet for Kuala Lumpur\n\n\nHere's comes K Kunalan faced with K Kunalan\n\n\nOh good play by Kannan\n\n\nGot past Kunalan so very easily but Kunalan did enough to push him\naway for the ball\n\n\nLatiff not the biggest of players but got got up so well for that\none\n\n\nHere is Nazri\n\n\nNazri trying to do a little too much\n\n\nAbdullah Mohan\n\n\nCan he keep it in play\n\n\nYes he can\n\n\nNow what kind of cross is he gonna give\n\n\nA good one going past every player except to Malek Kawak\n\n\nSingapore boys enjoying some pressure until that poor ball\n\n\nIn fact poor play Malek Kawak allowing Zoran Nicholich to to free\n\n\nAzman Adnan\n\n\nDanger for Singapore once again\n\n\nAzman interest wide\n\n\nIn fact I think Abdul Malik got a good fingertip at the ball to\ndivert it out for a corner to Kuala Lumpur\n\n\nIt could have been two nil so very easily and once again from the\nmistake by a Singapore mid-fielder\n\n\nA lapse of concentration this time in the Kuala Lumpur half and it\njust takes one pass from Zuran Nicholich to uh give the strikers some rule to\nrun at the Singapore defenders\n\n<$B> \n\nThat's the mark of the great player\n\n\nHe saw what Malek was going to do\n\n\nRobbed him and set up the attack\n\n<$A> \n\nPapanathan cleared the danger for a little while\n\n\nBut it's not over yet\n\n\nNicholich Grabo\n\n\nThe two co-eds linking up together and uh Latiff bounced off the\ntree top\n\n\nLatiff Abdullah although he would claim that he played a one two\nthen\n\n\nBall back to Papanathan\n\n\nThen to Kannan easing up some pressure now from the Singapore side\n\n\nDevaraj\n\n\nGood control by Deveraj\n\n\nThen to Nazri\n\n\nNazri with a good ball out to Abdullah Bohan\n\n\nAbdullah has got a defender to beat and Abdullah is uh showing\nsome poor ball control on this right flank\n\n\nBertrand\n\n<$B> \n\nThat his is problem actually\n\n\nHe is a very tough hard uncompromising player but his control does\nleave a little bit more to be desired at this level\n\n\nShariff Mohammud out jumped by Noor Halis\n\n\nAnton down with an injury at the moment\n\n\nBeen half an hour gone by\n\n\nIn fact my watch says thirty-two minutes gone by\n\n\nSingapore haven't had a serious attempt at the Kuala Lumpur goal\nyet and B Muruggan has had a a very a field day except for some crossing to\nthe penalty box which he gathered quite well\n\n\nHe's had an easy time with the Singapore strikes <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n\nGood ball Haslim Harun\n\n\nAnd that's the danger posed by Latiff Abdullah\n\n\nHe's seem small\n\n\nYou cannot see him and you know when he comes from deep he just\nbeats the defenders and sometimes you can't he sneaks in from behind and uh\nhe sneaks in from behind and actually just uh grabs the ball from you when\nyou're attacking with without even knowing it\n\n\nThere he is Latiff Abdullah showing us that uh the throw ins are\ndefinitely one of his fortes not one of his fortes\n\n\nDoing a close marking job on Zorun Nicholich now\n\n\nGets away from Heiwich with some ease that Latiff worked so hard\nto get it back\n\n\nA good true ball splitting the Singapore defence once again\n\n\nSharin\n\n\nOh a misunderstanding then which could have proved uh fatal to the\nSingapore team\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd Singapore were lucky there\n\n\nThe ball couldn't settle again\n\n\nRun kindly for Sharin Abdullah\n\n<$A> \n\nSo Latiff Abdullah in fact uh in fact uhm P N C Bargy have\ndecided to play a zonal marking system in mid-field to shut out uh Zoran\nNicholich but it hasn't worked so far\n\n\nI think he's got to send a man on him\n\n\nLatiff getting pass Anton Bravo with some luck but it cannot\ncontinue forever and uh that pass of his went astray and C Bargy\n\n\nWell a half-time talk and uh one replacement really sparked off a\nmuch better display in the second half from the Singapore charges against\nJohore the earlier match\n\n\nIt's preceding match but is he gonna be faced with a situation\nlike this again\n\n\nHe's not very happy at the moment Sanjay Ravi\n\n\nI'm sure he'll be saying in his head that he would have stopped\nthat goal but he cannot fault Malek on his uh display tonight\n\n\nAbdul Malek has been playing very very well for Singapore\n\n<$B> \n\nI bet he's the one who's keeping us in this game\n\n\nHe's had a couple of fingertip saves and by the post and he's tip\nto over the ball\n\n\nK L could easily be two or three up by now but for uhm Abdul Malek\n\n<$A> \n\nThe Singapore mid-fielders are diminishing in this match at\nthe moment\n\n\nThey're almost disappearing\n\n\nYou cannot even see them controlling the ball in the middle of the\npath\n\n\nOutside Zaid Chamail or rather Rajid Ismail failed to keep the\nball in play\n\n\nGood ball by Nazri to Haslim that Zuran fought so hard and got\nback in time to shut out the danger pose by Singapore then\n\n\nAnd as I was saying that certainly justified my claim that the\nSingapore boys are not knocking with the ball around and they're finding it\nmore difficult to control the ball in this wet pitch than the Kuala Lumpur\nteam are\n\n<$B> \n\nThe Kuala Lumpur team is playing it a lot more smarter by\nplaying either to the feet or if there's a wide open space\n\n\nThey're play into the space for the ball to run onto\n\n\nThe Singapore boys aren't doing that at the moment\n\n<$A> \n\nNazri and the Singapore team\n\n\nThe players are actually having trouble with throw in as well\n\n\nKuala Lumpur have always done well right here at the National\nStadium\n\n\nThe only defeat uh so far in five years has been in nineteen\nninety when they lost to a quack Singapore squad which included Alistar\nEdwards and Abbas Said then\n\n\nThey lost last year and uh uh they actually won last year\n\n\nI beg your pardon\n\n\nThey won last year\n\n\nThey beat Singapore two one and this year at the moment they're\nleading one nil\n\n\nMalek\n\n\nThe fans urging the Singapore boys on the offensive\n\n\nDevaraj to Latiff\n\n\nEasy for M Murugan stopping the ball from going out for a corner\nkick\n\n\nThe roar of uh thirty-six minutes gone by in this first half\n\n\nThe Singapore team have had nothing to show for and in fact it's\nKuala Lumpur who are orchestrating the better moves at the moment scoring a\ngoal as well as you can see from Azman Adnan in the nineteenth minute of play\n\n\nAmin Nasir faced with Anton Bravo\n\n\nWell I'm sure foul Amin then\n\n\nA little bit of short tugging which the linesmen saw\n\n\nGood observation by the linesmen\n\n\nHaslim\n\n\nWe haven't seen much of Haslim and uh the form that he showed in\nPerak\n\n\nWell that's a good ball by Haslim Harun Nazri", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

everybody\n\n\nRafi Ali\n\n\nA brilliant solo run there by Rafi and he just shocked us by\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nCould have been a striking goal tonight\n\n\nThe Sabah defender just stood there and allowed Rafi to run up\nthere and while he did so well to bring in the ball all the way to the\npenalty box before losing it\n\n\nThat came in the third minute of play almost an early lead for\nSingapore\n\n\nOh with me tonight is Garetth Nicolee and uh Garetth your views on\ntonight's game and Singapore's recent slump\n\n\nAbdul Malek\n\n\nHis first touch of the ball and his counterpart in the Sabah goal\n\n\nNatalika hasn't had one yet\n\n\nBut the Singapore boys are dominating the early proceedings in the\nNational Stadium\n\n\nGood ball once again by Malek\n\n\nNazri Kannan measured that one perfectly and a beautiful pass as\nwell to Rafi\n\n\nAnd he almost repeated his performance last week in Sabah where he\ngot his first goal for the National team\n\n\nGood cross by K Kannan\n\n\nJust a <unclear> word </unclear> from header from this guy Rafi Ali\n\n\nAnd going by the early proceedings here it's all systems go from\nthis man\n\n\nHe's instructed his boys to go all the way out for victory tonight\n\n\nAnd that's what they're doing at the moment\n\n\nThe Singapore players certainly piling on the pressure\n\n\nGood jump by Abdul Bohan\n\n\nHe won that one perfectly well\n\n\nDevaraj\n\n\nPoor first touch almost let him down but he's still in possession\nof the ball\n\n\nHe gets it back just as quickly as he lost it\n\n\nDown to Nazri\n\n\nGood ball by V Devaraj and it took a good tackling job there by uh\nnumber eighteen Charles Tindy to deny Nazri Nasir a closer look at the byline\nand an easier cross into the penalty box\n\n\nSo the first corner of the match going to Singapore with only five\nminutes of play gone by\n\n\nGarusla Nicolich or Natolika\n\n\nThat's right Natolika\n\n\nHe's got some work to do now\n\n\nA short one\n\n\nA good one too between Devaraj and Nazri\n\n\nThe cross not very good\n\n\nIt's definitely Yaruslav's ball decides to give it up pump up front\n\n\nDevaraj offside\n\n\nVikay S Nair from Johore\n\n\nA familiar face right here at the National Stadium\n\n\nHe's officiated so many matches and uh it's Abdullah Bohan\n\n\nProbably an early casualty here\n\n\nThese early moments of the match can prove to be so very crucial as\nthe last few home matches have shown\n\n\nSingapore have conceded the early goal\n\n\nThey've gone on to concede another one and uh a little later on\ngone on to lose their last two home matches as well against Johore and Kuala\nLumpur respectively\n\n\nSabah on the attack now\n\n\nA look at goal for Abdullah Ardi but he was too hasty in taking the\nshot and it goes out for a goal kick to Singapore\n\n\nGood header only as far as Papanathan though and here come the\nSingapore team\n\n\nObstruction on the path of Abdullah Bohan\n\n\nThat's Rozali Zilin the skipper in the Sabah team tonight\n\n\nHe's a very hardworking mid-fielder\n\n\nIn fact it's from him that all the passes come from for their goals\nthis season so far\n\n\nAnd mind you Sabah have been uh having a good streak in the league\n\n\nThey've had four victories and they're somewhere in mid-table\n\n\nPlanning to add to the victories again tonight at the National\nStadium\n\n\nThey have a chance here\n\n\nNorhalis Shafik he had nowhere to go\n\n\nVitaslav once again closely marked by Amin Nazsir\n\n\nPoor ball control there\n\n\nIt's uh Charles Tindy\n\n\nThrow in quickly taken by Nazri Nasir\n\n\nA different atmosphere and a different ground surely from the one\nthey played last week in uh Kota Kinabalu\n\n\nKannan\n\n\nOh look quick play by K Kannan\n\n\nWonderful stop here by Kannan Gochiramun\n\n\nOh he decided to be a little bit too unselfish there\n\n\nHe should have taken a putt shot at goal\n\n\nK Kannan but he decided to give it a cross and it's offside on the\npath of D Devaraj\n\n\nNine minutes of play gone by\n\n\nSingapore dominating but once again leaving their scoring boots at\nleaving at the early stages of this match so far\n\n\nThey're playing with some intensity at least and some vigour\n\n\nThat's what the fans have come here to see\n\n\nAbdullah Bohan getting to the ball before his opponents but he uh\nhe has fails to keep it in play pushing it out for a throw in for Sabah\n\n\nAnd we can see the Sabah players creeping in slowly but surely into\nthe game now\n\n\nThat's where the danger lies because the Singapore players are\nallowing the Sabah players too many too much time to settle on the ball\n\n\nGood ball once again by K Kannan\n\n\nWell shut out that time\n\n\nMatu Simbowi\n\n\nAbdullah Ardi Henry\n\n\nAnjun Abdullah Ardi\n\n\nThis is good football by Sabah well broken up to by Nazri Nasir\n\n\nHe put his foot in at the right time\n\n\nOnce again the strikers from not getting their services and uh\nthat's what we've been witnessing in our last two matches\n\n\nThe strikers not getting the services from their mid-fielders\n\n\nIt is not allowed to be freed around the uh touch line there\n\n\nAbdullah Boran who uh hastily came back and had to kick the ball\nout for a throw in to Sabah\n\n\nThey're getting nearer and nearer and uh everybody in the league\nthis season knows that the Singapore defence have been suspect all season\nround\n\n\nA lot of teams have been finding loopholes again and again\n\n\nCan Sabah find another one\n\n\nGood job by Amin Nasir\n\n\nGood ball up by Nazri to Rafi\n\n\nGood header down\n\n\nWell head well kicked out though by Matu Simbowi\n\n\nOnce again Matu Sim to the ball before Devaraj\n\n\nMalek\n\n\nSuperb header by Malek Kawak\n\n\nYou wouldn't expect him to win that one but he was way up before\nhis opponent\n\n\nMatu Simbowi\n\n\nLooking once again for Vitaslav upfront\n\n\nBut he was denied the ball\n\n\nSo it's still goaless between Singapore and Sabah\n\n\nTwelve minutes of play gone by\n\n\nSingapore have had one good effort at goal where Rafi Ali just\nmissed time his header after a good cross from uh K Kannan\n\n\nIn fact from the early proceedings we see that K Kannan is\ncertainly suited for this attacking mid-fielder's role\n\n\nOh a slip up there\n\n\nEarly morning rain at the National Stadium doing some uh a little\nbit hazardous on the player's part then\n\n\nMatu Sim\n\n\nThis is Yanu Midle Midleslav\n\n\nThey've retained him from last season Yanu\n\n\nIn fact they've retained almost all of last season's foreigners\nexcept for Michael Vana who has come over to Singapore\n\n\nMutu Sim once again the build up very sure very steady very easy\nfrom the back\n\n\nThey get a free kick from a very dangerous position now\n\n\nNorhalis Shafik the offender\n\n\nAnd Sabah have a chance now to take the early lead\n\n\nYuroslav Midleslav and Razali Zilin behind this ball and it looks\nlike it's Midleslav to take it\n\n\nNo it's Vitaslav who steps up\n\n\nOh he cracks the crossbar and Sabah had scored\n\n\nSo as the old <unclear> word </unclear> goes soccer is no use\nwithout their goals and Sabah have prove it again\n\n\nBobby Chua has repeated his one goal performance in Kota Kinabalu\nby being the first to latch onto that rebounds of the cross bar after a\nbrilliant free kick Tuma Vitaslav and after dominating for long periods in\nthe opening thirteen minutes Singapore have conceded another goal at the\nNational Stadium this time to Bobby Chua\n\n\nThere he is lerking and pouncing\n\n\nIt must certainly be depressing for the Singapore players but\nthat's the way it goes\n\n\nWe need the goals not the domination to win matches\n\n\nOnce again the Sabah defence is so very well marshalled tonight by\nYanu Midleslav\n\n\nHe's taking the free kick now\n\n\nHe's doing a very good job in uh controlling his players and\nthey've caught Singapore offside for the fourth time already in the opening\nstages\n\n\nVitaslav almost setting it up for Henry Anjun\n\n\nAnd uh it's from this guy Norhalis Shafik where the first goal\ncame from of course gave away the free kick\n\n\nNazri Kannan back to Nazri\n\n\nGood ball inside by Nazri Nasir\n\n\nAbdullah Bohan\n\n\nHaslim\n\n\nA chance for Singapore to draw level\n\n\nHaslim Harun\n\n\nThe opportunity was there but Haslim took it a little bit too\nquickly and the ball just went higher and higher over the crossbar\n\n\nAmin Rafi\n\n\nGood play by Rafi Ali\n\n\nAbdullah Bohan\n\n\nOh doing very well in a very unfamiliar role up front\n\n\nThis is good play by Singapore but in the end the players got into\neach other's way\n\n\nWell done Norhalis Shafik\n\n\nCould he make up for that mistake\n\n\nIt's a good cross good jump though by Yanu Midleslav\n\n\nMalek Kawak\n\n\nSuperb play but not a very good cross to match it\n\n\nRafi almost\n\n\nDid it look like an inch perfect cross\n\n\nGood effort under such circumstances\n\n\nSo he's settling down very nicely this uh twenty year old Rafi Ali\nand it's uh very nice to see uh two players from the Goh Chok Tong\ndevelopment scheme Nazri and uh Rafi\n\n\nThey've graduated from that scheme playing along each other\ntonight\n\n\nThe fans still very hopeful that Singapore would back from this\none goal deficit\n\n\nAnd remember the carrot dangling in front of them now is a\nthousand dollars per goal if they win\n\n\nThat came from a manufacturing company\n\n\nOh poor defending once again by the Singapore team\n\n\nBut Papanathan coming all the way back to do a good defensive job\nthen and a very poor ball up front there\n\n\nBut K Kannan he should have released it much much earlier\n\n\nRazali Zilin\n\n\nAmin\n\n\nGood play by Amin Nasir\n\n\nMalek to Nazri\n\n\nWell done\n\n\nK Kannan to Nazri\n\n\nAlmost getting round this player but still fail\n\n\nOh good play by Nazri Nasir\n\n\nWork so hard to get the ball back and Charles Tindy had no choice\nbut to put it up for a throw in to Singapore\n\n\nDevaraj closely policed by Matu Simbowi Good turn though by\nDevaraj\n\n\nA little bit late on the cross but it was Nazri who finally\ncrossed it and uh and a strange decision then by the goalkeeper Yarusla\n\n\nHe came all the way out for it\n\n\nIt's certainly wasn't his ball\n\n\nKannan with a corner\n\n\nThe fans urging the Singapore players on\n\n\nGood play\n\n\nThis is Haslim\n\n\nOh chips back again by Abdullah Bohan but nobody was there except\nfor Gerard Pogileo who headed the ball out\n\n\nGood one though by Haslim Harun and we saw flashes of his uh\nnineteen ninety season brilliance should I say we haven't seen much of it\n\n\nHe's had two goals to his credit though this season so far\n\n\nThe ball inside to Rafi\n\n\nKannan\n\n\nOnce again he just didn't want to shoot\n\n\nAnd now here comes a counterattack where the danger lies\n\n\nDefinitely a foul on Bobby Chua\n\n\nPapanathan\n\n\nNow once again let us remind you that the uh Sabah offensive force\nis a very very fast lot\n\n\nAnd it's so very crucial to counter their speed Yanu Midloslav\n\n\nThey're definitely looking for the head of uh Witaslav now\n\n\nBut it's Abdul Malek's ball\n\n\nHe comes up playing this very well\n\n\nSo hard to counterattack very quickly as well\n\n\nV Devaraj\n\n\nGood play by Devaraj to Haslim\n\n\nGood ball control\n\n\nOh lost out\n\n\nWonderful covering by Yanu Midloslav though\n\n\nHe came back all the way from his uh position\n\n\nBut he took the free kick to cover that\n\n\nMalek\n\n\nSuperb play by Malek Kawak\n\n\nDown to Abdullah Bohan\n\n\nDoing some very hard running Abdullah Bohan and uh causing he's\ncalled in a few problems\n\n\nOn the other side of the field the Sabah defensive third Devaraj\nto Abdullah \n\n\nDeciding to take his defender on Defender running defender and we\nhave an offender the form of uh Sabah's Checkason <unclear> word </unclear>\nKilan The Sabah team

propelling them to third place in the lead\nagainst the free kick goal by K L discard Lim Tiong Kim\n\n\nAnd the fact that Negri Sembilan has been doing so well is mainly\ndue to the fact that they're the almost unbeatable all season in their home\nsquat at the Parayi Stadium\n\n\nGood play by Nazri\n\n\nHe misses the ball finally to Malek Kawak and to Haslim\n\n\nGood touches by Haslim\n\n\nA good

turning getting in a very good cross\n\n\nTheir first touch there and let Rafee down\n\n\nThat's our problem with our strikers though mark there\n\n\nThey're a bit on the small side and with people like uh Miloslav\nlurking in the background he's uh he's European and he's a lot bigger than\nour players\n\n\nThey're not going to win too many in the air\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's very bright start though

punished Singapore\n\n\nMalek had no chance with that one\n\n<$A> \n\nTocky John\n\n\nA foul there\n\n\nIn fact uh manager Patrick Ang I was speaking to him earlier on\nand he told that he told

the cross out for Manso\nSulaiman\n\n\nOur Singapore defence Betrand has really been suspect all season\nnow haven't they\n\n<$B> \n\nYes they have\n\n\nThey've let in I believe that their eighteen

excuse in giving Tiong Kim that much space and\ntime to actually to place a shot in the net\n\n\nA corner by Robert Bozik\n\n\nThe referee it didn't escape the referee's eye\n\n\nThen S Silverajan of Selangor saw that\n\n\nThe punch onto the abdomen of uh in fact it's the stomach of uhm\nAmin Nasir Norhalis\n\n\nHe really mistimed his jump against Lim Tiong Kim to Nazri\n\n\nHe's been one of the brighter players in the Singapore team so far\n\n\nKannan to Tocky John\n\n\nBacking very hard for this one\n\n\nSome scrappy play here\n\n\nKannan takes a shot at goal easily blocked by Miroslavagogig who's\nso cooly disposes of the ball\n\n\nK Kannan almost getting his name to the score sheet there\n\n\nMalek Haslim\n\n\nThat's being a little too clever\n\n\nIt should be Abdul Malek's ball and old Papanathan comes claims it\n\n\nNow there's some player challenging by the Negri Sembilan defender\n\n\nOur crowd certainly not uh savouring these opening minutes at the\nNational Stadium in seeing the Singapore defence concede another goal\n\n\nA foul by Abdullah Bohan\n\n\nK Kannan is down after that very heavy tackle on him by Miloslav\nBoggig\n\n\nAnd uh that ball has certainly depressed a few of the Singapore\nboys\n\n\nBertrand\n\n<$B> \n\nYou're right Mark\n\n\nThey look as though they've lost their uhm sense of purpose\n\n\nThey started out very well making crisp passes moving well and all\nof a sudden they gave away a silly goal which has been the theme of their\nplay this season and they've lost the the uh the the urgency in their play\n\n<$A> \n\nYou might see an early entrance of V Sindrum Moorthy\n\n\nThere's uh K Kannan is down with an injury\n\n\nWe don't know how serious it is but it's Miloslav and a free kick\nfor Negri Sembilan\n\n\nVery dangerous but well cleared\n\n\nTiong Kim settling for the throw <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nHisham Bahrudin to Tiong Kim\n\n\nGetting a free foot\n\n\nIn a very very dangerous position indeed\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd once again Norhalis was the culprit\n\n\nHe's not having a good start to this game\n\n\nHe's been a bit rash in a couple of his challenges\n\n\nHe's fortunate\n\n\nThis free kick is out to the left although there is danger\n\n\nIt it's not as having one around the uhm the arc at the edge of\npenalty box\n\n\nWe really don't want to give one away there\n\n<$A> \n\nRobert

field of play\nto Pathma\n\n\nTocky John\n\n\nA good kick on by Tocky John and Kannan trying to look for Tocky\nJohn one once again\n\n\nAnd that's a little rash on the part of Abdullah Bohan there\n\n\nCame in a little bit too quickly and too unfairly\n\n\nRobert Bozic\n\n\nHe's operating on the left tonight\n\n\nKannan\n\n\nGood ball by Kannan\n\n\nTocky John has got some pace but can he reach with this\n\n\nNo he can't\n\n\nAbout twenty-two minutes of play gone by\n\n\nSingapore trailing by a goal to nil and this is the Negri coach\nYursaf Perell and uh Yursaf will certainly be more

looks\nlikely that he was going to go pass that height\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nSo the twenty-two year old Filipino will have to try again at\none point eight three metres\n\n\nThe two Bruneians doing very well still in the competition in the\nhigh jump leg of the decathelin\n\n\nSalmon Segar despite having some trouble at one point seven seven\nmetres and has found himself in good stead now at one point eight three\nmetres\n\n\nNow a horrible jump there\n\n\nThe takeoff was totally wrong and he knew it all the way\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nHis takeoff was certainly too near and uh it is all back to\nsquare on again for him\n\n\nHe has got trouble at one point eight three\n\n\nLeonardo is he gonna leap over his limitations now\n\n\nInteresting in the uh decathelin high jump especially since you\njoined us uh a two leaders have failed to go pass one point seven seven\nmetres and that is the unheralded athletics at the moment who are dominating\n\n\nWell before Leondardo Orbligado will try to jump and clear one\npoint eight three metres and we have to sort out some height problems here we\nwill have to go for a commercial break\n\n\nWe will join you later \n\n\n\n<$C> \n\nSo they have a very good streak running into the seventeenth\nSEA Games in Singapore in the Women's four hundred metres final and the\ndefending SEA Games champion is in this first semi-final Ludang Arpinpu\n\n<$D> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$C> \n\nOnce again checking on the line up again Ravia Abdul Salam of\nBrunei of Malaysia lane two Alina Genosa of Philippines in lane three and\nlane number four Kin Mar Que of Myanmar Ludang Pinpu of Thailand the uh\ndefending SEA Games champion and also the record holder at the South East\nAsia at the Women's four hundred metres is in lane number five and in lane\nnumber Noor Hanani of Brunei <unclear> word </unclear> outsider but still\ncould shock\n\n\nThe first three and the fastest two losers will qualify for the\nfinal tomorrow\n\n\nFinally it is a clean start and a very good takeoff by the Thai who\nhas overtaken the Bruneian ladies straight away\n\n\nLudang Pinpu she wouldn't wanna assert and release her strength so\nmuch today save it more for the final tomorrow\n\n\nShe is a hot favourite to win her second consecutive SEA Games gold\nmedal and straight away we can see only one clear runner in this four hundred\nmetres first semi-final for the women's\n\n\nShe knows that she is uh relax a little bit coming into the final\nhundred metres chased only by Malaysia's Ravia Abdul Salam\n\n\nBut it is uh Ludang Pinpu all the way easing up knowing that all\nenergy would be needed for tomorrow's final\n\n\nFifty-six seconds the time Malaysia's uh Ravia Salam comes in in\nsecond place\n\n\nIn third place Philippines Alina Genosa\n\n\nIn fourth place Kin Mar Que of Myanmar and in uh fifth place Noor\nHanani of Brunei who has overtaken almost instantly when the gun went off\n\n<$D> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$C> \n\nShe has just striding to the finish line\n\n\nIt has been rounded to uh fifty-nine point nine seconds her time\nfor the first semi-final way outside her record of fifty-three point point\nfour four seconds\n\n\nBut she will be gunning for that only in the final and she has\ncertainly qualify for it with this easy run in the first semi-final\n\n\nThere you are no expression on the face at all just getting on with\nthe job and qualifying for the big race\n\n<$D> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$C> \n\nSo Ludang Pinpu is in good form and she has qualified for the\nfour hundred metres final for uh women and her closest rival in the next\nsemi-final Perla Balatulan of the Phillipines and Rama Chandran Shanti of\nMalaysia\n\n\nAnd there are three the first three to qualify and the two fastest\nlosers will make it to the final\n\n\nAltogether only nine competitors taking part in the four hundred\nmetres race so only one of them will be left out of the final\n\n\nAnd with the the Bruneian lady returning a very poor time I am sure\nthe next four ladies in the next semi-final will just have to go through the\npace and run through it to qualify for it\n\n\nUh we have the line up for semi-final number two in the four\nhundred metres women\n\n\nRama Chandran Shanti of Malaysia in lane three Philippines Perla\nBalatulan in lane four Thailand's uh Salirad Srimake in lane five and\nBrunei's Masita Kaymatjumat in lane number six\n\n\nFour lanes taken up only\n\n\nMalaysia's G Shanti\n\n\nHere is the lady who might pose some problems for Nudang Pinpu\n<unclear> word </unclear> reputed to be in very good form for the four\nhundred metres Perla Balatulan\n\n\nThailand's other four hundred metres runner Salirad Srimake of\ncourse the Thais are well-known for producing great runners in their sprints\nfrom a hundred to the four and Masita Kaymatjumat of Brunei taking up lane\nnumber eight\n\n<$D> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd while we are waiting the start let me tell you that the\nhigh jump for decathlon for men\n\n\nThe Bruneian athlete Domingo Kappal has cleared one point eight\nnine metres Leonardo Orbligardo of the Phillipines is next\n\n\nBut now we await the start of the women's four hundred metres\nsemi-final number two\n\n\nA very good start by the Thai athlete once again and straight away\nshe has overtaken Mari Masita Kaymatjumat of Brunei\n\n\nSalirad Srimake with a nice lead closely chased by uh Perla\nBalatulan of Phillipines and Malaysia's uh Shanti is making up some ground as\nwell but it is the Thai athlete going all the way by herself now\n\n\nHere is another one Thai race\n\n\nShe will come into the last hundred metres all on her own and\nShanti and Balatulan who have been reputed to be in good form\n\n\nBut she is not really showing it at this semi-final but Salirad\nSrimake is and she is coasting home\n\n\nCan she beat fifty-five point nine nine seconds\n\n\nYes it is a much better time than uh her compatriot Ludang Pinpu\nin the first semi-first final fifty-five point eight one seconds\n\n\nComing in second Raman Chandran Shanti of Malaysia and in third\nplace Salirad Srimate of Thailand\n\n\nSo a good time for the Thai Salirad Srimate\n\n\nWe will come back in a short while but first we will go back to\nthe studios and pause for some commercial break", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "da8f11a9-e909-4c18-9200-1cd65e7310cd", "added":

round\n\n<$A> \n\nLike they say Malaysia obviously be the favourites but given\nthe home ground advantage and what support we can get from the crowd a draw\nmight be enough I mean think about it a draw with Malaysia and if somehow the\nIndonesians can fend off the Malaysians those difference might be the key\n\n\nOf course the question is whether five one is enough because\nMalaysia obviously they're a much sharper team and could well wreck up a much\nbigger score against Indonesians\n\n\nGood play there by <unclear> word </unclear> Hassan\n\n\nHe's pulled it a bit too wide bring the ball out\n\n<$B> \n\nIndonesians looked like all finished but uh they might want\nto try to put in a goal to save some credibility and it was Ibrahim Teklan\nagain to the rescue\n\n<$A> \n\nCaught in

back\n\n\nIbrahim now onto the captain's Suranto <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nWell played Ibrahim startled Suranto Suranto still with the ball\n<unclear> word </unclear> Singh on him\n\n\nBit of a

</unclear> try to\nkeep the ball in play not successful\n\n\nSuhanto again He trying to the cross in and give a long corner to\nIndonesia\n\n\nGood play by Danker\n\n\nAll the way down to the Indonesian half\n\n\nMaybe a hit in for Indonesia\n\n\nGood play by Razak\n\n\nRanjid has it on the right now\n\n\nRazak's just thrown the ball wide on the right nobody picking it\nup\n\n\nHe's got back the ball trying to put the reverse touch\n\n\nRanjid letting it go out of play Sending sends it to Eugene Eugene\ntrying his way trying to <unclear> word </unclear> his round into the dee\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd there is the horn for the full-time whistle\n\n\nSingapore wrapping up a very impressive five one victory\n\n\nGoals by Gavin Dan Royan Ranjid Singh uh two by Mohammud Noor Adam\nand one by one Roslis uhm were responsible for the five goals\n\n\nIndonesia's consolation coming from Randy Lai\n\n\nBoth these teams obviously had to face the group favourite\nMalaysia but on the surface of it

{"text": "<$A> \n\nAnd uh welcome sports fans to the Toa Payoh swimming the venue\nof the platform diving for women\n\n\nYou're watching Magdeline Wong doing a her seventh dive\n\n\nUh she's already done uh four this morning and this afternoon they\nare doing four more dives and uh she took it off from the five metre platform\n\n\nMagdeline Wong coming in uh in the eighth position uh out of eight\ngirls so far in this platform competition for diving and uh not a very good\nround of scores for Magdeline unfortunately and she may uh still remain in\nthat eighth position\n\n\nAnd uh with me here is uh Toto my co-commentator and perhaps he'd\nlike to give you a run down on this Indonesian diver coming up\n\n\nWell the ten metre platform is a long way up and uh you're heading\nthe water uh at the probably maximum velocity coming in perhaps around well\nfifty kilometres per hour and uh it could uh do quite a bit of damage if you\ndon't have a proper entry\n\n\nAnd next we have a a Thai diver BumbrunRob An Annong uh she is\nranked number four at the moment\n\n\nUh she slipped tow position she ranked second coming in for this\nafternoon's uh round of dives and now she has dropped two positions to fourth\nposition\n\n\nAnn Onarnong of Thailand on the five metre platform\n\n\nOh not a very good dive and uh I think she's not going to be able\nto even hold her fourth position with dives like that\n\n\nIt's a bit unfortunate\n\n\nIf you watch from the slow mo replay uh she didn't really make uh\nthe dive completely and uh she was uh rather sloppy coming in into the entry\n\n\nThe uh judging has improved tremendously uh from yesterday\n\n\nI was told that two of the judges that judged yesterday have been\nremoved because of inconsistency in their scoring and as a result of which uh\nwe have a better scoring uh at least better consistency among the diving\njudges and this is uh Masophie of the Philippines on the ten metre platform\n\n\nBack one and a half somersault and uh that's unfortunately an over\nspun\n\n\nYou know in the straight position it's a bit difficult to do your\nuh uh spins around and uh the control is vital there and uh it's a bit\nunfortunate but for Masophie scoring only threes and threes and a halves\n\n\nAnd now we have uh the leader of the pack Sowani of Thailand\n\n\nBack two and a half in a pipe position with a rather high degree of\ndifficulty two point nine from the ten metre platform\n\n\nShe nailed that one very very nicely and uh that was the most\ndifficult on her repertoire with the two point nine degree of difficulty and\n\n\nAnd a little bit problem with the focus with overhead camera but\nnevertheless you could see that uh she did fairly well and uh she will\nprobably win the gold medal in this uh round of uh platform diving for women\n\n\nVery good dive from the Myanmar diver and now this is the that all\nSingaporeans uh should uh look out for little Pearl Wee diving from for\nSingapore\n\n\nUh Pearl is a newcomer where diving is concerned she's only started\ntraining about a year ago and she's already showing great promise\n\n\nPearl Wee from the five metre platform with a handstand dive\n\n\nShe's suppose hold it uh well there's no really specific rule but\nyou must hold it in a reasonable time and I suppose the judges uh have agreed\nthat uh it is reasonable and uh a very scores there for Pearl Wee of\nSingapore\n\n\nThat's one name all Singaporeans should look out for in the uh\ndiving calendar for the next uh few years and I hope Pearl will continue with\nher diving training\n\n\nAnd next we have another uh up and coming diver representing\nSingapore Magdeline Wong and she should do very very well in years to come\ngiven proper encouragement\n\n\nMagdeline from the five metre platform also doing a handstand dive\nsimilar to the one that Pearl did\n\n\nAnd as you watch that replay technically they must hold that\nhandstand for a reasonable period of time to show proper control\n\n\nAnd uh a fairly good round for Magdeline Wong another name to watch\nout for in diving\n\n\nAnd Bonwonroc of Thailand in the ten metre board ten metre platform\n\n\nGoing through her motions in her mind\n\n\nTakes a great deal of concentration here inward dive two and a half\nsomersault\n\n\nNot a very good entry execution was okay it's only towards a\nmasked?? uh half somersault but uh she quit on the dive\n\n\nAnd coming up now we have uh Obiater Masophie of the Philippines\n\n\nAnother arms tand dive with a double somersault in the pipe\nposition\n\n\nMasophiw Obiater of the Philippines\n\n\nYes she should get a six and half there five and a half six and a\nhalf points\n\n\nHere's that replay there\n\n\nYes about five and a half and six and a half point\n\n\nAnd now coming up uh I think\n\n\nShe'll most probably win the gold medal uh Sawani of Thailand\n\n\nYes uh unless she's a complete fail dive uh she would uh definitely\nwalk away with the gold medal for Thailand\n\n\nAnother armstand dive double somersault this time in the pipe\nposition\n\n\nGood control\n\n\nGood entry and uh that definitely will win her the gold medal\n\n\nWatch the control there\n\n\nVery nicely control and uh jubilation in the Thai camp and that was\nthe gold medal dive from uh Chuck Awana Sawani from Thailand congratulated by\nher teammates and officials\n\n\nAnd overall uh that completes the concludes the platform diving for\nwomen\n\n\nThe winner as we have said earlier on was uh Chuck Awana Sawani of\nThailand with uh three hundred and sixty-six point zero five point\n\n\nIn second position we have Dwee Marestuti of Indonesia with uh\nthree hundred and forty-seven point eight points and in third position we\nhave uh Mikchrome Myer Solisito of Indonesia with three hundred and\nthirty-one point one five points\n\n\nAnd uh there is a lull now in the diving uh complex uh as we get\nready for the next event and that is the men's platform diving and uh I think\nthis will probably uh start in about uh twenty minutes' time\n\n\nYou have the results there uhm the Thai girl doing very very well\nuh leading by easily twenty twenty points from second place\n\n\nUh yes Pearl uh finished sixth in her first SEA Games and uh\nactually the two girls Pearl Wee and Magdeline Wong have done very very well\nuh considering that uh it's been a long long time since we've had uh uh\ndivers especially lady divers in our diving competition and uh let's hope\nPearl Wee and Magdeline Wong will continue will their efforts and perhaps in\nthe next SEA Games they should hopefully win at least a medal in the diving\ncompetition\n\n\nAnd uh as we get ready now for uh the men's uh platform event uhm\nthe divers are uh starting to warm up uh for the event uhm there was a\ntremendous downpour the heavens opened up over here at Toa Payoh and uh\nthere's a very very happy diver there and with that we hand you back to\nCaldecott Hill for more reports on the seventeenth SEA Games \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nYes uh unfortunately for Eric Boheng uh he was expected to win\nthis race and uh I must say Desmond swam a good race unfortunately he could\nnot uh master enough uh power to get a lead in the breaststroke\n\n\nIt's very important in the individual medley to get a lead in the\nbreaststroke leg because as you finish your breaststroke and you go on to\nyour freestyle leg your opponent is still swimming a slower breaststroke leg\nand therefore you can get uh uh an easy lead in him but uh uh unfortunately\nfor Desmond he just could not uh get ahead of uh of uh Rattapong in in the uh\nbreaststroke leg and Rattapong is very strong swimmer\n\n\nUh we watch him swim yesterday and uh Rattapong is just far too\nstrong for Desmond in the freestyle leg and as you can see Rattapong just\npull ahead\n\n\nUhm in any case uh it was a good swim for Desmond and not to take\nanything away from Rattapong who won the event in two minutes zero six point\nnine zero seconds uh just barely uh breaking the record by uh four hundredth\nof a second\n\n\nUhm good swim nevertheless uh Desmond has to be content with a\nsilver medal in two minutes eight point nine eight seconds and uh Sutanto of\nIndonesia in uh two minutes ten point eight four seconds and there you have\nthe official results flashed on your screen\n\n<$B> \n\nI'm very surprised uh with Eric Boheng uh expected him to do\nbetter and uh coming in last when you're defending champion\n\n\nUh a really uh there's no excuse I I I really don't think there's\nan excuse for that uh I really don't know what happen but uh for a defending\nchampion to end up uh a wooden spoon in the event is uh uh really I really\ndon't know\n\n\nThere there could be uh uh more acceptable reason\n\n\nHe just gave up\n\n\nYea but that's not until after tomorrow or day after\n\n\nAnd now uh as we wait for the uh relay event for the women let's uh\ngo for a commercial break\n\n\nWelcome back to Toa Payoh and uh we now have the start of the four\nby hundred metres freestyle uh for women\n\n\nSingapore is featured in lane number four and the first swimmer for\nSingapore is Adeline Lim\n\n\nAnd Singapore is in the lead Adeline now uh you can see in the\nmiddle of your screen there's Adeline Lim swimming for Singapore leading the\npack uh coming into the first turn and uh Adeline has turned in twenty-eight\npoint six nine seconds following uh closely by Indonesia and uh Thailand\nIndonesia is represented by Katherine Masulia and uh Thailand is represented\nby Johati Terongsawat and even\n\n\nAnd Ng Chiang Ling is taking off the second position for Singapore\n\n\nNg Chiang Ling has gone up and this is going to be a very exciting\nrace\n\n\nThe uh record holder for this event is the team from Indonesia\nestablished in nineteen ninety-one in the time of four minutes zero point\nnine zero seconds\n\n\nWhat a race this is\n\n\nVery very close race between the three countries Indonesia\nSingapore and Thailand and they're neck to neck and it looks like it's\nThailand slightly Singapore with uh Singapore in second position and\nIndonesia lying third for the moment and uh taking over for the third leg is\nMay Wee for Singapore\n\n\nActually it's a very good uh best kept secret so far\n\n\nWe didn't even know that Jos Joscelin is gonna swim the anchor\nuntil just a few minutes ago they would not release the uh position of the\nswimmers and now it's uh May Wee who has taken the lead over for Singapore\n\n\nSingapore in the lead uh with uh Indonesia it's Thailand in second\nposition and Indonesia in third position\n\n\nMay Wee leading for Singapore and it's Joscelin Yeo Singapore's\nheroine taking on the anchor leg swimming the last one hundred metres in this\nfour by hundred metres freestyle relay for women\n\n\nUnless something dreadful happen nobody is gonna catch up with\nJoscelin\n\n\nJoscelin is easily leading by uh two body length\n\n\nShe's just turn for the last leg of this four by one hundred metres\nfreestyle relay for women and Singapore's it's going to win its fourth gold\nmedal in this uh swimming event \n\n<$B> \n\nWhat a great race by the four girls Uh the four girls\nrepresented Singapore Adeline Lim uh Ng Chiang Ling May Wee and Joscelin Yeo\n\n\nYes May Wee swam a very very good race and uh that's not taking\naway from the rest of the girls all of them swam exceedingly well and May Wee\nwas the one who uh uh extending the lead for

{"text": "<$A> \n\nThe start of the second game\n\n\nThe first one having been won in handsome style by Singapore fifteen\nto seven\n\n\nSingapore on the right side of your screen\n\n\nPhilippines was a little cynical with its serve love all\n\n\nThat was on the line\n\n\nPhilippines grabbing the first point one zero\n\n\nThat went right\n\n\nGood save from Singapore and that was a weak return\n\n\nI'm half surprised that they can't reach that one\n\n\nIt was perfectly set up for the Philippines to drive it down to the\nSingapore court\n\n\nSo Philippines leading one zero\n\n\nWell that's coming over for Singapore\n\n\nOh no oh that's a bad defend of Singapore\n\n\nLet's see if they should try to block this one\n\n\nOh yes it's just too easy\n\n\nSingapore a little bit unsettled at this stage and let's hope that\nuh they realise that they haven't won yet\n\n\nLet's have a what happened was the oh that short set set up by\nSingapore side very effective for the Philippines in this array\n\n\nThat was out but it was deflected by the Singa by the Philippine\ndefender\n\n\nSingapore trailing one two\n\n\nAnd that was a good short set\n\n\nTwo one Philippines\n\n\nFor all we should have got that Singapore's number two Liew Teow\nKah number eleven scaling heights went right on top of the net and force it\nin between the little gap between the blockers and the net\n\n\nPhilippines saying thank you very much we'll do exactly the same\nthing\n\n\nPhilippines three one\n\n\nThat was bad bounce from Singapore's Ng Chee Ho and I'm not\nsurprised that the Philippines leading four one\n\n\nNot by tinge of any spectacular or play from them mind you more\nbecause of Singapore's errors and the this is a timely call out a timely time\nout called by the Singapore coach Chen as uh the score is four one\n\n\nWe don't want things to deteriorate any further than this\n\n\nWe want to stand uh any chance of getting into the game without a\ngreat deal of effort\n\n\nSingapore then trailing one four and Philippines with the serve\n\n\nRight in front of the net of Singapore's Aubrey Ong number two here\nhe is with a short set <unclear> word </unclear> nicely by Chian Lin Chong\nnumber ten\n\n\nThat was Kay of uh Singapore just trying to do a little bit too\nmuch off balance and he tried to to set it up\n\n\nThe ball went over the net too close to the and well it went over\nthe Philippines side\n\n\nSingapore serve\n\n\nStill the Singapore team and a great deal of oh it must have been\ntoo long yes it's way out\n\n\nDon't know what Kay was trying to do there\n\n\nMade a couple of mistakes in a row\n\n\nThat's going out as well and the one from Oliver Balzeh\n\n\nSo both teams showing signs of not too very settled but broke off\nwith that serve from the from that smash from the Philippines is the is the\nserve again\n\n\nThat's right one four Singapore behind\n\n\nIt's time they did something to get a few points on the board\n\n\nWith good luck Singapore could set it up\n\n\nSingapore team losing confidence\n\n\nOh that's an effective\n\n\nYes even the Philippine player number seven Bob Malenlub said yes I\ndid touch that before it went out\n\n\nSingapore gets a point then two four trailing in the second game\n\n\nWonderful block two of the taller players from the Singapore side\nnumber ten and eleven Chiang Yu Chang and Lui Teow Kah\n\n\nSingapore keeping up three four\n\n\nThere you are and it's all tied up this time the Philippines wants\nthe to have a substitution\n\n\nIn comes Roskito <unclear> word </unclear> <unclear> word\n</unclear> there goes Oliver Balzeh number two\n\n\nHere's the new player number six Roskito <unclear> word </unclear>\n<unclear> word </unclear> First <unclear> word </unclear> to the ball\n\n\nAnd that was the you can watch here the captain of the Philippine\nteam Antonio Ladimo Junior slamming that down\n\n\nOh that was right that was out\n\n\nIn the flurry of the battle Bob Halinup number seven not able to\ncontrol the ball\n\n\nIt's still four all Singapore with the serve\n\n\nThe red bulls from Singapore\n\n\nThat was long\n\n\nThat was right and Singapore for the first timeof this game move\nahead five points to four in this set the Philippines coach Sinthornio\n<unclear> word </unclear> says okay I want to talk you fellows come up and he\ngets thirty seconds to talk things over trying to find out what happened\n\n\nPhilippines was way ahead four one\n\n\nYou see the smiles on the Singapore teams on the Singapore faces\n\n\nFive four Singapore ahead\n\n\nThere is Liew Teow Kah all one point eight four metres of him\nbehind that shot <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nNg Chee Ho Singapore ahead four six\n\n\nAn infringement from Chia Min Chong of Singapore <unclear> word\n</unclear> embarassment perhaps\n\n\nWell that was a bad serve\n\n\nBob Malinup\n\n\nHe's made a few errors for his side\n\n\nSix five\n\n\nSingapore fourth set coming on and I said yes and he took full\nadvantage of that\n\n\nThere was no one blocking up there Rostiko <unclear> word\n</unclear> Kamandian for the Philippines putting it other way\n\n\nNow there you saw the Singapore team taking the the blockers on the\nPhilippines side out\n\n\nThey meant to have attempted uh pretended to spike the ball and\nthat was <unclear> word </unclear> wide and Singapore pulling ahead steadily\n\n\nSingapore should be able to get this over\n\n\nWonder if the Philippines can?\n\n\nOh that's a weak return from the Philippines\n\n\nAnd that's <unclear> word </unclear> yes went out the fingers of\nthe defenders the setters <unclear> word </unclear> and Arthur <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n\nAnd Singapore ahead eight five and Mahmon with the serve of the\nPhilippines number five\n\n\nLoo Weng Hwa\n\n\nHe's right on really victory as that went in eight five\n\n\nI think it was long Oh no I think touch by one of the players on\nthe Singapore side deflected out\n\n\nSo Philippines get to serve and it's Rostiko <unclear> word\n</unclear> Kamandian <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nThat was a surprising attack from Singapore's Tay Chee Keong the\nsetter Au Puay Yong instead of serving it to the front serve it to the back\n\n\nAnd Chee Keong was up to the challenge\n\n\nLoo Weng Hwa definitely the live wire right now rallying his team\n\n\nNine five with Sing Singapore ahead of the Philippines and this is\ndefinitely not a result that was that would was expected by the other teams\nin the SEA Games\n\n\nIt was deflected and it was a net infringement by the Philippines\n\n\nNet infringement by the Philippines and their uh their captain\narguing and he is going to be given a talking to by the first referee\n\n\nSingapore flag as I mention coming out and the well as you can see\nat the base of your picture Antonio talking back to the second referee which\nyou're not suppose to actually\n\n\nThe rules actually say that if there're any protest the only people\nwho can actually direct them are the coach as well as the captain and the\nAntonio is actually the captain\n\n\nI don't know what the protest was but perhaps he was just\nprotesting too much\n\n\nWell back to play and Singapore straying their shots and that was a\nyawning gap back there which the Philippines exploited to great effect\n\n\nThey get to serve five to ten oh that's too close to the net\n\n\nSingapore hasn't doesn't seem to be as settled as in the first game\nbut perhaps it was the Philippines who has began to tighten their game just a\nlittle more\n\n\nHere we go with uh Oh yes Antonio Antonio <unclear> word </unclear>\nJunior number captain doing the captain's job for the Philippines seven ten\nthey're still trailing\n\n\nBut Singapore not doing what they should be that's a well it's a\npoor set and in comes Tan Hai Peng and out goes Ng Chee Ho number twelve man\n\n\nTan Hai Peng the most exuberant player at the Singapore side and\nhe's a brilliant player but uh his sometimes his brilliance causes him to\nmake little errors unnecessary ones\n\n\nAnd the time Phauy Bao Shen with Singapore leading ten points to\nnine in the second game of this best of five game encounter\n\n\nThe Philippines putting up a much stronger defence as well as uh uh\nattack\n\n\nUhm I think that this has forced Singapore into quite a number of\nerrors and it is to their credit Singapore credit that they have maintained\ntheir their lead uhm but uh it's gonna be a tight one the rest of this game\n\n\nThe players come back then with the score nine ten in favour\nSingapore what the Philippines were to serve <unclear> word </unclear> with a\npony tail\n\n\nThe Singapore defence doing well behind the three legal line\n\n\nThat's the second point that they have scored\n\n\nOh it's deflected\n\n\nBob Halinub number seven of the Philippines <unclear> word\n</unclear> net\n\n\nEleven nine\n\n\nThe ball dipped as he went over the net oh yes Singapore\nretrieving but it went out\n\n\nPhilippines nine eleven\n\n\nSingapore get to serve and uh eleven for Singapore\n\n\nPhuay Teow Kah pouting his lips in anticipation\n\n\nThat's a very hard serve and it's went out the solid wall\nSingapore\n\n\nI can tell you that Antonio <unclear> word </unclear> their\ncaptain was amazed that the that his full-blooded smash watch him coming it\nin and watch the ball rebounding off the block and the the expression on his\nface was priceless as he saw that the ball had rebounded and that the\nPhilippine that his team could not retrieve

{"text": "<$A> \n\nAnd a very warm welcome to you to the Toa Payoh Sports Complex\nfor the start of the fourth day of swimming events here at the Seventh\nSouth-East uh uh the seventeenth South-East Asia Games\n\n\nUh where the <unclear> word </unclear> of Prime Minister Mister Goh\nChok Tong to watch the uh events which everybody is waiting for the fifty\nmetres freestyle for men\n\n\nAnd we have introduction of swimmers here in lane number five is\nRichard Sambera of Indonesia lane\n\n\nNumber six is Chakasay of Thailand\n\n\nLane seven we Harold Gan and in lane number eight Raymond Papha\n\n\nAng Peng Siong exceeded uh the best swimmer in this uh heats this\nmorning\n\n\nHe is in lane number four and he should be expecting a good fight\nfrom lane three Wisneil of Indonesia on his left\n\n\nAnd uh Peng Siong has shaven his head for this event\n\n\nThis is gonna be a very interesting race\n\n\nAnd off to a very very good start and uh Peng Siong right in the\nlead all the way the twenty-five metre mark that's Chia Peng Siong followed\nby Richard Sambera and uh and the top of the cream is uh Singapore Harold Gan\nout to <unclear> word </unclear> and it's Peng Siong yes that's Peng Siong in\nthe lead in a time of twenty-three point six seven seconds\n\n\nIn second position we have Richard Sanbera at twenty-three point\nseven three and third position went to uh Wisneil of Indonesia in twenty-four\nseconds\n\n\nIt is a frustrating race here by uh Peng Siong whose time of\ntwenty-three point six seconds although has <unclear> word </unclear> not\nbroken his previous record is still good enough for the gold medal and that's\nPeng Siong with his shaven head winning the gold medal the only events that\nhe's swimming and he has won the gold medal and look at how happy he is with\nhis shaven head\n\n\nAng Peng Siong the old man of swimming here with a round of\napplause from our Prime Minister and also Defence Min Minister Doctor Yeo\nNing Hong and the president of the Singapore Amateur Swimming Association\nVictor Goh Yong Hong\n\n\nAnd there you have the official result lane number four was Ang\nPeng Siong in twenty-three point six seven seconds\n\n\nIn second position is lane number five Richard Sambera of Indonesia\ntwenty-three point seven three\n\n\nIn third position lane number three uh Wisneil of Indonesia in\ntwenty-four seconds flat\n\n\nAnd let's watch the replay here\n\n\nYes it was a very close race but uh actually Toto in a race like\nthis you really don't really bother about strategy you just go in and if you\nnotice I don't think any of the swimmers took a breath at all throughout the\nwhole race\n\n\nUh they just took a deep breathe at the start and if at all maybe a\nbreath uh halfway down but I don't think any of the swimmers ever took a\nbreath right through\n\n\nWell this is a a typical Ang Peng Siong race\n\n\nUh Peng Siong always starts off very very strong and uh towards the\nend uh he he probably just uh coast <unclear> word </unclear> and uh another\nfive more metres I think uh Richard would have uh beaten Peng Siong but\nnevertheless\n\n\nYes that's not a fifty-five metre race and that's Peng Siong\n\n\nThis is why Peng Siong doesn't want to swim the hundred metres\nbecause he knows that uh he just doesn't have the uh stamina to carry out\nthis uh uh uh hundred metre race but fifty metres is still very good for him\n\n\nAnd uh with that we'll cross over for the last five minutes of the\nhockey game uhm and we'll come back to the Toa Payoh Swimming Complex later\non \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd this the introduction of the swimmers for the two hundred\nmetres breath stroke the second event this evening\n\n\nWe've just introduced Joselin Yeo in lane number one and in lane\nnumber two we have Sita of Thailand\n\n\nNow Joscelin uh qualified seventh in in the heats this morning\nthat's why she's in lane number one\n\n\nAnd uh I don't know uh what her strategy is and I hope uh she\nshould win another medal for Singapore\n\n\nNevertheless that's an introduction there and lane number five we\nhave Duyuen Ti Pong uh followed by the second Duyuen Ti Pong from Vietnam and\nthis is lane number six Buwicks Buwickshit of Thailand in lane number six\n\n\nAnd that's May Ooi of Singapore in lane number seven and in lane\nnumber eight we have Rita Mariani of Indonesia\n\n\nNow although Joscelin is in lane number one she will be at the\nbottom of your screen\n\n\nUh watch out for her because uh we really don't know anything can\nhappen\n\n\nIt's the uh one of the slower lanes on the outside but uh well\nthere's four lengths of the pool to go and uh we're expected something from\nJoscelin\n\n\nOver to you Toto\n\n\nI don't know it's really fabulous uh the effort by Joscelin but I\nwondering while you were giving the commentary let me add the qualifying\ntimes uh from the heats this morning\n\n\nYou know Joscelin almost didn't make it\n\n\nShe qualified seventh like I said her time during the heats this\nmorning was two minutes fifty-three point three one and Rita Mariani\nqualified last with two minutes fifty-three point six one\n\n\nIf Joscelin had just slowed down uh by a tenth or two-tenth of a\nsecond she would have been out of the finals\n\n\nBut uh nevertheless uh Joscelin swimming in lane number one winning\nher sixth gold medal\n\n\nI think it's May Ooi uh in sorry it's it's Rita Mariani in third\nplace Rita Mariani in third place\n\n\nUhm there's Joscelin in lane number one\n\n\nShe's extremely strong last five metres as she lunges towards the\nwall and it's a new record time by the way two minutes thirty-four point\neight seven seconds\n\n\nAnd uh Toto this is a typical commentator's nightmare when you have\nswimmers so far apart coming in so close together\n\n\nRight it's very hard for us to spot them and to call them out but\nnevertheless uh uh the important thing is Joscelin has won and what a night\nit is for Singapore\n\n\nThe first two event and we've got two goals already tonight\n\n\nFirst by Ang Peng Siong second by Joscelin Yeo and uh we are gonna\nhave a replay now of the last hundred\n\n\nYes that's uh\n\n\nOne fifteen point six one in the first hundred metres by Joscelin\n\n\nYou know Toto we've got great swimmers uh all these years but\nnothing nobody has come close to Joscelin because she's really an all-rounded\nyou know she swims all the strokes very very well\n\n\nUh we were talking about Junie Sng Junie was very good in in the\nfront corner <unclear> word </unclear> of free-style\n\n\nShe was good in the butterfly but uh\n\n\nAnd and that was it but uh look look uh look at this uh even Pat\nChan in those days\n\n\nPat was a a very good uh free stylist but I don't think Pat uh\nmaybe where if she hears us at the studio well she she fancied swim that\nbreast stroke because it's it's not an easy event to swim and here you have a\ntruly all-rounded uh Joscelin Yeo\n\n\nShe swims every uh stroke just as well and coming in towards the\nlast five metres of this replay she wins the two hundred metres breast stroke\nfor women\n\n\nAnd there you have the results and uh let's hear from our sponsors\n\n\n\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd once again another penalty corner this time conceded by\nFlorence as she obstructed the Indonesian danger girl Johanna\n\n\nWith just over ten minutes left Singapore still lead by that\nsolitary goal scored just before half-time by Delima Isa\n\n\nBut that goal is under pressure now from the Indonesians\n\n\nIt wasn't a clean stop and number eleven of Singapore Ong Kim Choo\nmanaged to clear the ball away\n\n\nThat was the third time she's broken up a a Indonesian short corner\n\n\nHere's Johanna\n\n\nDina trying to squeeze her way through\n\n\nShe manages to win a long corner\n\n\nThat wall was lifted into the dee\n\n\nFlorence good play by Florence\n\n\nShe didn't actually make contact with the ball but she forced Dina\ninto playing a bad pass\n\n\nHit out by Florence once again\n\n\nShe's looking into clear range\n\n\nShe couldn't the stick Johanna was actually obstructing her\n\n\nThat ball lifted into the dee so that should be a sixteen yard hit\nfor Singapore and they would be well-advised to take their time on this one\n\n\nShe finds Dahlia\n\n\nDahlia will send it long to\n\n\nMelanie was trying to get free but Indonesian they pick her up well\n\n\nSiew Keng well stopped by Siew Keng\n\n\nShe found Geraldine who tried to flick it to Melanie\n\n\nSiew Keng once again they're still trying to play up Melanie the\nthe Indonesian girls packed the dee right there and Singapore wasn't able to\nfind the way through\n\n\nWell cut out by Dawn Defol\n\n\nThat allows the Singapore girls time to get back\n\n\nBut I can see a few tired women out there\n\n\nThere's not much help from the frontline coming back to assist the\nmid-field\n\n\nGeraldine played in to Dahlia\n\n\nAnd held <unclear> word </unclear> it up given it Melanie\n\n\nMelanie is trying to free Delima\n\n\nThe ball has foul <unclear> word </unclear> its way through\n\n\nSwee Keng short ball to Delima\n\n\nDelima's round her man or a woman I should\n\n\nLooking for a good cross\n\n\nWell cut-out by the Indonesians\n\n\nA chance there\n\n\nThe ball didn't run right for Dahlia\n\n\nVery good run by Delima\n\n\nThat cross caused quite a bit of panic and confusion in the\nIndonesian defence\n\n\nThe ball did right run right for Dahli though and Swee Keng Melanie\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nWell played by the goalkeeper\n\n\nGeraldine another chance and somehow the Indonesians managed to\nscramble that one way\n\n\nWell read by Dawn\n\n\nPlayed forward <unclear> word </unclear> to Melanie\n\n\nDahlia trying to free Geraldine inside the dee\n\n\nThere was obstruction so we're gonna see another short corner here\nfor Singapore\n\n\nAnd there's Geraldine Ho the player who won the shot\n\n\nDonna is now going to play the ball back\n\n\nDahlia is set to stop it\n\n\nLet's see what Singapore have up their sleeve this time\n\n\nA bit over elaborate there the Indonesian girls were off the line\nquickly and Singapore have lost the chance to pair that one goal advantage\n\n\nLong ball played out here\n\n\nGeraldine she stopped it well\n\n\nAnd this time I see Dahlia doing her best to get into the box but\nGeraldine's reverse flick did make contact\n\n\nBall still with Singapore though\n\n\nThat looks like obstruction yes it was\n\n\nIt's obstruction\n\n\nOh that was a very poor ball\n\n\nEasily cut out by <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nWith just about five minutes left and the score is still Singapore\none Indonesia nil\n\n\nBoth sides have their chances in this second half but neither has\nbeen able to score so the solitary goal scored just before half time by\nDalima Hither still <unclear> word </unclear> the difference these two teams\n\n\nBall played to Melanie Martin and Singapore has a chance\n\n\nThat ball was a bit too soft by Melanie\n\n\nWell played by Geraldine\n\n\nShe went a long way back there but she was dispossess lifting the\nball into the dee\n\n\nThe Indonesians have been let down by that particular infringement\non many occasions\n\n\nThey've had a lot of possession but that final pass has been\ncalled lifted into the dee on many

{"text": "<$A> \n\nAnd a very good afternoon to you sports fans\n\n\nThis is Fong Ho Beng together with guest commentator Toto Dermati at\nthe Toa Payoh swimming complex bringing you live action of the waterpolo\nwaterpolo game between Singapore and Malaysia\n\n\nSingapore in white caps are leading now by ten goals by nothing and\nit's Malaysia at ten goals to one I beg your pardon\n\n\nMalaysia just broke the guards about two minutes ago uh towards the\nfirst part of the fourth quarter and now Singapore on the attack\n\n\nUh Singapore has been leading all the way and uh they've got the\ngold medal sown up uh signed sealed and delivered so to speak\n\n\nMalaysia needs to beat Singapore to win a medal but it doesn't look\nlike they're gonna do it trailing by ten goals to one\n\n\nAnd now it's uh Malaysia back on the attack Malaysia playing from\nleft to right in the blue caps and that's number seven Choo Keng Soo with the\nball looking for an opening\n\n\nJames Tan James Tan tries a long and Singapore right on attack with\nnumber six there Aw Kam Mun one on one with the goalkeeper\n\n\nIt looks like a penalty shot\n\n\nHigh low he was just a little bit too complacent there one on one\nwith the goalkeeper Aw Aw Kam Mun and he just could not convert\n\n\nThat would be a a nightmare for him for tonight\n\n\nHe could have scored that goal but fortunately it's not a crucial\ngoal\n\n\nIt may just make no difference even if he scored it or not\n\n\nAnd it's Lim Teik Yin with a free throw\n\n\nAnd the cap has come off\n\n\nAnd we are very honoured uh this afternoon to be uh to have the\npresence of none other than President Wee Kim Wee and of course uh we are\nalso very very honoured to have our Prime Minister here with us as well as\nDoctor Yeo Ning Hong\n\n\nYou're watching with great interest this final game and goal scored\nby Matthew oh number six Aw Kum Mun goal number eleven scored by Aw Kum Mun\nof Singapore\n\n\nAnd we are in the fourth quarter of this waterpolo game and watch\nthat goal scored by Aw Kum Mun very nicely done and as I said earlier\nSingapore has already won the goal medal\n\n\nThis game is academic even if they lost this game they would still\nwin the gold medal\n\n\nBut Malaysia has to beat Singapore by at least three goals to\nsecure a silver medal\n\n\nAnd Malaysia who's on the attack even with the goalkeeper coming\nway out to the ten metre mark Tiong Siong Pew being swarmed by Singapore\ndefence Franklin Tan\n\n\nA throw for Franklin and number seven Choo Keng Soo wins a free\nthrow and another goal scored by Tan Kan Ghee\n\n\nEleven to two both goals scored by Tan Kan Ghee cap number two of\nMalaysia and the scored line stands at eleven to two in favour of Singapore\n\n\nWell Toto what are your comments so far about this game\n\n\nAnd Malaysia on the attack once again Hee Ding Tiong switch Choo\nKeng Soo Franklin Tan Tiong Siong Pew and the free throw goes back to Matthew\n\n\nAnd Singapore on the attack Daniel Wee Daniel Wee is trying no\n\n\nHe's given back to Matthew and Matthew tries\n\n\nMatthew Tan the captain of the Singapore team scoring goal number\ntwelve making it a round dozen\n\n\nTwelve two Singapore leading in this fourth quarter of the\nwaterpolo game\n\n\nI was afraid that uh Singapore might be complacent uh at the\nbeginning of this game but apparently not\n\n\nThere's less than two minutes left in uh this whole wa waterpolo\nmatch between Singapore and Malaysia and Singapore is leading twelve to two\nin the fourth quarter\n\n\nMass confusion in in front of the Singapore goal\n\n\nAn ejection of Matthew Tan\n\n\nNo it's Daniel Tan his first ejection for first <unclear> word\n</unclear> foul\n\n\nLee Ding Tiong\n\n\nTang Khoon Ghee\n\n\nChoo Keng Soo\n\n\nDing Keong\n\n\nGood attempt there by number eight Tiong Siong Pew scoring goal\nnumber three for Malaysia\n\n\nMatthew Tan with the ball and being harassed by number twelve James\nTan Fong Ho Yin\n\n\nThe last minute of the game\n\n\nOne minute warning being given and can Singapore make it number\nthirteen\n\n\nEighteen seconds left in the goal <unclear> word </unclear> and yes\nnumber five Ho Wei Meng has made goal number thirteen for Singapore\n\n\nSingapore leading thirteen to three\n\n\nNot much time left in this waterpolo game with forty seconds left\nand uh Malaysia will probably make a fast break of it\n\n\nEven the goalkeeper has come up look at that goalkeeper has come up\nto the halfway mark and they want to try to score another goal but I think\nSingapore is gonna deny them of that\n\n\nAnd they try to\n\n\nYes\n\n\nTiong Siong Pew trying very very hard there and uh Singapore's\ngonna let the clock run now I think uh I think\n\n\nLess than twenty seconds left\n\n\nAnd uh that is the end of the waterpolo game between Singapore and\nMalaysia\n\n\nSingapore winning thirteen goals to three\n\n\nAnd uh we have a host of V I Ps here at this Toa Payoh swimming\ncomplex\n\n\nOur President Wee Kim Wee is here\n\n\nOur Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong is here\n\n\nOur Defence Minister Doctor Yeo Ning Hong is here and uh we're\nwondering who is gonna present the medals to the winners\n\n\nUh it will be a little while yet as the players uh uh get together\nand get ready to for the prize presentation and uh we do not have news yet as\nto who is to present the medal and uh while we're finding out let's go for a\ncommercial break\n\n\nAnd welcome back to Toa Payoh swimming complex as we witness the\nvictory ceremony for the waterpolo competition\n\n\nSingapore has done it again their fifteen goal medal in the series\n\n\nThey have not lost one single waterpolo game in the entire SEA\nGames and SEAP Games series\n\n\nThere was no waterpolo played uh at the first SEAP Games in Bangkok\nin nineteen fifty-nine\n\n\nUh there was no waterpolo uh at Rangoon for the second SEA Games\nbut subsequently there was waterpolo uh being played at every SEA Games and\nSEAP Games after that and this is the fifteen time that Singapore has won and\nthey have not lost one single game\n\n\nNow that's a record for other sports to try to emulate\n\n\nPresident Wee Kim Wee himself is going to present the medal to the\nwinners and uh he's accompanied by Defence Minister Doctor Yeo Ning Hong\n\n\nThat's cer certainly is a singular honour for the waterpolo team\n\n\nA proud moment for Matthew Tan and his boys\n\n\nAll thirteen players going up the rostrum and that's Matthew Tan\nreceiving the gold medal from President Wee and that's Lim Teik Yin Major Lim\nTeik Yin Daniel Wee\n\n\nVery proud moment for the Singapore players\n\n\nAnd Doctor Yeo Ning Hong assisting the President\n\n\nThere's thirteen medals to be given away gets a bit tiring but\nthat's a pleasant task nevertheless\n\n\nGreat moments for the Singapore players\n\n\nThey beat Malaysia this afternoon by the score of thirteen to three\n\n\nAnd Philippines wins the silver medal\n\n\nA lot of veterans on the Philippine team I believe that's one\nplayer who's forty years old\n\n\nHe's almost as old as I am\n\n\nProud moment for the Philippine team as well\n\n\nIt's a tough way to get a medal\n\n\nYou've got five days of competition bruising <unclear> word\n</unclear> competition at that\n\n\nI must say the waterpolo matches uh during this series has not been\nas robust as uh in previous games\n\n\nI've seen players coming up with uh missing teeth and scratches all\nover the backs and uh torn swim suits but uh this particular series the\nseventeenth SEA Games have been rather tame compared to other waterpolo\nmatches\n\n\nPerhaps all the other teams have resigned to the fact that\nSingapore are the kingpins\n\n\nAnd uh Indonesia wins the bronze medal in waterpolo\n\n\nPresident Wee doing the honours\n\n\nThis is indeed a very proud moment to receive a medal from\nPresident Wee Kim Wee himself a moment that all the athletes should treasure\nfor the rest of their lives\n\n\nAnd Doctor Yeo Ning Hong assisting\n\n\nDoctor Yeo the Defence Minister is also the President of the\nSingapore Olympic Sports Council Singapore National of the Council I beg your\npardon\n\n\nAnd talking about that we have a lot of V I Ps here Mister Ng Ser\nMiang the President of the Singapore Sports Council is here Mister S S Dylon\nthe Secretary-General of the uh Singapore National Olympic Council is here\n\n\nPractically anybody who is anybody in sports is here this afternoon\nat Toa Payoh and a round of applause for everybody in particular President\nWee Kim Seng for bracing the occasion\n\n\nAnd the proud moment for the Singapore waterpolo team\n\n\nA round of applause here from Toa Payoh and uh with that we go back\nto the studio for commercial break to be followed by uh a commentary on Sepak\nTakaw by Mark Richmond\n\n<$B> \n\nWelcome to the Singapore Badminton Hall for the Inter-regu\n<unclear> word </unclear> Sepak Takaw finals the gold medal match between\nSingapore and Malaysia\n\n\nThe Singapore trio of Nor Hisham Adam Mohammud Rafi Abdullah Majid\nand Ranji Osmund against Malaysia's world champions Nordin Sabarudin Arshari\nHashim and Rosli Abdul Rafman\n\n\nSingapore down by ten thirteen in the first <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n\nOf course remember they dealt Malaysia a huge psychological blow in\nthe preliminary rounds where they beat the same trio by two sets to love\n\n\nThey qualified for this final by beating the Indonesia trio while\nthe Malaysians overcame the Thai trio in the repeat of uh the last SEA Games\nfinal\n\n\nTen thirteen down the first set and we played thirty-two minutes of\nthis set so far\n\n\nThe ball's gone out to illegal grounds and they refused to get now\nthe advantage to two points the Malaysians up as many as six at one time\n\n\nThey threatened to take the set at thirteen nine but now they're\nfaced with Singapore serving at eleven thirteen\n\n\nWith me is uh Siram Ohmar you've seen so far your comments your\ncomments\n\n<$C> \n\nYes Singapore started off slow four points behind and then\nthey they allow the Malaysians to get far ahead but they've settled down\nafter quite a nervous start\n\n\nThey've come back and they've even manage really quite well\n\n\nUh they just called back another point\n\n\nIt's twelve thirteen\n\n\nSingapore of course one point away now from forcing this just in\nthis first set\n\n<$B> \n\nAll the Singaporeans were down by four love\n\n\nThey came back to join level four all\n\n\nThey were down by ten four\n\n\nThey came back to reduce it to ten nine\n\n\nThey were down by nine thirteen and now they have serve at twelve\nthirteen\n\n\nSo really this regu from them have shown a lot of character\n\n\nHelped a little of course by the Malaysian <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n\nThe takaw has gone out at time and the Malaysians call for a time\nout\n\n\nThe Malaysians haven't really looked very impressive yet neither\nhave the Singaporeans to be fair but the uh considering that they are world\nchampions and they have a very good chemistry between them the combination\nbetween Rosli Abdul Rafman and the smasher chief smasher Shari Hashim hasn't\nbeen very good\n\n\nShari in fact has missed out on a lot of opportunities to kill the\npoints off and in the block department both sides have had one successful\nblock each\n\n<$C> \n\nYes uh Singapore must uh keep their heads together\n\n\nThey're only one point adrift\n\n\nThey were like you said at times uh more than six points adrift\n\n\nThey've pulled back well\n\n\nThey've fought well and I think in the back of the Malaysians\nminds' they will be wondering whether they will ever get to see the end of\nthis because they just can't see it to finish off the Singaporeans", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "24f68cb4-db5b-4e9d-ad5b-7d7dffdeb9f6", "added":

Chong Kim and nice ball played outside by Radi\nMartin\n\n\nKian Wee will chase for this\n\n\nHe keeps it in play well done\n\n\nPaced by Saswa nice move onto David Fariszuan but Malek steps in\n\n\nI must say that the Kedah coach has certainly done his homework\n\n\nOh that's a nice sign Fandi Ahmad indicating that he's a okay and\nready to come back onto the pitch of play\n\n\nJang Jung is charging in\n\n\nOh nice little flick on by V Sundram Moorthy\n\n\nA lot of shirt tugging on the referee didn't see it\n\n\nGood play by Sundram though magnificent skill under the face of\npressure\n\n\nAbbas Said just wasn't there\n\n\nThe cross came in a little bit too early but Abbas deciding to\ncross it back again\n\n\nAlistair Edwards is good on the shot\n\n\nWell blocked out that time by Lee Kian Ong but certainly there was\nsome shirt tugging on the part of uh Faridza Ismail\n\n\nBut there are some space now for Kadir Yahya\n\n\nGood tackle and the ball goes out and a throw in for Singapore and\nthe referee will have to check on the shirt tugging and all the indecent play\nat the moment\n\n\nWe should call it from Faridza Ismail he has certainly been pulling\nSundram back and coming in with very very high challenges\n\n\nSundram turned on and says serve you right\n\n\nBig blast at right at his chest\n\n\nDon't fool around with me\n\n\nYou can't with that sort of service though by Kadir Yahya\n\n\nNazri will win this one\n\n\nGood play by Nazri\n\n\nFaridza Ismail comes in with another big challenge and Singapore\nget their second corner of the evening and they're coming closer now fired up\nby the Kallang roar here\n\n\nCertainly the best support in South-East Asia and that we can\ncertainly find at the National Stadium\n\n\nA corner kick for Singapore Malek Awab will take this one\n\n\nFew players waiting at the penalty box ready to pounce and it's Lim\nTong Hai\n\n\nWow a goal by Lim Tong Hai magnificent\n\n\nHe came in late he ran from deep <unclear> word </unclear> and if\nyou still can't forgive Lim Tong Hai for what he did in the SEA Games I tell\nyou there must be something wrong with you\n\n\nWhat a goal by Tong Hai magnificent run from deep <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n\nThe ball was very inviting hanging in the air by Malek Awab\n\n\nThe goalkeeper came up with a challenge but Tong Hai didn't care\ntwo hoots at all about Ahmad Sobri\n\n\nHe went he banged a header in and what a goal that was for\nSingapore\n\n\nOne nil with one twenty-one minutes of play gone by\n\n\nA goalkeeper claimed that Sundram Moorthy was blocking and he ran\nup free to the referee afterwards to say that Sundram was blocking his view\nand obstructing him but the referee says no goal\n\n\nKedah attack straight away oh look who's there again Lim Tong Hai\nfired up by this evening and even more so now with that goal\n\n\nAnd the Singapore defenders covering for each other so well\n\n\nCan almost <unclear> word </unclear> coming back again in the team\n\n\nTeam spirit is very high and Nazri Nasir is on a high himself\n\n\nAnd some space now for Malek Awab as the Kedah defenders move\nforward to try to reduce the deficit and get the equaliser\n\n\nGood ball in fact sight\n\n\nNo support though and yet he's taken shot from an acute angle\n\n\nWell a good build-up and a nice counterattack from Singapore\n\n\nThe Kedah players now will have to move up front and try to get a\ngoal back and that will allow some of Singapore's ball players more room to\nmove especially players like Sundram Moorthy Fandi Ahmad and Alistair Edwards\n\n\nIt's the second goal of the season\n\n\nFandi Alistair trying to work something in the air here for\nSingapore\n\n\nIt's still in the air the ball's not down yet\n\n\nFinally it is brought down by Lee Kian Hong the lion <unclear> word\n</unclear> take control of things for Kedah\n\n\nAnd Kedah players are certainly coming in very hard on the\nSingapore players Malek getting it up\n\n\nOught to be fair and to give credit to the Kedah coach Robert\nAlberts\n\n\nHe has done his homework and he has done tried every mean and\ntrying another five Singapore's white flank even to uh shirt tugging which\nthey've done on to Sundram Moorthy\n\n\nThere he is Robert Alberts the Dutch coach\n\n\nLeft to be seen especially in the game against Selangor\n\n\nNever write a side off just like that least of all Kedah\n\n\nMohamud Sobri hasn't had very good experiences here at the National\nStadium that's his eleventh goal conceded on this ground\n\n\nThe Kallang wave just urging the team on Sundram will chase for\nthis\n\n\nGood work by Sundram Moorthy he wins a throw in very smart play\n\n\nOh considering that he's been so unfairly treated by his opponents\nthis evening I think Sundram has come up very well to the challenge so far\n\n\nMalek Awab with a long throw\n\n\nAlistair Edwards takes it on his chest fires a back kick to no\neffect though\n\n\nTong Hai confidence coming back in him the way he controlled the\nball\n\n\nJang Jung nice little ball turning defend into attack straight away\nand look at the time the referee had to stop it but he allows play to go on\n\n\nFandi Ahmad with some space now\n\n\nWell he was a a little bit apprehensive with a shot\n\n\nAt first he decided to take it down <unclear> word </unclear> when\nthe defender came to him he was uh a little shaken by the sight of the\ndefender in front of face and just decided to have a blast at goal that went\nwide\n\n\nRadi Martin loses control over the ball\n\n\nSundram gets it once again kicked from behind but the referee saw\nnothing of it\n\n\nA very poor decision coming from the Selangor referee\n\n\nAnd that time for no reason a foul on the Kedah player he's called\nit\n\n\nMalek had to come up to clear helping Kadir Yahya a little bit on\nhis defensive duties\n\n\nFariza Ismail very closely watching Sundram Moorthy\n\n\nGame is not over yet for Singapore\n\n\nRadi Martin has the ball and some space now\n\n\nJang Jung comes back\n\n\nHe has been the player of the match so far Jang Jung doing so very\nwell in defence\n\n\nHe's cut all of the Kedah crosses and passes into the Singapore\npenalty area\n\n\nThat's his zone and he's taking the real command of it\n\n\nFandi good play despite uh adversity then\n\n\nAlistair Edwards will try to run at goal\n\n\nGood work here by Alistair Edwards showing nice burst of pace\n\n\nAbbas Said with Oahbumi right in front of him decided not to take\nany chances at all with the challenge and risk and injury\n\n\nSawas coming back <unclear> word </unclear> is so very strong in\nthe air and that time Sawas does well\n\n\nMalek Awab though incharacteristically losing the ball\n\n\nGood work by Kedah Nice one-touch football that finally cleared\n\n\nSaban not a very good clearance\n\n\nFandi decided to come in and look at the referee indicating that\nthat was a leg raised but no foul was given\n\n\nKadir will have to clear he does it superbly\n\n\nAbbas Said now with Oahbumi in front of him\n\n\nHeels of ball from the Nigerian and definitely a foul a tackle\ncoming so high Abbas Said is really <unclear> word </unclear> at the moment\nworking and Oahbumi Adigon receives a yellow card\n\n\nSo two Kedah players on a yellow card Oahbumi and Lee Kian Hong\nboth defenders\n\n\nThat should at least check on their high tackles now\n\n\nCertainly good news for Singapore Alistair does well with a header\n\n\nSundram good screening of the ball releases Alistair Edwards and\nHadith Martin trying to ease the pressure a little bit on the Kedah defender\nwho's deciding the clear the ball and give it out for a throw in to Singapore\n\n\nHalf an hour play gone by one nil to Singapore\n\n\nGood ball by Sundram to Malek but Malek's cross was easily headed\nout by Adigon\n\n\nFandi Ahmad trying to weave his way round to players\n\n\nThat dance ended though with a tackle on him\n\n\nKadir Yahya and Fandi will now come in\n\n\nGood play by Fandi\n\n\nAbbas Said has some space decided to take on the control instead\nof using Sundram Moorthy\n\n\nA lot of players falling down the pitch is a little slippery and\nat the same time both teams coming in with crunching tackles\n\n\nThey're not allowing players any time on the ball at all\n\n\nA real fierce competitive football game we have here a delightful\none as well\n\n\nSundram good ball control releases Abbas a first time cross\n\n\nMalek heading it back\n\n\nNazri now with some space\n\n\nIs he gonna shoot\n\n\nNo he tries to use Alistair Edwards in the penalty box\n\n\nGood tackle by Lim Tong Hai\n\n\nHere's Malek Awab\n\n\nFandi now turns\n\n\nNo support\n\n\nOh what a pass exquisite ball by Fandi Ahmad\n\n\nHow did he spot Malek Kawab\n\n\nMalek's cross though was a little bit disappointing but the way\nFandi spotted Malek his vision there was impeccable\n\n\nThat's certainly good spell for Singapore Sundram oh the tackle\ncoming in so hard again\n\n\nThat's magic for you Sundram Moorthy\n\n\nA ball inside was actually a very good one cause Abbas Said made a\nvery late one but well read though by Addi Boon\n\n\nSawas heading it into space\n\n\nNakitin win chase back and win it but only for a short while\n\n\nI don't know what Ng Tiong Kim had in mind then but he certainly\ndidn't tug Fandi out\n\n\nOffside it would have been anyway\n\n\nThey shouldn't give a ball away in mid-field so easily like what\nNazri did\n\n\nA reprieve over them because it's a throw in for Singapore much to\nKedah's dismay\n\n\nThey were hoping that the referee would see it the other way\n\n\nTwelve minutes of play left in the first half Singapore lead by a\nLim Tong Hai goal to nil\n\n\nAbbas leaving it for Fandi\n\n\nGood work by Fandi and Abbas\n\n\nNice little combination Abbas' ball was uh more strange than\nanything else\n\n\nJang Jung the heart of every clearance\n\n\nNazri heading the ball back to Malek Awab and uh some trouble for\nawhile until Tong Hai steps in to clear\n\n\nAnd despite some uh good play by Kedah in mid-field believe it or\nnot Abdul Malek hasn't been tested yet and they haven't had a shot at goal\n\n\nSo considering that I mean Singapore's doing very well defensively\nespecially in particular Jang Jung\n\n\nNakitin once again doing very well with the jump\n\n\nOh good skill but that finish was disappointing\n\n\nA good play by Peter Nakitin showing us what he can do on the air\nand on the ground\n\n\nAnd he is again on the ball stirring it upfront\n\n\nHe knows that his strikers would do the leap ball but with strike\nfalls on Fandi Abbas Malek Alistair and Sundram we certainly do have a lot of\nconfidence in them\n\n\nSome names so long will strike fear in any defences heart\n\n\nOh nice flick by V Sundram Moorthy Sawasdi Matha Dazuki with some\nspace and room to take a shot\n\n\nThe finishing product though was very disappointing\n\n\nJang Jung easily done\n\n\nSundram hastily who is quite bothered by the challenges dished out\non him this evening Sundram\n\n\nFandi squeezing pass two players and releasing Malek Awab\n\n\nThat's definitely a foul and uh a yellow card it should be because\nMalek was on the way to the byline \n\n\nThat should have been a yellow card a foul on any who's brought\nthe referee <unclear> word </unclear> the Singapore player down off the ball\nincident And the referee has decided to uh allow Radi Martin struck free and\nthe Kedah player should be thanking his lucky starts for that Singapore goal\ndo have a free kick from that and another chance to score Tong Hai's in the\npenalty box trying to get his grace Sundram Alistair as well A free kick\nthough by Abbas was floated too close to Ahmad Sibri No one shutting down Lim\nChong Kim at the moment That's Sawas", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

for Singapore also had the first free kick of\nthe match\n\n\nKadir got some space now\n\n\nCan he pick his spot\n\n\nHe tries it and just missing by an inch\n\n\nAbbas Said I think it was just missing it a little bit and Kadir\nYahya's drill inside the penalty box was almost very very effective\n\n\nGood work then by Saswadimata Dazuki winning the ball over to\nDollar Saleh\n\n\nSundram to Zanial then Ahmad Ibrahim\n\n\nThat was definitely a foul by Osami Jalial referee coming up to\nwarn him\n\n\nActually uh pretended that he didn't hear the whistle go at all\n\n\nSaleh <unclear> word

title\n\n\nSundram stepping the pace up for Singapore just now\n\n\nHis first touch just led down V Sundram Moorthy\n\n\nTo be fair to him it wasn't very easy to control the ball not when\nthe defender kept breathing down your neck\n\n\nTapping his ankle but he made the move he built it up\n\n\nHe stepped the pace up a little bit\n\n\nFandi Ahmad continues to run and almost ended up as a goal for\nSingapore\n\n\nAsa Rudin Zanial winning that header over Nazri Nasir\n\n\nNazri up to Fandi\n\n\nWonderful touch by Fandi Ahmad\n\n\nAlan Davidson though twills it easily and as easily as

momentarily\n\n\nFandi well picks it up\n\n\nKadir Yahya with a lot of room right now on the right flank\nrunning down\n\n\nAll the players go inside the penalty box waiting for it and look\nhow Alan Davidson read that one anticipated it so very well just stepped in\ntook control and now he has the ball\n\n\nReleases Zanial Abidin once again\n\n\nSqueeze in from uh Nazri but shows Rafi too much of the ball\n\n\nThis Fandi Ahmad Saswa\n\n\nThe afternoon downpour not helping him at all regaining his\nbalance\n\n\nKadir Sundram Malek has got some space now Malek Kawab\n\n\nThe pass there to Abbas Said\n\n\nIt's a little too far\n\n\nAh lovely play by Alan Davidson once again\n\n\nAbbas Said he's beaten by his Australian compatriot\n\n\nOne nil still the score and that Davidson move certainly sums up\nthe match so far and he has certainly been the key figure\n\n\nNasir Rudin pumps it up upfront\n\n\nIt's for Dollah Saleh\n\n\nBeaten to it by Saswadimata Dazuki Jang Jung Sundram\n\n\nIt's time to turn\n\n\nLooks up for support finds it in the figure of Fandi Ahmad\n\n\nFandi couldn't get anywhere though\n\n\nTrying to actually go round the Pahang middle instead of uh using\nthe flanks which they have done so effectively all season round\n\n\nOh great play by V Sundram Moorthy <unclear> word </unclear>\nhimself there Sundram finds some space\n\n\nCan he find the angle for the shot\n\n\nAhmad Ibrahim would have made a great return if he had connected\ncleanly\n\n\nThe crowd had sense that V Sundram Moorthy actually took a shot\ninstead of playing inside for Abbas Said\n\n\nWhat do you think Jamie\n\n\nAt the moment Ahmad Ibrahim has gone down to take uh Sundram\nMoorthy's right mid-fielder's role and uh Sundram has gone up to corner\n\n\nAbbas Said upfront so even the pattern of play in the Singapore\nside at the is missing\n\n\nDefinitely a foul\n\n\nNot spotted by the referee and I think he's gonna give the yellow\ncard to uh Asimi Dalliel Mo\n\n\nWell he reached for his pocket and thought twice about it\n\n\nIsn't as bad as his earlier tackle on V Sundram Moorthy and as we\nspeak Abbas Said in fact has taken over Sundram's place on right mid-field\nand Sundram has partner Ahmad Ibrahim upfront\n\n\nFandi a free kick inside to V Sundram Moorthy who escaped from his\nmark momentarily but a good tackle then\n\n\nWell recovered Osami Jaliel\n\n\nSundram though forces the corner the second of the match for\nSingapore\n\n\nThe fever though building at the National Stadium\n\n\nThey took quite a while to come back against Pahang in Kuantan\n\n\nCan they do so a little quicker in this match\n\n\nMalek decides to keep the ball in playing across though easy for\nAlan Davidson\n\n\nFandi Ahmad builds it over again\n\n\nWell saved by the defender\n\n\nKadir Yahya will have to use Saswadimata Dazuki\n\n\nThe Pahang players push up very quickly but Rafi Ali though\n\n\nOh the ball had only gone out\n\n\nNot a very good first touch by Rafi\n\n\nAs you'll expect for a team down by a goal to nil\n\n\nJang Jung misses the header\n\n\nDanguh now Nazri Nasir has got imposing figure of Zanial Abidin\nwho screened it very well\n\n\nMalek there did the sensible thing not blasting it against uh\nAzizul Kamaludin the player who has replaced Jose Ariateh and he throws it\nall the way back to the other Malek goalkeeper Abdul Malek \n\n\nWell he certainly must be feeling very unsettled Abdul Malek\nbefore he could even have a catch a glimpse of the ball he had to pick it out\nfrom the back of his net Fandi down to Malek again Sundram Moorthy is racing\nfor that Alan Davidson is there Hits it out only as far as uh Ahmad Ibrahim\nDoes well to turn pass the player Saswadimata picks up the loose ball loses\nJang Jung Rafee good work by Rafee Ali Up by Kadir Yayha though Abbas Said\nand Kadir Yahya both with different roles then Zanial oh lovely click on\nAhmad Eusoff letching onto this one But look who's there again Jang Jung\nKamaludin This is Azarudin passing it He knows Zanial is there so jump a part\nof his all those headers Abbas Said trying to defend Kamal Zahamizan Good\ntackle by Rafee Ali And then by Ahmad Ibrahim Alan Davidson good pass by\nDavidson and finally Singapore <unclear> word </unclear> Rafee Ali giving it\nback to Jang Jung Malek has got some space now in mid-field Decides to use V\nSundram Moorthy We're seeing more and more of this number eighteen now from\nSingapore Kadir Yahya Up high the cross was low and not very good and swung\noutside Rafee to Jang Jung Good play by Rafee Ali Jang Jung holds that up for\na little for the players to come back Keep themselves on an onside position\nFandi trying to goal ball by himself Good work there by Fandi Ahmad and good\nsave by Malek Mohammud Confidence restored Fandi Ahmad and after the goal\nscored against Pahang That was his first goal in five hundred and thirty-two\nminutes of football It's one record which uh Fandi

{"text": "<$A> \n\nResidents of Ulu Pandan and friends we are coming back again to\nUlu Pandan after the last general election\n\n\nWhat do we find\n\n\nWe find that the PAP is on the defensive this time\n\n\nNever before has the PAP been on a defensive in any general election\nbut they are at this particular point of time\n\n\nWhy because the SDP has adopted the right strategy\n\n\nWe have called upon the other opposition parties to field less\ncandidates so that to make this election a by-election\n\n\nWe have the by-election effect and as it turned out on Nomination\nDay the PAP had 41 uncontested seats and there are 40 seats for the people to\nchoose their credible opposition from\n\n\nSo you understand this it is not a step backwards it is not a\nretreat on the part of the opposition it is in fact a strategy that we have\nadopted and the PAP now has got no answer to it because now they are at the\nmercy of the electorate\n\n\nThe electorate can vote credible opposition at their choice\n\n\nWhat is a by-election what is a by-election\n\n\nA by-election is an election when even you vote all the opposition\nthey can never come to power because there is already a government a\ngovernment is already in power that is a by-election\n\n\nSo once the PAP is in power after having got the 41 seats we\nconsider the balance of the seats are contested as a by-election\n\n\nNow this is our strategy and it is the right strategy as has been\nmentioned by Guan Yu Keng\n\n\nThis Jayakumar and all the other PAP members have trying tried to\ndismiss the SDP's strategy but they cannot\n\n\nJayakumar has said what is this that\n\n\nThis strategy is about he says that the people wants to vote in a\ngood slate of PAP MP because of this strategy\n\n\nMr Chiam said ask them to vote the opposition and then what happen\nif they vote the opposition he says that it would be a vote for the\nopposition and it would a vote against the endorsement of Mr Goh Chok Tong\n\n\nHe says this will send conflicting signals but I do not see it at\nall\n\n\nI think Mr Jayakumar has got it all wrong himself\n\n\nThe fact is that since 1984 or maybe earlier the electorate of\nSingapore has seen the harsh policies of the PAP\n\n\nThey have seen how the PAP take money from the people with all\nkinds of means they have got a social problem and they use the social problem\nto get money out of it\n\n\nThey have a social problem of car congestion and they thought in\nfact they have taken advantage of the car congestion and make plenty of money\nout of it you know\n\n\nAnd I know they have got car import tax they have got ARF now we\nhave got COE we got high registration fee we got parking fee all kinds all\nadded up\n\n\nNot only car owners suffer but of course if we are business people\nso the people are quite fed up and they want opposition\n\n\nThis is what the people want they want opposition but because\nopposition for the time being is weak they are not confident\n\n\nThey don't want to vote the opposition into power but they still\nwant the PAP to be the government but they want substantial strong opposition\nto check the PAP and this is the real feedback from the ground\n\n\nIt is not that the people want to vote the PAP actually\n\n\nThey don't want if they can help it\n\n\nIf there is a good slate of opposition they would throw them out of\noffice out of the government if there are but that will be another day for us\n\n\nSo that is the true reading of the ground the people want\nopposition substantial opposition\n\n\nThey want the PAP to be in power and so now we have given what the\npeople want a by-election\n\n\nYou can vote as many opposition as possible and when you vote the\nopposition it is not a conflicting signal\n\n\nThis is the correct signal to the PAP\n\n\nYou have to vote more opposition strong opposition not only to\nestablish opposition in parliament\n\n\nMake opposition part of our political culture not only that but\nalso an effective an effective hammer over the head of PAP\n\n\nIf you don't do that what will happen\n\n\nYou can bet your last dollar after this election prices will sure\nto go up\n\n\nThe PAP now tells you that the issue is Medifund Edusave and\nwhatever but don't believe a word of it\n\n\nYou want to ask them what is behind all these issues that is more\nimportant\n\n\nIt is not the front issues it is what is hidden behind\n\n\nThey haven't told you that is more important because you remember\nin 1988 what were the issues the elected President\n\n\nThey say only to take care of the reserve and then we have got the\ntown council\n\n\nThey said oh if opposition come in the rubbish heap will go two\nstoreys high all untrue\n\n\nThose were the issues but they then did not tell you that in fact\nonce they get elected with a majority strong mandate the other issues are\nhidden behind as price increases\n\n\nMr Ling How Doong our Chairman and candidate at Bukit Gombak now\nyou know what happen after the 1998 election\n\n\nIt was only held in September the 1st about not three years yet you\nknow\n\n\nWhat happened of course immediately after the general election your\nHDB car park from 25 to 50 dollars we have got hefty increases in medical and\nhospitalisation fees\n\n\nSo now you better watch out if you get sick you better make sure\nyou have money in your pocket otherwise you cannot afford to get sick\n\n\nYou can afford to die but you cannot afford to get sick\n\n\nHefty increases in school fees for independent schools hefty\nincreases in university fees\n\n\nThe poor taxi drivers who were always supporters or many of them\nwere supporters were supporters of the PAP have now got to pay 7007 for their\ndiesel tax\n\n\nEverybody is fond of watching TV your TV license also gone up so\nthese are the issues which they dare not tell you\n\n\nYes all sorts of taxes not only PUB tax and in the case of the\nelected President once the law is made not only the power to veto the use of\nreserves but in fact they have got a whole host of other powers\n\n\nIn fact the elected President has so much powers that when he\nreally functions I think the Prime Minister will have a tough time in doing\nwhat he wants to do so that is that that is the thing I think all\nSingaporeans know of today\n\n\nNow what is the main issue in this general election\n\n\nThe main issue is not giving a resounding mandate to Mr Goh Chok\nTong that has got nothing to do with you\n\n\nWhat is important is this general election is whether you want a\nstrong opposition in parliament that is the issue\n\n\nRemember that and as far as SDP is concerned we don't bother about\nwhat Goh CHok Tong wants\n\n\nWe not we are not bothered whether you want a big endorsement\nwhether he wants a strong mandate\n\n\nThat doesn't not concern you\n\n\nHow does it benefit you if he gets a 100% mandate\n\n\nHow does it concern you in fact he will have more power to impose\nmore taxes\n\n\nIt does not benefit the people of Singapore at all\n\n\nThey have already the mandate they have got 41 seats they are in\npower so that question is entirely out\n\n\nYou are not concerned with it at all\n\n\nWhen he talk to you he says that the issue is myself you say you\njust forget it don't worry\n\n\nThe worry the worrying thing is that whether there is strong\nopposition in parliament because it is not only for the long-term interest of\nSingapore but it is directly for your interest directly for your interest\n\n\nThe more opposition you have the less the PAP has power on you it\nis a direct proportion\n\n\nThe more power the PAP has the more they can tax on you\n\n\nThey can do whatever they want in order to get the PAP power down\n\n\nYou must have a balancing power of more opposition and this is a\nvery important message and we want the people of Singapore to understand this\n\n\nWe in the SDP has taken the trouble to reduce our own number of\ncandidates to make sure that we have a by-election effect\n\n\nWhat happen on Nomination Day if there is 41 opposition candidates\nstanding for election and PAP 40 we will take the trouble to ask one of our\nmembers to come back down let them have 41\n\n\nThat is the way how we feel so strongly about our strategy because\nnow you can vote in the opposition member\n\n\nYou want to vote for a long time and that is the true feedback we\nget and today I'm here to support Mr Ashleigh Seow\n\n\nYou cannot get a better candidate in Ulu Pandan than Mr Seow he is\na highly qualified man he has got a B.A. honours degree in public\nadministration from the University of Western Australia\n\n\nHe has travelled widely he has travelled widely in Australia in\nEngland in Europe and he has got a lot of international exposure\n\n\nHe is a mature person and not only that he has got the benefit of\nhands-on experience not only in running a town council but also in setting up\na town council\n\n\nWe in Potong Pasir we have a town council which we run ourselves\n\n\nWe don't neglect our responsibility we do it ourselves all the\nresponsibility we bear on our shoulders\n\n\nWe don't chuck it to some professional managing agent to do it for\nus like other PAP town councils\n\n\nSo Mr Seow has seen the setting up of the Potong Pasir town council\nbefore it was formerly come into operation\n\n\nWe had the ground work laid see that all the paperwork was right we\nhave to engage staff we have to send the staff for training he has to\norganise\n\n\nWell that is how he is only known in Potong Pasir so he is the\nright man for you because at the town council here he will make sure that it\nno only functions well but perhaps functions even better than Potong Pasir\n\n\nAs you know because we did it ourselves we have a lower cost and we\nneed not raise the service and conservancy charges\n\n\nWe did not do it we did it only after 15 months 15 months after the\nHDB first raised their service and conservancy charges\n\n\nWe were able to hold back and 9 months after the 1st PAP town\ncouncil raised their service and conservancy charges\n\n\nSo the issue of the town council now is never brought up by the PAP\nbecause Potong Pasir town council\n\n\nThe performance at Potong Pasir has silenced them once and for all\n\n\nThey cannot go around like the 1988 elections threatening people if\nyou elect an opposition MP he may not be able to run your town council the\nrubbish will heap up to the second floor your corridors are not swept the\nprices of your flats will fall\n\n\nThese are all not true because we have proven it at Potong Pasir if\nyou try to but your flat in Potong Pasir\n\n\nYou probably have to pay more than in any other including but more\nimportantly is not just the cleaning and keep the place clean that is with\nefficiency of service\n\n\nThat is probably the easy part\n\n\nThe most difficult part is how to build it into a community how to\nbuild it into a closely whole and how to get the people at the constituency\nto do things for themselves and be proud that we are the people who are\nreally in charge and not the PAP \n\n\nAnd we show that we don't need the PAP people can do things\nthemselves that is the more important function of the town council and we at\nPotong Pasir may try to do what we preach we have the town council which are\nrepresentatives of the residents there are 4 total or more who are non-SDP\nmembers and therefore our town council unlike the other PAP town councils we\nare not political I am the political representative there anytime can be\noutvoted because they have the majority I am not worried because I know they\nare residents they care for their own town Potong Psir town they care for\ntheir own surroundings they were only to make sure that things are correct\nfor the town so the issue of town council is never brought out again although\nthey say that it is explicitly going to be an issue of this election now I\nthink we have put the PAP on the defensive you can see Goh Chok Tong is\nalready retreating at first he came out very strongly and say unless I get an\nendorsement I may not have the power or the ability to implement Edusave and\nMedisave and the people and opposition gets more firm as the people\nunderstand the strategy of the opposition the people understand that they can\nvote in more opposition this time Goh Chok Tong he's afraid now you can see\nhe report in the papers oh no no even if I get a weak endorsement I will\nstill implement these policies and because of the onslaught of this good\nstrategy he can't think properly for a Prime Minister what is he saying he\nsays that in fact it was stated by BG Lee he said that if the opposition wins\n40 seats possibility is there a possibility of the win of the opposition win\n40 seats then it will be a weak endorsement for the PAP and Goh Chok Tong\ngoes to say that if the opposition wins 40 seats then it would be not an\nendorsement for his leadership and he will step down do you know that Marine\nParade is a contested constituency they have a opposition contesting in\nMarine Parade if the PAP lost 40 seats Goh Chok Tong will have lost his seat\nhe will not be in parliament he will be kicked out he cannot step down he\nwill be kicked out I'm surprised that Mr Goh can make such a mistake not\nrealising that his own Marine Parade is contested a contested seat there it\nis not a question of if it is the PAP lost 40 seats it is not a question of\nnot endorsing his leadership in fact they don't want him even to be a member\nof parliament now my last duty here is to appeal to all of you residents here\nat Ulu Pandan if you are staying in these flats please tell your neighbours\nwho are not here your relatives your friends your colleagues at your\nwork-places if you go to the market the store-holders the shopkeepers tell\nthem all tell them all that this is a by that there is a by-election effect\ntell them all to vote in credible opposition wherever you see one you vote\nthem in and please tell them to vote in the SDP candidate he is a credible\nopposition give him a chance to show that he can do better than the PAP\ncandidate all the time the PAP claim that they are the only good ones but\nbecause the opposition has never given a chance now is the chance for you to\nvote Mr Ashleigh Seow as your next member of parliament vote in Ashleigh Seow\nmake him your next member of parliament I'm very proud to present Ashleigh\nSeow to you and I am sure he will make a very good member of parliament you\ncan see for yourself he is a very sincere man approachable person anytime you\ngot any problem you just give him a ring and he will come running to you can\nyou say that of any PAP member of parliament well i suppose Ashleigh Seow is\ntoo big for him to kiss i'm a smaller person yes i appeal to you I urge you\nplease vote in Ashleigh Seow we have got one member of the opposition in\nparliament let us see many many more new faces and when you turn on the TV\nparliament tonight you will definitely find it more interesting

{"text": "<$A> \n\nDear friends and residents of Ulu Pandan\n\n\nThe Peoples' Action Party is very fond of introducing candidates\nwith high paper qualifications\n\n\nThey will introduce doctors architects and engineers and\nwhat-have-you but they have failed to realise one very important thing\n\n\nNot everyone with a high qualification can be a good politician\nsimply because it is not only the paper qualification that make you a good\npolitician\n\n\nThe pre-requisite of a good politician is one who is responsible to\nhis own conscience and we adopt our system from England\n\n\nNow in England members of parliament would vote against their own\nparty if it is against their conscience but not in Singapore\n\n\nIn Singapore I will tell you one thing\n\n\nNo matter how qualified they are they are considered political\ncripple they are political handicap\n\n\nNow what is the use of you standing a GP candidate of parliament\nwhen he cannot do your bidding\n\n\nThey are supposed to be your representative but in parliament they\nrepresent the Peoples' Action Party not you\n\n\nTherefore you must always consider this factor when you vote for\nmember of parliament\n\n\nYou won't the only people that can effectively be members of the\nopposition in parliament would be the opposition himself\n\n\nThe Peoples' Action Party has declared their manifesto and the next\nlap\n\n\nNow to give you in order to give you some insight of what is in\nstore for you in the next lap let us consider the vision and PAP has told you\nin 1984 election the vision of 1999\n\n\nNow they are they are saying that we are going the next lap\n\n\nWhat have they done so far that affect the life of the middle and\nthe lower income group in the past\n\n\nSince 1988 you have seen the government imposing tax taxes fees\nlevies at a short interval of a few months\n\n\nYou will note you have noticed the car park fees have gone up\ntelevision fees have gone up taxi diesel tax have gone up car prices of\nmotorcar has gone up diesel petrol has gone up and HDB flat has gone up the\nlist goes on\n\n\nI don't have to tell you I'm quite sure you know what they are now\nhaving known the power of the PAP you will know what is in store for all of\nyou in the next lap\n\n\nThe People's Action Party has already passed a law in parliament to\nimpose consumption tax on all of you\n\n\nThey need only to gazette the item in order to put them in practice\nare you aware of consumption tax\n\n\nThe consumption tax will the tax on the daily necessities of what\nyou and I would use shoes clothings food drinks everything under the sun\n\n\nThey will I would I can assure you if you give them more than the\n41 seats in parliament it would be considered as an endorsement for them to\ncarry out this\n\n\nIn other words they would really introduce consumption tax sooner\nthan expected\n\n\nYou see the when we critisises the government for increasing the\nhospital fees medical charges the fees for education they came up with the\nidea of Edusave and Medifund\n\n\nMind you they have not given any details of what will be the\nEdusave or the Medifund\n\n\nWe do not know it came out it sprang a surprise by telling you that\nthey will look into these things\n\n\nMy answer is a simple one don't tell us Edusave don't tell us\nMedifund reduce the charges of more hospital fees and ward charges reduce the\nfees for independent schools and for the university\n\n\nI have said it last night and for the benefit of those who have not\nhear me I will tell you again and you tell me whether it is a fact that the\ngovernment has subsidised us in respect of medical charges or ward charges\n\n\nVery simple one I am sure everyone of you here is aware of this now\nwhen you have a cold or flu or cough you go to a private clinic here you see\na doctor here how much you pay for the visit 10 to 14 dollars you agree with\nme\n\n\nYou go to Singapore General Hospital you go and see a doctor there\nhow much would you pay consultation is 12 dollars with medicine is about 15\ndollars almost the same\n\n\nWhere is the subsidy where is the subsidy you tell me first\n\n\nI want to find out where is the subsidy\n\n\nAre you telling me the private clinic are also subsidising us also\nand for the ward charges let me tell you\n\n\nI have checked with the private hospitals here they are providing a\nthree-bedding ward with air-con colour television and private telephone and\nthey are charging 145 dollars a day and you know how much they are charging\nat the Singapore General Hospital\n\n\nI won't talk of the who is charging 220 dollars the Singapore\nGeneral Hospital is charging you 140 dollars and with something added in 175\ndollars\n\n\nNo air-con no colour television where is the subsidy where is the\nsudsidy you tell me first\n\n\nUnless the private hospitals are also subsidising us and mind you\nthe private hospital can charge us 145 dollars a day I think they must have\nmade 20 dollars\n\n\nIn other words their basic cost is only 70 dollars and you must\nalways remember this factor a private hospital is put up with a tremendous\ninvestment by individual who would suffer loss if the hospital has no\nbuisness\n\n\nThey would have gone bankrupt and they are charging us a cost of 70\ndollars\n\n\nWhat about the general hospital and the Kandang hospital who build\nthe hospital who fund all from our money taxpayers' money\n\n\nTherefore if a private hospital can charge us 145 dollars the\ngovernment should charge us 40 dollars because private hospitals' cost is\nonly 70 dollars and if government charge us 10 70 dollars 40 dollars they\ndon't subsidise us much because hospital has been paid for by our taxpayer\nmoney\n\n\nYou ask your MP whether they can answer me\n\n\nIt's simple simple arithmetic we don't need to go to the university\nto acquire you know a degree in Mathematics\n\n\nSimple arithmetic you get the answer\n\n\nWhere is the subsidy absolutely none and the government is telling\nall this while they are being subsidising us\n\n\nThis is the type of government we have\n\n\nThey tell us a lot of things they juggle the figures and that's it\nand one more factor you must always remember\n\n\nSingapore is only interested in the intellectuals those people of\nintelligience not merely graduate they want the best of the graduate the\nPresident's scholars they are only treated with respect\n\n\nThe rest of the rest of all of us here who are not President's\nscholars are considered in the eyes of digits\n\n\nWe are digits this is what happen in Singapore and you must when\nyou cast your vote always remember this how shabbily all of us have been\ntreated all the middle and the income group have been treated\n\n\nIt is easy for the minister to increase the fees because the Prime\nMinister is being 49000 dollars a month and the ministers are being paid\n31000 dollars a month who has been in Singapore between 400 and 450 thousand\npeople earning 1000 dollars a month\n\n\nThis is the difference in the pay of the ministers getting and the\npeople getting here you know\n\n\nThey have been telling people oh people in the private sector are\ngetting much more than in the government service then resign go into private\npractice nobody is forcing you to be in the government service\n\n\nIf you want to be in politics you must always remember one thing in\npolitics it is always sacrifice and more sacrifice and you must remember they\nahve increased their salary and pay once\n\n\nThere is nothing to stop them to increase their salary again\nbecause there is no control over how much they can get\n\n\nIf they like it they just increase the pay and you must also\nremember half the workers in Singapore is getting only 800 dollars a month\nafter CPF deduction the take-home pay is a poor thing 650 dollars a month\n\n\nCan you afford to send your children to independent school charging\na fee of 200 dollars a month\n\n\nCan you afford to send your children to the university take up\nmedicine or dentistry paying 10800 dollars a month\n\n\nThis is the government that really look after you these are all\nfacts and figures let me sound a ward of a word of warning for all of you\n\n\nIf the PAP on the 31st of August take the other 30 seats don't say\n40 seats get another 30 seats it is considered as an endorsement for what\nthey have done because they have done exactly that in the past\n\n\nThey say there you are you know the elected President we said you\nmust hold a referendum they say no need to hold a referendum because at the\nlast election opposition has been talking of an elected President and you\nhave voted us in you have\n\n\nIn other words indirectly endorsed the elected President so they\nwill be adopting the same stance when you come the next general election\n\n\nTherefore because they are always going on what your votes they use\nyour votes as an yardstick to measure whether you endorse their policy or not\n\n\nAnd you know I I'm really surprised it really shows how desperate\nthe PAP leadership is\n\n\nNow they they have told us in the past before the introduction of\nthe bill in parliament of elected President they say we want the elected\nPresident to prevent opposition from squandering away the national reserves\n\n\nThey said national reserves are meant for emergency now\n\n\nYou have just heard Mr Goh Chok Tong telling us he's going to use\nthe national reserves for Edusave and Medifund\n\n\nWhere is the emergency is there any emergency this is the double\nstandard we get from the PAP leadership when they use the money\n\n\nNo need emergency when they use the money they are not squandering\naway the money but when we use the money they say we are trying to squander\naway the money\n\n\nIt takes a bigger thief to catch a thief you know\n\n\nYou they must have thought that they themselves are capable of it\nthat is why they think we are capable of doing that we opposition are a\ndifferent category of men and remember in parliament\n\n\nSo far you know I look at parliament seating now it's a melodrama\nit's a melodrama because you find the member of parliament of the Peoples'\nAction Party full of sound and fury signifying nothing and have you seen a\nmember of parliament vote against any motion in parliament\n\n\nThey make a lot of noise wasting public fund wasting our time\nwasting the television time for what for nothing for nothing\n\n\nIf you want genuine opposition in parliament only opposition party\ncan provide and we have put up a credible slate of candidates nine of us\n\n\nPut us in we will show you what real opposition is about we will be\nyour voice\n\n\nLet me tell you this if Lim Boon Heng were I will vote against the\ngovernment and represent the people I will step down I will support him ask\nhim to think about that\n\n\nI will be prepared to step down it is impossible\n\n\nTherefore you people must always remember this when you go to the\npoll on the 31st of August because it involves your future it involves your\nchildren's future\n\n\nI know most of you here are very comfortable you have got a house\nyou have a roof over your head you have got a car you can go on holiday every\nmonth but please your children may not be as successful as you are\n\n\nYour children may a tertiary education but by then the competition\nwill be so keen they may not do as well as you are \n\n\nYou must be able you must do one thing and you must be able to\nlook into children'eye and say I have done my best people know in Singapore\nwe have been doing 200 persons suffering of kidney ailment very month every\nyear they are without help and you must remember kidney ailment we do not\nknow the cause neither can we prevent it but anyone of us here who get it and\ndon't say oh I'm healthy now but once you get it it is going to be a triple\nblow to your whole family and your children may get it we must fight for\nthese poor people they get this disease through no fault of theirs they get\nkidney ailment not because they drink not because they smoke not because you\nknow they do things and hurt their own health no such thing people have got\nno heart this is your opportunity if you want your voice to be heard if you\nwant the PAP to respect you they are coming to you now shedding crocodile\ntears begging for you to put them give them a full mandate but mind you once\nyou do that you will have to suffer another 5 years and by then it 's not\ngoing to be the next lap it will be your collapse thank you", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6632cde7-a629-4e0d-96c0-3ddbc56e2f6d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.640177+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nUh uh thank you Susan\n\n\nCan you hear me\n\n\nOh dear I my\n\n\nFirst of all a level of apology\n\n\nI held everybody up the tra traffic was really heavy along the way\n\n\nUhm my first uh and initial and at a journalist gut responses say it\ndoesn't help and we don't want a standard Singapore a dictionary of standard\nSingapore English\n\n\nI say this because uhm I have a I've got a very big title for a very\ndifficult job in the newspaper and basically I was brought in there to deal\nwith all the language problems that the editors could not handle and didn't\nhave the time to handle and didn't want to handle which is why uh reporters\nespecially young reporters always making grammatical mistakes\n\n\nAnd in the newsroom everything goes under the label of grammatical\nwhether it's lexical whether it's anything else at all it's grammatical\n\n\nSo uh I'm there some kind of arbiter telling people that this is\nokay that's not okay and uh this ought to be better etcetra etcetra\n\n\nSo in a way I'm a setter of standards but I feel very uhm uncertain\nabout my role very ambivalent cos' on the one hand uh you've got a scholl of\nthought there which says that it's got to be very standard which by very\nstandard they mean British English\n\n\nFor example we have an editor or they think they they they they\nthink what they want is no they want what they think is British English which\nmay not be standard British English\n\n\nWe have an editor who is uh quite old fashioned who is very good\nwriter who is a lover of the word and uhm who also objects to things like\nmeet with who objects recently who objected recently to the use of pants\n\n\nUhm I don't know what sort of context I've to find that out because\nthat was a very recent sort of message sent down to the newsroom\n\n\nAnd then on the other hand we have to look at the purpose of a\nnewspaper uhm the function because the newspaper is a medium of communication\nbetween the the newsmaker whoever he is government politician or or or a big\nbusinessman and the reader\n\n\nAnd it's a it's I see it because I come from education as an\nexercise of nation-building\n\n\nYou try to communicate with your readers you try to build up\nconsensus or or you try to not to build up consensus\n\n\nYou want to you want to encourage discussion or not necessarily\ndissent but discussion at least and you want to make a the your reader aware\nof your environment\n\n\nSo we look at the news The Straits Times\n\n\nThere's it's like Singapore in uhm in forty pages you know\n\n\nYou've the hard news the page one news where all the important news\nfrom around the world and locally you know is reflected in The Straits Times\n\n\nYou've got the back page where all the big news about what's\nhappening in the money world is reflected in the back page\n\n\nAnd then you've a section which is rather softer and with a bit of\nuh they've book reviews\n\n\nThere are features that are of human interest then you've the\npolitical analysis page you've got the editorial page you've got the forum\npage where readers write in to tell you what they think they like what they\ndon't like etcetera\n\n\nThen you've got a community page which is in the section called\nLife uh which deals with uh particularly Singaporean problems\n\n\nIt used to be a bilingual section but it's now called community so\nwe deal with social problems we deal with all kinds of problems\n\n\nAnd then there's a what do you call the news uhm home news which is\nall the accidents uh list of divorces but that's out now but accidents\nrobbery burglary uhm foul-ups on the highway all that gets in as well as all\nthe campaigns and etcetera whatever\n\n\nSo that's a newspaper so it's Singapore in forty pages\n\n\nNow uhm so obviously it's not possible to say we want to reflect\nwhat we think is standard British because I think that's a crazy notion\n\n\nSo what do I do I've spent ten years there and I've spent the\nbetter part of five years trying to reconcile in my own mind what my job is\nand I decided that the most important thing is to say we want a bit of this\nand a bit of that\n\n\nBut we've got to be guided by certain basic principles and the\nbasic principle I have thought out is uh the context\n\n\nThe context is a guiding concept which is if you see it as a\ntriangle uhm it's going to be the message or the story the content\n\n\nWhat is the purpose of this story that you're telling\n\n\nIf it's an editorial you want to persuade somebody to believe\nsomething then your message is I want to persuade Singaporeans to believe\nthat a is b or a is not b\n\n\nIf it's a news report then I want to just tell this bit of news\nthere was an accident at whatever place at whatever time and so many people\nwere hurt uhm\n\n\nIf it is entertainment I want to entertain so that's your story or\nmessage at the top of this triangle\n\n\nNow of course at one end you're going to have the reader or writer\nsorry reader or hearer\n\n\nAnd in the newspaper context it's always reader because we've\nwritten we're a written communication so it's a reader\n\n\nWhat kind of reader he is he is\n\n\nHas he got 'O' levels is he uhm is he part of the elite\n\n\nWhoever these people are the in is he an intellectual is he a\nbusinessman housewife retiree young school student 'A' level\n\n\nWhatever what is he looking for when he turns to your story then\nthe other end you've got the writer\n\n\nThe writer has got her innate capacity facility with language love\nof the word or somebody who knows the facts but doesn't know the language\nvery well and she has to have a style of her own\n\n\nAnd these these I wish I have a there is a wall id uhm if I'm\ntaking too long just stop me you know because we're used to newspaper to\nchopping and chopping everything you know whenever time is up\n\n\nSo I'm used to that another five minutes so in this is the writer\n\n\nSo depending on on what these variables are the language gets\nselected\n\n\nIt's always come some sound selection as they write they begin to\nknow what what words to to to to what words to use what words are can be\nallowed and what cannot be allowed\n\n\nFor example some of the words that Rosemary uh gave us that\nbeautiful long list\n\n\nI didn't know I've been a friend of hers for twenty years\n\n\nI didn't know that she was compiling this marvellous thing uhm\n\n\nWhat was it like what did she have like the word shiok for example\nyou know the word those of you who are Singaporeans oh I'm sorry ya can you\ncan you hear me now\n\n\nYes I was going on about the word shiok you know I think all\nSingaporeans here know exactly what it means\n\n\nI don't know whether Jonathan knows\n\n\nDo you know\n\n\nOh it haven't well can somebody explain to him\n\n\nIt's it's like delicious marvellous great the word shiok yeh\n\n\n\n\n\nNot shok but you know but but is that how it's pronounced\n\n\nShirley you must help me out on this\n\n\n\n\n\nOh okay look at another word uhm okay look at the word amok\n\n\nYou know the word amuck is spelt amuck\n\n\nIs that how you spell or amok amok\n\n\nRight now very we're very fond of this word cos' I think it's a\nbeautiful word\n\n\nIf a man runs wild with a parang or with a revolver whatever and\nshoots twenty people and he's absolutely crazy uhm you can't call him a wild\nman you can't call him a mad man\n\n\nAll these do not convey that's that situation you know\n\n\nAnd I think the word amuck does now\n\n\nUhm how would the writer know whether that's useable or not\n\n\nI think they would immediately reach for word for that word because\nit's so colourful and it communicates to the Singaporean exactly uh what he\nwants to convey but uhm they have some problems with that word which I think\nSu Susan will later on come to talk about\n\n\nYap now uhm maybe think of another word uhm let me give you an\neasier example\n\n\nYou know the word kids K-I-D-S\n\n\nI know it's frowned on by some people for example uh the eminent\nsir what his name now\n\n\nQuirk Ronald Quirk uhm Randolph Sir Randolph Quirk yap uhm we used\nto have a page called kids and things and I used I used to have to deal with\nuh problems like this\n\n\nWe had people uhm sub-editors from the Times of London and so who\nwere working in the newsroom\n\n\nWhen I appeared on the scene they say look let's get together and\nban this word kids I said I'm not here in the process of banning anything or\nlegislating or laying down the law\n\n\nUhm we have to get together to learn to use the English language in\na way that is acceptable to ourselves and to others and the objection was\nkids means baby goats\n\n\nNow you know that's a very old fashioned and very restricted\nmeaning of the word kids\n\n\nI don't know whether you will agree now uhm so we had this problem\nof the the word little a little corner of a page for children\n\n\nIt's called kids and things you know those little crossword puzzles\nthey can do things they can make and so on\n\n\nNow what do you do with that\n\n\nDo you say the word kids is non-standard and therefore you know you\nwant the paper to write good English or to reflect good English so out with\nthe word kids\n\n\nWhat do you put in its place children and things\n\n\nYou destroy the whole corner that that page but if we had the\nheadline like uhm Ministry of Education to test two thousand school children\n\n\nThat's a headline for a very formal story which is based on a on a\npress release sent out by the Minister of Education\n\n\nDo you then say Ministry of Education to test two thousand school\nkids\n\n\nNo because you know uh you spoil the style of it the tone the the\nthe the style is supposed the best the better word the best word of that\nheadline in that story so it's your one minute here that's just enough for me\nto fix this\n\n\n\n\n\nSo you you go back to this concept and you use this to select your\nlanguage\n\n\nIf your story is very formal it should be formal the purpose of\nyour story <unclear> word </unclear> Singpaoreanisms\n\n\nSo how can you not have words like shiok and alamak and so on in it\nbecause it's part of the story\n\n\nIf your reader your reader is a young Singaporean you better have a\nvoice that he can relate to\n\n\nIf your writer is not capable of doing humour then don't try to do\na piece of on Singaporeanisms\n\n\nThat's basically uh to answer your question just two\n\n\nNow so uh although my gut feeling is to say that we don't want a\ndictionary of Singapore English because I don't think my editors will approve\n\n\nAlthough they gave me permission to be here not knowing what I'm\ngoing to do here\n\n\nI think we the thing that they can live I can live with in the\ncontext of my work there is to say that in a way the newspaper is trying not\nto prescribe but to to test the limits of what's possible in terms of uh\nvariations from standard which people have in their minds and therefore a\ndictionary of Singapore English is the other side of the coin \n\n\nWe both help to compile that because fr' not forgetting we are\nSingapore in forty pages we we try we help to compile that and so most of the\nexamples came from The Straits Times and at the same time when that tome is\ncompiled we are the people who can in some ways best demonstrate the use of\nuhm these words in the dictionary because we are not restricted to like for\nexample Simon is talking about creative writing literature and someone else\ntalking about uhm something else but we have everything in the newspaper we\nare sort of to some extent specialist and in many ways generalist we have\neverything in the newspaper in forty pages so I don't know whether that\nanswers the question thank you", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "84cdc57d-4456-4443-a7c7-1c3119e3ef3b", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nNow good afternoon to all of you President of the Arts Club and\nArts Club committee members colleagues the Deanery and freshmen and friends\n\n\nWell I should very fresh people because we mustn't be too gender you\nknow specific\n\n\nWell you have come really to the largest faculty of course the the\nPresident of the Arts Club has said that that the faculty is second to none\nbut we can claim to be certainly the largest faculty on this campus with\nsomething like four thousand four hundred students uh three hundred and forty\nacademic staff another ninety to hundred uh non-academic staff\n\n\nSo we really are a very large faculty certainly the largest in terms\nof students\n\n\nAnd student welfare student education training is our business\n\n\nSo we are again welcoming you to this uh Faculty of the University\n\n\nI know that uh you've been exposed to a number of welcomes already\nbut never mind this is the month of of when you're just uh coming in and\nyou're most welcome\n\n\nNow I'll like to just also say that the Deanery reflects the Faculty\nas a whole\n\n\nEven among my colleagues I'm from the History Department the\nVice-Deans are from Geography and Political Science the Sub-Deans from\nEconomics and Statistics and from Social Work and Psychology\n\n\nSo we represent already five departments and several subjects\nbecause you can see that some of the departments are double-barrel\ndepartments with a couple of subjects\n\n\nNow we have act actually eleven departments now we have twelve but\nMass Com became a programme\n\n\nThe Department of Mass Com was transferred to the second university\n\n\nBut we continue with the Mass Communication Programme in this\nfaculty\n\n\nSo we've got eleven departments and we've got four Faculty\nProgrammes together with a new programme being offered by the Department of\nEnglish Language and Literature namely Theatre Studies\n\n\nSo things are happening\n\n\nWe have not just a large faculty but a faculty which comes with a\nlot of intellectual activity a lot of interesting activity\n\n\nNow we're an arts faculty so remember this we want to cultivate not\nsimply uh personality but really the artistic sides of your personality\n\n\nAnd this is something we want to develop not just giving\ninformation but to encourage the imagination\n\n\nThis is what art is about\n\n\nBut more than that we are also a faculty of arts and social\nsciences\n\n\nSo there's that element of really seeking to be a bit more\nscientific about things\n\n\nAlthough it's social science there's that element in it trying to\nuh be more precise to use more quantitative methods and not just using\nimagination\n\n\nSo we want to anchor it in more specific uh inquiries\n\n\nUh this is not to say that the humanities are you know rather\nfree-floating and the science the social sciences are rather hard\n\n\nNo there's a blend of it but in your first year you're doing three\nsubjects\n\n\nSo you have a chance to uh combine arts and social sciences if you\nwish and not only also uh this kind of combination but remember combine\ncombining certain subjects with programmes which are multi-disciplinary\n\n\nI'm talking about European Studies South-East Asian Studies\nLinguistics which are supposed to be multi- and even inter-disciplinary\n\n\nAnd in the case of the Studies Programmes and the Studies\nDepartments remember that also that element of language which you are able to\npick up\n\n\nSo we are really very proud and very happy that we have an\nopportunity opportunity to offer you such a variety of riches uh in terms of\nintellectual activity and stimuli\n\n\nNow of course you'll be very uh still finding your feet I mean\nsubjects actually but be assured that most students are able to get some of\ntheir top choices\n\n\nMost of them most of you so be encouraged\n\n\nHowever if you do have difficulties do try to be a bit uh\nadventurous a bit more adaptable and be prepared to make a few little changes\nuh in your thinking so that you can uh maybe pick up something which is new\n\n\nAnd from our little research we found that don't worry those who\neven were given you know subjects which didn't really feature in their first\nthree choices managed to do well enough\n\n\nAnd very few of those who have to do supplementaries and fail\nreally were those who you know just couldn't cope with the subjects they're\ngiven\n\n\nSo there's no real correlation uh between those who had their first\nchoices and doing extremely well in them or those who did not get their\nchoices and doing badly in them so be encouraged\n\n\nBut if you have problems we have uh the department uh to give\nadvice as well as members of the Deanery especially the Vice-Dean Dr Lee Boon\nHiok and also our our our Faculty Associate Mrs Ann Wee\n\n\nThey're here to really advise you to help you\n\n\nI always say that the Vice-Dean is not a terrible person unlike the\ndedication <unclear> word </unclear> / designation <unclear> word </unclear>\n/ delegation <unclear> word </unclear> 'Vice-Dean' you know who's out to to\nlook out for vices and or something like that\n\n\nNo nothing like that\n\n\nThe Vice-Dean is and and the Vice-Deans in fact are both\nAd-Vice-Deans\n\n\nThey give good advice uh on certain matters and both of them are\nvery intimately involved in helping student matters in in student matters\n\n\nNot not just one\n\n\nProfessor Lee Boon Hiok give uh more you know advice about course\nenrolments and combinations and so on but uh Dr Victor Savage is our Liaison\nwith the Arts Club and Societies and he tells me to give a little bit of\nencouragement to you all\n\n\nOf course you are practially ipso facto members of the Arts Club\nbut be encouraged also to join uh some societies uh the ones which you feel\ncan be of most help uh to you\n\n\nBut also be a bit adventurous\n\n\nJoin other societies even if you're not reading a particular\nsubject\n\n\nSo you get a wider exposure to the range with we offer in our\nfaculty\n\n\nWell these are just some words of encouragement at this stage\nbecause you will hear a lot of things being said a lot of information that\nyou might even get uh intellectual con constipation of some sort\n\n\nTerrible you know just can't digest all these things\n\n\nBut try to take stock try to pause at times reflect and don't let\nuh it become systems-overload and all the alarm bells start ringing\n\n\nDon't worry just try to uh pause at times take stock of what uh is\nbeing offered\n\n\nDon't just consult seniors but also attend lectures for yourselves\nto see what the courses are about before you try to make your choices such\nchoices as you have\n\n\nBut nonetheless be encouraged at this time\n\n\nDon't be you know despondent because there're always people who are\naround who can help you\n\n\nWell on that note I again warmly welcome you to the faculty on\nbehalf of my colleagues and I wish you every success in your time with us\n\n\nThank you \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nGood evening Faculty colleagues friends from the\nadministration and the library and other university officers and students\nespecially the first year's prize winners and ladies and gentlemen\n\n\nNow before I give you a short uh address I'd like to introduce\ncolleagues in the Deanery and the Heads of Department to you\n\n\nSo as I call I hope they will stand so you can see them and then\nwe'll uh you can greet them in your usual especially if you're from their\ndepartment\n\n\nWell first suh my colleagues in the Deanery the two Vice-Deans\nAssociate Professor Lee Boon Hiok and Dr Victor Savage the Sub-Deans Dr\nEuston Quah and Dr Low Peng Hong Mrs Ann Wee Faculty Associate Mrs Mary-Ann\nLeo Administrative Officer and Ms Sheila Menon Administrative Assistant\n\n\nNow you'll have to keep on swerving your head left and right\nbecause I'll be introducing colleagues on both sides\n\n\nSo first uh I like to introduce Heads of Department Professor Tham\nSiong Chee Malay Studies\n\n\nProfessor Ong Jin Hui head of Sociology and also Director of\nFaculty Centre of Advanced Studies\n\n\nAssociate Professor Teo Siew Eng Head of Geography\n\n\nAssociate Professor Edwin Lee Head of History\n\n\nAssociate Professor <unclear> word </unclear> <unclear> word\n</unclear> Head of Economics and Statistics Associate Associate\n\n\nProfessor Tan Lee Chor Acting Head of Chinese Studies and then on\nthis side I like to at the centre there is Associate Professor or rather\nProfessor Eddie Kuo Director of Mass Communication Programme\n\n\nAssociate Professor John Quah Head of Political Science\n\n\nProfessor Quah is also the Co-ordinator of the European Studies\nProgramme\n\n\nAssociate Professor Chia Chia Chee Meow Head of Japanese Studies\n\n\nDr Vasoo Head of Social Work and Psychology\n\n\nDr Ban Kah Choon Acting Head of English Language and Literature\n\n\nA lot of <unclear> word </unclear> supporters up there\n\n\nThen Dr Chong Kim Chong Acting Head of Philosophy\n\n\nAssociate Professor Mohanan Coordinator of Linguistics Programme\nand last but certainly not least uh we've also got uh the Head of the English\nLanguage Proficiency Unit here Professor Lee Kok Cheong\n\n\nWe also have quite a number of special guests in the audience but I\nI'm afraid I can't introduce all of them\n\n\nThere's so many of them but certainly they're very important people\nin the administration whom you should also meet during the tea\n\n\nWe're very happy that they are represented here\n\n\nNow I'll like to just say a short word of this tea and why we've\norganized it\n\n\nWell this is intended of course mainly for newcomers although\nsometimes we have gatecrashers from the other years because they've they've\ncome to know what the tea is about\n\n\nIt's a welcome tea especially for freshers but we also welcome old\nfriends and we also have invited first year lecturers and visiting professors\nto join us\n\n\nSo you see some people who are <unclear> word </unclear> here only\nfor one year as well as those who teach the first years uh meeting us in this\ntea\n\n\nThis is a good meeting point because in Singaporean style it's a\neating point\n\n\nWhere there're eats there're also meets\n\n\nNow we also want to use this opportunity to honour to recognise to\nhonour our prize winners our students who have well in their studies as well\nas society and club people who have helped in student life\n\n\nSo this is an opportunity to just say Thank you a very big Thank\nyou to them\n\n\nNow in this connection I want to associate myself with the Arts\nClub President in congratulating the Club and those who were particularly\ninvolved in the making of the Faculty float which as Lincoln reminded you won\na silver medal in the competition yes yesterday\n\n\nSo thanks again Arts Club and all the helpers who made the float\n\n\nI'll like also uh on this very first occasion when I address all of\nyou together to mention that we have introduced two new programmes this year\n\n\nOne is an undergraduate programme and that is the Art the Theatre\nStudies Programme which is offered by the Department of English Language and\nLiterature for the first time and we want to congratulate the department for\ndoing so and to welcome all those of you who are registered for Theatre\nStudies\n\n\nAnd then the second programme is a postgraduate programme and that\nis the Masters in Public Policy which is managed by the Centre of Advanced\nStudies and under its Director Professor Ong Jin Hui\n\n\nThis is a again a first for our Faculty and we've very much uh\nlooked forward to welcoming people from not only Singapore but people from\nthe ASEAN countries\n\n\nThey've come to join us and even beyond from Mexico\n\n\nSo we're very happy for the Faculty that we have this programme\nrunning for the first time this this session\n\n\nI'd like also to make little comments about Mass Communication\n\n\nAgain I think that many of you if not most are aware that while\nMass Communication has been transformed from a department to a programme \n\n\nThis is because it was felt that uh for the sake of not dividing\nresources between the two universities it should should be more or less\ncentralized in the Nanyang Technological Tech Technological University\nNonetheless we have uh obligation to our students in Mass Communication so\nlast year and again for this year we've taken in a first year intake for Mass\nCommunication so it's not not not it's no longer a department it is a very\nvibrant programme of the Faculty and uh Director of the Programme Professor\nEddie Kuo is simultaneously Dean of the School of Communication Studies NTU\nwhich will receive it's first intake next year So this is just to explain the\nlittle change but nonetheless we are very much assured the students are\nassured that things will go on as usual You will graduate with NUS degrees So\nwe're very happy that this will not really affect resources being/been given\nto the Mass Communication students and staff So I thought this would be\nimportant to explain Now a word to the freshies a special word Now we want\nwant to congratulate those who have made it because for everyone who has been\naccepted into the two universities four or five have been turned away So\nthose of you who have come in you're very fortunate and we want to warmly\nwelcome and congratulate you on coming into NUS and to our Faculty We also\nwould like to say that it's a bit be bewildering to be a member a student in\nthe Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences because there are eleven departments\nand four Faculty Programmes one Department Programme and so on and so many\nother subjects which have been offered including an import of Mathematics\nfrom the Science Faculty But I'll like to assure you that we have a\nembarrassment of riches not of poverty to contend with Now you may not always\nhave the subjects of your choice but we'll try and give you uh perhaps your\nfirst choice at least of two or three of your choices as far as possible but\nat this stage I want to counsel a little bit of flexibility on your part\nPlease don't be too disappointed if you don't get all the three subjects of\nyour choice But we'll try our best to accomodate uh you in at least uh your\nyour top two choices So this is just a word to all of you because in trying\nto be fair to some we might be unfair to so many others So I trust you'll\nunderstand our constraints and on your part exercise a little bit of uh\nflexibility and adaptability as you come in for the first year But\nnonetheless may I in advance wish you every success in your studies and your\nECA uh on this campus Now in conclusion I'll like to thank especially the\nFaculty's Social Committee and the Arts Club people who've helped in\norganizing this welcome tea and now what else remains We're going to eat soon\nbut there remains also to give out the prizes and I want to in in advance\ncongratulate all of the prize winners and those who have contributed to the\nFaculty and then after that of course we can all have tea together Thank you", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "8e08ff15-8369-4275-b035-b02f494a1d98",

{"text": "<$A> \n\nFriends it's very difficult to come in at the tail end of this\ndistinguished company not least because like uh John Silkin\n\n\nUhm I also found the the type of forum rather rather daunting\ndauntingly bored but uhm I'll do my best like Mr Silkin and ramble on for\nfive or ten minutes and then perhaps we can go along with some questions if\nyou have questions for any of us\n\n\nUhm I haven't brought with me my books otherwise we'll read\nsomething from that that will take up five minutes\n\n\nBut uhm what I'll do instead is is just present one or two thoughts\non this type of creativity and genre uhm most have difficulty with that word\nactually pronouncing it the second word whether or not I'm pronouncing it\ncorrectly now\n\n\nUhm the the first thing I think that confronts an Asian writer\nanyway uhm is something more fundamental than than genre and something which\nMr Lee has mentioned uh which is really the issue of language\n\n\nWhat language does one write in to start with\n\n\nUhm for me I never had any choice because my own writing <unclear>\nword </unclear> uhm and I think for many Singaporeans many young Singaporean\nwriters that's really the case now because of the young Singaporeans are\nwriting in English\n\n\nUhm I personally don't feel that is something we should be\nembarrassed or ashamed about and and uh I I certainly sympathise with Mr Lee\nand uh with you know uhm it's an awkward position that he's taken\n\n\nBut nonetheless writing in the language other than uhm one's uh\none's ancestral tongue from my father's side my ancestral tongue is Tamil uh\nand I regret to say I I wasn't able to understand Mr Ramisamy's poems my own\ninadequacies\n\n\nUhm but I think that one of the things which one has to consider is\nthat writing in in English Language there is the question of of genre in\nwhich you of of of of the traditions from which you want to borrow\n\n\nUhm I think it's exciting to to to to hear uh what Mr Ha Professor\nHasmiah's his poems which attempt to use the Persian or Urdu form of bizarre\nand transpose that to the English Language\n\n\nUhm I think that's something which which Singaporean writers had to\nbe concerned about uhm the because when one writes in English as a\nSingaporean in a way one can face a situation where one's writing is very\nthin because we don't we seem to have lost our history by writing in this\nother language\n\n\nUhm and we have to I think consciously strive perhaps more\nconsciously than people who are writing in within a a fixed tradition\n\n\nWe have to strive more consciously to pull hang on to some of those\nthose those tradition to build up our own resource\n\n\nAnd I think one of the great things done in Singapore is that uh\nwe're not although we may be cut off in one sense from an ancestral tradition\nthe fact is that when we cut off from many ancestral traditions so we can\nborrow from all of those ancestral traditions\n\n\nAnd so in a way hopefully perhaps through these pieces of project\nof mine or and of others both a language built on literature which is strong\nbecause it can draw from all these many sources and not be ashamed about\ndoing so\n\n\nAnd perhaps I I I could just mention one or two ways in which I've\nbeen trying to do this\n\n\nUhm first of all my my first book First Loves doesn't fall within\nany genre that I know of\n\n\nI I have been confronted from time to time by academics uh asking\nme you know well what are you trying do and where does this structure from\n\n\nUhm frankly I I I don't know uhm it's uh the the book really\nconsist in short stories about a group of friends growing up but uhm the the\nthe stories are structured in a particular way uhm and nestled within this\nwithin a structure are stories written from other people's viewpoints\n\n\nUhm really I never thought about the structure before starting to\nwrite or to go through naturally other with a curiosity to find out more\nabout the characters and so worked through it write other stories\n\n\nUhm and I think in a way genre of course is is something which\ncritics abet to give themselves here something to do to comment say\n\n\nAh these are the conventions of this genre these are the\nconventions of that genre\n\n\nUhm but of course it's still useful as as Hashmir said because you\nhave these conventions to take off the gates\n\n\nTraditions are things you you build on and you react against\n\n\nUhm but I will skip one or two one or two examples\n\n\nFirst of all perhaps a a rather uhm a rather uhm uhm deciduous\nexample uhm in in in Singa well in Malaysia and Singaporean history there's\nan important book for this\n\n\nSejarah Melayu which is basically a a chronicle of uhm of the\nhistory of Malacca and also to some extent the history of Singapore as it it\nis its first incarnation as a as a city state as a trading port in the\nthirteenth century uhm\n\n\nAnd I think that's an important resource for us even if we're\nworking not in Malay but in English\n\n\nUhm Stella Kon has used uhm passages examples from Sejarah Melayu\nI've also done so uhm\n\n\nWhen I say it's deciduous example because I I've used in one of my\nstories uh the episode of the sword fish attack on Singapore which many of\nyou are probably uh familiar with it about how the the the the genius of a\nlittle boy saved Singapore from this this terrible terrifying sword fish\nattack\n\n\nSword fish were coming and flying onto the beach and killing\neverybody and so it's a pretty serious situation but this little boy had the\nidea of of cutting down banana stems and building a barricade and of course\nyou can imagine what happened to the sword fish uh course that <unclear> word\n</unclear> stop him\n\n\nThe sword stuck in the bamboo in the banana stems and that was it\nthey were they were easily killed\n\n\nAt least that's what how the story goes\n\n\nBut uhm that's not the really important point of the story\n\n\nThe important point of the story is that uh the the uh the ruler of\nthat time far from uhm uhm congratulating uhm the little boy recognise it ah\nyes here is a threat to uh to my power and uh had the boy executed uhm\n\n\nAnd that of course was was the the point of the story\n\n\nBut I'm I use it in in in a story of mine using it totally\ndeciduously but uhm still trying to work through some of these ideas and\nbring them into my own writing\n\n\nUhm where I had a couple of young boys competing for the attention\nof a of a young girl uhm in the way that goes on all the time\n\n\nAnd the the secret weapon which one of them wheels in or unleashes\nand successfully wins the girl\n\n\nThe girl's attention at any rate though there are complications\nlater on\n\n\nUhm he's to produce this story and captivate them with his story\nuhm uh whereas the other the other boy doesn't have this historical depth to\nwin that particular fight\n\n\nUhm more seriously perhaps uhm I've uhm tried to to use from not\nonly literary resources but also some of the historical things around\nSingapore\n\n\nUhm uhm for example one of my short stories tries to tries to work\non the uhm a a a monument in Cambodia called the bayon who tries to make\ncertain uh good <unclear> word </unclear> imagination to make certain\ncomparisons suggest certain warnings\n\n\nUhm generally just to play around with this this image of the bayon\nthis monumental achievement uhm of a kingdom which shortly thereafter\ndisintegrated uhm and compare that with with Raffles Place our own monumental\nachievement\n\n\nUhm and I I've also tried to work with uhm with some Chinese\nliterary traditions uhm particularly with the Dream of the Red Chamber in\nFirst Loves\n\n\nI I worked off that quite a lot\n\n\nIt's one of the episodes in in in that uhm because I think there\nare there are qualities of of of of sensibility which are things we should\nnot lose which we can rework and bring bring into Singaporean literature\n\n\nUhm perhaps I've I've said enough\n\n\nAnybody who might like to go <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nThank you \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm today's talk uh entitled Writer Beyond Labels\n\n\nSo can you all hear me at the back\n\n\nI think I wanted to approach this from several ways but if I could\nstart for instance very simple\n\n\nSomething I wrote There's nothing wrong in the world when you were\nyour young and people ask you want to do\n\n\nThey mean do you want to be a doctor engineer a lawyer pilot what\n\n\nIf you think you want to be kinder or knowledgable writer they\nthink you're crazy\n\n\nYou're here I understand because you're young have written and\nbelieve want to write some more\n\n\nI'm here because I'm not so young uh I have written and some\nbelieve that I am a writer\n\n\nSo if I'm a writer and you inspire to be writers then question\ncentral question is what can I tell you about becoming a writer\n\n\nThat's I think the underlying thing this whole programme it's a\nvery important question to think for\n\n\nI want to start from the first question if not start <unclear> word\n</unclear> but the talk today focuses on one thing\n\n\nFirst who and what is a writer\n\n\nThat's the first label I wish to mention in speaking to you today\n\n\nUh in a sense entitled Writer: Beyond Labels the first label is\nwriter\n\n\nUhm I think the writer's image is cast in the popular imagination\n\n\nIt's a bit of a mixture amalgam of well-known sometimes famous\nwriters sometimes not so famous writers or infant writers uhm and I think we\nall have our image of what a writer is or should be\n\n\nHence sometimes brooding wearing all black\n\n\nI remember I went to a college once the teacher told that in three\nyears of after speaking to them I was the first one who went up not wearing\nall black\n\n\nUh the writer should be even tragic of course intelligent witty\ngrand in some ways also struggling because all writers and artist should\nstruggle\n\n\nEccentric strange different sometimes I know we all have our little\nimages of the writers may think of where we think what people understand\n\n\nSome of us may be Hemmingway <unclear> word </unclear> Thomas\n<unclear> word </unclear> Black uh Jack Kerouac some <unclear> word\n</unclear> and those of you who are really into Asian literature well you can\nname them\n\n\nUh but for those of us who are English rightly or wrongly may have\nthese images of what stumped the revolt of becoming a writer uh\n\n\nAnd sorry so accurately or inaccurately directly or indirectly\nthese and other writers\n\n\nI haven't mention come to mind when we think of writing writer\n\n\nThat's good I think that's good that it helps us decide on the\nvarious paths we can take path path you should take\n\n\nAnd it also comforts us to know that there the others who have\ntravel on that path before us uh\n\n\nFor example when I started writing uhm one of the real reasons I'm\ninvolved in creative arts programme not so much as much as I am uhm is\nbecause of another poet Doctor Edwin Thumboo who is in charge of this\nprogramme\n\n\nWhen I was about your age yes I was once your age uh Prof Thumboo\nspent a lot of time helping me in my writing uh airing out correction and\ngave some suggestions built in helped many writers in Singapore \n\n\nSo since of locally as well as the foreigner images I mentioned\nit's good for us because we know that there are things we aspire to or even\nsurpass and they are people to look towards as models in a sense", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "9601fdb8-712b-4773-a04a-306eee5888a6", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.643679+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nI would like to uh welcome all of you uh to this uh fourth\nBiotech Workshop for teachers\n\n\nCan I just for a show of hand in case somebody here has last year\nfor this workshop\n\n\nIf you have come here before you don't have to come again\n\n\nI can give you the certificate take the book and go somewhere\n\n\nDon't tell anybody\n\n\nIn anyway somebody has just realised that she has come twice\n\n\nNo okay so this is your first time here right\n\n\nUhm I'll just fill you in with some background of the workshop that\nwe have uh done so far\n\n\nFor the past three years we've been running uh this workshop\n\n\nIn 1990 uh we ran and 1991 we ran the workshop for cover the junior\ncollege teachers\n\n\nAnd when we finished uhm the whole lot of junior college teachers\nwe have to go on now to the secondary school teachers\n\n\nAnd last year second uh some of half or probably a third of\nsecondary school teachers came and this year we are doing the rest\n\n\nUh I'm not sure if we have covered all but uh if we have not then\nuhm next year we might have to run another one\n\n\nSo uhm unless there is a change in policy anywhere whether it's\nfrom Science Centre or from Ministry of Education then we will uh adjust the\ncurriculum of this workshop accordingly right\n\n\nSo uh this could well be the last in the series so I hope you'll uh\nfind this uh uh workshop uh a profitable one\n\n\nOur head of department sends uh uh Professor Kon Oi Lian sends her\napologies for not being able to <unclear> word </unclear> <unclear> word\n</unclear> you address you\n\n\nUh she's taken away for uh an important meeting so she asked me to\nsay uh a few words of welcome on her behalf\n\n\nUh we are very pleased to be involved in this uh project uh in\njoint collaboration with Science Centre the Singapore Society for\nBiochemistry and Molecular Biology\n\n\nUh then the sponsorship of the Economic Development Board uh to\nhold this uh kind of workshop\n\n\nAs we all know that the uh biotechnology is an important industry\nin uh there is growth of importance in uh Western nations is therefore\nessential for Singapore to have some kind of uh economic some kind of in\ngrowth into this very type of industry\n\n\nAnd to do that we need to raise the general awareness of uh\nbiotechnology among the populous\n\n\nThat is why uhm one reason why uh the EDB is sponsoring this uhm\nworkshop under its education and public awareness scheme under the umbrella\nof the National Biotechnology Programme was uh started in 1990\n\n\nBut uh at this point they are many new <unclear> word </unclear> to\nthis in biotechnology and that is why our students of today would become the\nworkforce of tomorrow and uh they should at least have some understanding of\nbiotechnology\n\n\nAll we reach students we need to be school and we are educators\n\n\nThat is why we have this workshop uhm here today\n\n\nUh because uh we may face some uh the uh rush later on maybe it'll\nbe easier if I were to give you your certificate <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nI I I trust you all completely I noticed that uh ex uh there are no\nuh Miss Mrs Anne Dhanaraj is not here\n\n\nYes Mrs Mary Toh is also not here\n\n\nMiss Yeo is also not here so I think it's okay I can give it to you\nalright\n\n\nUhm the first few sections are the introduction and <unclear> word\n</unclear> <unclear> word </unclear> uhm followed by uhm the green notes of\nthe the introductory notes of the lecture followed by the laboratory schedule\n\n\nThere are four practicals that we will be doing in an hour and uh\nplus you'll be amazed that how many things you could do in four hours uh four\nin in in a short span of one hour plus\n\n\nAnd that would be followed by uh several demonstrations which we'll\ndivide you into several groups and then we'll go in a circus <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n\nIf you don't want you can uh uh uh you can move along to the next\none if you're not interested in whatever station it is okay\n\n\nIt's not a case of uh do not pass go or do not collect two hundred\ndollars straight to jail <unclear> word </unclear> <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nWell if you're not interested in a particular section just move on\nokay\n\n\nSo it's uh very easy going I hope you have uh relaxing afternoon in\nview of the stress that we face as educators of our administrators all the\ntime\n\n\nUh that is uh off the off the record\n\n\nUhm so uh do refer to these notes that are when we come to that\nsection now okay\n\n\nUh there are some supplementary notes to accompany these\ndemonstrations and uh <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nI would like now to introduce uh Mrs Anne Dhanaraj who has been\nworking very hard behind the scenes to make sure that uh this project gets\nproper funding and uh she's done a lot of work in uh getting our booklet\nready for us\n\n\nAnd uh we in the past few uhm past three years she's been working\nalso very hard making sure that our provide that continuity in the four\nworkshops that we've conducted so far\n\n\nAnd she's of course aided by many of her able assistants who are\nhere with her today and they are seated at the back\n\n\nWe acknowledge their their uhm very enthusiastic support for this\nBiotech Workshop\n\n\nIn fact I might would like to ask her in fact to say a few words\nwith regard to uh to the uh the new uh exhibits that will be in stored in\nScience Centre soon\n\n\nIn the pipeline secret at the moment\n\n\nSo what's this phase\n\n\nOkay so uhm there will be a brief break where you can have some\nrefreshments uh in the middle\n\n\nI am sorry it's a bit modest one uhm in view of the fact that we\nwant to save avoid being too much of a consumer\n\n\nSo I shall not uhm move on quickly to uh first part of our today's\nuh uh <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nDid you all a <unclear> word </unclear> outline of the the the\nprogramme\n\n\nThey are so <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nGot a couple of lectures until about three o'clock and these will\nbe very short ones\n\n\nAnnouncement that we have to cater to a wide spectrum of people\ncoming from uh diverse back from diverse background and you we have uhm\nassume certain target words that uhm you should know uhm and you know and\nthis will give us our later <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nStop us uhm stop me in the in the middle of my talk to ask me\nquestions okay\n\n\nOtherwise follow me later on and uh squeeze out definitions from me\nlater uhm for use in practicals\n\n\nYou can catch hold of me\n\n\nThere are some people who came in just came in right\n\n\nDid I miss out you certificates\n\n\nNow we begin by uh uh discussing some ideas about what\nBiotechnology is\n\n\nUh what better way than to begin in Singapore The Minister of State\nhas identified biotechnology as one of the twin pillars of Singapore's future\neconomy the other being Information technology\n\n\nAnd which is why uh in the nine early part of this decade the\nnational biotechnology plans was formulated in order to spearhead Singapore's\nentry into this new start rise so called start rise industry which has uh\ncaused a great move in the Western countries\n\n\nOf course a lot of these uh media uh hype about hype about\nbiotechnology was uhm overplayed up uh but we are slowly beginning to see the\nfruits of uhm biotechnology\n\n\nFor instance uh recombinant human insulin is now uh in the market\n\n\nWe have recombinant some of us may have received uh jabs of a\nvaccine jabs of uh uh hepatitis B vaccine\n\n\nPreviously we have to uh round up all the uh homosexuals to uh\nextract syrum <unclear> word </unclear> from them and uh try to purify these\nthin <unclear> word </unclear> particles and then try to formulate the\nvaccine out of them\n\n\nAnd of course that is extremely hazardous both for the for the\npeople who prepare it as well as the recipients of this plasma based vaccine\n\n\nBut with Biotechnological approaches uh is able we are able now to\nproduce safe vaccines for the general uh use by the population\n\n\nSo you can see that some of these material and and later on in the\npractical\n\n\nYou will see some of these Biotechnology products that are hitting\nthe consumer market\n\n\nThat is why all the more reason we should have some basic awareness\nof it's all about\n\n\nBecause of the Biotechnology has been <unclear> word </unclear>\nidentified as important way back in the 19 in the middle of the last decade\nin 1985\n\n\nI remember as a a young

<unclear>\nword </unclear> place down in London and they were so enthusiastic about this\nparticular new venture\n\n\nGoh Keng Swee has uh Mr Goh Keng Swee has Dr Goh Keng Swee\napparently had called up Professor Chris Tan uh assigned him this task of\nsetting up the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology and they were so keen\n\n\nAnd <unclear> word </unclear> in the East end of London Professor\nLouie Lim was spreading out the plans of this particular institute on his uh\nbeautiful floor and then telling me how nice it was and uh I was hoping that\nI've got a place there\n\n\nOf course I didn't\n\n\nUh this institute has been set up built in 1987 bring in quite a\nlot of uh outside talent as well as homegrown talent\n\n\nUh to spearhead research basic research into Molecular Biology and\nCell Biology and you can see this blue building as you approach uh <unclear>\nword </unclear> the university\n\n\nYou can see the building set behind the uh uh greenery of uh Kent\nRidge reserve\n\n\nThis building with its cutting edge <unclear> word </unclear> at\nthe cutting edge of research even the architecture reflects its uh role in uh\nspearheading Singapore bi bioscience\n\n\nOf course this research has been going on kind of research has been\nbasic research has been going on in our de departments for a long time\n\n\nAnd some of you may identify your former mentors\n\n\nBut we have progress a long way since these old equip type of\nequipments uh to sophisticated equipments such as uh this instruments uh\n\n\nHALC type of performance or high pressured liquid chomotography uh\nuh equipment\n\n\nAnd not only that we have uh the research as spilled out from the\nlaboratories to the uh to the field and you can see here a map of Singapore\nwith marked ingredients marked in green the agrotechnology <unclear> word\n</unclear> parks uh that has been set up by the Primary Production Department\n\n\nUh some of these sites are already uh ready and uh some uh\nagrotechnology farms have been set up\n\n\nSo if you do have a chance to uh drive around the outskirts of\nSingapore city do feel free to turn off the beating <unclear> word </unclear>\ntrack and visit some of them <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nHave a look at some of these agrotechnology parks\n\n\nUhm some some of these uh are employing new techniques to culture\nor to grow orchids or hydrofornics <unclear> word </unclear> culture of uh\nall sorts of uhm vegetables and so on\n\n\nSo again we are just not confining our our inroads into\nBiotechnology within the laboratory but also uh in more diverse over\ndiversified front\n\n\nI noticed <unclear> word </unclear> from yesterday that this was\nblocking the view yah\n\n\nFine I will lower this slightly\n\n\nNow bio <unclear> word </unclear> allow me to focus uhm\n\n\nNow the word biotechnology actually is a very loose term and uh\nmany disciplines contribute to the this uh multi-disciplinary subject ranging\nfrom genetics biochemistry chemistry microbiology even across to uh the hard\nsciences and engineering \n\n\nAnd uh as I describe biotechnology later on you will see why\nBecause of this multi-disciplinary approach towards biotechnology it is not\nsurprising that there are many definitions", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nIt's the uhm latest 32 bit operating system from Microsoft\nwhich will offer you both uh the power and reliability but more importantly\nit is an open operating system that is uhm scalable with hardware and\nportable across multiple platform\n\n\nUhm in Microsoft we have this internal rating of our product uhm\nthat is we have products that we develop that we think they are real cool and\nwe have products that we think that they are way cool but for Windows NT we\nthink they are absolutely awesome\n\n\nOkay we are we are really thrilled with the roll out plan of Windows\nNT and particularly with the broad industries report behind Windows NT that\nyou will get to see when I present my charts itself okay\n\n\nSo in the next uh thirty minutes or so I'll like to be able to just\ngo through an overview of Windows NT so that you know uh what Windows NT is\nall about what are the benefits it brings to you and hopefully it'll be it\nwill excite you enough to make sure that you come to my uh Windows NT launch\nwhich is in a couple of months\n\n\nSo stay tune and look out for the uh the press release or or the\nannouncement of the launch\n\n\nFirst I'll like to just share with you what is Microsoft system\nstrategy and what is our key objective\n\n\nOne we really want to build the Windows uh fam into a family of\nproducts\n\n\nYou are quite well aware of today that Windows 3.1 is in fact the\ndefacto standard\n\n\nIt's selling more than a million copies per month so what and and it\nis primarily being uh uh available uh or being run on on a desktop\nenvironment itself\n\n\nSo what we what to do is really to extend Windows NT's family uh or\nrather Windows family to reach the corporate mission critical computing\nenvironment\n\n\nAnd also reach downwards to non PC devices such as office and\nconsuming uh consumer environment which you will a lot about it in a couple\nof months\n\n\nSo if you will this is really a uh graphical representation of our\nsystem strategy okay\n\n\nAnd uh there are various options by which we could uhm uhm consider\nin implementing our Win fab Windows family of products\n\n\nOne is that we're going to have taken a one size fit all kind of\napproach whereby uh we build one implementation of Windows and making sure it\naddress all the requirements of the user\n\n\nOr the another approach is what uh is is to build a single uh\narchitecture such <unclear> word </unclear> such that it provide a very\nconsistent look and feel a very consistent programming model\n\n\nAnd also a ability to provide assistance uh consistent underlying\nnetwork uh technology so that the idea is that you can have a single\narchitecture\n\n\nBut you can implement new technology in the various uhm uh\nimplement it in various ways such that it will address all the various\nspecific users' needs okay\n\n\nSo we have adopted the latter approach and we think it is a uh\nunique approach in the market place <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nGiven the ability to spend Windows NT of products from all the way\nnotebook pen-computing and all the way to a RISC work station and symmetric\nmulti-processing environment itself\n\n\nTo the Windows family of products includes Windows 3.1 Windows\nworkbook NT Windows NT and even the advance server\n\n\nThey are all complementary products and are not meant to replace\none another itself\n\n\nSo if you look at Windows and Windows workgroup it is primarily uhm\na the desktop application arena where it focus on the individual PC user uh\nenhancing its productivity and being the mainline business application for\nthe user itself\n\n\nWhereas Windows NT is directly a super set of Windows 3.1 or\nWindows for workbook if you will\n\n\nOkay it is really targeted at the business and technical computing\nenvironment\n\n\nIt is designed to the client server uh a client server is designed\nto the client server operating system providing a high level of uh\nfunctionality and robustness in the operating system so that its needs is\nvery targeted on the inset itself okay\n\n\nSo what are some of the design goals when we started the Windows NT\n\n\nWe wanted it to be a small true 32-bit multi-tasking operating\nsystem based upon the microkerner uh design okay\n\n\nThat it has to be portable across Intel and the RISC platform and\nit will have to support multiple subsystem such as DOS Win 16 Win 32 POSIX OS\n2 right\n\n\nAnd it also has to support the very the merging multiprocessing uh\nenvironment itself\n\n\nAnd finally huge capacities because we're talking about business\nand the technical computing environment\n\n\nSince we started our we held our first uh Windows NT 32 developers\nconference in San Francisco the momentum for Windows NT is just tremendous\n\n\nAnd I just want to take a few moments to go through a couple of\ncharts to tell you what where are where are the industry support what are\nindustry talking about it okay\n\n\nUhm we have managed to ship about sixty thousands SD case which are\nsoftware development kit uh within seven months from the day we uh had the uh\nWindows developer conference in San Francisco\n\n\nAnd we have about four hun four thousand corporate customers\nworldwide evaluating Windows NT today and I and that number is going to go up\nto twenty thousand with a <unclear> word </unclear> with a much later\n\n\nAnd in fact the book Inside Windows NT and if some of you have\nattended uh the lucky three hundred customers who attended my Windows NT\ncorporate preview in March you might have a copy of this book\n\n\nIn fact it has been the number two uh in the computer book uh best\nselling list\n\n\nIn fact it outsell the famous book by Madonna itself\n\n\nAnd uh we have just recently completed a survey uhm we did a random\nuh sample of the people at that time who have purchased the software\ndevelopment kit to find out who they are and what they are intending to do\nwith it cause that that is important to us as well as for our customer itself\n\n\nAnd we find that eighty three per cent of the guys who actually\nbought it are developer so that's good news\n\n\nAnd ten per cent of these guys are con consultants and seven per\ncent of them are end user\n\n\nAnd when we ask what they were going to do with the developer kit\ntwenty-one per cent said they were actually going to develop applications for\nresell alright\n\n\nTwenty-seven said it was for internal use and eighteen per cent for\nconsulting customers uhm\n\n\nObviously it's going to be a a formable forth in an environment and\nconsultants have to know how to consul how to implement for their customers\nin consultancy area\n\n\nAnd four per cent of that data be for personal use\n\n\nBut more but more interesting is this chart and I do apologise for\nit being very wordy and actually not very clear it's not very sharp\n\n\nUhm about three thousand developer says that they going have us\ndevelop more than nine thousand retail Windows application NT applications\nwithin the next twelve months\n\n\nExcuse me\n\n\nAnd that's a lot of application uh on Windows NT to be available as\nit roll out uh in in the next couple of months\n\n\nAnd fifty-seven per cent of these developers said they in fact are\ndeveloping Windows NT application for mission critical line and business\napplications\n\n\nThis is exactly what we have targeted it for and it's and we are\ndevelop developing mission critical line and bi business application for\nWindows NT\n\n\nAnd sixty-nine per cent of the new Windows NT application in fact\nis designed in a client server environment\n\n\nAnd twenty-five per cent of developers are actually beginning to\nport UNIX MBS and even BMS application uh onto Windows NT itself\n\n\nThere are a lot of developer too tools available today seventy plus\nof them and you see a lot more being available as the product being rolled\nout\n\n\nBut what is really interesting to find is that leading mainframe\ntool vendors like computer associate <unclear> word </unclear> knowledge ware\nthese guys are porting their tools on Windows NT\n\n\nAnd think about if you are a corporate uh or MIS developer you're\nso used to using these tools and we have the same tools running on Windows NT\n\n\nAnd that would really facilitate your effort in uh trying to\ndevelop client server application itself\n\n\nSo who would want Windows NT\n\n\nDefinitely the Windows Power users\n\n\nBy that we mean these are the people uhm who who will buy the the\nfastest and the greatest in technology\n\n\nThey will usually be the first adopter and they very often\n<unclear> word </unclear> play a role as a Window as a leader in the Windows\ncommunity itself\n\n\nSo we certainly think that the Windows Power user will will be out\nthere to grab for Windows NT MIS and Business solution builders definitely uh\nwhere their role is past the developing application for their organisation\n\n\nOr for their customers Windows NT will definitely provide a very uh\nrobust environment for which they can deploy solution for customers or for\nthemselves their own organisation\n\n\nAdvance business application users these are the guys that is\nprobably running a claims processing application in insurance industry or it\ncould be a banking application or an order processing application\n\n\nAnd these guys can actually run all these <unclear> word </unclear>\napplication of Windows NT given that it's a very secure environment\n\n\nDevelopers definitely our target uhm you've seen with the\nanti-clave a lot of developers are in fact developing applications for\nWindows NT\n\n\nAnd finally the engineering and uh technical users so wherever they\nare a CAD/CAM designer for a automative or a airline uhm industry they\ncertainly will be able to use Windows NT\n\n\nBecause there are a lot of the uh leading CAD/CAM software vendors\ntoday are porting their application to Windows NT and one of these examples\nis intergraph\n\n\nIn fact they they gonna port quite a complete suite of their\nproducts to Windows NT itself\n\n\nSo what is Windows NT\n\n\nIt has a core set of features okay and uhm one of the first and\nforemost one of the most important asset that you will able to uhm uh uh to\nto advantage is that the fact that Windows NT is Windows okay\n\n\nSo whether you're running a Windows application or looks like\nWindows and so forth it is Windows it is that user interface that you you've\ngrown to use uh all this while and grown to love okay\n\n\nIn addition it will also have provides you with scaleable power\nsecurity reliability easy management compatibility with a lot of the variety\nof systems that is available today\n\n\nAnd most importantly an open platform for a lot of third party\ninnovations itself and we'll go into some of these in details uhm uhm in this\ncouple of charts\n\n\nWindows NT is Windows so it won't within some uh common function as\nin Windows and that's typically that it is going to be easy to use\n\n\nYou act you can see Windows NT being demonstrated behind the room\n\n\nIt is exactly like the Windows interface data workend\n\n\nSo there is very little uhm uhm time needed in uh learning to use\nthe system\n\n\nAll you need to want to be concern with is how do I use my\napplication cause that's what you want the system do for you not learn a new\noperating system that has that require you to learn to to go through a new\nand to rethink\n\n\nSo this a very logical migration for someone who has been used to\nWindows environment sit on the Windows NT and start being productive of their\nsystem today\n\n\nWe certainly have a a a a very uh rich set of applications today\nthat's already on Windows 3.1 and this set of applications will run on\nWindows NT \n\n\nThe last three points are really uh fundamental addition to the\nWindows platform of products which will begin to see as a consistent\nfunctionality that were prevalent in the whole suite of Windows family of\nproducts that is uh basically the Botian networking so as you buy Windows NT\nyou could actually be able to do a peer to peer networking with your\ncolleagues sharing files uh and printers and also email each other okay", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f7e9bd57-1625-43fb-8d77-21daf7e43b1f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.645569+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nAnd in fact when I started teaching since 84 I realise one\nthing that a lot of men and women has great substance great potential\n\n\nRight before a lot of them didn't realise that they could do far\ngreater things than what they have been doing\n\n\nAnd there's another group of people that they try hard to but they\ncan't reach it there because they seems to be beating around the bushes\n\n\nAnd there's another group of people that who wake up in the morning\nand blame god for what they are\n\n\nAnd those that are people who never get going\n\n\nAnd also there's also another group of people that have great\nsubstance but never feel convince anybody that they have\n\n\nThey never give themselves a chance for us to discover them because\nof their exterior that they put across\n\n\nSo we're going to show you today that how human being read you and\nbetween you and god you know what god expect out of you\n\n\nBut you have to also understand that you're already in this earth\n\n\nWhen you deal with people and you must know what people want from\nyou before you can talk about your god before you can talk about anything\nthat you want to say\n\n\nAlright so beauty is so important that it is no more really you do\nwhat you like because you're not really in a world of your own by yourself\n\n\nYou have to do what you like best and what others like you to do as\nwell\n\n\nBecause if you do what you like and others can't stand it you're\ngoing to pay a price for being wrong a tremendous heavy prices that you can\nnever calculate\n\n\nOpportunities in life lost\n\n\nA great opportunities that can never be calculated\n\n\nAlright so you have to come to understanding about what others want\nand by the time you're able to make others feel comfortable to be with you\neven then your likings will change because others like you in a certain thing\n\n\nMajority of our what we like what we prefer is influence by what\nothers like us to project\n\n\nIsn't it true\n\n\nWhy you like a certain outfit\n\n\nWhy do you like a certain look because your friend like you to be\nlike that\n\n\nIsn't it true\n\n\nYou like a certain dress because everytime you wear it people say\nthat you look great\n\n\nYou wear a certain tie everytime you wear it people say your tie\nlooks nice\n\n\nRemember your tie look nice not you okay\n\n\nThere's a lot difference between hey you look great today rather\nthan your dress is beautiful alright\n\n\nAnd and I started learning from human being every talk and every\nclass and every people I have meet I learn one thing that there's a lot of\ndifference between people who are poorer and a lower living standard and\npeople go higher\n\n\nAnd as you go higher doesn't mean that you're happier\n\n\nAs you go rich it doesn't mean that you're happier\n\n\nAnd a happiest person I've ever seen are people who are able to\nbring themselves down to the same group of people they're mixing with\n\n\nThe happiest people are people who are able to be accepted by human\nbeings\n\n\nIsn't it true\n\n\nSo how do you come to a compromise and how do you project it\nthrough\n\n\nWith all first and foremost through your exterior image you get\nexposure you improve and you upgrade\n\n\nI'm not saying by if uh dressing nicely you'll be rich\n\n\nDo you understand\n\n\nI'm just saying that if you can be for for a club and you can be\nthe best for the club\n\n\nIf you achieve you promoted to be secretary and you know I'm\nsecretary be a best looking secretary or it give you incentive to perform\nbetter\n\n\nYour boss can see that you're well-guarded it give you more\nincentive to upgrade\n\n\nThat's how people move on in life alright\n\n\nNow the dressing plays a very important role the colour the style\nthe texture the prints and fabric\n\n\nAny one part of it wrong enough to make you look awful\n\n\nAnd before I can teach you how to dress in <unclear> word\n</unclear> all of us here have to one thing when we go back home\n\n\nJust take a mirror and take a good look at ourself and tell ourself\nthat we're good-looking okay\n\n\nI tell you why I tell you why you have to do that because too many\nof us want to be like someone else\n\n\nThe small eyes wants to make bigger the flat nose want to have it\nhigher the square face want to have it rounder and the round face want to\nhave it longer\n\n\nI always tell people that small eyes can be nice\n\n\nDon't you agree\n\n\nRight so if you if you don't learn to like yourself it is very\ndifficult for others to learn to like you\n\n\nIsn't it true\n\n\nIf you can't even stand your face how can people like your face\n\n\nRight irregardless of your shortness your height the darkness the\nfairness even to the extent of being bald you can be great in your own way\n\n\nAnd first by using colours of your coordination and after that we\nmake you look rarefied using different styles and fabrics that you use\n\n\nYou just have to remember that it's doesn't even cost a lot if you\nknow how and cost a lot if you don't know how and bring out the best of you\n\n\nI am going to take you to the first part of the talk on how the\ncolours can match you and then the style\n\n\nThen we go for a break and after that after the break we're going\nto teach you how to carry yourself through\n\n\nYou having outfit but don't know how to sit and walk and and move\nproperly\n\n\nPeople can't respect your outfit as well alright\n\n\nNow with colours probably that you can wear many women alike\ndressing it's not just for women you have to understand that\n\n\nIt's a lot more important for men as well because men don't use\nmakeup\n\n\nSo when they are wrong they are completely wrong\n\n\nAnd and women can get away and run away with some parts of it wrong\nand some parts of it right\n\n\nThat's why it's so important for men\n\n\nNow the colours that you can wear you have to remember that got\nnothing with how young or how old you are\n\n\nSo what I tell you today you will not feel strong much alright\n\n\nIt's not true when your mother says that I am fifty-five now and\nseventy now I shouldn't be wearing red anymore\n\n\nI don't see why when you are older you should try and make yourself\nlook older\n\n\nIn fact the older you are the younger you should try and look right\n\n\nThe younger you are you can afford to look older\n\n\nDoes it make sense\n\n\nIf you're eighteen year old you don't mind looking thirty because\neven if you look thirty cause even if you look thirty you're not that old\n\n\nBut the time you're sixty you should try and look like forty\n\n\nOkay I tell you when I didn't realise it's so important age is so\nimportant until I started teaching\n\n\nAnd there's this a very matured Chinese American Chinese who come\nto me\n\n\nAnd she walked into my studio and she said I want to see Jill\n\n\nAnd she sat next to me and she said are you Jill\n\n\nShe was very <unclear> word </unclear> screening me all the way\ndown\n\n\nI said yes I am Jill why'd you expect me to be forty years old\n\n\nWe talk over the phone she thought I was forty years old\n\n\nAnd I said I'm going to teach you how to be forty looking like me\nand after that she has completely different face\n\n\nShe realised that you can be forty looking like me\n\n\nYou understand the different\n\n\nIt doesn't mean you are forty you must look like forty alright\n\n\nNow it's got nothing to do with your age colours that you can wear\nwhether it's your hair colour your spectacles right down to your socks and\nshoes that you wear has got nothing to do also with how fair or how dark you\nare\n\n\nOtherwise all the Indians must wear same colour okay\n\n\nI tell you one big problem here we took four years to get the right\nto do it here because the American claim that we Chinese are all the same\n\n\nWe're all fair skinned dark hair dark eyes\n\n\nYou just turn around and look at all your friends\n\n\nMany of you've got dark hair but many of you do not have black hair\n\n\nDo you understand\n\n\nA lot of people tell you have but you don't have black hair\n\n\nThat's the big difference okay\n\n\nSo we are not interested in how fair or how dark you are\n\n\nAnd also we are not interested in how fat or how thin you are\n\n\nAt this moment colour cannot make a person look slim\n\n\nHave you ever heard of people saying that you are fat you wear\nblack you look slim\n\n\nHow many of you have raise your hand\n\n\nWhen you are fat you make yourself black say you look slimmer\n\n\nNow remember that black is one of the one of the strongest\nattention drawing colours of all colours\n\n\nSo if you are fat and you wear black\n\n\nThe first thing people see is the black and there there you're fat\n\n\nCan you hear\n\n\nAs I've mentioned that there's nothing wrong being fat and there's\nnothing wrong being thin and there's nothing wrong being old\n\n\nIt takes you to like your fat\n\n\nIt takes you like yourself and old people can see you that see\nthat you grow and respectable and gracefully okay\n\n\nNow what'll be a good example from <unclear> word </unclear> is\ncan you imagine two women who got fat legs going to a party going to a\nfunction and one is very conscious about it so she wear black to make her\nlook slim\n\n\nThe other think that you know it's not a problem because my my\nlegs are not that gorgeous\n\n\nI might as well just wear pink colour so nobody can see\n\n\nNow these two women go to the party one in black stocking one in\npink colour stocking\n\n\nNow who do you think will look obviously in this fabric\n\n\nThe one in black isn't it\n\n\nSo what more it is on the whole length on the body\n\n\nEverybody will notice that you're fat\n\n\nAre you clear now\n\n\nSo remember all the more you're fat you should stay away from\nblack\n\n\nTo make a person look slim or fat is is found on the clothing\n\n\nThe fabric that you can use the print of the fabric alright the\nlength and the detail the cut of the clothing not the colour okay\n\n\nThe colours that you can wear relates to your skin colour or the\nprint <unclear> word </unclear> <unclear> word </unclear> you call it\nwarm-cool warm or cold\n\n\nNow how do you see it's warm and cool\n\n\nA person who is warm looks golden\n\n\nThey get freckles easily\n\n\nSo people who are warm looks bronzy\n\n\nThey just stay dark and brown all the time\n\n\nThey are the ones who can carry umbrella wherever they go they\nwill still look so warm\n\n\nThey are the ones who can use seven-day scrub imagine if they\nscrub everyday scrub no use\n\n\nRight they just look bronzy\n\n\nWhen they get dark they look very dark like Bill Crosby\n\n\nYou know Bill Crosby\n\n\nThey're very dark brown to black <unclear> word </unclear> you\ncall them\n\n\nNow the cool ones are porcelain-pale white ones porcelain-pale\nwhite ones\n\n\nThose are the people where you see them they're porcelain white\n\n\nBy the time they get suntan or baking themselves for two three\ndays in the sun they will only turn red like a lobster but they never look\nbrown okay \n\n\nThey are the ones that eventually when they do get dark they will\njust look plain burn", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "af128e75-556a-48b4-8605-c8c74d64ee6d", "added":

More Ghost of Singapore so my friends uh pull my leg\nand say that my initials stand for ghost story teller\n\n\nOf course GST stands for something more horrible now\n\n\nUh actually how I came about writing ghost stories was that while I\nstarted off in an unguarded moment writing the story The Ghost Lover of\nEmerald Hill\n\n\nUhm that's about that's uhm uh about a haunted house that I\nremember from my childhood days\n\n\nUh it's a house in Emerald Hill and uh reporters from the press\nhave been trying to get me to identify which house but being a developer or\ninvolved with development companies uh I do not want to disclose because it\nmight uh lower the value of the house\n\n\nBut in any case the house is no longer haunted\n\n\nUh it was haunted uh during the time when I was a kid and uh the\nghost did scare away quite a number of families\n\n\nBut ultimately the ghost lover came along and he solve the problem\n\n\nUh I shall be reading you some extracts later on on these stories\nwhich I have written\n\n\nBut after I wrote The Ghost Lover of Emerald Hill my friends\nthought that uh I had become a kind of an expert in ghost stories\n\n\nSo they kept on telling me their ghost stories their own ghost\nstories asking me to become their ghost writer as it were\n\n\nHence I discovered that I uh was quite popular with Ghost of\nSingapore\n\n\nAnd in fact the Ghost of Singapore sold so well that my publisher\ninsisted I should come out with More Ghost of Singapore and this has been\nselling well too\n\n\nBut uh it's rather a bad reputation so I'm trying to make a break\naway from ghost and uh I in the mean time have written another uh book called\nThe Nan Mei-Su Girls of Emerald Hill\n\n\nThese are some girls I knew uh when I was in Emerald Hill\n\n\nI stayed in Emerald Hill for the best part of my young youth uh\nwhen I was a child and when I was a young man and uh uh the Nan Mei-Su girls\nwere actually waitresses working in a in a Japanese restaurant\n\n\nAnd many people confuse them with the prostitutes the uh uh who\nwere use by the uh Japanese army\n\n\nAnd uh of course when the uh story came out uh I had to keep on\ndenying that they were prostitutes\n\n\nI was defending their honour when I was a kid because the\nneighbours always thought that they were bad girls but I I they were my\nfriends and I knew they were not bad girls\n\n\nThey were people who were earning a living and I find that fifty\nyears later I am still defending their honour\n\n\nUh anyway uh what I propose to do this morning is just to uh\nillustrate the points which I am making with some extracts from the stories\nand perhaps even some some of the poems which I have written\n\n\nNow before I go on I mustn't forget the title\n\n\nThe title is To right or not to right - That is the question\n\n\nThat is not the question\n\n\nIn fact to write or not to write that is the question uh depends on\nhow you spell write\n\n\nUh to right or not to right that is not a question in my mind\nbecause uh I don't think a writer should really be involved in an activist\nmanner with issues\n\n\nIf he wants to be actively involve he goes out and becomes a\npolitician or a lawyer fighting a case or you know anybody that is trying to\nright a wrong\n\n\nSo the writer should be more concern with whether he's to write and\nthat's spelt with a double u\n\n\nTo write or not to write that is the question\n\n\nTo write or not to write\n\n\nUh if he has it in him and uh he can express it then he should\nwrite\n\n\nIf he has it in him and cannot express it he should not write\n\n\nIf he hasn't got it in him but can express whatever he hasn't got\nhe still shouldn't write\n\n\nSo to write or not to write that is the question double u\n\n\nTo write or not to write that is the question\n\n\nAnd uh I think that uh writers have to be sure about these two\naspects\n\n\nWhat he has in him what he can say ideas expression ideas\nexpression\n\n\nThese are the two two two main things\n\n\nUh you must have the ideas and you must know how to express them\nand these two make a writer\n\n\nThe theme of this whole uhm conference is Bridging Worlds and I\nthink uh my topic is particularly relevant in this respect because the\nwriter's main role is really to bridge worlds\n\n\nHe has something he wants to say and he has to bridge this world\nacross to that world to the other world\n\n\nHe has to be able to convey what is important to him what he thinks\nis worth expressing worth talking about worth letting other people people\nknow\n\n\nAnd he ha to bridge worlds the main world being himself and the old\nrest of mankind\n\n\nSo first task is bridge worlds and what what has he to offer\n\n\nHe has what his perception of life the truths as he sees them\n\n\nThe truths may come about in different ways\n\n\nIt may be a young person under oppression because of the lack of\nunderstanding of the older folks\n\n\nSomehow or other he he or she would want to put this across so that\nhopefully we pick up somewhere it'll help other some other people\n\n\nIt could be uh the gap between not between generations but the gap\nbetween sexes\n\n\nIt could be the gap between races the gap between religions\n\n\nThere are many worlds that require bridging and I think a writer's\ndecision whether to write or not to write should be based on whether he has\ngot something to say\n\n\nAnd that he has he has the way to express it with regard to matters\nwhich would help to bridge worlds\n\n\nNow this is talking in in very uh you know high faluting terms and\nso on\n\n\nWell when it come down to uh more basic things you are really\ntalking about uh maybe minor things or things which appear to be minor but\ncan be very important\n\n\nUh so these things will come out in in in in in uh the various\nworks uh that you write\n\n\nAt one time when I started write write writing I found that uh uh\none of my difficulties was really the lack of experience the lack of life\nexperience\n\n\nUh but you make up for that in a way because you make up for that\nbecause you talk to people and if you develop that perception you'll begin to\nunderstand\n\n\nYou get a second-hand experience\n\n\nYou read you get a second-hand experience\n\n\nBut for some people that second-hand hand experience is even more\nin depth and more meaningful than first-hand experience for for for other\npeople\n\n\nYou'll you will come across many people like that who would go\nthrough life you know experiencing something day after day\n\n\nBut at the end of the of uh you know several years and decades and\nso on would really miss the point totally\n\n\nSo it is intensity and the perception which you bring to bear on\nexperience\n\n\nWhether first-hand second-hand or third-hand that is important\n\n\nSo don't be fazed in anyway don't be worried in anyway by lack of\nexperience because you can make up for it in many ways\n\n\nExpression that is a more difficult area that's an area where you\nhave to sweat over you have to learn a lot\n\n\nYou have to learn like reading you have to learn uh from the advice\nthat you get from others and from your own trial and error and then you pick\nup\n\n\nYou will find quite soon enough that if you start off if you have\nif you start off with humour you win a lot of people\n\n\nUh then if you want to be solemn and you want to talk about\nsomething which matters a lot something which is very sensitive uh has an\nemotional content\n\n\nThen you're going to find it very difficult to it like this from me\nacross to you in a big lecture hall like that\n\n\nYou'll find it easier one on one uh you'll find it easier if it is\nwhen the group is smaller\n\n\nBut still a writer has to do it not one on one but one on many\nbecause his book will be read by so many different people\n\n\nHe's not going to scold everybody here many people that have been\ngoing to uh to uh not like what he has written\n\n\nThat doesn't really matter he should accept that\n\n\nBut if you are getting your message across you're bridging worlds\nthat's what counts and sometimes uh you may only reach a minority\n\n\nBut that minor minority may be the important minority\n\n\nSo it doesn't matter you still have to write\n\n\nNow let me uh give you some illustrations of things which I of\nthings which I have written\n\n\nUh first of all to make my point of about uh humour\n\n\nThis is a a story from the book The Ghost Lover of Emerald Hill and\nother stories and the title of the story is The Curse of Hylinmong\n\n\nIt's about my grandfather and it's partly true\n\n\nBut there is a lot of bullshit about it as well\n\n\nWell there I was telling a story of introducing my grandfather but\nuh you see if you if you introduce humour take it along lightly uh you have a\nbetter chance or uh keeping the reader with you\n\n\nUh I have some friends who tell me that they like this part of the\nstory but unfortunately they don't buy the book\n\n\nThey just read it in the bookshops and put it back in the selves\n\n\nThat's one of the hazards that uh writers will have to go through\n\n\nWell there's that is an example of a light approach\n\n\nNow let me uh read you a story which is a little bit more serious\n\n\nYes when I was uh round your age or so some fifty years ago that's\nhow great our generation gap is uh it was the Japanese occupation\n\n\nAnd uh I my schooling was interrupted and then I went to a Japanese\nschool\n\n\nAnd in that Japanese school we learn the Japanese language and\nJapanese culture and a bit of that has remain in me and at one time we\nthought that we were the beginning of a new generation\n\n\nYou know previously we were in a colonial situation under the\nBritish and now we were talking about the greater co-prosperity sphere of the\nJapanese\n\n\nWe were talking about Japanese culture and we thought that we were\nyou know going some places\n\n\nUh little did we know that uh because going to end so soon\n\n\nOf course we we we also experience some of the atrocities and so\non but there's another side to it and this is where a writer comes in \n\n\nYou you you you show that there are different facets to a\nsituation even uh in a terrible time like the Japanese occupation And let me\nread you a page from Sayonara Sinsei which is a a story in The Ghost Lover as\nwell", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "07fe2819-e5e4-4e5f-bb95-743e6b3f8fcf", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nAnymore people coming in\n\n\nUhm where should we start today\n\n\nNow from the from novel to stage uh from novel to stage\n\n\nUhm uh let me just say first that I have I've had only one\nexperience of doing this\n\n\nSo you know I'm an authority as such uh because I don't spend my\nwhole uh theatre career translating or tra transforming\n\n\nI use the word the term translating books into plays alright\n\n\nUh very often uh I I I start my work from a from a playwright's work\nor uh just from the actors\n\n\nUh in fact I very seldom uh uh write stuff myself\n\n\nEven when I translate from a novel to to stage from book to a stage\nthe one experience I had I worked primarily with actors to create this\nexperience okay\n\n\nUhm what do you all think is the primarily difference between a\nnovel or a book and a stage\n\n\nAny volunteers\n\n\nBecause once we understand the difference we'll be able to zero in\non what exactly uhm we have to do in in this translation\n\n\nRight let's look at those uh points\n\n\nUhm I think that straight away one of the one of the uh the the\nfirst speaker talked about uh the fact that in uh uh in a in a performance\n\n\nOkay I would say that the novel the primary difference first of all\nis that novel is a written piece of work\n\n\nIt's text while stage of course is performance\n\n\nUh we're we're not talking about about translating from a a novel\ninto a into a play\n\n\nWe're trans for trans for talking about translation from novel into\nthe stage which which means performance\n\n\nAnd uh immediately it involves an audience\n\n\nI mean you don't get a situation of of three hundred and sixty\npeople reading from one giant book right\n\n\nI mean reading is a very private experience in a sense that it's a\none-to-one relationship with the with the book\n\n\nUh while in a in a theatre you have to think about the audience uhm\nand about the communion between what's happening on stage and what's\nhappening in the audience\n\n\nOkay the the the the the reason why I use the word communion is\nthat it's important to relate to the audience\n\n\nIt's not it's not going to be uh enough of a threatrical experience\nif the actor son stage uh uh uh only relating to themselves and there's\nnothing no no energy flowing out towards the audience\n\n\nWhile in a sense for a book it's very different\n\n\nI mean the novelist writes the book and he doesn't have to have any\npotent energy jumping up from the book uh into into the reader's uh uh uh uh\ninto into the reader's feel/field as such\n\n\nSo immediately we come to one main difference in that theatre has\nto have a dynamism okay\n\n\nThe stage has to have a dynamism that means that it cannot be a a a\nuhm a an experience of just of just uh uh imbibing the atmosphere\n\n\nIt has to be a three dimensional experience uh which is immediately\nanother difference between the book which is two dimensional and theatre\nwhich is three dimensional because you have uh uh the actors you have the\nthree dimensional sets etcetera etcetera\n\n\nUhm one of you brought up also that it's about it's not just not\nabout thoughts it's also about action okay\n\n\nA primary definition of theatre uh in the olden times okay uh the\nthe uh uh from the Greek times is that it only needs three elements fro\ntheatre\n\n\nOne is that you need a a a a space okay and uh by a space what is\ndefine as space you can just use a chalk to draw up a square on a floor and\nthat is your performance space\n\n\nTwo you need actors uh uh uh with finally three a conflict okay\n\n\nSo you need actors uh relating in terms of actions\n\n\nAnd number three you need a conflict between the actors okay\n\n\nThat's all you need to create a play\n\n\nSo you can just have a situation where man A meets man B in a space\nand uh uh they have uh uh different views about life\n\n\nAnd from there the clash you know develops and then a piece of\ntheatre can happen okay\n\n\nUh and so in a sense theatre is about action and not just about\nthoughts\n\n\nTheatre is a is a is a playing out of thoughts uhm and the the the\nthe key word the third key word there conflict also relates to dynamism\nbecause you can only by dynamic when there is a conflict right okay\n\n\nUh do you understand what I mean by dynamism meaning that uh you\ncan't really have a a a play in which nothing happens\n\n\nI mean you can of course\n\n\nI mean that's that's an experimental\n\n\nWell because I myself have done something like that where where\nnothing really happens Backette?? for example\n\n\nOkay where nothing really happens\n\n\nUh but within that silence or within the emptiness something is\nhappening that means that you're you're you're you're looking at at uh uh an\naction happening within space zero or time zero okay\n\n\nUhm and going back to the the the term dynamism and conflict uhm we\ncannot simply in a sense have people sitting on stage unless you're\ninterested in looking at spatial arrangements and lights and bodies moving in\nthe light\n\n\nThat means it becomes a kind of kind of dance ritual or movement\nritual okay right\n\n\nWhile in a book like in Thomas Hardy famous for pages and pages of\nscenic description appear on the countryside\n\n\nBut you can't really do that in uh uh uh on stage because there\nisn't any dynamism alright\n\n\nYou can you you you can create that panorama of scenery in a film\nfor example and <unclear> word </unclear> with with music you know it can be\na a a a a a wondrous experience like for example uh uh Merchant <unclear>\nword </unclear> Ivory's <unclear> word </unclear> films\n\n\nUh it's it's very much that he always rolls as to pan his camera\nthrough the the countryside\n\n\nAnd then there is music and you and you and the au the the the the\nfilm goer is left to the sense of what just happen in that last scene\n\n\nIn a sense you you you have time to to view the scenery and almost\nlook at the last scene happening between Vanessa Redgrave and uh uh and\nwhoever uh in a diff different perspective okay\n\n\nBut in in theatre it's very very difficult because it's life\n\n\nAnd so if you actually do uh uh uh moments like that you're going\nto start to have a restless audience or pockets of restlessness uh happening\nokay\n\n\nSo uh we're talking about dynamism we're talking about conflict\nwe're talking about action uhm\n\n\nAnd uh in relation to what some of you some of the rest of you\nbrought about soliloquies\n\n\nUh well in in film also you can also have a soliloquy\n\n\nYou can have a voice over like in uh uh the translation of Tennesse\nWilliam's uh play into the movie\n\n\nI think John Malkerwech?? was talking all the time as the as the\nbrother and he was he was having a solliloquy while uh uh the the movie was\nmoving on okay\n\n\nUhm and also in a in in a book you you also have solliloquies\nhappening because it's a personal uh it's a personal impression of let's say\nwhat happened in in Cornwall alright or in the uh in in the Devonshire\nalright\n\n\nAnd he's writing the whole chapter so that's already a kind of\nsolliloquy\n\n\nUhm it's that clear up to this point\n\n\nOkay now the theatre being a visual experience\n\n\nOkay that's that's uh uh uh extremely important because in\nyesterday's session with with the the the secondary students I talked about\nthe uh uh uh key words of immediacy the magic of the moment\n\n\nOkay that theatre is all about immediacy\n\n\nYou must have something happening there and then the emotion must\nbe real the emotion must be true and it cannot be it cannot be something\nwhich you can cut and refilm alright\n\n\nSo you must have the immediacy and the magic of the moment and\nhence theatre must be vivid\n\n\nIt it's a whole immediate moment where as the audience who sit\nthere and you you either washed over with emotions which are so powferable??\nbecause of what's happening on stage between two characters or you're washed\nover by the visual experience okay it's\n\n\nSo theatre or stage is an experiential uh uh uh experience\n\n\nIt's it's it's exactly that you see while in a sense and is of all\nsenses\n\n\nIt's it's the play touching all senses sight sound uh sometimes you\nmay have incense in a in a small black box smell uh uh uh uh uh uh all your\nsenses all being stimulated while in a in a book it's different okay\n\n\nUhm we walked some of you talked as well about how uh between a\nbook uh and also a a stage experience there is personal space for the for the\naudience member\n\n\nWhat do I mean by personal space\n\n\nMeaning that when you read the book you can make your you you can\nsort of stop reading for a while and just close your eyes and imagine what's\nhappening in a chapter\n\n\nUh but you can also do that in a theatre experience in a sense that\nyou make up your mind as to what's happening on stage\n\n\nUh but there are many plays like some of the plays that I do which\nare extremely aggressive\n\n\nThat means there's no time for you to for you the audience to uh to\nstop and uh and reflect\n\n\nBut you're you're constantly pounded by what's happening on stage\n\n\nBut a theatre experience can also be such that the director designs\nit such that there is space for the audience to breathe and to think about\nwhat has happen okay alright\n\n\nUh anyone else brought up points which is not address\n\n\nYes of course that if you're a writer who's very concerned that\nyour every word every feeling must be exact\n\n\nThen I recommend that you write a novel instead of a play because\nuh the the primary creation\n\n\nOkay this is a this is a a a an old view okay and I'm I'm just\ntalking about the the the old view\n\n\nThe primary creative of drama comes from the writer and the\nsecondary creativity comes from the director and actor alright\n\n\nSo that if you are very very uh uh jealous about your work you\nmustn't write a play because finally the play goes to a group of people who\nwork on your text as a basic starting point\n\n\nSo what you may have intented is transformed uh into something else\nalright okay\n\n\nBecause there are many ways of uh of of of looking at it\n\n\nI mean a director and a group of actors can say that yes I am\nkeeping to the playwright's intention but within this specific moment I can\ninterpret action A instead of action B and still be within the playwright's\nintention okay alright\n\n\nDo you all understand what I am saying\n\n\nThat once you write a play you have other elements coming in\nbecause the the actors are not machines they're not robots they're not\nprogrammed to think like you\n\n\nYou may have intended a a a certain motivation to result in a\ncertain action but uh the actor can reach that action with a different\nmotivation because they're not robots and they're not programmed by you while\nin a novel you can do exactly that because no one else is going touch your\nyour your your book\n\n\nOnce it's printed as a novel everyone reads it as it is right while\nonce a play is printed that's only part of the process", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "00d12e15-9724-411f-9b14-62e92b9686f5", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.648717+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nUhm I will be dealing with four areas\n\n\nWe'll start off with the type of materials that we've got followed\nby the system that we adopted which is basically how we classify our material\nfollowed by how we manage the centre and how we monitor students' performance\n\n\nRight we'll start off with the types of material that we've got\n\n\nUhm video tapes lots and lots of entertainment tapes actually and\nalso that keeps us growing especially since well we know that we can tape\nfrom tv okay\n\n\nSo all videos for entertainment purposes are stored in a cabinet\nover here and other educational tapes uh we have we store them at the back\ndown there\n\n\nAnd if these students think <unclear> word </unclear> on what how to\nconduct interviews how to present themselves at interviews how to write uh\nbusiness letters or reports or how to use body language more effectively okay\n\n\nUh the entertainment videos have been classified into different\ncategories\n\n\nWe've got Shakespeare and classics which are usually based on some\nliterary text rather like Gone with the Wind adventure and drama like Robin\nHood Prince of Thieves Terminator 2\n\n\nUhm we've also got uhm mysteries thrillers and documentaries Now\nunder computer materials we classified them under several categories\n\n\nWe got quite a lot of help material and uh under games we've got\nthings like scrabble and crosswords\n\n\nAssimilations we have games like uhm where in the world is town San\nDiego where you pretend to be detective and you go around the world searching\nfor information to catch a thief\n\n\nUnder skills we have uhm programmes like speed reader or spell it\n\n\nAnd uh the next one is language application Language application we\nhave a concordancer the one that was uh introduced by Longman the mini\nconcordancer which students can use\n\n\nUhm text construction uh things like gap master where students on\nthe white <unclear> word </unclear> fill in you know\n\n\nThey are given a paragraph with many blank words and then students\nwill just type in words\n\n\nIf they're correct they get a nice sound and if they don't they get\n<unclear> word </unclear> that kind of thing\n\n\nGeneral application software like pagemaker and uhm uh word\nprocessing programmes\n\n\nBooks and magazines you can see we have quite a lot of them will\ngenerally on books tend to be short stories because the students that come\nhere don't spend a lot of time\n\n\nSo we tend to buy short stories either by local writers or others\nand uhm we store in at the back over there\n\n\nThe magazines we store them here and we subscribe to four Times\nDiscover Readers' Digest and Teens to cater to a variety of taste\n\n\nThe reading column which is a display of books basically tries to\nencourage them to read the new books that we've got\n\n\nRight under audio material I must confess that we have a very very\nlimited supply\n\n\nYou can see under the pronunciation tapes uh the worksheets that\nwe've got how few we have\n\n\nBut again under educational basically they're on pronunciation and\nunder entertainment we have a few that uhm tell short stories like real dull\n<unclear> word </unclear> stories\n\n\nOkay the main bulk of our facilities are the worksheets that we've\ngot and you okay and you can see them displayed right together and <unclear>\nword </unclear> alright\n\n\nWe classify our worksheets into general and specific\n\n\nGeneral here meaning they test a variety of language areas and uhm\nspecific okay under general worksheets like reading listening they do at at 'O'\nlevel\n\n\nBasically what we mean they will test things like grammar\nvocabulary and other <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nUnder the specific worksheets we've got pronunciation vocabulary\ngrammar and special skills\n\n\nUhm the special skills include things like writing a resume writing\na business letter and under information skills students are encouraged to\nlearn how to use a thesaurus how to use a dictionary\n\n\nNow the materials that we store in the filing cabinets we uh store\nfour copies of each material okay for the students to use\n\n\nAnd don't know about copyright laws but we store four copies of\neach uhm worksheet that we've got and uh two answer sheets which we separate\nwhich we put at beside uh in the filing cabinets that which you should take a\nlook later\n\n\nThe main reason actually for this is that because we find that a\nlot of our students simply copying the answers if we put them together with\nthe worksheet\n\n\nSo it really defeated the purpose\n\n\nSo we make them actually we have to walk over there to take the\nanswer sheets so that they can use them\n\n\nOkay so now I'll come to the system we've adopted that helps us to\nclassify the materials that we got've\n\n\nWe use the two prong <unclear> word </unclear> system a vending\nsystem for the levels of difficulty and a classification system\n\n\nOkay let's look at the vending first and uh if you take a look your\nhandout page one you see a sample of how we classify students' in terms of\nwriting\n\n\nUh the best open book for listening uh speaking reading\ncomprehension and things like that so each one is separate\n\n\nOkay so if you take a look at uh page one we actually only offer\nfour levels level four to level seven based on the types of students that we\nget\n\n\nNow actually most of our students are the got like that one meh\n\n\nYou know which means they are level four possibly level five yah\n\n\nWe don't get any students who are the A one type so most our\nmaterials are concentrated on level four and five\n\n\nSo if you take a look at this you see that under level four the\nstudents should be able to write simple paragraphs without guidance\n\n\nUhm will produces <unclear> word </unclear> writing that lacks\nclarity coherence and relevance uh other than simple paragraphs okay\n\n\nWe also use a colour colson colson a colour code to help the\nstudents locate the materials easily and for us level four materials which\nare the simplest are coded yellow\n\n\nLevel five materials are coded pink uh level six materials are\ncoded blue and level seven seven materials are beige or cream\n\n\nOh under the specs the classification system that helps us to\ndetermine what area under vocabulary or grammar\n\n\nIf you take a look at page two we categorise our materials quite uh\ncomplexly\n\n\nI suppose because you'll see that the classification system we use\nis very teacher oriented and not really student oriented\n\n\nSo under vocabulary for example uhm two one four to us means\nhomonyms and uhm two three zero means affixes in general which means the\nstudents don't really know what they're looking for when they look at the\nmaterials in there unless they refer to the files on the teacher's desk\n\n\nSo if they were to just go to the vocabulary section they just flip\nout a piece of material that's numbered two three zero\n\n\nGenerally they don't really know what's it all about\n\n\nThey just read the title and it means something like uhm uh affixes\nyou know but they don't really know that that is the category for affixes and\nthere's no don't know if that's really what they want\n\n\nSo they just go in they look look whatever looks interesting and\nthen they just take it out\n\n\nSo I think that perhaps is a an area we could improve on\n\n\nOkay now the materials that we've got basically use a three prong\nsystem\n\n\nWe have an explanation sheet uhm worksheet and a answer sheet\n\n\nAnd the explanation sheet and worksheet are kept together near to\nthe filing pockets\n\n\nAll the worksheet uh sorry all the explanation sheets are beige in\ncolour\n\n\nThat's how the students pick them out\n\n\nWell if you look at page three four five and six this is a sample\nset of materials to do with equerry <unclear> word </unclear> name name four\nzero one\n\n\nAnd four zero one to us means singular and plural\n\n\nSo a student who takes out the worksheet which is from page four\nand five will see the title singular or plural and will be instruction that\nsays you name me explanation four zero one stroke one\n\n\nWell this explanation sheet like I said is found in that same\npocket go through this and just pull it out\n\n\nThey read the explanation sheet if they need to and then they do\nthe exercise alright\n\n\nBy the end of the exercises they are directed to check an answer\nsheet also follow the same number exactly as in the answer sheet five stroke\none\n\n\nOkay let me just explain the numbers\n\n\nOkay worksheet four stroke one to us means level four and the first\nworksheet produced under this level\n\n\nSo we can have worksheet four stroke two four stroke three which\nmeans that more and more worksheets have been prepared and even under the\nsame category but a level five worksheet then will start off again worksheet\nfive stroke one for explanation one zero and so on\n\n\nAlright that's how you keep track of our materials\n\n\nOkay if however it is a text which deals with reading comprehension\non the 'O' levels then the students will be directed to a text not an\nexplanation sheet okay\n\n\nThey will go right to the worksheet please take text zero zero zero\none in order for you to do this worksheet\n\n\nAll our worksheets also are tailored to under an hour so that the\nstudents don't have to spend too much time here because we're basically a\nsupplement to their main curriculum\n\n\nThey are given curriculum time to come here and sit down and\nactually work on the materials\n\n\nSo this means that they come as and when they are free and this\nusually means like lunch break or after they finish their classes\n\n\nSo they really only come when they have time and it might be just\nin between classes so the worksheets are all specifically tailored to that\n<unclear> word </unclear> alright\n\n\nOkay now how to use the self-access system itself\n\n\nAt the very beginning of our academic year all first year students\nall scheduled for a half hour visit to the centre that shows them a short\nvideo which you will watch\n\n\nAnd uhm enables them to know what is what this place where the\nplace is and also you know ask questions if they need to so that they can use\nit more effectively\n\n\nWe'll show you the short video\n\n\nOkay uhm if you take a look at the brochure you'll see that the\nsystem that the students follow is printed for you so you can look at it at\nyour own leisure\n\n\nI'm going to move on now to the management of the of the centre how\nwe take turns to make sure that the centre runs smoothly\n\n\nWell under planning of the centre we have one full-time clerical\nstaff who's stationed here from nine to five\n\n\nAnd there are six lecturers who take turns uh we schedule planning\nhours to be here from nine to five okay\n\n\nNow we get a trade-off of teaching hours if we ran the centre for\nthree hours we get a trade-off of two teaching hours which means that you\nknow is we spend a little bit more time here or you'll have to teach so much\nalright\n\n\nAlright under general supervision we manage things like the\nstudents like telling them where to put their bags and files making sure that\nthey don't steal the materials making sure that they don't vandalise they\ndon't bring in their own computer programmes to copy what we've got yah\n\n\nI mean equipment we make sure that if they want to make use the\nphotocopier they ask us for permission\n\n\nAnd uhm make sure also that they don't use the printer unless we\nspecifically give them permission to\n\n\nUhm under materials we make sure that the students return the\nmaterials correctly to the pigeon holes\n\n\nWe make sure that uh if the materials need to be filed they are\nfiled in the proper filing pockets because otherwise materials get lost all\nover the place", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6d5e7271-0564-4936-a8b7-2eb2a39eeaa1", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.649844+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nHi good morning\n\n\nUhm can you all do me a favour and stand up and stretch because I\nknow how awful it is to sit for a whole hour\n\n\nStand up oh Collin very good Collin\n\n\nOkay make sure that you're ready to loosen up because I'm going to\nshow an R(A  movie\n\n\nNow alright I was looking through your programme I think you all can\nsit down now was looking through your programme and I noticed how intensive\nit is and it's really is heavy weight subject\n\n\nSo I thought oh give these kids a break\n\n\nLet's show an R(A  movie uh sex and violence you know women being\nraped in Bosnia the Khmer Rouge killing the UN peace keepers you know\n\n\nBut I and then I was reminded that you all are below eighteen and\nthat's why I have to snipped off a lot of the sex and violence\n\n\nSo what's left is ten minute video on journalism which is about as\ngood because there's some violence in it\n\n\nSo I hope you all would enjoy it\n\n\nIt will give you an idea about what journal journalism is about and\nand later on I will uhm give you some uh uh a few tips on what takes to write\nwell in journalism okay\n\n\nWell I hope you enjoyed that show a bit of a hard sell ha\n\n\nBut I hope I think it gives you all a very good idea about what\njournalism is about and the difference worlds that you have to be very in\ntune in uhm in not only in Singapore but what's happening abroad\n\n\nWhat's happening uhm in China in Soviet Union in uhm now Russia and\nuh England anywhere\n\n\nSo what I'm going to do is uhm is to give you a micro and to a\nmacro view of the things you should be tuned in\n\n\nUhm and I think the most important thing is as journalist to be\ntuned into the written word\n\n\nIt's the tool of the trade okay\n\n\nLike uhm somebody ask me what's so creative about journalism that\nyou know you want to talk about it in the creative arts programme\n\n\nBut I think uhm like playwrights like novelists like poets we deal\nwith the written word\n\n\nUhm do you think I can have one that never mind I'm not used to\nstanding still like this\n\n\nYou can hear me\n\n\nDo I have to off this\n\n\nOkay can you hear me ya\n\n\nThose behind can you hear me\n\n\nOkay thanks okay\n\n\nUhm how do we use words to convey what you want you know what we\nobserve probably find out\n\n\nThat's where creativity comes in and I'll like to think of words\nlike so many horses you know like uhm like the poet they probably the horse\nis probably uhm the show horse where they they re-prance?? the horse around\nwith accessories you know\n\n\nThey'll groom them they're in no hurry to get to the finishing line\n\n\nUhm and the playwright and the novelist you can gallop across\nmeadows of im imagination\n\n\nYou can even make the horse fly uhm you can even help uh pimples on\nthe on the horse if you want you know\n\n\nSo in the playwright use words different and you can imagine thing\nbestow things onto people that they don't have\n\n\nUhm but for the the journalist the the word is is primary a work\nhorse\n\n\nYou have to work it real hard\n\n\nUhm you write it out only for a purpose to inform to educate to\nstimulate thought or to entertain\n\n\nThat's what journalists are for to do these four main functions\n\n\nI repeat to inform to educate to stimulate thought and to entertain\n\n\nAnd it's often a race\n\n\nYou can't afford like to meander around the meadows and uh gaze at\nthe trees and look at the stars you know\n\n\nYou just have to get to the finishing line fast or else the\nmagazines and the weeklies which are on sale are like donkeys or goats you\nknow\n\n\nThey will overtake you and it'll be very embarrassing if you're a\nnewspaper journalist\n\n\nUhm so no matter how how you love the written word no matter how\nand and many are like Collin you know\n\n\nHe's he's a journalist and he loves words the way I do and but then\nyou have to uhm subsume that love you have to be a master over your words\n\n\nYou cannot be a slave to the written word\n\n\nSo you every word must count on a page and that's where I feel\ndifferent from playwrights or fits?? a a novelist where where uhm you let\nwords take its own life\n\n\nOkay so this is one of the major challenges of uhm this journalism\n\n\nI'm not?? showing you some slides I'm very low tech\n\n\nHow do you work this\n\n\nIt took me a long time even to uhm operate my my computer\n\n\nMagic okay you know alright I think\n\n\nOkay now if if uhm if you're not sure what what count for as a\njournalist imagine if this is your front page\n\n\nYou wake up in the morning and you take a copy of the Straits Times\ntake a cup of the coffee and this is your front page and this was a front\npage of the Straits Times in 1865\n\n\nImagine reading that\n\n\nWhere do you start\n\n\nAnd what is it about\n\n\nWhere is the headline you know\n\n\nUhm and and actually they're talking about the budget you know and\nand they gives detail about uh what happen at at the budget\n\n\nBut uhm who will read it\n\n\nIf today do you think anybody buy would buy a front page like this\n\n\nSo you have to be very very tune in to society to the habits of\nyour readers to uhm what people want to read\n\n\nAnd so if you put word all over the page you are no journalist\n\n\nAh uhm another example of the front page of the Straits Times\n\n\nAren't you glad we evolved\n\n\nSo what happen here was that they put advertisements on the front\npage not information yah\n\n\nAnd it's very interesting\n\n\nI was so amuse when I was doing my research because can you can you\nsee them quite small ha\n\n\nThere's one about milk goats veer?? veer?? veer?? veer?? veer??\n\n\nThey have two gu gujerat?? milk goats with three kids all excellent\nconditions\n\n\nApply to the printer of this paper\n\n\nThey were selling goats on the front page of the Straits Times\n\n\nSo so newspapers change journalists change with the times you know\nso you have to always be on top of things and and words are are not the only\nthings that you can convey what you want to convey as a journalist\n\n\nSo you have to be tuned into the ? ? what you want the words to do\nfor you and the that doesn't mean flooding the whole front page with words\n\n\nUhm and it means giving information and not only and and not only\nadvertisements on the front page\n\n\nAnd you also have to be tuned into what's happening around you\n\n\nUhm you've to be tuned into the details of things that are\nhappening around you and to be to be a good writer in journalism it's quite\ndifferent from being a good reporter\n\n\nBut I believe that uhm to be a good writer in journal you have to\nbe a good reporter first you know\n\n\nYou you must be interested in what's happening around you\n\n\nUhm the more you the more you work to make your writing perceptive\ninsightful stimulating and moving the more you learn to write so that you can\ncapture everything that's happening around you and you present it to the\nworld you know\n\n\nYou present it to your readers to hood it up for their imagination\n\n\nBut you have to notice the mole on her cheek you have to uhm you\nhave to notice whether she she was she actually uhm she look really sad and\nthen the wrinkles that're on her eyes you know\n\n\nUhm what turn into a tight fan when she was telling you about how\nher husband died you know\n\n\nUhm uhm you have to notice uhm details like if she she tells you\nhe's a ? ? that\n\n\nOnce I I interviewed this guy who was accused of raping a girl and\nhe says no no no\n\n\nUhm I uhm he he he maintained that the gi uhm the girl agreed to\nhaving relations with him and at the end wanted to give him trouble and cried\nrape and he was sitting there saying I had sex with forty women in my whole\nlife\n\n\nHe's about forty years old and he was wearing this China T-shirt\nwith uhm made in China slippers you know and ? ? with trousers with holes and\nhe was telling me\n\n\nOh I drive a sports car and women like me because I'm like a Hong\nKong superstar you know\n\n\nAnd he was there you know with China T-shirt\n\n\nSo you have to match reality with what is being told to you and\nthat's come from being a good journalist\n\n\nYou not only hear what people are telling you but you match it with\nwhat you see\n\n\nSo you've to be very tuned in to to the details of uh the people\nyou're talking to or to the surroundings\n\n\nSo I feel that the writer sees better and more clearly than the\nnon-writer\n\n\nIf you're if you love words and I'm sure you all do being creative\npeople you find that you'd be even a better reporter if if you go there as\nsomeone who loves words\n\n\nAnd even as the event you're covering unfolds be a parliament\nsession\n\n\nYou know where I've got to sit through for six hours or a murder or\na big fire you have always to be tuned in to what's going on\n\n\nYou must be thinking about how to write you know\n\n\nYou can't like sit down and said well switch off and then I'll I'll\nget codes later on and I'll come back to the office and I'll just it'll come\nit'll come you know\n\n\nIt doesn't work that way\n\n\nYou have to think on your feet you know\n\n\nEven as ministers let's say are giving their speeches in parliament\nthen you have to be consciously thinking what are the points he's making\n\n\nIs he worth any space you know uh what's his argument is it\n\n\nIs it valid if it's you know false?? and and you must know as good\nwriters you must know that writing is more than putting words on a page\n\n\nGood writing is a process of observing digesting thinking and\nexplaining\n\n\nUhm and for for for features you must think in terms of not only\nof writing but you must also think in terms of from one thought to the other\n\n\nAnd you have to think in terms of endings as well as the headings\n\n\nHow you start the story what we call intro\n\n\nYou must also think in terms of the endings\n\n\nThe endings give a sense of completion to the reader\n\n\nI'll give an example of a recent feature I did just publish\nyesterday\n\n\nUhm it was about old folk's homes\n\n\nUhm their they're they take up a whole floor of a HDB block and\nnow they're expanding to a second floor you know and lives?? in Ang Mio Kio\n\n\nAnd I'm sure you all know about the case in Dover Park hospice you\nknow and uhm the St Andrew Hospital for the elderly where the all the\nneighbours made a lot of noise about having these old people nearby\n\n\nThey think they're sick and dying\n\n\nNo we don't want to catch their uhm their diseases you know\n\n\nThey don't want to be expose to death when they're so young in\ntheir prime of health\n\n\nUhm so with this new expansion of this elderly in this HDB block\nin Ang Mio Kio", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "305ffca7-0788-4919-bfba-0ddfb51601c9", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.650943+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nWhat I like to do now is to take you through from the world of\nuh the literary uh\n\n\nYou know from authorship to the fairly realistic pragmatic world and\nuh basically what I'll like to talk about is bridging the world between uh\nyou know where authors are books the creative uh industry with you know uh\nearning your bread and butter and getting that done\n\n\nUh so being quite consistent with Singapore's thrust towards\nentrepreneurship uh in a pushing towards uh you know enterprise uh at the\nsame time\n\n\nNow first of all about the book itself\n\n\nThe travels of Wiglinton and Wenks are really to help promote\neducational values among the children who are reading it particularly\ngeography\n\n\nSo the first four books of the series cover the first book is on\nLondon and Paris\n\n\nAlright so it covers the uh travel taste of uh the adventures of Wi\nWiglinton and Wenks in London and Paris\n\n\nThe next one is on Venice and Rome\n\n\nThe third one is one is on Istanbul and Turkey and the fourth is\nMalta and Singapore and the fifth will be on China called the China doll\n\n\nAnd the reason why I'm covering uh these various countries with you\nis it because if you can find a programme or a book that uh you know provides\nyou with uh opportunities on travel this would be a lovely business to be in\nand that's the business\n\n\nWe're in because in anyway in order for us to be able to the the\nbooks and to have them uh drawn all three of us have got to travel uh and do\nresearch\n\n\nSo the first thing about bridging worlds uh in terms of writing is\nthe fact that you've got to go into research which is partly you know facts\n\n\nThat's what faction is all about in you know\n\n\nIn whatever documents you come up with whatever books or essays you\nintent to write and have to write you've got to do the fundamental research\n\n\nAnd in this case it is really pleasurable because you've got to go\nvisit the countries and the cities\n\n\nAnd you've got to get the very good feel of uh the facts and you've\ngot to get them right\n\n\nBecause otherwise you know children will be picking up all the\ninaccurate information\n\n\nSo let's put it this way\n\n\nThe reason why it is uh geared for six to a hundred is because if\nyou've never been to Turkey and uh you've not been to Istanbul\n\n\nIf you were to read the book you would get very good facts about\nthe culture of the countries that you're uh that the books are all about\n\n\nYou'll get lovely illustrations of uh some of the major uh things\nwhich are in the city and the country\n\n\nSo the research is really to provide stimulus for writing because\nyou can't live in a isolation\n\n\nIf I were to put you a square box in a room on your own and expect\nyou create out of nothing\n\n\nIt's is often very difficult\n\n\nUh on the other hand by interacting with people by being here for\ninstance and having spend a week uh talking to your peers and talking to\nspeakers\n\n\nPerhaps and having an exchange you get the stimulus you need often\nto get your work done\n\n\nSecondly nothing uh you know it's better than getting a feel of\nthis of the situation\n\n\nIf you're writing about uh in a cultures about people uh there is\nnothing more im important than getting a feel of the situation the climate\n\n\nWhat are the attitudes like you know\n\n\nHow do people feel about the country\n\n\nHow do they feel in terms of uh the the kind of celebrations that\nthey have and what's the joy they get uh in these places\n\n\nOr perhaps some of the problems that they're experiencing\n\n\nThe third of course is to make it authentic because one of the key\nthings about writing uh and about you know function is you got to provide a\ncertain basis for which people can identify with with the the things which\nare being done\n\n\nSo it's a very nice uh fin final balance between reading a book for\ninstance the book on Turkey\n\n\nIf a Turk uh were to read it and uh for instance the ambassador of\nTurkey were to read this book\n\n\nHe should be able to say yes it is quite accurate it is quite\nauthentic uh there's no thrill you know uh uhm bull-shiting around with the\nfacts\n\n\nHowever one of the key things also is you got to realise that if\nyou're writing children's books you are actually writing also the positive\nside\n\n\nSo one of the key things you might say to yourself is that if\nyou've got nothing really nice to say about something don't say it\n\n\nNow that's the position of censorship which I think is interesting\ngiven this audience\n\n\nBecause I'm sure one can go into a debate about whether censorship\nuh you know is right or wrong\n\n\nI realise you've had Irene Ng from the the Straits Times before as\na speaker\n\n\nI don't know what she's covered but uh you know people would I\nthink think in terms of what is the role of censorship or self censorship in\na country uh like ours\n\n\nAnd one of the key things I would say is this that if you are\nlooking into writing about cross-cultures you've got to be responsible\n\n\nAnd when I talk about responsible authorship I'm saying you have to\nbe sensitive about the multi-right racial elements in any societies\n\n\nUh they're other countries with different religions\n\n\nYou've got the multireligious states\n\n\nYou have also got a a lot of different cultures\n\n\nAnd because of this sensitivities you've got to I think be\nresponsible which means sometimes you've got tell yourself that uh you know\nif you have nothing nice about it don't say it\n\n\nUh and you know uh do that\n\n\nAnd you've also got to bear in mind that the product meets the\nobjectives and reinforces the value you are trying to promote\n\n\nFor example if you look at uh what's happening in Turkey Turkey is\nessentially uh uh Islamic country\n\n\nI mean Islam is the major uh you know religion in Turkey\n\n\nSo you've got to be very careful in the way you protray the mosque\n\n\nMake sure that they're accurate\n\n\nMake sure that uh you know you give enough uhm uhm recognition to\nuh you know the uhm religion uh of the countries\n\n\nUh in Maltar which is very very Catholic you'll find lots of\nillustrations about you know Catholicism the cathedrals the festives and the\nfestivals that they celebrate\n\n\nSimilarly in Rome you've got vatican so you cover that as well\n\n\nAnd I'm saying that when you're dealing with sensitive uh issues on\nreligion and races and the different cultures you've got to be very wary\n\n\nIn Singapore for instane you see uh one of the sketches about\nRajagopal\n\n\nNow Rajagopal is called the wise one and he's the one in little\nIndia who helps Wiglinton and Wenks uh find out where the clue to the next\nmap in Singapore is\n\n\nAnd in Singapore because of the multi-racial system you will find\nthat in the book uh you we've represented all the races\n\n\nYou've got the Chinese you know you got the Eurasian manager of the\nOrchid factory\n\n\nYou've also got the uhm you know uh Malay inspector who help them\nto interpret the clue\n\n\nSo these are all some of the things you have to bear in mind when\nyou are writing for the world stage\n\n\nAnd I think the important thing to bear in mind is this\n\n\nThe justification I think for self-censorship is really to look at\nwhat is the objective you are trying to achieve\n\n\nAnd may if you're going to write on something else you know\nsomething different uh you may uh then decide to be less strict with yourself\nas far as that's concern\n\n\nBut I think given the kind of objectives that you are trying to to\nmove in the product and the kind of values you're gonna try and promote in in\nterms of uh you know green heritage uh preservation non-violence\n\n\nThese are some of the things that you got to bear in mind when\nyou're writing\n\n\nAnd I welcome questions and we all welcome questions after this on\non the point of uh contention I think\n\n\nRight coming back to bridges\n\n\nI think one of the key things uh in taking this dimension of uh the\nprogrammme further is to take a look at the products and the services that\nyou will be producing\n\n\nFor example many of you will be writing short story\n\n\nHopefully you would like to publish your own books one day or even\npublish uh script for a play\n\n\nOne of the thing you got to then uhm begin to bridge is the\nliterary world of the author with the world of commerce which is the reader\nwhich is how do you get your product which is the book or the play and the\nservice which is educational one assumes or exposure of stimulus\n\n\nWhatever it is uh that you define as the objective to the end\nreader is the end user or the consumer\n\n\nHow do you get the actual product into the hands of the person\n\n\nWho's going to buy hopefully the product and therefore in terms of\nwhat bridges you got to look at two views\n\n\nThe publishing first of all getting the book into print and out on\nthe table and the marketing and public relations and promotion uh you know\ninvolve\n\n\nWhere publishing is concerned I think many of you would tend to\nhave uh uh come to a decision point whether you are going to raise or the\nfinance yourself\n\n\nUh and therefore have the money yourself to put behind getting the\nbooks into print and publishing it which means you've got uh ultimately uh\ncontrol of uh the what goes into the book\n\n\nYou don't have to go through uhm such a tough editing process from\na publishing houses\n\n\nYou'll find I mean obviously you need editors to go through your\nbooks to make sure that they are readable and in a readable state\n\n\nBut you could decide to finance yourself and go ahead and publish\nthe books\n\n\nOn the other hand like many other writers if you can't afford to do\nthat you got to then approach publishing houses\n\n\nAnd in Singapore one of the nicest things is that there the\npublishing trade is actually now quite open\n\n\nAnd some of the people who I think have been on this programme are\nactually supporting local authors\n\n\nAnd I think the trade is uh really growing so you could submit your\nscripts to the publishing houses and they will normally come back to you and\nnegotiate around what should be edited in what should be edited out what's is\nsell sell sellable etcetera\n\n\nSo that's really the decision point you have to make in terms of\npublishing\n\n\nWhere marketing is concern that's the entrepreneurship\n\n\nMany authors tend to just say I've done my job I've written the\nbook it's now with the publishers it's in in just the basic form and that's\nit you know\n\n\nAnd uh leave the marketing and public relations very much to chance\n\n\nOr sometimes if they have a good publisher the publisher would\nnormally organise you know the launch party the uhm press release etcetera\n\n\nSo this very much depends on how active one wants want one wants to\nbe\n\n\nBut one of the key things uh that you know that we are thinking and\nand sharing with you is that you may have to think public relations\n\n\nYou may have to think promotions and you may have to get down into\nthe market to actually get your books going", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "90e37af6-c649-44f0-9b76-b8a2897d20e2", "added":

? this uh\nstress at the moment okay\n\n\nSo this one uh is going to then you look at the outcome uh what you\nexpect of the outcome\n\n\nUh you think it's going to be a good outcome or bad outcome\n\n\nSo probably you know we do that lah most of the time but probably\nwe don't have it in a structure\n\n\nBut you generally like some sort of expectation\n\n\nI think it's terrible suppose to be collapsing soon uh I will not\nbe able to survive it and then it's going to be so bad I think I better end\nmy life\n\n\nSo that will become someone expecting the worse outcome\n\n\nWell you think well perhaps it's not so bad that type of thing then\nuhm you look at the you know efficacy of expectations uh whether you think\nyou know how efficacious uh certain things are going to be\n\n\nYou know what strategies what you're going use and whether it's\ngoing to be useful or not\n\n\nAnd the commitments that you have uhm in relation to that stress\n\n\nUh what commitments do you have to that situation and that will\nhelp you decide you know\n\n\nBecause your options are going to give them what commitment you\nhave\n\n\nIf you are overly committed or heavily committed then you may be\nable to you may be unable to you know have the option of leaving that stress\nor that stressful situation\n\n\nNow other things will be on your personality and here a lot of work\nhas been done\n\n\nSo uhm you all may have heard of the type A and type B type of\npersonality\n\n\nThere has been a lot of work done and initially it was use you know\n\n\nAlmost about uh two three decades ago about you know cardiac\ndisorders you know cardiac disorders and the type A type of personality\n\n\nSo that you know it was represented with a clench fist and a and a\nstopwatch uh\n\n\nIf they say those who are most prone to mild cardiac problems lah\nuh let's say infarctions heart attacks and all that\n\n\nThey're the ones who are very very tense\n\n\nThey're very ambitious they are very impatient and uh they have to\ndo things all the time on the go\n\n\nAnd that's why you have this clench fist and suggesting a lot of\ntension inner tension and also the stop watch\n\n\nA stop watch has seen a lot of Singaporeans and a stop watch in\ntheir minds that means everything must be done on time\n\n\nIf the thing is a bit slow uhm certain things happen they become\nvery frustrated and they're very uptight about it\n\n\nSo this is the type A personality and it was found that within type\nA personality you are prone to uhm cardiac problems\n\n\nBut now in the whole context has been widen so that they look at\nthis personality and gastric ulcer this personality and a lot of variety of\nthings\n\n\nSo basically if you do have that part if you can uh then you can\nchange it uh preferably to the type B personality\n\n\nType B is the opposite of it\n\n\nYou're very laid back you don't care till you know sky can come\ndown and say well it's not too bad and all that\n\n\nSo gives him a very laid back type of personality and probably in\nterms of the Singapore context\n\n\nIf you're too type B again I suppose it's not too good\n\n\nOkay but anyway this is the personality type that you have and the\nother one is the locus of control again\n\n\nA lot of work has been done\n\n\nWell this uh control basically means that a situation happens how\nmuch are you in control of it\n\n\nCan you control or you can't control it\n\n\nOkay whether let's say uhm examinations can you control the outcome\nor not\n\n\nGenerally I think where exams are concerned ah we have quite a good\nlocus of control\n\n\nBasically I mean if you have uhm let's say sufficient you have the\nintellectual level and you know you know you study hard and you go through\nthe past question\n\n\nYour chances of passing should be about ninety per cent\n\n\nThere'll be ten per cent chance of failing\n\n\nYou may not do you may not reach A but your chances of passing are\ngood\n\n\nSo your locus of control is good\n\n\nBut suppose you know you go into a situation where the external\nlocus of your control is an external locus of control\n\n\nThat means you're working in a situation where you have a very\nerratic boss everything depends on him\n\n\nHe's very high-sailing but he's very erratic and you don't know\nwhere you stand you have to look at the face\n\n\nOne day he's happy the other day he's not\n\n\nSo he gives you that type of stress it can be very bad\n\n\nI think of some people those who have been in the army sometimes\nyou know you face uh uh a difficult ? ?\n\n\nHe may give you hell because you may not be able to predict\n\n\nIt's totally out of your control\n\n\nSo in that situation you can feel very helpless and the stress can\nbe great\n\n\nAnd another thing at the end a lot of work being done on social\nsupport\n\n\nWhat we know is that the more support you have the better you are\nable to cope\n\n\nSo let's say now the stressor you go through this and then you look\nat your coping strategies ah\n\n\nThere are different types of coping strategies\n\n\nOne is problem focus one is emotion focus\n\n\nWe'll go through the strategies later and that depends your outcome\ndepends on that\n\n\nIf it's a bad outcome you will get your either psychological\nproblem uh into well I was talking suicidal behaviour and all that\n\n\nAnd even you know while it was mention sexual disorders uhm you can\nget physical problems\n\n\nAnd physical problems can be anything because uh lots of things are\nactually in a way the relationship between strength and ailment\n\n\nThere are several what we call psychosomatic disorders\n\n\nThat means you're quite related to stress and others which are a\nbit more diffused ah\n\n\nBut again a lot of work is being done on that\n\n\nOr if you have been all these factors are good then your outcome\ncan be satisfactory\n\n\nRight so this is uh a basic uhm outcome of the concept of stress\n\n\nAnd now we will go straight into the management strategy\n\n\nI shall be dealing you know with uh two of these and not all of\nthem\n\n\nNow these are the general ones as in relaxation hypnosis and\nimagery and tonight\n\n\nI would like to cover it and then later on we go onto the more\ncognitive ones\n\n\nHow do you change your way of thinking\n\n\nSo the first one is uh is relaxation therapy and uhm perhaps you\nknow if you can do now can you all shift around uh so that you have enough\nspace uh to be able to stick your legs out\n\n\nNow the issue of relaxation therapy is that you know you have to\nlearn how to relax and you have to relax your muscles ah\n\n\nSo this one is what we call the peripheral method meaning that you\nknow the theory is that if your muscles are relaxed you're going to be able\nto relax okay\n\n\nSome people will find that you know it is so if they relax muscles\nthen they can relax themselves\n\n\nBut some people may not be able to do that and that's why we have\nyou know different other techniques later on\n\n\nOkay so initially this was started by Jacobson?? in the nineteen\nthirties\n\n\nAnd uh what he said was like I said the principle was that if you\nrelax your muscles then your whole mind will relax\n\n\nMany people find that they cannot tell whether their muscles are\ntense or relax lah\n\n\nSo what we did was have a series of exercises which focus uh on\ntension that allow you to then you know\n\n\nWhat it means when your muscles are tense and what that means when\nyour muscles are relaxed\n\n\nSo what I shall do is now I would like all of you to now just\ntense your muscles really grip hard and tense everything clench you know\nclench your your legs\n\n\nAnd then your hands and bite as you know really hard really hard\n\n\nAnd as you do that focus fully on your body focus on the tension\nof your legs your arms your teeth and all that really tense tense tense tense\n\n\nNow relax just relax and as you relax just focus on your muscles\n\n\nHow it feels when they are relaxed\n\n\nSo this one is very important because this is uh something you got\nto learn about your body\n\n\nHow it feels ah to be tense and how it feels to be relaxed\n\n\nWhat I shall do is to go through the whole series and what we'll\nbe doing is to tense and relax you know different muscle groups\n\n\nAs you tense and relax just focus on that part and don't tense or\nrelax the other parts\n\n\nSo if I say the feet ah just tense your feet and so on and so\ndon't just focus on that \n\n\nAnd uh try to get a system because obviously this is something if\nyou want to use you've got to practice lah", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ba45e5c7-2769-410e-8f15-e8ca3c5d139a", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.653135+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nWe had a special viewing session in the museum last night for\nsome very special people\n\n\nSo they were going through the whole of museum from one room to\nanother gallery and so on\n\n\nAnd at the end of this whole tour there was going to be a reception\nfor them in the conference room\n\n\nThere will be drinks there will be cakes and so on\n\n\nSo there was this show known as Mo Tau the Ink Paintings in\nSingapore that was right before the conference room\n\n\nAfter walking through the whole museum the whole group just went\npast the whole exhibition just because there was food at the end of it\n\n\nAnd that's quite natural and your lunch time is like uh what\nthirty-five minutes from now and you must be happy\n\n\nSo we should keep to just thirty-five minutes and uh hopefully you\nknow we can uh go through with\n\n\nAnd I'm interested in having a dialogue discussion with you more\nthan anything else because I understand that you're a group of writers are\nyou not\n\n\nAnd I do not know how much you're interested in art\n\n\nI was saying I do not know how much are you all are interested in\nart\n\n\nUh I certainly hope to use this use this very short uh session that\nI have with you to talk about at what points we can cross-reference art\nhistory and literal history and what kind of inspirations that you know\n\n\nAgain art could draw from writing and writing could draw from the\nvisual arts\n\n\nUh the talk that I'm going to have is called Art And Identity: Ink\nPainting In Singapore\n\n\nI gave this title over a long-distance phone call and somebody\ndecided to be creative along the way and to add the word creative which makes\nno identity\n\n\nBut it is art and identity and not necessarily a creative identity\n\n\nUhm the the point is uh I'm I'm giving this talk in conjunction\nwith the current exhibition that we have at the National Museum the one that\nI mention Mo Tau uh Ink Paintings in Singapore\n\n\nUhm uh ink paintings or you all might better know the medium as\nChinese paintings then again whether these paintings are Chinese is a point\nof contention\n\n\nYou know this is precisely some of the things that we could discuss\nabout\n\n\nUh it is better to use the more technical term ink painting as in\nas in the ink medium\n\n\nUh the exhibition that we are having tries to capture to talk about\nin particular history in particular development of this medium of paintings\nin Singapore over the past fourteen years or so\n\n\nThe actually I'm keen to find out are you all interested in art at\nthis pace\n\n\nDo do you all like paintings\n\n\nYes no no sorry uh okay okay okay\n\n\nOkay uh we may say that the beginning of art in Singapore I mean we\ndo this for reasons of writing an art history of Singapore as the point when\nNanyang Academy of Fine Arts was establish in 1938\n\n\nHave you heard of Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts which is a art\nschool well-known art school uh very established art school in Singapore\n\n\nNow this school was established in 1938\n\n\nAnd when the school was established it was modelled after similar\nart academies in Shanghai in China Shanghai was then the arts centre of Shang\nuh of of China in the 1950s\n\n\nNow if you go back further back into Chinese uh history twentieth\ncentury history uh you'll you'll you'll recall that you know early twentieth\ncentury late nineteenth century was the point when the Chinese learned along\nfrom the West\n\n\nAnd they got this a lot of Western technology Western ideas and so\non and try to integrate this Western uh technologies and idea with Chinese\ntradition\n\n\nSo when the art academies were establish in Shanghai in the\ntwenties and thirties they had uh basically two departments\n\n\nOne is known as Chinese ink painting the other one is xiyang hua or\nWestern art\n\n\nAnd the two departments could never really integrate because to\nbegin with we're talking about very different uhm uh artistic uhm uh\ntraditions at artistic or aesthetic traditions\n\n\nAnd same as for Singapore when it came to Singapore\n\n\nWhen this moder of art academy came to Singapore in the late 1930s\nNanyang Academy of Fine Arts also started with two departments The Chinese\npainting department the Western painting department\n\n\nEven up to today you know this uh dichotomy is still very\nproblematical\n\n\nNow in this exhibition we're organising we try to look at the\nhistory of Singapore art just plan from the view of a single medium ink\npainting\n\n\nAnd uh in doing so we try to see how by looking from this point of\nview by looking specifically from this perspective what kind of questions we\ncan generate\n\n\nWhat kind of issues\n\n\nWhat kind of discussions we can generate in discuss in talking\nabout the history of art in Singapore\n\n\nSo uh have the Nanyang style\n\n\nHave you heard of this term\n\n\nUh do some of you do art major are are you doing art as a paper in\nyour 'A' level\n\n\nYou are just writers and nothing else\n\n\nOkay okay uh okay let me see how I should say this\n\n\nThere was a group of artists in the early 1950s uh namely uh Chen\nWenxi Zong Sutien uh Cheng chon Cheng Chong Swee and Liu Kan who went for a\nfield trip in Bali in 1952 uh specifically\n\n\nSo during this trip they captured many of the Balinese sceneries\nBalinese culture people and so on\n\n\nAnd this field trip that they made in the in 1950 uh in the early\n1950s when they came back they actually uh a new genre of painting known as\nNanyang style\n\n\nBasically they integrated Chinese ink with Western methods of ink\npainting and using Balinese subject matters\n\n\nIn the 70s and 80s when we started talking looking at our own art\nhistory when Singapore started looking started looking our own art history we\nthen identified the Nanyang style of the 1950s as our first art movement\n\n\nSo you know this is a fairly nationalistic uh retrospective of our\nown art history and we were searching for an art movement that we could call\nour own\n\n\nIs like the Americans calling the abstract expressionism as the\nAmerican the beginning of American art you know\n\n\nAmerica finally became independent culturally from their European\ncounterparts and started its own uh artistic movement\n\n\nSo same as for Singapore in the seventies and eighties we started\nconsidering Nanyang style as our own\n\n\nAt the same time uh new arty younger artist who studied at Nanyang\nAcademy of Fine Arts in the late sixties in the early seventies and so on\nstarted doing their fine arts studies abroad\n\n\nSo some went to London some went to New York and so on uh others\nwent to Paris\n\n\nSo when they came back they brought uh brought back with them many\nnew ideas especially about uh abstract expressionism internationalist\nartistic directions\n\n\nSo in the seventies and eighties the whole discussion of visual\narts in Singapore was very much uh uh at two ends of the spectum\n\n\nOn the one hand you have the nationalistic approach to look at\nNanyang style as in the art movement in Singapore\n\n\nAnd on the other hand you you have the internationalist approach to\nlook at international trend from America and so on as a international art\nstyle which we should have\n\n\nThe ink painters in the meantime you know this this group of people\ncontinued to paint paint in the traditional ink media\n\n\nNow even the word traditional is questionable because some of them\nactually evolve you know from the traditional approach to ink to to be more\ninnovative and to do new things and so on\n\n\nUh they found themselves being caught in in a awkward position\nbecause they were not internationalist uh painters in the sense of doing\nabstract art\n\n\nAnd they were also not nationalist painters in the sense of doing??\nNanyang style art\n\n\nThey were traditionalist painters yes uh by association of the ink\nmedium regurgitation of Chinese painting\n\n\nHowever because Singapore continued uh to have exchanges with China\nafter the end of cultural revolution in China\n\n\nSo many Chinese artist from mainland China came to Singapore they\nsold their works in Singapore\n\n\nAnd many buyers of art in Singapore collectors by virtue of this\nartist coming from mainland China\n\n\nThey were taught to be more Chinese or more uh authentic than the\nlocal ink painters\n\n\nSo it was a period for them it was a very low key period because\nthey were neither here nor there\n\n\nYou know they could not find themselves uh a niche in the\nnationalist uh paradigm they could find themselves in position in the\ninternationally uh outlook\n\n\nUh they could not find themselves even a position in the\ntraditionalist approach to art\n\n\nSo this is when National Museum uh our task at the museum is always\nto research to interpret present the art history of Singapore\n\n\nNot in any simplistic manner but always we try to show the picture\nas complex as we can in order to be as true to the actual development as we\ncan\n\n\nAnd hence we put together this exhibition to show that uh in any\ndevelopment of visual arts and I'm sure it should be the same for writing for\nthe literaly history\n\n\nUh we have to be very careful about using any simplistic uh\nschematisation of looking at the developments\n\n\nBut we always have to see the actual reality of a very complex\npicture of a very diverse picture of development\n\n\nUhm now I'm just going to talk a little bit about identity because\nthe development of Singapore art has a lot to do with the identity of\nSingaporean Chinese\n\n\nNow I'm not saying that the museum is only interested in Chinese\nart of course\n\n\nBut we happen to be dealing with this topic as this point\n\n\nAnd you know we are also interested for instant uh next year we are\nhaving an exhibition on Indonesian art and so on\n\n\nSo we're always interested in looking at things from other ethnic\ngroups' point of a view\n\n\nWhen a why you know the question here is\n\n\nWhy is Chen Wenxi Chong Cheng Chong Swee uh Chen Suying and Liu Kan\ngo to Bali in the early fifties and why did they start a Nanyang style\n\n\nUh we argue in the current exhibition that one way of looking at\nthis is to go back again to China to Shanghai in the 1920s and 30s\n\n\nBecause after the May fourth uh movement in Shan in China uh what\nwas really introduced to the visual arts education in China was Western\nrepresentational painting or naturalistic painting or or representation\n\n\nSorry I mean or uh realist painting\n\n\nAt the point when you know of course uh this was a period of\njudaism it was it was a period of phobism?? and so on\n\n\nWhen when the West began to be more interested in abstract\npaintings\n\n\nBut what the Chinese learn from the West they were really more\ninterested in realism for very specific historical reasons\n\n\nBecause artist were intellectuals and they wanted to communicate\nwith the public at large\n\n\nAnd therefore the best means to do so is through the medium of\nrepresentational painting\n\n\nSo this you know in China later on we have people like Shi Feihong\nand so on who establish art schools in in a art schools\n\n\nAnd also uh specific painting styles to integrate Chinese ink\npaintings and Western art\n\n\nAnd in Singapore in a way the Nanyang style is a later development\nof this early culture renaissance in China in the early twentieth century\n\n\nThat's one way of looking at it\n\n\nSo in a way the Nanyang style was part of the May fourth impulse\nthat finally develop into a kind of uhm uh South-east Asian Chinese art that\nstarted off with with the inspiration of the early twentieth century", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "1f55b086-cdac-4361-8f7c-cca3526635bf", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nA little bit more of myself yah\n\n\nSo yah this proves you all that I know what I am talking about\n\n\nUhm basically a newspaper is a eighteen hour operation everyday\n\n\nSo uhm you can't expect one person to work the whole eighteen hours\nand that's why I'm called the night news editor\n\n\nBecause there's a transition period uhm from between two and four\no'clock every evening when someone takes over the day day editor's work\n\n\nAnd that's when I come in and probably stay through till about\ntwelve every night to get the pages and stories out\n\n\nOkay reason why I pick the Newmen's English is that I notice uh many\npeople like you and uh got flair for the language skills good command good\ncommand of it\n\n\nBut uh when you come into a newsroom situation uhm you find it a\nlittle difficult to adapt to what a newspaper demands\n\n\nA newspaper demands something that's totally different from writing\nyour novels your poems and what have you\n\n\nAnd I notice that there's been a normally it takes students between\ntwo to three months before they get the hang of writing for a newspaper\n\n\nSo I thought I pick this and just let you all know what it takes\nand uh give you an idea of the skill that uhm writing for a newspaper\nrequires\n\n\nAnd uh don't bother taking down notes because I've made a whole set\nof uhm notes knowing uh how fastidious uh students at the moment are in\ntaking notes\n\n\nSo I made a whole set and I'll distribute them to you later okay\n\n\nNow I also got few uhm two exercises and depending on time we'll do\neither one or both of them later on\n\n\nThey just just to give give you a feel of what what it is\n\n\nOkay Newmens's English\n\n\nNow this will give you an overview of what it means\n\n\nThis was uhm from a famous book by Harold Evans who wrote a series\nof Harold Evans is the former editor of the London Times and the Sunday Times\nokay\n\n\nNow he came across this sign and he thought to himself that's just\nthree words too much and basically what what we do as newspaper man is keep\nit as short and simple as possible\n\n\nSo uhm going to this sold fish\n\n\nYou don't need to see fresh say fresh because uhm like he says\nthere he no one will sell tell you that they're selling stale fish to you\n\n\nThey don't have to say sold because you're not gonna <unclear> word\n</unclear> give that away and you don't have to say here because you would'nt\nbe doing it at home would you\n\n\nOkay so basically what we all need here is just fish right\n\n\nThat's that's the essence of uh writing for newspaper\n\n\nKeep that as short and simple as possible\n\n\nFirst of all because your reader is not gonna have a lot of time\nfor you\n\n\nOn average a a newspaper reader spend between fifteen and twenty\nminutes reading them which means you got that's not hardly enough even for\nthe ads\n\n\nOkay do you want to read a paper from cover to cover it takes you\nat least three hours\n\n\nAnd most people don't have that kind of time\n\n\nThey take twenty minutes every day just grasp at the headlines and\nand and basically just have an idea of what the newspaper is saying\n\n\nAnd also because the the newpaper has to complete with other things\nlike TV you see\n\n\nIt's much easier to turn on the TV and watch CNN or SBC news or BBC\nnews and just not think\n\n\nReading requires some effort okay so that's what we do basically\n\n\nOkay from time to time I'll put up some quotations on on the\nsubject on famous journalist writers and uh editors because just to uh spice\nthings up a little\n\n\nOkay I think a lot of people are concern about the style of writing\nyou know\n\n\nYou want to be colourful you want to do this you want to do that\nand you forget that you know you're not writing for yourselves you're writing\nfor your reader\n\n\nSo basically have something to say and say it clearly\n\n\nThat means most of the time using the most simple words available\nso that is the core skill of journalism your your language\n\n\nYou need to have that kind of language not not five syllable word\nnot seven syllable words one two syllable words keep it simple\n\n\nOf course that varies from newpaper to newpaper\n\n\nThe Newpaper for instance has a totally different style from the\nfrom the Straits Times okay\n\n\nBecause the Newpaper generally pitch at a younger audience who are\nyou know grammar maybe it's not what it should be or or even hasn't gotten\nthere yet\n\n\nAnd on the other hand Business Times is pitch at much higher\naudience than the Straits Times\n\n\nSo they use or verbose language\n\n\nOkay what does good news writing requires\n\n\nLanguage is specific conferring and concise sentences which are\nclear at first glance\n\n\nIf someone has to read a sentence twice then you've already lost\nhim or her okay\n\n\nPreference for sentences in the active voice basically telling\nstories so you need to communicate clearly to the reader\n\n\nNo one wants to see the what past tense and you know things like\nthat that just make it boring for everybody else\n\n\nAnd assertive sentences I've given two examples here\n\n\nDon't say the project was not successful just say it was a failure\nokay\n\n\nCan can everybody see from the back\n\n\nNow a lot of people have the preference for this kind of thing\nespecially uh uhm public relations officers and uh civil servants\n\n\nThey think that the more words you use the the better it comes\nacross\n\n\nAnd it it can be more authoritative if you read a a sentence that\nsays the project was not successful\n\n\nAnd you tend to get a a feeling that the writer is trying to say\nsomething important right because you're using you're using more words\n\n\nBut for a newspaper just keep it simple\n\n\nJust say the project failed\n\n\nYah every every word has to add something to a sentence so you just\nit's basically economy of the language\n\n\nWe we don't want yah we call a spade a spade why call it the factor\nof production\n\n\nFirst of all you'll have your average reader wondering what you're\ntalking about and secondly yah uses two more words than just saying a spade\n\n\nAn abstraction should be preceded by a particle now the the the\nnewsmen's uh aim is basically to simplify everything for his reader\n\n\nSo don't say that so and so brought a piece of property which is\ntwenty hectares like a large for twenty millions dollars\n\n\nThat doesn't mean anything okay so that's why we always if we\nnotice if we we read our stories we talk about land or something we always\nhave something like football field if twenty hectares\n\n\nHow many football fields is that fifteen you know\n\n\nStraight away you have an idea of what fifteen how big fifteen\nfootball fields are rather than twenty hectares which can be as big as this\nroom or you know even smaller no one\n\n\nI mean that's just makes your reader think and you and you don't\nwant to him you know competing between a dictionary and the story that you've\nwritten\n\n\nSo try to make it as close as to TV as possible if you want to put\nit that way\n\n\nAnd this is the big problem use editors to define not daunt many\npeople have uh\n\n\nI've got some examples later you know news editors like they were\ngoing out of style meaning meaningless modifiers that's what that's basically\nthe same thing\n\n\nWatch for meaning you'll to say it clearly and precisely because\nyou want to tell your reader what exactly you're you're saying rather than\nagain had him go and figure out whether you know is he talking about this or\nis he talking about something else\n\n\nSo that's that's where precise language comes in\n\n\nAvoid cliches I think you see them all the time in our sports pages\nand things like that\n\n\nSo maybe the message hasn't gotten through yet\n\n\nOkay once is enough twice is re <unclear> word </unclear> three\ntime is a felony\n\n\nUse uhm terms sparingly don't don't use the same thing over and\nover again until it becomes boring staccato to the reader okay\n\n\nHere are some example to what I'm talking about I think they speak\nfor themselves lah\n\n\nEvery word must add to a sentence\n\n\nYou would have everybody running for a dictionary and wondering\nwhat exactly he meant uhm same goes on\n\n\nThe adjectives favourites of uh many of our interns students who\ncome and work for us during the holidays and things like that they like to do\nthings like that split second of eerie silence the thunderous roars\n\n\nOkay roars are always thunderous if they weren't they weren't\ncouldn't be called roars yah\n\n\nYah modifiers rather unique you know people will always like to say\nOh he's rather nice\n\n\nShe's rather pretty\n\n\nThe lecture was rather unique\n\n\nIt's either unique or it isn't\n\n\nAnd that's there's another example\n\n\nSomeone scald scalded by hot water\n\n\nIf it was cold water you wouldn't have been scalded\n\n\nAnd there's some examples of cliches at the bottom\n\n\nSo that basically is uh the language that you that people want to\nwrite for newspaper or write for newspaper should use\n\n\nNow I go on to news stories and uh how how they should written and\nokay I give you about five minutes to read the first paragraph to see if you\ncan figure it out\n\n\nOkay one of the good example is the bottom one\n\n\nThe top one is uh totally <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nCharles Dicken's example uh by the time you get to the fifth word\nyou're already saying oh forget it\n\n\nI'm not I'm not going to bother with the rest of it\n\n\nThe other one on the other hand fifteen words and tells you the\nwhole story right\n\n\nSo introductions are the first one or two paragraphs that tell you\nnew stories\n\n\nWe call them intros for short\n\n\nAmerican newspapers call them leads\n\n\nWe're more towards the British style so we call them intros right\n\n\nThe first two paragraphs of every story is the most important part\nof the story\n\n\nNow you have to use your intro to grab the reader\n\n\nIf a reader looks at your intro and says this is boring he is not\ngoing to read the rest of the story okay\n\n\nI think they carry out surveys on various US newspapers and and\nthe average uh time a reader spends on each uh story is he reads up to the\nfifth or sixth paragraph and then that's it unless he's really very\ninterested in\n\n\nSo you have to get him interested in right from the start\n\n\nAnd that's what intros are suppose to do\n\n\nAnd this is what it should be short to the point and generally\nthirty words is the accepted maximum\n\n\nYou read Straits Times although sometimes you you you see a bit\nmore for maybe political stories which require more explanation and but\ngenerally use thirty words alright\n\n\nOf course the other extreme is using too few words like in this\nexample here\n\n\nA man died yesterday\n\n\nWell sure but how\n\n\nAnd a man died yesterday is not half the exciting as talking\n\n\nYou see there's detail and she will come to later\n\n\nSo that's another part of the language that that uhm we have to\nuse carefully\n\n\nOf course if we have to read an intro once I think I said this\nbefore if you have to read it more than once and still can't digest the\nmeaning it has fail really\n\n\nWhat intro shouldn't have is questions\n\n\nNever ask your reader a question because it's most of them can't\nanswer it anyway", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "cef08982-570d-4bef-a2e2-953a95ba736d", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nGood afternoon ladies and gentlemen\n\n\nWelcome to the Lexmark product announcement perhaps uh from major\nannouncement of the year\n\n\nLet me first of all extent a warm welcome to all our customers and\nalso I understand our friendly competitors who are with us today\n\n\nI would like to congratulate most of you who have come here through\nthe heavy rain\n\n\nI understand that is going on outside or uh has it stop since I've\nbeen in here\n\n\nI know most of you would have a busy schedule and I'm delighted to\nhave the opportunity to present to you the latest Lexmark family of printers\n\n\nWe are very excited and optimistic about this new product\n\n\nIn the next thirty odd minutes I hope to cover all these new\nbenefits the that our new range of printers are going to provide you\n\n\nAnd I hope you'll be so persuaded that when you think of Lexmark\nwhen you think of laser printers it is either the IBM laser printers or the\nLexmark laser printers\n\n\nSo announcing today May fourth the new IBM laser printer series\nforty thirtynine\n\n\nWe are announcing four new models today namely the forty\nthirty-nine ten R the forty thirty-nine twelve R the forty thirty-nine twelve\nL the forty thirty-nine sixteen L\n\n\nAs you can see on the board the printers speed range from ten pages\nper minute sixteen pages per minute\n\n\nIn other words our printers today are targeted not so much to\nlow-end but at the medium to the LAN printers range\n\n\nOur existing range of laser printers the forty twenty-nine continue\nto be current line products\n\n\nFrom the chart you can see that forty twenty-nine which is a\nten-page per minute machine will be positioned slightly below the forty\nthirty-nine ten R\n\n\nAt the lowest end we continue to offer a very low end printer the\nforty nineteen E\n\n\nWhat I'm going to cover next in the next two charts is really uh to\npresent to you some of the things that uh we've discovered from talking to\ncustomers from speaking to our dealers things that we believe you as our\ncustomers find important in our laser printers\n\n\nI'm sure that you would recognise that these are the things that\nyou look for when you're buying a laser printer\n\n\nAnd I guess uh each of these will be more important than the rest\nto uh each and the individual one of you print quality ease of operation\ncompatibility to all the applications that you're running\n\n\nYour ability to connect the laser printer that you buy to your\nlocal area network\n\n\nYou want your printer to support all the protocols that you're\nrunning in your local area network\n\n\nAnd of course you want your printer to be of a reasonable speed if\nnot fast\n\n\nPaper handling I guess uh most of you would be aware I mean uh we\nuse transparency we use uh all sorts of paper uh text rough texture\n\n\nAlright we have thick paper and all sorts alright\n\n\nAs we speak to the customers we also told that uh hey we buy a\nlaser printer it cost a few thousand dollars how do you protect my investment\n\n\nCustomers today are getting more sophisticated\n\n\nThey are printing more and more sophisticated thing from the laser\nprinters\n\n\nThey want to know if they can store fonts or forms in the laser\nprinters so that the they can have a faster print out without having to down\nload the uh the forms or logos from the computer\n\n\nBeing real image conscious I think a lot of companies support today\nthe environment friendly movement\n\n\nAnd when you buy a laser printer I I would imagine that you would\nchoose a product that is environment friendly\n\n\nLast but certainly not least especially in a competitive market\nlike Singapore I think the price performance is certainly a key buying\ncriteria for most of you\n\n\nHaving gone through some of these uh features that I would imagine\nmost of you would look for I think we put together a printer that is what we\ncall uhm packed with features that are customer driven\n\n\nLet us look at what some of these benefits that you can enjoy from\nthis uh IBM lasers range uh sorry Lexmark IBM printers\n\n\nIn my discussions with uh a lot of the customers one of the things\nthat was single out most is compatibility\n\n\nWhen uh one buys a laser printer a customer hey when I bring the\nprinter back to my company I just want to uh plug the printer on\n\n\nI don't to change the drivers\n\n\nI don't want to change whatever configurations that I've already\nput into my software\n\n\nIn other words they want to plug the printer and play so to speak\n\n\nAlright so the the the IBM forty thrity-nine laser printers today\nare designed as we what we term as plug and play\n\n\nHow do we do this\n\n\nThe forty thirty-nine printers come standard with the PCL five and\nthe PostScript uh data screen as standard\n\n\nIn other words most of you whose applications are running on PCL\nfive or PostScript will find that you would have no problem with data screen\nsupport\n\n\nIf you are a Macintosh well we have the apple-top option that you\ncould easily plug on and then use this highly competitive machines in a\nMacintosh environment\n\n\nCertainly second on the list must surely be ease of use\n\n\nWhen you buy a laser printer and you put it in your company\ndifferent people use it and different people with uh different skill levels\n\n\nSo you must make sure that the laser printer is easy to use\n\n\nSo when we ship the printer today we ship it to what we call a\nQuick Start set up utility\n\n\nWhat is this\n\n\nThis is a series of diskettes that we put into the uh box that when\nyou open it you can uh run this into PC and you realise that these diskettes\ncontain the popular drivers for the drivers for you popular applications\n\n\nIt provides you with uh help screens that help you in store your\nprinters in whatever configuration you want\n\n\nAnd basically the bottom line is to make installation so easy that\nyou generally do not have to read the manual or call your dealer up to help\nyou with it\n\n\nThe forty thirty-nine following the tradition of the forty\ntwenty-nine where we have had a very intuitive operator panel to make it easy\nfor the end-users\n\n\nThe forty thirty-nine comes with a four-line display alright uh\n\n\nI can assure you that this operator panel is very easy to use very\nintuitive hard for me to stand here and convince you I guess\n\n\nBut uh what I would encourage you to do is when this session is\nover the machines are placed behind\n\n\nI would encourage each each of you to look at the machines and try\nout the panel for yourself and I'm sure you would agree with me that the\npanel is very easy to use\n\n\nHaving said that you need to plug and play it means that the\nprinter must be smart enough to know what data stream is coming to it\n\n\nSo we've packed into the forty thirty-nine what we call the smart\nswitch\n\n\nThe smart switch feature will sniff out for you the data stream of\nthe file that you're that sending to the printer\n\n\nIn other words if you were if your printer is on PCL 5 font and a\nPostScript file is coming on the printer will know it's a PostScript file and\nautomatically switch to PostScript alright\n\n\nSo in other words uh no operating complication and no garbage print\n\n\nWe have have what we call the automatic port sensing alright the\nprinter comes with standard a serial port a parallel port and ability for you\nto hook up a internal network adaptor card\n\n\nSo in other words for you to print from each of these ports your\nprinter is smart enough to detect where the signals are coming into which\nport and uh having detected which is your active port you must know how to\nswitch\n\n\nSo automatic port setting comes standard and that makes it very\neasy to use\n\n\nJust like the forty thirty twenty-nines the new laser printers have\ngot the print cartridge in stored when it is shipped so that makes it easy\nfor you again when you open the box the print cartridge is already in the\nprinter\n\n\nAnd uh again finally but not the least you have a laser printer\nthat is small in size light in weight especially if you compare the LAN model\nthe forty thirty-nine sixteen L when you compare it to some of the uh local\narea network printer out in the market\n\n\nYou would realise that we've got a printer that is of a very small\nfoot print but yet do the job of being a LAN printer\n\n\nNow print quality why would one want to buy a laser printer\n\n\nI guess uh first and foremost we want to have excellent print\nquality because it affects our image after all\n\n\nWhen we launch the dates fourteen twentynine laser printer we say\nit's your image make the most of it\n\n\nSo the laser printers ability to do a six hundred dot per inch\nresolution we have the what we call the print quality enhancement technology\n\n\nThis is a curve smoothing technology that is now available in the\nsix hundred dots per inch environment\n\n\nIn other words you get sharper print than ever\n\n\nThe laser printers today come with a new technology that Lexmark\nhas incorporated called the PictureGrade\n\n\nThis is a image enhancement technology\n\n\nNow with this technology it allows the uh Lexmark laser printers to\nprint up to to print images right with up to one hundred shades of grey\n\n\nThe number of shades of grey that you can print will directly\naffect the print quality of the graphics that you print\n\n\nSo if you look at some of the printouts that we have that has grey\nscaling I'm sure you agree with me that with this latest PictureGrade\nenhancement technology we've got printouts that are far superior to what we\nhave seen\n\n\nThe next thing that we've done to increase the uhm print quality is\nreally the superior toner technology\n\n\nWhat this does is to avoid the ghosting image problem\n\n\nI understand that ? ? that some of the printers competition\nprinters out there today do have this problem\n\n\nIn other words uh when you print a black uh when you print a page\nthat has a lot of black on it and then you go on to the next page and you uh\nhold up the text page against the light you do see some of the ghosting\neffect left from the previous page\n\n\nUsing the superior toner technology Lexmark is able to avoid this\nproblem\n\n\nAnd I think uh if you compare printouts that has got a lot of\npatches of black with the uh Lexmark printers this is superior machine to a\nlot of those that are out in the market\n\n\nTo allow to increase the quality of your printout we give you\nfifty-two scalable fonts and we also give you the ability to adjust the\nstroke weight of this font\n\n\nHaving print quality is important but so is having a high having a\nmachine that prints at a speed that you want\n\n\nWe have uh move on from the Motorola ? ? uh processes that we use\nin the forty twenty-nine to the RISC processes RISC processes as you would\nknow is faster in calculate in rected?? calculations\n\n\nAnd that gives you a much faster printout especially when you have\ncomplicated uh graphic\n\n\nAs mention earlier the printers the printers start from ten pages\nper minute goes all the way up to sixteen pages per minute\n\n\nIn order to uh increase print speed we have what we call the\nadvance memory management system", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nGood afternoon everyone\n\n\nUhm you will have seen quite a few things on that video\n\n\nAnd if you noticed you know as you listen to to me and if you even\nlook at the little advertising brochure there's a lot of focus about doing\nsomething worthwhile to your lives\n\n\nAnd you sort of look at it and you can go my god am I suppose to be\na saint you know\n\n\nIs this some sort of a profession where you have to have a little\nlobe to your head and you got to be into a calling\n\n\nUhm from one point of view you know that's often a way teaching is\nconsidered\n\n\nYou sort of look at it and you sort of think that uhm from a very\naltruistic point of view\n\n\nYou're taking care of other people and well I work with seventeen\nand eighteen year olds uhm which is not far away from your age I suppose\n\n\nAnd really it is that because you know when you first start out when\nI started out\n\n\nAnd in NIE you don't really think that you're going to be doing\nmuch except imparting knowledge that you're going to tell someone about\nsomething else and that's that\n\n\nBut you know once start you find to your horror really and you're\nnot just doing that you become in the course of time a lot of other little\nsurrogate things\n\n\nYou become a surrogate you know\n\n\nYou sort of get all the problems nobody wants to tell their par\nparents\n\n\nSo they sort of bring it along to you or you get you know surrogate\ngirlfriend or boyfriend as well\n\n\nThey sort of use you as his prop they try out their lines before\nthey go and attempt to engage with other people\n\n\nSo you know it's a lot of things which focus your attention on\nother people\n\n\nSo from that point of view where is it you know <unclear> word\n</unclear> uses the catch phrase about doing something worthwhile with your\nlife\n\n\nYes there is a relevance to it\n\n\nThere is a meaning to it because you are forever working with other\npeople and that's where I like to start with by telling you\n\n\nIf you want to ask yourself why teach ask yourself this question do\nyou like people\n\n\nCan you stand noise\n\n\nWould you like your life to be in a state of turmoil at times\n\n\nAnd would you like difference\n\n\nIf your answers to this sort of things are yes then you're on your\nway to finding out what is there in the teaching profession\n\n\nNow you know the sort of images you had there on the video screen\nabout you know where you can do all sorts of little different things it's\nperfectly true\n\n\nYes I'm not denying the fact that no one will be a teacher and\nanyone who sat in a classroom can't deny the fact there's the boring mundane\nstuff to do\n\n\nThere's the timetable that everybody follows and everybody hates\n\n\nThere's marking that the teacher does\n\n\nLook at at anyone of us straight in the eye and ask us whether we\nlike the marking we'll look at you and say is the moon made up of blue cheese\n\n\nNo we all made the stuff\n\n\nSo we do it anyway\n\n\nBut I can look at you and say from a counter perspective are you\nreally thinking that anywhere in any job in any country that there is not\ngoing to be something which is routine\n\n\nRoutines are there\n\n\nIt's part of life\n\n\nBut I'm telling you that while the paper work routine might be\nthere in the teaching profession there is one thing that will always change\n\n\nNow if you're a banker your central consideration is not so much at\nleast from my point of view it's not so much the person in front of you it's\nthat sheet of figures in front of you\n\n\nIt's that thing the figures and whether or not it's going to\nbalance whether or not at the end of the day everything is going to come out\nin picture perfect on paper\n\n\nSo you're working with people but only as a by-product\n\n\nNot as a direct and in front of you\n\n\nLet me take another example\n\n\nNow let's say you were a doctor you could say that just as\naltruistic as being a teacher is it worthwhile staying away\n\n\nYou can't look at anyone and deny it's not worthwhile\n\n\nBut again you know people are there but you're more interested in\ntheir in their insides the bits that you want to cut out not living and\nthey're not looking at them at least from my point of view\n\n\nI think you're looking more in them for things\n\n\nAgain they're there but they're a by-product because you're\nfocussed on something else\n\n\nBut when you're teaching there's no way you're going to avoid one\nthing\n\n\nThere's is going to be a person\n\n\nIn fact if you teach in a secondary school up to thirty-five of\nthem\n\n\nYou teach in a junior college fifteen to twenty-five they're going\nto be there\n\n\nThey're going to be staring at you and they're be all looking at\nyou wondering so what you you're going to do with us today\n\n\nBut we don't want to do anything\n\n\nThat's the hard realities of life and you'll never run away with\nthe fact there is a person there and you would have to communicate with that\nperson\n\n\nNow that to me is the call of teaching because you're a people and\nno one person is the same as the next and that makes it so highly flexible so\nhighly different\n\n\nNow you will find out most of us especially those of us who teach\nEnglish chatter on forever simply\n\n\nBecause we collect stories of students and it gets terribly boring\nbecause we have stories about who to go up to whom and who did where to what\n\n\nBut that's our problem you see we are with people all the time and\nyou know\n\n\nIf you look around and ask some people why they stay in the\nprofession when they're been in it for thirty forty years they'll tell you\nbecause of people\n\n\nAnd because the fact when you're with someone else you can't be\nselfish you got to forever look out look at other people\n\n\nAnd in looking at them I can tell you you learn something by\nyourself as well\n\n\nYou'll learn to grow because from another point of view I could say\nthis teaching is not just a noble profession\n\n\nThe highly self-indulgent profession cause you could sit there\n\n\nNow if you ever wanted to be power crazy this is your ideal chance\n\n\nYou have people at your mercy and there are many new things that\ncan be done and only things that limit you are your imagination\n\n\nSo you know I can I can take a really humerous point of view and\nsay that many teachers me included we're all probably self-indulgent\n\n\nYou know that's the truth of it but from another point of view it's\nalso self <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nI beg your pardon it's in your self-interest because you are never\ngoing to be static as a teacher you just can't be\n\n\nThere's no two situation which is the same\n\n\nYes the books for instance in my in my particular area the books I\nteach might be the same but no two people react to the same thing in the same\nmanner\n\n\nSo you know in that way it's different\n\n\nI can give you an example\n\n\nNow in the college I work in we do what's call the Fun-O-Rama or a\nfun fair every two years\n\n\nIt's great fun and we all say yes you know yes this year there\nwon't be trouble we will have good fun\n\n\nUh but if we get every year there is a new set of people\n\n\nSo one year we have a peaceful time everything gets set up and you\nsort of walk around you'll be like a middle manager you know the real\nprofessional type\n\n\nAll you have to do is walk around and check and say oh it's going\nwell isn't that nice\n\n\nThat was fine and the next year went round screw up the gas\ncanister real fire going\n\n\nSo you see it's just of variety all the time and that kind of\nvariety carries over into the way you teach someone\n\n\nNow I would think what uhm what the speaker said on the video is\nvery very accurate\n\n\nThis is the one profession where your mind will continue to grow\nintellectually\n\n\nYou can't just say well I was train as a heart I train in\npsychology or something else or history\n\n\nBut now I work somewhere else doing something which is nothing to\ndo with my degree\n\n\nGod <unclear> word </unclear> I really like teaching\n\n\nIt's always to be something directly relevant to a degree in front\nof you\n\n\nI bet that you're going to grow as well\n\n\nSo from one point of view teaching's ideal for anybody doesn't want\na quiet back <unclear> word </unclear> who wants that to have a little bit\nmore of excitement\n\n\nBut not the kind of excitement that revolves only around making\nmoney\n\n\nIt you know I'm not saying that you can't get rich in teaching\n\n\nIt's a stable job honest and you know the pay scales are good\ncomparative to some place in in the private sector\n\n\nRight can't deny but even if you found your own doe you don't keep\nup you do the other things because you gain in a personal way which you may\nnot do if you just push paper\n\n\nNow if you ask me which is the part I like the most about the\nteaching I would say the people I would meet\n\n\nI'm always meet the people and the fact that they keep coming back\nto you you know\n\n\nIf they start out as your students especially when you were\nseventeen and eighteen and that age group\n\n\nThey start as your students if you're lucky they become your\nfriends and that's the best part of it\n\n\nSo you think about it in this point of view\n\n\nWould you really want to turn down a job where one you can grow\nintellectually\n\n\nTwo there's always difference\n\n\nThree you're constantly meeting new people and making friends\n\n\nIf these three things are going to be important as a matter of your\nlife have this with the profession that should have your vision\n\n\nSo please think about it \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nGood evening again good afternoon rather still afternoon okay\n\n\nRight let me first go through the course that you would be doing\nin NIE\n\n\nDr Chen has mentioned to you and has given you the core structure\n\n\nJust to familiarise yourself with terminologies\n\n\nI like to go through the types of the course and the duration and\nwhat you need to have the basic requirements okay\n\n\nFirstly you have the postgraduate diploma in education in\nsecondary\n\n\nWhenever the term secondary is mentioned it includes JC okay\n\n\nThis course is for equips you to put all the skills pedagogical\nskills to teach in secondary JC levels okay\n\n\nThe first programme which is academic only it's a nine-month okay\nand you enter into July and you finish off in the following March with your\nexams then you go to schools to teach okay\n\n\nAnd for this you need to have a degree from a university in at\nleast two teaching subjects\n\n\nThis is what Miss Charlotte Beck has been telling you two teaching\nsubjects is essential\n\n\nAnd you know in secondary schools most of the teachers would teach\ntwo okay\n\n\nIn JC you may specialise in one subject okay and most of our JC\nteachers are people with Honours degree\n\n\nSo if you want just trying <unclear> word </unclear> to teach at\nJC and nothing you must have Honours\n\n\nThere are some without Honours degree but that's the exception\nrather than the rule alright \n\n\nNow the next type of programme for secondary is PGDE postgraduate\ndiploma in education with PE specialisation Okay some of you are very sports\nincline you're very sporty uhm some of the men are as well okay you can apply\nto teach too for this course to be trained in the PGDE secondary with PE It's\none year and nine months an extra year this is because at the moment in NUS\nwe do not have NUS or NTU we do not have a degree in PE", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "697cf54c-2e09-43e7-a0e0-96ff220ae29a", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nWell good afternoon to all of you\n\n\nI would appreciate if you all of you can come down a little bit so\nthat we can look eye-to-eye\n\n\nWe'll see double rather than having you looking down on me\n\n\nI'm going to making me feel small\n\n\nSo quickly just move down a little bit\n\n\nBesides I don't have the neck at all I have problem raising up head\n\n\nTrue\n\n\nCan you please come down\n\n\nThe fact that you're here this afternoon I think speaks very well\nupon you\n\n\nThis is a beginning of a very exciting <unclear> word </unclear>\nwell for tertiary institute for tertiary learning am I right to say you're\nfirst year\n\n\nJust by show of hand I would like to know how many of you are doing\nfirst year academic subjects like History Geography English Literature that\nkind\n\n\nHow many\n\n\nOkay but I'm speaking to also quite a number of people who are in\nSocial Sciences who are doing things like Economics Sociology Political\nScience am I right\n\n\nOkay so I know whom I'm talking to\n\n\nGood yes as I've been introduced I am Chen Ai-yen\n\n\nGeetha was in NIE four years ago five years ago three well only\nthree and you can see that she is still as young as ever\n\n\nOne of the greatest delight of a teacher is to really see your\nstudent grow and bloom\n\n\nAnd she was like that but now there's even more poise\n\n\nDo you think that she's very very confident\n\n\nYes she's really happening\n\n\nOkay of course it has nothing to do with one fact she was one of my\nfavourites\n\n\nAlright that she was in my tutorial and I know her intimately well\n\n\nWell but it's not that because she talked about the challenges and\nrealities of teaching and one of the realities is that you really know people\n\n\nTrue you people\n\n\nShe also talked about that teaching is very very different from\nother jobs\n\n\nVery true\n\n\nSometimes beginning you are skeptical\n\n\nHow do you know\n\n\nYou know this from <unclear> word </unclear> the others are just\nimagination\n\n\nLet me tell you my personal example okay\n\n\nI did not join teaching as uhm a first career\n\n\nWhen I graduated from at that time it's called the University of\nMalaya and Singapore long time ago I actually join the then Radio and\nTelevision Singapore\n\n\nI was a news editor it was exciting jobs\n\n\nI was in parliament\n\n\nI was chasing facts I'll be all over the place you know and you\nwrite bold stories\n\n\nMine you at that time because there're very few people you do more\nthings than people nowadays because now usually they're more specilisation\n\n\nAnd I was in the job for five years\n\n\nThere were times when Dan Buttsworth you know with the oil rig\nnames people will say you want to go Vietnam you want to go uh Sarawak you\nwant to go here and there and I always drawback\n\n\nAnd I said I'm only a woman you know I think it'll be too dangerous\nto go out to the field in that those ways\n\n\nIt is true life out there in journalism\n\n\nI now it's a very very uh popular subject nowadays very exciting\n\n\nIt's true you talk to people\n\n\nIt's true it's people orientated but not quite centred\n\n\nIn no time in journalism really shapes the lives of people and no\ntime is journalist really eight hours interacting with students\n\n\nWell I may not have eight hours in fact time <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n\nI'm dead because we were in a tertiary hold you know\n\n\nI am I'm not with secondary school\n\n\nBut in secondary school it's true\n\n\nWhen you have a school function sometimes you literally live with\nthem\n\n\nI know of one JC teacher who happen to be single who actually live\nin the school during examination time just to be with the students and all\nthe students no wonder did very well\n\n\nMidnight he plays basketball somebody in VJC\n\n\nI think some of you may know who this is alright\n\n\nSo this is what I call a mark of dedication\n\n\nDoing so you are a model the person did not set himself out to be a\nmodel but sometimes you became a model who is much talked about and everybody\nremembers him\n\n\nSo it's not just uh imparter of knowledge he's actually a moulder\nof dreams a moulder of lives\n\n\nAnd it's no wonder Renuka said that perhaps the reason why you're\nhere your teachers contributed towards that\n\n\nOf course many of you would say it is me who has done a lot of\nstudy okay\n\n\nSo now what have I got to do when I'm here not just to affirm\nwhatever Geetha has said\n\n\nShe said that teaching is truly exciting is truly exciting is truly\nchallenging\n\n\nIt's not just that but also to tell you that when you come to\nteaching in other profession I'm not exactly sure they truly give you a\nprofessional degree\n\n\nBut when you become a teacher you are trained professional\n\n\nDon't believe you go into engineering course you into accountancy\ncourse which are courses of NTU that I know quite well by now\n\n\nYou're are given all the subjects to learn you go through practical\n\n\nExactly how to behave like an engineer nobody told them how\n\n\nTrue\n\n\nYou'll say engineering and accountancy is problem-solving and\nkeeping records\n\n\nWhat else\n\n\nNothing else\n\n\nWe can tell you we teacher in <unclear> word </unclear> can tell\nyou what this profession involves and how does a train look\n\n\nAnd this is what you do\n\n\nWe have specific goals\n\n\nAt the end of our training we can be sure that you are\nknowledgeable you're competent and you're reflective\n\n\nYou look at Geetha she's only one of many excellent teachers\n\n\nBy the time you go through just a one year programme you'll be\nknowledgeable in the ways of the child not perfect of course\n\n\nEveryday is a journey towards learning\n\n\nYou'll learn more about should you go into the PGDE Primary\nprogramme more about children their developments\n\n\nIf you go into PGDE Secondary programme you would know how all\nabout adolescents\n\n\nIf you go into PGDE Physical Education programme you will be more\nknowledgeable about the way not only people behave but the way the physical\nmeans and built so that you can stretch how your body can really go into uhm\nthe the the maximum\n\n\nYou become very competent communicators\n\n\nOne of the greatest things of professionals is to be able to\ncommunicate well\n\n\nI'm quite likely sure that an engineer or an accountant or well\nmedical doctors usually speak quite well some of the people really speak very\nwell\n\n\nTeachers in general get through because they have specialist speech\ntraining\n\n\nThey speak well they certainly know what they're talking the only\nthing is how to stop them right\n\n\nThere might be some true that we talk all the time we are\nreflective I think we think over what we have done\n\n\nYou can never find another lecture of mine exactly the same even if\nit is said in the afternoon\n\n\nYou can be sure because you know how to gear our teaching to the\nneeds of your audience\n\n\nYou noticed what I did the very time I must know my audience\n\n\nI must know who I'm talking to\n\n\nI know you're from Arts and Social Science the first year\n\n\nI know what exactly what are the subjects you're taking because it\nhelped me in the way I pitch my conversation\n\n\nSo reflection is not just to be about lagu <unclear> word\n</unclear> and in deep thought and when people talk to you you don't know\nanswer\n\n\nI don't mean that\n\n\nI mean that you factually think through and think back on the\nthings you do\n\n\nSo that's one way that you can grow a mark of a growing\nprofessional\n\n\nSo the goals of our teacher education programme are simply three\nvery simple they get not that easily achievable but you do\n\n\nHow do we make you do this\n\n\nSo we have courses in educational studies professional courses\n\n\nWe have courses in curriculum studies to make you teach in subject\nareas\n\n\nThis is where I come into\n\n\nWhy did I ask you to raise your hands\n\n\nIf you are have academic subjects here in NUS you're entering into\nthe excitement of the discipline in certain discipline alright\n\n\nIf you have academic discipline like Literature English you know\neven Chinese or or some other subject which I subjects which you take well\nyou become you is very easy for you to become PGDE Secondary teachers\n\n\nBecause your specialisation subjects and later on I think Rebuka\nuh will tell you more about that\n\n\nBut if you are not but if you have read <unclear> word </unclear>\nEconomics Social Work or what it is Psychology and that sort of thing well\nchance is that you will be doing the teacher course in primary school because\nyou don't have content knowledge or such a depth as to be able to meet the\nchallenge of the school\n\n\nWe have not said that you would not be parting knowledge in terms\nof discipline right you will\n\n\nBut this is not the one thing you do\n\n\nIt is one of the many things you do but it is a very important\nthing so you must have content\n\n\nNow that will help you\n\n\nI think those of you come here we'll like to complement you and\nyou to select your courses wisely\n\n\nDon't just say Psychology is very important\n\n\nSociologists are also very important\n\n\nBut actually I want to teach in secondary school\n\n\nWell too bad because you do not have <unclear> word </unclear>\nacademic subject\n\n\nWhereas if you are a graduate in any of those disciplines and you\nwant to do PE the consideration is slightly different\n\n\nYou will really like to be very robust and strong physique and\ngood in your physical coordinations before you can be considered you know for\nthat kind of degree\n\n\nSo there must be something which is natural in you before we can\nnurture you as well <unclear> word </unclear> okay\n\n\nAnd so this is quite true you have to consider teaching curriculum\nstudies how to teach those subjects\n\n\nBy the time you come to us we won't be teaching you the content of\nGeography or History or Literature but we will teach you how to teach those\nsubjects\n\n\nI hope you can you are with me clear? okay because that helps too\nin the shaping uhm selection of your subjects\n\n\nAnd the third part which is very important is the time you really\ngain practice in school\n\n\nAnd you will have the cooperation of teachers like Geetha Manee\n\n\nI'm sure she has been cooperating teachers to some younger\nteachers and pass on her skills\n\n\nYou work with professionals in a very professional way including\n\n\nHow to handle mundane routine things like timetable\n\n\nNobody likes it and yet you know how to smile you know and because\nwell in every sphere of life there are certain things you don't like to do\n\n\nBut you just have to do okay so timetable is one instance\n\n\nSo this is what we promise you one year programme and we will give\nyou a fully trained programme\n\n\nFor those of you who are in Chinese or uhm uhm general not\nJapanese Chinese or Malay you will be recruited into the PGDE special\nprogramme where you would be taking not just uhm uh the the these courses\nthat I am telling you\n\n\nIn addition to educational studies and going through the practical\nin your curricular area you will be specialising in the languages that you're\nspecialising and your moral education\n\n\nSo in brief this is the course that we offer to all the graduates\nof GDPE primary secondary and physical education\n\n\nThree years time four years time I'm looking forward to welcome\nyou to with open arms as fellow professionals \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nGood evening ladies and gentlemen\n\n\nUhm on behalf of the National University of Singapore Society I\nwelcome you to this talk this evening\n\n\nMy name is Zaibun Siraj and I take charge of the study group\nsub-committee\n\n\nAs many of you know the study group sub-committee organises all\nthe talks and forums uhm on a variety of topics from political to economics\nto social et cetera \n\n\nWe value your inputs and if you have any advise and suggestions\nas to what kind of talks you want for the future do let me

{"text": "<$A> \n\nOkay the learning point of this exercise is this\n\n\nFirst you must have be creative enough or be imaginative enough to\nlocate where the pages are\n\n\nThen you use your logic to work out the total answer the logic ha\n\n\nBut you are not creative enough or you are not imaginative enough to\nlocate where the pages are\n\n\nAll your logic will go to nought will go to waste\n\n\nYou think about that\n\n\nThat's why sometime you go and see your boss\n\n\nYour boss scold you aye you're not imaginative enough lah always\ngive this sort of answer not imaginative\n\n\nImagination is very important as what Einstein says imagination is\nmore important than knowledge\n\n\nEinstein was reading he was one day daydreaming riding on a beam of\nlight shooting towards the distant star\n\n\nBut to his great surprise he did not arrive at a distant star he\narrived at our local front our front here\n\n\nSay aye what what has what has happened\n\n\nSo he used his logic to explain\n\n\nIt should actually mark a curve instead of going straight\n\n\nIn another words uh light is does not necessarily tra travel on a\nstraight line\n\n\nIt's curve the universe is curve\n\n\nSo he kept <unclear> word </unclear> to accumulate when he look at\nthe curve\n\n\nSo how did he arrive\n\n\nFirstly he used his imagination his creative <unclear> word\n</unclear> thinking after then he use his logic to explain\n\n\nSo coming back to coming back to our problem which is more\nimportant\n\n\nCreative thinking or logic thinking\n\n\nCreative thinking or logical\n\n\nCreative thinking\n\n\nIf you look at it you and I we all graduates\n\n\nAs a graduate we're paid that extra premium to solve logical\nproblem or creative problem\n\n\nCreative problem logical problem the clerk can do no need you\n\n\nWhat for employ you\n\n\nIf you don't you see logic problem is application of set principles\nset set rules lah\n\n\nI give you ten dollar you must give four dollar\n\n\nI mean it's all very standard stuff\n\n\nOkay if you your your car cannot park here fine ten dollars\n\n\nJust fine ten dollars straight away\n\n\nLogical it's that logical applying set principles\n\n\nBut you and I are paid premiums to do creative solving to do\ncreative problem solving\n\n\nIf my problem is very logical no need to employ you lah basic task\n\n\nYou are you are employed for the job to think\n\n\nThink creatively\n\n\nNow what sort of problems are difficult to solve\n\n\nCreative problems or logical problems\n\n\nCreative problems\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nFirstly because of greater degree of uncertainty\n\n\nNumber two you must create your own answer the answers are not off\nthe shelf\n\n\nNumber three it takes longer time to solve because there is uh no\nset procedure\n\n\nSo these are three reasons why creative problems are harder to\nsolve than logical problem\n\n\nWhat's the difference between logic problem and creative problem\n\n\nLogical problems you use logic\n\n\nYou use what what you call convergent thinking\n\n\nYou also uh yah and one answer alright\n\n\nAnd lastly uh uh and there are four also don't know what I'm\ntalking about let me to check\n\n\nThere are three only\n\n\nLet me get it facts right\n\n\nSometimes I forget it\n\n\nAlright okay basically uh right one use convergence one use logic\none answer convergent thinking vertical thinking\n\n\nIf you have to use imagination then answer divergent in other words\n\n\nOkay can I leave\n\n\nSo much so for practical problem let us go into uh uh creative\nprinciple ha eight major principles\n\n\nHere's try <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nThe first thing in creative principle is uh testing assumptions\ntesting assumptions\n\n\nYou must always test assumptions\n\n\nIn fact when you talk about creativity uh willing to stick till\nthere I can hear all the right answer\n\n\nJust listen is good enough\n\n\nAlright okay okay uh let me tell you about about creativity in\nterms of uh in terms of something which is very practical\n\n\nI think when we talk about creativity actually we're talking about\nhow can we shape our paradigm\n\n\nNow paradigm subserves assumptions ways of doing things\n\n\nWe all have paradigm\n\n\nWhy is it that we're not creative in large in part because we have\ncertain mind type certain way of doing thing and this can be very dangerous\n\n\nParadigm set out to do on people's graphs <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nOr <unclear> word </unclear> <unclear> word </unclear> you it\nprevent us from seeing things\n\n\nAnd that's pooh pooh <unclear> word </unclear> status\n\n\nLet me give you an example\n\n\nIn 1968 the Swiss control seventy per cent of the watch industry\n\n\nThey got seventy per cent market share\n\n\nThat's really markets of you know\n\n\nIn 1978 they only control ten per cent market share\n\n\nThat is 'kosong' almost 'kosong'\n\n\nThis is what I call the shift in paradigm\n\n\nOf course from seventy per cent to ten per cent what happens\n\n\nWhat has what has happen\n\n\nIn 1968 one of the Swiss engineer New <unclear> word </unclear>\nChepard <unclear> word </unclear> invented the quartz watch\n\n\nWhen he invented the quartz he showed it to all the Swiss designers\n\n\nBut the Swiss designer the Swiss watch maker of of of his day have\na good look at the quartz watch and they'll say this cannot be a watch this\nis no tread how can this ever be a watch\n\n\nIf you have no main spring no gear no bearing how can it ever be a\nwatch\n\n\nAi yah nothing one nah this one just ignore it\n\n\nSo the poor engineer uh but they allow the poor engineer to exhibit\nhis uh quartz watch in the International uh Watch Show\n\n\nSeiko and Texas Instrument were there 1968\n\n\nBoth took a good look at the quartz watch and the rest is all\nhistory\n\n\nThe Swiss have to sack fifty thousand of their sixty-five thousand\nworkers in the watch-making industry\n\n\nThat's catastrophe because Switzerland is like Singapore very small\n\n\nThey got three point five million people and we got about about\nslightly more\n\n\nTo be sack twenty thousand of the people sack within ten years that\nis uh that is certainty very hard to imagine\n\n\nBut what has happen\n\n\nThis is because the Swiss watch-maker were caught in their own\nparadigm\n\n\nNo main spring no gear no bearings how can this ever be a watch\n\n\nForget it this cannot be a watch and this prove catastrophic for\nthem\n\n\nLet me tell you another story of our time\n\n\nThis is pertaining to the CD player you know the compact disc\nplayer\n\n\nActually it was uh Sony that invented the CD player back in the\nseventies early seventies\n\n\nBut after deferring for a couple of years they gave it up because\nthey just put it on the shelf\n\n\nBut it so happen that Philips was also developing it\n\n\nBut Philips thought that Sony got head start maybe we should just\ngo and talk to Sony they may tell a thing or two\n\n\nSo uh Philips brought their CD player along and Philip show Sony\ntheir CD player\n\n\nWhen when the Sony people saw Philips' CD player they nearly drop\ndead because Philips produced the CD player of what we know of today the four\nand the half inch one is it very small one\n\n\nDo you know why the Sony people nearly drop dead\n\n\nAll the while they were thinking of twelve-inch CD player\n\n\nYou see ah when you invent a twelve-inch CD player\n\n\nSee if I could <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nFirstly if you want to make it portable carry around okay besides\nbeing bulky or what let say you you manage to make it portable\n\n\nThe thing is this lah a twelve-inch CD player can last eight hours\nof playing time\n\n\nNow which battery can last eight hour\n\n\nYou have problem number one\n\n\nProblem number two you know how much a record player cost if it is\ntwelve-inch that runs for eight hours\n\n\nOne hour already cost you thirty buck eight hours my goodness\nalmost three hundred buck\n\n\nWho could afford a piece that cost three hundred buck\n\n\nSo no wonder they put it on the shelf\n\n\nYou see the Sony people were caught in the paradigm of the of what\n\n\nOf the twelve-inch record player and because when they got stuck\nthey couldn't move at all\n\n\nThey got stuck and they could not move at all\n\n\nOnce you get the danger of paradigm getting caught you know\ngetting caught\n\n\nI'll like to talk about McDonalds in Singapore\n\n\nWhen Robert Kwan wanted to introduce the McDonalds in Singapore it\nwas especially a paradigm shift too\n\n\nIt was a relevant shift\n\n\nHe see a lot obstacles\n\n\nThe obstacle is firstly he's bringing in the concept of fast-food\n\n\nNo need fast-food in Singapore a hawker centre our hawker centre\nequally fast\n\n\nYou sit down there for five minutes the fellow give you right\n\n\nHow can I talk about fast food\n\n\nNumber two Singaporeans don't eat beef right because many of us\nare Buddhist right\n\n\nHamburger also got beef\n\n\nNumber three there was already a a fast-food centre here\n\n\nA & W and A & W therefore they were struggling right\n\n\nThey were not doing business\n\n\nIn fact I mean they were about to you know at the verge of\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nThey were struggling\n\n\nBut here again a paradigm shift\n\n\nRobert Kwan in McDonalds prove them all wrong okay\n\n\nSo it's very dangerous if we get stuck to a paradigm ha\n\n\nWe need to to break away from this from this paradigm from this\nusual way of thinking from this concept\n\n\nI think however a little bit crazy ha\n\n\nOkay first step paradigm breakage is that we must always try to\ntest our assumptions\n\n\nTesting assumptions is very critical\n\n\nLet me tell you a story\n\n\nTwo boys went to a forest\n\n\nThey met a bear\n\n\nThe bear started to give chase of the two boys\n\n\nHalf-way through through the running uh the two boys one of the\nboys stopped\n\n\nHe tried to take out from his back-pack his Reebok running shoes\nand started to put it on\n\n\nThe other boy turn around and you crazy fellow what for you put on\nyour Reebok running shoes\n\n\nYou'll never run faster than a bear\n\n\nThe other boy putting on his shoe turn around and say yes it is\ntrue\n\n\nI'll never run faster than a bear but I only have to run faster\nthan you\n\n\nThat's what I mean by testing assumptions\n\n\nAnyway you can go wrong <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nFirst assumption was of course run faster than a bear\n\n\nSecond assumption is to run faster than the boy than the bear will\ncatch the boy won't catch you\n\n\nBut that doesn't mean that you all should go back and uh don't\nhave to work very hard\n\n\nJust work better than your other colleagues\n\n\nOkay the second thing that we need to do is uh in fact testing\nassumptions is uh we have to be pos we we have to adopt a positive attitude\n\n\nOkay you have to try to obtain a you can get ready uh to\n\n\nOkay uh I want you to give me as many comments as possible\n\n\nAlright I give you uh two minutes to think about my new wheel\nbarrow\n\n\nCan see my wheel barrow ha\n\n\nCan see my beautiful wheel barrow\n\n\nForget about the spelling a bit wrong don't worry I'm damn\nhopeless on spelling B A R R O W\n\n\nOkay I can never get the spelling <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nOkay I'll write uh what uh give me as many comments you can think\nof\n\n\nI'll be going round to collect comment so everybody must come up\nwith one ah okay\n\n\nWe'll start with the other row and save this row from all\nembarrassment <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nOkay we'll start from the first row okay\n\n\nFirst comment any comment\n\n\nYou can repeat what other people had said nevermind\n\n\n\n\n\nNow look carefully\n\n\nIf I were to look carefully at all your comments actually uh this\nis what you want\n\n\nI told you this a design of a new wheel barrow\n\n\nHa I did say this is new wheel barrow design\n\n\nOkay doesn't matter lah\n\n\nOkay lah I I okay lah\n\n\nI don't know what I say\n\n\nOkay nevermind \n\n\nAh alright okay if I were to look carefully at all your comments\nah actually this is what you want right Observe carefully Am I not right this\nis what you want? Correct or not? So what you want is a what? A conventional\nold wheel barrow What you want is a conventional old wheel barrow But when\nyou see a new design of wheel barrow you 'ng kum guan' You must go back to\nthe original", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f72e2c73-0c45-4580-a252-c29d1b07798f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.659958+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nBut in this part of the world we're still okay and uh and the\nemphasis is really is to say how do we look at the market place today and how\ncan address those challenges that we have\n\n\nAnd uh when I look at you it makes me feel very young I mean it was\nuh seems like yesterday that I was still thinking of\n\n\nAnd uh the way that he gave me the the the introduction makes me\nfeel very old eight years\n\n\nOkay market management\n\n\nWhat I intend to is that I just go through a very uh brief outline\nof what market management is all about\n\n\nAnd uh if any point in time whereby you want to stop me and ask\nquestions please do so right\n\n\nDon't hesitate to that\n\n\nNow since this is entrepreneurship society right I should talk about\nname?? of entrepreneurs\n\n\nNow I just want to have this chart\n\n\nNow you have a lot of uh hell a lot of definition on what's what an\nentrepreneur is and uh in my personal opinion this is nothing this is just my\nopinion alright\n\n\nI think there should be a balance between in-born traits and\nacquired knowledge right\n\n\nIn-born traits are something like you cannot learn\n\n\nI mean it's in you whether you have a guts you dare to take risk\nare you a risk taker or are you a risk adverse\n\n\nAre you innovative do you have a vision\n\n\nDo you have a strong desire to succeed and whether you have\nbusiness acumen\n\n\nThis is something that is one side of the weighing scale\n\n\nBut very often a lot of people talk about entrepreneur they talk\nabout this side\n\n\nThey forgot about this acquired knowledge\n\n\nNot many of us are so lucky that the we can leave school you know\nif we don't feel studying right for we still have to acquire some knowledge\n\n\nAnd this knowledge is really to help the entrepreneur to make\nstructured decision\n\n\nThis is called structured business approach how you plans and\ncontrol your how do you plan and control your company and that's very\nimportant part of entrepreneur\n\n\nHow does a entrepreneur grow\n\n\nAnd once it grow how do you control it\n\n\nIt it's better if you have some basic accounting and legal\nknowledge although if you have money to buy this profession and of course\nlastly it's management skills\n\n\nSo you really need a combination of both to make you a good\nentrepreneur\n\n\nAnd uh what I intend to do today maybe I don't have this ought in\nmaybe share a little bit some of the uh methods or some of the scientific way\nof managing a market\n\n\nAnd uh hopefully those who have this will in complement with your\nknowledge\n\n\nThese are the only two colour charts I have okay the rest is black\nand white\n\n\nI just want to give a brief intoduc introduction of what is market\nmanagement and how's how is it relevant to entrepreneurship\n\n\nI want to introduce the term call meas market measures cookbook\nthis is actually the term we use in IBM on how we look at the market place\n\n\nAnd uh we do a lot im portfolio analysis and uh this is not new\nthose who study financial management right is nothing to do with shares but\nif you manage a market it's actually a portfolio\n\n\nAnd of course how do you integrate of what you have and how you\nimplement in the market place\n\n\nAnd I'll conclude you got any questions\n\n\nSo far in my seminars the first few charts always no problems\nbecause they cannot cannot fault my agenda right\n\n\nNow the content\n\n\nNow what is market management really\n\n\nNow we define it as analysis planning implementation and\nmeasurement of programme design to determine the needs and wants of both new\nand existing target markets\n\n\nNow you have this this term on customer satisfaction right customer\nneeds and wants\n\n\nSo the whole idea of market management is really for you understand\nwho are your target customer\n\n\nThey are the one who buy your good and services\n\n\nI mean without the customer you won't get your salary\n\n\nWithout your customer you won't come?? you won't get your income\nfrom company right\n\n\nSo who what does a customer wants in the market\n\n\nAnd new and existing target markets you have to target\n\n\nI mean we learn a long way in IBM alright in the past when we first\nstarted we are everywhere\n\n\nI mean every high end to the low very low end we are we've maintain\npresence everywhere\n\n\nBut right now we ask ourselves right can we afford it do we have\nthe skills\n\n\nMaybe we are not all things to all people\n\n\nMaybe we should able to segment the market\n\n\nThose that we are strong we shall have a strong segment those who\nare weak and we think it's emerging we should do something about it\n\n\nSo this is whole of concept of market management\n\n\nNow the design customer satisfaction it's only the customer that is\nsatisfied with you then he'll keep on doing business with you\n\n\nIf your customer is not happy they will not come back the second\ntime\n\n\nSo in whatever business that you do your focus is only the customer\n\n\nAnd of course the purpose is to achieve organisation objectives is\nvery simple\n\n\nProfit revenue market share which is very dear to every\norganisation\n\n\nI sleep with it eat with it and do everything else with it\n\n\nRight this this diagram just show that you have the voice of the\ncustomer you listen to your customer what your customer wants alright\n\n\nYou plan you you define your solution how can I meet the customer\nneed the customer has a problem the customer has a need how can I meet that\nneeds\n\n\nHow do I be a solution that against that need\n\n\nAnd how do I deliver it what channels do I deliver it and how do I\nmeasure that whether I'm I succeed or I fail\n\n\nSo in every step in organisation these are the key elements that to\ndetermine whether you are doing a good job in managing the market\n\n\nNow you have blow this up to actually look at a model\n\n\nNow what are customer needs and wants is really how do you how do\nyou go about understanding customer needs and wants alright\n\n\nIt's called opportunity assessment\n\n\nHow do you assess opportunity\n\n\nI mean although I present all these steps to a big company like IBM\nis easy because we have I used to manage a big department of a twenty over\npeople doing nothing but just planning\n\n\nI mean they're just dreamers\n\n\nEveryday come to office sit down there and just dream of things\nlook at market place right\n\n\nBut if you're entrepreneur you're one man show\n\n\nHow do you go about doing it\n\n\nIt's a degree of how much you do but still you have to do\n\n\nYou must know what's the opportunity in the market place right\n\n\nAnd then you say these are the opportunities and ask myself where\nshould I select my market\n\n\nShould I go after a PC market or should I go to a higher edge or\nshould I go to software or should I go to solution\n\n\nEven software should I go to the emerging new technology or should\nI just write a PC programme and put do games for kids\n\n\nSo these are selection of segment\n\n\nWhen once you selected how do you strategize in this segment\n\n\nHow do you go about gaining share\n\n\nHow do you about winning opportunities\n\n\nAnd then you do a segment study\n\n\nSegment study simply say where you are today\n\n\nDo you have the strength\n\n\nDo you have the uh ability to meet the challenges in the market\nplace\n\n\nIf you don't have those strengths how how you go about doing\n\n\nShould you go into maybe a partnership acquire some other companies\nto help you to do it or source solutions right\n\n\nThen you do a you develop a segment plan\n\n\nNow these are these are really a very detail steps in planning\nwhich I don't intend to go into details of it\n\n\nIn fact when I I've been going round the countries to preach these\nand it always takes about three days course and I'm only given one hour right\nso I just want to skim through all these term\n\n\nBut if you have any question please let me know\n\n\nNow once you define the customer needs and want if this a internal\nwe call commitment managements internal planning process how do you go about\nsourcings and development\n\n\nThese are internal organisation plan right\n\n\nHow do you have plan development or how do you offer the solutions\n\n\nAnd how do you gonna start it and I think last week you or the week\nafter next you'll learn some something about funding alright\n\n\nAnd how do you price your products\n\n\nPricing is a very important element as entrepreneur\n\n\nNot everything is priced low\n\n\nI mean we'll learn it a hard way in in the computer industry\n\n\nI think when we you talk about IBM what's what's the first\nimpression you have\n\n\nVery expensive right\n\n\nVery expensive but is it price is is it a main is the main is\npricing the main reason why that we lose share\n\n\nIf I lower the price more will I gain back all the shares\n\n\nIs a very interesting toil on price\n\n\nThen you you have to really know how you deliver your solution\nright\n\n\nWhat is your customer relationship\n\n\nNow in all business you and your customers is very important\nespecially on relationship\n\n\nWhy should your customer buy from\n\n\nYou are similar guys selling the same products\n\n\nSometimes it's the face that matters alright and uh it's important\nyour relationship with your customer and the services you provide\n\n\nWhy should we stress so much on services\n\n\nLike Singapore Airlines for example\n\n\nWhy when they first started how do they say this airline what's\nthe airline what's the difference\n\n\nHow do I differentiate mine product from the other airline company\nin services the in-flight service the Singapore girl alright sarong kebaya\n\n\nSo these are you know all the all the differentiation strategies\nthat SIA has adopted and because services is where the customer see\n\n\nAnd of course you must have a continuous measurement feedback\n\n\nAnd very often the entrepreneur you see a lot small companies\nright it's nothing good for them to to say how well they are doing\n\n\nThey do by gut feel\n\n\nThey look at things that're happening\n\n\nBut really you need have a structured measurement process where\nyou ask yourself where you are today what you want to achieve\n\n\nAnd at the end of the day what is the bottom line that you're\nlooking for\n\n\nAlright so far any question\n\n\nHow do you go about doing a selection process in the market place\nalright\n\n\nNow you have there are three elements that you have to take note\n\n\nOne is the size of the market\n\n\nYou have to know how big is the market place\n\n\nWhat is the structure of the market\n\n\nIs it a very clustered or is it very disperse\n\n\nIs it attractive to go in\n\n\nIf maybe in the industry the PC industry for example every guy is\nlosing money you you come across a very good design do you want to go in\n\n\nWhat kind of activities that settle in the industry You have to do\na lot a bit of sales analysis\n\n\nIs it of is there a lot of opportunity?\n\n\nWho are the customers and keenly who are your competitors\n\n\nBecause you are the small guys right\n\n\nWho are the big guys in the market place\n\n\nBecause if there are big guys in the market you need a lot of uh\nyour strength will be different you need a lot of capital right\n\n\nHow do you how do you go into the market from there and what\nproduct exist in the market \n\n\nYou have to select in your prioritise", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "879375bf-c1ba-4c3a-8aac-fb268b7e2853", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.661216+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nI I hope to be able to to address your question\n\n\nI think which you know is gonna be more interesting and let's have a\nmore interactive sort of a a discussion session\n\n\nUh as you can tell you know from you know from the brief\nintroduction of my experience\n\n\nUh I have worked in many many different areas in terms of you know\nuhm functional areas\n\n\nBut in terms of the group of customers you know that I deal with you\nknow I find that the the SMP you know or the entrepreneurs you know some of\nthem are at least is indeed the most uh exciting and rewarding\n\n\nFrom my point of view it has also been the most frustrating you know\nbecause to deal with these people that have got enough egos that sort of you\nknow roll all over you\n\n\nIf they're successful can be quite a bit of a challenge just uh\n\n\nSo I would be than happy to share with you some of my experiences\n\n\nJust before I start off you know reading so called from my my text\n\n\nUh I work with a number of different people uh including people\nthat have form a company that is for example uh S Tech\n\n\nYou might have heard of it which is a compatible to to Creative\nTechnology that is a lot of my clients\n\n\nUh Kent Hurst you know the direct marketing people has another\nclient of mine you know\n\n\nI have got another client that is an inventor you know that took\nthe simple cable and decided to do something different with it you know\n\n\nUh and the list goes on\n\n\nI work with a number of different people that got some you know\nmarvelous ideas looking at convention businesses and you know having a fresh\nlook at how they would package things uhm\n\n\nSo very exciting and I'm you know hopefully you know uh all that I\nsee in front of me\n\n\nEveryone of you are people have the spirit in you that one day and\nyou gonna go out there and do do your thing\n\n\nBut ladies and gentlemen to start with you recall businessman\nRobert Ng's remarks you know on the virtues on greed\n\n\nI'm sure at the recent Pre-univeristy Seminar that has sparked off\nmuch discussion and debates you know and letters in the press\n\n\nNow I do not intend to be as provocative this evening being maybe\nbeing an accountant you know basically you know I got to be a little bit more\nconservative\n\n\nI'm here only you know to give you some ideas so you can then\nchallenge you know amongst yourself and with me some of these ideas\n\n\nIndeed you know this topic of entrepreneurship and what is it has\ngenerated much discussion you know in terms of you know definition not just\nin Singapore but all over the world it has\n\n\nWhat I hope to achieve today in fact is to leave behind some ideas\nof what entrepreneurship is all about and who the real entrepreneurs are\n\n\nAs you would see later on during the rest of my speech you know\nthis concept of entrepreneurship also changes with the times you know\n\n\nAnd it will change as to how we are perceive you know\nentrepreneurship\n\n\nTen years from today will be different from what we do to uh ten\nyears twenty years thirty years down the road\n\n\nNow in the course of my presentation I'll be drawing from examples\nof real life entrepreneurs to help illustrate my point\n\n\nSome of these people are people I know personally\n\n\nSome are clients whom we have serve while others are personalities\nsuch as Sim Wong Hu of Creative Technology Michael Dell of Dell Computers\nFrederick Smith the founder of Federal Express \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nGood argument\n\n\nI had an argument with you know some of my staff in the office\nabout this concept\n\n\nThe looking at McDonalds in Singapore their introduction of the\nKiasu Burger\n\n\nNow is that entrepreneurship\n\n\nSome would argue yes it's entrepreneurship because you seeing a a\nunique taste there you know\n\n\nSome of the marketing programmes is it entrepreneurship\n\n\nYes creating demand you know it's you know in spite of using in a\nor fix franchise\n\n\nYou adapt to the local market and change it and you grow additional\nbusiness that is entrepreneurship as well \n\n\n\n<$C> \n\nSo I mean you can that if if you are a little adverse or if\nyou are lacking in in in in in in for example capital to take forward an idea\nyou can you know find you know a a company that is you know as enlightened as\nthree M you know and be able to pursue you know even entrepreneurship within\nyou know an organisation\n\n\nBut certainly that's very enlightening\n\n\nSome of these stories are very interesting\n\n\nUh Federal Express for example the way they first started they\nbecame very very successful\n\n\nNow with it went off you know faxes voice-mail\n\n\nWhat is gonna be the next lap for them What's gonna happen to this\ncompany\n\n\nI'm watching I don't know what will happen to them\n\n\nLet's see what will happen to them some of these story\n\n\nSo nothing is forever\n\n\nYou gotta keep changing all the time and this is what\nentrepreneurship is all about you know\n\n\nThe ones with the continue sea of potential customer demand goes up\nthere and satisfies that demand as an idea and be able to convert that idea\ninto reality\n\n\nNow a lot people have ideas now is that entrepreneurship just ideas\n\n\nHow you know I've seen so many people with just ideas\n\n\nBut some people just never convert their dream as they will forever\nbe dreamers\n\n\nI've got some very bright friends mine very clever people mind you\nand you know every a year or so in fact about two years once they sur\nresurface and and I'll ask them what happen to your that last idea you know\n\n\nAnd I know you know nothing has happen\n\n\nAnd they were good ideas because you know he what's lacking is you\nremember the definition of entrepreneur you need the managerial capability to\nsee through as you are\n\n\nJust as important it's not just ideas but do you ever see through\nas important just as important\n\n\nAny other questions\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nI'm going to be very provocative here\n\n\nThe people going ten years from now twenty years from now looking\nat two two sets you know two possibilities\n\n\nIf I have a child that has to be in the job market twenty years\nfrom now in Singapore want of the good life want a comfortable life rewarding\nlife\n\n\nIf you're not sure whether you're going to succeed my answer to the\nquestion be a technician be a good electrician be a good plumber be a good\ncar mechanic\n\n\nYou'll be in good demand isn't it\n\n\nDon't be a graduate forget it if you're gonna be mediocre graduate\n\n\nForget it\n\n\nEither that or be prepared to work overseas not in Singapore\n\n\nSo the time will come when you know must <unclear> word </unclear>\nagree with your proposition now\n\n\nYou want to go through the list of some these people who uh the\nSingaporeans that at least that I know of here\n\n\nYou note the strange thing is that the outcast in the sense you\nknow that has succeed you know a lot of these people that have succeed they\nare outcast damn out and outcast\n\n\nI can tell you that\n\n\nSome of these people our society have you know prejudice you know\nagainst them\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nBecause a lot of them were Chinese educated\n\n\nThey're good technicians but they went to technical school they\ncannot speak properly\n\n\nThey cannot won't and can't get pass an interview\n\n\nYou want to go and get a job with IBM they won't go pass the\nscreening test because they can't speak proper English\n\n\nSo they are force into the situation\n\n\nSo they become very good technician\n\n\nA lot of the entrepreneurs I meet now are people like that\n\n\nWith their technical education Chinese educated\n\n\nThey are force by circumstances to go out there they are clever\npeople\n\n\nThey can see it they can't express it in the lingua franca in the\nbusiness environment here\n\n\nSo they are force to go out there and make it\n\n\nBy doing it themselves they cannot do it with anybody under the\nestablish standards they will never make it\n\n\nSo that's one group of them very interesting group\n\n\nThey're a group\n\n\nLook at these people he is only a you know technical educated he is\nnot a full-fledge engineer to my knowledge\n\n\nAnybody knows he's an engineer\n\n\nI don't think he's an engineer\n\n\nAlfred is not you know\n\n\nHe's very you know very impressive when he stands up to speak he'll\nbe a salesman not\n\n\nI got another client the direct marketing company 'O' levels\n\n\nDefinitely not a graduate\n\n\nHe is a doctor Wong Kai is\n\n\nSo you're right\n\n\nBy and large they are the people that are you know not graduate\n\n\nThey're also you know force by circumstances you know to have to\nstrike it out on their own\n\n\nNow that's one side of looking the other side of course is you know\nI mean you know once you know we we we I chatted with you know this child you\nknow in the office just now\n\n\nAnd then we I have this discussion with you know some of you know\nthe people in my office you know the younger generation so to speak\n\n\nAnd we sort of talk about quality of life and what what you want to\ndo in life you know\n\n\nAnd you know they came up with a very interesting proposition says\nwell the best career you know comfortable life in Singapore if you are\ngraduate recent graduate join the army\n\n\nIn seven years or so you'll be a major\n\n\nYou could be very well paid\n\n\nThere are no wars in this region\n\n\nYou're being well-looked after\n\n\nIt's so comfortable why should I take a risk\n\n\nI mean that's kind of sad you know isn't it\n\n\nBut this is you know this are my you know we hire pretty good\npeople in my organisation\n\n\nAnd these are the people that tell me this there some of these\ndiscussion goes on amongst you know fellow graduates\n\n\nSo any the enlistment officer is just next door for you to sign on\nand say potential majors\n\n\nSo I think you know things will change but I think it's changing\nbecause of the environment changing you know\n\n\nMore graduates you know would have to take the risk you know\nbecause there aren't enough opportunities in Singapore\n\n\nYour bit <unclear> word </unclear> will grow but I think we're\ngrowing more brighter people with greater expectations you know with you know\nhigher educational levels then you know there are jobs for offer\n\n\nWhat's the government trying to say now Civil Service\n\n\nHead count they're holding head counts right\n\n\nIf they're holding head counts they will tell you operation base\nis going to increase\n\n\nSo the Civil Service will continue to take in the bright but only\nthe very very brightest will get in\n\n\nHead counts are not going to increase significantly\n\n\nPrivate sector domestic business in Singapore how far more can we\ngo\n\n\nWe're already maturing four we'll have to settle down to about\nfour to five per cent growth and we would be very lucky over the next maybe\nyou know twenty years or so\n\n\nWhere does it present all these bright young people that are\ncoming onto the market place\n\n\nYou got to be entrepreneurial or be prepared to work elsewhere\n\n\nSo circumstances will change\nICE-SIN:#> Disagree with me please\n\n\n\n\n\nI've given you my views\n\n\nLet's have some other views here\n\n\nI mean I will be more than happy to to encourage you all\n\n\n\n\n\nGood point\n\n\nA very good point\n\n\nI mean you know I'm just to relay you know one of my partners\nspoke at the you know the last you know gathering here \n\n\nSteven Phang came by and after his speech apparently some of this\nyou know students approach him And one student came by with exactly the same\nproblem you know where do you slot you know

{"text": "<$A> \n\nThey are all R and D people\n\n\nThey take the plunge and they make it\n\n\nThe world is fuming <unclear> word </unclear> around R and D people\n\n\nThere's no kidding right and uh this man from uh I think he's uh the\nchairman of a Matsushita or something like that\n\n\nHe says that the creation of product leads to the creation of wealth\n\n\nSo as far as these people you are one of a pillars of success\n\n\nThere are three pillars products marketing and finance\n\n\nSo you have no money you have no market institute go for R and D\n\n\nRight that's how I got started\n\n\nOkay I I'm going to scrap through uh you know we might as well tell\nyou how I got started in R and D\n\n\nIt's just like telling a story you know but uh maybe I just briefly\nrun through it and uh and uh see whether the you know you will get inspired\n\n\nFirst of all I believe I am a inquisitive person very curious\n\n\nI refuse to accept what someone tells me until I try out myself\nokay and I think that is one quality I believe in a R and D person\n\n\nIf you were to accept anything somebody tells you then I think you\nare a forward not a innovative not a leader\n\n\nIn order to be number one you have to lead\n\n\nYou have to come with ideas\n\n\nYou can't just accept okay\n\n\nSo back in school I remember one uh one project that I I did how to\nhow to build a a high voltage converter\n\n\nI know nothing about electronics okay so I had a little magazine\nthat says how you can you can solve or generate a high voltage\n\n\nAnd uh it was like uh using a nail and you will have a front-wire\nand with your next <unclear> word </unclear> break switch in a battery\n\n\nOn outside you have secondary coil so in same place you will\nconnect all this together and put the switch on and off you will generate a\nhigh voltage\n\n\nActually it works but to implement that was difficult\n\n\nSo how will you go about implementing such a a a idea into a pro a\nlocal product\n\n\nSo what I did was I took a bell you know electric bell take out\nexternal wire and wire another coil on the other side\n\n\nIt generates a high voltage a couple of hundred volts and I what I\ndid was I took a bolt and put that into a into the hollow output put a\nmetallic meta uh foil on it connect the two wires to it\n\n\nI had a lot of Playboy magazines uh photograph on top stick it on\nand plug the bolt in my friends\n\n\nSo when they open the bolt they got a very shock of their life\n\n\nSo this is some things that I uh did and there's <unclear> word\n</unclear> R and D\n\n\nThe interest in uh wanting to create product okay\n\n\nSo apparently there's a when I rave on R and D was my my lecturer\nin the universities got me a job in the summer vacation help him to build up\nuh certain uh you products that he was doing\n\n\nI got stuck was interesting you know\n\n\nUh I couldn't sleep I was trying to to you know figure out one day\nor come back to work on Mondays\n\n\nYou are crazy you know\n\n\nSo if you want to do R and D do you have this in you\n\n\nThis is not it's not a nine-to-five job it's nine to three a m\n\n\nSometimes okay so don't tell me I have to go home to have dinner\nwith my mummy or with my girlfriends or boyfriends\n\n\nForget it and if for three years if you want to be really good\nforget about all these social dates\n\n\nJust look at Mister Sim Mister Sim of Creative Technology he's\nstill a\n\n\nI'm sorry I but I guess so he's got no time from girlfriends\n\n\nBut he's such he's on the extreme side okay\n\n\nHe's very wealthy so you don't have to be so wealthy you still can\nhave girlfriends and boyfriends you know\n\n\nSo if you were to ask me why I go into R and D I'll give you two\nanswers\n\n\nFore thing first of all I will say because of interest of an ideal\nof a dream you know that like you fresh out of university\n\n\nI think I know everything you know and go in blow a lot of chips\nyou know come as a you know\n\n\nYou expect the the wires to be zero resistance it's not\n\n\nYou know you think that you can run a a higher crazy uh stuff on\nthe long wires you you fail miserably <unclear> word </unclear> you know\n\n\nSo there are two answers\n\n\nNow I'll say after fourteen years of doing R and D I would go to R\nand D because it give you the opportunity to be your own boss\n\n\nWith that knowledge in you you see I will tell if you leave during\nthis university now or junior colleges now you go out to work two years later\neverything is gone\n\n\nYou'll only retain between three to five per cent of what you're\ntaught\n\n\nYou'll only remember we <unclear> word </unclear> is to I <unclear>\nword </unclear> tower <unclear> word </unclear> I <unclear> word </unclear>\nsaw <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nEverything else what accounts extrapolation all secondary all given\nback to your lecturer\n\n\nYou don't need that anymore\n\n\nIt's all gut feel\n\n\nYou touch the a board you suppose to know where the the the the\nboard is like a doctor you know\n\n\nLet's say I think you've got a slight fever you know something like\nthat\n\n\nOkay this is all gut feel okay\n\n\nAfter a while experience comes in\n\n\nYou look at the board you're <unclear> word </unclear> is on the\nline you have ground problems\n\n\nThe textbook never teach you\n\n\nIt's all hard work\n\n\nSomeone one says successful product of man is ninety-nine per cent\nperspiration one per cent inspiration okay\n\n\nSo you finish nine per cent very fast the ten per cent take you\nninety per cent all the time\n\n\nSo the reason why I would like to see more of you guys go into R\nand D is because it gives you the opportunity uh to first go into any area\nyou want right\n\n\nFrom R and D you can go into marketing\n\n\nYou make a super marketing man\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nBecause you know how to use a soak <unclear> word </unclear> better\nthan anybody else\n\n\nIf you have not done R and D first you go into sales you try to use\na soak in front of a customer you can't even trigger it\n\n\nYou think how your customer feels right\n\n\nIt's that's a fact\n\n\nSo you think that unless you go into say sales three years' later\nbecome a manager\n\n\nBy the time you have given back everything to your lecturer you are\njust like any other person\n\n\nCan be a a accounts student or business student vying for the same\njob\n\n\nWhere is your competitive edge\n\n\nYou have no compete you have no advantage\n\n\nThe only way to stay a to stay ahead is to have that niche a\ncompetitive edge\n\n\nThat's a fact right\n\n\nIf everybody were to say so you want two thousand dollars give him\none two thousand dollars\n\n\nHow can I provide one thousand dollars\n\n\nSo if do R and D you specialise three years later your foundation\nis laid\n\n\nYou can go to sales if you are still good carry on R and D\n\n\nAfter five years you've got a lot products hiding in your mind go\nand see a banker or investor and say I'll like to start a company with you\nand for my share what I do\n\n\nYou put ninety per per cent of the money you give ten per cent of\nthe share free I still get my salary\n\n\nAnd that's it that's how you get started without any money\n\n\nNo that's a fact You ask Mister Sim how he get started\n\n\nHis father runs a grocery shop alright\n\n\nNot many of us have rich fathers alright\n\n\nSo let's say you don't go into R and D that's why I have to go away\nfrom my my my my regret\n\n\nUh I guess it's fine now\n\n\nLet's say you don't go into R and D okay\n\n\nYou spend three years you become five years you'll become a manager\n\n\nBy the time you reach thirty your lifestyle goes up\n\n\nHit thirty-five director of company appointed the the G M or\ndirector of company\n\n\nBy the time you reach forty you're a heavy weight earning twelve\nthousand fifteen thousand a month\n\n\nWhat have you got\n\n\nNothing basically\n\n\nAll you have is your P R\n\n\nWhen recession comes who do you think the boss will sack first\n\n\nNot if you remember nineteen eight-five eighty-six when recession\ncomes right\n\n\nI believe many there are many of you who have parents who may have\nlost the job\n\n\nYou will realise that that's all\n\n\nWhy don't you have the <unclear> word </unclear> <unclear> word\n</unclear> don't <unclear> word </unclear> <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nForget about being kiasu\n\n\nGo for the try\n\n\nWhat's what's the problem\n\n\nYour five three to five years you fail go and get a job\n\n\nWhat's wrong\n\n\nBut what you've learnt in R and D is yours\n\n\nNobody will take it from you\n\n\nIt's your asset\n\n\nThat's what you need\n\n\nAfter all you know in my my father gave me my education and I\nsomehow I landed in Singapore because of girl\n\n\nAnd uh later on I ended up a Malaysian boy in Singapore went into\nR and D fumble around here and there\n\n\nAnd uh with all this knowledge I met a investor\n\n\nSo I told him an an idea\n\n\nBasically how we got started was this\n\n\nI was running an engineering firm repairing IBM P C's uh AO\ngeneral data general mainframes and uh that sort\n\n\nSo we're having problems trying to repair all this computers\n\n\nWhat we buy in the market is scopes a uh something called huntrump\n<unclear> word </unclear> tractor\n\n\nThat's a V I trace you know\n\n\nAnd we have hundreds of boards every month\n\n\nAnd we got to send the board to the US and that time a PCXT causes\none thousand five hundred bucks per board\n\n\nAnd you got to pay forty per cent to send it back to the US\n\n\nAnd it takes you three months to get it back where in Singapore I\ngot to replace the customer immediately\n\n\nSo how do you run a company like this\n\n\nAnd there's no products in the market that can help us to do that\n\n\nSo with that kind of problem I got my chief engineer to go out and\nstart the company making test equipment that will solve this type of problem\n\n\nSo we got an investor to back us up and we started with a ten\nsquare feet room three person\n\n\nThat other person employed engineer left us after one month\nbecause he felt that we have no prospect\n\n\nSo left two of us\n\n\nSo everything was handmade we called it Rolls Royce alright\neverything was hand hand-wired handmade\n\n\nI still have all this in my office you know\n\n\nI can show you very proudly all hand-wired\n\n\nBut we did have a product\n\n\nWe got to the product was called Supercat\n\n\nSuper because it was super product cat because it was uh\ncomputer-aided tested\n\n\nSo we sold that we sold the product and uh the company running for\na million dollars to an Australian office\n\n\nWe made some money and not a lot and because we we didn't have the\ncapital so the ninety per cent belongs to the investor\n\n\nSo we started another company and this time we were at thinking of\na new product what could come out after Supercat\n\n\nYou see at that you we had no focus you say what is life after\nSupercat\n\n\nAfter producing the product you know like your Lexus what is life\nafter lexus \n\n\nYou know you know that kind of feel",

{"text": "<$A> \n\nGood afternoon uh ladies and gentlemen\n\n\nMy name uh is Ding Hock Hui\n\n\nI'm a senior quantity surveyor from the Quantative Surveying uh\nOffice in P W D\n\n\nSo I'll be talking on uh quantity surveying services if you join uh\nP W D uh as quantity surveyors what you will do in P W D\n\n\nI think most of us are familiar with this uh organisation chart\ntypical projecting uh where you have the client the architect contractor\nsub-contractors as well as a range of uh consultants that uh involve in the\njob appointed by the client to get a project going\n\n\nSo the quantity surveyor as you can see is one of the project uh\nconsultants involve in the job uh assisting the architect\n\n\nAnd you may have other allied professionals like structural civil\nengineers uhm mechanical and electrical engineers as well as uh other\nspecialist consultants could have for interior design consultant <unclear>\nword </unclear> consultant who are involve in the job\n\n\nThis is the project team who will handle the project right from the\noutset\n\n\nThe project team objective basically as far as I can see uh centred\naround uh three areas time control cost control and quality control\n\n\nYou try to get the project completed on time within a specified uh\nprogramme within uh certain budgeted cost as well as to certain uh quality\nstandard\n\n\nAnd what is the quantity surveyor's role\n\n\nBasically is to safeguard uh government financial interest to make\nsure that uh money are well spent for the project\n\n\nAnd also to ensure that the public construction contract are\nprocured in compliance with certain regulations\n\n\nUh which uh the main in purpose of this regulation is to ensure\nthat the projects are procured lah with uh in accordance with uh certain\nrules\n\n\nSo that they are transparent nobody can fault them and uh complain\ncan be uh answered easily\n\n\nWhat then are the Q S functions\n\n\nIf you're employed as a quantity surveyor in P W D these are the\nbasic functions that uh you probably be performing\n\n\nYou'll be making uh cost estimates plans or cost plans for a\nproject\n\n\nYou work the estimated cost for budgeting purposes\n\n\nOnce uh the estimates are approved the money is allocated\n\n\nYou proceed to call tenders that means you prepare your tender\ndocuments\n\n\nYou will uh proceed to call tenders after the documents have been\nprepared lah\n\n\nIn certain cases for large projects you'll have this P Q we call it\nprequalification exercises\n\n\nThat means uh contractors will be pre-qualified tenders\n\n\nWe will narrow down contractors to those who are qualified to be\ninvited to tender\n\n\nAfter tenders are called we have this tender evaluation\nrecommendation of the tender to the client\n\n\nAnd uh after the tenders have been approved it is awarded to the\nsuccessful contractor\n\n\nAnd uh fol following then we have contract documentation uh we\ndocument a contract that will be the basis to to base uh to to work out the\ncontractual arrangement between a contractor and P W D\n\n\nAnd uh after the award of the contract we have contract\nadministration that means uh we will uh make uh interim payment valuation to\nthe contractors whether it's on monthly basis or on a stage payment basis\n\n\nWe also work out the variations that are ordered uh during the cost\nof the work for the purpose of uh cost control\n\n\nWe want to make sure that the the project budget or the contract\nsum is not exceeded\n\n\nWe also finalise the account after a contract is completed uh at\nthe end of the project after <unclear> word </unclear> <unclear> word\n</unclear> certified\n\n\nAnd of course but not the least you see in every contract\ninvariably there will be uh some contractual dispute\n\n\nMaybe uh certain specifications or certain contractual provisions\nare not uh adequately drafted and there will be uh such contract dispute\narising\n\n\nAnd uh as the quantity surveyor for the job uh it is our duty to\nadvice the architects the engineers you see what is the view you see on uh\ncertain aspect regarding the contractor's claims\n\n\nThere right in addition to those basic Q S functions some other Q S\nfunctions that we do for example just now you have seen on the side uh this\ncost information quarterly is a publication of cost information\n\n\nUh which uh we uh make every quarter and which is available for\nsale to the public\n\n\nIn this publication you'll be able to find information like uh cost\nindices of uh tenders or building materials or labour cost\n\n\nSo that the the general industry the construction industry can\nrefer to it and use it as a reference guide you see to let them have a feel\nof uh the trend of prices\n\n\nWhether tender prices are going up or going down or whether\nmaterial prices are going up or down\n\n\nThat's uh cost information quarterly is available for sale to the\npublic and it is published every quarter okay\n\n\nThe next thing we do we also provide uh insurance and compensation\nvaluation for the Commissioner of Land\n\n\nUh this is for the purpose of uh the land acquisition act\n\n\nYou know there is in Singapore we have this uh land acquisition act\n\n\nIf property is uh acquired by the government compensation is\npayable to the land owner at certain pre-determined prices at certain age\nwhether it's nineteen seventy-three nineteen eighty-six\n\n\nWe will be able to be we are able to provide uh advice to the\nCommissioner of Land who's the one acquiring the property\n\n\nWhat is the value of that property at certain point in time whether\nit's nineteen seventy-three or eighty-six or even at current market value\n\n\nFor insurance uh valuation it is for the purpose of uh insuring a\nproperty uh for fire uh for against damage by fire\n\n\nSo this is required before any property is let out to the public\n\n\nWe'll also provide advice on capital grant projects\n\n\nThat means uh this capital grant projects are basically uh Ministry\nof Education uh projects aided-school projects where the government provides\nninety per cent of the funds to this uh aided mission\n\n\nUh since the money the bulk of the money comes from the government\nin building the aided uh schools the mission schools we definitely will have\nto have a say to help uh Ministry of Education uh how to run these projects\nwhat sort of policies to follow\n\n\nAnd we have a team of uh people to sit in these committees to\nadvice the aided school mission uh how projects are to be uh administered\n\n\nThe types of projects that you'll be involved in as a quantity\nsurveyor in P W D you have seen uh some of the slide just now these are some\nof the projects that uh I summarise here\n\n\nCivil for civil engineering projects you have uh projects like road\nexpressways flyovers interchanges underpasses tunnels <unclear> word\n</unclear> bridges walkways\n\n\nAnd uh account for building projects uh you've seen a wide range of\nthem on the slides\n\n\nBuilding projects uh we have schools junior colleges prisons E R C\ndrug-rehabilitation centres airport abdominal <unclear> word </unclear> tree\noffices polyclinics office-buildings\n\n\nSingapore Art-centre that's coming up uh very soon libraries and\nother institu ah institutional facilities like immigration centres police uh\nheadquarters or police post\n\n\nApart from uh the projects that uh you'll be applying expertise\nwhat you're trained\n\n\nYou also we also uh to your training and development needs if you\njoin the service as a quantity surveyor\n\n\nUh opportunities will be given to you to be trained in uh your\nbasic Q S functions uh all those that uh I've uh spoken just now as well as\nuh matters relating to contract law arbitration\n\n\nJust one area that uh further development training and development\nwill be given to you as well as uh in computers uh\n\n\nWe have actually an in in-house uh quantity surveying system uh\nthat helps you to carry out your duties more effectively using computers\n\n\nUh these are on technical uh issues but on management we'll also\nsend our staff for supervisory management as well as uh organisation and\nmethods\n\n\nYou'll be given uh you'll be given opportunities to attend uh\ntraining in these areas\n\n\nThe forms of training you could be attending seminars conferences\nsymposium\n\n\nSymposiums are basically uh a forum where uh the experts will put\nup some papers and they will deliver it at that symposium and you will have\nthe opportunity to participate in those uh discussions and forums\n\n\nOf course uh there's more hands-on uh opportunities in the form of\nworkshop practical attachments\n\n\nYou could be given opportunities to be attached to a foreign firm\nin another country uh for some specific purpose to learn a certain uh area of\nwork practical attachments\n\n\nSometimes you'll also have the opportunity to have study visits\nlike uh for Singapore Art Centre teams of uh professionals of P W D were\ngiven opportunity to visit uh various uh art centres in other countries like\nuh in the U K Europe as well as America even for the development of the\nairport terminal two\n\n\nUh opportunities were also given to those staff who were involved\nin the airport development to visit various airports around the world before\nwe actually uh do our own uh design\n\n\nSo you'll be given opportunity to have practical attachments study\nvisits\n\n\nAnd of course last but not least uh you have this structured\nlearning programme where you can go for your Masters courses M B\n\n\nAs and uh if possible also your P H D\n\n\nOkay that more or less concludes my section on quantity surveying\n\n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nHi I'm Lim Hock Chuan from the Public Service Commission\n\n\nUhm before I start it's good to see you smiling\n\n\nBefore I start can I just have a quick show of hand how many of you\nare from the Architecture School\n\n\nOkay so the bulk of them is for Q S jobs uh\n\n\nOkay uh after listening to my from uhm P W D I'm sure by now you\nhave a good idea of uh the kind of jobs that are available for you as\narchitects as quantity surveyors\n\n\nUhm whether you're involve in uh the design or the cost control of\nsay schools or airport or hospitals or bridges\n\n\nWhether your work entails uh uh design or retrofitting or\nconservation or renovation\n\n\nWhether it's a procurement of contracts or contract administration\nthere is a exciting uh career for you in the P W D either as a architect or\nas a quantity surveyor that will meet your aspirations and qualifications\n\n\nSo these are very good professional reasons why you should join at\nthe P W D but for the next five minutes\n\n\nOr so you I just want to touch on some uh more down to earth reason\nclose to heart reasons why you should join us\n\n\nNow what sort of uh salaries would you are we talking about if you\njoin us uh as a quantity surveyor\n\n\nOkay the present starting salary for a quantity surveyor is a\nthousand eight hundred and eighty for uh ladies and guys who have not done\nnational service\n\n\nAnd for those who have done national service uh presently the\nsalary is two thousand hundred and forty dollars\n\n\nUhm this is the present salary I uh sure that you've heard the\nannouncement made by the prime minister about a month so ago that the civil\nservice salary will be review at the end of the year\n\n\nAnd we look forward to a revision upwards at the end of the year\n\n\nAnd so we could be talking about salaries that are that are a bit\nhigher than these in terms of starting salaries okay\n\n\nNow what about promotional prospects\n\n\nOkay you join us as a quantity surveyor at uh thousand eight two\nthousand one and upon first promotion we are talking about a salary at least\nof three thousand three hundred and twenty-five uh upon first promotion okay\n\n\n\nAnd of course you go up the second promotion it starts from four\nthousand to about five thousand and all the way to uh of the top post which\nis about fourteen thousand dollars But like I used to tell the other group\nthere's only one top post okay Uh so if you don't make it to the top so maybe\nyou're stuck somewhere in the middle I would say about eight thousand dollars\nWell that's that's not too bad okay So this is for the uh quantity surveyors\nHow about architects for the four or five of you who are with us? Because\nyour course is longer uhm you start at a higher salary uhm For those without\nN S you start at two thousand and ten and those with N S two thousand two\nhundred and sixty-five dollars Okay this is your starting salary", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ded13992-2bec-4843-b18e-433fb1406d4d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.664898+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nThank you for coming down uhm today for taking your time off\n\n\nUh I'd like to actually just start off this talk uh by giving you a\nlittle bit of introduction of our company\n\n\nUhm you may heard of Unilever but not of many them as a matter of\nfact would have actually about our organisation\n\n\nUnilever but I'm pretty sure that all of you would have heard about\nthe products that we market and the kind of businesses that we handle in\nSingapore\n\n\nUh if I told you that uhm we are the people who actually manufacture\nand market products like Lipton Walls Ponds Elizabeth Arden and uh something\nlike another three hundred and seventy more products you'll be surprised\n\n\nIn fact uh Unilever is listed in Fortune five hundred as the\ntwentieth largest company in the world\n\n\nWe are we were listed as the most profitable consumer products\ncompany in the world by Fortune five hundred and uh that really makes us to a\nvery large corporation\n\n\nNow just to give you a little bit of background about Unilever\n\n\nUnilever is actually a huge multi-national that is Anglo-Dutch fifty\nper cent owned by London fifty per cent owned by Rotterdam\n\n\nUh in Singapore basically we are a marketing uh operation but we do\nhave a Lipton tea fac uh tea factory in Singapore\n\n\nUh that's one of the reasons why we have also invited uhm some\npeople from Mechanical Engineering will be able to ? ? answers of the day\n\n\nIn fact uh we have been labelled as the tea excellence setter from\nthis region and you you may be surprised that we are actually supplying\nChinese tea to China okay\n\n\nIt's a fact and we we have been labelled as the most efficient\nproduction facility in the world by a by an international uh tea-tasting\nconsulting firm\n\n\nAnd uh that leaves Singapore's uh facility a very small but very\neffective operating unit\n\n\nWe produce something like about three million tea bags a day and uh\nwe amongst our suppliers as I mentioned includes China Taiwan South Korea\nJapan Chile Malaysia Indonesia so on and so forth\n\n\nNow in Singapore we are a we are a set up that that is about uh two\nhundred employees strong\n\n\nUh we about evenly distributed into well fifty per cent into\nmanufacturing and fifty per cent into administrative services\n\n\nUh our operations are basically to as I mentioned market about uh\nthe three hundred odd products that we actually manufacture\n\n\nAnd uh what we what we are basically a marketing driven firm which\nis supported by a sales function as well as personnel and commercial function\n\n\nNow you may have uh you may have heard about our competitive\ncompetitors uh which uh sometime feature more prominently than ourselves\nnamely Procter and Gamble and uh Johnson and Johnson and so on and so forth\n\n\nMain thing is because they do use their company names behind them\nin marketing their products\n\n\nBut Unilever is a completely different set up because we have got\noperations not only in consumer products division but also in chemicals\nspecialty chemicals uh patients?? and uh several other uh several other I\nshould say business ventures\n\n\nWe we we even have finance companies as well as uhm as well as uh\nbank a little bit of a little of finance as well as banking operations world\nwide where we have gone into joint ventures and we have even moved into uh\ninformation technology\n\n\nSo actually Unilever is one company which can offer all of you\ngraduates who'd be coming out next year a pretty good career opportunity as\nwell as placement\n\n\nThe reason is because of as far as Unilever is concerned we've got\none of the best human resource policies uh where we actually plan for\npeople's career advancement three year in advance\n\n\nThen we we know exactly how many people we are recruiting over the\nnext three years how our organisational structure will change over the next\nthree years taking into consideration of the uhm market considerations\n\n\nAnd we've also know exactly who would be moving up when what sort\nof training opportunities we'll be having for each and every employee of ours\n\n\nNow just to go into a little bit about training we are we are proud\nto say that we are one of the fore forerunners in terms of training in\nSingapore\n\n\nWe also expend something like six per cent of our payroll\n\n\nIn fact that was that is the latest figure I just I have just fresh\nout of the budget meeting\n\n\nWe have managed to spend something like about six per cent of our\npayroll on training on employees in Singapore\n\n\nOur training is basically Unilever specific\n\n\nThe reason is because we have got very structured international\ntraining programmes where what we do is that when we hire you recruits into\nour especially management trainees we we we call you new hires as management\ntrainees\n\n\nWhen we hire management trainees into our company what we do is\nthat we put them on the job training for about a year\n\n\nAnd right after that we do identity a main core group of management\ntrainees who we will be willing to invest upon\n\n\nAnd what would happen is that you would be setting up a business\nprinciples' course for that particular group of people uh which exposes them\nto all of Unilever functions\n\n\nNow this is a regional course it's usually held around this region\nuh where it is rotated of course\n\n\nAfter attending this particular business principles' course and we\nwould we would we would evaluate each and every management trainee right\nafter this particular business principles' course which is very very uh\nvigorous I must say\n\n\nIt's a tough two-week programme and once we give uh once we\ncomplete it you'll be out for evaluation\n\n\nNow if you do well in that particular business principles' course\nthen we would then go on to arrange for a swop programme for you where you\nwould be spending six months of your working career in another country\n\n\nWhat we do is that we exchange you for someone else either from the\nfunction or from a different from another country\n\n\nLike for instance if we swop you say with Thai Thailand then a\nperson from Thailand which could be coming down to Singapore take away\nposition and every for six months\n\n\nBasically you'd be on your own you'd be given a budget to manage\nand uh you'd be in a completely immersed into a completely different uh\nenvironment as well as a country\n\n\nNow you may feel a little bit apprehensive about it but uh actually\nthis programme is to get people more mature in their working life and\nexperience\n\n\nIt's to train people to actually independently handle problems and\nuhm get your yourself immerse into the business into a different kind of\nenvironment\n\n\nThat's the main objective behind this programme after which we\nwould chart a specific course of career path for you\n\n\nAnd depending on it you you would be attending at least one\nregional or professional training training programme every two years\n\n\nYou can see that Unilever is one company which actually invests\nhell of a lot on their employees\n\n\nWell as they say nothing is for free right\n\n\nWhy do we invest so much on our people\n\n\nIt's because we demand results from the people whom we hire also\n\n\nIt's because we believe a person cannot be adding on value through\nthe company without the relevant train training via exposure\n\n\nIn fact that's one of the reasons why a few years back Unilever set\nup its own universities\n\n\nWe call it the four acres where we we send our top most and the\nbest employees to be trained in London in Boston or in South America\n\n\nWe've got three universities all over the world\n\n\nIt shows the kind of commitment that we have in our people\n\n\nNow I'd be uh screening?? you a little bit uh uh uh uh corporate\nvideo that uh we actually have involves the people talking about the uhm\ncompany's practice\n\n\nThe kind of exposure that they have\n\n\nThe kind of uh training that they receive and the kind of career\ndevelopment that we have offered to our uh employees shortly okay\n\n\nBut before that I would like to also emphasize that when you work\nwith Unilever you'd have to be internationally mobile not just in the\nshort-term but in the long-term\n\n\nThe reason is because we do believe in exposing people all the\naround not only this region but also the world\n\n\nWe have got several regional coordination office always which is\npretty hungry for people\n\n\nWe're also looking for a lot of people to be placed in China\n\n\nThere's definitely?? whole exciting market and that's where we're\nsending most of our people to\n\n\nIn fact last year we sent three of our top managers over to China\nand this year we'd be sending uh one person over to Mexico\n\n\nAnd we'll to evaluate a few more people to be expatriated to some\nother countries\n\n\nOkay so we do offer people places overseas but that is provided\nthat each employee proves himself to be worthy of that sort of investment and\nexposure\n\n\nNow you may have asked me uh the kinds of career opportunities that\nare available within Unilever as of now\n\n\nNow as of now as of today I'm not looking for any person but I am I\nwould definitely be looking for people when at the at or about the time when\nyou graduate\n\n\nThat would be sometime in February or March\n\n\nAs I said we do have a regular programme of expatriating our\nemployees and when when we expatriate employees we would have opportunities\nfor local graduates to actually fill up those positions\n\n\nAnd that's when when we would like you to apply to Unilever and the\nselection criteria is pretty tough\n\n\nUh I would like I I I would not go into the selection criteria nor\nthe process in which we actually recruit people because it's uh relatively\nconfidential but we do have a structured way of recruiting people\n\n\nBut the kind of people whom we are looking for is number one the\nperson has to have has to be street smart\n\n\nOkay ultimately I was just telling a colleague of mine you know\n\n\nIn fact in fact in the recent recruitment fair uh lots of people\nwere asking me this question\n\n\nUh do I have to be a biz ad graduate in order to be recruited to\nthe marketing department\n\n\nUh the answer to it is no\n\n\nIn fact half of the marketing department is filled with Physics\ngraduates\n\n\nOkay I'm not I'm not suggesting that you have to be a Physics\ngraduate to be uh recruited into my marketing department\n\n\nBut it involves hell of a lot of common sense involves hell of a\nlot of number crunching it involves attraction it involves an articulate and\nclear thinking personality\n\n\nSo do it these are the general qualities that we are actually\nlooking for\n\n\nAnd we are looking for people as I was mentioning in sales\nmarketing commercial which includes financial and management accounting as\nwell as I T information technology as well as to run the production facility\n\n\nAs a management trainee you come in of course you have to be\ntrained to run production facility\n\n\nBut ultimately you would be running the factory in Singapore\n\n\nSo these are the qualities of people calibre of people that we are\nlooking for when we recruit for management trainees for next year\n\n\nOkay now uh what I'll do is that now I I'd play the uh recruitment\nvideo\n\n\nUh it's about fifteen to twenty uh fifteen to eighteen minutes I'm\nknow that it's about eighteen minutes long\n\n\nOkay after which uh I I have a brochures of our my company uh\ndescribing what exactly I have told you as of now \n\n\nAnd uhm perhaps if you have any questions to ask me after that uh\nI'd be more than willing to uh answer you okay", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "0981b32f-0afe-408e-9587-1d76e17eeaef", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.666031+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nFirst of all let me introduce myself and uh what we are here\nfor today\n\n\nWe are we will have a talk uhm\n\n\nWe will have a talk uhm with you and then this will this will be\nfollowed by a video uh uh after the talk\n\n\nAnd then I'll go through a couple of uh uh more detail on this\ncareer talk\n\n\nUhm but first of all I'm Norman Lee\n\n\nUhm I'm a process manager in charge of one of the operating sections\nin the Pulau Bukom refinery\n\n\nUhm uh what's the this talk will be all about I was uh told by my\nPersonnel Department a couple of days ago\n\n\nUhm and they actually ask for a couple of uh people a couple of\nspeakers uh indicating some senior people and some young people\n\n\nI thought they were asking me as a a young person\n\n\nBut actually I was corrected very quickly on that especially now\nnotice all of you in front of me here is uh rather refreshing uh sight\n\n\nOkay now uhm what the talk would uh consist of as I had mentioned\nuh just now would be a a video uh presentation to start with in a couple of\nseconds\n\n\nUh and then we will have a a bit of a a overhead slides after that\n\n\nUnd then we will have another young speaker a true young speaker to\ncome up and uh welcome question and answer questions\n\n\nSo if we can have the lights off please and then uh we can show the\nvideo\n\n\nThat was the uh uh short introduction uhm\n\n\nWhat I will try and do now is just to run through a couple of\n<unclear> word </unclear> with all of you uhm to bring some details to uh\nwhat was talked about during the video\n\n\nLet me first introduce you to Shell Singapore\n\n\nThe Shell companies in Singapore is uh by any standards uh fairly\nlarge uh companies\n\n\nIt has got uh six hundred uh senior staff\n\n\nUh this will be mainly uh graduate uh uh staff and a total of uh a\nthou just under two thousand staff altogether\n\n\nUh in functional division uh in the Shell companies in Singapore\nare made up of uh quite a number of uh diff different parts\n\n\nIn manufacturing the main facilities are all concentrated in the\nPulau Bukom refinery\n\n\nWhat was said on the video uh just now is already a little bit out\nof date in the sense that the Pulau Bukom refinery is the largest uh in the\nwhole Shell Group uh with the recent investment which some of you may have\nseen in the news newspapers\n\n\nCrude oil comes in from from all over from the Middle East from\nIndonesia from East Malaysia and uh basically is refined in in a distillation\nunit in a secondary conversion unit\n\n\nA lot of it is very state of the art technology\n\n\nUh they are also state of the art technology when it comes to the\ncomputer control\n\n\nAnd uh the uh all the sophisticated uh data information systems\nthat we have got on on the refinery\n\n\nUh to support all of this manufacturing facility in on on the Pulau\nBukom vicinity are three main divisions\n\n\nThe engineering division the operational division and technology\ndivision\n\n\nNow as graduates uh you come in uh if you are in the uh civil\nelectrical mechanical uh discipline\n\n\nUhm then you will basically come in to work in one of the\nengineering divisions\n\n\nAs chemical enigineers you will come in to work as technologists\nwho will be uh basically uh looking at uh improving efficiencies and so on\n\n\nSo the whole team you know these three main divisions on Pulau\nBukom serves to run the refinery in an efficient way to maintain the refinery\n\n\nAnd also to look at all all sorts of new projects and new major\ninvestments and so on\n\n\nThen we come to chemicals\n\n\nThe uh chemicals team in uh in Singapore consist of uh selling and\nmanufacturing uh <unclear> word </unclear> intermediate <unclear> word\n</unclear> for petrols for detergents and so on\n\n\nUhm we are in a state of uhm Asia Pacific expansion and uh the\nchemical team is actually on a part of the growth uh market as a <unclear>\nword </unclear>\n\n\nThe graduates uh joining chemicals in Shell would basically be put\nvery quickly into frontline uh development of uh <unclear> word </unclear>\nmarket opportunities not only within Singapore but also in the region\n\n\nSo people will have to be travelling to our London factory to\ndevelop markets and to look for opportunities <unclear> word </unclear> and\nso on\n\n\nNow uhm on marketing uh the marketing function uh in Shell\nSingapore basically I mean all of you see the Shell petrol stations uh along\nalong the roads and so on\n\n\nThat is a large part of the uh marketing uh functions because\neverything to do got to do with uh to go from petrol to diesel to uh L P G\nand so on\n\n\nAnd of course uh even uh detergents uhm and graduates who join us\nin the marketing department\n\n\nYou will be basically running uh will be basically running to\nportfolio customers industrial customers to give them support for their usage\nof products\n\n\nAnd also to develop new areas of uh trading and so on\n\n\nThen we come to uh supply planning\n\n\nNow supply planning is one of those uh activities that we have to\nhave which is mainly stages in the central offices in uh the uh the uh head\noffice in Shell Towers Raffles Place\n\n\nSupply supply planning is very essential for ensuring the whole of\nuh that whole of Bukom refinery is used to its optimum\n\n\nSo all sorts of uh <unclear> word </unclear> deals and products\ndeals are made in supply planning\n\n\nAnd the the uh people there are also looking at how to optimise the\nrefinery\n\n\nNow from the supply planning uh part one could actually jump into\nthe highly uh uh affective uh oil-trading uh uh area\n\n\nWhere you know after one has acted as uh market analyst in supply\nplanning you one can actually go into the tiny uh round-the-clock uh and and\nvery exciting world of oil-trading\n\n\nThen we come to the personnel function\n\n\nShell places a lot of importance on in the human resources\n\n\nSo basically I mean the attention that we've given to making the\nbest out of the people that Shell has is given to the task\n\n\nI mean it's given to the uh uh opportunity of the line managers\n\n\nBut to gauge and to help line managers in uh taking uh to\nfacilitate their functions the the personnel function comes in\n\n\nPersonnel function for those of us who are who are who have a a\ninclination to actually to go into human relation\n\n\nUh and uh and and who would be very interactive with people the\npersonnel function also ex <unclear> word </unclear> extreme amount of\nflexibility\n\n\nGraduates joining us in the personnel function will actually go\ninto uh looking into compensation and job evaluations and and all those\nlittle things behind the scene\n\n\nWe come to the finance functions\n\n\nOf course I mean Shell uh being big the money is also big\n\n\nAnd the money money money all over the place you have got to have a\nwhole bunch of accountants to look after the money to look after the oil to\nlook after the stock\n\n\nSo we have got management accounting we have got uh financial\naccounting and so on so forth <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nSo that is the financial uh area and of course uh last and not\nleast in tune with the Singapore scene of information technology\n\n\nUh Shell is also having all the state-of-art system within its\nwithin its uh environment\n\n\nUhm basically data-processing telecoms uh corporate system\neverything becoming integrated <unclear> word </unclear> team and\n\n\nA team refinery scheduling the oil-trading world would just run uh\nwith uh data at everyone's finger tips\n\n\nSo it is a big challenge in the realm of the information technology\narea\n\n\nI would like now like to touch uh to give you a first of all a\nsummary on the what a career in Shell will actually mean\n\n\nI've given you a little bit of uhm uhm meat which you can take uh\nyour teeth on as far as the actual job content in the various part of the\ncompany\n\n\nBut which ever job the person actually goes into uh in the company\nthere there there is a whole uh system of career planning uh within Shell\n\n\nThe opportunities in Shell as you may see from the size and the\nexpense of the company\n\n\nI mean it being an international company opportunities for\npersonnel growth is uh tremendous\n\n\nUhm not only growth uh within uh Shell in Singapore but uh you know\nto for assignments abroad the ability to travel\n\n\nAnd opportunities to uh to actually get in touch with our\ncolleagues our foreign colleagues\n\n\nThe uh people who join Shell are given early responsibility\n\n\nAnd and this we believe very we believe to be very important for\npeople to feel useful in their job right from the very start\n\n\nTraining we believe in training\n\n\nWe have a regional training uh facilities and we have also got uhm\noverseas uh courses which we we send our graduates and also uh uh staff who\nhave got a certainly number of years to go on all these courses for personal\nuh development\n\n\nWe have a a part of our regular uhm appraisal in order to let\npeople know how well they are doing\n\n\nUhm how how what should they be doing different in order to be\nperform better in the company\n\n\nOur whole our whole appraisal system is in place which uh gives\npeople feedback\n\n\nUh to tell the individual you know they could be from the line\nmanagement and they could be from personnel uhm what exactly you know they\ncan do to be improving themselves\n\n\nI'll touch on this uh uh subject a little bit later and of course\nthe last subject which I'm sure I mean everybody is uh uh has part of their\npriority the salary progression in Shell\n\n\nUh how would I say how would I put out put it <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n\nI mean the uh it is the <unclear> word </unclear> it the\nperformance related uh and potential related pay scale which I hope to touch\non a little bit after one or two slide\n\n\nNow I've mentioned about uh career development uhm quite\nspecifically we talk about a graduate's progrssion uh development programme\n\n\nAnd this is something that we find is extremely valuable for us\npushing uh graduates along the way when they're in the first couple years\nwith the company\n\n\nWe have uh we have the belief that it is important to spot talent\nso that people who are coming in we like to know their of capabilities and as\nearly as possible\n\n\nAnd in doing so we are then in a position to help the uh graduates\nalong their way\n\n\nTheir strengths will be emphasised and their weaknesses will be\naddressed\n\n\nAnd this whole uh uh scheme is basically set up to make use of\ntheir potential uh and abilities\n\n\nNow the uh features of this graduate development programme is that\nevery quarter every three months people will get assessed uh initially and\nfeedback will be given to the people\n\n\nUh and the and then training would actually be also falling in\nplace together with this uh assessment\n\n\nUh later on of course I mean the training would continue right\nthrough the whole uh career\n\n\nI talked about growth and development\n\n\nWe emphasise the exposure we like people to be actually exposed to\nall sorts of different environments\n\n\nWe like people to have we like people to have changing jobs\n\n\nSo we are talking about people who actually go from job to job uh\nwithin uh two to three years and we like people uh to have a broad outlook\n\n\nNow all these beliefs are basically uh driving us to to expose\npeople by sending people around in the region by sending people overseas \n\n\nAnd and this broad is broadens uh we call it broadening\ndevelopment for people will basically put them in in uh positions for future\nsenior management Now I come to the uh perhaps the more meaty issue ah Before\nthe pause gets too long let me continue Uhm for the for graduates joining\nShell we talk about a a monthly salar salary of between two to two thousand\nfive hundred dollars That range would be decided upon uh you know various\ncircumstances like whether you've done N S or whether you are uhm uh whether\nyou are whether you are a trained in a certain way or another", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ea9a4e8e-8063-4287-aa17-d7e7a2610d16", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nGood afternoon\n\n\nI'm from the Faculty of Engineering and uhm for the last forty-five\nminutes before the tea break our group got together\n\n\nAnd for the first twenty minutes what we did was we spent that time\nintroducing ourselves to one another\n\n\nAnd so we ended up with only twenty minutes to talk about teaching\nin large groups\n\n\nIn fact uhm after the first twenty minutes Professor Elton walked\ninto the room and said uh you know which stage of your discussion are you at\n\n\nAnd we said that we just finished introducing ourselves and he was a\nlittle surprised\n\n\nBut we thought that it would be helpful since we were going to be\ntogether for the next few days to get to know a little bit about each other\n\n\nBut for the remaining twenty minutes that we were together we went\naround and said something about what are some common difficulties or\nstruggles we encounter when we first start lecturing\n\n\nAnd we tried to identify some common features or common problems\nwhich were faced by uhm the members in the group\n\n\nI think one area that cropped up was the area of how much material\nto present in a lecture and we had differing views\n\n\nI think there was one member who said that within an hour he tried\nto cover something in the region of thirty to thirty-five transparencies and\nuh the rest of us were a little surprised to say the least\n\n\nAnd someone else expressed a different experience whereby he was\ngiven three hours for a Masters class\n\n\nAnd by the time I think about two hours was through he had finished\neverything so he declared an early end to the lecture\n\n\nAnd so we we talked about how much material one uh needs to present\nand I think this is very much subject dependent and also related to how much\ntime you feel you should dwell on certain parts of your uh transparencies\n\n\nBecause it's probably not possible to say that one transparency is\nequal to exactly uhm five minutes or or less\n\n\nBut the point that was brought up was that in Engineering a lot of\nour work is mathematical in nature\n\n\nSo how does one go about presenting uh mathematical equations or in\na transparency form\n\n\nAnd uh I think we came to a conclusion that it was probably better\nto spend time and explaining something if we were going to present it rather\nthan doing uh half uhm half-baked job of it\n\n\nSo if we weren't going to spend time on it it's probably best not\nto present it\n\n\nThose were some of the highlights of our discussion\n\n\nAnd I think I probably run out of five minutes now so I'll pass you\nto the next person\n\n<$B> \n\nThat reminds me I have to keep my watch five minutes\n\n\nUh we spend a lot of time trying to figure out what to discuss or\nat least that that's something that I do but not what the members did\n\n\nThey chipped in with good discussions and we kind of uh first uh\nagree on uh use of transparencies that is it's something that is a must for a\nlarge lectures\n\n\nIt helps students to uh focus uh on what is being taught\n\n\nAnd the slower students can find that as a guide uhm a route map so\nto speak\n\n\nThen we discussed on the use of notes whether uhm it's a good idea\nto hand out notes to students\n\n\nUh some say it's good because it saves uh students' time in having\nto hunt down the uh uh reference text\n\n\nWhereas some say it's bad because uh that will make students not\nread the textbooks\n\n\nAnd so uhm it was lively discussion and we concluded that uhm\nbasically if you hand out notes uh you should not substitute for a textbook\n\n\nBut should really help student to uh uh use the notes to help them\nunderstand the course better\n\n\nAnd then I concluded by asking if there were some uh secrets that\nsome staff might want to share uh given that Prof Chow has shared with us\nsome secret uh earlier on in a in a lecture\n\n\nAnd a member suggested that if students don't answer question being\nshy as they are you could ask them to write their answers to uh questions\nthat are given out to them on papers\n\n\nAnd then ask them to exchange uh the papers with the colleagues and\nhave someone else read out the answers\n\n\nIn this case you'll prompt them to uh answer the questions and on\nthat note I think we pretty much round up the uh forty-five minutes that we\nhave\n\n\nUhm I'm not sure if I made the five minutes but but these are the\nfew points that I have\n\n\nThank you\n\n<$C> \n\nMy group started off with uh looking at some of the issues in\nuh small groups and uh the reason for this is that's because we are closer to\nuh that kind of teaching especially with the group\n\n\nBut uh there are some pertinent questions that were raised like for\nexample the the students' mentality\n\n\nEspecially when they are looking for setter <unclear> word\n</unclear> answers uh whether this is something they brought into the\nclassroom or they uh took it from the classroom\n\n\nThe other point that was uh raised uhm in this small group teaching\nis that sometimes it is very difficult especially when students found out a\nway on how to specialise in activities\n\n\nUh they divide up their work and then they specialise on that\nparticular part and they present it\n\n\nAnd if it is not their responsibility they will just leave it alone\nand therefore they couldn't keep up with the discussion of the particular\ngroup that presented\n\n\nWhen it comes to large group uh teaching is the problem of sheer\nnumbers\n\n\nAnd the group felt that because of the sheer numbers the personal\ncontact to the students the bonding with the students has been lost\n\n\nAnd uh special efforts would have to be made sometimes even outside\nthe classroom uh to get back this relationship with the students\n\n\nUh because in speaking to the students in a large class a kind of\nrapport will have to be established in order to get the message through\n\n\nAlso in a large class teaching it was found that we need actually\nto have uh the attention of the students\n\n\nAnd the discussion went onto how to have a control of the whole\nclass\n\n\nUh one staff mention that uhm the eye control is very important\n\n\nUhm the other mention that if we are going to get the attention\nthen the we probably may need some rules\n\n\nNow coming to this eye contact I just want to relate a personal\nexperience of mine\n\n\nUhm eye contact is the meeting of eyes but uh sometimes when I\nlecture especially in my early days is more of the meeting of heads\n\n\nUh the reason is this that when I'm writing something on the\ntransparencies the students see my head\n\n\nAnd when I look out they were copying the board and so I see their\nheads\n\n\nSo the sometimes uhm the eye contact is being lost is more the\nmeeting of heads\n\n\nJust to uhm uh round up the uh discussion we also explore the\npossibility of brainstorming as uhm Professor uh Nathan has mention\n\n\nUh but our comment was that if we start off brainstorming and in\nthe middle of a lecture and uh students starts talking to each other it may\nbe very hard to actually stop them\n\n\nAnd if we have a sixty minutes lecture uh we could find that you\nhave a time constraint\n\n\nThank you\n\n<$D> \n\nWell thank you uhm to all the panel members here for their\ninputs\n\n\nUh there are four other groups out there uh can we we have some uh\nfeedback from those groups the panel leaders for those groups before we we\nopen it up all for general discussion\n\n\nWhat about the group uh from the Arts and Social Science group one\n\n\nJohn John Elliot\n\n\n\n\n<$D> \n\nThank you\n\n\nWhat about uh group two\n\n\nGroup two is uh Doctor uh Associate Professor Rahman\n\n<$E> \n\nOkay actually we just uhm went on from where you ended in uh\nyour talk of preparation presentation and reviews\n\n\nUh we had uh Professor Yeo and I prepared some transparencies and\nin the form of the handouts exactly the way we lecture so we were conducting\nthe same thing uhm in advance to discuss\n\n\nTo the three points you had preparation presentation and review we\nhad added two more\n\n\nThe first one was the interest and attitude towards teaching which\nwe felt was a prerequisite to a effective teaching\n\n\nAnd then the lastly some specific issues and problems\n\n\nUhm in these uhm I think in the preparation uh point which was\ndiscussed to considerable length is that we had this uh category in the\npreparation we had several categories\n\n\nKnow your students and audience well and their background and so on\nbefore you can even prepare your lectures\n\n\nAlso you should know your material well and uh the question that\nwas asked\n\n\nAnd it's a very valid question which almost took half of the time\nof the discussion is what happens if you get the subjects which are not your\nexpertise and you are assigned to teach\n\n\nWorse still if you are assigned to teach things at the last minute\n\n\nUh we all agreed that in order to prepare a good effective lecture\nyou need a good amount of time sometimes weeks to get a very good lecture\nready\n\n\nAnd what if three o'clock in the afternoon you are told that this\nis the course you will be teaching next day\n\n\nUhm very valid point probably uhm some lecturers if they are going\nto teach the same course in the next years\n\n\nAnd the following years they can take it alright from next year on\n\n\nI will have a easier time\n\n\nBut if what if their courses keep on changing and they have to face\nthis problem over and over again something which is worth looking into\n\n\nUhm in the methodology section of course the outline was very\nimportant\n\n\nThe handout question was brought in and in the Faculty of Arts for\nexample handouts are very discouraged\n\n\nUhm even though the students love it so what's the compromise\n\n\nAnd I think what we uh came to is the handouts should not replace\nthe lectures themselves\n\n\nUh in our faculty every beginning of the year you'll have uh notice\nboard full of these sale notices\n\n\nThe students are selling notes and handouts from the previous years\n\n\nEven the essays from the previous exam answers and all that sort of\nthing\n\n\nSo if these can be replaced obviously why should the students come\nto the lecture to begin with\n\n\nThey might just buy those and study those and pass the exam\n\n\nUhm presentation and delivery the uhm lecturer's style we went\nthrough these the manner of delivery\n\n\nOne important point which was emphasised during this manner of\ndelivery was to keep the language especially for the first year students\nespecially in our faculty where a lot of our students come from very various\nbackground\n\n\nUhm Business students Sciences students taking Arts and so on and\nthey maybe taking say Geography or whatever\n\n\nAnd they never had Geography before and suddenly they have to face\nthese\n\n\nSo one has to keep the professional language to the minimum and to\nthe level of the poorest the student in the group\n\n\nUhm the use of the audio-visual again uhm many of us show videos or\nthings like that\n\n\nThey have to be more interactive not just passive\n\n\nUhm in the review the feedback we discussed uhm the formal\nfeedback which our faculty has\n\n\nAnd I guess other faculties do too at the end of the year\n\n\nUhm one could debate about the validity of that as far as the\nimprovement is teaching is concerned", "subdomain":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nThank you uh Annie\n\n\nUhm I'm sure you'll all agree with me that uh Doctor Annie Koh has\nprepared us so well\n\n\nUh in her presentation that the task for the uh resource persons\nwere made very much easier\n\n\nWhen I started discussing with my group I used the handout which uh\nDoctor Annie Koh uh circulated\n\n\nWe started with uh question one\n\n\nI uh asked the group to consider question one and from which we said\nwe will then go on to the other questions\n\n\nAs we started on question one we went along and then gradually we\nfound that uh we were moving into so many areas and I lost track of time\n\n\nWhich which means that uhm I have not been quite uh uh uh a very\ngood facilitator in that way uh\n\n\nI lost track of time and before we knew we had only fifteen minutes\nfor tea\n\n\nSo I'll just uh uh summarise a little bit of uh the just the key\npoints that uh my faculty uh has raised they have raised in our discussions\n\n\nA lot of the use of small groups I think uh will there'll be a lot\nof overlaps uh amongst faculties\n\n\nSo what I will uh concentrate upon is uh the use of small groups in\nclinical teaching in the Faculty of Medicine\n\n\nEssentially uh four there are four areas uh in which small groups\nuh can be used\n\n\nOne is in the to try and develop practice practical skills in uh\nthe examination of patients uh not in the at this stage in the first stage\nnot actually examining the patient as such\n\n\nBut uh being taught by the tutor how the procedure can take place\nand so forth\n\n\nUh here a group of size of about six uh is considered uh to be\nabout optimum\n\n\nThe other area in which small groups are used uhm will be in taking\nthe history of patients analysing the history and so forth\n\n\nUh what they call uh clucking <unclear> word </unclear> skills you\ncluck your patients and this is where again uh small groups would be very\nuseful uh to carry on this educational exercise\n\n\nAnd then the other the next area is one of the uh clinical case\nstudies where you look at actual uh not actual you you you're presented with\na a problem uh say asthma or high blood pressure and so forth and you then\ndiscuss with your groups\n\n\nNow of course uh this first three that which I've mentioned they\nare they cover more or less the the same uh requirements that one would want\nfor small groups in I think other areas of teaching as well\n\n\nAnd the last area which I'm going to mention is in the actual\nexamination of patients\n\n\nThis is where we had a lot of discussion and some were very\nentertaining\n\n\nUhm here in the case of actual examination of patients uh it was\nbrought out very clearly that very important is that small group here means\nreally very small groups uh where it boils down to only one or two students\nuh to the patient\n\n\nThe problems of course uh as I mention it I'm sure it'll become\nobvious to you uh patients cannot be inconvenienced too much with too many uh\nstudents looking down at them\n\n\nAnd a particular our colleague in Obstetrics and Gynecology brought\nout a particular problem in that when you are examining uh <unclear> word\n</unclear> it becomes very very difficult for particularly male students\nexamining female students\n\n\nSo this is an area where uh small group really means very small\ngroup\n\n\nUh you can afford to have twenty uhm students uh looking uh uh at\npatients and uh looking at the same patient over and over again\n\n\nUh here this applies equally well to Dentistry because you're\nlooking at the other <unclear> word </unclear> which is uh not very big you\nknow uh\n\n\nSo you can't have uh too many patients uh uh students uh looking in\nthat small little area\n\n\nSo our colleagues in Dentistry uh also reflected that they have the\nsame problem and there in uh lies the uh use of very small groups\n\n\nUh in addition to what I've said uh there are there were some\nsuggestions as to how we could try and reduce this the use of patients to a\nminimum\n\n\nUhm one of which is uh to try and use close circuit T V of various\nprocedures\n\n\nAnd our colleague in Optomology uh uh mention two uh uh uh uhm ways\nthat they go about this\n\n\nOne is they use audio-visual aids\n\n\nThey use actual slides of eye conditions actual slides of pa taken\nfrom patients\n\n\nThey also of course have a problem because very often in an eye\nexamination there is a a a a small light source uh you know into the eye of\nthe patient\n\n\nYou cannot have too many students looking around like that\n\n\nSo they try to overcome uh uh as best as they can while it is not a\nreplacement for actual patient examination it becomes uh uh uh it complements\n\n\nAnd it hopefully you can then reduce the need to expose the student\nuh to uh to too many patient examinations\n\n\nSo they use audio-visual aids either slides of actual condition eye\nconditions\n\n\nOr they also have uh close circuit T V whereby the surgeon is\nactually operating uh the students are watching the operation on T V and the\nsurgeon is in communication\n\n\nSo there is possibility of crosstalk even while the operation is\ngoing on\n\n\nNow the other point that emerged from our discussions is that here\nunlike the use of small groups in uh uh other situations\n\n\nThis is actually an a real situation where the teacher is himself\nuh being observed by the student every moment of his how he relates to the\npatient how he communicates with the patient is now in fact being observed by\nhis students\n\n\nAnd this is where our colleagues felt that this is a situation\nwhere teachers can provide that inspiration and provide or or make himself\nthe role model\n\n\nWe also have heard of uh failures towards this direction\n\n\nWe have heard of cases where teachers have excel as role models\n\n\nSo these are some our problems and uh uh uh the users of uh small\ngroups in the clinical setting\n\n\nWe concluded by uh drawing attention to one point and that is that\nif we are talking about small groups then we should totally avoid using it as\na mini lecture\n\n\nWe consider it a sin uh to use small groups and then making it into\na mini lecture\n\n\nAnd uh we think that you shouldn't earn your salary if that's the\ncase\n\n<$B> \n\nThank you Prof Gwee\n\n\nOh dear I think my salary have been halved already\n\n\nOkay uh Prof Yong will now address us\n\n\nI'm going to keep the questions till after all the panelists have\nthe chance to voice their opinions first\n\n\nProf\n\n<$C> \n\nRight thank you\n\n\nUh good morning ladies and gentlemen\n\n\nUh first uh what I learn from this morning uh is that uh have to\nprovide a road map before you start something\n\n\nSo within the five minutes that I'm allocated I'll spend the first\nminute on telling what is the scope of our discussion\n\n\nThree minutes on what we actually discussed and one minute to wind\nit up\n\n\nNow uh actually originally uh at least from the resource person\npoint of view I plan to actually focus on a few topics that uh Annie has so\nkindly drafted up in in in in a short write up\n\n\nBut later on the participant felt that uh we should just\nconcentrate on the essence of what small group teaching really is\n\n\nAnd uh what we have is that it's remarkable that we have a\nconsensus of opinion within the different departments on actually the\nproblems that we are facing in the Engineering Faculty\n\n\nUh originally the definition for small group teaching we thought we\ncould actually expand it to include uh uh uh lectures with a small numbers of\nstudents as well as tutorial\n\n\nBut uh again we somehow converge to tutorials so really when we now\nthink about small group teaching somehow uh we we are thinking more of\ntutorials\n\n\nNow the consensus is that uh we have uh unfortunately an unhealthy\npractice in the Engine Faculty in the sense that the our our tutorial perhaps\nare slightly different from the way tutorials are conducted perhaps in the\nother faculties like Arts and Social\n\n\nUh the reason is being technical\n\n\nThe a lot of cases involves problem-solving and uh somehow the\ncomments from most of the participants is that the because they are\nproblem-solving uh tutors tend to set deterministic problem\n\n\nIn other words these are basically closed end solutions\n\n\nAnd as a result the what the students does is that uh they'll just\nprobably go up to the board write out the solutions and if the solutions are\nokay no comment\n\n\nIf the solution is not okay the tutor will then start to ask\nquestions\n\n\nPerhaps his uh his uh own colleagues or students will also ask\nquestions\n\n\nBut we felt that that is not a healthy practice\n\n\nUh the real world outside basically is not so deterministic uh it\nis more on tackling open-ended issues which involves a lot of disciplines\n\n\nBut we felt that we are hampered by the by the fact that uh seems\nto be in the system and partly the teachers ourselves are responsible for\nthis system in the sense that from the day year one we give them sets out of\nuh problems with set answers\n\n\nOccasionally with uh solutions given and these are more or less\ntargeted towards an examinated an examination oriented system\n\n\nIn other words we provide tutorials to the examination as an end\n\n\nAnd we thought that again that is an unhealthy practice\n\n\nAnd the problem also compounded by the fact that we have teaching\nevaluation at Engineering Faculty\n\n\nAnd that if the tutor are not do not give the exam give model\nanswers or solutions or to give lecture notes to supplement he'll get a poor\ngrading in his in an evaluation\n\n\nUh so the practice in the first year is such that the uh lecture\nnotes are given to students\n\n\nUh tutorial solutions are given to the extent certain cases model\nanswers are also given\n\n\nAnd the net result is that these text compounded year after year\neven when they reach final-year students who are about to graduate\n\n\nThey are still un answering for lecture notes model answers and\nthis is what we find uh something unhealthy\n\n\nNow we have uh come up with the problems but uh by the time we have\ndiscussed the problems we don't we the time was up we we didn't have much\ntime to look in the solution\n\n\nBut uh what they generally agreed is that this has to be brought up\nthe the philosophy of the the system of conducting tutorial in the faculty\nhas to change\n\n\nSo at this point I can only reassure the participants that the\nmatter we'll bring it up to the our own faculty teaching methodology\ncommittee and also to the faculty administration and we'll what can be done\n\n\nSo on hindsight at least uh this seminar has brought out some some\nnote uh significant problem uh that we face in the faculty\n\n\nNow we have another minor problem was brought up towards the end\nand that was the how do we uh allow how do we prevent students from choosing\ntheir tutorial groups\n\n\nIn other words again the Engineering Faculty we assign our students\nto certain tutorial groups so they may be something like uh ten tutorial\ngroups with ten different lecturers\n\n\nAnd we notice that some students they just move around tutorial\ngroups in preference of certain lecturers\n\n\nAnd of course again this is an unhealthy uh \n\n\nIn certain departments we take attendance to make sure that the\nstudents stay within the group in certain departments they do not follow\nAgain this is a practice that perhaps we we we need probably more time or or\nmaybe some other workshops to resolve this itself Uh that didn't leave much\ntime to to talk anything further It was still general we we however are\nfortunate we focus on something that the that the rest of the departments\nactually have the same problem and as I said this uh so in summary basically\nthe problem is one on on the conduct of the tutorial itself and of the\nexpectation of students to expect model answers and handout and the most\nimportant is that we'll like to change our tutorial from a deterministic kind\nof problemsolving to a more open-ended thinking and this is uh I presume that\nis the theme of of what Annie Koh has tried to say in in the very first\nlecture", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nNow I had elected to speak from here uh for the simple reason\nthat I do not have any transparencies to show\n\n\nNow the final exam in N U S is really an institution\n\n\nAnd I think for even those of us who may not have been educated here\nwe know that as a fact I think uh if not before then by the time you reach uh\nthis point in the uh seminar series you have known that\n\n\nNow the students in the days when the final exam is the only\nyardstick by which they are measure\n\n\nI think they are caught between two resignations\n\n\nLet me explain\n\n\nBefore the exam their motto seems to be or they are rather resign to\nthe fact that the sooner you fall behind the longer you have to catch up\n\n\nSo they operate on that principle and indeed it's a very well uhm uh\nestablished principle\n\n\nBecause from July anywhere from July until uhm February you have a\nlot of time to catch up right if you fall behind soon enough\n\n\nAnd after the exam they are resign to the fact that uh\n\n\nAnd I quote from somewhere education is what's survives when what\nhas been examined has been forgotten right\n\n\nBecause then it's too late to do anything anyway so might as well\nuh resign yourself to that\n\n\nNow this uh very strange phenomena of placing the final exam as the\nfocal point of the year\n\n\nAnd in some sense the whole uh three or four years that N U S\nstudent have uh to spend uh at this campus uh produce a really uh unique set\nof problems for people on both sides of the examination\n\n\nNow I speak not as an educationist and and really I do not have uh\nvery profound thoughts on the subject\n\n\nBut I speak as a person who has come through the system uh mostly\non the side of the staff\n\n\nBecause my my own education is largely not from N U S and uh I hope\nto share some of those with you now\n\n\nNow after have the students have gone through about three of those\nfinal exams or in some cases four\n\n\nI'm sure many of them could almost reside the examiner's injunction\nfrom the microphone right it goes something like blah blah blah blah blah\nblah\n\n\nAnd and then it ends with something like expulsion from the\nuniversity right\n\n\nAnd then after a while I say you may start now\n\n\nI think it's something like that right\n\n\nThat's what I you call anyway and and then they bury their head\nright into their examination paper and they keep going\n\n\nNow why why why do they sit through that and what are the\njustifications for having the exam\n\n\nIn the group discussion that we had just now to my surprise passion\ndo run high uh on why we had examinations and not other form of assessment\n\n\nUhm or rather why are no other forms of assessment use more\nprofitably in our educational process\n\n\nAnd the discussion already <unclear> word </unclear> run to\nnational objectives how we want to play in the big league and so on to\nphilosophical issues and the technical terms that come out baffle even me you\nknow\n\n\nBecause I'm not one of those that understand all the normatives\nsummative <unclear> word </unclear> and whatever uh uh procedures that are\ngoing on examination\n\n\nBut let me say uh in defence of the final exam since uh I have to\nthat the common denominator principle plays a large part and I I firmly\nbelieve in it\n\n\nThe idea is that the level the the plain field should be level\nbecause if you allow uhm the staff members to do their own assessment then we\nknow all the problems that can come out of it\n\n\nI mean I come from the Business Administration Faculty and we do\nhave some continuous assessment components and I must confess that they are\nsome irregularities that uh would not be so prominent in the final\n\n\nLet me just quote a few\n\n\nWhen you have quizzes that are set and not at the same time and on\nthe same place uh you are bound to have some problems with uhm the standards\nbeing different because you know N U S students are so well-informed\n\n\nThey operate in a in a a market of perfect information coming from\nmy faculty\n\n\nIf you give an exam at two o'clock you cannot repeat the same exam\nat four o'clock you know\n\n\nOtherwise they you know you most of the students will get one\nhundred per cent\n\n\nSo because of that you have real problems and then of course you\nknow in the final exam when you grade questions when you are going through\nthe scripts you do not know who are answering the questions unless they use\nspecial kind of colour ink or something to signal to you\n\n\nBut that is usually not the case for continuous assessment you do\nknow except perhaps you make them quizzes uh you do know the and and uh\nstudents are not very happy about that\n\n\nYes you can imagine\n\n\nAnd of course uhm if you conduct quizzes as we do during tutorial\ngroups they are actually very distinct possibility of student cheating\n\n\nSometimes you could almost tell that they are cheating it's just\nthat you couldn't put quite your finger on it\n\n\nBecause you know if they are not really caught red-handed really\nthat's the problem\n\n\nAnd in the final exam much of this is eliminated because everybody\nsits on a a presumably identical uh chair and they during that three hours\nperform and then they walk out and everybody can can see that it's quite fair\n\n\nOr is it quite fair\n\n\nNow let me just mention then in the next few minutes some of the\nproblems that are real and not so much theoretical\n\n\nFirst of all we assume the examiner care about setting a good exam\nor even a fair exam\n\n\nUh what do you mean by good\n\n\nWell we have some exposition on that issue uh during uh Doctor\nPang's uh session and also actually in our group discussion\n\n\nWe have to clarify for student the content expectation right\n\n\nI mean even that sometimes is not done very well uh from my\npersonal experience\n\n\nAnd the fact that the final exam is actually conducted after the\nvarious uhm significant student evaluation process\n\n\nBy that is the time and we are evaluated by students right\n\n\nThe fact that the final exam is after that actually have some\nbearing on the way it's conducted\n\n\nI mean this again I speak from personal experience because somehow\nor other is like they they don't have a they don't have the final say you\nhave the final say right\n\n\nOkay that's one point\n\n\nSecondly there is always the charge that uh it's not a good idea to\nput all the eggs in one basket and we we know all the problem with that\n\n\nAnd thirdly there is uh the mechanics of how the exam is uhm\nconducted\n\n\nNow we talk about a level playing field but you know some student\nhappen to sit below the air-conditioner\n\n\nAnd you you know I have one student who actually was near freezing\nthis time and and you know she said that you know I was feeling so cold so I\nsearched around\n\n\nIn the end I just switched off that particular air-conditioner for\nher okay\n\n\nNow if she didn't do well she has a good reason not to do well\nright\n\n\nAnd you know that students that are nearer the entrance actually\nmight get anything up to one minute more to read the examination\n\n\nYou all know that because it takes a long time to walk from one end\nof World Trade Centre to the other end\n\n\nAnd when collecting the papers and this is something that I raised\nwith the Registrar's Office actually uh once when I was a young energetic\nlecturer\n\n\nThat the the students uh many students do not honour the rule of\nput down your pen or stop writing now whatever the the instructor said\n\n\nAnd they keep writing because they know that nobody get penalised\nfor it\n\n\nThey get the a a back look I mean from the person collecting that's\nabout it\n\n\nAnd I I feel that things can be done about it but but this is a\nreal problem\n\n\nAnd thirdly with technology so advance today or rather lastly you\nhave problem with calculators\n\n\nNow the typical Registrar Office personnel or the typical\ninvigilator cannot tell the difference between a calculator with only four\nfunctions and one that has one megabite of memory\n\n\nAnd at the level where I'm teaching it makes a lot of difference\nlet me tell you that\n\n\nAnd then there is the grading system\n\n\nNow we know uh that the examiner is under very great pressure to\nfinish all the scripts right\n\n\nAnd uh at one time we have got six hundred and sixty student taking\nStatistics in second year\n\n\nAnd to finish that in a short time is a not a easy thing to do\n\n\nAnd so all the concomitant problems about consistency and all that\nall comes in\n\n\nAnd these are real problems too ah\n\n\nUhm and then marks recordings can uh contain mistake in that\n\n\nWe've seen those happening and then uh the grade adjustment is not\nconsistent\n\n\nI mean there is a case uh of uhm a course having about twenty-five\n\n\nAs in one year and the following year has over two hundred As\nbecause of some <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nSo let me uh then come to the last point then\n\n\nReally the problem one of the main problem of examination as uh it\nis conducted in this university for for the final exam is that student have\nreally no way of uh having any feedback from the final exam\n\n\nThe feedback is really only one way\n\n\nSo we talk about trying to make the examination a learning process\n\n\nI mean in theory it's a a good thing to be able to aim for but for\nmany students really it's the bottleneck they all have to go through\n\n\nNow what can be done to solve some of these problem\n\n\nNow that would of course take another half-an-hour but I won't uh I\nwould spare you that\n\n\nI think one possibility is to make it a practice a for at least for\nthe subjects uh which are are what is term objective for the examiner to pose\nsome kind of sketches how things should be solved immediately after the exam\non the notice board\n\n\nBecause I I feel that the learning uh process is incomplete ha if a\nperson went through three hours trying to solve some problems and they're\nnever told what the answer was\n\n\nOf course for certain things you can't I mean trying to comment on\nsome Shakespeare sonnets for instance\n\n\nI mean there is no model answer to that I could well understand\n\n\nBut certain things the answers are clear and we must give the\nstudent a chance to look at what they are now before they forget it before\nthey can say\n\n\nAnd I quote again educationist what survives when what has been\nexamined has been forgotten\n\n\nWe don't want them to say that all the time do we\n\n\nThank you\n\n<$B> \n\nWell as you know my assignment is continuous assessment\n\n\nI would not have any big uh statement to make or big theorem or\ntheory to advance\n\n\nUh what I want to talk about will be some problems uh connected\nwith my own personal experience\n\n\nAnd for that purpose I think it'll be useful if I give if I say a\nfew words about where which department I come from and so on a bit about the\ndepartment\n\n\nI'm from the Department of Mathematics\n\n\nThis department is a very big one with something like hundred and\nfive staff members and we teach about four hundred sorry four thousand two\nhundred undergraduate students every year \n\n\nSome of our courses are huge more than six hundred students and\nour tutorial groups may be as big as twenty-five students involving perhaps\nas many as eight tutors covering forty-two tutorial groups or for the same\ncourse", "subdomain":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nWell I don't know about the rest of you but I enjoyed that\npresentation by Doctor uh Professor Elton immensely\n\n\nAnd the I was reacting right through his uh his uh lecture and I\nwould like to share some of the thoughts with you\n\n\nI think one has to be careful uhm in terms of what we think we can\nachieve at the university or at any institution of learning\n\n\nI believe that education is not confine nor limited to formal\ninstitutions\n\n\nThere are other channels of education in a family in the churches uh\nin community uh organisations and uh life experiences that one goes through\n\n\nSome it may be a little bit unfair to demand of an institution like\nthis that we need all the aims of education that everyone who passes through\nour portals and and uh graduate uh will become quotes unquotes educated men\nand women in the sense that has uh Professor Elton has uh aptly described\n\n\nAs I was listening to him and all the various wonderful objectives\nthat uh we ought to be working for I felt grossly inadequate not up to it\ndisqualified to be the kind of teacher lecturer that can fulfill those\nobjectives\n\n\nI say that not to discourage you but I say that to provoke you into\nthinking\n\n\nYou see let's take a typical lecturer how well qualified is he to do\nthis educating function\n\n\nHe's a graduate like the rest of us maybe he's has first class\nhonours second upper\n\n\nHe goes for a P H D abroad and he's highly specialised in that\nparticular field\n\n\nHis experiences in life limited to campuses a little bit off campus\nemotional some stable some unstable some some in between\n\n\nMentally you know various stages various degrees but you can say of\nhim that he is vitally interested in his subject area immerse in it and is\nand expect in it and developing further expertise in it\n\n\nThen he goes before the classroom\n\n\nHis very first class he expects all the students to be graduate\nstudent level\n\n\nSo he throws all he knows at them and finds that they are totally\nout of depth\n\n\nHe learns over the years that he has to learn to communicate\n\n\nThat he cannot throw the things that he is familiar with and assume\nthat they can pick up like that because there's an idiom there's a language\nof the subject matter that one one has\n\n\nThere are paradigms to learn models uh to emulate and to present\nand theories into which to cramp all the facts that we see around us\n\n\nSo the question is how does he communicate\n\n\nEven the rudiments that he needs to communicate to the students let\nalone motivate them in other areas\n\n\nThen take the viewpoint of the student\n\n\nIs he graduate student calibre\n\n\nIs he of our level that you know we can pick things up like that\nreact to a lecture like that and start thinking of all kinds of ideas\n\n\nThink you must think of the average student\n\n\nAre you communicating are we communicating successfully to the\naverage student\n\n\nI go I measure myself that way\n\n\nAs I lecture I like to look at my students\n\n\nWhen I see them blank looking in in Hokkien they say 'lei boh kiew'\nmeaning can't catch the ball can't catch what I'm saying then I go back over\nthe ground again\n\n\nWhen I see them smiling I say ah I've achieved something and then\nwhen the essays come in in the tutorials when they react then my heart sinks\nagain\n\n\nBecause I thought they understood but clearly they didn't\nunderstand\n\n\nSo I said well I've got to start over again\n\n\nHow do I communicate\n\n\nHow do I communicate to people who are average intelligence\n\n\nNow it doesn't mean that if somebody gets uh average grade or\nmediocre grade that that person is gonna be a failure in life\n\n\nI've witnessed many of my colleagues before third class honours\ngeneral degree\n\n\nBut they went out to be outstanding successes in life\n\n\nWhat made the difference\n\n\nI believe the university provides education outside the classroom\nthe various avenues that are available the societies the clubs\n\n\nI as a student was active\n\n\nI was a debater\n\n\nI was an organiser of forums and so on\n\n\nI took part in forums and I believe that these other extra\ncurricular avenues develop areas of a student that we can't develop and we\nbetter confess that we can't develop them\n\n\nAt the same time too let's recognise that we cannot look after\ntheir emotional needs\n\n\nMany students have emotional problems and I find that uh sometimes\ntalking to them sometimes being able to help them financially or to get them\nto a counsellor is very helpful\n\n\nBecause if they are emotionally in conflict then they can't do well\n\n\nSo there are many many factors many other factors which uh\nProfessor Elton did not mention but within one hour he couldn't he couldn't\nhave mention\n\n\nBut I think we should take all these into consideration and my\napproach would be given our limited resources what's the best we can do\n\n\nBefore we motivate students are we ourselves motivated\n\n\nI have lecturers in the past at Stanford University who openly told\nus told the students\n\n\nI don't get promoted for good teaching I get promoted for good\nresearch so why should I bother\n\n\nNow if if lecturers carry this kind of attitude they're not\nmotivated in teaching\n\n\nThey just come and do everything dot dot dot dot dot\n\n\nDoesn't matter whether half the students are asleep and then\nexamine them set topics and so on\n\n\nYou can get by concentrate on your research and do very well\n\n\nBut what's the result\n\n\nAre we interested in motivating students and how should we go about\nit\n\n\nDo we present a a lecture that is well-rounded A B C D if and but\nand so on all conditions\n\n\nNow if you did that students go to sleep\n\n\nThere's another way of presenting Chicago style\n\n\nGet them agitated excited because you say things that you know they\nthey are not comfortable with\n\n\nBut they don't know how to rebut you and that makes them you know\ngo and look at the books and come out with something\n\n\nThat's why Chicago has produced so many Nobel prize winners okay\n\n\nNow there are different approaches we can use but the main thing is\ncan we interest the students\n\n\nCan we motivate them\n\n\nCan we get them excited\n\n\nYou see we are excited about our areas of interest\n\n\nCan we communicate this excitement to them this enthusiasm to them\n\n\nIf we can I think we've gone a long way\n\n\nThank you very much\n\n\nLet me have my next speaker I don't know how many minutes I took\n\n\nDoctor Andy Hor please\n\n\nWhen the subject of motivating the student was given to me I found\nthat it was a difficult task\n\n\nThe first thing I did was to look at the dictionary what motivation\nmeans and how I would define it for the discussion\n\n\nI have not looked at uh any literature on that the subject\n\n\nI have collected my thoughts as a practising teacher on this\n\n\nSo what I will do is I'll define it the way I feel it's applicable\nfor student learning look at the forms or factors that influence uh student\nmotivation\n\n\nFinally summarise and would make out the case for student\nmotivation in a university setup\n\n\nThe best definition I could make out for motivation is a process of\narousing an interest for action\n\n\nAh that's the way I quote the define it for this purpose because\nthere were other definition\n\n\nThe word is one the meaning are many\n\n\nBut I think this is the one that came closer to motivation\n\n\nThat is motivation is a driving force and this force affects\nstudent learning\n\n\nIt can come instantly or is a slow process but it must be sustained\n\n\nThen only we have motivation\n\n\nThe driving force or the motivation can come from within or from\nithout/result <unclear> word </unclear> for learning to take place\n\n\nBut the external force that we say for motivation must eventually\nbecome within and must be self-generated for learning to go on\n\n\nSo though we say external or internal the external must eventually\ncome internal in the student for sustained uh learning\n\n\nYou might also ask the question why motivate students uh in a\nuniversity setup\n\n\nThey are tertiary students\n\n\nThey are adults\n\n\nIs motivation necessary\n\n\nI feel motivation is necessary because the time a student comes to\nuniversity's very short\n\n\nIt may be three years or five years as in the Medical Faculty\n\n\nDuring that period they are undergoing a transformation\n\n\nIt's a short period you know and during this period of\ntransformation that is as Professor Elton said they are preparing for life\n\n\nWe can influence them so they learn and continue to learn\n\n\nSo there is a need for uh motivation <unclear> word </unclear> in a\nuniversity setup\n\n\nAs an illustration I thought I would take my subject Biology or\nMedicine\n\n\nIf we take a bone cell or how bone is formed and here this similar\none would be a parallel rubic <unclear> word </unclear> learning\n\n\nWe need a cell we need nourishment and we need a stimulus\n\n\nHowever appropriate the cell is unless you have a stimulus and\nnourishment the cell cannot produce bone\n\n\nSimilarly how uh good the student is unless we have the\nnourishment and the stimulus we cannot get our learning\n\n\nSo this is very vital so I thought I would illustrate it that way\n\n\nI shall look at the some of the factors or forms in which I feel\nare important uh for motivation for learning\n\n\nThe first one I take is the teacher as a stimulus or driving force\n\n\nHe must love to teach be committed and be concerned for the\nstudent be inspiring and have a infectious enthusiasm\n\n\nIf you look back uh inspiring teachers have always attracted the\nstudents to their discipline\n\n\nThey do a deeper learning of the subject and they subsequently\ndevoted their life in that discipline whether it is medicine science or art\n\n\nAnd I think that comes through motivation\n\n\nAnd to do motivation you need close contact and that is the form\nit must take between the student and teacher\n\n\nIn addition as it was said earlier they must not put off or kill\nstudent enthusiasm\n\n\nThey must identify the good ones and the bad ones as you said so\nthat we look at the good ones and make them better\n\n\nAnd also identify the ones at risk and see that they do not fall\nby the wayside\n\n\nIn addition I think a good teacher motivates I feel through\ndemonstrating a mind at work uh be it analysis in analysis in synthesis or\nproblem-solving skills\n\n\nAnd this method I feel attracts students to learning and motivates\nthem\n\n\nSecondly I shall consider the role of the faculty and a department\nas a stimulus or driving force for student learning for motivation\n\n\nThough we can say the responsibility for learning is that of the\nstudent and the teacher\n\n\nI think we must also consider in addition the faculty and the\ndepartments have a definite role in motivating\n\n\nNot only must they they have a role it must be very transparent to\nthe student that they are committed to this\n\n\nAnd they must demonstrate this\n\n\nThen it pervades down the whole faculty and the department and\nimproves learning\n\n\nThirdly I want to look at the role of friends peers in the class\nfor motivation\n\n\nOur students are usually motivated by group learning with their\nfriends\n\n\nIt may be while in the class or even outside the class\n\n\nAnd this can trigger and sustain motivation and I feel this must\nbe also be encouraged for motivation\n\n\nFourthly I come to assessment and examination which Professor\nElton touched on as a factor for motivation student learning \n\n\nI think our assessment methods have an impact on students'\nlearning But we must also take into account the students will also learn to\npass examinations Therefore our assessment methods can be changed and geared\nto stimulate a deep learning and in addition to achieving our objectives", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "86fb3c05-69e8-4842-bdfa-cab01498e397",

{"text": "<$A> \n\nCan you hear me \n\n<$B> \n\nYes \n\n<$A> \n\nAlright I think we've lost some people here but no problem\n\n\nIt's their loss\n\n\nUhm today really I would like to spend the next couple of minutes\nintroducing to you Ami Pro the visual wordprocessor from Lotus\n\n\nAnd I hope that after this you would be able to be challenged enough\nto come aboard with package and really be able to create impacting visually\nimpacting docuhments to be able to communicate effectively maybe in your\norganization here\n\n\nUhm in the event that if my voice starts to change or you know\nthings happen to my voice please excuse me because I've got a very bad cold\nat the moment so please bear with me\n\n\nUhm I wanna assure you that the package is exciting so it's not so\ntrauhmatic to stay till you go for lunch alright\n\n\nOkay so basically if I'll just sit here and I'll do the demo and\ntalk at the same time\n\n\nYou have seen 123 for Windows\n\n\nWindows applications\n\n\nBefore we start how many of you are using just DOS wordprocessor as\nopposed to Windows wordprocessor\n\n\nOkay quite a nuhmber\n\n\nSo what I'll do is that uhm because Ami Pro is really power-packed\nwith features I can only I'll just show you some of these power-packed\nfeatures\n\n\nBut at the same time I will like to show you how easy it despite\nits power how easy it is to use\n\n\nJust like uhm just mentioned earlier that it's rated its\ncredibility is there as some of you who've updated to major industry\n\n\nJournals\n\n\nIt's been consistently rated as very easy to use and yet powerful\nwordprocessor\n\n\nBut it runs on Windows so basically I'll just show you a little bit\n\n\nAs you know the menus over here are typical of every Windows\napplications\n\n\nPull-down menus you call it\n\n\nBut for this case you have under text\n\n\nYou have bold and maybe a keyboard command if you're not used to\nthe mouse which I'm using right now\n\n\nSo this is quite typical of Windows applications with its scroll\nbar at the side here and also it's dynamic dated\n\n\nRight at the bottom here where you get information path or even if\nyou don't have the time or watch has the time here\n\n\nNow that's quite typical of wordprocessors\n\n\nThe difference here you see is this Smart icon which Dave brought\nout earlier\n\n\nSmart icons\n\n\nSome people call it templates\n\n\nI call it short-cut keyboard uh or short-cut commands\n\n\nAnd over here it's typical of all Lotus applications in that you\nsee whatever you see here like printer or even right at the bottom here bold\nitalic it's the same picture that you see in 123 for Windows and Freelance\nfor Windows and that is a plus point because the benefit's obvious\n\n\nYou'll be so familiar with these icons when you go into 123 or\nFreelance\n\n\nIt's just a touch of your it's a click of your mouse alright\n\n\nI I wanna emphasize also like for here this icon over here where I\nwould like to customize my\n\n\nI can move into tools customer micro user's setup for Smart icons\n\n\nWell I'll just click here for customization\n\n\nOver here as you know I have a standard icons that depicts you can\nsee the description\n\n\nHere I use this to show the power-packed features of Ami Pro\ncapitalized ruler thesaurus spell checker bookmarks etcetera etcetera\n\n\nI'll demonstrate some of these features later on\n\n\nThere are altogether one hundred short cut keyboards for you to use\n\n\nSo it depends\n\n\nIt allows for flexibility\n\n\nIf you are familiar with let's say you use spell checker all the\ntime you wanna carry just pick it up and drag and put it into your current\npalate\n\n\nYou don't want it pick it up and drag it back alright\n\n\nAnd if this is not sufficient if these hundred icons are not\nsufficient you can actually customize your icons by using the <unclear> word\n</unclear> drawing package that Ami Pro supplies with or other packages\n\n\nSo it's fine and I'll say I'll just move into it and like what uhm\nwe've mentioned I won't touch on it top left bottom or floating\n\n\nI'll keep it as top\n\n\nOkay so the screen here that now I'm going straight into the screen\nor your workspace you call it the views that we have for Ami Pro\n\n\nRight now we're at the working view\n\n\nJust click here\n\n\nWe have full page standard enlarged and facing page\n\n\nWhen I mention just now about visual wordprocessor I will explain\nthe benefits where we could actually when we go into full page mode here you\ncan actually do complete editing here if you required\n\n\nAs you can see unlike some Windows applications that you know that\nthey just go into preview and you can't touch it and you need to print\n\n\nOver here you can actually format it as it looks on a full page\n\n\nThat's the advantage and that's true wysiwig or true visual\nwordprocessor\n\n\nSo that's why we position Ami Pro as a visual wordprocessor because\nwhat you see here is exactly what you print with no catch involved\n\n\nSo if you are familiar with let's go back here\n\n\nUhm one of the key difference you notice here also is that if you\nare doing the traditional DOS wordprocessor everything is just blank and a\nlot of guesswork involved\n\n\nSo over here you actually see whatever it is including the whole\npage here\n\n\nThe green sign here is actually the header and at the bottom over\nhere it's right at the bottom will be the footer which you can also key in\ndirectly alright\n\n\nLet me go through the process of showing how it is easy is to\ncreate let's say a new docuhment\n\n\nSo you go File New\n\n\nAmi Pro actually has predesigned fifty five templates or style\nsheets we call it\n\n\nStyle sheets are actually templates that allows you it\nautomatically formats for you your text and your docuhment\n\n\nSo you might wanna choose maybe uh facts style sheet your contents\nor invoice or letter style sheet or memos\n\n\nThe different memos here and even newsletters\n\n\nLater on I'll show you some of the style sheets which are used for\ndifferent docuhments\n\n\nSo it's definitely quick and easy for you to get on board File New\nand choose the style sheet you're familiar with and just go on\n\n\nSo for example here maybe I'll choose a fact style sheet\n\n\nI'll replace current file\n\n\nI don't know want I don't wanna save\n\n\nThis dialog box here in the user's setup\n\n\nI've set it each time for to prompt me whether I wanna save or not\n\n\nWell you can go into the user's setup and actually have an auto\nsave so that you will not lose your file in case of any power uh you know off\nor things like that\n\n\nSo what it does is now it load up a template and I've picked with\ncontents\n\n\nSo what it does is it actually gives you the templates that is\nwithin a frame and all you need to do is go in there and then start typing in\nalright\n\n\nThis is just an example of a template or a a style sheet\n\n\nI don't want that\n\n\nI prefer something which I've customized just for this demo and\nI've named it lynn memo style which means if you don't want a pre-designed\nstyle sheet you can just use your own style sheet that are customized earlier\nand I say okay\n\n\nWhat it does now is that it've brought out a style sheet here and\nI've actually created a macro\n\n\nIf some of you are familiar with macros and like to play around\nwith it Ami Pro has a very powerful set and it's easy to use macro\n\n\nI've actually put in a macro so that straightaway in a power field\nit brings up the dialog box that asks me who do I want to type this to\n\n\nThis is a my memo and I'll like to type it to let's say my boss\nwhich is uh Casey Leman\n\n\nSorry I've spelt wrongly alright and I say okay\n\n\nAnd it's straightaway the macro goes into next power field bit\n<unclear> word </unclear> ask me sub subject then right now I'm talking about\nthe Annual report\n\n\nSomething and let's go down a little bit here so you notice over\nhere this style sheet happens to have macros that enhances me\n\n\nI don't have to click here to type but if you don't have a macro\nyou can easily just click here and type Casey Leman\n\n\nClick here and type whatever\n\n\nIf you notice over here at the bottom here there is this style\nsheet paragraph styles you call it\n\n\nEach style sheet or each docuhment style you see will be\naccompanied with an assortment of paragraph styles which you can choose from\n\n\nBody text or title header footer and this is predesigned with\ntogether the style sheets\n\n\nGreat <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nI'll show you later you can actually add in your own paragraph\nstyles and it's very easy\n\n\nSo right now when I click over here you notice that it changed to\nregarding if I click over here it's to from <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nSo the cursor movement okay I move this one <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n\nCursor's missing\n\n\nUhm I'll like to apologize here because I've loaded a new mouse\ndriver and it seems to be missing at this point of time\n\n\nSo must have been loaded up here\n\n\nOkay no problem <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nNo the cursor the mouse is there\n\n\nOkay no problem\n\n\nI'm loading up Ami Pro again\n\n\nGuess I was a bit enthusiastic\n\n\nI took it a new mouse driver\n\n\nYou notice when it moves around it changes its size and uh I could\nhave installed it wrongly\n\n\nOkay it's loading up right now\n\n\nI'm using a 386 <unclear> word </unclear> machine right now on a\nlap laptop thirty-three megahertz and okay the cursors go here but File New\nlet me go into it\n\n\nBear with me for a while and I'll go in again to my lynn okay\n\n\nThis style sheet that's calling up like I mentioned its has macros\n\n\nSo you go in again to Casey Leman so I'll just <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n\nAlright\n\n\nAnd over here <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nAlright my cursor is now there\n\n\nOkay this I've just touched this Ami Pro switch kit here\n\n\nI'll talk about it a little later on\n\n\nSomething which a little enhancements which I've loaded up\n\n\nOkay so basically you notice when I click my cursor here it's\nunder Regarding\n\n\nIf I click here automatically it tells you at the bottom here what\nit what paragraph style it is\n\n\nSo if I enter here automatically you remember this paragraph\nsetting but I can easily change it by clicking here to body text alright\n\n\nAnd as my typing is really slow what I'll do is I'm bringing some\ntext under the paragraph format of body text and I put a macro here and it\ntypes in for me so that you guys won't fall asleep\n\n\nSo body text changed now I will like to have bullet and instead of\ntyping again I'm really slow so I do a macro here which invokes typing which\nI've done earlier before this memo\n\n\nAnd what I'll do is that uh bullet I'll go back to my text and\ndraw a <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nSo basically you can see that my docuhment is complete but I'll\nlike to maybe make some changes to formatting\n\n\nSo what I'll do is that I can easily click into this maybe I need\nan indent here I'll click over here\n\n\nYou can see there's a ruler here and once I click on it the tab\nruler comes out\n\n\nSo maybe I wanna hang in indent <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nRight now and I push it\n\n\nHere you notice that you just fall through\n\n\nOr if the tab ruler here over here I didn't make use of any tab\nbut you can adjust and pull across the tab and you can see how easily or\nmaybe you just throw it away \n\n\nOr if you wanna to do it you can put it back on again So this is\nwhat you call direct screen formatting or page formatting which is one of the\nenhancements of visual wordprocessor So the ruler here if you could on and\noff For me I'll like it on because I like to make use of it So again let's\ntake a look how it looks in full page", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "949be39f-25fe-4c0c-807d-7debf9c46254", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.672771+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nThis is the HDTV system and it is uhm eleven twenty five lines\n\n\nIt's double of the NTSC system in in the in the world currently\nusing today because uhm this has got double the resolution of that end\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nThis is the uh NTSC laser disc player which gives the signal compar\ncom comparable to this screen\n\n\nOnly these two can work together you see\n\n\nBecause for the first time Kodak has has done a combined research\nand for the first time experimental uh film transferred through HDTV telecine\n\n\nNormally film is transferred to uh TV as in broadcast video you see\n\n\nBut that is that is on a PAL system in Singapore for instance six\ntwo five lines and that like commercials they usually film it on film and\nthen after that they go through a post-production telecine\n\n\nHow to transfer the film to video and that quality is only six two\nfive lines\n\n\nBut for the first time Kodak is able to transfer film to HDTV\nthrough the HDTV telecine into HDTV format on the laser disc and this crisp\nquality of resolution that you see here is all generated on the film\n\n\nThis particular one is shown on thirty-five mm film and some of the\nfootages that you see are from either movies or from music videos that are\nshot in US and around the world\n\n\nAnd you can see the quality of the colour saturation\n\n\nThere is a particular one which is very very good\n\n\nThis one\n\n\nThis is a music video\n\n\nYou you you can watch the uh the quality the highlights the shadows\nand it's very very clear\n\n\nIf ever any broadcasting uh stations in the world which switch over\nto HDTV maybe maybe Japan or or uh in Europe others will follow see like SBC\n\n\nThey if they tend if they if they sort of like have the intention\nto go towards this direction maybe in ten years' time everybody would have to\nshoot on film to be able to get this quality and in fact as we are talking\nnow a lot of people instead of shooting on video\n\n\nThey are going back to shooting on film even if it's sixteen mm\n\n\nLater on after this I'll show you footages of sixteen mm transfer\nand they are just as good\n\n\nLook at the quality of the\n\n\nNow I'll show you some footages which are transferred from sixteen\nmm film\n\n\nYa this is shown on sixteen mm blown up to thirty-five and\ntransferred\n\n\nYou can see the quality\n\n\nIt's just as good\n\n\nAt the moment it's the first time they did a film transfer direct\n\n\nIt's it's possible\n\n\nIn fact all the laser discs that you see they're all transferred\ndirectly from film to laser laser disc\n\n\nThat's why you can see it\n\n\nYou see currently\n\n\nOh no no no\n\n\nI mean not a lot of people does that but for the first time it's\nable to do a high definition laser disc you see from film transfer so that\nyou see\n\n\nBecause right now nobody is broadcasting in this kind of signal so\nif if you do not have this player there will be no output you see\n\n\nSo no we can't view anything because SBC <unclear> word </unclear>\nbroadcasting <unclear> word </unclear> frequencies and and they are on a\nsystem which is six two five lines PAL and this is not not compatible to to N\nuh to HDTV standard which is twice of that you see\n\n\nSo they for the first time we give you this film transfer to laser\ndisc so that you can view it here to see the crisp quality of film transfer\nto HDTV \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n\nI represent Singapore Telecom International which markets a service\na data communication service called Infonet and Infonet is an ex twenty five\npackage switching network which operates on the ex twenty five protocol\n\n\nNow a protocol is actually a pathway so to speak which transports\ndata from one end to another\n\n\nIn other words if you are in Singapore and you would like to\ncommunicate with someone in Los Angeles in the States for instance you would\nuse your computer type it on a software have it saved and transmitted to a\nmail box and it resides there till the other party in the United States\ndecides to retrieve it\n\n\nNow alternatively we have got another service which calls which is\ncalled a list line kind of service which simply means that you are connected\ndirectly to your user on the other end which wherever it may be around the\nworld and it is transmitted real time immediately\n\n\nIn other words you are connected directly like you're making a\nphone call and it is your data is transmitted directly\n\n\nNow it really depends on what the customer requires\n\n\nIf the customer requires a service which uh is affected by time\ndifferential in other words if you're speaking to London and there's a seven\nand a half hour difference you would want to ensure that your message is\nretrieved received by your counterpart in the United Kingdom\n\n\nSo what you would do is you would subscribe to electronic mail\nservice which essentially means you have you would have an IBM compatible PC\nand buy the software from us\n\n\nThe software would would then be like a postbox where you store\nyour information as in a word processing software much like WordPerfect\nWordStar and nuh put into the network\n\n\nNow once it is in the network your user on the other end could just\nuse the similar the same kind of software that you have in Singapore dial up\ninto the system and retrieve the information\n\n\nNow it sounds pretty technical because I really don't have my uh\nslides at the moment but uh basically it's an electronic mail mail postman\n\n\nImagine that uh on this end you would like to post a letter\n\n\nWhat you do then is to go to the postbox put it into the postbox\nthe postman comes and collects it puts it into his truck drives it to the\npost office where it's sorted and sent to the various districts\n\n\nNow once it has reached the various districts it would then be\ndelivered to the households that have have uh been it has been the letters\nhave been addressed to\n\n\nNow this is similar but in an our service is similar to this\nprinciple except that it is electronically done\n\n\nWhat we do is that instead of the postman we have the software and\nthe software is connected to a modem which is connected to a telephone line\n\n\nNow what you do is you type your information onto the software save\nit it is then transferred by the modem to the telephone line to the network\n\n\nNow in the network that would be your post office your general post\noffice where the information is collated and distributed\n\n\nIn other words it is sorted and sent to the people that you are\naddressing it to\n\n\nNow when your parties on the other end decide to take the letters\nfrom the post office like a PO box they tap into the the network and re and\nbasically get the information from them which means that they get the letter\n\n\nSo that is uh basically how an electronic mail service works much\nlike a conventional post office system except that you don't see it\n\n\nIt is it works through electricity and and what have you the\nelectronic gadgetry that's available in high technology at this point in time\n\n\nIs there anything else that I could uh interest you in beside uh\nthe electronic mail service \n\n\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm okay uh I'll teach you how to uh go go back to the uh\n\n\nYes to lock out uh lock out type L O G O U T okay\n\n\nUhm you have to choose Unix to F T P to Leonis alright\n\n\nYa\n\n\nBecause you have to load the file from the P C to the to the uh to\nLeonis\n\n\nDo I have any files inside\n\n\nI will I will try to F T P some of the files on hard disk\n\n\nF T P means file transfer protocol or file transfer\n\n\nYa file transfer protocol\n\n\nProtocol meaning uh a kind of language lah a language\n\n\nSo user I D for logging on to Leonis\n\n\nYou have to log on to the host first which is uh C C E P Y F for me\nand then password\n\n\nI'm trying to transfer some of the files to the uh Leonis\n\n\nLeonis is the Greek name for lion\n\n\nOkay we are actually logged in already\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nUhm there are a few commands that you need to remember\n\n\nOne is uh okay you must be sure what kind of files you are\ntransferring\n\n\nFirstly uhm firstly is it a binary file or ASCII file\n\n\nUh let's say if you it's a text file text you don't have to specify\nanything right\n\n\nWhat you need to do is uh just uh do a V R R and see if your files\nare there\n\n\nUh sorry\n\n\nThis is uh Leonis host directory\n\n\nUh local directory L D I R list local local directory\n\n\nThis is my H drive\n\n\nWhat how you change how to change to how to change it to B uh A\nsorry\n\n\nTo change it to A what you should do is uh you you type drive\nchange local drive to A okay\n\n\nThat's how you change\n\n\nIf you don't want to change also can\n\n\nWhat you should what you need to do is that you just put A put A\nuhm something something you must specify the path lah\n\n\nYou know what I mean\n\n\nBut uh if you want to leave the directory you have to change it\nokay to see if your A your files is inside diskette before you do any\ntransfer okay\n\n\nUh fail found\n\n\nOkay there are two commands\n\n\nOne is to put one is to get because your F T P from your Nusnet\nright\n\n\nThat means your F T P from P C\n\n\nTo F T P for P C means you want to uh put a file into Leonis\n\n\nThat is called putting\n\n\nSo you put put put A colon file name file name extension alright\n\n\nIf you are already in A colon now you already A colon you have to\nyou don't have to put A colon\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't specify file name default file name same same as the\nuh when it's being transfer over to Leonis you'll be you will have the same\nfile extension okay\n\n\nBut uh you hit double enter means default file name same okay\n\n\nUh not reading because no file there\n\n\nNow what I want to do is uh I will try a file on my H drive which\nI have you see okay\n\n\nSay I try a very small file say uhm uhm no no my confi is not here\n\n\nI will try say three zero three message\n\n\nI hope is a small one alright\n\n\nI put three zero three to Leonis\n\n\nOh dear I must try to change back uh forgot\n\n\nTry to change back to to H okay\n\n\nPut uhm three zero three dot sign S two\n\n\nThat's why I can't teach too much because some people may not be\nable to absorb everything

{"text": "<$A> \n\nGood afternoon ladies and gentlemen\n\n\nWelcome to our Wordstar for Windows Launch\n\n\nUhm today we'll be presenting to you the first ever recipient of PC\nUser Gold Award winner which is of a word itself window\n\n\nAnd today's programme will also include a slide presentation by Mr\nMichael Wee followed by a highlight of today's program a demonstration of\nWordstar for Windows by Ms Irene Khoo\n\n\nIrene will also show you the correct grammar and the bitstream base\nlift which is also binded in our program\n\n\nAfter the coffee break we will have a round of lucky draw and\nseveral announcements\n\n\nSo without further ado I'll like to call upon Mr Michael Wee\nRegional Sales Manager of Wordstar Asia to introduce Wordstar for Windows to\nyou\n\n\nMichael\n\n\nPlease don't please don't stop\n\n\nHi\n\n\nUh it's good to see all of you and it's very reassuring to know\nthat the name Wordstar can still draw this type of interest\n\n\nUh I know that's partly also due to the Windows environment but I'm\nvery very sure that most of you are here because of Wordstar right\n\n\nSay yes\n\n\nLouder\n\n\nYes well we'll try again later afterwards\n\n\nAlright you know many many years ago uh Wordstar was the number one\nin the PC environment where wordprocessing is concerned and if I'm not wrong\nmost of you if not all of you started using Wordstar for the word-processing\n\n\nYes see I told you\n\n\nIt's getting better good but then somewhere along the way uh we\nadmit we slacken a little bit and thereby we let a lot of other competitors\ncame into the picture\n\n\nThey caught up with us and they have also to a certain extent\novertaken us so much so that whenever now people are looking into\nword-processing perhaps one of the questions they will ask is why Wordstar\nand not something else unlike before where is why something else and not the\nWordstar\n\n\nWell for the first part of the presentation I'm going to show you\nwhy you should consider or reconsider Wordstar because we have gone through a\nlot of changes so much so that we we're able to get our windows product out\nin time long before our competitor that is our main competitor\n\n\nI don't like to mention names here but uh I believe you know uh\nwhich one I'm referring to\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nAlright is it a bit too is it a bit too dark\n\n\nNuh\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nAlright because I've got to be able to see my script otherwise I'll\nwon't be able to say what I'm supposed to say\n\n\nAlright don't worry\n\n\nOkay now despite the lapse uh that Wordstar has fallen into we are\nactually still the number two wordprocessing company in terms of the number\nof units shipped\n\n\nAlright we are the number two word-processor for DOS units shipped\n\n\nIt may surprise a lot of you but this is true uh okay\n\n\nJust just before I carry on can those people at the back hear me\n\n\nOh you can hear me but you can't see me is it\n\n\nThis light here\n\n\nOkay can we have this lights\n\n\nIt's much better now\n\n\nCan you still see me but I have a problem here because now I can't\nsee my script but that's alright\n\n\nWe'd I'll just carry on from here uh we have sold over five million\ncopies\n\n\nWe have a strong brand name recognition and I think no one here\nwill dispute that because even though many of you may have been using other\nword-processing software you will still know the name Wordstar\n\n\nWe have a proven distribution engine which I will show you because\nwe have a very wide um distributor network that covers a lot of the countries\n\n\nWe are the nineteenth largest PC software companies in States\n\n\nUh we employ about slightly less than 280 employees\n\n\nOur last year revenue was thirty-five million\n\n\nAlright we take a look at this graph\n\n\nYou'll find that WordStar is number two in terms of its DOS units\nshipped\n\n\nUh the first one of course you can see for yourself\n\n\nI won't tell you too much about that\n\n\nRight we have overseas office in all these countries that you see\nhere\n\n\nVery few very few software companies do have this kind of coverage\nas we do\n\n\nThey they do have distributors all over the world like like we do\nbut they do not have the subsidiaries in this country\n\n\nThe reason why we have set up subsidiaries in all these countries\nis because we realize we have to get close to the consumer\n\n\nWe have to get close to people like in order to react faster to the\nmarket changes in order to know what you people want us to do and thereby\ncome up with something better\n\n\nSo this is a very different WordStar you are looking at now\n\n\nAnd what actually is different in WordStar\n\n\nWell first of all we've now got a new leadership new management\nteam\n\n\nUh if you are familiar or you're aware with the software industry\nin the States Mr Ron Posner has now joined us as CEO\n\n\nMr Posner has a very impressive track record in AshtonTate in\nSymantech\n\n\nNow uh ye when he was there the companies have managed to triple or\nquadruple their earnings during his tenure in the companies there\n\n\nUh we've got a new product strategy of which you'll be seeing this\nthis afternoon\n\n\nWe've also focussed on very aggressive marketing\n\n\nWe've done a lot of very aggressive funding agreement\n\n\nI'm sure you know about it in the past\n\n\nAnd this new management team has taken a different approach\n\n\nWhat Mr Ron Posner is looking at is into software companies that he\ncan buy that will be complementary to the WordStar\n\n\nHah\n\n\nI didn't know that\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nOkay uh complementary products into the WordStar wordprocessing\nenvironment\n\n\nThen we've now also because of this new management team we've\nmanaged to create a a new company image\n\n\nNow product pres product strategy is to build wordprocessing into\ndocument management\n\n\nDocument management basically covers a wider arena of uh what\nwordprocessing is all about\n\n\nDocument management\n\n\nYou'll be talking about desktop publishing\n\n\nYou'll be talking about microfilms\n\n\nYou'll be talking about laser worms and all these kind of things\n\n\nSo we're building wordprocessing into this document management and\nin the near future you'll be seeing more products towards this aspect\n\n\nOf course we'll keep upgrading our DOS product\n\n\nDOS at this present time remains a very important market to us\n\n\nEven though Windows as we all know is getting very popular but in\nterms of the number of installed units DOS by far outskips Windows still \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nYou can and you need to access your uh head office information\nright\n\n\nYou need your head office information at your fingertip\n\n\nAll you need is one-touch tone telephone\n\n\nYou make one phone call you can access your phone messages\n\n\nYou can send phone messages\n\n\nYour electronic mail right\n\n\nYour computer mail can read to you over the phone\n\n\nWe're talking about text-voice conversion\n\n\nIt means it's like your sec your secretary reading the mail to you\nsaying Mr Manager\n\n\nYou know this is your letter blah blah blah blah everything dollars\nand cent\n\n\nHow many thousand dollars\n\n\nHow many cents you know the address and stuff like that\n\n\nIt's very fast\n\n\n Customer: So uh what kind of e-mail system that it can able to\n\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat kind of computer do you have \n\n<$B> \n\nLet's say Bayan buy or Novell Bayang or Novell \n\n<$B> \n\nUh is that IBM compatible\n\n\nWithout a PC\n\n\nIt's a PCC uh\n\n\nIt's IBM compatible\n\n\nI believe Bayang <unclear> word </unclear> is IBM compatible\n\n\nYes uh it connects to IBM computer HP Deck <unclear> word\n</unclear> Unisyss <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nHoneywell NCR\n\n\nA lot of computers\n\n\nEight or nine okay\n\n\nSo so the electronic mail right it can read to you over the phone\n\n\nIf you do not want it to read to you you want it in hard copy\nright that means on paper right you can tell the system send my electronic\nmail all my fax to the nearest fax machine that's closest to me\n\n\nSay for example you're flying on a plane and there is a fax\nmachine on the plane you can tell the system send my electronic mail and the\nfax to the fax machine on the plane itself\n\n\nSo all you have to do is just walk up to the aisle from the to the\n<unclear> word </unclear> fax machine just put there on the plane itself\n\n\nYou can do all that anywhere in the world as long as you have a\ntouch-tone telephone you can access all those information\n\n\nSo the versatile versatility lies in the fact that your elec your\ncomputer mail computer uh fax can be converted into voice or into fax\nanywhere in the world \n\n<$C> \n\nSo uh to make up this system what what are the minimum uh\nsoftware \n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n\nYou you need to buy this product called <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nThe computer is right over there You see the black box over there\n\n\nIt says centigram voice-processing system\n\n\nYou need to buy one of the box\n\n\nThat's it \n\n<$C> \n\nSo this this system is a PC-based system or a \n\n<$B> \n\nThe box is some sort of computer a very specialized computer\n\n\n<$C> \n\nMay have your own uh telephone <unclear> word </unclear> to\nuh sort of \n\n<$B> \n\nYou have a PBX in your office \n\n<$C> \n\nYep ya we have Must we connect to the PBX \n\n<$B> \n\nSure if you it <unclear> word </unclear> connects to the PBX\nthen you integrate everything because PBX is connected to the fax machine\nright VYour fax machine is connected to the PBX \n\n<$C> \n\nBut those whom without a PBX they cannot do all these \n\n<$B> \n\nKey telephone system also can\n\n\nBest is PBX\n\n\nBut key telephone system also can but very basic\n\n\nSo this is very versatile very powerful \n\n<$B> \n\nOkay Thank you \n\n<$B> \n\nMost welcome \n\n\nBK Can you show me this \n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n\nThis is based on uh this is using your <unclear> word </unclear>\ntechnology okay\n\n\nSay for example uhm you your CEO is on the tenth floor and you're\non the fifth floor and your CEO wants to talk to you\n\n\nSo the on your CEO computer there's a box down here that says\nvoice and it has your phone number on it\n\n\nThe CEO takes this pen uh light-pen and hit that box the computer\nwill dial your extension and then you say Yes Mr CEO what can I do for you\n\n\nOkay maybe he will say I want to talk to you about last month's\nsales progress okay\n\n\nSo on uh your CEO will pull out a document from his PC on the\nscreen right the same document will appear on your screen also\n\n\nSo both of you are watching the same document and while you're\nhaving a voice-communica cation through the phone right that means a speaker\nphone you talk to him right at the same time you say Yes Mr CEO I I'm I think\nuh maybe you're looking at this figure\n\n\nAt the same time you can see this is it\n\n\nSo the thing is this is not restricted to just within the building\n\n\nYou can it it can be done uhm different countries\n\n\nSay you're in Singapore CEO is in New York city okay\n\n\nHe'll call you up\n\n\nIt's as though like he's just next to you\n\n\nYou don't have to fly from Singapore to New York city and this is\nvery cheap\n\n\nYou don't have to buy PC and whatever it is\n\n\nUh you already have PC already right\n\n\nUh IBM compatible PC and PS2 or or Ps PS2\n\n\nThere's a few cards you just slot inside it runs <unclear> word\n</unclear> loads some software inside\n\n\nThat is it \n\n\nC2: It's sort of special monitor \n\n<$B> \n\nIt's not\n\n\nThat's a normal printer\n\n\nAll you need is the product is actually only a few cards and some\nsoftware \n\n\nC2: What are the cards that you \n\n<$B> \n\nUhm it's it's it's inside uh \n\n\nC2 Is it in the brochure they gave us at the front \n\n<$B> \n\nNo there's no brochure for this\n\n\nWe're we're just marketing this product we're not sellers\n\n\nWe we just want to okay we want to introduce this product to all\nto the public let people know that this product is available\n\n\nSee the the reason is ISDN is too expensive for most people\n\n\nToo expensive and because it's too expensive nobody wants to use\nit and because nobody want very few people want to use it problem correct\n\n\nSo right now if you tell everybody and we have and we find out\nthat there's a large demand for this then we can immediately lower down the\nISDN offer \n\n\nThis <unclear> word </unclear> technique uh So we're actually\nquite <unclear> word </unclear> C2: What is this product called\n\n<$A> \n\nUh it's called uh ISDN information integrator C2: From which\ncompany\n\n<$A> \n\nIt's uh joint-venture between an American company and\nBritish C2: Not launched yet\n\n<$A> \n\nNot launched yet This one is also not launched it's making\nits debut But uhm it will help uh it will be launched in a few months' time\nHave I explained to you uh this one BK: No\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay Say for example you're an executive on the move right\nand you <unclear> word </unclear> you need some information from your head\noffice at your fingertips and all you need is one touch of telephone you make\none phone-call can access your phone messages you can send phone messages\nThese are just some some of the crazy <unclear> word </unclear> there are\nsome more much much more inside If I just want <unclear> word </unclear>\nelectronic mail It can read to you your electronic mail to you over the phone\nThat means it's converting from text to <unclear> word </unclear> and or you\ncan send uhm you can send your e-mail or your faxes to any fax machine that's\nnearest to you say like you're on you're on a plane there's a fax machine on\nthe plane you can tell the system send the e-mail and the fax to you on the\nplane itself So very very powerful and it makes use of existing facilities\njust like existing facilities you need a few cards right So it make use of\nexisting phone system computer system and a fax machine You already all have\nthese in the office already Right now the problem is they are not integrated\nthey are not talking to each other They are all isolated So if you buy this\nuh product it integrates all these together So your this electronic mail can\nbe converted into voice or converted into text Anywhere in the world you have\na touch-tone telephone can be accessed all these It's very very powerful BK:\nSo this is the phone\n\n<$A> \n\nAny phone BK: Oh any phone\n\n<$A> \n\nYou don't need a special phone A touch-tone telephone that's\nall BK: Thank you\n\n<$A> \n\nWelcome", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n\nWelcome to all of you\n\n\nAh today I will exaggerate more on the PC side because now PC ah\nbecome more and more popular\n\n\nSo of course <unclear> word </unclear> and we hope in Singapore ah\nhave a PC right so we will consider more of this\n\n\nSo introduction to the computer\n\n\nOkay now to a computer I can see here\n\n\nThis is computer right\n\n\nSo this is not black box is a white box\n\n\nNow for all those laymen not technical incline actually it's just a\nmagic black box\n\n\nYou put something in and something will come out right\n\n\nYou you press one key the picture will come out see\n\n\nI I press a key here then another picture will come out right\n\n\nIt look very impressive <unclear> word </unclear> just like\nmagicians okay\n\n\nSo actually computer ah break down convert round the CPU\n\n\nThat's the most important thing\n\n\nThat is comparable to our brain\n\n\nSo so that is computer brain\n\n\nIt's a CPU and maybe consist of what you call ALU is Arithmetic and\nLogic Unit\n\n\nThat means it can do Arithmetics and it can do some low level\nlogically <unclear> word </unclear> logical decision-making okay\n\n\nThen <unclear> word </unclear> controller\n\n\nController just like a traffic-controller\n\n\nSo if you want to read something from somewhere the controller will\nadvise the computer what to do so\n\n\nIf you want to read from floppy-disk it will read from floppy-disk\n\n\nIf you want to write to something some device it will write to some\nother device\n\n\nWhenever to show onto the screen it will show on the screen\n\n\nSo controller will do all the controlling\n\n\nNow then the computer need what you call memory So when you go and\nbuy a computer for example if you ask how much memory you have right\n\n\nSo the basic configuration for example for eighty and 386 machine\n\n\nFor example the basic one will come up with about six hundred forty\nK but some will come with one meg or even two meg or four meg\n\n\nBut whatever increase in the memory you'll have to pay for it\n\n\nIt's not free right\n\n\nNow so we've the internal memory\n\n\nThe function of the controller is to retrive and store data\n<unclear> word </unclear> from the storing devise\n\n\nBy storage devise for example here this one we have quite a number\nof storage devises inside here We got hard disk in here we have a floppy-disk\nin here\n\n\nSo this is a storage devise\n\n\nSo the controller will control all these things and it will\ncommunicate between input and output devise\n\n\nSo this one is output devise\n\n\nThese two the keyboard and the mouse is input device okay so it\nwill control all the these function and it will communicate between the ALU\nand memory\n\n\nFor example computer need to do some calculations they need\ninformation\n\n\nThe information is stored in the memory\n\n\nSo the job of coordinating all these effort is done by ALU and\ncontroller okay\n\n\nThen you can execute instructions written in a programme so\ncomputer will do a very fantastic job but one at a time\n\n\nNow computer unlike human being <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nMy personal opinion computer can never replace human being because\nno doubt we talk about computer intelligent artificial intelligent but\nactually all those intelligent are human intelligent\n\n\nHuman put into the programmes so they become process of certain\ndegree of intelligent but it's all from human\n\n\nSo without man the computer cannot work right\n\n\nThen the control of operation of ALU do all the arithmetic function\ndo logi logical decision-making So the function of ALE occurs as the name\nimply it do arithmetic operations it perform logical operation for example by\nlogical operation means what\n\n\nSuppose you are calculating say sales commission for example so if\nyou make monthly sales below five thousand no sales commission so it's zero\nright so your commission will be zero\n\n\nBut if you make monthly sales between five thousand to ten thousand\ncommission will be 2% of the total sales for example\n\n\nThen if your sales is for ten thousand to twenty commission will be\n4% and so on\n\n\nSo the computer can make some logical decision-making So suppose it\nmake the sales for certain sales executive now it will know how to calculate\nthe sales commission If the sales' below five thousand the commission for\nthat month will be zero okay\n\n\nIf the sales is between five thousand and ten thousand computer are\nsmart enough they will take the total number of sales times 2% and then add\nthis one to your commission and so on\n\n\nSo that is what you call logic operations\n\n\nThen the memory sometime you call this memory right\n\n\nSo you if there is time the computer programmes and then now\n<unclear> word </unclear> it store Now computer actually is just a tool\n\n\nOf course it's more uh what you call attractive and also more what\nshould be more flexible than just a knife for example\n\n\nBut in terms of utility it's just like a tool okay\n\n\nComputer is a tool to help us to carry out our job more efficiently\nin a more productive way so computer is a tool\n\n\nNow how can a computer work without cannot work suppose computer\nyou buy a computer and you pay for say for example two thousand for a\ncomputer you take it home you turn it on you'll <unclear> word </unclear> not\ngoing to work because like if you don't pay for the software it doesn't work\n\n\nIt's just mere piece of hardware sit there and computer have a lot\nof patience\n\n\nIf you don't tell the computer to do the cursor just hang on on the\nscreen that's all and it keep waiting to receive your instruction before you\nmake the first move\n\n\nSo all the computer do it so fantastic right is because of software\n\n\nNow you watch for what you call Science fictions programme lah\n\n\nI mean in TV right\n\n\nSo certain agent want to know other agent's information press one\nbutton all biodatas everything come out right\n\n\nNow the computer cannot do that all that is done by software and\nalso done by human being\n\n\nThat means in order to get all those information you must have the\ninformation first so you may send twenty agents to get all the information\n\n\nThen you need another number of peoples okay to key in all those\ninformation and you need to have a software to retrieve all information and\nshow it on the screen to you right\n\n\nSo all these software programmes are stored in the memory\n\n\nNow computer need to communicate with outside peripherals\n\n\nFor example you have input device for example the standard input\ndevice is what you call keyboard okay and we have a mouse like that and\nnowadays you have a new one call N system\n\n\nNow if you don't want to key in you can just write you'll <unclear>\nword </unclear> understand what you write okay\n\n\nSo that is input device\n\n\nThen you have some output devices\n\n\nThis one is output device it's a standard one <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n\nSo whatever you want to read come to here\n\n\nAnother device for example printer you can print it out\n\n\nWe'll cover the devices\n\n\nSo all these function will go through the CPU\n\n\nCPU will do all the job right print something you want okay just\nlike your mother wants to cook certain dishes go to the market to buy all the\ningredients so ingredient is the input side and ingredient put in the input\ndevice\n\n\nThen the CPU that means already get the instruction how to cook say\nfor example sweet and sour pork for example\n\n\nSo with all our ingredient prepare then every single step will work\nto carry out to cook sweet and sour pork <unclear> word </unclear> right\n\n\nSo output device will store your what dish We have some auxillary\nstorage for example you may have some other thick <unclear> word </unclear>\ndrive you may have\n\n\nFor example okay multi-media you may have CD-Rom everything you can\n<unclear> word </unclear> to have all these\n\n\nAll went through the CPU\n\n\nNow computer is a tool so what are the major characteristic of the\ncomputer high-speed for example\n\n\nTake for example you want to look for some information which\n<unclear> word </unclear> on file then you see manually you go to the cabinet\nlook for the file keep flipping you still could find the information right\n\n\nRight for computer system if you have a good database all I need to\ndo is key in the key words press a button you will immediately give off the\ninformation from the devise okay\n\n\nSo for example nowaday you have an encyclopedia all on CD-Rom so\nyou can check all the reference ah articles by keying some of the key-words\n\n\nYou can immediately get the information out\n\n\nWhereas for manual system you have all volumes of encyclopedia that\nnow you must know which volume to take out\n\n\nThen you have to go to the index to check which page to look\n<unclear> word </unclear> from\n\n\nNow computer can do this in much much higher speed okay\n\n\nThen it can systematically store and retrieve vast volume of datas\nfor example the bank auto-teller right you just if you put your card into the\nah auto-teller machine right\n\n\nThen you just key in your what pin-number and then you key in what\nyou want to get out\n\n\nAll these in a few seconds' time you can get your money from the\nbank already right\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nBecause the bank already systematically store the information in\nthere now\n\n\nHow much you've balance in there\n\n\nSo suppose you have only five hundred inside you key in eight\nhundred it just simply say you have you have insufficient fund right please\ntake back your card suppose <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nAll the information is there so you can systematically store and\nretrieve randomly all the information\n\n\nYou can automatically execute instruction\n\n\nNow the first generation of computer is very terrible\n\n\nIt's all hard wire so they have to wire up wire up right to do one\noperation they have to re-wire Change another operation\n\n\nThey have to re-wire all over again\n\n\nSo make that make the computer very unfriendly very hard to use\nonly those very few technical people know how to operate computers okay\n\n\nBut now the computer today is totally different\n\n\nIt's very friendly\n\n\nAll you need to do is just to the programme in store on any device\n\n\nThen it can read from the device go into the memory and it just\ncarry out the instruction from the main menu\n\n\nSo it automatically carry out\n\n\nThen it'll process logical capability\n\n\nI already explain to you and it is accurate\n\n\nComputer unless a computer go haywire okay it is more accurate\nthan you can expect\n\n\nFor example the computer will store up to fourteen decimals in\nthere okay\n\n\nRight\n\n\nAs you've seen calculators sometime you have to do some rounding\nand so if you have so many intermediate step the end result maybe <unclear>\nword </unclear> rounding will cause you the first digit right\n\n\nDifference okay\n\n\nBut computer is maintain full accuracy up to fourteen digit inside\nand is reliable reliability\n\n\nIf the programme of course if the programme is wrong then of\ncourse you couldn't rely on the computer to give you the result\n\n\nBut if the programme is correct the logic is correct then you key\nin the information it can always reproduce it can reproduce the same result\nover and over again\n\n\nSo ten persons key in the same thing running the same programme\nwill get the same result\n\n\nYou won't get different result okay\n\n\nSo that is reliable\n\n\nSo how does computer solve the problem as we mentioned in software\nright\n\n\nSo for the computer software mainly is in two area one is system\nsoftware the other one is what you call application software\n\n\nNow system software consist of control programme and service\nprogramme\n\n\nNow control programme will do all the necessary complication\nbetween all the devices and between the memory\n\n\nSo if you want to open a data file say my grandparents they will\ngo to the appropriate device read the file out okay\n\n\nSo all these is done by control programme \n\n\nAll the input output side Then you have some call service\nprogramme Now every now and then you need to copy file you need to backup\nfile for example you need to do purge purge all the file all these is come uh\nunder what you call service programme right",

{"text": "<$A> \n\nNow what you see here is the workplace shelf okay\n\n\nUhm these are icons okay\n\n\nWhat you see here are icon\n\n\nYou can move them around using your mouse buttons okay\n\n\nYou can uhm drag them and reposition them and things like the a\nshape like this meant uh folders\n\n\nThis is quite the same as Windows three dot X kind of uhm uh\ninterface where you click and it open uh it's a folder or MacKintosh okay\n\n\nNow I show you what are the differences okay\n\n\nLet me find a scratch disk\n\n\nOkay now for example I want to access uh my drive A the diskette\nthat I've just stuck in okay\n\n\nWhat normally I can do is I go to the command prompt and say A and\nlet maybe fall back\n\n\nBut in in this kind of an object oriented workplace shelf what I\ncan do is I open the drive folder and you can see that these are all the\ndrive I have\n\n\nI have A drive B drive is my uh tape <unclear> word </unclear> I\nhave in my hard disk C D E F partition and I have a C R ROM attached on this\nthis system\n\n\nSo for exmaple like I want to okay this shows what I have in the A\ndrive disk\n\n\nIt's blank now\n\n\nFor example like I want to format the disk I can just click on the\nicon and I got the pop up menu\n\n\nOkay I can just press and clicks and say format\n\n\nOkay and it give me what are the various uh capacity I I'll like to\nformat\n\n\nOkay then I just click format\n\n\nIt'll go formatting\n\n\nNow let's look at the other uhm stuff we have on the desk top okay\n\n\nWe have things like a shredder here\n\n\nOkay which you can creates uh objects I mean you you can delete an\nobject\n\n\nFor example uhm I want trash away this file called tic-tak-toe\n\n\nI can just drag and drop on the shredder and guess what delete\nright\n\n\nThis is quite similar to MacKintosh\n\n\nAnyone is a MacKintosh user over there\n\n\nYa it looks like MacKintosh right\n\n\nYou drag it to the I think MacKintosh is trash trash can okay\n\n\nSo this is delete and let let's look at the DOS uhm folder here\nwhich I have all this dull DOS icon here\n\n\nWhat do I do if let's say if I want to change an icon okay\n\n\nIt's also object oriented right I just have to click the setting\nnotebook for this icon and if this is Lotus and I want to use this icon for\nit I can just drag this and I drop on the current icon box here and guess\nwhat\n\n\nThis icon is changed okay so it's this kind of thing\n\n\nYou don't have to issue command say change icon or you don't have\nto go to the top bar there and pull down your selection ah select icon change\nthis kind of thing\n\n\nSo it's object oriented in this aspects and for example like uhm\nchanging the colour of your uh system object\n\n\nFor example like I want to go to the background okay\n\n\nUh I go to the system setup\n\n\nWhat I need to do is I just open the colour palate the colours are\n<unclear> word </unclear> also object\n\n\nWhat I have to do is just drag the colour and drop onto the place\nwhere I want to change\n\n\nYou can see that the colours change pretty nicely okay\n\n\nAnd to activate programme is just by double clicking of the of the\nicon\n\n\nAnd you'll see that while I was doing all those the formatting is\ndone in the background\n\n\nThis is what I meant by multitasking and it's done\n\n\nAnd for example I want to save a file onto drive B what do I do\n\n\nI can just drag and drop on it\n\n\nFor example this file type A I'll drag and can see that I think the\nA drive should be blinking right\n\n\nIt's not\n\n\nSorry\n\n\nOr I'll choose another file anyway\n\n\nUhm how about <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nYa if if in case for any reason why I can't move this file\n\n\nYou'll see that the no entry sign is there okay\n\n\nNot to worry let me copy something from my E drive uhm let me\n<unclear> word </unclear> save file does not use the text file\n\n\nThat means I can copy\n\n\nCan drag over drag you know hopefully\n\n\nI think it's there\n\n\nIt's there right\n\n\nI think so\n\n\nSo to show that it's there\n\n\nOkay the convix save file is there so but anyway if for any Doser\n<unclear> word </unclear> common command prompt user would like to use\ncommand prompt die-hard\n\n\nThose of you without without seeing the command prompt <unclear>\nword </unclear> there's also O S two command prompt you can use okay\n\n\nAnd from this command prompt you can always uh set\n\n\nFor this is the O S two command prompt and you can open up a DOS\nfile by just saying well then you can go to a DOS environment okay\n\n\nI'll show more of this later\n\n\nOkay uhm like for example like the drive folders I open up\n\n\nYou can also see that it's in a tree form and this the\nsub-directories are all organise in folders also okay\n\n\nSo it is object oriented in this ex aspect\n\n\nNow what I want to show you next is uhm compatiblity of uhm DOS and\nWindow\n\n\nI'l I'll have you got a very clear\n\n\nI mean at least a clear idea of what workplace shelf\n\n\nIt's this shell this moving of icon this creating of icon deleting\nby dragging pulling <unclear> word </unclear> dropping this is what I meant\neasy to use or the or the workplace shell\n\n\nOkay the next topic that I want to go through is the compatibility\nof uhm DOS okay\n\n\nFor I can run things like Word Perfect for DOS okay and I can put\nthem into the background\n\n\nAlright this is DOS Word Perfect running in one window and I can\nrun Lotus one two three and I can put this also in the window form put them\nside by side okay\n\n\nNow by a by being able to run my DOS applications side by side onto\non on the desk on the O S two desk top what does it buy me as a user okay\n\n\nIn the DOS environment or in the simple DOS DOS environment single\ntasking even uhm what you can do let's say you want to copy all this sales\nuhm figures all this figures onto a word processor file what you can do is\nyou can only convert them to a file and then export them in Word Perfect\n\n\nYou have to read those text file in right\n\n\nBut let's say if you run can run them on the desk top side by side\nyou can do simple things like cut and paste right and it hand <unclear> word\n</unclear> enhance the capability of your DOS applications\n\n\nIt's not only the DOS application you can do cut and paste\n\n\nUhm in our office I'm using the comms manager two okay uhm I'm able\nto\n\n\nYou see now in the in the host environment let's say if I want to\nreply to a mail somebody send me a mail okay it's in fax form\n\n\nI want to reply to the mail and I I like to do some quoting so\nnormaly if if I don't don't have O S two cut and paste facility what I have\nto do is I have to copy that mail into a file\n\n\nThen I open up the file I use the text editor to add those arrow by\nthe side\n\n\nThen I close that file\n\n\nI have to evoke that mail and call that file in and then I send\nthat file okay\n\n\nNow in in the host I mean if running on O S two what I can do is I\njust lift <unclear> word </unclear> up that portion of text mark it up in my\nincoming mail okay\n\n\nIt'll click and go into my O S two clip board\n\n\nThen I just have to key into I mean uh respond\n\n\nThen you have have another fresh uhm mailer screen to come up\n\n\nThen I say paste paste onto the same box okay\n\n\nIn that in that case I can do a lot of manipulation and that would\nadd to my capability of my using my prompt my I B M prompt\n\n\nI don't know whether this will give you a good idea or not because\nI think in N U S you just use prompt right\n\n\nBitnet yah\n\n\nFor today's set up here you can see the two machine\n\n\nActually we're trying to do some networking in this room but it was\nnot really successful so we can't do that uh\n\n\nTherefore I just mention this okay\n\n\nOkay cut and paste\n\n\nUh well this is just between the DOS applications\n\n\nNow what I'm going to show is uhm sharing of datas uhm between O S\ntwo and Windows applications\n\n\nWith this I would like to show that O S two can run Windows and of\ncourse it can also share the Windows application data with whatever\napplication that it is running on Windows platform okay\n\n\nSo I'll like to run Excel here\n\n\nThis is Microsoft Excel\n\n\nNow in O S two point O when I run Excel\n\n\nI probably would have to run it in the full screen mode\n\n\nThat means uhm I have to go into the uh Windows Win dot com and\nyou'll see whole whole page of Window\n\n\nBut this application now is running what I call seamlessly on the\nO S two desk top okay\n\n\nThis within this box that you see here is all the Windows kind of\nuh interface the minimise icon into this manner okay\n\n\nNow let's look at an O S two spreadsheet which is the Lotus one\ntwo three\n\n\nBy the way the Lotus one two three release two that this one I'm\nrunning is the thirty-two bit application\n\n\nAnd I'll touch on the benefits of using thrity-two bit\napplications\n\n\nWhere recently there was an article in the Business Times\n\n\nI wonder if anyone read uh\n\n\nIn thirty-two bit we trust or something like that written by Lim\nSin Sin\n\n\nNow this this two spreadsheet is running side by side let me enter\nsome figure onto this uh Excel side\n\n\nJust some simple number\n\n\nLet me block it up and say copy then I edit and I paste link over\nthis side\n\n\nWhat I'm trying to do here is uh is D D E link okay\n\n\nUhm does anybody know what's D Ding D D E link\n\n\nIn the Windows environment there is this called this link called\nDynamic Data Exchange link okay\n\n\nYou're able to share data dynamically uhm between two applications\nand if you change one the other one should change okay\n\n\nNormally what you see happens is between two Windows applications\n\n\nNow I'm showing you is one on Windows the other one is on O S two\napplications and D D E does work okay\n\n\nNow I want to change uhm for example this okay and you see that\nside is eight\n\n\nPerhaps the numbers you can't see properly\n\n\nMaybe I put it into a chart\n\n\nOkay this is uh O S two Lotus one two three's chart then I choose\nthis one\n\n\nUh do I have a three D one\n\n\nHere is a three-D one and can see much better okay\n\n\nSo you can see that the D D E link data is almost instanteous\nupdate okay\n\n\nI'll just like to explain a bit how this is being done so that you\ncan appreciate that this is not actually as simple as what you see although\nyou can see that the update is quite fast\n\n\nFirst when you do the D D E okay the data has to go into a\nclipboard and that went into the Win O S two clipboard first okay\n\n\nThat's the Windows clipboard maintained by O S two \n\n\nNow from there when I do a paste paste link over to a a O S twos\napplication there's another clipboard is being call up and it's active in the\nbackground and we can't see That is the O S two clipboard And information is\npassed from uhm the Excel into the clipboard in O S via <unclear> word\n</unclear> O S two and passed transferably to O S two's clipboard and goes\nout to Lotus one two three's clipboard and all this passing around is\ntransparent to the user and let alone when you save there's a change in value\nall these changes will be go through with this manner okay", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM",

{"text": "<$A> \n\nGood morning everybody\n\n\nIt's nice to see so many people here today\n\n\nI guess when I see so many people here it makes me feel happy\nbecause today what I really aim to do was is to introduce a new hobby to you\n\n\nBut let me start by telling you that I won't be teaching you or\ndemonstrating to you how to paint aircraft and military vehicles\n\n\nWhat I'm interested to do here is to show you how are we going to\npaint models or figures\n\n\nAnd if you look at my showcase over here you'll see figurines of all\nsorts ranging from Aliens Predators Batman the Crow and all sorts of figures\n\n\nIn fact even Star Wars figures if you noticed\n\n\nWhat I aim to do really is to introduce this new hobby to all of you\n\n\nBecause it's a hobby that I hold very dearly to my heart\n\n\nSince I was very young I've always liked toys that allow me to use\nmy imagination and creativity to construct them\n\n\nThat's why I enjoyed playing with Lego and stuff like that\n\n\nBut as I grew older I realised I want to do more with my hands and\nmy imagination\n\n\nAnd I started I started painting Airfix model-kits\n\n\nSeeing that smiles on your faces I know some of you did that too\n\n\nAnd then later on as I watched movies and grow into like popular\nfigures and all\n\n\nI realised that hey maybe I can paint these figures\n\n\nAnd just let me tell you that at the end of the day when you\nfinished painting a figure\n\n\nYou look at it you'll feel extremely happy and a sense of\ngratification\n\n\nIt's extreme and it's wonderful because you have a work of creation\nin your own hands\n\n\nAnd today that's what I'm going to teach you\n\n\nBut I also want to warn you that it may sound very nice if you look\nat the showcases and all the works that you see there\n\n\nBut a lot of people would give up at the beginning stage\n\n\nSo I wonder how many how many of you here will go on to paint an\nactual figure\n\n\nBut we will see we will see\n\n\nDon't worry about this and we will see\n\n\nThe objectives of this demonstration is to first of all we will\nlearn I will show you how to prepare a figure to be painted\n\n\nAnd you'll be surprised to know that sometimes that alone takes up\nmore time than the painting process itself\n\n\nNumber two we will learn how to paint a figure\n\n\nOf course right that's why all of you are here\n\n\nWe will learn techniques like wet brushing dry brushing techniques\nof painting the eyes and other difficult parts of the body\n\n\nAnd even even learning how to use the airbrush\n\n\nThen thirdly I'm going to show you how to improvise\n\n\nHow to make your model your painted model more exciting more alive\nby improvising\n\n\nReady any questions\n\n\nGood if you have no questions let's go on to my first objective\nhere is to teach and to demonstrate to you how to prepare a model for\npainting\n\n\nFirst of all the materials\n\n\nIn your course if to need you will need paints\n\n\nPaints I will suggest uhm you use Tamiya paints or the Testor\npaints\n\n\nThese are special paints that you use to paint models\n\n\nNext brushes\n\n\nBrushes can be bought anywhere but you would need all sorts of\nbrushes\n\n\nYou need the very thick ones like here\n\n\nLet me show you\n\n\nAnd the very very fine ones\n\n\nAnd these fine ones are use for painting very difficult to reach\nareas like the eyes little crevices places like that which we'll show you\nlater\n\n\nNow before you can even use the brush and the paint aha you are\ngoing to need this a putty knife\n\n\nThis is a cutting tool that is very very sharp\n\n\nThere was once when I was trying to cut off cut off some excess\nareas from a figure and I wasn't careful and I sliced through quite a big\npiece of my finger off\n\n\nYah and it's still there now but uhm but it's a grim reminder of\nthe pain I suffered during then\n\n\nSo you have to be very very careful when you use this cutting knife\n\n\nBut it's an essential equipment that you need\n\n\nNext here we have the putty\n\n\nThis putty this white stuff over here is very important because\nit's used to fill up those spaces\n\n\nUhm let me explain this in another way\n\n\nWhen a model-kit is given to you it never comes in a complete it's\nnever fully assembled\n\n\nSo you have to cut off all the excess pieces and assemble them\ntogether\n\n\nNow when you assemble them together using the super glue usually\nthe pieces will not fit snugly or nicely to each other\n\n\nSo what you need to do is to use the putty put it against the area\nthat is connecting the two parts smoothen it up by using water and so on\n\n\nAnd then it'll look complete itself\n\n\nSo this is what a putty is used for okay\n\n\nAnd then we have this interesting powder here\n\n\nIt's actually a cement model cement\n\n\nWe use this cement sometimes to improvise to make bases and\nsometimes we use it even to fill up the figures\n\n\nAll the figures that you see they are hollow on the inside because\nthey are made of vinyl so they are hollow on the inside\n\n\nVinyl would also mean that they are plastic\n\n\nSo they can be molded in a way\n\n\nSo if you want your figure to have weight and to retain the shape\nforever you'll need to fill up first of all the figures with cement\n\n\nWhen this cement dries up the figure will now have retained its own\nshape and it's fully constructed it gives the figure a certain weight\n\n\nAnd it feels it's actually better\n\n\nRight any questions at this point with all the equipment\n\n\nGood now this equipment here is called the airbrush\n\n\nIt's a very expensive equipment uh usually costing about about two\nthree hundreds if you include the that compressor here which is the more\nexpensive equipment\n\n\nAirbrush comes in different grades sometimes they be very cheap\nabout five six dollars but will never last a lifetime\n\n\nWhat I have here is the Testor brush which is fully guaranteed and\nit's very good\n\n\nWell if you start this new hobby of yours you don not need to buy\nthe airbrush at the present moment\n\n\nWhat you can do is that you can use the equipment over here\n\n\nI'll usually rent it out at a very cheap rate of five dollars per\nhour\n\n\nSo if you have any questions you can even ask me during the\npainting process\n\n\nSo you don't need to buy this equipment at home unless you feel a\nneed to\n\n\nAny questions\n\n\nAlright let's begin\n\n\nFirst thing how do you prepare your figure for painting\n\n\nLet me show you\n\n\nIn this packet here we have a figure of Dr Death from Judge Dread\n\n\nThis is the figure usually I show uhm to new students on how to\npaint a figure\n\n\nAs you can see the figure when it comes to you they are in\ndifferent pieces two legs the body the head and the two hands over here and\nyou have a base over here\n\n\nSo the first thing you've to do is to shape is to cut away the\nexcess plastic of the vinyl that you see around the figures especially at the\nends that need to be connected\n\n\nSo let me show you how it's being cut\n\n\nNotice how careful I am\n\n\nTo hold the place hold the place hold the figure at right parts\n\n\nAnd be careful of the knife and not shave off excess not shave off\ntoo deeply into the figure itself and especially not to cut your hands and\nyour fingers\n\n\nRight after we do this the next you'll have to do is that you have\nto remember this is to put all these pieces into a basin and you wash them\nwith detergent or soap\n\n\nNow you may ask why do we need to do this\n\n\nThe reason is because when when the model is still being is being\nin the factory it contains certain chemicals\n\n\nWhich is on the surface of the of the figurines\n\n\nNow if you if you paint this figure without removing all these\nchemicals you will notice that about a few months down the road the figures\nwill start to erode the paint will start to fall off and of course nobody\nwould want that\n\n\nSo the very first thing you need to do is to wash them thoroughly\nand then thorough and then dry them thoroughly with a dry cloth\n\n\nYou may need to use the hot air blower to dry them up if you need\n\n\nOkay once the pieces are been cut and washed and dried now we\nconnect them together\n\n\nFor this process you will need the super glue\n\n\nLet me show you by connecting this hand to the body\n\n\nPut the super glue at the right places\n\n\nNow we attach the hand snugly together and hold it there for five\nseconds\n\n\nGood now it's all done but if you look at the hands and the body\nbetween the two areas where they are connected you realised that hey there\nare places that show that it is a model-kit because there are holes there are\ncertain crevices that are not been filled up nicely\n\n\nThis is unavoidable\n\n\nNow to remove these holes and crevices what we do now is to use\nthe putty\n\n\nLet me show you\n\n\nThis putty looks like a plasticine and it can be molded\n\n\nWe take a sharp object like a toothpick now take an amount of\nputty that is needed\n\n\nPut it into the hole like this\n\n\nTry to squash the putty around the edges until it's very nice\n\n\nGood now we use a cotton bud\n\n\nDip it into water and now I put the cotton bud against the area\nthat need to be smoothen out because you notice the putty spreads out\neverywhere and it's not smooth\n\n\nNow you keep putting the cotton bud around the area and smooth out\nall the whole area\n\n\nLet it dry for a few minutes and now if you take a look at it you\ndon't see the crevices anymore and it looks as if the model actually came\nwith the hand and the body connected\n\n\nIsn't it good\n\n\nNow I'm not going to show you how to do the rest but I have now an\nassembled Dr Death which I assembled earlier\n\n\nThis model now if you look at it has been fully assembled fully\nputtied everything is smooth\n\n\nRight now you think starts the painting process\n\n\nNot yet\n\n\nThe very first thing we need to do now is to first of all\nspray-paint the whole model-kit with a first coat\n\n\nNow very important this first coat must be of a neutral colour so\nI suggest you either use white or grey because these colours are not dark\nenough to be evident at the end of the painting process\n\n\nSo let me spray-paint it using the grey colour\n\n\nThis spray-paint you can get it anywhere in any shops uhm\ndepartment stores for about nine or eight dollars per can but use sparingly\n\n\nLet me demonstrate how do I actually spray-paint this figure\n\n\nYou will notice that I do not put the nozzle very very close to\nthe figure to be painted\n\n\nI usually put about one and a half feet away from the figure and I\nspray-paint it very evenly and very thinly across the whole figure\n\n\nBy putting it very closely you're your spray-paint will be too\nthick on the figure and what this would do is that it would remove all the\nintricacies and all the nooks and crevices on the figures \n\n\nAnd all the surface parts will be all gone will be all covered by\nthis thick paint\n\n\nAnd we do not want that because we still want all these surfaces\nto be there after the first coat\n\n\nIt's very important and this is how you do it\n\n\nSo just a very thin layer would do", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "67d0d7b8-0eac-4619-a9d7-72f057b0befe",

{"text": "<$A> \n\nLet me open up an application and I'll explain parts of a\nwindow\n\n\nWe've got a bit more hands-on later on\n\n\nYour note pad is a windows application\n\n\nThere's accessory in-built in your Windows three one\n\n\nOkay let me go back to your page ten notes mouse pointer\n\n\nOkay what do you see\n\n\nThis is your mouse pointer\n\n\nThat is mouse pointer\n\n\nBut when you move your mouse pointer into the note pad window it\nchanges into a what you call a pin\n\n\nThat's when you click to change your insertion point from one\nlocation to another\n\n\nThat's your insertion point\n\n\nThe insertion point is the point that which whatever you type in\nyour keyboard it will be reflected there okay\n\n\nSo if you go use your mouse pointer to click anywhere that you want\nyour your uh insertion point to go\n\n\nOkay let's go to another one control menu box\n\n\nYou see on the top left-hand corner of your note pad window this is\nyour control menu box\n\n\nWhen you click once on it it display the menu\n\n\nMove size minimise maximise close switch tools\n\n\nAll these commands you could make do without using them here\n\n\nYou could make use of these commands by using the mouse and doing\nit with the mouse rather than selecting the commands from your control menu\nbox\n\n\nThe only time when you think you need to use the control menu box\nis when you want to exit from the application\n\n\nOkay later I'll teach you how to exit from note pad One of the\nfastest ways it to double click on the control menu box\n\n\nThat's when you exit note pad okay\n\n\nThis is your control menu box\n\n\nI'll teach you how to move size minimise maximise the window later\non\n\n\nLet's go to the third one title bar window title\n\n\nThis is your title bar okay the one that is labelled in blue colour\n\n\nThe active one is always in blue\n\n\nProgramme manager is now running at the background\n\n\nProgramme manager here this is the title bar for programme manager\n\n\nThis is the title bar for note pad\n\n\nWhich ever one is whichever is the one that's active in the\nforeground will be labelled blue\n\n\nThe other one will be transparent\n\n\nBut it's up to you to define your colour that you want at desktop\nit's up to you\n\n\nBut default it's blue\n\n\nOkay this is your title this is your title bar with your window\ntitle\n\n\nSo notepad defines this window as an application window for notepad\nokay\n\n\nMenu bar this is your menu bar\n\n\nYou see file exit search help\n\n\nThis is common uhm uhm the best part of all the commands are common\nbetween Windows applications\n\n\nYou don't find just menu bar in the non Windows application\n\n\nOkay you could only find this in any Windows application\n\n\nWhat happens is you could click on any of the words any part of\nthose words there to draw down the menu\n\n\nFor file you have one menu\n\n\nEdit you have another to uh draw down menu for search another one\nand so on and so forth\n\n\nOkay this is your menu bar with your uh menu commands\n\n\nWhat you do is you click on any of the words there to drag down the\nmenu bar click on anyone of them to select the commands\n\n\nOkay let's go to next page eleven scroll bars\n\n\nCan you here this is your scroll bar\n\n\nThis is your scroll bar\n\n\nWhat happen is sometimes your document is so long the window cannot\ntake the whole data\n\n\nI mean it's it's thing WordPerfect whatever\n\n\nSo what happen is that you click on the up and down arrow to scroll\nhope you can see here\n\n\nThen you click here then you go up and down the the page\n\n\nOr you could click anywhere here\n\n\nOkay to move down up and down\n\n\nThis is your scroll bar and you got a up and down scroll bar and a\nleft and right scroll bar\n\n\nThis is your left and right scroll bar\n\n\nSame light one to scroll left and right this one is to scroll up\nand down\n\n\nOkay maximise and minimise button\n\n\nYou remember at the control menu box you have to maximise and\nminimise\n\n\nYou don't have to use your commands here\n\n\nYou can use the two small little function uh I mean boxes here\nwhich you could do\n\n\nThe up arrow is the maximise arrow maximise uh uh what you call the\nmaximise icon\n\n\nThis one is the small one the minimise function\n\n\nSo if you click on the out arrow notepad takes over the full screen\nand you would no longer will see programme manager\n\n\nOkay it's something like running a Dos application in full screen\n\n\nAnd when you click on the maximise one it should go to the install\nbutton\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you see\n\n\nSee that one\n\n\nThe maximise the maximise button is coverted into a restore button\nright so when you click on that it restores you back to the size that you\nhave had before you put in your maximise button\n\n\nOkay and this downward arrow is the minimise button\n\n\nYou click on that notepad is minimised as application icon but\nwhere is the icon\n\n\nThe icon is somewhere here\n\n\nOkay that's the notepad on the desktop\n\n\nThis is your notepad running as a minimised application icon double\nclick on that to get back in notepad\n\n\nOkay whatever size it was before you analysed it\n\n\nYou have any question so far\n\n\nOkay I can go on eh\n\n\nWindow border\n\n\nThis is your window border\n\n\nThe double line window border and when you push your mouse pointer\nto anywhere along the border your mouse pointer is changed to a double header\narrow\n\n\nThat is when you could resize your window\n\n\nSo if you drag and release drag and release this would have been\nresized\n\n\nIf you drag and release at the corner you're resizing from both\nsides\n\n\nOkay if you're doing for one side you're resizing it from one side\nonly\n\n\nThat's when you need to to resize it yourself\n\n\nOkay that's why the scroll bar is is there to to to uh let you see\nthe whichever path you <unclear> word </unclear> after the resizing <unclear>\nword </unclear>\n\n\nOkay window corner window border we've touched that\n\n\nSelection cursor insertion point this one I have explained before\n\n\nOkay this is the point where once you see that blinking there\nwhatever you type whatever you put in on the keyboard it would be reflected\nthere\n\n\nOkay that's page eleven\n\n\nAny question on the terminology for Windows parts of the Window\n\n\nChapter three we have lots of hands-on so uh once we go to chapter\nthree we have a few exercises to do\n\n\nChapter three is a very very important chapter\n\n\nOnce you get a hang of chapter three uh you know what Windows is\nall about\n\n\nOkay let's go to chapter three\n\n\nUhm page thirteen you don't get to see all these things because\nyou're in a different environment\n\n\nOkay Programme manager is central to the operation of Windows\n\n\nIt starts automatically whenever you start Windows\n\n\nIt continues to run as long as you're using Windows\n\n\nSo Programme Manager is the one that I've that I've always stress\nupon\n\n\nProgramme Manager\n\n\nOkay the Programme Manager that you see on your environment is a\nfull screen Programme Manager\n\n\nSo you never ever get to see the green desktop actually\n\n\nOkay later I'll demonstrate\n\n\nIf you resize your Programme Manager you should be able to see\nparts of the three desktop here\n\n\nWhen we push it to full screen because we need as much space as\npossible for all the applications\n\n\nOkay uhm let's skip the two lines there let's go down to the last\nparagraph\n\n\nNotice there are technical group icons at the bottom of your\nProgramme Manager\n\n\nYou've got accessories group A group servor <unclear> word\n</unclear> and group applications group\n\n\nAll this you can't see it here because we are having the NUSNET\nenvironment\n\n\nOkay it's not important let's go to page fourteen\n\n\nMore definitions\n\n\nOkay let's go to page fourteen and uh once again I want to explain\nsomething on the screen\n\n\nGroup Windows\n\n\nOkay group windows\n\n\nGroup windows programme item icons\n\n\nAll these things are called group icons\n\n\nWhat do you mean by group\n\n\nGroup in the sense that uhm they collect more things\n\n\nThey are not application icons in the sense that when you double\nclick on this it doesn't run anything for you\n\n\nWhat it does is that it opens up another windows with more icons\nthis side\n\n\nSo it's called a group icon\n\n\nAnd with <unclear> word </unclear> this icon opens up to a group\nwindow\n\n\nFor example word-processing this is your group window for\nword-processing\n\n\nSo you double click on this control menu box\n\n\nIt shrink back to a group icon or you double click on languages\ncompilers\n\n\nIt opens up to a languages compilers group window showing you more\nicon inside\n\n\nOkay what happen is inside the word-processing uh group window you\nhave more icons inside and these icons are application icons in the sense\nthat when you double click on them it does something for you\n\n\nIt runs the application already\n\n\nSo when you double click on WordPerfect it runs WordPerfect for\nyou\n\n\nYou double click on MicroSoft Word five point five it runs that\napplication for as opposed to these icons here which when you double click it\nshows you more icons that's all\n\n\nOkay so these are programme item icons these are group icons and\nthis one is a group window\n\n\nGet it this terminologies once you are used to them you don't have\nto bother about them which is it's just very natural okay\n\n\nAnd Windows three point one has its limitation in the sense it can\ntake only up to two levels which means that programme manager is the group's\nlevel and this is group level one\n\n\nGroup level one opens up to group level two\n\n\nAnd by the time you come to group level two you can't have a group\nicon inside here already\n\n\nMaybe you can but uh what happens is that there is a limit\n\n\nThere is no such thing as putting a group icon into this another\none opens up to another group icon this icon opens up to another window\n\n\nOkay there comes to a time when you have to dump in programme item\nicons in that window\n\n\nYou can't go on anymore\n\n\nThat's the limitation and that's why we have so many icons here so\nmany windows because NUSNET has so many applications\n\n\nAnd Windows three point one up to uh only gives you up to only two\nlevels in the hierachy\n\n\nSo what happens is that you've got uhm a very uhm more than\ncomplicated kind of <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nOkay I've touched on page fourteen\n\n\nAny problem on page fourteen\n\n\nGroup windows group icons programme item icons\n\n\nOkay what happens is programme item icons just band in one\nprogramme item icons are active icons\n\n\nIf you double click on them it it will run something for you\naccording to the definition you attach to that icon\n\n\nOkay group icon and group windows are just uh what group windows\nare just window <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nIt's just a window <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nIt gives you more icons\n\n\nInside your group icons where you have shrunk to this Okay\n\n\nI I'm not gonna touch accesories group games group and application\ngroup because our NUSNET environment doesn't <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nWhat I what I can point out is accesories group accesories group\nwhich you have it on here\n\n\nOkay in accesories group you have write paintbrush terminal\nnotepad reporter and so on\n\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> explain briefly what are the functions\nof each one\n\n\nWrite is actually a very primitive word-processing application\n\n\nPaintbrush is also very primitive graphics application\n\n\nTerminal is for you when you want to uh put in a a modem or\nwhatever when you want to dial up to NUSNET from from your place at home you\nhave to double click on terminal and <unclear> word </unclear> by <unclear>\nword </unclear> and so on and so forth \n\n\nNotepad as I have demonstrated just now is also a primitive\nword-processor Normally we use it for text editing Recorder is a macro\nrecorder in the sense that it could uhm uhm record uhm all your actions for\nyou and you save it in with one with one one key uhm what you call it a a\ncombination key key notes you call it So when once you just or put in the key\nnotes you could run the whole series of uhm run functions That's what a\nrecorder is Hard-file is your hard-file Calender is your calender Calcu is\nthe calculator Clock clock tells you the time that is based on instant time\non your on your machine I could change between digital and analog one Object\npackager later I'll explain O L E Character map media player sound recording\nand voice Sound record you need an extra sound card Character map is for you\nto install extra characters like uh Greek or whatever character Okay I'm not\ngoing to touch on that Maybe now I should explain something on uh O L E I\ndidn't touch on O L E Could I have the lights on Thank you very much", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "67954b24-7b4f-4c84-99de-4f136a24aa56", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.679682+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nYou know why\n\n\nBecause let's say okay in in any any kind of music most music form\nis when you write is in eight counts\n\n\nOne two three four five six seven eight\n\n\nLet's say uh how many of you take music\n\n\nHow many of you take music\n\n\nGreat all basically lost\n\n\nOkay some you know what accents are right\n\n\nFor example let's say number one number five number one number five\nyou have accents\n\n\nPump two three four pump two three four\n\n\nSo from these accents if you put it in images it means something\nbig\n\n\nOne two three four\n\n\nOne two three four\n\n\nOne two\n\n\nThat's an accent okay\n\n\nThat's why I said it's much easier to do an improvisation\n\n\nIf you know the music stand you know how the music is changed\n\n\nBut then again it loses the whole improv you know because once you\nstart choreographing that means you start planning it loses it's <unclear>\nword </unclear> because it comes from here it doesn't come from here\n\n\nOkay in order for you to get involve you have to be totally totally\ntotally commit yourself to the music like what I did just now\n\n\nOnce in a while I could get you all and say move this move this\nmove this no\n\n\nRather than that you know you look at me just now I went completely\nblank look blur look zero\n\n\nPay attention girls you all going to start and then zero yourself\nin this way okay\n\n\nAny question so far\n\n\nAny questions so far\n\n\nMost of the music I've chosen today are those that you can feel\nquite easily which you can characterise quite easily okay\n\n\nUh I will do my last uhm imitation exercises okay\n\n\nFor this time I just want volunteers uhm we're running short of\ntime and I rather spend more time with you all than me me showing you\n\n\nI want I want uhm three from a group volunteers three from a group\nVolunteers three from a group anybody anybody\n\n\nIf you all don't volunteer I volunteer for you\n\n\nOkay come\n\n\nRight\n\n\nDon't move don't move four guys there\n\n\nAny of you from my school\n\n\nR I\n\n\nI pick uh one two three\n\n\nUhm one two three\n\n\nUh one two three Okay\n\n\nUh the rest of you sit back sit back\n\n\nSpread out\n\n\nSpread out\n\n\nSpread out\n\n\nOkay how many of you know Kitaro\n\n\nHow many of you know Kitaro Okay he's he's a Japanese composer\n\n\nDon't\n\n\nNext time everyone of you please pay attention\n\n\nHe's a Japanese composer specialising in Asian works or making use\nof Western music\n\n\nBut sometimes he's ethnic Japanese instruments okay\n\n\nUhm he's one of those composers or or artistes who lead you into\nconfusion <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nOkay and his next piece from this one is from from the album called\nKojiki\n\n\nIs a whole dance drama\n\n\nOne whole album of this drama and this part is quite grand\n\n\nThat's why you have to be very very fast\n\n\nI think you can't see right now\n\n\nI think I tell you what can you just split so they come over here\n\n\nSplit split split split split\n\n\nSit at the sit at the side can you come\n\n\nThe rest just stand behind lah or sit behind or sit at the side\n\n\nYah\n\n\nOkay my first imitation\n\n\nJust now was very easy\n\n\nThen you get into the a little bit more difficult\n\n\nThis one is a little bit advance but uhm bear with me\n\n\nReady\n\n\nReady\n\n\nReady\n\n\nMusic loud\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay some part of the music is very heavily accented\n\n\nSome parts are quite <unclear> word </unclear> which means ching\n\n\nIt's kind of lazy you know flowy and uhm uhm if you have to put it\ninto visuals the accents are like pup pup like that and this movement is more\nsphere you know\n\n\nIt's more like a crown\n\n\nOkay there are straight movements\n\n\nThere are some back front\n\n\nAll these you can use\n\n\nAny question\n\n\nAny question\n\n\nOkay I tell you what\n\n\nFind the space anywhere that you can find anywhere anywhere that is\ncomfortable for you\n\n\nNo need no need to face mirror\n\n\nJust face anywhere\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nSome of you can come over here\n\n\nOkay uhm too crowded over there\n\n\nSpread out\n\n\nSpread out\n\n\nSome of you can go over there\n\n\nDon't be shy\n\n\nI won't eat you all\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nUhm okay\n\n\nWhat I want you to do right now I'm gonna play the Japanese piece\nagain and I just want you all to move\n\n\nYa but don't move out your sphere and go knock into each other\n\n\nStay as I did\n\n\nYou do a stationary improvisation\n\n\nNo you can stand you can sit you can jump but stay in your own\nsphere\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nPay attention\n\n\nI want you to just move on your body\n\n\nI'm not\n\n\nNobody's gonna gonna <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nAny question\n\n\nThis is not a test\n\n\nThis is a chance for you to just let go\n\n\nI'm not here to judge\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nOkay you can <unclear> word </unclear> off anything <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n\nReady\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nUh one rule which I don't want which I want everybody to follow\n\n\nDo not look into the mirror\n\n\nDon't look at mirror\n\n\nYou can face anyone else and if you find that halfway through like\nsometimes I do improvise\n\n\nSometimes I find that I cannot move because I'm too conscious I'm\ntoo frightened\n\n\nLet's say you put like uhm you know people like people I don't\nknow I don't like for example then I like I must impress I must impress I\nmust impress\n\n\nI cannot do it\n\n\nCause once you have that that kind of attitude that kind of\ncompetitiveness you find you're very <unclear> word </unclear> and slow\n\n\nOkay what I normally just close my eyes and pretend they're not\nthere\n\n\nPretend that's my mother my father my brother and my sister\n\n\nPeople\n\n\nYou're people you're comfortable with\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nLet's try\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was fun\n\n\nSome of I I notice some of you have got some little difficulty\nbecause uh how come\n\n\nShare share share\n\n\n\n\n\nWell not really once you start uhm trying rationalise your action\nyou cannot do it\n\n\nWorse still if it's right in front under the light so you know you\ntend to you tend to <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nOkay but I see some good stuff from some of you okay\n\n\nUh bear in mind like I said before there's no such thing as right\nor wrong improvisation\n\n\nWhat you did was as long as you feel honest about it as long as\nyou feel good about it's okay\n\n\nBut there is a difference between a poor improvisation and a rich\nimprovisation\n\n\nI mean what is the bad sense\n\n\nWhich means like uh the music has got different different types of\n<unclear> word </unclear> accents slurs staccatos staccatos and all this\nthings\n\n\nUhm these are all I mean in in you all know music these are all\nadded in to bring some kind of character to the music\n\n\nSo accordingly when you do your movements you have to <unclear>\nword </unclear> character to the music\n\n\nYou know for example uh let's say for example if the music goes pa\npa tak tak pa pa pa da dem\n\n\nPa pa tak tak pa pa pa da dem okay\n\n\nThen if you do pa pa tak tak pa pa tak tak pa pa you're not you're\nnot you're not making use you're not swiping <unclear> word </unclear> up\nyour teeth all these little little <unclear> word </unclear> suppose to be\nthere\n\n\nYou get what I mean\n\n\nOkay how do you get rid of that\n\n\nOne thing you have to know about it\n\n\nYou all did this\n\n\nYou all did this\n\n\nYou all did this\n\n\nYou did this which you want to you know\n\n\nYou need to notice the ball <unclear> word </unclear> expression\nalso\n\n\nHe did this just now you know\n\n\nThere's so many your body can do so many things okay\n\n\nThat's why one thing that I when I work with uh a lot of people\nthey think their most visible part the part that's most outstanding usually\nthe arms so pam pam zek zek pam pam and they end up doing this\n\n\nUse your other parts your head your leg your eveything\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nNow okay\n\n\nIt's let's as I said again it's important for you to try out\nbecause this is a practical session\n\n\nIt's also important for you to observe right\n\n\nI want you to observe other people look straight uh also eye level\n\n\nWhen I see for example during the <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nI done it actually move this way okay\n\n\nMove this way\n\n\nThat's how that's how he communicate to me\n\n\nThat's how I create <unclear> word </unclear> and communicate with\nyou all\n\n\nThat's what that's what this session is all about\n\n\nIt's not how pretty your movements it's not about how complex it\nis\n\n\nIt's not whether I can do a split not whether I can I can kick and\nput my legs up here\n\n\nI mean it's not I can't do that\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nThe basis for dance is essentially what the main question is\n\n\nBeing and <unclear> word </unclear> same thing like writing like\ndrama like music\n\n\nOkay as long as if I do it and you feel touched more happy\n\n\nIf you do it I feel touched you know I'm I'm it's okay with me I'm\nI'm glad at least there's some kind of interaction and <unclear> word\n</unclear> action\n\n\nSo okay let's start with group three and group one and group two I\nwant to sit back and feel free to start this\n\n\nDo the same thing Okay I play the same music so that if you've got\nmore <unclear> word </unclear> in what\n\n\nOkay whose part is this\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nThank you\n\n\nSee the more you do the more conscious you become\n\n\nThat's good and bad for one thing\n\n\nUh good in the sense that uhm you become more aware of what your\nbody can do\n\n\nThat's why I prefer to be less <unclear> word </unclear> so that\nat least I need someone to stay there because I've said I shoulders shoulders\nlegs legs use your weight that kind of thing which is actually quite\ndistracting\n\n\nYou are not you're not able to fully appreciate that freedom of\nmovement\n\n\nBut I need to do that because or else your your movement will tend\nto be rather restricted okay\n\n\nUnderstand but I think some of the boys were dying to use rhythm\nrhythm\n\n\nWe'll use the same music again\n\n\n\n\n\nUh many of them got stuck although there is although they may seem\notherwise because you're looking at the mirror\n\n\nClose your\n\n\nClose\n\n\nClose\n\n\nI think we switch on this and switch off that\n\n\nYa okay\n\n\nWho's uh standing down there just now\n\n\nSee uhm what was he you see just now there's a lot we all were uhm\nI felt you were using something that I mean I wouldn't do like uh P J and\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nI call it P J okay\n\n\nI call you P J for short\n\n\nUhm he uses a lot fingers you know\n\n\nDid you take Chinese dance\n\n\nDo you take Chinese dance\n\n\nHe moves like the monkey god do that\n\n\nUhm good you see you can help you you it it will help you a lot\nfor example\n\n\nDo you have anykind of a a a impression before you hear the music\n\n\nBecause sometimes it can help if let's say you don't just listen\nto the music and you just listen to music and do it\n\n\nIt helps sometimes if you listen to the music and you form a\npicture you speak into the picture\n\n\nIt's much easier that's what you did right\n\n\nYa because you can actually tell a story from there you know\n<unclear> word </unclear> go go into the jungle for example then you can see\na <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nSee you can do all sorts of things with this\n\n\nYou can actually form a story and that's where your ensemble\nshould come later\n\n\nNow that's reasonable\n\n\nAnything\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nBefore I stop this time\n\n\nUh can how did you all feel for example \n\n\nWhat Uhm that's the way they treat it after three weeks they feel\nso relieved", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "db8b2e48-0f7f-4962-91b0-fc76e1fb8a88", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nMay it please you my Lords\n\n\nAs far as possible my Lords I'll try to deal with the arguments of\nmy learned friend in the order that he has presented them but where necessary\nI will have to transpose certain parts of my skeletal arguments\n\n\nMy Lord the first argument of my learned friend was that the learned\njudge had considered the wrong issues\n\n\nOn this point of course I beg to differ\n\n\nThe learned judge had stated that there were two issues as it were\none whether the Appellants were aware of the forty-five per cent rule before\nthe Respondents placed their order for the T V sets\n\n\nThen as a corollary to this he said whether the issue of the\nSingapore certificates of origin connoted compliance with the forty-five per\ncent rule\n\n\nAnd then the second issue he said was whether P W three had\ndiscussed the forty-five per cent rule with D W one\n\n\nThese issues were read to your Lordship earlier and appear at the\nRecord of Appeal page three hundred and twenty-five paragraph E and continues\nright through to page three hundred and twenty-six paragraphs A B and C\n\n\nNow my learned friend has pointed out that the issues as stated by\nthe learned judge here differ from what was presented in my opening The\nposition is that it was never pleaded in the amended defence that the\nDefendants or the Appellants were unaware of the forty-five per cent rule\n\n\nThe amended defence appears on the Record of Appeal at pages ten to\neleven\n\n\nThere is merely denial and put to strict proof but there was no\nallegation that the Defendants were not aware of the forty-five per cent rule\n\n\nAs my Lords would be aware it's rather difficult at the opening\nspeech to contemplate all the issues that will arise in the course of the\nevidence given particularly when the same is not obvious from the pleadings\nthemselves\n\n\nIn the statement of claim at page seven of the Record of Appeal my\nLord paragraph four I'd pleaded that it was an express term of the contract\nthat the T V sets supplied would be issued with certificates of Singapore\norigin\n\n\nI went on to plead the Plaintiffs content that in order for the T V\nsets to be issued with certificates of Singapore origin\n\n\nThe Plaintiffs say that the defence well knew the purpose of their\nrequirement of the certificates of origin was to ensure that this forty-five\nper cent requirement existed\n\n\nTo my mind what this implies or what this connotes is that the\nPlaintiffs wanted to ensure that this forty-five per cent rule would be\ncomplied with and that is why they had requested for the Singapore\ncertificates of origin\n\n\nNow in the course of evidence as developed at the trial the\nAppellant's witnesses had repeatedly said that they had no knowledge\nwhatsoever of the forty-five per cent rule\n\n\nSo it became an underlying issue whether the Appellants were aware\nof this forty-five per cent rule\n\n\nIn my statement of claim at this paragraph four Record of Appeal\npage seven I mentioned very clearly the Plaintiffs say the Defence well knew\nthe purpose of the requirement of the C O was to ensure that forty-five per\ncent requirement existed\n\n\nSo knowledge is then an issue because the Defendants had denied\nthis aspect\n\n\nMy case was that the Appellants knew of this forty-five per cent\nrule and it was to ensure its compliance that the Singapore certificate was\nasked for and required but the Appellants maintained that they were not aware\n\n\nSo the issue of knowledge of the Appellants then was very material\nin this case and it was a crux issue that surfaced throughout the course of\nthe trial\n\n\nOf course the other ancillary issues like whether it was to ensure\ncompliance that the Respondents had contracted for the Singapore certificate\nof origin\n\n\nWhether it was an express term of the contract that this forty-five\nper cent rule were complied with\n\n\nWhether it was an implied term that there should be compliance with\nthis forty-five per cent rule\n\n\nWould all of whether the Appellants were aware of this forty-five\nper cent rule before the Respondents placed their order\n\n\nNow in this regard the discussions which P W three had with D W one\nthe first witness for the Appellants in the course of the trial which the\nparties had before the order was placed would be very important\n\n\nNow as my learned friend had accepted in his submissions to my\nLords he accepts that there was evidence in conflict here between the parties\nin regard to the discussions\n\n\nNow P W three's evidence of the discussions was that he had\ndefinitely asked the Respondent's D W one whether he would the Singapore\ncompany that's the Appellants would definitely be able to comply with the\ncriteria for origin requirements\n\n\nThey said they were fully aware of this\n\n\nThis is at the Record of Appeal the evidence appears at Record of\nAppeal thirty-eight B to D\n\n\nThey said they were fully aware of this and to give him further\nconfirmation\n\n\nD W one further supported by saying that they had had their own\nplant manufacturing T V tubes in Singapore\n\n\nHe assured that in addition he is planning to send a set of\nmoldings to inject plastic cabinets to increase the Singapore content\n\n\nAnd in further cross-examination of P W three at Record of Appeal\nforty-two D he said P W three gave evidence the forty-five per cent content\nrule was discussed between the parties\n\n\nAt Record of Appeal forty-three the P W three insisted that he had\nspecifically discussed the forty-five per cent rule with the Appellants\n\n\nIn page after page of the evidence of P W three we see that P W\nthree insisted that the forty-five per cent contact rule had been discussed\nbetween the parties \n\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE : Where is this please Page \n\n<$A> \n\nYour honour if I could refer you to my skeletal arguments at\npage three under the subheading evidence one\n\n\nI have made a notation of all the relevant pages and the paragraphs\ninvolved \n\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE: Ah yes \n\n\nNow at the Record of Appeal page forty-three paragraph C it was put\nto him you did not inform the Defendants of the forty-five per cent local\ncontent rule and the answer I deny that\n\n\nThey know about it\n\n\nWe had specifically discussed it prior to the issue of letter of\ncredit\n\n\nWe also discussed plastic toolings for plastic cabinets to be\ntransferred to Singapore so that the Singapore content could be increased to\nmeet the Singapore requirement\n\n\nThis was an important feature for Singapore goods to be imported\ninto England\n\n\nGoods must be manufactured in Singapore and also the forty-five per\ncent local content rule must be complied with\n\n\nAnd then at page forty-four of the Record of Appeal paragraphs E to\nF there's mention the forty-five per cent content rule was orally discussed\nbetween me and the Taiwan company\n\n\nTowards the last paragraph put you did not mention the forty-five\nper cent content rule and the answers I did inform them\n\n\nIn fact we discussed the matter\n\n\nAt page forty-five of the Record of Appeal paragraph C there it's\nput just before the re-examination it's put at all material times neither you\nnor the Defendants knew of the 45 forty-five per cent rule and P W three\ntestifies\n\n\nWe both knew of this rule because it was an understanding that they\nuse local materials and further increase the Singapore content\n\n\nThe plastic moldings would be transferred to Singapore\n\n\nThey have made these arrangements\n\n\nNow D W one's evidence on these discussions were different and were\nin conflict with P W three's\n\n\nThe evidence of D W one appears at page forty-nine of the Record of\nAppeal forty-nine right at the top your Honour\n\n\nIt said D W one said I only told Mr Pandia that we were able to\nobtain the certificate of origin\n\n\nI did not mention to him about the criteria requirement as I was\nnot aware of that at that time\n\n\nI am not aware of the percentage cost of the moldings in so far as\nthe total cost is concerned\n\n\nIt also appears at fifty-two paragraphs C to E\n\n\nThis is D W one's evidence on discussions between the parties\n\n\nAt paragraph C do you recall receiving a telephone call from Mister\nPandia late September in nineteen seventy-eight or early October\nseventy-eight and the answer comes there were many telephone calls I can't\nremember when they were made\n\n\nHe asked me if I could obtain a certificate of origin for the T V\nsets manufactured in Singapore\n\n\nI told him that Singapore was making picture tubes\n\n\nI also told him that we were going to send to Singapore some\nmoldings to make cabinets for T V sets\n\n\nOnly with picture tube and cabinets the content might not be\nforty-five per cent\n\n\nAdministrative and labour charges would cost fifteen per cent and\nthe material cost would cost eight-five per cent\n\n\nThen at page fifty-four paragraph E D W one testified\n\n\nIn the course of our conversation I told him that our Singapore\ncompany manufactured picture tubes in Singapore\n\n\nI told him that the T V sets from Singapore would have picture\ntubes made in Singapore\n\n\nI also told him that cabinets for the T V sets would also be made\nin Singapore\n\n\nI told him that I would be sending the moldings to Singapore to\nmeet Plaintiff's requirement in regard to the casings\n\n\nMy Lord in the light of the different versions of the discussions\nmy submission is that the learned judge had to assess the truth of the two\nwitnesses here in the light of their conflicting evidence\n\n\nMy Lord it is my submission that in regard to the discussion the\njudgment of the learned judge comprises findings of fact based on the\ncredibility or reliability of the witnesses rather than inferences drawn from\nspecific facts\n\n\nNow on this matter I would refer your Honour to the judgment which\nis at that part of report of the judgment at Record of Appeal three hundred\nand thirty-one page three hundred and thirty-one\n\n\nIt's at paragraph E under the title issue B\n\n\nIssue B has been defined by his Lordship at Record of Appeal three\nhundred and twenty-six to mean whether did P W three and D W one discuss the\nforty-five per cent rule before the order was placed\n\n\nNow here the judgment reads on this issue the evidence of Pandia P\nW three reads as follows\n\n\nThen there is then set out the evidence of P W three which is at\nthe Record of Appeal page thirty-eight B to D and which I had referred your\nHonour to\n\n\nOver the page at page 332 of the Record of Appeal the judgment goes\non on this aspect of Pandia's evidence Lyn's reads then follows a note of \n\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE: Just one moment Which part of three hundred and\nthirty-two are you reading from \n\n\nI am at para C \n\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE : I see \n\n\nOn this aspect of Pandia's evidence \n\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE : Oh yes \n\n\nLyn D W one's evidence reads and then there's a quotation of Lyn's\nevidence\n\n\nAnd after the quotation the learned judge then says at paragraph G\nof that page my Lord on this aspect of the case on a balance of probabilities\n\n\nI accept the evidence of Pandia that he had discussed with Lyn the\nreasons for and implications for providing the T V sets with the Singapore\ncertificate of origin\n\n\nYour Honour there can be no clearer case to my mind that the\nlearned judge was here weighing the probability of the two versions of\nevidence that was given and he had preferred the evidence of P W three in\nfavour of D W one\n\n\nMy Lord now in regard to this portion of the argument my learned\nfriend had cited the cases of Ben Max versus Austin Motor and Ward versus\nThomas\n\n\nI don't propose to turn up the pages because the two cases decided\nwas that there is a distinction between findings of fact based on credibility\nof witnesses and a finding of fact based on inferences from specific facts\nthat is a difference between perception of facts from evaluation of facts", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL",

{"text": "<$A> \n\nYour Honour the findings the appeal that's before your Honour\nhere is essentially an appeal on the finding of fact made by the learned\ntrial judge after hearing witnesses\n\n\nYour Honour I wish to take your Honour very quickly to the\nprinciples on which an appellate court acts in reviewing a finding of fact\nand your Honour these cases are referred to in my skeletal arguments\n\n\nThe first I would refer your Honour to is a case of Colonial\nSecurities Trust Company Limited versus Massey and Others\n\n\nThat appears your Honour at my bundle of authorities filed in\nrespect of Civil Appeal Number one hundred and sixteen of eighty-seven that's\nthe first case at page one\n\n\nI refer your Honour to the headnotes\n\n\nIt says that where a case tried by a judge without a jury comes\nbefore the court of appeal that court will presume that the decision of the\njudge on the facts was right and will not disturb it unless the Appellant\nsatisfactorily makes out that it was wrong\n\n\nYour Honour in this very short headnote your Honour there is your\nHonour will notice a presumption that the decision of a judge on a finding of\nfacts was correct and secondly your Honour that there is always this onus\nthrust upon the Appellant to show that he was wrong\n\n\nYour Honour having said that I refer your Honour to the second case\nand that's at page two of my skeletal arguments\n\n\nIt's found at page five of the bundle of authorities\n\n\nThat's the decision of Montgomery and Company Limited versus\nWallace James\n\n\nYour Honour the facts basically in the Montgomery case was an\naction by the plaintiff respondent in which she raised an action for\ninterdict\n\n\nI believe that is the action more or less akin to an action for an\ninjunction against the defendant appellants and other persons encroaching on\na strip of ground consisting of a few yards in length and breadth situated on\na edge of the river on\n\n\nThe plea that this ground in question had from time immemorial been\ndedicated to the use of herself and the inhabitants for the purpose of\nrecreation and amusement and the bleaching and dry of clothes\n\n\nSo it essentially your Honour was the issue in question was whether\nthere was this user and whether it was established\n\n\nIf it was she would have succeeded\n\n\nYour Honour the House of Lords in this case held and found as a\nfact that this ground had from time immemorial been and had not been\ndedicated for the use as here described\n\n\nYour Honour I would refer to the decision of the Earl of Halsbury\nat page seven in which he sets out the principles which will be relevant in\nmy submissions in this case\n\n\nAt page seven the Earl of Halsbury L C said this my Lord\n\n\nI think this appeal should be allowed\n\n\nIt is simply a question of fact and doubtless where a question of\nfact has been decided by a tribunal which has seen and heard the witnesses\nthe greatest weight ought to be attached to the finding of such a tribunal\n\n\nIt has had the opportunity of observing the demeanor of the\nwitnesses and judging of their veracity and accuracy in a way that no\nappellate court can have\n\n\nBut where no question arises as to truthfulness and where the\nquestion is as to the proper inferences to be drawn from truthful evidence\nthen the original tribunal is in no better position to decide than the judges\nof an appellate court\n\n\nYour Honour stopping here the emphasis your Honour I would draw is\nthe distinction between truthfulness truthful evidence your Honour and in\nthis case though as I have said it is simply a question of fact\n\n\nI do not think it is necessary to discredit a single witness in the\nsense of imputing to him willful untruth\n\n\nThere are some differences between the two sets of witnesses though\nI think not very much on any questions which depends on the personal\nrecollection of the witnesses\n\n\nAnd three lines down your Honour he says but I give credit to the\nhonest desire of all the witnesses to give an accurate view of the fitting??\nas they themselves saw it\n\n\nSo your Honour the House of Lords in that case drew a distinction\nin an appeal\n\n\nAn appellate court is in as good a position as the trial judge if\nthere is no question of untruthful evidence where truth has been established\n\n\nAnd rightly so in the facts of the Montgomery case because we have\nin that case two different sets of witnesses both trying to tell the court\nwhat they saw over a long period of time\n\n\nThere was no question of any untruthfulness they were merely\nrelating to the court what were their personal experiences what they saw over\na period of time\n\n\nUnlike your Honour in this case where both the Appellant and the\nRespondent were in control of their vehicles\n\n\nIt was the case it was either you or I who was responsible for the\naccident\n\n\nAnd your Honour it's my respectful submission your Honour that\nthere is a distinction truthful evidence is in issue in this case\n\n\nYour Honour if I may again refer your Honour to the next case and\nthat is the case of Powell and Wife versus Treakin Menon Nursing??\n\n\nNow in that case it's at page forty-four of my bundle of\nauthorities\n\n\nIt is page forty-four your Honour\n\n\nThis was a case by a husband and wife against the nursing home for\nnegligence causing injuries to the wife\n\n\nAt the first instance your Honour the trial judge held and allowed\nthe plaintiff's claim\n\n\nIn the Court of Appeal the defendants succeeded\n\n\nThe House of Lords your Honour reverse the decision of the court of\nappeal and affirmed the decision of the trial judge\n\n\nYour Honour again the observations made by that court are relevant\nto the present proceedings\n\n\nI would refer your Honour to page fifty\n\n\nAt page fifty the decision the judgment of Viscount Selkie L C\nseven lines from the bottom your Honour he says that on an appeal against a\njudgement of a judge sitting alone the court of appeal will not set aside the\njudgment unless the appellant satisfies the court that the judge was wrong\nand that his decision ought to have been the other way\n\n\nWhere there has been a conflict of evidence your Honour the court\nof appeal will have special regard to the fact that the judge saw the\nwitnesses and he refers to the case of Clark versus Edinburgh Tramways where\nit was said that when a judge hears and see witnesses and makes a conclusion\nor inference with regard to what is the weight on balance of their evidence\nthat judgment is entitled to great respect\n\n\nAnd that quite and your Honour I place emphasis on this quite\nirrespective of whether the judge makes any observation with regard to\ncredibility or not\n\n\nThere is no need your Honour for a trial judge to say I think that\nthis witness is incredible he is a liar\n\n\nThere is no need for that your Honour\n\n\nIt goes on to say I can of course quite understand a court of\nappeal that says that it will not interfere in a case in which the judge has\nannounced as part of his judgment that he believes one set of witnesses\nhaving seen and heard them and does not believe another\n\n\nBut that is not the ordinary case of a cause in a court of justice\n\n\nIn courts of justice in the ordinary case things are much more\nevenly divided\n\n\nWitnesses without any conscious bias towards the conclusion may\nhave in their demeanor in their manner in their hesitation in their nuance of\ntheir expression in even the turns of the eye-lids left an impression upon\nthe man who saw and heard them which can never be reproduced in the printed\npage\n\n\nWhat in such circumstances thus psychologically put is the duty of\nan appellate court\n\n\nIn my opinion the duty of an appellate court in those circumstances\nis for each judge of it to put to himself as I now do in this case the\nquestion am I who sit here without those advantages sometimes broad and\nsometimes subtle which are the privilege of the judge who heard and tried the\ncase in the position not having those privileges to come to a clear\nconclusion that the judge who had them was plainly wrong\n\n\nIf I cannot be satisfied in my mind that the judge with those\nprivileges was plainly wrong then it appears to me to be my duty to defer to\nhis judgment\n\n\nAgain very quickly your Honour I would also refer to page fifty-two\nyour Honour and that is somewhere in the middle third-quarter of the page\njust before the end of penultimate paragraph of his judgment\n\n\nHe said having regard to the facts it is in my view quite\nimpossible to say that the learned judge was wrong in coming to the\nconclusion he arrived at in favour of the plaintiff\n\n\nSo your Honour there is essentially a difficult task on the part of\nAppellant in a case such where a finding of fact is involved and more so in\nthe case of an accident\n\n\nYour Honour the next part of the judgment is at page fifty-six your\nHonour and that is the decision of Lord Atkin\n\n\nI shan't take your Honour longer on this case except to refer to\npage fifty-six and to say that and to refer to the decision\n\n\nI wish to express my concurrence in the view that on appeals from\nthe decision of a judge sitting without a jury the jurisdiction of the Court\nof Appeal is free and unrestricted\n\n\nThe court has to re-hear in other words has the same right to come\nto decisions on the issues of facts as well as law as the trial judge\n\n\nBut the court is still a Court of Appeal and in exercising its\nfunctions is subject to the inevitable qualifications of that position\n\n\nIt must recognise the onus upon the appellant to satisfy that the\ndecision below is wrong it must recognise the essential advantage of the\ntrial judge in seeing the witnesses and watching their demeanor\n\n\nIn cases which turn on the conflicting testimony of witnesses and\nthe belief to be reposed in them an appellate court can never recapture the\ninitial advantage of the judge who saw and believed and in no cases should\nthis advantage be more readily recognised than in cases which involve\ncharacter and reputation\n\n\nAnd your Honour the judge concluded Lord Atkin again at the bottom\nof this page he says that I have\n\n\nHas your Honour got that\n\n\nI have not tried to form any opinion as to what judgment\n\n\nI should have given if I had seen the witnesses myself\n\n\nThere is no need for your Honour to ask yourself what would I have\ndecided\n\n\nYour Honour the onus is always on the Appellant\n\n\nIf he cannot discharge the onus to show that the judge was wrong he\nfails\n\n\nYour Honour the next case which I would refer to I would skip case\nD and that's a decision of Watt versus Thomas that's been referred to by my\nlearned friend it essentially says the same thing\n\n\nBut I would refer your Honour to the last case which I have in my\nskeletal arguments and that's the decision of Benlax versus Austin Motor at\npage seventy-seven of my bundle\n\n\nYour Honour this case I believe is a case which has been relied\nupon heavily by my learned friend that the court drew a distinction between\nthe evaluation and perception of facts your Honour\n\n\nAnd the facts in this case your Honour concern the existence of an\ninventive step whether or not a certain pattern was valid\n\n\nYour Honour the relevant parts which I would quote your Honour is\nat page seventy-eight and that's the decision or Viscount Simmons \n\n\nAt the last paragraph your Honour somewhere third line from the\ntop where he says after reviewing the previous authorities he says but I\ncannot help thinking that some confusion may have arisen from failure to\ndistinguish between the finding of a specific fact and the finding of fact\nwhich is really an inference from facts specifically found\n\n\nMy learned friend has sought to argue that what the trial judge\ndid was an inference not of specific facts but merely on what he would say\ninferential findings\n\n\nBut your Honour Viscount Simmons himself drew a distinction and he\nreferred to a case concerning negligence on the part of the defendant when he\nsays that it first must be as determined whether the defendant in fact did\nand secondly whether what he did amounted in the circumstances to negligence", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "5b2291cc-2b7d-493b-a8ae-e1e6a5d70c2b", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.683286+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nMay it please the court\n\n\nYour honour since there is no dispute that the Respondent Plaintiff\nwas incapacitated between fifth March seventy-nine and fifteenth July eight\nfrom working I won't be going into the facts relating to that\n\n\nThe first issue here is whether he was entitled as of right to his\nsalaries\n\n\nPrior to the accident your honour the Respondent was both a director\nand shareholder of Seagull Marine and he was also the chairman of both\ncompanies\n\n\nBut at the same time he was also a working director of that company\nand his source of income would be salaries received as a working director\ndirector's fees and dividends\n\n\nAnd these are all shown on his income tax returns your honour from\npage one hundred and forty-five of the Record of Appeal in Civil Appeal one\nhundred and seventeen of eighty-seven\n\n\nAnd in fact there on occasions he has received dividends and\noccasions he has received directors fees\n\n\nOn page one hundred and fifty of the Record of Appeal there are\npayments also for director's fees from another company and from page one\nhundred and fifty-one there were dividends paid in respect of Pan Asia\nServices\n\n\nBut this appeal only concerns his salaries which he was drawing a\nsum of two thousand dollars from Pan Asia and five hundred dollars from\nSeagull Marine and he was earning these sums even prior to the accident\n\n\nHis income tax returns show that these were not amounts which he\njust decided after the accident to take\n\n\nAs such your Honour my submission is that he is an employee of the\ncompany both the companies\n\n\nAnd in this respect I would like to refer to the Appellant's bundle\nof authorities\n\n\nThat's the blue bundle in one hundred and sixteen of eighty-seven\n\n\nMr Benedict Chan's appeal my Lord bundle of authorities number\neighteen of the case marked number eighteen your Honour which was taken from\nPalmer's on Company Law\n\n\nAnd at the bottom it's a general statement that directors are not\nas such employees for the company or employed by the company nor are they\nservants of the company or members of the staff\n\n\nThis becomes important in three way of instances\n\n\nThen it goes on on the next page but I would like to start on the\nsecond paragraph of the next page at page eight hundred and seventy-six where\nit says a director can however pull a salary employment or an office in\naddition to that of his directorship which way for these purposes making an\nemployee or a servant\n\n\nAnd in such a case he would enjoy any rights given to the employees\nas such\n\n\nOn the facts of our case my Lord it's quite clear that he was not\njust a director but he was more than a director\n\n\nAnd there is no evidence your Honour that he was running the\ncompany improperly\n\n\nSo long as the companies have complied with the requirements of the\nCompany's Act I do not see how one can say that it is not a separate legal\nentity and that actually he was paid himself\n\n\nAnd his loss was not or rather suggested that his loss was actually\nwhat the monies which he received was actually an entitlement\n\n\nHe could be an agent on behalf of the company and at the same time\nhe could also contract himself when he becomes an employee\n\n\nAnd one other fact is that this were not companies which were\nsolely owned by him as your Honour has pointed out in Seagull Marine\n\n\nHe only owned fifty per cent his son owned fifty per cent and in\nPan Asia he owned thirty per cent of the shares the rest were owned by his\nson\n\n\nNow the court found your Honour that on the evidence presented that\nthough he continued drawing the salaries it was not paid to him as an\nentitlement though the court presumed that there was an employment since he\nwas working but there was no evidence to suggest that it was an entitlement\n\n\nAnd his reasons why he drew the salaries was that because otherwise\nhe could not survive he needed these monies\n\n\nAnd one has to apply a very practical approach to this kind of\nsituation your Honour because in Singapore especially there are very many of\nsuch companies and most people who when an incident like this occurs where\nthey are injured they don't think of the legalities involved at that point of\ntime\n\n\nThe more pressing needs are raised what do they need for their\nmedical expenses what they need for daily needs\n\n\nNot whether he is entitled to draw the salary or not they just\ncarry on\n\n\nThey only apply the legalities are only addressed when they\nsubsequently go and consult their solicitors\n\n\nAnd on that basis your Honour my submission is that it cannot be\naccepted that what he drew as salaries was because he was entitled to\n\n\nNow the points have been raised by my learned friend was that\nbecause they were family companies he was entitled to draw his salary\n\n\nMy submission on that is my Lord it should not make any difference\nwhether it was family company or companies which were not owned by him\n\n\nWhat difference is therefore in such a situation to another\nsituation where he is also a shareholder with several of his friends as\nshareholders\n\n\nAnd a similar situation arises and his other directors allow him to\ncontinue drawing the salary\n\n\nWhat are the principles should that situation be distinguished from\nthis situation or they didn't where he just said we are employee where the\nemployer says where he has been a long standing employee and he is injured\nseriously injured and incapacitated and the employer says never mind we will\npay you your salary in the meantime and if and when you get it then we decide\nwhether to repay it back\n\n\nThus I don't see why anybody should discriminate in any of these\ninstances\n\n\nAnd in fact your Honour one of the cases which was cited by the\nAppellants was the case of Esso Petroleum which is in support of the fact\nthat it is the same company and so that the plaintiff and the company are one\nand the same\n\n\nThat's in the same bundle which one of the issues here was the sum\nof six thousand two hundred and seventy pounds which was utilized by a family\ncompany by the defendant here who was counter-claiming for his loss\n\n\nAnd the arguments put forward against this claim was that it was\nnot his loss but his private family company's loss because the source of the\nfunds were from that and since the company was not claiming he should not\nsucceed\n\n\nThe court found that it was his loss but I would like to refer your\nHonour to all the judgments and the first judgment it should be on page eight\nhundred and twenty of Lord Denning\n\n\nSorry not eight hundred and twenty eight hundred and twenty-one\nyour Honour at para F in page eight hundred and twenty-one of the report\nparagraph F where Lord Denning deals with the loss\n\n\nIf I may just read the initial capital of six thousand two hundred\nand seventy pounds was not provided by Mr Mathan personally out of his bank\naccount\n\n\nIt is no concern of Esso where it came from\n\n\nYour Honour both the court seems to imply that it was his loss at\nthe same time\n\n\nThe court also seemed to imply the judge Lord Denning that he\ntreated it as if that it was the loan from his own private company to him\n\n\nAnd similarly Omrod L J at page eight hundred and thirty of the\nsame report after going into the facts that both Mister Mathan and the\ncompany never kept a proper records and if I may just come to the last line\njust after paragraph C\n\n\nIt would be for Mister Mathan and the company to arrange their own\naffairs hereafter implying that though Mister Mathan may have create treated\nthe company as his own he should put the affairs in order and I would think\nwhat he meant was that these monies should go back to the company\n\n\nSo they are actually treating these monies which Mister Mathan\nreceived as a loan\n\n\nAnd that is precisely what the learned trial judge in this case in\nour case did\n\n\nHe treated it as voluntary payments and that is supported on the\nfacts and it is a general rule your Honour that voluntary ex gratia payments\nneed not be taken into consideration when the court is assessing loss of\nearnings\n\n\nAnd I would like to refer Monkmen which is on page nine of my\nbundle for the general principles it's a white bundle of authorities\n\n\nAnd if I may just read the three situations which are relevant here\n\n\nIf wages of an employee have been made up by the employer the\npossibility of recovering the full amount without regard to this various\naccording to the circumstance and in English Law three cases have to be\ndistinguished\n\n\nAnd voluntary payment is not to be concept of his loss of earnings\nCunningham versus Harrison\n\n\nAnd that is exactly the situation here my Lord\n\n\nSo long as the salaries received or the monies received by the\nRespondent were not as a result of an entitlement under his contracts for\nservice then a court has to need or rather need not take into account these\npayments for assessing his loss of earnings\n\n\nAnd in Cunningham versus Harrison the court there ignored the fact\nthat which is on page ninety-eight of my bundle that the court ignored the\nfact that the employers had paid the employee an ex gratia payment for life\n\n\nThen again in Dennis versus London Passenger Transport Board which\nis on page seventy-six of my bundle here again the Plaintiff received as a\nresult of the accident\n\n\nHe was not paid the salaries but he received equivalent to the same\nfirm the Minister of Pensions and from his employers but pension in sick pay\nwhich equivalents which amounts together which equaled to his wages\n\n\nAnd he sued the Tort Freezer and the court held that the fact that\nemployers or others that paid him should or quite voluntarily paid him should\nbe naught\n\n\nAnd if I may just quote from paragraph G of the report the cardinal\npoint to remember is that it is the defendants who are responsible for what\nhas occurred\n\n\nIn my opinion a wrong doer is not to be allowed to reduce damages\nby the extend that the other persons have made up to the Plaintiff his wages\nlike the London county Council versus The Ministry of Pensions in this case\n\n\nShall be paid back to these

{"text": "<$A> \n\nSir the Appellant Defendant's position is that this court\nshould affirm the decision of the judge below and dismiss the Respondent's\nnotice if the court finds the following\n\n\nOne that the general law right of set off and counterclaim has not\nbeen removed by the contract particularly clause thirty-one point eleven\n\n\nTwo that the learned judge below has exercise his judicial\ndiscretion correctly in respect of the interest awarded and his order to stay\nproceedings pending arbitration of the sum of five hundred and nineteen two\nhundred and eighty-four\n\n\nAnd thirdly the Respondents and the Plaintiffs should make a proper\napplication before the Registrar to amend their writ if they intend to pursue\nthe matter relating to the sum of two hundred and six thousand dollars\n\n\nOf course your Honour have allowed the Respondent to amend the\nRespondent's notice earlier on but that is only in respect\n\n\nIf I understand it correctly to amend the Respondent's notice\nwhether or not they will succeed on their submissions is another thing\n\n\nMay I now go straight into the reply to my learned friend's outline\nsubmission\n\n\nYour honour the sub-paragraph the references to the outline\nsubmission\n\n\nIn answer to paragraph two point three of the outline submission the\nAppellants object to the Respondents raising the matter relating to the sum\nof one hundred and thirty-seven thousand dollars on the grounds that A the\nRespondents had conceded before the learned judge below that the same was\nproperly deducted\n\n\nThey are in respectful submission has stopped from raising this\namount\n\n\nI will deal with this matter more fully in my later submission\n\n\nTwo the said sum of one hundred and thirty-seven thousand dollars\nproperly certified by the architects as an amount deductible\n\n\nAs Yong J have correctly pointed out based on my learned friend's\nline of submission it is my observation that that particular certificate\ncertifying the amount of one hundred and thirty-seven thousand dollars as\nbeing payable was made pursuant to the contract\n\n\nAnd if clause thirty-one point eleven is to be given full effect as\nthe marginal note suggests then until such time as this certificate is set\naside full effect must be given\n\n\nMy learned friend has mentioned that they do not know how this\namount was arrived\n\n\nMay I at this juncture refer your Honour to clause thirty-one point\neleven of the contract to be found at page two hundred and eighty of bundle\nmarked the record of appeal R A two page two hundred and eighty R A two\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat page\n\n\nWhat page\n\n<$A> \n\nTwo hundred and eighty your Honour fifth line from the bottom\nof clause thirty-one point eleven\n\n\nIn any case of doubt\n\n\nFifth line from the bottom of that paragraph\n\n\nIn any case of doubt the architect shall at the request of either\nparties state in writing within twenty-eight days\n\n\n\n\n\nOr the nature of any ruling made by him as the case may be\n\n\nSir clause thirty-one point eleven provides for a mode by which\neither party if they are not sure as to how a particular figure is arrived at\nin the certificate to request the architect to clarify and identify\n\n\nThis was not done when the certificates were issued\n\n\nIt was considered before the learned judge below\n\n\nI would submit that until the final determination of the case\neither before the courts or before the arbitrator full effect should be given\nto this particular certificate\n\n\nI pause here to add that this is an order fourteen application that\nwe are talking about\n\n\nIt's not the full trial and the Appellant/Defendant will show that\nthey have raised triable issues for it to be tried in the full court\n\n\nNext sir I turn to paragraphs three to fourteen of the outline\nsubmission at page two of the outline submission\n\n\nSir I will just say that these as my learned friend has pointed out\nrelates to the history of proceedings and he has taken your Honour through\nthose various paragraphs and I don't think I need to address them\n\n\nNext sir paragraph fifteen the revised certificates were held to be\ninvalid by the learned judge below\n\n\nThat is only in respect of the revised certificates\n\n\nHowever it is submitted that certificate number twenty-nine is not\ninvalid or in any event the Defendants have raised an arguable case for\npurpose of Order fourteen proceedings\n\n\nSir may I refer you to page twenty-two of the judgment of Thean J\nto be found at page four hundred and thirty-six R A volume two\n\n\nPage four hundred and thirty-six R A two\n\n\nSeventh line from the second paragraph your Honour at this stage\n\n\nAt this stage it cannot be said that this certificate is invalid\nnor am I in the position to say whether or not the defendants are entitled to\nthis amount\n\n\n\n\n\nIf established is deductible from the amount due to the Plaintiffs\n\n\nSir I pause here to raise clause one point seven\n\n\nThe learned judge has stated that and under clause seven this\namount if established is deductible from the amount due to the Plaintiffs\n\n\nI have considered in my summary reply that we are not relying on\nclause one point seven in respect of the three hundred and eighty-one\nthousand\n\n\nI say it because clearly one point seven does not apply\n\n\nBut I think by drafting it or writing it as the learned judge did\nto say that under clause one point seven this amount if established is\ndeductible from the amount due to the Plaintiffs\n\n\nI think he had in mind the Appellant/Defendant's right of set off\nwhich in our submission has not been removed by clause thirty-one point\neleven\n\n\nSo if they ultimately can establish that this is the amount to be\nexpanded for rectification works the architect can then issue a fresh\ncertificate under clause one point seven\n\n\nThere has been no final certificate issued in this case\n\n\nNo final certificate has been issued in this case\n\n\nSo it is still open to the architect to take into account\nsubsequent factors and issue fresh certificates\n\n\nSo in respect of para sixteen of the Respondent's outline\nsubmission he says in the midst of the proceedings for summary judgment\nbefore the assistant registrar Lojan in an apparent attempt to defeat\nTropicon's application suggested by letter dated twenty-fourth that they\nshould consider taking action under clause thirty-one point four\n\n\nHere the Respondents suggesting that there are something sinister\nor unusual or an unusual act to defeat their claim\n\n\nThe truth of the matter is that clause thirty-one point four\nprovides for correcting of earlier certificates issued by the architects\n\n\nSo it was at that point of time proper for D P architects to issue\nthe revised certificates to correct the original certificates which the\nemployers have indicated to them that you have not taken into account certain\nfactors\n\n\nCan you please look into it\n\n\nSo my answer to that is that it was a legitimate attempt to correct\nthe earlier certificates\n\n\nOn the question of liquidated damages your Honour at page four of\nmy summary having withdrawn our appeal we do not challenge the learned\njudge's ruling on liquidated damages\n\n\nThe Appellant/Defendants would accept for purposes of this appeal\nthat the extended completion date is thirty-first December nineteen\neighty-four for the main building and eighteenth February for the swimming\npool and external works\n\n\nBut we maintained that the practical completion date is first July\nnineteen eighty-five and this is pursuant to a certificate issued to that\neffect this is to be found at page three hundred and thirty three R A volume\ntwo\n\n\nAnd I don't think my learned friend is disputing that practical\ncompletion was first July eighty five\n\n\nSir it is important to note that when the architects certified\npractical completion on this day he did indicate that subject to making good\nof any outstanding items of any apparent defects shrinkages and other faults\nwhich appear during the defects liability period\n\n\nSir I pause here to say that if the dates as stated here are to be\naccepted technically there would have been a delay as far as the main\nbuilding works are concerned a delay of six months\n\n\nAnd taking the agreed liquidated damages to be paid per day that\nworks out to something like three hundred and sixty-six thousand dollars and\nthis I would submit is a bona fide claim a claim which can be substantiated\nif not in this proceedings before the arbitrator\n\n\nSir I go now to paragraph seven of my summary\n\n\nI will skip paragraph six clause thirty one point eleven principle\nregarding deductions and set off\n\n\nSo the marginal note to this clause is effect of architect's\ncertificate\n\n\nIt allows both the employer and contractor to claim on the\narchitect's certificates and in the absence of fraud or improper pressure or\ninterference by either party to obtain summary judgment\n\n\nIt does not however remove the party's right to claim under the\ngeneral law of set off and counterclaim\n\n\nAnd in support of this proposition I rely on the case of Gilbert\nAsh the House of Lord's decision to be found at page one of bundle marked A B\neight\n\n\nSir I have taken the liberty of reproducing the relevant pages\nunless your Honour would want me to refer to the actual report I would rely\non the extracts\n\n\nSir at page one hundred and ninety-eight paragraph D judgment of\nLord Reed where he says the sole question in the appeal is whether by the\ncontract with the sub-contractors\n\n\nThe contractors have agreed that sums which they received from the\nemployers here marked as due to sub-contractors on architects interim\ncertificates must be paid over immediately without any rights of set off\n\n\nSir this is a case involving dispute between the contractors and\nthe sub-contractors\n\n\nI think the principle applies equally to a dispute between employer\nand a contractor\n\n\nNext sir at page two hundred J the judgment of Lord Morris\n\n\nWhen parties entered into a detailed building contract there are\nhowever no overriding rules of principles covering their contractual\nrelationship beyond those which generally apply to the construction of\ncontracts\n\n\nIn other words there are no fixed rules or principles each case\ndepends on the construction of the contract in question\n\n\nOver the page judgment of Lord Morris again nor if the contract\nprovides for the issuing of interim certificates should it be supposed that\nthat's of a special class will come into existence that is that's in relation\nto which there can not under any circumstances be any defence of set off\n\n\nI think there is a spelling typographical error of set off\n\n\nThere was no affidavit filed by the Appellants but it was accepted\nthat the claims which they had made as set out in their defence were bona\nfide claims\n\n\nSir this passage is quoted for the purpose to show that the claims\nthat the employers have against the contractor are bona fide claims and they\nare not frivolous or unsubstantiated claims\n\n\nNext the judgment of Viscount Bilhorn where he deals with the case\nof Donay\n\n\nPrior to nineteen seventy-one and the decision of the Court of\nAppeal in Donays versus Mintah it appears to have been generally thought that\nan employer was entitled to set off a counterclaim against the amount\ncertified\n\n\nIn Halsbury Law of England it is said the contractor is entitled to\nimmediate payment thereof subject to the terms of the contract and any right\nof the employer to set off or counterclaim for example for liquidated damages\n\n\nIndeed no sentilar?? of authority prior to the decision in Donay's\ncase can be found for the proposition that the amount certified by the\narchitect in an interim certificate as the value of work done and\nconsequently payable to the contractor\n\n\nI believe is in a special position in that the employer cannot\nlawfully counterclaim and set off against the liability amounts due to him\nfrom the contractor", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "129619bd-4918-4854-80c9-600eb0b9867a", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nThere are two short points really in this appeal which are\nplainly on the Evidence Act but before I take your Lordships into the middle\nof that I ought to give your Lordships a slight or a fair amount of the\nbackground of this case\n\n\nThe claim itself is for the alleged sale of about six hundred and\nforty thousand shares at three dollars and fifty-six cents in a limited\ncompany\n\n\nThe completion date for that according to the claim was September of\nnineteen eighty-three\n\n\nThe consideration for the delay until completion was that the\nDefendant the Appellant in this case would service an overdraft account at\nfee of the Respondents' banks\n\n\nThis went on to September eighty-four well past completion date when\nfor reasons which I will come to in a moment interest on the overdraft\naccount stopped\n\n\nIn December eighty-four the Plaintiff Respondent sold out and\nthere was a shortfall of approximately one and a half million dollars\n\n\nSome time soon after that two sums of twenty thousand and thirty\nthousand were paid by the or were paid to the Plaintiff my Lord\n\n\nNow that is the claim\n\n\nThe defence there are two parts to the defence your Honours\n\n\nThe first one is that the Defendant applied to strike out the claim\nagainst him on the ground that he was not the defendant or the person who is\nalleged to be the person who purchased the shares\n\n\nThat's been adjourned sine die\n\n\nThe other was based on an Order fourteen application for summary\njudgment and that came before the learned Registrar for hearing on a number\nof occasions and basically this is what the Defendant's claim is\n\n\nThe shares were sold\n\n\nIt was an oral sale there's nothing in writing\n\n\nThe Defendant says or rather the defence is that Khoo I call him\nfor short Khoo the broker says it was a sale to one Gosali\n\n\nIt wasn't a sale but an option to purchase the option to last for\ntwenty-four months\n\n\nMeantime it was to service the overdraft account\n\n\nGosali an Indonesian filed an affidavit confirming this and that he\nwas the buyer\n\n\nAnd then we come to this point your Honour where there was a series\nof discussions when this fifty thousand dollars in two sums were paid\n\n\nNow Mister Gosali put in his account or part of his account to show\nthat in fact he had paid this interest and your Honour will perhaps look at\npage one hundred and twenty-eight of the record where he lists out the\nvarious payments he made through a firm associated with the Defendant\n\n\nNow this is where the link has come in my Lord that's at page one\nhundred and twenty-nine of the record\n\n\nI bring this out my Lord because this startling point must have\nshaken the Plaintiff's claim because this is a certified account my Lord\nshowing the interest payments and they go back a number of years my Lord or\nover a certain period\n\n\nNow this is all filed in the summary proceedings and the issue that\ncame up immediately after that when affidavits were filed my Lord on two\nmatters which are set out in the which I will come to in a moment which were\nset out in the affidavits of the parties\n\n\nNow the first the complaint your Honour are really at page one\nhundred and nine where you will find my Lord that Mister Gosali or Mister\nKhoo says and I ought to go through this now my Lord because this is where\nthe crux of this case is at page one hundred and nine of the record at the\nsecond paragraph there my Lord\n\n\nI approached Mister Gosali with the information given to me by the\nPlaintiff and asked him if he was interested in acquiring the Plaintiff's\nshares on the terms mentioned and after some discussion relating to the\ninformation given by the Plaintiff he agreed to take up the option\n\n\nBy October eighty-four the shares had dropped heavily in value and\nit was discovered that the representations or information given by the\nPlaintiff was false or inaccurate\n\n\nMister Gosali then began to have different views regarding the\nexercise of the option and after negotiations on behalf of Mister Gosali and\nthe Plaintiff the option was cancelled\n\n\nNow this is Mister Khoo's statement your Honour and Mister Gosali\njust the same and supports this statement my Lord\n\n\nNow immediately after that the Plaintiff filed in an affidavit at\npage one hundred and thirty-four as to the rest of the said affidavit and the\naffidavit of Erwan Gosali\n\n\nI crave leave to refer to my affidavit of eighteenth February\nnineteen eighty-six\n\n\nI do not know who Erwan Gosali is and have never heard of him\n\n\nI crave leave to refer to paragraph ten of the affidavit of Erwan\nGosali the negotiations were carried out between the Defendant himself and on\nhis behalf by John Khoo with Mister Subhas Anandan and were on the methods of\npayment of the shortfall represented by the agreed price of two million two\nhundred and seventy-eight thousand and four hundred less the total proceeds\nof six hundred and ninety six thousand and seventy-nine from the sale of S P\nP Limited shares in the market\n\n\nOne of the proposals put forth by the Defendant to Mister Subhas\nAnandan to pay the shortfall of one million five hundred and eighty-two\nthousand and two hundred and thirty-one plus the outstanding interest was by\nway of transfer of three units of housing at One Tree Hill Gardens being\ndeveloped by T K Lim Realty Limited Defendant's company\n\n\nAnnexed hereto is the copy of the telex from John Khoo to Subhas\nAnandan a copy of telex marked G from Mister Subhas Anandan to the said John\nKhoo and a copy of a letter from John Khoo to Mister Subhas Anandan marked H\ngiving specifications and built-up areas of the units offered by the\nDefendant\n\n\nThe proposal was aborted as the development was encumbered and no\nsatisfactory proposal to life the encumbrances came from the Defendant\n\n\nNow my Lords that's the first reply to Gosali and to Mister Khoo\n\n\nNow Mister Khoo then filed some affidavits it's at page one hundred\nand sixty-four at the bottom of the page my Lord\n\n\nAs regards paragraph eleven of the said affidavit I deny that there\nwas any representation made by me on behalf of the Defendant to Mister Subhas\nAnandan who was acting for me in the without prejudice negotiations regarding\nthe balance of the overdraft interest and not the alleged shortfall claim\nagainst the Defendant\n\n\nMister Subhas Anandan had certain bias or interest in the property\nreferred to therein and had requested more particulars thereof\n\n\nCan I read that again my Lord\n\n\nAs regards paragraph eleven of the affidavit I deny there was any\nrepresentation made by me on behalf of Defendant to Mister Subhas Anandan who\nwas acting for me in the without prejudice negotiations\n\n\nThe emphasis my Lord at that point of time this is without\nprejudice\n\n\nThis was also taken at a point of time immediately after the\nPlaintiff put in his affidavit\n\n\nNow my Lord after that Mister Chew goes straightaway and files an\naffidavit at page one hundred and seventy-one where he lists out the various\nproposals and goes deeper into the negotiations my Lord\n\n\nAs to paragraph nine that's page one hundred and seventy-one as to\nparagraph nine of the affidavit annexed hereto and marked C G four it's a\ndraft prepared by Mister Subhas Anandan which incorporated one of the\nproposals made by the Defendant for securing payment of the amount claimed by\nthe Plaintiff by the issue of shares to the Plaintiff by Alitier Private\nLimited which shares were to be paid for by capitalisation of the Defendant's\nloans to his own family company\n\n\nThe proposal set out in so and so fell through and Defendant\noffered to transfer three units of housing in the One Tree Hill Garden\n\n\nFor this purpose I had the valuation of the units made annexed here\nis a copy letter to Mister Subhas Anandan dated twenty-fifth January\neighty-five enclosing the valuation\n\n\nThe price of the units to be transferred to the Plaintiff was to be\nthe payment of the amount due to the Plaintiff\n\n\nAs the price of the three units pegged at two hundred and eighty\ndollars per square foot exceeded the amount of the Plaintiff's claim the\nPlaintiff eventually agreed to take two units and the balance of his claim to\nbe paid by the Defendant in cash\n\n\nI then instructed Messengers Goh Poh and Partners to help in\ndrafting the agreement for this proposal\n\n\nI have heard that searches showed that the property was encumbered\nto the limit of five million\n\n\nAnnexed hereto is a copy of the company's search on Alitier Private\nLimited showing the charges registered against the company and a copy of\ncertificate of title showing the circumstances marked C R T seven\n\n\nGoh Poh and Partners then wrote to Messenger Subhas Anandan on\ntwenty-ninth July as per annexed so and so my Lord\n\n\nNow the learned judge hearing the appeal from the Registrar said\nthat the door had been opened the initial statement made by Gazali and Khoo\n\n\nI haven't read Gazali's one but I will now\n\n\nNow I'll go back again to Mister Khoo first because it's important\nto know whether the door in fact had been opened\n\n\nIt's at paragraph fifteen let me read it again my Lord\n\n\nMister Gazali then began to have different views regarding the\nexercise of the option and after negotiations on behalf of Mister Gazali and\nthe Plaintiff the option was cancelled\n\n\nNow Gazali says your Honour at page one hundred and twenty-eight my\nLord\n\n\nI missed that paragraph ten my Lord of his affidavit Gazali's\naffidavit after a series of discussions between the Plaintiff and my\nintermediaries it was agreed in early December nineteen eighty-four I could\nabandon the option provided I paid interest in the sum of fifty thousand\npayable in two installments\n\n\nI duly paid the same\n\n\nNow this is what is supposed to have opened the door to the\nnegotiations because from then on Mister Khoo promptly pulls the door wide\nopen and brings in various points that were raised and which are in the\nwithout prejudice negotiations which Mister Khoo properly said and gave\nnotice in his affidavit these are without prejudice\n\n\nNow of course the other side or rather the judge has held well you\nshouldn't have put in all these other facts if you say it's without prejudice\nwhy did you not just stop there and just say these are without prejudice\n\n\nIt should be either struck out or removed from the record\n\n\nMy Lord I have an authority to this effect my Lord that you are\nentitled to state your case in the event that you do not be allowed to treat\nthese statements or documents as being in fact without prejudice\n\n\nThe simple reason is a lot of people mark their letters or their\nstatements without prejudice when there is no dispute and no negotiations as\nsuch in the sense that there is a pending court case\n\n\nAnd then they call it without prejudice you see it very often my\nLords\n\n\nI'm sure your Lordships in your long careers must have seen this\nbeing used very freely\n\n\nIt means nothing unless there is a dispute that's going to court\nthe words without prejudice mean absolutely nothing make no effect\n\n\nThey have no effect at all my Lord\n\n\nYou can say without waiving my rights and that doesn't prevent it\nbecoming admissible\n\n\nNow the last affidavit was done on the thirteenth of May my Lord\nand on the twentieth that's three days after the application to strike out\nwas made my Lord\n\n\nNow the two grounds that were given by the learned judge who heard\nthe view or appeal was one that only the parties to the negotiations have\nthis privilege no third party is entitled to it \n\n\nNow may I just point out my Lord, and I've got it in the skeleton\nat page

{"text": "<$A> \n\nMy first point is in regard to the first and second accused's\nability to speak English\n\n\nMy submission basically is that your Honour have had the opportunity\nof seeing the first and second accused in the witness box giving evidence and\nreciting what they alleged were told by the police officers with ease and\nwith precision\n\n\nSentences such as you sign you say yes lah no sign see than man\nhantam you you sign give you makan cigarette go back Bangladesh in that\nprecise order\n\n\nThey have not once mixed up the order and it is my submission that\nthese are hardly the actions of a person who doesn't speak English or who\ndoesn't have sufficient working knowledge of English\n\n\nYour Honour have also got to bear in mind that the first accused had\nspent about two years in Singapore and the second accused had spent about a\nyear and three months in Singapore\n\n\nDuring that period they had contacts with locals and it is by their\nown admission that they picked up local words like makan and hantam\n\n\nThe second accused even went to the extent of saying that he learned\na number of Malay words which he recited to this court\n\n\nAnd it is my submission that through sheer necessity and through\nexposure they had picked up more English words in Singapore than they had\nlearnt in Bangladesh\n\n\nYour Honour have also had the opportunity to see that the two\naccused are reasonably intelligent persons\n\n\nTheir geography of Singapore is also very good\n\n\nDuring that period they picked up names of places in Singapore with\nease\n\n\nThat is hardly again my submission the action of people who were\nilliterate in English\n\n\nThey would have had much difficulty in picking up these words had\nthey not had a working knowledge of English\n\n\nMy other point is that the two of them were also able to\ncommunicate with Asmah binte Salim with whom they were acquainted\n\n\nAnd the second accused had given an example of what he said to\nAsmah on the twenty-first of January nineteen eighty-eight before he visited\nher at her place at MacPherson\n\n\nComing to the assaults that the first accused alleged against the\npolice we first had his evidence that he was assaulted at Dunlop Street on\nthe thirty-first of January nineteen eighty-eight\n\n\nYour Honours have heard evidence from the police officers who\ndenied that they ever assaulted the first accused at Dunlop Street\n\n\nAnd when I cross-examined him his evidence was that there was a\ncrowd there\n\n\nIs it reasonable for the police officers to assault a person whom\nthey were arresting in the presence of a crowd\n\n\nI am asking your Honours to draw the inference that it is not\nreasonable and never took place\n\n\nWe have the evidence of the police officers today that the first\naccused only put up a mild resistance\n\n\nNow in view of that was there any point in them to have assaulted\nhim in a public place\n\n\nThe evidence of the first accused is also at variance with the\nevidence of the police officers\n\n\nThe first accused said he was pushed to a wall after having been\nhandcuffed\n\n\nThe police officers stated that he was never pushed against the\nwall\n\n\nHis hands were placed on the bonnet of a car\n\n\nAgain why should the police officers lie on this point\n\n\nWe now come to the stage where the first accused was taken back to\nthe C I D after his arrest at Dunlop Street\n\n\nHis evidence is that he was assaulted by the police officers in the\ndetectives' office Koh Low and Quek\n\n\nWe have the evidence of Sergeant Quek that it was only he and\nCorporal Koh who were guarding the accused in the detectives' office\n\n\nSergeant Koh was doing the questioning alone pending the arrival of\nInspector Yeoh\n\n\nAgain this is at variance with the first accused's evidence that he\nwas questioned by both Quek and Koh\n\n\nI am asking your Honours to accept the evidence of Sergeant Quek\nthat Koh never interrogated or questioned the first accused and that no\nassault ever took place in that room\n\n\nWhen Inspector Yeoh arrived at the office at eight p m his evidence\nis that he took the first accused into his office where he interviewed\nbriefly and the first accused told him that the second accused who was also\ninvolved in the case was residing at Mandai\n\n\nNow your Honours have heard the evidence of the police officers\nthat they had no difficulty in locating the house at Mandai\n\n\nI am suggesting that if the first accused had merely uttered the\nword Mandai and not specified the location to the Inspector they would have\ngreat difficulty in locating the house\n\n\nMy argument is fortified by the fact that the Inspector has given\nevidence alongside the evidence of Sergeant Quek that the first accused had\ndrawn a sketch-plan of the general locality of the house\n\n\nWe have heard evidence from the first accused that he has stayed\nthere for three or four days\n\n\nIs it therefore unreasonable to suppose that they could have\nproduced such a sketch-plan \n\n\nHe of course denies it altogether \n\n\nHe denies it altogether\n\n\nNow as far as the medical examination forms are concerned your\nHonours have already seen them in conjunction with the reports put up by the\ndoctors\n\n\nThe doctors' reports contain information that were not set out in\nthe medical examination forms\n\n\nAnd it is my contention that it is only the accused themselves who\ncould have volunteered those information to the doctor\n\n\nIf it was my learned friend's contention that the doctor had\ngleaned the information from the police officers then it would be\nself-defeating because it would mean that the accused persons have told the\npolice officers which would in turn lead to the conclusion that they couldn't\nhave been ignorant of the English Language\n\n\nAnd their evidence all along has been that they never spoke one\nword to the police officers during the questioning for the reason that they\ncould not understand the officers\n\n\nComing to the recording of the first accused's statement in the\nfield diary which is Exhibit P fifty-three marked for identification\n\n\nYour Honours have heard evidence from the Inspector that the first\naccused gave him a statement at about ten thirty p m in English\n\n\nInspector has testified in court that the sentence construction in\nthat statement is his\n\n\nHe's not denying the fact but he maintains that the first accused\nwas able to communicate without difficulty in English with him\n\n\nNow it's my submission that your Honour should accept the\nInspector's evidence in this respect because your Honour have seen the way\nthe first accused had given evidence in court and I submit that he was\nconversant in English at the time he gave the field diary statement to the\nInspector\n\n\nAs far as the second accused's statement in the field diary is\nconcerned we have heard evidence from Inspector Yeoh that the second accused\neven told him that he studied up to college level in Bangladesh and studied\nEnglish\n\n\nAnd again it's my submission \n\n\nIt's not suggested that the Inspector has fabricated that \n\n\nNo \n\n\nSo why are you objecting \n\n\nIt must have come from the second accused and your Honour it brings\nme to the point about which are the officers who brought the accused persons\ninto the Inspector's room\n\n\nWe've heard the first accused say that on every occasion it was Koh\nand Low \n\n\nYes \n\n<$A> \n\nBut your Honour would have also heard evidence from the police\nofficers with reference to their lock-up diary their pocket books or whatever\ncontemporaneous records that they had made that on different occasions it was\ndifferent officers who brought them into the room\n\n\nAnd I submit that that piece of contradiction goes to show that the\naccused person had fabricated all the evidence about the assaults that had\ntaken place prior to their being taken into\n\n\nMay it please your Honour \n\n\nYes \n\n\nI am much obliged to your Honour for allowing me to start late\n\n\nYour Honour at the close of yesterday's proceedings I was asked by\nyour Honour to submit on section one hundred and twenty-one of the Criminal\nProcedure Code\n\n\nI have produced before you Sirs two cases which are relevant to\nthis point\n\n\nBut before I touch on those two cases perhaps we could look at the\nwording of 121 again\n\n\nYour Honour section one hundred and twenty-one point one merely\nlays down the general principle that a police officer who is making an\ninvestigation has the power to examine any person including the accused who\nis supposed to be acquainted with all the facts and circumstances of the case\nand that he has an obligation to record in writing what he has examined\norally\n\n\nSub-section two sets out the general principle that when a person\nis examined by a police officer orally he has the obligation to state the\ntruth except that he may refuse to state any fact or circumstance which would\nhave a tendency to incriminate him\n\n\nThat is actually a principle against self-incrimination Section one\nhundred and twenty-one does not say that the person has to be warned of this\nparticular provision of his right not to self-incriminate and this is borne\nout by the two cases which I have produced before you\n\n\nThe first is Public Prosecutor against Chandran and two others\n\n\nThe report is contained in nineteen eighty-nine Clasnews number\nthree page eleven\n\n\nUnfortunately it appears not to have been reported in the Malayan\nLaw Journal\n\n\nYour Honour this is a case of three persons being charged with an\noffence of murder committed in prosecution of a common object of an unlawful\nassembly\n\n\nAnd the relevant parts of the Judgment can be found on page\nthirteen of the report\n\n\nOn page thirteen right-hand column under the heading Trial within a\ntrial the Judge said in that case however objections were strenuously raised\nby Counsel for the three accused with regard to the statement which each of\nthem gave to the police subsequently in the course of police investigations\nwhich are hereafter referred to as the section one hundred and twenty-one\nstatements\n\n\nAccordingly a trial within a trial was held to determine the\nadmissibility of these statements\n\n\nThe section one hundred and twenty-one statement of the Second\nAccused was taken first by Inspector Maniam of the Special Investigation\nSection of the C I D over three days on seventh eighth and twenty-third of\nMay nineteen eighty-five\n\n\nThis statement was recorded in three parts\n\n\nThe third part has been detached because it relates to the personal\nbackground of the Second Accused\n\n\nThe grounds of objection raised by the Second Accused on the first\ntwo parts of the statement were\n\n\nAnd the relevant ground is one a warning substantially in terms of\nthe provisions of section one hundred and twenty-one point two of the C P C\nwas not properly explained to the Second Accused before the commencement of\nthe statement on seventh of May\n\n\nAnd the third ground is also relevant that the warning was not\nadministered to the Second Accused when the statement was continued on the\neighth of May\n\n\nTurning over to the next page your Honour could you look at the\nleft-hand column second paragraph\n\n\nQuite apart from this question whether or not the warning was\nproperly administered to the Second Accused there is the more general\nquestion as to whether there is any requirement that the warning must be\nadministered to an accused before he gives his statement\n\n\nWe do not think there is anything in section one hundred and twenty\none that requires that this be done\n\n\nNor do we think that a failure to administer the warning to an\naccused renders his statement taken down under section one hundred and twenty\none is inadmissible in evidence under section one hundred and twenty two\npoint five of the C P C", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nMuch obliged my Lords\n\n\nMy Lords if I may take this appeal in the manner in which I have\ndealt with in my skeletal arguments\n\n\nUnless your Lordships have should say otherwise my Lords and I shall\nproceed to go through briefly the facts which because of the nature of the\narguments which will be raised subsequently\n\n\nThey are some of them are material for the purpose of this appeal\n\n\nMy Lords this appeal arises from a decision of Chan Sek Keong\nJudge?? be it on the twenty-sixth day of July nineteen eighty-nine ordering\nthe petition filed herein by the Appellants in his company's winding up\npetition number seventy-seven of nineteen eighty-nine\n\n\nOn the seventh day of March nineteen eighty-nine he struck out and\nthe action dismissed on the grounds that the petition and/or the proceedings\ninstituted by the Appellants thereunder constitute an abuse of the process of\ncourt\n\n\nTwo the cause of this application herein detects and paid by the\nAppellants to the Respondents and the company\n\n\nNow in so far as the facts which are material to this appeal are\nconcerned my Lords my Lords may I be permitted to proceed with paragraph two\n\n\nThe Appellants are members and minority shareholders of Chong Lee\nLeong Seng Company Private Limited herein after referred to as company and on\nthe seventh of March nineteen eighty-nine instituted proceedings under the\nCompany's Act Chapter fifty in Company's Winding Up Petition number\nseventy-seven of nineteen eighty-nine to seek relieve under section two\nhundred and sixteen of the Act against certain of his directors\n\n\nOn the grounds that the latter A had conducted the affairs of the\ncompany in a manner oppressive to one or more of the members of the company\nincluding the Appellants and/or in this regard of the Appellant's interest as\na member of the company and/or B who are exercising their powers as directors\nof the company\n\n\nIn a manner oppressive to one or more of the members of the company\nincluding the Appellants and/or in disregard of the Appellant's interest as\nmembers of the company and/or C had acted\n\n\nAnd are then or are threatening to act in a manner which unfairly\ndiscriminates against or is otherwise prejudicial to one or more of the\nAppellants as members of the company\n\n\nThe principle relieve served by the Appellants was for the company\nto be wound up by the court under the provisions of the Company's Act with\nother relieves prayed for\n\n\nMy Lords pausing here for a moment if I may just refer your\nLordships to the petition itself just to page twenty-seven of the record my\nLords which sets out the relieve sought by the Appellants in their petition\npage twenty-seven of the record\n\n\nHave your Lordships got that page\n\n\nNow your Lordships will note preceding the prayer for relieve there\nis a statement my Lord in that paragraph beginning with in the circumstances\nand I read my Lord in the circumstances the Petitioners have been advised\nthat it is just an equitable that the company be wound up\n\n\nAnd then the prayers go on in prayer A one sorry my Lord that Chong\nLee Leong Seng may be wound up by the court under the provisions of the\nCompany's Act\n\n\nSo my Lord what I wish to stress at this point in time is that the\nrelieve sought if I may expand on that my Lord are one a winding up under the\njust an equitable rule which is under section two hundred and fifty-four my\nLords of the Company's Act\n\n\nTwo hundred and fifty-four my Lords if I may refer you\n\n\nAt page three hundred and forty-eight of the Singapore Statutes\nchapter fifty\n\n\nNow I would like to draw your Lordship's attention to two\nprovisions in that section section two hundred and fifty four point\n\n\nOne reads the court may order the winding up if and then we go on\nto F\n\n\nThe directors have acted in the affairs of the company in their own\ninterest rather than in the interest of the members as a whole or in any\nother manner whatever which appears to be unjust unfair or unjust to other\nmembers\n\n\nAnd under I the court is of the opinion that it is just an\nequitable that the company be wound up\n\n\nSo that my Lords this section two hundred and fifty-four comes\nunder the division of the Company's Act relating to the winding up by the\ncourt\n\n\nAnd I intend to later develop the argument that in the case of\noppression so to speak my Lords the Petitioner or the oppress minority so to\nspeak may have availability to wind up under section two hundred and\nfifty-four or two hundred and sixteen\n\n\nAnd the nature of my arguments will be that two hundred and sixteen\nprovides for an additional ground for winding up\n\n\nAnd that has been confirmed my Lords by the learned judge in his\njudgment itself\n\n\nBut suffice it to say my Lords at this point in time it is\npertinent to point out indeed two revealing sections in the Companies Act\nrelating to winding-up so to speak in respect of acts committed by officers\nof the companies and in which relief is being sought by a shareholder\ngenerally called the oppressed shareholder my Lords\n\n\nMy Lords the petition was presented on the seventeenth of March\nnineteen eighty-nine under the provisions of the Companies Winding-Up Rules\nnineteen sixty-nine\n\n\nAnd in accordance with Rule twenty-three thereof the Registrar\nappointed twenty-first April eight-nine as the date on which the petition was\nto be heard\n\n\nThe petition was thereupon served on the company on the twentieth\nof March eighty-nine and the persons named therein as the Respondents that is\nthe directors of the company\n\n\nNow my Lords this date twentieth March is significant because of\nthe arguments which will later be developed on the question of whether there\nwas any waiver of the irregularity if any\n\n\nNow on the seventh of April nineteen eighty-nine the petition was\nadvertised as required by Rule twenty-four of the nineteen sixty-nine rules\n\n\nOn the eighth of April and tenth of April nineteen eighty-nine a\ntotal of four affidavits were filed on behalf of the company in opposition to\nthe relief sought under the petition\n\n\nSo after the appearance of the advertisement four affidavits were\nfiled by the Respondents by the company\n\n\nOn the tenth of April nineteen eighty-nine the company through\ntheir solicitors applied for and were granted a validation order under the\nprovisions of section two hundred and fifty-nine of the Companies Act\n\n\nThat is under the winding-up division inter alia that payments made\nby the company and on its behalf including payments out of the company's bank\naccounts\n\n\nAnd all other transactions and dispositions of property by and on\nbehalf of the company and in the ordinary course of business up to\n\n\nAnd including the date on which the petition is disposed of shall\nnot be avoided by virtue of the provisions of section two hundred and\nfifty-nine of the Companies Act\n\n\nHowever before the petition could be heard on the twenty-first of\nApril nineteen eighty-nine the company on the fourteenth of April that is\nafter having filed the four affidavits in reply in opposition to the petition\nand after having applied for the validation order on the thirteenth of April\nthen applied for an order under Order eighteen Rule nineteen of the Rules of\nthe Supreme Court\n\n\nAnd my Lords this is where the second part the record of appeal\nwhich we have tendered in that sets out the summons-in-chambers\n\n\nAnd it would be I think necessary to just look at the\nsummons-in-chambers and see what precisely was the relief sought by the\nRespondents\n\n\nThis is at Record of Appeal Bundle Two summons-in-chambers\n\n\nThe Applicants prayed for the following orders\n\n\nOne that the time for service of this application be reached\n\n\nTwo that pursuant to Order eighteen Rule nineteen point one and/or\nthe inherent jurisdiction of this honourable court the petition herein is\nstruck off and the action be dismissed on the grounds that the petition\nand/or the proceedings instituted by the Petitioners there under constitute\nan abuse of the process of court\n\n\nIf I may just digress for a moment my Lords what they are saying is\nbecause the Petitioners had instituted the proceedings in the way they did\nthat act of commencement under the winding-up rules constituted an abuse of\nthe process of court and it was on that ground and no other that the\nsummons-in-chambers to strike out was filed and upon which the order was\nsubsequently made by the learned judge\n\n\nThree that pursuant to his inherent jurisdiction this honourable\ncourt may make such orders as it deems fit for the purpose of remedying the\nconsequences of the said abuse\n\n\nAgain my Lords the whole tenor of the application was abuse of the\nprocess of court\n\n\nAnd of course Prayer four that summons my Lords is a question the\nprayer for costs which we need not deal with\n\n\nMy Lords as we understand it if I may resume with paragraph eight\nof my skeletal arguments the main ground for the allegation of abuse of\nprocess is that proceedings for any relief from oppression must be commenced\nunder Order eighty-eight of the R S C and not under the winding-up rules\n\n\nAnd therefore ought to be struck off under Order eighteen Rule\nnineteen or under Order ninety-two Rule four of the R S C\n\n\nThat is basically the main attack my Lords of the procedure adopted\nby the Appellants that it must be commenced under Order eighty-eight\n\n\nThe application was heard by Chan Sek Keong Justice in chambers on\nthe twenty-first of April eighty-nine\n\n\nThat was day on which it was assigned by the Registrar my Lords to\nhear the petition itself\n\n\nAnd by way of a reserved judgment dated twenty-sixth July nineteen\neighty-nine Chan Sek Keong Justice ordered the petition to be struck out on\nthe ground that it was improperly presented as a winding-up petition under\nthe Companies Winding-Up Rules sixty-nine since he was of the view that the\nproceedings ought to have been properly commenced by way of a petition\npursuant to the provisions of Order eighty-eight of the Rules of the Supreme\nCourt nineteen seventy\n\n\nAnd if I may just at this point of time conveniently refer to Order\neighty-eight my Lords\n\n\nIt's at page two hundred and ninety-five of the R S C and that\norder is entitled the Companies Act nineteen sixty-seven which is our present\nChapter fifty my Lords\n\n\nNow if your Lordships were to look at Rule five the following page\n\n\nThe following applications under the Act must be made by petition\nand this rule my Lords prescribe the mode of commencement of the various\nactions under the Companies Act namely applications and we are only concerned\nwith H my Lords\n\n\nUnder section one hundred and eighty-one of the Act for relief in\ncases of oppression\n\n\nThe section one hundred and eighty-one mentioned therein is now\nsection two hundred and sixteen of our revised statutes my Lords of the\nCompanies Act\n\n\nSo my Lords what Rule five of Order eighty-eight prescribes is the\nmode of commencement and if I may just this may be basic\n\n\nBut I think it's needed to stress at this point in time my Lords\nthat there are only four modes of commencing proceedings in the High Court in\nSingapore namely the writ of summons originating summons petition and\noriginating motion\n\n\nOnly four modes in which to commence originating process in the\nHigh Court\n\n\nAnd Rule five prescribes that an action for relief under section\none hundred and eighty-six must be commenced by petition\n\n\nSo that my Lords if for instance an oppressed shareholder decides\nto commence by way of a writ of summons then of course he would have used the\nwrong mode for commencement and that mode would be totally one which is\ncontrary to Order eighty-eight Rule five H \n\n\nAnd it is necessary my Lords to stress at this point of time this\nargument because as I develop my arguments further my Lords what the\nRespondents did in this case was also to commence the action by way of a\npetition under the winding-up rules So the mode of commencement is important\nWhat Order eighty-eight prescribes is the mode of commencement", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c1c39658-eeaa-4227-a0d2-07743b0698ec", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.688766+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nMay it please you my Lord\n\n\nWe are finally here for the purpose of presenting to your Lordship\nour submissions on this matter and in respect of which the hearing has gone\non almost four days three days\n\n\nIn fact I have my Lord at the beginning of this trial given to your\nLordship the list of authorities I will be relying on in support of my\nclient's case and this morning my Lord I have in fact given to my learned\nfriend and to your Lordship's secretary a very brief submission on what the\nissues are in this case\n\n\nWhat I plan to do my Lord is this as I see it from the Defendant's\ncase what I plan to do my Lord is this to perhaps just go through the issues\nwith your Lordship and then with your Lordship's permission to go through the\nlist of authorities and perhaps go through the law as well subject\n\n\nOf course at any time to your Lordship stopping me and saying that\nit will not be necessary for me go through it if your Lordship has in fact\nread through it\n\n\nI have in fact in submitting these authorities highlighted in my\nbundle the paragraphs that I will be reading\n\n\nSo with that my Lord if I may be permitted to start\n\n\nAs I see it my Lord the issues in this case are very simply did the\nPlaintiff when she transferred the subject property to the Defendant intend\nthe transfer to be a gift of the property from her to her son\n\n\nThat's the first issue my Lord that has to be decided upon\n\n\nIf it was a gift then that is the end of the matter with regard to\nthe subject property\n\n\nIf on the other hand my Lord the Court is of the view that it was\nnot a gift that the question that then comes up for consideration was whether\nthe as to whether or not the property was transferred to the Defendant on the\nterms that the Defendant was to be a trustee of the property and he was to\nre-transfer the property back to the Plaintiff after she had obtained her\nidentity card\n\n\nNow with regard to this these two issues the Plaintiffs of course\nrely from their statements of claim on the point of undue influence\n\n\nThe third question that your Lordship has to consider is whether\nthere were any conditions governing the use of the money held in the bank\naccount opened in the joint names of the Plaintiff and the Defendant\n\n\nMy Lord with regard to the first question the Defendant's case is\nthat the property was transferred by the Plaintiff by her own free will to\nthe Defendant\n\n\nNow in support of this my Lord I rely on the Defendant's own\nevidence as well as the evidence of the Defendant's second witness\n\n\nIn further support of this statement I am also relying my Lord on\nthe certificate of title which quite clearly indicate in the agreed bundle\nthat the property was transferred as a gift\n\n\nOf course my Lord I concede that this evidence of the Defendant is\ndenied by the Plaintiff and hence therefore the Court will have to decide as\nto which of the parties testimony is to be believed\n\n\nIn short my Lord the case falls on which of the two parties are to\nbe believed the Plaintiff or the Defendant\n\n\nIt's my case my Lord that notwithstanding the cross-examination by\nthe Plaintiff both the Defendant and his witness have maintained their strong\nposition on the evidence\n\n\nWith regard to the second point it is my submission my Lord that\nthe question of a trust cannot arise\n\n\nThis is because if it was so the transfer of title would have\nevidenced and this in support further support of this I rely on the evidence\nof the Defendant to prove this\n\n\nMy Lord having said this may I just draw your Lordship's attention\nto the pleading itself\n\n\nThe action itself my Lord admittedly was commenced by a different\nfirm of solicitors to my learned friend\n\n\nAnd in the supplemental bundle of pleadings at page six your\nLordship will see from the amendments that were made to the pleadings as to\nexactly what was the Plaintiff's case before the twenty-sixth of July\nnineteen eighty-eight when the amendment was when the statement of claim was\namended for the first time\n\n\nBefore the amendment the Plaintiff's case was that there was an\narrangement between the Defendant and the Plaintiff that she would have the\nsame right and enjoyment over the property prior to the transfer\n\n\nWhen the amendment was made she says for the first time on the\ntwenty-sixth of July nineteen eighty-eight that the transfer was induced and\nthen she says it was without independent advice\n\n\nFor the first time these two allegations are made\n\n\nAnd for the very first time she then states what the inducement is\n\n\nI draw this to the Court's attention because I think it plays an\nimportant part when one comes to read the testimony of the Plaintiff\n\n\nIf this was true if it was true that she was induced to transfer\nthe property and if it was true that she was induced to transfer the property\non the basis of undue influence my question my Lord is why was this not\nstated from the first moment she started this action\n\n\nWhy has she held it back and only subsequently chosen to produce\nthis line of thinking\n\n\nThe query that I have is is this sincere or has this been built up\n\n\nHas this argument been built up by her in order to create a\nsituation where there was undue influence when in fact there was none\n\n\nEven with regard to the question of the transfer of the property\nback to her the allegation that when she gets the identity card back the\nDefendant would have to transfer the property back to her surfaces for the\nfirst time only after twenty-sixth July nineteen eighty-eight\n\n\nAnd likewise the condition that the Plaintiff should be allowed to\nstay in the property for the rest of her life\n\n\nHas she been honest to this Court in saying what she has said\n\n\nAdd to it my Lord is the fact that she now says that there was\nill-treatment\n\n\nThat's not much of a new point I concede because it was there\nbefore the amendment was made\n\n\nBut certainly she has made the allegation even more serious by\nstating that she was forced to move out of the property and has then sought\nto rely on the care and concern of her two daughters for abode\n\n\nMy Lord I draw this to the Court's attention and leave the Court to\ndraw its own inference as to why this has been stated at such a late juncture\n\n\nLooking at the amended looking at the defence of the Defendant\nthere can be no doubt his stand has always been as it has been\n\n\nAnd the amendments that were made in the amended defence were\nmerely the consequences of her sad and pitiful story as put up by her if it\nis true\n\n\nAnd if one looks at the defence one would see that it tallies very\nmuch factually with what the Plaintiff herself has admitted in this context\n\n\nI refer to the allegations that she was performing illegal\nabortions that she had a criminal record for that and the fact that he denies\nthat there would be a re-transfer of the property\n\n\nThe next point my Lord which I would like to make is this namely\nthat I would ask the Court to draw its own inference as to why it has taken\nthe Plaintiff so long to commence this proceedings and to seek the Court's\nremedy for a declaration\n\n\nYour Lordship would see when I go through the law that such an\ninference can be drawn from the facts of this case\n\n\nMy Lord it cannot be doubted from the evidence that has been\npresented to this Court that the Plaintiff is not as educated as her son has\nbeen who has been fortunate to be\n\n\nBut even he too my Lord does not enjoy that sort of education that\nperhaps the other two children of the Plaintiff have\n\n\nP W two she says is a programmer certainly it calls for education\nmuch higher than what the Defendant has prior to that being a school teacher\n\n\nMy Lord it cannot be doubted further that the Plaintiff is a\nthrifty person very much a characteristic of perhaps that generation\n\n\nBut one has got to look at her in the light of her mother\nsixty-nine years of age widowed since thirty-seven but with only one son and\ntwo daughters\n\n\nFrom the evidence that has been given to this Court she denies that\nshe had made a gift of this property\n\n\nShe supports her argument by the evidence of P W two\n\n\nIf one goes through the evidence of P W one she admits her illegal\nabortions when she admits her record\n\n\nIt confirms the evidence of the Defendant on this\n\n\nBut where her evidence goes out of the way is on the question as to\nwhether there were conditions attached to the gift\n\n\nHere she relies for strength and support on the testimony of P W\ntwo\n\n\nMy Lord my client does not deny and his evidence bears it out and I\nthink the mother's evidence bears it out too that he loved his mother and his\nmother loved him\n\n\nBut where the dispute comes about my Lord is the fact that on the\nunfortunate day when P W two choose to return back to the home and that\nquarrel took place that that's when this whole case began\n\n\nIt is my submission my Lord that if one looks at the evidence of P\nW one objectively and then looks at the evidence of P W two in the light of\nwhat the defence has said it is extremely clear that this whole litigation\nhas been motivated by and brought about by events that took place and the\ncircumstances and the relationship that now exists between P W two and the\ndefence witness one\n\n\nHaving said this my Lord may I be permitted to look at the evidence\nof the Defendant with regard to the transfer of the house notwithstanding\ncross-examination by my learned friend\n\n\nHe maintains his point though perhaps in a strong and hard way that\nthere was never any conditions attached to the property being transferred to\nhim\n\n\nHe admits that there was the sad circumstances surrounding his\nmother's record but denies in any way that that played any part in causing\nher to transfer the property to him or was even instigated or motivated by\nhim that she should do so\n\n\nThat being so my Lord one has got to therefore take out these\nfactors and see whether such a person as the Plaintiff could have transferred\nthe property as a gift to the son\n\n\nA little supplemental factor that comes into play is I think the\nfact which cannot be denied that perhaps there was a bad relationship that\ntook off between the Plaintiff and her daughter-in-law\n\n\nIt may have been prompted by the fact that the Plaintiff had not\nbeen invited for the Defendant's wedding but then his evidence speaks for\nitself when he said that it was a very simple ceremony that he had and that\nthere were only two witnesses present\n\n\nI think my Lord it must be so that in a Muslim marriage the\nwitnesses can only be Muslims\n\n\nThe evidence of D W two supports the point that the mother was\naware of the fact that her son was in the company was frequently in the\ncompany of a Muslim lady and subsequently converted to the faith\n\n\nLook at that my Lord in the light of the character of the Plaintiff\ncharacter of the Defendant as set out by D W two \n\n\nMy Lord I think it's a fact to say that converts tend to be\nstronger in their faith than born, people born in the faith and I think from\nthe opening evidence of the Defendant it's quite clear that he is a staunch\nMuslim now brought up in the teachings like in all other religions that one\nshould respect one's parents", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nYour Honour I have put up briefly written submissions based on\nthe main issues adduced in this trial and I will go according to the subject\nmatter accordingly\n\n\nYour Honour the

nineteen eighty-three which is evidence in\nexhibit one and two of the agreed bundle\n\n\nYour Honour it is very pertinent to note that these contract was\ndrafted by the Defendant company and not by the Plaintiff's company\n\n\nIt is only countersigned by the Plaintiff's company at the end of\nthe contract at page two\n\n\nYour Honour I submit that the subject matter of contract evidence by\nthis letter from the Defendant company was for the Defendant to supply\napproximately eight thousand tons of P W D B one asphalt premix to the\nPlaintiff's project at Yio Chu Kang Road hereafter I will just refer to the\nproject your Honour\n\n\nIt was not a contract to supply all the asphalt premix which was\nrequired by the project\n\n\nYour Honour my inference is based on the following points the\nparties contemplated that the Defendants will supply and lay approximately\neight thousand tons of asphalt premix to the project at sixty-six dollars\n\n\nYour Honour the meaning of the word approximately means about or\nmore or less and this is this meaning has in fact been given by the candidate\nCourt of Appeal case in British Wheat Carbassing Company Limited versus E D\nEddie company limited reported in nineteen twenty-one fifty-nine Normally law\nreport page seventy-seven which can be found in the Plaintiff's bundle of\nauthorities at page twenty-three to twenty-eight\n\n\nIf your Honour would refer to the Plaintiff's bundle of authorities\nto this particular case at page twenty-three which I submit that this case\nhas some relevance to our case in point\n\n\nYour Honour this is before the Supreme Court of Canada and in this\ncase the facts are stated in the headnote\n\n\nAn agreement for the sale and purchase of paper contained the\nfollowing clause\n\n\none hundred and fifty tons approximately of paper per year\n\n\nAnd it was held your Honour the court held that on the proper\nconstruction of these clause that the contract was for the sale of one\nhundred and fifty tons of paper per year\n\n\nThe word approximately was only to provide against incidental\nvariations arising from slight and unimportant excessors or deficiency and\nthat each year must stand by itself the contract not being for four hundred\nand fifty tons during a three year period\n\n\nThe words being the whole of the purchase requirements did not form\nany controlling part of the contract and were merely an intimation as to the\npurchaser's requirements\n\n\nYour Honour I quoted this case merely to show you the meaning of\nthe word approximately it doesn't much go much further than that\n\n\nHere the contract will sell approximately one hundred and fifty\ntons of paper per year and that instead supplied short of it\n\n\nAnd I think the issue before the court is revolves the word around\nthe word approximately and it was held that we have to give incidental\ndeficiencies and surpluses to that figure\n\n\nSo in our case the figure eight thousand tons was provided for and\ntherefore the actual tonnage supplied by the Defendant company was seven\nthousand seven hundred and thirty-five point ninety one tons which is only\nthree point three per cent short and therefore the word approximately would\ncover the shortfall of three point three per cent\n\n\nMay I carry on your Honour\n\n\nNext the caption re-surfacing of road at Yio Chu Kang Road in the\nsaid contract at page one your Honour\n\n\nIf you look at the caption it merely says servicing of road at Yio\nChu Kang Road\n\n\nIt is submitted that this caption was used conveniently to\nfacilitate easy reference in the exchange of correspondence between the\nparties\n\n\nThe caption did not specified the exact points between which the\nDefendants were to lay the asphalt premix\n\n\nThe Plaintiff's contract with P W D in contrast and as pleaded in\nparagraph one of the statement of claim and admitted by the Defendants was to\nconstruct and widen Yio Chu Kang Road second carriage way from Sembawang\nHills to Jalan Kayu\n\n\nP W D's contract was very specific from which points of Yio Chu\nKang Road to which point\n\n\nThe contract made between the Plaintiff's company and the\nDefendant's company never mention the exact points between which asphalt\npremix had to be laid\n\n\nNext your Honour clause three of the contract at page one thereof\nit says that please note that we are not responsible for the variation in\nthickness laid as our quotation quoted to you is on metric weight only\n\n\nYour Honour I submit that the word our quotation must referred to\nthe quotation as evidence in this contract and the quotation is an offer to\nsupply approximately eight thousand tons of asphalt premix\n\n\nThere cannot be any other things besides this which is so clearly\nprovided for in clause two\n\n\nThis is reinforced by the word metric weight only and metric weight\nyour Honour I submit must refer to the eight thousand tons metric tons of\nasphalt premix referred in clause two\n\n\nTherefore clause three obviously show the intention of the writer\nthat this quotation is an offer to the Plaintiff's company to lay to supply\nand lay approximately eight thousand metric tons of asphalt premix at\nsixty-six dollars\n\n\nAny other construction would make this contract redundant in a\nsense that if it is to lay the whole of the project then there is no need to\nmention a quantity in the asphalt premix to be supplied\n\n\nYour Honour it is also given by P W one witness F W one in this\ntrial that it is customary unusual for contracts of this nature to always\nbear a limit on the tonnage to be laid\n\n\nNext your Honour the Defendant's statements of supply as shown in\nthe agreed bundle and for most of them they have printed words like site and\ntons and even have column for quantity supplied tons and balance to be\nsupplied tons\n\n\nThese words are not put there for fun they must have served a\npurpose\n\n\nThis is basically to show or it would indicate to the defending\ncompany when they have breached the approximate limit\n\n\nIf indeed the contention is that it was for the Defendant to supply\nthe whole of the Asphalt premix then there is no necessity when they are\nlaying the premix in stages to keep track of the tonnage laid\n\n\nIt's not necessary in fact they should have just add up the total\ntowards the end of the whole project and say oh this is ten thousand tons and\ntwelve\n\n\nI submit your Honour that all these clauses and words used in this\ncontract point to the fact that the parties contemplated at page three of my\nsubmissions your Honour paragraph H contemplated a quantitative definition of\nthe subject matter of the said contract\n\n\nAnd this subject matter was uppermost in the minds of the\ncontracting parties when they make the contract and it was definitely not an\nopen-ended contract where no quantity or tonnage is specified\n\n\nThe subject matter to be gleaned from all these wordings and from\nthe evidence and testimony in this court in totality re-enforces the\nPlaintiff's version that this contract was a simple one\n\n\nIt was for the Defendant company supply of approximately eight\nthousand tons of Asphalt premix at sixty-six thousand dollars\n\n\nAnd not for the Defendant to supply the whole of the Asphalt premix\nrequirement for the project\n\n\nYour Honour it is also pertinent to note that the total tonnage\nlaid for the whole project by the Defendants and Resources Development\nCorporation total up to nine thousand eight hundred and forty-four point\nfourteen tons\n\n\nAnd in percentage terms it is twenty-three per cent more than the\nestimated eight thousand tons stipulated in the said contract\n\n\nYour Honour P W one witness P W one had been in the road\nconstruction business since nineteen sixty-two and is unlikely given his\nexperience and expertise to under provide twenty-three per cent of Asphalt\npremix required by the project\n\n\nTherefore P W D's testimony that he estimated eight thousand of\nAsphalt premix for part of the project from Ang Mo Kio Avenue four to Yio Chu\nKang Track fourteen is credible\n\n\nD W one and D W three corroborated P W one that a figure of eight\nthousand tons of premix originated from the Plaintiffs\n\n\nOn this first point your Honour I submit this conclusion that the\nDefendants had supplied seven thousand seven hundred and thirty-five point\nninety-one tons of Asphalt premix to the project\n\n\nIt had been permitted to perform its obligation to supply\napproximately eight thousand tons\n\n\nThe shortfall of two hundred and sixty-four point zero nine tons or\nthree point three per cent of the estimated eight thousand tons is small\ngiven the nature of this type of contract\n\n\nAnd the circumstances of this case and the de minimis rule should\napply to absolve the Plaintiff from being liable for this shortfall\n\n\nIf I may proceed your Honour I will go on to the next point on the\ncannons of construction of written contracts\n\n\nIn the case of clear and unambiguous contract your Honour I submit\nthat the contract was clear unequivocal and free from ambiguity\n\n\nThe words used therein are to be construed in their plain ordinary\nand popular sense\n\n\nClauses one and two of the contract and three in their plain and\nordinary meanings can only be interpreted to mean that the Defendants were to\nsupply deliver and lay approximately eight thousand metric tons of Asphalt\npremix at sixty-six dollars per ton\n\n\nClauses one and two and three I may add are not susceptible of any\nother interpretation\n\n\nThe Defendant's contention that they were entitled under the said\ncontract to supply all the Asphalt premix required by the project contradicts\nor varies Clauses one two and three of the contract\n\n\nAnd where the words of a written agreement have a clear and fixed\nmeaning extrinsic evidence is not admissible to show that the parties meant\nsomething different from what have written \n\n\nNinety-four \n\n\nSection ninety-four of the Evidence Act precludes the admissibility\nof the testimony of D W one and D W three which seeks to show that the\nparties meant something different from what have been written in the contract\n\n\nYour Honour the next point is this the Defendants drafted the\ncontract which was countersigned by the Plaintiffs\n\n\nThe rule of construction is that a deed or other instrument shall\nbe construed more strongly against the grantor or maker thereof\n\n\nThe contra proferentum rule is best summarized by in a case of John\nLee and Son versus Rail Executive and I quote a passage of Abasad Master of\nthe Roll\n\n\nWe are presented with two alternative readings of this document\n\n\nAnd the reading which should be adopted is to be determined among\nother things by a consideration of the fact that the Defendants put forward\nthe documents\n\n\nThey have put forward a clause which is by no means free from\nobscurity and have contented that it has a remarkably if not extravagantly\nwide scope and I think that the rule contra proferentum should apply\n\n\nAs in our case your Honour this is a typical case of a written\ncontract where the Defendant company is seeking to expand the scope of the\ncontractual matter so extravagantly\n\n\nAnd I would urge your Honour to apply the contra proferentum rule\nagainst the Defendant\n\n\nI do not admit that this contract is ambiguous and capable of two\ninterpretations\n\n\nBut indeed it is then I submit that the contra proferentum rule\nshould be used against the Defendant who was the drafter of the contract", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "72ab806e-eb98-408d-9c14-f3fcd3759ed0",

{"text": "<$A> \n\nMay it please you my Lord\n\n\nI appear together with my learned colleague Mister Loh Chai Chong\nfor the Plaintiffs and my learned friend Mister Isaac Nathan together with\nMister Brown appear for the Defendants my Lord\n\n\nMy Lord we are grateful for your Lordship for having given us\ngranted us the indulgence to start this case a little late primarily because\nwe wanted to get some primary documents from the Police officer concerned\n\n\nNow he has arrived and he has given part of the documents but he\nhasn't got a complete list\n\n\nSo he's trying to locate the other part now\n\n\nBut in any event for present purposes I think I'll put him in the\nwitness-box at the appropriate stage and introduce his evidence and then\nperhaps later on he can come back and let us have the remaining documents my\nLord\n\n\nMy Lord the issues in this case are fairly straightforward whether\nof fact or of the law\n\n\nThe Plaintiffs' claim is really for the value of certain Caterpillar\nspare parts that were stolen by a conspiracy of two of their employees and\ntwo other persons from the outside\n\n\nThe conspirators finally sold all the stolen goods that will be our\ncase to the Defendants\n\n\nAnd the Defendants themselves and that will appear from the various\ndocuments in the bundle or documents my Lord sold to unknown third parties\nsome of those parts which were stolen\n\n\nThe last instalment which was stolen was recovered by the Police\nwho were alerted by the Plaintiffs and they laid a trap and caught the\nculprits red-handed and that last instalment valued at about one hundred and\nsixty thousand dollars was recovered by the Police and returned to the\nPlaintiffs\n\n\nIt will be the evidence of the Plaintiffs my Lord that the total\nvalue of the lost articles is approximately five hundred thousand Singapore\ndollars and we will lead evidence as to how we arrived at that figure and\nalternatively damages\n\n\nSo the issues are fairly short and they are as follow my Lord\n\n\nFirstly in purchasing the stolen articles from the conspirators and\nsubsequently disposing of them if the Defendants converted those goods\n\n\nThat's the first issue in law\n\n\nWere the goods converted by the Defendants\n\n\nIf so what were the value of those goods\n\n\nNow going through my learned friend's bundle of authorities last\nnight my Lord we noticed that they are going to run a defence of\npurchase-in-the-market goods\n\n\nNow we have ourselves gone to the point and my learned colleague\nMister Loh Chai Chong has done some work and he would like to make his\nsubmissions on the law on that point my Lord with your Lordship's permission\n\n\nNow if I may at this stage just introduce the bundle of documents\n\n\nThe first one is the bundle of pleadings my Lord which consist of\nthe statement of claim and the defence\n\n\nHas your Lordship got it \n\n\nPlaintiffs' bundle of documents Volume One \n\n\nNo my Lord it's on the pleadings my Lord bundle of documents lodged\npursuant to Order thirty-four Rule three point six\n\n\nThat's the one yes\n\n\nThat consists of the statement of claim which is in very short form\nand the defence my Lord which is also in relatively short form\n\n\nBefore I deal with the statement of claim my Lord I'll deal with\nI'll introduce the other bundle of documents as well\n\n\nWe have two Plaintiffs' bundle of documents in two volumes Volume\nOne and Volume Two \n\n\nVolume Two is described as supplementary bundle \n\n\nThat's right my Lord bundle of documents Volume Two\n\n\nNow my learned friend has got two documents Defendants' bundle of\ndocuments Volume One and Volume Two\n\n\nNow quite a few of the important documents are repeated in both\nbundles in other words Plaintiffs' bundle as well as the Defendants' bundle\nmy Lord\n\n\nAnd at some stage both my learned friend and myself we'll get\ntogether for the purposes of agreeing so that we can have one common bundle\nas an agreed bundle\n\n\nFor the time being my Lord he says that he wants to preserve his\nposition as to the relevance of some of the documents in my bundle anyway\n\n\nNow the Plaintiffs' Volume Two supplementary bundle is not agreed\nmy Lord\n\n\nMy learned friend says that he's going to object to it depending on\nthe use that I'm going to put that document to that's right isn't it \n\n\nThat's the computer thing I refer to my Lord \n\n\nThat's right\n\n\nSo we won't be marking these bundles at this stage my Lord\n\n\nThank you very much\n\n\nSo going back to the bundle of pleadings your Lordship sees in\nparagraph two\n\n\nIt's been asserted that the Plaintiffs were the owners and entitled\nto possession of the Caterpillar spare parts to the value of five hundred\nthousand dollars and that from the period January nineteen eight-three to\nSeptember nineteen eighty-three at fourteen Tractor Road Singapore the said\nCaterpillar spare parts and other spare parts to the value of five hundred\nthousand dollars were stolen from the Plaintiffs' warehouse by Mohamed Taz\nKhan Ramachandra Ng Kin Sai and Madam Liau Pau\n\n\nAll the said stolen Caterpillar spare parts of the said value of\nfive hundred thousand dollars were old and delivered by the above-named\nMohamed Taz Khan Ramachandra Ng Kin Sai and Liau Pau Min to the Defendants\nduring the said period from January nineteen eighty-three to September\nnineteen eighty-three\n\n\nThe Defendants then being in possession of the said stolen\nCaterpillar spare parts have sold pledged delivered and/or otherwise dealt\nwith or disposed of the said Caterpillar spare parts to a person or persons\nunknown without the Plaintiffs' consent express or implied whereby the\nPlaintiffs suffered loss and damages\n\n\nAnd they claim five hundred thousand dollars my Lord\n\n\nMy Lord the defence is interesting\n\n\nParagraph one the Defendants deny receiving the said stolen\nCaterpillar spare parts\n\n\nThey do not admit what's alleged in paragraphs two and thirty of\nthe statement of claim and in paragraph three they want to say as follows\n\n\nAt all material times the Defendants' purchased they say in the\nordinary course of business certain Caterpillar spare parts from foreign\ncompanies situated in the United States of America Europe and Japan and the\nlocal spare parts dealer namely Uniborn Enterprise Company then having its\nregistered office at Number thirty-five Kallang Pudding Road etcetera\nSingapore\n\n\nThe Defendants bought the aforesaid spare parts in good faith and\nwithout notice of any defects or want of title on the part of Uniborn\nEnterprise Company and paid a reasonable market price for the said goods\n\n\nNow we asked for further and better particulars my Lord of these\nallegations and we have them my Lord in a separate document\n\n\nMy Lord before I deal with the particulars further and better\nparticulars can I ask your Lordship to have a look at page forty-five on the\nVolume One of the Plaintiffs' bundle of documents my Lord forty-four\n\n\nIt's a copy of our letter of second October nineteen eighty-six\naddressed to my learned friend's firm in which we say we refer to your\nclient's defence filed and served on the Plaintiffs of thirteenth August\n\n\nHaving examined the defence we are satisfied that our clients the\nPlaintiffs in the above Suit are entitled to the following further and better\nparticulars of the defence of the suit\n\n\nUnder paragraph three on the allegation made by your clients that\nat all material times the Defendants purchased in the ordinary course of\nbusiness certain Caterpillar parts etcetera kindly give full particulars of\nthe alleged purchase of the Caterpillar spare parts from such foreign\ncompanies and local spare part dealers especially Uniborn Enterprise Company\nas follows and there we set it out my Lord paragraph one\n\n\nParagraph two please state from whom in particular these alleged\npurchases were so made and whether they were oral or written and if written\nidentifying the document or all documents in which these alleged purchases\nwere in point\n\n\nThree please state whether these alleged purchases were paid for\nand if so paid for whether in cash by cheques or any other form of payment\nand four please state to which person or particular persons in such company\nor companies such payments were so made\n\n\nThe answer to that letter my Lord appears on the next page page\nforty-six\n\n\nIt says we are instructed that our clients are long established as\ndealers of spare parts and have been purchasing spare parts over a long\nperiod of time from companies situated in the United States of America Europe\nand Japan\n\n\nThe identities of suppliers of these parts we are instructed cannot\nbe disclosed at this stage as it may be prejudicial to our clients\n\n\nOur clients consider this information as confidential and we\ntherefore regret that our clients cannot accede to your clients request\n\n\nWe then made applications of court and obtained necessary orders my\nLord and the next stage in these proceedings appears on page fifty of that\nbundle\n\n\nIt's our letter of the sixth of March eighty-seven to my learned\nfriend's firm\n\n\nWe refer to the further and better particulars of the defence dated\nthirteenth August nineteen eighty-six filed and served by you pursuant to the\norder of court dated fifth January eighty-seven and to the answers given to\nrequest one two three and four thereof which our clients feel are inadequate\nas follows\n\n\nIn respect of Items A to F in the Defendants answer to request\nnumber one the Defendants have not disclosed the type of Caterpillar spare\nparts giving the part numbers and amounts in respect of each of such parts\nallegedly sold to the Defendants\n\n\nIn respect of Defendants' answer to request number two therein the\nDefendants have not given the name of the person from whom the Defendants had\nmade these alleged purchases\n\n\nIt is clear from the request that the Plaintiffs want the name of\nthe person from whom the alleged purchases were made as it is very clear from\nthe Order made by the Honourable Chief Justice on the fifth of January\nnineteen eighty-seven that all the requests in the further and better\nparticulars relate to Uniborn Enterprise Company\n\n\nIn respect of the Defendants' answer to request number three the\nDefendants have failed to answer whether the cheques were cash bearer or\ncrossed cheques\n\n\nIn respect of the Defendants' answer to request number four the\nDefendants have failed to answer to which person or particular persons\nUniborn Enterprise Company such payments were so made\n\n\nAnd we asked for those further particulars\n\n\nAnd what appears my Lord in that document that I handed over a few\nminutes ago are the further particulars that were submitted and this is what\nthey say the answer under paragraph one my Lord appears on page two\n\n\nThe Caterpillar spare parts bought by the Defendants were bought in\nlots without identification of part numbers and amounts of each of the parts\n\n\nAs the same were mixed with the existing and newly purchased parts\nfrom various overseas suppliers the identity of these parts cannot be\nobtained by the Defendants\n\n\nUnder paragraph two the answer is the Defendants made the purchases\nfrom a person by the name of Albert and who claimed to be the boss of Uniborn\nEnterprise\n\n\nUnder paragraph three my Lord the answer is to the best of the\nDefendants' knowledge the following purchases were made by the Defendants in\nthe manner provided hereunder and they give particulars of the cheques that\nwere allegedly issued by the Defendants to Albert it will appear later is\nMister Ng Kin Sai of the conspirators my Lord\n\n\nThe other relevant documents that I would like to refer your\nLordship to in the bundle of documents are as follows my Lord\n\n\nI think I'll start off with my learned friend's bundle and that's\nVolume Two of the Defendants' bundle of documents my Lord\n\n\nThe very first letter on page eight Volume One my Lord Defendants'\nbundle of documents\n\n\nPage eight my Lord it's a letter of fourteenth November nineteen\neighty-three written by my learned friend's office to affirm to the\nofficer-in-charge Jurong Police Station in which they say my Lord that we\nunderstand that your officers have arrested one Mister Lim Chee Teck\n\n\nI believe he's one of my learned friend's witnesses under section\nfour hundred and eleven chapter one hundred and three for the purchase of\ncertain spare parts and have released him on a bond pending further\ninvestigations", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "8d62ef44-4a52-42b4-b4e4-1950a67d09e4", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.692039+00:00"}

more quality of life\n\n\nThe PAP is very good at giving you the bread and butter the bread\nand butter issues but when it comes to the quality of life they are hopeless\n\n\nWhen you got your jobs when you got your three meals a day when\nyou got your flat and you want a better quality of life come to the\nopposition\n\n\nWe have all the ideas we can give you a better quality of life and\nwe can give you some fun on the way and have a few laughs at the same time\n\n\nNow they talk about the Next Lap\n\n\nThey want to endorse the Next Lap\n\n\nWhat is in the Next Lap\n\n\nHave you seen that book\n\n\nIt's got a nice cover\n\n\nA coffee table book is one that you never open the cover because\nyou got to see the inside\n\n\nThere's nothing there there's no substance\n\n<$B> \n\nAt Bukit Batok the SDP candidate Mr Ling How Doong picked on\nthe topic of increases in costs of education\n\n<$G> \n\nAll of you must be aware that government have slowly\nconverted most of the schools to independent school and of course after the\nconversion the fees goes up between seventy-five to two hundred dollars\n\n\nIt is slowly beyond the reach of most of us here and uh that is\nnot the problem \n\n\nYou the government is telling you very well if you can't go to\nindependent school you can always go to the other government school but all\nthe good teachers qualified teachers experienced teachers have been attracted\nto the independent school you would expect a much higher standard of living\nin the independent school to attract you people to go to the independent\nschool and the University fees have been increased many times I can well\nunderstand if the government has got no money but the government has been\naccumutat accumulating vast surpluses every year to the tune of nine billion\ndollars a year and yet the government is not prepared to subsidise more for\nour children education\n\n<$A> \n\nAt Nee Soon where the PAP held a dialogue session the\nMinister for Information and the Arts Brigadier-General George Yeo said the\nPrime Minister's right to govern must be confirmed in this general election\nYeo: Mr Goh Chok Tong's right to govern must be confirmed in the general\nelection and for this reason in every constituency he is the candidate The\nrest of us we are just supporters we are his representatives If we are\ncomfortable with his vision if we are comfortable with his style of\ngovernment if we are comfortable with the team he has brought around him then\nlet us show it in a resounding way and the stronger the backing he gets from\nus the more effective his leadership can be This is the issue and it is very\nimportant that the voters of Singapore in this general election bear in mind\nall the other issues are really technical matters but if we get this right\nand if we unite around Mr Goh Chok Tong then Singapore's future will be\nsecured you know really we're feeling uncertain we do not know what may\nhappen next No one expected this coup in the Soviet Union and very few\nexpected that this coup will collapse so quickly and who knows what may\nbefall us next month or the month after when news reached Singapore about the\ncoup immediately the stock market plunged over sixty points When the coup\ncollapsed stock market went buck up went back up again The world is too small\nno distance is too great it is one global village whatever happens anywhere\nwill affect us directly and what is most important is that we are united and\nwe work together and we have the instinct to care for each other then our\nfuture will be secure\n\n<$A> \n\nDuring the dialogue session residents took the opportunity\nto discuss issues which concern them This ranged from new identity cards the\nopposition's call to people to vote in more opposition Members of Parliament\nand the proposed Edusave scheme P: Mr Goh Chok Tong has come up with the\nEdusave scheme which signals the government concern over the less affordable\npopulation This is a good sign but now the scheme only catered for students\nwho wants to take up the extra-curricular classes So obviously the scheme\nwill only go to a group of people who may not even require the subsidy Since\nit is the intention of government to help the less affordable why not allowed\nthose student nuh to allow the scheme to make use of the scheme to pay for\ntheir tuition classes uh textbooks and so on and so forth that i think will\nbe more constructive Yeo: you're right i think this is the way the government\nwill eventually go because what we do not want is to treat human beings like\ncommodities to be produced and assembled in the production line where every\nproduct looks the same what we want is to respect each individual for what\nthey are as individuals different and unique and for each individual to\ndevelop to the limit of his God-given potential in a sense the education\nsystem must be customised for him so Education Ministry's policy si to move\ntowards greater choice for parents and then schools and teachers will then\nrespond to the pattern of parental choice what government will do through\nEdusave is to give to parents these kids as it were to place as they wish in\na way they think will best bring up the children and invest in their\npotential we are starting in a limited way because the system can easily be\nopened to abuse but as we go along as we gain experience as we get more\nfeedback as principals and teachers and parents think of new ways of\ninvesting better in their children then i think the system will broaden P:\nNow there has been rumours that uh medical fees parking coupon fees and uh\nhospital ward charges will be increased after might be increased after the\nelection In fact the opposition is capitalising on this issues can you please\nenlighten us Yeo: We must not forget that the people who work to provide us\nthese services The people who work in Telecoms who work in hospitals doctors\nnurses attendants they're also Singaporeans they're also want to enjoy six\neight percent improvement in their standard of living every year so they'll\nhave to be paid for so from time to time adjustments will have to be made but\nover a period of time we must try to keep costs as low in Singapore as\npossible and indeed any economist any statistician who looks at costs in\nSingapore basic necessities education health whatever will know that in\nSingapore we have just about the lowest inflation rate in the whole world for\nthe last twen ten to twenty years The lowest inflation rate in ten to twenty\nyears That is quite an amazing quite an amazing achievement Why why does the\ngovernment do that The government keeps inflation rate down because all of us\nhave our savings in the CPF and it's very important that we keep the value of\nthe Singapore dollar steady Otherwise if there's inflation really it is\ngovernment breaking off your savings and my savings isn't it Yes of course we\nmust expect the opposition to always harp on the negative side on the cost\nincreases but they never mention when our telephone rates go down the\ntechnology improves They never talk about the improvement in services and\nmost of all the increase in the incomes of Singaporeans and in their assets\nIn the old days i mean to eat two bowls of rice was a nec necessity because\nyou work a lot and you needed all the calories but today people are very\nconscious you know I mean they will cut down the rice the the chicken skin\nthey'll put aside so we have made tremendous progress and i hope that\nsometimes when there're irritations when you know particular fees go up that\nwe take a step back and say look let's take a look at the overall balance\nsheet has life improved have we been better off have we been better off\ncompared to other countries ten years ago twenty years ago we have done very\nwell and what we want to do the PAP government is to continue with this\nprogress this development this yearly increase in our quality of life and in\nour standard of living but of course the market is not is unequal in its\noutcome and some people do much better off than others so the PAP is\ncommitted to making sure that those at the bottom however bad their luck or\nwhatever mistake they make or whatever problems they may face that at the\nbottom if they are in trouble we will help them\n\n<$A> \n\nAt the dialogue session in Bukit Timah Mr Lee Hgn Kiang an\nunopposed PAP candidate of Tanjong Pagar GRC said the Prime Minister's\nconsultative style of leadership isn't something abstract He gave two\nexamples of how it affects people's lives in concrete ways Kiang: Nowadays\nwhen we develop plans at the ministries or the departments we take special\ncare to consult the people who are affected by all these plans I can give one\nexample Even when we develop parks we now bring the plan of the park to the\npeople and say, \" This is what we are developing are you happy with it\" and\nwe are surprised with the results that comes out For example we're developing\na neighbourhood park and the residents say, \" look we have a very active qi\nkong group here hundred members Why don't you change the park a little bit so\nthat we can have our qi kong practice in the park instead of uh in the in the\nfield between the blocks Uh so we mange to do that and they're all happy The\nthe park is is served the the people better and the people are happy that\nthey are consulted and they got concrete results in the development of the\npark In the last few years we've also stepped up town councils That is\nanother very concrete example of how the Prime Minister's new style has led\nto a change in the way we run things in government This is in fact the seed\nof local government being planted and it will evolve more participation more\nconsultation more decisions devolve down to the ground So when the Prime\nMinister put his leadership style as an issue in the general election please\nunderstand that this is not something that is abstract This is going to\naffect all our lives in very concrete ways\n\n<$B> \n\nSport The Pan-Pacific Swimming Championships in Canada world\nchampion American Jeff Ruse has clinched the second best time ever in the one\nhundred metre back stroke 54.67 seconds

Heights\nand Nee Soon Central and the PKMS in Ayer Rajah\n\n\nAt a Workers' Party in Hougang Dr Lee Siew Choh its candidate for\nEunos GRC said there's no democracy in Singapore\n\n\nWhen you talk about democracy you would allow people to hold small\nmeetings together discuss political issues of the day so that you know they\ncan exchange views and maybe make suggestions to the government but in\nSingapore you are not allowed to do that\n\n\nIf you speak up and you speak up against the government they may\ntake action against you\n\n\nTherefore it becomes very difficult for people to gather to talk\nabout things\n\n\nMany people have a lot of views they discuss it behind the scene\n\n\nThey talk it in their rooms in their family circle between friends\nin club maybe\n\n\nBut if you were to ask them to come out openly and identify\nthemselves with the opposition they have to say they dare not\n\n\nTherefore in Singapore today there is an atmosphere of fear and\nthis atmosphere of fear we must try and get rid of\n\n\nEverybody must help to get rid of this fear\n\n<$B> \n\nAt the SDP rally its candidate for Braddell Heights said the\nPAP has been lucky so far\n\n\nIn nineteen sixty three the PAP dominant dominating the whole of\nthe political environment of Singapore\n\n\nNow there are such reason there there were reason for that where\nwe know we understand because at that time it's a turbulent world\n\n\nNot only that Singapore is in trouble where poverty unemployment\nbut the whole world is such\n\n\nYou look and recall in nineteen sixty in India in China they are\nnot as good as today\n\n\nSo the whole world has progressed progressed over the thirty years\n\n\nSo the PAP they are in a way very lucky that they are in power for\nthe last thirty years and when they talk about the achievement of today in\nSingapore they said this is achievement by us by PAP not by you\n\n\nI think that is absolutely wrong\n\n\nWithout the support without the hardworking of the people no\ngovernment can success\n\n<$B> \n\nSpeaking later the same rally the party Secretary-General Mr\nChiam See Tong says it is wrong to believe that the opposition does not\nsupport the good efforts of the PAP\n\n\nThe PAP has always try to make it a bad picture of the opposition\n\n\n\nThey want to always make it as if the opposition wants to stop\nprogress It is absolutely not true We are Singaporeans We are in the\nopposition Why? Because we are concerned for our country Therefore it is\nwrong to say that we want to hold back progress It's absolutely not true In\nfact if the government does good things we will say yes please do more for\nthe people We should not say because it is done by PAP no no no good we don't\nwant If the PAP wants to build hospital here we said okay please go ahead\nbuild one more We don't mind if they get the name for it because it's good\nfor Singapore It does not mean that because it is done by the PAP we say it's\nbad We are constructive we are supportive of all good cause and in fact it is\nour duty to make sure the PAP do only good for Singapore\n\n<$B> \n\nThe Singapore Malay National Organisation PKMS held their\nfirst rally this evening in Ayer Rajah Candidates touched on the racial\nharmony the rising cost of living and criticise the Next Lap Its candidate\nfor Jurong Mr <unclear> word </unclear> said the publication did not have\nwhat he called soul It's in the Next Lap You must <unclear> word </unclear>\nscrutinise it and understand it then you will see some thing emerging a\nmonster and a Frankenstein So that is why we demand that uh if the PAP are\nsincere we demand to know who are the office of the Next Lap and we demand to\nknow what books of references they referred to when they compile this book\nand we demand to know the sources of that knowledge Name your books the PAP\nname your books of reference and you will be rest assured that we dare probe\ninto the sources of their knowledge but with the caution of our soul\n\n<$A> \n\nAt the PAP rally in Eunos the Prime Minister Mr Goh Chok\nTong took to task the Workers' Party Mr Jufrie Mahmood for mixing religion\nwith politics He said Mr Jufrie's been making communal and religious\ninsinuations and <unclear> word </unclear> definitely agitating the Malay\nground by speaking only in Malay in the hope that Chinese voters won't know\nwhat he's saying Mr Goh cited several instances when this was done At\nWorkers' Party rally last week Mr Jufrie accused his PAP opponent Mr Sidek\nSaniff of selling out the Malays and of attempts to buy the Malays Mr Goh\nsaid in the last election Mr Jufrie also attacked PAP Malay MPs repeatedly\nfor taking a moderate line and working in co-operation with the PAP\ngovernment to improve the lot of the Malays instead of taking a\nconfrontational stance I'm happy that Jufrie has come up openly with his\nposition Yes Sidek Saniff supported the tertiary scheme proposal He was in\nthe forefront persuading Malays those Malays who can afford it to give up the\nprivilege of free university education he wants them to pay and he wants the\nmoney to be given to Mendaki to help the poorer Malays and this policy is not\nSidek's policy It is my policy I suggested it Our policy is right because our\npolicy is aimed at making the Malays help themselves so that they can compete\nwith the Chinese and Indians and at the end of the road they can do well and\nthey can claim that it is through their own merit and ability that they are\nable to stand tall Now as for separation of religion and politics Sidek\nSaniff believes that politics and religion must not mix It is too potent a\nmixture if you mix politics with Islam you allow Buddhism to be mixed with\npolitics you mix politics with Christianity then that spells for trouble So\nhe's speaking out of his heart when he supports the separation of politics\nfrom religion But Jufrie says that is wrong he wants to mix religion with\npolitics Well you try and do that in Singapore you are going to end up with a\nbig fire right away Just look at India look at Sri Lanka where politics are\nmixed with religion What has happened in India what has happened in Sri Lanka\nwill happen very quickly in Singapore if we mix religion with politics\nJanuary nineteen eighty-five I was appointed Deputy Prime Minister You can\ntrace the record between nineteen eight-five and now to see what we have done\nto fulfill a promise in that document <unclear> word </unclear> nineteen\nninety-nine MRT we've got it today Indoor Stadium we said we we would build\nit we have built it Town councils we have got them HDB refurbishing on the\nway Pilot projects are now being done in six areas So that program is on the\nway Mendaki formed Mendaki one Mendaki two I said we should form a special\ncommittee to help the Malays Mendaki two has been formed and now we are going\nin for Sinda to help the Indians And after we have helped the lower income\nIndians after we have formed Sinda we are going to form a development\nassistance committee for the Chinese There are also poor Chinese don't think\nall Chinese are rich In fact there are more poor Chinese than poor Malays and\nIndians put together So we will focus our attention to help the lower income\nChinese If I succeed in forcing a bond with you I meet you at dialogue\nsessions once in two weeks after election I go down I give the meet the\npeople face to face there is no need for opposition and if PAP leaders become\narrogant please give us a knock on the head No it it is possible that\nsometimes ideas get to get into our head if there are very few opposition\nmembers in parliament it is possible that we become complacent we become a\nlittle swell-headed I say it is possible for myself I don't think that is\npossible I cannot change but assuming that it is possible you will be our\nsafeguard you will be the people who will check us The PAP the government are\nnow big enough to accommodate a range of views In our early days we would not\ntolerate dissenting viewpoints we were like a samphan and we believe like a\nsamphan you cannot allow people to tussle to quarrel on a samphan because the\nsamphan will capsize but today I believe we are more like a big boat the\nbottom is flatter it is very flatter very like a ferry you see like a ferry\ncorrect like a ferry Thank you That's what I meant by participation of the\npeople I did not have the right word or the right metaphor but the idea grew\nforth ferry Yes on a ferry we can we can accommodate a range of opinions and\nI have allowed encouraged people to air their opinions Now you read the\nStraits Times You read SBC you watch SBC People now criticise the government\nthey come up with alternative ideas Opposition are free to criticise us I\nsaid go ahead so long as we know that certina areas are off limit like\nlanguage religion race so long as we keep away from these areas it is alright\nYou can criticise my program you can criticise my style you can offer a\nbetter style a better program I accept And if ideas are good I co-opt them\nAgain which is why the opposition has not come up with any ideas First I\nthink they are incapable of coming up with ideas and if they have to help us\nto govern you know what I will do I will co-opt their ideas So in parliament\nif in parliament or outside they do come up with an idea to help me govern\nSingapore better I will say thank you very much Mr Chiam I'm going to\nimplement it and if I do that my government will become better say My\ngovernment becomes better by nineteen ninety-six

{"text": "<$A> \n\nGood evening the main reports tonight\n\n<$B> \n\nThe Land Transport Select Committee recommends ways to control\ncar growth\n\n<$A> \n\nThe Philippine government gets more powers to investigate those\nsuspected of involvement in last month's coup attempt\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd the Politburo of Rumania's communist party is arrested\n\n<$A> \n\nWe begin with a report by the Select Committee on Land\nTransportation on ways to control the car population\n\n\nOne of its major recommendations is the introduction of the quota\nsystem to ensure a target car population growth rate is maintained\n\n\nThe Chairman of the Committee Dr Hong Hai explains\n\n<$B> \n\nWe think the quota system will work better because it set it\nattains the target directly\n\n\nIt says four percent six percent growth whatever and uh allows the\nmarket price to adjust to attain that level of growth\n\n\nThere are possibly some misapprehensions about what the quota\nsystem will lead to\n\n\nBut first is the idea that somehow the quota system is going to\nprevent many people from owning cars\n\n\nThis is totally untrue\n\n\nUnder the quota system you could also go and buy a scrap car or you\ncould scrap your car and with the certificate you get buy a new car\n\n\nSo that doesn't change at all What has changed is what price you\npay to buy a new car when you don't have a scrap car to trade in right\n\n\nIn the past the price is fixed at the ARF value In the future if\nthe quota system is implemented the price is going to depend on market\nconditions at that time\n\n\nWe've advocated and I think it's most reasonable that the\ngovernment would would would uh go along that the quota should not be\nsomething that is very secretive or very confidential\n\n\nThe government should be quite open to to allow people to\nunderstand its rationale for whatever quota it is going to set whether it's\nfive percent six percent three percent whatever\n\n\nLet people know well in advance what it's likely to be so that\nthere is no uncertainty in the market so that dealers cannot go out and\nspread rumours that oh next year it's going to be zero so you better buy your\ncar now\n\n\nThat sort of thing\n\n\nWe don't think therefore that the the government uh should be we\nthink the government should be open about it and therefore speculation\narising from uncertainty of the quota in the future would be minimum\n\n<$A> \n\nThe Committee also said the present PARF scheme should be\nretained for all existing vehicles\n\n\nBut for newly registered cars the scheme can be refined so that\ncars disposed of earlier will get a better value\n\n\nAs for the evening Area Licensing Scheme the Committee has asked\nfor it to end half an hour earlier at six thirty\n\n\nIt also suggested further studies on the effectiveness and need for\nan evening ALS\n\n\nOn parking charges the Committee said the rate should reflect the\nsocial <unclear> word </unclear> the city and congested areas\n\n\nBut car-park prices in housing estate(s  should not be determined\nby traffic control objectives as it had only a minor impact\n\n\nAs for public transport the Committee believes there may be a case\nfor granting capital subsidies to feeder services for the MRT\n\n\nIt also said improvements for road transport should continue to\nmeet the people's aspirations to own cars\n\n\nA special program on the report by the Select Committee will be\ntelecast after the news on this channel\n\n<$B> \n\nSingapore's trade rose in November last year It grew by nearly\neleven percent compared with the same period

missing for nine days now\n\n\nAnd this is where the action is\n\n\nSome eighty officers from the Police Field Force have been deployed\nfor this search and villagers have joined in as well\n\n\nFour such command posts have been set up to comb the entire\nmountain\n\n\nTomorrow another platoon of thirty officers will be sent up Gunung\nBelumut described as uninhabited and densely forested\n\n<$A> \n\nFamily members of the missing hikers are also in Kampong Gajar\n\n\n\nInterviews with family members of missing hikers \n\n<$B> \n\nKluang Police says search operations will continue

two guiding principles were adopted in\norganizing the activities for the month\n\n<$B> \n\nAll the major organizations Indian organizations in Singapore\nare cultural sporting or otherwise will in some way be be involved\n\n\nSo I want to stress that this is a total community effort rather\nthan uhm effort by few individuals\n\n\nThe second point which I uh want to stress is that the programme is\nso drawn up to attract maximum participation of all Singaporeans\n\n\nThis is not a programme for Indians only\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd the committee has chosen a ceremonial elephant decked in\nred and silver as its logo\n\n\nInsofar as the colours are concerned the red denotes universal\nbrotherhood and unity of the various races in Singapore and silver uh denotes\nour link with and participation in the twenty-fifth anniversary celebrations\nof the nation\n\n<$B> \n\nWhile many children in Singapore yesterday were getting used\nto the difficulties of going to school their little friends in

main difficulty besides the height is the wind because\nbeing up so high the wind is pretty strong and this will affect the repellers\nwhen they're descending\n\n\nSo they have to uh spread out their

carabina and this device which is called figure-of-eight\ndescender\n\n\nThis is quite an important safety device because first of all it\naids him to in doing his braking\n\n\nSo when he brakes the figure-of-eight the way it's configured slows\ndown the descent and stops descent completely\n\n\nMeanwhile when he's descending freely this figure-of-eight\ndescender enables the rope to glide freely

that improving the education system is a\nprocess which may have a beginning but no end\n\n<$A> \n\nEach step or improvement that we make throws up new challenges\nwhich we have a responsibility to address\n\n\nThe progress which we in Singapore have made in the last\ntwenty-five years is encouraging because it shows that with effort\ndetermination and very important adequate financial provision we\ncan improve the quality of the teaching force and raise the\nstandard of education in a country\n\n<$B> \n\nImprovement of primary level education will be the subject of\ndiscussion at the schools

their\ninterest\n\n\nThe themes range from environmental issues to our multi-cultural\nmulti-religious society\n\n\nThe students didn't get any help from their teachers\n\n\nThey chose the subject did the research and put the pieces together\nall on their own and they could only use scrap material\n\n\nZhong Ker Ping and her two friends from Mayflower Primary chose\ncommunications because they say

as they don't carry regular reports on Singapore and have not\ninterfered with our domestic affairs\n\n\nBut three other regional publications AsiaWeek Yachochokan and\nMedia will need

four day surgery suites have been planned to handle more\npatients and new anaesthetic drugs which help the patients to regain\nconsciousness in just minutes will help this\n\n\nWith these drugs patients can be up and about in just a short time\nand they can go home in just two hours\n\n\nDoctors say that the mobility helps them to recover faster\n\n\nThere'll also psychological advantages if

{"text": "<$A> \n\nGood evening\n\n<$B> \n\nThe Soviet Foreign Minister resigns\n\n\nIn home news the Select Committee of the Elected President Bill\nproposes amendments in its report\n\n\nIn Parliament the government has decided to promote the use of\nunleaded petrol and to give the building authority greater powers to deal\nwith squatters and the Acting Minister for Information and the Arts\nBrigadier-General George Yeo calls for confidence and optimism in our effort\nto promote Asian culture\n\n<$A> \n\nParliament began today with the swearing-in of the two newly\nappointed nominated members Mr Leong Chee Wah and the Associate professor\nMorris Choo\n\n\nThey'll serve as NMPs for a period of two years\n\n\nParliament today also heard details of plans to introduce unleaded\npetrol for use by cars\n\n\nFrom July all imported petrol-driven vehicles will have to be able\nto use unleaded petrol and from January nineteen ninety three all new\npetrol-driven vehicles will have to be fitted with catalytic converters\n\n\nIn a ministerial statement the Environment Minister Dr Ahmad Mattar\nalso reveals that from the first of February there'll be a price difference\nin favour of unleaded petrol\n\n<$B> \n\nThe tax on unleaded petrol which is more expensive to produce\nwill be reduced from fifty percent to forty eight percent from February\n\n\nWhile for leaded petrol an additional tax will be levied to make it\nabout ten cents per litre more expensive than unleaded petrol\n\n\nThis means that if the current pump price for leaded petrol is one\ndollar nineteen cents the new price in February will be one thirty four for\nleaded petrol and one twenty four for unleaded petrol\n\n\nIt was also announced that from July nineteen ninety one all\npetrol-driven vehicles imported for use in Singapore will have to be able to\nuse unleaded petrol\n\n\nDr Mattar said in the meantime the ministry will work with oil\ncompanies and motor traders to advise motorists on whether their cars can\nswitch to the use of unleaded petrol and all companies have been very\nsupportive of this switch and said it was a logical extension of the\nministry's long-term goal of a more environmentally conscious society\n\n\nThere are at present about three hundred and thirty two thousand\npetrol-driven registered cars on our roads and about ninety percent or three\nhundred thousand cars are able to switch to unleaded petrol\n\n\nThe remaining thirty two thousand cars which are mainly cars older\nthan seven years cannot use unleaded petrol and most of the motor-cycles on\nour roads can also use unleaded petrol\n\n\nDr Mattar explained that in Singapore the main source of lead in\nthe air is from vehicle emission\n\n\nAlthough the lead content in our air is well within safe levels our\ncar population is growing and if the lead content in petrol is maintained at\ncurrent level the growth in car population will result in rising lead levels\nin the air which can have damaging effects on health\n\n\nThe Ministry has assured the public that it will not be stopping\nthe sale and use of leaded petrol since about ten percent of the cars in\nSingapore will still need to use leaded petrol\n\n\nAnd from January nineteen ninety three there'll be stricter\nemission standard for all new petrol-driven vehicles\n\n\nThey will need to have catalytic converters to convert harmful\nhydrocarbons and other gases to safe ones like carbon dioxide nitrogen and\nwater\n\n\nBut Dr Mattar said because catalytic converters will be damaged by\nlead present in leaded petrol they cannot be introduced until after unleaded\npetrol becomes widely available and is used in Singapore\n\n<$B> \n\nAmong the bills passed by the House today with the Building\nControl Amendment Bill it gives the building authority more powers to deal\nwith unauthorized structures especially those built by squatters on private\nland\n\n\nIn moving the bill's second reading the National Development\nMinister Mr S Dhanbalan said by the end of this year squatters will be\ncleared from some three hundred and fifty lots of private land all over\nSingapore and by nineteen ninety two some four thousand seven hundred\nsquatters on state land and more than one thousand five hundred on land\nmanaged by the Malayan Railway administration will also have to go\n\n<$A> \n\nThe government had in nineteen eighty set a target of ten\nyears to make Singapore squatter-free Much has been achieved\n\n\nUp to October this year the government has cleared more than one\nhundred and fifty thousand squatter cases on state land\n\n\nHowever Mr Dhanabalan said the heaviest concentration of squatters\nis found on land along the railway track Malayan railway authorities have\ntried to clear these squatters since nineteen eighty six but they've not been\nvery successful\n\n\nMr Dhanabalan said many of these structures are make-shift huts\nerected without permission and are dangerously sited on both sides of the\nrailway track\n\n\nThey are safety hazards potential fire risks and blights on our\nenvironment\n\n\nFor those who have to be relocated today will be the cut-off date\nto qualify for resettlement benefits\n\n\nthose who move into the squatter areas after today will not qualify\nfor the benefits\n\n\nIt's costing the Singapore government thirty seven point five\nmillion dollars in the <unclear> word </unclear> instance to pay for\ncompensation and clearance\n\n\nThe Malays in government has agreed the cost will be recovered when\nthe authorities returned the land to Singapore\n\n\nThe first phase of the clearing from Kampong Silat to Upper Bukit\nTimah Road will start in January while the second phase stretching right up\nto Woodlands is expected to start at the end of next year\n\n\nThe government has given the assurance that this will be done with\nas little dislocation as possible\n\n\nThe amended bill also sets out new procedures for enforcement\nactions\n\n\nThe building authority will be able to serve the demolition order\nand either the owner or occupier of the building\n\n\nPreviously it can only serve the owner\n\n\nIt can also order the closure of an unauthorized building\n\n\nThis means the occupiers will have to vacate the place for\ndemolition to proceed\n\n\nThose who fail to comply can be taken to court and made to pay the\nfull cost incurred for removing the structures\n\n<$B> \n\nMr Dhanabalan also moved for a second reading of the\nArchitects Bill and the Professional Engineers Bill\n\n\nHe allow registered architects and professional engineers to team\nup with allied professionals to form multi-discipline partnerships and\nlimited liability companies\n\n\nThe bills have been referred to a Select Committee\n\n\nDuring question time the Senior Minister of State for Foreign\nAffairs Brigadier-General George Yeo told the House the first deployment of\nUS naval and airforce personnel in Singapore begins in March next year\n\n\nSome ninety five of them can be expected on a year-round basis and\na further seventy five on as temporary basis\n\n\nParliaments adjourn to the third of January\n\n\nMore details of the day's proceedings will be telecast in this\nchannel at ten pm\n\n<$A> \n\nSingapore should promote Asian cultures and values with\nconfidence and optimism says the Acting Minister for Information and the Arts\n\n\nBrigadier-General George Yeo says cultural influence follows\neconomic strength and as the economies of Eats and South-East Asia develop so\ntoo will their cultural influence on the rest of the world\n\n<$B> \n\nIn all of history there is a strong link between economic\nperformance and culture and so we see Japanese management culture following\nJapanese capital into America and into Europe and it is Japanese cul\nmanagement culture which will in the end revive many industries in particular\nthe automobile industry in America and in Europe and not far behind Japan are\nthe NIEs and the countries of ASEAN and behind them there is China and there\nis Vietnam\n\n<$A> \n\nGeneral Yeo was speaking at a seminar on the social role of\nSingapore newspapers in promoting Asian cultures and values He said\nSingapore's national debate on cultures and values must be set against the\nlarger historical backdrop of the changing dialogue between East and West and\nwe must avoid self-doubt and pessimism in promoting Asian cultures\n\n<$B> \n\nIf we proceed from an inferiority complex then the likelihood\nis that we will become extreme and we will over-compensate and we will not\nbe rigorous\n\n\nThen we also become petty and narrow-minded and there's no reason\nat all for such pessimism\n\n\nThere's no need for chauvinism of any kind East or West and East\nand West have now to learn from each other\n\n\nOf course <unclear> word </unclear> needn't reminded us that East\nand West have always learnt from each other and from a historical perspective\nwhat we are really seeking is a new synthesis of East and West which raises\nhuman civilization to a higher level\n\n\nSo in the end we must not forget the wise words of Confucius 'si\nhai zhi nei jie xiong ti' that within the four seas all men are brothers\n\n<$A> \n\nComing up in a while\n\n<$B> \n\nThe Economic Development Board says the chemical sector grew\nby fifteen percent last year and its likely to maintain this healthy grow\nrate in nineteen ninety\n\n\nInvestments are expected from European American and Japanese\npharmaceutical and petrochemical firms\n\n\nAs for the light industries such as food and beverages furniture\ntextiles and apparel the EDB expects the sector to improve marginally\nfollowing three years of good growth\n\n\nPrinting and publishing however are likely to grow by ten percent\n\n\nSpokesmen said the light industries depend heavily on the US market\nand with the current slowdown of the American economy those dealing in\nconsumer products will find it tough going\n\n\nThe sector's performance may also be affected by the Gulf crisis\nand the weather now\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd the\n\n<$B> \n\nOccasional showers can be expected tomorrow around mid-day and\nin the afternoon\n\n\nThe temperature should keep between twenty four and thirty one\ndegrees\n\n<$A> \n\nTo end a recap of the main reports the Soviet Foreign Minister\nMr Eduard Shevardnedze has resigned in response to attacks on him and his\nforeign policy\n\n\nThe Select Committee on the elected President Bill is in favour of\npre-qualifying candidates for the post\n\n\nIt also says presidential candidates should not be members of any\npolitical party\n\n\nThe government has announced measures to promote the use of\nunleaded petrol by cars in Singapore\n\n\nThese include a price difference in favour of unleaded petrol\nbeginning in February next year and from July all petrol-dirven vehicles\nimported for use here will have to be able to use unleaded petrol\n\n\nParliament has passed a Building Control Amendment Bill which gives\nthe building authority more power to deal with unauthorized

{"text": "<$A> \n\nThe Japanese then the French and afterwards with the Cambodians\nand the Chinese and of course among themselves\n\n\nIn fact this is the first year of peace in Vietnam for almost half a\ncentury\n\n\nWhen you're so used to war peace can be strange and it's stranger\nstill when you stop to think about what Vietnam is really doing today\n\n\nAfter half a century of fighting and getting rid of foreigners\nVietnam is now asking them back to help it win the peace\n\n\nUnlike before there are now frequent international flights to Hanoi\n\n\nBut before you set foot in Vietnam it's easy to put labels on the\ncountry\n\n\nWe think of Vietnamese as aggressive people\n\n\nHanoi a heart of hard line Marxism and the place so oppressive that\npeople had to flee in boats\n\n\nBut the capital is not like that at all\n\n\nThere may not be many cars but almost everyone owns a bicycle and\nlike many cities there are people and people\n\n\nHard to believe that this is the country of war for decades from\nwhich the boat people fled in such terror\n\n\nToday the Vietnamese are evidently at ease with each other and\nstrangers too\n\n\nEspecially strangers who carry US dollars\n\n\nWe're told that Vietnamese are proud people but pride evidently has\nto take a back seat when the local currency the Dong is practically worthless\n\n\nIf you buy anything in Dong you need a brief case for the notes and\nfor anything expensive this counting machine comes in handy\n\n\nEveryone wants US dollars an irony that leaves the visitor\nwondering how complete Vietnam's victory over the US was\n\n\nAnd for most Vietnamese Ho Chi Min is still the man who liberated\nthe country from American imperialism\n\n\nYet the present leaders are ready to invite the Americans back and\nend the trade embargo impose since the end of the Vietnam war in 1975\n\n\nBut the apparent inconsistency stops here\n\n\nWhen you're finally settle down talk and work with the Vietnamese\nyou'd realise how simple and practical their approach is\n\n\nThere is none of the psychoanalysis or the academy award winning\nmovies of war\n\n\nAt least not yet\n\n\nMore Vietnamese die in the war than all the foreigners combined and\nthe wars were fought on their soil\n\n\nThe warning of the dead continues\n\n\nWith the help of an interpreter we visited the home of a tailor\n\n\nDo Ding Fong has been sewing since he was sixteen\n\n\nToday at sixty he leaves most of it to his son giving him more time\nwith his one hundred year old mother\n\n\nTailoring brings in about four hundred and fifty thousand Dong a\nmonth which is only about forty US dollars\n\n\nIt's difficult to get by especially when he has in-laws staying\nwith him\n\n\nThere is at least enough rice to prepare for everyone\n\n\nHis mother receives twenty-five kilos of rice a month from the\ngovernment\n\n\nShe has lived through all the wars and her son Ding Fong's brother\nwas killed in Dian Bian Fu\n\n\nAnother family and the same philosophical attitude\n\n\nSingapore's senior minister visited Vietnam last month\n\n\nThe way the Vietnamese show their grief he feels has a lot to do\nwith their culture\n\n\nTravelling down from Hanoi to the South and you get the distinct\nfeeling that you're entering modern Vietnam\n\n\nEveryone tells you how fast Ho Chi Min city is developing into a\nbusiness centre the signs that greet you when you arrive confirm it\n\n\nThere is indeed an unrelenting celebration of private enterprise\nhere\n\n\nAnd why not\n\n\nAfter all this was Saigon where people were businessmen by instinct\n\n\nDespite the name change there is still plenty of evidence of the\nold Saigon\n\n\nMany still call the city by its old name\n\n\nVietnam today is a wash with the mood of Doi Moi or renovation\ntheir version of perestroika\n\n\nThe call for reform in the economy started back in the early\neighties although the real turning point came in 1986 when Vietnam swung its\ndoor open to foreigners\n\n\nToday economy liberalisation is not only encouraged it is also\nideologically correct\n\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> is an advisor to the present government\n\n\nA Harvard economist he was acting prime minister of South Vietnam\nbetween 1965 to 66 Vietnam he feels is in a state of transition\n\n\nBut what the politician wants to do sounds good\n\n\nBut what Vietnam is remains very far from what its leaders want it\nto be\n\n\nThese veterans fought for their country in the name of communism\nand nationalism and what's more they won\n\n\nBut the country has made a mess of the peace that followed\n\n\nVietnam is easily one of the poorest countries in the world today\nby every measure from clean water to sewerage to electricity Vietnam has been\nsinking while the rest of Asia has bloomed\n\n\nThe great majority of the population live in acute poverty\nill-housed undernourished and underemployed\n\n\nThe shock of the transition from communism to capitalism\nexacerbated the miseries of the old order\n\n\nThe population is now approaching seventy million people\n\n\nMore than twenty per cent are without full-time employment\n\n\nFor some of them scavenging on the margins of the market fills the\nvital gap between hunger and starvation\n\n\nLenin lingers in Vietnam as a forlorn reminder of what went wrong\n\n\nIn fact it is an irony that this statue still stands while the one\nin Lenin was destroyed when the Soviet Union self-destructed\n\n\nThe disappearance of the Soviet Union and the Eastern block\ncountries had been hard on Vietnam whose economy had relied heavily on Soviet\naid\n\n\nToday with no aid and no Communist markets for Vietnamese exports\nwhat is left is a heavy and unwanted Soviet legacy\n\n\nThis is just one of six hundred similar relics of Soviet\ninspiration clap out equipment and products that can't be sold\n\n\nLike all other heavy industries unless they can turn in a profit by\nthe end of the year they're finished\n\n\nNo more state subsidies\n\n\nThis company is working hard to improve the quality of these piers\nhoping to sell them to Western Europe now that the Communist markets are gone\n\n\nThe managers must learn not only to in turn a profit without\ngovernment help but must begin to pay its workers more and pay taxes to the\nstate\n\n\nOtherwise the private industrialist may take over\n\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> who is now a special advisor to the\nCommunist party's central committee was one of the main advocates of the\nreforms in the eighties\n\n\nHe admits that duplicating the Soviet model has been the main cause\nof the country's failure\n\n\nAnd how long will it take for the Vietnamese to get into the\ncapitalist load of thinking\n\n\nBut not everything from the old order will need to be erased\n\n\nIn fact education under the socialist government has proved to be\nunusually successful\n\n\nToday even when Vietnam compares so miserably with other third\nworld countries in almost everything it is one of the most educated countries\nin the world with more than ninety per cent literacy\n\n\nThis is no mean achievement especially when you consider the\nturmoil war and revolution had caused\n\n\nFor historical and nationalistic reasons the Vietnamese do not like\nbeing too closely with the Chinese\n\n\nBut it's not difficult for the visitors to see Chinese influence in\nVietnam\n\n\nThe buildings their language even their approach to work\n\n\nIn fact the current reforms in Vietnam reflect the changes in China\n\n\nAs far as agriculture is concerned many believe they have taken off\n\n\nIn fact Vietnam has always been a fairly successful agricultural\ncountry until farmers were made to chase the Communist dream\n\n\nPeasants had been forced into collectives\n\n\nPrivate property was outlawed and land owners persecuted\n\n\nThe result while the population grew food production fell\n\n\nIt got to such an alarming point that the collectives had to go\n\n\nBut not fast enough to stave off the threat of mass starvation just\nfour years ago\n\n\nToday these farmers know that the situation can become very bad but\nthey won't starve\n\n\nThey're free to farm on their own account\n\n\nOutput has soared making Vietnam the third largest rice producing\ncountry\n\n\nBeyond that it's clear that there is no quick fix to an economy\nplagued by decades of Communism\n\n\nThe years of waste are clear everywhere for the eye to see and it\ngets worse when you start to get down to the system or in this case the lack\nof it\n\n\nPeople say it's a lot better today but the infrastructure is still\ndesperately inadequate\n\n\nElectricity could go off for up to four days\n\n\nRoads are few and built mainly for bicycles\n\n\nDespite the liberal foreign investment laws the bureaucracy can be\nmaddening\n\n\nIt's a place for business only if you're very patient\n\n\nAnd there are no real banking or legal supports in the way modern\nbusinessmen are used to\n\n\nMr <unclear> word </unclear> works for a foreign company in Ho Chi\nMin city\n\n\nHe knows the problems only too well\n\n\nWhen everything came down from the top controls had been crucial\n\n\nNow that the economy is moving away from that the cracks are\nbeginning to show\n\n\nThe man in the street may be able to do his bit for private\nenterprise by selling whatever he has for a profit\n\n\nBut to overhaul the entire system into an outward looking business\nentity it's altogether a different matter\n\n\nThere simply aren't the right people with the right knowledge at\nthe middle and top to carry this out\n\n\nThis is where the foreigners must come in in a big way\n\n\nTwo years ago Vietnam opened the world's first floating hotel\n\n\nIt remains the only five star hotel in Ho Chi Min city\n\n\nBut it's a start in getting foreign expertise and hard tourist\ndollars in\n\n\nThe service industry is only one example of investors testing the\nwaters\n\n\nMore substantially the cheap labour and rich resources such as oil\nand gas are attracting the Taiwanese Koreans and other Asian investors in big\nair loads by the day\n\n\nThat Vietnam is virgin territory with a big potential market is\njust one reason for them to take the plunge\n\n\nFor many Asians and Western investors Vietnam has become part of\ntheir Asian diversification plan\n\n\nKeppel shipyard in Singapore was one of the earliest pioneers\n\n\nBack in the mid-eighties they negotiated contracts with not just\nthe Vietnamese but there Soviet advisors as well\n\n\nToday Keppel is in Vietnam providing infrastructural support from\nequipment for oil rigging shipyards and even backing support\n\n\nWhat Vietnam needs is clear\n\n\nIdeas and money to do things and to do them differently\n\n\nOld ideas have proved useless and old friends are now gone\n\n\nThe new friends are more important\n\n\nThey're richer and the new ties do not come with political\nconditions\n\n\nIt's strictly business\n\n\nBut how would the Vietnamese best use these ideas and money\n\n\nThis exchange of expertise is starting within Vietnam\n\n\nBut with changes there would be other areas that the government\nwould need to look into\n\n\nWhen almost everything is up for grabs you can encourage the wrong\ntypes in those interested only in a quick buck leaving the Vietnamese to pick\nup the crumbs\n\n\nLike all third world countries in a haste to modernise the social\neffects may not always be easy to control\n\n\nIn 1986 the government allowed youngsters into dance halls\n\n\nIt might have been against the socialist way of life but it\nreduced the crime rate\n\n\nToday this is a common sight in Ho Chi Min city\n\n\nAnd the clubs have introduced other acts to lure their guests back\n\n\nSome of these acts can get just a little hot\n\n\nBy Bangkok standards this may seem tame\n\n\nIn Ho Chi Min city it's a walk on the wild side\n\n\nAnd it gets wilder and wilder when you know where to look\n\n\nAnd it's only at the beginning\n\n\nThe invasion of the foreigners hasn't happen in a big way\n\n\nWhen the US embargo was finally lifted Vietnam can expect more\ninvestors and more social change \n\n\nBut for now Washington's seventeen year old embargo on trade and\naid to Vietnam has an effect place the country off limits not only to the US\nbut its powerful allies as well", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "b81bfc87-e821-431e-b702-0e5b48985258",

{"text": "<$A> \n\nWe are in for some very tough times\n\n\nThe currency crisis started in Thailand in July last year\n\n\nIt then spread quickly to the rest of the region\n\n\nIn some countries the financial and economic problems triggered off\nsocial and political upheavals\n\n\nThe turmoil has gone on for more than a year now but the end is\nstill not in sight\n\n\nMatters are likely to get worse before they get better\n\n\nWe must prepare ourselves for a gloomy scenario\n\n\nContinued difficulties in the region will mean minimal growth for\nSingapore over the next 1 to 2 years\n\n\nWe need to be realistic about the prospects\n\n\nBut there is no reason to be despondent\n\n\nWe have the resources and resolve to withstand the external shocks\n\n\nWe do not have the weaknesses of the badly affected economies\n\n\nBut we need to organise ourselves to weather the storm and use this\nperiod to gain a head start for the race ahead after the storm has subsided\n\n\nSteering through this storm to safety is Singapore's biggest\nchallenge since I became Prime Minister eight years ago\n\n\nFortunately I have a capable and steady team of ministers permanent\nsecretaries and senior civil servants\n\n\nBut they cannot do this job by themselves\n\n\nThey need your co-operation and support to succeed\n\n\n Genesis of the regional crisis \n\n\nLet me go back to how the regional crisis started and how we got\nsucked in\n\n\n Thailand \n\n\nThailand was one of the new economic tigers\n\n\nLast year in June when I visited Thailand the signs of trouble were\nthere though they were not yet obvious\n\n\nI saw scores of magnificent new buildings many unoccupied in\nBangkok\n\n\nThere were large tracts of newly-prepared but vacant industrial\nsites at the Eastern Seaboard\n\n\nThe Thai baht had run into trouble in May\n\n\nThe ministers could not agree on how to handle the problem\n\n\nOn the last day of my visit Prime Minister Chavalit hosted me to a\ngolf game along with his Finance Minister Amnuay Virawan\n\n\nDuring the game Chavalit whispered to me that he was trying to\npersuade Amnuay not to resign\n\n\nLater I spoke to Amnuay\n\n\nHe confirmed that it was true\n\n\nHe had held back his announcement out of courtesy to me\n\n\nImmediately after the golf game\n\n\nAmnuay met the press to announce his resignation\n\n\nThai companies had borrowed too much in US dollars\n\n\nThey spent the money on property projects which earned Thai baht\nnot US dollars\n\n\nThis was all right provided the projects were sound and the baht\nexchange rate was stable\n\n\nUnfortunately both assumptions turned out to be wrong\n\n\nMany of the projects were not sound\n\n\nThe property boom had become a dangerous bubble\n\n\nThai banking supervision was weak\n\n\nNobody stopped banks and finance companies from risky lending\n\n\nIn fact many lent to their owners relatives and friends\n\n\nAs the Thai economy weakened the baht became over-valued\n\n\nFund managers and currency speculators saw an opportunity\n\n\nThey bet that the baht would go down and sold the baht short\n\n\nThe Bank of Thailand spent US$20 billion in a futile attempt to\ndefend the Thai baht\n\n\nEventually it ran out of US dollars and gave up\n\n\nThe Thai baht immediately depreciated by 17 percent to 29 baht per\nUS dollar\n\n\nToday the Thai baht is 42 baht to one US dollar down by 42 per cent\n\n\nWhen the baht fell companies which could not pay back the US\ndollars went bust\n\n\nForeign lenders recalled their loans\n\n\nThai banks and finance companies were left with huge amounts of bad\ndebt and became insolvent\n\n\nThe whole financial system was shaken\n\n\nThe economy almost collapsed Thailand had no choice but to call in\nthe IMF\n\n\n Contagion \n\n\nThe Thai collapse scared investors and bankers who had invested or\nlent money in Indonesia South Korea and Malaysia\n\n\nThey rushed to pull back loans and investments\n\n\nThe rupiah won and ringgit went down like the baht\n\n\nTheir economies came to a sudden halt\n\n\nMalaysia did not have huge foreign debts but its domestic debt was\nlarge nearly twice its GDP\n\n\nMany foreign investors had invested in Malaysian shares\n\n\nWhen they lost confidence in Malaysia and sold the shares the Kuala\nLumpur Stock Exchange crashed\n\n\nMany companies had borrowed heavily from banks against their shares\n\n\nTheir collateral was reduced to a fraction of the value they had\npledged to the banks\n\n\nThe companies became insolvent The banks' non-performing loans went\nup dangerously high\n\n\nSingapore companies on the whole have not borrowed excessively\nwhether in US dollars or Singapore dollars\n\n\nOur banking system is sound\n\n\nBut the Singapore dollar also went down against the US dollar\nalthough by less\n\n\nOur economy is so interlinked with our neighbours that their\nproblems inevitably affect us\n\n\nWhen Latin America was hit by a financial crisis in 1994 investment\nanalysts called it the \" tequila\" shock\n\n\nThat crisis had originated from Mexico well known for its punchy\ntequila\n\n\nFor the Asian crisis they called the contagion the \" tom-yam\"\neffect\n\n\nBut the tom-yam soup was very spicy\n\n\nUnlike the tequila hangover which went away after one year the\ntom-yam effect has remained\n\n\nNow some call the crisis an Asian flu\n\n\nBut the strain is apparently resistant to the antibiotics\nprescribed by the IMF\n\n\n Indonesia \n\n\nWhat has happened in Indonesia is a major tragedy\n\n\nThe rupiah today is worth only one-fifth of what it was against the\nUS dollar last June\n\n\nThe banking system has almost collapsed\n\n\nThe economy is expected to contract by 15% this year\n\n\n90 million Indonesians nearly half the population are living below\nthe poverty line that is on less than S$30 a month\n\n\n40 million face the threat of starvation\n\n\nThe May riots will put Indonesia back by many years\n\n\nThe Indonesian Chinese minority community bore the brunt of the\nviolence\n\n\nMedia reports have drawn international attention to what happened\n\n\nHundreds of internet websites are carrying \" yellow ribbons\" to\ndemand justice for the victims of what is widely believed to be organised\nlawlessness\n\n\nMany Indonesian Chinese and foreigners fled Indonesia in terror\n\n\nSome have not returned\n\n\nOthers went back only to salvage what was left of their businesses\nbut not to rebuild or re-invest\n\n\nTVRI showed retailers selling their wares outside burnt-out shops\n\n\n Wong Kwei Cheong's Story \n\n\nThe Indonesian tragedy struck home vividly when I learnt of what\nhappened to Wong Kwei Cheong our former MP for Cairnhill\n\n\nAfter leaving NUS he poured his energy and capital into investments\nin Indonesia\n\n\nHe started several factories in Indonesia with a Japanese partner\nto produce TVs video cassette players and other electronic goods\n\n\nHe did well and built up a chain of distributors\n\n\nLike most companies he borrowed foreign currency to finance his\ninvestments in Indonesia\n\n\nHis products were sold in Indonesia\n\n\nHe borrowed at about 2 500 rupiah per US dollar\n\n\nAt 5 000 rupiah he could still survive\n\n\nBut beyond that it was impossible\n\n\nHis distributors owed him money\n\n\nThey could not repay and offered to do so with their shops\n\n\nI advised Wong Kwei Cheong against taking over the shops\n\n\nI told him \" You will lose them there will be social unrest\"\n\n\nThat was in February\n\n\nHe said that he had no choice\n\n\nAlso he intended to build up his own chain of shops to distribute\nhis products\n\n\nUnfortunately I was right\n\n\nMany of his shops were looted and burnt\n\n\nHe has suffered a severe setback but he will bounce back\n\n\nI have confidence in him\n\n\n A Singaporean Victim \n\n\nI also received a letter from a 65 year old retiree recounting how\na close relative a Singaporean suffered the same fate during the Jakarta May\nriots\n\n\nHis relative a young entrepreneur had built up a sizeable food\ndistribution business in Jakarta \" after tears and sweat for five years\" as\nhe put it\n\n\nOn 14 May his relative's two super-markets two coffee houses a\nbakery two warehouses an expensive \" cold room\" three freezer trucks and a\ncar were looted and set on fire\n\n\nHis home was also broken into and stripped of its contents\n\n\nThe retiree wanted the Government to know that there were\nSingaporean victims of the May riots and that charity should begin at home\n\n\n Helping Indonesia \n\n\nI feared the worst for Indonesia when the crisis started\n\n\nThat is why I visited then President Suharto three times\n\n\nI also spoke to President Clinton Prime Minister Hashimoto Prime\nMinister John Howard and Chancellor Kohl\n\n\nI impressed upon them the seriousness of the Indonesian situation\nand urged them to help\n\n\nWe tried but alas we failed\n\n\nAll of us pinned hope on the IMF solution in restoring investor\nconfidence in Indonesia\n\n\nOn hindsight we should have tried harder to get President Suharto\nto understand that signing the Letter of Intent with IMF was only the first\nstep and that results would show only 6 to 12 months after he had fully\nimplemented the IMF conditions\n\n\nSenior Minister and I knew that President Suharto was not happy\nwith some of the IMF measures\n\n\nWe suggested that he appoint Paul Volcker as his adviser to\nintervene with the IMF\n\n\nPaul Volcker is a former Chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board\nwith a formidable reputation\n\n\nHe would have had the standing to argue against the IMF\n\n\nThe IMF would not lightly dismiss Volcker's views nor would the\nmarket lose confidence if Indonesia followed Volcker's advice instead of the\nIMF's\n\n\nPaul Volcker was approached\n\n\nHe visited Indonesia but decided not to take up the appointment\n\n\nHe must have found the task of helping Indonesia too difficult\ngiven the government's policies at that time\n\n\nWe have a vested interest in Indonesia's stability growth and\nprosperity\n\n\nIt is our close neighbour and a major trading partner\n\n\nWe have more than S$4 billion of investments in Indonesia\n\n\nIn Batam Bintan Karimun Sumatra Java and elsewhere\n\n\nOur banks have another S$4 billion in loans to Indonesia\n\n\nAn Indonesian collapse will hurt us besides scaring off\ninvestments from the wider region\n\n\nSingapore will help Indonesia within the limits of our ability\n\n\nWe are a small economy\n\n\nOur GDP  is a mere 1% of the United States GDP  and 2% of Japan's GDP <&>  US$4190 billion)\n\n\nIt is only one fifth of Australia's GDP <&>  US$395 billion)\n\n\nWe are not in the same class\n\n\nAfter all we are only three million people\n\n\nJust a little red dot on the map\n\n\nWhere is the capacity to help 211 million people\n\n\nWhatever we do within our means it should make some real\ndifference to Indonesia\n\n\nWe pledged US$5 billion to help Indonesia along with the IMF in\nNovember last year to show confidence in Indonesia\n\n\nMAS also participated in joint intervention to support the rupiah\nexchange rate\n\n\nUnfortunately the intervention was overtaken by events and failed\n\n\nWe still have several trillion rupiah deposited with Bank\nIndonesia\n\n\n The Trade Guarantee Scheme \n\n\nSingapore is giving humanitarian assistance to Indonesia\n\n\nBeyond that our best and most practical contribution now is not to\nfinance Indonesia's budget deficit or food subsidies through the IMF\n\n\nBut to help Indonesia restart a part of its economy which has\nstalled\n\n\nForeign banks have stopped accepting Letters of Credit issued by\nIndonesian banks\n\n\nWe tried to help with a guarantee scheme\n\n\nWe sought the support of Indonesia's major trading partners for a\nUS$20 billion Multilateral Trade Finance Guarantee Scheme\n\n\nI wrote to leaders of the G7 plus a few other countries\n\n\nFrom their replies it was clear that most preferred to have their\nown bilateral schemes and be in full control of their own funds\n\n\nAt the request of then President Suharto and his Economic\nMinisters Singapore subsequently offered its own Bilateral Trade Finance\nGuarantee Scheme  to Indonesia using the US$5 billion pledged under\nthe second line financing package with the IMF\n\n\nWe put up our proposal to Indonesia Officials from both sides held\none meeting in April\n\n\nThe Indonesians took the proposal back to study\n\n\nThey commented that the scheme had too many safeguards\n\n\nSingapore has no experience at all in trade finance guarantee\nschemes\n\n\nSafeguards are necessary to prevent unscrupulous traders from\nabusing the scheme through fraud and cheating \n\n\nThis would not only defeat our objective but harm the reputation\nof the scheme and further erode confidence in Indonesia We are taking advice\nfrom experienced international institutions like the World Bank or the Exim\nbanks of the big exporting countries to learn how to improve on our proposals\nwithout losing discipline and control Guaranteeing trade transactions in an\nunstable environment is a risky business The Indonesian newspapers recently\nreported that a syndicate of 12 Indonesian banks had been cheated of US$18\nmillion in a trade financing scam The banks only discovered that the imports\nwere fictitious when the company concerned failed to make payment", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nThis is where public housing is going in the future Sin Ming\nCourt Bishan West\n\n\nWith its distinctive <unclear> word </unclear> walls and roofs Sin\nMing Court offers one of the latest designs in HDB public housing\n\n\nFor the Housing and Development Board it will need upgrading more\nthan of the six hundred thousand flats all over Singapore over the next ten\nto fifteen\n\n\nIn the 1960s the HDB launched it called its home for the people\nscheme\n\n\nToday with most Singaporeans owning HDB flats housing is no longer\nan urgent problem\n\n\nInstead many are eager to upgrade into bigger and better flats\n\n\nAbout half of applications for recently built flats are existing HDB\nflat owners\n\n\nTo help residents to become comfortable and familiar with their\nsurroundings to stay put instead of moving out into a new neighbourhood and\ncommunity the government's introduced a programme in 1989 to upgrade older\nhousing estates to about the same standards found in the newer estates\n\n\nThe upgrading exercise is one of the most farreaching measures in\npublic housing\n\n\nSally <unclear> word </unclear> and her husband Ricky moved into\nthis new estate in Hougang from Whampoa\n\n\nA distinct feature in the new estate is that a few blocks of\nbetween three and eight are grouped together called a precinct\n\n\nEach precinct is marked by artificial boundaries such as link ways\n\n\nThis organisation of precincts will be phased into older estates\nunder the upgrading programme\n\n\nIt's designed to give residents privacy and that extra sense of\nbelonging\n\n\nTo ensure wider choices and variety in design private architects\nwill be invited to take part\n\n\nSix precincts have been selected and will be upgraded within the\nnext two years to show just how the programme can make improvements\n\n\nThese demonstration precincts are Ang Mo Kio neighbourhood three\nanother at the Marine Parade estate Lorong Lew Lian and Telok Blangah\n\n\nEach will have its own demonstrations with the other show precincts\nat Clementi and Kim Keat\n\n\nThey spread all over Singapore so other HDB owners can easily get\nto them\n\n\nIn these precincts dialogue sessions have been held since the\nconcept was introduced\n\n\nTowards this end the government works closely with grassroots\nleaders and twon council members\n\n\nParticipation in the project is voluntary\n\n\nThe demonstration project is expected to be launched sometime this\nyear\n\n\nHowever the majority that is at least seventy-five per cent of\nowners in the precinct must be in favour of the proposals before the project\ncan proceed\n\n\nResidents in the each precinct can provide feedback on the type of\nchanges they want through their grassroots leaders and town council members\n\n\nUpgrading of older flats is a new concept in Singapore\n\n\nHowever its been introduced in other countries with a large number\nof old buildings\n\n\nThe HDB has been studying the upgrading programmes in Japan and\nFrance\n\n\nThe improved environment as a result of upgrading is expected to\nbring about a more cohesive and caring community\n\n\nBut how does it work\n\n\nWe'll take a look at the new estate of Bishan\n\n\nAs in many other new estates most people in Bishan East come from\nolder ones all over Singapore\n\n\nHere they build a new life\n\n\nThe focal point of their many recreational activities is the part\nin the centre of the precinct\n\n\nAll the amenities the playground multi-purpose court and landscape\ngardens have been integrated into the park\n\n\nEileen Lim moved her home to Bishan with her parents four years ago\n\n\nEileen's a student in Canada but now on vacation in Singapore\n\n\nFor Eileen there's a feeling of home despite there being about\ntwenty thousand flats in the estate\n\n\nPerhaps the fact that the estate's broken up into smaller areas\nhelps to build a sense of belonging among residents\n\n\nThe open area used in many older estates for parking cars here\nbecomes a garden\n\n\nThe different themes of the estate lend distinction and contrast to\nother areas like Bishan North identified for its different perspectives\ncolours and design or Bishan West better known as Sim Ming Court\n\n\nCome evening the neighbourhood comes alive with its own activities\n\n\nFor Chandran meeting his children at the playground has almost\nbecome a daily ritual\n\n\nEvery Tuesday night residents meet at the basketball court to get\nto know one another better\n\n\nThat's aside from the entertainment\n\n\nOn other nights they go ballroom dancing or their children practice\nTae Kwan Do\n\n\nLike Chandran many people feel a growing sense of pride in Bishan\n\n\nThe upgrading of older estates will give residents greater\nopportunity better amenities and a higher standard of living\n\n\nAs in Bishan it will nurture that sense of pride so that residents\nwill refrain from littering and vandalising their own property\n\n\nChief architect Tony Tan and three other HDB architects work for\nthe upgrading of Kim Keat Lorong Lew Lian and Ang Mo Kio while the other\nthree precincts Marine Parade Telok Blangah and Clementi will be designed by\nprivate architects\n\n\nFor all the six precincts the resident gets a package of benefits\n\n\nThere are three components in the package\n\n\nWithin the flat there will be an additional space of about six\nsquare metres\n\n\nIt may be a utility space a service balcony at the kitchen or a\nfront balcony\n\n\nAnd then conversion of window frames to aluminum type\n\n\nFor those who already made changes there'll be improvement work on\nthe fittings and fixtures such as internal doors or refuse chute hoppers with\nself-locking devices\n\n\nThe upgrading programme can help flat owners many of whom have\nalready renovated their flats to improve their surrounding making better use\nof common areas such as a surface carpark and void decks\n\n\nIn a meeting between the town council the HDB and the architect\nwith residents of Marine Parade Prime Minster Goh Chok Tong he's also an MP\nfor the Marine Parade GRC said the improved environment is expected to\nincrease their network of older estates\n\n\nTo ensure that the project runs smoothly the HDB launched a pilot\nprogramme early last year\n\n\nThe Board's to refurbish several big blocks of flats at Teban\nGardens and Woodlands\n\n\nNo one will need to move out of his flat during the refurbishing\nperiod which is expected to be about two to two and a half years\n\n\nInstead of hacking the existing structure the dry technique and\nprecost method will be used as much as possible in order to reduce nuisance\nlevel\n\n\nHow much one can endure the noise dust discomfort as well as the\nsafety and security aspects are being carefully monitored and studied by the\nHDB\n\n\nFeedback from occupants of flats under this pilot programme is\nconstantly sought in order to help the HDB keep inconveniences to the minimum\n\n\nAt the same time visits to newer estates such as Pasir Ris has been\norganised by the HDB in order to make the plan clear to residents in the\ndemonstration precincts\n\n\nThey were shown features that could be incorporated under the\nupgrading programme which indeed have already been introduced here\n\n\nIn the meantime residents committee members have been actively\ncarrying out surveys among residents in the identified demonstration\nprecincts\n\n\nThe idea is to ensure that at least seventy-five per cent accept\nthe proposals of their architect and town councils\n\n\nFor those who may find it difficult to join the programme due to\nfinancial constraints there's a loan scheme to help them\n\n\nThe cost of upgrading each flat is about forty-five thousand\ndollars which includes provision for future fluctuations in material cost and\ninflation\n\n\nFor the demonstration projects the government will finance ninety\nper cent while owners pay only ten per cent\n\n\nPublic support is vital for the success of the upgrading programme\n\n\nWith rising expectations among Singaporeans there'll be changes in\nlifestyle\n\n\nWe spoke to those living in the precincts identified for the\ndemonstration project\n\n\nThe new look that comes with the upgrading programme will be\ndisplayed in special exhibitions to be held at the six demonstration\nprecincts\n\n\nResidents will have opportunities to examine the proposed upgrading\npackages for their precincts\n\n\nThe HDB will lead in the upgrading exercise of these older estates\n\n\nBut it will be the owner flats together with their town councilors\nand grassroots leaders to determine their surroundings a Singapore transforms\nitself into a modern city state \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nFor the Indians Gandhi stands as a symbol for many things\n\n\nAnd among the tenets of Gandhi philosophy is the belief that\neducation is a great leveler in society\n\n\nIs a belief that Mister Isheran <unclear> word </unclear> would\nlike to instill in Indian Singaporeans\n\n\nHe spearheads the SINDA task force that wants to change the\ndropping educational standards among Indian Singaporeans\n\n\nThe challenge that SINDA faces is to close the educational gap\nbetween the Chinese and Indians by the year twenty ten Fortunately SINDA has\nfound ready support among in the Indian community The president of\n\n\nSINDA Mister J Y Pilay told Friday Background why this is so\nnecessary\n\n\nSome Indian Singaporeans seem to have lost the drive to excel\n\n\nInstead they're satisfied with minimum education and low-paying\njobs\n\n\nThis attitude is seen in one particular social strata more than the\nothers\n\n\nNot surprisingly then the performance of Indian students is lagging\nbehind the national average\n\n\nOn in four Indian students will drop out before getting a PSLE\ncertificate\n\n\nOnly twenty-eight per cent of Indian students taking the 'O' levels\nqualify for JC\n\n\nAmong the Chinese forty per cent of those taking the 'O' levels\nwill enter JC and only twenty per cent of Indian students taking the 'A'\nlevels will enter universities or polytechnics\n\n\nThe better educated are taking the lead in pulling up the\neducational standards of the community\n\n\nLess than six months since it began working on this goal SINDA has\na number of projects in full swing and the office is a hype of activity\n\n\nMister Tegeraj <unclear> word </unclear> as operations manager has\nhis hands full making sure everything is running smoothly\n\n\nHe works closely with Suma the coordinator of the tuition programme\nwhich started in January\n\n\nAlthough they both started here as volunteers their interest in\nSINDA led to them staying on as full-time staff\n\n\nBut SINDA can't live on enthusiasm alone\n\n\nThey need three point seven five million to run their education\nprojects\n\n\nNow with the amendment to the CPF bill past last week SINDA will be\nable to collect money through a monthly contribution from all Indian\nemployees\n\n\nEmployers will automatically deduct employees contributions from\ntheir salaries\n\n\nThese are the minimum rates that have been agreed on\n\n\nAn opting out scheme for those who don't want to contribute has\nbeen worked out\n\n\nThis puts the pressure on giving and it's something which could\nlead to negative response among some\n\n\nBut Mister Ishweran who worked on the details of the amended bill\nfeels that this will not be too much of a problem\n\n\nSINDA's latest and most extensive projects so far are these\ntuition classes\n\n\nScience and Maths have been identified as areas of weakness for\nmany Indian students\n\n\nSo along with English these subjects are taught three times a week\nby qualified teachers using materials from the Ministry of Education\n\n\nIt's only been five weeks but already the effects can be seen\n\n\nIn tuition hungry Singapore the response has been overwhelming\nespecially when classes cost only twenty-five dollars per month\n\n\nSo far two thousand four hundred students are enrolled in these\nclasses\n\n\nBut by keeping the classes to fifteen students SINDA teachers have\nbeen able to give more individual attention to each pupil\n\n\nIt's this individual attention that Haridas like about SINDA's\ntuition classes\n\n\nHe's not really a bad student but for the last year he's not been\ndoing well in Mathematics\n\n\nNow with the extra help he's getting at these tuition classes he\nfeels that he's improved and that this year's results might be better\n\n\nAnd if there's no tuition class it's home to a session with mum\n\n\nMrs Shanta more than willing to spend her time studying with her\nson because she believes very strongly that parents are instrumental in how\nwell their children do in school \n\n\nSINDA knows that fighting for the future cannot be done without\nhelp from the parents Children who learn the importance of education and\nknowledge from a young age will be more motivated to do well An through their\nparent outreach programme SINDA's trying to make sure that this happens With\nthe formation of groups like SINDA the beginning to turn more to community\nself-help in order to right what is wrong As those who have succeed reach out\nto the less well off in the community perhaps there will come a time

{"text": "<$A> \n\nAlvin is seventeen\n\n\nHe used to cycle out even if it were very late whenever he had\nproblems with his parents\n\n\nFive years ago Alvin was sent to Boys' Town\n\n\nHis parents felt that they'd lost total control over their son\n\n\nAnd this boy felt the same way too\n\n\nAfter Damian's father passed away four years ago it became difficult\nfor his mother to keep track of his activities\n\n\nHe used to come back at odd hours\n\n\nToday Damian comes back only on alternate weekends\n\n\nThe rest of his time is spent at Boys' Town\n\n\nHe's been there for ten months now\n\n\nOne reason for this problem is that not enough time is spent with\nthe children\n\n\nBut then there's little choice\n\n\nMoney needs to be earned and food needs to be put on the table\n\n\nAbout nine in ten of the kids at these homes come from lower income\nor single-parent families\n\n\nWith the extended family becoming less common today it's meant that\nwhile parents are out working the child is left to his own devices\n\n\nMany may not have taken a wrong turn but some have\n\n\nLeft alone they're free to do whatever they want with whomever they\nwant\n\n\nMany parents have lost control and in desperation have put their\nchildren into homes like Boys' Town\n\n\nThey hope that the change of environment and a more structured\nlifestyle will instill discipline and councilors like Irene Loy see to that\nbut not in the way many people expect\n\n\nThere's no unnecessary caning or severe punishment\n\n\nAnd discipline means following a fixed schedule for meals study\ngames and housekeeping\n\n\nIt's rise and shine at 0640 hours and lights out at 2200 hrs\n\n\nBut discipline alone isn't enough to smoothen the rough edges\n\n\nThese boys need practical skills and a sound education to give them\na boost when they leave Boys' Town\n\n\nThirty of the seventy-six boarders learn a trade at Boys' Town\nVocational Institute\n\n\nThe remaining forty-six attend Assumption English School which's\nnext door and study with a thousand others students\n\n\nBut how do these students feel about their classmates from Boys'\nTown\n\n\nBut unfortunately acceptance remains confine to those who study\nteach and play with the boys\n\n\nTo study together to share their problems thoughts and hopes this\nis what the home has come to mean for these boys\n\n\nSo after a while being there doesn't seem so bad\n\n\nThere's a feeling that there're all in it together\n\n\nAnd change is also a key word at the Haven\n\n\nThis home run by the Salvation Army takes in children from families\nwith problems\n\n\nBut they're younger between ten to thirteen years\n\n\nTo protect them from prejudices we're even told not to show their\nfaces\n\n\nThe Haven hopes that by reaching them at such a tender age the\nchild will be able to escape a vicious circle of problem families\n\n\nJohn Nickelson has been a social worker for over thirty years now\nand he gave producer Silvan Poi his views\n\n\nSo the approach is that residential care should only be the last\nresort\n\n\nBut sadly there are parents who have pushed the responsibility to\nthe home saying that it can take better care of their child\n\n\nAnd that's where the Teen Challenge Crisis Care can help\n\n\nThe home services are temporary shelter for troubled teens many who\nare runaways\n\n\nAnd that's the aim for all these homes\n\n\nThe eventual reconciliation of the family unit\n\n\nAlthough not all cases are success stories those that do make it\nare much better for the experience\n\n\nAfter five years Alvin's relationship with his parents is much\nbetter\n\n\nNow he can talk to them\n\n\nIt's also his last year in Boy's Town and his outlook on life is\nclearer\n\n\nHe wants to go to the Temasek Polytechnic to study graphics\n\n\nSo how does he feel about Boys' Town now\n\n\nSo there is hope\n\n\nFor Damien he's just beginning to feel the change in himself\n\n\nBeing at Boys' Town only ten month he still got some ways to go\n\n\nBut he is more tolerant of his mother now and he's finding out that\nthere's more to life than just doing what he wants to do \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nFour times a week for the last three years David Wee has been\nattending a private law school\n\n\nHe's a full-time student and will be taking his exams this June\n\n\nIt hasn't been easy studying law on his own but then David didn't\nhave much of a choice\n\n\nAnd going abroad was out of the question\n\n\nLike David almost half his classmates are striving towards the same\ngoal to be a lawyer\n\n\nBut for various reasons they're not doing it the usual way through\nthe university\n\n\nAll are however serious about achieving their dream\n\n\nBut it's an uphill struggle for them for some are able to do it\nfull-time many aren't as fortunate\n\n\nPeter Ong is one such person\n\n\nHe's a second year external law student from another private school\n\n\nBut time is a luxury they can't afford\n\n\nThe external degree they're working for now is recognised only up\ntill nineteen ninety-six for admission to the bar which is what qualifies\nthem as a lawyer\n\n\nAfter nineteen ninety-six too bad\n\n\nA law degree yes but no hope of actually becoming a lawyer\n\n\nIn the report published by the committee for the supply of lawyers\nthe members said we do not accept that the holder of the external degree is\ncomparable to the holder of a LLB NUS degree\n\n\nAnd the reason for this they feel that external students aren't in\nuniversity because of their lower A level qualifications\n\n\nAnd because they aren't in university they wouldn't have benefited\nfrom what the committee calls an intellectual environment which conduces to a\ndeeper and better understanding of the law and its role in society\n\n\nIn other words the committee believes that because external\nstudents did not go to a proper school they won't make good lawyers\n\n\nAnd the course David sought isn't that much different from what\nstudents in UK universities are doing\n\n\nIn fact it's the external programme conducted by the University of\nLondon\n\n\nIt's a three year course with exams at the end of each year\n\n\nThe only difference external students can study at their own pace\nand only sit for each exam when they feel ready\n\n\nSo they can take anything from three to eight years to get a degree\n\n\nBut even so the exams they take will still have to meet certain\nstandards\n\n\nS Kunalan a former external law student has a Masters degree with\ndistinction from the University of London and he's been teaching external law\nstudents for eight years\n\n\nAnother words the university expects the same standard from both\nits internal and external students\n\n\nThat's not all\n\n\nPassing the basic degree exam is one thing but it doesn't qualify\nthem as a lawyer\n\n\nThey still have to sit for the English bar exam\n\n\nAnd this they can't do if they get anything less than a second\nclass lower Honours\n\n\nAnd to make things harder the pass rate at English bar is less than\nthirty per cent\n\n\nChandran Mohanair is a partner in a law firm and Vice-President of\nthe Law Society\n\n\nHe agrees universities can produce good law graduates but more is\nrequired\n\n\nWhether or not external law students are of lower calibre than\nuniversity students is debatable\n\n\nBut what's clear however is this\n\n\nExternal law students have to pass a basic degree exam which is\nsimilar to that taken by UK students and all of them also have to pass the\nsame bar exam\n\n\nSo surely there's no reason to assume that every external law\ndegree holder is inferior\n\n\nAnd what's more to carry that assumption so far as to deny them the\nchance to prove themselves\n\n\nClasses may be over for the day for these students\n\n\nBut for David that only means it's revision time after all he has a\ndeadline to beat \n\n\n\n<$C> \n\nEstablished one hundred and seven years ago ACS the best is\nyet to be striving towards an all-round education reaching the mind the heart\nand even the soul\n\n\nEvery aspect of the school is planned and built towards making sure\nthat the boys are given the most and the best right down to little details\nthat make school feel like home\n\n\nEach student pays two hundred dollars a month which sure helps a\nlot in getting the school on its feet and going\n\n\nThe school has an administrative staff of seven clerks four\nsecretaries one bursar two vice-principals and one principal\n\n\nAll to manage the massive paper work logistics and plans necessary\nto keep the school in fighting shape\n\n\nAnd this is certainly a relief I'm sure to the teachers some one\nhundred and twenty-eight of them who can now at least concentrate on what\nthey do best\n\n\nAnd most of these teachers are graduates hand picked by the\nprincipal himself\n\n\nI dropped in a class of boys revising for a geography exam\n\n\nThis ratio of one teacher to fifteen students certainly makes\nteaching and learning a different experience all together\n\n\nAnd you wonder where are the exercise books\n\n\nIn this set up each student gets individual attention\n\n\nAnd it's refreshing to see how on the spot learning of mistakes\ntake place\n\n\nAlso the students learn how to interact with each other all within\nthe cool and conducive environment\n\n\nIt means <unclear> word </unclear> whole culture or group sharing\nand learning is simply a way of life in the school\n\n\nBeauty and the beast\n\n\nNow this secondary four class was learning reading and\ncomprehension skills in a fun well funny way\n\n\nSo each class at whichever level is the same yet different because\nteacher and pupil are allowed to experiment and come up with new ideas from\nwhatever way so long as learning takes place\n\n\nYes a lesson in stress management for these fourteen year olds and\nthe boys tell it all\n\n\nThis is all part of a pastoral care programme that looks after the\nboys' emotional needs\n\n\nIt also prepares them to face the world like an adult and confront\nproblems with each other\n\n\nAnd who wouldn't be able to build up his confidence if you've to\nstand in front of your friends just about everyday in almost every class\n\n\nThe essence of education the molding of each student's character\nand what better way than through enrichment programmes so that he finds\nwithin himself something he likes something he knows is uniquely his\nsomething to show the world who he is\n\n\nAnd the chance to create and be spurred on to do even better\n\n\nSo after almost one year of teething problems ACS not unlike the\nother seven independent schools has began to start a standard of education\nwhich I believe is going to be a tough act to follow\n\n\nSimply because of its whole support system in terms of its funding\nalumni teaching and non-teaching staff\n\n\nAlso the school has complete freedom to plan and chart each\nstudent's future\n\n\nNow all these things are absolutely crucial in ensuring the\nschool's strength and success\n\n\nSo can autonomous schools match up\n\n\nWell so far details released by the education ministry on\nautonomous schools show that they'll remain as either government or aided\nschools\n\n\nFunding the government will give them seven hundred thousand\ndollars more for an enrolment of fifteen hundred students\n\n\nThis is to help them introduce new enrichment programmes\n\n\nSchool fees will be between fifteen dollars and thirty-two dollars\n\n\nTeachers will still come under the ministry but principals will\nhave more say in selecting who they want on their staff\n\n\nThey can also hire new staff for enrichment programmes and support\nservices\n\n\nAnd as far as class size is concerned that will remain the same\n\n\nThe education minister had also said autonomous schools would be\nmore like an intermediate grade of schools between independent schools and\nneighbourhood schools\n\n\nMany principals like mister Tan Teck Kwee from Victoria School\nwelcome this idea\n\n\nHowever some parents while they welcome the setting up of\nautonomous schools believe we shouldn't expect too much out of them \n\n\nAnd doctor Gwee Ee Hian and academic consultant sees yet another\nreason why autonomous schools may not match up to their independent\ncounterparts Well what does the education minister think Well one thing for\nsure for parents like Lawrence Teo autonomous schools is a welcome choice", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL",

brings\n\n\nHe's seen victims as young as twenty-one die from the disease struck\ndown even before their prime\n\n\nFor many the suffering wasn't only in death but also in the lonely\nwait for it\n\n\nWhat started out as silent HIV infection is know now full-bloom aids\nfor Richard\n\n\nHis family still doesn't know that his immune system has broken down\nand now even a common cold can kill him\n\n\nLike many other victims Richard thought it could never happen to him\n\n\nOfficial Aids awareness programmes have been set in motion\n\n\nBut with relatively few people infected the disease seem far removed\n\n\nThis doesn't make aids any less real\n\n\nOne can carry the virus for years but not know it and with each\nsexual encounter the deadly virus gets another chance to claim a new victim\n\n\nIt's also not unusual for victims to be unsure who they got the\ndisease from\n\n\nThis is the Thailand we are familiar with\n\n\nBut in this land of smiles aids has reached epidemic proportions\n\n\nEighteen year old Noi has been working here for just over a year\n\n\nHer monthly test for HIV have so far been negative\n\n\nBut like thousands of other Thai prostitutes Noi has a seventy per\ncent chance of getting aids and passing it on\n\n\nFrom the estimated two to four hundred thousand Thais infected with\nHIV virus the future is a hospital like this\n\n\nUntil two years ago twenty-two year old Suti spends most of his\nnight at Patpong one of Bangkok's famous night spots\n\n\nIn search of a better life he left home and family in impoverished\nNorth-east Thailand\n\n\nBut a few years later he tested positive for HIV\n\n\nHe's been here since\n\n\nTen other young men share this ward with Suti\n\n\nAll are being treated for symptoms related to HIV infection\n\n\nThey do not yet have full-blown aids and are sent home when the\nsymptoms clear\n\n\nDoctor Soomsin has seen over five hundred patients in the last four\nyears\n\n\nSixty have since died from the disease\n\n\nLike elsewhere the victims are no longer just drug-users or\nhomosexuals\n\n\nAids has states its claim on heterosexuals here\n\n\nThe government estimates that by the year 2000 one in three deaths\nin Thailand will be of Aids\n\n\nThis frightening spectre has raised much public concern and\nThailand has never done more to braised itself for the worse\n\n\nOne of the government's first steps was to approve the set-up of\nthis clinic\n\n\nBelieved to be Asia's first anonymous clinic it runs test for the\nHIV virus\n\n\nBut such as the stigma of aids that for the clinic to be effective\nit also promotes itself as a place to test for hepatitis B and syphilis\n\n\nFor those who come because of aids are counselled\n\n\nThey're also advised on safer sex and how to cope with the disease\n\n\nThe main drawing point is that the patient doesn't have to give his\nname\n\n\nTo ensure that the test are kept confidential he's only known as a\nnumber\n\n\nSince the Thai Red Cross opened it five months ago this clinic has\nseen about fifty people coming everyday\n\n\nMore are being planned as it's proven to be a turning point for\nmany\n\n\nDespite this promising start and the efforts to maintain anonymity\nit may take more to convince the thousands who need to be reached\n\n\nThese performers from a group called Empower bridges that gap\n\n\nTo break the ice humour is often used to give the message of aids\nprevention across and it's aimed not just at bar-workers but also at their\npatrons\n\n\nThe work of Empower however goes beyond these night performances\n\n\nIt also runs a drop in centre for the bar-workers\n\n\nSo when they're not practising for the next performance some girls\ncome here for counselling as well as English lessons\n\n\nFor those who had picked up the language English has been their\npassport to better jobs as well as loads of self-confidence\n\n\nAnd it's largely through efforts of people like Chantawepah Arpisok\nthat many bar-workers may just escape the clutches of aids\n\n\nThe director of Empower she started reaching out to the girls as\nearly as 1985\n\n\nThere are still quite a few places where Empower isn't welcome\n\n\nBut even if they're given the go ahead the message of safer sex\ndoesn't always go down well\n\n\nOne person who has been supporting Empower is twenty-three year old\nSudawan\n\n\nShe's a mamasan to the girls here at Rafifi in the Patpong district\n\n\nBut it's not always that neat\n\n\nSome girls who refuse to appear on camera told us that condom or\nnot they must get more than four clients a month or have their salaries\ndeducted\n\n\nAnd with business down from the aids scare the girls may not have\nthe luxury of being selective\n\n\nThere's another problem\n\n\nThough the girls have never been more familiar with the safer sex\nmessage they aren't always convince that it's necessary\n\n\nChiangmai known for its pristine scenery has also been scarred by\naids\n\n\nMore than five thousand HIV cases have so far been detected\n\n\nBut unlike Bangkok it's had better success in promoting condom\nusage\n\n\nTwenty-seven year old Lim has worked in this brothel for three\nyears\n\n\nShe was recently recruited by the health authorities to teach the\nother girls about protecting themselves\n\n\nThrough Lim and others like her condom usage has been effectively\nenforced\n\n\nBut it wasn't easy convincing the girls\n\n\nThis firm stand may just save Lim and many others\n\n\nWherever condom usage is enforced fewer new HIV cases have surfaced\n\n\nBut still one in eight prostitutes are believed to have the aids\nvirus\n\n\nThose who have it continue working\n\n\nThose who don't continue to be at risk\n\n\nTo stem the spread Thailand is determined to curb the vice trade\nMinister Michye <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nA bill now being considered by the Thai government aims to prevent\nunder-aged girls from going into prostitution\n\n\nIf passed severe action will also be taken against those who force\nor trick girls into the trade\n\n\nTo deter more from being lured into prostitution for the money the\ngovernment has joint hands with private companies to adopt villages and offer\nthe women alternative employment\n\n\nBut curbing the vice trade is just part of Thailand's bigger fight\nagainst aids\n\n\nThis is a village crematorium in Chiangmai\n\n\nSome months ago relatives of one aids victim refuse to attend his\nfuneral\n\n\nFearing contaminated air the villages even stopped another\ncremation from taking place\n\n\nFrightening myths continue to surround the disease\n\n\nThe unwillingness to come to grips with it has also led to\nignorance which aids feed on\n\n\nMany still think of aids as someone else's disease\n\n\nThis attitude is changing but slowly\n\n\nThe Chiangmai University Hospital is one of the major hospitals\ninvolved in the treatment of aids but unlike the rest it made sure that the\naids patient is not isolated\n\n\nSo if he has a cold he'll be treated along with the others with the\nsame ailment\n\n\nBut the majority of Thais still feel that aids has nothing to do\nwith them\n\n\nA recent survey showed that eighty-six per cent of Thai men\nbelieved that there was very little chance of ever getting aids\n\n\nComplacency is not only widespread in Thailand but also in\nSingapore\n\n\nMany continue in activities that puts them at risk\n\n\nOf the ninety-nine identified cases here almost half are\nheterosexuals\n\n\nMany of them who contracted the virus claim they got it from\nprostitutes here or overseas\n\n\nBut as in Thailand the prostitutes themselves face an even higher\nrisk\n\n\nDespite this many who've come here do so for the same reason\n\n\nBut some may get more than they bargain\n\n\nThat's the reason why leaflets like these are handled out to them\nduring check-ups\n\n\nArranged by the anti-vice enforcement unit such checks have so far\nfound thirteen Thai prostitutes HIV positive\n\n\nAll have since been sent home\n\n\nBut because the aids virus can lie dormant and undetected for\nmonths\n\n\nThese check-ups though regular could mislead the women and their\nclients telling them that they're clean when actually not\n\n\nThe women themselves are aware of the need to practice safe sex but\noften they have to give in to their customers\n\n\nBut it's a gamble even teenage prostitutes are willing to take\n\n\nDetection of aids is even more difficult amongst them as they\noperate independently\n\n\nSo far the aids virus has spared this group of Singaporeans\n\n\nBut it may just be a matter of time as surveys have shown that\nteenagers are becoming more sexually active without taking the necessary\nprecautions against pregnancy venereal disease or aids\n\n\nAnd with aids now spreading within the heterosexual community any\nteenager or adult engaging in casual sex runs the risk of being infected\n\n\nPlaces which hold the highest potential for sexual encounters may\nwell become areas where the aids virus next lurks\n\n\nSo one needn't step into the back main alleys of brothels to get\naids\n\n\nThe risk are of course higher but it's not confine to sexual\ncontacts with high risk groups like prostitutes\n\n\nIn fact it can now be transmitted within the home\n\n\nThis one year old Thai baby may not live beyond six months\n\n\nShe has the HIV virus\n\n\nAbandoned at birth Euwan <unclear> word </unclear> was born to an\ninfected mother who caught the virus from her husband\n\n\nThailand is now facing the problem of aids babies\n\n\nAnd so is Singapore\n\n\nThis is a TV ad warning the Thai public about aids\n\n\nSingaporeans will soon see local versions\n\n\nBut the fight against the encroaching shadow of aids goes beyond\nawareness\n\n\nIt is now a choice every individual has to make \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nWhen the publicity agent of Cameron McKintosh Incorporated\noffered me a free trip to New

who's seen Les Mis to date\n\n\nThe late Alfred Hitchcock once said to a friend after reading\nVictor Hugo's literary masterpiece Les Miserables that book will make a\nwonderful musical\n\n\nAnd he

amidst the applause there's still a long way to go\n\n\nLocal labels are making their mark but only locally\n\n\nThere's still a wide world out there where Singapore designers must\nboldly go or get behind in the race\n\n\nBut to get there how does Singapore designers offer that special\ntouch\n\n\nThomas Wee has been in the local fashion business for more than\ntwenty years\n\n\nNow he's gone international selling his designs in Japan\n\n\nHe's trying to capture that distinctive look but so far overseas\nopportunities have been few\n\n\nBut what can be done to use the familiar heritage we have to\nadvantage\n\n\nDesigners in the past have tried to incorporate the different\nethnic styles into one and recently we have the Singapore dress with orchid\nmotifs\n\n\nFor one young designer who gets much of her inspiration from\nChinatown Khee tries to bring together East and West fusing together new and\nold\n\n\nKhee is looking for designs which have that distinctive look\n\n\nShe spends hours searching for that special something\n\n\nPerhaps surprisingly it seems local fashion isn't as vibrant as it\nlooks\n\n\nBut how do you feel the pulse of the international fashion beat\n\n\nIt's more than just looking inwards\n\n\nShaping a fashion business is all about people\n\n\nIt can't be done alone but putting together the right theme seems\nto frustrate most local designers\n\n\nThe unanswered questions are trained workers and backup\n\n\nThere's a feeling that there's not enough response to the demands\nof the industry\n\n\nIn fact there are now courses in marketing but they're very new\n\n\nThe La Salle International Fashion School runs classes especially\nfor the industry with the help from the Economic Development Board\n\n\nStudents learn the rudiments of fashion retail all aspects of the\nbusiness and above all how to sell\n\n\nMarketing the cornerstone of fashion and a solid business base\n\n\nBut a designer still needs ideas\n\n\nSo La Salle emphasizes good designs\n\n\nGetting that good design is a painstaking business and it's vital\nfor students to get that hands on experience\n\n\nThe idea of practical training seems to have grabbed many\n\n\nIt's a crucial new trend for would be fashion makers after all\nthey're the industry's leaders of the future\n\n\nAnd hands on training is a start in the establishment of Singapore\nas a fashion training centre for the Asia-Pacific\n\n\nFrom cutting room to cat-walk the young designers have a lot\nresting on them the future of the whole industry\n\n\nThis is a traditional way of looking for bargains in fashion\naccessories\n\n\nSoon there'll be a way of looking for the new fashion trends as\nwell\n\n\nThat's when the fashion resource centre opens this year\n\n\nUnlike the present situation buyers and sellers will be able to do\nbusiness in a more conducive atmosphere\n\n\nAt the moment getting the right fashion or design is mainly a\nquestion of luck\n\n\nThe same is true where it comes to textiles\n\n\nOften Singapore buyers are a season behind\n\n\nTheir choices while the best are often illusive\n\n\nThis sort of deal goes on all the time in the textile business\n\n\nBut it's often time consuming and mostly expensive for the buyer\n\n\nSo plans are afoot to establish Singapore's own fabric centre\n\n\nBecoming recognised internationally that's what Esther Tay aspires\nto be\n\n\nShe's just returned from Tokyo where her collection was exhibited\nalong with big names like Ungaro and Tierry Mugler\n\n\nIt's a difficult to penetrate and she has to take into\nconsideration the preferences of the Japanese\n\n\nWhile Esther concentrates on the design her husband Paul helps to\nmarket her clothes and there are ambitious plans to sell a total boutique\nconcept to American retailers\n\n\nWith the number of orders coming in thick and fast how's the\ncompany going to manage\n\n\nActually going global is a big step to take\n\n\nBut right in the heart of London that's where one Singapore\ndesigner has decided to take on the best of Britain\n\n\nIn fact the operation was so successful that within a year a second\nCelia Loe boutique is being planned\n\n\nHow did Celia succeed and what are the problems faced in making\ninroads overseas\n\n\nTo satisfy the discerning taste of her clientele Celia churns out\nnearly ninety designs a month\n\n\nTo stay one up she has gone high-tech\n\n\nHer patterns and measurements are all done with the aid of a\ncomputer\n\n\nHowever Celia believes in that personal touch\n\n\nDespite a tight schedule she supervises a team of cutters and\nseamstresses to ensure the right quality\n\n\nBut this operation is an exception\n\n\nSome feel that to make an impact overseas Singapore has to identify\nitself as part of the Asean group\n\n\nTo wear fashion like this you have to be young and you have to be\nyoung to think of the designs\n\n\nThe Asean young designers' contest throws up the best in the region\nand it does something more\n\n\nIt's a channel of expression making Asean countries together and\nmaybe Singapore will be refocused\n\n\nTo attract Asean designers to set up base here last year's winner\nfrom the Phillipines won a scholarship to study at the La Salle International\nFashion School\n\n\nIn the mean time local fashion makers are grouping together to\ncreate an impact\n\n\nStyle Singapore a joint effort by the local fashion trade is a\nretail outlet which showcases some sixty local designers\n\n\nSome fledgling others more established\n\n\nStyle Singapore is modeled after London's exclusive Birlington\nArcade and it hopes to be a showcase of Singapore fashion\n\n\nDesigns to catch the eye and they're mainly from younger designers\nwho come out of school and display their wares\n\n\nThese represent the first step to sell Singapore fashion abroad\n\n\nAnother idea is to sell the rights to a Singapore label overseas\n\n\nSi-ann was the first to launch its Singapore range as normal styles\n\n\nLaunched in October last year Si-ann is the first Singapore\nretailer to go global through franchising\n\n\nAt the moment it's concentrating on the regional market Malaysia\nIndonesia Brunei and Thailand\n\n\nBut its eventual aim is to go completely international\n\n\nThe idea of franchising was supported by the Trade Development\nBoard\n\n\nTheir intention is to look at different ways of going global\n\n\nAt the moment Singapore has attracted many international labels\n\n\nBut what could make it really exciting is to get the designers too\nand generate more ideas\n\n\nBut even if we could attract a top fashion master like Yves Saint\nLaurent to Singapore there is still some apprehension\n\n\nThe local industry is experimenting with different approaches as\nit's also looking for that very distinctive style\n\n\nWhile it may takes some time to develop that distinctive Singapore\nstyle the ground is being laid for fashioning a niche \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nCaroline Ng lives with the fear that one day come an emergency\nshe'll have to receive donated blood from the blood bank\n\n\nCaroline is just one of several people I've talked to who've raised\nconcerns about getting Aids from donated blood\n\n\nAnd it appears these concerns have some basis\n\n\nYou see our blood bank does test all donated blood for diseases\nincluding Aids and these tests are well-known to be very stringent\n\n\nBut the problem is these tests are not full-proof especially so\nwith Aids and that's because of this fact\n\n\nFor a period of between three to six months immediately after\nyou've caught the virus you won't be able to detect it no matter how well you\ntest for it\n\n\nThis is what doctors call the latent period or window period\n\n\nThe virus remains hidden and won't show up in any test\n\n\nAnd according to doctor Koh Kwang Poh a G P who's been in practice\nfor twenty-eight years this is where the danger lies\n\n\nSo it would seem that the best way to make sure that donor blood\nisn't infected with Aids is to keep it in the blood bank until after the\nwindow period is over which is between three to six months and then test the\nblood one more time\n\n\nIf the blood passes the second test then should it be used\n\n\nBut this isn't being done\n\n\nI found out that our National Blood Bank only keeps blood for up to\nforty-two days which isn't even two months\n\n\nI asked the blood bank why they don't make an allowance for this\nwindow period\n\n\nThey told me they can't keep the blood for so long because red\nblood cells die after forty-two days\n\n\nAnd warm blood can be frozen it's not practical to do so because\nit takes too long to get it ready for use in an emergency\n\n\nBut if that's the case Caroline wants the right to choose another\noption\n\n\nWhat Caroline is talking about is a process called directed blood\ndonation an option provided overseas\n\n\nAnd this option has its advantages\n\n\nAccording to hematologist doctor Toh King Keat\n\n\nHowever our National Blood Bank still stands by its policy\n\n\nThey will not provide directed donation simply because a patient\nask for it\n\n\nAccording to them one reason is that blood transfusions between\nclose relative donors and patients raise the dangers of fatal graft versus\nhost disease\n\n\nThis disease occurs when you take blood from someone biologically\nrelated to you like your siblings or parents\n\n\nBut studies show that chances of the disease occurring are less\nthan zero point one per cent\n\n\nAnd it can be eliminated if the donated blood goes through a\nprocess called irradiation\n\n\nThere's another reason why the blood bank won't change its policy\nand that's administration problems\n\n\nAt the moment the blood bank handles ninety per cent of total\ntransfusions here and under the present system donor blood is stored in the\nfour main categories of rhesus positive and negative A B AB and O types\n\n\nBut with directed donation things will be more complicated\n\n\nThat's because every pint will be reserved for a specific patient\nand so it's up to the blood bank to make sure that each pint goes to the\nright patient\n\n\nNaturally this would mean more administration problems and paper\nwork for the bank\n\n\nBut doctor Koh feels that shouldn't stop the blood bank \n\n\n\n<$C> \n\nDo you like shopping\n\n\nWell I love it\n\n\nAnd like a lot of other Singaporeans there's nothing that attracts\nme more than a big sale\n\n\nSo it's no wonder that almost anywhere we turn we're bound to see\na sale sign\n\n\nIt doesn't matter if you're in a neighbourhood shop or in the\nheart of Orchard road\n\n\nWell here in the People's Park Complex I counted about forty shops\nto having sales\n\n\nThat's about one-third of a total number of shops here\n\n\nWell having a sale is one thing but whether you are really getting\na bargain is another\n\n\nHere's a shop in the complex was holding its annual sale\n\n\nAnd it claimed all items have been discounted by twenty up to\neighty per cent\n\n\nLet's find out what the deal really is\n\n\nUnfortunately halfway through my interview with the salesman our\ncamera ran into some technical problems\n\n\nAnd while we're trying to fix the camera the salesman actually\ntore the tag off and put a new tag on\n\n\nOne that said sixty-nine dollars\n\n\nThis is what happened when we continued the interview\n\n\nNow I came to this came shop last week and the price then was\nseventy-nine dollars\n\n\nSo if there was really a pricing error as the salesman claimed\nthen why wait until now to change the price\n\n\nAnd anyway on this other pair outside the shop it still says\nseventy-nine\n\n\nI also checked the price of this same model in different shopping\ncentres and at most places they were selling it for about sixty-two dollars\n\n\nBut I found this shop in the Raffles City area which was selling\nit for fifty-six and it wasn't even on sale \n\n\nSo even assuming that the first had made a pricing error its\nsupposed sale price is still what other shops charge normally And what was\nworse this seems to be a very common practice among shopkeepers I checked\nwith a few more shops and one in Geylang was selling it cheaper and it wasn't\neven on sale And it's not only small outlets that are guilty of holding so\ncalled sale Even big department stores do it So it's clear some shops are\ndeliberately missing the word sale and consumers are being had Is there\nanything we can do about it Albert Tan is with the Consumers' Association of\nSingapore And that's the way it is in other countries In Germany and Belgium\nfor instance the law only allows shops to hold two sales a year the winter\nsale and the summer sale And these are real sales because they have to\ndisplay old and new prices Oscar Kusi Belgium's Trade Commissioner to\nSingapore explain how seriously the Belgium government takes this law Closer\nto home even stores in Malaysia have to get a permit before they can reduce\ntheir prices And there's a time limit imposed on the sale So would it help to\nhave a similar law here? The Consumers' Association of Singapore seems to\nthink so", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c285ade2-6c4f-4914-82df-f251607278ba", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.726600+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nHi I'm Lisa welcome to Hey Singapore\n\n\nAs Singapore develops many physical traces of the past are slowly\nbeing erased\n\n\nHDB flats have long taken over kampongs and large expanses of parks\nhave replaced the swamps and forests\n\n\nYet despite the changes modernisation haven't totally removed all\nthe traces of the past\n\n\nTraces of the solitary tombs for example scattered throughout the\nisland are single and sometimes totally abandoned tombs\n\n\nTombs like this one here at Monk's Hill and another at Radin Mas\n\n\nWho are buried here and why haven't they been removed\n\n\nTonight on Hey Singapore the mystery of the solitary tombs\n\n\nLook hard enough around Singapore and you may come across solitary\ntombs\n\n\nSome of these are well-known and well documented like this one here\nat Outram Road\n\n\nIt belongs to Tan Tock Seng and for years it has remained\nundisturbed\n\n\nAnother solitary tomb that is slightly more well-known can be fond\nhere at Fort Canning\n\n\nAs to whose remains it holds well that's a bit of a controversy\nthough it's believed to be Iskandar Shah's\n\n\nLast season we dug up some facts about this tomb here at Stevens\nRoad and we put to rest the much believed rumour that it held Raffles'\nmistress' remains and tonight we go in search of more solitary tombs\n\n\nOur search led us to yet another solitary tomb in the Monk's Hill\narea\n\n\nThis is where Monk's Hill School is located but little is known\nabout how the place got its name\n\n\nPerhaps it was named after a monk who may have once lived in this\narea or for a temple that may have once stood here\n\n\nWe headed to the present temple in the area\n\n\nPerhaps someone here could shed light on a rumoured old temple\n\n\nUnfortunately the caretaker was not around to answer our questions\n\n\nNext to the temple was a mechanic's workshop and one of the staff\nthere led us to what he believed to be the remains of a person who may have\nstayed in the old temple\n\n\nIt was an abandoned tombstone that was surrounded almost wrapped by\na tree\n\n\nWe couldn't make out the inscription on the tomb nor can we find\nany clues that might tell us of the tomb was connected to a temple that was\nsaid to exist in the area hence the name Monk's Hill\n\n\nNobody at the workshop could tell us more so we looked for the\nowner of the plot of land\n\n\nThe address was 147 Bukit Timah Road but our search came to nought\n\n\nWe were unable to locate the owner of the land or the owner of the\nworkshop\n\n\nOur next step was to find our tomb maker friend Mr Yeo\n\n\nHe had helped us with some interesting leads with our investigation\nof the tomb along Stevens Road\n\n\nWe hoped he will be able to shed some light on this mystery tomb as\nwell\n\n\nHe wasted no time in trying to decipher the characters on the stone\n\n\nWe hoped it would tell us more about the temple that was believed\nto be on the hill where Outram Secondary and Monk's Hill Secondary Schools\nonce stood\n\n\nWe able to decipher four distinct Chinese characters\n\n\nMr Yeo explained that they were time references based on the\nreigning monarch in imperial China\n\n\nTo pinpoint the date he would need to consult a periodical of the\nChinese calendar\n\n\nNext he tried to read the name inscribed on the tombstone\n\n\nThis proved difficult because of the tree\n\n\nThe roots have enveloped the tombstone covering all the\ninscriptions but we had to get to the root of our mystery tree or no tree\n\n\nWe tried to scratch away some of the soil that had settled in but\nthat did not help much either\n\n\nSlowly and very painstakingly Mr Yeo managed to finally uncover\nmost of the inscribed name\n\n\nThe first and last character on the tombstone were Tan and Teck\n\n\nMr Yeo then moved on to the tomb's features to see if he can come\nup with even more clues\n\n\nIn the meantime our research assistant Kai Lin adamantly kept\ntrying to read the missing part of the inscription\n\n\nInitially Mr Yeo thought that the granite used might be from Pulau\nUbin where Singapore's early granite came from but after further inspection\nhe came up with a discovery that baffled us\n\n\nThe rocks used were not from Pulau Ubin but from Mandai which\npre-dated the quarry on Pulau Ubin\n\n\nThis also means that the tomb was built even before the nineteen\nhundreds\n\n\nAccording to Mr Yeo they aren't many tombstones in Singapore that\npre-date the twentieth century\n\n\nThis finding coupled with Kai Lin's deciphering of the second\ncharacter on the tombstone He spur us on\n\n\nMr Yeo also gave us other clues as to who might be in the tomb\n\n\nHe confirmed that it was the tomb of a male of Teochew origin\n\n\nThis was based on the outer rim marking guarding the tomb with\n<unclear> word </unclear> markers\n\n\nAccording to Mr Yeo the <unclear> word </unclear> could also mean\nthat the male buried here was a scholar and not a monk\n\n\nIn the course of our story we came up with many conflicting views\n\n\nSome said that there was never a temple on Monk's Hill while others\nnot only claimed there was but that it was re-sited from Newton Circus and\nthose who lived here before claimed that the whole place was nothing but a\nrubber plantation\n\n\nIf all this is true then Monk's Hill may never have been the result\nof a monastery that was said to have been situated here\n\n\nMore questions about this tomb when we come back\n\n\nBack in his workshop Mr Yeo showed us the shape of a typical\nTeochew tombstone\n\n\nTrue enough it did look like the tombstone we just saw\n\n\nNext he showed us a Chinese calendar which not only showed the\nyears according to the <unclear> word </unclear> calendar correlated with the\nCninese Zodiac calendar but also the reigning monarchs in imperial China\n\n\nBased on this calendar Mr Yeo was able to pinpoint that the person\nburied in the tombstone died in 1873\n\n\nOn a subsequent visit to the temple we met an old man who live in\nthe temple\n\n\nHe only wanted to be known as Lim\n\n\nHe provided us more answers to our mystery but took us further from\nour original premise that Monk's Hill was named after a temple\n\n\nAccording to him the temple we spoke of was only built in the\nnineteen fifties\n\n\nWhere the petrol kiosk now stand was a kampong area and behind it a\nprivate garden\n\n\nHe had never heard of a temple in the vicinity\n\n\nWhen asked about the tomb he couldn't say who it belong to but what\nhe revealed took us by surprise\n\n\nUnder these two burned offering areas were two other tombs marked\nby these joss-sticks\n\n\nAnd there was a third tomb just a metre away again marked\njoss-sticks\n\n\nWe speculated that these tombs could have been for those who were\nconnected with the temple in some way but we were to be proven wrong\n\n\nMr Tan Peck Chew used to be a resident of the kampong but what he\ntold us shed even more doubt than light on our temple theory\n\n\nAccording to Mr Tan the temple now standing was not part of any\nbigger temple in the area\n\n\nIt was moved over in the nineteen fifties from a shrine that was\nfound under a tree at Newton Circus\n\n\nTo his earliest recollection there was never a temple in the area\nwhere the school now stands it was in fact a plantation\n\n\nWe asked Mr Tan if he had seen the tomb before it was covered up by\nthe tree\n\n\nHe couln't remember the full name of the man buried in the burial\nplot\n\n\nAccording to him the man was very rich and had his entire family\nburied in the same area\n\n\nThe two tombs covered over by the temple was smaller tombs and were\nthose of his two servants\n\n\nThere was another tomb in which his wife was buried and that tomb\nis completely hidden by this massive tree\n\n\nWell our search for how Monk's Hill got its name uncovered more\nquestions than answers\n\n\nOne thing's for sure this is not a monk's tomb or was Monk's Hill\nreally named after a temple\n\n\nIf so why are there no records of this temple\n\n\nOur trace at the National Archive also came to nought as none of\nthe early maps of Singapore seem to mark the presense of a temple and both Mr\nLim and Mr Tan were quite sure that there was never a temple in the vicinity\n\n\nIf it was a temple then could it have been named after a rich\nlandowner and what are the tombstones\n\n\nWhose was it\n\n\nGiven the grandeur of its original design could it have been the\ntomb of somebody influential\n\n\nWell one thing's for certain the person this tomb belongs to was\nnot the reason for this place being called Monk's Hill\n\n<$B> \n\nFrom Monk's Hill we now go to Radin Mas\n\n\nThere are some stories about Radin Mas which apparently date back a\nthousand years\n\n\nYet others say that the actual history of Radin Mas only began a\nhundred years ago\n\n\nThe stories that revolved around Radin Mas have many\ninterpretations but the one that stands out most has to be the golden\nprincess\n\n\nSo it's the golden princess fact or myth\n\n\nThis sprawling kampong was named after a tomb\n\n\nMany versions of the forklore have surrounded how kampong Radin Mas\ngot its name\n\n\nThey range from those that say Radin Mas was a beautiful Javanese\nprincess who was killed while trying to save her father Tun Radin Mas the\ndevout Muslim of royal blood\n\n\nWe went in search of the true story of Radin Mas\n\n\nMr Haji <unclear> word </unclear> a leader of the <unclear> word\n</unclear> mosque near Radin Mas told us what he knew\n\n\nMr Haji <unclear> word </unclear> account of Radin Mas is by and\nfar the most widely accepted one that Radin Mas was a Javanese princess from\nthe <unclear> word </unclear> era and was killed protecting her father\n\n\nBut there was still many questions that needed answers so we went\nup to Radin Mas' burial ground to see if there were any clues which we could\nunearthed\n\n\nThe grounds was still well-maintained\n\n\nIt was obvious that there were still people who came up to pray at\nthis <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nHowever we could not find the caretaker of the place\n\n\nSome people we had asked earlier including Mr Haji <unclear> word\n</unclear> told us that the caretaker was from Indonesia and doesn't live\nhere anymore others said he died\n\n\nBut all this did not answer our questions\n\n\nWho has been taking care of this place\n\n\nThe tomb itself was found under a huge hollow tree and the tomb\nmarkers are wrapped in royal yellow cloth\n\n\nOn our way down from the <unclear> word </unclear> we also noticed\na smaller burial plot\n\n\nThe tombstone markers was also wrapped in royal cloth\n\n\nWe asked Mr Haji <unclear> word </unclear> who it was for\n\n\nWe were not convinced that that was all to the story of Radin Mas\n\n\nOne of her links to <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nNow this was recorded in the history books\n\n\nIt was at this mosque that we were able to find new answers and a\nwhole new story about the life of Radin Mas\n\n\nWe met Mr Haji Abu <unclear> word </unclear> who was the leader of\nthe mosque\n\n\nLike all our other leads he was reluctant at first to tell us more\nabout the story of Radin Mas but after much persuasion he told us the story\nthrough our interpreter Mohammed\n\n\nAccording to him Radin Mas was not a princess but a commoner who\nwas a concubine of Tunku <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nThey lived in the late nineteen century\n\n\nThis tally with some of the historical records which tied Radin\nMas to one Tunku <unclear> word </unclear> who died in the nineteen hundreds\n\n\nThey lived in the royal palace which is where the old Radin Mas\nPrimary School stood \n\n\nWhat Mr <unclear> word </unclear> went on to tell us was even\nmore shocking\n\n\nRadin Mas was not accorded with any official status because she\nwas a concubine that is not legally married to the Tunku\n\n\nThis explains why her tomb lies near Mount Faber while the rest\nof the royal family were buried in the royal burial plot of Telok Blangah\nRoad\n\n\nThe story was a total turn-around from the other stories that we\nheard about Radin Mas\n\n\nMr Haji <unclear> word </unclear> also did not recall any story\nof her sacrificing her life for a father", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source":

symptoms\nof more serious health problems\n\n\nWhat happens when you lose your voice because of a paralysed vocal\ncord\n\n\nYour voice what can you do if you lose it\n\n\nSome of us use it more often than anyone else does\n\n\nOthers abuse it yet all of us need it our voice\n\n\nIt comes so naturally that we hardly think twice when we use it but\nthe moment we lose it that's when we will miss it most\n\n\nSeventy-five year old Madam Lim had one such close encounter just\nthis June\n\n\nThe experience was very trying for the out-going Madam Lim who used\nto enjoy shopping chatting over the phone and even over-night mahjong\nsessions\n\n\nBut all these had to go when she started losing her voice\n\n\nBut not knowing what the real cause was Madam Lim kept drinking\nwater and taking cough medication in the hope that her voice would return\nsomeday\n\n\nLittle did she realise that her voice loss had nothing to do with\nher sore throat but everything to do with her paralysed vocal cord\n\n\nMadam Lim was diagnosed with cancer of the lungs in June this year\nand within days she started to lose her voice as the tumor was sitting on her\nnerves paralysing her left vocal cord\n\n\nBut for the man on the street like her how could she have known\nbetter\n\n\nIn a normal vocal cord the two vocal folds would meet in the\nmid-line of the throat region and when air flows from the lungs to the vocal\ncords the vibrations would generate the sounds for voice production\n\n\nIf one of the vocal folds is malfunctioning there would be a gap\nbetween the two vocal folds causing difficulty in speech\n\n\nAs if struggling with a hoarse throat and battling with her lung\ncancer isn't enough she chokes on her every drink\n\n\nNew adjustments it almost seems too much for Madam Lim to cope\n\n\nMadam Lim went for the scan the results confirm that her left vocal\nfold was indeed malfunctioning and she needed the operation to correct her\nparalysed cord\n\n\nThough she resisted the idea of having to undergo an operation her\nfear of going mute won her over\n\n\nBut not only was the operation simple and fuss free Madam Lim could\neven choose her voice\n\n\nSo far <unclear> word </unclear> has a success rate of about\nseventy to eighty per cent\n\n\nThe operation which takes place under local anesthesia simply\nattains results that are too good to be

with dignity\n\n\nRegurgitation of gastric juices in the esophagus\n\n\nWho are those more lightly to suffer from heartburn find out after\nthe break\n\n\nEveryone eats but not everyone can experience the joy of eating\n\n\nSome may encounter indigestion after a big feast while others\nexperience heartburn because of a reflux of gastric juices\n\n\nHeartburn what causes this condition\n\n\nPatient's digestive tract will usually feel bloated after eating\ntoo much you feel as though there is a lot of gas in your stomach\n\n\nThis results in a pain when you feel as if your heart is burning\n\n\nThis is how the term heartburn is coined when you have heartburn\nyou will feel as if the area around your heart is burning\n\n\nA slimy mucus-like substance protects our gastric walls this\nsubstance prevents any discomfort caused by the acidic gastric juices in our\nstomach\n\n\nThe esophagus which is link to our gastric tract is more likely to\nbe affected by gastric juices since it is not protected by any slimy\nsubstance\n\n\nThis results in the burning feeling from heartburn\n\n\nAccording to Dr Cheng more and more Singaporeans are suffering from\nheartburn this is mostly due to our diet and way of life\n\n\nIt could be that Singaporeans are eating too much oily fatty food\nlike burgers and other similar kinds of greasy processed food\n\n\nEating too well can result in obesity this may also cause heartburn\n\n\nAnother reason is that patients are more concerned about their\nhealth these days and to go to the doctor whenever they feel uncomfortable\n\n\nBecause of this more cases of heartburn are discovered now than was\ncompared with before\n\n\nWe are also beginning to understand more about heartburn and this\naids in diagnosing the condition\n\n\nFoods and fluids must first pass through the esophagus or gullet to\nget to the gastric\n\n\nThe lower end of the gullet is the main area where the\nregurgitation of the gastric juices occurs and people who are over-weight\nmost of the abdominal is taken up by fat this pushes the stomach hard-up\nagainst the diaphragm so that the acid produce by the stomach is squeezed\ninto the gullet\n\n\nWhen we eat excessively the resulting gastric pressure is also more\nlikely to force the gastric juices into the esophagus\n\n\nAs we age the stomach muscles would be more relaxed and less taut\n\n\nThis is part of the natural aging process\n\n\nWhen this occurs when our stomach walls and lining are in relaxed\nstate and if there is an increase in gastric pressure the pressure would\nforce the food and gastric juices back up into the gullet or the esophagus\n\n\nThen the question is what causes the increase in gastric pressure\n\n\nAs we get older the abdomen grows bigger and this would result in a\npressure that which pushes the food from the gastric upward to the esophagus\n\n\nAs the population ages the number of heartburn patients increases\n\n\nHow is heartburn treated\n\n\nUsually the patients would work out a way themselves\n\n\nThey may consult a family doctor and take the medication prescribed\nor they may buy some over-the-counter pain-killers or medicine for their\ngastric pain and this can be quite effective\n\n\nIf the heartburn occurs often and causes a lot of pain or if we\ncannot eat because it causes too much pain and you lose weight you must\nconsult the doctor\n\n\nA patient can find out how serious his or her condition is through\na gastric endoscopy examination\n\n\nThere are differing degrees of heartburn\n\n\nWhen there is a regurgitation of gastric juices into the esophagus\nslight inflammation will occur and the esophagus will be slightly swollen\n\n\nFurther stimulation of the esophagus especially at the lower end\nwill result in ulcers and bleeding\n\n\nIn severe cases of heartburn the self-structure around of the\nesophagus will start to ulcerate\n\n\nIn the long run the esophagus will modify its inner lining so that\nit's similar to what we have in our stomach to protect itself from\nstimulation of the gastric juices\n\n\nThis is called <unclear> word </unclear> esophagus however we don't\nknow who will develop this condition\n\n\nSome people may not develop <unclear> word </unclear> esophagus at\nall while others may stand a higher chance of getting cancer once they have\n<unclear> word </unclear> esophagus\n\n\nThere is about a seventy per cent chance of getting cancer when\n<unclear> word </unclear> develops\n\n\nSo what may appear an inconsequential ailment can actually be the\nbeginning of severe illnesses\n\n\nNot everyone recognises the symptoms of heartburn\n\n\nThis condition can affect anyone without warning\n\n\nWhen you feel a sour taste in your mouth it indicates a\nregurgitation of gastric juices into the esophagus and the mouth\n\n\nThis may mean that the condition of the reflux is quite serious\n\n\nIt is even more severe if the gastric juices irritate your throat\nand cause asthma\n\n\nOver the counter antacids can only relieve the symptoms of\nheartburn but they are unable to do anything about the slackening of the\nstomach muscles\n\n\nThe only way to prevent the reflux of gastric juices is to change\nyour eating habits\n\n\nWe should cut down on the amount of food we eat since the problem\nalways occurs after eating too much\n\n\nAlso do not lie down immediately after a meal\n\n\nThis means no supper because we usually go to bed right after\nsupper\n\n\nFor those who cannot prevent heartburn caused by the slackening of\nstomach muscles one way of reducing the regurgitation of gastric juices is to\nprop themselves up with one or two pillows when they sleep\n\n\nWhen the upper half of the body is in a higher position the gastric\njuices are less lightly to flow upwards to the esophagus\n\n\nIn addition we should avoid food like coffee tea alcohol and\nchocolate these foods tend to cause discomfort in patients\n\n\nother methods may include losing weight and not wearing clothes\nthat are too tight-fitting\n\n\nClothes that are too tight at the abdomen will tend to push the\nfood from the stomach up the esophagus\n\n\nOne more thing people should be aware of is that the burning\nsensation caused by heartburn is similar to the symptoms of a heart-attack\n\n\nThis presents a danger to patients who are unable to differentiate\nbetween heartburn and a heart-attack\n\n\nIf a person feels uncomfortable when he is lying down while\nwatching television he is most probably suffering from heartburn\n\n\nHeart attacks usually occur when the patient is over-working his or\nherself\n\n\nIn this case having sufficient rest will help ease the condition\n\n\nA heart-attack usually last three to five minutes and beyond that\nthe condition is considered very dangerous\n\n\nHeartburn may last for up to two or three hours\n\n\nWhat causes constipation how often do we have to clear waste

{"text": "<$A> \n\nI'm Lisa and welcome to Hey Singapore\n\n\nTonight our story is more of curiosity rather than a mystery\n\n\nIt's about inventions local inventions\n\n\nInventions that were patented as early as the nineteen sixties\n\n\nMany of these inventions can be found in the files of CESA\n\n\nToday Singaporeans continue to put down their patents\n\n\nUnfortunately due to the high costs of producing a prototype and\nmass production many of them remained just patent inventions\n\n\nToday we go in search for the inventive Singaporean\n\n\nTonight we dig into the little known world of local inventors and\ntheir inventions starting with this strange gadget\n\n\nWhat is it\n\n\nWell it's used on something close to many of us\n\n\nIn fact it was invented to deal with a very thorny issue\n\n\nWe asked some people what they thought it was\n\n\nNo one seems to have any idea\n\n\nWhat is it\n\n\nWell the answer lies here at the Ngee Ann Polytechnic\n\n\nYou see the strange device is the work of these students who are\nabout to reveal to us what it does\n\n\nWatch closely\n\n\nA durian opener\n\n\nThese final year students took about three months to think up of\nthe idea and to make the device from scratch\n\n\nThis unusual opener can soon be available for a mere twenty dollars\n\n\nOur producer decided to try her hand on the durian opener after a\nfew false starts she finally gets the hang of it\n\n\nAnd she does find it quite effective\n\n\nBut this is just our amateur opinion would the experts agree\n\n\nWe brought the durian opener here at the junction of Albert and\nQueen Street to put it to the test\n\n\nSeems no one is willing to give our strange looking tool a try\nuntil we come across Mr Chong with many years behind him selling durians\n\n\nHe was not impressed\n\n\nNot satisfied we sought a second opinion Mr Ong is another long\ntime durian seller maybe he has a different opinion\n\n\nBut he didn't have an easy time of it\n\n\nAfter much sweating and swearing he managed to open a durian\n\n\nSo all's not lost\n\n\nThe durian sellers we spoke to were somewhat encouraging they felt\nthat the durian opener might be more useful for housewives than for the\nprofessionals\n\n\nBut the idea is a good one and with some modifications perhaps this\ndurian opener might be more effective\n\n\nOur next invention is one that starts here where we came across an\nunusual phenomenon\n\n\nLocked letterboxes what good are locked letterboxes\n\n\nHow will the postman deliver the mail\n\n\nWe traced these unusual letterboxes to a local inventor Mr Henry\nTan\n\n\nHenry an ex-police constable of many years started working on an\nidea to keep junk mail out of our letter boxes\n\n\nAn anti-junk mail letter box\n\n\nThe path to the final product did not come easily\n\n\nIt began with sketches and drawings followed by many prototypes the\nearliest which is this one\n\n\nHow did Henry come on the idea for an anti-junk mail letter box\n\n\nHe told us he was once nearly arrested for littering when clearing\nhis junk mail\n\n\nSo for all of us in HDB units maybe an end to junk mail\n\n\nHDB and a bright sunny day\n\n\nPerfect for housewives to hang out their freshly washed clothes to\ndry\n\n\nOr is it\n\n\nLiving in high-rise flats we all encounter the problem of\ninconsiderate neighbours who let their wet clothes drip all the way down\n\n\nDown to our carefully washed laundry and what happens\n\n\nOur clothes become soiled of course\n\n\nIs there a solution\n\n\nYes there is\n\n\nAt the Temasek Polytechnic School of Engineering\n\n\nWe asked Mr ? ? Teo and his students what they have come up with\n\n\nA retractable clothes shelter\n\n\nThis device is unique because it lets heat rays in through the\ntransparent shelter to dry the clothes but protects the clothes from being\nsoiled\n\n\nThe invention can be commercialised though it cost the students\nthree hundred dollars to build it\n\n\nMass production should bring the price down\n\n\nSo now there's no need to get frustrated or irritated\n\n\nJust go get retractable clothes shelter\n\n\nAnd all this dripping and soiling of our freshly washed clothes\nwill be a thing of the past\n\n\nWell although some of you may find that a rather strange invention\nit's actually quite a practical idea\n\n\nWe are now here at the National Archives Retro-spin\n\n\nAn exhibition of sounds in Singapore from the fifties to the\nnineties and it is here at this exhibition that we were to make an amazing\ndiscovery\n\n\nThis man here Jay Shotam he was the lead singer of one of the most\npopular groups in Singapore called the October Cherries back in the nineteen\nseventies\n\n\nJay and his brother claimed that they patented the first portable\ncassette player and filed it in London in nineteen seventy-six\n\n\nUnfortunately due to lack of funds for mass production the patent\nlapsed\n\n\nWhen we come back we speak to Jay Shotam and we take a look at some\nother amazing inventions by Singaporeans\n\n\nEarly this year the National Archives was planning an exhibition of\nthe sounds of Singapore from the fifties\n\n\nThe exhibition is on at the National Museum to the twenty second of\nSeptember and it was here that we were to uncover a most unusual story\n\n\nThe story of a man named Jay Shotam lead singer the group October\nCherries who claimed he patented the portable cassette player now more\ncommonly called the Walkman\n\n\nIt's here that we meet Mr Jay Shotam he has an amazing story to\ntell us\n\n\nA story so fantastic that we won't have believed it if not for the\nevidence\n\n\nIf you think that the concept behind the portable cassette player\ncame from Japan you may well be mistaken\n\n\nAbout twenty years ago four years before the launched product Jay\nhad invented a combined portable cassette player and headphone set\n\n\nIn the old days if you wanted to listen to music on the move well\nyou had to lurk one of these around\n\n\nThis is the story of Mr Jay Shotam the rest as they say is history\n\n\nWe move on to the other end of Singapore to find our next local\ninventor\n\n\nHe's Mr Pang Lian Seng and he's been dabbling in inventions for the\npast twenty years\n\n\nWe asked him what he had come up with and he pulled this out of his\nbag\n\n\nA self-cleaning duster\n\n\nThe duster works with a cleaning material mounted on rollers a\ndevice inside removes chalk dust and other particles that collect in a\nreservoir\n\n\nMr Pang had patented his invention not only in Singapore but also\nas far away as UK\n\n\nWhy so many patents\n\n\nHe tells us there isn't a body for world-wide patents and if\ninventors wanted to protect their ideas world-wide they must take up\nindividual patents issued I each country\n\n\nBack in the Ngee Ann Polytechnic we had come across a durian opener\n\n\nWell here another local culinary dish caught the attention of\nanother group of students\n\n\n? ? satay grilling machine\n\n\nElectric heaters inside this contraption cooks satay as the satay\nswirls around inside\n\n\nBut the most important question is does the satay still taste as\ngood as those grilled over glowing charcoal\n\n\nAnd here are more wacky inventions from our Ngee Ann Polytechnic\nstudents\n\n\nWhen we come back after the break we take a look at how one man\ninvented a product which is currently used by penguins and others who are\nstill trying to make their inventive dream a reality\n\n\nOur search for local inventions has led us to the Singapore Bird\nPark more specifically to the penguin display\n\n\nAmazingly we learned that the health and well-being of these\npenguins are partly dependent on a Singaporean invention\n\n\nThe germitrol what is the germitrol\n\n\nTo find out we tracked down Mr Derek Seah owner of Air Search\nTechnology\n\n\nAnd the germitrol an air cleaner that kills germs\n\n\nThis idea crew from a unique experience\n\n\nBut how do you measure whether germs air-borne germs emphasises\nDerek are effectively killed\n\n\nThis device does it\n\n\nArmed now with a better idea of the germitrol we decided to check\nit out in action\n\n\nHere inside the penguin enclosure\n\n\nA rare opportunity to be on the other side of the glass\n\n\nAmidst these curious and nosy penguins we saw the installed units\nworking away to keep the air germ-free for these birds\n\n\nAlthough the germitrol works invisibly Dr Wong from the Bird Park\nensures us the units work\n\n\nThe penguins are not the only ones benefiting from the invention\nthese little puffins who also live in enclosed artificially maintained\nenvironments also benefit from the germitrol\n\n\nWe're pretty sure that when Derek first drew up his sketches and\nprototypes he wasn't thinking of penguins and puffins but the invention has a\nway of ending up in the most unexpected places\n\n\nWe leave our feathered friends and head east to Eunos\n\n\nHe had wind of another local inventor frequently around the area\n\n\nHe's Mr Gan Chiu Liang and his invention\n\n\nA strange looking crate\n\n\nWhat is it\n\n\nWell we have to curb our curiosity as Mr Gan can only demonstrate\nhis invention elsewhere\n\n\nOur destination here at the Marina Square\n\n\nWe stopped at this half hour photo lab and waited patiently for Mr\nGan to arrive which he soon did\n\n\nPutting together his invention was a puzzle as Mr Gan started with\nthis camera\n\n\nThen this a special laser printer\n\n\nIn minutes Mr Gan finally had his invention up and running\n\n\nWhat does it do\n\n\nThis is Mr Gan's visual card system a system that creates and\nprints cards lie these or this\n\n\nOur crew tried Mr Gan's visual card system and we learned a unique\nfeature of the system\n\n\nHave your own photo on your name card so that's what the camera's\nfor\n\n\nHow does it all work\n\n\nWell it uses ordinary photographic film\n\n\nWe watched as the designs we had created appeared in this photo\nprocessing machine\n\n\nAnd as the pictures appear we saw our camera man a photo of\nhimself on his very own personalised name card all in about half an hour\n\n\nName cards are not the only things you can create with Mr Gan's\nsystem\n\n\nHow about giving away a unique birthday invitation like this one\n\n\nSo Singaporeans especially teenagers can look forward to creating\nanything\n\n\nThese samples should give you an idea of what to expect\n\n\nthough still in a prototype stage we were impressed that only with\nthis but also the other inventions of Singapore you have seen today\n\n\nThough some inventions may not be that practical we did come\nacross a few very enthusiastic inventors with rather brilliant ideas\n\n\nSome of which have been taken up on by manufacturers and are\ncurrently out in the market\n\n\nOthers remain in their planning stages\n\n\nAnd for anyone that makes it in the market hundreds remain\nuntouched\n\n\nBut inventors being inventors never give up\n\n\nI'm Lisa goodnight \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nThe body's need for fluid is often neglected until one feels\nthirsty\n\n\nBy the time you feel thirsty enough to reach for a drink you

foodcourts or restaurants people are more\nhealth conscious about what they eat but more importantly chefs are making an\neffort to create dishes that not only look good and taste great but are\nhealthy as well\n\n\nIt's generally acknowledged that much of what we eat is not really\ngood for us\n\n\nHome cooking is the exception\n\n\nFor health conscious people eating out does not necessarily mean\nunappetising or unattractive meals because restaurants' chefs have been\ncreating nutritious and appealing dishes with fresh natural ingredients herbs\nor spices\n\n\nSo healthy eating can be an enjoyable experience\n\n\nIt is established that Mediterranean diets reduce the risk of\ncancer because of the high consumption of vegetables and olive oil\n\n\nAlso for those watching their waistlines chef Clayton offers an\nalternative to the usual Mediterranean dish\n\n\nTo help customers with their choice this restaurant even carries\nthe calorie count on the menu\n\n\nFor starters try a refreshing mixed fruits salad of rock melon\npineapple star-fruit watermelon kiwi pink grape fruit and crispy lettuce\nserved with a chilled lemon grass and mint flavoured yogurt sauce\n\n\nTotal calorie content ninety-one\n\n\nFor mains the baked <unclear> word </unclear> tandoori with only\ntwo hundred and twenty calories is recommended\n\n\nIt's marinated with spice

disease\n\n\nSpices like the ones used in Indian cuisine contain no fat or\ncholesterol and bring out the flavour in foods\n\n\nThey also have medicinal values\n\n\nThe belief in cool and heaty foods is intrinsic in Chinese cuisine\n\n\nTonic soups and nutritious dishes with <unclear> word </unclear>\nproperties are served in this restaurant\n\n\nFor instance the double boiled fresh water fish

diners or the health\nconscious and taste and appearance are both important considerations so it's\nnever a bland experience\n\n\nChefs create an exciting array of flavours so that eating out and\neating healthily becomes a treat not a chore\n\n\nIt's time for a commercial break but when we come back we visit two\nof the top restaurants featured this week the Olea and the Blue Ginger\n\n\nThe Olea is an authentic Greek restaurant full of rustic charm and\nsunny hospitality\n\n\nIt's also made into the Wine and Dine top restaurants guide for\nthis year\n\n\nAnother restaurant that boast authenticity is the Blue Ginger a\nlocal Peranakan restaurant\n\n\nGreek food like the language is something that most people in\nSingapore know little about\n\n\nTo get acquainted with authentic Greek fare just troop on down to\nthe Olea deli and restaurant along Upper East Coast road\n\n\nIn a Greek <unclear> word </unclear> with rustic charm Greek\nornaments and melodious traditional music\n\n\nWith <unclear> word </unclear> walls and soft lighting the\natmosphere is cozy and inviting\n\n\nAl fresco dining is also available\n\n\nLet's start with a delectable selection of appetisers\n\n\nTry the platter of <unclear> word </unclear> and marinated octopus\nwith Olea signatured olive bread\n\n\nFor mains <unclear> word </unclear> is a Greek favourite made of\nlayers of thinly sliced eggplant and tomato the lasagne-liked creation is\nbaked with a tomato based <unclear> word </unclear> lamb filling\n\n\nOr try the lemon roast chicken with potatoes and the lamb <unclear>\nword </unclear> served with <unclear> word </unclear> pasta\n\n\nOlea's beverage list showcases several Greek table and desert wines\nand spirits\n\n\nStart with the <unclear> word </unclear> an <unclear> word\n</unclear> Greek national <unclear> word </unclear> and accompany your meal\nwith a bottle of the famous pine-centred <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nTo round off the meal try the potent Greek coffee or sample a slice\nof <unclear> word </unclear> a <unclear> word </unclear> crummy <unclear>\nword </unclear> or honey soaked <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nMaking <unclear> word </unclear> is very tedious process over forty\nlayers of <unclear> word </unclear> pastry has to be painstakingly laid by\nhand\n\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> aside you can take away deserts cheeses\nand other Greek goodies from the restaurant's deli counter\n\n\nThe Olea an introduction to a life long Greek affair\n\n\nHaving established a reputation for authentic Peranakan or\n<unclear> word </unclear> Chinese cuisine the first restaurant opened in\nTanjong Pagar three years ago\n\n\nDiners enjoy Peranakan home-styled cooking in a traditional\nPeranakan setting\n\n\nThe Blue Ginger at the Hereen redefines the same theme in a\nminimalist approach\n\n\nIn both restaurants you will find the whimsical paintings of local\nartist Martin Loh\n\n\nThe menu is the same for both Gingers showcasing <unclear> word\n</unclear> Lian's family renditions of traditional Nonya cuisine\n\n\nThey include the eggplant with samba toufu goreng and ayam pakang\nblue ginger a house specialty\n\n\nOther house favourites include spicy prawns and otar otar a spice\nfish paste in banana leaves and ikan asam <unclear> word </unclear> or fish\nin a sweet or spicy gravy and for desert the ever popular chendol\n\n\nPeranakan cuisine generally uses ingredients like ginger <unclear>\nword </unclear> garlic <unclear> word </unclear> asam <unclear> word\n</unclear> and lemon grass and a must for a Pernankan cuisine is the samba\nblachan\n\n\nWhen we took our cameras to the kitchen the chefs were preparing\n<unclear> word </unclear> or deep fried fillets of mackerel topped with a\nchili paste\n\n\nIf you can tear your attention away from the mouth watering dishes\nfor a moment you will notice that the restaurant is decorated with\ntraditional Peranakan lamps and mirrors\n\n\nThe cozy ambience and authentic Peranakan food make Blue Ginger one\nof Wine and Dine's choices of top restaurants in Singapore\n\n\nWe'll visit several more top restaurants in Singapore next week\n\n\nMeanwhile you can find them in Wine and Dine Singapore top\nrestaurants guide available at all bookstores\n\n\nNext for wine novices here are some tips on accessing wines\n\n\nWe will take a break but when we come back we sample the exotic\nflavours of Africa\n\n\n\n\n\nHi I'm Ai Lin and welcome back to Wine and Dine the guide to the\nbest in food and wine in Singapore and in Asia\n\n\nAfrica and Singapore might be oceans apart but the exotic flavours\nof Africa are now available on this sunny island\n\n\nWe find out why a Singaporean found the need to bring those\nflavours here \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nNew York July nineteen ninety-two\n\n\nWith the statue of liberty as backdrop the United States celebrated\nthe five hundredth anniversary of Christopher Columbus' dicovery of the new\nworld\n\n\nThere is a theory based on archaeological findings that the ancient\nChinese has set foot on American soil hundred of years before the famous\nEuropean explorer\n\n\nBut even if proven true it is likely to be only an academic point\n\n\nWith a grand multi-national sail pass complete with replicas of\nColumbus' ships eloquent speeches were made about the pursuit of liberty and\nhappiness\n\n\nAmerica congratulated herself for being a land of opportunities\n\n\nIndeed that was what drew a flood tide of people from the European\ncontinents since the last century\n\n\nAnd it was here at Alice island that they first tasted the air of\nfreedom and promise\n\n\nNow a museum the landmark building on the island was the point of\nimmigration for thousands who like Columbus took the voyage across the\nAtlantic ocean\n\n\nToday Alice island remains a symbol of hope the starting point in\nthe journey towards the American dream but not for the Chinese\n\n\nOn the Western edge of the continent where the Pacific ocean rushes\nto meet the shore are two other islands\n\n\nOne if Alcatraz the fortress prison that used to be home for the\nmost hardened criminals an island Americans are so familiar with\n\n\nNot too far away and not very well-known is Angel island which was\nfor the Chinese immigrants a nightmarish perverse cross between Alice and\nAlcatraz\n\n\nAngel island was the result of the exclusion act of eighteen\neighty-two\n\n\nIts sole purpose was to keep the Chinese and only them out of the\nUnited States\n\n\nCharged with causing unemployment and for being heathens America's\ndoors were to remain shut to the Chinese for over fifty years\n\n\nYou don't find too many laundries in San Franciso's Chinatown today\n\n\nPerhaps it's because few want the job which for so long has been\nassociated with a second class status\n\n\nBut in the long years of discrimination it was one of the few\noccupations opened to the Chinese\n\n\nAlthough the Chinese are not longer confined to working just within\nChinatown there are many who would still argue that discrimination persists\n\n\nAlfred Lee Director of the New York Chinatown Senior Citizens'\nAssociation is one of them\n\n\nHe and others here are preparing for a demonstration against the\nFederal government\n\n\nThe point of contention is the allocation of jobs and contracts to\nChinese in a multi-million housing project in the Chinatown area\n\n\nFurther demonstration had to be called understores for those who\nhave been left out the fact that America land of opportunities dishes out\nopportunities selectively\n\n\nBlatant discrimination may be gone but many charge that its subtle\noffsprings like the glass ceiling continue to frustrate Chinese American\nprofessionals in their attempt to move up the managerial ladder\n\n\nDoctor David Lam would have been one of them had he not struck out\non his own to set up a computer company in California Silicon Valley\n\n\nIn days past it was the stereotyping of Chinese that fed\ndiscrimination\n\n\nIn the nineties such stereotyping has taken an ironic twist\n\n\nBerkely University California the Asian presence mainly Chinese is\nunmistakable\n\n\nAmerica is calling the Chinese the model minority and often the\ndisproportionately high number of Chinese undergraduates in campuses like\nBerkely seem to support that tag\n\n\nBut the model minority label may be working against the Chinese\ntoday as much as negatives stereotypes in the past had done so\n\n\nThat misconception is not just confined to students and academic\nperformance\n\n\nProfessor Tian Chan Lim Chancellor of Berkely University\n\n\nEntertaining and amusing is this young black American's approach\nto earning a living\n\n\nMay seem his lot and that of others like him is what white America\nis more aware about\n\n\nFew Chinese even those desperately poor would do this and that\nperhaps is why their problems are never noticed\n\n\nThe nineteen ninety census report for the US indicate that\neighteen per cent of Chinese live below the poverty line higher than the\nfifteen per cent national average\n\n\nAnd it is in the old tenements of Chinatowns that they can be\nfound\n\n\nThe Fongs came to San Franciso from Canton about a year ago\n\n\nThe family of four has been living in this tiny room since they\narrived\n\n\nIt takes just two beds to cover almost all the floor space yet\nrent is US three hundred dollars a month\n\n\nThe Fongs are just scrapping by with the help of a relative who\nisn't very much better off himself\n\n\nThe tendency to forget about people like the Fongs and to focus\nonly on successful Chinese is something which is uncomfortable and worrying\neven for those who have scaled to the very top\n\n\nDespite the promise of freedom and welcome America has yet to\nfully accept the Chinese \n\n\nThat is exactly what many Chinese in America fear the jealousy\nprejudice and animosity that had led time and again to physical attacks from\nthe days of the very first Chinese immigrants It may not be mentioned so much\ntoday but the memory of one such attack on a young man named Vincent Chin is\ndeeply edged in the minds of many Chinese Americans It's still an uphill task\nfor ethnic Chinese in North America to gain acceptance but the onus is not\njust on white people Charles Pei Hwa served as a member of the civil rights\ncommission under former US President George Bush He believes that to be\naccepted by main-stream society Chinese Americans must first take the\ninitiative to redress a major short-coming the tendency to be parochial in\ntheir outlook But is that sentiment shared by most Chinese those busy making\na living? Across North America shops in Chinatowns do brisk business and the\nstreets bustle with life The influx of new immigrants from Asia has\ncontributed to that But it has also caused some resentment among those who\nstill see Chinese as outsiders But the recently arrived who make up the bulk\nof the Chinese population in North America don't seem to be too bothered with\nthat Many prefer literally to mine only their own business Most of the newly\narrived did not go through the harsh years of discrimination The toughest\npart in the road to acceptance had already been crossed And the days of being\noutcasts have faded in the distance But the journey is by no means over The\nchallenge for the Chinese in North America is to break away from being\noutsiders To integrate into their adopted countries and that may even be just\nas long a stretch to cover", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c31f7c87-b955-41bb-ba96-395f981abed6", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.731476+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nAt the crack of each dawn these Thai novice monks will follow\nan ancient Buddhist custom to seek that daily arms in the streets of Bangkok\n\n\nAnd just as early each day another group of Thais will be responding\nto an equally ancient but different practice Chinese callisthenics\n\n\nThese are ethnic Chinese who are either from or trace their roots to\nthe Chow Sun district in China's Kwantong province\n\n\nThey are Teochews the dialect group that most ethnic Chinese in\nThailand belong to\n\n\nAnd here at the spawling compound of the Teochew Association where\nthe steps of Taichi are still being practiced day after day\n\n\nIt appears that even in Thailand some ancient Chinese ways have\nresisted the forces of assimilation and acculturation\n\n\nThis temple was set up in memory of one of the early Chinese\npioneers Wu Chow Sun\n\n\nBesides being the traditional rallying point of the Teochews in\nBangkok the temple provides both young and old the spiritual relief of the\nMahayanar school of Buddhism a more eclectic Chinese version of the Federa\n<unclear> word </unclear> school which the Thai have adopted\n\n\nDespite the variation the commonality found in Buddhism was and\nstill is a powerful factor in the grafting together of the Thai and Chinese\ncommunities\n\n\nOnly some eight per cent of the population have retained a pure\nChinese bloodline and it's estimated that over forty per cent are of mixed\nparentage\n\n\nBut the passing of the older generation has distanced ancestral\nways\n\n\nThe practice of burial for instance has given way to the Thai\ncustom of cremation\n\n\nIt's just one indication of how rapidly most Chinese have\nassimilated\n\n\nFor the fuel towards assimilation is inexorable in Thailand and\nit's especially rapid amongst the middle-class Chinese\n\n\nChen Song Te came to Thailand when he was fourteen\n\n\nAlthough married to a Chinese nearly all his grand children are of\nmixed parentage Chen tries often to speak to them in Teochew but the boys can\nonly reply in Thai\n\n\nNearly all the goldsmith shops in Bangkok are owned by ethnic\nChinese and for that matter so are most other businesses\n\n\nBut it is accepted because there was a grafting of the two peoples\nand cultures into a collective Thai identity\n\n\nThe same however cannot be said of the Chinese elsewhere\n\n\nIn Indonesia ethnic Chinese makeup only one per cent of the\npopulation but are believed to control seventy per cent of the economy and\nthat fact often sits uncomfortably with the widespread poverty\n\n\nIt's just one reason why the Chinese here have worked hard to down\nplay and hide their Chineseness\n\n\nBut ethnicity has always been a sensitive issue in South-East Asia\n\n\nA country like Malaysia has been torn apart more than once by\nprimordial pulls of race and religion\n\n\nAnd often the unspoken problem lay with the perceived unwillingness\nof the ethnic Chinese to assimilate\n\n\nExalting mankind to share and respect the world\n\n\nThis couplet reflects well the hopes of those who now call\nAustralia home\n\n\nFor here one can find thousands who had come from Indo-China and\nSouth-East Asia\n\n\nMany are ethnic Chinese whose families had lived in Asia for\ngenerations but who have found it necessary to leave their first adopted\nhomes\n\n\nNot only is remigration changing physical landscapes it is also\naltering the pattern of assimilation and acculturation with racial and\ncultural diversity as a reality Western countries now have to come to terms\nwith the Asianisation of their societies\n\n\nThis has been given added momentum in recent years by another huge\noutpouring of ethnic Chinese who strangely enough are from a place where they\nare the majority\n\n\nThis used to be the entry point into Hong Kong for thousands of\nChinese immigrants\n\n\nEven today near this former railway station Hakka women from China\ncould be seen in their traditional costumes clinging stubbornly to the ways\nof the forebears\n\n\nVestiges of Chinese culture denounced and discarded by the\nCommunist mainland still have a place under Hong Kong skies\n\n\nThe traditional Chinese reverance for bloodline family continuity\nand ancestral blessings still hold sway\n\n\nAnd the Hong Kong people like other overseas Chinese have followed\nthe collective impulse to pre-empt the vagaries of fate invoking the gods of\ntheir fathers and asking as their ancestors did for health children and\nespecially success in life\n\n\nThe form today may have modern permutations but the substance\nremains\n\n\nIn this island of Chinese capitalism the search for economic\nsecurity has permeated all levels of society\n\n\nAnd so the impending return to China in nineteen ninety-seven has\nstacked the odds real or psychological against getting that security\n\n\nAnd thus the exodus from or some would even say the haemorrhaging\nof Hong Kong Canada has been receiving a massive infusion of the new Hong\nKong blood\n\n\nAlready some twenty-five per cent or more of Vancouver's population\nis Chinese and the figure is rising each day\n\n\nAberdeen Centre in the Vancouver's suburbs is a direct result of\nthe invasion of people from Hong Kong with full wallets\n\n\nNamed after the Aberdeen district in Hong Kong it is for all\npractical purposes a shopping mall transplanted from the British colony\n\n\nThe immigration counter here is a simple reminder of the growing\ninflux of ethnic Chinese from Hong Kong and Asia\n\n\nThe property market is buzzing along spurred by land-hungry Hong\nKong immigrants\n\n\nThis however has created some awkwardness\n\n\nDouglas Chang is a second-generation Canadian Chinese and the first\nethnic Chinese to be elected as a member of parliament\n\n\nThe Chang family trace their Canadian roots back to a Chinese\nmerchant who came to Vancouver in the last century\n\n\nThey see themselves as Canadians and are concerned that the Hong\nKong influx may undo the efforts of Chinese who have been here for\ngenerations\n\n\nMoney and numbers two advantages the newly arrived have which\nimmigrants in the past did not and this is also made them more resistant to\nacculturation in a white society\n\n\nDespite being a minority they have put in modern but Asian stamp on\nCanadian society just as ethnic Chinese in other countries have done\n\n\nBut this has also raised the issue of how the Chinese must now\nadapt to their homes\n\n\nIn November last year a conference was held in San Francisco to\ndiscuss the legal political and economic status of the overseas Chinese today\n\n\nAlthough acknowledging a common cultural heritage what was\nimportant was the emphasis given to the need for ethnic Chinese to place\ntheir sense of belonging in the countries they now find themselves\n\n\nMichael Wu would not consider himself a China man\n\n\nBut he was the one running for the office of Mayor of Los Angeles\nlast month\n\n\nAlthough unsuccessful Wu's efforts have continued the process of\nweaving an Asian motiff into the fabric of American politics\n\n\nDuring the early stages of the campaign Wu whose grandfather served\nunder doctor Soon Yat Sen shared his views on the challenges facing a\nChinese-American politician like himself\n\n\nBroadway New York the cultural capital of America on the east coast\n\n\nAs in the political arena the grafting of Asian elements into\nAmerican culture has begun\n\n\nAlthough opportunities for Asians are still paltry at least one\nBroadway entertainer is optimistic that the tide will soon turn\n\n\nHe is Chris Phillips better known to his Asian fans as Fei Xiang\n\n\nFor many ethnic Chinese all over the world finding the place in the\nnew homes has made it necessary for them at one time or another to define\nthemselves and that definition can often be coloured by their ancient roots\n\n\nBut with the impending raise of East Asia especially China and the\ndawn of the Pacific century will there be light or shadow cast on those who\nstill seek to retain their ancient Chinese roots \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nNew buildings are changing the face of Killiney

{"text": "<$A> \n\nFalls creak Vancouver\n\n\nSome a hundred years ago the poor Chinese immigrants who lived in\nmake-shift shelters here were often the objects of scorn and physical abuse\n\n\nOne particularly notorious attack involved two Chinamen tied\ntogether by their pig-tails\n\n\nThey were thrown into the water for no reason other than they were\nChinese\n\n\nIn the right twist of history the whole stretch of the far bank\ntoday belongs to and it's being developed by a Chinese Hong Kong billionaire\nLee Kah Shing\n\n\nAnd overseeing the project is his Chinese Canadian associate Stanley\nKwok\n\n\nThis is just one example of the growing economic clout of ethnic\nChinese a phenomenon that stems from and resonates with an East-Asia in\nascendance\n\n\nAnd that resonance especially with China is something that those who\ncalled themselves the dragon descendants have always found hard to ignore\n\n\nThe Chinese Cultural Centre in Vancouver acts very much like the\ncentennial in the preservation of the ancient Chinese heritage\n\n\nWith that in mind one area in particular has been accorded high\npriority\n\n\nThese children have been sent here by parents who wish to see them\nretain the use of their mother tongue\n\n\nThe same intent also motivates others in the United States\n\n\nMany parents are uncomfortable with the fact that their children\nare fast losing their competence in the Chinese language\n\n\nIn the Chinese mind knowing the language is seen as crucial to the\ntapping of the Chinese cultural wellspring and integral to the definition of\nbeing Chinese\n\n\nIn days past that definition went even further to include a\npolitical identification with China\n\n\nOverseas Chinese money and support were instrumental in helping\ndoctor Sun Yat Sen overthrow the Manchu dynasty and for that contribution\ndoctor Soon was to call them the mother of the revolution\n\n\nEvidence of such close links in the past can still be seen today\n\n\nMany overseas Chinese continued to support their ancestral homeland\nlong after doctor Soon's death\n\n\nThe Japanese invasion of China in brutal treatment of civilians\nbetween nineteen thirty-seven to nineteen forty-five saw not only a\ntremendous outpouring of money for China's war effort but also arouse intense\nanimosity towards Japan China's enemy became the overseas Chinese as well\n\n\nBut World War Two also brought about a change in the relationship\nbetween ethnic Chinese in America and China\n\n\nHaving fought for the United States they had showed clearly whether\nallegiance and sense of belonging laid\n\n\nThey had become Americans But same experience were shared by those\nwho fought on Canada's side\n\n\nDouglas Chang who was decorated for bravery in action remembers\n\n\nBut the unfolding drama in China continued to impact the ethnic\nChinese elsewhere especially those in South-East Asia\n\n\nAt first the fact that China had finally stood up after years of\nhumilation and turmoil was celebrated not only by those of the mainland but\nalso by the overseas Chinese\n\n\nThe celebration however was short-lived and any fond hope of\nreturning of returning to China was soon dashed by a confluent of factors\n\n\nThat question was to put thousands in a terrible fix\n\n\nIn Indonesia the involvement of some ethnic Chinese in the abortive\nCommunist coup of nineteen sixty-five implicated entire communities\n\n\nIn an atmosphere of turmoil and suspicion many innocent lives were\nlost\n\n\nThat experience was a sombre reminder that any affiliation to China\neven cultural was easily misconstrued and harshly rewarded\n\n\nWith Mao's cultural revolution links between ethnic Chinese in\nChina received a further blow\n\n\nSouth-East Asia weary about any spill-over to their shores slammed\ntheir doors shut to China\n\n\nThe change only came in nineteen seventy-nine when Teng Xiao Ping\nflung China's doors open\n\n\nWith a billion people hungry for trade and product links with China\nsuddenly became an advantage\n\n\nOne of those who responded to that pull is the Chairman of\nSingapore's United Overseas Bank Wee Chor Yeow Convinced that China offered\nhuge opportunities after a trip there in nineteen seventy-nine\n\n\nWee proceeded with his investments capitalising on the linkages\nthat ethnic Chinese enjoy\n\n\nThe empathy that ethnic Chinese abroad have for China and her ways\nhave made it easier for them to penetrate the huge market\n\n\nThis however has led some to question the motives of those who are\ndoing business with the mainland\n\n\nA misconception ethnic Chinese will like to correct\n\n\nBy investing in China ethnic Chinese abroad have again renewed ties\nwith their ancestral homeland\n\n\nBut although forged by business rather than politics the\nre-establishing of such ties will still have to be managed carefully\n\n\nThe renewal of ties with China is not initiated solely by the\nethnic Chinese abroad\n\n\nChina is also actively seeking to tap their resources and expertise\n\n\nIt is for this reason that the leaders of Singapore whose efforts\nhave contributed to the city state's economic prosperity are much sought\nafter visitors\n\n\nBut just how significant is the role played by ethnic Chinese\nabroad in transforming China\n\n\nThe Senior Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew\n\n\nSo in many ways a China that is doing well will also free the\nethnic Chinese abroad from the psychological stigma of being off-shoots of a\nfailed civilization\n\n\nNot only that a China plugged into the modern world would also be\ninstrumental in shifting the economic centre of gravity to East Asia\n\n\nBut will China disappoint by failing again\n\n\nThe promise of an East Asian renaissance however goes beyond its\nanticipated economic preeminence in the next century\n\n\nMany believe that there is also much to rediscover in the Chinese\nheritage so that tomorrow's progress will not be devoid of yesterday's wisdom\n\n\nAnd here ethnic Chinese as inheritors of an ancient culture have\nmuch to hold on to and share\n\n\nBut are ancient Chinese values relevant to modern living\n\n\nIn the West the increasing number of old folks living alone or in\nhomes is a reality that contradicts the fundamental Chinese ideal of filial\npiety and respect for elders\n\n\nThis old man is seeing his family for the first time in over ten\nyears\n\n\nHe had chosen to stay behind in San Francisco when they emigrated\nto Australia\n\n\nSituations like these are not confined to Western societies\n\n\nThe pressures that modernisation brings are felt on a global level\nand the ethnic Chinese are not spared\n\n\nDoes this mean that the Chinese tradition is also fast becoming\nirrelevant in today's ground\n\n\nIn many ways the story of the overseas Chinese ends when the ethnic\nChinese abroad embrace the nationalities of their countries\n\n\nThese children for example may not consider themselves as overseas\nChinese and rightly so because they are Americans\n\n\nBut they and others like them will inherit a tradition that had\nguided their parents and the Chinese people for thousand of years\n\n\nSo will they discard that heritage in a rapidly changing world or\nwill they try to harmonise the ancient wisdom found in it with the demands of\nmodernisation\n\n\nTheir choice will determine what is to be written in the epilogue\nof the story of the overseas Chinese \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nHandphones you just can't leave home without it\n\n\nThat's what hundred and twenty thousand Singaporeans say and for\nJapanese models which are forty per cent of this market prices look set to\nincrease\n\n\nWhether prices for handphones will go up will depend much on where\nthe Yen is heading\n\n\nIn the past six months the Yen rose by more than twelve per cent\nagainst the Sing dollar\n\n\nSo far most brands including Sony Sharp Pioneer have taken a hard\nbash from the Yen's rise\n\n\nIn the past month prices of these Japanese goods have risen by\nthree to ten per cent\n\n\nThe full twelve per cent rise in the Yen may not be reflected on\ntheir price tags yet but for the four wheelers the price hike is beyond the\nfull rise of the Yen\n\n\nThe OMV or open market value of the car includes the insurance\nfreight charges customs uplift which is a form of tax on the car and their\ninvoice cost which is affected by the currency movements\n\n\nTake a family car the Honda Civic one point six ESI manual\ntransmission\n\n\nSix months back the OMV was seventeen thousand dollars\n\n\nToday with the Yen factor it's at twenty thousand dollars an\nincrease of three thousand\n\n\nWith custom duties and the additional registration fee or ARF of\nhundred and ninety-five per cent the three thousand increase is further\ncompounded to nearly nine thousand dollars\n\n\nAnd these price increases have been largely borne by car buyers\n\n\nAcross the board other Japanese cars like Mitsubishi Nissan Toyota\nhave all increased their prices with the rise of the Yen\n\n\nAnd some businessmen say that their profit margins have been\nsqueezed as they have to bear part of the Yen's rise\n\n\nAlthough recent political upheaval in Japan has sent the Yen\nsliding a little some say this may just be a temporary breather\n\n\nWith the pressure to keep the Yen strong some people hope for a\nreplay of what took place in the eighties when the rising Yen then led to a\nsurge of Japanese investments here\n\n\nThe Yen factor today does not call for a celebration here or in\nJapan\n\n\nKeeping watch on the Yen and waiting for the sun to rise again is\nnow just part of the Japanese way of life \n\n\n\n<$C> \n\nIt was a hot day but these people were undaunted\n\n\nSome have queued for more than twelve hours for the chance to buy a\nchoice unit at Parc Oasis a new condo development in Jurong East\n\n\nThe apartments were snapped up as if they were free\n\n\nBuyers were willing to pay more than four hundred thousands dollars\nfor each unit\n\n\nThat was a month ago\n\n\nToday buyers are willing to pay up to fifty thousand dollars more\nin the resale market\n\n\nNot surprising new condos in the outlying Nort-West North and\nNorth-East of the island went like hot cakes last year\n\n\nProjects like Hue Park Bishan Park and Tanah Merah were sold within\ndays\n\n\nThe Tanah Merah for example\n\n\nMore than thirty per cent of the buyers were upgraders from the\nnearby HDB towns\n\n\nTo cater to this niche market most of the properties are priced in\nthe mid level range with different locations commanding different prices\n\n\nBut on average condos in the North-West like Upper Bukit Timah cost\nten per cent more than the other two regions\n\n\nThey're popular with expatriates working in the nearby Jurong\nIndustrial estate\n\n\nRents in this region are also one to two per cent higher\n\n\nBut compared to the prime districts East and West Coast rents in\noutlying areas are as attractive\n\n\nBut not so for Anthony Fong\n\n\nHe made good capital gains rather quickly\n\n\nThis Dairy Farm apartment was bought last year for six hundred\nthousand\n\n\nToday Anthony can sell it for almost a million\n\n\nLike Dairy Farm prices of condos in the North-West tend to rise\nfaster and higher than those in the other regions half a per cent higher than\nthe North and two per cent more than the North-East\n\n\nEven with the record two thousand condo units to be launched in\nthe next two years prices in Upper Bukit Timah are unlikely to fall\n\n\nAnother up and coming area in the North-West is Woodlands the\nfuture business and leisure hub in the North\n\n\nTo be built within the next ten years the Woodlands regional\ncentre will have entertainment joints cinemas and offices\n\n\nBy nineteen ninety-six the MRT will be completed and the American\nSchool will have relocated here\n\n\nThese developments will benefit the eight hundred units of new\ncondos and houses along Woodlands Avenue one but that's in two years' time\n\n\nMeanwhile the more established areas like Yishun and Yio Chu Kang\nare drawing the crowds\n\n\nThe next most popular region after the North-West condos like\nBullion Park cost about four hundred dollars per square foot\n\n\nBut the closer they are to the city in Bishan and Ang Mo Kio the\nhigher the price and the greater the demand\n\n\nAnother popular area is the North-East\n\n\nAlong Upper Changi road Loyang and Pasir Ris\n\n\nThese may not be near the city but they are cheaper than the North\nand North-West \n\n\nThe main attraction however is its proximity to the East Coast\nand the surrounding recreation clubs In addition homebuyers are also wooed by\nplans to transform nearby Tampines into another business regional centre\nDevelopers are optimistic about the potential of this area as can be seen\nfrom the number of condos sprouting up especially along Upper Changi road So\nfar five hundred and twenty units have already been matketed and another one\nthousand four hundred will be launched in the next two years A few streets\naway in Simei a new condo will hit the market in September Hailed as the\nlargest development in Singapore more than one thousand two hundred units\nwill be up for sale This will bring the total number of condos in the\nNorth-East to a staggering two thousand nine hundred Another two thousand six\nhundred is expected in the North-West and more than eight hundred in the\nNorth The total supply coming on stream is an overwhelming six thousand four\nhundred units in the next two years So it seems there's no need for scenes\nlike these anymore With

{"text": "<$A> \n\nSight many of us take it for granted until something happens\n\n\nWhat Balachanda didn't know was that he had developed carytic conus\na condition where his cornea had become uneven\n\n\nBalachanda is just one of fifty people every year who are afflicted\nwith cornea disease\n\n\nThe cornea is a transparent skin covering the eye\n\n\nWhen it's diseased vision is blocked\n\n\nThe only hope is a transplant where the old cornea is removed and\nreplaced by a new cornea\n\n\nIt is a simple operation but difficult to perform simply because of\na lack of donor corneas\n\n\nBecause of the shortage Balachanda had to get by the first year on\nspecial contact lenses instead\n\n\nEach pair cost him seven hundred dollars\n\n\nFinally last June nearly two and a half years after his problem\nbegan Balachanda received the call to say that a donor cornea was available\n\n\nHe had the operation the very next day and today relies on that eye\nwhich now has almost perfect vision\n\n\nBut his problem isn't totally over because only one eye is clear he\nhas problem balancing his vision in both eyes\n\n\nHe now hopes that the same operation can be carried out again this\ntime to correct the other eye\n\n\nAnd Bala isn't the only one Every year over a hundred and fifty\npeople are on a waiting list for the operation\n\n\nThe actual number is even higher if you take into account those\nwaiting at private hospitals\n\n\nDoctors say we need to triple our present number of donors in order\nto meet our needs\n\n\nAt the moment most of the corneas available are imported\n\n\nEach week the Singapore National Eye Centre places an order for two\ndonor corneas from Sri Lanka Since nineteen sixty-four Singapore has received\nbetween three and four hundred corneas from the country the world's largest\ncornea donor\n\n\nIt is six am and a cornea ordered last week has just arrived from\nSri Lanka\n\n\nIt comes packed in a special fluid which can preserve it for up to\nfive days\n\n\nBy the time it arrives it is at least two days old and things have\nto move fast to avoid any more delay\n\n\nBy nine am the eye is collected and rushed to the hospital\n\n\nThere it's carefully store in the freezer at below four degrees\n\n\nFour hours later tests are done on the eye\n\n\nBy the next morning the operation is underway\n\n\nThe lucky recipient is a seventy year old man who's already blind\nin one eye The operation is to try save the other\n\n\nDuring the operation the donor cornea is measured and cut to size\nWithin the hour it is sown on\n\n\nThis operation is the only hope for the patient\n\n\nIf successful it could mean restoring vision to the eye He has\nwaited over six months for this operation\n\n\nGetting a healthy cornea is difficult In fact sometimes corneas are\nrejected on arrival\n\n\nIn some cases the quality was in doubt but used anyway because the\npatient could not afford to wait any longer\n\n\nLast year the Singapore General Hospital stop using corneas from\nSri Lanka for a period of time for fear of aids and hepatitis infection\n\n\nDoctors told us that the best solution would be to use local\ncorneas\n\n\nThis way there'll be greater control over their quality \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nGood local fare is usually found only at hawker centres\n\n\nProbably the most popular among locals and tourists alike is the\nNewton food centre\n\n\nOpen twenty-four hours a day Newton is famous for its good food and\nambience\n\n\nBut until recently the eating place was also notorious for some of\nSingapore's most aggressive store holders\n\n\nTheir strong arm tactics ended when two previous stall tenants had\ntheir operating licences revoked for over-charging and harassing customers\n\n\nBidding for the vacant stores quickly took place and the results\nraised eye-brows throughout Singapore\n\n\nWhile the monthly rental at Newton once averaged two hundred\ndollars stall number fifty-six's new tenant bid a whopping fifteen thousand\nfive hundred dollars\n\n\nThe successful bid for stall number sixty amounted to ten thousand\none hundred and sixty-eight dollars Many existing Newton stall holders don't\nbelieve the new tenants can survive\n\n\nInsiders say some stores can earn up to three thousand dollars a\nday as Newton remain possibly the best location for hawkers\n\n\nAnd the high-roller bidders with their big-time bets are gambling\non that knowledge\n\n\nOne of them is the owner of a well-known roast duck chain of eight\noutlets located throughout Singapore\n\n\nHe is Johnson Lock and his is a rag-to-riches story\n\n\nLock who started at fourteen as a kitchen helper earning two\ndollars a day was promoted to an assistant cook before compulsory stint in\nthe army\n\n\nAfter that he gave cooking lessons at a community centre\n\n\nHe then ventured into the chicken-rice business but somehow\nfigured out that there was more money in roasted ducks\n\n\nWhile its competitors then sold each duck for twenty to thirty\ndollars he shrewdly slashed the price to thirteen dollars a duck\n\n\nThirteen dollars a duck was and still is possible because Lock\ndoesn't need to go through a middleman\n\n\nHe owns a factory that supplies roasted ducks directly to his\noutlets While competitors charge seasonal prices Lock's price is fixed at\nthirteen dollars a duck\n\n\nHis no nonsense pricing has allowed business volume to grow\ndramatically\n\n\nToday he sells about thirty thousand ducks a month\n\n\nLock is confident that his Newton stall rent of ten thousand one\nhundred and sixty-eight dollars will be covered\n\n\nAt thirteen dollars a duck he would need to sell only forty ducks a\nday to break even\n\n\nBut Lock is confident that the crowd at Newton will be able to\nbring him profits\n\n\nBy one estimate if Lock does manage to sell two hundred ducks a day\njust at Newton he could gross around two thousand six hundred dollars a day\nor about eighty thousand dollars a month\n\n\nHis rental would then be more than well covered\n\n\nSo rental doesn't seem to be the major issue in Johnson Lock's\nbusiness\n\n\nRather his main problem which all hawkers are facing is the\nshortage of labour\n\n\nAlthough he pays his workers a minimum of one thousand two hundred\ndollars a month plus yearly bonuses for a six day week finding helpers has\nproven difficult\n\n\nOpening the Newton stall may mean closing down one of his other\noutlets to reallocate his work force\n\n\nThe shortage of labour in Singapore limits Lock's expansion plans\nhere so he's looking at Malaysia for the future\n\n\nBut in the meanwhile Lock is looking forward to the opening of his\nnew store at Newton on the second of March\n\n\nWhether he makes money there remains to be seen but the ambition\nand determination driving him there's a good chance he will succeed \n\n\n\n<$C> \n\nOur growth in 1986 is a small 19 per cent\n\n\nHalf the economy manufacturing transport and communications - has\ndone well\n\n\nThe other half commerce financial and business services and\nconstruction remains depressed\n\n\nThe economy is recovering because we took decisive measures to\ntackle our economic problems directly\n\n\nWe reduced business costs including cutting taxes and employers'\nCPF contributions and restrained wage increases\n\n\nOur workers and trade unions have supported these actions\n\n\nBy not flinching from painful policies Singaporeans have spared\nthemselves higher inflation and a longer recession\n\n\nThe soft option would have been for no reduction in employers' CPF\ncontributions no wage restraint minor cost-cutting\n\n\nInstead we would have had to accept a drop in the exchange rate of\nthe Singapore dollar as the economy continued to weaken and the foreign\nexchange markets pushed the Singapore dollar down\n\n\nThe drop would have needed to be sizable to achieve the equivalent\nof a 15 per cent reduction in employers' CPF contributions\n\n\nThis would have led to a high inflation rate of more than 10 per\ncent because Singapore imports its food oil nearly all manufactured and\nsemi-manufactured products\n\n\nThen workers' pay and CPF would have appeared the same or even more\nbut would have been worth less in purchasing power\n\n\nInstead our inflation rate was less than zero: - 14 per cent that\nis each Singapore dollar bought slightly more in 1986 than in 1985\n\n\nBy dealing with the problem head on we have simplified and\nshortened the process of adjusting our economy and have avoided inflation\n\n\nExternal factors like the appreciation of the Yen have helped\n\n\nBut we would have not been able to take advantage of these\nfavourable developments if we had not set our house in order\n\n\nIf Singapore had not become more competitive Japanese companies\nlooking for an external location because of a higher Yen would have skipped\nSingapore\n\n\nThe forecast for the region is continued low commodity prices and\ntherefore continued slow growth\n\n\nThose sectors of the Singapore economy that are linked to the\nregion will not perform well\n\n\nOur growth rate in 1987 is expected to be only 3-4 per cent\n\n\nThis is not only less than the 6-8 per cent projected for the other\nnewly industrialising Countries NICs it is also below our own estimated\nlong-term growth rate of 4-6 per cent\n\n\nIt shows that our recovery is not complete\n\n\nMinistry of Trade & Industry MTI calculations show that although we\nhave improved in competitiveness against the other NICs we have not fully\nrecovered the competitiveness we enjoyed against them before our high wage\nincreases in 1980-83\n\n\nWe need at least one more year of high productivity growth and wage\nrestraint to close the gap\n\n\nIf their wages go up this year whilst we stay put the gap will\nnarrow\n\n\nAt the same time we must press on with reforming our wage payment\nsystem\n\n\nIn a next recession and there will inevitably be a next one we are\nunlikely to have large employers' CPF contributions to cut back\n\n\nAt present we have in-built rigidities in our wage structure\n\n\nThe NWC has endorsed its Subcommittee Report on Wage Reform\n\n\nTwenty-three large local companies and MNCs as well as the banking\nand insurance groups are already discussing these ideas with their unions\n\n\nCompanies who have not started should do so\n\n\nThe objectives are to build flexibility into our wage system and to\nlink workers' rewards to  productivity growth  performance of the\nfirm and  performance of the individual\n\n\nFlexibility will increase the survival capacity of companies\n\n\nIt is a safety margin for workers so that they can keep their jobs\nwhen companies fare poorly\n\n\nIf they do this in a next recession management can reduce costs\nrather than output by cutting the flexible component of wages\n\n\nSo we can recover from the recession more quickly with fewer\nworkers retrenched\n\n\nMy younger colleagues have diagnosed our economic problems\n\n\nThey decided on cost-cutting and wage restraint to attract new\ninvestments and to create a favourable climate for a total business centre\n\n\nUnion leaders have persuaded and convinced the workers to back\nthis strategy And our economy is on the mend\n\n\nBut the more difficult part will come next year\n\n\nAlthough MTI forecasts 3-4 per cent growth commerce financial and\nbusiness services and construction are not expected to rebound and growth\nwill have to come from manufacturing and transport & communications\n\n\nTo reach a figure of four per cent for the economy as a whole\nthese two sectors manufacturing and transport and communications will have to\ngrow by eight per cent a high target achievable only if we keep costs down\nand productivity up\n\n\nTherefore to improve the overall performance of the economy\nmanufacturing and transport and communications workers will have to moderate\ntheir wage expectations\n\n\nWorkers will feel the pick up by early 1987 when the NWC will be\nconsidering the 1987 recommendations\n\n\nFactories will work more overtime and hire more workers\n\n\nWorkers will read of better profits in company reports the result\nof last year's cost-cutting\n\n\nThey will be tempted to heed the good news and to press for a wage\nincrease\n\n\nWith output training if employers in the manufacturing sector\nrelent and become overgenerous they will become the pace setter \n\n\nThen wages in other sectors will be forced to follow suit\nregardless of their ability to pay\n\n\nIf this happen our entire strategy for economic recovery will be\njeopardized The test for our younger generation of Singaporean leaders and\nworkers is whether they can put long-term interests ahead of short-term gains\nand by demonstrating wage-restraint discipline win the confidence

{"text": "<$A> \n\n1  At the Teachers' Day Rally last September Prime Minister Goh\nChok Tong outlined the challenges to our education system\n\n\nA key imperative was National Education\n\n\nMany Singaporeans especially pupils and younger Singaporeans knew\nlittle of our recent history\n\n\nThey did not know how we became an independent nation how we\ntriumphed against long odds or how today's peaceful and prosperous Singapore\ncame about\n\n\n2   This ignorance will hinder our effort to develop a shared sense\nof nationhood\n\n\nWe will not acquire the right instincts to bond together as one\nnation or maintain the will to survive and prosper in an uncertain world For\nSingapore to thrive beyond the founder generation we must systematically\ntransmit these instincts and attitudes to succeeding cohorts\n\n\nThrough National Education we must make these instincts and\nattitudes part of the cultural DNA which makes us Singaporeans\n\n\n3  The Prime Minister set up a committee chaired by Mr Lim Siong Guan\nto study how to introduce National Education into our education system\n\n\nThe Committee has worked out a plan to do so\n\n\nTo take the next step forward we need the full commitment of every\nteacher and principal\n\n\nNational Education is not just a book subject\n\n\nIt must appeal to both heart and mind\n\n\nUnless you are personally convinced of its importance committed to\nthe cause and have the knowledge and passion to teach National Education\ncompetently and whole-heartedly the plan will fail\n\n\n Lessons from Other Countries \n\n\n4   Singaporeans are not unique in needing National Education\n\n\nOther countries take National Education as a matter of course\n\n\nJapan is a tightly-knit cohesive and group-oriented society with a\nlong history and a strong sense of unique identity\n\n\nYet Japanese schools start early to teach pupils Japanese culture\nvalues history and geography and even the politics and economics of Japan\n\n\nAs pupils get older they also learn about the cultures and\nhistories of other countries\n\n\nIn so doing they understand even better what makes them uniquely\nJapanese\n\n\n5  Japanese schools go to great lengths to instill group instincts\nand a sense that every student is an equal member of the group\n\n\nThey have strict regulations on school uniforms school bags and\nshoes\n\n\nStudents are grouped into teams called 'hans'\n\n\nMembers of each han play together and eat together\n\n\nThey take turns to perform specific responsibilities whether it is\nthe daily cleaning of school premises or serving lunch\n\n\nAcademically stronger students are expected to help their weaker\nfriends\n\n\nThose who do not are ostracised\n\n\nStudents organise the school sports day themselves\n\n\nCompetition is based mainly on team events there are few or no\nindividual events\n\n\nAll students participate including those with disabilities\n\n\n6  Japanese schools do all this not because they believe that all\nstudents are the same in every respect or have identical abilities\n\n\nBut they want every student to be equally valued as a member of the\ngroup recognised for his strengths and for what he can contribute to the\ngroup And so it goes for Japanese society\n\n\n7  In US schools every child is taught the American heritage George\nWashington the Declaration of Independence the US Constitution the Civil War\nand the Civil Rights movement\n\n\nStudents take part in community service\n\n\nLearning to be a responsible citizen begins young\n\n\nIt is a deliberate inculcating of American political and social\nvalues and ideals to ensure the next generation grows up with these ideas\ndeeply ingrained\n\n\nIt is a process of indoctrination like any other no less so because\nthe children are brought up to cherish American values of individual liberty\n\n\nAnd it is so successful that many Americans are completely\nconvinced that American values are universal values of mankind\n\n\n8  If countries like Japan and the US with long histories and deep\nroots have found it essential to pass on national instincts systematically\nfrom generation to generation all the more Singapore a young country barely\none generation old must make a concerted effort to imbue the right values and\ninstincts in the psyche of our young\n\n\n Objectives Of National Education \n\n\n9  National Education aims to develop national cohesion the instinct\nfor survival and confidence in our future\n\n\nWe cannot offer our next generation any fixed formula for success\nor even any set goals in life\n\n\nThey will face new circumstances and problems\n\n\nThey will need to think through and work out their own solutions\n\n\nBut we must equip them with the basic attitudes values and\ninstincts which make them Singaporeans\n\n\nThis is the common culture that will give them a shared perception\nof life and draw them closer together as one people when confronted with\nserious problems\n\n\nThis will give them a well-founded faith in the country's future\nThis is the DNA to be passed from one generation to the next\n\n\n10  There are four elements to achieving this objective\n\n\n11  First we must foster in our young a sense of identity pride and\nself-respect as Singaporeans\n\n\nThis will strengthen their emotional attachment to the nation and\ntheir sense of rootedness\n\n\nWe are proud of our country\n\n\nWe are proud of what we have achieved together - our economic\nprogress our clean and green environment our open and clean system of\ngovernment our way of life\n\n\nWe are proud that each of us in his or her own way contributes to\nSingapore's success\n\n\n12  But success must not lead to hubris We must never be\nover-bearing or arrogant or look down on people from other countries\n\n\nWe do not have all the answers for ourselves much less for other\ncountries\n\n\nBut neither have we any reason to be ashamed to say I am a\nSingaporean\n\n\nIn fact quite the contrary\n\n\n13  Second our young must know the Singapore Story how Singapore\nsucceeded against the odds to become a nation\n\n\nNational Education is not an abstract sermon on general principles\nof nationhood\n\n\nIt is to do with a special story our story It is the story of\nSingapore how we came to be one nation\n\n\nWe did not start off with this goal or even as one people Nobody\nimagined this would be the outcome\n\n\n14  As a British colony from 1942 to 1945 for 3 and frac12 years of\nthe Japanese Occupation we suffered a traumatic experience of cruelty\nbrutality hunger and deprivation\n\n\nWe lived through the post-war years of Communist-inspired unrest\nand upheaval\n\n\nWe then joined with the Federation of Malaya to form Malaysia\n\n\nDespite pressure and intimidation we stood firm in Malaysia against\nthe communalists\n\n\nThe issue was a fundamental one equal basic rights and\nopportunities for all Malaysian citizens under the Malaysian Constitution and\nno special rights for anyone in the State of Singapore on the basis of race\nlanguage and religion as was agreed in the State Constitution of Singapore\n\n\nAs a result we suddenly found ourselves out on our own as an\nindependent country with few means to make a living or defend ourselves\n\n\nYet we developed our economy built up the SAF educated and housed\nour people got them to work together and gradually became one nation\n\n\nYear by year we transformed Singapore into what it is today\n\n\n15  Knowing this history is part of being a Singaporean\n\n\nIt is the back-drop which makes sense of our present\n\n\nIt shows what external dangers to watch out for and where our\ndomestic fault lines lie\n\n\nIt explains what we stand for and believe in and why we think and\nact the way we do\n\n\nIt gives us confidence that even when the odds look daunting with\ndetermination and effort we will prevail\n\n\n16  Thirdly our young must understand Singapore's unique challenges\nconstraints and vulnerabilities which make us different from other countries\nSingapore is not as other countries\n\n\nWe will always be small we will always worry about our water supply\nwe will always have to work harder and do better than other countries\n\n\nThat is the hand which geography and history have dealt us\n\n\nOverall it is not a bad hand nor have we played it badly\n\n\nWe have compensated for these constraints by being more resolute\nand resourceful more efficient and productive and quicker and nimbler than\nother countries which are better endowed and have larger margins for error\n\n\nAnd we have been so successful that sometimes we forget that the\nunderlying realities endure and have not gone away\n\n\nSingaporeans need to understand these realities to work together\nand support the policies that are necessary to deal with them\n\n\n17  Knowing our constraints should make us more determined to\novercome them\n\n\nIt is no cause for despair We overcame more severe difficulties in\nour first years of nationhood with far fewer resources and in more dire\ncircumstances\n\n\nWe are much better placed to tackle them now\n\n\n18  Finally we must instill in our young the core values of our way\nof life and the will to prevail that ensure our continued success and well\nbeing\n\n\nOur core values include the system of meritocracy which guarantees\nfair and full opportunities for all multi-racial and multi-religious harmony\nand honest and competent government working for the long-term interests of\nall Singaporeans\n\n\nWe often take these for granted because things have been this way\nin Singapore for a long time\n\n\nBut not new citizens who often come with fresh direct experience of\nvery different societies\n\n\nPupils must learn to treasure and uphold these social and political\nvalues If we ever lose them Singapore will quickly become a very different\nplace\n\n\n Strategies \n\n\n19  We need to develop national instincts among pupils at all levels\n\n\nNational Education will begin in schools and continue in\npost-secondary and tertiary institutions\n\n\nAfter ten to fifteen years of education all students should know\nthe facts about Singapore and feel attached to Singapore their best home\n\n\nThose likely to go on to play leadership roles later should at\nleast have had some preliminary preparation for their responsibilities\n\n\nWe will achieve this through both the formal and informal curricula\n\n\n Formal Curriculum \n\n\n20  We will introduce National Education content across the formal\ncurriculum\n\n\nWe can do more of this in some subjects than others\n\n\nThe main subjects will be Social Studies and Civics and Moral\nEducation   at the primary level History Geography and CME at secondary\nlevel and the General Paper and CME at the Junior Colleges\n\n\nIn addition Literature and the languages can also be used \nSubjects at Primary level \n\n\n21   In primary schools we will start teaching Social Studies\nearlier beginning from Primary 1 instead of Primary 4 Social Studies will\ncomplement Civics and Moral Education\n\n\nCME will emphasise teaching of values and correct individual\nbehaviour while Social Studies will give pupils an understanding of Singapore\nsociety\n\n\n22  Pupils must start early to learn about the society around them\nto feel a sense of belonging to family school and community to befriend and\naccept pupils of all races and to develop a simple unabashed pride in\nSingapore\n\n\nThey recite the pledge sing Majullah Singapura and recognise our\nflag Later they will learn the meaning of the crescent and five stars But\nlong before that when they see the helicopter flying past with the state flag\non National Day they should sense that it is a very special occasion\n\n\n Subjects at Secondary level \n\n\n23  At secondary level students currently learn the history of our\nindependence period only in Secondary 1\n\n\nThe 'O' level History syllabus stops in 1963 which perversely\nomits the vital period leading to our independence\n\n\nWe will extend the 'O' level History syllabus for Singapore to\n1971 The period of Merger Separation and the early years of independence will\nalso be taught in Secondary 2 instead of Secondary 1 so that the students\nwill be a little more mature and appreciate better what was at stake\n\n\n24   At the upper secondary level we will develop a new Social\nStudies subject\n\n\nIt will cover issues central to Singapore's survival and success\nour principles of governance the strategies that have brought Singapore here\nthe role of key institutions like the SAF HDB CPF EDB and NTUC and our future\nchallenges \n\n\nIt will use examples from other countries to explain what works\nand what fails and derive lessons for Singapore Subjects at the JC level 25\nIn the junior colleges students should start to learn what leadership\ninvolves and to develop a commitment to serve society Through the General\nPaper and Civics lessons they must acquire the sense that they can shape\ntheir own future and more important that it is their responsibility to shape\nSingapore's future They must be able to think independently and rationally\nand reach informed conclusions about national issues 26 MOE will take 3-4\nyears to implement the new syllabi As the school curriculum is already heavy\nwe will make the changes without increasing the curriculum load We want the\nnew syllabi to give teachers more time not less to engage in creative ways to\nbring issues to life for their students", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d178b5fc-7ae1-4041-a095-8e6483fcce88", "added":

now\nah LTA has come out with a website for traffic\n\n\nWhat happens is that they have installed satellite systems into\neach taxi so that when you log on onto internet on the website it tells you\non the map which road is a lot of traffic jam which road is clear and all\nthat\n\n\nThis is amazing\n\n\nI think this is fantastic\n\n\nFinally there is a technology like that\n\n\nThis is amazing what happens is this\n\n\nIf you log on and you look on the map if you see a green road\n\n\nGreen road means clear no traffic\n\n\nThat\u00c6s good\n\n\nGo ahead and drive there if you want

think that was good on the news\n\n\nBut I want to want to ask a question\n\n\nWhen the kidnappers were taking the monkeys away what were they\nthinking\n\n\nWere they thinking of selling the monkeys to somebody here in\nSingapore\n\n\nGo to aunty aunty no no this one is that the monkey that one stolen\none\n\n\nIt's actually red rabbit very good for Chinese New Year angpow\n\n\nI think those kidnappers are basically idiots\n\n\nThat's what they are \n\n\n\n<$C> \n\nMay Day 1989 is a time for rejoicing\n\n\nFour years ago on May Day 1985 Singaporeans were down in the dumps\nsuffering their first recession since 1964\n\n\nWhat have we learnt from this experience\n\n\nFirst that we must be careful not to push high wage increases in\n1979 and should have stopped them by 1982\n\n\nUnfortunately we repeated them in 1983 and 1984 and these wage\nincreases ran ahead of productivity growth\n\n\nThis caused our unit labour cost to be higher than that of South\nKorea Taiwan and Hong Kong\n\n\nSecond the strengthening Singapore dollar increased our\nuncompetitiveness in exports\n\n\nWe must avoid repeating this error by closely monitoring wage\nlevels productivity increases exchange rates and the profitability of\nenterprises in Singapore compared to South Korea Taiwan and Hong Kong\n\n\nWe corrected our errors by cutting costs and so enabled managements\nto recapture exports that made for 1988's growth rate of 11 per cent\n\n\nCould we have guaranteed this recovery\n\n\nNo way\n\n\nThe union had to depend on the government's judgments and good\nfaith\n\n\nThe NTUC was formed in 1961 after the non-Communist unions split\naway from the Association of Trade Union  which was controlled by\npro-Communist union\n\n\nA few weeks before that 13 pro-Communist Assemblymen had broken\naway from the PAP to form the Barisan Sosialis\n\n\nFrom the start there was trust and confidence between PAP and NTUC\n\n\nIt has been maintained ever since\n\n\nNTUC leaders knew that PAP Government policies were tailored to\nhelp generate high profits for companies in order that we can wipe out\nunemployment and later pay better wages\n\n\nAs the economy advanced good wages plus high government revenues\npaid for HDB homes good hospitals schools community centres and all the\ninfrastructure and facilities of modern city\n\n\nToday 84 per cent of our workers own their own homes\n\n\nAll have CPF accounts averaging\n\n$37000 after ten years and\n\n$22000 after five years\n\n\nOnce we knew by mid 1988 that we headed for exceptional growth the\ngovernment restored all pay cuts in the public sector\n\n\nWhen we knew by December 1988 that we had made 11 per cent growth\nwe declared one and a half months year end bonus on top of the one month\nAnnual Wage Supplement\n\n\nWe have set the pace for the private sector\n\n\nEmployers must play their part in maintaining trust and confidence\nbetween their workers and themselves\n\n\nWhen workers have shared hard times they deserve to share good\ntimes\n\n\nWorkers management and government have a joint responsibility to\nkeep up this climate of trust and confidence in each other \n\n\n\n<$D> \n\nHello\n\n\nThank you\n\n\nThank you very much\n\n\nWelcome to TWG\n\n\nuh we got a nice show for you\n\n\nOn our show tonight ladies and gentlemen we have Jamie Yeo from\nGrowing

and the\nexciting prospects of winning the Malaysia Cup\n\n\nBut former skipper of the National team Terry Pamanathan feels that\nhaving good players might not always mean winning the game\n\n\nSo is this then a sign of better things to come for Singapore\nsoccer \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nHi I'm Lisa\n\n\nToday Hey Singapore goes to Seletar\n\n\nThe name Seletar was said to have come from the term Orang Seletar\nwhich refers to the natives which Raffles encountered when he first landed in\nSingapore\n\n\nIn 1925 the HMS Pergasus completed a most successful and historic\nvoyage of discovery for the Royal British Airforce or RAF\n\n\nThe pioneers of the Pergasus had found the size of the future\nairbase thus starting a long association of the RAF with Singapore\n\n\nAnd these men were part of the first squadron flying halfway around\nthe world\n\n\nClearing the site posed difficulties including having to do the\noverhauling in the open\n\n\nBut even before being officially declared open the airbase was\nalready part of the greatest flight in history in 1928 during the Far East\nflight\n\n\nUpon its completion the airbase welcomed celebrities and aviation\naccess to their grounds\n\n\nSir Charles <unclear> word </unclear> Smith considered one of the\ngreat pilots of all time landed in Seletar in 1930 as part of his\nrecord-breaking flight from England to Australia\n\n\nAnother familiar name is Britain's Amy Johnson the first woman to\nmake the solo flight from Britain to Australia\n\n\nIn May 1930 the weather-beaten Gypsy Moth arrived safely in Seletar\ndespite battling the monsoon rains\n\n\nOther celebrities to also use the base included one of silver\nscreen's leading men Douglas Fairbank Senior\n\n\nA frequent visitor was English playwright actor composer director\nSir Noel Howard\n\n\nMany aviation adventurers and different aircraft models had made\ntheir way or passed through Seletar\n\n\nBut the giant silver <unclear> word </unclear> plane Sunderland was\nthe longest serving RAF aircraft in Singapore\n\n\nThe <unclear> word </unclear> torpedo bomber was also included in\nthe number 36 squadron and the Burmese incident further saw the need to beef\nup the squadron\n\n\nThus the inclusion of the <unclear> word </unclear> torpedo bombers\n\n\nThe peace time task of the air base came to an abrupt end with the\nonset of World War II\n\n\nRecognising the strength of the base the Japanese navy quickly\nrestored Seletar making it fully operational and named it Seletar <unclear>\nword </unclear>\n\n\nThe need for ammunition caused the Japanese to ship any available\nmetal to Japan including the removal of metal girdles off these hangars\n\n\nSeletar Ville continued its peaceful operations after the war\n\n\nThe Countess Mounbatten of Burma paid a special visit and so did\nthe Duke and Duchess of <unclear> word </unclear> during the royal tour of\nthe Far East in 1952\n\n\nThe air base has gone through several phases since its completion\nand with the establishment of the SAF Training Centre in June 1965 it marked\nthe gradual end of RAF in Singapore\n\n\nInitially operations at the air base were peaceful in nature\nincluding conducting of surveys metereological flights and escorting VIPs\n\n\nHowever incidents like the Burmese rebellion in the 1930s showed\nthe need to modernise the air base\n\n\nThis led to the housing of local employees and later on the RAF\nofficers in an area known as Seletar Ville\n\n\nBut where is Seletar Ville currently\n\n\nTo find out join us after the break\n\n\nThat in turn led to a residential area affectionately known as\nSeletar Ville found within Seletar Camp Complex\n\n\nJalan Kayu was named after Mr C E Woods the principal works and\nbuilding officer-in-charge of the original air base\n\n\nBut due to his request the Malay equivalent of his name is used\ninstead\n\n\nAnother thing that tells you 'you're here' are these guarded gates\nbut what lies beyond them\n\n\nLet's find out\n\n\nEntering the complex is like venturing into another country\naltogether\n\n\nNot only are there no tall buildings to block your view there is no\nheavy traffic\n\n\nThus ensuring minimum noise and air pollution\n\n\nWhat would greet you are decades old terraces and semi-detached\nhouses built ages ago greenery and narrow winding roads\n\n\nTake a look at some of these landmarks that should surely take you\nback in time\n\n\nSeletar Ville still uses most of its original road names and just\nrattling these names often would make it seem like you are in England instead\nof Singapore\n\n\nMost of the houses here are unique in their own ways\n\n\nAnd residents are able to add their personal touch to the\nsurroundings as shown by the cute and artistic letter boxes here\n\n\nThe plants are definitely an interesting sight which we will\nexplore later but I was curious to find out more about the lifestyle here\n\n\nSo I went to see April and Jerry <unclear> word </unclear>\nresidents here since twenty years ago\n\n\nThe West camp is where you will find Seletar Airport which is run\nby the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore and it is from here that all air\ntraffic is controlled\n\n\nFrom this relatively new tower you can actually see some old\nlandmark particularly the old tower\n\n\nSome of the old landmarks within Seletar air base dated as far back\nas the early days of the RAF\n\n\nUnfortunately the original structures had to make way due to the\nravages of World War II and later further expansion\n\n\nThe airport has had a few towers built since 1928\n\n\nThe current change is due to the ever expanding role of the airport\nthat sees the need for new facilities to be accommodated\n\n\nThus the old tower had to be abandoned but recognising its\nhistorical value the tower though deserted still remains\n\n\nAnd taking over its air control responsibilities is this new tower\nthe highest structure in Seletar\n\n\nNew hangars have been built to replace the old ones\n\n\nAlthough the Japanese removed the metal girdles off the original\nhangars to ship to Japan the infrastructures remained\n\n\nAnd those who wish to know when the structures were built there is\nthe date for all to see a year after the air base was officially opened\n\n\nThe war wiped out almost everything and within the air field a\nlittle evidence remains to show just how bad\n\n\nThis thick metal door has holes all over caused by bomb shrapnels\n\n\nYes the force and hear of the shrapnels melted parts of the door\nflying is one of the favourite past-times of the residents here\n\n\nHowever its role as the base for general aviation has taken up most\nof the air space\n\n\nSir <unclear> word </unclear> governor of Straits Settlement in\n1930 was quoted to have said that Singapore would become one of the largest\nand most important airports in the world\n\n\nBased on what Seletar Airport alone has turned out he would have\nbeen proud of his prediction\n\n\nThe services within the airfield varies aircrafts like the C130 as\ntechnician Mike explains are always on standby for possible refueling of\nplanes or cargo shipments\n\n\nSeletar's peace time task of 60 years ago are still maintained\n\n\nWhen the need arise <unclear> word </unclear> or aircrafts for\nmedical attention and evacuation like this helicopter could be counted on in\ncases of emergency\n\n\nSeletar Airport runs commercial and non-commercial flights\n\n\nAlthough the two make up only a small percentage of the total air\nmovement the flight ranges from regular commuter operations to Tioman daily\ncargo flights to Batam and bringing in fresh seafood for restaurants here\n\n\nIf the original air base saw the likes of screen idols kings and\nministers the new passenger terminal also has a list of whos's who\n\n\nMany personalities have chosen Seletar Airport for its privacy\n\n\nThese included mega stars like Jackie Chan Jean Claude Van-Damme\nCindy Crawford and many more\n\n\nMaintenance is still very much a part of the airport's services\n\n\nThe availability of facilities in Seletar sees aircrafts from\naround the region seeking maintenance at the air base\n\n\nWith about 9000 air movements per month the air port definitely has\nits hands full and contributing greatly to the functioning\n\n\nAnd safety of aviation at Seletar are a group of people working\nbehind the scene\n\n\nJust like any other airport the air traffic controllers work round\nthe clock to ensure smooth and safe air traffic flow\n\n\nAlthough Seletar Airport today functions as a general aviation\nairport the majority of its flying movements still come from flying training\n\n\nIt also continues to be a place for young Singaporeans to realise\ntheir dreams of learning how to fly\n\n\nThe wings of Singapore continues to soar with the increasing\ninterest of aviation shown by the current crop of youngsters\n\n\nAnd all their interest began in 1928 when the Republic of Singapore\nFlying Club was founded\n\n\nAlthough it cost quite a bit to get your flying license it sure\nbeat swinging a golf club\n\n\nDennis tell us more\n\n\nWell that's a sum that most students can't afford\n\n\nBut if they meet the pre-requisites the Youth Flying Club is the\nplace for such young aspiring pilots\n\n\nNow apart from the Singapore Flying Club there is the Youth Flying\nClub which also organises activities for schools mainly flying training\n\n\nAnd of course I am not going to miss that for the world\n\n\nOkay I'll close the door\n\n\nAnd off we go to check out what more Seletar has to offer\n\n\nThis time taking a bird's eye view\n\n\nDuring the flight I was given a few flying tips and learned more\non Seletar\n\n\nWhen the RAF first decided on Seletar mangrove swamps have to be\nfilled in hills removed and rubber trees cut down\n\n\nAs Seletar continues to play its role as general aviation venue\nfor the region there has been an increasing need for space\n\n\nThus the area around it has been reclaimed to provide land for any\nfurther expansion plans\n\n\nJust imagine that in Seletar alone there are three golf courses to\nbe found\n\n\nThere is the Seletar Base Golf Course just next to the runway the\nSeletar Country Club Golf Course and just next to Yishun New Town the Orchid\nGolf Course\n\n\nImagine the sight seen by the crew of the Far East Flight who\nrecced Seletar back in 1927\n\n\nNow instead of swamp land cultivated trees lined the residential\nareas of Ang Mo Kio and Yishun\n\n\nAnd here it's a little trivial did you know that the fresh water\nat Lower Seletar reservoir is separated from the sea water by the stretch of\nland of Yishun Avenue One\n\n\nInteresting ah\n\n\nWell with some help from Major Leong I had a chance to pilot the\nplane for seven whole seconds \n\n\nIt was thrilling for me but I can't say the same for my very\nworried camera man With the spectacular view of the Singapore oological\nGardens from the air we decided it was time to take the plane back home It\nwas definitely a flight that will be etched in my mind for a long long time\nSeletar has managed to retain the unmistakable beauty of its natural\nsurrounding which hopefully will be preserved I am Lisa from Hey Singapore\ngood night", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nThis year alone music lovers enjoyed more than twenty\ninternational acts performing live in Singapore\n\n\nSomething quite unheard of before the copyright law was enforced in\nnineteen eighty-seven\n\n\nWith the depletion of pirated music record companies have\nexperienced rising sales\n\n\nTotal sales last year amounted to sixty million dollars\n\n\nAlmost six million cassettes were sold in nineteen ninety and more\nthan one and a half million CDs bought\n\n\nThe affluence in Singapore and the region has attracted more foreign\nperformance here\n\n\nFans of Paul Simon paid between fifty to a hundred and twenty-five\ndollars for his recent sold-out concert\n\n\nDue to huge demand additional rear-seat tickets were sold for thirty\ndollars and those were all taken up too\n\n\nThe in-door stadium was filled to the brim in October for a strictly\ninstrumental performance by saxophonist Kenny G and just month Gloria Estefan\nturned the also fully packed stadium into a huge lively party\n\n\nConcerts are generally regarded as the best way to market an album\n\n\nBut concerts like all marketing tools don't always lead to huge\nsales figures especially in a small market like Singapore\n\n\nAmong the recent concerts only Kenny G's performance made a major\nimpact on the album sales\n\n\nBut investment in the exposure and hype of personal appearances\ncontinues because for some the result are long-term\n\n\nTommy Page is one example\n\n\nMost record companies release between ten to twenty albums a month\nbut concentrate their marketing efforts on only three to five with a\npotential to achieve gold or platinum\n\n\nAn album becomes gold in Singapore when sales exceed ten thousand\nunits\n\n\nIt turns platinum when sales exceed twenty thousand and for more\nthan forty thousand units sold double platinum\n\n\nPosters and press ads are the usual medium for marketing new\nreleases\n\n\nRecord companies which have big names under their label also\nbenefit from free exposure to boost publicity and album sales\n\n\nBut the most important tool is still the radio\n\n\nMarketing new releases is made easier for record companies when we\nwork with sponsors\n\n\nBesides record companies artistes also work with sponsors to market\nthemselves\n\n\nKenny G's concert was backed by Coca Cola and its rival company\nPepsi sponsored Gloria Estefan\n\n\nSponsorship in music is getting popular among MNCs due to the lure\nof instant profits\n\n\nWhile sponsors help defray cost videos make marketing more\nexpensive but they help boost sales especially when artistes are photogenic\nand can dance and move well\n\n\nLack of space in music stores also limits the exposure needed to\nmarket new releases\n\n\nBut good news for record companies\n\n\nA new store provides ample display opportunity\n\n\nOpening soon is the Music Power House Singapore's first music\nmegastore\n\n\nIt occupies five thousand and three hundred square feet ten times\nthe average music store\n\n\nOver twenty thousand titles will be displayed\n\n\nMusic paraphernalia and related items like videos and laser discs\nmake it a one stop music shopping centre\n\n\nMarketing in music will increase in sophistication\n\n\nBut while more megastores may appear whether they will survive in a\nsmall market like Singapore or drop out is something we will have to wait and\nsee \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nThe songs and activities here to mark world environment day\nhas attracted quite a crowd\n\n\nBut those who came are mostly young well-informed about the\nenvironment and well students\n\n\nI didn't see many whom you would consider your regular macik and\naunties\n\n\nI'm talking about the homemakers those who don't usually use\nEnglish as a working language\n\n\nFor them it appears that the green message hasn't really gotten\nthrough\n\n\nThat seems to be the case from what I found out this past week\n\n\nI asked several homemakers with some help from a colleague if they\nknew for instance why this product with a green label is considered\nenvironmentally friendly\n\n\nAlthough many of the women we spoke to didn't know about being\ngreen most were in fact unwittingly practicing green habits\n\n\nMany said they sell old newspapers to the 'garang guni' man for\nrecycling\n\n\nThey did realise that they're actually helping to save the trees\n\n\nTheir reasons for doing it are more pragmatic rather than out of a\ngreen concern\n\n\nSo when it comes to making conscious decisions to be green like\nbuying this kitchen roll made out of recycled paper most would choose on the\nbasis of which brand they're loyal to and how much it cost\n\n\nAnd as for plastic many said they were reusing them for their\nrubbish and garbage which again is a green move that they're doing\nunwittingly\n\n\nBut many don't realise that they should also cut down on the amount\nof plastics they use in the first place\n\n\nThey don't realise how plastic harms the environment\n\n\nBurning it means releasing dangerous chemicals into the air burying\nit in our landfills means they wouldn't decompose for ages\n\n\nSo many housewives are still in the dark when it comes to making a\nconscious effort to be green\n\n\nWith according to the National Council on the environment there's a\nneed to get homemakers to be aware of the green movement\n\n\nIn a letter to Talking Point the Council went on to explain that\nhousewives play a crucial role at the home front\n\n\nThey make nearly seventy to eighty per cent of the decisions with\nregards to domestic purchases\n\n\nHome education has also been largely in the hands of the women and\nthey're a major influence to their children\n\n\nAccording to what the homemakers told me the reason why many of\nthem don't know about protecting the environment is that most of the green\nmessages are in English a language which many of them are not well-versed in\n\n\nAnd true enough I found that while the Ministry of Environment has\nmulti-lingual messages during Clean and Green Week environmental efforts by\nindividual groups are almost entirely in English\n\n\nBut I found this is because these groups face real constraints in\ngetting the green message across in other languages\n\n\nFor example the Jalan Hijap group an active green group which\nprinted this useful green directory last year could only come out with an\nEnglish version\n\n\nThe group's founder Mrs Cynthia Wee told me why\n\n\nI met up with Mrs Fatimah Trazil who recently won the Green Leaf\naward for her efforts to promote green awareness\n\n\nShe told me how else we could overcome the language barrier to\nreach the homemakers\n\n\nIt's clear that it'll take that special effort to spread the green\nmessage to homemakers\n\n\nBut even putting it in different languages is only a start\n\n\nIt'll take more to convince them to make really green choices\n\n\nSo we may have to think of other strategies to win over the\nhomemakers a group which if not reached may undermine all our green efforts\nnow \n\n\n\n<$C> \n\nYou could see Chong Pang city is the first shopping mall in a\nHDB estate\n\n\nGone are the usual narrow walkways the haphazard display of goods\nand the cramp shops you find in typical HDB shopping area\n\n\nInstead what you get here is something quite different\n\n\nAnd if you're tired after the shopping why not come here to this\namphitheatre\n\n\nIt's right in the middle of Chong Pang city\n\n\nMost of the time it's a convenient playground for the children\n\n\nBut if you come here during the weekends I'm told you'll be treated\nto a variety of performances\n\n\nAll these are designed not just to keep up with the times but more\nimportantly to bring back the crowds and the cash especially when\ncompetition's just next door\n\n\nNorthpoint the latest offering in HDB estate shopping is only five\nminutes away from Chong Pang city and it boast major chains like Cold Storage\nJohn Little's and Toys R' Us as well as smaller shops selling everything from\nclothes to toys to food\n\n\nAll in air-conditioned comfort and as some would say all under one\nroof something shoppers have to expect along with the good bargain\n\n\nThe result while the Chong Pang shops selling necessities like\ngroceries or food stuff are still doing well\n\n\nThose selling fashion items for example have been badly hit like\nMadam Chiang's clothing shop\n\n\nWhich is what Mr Loh Koh Choy hopes will happen\n\n\nHe's the general manager of the retail promotion centre a committee\nset up specially to help the small retailer\n\n\nAnd if upgrading in Chong Pang can change that the government had\nsaid that other shopping areas like Toa Payoh will in time also be upgraded\nto deal with the competition\n\n\nBut before that happens will renovation alone make a difference to\nChong Pang\n\n\nAnd this isn't surprising\n\n\nA recent survey of consumer habits showed that Singaporeans rank\nprice and quality of product as very important factors while ambience was\nrated much lower\n\n\nSo although Chong Pang city does look much better changing the\nfacet alone isn't going to bring the crowd back\n\n\nWhat shoppers want is for each shop to sell a wide variety of\nquality stuff at good prices something not all shopkeepers seem to realise\n\n\nFor instance displaying goods outside the shop may help attract\ncustomers but not if they look as if they've been there for a long time\n\n\nAt this shop the prices seem quite reasonable but the range was\nsomewhat limited\n\n\nAnd it certainly didn't help to display the goods this way\n\n\nAnd here it was a case of free for all\n\n\nBut often it wasn't only the products and the way they were\ndisplayed that needed upgrading\n\n\nBut that's not what the retail promotion centre thinks\n\n\nAside from the renovations it also has various schemes to help\nretailers one of which is the local enterprise finance scheme which allows\neligible retailers to get a loan of up to eight million dollars\n\n\nThis money can then be used to modernise or expand their business\n\n\nBut to date few have taken advantage of the offer \n\n\n\n<$D> \n\nSince his early teens thirty-one year old Lim Kok Tai has\nalways enjoyed ending his day like this\n\n\nThough he still enjoys a good run Kok Tai will never forget the\nrace he took part in five years ago\n\n\nHalfway through the race he collapsed from a heat stroke and was\nrushed to the hospital\n\n\nIt was a frightening experience but nothing compared to the news\nthe doctors had for him\n\n\nHe had diabetes\n\n\nLike other diabetics Kok Tai suffers from not enough or\nineffective insulant\n\n\nAs a result instead of being changed into energy the glucose level\nbuilds up in his blood\n\n\nAnd if left untreated this can damage the blood vessels leads to\nfurther complications like heart disease stroke kidney failure and even\nblindness\n\n\nDoctor William Chew head and consultant physician in the\nDepartment of Medicine at Alexandra Hospital explain why more Singaporeans\nare getting diabetes at a younger age\n\n\nBut while diabetes is more common among people who are overweight\neven someone as fit as Kok Tai can also get it\n\n\nAlthough it's widely believed that diabetes does tend to run in\nthe family it's still not known exactly how a person's genetic makeup makes\nhim more prone to getting it\n\n\nBut recent findings do point out that compared to people in\nAustralia the UK and the US more Singaporeans are now getting diabetes\nespecially among the Chinese Malay and Indian communities\n\n\nDoctors also know that those who don't exercise enough and who\ndon't watch their diet stand the greatest chance of getting diabetes\n\n\nBut whatever the cause for diabetes Kok Tai told me his illness\nhas certainly affected him\n\n\nUnlike before Kok Tai has to be careful about what he eats\n\n\nOn top of that he has to regularly monitor the glucose level in\nhis body something all diabetics have to do to keep their condition under\ncontrol\n\n\nAt this workshop at Yishore Hospital diabetics and their families\nlearn the importance of diet healthy cooking exercise and even foot care to\nprevent infection\n\n\nFor Kok Tai being able to do something about his condition has\nhelped him come to terms with the disease\n\n\nSo although diabetes can't be cured it can be controlled \n\n\nWell apart from being careful about diet and exercise there's no\nreason why diabetics can't carry on as they've done before at work or at play\nBut if you think about it the precautions that diabetics take really apply to\nall of us After all a healthy diet and exercise is the best way to go", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "09d5d0fc-6a88-4b4b-826d-df6c4d7168f3", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.740147+00:00"}

infrastructure like roads and highways\n\n\nHe also plans to spend some US sixteen billion dollars as part of\nhis short term stimulus package to revive the US economy\n\n\nThe US Congress has so far approved Bill Clinton's four year\neconomic plan in principle at least\n\n\nBut squabbling over spending cuts goes on between the Democrats and\nthe Republicans\n\n\nClinton has agreed to cut spending by an additional US fifty-five\nbillion dollars between nineteen ninety-four and ninety-eight\n\n\nBut the Republicans want more cuts and less taxes\n\n\nBut while the bickering goes on in Washington it's Bill Clinton's\nshort terms stimulus package that is attracting most attention\n\n\nBill Clinton wants to inject the additional sixteen billion dollars\nin spending to strengthen the economy\n\n\nAlthough the economy has picked itself out of recession and grown\nby a staggering four point eight per cent in the last quarter of nineteen\nninety-two he feels that the recovery is still weak\n\n\nBut not everyone agrees\n\n\nBut there are others who don't think that the huge budget deficit\nshould be an issue\n\n\nBill Clinton plans to spend the sixteen billion dollars on building\nbasic infrastructure like roads highways and schools\n\n\nThis so as to put as many people as possible back to work\n\n\nUnless previous occasions when the US economy was recovering from a\nrecession this time around employment level in the US doesn't seem to be\npicking up\n\n\nIn every period after recessions since the late sixties employment\nshot up above pre-recession levels\n\n\nNot this time\n\n\nIn fact whatever jobs that are created are not terribly significant\n\n\nIn fact real average hourly earnings in the United States have been\nfalling since the seventies\n\n\nFrom a high of nine dollars in nineteen seventy-three to a little\nmore than seven fifty today\n\n\nSo not only are the consumers' purchasing power been deteriorating\nso have their confidence\n\n\nThe US is heavily dependent on its consumer spending to keep its\neconomy growing and the fact that it's a whopping US six trillion dollar\neconomy there are doubts as to how much of a difference the extra sixteen\nbillions in spending will make \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nSurrounded by wire and wall the prison is much more than just\na physical separation from the outside world\n\n\nDeep in the bowels of this prison over two thousand inmates are\nlocked away for crimes like rape robbery and murder\n\n\nMost of these offenders are kept here for an average of five to\ntwenty years as punishment prevention and hopefully rehabilitation\n\n\nHere contact with the outside is kept to a minimum\n\n\nNewspapers and magazines have articles about violence drugs and\njail riots blank out\n\n\nTelevision programmes are also censored\n\n\nPrisoners are allowed only three hours of viewing time a day\n\n\nEvery facet of prison life is governed by rules\n\n\nRules that cannot be broken\n\n\nPrisoners know that they are always being monitored through a\nsystem of charts colours and codes\n\n\nAnd out this experience each will emerge to tell a different story\n\n\nTwenty-eight year old Johnny Tan was a teenage gangster\n\n\nHis red collar is a constant reminder that he is in prison lingo a\nlifer\n\n\nAnd this means that his sentence is twenty years but with remission\nhe only has to serve two-thirds of it\n\n\nThe blue stripes on his uniform indicate that he's on special watch\nmeaning he's monitored every minute of the day\n\n\nAnd Johnny has lived this way for the pass ten years since he was\narrested on charges on rape and robbery\n\n\nWithin the confines of the four walls there is nothing but time\ntime to think time to change\n\n\nOn hindsight Johnny blames his violent criminal activities on his\nyouth and as things <unclear> word </unclear> started to take control of his\nlife\n\n\nOvernight the teenager grew up\n\n\nAt first glance it may appear that the women's prison is less harsh\n\n\nBut the little touches only attempt to hide the sombre reality for\nsome two hundred pillow inmates housed here\n\n\nThree times a day the women have to sit in rows to be counted\n\n\nThis is called the master check\n\n\nThirty-eight year old Lim Swee Fang is used to this\n\n\nShe has been here for the past eleven years\n\n\nSince Swee Fang was arrested on a drugs charge life has gone by in\nslow motion far from the bright lights and busy streets of Orchard road where\nshe used to work as a hairdresser\n\n\nIn prison Swee Fang has learnt to live without many things\n\n\nIn the small cell she shares with five other inmates there is\nlittle space and even less privacy\n\n\nBut improvements are expected with the move to the new premises\nnext year\n\n\nThen inmates will get more facilities like toilets\n\n\nBut there'll still be rations\n\n\nUnderwear will be exchanged once in three months and basics like\nsoap once a month\n\n\nToday Swee Fang has learnt to savour the little things like yard\ntime\n\n\nWhile this is a daily two-hour routine for male prisoners female\ninmates are allowed yard time only twice a week for forty-five minutes each\n\n\nFor Swee Fang it's the chance to escape from the gloomy depth of\nthe prison even only for a while\n\n\nFor her yard time is the luxury\n\n\nOther luxuries come in plastic bags every Thursday\n\n\nThis is canteen day when prisoners will get a chance to spend half\ntheir pay on little extras\n\n\nThe most popular items are biscuits cigarettes and canned food\n\n\nBecause the precious canteen items may be used as mediums of\nexchange in prison inmates are not allowed to keep their purchases for more\nthan a week\n\n\nInmates are also not allowed to share their purchases\n\n\nEven for those inside there may have been a time when such strict\nrules about the cheap canteen items would have been laughable a time when\neating food off plastic trays would have been unthinkable\n\n\nFor Joe David that was the time before prison\n\n\nJoe was a successful businessman earning over twenty thousand\ndollars a month when he was arrested for cheating\n\n\nToday he earns very much less and sometimes ends up spending half\nhis prison pay on a can of margarine\n\n\nAt nights Joe sleeps on a wooden bunk bunk number four B alongside\nsome eighty other inmates\n\n\nHe also shares a communal bathroom and as far as possible he wants\nto be known as just another inmate\n\n\nHe tries not to let anyone know that he is a professional with an\nMBA a white-collar criminal\n\n\nAnd Joe recently got a taste of it when he started work in the\nprison library\n\n\nAccording to him the other white-collar criminals were envious when\nhe got the job apparently the most coveted one among the professional\nfraternity here\n\n\nBut for Joe the simple job is merely a chance to remind himself of\nwho he was and who he is now within the walls and bars\n\n\nThe prison is like a large pot of unwilling participants with a mix\nof races ages backgrounds and personalities\n\n\nAnd within the confines of the prison walls there is often no\nchoice but to integrate\n\n\nYet most of the friendships formed in prison are superficial mostly\nto pass the time to fit in\n\n\nAnd even on occasions where real friendships do form ties are\ndifficult to maintain when one leaves prison\n\n\nAs a rule ex-prisoners are not allowed to return to visit their\nfriends left behind\n\n\nThere are also inmates who are weary about forming bonds with\nfellow criminals\n\n\nForty-five year old Goh Boon Hock is one of them\n\n\nHe has been in and out of prison all his life\n\n\nA compulsive gambler Boon Hock made a habit of stealing to pay off\nhis debts\n\n\nThis is his eighth conviction\n\n\nHe knows what to expect and prefers not to take the risk of forming\nbonds in prison\n\n\nEvery night Boon Hock goes through a ritual of folding five\ncigarettes and smoking them\n\n\nIt is his treat for the day something he enjoys in the quiet\nsolitude of his cell\n\n\nAnd for the moment Boon Hock feels safe and content in his little\ncocoon so much so that he has even gone a step further and cut off all ties\nwith the outside world\n\n\nHe told his wife to stop visiting him after the fifth year\n\n\nWith no ties the pain the worry and fear of separation disappear\nalmost magically\n\n\nMany have discovered this cure especially those with long sentences\n\n\nBoon Hock still has six years left to serve of his sixteen years\nsentence for armed robbery\n\n\nFor him it's easier to ignore the outside until he has to face it\neventually\n\n\nBut for many others the outside remains too powerful a force to\nignore\n\n\nFor them the outside is the only real world and prison is only a\ntemporary interruption of that real world a world which comes to them only on\nvisiting day\n\n\nEach prisoner is allowed two visits a month and sometimes due to\nthe large numbers visitors may have to wait awhile for their turn at the\nmeeting table\n\n\nHere separated by a screen they come together for a quick but\nprecious twenty-minute visit\n\n\nIt is difficult to condense two weeks of news into that time and\nthe frustration of this usually shows as the years go by\n\n\nAnd sometimes meetings are bittersweet\n\n\nBut Johnny is lucky\n\n\nAfter ten years he still gets regular visits thanks in part to his\nclose relationship with his family before his imprisonment\n\n\nBut maintaining ties with the outside world is not easy in any\ncase\n\n\nDuring Joe's first stint in prison his wife left him under the\nstrain\n\n\nWhen he was in prison this time around his new wife stood by him\nbut it did not make it any easily on his two children\n\n\nThey can only visit him during the school holidays\n\n\nHe had admits that it is especially difficult to keep up ties with\nthe younger child who does not understand why he can only see dad for a few\nminutes a time\n\n\nFor Swee Fang the experience was even more painful\n\n\nHer daughter was only three and her son seven when she was in\nprison\n\n\nShe did not see them for the first three years and when they\nfinally came her daughter could not recognise her\n\n\nAfter visits Swee Fang sometimes goes back to reread her pile of\nletters\n\n\nPrisoners are allowed to receive as many letters they like but\nthey're only allowed to send out two a month\n\n\nBy the time the letters are censored the news may be stale but\nthey fill in gaps left behind by short visits providing words of\nencouragement\n\n\nSwee Fang has also amass a stack of postcards\n\n\nShe has received over a hundred just this year alone\n\n\nThese cards help keep Swee Fang in touch with changes on the\noutside showing her her parts of Singapore she has never seen before like\nChangi Airport the MRT and even Sentosa\n\n\nIn whatever form these links to the outside world are very\nimportant to inmate \n\n\nIt assures them that they are not forgotten that they are still\npart of the family that they are still a part of the real world", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM",

{"text": "<$A> \n\nLast year American perceptions of unfair trade led to this\n\n\nNow American frustration over trade is being expressed in the tough\ntalk of the President\n\n\nThe crux of the problem the American trade deficit which skyrocketed\nto eight-four billion US dollars last year\n\n\nMore than half came from Japan and it seems it's going to get even\nbigger this year\n\n\nChina is next with the US incurring a huge deficit of eighteen\nbillion dollars\n\n\nWith these grim statistics Washington has begun to embrace a more\nprotectionist policy on the grounds of fair trade\n\n\nAlready the US has imposed a one hundred and nine per cent tariff on\nseventeen steel exporting countries\n\n\nThen curbs on European argiculture products and the warning to Japan\nto increase semi-conductor imports\n\n\nDespite this Washington is seeking to revive the much feared super\nthree O one act which allows the President to retaliate against unfair\ntraders and threaten them with higher tariffs import quotas or sanctions\n\n\nBut even with American threats demands for more market access may\nface stiff resistance from the Asia-Pacific\n\n\nMost specific economies are geared for export growth where there is\nlittle reliance on the domestic market\n\n\nWhen pressed by the Americans to open up further specific\ngovernments will be reluctant because it would require radical changes at\nhome\n\n\nThe high rate of savings will have to be brought down and\nconsumption encouraged\n\n\nMore importantly politic interests are tied to economic interests\n\n\nThe LDP government in Japan is reluctant to allow greater access to\nUS exports because it would threaten domestic industries like rice and\nagriculture a sector which the LDP depends on heavily during elections\n\n\nIf it accedes to US demands the ruling government risks serious\npolitical damage\n\n\nWith anti-American sentiment already prevailing a hard line US\nstand may spark a back clash from its trading partners\n\n\nAnother problem involves China\n\n\nThe US has demanded that China clear up its human rights record and\nits arms export before its MFN status comes under review\n\n\nWith an economic recovery on the cards the Americans should be\nmindful of taking too harsh a stance\n\n\nDespite the present problems Asia is the fastest growing region in\nthe world still represents a bountiful market for US exports\n\n\nSo despite the tough talk President Clinton may need to rewrite his\ntrade policy to take into account the realities of his time \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nHi I'm Lisa Ang and you are watching Hey Singapore\n\n\nNow I bet you didn't know that the King Prawn D24 and the Golden\nPillow are names for different types of durians\n\n\nWell many of us believe that the durian is the king of all fruits\nbut for some this thorny friend is considered the smell from hell\n\n\nWell like it or not the durian is Singapore's top selling fruit\n\n\nAnd while we may be one of the smallest nations in the world we are\nin fact the largest importer of durians\n\n\nSo if you are a durian lover like me this episode is for you cos'\ntonight we are taking you around the island for the perfect durian\n\n\nIt wasn't difficult at all to figure out where to begin our hunt\n\n\nWe headed straight to Singapore's durian zone\n\n\nIf you thought that this famous area is simply a food's paradise or\nred light district think again\n\n\nJust take a walk down the main road and you will see stall after\ncolourful stall selling almost nothing but durians\n\n\nWith so much to look at we were spoiled for choice\n\n\nGeylang the best place to buy durians\n\n\nIf you come here at night you will see many colourful stalls\nselling either Thai or Malaysian durians\n\n\nAnd during the durian season in July and August there will be many\ncars jammed up back to back on this street\n\n\nAll here for one purpose only to satisfy their craving for durian\n\n\nSo I guess this is the perfect place to start our search for the\nperfect durian\n\n\nThere are no hard and fast rules for picking out a good durian\n\n\nEveryone has their own theory\n\n\nIt's said that the pungent the durian's aroma the better it's\nsupposed to be\n\n\nSo many buyers subject each fruit to a sniffing test\n\n\nOthers take into consideration the size and shape of the durian as\nwell\n\n\nSome vendors allow their customers to open up their durians\n\n\nIts contents are then judged by the colour and thickness of flesh\n\n\nBe warn though you probably end up paying for the opened product\n\n\nUltimately the only real way of telling how good any durian taste\nis by taking a bite\n\n\nFeasting on durians is not merely a Singaporean passion\n\n\nIt is considered to be a social activity of sort\n\n\nWhile we were out on location, we saw groups of families and\nfriends enjoying a durian outing together\n\n\nFor these people the unlimited supply of durians here beats eating\nthem at home anytime\n\n\nHere is a tip for all durian novices out there\n\n\nThe pick of the crop normally hangs above the stall and can cost up\nto twenty dollars per fruit\n\n\nWe approach one of the durian seller to find out more\n\n\nWhat exactly does each grade of durian taste like\n\n\nIt was time to find out\n\n\nRight now I have four different grades of Malaysian durians in\nfront of me starting with D2 D7 D24 and D101\n\n\nNow I'm going to open them up because apparently each different\ngrade has a different colour or flesh\n\n\nI couldn't tell the durians apart by just simply looking at the\ncolour\n\n\nLooks like it will take an expert to tell the difference\n\n\nHowever there are durians out there which have a unique colour like\nthe King Prawn which we will see later\n\n\nOkay I've been certified the durian taster in this show\n\n\nSo let's start with D2\n\n\nUhm okay\n\n\nD2 is pretty good\n\n\nLet's try D7\n\n\nThe D7 is a bit bitter that is what I like\n\n\nD24 uhm\n\n\nD24 has a bit of bitter taste bitter sweet and now for the D101\n\n\nOh my I know why they called this the 101\n\n\nI know why they called this the sultan\n\n\nIt's the royalty of durians\n\n\nThere are basically two types of durians\n\n\nThai durians and Malaysian durians\n\n\nSome people especially tourists like Thai durians but locals like\nme prefer Malaysian durians because of its richer taste and aroma\n\n\nSo which is the best\n\n\nLet's find out\n\n\nIt's easy to tell which country your durians come from\n\n\nMalaysia varieties go by numbers while those from Thailand have\nexotic names\n\n\nWe won't go any further into the mysteries of durian cultivation as\nlong as I know where the best are\n\n\nThat's all that really matters to me\n\n\nA short while later we powered our way down Johore where we went\nlooking for the State's most famous durian stall\n\n\nThe attraction here is one of the durian's kingdom superstars the\nKing Prawn\n\n\nYou can't possibly mistake its unique deep orangy colour and smooth\ntexture\n\n\nIt tasted sweet yet very tangy and it's easy to see why\nSingaporeans flock here to eat it\n\n\nThis is the nearest place to get the King Prawn which is grown\nmainly in Penang and since we were able to eat for all we could for 30\nringgit you can believe we cleaned out the place\n\n\nWell it seems there aren't any durian plantations in Singapore but\ndid you know there are is in fact pockets of durian growths left in obscure\nplaces in Singapore\n\n\nApparently people still make a hobby out of picking this fruit\n\n\nThis area in Upper Thomson may look deserted to you but it's\nactually a hot spot for picking up wild durians\n\n\nOur durian seller Mr Chua comes here often when he is free not so\nmuch for the booty itself but for the thrill of the hunt\n\n\nNo matter what his reason might be the attraction was clear\n\n\nLooking up into the forest canopy we saw many clusters of yummy\ndurians\n\n\nAll almost ripe enough to eat\n\n\nYou also would be tempted to hang around waiting for all to drop\n\n\nDurian hunters in Singapore never harvest the fruit directly from\nthe trees\n\n\nInstead they hunt among the bushes for fallen fruit which wouldn't\nbe ripe otherwise\n\n\nUnlike wild durians the ones you buy at stalls everywhere have\ndifferent grades and you can expect those grouped together to taste the same\n\n\nHowever biting into the flesh of a wild durian is always an\nadventure\n\n\nYou would never know whether it would be sweet or bitter like I\nfound out first hand\n\n\nOnce our impromptu feast was over it was time to prepare for some\nreal action and that only happens after sunset\n\n\nThey came armed with torch-lights\n\n\nThese durian enthusiasts were willing to wait as long as it takes\nfor one durian to drop\n\n\nMost of them were camera shy but we finally found a durian lover\nwilling to share his experiences with us\n\n\nAll right we tried Thai durians Malaysian durians and now our very\nown local durians\n\n\nWhat else is there left to sample\n\n\nWell for one thing people of this region love durian so much that\nthey practically use the fruit to make all kinds of desserts\n\n\nFrom durian crepe to durian pudding to durian ice-kacang\n\n\nNow talking about it just makes my mouth waters\n\n\nLet's dig in\n\n\nIt's amazing just how many desserts can be made out of durians\n\n\nThe Hey Singapore team found more than 50 over durian recipes in\nthe course of our research\n\n\nSome were a fusion of East and West like the durian crepe I tried\n\n\nOkay the durian crepe tasted so good that I have to bribe the\nassistant cook here Swee Lin for the secret recipe\n\n\nAll right so what are these ingredients Swee Lin\n\n\nYou would need whipped cream durian flesh and syrup\n\n\nAdd a generous helping of each into a large bowl and stir\nvigorously\n\n\nSpread the mixture on a crepe but be careful and fold it till it\nis shaped like a wedge\n\n\nNext add some garnishing\n\n\nIn this case we recommend kiwis and strawberries\n\n\nTop it all off with a <unclear> word </unclear> of durian\nice-cream whipped cream and durian syrup for a truly sinful treat\n\n\nThis delicious dessert is yet another example of the spiky fruit's\nversatility\n\n\nWhether eaten on its own or part of a dessert it's obvious that\nSingaporeans can't get enough of durians\n\n\nLast year alone over 17 million dollars worth of durians was\nimported by Singapore making us the world's biggest durian consumer market\n\n\n\n\n<$C> \n\nSchool's in again but for these final year students at Pei\nChai Secondary it's not a lesson on biology\n\n\nWhat's going on is a lesson on life skills\n\n\nThat's a programme which covers issues ranging from old age to\nabortion to pre-marital sex\n\n\nThe case being discussed may be hypothetical but its content is\nall too real\n\n\nThat's why life skills was introduced in nineteen eighty-nine\n\n\nIn covering issues like pre-marital sex the principal Mrs Song\nfeels that her students will be better able to cope with the facts of life\n\n\nThis way less mistakes will be made as they get older\n\n\nMost schools don't follow the way of Pei Chai\n\n\nWhat they do is to invite speakers like Dr Lim to give talks\n\n\nBut this is usually only once a year\n\n\nBut the laughter belies the serious nature of the subject\n\n\nLast year Singapore Planned Parenthood visited seventy schools\nlike the Singapore Technical Institute where questions like can petting or\noral sex lead to pregnancy kept popping up\n\n\nDr Paul Tan president of the Singapore Planned Parenthood\nAssociation spoke to producer Sylvian Poi\n\n\nProblems like abortion\n\n\nHere at K K girls below eighteen are first referred to Miss\nSantadarun\n\n\nAnd that's one reason why the Ministry of Health started the\nteenage abortion counselling programme last December\n\n\nWith about eighteen hundred teenage abortions in nineteen ninety\nit was a problem that had to be looked into\n\n\nSo what's the solution teaching sex education in schools \n\n\nThe problem is that many of us still blush when the topic of sex\nis being discussed There's also the fear that sex education will encourage\nstudents to go back and experiment It's a bold step but are we ready for it?\nWell whether we are or not we can't ignore the fact that our teenagers may\nknow a lot but maybe not enough", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "40976ffd-9971-4cb8-ba69-0f93fbf6a3ff", "added":

destroyed and rebuilt many times\n\n\nToday it stands as a proud witness to the rapid economic development\nof the city Construction of high-rise building everywhere\n\n\nRoads jam-packed with traffic\n\n\nMen and women buying the latest fashion\n\n\nProsperity has greatly increased since Wuhan opened its door to the\noutside world last year\n\n\nMore than ten years later than the coastal cities of Guangzhou and\nShenzhen\n\n\nBut Wuhan's economy grew by more than twelve per cent last year\n\n\nThough lower than the twenty per cent achieved by the coastal\ncities it's catching up fast putting up a good fight for foreign money\n\n\nTo date more than four hundred Sino-Foreign joint ventures have\nbeen approved in Wuhan\n\n\nThe total amount of contract signed is a whopping two point eight\nbillion Sing dollars\n\n\nThe joint venture partners include Citroen the French car maker and\nPhilips the Dutch electronics manufacturer\n\n\nWould-be investors are in China's one billion consumers Wuhan is a\nbetter place for investment than the coastal cities\n\n\nWuhan's strategic location has made it a key link in China's\ninternal trade\n\n\nLocated in the meadow ridges of the Yangtze river Wuhan stands at\nthe crossing of the trade routes from Beijing and Guangzhou and from Shanghai\nto Zhongching\n\n\nThis makes it an important hub for communications and inland\ntransportations\n\n\nWuhan has a network of waterways linking it to fourteen provinces\nin China\n\n\nIt boasts of the largest inland port\n\n\nTo make it a hot spot for investments the Wuhan harbour was opened\nto foreign ships last year\n\n\nGoods can now be shipped to and from countries like Singapore Japan\nand Europe\n\n\nTo make it more attractive as a foreign trade centre Wuhan's\nbuilding a new international airport\n\n\nTo be completed next year the airport cost about five hundred\nmillion Sing dollars\n\n\nCurrently the domestic services inland flights to twenty-five other\ncities and weekly flights to Hong Kong\n\n\nTo link the new airport to the city and to cut travelling time down\nto just twenty minutes a new highway will be built\n\n\nThis is all part of the government's plan to improve the road\nsystem and help ease traffic jams\n\n\nAlready being built a second bridge across the Yangtze river\n\n\nIt's expected to be completed next year at a cost of two hundred\nmillion Sing dollars\n\n\nMassive amounts of foreign funds are needed for these projects to\nupgrade the city's infrastructure\n\n\nTo meet this increase demand plans are underway to build a second\npower plant and to increase the number of telephone lines\n\n\nThere may be a power shortage but there's certainly no lack of\nmanpower in Wuhan\n\n\nWuhan's literacy rate is one of the highest in the country\n\n\nIt has some of the top brains too\n\n\nThat's no surprise since Wuhan houses some of the country's best\nuniversities\n\n\nWuhan is also China's third largest research centre for Science and\nTechnology\n\n\nThere are more than twenty thousand researchers working in over\nfour hundred research institutions\n\n\nLabour cost in Wuhan is also relatively lower\n\n\nOn the average a worker takes home about a hundred Sing dollars a\nmonth\n\n\nHis counterparts in Guangzhou gets twice the amount\n\n\nThe wages may be low but the people in Wuhan can afford to buy big\n\n\nThe employment rate in families is high\n\n\nWith their combined income a family of four working adults can\nafford modest luxuries like television sets and other electronic goods\n\n\nWith such buying power and a population of seven million people\nWuhan offers a grwoing market that's worth more than two billion Sing dollars\n\n\nA lucrative market for retailers\n\n\nCurrently there's only a few big stores like the Wuhan department\nstore\n\n\nMore than two hundred thousand people walk through its doors\neveryday and it's one of the ten largest in China\n\n\nLast year it chalked up sales of more than a hundred and twenty\nmillion Sing dollars\n\n\nIt's also the first department store to be listed on the Shenzhen\nstock market\n\n\nBesides being established in retailing Wuhan also has a strong\nindustrial and manufacturing base\n\n\nIts key industries are in iron and steel machinery and textiles\n\n\nThe Wuhan iron and steel company is the second largest in China\nwith annual output of about ten million tons\n\n\nOther leading industries include pharmaceutical chemical and\nelectronics\n\n\nFor its future growth the Wuhan government wants to further develop\nthese existing industries\n\n\nIn addition it has also identified two other areas of growth the\nautomobile and high-tech industries\n\n\nTo develop these two industries the central government has\nearmarked two special economic zones\n\n\nThe Wuhan economic and technological development zone also known as\nauto-city will concentrate on the car and its related industries\n\n\nIt should be

the normal course will\nbe taking in these ten thousand children from the EM3 classes\n\n\nIn most of these schools teachers have yet to know who among them\nwill be teaching these children\n\n\nWell teachers being teachers didn't want to speak openly about\ntheir apprehensions concerning these children but from what I gather they say\nthey know very little about these kids apart from a few horror stories\nthey've heard from their colleagues\n\n\nStories which stem from one very common public perception\n\n\nThese children for some reason or other didn't do well in the\nstreaming exams\n\n\nThey were placed in the EM three classes and as a result branded\nacademically slow by many\n\n\nWith that label came others difficult unmotivated hyperactive and\nrestless\n\n\nBut many of these children if given the right motivation learn well\n\n\nTeachers say that the key is to engage them in activities that\ninterest them for example computer use\n\n\nIn fact lessons in the new normal technical course would take on a\nmore hand-ons and practical approach\n\n\nThere'll be role-play games and project work\n\n\nThe education ministry says they've also designed a special\nsyllabus and new instructional materials for these classes\n\n\nMister Hopday teaches Mathematics in the Em3 class through this\ncomputer-based learning programme\n\n\nYoung as they are Iskandar and his friends know their priorities\n\n\nMany want to work harder this year and move on to secondary school\nnext January\n\n\nIt's a chance they would not have had under the old school system\nand that's why they want to make good this opportunity\n\n\nBut at the same time it's going to be tough going ofr most of them\nespecially when they face certain realities of life things other children\ndon't worry about\n\n\nI learn from their principals and teachers that these children lead\nanother life outside school\n\n\nKelvin Tan is fourteen years old and works part-time during the\nholidays\n\n\nThe extra money helped him buy a bicycle\n\n\nHis classmate Velu also holds a part-time job\n\n\nVelu works five days a week at McDonalds\n\n\nHe starts work after school at three pm and finishes only at nine\n\n\nIt's not surprising then that these experiences have had an impact\non the children\n\n\nSo teaching these children demands something more from the teacher\npatience understanding and genuine concern\n\n\nAnd some of these children have a maturity far beyond their age\nespecially those who have gotten into serious trouble before\n\n\nWell spending sometime with children has made me realise this\n\n\nDespite what people think of them many have risen above the\ncriticisms to deal with what's the most important thing for now \n\n\n\n<$C> \n\nEveryone needs some love and romance but in our modern society\nit's assumed we'll choose that special someone by ourselves\n\n\nSuggest a matchmaker and you'd probably get the reaction in this\nmovie\n\n\nMatchmaking is seen as something that only happened in the past\n\n\nGone are the days of a matchmaker or are they\n\n\nPerhaps matchmaking still lives on only in different forms and\nguises and maybe we'll respond to the idea of matchmatching according to how\nit's presented\n\n\nTake for example the popular game show Perfect Match on SBC eight\n\n\nPeople are scrambling to take part and it's become prime time\ntelevsion\n\n\nIt's literally a song and dance in this media version of courtship\nas contestants try to win their perfect match\n\n\nGame show or not there have already been two marriages\n\n\nAnd then there's love over the air waves\n\n\nThe deejays are so identified with the programme that they've been\nnicknamed the matchmakers and they're often approached by friends and family\nto pair off couples\n\n\nBut is only the media form of matchmaking popular\n\n\nNot if the commercial viability of introduction agencies like\nthese is anything to go buy\n\n\nThis agency alone has four thousand members\n\n\nWhy the great demand for these modern matchmakers\n\n\nIcebreakers claims a marriage rate of almost forty per cent\n\n\nThat's giving the Social Development Unit a run for its money\n\n\nThey even have a mail-order bride and bridegroom service which\nfinds partners from abroad\n\n\nBut in this age of computer dating you might want some added\nassurance in finding that perfect match\n\n\nWell that's what many people come to this man for\n\n\nChinese astrology George Koh is often approached by couples who\nwant to find out if they are compatible in marriage\n\n\nAnd if you think it's only the young who worry about their love\nlive you're in for a surprise\n\n\nMany parents are very anxious to make sure their children get\nmarried off\n\n\nUsing the traditional art of Chinese face reading and Chinese\nastrology Geroge Koh advises parents on choosing the best matches for their\nchildren\n\n\nAt a cost in doing so he also takes into account the concerns of\nthe parents as well\n\n\nFor marriage services Mister Koh gets about three hundred clients\na year mostly Chinese\n\n\nAnd for all that matchmaking according to the stars there are some\nvery down-to-earth profits involved\n\n\nBut for couples who prefer not to rely on the stars there are\nother alternatives\n\n\nMeet Hajar Sapier a woman who has matchmade almost four thousand\nmarriages of all races\n\n\nFor her and her husband the reward of matchmaking is in seeing\ncouples\n\n\nWhile olden day matchmakers receive token sums Hajar Sapier earns\nher living by selling clothes catering Malay food and also by doing\ntraditional Malay massage\n\n\nShe believes it's her strong traditional ties which guide her in\nwhat is very much a traditional practice\n\n\nFor the many people that come to her Hajar Sapier represents the\nhope of finding the right person to spend the rest of their lives with\n\n\nHajar Sapier always tries to get to know the person well and she\nbelieves in discussing the practical considerations of finding a life partner\n\n\nIt may take up to six months to find the right match\n\n\nBut the marriages last a life time\n\n\nOnly one couple has split up\n\n\nIt's not surprising then that people keep coming\n\n\nIt seems that matchmaking still has a place in our society though\nperhaps for different reasons\n\n\nConsuming careers may not leave much time for socialising or could\nit be difficult to find someone of the same race\n\n\nMany matchmade couples are happily in love and some feel there is\na stigma attached to matchmaking\n\n\nWe spoke to one couple who is proud of their marriage the\nVargheses were matchmade in their teens\n\n\nSixteen years later they were more certain than ever of the\nstrengths of matchmaking though they understand the lure of modern\nrelationships\n\n\nThey are happy and it shows\n\n\nIn ethnic groups like theirs it's the norm for parents to arrange\nchildren's marriages \n\n\nSuch was the case with the Vargheses and they want to extend this\ntradition to their children But are there concerns that matchmaking might not\nalways work out And most matchmaking today does compromise here suggesting a\nmatch but not forcing it as the motto of that biggest matchmaker goes And so\non this Valentine's night we wish every happiness to all couples in love\nwhether matchmade or not and wish here all the matchmakers do too", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "5c8d580b-f7bf-45c4-a046-3bfc72dfebcd", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nWell a very warm welcome to all of you\n\n\nAnd uh I'd like to take the opportunity before I begin to welcome uh\nDean uh Ernest Chew who is uh with us this morning\n\n\nUh I'm sure we all have heard of the film uh terminator two\njudgement day even uh if we did not part with our hard-earned money at the\ncinemas to watch it\n\n\nUh we all know what the film is about in the film uh uh cyborg uh\nmodel T8 100\n\n\nThat's what it's called fights it out with the latest advance in\nscientific devilry a model t1000\n\n\nNow the term cyborg is of course very well-known to science fiction\nfans or technobugs as in uh as they are called\n\n\nHowever the term does not occur in the Collins Cobuild English\nLanguage Dictionary even if cybernetics is explained at length in the same\ndictionary\n\n\nIndeed in the film terminator the ah model terminator t8 100 spends\na long time in the film explaining what a cyborg is\n\n\nNow I will not bore you with the details as to what cyborg is since\nwe are in technologically aware Singapore\n\n\nHowever interestingly techno as a prefix to a range of terms and\nactivities including techno societies and techno mania occurs in the Cobuild\nDictionary\n\n\nNow all these of course does not mean that I I'm uh criticising the\nCobuild Dictionary or its short comings\n\n\nPersonally I find a very useful tool\n\n\nWhat I am doing is to remind us of the strategy of that particular\ndictionary which as its preface goes is I quote\n\n\nTo make a feature of the most common words of the language and to\npay to them very close attention\n\n\nIt is also to remind us what its editor John Sinclair notes\n\n\nThat the dictionary any dictionary he says as a single volume quote\ncannot hope to do justice to the immense variety that is found in modern\nEnglish\n\n\nHe then goes on to remind us there are now whole dictionaries of\nregional varieties of the English language including the Marquarie dictionary\nof Australian English\n\n\nNow we're very fortunate to have with us today very many\ndistinguished speakers of which we have uh Ms Susan Butler\n\n\nMrs Susan Butler of the Marquarie Dictionary she will be joining us\nover the next two or three days together with a panel of very distinguished\nspeakers including of course Dr Jonathan Webster who is coming in from Hong\nKong city polytechnic\n\n\nUh he's not here yet but he's going to talk to you on computers and\nlexicography\n\n\nNow the crucial question that is before us today I think is surely\nwill someday a dictionary of Singapore English become be the outcome of the\ndeliberations of this workshop\n\n\nThat's always somewhere at the back of our minds as we sit down to\ndiscuss\n\n\nWe will also I think uh be asking ourselves will that dictionary be\nseen as the first step in establishing Singapore English firmly as a regional\nEnglish in its own right\n\n\nNow this whole question of whether Singapore English is going to be\na regional English or is it going to be a variety of regional English or is\nit going to be a series of colloquialisms is invariably going to be a thorny\nproblem\n\n\nSome will argue that Singapore English is to be distinguished from\nSinglish\n\n\nThat is Singapore English as it is spoken by me as it is used by a\nwhole lot of people must be distinguished from Singlish and others\n\n\nOn the other hand will argue that to do so is to be ideologically\nprejudiced in favour of a certain group of people\n\n\nI think next few days there might be much debate and I certainly\nlook forward to the many varieties of opinion that will be forthcoming\n\n\nHowever let me exercise the unfair advantage which I have by virtue\nof opening this conference\n\n\nAnd uh say that while we may debate ideology we should never allow\nit to stand in the way of making progress even uh small steps\n\n\nThere are many things that can be done even as we are discussing\nideology questions\n\n\nFor example like how we can begin the work of establishing a corpus\nof English as it is used in Singapore\n\n\nIndeed of the region especially Malaysia\n\n\nNow in some ways the work of corpora building has already been\nstarted by the department\n\n\nThere is the international corpus of English that the department is\nsupporting headed by professor Nihalani Paroo Nihalani as the principal\ninvestigator and uh with his team A/P Prabhu and Dr Anne Pakir\n\n\nIn addition to we will also have to work out the whole business of\nthe design of the database that is going to need particular attention among\nthe difficulties\n\n\nI can foresee is that while most dictionary databases privilege a\ntext base lexicon\n\n\nWe may find that a substantial portion of lexical items in\nSingapore Malaysia are speech-based for precisely the reason that there are\nnot that many texts in Singapore which will lend weight to this kind of uh\nnaming\n\n\nOr emphasising another important factor will I suspect be the\nrelative unimportance of the traditional distinction between lexical and\nencyclopaedic information\n\n\nIndeed in Singapore a constant cross-over between the two may in\nfact be desirable in a dictionary dealing with the workings of language\n\n\nIn a regional context all of these will I think demand answers and\nin some cases decisions and uh some of these may begin to emerge over the\nnext few days\n\n\nOf course in many ways while the designs storage and retrieval of\nlexical databases have improved by leaps and bounds some things have not\nchanged\n\n\nThere are many similarities between any dictionary-making even in\nthe twentieth century with that of Dr Johnson's two and a half centuries ago\n\n\nWith any dictionaries you still need helpers although nowadays we\ncall them research assistants rather than the <unclear> word </unclear> that\nJohnson had\n\n\nWe don't tell them this is what to do\n\n\nWe ask them to go out and do research\n\n\nYou will also certainly need funding which Johnson as you know\nfound in Robert Docksley and uh his consortium of book publishers\n\n\nYou will also have to make a decision as to what books to go in uh\nwhat items to go in and what not items to go in\n\n\nNow it's useful in all these to remember what Johnson conceived a\ndictionary to be for him\n\n\nThe dictionary he wrote in his famous plan was above all to be an\nuseful book\n\n\nIt had the task of helping the reader to use words and to\nunderstand the words of others\n\n\nA dictionary was also he wrote in a subsequent preface a reflection\nof lift experience\n\n\nThe kind of experience that shapes language words are like men he\ntells us\n\n\nAnd he says quote when they are not gaining strength they are\ngenerally losing it though art may sometimes prolong their duration\n\n\nIt will rarely give them perpetuity and their changes will be\nalmost always informing us that language is the work of men\n\n\nA being from whom permanence and stability cannot be expected\n\n\nI suppose that's why we do not have one dictionary we've many many\ndictionaries\n\n\nBut also Johnson reminds us in this way that to make a dictionary\nis in many ways a record of the lives the conditions and the aspirations of\nthe people of the society who use words\n\n\nI think this is a serious venture and it need support and careful\nthought\n\n\nNow the department will continue to support the and to extend work\nin uh the various areas of corpora building\n\n\nIt will forge strong and I'm sure fruitful relations with\ninstitutions and bodies like Marquarie University and Marquarie database\n\n\nAnd it will initiate and promote work being key areas in the usage\nof the English language in Singapore at the same time\n\n\nI hope that today's workshop will be the first of a series of\nannual department seminars\n\n\nAnd uh activities some of these workshops will hopefully attract\nfunding from CAS\n\n\nWhile for others if they are more related to wards publishers we\nmay hope to find yah support from publishers and other bodies\n\n\nFinally the department will like to thank the various speakers and\nuh to the dean for gracing the occasion\n\n\nWe will also like to thank the dean's office and the centre for\nadvanced studies and in particular its director A/P Ong Jin Hui for\nsupporting our workshop\n\n\nWe will also like to thank John Wiley for his grant and gesture of\nsupport\n\n\nFinally my thanks go to Dr Anne Pakir and the team of workers for\nonce again providing a meticulous piece of organisation\n\n\nThank you\n\n\nEnjoy the workshop \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nAh thank you Anne\n\n\nNow uh Anne's little poem from Stella Kon reminds us that the study\nof words uh begins above all with the study of man and his environment\n\n\nNo matter what lexicographers do and uh what we call ourselves\nthere must be above a love for words\n\n\nWhat has emerged over the last few days is the immense scope as\nwell as the immense opportunities of the task of Singapore dictionary making\n\n\nThe problem as Susan pointed out in the first day is not just with\ngetting a dictionary out\n\n\nThat's the first thing but also the vast amount of continuing\nresearch citation and collation that will have to be done after that\n\n\nBecause as I told Susan just now it's very likely that the first\ndictionary that comes out is almost immediately going to become obsolete\n\n\nPeople will say ah but there you are you know you don't have this\nword and that word so the first dictionary will very much be a testing ground\nfor subsequent dictionaries\n\n\nThere will be a there will have to be a number of dictionaries\nbefore a stability is achieved\n\n\nNow here I think the university is in a good position to bring\ntogether to initiate and to extend the continuing work of corpora building of\ncollation citation and so on\n\n\nIn this connection we hope that the conference will do at least two\nthings\n\n\nThere is an interest in starting a small group of people interested\nin works\n\n\nAnd in lexicography that is to carry on after this conference is\nover\n\n\nAnd uh uhm a title suggested for such a group is lexispore which is\na combination for lexicography and ah Singapore\n\n\nIt might not be uh uh bad term especially when you think of spore\nas a building point yah not uh uh a malevolence spore or a benign spore for\nstarting and growing something\n\n\nSo you know the department will support the work of such a group it\ncan include people like Rosemary who has been uh doing uh a lot of work\n\n\nPeople like Ismail Tony\n\n\nPeople from the ministry ah Anne Ivy and so on\n\n\nUh and all of you all who are interested the second idea of course\nis to take the idea of getting a dictionary together a step further\n\n\nNow the question here is how much will the cost of such a project\nbe\n\n\nThat is the cost of produce producing a dictionary against the cost\nof putting together the corpus the designing of the database the paying of\nthe research assistants and so on\n\n\nIt's not just the final product but also the whole thing of\nassembling the team\n\n\nThat is why I have suggested that perhaps a shared multitask corpus\nwith interchangeability and interinuseability be ah looked at very carefully\n\n\nBecause if you have such a team ah of people interested together\nsharing together the work of corpus building then it becomes that much easier\n\n\nNow uh there seems there remains it seems to me some hesitation\nover the corpus of the dictionary as to what eventually it can lead to\n\n\nI think that perhaps we may look at it in terms as a continuing\nprogress \n\n\nIf we think of a dictionary we're not thinking of the just the\nfirst dictionary we're thinking of at least a decade's work I think before\nsomething like a final or stable dictionary can come about I think that we\nare looking at least in terms of three dictionaries hem to start with perhaps\na history of or dictionary of Singlish a collection of words which fascinates\npeople and ah which we are trying to put together to give some meaning to\nsecondly you are thinking of a dictionary ah which can be useful for students\nand to the educated public and thirdly you are thinking of a kind of defining\ndictionary something like the Singapore version of the OED now these three\nobjectives may change over the years we do not know until we start work uh we\nare as I say thinking of at least a decade's work at any rate I think the\ndecision whether to go ahead or not I think in some ways rest upon people\nlike you the department can support the department can initiate but if in\nsome ways you find that it is necessary put the group together start\nlexispore for small for in small way and then we can begin ah talking in the\nmeantime also the department will hopefully be exploring with interested\npublishers and also with other funding authorities about how far we can take\nthe project I'd like to thank you all for being uh such good participants\nthank you", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM",

{"text": "<$A> \n\nI'll talk enough\n\n\nI think now\n\n\nGood morning uhm now the a to z\n\n\nI think I'll prefer to call it z and not z\n\n\nA to z of Singapore life\n\n\nActually is a modest attempt at compiling a glossary of the commonly\nheard terms and expressions used by Singaporeans in everyday life using Susan\nButler's classification or lexicographical works\n\n\nIt would fall into the category of Singaporean\n\n\nIt is a one-person effort\n\n\nSomething is uh myself to accomplish as a way of educating myself as\nwell as others about Singapore language and society\n\n\nThis alphabetically arranged compilation is intended to help the\nforeign visitor or expatriate resident who often finds the Singapore variety\nof English puzzling\n\n\nIt is aimed at a general readership which may find this a handy\nguide to dip into now and again\n\n\nI remember my own experience in Britain when I was given strict\ndirections and told to look out for the lollipop man before taking the next\nturning\n\n\nI wasted some time looking out for a non-existent ice-cream or\nsweet-seller before it suddenly dawned on me that this referred to the\ntraffic warden nearby who was holding the large traffic sign like a giant\nlollipop\n\n\nIn Australia I often wondered why there was so many no standing\nsigns which forbade people to stand on certain parts of the road\n\n\nI also felt sorry for poor bill posters who was going to be\nprosecuted everywhere\n\n\nThe sign read bill posters will be prosecuted\n\n\nThese I later realised were the Australian equivalents of a\nSingapore no standing and stick no bills\n\n\nConversely the foreign visitor or local expatriate resident will be\nconfounded by Singaporeanisms in the following ways\n\n\nEither he does not know the meaning of these words or takes them in\ntheir literal sense or is not aware of their full semantic coverage\n\n\nFor example in the talk of Singaporeans even the meaning of eggs is\nnot all that straightforward\n\n\nThere are black eggs which are a Chinese delicacy\n\n\nAlso known as century eggs\n\n\nRed eggs which have a special symbolic meaning because they mark a\nbaby's one-month celebration\n\n\nSalted eggs\n\n\nSometimes salt eggs\n\n\nA food which is eaten with porridge and which's often regarded as a\npoor man's meal and the idiomatic duck's eggs telor in Malay which is what we\nthreaten pupils with when they get all their sums wrong\n\n\nEven baby's one-month celebration in Singapore is not the same as\nthe baby's christening in the western sense since the occasion also signifies\nthe end of the Chinese mother's confinement and that she is clean to return\nto normal duties and participate in religious and temple practices\n\n\nAlthough the confinement taboos are not so prevalent today it is\nuseful nevertheless to know the significance of baby's one month celebration\n\n\nThus the a to z will include entries like baby's one-month\ncelebration and confinement amah or servant\n\n\nTake another example\n\n\nPorridge in Singapore is a bowl of plain or savoury rice gruel\nwhich can be cooked with small pieces of meat or fish\n\n\nIt is very different from the oatmeal porridge served in western\nbreakfast to which milk or sugar is added\n\n\nThen there is also the myriad number of words that are of\nnon-English origin but which constantly pepper the talk of Singaporeans\ngiving it its distinctive\n\n\nIdiom words like the colloquial rojak gilah kiasu kaypoh and coined\nwords like moneytheism kiasuism\n\n\nThe often frowned upon slang words like sabo zap stylo ichified\nbluffology pathology and the expressive particles and exclamations like lah\nloh meh alamak aya ayoh etcetera\n\n\nSingaporeans may well find some of the glosses useful\n\n\nSingapore has changed so quickly since its independence and a move\ntowards economic development urban renewal\n\n\nSocial progress and national defence has led to the introduction of\nmany policies schemes campaigns and concepts\n\n\nWe have generated a whole new crop of terms and expressions in the\nlast twenty years or so\n\n\nFresh words Singapore colloquialisms constantly emerge among the\nyoungest set\n\n\nThe national servicemen the undergrad and the yuppies so that the\nolder generation the so-called elderly person in Singapore this is someone\nover forty may well need a lexical guide to help him unlock the meaning of\nthe new patio\n\n\nAs the a to z is intended to be a visitor's handbook it also\nincludes descriptions of famous buildings and personalities institutions\ncustoms public events and awards and titles festivals items of food and\nclothing references to current campaigns and programs and a common\nabbreviations and acronyms that has gained currency in everyday talk\n\n\nSo the glossary should enable someone to understand maybe a\nsentence like you should wear the orchid dress to the swing party and dance\nthe kimo kimo\n\n\nMost of the entries have been gleaned from conversation overheard\nin buses shopping centres hawker centres at the work-place and at family\nreunions\n\n\nThe range of communicative situations reflected are thus diverse\ngossip polite talk argument quarrels instructions jokes sales encounters and\nuh oral sources mainly as these contain plenty of examples\n\n\nNot a few are derived from the printed medium expecially the\npopular new paper local cartoons and also from introspection which I found\nmost invaluable\n\n\nI take heart from Tony Hung's remarks that a person born and bred\nin Singapore is the best informant\n\n\nIn short the a to z compilation encapsulates the very facets of the\nSingapore lifestyle in the words expressions and names that express them\n\n\nNow the easy part of the task was the description of well-known\nlandmarks places and people and there were a number of sources one could\nrefer to\n\n\nThe problematical part was the selection of the language base\nentries to be included in the compilation\n\n\nThe items used to refer to Sing's ideas and concepts so my\ndiscussion here is confined to the selection of the linguistic entries in\norder to be in line with the interest of the workshop\n\n\nNow the question as to what to include entails asking questions\nlike which words are considered Singaporeanisms\n\n\nShould taboo expressions be included\n\n\nWhat about the Malay Chinese words which crop up so frequently in\nSingapore colloquial speech because they are so expressive and for which no\nEnglish equivalents equivalents can be found with the same force of emotion\n\n\nWords like gerum where the English frustrated or even frus the\nlocal frus are but weak substitutes\n\n\nThere are just so many of these cross-borrowings that a decision\nmust be made at some stage as to the cut-off point\n\n\nShould the whole range of particles and exclamations be included\nsince they occur with such great frequency particularly in the Singapore\nbasilect signalling the various degrees of agreement disagreement and rapport\n\n\nAs my work is only half way through I'm leaving the task of final\nselection to the end\n\n\nAt the initial stage my decision was to cast a wide net and to take\nin as many items as possible\n\n\nAll was grease that came to the mill\n\n\nI will have to be fairly drastic in the end so as to prune it down\nto size\n\n\nI don't foresee this to be very easy since the vocabulary is\nintended for receptive use and not for production and so warrants a wider\ncoverage and there is no attempt at prescriptivism\n\n\nWords like trishawthon moneytheism ichified will probably make it\ninto the final list\n\n\nHowever words like born she born a baby bring come or fetch some of\nthe uh items referred to by Dr Ho Mian Lian and handicap for handicapped\nperson will probably not be in as uh these are more grammar and pronunciation\nerrors and their meaning is fairly transparent and matches closely that of\nstandard English\n\n\nNow the main criteria for inclusion is that there must be clear\nevidence that the terms and expressions are in general use\n\n\nFor this I rely heavily on my native competence of Singapore\nEnglish\n\n\nNow if I had not heard the term or expression before I would\nrandomly ask two or three people if they knew the meaning of it and base the\nmerits for its inclusion\n\n\nOn that basis a word like bus train very evocative bus train now\nthis really refers to a long line of buses jamming the bus stop\n\n\nNot many people know about this so the status is dubious\n\n\nThere are about 700 linguistic entries so far and the compilation\nis still growing albeit at a slower rate\n\n\nNow to give you a general list of the entries I shall uh give you\nsome examples for each of the classification under which they have been\ncategorised\n\n\nThe categories are not mutually exclusive\n\n\nThey are a means for catching as many words as possible\n\n\nI believe Dr Ho Chee Lick in his paper tomorrow words in a cultural\ncontext will be discussing the arguments for including some of the categories\nmentioned here\n\n\nWell the first categories words or census which are common use in\nEnglish but which originated from the countries where the early immigrants\ncame from these words are normally to be found in any standard English\ndictionary as they have been accepted as part of the English language\n\n\nAttap kampong sarong haji kati sampang\n\n\nMalay words Chinese or Chinese origin kongsi samfu towkay and\nIndian origin sari chattiah tambi tobi hindi\n\n\nWords for this category of item there is a problem of how to depict\ntheir spellings\n\n\nWhether to use a regular spellings that have appeared in\ndictionaries or to use the present orthography so as to be in line with\nspelling reform or language policy changes\n\n\nI felt that it would be a good idea to provide both variants\n\n\nFor example the Malay word kampong kampong or kampung belachan\nbelachan or belacan and the Chinese words char kway teow or chow guo tiao\nyong tow foo or niang tou fu where dialects spellings have given way to hanyu\npinyin versions\n\n\nIn speech however the dialect words still predominate in a number\nof situation for example char kway teow\n\n\nPresumably these refer to food items which are popular with the\nolder generation which are dialect-speaking\n\n\nProviding both spelling variants is a good idea since although the\nreader uh so that the reader can then recognise the words when spoken and\nalso uh read the signs at the food centre\n\n\nThe words have come into Singapore usage more recently do not pose\na problem like feng shui\n\n\nFeng shui spelling pretty straightforward here\n\n\nTaiji also\n\n\nUhm the second category will be words used in English but have a\ndifferent meaning in Singapore usage\n\n\nThis is probably the category most likely to cause confusion to the\nnewcomer in Singapore\n\n\nHere I have kinship terms used as polite address terms and do not\nnecessarily indicate a blood relation like auntie uncle brother sister\n\n\nTime reference terms every time just next time last time this time\nwhole life and terms expressing a judgement or opinion\n\n\nThis is really interesting because of the Singaporean's habit of\nunderstatement perhaps part of his total kiasu philosophy\n\n\nNow we have in order uh in uh terms of uh degrees of from good to\nbad very nice and good really meaning excellent so if a Singaporean says ni\nnice good very nice that is really excellent\n\n\nNow alright can do okay so so that means good not very good merely\nmeans satisfactory\n\n\nAnd bad to very bad they have these terms lousy hopeless useless\ngone case\n\n\nNow the other category would be that ah it's a mixed bag\n\n\nI haven't classified them\n\n\nThis is still under number two\n\n\nMissy for nurse in general English\n\n\nIn Singapore English missy is nurse\n\n\nContractor\n\n\nWe say my contractor came to do something really means the\ndecorator\n\n\nSlept late means went to bed late\n\n\nElderly I mention someone over forty\n\n\nThe gloss may well change as perception of age changes with\nimprovement and health standards and people remaining young longer\n\n\nNow third category words spellings or senses used in Singapore\nEnglish not but not part of the English language \n\n\nOutside Singapore and Malaysia these can be further sub\ncategorised into words used in ma Singapore and Malaysia but not sup but not\noutside often considered as slang whose use is mostly in colloquial speech\nnow words like exsi ichified bluffology some of these words have Chinese\nstems like hiao becomes hiaosified parto cantonese partology didak\ndidakparthy how here there's a class of local words which express a verdict\nvery interesting from slang to howtah logek shiok bolehtahan macham macham\nperhaps you may not agree with the classification as lsang but then this is\nagain debatable and in hokkien lowya now b idoms idiomatic and figurative\nexpressions now this collecting this was most interesting idioms in English\nin Singapore English like no head no tail half past six bottomless pit his\ngrandfather's house pull strings father's scholarship idioms in Malay in use\nin Singapore English chinak bukek guching gurak ikan bilis percha lobang\ntarek harga of course you have their equivalents really in the English idiom\npercha lobang is actually spill the beans you know they have an equivalent\nidiom in English in general English percha lobang literally translates from\nMalay to tear a hole or something like that tarek harga to stretch the price\nin English it'll be play hard to get now Chinese from Chinese you have\nchiahchua literally eat snakes but English in general English would be play\ntruant liam geng  liam geng that would be recite a prayer literal\ntranslation in English similar equivalent would be give a lecture that in\nstandard English bao ga liao very interesting bao ga liao meaning everything\nincluded package deal everything included part of his kiasu philosophy chap\nzai literally mixed vegetable uh idiomatically it's a mixed bag that kind of\nthing mixture and ngiao very interesting too onomatopoeic representation of a\ncat sound very ngiao I think but it translates into bitchy or caty but it's\nmore bitchy actually well another one uh English versions uh where the\nEnglish some exist in both the local version and Singapore English like in\nMalay you have paly play main main translates into Singapore English play\nplay both versions

exclamations and particles which convey attitudes and emotions\nexclamations like the whole list adoey alamak ambouy chilakak or bochok siow\nthis is not a definitive list I have much more now exclamations uh particles\nI won't go through we've got enough of the particles already but three items\nunder exclamations which seem to me to be interesting why don't I put them in\nbecause they occurred in my corpus when I was recording classrooms in\nSingapore I have thirty-one tapes on classsrooms and these there were times\nwhen I had to assign a meaning to these exclamations like yeeee yierh wha now\nthe teacher waa asking soliciting for questions you know what did the boy see\nwhen the spaceship landed and the one of the uh pupils said oh he saw a man\nah come out and he had a green face or something like that and the pupils in\nthe class in chorus all say wha wha you know now what did that mean it was an\nexpression of actually gentle protest or wonder or whatever but this is a\nvery common exclamation yeee again is very common expression of horror yierh\nnot so much horror but perhaps dislike so degrees from wha ? yierh and then\nyeeee that's the worst kind I think the most intensive now this whether it\nwill finally go into my list or not I have not yet decided but I'll just\nrecorded as I said the initial thrust was to bag everything now the items in\nsome of the classifications are particularly susceptible to change while the\nexclamation alamak is still of common currency others like obochok and\nkusemangat are heard only among the older generation of peranakans whose\nlanguage is fast disappearing these I expect will fall into disuse in a few\nyears' time as the peranakan elders pass away the entries will have to be\nrevised regularly already what was a half-tank rule when I first started my\nentry was half-tank rule now I've changed it to three-quarter tank rule the\nthird child is another entry which has to be given a different gloss in the\nlight of policy change in population control the one-two-three-four\nSingaporean will probably also change because of the changing Singaporean\nphilosophy you know on-two-three-four man one wife two children uh three-room\nflat and four wheels unless the characters stereotypes attain the status of\ninstitutions and form an integral part of Singapore's cultural history like\nthe samsui woman and the black and white amah even what is currently accorded\nsome sort of institutional status like the Singapore girl may have to be\nweeded out eventually the award for example queen's scholar was replaced by\nPresident's scholar when Singapore had its own head of state and pirate taxi\nhas probably been erased more or less permanently from the immediate memory\nof Singaporeans who used to take

{"text": "<$A> \n\nAlright I shall try very hard to pay heed to pay heed to my\ntopic which is how to structure dictionary entries for what and la or lah\n\n\nAnd what my first reaction and it will be a reaction which will be\nwith me for a long time don't do it\n\n\nIt's not possible\n\n\nAnd it's not uh it's it's almost like a rhetorical question\n\n\nOkay I had originally thought of using as a title for my talk he las\nlas who las best\n\n\nBut since I had to include what I've had to forgo that frivolity\nperhaps I should change the title of the talk to he las las who las best what\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I will indulge in a in another frivolity\n\n\nMaybe I shall play uh Dick Lee's song say lah in his latest\norientalism album\n\n\nMainly because I think you've been working really hard at the\nworkshop uhm run by conducted by Susan and you should take two minutes off\njust listening to the words of the song\n\n\nThere's a handout which should be distributed because the words of\nthe songs uh of the song uh can be found there\n\n\nWe must have also a parallel belief the notion that that system can\nbe described needs to be described and it's worth describing\n\n\nBut how does one go about doing just that\n\n\nForemost <unclear> word </unclear> only standard and formal\nSingapore English be codified or should we need to include spoken or\ncolloquial spoken uh Singapore English\n\n\nMy focus in this very short presentation I hope will be two\ndiscourse particles lah and what\n\n\nAnd on the references that I've given out to you you'll find that\nthere are lots of people who have attempted to describe these particles\n\n\nOne to eleven and for number eleven it's another ae done by one of\nour students\n\n\nAlright we have the problem of definition\n\n\nIf you look at that workshop that you've just done\n\n\nIf you turn to page eleven for the lexical entry headword lah\n\n\nWhat can we do to describe this uh discourse particle\n\n\nIf you want to have a definition in terms of a linguistic analysis\nwe can say oh yes definish uh discourse particles\n\n\nWell they're also known as communicative particles pragmatic\nparticles modal particles etcetera and these are not really lexically there\nyou know\n\n\nThey are empty morphemes\n\n\nThey add communicative meaning to utterances\n\n\nThey modify the meaning of sentences or they express emotive\nattitudes of speakers the word\n\n\nSpeakers is really important because I think that's where our\nproblem is\n\n\nIf we're going to codify this and under language label it will be\ncolloquial spoken\n\n\nAnd uh just harking back to Dick Lee's song Singaporeans many of\nthem speak with a sing-song alright\n\n\nAnd uh we had a discussion yesterday with Anna on tonal and\nintonational uh information given in the use of discourse particles\n\n\nWell we'll find that the main problem lies with speakers\n\n\nIt's not what you say it's what you really mean and it's not how\nyou say it only how it seems\n\n\nUh I think these words even though they may seem very light lyrical\nuh words are words for us to ponder on\n\n\nIn terms of discussing this very difficult uh task of entering uh\nmeanings for this colloquial uh uh spoken form what or lah\n\n\nI think identification is less of a problem\n\n\nThe problem would be how these discourse particles are used\ndifferently by different speakers\n\n\nWhat what do I mean by differently by different speakers\n\n\nWe had an invitation\n\n\nI don't know how many of our uh language honours uh supervisors are\nhere who had the same invitation that I had\n\n\nUh dear Dr Pakir come lah for what high tea with us lor\n\n\nWhere ah seminar room AS5-03-20\n\n\nWhen uh second August 1990 Thursday\n\n\nTime leh 5 to 6:30 pm\n\n\nCome hor alright\n\n\nUhm obviously this is an invitation to join the honours class for\ntea but they have very uh wittily included this as part of the invitation\n\n\nHow many of you received this same invitation as it did\n\n\nYou no\n\n\nOkay it's made oh you did you did alright\n\n\nOkay did this this uh indicates to us that uhm the particle used is\naccepted even at tertiary level honours year's students etcetera\n\n\nUhm I didn't really get to uhm you know\n\n\nI I I called one of them up and I said can\n\n\nLet's let's match our meanings\n\n\nCome lah\n\n\nWhat do you mean by the lah there and she said it's friendly\npersuasion alright\n\n\nFor what uh and I said you know\n\n\nI would say what for usually\n\n\nAlright why oh high tea with us lor\n\n\nAnd I learnt this lor with a high rising uh movement because I've\nlearnt to to do that in the in the most recent uh years that I've been back\nin Singapore\n\n\nBecause it's a new particle that's just come in where ah as a\nquestion nasalised\n\n\nI may not have the tone right because I don't speak this particle\nfrom the viewpoint of a Chinese uh Hokkien speaker or a Cantonese speaker\netcetera\n\n\nWhen ha as a question marker and time leh\n\n\nShe says to me uh she said to me uh with the time leh how how do\nyou say it time leh\n\n\nSee I've to learn it\n\n\nI don't know it alright\n\n\nOkay time leh  and I said what do you mean by this particle\n\n\nAnd she said well it it's almost confirmed that you're coming and\nyou're just asking for the time alright\n\n\nAnd I said what does what about this one come hor\n\n\nAnd she had to explain to me how to say it come hor come hor come\nhor to indicate some degree of intimacy\n\n\nAlright I think among the particles here lah and what as observed\nby uh Ho Mian Lian and John Platt are the ones that are used by speakers of\nEnglish who use English as the dominant language who are higher up the\nsociolectal scale\n\n\nThe kind of skill they have and therefore should pose no problem\n\n\nBut the new particles are the ones that are a problem\n\n\nAnd obviously if I were to pull off another student they might give\nme a little more than just uh a a little different interpretation of some of\nthese particles\n\n\nAlright just a little not too much\n\n\nSo the uhm identification is not a problem\n\n\nWe can say they're usually not obligatory\n\n\nThey do not occur independently as units\n\n\nThey are frequently found in sentence-final or phrase-final or\nclause-final positions\n\n\nTheir meanings are tied to intonation and tonicity\n\n\nThey're not unifunctional and not uniform in their representation\nor meanings\n\n\nFor example Anna Kwan Terry discovered that there was a short lah\nand a long lah\n\n\nHer analysis of it of course she has changed her mind about I think\nbut generally speaking the short lah would be something like well you might\nbe going end of this year right ya possibly hopefully if everything is\ntogether lah\n\n\nAlright and the long lah would be they're picky right they want\nhonours grads no lah ya lah\n\n\nAlright that's the long lah\n\n\nFirst we have to under identify the multiple functions served by\nlah and what and determine their context of occurrences\n\n\nWhat does this mean it means\n\n\nWe can't just go to the coffee-shop and you know overhear one\nconversation jot it down\n\n\nLet's have a meaning for this there define it you know\n\n\nThere are multiple functions and the context of occurrence would be\na very important factor\n\n\nUhm in fact Platt Ho Platt and Ho in world Englishes said in a\nsituation such as Singapore where English is used by such a wide spectrum of\nspeakers\n\n\nFrom those with minimal to those with very competence and where\nethnically Chinese speakers use varying proportions of English mandarin and\nthe localised southern Chinese dialects\n\n\nIt would hardly be surprising if there were considerable variations\nin the use and functions of the various particles for some speakers\n\n\nThey may function as in Chinese while for others they may be mainly\nthe carriers of the pre-pitch movement\n\n\nAlright so uhm the the fact that these particles are code-markers\nwhich serve to you know indicate intimacy rapport solidarity and so on would\nbe accepted quite readily\n\n\nBut what other functions\n\n\nWilma Marie who has done quite an exhaustive uh list of uh\nfunctions said that for lah you have the function of conveying the\nobviousness of something\n\n\nFor lah you have the function of conveying a sense of suggestion\n\n\nEspecially to soften the tone of something which may sound like a\ndirect command\n\n\nThen thirdly you have the function of expla explanation\n\n\nReducing the tone of harshness or hardness in giving explanations\n\n\nShe discovered some new functions such as dismissing some\nunimportant part of a continuous utterance like whatever lah fifteen sort of\nthing lah and all the jazz lah\n\n\nThere is also a fifth function of that of deflecting and denying\ncompliments as in you know\n\n\nIf someone compliments you and you say no I was lucky lah uh and\ncompliments you again not really lah alright if you tell me that this\nworkshop is enjoyable and I said not really lah uh you have another function\nsuch as conveying a lack of enthusiasm as in Chinese New Year ah okay lah\n\n\nAlright in the work done uh most recently by my ae student Chua\nSiew Cheng who did a very exhaustive study of the what particle\n\n\nI think she had two hundred examples gathered from all over\nSingapore\n\n\nFrom Isetan Parkway Parade from uh many of the places where you\nknow spoken discourse can be quickly recorded and then transcribed\n\n\nShe had many examples of the use of what uhm in her sample\n\n\nShe found that it's normally spoken with a falling tone\n\n\nOnly 14% of her sample showed that it had a rising tone and that\ncoincided with the question form use of the words\n\n\nRight let me just flip through the overheads quickly so that you\ncan see what she has done\n\n\nIf you can't see it from the back I'll just quickly read it\nquickly to you\n\n\nI insisted that uh the context should always be there and the tape\nrecorded should always be on so that she could find out whether the pretonic\nand the tonic was there and she did that\n\n\nAnd she found that as I said in her data almost every time when\nyou had objection what you know like very tired lah here can sit don't want\nso dirty people also sit what\n\n\nAlright people also sit what\n\n\nSo that is an objection what\n\n\nNow this is an objection what which could also double as an\nexplanation what in my opinion\n\n\nBut she doesn't seem to think that she wants to put that in\n\n\nAnd she says oh the context is A inquiring where B is attending a\nparticular lecture\n\n\n'A' you going for lecture ah then must go what\n\n\nAlright this is another case in Plaza Singapura in the lift lobby\n\n\nUh A says but envelopes company got so many envelopes\n\n\nB says application letters cannot use company envelopes what oh ya\n\n\nAlright this for her is an explanation what\n\n\nWhy are you standing here for\n\n\nMy wife inside there what\n\n\nMy wife inside there what\n\n\nThere is another one where one of the salesgirls is displeased\nwith another colleague and she said so what\n\n\nThis is the pejorative one\n\n\nIt's found in in utterances that are usually uh overheard on the\nuniversity campus here\n\n\nAnd this is one that was uh quite clearly so you know\n\n\nThis Peter so what one\n\n\nI ask him to help me with my tutorial and he says your funeral\n\n\nYa he damn what one \n\n\nThis is the pejorative one and this is another example of\nexplanation\n\n\nWhat so expensive this for charity what\n\n\nThis is an assertion what \n\n\nAccording to her analysis test on Wednesday whole book ah Die lah\nholidays never study never mind lah got two days what\n\n\nAnother example where it's pretonic and then the falling on the\ntonic what I think you can take or you can go down to b2 and you take up\nprobably Singaporean way of kiasu ya that's why ks style what then there is\nthe persuasion what uh in B is offering A a spoonful of the sundae which B\nhas just bought and A says I don't eat this lah B says everything you mst try\nwhat everything you must try what and this is the ex persuasion what there is\nin her analysis uh comment uh a comment what uh this one blanket this one\nquite ok what this one nice what ok then bye it's only a gift I have to rush\nthrough this because we don't have much time now this is uh this will be when\nyou find that the the tonic the the movement has the pitch movement has\nchanged when A is asking her friends about their subject preferences major\nwhat econs and what soci major what\n\n\n it goes up with the question form this is again\nyou stay in halls ah got contact number or not why then can contact you lah\ncontact me for what another question form what with a rising intoning uhm\nthis is an indefinite what with a rising intonation also today is reebok day\nor what and in discussing what to eat A says you want what anything rice\nbetter alright ok I've run out of my transparencies now but you have an idea\nof how difficult it is to uhm to describe the functions of what because of\nthe very many possibilities that can be uh I I guess that are meant by the\nparticles and it depend very mcuh on whether these particles have their\nsource their etymological sources in cantonese in hokkien in mandarin or in\nsome forms of English yearn smith's article indicates that he thinks the what\nsh uh what in Singapore English has come from the british what in some in\nsome cases and you can look at his examples if you are interested now there\nare issues and problems of course uhm I think the conclusion that has been\nmade is that the functions of discourse particles in Singapore English has\nstill by no means being fully resolved and we have also to to be very clear\nwhether these pervasive particles used in spokens uh uh speech of\nSingaporeans around us reflect uneducated speech or the informality of an\neducated speaker what we do recognise of course is that lah and what are are\nthe ones that appear consisten consistently higher up on the sociolectal\nscale as I said uh platt and ho have uh claimed then of course there are\nother problems such as the problems well anna brought up yesterday in terms\nof lexical tones carried by the chinese and intonation that is uh uh a very\ncharacteristic feature of spoken English everywhere else and in Singapore too\nalright so it would seem that in addition to their functions of uh semantic\nor or functions of communicative and attitudinal uh aspects they have also\nthey are also carriers in terms of discourse intonation so uhm the problems\nremain when we talk about particles we also have to ask questions which platt\nasked three years ago or four years ago to what extent do these particles\nfunction as a speech community indicator or as stylistic markers and then are\nthey uni or multi functional so this would of course be questions we want to\nattend to if we want to suggest that lah and what for example deserve a place\nin a dictionary that we would produce here now if lah and what and other\ndiscourse particles should merit inclusion in a dictionary for Singapore how\nshould we structure the dictionary entries for such particles uhm I have I\nguess I said no at the beginning but I think because of this exercise I have\nto do something and I did the sample dictionary entry for what the definition\nas found sorry is that for what for lah sorry ok both of them ya ok for lah\nlet's let's look at uh the sample dictionary entry for lah and I say the\nentry is incomplete is dependent upon a large corpus of spoken Singapore\nEnglish which we do not have at the present time uh if we use the headword LA\nthen we'll have to give the alternative form such as LAH or any other forms\nthat are available I think that's only the alternative form in terms of\nspelling then parts of speech it's it's difficult to define it at the moment\nI I said you know maybe tentatuvely why don't we just call it a particle we\ncan call it a modal particle discourse particle pargmatic particle and so on\nand the form features you usually find it sentence phrase or clause final but\nit's not always so because it's if what for example is used as an objection\nmarker it can come out uhm uhm at the beginning sentence initial rather than\nsentence final let me see if A says oh you only had two biscuits for tea then\nB would say something like what two three alright it's an objection uhm then\nyou have the pronunciation uhm the data from 200 samples here indicate that\nit's often with a falling intonation stress and you you put that down but\nwhat do you do with the other cases where you have a rising intonation and\nwhen you have it unstressed etcetra in terms of language label maybe you want\nto talk of it as being informal scratch out the other informal or you can ask\nwhether it is a limited representation of spoken language whether it is uh\neducated speakers no speech of English and singap speech of English speakers\nin Singapore or uhm in the speech found in the spoeech of everyone in\nSingapore but it has it's uh meaning in terms of whether that the person is\neducated or not then definition is impossible at this point because of very\nmany possible meanings uh the etymology maybe chinese languages found in\nsingaporte and malaysia and some evidence that it's comes from malay too for\nlah usage notes would have to go in there now for what I guess you have to\ndefine what in such a dictionary with the kind of definitions that we use\nwhat the educated English speakers of uh uh the English educated speakers of\nSingapore use what in the ways that some uh I mean uhm most british speakers\nwould use what as uh taken from maybe the oxford learner's dictionary the\nlongmans dictionary collins cobuild etcetra you know interrogative seminar\ninterrogative pre pronoun and so on but then you would have to have a what\nfour or what five or what six or what seven which would have to incorporate\nall these other meanings that you find here just here in the colloquial\nspoken variety definition again is impossible at this point because there are\npossible meanings and it carries this function that function depending\nwhether it is stressed or unstressed whether it is long or short you know\nprotracted or contracted whether it has a falling intonation or a rising\nintonation etcetra but for usage I guess you could say that uhm for example\nin what you use what this is the cobuild's approcah you know get a huge\ncorpus and then list down eleven uses or twelve uses of what you use what one\npoint one in a retort to convey disapproval or to register objection to a\nsuggestion or complaint you use what one point two in a retort to convey\nannoyance in patients' irritation number three uh onepoint htree in\nrefenrence to an action or a viewpoint attributed to a third party onepoint\nfour to share information one point five to show agreement onepoint six to\nshow up what is oviously so and you can keep on listing all these possible\nuses and then you;ll have to say what what functions as you have seen\nobjections with a chaalenging note expression of obviousness with impatience\nand irritation expression of in indignation expression of boldness or\ndefinite opinion etceter etcetra would indicate only individuals whose\nsolidarity and familiarity are high would use it among themselves and never\nat the formal level howevere ofr uneducated speakers of englihs language\nfromality concerns do not seem to matter much all sepakers of Singapore\nEnglish use the what particle in their infomral conversations with friends\nand family members thus a feature of informal Singapore English in conclusion\nI would say that since there are so many problems with discourse particle\nanalysis in Singapore English we amy have to postpone a decision a final\ndecision as to the kind of animals these are and forgo making a commitment to\nthe multi multiple functions served by them for example lah and what can\nserve as linhuistic in indicators of the Singapore malaysian community they\ncan also serve as linguistic markers where as sociolinguistic variables they\nshow up stylistic variations then again in another sprial up they amy become\nstereotypes which becoming the cause of overcomment may carry stigmatisation\nand therefore will drop out of use in time furthermore the pitch and tonicity\nproblema have not been quite worked out a task requiring a vast amount of the\nspoken English vernacular in Singapore when

{"text": "<$A> \n\nMr Pro-Chancellor Graduates Ladies and Gentlemen\n\n\nMy very first words and indeed all my words from here on are for the\ngraduates for whom we're all gathered here this afternoon\n\n\nCongratulations\n\n\nI will not repeat what others might have declared from this rostrum\non occasions like this\n\n\nNamely that I wish I were in your place to start all over again\n\n\nKknowing as I do now the pitfalls to avoid and the opportunities to\nseize\n\n\nNo errors teach and enrich\n\n\nAnd although you must think ahead and plan your career never grieve\nover a wrong turn in your path or despair if it takes a little longer to find\nyour vocation\n\n\nBut while I have no wish to begin afresh I'm still filled with envy\nas I look at you all\n\n\nThe hopes the ambitions and the confidence that is written on your\nbeautifully unlined faces\n\n\nThe many years you have ahead of you and on top of it all literally\non top of it all those luxuriant mops of hair\n\n\nI'm consumed with jealousy\n\n\nHaving accepted the invitation to address this convocation I was\npleased to learn that my audience would be composed mainly of graduates in\nthe sciences and mathematics\n\n\nPeople of like discipline and disposition as I with whom I can\nreadily empathise\n\n\nSurely I said to myself with more than 20 years of working\nexperience there was much I could say that would benefit those about to leave\nacademia\n\n\nSo three weeks ago I sat down to prepare my speech determined to\npass on the fruit of my years of accumulated wisdom\n\n\nTo my utter disgust and frustration I discovered I had little to\nsay apart from the usual platitudes\n\n\nThat was humiliating because doesn't that mean my post-graduation\nyears have been uneventful and unenlightening containing little of note\n\n\nFortunately for my self-esteem the answer is no\n\n\nWhat it does mean is that there exists no easy principles that\napply universally to everyone\n\n\nRegardless of personality time and circumstance\n\n\nTherein lies the difference between the friendly academic cloisters\nthat you've been accustomed to and the realistic theatre of life\n\n\nMy message to you today is that there is no message\n\n\nIn real life there are no pat answers that assure you of a passing\ngrade\n\n\nIn physics at least in undergraduate physics you adopt a model of\nthe universe\n\n\nAnd on the basis of this fixed model develop your theories\n\n\nMake your observations and draw your conclusions\n\n\nIn mathematics you work from a given set of postulates from which\nyou derive theorems through Aristotelian logic\n\n\nUntil you change your model or your postulates you live in a\ncomfortable world of orderliness and predictability\n\n\nAll that will change as you step out of these hallowed halls of\nlearning into the turbulent climate of commerce and industry\n\n\nAnd yes even the civil service\n\n\nOut there nothing's axiomatic and you play by an uncertain calculus\nthat changes as you move from one job to another between one boss and the\nnext\n\n\nIntimidating\n\n\nEnough to make you stay in the University a few more years doing\npost-graduate studies\n\n\nNot necessarily\n\n\nWhile most if not all of you will have little use hereafter for\nnon-Euclidean geometry and the abstruse equations of theoretical physics\n\n\nAnd while the same is true for much of the examinable syllabus of\nthe science faculty\n\n\nAll is not lost or wasted\n\n\nThe ability to analyse to draw logical conclusions from observed\nfacts and agreed assumptions\n\n\nAnd above all the acquired confidence to absorb unfamiliar facts\nand learn new theories will put you in good stead in any enterprise\n\n\nEven marital ones I found\n\n\nOne word of warning\n\n\nAny acquired skill unless regularly practised atrophies\n\n\nThe ability to learn is no different\n\n\nAnd the intellect unless it is sharpened through constant exertion\ndulls\n\n\nIf I have only one piece of advice to give to the young graduate it\nis that he must never cease to learn\n\n\nHe must be relentless in his quest for new knowledge and a better\nunderstanding of his surroundings\n\n\nAnd he must apply to this endeavour no less rigor that is demanded\nby the disciplines of mathematics and the physical sciences\n\n\nBut logic isn't the alpha and omega the be all and end all\n\n\nLogic and the power of analysis are necessary conditions for modern\nliving but they are far from sufficient\n\n\nRational thinking I'm told occurs in the left half of the brain\nwhich is better at functioning in a sequential manner\n\n\nThe right half tends to operate in a simultaneous fashion much like\nparallel processing in computers\n\n\nImage recognition aesthetic appreciation and intuition are governed\nby the right\n\n\nNeither hemisphere is fundamentally more dominant than the other\n\n\nAnd which half is used more often depends on the type of functions\nthat are emphasised\n\n\nGiven the obsession of our society with science and technology and\nyour kind of training in an examination-oriented system\n\n\nThat leaves little time for mental exploration beyond the syllabus\n\n\nI'll be surprised if with few exceptions the right halves of your\nbrains have got enough exercise\n\n\nThis is a pity because good performance at examinations should not\nbe achieved at the expense of creativity\n\n\nDon't knock intuition or gut-feel as the Americans call it\n\n\nWhen Newton saw the apple fall and Archimedes screamed 'Eureka' as\nhe jumped out of his Grecian tub\n\n\nIt was the right halves of their brains that flashed\n\n\nSubsequently of course the left halves had to be put to work to\nconstruct more precisely the laws of gravity and floatation but only\nsubsequently\n\n\nThese stories are apocryphal but not so those of Kekule who grasped\nthe shape of the benzene molecule while day-dreaming in front of the fire\n\n\nAnd Coleridge who composed Kubla Khan in his sleep\n\n\nColeridge of course was no scientist and neither was Mr Raymond\nChow the movie producer who made Bruce Lee famous\n\n\nMr Chow told me he did not call for sophisticated business analysis\nto convince him that Ninja Turtles would make money\n\n\nIndeed rational arguments would probably have deterred him from his\ninvestment\n\n\nAfter all who wants to watch slimy green turtles emerging from\nsewers\n\n\nAs it turned out millions do and Mr Chow is so much richer because\nhe respected his gut-feel\n\n\nThe founder of IBM Thomas J Watson was famous among other things\nfor the sign in his office which read 'Think'\n\n\nHe should have added with both hemispheres'\n\n\nA proper balance between the cerebral hemispheres is necessary\n\n\nJust as the totally irrational person hobbles along on mental\ncrutches a liability to himself and others\n\n\nThe clinically rational person who distrusts intuition inflicts\nupon himself an unnecessary handicap and misses a lot of fun\n\n\nRational thinking must allow for occasional diversions into random\nunstructured reverie to discover and create\n\n\nWhile intuitive insight must be complemented by logical arguments\nwhich perform form and structure for it to be communicated\n\n\nCan I be so bold as to suggest that the truly educated person is\none in whom the two halves of the brain function in synchrony\n\n\nThe truly educated person is well-balanced in thought and behaviour\n\n\nNot for him the extremes of the religious fundamentalist or the\ndogmas of the ideology\n\n\nInstead he opens himself to new ideas however strange and opposing\nviews however unpalatable\n\n\nI fear that the trouble with many of our newly graduated is their\ntotal conviction on so many issues as if the text books they read and the\nexaminations they passed have conferred infallibility\n\n\nSelf-confidence is useful particularly in the young but\noverwhelming confidence can lead to prejudices and bigotry\n\n\nWe must not forget how Ptolemy's geocentric universe was replaced\nby Keppler's heliocentric one\n\n\nHow Newton had to yield to Einstein and why Einstein's general\nrelativity must eventually give way to a unified theory of physics\n\n\nHow can we be absolutely certain of anything when we must deny\nwhat's so clearly obvious as the solidity of this rostrum before me\n\n\nBut we all know that this rostrum is mainly empty space that is\nnothing\n\n\nThe wood consists of molecules the molecules of atoms and atoms are\nno more than elementary particles separated by enormous amounts of space\n\n\nAre there even particles or just waves\n\n\nAs I rest my hand on this rostrum I don't know where flesh ends and\nwood begins\n\n\nEven if you've never heard of Heisenberg the years in University\nshould have instilled in you a sense of uncertainty feelings of intellectual\nhumility and a guarded scepticism against every new guru appearing on the\npolitical economic or religious scene\n\n\nRemember some of the principles of duality and accept that\ndiametric opposites need not be mutually exclusive and annihilating\n\n\nLike wave and particle\n\n\nRelative and absolute\n\n\nCapitalism and socialism\n\n\nMonopoly and competition\n\n\nNature and nurture\n\n\nPrivate enterprise and government ownership\n\n\nHot and cold\n\n\nYin and yang\n\n\nLeft and right\n\n\nWhat the University has taught you is only a start an opening to\ngreater discoveries\n\n\nLet me as I come to the end of my speech leave you with what so\nmany ancient sages have said\n\n\nWhich is that the truth lies not in the stars and the vastness of\nouter space but in ourselves and the ordinary things around us\n\n\nWisdom is and here I quote my favourite lines by William Blake \n\n\nTo see the world in a grain of sand And a heaven in a wild flower\nTo hold infinity in the palm of your hand And eternity in an hour What more\ncan anyone of us want  \n\n\n\n\n ADDRESS BY MR C R RAJAH PRESIDENT SINGAPORE LAW SOCIETY \n\n<$B> \n\nMr Pro-Chancellor Graduates Ladies and Gentlemen\n\n\nAfter six years at primary school four years of secondary two\nyears in pre-university three or four years at university and all the moments\nof doubt\n\n\nAnd even pure panic along the way here\n\n\nYou all are this morning more than five hundred graduates ready to\nbe well and truly convocated\n\n\nToday you receive the degree scrolls that formally proclaim your\ngraduatehood\n\n\nSo what is it to be a graduate\n\n\nAre you any different from who you were before\n\n\nYes you are and I will tell you why\n\n\nAs a student there were no expectations of you other than a hope\nthat you would pass your exams\n\n\nYour graduation has changed all this\n\n\nYour intellectual capacity is now no longer in question and your\nability to stay the course no longer in doubt\n\n\nYou have proved yourself\n\n\nYour graduation has clothed you with a new status\n\n\nThere are now great expectations of you\n\n\nWhether you like it or not whether you deserve it or not unless\ntime tells otherwise\n\n\nYou are now regarded as a responsible and respectable member of\nsociety\n\n\nSomeone to whom problems may be referred to for solutions from\nwhom leadership will come and in whom others may trust\n\n\nAnd as surely as night follows the day when others look upon you\nand treat with you with new respect and regard\n\n\nYou yourself will change to grow into and accommodate the new\nposition your graduate status finds you in\n\n\nThis change will come faster for some than for others but for all\nof you it starts with your graduation\n\n\nWill the mantle of graduatehood change you for the better\n\n\nI hope it does\n\n\nHow do you ensure that such change will be for the better\n\n\nI wish I knew the whole answer\n\n\nTo some of you your enhanced status might go straight to your head\n\n\nTime and your own conduct will find you out\n\n\nOthers will soon have little regard for you\n\n\nThe rest of you will grow to fulfil in lesser or greater extent\nall the expectations we have of you\n\n\nBut all of you in the end will have to find your own answer armed\nwith the principles of truth and virtue that have been instilled into you\nover the years\n\n\nAnd as an educated person which you should by now be you have one\ngreat responsibility to yourself and to society\n\n\nAlways to think for yourself\n\n\nTo make up your own mind\n\n\nYou have been taught to do so and trained to do so at the\nUniversity\n\n\nContinue to do so through life\n\n\nApply your mind to a problem and find your own solutions\n\n\nOf course there is no point in re-inventing the wheel \n\n\nWhere you can get help or advice from a person with experience or\na book always do so It will save time But always make certain that you\nunderstand the basis of the solution or advice offered In the course of your\nworking life whether as a lawyer scientist or whatever else you might turn\nyour hand to you may only be a link in the decision-making chain The final\ndecision or view taken may not be that which you hold Be prepared to\nre-examine your own views and to adjust them if you are wrong The greater the\nreputation of those whose views differ from yours the more you should be\nalive to the possibility that you may be wrong if not in whole perhaps in\npart And if you are wrong learn from your mistakes There is nothing wrong in\nan honest mistake Those who have never made such mistakes cannot be prone to\nholding a view or taking a position But do not make the same mistake twice If\nafter all your re-examination you still believe you are right then stand firm\nmaintain your view hold fast your position It does not matter if your view\ndoes not prevall Remember that just as you feel convinced that your view is\nright there may be others who feel just as strongly that your view is wrong\nand their contrary view right Respect their honest views as they should\nrespect yours Agree to differ But until you are in your own mind to your own\nknowledge on your own reasoning and by your own instinct satisfied that you\nare wrong you must never never abandon your own truth for that of another\nMaintain your intellectual honesty and integrity and the same spirit of\ninquiry and reason that has carried you through the last sixteen years and\nbrought you here today will take you and all those who travel with you\nthrough a life where you will always stand tall My warmest congratulations\nthen to each of you and to your parents guardians teachers loved ones and all\nthose others who have in one way or other touched your life and helped to\nturn you into the flower of our youth", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "17c0e5a5-b478-458f-87b4-2a38105936cf", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.749762+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nI'm going to use what Kirpal Singh used yesterday and\nunfortunately he's not here to see this to hear this\n\n\nHe's a friend and and an old classmate\n\n\nI'm I'm going to use this thing if ever it exists called a\npublisher's licence\n\n\nWhich was what Kirpal Singh used yesterday when he referred\neverything to poetic licence\n\n\nUhm I have the unadulterated unqualified luxury this morning of\nmaking a vote as a publisher on whether you know you could produce a book of\nstandard Singapore English as a dictionary\n\n\nAh and without uh having to ask whether you would like to find exit\nor not or whether you would like to work as part of it\n\n\nBut first of all my vote and then what I'd like to do is after I've\ntold you what I ah how we feel as a house in respect of uhm the existence of\nus a dictionary of standard Singapore English\n\n\nI'd like very much uhm to consider its usage\n\n\nHow it would be done\n\n\nHow it could contribute or not contribute to I think it would\ncontribute to the development of fiction Singapore fiction Singapore creative\nwriting and in a wider scope South-East Asian writing\n\n\nWhich is the field that we are particularly interested in\n\n\nAnd how it would uhm uh play its role in the creativity and the\noriginality as a development of such writing\n\n\nAnd eventually whether it would assist this kind of writing\n\n\nTravel it's over and good to say that I would like to use a word\nshiok but it's not much good if your word shiok is not as understood as the\nword\n\n\nIn Jewish writing uh you know I think you would all of us who want\nto write or who are publishers writing\n\n\nOne type of writing to export and to travel\n\n\nCan you hear me at the back\n\n\nAnd then finally what I would like to say is I'd like to say I'd\nlike to postulate and uhm if I can within the 10 minutes Susan has allocated\nuh I ask you if you feel that this notion of Singapore writing can itself in\nitself take its place amongst some very large movements of writing that has\nhit that has its it's absorbing the minds of English language uhm publishing\nand English language writing in in the western world particularly in English\nlanguage writing in America and in English language writing in UK and\ncontinental Europe and in Australia and New Zealand\n\n\nBut first my vote and of course we would like to see the existence\nof a dictionary of Singapore English\n\n\nSecondly what we would particularly interested in is the fact that\nit would act if it were produced in the same original size of the Marquarie\ndictionary as a standard or a touchstone\n\n\nAnd a comparative one we hope against British English and American\nEnglish\n\n\nAnd oh what I would like to see is but it would act as a touchstone\nfor us uh uh a basis of comparison uhm a use of measure\n\n\nAnd in many ways if a kind of standard or or albeit whether it has\nto be updated or not of how English has been used in this region\n\n\nAnd I wouldn't entirely like to confine that to Singapore because a\nlarge amount of the writing as some of the researches have noted have come\nfrom Malaysia and South-East Asia in the region\n\n\nIn particular in English language writing or English language\ntranslations of Dutch or Indonesian writing in the early days\n\n\nBut I think an unqualified yes because we would like to see for\nexample its etymology as Simon so rightly pointed out\n\n\nAnd we'd like very much for it to be part and parcel of the\ncultural identity and something that is absorbing the minds of many people in\nthe government\n\n\nBut this dictionary we feel uh would contribute in great extent to\nthat identity and uhm that notion of what kind of what I'm a Singaporean but\nwhat is a Singaporean\n\n\nAnd we feel that that would go a long way towards contributing to\nthat in the development of fiction writing in Singapore would the last ten or\nfifteen years\n\n\nEarly English language writing began with the British\n\n\nOf course you know and with a large amount of their impressions\ntheir nostalgia their their feelings about uh South-East Asia the Chinese and\nthe Singaporeans here now though in the last eight or ten years\n\n\nWe ourselves you know in the pursuit of Singapore writing and\nSouth-east Asian writing have been publishing\n\n\nAnd we have within our editorial ru uhm room will tell have had\ngreat disagreements about what we can publish what we will publish what we\ncan and will not accept\n\n\nAnd we've uh we have ourselves seen us change our points of view\nhaven't we\n\n\nOur opinions on the use of\n\n\nUhm what I've learnt yesterday was called a borrowing and I'm all\nfor the usage of borrowing\n\n\nUhm we have borrowed from Malay and Chinese\n\n\nWhat I'd loved to see is to see us borrow from the Dutch to a great\nextent like a word like or even from Mandarin\n\n\nWhich uhm which I think in the longer run would be a language that\nwould give you a uh greater amount of degree of sensibility and uhm and and\nsensuousness and a greater length of poetic language that you can use\n\n\nUhm much more than say Malay\n\n\nCould you know down the road but I think a a dictionary if produced\nwould lend itself and uhm would be a useful tool and a useful touchstone in\nthat particular area\n\n\nThe next question really to ask ourselves is uh whether words like\nor words like sayang which was used yesterday uh would enter in the English\nlanguage\n\n\nThe way a word like serendipid uh serendipity does uh we're hoping\nthat would happen\n\n\nBut down the road if that is to happen uh your book your story your\nfiction your writing your Singapore writing has to travel has to export uhm\n\n\nIt has to would be exported and be backed by either a publisher or\na house or an institution in in the national market that is not our own\n\n\nI'm not sure if that would work at the moment\n\n\nI uhm I see some positive signs although I think it would be\ngradual and it will grow in concentric circles from the region\n\n\nBut I hope that Singapore would be the nucleus of this sort of of\nidea\n\n\nFinally the important thing to think to think about is uhm\nSingapore writing using standard Singapore English\n\n\nWhether it would be whether we would could consider that down the\nroad it could be a corpus\n\n\nI'm not immediately now but could it the kind of corpus that\nAfrican writing is the Jewish writing is in America or indeed that overseas\nAmerican born Chinese writing is grabbing America\n\n\nNow I think those were the issues uhm that I would consider and\nwithin me and us in particular uhm as a fiction house \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nNow thank you Anne\n\n\nI think that you know when the time comes to organise WICC2 uh you\nmay consider an additional question to the list of things to ponder and I\nwould like to suggest this question\n\n\nDo you want the anti-climax of a standard closing address at the\nend of the workshop\n\n\nAnd if the answer is a resounding no I think it will come as a\ngreat relief to me\n\n\n\n\n\nBut since I have uh receive your marching orders so to speak I\nshall have to press on somehow uh in my Singaporean fashion\n\n\nNow ladies and gentlemen you may recall that at the opening of this\nworkshop uh Dr Ban Kah Choon began by referring to the movie The Terminator\nand its science fiction terminology\n\n\nWell now at this final session I find myself playing terminator to\nthis workshop\n\n\nPerhaps I should say Terminator 2 since I'm only a stand-in for the\nDirector A/P Ong Jin Hui who is uh presently out of town\n\n\nWhich explains why a political scientist has been called upon to\nmake the closing speech at a workshop on lexicography\n\n\nWell the day before the start to this workshop I was actually on\nthe Borneo side now of the South China Sea Basin coordinating\n\n\nOr rather helping to wind down a workshop on regional security in\nthe post cold war concept\n\n\nIt seemed to me at the time that a lexicography workshop couldn't\nhave been more distant from our preoccupation with great power politics\n\n\nBut having sat through some very interesting and fascinating\nsessions of this workshop I must say that I have learned a lot uh from the\nremarkable similarity between the underlying issues\n\n\nAnd uh I am beginning to hope that more of my colleagues in\nPolitical Science could have been here\n\n\nAt one level we at this workshop have been reflecting on the\nfragmentation of empire\n\n\nIn this case the fragmentation of the language of an empire\n\n\nWithout making it too explicit we have touched on the international\nphenomenon of pluralization and the drift towards regionalization and\nmultiplurality\n\n\nThere is also an unmistakable ideological dimension to the\nostensibly simple question of whether there ought to be a dictionary of\nSingapore English\n\n\nThe rhetoric of those who forcibly argue for a change in the ground\nrules\n\n\nWhether ground rules governing the selection of words for inclusion\nor the ground rules of right pronunciation\n\n\nAll that rhetoric is reminiscent of the rhetoric of the North-South\ndebate\n\n\nAnd having listened to the comment by Dr this morning I am\nintrigued to compare the fate of English with other international languages\n\n\nDo other empires strike back to rebind the language that is\nincreasingly regionalized\n\n\nI wonder what would have happened if the French rather than the\nBritish were the colonisers of Singapore\n\n\nWill we now be renovating in style our dominant language the way\nthe Vietnamese are renovating their economy\n\n\nA point was made that eight years ago a project such as this would\nhave been quite unthinkable\n\n\nYet others have observed that this effort at corpora building\nreflects an aspect of national assertiveness greater confidence\n\n\nMaybe national identification maybe even a growth uh of a\nmiddle-class while agreeing that ideology should not stand in the way of\nprogress\n\n\nI think we should nevertheless be conscious that many of the\nquestions that revolve around the central issue of a dictionary of standard\nSingapore English has political implications or connotations\n\n\nWhy should we have such a dictionary in the first place\n\n\nPerhaps that question has already been overtaken uh by the events\nof this very workshop\n\n\nBut then we shall have to ask who should have a hand in deciding\nwhat should be included\n\n\nWhat is such a dictionary intending to serve\n\n\nIs it to be simply a record of regional English within a particular\nmulti-cultural setting at a particular period of time\n\n\nThe kind of zoo or supermarket situation that we were reflecting\nabout\n\n\nOr is it to be the final arbiter of what is acceptable Singapore\nEnglish\n\n\nHere in lies the issues of official status respectability and\nlegitimacy things that political scientists are very fond of talking about\n\n\nThen again we can ask what other implications of such an enterprise\nfor those in other disciplines who have the great essays written in English\nto be sure\n\n\nIdeology must not stand in the way of progress but I am also\nreminded that those who cannot read the writing on the wall must pay for\ntheir political illiteracy\n\n\nWhichever way we go from here the fact remains that there is a wide\nspectum of interests in the subject of this workshop\n\n\nAnd this is clearly indicated by the very strong representation of\nthe government sector\n\n\nIn particular the Ministry of Education the private publishing\nsector our sister institutions of higher learning NTU NIE RELC Ngee Ann Poly\nand so forth \n\n\nAnd also of course that bastion or outpost depending on how you\nlook at it of English the British Council of course one can say that this is\nthe kind of subject that everyone in the Arts and Social Sciences and beyond\nshould be interested in language afterall is the indispensable currency of\nsocial interaction but it takes a specialist and a particular kind of\nspecialist to tell us how to structure dictionary entries for discourse\nparticles like what and lah and lor and nei and in the course of an afternoon\nwe were also exposed to transitivity structures we considered mood adjuncts\nand delve into the meaning of finite verbal operators side by side by other\nexotica like theme rheme and mood residue fortunately we were told though in\na quite different context don't be concerned by the complicated appearnace of\nthese terms however simple words can also be rendered ambiguous by the social\ncultural context I think and this can be particularly maddening in the\nlanguage of intra-ASEAN diplomacy a colleague of mine who was here this\nmorning but uh who is no longer here is fond of recounting a recet incident\nin which the Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir attempted to solicited to\nsolicit support for his EastAsia Economic Group idea from President Suharto\nthe reply from the Indonesian President I will look into it which in the\nJavanese cultural context was as good as saying no perhaps we can reflect on\nthis kind of cross-cultural perception in our next dictionary of ASEAN\nEnglish but whether we go on to bigger things or settle for a dictionary of\nstandard Singapore English or one covering Malaysian-Singapore English the\nimportant thing is that with this workshop we have at least taken a tentative\nfirst step and here I am pleased that the CAS has in some very modest way\nbeen able to support a very useful project I should also uh acknowledge in\nthis connection the financial contribution given by John Wiley & Sons I would\nlike to thank Susan Butler for sharing her Marquarie experiences with uh with\nus and for her very active contributions uh to the department of English\nlanguage & literature special thanks uh for its consistent and strong support\nand also of course I should acknowledge the untiring work uh of our\nco-ordinator Anne Pakir I think after this workshop she should at least have\nthe confidence that when she goes back to the CAS for furhter support and we\nsay we will

{"text": "<$A> \n\nBasically I'll discuss on two topics\n\n\nThe first topic is the use of Singapore literature in relation to\nthe Singaporean dictionary of English\n\n\nAnd secondly I'll discuss the top ah uh I'll discuss the topic of\nthe users of the dictionary in relation to Singaporean literature in English\n\n\nUh I do not know if I've much time for the second part of it but\nI'll try my best uh uh say what I want to say uh in regard to both topics\n\n\nThere is a long established tradition of using works in of\nliterature as a source for citations in lexicography\n\n\nThe Arabic lexicographers in the eighth century for instance\nincluded citations from literary works in their dictionary\n\n\nAnd what has been regarded as a first of the big dictionaries of\nmodern standard languages\n\n\nAn Italian dictionary published in 1612 is based in words of\n\n\nAlmost exclusively on exception from the foreign time writers of the\nfourteenth century\n\n\nWhen it comes to lexicography in English from Dr Johnson's\ndictionary with his various quotations from literary works of English and of\nthe OED and its supplement and Webster's\n\n\nConsidering the long established tradition of the inclusion of data\nfrom literary works compilation of dictionaries\n\n\nIt does seems odd that apart from the panel discussion just now\nthere is only one people out of twenty in this workshop which deals with\nliterary works and lexicography\n\n\nLiterary works are even more important if one considers the\ninclusion of quotations from them in the dictionaries' citation files without\ntheir actual inclusion in the dictionary itself\n\n\nIt would thus be of interest for us to look at some of the general\nconceptions of principles involved whether explicit or implicit selection of\nlexicographic data from literary works\n\n\nAs looking at these conceptions of principles may help us to gain a\nclearer understanding of how one may use citations from literary works in the\nlexicographic files in relations to Singapore English\n\n\nAnd of deep potential problems that one may encounter here towards\nthe end of my talk\n\n\nI will also discuss the needs of the users for dictionary of\nSingaporean English in relations to Singapore literature with reference to\nthe use of literary works in lexicography maybe use\n\n\nIt may be helpful for us to look at the principles of selection of\nor attitudes towards data from literary works as it was practised in the\ncompilation of the supplement to the OED\n\n\nRobert Birchfield who is the general editor of supplement has\nmentioned about his decision uh to include the vocabulary of our greatest\nmodern writers in the supplement\n\n\nAmong them TS Eliot Virginia Woolf Evelyn Waugh WH Auden and even\nDylon Thomas and James Joyce except for most of\n\n\nI thought the lights would be off but anyway's still on the the\nquotation from Birchfield is interesting in relation to what he implies\nrather than what he's explicitly stated\n\n\nIn my view there are at least three important implications in what\nBirchfield has noted\n\n\nFirstly Birchfield's decision to include the works of our greatest\nmodern writers indicates the evau the evaluative bent in his selection of\nliterary works\n\n\nFrom which he collated his citations and touches on the important\nquestion on whether the lexicographer should engage in a prior evaluation of\nthe standing of the author or of the quality of his or her literary works\nbefore deciding to include quotations from the works in the dictionary\ncitation files\n\n\nAlthough I initially wanted to disagree with Birchfield I have come\nto the realization that this problem is unavoidable even today in 1980\n\n\nFor example noted that the conception of the good authors has come\nto stay and cannot be neg neglected in any lexicographic file\n\n\nThis principle of selection may be especially important if the\nlanguage or variety of the language uh has a great number of literary works\n\n\nThis may not be the case with Singaporean literature as yet but\nsome kind of prior evaluation of the works may be necessary so that the\nlexicographer is not inundated with data of ephemeral significance\n\n\nSome highly regarded literary works may continue to be read many\nyears after their publication and the lexicographer has a duty to explain a\nvery high percentage of lexical items found in these works\n\n\nIn this relation of a member of the lexicographic team has some\nprior training in literature and is capable of arriving at an evaluative\ndecision of works to include or exclude\n\n\nIn looking for data for the dictionary lexicographic files this\nprinciple of selection may be crucial if the lexicographic project one\nundertakes has a limited scope\n\n\nSecondly Birchfield's decision to include the works of our greatest\nmodern writers indicates the restriction to economical works from the British\nIsles\n\n\nWhich reveals that even a premier dictionary of English language\nsuch as the OED has has its cheap interest the desire to keep a written\nrecord of language and culture which centre on the British Isles\n\n\nBut there are bound to be less the thus there are bound to be less\ncitations from literary works by American writers when compared to citations\nfrom British and Irish authors except for an author like TS Eliot who lived\nin Britain for a good part of his life\n\n\nAnd one suspects that there are even less citations from authors\nwriting in English from other countries of the British Commonwealth when\ncompared to those from bri British and Irish authors\n\n\nThis revelation by Birchfield makes the decision to embark on a\ndictionary of other varieties of English uh apart from British Standard\nEnglish including a dictionary of Singaporean English even more urgent as the\nOED and its supplements can never give us a fair picture of English as it is\nspoken or in this case as it is written outside the British Isles\n\n\nThirdly the decision to include even Dylon Thomas and James Joyce\nwhen the important exclusion of much of Heeningan's wake touches on the\nextent or limit of the exclusion or otherwise of the creative use of the\nEnglish language and lexicography\n\n\nThe creative use of English may include nonce words or formations\nwhich appear only in certain literary works and virtually no where else\n\n\nIn this connection some of the neologisms created in the heyday of\nYing Mao Chin for instance may have to be excluded as they probably do not\nappear elsewhere in Singaporean English\n\n\nBut literary works may have an influence on the language people use\nand some nonce forma formations especially in popular literary works may\neventually find their way to everyday language\n\n\nFor example the word taximan can in Catherine uh Catherine Lim's\nThe Taximan's Story\n\n\nI suspect would be less likely to be included as part of the\nSingaporean English lexicon had Lim's story not been published as the lexical\nitem taxi driver or the word taxi as a sus substitute for taxi driver were\ndefinitely more common\n\n\nOn the other hand Arthur Yap's use of the verb intercept as a noun\nin his poem Banyan Tree and conversion of the noun drought into an adjective\nby adding the ed suffix as in droughted traveller in his poem The Meeting are\nmore likely to be nonce formations not found elsewhere in Singapore English\n\n\nOne major reason for the inclusion of citations from literary works\nin the lexicographer's citation files is the fact that many literary works\nthat needs traditionally and as we know them today are examples of or as in\nthe case of poetry and drama have a permanent manifestation in written\nlanguage\n\n\nThe fact remains that the main source of data in lexicography is\nstill the written\n\n\nIn the words of the lexicographer Sidney Landow dictionaries are\nnot based on spoken language\n\n\nThere are preeminently records of the written language\n\n\nThe situation today has not changed much\n\n\nIn 1986 for example Benson and noted that the best dictionary\nhouses has citation banks for written English but are just beginning to use\nspoken citations as lexicographic evidence\n\n\nThere has been criticism amongst linguists or more specifically\nlinguists with an interest in lexicography on the practice of including\nmainly citations from writ written language when when collating lexicographic\ndata\n\n\nWe have seen Jo Foley for example criticising this pro procedure on\nthe first day of this workshop\n\n\nBut as Susan Butler and other lexicographers have pointed out the\ncollation of data from written language has an enormous practical advantage\nover those from spoken language while not denying the importance of data from\nspoken language\n\n\nEspecially when time and generous funds are available\n\n\nCitations from written language are not only easier but also\ncheaper to collate\n\n\nIt may be countered that the dependence on written language may be\napplicable only to the main native varieties of English\n\n\nBut the Caribbean English dictionary which is a dictionary of a\nnon-native variety of English was according to Gustav planned to be based\nmostly on printed texts and quotations from such texts\n\n\nWritten texts also have the advantage of giving the lexicographic\ninformation from in terms of virtual stem of having arrived\n\n\nAs far as the language or dialect is concerned both practically and\npsychologically spoken words seem to hang in the air so to speak\n\n\nWhereas written words have a sense of permanence about them\n\n\nThis sense of permanency is even stronger when we are dealing with\nliterary works\n\n\nEspecially with works which are highly regarded as they are unlike\nnewspapers or magazines which are hardly read a few months after their\npublication\n\n\nThus Birchfield's desire to include the vocabulary of our greatest\nmodern writers is not merely an insupportable preconceived value judgement\nbut has a practical value in giving the lexicographer an idea of lexico items\nwhich have premanance or durability in relation to a language or dialect as\nhighly regarded literary works are read several years after their publication\n\n\nAlthough it must be added here that we cannot say for certain at\npresent which works of Singaporean English literature will be read fifty\nyears from now\n\n\nOr whether a canon of Singaporean literature in English which will\nensure the survival of some works is being developed or institutionalized\nassociated with the feeling of having arrived\n\n\nIn relation to uh to the written language is the fact that written\nlanguage gives the lexicographer an indication of how words are spelt\n\n\nThe problem of spelling colloquial le lexical items which have not\nbeen written down has incidentally touched on by Rosemary Khoo in her talk\nyesterday\n\n\nIn relation to this we must mention here that it is likely that\ncolloquial lexical items which have not been written down will make their\nfirst printed appearance in the literary work\n\n\nAnd thus the use of literary works in lexicography will make the\ntask of including these lexical items in the dictionary easier\n\n\nThe lexicographer who insists on including lexical items which have\nnot been written down may have to resort to the International Phonetic\nAlphabet or some such phonetic alphabet\n\n\nAnd he or she may have to resort to this means as the only means of\nspelling of the dictionary's main entries\n\n\nA practice which is quite odd to say the least or the lexical uh\nlexicographer could do something worse than this\n\n\nHe or she could invent the spelling of these words using the\nletters of the Romanized English alphabet even if these words have not\nappeared before\n\n\nIn a language like English or its varieties and dialects this may\nnot be viable as English spellings not phonetically based\n\n\nThe appearance of colloquial words in the written form in literary\nworks would thus be of immense help in giving the lexicographer an indication\nof how these words are spelt or the actual uses of the language or dialect\n\n\nWe may also note that Singaporean literature and English has the\nadvantage of being a living literature with a growing number of works\n\n\nThis gives the lexicographer more data to work on than a dialect\nwhich does not have a written literature \n\n\nSome Singaporean literary works in English are also quite popular\nover the years some local collections of short stories such as Catherine\nLim's Little Ironies and Philip Jeyaretnam's First Love had 5 figure sales\nand in the recently concluded annual festival books for examples some of the\nrecently published local literary books sold a few hundred copies per day\naccording to the figures released by the festival organisers in fact some of\nthe books such as Rex Shelley's Shrimp People and Gopal Baratham's Sayang\nhave sold 4000 copies each during the the exhibition and these two books in\nfact deserve more than just a passing lexicographical mention as Shelley's\nShrimp People has a useful glossary of lo local lexical items at the end of\nthe book and Gopal Ba uh Gopal Baratham with his book hoped that the word\nsayang will not only be part of Singaporean English which uh many of you\nagreed yesterday is uh it is already a part of but uh of international\nEnglish as well this is a hope inciden inci incidentally which is uh uh\nperhaps shared by Shirley Hew uh just now uh due to their popularity local\nliterary works may not only be a reflector of the English used by\nSingaporeans but may possibly have an influence on the use of the language in\nSingapore a factor which I mention earlier in relation to Catherine Lim's The\nTaximan's Story in spite of their advantages literary works may also present\nproblems to the lexicographer these problems however may not be universal\nlexicographic problems per se as I mean as as I can see it of course when it\ncomes to lexicography I am just a layman or universal problems one encounters\nwhenever one uses data from literary works but I suspect these are\ntheoretical and practical problems which may be either created or solved by\nthe kind of lexicographic work that one wants to compile and I think this has\nbeen emphasised by Susan Butler just now and the time of information that one\nwants to include in it they there may also be problems in relation to the\nnature of language in general and the language or dialect that one is dealing\nwith in particular the kind of dictionary that one deals with may hinge on\nwhether one wants to include an encyclopedic information this inci\nincidentally has been mentioned by Dr Ban in his opening address it has been\ndiscussed uh yesterday by the workshop participants and whether the lexical\nitems should be arranged conceptually as in uh thesaurus and not merely\nalphabetically the kind of dictionary that one deals with may also hinge on\nthe extent of the dictionaries thoroughness exhaustiveness or scope and on\nits uh intended readership and I think this is the precise point made by\nSusan Butler just now the pre the predetermined scope of the dictionary may\ndetermine for instance whether citations from literary works or citations in\ngeneral should be included or excluded if they're included then they become\nrather scholarly like the OED or Websters intend international version in\nthis connection I have also mentioned earlier that the prior evaluation of\nliterary works may be crucial for dealing with a dictionary of a limited\nscope I would be dealing with the potential user of the dictionary of\nSingaporean English in relations to Singaporean literature later in my talk\nbut we may mention here that the intended readership of the dictionary may be\na highly specialised one in this regard the dictionary of English as it is\nused in Singaporean English literature or more general dictionary of\nSingaporean English as it is as it is found in the literature it's an\nacademic likelihood which may possibly be re be realised in the not so\ndistant future the type of information to be put in the dictionary which in\nturn has been predetermined by the scope of the dictionary may centre on the\nquestion of whether one should include information on collocation grammar\nslang and so on one may also consider whether to indicate if the lexical item\nbelongs to standard or non standard Singaporean English usage or whether\nthere is a regional variation on the lexical items used that one should\ndecide whether to include information on regional variation may seem bizarre\nat first sight but uh uh uh most of you have uh attended some of the earlier\nsessions and you know that this is uh uh a problem which uh anyone dealing\nwith uh uh Singaporean lexical items face the primary difficulty here of\ncourse is uh the distinction between English as it is spoken in Singapore and\nEnglish as it as it is spoken in Malaysia uh and in fact this problem is in\nfact compounded and not helped by the fact that Singaporean literature in\nEnglish and Malaysian literature in English are quite often taken especially\nin the past as one literature and not as two separate literatures for example\nEdwin Thumboo's three collections of poetry the Flowering Tree Seven Poets\nand the Second Tongue publishes respectively in 1970 73 and 76 or include\npoets writing in English from both Malaysia and Singapore in spite of the\nfact that all three volumes were published after Singapore's separation from\nMalaysia even today the general commonwealth literature still discusses\nSingaporean and Malaysian literatures together in its annual review studies\nof the literatures of the two countries I suspect that the lexicographer of\nSingaporean English cannot simply ignore the earlier works in English by\nMalaysian writers such as Mohamed Haji Salim Lord Llyod Frenando as there did\nnot seem to be a sharp division between both the literatures in English and\nthe English dialects of the two countries until recent years I myself picked\nan example from the poem by Mohamed Haji Saleh earlier in my talk in order to\ndetermine the possibility of his inclusion in the Singaporean English lexicon\nhowever certain lexical items may mainly occur in Malaysian English and not\nin Singaporean English such lexical items should be labelled strictly as\nMalaysian as has been suggested I think yesterday in this workshop and not\nsimply excluded especially when one is dealing with a dictionary which has a\nwide scope as one cannot entirely preclude the possibility of the occurrence\nin the English spoken by Singaporeans one possible solution to the\nSingapore-Malaysia problem as has been sug suggested by Susan Butler and also\nby I think uh Anthea Gupta is to have a dictionary of both Singaporean and\nMalaysian English in one volume another linguistic factor which may prove\neither to be a help or hindrance to the lexicographer oif Singaporean English\nusing Singaporean literary works in English is the codification of the\nstandard language as far as Singaporean English as a non-native variety is\nconcerned now many of the workshop participants have discussed this and many\nof them agree that the standard for language or variety of the language goes\nhand in hand with a dictionary of the language or variety", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nFriends this election is not about a mandate for the PAP or for\neven Mr Goh Chok Tong\n\n\nThe PAP have 41 seats\n\n\nThey have the mandate and they are the government for another 5\nyears\n\n\nIf you can believe their promises this election is now about whether\nwe the people of Singapore will be able to send a few opposition members to\nparliament to perform the correct role and job\n\n\nThe opposition should make the political system that we have in\nSingapore is based on an assumption that there will be always at least two\nparties in parliament\n\n\nIf there is not then checks and balances which the system provides\nwill not work effectively\n\n\nThere will be no harmony in parliament\n\n\nThere will be no balance\n\n\nIt is not enough to have one opposition MP\n\n\nThat is like asking one man to hold back the river or the sea by\nhimself he can do nothing\n\n\nBut if there are others to help him he can build the wall\n\n\nHe can build the dam and stop the water\n\n\nHow does an opposition MP do this\n\n\nHe does it by getting the support of many Singaporeans\n\n\nHe explains why a government policy is a bad policy or could be\nimproved\n\n\nIf the people support him he can speak on their behalf\n\n\nAnd with many people behind him the government must listen and they\nhave listened before\n\n\nChiam See Tong and J.B. Jeyaratnam went to parliament\n\n\nWe the people had no voice there was no\n\n\nToday in parliament ministers did not explain policies to you and\nme\n\n\nThe government just told us what we had to do and fine us if we did\nnot do it\n\n\nThey used to force people to cut their hair in the sixties and\nseventies\n\n\nThey used to tell people what sort of T-shirts to wear\n\n\nThey told women who work in the civil service not to wear pants or\nslacks to work\n\n\nThere was no consultation and no feedback\n\n\nThey never held dialogue sessions with you in the past\n\n\nThose were the dark ages\n\n\nNow things have changed\n\n\nThey know that they must listen to you because if they do not there\nare opposition MPs who will make your voice heard\n\n\nWe now have a slightly more open and freer society\n\n\nIt is not a gift from the PAP it is a necessity\n\n\nYou the people of Singapore made them change by putting opposition\nmembers in parliament\n\n\nWe now in the middle ages of our political development but we must\ncome into the modern world\n\n\nWe must have a modern political system to match our modern economy\n\n\nWe saw what happened in the sixties and seventies when the PAP was\nthe only party in power\n\n\nThey did not listen and if there is no opposition the PAP will not\nlisten to the voice of the old and the sick who cannot afford the new\nhospital and medical charges\n\n\nOver a year ago the PAP introduced a hospital privatisation scheme\n\n\nThey said we will the hospital more efficient but they did not tell\nyou that they will the hospital more expensive and their efficiency in the\nPAP bible name pay and pay\n\n\nThe opposition members of parliament warned that this will be a\ngreat burden on the poor and those people who were chronically ill\n\n\nThe PAP removed nearly all the C class beds\n\n\nNow they have discovered that we were right and in today's Straits\nTimes the PAP say that they are prepared to look again at the health policy\nthe old premises and assumptions can be looked at again\n\n\nWhy should the policy be reexamined again unless it was wrong in\nthe first place\n\n\nLet me give you an example\n\n\nA lot of people who passed away many years ago were of people who\nare dying now in Potong Pasir\n\n\nA lady came to me\n\n\nShe was unable to pay her conservancy charges\n\n\nHer husband was dying of bone cancer she herself was sick her\ndaughter and her son-in-law were working at two jobs just to pay the hospital\nbills and the husband was only a C class patient\n\n\nI asked her about her medisave\n\n\nShe said we have no more medisave they cannot pay their bills\n\n\nI am very sad to say I was not able to help her but this is the\nposition of many people in Singapore\n\n\nIt is very frightening to get sick if you are the sole bread winner\nthe only earner\n\n\nIf you fall sick your family can be thrown out into the streets to\npoverty\n\n\nAnd if there is no opposition the PAP will not listen to the voice\nof the non-graduate mother whose children do not have priority for\nregistration to the best primary schools\n\n\nIsn't it unfair that the children of better-off families whose\nparents are more able to afford good tuition and give their children a good\nstudy environment should also get priority for schools\n\n\nWhere is the equality\n\n\nDo you realise that if he was 6 six years today Goh Chok Tong would\nnot get priority in primary one registration because his mother was not a\ngraduate\n\n\nIf Mr Goh Chok Tong really believes people-bonding if he really\nbelieves that the well-off and the successful must come back and help those\nwho are not so well-off\n\n\nHow can he let such an unfair system continue\n\n\nAnd if there is no opposition the PAP will not listen to the voice\nof the working mother who is paying a high levy for foreign maids so that she\ncan go out and earn that little bit more to make the family's ends meet\n\n\nThere are a whole range of issues where we need an opposition in\nparliament to bring out the issues to question the PAP\n\n\nThese are matters like independent schools\n\n\nThe independent schools are not necessarily a bad thing but should\nindependent schools be allowed to take the best teachers away from the\nordinary schools\n\n\nUniversities we had a 100% increase in university tuition fees\nrecently and they had 3 increases since 1987\n\n\nYou have of course heard of the half tank rule now called the\nthree-quarter rule\n\n\nWatch out it will soon be the full-tank rule and higher HDB parking\ncharges 25 dollars to 50 dollars\n\n\nNow all of these things I have just mentioned have something in\ncommon\n\n\nThey all happened after a general election\n\n\nI think it is very strange that when the PAP offers to give you\nback your own CPF money in medisave or medifund they said wait vote for me\nfirst I need your mandate then I will give you your money\n\n\nBut they never ask you for your mandate when they take money form\nyou\n\n\nThis is a real double standard\n\n\nThink about it\n\n\nThey never ask you for your endorsement when they take money from\nyour pocket\n\n\nI have said that Mr Chaim See Tong that this election is not a\ngeneral election because it does not affect who will be the government\n\n\nThere is no need for the PAP to get a mandate to rule\n\n\nThey have it already\n\n\nMr Goh had admitted this and changed his tactic\n\n\nHe now says he wants the people to endorse him\n\n\nHe says that he is the issue in this election not medisave medifund\nedusave but he Goh Chok Tong he says that it is his open consultative style\nfreer more liberal Singapore\n\n\nI don't know about you but I think there are still so many rules\nand regulations binding us all the time\n\n\nI haven't seen much of this more liberal Singapore\n\n\nMaybe the only thing we have seen are the R movies that's all and\neven this they are thinking of changing\n\n\nMr Goh hints to us other people have hinted to us that if you do\nnot support Goh Chok Tong then the PAP are hardliners might oust him in a\ncoup\n\n\nMaybe this is why Mr Goh has changed his campaign slogan in the\nmiddle of a campaign\n\n\nHe added a little word for stability\n\n\nMr Goh Chok Tong has been watching too much CNN television\n\n\nHe thinks he is President Gorbachev\n\n\nMaybe he thinks BG Lee is going to overthrow him\n\n\nWhat happened in Russia is a lesson for us here\n\n\nIt shows that the people were not prepared to allow a return to\none-party rule there even when they have to look at tanks and armoured cars\nin their face\n\n\nIt was the democratically elected opposition that saved Mr\nGorbachev and the Soviet Union from his own party hardliners\n\n\nI am talking about Boris Yeltsin who for many years has been the\nstrongest critic and the strongest opponent of Mr Gorbachev\n\n\nBut it was this critic and opponent who climbed on to the Russian\ntanks condemned the coup and restored democracy to Russia not members of Mr\nGorbachev's own party\n\n\nThe lesson for us is that you cannot place all your trust in one\nman whether he is called Goh or Gorbachev\n\n\nIf there is a one-party monopoly his own party might try to stab\nhim in the back\n\n\nBut if you have a parliamentary system with a strong and stable\nopposition you can reduce the chances that hardline clique inside the ruling\nparty\n\n\nWhether it is the communist party or the PAP reduce the chances\nthat they have to overthrow the system\n\n\nIn other words if somebody powerful in the PAP intends to stab Mr\nGoh in the back do you think there is any PAP back-bencher who has the\ncourage to stop the hand that's holding the knife\n\n\nThese PAP back-benchers although they appear to speak up against\ngovernment sometimes always follow the party line when the party whip is\napplied to them\n\n\nYes you think PAP MPs say amazing things yesterday\n\n\nDr Arthur Beng said that the PAP needs the party whip otherwise it\nmight get toppled by its own back-benchers\n\n\nYah go read the Straits Times\n\n\nIf there is so much chaos don't you think we have a right to know\nwhether there is so much chaos in the PAP that they might be toppled by their\nown back-benchers\n\n\nAnd who will find out what is going on except your opposition who\nask the embarrassing questions of the PAP\n\n\nAre you having an internal power struggle to which they only reply\nweak answers\n\n\nAnd as Mr Chiam See Tong has said Mr Goh Chok Tong himself is not\nabove making foolish statements\n\n\nIt was reported in today's papers saying that the opposition might\nwin all 40 contested seats and that this will mean that the PAP had no\nmandate and that he would have to step down as Prime Minister in favour of\nsomeone\n\n\nMr Goh has forgotten something\n\n\nLet me remind him of basic parliamentary factors in the unlikely\nsituation that Mr Ramasamy's Justice Party beats him\n\n\nHe won't even be an MP and do you know why Mr Goh Chok Tong forgot\nthat\n\n\nBecause he really doesn't believe that he is going to lose\n\n\nHe really doesn't believe that the opposition might win 40 seats\n\n\nThe reality is that we may that the PAP will win many of these 40\nseats what\n\n\nThe hope is is that the opposition can win some of them\n\n\nThis is what we are talking about the system in Singapore\n\n\nWe are lucky that we have a political system based on a tried and\ntested model the British western system\n\n\nThe system that has been tested over hundreds of years\n\n\nIn Russia the old guards tried to introduce a new system based on\nthe dominance of one single party\n\n\nThis party controls everything from trade union to public\ntransport and health\n\n\nIt took them 70 years before they realise that the system did not\nwork and by then the damage was done here\n\n\nIn Singapore we do not have 70 years\n\n\nOne slip by the PAP we might be finished unless there is an\nopposition to check the excesses of government \n\n\nAn opposition to speak up for all people whom the PAP does not\nlisten to an opposition to tell the government when

and then to decide\nwhether and how to continue with my open consultative style of government\n\n\nPersonally I'm disappointed that I got to perhaps modify my style\nof government\n\n\nI'm reluctant to do so cos' that's my personality\n\n\nThat's something which I believe in\n\n\nI still would like to pursue the style of government but obviously\nsince I did not get a strong endorsement for this I would have to make\nmodifications to my style\n\n\nBesides my leadership the major issue which arose in this election\nwas the use of gut feelings of race and religion in Singapore gut feelings of\nrace and religion in Singapore\n\n\nJufrie Mahmood Workers' Party candidate for Eunos GRC made use of\ncommunal and religious tools to win Malay votes\n\n\nI took a strong stand against him\n\n\nI felt very strongly that that is a wrong way to campaign and that\nif you allow one candidate to do so other candidates would follow very\nquickly and this will lead to big trouble\n\n\nThe Workers' Party and SDP decided/united in it became abundantly\nclear during the election campaign that the Eunos results would be seen as I\nput it during the campaign\n\n\nA test case as to whether the people of Singapore or in this case\nthe people of Eunos condone a communal approach to politics or reject it\n\n\nWell the PAP won in Eunos but by a very small margin\n\n\nI find it incomprehensible that on this basic issue we should win\nonly by a small margin\n\n\nIt shows that many voters in Eunos GRC have not understood the\ngravity of communal politics\n\n\nThe danger this trend holds for Singapore\n\n\nI'm deeply concerned for the implications for the future shape of\npolitics in a multi-racial Singapore\n\n\nOver several days we argued openly over this fundamental issue that\nin elections no candidate should use communal religious pulls to work on the\ngut feel of race and religion\n\n\nI cannot understand the results in Eunos GRC even though we won and\nI'm fearful of what it portends for Singapore in the future\n\n\nBut what is clear is that the strategy of Mr Chiam See Tong has\nworked\n\n\nMr Chiam See Tong used a strategy that the PAP was given the\nmandate to govern and that this was a by-election\n\n\nAnd because he succeeded in focussing voters' minds on the fact\nthat this was a by-election the attitude of the voters changed\n\n\nAnd that attitude changed on the validity of nomination when you\nreturned back a government\n\n\nHe asked them to vote for the opposition and from the results you\ncould that wherever there were plausible or wherever there were credible\ncandidates or even possible ones the voters decided to vote for them\n\n\nThere is now a proper opposition in parliament and Mr Chiam can\nrightly claim to be its leader\n\n\nHe will be the leader of the opposition in parliament\n\n\nThe ground rules have changed\n\n\nThose who are opposed to the government can now have the official\nopposition to work through the PAP self-imposed opposition role is now over\n\n\nIn other words PAP MPs have no further need to play opposition in\nparliament\n\n\nThis role will be taken over by Mr Chiam and his opposition members\nof parliament\n\n\nLike government parliamentary parties in other Commonwealth\ncountries the PAP's role will now be that of a conventional governing party\nin a two-party political partisan situation\n\n\nThis is a new situation\n\n\nI've seen in the cam campaign that if we lose ten seats and our\npercentage falls below 55% that life will not be as before\n\n\nLife cannot go on as before\n\n\nThat was what I said during the election campaign\n\n\nWe did not lose ten seats we did not lose 8% of the votes from the\nlast time\n\n\nBut in my view life cannot be as before\n\n\nCertain things have to change\n\n\nNow how they will change I do not know tonight but I feel that\npolitics in Singapore cannot go on as before\n\n\nIt's a new situation now\n\n\nWe have to face this\n\n\nI myself am of course personally disappointed but nevertheless it\nis still quite a relief that the results were what they were\n\n\nIt could have been worse\n\n\nNow I'll take on some questions\n\n\nWill you want to say a few words in uh Mandarin\n\n\nUh I think maybe say a few words in Mandarin say a few words in\nmandarin if you want to\n\n\nYou're good in Chinese\n\n\nI'm not good in Chinese\n\n\nPut it in Chinese\n\n\nUh just one minute I think I would uh ask my colleague to say a few\nwords in Mandarin \n\n\nOng Teng Cheong spoke in Mandarin  \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nThe Next Lap sets out what we want Singapore to be in the next\ngeneration\n\n\nMy government will translate these long-term goals into immediate\nprograms so that Singaporeans will be better off by the end of this term of\nParliament Standards of living have risen rapidly in Singapore\n\n\nJobs have been plentiful\n\n\nNearly everyone owns his own home complete with telephone and\ntelevision\n\n\nCPF and POSB savings have gone up\n\n\nStandards of health care have risen\n\n\nMore students are making it to secondary schools and into\npolytechnics and universities\n\n\nAll this has been achieved because sound government policies have\ncreated a framework for sustained growth and enable Singaporeans to progress\nand prosper\n\n\nBut we are only half-way up to becoming a developed country\n\n\nThe more difficult half remains ahead of us\n\n\nWe can only get there as one united nation Singaporeans naturally\ncompete to do well individually and get ahead\n\n\nBut we must also work together to succeed as a group and to\nstrngthen the bonds among us\n\n\nWe must encourage the more able to do their best for themselves and\nfor Singapore\n\n\nBut the more able must also need to show concern for the others and\nhelp them to catch up\n\n\nWe should level up to progress not level down to stagnate\n\n\nThe government will play an essential role It will reward drive and\nenterprise and give each Singaporean the incentive to excel\n\n\nIt will invest heavily in educaiton and human resources so that\neach one can acquire the right knowledge and skill be self-reliant and earn\nmore\n\n\nThe government will also to build up the assets of Singaporeans by\nupgrading and increasing the value of their HDB homes\n\n\nThis will give every citizen a share of the wealth we have created\ntogether and strengthen his stake in Singapore\n\n\nHowever while the government will subsidize investments like\neducation and infrastructure it will not subsidize consumption expenditure\n\n\nTo do so is to undermine the traditional virtues of thrift personal\nresponsibility and the will to achieve and to weaken our economy\n\n\nThe experience of other countries has proved this again and again\n\n\nEducation is the foundation of competitiveness\n\n\nIt is not eh one of exercise but the life-long process as we\nacquire new knowledge and skills to keep up with new technology and adapt to\nnew economic changes\n\n\nSchool results have steadily improved as we raise teaching\nstandards and refine the education system\n\n\nDemand for higher education has increased\n\n\nThe Institute of Technical Education will be formed this year to\ntrain not only fresh school leavers but older workers who want to upgrade\ntheir skills and their jobs\n\n\nA fourth polytechnic will be set up this year\n\n\nNUS and NTU have increased their intakes and will expand further as\nmore qualified students graduate from schools\n\n\nThe Singapore Open University will admit students starting this\nyear to give adults who missed out on a tertiary education a second chance to\nwork for university degrees\n\n\nEducation is an investment in our people\n\n\nWe must invest more in our most promising students while looking\nafter the needs of the less able\n\n\nIn schools we need to give parents a wider range of choices so\nthat their children can receive the education best tailored to their\nindividual needs\n\n\nThis is the rationale for the independent schools and the Edusave\nscheme\n\n\nWe need to develop the independent schools into outstanding\ninstitutions to give the most promising and able students an education\nmatching their promise\n\n\nAdmission to these schools must be based principally on merit not\nability to pay\n\n\nNo bright child from a poor home need lose his chance to study in\nan independent school\n\n\nThere'll be scholarships and bursaries for him\n\n\nAttention paid to independent schools will not be at the expense\nof the other schools\n\n\nInstead the other schools will benefit from ideas tested out\nsuccessfully in the independent schools\n\n\nBy demonstrating what is possible the independent schools will\nhelp other schools to raise standards\n\n\nThe government will widen the Edusave scheme to achieve these\nobjectives\n\n\nIt had previously announced that every year the scheme will\ncontribute a sum to the Edusave account of each individual student\n\n\nIn addition Edusave will now fund two types of scholarships\n\n\nOne scholarship will be for top pupils going to independent\nschools\n\n\nThey will be chosen based on academic merit from among the best\nstudents in the country regardless of family background\n\n\nOne quarter of the pupils in independent schools will receive such\nscholarships which will cover the school fees\n\n\nThe second type of scholarship will be for students going to\nnonindependent secondary schools\n\n\nThis scholarship can be awarded on the constitutuency or school\nbasis to grassroots organizations and school advisory or management\ncommittees\n\n\nIn this way good students in many schools and not just the\noutstanding students in independent schools will be recognised and encouraged\nto put in their best efforts\n\n\nBesides awarding scholarships Edusave will also make annual grants\nto government and government-aided secondary schools\n\n\nThe schools will have discretion to use these grants for example\nto hire extra specialist staff for additional equipment like computers or for\nbursaries to help needy students\n\n\nThey can be equipped more like independent schools\n\n\nTo fund these new schemes the annual Edusave contribution to\nindividual accounts will be correspondingly reduced\n\n\nNearly every Singaporean now owns the home he lives in\n\n\nThe government will refurbish and upgrade the older HDB estates to\napproximate the quality of newer estates like Pasir Ris and Bishan \n\n\nDemonstration projects will be launched later this year If they\nare popular with residents HDB will upgrade other neighbourhoods which want\nto do so over the next ten to fifteen years Meanwhile we can make many\nimprovements to existing estates to spruce up common areas and improve\nessential facilities for example by water-proofing bathroom floors These\ninvestments will enhance the value of HDB homes and increase the assets of\nSingaporeans Many Singaporeans living in HDB flats wish to upgrade to private\nhousing Government will sell more land to private developers for condominiums\nand landed property developments Besides homes HDB has also built many\nshophouses but so far it has only sold a few of them to the shopkeepers As\nlandlord HDB has periodically needed to raise the rents of these shophouses\ncausing difficulties to some tenants To solve these problems HDB will sell\nmost of these shophouses to the tenants The price will be related to the\nmarket values of the properties with an appropriate discounts This will\nenable the shopowners to paln ahead with certainty One area of concern to\nSingaporeans is health care as incomes rise and the population ages the\ndemand for medical care will inevitably go up As wages of medical staff go up\nso will costs so will national expenditure on health care This has happened\nin every country sorry Singapore's per capita income is only half that of the\nUnited States and Japan Yet the subsidised wards of government hospitals\nalready offer better medical care than most Japanese hospitals Lower income\nSingaporeans enjoy medical care than many American families who cannot afford\nmedical insurance and have no access to good hospitals The government will\nensure that all Singaporeans receive bais medical care It will continue to\nsubsidise B2 and C class wards though it will still have to revise charges\nfor the wards from time to time There is a limit to the level of medical care\nwhich the government can guarantee every citizen The state cannot afford\nunlimited subsidies for high technology medicine especially treatments which\nare recently discovered and not yet established Every dollar spent on these\nareas is a dollar less for other proven basic and cost-effective procedures\nPatients who want non-standard treatments will have to pay for them at\nnon-subsidised rates or depend on the private sector Governments which ahve\nprovided free medical care for their citizens like Canada Britain Spain and\nother devloped countries more affluent than we are all face serious\ndifficulties Sweden after seventy years of state welfare plans to reform its\nsystem of governmentfunded free health care Even communist China intends to\nstart charging government employees for medical care No state can meet the\ninsatiable demand for health care The burden of the ever increasing\nexpenditures ultimately falls back on the people We must learn from these\npainful experiences of other countries Our medical care system must create\nmaximum incentive for responsibility and minimum temptation to waste The\nindividual has a personal responsibility to keep fit stay healthy minimise\nthe need for medical treatment and save for his own medical expenses The\nfirst report from the Review Committee on national health policies emphasised\npreventive medicine and healthy living The government has accepted this\nreport and will launch an annual national campaign for healthy lifestyles\nthis year We have restructured government hospitals to provide medical care\nmore efficiently and economically The trend is for the private sector to play\na bigger role in providing health care and competing against government\nhospitals as it haas done in obstetrics More than half the babies in\nSingapore are born in private hospitals Singaproeans who have Medisave have\ngenerally been able to meet their medical expenses especially if they also\nhave Medishield But the self-employed are not covered by Medisave The\ngovernment will extend Medisave to as many self-employed workers as possible\nIn the long-term the Medisave contirbution rate of six percent will be\ninsufficient The government will raise Medisave contribution rates\nprogressively especially for older Singaporeans who have already got their\nhomes The government will set up a new endowment fund called Medifund to\ncomplement Medisave Income from the endowment will be used to help poorer\nSingaporeans whose Medisave accounts are insufficient to meet their medical\nexpenses and who need help as a last resort Medifund will be an extension of\nthe existing scheme of fee waivers for C and B2 class wards This will provide\na safety net for Singaporeans Help from Medifund will not be an entitlement\nEach application to Medifund will be assesssed individually by a committee\ninvolving community leaders to decide how much help is needed Inkeeping with\nthe principle of personal responsibility Medifund will give priority to\nhelping those who have consistently contributed to their own Medisave\naccounts This will be an additional incentive for self-employed Singaporeans\nto contribute to Medisave For older Singaporeans who retired before Medisave\nwas fully introduced Medifund will be more flexible The changes in Singapore\nsociety had been rapid Sometimes people feel disorientated and have to\nstruggle to keep up But the pace of change is not dictated by Singapore alone\nThe entire Asia-Pacific region is undergoing dramatic change Other countries\nlike South Korea Taiwan Malaysia and Thailand are advancing even more rapidly\nthan Singapore and catching up on us If we choose a more relaxed pace we must\nbe prepared to be overtaken and left behind To stay ahead we must constantly\nrestructure and upgrade Sustaining growth depends on pursuing efficient\nmarket-oriented economic policies People sometimes these policies for paying\ninadequate attention to social and human factors But these are the very\npolicies which have created the prosperity we enjoy today The communist\ncountries pursued the opposite policies ignoring market forces and\neliminating income differences by government order They created poverty and\ndespair Many have collapsed The government cannot hold back change but it\nwill help Singaporeans to adapt to change It cannot protect local businesses\nagainst foreign competition but it will help them to restructure and compete\nIt cannot preserve redundant jobs where technology or market demand has\nchanged but it can help affected workers to retrain and find new jobs While\nwe constantly upgrade and adjust the changing world conditions we must not\nunthinkingly cut ourselves off from our cultural roots Government policies\nmust always enjoy the broad support of the major social groups including the\nless vocal non-English speaking part of our society Now that the economy is\nmore developed growth is becoming more difficult Despite our best efforts the\neconomy will slow down Where previously eight percent growth was normal in\nthe next phase five to seven percent growth will be very good While we work\nharder to upgrade and become more productive so must also moderate our\nexpectations of wage increase In recent years wages have been increased by as\nmuch as ten percent per year but this cannot be sustained over the long-term\nThe labour market is still tight but eventually wages will have to slow down\nto match productivity and economic growth Otherwise we'll be we will be\nchasing our own tails and higher wages will cause higher inflation without\nimproving standards of living Implementing policies to carry Singapore\nforward in the next lap depends on an efficient and professional civil\nservice which can attract and challenge some of the most able Singaporeans to\ncontribute their best to Singapore The present civil service arrangements for\nrecruiting promoting and managing personnel centred on the Public Service\nCommission and the Public Service Division were inherited from the colonial\ngovernment The arrangements are over-centralised and too rigid to cope with a\nrapidly changing labour market They give more weight to internal civil\nservice relativities between unrelated vocations than to fault the market\njudges the jobs to be worth despite periodic salary revisions the civil\nservice is unable to recruit all the talent it needs and pay them market\nrates In Britain the civil service commission has delegated most of its\nauthority to ministries and departments and retain responsibility for only\nfifteen percent of recruitment Malaysia which inherited similar arrangements\nas ours has amended its constitution to delegate civil service promotions to\nministries The Malaysian PSC is only responsible for recruitment We must make\nfundamental changes to the management of the Singapore Civil Service and free\nup its personnel administration The public sector must become a more\nresponsive and competitive employer without compromising the integrity and\nimpartiality of the civil service and the statutory boards We are entering a\nnew phase of Singapore's devlopment We have successfully overcome the basic\nchallenges of the firts twenty-five years of independence schools housing\nsecurity jobs and basic health care We have built up substantial reserves and\ncreated an elected presidency with powers to give some protection to these\nreserves Now we face new challenges How to strengthen national consensus\ndespite the absence of visible danger How to remind Singaporeans that the\nbasics have not changed however secure our prosperity may appear How to\nremain agile and keen even though we are no longer lean and hungry How to be\na meritocratic but not an individualistic society How to maintain the pace of\nupgrading so that Singapore will become a developed country and all will be\nbetter-off by the end of the century The new generation of Singaporeans must\nfind fresh answers to these challenges amidst tumultuous international\nchanges", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nThe year 1990 will long be remembered as a special year by\nSingaporeans the University and of course by you the new graduates\n\n\nFor Singaporeans it marks the silver jubilee of our nationhood and\n25 years of successful unrelenting efforts at nation-building\n\n\nFor the University it signifies 10 years of extraordinary growth and\ndevelopment following the merger of our two predecessor universities\n\n\nAnd for the new graduates it means the crowning glory of 16 years of\nformal education and launching into the exciting world of work\n\n\nTogether they call for jubilant celebrations and all three are\nactually related\n\n\nA prosperous Singapore has provided the necessary support for the\nUniversity galvanised by the merger to offer the quality education which\namply prepares graduates to take on the challenges that lie ahead of them\n\n\nAnd the success of the well-prepared graduates in turn helps to\nsustain and enhance the prosperity of Singapore itself\n\n\nThus completing the circle of happy relationships\n\n\nThe success of graduates in the world of work does depend on\nopportunities which are determined to a large extent by the state of the\ncountry's economy\n\n\nAs our national economy has remained sound opportunities for work\nare plentiful for our graduates\n\n\nI expect the great majority if not all of you are already gainfully\nemployed\n\n\nAs engineers you are particularly in great demand because industry\nhas become increasingly high-tech and knowledge-intensive as it develops and\nindustrial R&D is fast gathering momentum\n\n\nIn fact market forces have conspired to place engineers in the\nranks of top earners among the new graduates\n\n\nWith the recent upturn in the construction industry there is now\neven talk of shortage of good civil engineers in the profession\n\n\nThese buoyant features of our economy however should not blind us\nto our vulnerability to rapid unexpected changes in the world at large as\nrecent events in the Middle East have again shown\n\n\nGraduates while rightly committed to training for their chosen\ncareers should always remain alert and mentally nimble\n\n\nAnd be prepared to adapt to re-learn and to meet unfamiliar\nchallenges\n\n\nFor the latter I am confident your university education will stand\nyou in good stead\n\n\nYou have been equipped with an inquiring analytical mind capable of\ninnovation and independent learning\n\n\nAnd you should be ready to make your mark in society under any\ncondition\n\n\nIn the first 10 years of its existence NUS itself has successfully\nmet new demands and thrived on fresh challenges\n\n\nTo support the targeted ambitious socio-economic growth of our\nnation the University has had to produce quality manpower in sufficient\nnumbers\n\n\nOver this period undergraduate enrolment in the University has\nincreased by some 80 per cent from 8,634 to 15,298\n\n\nTo maintain and enhance the quality of education teaching staff has\nmore than doubled from 602 to 1,389\n\n\nAnd various schemes and measures such as student feedback on\nteaching and courses consultation with faculty advisory committees seminars\nand workshops on teaching skills adjunct teaching appointments from outside\nthe University compulsory practical training and computer-based learning have\nbeen introduced\n\n\nCreativity and innovation have been nurtured through challenging\nprojects and open-ended experiments in the laboratories\n\n\nWhile the recently introduced optional enrichment courses broaden\nthe intellectual horizon\n\n\nThe favourable outcome is reflected in the high regard with which\nNUS degrees are held by professional bodies internationally by employers and\nby other universities\n\n\nThe increasing sophistication and the high technology thrust of our\neconomic development have brought about a growing demand for more specialised\nmanpower\n\n\nThis has been matched by a four-fold increase in the postgraduate\nenrolment in the University from 536 to 2,241 over the last 10 years\n\n\nOf the 671 postgraduates pursuing Masters' or Phds by research\nabout three quarters are in Engineering Medicine and Science indicating that\na thriving research culture particularly in these disciplines has developed\nin the context of the increasing importance of R & D to our economy\n\n\nThe establishment of ISS in 1981 IMCB in 1987 and the several\nresearch centres for other subjects have markedly reinforced the research\nculture\n\n\nStaff research output has increased more than three-fold with\nsignificantly higher percentage of publications appearing in journals\nincluded in the Science and Social Sciences Citation indices\n\n\nResearch efforts have focused on certain chosen niches and\nimportant break-throughs have been achieved\n\n\nBacked by its large body of experts and its comprehensive and\nup-to-date facilities and equipment\n\n\nThe University has in the last 10 years rapidly stepped up\ncollaboration with industry and outside organisations in R & D and\ncommercialisation of research findings\n\n\nAs well as in providing consultation services transferring\ntechnology and organising specialist up-date courses\n\n\nIn addition the Faculties have held frequent lectures and seminars\non practical topics and issues to which interested parties outside the\nUniversity were invited\n\n\nThese seminars often multidisciplinary in nature and involving\nseveral Faculties have proved very popular and fruitful\n\n\nThe last 10 years have also seen a healthy growth in another aspect\nof University life\n\n\nRegular lunch-time performances of music dance and drama which\ncommenced in 1985\n\n\nArt exhibitions the expanded activities of the Centre for Musical\nActivities and the recently opened Lee Kong Chian Art Museum have all\ncontributed to bringing about a culturally vibrant campus\n\n\nAnother important development in the last decade has been the\nstrengthening of bonds between the alumni and their alma mater\n\n\nEnhanced by the establishment of Alumni Affairs Office in 1988 and\nits programmes of activities\n\n\nThe University has grown very fast and clearly made significant\ngains in the first 10 years as NUS\n\n\nIt is natural at this juncture to pause and ponder how the\nUniversity should develop in the next 10 years\n\n\nThe mission remains one of supporting the nation's social and\neconomic development by producing the needed high-level manpower and by\npromoting research and innovation\n\n\nIt sets the intellectual tone for the society and serves as a rich\nresource of information and expertise for nation building\n\n\nThere is the need to respond to the changing demands as Singapore\nmake its way towards the status of a developed nation\n\n\nUndergraduate course structure and content will continue to be\nreviewed regularly\n\n\nNew subjects and courses will be introduced to meet emerging needs\n\n\nFor example the Science Faculty which has introduced two subjects\nthis year namely Cell and Molecular Biology and Development & Systems Biology\nwill offer Materials Science and Computational Science next year\n\n\nThe Faculty of Arts & Social Sciences will introduce Mass\nCommunication and European Studies next year\n\n\nGreater flexibility will be incorporated in the degree and course\nstructures such that the best and brightest will be able to realise their\nfull potential\n\n\nGrowth will take place mainly in postgraduate enrolment to meet the\nexpected demand for more specialist manpower in the economy\n\n\nNew postgraduate programmes will be introduced when needed\n\n\nEvery effort will be made to increase the enrolment of postgraduate\nresearch students from whom our nation's R & D manpower are derived\n\n\nThe availability of well-trained R & D manpower in sufficient\nnumbers is as we know critical to our further economic growth\n\n\nThe Postgraduate School of Engineering recently established to\nspearhead the expansion of postgraduate programmes in engineering aims to\ndouble the postgraduate research student enrolment to 500 by 1995\n\n\nComparable rates of expansion in the enrolment of research students\nare expected in other disciplines particularly in Science and Medicine\n\n\nThere will be a corresponding increase in research activities on\nthe campus\n\n\nThis will be reflected in the establishment of the Clinical\nResearch Centre the Institute of Microelectronics and the Centre for Advanced\nLegal Studies within the next two years\n\n\nCollaboration with industry will be further intensified especially\nin joint R & D programmes and in the economic exploitation of the fruits of\nresearch\n\n\nInformation technology and biotechnology have been identified as\ntwo important pillars of our economic development\n\n\nThe University will continue to play a key role in these areas\n\n\nThe Bioprocessing Technology Unit recently established in the\nDepartment of Chemical Engineering converts laboratory results in molecular\nbiology into commercial entities\n\n\nThe National Supercomputing Resource Centre soon to be set up by\nthe University combined with the campus-wide state-of-the-art computing\nnetwork which is optical-fibre based and the largest in the Asia Pacific\nregion will provide the optimal environment for R&D in information technology\n\n\nImplicit in the above plans and measures is the objective of making\nNUS a world class university building on the sound foundation already laid\ndown\n\n\nThis will complement Singapore's march towards being a developed\nnation\n\n\nThe existing campus facilities planned and constructed mainly in\nthe 70's will be upgraded and extended so that they are not only functional\n\n\nBut also aesthetically pleasing and bearing a distinctive character\nthat reflects the history and heritage of the University\n\n\nA concert hall theatre of international standard will be built\nincorporating a museum and a visual art centre to provide a Centre for\nPerforming and Fine Art on the campus\n\n\nThis will further enrich the cultural life of the university and\nensure a more rounded education\n\n\nThree additional Halls of residence will also be built to provide\nfor at least one year of on-campus residence for every undergraduate\n\n\nA master planner for this major campus-wide project has been\nappointed and a concept plan is expected to be ready by the end of the year\n\n\nThe physical facilities should ultimately be of a standard\nbefitting a world-class university\n\n\nFor the graduates there is much about your alma mater that you can\nbe proud of and there is more to expect in the offing\n\n\nA proud alumnus is one who feels he has a stake in the future of\nhis alma mater\n\n\nAnd the best universities in the world for example the Ivy League\nuniversities are those which receive strong regular support from their proud\nalumni\n\n\nAs the saying goes 'A university is only as great as its alumni\nwant it to be'\n\n\nNUS is no exception\n\n\nAs it moves up the scale of excellence the need for support from\nits alumni will become increasingly obvious\n\n\nWe have therefore got to start to work on providing this support\n\n\nSetting up an endowment fund as suggested by our Minister Dr Tony\nTan would be a good start\n\n\nThis is being seriously looked into\n\n\nThe Alumni Affairs Office will liaise with you on this matter in\ndue course\n\n\nMeanwhile your ideas and suggestions are most welcome\n\n\nI am confident that the alumni of which you are already a part are\nnow ready to do their utmost for their alma mater\n\n\nTheir loyalty and attachment to the University coupled with their\nsense of gratitude will move them to help make their alma mater even better\nthan what they themselves had known it to be\n\n\nIn conclusion I would like to take this opportunity to wish all of\nyou the very best in the pursuit of your careers ahead of you\n\n\nYou may have left the campus but you are still very much a part of\nthe greater NUS community\n\n\nDo visit the campus and take part in the wide variety of alumni\nactivities if only to remind yourselves that learning should not cease with\ngraduation from the University\n\n\nLearning is a life-long adventure to be courted and relished always\n\n\nTo those who are receiving their first degree scrolls this year the\njob market continues to beckon with many exciting opportunities\n\n\nThe demand for graduates in the economy remains strong and new\ngraduates of the university are known to be keen capable and hardworking\n\n\nThey will have the opportunity to put to good use what they have\nlearnt in the university\n\n\nIt will soon become apparent to the new graduates that except for\ncolleagues from the professional faculties working in professional firms

{"text": "ADDRESS BY MR LIM SOON HOCK, MANAGING DIRECTOR,\nASIA COMPAQ COMPUTER ASIA PTE LTD \n\n<$A> \n\nMr Pro-Chancellor Graduates Ladies and Gentlemen\n\n\nIt is a privilege for me to address you all today\n\n\nCongratulations graduates\n\n\nFor many of you today marks the end of your academic careers and I'm\nsure you have looked forward to this moment with great expectations\n\n\nThe degrees you collect today are recognition of what you have\naccomplished through hard work perseverance and dedication\n\n\nThey will prove to the world that you are all trained engineers\n\n\nThey look backward at the life you have lead until today and praise\nyou for your accomplishments\n\n\nBut they represent something far more important\n\n\nSomething which looks ahead\n\n\nThey prove that you have learned how to learn\n\n\nThat in the final analysis is education's greatest gift\n\n\nBecause in the world outside the comfortable halls of academia it\nis not what you know but rather what you are able to learn which will make\nall the difference\n\n\nWhat lies ahead of you all today is a world which is changing\nfaster and more profoundly than it ever has before\n\n\nIt is a world that just a few short years ago was unimaginable\n\n\nWho could have imagined a united Germany\n\n\nThe fall of communism in country after country in Eastern Europe\n\n\nManned space travel being only page three news or the Soviet Union\nlooking to the United States and other countries for the financing necessary\nto move toward a free market economy\n\n\nSo if the degrees you receive today are tickets for your journey\nthrough this daunting and unpredictable landscape what advice can I lend to\nhelp you on your way\n\n\nI think I would start with a strange request\n\n\nI would ask each and every one of you to be unreasonable\n\n\nThis must sound strange after you have spent so much time in these\nhalls learning the value of reason honing your skills to become reasoned\nthinkers\n\n\nAnd after countless requests from parents and teachers to just be\nreasonable\n\n\nLet me explain\n\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw once said The reasonable man adapts himself to\nthe world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to\nhimself Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man\n\n\nIf Shaw had been writing today he undoubtedly would have said that\nprogress depends on the unreasonable man or woman and that raises another\npoint about changes in the world around us\n\n\nChanging the world is no longer the province of just men\n\n\nWhat was once patronisingly called the fairer sex has proven that\nit is often also the smarter and more capable one\n\n\nThe proverbial battle of the sexes has broken free of the confines\nof moonlit nights and candle-lit dinners\n\n\nNow it is as frequently waged in boardrooms or from political\nplatforms\n\n\nSo why do I ask you men and women to be unreasonable\n\n\nWhat do I mean by being unreasonable\n\n\nIf I place my request in its historical context perhaps it will\nbecome clearer\n\n\nThe 19th century saw the rapid advancement of civilization first\nstart on a modern scale of pace reach and impact\n\n\nIt brought the industrial revolution great strides forward in\nmedicine and the ascendance of science as man's principal tool for unlocking\nthe mysteries of the world around him\n\n\nIt was called the Age of Reason\n\n\nIn the 20th century the world first took full advantage of all of\nthese new found tools of reason\n\n\nThe pace of change took a huge stride forward\n\n\nTwo world wars and the terrifying technology of nuclear weapons\ncreated a bi-polar political structure which has brought relative stability\nto world politics for the past 50 years\n\n\nMan began the exploration of space\n\n\nInformation became instantly accessible around the globe\n\n\nWhen Japan declared war against the United States it took two and a\nhalf days for the declaration to be formally presented\n\n\nI am told that George Bush informed Mikhail Gorbachev of the US\ninvasion of Kuwait within twenty minutes\n\n\nAnd coverage of that war was seen live on televisions in London\nliving rooms and Sarawak longhouses simultaneously\n\n\nWe truly have become the products of the Information Age\n\n\nThis overwhelming abundance of and access to information will have\na major impact in further shaping the century to come\n\n\nIt will be a century which one London Business School professor has\ndubbed The Age of Unreason\n\n\nThis is the century that you inherit the century you will help\nshape\n\n\nWhat will it be like\n\n\nI'm sure my imagination could not do it credit but some parts of it\nare clear\n\n\nTechnology will bring changes at a faster and faster rate\n\n\nTraditional structures and processes of business and society will\nbe replaced over and over again\n\n\nWithin a decade it has been predicted that eighty percent of all\njobs in industrialised nations will call for mental rather than manual skills\n\n\nThat seems extremely encouraging for a group of new degree holders\n\n\nBut what mental skills will be needed\n\n\nHopefully many of those same skills which you have worked so hard\nat learning during your years here at University\n\n\nEducation will have given you the tools you need to confront the\nchange which lies ahead\n\n\nAs graduates you represent the top 18% of all students in Singapore\n\n\nBut your specific training as engineers is only one part of what\nyou will need\n\n\nPrimary among the broader skills your education has given you will\nbe the ability to adapt and learn to master and in fact help shape change\n\n\nThat statement brings me back to my original premise about being\nunreasonable\n\n\nIn this context then being unreasonable means not being content to\naccept change but rather taking the initiative to shape it\n\n\nAs you enter the working world you become a part of the process of\nchange\n\n\nMore importantly the significance of the part you play is entirely\nup to you\n\n\nEinstein had three rules of work\n\n\nOne out of clutter find simplicity\n\n\nTwo from discord make harmony\n\n\nThree in the middle of difficulty lies opportunity\n\n\nThese are simple rules from a very complex man\n\n\nBut it is important to note that these rules place the burden\nsquarely on the shoulders of the individual\n\n\nIt will be your job to find simplicity and make harmony\n\n\nTo rise above difficulty and take advantage of every opportunity\n\n\nYou must find it unreasonable to resist change to do it as it has\nalways been done\n\n\nYou must find it unreasonable to approach challenges with\nconventional thought to play conventional roles to be content with the status\nquo\n\n\nMany of you, statistics show that as many as 20 to 30 per cent of\nyou may find your careers leading you away from your training in engineering\n\n\nOn the other hand many of you will prosper in your chosen field for\nyears to come\n\n\nEither course is fine as long as you refuse to either hide behind\ncomplacency or run from adversity\n\n\nThe changing future has equal need for the strength and discipline\nof focused experts and the creativity and daring of entrepreneurs\n\n\nThe key is to continue to adapt the world around you on whatever\npath you choose\n\n\nIn the past that world has been adapted by two forces more than any\nothers\n\n\nTechnology and economics each feeding on and spurring growth in the\nother\n\n\nThe individuals who have made a difference have always understood\nthis link and exploited it to the fullest\n\n\nMany of them started as engineers\n\n\nIt was reasonable to think that the telegraph transported\ninformation quickly and effectively but not to Alexander Graham Bell\n\n\nIt was reasonable to be content with gas lighting but not to Thomas\nEdison\n\n\nIt was reasonable to think that conventional manufacturing\ntechniques produced adequate amounts of goods but not to Henry Ford\n\n\nThe list is a familiar one\n\n\nIndividuals with vision and an unreasonable desire to reinvent the\nworld around themselves\n\n\nSo how do these well-known examples have relevance in today's\nSingapore\n\n\nEach of these unreasonable men changed their world\n\n\nThey combined technical engineering skills with vision to propel\ntheir societies forward and their ideas helped spur enormous economic growth\nin their countries\n\n\nIf we look at today's leading nations\n\n\nEach built economic might on the back of technological excellence\n\n\nThe United States Germany Japan\n\n\nEngineering and engineers with vision led the way\n\n\nToday's Singapore provides unlimited opportunities for tomorrow's\nEdisons Fords and Bells\n\n\nSingapore has worked hard to provide an environment which is not\nlimited by its small geographic boundaries\n\n\nOur country has succeeded in creating the landscape of a\ntechnopolis with worldwide relevance\n\n\nForesight perseverance and hard work have given Singapore its much\nenvied infrastructure\n\n\nThe hard structures facilities and technologies needed to provide\nfor growth in the 20th century\n\n\nToday's great global companies have recognised Singapore's\nimportance by establishing themselves here\n\n\nYou must match and indeed take advantage of their global vision\n\n\nThe opportunities for each and every one of you to expand both\nyour visionary and physical horizons are better than they have ever been\nbefore\n\n\nIt is not unreasonable to think that any of you could find work in\none of the world's largest corporations\n\n\nIt is not unreasonable to think that the work you do for such a\ncompany can effect and change the world for the better\n\n\nIt is not unreasonable to expect you to build the soft\ninfrastructure by which I mean the creativity innovativeness technical\nexpertise R&D know how financial acumen marketing prowess and managerial\ntalents which will be needed to continually attract investments into\nSingapore as we grow into the 21st century\n\n\nIt may seem unreasonable however for me to make my next request\n\n\nCurrently only four Singapore companies are counted among the\nworlds top 1,000\n\n\nI put it to you that you can play a role in seeing that number\ngreatly increase during your lifetimes\n\n\nSome among you may become entrepreneurs\n\n\nIt will take courage and perseverance to see your personal visions\ngrow and prosper\n\n\nBut you must always remember that growth and prosperity are only\nlimited by your ideas\n\n\nBy successfully combining your technical training with the\nbusiness skills which you will develop and hone in your professional careers\nyou can add to that list\n\n\nWith a global vision and the opportunities which Singapore's\ntechnopolis holds out to you you can become masters of change\n\n\nBut does this mean you must master change alone\n\n\nDoes it mean you must discard everything from the past\n\n\nThankfully it does not\n\n\nTo face change and become its master you will need firm\nfoundations and anchors\n\n\nYour parents the families you yourselves will start your school\nyour cultural traditions and the society around you\n\n\nAll will serve as your reservoirs of strength and continuity in\nthe changing world\n\n\nBut as much as these represent strength and support you will now\nbegin to see the responsibility they bring with them as well\n\n\nThroughout your education you have been able to concentrate on\nyourselves\n\n\nYour test scores your performance and your growing abilities have\nbeen your first priority\n\n\nBut today represents as much as anything the beginning of a shift\nin that scale of priorities\n\n\nNow begins the process of looking outward of giving back to those\npeople institutions and structures which have given so much to you\n\n\nAs you adapt the future never discard the past\n\n\nInstead build on it\n\n\nKeep up your ties with the University\n\n\nI would urge you all to become active members of the Engineering\nAlumni\n\n\nToday you have been transformed from your status as students to\nmembership in a much broader fellowship that of graduates\n\n\nAs members of this fellowship you have new resources on which to\ndraw and new responsibilities to fulfil\n\n\nIf recent statements by our government are anything to go by the\nAlumni will play a greater role in the future development of our University\n\n\nThat role is not merely limited to financial support\n\n\nYou can contribute by sharing your expertise and the new areas of\nspecialisation which you will find in the professional world with the\nundergraduates graduates and fellow alumni\n\n\nThis type of shared fellowship can foster professionalism create\nbusiness opportunities and most importantly help the University to become a\nricher and more lively environment for learning \n\n\nNow you get to change the world It is your job to give shape and\nmeaning to the Age of Unreason Do it with a sense of expectation and\npossibility Do it with enthusiasm Do it for both yourself and others and I am\nconfident you will do it well I think, all in all, that is a pretty\nreasonable request", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

\n\nSo it's got to be fresh so\n\n<$B> \n\nFresh\n\n<$C> \n\nThe one in the photography is going to be\n\n<$B> \n\nit's no for photography is the one provided by Andrew and ya\n\n<$C> \n\nHuh

it\n\n<$D> \n\nBut she's quite good you know\n\n<$B> \n\nBut\n\n<$B> \n\nShe's quite good\n\n<$D> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nYa\n\n<$C> \n\nHow come these people in this business always like <unclear>\nword </unlcear> kind you know\n\n<$B> \n\nYa the more they more creative they are\n\n<$B> \n\nVery creative you see\n\n\nBut generally they they are very creative people\n\n<$B> \n\nSo you're scouting around is it Wilma\n\n<$C> \n\nOh not yet lah\n\n\nI'm just relieved the engagement was over\n\n<$B> \n\nWas it very big uhm thing\n\n<$C> \n\nUh not really lah\n\n\nActually we wanted it to be smaller thing then my mum said must\ncall her sister and all lah\n\n\nso in the end about thirty people only lah\n\n<$B> \n\nThirty uh\n\n<$C> \n\nMm\n\n\nNow we're only worried about the the flat lah\n\n<$B> \n\nOh When did you all live\n\n<$C> \n\nWe are want you know we actually don't know whether to go for\nthe private or the HDB see\n\n\nSo we just keep our option open\n\n\nWe applied for HDB as well as looking around for a good private\nplace\n\n<$B> \n\nWhich HDB did you all apply\n\n<$C> \n\nBishan\n\n<$B> \n\nOh oh very near your place\n\n<$C> \n\nYa but hope can get it's like take novena and pray\n\n<$B> \n\nPoor dog uh he wants to come out\n\n<$B> \n\nHe's always like that\n\n<$D> \n\nSo cute\n\n<$C> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nSo active\n\n<$B> \n\nAh\n\n<$D>

right\n\n<$C> \n\nYa\n\n<$B> \n\nBut then she didn't invite many many people so she baked\nabout four big cakes and four big you know square cakes and\n\n\nand that was sufficient but they had to wrap

sorry <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nWhere's the rest of eighty two\n\n\nDid the rest of you bring the textbook\n\n\nOkay right get <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nSit\n\n\nLet's start\n\n\nOkay before we begin that's Brenda Lee\n\n\nShe's here from the university and she's just taping us\n\n\nPlease don't go multiple sicion and shut up\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nWe do need to get on with this\n\n\nAlright fine\n\n\nWhat\n\n\nAh yes well never mind\n\n\nIt's it's a bit of unavoided since that's already there okay\n\n\nRight we're going to go through Much Ado and last week we started\ntalking about <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nYes\n\n\nYes we did <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nWe did talk about\n\n\nDid we go through it in detail\n\n\nNo\n\n\nAlright\n\n\nLet's start with that because you need to be absolutely sure how this\ntext works\n\n\nNow please be highly conscious that this is identical to Lear in\nterms of perceptions\n\n\nYou are going to always one of the principles that there is no one\nview about love that's presented by Shakespeare\n\n\nBut you're rather going to have ah multiple views presented by the\nmultiple sets of characters\n\n\nNow we've identified this now\n\n\nWho are the sets of characters who are directly in the issue of love\n\n\nOkay Beatrice and Benedict\n\n\nOkay Claudio and Hero and Margaret\n\n\nThe announcer <unclear> word </unclear> hero\n\n\nYa\n\n\nOkay why are you late\n\n\nAlright quick\n\n\nOkay recap right\n\n\nWe're talking about the aspect of love\n\n\nI don't like people sitting behind me\n\n\nI can't see them\n\n\nOkay right\n\n\nOkay let's get on to this okay\n\n\nNow the question of time <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nIs this that you need figure out\n\n\nWhat are the kinds of views about love represented in the sets\n\n\nThe starting point has always got to be the kind of character love\n\n\nLet's try and pick one particular group\n\n\nOkay can we start with Hero and Claudio\n\n\nAnd remember what we said\n\n\nIt's always easy if you have the same like love is something or love\nis shown to be something like in Lear\n\n\nOkay we saw that love can be ungrateful\n\n\nOkay or we came to understand that people's love cannot be quantified\nbecause of the behaviour of Lear okay where he attempts to drive Cordelia\n\n\nTo quantify it you find that it doesn't work\n\n\nLove does not always have to be forgiving\n\n\nIt can be merciless as well\n\n\nRight now do you see <unclear> word </unclear> of love in Much Ado\n\n\nWhat are the angles\n\n\nLet's start with Hero and Claudio\n\n\nOkay that love can be superficial\n\n\nAlright <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nCan somebody pick it up please\n\n\nWhat do we mean by love can be superficial\n\n\nMean what\n\n\nUh huh Okay\n\n\nRight\n\n\nOkay so that love can be at the top level <unclear> word </unclear>\nwhere there is the use of sight okay\n\n\nYou see and you respond you may not go beyond that Yes that love can\nbe based on ignorance as well\n\n\nRight\n\n\nThat's an idea that comes across that there is potential where love\ncan be based on ignorance\n\n\nIgnorant\n\n\nOkay so that will be the example to prove that\n\n\nWhat else is it\n\n\nWhat else\n\n\nDo we get caught\n\n\nThis this object topic of love by Shakespeare's presentation\n\n\nYou say love is naive okay\n\n\nAre you using Hero and Claudio specifically\n\n\nCan you give specific examples\n\n\nYes specific example we're sorting in the text that specifically show\nthemselves to be naive about the concept of love <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nAnd so\n\n\nAnd what now\n\n\nAbout the love for them\n\n\nRight\n\n\nCan we all agree with that\n\n\nAnybody have difficulties with that\n\n\nLeonard what time is it\n\n\nWhere were you\n\n\nDidn't you get the message\n\n\nAlright come on in\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nRight\n\n\nSo you have decided there is naive <unclear> word </unclear> love\n<unclear> word </unclear> because of the fact we don't like Judge <unclear>\nword </unclear> and unlike of what's going on rather you look around and you\nuse information from secondary sources\n\n\nIs love fickle\n\n\nIs that the same as love being naive\n\n\nProve that love is okay but do you think that <unclear> word\n</unclear> that in the relationship between Hero and Claudio you see that\nlove is fickle\n\n\nUh huh but what does he change\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\nSo\n\n\nWhat does love become\n\n\nRight\n\n\nThat's a better way of putting it\n\n\nIn this case one sees the double relationship between love and trust\n\n\nOkay how is this relation what should be the ideal state\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nAlright let's just <unclear> word </unclear> we've got two lines\nabout this\n\n\nOne is that hero does sorry Hero does the dying bit and Claudio\nregisters no emotion so the argument here here is love is fickle or frivolous\nbecause it is swayed\n\n\nAre you using a different point Audrey\n\n\nOkay now Audrey's point is that he only goes to Hero when he wants\nsomething and when he doesn't want it or it seems that he's not getting the\nwhole quality of what he should be getting he drops it\n\n\nHe picks it up again with\n\n\nIt's quite clear she's innocent so there's a frivolity to his\nattitude towards love\n\n\nIt's not treated as a stable thing\n\n\nIt's more an imbalance thing where he moves from pole to pole\n\n\nIs that the same being fickle\n\n\nAlright what is that\n\n\nCan we try a better word for fickle or frivolous for this thing that\nwhere you say I will love you if you love me back equal proportionately\n\n\nSelfish\n\n\nConditional\n\n\nWhat else\n\n\nLove meets your expectations\n\n\nYes a very\n\n\nWhat\n\n\nMerit\n\n\nLove has no merit\n\n\nOkay where you set a value and if that value is not responded to\nwhat do\n\n\nWe don't want to <unclear> word </unclear> so it's condition\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nBut ya I'm willing to accept the argument <unclear> word </unclear>\nthat maybe the love here is fickle fickle\n\n\nI'm going to accept that argument and the counter-ar argument going\non as well that you know maybe it is because he's so hurt he does these\nthings to Hero so therefore his love is true\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nPoint he's <unclear> word </unclear> being miserable when she is\ndead\n\n\nOkay now you're all not going to resolve this one\n\n\nSo some of you have resolved versus <unclear> word </unclear> two\npolar views about how you're going to look at Claudio\n\n\nOne of you obviously is not a Claudio fan quite clear okay but\n<unclear> word </unclear> so he's okay\n\n\nPlease let's not go into those kind of analysis but yes there are\nmultiple responses\n\n\nIt's exactly like the Lear\n\n\nGet used to it\n\n\nThe comedy you may think you hate it but <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nAlright let's go on\n\n\nWhat other aspects of love can you see\n\n\nWith Hero and Claudio at work\n\n\nTry and think about the way they enter this love relationship\n\n\nConventional ya\n\n\nIt's a display of conventionality that surrounds love and marriage\nokay\n\n\nOkay can we please explain the conventionality go on to the\n<unclear> word </unclear> idea\n\n\nYa one Claudio woos her by proxy\n\n\nWhat is already wrong if you woo by proxy\n\n\nYes you aren't understanding somebody else\n\n\nWhat does that mean about your own understanding if you send\nsomebody else\n\n\nYou don't actually understand the person or uh you can't use the\nword insulting\n\n\nWhy would it not be correct to use the fact that it'll be insulting\nto the other person if you woo by proxy\n\n\nRight this is the convention at that time that argument is <unclear>\nword </unclear>\n\n\nIt's the convention of the period that you could do this but given\nthat what does it do to your love relation\n\n\nYa\n\n\nYou yourself lack knowledge alright\n\n\nAnd please remember the issue of knowledge and love <unclear> word\n</unclear>\n\n\nKnowledge what\n\n\nYou tell me\n\n\nWho\n\n\nWho said what\n\n\nLeonard where where are you\n\n\nLeonard if you hide behind the chair\n\n\nOkay what knowledge of what\n\n\nEach other\n\n\nYa okay\n\n\nSo you've got that element to consider as well\n\n\nRight\n\n\nElaine had the idea that love here is seen to be rash\n\n\nWhy rash\n\n\nRight there is the <unclear> word </unclear> of her naive\n\n\nIsn't the way naive is\n\n\nOkay fine you got to <unclear> word </unclear> to that\n\n\nWho wants this\n\n\nEverybody you got the argument it's rash and you also have the\nargument that it is a sign of real love because didn't <unclear> word\n</unclear> say love him marry him\n\n<$> Convention dictates that you shall all the laws lay down their father\n\n So Hero displays that conventional kind of behaviour\n\n Yet can we ask the question what is the clear proof that their\nlove is rash\n\n What would you use\n\n What evidence in the text indicates\n\n One week\n\n Good\n\n That's right\n\n Please try and remember it's a comedy because actions get pushed\ntogether\n\n There's a willingness on the part of the audience to suspend\nincredulity\n\n you willingly allow time to pass\n\n You must never forget that the theatre works by that method that\nyou have a squashed perception\n\n There's such a thing as stage time against real time\n\n In stage time there's credibility to the action\n\n In real time you stop to think about it it's one week\n\n Just like Lear gets in to his kingdom divides it gets shut up by\none daughter moves on to another and to another\n\n Within a month\n\n you're being tremendously generous there\n\n How many days you think\n\n Ya two three days\n\n You're talking about a squashed action and his whole rise and fall\n\n word\n</unclear> count it the whole rise and fall can't take more than a week and a\nhalf\n\n a marriage\n\n We're talking about a marriage between two individuals who never\nsee each other who know nothing about each other except the superficiality\nand half the time that they spend together before the marriage what kind of\nstate are they\n\n They're never alone\n\n What else\n\n They're masked\n\n big ball\n\n They're masked\n\n They never see each other\n\n It's almost as if it were a metaphor the way they are themselves\nthey never have knowledge\n\n They all wear a kind of mask\n\n Yes uhm Yes yes there is an idealization\n\n as well\n\n word\n</unclear> <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n He sees her as a heroic figure\n\n of\na kind of romantic ideal at work\n\n With this idea of convention love you have a romantization of\nobject of myself which is what Claudio has been guilty of\n\n Okay everybody is still here and awake\n\n We're not dying yet are we\n\n Okay fine\n\n Okay do you get an idea what we're doing with this text\n\n It's the same thing with the Lear only we're going at a different\nlevel <unclear> word </unclear> very deeply\n\n Two themes\n\n One is love other will be appearance versus reality\n\n Okay can we drop Hero and Claudio for a moment\n\n Can we look at Beatrice and Benedick\n\n almost too dry\n\n Alright what about Beatrice and Benedick\n\n What comes to mind automatically if we're asked to justify the\npresentation of love by those two characters\n\n Love through understanding\n\n eyebrow that seems to indicate\nthat <unclear> word </unclear> argument\n\n Okay who's going to support love through understanding\n\n\n\n What what are they\n\n Between the two of them what are they\n\n Ya that's right\n\n uh huh\n\n You you have to find Shakespeare\n\n Can't tell you that\n\n What do you think\n\n Okay the argument here is do they un do they fall in love because\nof understanding or is understanding something that arises later on\n\n It's there so you think they fall in love with understanding uh\nhuh\n\n So there's you mean there's no choice but to understand uh huh\n\n Right so what do you say his love is based on\n\n anguish language\n\n Why\n\n It's a very interesting idea\n\n Right you got it\n\n So you\n\n Can I modify your statement\n\n You said based on language language is based on communication\nbecause they use a tool they are she's got she's got the half of the problem\nthere that that they are the two who talk \n\n Even if they fight at least they are talking It's not a case\nwhere Hero wants nothing but to say 'I shall <unclear> word </unclear> ' and\nClaudio does nothing but listen very well to everybody else and not talk to\nHero Right so there's always the use of the proxy Now your idea of proxy\ncomes <unclear> word </unclear> By using proxy to communicate in the affairs\nof love there it becomes insulting for an audience to believe Okay So you've\ngot to try and draw the line where is conventionality acceptable where isn't\nit And how can the lack of communication mar a relationship especially in the\nissue of love Okay go on Okay so what are you then saying Okay right well\nit's as you can see right on this small subject we're already having multiple\nviews about these characters We're going to try and reconcile these yes we're\ngoing and get a part of the problem here Are we then saying that they are so\nsimilar that they fail to see each other because they can't Or are we saying\nthat they are so similar they must see each other What then is your stand for\nthe two of them They're too proud right The issue of pride <unclear> word\n</unclear> Alongside communication somebody brought up the idea of scornful\nlove okay This is where you're going to talk about pride impeding in love\nAlright even though they have knowledge of each other what do they fail to\nhave knowledge of Other <unclear> word </unclear> they have knowledge of each\nother what do they fail in Themselves Right that's where you get it Pride\nimpedes", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "95167cb2-2b1a-462e-bf60-803401fb737d", "added":

{"text": "26 March 1992 How Progress helps you to downsize \n\n\n\nUh so come to uh this session\n\n\n\nUh I'm Joseph Liew\n\n\n\nI'm from Base Management System\n\n\n\nWe are the distributor for Progress in Singapore\n\n\n\nUh graph sizing computing application from mainframe and\nmicrocomputers to PC LAN is one of the hottest trend in uh corporate\ncomputing today\n\n\n\nOkay MIS challenged by uh increasing cost pressure uh accelerating\nbusiness changes and competition\n\n\n\nUh we are also faced with technological change and complexity uh also\nshifting management structure\n\n\n\nAll these business uh pressures have actually forced MIS to rely on\neither out outside what you call Outsourcing or Downsizing\n\n\n\nAnd according to the recent survey sixty to seventy percent of\nFortune thousand companies are in the actively in downsizing project or plan\nto get started within the next twelve months\n\n\n\nMany companies are searching for low cost computing options and a\ndesire to improve the flexibility of computing application\n\n\n\nInstead of running all uhm corporate application on mainframe or\nmicro MIS director now find that uhm there are many application that can run\nperfectly well on small computer connected in a network environment\n\n\n\nA well-constructed uh network can house plenty of computing power\ntoday\n\n\n\nUh the components of all these uh network configuration uh people are\nusing things like personal computers workstation pass server database server\n\n\n\nAnd it can be if you can uh appropriate size and then uh plug in or\nplug up uhm the environment you can make your application uh run very uh\nsuccessfully according to the needs uhm it takes\n\n\n\nOkay you can plug in or out from the environment\n\n\n\nMoving uh application to smaller computer if you have done it\ncorrectly you can achieve the following:\n\n\n\nOne substantially uh lower the operation cost while improving\nflexibility\n\n\n\nSecond enjoy the same computing power and benefit of a mainframe or\nmicrocomputer at only a fraction of cost\n\n\n\nYou can also realize greater flexibility when it comes to development\nsupport and ongoing maintenance\n\n\n\nYou have at your disposal more flexible tool for development and\nsupport and also more scaleable platform for ongoing maintenance\n\n\n\nMove away you can also move away from uh this what call <unclear>\nword </unclear> computing boxes towards more open or at least uh reusable\nhardware\n\n\n\nIn some cases the server of today uh can be downsized to the\nworkstation end-user workstation of tomorrow\n\n\n\nAnother key to im uh improving flexibility of system is the movement\naway from the third generation development languages like COBOL or C\n\n\n\nOkay so uh you are I I believe uh all of you come to this show uh you\nhave more or less decided to adopt downsizing as a company strategy to\nimprove your practical advantages and better leverage your information\ninvestment\n\n\n\nNow the challenge is uh you is on you as to how you should take\napplication that were mainframe or microcomputer and uh orientated uh and\nbring it down to a uh low-end uh PC LAN environment\n\n\n\nDownsizing doesn't uh equate to a reducing software development time\nand cost uh at least not automatically\n\n\n\nUh creating software for a downsized system can entail significantly\nhigher cost than for a mainframe environment especially if it's done with a\nthird generation language traditionally used to develop large mainframe\nsoftware like COBOL or C\n\n\n\nBecause such languages assume that an application will run on a\nsingle computer\n\n\n\nThey do not directly support distribution or processing and data over\nher heterogeneous network of geographically dispersed computers\n\n\n\nThe principal requirement for most application running in a downsized\nenvironment\n\n\n\nConsequently using a third generation language to downsize\napplication entail designing and coding support for network computing into\nthe application software itself which is a also a major ah undertaking\n\n\n\nSo IS manager under pressure to downsize need a more powerful breed\nof uh application development tool\n\n\n\nYou need an effective downsizing environment that meets the combined\nrequirements of integrity and reliability security and straightforward setup\nand maintenance\n\n\n\nYou need support from two for planning and design\n\n\n\nThat's why uhm we are trying to uh introduce you Progress how\nProgress can actually help you to solve the increasing business pressure in\nterms of lower the cost adapting to change business change and uh supporting\nmachine uh of management structures\n\n\n\nOkay let me bring you uh to Progress uh product itself\n\n\n\nProgress actually offer the complete uh application development\nsystem\n\n\n\nProgress has got its own fourth  GL with SQL we also have a fast\ntrack what you call is a application user can actually paint screen uhm\ncreate menu and adhoc reports using this uh fast track\n\n\n\nProgress also had its own data dictionary and its own relational\ndatabase\n\n\n\nThis uh Progress fourth  GL actually is a very elegant procedural\nand now you can create procedural and non-procedural statements uh if you are\nuh using the default or the uh Progress command uh you can actually uh cut\nshort a lot of development time uh\n\n\n\nInside this uh there is a enter where it will do the normal syntax\nchecking for you uh while you are phototyping your application\n\n\n\nYou also have a on-line help facility within the enter\n\n\n\nYou can do what are like key-stroke level programming control\n\n\n\nUh Progress also support old uh SQL and you are writing any uh things\nto communicate with your hardware uh <unclear> word </unclear> peripheral if\nyou require to use C to do the communication or whatever\n\n\n\nProgress do support uh C interface for this special purpose\n\n\n\nProgress actually give you a high level support for many tasks common\nto transaction processing and information access such as database\nmanipulation and screen and report processing enables creation of downsized\napplication in a fraction of a time required inverted G\n\n\n\nIf you are a this uh fast track is actually a menu-driven application\nuser which is very ideal for uh rapid phototyping you can paste screens\ndesign menu and reports\n\n\n\nIt can also perform uh ad-hoc database query and the fast track\nitself is actually written uh on Progress\n\n\n\nSo uh whatever things you you are making use to do it will generate\nthe reusable fourth  GL code for you\n\n\n\nSo you can actually make use of this fourth  GL code and uh bring\nit in and cut and paste into your application procedure and you can save this\nuh course in the library and as and when you can uh bring this out to uh cut\nand paste or do some modification to suit your application requirement\n\n\n\nProgress also support development of uh application distributed\nacross heterogeneous computer networks\n\n\n\nUh it automatically handle uh the distributed processing such as uh\ncommunication re re remote processes and accessing the ah store in uh other\ncomputer and Progress actually support hundreds of uh hard hardware\n\n\n\nUh we also support the operating system like DOS OS/2 uh in respaced\nkind of system running Unix or OS/2\n\n\n\nYou have also uhm workstation running Unix or BMS\n\n\n\nAll those uh application that is developed using Progress fourth <&>  4)\nGL you can actually port it over to any of these supported platform without\nhaving to change any the user interface and so on\n\n\n\nUh actually are identical across all the

got its own interactive data dictionary which allow you\nto uh control things like file and field validation\n\n\n\nThis is very good for you to uh make use to uh checking input\nvalidation

have any uh transaction\nover the other databases uh Progress will disconnect it for you so that you\nwill enhance the power and other things like uh it will host the <unclear>\nword </unclear> import and also the export facility within this uh data\ndictionary\n\n\n\nProgress has a uh its own relational database\n\n\n\nThis actually eliminates the need to acquire or develop sep separate\nRDDMS

GL signif signifying the uh simplify the\ndevelopment of dispersed application possible by implementing a client server\ndistributed computer model utilizing built-in protocol for co-ordination\n\n\n\nA client server model actually divide an application into two types\nof uh co-operating tasks: one those specific to the application and those\ncommon to a group of application\n\n\n\nA server perform the common task at the request of a client task and\na client server model actually has uh several advantages:\n\n\n\none it allow client to be developed uh independently of servers and\nreduce development time by eliminating\n\n\n\nOne needs to write codes for those tasks handled by the server second\nclient server model also support distributed processing by dividing an\napplication into segments that can run on different processor or computers as\nlong as communication can be established between them\n\n\n\nA server for a database used by multiple application can run on a\ntime-shared central computer with a client running on workstation connected\nto time-shared system via a local area network\n\n\n\nSuch as uh such a configuration preserve the central control\nadvantages of mainframe environment while offering uh loading application\nspecific processing onto low-cost workstations\n\n\n\nThese are all the uh operating systems

{"text": "Rashid has uh until recently won five important titles including the\nsixth Star Malaysia open twice beating ah coincidence well beating team mate\nFoo Kok Keong in both finals\n\n\nAnd he's strongly tipped to win this title tonight to make it with\nrepeat of luck\n\n\nUh <unclear> word </unclear> over Foo Kok Keong with three games four\nfifteen fifteen eleven fifteen five and uh Kok Keong narrowing things seven\nten\n\n\nAgain Kok Keong part of the wrong foot unfortunately which I think had\nbeen pushed within too far on the far side uh to uh Kok Keong's left and he\nwatched it as it he fell fell out of play and the he wins another point\n\n\nIt's now two points uh he's two points behind at eight ten\n\n\nWell Rashid with one more of his cross court chops and uh Foo Kok\nKeong scrambles for that one fell in the process uh and causing the his side\nof court to to be wet with his perspiration\n\n\nGot it wiped and uh well he's a bit cross his court to Rashid Shidek\nten eight\n\n\nA fine rally between these players and uh it is a very aggressive\nRashid Shidek against the very game Foo Kok Keong\n\n\nRashid using a lot of smashes and in many cases the leaping smash\nwhich is uh usually associated with the the players from Indonesia and China\n\n\nWell Rashid is uh moving into very good effect but uh Foo Kok Keong\nis returning almost everything that comes at him another one of those cross\ncourt chop by Rashid this time it's a cross court chop by uh Foo Kok Keong\nbut uh a little too deep and it falls out of play and uh Rashid moves on one\npoint more\n\n\nEleven eight Rashid is the top seed in this tournament of Malaysia\n\n\nThe number two seed Bangbang Supiato knocked out by Foo Kok Keong in\nthe quarter-final\n\n\nPonpamadi of Indonesia the third seed knocked out by Foo Kok Keong in\nthe semi final\n\n\nAh that's that's good defending and that ends centre court returns\nand Rashid he's fairly quick off the mark and he slams it down very hard and\nthe he moves on to twelve twelve eight\n\n\nYuko Suprianto another Indonesian support seat who was ousted by\nRashid Sidek in the semi-finals\n\n\nUh Foo Kok Keong is the fifth to eighth seeds and then comes\n<unclear> word </unclear> of Thailand Kim Han Kue of Korean Ang Jay Chiang of\nKorea\n\n\nSo now it's the first seat against the fifth to eighth seed in the\nfinal of this nineteen ninety-two Seiko Asian Championship\n\n\nWell Rashid returns the favour has that ball floating quarter court\nand uh Kok Keong is under that one and he picked his spot and sent it down\nvery firmly to win service\n\n\nEight twelve another beating smash from Rashid's and taken by Kok\nKeong scrambling taking it\n\n\nThat's the kind of player he is and his time is over unfortunately\nfor the stroke's that he's returned is the most difficult one this was a\nbreeze but he finally sent it into the net and the well the service crosses\ncourt now again and it's Rashid Sidek with service\n\n\nTwelve points to eight three points away from this first game in the\nMen's Singles Final\n\n\nOne more point for Rashid which makes it easier or does it\n\n\nHe's two points away from this first game and uh he's probably\nwondering where that little extra comes from Foo Kok Keong\n\n\nHe's very quick his strive has gone beyond the reach of Foo Kok Keong\n\n\nRashid Sidek and now he's got one more point before he wins wraps up\nthis first game at fourteen eight now serving to Foo Kok Keong\n\n\nIt's time the cross court keeping smash from Rashid to Kok Keong's\nright falls out of play and service is in the hands of Foo Kok Keong Eight\nfourteen\n\n\nRashid fumbled the return and Kok Keong collects one more point\n\n\nIt's nine fourteen and the you've probably be hear grunting\nreminiscent of the Monica Phyllis in ten tennis or the Jimmy Connors\n\n\nFoo Kok Keong doing the grunting there every shot he attempts Just\n<unclear> word </unclear> service to Rashid Sidek fourteen nine\n\n\nWill Rashid wrap up this first game\n\n\nFourteen nine\n\n\nHe does wrap it up\n\n\nRashid didn't realise but uh it probably falls out of court and so he\nwins his first game at fifteen nine\n\n\nRasid Shidek winning the first game fifteen nine against Foo Kok\nKeong in this Men's Singles Final of the Seiko Asian Badminton Championship\nand uh well you can expect a lot more good badminton from these two players\ncomes the second game in just a moment\n\n\nBoth sides of the court being mopped down because you can just\nimagine the perspiration from these two players\n\n\nThe pace that they're playing at and uh looking at the two of them I\nwould say that uh Rashid is definitely the fitter of the two\n\n\nNow what's going to happen in the second game\n\n\nNow let's watch it Love all Rashid Sidek serving to Foo Kok Keong\n\n\nRashid is very quick on the return and uh here again he demonstrates\nthat uh agility of his he returns that one very quickly and uh he beats Kok\nKeong and wins his first point in the second game\n\n\nOne love Rashid\n\n\nA loud call from the linesman calling the ball out\n\n\nTwo love Rashid leading Foo Kok Keong in the second game\n\n\nThat was much too hard\n\n\nThe fast court net return by Foo Kok Keong falls out of court towards\nthe umpire\n\n\nHenry Ee of Singapore and uh Rashid collects another point three love\n\n\nWith that grunt according <unclear> word </unclear> smash by Foo Kok\nKeong wins him service love three\n\n\nAmazing how Foo Kok Keong scrambles for the shot goes on all force\nand is eager to get up again to retrieve the next shot\n\n\nAnd here the rally in progress after that uh one attempt where he\ngoes sprawling but getting to the shuttle and he wins his point here in after\nthis long rally\n\n\nOne three Foo Kok Keong trading Rashid Sidek\n\n\nThis time this time he's beaten\n\n\nSimilar situation he goes on all force again but doesn't reach the\nshuttle\n\n\nThat chop again the deadly chop from Rashid Sidek beating him to Kok\nKeong's right and the service is over now to Rashid Sidek\n\n\nThree one Rashid on your cam on your screen now\n\n\nShuttle test both players happy with it and service now from Rashid\nthree one\n\n\nThis is one of those shots that uh quite often work for Foo Kok Keong\nthe back end drop shot but uh in this instance it didn't quite work and the\nRashid moves along four one\n\n\nFive one and the umpire was there right at that spot to see the\nshuttle fall out of play the return from Foo Kok Keong\n\n\nFive one\n\n\nVery well executed overhead uh drop shot by Foo Kok Keong and uh\nfollowing the return by Rashid uh cross court net return attempt by Kok Keong\ndoesn't make it and uh Rashid moves on to six\n\n\nSix one\n\n\nFoo Kok Keong winning this duel at the net and uh winning service\nover at one six\n\n\nHe has to do something if he is going to make a fight of it in this\nsecond game\n\n\nHe's five points behind here again another of his drop shot <unclear>\nword </unclear> love\n\n\nLove by the two players\n\n\nLove again two players loving\n\n\nThis is taking everything out of them Stop shot by Rashid\n\n\nAgain love Kok Keong up court shot but out of place and Kok Keong\nwins one more point six two two to Kok Keong and six to Rashid Sidek\n\n\nThe topping would be the strokes that would take everything out of\nthe two players\n\n\nAgain Rashid making use of his height and that deadly uh cross court\ndrop of his cross court chop uh to win that service and he's leading six two\n\n\nAgain we see Kok Keong stretching right down to retrieve the shuttle\n\n\nHe gets it across and uh Rashid makes the mistake of sending the\nshuttle out of lane and uh Kok Keong gets back service at two six\n\n\nAnd uh it's almost ten thirty-five in Kuala Lumpur as we witness the\nMen's Singles Finals between the two Malaysians Rashid Sidek and Foo Kok\nKeong\n\n\nKok Keong collecting another point narrowing down to three points\nthree six\n\n\nAn overhead cross court return by Kok Keong falls out of court and uh\nhe concedes service to Rashid Sidek six three\n\n\nAnother long bogging rally rally between the two players and uh Kok\nKeong attempted and he falls into and he sends the ball into the net and uh\nRashid moves along to seven\n\n\nSeven Rashid three Kok Keong\n\n\nRashid was ready for those returns from Kok Keong and the he was at\nuh punish them and uh he sent the shot shuttle away from uh Kok Keong's reach\nand he moves on to nine\n\n\nNine three nine three\n\n\nAnother shuttle change while Kok Keong request that he be allowed to\ntie his shoe laces\n\n\nNine three Rashid leading and uh we have to look at the way things\nwent uh in last year's final this went to three but uh from the way things\nare going at this point uhm doesn't seem likely to be that way but uh\nanything can happen\n\n\nJust as uh Kok Keong is just proven he is one service over at three\nnine\n\n\nHe's six points behind and uh it's really tough to get six points\nbecause at this stage he's looking a very very tired man and the Rashid still\nplaying very aggressively\n\n\nVery very deep net shot returned by Rashid Shidek\n\n\nHit the net court lightly and fell very deep for Kok Keong and Kok\nKeong had nothing else to do but uh watch it beat him all the way\n\n\nAgain I think attempting to return that shot from uh Rashid Shidek\nthat trope shot from Rashid Shidek\n\n\nHe keeps his racket to the shuttle gets gets it there but uh shuttle\nthat didn't quite make it over the net and uh service is back with Rashid at\nten three or rather he Rashid wins the point ten three\n\n\nHe just move his service three ten seven points for Kok Keong to make\nup ground lost ground\n\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> returned to Kok Keong\n\n\nRashid smashes it\n\n\nKok Keong gets to it and sends it out of court and uh Rashid gains\nback service at ten three\n\n\nTen three Rashid Sidek leading Foo Kok Keong\n\n\nExellent play from the two players and unfortunately Kok Keong had to\nsend it back and return out of court giving away another point to Rashid\neleven three\n\n\nI think it will be quite correct to say that uh Rashid sets his\nvictory he's eleven point and Kok Keong three\n\n\nThat's eight point ahead\n\n\nKok Keong he hit walks after the shuttle and watches it fall and it\nfalls in court\n\n\nIt's now twelve three three points away from victory and another\nmistake by Kok Keong pushing the shuttle a little too hard\n\n\nOut of court and one more point for Rashid Sidek\n\n\nThirteen three\n\n\nHe's two points away from the title\n\n\nThe Asian Badminton Championship crown\n\n\nOne more mistake from Foo Kok Keong and uh Rashid's almost there\n\n\nHe's almost there\n\n\nFourteen three\n\n\nA very weary Foo Kok Keong technically if he puts up a fight as he\nattempts fight back\n\n\nI'm always a long way off but uh he's known to put everything into\nhis match and who knows\n\n\nThat's it\n\n\nFoo Kok Keong he's up on this and Rashid comes away with a defeating\nuh victory defeating that victory he he had over Foo Kok Keong in nineteen\nninety-one\n\n\nFifteen nine\n\n\nFifteen three\n\n\nRashid Sidek beating Foo Kok Keong of Malaysia the victor\n\n\nFoo Kok Keong the vanquished and the score fifteen nine fifteen\nthree \n\n\nWell there's only one more match remaining on tonight's card and\nthis will be the Double Final between the Chinese player of Chen Yu Min and\nWang Zhang Zong against the Malaysian pair Rashid Sidek and Jalan Sidek", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d5aa14ce-929a-4f38-9fce-5ec56d70ddee", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:57.763234+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\n\nOkay it's past ten now and I don't think there're any other people\ncoming\n\n\nIf they can and if they do come well they just come in right\n\n\nUhm my name is Dahlia\n\n\nI'm a reference librarian and uh this tutorial is actually to acquaint\nall of you with Linc and the resources in the library especially our new toy\nthe CD-Rom\n\n\nAnd before I start how many of you have problems using Linc\n\n\nWhat kind of problems do you encounter\n\n\nDo you feel comfortable with it\n\n\nCan you find everything that you want from Linc \n\n\nstudent: What do you mean that we have the book but it's not in Linc\n\n\n\nOkay our system just started running for about about two years or so\n\n\nSo we're still encountering a lot of <unclear> word </unclear>\nproblems\n\n\nuhm all materials from 1980 onward should be in Linc\n\n\nPrior to that they will be in micro on microfiche and in our old\ndatabase so we have not fully integrated everything right now\n\n\nHave you used National library's uhm OPEC system\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's almost the same 'cause it's the first version\n\n\nThis is the enhanced version\n\n\nAnd if we use National Library's uhm OPEC system you can place\nreservations\n\n\nYou can check your borrow and records\n\n\nYou can find out whether that particular book is on loan or not\n\n\nAt the moment Linc does not cannot do that because it is not fully\nintegrated\n\n\nAll the other parts will take time and uh because of that they don't\nseek your co-operation right\n\n\nI think most of the time the problems that you have is not knowing\nwhich particular menu to choose from\n\n\nWhich particular item on the menu to choose from\n\n\nWhether to use Title Personal Authors Keywords right\n\n\nAnd when you check a journal article you check you tend to look at\nthe journal title instead of the journal the title of the journal instead of\nthe articles right\n\n\nI have a feeling that you look at let's say okay Dr Leo Suryadinata\nwrote something on Overseas Chinese in Asian Survey\n\n\nInstead of looking at Asian Survey all of you start keying in\nOverseas Chinese right\n\n\nSome of you do\n\n\nI mean I I I I mean a lot of students come up to me and have have\nthat kind of problems okay\n\n\nBasically Linc is made up of all titles\n\n\nWe have titles of books titles of journals in Linc\n\n\nOkay the I-copies which are individual chapters from various journals\nthey're not in\n\n\nIf you want to find out a particular article on let's say Chinese\nforeign policy Indonesian foreign policy anything like that from journals you\nhave to look up Abstracts and Indexes\n\n\nWe have that in the reference section but I doubt if many people use\nit\n\n\nOkay that's a very useful source of information because a lot of uh\nmaterials on political science are written in journals\n\n\nThey're faster\n\n\nIf you write a book you have to wait what at least a year before\nbefore it's published but journal articles you know it comes up very\nregularly\n\n\nYou don't have to wait through three hundred pages or eight hundred\npages of it\n\n\nYou know usually it's about twenty pages or less\n\n\nEverything is there\n\n\nSo I'm going to demonstrate Linc problems that I think students face\nwell\n\n\nThose are the problems that they bring to the librarians at the\ninformation desk\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nOkay titles\n\n\nWhen you use Titles you must make sure that you use the exact title\nof the book or the journal\n\n\nYou can use let's say bits and pieces of it\n\n\nYou know you can leave out 'and' 'the' all these articles but if you\nwant to retrieve very fast you use the exact title 'Writing Asian Survey' or\nmaybe the title of the book is 'The rise and fall of Mao Tse Tong' write the\nwhole thing\n\n\nThen you can get it immediately\n\n\nBut if you were to type in you know only a few words the main words\nin that title then you have to go through the Keyword search\n\n\nSome people when they get that Keyword search you know oh there is no\nexact match they just give up and leave\n\n\nNo you should not leave\n\n\nYou should go through the Keyword search\n\n\nCombine the all the words then come up with that Title Personal\nauthors do your you use uhm surnames first in most of the names but for Malay\nnames you use as it is\n\n\nDon't use the last name first\n\n\nOrganisations and Conferences\n\n\nOrganisations if you want to look up anything on the Ministry of\nForeign Affairs Monetary Authority of Singapore you use that one especially\nMonetary Authority of Singapore Monthly\n\n\nStatistics\n\n\nWe have the yearbook of Stats at the info desk but the monthly\nquarterly there're all in the uhn Serials Department or the Current\nPeriodicals Department as everybody calls it\n\n\nConference Names well there are so many conferences all over the\nplace\n\n\nIt's very very useful es especially for the engineering students\nbecause they depend a great deal on conferences and uhm symposiums\n\n\nSubject headings\n\n\nAh ha that's the problem\n\n\nI think that's the major problem\n\n\nEverybody else\n\n\nSubject headings are not you know Transportation that's it no tran\n\n\nWhen you use Subject Headings you must use this Library of Congress\nSubject Headings\n\n\nWe use this so that you can retrieve as much information on a\nparticular subject\n\n\nFor example you want something on MRT\n\n\nSingapore calls it MRT\n\n\nLondon it's called the tube or the underground\n\n\nIn New York it's called the underground\n\n\nYou see all\n\n\nIn Hong Kong it's all is called the NTRC or something like that\n\n\nSo all the different countries call it differently\n\n\nIn in San Francisco it's called Bart B-A-R-T so you call it\ndifferently\n\n\nThere are five of us alright and each of us have different names for\nit\n\n\nHow on earth are we going to find it\n\n\nSo we have Subject Headings to standardize all these terms\n\n\nAnother example is like battered women or abused women\n\n\nYou say battered women\n\n\nI say abused women\n\n\nIf we don't see things eye to eye we don't meet each other and talk\nabout the same things nobody will be able to find out anything\n\n\nYou won't be able to find out the articles or the books that I write\nand I won't be able to find out what you have written on that particular\nsubject\n\n\nSo you have to standardize\n\n\nSo that's why we use the Library of Congress of Subject headings so\nyou don't use your own uhm keywords or terms in it\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nThen you have the Series Title\n\n\nAh that's another tricky one because a lot of students type in the\ntitle of the journal under Series Title and you can't find it at all\n\n\nOne very good example very good illustration of umm Series Title is\nMills and Boons\n\n\nThat's a Series Title\n\n\nOkay\n\n\n\n\n\nSome books they have to this particular series that's used but you\nknow I think Mills and Boons is a very very good example okay\n\n\nKeywords\n\n\nKeyword is a particular word which appears in all the various fields\nmeaning these are fields Titles Personal Authors\n\n\nThis is one field\n\n\nThis is second field\n\n\nThis is third field\n\n\nOkay Keywords\n\n\nLike the keyword Japan\n\n\nIt can appear in Title\n\n\nIt can appear in Organisation\n\n\nIt can appear in Subject Series Title\n\n\nSo maybe if you look under Titles Japan there are hundred titles\n\n\nIt says Japan and Singapore\n\n\nThe people of Japan\n\n\nThe women of Japan or something like that\n\n\nAll the books with titles\n\n\nJapan now I don't know if anybody's anybody has been called Japan\n\n\nNah you can try\n\n\nWe've Organisations like uh MITI you know uhm whatever Japan trade\nand industry that sort of thing\n\n\nSubject Headings Japan and then Japan is subdivided into History\nLiterature uhm Economy Transportation\n\n\nOkay you use Title Keywords\n\n\nSo when you use Keywords it picks up from all the various fields so\naltogether you might end up to a thousand\n\n\nLet's say this is five hundred\n\n\nThis is a hundred\n\n\nThis is another two hundred so you know it picked up\n\n\nSo that's that's where you get the keyword and the danger about\nusing Keywords is that you might end up retrieving information that you don't\nneed\n\n\nYou want Japanese foreign policy\n\n\nIf you use Keyword you just type in Japan it lists out everything\nand anything on Japan\n\n\nJapan and arts and culture\n\n\nJapan Japanese History Japanese politics Japanese humour Japanese\nfilms\n\n\nSo you have to be careful you have to know what you're searching for\n\n\nBut that does not mean that you only stop at one\n\n\nIf you're going to do Japan foreign policy you just stick to Subject\nheadings\n\n\nWhen you're searching for information that's not that's not the way\n\n\nJust imagine you're a detective you have to cover all the various\nangles so you have to try the Titles\n\n\nYou have to try Subject headings as well as Keywords\n\n\nOkay I'll show you what I'll show it to you but if I do that I have\nto start this all over again\n\n\nI'll just demonstrate the Title features\n\n\nOkay how do you know whether that particular title is a book or a\njournal\n\n\nDo you guess from the title\n\n\nOkay I'll use Title alright\n\n\nThe Asian Survey\n\n\nIt's only one journal The Asian Survey but it come up comes out\ntwice because this one has no full-stop and this one has full-stop\n\n\nThis is all part of computer technology\n\n\nOkay when you get this you press A\n\n\nOkay this is the full display\n\n\nWhen you only have one title they will automatically give you the\nfull display\n\n\nFull display the difference is you have Subject\n\n\nYou have Names here\n\n\nYou don't have you see in a brief display you don't have all these\nthings\n\n\nVolume for March nineteen sixty one ecetera ecetera okay\n\n\nOkay I'll show you the brief format\n\n\nJust type B for brief format\n\n\nThis is the brief format\n\n\nHow do you know find how do you know whether it's a journal or not\n\n\nLook at at this Copy Description Volume one nineteen sixty one dash\n\n\nIt does not mean we only have nineteen sixty one\n\n\nWe 've started buying from nineteen sixty one onwards dash that\nthere're still others\n\n\nIf you see an asterisk that means nineteen sixty one dash nineteen\nseventy asterisk that means the last issue that we have is nineteen seventy\n\n\nIf you have books you're looking at books they don't have this\n\n\nSo that's the difference\n\n\nThat's how you find out\n\n\nAnything can be in Tamil\n\n\nIt can be in in whatever in Greek or in Russian you see that you\nknow\n\n\nCall number\n\n\nThe call number is this one\n\n\nOr that's uhm some of the let's say you see U asterisk whatever it\nis okay\n\n\nAh those some those are just part of our cataloging rules so that\none that's alright you see\n\n\nOh small f means folio stands for folio\n\n\nFolio means books that are not uh bigger than normal size so we\nusually shelve them at the last two shelves because we cannot accommodate\nthem in the normal size shelves\n\n\nYou see most of the books are about what this twenty-three inches or\nsomething like\n\n\nI think two cm then if it's uh bigger than that you think you're\ngonna have usually the last\n\n\nLet's say you have DA from D to DZ so after DZ of the normal size\nbooks then you have the folio books\n\n\nThe f books okay\n\n\nOkay because of system fully integrated you only see CL\n\n\nThat means if it's fully integrated you see CLMS which is main\nshelves main shelf meaning also open shelf\n\n\nYou can borrow the book\n\n\nCLBP Bound Periodicals\n\n\nCLCS Close Stack that means we cannot put all our materials\nespecially journals on the shelf \n\n\nWe just don't have space so the material that's kept in Bound\nPeriodicals starts from nineteen eighty to nineteen eighty-nine to nineteen\nninety and the rest will be in our Close Stack our storeroom so you have to\ngo to the query counter fill in a search card or a Close Stack slip this one\nmhm mhm then the staff will go down twice a day to hoo collect your books\nthat you've requested if you come in now and ask them to do it you know you\nhave to wait you know because they only go down twice a day we can't afford\nto do that all the time because we have a whole stack of slips <&>  student)\nPast year For those that are no no no no those are kept those are the uh uhm\nthe the bound periodicals you can jolly well go down and get it but those\nprior to that from nineteen sixty one to let's say nineteen seventy-nine okay\nthey're kept in our uh uhm storeroom okay uhm those are journals same with\nsome books where especially when we have multiple copies too many copies okay\nright now it can't really tell you you can check with query counter whether\nthe book is on loan or not just cannot tell Maybe if you've used National\nLibrary system you can see that you know each volume or each each year it\ndepends on how they bound they bind it will have uhm different bar code\nnumber and you know then you'll have to scroll through from nineteen\nsixty-one that's assuming that nineteen six each year has been bound one\nvolume so you have let's say until seventy-one there're ten so on about\nthirty volumes but there are some journals that start from eighteen something\neighteen eighty-eight so you just have to sit down and scroll through page by\npage and page until you find out the volume you're looking for That's\njournals for you okay do you have any particular title in mind That you want\nto search  Okay you want to go  okay if you want to go\nback to the other page you just press R for reselect reselect  you\nhave uh let's say twenty items okay anytime you want to get out you either\npress uhm function eight I think you need to stop or you press full stop\nreturn let's see okay let's look at I mean you know when you use Keywords or\nwhen you use Subject Headings or Titles don't be so foolish as to type in\nlet's say Indonesia because you'll get a million and one items okay you get\nyou have this right If okay this is item number one and for this particular\nheading there is one alright so your main the main thing is to get this so ah\nlet's say you want to look at number four which is Indonesia - a Profile If\nyou press four press enter it'll show you what you just selected then let's\nsay you want to look at number four number thirteen number twenty-seven okay\nanytime you want to go back you just press R okay then you have to use the\nGather function which is G you can add another key word if you want let's say\nkeyword you just press key and then you get what you want okay let's say you\nuse Gather four press enter for next page press G again let's say eleven\nuntil fifteen after you've gathered all those things then you press L for\nList anythime you want to go back you know don't worry you know you can\nalways go stan  just press R for reselect okay In Process you've\nseen that before haven't you In Process that means we're still processing the\nbook and six million dollar question is when will it arrive don't know when\nokay when will it appear okay you know this right This is Law main shelf Law\nlibrary Central library call number one so in future everything will be like\nthis and then you have the number of copies so you don't have to go round\nsearching asking everybody how many copies do you have in the library

{"text": "<$A>\n\n\nGood afternoon\n\n\nAh my name is Iris Ching and and I'm the Software Consultants\n\n\nWelcome you to our this Easy Asset II and Easy Cash seminar\n\n\nSo uh before I explain into our package of uh computerising the Fixed\nAsset which is the first session of the seminar and the second session will\nbe on Easy Cash which is the general ledger package plus the cash management\nsystem session I will like to briefly explain ah what actually how you can\nsuccessfully use our package to computerise your system\n\n\nOkay uh our system runs mainly all on PC-base and uh you could use a\nIBM compatible PC or running on an MS-DOS system which can be running on\nversion five or below and uh it goes on an unlimited databased system okay\n\n\nNow if you are looking into uh how many of you are actually looking\ninto a G/L package over here\n\n\nYourself is it\n\n\nAnd uh what kind of G/L package you are looking into\n\n\nA multiuser or a single-user\n\n\nSingle-user\n\n\nSo it's no problem because our system runs on a \nsingle-user basis and it has this ah multi passwords whereby you will give you \nthis security purposes and uh what about yourself\n\n\nEileen\n\n\nNot at the moment\n\n\nYa I have seen ah in <unclear> word </unclear> and you are also\nlooking into Fixed Asset system\n\n\nYou are looking into that\n\n\nAh okay this Easy Asset II is a new upgrade or we call it a new\nrelease version for this year\n\n\nPreviously we know it's known as Easy Asset and the package for this\none compared to the old version there's a difference is this one goes\nunlimited database\n\n\nThe other version is limit up to a thousand five of records it can\nenter\n\n\nNow this one goes unlimited so you don't have to worry about the Easy\nAsset II\n\n\nIf you have number on or you call the volume of assets increasing per\nyear then you will not have this problem of you know up to a certain limit\nyou cannot carry on your system\n\n\nSo okay let me run down this system for you so that you could\nunderstand better of the features and also the operations of it\n\n\nNow as you can see this is the introduction whereby it tells you that\nthis package is developed by our own company and it's developed in Singapore\nokay specially for the Singapore office but we also cater for oversea office\nbecause Fixed Asset system is more or less quite uh I should say it's quite\nconsistent throughout internationally\n\n\nThe laws of uh supposing like the functions like depreciation by how\nmany straight line methods and all that or balancing on reducing balance or\ndouble declining balance\n\n\nSo it's more or less quite standard in the sense\n\n\nOkay the first thing you can see that over over your left side if I'm\ngoing to sit this way it's going to be over my left side the database window\nis goes unlimited database so you can have number of databases there\n\n\nDoes not matter\n\n\nIt can scroll on and on\n\n\nYou have number of companies if you are using just one package to\ncontrol number of companies' assets\n\n\nSo you can just use a macro key and zoom into any one of these\ndatabase that you already built in the system\n\n\nOkay let's say this is the database that you have put in the system\ncall the EA2SAM and you are going into the period\n\n\nOkay the fiscal period depends on how you identify your fiscal period\n\n\nLet's say you go into a fiscal period of twelve which is you classify\nthat now your fiscal period is December\n\n\nOkay and you proceed on enter your password\n\n\nNow your password here allows you you can see it allows you more than\nenough okay\n\n\nAnd right over here once you enter into this password you will come\nto the actual main menu and you can start having your computerisation\n\n\nFirst of all building the parameter set\n\n\nOkay under this parameter set you have what you call miscellaneous\nparameters where this is where you set up\n\n\nOkay you're start off computerisation fiscal period\n\n\nIs it you're starting as a fiscal period six\n\n\nOkay let's say it's six is your fiscal period\n\n\nNow you can see the change automatically over there\n\n\nThe period end date which means your first fiscal period accounting\nmonth is on June\n\n\nThirtieth of June nineteen-ninety-one ending and your last fiscal\nperiod twelve will be ending thirty-first May nineteen-ninety-two\n\n\nYou do not have to go into that particular parameters to set the date\n\n\nThere is an auto-control\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nNow if you set your this first accounting period first fiscal\naccounting period month as one which is January\n\n\nNow you go and change go right into a company's name you can see that\nit overrides your first fiscal period becomes thirty-first January ninety-one\nand your ending fiscal period twelve is thirty-first December ninety-one\n\n\nSo this is how our system controls over the parameters now if you are\ngoing into the subsequent years of ninety-two\n\n\nOkay all you require is you put in the current accounting year which\nis ninety-two\n\n\nNow you can see over there on the period end-date it has\nautomatically change for you to nineteen-ninety-two\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nSo this is how the computerisation helps you to speed up in certain\nways of control\n\n\nAnd right over here you put in the company's profile which is your\ncompany's name the address and the other information\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nOver here you can see that you will have to enter the standard\ncurrency\n\n\nOkay your standard currency can be you can controlled as US dollar as\nyour standard company's currency or you use Singapore dollar as a standard\ncurrency control\n\n\nSo you can enter over here and this means that how many decimal place\nare you giving two decimal or four decimal place\n\n\nSo you can use it over here and all currency name now this one will\nbe in US dollar or maybe you want it to be an alternate currency in Malaysian\ndollar or whichever other cur country currencies you want it to be an\nalternate currency\n\n\nNow the decimal place is up to you to identify and the exchange rate\nis also up to your company's standard company's exchange rate\n\n\nAnd over here the you will also have this what you call the capital\nallowances whether you are allowing the capital allowance less initial amount\nor full amount\n\n\nSo it's up to you to set the parameters over here\n\n\nNow your full-year depreciation or prorated when we talk about\nfull-year depreciation means you're taking a full-year depreciation to equal\nso that you will divide by twelve month\n\n\nYour depreciation will be spread out equally okay for the twelve\nmonths\n\n\nLet's said if one asset is twelve thousand so you use full-year\nyou're spread out twelve thousand divide by twelve equals to one thousand per\nmonth\n\n\nThat will be the depreciation amount\n\n\nNow if you are taking a pro-rate it means it will pro-rate\naccordingly by the month so you will pro-rate for example by the date that\nyou acquire starts\n\n\nOkay you depreciate according to that date and you pro-rate\naccordingly by rounding up the amount that is to certain months\n\n\nSo this is the method that you could identify over here in the\nparameters\n\n\nNow spaces between labels is up to you to identify what type of\nlabels you are actually using to print numeric the asset labels for your\ncompany and you also have the audit <unclear> word </unclear> and right over\nhere you have the location of DOS location of document custom\n\n\nNow this location means a lot of people ask what is this location\nmeans Now this location means you can actually default okay in the C drive or\nD drive accordingly or you can have it set a default into the A drive by\nputting this function in this odd manner and under this directory okay and\nthe file name or whatever will be default in the A drive or C drive or D\ndrive\n\n\nOkay if you set it you set it this way and right over here let me\ntake this out for you okay\n\n\nNow right over here you can see that there are a number of colours\nfor you to select\n\n\nTwo hundred and fifty-five colours\n\n\nSo you can if you feel tired of any of the colours you want to play\naround with other colours you can just switch over with the help of this box\ncolour here\n\n\nNow right over here will be your set-up of the column paper width\n\n\nOkay now if you are using a printer which is eighty column width then\nyou identify as eighty okay\n\n\nIf you are using a printer that is for printing of hundred and\nthirty-two column width paper you can override this eighty column to hundred\nand thirty-two column width\n\n\nSo this will enables you to set accordingly to your company's printer\nconfigurations and it has this special condensed intelligence of the reports\n\n\nUh the modes for you for example if the reports exceed hundred and\nthirty-two which is for the eighty column width it come to hundred and\nthirty-two maximum\n\n\nNow the system will condense the reports automatically for you\nwithout having you to set the kind of condense mode\n\n\nOkay now if you save this parameter and you only do it once you don't\nwant to come back and change and change again you only change it every\nbeginning of the year and okay the next step you go is the update of codes\n\n\nNow you may a codes for category the supplier code country subgroup\nlocation G\\L account number and you may have cost centre number and let's go\ninto one of this\n\n\nOkay let me go into the category I'll show it to you\n\n\nNow under this category code you may want to identify you may want to\nidentify a certain code\n\n\nNow this code is four limit to four alphanumeric code\n\n\nYou can have E001 or something else that you like to call or EA01 or\nyou can even identify this way all in alpha but it's four alphanumeric\n\n\nOkay now from here the description is up to you to identify what you\nwant to call Fixed Asset okay equipment you may call an equipment\n\n\nNow the next one you may want to call something like FF which is\nFixtures and Fitting okay and you may want to fix up this one as this\ndescription\n\n\nSo let's save this one into the window so you will have what you call\nuh FF code and it's the description is considered as Fixtures and Fittings\nokay\n\n\nAfter this you may want to continue okay updating or creating the\nother codes\n\n\nNow you don't have to get out of this windows\n\n\nAll you need is just press and F five key which is the macro key to\nhelp you to select into the others build a supplier code and or go into a\ncountry okay to establish at the other codes for you\n\n\nOkay let's say you want to build another country codes like uh\nMalaysia\n\n\nSo you just key in M one it can be alphanumeric also and you put\nMalaysia okay\n\n\nSo this one will enable you to carry on okay building doing all the\nother codes without having to to be out of this function\n\n\nNow you can also go into cost centre and then start building your\ncost centre codes and descriptions\n\n\nSo if you have completely okay set up the parameters for all this you\ncan just come out of this function and go into the printing modes\n\n\nNow you can print all this that you already actually set up the table\ncodes okay and right here system passwords\n\n\nAfter having all this set up you can go into what you call a system\npassword where you can just build a system password for a certain level of\npeople \n\n\nYou can have master you can have the other stock levels so that\nonly certain level of people can get assess to certain functions only", "subdomain": "SINGAPORE_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":
