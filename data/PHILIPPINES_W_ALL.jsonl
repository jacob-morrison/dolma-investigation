{"text": "by John Bert Rodriguez\n\n \n\nI attended the talk of Mr.  Ramil de la Vega  last Saturday\nwith the hope that it will help me have a better grasp on the ideas of\npost-modernism.\n\n\nI was not very disappointed in the end but the lack of clear\ndefinitions in his talk made the entire post-modernist idea on tribal\npolitics very uncertain or somewhat loose.\n\n\nLast year, when his talk was on post-modernism 's pioneer Bruno Bauer,\nI kept hearing Marx instead of Bauer 's ideas.\n\n\nThis is because of his fascination with comparing modernism with\npost-modernism.\n\n\nIn this talk, it was his fascination with too many examples that made\npost-modernism a foreign language again.\n\n\nThe lack of clear set of definitions on its components before giving\nfurther examples or real situations made his talk wobbly.\n\n\nThere was still direction though. \n\n \n\nI tried to come up with notes in his talk but unfortunately I was\nonly able to grasp a couple of ideas that struck me.\n\n\nPost-modernism 's stress on the power of the State shows its attack\non modernists.\n\n\nMost modernists have stressed on either the totality of the State 's\npowers or the uselessness of the State.\n\n\nPost-modernism emphasizes the importance of the basis of the State 's\ndecisions on rationality.\n\n\nAlthough the movement underscores the monopoly of decision making on\nthe State, there should still be reason in every decision.\n\n\nThis makes the state still accountable to the individual.\n\n\nThe individual is an important factor in the post-modernist view on\npolitics.\n\n\nIt believes that the interests of individuals cannot be discounted in\nfavor of other things.\n\n\nThe interest of the individual should be respected by the State.\n\n\nThis only means that politics can never be organized totally.\n\n\nPost-modernism sees politics as a chaotic world.\n\n\nDifferent individuals have different interests and these make the\npolitical world diverse. \n\n \n\nMr.  De la Vega  gave concrete situations to show the gist\nof post-modernism.\n\n\nTribal politics in the Philippines seemed perfect for proving the\nclaims of the post-modernist movement.\n\n\nThe present turncoating of our national leaders to suit their\nindividual interests show the chaos in politics because of its conflict with\nthe interests of the individual.\n\n\nThe EDSA uprisings in the meantime still reveals the accountability\nof the State to individuals especially when it stops functioning well.\n\n\nI honestly think that Mr.  De la Vega  have a good grasp on\npost-modernism and its manifestations in present time.\n\n\nHowever, to keep the talk in one direction and clear was his big\nproblem.\n\n\nAs for now, post-modernism remains unconnected set of ideas in my\nmind.\n\n\nThere are book definitions of post-modernism that I 've read but they\ndon't connect with the post-modernism Mr.  De la Vega  talked about in\nhis two lectures that I attended.  \n\n\n\n\n  INTPHIL ( Talk on Post-Modernism)  \n\n\nby Benedict T. Navarro\n\n \n\nMy friends and I arrived at the William Shaw Little Theatre\nfifteen minutes ahead of the scheduled time.\n\n\nWe took the seats on the fifth row because we really wanted to hear\nwhatever the speaker has to say for that symposium.\n\n\nSince we were the early birds present in the said theatre, we stared\nat the technical team as they fixed the stage.\n\n\nWhile watching a guy setting the overhead projector, there was a\ntransparency projected that caught our attention.\n\n\nIt was a transparency that has this word printed on it, \"\n\" Psychology. &rdquo; \"\n\n\nIt made us laugh because we thought that we had attended a wrong\nseminar.\n\n\nImagine, it was in \" Philosophy \" where we got our\ntickets and it was in our system that everything would be related to\n\" Philosophy \" .\n\n\nWe did not expect any psychology-related-thing just to pop-out in\nthat particular talk. \n\n \n\nTwenty minutes later, a guy in his shabby   barong\n  stood up and introduced the guest-speaker for that afternoon.\n\n\nThe introduced-speaker accepted the applause with a smile and started\nto talk.\n\n\nHonestly, I was so shocked to hear whatever he told us all throughout\nthat two-hour symposium.\n\n\nI could not think of a way, during that time, to connect state policy\ntheory, tribal politics, and  etc.  to the topics we were\ndiscussing in our past meetings.\n\n\nIt seemed to me that the talk was more fitted to my last term 's\nsubject - \" Politics and Governance \" .\n\n\nI just do not know right now if I was close-minded during the talk\nbecause I really expected something about Socrates, Homer, Empedocles, and\nother stuffs related to \" Philosophy \" .\n\n\nIn spite of the frustrations, I listened to whatever he was saying as\na sign of my courtesy and because of my thirst of knowledge regarding\nPolitics of today. \n\n \n\nIn the talk the speaker said, and let me cite it,  \n\" Post-modern political system is tribal in nature. &rdquo; \n\n\n\nWhatever the politicians of today do to cover-up with glitters the\nrecent political system, its barbaric and tribal essence still shows up.\n\n\nTechnically speaking, the post-modern political system should ensure\na consolidated public trust.\n\n\nHowever, because of the politicians ' self-vested interests this idea\nis now becoming fast obsolete.\n\n\nYes, we call the political system that we have today as a post-modern\npolitical system as what those  politics-know-how  people told us to\ncall it; but, it is crystal clear that most of the ingredients from the\ntribal politics still exist.\n\n\nSuch ingredients are manifested in different areas of concern (\n i.e.  strategies, elements, and agent 's\nresponsibilities).\n\n\nIt is true, and I know readers will agree with me that the strategies\nof today 's   TRAPO   ( traditional politicians) are\nseduction of agents ( citizens), suspicion and panic in the side of the\nagent, and manipulation of interest.\n\n\nThese strategies were present during the tribal politics.\n\n\nMoreover, the elements of tribal politics are still present today\nsuch as politics of desire, politics of fear, and politics of certainty. \n\n \n\nIt is absurd to refer to our contemporary political system as a\n\" POST-MODERN \" if in reality it is just a recycled tribal\npolitics. \n\n \n\nAllow me to slightly divert my reaction on some current issues\nthat we have today.\n\n\nThe politics specifically in the Philippines is such a big \nfa&ccedille;ade  - a big show on air.\n\n\nI just do not know if whatever we hear and we see concerning today 's\nPhilippine politics is just created and eventually sensationalized by the\nmass media, but we can get a small portion out of the big picture that it\nreally is just a show.\n\n\nPoliticians change parties from time to time not because of\nprinciples but because of their selfish desires. \n\n \n\nIndeed, whatever the debunked tribal politics possessed is just\ncoming back into life but of new form, with new key players, having slightly\nmodified strategies to match up with today 's level of thinking.  \n\n\n\n\n  Talk on Post-Modernism  \n\n\n Reaction Paper \n\n\nPuno, Pia\n\n \n\nFrankly, I found the talk on Post-Modernism boring.\n\n\nAnd I know I 'm not alone, because as I glanced around the room, out\nof sheer boredom and desperation to do something else, I saw most of the\npeople going off into dreamy dreamland.\n\n\nI myself dozed off, my   \" five-minute lapses\n&rdquo;   as I call it.\n\n\nPolitics just doesn't interest me.\n\n\nMaybe if the speaker, Dr.  De la Vega  , talked about a\ndifferent realm of philosophy, like those of Aristotle and Socrates and those\nother smart dead guys, now those would be more up my speed!\n\n\nNot to mention, most of the things he discussed I 've already heard [\nand learned?] from my previous POLIGOV class just last term.\n\n\nActually it was a  little  interesting to hear the speaker\nmention some familiar terms, it redeemed my waning faith that I  did\n and  do  learn something from my past classes! \n\n \n\nIn fairness, boring as it was, I did take down quite a  few\n notes [ surrounded by  a lot  of doodles!], of which I will\ngive an overview.\n\n\nThe speaker discussed the  State Policy Theory  ,\nsomething that 's not new to me, which determines the rationality of a\npolicy.\n\n\nHe also discussed the  Modern Political Arena  , of\nwhich policy-making is and should be monopolized by the Nation-State, though\nit could not interfere with theory-making.\n\n\nHe then talked about the  Post-Modern Political Arena  ,\nin which the erosion of state 's monopoly on policy-making is attributed to:\n( 1) the inability to accommodate the accumulated needs of interest groups;\nand ( 2) the scarcity of resources.\n\n\nUnder Post-Modern Politics are: ( 1) Relative Placidity; ( 2)\nGrievance; ( 3) Discontent; and ( 4) Protest.\n\n\nThen there 's  Tribal Politics  , where three strategies\nwere mentioned: ( 1) Seduction of Agents; ( 2) Suspicion and Panic; and ( 3)\nManipulation of Interest.\n\n\nIts three elements were also discussed: ( 1) Politics of Desire; ( 2)\nPolitics of Fear; and ( 3) Politics of Certainty.\n\n\nLastly, the responsibilities of the agents were stated, namely: ( 1)\nCritical attitude towards issues; ( 2) Active participation; and ( 3)\nVigilance. \n\n \n\nSee maybe if we were to talk about the smart dead guys, I might\njust go into my   \" three-minute lapses &rdquo; \n instead of five.  \n\n\n\n\n  Like Hungry Infants  \n\n\nBy Jewel Castro\n\n \n\nEverything, everything, is inescapably intertwined with \"\nDesire \" .\n\n\nBack at the William Shaw Little Theater, I could just see my\nminiature \" Buddha \" - with his enormous stomach, shiny bald\nhead and infectious smile - squealing with smug delight as Mr.  De la Vega\n discussed just how the Philippine state has become a willing prostitute\nto the caprices of non-state elements of society.\n\n\nYes, international law, interest groups and gullible masses are\nhungrily, wantonly leering at the government as it holds the reins of\npolicy-making. \n\n \n\nWell, okay, not just leering.\n\n\nMore like seizing it by the neck and shackling it like a puppet. \n\n \n\nAdvisers in Malaca&ntilde;ang probably sound like this:  'Iffy.\n\n\nVery iffy, Madam President.\n\n\nThe SWS results haven't arrived yet.'  \n\n \n\nOne characteristic of Philippine politics is the inconsistency in\nthe acceptance of policies.\n\n\nA senator, for instance, would announce his stand on a certain\ncontroversial issue.\n\n\nAfter being criticized by the media and verbally stoned by the people\nthrough surveys and phone-in radio shows, he would twist his purposefully\nambiguous statement into something more suitable to the public.\n\n\nHe would also, of course, promise a short-term solution that would\nappease the people for a while, then blow up like a time bomb in a year or\nso. \n\n \n\nPlato ( if he were to follow Hollywood-Night-of-the-Living-Dead\ntradition) would probably rise with his grimy body from his grave if he\nlearned of the circumstances in the Philippine political arena.\n\n\n 'What?'  he would exclaim,  'Where 's your\ntheory?\n\n\nWhere 's your Reason?\n\n\nWhere is your frigging immutable, eternal and PERFECT innate\nknowledge, for  Demiurgo  's sake?!'  \n\n \n\nHe would have a reason to be enraged because \" Reason\n\" is being subsumed by the emotions and desires of some sectors -\n\" 'some' \" being the operative term, because, as Mr.  De\nla Vega  had put it,  'it is humanly impossible'  to\naccommodate the wants of all sectors of society. \n\n \n\nPolitical theory  'determines the moral foundation of\ngovernment policy',  and  'selects the most rational choice.'\n\n\n\nIt is systematically organized, and it serves to legitimize\ngovernment policy.\n\n\nOn the contrary, the post-Modernist view emphasizes that it is\nimportant to seduce, if possible, all citizens into trusting and supporting\nthe politicians because it is their trust that legitimizes the government 's\nactions. \n\n \n\nThis process of seduction has resorted to embarrassing singing\nand dancing onstage, complete with matinee idols and sexy dancers, just to\nwin the electorate 's heart. \n\n \n\nMachiavelli is leering at me and nudging my rib. \n\n \n\n 'The end justifies the means,'  he says. \n\n \n\nBut not for me, not for Socrates. \n\n \n\nBesides, the ends of most politicians are not so good anyway.\n\n\nTheir ends are their own self-interests.\n\n\nThey are not concerned about the good of the people; they only care\nabout their personal vested interests.\n\n\nFor them, policy is just a product of the deliberation on what\npolicy would accommodate the most number of sectors, on which move would\nplease the most people.\n\n\nHence Ramos ' proposition of a \" 'rainbow coalition'\n\" which tries to consolidate all sectoral interests into one policy\nof governance. \n\n \n\nThe citizens are not much better off, either.\n\n\nInterest groups are observed to be pushing for policies that would\nprovide them with the most gain, and since they are very capable of creating\nhype in conjunction with the media, their effects are becoming more and more\npervasive.\n\n\nVoters would go for candidates whom they think would put food on\ntheir tables or support their businesses, regardless of any fixed standard or\nmoral premise.  ***\n\n \n\nI was glad that the underlying forces behind social weather and\nrallies and cheap propaganda have finally arranged themselves into\nnear-coherence in my head.\n\n\nThe lecture about tribal politics painted quite a familiar and\naccurate picture of the Philippines at present and I could not help but smile\nsardonically at the absurdity of it. \n\n \n\nIt becomes apparent that people seem to no longer have any inner\nconviction towards what they fight for.\n\n\nThere seems to be an absence of righteous indignation in its truest\nsense; even big political movements are just convenient guises for what I\npersonally deem as ignorance and conformity.\n\n\nTheir cries, however loud, no longer sound like the Platonic echoes\nof  \" souls yearning for perfection &rdquo;  ; they are\nlike the instinctive wails of a hungry infant. \n\n \n\nOr has it always been that way? \n\n \n\nHume would nod vigorously. \n\n \n\nPlato would suggest aristocracy. \n\n \n\nAnd Freud would ....\n\n\nehehehe ... \n\n \n\nAs for me ... \n\n \n\nEr ... \n\n \n\nArgh.\n\n\nMath is so much easier.  \n\n \n\nP.

{"text": "I am having a lot of trouble focusing on work and studies these\ndays because the issue of the NGEC has not stopped haunting me.\n\n\nSo, since I can't seem to get away from the issue, and am congenitally\nunable to absorb theory unless I see it through the prism of reality first, I\nmight as well bring NGEC and similarly bothersome matters into my response\npapers.\n\n\nHere goes: \n\n\n THE \" STREAMLINED &rdquo; CURRICULUM: \" FETISHIZATION\n&rdquo; IN PROGRESS \n\n\nMa. Theresa Wright\n\n \n\nFirst, some clarifications on an important term in the title\nabove: \" \" streamlined &rdquo; \" is how some of our\nuniversity administrators would like to describe the New General Education\nCurriculum, the details of which are still being hammered out though the\ngeneral idea behind it is already clear: to rid the curriculum of certain\nHumanities courses believed to be redundant, or irrelevant, or ( horrors!)\ninimical to the interests of globalization.\n\n\nAmong the candidates for reduction or excision in this \"\nstreamlining &rdquo; are Literature and Pilipino ( oh, so irrelevant to the\ntimes and so unprofitable are they!).\n\n\n\" \" Streamlined. &rdquo; \"\n\n\nThat 's some signifier, invoking thoughts of ( and yearnings for)\nstability, economy, efficiency: signifieds so dear to administrators '\nhearts.\n\n\nSome of us in the DLWF faculty, however, feel that administration can\njust stuff that signifier and the new curriculum up their\nsignifieds-which-share-a-signifier-with-donkeys ( a wonderful illustration,\nbtw, of the arbitrariness of the sign).\n\n\nFrom where we stand, there should be better adjectives for the new\ncurriculum: \" \" reduced &rdquo; \" is a possible\nchoice, or if we want a term with more graphic significations, \"\n\" mangled. &rdquo; \"\n\n\nOr perhaps we can express our opinion of the new curriculum even\nbetter with its own initials which, quite serendipitously, match a sign\ncommonly used in the linguistic community of this time, of this place, as an\ninterjection: \" NGEC! \"\n\n\n( Elsewhere - is it at UP or CHED? - the globalization-oriented\ncurriculum is labeled \" \" Revised General Education Curriculum,\n&rdquo; \" or RGEC for short.\n\n\nNow if this linguistic community were to adopt those initials as a\nsign, they would have an onomatopoeic signifier that yields a whole slew of\nsignifieds, from a frog vocalizing on a lilypad, to a puddle of \nvomitus  .)\n\n\nThat being said, on to more important matters: Sid 's extremely\nhelpful and instructive discussion of Mitchell 's essay on Marxism, ideology,\nand fetishism, and how this relates to the NGEC issue. \n\n \n\nI 'd like to pick up the point Sid makes at the end of his\ndiscussion: that in this essay Mitchell  \" underlines the\nhistorical place of the image in the articulation of ideas, such that\ntextuality is bound to imagery in a relationship of mutual translation.\n&rdquo;\n\n\nI understand this to mean that to Mitchell, images do not just\nmaterialize out of the blue but rather have their significations shaped by\ntexts, even as they also shape the significations of texts, within specific\ndiscursive contexts.\n\n\nI like the way Mitchell, quoted by Sid, puts it:  \" we\ncreate much of our world out of the dialogue between verbal and pictorial\nrepresentation. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nIn the discourse surrounding the NGEC, verbal and pictorial\nrepresentations have been flying fast and furious.\n\n\nAmong the first \" signs &rdquo; to be invoked in defense of the\nNGEC were those of the University of the Philippines and Harvard University.\n\n\nIn this linguistic community, those two signs are instantly\nassociated with academic excellence and high intellectual standards.\n\n\nAnd the name \" \" UP &rdquo; \" comes to us with\na powerful pictorial representation - the \" Oblation \" -\nwhich, by association with the verbal representation, has acquired the same\nsignifications of excellence and intellectualism, to which the university 's\nhistory of activism has further added the signification of sacrifice for\ncountry.\n\n\n\" \" Harvard, &rdquo; \" at least to me, evokes\nno non-verbal images, but few academics, I imagine, would  not \nrespond with knee-jerk respect and awe for that institution 's place in\nAmerica 's educational history.\n\n\nAnd so Admi gives its opening salvo: the NGEC is modeled\nafter/inspired by the UP and Harvard curricula, both of which offer students\na pared-down core curriculum to which they would be free to add their choices\nfrom a list of courses categorized by disciplines.\n\n\nSubsequent research by one of our faculty has revealed that the first\ncurriculum proposal presented to us cannot even begin to compare with that of\nHarvard, but by linking it with a trend sweeping the globe, Admi has taken\nthe first step towards the NGEC 's fetishization.\n\n\nIn this country, the word \" \" global &rdquo; \"\nhas morphed into an alternative signifier for success and material progress,\nso anything linked to it is expected to find instant acceptability ( who\ndoesn't want success and progress, after all?).\n\n\nAcceptability is the cornerstone of any object 's fetishization -\nwithout it, no object can work its magic. \n\n \n\nBut Admi 's first attempt has been less than successful - has\nelicited hostility, in fact, so now it is sending forth new verbal\nrepresentations, among them one of Admi top brass being  \" upset\n&rdquo;  at having been so misrepresented and misunderstood.\n\n\nNew signifiers have also been appended to the top brass 's memo on\nthe NGEC ( the very memo that started the wheels turning): whereas with the\ninitial proposal, the memo was presented as \" \" orders, &rdquo;\n\" now that signifier has been replaced by \" \"\nsuggestion, &rdquo; \" meaning we can offer \" \"\ncounter-suggestions. &rdquo; \"\n\n\nAll this in an attempt to neutralize the \" enemy. &rdquo;\n\n\nBut  there 's the rub  , as Hamlet would say: Admi has\nset unshakable parameters of time and space for the shaping of\ncountersuggestions.\n\n\nTime - one month, or less than that by now, because a decision has to\nbe reached by term 's end.\n\n\nSpace - as in, intellectual/ideological space - we 'd have to create\nthat in the little time we have, because Admi , to whom the NGEC is not a\ndebatable issue but already a reality that only needs refining, certainly\nwon't give us any.\n\n\nFor Faculty, the ideological battle is the tougher one: for\ngenerations, literature and the national language held secure positions in\nschool curricula because they were widely accepted as signs of culture and\ncivilization.\n\n\nNow a globalizing environment is attaching to these signs a different\nset of signifiers which are inimical to their very survival - \"\n\" irrelevant, &rdquo; \" outdated, &rdquo; \" superfluous\n&rdquo; \" - signifiers which we will have to counter with another\nset that will protect these fields by making them acceptable to the \"\nglobalizers. &rdquo;\n\n\nHere, too, acceptability is the cornerstone, and linguistic\nappropriation may be one strategy we can use to achieve this: use the\nlanguage of the globalizers to defend our fields. \n\n \n\nAt this time, everything is in flux - everything, that is, except\nfor the concept of the NGEC.\n\n\nThat is in place, like it or not.\n\n\nWhat Admi is simply trying to do is find a formula for making it\naccepted first as a given, then as a desirable goal, then, ultimately, as the\none true path to educational progress.\n\n\nBy then, the NGEC will have already attained tangible form as a\ndocument, an object capable of being represented both verbally ( its\ncontents) and pictorially ( contents plus the paper on which they are\nwritten).\n\n\nBy then ( this is Admi 's wish which it will work mightily to\nachieve), the NGEC will have turned into DLSU 's fetish, a document perceived\nto be the embodiment of \" world-class &rdquo; education and therefore\nof intellectual and material progress in a single-economy world.\n\n\nHe/She who worships this fetish, of course, will be assured of a\nplace in the university, may even rise to its pantheon of gods - that is\nwhere the magic always lies in capitalist fetishism: the prospect of material\nsecurity and advancement within the system. \n\n \n\nThe NGEC discourse is a painful one, not just because of its\nimplications for literature, language, and culture, but because in order to\nwin the battle, Faculty may no longer use those signifiers which have, up to\nthis point, been part of their ideological vocabulary: heart, soul,\nprinciple, commitment, love, life.\n\n\nSometimes, progress destroys, and destroys absolutely.  \n\n\n\n\n  Position Paper # 3: Transcendence  \n\n\nNoelle Leslie G. de la Cruz \n\n \n\n \" ... The basic asymmetry that appears in the\ntraditional mythology of women stems from the official, male-dominated\nculture and is highly suggestive.\n\n\nOfficially, women are not as human as men...\n\n\nMythical woman is therefore hellish and heavenly beyond her male\ncounterpart.\n\n\nShe represents the extremes more than he, while he represents the\nmedians. &rdquo; \n\n\n- - Denise Lardner Carmody,  Mythological Woman  \n\n \n\nThe significance of myths has long been pointed out in the\ndifferent sciences, especially psychoanalysis and literature.\n\n\nOn a less intellectual and more down-to-earth plane, however, myths\nare simply tales to be enjoyed-not less for their ability to entertain and\nfascinate us, than for their ability to make us  think  . \n\n \n\nI think that despite their magical and enigmatic qualities, myths\nare primarily life-related; a whole thesis has been done suggesting that\nmyths may have been origins of philosophical systems.\n\n\nGiven such an exalted role in human existence, myths are consequently\npowerful sociopolitical instruments; and as Beauvoir argues, they have\nindubitably been employed in the service of patriarchy. \n\n \n\nBeing a woman ( who loves myths), I received with a mixture of\nawe and dismay Beauvoir 's ( 1949: 197) proposition that  \" [\nman] projects upon [ woman] what he desires and what he fears, what he loves\nand what he hates. \n\n\nAnd if it is so difficult to say anything specific about her, that\nis because man seeks the whole of himself in her and because she is All.\n&rdquo;  \n\n\nUsing an existentialist framework, Beauvoir here interprets the\nOtherness of woman as being correlated with the in-itself; with man,\nnaturally, as the for-itself. \n\n \n\nLong before I 've ever heard of Sartre 's   en soi\n  and   pour soi   , I 've always\nregarded myself as the star player in my existence.\n\n\nIt would never have occurred to me back then that I could actually be\nthought of as an Other; as a being so conflated with diverse  and \nirreconcilable representations, meanings, functions, roles, and symbolism\nthat it is  impossible  to perform all of them-at least without\ngoing quietly insane.\n\n\nEven though a woman may inwardly refuse to assume these roles imposed\non her by masculine ideologies, nevertheless I observe that she often\nperceives it as a duty to  become  his Other; to jump through the\nhoops that society and culture ceaselessly throw in her general direction.\n\n\nI think she does this because she has never read Beauvoir 's\n\"  The Second Sex  \" ; and if she has, then either\nhasn't been convinced by Beauvoir or she has simply failed to understand\nBeauvoir. \n\n \n\nPerhaps I wouldn't exactly be exaggerating should I say that\nreading \"  The Second Sex  \" would leave one (\nespecially someone belonging to the second sex) with a permanently altered\nworldview.\n\n\nThe details and concerns that have previously appeared to be so\nnormal to oneself may become suddenly grotesque and disillusioning.\n\n\nFor those of us ( I assume this \" 'us' \" would\ninclude  na&iuml;ve  young women on the brink of 'twentyhood' )\nwho had nursed hundreds of versions of dreams of one day becoming a\nlover/wife/mother ( not necessarily in this order) may find ourselves\ncrash-landing painfully to earth.\n\n\nPersonally, after reading that excerpt from Beauvoir, I\nfelt...curiously deflated.\n\n\nAt the same time, I also felt empowered.\n\n\nStrange.\n\n\nPerhaps conflict is the destiny of woman? \n\n \n\nBarring such essentialist notions aside, I would say that I feel\nempowered because now, I feel as though my eyes had been truly opened to \nreality  ( to use the  clich\u00e9  ) .\n\n\nPerhaps I cannot change my circumstances overnight; and it may be\nimpossible to completely subvert the workings of tradition and culture.\n\n\nBut  at least  , I am aware of the Otherness that is imposed\non me. \n\n \n\nI used to \" hold on &rdquo; to things that are symbolically\nfeminine; things that have always been affirmed to be feminine.\n\n\nI suppose my environment had a lot to do with this; even now, I would\nsay that I am surrounded by ( well-meaning?) chauvinists for family, friends,\nrelative, and acquaintances.\n\n\nNot a day passes that I am not reminded that I should be this or\nthat; I should act this way and that; and sometimes, I should  feel \nthis way or that.\n\n\nI must admit though, that at one time I used to follow them in the\nmistaken assumption that this is how things should be. \n\n \n\nI was born a woman.\n\n\nAnd so therefore, I should  be  a woman.\n\n\nLittle did I know that most people 's definition of 'woman' is -\nwell, this is how Beauvoir puts it:  \" treasure, prey, sport and\ndanger, nurse, guide, judge, mediatrix, mirror, woman is the Other in whom\nthe subject transcends himself without being limited, who opposes him without\ndenying him; she is the Other who lets herself be taken without ceasing to be\nthe Other.... &rdquo;  ( Beauvoir, 1949: 186) \n\n \n\nIt still remains to be seen if I am indeed capable of the kind of\ntranscendence that Beauvoir talks about.\n\n\nI certainly would not hesitate to affirm myself as a subject.\n\n\nPerhaps it all boils down to learning how to think for oneself; to\nfinding the wherewithal by which to stand for the principles one believes in\n despite  the disapproval of others ( even and especially the \nmen  one loves, if one loves some).\n\n\nI think that to be truly feminist is to give up \" happiness\n&rdquo; as one had previously conceived it to be; and to redefine \"\nhappiness &rdquo; in terms of how one would live life, first and foremost,\n for oneself  and according to one 's wants and desires. \n\n\nReferences:\n\n\nBeauvoir, Simone de. 1949.

{"text": "BOOK REVIEW \n\n\nby  Amelia Santos \n\n \n\n The Woman Warrior: Memoirs of a Girlhood Among Ghosts \nby Maxine Hong Kingston is a story affixed with an exotic setting but dealing\nwith the same subjects as mainstream American feminist literature,\nspecifically the \" \" Me and Mom &rdquo; \" genre.\n\n\nThe book is seen as powerful because it confronts many aspects of\nwomen 's lives which are repeated in different cultures, especially the\nmale-female relationship and attitudes to that relationship within the\ncommunity.\n\n\nIt struggles with Maxine 's identity that reflects her gender ideas.\n\n\nWanting to show the audience that she is a woman warrior she conveyed\nthis in many ways by telling stories that reflected her personality or in her\nmind, her gender. \n\n \n\nFrom the very beginning of her life story \" \" No\nName Woman, &rdquo; \" Maxine reveals her childhood as a female.\n\n\nShe shows the reader her mother 's feelings about her Aunt who became\na family outcast for getting pregnant out of wedlock and finally drowned\nherself and her newborn baby in the family well after the villagers raided\nher house.\n\n\nBrave Orchid reveals this family secret to the young Maxine on the\nonset of the daughter 's menstruation to caution her against sexual\nindiscretion. \n\n\nQuoted from the story,   \" Don't let your father\nknow I told you.\n\n\nHe denies her.\n\n\nNow that you have started to menstruate, what happened to her could\nhappen to you.\n\n\nDon't humiliate us.\n\n\nYou wouldn't like to be forgotten as if you had never been born.\n\n\nThe villagers are watchful. &rdquo;   \n\n\nAt the same time, the mother attempts to suppress this story by\nforbidding the daughter to repeat it and instead wants her to be the perfect\nfemale for their family.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the man who got her aunt pregnant wanted to kill\nher because he did not want to be embarrassed, when actually it was his fault\njust as much hers. \n\n \n\nThis story is very intense and detailed, which starts the book\noff with the introduction of how women were portrayed.\n\n\nThis is frightening for Maxine because she feels that women are being\nwatched to make sure they are behaving the right way for society.\n\n\nMaxine shows us how she overcomes this womanly figure by turning into\na warrior thru the second story \" \" White Tigers &rdquo;\n\" .\n\n\nBased on the author 's version, the swordswoman studies martial arts\nfrom a pair of mysterious old couples and leads a peasant uprising against\nthe tyrannous emperor.\n\n\nAfter she decapitates the misogynist baron who has exploited her\nvillage and ruined her childhood, the swordswoman renounces her masculine\npower and returns to the traditional roles of daughter-in-law, wife, and\nmother. \n\n \n\nThe swordswoman describes how her parents carve their names,\nvows, and grievances on her back.\n\n\nAlthough undeniably an act of bodily mutilation, this act represents\na coveted family acknowledgment for Chinese and Chinese American women.\n\n\nFurthermore, the description of the script on the swordswoman 's back\nis a deliberate combination of physical and artistic beauty:  \n\" If an enemy should flay me, the light would shine through my skin\nlike lace. &rdquo;  \n\n\nThrough this revision of the chant of Fa Mu Lan, Maxine vicariously\nsatisfied her urgent desire for family recognition.\n\n\nHer gender has also proven to herself that she could be whoever she\nwants whether society agrees with her or not.\n\n\nIt tells us that people need to be proud of their gender whether male\nor female and as individuals we do not need to live up to anyone 's\nexpectations.\n\n\nWe represent our own gender but in our own individual ways.\n\n\nMaxine states many times how she rebelled against ideas for women.\n\n\n For example   \" There is an outward tendency in\nfemales, which meant that I was getting straight A 's for the good of my\nfuture husband 's family, not my own.\n\n\nI did not plan to ever have a husband.\n\n\nI would show my mother and father and the noisy emigrant villagers\nthat girls have no outward tendency.\n\n\nI stopped getting straight A 's. &rdquo;   \n\n \n\nThe mother 's story, \" \" Shaman, &rdquo; \"\nis situated in the middle of the book.\n\n\nAfter the deaths of her two children born in China, Brave Orchid\ndecided to leave her uneventful life in New Society Village to study medicine\nin Canton, the capital of the province.\n\n\nIn the medical school Brave Orchid earns outstanding grades and\nsummons the courage to challenge the \" Sitting Ghost\".\n\n\nShe volunteers to spend a night in a haunted room in the dormitory,\nreportedly defeats the ghost as it tries to attack her, and mobilizes the\nwhole student body to participate in her exorcising ritual.\n\n\nIn a sense Brave Orchid 's struggle with the Sitting Ghost is a\nsymbolic battle with the limits of traditionalism. \n\n \n\n\" The Woman Warrior \" not only chronicles the\ndevelopment of the daughter Maxine but also the mother 's struggle for\nself-definition.\n\n\n\" \" Shaman &rdquo; \" records Brave Orchid 's\npassage from a traditional woman to a respectable woman doctor.\n\n\nBack in her village Brave Orchid uses her intelligence to establish\nherself as a renowned doctor.\n\n\nLike the fantastic swordswoman portrayed earlier, Brave Orchid\n  \" has gone away ordinary and come back miraculous, like\nthe ancient magicians who came down from the mountains. &rdquo; \n \n\n \n\nBrave Orchid 's American daughter, must also learn to fight the\n\" ghosts &rdquo; in her life.\n\n\n\" The Woman Warrior \" is subtitled \" Memoirs\nof a Girlhood among Ghosts \" . \n\n\n \" Once upon a time, &rdquo;  the narrator\nrecalls,  \" the world was so thick with ghosts, I could barely\nbreathe; I could hardly walk, limping my way around the White Ghosts and\ntheir cars. &rdquo;  \n\n\nHer world of ghosts is a result of other parents ' refusal to\nacknowledge America and of the shadowy residues of the Chinese past in her\nchildhood and young-adult life.\n\n\nThe narrator protests,   \" whenever my parents said 'home,'\nthey suspended America.\n\n\nThey suspend America.\n\n\nThey suspended enjoyment, but I did not want to go to China. &rdquo;\n \n\n\nSignificantly, the reconciliation of the mother and the daughter in\n\" \" Shaman &rdquo; \" occurs after the mother finally\ngives up on the ancestral homeland.\n\n\n  \" We have no more China to go home to, &rdquo;\n  the aged Brave Orchid laments.\n\n\nThe daughter, now released from the \" ghost &rdquo; of China\nthat was imposed on her as a child, can freely acknowledge her matrilineal\nage:   \" I am really a Dragon, as she is a Dragon, both of\nus born in the dragon years.\n\n\nI am practically a first daughter of a first daughter. &rdquo; \n \n\n \n\nIn \" \" At the Western Palace, &rdquo; \"\nthe fourth section of \" The Woman Warrior \" , Maxine tells\nthe story of her other silent Chinese aunt, Moon Orchid.\n\n\nIt is the only third-person narrative in the book, and it\ncommunicates the hazard of poor adjustment to American reality.\n\n\nMoon Orchid, whose name alludes to her insubstantial presence, has\nlived comfortably in Hong Kong on the subsidy from her husband.\n\n\nThrough the manipulation of Brave Orchid, Moon Orchid is forced to\ncome to America to collect her lost husband and claim her title of first\nwife.\n\n\nAfter she discovers her thoroughly Americanized husband, a successful\ndoctor who has remarried, to an English-speaking wife, Moon Orchid 's old\nChinese life based on an illusion of changeless stability is shattered.\n\n\nBecoming paranoid and morbidly afraid of change, Moon Orchid\nrepeatedly claims that she is being followed by foreign \" ghosts.\n\n\n&rdquo; She is finally sent to a mental asylum, where she dies. \n\n \n\nBy telling Moon Orchid 's story, however, the narrator creates a\nvoice for this oppressed woman from the East.\n\n\nBrave Orchid diagnoses Moon Orchid 's mental disorder as stemming\nfrom her misplaced spirit.\n\n\nBy recording her aunt 's disintegration, Maxine gives Moon Orchid a\nplace in her \" \" mother book &rdquo; \" and appeases\nthe aunt 's spirit.\n\n\nShe even transforms the mental hospital into a quasi-utopian\ncommunity of women.\n\n\nFor the failing Moon Orchid her stay in the mental institution\nparadoxically brings her needed stability and a temporary place to anchor her\nspirit.\n\n\nShe also finds acceptance from her \" daughters, &rdquo;\npsychiatric patients of different races, and therefore is able to talk\n \" a new story &rdquo;  about perfect communication\ninstead of the other old one of persecution. \n\n \n\n\" \" A Song for a Barbarian Reed Pipe, &rdquo;\n\" the last section of \" The Woman Warrior \" , in\nwhich Maxine recalls her struggle with a personal voice from kindergarten to\nthe narrative present:   \" My silence was thickest total\nduring the three years that I covered my school paintings with black paint\n&rdquo;   Maxine writes.\n\n\nThe blackness of her paintings is not a sign of mental disturbance,\nas her American teachers have assumed:   \" I was making a\nstage curtain, it was the moment before the curtain parted and rose, &rdquo;\n  the adult Maxine explains.\n\n\nOnce the curtain is up, there is   \" sunlight\nunderneath, mighty operas. &rdquo;  \n\n\nThis transformation of blackness provides an excellent metaphor for\nthe novel.\n\n\nThe psychodrama of young Maxine 's linguistic struggle is concretely\nenacted in an incident that takes place when she is in the sixth grade.\n\n\nOne day young Maxine confronts and physically attacks a quiet Chinese\nAmerican girl, admittedly her double, in a basement bathroom after school.\n\n\nBut only   \" sobs, chokes, noises that were almost\nwords &rdquo;   come out of the girl, never a comprehensible\nword.\n\n\n  \" If you don't talk, you can't have a personality,\n&rdquo;   Maxine shouts ( to herself as well as to the other\ngirl).\n\n\nMaxine 's sadistic cruelty signifies her own inner trauma of\ninarticulateness.\n\n\nAfter this underground encounter, Maxine spends eighteen months in\nbed  \" with a mysterious illness &rdquo;  and the quiet\ngirl lives under the protection of her family for the rest of her life.\n\n\nAfter years of silence the teenager Maxine finds an angry voice in a\nconfrontation with her mother.\n\n\nBefore this showdown Maxine has tried unsuccessfully to confess to\nthe two-hundred-odd offenses that she has committed in her young life, such\nas tormenting the silent girl and stealing from the cash register at the\nfamily laundry.\n\n\n <quote   > \" If only I could let my mother know the\nlist, &rdquo;  Maxine thought,  \" she and the world would\nbecome more like me, and I would never be alone again. &rdquo;  \n\n\n\nYet the mother puts a stop to Maxine 's attempt at communication, and\nthe pain of silence finally drives Maxine to shout out her defiance of\nChinese misogynism and her desire to leave home.\n\n\nThis triumphant voicing, however, is immediately under the narrator 's\nsorrowful reflection as an older and wiser person:    \"\nBe careful what you say.\n\n\nIt comes true.\n\n\nIt comes true.\n\n\nI had to leave home in order to see the world logically, logic the\nnew way of seeing.\n\n\nI learned to think that mysteries are for explanation.\n\n\nI enjoy the simplicity.\n\n\nConcrete pours out of my mouth to cover the forests with freeways\nand sidewalks.\n\n\nGive me plastic, periodical tables, t.v. dinner with vegetables no\nmore complex than peas mixed with diced carrots.\n\n\nShine floodlights into dark corners: no ghost. &rdquo; \n \n\n\nHer ghost-free new life is based on a rootless sterility represented\nby the concrete and plastic culture.\n\n\nShe has escaped the Chinese interdiction of female speech at the\nexpense of a maternal inheritance of rich imagination.\n\n\nIt takes years for Maxine to come to her right artistic voice. \n\n \n\nAt the end of \" The Woman Warrior \" , Maxine\nfinished her story of development with a return to her matrilineal age.\n\n\nThis reconnection is mediated through that talk story.\n\n\nThe daughter continues the story that her mother has started \n \" The beginning is hers, the ending, mine &rdquo;  \ntelling about T 'sai Yen, a poet who had been abducted by a nomadic tribe,\nhad two children with the barbarian chieftain, and later was ransomed back to\nChina.\n\n\nT 'sai Yen brought her song, \" \" Eighteen Stanzas for a\nBarbarian Reed Pipe, &rdquo; \" back, and it  \"\ntranslated well. &rdquo; \n\n\nFor Maxine, T 'sai Yen is an emblem of the artist  par\nexcellence  , whose poetic power is capable of transforming a\nweapon, the whistling arrow, into a musical instrument.\n\n\nLike the transformed swordswoman in \" \" White Tiger,\n&rdquo; \" T 'sai Yen is a word warrior who serves as a model for the\nauthor of \" The Woman Warrior \" .\n\n\nThus, the interpenetrating stories in \" The Woman Warrior\n\" provide a link between Kingston 's past and present.\n\n\nThe central metaphor of the book is a Chinese knot in which various\nstrands are interwoven into a work of folk art.\n\n\nMaxine, as  \" an outlaw knot-maker, &rdquo; \nweaves the past and the present together into an intricate pattern to create\nher \" \" mother book. &rdquo; \"\n\n\nBy talking stories she successfully builds a matrilineal age to\ncounterpoint the traditional Chinese patrilineage and unmuffles a personal\nyet rooted voice for herself. \n\n \n\nMaxine succeeds in her revenge by reporting the crimes of sexism\nand racism.\n\n\nDespite her diminutive physical stature, she deserves the title of a\n\" word warrior \" in every sense.\n\n\nMaxine 's literary innovations are also significant contributions to\nAmerican literature. \n\n \n\nMoreover, Maxine 's use of a narrator in \" The Woman\nWarrior \" shows an odd mixture of American and Chinese styles.\n\n\nMaxine 's habit of writing from different perspectives and jumping\nback and forth between viewpoints in a way confused us.\n\n\nA knowledge of the difference between American and Chinese views of\nthe self does much to clarify her habit of jumping back and forth between the\npoint of view of such characters as the No Name Woman, Brave Orchid, Moon\nOrchid, Fa Mu Lan, and the protagonist herself.\n\n\nShe used the term \" \" I &rdquo; \" in parts of\nher novel, probably in an attempt to keep the story grounded and to\nincorporate her American style into the story.\n\n\nMuch of the novel, however, is comprised of the stories of others,\nand it is not until the end of these stories that the protagonist includes\nher own opinions.\n\n\nFor the most part, the protagonist gives credit for these stories to\nothers ( her mother in particular), only vaguely hinting that some of the\nideas may be her own.\n\n\nIn this way, the protagonist seems to define herself in terms of\nother people.\n\n\nIt is only at the end of the novel, in the very last section, that\nthe protagonist really speaks for herself and tells her own story.\n\n\nThis storytelling method reflects the Chinese idea that the self\ncomes second to the whole, but the story is a memoir meant to relate\nexperiences of the author herself.\n\n\nBy writing about herself, she goes against the Chinese ideal of\nself.\n\n\nHer use of a narrator thus shows an attempt to bridge the paradox\nbetween American and Chinese writing.  ...", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "45256ca8-4098-478c-9663-5b629b952281", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.106814+00:00"}
{"text": "THE EFFECTS OF e-HR ON EMPLOYEES ' ATTITUDES ACCORDING TO\nGENDER, TENURE AND POSITION  \n\n\n Aimee Antoinette A. Vera Cruz \n\n\n  I. Introduction  \n\n \n\n \" Change doesn't necessarily assure progress, but\nprogress implacably requires change\"  stated Henry Steel Commager.\n\n\nTruly our society had undergone a lot of changes beginning from the\nfirst wave, better known as the Stone Age, when man used tools for survival.\n\n\nThese tools were modified until man reached the second wave.\n\n\nThis era is commonly called the \" Industrial Revolution\n\" wherein people during this time witnessed the growth of factories\nsince machines were applied in the industries.\n\n\nToday, we are in the Electronic Generation, the third wave, an epoch\nwhere technological development of every kind have been so rapid that we had\nto accept more changes within our lifetime than once were spread over many\ngenerations.\n\n\nInformation Technology has helped to force the pace of change in\nindustry, commerce, government and everyday living.\n\n\nAlmost every organization employs technology, specifically those\nconcerned with transmitting information that speeds up problem solving and\nare designed to make the work of the employee relatively simple.\n\n\nThe Human Resource Management, as a pillar of every company, is one\ndepartment that needs to open its door to the Electronic Generation.\n\n\nThis research would like to present the role that technology plays in\nHuman Resource Management, its effects on the attitudes of employees and why\nit is an integral part of an industry who wants to become locally and\nglobally competitive in the years to come.   II.  Conceptual\nFramework      Statement of the Problem \n\n\n \n\nThe study aims to find the effects of different e-HR technologies\non the attitudes of employees according to gender, tenure and position.\n\n\nThe following questions were also raised to facilitate the further\nstudy:\n\n\n1. What are the different e-HR technologies being used by the\ncompany?\n\n\n2. What are the attitudes towards e-HR technologies of employees\naccording to:\n\n\na. gender\n\n\nb. position\n\n\nc. tenure\n\n\n3. Is there a significant difference in attitudes of employees\naccording to gender, tenure and position towards e-HR technologies? \n\n\n  IV. Review of Related Literature  \n\n \n\nThe futuristic outlook now emerging is that of the world without\nbarriers ( Ohmae, 1995).\n\n\nThe application of the latest technology to all areas of society\nparticularly in the business sector opens the doors to many other ways that\nwill make the job relatively simple.\n\n\nThe Human Resource Management is now trying to be updated and\nadvanced in order to give better services to the organization by being\non-line on what 's happening in the world. \n\n \n\nToday the new technology has changed the functions of \"\nHuman Resources \" , starting from a self-service function to a more\ncomplex one.\n\n\nWith the acquisition of the latest technology they can focus more on\nplanning and coaching of managers and employees.\n\n\nThe different companies can now have training complete with sound,\ngraphics and full motion video - just by plugging on to your PC and the\ninstructions are readily available, in which it expands the scope of training\nthat the trainees can fully understand.\n\n\nTechnologies also allow the HR practitioners to increase their level\nof accessibility.\n\n\nFrom traditional approach to component-based approach, from manual to\ncomputers, these changes have significant impact on the role of \"\nHuman Resources \" to the organization.\n\n\nAccording to Aho ( 1989) some influences that cause jobs to change\nrapidly are the product life, technological advances, specialization and\norganization restructuring, which creates challenges for managers, Human\nResource Department and the employees as well. \n\n \n\nTechnologies influence all functions of Human Resources\nManagement and employees ' view of it varies, some perceived it with fears\nbut others with optimism.\n\n\nA survey commissioned by a California computer peripherals company\nshowed that 93% of the employees using the computers had no fears about them,\nand 90% of the employees questioned express interest in using computers\nwhether or not their job required it.\n\n\nIn addition, the traditional stereotype about word processing, data\nprocessing and time management being so called \" \" women 's\nwork &rdquo; \" has been challenged.\n\n\nThe number of men and women performing clerical task on computers is\napproximately the same ( Schultz, 1994). \n\n \n\nComputer-aided performance appraisal offers a thorough and\naccurate technique for evaluating competence on some jobs.\n\n\nSome employees favor it because it ensures that their work will be\nevaluated objectively, while others find it stressful and invasion of\nprivacy.\n\n\nThey are constantly aware that their actions are being monitored, and\nthis pressure sometimes leads them to focus more on quantity of output than\non quality ( Grant, Higgins, and Irving, 1988). \n\n \n\nA research done among 91 employees of Internal Revenue Services\nin United States showed that approximately 9% of the employees opposed\ncomputer-aided monitoring for performance appraisal.\n\n\nThis opposition was manifested in low job satisfaction and high\nintention to quit.\n\n\nThe majority of the employees responded more positively to\ncomputer-aided monitoring.\n\n\nThey showed high job satisfaction and low turnover intentions, as\nlong as the objective information obtained through computer-aided monitoring\nwas used to help employees develop and refine their job skills, but not when\ninformation was used to punish them ( Chalykoff and Kochan, 1989). \n\n\n  V. Significance of the Study  \n\n \n\nThis study is important for a number of reasons.\n\n\nAs globalization is transcending the world and becoming a part of\neach business endeavor, there is a need for every organization to cope with\nthe changes that goes with it and be able to be competitive with their\ncounterpart countries in the region.\n\n\nIn the article written by Dr. Maura B. Fonollera of De La Salle\nUniversity, she stated that  \" the HR professionals should\nprepare in terms of tools for globalized interactions &rdquo;  .\n\n\nAutomation of different office systems and procedures and\nintroduction of current instructional technologies are just one of the coping\nmechanism of Human Resource Department with this new trend.\n\n\nWith this study, the HR practitioner would be able to understand the\nimportance of electronic technologies to their organization.\n\n\nThrough this study also, Human Resources Management can find ways of\nhelping their people cope up with their fears of technology and deal with\ntheir negative impression on automation through proper training and\ninformation. \n\n \n\nAside from its theoretical importance, this study can also have\nits practical applicability for Human Resource Department. \n\n\n  VI. Scope of the Study  \n\n \n\nThe study deals only with the description of different\ntechnologies used in the Human Resources Management and its effects on the\nattitudes of employees towards e-HR.\n\n\nThus, study will not discuss the technical aspect of the different\ntechnologies used.\n\n\nThis study would like to further affirm the applicability of the\nresults of previous studies in the Philippine corporate setting.\n\n\nThe respondents mainly compose of employees who have experienced\nre-engineering or automation of their office systems and procedures in Human\nResource Department.\n\n\nFurthermore, the study would like to know the effects of electronic\ntechnologies on the working attitudes of the employees according to their\ngender, tenure and position in the organization.   <subtext 2>\n\n\n\n\n  Perceived Effects of Work-Family Conflicts on Work\nSatisfaction of Married Employees  \n\n\n Marjorie A. Nisperos \n\n \n\nRemarkable changes in the demographic profile of the Filipino\nworkforce such as the increasing numbers of working mothers and both parents\nworking due mainly to economic downturn pose a probable effect on how married\nemployees handle multiple roles.\n\n\nThese changes invoked varying effects on the traditional Filipino\nfamily system in which the female parents usually stay at home, do household\nworks, care for the children and manage the overall family welfare.\n\n\nWith the current trend in which both parents are obliged to work,\nthere 's increased likelihood that both genders have substantial household\nresponsibilities in addition to work ( Bond, Galinsky, Swanberg, 1998;\nGilbert, Hallet, Eldridge, 1999).\n\n\nHousehold work therefore would be divided for both parents.\n\n\nThus, the issue of balancing work and family emerged. \n\n \n\nThere have been a growing body of research focusing on the\ncauses, consequences and effects of the conflict that arise between work and\nfamily roles ( Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985; Kossek & Ozeki, 1998; Kelloway,\n1999).\n\n\nMost of such research work built on the assumption that conflicting\nrole pressures between work and family became incompatible so that the\nparticipation in one role is made difficult by virtue of participating in the\nother ( Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985).\n\n\nIn addition, most research materials are based on Western culture,\nwhich were first introduced around mid 1980 's.\n\n\nThe concern for work-life balance has only been introduced in Europe\nand US in 1990 's.\n\n\nThe concept therefore is relatively new especially in the Philippine\nsetting where only few research initiatives has been done ( Ayala Foundation,\nECOP, 2001). \n\n \n\nThis study attempts to determine the perceived effects of\nwork-life conflict on the work satisfaction of married employees in a\nFilipino organization.\n\n\nIt is mainly anchored on Filipino family system ( focus on family\ninterfering with work rather than work interfering with family) which assumed\nthat Filipinos value their family first more than their work or career.\n\n\nResearch efforts was also directed in assessing if there 's a\ndifference in the perceived effects of WFC between married female and male\nemployees in relation to the notion of traditional gender roles which placed\ngreater responsibility on the female parent for family welfare. \n\n\n  Review of Related Literature  \n\n\n  Work-Family Conflict  \n\n \n\nThe major trigger for work-family conflict research initiatives\nis the change in workforce demography - more specifically, the influx of\nwomen in the workforce.\n\n\nThis can be attributed to social and economic factors affecting an\nindividual 's role.\n\n\nOver the past two decades, the growing number of research focus on\nthe recognition that work and family are not completely separate domains of\nlife ( Piotrkowski, 1979; Strains, 1980).\n\n\nThis is in contrast with the myth of separate worlds ( Kanter, 1977)\nand segmentation hypothesis ( Dubin, 1973) which views work and family as two\ndifferent spheres. \n\n \n\nOne of the earliest research work of the foundation of\nwork-family conflict was done by Greenhaus and Beutell ( 1985) which defined\nwork and family conflict as a form of interrole conflict that emerges\nwhenever the demands of one role make it difficult to fulfill the requirement\nof another.\n\n\nTheir work also includes the classification of work-family conflict\naccording to time-based, strain based and activity based. \n\n \n\nIn addition, early research treated work-family conflict as\nmainly unidirectional construct but recent research ( Frone, Russel & Cooper,\n1992) implies that it is \" reciprocal &rdquo; in nature.\n\n\nWork can interfere with family ( WIF) and family can interfere in\nwork ( FIW).\n\n\nBoth are distinct constructs ( Driscoll & Ilgen, 1992) but related.\n\n\nResults indicates that work interfering with family is correlated\nwith job dissatisfaction, job burn-out, turnover, depression and life\ndissatisfaction and marital dissatisfaction ( Thomas & Ganster, 1995; Adams,\nKing & King, 1996; Netemeyer, Boles & McMurrain, 1996).\n\n\nFew works have really been focused to analyzing how family conflict\ncan interfere with work.\n\n\nExample of this is the study done by Kelloway ( 1998) based on\nsix-month longitudinal survey data suggested that strain-based Family\nInterfering with Work ( FIW) is a pre-cursor to both stress and turnover\nintentions while strain-based Work Interfering with Family ( WIF) emerge only\nas an outcome of stress.\n\n\nThis suggests that FIW can give a more accurate picture on how role\nconflict affect individuals.\n\n\nAlthough measures of WIF and FIW are strongly correlated ( Frone,\n et al.  , 1992; Gutek  et al.  ,\n1991), individuals typically report more WIF than FIW, possibly because work\ndemands are easier to quantify. \n\n \n\nMoreover, the works of Frone  et al.  ( 1992)\nreported that FIW was related to both depressive symptomatology and job\ndistress while WIF pose ambiguous results.\n\n\nHowever, works of Gignac  et al.  ( 1996) suggest\nthat WIF predicted job satisfaction while FIW didn't.\n\n\nFuthermore, WIF didn't predict absence from work but FIW offered\nsignificant prediction of absenteeism. \n\n \n\nFor the purpose of this study, sources and nature of conflict\nwill only be focused on one direction, that is FIW.\n\n\nThis will be done in order to establish a clearer linear correlation\nbetween source of conflict ( family) and its perceived effects of work\nsatisfaction.\n\n\nThis will be based on a relatively homogenous sample thereby\nproviding an opportunity to clearly establish assessment of the direction of\nthe relationship and other psychological variable. \n\n \n\nIn addition, this study aims to target how FIW affects work due\nto the nature of the target samples ( Filipino married employees) in relation\nto Filipino family values. \n\n\n  Role Conflict  \n\n \n\nAnother area of concern of this study is to establish the\nrelationship or effects of role ( work-family conflict based) to work\nsatisfaction.\n\n\nIt is assumed that as work-family conflict ( WFC) increases, work\nsatisfaction ( WS) decreases, thereby creating an imbalance.\n\n\nA considerable number of research on WFC suggest that work and\nnon-work ( family roles) roles tends to spillover into one another rather\nthan being two separate aspects of life ( Adams, King & King, 1996; Williams\n& Alliger, 1994).\n\n\nThe \" spillover &rdquo; theory suggests that attitudes and\nbehaviors are posited to carry over from one role to another ( Leiton & Durup\n1996).\n\n\nSpillover can be compared to permeable boundary where roles can\nsomehow blend together and influence one another ( Kabonoff, 1980; Zedeck,\n1990).\n\n\nOther views on roles is the compensation theory where roles are\noften interrelated in a counterbalancing manner ( Burke, 1998).\n\n\nMoreover, another theory related to role - segmentation theory\nassumes that individuals have the capacity to compartmentalize compelling\nrole demands ( Lambert, 1990). \n\n \n\nHart ( 1997) found that job satisfaction and non-work\nsatisfaction made independent contributions to overall life satisfaction, but\nthere was no significant relationship between work experiences and non-work\nsatisfaction, nor between non-work experiences and job satisfaction.\n\n\nThis supports the segmentation theory rather than the spillover\ntheory of role conflict.  ...", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6bcfaabc-0de9-4a5b-ac1d-12a6658ccb39", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.108086+00:00"}

\n\n\n  SPINNING A STORY  \n\n \n\nBy 2015, documented accounts of the impeachment trial and ouster\nof former president Joseph Estrada will have been appended to college history\nbooks, tucked between entries on presidents Fidel Ramos and Gloria Arroyo.\n\n\nLike Arroyo 's story-in-progress, Estrada 's story will form part of\nFilipino narratives of the future, recounted in books and retold by people,\njust as Marcos ' story fifteen years ago is recalled in present-day\nnarratives.\n\n\nBy then, landmark events of 2000 and 2001 will have assumed some\nstable configuration - as historical or journalistic texts and documentary\nphotographs and footages retrievable in libraries.\n\n\nErap, too, as a figure in Philippine political history, will be\nconfigured and viewed in such forms. \n\n \n\nThis paper concerns itself not so much with the telling of such\nstable histories as with the more amorphous discourse of storytelling.\n\n\nIt looks at Erap not as a figure in some historical text, but as a\ncharacter in homespun stories that Filipinos may tell now and in the future.\n\n\n \n\nAs with folk narratives in the past, stories, especially as oral\ndiscourse, take on several versions.\n\n\nAs a recollection, each Erap story regarding his impeachment trial\nand EDSA II is bound to assume a different slant, a different mode of\nstorytelling.\n\n\nYet, being anchored on history, such divergent versions ultimately\nyield commonalities, particularly in terms of events, personages, and\nlocations - elements which, correspondingly, fictionists call plot,\ncharacter, and setting.\n\n\nIt is in this sense then, of Erap 's history being transfigured into\nflexible narratives, that this paper seeks to address the subject \"\n\" Erap and the Concept of   Bida   . &rdquo;\n\"\n\n\nSpecifically, in the EDSA II story, is there a   bida\n  ?\n\n\nIs Erap that   bida   ?

\n\n \n\nPhilippine politics has a way of lodging itself into the realm of\nsigns, such that objects and events take on layers of meaning.\n\n\nErap 's fall from the stage, for instance, is not only an event but\nalso a sign ( an omen, a metaphor) for his fall from power.\n\n\nLikewise, the stage from which he falls is not just a physical\nplatform, but also a metaphor for a cultural space: Philippine politics is a\nstage for public performance.\n\n\nFurthermore, in Philippine politics a sign may also assume the nature\nof metonymy, whereby a famous or infamous public figure is called to mind\nthrough a substitute verbal, hand, or visual code that sometimes appears to\nhave little or no real connection to the figure 's name (  e.g.\n , \" Brenda \" , for a  \"\nbrain-damaged &rdquo;  lady senator). \n\n \n\nHeroes in any popular exercise, be it an election, movement or\nuprising, rise to the level of signs; that is, the overriding, central figure\nis  \" semiologically dominant, &rdquo;  one whose\nidentity is summoned into the popular consciousness through a host of\nsignifiers ( a moniker, symbol, color code, or any other identifying marks)\nwidely current in use.\n\n\nCommunities do not ascribe and constantly use an identifying sign to\nrefer to an unknown individual; hence, being identified by the public through\nsigns is a mark of popularity.\n\n\nThe extent of its use also indicates the degree of popularity ( in\nboth the positive and negative senses of the word).\n\n\nIn this case, a sign is widely and unambiguously understood by its\nusers.\n\n\nAlthough, as Saussure theorizes, a signifier and signified have an\narbitrary connection ( Selden 1985) [ Barthes says that the  \"\narbitrary nature of the linguistic sign receives a purely cultural motivation\nin the mythological system &rdquo;  ( Rabate 1994)] and generally a\nsingle signifier may have more than one referent, as used in reference to\npopular heroes a particular signifier, by convention, points unmistakably to\na single person or group.\n\n\nA sign, furthermore, elicits immediate recall. \n\n \n\nThis phenomenon admits of a communal adoption of signs or of a\ncommunal assimilation of what may have been, originally, individually\ndetermined signs (  e.g.  , \" \" Cory yellow\n&rdquo; \" from Ninoy Aquino 's borrowing of \" \" Tie a\nyellow ribbon... &rdquo; \" ) .\n\n\nTaken in relation to Barthes ' notion of  \" cultural\nrevision &rdquo;  ( appropriation of associated meaning), EDSA I, for\ninstance, may also be seen as a pretext of the EDSA II \" \"\ntext, &rdquo; \" in terms of signs and motifs.\n\n\nIn this case, EDSA I provides one the template with which to make\nsense out of the myriad elements of EDSA II.\n\n\nAlready, the whole phenomenon of EDSA has built-in meanings (\nincluding the notion of nonviolence and mass protest along Epifanio de los\nSantos Avenue), for it has risen to the level of myth ( in the Barthesian\nsense). \n\n \n\nThe meanings of signs are socially determined or\nconventionalized, as evinced in the following glimpses of EDSA II.\n\n\nConversely, such signs provide glimpses into the mentalities or\nconstructs at work in the society in which they operate. \n\n \n\nBegun in March 5, 2000, the Silent Protest Movement was signified\nby \" \"  !  \" \"\n\n\nThe group wearing stickers with the slanted exclamation point was\n \" the first middle-class oriented drive for the ouster of then\nPresident Joseph Estrada, &rdquo;  says Contreras in the \"\n Philippine Daily Inquirer  \" , 5 March 2001.\n\n\nThis laid the groundwork for a nonverbal grammar of dissent. \n\n \n\nOn January 29, 2001, Estrada supporters gathered in front of the\nSupreme Court to question  \" the legitimacy of the nine-day old\npresidency of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, &rdquo;  waving posters with\noversized question marks.\n\n\nSimilarly, their foreheads bore \" \" ? &rdquo;\n\" stickers. \n\n \n\nClearly such signs are not only containers of human or object\nreferents; they are also \" \" comment bearers, &rdquo;\n\" if not ideological markers.\n\n\nEven at the incipient stages, the collective use ( as well as nonuse)\nof signs constructs notions of social identity; signs become the means for\none to identify - and identify with - a public figure.\n\n\nAs a result, signs become sociopolitical forces to contend with:\nsigns divide society ( Saussure 's relations of difference), even as these\nunify their respective users. \n\n\n  STREET SIGNS  \n\n \n\nThe 16 January 2001  Philippine Star  photo of St.\nScholastica students flashing the \" \" thumbs down &rdquo;\n\" sign illustrates part of EDSA II semaphores, which signal action,\napart from fostering identity and identification.\n\n\nIt parallels  \" Erap resign,\"  suggesting\n \" Down with Erap! &rdquo; \n\n\nIt is a distant counterpart of the \" \" L &rdquo;\n\" sign used in EDSA I. \n\n \n\nIn terms of color codes, EDSA II enshrined black to signify\n  ang pagkamatay ng demokrasya   , as recorded in\n\" \" An inside look at people power II, &rdquo; \" an\naccount of two Robinson 's Galleria Suites hotel employees that was published\nin the leisure section of the  Philippine Star  , 21 February 2001 (\nin EDSA I, it was \" \" Cory yellow &rdquo; \" ) . \n\n\n \n\n \" [ When] the first [ elevator]...opened, the poor\nGringo was \" greeted &rdquo; by more rallyists, all dressed in black!\"\n  \n\n \n\nGiven the mass ( or mob, depending on whose side one is) nature\nof the EDSA People Power phenomenon, the widespread, frequent use of signs\nbecomes a requisite to communal identity, cohesiveness and, in the end,\npolitical triumph. \n\n\n  ANNOUNCING AN UPRISING  \n\n \n\nDuring EDSA I, a nonstop anti-Marcos information program was\naired through \" Radio  Bandido  \" , the\nclandestine broadcast of June Keithley emanating from a defunct radio\nstation.\n\n\nIts station jingle \" \" Mambo, Mambo,  Mabuhay\n , &rdquo; \" was lifted from the dated \" \"\nMambo, Mambo, Magsaysay, &rdquo; \" with its cautionary line \n\" our democracy will die  kung  wala si Magsaysay \n .\"  \n\n \n\nFor EDSA II, \" Radio  Bandido \n\" morphed into widespead cellphone texting and electronic mail,\napart from legitimate radio and television newscasts that enjoyed freedom\nfrom government surveillance and censorship.\n\n\n( Today, \" Radio  Bandido  \"\nbroadcasts through Dz RJ 810 AM   \" Ito...ang boses mo!\n&rdquo;  \n\n\nIt invites listeners to  \" phone in your opinion\"\n on current issues.\n\n\nFor instance,  \" Do you want to see Erap jailed or not?\"\n (  Philippine Star  , 21 February 2001). \n\n \n\nOne previously apathetic student explained what had moved her to\njoin EDSA II while she was surfing the Net,  \" all of a sudden\nshe realized that the world was 'chatting about Edsa' &rdquo;  (\nSaplala 2001).\n\n\nIndeed, information technology, specifically electronic mail and\ncellphones, has tremendously accelerated the transmission of \"\nrevolutionary &rdquo; signs, as in the cryptic \"  \" Edsa\nna! &rdquo;  \" \n\n \n\n\"  \" Edsa na! &rdquo;  \"\nis an abbreviated call to action, which by its brevity proves that the term\n\" \" EDSA &rdquo; \" itself has assumed the nature of\nsign with built-in messages (  i.e.  , in the last fifteen\nyears, the term has acquired meanings much more than just \" Epifanio\nde los Santos Avenue \" ) .\n\n\nThis sign, moreover, has gained a more specific grounding, given the\nmotifs of setting, plot, and character that have emerged as a result of these\nrepeating revolutions.  ...", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6f7c46f4-727f-4102-8041-ac81413eb766", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.109388+00:00"}
{"text": "THE LINGO OF SHOWBIZ, THE TALK OF STARS: AN ANALYSIS OF THE\nLANGUAGE OF  PINOY  MOVIE MAGAZINES  \n\n\nBy Paul Henson and Kathrine Tan\n\n\n  I. Background  \n\n \n\nIt is safe to say that movie magazines are, in themselves, part of\nthe culture of Philippine society.\n\n\nOne cannot call it an isolated minority as a cultural phenomenon as it\noccupies a steady place in the lives of the ordinary Filipino just as the\nsoap operas,  komiks  , radio drama serials, and Tagalog\nromance novels do.\n\n\nMovie magazines persist and will remain to do so for as long as the\nlocal film industry, with much the same strong following as these\npublications, continue to churn out movies intended for the masses.\n\n\nBut why study popular culture?\n\n\nIsagani R. Cruz ( 1979) provides a simple answer which encapsulates\nthe reason in its entirety.\n\n\nTo the question  \" Why study popular culture? &rdquo;\n -\n\n \n\n \" Because it is there. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Such an answer may seem flippant, but in fact,\nit is precise.\n\n\nThe serious academic scholar studies popular culture because it is\nhis business to study reality, and popular culture forms a large part of\nsocial, intellectual, and artistic reality. &rdquo;   \n\n \n\nAdded to this,  \" The sociologist...[and\nconsequently the sociolinguist] sees popular culture as a social phenomenon,\ncapable of being studied with standard sociological tools &rdquo;  (\n1979). \n\n \n\nThe language of the movie magazines shall prove to be a most\ninteresting point of study as its conventions would speak, to some extent, of\nthe language itself, of what could be termed a \" \"\nsociocultural network &rdquo; \" : the readers, the writers, the\nentertainment industry. \n\n \n\nAt a period wherein the Filipino language is undergoing serious\ndevelopment, the examination of the language of movie magazines may prove\nimportant for it remains to be a language domain ( though not a controlling\none).\n\n\nAs such, by identifying its state, one could bridge it with the other\ndomains so that Filipino could finally fulfill its purpose of being the\nsymbol of national unity. \n\n\n  II. Scope of the Study  \n\n \n\nThis study is centered on the weekly published, Filipino language\nmovie magazines that cater to the C, D crowd.\n\n\nIt is focused mainly on the movie columns because these would have,\nmore or less, already developed a distinct writing style as compared to the\nfeature articles which are basically reportive.\n\n\nAttention is given to the formation of words ( morphology) and the\nway words are put together to form sentences ( syntax).\n\n\nThe study of semantics and styles of speech were purposely omitted\nsince they are subjective and more of evaluative, and would therefore,\nrequire a lengthier discussion.\n\n\nThe purpose of this study is not to provide statistical data but\nmerely to provide a grasp of the culture of movie magazines in general. \n\n\n  Significance of the Study  \n\n \n\nThe study takes to the writers and readers of the local movie\nmagazines as users of the Filipino language.\n\n\nFor a long time now, the intellectualization of the national language\nhas been ( and remains to be) a big concern.\n\n\nAnd such is basically in response to the needs of the controlling\ndomains of language in our society,  \" that is, the domains that\ndictate what language to learn and aspire for ... those of government\nadministration, legislation, judiciary and law, business, commerce, industry,\nscience and technology, the professions, media and education &rdquo; \n( Sibayan, 1991: p. 214). \n\n \n\nBut what about the language needs of the ordinary Filipino?\n\n\nSibayan ( 1991: p. 243) himself acknowledges the significance of a\nmass based language: \n\n\n \" A language may be intellectually modernized but if\nit is possessed by only a tiny upper elite and has no mass base that\npossesses a PM [ popularly modernized] version from which to draw future IM [\nintellectually modernized] users, it will die. &rdquo;   \n\n \n\nThus, with the movie magazines as reflections of a mass-based\nFilipino, the study aims to bring to awareness the state and possibly, the\nneeds, of a national language relating to the masses. \n\n\n  IV. Methodology  \n\n \n\nThe data that were analyzed for this study were obtained from 10\ndifferent weekly published Filipino movie magazines.\n\n\nThe magazines were collected for a specific period of time, that is,\nbetween the last week of February to the first week of March, 1997.\n\n\nThe following is the listing of the magazines:\n\n\n Artista  Magazine. March 3, 1997.\n\n\n ChikaChika  . March 2, 1997.\n\n\nControversial Magazine. February 28, 1997.\n\n\nFame Movie Magazine. March 7, 1997.\n\n\nFlash. March 6, 1997.\n\n\nIntrigue. March 6, 1997.\n\n\n Kislap  . March 3, 1997.\n\n\nMoviestar. February 26, 1997.\n\n\nStar Talk Movie Teen Magazine. March 7, 1997.\n\n\nSuper Teen Movie Magazine. March 2, 1997. \n\n \n\nThe columns were read and analyzed on the following questions:\n\n\n A. Morphology \n\n\na. How are words formed?\n\n\nb. What sociolinguistic concepts/grammatical rules are employed in\nthe creation of words unique to movie magazines?\n\n\nc. What processes are involved in the creation of slang words?\n\n\n B. Syntax \n\n\na. How are sentences structured in movie magazines?\n\n\nb. What grammatical conventions are used?\n\n\nEnglish or Filipino?\n\n\nc. Do they form grammatically correct sentences?\n\n\nd. Explain the process of code switching and borrowing.\n\n\nWhat purpose do these serve?\n\n \n\nInstances of recurring conventions were taken note of and\nanalyzed for patterns. \n\n\n  V. Findings and Results  \n\n\n  A. Morphology  \n\n\n 1. Tenses. \n\n\nAccording to Consuelo J. Paz ( 1995: p. 14),  \n\n \n\nThis is very manifest in the morphology of movie magazines.\n\n\nWhat is strikingly noticeable however is the manner ( and rampancy)\nin which English borrowings are subjected to rules in Tagalog tenses. \n\n \n\nTagalog words are placed in the past tense by the addition of any\nof the prefixes   nag-   ,   na- \n or   i-   and/or the addition of suffixes\n  an/han   or affixes   um/in \n .\n\n\nNotice how the following borrowings were placed in the past tense:\n \n\n \n\nGenerally, Tagalog words are placed in the present tense by the\naddition of   nag-   ,   na- \n and by the reduplication of the first syllable of the word.\n\n\nOtherwise, affixes   in/um   are added in the\nmiddle.\n\n\nNotice the following borrowings and how they were placed in the\npresent tense:  \n\n \n\nTagalog words are placed in the future tense by the addition of\nprefixes   mag-   ,   ma-  \nor   i-   and by the reduplication of the first\nsyllable of the word.\n\n\nNotice the following borrowings and how they were placed in the\nfuture tense:  \n\n \n\nAt this point, it would be of importance to call to our attention\nthe rules of the Filipino language on the spelling of borrowed words.\n\n\nAccording to the   Surian ng Wikang Pambansa \n ( Edroza-Matute,  et al.  , 1987: p. 8) ( 1987:\np. 10): \n\n\nTake note that the second rule provides that the borrowed word must\nbe new to the Filipino vocabulary, and presumably, with no Filipino\nequivalent.\n\n\nIt is interesting to note, however, that a lot of the words mentioned\nabove have Filipino equivalents such as \" \" deny &rdquo;\n\" ( Tagalog   tanggi   ) , \" \"\nentertain &rdquo; \" ( Tagalog   aliw   ) ,\n\" \" stay &rdquo; \" ( Tagalog   manatili\n  ) , \" \" guest &rdquo; \" ( Tagalog\n  panauhin   ) , \" \" thank you &rdquo;\n\" ( Tagalog   salamat   ) , \"\n\" claim &rdquo; \" ( Tagalog   ariin   )\n, \" \" realize &rdquo; \" ( Tagalog   natanto\n  ) .\n\n\nOne could assume that the reason why the movie magazine writers\nrefuse to use these Filipino equivalents are for reasons of inconvenience,\nformality or frozenness. \n\n \n\nThe second issue that must be addressed is that of the borrowings\nwithout direct Filipino equivalents and the acceptability of them being\nsubjected to Tagalog rules on tenses.\n\n\nSince one could say that these words might still be relatively new to\nthe Filipino vocabulary, the issue of direct spelling ( as per the\nabovementioned rule) is acceptable.\n\n\nBut how about the application of tenses?\n\n\nDoes one consider the morphology of these as \" Taglish &rdquo;\nand inconsistent, with the structure in Tagalog and the vocabulary in\nEnglish?\n\n\nOr is it acceptably Filipino?\n\n\nAccording to Edroza-Matute,  et al.  ( 1987: p.\n22-23) in reference to such a predicament:  \n\n \n\nAs such, a compromise may be acceptable. \n\n\n  2. Nouns, Adjectives  \n\n \n\nThe same observations can be applied to cases wherein an English\nborrowing is paired with Filipino prefixes to create nouns and adjectives.\n\n\nExamples:  \n\n\n  3. English Nouns/Adjectives Functioning as Verbs in\nFilipino  \n\n \n\nAnother interesting observation in the movie magazines is how\nnouns or adjectives in English are made to function as Filipino verbs.\n\n\nExamples:  \n\n \n\nIt must be to the Filipino 's ingenuity that these English nouns\nand adjectives are so easily transformed into verbs, again, owing to the ease\nwith which Filipino affixes can be attached even to borrowed words.\n\n\nObviously, it is easier to say    \"\nMag-parlor ka nga, &rdquo;    rather than \n  \" Pumunta ka nga sa parlor. &rdquo;  \n \n\n\n  4. Tense Mix-Up  \n\n \n\nThere are instances in the movie magazines wherein tenses of\nborrowed words get mixed-up.\n\n\nExamples:  \n\n\n  5. Slang Words   \n\n \n\nSlang words in movie magazines are derived mainly as a product of\ncoinage and loanwords given new meanings.\n\n\nMany of the slang words come from already pre-existing words and get\nreshaped by the addition of affixes, reduction or the cutting-off of some\nsyllables, changes in spelling and contraction.\n\n\nSome of the words retain their original meanings while the others\ncarry on entirely new definitions. \n\n \n\nThe coinages in the movie magazines serve different purposes.\n\n\nSome are used to name, label or brand persons ( example:  \ndyowa   ) .\n\n\nOthers, as adjectives or adverbs, are used to describe the reactions\nof these persons ( example:   deadma   ) .\n\n\nThe rest may serve as interjections, nouns or special affixes. \n\n \n\nForeign words, mostly English, are usually not borrowed as is.\n\n\nThey also go through a process of reshaping and at times, of\nchanging meanings. \n\n \n\nOne very noticeable convention is the use of  \" may\ni- &rdquo;  as a prefix to verbs, even nouns and adjectives, whether\nin English or Filipino.\n\n\nWhen  \" may i- &rdquo;  is added, the word\nautomatically takes the function of a verb, usually in the past tense.\n\n\nIt serves a purpose almost similar to that of   \"\nnag- &rdquo;   .\n\n\nExample:  \n\n \n\nAlso noticeable is how a number of slang words have sexual\nconnotations ( example:   dyug   ,  etc.\n ) .\n\n\nThis phenomenon can be reflective of the kind of movies being shown\nand created in the country, the so-called \" \" Titillating Films\n&rdquo; \" or TF, which cater to the masses, who are consequently,\nalso the readers of these magazines. \n\n \n\nOne could assume that the movie magazines use slang words to\nspice-up their columns and to add humor so that the readers, the masses, are\nkept interested.\n\n\nSlang words have that colloquial character that is presumably\nadaptable to the magazines ' market readers. \n\n \n\nOn Table 1 is the list of slang words which have been obtained\nfrom the movie magazines.\n\n\nAlso included are the manner of derivation and the definition. \n\n\n\n  A. Syntax  \n\n \n\nHere are the sample sentences obtained in the analysis of the\nsyntax of movie magazines.\n\n\nThey have been classified accordingly and have been roughly ranked,\nwith the first type as most frequent, and the last as the least frequent in\noccurrence.\n\n\nBorrowings ( words coming from different languages other than the\nbase language) are indicated by the underscores while code-switchings (\nactivation of two systems) are italicized. \n\n\n1. Sentences with English borrowings \n\n\n2. Sentences with borrowings and code-switching to English (\nFilipino base) \n\n\n3. Sentences with borrowings and code-switching with vague,\nunidentifiable language pattern \n\n\n4. Others\n\n\na. Sentences with unnecessary English borrowings \n\n\nb. Sentences with Filipino borrowings \n\n\nc. Sentences with borrowing and code-switching to Filipino ( English\nbase)  \n\n \n\nThe local movie magazines are essentially in Filipino most\nlikely owing to the market to which they cater to.\n\n\nTherefore, one would expect that when borrowings occur, there is\nalmost always a functional purpose to it.\n\n\nSentences with English borrowings are the most frequent.\n\n\nWriters borrow English nouns, adjectives and verbs when there is no\ndirect Filipino equivalent ( example: playlist); or if there is a Filipino\nequivalent, the expression would remain to be more explicit if said in\nEnglish; otherwise, it is done for purposes of convenience as the Filipino\nequivalent might be too lengthy or not very colloquial in sound ( example:\n\" sex workers &rdquo;  vis a vis   \n\" mga nagbebenta ng aliw &rdquo;   ) . \n\n \n\nThe same reasons are also true for code-switching to English for\ncertain phrases or expressions ( example: \" While beating the\ndeadline...\").\n\n\nIn the Type 2 sentences, code-switching is resorted to since no\namount of Filipino translation can match the ease with which the phrase can\nbe expressed in English.\n\n\nThe structure remains to be Filipino, though, since the main thought\nof the sentences are in Filipino, and for the English code-switches, the\nwriter could have very well opted to use the indicated Filipino phrases\ninstead.\n\n\nCode-switchings occur mostly intersententially. \n\n \n\nBro. Andrew Gonzales ( 1992: p. 90) makes the following\nobservation on code-switching:   \" A register has developed\nfor rapport and intimacy that depends on code-switching between Filipino and\nEnglish.\n\n\nIt is largely...used in...certain types of informal writing in\ndaily newspapers and weekly magazines. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nTypes 3 and 4 are basically dependent on who the writer is.\n\n\nThese occur as isolated cases for they are not very well-suited to\nthe market for which these publications are intended. \n\n\n  VI. Analysis and Discussion  \n\n \n\nBonifacio P. Sibayan ( 1991: p. 242) places the status of the\nlanguage of movie magazines in this state:   \" The Filipino\nused in Filipino tabloid newspapers and other publications intended for\npopular consumption is modernized but not intellectualized....\n\n\nThe modernized Filipino of entertainment... and used in daily\nnewspapers and magazines circulated among the people may be called a\npopularly modernized language ( PML). &rdquo;   \n\n \n\nIt may be a popularly modernized language but is nonetheless\nsignificant for a PML, being a mass base for growth and development, takes\nprecedence over intellectual modernization ( 1991: p. 242-243). \n\n \n\nOne might take notice that movie magazines have a distinct\nlanguage of their own, but after closer examination, most of it ( specially\nthe morphology, borrowing and code-switching) is really no different from the\nway residents of Metro Manila speak.\n\n\nPurists might say that movie magazine morphology is not the kind of\nFilipino that is intended to be taught and spread.\n\n\nNonetheless, it is accepted because it facilitates communication -\nthe people know, understand and speak it themselves.\n\n\nThe same holds true for code-switching.\n\n\nBut the researchers maintain that there should be a functional\npurpose to code-switching, otherwise, it should be limited if not eliminated.\n\n\n \n\nAnother issue that must be looked into is that of borrowing.\n\n\nConsuelo J. Paz ( 1995: p. 28) sees borrowing as a natural\nphenomenon to any living language with contact to outside cultures.\n\n\nIt is a way of enriching the borrowing language and must not be seen\nas a lowering of its standards.\n\n\nBut Paz ( p. 32) adds that one of the results of this is the\nemergence of competing words or synonyms, as is the case with some of the\nborrowings in the movie magazines which have direct Filipino equivalents.\n\n\nBut as per the provision by the   Surian ng Wikang\nPambansa   , borrowing is acceptable if the term is not yet\nwidespread in the Filipino vocabulary.\n\n\nThe concern then would be the standardization of spelling ( and this\nwould definitely take time).\n\n\nPaz ( p. 57-58) says that the decision of changing the spelling to\nsuit the Filipino orthography is a problem to be solved by the translator.\n\n\nThe problem of spelling it as \" \" shooting &rdquo;\n\" or \"  \" syuting &rdquo;  \"\nwould probably be determined by whether or not the borrowing has already been\naccustomed to Filipino, thus the ease of standardizing it by adapting it to\nFilipino orthography.  ...", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "0d4d9d15-4429-47a6-baf6-8f81da473ce0", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.111156+00:00"}
{"text": "SOCIOLOGY and the Red Violin \n\n\nby Wainright Gregory S. Yu\n\n \n\nFirst of all, what is the red violin?\n\n\nThe violin was born in France, lived through its youth in a monastery,\ntaken by a young musical miracle from thence to fair Verona, crossed\nthousands of miles, climbed high mountains, and sailed through vast seas and\noceans to reach Asia and the New World.\n\n\nNow, this infamous blood-coated violin is in the hands of an\nAfrican-American living in New York.\n\n\nWhat great importance does this musical artifact bare that it was\ntreasured by all its masters and kept in care with costs insignificant?\n\n\nHow is it that many of the great men have tempted their fates by\nchallenging culture, attempting to transcend massive cultural boundaries and\nfound scampering back, while this artifact had traveled to most of the world\nwith wounds that have proved not to be irreparable?\n\n\nHow can it be that the violin had, instead of being affected by the\neffects of culture, reversed the natural way and turned the tables in\ninflicting to that culture the effects of the Red Violin? \n\n \n\nThe violin was originally a European musical instrument.\n\n\nIt then, like many other European cultural influences, diffused to\neven some of the remotest parts of the third world.\n\n\nThe violin is a material component of Europe 's culture.\n\n\nIt is the embodiment of music, the universal nonmaterial aspect, of\nEurope.\n\n\nViolins in general are handcrafted.\n\n\nThis one in particular was especially made.\n\n\nIt was a masterpiece.\n\n\nJudging by that fact, violins are part of high culture mainly due to\ntheir unavailability to the masses because of price.\n\n\nTherefore, in continuity, the violin is a material component of the\nhigh European culture. \n\n \n\nReferring to a single situation in the movie instead of\nexplaining the movie in whole in order to concentrate our efforts within a\nlimited perimeter, we shall take the part of the movie wherein the Red Violin\nhad arrived at Mainland China.\n\n\nIt is evident here that the Chinese are highly unreceptive to foreign\ninfluences that they actually reached the point that they burned these\nforeign ( to be more specific European) artifacts just to openly show their\ndisgust.\n\n\nAs the Chinese woman high official had said,  \" Foreign\nthings are worthless and useless; they are nothing in comparison to what our\nculture has to offer. &rdquo; \n\n\nEthnocentrism is very evident here.\n\n\nThere is even no need to expound more on it being that it is already\nvery obvious.\n\n\nThis ethnocentrism is even taken to the next level when the head\nmilitary woman looked very ready to condemn and even outcast ( and who knows\nwhat more) the man who was found to be in possession of a violin.\n\n\nIt is also equally evident as the value of Love is shown to have less\nbearing in comparison to their ethnocentricity driven nationality when the\nhusband of the woman in possession of the Red Violin reported his own wife to\nthe authorities knowing what the effects of these allegations are.\n\n\nHis wife could have been removed from her high position in the\nmilitary and maybe even worse punishments could have been given to her not\nonly for her possession of these artifacts but also for her deceit in trying\nto hide them being a military woman of her stature.\n\n\nThis just serves as a great portrayal of either their great hatred\nfor the Europeans/foreign culture, jealousy for the high advancement of these\nother countries, or just simply their love for their own nation and culture.\n\n\n \n\nEnough of the one sided conversation, we shall now take it in the\nperspective of the other side.\n\n\nNaturally if there is a pro side there will always be a con side.\n\n\nIn this case, these characters were played by the woman with the Red\nViolin and the man whose violin was burned.\n\n\nThey symbolize the cultural minority and also they embody not only\ntheir state of minority but also their reversal of perspective.\n\n\nThey are not only culturally relative regarding the European culture,\nthe violin in particular, but as shown, they possess a passion and love of\nit.\n\n\nIn a way, a xenocentrism is evident within them.\n\n\nThe only deviation is the fact that the Chinese were never really\ncolonized as a whole at the same point in time, but some of their regions\nhave been colonized; therefore, the term xenocentrism may and may not\ncompletely suit them. \n\n \n\nThe culture of a society defines the who, what, where, when, and\nmore importantly the how of the people within that cultural boundary.\n\n\nIt identifies exactly their society as a whole.\n\n\nThe receptivity in this case varies depending on the people in\nquestion.\n\n\nThe Chinese are highly unreceptive, so are the Japanese.\n\n\nWe Filipinos are the contrast of these countries.\n\n\nWe are highly xenocentric.\n\n\nSome would even say that we are the epitome of xenocentricity.\n\n\nWe are said to be the full embodiment of the colonial mentality.\n\n\nThe United States of America, being a multicultural society, is\nreceptive to the influence of various cultures.\n\n\nThe French are highly anti-African.\n\n\nMost Africans in turn are highly Afrocentric, and the Europeans is\ngeneral are Eurocentric.\n\n\nThis perspective varies, and it may be included as part of the\nsociety 's culture.\n\n\nThis phenomenon was, though not fully but significantly, explained by\nthe Sapir-Whorf theory, a theory that states that a country 's language may\nserve as the \" lenses &rdquo; in which the people of that country see\nthe world.\n\n\nThis serves as minimal explanation why the Japanese and Chinese (\nwhose languages are drastically different from those of the rest of the\nworld, specifically those that are of the west) are highly ethnocentric and\npossess strict norms regarding culture preservation. \n\n \n\nWe then begin to wonder where had all these patterns of\nsociological thinking begun?\n\n\nIf culture is derived from the societies ' practices and various\nbeliefs, norms, and values, then what had started the unending train of\nbelief created after belief, norm derived from another norm, and values\nrevised to create a new but essentially the same value?\n\n\nThis is related to the question we had posed in the beginning of this\nessay.\n\n\nWhy does it seem that the culture had less effect on the Red Violin\nas it had traveled through the various continents than the effect the Red\nViolin had posed on those cultures?\n\n\nIt is evident that as different things come and go passing through\nand out of the cultural boundaries that time had defined so clearly, the\npiece of culture that transcends through these boundaries is not as much\naffected by being in the current culture than the culture is being changed by\nthe presence of that object.\n\n\nObjects have already been created in their permanent form.\n\n\nThe form that they are made into is the same form that they shall\nleave existence as.\n\n\nThese creations of culture or embodiments of culture are but\nrepresentations of culture itself; therefore, it is unchanging.\n\n\nCulture, on the other hand, is dynamic.\n\n\nIt is ever changing.\n\n\nAs time passes, culture changes.\n\n\nThis can be clearly seen in the movie, \" the Red Violin\n\" .\n\n\nWhen the violin was born, it was an instrument found almost only in\nEurope alone, but as time passed, it had been a bit more spread out and in\nsome regions, like China, it was banned.\n\n\nFinally, the present showed that the Red Violin became one of the\nmost coveted artifacts of that time, and ironically, those who had thrown (\nChinese) or given ( the monks) it away were present in the auction lusting\nfor the Red Violin.\n\n\nThey wanted it back so much that they were willing to buy it back at\nauction price ( much more risky and expensive than the retail price).\n\n\nThe violin had changed the culture in which it had traversed.\n\n\nThe monks were forever left with a hope of finding a gifted musician,\ntheir only source of fame or attention from the outside world.\n\n\nThe Chinese were left with the minority group, who would eventually\nrebel for the love of music.\n\n\nThe Europeans were given the title of being the greatest musicians\ndue to the fact that they had created one of the greatest and most famous and\ningenious musical instruments the world had ever seen.\n\n\nTo me all of this is a bit exaggerated, these people seem to take\nthings pretty quickly to the next level, but that 's how society works.\n\n\nThese are the effects of the great interwinding and interdependency\nof the various components of culture to give a result of minor to massive\nchanges to the said culture. \n\n \n\nThe Red Violin is here not just an object of musical art where an\naesthetic emotion can be derived but it has now evidently become a tool of\ncultural diffusion and cultural change.\n\n\nIt has the power of the greatest war machine because it instills men\nand women to be influenced by what is seemingly a harmless object of art but\nwhat can be used to propagate a war, incite a revolt, or for any reason the\ncreator deems necessary.\n\n\nThe Spanish had used religion, specifically Christianity, to put us\ninto chains.\n\n\nThe Americans used education to exploit our resources, and who knows,\nthe Red Violin might have then been used to inspire the musicians to band\ntogether in revolt as the martial artists in China had once formed an\nalliance against the government in the Boxer rebellion. \n\n \n\nCulture is the embodiment of its many small parts.\n\n\nOne of which is the Red Violin.\n\n\nCulture shapes our society into what it is, and culture defines us\nfor who we are and what we stand for.\n\n\nCulture shapes everything we do.\n\n\nSo, wouldn't it be deducible that the violin in its own little\nsignificant way decides who and what the violinists are?\n\n\nNotice that the music played by each using the Red Violin is the\nsame.\n\n\nDoesn't it signify the similarities the violinists have judging by\nthe mere fact that they all play the violin and have a special taste for that\nspecific violin? \n\n \n\nOperating in the same line of thought, we can say that if we\nreplace the violin with some other object of culture, the effects would be\nsimilar?\n\n\nI 'm now using a computer to type this essay and in the same way,\nothers are also typing their reports.\n\n\nThis creates an impalpable link between people.\n\n\nIf the Sapir-Whorf theory stated that language serves as the lens\nthrough which people see the world, then we could also say that the artifacts\nserve as the link through which we see others without the illusion of the\nlens of language for we can relate with another who does not speak our\nlanguage, but by the mere fact that you play the same instrument you have an\nunbreakable link through which communication is possible.\n\n\nMusic is then one way to see the world through the lens of another.\n\n\nIsn't it a wonder how the most insignificant of objects may through\nthe course of its life alter so much?\n\n\nThe Red Violin, at the moment of its death, had lived a greater life\nthan any hero of any country had.\n\n\nIt had instilled changes that even the great conquerors like Napoleon\nBonaparte, Adolf Hitler, Alexander the Great, or Attila the great king of the\nHans could have ever done.\n\n\nThen it can be said that the individuals who had influenced the world\nthe most were not the great conquerors or the great heroes of the nation but\nthe creators whose masterpieces shall live nearly forever and through the\ncourse of its long life, build cities, move capitals, and alter even the most\nethnocentric cultures.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "2747ba59-1e27-4479-a6b6-1b68527ca00a", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.112413+00:00"}

Conferences and\nthe processes involved in the making of such conferences.\n\n\nThe epilogue attempted to rationalize the Church 's rather noxious\ndealings and how these have influenced events before and during the\nconferences. \n\n \n\nThe book was divided into five parts each containing related\nchapters.\n\n\nPart I,  UN Conferences and the Vatican  , had two chapters\nand gave the book its context.\n\n\nChapter 1 gave a brief history of why the UN organizes population and\ndevelopment conferences, while chapter 2 explained how the Vatican engineered\nits way into the UN. \n\n \n\nPart II,  Before Cairo  , was composed of three\nchapters.\n\n\nChapter 3 described what took place in the Preparatory Committee (\nPrepCom) meetings, particularly PrepCom 3, held before the ICPD ( also\nreferred as the Cairo Conference).\n\n\nChapter 4 discussed what happened after PrepCom 3 and angrily\nrecounted how the Catholic Church in the Philippines waged a vehement outcry\nabout the delegates to PrepCom 3, the Cairo Conference itself and the Cairo\ndocument on population and development.\n\n\nChapter 5 described the Church-organized rally before the Cairo\nConference and the agreement forged between the Philippine government and the\nChurch. \n\n \n\nPart  Cairo  , contained three chapters.\n\n\n\nChapter 6 dealt with the start of the Cairo Conference, the major\nplayers in it and what they said in their opening speeches, as well as the\nefforts of various participants from the NGOs to influence the Conference.\n\n\nChapter 7 discussed the key issues and debates among the countries\nrepresented in the Conference, how they negotiated the minute turns of\nphrases and the subtleties of words, how the Vatican derailed the Conference\nthrough its obstinacy, and how the Philippines participated.\n\n\nChapter 8 was reflective since it looked back at the entire unfolding\nof events after the fury and frenzy, and tried to analyze what actually took\nplace. \n\n \n\nPart IV,  Manila  , had three chapters.\n\n\nChapter 9 recounted Pope John Paul II 's second visit to Manila in\nJanuary 1995.\n\n\nChapter 10 focused on the Philippine tetanus toxoid controversy,\nwhich the Church generated.\n\n\nChapter 11 related how Sen. Francisco Tatad 's appointment as chair\nof the Senate committee on women and family relations created a big stir\namong the women in the country. \n\n \n\nPart V,  Beijing  , is the last part of the book and\ncontained four chapters.\n\n\nChapter 12 described the Vatican 's global campaign against the\nFourth World Conference on Women ( the Beijing Conference) in September 1995.\n\n\nChapter 13 recounted how the church and its lay groups in the\nPhilippines took the cue from the Vatican and lambasted the Beijing\nConference, and how the National Commission on the Role of Filipino Women (\nNCRFW), the Catholic sisters, women from the academe and women NGOs, fought\nback.\n\n\nChapter 14 related how the Philippine government and women NGOs\nprepared for the Beijing Conference and how they agreed to work together on\ncertain flagship issues.\n\n\nChapter 15, the final chapter, described the discussions during the\nBeijing Conference and related how Church pressure was again exerted. \n\n\n  Analysis  \n\n\n  Contributions to Gender, Sexuality and Reproductive Health\nand Rights  \n\n \n\nThe book directly dealt with concepts and issues on sexuality,\ngender, reproductive health and reproductive rights, particularly of women.\n\n\nThe author chronicled how these concepts became integrated in\npertinent international conference documents that serve as guidelines for\nindividual state implementation at the national level.\n\n\nThe readers were provided with clarifications and conceptual\ndefinitions, as well as the debates on relevant issues surrounding gender,\nsexuality, reproductive health and reproductive rights.\n\n\nThe author 's reference to actual document paragraphs concretely\ngrounds such concepts and issues by calling to mind that gender, sexuality,\nreproductive health and reproductive rights have ceased to remain in the\nrealm of theory and have become widely recognized as realities that need to\nbe addressed by governments.\n\n\nHence, the book is peppered by issues like violence against women,\nreproductive choices pertaining to fertility control, access to reproductive\nhealth services, male responsibility in fertility management, the rights of\nthe girl child and adolescent reproductive health, among others, as these\nwere part of the key points discussed in the narrated international\nconferences.\n\n\nThe main theme of the book, however, was the Roman Catholic Church 's\nactive involvement in efforts to disrupt the gains of women in the arena of\ninternational recognition of women 's issues or concerns.\n\n\nIn particular, the book lengthily and insightfully discusses how\nreligion, especially Roman Catholicism, becomes a major factor in the\nsuppression of women 's sexuality and reproductive rights.\n\n\nSuch insights touched on the global and local ( Philippine) contexts\nand thus showcased how an inherently \" male &rdquo; institution like\nthe Catholic Church bend over backwards ( like starting the controversy on\nthe tetanus toxoid as an abortifacient) just to maintain a semblance of its\nperceived \" natural &rdquo;  status quo  with\nregards \" women 's roles &rdquo; as wives and mothers. \n\n\n  The Book 's Strengths and Weaknesses  \n\n \n\nOne strength of the book is its provision of historical \nmilieu  for the recent recognition of women 's issues\ninternationally, particularly in the UN, as well as the events that led to\nthe Vatican 's participation in UN Conferences.\n\n\nThus, the readers are provided with chronological account of global\nchanges where women 's issues are concerned, starting from the first\nInternational Conference on Population and Development and the first World\nConference on Women, to the declaration of the Decade of Women ( 1975-1985),\nthe Cairo ICPD and the Beijing Conference.\n\n\nSignificant events that happened in the intervening years were also\nnarrated and all these helped in contextualizing the arguments raised in the\nbook. \n\n \n\nThe author, as pointed out in the foreword written by Rina\nJimenez-David, is not associated with any women 's group or organized\nideological orientation.\n\n\nThis proves to be an advantage since discerning readers cannot fault\nher for propagating certain group agenda and she thus comes off as a genuine\npersonal advocate of women 's health and reproductive rights.\n\n\nHer actual attendance to the conferences described in the book (\nincluding the PrepComs) and academic background as a medical doctor likewise\nlends her added credibility in espousing her ideas and opinions, to those who\nthink such factors like educational attainment, matters.\n\n\nMoreover, the author has a very clear writing style and this served\nher in good stead in terms of communicating her ideas and opinions to the\nreaders.\n\n\nHer display of witticisms throughout the book painted the Catholic\nChurch as hilarious.\n\n\nHer dab at illustrating the logic employed by the Church and its avid\nfollowing ( pp. 55, 63, 134) not only exhibited a perceptive mind but also\nsuccessfully showed the rather skewed associations that run through the\nChurch 's stance. \n\n \n\nThe very same writing style of the author, however, may be the\nsource of weakness of the book, especially in the realm of advocacy work.\n\n\nI would like to personally believe that the book was written more to\npromote the recognition and acceptance of women 's reproductive health and\nrights rather than the personal venting out of a conference insider who may\nhave problems with her religion.\n\n\nAs such, the strong opinions against the Catholic Church evident\nthroughout the book may enlighten some people but may also offend some.\n\n\nThe pointed remarks which I found to be in order and even funny may\nproduce cognitive dissonance to Catholic readers who, prior to reading the\nbook, have never questioned the moral ascendancy of the Church, even in\nmatters pertaining to sexuality and reproductive choices.\n\n\nSo while the likelihood that many lay people may not end up reading\nthe book, the fact that it was published means that it has been circulated\nand the theme and style may have weakened its utility as an advocacy\nmaterial. \n\n \n\nNotwithstanding the perceived weakness of the book, I think that\nits theme and language actually manifest that changes are being made in the\nrealm of gender, sexuality, reproductive health and reproductive rights.\n\n\nThe book 's reference to the obvious resistance of the Catholic\nChurch in the international adoption of certain concepts like different forms\nof families, unwanted pregnancy, unsafe abortion, sexual orientation,\nadolescent reproductive health, among others, indicates that forces are now\nat work to change the prevailing social order.\n\n\nThe Church 's resistance is therefore to be expected and should be\naddressed accordingly.\n\n\nAfter all, the Catholic Church is a bastion of patriarchal ideology,\nwhere justification for women 's subordinate status still stem from the\nrather lame excuse that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was born male and had\nmale disciples. \n\n\n  On the issue of Vatican \" power &rdquo; in the UN\n \n\n \n\nAside from my overall appreciation of the book, I would like to\ntake note of Chapter 2, which I found to be personally intriguing and\nrelevant to the cause of women 's reproductive rights.\n\n\nThe said chapter dealt with technicalities for UN membership and\nobserver status qualifications---things I learned in my undergraduate\ndisciplinal background.\n\n\nWhat I have come to understand in Political Science which I likewise\nteach to my students is the basic definition of a state, and that it consists\nof four basic elements: a defined territory, people, government and\nsovereignty.\n\n\nOnly states become members of the UN and the status of observer is\nconferred to those who do not meet state qualifications, or those with\npeculiar status.\n\n\nAn example of an observer state is Switzerland, which by virtue of\nits being a neutral country, cannot be a full-fledged member of an\norganization that can get involved in wars ( I think Palestine is also an\nobserver since it is still not considered a state because its territorial\nclaim is yet to be settled).\n\n\nIn connection with this, the status of \" permanent observer\n&rdquo; has been accorded to Switzerland in 1946 after it named a permanent\nobserver in the UN and the secretary general accepted the designation.\n\n\nHenceforth, the \" permanent observer &rdquo; status has been\ncustomarily acknowledged, although the UN Charter has no provisions on such\nstatus.\n\n\nIn the case of the Vatican, the Lateran Pacts of 1929 signed by then\nPope Pius XI and Mussolini gave the Pope his little piece of ground, Vatican\nCity, in which he is to be the master.\n\n\nThe said pacts embodied a treaty and agreement between the Pope and\nthe Italian state regarding the control of ecclesiastical matters.\n\n\nThat was how the Vatican became a state although unlike any modern\nstate, the Vatican city-state does not exist to support its citizens.\n\n\nIts main purpose is to serve as the site of the central\nadministration of the Roman Catholic Church, to administer its properties and\nto ensure the ecclesiastical independence of the Holy See ( the Pope 's\ndiocese, which includes not just the Vatican but also Rome).\n\n\nIn 1964, then Pope Paul VI named a \" permanent observer &rdquo;\nto the UN and since the Holy See has been participating in UN Conferences\nsince the 1950s, the UN Secretary General accepted the designation.\n\n\nAll these were narrated in pages 17-18 of the book while in page 19,\nthe recent development of according voting privilege to permanent observers\nwas noted.\n\n\nThus, the Holy See was able to vote in recent conferences.\n\n\nAside from this, the fact that the UN strives to achieve consensus to\navoid relying on votes in the adoption of documents gave the Holy See the\nability not only to vote but also to block consensus.\n\n\nUniversal knowledge on consensus building, as likewise pointed out in\npage 19, allows minority views-even a single one---to have a voice in the\nproceedings.\n\n\nIn line with this, Da&ntilde;guilan narrated in pages 19-21, the\nefforts of certain international networks to petition and lobby for the\nwithdrawal of the permanent observer status of the Holy See on the basis that\nit acts more as a religious body rather than a state, thus promulgating\nreligious viewpoints.\n\n\nAs such, the inappropriateness and negative effects of allowing the\nHoly See to use the UN system to advance the theological positions of the\nCatholic Church has been demonstrated over and over again.\n\n\nPetitions, however, have not been able to drive the Holy See out of\nthe UN.\n\n\nSo while the Pope 's pronouncements and other Catholic publications\nemphasize that the Holy See comes from a spiritual position and therefore\nfinds itself at odds with the secular, political nature of the UN, it still\ncontinues to enjoy being a non-member state permanent observer.\n\n\nQuoting from Da&ntilde;guilan, for how long will the Catholic Church\nhave this privilege, we can only surmise.   \n\n \n\nThe fact that the author touches on such aspect of the\ncontroversies raised by the Church is I think noteworthy and may also be\nregarded as a strength of the book.\n\n\nThe author deftly implied that we should start questioning the\n\" power &rdquo; enjoyed by the Holy See in the UN, and even of our own\nPhilippine Church hierarchy vis-\u00e0-vis governmental decision-making and\npersonal choices made by real women confronted by real circumstances.\n\n\nThus, realizing that the authority of the Pope and the Church on\nmatters pertaining to women 's reproductive health is actually very\nquestionable ( after all, they do not get pregnant), women and even men,\ninspired by knowledge gained from reading books like Da&ntilde;guilan 's,\nshould start to rethink their religious adherence and maybe even start to\nmobilize.\n\n\nWhen this happens, perhaps within this century, about six centuries\nafter the medieval ages, the Roman Catholic Church will begin to veer away\nfrom outdated and unfounded \" dogma &rdquo; and start to \"\nde-bracket &rdquo; women 's issues---not only in documents but in concrete\neveryday circumstances.\n\n\nFor women 's empowerment includes their freedom to make choices\npertaining to their bodies---their sexuality and reproductive health.\n\n\nSuch choices are personal and no institution should impinge on that\nright of choice.\n\n\nSo, while the Virgin Mary serves as the unrealistic model whom the\nChurch endorses for women to emulate, I cannot help but concur with what Rina\nJimenez-David wrote in her newspaper column way back in 1994:  \"\nEven God asked Mary 's permission before He got her pregnant\"  .\n\n\nIn light of the book reviewed, I think that such insight is the\nclearest manifestation of reproductive rights that the Catholic Church should\nbe reminded of.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "53e601e4-ba26-41c0-8a76-681e9b8a0e6b", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.113558+00:00"}
{"text": "The Hardwood Patriarch: A History of the  San\nAgustin  Devotion of Tanza, Cavite ( 1795-1995)  \n\n\n by Jose Alain J. Austria \n\n\n  Chapter 1  \n\n\n  Introduction  \n\n \n\nThe preoccupation of Cavite&ntilde;o historiography with the\n1896-98 \" watershed &rdquo; produced a marked genre of town histories,\nwhich are nationalist, political and hero-centered.\n\n\nThese works were instrumental in bolstering the Cavite&ntilde;o 's\nenthusiasm for history and homegrown heroism.\n\n\nIt should be stressed however, that there 's more to the Tagalog\nprovince than the sagas of men in   rayadillo   .\n    rayadillo \n - the standard blue and white striped uniform of the army of the\nFirst Philippine Republic. \n\n\nThis study aims to be part of the growing body of works that dared to\ngo beyond the bounds of politics, into the sparsely explored realm of\nCavite&ntilde;o religious history. \n\n\n  Background of the Problem  \n\n \n\nLiterature-wise, that of the Virgin of   Porta Vaga\n  of Cavite City remains the most explored religious devotion\nin the province.   Officially named\n  Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Soledad de Porta Vaga \n ( Our Lady of Solitude of Porta Vaga), it is a small painting of\nthe Virgin Mary on the night of Good Friday.\n\n\nThe Virgin is shown wearing mourning robes while contemplating the\ninstruments of Jesus ' passion.\n\n\nThis 17th century icon was supposedly found floating near the Porta\nVaga gate of the walled port city, the day after a Spanish sentry claimed to\nhave witnessed a nocturnal apparition of the Virgin.\n\n\nPopular devotion to this icon was tied to the galleon trade and its\nperceived role in abating the 1882 cholera epidemic that swept the province.\n\n\n\nIt continues to be the focal point of grandiose hispanized\nfestivities dating back from the time of the galleons ( although it suffered\na decline after the city was destroyed by Japanese bombs in 1941).\n\n\nExtant historical writings on the said icon dates back to the 17th\ncentury.\n\n\nContemporary scholarly literature on the subject is readily available\nin libraries and even the world-wide web.\n\n\nApart from this, at least two other towns in Cavite hosts devotions\nof similar following ( but received lesser scholarly attention): Ternate (\n  Santo Ni&ntilde;o   ) and Tanza ( \n San Agustin   ) .\n\n\nIn both cases, the devotion does not only show borrowed colonial\nelements, but more importantly, indigenous idioms woven into the complex web\nof ritual and folklore.\n\n\nThe cult of the   Santo Ni&ntilde;o   in\nTernate for instance, is not only the focus of massive January pilgrimages.\n\n\nIt also has been the object of curiosity of local researchers,\nfascinated by the devotion 's eclectic interplay of Filipino, Spanish and\nIndonesian (   Mardikas   ) historical\nconnections.   This image of the \nSanto Ni&ntilde;o  was brought to the country in 1663 by a group of\nEast Indian Christian converts called the \"   Mardikas\n  \" , who chose to follow the Spaniards after the\nfall of the port of Ternate in the Spice Islands ( now known as the Maluku\nIslands).\n\n\nApart from the dark skinned Christ Child, the   Mardikas\n  also left two tangible legacies of their East Indian\nhomeland: the current town adopted the name \"  Ternate \n\" and a patois called \"   Ternate chavacano\n  \" ( unique for its intermingling of Filipino,\nSpanish and Indonesian words). \n\n\nIt is the   San Agustin   devotion of\nTanza however, that remains relatively untapped.\n\n\nThis, despite being a mainstay of Cavite&ntilde;o popular culture for\nmore than two centuries now.\n\n\nEvery 28th of August, devotees flock to this lowland town to pay\nhomage to   Tata Usteng   ( as he is fondly called.)\n\n\nCuriously, this day is not even the official fiesta of the town 's\nmajor parish, nor is  San Agustin  the real patron of the\ntown.\n\n\nHow this phenomenon grew in such an unusual circumstance made it\nsomewhat an object of curiosity.\n\n\nMore interesting, are the multi-faceted roles that   San\nAgustin   plays in this town 's social life: patron yet not,\nlocal patriarch, rain and water deity, miracle-worker, community symbol.\n\n\nSuch a unique religious tradition deserves not only a second look.\n\n\nFor delving into this subject may shed light on the dynamics of the\nTanze&ntilde;os' perception of the heavenly, and more importantly, their own\nhistory. \n\n\n  Statement of the Problem  \n\n \n\nThis study focuses on the history of the devotion to the 18th\ncentury image Saint Augustine of Hippo enshrined in the municipality of\nTanza, Cavite ( formerly,  Santa Cruz de Malabon  ) .\n\n\nSpecifically, it aims to draw a preliminary survey of the said\ndevotion 's history.\n\n\nTowards this end, it is particularly important to dwell into the\nfollowing problems:\n\n\n1. How did the San Agustin devotion start in Tanza?\n\n\n2. What were the developments that marked the devotion 's rise from\nan obscure saint cult in the early 19th century to one of Cavite 's most\npopular religious traditions in modern times?\n\n\n3. What were the marked changes in Tanza 's devotional text ( novena)\nand how does it reflect the historical shifts in attitude of the local\nclergy?\n\n\n4. How does the oral tradition revolving around the devotion mirror a\nparticular historical mentality of the town? \n\n\n  The Significance of the Study  \n\n \n\nThere was renewed enthusiasm towards the origins of the devotion\nto   San Agustin   since the 1990s.\n\n\nThis was especially evident in 1995 when the people of Tanza\ncelebrated the 200th anniversary of the discovery of the said image.\n\n\nTo put an emphasis on the long history of the devotion, an exhibit\nhighlighted the celebrations.\n\n\nFeatured in the exhibit, among other things, were the saint 's\n\" belongings\": finely embroidered clothes, antique miters and staffs,\nold photos, invitation, novenas  etc. \n\n\nAt the same time, short articles about the history of the said image\n( including alleged contemporary miracles) were published in souvenir\nprograms and other tracks.\n\n\nThe discovery of the image was even re-enacted through the narrow\nstreets of the   poblacion   , functioning as a\nvisual history book for the throngs of people who gathered.\n\n\nThese efforts are enough assurances that at least, \" \n San Agustin   histories &rdquo; exists at the communal\nlevel, and is very much part of popular consciousness.\n\n\nThe term \" \" histories &rdquo; \" is used to\nhighlight the plurality and the fragmentary nature of these accounts ( oral\nand written).\n\n\nWhat 's interesting is that despite the popularity of such, there was\nno effort to gather or organize these into a more formal and scholarly\nnarrative.\n\n\nIt is for this reason that this study is primarily conceived: to come\nup with a short monograph that would give readers an overview of the history\nof the   Tata Usteng   phenomenon, as sources permit.\n\n\n \n\nThis study will not only be of use within the bounds of religious\nhistory, but of local history as well.\n\n\nSince 1998, Cavite saw an increase in the number of town histories\npublished locally, apart from the traditional texts that had become perennial\nfeatures in souvenir programs.\n\n\nTowns like Kawit, Noveleta and Silang can now boast of comprehensive\nhistories of more scholarly tone.\n\n\nTanza, on the other hand, has yet to see a comprehensive town history\nin print.\n\n\nLocal historical committees and teachers had already initiated\nefforts to achieve the end, particularly in the political plane.\n\n\nEven earlier than this, previous efforts of native historians had\nalready made considerable gains, especially when it comes to the role of the\ntown in the Philippine Revolution ( Austria, 2001: 30-31). \n\n \n\nThere 's still much to be done however, if it 's a \n\" total history &rdquo;  that is wanted.\n\n\nNew developments in historical research had pushed to the forefront\nthis supreme ideal.\n\n\nAs the historical field embraces the whole of human experience as its\nsubject, the narrative centered in politics, or what happened in the town, is\ndeconstructed.\n\n\nTherefore, total histories are looking towards studies of subjects\nthat are not to be found nor were given emphasis in local historiography.\n\n\n \n\nThis has always been the dilemma of Cavite&ntilde;o\nhistoriography.\n\n\nSame with Tanza.\n\n\nIn the past, prime importance was given to topics like Aguinaldo 's\noath-taking at Sta. Cruz convent ( 1897)  ,\nnative-born national officials, the succession of mayors and other town\nofficials,  etc.   Emilio Aguinaldo took his\noath as President of the Revolutionary Government on March 23, 1897, a day\nafter the controversial convention at the Casa Hacienda de Tejeros in the\nneighboring town of Rosario. \n\n\nThere 's nothing intrinsically wrong in choosing these topics.\n\n\nThey deserve attention.\n\n\nBut since much material had already been written on these ( at least\nlocally), it should also serve as a signal that it 's time to focus on other\nthings.\n\n\nAspects like the economy, education, social structures, significant\ninstitutions, demography, folk culture, literature and religion remains\nsparsely explored.\n\n\nOnly excursions to these relatively unexplored topics can ensure that\na future  \" total town history &rdquo;  would not end up\nbeing solely  \" a political history of a town &rdquo;  (\nAustria, 2001: 31-32).\n\n\nThis study hopes to be a modest contribution to this ideal, if only\nto prove that Tanza is still interesting, independent of the favor Aguinaldo\nbestowed upon its humble convent. \n\n \n\nThe term \"  popular  \" in our subject\nmatter brings to mind the divide between the historically important local\npersonalities and the \" significant\", faceless   masa \n .\n\n\nTraditional historiography has always been generous towards the\ncontribution of homegrown heroes in each town 's saga.\n\n\nNobody can deny the importance of these people, especially in a\nprovince where the \"  Great Men Theory  \" is still\nfaithfully adhered to.\n\n\nOne of the classical canons in presenting history to the readers, the\n\"  Great Men Theory  \" focuses on the exemplary\nlife and deeds of so-called \"  heroes  \" .\n\n\nThis preoccupation with great individuals fulfill a two-point\npurpose: first, for history to be more attractive and fascinating for the\nreaders; secondly, the heroism epitomized by these men may inspire people to\nimitate them, particularly in the service of the motherland ( Delagoza,\n1993:101).\n\n\nBut the ideal of \" total history &rdquo; certainly demands a\nmore egalitarian view of a town 's saga.\n\n\nA Tanza viewed from the top of the social spectrum is definitely an\nincomplete picture.\n\n\nTo put some semblance of balance, ways must be done to study the\nhistorical perspective of the unnamed, the masses.\n\n\nReynaldo Ileto had long espoused the idea of writing \"\nhistories from below\".\n\n\nHe believes that in traditional history, the masses are not allowed\nto speak for themselves.\n\n\nWe cannot simply dismiss the masses as submissive and receptive to\nthe forces coming from the   pueblo   center (\nGealogo, 1993:52-53).\n\n\nIt also stressed that the masses were not simply unknowing victims of\nthe determining forces of history.\n\n\nInstead, they highlighted the capacity of the peripheral to make\ntheir own history, distinctly apart from that of the politically empowered\nand the economically significant. \n\n \n\nIt is in the cultural front that the proactive power of the\nlabeled \" nameless &rdquo; is most evident.\n\n\nSince this study 's subject matter is a part of popular religious\nculture, it may present a different picture of Tanza as a society.\n\n\nThe folk appeal of   Tata Usteng   is\ndefinitely a good text in studying the mentality of Tanza 's historical\nconsciousness.\n\n\nThis study intends to present a new, periphery-based perspective\nthrough which the town 's history can be viewed. \n Several studies on Philippine rural history saw local cultural\ntraditions and their material aspects reflectors of a society 's historical\nperspective.\n\n\nFor an excellent treatise using this approach, see Mojares ( 1985).\n \n\n \n\nTo sum up, this study is of significance to local historiography\nfor three reasons.\n\n\nFirst, it presents a preliminary overview of the development of a\nlocal religious devotion in an organized historical narrative.\n\n\nSecond, it is a contribution to a much wider project, which is the\ncompletion of a comprehensive town history for Tanza.\n\n\nAnd third, it seeks to present an alternative perspective of history,\nthrough the eyes of ordinary people, with a religious tradition as locus of\nstudy. \n\n\n  Review of Related Literature  \n\n \n\nSince this work is pioneering in nature, it does not have the\nluxury of past serious studies on the subject matter as points of reference.\n\n\nIn fact, researches using rigid documentation and a framework for\nanalysis are totally non-existent.\n\n\nNevertheless, there is one particular manuscript that provided the\nresearcher the necessary footing needed to go on with the study. \n\n \n\nEntitled \"  The History and Cultural Life of Tanza,\nCavite  \" ( 1953), this unpublished manuscript by Mariano\nMontano was the product of the earliest attempt of locals to consolidate oral\ntestimonies into a formal written history.\n\n\nApparently, this work was intended to be part of the Historical Data\nPapers ( HDP) of the National Library.\n\n\nFor some reason, this manuscript never reached its destination.\n\n\nThere 's absolutely nothing on Tanza to be found in the current HDP\ncollection.  ...", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "abcddae6-1c0d-4350-a70f-d7fa47e14d78", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.114824+00:00"}

the\nhuman species.\n\n\nHumans have developed to a great extent that they 've reached\nprofound stage of knowledge.\n\n\nThis knowledge is powerful enough to make non-living things to\nevolve.\n\n\nOne of which is technology.\n\n\nTechnology has changed from very simple machines that humans use in\ntheir simple work to very complex computers, which have their own way of\nlogical thinking, which they use in their now more multifaceted, thus very\ncomplicated activities.\n\n\nThe logical thinking of the present computers was successfully\npatterned from humans ' logical thinking.\n\n\nAnd same as the evolution of living things, the technology 's\nevolution is in a continuous process.\n\n\nThis time, humans are trying to incorporate to computers another\nimportant aspect they have, emotions. \n\n \n\nAccording to Picard as cited by McCauley and Franklin ( 1999), we\nhave reached a point in the development of computers where we need to study\nand utilize the abandoned role of emotion.\n\n\nScientists and researchers think that emotions should be added to\ncomputers because it was found out that emotions play a critical role in\nrational and intelligent behavior [ PICA, ETAL01].\n\n\nFurthermore, several studies have supported the claim that emotions\nhave a significant role in decision-making and performance as well [\nKORT&REIL02].\n\n\nIn addition, the integration of emotions to computers would help\nproduce more believable artificial intelligence, which humans could use in\ntheir work [ PERR96]. \n\n \n\nDue to these findings, several projects and systems have been\ndeveloped for this field.\n\n\nHowever, researchers are still discontented with these models.\n\n\nThey attributed this production of shallow models with the\ndifficulties encountered in this new field.\n\n\nDespite the many difficulties in the development of artificial\nintelligence with emotions, several researchers and projects are still being\ndone in this field in order to build a better relationship between humans and\ncomputers. \n\n \n\nThis paper presents some of the important points in the field of\nemotion addition to computers.\n\n\nThis paper focuses on the purposes of emotion addition to computers.\n\n\nIt also discusses some of the recent systems and projects being\ndeveloped in this field.\n\n\nAnd also, the some of the difficulties researchers encounter in\ndeveloping these systems and projects. \n\n\n  THE ROLE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN HUMAN-COMPUTER\nRELATIONSHIP  \n\n \n\nOur technology has shown a great development in the past years.\n\n\nThis flourishing technology has a primary purpose of rendering human\nusers with a more efficient and convenient work environment.\n\n\nThus, each and every step in any technological development aims to\nbring more convenience to human users. \n\n \n\nAn example is the step-by-step development of the personal\ncomputers we have today.\n\n\nThe very first computers were built to assist humans in their\ncomputations.\n\n\nHowever, humans have a wide variety of works and activities aside\nfrom doing computations such as photo editing, document editing, and even\nprogram development.\n\n\nThus, the computer systems were slowly innovated to accommodate these\nactivities.\n\n\nThis can be clearly seen in the personal computers or desktops we\nhave in our homes and offices today.\n\n\nPeople are now really dependent on our technology.\n\n\nSome may see their computers as their best friends and interact with\nthem like the way they interact with humans. \n\n \n\nThis attitude may be justified by the connection between a\nhuman-human relationship and human-computer relationship.\n\n\nPicard ( 2000a) presents the idea that a connection exists between\nthe two in the sense that the factors, which affect human-human relationship,\nare also the factors, which affect human-computer relationship.\n\n\nCorrespondingly, as Picard stated, one of these factors in a\nhuman-human relationship is emotional intelligence. \n\n \n\nTo be emotionally intelligent, a person should be able to\nrecognize the emotions of the other person and be able to give an appropriate\nresponse to them [ PICA00a].\n\n\nThe acquisition of this ability is said to play a very important role\nin the process of learning.\n\n\nAlso, it can influence a person 's capability of meeting important\nparts of his or her life.\n\n\nFurthermore, it also has a role in the field of medicine and\nentertainment [ PICA, ETAL01].\n\n\nSince emotional intelligence is a very influential factor in a\nhuman-human relationship, it is also considered as an important factor in a\nhuman-computer relationship.\n\n\nThis analogy drives scientists and researchers to work in the\nproduction of agents and systems, which are emotionally intelligent.\n\n\nFor them, the incorporation of emotions to artificial intelligence\npaves the way for a better interaction between human users and computers.\n\n\n \n\nAs humans become more and more dependent on computers, they begin\nto entrust them with very important jobs.\n\n\nHowever, some human activities produce a lot of questions when\nentrusted to computers because they are said to be for humans only.\n\n\nExamples of these are babysitting and counseling. \n\n \n\nWhen a mother leaves her child in the care of a babysitter, this\nmeans that the mother trusts the babysitter.\n\n\nActually, in a human-human relationship, every person must have to\ntrust another person if he or she leaves something valuable to him or her.\n\n\nThis trust may arise from the thought that the other person knows how\nto take care of something valuable meaning that the caretaker should have\nenough knowledge about it and should be able to efficiently apply this\nknowledge in his or her work.\n\n\nThis ability includes not only the use of intelligence but also the\nuse of emotions. \n\n \n\nSince present systems and agents are already incorporated with\nartificial intelligence, the problem is that of emotions.\n\n\nIf artificially intelligent agents could show signs of emotions,\nhuman users might be able to entrust them with the mentioned activities\nbecause the users might feel that the agents have the ability to understand\nthem.\n\n\nIn the process, trust would be built in the human-computer\nrelationship. \n\n \n\nIn interacting with computers, human users could feel different\nemotions.\n\n\nSome of the most commonly felt emotions in human-computer interaction\nare negative in nature.\n\n\nExamples are frustration, irritation, and other stress-related\nfeelings [ PICA01a].\n\n\nThese negative emotions may arise from the dissatisfaction of the\nuser to the computer.\n\n\nThe presence of these negative feelings might cause more problems in\na human-computer relationship.\n\n\nA possible solution to this problem is for the computers to have\nemotions or recognize the user 's emotions. \n\n \n\nAn advantage of making the computer recognize the user 's emotion\nis that it can try out different possible responses to the user.\n\n\nThis can be done by determining which response is the most pleasing.\n\n\nIn this view, the computer must also be able to sense user feedbacks\n[ PICA01b]. \n\n \n\nThese responses to the users may help the users to manage their\nemotional state.\n\n\nFor example, when a user suddenly experiences frustration because of\nthe slow data processing of a computer, the emotionally intelligent computer\nmay lessen the user 's frustration by giving an apologetic message or by\nimproving the speed of its data processing.\n\n\nIn this process, information where the users feel frustrated may be\ncollected and be sent to system developers for them to use in performance\nimprovement.\n\n\nThe improvements made may positively contribute in building a better\nhuman-computer relationship. \n\n\n  RECENT DEVELOPED SYSTEMS OR PROJECTS OF COMMUNICATING\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WITH EMOTIONS  \n\n \n\nIn line with the challenge of successfully adding emotions to\nartificial intelligence, several recent projects and systems are being\ndeveloped.\n\n\nThese include both hardware and software tools, which enables the\ncomputer to sense emotions and its patterns. \n\n \n\nThe projects and systems are classified under two main\ncategories.\n\n\nThese two main categories are the \" \" self-report\nsystem &rdquo; \" and \" \" concurrent expression system\n&rdquo; \" [ PICA00a]. \n\n \n\nThe first category is the \" self-report system\".\n\n\nProjects and systems under this category provide the user with a set\nof choices through words or icons, or hardware input devices for the user to\nconvey his or her emotions [ PICA00a].\n\n\nWhenever the user feels a certain emotion, he or she can relay it to\nthe system by selecting one of the choices.\n\n\nEach and every item in the selection represents a certain emotion.\n\n\n \n\nThis category primarily gives the user with awareness on the\nmessage he or she will give out to the computer [ PICA00a].\n\n\nThis ability of the system serves as its advantage over the other\ncategory, which will be discussed later.\n\n\nIf the user has a full conscious control over his or her message, the\ninput emotion would be more or less accurate because the one who experienced\nit has chosen it himself or herself.\n\n\nIn addition, the user could just give the computer only the type of\nemotion he or she wants. \n\n \n\nHowever, this also serves as its disadvantage in the sense that\nthe user 's main task being performed is interrupted [ PICA00a].\n\n\nIf the user needs to convey his or her emotions to the computer in a\ncertain situation, the user has to stop what he or she is doing for him or\nher to be able to choose from the set of words, icons, or other input\ndevices.\n\n\nAs a result, the user is distracted from his main activity. \n\n \n\nAn example of a project, which uses the \" self-report\nsystem', is the \" \" thumbs-up feedback &rdquo; \" .\n\n\nThis system is attached to a machine, which provides consumers with\nready-made coffee [ PICA00a].\n\n\nThis system includes two choices, namely the thumbs-up and\nthumbs-down icons.\n\n\nWhenever the user is satisfied with the produced coffee of the\nsystem, the user can just tap the thumbs-up icon to let the computer know of\nhis or her satisfaction.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the thumbs-down icon can be tapped whenever the\nuser is dissatisfied with the system 's performance. \n\n \n\nAnother example of a project under this category is the ASQ or\nAffective Social Quotient.\n\n\nThis project intends to aid autistic children in expressing and\ncommunicating their emotions in different situations [ PICA01a].\n\n\nThe system executes this by showing the children chosen videos, which\ncould arouse different emotions.\n\n\nFor the child to communicate his or her emotion, he or she could\npick one or more dwarfs in the choices.\n\n\nEach dwarf denotes an emotion being studied. \n\n \n\nThe other category used in the development of systems and\nprojects of artificial intelligence with emotions is the \" concurrent\nexpression system\".\n\n\nSystems under this category can sense emotions with the help of\ndifferent sensors.\n\n\nThe type of sensor to be used will be up to the user 's decision or\nchoice [ PICA00a]. \n\n \n\nAs stated earlier, one disadvantage of the \" self-report\nsystem &rdquo; is the frequent interruption of the user 's main task just to\ncommunicate his or her emotion [ PICA00a].\n\n\nThe solution to this problem is provided by the second category.\n\n\nIn this category, the sensors remove the user 's impediment in\ncommunicating his or her emotion because the sensors perceive emotions\nindependently [ PICA00a].\n\n\nIn this way, the user doesn't need to stop what her or she is doing\nin order to relay what he or she feels. \n\n \n\nHowever, this does not mean that the second category has no\nhindering difficulty.\n\n\nThis category is far from being perfect.\n\n\nIt still has a disadvantage for the users.\n\n\nAnd this is connected with the issue of privacy. \n\n \n\nPrivacy is one of the most treasured ideas of individuals.\n\n\nThis, however, is said to be hindered with the use of the systems\nand projects under this category.\n\n\nUsers might feel uneasy with the thought of having a machine sense\nhis or her feelings [ PICA00a].  ...", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source":

{"text": "1. ( a). The difference of the 2 articles is that in the 1st\narticle, the intervention of the state in the economy is highly reduced; the\ndemocracy of the country highly affects the economy 's growth.\n\n\nThe state possesses a great difference in economic development.\n\n\nWhatever decision the state makes affects the economy.\n\n\nMaybe because of the fact that the people control the future of their\neconomy based on their present actions and decisions.\n\n\nWhereas in the 2nd article, it says that the economy is fast rising\never since the Ramos Administration started.\n\n\nThe optimism showed in the second article states that the government 's\nefforts will not be sent down the drain and that the state helped in the\neconomic dev't. \n\n \n\nb. The strategies in the 2nd article is based on the decrease in\nthe public 's hold on the economy.\n\n\nIf ever the state 's hold becomes lesser and lesser, the economy 's\ngrowth will zoom up.\n\n\nIn the first article it also says that the intervention of the state\nis highly reduced to bring about economic growth.\n\n\nSo I guess both articles have the same strategy. \n\n \n\nc. The main player in the first article is the state, but it says\nin the article that they are <unclear> one word </unclear> with state\nwithdrawal.\n\n\nThe public 's hold and functions tend to be underemphasized.\n\n\nThe economy 's development doesn't grow, but instead it weakens.\n\n\nThere are people from the state who are rich and still become richer,\nwhile the others,  vice versa  .\n\n\nIn the 2nd article, the private sector is given more attention rather\nthan the state or the public sector.\n\n\nWith the rapid depletion of the public sector, to the economy, new\nstrategies are formed.\n\n\nAnd as the growth of the economy zooms even higher, the state is\ngreatly reduced. \n\n \n\nd. The 1st analysis didn't quite emphasize everything I thought\nwere necessary, there were some things left out, like <unclear> one word\n</unclear> did state withdrawal have to be done, and when it started.\n\n\nMaybe they answered the question already by saying the first 3 years\nof the Aquino adm. \n\n\nBut I 'm not really sure.\n\n\nAlthough the analysis of both were good and in understandable terms.\n\n\nThe strategies, though, were not clearly stated, and also who were\nreally pointed out as center of attraction. \n\n \n\n2. The Philippines ' government has already been known for its\ninefficiency & corruption.\n\n\nBut I think now the Ramos Administration is working quite well.\n\n\nThe service needed for economic development cannot be totally\nattained or assumed by the private sector, I think the state should help in\nthe economy 's growth.\n\n\nEach organization in the country should be connected to the other\norgs  in the country.\n\n\nThey should join their services to be of greater help to the economy.\n\n\nMaybe, one by one we can make our economy warm up, but together, we 'll\nget there. \n\n \n\n3. Power is basically the capacity to get others to comply with\nthe use of threat of severe sanctions or the promise of national rewards.\n\n\nHaving power means getting others to do your bidding by threatening\nthem something not good happening.\n\n\nPower has 2 properties, Relational and intentional.\n\n\nPower in the Relational Aspect measures the capacity of a political\nactor 's power to another.\n\n\nThe other is intentional, in which you have a certain purpose why you\nthreaten others or get them to comply to your bidding. \n\n \n\nA concrete example of power would be the Marcos Administration.\n\n\nWe were threatened by the Marcoses of punishment if we didn't follow\norders or the rules of the Marcoses, especially when he proposed the Martial\nLaw.\n\n\nWe were also threatened by the Spaniards with punishment and even\ndeath, in our Philippine History.\n\n\nWhen the Spaniards took over our land, they were controlling us and\nwere using us as slaves in our own lands.\n\n\nAnd another example would be the American regime.\n\n\nThe Americans were supposedly helping us from the clutches of the\nJapanese, but their true intention was to make us inferior to them.  \n\n \n\n1. What is Politics?\n\n\nIs Politics a restricted activity confined on what goes within\ngovernment or state or does it occur in all areas of social life?\n\n\nHow would you explain the concept of Politics to Juan de la Cruz?\n\n\n \n\n2. Is government necessary or can societies be stable and\nsuccessful in the absence of government?\n\n\nDiscuss the present state of Phil. government and cite a current\nissue.  \n\n \n\n( 1) Politics is the activity directed toward or taking place\nwithin the formal institutions we call our government.\n\n\nIt may also be cited as the use of power for one 's own benefit.\n\n\nMany people and politicians use Politics to gain power, and when they\ndo, they abuse it.\n\n\nPolitics is not a restricted activity confined to the government.\n\n\nIt happens all around us.\n\n\nMaybe fighting over something like a can of food between two kids may\nbe called politics.\n\n\nDepending on how they themselves and how or what they do to get what\nthey want.\n\n\nI 'm not really sure on how I would explain the concept of Politics\nto Juan de la Cruz.\n\n\nMaybe Juan de la Cruz would be a type of person who would try\nanything and do anything to get what he wants.\n\n\nTypical attitude among us Filipinos.\n\n\nPolitics would be something Juan would use to gain Power.\n\n\nHe would use politics to be among the people in the higher and upper\nclass.\n\n\nPolitics would be just a stairway to power for Juan de la Cruz. \n\n \n\n( 2) I 'm not really sure if societies can be stable and\nsuccessful in the absence of government.\n\n\nThey probably would have a hard time in decision making, without\nanyone to lead or watch over them.\n\n\nSocieties would probably fall down and not be able to stand up\nwithout a responsible, fair and just government watching over and governing\nthem.\n\n\nA large society may not be able to decide for themselves and help\nthemselves out if not for a government.\n\n\nI think the Philippine government is in a state of panic and shock\nbecause of the flash floods and damages brought about by the monsoons.\n\n\nThey probably are in a hurry to make some necessary actions to fix up\nthe damages like dikes being destroyed, floods, and holes in the roads.\n\n\nI think the government is also in panic because they probably are\ndeciding on how to cut the traffic jam in our country.\n\n\nEverywhere is traffic.\n\n\nIn the provinces, in the city.\n\n\nBut I think our government has been doing their job, not really\nexcellently, but in a fine way and they may have been doing their job fairly\nand justly.\n\n\nSo I think our government 's status is okay.  \n\n\n\n \n\n1. a) The role of the state in economic dev't in the 1st article\nis to allocate/distribute equal power and control of businesses to both rich\nand poor people.\n\n\nThe first article is against the withdrawal of state from the\neconomy.\n\n\nIf the state withdraws from the economy, big business elites will\nhave greater control of productive assets while the poor will be poorer and\npoorer.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the 2nd article explains that the role of the\nstate in the economy isn't needed in order to achieve economic dev't.\n\n\nIn this article, the privatization process is the most appropriate\nway in order to achieve the true economic dev't.\n\n\nThe privatization of the business establishments especially the big\nones will pull up our economy since privatization process will open more\nareas for investment activities in the Phil. economy. \n\n \n\nb) In the first article, the strategy for development is the\nintervention of the state in business.\n\n\nThis means that state plays a role in economy.\n\n\nIn the 2nd article, the strategy for dev't is the privatization\nprocess.\n\n\nThis means that state withdraws their participation in the economy.\n\n\n \n\nc) In the first article, the main player for nat'l dev't is the\nstate.\n\n\nIn the second article, the main player for nat'l dev't are the\nprivate sector. \n\n\nd)  Strengths: \n\n \n\n1st Article- because of the state 's intervention in economy, the\npoor will be given a chance to also participate in the economy.\n\n\nThis will help eradicate the  \" pagsasamantala &rdquo;\n of some big private establishments in terms of pricing. \n\n \n\n2nd Article- privatization of businesses will help in the\neconomic dev't since there will be no or less corrupt officials.\n\n\nAnother strength is that state won't manage to run some big business\nestablishments which need great amount of money.\n\n\nSo, no need to collect taxes/funds from the people just to run such\nbusinesses. \n\n\n Weakness: \n\n \n\nArticle 1- If the state will intervene in the economy, this means\nthat more corrupt officials are there.\n\n\nCorrupt officials will just cause the downfall of the economy.\n\n\nAnother is that the money which will be used will come from the\npeople.\n\n\nSo this means that even people will still give some money even if\ntheir money isn't enough for their daily needs. \n\n \n\nArticle 2- Overpricing of goods might be the result since it 's\nin the control of private sectors. \n\n\n2.) I don't think the state should privatize its <unclear> one word\n</unclear> to have economic dev't.\n\n\nThe poor will be getting poorer since they won't have the chance to\nparticipate in business affairs if privatization process will be implemented.\n\n\nThe poor will become poorer.\n\n\nOverpricing of goods & services may result.\n\n\nWhat the state & gov't should do in order to improve their public\nservice is to remove the suspected corrupt officials.\n\n\nThey should also apply some trend in the economy use by both rich\ncountries which they think will help in the economic growth and betterment of\npublic services.\n\n\nFor me, just the prompt payment of taxes by the citizens will\ncontribute greatly to the dev't of Phil.\n\n\nI say so because, tax is the main and the hugest source of the Phil.\nfunds. \n\n \n\n3.) Historically, throughout the years, power have been used to\nlet others comply with one 's wishes.\n\n\nPower is use in order to achieve one 's goal.\n\n\nEven in the earlier years, power had been already exercise by our\nleaders.\n\n\nOne of the three examples of this is that about the choosing of our\nnat'l  language during the reign of Pres. Quezon.\n\n\nWe all know that Tagalog was chosen as our nat'l language before\nbecause of the power of the Pres.\n\n\nAnother example is about the Martial Law during the reign of former\nPres. Marcos.\n\n\nWithout the knowledge of the people, Martial Law was still declared.\n\n\nThe last example which is the most recent among the three is about\nthe SPCPD.\n\n\nSPCPD was also approved by Pres. Ramos even though many people or\nmajority are against its implementation.\n\n\nSo basically, the use of power already happened before.  \n\n \n\n1.) What is politics?\n\n\nIs politics restricted or confined to what goes within gov't or\nstate, or does it occur in all areas of social life?\n\n\nHow would you explain the concept of politics to Juan de la Cruz?\n\n\n \n\n2.) Is gov't necessary or can societies be stable or successful\nin the absence of Gov't?\n\n\nDiscuss the present state of Phil. Gov't and cite a current issue\nto backup your argument.  \n\n\n ANSWERS: \n\n \n\n1. Politics is a  set of activities--as human activities and\nsocial activities. \n\n\nPolitics  developed out of diversity  .\n\n\n Existence of conflict happens in Politics  .\n\n\nSince conflicts arise in politics, then politics is also about \ndecision making  in order to solve the conflicts within the activities.\n\n\nAnd these decisions do not only come from one person, rather\ndecisions are from the people involve in the activities.\n\n\nThe decisions is called  collective decisions  .\n\n\nBy the way, these human activities include power, influence, money,\nauthority, laws, bills, leaders, competition, organization, and many other\nactivities which can be considered as human activities.\n\n\nThere are 2 major components in the study of Politics--the normative\n& the empirical.\n\n\nThose who are interested in human activities are called <unclear>\n one word  </unclear> .\n\n\nPolitics  does  occur in all areas of social life.\n\n\nPolitics does not only happen inside the gov't but also outside the\ngov't.\n\n\nBase on the definition itself that it is a set of human activities,\nso politics really occurs in all areas of social life, since what are involve\nhere are all humans.\n\n\nAnd about explaining the concept of politics to Juan de la Cruz, I\nwould tell him that he is also involve in politics.\n\n\nRich or poor people are involve in politics so they should cooperate\nand join the politics or human activities. \n\n \n\n2. No, societies won't be successful if there is no Gov't.\n\n\nGov't is necessary because it 's the gov't that plans, manages, &\nimposes rules and regulations.\n\n\nWithout the gov't, lots of misunderstandings & conflicts will arise\nthan having a gov't since all if not part of the societies will proclaim\nthemselves leaders of the societies.\n\n\nOne will not follow another.\n\n\nSo what the Phil Gov't has is the division of power in the country.\n\n\nFor example, the Phil. gov't has air force, police, NBI, marines,\nSenate  etc.  which are responsible for the task only\nassigned to them.\n\n\nNow, there is this SPCPD issue.\n\n\nThe gov't officials ( Pres., Senators,  etc.  )\nare the ones who were given the power to discuss this issue not the armed\nforces of the Phil.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "2a4f4e5c-3425-45b2-98e6-4f959d08a6f4", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.116996+00:00"}
{"text": "Bus Drivers' Way of Driving \n\n\nJason M. Balingit\n\n \n\nThere are a lot of drivers in Metro Manila.\n\n\nSome are careful and some are careless.\n\n\nAll have different styles and way of driving.\n\n\nThere are taxi drivers and jeepney drivers but bus drivers is a good\ntopic to talk about. \n\n \n\nThere are three kinds of bus drivers.\n\n\nThe first kind thinks that his bus is a racer.\n\n\nHe is the type of driver who likes to speed up whenever possible that\nhe wants to go to their destination as fast as he can.\n\n\nHe believes that this kind of driving is careful that they will not\nbe involved in an accident.\n\n\nHe is not afraid of involving in an accident because he was never\ninvolved in his past.\n\n\nIn this kind of driving, passengers will not feel sleepy and will\nnever forget this ride. \n\n \n\nThe second is a slow driver.\n\n\nHe likes to pick-up almost all passengers on his way even if there\nare no vacant seats.\n\n\nThe ride is very slow that time is doubled an ordinary ride.\n\n\nThis kind is very common to bus drivers that the bus is overloaded\nand has little spaces because of the number of passengers. \n\n \n\nThe third doesn't like overloading and he only picks passengers\nif there are vacant seats.\n\n\nHe is careful on his driving that the bus is neither very fast nor\nvery slow.\n\n\nHe cares for his passengers and he secures their safety.\n\n\nHe is afraid of involving in an accident that he doesn't want to lose\nlives.\n\n\nWith these drivers, passengers are calm and can secure their safety.\n\n\n \n\nI have experienced riding with these three kinds of drivers and I\nlike riding with the third one.\n\n\nI hope all bus drivers are like him.  \n\n\n\n\n Rock of All Kinds \n\n\nArnie Sugay\n\n \n\nI 've been a fan of Rock music all my life.\n\n\nAs a matter of fact I 'm a rock band member when I was in High\nSchool.\n\n\nRock has its many branches, the different types of rock based on\ntheir sound and tempo or speed. \n\n \n\nAs I classify them, there are four types of rock.\n\n\nThe first one is the ever famous Rock and Roll.\n\n\nRock and Roll is a bit faster compared to other types of rock music.\n\n\nThe sounds of distorted guitars and fast drumbeats are dominant.\n\n\nSome examples of rock and roll artist are Mike Hanopol and the band\nbehind the hit song \" \"  Sabado  Nights &rdquo;\n\" , \" Rizal Underground \" .\n\n\nThe second one is Alternative Rock.\n\n\nIt sounds similar to rock and roll only the guitars are louder and\nvery much distorted.\n\n\nAlternative Rock can be slow or fast depending on the artist.\n\n\nThe very big difference between Rock and Roll and Alternative Rock is\nthe latter is much noisier.\n\n\nIn the Philippines, one famous alternative rock band is the band\nknown as \" Wolfgang \" .\n\n\nThe third one is the Blues.\n\n\nThe sound of the Blues is quite amusing.\n\n\nGuitars are plain and not distorted and the drumbeat follows a\ndefinite pattern.\n\n\nBlues are commonly faster than average.\n\n\nThe legendary Freddie Aguilar is an example of Blues and Folk artist.\n\n\nThe last and most popular to the youth is the Pop Rock.\n\n\nIt is sometimes slow or fast.\n\n\nPop Rock artists have the choice to use distorted guitars or not.\n\n\nCommonly they use combinations of plain and distorted guitars.\n\n\nA very famous Pop Rock band is \" The Eraserheads \"\nknown for their unique kind of music.  \n\n\n\n\n Commuters in Traffic \n\n\nSonny Francis Cubillo\n\n \n\nTraffic is a part of commuters everyday life.\n\n\nWe Filipinos being known to easily adapt to any situation have\ndevised ways in which how to spend time in traffic.\n\n\nEach one capable of devising ways of spending their time in traffic.\n\n\n \n\nThere are four classification of commuters according to the way\nthey spend their time in traffic: Sleepers, Chatters, Grumblers and Workers.\n\n\nThe sleepers are those who spend their time sleeping in the vehicle.\n\n\nSleeping is a way in which they can rest a bit and at the same time\ngain energy from it.\n\n\nThis is also a way to relieve oneself of boredom.\n\n\nThe chatters are those who spend their time talking either to the\ndriver or their seatmates.\n\n\nChatters usually start a conversation by giving comments on the\ntraffic problem in the country.\n\n\nThen the chatting goes on to many different subjects until they reach\ntheir destination.\n\n\nConversing with others is a good way of ridding oneself boredom and\nit gives one a chance to meet other people.\n\n\nGrumblers are characterized as those who spend their time complaining\nand showing a grouchy face.\n\n\nThese type usually had a bad day and therefore puts all his anger on\nthe traffic.\n\n\nThey don't want to be disturbed.\n\n\nThey get mad easily at anything.\n\n\nNo one wants or dares to sit beside a grumbler.\n\n\nWell probably the best way in spending their time in traffic are the\nways in which a worker does.\n\n\nWorkers are those who spend their time by doing worthwhile things\nlike studying, finishing their office work or sometimes cross-stitching.\n\n\nWorkers are able to make good of the wasted time in traffic.\n\n\nThough reading is a good way of spending wasted time, this practice\nis harmful to the eye for reading in a moving transportation is bad for the\neye.\n\n\nStill for me it 's still best to spend time in traffic this way. \n\n \n\nTraffic is a part of everyday life.\n\n\nWhether we like it or not we have to do something or spend our time\nin boredom and a time in boredom is like eternity.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n Different Strokes \n\n\nJorge L. de Jesus II\n\n \n\nIn the Olympics or in any type of sports organization, various\ntypes of sporting events have always been held.\n\n\nThere are the ever present running events, throwing events, field\nevents, team sports such as basketball and volleyball.\n\n\nBut one of my most favored events is the swimming event. \n\n \n\nThrough the years four different types of strokes have been used\nin the Olympics which vary in speed and are as follows: the breast stroke,\nthe back stroke, the freestyle, and the butterfly.\n\n\nThe breaststroke is the slowest among the four types.\n\n\nThis stroke is very slow, compared to the others, for the reason that\none has to fully submerge the whole body to execute the propelling motion and\nraise the body afterwards in order to gain momentum.\n\n\nThe next one is the back stroke.\n\n\nThis is faster than the breast stroke because one doesn't have to\nsubmerge and raise the body from the water, but rather propel oneself forward\nin a lying position.\n\n\nThe freestyle is rather faster than the backstroke.\n\n\nThe swimmer in this manner would have to swim with the belly facing\nthe water and propel oneself.\n\n\nThis is much easier and can be done with greater power and speed\ncompared to the first two strokes.\n\n\nThe butterfly is the fastest one, but it is much harder to execute.\n\n\nThis stroke requires a lot of flexibility and strength on both arms,\nbecause one would have to use them simultaneously.\n\n\nBy using both arms and with the correct body movements, speed can be\nmaximized.  \n\n\n\n\n Cab Drivers \n\n\nRex Edward M. Deya\n\n \n\nWe ride the cab whenever we 're in a hurry.\n\n\nEverytime we ride a cab we meet a new person, the cab driver himself.\n\n\nAnd sometimes we talk to them or remain silent at all.\n\n\nBut what bothers me at all is that I have encountered the 4 types of\ncab drivers.\n\n\nThe first is the reckless driver, he takes the road as if it is his\nand that 's what I 'm afraid of because I have a phobia on too much speed.\n\n\nMaybe the drivers attitude maybe seen on the way he drives or cares\nfor his passengers.\n\n\nThe second type are the dishonest cab drivers because they are\ntampering the cab meter just to get enough out of you.\n\n\nThese kind of cab drivers should be sent to jail or something so that\nthey may learn their lesson and never cheat again.\n\n\nCab drivers should be friendly because I hate rude drivers.\n\n\nThe third type of cab drivers are the rude ones.\n\n\nI 'm scared whenever I learn that my cab driver is rude.\n\n\nI 'm scared on the way he looks to me and to other people.\n\n\nAnd whenever you start a simple conversation with him his reply\nwould be--looking at you saying that  \" you get the message.\n&rdquo; \n\n\nThe fourth type are the honest ones.\n\n\nThey are the rarest breeds among the four.\n\n\nThey tell jokes and everything.\n\n\nThese people are dedicated to their jobs.\n\n\nTheir main goal is to help people get to their destination.\n\n\nThey need money and they are getting it in a nice way while others\ncheat just to get more money.\n\n\nThese drivers are friendly, courteous, and most of all not reckless.\n\n\nSo whenever you take the cab distinguish first if he is your type of\ndriver.  \n\n\n\n\n Dressing Up inside a Mall \n\n\nRonaldo L. Guevara\n\n \n\nThe way you dress up inside a mall tells something about your\npurpose for going there.\n\n\nTry sitting on a bench for some time and you would probably be able\nto distinguish a few types of dressers. \n\n \n\nThe most obvious type of dressers is the one who wears a\nuniform.\n\n\nThis could be a salesperson, a security guard, an officeworker, or a\nstudent.\n\n\nOne could usually see from the person 's face that he/she is not\ncontent about the clothes he/she wears.\n\n\nIf given a choice on what to wear, this person would wear something\nmore comfortable than the starched and ironed prison that he/she has worn.\n\n\n \n\nOn the opposite end is the person who wears very fresh attire:\nwalking shorts,  sando  , slippers, maybe even a cap or\nsunglasses.\n\n\nThis person looks as if he/she has gone to the mall straight out of\nbed.\n\n\nThis person is usually from a neighboring village, and he/she went\nthere to escape the noontime heat.\n\n\nThis same person vanishes as soon as the sun goes down. \n\n \n\nAnother easily distinguishable dresser is the hip-hop.\n\n\nThis person is usually male and wears clothes five sizes bigger than\nnormal.\n\n\nHis pants are big and baggy, while his t-shirt could pass for a one\npiece dress.\n\n\nHe often wears a bandanna or a bonnet around his head, and wears\nboots or rubber shoes.\n\n\nHe often hangs out with others of his kind, talking with them on a\nbench that they claimed as his own. \n\n \n\nThere is a type of person who wears black everything, even\nthough he/she doesn't seem to be mourning.\n\n\nThe person is also usually male, but he sports long hair.\n\n\nTogether with his attire are torn pants, heavy boots, and silver\nchains around his neck.\n\n\nHe often hangs out in musical equipment shops and avoids the\nhip-hop, who is his sworn enemy. \n\n \n\nFinally, there is the simple casual dresser.\n\n\nHe/she wears blue jeans, a t-shirt, and loafers/ \nespadrilles  .\n\n\nThis person is usually a mere passerby, and passes through the mall\nevery single day.\n\n\nHe/she ducks into a store or two along the way, but usually emerges\nwithout a shopping bag.\n\n\nAs soon as this person satisfies his/her curiosity, he/she continues\nhome. \n\n \n\nIt 's often quite amusing to observe people and the way they\ndress.\n\n\nAs an old proverb says,  the way a person dresses reflects\nhis or her personality. \n\n\nThat could be right.\n\n\nHowever, another proverb tells us  not to judge a book by its\ncover. \n\n\nWhich one should we heed?  \n\n\n\n\n Guitar Amplifiers \n\n\nArio Ubando\n\n \n\nI love to play my electric guitar.\n\n\nSometimes I play blues, sometimes heavy metal, and sometimes punk\nrock.\n\n\nBut my problem is I can't get to the right kind of sound that I want\nto produce.\n\n\nMy amplifier can't produce the sound that I want, so it 's very\nfrustrating for me.\n\n\nHowever, there are three famous guitar amplifiers that are best for\neach kind of sound.\n\n\nThe Fender amplifier is best for clean tone.\n\n\nMost blues players and jazz players use Fender amp.  because it gives a clearer and bolder sound of the guitar.\n\n\nThey are able to produce bold sound of strings that Fender can only\nprovide.\n\n\nThe Marshall amplifier is best for distorted sound that most heavy\nmetal bands use.\n\n\nThe Marshall amp.  is known for its heaviness\nwhen it comes to distorted music.\n\n\nIt gives the player a wide variety of distorted sound that they can\nchoose from.\n\n\nThe Peavy amplifier is best for punk rock music because it gives the\npassive sound and the crunchiness that punks use. \n\n \n\nThese are the kinds of guitar amplifiers that best suit for\nblues, heavy metal, and punk rock.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "672fa4ae-0b3a-491c-8c8c-9dd5cc50bb6b", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.118530+00:00"}
{"text": "3. Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC) is a form of economic\nintegration where free trade is promoted because barriers to trade are\nremoved among member countries.\n\n\nArgument that although it would increase trade, the problem of income\ninequality among nationals of the different member countries will arise is\nfalse.\n\n\nAssuming that Heckscher-Ohlin model is used where it states that a\ncountry would export the commodity that intensively uses the relative\nabundant factors and imports the commodity that uses intensively the\nrelatively scarce factor of production.\n\n\nThe developed countries which are members of APEC are assumed to be\nthe capital abundant country and therefore exports capital-intensive goods\nwhile developing countries are the labor-abundant and exports the\nlabor-intensive good. \n\n \n\nUsing Heckscher-Ohlin as a take-off point, labor-abundant\ncountries would concentrate on the production of the labor-intensive good,\nthere will be an increase in demand for labor.\n\n\nThis increase in demand causes labor to become expensive therefore\nwages of labor increase, W/r or wage-rent ratio increases and K-L ratio\ndecreases. \n\n \n\nOn the other hand k-abundant countries would concentrate on the\nproduction of the k-intensive good and there will be an increased demand for\ncapital.\n\n\nCapital becomes expensive and the W/r ratio decreases and the K-L\nratio increases. \n\n \n\nThe increase in the W/r in the labor-abundant country is met by\nthe decrease in the W/r ratio in the k-abundant country.\n\n\nThese increases and decreases would stop until the factor prices\nequalize and therefore there is no question of income inequality because of\nfree trade.\n\n\nIncomes of labor-owners increases faster and capital owners ' income\nalso rises.  \n\n\n\n \n\n1. The advantages are: ( a) it is regular, meaning there is never\nor almost never a dearth in trade in services bec. there are always travel &\ntransport receipts and interest income generated from royalties, dividends,\n etc.  , and overseas remittances; ( b) it is predictable,\n e.g.  overseas remittances are highest in the months of\nNov. - Jan. and travel receipts are also periodic, so that one can estimate\nthe BOP inflow from this type of trade; ( c) it may imply the level of\nattractiveness of economic and social prospects in the country, tourism\npromotion is effective or not, ( d) and it may also imply the income\ngenerated by the surplus labor ( as in the case of the Phils.  ) ; ( e) it may reflect the level of factor abundance in\nlabor, as evidenced by OCW remittances.\n\n\nThe disadvantages are: ( a) it is intangible, therefore it is more\ndifficult to aggregate all the volume of trade in services and it may be open\nto procedural errors in calculating; ( b) it does not encourage merchandise\ntrade and export-promoting activities because it ignores the receipts earned\non exports; ( c) it encourages labor exports that may lead to exploitation of\nthem; ( d) it is not sustainable because it relies on tourism and labor\nprospects abroad that varies accdg. to the economic conditions of the\nlabor-importing countries; ( e) it is not conducive to growth within the\neconomy bec. it does not promote efficiency within the export sector by\nenhancing the competitiveness and increasing value-added in domestic\nproduction. \n\n \n\na.) If the exchange rate appreciates, the volume of inflows in\nterms of the currency of the labor-exporting/tourist-promoting country will\ndecrease.\n\n\nIf the ER depreciates, the volume will increase. \n\n \n\nb.) If there is perfect K mobility then there will be easier\naccess to money, money conversion will be more efficient and quicker, the\nvolume of inflows will increase bec. tourist receipts and labor remittances\nwill benefit from less bureaucracy and process payments. \n\n \n\nc.) If the level of world production increases, therefore BOP\ninflows involving trade in services will also experience an increase bec.\nlabor will be more demanded, and therefore will earn more, translates to\nhigher new remittances.\n\n\nTourist receipts will also increase bec. of higher incomes of\ntourists.  \n\n\n\n \n\nThe Samuelson theory of factor-price equalization is made under\nthe assumption that there are two countries ( A and B) involved in the trade,\nand that they export the good ( either X or Y) which they have comparative\nadvantage in.\n\n\nThis comparative advantage is determined by the factor abundance in\neach country.\n\n\nThe abundant factor is to be used intensively and the good which uses\nthe abundant factor would be exported.\n\n\nIt 's further assumed that countries A and B have different factor\nabundances and intensities.\n\n\nBoth countries will import the good <unclear> one word </unclear>\nuses his scarce resources intensively. \n\n \n\nThis theory of factor price equalization states that the prices\nof the factors of production will equalize because of trade between two\ncountries and that the incomes of the owners of the factor of production\nintensively used would increase faster than the incomes of the owners of the\nfactor of <unclear> two words </unclear> intensively used.\n\n\nTo explain the answer clearly, let me use the example of country A\nand B.\n\n\nCountry A exports X, a labor-intensive good, and imports Y, a capital\nintensive good.\n\n\nOn the other hand, country B exports Y ( K-intensive) and imports X (\nL- intensive).\n\n\nCountry B 's demand for X would increase W/r in country A because\nlabor becomes more expensive.\n\n\nThe same thing happens in country B, the price of the abundant factor\nK increases because of the demand from country A.\n\n\nHence, factor prices in both countries equalize. \n\n \n\nAccording to the theory, the incomes of the owners of the\nintensively used factor will rise at a faster rate than the owners of the\nother factor.\n\n\nThere won't be income inequality  if  the prices of the\nfactors are not discounted.\n\n\nThe Philippines is a labor abundant country, so expecting\nlabor-intensive goods would increase the incomes of the landless parties.\n\n\nThis would promote better income distribution.\n\n\nThe benefits a country would enjoy under the APEC would thus depend\non different domestic economic policies.\n\n\nSo, under Samuelson 's assumptions and arguments, I believe that the\nAPEC would help solve the problem of income inequality.\n\n\nBut to fully solve the problem entails changes in the country 's\npolitical and social structures as well as improvements in the government.\n \n\n\n\n \n\n3) The Philippines which is a developing country aims to become a\nnewly-industrialized country by the year 2000.\n\n\nIt plans in doing this by implementing numerous policies for economic\ndevelopment. \n\n \n\nThe government under the Ramos Administration is trying very hard\nto promote and give importance to small and medium scale industries.\n\n\nBecause these enterprises are relatively small, they are more easy to\nform thus capital needed to fund these firms will be minimal compared to\nlarge scale industries.\n\n\nThe source of funds for these projects will be from both public and\nprivate sectors.\n\n\nGovernment has instituted policies to give incentives to small and\nmedium scale enterprises ( SMEs).\n\n\nOne of these incentives is  Kalakalan  20 which aims\nto fund companies which employ 20 or less workers.\n\n\nAnother government policy is the  Magna Carta  or\nRH6977 which seeks to provide funds for starting small-time enterprises.\n\n\nGovernment banks like the LAND BANK and Philippine National Bank are\nobliged to provide credit to small enterprises which is mandated by law.\n\n\nTechnology plays a vital role in economic development.\n\n\nSince government is also promoting manufacturing firms because they\nproduce products or goods which have high value added, technology is\nobviously needed.\n\n\nGovernment is also trying hard to promote export industries.\n\n\nIt promotes these industries by giving the exemptions to these firms\nso as to entice more businessmen to go into industry. \n\n \n\nAlthough the Ramos administration has signalled its intention of\nhelping industries like manufacturing, export oriented, small and medium\nscale, it still needs to do more - - in the field of technology, there is\nlittle available source for firms which need technology.\n\n\nGovernment must provide technology and livelihood seminars to\nentrepreneurs that will be beneficial to the country as a whole.\n\n\nGovernment must promote college courses that provide education to\nfuture scientists so as to improve the state of technology in our country.\n \n\n\n\n \n\n( 1) A. Factors that influence industries to relocate to other\neconomies:\n\n\n( I) Since most industries try to lower its cost to gain higher\nprofits, it 's important for them to acquire the cheapest capital or labor (\nfactors of prod' n).\n\n\nThus, industries tend to exploit economies that have cheap labor or\ncapital.\n\n\n( 2) To further lessen their prod' n cost, industries prefer to\nlocate to places where lesser restrictions are imposed on them by <unclear>\none word </unclear> eco. meaning, lesser taxes on imported or tech. or raw\nmaterials, and also on their outputs makes eco. attracting to industries.\n\n\n( 3) Adequate provision of infrastructure ( ex. roads, elec., water,\n etc.  ) needed for prod' n will encourage industries to\nrelocate.\n\n\n( 4) Easy access to a large mkt. ( eco. w/ higher demand) increases\nthe probability of relocation.\n\n\n( 5) Lesser barriers to enter & exit an eco. influences industries to\nrelocate. \n\n\n B. Relationship or factors w/ that of  \" undesirable\nindustries &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nIt is unfortunate that the flexibility & leniency of some\neconomies with regards to the establishment of industries attract industries\nthat cause/contribute to social, environmental & economic problems.\n\n\nIt is because of the absence of restrictions ( in terms of policies &\nlegal procedures) that certain hazardous industries get away with the\nexploitation of an eco. abundant resources.\n\n\nAside from attaining the eco. goal of attracting industries to\nprovide more goods, services and employment, eco. also increased its\nproblems.\n\n\nFor instance, lesser laws regarding the environment means that\nindustries can just dump their wastes anywhere for there are no sanctions for\ntheir actions.\n\n\nIn short, industries are not required to abide by several legal\nprocedures before they can establish their factories.\n\n\nAs a consequence, people are affected because of the unhealthy\nenvironment brought about by these so-called industries. \n\n\n C. Policy Menu \n\n\nDue to the presence of these negative externalities, prices of output\ndo not reflect its true value and the output produced is below the\nequilibrium level.\n\n\nGiven these conditions, it is necessary for the govt. to impose taxes\nto these  \" undesirable industries &rdquo;  for the\nproblems it provided the eco.\n\n\nIn addition to this, the eco. should start implementing laws &\npolicies that will protect the environment and its people, and will hinder\n \" undesirable industries &rdquo;  from entering the\neco. with regards to the other industries, that are beneficial to the eco.\n\n\nSubsidies can be given to them to encourage them to expand their\noperations ( improve their products).  \n\n\n\n \n\n( 2) The developing economies of today are experiencing low\nlevels of growth.\n\n\nGrowth can be seen or measured in terms of the GNP of that developing\ncountry. \n\n \n\nDeveloping countries usually exhibit a common characteristic\namong them which are ( 1) low levels of living, ( 2) low productivity, ( 3)\nhigh and rising population rates, ( 4) high and rising unemployment rates,\nand ( 5) dependence on International Relations. \n\n \n\nHarrod-Domar model show us that changes in growth or GNP would\nequal the national savings ratio over the capital output ratio.\n\n\nThe national savings ratio is positively related to GNP while the\ncapital output ratio is inversely related. \n\n \n\nI. If the developing country would increase their savings and use\nit for investment that would yield good profits, the first condition, low\nlevels of living would improve.\n\n\nBrought about by increases in investments which would generate\nemployment, income can be generated especially if the type of investment is\nlabor augmenting. \n\n \n\nII. Low productivity can be improved with increases in\ninvestments, firms can invest in machineries that would produce economies of\nscale at lower costs. \n\n \n\nHigh and rising population rates may not be a problem\nanymore because of the need of a higher workforce for the economy ( assuming\nthat jobs created or investments created are labor generating). \n\n \n\nIV. High and rising unemployment rates would decrease because\nincreases in savings w/c brings higher funds for investment would create\nemployment in the industry.\n\n\nJobs will be created and the unemployed would decrease. \n\n \n\nV.

IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE EXCUSE? \n\n \n\nMan has no innate nature.\n\n\nMan creates himself.\n\n\nTherefore, it follows that man creates his own human nature and human\nfraility.\n\n\nWe are free individuals and this freedom condemns us to make choices\nall throughout our lives.\n\n\nThere are no eternal values we can adhere to which make our choices\neven more significant.\n\n\nWe are totally capable of everything we do.\n\n\nMan must never disclaim the responsibility that comes with the\nchoices he makes.\n\n\nMan must never blame human nature or human frailities because we are\nresponsible with the choices we make.\n\n\nFor example, in a boy-girl relationship.\n\n\nWhen the two broke-up.\n\n\nA friend asked the boy why they broke-up.\n\n\nThe boy said:  \" We just can't stand each other anymore\n&rdquo;  .\n\n\nThe friend asked:  \" why? &rdquo;  The boy\nanswered:  \" we just see our mistakes rather than the positive\nthings &rdquo;  .\n\n\nThe friend again asked:  \" Why? &rdquo;  the boy\nreplied:  \" well, we 're only human, born to make mistakes!\n&rdquo;  Existentialist doesn't accept that kind of excuse.\n\n\nHuman fraility is not an escape route where we can pass the blame\nonto.\n\n\nThe couple broke up because it was their choice.\n\n\nThey had problems because they choose not to find a solution but\nrather blame other things, think of other reasons why they broke up.  \n\n\nHOW DOES EXISTENTIALISM AFFECT MORAL DECISIONS? \n\n \n\nI think existentialism looks at the circumstances surrounding the\nissue before they decide what their decision should be.\n\n\nFor example, suicide.\n\n\nEveryone knows that suicide is wrong and sinful.\n\n\nIt is not accepted in our society because tradition tells us that\nsuicide is wrong.\n\n\nAn existentialist would look at the circumstance which lead to doing\nthe act.\n\n\nIf you take into consideration the movie \" Devil 's Advocate\n\" .\n\n\nKeanu Reeves committed suicide in the end because Al Pacino wanted\nhim to have sex with this woman and if they consumate, the birth of the devil\nwould take into place.\n\n\nThe woman needed Keanu 's semen for he is a half-child of Satan\nhimself.\n\n\nWhat would you do if you were in his case?\n\n\nYou have two choices, either you have sex and don't.\n\n\nBut having sex with the woman is not an option.\n\n\nSo, Keanu killed himself so that Satan 's plan of ruling the earth\nwill not take place. \n\n \n\nEveryone makes a choice that he believes would be for his own\ngood.\n\n\nThus, when a person makes a choice he believes that it is good for\nmankind.\n\n\nFor example, I choose to lie because I believe it is for my own good.\n\n\nTherefore, I must also take into consideration that if someone lies\nto me, it is okey because lying is good for mankind.\n\n\nBut not all the cases of lying is good.\n\n\nIt is not meant to be in general.\n\n\nWe must first look at the circumstances why lying occurred.  \n\n\nWHAT TO EXISTENTIALISM IS THE PROBLEM WITH A) DESTINY, B) GOD? \n\n \n\nA) The problem with destiny is that we can't control our lives.\n\n\n \" Essence before existence &rdquo;  which goes\nagainst existentialism which is  \" Existence before essence\n&rdquo;  .\n\n\nExistentialism believes that there is no ready-made essence or\nmission or purpose in life.\n\n\nWe make or create our own life.\n\n\nDestiny rebukes against that having destiny is having your life\ncreated for you.\n\n\nThat someone already planned your life and that you can never \"\nre-write &rdquo; your life.\n\n\nFor example, the story of \" Oedipus Rex \" , his\ndestiny was to kill his father and marry his mother.\n\n\nWhen the parents knew about this, they ordered to kill Oedipus.\n\n\nImagine, killing your own child.\n\n\nBut he wasn't killed instead, he was found by another King & Queen.\n\n\nTo cut the story short, he did kill his father and married his mother\nwhich was his destiny.\n\n\nEven if the father tried to \" re-write &rdquo; Oedipus ' life,\nhe still couldn't and neither could Oedipus because of destiny.\n\n\nWe can't control our live in destiny.\n\n\nWe 're just stage actors trying to follow a script that was already\nready-made for us.\n\n\nWe have no hold over our lives.\n\n\nWe 're just dummies. \n\n \n\nB) The writer of our script would be God.\n\n\nExistentialism tells us that God already planned our life.\n\n\nWe are free and if we are free, we are free to choose.\n\n\nHow can we be free if our own existence wasn't our own choice?\n\n\nDid anyone ask us if we wanted to live in this world?\n\n\nNo one.\n\n\nAnd yet we are free individuals.\n\n\nWe are condemned to choose, condemned to decide and condemned to be\nfree!  \n\n\n\n \n\n1. In existentialism, to exist means to stand up, to be unique\nand to be individuals.\n\n\nBut many of us choose to be just another face in the crowd, we choose\nto be anonymous, faceless egos.\n\n\nThese people who lose themselves to conformity and who do not stand\nup for what they believe in do not exist, according to existentialism.\n\n\nTo exist in the existential sense, we must know what we want to\nbecome and to be that kind of person.\n\n\nTo exist means we must search for our purpose in life and to fulfill\nit.\n\n\nIf we decide to just  \" go with the flow &rdquo;\n and to be just  \" one of the gang &rdquo;  then\nwe cease to exist.\n\n\nIn existentialism, to exist does not just mean to be physically\nalive, it is to live your life the way you want it, to be your true self.\n\n\nIf you sacrifice your identity to conformity, then you don't exist\nwhich many of us do today. \n\n \n\n2. The decision to be authentic is not a \" one-shot\n&rdquo; deal.\n\n\nWe cannot say,  \" I 've been authentic today, that\nmeans that until I die, I can call myself to be a true authentic &rdquo;\n .\n\n\nBeing authentic is a decision that has to be made everyday until we\ndie.\n\n\nIt has to be renewed each day.\n\n\nIt doesn't mean that if you 've been authentic today then you will\nbe authentic tomorrow.\n\n\nIt depends on us to decide to be authentic each day.\n\n\nIt is our choice to be authentic or not each day that we wake up.\n\n\nWe face many different situations in which we are called to be\nauthentic.\n\n\nIn each of these situations, we decide on whether we will become\nauthentic or not.\n\n\nWe will be judged to be authentic or not by the sum of the events\nthat have happened in our life, not just by one event. \n\n \n\n3. Human nature/fraility is not an acceptable excuse in\nexistentialism because in existentialism, existence preceded essence.\n\n\nWe are all created equal and it is up to us to find our own purpose\nin life.\n\n\nHuman nature/frailty is not an excuse because we have the power to\ndecide to be authentic, to be our true selves.\n\n\nIf we become weak, we have the power in us to be determined to be\nauthentic and to be strong. \n\n \n\nExistence precedes essence.\n\n\nThis means that we have no pre-determined destiny.\n\n\nWe have to make our own lives.\n\n\nIn existentialism, we were all created equal.\n\n\nHuman nature and fraility does not apply. \n\n \n\nExistentialism does not believe in God.\n\n\nTo believe in God is to believe that God created the first man as\nAdam and the first woman was Eve; when they ate the forbidden fruit, then\nthey doomed to live life in earth.\n\n\nIt was through Adam and Eve that man inherited his \" original\nsin\".\n\n\nWhen you believe in God then, you believe that men carry with them\nthe \" original sin &rdquo; that is why they experience frailty.\n\n\nIt is the human nature to be sinful because of this original sin .\n\n\nExistentialist do not believe in all these.\n\n\nWe have nothing to blame but ourselves because it is our own\ndecision. \n\n \n\n4. To be an existentialist is to be free but to be free and at\nthe same time being responsible.\n\n\nWe are responsible for the consequences of our decisions.\n\n\nTo be free also means to be responsible for the people who are\naffected by our decisions.\n\n\nIn addressing the issue of abortion, we would also consider the life\nof the fetus in our womb because our decision to abort or not to abort will\ndefinitely affect the baby in our womb.\n\n\nWe would think,  \" yes, this is my baby and I can do\nwhatever I want to do with it , but the baby inside me is another life.\n\n\nMy decision will affect this baby 's life\". \n\n\nWe become more responsible in our decision and we are considerate of\nthe lives of other people who are affected by our decision. \n\n \n\n5.a.) In existentialism, there is no destiny, these is no\npre-determined life for us.\n\n\nWe are created first and it is up to us to find our own purpose in\nlife.\n\n\n \" We make our destiny\"  .\n\n\nWe are the ones who plan our life.\n\n\nDestiny means that each one of us has a pre-defined purpose in life.\n\n\nIt means that our life is already planned w/c is not so in\nexistentialism.\n\n\nWe make our life, we are the ones who plans our life and decide what\nwill happen with it. \n\n \n\nb.) There is no GOD in existentialism.\n\n\nPeople who believe in GOD also believe in the devil.\n\n\nWe often blame him / pass the blame to him whenever that person\ncommits a mistake.\n\n\nWe often say,  \" The devil tempted me &rdquo; \nwhenever we succumb.\n\n\nTo believe in God means to believe that there is heaven and there is\nhell.\n\n\nYou will go to one of these places often you die.\n\n\nBut in existentialism, there is no heaven or hell.\n\n\nIt is not concerned with the after-life.\n\n\nIt is concerned with our life now, at the moment, at the present.\n\n\nTo believe in God means that when you die and had been good during\nyour life on earth, then you will enter God 's kingdom and have eternal life.\n\n\nExistentialism does not touch on the After-life.\n\n\nIt has no God.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f7377ac3-8a1f-4433-a43e-1da791e8f081", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.121031+00:00"}

E. Cummings, another patronizer of the free verse, is a\nmodernist poet who capitalized on the use of satire in his poems. \n\n \n\ne) Allen Ginsberg is one of the contemporary poets who uses free\nverse and protests as the tone of his poems.\n\n\nHis topics would usually include issues like those of social unrest,\npolitics and others.  \n\n \n\n2. Discuss extensively one period in the literary history of\nAmerican Literature.\n\n\nGive emphasis on the writers, the subject matter, theme of the works\nof that period and the events that contributed to the development of American\nLiterature.  \n\n\n The Literature of the New World ( 1400-1600) \n\n \n\nThe literary works during this period consists of journals,\ndiaries and autobiographical notes about the explorations made and the\nadventures of the people involved in the expeditions. \n\n \n\nAmerigo Vespucci and Christopher Columbus ' accounts, for\nexample, differ in the way they presented their texts.\n\n\nColumbus is more specific with scientific details.\n\n\nHis primary purpose was to fulfill and prove his \" small earth\ntheory &rdquo; derived from his readings of Ptolemy.\n\n\nHe endeavored to reach the West Indies, though he wasn't aware that\nhe had already discovered \" America. &rdquo;\n\n\nHis presentation was more objective and theoretical compared to\nVespucci 's which was more subjective ( Vespucci called the natives \"\nuncivilized, &rdquo; barbarians and the like).\n\n\nThus, Vespucci 's and Columbus ' work did not really explicitly\nattempted to arrive at a more literary text, rather, they were compelled by\nthe necessity to discover, explore, and later expand the territories of their\nmotherland. \n\n \n\nOn the other hand, the coming of Capt. John Smith 's accounts\nposed a challenge to the earlier works of Vespucci and Columbus.\n\n\nHis was purely based on experience, and his portrayal of Pocahontas '\npeople and land was more vivid and descriptive.\n\n\nSmith also introduced the concept of a new hero by placing himself as\nthe protagonist of a romantic adventure in the wilderness.\n\n\nThe issue of whether one is civilized or not, was in fact, put aside.\n\n\nSmith 's account seemed more like \" selling &rdquo; the land to\nthe colonizers.\n\n\nHe focused on the advantages and things which they can gain from the\nnatives.  \n\n \n\n3. Discuss the dilemma/conflict of the modern man as presented\nin: A) ____, B) ____, C)____, D)____, E)____.  \n\n\n a) A Clean and Well Lighted Place \n\n \n\nThe protagonist in the story is torn in conflict between the\nyoung and old generation, when the ways of the young is now becoming a potent\nforce in their time, and the old needs to succumb to the changes, but is\nstuck with their old ways. \n\n\n b) Of Mice and Men \n\n \n\nLenny and George are examples of those who aspire to live a\nsimple and friendly life.\n\n\nThey are one of those few people who value companionship despite the\nharsh realities of living - particularly that of getting a job, earning and\nsaving in the hope of achieving their dream of owning a house, and garden\nwhere they can plant and harvest their own food and a place where they can\nraise a few animals and Lenny can raise rabbits.\n\n\nOnce in a awhile, their co-workers would discourage them and persuade\nthem to give up their dream (  What they 're trying to achieve is only\nan illusion, they 'd forever stay as poor as a mice).\n\n\nTheir strength and trust in each other remains their only shield\nagainst all odds ( Lenny would tell George that they 've always got each\nother, and that 's what 's important). \n\n\n c) Hands \n\n \n\nMr. Harper is a man who is inherently good, of good moral\ndisposition but at times is being forced by his own \" hands &rdquo; (\nas if they 've a mind of their own) to commit things he tries desperately to\navoid.\n\n\nYet it is evident that although he was being forced by his \"\nhands &rdquo; to do things he don't want to, he managed to \" tame\n&rdquo; them as best as he could by diverting them to some productive and\nuseful work in the fields. \n\n\n d) The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky \n\n \n\nThe sudden change in the Marshal 's attitude and behavior was due\nto his marriage with a girl from another place.\n\n\nHe broke the tradition of informing his people about the marriage,\nand became more calm in facing a dilemma ( that of a challenge posed by his\nrival).\n\n\nHe no longer carried his cowboy image upon his return, but he seemed\nto have surrendered the typical characteristics a more refined man. \n\n\n e) The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn \n\n \n\nHuck Finn is an example of a  picaro  .\n\n\nThis lad was torn between the issue of being \" civilized\n&rdquo; or not, of which he chose the latter.\n\n\nHe is a boy governed by his common sense, conscience and good nature.\n\n\nIn his adventures with the Negro slave Jim, Huck endeavored to help\nreunite Jim with his family.\n\n\nThus, he recognized the value of equality by treating Jim as an\nequal.  \n\n \n\n4. Discuss the novel/play assigned to you for term paper in\nterms of:\n\n\na) insights about the different literary periods in American\nLiterature\n\n\nb) your knowledge of the author\n\n\nc) what makes it American\n\n\nd) your knowledge of what literature is\n\n\ne) could it be one of the greatest literary works in American lit.?\n \n\n \n\nIt will be unfair to consider that every literary article one\nreads is the greatest or one of the greatest literary work in any particular\nliterature.\n\n\nIt is to my opinion that this is quite subjective in the sense that\nthere will always be the question of the criteria to be considered in judging\na work to determine its greatness. \n\n \n\nMy term paper \" The Sound and the Fury \" was\nwritten during the Modernist period.\n\n\nThe style adopted by Faulkner is experimental and his use of the\nstream of consciousness in presenting the novel gave me a new insight on how\nto present a novel in a different perspective.\n\n\nBut there are difficulties that one many encounter in reading the\ntext - his use of four narrators for every chapter ( the idiot Benjy,\nQuentin, Jason, and the author himself) could prove confusing if the reader\nwill make the futile mistake of ignoring the details.\n\n\nFurthermore, the text also calls a little background knowledge about\nthe  milieu  and life of the author.\n\n\nFaulkner is fond of using his native Southern hometown as setting.\n\n\nHe also mentioned Col. Sartoris, whom he patterned after the life of\nhis great great grandfather Col. Falkner.\n\n\nHis anti-traditional views and the conflict between two philosophical\nviews - humanism and naturalism, are to some critics reflected in his works.\n\n\n \n\nI must confess that the novel might require a few more sittings\nto be able to understand it better.\n\n\nNevertheless, I consider the novel an attempt to come up with a\nmimetic portrayal of life in the South.\n\n\nThe culture and beliefs practiced, the way each character spoke, and\nhow the setting was portrayed reflect the way the people in the South lived.\n\n\nIn fact, the author 's raw material for his novel was purely\nAmerican, there was almost no mention of foreign influence, but only that of\nAmerican living.  \n\n \n\n5. Discuss the themes and issues discussed in the literary works\nof Puritan America and those of Contemporary America.  \n\n \n\nThe literary works of Puritan America centered on the spiritual\naspects of American life.\n\n\nThe Puritans were more concerned about moral reformation,\npurification of the soul and the teachings of the bible.\n\n\nThe writings were also heavily influenced by deism and Calvinism.\n\n\nThey are didactic and focused on the improvement of the relationship\nbetween God and man.\n\n\nExamples of these are William Bradford 's \" Of Plymouth\nPlantation \" ( the Pilgrims attempt to create a new Jerusalem apart\nfrom the materialistic utopia propagated by others), and \" Sinners in\nthe Hands of an Angry God \" ( where sinners are being encouraged to\nrepent while there 's still time). \n\n \n\nContemporary American, on the other hand, produced more liberal\nliterary works.\n\n\nWriters still continued to experiment in form and style but centered\nprimarily on politics, social and economic issues and others.\n\n\nThey focused more on how to improve society and the planet and not\nmuch on the moral side.  \n\n \n\n \n\n8. Compare and contrast the characteristics of the literature of\n Colonial America  and that of  Post War America  . \n\n\n \n\nLiterature during the Colonial America were written based from\nthe experiences of the writer, that 's why it was called as the Literature of\nexperience and sometimes with imagination.\n\n\nBecause writers then were just starting to explore the art of\nwriting, simple and uncomplicated themes such as family relations, life in\nthe wilderness, marriage, native Indians, slaving were just presented.\n\n\nLiterary works written then were very simple, but most of the time\nthey were didactic or sermonizing.\n\n\nWhile during the Post War America, certain changes took place in the\nliterature world.\n\n\nThe writers then were greatly affected by the wars like, World War I,\nand II, Korean and Vietnam war and the Hiroshima bombing that 's why the\nthemes or subject matter of their works were also changed.\n\n\nSocial injustices, liberalism, freedom, equality, war became the most\nwritten themes.\n\n\nWriters also tried to experiment on the different ways of writing.\n\n\nExperimentation on form and style.\n\n\nLiterature during the Post War America were also called as the\n\" \" literature of protest &rdquo; \" , because writers\nthen tried to call the attention of the people to present to them the\ndestructive or hazardous effects of war to mankind.  \n\n \n\nDiscuss the dilemma/conflict of modern man as presented in: a)\n____, b) ____, c) ____, d) ____, and e) ____.\n\n\n \n\n \n\nIn \" \" A Clean Well-Lighted Place &rdquo;\n\" the dilemma or conflict encountered by the modern man was the\nquest for the  real essence  or  meaning  of life.\n\n\nHere, the young and the old waiter were used to present the\ndifference on how two men with different situations in life view life.\n\n\nThe young waiter sees life in a very \" hurrying &rdquo; way.\n\n\nAs he hurries to go home to his family, it was described that because\nhe has something to care for, he sees life in a positive way while the old\nwaiter who doesn't have a family or anyone to care for sees life as a waste,\nthat there 's nothing in this life.\n\n\nSeems like man is just living to wait for his death. \n\n \n\nIn \" \" Hands &rdquo; \" the conflict was\nabout the inability of the \" man &rdquo; to face the troubles in the\nsociety.\n\n\nIt 's like Man vs. Society, here Mr. Biddlebaum, the teacher, fled\nto another place for he failed to seek justice or defend himself. \n\n \n\nIn \" \" Of Mice and Men &rdquo; \" the\nconflict was about the struggle of the main characters to cope with life, to\nseek ways in order to live a better life.\n\n\n\n \n\nIn \" \" The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky &rdquo;\n\" the conflict was about man 's struggle to change his way of life\nby forgetting or getting rid of his old ways of living. \n\n \n\nIn \" \" The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn &rdquo;\n\" the conflict here lies in Huck Finn 's refusal to adopt to the\nmodern way of living such as going to school or getting educated, wearing\nslippers or shoes or being civilized.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "7c520bae-ac0a-45b6-8d02-80e86e4b590c", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.122223+00:00"}

In doing sociolinguistic fieldwork, a researcher must be\nconscious of, among other things, a couple of ethical concerns such as 1) the\nrole the researcher plays and 2) the purpose in doing the study.\n\n\nThe researcher shld. only take on a role that s/he feels natural about\nand does not go against his/her principles.\n\n\nAlso, the purpose of the study may be given/revealed to the subjects\nonly insofar as it helps in eliciting the necessary information.\n\n\nResearcher needs to stay as close to the truth as possible w/o\nrevealing all details of study. \n\n \n\n2. The Agutaynens love their language no matter what the other\nmembers of the community feel about it or despite the fact that it does not\nhave the same prestige as Cuyonon or Tagalog or English.\n\n\nAgutaynen is regarded as a \" \" LOW &rdquo; \"\nlanguage; Cuyonon as \" Middle \" ; Tagalog as \" High\n\" and English as \" Dummy High \" . \n\n \n\n3. The \" matched guise technique \" focuses on\nthe  language used  and not on the speakers so that for ex., 3\nspeakers may be utilized to speak 6 different passages in 2 languages.\n\n\nThis technique allows the \" hearers &rdquo; to assume that\nthere are 6 diff. speakers thus, eliminating any biases they ( subjects) may\nhave about the speakers ' nationality.\n\n\nSo they may focus on proficiency and language prestige. \n\n\n02 Feb. 2002 \n\n\n1.

A major rule in conversation has been called by Fasold as the\n\"  \" no gap, no overlap &rdquo;  \"\nrule; show why Coates rejected it for her all-female conversation data. \n\n \n\n1. In terms of address in American English, when two adults\n<delete> fir </delete> initially address each other, they start out with last\nnames.\n\n\nAs they progress in their acquaintance or as they know each other\nlonger, the person of the higher status initiates in calling or addressing\nthe person of lower status by using the first name.\n\n\nWith time and familiarity the two may progress to FN basis.\n\n\nBut it is always the person of the higher status who is the\ngatekeeper in <delete> the use of </delete> the term of address to use. \n\n \n\n2. Labov found out that <delete> the </delete> social\nstratification determined how ( r) was pronounced.\n\n\nThose from the upper socio-econ. status ( Saks 5th Ave.) had marked (\nr-1) pronunciation while those from Kleins had ( r-0).\n\n\nPeople who went to Macys representing the middle were aware of the\nmarked ( and prestigious) ( r) and would approximate the desired\npronunciation in the emphatic mode. \n\n \n\n3. Misinterpretation between Koreans and African-Americans\nrecurred because of cultural misunderstanding about how each showed respect\nto the other.\n\n\nThe Korean shop owners/cashier showed restraint involvement in their\ninteraction - - not wanting to impose upon the other, while African-Americans\nshowed involvement politeness or positive face focusing on interaction and\nsmall talk.\n\n\n\n \n\n4. In all-female interaction, the \"  \" no\ngap, no overlap rule &rdquo;  \" is violated as seen in the\nmany instances of simultaneous speech.\n\n\nThese \" overlaps &rdquo; happen as a result of or because of\nthe participants' eagerness to join in the conversation.\n\n\nRather than being seen as competing to take the floor, it is seen as\ncontributing to the discussion and the building of social interaction. \n\n\n09 Feb. 2002 \n\n\n1. Discuss one conclusion that Trudgill arrived at in his study of\nBritish pop-song pronunciation.\n\n\n2. Edwards found an interaction between social class and sex in\nchildren 's speech.\n\n\nWhat is this interaction? \n\n \n\n1. Trudgill asserts that people tend to approximate the\npronunciation of the \" standard\", in this case American, in their\nsinging even if in their natural speech, they don't sound that way.\n\n\nOne reason could be because the British pop singers ' target market\nis American and so the singers would attempt to sound like them.\n\n\nThis shows a case of linguistic insecurity.\n\n\nBut over time, as in the case of the Beatles, once they have \"\narrived &rdquo; the singers sounded more like they would naturally, and so\ndid not have to approximate the \" standard &rdquo; because they had\nachieved their security, linguistically and otherwise. \n\n \n\n2. Acdg. to Edwards <delete> young children </> middle class\nspeech tended to sound more polite, more correct, more like the traditional\nstandard, thus more feminine.\n\n\nOn the other hand, working class speech was perceived to be rougher\nand more masculine.\n\n\nThis was true even for young children who it seemed even at their\nage, had already absorbed social norms on sex and social class.\n\n\nThus, WC girls were mistaken for boys and MC boys were mistaken for\ngirls. \n\n\n16 Feb. 2002 \n\n\n1. Joos says that English has five style levels.\n\n\nWhat are the five styles?\n\n\nCharacterize one of those styles.\n\n\n2. In what way is P. Fishman justified in titling her article,\n \" Interaction: The work women do &rdquo;  ?\n\n\n3. Freed & Greenwood debunk some of Fishman 's claims.\n\n\nDiscuss one claim of Fishman and the refutation provided by Freed &\nGreenwood. \n\n \n\n1. The five styles according to Joos are: \" Intimate,\nCasual, Consultative, Formal and Frozen \" .\n\n\n\" Intimate style \" is one used by interlocutors who\nshare much background information and are very familiar with each other, as\nmarried couples would be.\n\n\nSo familiar would they be that a mere word uttered between them would\nbe easily understood. \n\n \n\n2. The title Fishman used reflects the generalization she makes\nabout who does more work and carries the load in interaction.\n\n\nThey do the  \" shit work &rdquo;  in\nconversation, maintaining, supporting, and continuing it.\n\n\nDespite doing much of the work, though, Fishman contends that it is\nstill the men who are in control. \n\n \n\n3. Freed and Greenwood refute Fishman 's finding that women ask\nmore questions in conversation to get the men to interact.\n\n\nIn Freed 's and Greenwood 's view, both men and women use this device\nin comparable frequency.\n\n\nRather than attributing the frequency of question use to gender and\npower relationships, it is the context that also <delete> plays </delete>\ncomes into play.\n\n\nIn this case, men and women are more alike than different. \n\n\n23 Feb. 2002 \n\n\n1. Discuss how the behavior of women in Oberwart is contributing to\nthe loss of speakers of Hungarian in the community.\n\n\n2. Why does Eckert find the use of sex as a variable in\nsociolinguistic ( variation) studies unsatisfactory? \n\n \n\n1. The women in Oberwart use German more often ( even when their\ninterlocutors speak Hungarian) to signal their rejection of the lifestyle\nthat Hungarian represents.\n\n\nHungarian is associated with the peasants while German is associated\nwith the worker.\n\n\nBecause of this behaviour women tend to look for men who speak German\n( and thus more prestigious).\n\n\nThe peasant men, meantime, have to look outside their immediate\ncommunity to women who will not reject their peasant status.\n\n\nHowever, the women outside Oberwart more likely than not would be\nGerman speaking.\n\n\nSo the twin effects contribute to the loss of Hungarian in the\ncommunity. \n\n \n\n2. Acdg. to Eckert, \" sex \" refers to the\nbiological differentiation in people that tends to be seen as binary\nopposites.\n\n\n\" Gender \" would be a richer, more varied variable\nsince it would take into account other factors as situational context and\nother sociological aspects. \n\n\n02 March 2002 \n\n\n1. Explain/exemplify Frake 's observation that in the adjectives of\nZamboangue&ntilde;o, the unmarked forms are Spanish and the marked forms are\nPhilippine.\n\n\n2. Describe how a pidgin develops and how a creole develops from a\npidgin.\n\n\n3. Discuss the explanation that Bautista offers for why we\ncode-switch and mention two kinds of evidence she presents from her data.\n\n\n \n\n1. The unmarked forms in Zm. are in Spanish and thus suggest that\nthe bigger, older, masculine, more prestigious adjectives are used.\n\n\nThe Phil. forms are exemplified as  putot  ( small),\nSp. forms as  claro  .\n\n\nThus, it seems Sp. is  and Phil. is  . \n\n \n\n2. A pidgin develops when two groups of speakers who speak two\ndistinct languages come in contact with each other.\n\n\nThese 2 groups find ways of communicating with each other.\n\n\nA pidgin develops into a creole when a number of people speaking it\nincrease.\n\n\nThis is the case of Chabacano. \n\n \n\n3. Bautista says that we code-switch because of 1) proficiency\nand 2) deficiency.\n\n\nWhen speakers possess full mastery of two languages, they CS easily\nbetween these languages for convenience.\n\n\nOn the other hand, when speakers are learning a new language or are\nnot sufficiently knowledgeable about the terms ( as in the case of our\nstudents) they also CS. \n\n\n09 March 2002 \n\n\n1. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis concerns the relationship between\nlanguage and worldview/culture.\n\n\nExplain the hypothesis in your own words.\n\n\n2. In what ways are Polish compliments different from American\ncompliments?\n\n\n3. Agar suggests a way of seeing bilingualism in terms of \n\" culture continuous rather than discrete, partial rather than\ncomplete, relative to the situation of contact rather than independent.\n&rdquo; \n\n\nExplain. \n\n \n\n1. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis maintains that language influences\nthe worldview.\n\n\nSo that in Whorf 's example of the  empty drums  , people\ntend to behave carelessly around it thinking that the word \" \nempty  \" makes the situation safe.\n\n\nIn his study of the Hopi culture, Whorf found certain concepts (\n e.g.  time) that were viewed differently from SAE.\n\n\nIn this \" strong view &rdquo; he formulated, he seemed to\nsuggest that languages were impossible to translate into others. \n\n \n\n2. Polish compliments have free word order whereas American\ncompliments have fixed word order such as NP + Adj.\n\n\nAnother difference is that the Polish tend to reject or downplay the\ncompliment received while Americans are more accepting.\n\n\nAlso, American compliments are more about personal qualities ( looks,\nhair, ability) while the Polish focus on material possessions. \n\n \n\n3. Learning a language and becoming communicatively competent in\nit requires that one must take into account the culture.\n\n\nLanguage <delete> and culture </delete> must be learned within its\nculture and not learned independently of it.\n\n\nA language learner approximates L1 mastery when s/he is able to\ngrasp the nuances of meaning of  \" rich points &rdquo; \nfound in the lang. & culture.  \n\n\n\n \n\nTo be sixteen...\n\n\nWhat was it like?... \n\n \n\nBeing sixteen for me, was actually a turning point in my life\nwhere I had to learn the hardships of drastic change and crisis.\n\n\nThis was the year after I got fished out of my home to live in the\nheat of Manila.\n\n\nSo sudden was the transition from a perfect childhood to a\ntreacherous adolescence that I was forced to grow up faster than most of my\nage. \n\n \n\nWhen I was sixteen I wore my hair down and let me be me.\n\n\nI was discovering that all I had known to be safe and true was gone\nand I had to start all over again.\n\n\nI remember missing my friends; missing a place called the bamboo\nforest - a tiny patch of clearing in the middle of a bamboo forest.\n\n\nWhenever the gray walls and sticky heat of the city pestered me I 'd\nclose my eyes and bring myself back into that place.\n\n\nI could see Walter, Frankie, Paolo, Richard, Warren and Marzy\nsitting together, a pack of smiling faces staring at the graceful dance of\nthe sunlight as it bounced to and from the shiny bamboo. \n\n \n\nSixteen was when I had to put on my first school uniform, I had\nto comb my hair and keep inside what I felt about the world.\n\n\nI had to try and find friendship in a place I thought impossible and\nI spent the whole of my crazy adolescence finding belongingness in a strange\ncity place. \n\n \n\nSixteen was also when boys didn't just want to play football\nwith me but tried to hold my hand.\n\n\nSixteen was also the time when I finally looked at myself and asked\n \" Who are you?\"  ,  \" What do you want?\n&rdquo;  and  \" Can you be strong enough to be happy?\".\n \n\n \n\nI don't think being sixteen ever ends for me.\n\n\nAll I know is that 's when it all began.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "75f50486-597f-4298-858e-2609a203198b", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.123399+00:00"}

What type of adaptation was used in \"  Age of\nInnocence  \" ?\n\n\nMake specific references from the texts. \n\n \n\n1. a. \" \" Clash of the Titans &rdquo; \" (\nmovie) presented Perseus as a ready-made hero.\n\n\nHe takes on the adventure willingly and performs his heroic deeds\nwell.\n\n\nAlthough in its written form he had different reasons in taking on the\nchallenge.\n\n\n\" \" Prisoner of Zenda &rdquo; \" ( movie)\npresented Rasendyll as a reluctant hero.\n\n\nHis reasons for entering the adventure was the same as in the novel.\n\n\nBut his make-up as a hero is different.\n\n\nIn the novel, he learns how to be a hero even though he wasn't one in\nthe start.\n\n\nBut in the novel, he might have been reluctant but he approved to be\na closeted hero.\n\n\nHe didn't learn to be anything in the film. \n\n \n\nb. \" \" Clash of the Titans &rdquo; \" (\nmovie) in its adventure plot had all the monsters that would sell well.\n\n\nHowever, the journey Perseus took was for the love of Andromeda,\nwhich was not the case in its written form.\n\n\n\" \" The Prisoner of Zenda &rdquo; \" ( movie)\nmeanwhile, Rasendyll took on the adventure because he felt it was his duty.\n\n\nIt 's the same thing in the novel.\n\n\nIt also had the mean characters, which could be compared with the\nmonsters in \" \" Clash of the Titans &rdquo; \" .\n\n\nBoth defeat the monsters but only Perseus gets the girl for all\neternity. \n\n \n\nc. In \" \" Clash of the Titans &rdquo; \" (\nmovie & written form) the characters were at the mercy of the gods.\n\n\nOne could only do as much as the gods allow him to.\n\n\nIn \" \" Prisoner of Zenda &rdquo; \" , fate has\nit that Rasendyll looked like the king.\n\n\nBut Rasendyll was free to choose his path and so was Flavia.\n\n\nThey had their free will.\n\n\nPerseus & Andromeda performed according to their fate and didn't\nchoose any other path. \n\n \n\n2. \" \" Age of Innocence &rdquo; \" used\nfaithful adaptation in transferring the novel into film.\n\n\nEverything was faithful to every detail.\n\n\nFor example, when Ellen told Archer <delete> that </delete> \n\" I can not love you unless I give you up\"  , it was found in\nthe movie.\n\n\nAnd when Archer told his son  \" Just tell her I 'm old\nfashioned\"  , it was also found in the film.\n\n\nThe only minor alterations the film had was the condensation of 2\nchapters [ when Archer 's boss gave Archer Ellen 's divorce case] and the\naddition of an unseen character as a narrator.\n\n\nIt was done in a voice over but it was still faithful to the text.\n \n\n\n\n \n\n1. a. Both Perseus and Rudolf Rassendyll are considered heroes,\nthough defined by societies delineated from one another by centuries.\n\n\nPerseus was the conventional Greek hero who, having won the favors of\nthe gods from the very beginning, was destined to triumph over every obstacle\nwith the aid of divine intervention; while Rudolf Rassendyll was more of a\nchivalric knight, who won over his enemies aided not by any intervention from\nany god, but armed only with wit, skill in the battlefield and nobility of\nintention. \n\n \n\nb. Perseus and Rudolf Rassendyll faced obstacles for love and\nhonor; but while the former battled mythological creatures and monsters for\nthe love of his life, Rudolf fought the metaphorical green-eyed monster\n\" jealousy \" , together with treachery and greed, to save\nthe princess Flavia from the fiendish machinations of Black Michael, and for\nthe restoration of peace and order over all of Ruritania.\n\n\nBoth heroes triumphed, although Perseus enjoyed divine aid from the\nvery onset of his adventures, whereas Rudolf relied on no god, but on\ntrustworthy friends alone. \n\n \n\nc. Fate was present in both stories: Perseus was destined to\ntriumph over every obstacle with divine aid, whereas Rudolf was fated to be a 'play-acting'\nking for a limited span of time for him to learn the value of responsibility.\n\n\nHowever, the concept of free will was  most  evident in\n\" \" The Prisoner of Zenda. &rdquo; \"\n\n\nRudolf had the choice of keeping the <delete> throne </delete> crown\nwhen the opportunities presented themselves, but being noble in character\n opted  to save the real king even at the expense of his own love\nfor the princess Flavia.\n\n\nPerseus had no opportunity to exercise free will, for his life was\nalready charted out for him, from his birth, subsequent suffering, to\neventual triumph. \n\n \n\n2. Basing on Louis Gianetti 's classification of adaptations,\nMartin Scorsese used the faithful adaptation in his filmic rendering of the\nnovel \" \" The Age of Innocence. &rdquo; \"\n\n\nAside from the minor intervention of fusing 2 chapters into one\nsequence with fluidity, every aspect of the novel was retained: the setting,\nthe costumes, the characterizations, even the beauty of language.  \n\n\n\n \n\n1. a. In \" \" The Clash of the Titans &rdquo;\n\" the hero was depicted as one of noble standard; one who was\nhandsome, strong and of high social stature.\n\n\nIn \" \" The Prisoner of Zenda &rdquo; \" the\nhero was a simpleton whose character evolved during the course of the story.\n\n\n \n\nb. \" \" The Clash of the Titans &rdquo; \" 's\nplot was composed of <delete> a </delete> long journeys, magical elements and\nthe rescue of a damsel in distress.\n\n\nIn \" \" The Prisoner of Zenda &rdquo; \" the\naction and adventure mostly happened within the protagonist, with his journey\nfrom being one kind of person to the others, battling what is right and what\nis wrong with himself. \n\n \n\nc. \" \" The Clash of the Titans &rdquo; \"\nshowed the dominance of the Olympian gods and goddesses over the fate of\nhumans, with them literally transporting them from one place to another.\n\n\n\" \" The Prisoner of Zenda &rdquo; \" showed\nhumans having free will to choose what to do, examples of which being\nRasendyll 's decision to impose as the king, and his decision to leave\neverything behind in the end of the story. \n\n \n\n2. I would say that <delete> transposition faithful adaptation\n</delete> \" paraphrasing \" was used for \" \"\nThe Age of Innocence &rdquo; \" .\n\n\nSome minor events from the novel were taken out, one example being\nhow the novel described Newland purchasing May her daily <delete> flo\n</delete> daisies but also purchasing Ellen a huge bouquet of yellow roses.\n\n\nThis depicts the slow yet evident change in Newland with regards to\nhis feelings towards the two ladies.\n\n\nYet the film only showed Ellen finding the bouquet of roses.\n\n\nThis scene did show how Newland 's feelings toward Ellen were\nchanging, yet it did not show how these feelings were surpassing his feelings\nfor May, which the purchasing of the two very different sets of flowers\nshowed.\n\n\nThe author 's idea was still presented, though some alterations were\nmade.\n\n\nThese two types of presentation, though different in several aspects,\nboth showed the key idea of Newland 's increasing feelings toward Ellen. \n\n\n\n\n \n\n1. a. The hero in the \" Prisoner of Zenda \" is\nsomewhat, a part of the  ordinary citizenry  of the country who, due\nto unsystematic events with a touch of fate, made him  \" save\nthe ass &rdquo;  of the soon-to-be-king.\n\n\nHis role entails great pretensions so as to convince the people that\nhe truly is the king, and not a fraud.\n\n\nIn this case, there is chivalry shown by the man named \"\nRudolf \" .\n\n\nIn the \" Clash of the Titans \" , the hero named\n\" Perseus \" is a son of the powerful god - Zeus.\n\n\nHe is therefore part of the ruling class where in most of his\nadventures, the gods and goddesses were aiding him. \n\n \n\nb. Both of the two films have a cause and effect relationship.\n\n\nBoth made use of the constructed plot of the two narratives.\n\n\nThere is the capture of the hero, escape ad adventure of the hero,\njourney and triumph in achieving his goal.\n\n\nOf course, the two films have a conflict, climax, and resolution to\nthe conflict.\n\n\nHowever, in \" Clash of the Titans \" , happy ending\nbetween Perseus and Andromeda took place.\n\n\nA sadder ending was shown in \" Prisoner of Zenda \" .\n\n\n \n\nc. Fate has played a very important role in the development of\nthe two literary works/films.\n\n\nFate brought <delete> by </delete> the exact look-alike of Rudolf (\nin \" Prisoner of Zenda \" ) to his mansion where he will\npretend to be the enthroned king.\n\n\nIn \" The Clash of the Titans \" , the gods dictated\nthe fate of Andromeda.\n\n\nMost of what happened to him was caused by his \" invisible\n&rdquo; allies as well as by those who are jealous of him.\n\n\nFree will is visible in the hero of \" Prisoner of Zenda\n\" when he decided to pretend as the king.\n\n\nAll his actions, though restricted, are controlled by him alone.\n\n\nThe volition of <delete> Cla </delete> Perseus in \" Clash of\nthe Titans \" are somewhat not firm.\n\n\nDue to ignorance ( caused by isolation), he needed to ask for advice\nfrom the more knowledgeable.\n\n\nBut in loving Andromeda, his free will manifested many heroic\nactions. \n\n \n\n2. \" Age of Innocence \" made use of \"\n faithful adaptation  \" .\n\n\nMost parts of the novel were shown in the film although some parts\nwere not included.\n\n\nHowever, having not included some parts didn't cause a major\nalteration to the story.\n\n\nAn example is the deletion of the setting where a party in the\nMinggot 's mansion was taking place.\n\n\nSome parts were modified like when Archer Newland and Olenska were\nhaving an intense conversation with each other, disclosing their feeling\ntowards one another.\n\n\nIn the film, the emotions were intense but a sense of exaggeration\nwas evident.  \n\n\n\n \n\n1. a. Perseus is son of the supreme god Zeus and being so, the\ngod intervenes in Perseus ' struggles.\n\n\nPerseus is an ideal Greek hero - - noble, strong, & handsome.\n\n\nRasendyll, on the other hand, is more of an \" accidental\n&rdquo; hero.\n\n\nHis incredible physical resemblance to the crown prince initiates his\n\" hero-ship &rdquo; or heroism. \n\n \n\nb. Perseus is tasked to kill the gorgon Medusa to save the life\nof his lady love Andromeda.\n\n\nRasendyll is set, on the other hand, to assure that the throne will\nnot befall the evil hands of the king 's brother, Michael.\n\n\nPerseus ' adventure is supernatural as he battles monsters and\nbefriends magical creatures, while Rasendyll 's is a \" cloak-and-dagger\n&rdquo; battle. \n\n \n\nc. Perseus is an incidental hero.\n\n\nBeing a son of Zeus, he is assured a rather good life.\n\n\nZeus ' quarrel with Tethys spelled his quest to face one day\nCallibus, the goddess ' son, and all these happen bec. of \" heaven 's\n&rdquo; hands.\n\n\nRasendyll made the bold decision to play \" King &rdquo; and he\nhad the sole will to go which way. \n\n \n\n2. The movie adaptation is a rather \" artful &rdquo; and\nfaithful one precisely because it sticked to the novel 's course of events.\n\n\nThe narration provided depth to the film as it served as an \"\n\" interior monologue &rdquo; \" .\n\n\nIf ever there were omissions & deletions, it still favors the goal of\nthe adaptation to sustain the subtlety of the actions in the novel.  \n\n\n\n \n\n1. a. Perseus the hero of \" \" Clash of the Titans\n&rdquo; \" , and Rassendyll, hero of \" \" The Prisoner\nof Zenda &rdquo; \" , both have heroic qualities such as bravery,\nword of honor, code of duty as shown in their adventures.\n\n\nThe difference is that, Perseus is helped by the gods in facing his\nherculean tasks, while Rassendyll is almost left on his own to fulfill his\nadventure.\n\n\nWhile both face difficult responsibilities and much is placed on\ntheir backs ( life of Andromeda in Perseus, King 's fate and Ruritania 's\nfuture in Rassendyll), they proved to be triumphant over these tasks, though\nPerseus only did it through the help of the gods, while Rassendyll, on his\nown strategies & bravery. \n\n \n\nb. Both the heroes are courting danger to achieve their end - -\nPerseus finds his way to Medusa to kill the creature of the sea ( Gorgon?) to\nsave Andromeda, and Rassendyll searches for the King and battles with Black\nMichael and Rupert to preserve Rudolf the King 's reign.\n\n\nTherefore their adventure is quite the same - savior-type plot,\nalthough it 's obvious that Perseus is battling larger than life enemies,\nwhile Rassendyll just faces human ( cunning, at that) enemies. \n\n \n\nc. Fate plays a large part in the two texts being compared.\n\n\nPerhaps it is fate that brings Rassendyll at Ruritania at the right\ntime and place and be with the right people to save a kingdom and be a better\nperson.\n\n\nSo is it for Perseus, who was saved from his grandfather 's wicked\nplan and emerge as savior of Andromeda.\n\n\nHowever, since there is too much divine intervention in Perseus '\nlife, he is not that free to chart his own destiny, since the gods can easily\nchange the course of his life and play with his fate.\n\n\nAll Perseus has to do is follow the destiny set for him by the gods.\n\n\nOn the other hand, Rassendyll exhibits more free will because he can\ndecide to take part in the \" pretension\", and choose to love or leave\nFlavia alone.\n\n\nYet through Flavia, it is shown that one is really not too free to\ndecide for himself because there is a duty to follow and a responsibility to\nfulfill. \n\n \n\n2. Using Gianetti 's category, \" Age of Innocence\n\" is a faithful adaptation of the text.\n\n\nThe scenes in the book like the ball, opera, and many others are\nshown in the film and little is taken out and combined like the scene where\nEllen asks what Newland will do while May is away. \n\n \n\nThe details in the book are the exact things shown in the movie\nlike the <delete> arrangement </delete> setting in the ball and the manners\nof the New Yorkers.\n\n\nIt doesn't go far from what is imagined while reading the book. \n\n \n\nIn fact, it could be also a literal adaptation since the lines\nof the voice-over as well as that of the characters are the exact dialogue in\nthe book, although some were deleted to condense the film.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d590f760-eb9a-40e8-a8bc-a29ca6087944", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.124610+00:00"}
{"text": "Maria Beatriz Isabel Acosta  1. Cite at least three events in the\nCold War that showed the weakness of Structural Realism as a Theory of\nInternational Relations. \n\n \n\nStructural Realism was explained by Kenneth Waltz.\n\n\nHe states that wars are natural occurrences whose control or\nelimination is beyond the wit of man: in other words, war is inevitable.\n\n\nIn the third image, International Conflict and International Anarchy,\nthere are several assumptions that were made.\n\n\nAnarchy is said to be present in states that there is no automatic\nharmony.\n\n\nThis means that conflict is inevitable and that in wars, there are no\nvictories but only varying degrees of defeat.\n\n\nEach state also pursues its own interests in ways it judges best.\n\n\nThis also defines the states as the central actors in International\nRelations ( they are unitary actors).\n\n\nThe State, according to Structural Realism, will use force to attain\nits goals if it values these goals more than it values the pleasures of\npeace.\n\n\nAnd because any State may at anytime use force, all states must\nconstantly be ready either to counter force with force ( \" fight\") or to pay\nthe cost of weakness ( \" surrender\").\n\n\nForce is a means of achieving the external ends of States because, as\nthe third image explains, there exists no coexistent, reliable process of\nreconciling the conflicts of interests that inevitably rise among similar\nunits in a condition of anarchy.\n\n\nThe power capabilities of the state come into play as a leverage in\nbargaining among states over the outcomes of conflicts.\n\n\nLeverage can be positive ( in forms of rewards), or negative ( in\nforms of punishments), but in both cases the purpose is to influence the\ndecisions and actions of another state so as to bring about a more favorable\noutcome for the actor using the leverage.\n\n\nIn other words, military force is an important form of leverage\nbecause of security dilemma.\n\n\nAnother concept tackled was about rationality-that states are\nrational actors, being able to decide on policies objectively. \n\n \n\nStructural Realism has been criticized and scrutinized by other\ntheorists and people, and they have concluded with four major lines of\ncriticism. \n\n \n\nThe first point to consider is the assumption of International\nAnarchy ( or the state of conflict).\n\n\nIf conflict is said to be inevitable, then how come there are\ninstances that States can cooperate?\n\n\nOrder also evolves through norms and institutions based on\nreciprocity ( give-and-take) and cooperation ( agreement), even on law.\n\n\nIn other words, convergence of interests is possible, that there can\nbe agreements and mutual decisions that will benefit both ( or all) states.\n\n\n \n\nIn the Cold War, there were instances where cooperation - not\nconflict - - existed.\n\n\nDuring  d\u00e9tente  ( or relaxation of\ntensions), there was mutual agreements and decisions made by the two\nsuperpowers - US and USSR.\n\n\nThey both collaborated in bringing about agreements on a ceasefire\nand disengagement of forces.\n\n\nThe following events or situations contradict the first assumption:\n\n\n 1. Summits: \" Spirit of Geneva &rdquo; and \" Spirit\nof Camp David &rdquo; \n\n \n\nIn the Geneva Summit, US and USSR had their first talk on\ndisarmament, German reunification, and wider contacts of east and west.\n\n\nThis is to assure both sides of less conflict and more harmony.\n\n\nIn the Spirit of Camp David, they had negotiated on Israel ( US\nassistance). \n\n\n 2. Trade between east and west \n\n \n\n \" Ospolitik &rdquo;  or eastern\n<unclear> one word </unclear> is contributed by West Germany Chancellor Willy\nBrandt.\n\n\nThis explains about the trade and economic relations of US/USSR.\n\n\nIn trade, one is to cooperate with the other so as to exchange goods.\n\n\nThe \" Great Grain Robbery &rdquo; is a concrete example of\nsuch.\n\n\nUS gave or sold grain at lowest prices to USSR to keep good relations\nwith them, even lower prices than that of their own country 's. \n\n \n\nThe second point to consider is the assumption that states are\nunitary actors: In contrary to this, State behavior is shaped by internal\nbargaining among and within bureaucracies, interest groups and other actors\nwith divergent goals and interest.\n\n\nIn short, non-state actors play important roles and that their\ninfluences should be considered in order to better understand the action of\nstates themselves. \n\n \n\nStructural Realism has some weaknesses, and can be proven from\nthe following events in the Cold War.\n\n\n 1. Non-state actors were pressure groups. \n\n \n\nDuring the duration of the Arms Race, the decision of armament\nwas influenced by many groups: the military, the weapons industry, laborers,\ntechnological development, and inventors ( scientists).\n\n\nEach of the groups had different and distinct reasons for wanting to\ndevelop and produce weaponry, and those pressures from them greatly affected\nthe decisions of the state. \n\n\n 2. Individuals influenced how state systems were run. \n\n \n\nWhen Joseph Stalin died, there was an observable shift in the\nUSSR policies.\n\n\nThis gives proof that individuals were important in shaping the state\npolicies.\n\n\nThe reason to this is because individuals, being unique and different\nfrom each other, have different perspectives and beliefs as to how a state\nmust be handled or governed.\n\n\nWhen Stalin died, he was replaced by Nikita Krushchev, who vetoed the\nways of Stalin - in fact, he ordered the \" de-Stalinization &rdquo; of\nthe Soviet Union.\n\n\nWhen Mikhail Gorbachev came into power, he also caused drastic\nchanges in Russia 's political system. \n\n\n 3. There can be other forms of leverage or ways to influence\nactors than using Military force. \n\n \n\nUsing military force can be costly compared with diplomacy,\nconflict resolution, peacekeeping and other nonmilitary means.\n\n\nIn the Cuban Missile Crisis during the Cold War, President Kennedy\nimposed or ordered naval blockade, instead of force or attacking USSR in\nCuba.\n\n\nAnother proposal which contradicts the assumption that one must use\nmilitary force as a leverage is the Moscow Treaty, signed by the 2\nsuperpowers in agreeing not to attack, ( use force) using military means, to\nresolve conflict.   2. DISCUSS THE MAIN ASSUMPTIONS OF THE FEMINIST\nAPPROACH TO INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. \n\n \n\nFeminism has two insights - gender is socially constructed, and\nthe world is pervasively shaped by gendered meanings. \n\n \n\nThe first insight explains that gender produces subjective\nidentities which we see and know the world.\n\n\nDisregarding gender would mean denying more than half of the\npopulation. \n\n \n\nThe second insight explains that we do not experience or \"\nknow &rdquo; the world as abstract \" humans &rdquo; but as embodied,\ngendered beings.\n\n\nIf gender is socially constructed, then IR  is socially constructed as well. \n\n \n\nThere are several areas taken up by Feminism, such as the concept\nof actor and structure.\n\n\nIn Realism, it is said that the relationship of states are anarchic (\nconflicting).\n\n\nFeminism stresses that the States correspond to the male person or\nmasculinity. \n\n \n\nFeminism explains also the transportization of values of the\nstate, that male values ( such as objectivity, rationality, courage,\nindependence) dominate the state since states are dominated by males.\n\n\nFeminism tells us that states need not be independent and sovereign.\n\n\n \n\nThe three strands/kinds of feminist approach has different\nassumptions as well.\n\n\nThe Essentialists point out the role or condition of \" women as\nwomen\", and accept women 's place in society.\n\n\nThe liberalists state that women should and are equal to men, that\nthey must have equality in responsibility and roles, such as in the\ngovernment and in the military.\n\n\nThe postmodernists on the other hand differ a lot from the other two.\n\n\nThey challenge a total rethinking of the structure, challenging\nsociety.\n\n\nThis is the most difficult approach to achieve, because this means\nyou have to change the entire structure.   3. COMPARE & CONTRAST TWO\nUS ARMS RACE DOCTRINES. \n\n \n\nThe arms race policies were agreed upon according to the increase\nand/or decrease of defense budget, and according to the emphasis on the\nkind/type of weapons. \n\n \n\nTwo out of several arms race policies of the US are the \"\nFlexible Response \" and the \" StarWars Project \" (\nStrategic Defense Initiative).\n\n\nThese two doctrines favored nuclear weapons rather than conventional\nones.\n\n\nIn \" Flexible Response \" , there is the theory of\n\" MAD \" that was developed.\n\n\n\" Mutually Assured Destruction \" meant that if\nRussia attacked the west, the west would make sure that they would suitably\nretaliate ( there would be no winners).\n\n\nThere are two conditions: there must be no first strike capability (\nor the ability to wipe out in one strike), and having second strike\ncapability ( ability to survive the first strike).\n\n\nIt is also a policy to use the same weapons which the other party is\nusing against the US. \n\n \n\nThe \" Starwars \" or SDI system was originally\nplanned to provide a layered defense employing advanced weapons technologies,\nsome of which were only in the preliminary stage.\n\n\nThe goal of SDI was to intercept incoming missiles in midcourse (\nhigh above the earth).\n\n\nSome of the weapons were in development, but others were not certain\nto be attainable.\n\n\nThis policy was controversial because of the cost - it was estimated\nto total more than &dollar;100 billion.\n\n\nOther nations also feared that the SDI system could have been used\noffensively.   4. COMPARE AND CONTRAST THE NATURE AND WAYS OF\nADDRESSING STATE-CENTERED AND HUMAN-SECURITY ISSUES. \n\n \n\nAfter the Cold War, there was a noticeable shift in security\nissues from State to Human Security.\n\n\nState Security stresses the military defense of the state and\nexertion of influence over other states, whereas human security is the\nsecurity of the individual as a minimum security against gross human rights\nviolations.\n\n\nBoth have core values ( for humans, it is their rights, basic needs,\nfreedom,  etc.  , and for the state, their territory,\nsovereignty and population), and when these values are threatened ( by other\nstates and intra-state groups for states, and other people and government,\npoverty for individuals) this poses as a threat to the referent object ( the\nstate and the individual).\n\n\nIn both issues, other factors threaten the referent object, most\ncommonly through ( physical) violence such as war, revolts, ethnic violence\nand government abuse.\n\n\nAnd in addition, when either one of the referent objects is\nthreatened, this also leads for the other one to be threatened as well, for\nthe state composes of individuals too.\n\n\nIn solving these issues, one common denominator is acquiring the\nproper knowledge as to why these issues occur in the first place.\n\n\nAs the role of Global Society plays, it must intervene in a\nhumanitarian way.\n\n\nWith multilateral intervention, there must be a cooperative effort in\nthe part of many states to address these problems.\n\n\nEducation will also lead to a better understanding and will avoid\nprejudice.\n\n\nIn contrast, threats to the state can be resolved through military\nmeans, such as going to war.  \n\n\n\n\nBy: Irene Marie R. Ignacio\n\n\n Midterm Exam: Major Essay \n\n \n\nThe Cold War truly brought out new major changes and effects in\neach and everyone 's life.\n\n\nThe Cold War, which occurred from 1950 to 1990, was the conflict\nbetween the two great superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, in\nideological, political, economical and social terms.\n\n\nThis Cold War is very inevitable to mention when talking about\ninternational security, for in this event, the use and real production of\nnuclear weapons and it has the highest effect on the national budgets of\nnations.\n\n\nEven if there really were no big and controversial confrontations\nbetween the US and USSR, it was still called a \" \" war &rdquo;\n\" , because it still affected different countries and actually used\nother countries to war.\n\n\nIt also increased the supply of arms, therefore leading to an\nincrease in arms race.\n\n\nThis essay aims to give three events in this Cold War that showed the\nweakness of Realism as an International Relations Theory. \n\n \n\nThe International Relations Theory functions to describe what is\ngoing on, to explain the current situation and to predict what may happen\nnext.\n\n\nIt concentrates on the relationship of states regarding war and\npeace.\n\n\nRealism, using this theory, has three main assumptions.\n\n\nFirst, states are the most influential and main actors.\n\n\nSecond, states ' actions are motivated by their own interests.\n\n\nLastly, conflict is inevitable.\n\n\nIn relation to the Cold War, these assumptions are truly falsified\nand not completely true.\n\n\nThey have been proven not totally applicable using certain events in\nthe Cold War. \n\n \n\nFirst, the realist thought that States are the most influential\nand main actors during the Cold War is challenged and weakened by the\nexistence of the United Nations.\n\n\nThe United Nations did so many important actions during that time.\n\n\nBut one specific event is  having the Baruch\nPlan.\n\n\nThis plan may also be used to represent the Arms Race.\n\n\nHowever, since this plan was still included and important in the\nCold War, this paper wishes to use the Baruch Plan to show how existence and\nparticipation of the UN weakened the first mentioned realist assumption.\n\n\nThe Baruch Plan  ensured that the new source\nof energy was controlled by the UN and used for peaceful means.\n\n\nIn addition, not only was the UN formed alone, there was also the\nexistence and participation of other non-state actors.\n\n\nThese global organizations were motivated to move by inner factors.\n\n\nWith all these, we cannot conclude that states were indeed the most\ninfluential and main actors during the war.\n\n\nThese non-state actors, such as the UN, served big significant roles\nduring the Cold War.\n\n\nTheir influences were really great and needed to understand the\nactions of the states themselves.\n\n\nTherefore, leaving out  non-state actors is one\nmain weakness of Realism as an IR Theory. \n\n \n\nSecond, the realist thought that states ' actions are motivated\nby their own interests was disproven by the signing of the different treaties\nby different countries during the Cold War.\n\n\nAn example of this event is the Test Ban Treaty in 1963, where it\nstates that nuclear testing is prohibited in the atmosphere, outer space and\nunderwater.\n\n\nThen, there was the Moscow Treaty wherein Germany and USSR agreed\nthat they will not use violence on each other 's territories.\n\n\nIn addition, there was the Strategic Arms Limitation Theory I and II\nwhich limited the deployments of US and USSR.\n\n\nThese are just some of the events in the Cold War that can prove\nthat it is not totally true that states act according to their own interests.\n\n\nWhen we say \" treaty \" , it is an agreement of at\nleast two parties.\n\n\nBy signing it, you are agreeing on the benefit of all and not just\nyour own interest.\n\n\nTherefore, it is not necessarily true that states act according to\ntheir own interest, because they also act for the benefit of everyone\ninvolved.  Lastly, Realism also assumes and states that conflict is\ninevitable.\n\n\nConflict is not inevitable, for they can be avoided and resolved.\n\n\nThe D\u00e9tente of the 1950s and 1960s to 1980s show and prove this.\n\n\nUSSR joined the summer games in 1952 and winter games in 1956.\n\n\nThis clearly shows trust for the part of USSR.\n\n\nThen, the Anti-Proliferation Treaty came about wherein it was\nsettled that weapons should not be supplied, produced and accepted.\n\n\nIn addition, there was the Four Power Agreement that stated that\nquestions causing conflicts were regulated.\n\n\nIn a way, we can sense that states made efforts to avoid conflict.\n\n\nTrust was showed, like USSR 's joining the games.\n\n\nThese events can show the willingness and capability of states to\navoid war.\n\n\nIndeed, conflict is evitable.\n\n\n Truly, Realism as an IR Theory has its own\nweaknesses when we look at its assumptions.\n\n\nStates are not just the main actors, for there was the active\nparticipation of non-state actors like the United Nations.\n\n\nNext, states ' actions are not just motivated by their own\ninterests, for some events show that they act for the benefit of all.\n\n\nLastly, conflict is avoidable, for states can make efforts and\nwillingness to avoid conflict.\n\n\nAll in all, theories, like IR and Realism, have its own weaknesses\nand flaws.\n\n\nWe just have to open our eyes and be open to these.\n\n\nShort Answer Questions: 1. For years, women have tried to uplift\ntheir roles as women. 2.\n\n\nWith this, an action, called Feminism came about. 3.\n\n\nFeminism is the power struggle challenging patriarchy. 4.\n\n\nIt is an awareness that women are oppressed and exploited in\nsociety. 5.\n\n\nFeminists see the need for the uplifting roles of women. 6.\n\n\nThe feminist approach, as an International Relations view, assumes\nthat in a realist 's point of view, states are the main actors and explained\nthrough laws. 7.\n\n\nFeminists do not believe in the possibility of the state acting\nagainst dominant male interests. 8.\n\n\nThey think that if the state penetrates to its foundation of gender\nbias, it cannot act in a neutral, disinterested and \" self-maximizing\n&rdquo; manner to provide security. 9.\n\n\nIn addition, feminists assume that the state projects to reclaim the\nprivate. 10.\n\n\nThey say that the human rights are not examined well. 11.\n\n\nFeminists reject classical paradigm of the concept of power. 12.\n\n\nThey challenge the socially constructed look on power and expose the\ndichotomies, like public and private. 13.\n\n\n14. During the Arms Race, there were two very distinct doctrines\nthat came about. 15.\n\n\nThese are the NSC 68 and the New look by the U. 16.\n\n\nS. 17.\n\n\nThe NSC 68 was by Paul Nitze. 18.\n\n\nIn here, it assumed that U. 19.\n\n\nS. 20.\n\n\nS. 21.\n\n\nR. 22.\n\n\nwould have 200 long-ranged atomic charges with its build up. 23.\n\n\nThe US was threatened, and therefore, had to rearm. 24.\n\n\nThe U. 25.\n\n\nS. 26.\n\n\nincreased its national defense budget to\n\n$40B. 27.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the other doctrine is the New Look. 28.\n\n\nThe New Look is a new defense policy stating that they would respond\nto even small conventional attacks using nuclear weapons. 29.\n\n\nThey will attack in a different area, in a different way. 30.\n\n\nThese two doctrines were motivated by the Korean War in the 1950 's.\n31.\n\n\nNSC 68 refers to the deployment of missiles by U. 32.\n\n\nS. 33.\n\n\nS. 34.\n\n\nR. 35.\n\n\n, while the New look is about the deployment of tactical weapons by\nthe U. 36.\n\n\nS. 37.\n\n\nBoth, on the other hand, are related in the sense that they are both\nabout the increase in the national defense budget of the U. 38.\n\n\nS. 39.\n\n\nMoreover, they are both concerned with improving the weapons. 40.\n\n\n41. After the Cold War, there was a radical change on the onlook of\nsecurity. 42.\n\n\nThe focus on state security was shifted to human security. 43.\n\n\nWhen we say state-centered security, we are focusing n the situation\nof the state as a whole. 44.\n\n\nWe look at it in political and economical terms. 45.\n\n\nWe try to see if the state, as a unit, is uplifting. 46.\n\n\nOn the other hand, when we say human security, we are concerned with\nthe individuals themselves within a state. 47.\n\n\nWhen we talk about security, we are referring to a relative concept\nbased on a subject of referent. 48.\n\n\nIn state security, we look at the international states and global\nsocieties as helping factors. 49.\n\n\nHowever, in human security, we look at human rights as protecting\nfactors. 50.\n\n\nIn a state, the state itself is the object of referent. 51.\n\n\nIts core values are its territories, government, population, etc.\n52.\n\n\nThen, its exogenous or threats are other states, intra-state war,\nviolence, etc. 53.\n\n\nIn contrast, for human security, we see the individuals as the\nobject of referent. 54.\n\n\nTheir core values are their rights, basic needs, like food, and\nshelter, freedom and economic and social statuses. 55.\n\n\nTheir exogenous are other people, government, poverty, ethnic\nviolence and government abuse. 56.\n\n\nIf we are to compare them, they are the same in the sense that the\nstate and individuals seek for security. 57.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "89a05dbc-7d89-49de-8245-45b9d488c076", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.126082+00:00"}
{"text": "LANGUAGE TEACHING   \n\n \n\n1. Obligatory Question: Explain/interpret the following statement\nand give concrete examples from an academic setting:  \" The\nclassroom...is not simply a neutral channel for the passage of information\nfrom teacher to learner.\n\n\nIt is a dynamic, interactive environment which affects the nature\nboth of what is taught and what is learnt.\n\n\nThe classroom thus generates its own syllabus. &rdquo;  \n\n\n \n\nAt a time when learners are considered  TABULA RASA\n , the teacher 's role is that of a  MAESTRA/MAESTRO\n - the sole source of knowledge that learners are expected to\nabsorb.\n\n\nThere was little room for interaction and questions were addressed\nbecause they are means of knowing, understanding, and clarifying, not because\nthey are signs that the learners are thinking and generating ideas.\n\n\nCommunication, being restricted to this type, was between teacher and\nstudent, hardly between and among peers.\n\n\nAs views on the nature of language and language teaching evolved, so\ndid the roles played by teachers and learners.\n\n\nThe classroom became learning and learner-centered and teaching became\nmore flexible, that is, adjustments and modifications are made to suit\nlearners ' needs and learning style.\n\n\nThe syllabus stands as a representation of the end goals set within\nthe curriculum, the attainment of which varies according to the dynamics\ndisplayed by the learners.\n\n\nIn a class, for instance, that best performs when competition is\ninvolved, games may be utilized more than socialized recitation as a tool for\nlearning. \n\n \n\nTeachers also learn to take a cue from students.\n\n\nIn my research writing class, this is best illustrated by an activity\nI adopted as an aid to teaching students how to paraphrase.\n\n\nHaving cited the importance of presenting the ideas of other writers\nin one 's own words, we proceeded to the quite predictable task of\nparaphrasing 2-3 passages, which the students hardly appreciated, judging by\nthe grunts and groans I hear in the duration of the activity - which stands\nin stark contrast to the enthusiasm they show when there are group tasks.\n\n\nConsequently, the result showed a prevalence of literal paraphrasing,\nhardly reflective of any appreciation for paraphrasing as a useful\nreader-writer tool.\n\n\nObviously, we had to go through another round - and perhaps more,\nuntil the result becomes satisfactory, that is, until they realize that\nparaphrasing is not synonymous to substituting words and phrases. \n\n \n\nSo the meeting after that, in order to elicit the same level of\nexcitement they show in activities that involve friendly competition, I\ndevised a game that will earn them points for every correct answer and added\nincentive to the first five that finishes ahead.\n\n\nIn groups of 3, they were tasked to find the popular quote or rhyme\nthat corresponds to each of 10 sentences that make use of uncommon terms,\nusually high-faluting words.\n\n\nOne example is  \" scintillate, scintillate, miniscule\nasteroid &rdquo;  which translates into  \" Twinkle,\ntwinkle, little star. &rdquo; \n\n\nAnother is  \" Vapors & fumes appear where conflagration\nexists &rdquo;  which is simply said as  \" Where there 's\nsmoke, there 's fire. &rdquo; \n\n\nAlthough the items proved to be difficult, the students claimed they\nenjoyed it and it made them understand that as research writers, they make\nuse of the skill of paraphrasing to aid comprehension & to say things in\nsimple words, not to impress their teacher with their use of \" BIG\n&rdquo; words that are almost always misused. \n\n \n\nBy adjusting to learners ' needs, interest, & style, the\nclassroom, as illustrated in the preceding account, becomes a place for\nAUTHENTIC learning that follows a two-way traffic.  \n\n \n\n2. Language experts argue that reading and writing are \n\" two sides of the same coin. &rdquo; \n\n\na. Explain what the argument means.\n\n\nb. Discuss the pedagogical implications of the argument.  \n\n \n\nOf the four MACRO SKILLS, reading & writing are associated with\nreceptive & productive skills, respectively.\n\n\nThe reading-writing connection has seen a lot of changes, however,\nand the view that both reading & writing are interactive processes is now\nwidely considered.\n\n\nThis paradigm, as represented by the model below  stresses that reading goes beyond bottom-up &\ntop-down processing and writing ceases to be product-oriented.\n\n\nConnecting the two macro skills is THINKING which signifies that\ninteraction is present when one reads a text because he/she engages in a more\ncomplex socio-cognitive process which is manifested in the strategies he/she\nemploys in comprehending the text, the prediction he/she makes, the judgment\nhe/she passes, the questions he/she raises, the schema he/she activates,\n etc. \n\n\nLikewise, THINKING is evident in writing, this, too, being a complex\nsocio-cognitive process whose goal is to communicate the writers ' thought to\nthe readers, who in turn, interacts with the writers by responding to the\ntext in such ways as those enumerated above.\n\n\nThe terms \" INTERACTIVE \" & \" RECURSIVE\n\" have taken center stage, relegating to the background terms like\n\" MECHANICAL \" & \" ISOLATED \" .\n\n\nThe language teacher adjusts as well, giving more importance to\nPROCESS than PRODUCT, allowing room for changes & revisions, treating errors\nas opportunities for learning rather than reflections of inadequacy.\n\n\nHence, although reading & writing are two distinct skills, they share\nthe view that THINKING is an ongoing process that is activated by the onset\nof reading and/or writing BUT NOT TERMINATED at the same time the reading or\nwriting stops.\n\n\nIn that sense, they are  \" two sides of the same coin\n&rdquo;  & should be regarded as such in the language classroom. \n\n\n \n\n3. The last three decades have seen the development of writing\ninstruction as a separate discipline.\n\n\nTheories of writing instruction have emerged and influenced\nclassroom teaching.\n\n\na. Discuss the current status of writing instruction in the\nPhilippines within the context of the theories that have developed in the\nlast few decades.\n\n\nb. State which of these theories have primarily influenced your\nteaching of writing, and why.  \n\n \n\nThe flurry of methods, approaches, & techniques in the teaching\nof writing can be streamlined into 3 basic/distinct paradigms : 1) PRODUCT\nORIENTATION; 2) PROCESS APPROACH; and 3) PRAGMATIC VIEW. \n\n \n\nThe first is influenced by prescriptivists & structuralists who\nview language as a set of rules & patterns that should be internalized to\nachieve accuracy.\n\n\nThis is best represented by the era of composition writing, which my\ngrade school & high school teachers subjected me to.\n\n\nStudents who are under the tutelage of a product-oriented approach to\nwriting are made to write essays that adhere to the set objectives which\noften dictate the type of rhetorical discourse & the specific language forms\nto be used.\n\n\nThe grade for each composition is usually based on criteria that\ninclude GRAMMAR & MECHANICS. \n\n \n\nThe second contests this emphasis on correctness & instead treats\nwriting as a PROCESS; hence the term...\n\n\nRhetorical moves are not prescribed and elements of grammar are least\nconsidered.\n\n\nIf writing were to be recognized as a product, it is a PRODUCT OF\nREVISION because writing is not considered final until the idea ( a product\nof brainstorming or any prewriting strategy) is satisfactorily communicated\nto the intended audience ( via peer editing and constant revising). \n\n \n\nThe third shifts the focus from PROCESS to CONTEXT.\n\n\nThe pragmatic view underscores the interplay between the WRITER and\nthe SITUATION/DISCIPLINE/CONTENT/CULTURE.\n\n\nThis is where such approaches as WAC ( Writing across the\nCurriculum), ESP ( English for Specific Purposes), & CBI ( Content-Based\nInstruction) belong, the bottom line being that each field or discipline has\nits own convention & register, so writing style must adjust accordingly.\n\n\nWriting is subjected to correctness or accuracy as the field sees\nfit.\n\n\nIn that sense, the pragmatic view becomes a combination of PRODUCT &\nPROCESS. \n\n \n\nOf these, it is the third that suits me best as a teacher of\nresearch writing.\n\n\nThe course aims to help students write research reports on topics\ngenerated in their specific field of discipline.\n\n\nWith this objective in mind, I combine PRODUCT with PROCESS by\nprescribing the format ( Introduction-Method-Results-Discussion) and letting\nthe students go through revision of both content & structure.  \n\n \n\n3. Empirical research in reading instruction has advanced\nstrongly the importance of schema theory in reading instruction.\n\n\na. Explain fully what schema theory is and what its implications are\nfor teaching.\n\n\nb. Explain and illustrate how culturally based and culturally biased\nschema can cause comprehension problems among students.  \n\n \n\n\" Schema \" refers to an individual 's set of\nbeliefs shaped by his/her culture, background, personal experiences.\n\n\nThe Schema theory advocates the importance of this in comprehending a\ntext.\n\n\nTo the teacher, this means that since readers interact with the text,\nthe reading selections should not be culture-based & biased as this would\nimpede comprehension & sometimes mislead learners. \n\n \n\nA Chinese short story, \" \" A Country Boy Quits\nSchool, &rdquo; \" written as a strong reaction against western\ncolonization, matches the sentiments of readers who feel marginalized by\nculture-based texts.\n\n\nThe author employs humor in the story, as evidenced by the following\naccounts:\n\n \n\nAfter a week in school, the boy learns a fable that features a\nhorse & an ox in a tea party.\n\n\nHaving heard of this, the grandmother is terrified because it was the\nfirst time she heard of oxen & horses talking & drinking tea the way humans\ndo.\n\n\nShe thought these must have been frightful creatures that were\npossessed by evil spirits ( which were common in Chinese myths).\n\n\nBut she kept this to herself. \n\n \n\nOn another occasion, she heard the boy reciting  \"\nThis is mama,\"   \" this is papa &rdquo;  with\nhis gaze fixed on the pages of the book ( on his part, for fear that the\npictures would walk away).\n\n\nShe couldn't understand why the boy speaks of \" mama\n\" & \" papa \" but does not mention \" grandma\n\" & \" grandpa \" .\n\n\nShe became so furious, she wanted to leave the house on the account\nthat her grandson no longer loves his grandparents.\n\n\nWhen the mother heard of this, she consulted the boy 's book &\nwondered why  \" This is mama &rdquo;  showed somebody\nelse 's picture, not hers!\n\n\nUpon confrontation with the father, a series of other humorous scenes\nensue - all illustrating how TEXTS that speak of experiences beyond a person 's\nschema can result in confusion because of differing cultures.  \n\n\n\n\n  LANGUAGE THEORY   \n\n \n\n1. There is general agreement among scholars in the field that\none major property of discourse is  MEANING  .\n\n\nDiscuss the notion of meaning from  two  of the\nfollowing perspectives:\n\n\na. Speech Act Theory\n\n\nb. Gricean Pragmatics\n\n\nc. Conversational Analysis\n\n\nd. Ethnography of Communication  \n\n\n GRICEAN PRAGMATICS \n\n \n\nMeaning is inferred from utterances and is made clear between\ninterlocutors who abide by the COOPERATIVE PRINCIPLES that adhere to the FOUR\nMAXIMS: Quantity, Quality, Relevance & Manner.\n\n\nIf the speaker communicates his/her intention in a way that is clear\n& truthful & does not go beyond what is asked of him/her nor does he/she omit\ninformation or add what he/she does not have proof of, then MEANING is\nsuccessfully communicated & the interlocutors understand each other because\nthere exists cooperation between speaker & hearer. \n\n\n CONVERSATIONAL ANALYSIS \n\n \n\nThere exists a NEGOTIATION OF MEANING between the interlocutors &\nthis negotiation lasts in the same duration as that of the transaction.\n\n\nHence, meaning is created at the same time it is communicated; it is\ninterpreted and / or understood while it is being created.\n\n\nThis displays the complex ability of interlocutors who, when engaged\nin conversation, are preoccupied with the burden of creating & transacting\nmeaning SIMULTANEOUSLY.\n\n\nLikewise, this reflects the impressive capacity of humans to include\nparalinguistic signals in the process of negotiating meaning;  i.e.\n accounting for the change in intonation or expression or other\nnon-verbals, in order to interpret what one wished to communicate.\n\n\nExpressions used for REPAIR lend concrete evidence to this\nNEGOTIATION OF MEANING;  e.g.  \" \" What did\nyou say?\", \" \" \" Do you mean...\", \" \"\n\" You 're probably referring to... &rdquo; \"  \n\n \n\n2. Recent theories of second language acquisition have given\nemphasis to communicative competence.\n\n\nDiscuss this notion as a shift from the early paradigm of linguistic\ncompetence and in terms of its relevance to you as an English teacher. \n\n\n \n\nCommunicative competence entails linguistic competence; \ni.e.  one cannot claim to have communicative competence if he/she\ndoes not have knowledge of the grammar of the language he/she speaks, or what\nis termed as \" LINGUISTIC COMPETENCE \" .\n\n\nOne who has knowledge of the inventory of sounds in a language, the\nallowed ways by which these sounds can be combined, the knowledge of how\nthese combinations can constitute a word, a phrase & a sentence clearly has\nlinguistic competence - a manifestation of the internal or mental grammar\nthat is biologically endowed exclusively to humans.\n\n\nIts correct application as gauged in utterance is termed as \"\nLINGUISTIC PERFORMANCE \" .\n\n\nWhen this performance accounts for APPROPRIATENESS;  i.e.\n what is said is in the right context - to the intended recipient,\nat the right time, in the intended or socially acceptable manner, then one is\nsaid to have COMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE.\n\n\nClearly, the shift is made from WHAT IS RIGHT ( a concern of\nprescriptivists) to WHAT IS APPROPRIATE ( a concern of sociolinguists, in\ngeneral). \n\n \n\nA \" Tarzan \" comic strip by Gary Larson\nillustrates how encompassing & ( much more) important communicative\ncompetence is: \n\n \n\nIn the first 3 frames, Tarzan rehearses what he will say to Jane\non the occasion of their first meeting ( in which he displays linguistic\ncompetence).\n\n\nIn separate thought bubbles are ( with some alterations as I couldn't\nremember the sequence of the words exactly):\n\n\nFrame 1 :  Hi.\n\n\nAllow me to introduce myself, I am Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle.\n\n\n\nFrame 2 :  My name is Tarzan, & I believe you are known as\nJane. \n\n\nFrame 3:  It 's a pleasure to meet you.\n\n\nI am Tarzan.\n\n\nAnd you?\n\n\nIn the last Frame, however, upon meeting Jane face-to-face, he\nfumbles ( which could be interpreted as lack of communicative competence):\n\n\n Me Tarzan! You Jane! \n\n\nafter which he covers his face in shame.  \n\n \n\nAs an English teacher, this paradigm shift demonstrates the\nshift in focus of the English classroom.\n\n\nEmphasis now should be given to the learner 's ability to produce\nrelevant/appropriate utterances, with feedback on grammatical construction\ntaking the sidelines & will be explicitly stated only on occasions where\nmeaning is obstructed by lack of linguistic competence.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "47737270-ab7a-4ec0-8c71-bf89f5bd0d5a", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.128055+00:00"}
{"text": "Student ID No: 10090665\n\n\nDate: March 9, 2002\n\n\nSubject: Psycholinguistics\n\n\nTeacher: Dr. Allan B. I. Bernardo \n\n \n\nProblem: Based on your reading on language acquisition, describe\nyour own theory of word learning.\n\n\nYour theory should specify ( a) the general processes by which\nchildren come to acquire understanding of the meaning of words, and ( b) the\nfactors that affect these general processes.\n\n\nYou should feel free to appropriate the general assumptions and\nprinciples of different theories of word learning; just make sure you make\nthe corresponding citations.\n\n\nFinally, you should cite the pertinent empirical evidence to support\nyour theory.  \n\n \n\nAs a mother and a teacher, I have my own observations of how\nlanguage is learned or acquired but I recognize the fact that to answer this\nquestion scholarly I cannot invoke my own idea.\n\n\nTherefore I will refer to the works of the different scholars in the\nfield of psycholinguistics and linguistics who have posited theories in\nrelation to the acquisition of language, in particular how children acquire a\nlanguage. \n\n \n\nThe traditional theory was that cited by B. F. Skinner and other\nbehaviorists which posits that language is learned by imitation or by habit.\n\n\nThis view came under heavy fire and is no longer accepted nowadays.\n\n\nOne of the reasons offered against this traditional view is that it\ncannot fully account for the errors children manifest in their early language\nlearning.\n\n\nFor example, a three-year old will say:  \" Dad throwed\nthe ball &rdquo;  or  \" He goed to the market &rdquo;\n .\n\n\nIf children indeed learn from adults via imitation, what could\naccount for these errors since these ungrammatical sentences are not produced\nor heard in the adults?\n\n\nOf course I am talking about normal correct adult speech.\n\n\nSo this theory is rejected, especially in the Chomskyan world.\n\n\nIf Chomsky ( 1964), criticized this view, then what reason does he\nhave to offer, and what alternative theory does he have to explain how\nchildren acquire language?\n\n\nHis answer is that children possess an innate capacity to learn a\nlanguage ( what he calls UG) and he adds that all children undergo the same\nprocess.\n\n\nEvidence to this may be seen in the stages of language development\nwhich begin from vegetative sounds, cooing, vocal play, babbling, one-word\nstage, two-word stage, telegraphic speech, sorting stage, and finally\ncomplete, normal speech ( the period covers from birth till five years old;\nsource: Dictionary of Linguistic Terms under the field of Psycholinguistics,\n2001, General Reference Section.\n\n\nThis is also discussed in Paul Bloom 's article, 1994).\n\n\nThis means that children have the cognitive capacity to learn a\nlanguage and therefore, even without training, they will pick up a language\ngiven the right environment for language learning. \n\n \n\nThe next question now that begs to be answered following the\nChomsky 's line of argument is how can he account for the errors that\nchildren commit in their early stage of language learning?\n\n\nChomsky 's answer to this is that the errors are part of the\nperformance errors.\n\n\nHe distinguishes two concepts relative to language acquisition, and\nperformance is one of these.\n\n\nPerformance pertains to how language is used by someone in response\nto what another interlocutor has said.\n\n\nSome examples of performance errors are slips, hesitation, and\nstuttering.\n\n\nCompetence, on the other hand, is defined by Chomsky as the learner 's\ntacit knowledge of grammar rules ( definitions of \" competence\n\" and \" performance \" are also discussed in the\npreliminary pages of Andrew Radford 's book  Syntactic Theory  ,\n1997). \n\n \n\nOthers say that children learn by observing the social contexts\nthat govern communication or when communication occurs.\n\n\nUpon examining the contexts, children learn meanings of words and are\neventually able to use these words in the appropriate contexts. \n\n \n\nBut what have I learned in my readings in Psycholinguistics that\nemphasized child language acquisition ( since psycholinguistics is a broad\nfield and cannot afford to discuss all matters pertaining to the mind in\nrelation to language)?\n\n\nThe course gave me so much to think about with regard to theories in\nword learning and some of these are the constraints and syntactic cues to\nword learning.\n\n\nI begin my discussion on these below. \n\n \n\nAs early as the first article of Paul Bloom ( 1994) entitled\n\" \" OVERVIEW: CONTROVERSIES IN LANGUAGE ACQUISITION, &rdquo;\n\" we can already see what these constraints and syntactic cues are.\n\n\nThe first is the whole-object constraint proposed by Ellen Markman (\n1990).\n\n\nOther proponents are Markman and Hutchinson ( 1984), Markman and\nWachtel ( 1988).\n\n\n( There are others but I am afraid to mention their corresponding\nyears lest I make a mistake.)\n\n\nThe principal advocate of this constraint is Markman, who posits that\nchildren assume that words or labels refer to whole objects rather than to\nother parts or properties ( shape, color, size) or substances.\n\n\nThe other constraint is the taxonomic constraint, which posits that\nchildren choose objects of the same kinds as referents to novel labels rather\nchoosing thematically related objects (  e.g.  dog and a\nbone).\n\n\nMarkman conducted experiments using infants from 18 months to 2 years\ntesting these two constraints and results proved her hypotheses.\n\n\nHowever, there 's a qualification as to when children as early as 18\nmonths use the taxonomic constraint.\n\n\nAccording to Markman, children use the taxonomic constraint when a\nlabel or a novel word is provided, but when this is absent, children opt for\nobjects that are taxonomically related to the target object presented.\n\n\nFor example, if I present a picture of dog and labeled it as\n\"  dax  \" , and then in the second condition I\nagain presented a picture of a dog and its bone, and then I say to an\n18-month-old child,  \" Find me another one. &rdquo; \n\n\nIf the taxonomic constraint works as Markman and others claim, then\nthe child will choose the dog as the referent of the novel label \"\n dax  \" rather than the bone.\n\n\nHowever, if the target object is not given a label, following the\nsame example, just \" dog \" in the first condition and then\nin the next condition two pictures are presented, that of a dog and a bone,\nthen the child will choose \" bone \" when cued to find\nanother one.\n\n\nThe third constraint to word learning which Markman proposes is the\nmutual exclusivity constraint which means that children assume that there is\nonly one label to an object.\n\n\nThe theory may be stated otherwise: Children assume that there is\nonly one lexical entry occupying a semantic niche.\n\n\nThis constraint is helpful because it overrides the bias that\nchildren have to objects.\n\n\nAn example of how mutual exclusivity constraint works is this.\n\n\nA child is familiar to the concept and word \" cup \" .\n\n\nWhen an experimenter holds a cup and an unfamiliar object, say a\nmagic clipper which he calls \"  krucker  \" ( that\nis transparent and contains two binders inside), the child will assume that\n\"  krucker  \" cannot refer to cup and therefore\nchooses the magic clipper as the referent of the word \"  krucker\n \" .\n\n\nNow I said that the mutual exclusivity constraint is helpful in\noverriding the bias that children have towards objects.\n\n\nHow does this work?\n\n\nWell it works this way.\n\n\nWhen a child is given a novel label \" chrome \" and\nan object say a cup again to which he/she is familiar and presented another\nobject that is exactly the same except for the material that it is made of\nand is instructed to point to the \" chrome \" , the child\nwill assume that \" chrome \" refers to something else, either\nto the substance or to another property of the cup. \n\n \n\nThere are criticisms offered to the constraints proposed by\nMarkman.\n\n\nOne criticism stems from Nelson ( 1988) who argues that they are\nfundamentally flawed.\n\n\nGathercole also criticizes the constraints to word learning saying\nthat they are not really constraints in the real sense but rather a bias.\n\n\nHe calls attention to the experiment conducted by Markman that lends\nsupport to how children use the mutual exclusivity constraint.\n\n\nHe says that this cannot represent the general children since the\nresults only showed a statistical trend in using the bias.\n\n\nPaul Bloom and Deborah Keleman ( 1995) in their paper on syntactic\ncues to learning nouns also advance their criticisms against the whole-object\nconstraint saying that the child is not confronted with just whole objects\nall the time. \n\n \n\nPaul Bloom, however, noted that the criticisms hurled against the\nconstraints to word learning do not speak of a critical flaw but simply a\ngap, and therefore further studies need to be conducted to find their\ngeneralizability of application. \n\n \n\nAfter Ellen Markman comes Eve Clark who also proposes a\nconstraint similar to mutual exclusivity which she calls the \"\nprinciple of contrast \" .\n\n\nThe mutual exclusivity by the way goes with other names like the\n\" one-to-one mapping \" of Slobin, if my memory serves me\nright, the \" Uniqueness principle \" of Pinker ( 1987) and\nthe \" principle of preemption \" .\n\n\nOf all these other names, the principle of contrast is the one that\ncomes closest to the mutual exclusivity constraint.\n\n\nAccording to Clark, there is no such thing as synonymous words for\nevery word is different in meaning.\n\n\nIf there is such a difference then it is very slight or subtle so\nthat if children know that a word is different in meaning, when presented\nwith a novel term like \"  bicker  \" as referring to\nthe novel object ( toothpaste squeezer) to which they are not yet familiar,\nconcomitant with a term that they are already familiar, say a feeding bottle,\nthen they will assume that \"  bicker  \" pertains to\nthe toothpaste squeezer, and not to the feeding bottle. \n\n \n\nClark also talks about the principle of conventionality and other\nprinciples like transparency, simplicity, and production.\n\n\nThe principle of conventionality states that words in a language have\nestablished meanings as agreed upon by the members of the community where\nthat language is used so that if words already have established meanings,\nthen when novel terms are used, they cannot be the same as those words\nalready existent in the lexicon of the said language.\n\n\nTherefore, children, or even adults, since this specific principle\nalso works for adults, are constrained to look for something else as the\nmeaning of the novel terms.\n\n\nWhat about the principle of transparency and simplicity?\n\n\nWell I take the two together since they are similar.\n\n\nThese two principles assume that if language is given or used in a\ntransparent and simple manner to the children, they will inevitably be aided\nto learn the language.\n\n\nProduction, on the other hand, maintains that if children are to\nlearn, they must hear this language in a suitable learning environment so\nthat they themselves can in process acquire the language. \n\n \n\nAside from the constraints to word learning, there are also\nsyntactic cues that are thought to be in operation in the children.\n\n\nProponents of syntactic cues to word learning are Landau and\nGleitman, Lila, Hirsh-Pasek; Golinkoff ( 1988); Brown ( 1957); Naigles,\nLeticia R. ( 1990; 1996) ( who was Gleitman 's student and advisee); Bloom,\nPaul and Keleman, Deborah ( 1995), and many others. \n\n \n\nAs early as 1957 as cited above, Brown already found out that\nchildren are able to use syntactic cues to learn words.\n\n\nHe conducted an experiment with kids whereby he presented the word\n\"  sib  \" in different structures.\n\n\nThe experiment went like this: To a group of about two-year kids, he\nasked:  Do you know what it means to  sib  ? \n\n\nThen he presented a picture and said:  \" This is\nsibbing.\" \n\n\nIn the second sentence structure, he presented the word \"\n sib  \" as a count noun.\n\n\nHe said  \" This is a  sib  .\" \n\n\nIn the third sentence structure, he presented the word \" \nsib  \" as a mass noun and said  \" This is sib.\n&rdquo; \n\n\nAfter such presentations, he asked those children questions that\ncalled for the answer in each sentence structure like  Show me \nsibbing  , a  sib  , and  sib   ( based on a\ngroup of pictures).\n\n\nThe results showed that children as young as two were already\nsensitive to the syntax of these words. \n\n \n\nNow what about Lila Gleitman, what does she have to show\nregarding word learning in relation to syntactic cues?\n\n\nIn her 1992 paper ( albeit she also worked previously on the same\ntopic with Landau, for example, with another Gleitman, H. ( maybe her husband\nand others) entitled \" structural sources of verb meanings \"\n, she explains through an experiment that children from 16 to 19 months are\nable to use syntactic cues as aids to learning or acquiring verbs.\n\n\nBut before this she begins her paper by quoting Locke ( 1690/1964\nbook no: I forgot) who says that people learn by observing or looking at\ntheir environment.\n\n\nWhile acknowledging that this is true, in fact, this idea is still\nfollowed up to now, Gleitman says that it cannot fully account for the\nprocess of early language acquisition.\n\n\nTo explicate her point, she cites the case of the blind and the\nsighted children who undergo the same process in language learning early in\ntheir lives.\n\n\nShe asks the question of how do we explain the case of the blind\nchild who learns the same words like the sighted children?\n\n\nClearly, observing the environment or learning by perception is not\nenough and does not guarantee language learning.\n\n\nShe therefore combines observation and the use of syntactic\nbootstrapping as a means by which children learn words.\n\n\nSyntactic bootstrapping is a procedure whereby children focus on the\nstructure or the position of where the word, for example a verb, occurs.\n\n\nShe also discusses semantic bootstrapping.\n\n\nThis comes to play when children perceive the meaning of words via\nperception.\n\n\nSo when the children already know the meaning of words, they still\nuse the syntactic cue to aid them in finding the meaning of the target verb\nthey are given.\n\n\nThus Gleitman says semantic bootstrapping comes at the end of\nsyntactic bootstrapping, hence she titles her paper \" structural\nsources of verb meanings \" , for clearly, the sources are more than\none.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "8c21247c-1524-4768-a854-b3ce1de239e9", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.129529+00:00"}

Tan said there was still part of the growth left adhering to one\nof the parts inside the abdomen.\n\n\nAnd chemotherapy would be the only solution to hinder the growth.\n\n\n \n\nJM was given \" Zadec \" by Dr. Javelosa for 2\nmonths.\n\n\nAnd he 's been eating well lately.\n\n\nJM and Jojo are doing well in school.\n\n\nMom has been the one tutoring him because that 's what he wants.\n\n\nHe was pick out by his teacher to <del> do </del-> present some\noratorical piece in a contest.\n\n\nI 'm getting him a USLS bag for the stroller because the knapsack\nisn't suited for the stroller.\n\n\nWe put a temporary basketball post with ring near the garage for them\nto play with.\n\n\nThe kids play rough now. \n\n \n\nJerivel this morning asked me before I headed home from my 16\nhour duty, if I was going to send you a letter.\n\n\nI said yes but maybe later during the month.\n\n\nHe asked me if you are to come home at the end of the month of\nAugust, and I said I don't know.\n\n\nBut if you do come home even later on, he said not to forget to give\nhis brother a call before, regarding to the  pasalubong  if\nthere are any. \n\n \n\nI have been staying inside the four corners of the room most of\nthe time watching television.\n\n\nIt would be nice to have somebody to talk to in the room.\n\n\nThe kids also spend most of the time watching their cartoon movies\nafter school.\n\n\nWe talk only when they encounter some conflict with each other or\nwhen we 're at the table eating except if I 'm free on weekend we never fail\nto go to the other house. \n\n \n\nIting has classes until eight in the evening.\n\n\nMaybe you know about that already but I don't have anything to tell\nyou about anymore that you don't already know.\n\n\nAh!\n\n\nI just remembered this.\n\n\nJoanne is planning to go to Cebu and stay there.\n\n\nThat 's what I heard from Jerivel and Alex.\n\n\nShe 's hiring Alex with his driver to take her to Cebu with Jerivel\nto tag along.\n\n\nThey 're even inviting me to go with them but I don't think it 's a\nvery good idea.\n\n\nI don't want to get into any hot water.\n\n\nI have a lot of that around the house, which I don't know which to do\nfirst.\n\n\nNow that is pure  tsismis  . \n\n \n\nToday is the 31st of July.\n\n\nIt was great to hear from you.\n\n\nAfter you called, I sure wasn't able to go back to sleep.\n\n\nAnyway, the short talk was very rewarding.\n\n\nI ate lunch with JM and Mom and later on retired to catch some sleep\nbut nothing happened.\n\n\nInstead I just watch TV and saw a short clip on the cable about a\nsmall tool with a hundred uses.\n\n\nThe name of the tool was \" SKEWDRIVER \" .\n\n\nIt 's a screwdriver and a socket wrench in one.\n\n\nIt was not stated as to how much it cost to acquire it.\n\n\nBut if it is not expensive, could you get me one?\n\n\nDon't worry about the weight because it is a very small tool wherein\nyou could put the whole container into your back pocket.\n\n\nIf you want to know another thing, my wallet, which is usually thin,\nhas incurred a hole from the tear and wear.\n\n\nAlex and Rhea hasn't broken the news to Rhea 's father yet about the\nmarriage that they are planning.\n\n\nI told him not to take a lot of time off with this thing because the\nbaby can't wait.\n\n\nThey ought to know about it as early as possible otherwise they 'll\nknow about it from some other person which wouldn't be nice to know from.\n\n\n \n\nI already mentioned to you that only one house help stayed with\nus longer than expected.\n\n\nAnd that is Besing.\n\n\nWe have for the meantime three other house help.\n\n\nAnd they are the following: Teopista ( gardener/  lavandera\n ) , Rosalie ( all around house help), and Liselle (  yaya\n ) .\n\n\nWell, this is all for now.\n\n\nI 'll just call  Tita  Reggie to verify the news\nabout your coming home.\n\n\nI have to prepare to go to work now.\n\n\nWE LOVE AND MISS YOU.\n\n\nBYE. \n\n\nJoey \n\n\n\n\nMarch 6, 1995\n\n\nDear Gloria,\n\n \n\nJojo has improved a lot in school since the 3rd quarter.\n\n\nFrom the 6th in line in their class - he 's now\n#2 - with an average of 95.6.\n\n\nHis grades are 2-95 & 4-96. \n\n \n\nLast Friday, JM & I went to see the Cultural Show participated\nby the Prep - Grade 4.\n\n\nJojo again sang & did the action pretty well - with confidence and\ngrace.\n\n\nHe only decided to join the show last Feb.\n\n\nJoey & I respected Jojo 's decision not to join the show way back\nNov. 94.\n\n\nThe \" theme &rdquo;

Maria &  Bill Bersamin\n .\n\n\nBetween us,  indi ako believe sa kay  Bill  \nfor this role as he can't really sing.\n\n\nBut Gabby chose him.\n\n\nPete Delfin, who can really sing, withdrew because he was given such\na minor role.\n\n\nAnyway, I hope it is still a success because the Singapore alumni\nare financing this.\n\n\nAnd for the sake of my son who labored over the script. \n\n \n\nI 'll write you a shorter letter via e-mail.\n\n\nAnd I hope you will send a reply soon enough.\n\n\nDon't give the excuse of no time.\n\n\nMake time!\n\n\nTake it easy and do your work!\n\n\nRegards from the residents of C-12. \n\n\nLove,\n\n\nReggie \n\n\n\n\nNov 10, 1996\n\n\nDear Laureen\n\n \n\nHello!\n\n\nIt was really nice to see you again!\n\n\nI hope your stay here in the Philippines and the visit to LaSalle\nwas enjoyable ( if not nostalgic.).\n\n\nIt was really a relief for me that you did answer my letter despite\nof the fact that I did not receive it ( it must be return address.).\n\n\nI thought that you really did not take notice of it and thought that\nI was really silly ( sorry I 'm paranoid about this.). \n\n \n\nAnyway it is really nice to see that good old Mam Velasco did\nnot change a bit.\n\n\nSo you are back now there, how are you doing?\n\n\nHow about the people there and the education?\n\n\nI bet you can talk Japanese quite fluently already.\n\n\nHow much longer will you be studying in Japan?\n\n\nAfter you graduate will you be teaching  Zen \nBuddhism in Japan?\n\n\n( Cool!)\n\n\nAre those Japanese people easy to get along with?\n\n\nSo, what do you do now for recreation?\n\n\n( I feel like I 'm doing an autobiography of you.) \n\n \n\nThere is one thing that really makes me curious about your\nsituation there in Japan.\n\n\nIsn't that your personal philosophy in life is existentialism and\none of the main points of that belief is individualism?\n\n\nAs far as I know Japan is the country of conformity and tradition.\n\n\nHow do you react to that?\n\n\nOr is the situation there not as bad as I think it is. \n\n \n\nYou see I 'm also planning to study in Japan like you.\n\n\nAfter I graduate I will attempt to enter a Japanese university and\nstudy Advertising.\n\n\nI believe that I 'm a very idealistic, unsuppressed, happy person\nand I are really concerned that the Japanese society in general and the\nUniversity atmosphere in particular might harm my individuality.\n\n\nI hate drinking, cigarettes, not discussing a point with the\nprofessor and not laughing during funny movies.\n\n\n( The typical Japanese does all of this and society seems to expect\nthem to.)\n\n\nThere is a saying in Japan that goes  \" The nail that\nsticks out must be hammered down. &rdquo; \n\n\nWell I like to  \" stick out. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nAnyway thanks for taking time for reading this letter.\n\n\nI really hope that you answer back.\n\n\nMy regards to you and your friends there.\n\n\nGod bless you man. \n\n\nSINCERELY YOUR STUDENT,\n\n\nRyan\n\n \n\nP.

{"text": "7-26-96\n\n\nDearest  Tita  Love & Papa,\n\n \n\nHello!\n\n\nMy 10-day leisurely tour in Geneva has given me enough time to write\nthis letter & start my  \" kwentos &rdquo;  about my\ngrand tour.\n\n\nMy stay here has been very restful so far.\n\n\nIn fact, I even visited a nearby public indoor pool to \"\nrecharge &rdquo; myself.\n\n\nIt was great to be able to swim again after almost 2 weeks.\n\n\nSwimming always rejuvenates me. \n\n \n\nI 've met four  Pinoy  friends here other than my\nformer student.\n\n\nThey all have computer-related jobs; four, ( including my former\nstudent) work for WHO & the other one for the U.N.\n\n\nThey 're only in their early 20s but already very successful &\nearning very well. \n\n \n\nAnyway, let me start my account of this trip from the beginning.\n\n\n \n\nI left Waseda as early as 6:30 a.m. & took the airport limousine\nbus to Narita.\n\n\nI think I was the very 1st passenger bound for Madrid who checked in\nbecause only empty chairs kept me company for a while at the waiting area.\n\n\nThe plane took off at 10:30 a.m. for its first destination - -\nMalaysia.\n\n\nI was also in transit in Dubai at almost midnight & Istanbul at\naround 5 a.m.\n\n\nEach airport had a \" personality &rdquo; of its own.\n\n\nI took every opportunity to inspect a new place & get a glimpse of\nanother culture as reflected in their respective airport.\n\n\nI saw many interesting-looking people.\n\n\nIt was a very enriching experience that 's why I didn't mind all that\nstopover; not to mention the food also kept pouring in - -  walang\nkatapusang kainan  !\n\n\nThat almost-30-hour flight was enough to give me all those unwanted &\ndreaded flabs. \n\n \n\nThe long & exhausting trip however took its toll on me when I\nfinally landed in Madrid.\n\n\nI went to my hotel by bus & subway, checked in, had lunch, sauntered\naround Goya Ave. & its surrounding streets.\n\n\nWhen Madrid took a  siesta  , I did, too.\n\n\nThe only problem was that, I woke up on the next day already.\n\n\n  ( Natawa talaga\nako.)  \n\n \n\nMy hotel accommodation was a big surprise.\n\n\nI only realized I was staying in a 4-star hotel when I got there.\n\n\nI simply chose the least expensive from the list my travel agent\nprovided.\n\n\nThat important information I took for granted.\n\n\n(  Hindi naman siguro isasama sa listahan ang lungga ng daga 'no!\n )\n\n\nSo I chose Convention Hotel.\n\n\nAnd what a pleasant surprise indeed!\n\n\nI prepared myself for something less considering my budget\nconstraints.\n\n\nI paid &dollar;62/night in that hotel.\n\n\nI definitely got my money 's worth. \n\n \n\nThe next stop was Paris, which became more astounding as days\npassed by.\n\n\nMy first day was a bore.\n\n\nI must have been tired from the 13-hour trip from Madrid though my\ncabin was comfortable.\n\n\nI arrived in Paris at 8:05 a.m. & checked her out right after lunch.\n\n\nI went to see Bastille,  Republique  & the\nimpressive  La Basilique du Sacre-Coeur  ( which was very\nnear my hotel).\n\n\nThen, I called it a day.\n\n\nThe next 5 days proved to be more enjoyable however.\n\n\nI seized every moment & maximized my  \" Paris Visite\n&rdquo;  pass which gave me unlimited access to all the metro\ntrains & buses.\n\n\nOn my last afternoon I took the train to Versailles & checked out the\nEiffel Tower again on my way home.\n\n\nAs for meals, I discovered an inexpensive chicken restaurant right\ninside the LOUVRE & had lunch there almost everyday.\n\n\nIn Bastille was also a nice Indian-Mexican restaurant where I\nbefriended an amiable French waitress.\n\n\nI gave her a tip but not before I politely asked if that practice was\npermissible, because in Tokyo it 's not allowed.\n\n\nAnyway, I also discovered some inexpensive grapes in Bastille.\n\n\nI bought 2 kilos and ate to my heart 's content.\n\n\n(  Hayy.\n\n\nsarappp!  )\n\n\nOn the 6th day I headed for Geneva via Eurail. \n\n \n\nI 'm yet to see how the second class train accommodation is like\nbut I have no regrets about having taken the first class Europass ( valid in\n4 countries) as the seats are very comfortable & with enough leg room.\n\n\nHowever, Milette & I will take the plane together from Rome to\nLondon.\n\n\nI decided to just fly instead of travel to the U.K. by Eurail again.\n\n\nI would have had enough of it by that time.\n\n\nBesides, it will be an extremely hectic schedule in Italy.\n\n\nI anticipate myself to be on my last leg by the time I 'm ready to\nleave the land of  fettuccini  .\n\n\nThe faster I get to my next destination, the better & the sooner I\ncould recharge.\n\n\nIt will be another leisurely trip in the U.K. as I 'll spend the most\ntime there.\n\n\nI will definitely see Alex Krotov because he requested me to purchase\nsome MO computer disks for him from Tokyo. \n\n \n\nHe promised to show me around.\n\n\nHe might even bring me to Sheffield where he presently resides.\n\n\nHe & I have kept in touch via e-mail.\n\n\n( Isn't technology really amazingly convenient?)\n\n\nHe plans on having a heart-to-heart talk with me regarding Heidi (\nour American friend/former dormmate).\n\n\nYou see, he really likes her but Heidi is letting the age gap get in\nthe way of a potential romance despite the fact that the feeling is mutual.\n\n\n( <Indig> Hayy naku  .\n\n\nThese ordinary mortals!\n\n\nHow much longer will I have to deal with them?\n\n\nheh, heh, heh,  ) \n\n \n\nOh, I forgot to mention my observation,  i.e. \n, neither the subway in Madrid nor Paris even comes close to Tokyo 's.\n\n\n(  Geneva only has buses, trams; no subway.)\n\n\nTokyo still has the cleanest, most well lit, well-ventilated,\nwell-manned, efficient, orderly, systematic, high-tech, sophisticated &\ntourist-friendly subway - - to my surprise!\n\n\nI thought Europe 's would be comparable.\n\n\nDeep inside I was proud & happy that an Asian country beat Europe at\nleast in that aspect. \n\n \n\nIncidentally, you ought to be proud of me, too.\n\n\nI got to my hotel both in Madrid & Paris without having to take a\ncab.\n\n\nI just took the bus and/or the subway, deciphered the city & subway\nmaps, and  voila  , I was there! (  Nahasa na ako\nsa subway sa Tokyo, eh  .)\n\n\nI was familiar enough with how the subway worked that taking a cab\nwas no longer necessary even if my location was entirely new.\n\n\n( Luggage is the only perennial problem.)\n\n\nAlthough naturally, \" getting there &rdquo; took me a longer\ntime than if I were familiar with the place.\n\n\nJust the same, I found my way  in Madrid & Paris without a hitch & for less cost at that.\n\n\nTravelling alone in a strange place is a good way to heighten &\nimprove one 's sense of direction. \n\n \n\nNow I 'm here in Geneve - - so far, the most expensive city I 've\nvisited in Europe.\n\n\nParis is surprisingly even cheaper.\n\n\nAnd the conversion rates of French & Swiss  francs\n are far from each other.\n\n\nThe yen is relatively strong in both countries though.\n\n\nThe  yen  is really powerful; the only Asian\ncurrency acceptable for exchange in Europe.\n\n\nHowever, I left Tokyo with at least 5 different, very colorful\ncurrencies in my wallet.\n\n\nWith the exception of &yen; and US&dollar;, the rest were alien to\nme. \n\n \n\nLanguage?\n\n\nNow that is another thing!\n\n\nWhen I got to Madrid, I was still somehow in my  Nihongo\n speaking mode so that instead of saying  \" Gracias,\n&rdquo;  I caught my self sometimes replying  \"\nArigato. &rdquo; \n\n\nBy the time I had adjusted to Spanish, it was already time to leave\nfor France.\n\n\nSuddenly I was already hearing  \" Bon Jour &rdquo;\n and  \" Merci &rdquo;  instead of\n \" Hola &rdquo;  &  \" Muchos Gracias.\n&rdquo; \n\n\nWith my  Nihongo  , & of course English, still\nvery much intact in the right hemisphere, my brain was beginning to get a\nshort circuit with all this very swift shift in language-processing.\n\n\nThank God, in Geneva, my French \" lessons &rdquo; get an\nextension.\n\n\nOne nice thing about leaving Tokyo for a while though is that\neverything I read is again written in Roman alphabets.\n\n\nI am \" literate &rdquo; here somehow.\n\n\nIt would probably have been a different experience had I been\ntravelling with a companion who could speak a language familiar to us both.\n\n\nBut I travelled  alone  for 9 days.\n\n\nNow, there are people to communicate with in both English & Tagalog.\n\n\nNo more danger of getting a brain short circuit.\n\n\nBut I still encounter  Nihongo  everywhere I go -\nthe Japs are everywhere in Europe. \n\n \n\nBy the way, you might think I brought everything in cash.\n\n\nNope!\n\n\n( Or else my Canadian friend, Sarah, wouldn't be able to sleep!)\n\n\nI brought some traveller 's checks, though too.\n\n\nI didn't have time to apply for a credit card though as I was busy\napplying for 5 visas & preparing for my dread oral & written report.\n\n\nI had to apply for a Turkish transit visa at the last minute, which\nthe Istanbul airport staff didn't even bother to check.\n\n\n(  Hay, naku!  )\n\n\nI was likewise very busy packing because I checked out of my room.\n\n\n( I didn't want to pay US&dollar;600 for a room I 'll not occupy for\n6 weeks.\n\n\nI put all my stuff in the dorm 's trunk room instead.\n\n\nI 'll probably have a new room  when I return -\n- which I don't mind at all!)\n\n\nPlus, I had a part-time job until the night before I left.\n\n\n(  Sagad-sagad talaga!\n\n\nMatindi!  ) \n\n \n\nHowever, I 'm now having a spectacular vacation & enjoying the\nfruits of my labor.\n\n\nParis was very beautiful!\n\n\nMadrid was like a mini-Paris.\n\n\nGeneva 's like home because I could just stare at the walls all day\nif I want to.\n\n\nIn  fact, I woke up rather late this morning.\n\n\nIt 's also here where I was able to do my laundry.\n\n\nI 'll iron my clothes before this day ends. \n\n \n\nMy friend & I tried this  Pinoy  restaurant\nnearby.\n\n\nNow I have to return because the owner 's daughter wants to\ninterview me on my philosophical, sociological,  etc. \nviews on a topic she 's researching on for her thesis  ( yata)\n .\n\n\nWe had a little discussion already as an introduction.\n\n\nShe casually asked about my opinion over dinner.\n\n\nBut now, she wants a formal, longer & recorded discourse on the\nmatter.\n\n\nI thought \" why not? &rdquo;\n\n\nSo, I agreed to her proposal.\n\n\n( Well. ... I guess I can never really take a complete break from\nphilosophy.) \n\n \n\nI know that both of you have visited Europe, but you never\nmentioned anything about having gone to Switzerland.\n\n\nHave you?\n\n\nThis place is so quiet.\n\n\nThere are very few cars.\n\n\nThere 's not much tourist attractions but the Swiss chocolates & the\nwatches are enough to drive one crazy.\n\n\n( The chocolates!\n\n\nOh my God!\n\n\nThey look so luscious & tempting!)\n\n\nIf Geneva were only my last stop, I would buy tons & tons of Swiss\nchocolates.\n\n\nBut I 'm not even halfway through in my European sojourn.\n\n\nAnd the most difficult part of my itinerary is yet to come - -\nItaly!\n\n\nSo I guess you 'll just have to \" put up &rdquo;  & content yourselves with \" Cadbury 's \" when I\nreturn in September. \n\n \n\nNow, seeing all of you again is something I agogly look forward\nto.\n\n\nI 'm still here & touring Europe but I am already thinking of &\nexcited about that.\n\n\nPlease don't tell the Abrenicas I 'm taking a vacation there if you\nbump into them in church.\n\n\nNobody from La Salle knows yet.\n\n\nI want to surprise my friends.\n\n\nI 'll arrive not later than Sept. 4, depending on which flight I 'll\ntake.\n\n\nI 'll definitely let you know through Milette via e-mail.\n\n\nWhen I return to Tokyo on August 26 or 28, I 'll be harassed & busy\npacking again - - this time for the Philippines!\n\n\nI still remember that thing on papa 's door ( or is it wall?) which\nsays,  \" No matter where you may roam, the best part is coming\nhome. &rdquo; \n\n\n( INDEED!) \n\n \n\nToo bad about the passengers on TWA flight 800!!!\n\n\nAs for us, the living, we will continue to  \" seize the\nday. &rdquo; \n\n\nHOPE YOU 're HAVING A GREAT TIME AS WELL!\n\n\nRegards to everyone!\n\n\nSEE YOU ALL IN SEPTEMBER!\n\n\nAnd  I MEAN IT  . \n\n\nLove,\n\n\nLAUREEN\n\n \n\n( P.

a message\nthrough e-mail.\n\n\nDO IT!\n\n\nDO IT!\n\n\nDO IT!\n\n\nThen, when he sends you e-mail messages print it out and keep it in\nyour wallet.\n\n\nI can vouch for the fact that Jollibee is still orange.\n\n\nAnd Ronald McDonald is still red. \n\n \n\nAnyway, the ABS-CBN Christmas party was a blast.\n\n\nOur department won first prize in the inter-department presentation.\n\n\nWe won PH&peso;15,000!\n\n\nAlso, many people in our department won in the raffle.\n\n\nRamil won a trip for two to Hongkong.\n\n\nPatrick won a 21-inch TV.\n\n\nPat-P won PH&peso;50, 000.\n\n\nAnd I was supposed to have won a mini-compo.\n\n\nBut I wasn't there to claim the prize so technically it has been\nforfeited.\n\n\nBut my friends here are trying to get it for me.\n\n\nSo, I 'll update you on that. \n\n \n\nPat-P was saying  kanina  how much blessings she\nreceived this year.\n\n\nI, too, have counted my blessings.\n\n\nThe London trip being the biggest.\n\n\nNext, my new car. .\n\n\nThen my merit increase... so many. .\n\n\nIt 's true that you have to go into some sort of suffering for\npurification before receiving blessings.\n\n\nI guess it makes it more valuable than receiving them regularly.\n\n\nAlthough I never discount the fact that I make it home everyday\nunscathed.. .\n\n\nMatthew takes care of me so well.\n\n\nI light candles for him everytime I go to Mass.\n\n\nMass... that reminds me...\n\n\nI sang for the Immaculate Conception Mass last Friday ( day of the\nABS Christmas party)...\n\n\nThe priest wanted the common  Ama Namin  to be sung...\n\n\nMidway through the Mass, I realized that I did not know anymore the\ntune of the common  Ama Namin  . .\n\n\nPANIC!\n\n\n Naghatak pa ako ng tao para lang masundan ko ang tune.\n\n\n\nStrange. \n\n \n\nYour letter miraculously arrived 5 days after you posted it.\n\n\nI think  narinig ka yata sa complaint mong two weeks siya\nhanggang makarating sa akin. \n\n\nI was doubly surprised to know the sweater reached you only in two\ndays.\n\n\nDON'T MACHINE WASH THE SWEATER.\n\n\nHand wash it.\n\n\nI wanted to get you a brighter colored one but all the other colors\nwere so drab.\n\n\nAlso, I wanted to write you a note but I was so busy and tired that I\njust stuffed it into the envelop and left it with the  concierge\n .\n\n\nAnyway, enjoy. \n\n \n\nWe 're looking for the  kweba  .\n\n\nIt 'll be ready when you arrive.\n\n\nSee you soon, if not later. \n\n\nLove,\n\n\nMilette \n\n\n\n\n02 January 1996\n\n\nLaureen Velasco\n\n\n169 Waseda Hoshien 1-414\n\n\n2-3-1 Nishiwaseda\n\n\nShinjuku-ku, Tokyo\n\n\nJapan\n\n\nDear Laureen,\n\n \n\nIt was nice hearing your voice again and talk to you without any\ntime pressure from an unsympathetic public telephone. \n\n \n\nI 'm very happy at the opportunities that are opening for you\nwith this Japan thing.\n\n\nJust like Joy, who 's had to work hard for all the things she has\nnow, you deserve everything you can get your hands on.\n\n\nI 'm just worried about Fanny, though... she wants many things but\ntrue to her form, she 's going about it in the wrong ways.\n\n\nEven if you say  na  she should not \" consume\n&rdquo; me, there will always be a well of affection-  cum\n - friendship that I will automatically draw from from time to\ntime.\n\n\nBut I can't help feeling angry and sad that someone whose \nfacade  is strong can be very unreasonably weak with stuff that\nneed fortitude and strength. \n\n \n\nAs for the movies that you are offering to look for, \nhindi ko pinapahanap ang mahahanap dito  .\n\n\nRemember that war movie I 've been looking for for the past 20\nyears?\n\n\nWell,  baka may makilala kang expert sa war movies at\nma-identify niya ang cine.\n\n\nYung malaking problema diyan ay hindi ko na nga alam kung ano ang\ntitle, hindi ko pa kilala ang actor!\n\n\nAno ba 'yan?\n\n\nAnyway, ma-swerte ka naman, heto ang story  ...\n\n\nThe main character ( let 's call him \" Joe \" ) is\nestablished as a criminal and is in prison ( first scene).\n\n\nHe is scheduled to be executed by guillotine.\n\n\nHe is brought to the guillotine and he goes on an existential\ntirade...\n\n\n \" People think that death comes when the blade hits\nyour neck.\n\n\nThey 're wrong... death begins when they cut the collar off your\nshirt... when they lay you down on the plank... &rdquo; \n\n\n( It 's funny, after 20 years, I still remember the dialogue but not\nthe title nor actor).\n\n\nThen,  siguro, may lahing Filipino ang director,  the\ncompound is victim to a direct hit of a bomb  at si Joe lang ang\nnabuhay  .\n\n\nAnyway, he escapes and joins some underground force ( most likely\nFrench) and meets their \" head saboteur\".\n\n\nHe learns what the saboteur does and bonds with them.\n\n\nWhile all this is going on, the Germans ( the enemy) threatens to\nshoot 10 village men everyday until the saboteur surrenders himself.\n\n\n Hindi naman maka-surrender ang saboteur kasi nag-iisa siyang\nhope ng tao.\n\n\nMadami nang nag-sacrifice na sila daw ang saboteur pero tinatanong\nng Germans kung papaano sila mag-sabotage, hindi nila masagot  , so\nthe killings continue.\n\n\nSo, I just don't remember if the village people asked him to\nsurrender or he did it out of his own will but he surrenders.\n\n\nSo the German general was skeptical about Joe...\n\n\n Kasi marami na ngang nag-surrender pero fake.\n\n\nSo tinanong ng general si Joe kung papaano siya mag-sabotage.\n\n\n\nFor a split second, Joe had a choice whether or not to really\nsurrender and tell the general what he knows. \n\n \n\nVery Sartre-tric,  'di ba  ?\n\n\nExistential  angst  ...\n\n\nIn the end, he matter-of-factly relates how the sabotages are done\nand the last words of the movie  \" General, we have found the\nsaboteur. &rdquo; \n\n\nI find this movie a great teaching aid for our philosophy classes\n 'di ba  ?\n\n\nTo show what existential  angst  is really about.\n\n\nHow to distinguish between  angst  and \nexistential   angst  ... kids can't invoke\nexistential  angst  when they 're problematic with\npersonal problems... they invoke existential  angst  when\nthere is a choice whether to further the cause of oneself or one of\nmankind... that 's where existential  angst  comes in.\n\n\nI find this movie a perfect example  kasi  , he was a\nconvicted criminal... he escapes and is free... he was about to be\nexecuted... he is released from this sentence. .\n\n\nHe runs away like a coward...\n\n\nBut in the end he is a hero... wow... existential... \n\n \n\nSo, itinerary suggested by MLZ:\n\n\nEnter Europe via Rome - From Rome train to Florence - Train from\nFlorence to Venice - train from Venice to Milan - train from Milan to Geneva\n- train from Geneva to Paris - train from Paris to Calais - Eurail from\nCalais to London - Underground rail from London to Oxford and back - British\nRail from London to Edinburgh and back - Plane to Madrid - go around Spain by\ntrain ( wherever the wind takes you) - Plane from Madrid to Athens - meet\nMilette in Athens - Plane to Cairo \n\n\nOption one Cairo to Manila\n\n\nOption two Cairo to Bangkok - Bangkok to Hongkong - Hongkong to\nManila\n\n \n\nSounds good, eh?\n\n\nAsk Aeroflot to make you an itinerary and attach the costs so you\ncan decide how to go about your travels.\n\n\nAsk them to make arrangements for Eurail also.\n\n\nChoose the cheapest route.\n\n\n Huwag kang pa-balik-balik na route. \n\n\nTry as much as possible to travel in a straight line. \n\n \n\nI 'm asking my friend in London to take you in as part-time\nborder.\n\n\nWill advise you about this.\n\n\nShows to watch in London: 1. Sunset Boulevard - see if Elaine Paige\nis doing the show; 2. Miss Saigon; 3. An Inspector Calls ( if still on); 4.\nCats; 5. Phantom of the Opera - see if Simon Bowman is doing the show; 6.\nFive Guys Named Moe; 7. At least one Shakespearean play; 8.

Miss\nSaigon - Wednesday; 2. Sunset Boulevard - Thursday; 3. Cats - Saturday; 4.\nPhantom - Wednesday; 5. Blood Brothers - Thursday. \n\n \n\nAll shows have evening performances everyday except Sunday.\n\n\nYou can, for example, watch \" Miss Saigon \"\nWednesday afternoon then watch \" Phantom \" that same night.\n\n\nGet a map and chart the theaters, which are close to each other.\n\n\nYou can just walk from one theater to another.\n\n\nWhen you get to London, the first thing you do is make the rounds of\nall the theaters and buy the tickets.\n\n\nYou can sight-see in the morning.\n\n\n Tuhugin mo ang  Parliament plus Big Ben, Westminster\nAbbey, Tower of London - Tower Bridge, then take a cab to Buckingham Palace.\n\n\nThen when you go to see the shows, walk around before each show\naround Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly Circus, Oxford Circus and Leicester (\npronounced Lester) Square.\n\n\nThen Hyde Park and Pall Mall.\n\n\nOne day  balikan  to and from Edinburgh.\n\n\nFinished! \n\n \n\n Paris kaya ng four days.\n\n\nIntense lang nga ang sight-seeing. \n\n\nRome, at least 5 days.\n\n\n Venice kaya ng overnight. \n\n\n Florence kaya ng overnight. \n\n\nVery intense  lang talaga ang sight-seeing  .\n\n\n Parang hindi ka lang matutulog ng mahaba. \n\n\nAthens allot 3 days.\n\n\nCairo another three days.\n\n\nIf it is cheap enough allot 3 days each for Bangkok and Hongkong.\n\n\nThis plan should give you an idea as to how long your \"\nvacation &rdquo; will take.\n\n\nItinerize and advise initial plans  para maka-pag-plano din\nako  .\n\n\nThis year would be the best time to go to Hongkong as well.\n\n\nIn 1997, there will be a lot of people who will go to HK to witness\nthe turn-over.\n\n\nI don't think we 'd want to be there at that time.\n\n\nBesides, HK is now too congested with people, too polluted and dirty\nand damn hell expensive!\n\n\nSince two years ago, you don't go to HK to shop anymore.\n\n\n Ang mahal mahal na. \n\n\nIt 's not fun to shop there anymore.\n\n\nWhat 's worse, you can find everything in HK here in Manila.\n\n\n Parang wala ng  premium and motivation to go to\nHongkong  na  , except of course, to eat. \n\n \n\nWe will be transferring to the big building this week.\n\n\nMost likely, I 'll have e-mail there already.\n\n\nWe can communicate everyday  na  .\n\n\nExciting!\n\n\n Pati Internet mayroon din... \n\n\nWow, awesome...\n\n\nCool. \n\n \n\nSee you soon. \n\n\nLove,\n\n\nMilette\n\n\nP.S.

{"text": "06 December 1995\n\n\nDear friend,\n\n \n\nIt is a cloudy but Christmassy cool Wednesday.\n\n\nI started the day early bringing the children to school and hurrying\nback to join Thelma for breakfast where we talked about mostly about our\nactivities for the day.\n\n\nSoon I was off again, first to the bank to withdraw some cash, to Ever\nGrand Central in Caloocan for deliveries, to another bank to remit payment to\nour  loofah  supplier in General Santos City in Cotabato,\nand then finally to Dani Mae 's school to fetch her from her Kinder  class.\n\n\nWe were home in time for lunch with Thelma.\n\n\nAfter a brief afternoon nap, I spent the rest of the day reviewing the\nproduction schedule, preparing the next day 's deliveries, answering phone\ncalls and playing with Dani Mae. \n\n \n\nI have just described to you a sample of my present routine after\nleaving the corporate world as an employee for many years where my life has\nbeen a daily grind of commuting if not driving through traffic and keeping a\nregular 8 to 5 office hours five days a week. \n\n \n\nI resigned from ICLARM effective end of September, but it was only\nin early November did I finally leave when my replacement came.\n\n\nMy decision to resign was brought about mainly by the increasing\nneeds of our family business.\n\n\nThelma and I also felt I have been spending precious time ( four to\nfive hours daily) just commuting from Valenzuela to Makati and back.\n\n\nI consider this decision as a major transition in my life and just\nlike in many of life 's transitions, Thelma and I ( and even the children)\nare still adjusting to all the changes but enjoying every bit of them. \n\n \n\nThe present arrangement is working fine.\n\n\nThelma spends most of her time outside marketing, making client\ncalls, purchasing materials, and so forth.\n\n\nI stay home taking care of the office, overseeing the production and\npitching in as driver for Thelma and the children occasionally.\n\n\nOn some occasions, the two of us meet clients together to discuss\nbusiness proposals.\n\n\nIn any case, we feel we are now spending more time together than\nbefore. \n\n \n\nCome to think of it now, I am not alone in the family who is in\nsome sort of transition or another.\n\n\nRecently, Thelma discovered to her dismay that she could no longer\nread the small prints in a book, magazine or newspaper and is now reluctantly\nconsidering a change to bi-focals...\n\n\nPizza is in her last year in high school and is presently agonizing\nover what course to take and in what university to go to.\n\n\nShe is torn between taking a course in Accounting or Child\nDevelopment either at De La Salle, UST, or Miriam College...\n\n\nNico is experiencing growth pains as he enters early manhood and is\nanxious over the shift to a regular school next year ( he is now in a private\nsemi-tutorial school)...\n\n\nDana who will soon enter her teens is also in her last year in\nelementary school and is wondering whether she wants to go to a\nco-educational high school or stay at St. Theresa 's, an all-girls school...\n\n\nThen there is Dani Mae who is both anxious and excited about\ntransferring to a \" big &rdquo; school and start Prep. \n\n \n\nAt this point, I must admit I did not know what to say when I\nbegan to write this annual Christmas letter.\n\n\nI asked Thelma what she wanted me to include and she just said:\n \" Just tell them what has been happening to the family this\nyear. &rdquo; \n\n\nI started that first paragraph and suddenly realized I was talking\nabout my own transition. \n\n \n\nThey say that transitions are necessary as we journey through\nlife.\n\n\nThey give us time to reflect, to take stock of everything that is\ngoing on in our lives, to make us aware of life 's meaning so that we can\nlive more fully according to God 's plan.\n\n\nBut we all know that transitions are also difficult times.\n\n\nThese are times for decisions that can either make or break us.\n\n\nThese are times when we feel deeply the need for one another, for\nfamily and friends, for God. \n\n \n\nIn retrospect then, I just wanted to say:  \" This is\nwhat 's happening to the family.\n\n\nAll of us are in some sort of transition this year, but we are all\ngoing through them smoothly.\n\n\nBecause of these transitions we have become closer to one another, to\nyou and to the good Lord.\n\n\nThanks to all of you, your prayers and your concern.\n\n\nThis Christmas, we shall offer our masses and prayers for all of you,\nthat as you journey through your own transitions you too will be guided by\nHim Who on Christmas day became like one of us so that we may have a full\nlife. &rdquo;  \n\n\nLove and regards from all of us,\n\n\nDanny, Thelma & children \n\n \n\nWish we could get together.\n\n\nDo you have the time?\n\n\nHope everything 's fine.\n\n\nHappy Holidays! \n\n\n- Thelma \n\n\n\n\n01 December 2001\n\n\nDear friend -\n\n \n\n\" \" Can't Stop Christmas &rdquo; \" is\nMartin Nievera 's latest and frequently hummed song today.\n\n\nI just feel it expresses the mood of many at this moment as we count\nthe days before Christmas.\n\n\nYes, nobody or nothing can't stop Christmas.\n\n\nNot the traditional Grinch in our society, not the worsening economic\nsituation, not the kidnappings, not the war in Afghanistan nor the never\nending conflict in Mindanao, and not all the problems in our government\ntoday.\n\n\nChristmas is for all of us and it is worth waiting for.\n\n\nIf only to remind us about the Love made flesh.\n\n\nIf only to have the chance once again to get in touch with loved ones\nlike you as we do now. \n\n \n\nThe year 2001 started inauspiciously for us.\n\n\nIn the evening of January 22 this year, his birthday, Danny woke up\nas if his whole body and the room were spinning wildly.\n\n\nHe was so dizzy and unable to stand.\n\n\nHe fell from his side of their bed and literally crawled to the\nbathroom to throw up.\n\n\nAfter one hour with no relief, Nico drove him to the hospital with\nThelma while Pizza and Dana together with  Ka  Romy Jacobo, a\nneighbor, followed in another car.\n\n\nHe stayed confined for four days and was given several tests.\n\n\nThe diagnosis: vertigo.\n\n\nThe spinning sensation stopped after two days but not the dizziness.\n\n\nFurther tests revealed that his inner left ear was irreversibly\ndamaged by infection affecting his sense of balance, but fortunately not his\nhearing.\n\n\nThe ringing in his left ear (  tinnitus  ) also\ngot enhanced.\n\n\nFor months he tried all kinds of medicines and physical exercises his\ndoctors prescribed, but to no avail.\n\n\nWith no relief in sight, he decided to try Alternative Medicine last\nAugust and since then has been on acupuncture sessions twice a week.\n\n\nDanny is now very slowly but surely recovering.\n\n\nHis acupuncture sessions have been reduced to once a week last\nNovember.\n\n\nHe has also enrolled at the Center for Family Ministries at the\nAteneo for a Diploma in Family Counseling starting the second semester as\npart of his therapy. \n\n \n\nMarch 2001 was significant for the family.\n\n\nThelma reached another milestone as she turned 50!\n\n\nExcept for the inevitable discomforts of menopause, our golden girl\ncontinues to enjoy relatively good health this year.\n\n\nThank God for that!\n\n\nAside from managing the family 's  loofah \nbusiness, she continues to be very busy as ever.\n\n\nShe still has her choir group, her monthly outings with her De La\nSalle   barkada   , her occasional meetings with her\nhigh school classmates, her weekly charismatic prayer meetings and our\nCouples for Christ group.\n\n\nTo all these have been added her responsibilities as Coordinator (\nwith Danny) for the Family Ministries of our parish. \n\n \n\nMarch 2001 is also when Nico turned 20.\n\n\nNico is now in his last two terms in his course at De La Salle 's\nCollege of St. Benilde.\n\n\nHe is due to graduate with a degree in Business Management major in\nComputer Applications by the first term next school year.\n\n\nI am sure all of you who have followed Nico 's story will understand\nthat the whole family is looking forward with much anticipation to Nico 's\ngraduation from college. \n\n \n\nIn May, the whole family hied off to Puerto Galera in Mindoro for\na weekend of family bonding, swimming, card games, eating, sleeping and just\nplain relaxing.\n\n\nWe took the family van all the way to Batangas City port and from\nthere took a fast ferry to Puerto Galera Resort in the island of Mindoro west\nof Batangas.\n\n\nThe place actually fell short of our expectations as it offered very\nlittle in terms of swimming in clear water and white sand beaches just like\nBoracay.\n\n\nThe place is actually a haven for mountain-climbers, scuba-diving and\nsnorkeling that did not attract any of us.\n\n\nBut just the same, we made the most out of it.\n\n\nAfter all what was important was that the family was together. \n\n \n\nOn June 3 this year, it was Mae 's turn to celebrate her\nbirthday, her 11th.\n\n\nMae has grown much taller this year as evidenced by her outgrowing\nmost of her children 's clothes.\n\n\nShe now shares some of Pizza 's and Dana 's things to the\nconsternation of the two older sisters.\n\n\nShe is now in Grade V and continues to excel in her class.\n\n\nAs you might have guessed - - yes, she is a Harry Potter fan.\n\n\nShe has read all four Harry Potter books and was the most excited in\nthe family when the film came to theaters in Manila.\n\n\nTo date she cannot recall anymore how many times she has watched the\nfilm. \n\n \n\nJuly was another memorable month for us but especially for Dana.\n\n\nShe turned 18 last July 16!\n\n\nAnd as it was her wish, we gave a Debutante 's party for her last\nJuly 21 at Annabel 's Restaurant in place of a trip to the US.\n\n\n( The family picture that accompanies this letter was taken from that\nparty.)\n\n\nIt was a joyous occasion for us all.\n\n\nDana 's immediate relatives from Danny 's and Thelma 's families were\nall there.\n\n\nAnd so were her closest friends both from high school and from\nCollege of St. Benilde where she is now in her third year taking a course in\nHotel, Restaurant and Institutional Management. \n\n \n\nNovember 04, 2001 was Pizza 's special day when she turned into\na full-blown woman at 22.\n\n\nPizza, apparently has already found her true calling and career in\nlife.\n\n\nAnd we are so happy for her.\n\n\nShe is now a pre-school teacher at Waldorf Schoof of Manila ( a\nmember of the Waldorf Schools worldwide) and is immensely enjoying it.\n\n\nOn her spare time, she tutors children at the Kumon Center nearby\nand also manages to help out with our neighbors ' children with their class\nlessons here at home.\n\n\nShe also continues to help Thelma with the clerical needs of our\nbusiness and acts as Thelma 's personal assistant whenever she has the time.\n\n\n \n\nSo there.\n\n\nWe have once again brought you up to date with our lives.\n\n\nAs I said at the start of this letter, if only because of getting\nconnected with you once again, Christmas is worth waiting for.\n\n\nLet us continue praying for each other, for peace in the world, and\nfor inner peace within all of us.\n\n\nAllow us to hear from you, too.\n\n\nMALIGAYANG PASKO!  \n\n\nWith much love and regards,\n\n\nDanny, Thelma, Piz, Nix, Dan and Mae \n\n \n\nHermie texted me to say she 's missing our group sojourn at\nDasma, & is looking forward to our next visit there.\n\n\nDo you think this is possible to organize next year?\n\n\nLet us keep each other in our prayers - happy holidays! \n\n\n-

{"text": "November 14, 1995\n\n\nDearest Laureen,\n\n \n\nHi!\n\n\nI 'm taking the time to write to you 'coz I was in DLSU the other day\nand I saw your name on the board and I thought of writing to you. \n\n \n\nSo, how are you?\n\n\nHow are your studies?\n\n\nI bet you 're busy catching up on your language classes or something\nlike that.\n\n\nIs it already freezing there?\n\n\nSigh!!\n\n\nI wish I could enjoy the snow with you. \n\n \n\nBy the way, my grandmother in the States is petitioning us\nfinally.\n\n\nI don't know how it 's going though.\n\n\nI think that we 're supposed to go there sometime in 1996 should\neverything be approved.\n\n\nHonestly, I want to go to the States already.\n\n\nMarc is there.\n\n\nWyny is there.\n\n\nAnd it 's probably a far cry from Manila life.\n\n\nI 'll keep you posted on this although I do plan to finish my M.A. by\nApril 1997  pa  .\n\n\nSo, we 'll see.\n\n\nIt 'll probably take ages before things get finalized with the\npapers.\n\n\nPlus I still have to take care of Carlo 's papers 'coz I want to take\nhim with me.\n\n\nMarc told me to list down what I really want in my life and it 'll\nprobably come to pass.\n\n\nPlus as long as I 'm dilly-dallying about my plans, nothing will\nhappen to them. \n\n \n\nI do plan to visit you in Japan though.\n\n\nIs it feasible to visit you?\n\n\nWill I have a place to stay in while I 'm there?\n\n\nIs it really expensive?\n\n\nLastly, is it worth spending for? \n\n \n\nWhat 's happening here?\n\n\nThe usual stuff:  jeepney  strikes, traffic, corrupt\npoliticians, bickerings,  etc. \n\n\nI think it really is best to immerse myself in books, movies and\ncross-stitching rather than go out and be subject to all these negative\nstuff.\n\n\nYup!!\n\n\nI really believe that it 's only here in the Philippines that these\nthings do happen. \n\n \n\nNothing exciting with my life.\n\n\nNo love life as well.\n\n\nI 'm just enjoying being myself and doing all these \" quiet\n&rdquo; things.\n\n\nOh, by the way, I 've started a morning exercise ritual already.\n\n\nIt 's the pits!!\n\n\nMy body was really making creaking sounds.\n\n\nYup!!\n\n\nI 'm not fit at the moment. \n\n \n\nThe new semester will prove to be a lighter load for me.\n\n\nAnd I think I 'll enjoy teaching my classes.\n\n\nI have one cute male student who happens to be a very polite man.\n\n\nI keep telling my friends that I 'll probably have sinful thoughts\nabout this person.\n\n\nHeh heh heh! \n\n \n\nAnyway, this will be all for now.\n\n\nDo take care of yourself, okay?\n\n\nI hope that you continue to have a grand time there.\n\n\nWrite when you can. \n\n\nWith much love and affection. ...\n\n\nAs Always,\n\n\nOdette \n\n\n\n\nFrom: Nina Marcelo-Bautista\n\n\nTo: \n\n\nDate: March 20, 2000\n\n\nSubject: Cosmic Journey\n\n \n\nTon and I discovered new things in Baguio which I would like to\nshare with you in case you visit the place again. \n\n \n\nLast weekend, we spent almost half-a-day at the Maryknoll\nEcological Sanctuary. \n\n \n\nThe place was developed only in the last two or three years and\nit 's been a regular destination of local and foreign tourists as well as\nschool children on their science, culture and religious field trips.\n\n\nBut how could these three - - - science, culture and religion - - -\nbe integrated in one outdoor activity? \n\n \n\nThat 's the pioneering work of the Maryknoll Sisters in Baguio.\n\n\nThe eco-tour we had is called \" \" Cosmic Journey\n&rdquo; \" .\n\n\nIt was such a wonderful experience for all of us, eight Ateneo\nteachers and Ton, and I would highly recommend that you arrange for the\nguided tour.\n\n\nWhat made it wonderful, at least for me, is not so much on knowing\nnew facts about the earth for many of these we already know, but on gaining\nnew insights about our lives, our environment, and most especially how God\nhad all along planned this evolution. \n\n \n\nWhen we were told \" \" cosmic &rdquo; \" ,\nwe immediately associated it with astronomy.\n\n\nTon and I thought what else could be new when we had seen the air and\nspace museum in Washington and the NASA in Houston.\n\n\nBut anyway, we kept our minds open and our disposition cheerful. \n\n \n\nLater as we went through the experience, we discovered that this\neco-tour is unique in the sense that it is natural science with spiritual and\ncultural recollection. \n\n \n\nAfter the 1991 earthquake, according to our tour guide Sr. Ann\nBraudis, the convent of the Maryknoll sisters was badly damaged.\n\n\nSo what they did was to capitalize on the ruins and on the natural\nlandscape of the hill on which the convent used to stand, and develop a\nnature trail with 14 stations.\n\n\nNot stations of the cross.\n\n\nEach station is like a garden corner where our guide engages us in an\namusing and insightful storytelling.\n\n\nEach garden station has either wooden benches or rocks to sit on,\nusually in a circular arrangement, with an object of interest at the center.\n\n\nHer stories usually revolve around this object. \n\n \n\nFor example, the fifth station is entitled \" \"\nMammals Arrive &rdquo; \" .\n\n\nIn that garden, there is an antique wooden sculpture of a mother\nelephant of about 3 feet high with a baby elephant beside it.\n\n\nTon was able to take a photo of this.\n\n\nWe sat on the big rocks surrounding these elephants, and like little\nchildren, listened to Sr. Ann 's story of the evolution of mammals millions\nof years ago.\n\n\nIn almost all the stations, she usually starts off with the\nscientific facts.\n\n\nThen she brings the discussion into a more soulful experience. \n\n \n\nAt this point, she drew out the values that were developed when\nmammals arrived.\n\n\nParenting.\n\n\nCaring for young ones.\n\n\nSensitivity to the family 's needs.\n\n\nAnd by this time, she was talking as if she 's giving a retreat to\neach of us and made us personally reflect on these values.\n\n\nShe paused every now and then, which made me wonder at the depth of\nher spirituality...\n\n\nThen she went further to say that they put the wooden elephants in\nthat garden for the public to know that elephants existed in the northern\nprovinces, probably even in the Cordillera mountains thousands of years ago!\n\n\nAnd it is so unfortunate that they have been driven to extinction in\nthese places.\n\n\nShe cited as evidence the indigenous artworks made by the early\ntribesmen.\n\n\nSomehow, she commented, it is difficult to explain how these early\npeople were able to carve these images if they had not actually seen them.\n\n\nAnd if I remember correctly, she also mentioned that fossils have\nbeen uncovered that make them believe all the more this theory.\n\n\nAnd when we recall that there are still elephants today in some\ncorners of Southeast Asia, and relate this to the theory of the land bridges\nthat connected the thousands of islands in the region, then it is no longer\ndifficult to convince us that elephants might have indeed been among the\nearly inhabitants of this place. \n\n \n\nSo that is another thing that makes Sr. Ann 's storytelling\ninteresting.\n\n\nShe contextualizes natural science history with the Philippine\nanthropological history.\n\n\nSo we get to appreciate our own country and culture. \n\n \n\nMoving from one station to another meant trekking up and down the\ngently-sloping hill and even crossing a suspension bridge with rope-rails to\nhold on and wooden steps to walk on!\n\n\nThat put a little excitement in the journey. \n\n \n\nWell, actually, for those with height problems, the architects\nmade the bridge secure by providing some steel support.\n\n\nNo longer indigenous but extra safety measures especially for\nchildren. \n\n \n\nBut before we crossed this bridge, we passed by the ninth and\ntenth stations, respectively called \" \" Early Humans Live in\nCaves &rdquo; \" and \" \" The Hunting and Gathering Age\n&rdquo; \" .\n\n\nHere we climbed up on firm steps of stone until we found ourselves\ninto a small Ifugao burial cave!\n\n\nEerie!\n\n\nAlthough the cave was man-made, it looks almost real.\n\n\nOur guide talked about rituals and burial practices, and their team 's\nplan to eventually \" decorate &rdquo; this cave with burial jars.\n\n\nEmpty, I hope.\n\n\nWe stayed inside only for a short time for which I am glad.\n\n\nNot much to see anyway, but so much to imagine anyhow. \n\n \n\nThen we climbed up further to a replica of the Tabon caves of\nPalawan.\n\n\nWe stayed here for quite awhile sitting on big stones.\n\n\nThe cave looked more hospitable.\n\n\nSr. Ann narrated to us how some early cavemen lived.\n\n\nIn all their primitiveness, she explained, early human beings\nappreciated beauty.\n\n\nOne can see it in the way they chose their dwelling places.\n\n\nThey chose to live in caves aesthetically designed by nature to be\npleasing to their eyes.\n\n\nThey also chose caves which face magnificent views like the blue\nsea.\n\n\nFacing the west, the Tabon men must have marvelled at the sight of\nthe awesome sunset at the horizon of the South China sea.\n\n\nLater we learned that Maryknoll has a research team engaged in\nextensive studies on the Tabon men. \n\n \n\nLiving and gathering together in caves, these early human beings\ndeveloped Language and rituals.\n\n\nSr. Ann brought the discussion deeper for us to realize the value of\nlanguage and communication.\n\n\nThe age of language and communication is one of the longest, dating\nback to these primitives up to today. \n\n \n\nBy this time, one would have noticed already that Sr. Ann uses\nso many hand gestures.\n\n\nOut of habit, I guess, since they normally relate with deaf\nchildren.\n\n\nI could also surmise that they bring these children to this place\nalso. \n\n \n\nAfter that, we walked along a narrow path and crossed the bridge\nI mentioned towards a sample Ifugao or Igorot village, with authentic Ifugao\nhuts!\n\n\nOne of these is elevated, though I can't remember if it was anchored\non a tree, and Sr. Ann invited us to climb it and rest inside it to have a\nfeel of how the early tribesmen lived.\n\n\nIt was ingenious how the natives designed the posts on which their\nhuts stood to prevent rats from climbing up. \n\n \n\nSr. Ann, by the way, is very energetic even though she must be\nin her late 40s or 50s.\n\n\nMy guess is that she 's an American who had long been stationed in\nthe Philippines.\n\n\nAnd by the way she talks, she must be in love with our country. \n\n \n\nThe small village only has three huts, each one perhaps\nrepresenting a design by a different tribe.\n\n\nSr. Ann said that they hired local old natives to work on these, so\nthey tried to be as faithful to the indigenous form and function.\n\n\nNeedless to say, the development of this nature trail was done with\nthe assistance of some consultants.\n\n\nAs an aside, part of the funds came from the sale of a small\nMaryknoll property in Quezon City. \n\n \n\nSo, that is only a preview.\n\n\nThe next time you are in Baguio, be sure to visit the Maryknoll\nEcological Sanctuary.\n\n\nDon't expect anything spectacular.\n\n\nNothing high tech. \n\n \n\nAt the entrance of this friendly mini-forest park, there is only\none rule written on a wooden board:  \" Those who enter here. ...\nEnjoy! &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nTheir brochure says  \" The Cosmic Journey is an\nexperience of the origins of the earth and its inhabitants. ... \n\n\nMore than a physical journey through a nature trail, it is a\njourney into our inner selves. .... challenges us to reassess our role and\nrelationship with the Universe, and to refashion our way of life in\nconformity with nature. &rdquo;  \n\n\nThis may sound deep but the Maryknoll sisters have a way of drawing\nthe children 's enthusiasm for non-formal experiential learning. \n\n \n\nBy the way, this is not a passive tour.\n\n\nDon't expect to just look and listen.\n\n\nThe tourists are encouraged to participate.\n\n\nIn fact, in the first station \" \" The Universe comes\ninto Being &rdquo; \" , Sr. Ann, as well as our group, was amusingly\nsurprised that Ton just suddenly walked towards the huge antique rusty\n \" batingaw &rdquo;  and tested if it still works.\n\n\nDonnngggg!\n\n\nIt works alright, the sister remarked.\n\n\nShe laughed at Ton 's childlike spontaneity and curiosity.\n\n\nShe said,  \" I 've been asking guests to come and try\nthis bell, and they are usually shy to do it. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThe guided tour only costs &peso;35.00 per head.\n\n\nReally cheap for an interesting experience.\n\n\nThe nature trail took us around 2 hours.\n\n\nAt the end of the journey, it is like having undergone a\nrecollection.\n\n\nIt connects God with nature and with culture. \n\n \n\nFor those interested, the telephone number of the Maryknoll\noffice in Baguio is ( 074) 442-4602.\n\n\nBe sure to ask about the schedule of their guided tour by one of the\nsisters.\n\n\nThey can also make their own schedules for you.\n\n\nIt is located at\n#27 Sto. Tomas Road, Campo Sioco.\n\n\nThat is near Legarda Road, just before you exit to the Marcos\nHighway.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nIt is safe for children, as long as there are accompanying\nadults.\n\n\nBut I don't know how young is their youngest visitor or how old is\ntheir oldest.\n\n\nYou can ask them that. \n\n \n\nThe Maryknoll office also has an art gallery, and they regularly\nchange their exhibits.\n\n\nThe theme is of course nature.\n\n\nWhen we were there we looked at the paintings of deaf children and\nphoto-exhibit by professionals including the famous BenCab.\n\n\nYou can buy these.\n\n\nOther features of the place include an Earth Resource Center,\nsmall-scale camping areas, seminar center, picnic area, and living facilities\nfor retreat or special workshop participants. \n\n \n\nFor instance this summer, their program includes \"\nEco-Vacation\", on April 11-14, \" Growth and Wellness Workshop Series\n&rdquo; on April 17-19, Earth Day Celebration on April 22 and the \"\nSanctuary Eco-Retreat &rdquo; on May 5-7.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "e17e2b0f-9d04-4015-a801-7715c5c40aae", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.138303+00:00"}

)\n\n\nOn the whole, the new life sounds pretty good to me.\n\n\nOf course there are the crammed and hectic four days of slow classes\nbut the long weekends should compensate.\n\n\nDoing your own laundry is a drudgery but it is small price to pay for\nnew experiences.\n\n\nWe 're too, too spoilt in the Philippines, that 's what I 've always\nmaintained.\n\n\nMissing people - - well, that 's the bigger price and not to be\nscoffed at.\n\n\nI don't have any solution to ease this, never had one in the 19\nyears I 've been away.\n\n\nThe fact that I 've been labelled \" loner \" does\nnot help - - even loners prefer some people and do miss them. \n\n \n\nSo what to do, how to handle a Big New Life?\n\n\nYou do the laundry and miss people and long for many familiar\nsounds.\n\n\nBut you also learn many new things, fascinating new nuances, gain\nnew insights. \n\n \n\nAnd you are grateful for the interesting life.\n\n\nPlease write. \n\n\nMuch love\n\n\nN\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 1994\n\n\nDear Tish:\n\n \n\nI trust you 've recovered from not having spent Christmas in\nManila and from missing Gabby Concepcion 's  \" quiet and private\nwedding &rdquo;  . \n\n \n\nAnyway by this time you will have discovered that one can miss\nthings and yet have a reasonably fun time.\n\n\nBesides, don't we need a quieter Christmas every now and then?\n\n\nMakes us remember what the day is all about.\n\n\nBut why am I delivering such an Epistle on your birthday?\n\n\nA bad habit.\n\n\nWhich means this old friend of yours hasn't ( may never) changed.\n\n\n \n\nIan sends his love. \n\n\nNorma \n\n\n22 Nov. 1994\n\n \n\nDear Tish,\n\n \n\nIan and I have just started our joint project - - a book on\npost-war executions of ( war) criminals.\n\n\nThe research has been most interesting.\n\n\nThe writing, as usual, is another matter.\n\n\nVery challenging, rather stressful.\n\n\nHowever, there 's much to learn and the old marbles are kept busy.\n\n\nWhat are your plans for Christmas?

{"text": "December 1, 1997\n\n\nDear Tish,\n\n \n\nI decided to write you as the year is too long to be cramped in a\ncard!\n\n\nThe year has its highs for us.\n\n\nFirst, Liesl 's 'special project' at the office - - handling the\ncaseload of the California State University campuses in the southland - -\ndemanded special attention and more time.\n\n\nShe also got promoted to a higher classification after a grueling exam\nand interview where she beat six more seasoned and older people; she now has\nto stand our teasing about being serious and dressing up more.\n\n\nLiz likes to wear sneakers and pretend she is still a student at UC\nSan Diego.\n\n\nBut she now makes the effort to sound older over the phone. \n\n \n\nAngela, 24, has gotten engaged to Steve Carpenter, a 27-year old\nhistory major, on Valentine 's day.\n\n\nSteve had gotten on his knees and had given her a bouquet of roses\nand in the middle of the bouquet was a fake velvet rose that doubled as a\nring box.\n\n\nThey are now preparing for their wedding next year at the Mission Inn\nin Riverside.\n\n\n( Her classmates had gotten married in Funky California fashion: at\nthe winery in Temecula, on a boat at Santa Catalina islands, in Las Vegas.\n\n\nThank God Angela and Steve chose to be married in a 200-year old\nchurch of St. Francis de Assisi, with a gold leaf altar that reminded her of\nthe Spanish churches in Manila.\n\n\nI don't think I can stand a wedding at the beach or in a winery.)\n\n\n \n\nTing graduated from the University of California at Riverside on\nJune 14, 1997.\n\n\nShe was done with the units, but the commencement march was in June.\n\n\nSteve 's parents, Ross and Cynthia Carpenter, drove from their Oxnard\nhome to Riverside just to see her graduate and have dinner with us at the\nCask N'Cleaver.\n\n\nSteve 's older brother Ron, who is working for his PhD and teaching\nat the University of Utah, also drove down to be with the family.\n\n\nFranz opened a bottle of Dom Perignon for the occasion.\n\n\nWe had sent her graduation announcements to relatives and friends:\nboth Arlene Talon ( Resti 's younger sister) and Jonathan Gatmaitan, Angela 's\ncousin now studying law at Pierce College in New Hamsphire, wrote back:\n \" I feel old seeing Tinker Bell 's graduation picture! &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\nTing had started working at the Alta Loma school district as a\nsubstitute teacher while keeping her job at a crafts store at the mall on\nweekends.\n\n\nShe really enjoys working with small children, who shower her with\npencil drawings and ask her if they can go home with her.\n\n\nThe drawback is that Ting usually looks so young that she is mistaken\nfor one of the students herself.\n\n\nIt is not unusual for Ting to come home with stories of how she was\nmistakenly taken for a junior high student herself. \n\n \n\nFranz and I celebrated our 29th wedding anniversary in June by\nspending a quiet weekend in Santa Barbara, which is my favorite weekend\nplace.\n\n\nThe Pacific Ocean in June is just so beautiful to look at.\n\n\nAt home, we started gathering our bumper crop of plums, peaches and\ngala apples.\n\n\nThe  loquat  and Asian pears did not do so well\nthis year.\n\n\nTing gathered the apricots and made dozens of jars of apricot jam,\nthe best we have tasted ever. \n\n \n\nCelia, on the other hand, is living dangerously.\n\n\nShe has been supervising the projects of Benckiser, the company she\nworks for, and taking trips to Europe where the manufacturing plants are.\n\n\nOnce, when Air France went on strike, Celia took a commuter flight\nfrom New York to Manchester to Paris.\n\n\nHer luggage was lost and she ended up being \" creative &rdquo;\nin her change of outfits for her meetings in Paris and the short stay in\nMonaco, where the plant is.\n\n\nWe called it Murphy 's Law on its roll for her.\n\n\nAnother time, she was in Barcelona for a few days and was scheduled\nto leave for London and she was mugged.\n\n\nShe had taken dinner with a friend and was walking back to the Hilton\nwhen someone came running, in a crouched position, hit her back and took her\nLouis Vuitton purse.\n\n\nShe started to run after the mugger, but her friend shouted, \n\" Celia, don't!\n\n\nHe might hurt you. &rdquo; \n\n\nShe was right, and Celia stopped.\n\n\nThe Hilton helped her get her credit cards canceled, secured the\nairline ticket for London and Celia went on her scheduled trip to London.\n\n\nMurphy 's Law worked overtime that time. \n\n \n\nOn my 50th birthday, Franz and I spent four days in Del Mar, my\nother favorite city.\n\n\nIt 's just so quiet and peaceful there and the old fashioned inn we\nstayed in is a stone 's throw from the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\nI did not need any consoling; I told everyone my age!\n\n\nI am looking forward to 60, maybe I will be a grandmother then. \n\n \n\nGinger and Samson have continued to grow.\n\n\nGinger, 3, is Steve 's dog.\n\n\nShe is a mixture of a dobie and a lab.\n\n\nHer mix had produced an elegant, highly intelligent lady, one who\nwalks gracefully and loves faithfully and guards fearlessly.\n\n\nHer soft brown eyes and light brown fur belie her determination - -\nto go after birds and the mailman, to get at your steak, to get you outside\nand play ball with her.\n\n\nSamson, 2, is Angela 's baby dog: all graceful trot, black fur with\ngray undercoat, and the audacity and curiosity of a muddy little boy.\n\n\nBoth dogs have been devoted to Steve and Angela.\n\n\nWhat is most touching is Angela 's devotion to both of them.\n\n\nShe takes very good care of them, brushes them regularly, takes them\nto the vet, and finds humor in everything they do.\n\n\nThe dogs have made her a better person.\n\n\nLiesl and I have done our share of dogsitting.\n\n\nWhen a dog who looked like Ginger came out on the cover of \"\nDog Fancy \" , we were triumphant:  \" Ginger is a cover\ngirl! &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nLate this year, both Joshua and John David left Manila to study\nabroad.\n\n\nJosh is at Fordham U for his masters in international economics; he\nlives in a Trump apartment building overlooking Central Park three blocks\naway from his school.\n\n\nJohn David is spending a year at the London School of Economics for\nhis masters in law.\n\n\nBoth girls, Geri and Gwen, are doing their residency in Philadelphia.\n\n\nJames is putting up his trading firm in Manila, Jonathan is in his\njunior year at law school in New Hamsphire and next year, Peter is coming out\nto get his doctorate.\n\n\nAll of Andres ' and Baby 's kids ' studies are almost over!\n\n\nExcept for the baby, Jerome.\n\n\nBen 's daughters are graduating: Genny from Rice University in\nHouston and Linette from Trinity School in Fort Worth.\n\n\nGenny is doing interviews for med school and Linette is looking\nforward to Georgetown for her college degree.\n\n\nCelia 's 2 daughters are both in school, Rosalyn at the University of\nNorth Carolina and Annabelle at Texas A&M.\n\n\nAnnabelle did something extraordinary we are all proud of: she\nattended the Marine boot camp in Paris Island and actually got through it\nall!\n\n\nShe now has a 4-year scholarship in college.\n\n\nAnnabelle 's guts and determination truly amazed all of us.\n\n\nEster 's sons are both working and Jeannette 's babies are all in\nschool. \n\n \n\nThis Christmas, Franz and I will be with his mother and brothers\nand their families.\n\n\nWe are hoping Veda will come and visit again, so we can all be\ntogether.\n\n\nTish, how are you?\n\n\nLife must be so hectic in Manila; I have not heard from you.\n\n\nNorma sent me a postcard from London and she says she will be back in\nSingapore before Christmas.\n\n\nTake care! \n\n\nOds \n\n\n\n\nJanuary 23, 2002\n\n\nDearest Tish,\n\n \n\nThis is Angela 's baby, Stevie, born June 6, 2001.\n\n\nI am enclosing a photograph of him taken more recently.\n\n\nI 'd probably be classified as a 'besotted grandmother' but I don't\nmind being called that.\n\n\nFranz and I and Liesl drive to Rancho Cucamonga, where Angela and\nSteve live, and take Angela out to lunch and shopping at the nearby Ontario\nMills.\n\n\nThis Saturday, though, Angela and Steve are watching a hockey game at\nStaples in LA, so we three are baby sitting the whole afternoon.\n\n\nHe is at a stage where everything goes to the mouth, and he always\nwants to take tentative steps, so he tires all of us. \n\n \n\nI do enjoy the baby but I marvel at the way Angela has taken the\nresponsibility of motherhood and has learned to juggle work and parenthood.\n\n\n Alam mo naman dito, Tish, walang yaya! \n\n\nAnd Angela insists on breastfeeding, so it 's double trouble!\n\n\nShe wakes up early, breastfeeds, pumps, bundles the baby to a\nbabysitter near the school where she teaches, and picks him up at 3:30 p.m.\n\n\nShe established a schedule so he and she take a walk, then she feeds\nhim, gives him a bath, and puts him to sleep by 8:30 p.m.\n\n\nSteve helps by doing part of the housework and looking after the baby\non Mondays when he does not work.\n\n\nParenthood is taken very seriously over here.\n\n\nFranz and I can only help so that the parents won't feel the burden\ntoo heavily.\n\n\nOn their third ( or is it fourth?) wedding anniversary, they are\ntaking a night off to be by themselves in Santa Barbara, so they are dropping\nStevie off at her mother-in-law 's house.\n\n\nWe get to take care of the dogs overnight. \n\n \n\nBoth Franz and Liesl have entered into the spirit of having a new\nmember of the family.\n\n\nFranz pushes the stroller when we are at the mall; once he even\namazed everyone by crawling on the floor!\n\n\n \" What a milestone, &rdquo;  so Liesl says.\n\n\n \n\nThis year, we were able to take off only a few times - to San\nFrancisco and San Diego.\n\n\nWe had scheduled a vacation in the east coast last October, but the\nSeptember 11 attack made us postpone the trip.\n\n\nWe hope to go and take our vacation this spring. \n\n \n\nDid I tell you that one of Andres ' sons, Joshua, works for\nCantor Fitzgerald?\n\n\nYes, the trading company that occupied four floors of the tower that\nwas completely demolished.\n\n\nFortunately, Josh works for another division in another building\nnearby.\n\n\nThey were immediately evacuated, but he said he saw flying limbs as\nhe went down the stairs.\n\n\nHe and his wife, Patricia Tuason-Pernia walked across the bridge and\ntook a ferry to NJ where an aunt lives.\n\n\nWe feel he was so traumatized by the event.\n\n\nThe apartment where they stayed was on the 10th floor, so he and\nPatricia had to go down the fire escape - ten floors! - because they were\ntold that there might be a gas leak in the building. \n\n \n\nCelia walked more than ten blocks to get home to NJ from her\nFifth Avenue office.\n\n\nShe tried to call a cousin of ours who lived in a co-op in\nManhattan, but Ofelia was vacationing in Nova Scotia. \n\n \n\nFe Wanner did call me several times from Victoria - before and\nafter her trip to Manila.\n\n\nShe enjoys traveling a lot. \n\n \n\nNorma dropped me a line last month.\n\n\nShe still divides her time between Sydney and Singapore.\n\n\nDid she tell you of her sister passing away?\n\n\nCancer took Erlinda.\n\n\nI still remember her - she is very pretty - coming by Philets to\ngive something to Norma. \n\n \n\nMy advanced birthday greetings - it is February, is it not?\n\n\nHow is La Salle these days?\n\n\nTish, my sister sent me a copy of \"  Toro\n \" .\n\n\nI was saddened by that film.\n\n\nIt is very real and it raises the issues of prostitution in the\nPhilippines - male, female and child.\n\n\nAnd I watched the film after reading about the most beautiful homes\nin the Philippines.\n\n\nLiesl had given me a book that featured the homes of the Zobels and\nBoy Santos and the others -  nakakaiyak naman iyong film. \n\n\n\nMy regards to everyone--\n\n\nOds\n\n \n\nP.S. Nicklas was taken from Niklas Lindstrom, the hockey player\nof the Red Wings.\n\n\nAngela is a hockey fan. \n\n \n\nPicture me with Stevie strapped to a \" Baby Bjorn\n\" - another name for a papoose - and Stevie hanging/dangling from my\nneck and chest.\n\n\nA regular baby kangaroo.\n\n\nWe go to the mall with Stevie.\n\n\nWhen he kicks his legs and flails his arms, I get a real work out.\n\n\n \n\n( I don't know what kind of paper this is, Liesl 's paper - but\nerasures don't work on this paper.)", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "18366003-0309-4d34-a0ff-08cc526ee1ba", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.141446+00:00"}
{"text": "July 26, 1997\n\n\nDear Presy,\n\n \n\nYour fax message came in bits and pieces as we were having\nproblems with connections here.\n\n\nIt is the rainy season and the telephone lines are \" crackling.\n&rdquo;\n\n\nBetter to shout at one 's neighbors to pass on the news.\n\n\nHowever with a pair of scissors and some tape I was able to\nreconstruct and pass on the good news to Dr. Carmen Beduya, the dean. \n\n\n1. The four of you are arriving Sept. 3 ( Wed).\n\n\n2. We have four  curriculum vitae  and the four\noutlines of presentations.\n\n\n3. Thursday Sept. 4 A.M. Tish, P.M. Isagani - - Eng/Lit; Friday Sept.\n5 A.M. Presy - Ed. Management; Saturday Sept. 6 A.M. P.M. Virgie - - Legal\nManagement.\n\n\n4. Dr. Beduya thinks a presentation in Pilipino would benefit us\nmost.\n\n \n\nIs Isagani 's presentation on English Lit.; can he have an input\non teaching/writing/researching Pilipino,  etc. \n\n\nThis could be at 4:00 P.M. Wednesday the 3rd. or morning of the 5th\nFriday.\n\n\nThis is besides the Thursday Lit. input. \n\n \n\nWe are presuming Isagani arrives with you; and, will leave on the\n2:15 plane for Cebu on the 5th as indicated. \n\n\n5. All we need from this end is to send you the number of people\nattending the sessions.\n\n\n6. We have accommodations in the Brothers ' house.\n\n\nThe bathrooms are at the end of the corridors, so some may want to\nbring bathrobes.\n\n\nBring soap & toilet articles; we will provide the rest.\n\n\n7. There will be no grade school teachers at Tish 's and Isagani 's\ntalks on the 4th as requested.\n\n \n\nI think that covers everything.\n\n\nI will need a quick response on whether Isagani is willing to give\nthat extra presentation. \n\n \n\nHope your weekly \" monthly &rdquo; no-day group meetings\nare a success.\n\n\nThe next time I write it will be by computer.\n\n\nJudith Aldaba sent us a set of 40 used ones and we took two for the\ncommunity.\n\n\nAs usual Judith did a good job - - the machines \nwere cleaned and repaired before shipment and we have ready-to-use sets. \n\n \n\nBest regards to all. \n\n\nB. Benildo \n\n\n\n\nNov. 14, 1997\n\n\nDear Presy,\n\n \n\nThanks for your FAX note.\n\n\nThings are settling down as we go into the 2nd semester.\n\n\n PAISAA events at all levels are the distractions\nthis month.\n\n\nAfter that it will be the  Fiesta  on Dec. 8 and\nthen Christmas activities.\n\n\nWe plan to have an Advent liturgy on Monday Dec. 1. \n\n \n\nAn ex-freshman coed who dropped out last month to get a job in\nManila was raped and stabbed to  death this week.\n\n\nDetails a bit sketchy, but it seems a boyfriend drug addict didn't\nwant her to leave and he is now the prime suspect.\n\n\nThey are looking for him.\n\n\nIt happened at her house while the whole family was out. \n\n \n\nI will arrive in Manila on Dec. 19 ( Friday), same flight you\ntook.\n\n\nWill proceed to Greenhills so I can deliver the crabs & shrimps at my\nsister 's place.\n\n\nWill see you at South Gate DLSU 11:00 a. m. on the 20th ( as\nsuggested in your fax message). \n\n \n\nWe had to let  Johnny  the houseboy go; among others, we\nlost brand new towels - - remember we were talking about these.\n\n\nBest regards. \n\n\nB. Benildo \n\n\n\n\nSept. 18, 1997\n\n\nDear Shrimp and Crab Convert,\n\n \n\nThanks for your letter.\n\n\nThe newsletter was timely as we are drafting our written stand.\n\n\nNext week we are holding teach-in sessions on campus, a plebiscite,\nand on the 29th, a march through the city.\n\n\nThe 29th is the first day of congress in Manila.\n\n\nLooks like the other schools and Christian Churches are following - -\nif not us, the Bishop next door. \n\n \n\nI am afraid Ozamiz will be blamed for high-blood pressure cases\nin Manila.\n\n\nI have brought kilos of crabs and shrimps to my sister and she is\nmaking new friends and meeting long-lost relatives as a result.\n\n\nPeople claim our seafood tastes better than Manila 's fare.\n\n\nPlease note, as acting tour and travel guide, that our seafood is\nseasonal - - you may disappoint your clients.\n\n\nWe have the Beatrice and Asian Hotels, the latter good enough for Ina\nRaymundo and Donna Cruz. \n\n \n\nI gave a note to Loquias, the research director and Carmen says\nshe will follow-up for a reply.\n\n\nFollowing our last minute conversation, I did inform her not to\npublish anything until we hear from the four of you - - hence my note to\nPresy saying,  \" Please send text or summary or outline of your\npresentation.\n\n\nDr. Loquias needs those ( to be published). &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nI will have to send a researcher to Iligan to answer you re Maria\nCristina.\n\n\nBut I think the original falls we saw from the rooftop of the\noriginal power plant, was named after \" Maria Cristina \" , a\nSpanish Queen or Princess ( during the time of President Quirino). \n\n \n\nWistful thinking: In the beginning I kept talking about the\ntrimestral system and its pros and cons.\n\n\nNow I am finding out I am averaging only 14 weeks of class meetings a\nsemester here.\n\n\nThere are many interruptions - - college weeks, Church feasts,\norientation days, sports/intramurals,  etc. \n\n\nNo program is less than 3 hours long.\n\n\nIf liturgies work we will all be sanctified soon. \n\n \n\nWe are holding off on the internet.\n\n\nMisamis U. the rival took the first plunge and got some p. r. mileage\nout of it and now they are finding it too costly.\n\n\nI found an individual willing to rent lines by the hour and we may go\nthat way if I find only 5 or 6 professional users in the college.\n\n\nOur students are already subscribing to him; computers are in his\noffice and so you avoid the problem w/ modems and PLDT local lines. \n\n \n\nThis week the rains have come back w/ a vengeance.\n\n\nPhone lines down.\n\n\nThe grade school kids are enjoying p. e. \n- - w/ mud puddles an added attraction.\n\n\nNot to be outdone, the college held a 3-day intramurals activity.\n\n\nThere was a 5-hour program that included a beauty contest ( you would\nhave banned this at DLSU).\n\n\nI will not describe the attire as there was not much to describe.\n\n\nWe signalled the start of hostilities by singing St. Francis ' hymn\non Peace! \n\n \n\nFinally, this is  Lakas  country.\n\n\nThere is peace by Mindanao standards; no Muslim insurgency and no\nrefugees from troubled areas of the island.\n\n\nThat was not true under Cory or Marcos.\n\n\nSo there is soul searching among those reconciling their faith to and\nloyalty to country.\n\n\nMost here are civil servants.\n\n\nSay hello to all. \n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\nB. Benildo \n\n\n\n\nNov. 7, 1997\n\n\nDear Tish,\n\n \n\nThanks for the two books.\n\n\nI will give these back in December.\n\n\nThe other one you gave me Presy will return to you together w/ this\nletter.\n\n\nI struggled through and did not appreciate it until the last hundred\npages.\n\n\nI think it 's clever.\n\n\nBut I just about gave up and was ready to retreat to Chaucer and\ncompany - - if that book is what modern civilization is about. \n\n \n\nWe had a big crowd of PHILSCUF reps and offered them the usual:\n\n\nbrownouts for those who missed the Cory era;\n\n\nwalks from hotel to conference room in school;\n\n\na program and supper - - the speeches and dance number by faculty;\n\n\ncancelled flights - - they were not impressed by the boat ride from\nCebu. \n\n \n\nAll in all memories of Ozamiz they will have for a long time.\n\n\n \n\nGave your proposal to Carmen via her secretary.\n\n\nAnd also the journal article. \n\n \n\nI have finally convinced Lita Quebengco to come ( February?) and\ngive input on research.\n\n\nFrom what you know of her background and work and our situation\nhere, what do you suggest.\n\n\nWhat particular area on research should she concentrate on in her\npresentation.\n\n\nYour suggestions will be of much help - - this will be our first\nexperience w/ Lita. \n\n \n\nThe weather is clearing a bit so the crabs may arrive in Manila\nthis evening.\n\n\nThere are 18 PHILSCUF people praying all morning.\n\n\nThey don't want to miss their weekend in Manila.\n\n\nThanks for everything again.\n\n\nTill December. \n\n\nB. Benildo \n\n\n\n\nNov. 28, 1997\n\n\nDear Tish,\n\n \n\nI just finished replying to Virgie who received our MOA.\n\n\nThanks for your letter of the 15th.\n\n\nThe next time Virgie writes please add a second stamp from your\nschool mission fund so the message gets to us in less than 10 days. \n\n \n\nOur PAASCU visit has been put off 6 months ( now July 1998)\nbecause there are many schools and not enough accreditors, it seems.\n\n\nCarmen is withholding the news until after all reports are in.\n\n\nShe is glad for the extra time as there are unfinished cleanup and\nrepair work at physical facilities. \n\n \n\nBro. Greg tells me we made a mistake in ordering the crabs from\nTangub City.\n\n\nThe supplier billed at Manila prices ( &peso;270) when the local\nones, though smaller, cost only &peso;170 to &peso;180.\n\n\nThose are October pre-inflation prices. \n\n \n\n( A sideline: The Archbishop just called to tell me we can now\nhear the Church programs clearly ( and possibly w/ more volume); he spent\n&peso;80,000 for 4 new speakers, one facing our house, as preparations for\nthe Dec. 8  fiesta  go into high gear.)\n\n\nEarplugs may be considered Christmas items. \n\n \n\nMeanwhile, Iligan has their PAASCU visit today & yesterday.\n\n\nWhen the team arrived, Thursday was suddenly declared a Muslim\nholiday, but Bro. Jimmy kept the high school students in. \n\n \n\nI informed Carmen about cancellation of plans for seminar.\n\n\nI think one difficulty is they tend to make all teachers attend\nseminars and fail to invite those from other schools.\n\n\nSo unless they cancel all other activities, seminars are not held.\n\n\n \n\nWill invite Lita using your input.\n\n\nI hope something can be worked out. \n\n \n\nPlease forward this note to Jo Bago.\n\n\nI think she was w/ us here at PHILSCUF ( now PHILCUA). \n\n \n\nFinished your first book ( excellent light reading) and am\nenjoying the second one - - plots galore, Saddam Hussein the expected\nvillain, politics at the White House and Tom Clancy 's  critique\n of the U. S. Constitution and liberal Supreme Court cleverly\ndisguised as character opinions. \n\n \n\nFinally, as a celibate who has to teach religion to college\nseniors, my advice on matrimony is: have a dress rehearsal the day before,\nvideotape and cameras and all, a supper for a small group of 30, and then\nelope.\n\n\nThe money saved by not entertaining 200 guests could be given to the\nChurch or your  Alma Mater  .\n\n\nSo far no one has followed my advice. \n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\nBro. Benildo \n\n\n\n\nNovember 28, 1997\n\n\nDear Virgie,\n\n \n\nPlease note the letterhead.\n\n\nThis indicates I have finally cleaned out the old boxes from the old\ndays.\n\n\nReceived your letter today re the MOA.\n\n\nThanks for the suggestions and especially on part 2, though we have\nnot entered into negotiations with the Chamber.\n\n\nWe are giving them the draft as our proposal for a general\nagreement.\n\n\nReason: it is the only way we can deal with individual businesses\nlater.\n\n\nAre you saying we should now propose doing part 2 for them, as basic\nto any further research on individual companies? \n\n \n\nYes, I have changed the luncheon date to the 22nd December as\nyou suggested.\n\n\nMay I know where this will be as I am coming from Greenhills on that\nday.\n\n\nThe 23rd is not a free day for me. \n\n \n\nThanks for conducting a towel investigation.\n\n\nThis is now on the national level.\n\n\nActually, if you and Presy had not come a second time, we would\nnever have known.\n\n\nIt 's a typical religious house classic: one thought that the other\ntwo got extra towels for their own use,  etc  .\n\n\nAfter you left the second time we had a search for clean towels as\nthere were visitors arriving the following day.\n\n\nAfter the usual exchange of  \" I thought you took them.\n&rdquo;  , everything fell into place.\n\n\nOccasionally I find out I am missing something from my desk drawer,\nclosets,  etc.  \n\n \n\nWe are installing metal detectors before your next visit. \n\n \n\n El Ni&ntilde;o  has been kind to us.\n\n\nWe have clear days to dry the laundry and rains in the evening and\nsometimes early morning.\n\n\nI have 66 and 68 in my two senior Christian morality classes.\n\n\nAt this time of the year, absences due to cholera, chicken pox and\ndiarrhea are common - - whole boarding houses w/ poor water supply. \n\n \n\nRegion X CHED sent us the princely sum of &peso;86,000 and a\nmust-do-by Dec. 31 letter for our connection to Internet.\n\n\nSo next time you can save on &peso;4 stamps!\n\n\nI do better by waiting for travellers passing through.\n\n\nThis letter will be carried by Bro. Jude Reyes who is going to\nThailand on Dec. 9. \n\n\nBest regards.\n\n\nSherlock Holmes", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "80847e5a-bb9d-49bc-b619-b6ca3ec9fb30", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.142679+00:00"}

Cook, we passed several farms\nagain...  \" and on these farms, we found some sheep,\neyay-eyay-o! &rdquo;  .\n\n\nSeriously,  sobrang dami talagang sheep! \n\n\nThey would dot the landscape and at one point, Mike said: \n \" Para silang parasites, ano? &rdquo;  \n\n\nThey were just there grazing, heads bowed to reach the grass or hay,\neven if it had snow or frost.\n\n\nI also saw some brown cattle, and then some black cattle.\n\n\n Sabi ko, first time kong makakita ng black na cattle.\n\n\n\nMike deadpans:   \" dyan galing ang black angus\".\n \n\n\nSince it was close to winter,  syempre  , darkness\nfell early.\n\n\nAnd boy, the roads were very dark,  talaga  ,\nspecially since the farmhouses were miles and miles away from each other.\n\n\nAnd the roads were two lanes  lang  ,  tapos\n you have the lake or a farm on either side of the road.\n\n\n Mahusay ang kanilang mga drivers.  \n\n \n\nQueenstown is a small town with a tiny population which triples\nduring winter because it has NZ 's premier ski resorts.\n\n\nOur hotel was Copthorne Lakefront Resort Hotel, and the view from the\nrestaurant was fantastic!\n\n\nPlus, it was walking distance  lang  from the town\nproper, called \" \" The Town Center &rdquo; \" .\n\n\nHere you 'll find all kinds of restaurants, and a few shops.\n\n\nAfter checking in, we walked to the town, looking for a seafood\nrestaurant.\n\n\nAlas, the one recommended by the hotel was closed for renovation!\n\n\nSo we ended up having dinner at Lone Star, after reviewing its menu\nwhich was placed outside the restaurant, plus  sobrang lamig na\n and I wanted to enter any building  na  !\n\n\nWe shared the pumpkin soup and salad, and then I had one dozen NZ\nmussels while Mike had venison steak.\n\n\nIt was lovely because we were seated quite close to the fireplace,\nand the food was wonderful!\n\n\nFrom there, we walked back to the hotel.\n\n\nIt was an uphill climb back and with the cold and the thin air,\n hiningal kami ni Mike  . \n\n \n\nThe following day, we had the buffet breakfast in the hotel, and\nthen we were on our way to Milford Sound.\n\n\nAgain, it was a long way off so we had to take a teabreak again\nmidway.\n\n\nWe went to Te Anau, which is a farming village.\n\n\nWe saw the town proper also, and it was like being transported back\nto \" Little House on the Prairie \" , with the small shops\nand farms, farms, farms! \n\n \n\nFrom there, we also made several stops for  Kodakan\n .\n\n\nAgain, the views were breathtaking, and since the bus had a glass\nceiling, all around  talaga maganda yung view  .\n\n\nWe had a scenic cruise on Milford Sound, and again, we were\nsurrounded by snow-capped mountains, and we would see waterfalls here and\nthere.\n\n\nWe had lunch on the boat, and after lunch and complimentary coffee\nand tea, we spent much of our time on the top deck just taking it all in.\n\n\nOf course I kept thanking God for all my blessings, specially for\nhaving been given the opportunity to see His magnificent creation, and how I\nwanted for Mamey to see this masterpiece!\n\n\nThe weather was wonderful ( it was raining the previous week) so we\nfelt doubly blessed.\n\n\nIt was just so peaceful out there, on the boat, looking at the\nscenery, even if again it was a little cold because of the light breeze.\n\n\nThen in this wonderful setting, Mike goes,   \"\nKaya pala talagang namatay si Jack sa Titanic, ano?\n\n\nAng lamig siguro ng tubig! &rdquo;  Nyek! \n\n\nTalk about destroying the moment.\n\n\n Tawa kami ng tawa!  \n\n \n\nFrom there, we drove back to Queenstown, passing by Te Anau again\nand stopping for a bit longer so people could have a light snack and also to\nlook around the shops.\n\n\nMike and I just had ice cream there, and as usual, I bought my fridge\nmagnet in the souvenir shop. \n\n \n\nBack at Queenstown, I was dying to have soup and rice, so we went\nto a Chinese restaurant.\n\n\nWe had lots of food, and the taste was quite good  naman\n .\n\n\n Hindi siya  Europeanized or Americanized Chinese, so\nhappy  naman kami. \n\n\nWe saw a McCafe in the center too, so of course we had to try that.\n\n\nWe then walked back to the hotel. \n\n \n\nScheduled for Thursday was a half-day city tour.\n\n\nWe found out that we were the only ones taking that tour so \nna-solo namin yung  tour guide and car.\n\n\n Nagka-official photographer tuloy kami! \n\n\nWe first went to the A. J. Hackett bridge where  bungee\n jumping was born.\n\n\nUnfortunately, we got there five minutes too late!\n\n\nWe missed somebody who  bungee  jumped!\n\n\nIt 's really a little crazy to be  bungee  jumping\nin that kind of a weather, but I guess they 're really crazy.\n\n\nOur guide said that a couple even exchanged marriage vows on the\nbridge, and  bungee  jumped right after.\n\n\nWhat happens is after you jump, you are lowered on to a raft on the\nriver below, and then you walk up the stairs back to the bridge.\n\n\nAnd the fee is not exactly cheap.\n\n\nThrough all the years, only one minor accident has been recorded.\n\n\n \n\nThen we went to the first vineyard the South Island had.\n\n\nIt had a really nice shop and of course, it had wine tasting.\n\n\nThat would have been free had we taken the \" wine cave tour\n&rdquo; but we opted not to do so ( I saw that  na kasi  at\nthe Napa Valley.\n\n\n Naks  ! ) .\n\n\nSo we paid for the wine tasting  na lang  .\n\n\nThat 's Mike 's frustration with me  kasi  I don't\ntake wine.\n\n\nSo he 's still trying to convince me to take it up.\n\n\nAfter that, we went to Arrowtown, a place which had a gold rush in\nthe early 20th century.\n\n\nWe went to the museum, and on one part of the museum, there was a\ntimeline which traced important events, not only in New Zealand, but in the\nworld.\n\n\nOf course, not all years were represented, but would you believe that\nit had  \" 1986: Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos was ousted\nfrom power &rdquo;  .?\n\n\n Sobra kaming nagulat ni Mike! \n\n\nIf we thought the other villages we went to were quaint, this was\neven more so.\n\n\nIt had a population of 1,800 people.\n\n\n Mas maraming tao pa sa Marcelo or Merville! \n\n\nAnd guess what?\n\n\nIt had a golf course!\n\n\n Sobrang malumanay ang mga tao  . They would greet you\nwarmly every time you entered a shop.\n\n\nI bought some door stoppers in this Pottery Shop, for Tagaytay.\n\n\nAgain, the day was cold as the temp was - 4 degrees. \n\n \n\nThen we went back to the hotel,  mga 2 p.m. na yun\n , and we decided to just order room service because it was too cold.\n\n\nLate in the afternoon, we went back to The Town Center so we could\ntake the  gondola  (  parang  cable car)\nwhich would take us to the top of the mountain.\n\n\nAs usual,  ang ganda na naman nung view  .\n\n\nWe decided to do it at this time  para  we could see\nQueenstown during the day, and then at night on our way down.\n\n\nWhen we got there, we went to the observation deck, and it snowed!!!\n\n\nGod is so good  talaga  !\n\n\nImagine, we didn't expect that but it happened!\n\n\nWe just walked around and watched a short video about New Zealand.\n\n\nThen we took the  gondola  back to The Town\nCenter.\n\n\nIt was our last night in Queenstown so we just kept on walking and\nwalking, until we reached their Boardwalk-  parang  a row of\nrestaurants beside the casino and the lake.\n\n\nWe decided on this restaurant which had lots of awards mounted on\ntheir walls, plus it had oysters,  at medyo fine dining pa  .\n\n\nMike had clam chowder soup (  ang sarap-sarap  ) while\nI had the half-dozen oysters.\n\n\nMy main course was lobster and Mike 's was this delicious fish.\n\n\n( I can't remember  na kung  kingfish, codfish, or\nwhatever  kasi ang dami naming pinagpilian  from the menu,\n eh  ! )\n\n\nAs usual, I was so corny and had a Diet Coke with it, not wine.\n\n\nSuch a lovely dinner that one.\n\n\nThen it was back to the hotel to pack our clothes for our trip to\nAuckland the next day. \n\n \n\nWe were picked up at 10 a.m. the next day so we had a leisurely\nbreakfast, and we made sure we sat where the view of the mountains was best.\n\n\nAgain, God is so good  talaga  !\n\n\nBy the way, our timing  pala  was excellent.\n\n\nWe left Queenstown on Friday, and the ski season was going to start\nthat Saturday!\n\n\nAnd because of the huge amount of snow which has fallen on the\nmountains already, arrivals were up 50% versus prior year.\n\n\nSo  eksakto yung pag-alis namin  ( not to mention our\nrates). \n\n \n\nQueenstown 's airport was tiny, but the location was superb!\n\n\nWhen our flight was called, we walked out of the terminal, towards\nthe plane, and again, the view was breathtaking.\n\n\n Sayang nga  I didn't have a picture there.\n\n\nBut Mike and I fell in love with the South Island.\n\n\n Atche  , this is a must see for you!\n\n\nKuPet 's been there and he agrees that the scenery is glorious!\n\n\nGetting there is a little expensive, but operating expenses are so\nmuch less than in Europe. \n\n \n\nI 'll have to end this here.\n\n\nNew Zealand Part 3 will be about Auckland.  \n\n\n\n\nFrom: Gina Navarette RBN, MKTG rbn@jollibee.com.ph\n\n\nSent: Thursday, June 14, 2001 3:37 PM\n\n\nTo: 'fbautista@yahoogroups.com'; 'tessiebc@pacific.net.ph'\n\n\nSubject: New Zealand Part 2\n\n\n13 June 2001\n\n\n11:01 a. m. ( continued today, 14 June, 8:03 a. m.)\n\n \n\nOur flight to Auckland from Queenstown was right on sked.\n\n\nLanding in Auckland, we knew already that we were in the city.\n\n\nNot just that the airport was so much bigger, but there were just so\nmany people!\n\n\nIt 's not like landing in LA or SF, but coming from the serene South\nIslands, this was a little jolting. \n\n \n\nThe shuttle was right outside waiting for us and we were brought\nstraight to our hotel, the Sky City Casino Hotel.\n\n\nAuckland is your regular big city - - traffic lights in every street\ncorner, a road construction, tall buildings, lots of people walking, shops\nand shops and shops.\n\n\nAuckland has a population of 1.3M, so that 's more than a third of\nNZ 's total population.\n\n\nThe mix was very interesting: lots of Caucasians of course, but\nthere were so many Orientals.\n\n\nAnd they weren't tourists. \n\n \n\nAfter settling in and checking out the maps, we walked to the\nCatholic Church to find out their mass sked for the following day, Saturday.\n\n\nSince Sunday was our travelling day, we wanted to make sure that we\nwould be able to hear the anticipated mass on Saturday.\n\n\n Nyek  , there were no anticipated masses in\nAuckland!\n\n\nSo we decided to hear mass early Saturday morning  na lang\n .\n\n\nAfter doing that, we walked around again and looked for a place for\nlunch.\n\n\nThe work bug caught up with us as we saw a McDonald 's store with a\nnew burger that they launched.\n\n\nSo, we had to try out that product.\n\n\nOkay  naman  - true to McDo fashion, bland, but the\ndressing was good.\n\n\nFrom there, we walked to the Imax theatre.\n\n\nNeither one of us has watched an Imax movie so this was quite a\ntreat.\n\n\nEvery screening was a new movie so we decided on Cyberworld, the\nfirst 3D animated movie ( the others were on Michael Jordan and some other\nold stuff).\n\n\nWhile waiting for the movie, we passed the time away in a Barnes &\nNoble bookstore, again a throwback to our New Jersey days when we 'd spend so\nmuch time in B&N!\n\n\nBooks are really so much cheaper here in Manila, thank God for that.\n\n\nSo we just read and read.\n\n\nThe movie was cool!\n\n\nActually, it 's the 3D glasses and the Imax effects which were cool.\n\n\n Ang galing pala nun! \n\n\nPlus of course the screen was so huge!\n\n\nWe kept on saying how much the kids would have enjoyed that\nexperience.\n\n\nFrom there, we walked around again, tried to shop but alas, found\nnothing.\n\n\nMy travel agent was right: there 's nothing to buy in NZ.\n\n\nFinally, we saw some name brands and they obviously catered to the\nJapanese: Louis Vitton, Ferragamo,  etc. \n\n\nNone of the mainstream brands like Nine West, Gap, Bass, \netc. \n\n\nWe decided to walk back to the hotel and go to the casino. \n\n \n\nWe told ourselves we 'd spend &dollar;10 each on the slot\nmachines-and that 's 10 NZ dollars, not US!\n\n\n( That 's around &peso;220 each!)\n\n\n Eh  , while we were on our way to the casino, a guy\ngave us a &dollar;5 coupon which can be redeemed if we spend at least\n&dollar;5 inside the casino.\n\n\n Tapos  , they had a scratch card promo  pa\n where they 'd give you a card as you enter the casino.\n\n\nWe got our cards and each of us won &dollar;5!\n\n\nSo we redeemed the &dollar;5 from the card, and then got the\n&dollar;5 from the coupon.\n\n\nSo, our &dollar;10 was free for each of us!\n\n\n Babaw, ano? \n\n\nSo we went to the 10-cent slot machines and our money lasted for a\nlittle over an hour.\n\n\nThen we had a late dinner in the Chinese restaurant in the hotel.\n\n\nWe had hot and sour soup, mixed vegetables and pigeon.\n\n\nAgain,  masarap sya  and quite reasonable even if it\nwas in the hotel  na  . \n\n \n\nThe following day was free.\n\n\nWe didn't ask the travel agency to book any tours for us as we\ndecided to do it ourselves  na lang  .\n\n\nWe had our buffet breakfast in the coffee shop, then we walked to\nSt. Patrick 's Cathedral ( wow,  kala mo  New York!) for the 8\na.m. mass.\n\n\nAs expected, there were lots of  Pinoys  in the\ncongregation, and it was a Saturday morning mass!\n\n\nI 'm sure  mas marami pa kung Sunday  .\n\n\nThe church was quite simple in design, but you would feel very much\nat peace there, specially since it was in the middle of the city and the\nbusiness district, at that.\n\n\nFrom there, we tried walking to a terminal where we could catch the\nHop on-hop off bus for the city tour, but it suddenly rained hard so we took\na cab  na lang  to the first stop we wanted to go to: Kelly\nTarlston 's.\n\n\nThis is like an educational Antarctica attraction.\n\n\nIt talks about life in Antarctica, the conditions there, and most\nspecially the animal life there.\n\n\nWe saw real penguins and real snow, and you take this short ride so\nyou can come close to the penguins.\n\n\nIt also has a huge aquarium, similar to that in Sentosa but pales in\ncomparison to Ocean Park, with a walkalator so you can see all the sealife.\n\n\nOf course at the end,  ang walang kamatayang \nsouvenir shop.\n\n\nI found this place not too value-for-money, and yet it 's the\n#1 attraction in Auckland! \n\n \n\nFrom there we took the city bus and went to the Auckland Museum.\n\n\nNow this one was a real treat!\n\n\nIt has three floors and a lot of it was devoted to their \nMaori  heritage.\n\n\nMost interesting to me though was the section on the wars.\n\n\nThey made it so poignant because the displays showed quotes from\nletters of either the people who served in the wars, or their relatives who\nkept on waiting and praying for them to come back.\n\n\nIt even had a section which asked people, if they served in the war,\nto write down their names, battalion numbers ( or whatever), where they\nserved,  etc.  , and these notes were displayed too.\n\n\n Nakakakilabot  because I read some notes which said\nthey were POWs or escapees, how long they were imprisoned,  etc.\n\n\n\nIt really made me thank God that I have not lived through a war, and\nI prayed intently that none of us would ever have to go through that.\n\n\nIt was also very touching because NZ really offered its armed forces\nas a peacekeeping force, and offered its women as part of the medical\ncontingent.\n\n\n Kumbaga  , they could have stayed in the background\nbut didn't.\n\n\nThey also devoted several walls with the names of the New Zealanders\nwho fought and died engraved on the walls.\n\n\nIt was touching how some names had tiny red flowers beside them, to\nsignify that they have not been forgotten.\n\n\nMuch smaller, but no less poignant, was the section on the\nHolocaust.\n\n\nDefinitely, it was not as heartbreaking as The Holocaust Museum in\nWashington DC, but it was not possible not to feel anger yet again for\nHitler.\n\n\nIt had audiotapes of interviews with the survivors, and of course\nlots of pictures and mementos. \n\n \n\nI thought we 'd stay there for only an hour, but we were there\nfor almost three hours.\n\n\nIt was truly worth going to.\n\n\nWhile waiting for the bus on the steps of the museum, we had another\ntreat ( or trick?).\n\n\nA group of Indians suddenly set up what looked like a tripod on a\nclear, cemented space fronting the museum, and we thought it was your usual\ntour group posing for a picture.\n\n\nAnd then, somebody turned on a tape, and Indian music came on.\n\n\nThen one of the teen girls, suddenly started dancing!\n\n\n Yun bang  dance that we see in the Indian MTV\nchannel on cable.\n\n\nI 'm sure all of you are quite familiar with how they dance, with\ntheir jerky moves, and the music they dance to!\n\n\n Tawa kami ng tawa ni Mike. \n\n\n Sabi namin  ,  now we 've seen everything!\n\n\n\nAnd then it rained again.\n\n\n Hala, sige pa rin ang sayaw!  \n\n \n\nWe then had a very late lunch in the city again, and then we\njust kept on walking and walking around again.\n\n\nWe chanced upon this shop selling stuff for the house so I bought a\nfew things for Tagaytay-  lalagyan ng  sugar and cream,\ncondiments, that sort of stuff.\n\n\nIt was 4 p.m., and then the shops started closing  na\n !\n\n\nBad trip!\n\n\n Buti na lang  one bookstore continued to be open so\nwe looked around some more.\n\n\nThen, after deciding that there was nothing else to do, we went back\nto the hotel and caught Game 6 of the Sixers-Bucks game live.\n\n\nAfter that, went up the Sky City Tower, which is the highest\nstructure in NZ.\n\n\nIt 's higher than the Eiffel Tower and a bunch of other tall\nbuildings in the world.\n\n\nNeedless to say, the view from up there was quite impressive also.\n\n\nOf course not as breathtaking as the view in the South Island,\n pero maganda na rin. \n\n\nWe stayed there a long time, just walking around in the observation\ndeck.\n\n\nWe had wanted to eat in the revolving restaurant but reservations\nhad to be done weeks in advance  pala  !\n\n\nAs in Queenstown, we chose to go up before dusk so we could see\nAuckland with and without lights.\n\n\nIt was our last night, so of course, we thanked God again for\nkeeping us safe and warm throughout our vacation, and also for taking good\ncare of the kids ( who actually had the time of their lives too, having slept\nover in a friend 's house, and having their best friends from Southbay sleep\nin our house!).\n\n\nWe then walked out into the city again and had dinner. \n\n \n\nWe went back to the hotel to pack our stuff.\n\n\nThe shuttle fetched us at 4:15 a.m. the next day for our trip back\nhome.\n\n\nThis time, we had only two legs: first to Sydney, and then a\nnon-stop Sydney-Mla.\n\n\nWe had a 3-hour layover in Sydney so we just went around\nwindowshopping.\n\n\nNothing to buy really, except a  mahjong  set.\n\n\nThis is really for Mamey in Tagaytay because she doesn't want to\nplay  mahjong  in the clubhouse, but in our house.\n\n\nIt 's a little smaller than the usual  pero may \nnumbers, so Mamey should be fine.\n\n\nOur flights were uneventful, and when we landed in Manila, Jaime and\nthe kids were there.\n\n\nAnd of course, our first meal was in Jollibee.\n\n\nYummy  ang  Chickenjoy and Fish n Rice! \n\n \n\nThanks to everyone for their prayers.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c968aa62-0cc0-4cb6-b98e-a0de9bf62bdf", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.143992+00:00"}

we\nstarted at 9 AM and ended at 8 PM.\n\n\nIn fact our formal dinner was canceled as all the head office people\njust wanted to go home and they obviously weren't in the mood for social\namenities, which was fine with me.\n\n\nI had dinner with some of the Filipino colleagues from Kraft and we\nhad a terrific steak dinner.\n\n\nI know, I know, but steak is one of my comfort foods.\n\n\nI had an 18 ounce T-bone, seared on the outside but medium rare\ninside, excellent! \n\n \n\nOn Thursday morning I learned that the airports were still closed\nand worse, my flight back on Friday was also canceled.\n\n\nI called up Joji in Manila for her to get me on any flight out of NY\nas it was really a hot spot.\n\n\nAnyway I still had my meeting and dinner with Ray Rogan, our\ndistributor in New York, who picked me up around noon, and we drove to New\nJersey where we had our meeting.\n\n\nLater I finally met Lani, his daughter, and her fianc\u00e9, Carl\nWilson, a Brit.\n\n\nCarl is okay and they will make a good couple.\n\n\nAfterwards we went to the \" Manor \" , a nice Country\nClub where the reception is going to be held exactly a week from Saturday.\n\n\nThey wanted to show me what I was going to miss, and we took a few\npictures, and had a great seafood meal.\n\n\nTowards the end I offered a toast, I gave some words of advice and\nthe night was over.\n\n\nThe Rogans send their love and regards to the whole family.\n\n\nIn my mind throughout the dinner, however, and unbeknownst to them,\nwas how the hell I was going to go home. \n\n \n\nOn Friday morning, after three difficult hours of connecting with\nthe airlines and going through all sorts of routing ( going to Canada, where\nthere were 6 hour waits at the border, and then catching a flight from\nMontreal) and still coming up blank, including a notice from JAL ( my\noriginal booking) that the earliest they could confirm a flight back to\nManila was on September 20(!), Joji called to say that I was confirmed on PAL\n( which, incidentally I am forbidden to ride, for safety reasons) on Sept. 18\n( Tuesday) from LAX.\n\n\nNow the problem was how to get to LA.\n\n\nLuckily I learned that my boss was going to drive to Minneapolis ( a\n21-hour drive) via Chicago ( a 14-hour drive) and so I offered to go with\nhim, figuring that I would have an easier time catching a flight out of\nChicago other than NY.\n\n\nSo on Friday afternoon at 2 PM we set out on a Hertz rental car,\ndrove for 7 hours, slept over in a clean and comfy Holiday Inn in Du Bois,\nPennsylvania, where I had a glimpse of middle America during breakfast ( lots\nof pot bellied people wearing baseball caps), started again at 7:30 AM and\ngot to Chicago at 3 PM.\n\n\nAlong the way I made reservations at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago and\nthat is where my boss dropped me off. \n\n \n\nYou know, the driving trip was actually not bad.\n\n\nCruise control is a terrific invention but while technology has made\nthings easier, the strain on the back, the pinch and fatigue on the butt\nstill felt the same.\n\n\nOn the other hand, it was food for the soul - we drove through some\nnice countryside in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana, places I had never been\nbefore.\n\n\nI really felt good seeing the sign  Pennsylvania welcomes you\n , and sort of leaving the bad memories of New York behind.\n\n\n14 hours of driving made me realize just how big North America is,\nand telling myself never, ever to take flying for granted because it is truly\na time and lifesaver.\n\n\nChicago of course has been a long time favorite of mine, and upon\nseeing the skyline, with the Sears tower on the horizon I felt a renewed\nspirit, a cautious optimism that things were still going to be all right.\n\n\n \n\nFreshly situated at the Hyatt, with a river view in the hotel on\nSaturday afternoon, I let my fingers do the walking but unfortunately came up\nzero with the big airlines that offered direct flights.\n\n\nI then tried the small regional airlines and finally struck gold with\nSouthwest who had available seats, but sorry, no first or business classes.\n\n\nI then called up Nora, my  balae  , and she and Jet\npicked me up around 6 PM and brought me to a baby shower for one of Nora 's\nnieces.\n\n\nAt last I had Filipino food, and most important, they had rice.\n\n\nA few of those who attended Tricia 's wedding were also there but\nforgive me as I have forgotten their names.\n\n\nJoe and Marty, Jude 's uncle and aunt were there, as well as the\n Lola  of Jude.\n\n\nThey were asking me to stay longer so we could play golf but I told\nthem no, my first priority was to get to LA.\n\n\nTricia, your mother in law is looking well. \n\n \n\nI woke up at 5 AM and took a cab to the airport.\n\n\nIncidentally when I checked in they opened my luggage right there on\nthe check-out counter, and the counter lady just put on plastic gloves and\nboom, she went through each inch of my luggage.\n\n\nTwo more passport checks and finally I was on the plane.\n\n\nSo yesterday there I was, first on a flight to Las Vegas, in coach\nlike all the rest of the world and not really caring that I was in the back\nof the plane.\n\n\nAnd as I watched the clouds underneath go by, and seated beside a\ngentleman with a cane who claimed he is going to a poetry convention in Las\nVegas because he is a writer and a poet and who has written two books and is\nwell on finishing his third, and because of his knurled fingers kept asking\nme to open the small food packs given by the airline, I knew that nearly all\nwas well with me.\n\n\nAnd despite all the anxieties of the last week, I am content in the\nknowledge that finally I am on my way home to my family whom I miss very much\nand yes, God loves me. \n\n \n\nFrom Las Vegas I connected on a short hop to LAX.\n\n\nWhile waiting I had a small  pepperoni pizza  and\nlost &dollar;5 dollars at the slot machines.\n\n\nI landed in LA and saw that they were only allowing tour buses,\nshuttles and taxis into the airport.\n\n\nPrivate vehicles go to a terminal outside the airport and the people\nare bused in, which is such a hassle.\n\n\nWhen I got to  Tita  Puput 's house nothing stirred\ninside - no wonder I always got Jiffy 's voice mail whenever I called.\n\n\nAnyway I called up  Tito  Vic ( using the taxi driver 's\ncell phone) and he told me that the Galvezes had gone to Las Vegas because\nJiffy had a gig!\n\n\nIn fact as I learned later on, as I was taking off they were starting\nto drive back to Pasadena.\n\n\nAnyway I found a Comfort Inn and checked in, and here I am finishing\nthis before I check-out and move to  Tita  Puput 's house.\n\n\nLast night, after mass, we had a nice Chinese dinner to celebrate\n Tita  Puput 's birthday.\n\n\nAfter dinner I watched Band of Brothers on HBO, which is excellent.\n\n\n Lola  is having a nice time - she watches all her\nfavorite TV shows, played  mahjong  once and won\n&dollar;10 and today she will be attending a seminar at  Tita \nPuput 's parish.\n\n\nShe is one happy camper.\n\n\nI heard she has also cooked  sinigang  for the\nGalvezes. \n\n \n\nLoves, I will be home soon.\n\n\nI really can't wait to see you and Mama. \n\n\nPapa  <subtext 2>\n\n\n\n \n\nHi to everyone. \n\n\nTo  ATE  ADJ,\n\n \n\nYesterday while Rica and I waited for the moviegoers I checked\nthe state of repair of Mommy 's leaking pipe and saw an old dollhouse\nstanding in the mud.\n\n\nI asked the maid to wash it to see if it still could be used and she\nsaid there were other parts on the other side of the house.\n\n\nIt was Ana 's dollhouse and I asked permission from Mommy if Rica\ncould have it.\n\n\nOf course, she said yes and from the clump of banana trees out came\n2/3 of the dollhouse.\n\n\nThree units  pala siya, ang laki-laki  !\n\n\nA few cracks here and there but was still usable. \n\n \n\nWhen we got home from dinner with Mommy and  Ate \nTish, the boys and Rica kept going around the house and didn't want to sleep.\n\n\nThey wanted to start furnishing the dollhouse immediately!\n\n\nSuper-excited  sila  and of course I am happy since\nthe boys will be distracted from the playstation and do some creative\nconstruction instead.\n\n\n Pero  Tato was the happiest, he goes  \"\nThe best thing is that it 's for free! &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nAlso , Rica was sporting the pair of shoes you gave her during\nthe houseblessing.\n\n\nShe likes it so much and was showing it off to her  lola\n . \n\n \n\nSo,  maraming salamat  and please send our thanks\nto  Ate  Ana as well.\n\n\n Magkakamukha na ang mga girls mo sa pictures  .\n\n\nWe miss you also. \n\n \n\nSee you guys on Thursday. \n\n\nJoville", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "3c3cf145-cb68-45e8-9549-b042fcc3791a", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.145879+00:00"}

I 've taken up running every other night.\n\n\nI quit smoking as well.   \n\n\n\n\nOctober 19, 1996\n\n\nDear friend,\n\n \n\nI 'm sorry this is a much-delayed letter.\n\n\nOne doesn't get too much leisure time over here.\n\n\nBesides work, I am also housekeeper, cook, chauffeur,  etc.\n\n\n\nOne luxury I miss here is having househelp.\n\n\n Dito pagdating galing sa trabaho, magluluto pa. \n\n\nOn weekends, I drive my son to all kinds of activities.\n\n\n Sa Amerika, pag may teenager, driver ang labas ng magulang.\n\n\n\nUnlike our kids there where there isn't much to do beyond going to\nthe movies and to shopping malls, children here are offered all kinds of\nactivities - - sports and academic - - free or at a minimal fee.\n\n\nSummer camp  lang ang mahal. \n\n\nDuring summer, there are all kinds of summer sports - - tennis,\nswimming, golf, baseball, summer camp,  etc. \n\n\n Tuliro ang magulang sa paghatid sundo. \n\n\nThis fall, instead of tennis, my son is into football so after work,\n sundo 'yan  because there are weekly interschool games on top\nof daily practice after school.\n\n\nOn Saturday morning, he goes to a college for a Marie Curie Science\nand Math program offered to above-average kids and funded by the federal\ngovernment.\n\n\nEighth graders, who are in the honors class, are assigned to advanced\nclasses that give them high school credit.\n\n\nDuring the course of the year, all students are given national\nstandardized tests in reading, writing, math, and science.\n\n\nI 've been in the U.S. five years, and I still am overwhelmed by the\nmany opportunities that children, if only they had parents like me, could\navail of.\n\n\nBut what touches me most every time I see it is this: all cars on the\nroad stop when a school bus waits for a child to get on and off the bus.\n\n\nBoth directions  yan, tigil lahat ng sasakyan. \n\n\n Sabi ko parang royalty ang mga batang ito. \n\n\nAnd yet there are a lot of messed up kids in America.\n\n\nAll these opportunities, free quality education, free books, free\ntransportation to and from school, all the sport and academic extracurricular\nofferings.\n\n\n Sabi ko kung dito ako ipinanganak, lahat siguro ng inalok sa\nakin, kinuha ko. \n\n\nOne drawback: college education is expensive.\n\n\nThe average annual cost to educate a child is &dollar;20,000. \n\n \n\nSo this is America.\n\n\nRight now, we are in the middle of fall.\n\n\nThis week is the height of the season.\n\n\n Diyos kong ganda ng paligid. \n\n\nI was telling a colleague yesterday that I still haven't gotten used\nto the gorgeous scenery in October; the foliage all around is in glorious\ncolors - - flaming orange, yellow, red - - awesome and breathtaking.\n\n\nSometimes, while driving to work, I pull over and just stare and\nmarvel at such glorious beauty.\n\n\n Kaya maraming artists sa Europe and Amerika. \n\n\nThe day after a snowfall is also pretty - - everything is enveloped\nin white, until the snow turns into slush and ice.\n\n\nThen we hate the snow.\n\n\nI personally dread winter because last winter, I got stuck in the\nmiddle of a hilly road.\n\n\nThe tires of my car couldn't get any traction, so the car just\nwouldn't budge.\n\n\nI go out and stood there hoping for an angel to come.\n\n\nThis angel came - - a stranger pulled over, asked me if I needed\nhelp, got into the driver seat, and got my car out of that icy spot.\n\n\nWhen he thought I had regained my composure, he told me to get into\nmy car and asked me to follow him.\n\n\nI 'll never forget that man.\n\n\nHe kept on driving to where I had told him I was bound for.\n\n\nHe turned back only when I signalled to him that I would be all right\nfrom there on.\n\n\nAll he got was a wave and a thank you.\n\n\nI didn't even have the chance to get his name and address. \n\n \n\nAmerica is a country of contradictions.\n\n\nHere people will either go out of their way to do a kind act or to do\nanother harm.\n\n\n Minsan  , late in the evening on the subway in New\nYork City, a black man protected me from a crazy homeless person, also black.\n\n\nWhen I thanked him, all he said was,  \" No problem.\n\n\nWe have to look out for one another, you know. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nI love this country.\n\n\nIf only Americans would realize their blessings. \n\n \n\nI 'm doing fine, careerwise.\n\n\nI am very thankful to Mr. Sibal.\n\n\nWhat I have become and what I am as an editor here, I feel I owe to\nthe confidence that Mr. Sibal had shown me while I was working for him.\n\n\nMy bosses and colleagues at work respect my capabilities.\n\n\nThey say I am good.\n\n\nPerhaps I am - - because of training and experience that I got while\nI was at \" Phoenix \" .\n\n\nFunny, my title is editor, but I actually don't develop manuscripts\n( development editors do that).\n\n\nI do proposals, analyze the market and teachers ' reviews of our\nbooks, recommend what manuscripts are worth making a proposal on, do sales\nprojections, work on plant costs, oversee the progress of every job assigned\nto me ( I do series, rather than individual titles), discuss projects with\nauthors - - in other words, I am a heartbeat away from becoming a publisher.\n\n\nIf only I wasn't a foreigner.\n\n\nMaybe if I finish my doctoral degree, I 'll become a publisher.\n\n\nI 've been planning to enroll at Columbia University, but I am still\nlazy.\n\n\nMaybe this summer. \n\n \n\nSo how 's everybody?\n\n\nI miss the university.\n\n\nI miss my friends there.\n\n\nWhether I 'd like to go back there again?\n\n\nI don't know.\n\n\nJobs aren't secure here, especially in a company like Simon &\nSchuster, where one 's life expectancy depends on the number of figures and\ncommas on a spreadsheet.\n\n\nWe 're even more vulnerable now that we are part of a huge\nconglomerate - - Viacom.\n\n\nWhen we are deemed unprofitable, we can be chopped up and absorbed\nby other S&S divisions. \n\n \n\nWhen you decide to visit the US of A, give me a holler.\n\n\nWe 'll have dinner or we can have coffee at Barnes & Noble or watch\na Broadway play.\n\n\nEnclosed is a business card.\n\n\nNotice how I have reinvented myself.\n\n\nThe spelling of my name has changed ( I got tired of correcting\npeople, so I decided to use the English spelling); some things in me have\nchanged.\n\n\nFor one the frilly, short dresses and high stilettos have given way\nto business suits and pumps.\n\n\nI 've added a few pounds.\n\n\nI 'm not fat, just firm.\n\n\nThere 's a little bit of New York intonation when I speak English,\nbut I still rattle words when I talk in Filipino.\n\n\nSo there. \n\n \n\nI hope to see you soon.\n\n\nShould you have a chance to speak to Mr. Sibal, do ask him to call\nme when he is over.\n\n\nI 'll take him to Prentice-Hall and show him the latest technology\nin page composition. \n\n \n\nThank you very much, dear friend, for your support.\n\n\nPlease give my warmest affection to Brother Andrew, Lita Alim and\ncompany. \n\n\n Carla  \n\n\n\n\nDecember 21, 1995\n\n\nDearest Tish,\n\n \n\nToday is the first time I 'm feeling pretty good about the\nSeason, just after my last presentation for the year--oh what a great feeling\nof freedom that is.\n\n\nI bet you 're feeling that way too about the last day of class.\n\n\nWhat better way to celebrate than write a letter--one of the very\nfew I 've written to friends and family all year. \n\n \n\nI came home the day my brother Jess, Cel, their 4 children and 2\nmaids came from Virginia for a visit.\n\n\nYou can imagine how conked out I was those first few days.\n\n\nCora, Lito and Raymond spent Thanksgiving here.\n\n\nOur friend is finding living with her teenager a progressively\ndifficult process.\n\n\nJelo graduated this week.\n\n\nWe hope to spend the time between Christmas and New Year at their\nlovely new home.\n\n\nIt will give me time to look for a carry case for your notebook\ncomputer.\n\n\nCora tried to find it for me when she came, but was unsuccessful.\n\n\n \n\nDid my  Ate  Nina give you the Quicken disks and\nInstruction Manual I left for you?\n\n\nThey didn't want me to send it by mail, but I know how busy everyone\nis, and I just want to ensure myself that you got it.\n\n\nI left Moni the original disks and Manual for it, just in case you\nwould like to see it.\n\n\nI never read the manual myself--every time I wanted to know how\nthings work, I click on \" Help. &rdquo;

Mojares\n\n\nUniversity of San Carlos\n\n\nCebu City\n\n\nDear Dr. Mojares:\n\n \n\nFor several decades now,  DLSU Dialogue  , an\ninterdisciplinary journal for cultural studies, has been serving the academic\ncommunity as a semiannual periodical primarily carrying research articles by\nfaculty of De La Salle University. \n\n \n\nStarting January, 2000, the journal will be transformed into a\nrefereed journal open to contributions from scholars residing both in and\noutside the Philippines.\n\n\nIt will change its focus from general interdisciplinary studies to\nspecifically cultural studies, preferably of the Asia-Pacific geographical\narea to which the Philippines belongs. \n\n \n\nAs it has in the past, the journal will accept both theoretical\nand empirical studies of the usual journal length. \n\n \n\nTo prepare for this change of focus, the journal would like to\nhave an International Editorial Board, whose members will occasionally be\nasked to read and approve articles within their areas of expertise.\n\n\nIt is envisioned that a Board member will read at most one article a\nyear.\n\n\nNeedless to say, there will be a modest honorarium for each reading.\n\n\n \n\nI hope you will join us in this attempt to provide a Philippine\noutlet for serious scholarly efforts in the field of cultural studies. \n\n \n\nThank you very much. \n\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\nIsagani R. Cruz, Ph.D.\n\n\nPublisher and Editor \n\n\n\n\n Manila Critics Circle \n\n\n P. O. Box EA-109, Ermita, Manila 1045, Philippines \n\n\n6 September 2000\n\n\nAtty. Dominador Buhain\n\n\nChairman\n\n\nNational Book Development Board\n\n\nDear Atty. Buhain:\n\n \n\nThe Manila Critics Circle would like to propose for your\nconsideration the sponsorship by the National Book Development Board of the\nNational Book Awards given annually to the best books published in the\nPhilippines. \n\n \n\nAs you know, the Circle has given out the Awards every year since\n1982.\n\n\nThe Awards ordinarily consist of trophies designed by major Filipino\nsculptors ( for example, for the past few years, the Circle has been using a\ndesign by National Artist Napoleon Abueva) or equivalent plaques, given out\nin appropriate ceremonies during the annual Philippine Bookfair held at SM\nMegamall in Mandaluyong City. \n\n \n\nIs it possible for the NBDB to allocate &peso;100,000 for the\nNational Book Awards this year? \n\n \n\nEnclosed are an invitation to last year 's awarding ceremonies,\nwith information on the Circle and on the Awards, and a listing of the books\nthat have won Awards. \n\n \n\nWe hope that you can help us in this endeavor.\n\n\nIt is our understanding that the NBDB is exploring ways to encourage\ngood books by our publishers.\n\n\nThis would be a simple and concrete way to help our publishers. \n\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\nIsagani R. Cruz, Ph.D.\n\n\nChair \n\n\n\n\n13 January 2001\n\n\nDr. Florencia Claveria\n\n\nUniversity Fellow & Dean\n\n\nCollege of Science\n\n\nDear Dr. Claveria:\n\n \n\nThis will introduce the bearer, Ms. Rowena Locsin, who has been\nassigned to you during the Third Term SY 2000-01 as your Student Assistant (\nSA).\n\n\nAs a STUFAP scholar, s/he is expected to render THIRTY ( 30) HOURS of\nservice to you from 22 January to 24 March. \n\n \n\nSTUFAP has requested the Fellows to prepare a regular schedule\nfor the scholars, to be submitted to the STUFAP office by 22 January.\n\n\nPlease ask your SA to furnish me a copy of your agreed schedule. \n\n \n\nSTUFAP also reminds you that  \" should the student\nreport to you as per your agreed schedule but you have no assignment to give\nto the student at that time, please consider the student as to have complied\nwith the hours required for that period.\"  \n\n \n\nIt is important not to assign any work to your SA after 24 March,\nbecause s/he will have to prepare for the final examinations. \n\n \n\nYour SA will fill in the attached Attendance Record.\n\n\nPlease ask her/him to fill in also the \" Remarks &rdquo;\nportion with suggestions for improving the service assistantship program.\n\n\nAt the end of the term, please initial the form before s/he submits\nit to me.\n\n\nI shall then countersign the Record before sending it myself to\nSTUFAP.\n\n\nThe completion of thirty hours of service is a requirement for the\nrenewal of the STUFAP grant for the next term. \n\n \n\nThe STUFAP Committee, in its meeting on 17 March 1995, defined\nthe duties of Student Assistants in this way:  \" These students\nwill render research assistantship and will not be given purely menial\nassignments, routine clerical tasks, or office work.\n\n\nThe reason for this change is to make the Assistantship Program a\ntruly challenging and enriching experience for these deserving grantees.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nAs much as possible, please do not send your SA out of the\ncampus.\n\n\nThere is no insurance program covering their trips outside the\ncampus, and fears have also been raised about their safety.\n\n\nIf an off-campus trip is unavoidable, please be sure to give your SA\nenough money for transportation.\n\n\nNeedless to say, if you ask your SA to do anything that involves\nmoney, such as photocopying, please be sure to advance the money.\n\n\nThe scholars receive only free tuition and fees, and no allowances\nfor books, transportation, or living expenses. \n\n \n\nAny suggestions to improve the program are, of course, welcome.\n\n\nYou may communicate these to me or directly to the STUFAP Director.\n\n\n \n\nThank you very much for your usual cooperation. \n\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\nDr. Isagani Cruz\n\n\nHead, Society of Fellows\n\n\ncc: Ms. Severina Kikuchi, Director, STUFAP \n\n\n\n\n16 August 1999\n\n\nDr. Carmelita I. Quebengco\n\n\nExecutive Vice President\n\n\nDe La Salle University - Manila\n\n\nDear Dr. Quebengco:\n\n \n\nAccording to the Minutes of the Council of Deans Meeting held on\n22 July 1999, Accounting will set up an Extension Office at the Angelo King\nInternational Center to service the needs of CELL and SDRC. \n\n \n\nI wish to formally request that the Accounting Extension Office\nalso serve the needs of the DLSU Press office at the ground floor of the\nAngelo King International Center. \n\n \n\nAs requested by CSB, the DLSU Press office will sell school\nsupplies for the students taking classes at the Center.\n\n\nSince the DLSU Press office serves as the headquarters of its\nnewly-formed Textbook Division, it will also sell textbooks to students and\noutside customers.\n\n\nThe cash receipts at that office can and should be deposited in the\nAccounting Extension Office at the end of each working day. \n\n \n\nWe hope that the extra services of the Accounting Extension\nOffice can be covered by the current Accounting Services monthly fee the DLSU\nPress gives to the Accounting Office. \n\n \n\nThank you very much. \n\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\nIsagani R.

Abad of UP, FEU Chair Dr. Lourdes Montinola,\npossibly Ophie Dimalanta of UST, and I will be hosted for a lunch-meet by Dr.\nIsabel Martin and Marlu Vilches at 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday, Dec. 19 at the\nEnglish Department of Ateneo de Manila University.\n\n\nSorry for this late communication, but I do hope you can join us. \n\n \n\nBelow I reproduce the initial communication I posted to the group.\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\nKrip - - - - - -\n\n\n11 December 2001\n\n\nDear Friends,\n\n \n\nA little over a fortnight ago, I had the opportunity to pay a\ncourtesy call, together with fellow writers Dr. Beni Santos, Mr. Rio Almario,\nMr. Edgar Maranan, and Philippine Ambassador to the United Kingdom Cesar\nBautista, on Ms. Valerie Mitchell, OBE, Director General of the\nEnglish-Speaking Union.\n\n\nIt was Ms. Loline Reed of the Overseas Women 's Club, and a leading\nlight of the Filipino Women 's Association, who arranged the call.\n\n\nThe English-Speaking Union has been at the forefront of efforts to\npropagate, promote and enhance English-language use throughout the world.\n\n\nIt has chapters from practically all of the American states and UK 's\ngeographical units, as well as 42 countries.\n\n\nThe latest chapters to be incorporated are those of Hong Kong and\nThailand, for which reason Ms. Mitchell was scheduled to lead an official\nparty to visit those countries for their formal rites of integration into\nESU.\n\n\nThe wonder of it, as we expressed to Ms. Mitchell, is that the\nPhilippines has yet to be represented in the Union.\n\n\nNeither are Singapore and Malaysia represented, for that matter.\n\n\nMs. Mitchell took pains to explain that chapter membership is granted\nafter an 18-month process from the time a potential country chapter expresses\nits desire to join up, and initiates efforts for the purpose.\n\n\nThese efforts begin with the formation of an organizing committee.\n\n\nIn the case of the Philippines, as a result of the positive meeting\nwe had with Ms. Mitchell, who proved quite gracious and all-too-receptive to\nthe idea of a Philippines chapter, we were advised to take the initiative to\nform this committee as soon as possible.\n\n\nThis organizing committee - - with a membership of anywhere from five\nto nine people, in our case predominantly from the academe as we suggested,\nshould at some point include the Director of The British Council in Manila,\nand eventually, as recommended by Mrs. Mitchell, the Cultural Affairs officer\nof the U.S. Embassy.\n\n\nThe first important task of this committee would be to conduct a\nlocal competition among the students of our major educational institutions to\ndetermine the selection of one or two representatives to the International\nPublic Speaking Competition for the year 2002, to be held in London by May.\n\n\nWe can have one official candidate - age between 16 and 19 as I\nunderstand it - - to be hosted by the ESU at Dartmouth House, its official\nbuilding, while the other representative will be granted a homestay program\nas an observer and/or alternate candidate.\n\n\nI believe they will also be granted stipends.\n\n\nWhat we will have to raise is the funding for their flight tickets.\n\n\n \n\nFor this purpose, it has been suggested by Ms. Mitchell that we\neventually transform the organizing committee to a formal one with membership\noffered to certain businessmen or well-placed individuals, either in business\nor government.\n\n\nIf I recall correctly, Ambassador Bautista suggested having Executive\nSecretary Alberto Romulo, who enjoys wide-ranging relations within the UK,\neventually join the official committee once it 's ready for actual\nincorporation.\n\n\nMrs. Mitchell stressed however that it is essential to form the\ninformal, organizing committee immediately, so that it can serve as the\nselection committee for the two Philippine representatives to the public\nspeaking contest, as well as name two other possible delegates - - one from\nacademe and one from media - - to two other separate conferences sponsored by\nthe ESU in June and July 2002.\n\n\nMrs. Mitchell also gave us a couple of videotapes - - one on the ESU\nand the other on the workings of the public speaking contest - - so that we\ncan get a better idea of both.\n\n\nNow I 'd like to ask you to join the organizing committee for the\nformation of the Philippines chapter of the English-Speaking Union.\n\n\nOff the bat, I believe that the major educational institutions such\nas Ateneo de Manila University, De La Salle University, Far Eastern\nUniversity, University of the Philippines and University of Santo Tomas\nshould be represented in this organizing committee.\n\n\nPotential members - - depending on their willingness and availability\n- - include, apart from the undersigned, the following:\n\n\n( 1) Isabel Martin, Chair, English Dept., Ateneo de Manila\n\n\n( 2) Ma. Luz C. Vilches, Executive Director, Ateneo Center for\nEnglish Language Teaching\n\n\n( 3) Marjorie Evasco, Director, Bienvenido N.

( SSI) to include the amount of\nthe license into the total SSI invoices for the SUN implementation project\nthat we are doing for them.\n\n\nThus the address in the invoice is SSI, whereas the person who made\nthe order was Shell Bangladesh, Attn. Noazesh Choudhury.\n\n\nThis is why we ended up with the bill. \n\n \n\nHowever, we have been advised that Shell Bangladesh has had some\nproblems with their JV partner in Bangladesh and that additional funds will\nbe required from their principal, which in this case is Shell Overseas\nInvestment B. V. ( SOIBV).\n\n\nAt this stage, we have been asked to put the project on hold until\nthe additional funds are received from SOIBV.\n\n\nThis has been a slow process and up to the present, we have not been\nadvised to proceed with the project. \n\n \n\nWe are now looking at a number of options:\n\n\n- Return the software to you ( It is still in Shell Bangladesh,\nunused and sealed).\n\n\n- Send your invoice to Shell Bangladesh and let them sort this out.\n\n\n- Have SSI pay the invoice and SSI invoices Shell Bangladesh in\naccordance with the original request of Shell Bangladesh.\n\n\n- Because of the reduced funding, the possibility exists that only\nSUN Accounts will be required and the SUN Business will have to be returned.\n\n\n \n\nWhat we would like now would be Systems Union advice on the\npossibility of returning the software:\n\n\n- Completely, unused and in the original packing\n\n\n- Partially, to make use of the SUN Accounts only.\n\n\nIf this is possible, please advise if there would be a deadline to\nthis or if there would be a corresponding penalty. \n\n \n\nThank you very much and regards. \n\n\nJet Bautista\n\n\nTel No. +603 251-3844\n\n\nFax No. +603 251-2182 \n\n\n\n\nJuly 5, 2000\n\n\nTo whom it may concern\n\n\nDear Sir or Madam:\n\n \n\nThis is to confirm that we have invited the below-mentioned\nShell Services International B.

Although we understand your reasons for using individual plan\nrather than the corporate group rates for the membership fee, we believe we\nshould apply the corporate group rates for the following reasons:\n\n\ni. Our contract, which was just renewed this year, is for a two year\nperiod which will end on 15 June 1999.\n\n\nIn accordance with the contract, the RAP rates are ( a) &dollar;132\nper individual, and ( b) &dollar;264 per family.\n\n\nii. We noted that the rate for individual membership is very much\nhigher than the present corporate group rate.\n\n\niii.

Cabugao\n\n\nSr. Compensation Officer, BPCB\n\n\nSubject: In-House Pharmacy - Payment for the Cost of the Medicines\n\n \n\n1. Agreement has been reached between BPCB and Philippine\nHealthcare Information & Services, Inc., Contractor for the In-House Pharmacy\non the amount and manner of payment of the medicines turned-over by the\nMedical Services Units to the Pharmacy.\n\n\nThe total cost of the medicines is &peso;1,799,572.44, which will be\npaid over twelve equal monthly installments of &peso;149,964.37 each to\ncommence on 1 April 1998. \n\n \n\n2. We are planning to have the payment credited to the Health\nServices Budget, under account no. 822-9201-129-26.\n\n\nWe intend to use such payment to offset the cost of any enhancements\nto the health care services provided to staff, such as vaccination programs.\n\n\nWe would appreciate it if you could give us your concurrence to the\nproposed method of accounting for and utilizing the payment. \n\n \n\nThank you.  \n\n\n\n\nTo: Headquarters Supporting Staff\n\n\nFrom: Director, BPMSD\n\n\nSubject: 1998 Supporting Staff Pay Increase Distribution\n\n \n\n1. We have just completed the distribution of the 1998 pay\nincreases for supporting staff.\n\n\nThe Advice of Personnel Action ( APAs) will be sent to all\ndepartment/office heads by 7 May. \n\n \n\n2. As stated in my 16 April 1998 memo to you, the pay increases\nare based on a 15.9 percent increase in the salary structure, which is\nreflective of the movement in the market.\n\n\nThus, the Bank 's salary structure for supporting staff has moved by\n15.9 percent,  i.e.  , minimum, midpoint and maximum\nsalaries for levels 1 to 9A have all been raised by 15.9 percent. \n\n \n\n3. Guidelines for the distribution of the pay increases were sent\nto the department/office heads and managers, and four briefing sessions were\nheld by BPCB and BPHR to explain the process.\n\n\nThe guidelines were developed to assist managers and\ndepartment/office heads determine individual pay increases for their staff\nwithin their budgets.\n\n\nThe budgets were determined based on an assumed Bank-wide\ndistribution of staff falling in the \" fully meets or exceeds\nrequirements &rdquo; performance category.\n\n\nAs shown in the Salary Increase Matrix on the overleaf of my 16 April\n1998 memo, this performance category was further divided into three\nsub-categories with salary increase ranges varying by salary quartile, and\nwith the range increases overlapping between sub-categories. \n\n \n\n4. The assumed distribution of staff was 65/25/10,  i.\ne.  , 65 percent of staff would be in the first sub-category\nreflecting average performance, 25 percent would fall in the second\nsub-category pertaining to above average performance, while 10 percent would\nbe in the third sub-category consisting of the outstanding staff.\n\n\nHowever, as explained during the briefing sessions, this distribution\nwas not rigid, and managers and department/office heads had full flexibility\nin allocating increases for as long as they kept within their budgets.\n\n\nIndeed, the final results of the pay distribution show that 51\npercent of staff were placed in the first sub-category, 38 percent were in\nthe second sub-category, and 11 percent were in the third sub-category.\n\n\n( This distribution is based on the use of the midpoints of the\noverlaps as the delineating points between sub-categories.) \n\n \n\n5. In the briefing sessions, it was also stressed that the\nsub-categories were to be used only to determine individual pay increases so\nas to ensure Bank-wide consistency in the allocation of increases to staff\nwith similar performance rating and salary quartile.\n\n\nThere would be no labeling and recording of the sub-categories of\nstaff in their personnel files.\n\n\nIn fact, the overlaps in the salary matrix were introduced to ensure\nthat staff would not be categorized. \n\n \n\n6. For your information, below is a graph showing the Bank-wide\ndistribution of pay increases.\n\n\nPlease note that majority of supporting staff or 61 percent received\nincreases ranging from 17 to 20 percent. \n\n \n\n7. Since this is the first year of the new Performance Management\nSystem and the pay increase distribution using range increases for supporting\nstaff, we will be seeking the comments of the managers and the Staff Council\non the new system, particularly its technical aspects, for possible\nimplementation in the future.  \n\n\n\n\n4 August 1999\n\n\nTo : Supporting Staff\n\n\nFrom : Manager, BPCB\n\n\nSubject :  Dependents Life and Disability Insurance Plan (\nDLDIP) Increase in Coverage of Spouse \n\n \n\n1. Under the Dependents Life and Disability Insurance Plan (\nDLDIP), staff covered under the Group Life Insurance Plan ( GLIP) may insure\ntheir spouse up to the staff member 's GLIP coverage, with the coverage\nexpressed in units of PHP 5,000.\n\n\nSince the GLIP coverage is related to staff salaries, opportunities\nare given periodically for staff to increase the DLDIP coverage of their\nspouses, in proportion to increases in staff salaries. \n\n \n\n2. The last time staff were given the opportunity to increase\ntheir spouses ' coverage was in October 1997, and the increase was based on\nthe salary increases received between January 1996 and September 1997.\n\n\nYou may now wish to increase your spouse 's coverage based on the\nsalary increases you have received since October 1997. \n\n \n\n3. To determine the maximum DLDIP coverage applicable to your\nspouse, the total percentage increase in your salary between 1 October 1997\nand 31 July 1999 will be applied to the current number of units of your\nspouse 's coverage, with the product rounded down to the whole number of\nunits.\n\n\nYour spouse 's current coverage, the maximum coverage, as well as the\ncorresponding monthly premiums will be shown in the Staff Benefits\nInformation System  from 9 to 23 August 1999  .\n\n\nTo access this information in the SBIS, please do the following:\n\n\n- Go to SBIS.\n\n\n- Click on \" Forms\".\n\n\n- Scroll down to and click on \" Request for Increase in Spouse\nDLDIP Coverage\".\n\n\n- Indicate either the number of units or the amount of the New\nCoverage.\n\n\n- Click on \" Show New Premium\".\n\n\n- If you wish to increase coverage of your spouse, click on \"\nPrint Request Form\".\n\n\n- Sign and date the Request Form. \n\n \n\n4. Since the increased coverage is available on a \nno-evidence of insurability basis  , please submit the signed Request\nForm to the Compensation and Benefits Division ( Attention: Gladys Quinto at\nRoom E 2701)  on or before 23 August 1999  .\n\n\nIf you are on mission or on official leave during this period, you\nmay submit the Request Form  no later than the seventh calendar day \nafter you report back to work.\n\n\nYour spouse 's increased coverage will be effective  1 September\n1999  . \n\n \n\n5. If ( i) we receive your Request Form after the applicable\ndeadline, and/or ( ii) you wish to increase your spouse 's coverage up to an\namount which is higher than the maximum coverage shown in the SBIS, but lower\nthan or equal to your own GLIP coverage; please submit a Proof of Health form\nto the Compensation and Benefits Division, for transmittal to the insurer.\n\n\nIf the insurer approves the Proof of Health form, then the effective\ndate of your spouse 's coverage will be the date of approval by the insurer.\n\n\n \n\n6. Please call Gladys Quinto at 4415 or Alona Regulto at 4480 if\nyou have any questions regarding this memo.  \n\n\n\n\n18 June 1997\n\n\nTo : Director, BPMSD\n\n\nThrough : Deputy Director ( Budget and Compensation), BPMSD\n\n\nFrom : Manager, BPCB\n\n\nSubject : Renewal of Emergency Assistance Contract with AEA\nInternational Assistance Services ( Philippines) Inc.\n\n \n\n1. The contract with AEA expired on 15 June 1997.\n\n\nHowever, we were held covered pending resolution of the membership\nfees applicable for the renewal year. \n\n \n\n2. In their letter dated 2 June 1997 ( Annex 1), AEA had proposed\nmembership fee increases averaging 8.44 percent, plus imposition of 10\npercent VAT.\n\n\nAEA confirmed that the Bank 's experience has been good but justified\nthe increase by citing escalation in administrative costs.\n\n\nWe countered by asking them to propose a two year contract with fixed\nmembership fees.\n\n\nA two year contract would provide stability in costs as well as\nreduce administrative work.\n\n\nWe also objected to the 10 percent VAT, and advised them to issue the\npolicy out of Hong Kong. \n\n \n\n3. AEA has now submitted a revised proposal dated 17 June 1997\nwith membership fee increases averaging 5.69 percent ( Annex 2).\n\n\nThis percentage growth translates to an increase of around\n&dollar;1,700 in the membership fee for 1997/1998 bringing the membership\nfees to &dollar;31,356. 16.\n\n\n( Please see Annex 3.)\n\n\nAEA has also agreed to issue the policy out of Hong Kong. \n\n \n\n4. We therefore recommend the renewal of the contract with AEA\nfor two years ending 15 June 1999 at the membership fees stated in AEA 's\nletter dated 17 June 1997.  \n\n\nTo : \n\n\nFrom: Maria Guia B.

Geographical Limits: AEA provides broader coverage since they\ncover all travels outside the city of the duty station, whereas SOS cover\nonly travels outside a radius of 100 miles from the duty station or outside\nthe Member 's country of residence.\n\n\n2. Coverage: The coverages are broadly the same, although SOS has a\nmaximum limit for the cost of the medical evacuation and repatriation while\nAEA has no limit.\n\n\nHowever, SOS provides additional non-medical services, although\nthese are not really essential services.\n\n\nThe exclusions are also similar.\n\n\n3.

&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nIf your answer to all of the above questions is NO, then your PPR\nprobably can qualify for a BLUE rating.\n\n\nIf your answer to any of the above is YES, then you need to improve\nnot just how you write your PPR, but maybe even how you are managing your\nproject. \n\n \n\nIf you are an Operations Manager or a PM SLL, and one of your PMs\nanswered YES to the above, then your PPR meetings are not as effective as\nthey should be. \n\n \n\nThe PPR needs to reflect not just the current status of the\nproject; it also needs to show that you as PM are fully in control of your\nproject.\n\n\nYou are managing not just the deliverables, resources and financials,\nbut you are also managing the risks and issues in the project.\n\n\nGoing a step further, you see the opportunities for additional\nbusiness with the client, and are able to maximize these opportunities. \n\n \n\nThe section on Issues and Problems should contain not just\nproduct problems and TARs.\n\n\nMore importantly, it needs to contain project risks and issues that\nmay or are already impacting project success.\n\n\nChange Requests should be raised not just for matters that entail an\nincrease in mandays or costs - - PMs need to be conscious of any change that\nis significant: client delays or initiatives that will affect schedules, CRs\nthat will impact cash flow, data problems that can cause delays, \netc. \n\n\nThese Change Requests can be raised against the client, against\nanother LOB, or even against the practice.\n\n\nAnd as you all know, having an external and internal PPR gives us the\nopportunity to raise sensitive issues/risks/matters internally - - and these\nare matters that we can bring up for discussion and escalation during the\nmonthly PPR meetings. \n\n \n\nSo next time you write a PPR, look at your project with the eyes\nof a healthchecker, and write down what you see.\n\n\nAnd hopefully the person who will read your PPR will see BLUE. \n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nGigi \n\n\n\n\nDate: Tue, 06 Mar 2001 15:53:22 +0800\n\n\nFrom: Gigi Rapadas \n\n\nTo: Peter Cooper \n\n\nSubject:  URGENT: Request for Approval to Hire Replacement HC:\nProject Accountant \n\n\nHi Peter,\n\n \n\nI am requesting your approval to hire xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx,\nCPA, to fill the dual roles of:\n\n\na.

Bottom Up \n\n\n1. PDs have been given a deadline of end-July to finish the\nOPAS/Training Development Plans for all their staff.\n\n\n2.

These SLLs will coordinate with the divisional and global SLLs on\nPRP demands.\n\n\nThey will also coordinate with country SLLs on special requirements.\n\n\n3. RPD to provide major focus areas ( business plans) and\ncommunicate to me.\n\n\n4. PDs and SLLs to communicate any special training needs to me\nbased on their own business plans and the PRP process, if these have not been\nfiltered down to the consultant demand deposit level yet. \n\n \n\nSome agreements:\n\n\n1. We will fully utilize the OUWeb features and facilities.\n\n\n2. All courses will now go through OUWeb: registrations,\ncancellations, costing,  etc. \n\n\nDemand will also be derived from OUWeb.\n\n\n3. Ownership of the training responsibility must be the individual 's,\nand this message must be constantly communicated.\n\n\n4. The country SLLs will track accomplishment of training plans.\n\n\n5. The country PDs will follow up the status of Learning Labs in\ntheir subs.\n\n\n6.

In case we need to post a training demand but have not\nidentified the attendees yet, is there a way to post this onto OUWeb through\nusing say, a \" dummy &rdquo; name/s?\n\n\nWe would want this demand to be consolidated with the individual\nfuture demand deposits of our staff. \n\n \n\nIn addition, we feel strongly as a group that the policy on\nreplacements should be revised.\n\n\nWe accept that cancellations with less than 10 working days notice\nshould incur penalties, but replacements from the same practice must be\nallowed.\n\n\nWe feel that replacements can be done without sacrificing the\nquality of attendees, as we now have enough consultants in all our practices\nto do this.\n\n\nPlease reconsider. \n\n \n\nBy the way, I will be in Singapore again next week.\n\n\nIf you are there Wednesday afternoon ( July 12), it would be good to\nmeet with you again. \n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nGigi", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a640fac0-9100-4f1e-8fa9-afe628941149", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.156723+00:00"}

Byung-Hoon Lee \n\n\n\n\n28 November 2001\n\n\nTO: ELED Faculty\n\n\nFROM: DT Dayag\n\n\nSUBJECT: Proposal to Change Department 's Name\n\n \n\nAt the ELED fulltimers ' meeting held 26 November, I proposed\nthat the name of the department be changed to one that will be reflective of\nthe thrust and research agenda of the department and that will erase the\nconfusion arising from the use by the Educational Leadership Department of\nthe acronym ELD, which we had adopted for many years before we decided in\n1999 to merge with the College of Education.\n\n\nWhile those in attendance at the meeting unanimously approved the\nproposal, the body failed to agree on the proposed new name \"\nDepartment of English and Applied Linguistics ( DEAL) \" since there\nwere a number of key issues raised in connection with it.\n\n\nThe first issue had to do with the observation that all departments\nunder the College of Education need to include in their nomenclature the word\n\" \" education &rdquo; \" to reflect their affiliation\nwith the CED.\n\n\nThe second was that a department that would go by the name \"\n\" Department of English and Applied Linguistics &rdquo; \"\nmight send the signal that it is allied with the humanities and that it\nbelongs to the College of Liberal Arts. \n\n \n\nYesterday, I met with Dr. Allan B. I. Bernardo, CED Dean, to talk\nabout the proposal and the above issues raised at the fulltimers ' meeting.\n\n\nHe said we could go ahead with \" \" DEAL &rdquo;\n\" since the more relevant issue here is the identity of the\ndepartment rather than its affiliation with a college. \n\n \n\nBut why Department of English and Applied Linguistics ( DEAL)?\n\n\nAside from the factor of easy name recall, the proposed name has the\nadvantage of reflecting our distinct identity as an English department, but\nat the same time, it mirrors the expansion of the vision and research agenda\nof the department resulting from our merger in 1999 with the CED and the\ncorresponding transfer to the department of the M.A. and Ph.D. programs\noffered by the defunct Language Education Department.\n\n\nIn addition, the use of \" \" applied linguistics &rdquo;\n\" is justified if we look at the field in a broader sense to include\nnot only language teaching but the hyphenated subfields of linguistics,\n e.g.  sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, as well. \n\n \n\nHaving said that, I would like to get your consensus on the\nmatter before I present it at the CED Council of Chairs meeting on December\n5.\n\n\nCould you therefore fill out the slip below and return it to Nilda\nASAP? \n\n \n\nThank you. \n\n \n\nDirection: Please tick off your preference. \n\n\n_____ I am in favor of changing ELED 's name to Department of English\nand Applied Linguistics ( DEAL).\n\n\n_____ I am not in favor of changing ELED 's name to DEAL.\n\n\nI would like to propose this name instead:\n_________________________________________. \n\n\n\n\n28 November 2001\n\n\nTO: DR.

DAYAG\n\n\nChairperson, English Language Education Department\n\n\nSUBJECT:  Request for Approved Absences \n\n \n\nI am very pleased to inform you that your student CHEVY ERALI\nCONTRERAS ( third year BSC-Marketing) has been chosen by the English Language\nEducation Department as the official representative of the university and of\nthe country to the Digital Campus Consortium ( DCC) International Student\nSymposium to be held on December 5, 6, and 7, 2001, at Waseda University,\nTokyo, Japan.\n\n\nThis symposium is an offshoot of the ongoing Cross-Cultural Distance\nLearning, an online chat project involving students of DLSU-Manila and of\nWaseda University, that began sometime in 1999.\n\n\nIt is a gathering of student-representatives from Asia and the\nPacific who are taking part in the project. \n\n \n\nAware of the importance of the symposium to the university and to\nthe country, I would like to request that Ms. Contreras be excused from all\nher classes on the above-mentioned dates.\n\n\nI would also appreciate it if you could allow her to attend to her\nvisa application at the Japanese embassy on November 22, without having to be\nmarked absent on that day. \n\n \n\nYour favorable action on the matter will be highly appreciated.\n \n\n\n\n\n23 November 2001\n\n\nTO: ELED Faculty\n\n\nFROM: DT Dayag\n\n\nSUBJECT:  PAASCU Reaccreditation Visit \n\n \n\nIn connection with the PAASCU Reaccreditation visit scheduled\nfor December 3-4, I would like to remind you about the following matters\nrelated to the area of Classroom Instruction:\n\n \n\n1. Avoid getting absent from or being late for your class on\nDecember 3-4. \n\n \n\n2. NO early dismissal; NO substitution; NO transfer of rooms.\n\n\nOn the latter, Oralcomm teachers have to make sure that performances\nwill be held in the original classroom assigned to the class.\n\n\nThe Vice Chair will not entertain any request for change of rooms on\nthe two PAASCU days. \n\n \n\n3. Reserve a seat near the door of your classroom for PAASCU\naccreditor and have a copy of your course syllabus ready.\n\n\nI will appreciate it if you can highlight in your syllabus the\nlesson/activity or activities scheduled for the day, or better still, if you\ncan come up with an abbreviated lesson plan.\n\n\nIf you opt for the second, you may want to write it on the board or\nprepare a clean hard copy ( placed in a folder) for the accreditor 's\nconsumption. \n\n \n\n4. As I have said time and again, ELED faculty should be\nexemplars of good English.\n\n\nThis means that our utterances in class are in straight, accurate\nand appropriate English.\n\n\nAnd that rules out the use of Filipino or Taglish ( code-switching)\nin the English class.\n\n\nAs I mentioned in my 1998 memorandum on the ELED language policy,\neven Tagalog speech fillers and tags such as  di ba  , \nparang  ,  ano  ,  bale  , and the\nlike, interspersed with English utterances, do not have a place in an English\nclass.\n\n\nWe should also make an effort to remind our students about the need\nto speak in straight English when they are in the English class. \n\n \n\n5. Apart from mastery and organization of subject matter and\nclassroom management, PAASCU accreditors will take a very close look at the\nfollowing characteristics of effective instruction: ( a) Ability to answer\nquestions, ( b) Openness to students ' opinions, ( c) Ability to provoke\ncritical and analytic thinking, ( d) Ability to motivate, ( e) Question\ntechnique, ( f) Use of teaching aids, and ( g) Class participation.\n\n\nIn connection with ( f), if you will have to use OHP transparencies,\nmake sure that these are good reproductions of your lecture notes, NOT poor\ncopies of pages of a book.\n\n\nIn addition, they should NOT be text-based,  i.e.\n the text should be accompanied by some graphics.\n\n\nOn ( g), please keep in mind that in an English class, there should\nbe more STUDENT TALK than TEACHER TALK.\n\n\nTo carry this injunction out, I would like to suggest that you\nreserve for the two PAASCU days your \" best &rdquo; activity, \ni.e.  one that will ensure maximum class participation. \n\n \n\n6. Lastly, you will all agree with me that teaching is a\nperformance.\n\n\nMay I therefore call on all of you to put your best foot forward in\nthose two days as our way of supporting the Administration in its effort\ntowards achieving Level III accreditation for the College of Education. \n\n \n\nThanks for all the support and cooperation. \n\n\ncc.

All furniture or equipment located in \" public &rdquo; or\ncommon areas,  e.g.  , corridors, conference rooms,\ncovered walks,  etc.  , should be assumed as properties of\nthe University in general.\n\n\nSince such properties are under the care of Administrative Services,\nby default, as the office head, my permission would be necessary to relocate\nthem. \n\n \n\nThe movement of items normally used for functions or activities,\n e.g.  , chairs, tables, bulletin boards,  etc.\n , is not covered by this memo. \n\n \n\nThank you.  \n\n\n\n\n26 June 2002\n\n\nMr. Dale Ian A.

Gamboa\n\n\nStudent 's Rights and Welfare\n\n\nCommittee Chairperson\n\n\nDear Mr. Gamboa:\n\n \n\nI should be the one responding to your letter to Mr. Roy\nFaelnar, owner of Filtrex photocopying services, because it is my office that\nis responsible for the arrangements with the photocopying services\nconcessionaire. \n\n \n\nA few months ago, my attention was already called about the\nschedule of lunch breaks of the machine operators.\n\n\nI then advised Mr. Faelnar to require the operators to take their\nbreaks in shifts.\n\n\nThey are trying to do this as much as possible, however, we also\nhave to consider that the operators cannot insist on their customers that\nthey have to go on a break at the middle of a job request or when there are\nthose in line waiting to be served.\n\n\nHence, what actually happens is that they take their breaks when\nthere are no more customers to attend to and therefore the time shifts can\nhardly be followed. \n\n \n\nAnyway, I again asked Mr. Faelnar to remind the operators about\nthe need to take their breaks in shifts.\n\n\nHowever, if the students would like to be assured that there is a\nmachine in operation at any time during the day, please advise them to\nproceed to the Library.\n\n\nSince there are a number of machines at close distances to each\nother over there, the operators can easily coordinate among themselves as to\nwhen they take their breaks. \n\n \n\nWith regard to the installation of a photocopying machine at\nthe STRC Building, I regret to inform you that such may no longer be\npossible.\n\n\nThe machine at the PE and Sports Building, which is supposed to\nalso serve the requirements at the STRC Building, is already an accommodation\nthat the concessionaire is extending to us because it is not even earning\nenough to cover the cost of operation.\n\n\nTo add another unit at the STRC Building will already unfairly\noverburden the concessionaire.\n\n\nWe hope the students will understand this limitation. \n\n \n\nThank you. \n\n\nYours truly,\n\n\nMr. Enrico J.

Speaking of Miss Morrow, while it 's true that she stays in Cabiao\nher service area is the entire province of Nueva Ecija.\n\n\nHaving worked with her for 18 months, I believe in her fairness,\notherwise, I should not have allowed her to judge since my school was also\ncompeting;\n\n\n3.

Please let us know how the total area of 6,770.98 sq.m. was\ncomputed.\n\n\nIn our simple computation, the total area of the 12 units per floor\nis 330.98 sq.m. and granting that there are 23 floors, the total area should\nbe 7,612.54 sq.m.\n\n\nThis does not even take into account the fact that the first two\nfloors should have a bigger area and, also, the floors being used as your own\nresidence undoubtedly have a bigger area. \n\n \n\n2. We are shocked that your estimated monthly electric bill of\n&peso;53,000 would now increase by more than 200% to &peso;183,000 as per\nyour revised estimate dated September 1.\n\n\nWe would like to know what electrical equipment, machinery, and\nlighting fixtures are being serviced by Meralco meter no. xxxxxx. \n\n \n\n3. We are also shocked that your estimated monthly water bill of\n&peso;4,000 would now increase by 200% to &peso;12,000 as per your revised\nestimate dated September 1, considering that there has been no increase in\nthe common areas.\n\n\nWe would like to receive documentation supporting this proposed\nincrease. \n\n \n\n4. We would also like to request a listing of office\nequipment/furniture/fixtures amounting to &peso;60,000 supported by invoices.\n\n\n \n\n5. We would like to reiterate our request for a listing of the\nunits sold per floor and their respective owners. \n\n \n\n6. We would also like to inform you that we intend to exercise\nour right under the Corporation Code to inspect the books of the condominium\ncorporation. \n\n \n\nWe will withhold payment until after all these concerns have been\naddressed to our full satisfaction. \n\n\nYours truly,\n\n\nTeresita B.

Colina  :\n\n \n\nThank you for your letter of January 9. \n\n \n\nWe hope that your books will reveal the information as to why we\nare being assessed &peso;59.94 per square meter, from the original assessment\nof &peso;40.00.\n\n\nAttached is our letter of September 18, 2001; please note that\nQuestions 1, 2, and 3 have not been answered. \n\n \n\nAlthough Mrs.\n\n\n Canlas  wrote us a letter on October 2 itemizing replies to\n1, 2, 3, and 5, the points she makes ( complete with insults) really do not\nanswer Questions 1, 2, and 3. \n\n \n\nFor Question 1, she gives receipts for association dues for the\nunits/floors owned by  Canlas Properties  , but what we want to know\nis very simple - the area for each floor and the total for the 22 floors, to\nexplain the discrepancy between your computation of 6,770.98 sq.m. versus our\ncomputation of 7,283.32 sq.m. ( 331.06 sq.m./floor x 22 floors). \n\n \n\nFor Question 2, Mrs.  Canlas  said:  \" You\nwere asking what machineries,  etc.  were tapped with\nMeralco meter No. xxxxxxx, I think it 's a waste of time answering this since\nyou do not trust us. &rdquo; \n\n\nThis does not answer our question.\n\n\nWe are willing to trust Mrs.  Canlas  , a Board member at\nthat, but she must give us a reason to trust her.\n\n\nInstead, she heaps insults on us, in effect saying  \nhindi kami sanay tumira sa condo o village, wala kaming matinong isip, wala\nkaming common sense at fair judgment.  \n\n\nThe question is simple: With all due respect, may we know what\nequipment, machinery, fixtures are serviced by this particular Meralco meter.\n\n\n \n\nFor Question 3, we have studied Annex 16, but without any\nexplanation from Mrs.  Canlas  or you, we cannot see the connection\nbetween our inquiry and that particular receipt from Maynilad Water.\n\n\nIt is questions like these that we would have wanted to discuss in\nthe meeting that we were requesting with the Board. \n\n \n\nFor your information, we have taken the trouble of making a\nsurvey of the condominium units around De La Salle University.\n\n\nWe have found out that the association dues being charged by \nFlorentino Tower  and  Topaz Balconies  are much lower than the\ndues that you are assessing - and they offer much better amenities.\n\n\nWe have learned that  Florentino Tower  , which has a big\nlobby, a beautiful swimming pool, a gym, a function room, and three\nelevators, charges &peso;42.00 per square meter, while  Topaz Balconies\n , also with a lobby, a swimming pool, a gym, a game room, a function\nroom, and three elevators, charges &peso;35.00 per square meter.\n\n\nNotice that your  original  assessment of &peso;40.00 per\nsquare meter is completely in line with what those two condominium buildings\nare charging. \n\n \n\nFor this reason, we really would like answers to our questions so\nthat we can see the justification for the increase of almost 50% in the\nassociation dues starting October 2001.\n\n\nSince Mrs.  Canlas  has been expressing her anger at us ( both\nin letters and in person), we might as well also mention our frustration with\nthe  Canlases  . \n\n \n\nMay we remind you that per contract to sell, you were supposed to\ndeliver the units to us in October 1998, but - understanding the economic\nrealities of the times - we patiently waited until the units were given to us\nin May 2001.\n\n\nNow that we are withholding the payment of the balance between the\noriginal assessment and the revised assessment of our association dues until\nour objections are answered, you are slapping a 4% monthly interest on the\nbalance.\n\n\nWhen you were selling the units to us, your brochure promised an\nattractive lobby, parquet floors, and wooden base; notice that we did not\npress the issue when these were not given to us.\n\n\nWe wanted to have a member on the Board so that all transactions\ncould be explained to the minority credibly and so that we could have a voice\non the Board, but that role in the Corporation was denied us; we accepted\nthat defeat graciously. \n\n \n\nIn short, we are willing to meet the  Canlases  halfway if\nthey are willing to do the same.\n\n\nMrs.  Canlas  says,  \" We are here as a family,\nso we have to contribute. &rdquo; \n\n\nYou know that we are willing to contribute, and we have been doing so\nfaithfully since the very beginning, in 1996, when we started paying for our\nunits, but give us a solid justification before asking us to increase our\ncontribution.\n\n\nAnd treat us like family, not as your enemies.\n\n\nWe too have a stake in  Magnificence Tower  Condominium\nCorporation. \n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nTeresita B.

Trance\n\n\nDLSUFA President\n\n\nRe:  Result of the Negotiations in the Multisectoral Committee on\nBudget ( MSCB) for Tuition Fee Increase ( TFI) \n\n \n\nThis is to inform you that during its seventh ( 7th) meeting held\nlast Thursday, February 9, the MSCB decided to set the average TFI for SY\n1999-2000 at 12%.\n\n\nThis translates into a 10.5% TFI for upperclassmen and 16.5% TFI for\nfreshmen. \n\n \n\nThe initial meeting of the MSCB was held on 3 December 1998.\n\n\nDuring this meeting, the ground rules for the negotiations were\nagreed upon.\n\n\nThe second meeting was held January 5, 1999.\n\n\nAfter this, the MSCB met regularly every Tuesday from 12 noon to 2:30\np.m. \n\n \n\nThe initial proposals of the different sectors were:\n\n\nAdministration: 11% - 18%\n\n\nStudents: 5% - 7%\n\n\nFaculty: 15% - 18%\n\n\nPUSO  : 7% - 9%\n\n\n \n\nWhile the DLSUEA  initially\nannounced that they will not submit any proposal for the TFI and will simply\ngo along with the majority decision, on the sixth meeting, their President\nmade it known to the body that the employees and staff would like to have no\nless than last year 's average TFI which was 12.875%. \n\n \n\nAfter much discussion which touched upon inflation rates ( both\ncurrent and projected), economic difficulties, working conditions of DLSU\nfaculty compared with their counterparts in other schools, cost of quality\neducation and the like, the MSCB finally came up with the decision mentioned\nabove. \n\n \n\nUnlike last year 's negotiations, the conduct of this year 's\nMSCB meetings remained very proper, amicable and professional.\n\n\nThis could be mainly attributed to the level-headed, diplomatic and\nskillfull leadership of the presiding officer, Mr. Eric Musngi, the PUSO\nPresident. \n\n \n\nThose who participated in the MSCB deliberations this year are:\n\n\n PUSO Representatives  : \n\n\n Student Council Representatives  : \n\n\n Administration Representatives  : \n\n\n DLSUFA Representatives  : \n\n\n DLSUEA Representatives  :  \n\n \n\nAlthough she did not attend any meetings of the MSCB, Ms.\nCristela Goce-Dakila also helped in gathering data and making analysis for\nuse of the FA representatives in presenting the FA stand during the MSCB\nmeetings. \n\n \n\nUnlike in the previous years where the average TFI automatically\nresulted in an almost similar across-the-board faculty salary increase, this\nwill not be the case this year.\n\n\nThe reason is that we are currently restructuring the faculty salary\nscale in order to remove overlaps in consecutive ranks.\n\n\nThe purpose of overlaps is to ensure that any upward movement in rank\nwill carry with it a corresponding financial reward.\n\n\nIn view of the restructuring, it is possible that some of us will get\nhigher than 12% salary increase while others will get lower than 12% salary\nincrease.\n\n\nWe have not yet finalized the proposed restructured salary scale but\nwe will inform you about it as soon as we can. \n\n \n\nRest assured that we are doing our best to get results that will\nbe most beneficial to the faculty in general. \n\n \n\nThank you for cooperation and support for the decisions of the\nDLSUFA Executive Board.  \n\n\n\n\nDe La Salle University\n\n\nAccounting Office\n\n\nOctober 9, 1998\n\n\n TO: ALL PETTY CASH CUSTODIANS \n\n\n FROM: THE CONTROLLER \n\n\n Re:  Reminder on the Handling of Petty Cash Funds \n\n\n \n\nLast May 31, 1998 the Audit Department conducted their annual\naudit of the University 's various Petty Cash Funds.\n\n\nHerewith are their findings and recommendations. \n\n \n\n  Finding no. 1   :\n\n\nThe policy on petty cash replenishment is not strictly being\nfollowed.\n\n\nSome of the custodians resort to using personal money when they run\nout of fund which resulted to cash overage. \n\n \n\n  Recommendation   :\n\n\nThe Petty Cash Custodians must strictly observe the policy on petty\ncash replenishment which states that,  \" When the petty cash\nfund expenses has reached 70% of the fund, they should request for\nreplenishment\". \n\n\nMingling of personal funds with the petty cash fund is prohibited.\n\n\n \n\n  Finding no. 2   :\n\n\nSome petty cash custodians do not use petty cash vouchers to support\ndisbursement from the fund. \n\n \n\n  Recommendation   :\n\n\nAll payments from the petty cash fund should be covered by petty cash\nvoucher.\n\n\nThe voucher must bear approval of the authorized signatory to the\nfund.\n\n\nUpon replenishment a summary of all expenses must be prepared grouped\ninto category of expenses approved by the authorized signatory and submitted\nto Accounting Office for replenishment. \n\n \n\n  Finding no. 3   :\n\n\nSome custodians failed to liquidate their petty cash fund upon\nresignation or retirement. \n\n \n\n  Recommendation   :\n\n\nPetty Cash Custodians are required to liquidate or make a turn-over\nof their accountability when they resign or retire.\n\n\nAlso, custodians are required to hand-over their petty cash funds to\ntheir Heads when they go on long leave of absence.\n\n\nThe Head will then appoint a temporary custodian until his/her\nreturn.\n\n\nContractual Staff are disqualified from being appointed petty cash\ncustodians as they are not employees of the University. \n\n \n\nPlease be guided accordingly. \n\n\n Noted by: \n\n\n DR.

Expenses for Foreign Travel \n\n \n\nTravel grants shall be evidenced by official communications from\nbusiness/university associates abroad indicating the purpose of the meetings.\n\n\nBusiness conventions shall be evidenced by official\ninvitations/communications from the host organization or entity abroad.\n\n\nOtherwise, the entire cost thereof shouldered by the employer shall\nbe treated as taxable fringe benefits of the employee. \n\n \n\n Limits  :\n\n\n( 1) Food, beverages and local transportation amounting to an\naverage of US&dollar;300.00 or less per day shall not be subject to a fringe\nbenefit tax.\n\n\n( 2) 30% of the cost of first class airplane ticket shall be subject\nto a fringe benefit tax. \n\n\n 3.

No. 7356 have in the past been made on recommendation of the\nCommittees concerned.\n\n\nEach committee had a budget and grants were processed as received,\nbeing evaluated in the light of the Committee 's approved program and other\nactivities for the year. \n\n \n\nThe new competitive grants program ( described in the attached\nProponent 's Guide to NCCA Grants Programs) are in addition to\nCommittee-based grants and has the aim of reaching talented artists who may\notherwise be outside the NCCA Committee network.\n\n\nSpecial Evaluation Committees are being constituted from among\nrecognized artists, including those who may otherwise not be available to\nwork with the NCCA.\n\n\nThe first set of applications ( those received as of June 15) are the\nones that we propose to submit to the Special Committee. \n\n \n\nWe are hoping that you will join us in this undertaking which\nwould involve possibly one or two meetings at most, so that the NCCA\ncommunity can benefit from your experience.\n\n\nWe would also be very interested in your suggestions on how to\nfurther encourage artists, through the NCCA Grants Program.\n\n\nSubject to the availability of the Committee members, we propose to\nhold the Committee 's meeting at 10:00 a.m. through lunch on Wednesday, July\n8 at the NCCA Board Room. \n\n \n\nWith kind regards. \n\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\n JAIME C.

Manila\n\n\nDear Dr. Sarile:\n\n \n\nI am very pleased to submit the complete report of the\nDepartment of English and Comparative Literature, College of Arts and Letters\n( DECL, CAL) in connection with its bid to be the Center of Excellence in the\nEnglish Language. \n\n \n\nThe DECL staff has meticulously compiled data to quantify the\ncriteria on the COE.\n\n\nBut since final evaluation, after all, will have to consider\nqualitative grounds, I should like to highlight some strengths of our English\nLanguage program.\n\n\nThese are:\n\n\n1. Its curricular program\n\n \n\nOnly the DECL has a full-blown English Studies: Language program\nwhich includes the B.A., M.A., and Ph. D. levels.\n\n\nIt is the only program with a B.A. in English Studies thus providing\na solid undergraduate matrix for its graduate offerings. \n\n\n2. The integration of curricular and extra-curricular programs\nwithin one structure, not disparate ones.\n\n \n\nCombined under one wing are the Intensive English Program for\nforeigners, the Summer Institute for Teachers of Language and Literature, the\nExtension Programs on Professional Communication, and the three-tiered\ncurricular program on English Studies.\n\n\nThis structure makes possible a sharing of vision and resources\nthrough a mutually enriching arrangement. \n\n\n3. A large enrolment in, and turnout of graduates from all three\nlevels of the English Studies Program ( please see figures in the attached\nreport).\n\n \n\nIn this respect, the DECL has had a strong impact on English\nlanguage education and English related professions such as law, advertising,\nmass communication, human resource development, foreign service, tourism,\n etc.  \n\n\n4. Its interdisciplinary orientation, thus challenging traditional\nborders of the discipline.\n\n \n\nThe curriculum provides solid background in the sub-fields of\nlinguistics and the various approaches to it.\n\n\nIt has, however, opened itself up to other disciplines by providing\nfor electives.\n\n\nThe faculty have also introduced Critical Discourse Analysis and\nother related fields which build on an interplay of Language, Literary Theory\nand Critical Practice.\n\n\nAll English Studies majors are given adequate background in\nLiterature.\n\n\nThus, the faculty 's research and publications in language,\nliterature and culture dovetails with this interdisciplinary perspective.\n\n\n\n5. Its Distance Education Component\n\n \n\nThe DECL faculty have designed distance education modules for\n\" \" Problems in Rhetoric &rdquo; \" , a course towards\nthe M.A. in Language Studies ( Distance Education Mode) and for Communication\nI and Communication II ( Freshman English).\n\n\nThe Distance Education program explores alternative approaches to\nteaching the English Language; likewise, it widens access to English Language\nStudies in the Philippines. \n\n\n6. The solid qualifications of its faculty and the University 's\ncontinuing faculty development programs\n\n \n\nNo other Department of English can match the number of Ph.D. and\nM.A. degree holders in the DECL and the junior faculty with M.A. units.\n\n\nAlmost all have been productive in terms of research and\npublications.\n\n\nThe faculty have been exposed to centers of knowledge in various\nparts of the world. \n\n\n7. Its valuable service to a large General Education English Program\n( G.E.).\n\n\nThe DECL services between 2,500 to 3,000 through its regular G.E.\ncourse offerings and through the ancillary services of the Language\nLaboratory, the Learning Resource Center and the Audio-Visual Rooms. \n\n \n\nWith these distinctive features and quality involvement in the\nspheres of teaching, research and extension I am confident the Department of\nEnglish and Comparative Literature, College of Arts and Letters shall be\ndeemed worthy to be the Center of Excellence in the English Language. \n\n \n\nThank you. \n\n\nTruly yours,\n\n\nPROF.

{"text": "The Thomasites Revisited: A Few Instructive Notes on\nEnglish Language Teaching in the Philippines during the Early American Period\n \n\n\n Wilfredo L. Alberca \n\n\n Polytechnic University of the Philippines \n\n\n  Preliminaries  \n\n \n\nNearly a century after English was introduced to the Philippines,\nthe question of whether or not the Filipino has acquired acceptable or better\nfacility in the language continues to be a major concern among the country 's\nleaders and educators.\n\n\nIf comparisons are to be made, today 's English teacher is likely to\nreceive a less satisfactory rating than his or her counterpart in the first\ndecade of English language teaching in the country.\n\n\nThe perception is, in fact, that the pioneering group of English\nteachers, now conveniently known as  Thomasites  , has a more\nrightful claim to success than the post-war generation of English teachers.\n\n\n \n\nWhatever success then can be attributed to the Thomasites in the\narea of English language teaching may be better appreciated if all available\ninformation about the drama, as it were, in which they acted can be presented\nagain.\n\n\nIf it is true that the Thomasites ' contribution in the area of\nEnglish language teaching is monumental, any effort to revisit it will be a\ndeserved tribute to these pioneer teachers of English in the Philippines.\n\n\nWhile it is true that some studies have been done along this area (\n e.g.  Muerman 1992; Quirante 1953; Lardizabal 1956;\nPecson and Racelis 1959; Sibayan and Gonzalez 1990), there is need for more\ndetailing of the way English was taught by the Thomasites in the country.\n\n\nSuch an effort will explain the phenomenal success of the Americans\nin teaching English compared to the lack of success of Spaniards in teaching\nSpanish or even of post-war Filipino teachers of English.\n\n\nWhat is needed are empirical data which would validate or contradict\nthe various theories of this historical fact. \n\n\n  The Thomasites Reintroduced  \n\n \n\nAs explained in a doctoral study ( Lardizabal 1956: 1), the word\n \" Thomasite \"  originated from  \"\nThomas \"  , the name given to the ship which transported about\n500 American teachers from San Francisco, California to the Philippines.\n\n\nAs in Lardizabal 's study, the appellation \" Thomasites\n\" is used in this paper as a generic name for the early American\nteachers regardless of whether they rode on the transport  Thomas \nor not.\n\n\nAlthough this was not the first or the last ship to carry American\nteachers to the Philippines (  Buford  ,  Deric  , \nMeade  ,  Sherman  , and  Sheridan  were five of the\nother ships), it was responsible for transporting the biggest number of\nteacher passengers.\n\n\nThe fact that it was also the longest and the best of the army\ntransport on the Pacific at the time may partly explain the stronger\nassociation of its name with the pioneer American teachers transported to\nPhilippine shores. \n\n \n\nWith the exception of Arizona, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, and\nOklahoma, all of the American states contributed their share of Thomasites.\n\n\nThe biggest number came from New York; California was next;\nMassachusetts ranked third; and Michigan, fourth.\n\n\nDr. Fred Atkinson, then the General Superintendent of Public\nInstruction, explains the recruitment process the Thomasites went through:\n \n\n \n\nBrown ( 1903:247) summarizes the qualifications required of the\napplicants: ( 1) either normal or college graduation or an equivalent\neducation: ( 2) at least two years ' successful experience in school work; (\n3) two references who can vouch for moral and personal habits; ( 4) a\nsatisfactory examination in arithmetic, political and physical geography,\nAmerican history and government, general history and current topics,\ndictation and grammar, physiology and hygiene, algebra, school methods and\nmanagement; ( 5) a physician 's certificate of good health; and ( 6) a\ncontract to serve two years, and to accept whatever location may be assigned.\n\n\n \n\nThe Thomasites were no doubt a well-screened group.\n\n\nAs reported by Muerman ( 1992:42), over 85% of them were either\nuniversity, college or normal school graduates.\n\n\nOne-fifth were graduates with no experience, three-fifths had from\none to seven years ' experience, and one-fifth had more than seven years of\nexperience.\n\n\nOne hundred fifty had A.B. degrees and had a B.S. from reputable\ninstitutions of learning.\n\n\nMuerman further reports that 21 wrote 'm.A.' after their names and\n31, the B.L. degree.\n\n\nThree had earned Ph.D. degrees, 25, Ph.B., and 118 had graduated from\nAmerican schools.\n\n\nWith respect to education and experience, then, the Thomasites were\nthe finest trained body of teachers America had ever tried to send from its\nterritory. \n\n \n\nIt is interesting to note that the Thomasites arrived in the\nPhilippines on August 21, 1901, a time when Filipino-American hostilities\nwere still intense.\n\n\nBefore long, they had to face threats of dying from tropical diseases\nsuch as cholera, dysentery, and smallpox.\n\n\nStuntz ( 1904:194) attempts a moving account of the situation many\nThomasites found themselves in:  \n\n \n\nThe circumstances under which the Thomasites worked were indeed\nvery difficult, but their youthful idealism and perhaps missionary spirit\nmade them persist and survive. \n\n\n  The Soldier-Teachers: The Thomasites ' Precursors \n\n\n \n\nEven before the Thomasites came, there were already Americans who\nhad been teaching English in the country.\n\n\nThese were actually soldiers who doubled as English teachers.\n\n\nThis situation came about after the American military authorities\nrealized that the schools appeared to be effective instruments in convincing\nFilipinos of the noble objectives of the new colonizers. \n\n \n\nWithin three weeks after Manila was occupied by the American\nforces on August 13, 1898, seven schools were reopened and a teacher of\nEnglish was assigned to each of these schools under army jurisdiction.\n\n\nInterestingly, the public schools of the country were operated by the\narmy for a period of more than two years.\n\n\nIn fact, one of the first military acts after the occupancy of a town\nor village was the establishment of the public school, frequently with an\nAmerican soldier detailed as teacher.\n\n\nAlthough there was little permanent school organization in this\nsituation, its moral effect was very strong ( Foreman 1917:13). \n\n \n\nA popular Catholic priest, Fr. W. D. Mckinnon, who served as\nchaplain of the First California Regiment, supervised the first Manila\nschools under American control.\n\n\nIn June 1899, Lt. George P. Anderson was designated City\nSuperintendent of Schools for the Philippine Islands.\n\n\nIn May, 1990, Dr. Fred Atkinson took over the work from Capt. Todd,\nthe former having been designated as General Superintendent of Public\nInstruction by the Philippine Commission.\n\n\nIn the meantime, the military officers and enlisted men continued\nwith their school assignments even as superintendents and teachers began to\narrive from the United States during the first year of Dr. Atkinson 's\nadministration. \n\n \n\nDespite their unpreparedness to conduct classes and the unsettled\nsituation at the time, a good number of the American soldiers did\nsurprisingly well.\n\n\nA report made by Gen. William A. Kobbe to the Adjutant General,\nDivision of the Philippines on Mindanao and Jolo, carries the following\naccount ( MacArthur 1990:18).  \n\n \n\nA Thomasite himself, Muerman ( 1922:25) pays tribute to the\nsoldier-teachers in the following words.  \n\n \n\nThe main problem, explains Muerman, was that the soldier-teacher\nwas not regular in his attendance and the military companies were almost\nconstantly on the move.\n\n\nStill and all, Muerman believes that the soldier teachers did the\nbest they could and paved the way for something more permanent.\n\n\nWithout doubt, the soldier-teachers played a significant role in the\nacceptance and success of the civilian Thomasites who were to take over the\ninstructional work. \n\n\n  The Thomasite as Teacher of Teachers: Reviewing the Forms\nof Teacher Training  \n\n \n\nWhat should perhaps be kept in mind is that the Thomasite was\ncharged with the task of teaching or training the local teachers, both actual\nand prospective ( the name given to the latter was   \"\naspirantes \"   - - teaching aspirants or aspiring\nteachers).\n\n\nIn almost all school divisions, every Thomasite was obliged to devote\nat least an hour daily to the instruction of the Filipino teacher in English\nand in methods of teaching.\n\n\nHis presence was, therefore, a feature of practically all forms of\nteacher training - - vacation assemblies, summer schools, normal institutes,\netc. \n\n \n\nTeacher training then was either  regular  or \nspecial  .\n\n\nUnder the regular type may be placed the training given at the\nManila, later Philippine, Normal School and the provincial counterparts (\ne.g. Cebu, Iloilo, Ilocos Norte) and the training given in the course for\nteaching offered in the intermediate schools.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the special type of teacher training included the\nconduct of vacation assemblies, division normal institutes, model or\ndemonstration classes, supervision, and teachers ' meetings. \n\n The   pensionado   system, which was\nofficially established by the General Superintendent of Education through a\ncircular he issued on March 3, 1904, may be added to the list of regular\nforms of teacher training.\n\n\nThis actually consisted of sending a few qualified teachers to the\nUnited States or to the Philippine Normal School for further training along\nspecial lines.\n\n\nThe   pensionados   were to work either\nfor a certificate, a bachelor 's degree, or a graduate degree. \n\n \n\nIn the early years of existence of the Philippine Normal School,\nthe majority, if not all, of the faculty members were expectedly Thomasites.\n\n\nThis was also true of the provincial normal schools.\n\n\nAn attempt to upgrade the academic qualifications of local teachers\nwas the offering of a course in teaching on the secondary level.\n\n\nThis covered only two years in the provincial school, after which any\nstudent who completed its requirements and who wished to receive further\ntraining in teaching would qualify for admission to the Philippine Normal\nSchool ( PNS).\n\n\nThe final instruction at PNS also required two years. \n\n \n\nBaguio and Manila were invariably chosen as sites for vacation\nassemblies.\n\n\nWhile the Baguio assembly, which was started in 1908, consisted\nlargely of conferences, lectures, and classes for supervisors and teachers of\nhigher professional attainments, the Manila assembly took care of classes in\ninstructional methods designed for teachers of lower professional\nattainments. \n\n \n\nSummer schools were set up in a number of school divisions as a\nmeans of improving both the academic and professional qualifications of the\n  aspirantes   or prospective teachers who had\ncompleted only the intermediate grades or who had completed only one or more\nyears of the secondary course.\n\n\nNormal institutes, on the other hand, were held in almost all school\ndivisions at the beginning of the school year in order to provide a few weeks\nof intensive training and motivation to elementary school teachers - -\nespecially to the new recruits among them - - just before their work for the\nyear began.\n\n\nAs a rule, teachers who had been trained in vacation assemblies\nserved as instructors, in the normal institutes. \n\n \n\nIn addition to the daily instruction given by the resident\nAmerican teacher, the teachers of each province or school division were\ngathered together at least once a year for a period of around four to eight\nweeks in a normal institute which was first conducted in Manila in April and\nMay of 1901.\n\n\nAn interesting feature of the normal institute was that even the\nsimplest matters of class and school organization had to be explained and\nillustrated to the teacher participants.\n\n\nThe method of presenting the subject, teaching with the use of\nobjects ( or things), the conduct of English conversations, etc. were\nexplained with extreme care and the teachers drilled on these methods.\n\n\nAn instructive account is given by the Superintendent of the Division\nof Ilocos Norte, J.M. Knisely, in relation to the manner in which the normal\ninstitute was held in his division ( General Superintendent of Education\n1903:755).  \n\n \n\nAnother superintendent of schools, this time of the Division of\nPampanga and Bataan, William A. Preuitt, describes how the normal institutes\nin his division were conducted.  \n\n \n\nAll the positive comments on the normal institute may be\nsummarized in the following words from the principal of a Vigan school,\nCharles K. Bliss.  \n\n \n\nDemonstration or model classes using actual pupils or students\nwere also conducted to give the teachers a clear, concrete picture of how\nthey could teach a lesson effectively.\n\n\nThese classes, which were held in a number of municipalities and in\nmany of the supervising districts of the country, were observed by many\nteachers who would then discuss the work of the model teachers.\n\n\nIn normal schools, the 'critic-teacher 's class' was always an\nimportant component, the observation teachers always expected to absorb the 'effective'\nmethods employed by the critic teacher.\n\n\nEven the Thomasites themselves had to observe one another 's classes.\n\n\nFor instance, the superintendent of the Division of Ilocos Sur and\nAbra, G.A. O' Reilley, gives the following report with regard to the holding\nof demonstration classes in a normal institute conducted in his division\nwhich had a good supply of American teachers.  \n\n \n\nSupervision was perhaps taken very seriously during the\nThomasites ' time.\n\n\nThe supervisor 's task was not just mere inspection but making sure\nthe teachers knew what they were expected to do.\n\n\nDespite some fear, the teachers were generally willing to learn from\nany supervisor.\n\n\nIn most cases, the Filipino teacher taught one week what he himself\nhad learned the previous week.\n\n\nAs a result, he had to be constantly assisted, supervised and\ninstructed by the American teacher. \n\n \n\nIn the field, the supervisory force consisted of division\nsuperintendents, division supervisors, supervising teachers and principals of\nschools ( Director of Education 1924:14).\n\n\nIn spite of the administrative nature of the division superintendent 's\nposition, this official spent considerable time in the classrooms, usually\nwith teachers in isolated barrio schools.\n\n\nTogether with the academic supervisor, the industrial supervisor and,\nin some divisions, the supervisor of health and hygiene, he was able to give\neach teacher in his jurisdiction helpful supervision several times in a\nschool year.\n\n\nEach division superintendent of a province had charge over\nsupervising teachers who attended to matters of school administration in\ncertain municipalities and supervised the work of teachers in a specific\nsection of the province. \n\n \n\nSupervisors of academic work were appointed in seven divisions.\n\n\nIn Manila, there were three such officers among whom the work was\ndivided on a grade basis.\n\n\nThe main task of these supervisors was to improve the quality of\ninstruction by personal conferences, observation and discussion of model\nlessons, exhibits of school work, tasks of class work, etc. ( Director of\nEducation 1914:70).\n\n\nIn a few divisions, the tendency was to relieve the division\nsuperintendent of various routine duties by transferring them to the academic\nsupervisor who was much later considered an indispensable component of the\nsupervisory scheme. \n\n \n\nMeetings and conferences also played an important role in the\ntraining and retraining of teachers.\n\n\nAt first, even unimportant matters such as the arrangement of the\nteacher 's table were discussed in teachers ' meetings, but the need to zero\nin on effective teaching methods was eventually seen by those attending the\nmeetings. \n\n\n  The Thomasite as a Methods-oriented Teacher  \n\n \n\nIf there was one thing the Thomasite could not keep his eyes off,\nit was how to teach English effectively.\n\n\nHe was frequently, if not always, concerned with ways or methods\nwhich would bring results.\n\n\nThe buzzword in his time could have aptly been \" 'methods,\nmethods, methods' \" . \n\n \n\nThe first few years of the Thomasite period were, understandably\nenough, the 'trial-and error' years.\n\n\nThe Thomasite was given almost unlimited freedom to try any method\nwhich he thought would work with his students.\n\n\nNo course of study had to be followed; no 'appropriate' textbook\ncould be used.\n\n\nOne Thomasite ( Muerman 1922:56) recalls that when he asked the\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction to give him some suggestions for a\ncourse of study, the reply was,  Go out into your province, make your\nown course of study and adapt it to the conditions which surround you\n .\n\n\nWhat or how the Thomasites taught did not have to follow the\ntraditional lines they were so familiar with in the Unites States.\n\n\nA few of them, however, tried the tips or suggestions given by one\nor two soldier-teachers who had remained in the service. \n\n \n\nThe instruction earlier given by the soldier-teacher had a\nconsiderable oral component ( MacArthur 1900:18), but it could have been a\nless methodical version of the 'object-action' method which later became\npopular among the Thomasites.\n\n\nThis method actually sought to make the student acquire some basic\nvocabulary by introducing to them objects, either actual or in pictures, and\ngiving them names.\n\n\nThe objects would then be given action ( or verbs) and even\ndescription ( or adjectives).\n\n\nFreer, as paraphrased by Lardizabal ( 1956:152), offers a clearer\ndescription of how this method was employed.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a126b33e-dfe8-4699-930f-0692e2f18a4d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.168209+00:00"}
{"text": "DALAWANG DULA NI CLARISSA SA ECOLOHIYA  :\nECOLOGY AS LITERATURE AS COUNTER IDEOLOGICAL DISCOURSE  \n\n\n Paz Verdades M. Santos \n\n \n\nIn the book  Science and Literature  , Matthew Arnold\nwarns against a fictional educator who is likely to say  \" he\nwho in his training has substituted literature and history for natural\nscience has chosen the less useful alternative &rdquo;  ( Cadden and\nBrownstown 1964:23). \n\n \n\nOne Bikol woman writer who is also a biology professor has\nsacrificed neither field of study for the other as \" less useful.\n&rdquo;\n\n\nIn fact, she has packaged many of her science lessons in the literary\ngenre of drama.\n\n\nThis playwright is Clarissa Guadalupe a.k.a. Emelina Gagalac Regis,\n1992 Palanca awardee for  \" Dalawang Mukha ng Kagubatan \n, &rdquo; one of two plays in   Dalawang Dula ni Clarissa sa\nEkolohiya   ( 1993). \n\n \n\nRegis, associate professor of more than two decades at the Ateneo\nde Naga, has a B.S. in Botany and an M.S. in Biology from U.P. and is\npresently working on her Ph.D. in Biology at the same university.\n\n\nIt may come as a surprise to find out that this playwright has had no\nother background or training in literature except for the usual courses in\nhigh school and college.\n\n\nBut as science professor, founder of ecological groups, and much\nsought after speaker on environmentalism, she has long been a dedicated\nsteward of the world.\n\n\nShe wrote \"  Karagatan  &rdquo; in 1988 and\n\"  Dalawang Mukha ng Kagubatan  &rdquo; in 1990, as\ncontest pieces for the student group she moderated and for her outreach\nenvironmental campaigns.\n\n\nSince she could not find an environmental play, she decided to write\none, adapting the concept of an  Ynang Bayan  in the \nzarzuela    Kahapon, Ngayon at Bukas   into\nan  Inang Kalikasan  .\n\n\nRegis did not give literary contests a thought when she wrote her\nplays.\n\n\nBut a former student who had won a national award for poetry read\n\"  Karagatan  &rdquo; and convinced her to send in her\nwork.\n\n\nShe submitted \"  Dalawang Mukha  , &rdquo; which\nwas more polished because it had been presented several times.\n\n\nIt also has a less provocative ending than \"  Karagatan\n , &rdquo; which ends with a mass action.\n\n\nA few months later, Regis was planning Environmental Week activities\nwhen a telegram arrived, informing her that she had won one of the two first\nprizes for the Palanca for one-act play in Filipino.\n\n\nSince then, she has written two more environmental and one historical\nplay. \n\n \n\nBut why a critique on an almost unknown writer \" out in the\nsticks\"? \n\n \n\nFirst, literary critic Soledad C. Reyes states that  the\nhitherto neglected regional literature will have to be considered more\nseriously before the label  \" Philippine Literature \"\n can assume a more valid meaning as a concept that encompasses not only\nliterature in Tagalog-speaking regions and/or Philippine Literature in\nEnglish, but the works produced outside the cities.  ( Reyes 1987:72)\n\n\n \n\nSecond, Patajo-Legasto ( 1993) calls for \"\nreterritorialization &rdquo; of Philippine literary studies  \"\nto capture spaces for marginalized literatures &rdquo;  ( 51). \n\n \n\nThis reading of Regis 's plays is a response to Reyes 's\ncriticism and Patajo-Legasto 's call for the study of marginalized\nliteratures toward a more encompassing body of literary criticism.\n\n\nThe plays are written by a member of the marginalized sex ( female)\nin the periphery ( the countryside) of a marginalized country ( the\nPhilippines); they also center around a much maligned section ( the \nkaingeros  and fisherfolk) of an already marginalized sector of\nsociety ( the rural poor).\n\n\nFurther, these plays are excellent literary works, as attested to by\na Palanca, but they most likely will not make it to the Philippine literary\ncanon.\n\n\nThey are therefore appropriate for a post-colonial critique in the\ndecolonizing Philippine society. \n\n\n   DALAWANG DULA SA ECOLOHIYA   \n\n \"  Karagatan  &rdquo; is about a big problem in San\nMiguel Bay, Camarines Sur.\n\n\nElpidio owns big trawls which use dynamite and  muro-ami\n to literally rake the fish from the sea.\n\n\nHe sells these at superprofits to Mr. Yen.\n\n\nThe small fishing community, among them the family of Karding and\nDesta, are therefore left with hardly any fish.\n\n\nKarding 's son Juanito, a college student, reports Elpidio to the\ngovernment.\n\n\nMeanwhile, when the fishermen brave the deeper waters at night in\nsearch of fish, Karding is killed in a storm.\n\n\nThe worst is not over, for Elpidio 's goons kill Juanito 's brother\nwhen they learn about Juanito 's action.\n\n\nThe fisherfolk revolt against the trawler 's men, and their action\nmoves all the fishing communities in the land to protest their plight.\n\n\nThis in turn pushes the government to pass a law to protect the small\nfisherfolk. \n\n \n\n\"  Dalawang Mukha ng Kagubatan  &rdquo; has\na similar plot, except that the setting is the forest, and the conflict is\nunresolved.\n\n\nBerto and Julian are conscripted by Engineer Ramos to cut logs, which\nRamos in turn sells to Mr. Yen.\n\n\nJulian dies when the branches of a tree they are cutting falls on\nhim.\n\n\nThe insensitive Engineer demands more wood, while Berto 's son Jun,\nwho is graduating from college, warns his father about the ecological\ndisasters logging brings.\n\n\nHis Lolo Doro, a farmer, takes his part, but Berto and Ana see no\nother way to earn a living.\n\n\nAt the end of the play, Jun is killed when a tree falls on him during\na strong typhoon. \n\n\n  LITERATURE FROM THE MARGINS  \n\n \n\nPatajo-Legasto defines post-colonial writings as  those\nthat articulate the oppositional/interventionary as well as re-defined\nconsciousness of peoples whose identities have been fragmented, whose\ncultures have been deracinated by the physical and epistemic violence of\nimperialist incursions and colonialist systems of knowledge  . (\nPantoja-Hidalgo and Patajo-Legasto 1993:6) \n\n \n\nShe further outlines the two characteristics of post-colonial\ndiscourse.\n\n\nFirst, it critiques Western hegemony, the assumptions of which have\npenetrated into mass consciousness to legitimize colonialism and \n\" to marginalize the cultural productions/knowledges of colonials and\nformer colonials &rdquo;  ( 7).\n\n\nSecond, it articulates \" alternative practices &rdquo; which\ninclude the forgotten or \" minority &rdquo; texts as well as currently\nproduced texts which confront the effects of, among others,  \"\nthe uneven development of interlocking economic, political and cultural,\nincluding aesthetic, modes of production &rdquo;  ( 7). \n\n \n\nMabilangan also refers to post-colonial literature when she\nstates that \" emergent literature &rdquo; has been dismissed because of\ntheir didacticism which according to the dominant canon  \"\ndetracts from the 'beauty' of the written text &rdquo;  (\nPantoja-Hidalgo and Patajo-Legasto, 1993:66).\n\n\nFor example, formalists may find that the plays of Regis lack \"\ntextual virtuosity &rdquo; because of their \" simple &rdquo; characters\nand plots.\n\n\nBut as Mabilangan further states,  Emergent literature demands\na new set of rules for it has broken the old set.\n\n\nTherefore, for us to understand emergent literature, we need to learn\nhow to read again.  ( 66) \n\n \n\nI will read Regis 's texts by experimenting with such \n\" a new set of rules,\"  one that deals with environmentalism as\ndiscourse and as literature. \n\n\n  ENVIRONMENTALISM AS TWO-FACED DISCOURSE  \n\n \n\nIn an article entitled \" \" In the service of two\ngods: deconstructing environmentalism as a two-faced discourse, &rdquo;\n\" Contreras ( 1992) states:  \" Discourse on\nenvironmental protection is a political terrain that has to be fought not\nonly in terms of people against the forces of ecological destruction, but\nalso in terms of battles between classes, genders, and races of people.\n&rdquo;  ( 13) \n\n \n\nContreras further claims that environmentalism can be and has\nbeen used as an instrument by those in power for its own ends - - whether it\nbe its development agenda, or an imperialist, white racist, male-dominated\ncolonizing world.\n\n\nAt the same time, he points out that environmentalism can be used by\nthe oppressed classes to challenge the dominant ideology.\n\n\nThus, the two faces of environmentalism - -  \" the\nhegemony maintaining face, and the counter-hegemony building face &rdquo;\n ( 15).\n\n\nTo become a radical counterdiscourse, Contreras says that\nenvironmentalists should  challenge the current social arrangements -\n- the modes of production, consumption and constitution which provide cause\nand reason for ecological disasters... by providing an avenue for the\noppressed to constitute their own languages and practices which could later\npave a way for their withdrawal from the consensual relations of domination\nin which they have been invested.  ( 15) \n\n \n\nFurther, Contreras says that environmentalism should be imbued\nwith a counterideology and struggle against the structures of oppression.\n\n\nHe points out the new counterideology as deep ecology, socialist\necology, indigenous ecology, and eco-feminism, all of which indict present\nstructures. \n\n \n\nWhile Contreras 's theory is not exactly on literature, his\nconstant references to \" \" discourse, &rdquo; \"\ndefined as  \" ways in which meanings are constructed, &rdquo;\n ( Pantoja-Hidalgo and Patajo-Legasto 1993:42) tie up the\nenvironmentalist concerns of Regis 's plays with issues tackled in recent\nliterary theorizing.\n\n\nLiterature is one form of discourse wed in the text of Regis.\n\n\nContreras 's references to class, gender, and race, and to \"\ndeconstruction &rdquo; also show the common concerns of environmental and\nliterary discourse in a post-colonial context. \n\n\n  REGIS 's ENVIRONMENTALISM  \n\n \n\nThe texts contend with the forces which bring ecological\ndestruction - - the greed of Ramos, Elpidio ( spelled out in the surname\n\"  Maramot  \" ) and Mr. Yen, the propensity\nfor materialism and conspicuous consumption, as well as the needs of the\nforest and fisherfolk.\n\n\nBut in confronting the causes of environmental degradation, do the\nplays take up cudgels regarding issues of \" gender, class and race\n&rdquo; necessary for environmentalism 's \" counterhegemony building\nface\"? \n\n \n\nTo take the first of these issues, Regis 's texts evidently carry\nno feminist sensibility.\n\n\nThough there are women characters, they play supporting roles in both\nplays; the human protagonists are young males, Juanito in \" \nKaragatan  &rdquo; and Jun in \"  Dalawang Mukha  .\n&rdquo; It may be pointed out that in \"  Dalawang Mukha\n</indig , &rdquo; nature is troped as a w oman and death as a man, but these\nare traditional conventions rather than any conscious uplifting of the status\nof woman.\n\n\nAna, the only female human in this play, is not a very likeable\ncharacter as compared with the wise grandfather or her idealistic son.\n\n\nShe is painted as the conspicuous consumer who pushes her husband to\ncut more trees so that they can have a feast for Jun 's graduation.\n\n\nWhen her son reminds her,     Pero huwag na sana\nkayong mag-abala pang maghanda.\n\n\nMahirap lang naman tayo   ,   Ana\nconfidently says,     Kaya ka naming ipaghanda.\n\n\nMaraming kahoy sa bundok  ,    ( Regis\n1993:57) revealing the stereotype of the \"  \" Bilmoko\n\"  &rdquo; woman who thinks only of short-term luxuries.\n\n\nIn \"  Karagatan  , &rdquo; Desta is the\n  mater dolorosa   who serves her menfolk and\ngrieves over the corpses of husband and son.\n\n\nWhen other female characters speak, it is in the form of traditional\n\" woman 's talk, &rdquo; a form of non-speech and background static of\nbackground noises and gossip which do nothing to articulate women 's\nconcerns.\n\n\nIn fact, the neighboring women in \"  Karagatan \n&rdquo; are gossips who, while providing background information on Elpidio,\nare judgmental of other women:  \n\n \n\nPatriarchal conjugal relations are not questioned either in both\nplays; the husband goes off to work and the mother stays home to keep house,\nhiding the reality that women participate in productive activities in these\nrural households.\n\n\nFinally, the priority given to the son instead of the daughter in\nterms of education is not questioned, only the poverty that prevents the\ndaughter from going to school. \n\n \n\nThis concern with poverty leads to the second issue of class\nstruggle, and Regis 's position on this is clearer.\n\n\nNeither Berto 's nor Karding 's family has ever had access to\ndevelopment or even social equity, which is why Mida, Andoy, and Berto\nharvest the sea of its coral and the forest of its trees.\n\n\nThe text questions the present social arrangements, as in Ana 's\nexplanation to Jun about why they cut trees for a living:  \n\n \n\nThe land problem, one of the root causes of poverty in the\nPhilippines, is revealed as also being one cause of environmental degradation\nin this country.\n\n\nFew  hacenderos  own hundreds of hectares of land\nand many are squatters in their own country, forcing some of them to be\n  kaingineros   . \n\n \n\nA kind of class consciousness may be seen too in the comments of\n Lolo  Doro about the insensitivity of Engineer Ramos,  . \n\n \n\nThis not-too-veiled criticism of bureaucrats ( is her use of the\nTop Bureaucrat 's name coincidental?) and bureaucrat capitalism is more\nstraightforward in \"  Karagatan  &rdquo; when Karding\ncomments     Parang walang magawa ang mga pulis at\nnamamahalang kawanihan dito     ( 6) and Kikoy says:\n \n\n \n\nClass consciousness is also evident when Karding reflects, \n   Kung minsan naiisip ko tuloy, ang mundo ba ay para sa\nmga mayayaman lamang   ?   ( 6) \n\n \n\nAs to questions of race and colonization, Regis chooses to\ncritique the new imperialists and the \" new collaborators, &rdquo;\nrather than the overstaying American neo-colonialists or their \" little\nbrown American &rdquo; cohorts.\n\n\nJapan is satirized in Mr. Yen, while the modern-day  Makapilis\n are exposed through Doro 's mockery of Engineer Ramos 's greed and\ninsensitivity, and through Juanito 's accusation of Elpidio:  \n\n \n\nTo summarize, Regis attacks the unequal social arrangements, the\npolitical economy which fosters these, and neo-colonialism of the Japanese\nkind, but does not question the traditional roles of women in a feudal and\npatriarchal society.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a076fa8e-b6d6-4d56-93e2-6ed9bdd080c9", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.169853+00:00"}
{"text": "The Contribution of Religious Studies at DLSU to National\nDevelopment  \n\n\n Jaime Belita, CM \n\n \n\nAs the Philippines makes the journey to the new millennium, the\nnational leadership has three goals clearly in mind: poverty reduction, job\ncreation, and economic growth.\n\n\nThis much publicized  \" medium-term development plan\n\"  is the centerpiece of the Ramos administration.\n\n\nTo achieve his goals, Ramos invokes \" synergistic factors\n&rdquo; like \" people 's confidence &rdquo; in his administration and\ncloser ties with our ASEAN neighbors.\n\n\nThere are other synergistic factors that are intended to help achieve\na holistic development, like the Moral Recovery Program and the Values\nEducation program of the Department of Education, Culture and Sports ( DECS).\n\n\n \n\nSenator Leticia Ramos Shahani came up with the idea of a \nMoral Recovery Program: Building a Nation, Inspiring our People to Action\n , institutionalized later by the Ramos administration through DECS.\n\n\nThe Philippine Institute for Alternative Futures designed a workshop\nmodule for facilitators named  \" Wholeness: A Values\nTransformation Program for Moral Recovery \"  .\n\n\nShahani 's speeches on the moral recovery have been compiled in a\nbooklet,  Moral Imperatives of National Renewal  .\n\n\nPresident Ramos, her brother, later gave a directive that encouraged\nall sectors of society to give this moral recovery program a good fighting\nchance.\n\n\nBoth DECS and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (\nDILG) are taking active part in its dissemination. \n\n \n\nDECS has formulated its own Values Education Program ( DVEP),\ninitiated by former DECS Secretary, Lourdes Quisumbing, in DECS Order no. 6\ns. 1988, addressed to DECS Regional Directors and School Heads, both public\nand private.\n\n\nAccording to the order,  \" to participate in social\ntransformation and nation building &rdquo;  is expected from the\ncitizenry, but first there has to be  \" a corresponding\nreassessment in the values, the attitudes and the behavior of the people.\n&rdquo; \n\n\nThe DECS order also states in no uncertain terms that  \"\nthe enhancement of social responsibility, initiative and resourcefulness must\nbe internalized first by those involved in the transformation process\nthemselves, for transformation should start from the 'actors' themselves.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThe government thus admitted the crucial role and participation\nof the religious sector in the Moral Recovery Program.\n\n\nUnderstood here is religion 's role in national development with its\ninfluence channeled through the Churches.\n\n\nShahani 's paper says:  \" Religious has an important\nrole in molding our values and it should be a partner of government in this\nimportant undertaking. &rdquo; \n\n\nOne institutionalized response to such an appeal is from the Catholic\nChurch through the Second Plenary Council of the Philippines ( PCP-II), held\nin Manila from January 20 to February 17, 1991. \n\n \n\nThe Plenary Council implied that for the Church in the\nPhilippines, national development would have to include  \"\ntruths, needing emphasis today for the development of the just life and of\nthe just society which serves that life; integral development based on human\ndignity and solidarity; universal purpose of earthly goods and private\nproperty; social justice and love; peace and active non-violence; love or\npreference for the poor; the value of human work; the integrity of creation;\nthe empowerment of people &rdquo;  ( PCP-II, 291).\n\n\nThe neglect of or lack of one of these will leave national\ndevelopment with much to be desired. \n\n \n\nThe consensus of both Church and government on the significant\nrole of values education for national development is conclusive.\n\n\nEducational institutions which have both governmental and\necclesiastical recognition are the best venues for the implementation of such\n\" synergistic &rdquo; enterprise. \n\n \n\nThis leads me to my discussion of the contribution of DLSU to\nnational development in the last eight years ( 1986-94) and what it can do in\nthe next seven years ( 1995-2001), as far as the university 's religious\nstudies and religious education 's programs and policies are concerned.\n\n\nTo say that the Religious Studies Department ( RSD) is making a\ndirect contribution would be presumptuous; only because religion, Church, and\na Catholic university make an impact on the public in moral and social\nmatters can we claim an indirect contribution. \n\n\n 1.  The Immediate Past ( 1986-1994)  \n\n \n\nWhat have RSD and the Religious and Values Education Program (\nRVEP) done in the last eight years?\n\n\nI shall discuss the more salient areas: the offering of religious\nstudies instead of theology, the revision of religion subjects in keeping\nwith the directives of the National Catechetical Directory of the Philippines\n( NCDP, 1985), and the establishment of a Religious and Values Education\ndegree in the College of Education in 1987. \n\n\n 1.1.  Opting for Religious Studies and not Theology \n\n\n \n\nTheology focuses on the confessional and doctrinal content of the\nfaith, Religious Studies on the anthropological and the phenomenological.\n\n\nReligious Studies is inseparable from the Christian faith 's seeking\nunderstanding for a \" fundamental commitment &rdquo; to the human\nperson.\n\n\nHuman reason helps in that search.\n\n\nThe university is the institution where that  \" effort\nto reach the most accurate understanding of man and the world finds, as it\nwere, its most concentrated form &rdquo;  ( Massaux 1980:215).\n\n\nValues education, which is the heart of education, is made explicit\nin the stories, doctrines, and moral norms that constitute the materials of\nReligious Studies, covering not only Christianity but other faiths as well.\n\n\nHence, the Religious Studies program fits in better with a\npluralistic society. \n\n \n\nAn academic approach to religion which is open to other faiths\nhelps remove the often divisive role of religion that obstructs national\ndevelopment.\n\n\nHow is this accomplished?\n\n\nFirst of all, the phenomenological approach to religion allows every\nfaith to be affirmed freely and authentically; secondly, the openness to the\nother and the respect for human reason are the ingredients that concoct a\n \" consensus sufficiently strong enough to prevent differences\nfrom becoming disruptive &rdquo;  ( Massaux 220).\n\n\nSuch atmosphere initiated in the Religious Studies approach is\nnecessary in a \" democratic and pluralistic collectivity. &rdquo;\nWithout sounding superior or self-righteous, we can say this about today 's\ntypical Catholic theologians: because of their cognizance of human reason and\ntheir avoidance of exclusivistic bible-based theologizing ( associated \n in extremis   with fundamentalists), they can easily\ndialogue with those who are \" equally reasonable. &rdquo; \n\n\nh> 1.2.  Revision of Religion Subjects  \n\n \n\nThe NCDP influenced the revision of the religion subjects at\nDLSU.\n\n\nBasically, the Directory calls for \" maturing in Christian\nfaith &rdquo; in any catechetical, religious, or values education programs of\nschools and local Churches.\n\n\nIn the teaching of religion or theology, NCDP considers four areas\nfor renewal: characteristics, purpose, content, and methodology ( Roche\n1992:11-18).\n\n\nThese four areas have multiple components, mostly on the religious,\ntheological, and ecclesiastical side.\n\n\nFortunately, however, it has components as well that touch on\nnational development, since they deal with social, economic, and cultural\nmatters. \n\n \n\nOf direct relevance to national development are the\ncharacteristics of  Filipino  and  social concern and service to\nthe larger community  .\n\n\nA Filipino religion course means that there is an effort at\ninculturated, contextualized education through the offering of courses in\nFilipino and regarding Filipino values.\n\n\nThe social concern and service to the larger community are realized\nby following the Social Doctrine of the Church and the Acts and Decrees of\nPCP-II.\n\n\nRSD has continually created sections where Filipino is the medium of\ninstruction.\n\n\nIntegrated into religion courses are required activities like\nimmersions, exposure trips, and tutorial jobs for abandoned or neglected\nchildren.\n\n\nIn 1991 on the occasion of the centenary of Leo XIII 's encyclical,\n  Rerum Novarum   , RSD had a series of talks on\nthe social teachings of the Church, centered primarily on John Paul II 's\n  Centessimus Annus  : Encyclical Letter on the\nAnniversary of  Rerum Novarum   ( 1991).\n\n \n\nNDCP inspired RSD to have a new purpose:  transformation\n .\n\n\nIn a more religious context, it is called  \" conversion\n\"  .\n\n\nPCP-II adds a qualifier through the phrase  \" social\ntransformation \"  .\n\n\nRSD complemented its course on Church and Sacraments by setting up as\nprerequisite a two-day retreat called the  PAGKAMULAT \nRetreat, meant to make students more aware of the social dimension of faith.\n\n\nThe  PAGKAMULAT  Retreat departs from traditional\nretreats or recollections in that it includes nationalism and social\nconsciousness as values processed and inculcated in the activities. \n\n \n\nThe content of religion was updated through the introduction of\nsocial consciousness in the courses.\n\n\nTwo subjects that have direct bearing on the issue are CODEVEL (\nTheology of Liberation and Development) and BUSIETH ( Ethics in the Business\nWorld).\n\n\nDrawing from the same social teachings of the Church, these courses\ncomplement each other.\n\n\nCODEVEL, which uses a spiritual approach to development based on the\nsocial doctrines of the Church, infuses social dimension into BUSIETH.\n\n\nBUSIETH, on the other hand, provides CODEVEL with analytical methods\nto see the structures in the business world and their corresponding\nrelationships.\n\n\nThe social doctrines of the Church see to it that religion is not\nrelegated to the private sphere; analytical methods make sure that religion 's\nrole in national development is not merely to moralize but to make judgments\nbased on facts and reality. \n\n \n\nMethodology was updated, and one of the newer methods is\ninculturation.\n\n\nUnfortunately, inculturation has been narrowly limited to a\nsuperficial use of living and dead folklore and symbols.\n\n\nAn indicator that a symbol is already dead and dysfunctional is that\nan activity surrounding it merely becomes a spectacle needing so many\nexplanations for people to understand.\n\n\nFortunately, today 's religion teachers have gone beyond gimmickry\nand forced symbolization in recognition that modern Filipinos are aware and\nhave adopted other cultural elements.\n\n\nWe would rather go for Roche 's description of authentic\ninculturation: it is by  \" exercising students in seeing the\nChristian message and values in their daily Filipino lives, and educating\nthem toward practicing these truths and values in their Filipino culture\n&rdquo;  ( Roche 1992:17). \n\n \n\nWe are aware of the DVEP.\n\n\nIt is a good attempt to bring about a more holistic approach to\neducation even in public schools.\n\n\nAlthough we cannot expect DVEP to come up with religion or\nChurch-based values to disseminate like those in NCDP or PCP-II, yet in the\nfield of social responsibility and family life there are a lot of\nparallelisms.\n\n\nA cursory look at the DVEP framework fixes our eyes on \" the\nhuman person &rdquo; and \" human dignity &rdquo; as the foundations of\n\" core and related values. &rdquo;\n\n\nThe undergraduate religious program at DLSU reinforces and provides\ncontinuity with the DECS Secondary Education Development Program ( SEDP) 's\nvalues education program in high school. \n\n\n 1.3.  Establishing a Graduate Religious Studies Program \n\n\n \n\nValues education is the heart of education.\n\n\nThis is the rationale behind the Graduate Religious Studies program.\n\n\nSome educators think that the DVEP seems to be just a glorified\n\" Good Manners and Right Conduct &rdquo; course that was traditionally\ntaken by elementary and high school students ( Ulgado 1992:20).\n\n\nAt times, too, a values formation exercise in public schools and\nother government institutions is really just a non-denominational version of\nthe \" Life in the Spirit &rdquo; seminar, replete with spontaneous\nprayers and sharing of testimonies.\n\n\nThe DLSU College of Education ( CED) believes that there is a need\nfor programs for the education of religion teachers that are based on sound\npsychology and philosophy of education. \n\n \n\nPart of a solution to the need is the strengthening of the\nempirical component of research in Religious Education.\n\n\nProgram evaluation and multi-year planning become indispensable tools\nfor improving programs.\n\n\nGraduate study should include not only the students ' religious\nknowledge and attitudes but also parents ' educational and economic status\nand the general status of the environment ( Belita 1986:201).\n\n\nAn instrument that has been commonly used is that of Fr. Luke\nMoortgat 's Philippine Attitudes Scale and Knowledge Orientation ( \nPASKO  ) .\n\n\nIn a questionnaire like  PASKO  , aside from\ntraditional questions regarding dogma, are statements regarding the poor,\nsocial justice, and other related social issues. \n\n \n\nGraduate students have to take educational subjects which include\nstatistics and research methodology.\n\n\nLest content be sacrificed, theological subjects are taught by\nprofessional theologians teaching in RSD.\n\n\nRSD and the graduate education program share faculty.\n\n\nAn indication that a religious program has departed from the\ntraditional one is that more than half of the instructors are lay people and\nthe takers are half religious and half lay. \n\n \n\nA method made popular by liberation theology and recent Filipino\nChurch documents like pastoral letters and PCP-II decrees has been used by\nprofessors.\n\n\nThis is the \" \" see-judge-act &rdquo; \"\nmethod.\n\n\nIn brief, it means that learners begin with a situationer, followed\nby an evaluation or judgment of the situation according to the\nJudaeo-Christian tradition.\n\n\nThen, a decision to act is made that will bring about liberating\ntransformation.\n\n\nThis, too, is associated with the  praxis  method\nas opposed to a mere theoretical and academic approach to theology.\n\n\nGovernment and non-government organizations can easily relate to a\nkind of theology that gives primary importance to the real situation and to\nthe subsequent pastoral action taken. \n\n \n\nLately, our faculty members and graduate students, through the\nCommitted Associates in Religious Education ( CARE), have been giving\nseminar-workshops to religion teachers in the provinces.\n\n\nWhat has been accomplished in those workshops are the integration of\nschool curricula to the vision-mission of a school and the upgrading of\nteachers on content and methodology.\n\n\nReligion teachers from different provinces get to meet one another\nand exchange experiences relevant to an inculturated and contextualized\ninstruction. \n\n \n\nEducation in the countryside is one of the most neglected areas\nin terms of national leadership.\n\n\nInaccessibility and unavailability of adequate resources are some of\nthe reasons.\n\n\nThat is why, since the CED started bringing educational resources to\nprovinces such as Isabela and Davao, religious educators have gone along with\nthem.\n\n\nConsidering the close collaboration of teachers in the provinces, the\ntraining and formation given to the religion teachers of Catholic\ninstitutions pass over to public institutions in those areas. \n\n \n\nOverall, the contribution of DLSU 's RSD and RVEP to national\ndevelopment has been a modest one.\n\n\nSince we are dealing with students who have not yet assumed high\npositions crucial to national development and social transformation, the\nresults remain to be seen.\n\n\nIf what they have learned can already help them in their daily lives\nas Christians in the world and in society, then we can already claim partial\nsuccess.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ca3c2c45-1223-4796-a0d4-46195476fd7c", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.171272+00:00"}
{"text": "DO FILIPINO FEMALES TELL NARRATIVES THE WAY FILIPINO MALES\nDO?  \n\n\n Cecilia M. Mendiola \n\n\n Philippine Normal University \n\n\n  1. INTRODUCTION  \n\n \n\nGender has long been recognized as a sociolinguistic variable (\nWolfson 1982, 1989; Librando 1972; Trudgill 1974, 1984; Labov 1972) that\nconditions the way language is used in everyday social interactions.\n\n\nTo illustrate, Labov observes that women use preferred, socially 'correct',\nnon-stigmatized phonological variants more than men.\n\n\nTheir tendency to use more 'correct forms' than men is upheld in\nTrudgill 's Norwich study.\n\n\nOn the other hand, Wolfson 's investigation of compliments in American\nsociety reveals the interaction of topic of compliment with the status and\nthe sex of the addressee.\n\n\nThe effect of status as a variable, she asserts, is very strong when\nthe sex of the addressee is male.\n\n\nHer study shows that upper-status males seldom receive compliments\nwhich have nearly nothing to do with appearance. \n\n \n\nIn linguistic anthropological research, it is commonly assumed\nthat  \" sexual differentiation of speech is expected to occur\nwhenever there is a social division that exists between the roles of men and\nwomen - - that is, universally &rdquo;  ( Gal 1984).\n\n\nThe underlying definition and differentiation of gender roles,\ningrained in boys and girls as early as the socialization process, nourished\nby cultural norms and expectations, in turn, explains gender-related speech\ndifferences ( Millet 1970).\n\n\nTo be feminine in the Philippine context, Mendez  et al.\n ( cited by Medina 1991) hold, girls are expected to be modest and\nreserved, while to manifest masculine behavior, boys must demonstrate\ncourtesy to girls and sportsmanship.\n\n\nTo a large extent, these behaviors are equally reflected in the\ndifferential speech of boys and girls. \n\n \n\nWhile there have been studies of linguistic differences between\nmen and women at various levels of language - - phonology, lexicon, discourse\neven - - to this researcher 's knowledge there are no existing empirical\nstudies on the similarities and differences in men 's and women 's telling of\nstories.\n\n\nThis study, therefore, attempts to fill that gap.\n\n\nSpecifically, this study purports to answer this question: Are there\ngender differences related to the telling of first-person narratives with\nreference to age, role relationship, topic, intimacy of interaction,\nfamiliarity of interaction, and number of interlocutors? \n\n\n  2. RELATED STUDIES  \n\n \n\nStudies on gender distinctions in language use and form spring\nfrom three angles of vision: the structuralist, variationist, and\nethnographic perspectives. \n\n \n\nSapir 's paper on \" \" Abnormal Types of Speech in\nNootka &rdquo; \" ( Philips et al. 1987) singles out sex and rank as\nvariables of social identity most likely to be signaled by linguistic form.\n\n\nHis subsequent paper centers on phonological variants of the same\nmorpheme and on the presence or absence of specific morphemes as means of\nsignaling gender and other aspects of social identity.\n\n\nIn effect, he is suggesting that gender is  \" marked\nindexically into the morphology of a language &rdquo;  .\n\n\nJespersen ( in Philips  et al.  1987), on the\nother hand, claims that lexical differences mark the linguistic distinction\nbetween women and men.\n\n\nThis notion has subsequently influenced Lakoff 's research which\nreveals that both English and Japanese women are more polite than men and\nthat they have maintained conservatism in language structure ( in Philips\n et al.  1987). \n\n \n\nEarlier, Lakoff ( 1975, in Wolfson 1989) has characterized women 's\nlanguage as  \" language of the powerless\",  based on\nobservations and introspection.\n\n\nShe observes that women use almost exclusively certain words such as\n\"  mauve  \" , \"  divine \n\" , even \"  cute  \" , emphatic modifiers\nlike \"  so  \" , \"  such \n\" , \"  very  \" .\n\n\nWomen 's non-assertive behavior is encoded in questions and hedges.\n\n\nFurthermore, they tend to use 'hypercorrect' grammar and punctuation,\nthat is, the use of more formal syntax and pronunciation closer to the\nprestige form than men.\n\n\nThe use of excessively polite forms to express requests distinguishes\nwomen 's speech as  \" less convincing, less intelligent, less\ncompetent, less trustworthy\"  . \n\n \n\nTo determine whether all the features identified as elements of\nJapanese women 's speech are part of a Japanese women speech register,\nShibamoto ( 1987) sampled speech data from situations in which women\ntypically emphasize femininity and those in which they do not.\n\n\nResults reveal that lexical and morphological features seem to be\ndirectly related to the impression of femininity, while syntactic features\nlike deletion and postposing do not.\n\n\nShe asserts that  \" socially patterned syntactic\ndifferences will generally be less subject to awareness than morphological\ndifferences &rdquo;  . \n\n \n\nWhile accepting that linguistic differences between men 's and\nwomen 's speech exist in Samoan society, Ochs ( 1987) considers this marginal\nto what is shared by the speakers.\n\n\nIn complex ways, she reports, social rank interacts with gender.\n\n\nFor other contexts, relative age and political status are better\nindicators of usage patterns than gender.\n\n\nMen and women of relatively higher rank speak differently from men\nand women of lower tank, as shown in the expressions of sympathy in\nnarratives and the use of case markings in family conversations.\n\n\nThe use of case markings in conversations outside one 's family is\nconditioned by gender, age, and political status. \n\n \n\nLabov 's study ( in Milroy 1987; Philips  et al.\n 1987; Trudgill 1974; Labov 1972) of gender differences in language\nuse stems from the variationist perspective.\n\n\nUsing language samples from actual speech of American English\nspeakers during taped interviews, Labov claims that women use preferred,\nsocially 'correct', non-stigmatized phonological variants more than men.\n\n\nWomen, in effect, engage in hyper-correction, that is, speaking more\nlike the middle class speakers than what they really are - - working class\nmembers. \n\n \n\nTrudgill 's ( 1974, 1984) Norwich study corroborates Labov 's\nfindings that women 's speech leans toward the more 'correct' and 'standard'\nvariety than men 's.\n\n\nContrastingly, men 's preferred speech behavior slants toward the\nworking class non-standard variety, perceived to be higher in status and more\nprestigious.\n\n\nThis working class speech carries masculine connotations associated\nwith toughness and roughness, bestowing on its users 'covert prestige'. \n\n \n\nOn the function of \" 'you know' \" in women 's\nand men 's speech, Holmes ' ( 1986) investigations reveals a pattern of use\nwhich runs counter to the stereotype of women as unconfident\nconversationalists.\n\n\nUtilizing naturally occurring spontaneous speech, Holmes asserts that\nwhile men use \" ' you know' \" more frequently than women to\nsignal the fact that the message is imprecisely and unsatisfactorily encoded,\nwomen use it more often for positive functions, such as emphasis and as a\npositive politeness strategy, as in expressing solidarity by generally\nattributing relevant knowledge to their addressee. \n\n \n\nIn Adams and Edelsky 's ( 1989) preliminary study on male and\nfemale styles in political debates, it appears that gender has interactive\nrelationship with the persona, the experience of the candidate, the structure\nof the event, the region, ethnicity, and probably other factors.\n\n\nIn other words, the differential language forms and discourse styles\nused by men and women political debaters are inseparable from those\nvariables. \n\n \n\nTo assess the interaction of variable syntax and discourse in\nwomen 's and men 's speech, Philips and Reynolds ( 1987) have analyzed\nprospective jurors ' speech, focusing on the rate of contraction and deletion\nof subject pronouns and auxiliary/main verb.\n\n\nIn this discourse-based approach, they have found that \n\" men 's speech is less redundant than women 's in the context where\nthere is a relatively high degree of redundancy in information delivery\n&rdquo;  .\n\n\nData show that men delete subject pronouns and auxiliary/main verbs\nmore often then women.\n\n\nMethodologically, the study is significant because it views gender\ndistinctions in language use in the context of naturally occurring speech\nrather than in the context of sociolinguistic interviews. \n\n \n\nThe third approach to gender distinctions is ethnographic, in\nwhich language is studied as  \" it occurs naturally and normally\nwith particular attention to the ways in which the social features of the\ncontext in which speech occurs interact with the forms of speech &rdquo;\n . \n\n \n\nInvestigating non-Western societies and using whole speech\ngenres, Sherzer ( 1987) suggests that gender differences in language use are\nmost likely to be governed by speaking roles and discourse genres associated\nwith those roles.\n\n\nIn Kuna Indian society, for instance, men dominate the activities\nrelated to public political meetings and illness-curing rituals.\n\n\nBy contrast, women perform lullabies and tuneful weeping during\nkeening which are private genres.\n\n\nHe claims that in relatively small-scale, homogeneous and\nnon-literate societies in which gender distinctions are well defined, it is\n \" verbal genres, speaking roles and patterns of speaking that\nare the primary linguistic manifestations of these gender distinctions\n&rdquo;  .\n\n\nThis view contradicts the notion that variable grammatical\ndifferences, not verbal genre differences, mark gender distinctions. \n\n \n\nSex differences exist in Koasati, a Muskogean language spoken in\nsouthwest Louisiana where women 's speech is considered archaic and 'better'\nthan men 's ( Haas, in Trudgill 1974).\n\n\nAt the present time, though, the women 's forms are used only by\nolder women and preserved in tales where a female character is speaking. \n\n \n\nIn Malagasy, Keenan ( 1974) reports, open or direct confrontation\nis avoided.\n\n\nOne is expected not to put another in an uncomfortable or unpleasant\nsituation.\n\n\nHowever, when a great need for direct speech arises, it is the women,\nnot the men, who break the norm and engage in confrontational talk. \n\n \n\nLibrando 's ( 1987) ethnographic investigation of requesting\nsuggests that in the Philippine office setting, females tend to make more\nrequests than males.\n\n\nThis finding implies that requesting must be gender-dependent. \n\n \n\nProbing into gender-linked differences in language change in a\nHungarian-German bilingual town in Austria, Gal ( 1984) holds that women are\nleading the shift from the use of Hungarian to German which is associated\nwith urban opportunity.\n\n\nHer ethnographic study shows that young women 's rejection of peasant\nlife, coupled by their refusal to marry local peasant men, preferring\nindustrial workers instead, explains the decline of stable bilingualism and\nthe use of only one language in all interactions in Oberwart, Austria.\n\n\nGal further argues that women 's language choices and their\nlinguistic innovativeness indicate women 's greater contribution to social\nchange. \n\n\n  3. METHODOLOGY  \n\n \n\nIn collecting naturally occurring speech for this study,\nsociolinguistic fieldwork was employed through participant observation and\nnon-participant or anonymous observation.\n\n\nStretches of everyday conversations laced with personal narratives\nformed the corpus of the study. \n\n \n\nThe language samples consisted of first-person narratives\nrecounted by Tagalog speakers in their conversations.\n\n\nA total of 60 narratives, 30 per gender, were generated by a variety\nof narrators.\n\n\nThe females were represented by students, housewives, professors,\nteachers, a bookkeeper, nurses, an overseas contract worker, a  \nbalikbayan   or Filipino expatriate in the U.S., a fish vendor,\nhousehelp, a hotel cashier, on NGO director, and a grandmother.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the male tellers were college students, engineers,\na mechanic, a machinist, factory workers, an overseas contract worker,\npolicemen, a police officer, professors, drivers, PMA cadets, a veterinarian,\na newspaper vendor, and a  barangay  official.\n\n\nTheir ages ranged from 12 to 80 among the females, 17 to 55 among the\nmales. \n\n \n\nA large number of speech situations in which the conversation was\ninterspersed with stories were sampled.\n\n\nThese included family encounters during reunions, barrio fiestas,\nChristmases, death anniversaries, birthdays, All Saints ' Day celebrations,\narrival of  balikbayans  , and home visits.\n\n\nConversations containing stories and exchanged during social visits\nafter a woman 's childbirth; on New Year 's Eve; at the workplace such as the\nfaculty room, a police station; in school, at boarding houses, in private and\npublic transportation, during drinking sessions, even in service encounters\nwere represented in the corpus.\n\n\nMetro Manila was the research site of the communicative events and\nsituations. \n\n \n\nWhat stories get told by Tagalog narrators in conversations?\n\n\nAs shown in Table 1 both female and male tellers can talk freely\nabout their weaknesses.\n\n\nThey are not embarrassed to disclose experiences that highlight their\nflaws, ignorance, inadequacy, mistakes, failures, carelessness such as losing\nthings, being had by someone, being caught by authorities, fumbling in the\nkitchen, etc.\n\n\nAs if to strike a balance between negative and positive, they equally\nshare \" success &rdquo; stories like overcoming a phobia, displaying\n\" survival &rdquo; skills, topping a board exam, bluffing their way,\nlanding a job, licking an incurable illness, refusing bribes, etc.\n\n\nFurther, events beyond one 's control such as accidents and natural\nphenomena are exchanged during conversations.\n\n\nStories that dwell on relationships and family-related topics also\nappear in the corpus.\n\n\n'Exploits' and 'adventures', including chance meetings with movie\nstars, are found infrequently in the data. \n\n \n\nOn topics beyond one 's control, Tagalog male narrators talk\nabout experiences on how they have been inconvenienced by unexpected delays\nin trips or changed schedules, both of which are non-threatening to their\npersons.\n\n\nFemale tellers, on the other hand, share personal experiences that do\nnot only inconvenience them but also directly jeopardize their safety, such\nas being victimized by holduppers and pickpockets.\n\n\nThey also talk about natural phenomena like earthquake and fire which\nendanger property, life, and limb.\n\n\nOne may ask: When women tell such stories, are they making a\nstatement about their helplessness before the might of others?\n\n\nDoes this reflect how society views women - - weak, fragile,\ntherefore, prone to being victims?\n\n\nWhy don't male tellers narrate what is expected of men - - alert,\nagile, always in control of the situation, and exempted from \" falling\nfrom grace\"? \n\n \n\nEven if there are only three occurrences of 'exploit' and 'adventure'\nstories, they differ significantly in content.\n\n\nThe female narrator 's story centers on her first experience of\nmanipulating the slot machine at a Reno casino, seemingly a 'harmless'\nexercise by a Filipino tourist on American soil.\n\n\nBy contrast, the 'exploits' in male stories carry sexual overtones.\n\n\nExchanged in an all-male context ( i.e., drinking session and\nmale-room talk) by participants of almost the same age, who have been\nroommates for a long time or who belong to the same peer group, sex, a taboo\ntopic of conversation ( Andres 1989), surfaces in the narrators ' voyeurism\nstories.\n\n\nNo such subject emerges in all-female contexts nor in contexts of\nmales narrating to a mixed-gender audience.\n\n\nThis clearly illustrates the interaction of gender, topic, age, and\nfamiliarity of interaction in the telling of personal narratives.\n\n\nThe all-male context seems to nurture the telling of a taboo story,\ntold with  braggadocio  .\n\n\nPossibly, the presence of liquor may also have loosened up\ninhibitions.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "25b39c2f-731f-46e2-91fe-0adb07581e1e", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.172642+00:00"}
{"text": "A ( NON) INTRODUCTION TO  DIFFERANCE  :\nTHE EDUCATION OF THE PAGAN  \n\n\n Ranhilio Callangan Aquino \n\n \n\nThis paper is a journal of my incursion into the forbidding region\nof \"  differance  . &rdquo;\n\n\nIt is not easy to say when one has reached it, nor in fact that one is\never in it, because every effort is made to deny it a locus, a standing, a\npresence.\n\n\nAnd yet it is the temper of an epoch that labels itself \"\n\" post-modern &rdquo; \" and it instills an ubiquitous\nsuspicion for everything philosophy and life have ever stood on and invoked.\n\n\nNot that we have not known suspicion in the past, but this that traces\nout its difference is utterly sinister and cleverly scheming.\n\n\nWhen asked its name, it responds with a non-name: it can only be\nsuggested by the silence and non-presence of that which \" differs\n&rdquo; and makes a \" difference. &rdquo;\n\n\nIt claims its force from the very presence that it questions and\nrelativizes.\n\n\nIt has been there all along, and therefore not really there! \n\n \n\nI offer a reading of three essays: Derrida 's now well-known\nintriguing, irritating   Differance   , Culler 's\nlucid synthesis in  Deconstruction as a Method of Reading and of\nInterpretation  , and Lyotard 's  Being Pagan and Being Just  .\n\n\nThis sequence, I hope, will be useful: from wending our way through\n\"  differance  , &rdquo; then through its practice\nin \" deconstruction &rdquo; to the  problematique \nof being just. \n\n \n\nThis is a non-introduction, for how else should one label the\neffort at introducing what its ministers insist is a non-presence, and a\nradical questioning of the privileges of \"  logos \n\" ? \n\n\n   Differance   \n\n \n\nThe difference between sounds is not itself a sound, and yet it\nis that very non-audible difference - - a non-sound - - that allows each\nsound to be a distinct sound.\n\n\nThe difference between things is made possible by the non-presence of\nthat without which it would be other.\n\n\nThe same thing can be said of conceptualizing, for it is the play of\ndifferences that accounts for the possibility of conceptualizing.\n\n\nThe content of the concept is not all that goes into the making of\nthe concept for it is the non-content of differing that makes possible the\nmarking off of one thought that is not another.\n\n\nThe present keeps within itself the non-present: the mark of the past\nand its relation to the future, for how else could present be?\n\n\nThe present is a synthesis, insofar as it can be present only as\nretention of the past and protention of the future.\n\n\nIs it not then fairly clear that the present is so as marked off by\nthe non-present?\n\n\nThus insinuated is the non-present and the never-presented. \n\n \n\nTo ask where to begin, and to criticize other beginnings as false\nstarts, is to presume that there is one, univocal origin.\n\n\nBut if presences are marked only because of a non-present, it is\npresumptuous to declare one starting point, a singular, unequivocal\nfoundation which, though not yet found, must nevertheless be sought. \n\n \n\nThe seriousness of going after a declared \" origin, &rdquo;\nan \"  arche  \" must then give way to play.\n\n\nThe maturation of post-modernism is the growing beyond a logic that\nopposes duplicity, equivocation and amphibology.\n\n\nIt is the deliberate assumption of the philosophical seriousness of\nplay, a celebration of \"  differance  \" as\npolysemic.\n\n\nIt is the recognition of the fecundity of amphibology, the very\nrecognition that allows a philosopher like Levinas to employ the language of\nbeing at the service of an \" otherwise than being. &rdquo; \n\n \n\n  Differance   then is primordial\nmovement, for what other way is there to protest against the aprioristic\nclaims of Being as presence except in the language of the ancient contrast\nbetween Heraclitus and Parmenides?\n\n\n  Differance   is also the name of the\ndisposition to see in every system of affirmations a \" weave of\ndifferences. &rdquo; \n\n \n\nTo recognize \"  differance  \" is\nthen to concede that the questions: What differs? Who differs? What is\n differance  ? are not answered, nay, should not even be\nposed!\n\n\n\"  Differance  \" though passes\njudgment on any pretended rigorous and irreducible opposition: fiction.\n\n\nThere does not seem any other way, though, except to write ( to\nspeak) fiction, and \"  differance  \" does not\nforbid this.\n\n\nIt only forbids us from forgetting that it is fiction. \n\n \n\nCentral to my reading of Derrida is the persuasion that we will\nand must go on positing, affirming - - constructing.\n\n\n\"  Differance  \" however is the call\nto courage, for it is what keeps us from resting in the comfort and assurance\nof a theoretical construct: a fixed opposition, a recognized presence.\n\n\n\"  Differance  \" is the move that\ncauses the construct to tremble, not because it is not good enough, or\nbecause another construct might better resist the trembling, but because\ntrembling is what must follow in the wake of every fissure that is at the\nfoundation of every construct!\n\n\nThere can be no anticipation of a \" higher synthesis, &rdquo; a\nsuperior resolution.\n\n\nThere can only be the constant readiness - - perhaps eagerness - -\nfor the disquiet that \"  differance  \" brings.\n\n\n \n\nThere is no metaphysics of  differance  , for\nit is the questioning of every metaphysics.\n\n\nIt proposes no resolution of the disquiet for it is the call to\npersevering disquiet.\n\n\nIt is the invitation to play - - to dance not only for the moment,\nbut whenever one stakes out a site, marks out a \" here. &rdquo; \n\n \n\nIs all this perhaps a philosophical fad that will wear out in\nbetter times, a terrible epoch of trembling from which we will emerge into\nthe light?\n\n\nIf, as philosophers have consistently observed, Being dissimulates\nitself in beings, it is this very dissimulation, this very differing and\ndeferring that is suggested by  differance  .\n\n\n\" Older &rdquo; then than every ontological difference, its\nnon-presence and non-site allow it to be permanent to and situated within\nphilosophy and more basically within thought. \n\n\n  Deconstruction  \n\n \n\nTo speak Greek in order to undo Greek: all deconstruction is\nstealth because, I have suggested, it is the very movement of the fissure on\nwhich every construct rises.\n\n\nEvery philosophy, every theory contains its own deconstruction.\n\n\nDeconstruction has no rules, for only systems have rules, and\ndeconstruction is the undoing of every system.\n\n\nIt is giving vent to  differance  .\n\n\nIts moves though are identifiable: the subversion of a hierarchy and\nthe displacement of a system.\n\n\nThis is nothing more though than to say: it moves, it shakes up. \n\n \n\nBut why deconstruct?\n\n\nQuite simply because every construct bears its own deconstruction - -\na move which in  naivete  may be postponed but cannot be\nignored.\n\n\nNot to deconstruct would be in bad faith to turn one 's back to the\nrichness and the challenge that the questioning have to offer.\n\n\nIt is to hug the coast with shameful timidity and so miss the\ndiscovery! \n\n \n\nIt is necessary to posit, it is necessary to construct.\n\n\nDeconstruction, however, imposes an additional task: to deconstruct\nwhat has been constructed so that every postulation in its own questioning\nand undoing may neither claim more than it can do, nor achieve less than what\nit can. \n\n \n\nIf it is the effect that brings to light the cause, is not effect\ncause, and cause effect?\n\n\nAnd further on, what then is there to the hierarchy of cause and\neffect?\n\n\nA supplement is an addition to what is complete.\n\n\nBut to that which is complete, what can be added?\n\n\nIf there is addition, the complete is not complete.\n\n\nWhat then of the scheme of supplementation? \n\n \n\nPhilosophy lives by meaning.\n\n\nIt is justified by the search of meaning.\n\n\nBut, deconstruction shows, the meaning of \" meaning &rdquo; is\nindeterminate.\n\n\nThis warns, humbles and excites.\n\n\nThis obsession with meaning and the assumption that what is sought\nfor must be something definite is but an aspect of philosophy 's \nlogocentrism  .\n\n\nThe deconstructive move shows that speech, which has been usually\naccorded privileged status in comparison to writing, is actually a form of\nthe \" proto-writing &rdquo; - - but the interplay of differences - -\nthat makes possible both speech and writing.\n\n\nBut  phonocentrism  is merely a variant of\n logocentrism  , the same syndrome evidenced by a\npreference for the immediacy of sensation, for demonstration and argument and\nfor lingering belief that truth somehow hides behind appearances.\n\n\nIts moves are familiar: making clear, grasping, demonstrating,\nrevealing. \n\n \n\nBut deconstruction is unrelenting: Is not presence so only\nbecause it bears absence?\n\n\nIs not every attempt to found a theory of language on entities bound\nto fail because a system of signs is always a system of the non-signified by\nwhich each sign can be distinct? \n\n \n\nMeaning, we find out, is context-bound.\n\n\nCan the challenge of mastering context be met?\n\n\nDid not Wittgenstein suggest that we familiarize ourselves with the\ngame so that we can play it?\n\n\nBut no context can ever be saturated.\n\n\nThere is no limit to what can be a part of a context, so that in\nprinciple a context is boundless.\n\n\nIn fact, any attempt to describe, much less circumscribe, a context\nalways results in a new context!\n\n\nAnd this is not because we are not clear enough but it cannot be done\nin a manner that makes superfluous all future doing.\n\n\nWhen it is done - - and this seems to be one point not sufficiently\nstressed - - its tentativity and artificiality must at all times be\nperformatively conceded. \n\n \n\nDeconstruction does not suppress the hermeneutic project.\n\n\nIt does however constantly hold out the paltry ( ? ) - - rather\nsalutary tenet of the indeterminacy of the meaning of \" meaning.\n&rdquo;\n\n\nWhen meaning is indeterminate, however, does this not wreck the\nproject of justice? \n\n\n  Being Just  \n\n \n\nThere are no metanarratives.\n\n\nThere is no mastername.\n\n\nNot that there are no narratives and names, but rather that each\nmakes as good a claim as the other.\n\n\nThe just man cannot ever lay claim to a privilege other codes do not\nhave.\n\n\nThe just man is just because he acts justly, virtuously.\n\n\nBut if he abides by no code ( although he may enunciate codes and\nannounce them), then in response to the challenge to do justice, we are not\nin the region of   episteme   , but of \n techne   - - the doing of justice.\n\n\nWe must respond - - often we will - - to the demands of a situation\njustly, but without benefit of code, model or criteria.\n\n\nJustice then calls for strategy, and this does not make it any less\njust.\n\n\nIf anything at all, it makes it more difficult, for it is infinitely\neasier to refer some fact or act to a prewritten code to which then one\napplies a pre-determined solution.\n\n\nBut strategy calls for a mastery of the situation that is courageous\nand admirable precisely because it cannot invoke any supporting, supplying\nand comforting metanarrative. \n\n \n\nThe paganism of justice does not only consist in a vagueness ( or\nvagary) of source.\n\n\nThe just man is, of course, pagan because he cannot ( will not!)\nsupport his claims by proof-texts from some sacred scripture.\n\n\nHe is pagan also insofar as he speaks because he has been spoken to.\n\n\nThe just man entertains no illusions that his pronouncements mark new\nbeginnings, lay down new foundations.\n\n\nRather, he announces, he pronounces, because the anonymous spirits\nand deities of the field have spoken to him a message already forgotten.\n\n\nOnce more, I find it necessary to emphasize that he does not preach\nsome privileged message, some sacred gospel.\n\n\nRather he speaks in a tradition of speaking, and in a sense, his\nannouncements continue the announcements he himself received; but in another\nsense, he must make up the story he must just pass on.\n\n\nThis would be easy.\n\n\nBut philosophy was not meant to be easier than life.\n\n\nRather, he must, in a very real sense \" make up &rdquo; the\nstory without pretending that he found it. \n\n\n  Conclusion: The Education of Pagans  \n\n \n\nIt is not easy to sever ties with a romantic past.\n\n\nThere will always be nostalgia for \" natural law, &rdquo; for\n\" ultimate causes, &rdquo; for \" first principles &rdquo; - - for\nfoundations.\n\n\nWould not in fact education be far easier if we could just set our\nsights on looking for the \" mastername\"?\n\n\nThe education of pagans must necessarily be the education for\ndifficulty.\n\n\nIt must be capable of translating all claims, constructs and models\ninto  fracta  and undecidables, while being ready to\nappreciate and to credit the contribution they make.\n\n\nIt will, of course, foster suspicion because deconstruction is, in a\nvery worthwhile sense, a hermeneutic of suspicion.\n\n\nWhatever offers the chance for an excited but determined \"\n Eureka  \" is necessarily suspect. \n\n \n\nIt is education that will be respectful of the \" \nagora  , &rdquo; the marketplace of ideas, views and claims.\n\n\nSome gods may be tagged at higher prices than others, but the\neducated person will always deal with them as marketable, exchangeable,\nfreely negotiable.\n\n\nFar from being their weakness, this will be the strength of all that\nis brought to the  agora  , for what is offered there is\nall that is available!\n\n\nHe will then pursue with great interest a study of the classics of\nthe past, in much the same way that he will take interest in what is said and\nwritten in the present.\n\n\nAnd he will take all this seriously - - as proposals. \n\n \n\nThe education of the pagan will bring to his attention the\nserious demand that he be just, and it will impress upon him the seriousness\nof the task by impressing upon him \" responsibility. &rdquo;\n\n\nHe must act, and he must speak, because he has been addressed by\nteachers, and leaders, and elders.\n\n\nBut when he acts and speaks, he cannot act out a script written for\nhim, nor merely read a text prepared for him.\n\n\nThere is none, and there will be none.\n\n\nTo be just, he must write his own text; he must ingeniously set\nforth his own script.\n\n\nHe will not, of course, pretend that he is writing for all forever.\n\n\nHe will only be too happy to write within a tradition that has\nalways written that makes him write in turn. \n\n \n\nThe hope that is to be encouraged is not eschatological, for we\ndo not look forward to deliverance from \" the dark night &rdquo;

Gonzalez, in his literary autobiography,  \nKalutang  : A Filipino in the World  , describes his experience\nas a Filipino writer in English using the image of the Hanunoo Mangyan\nwalking down the mountain trail interminably making music with two wooden\nsticks - the   kalutang   .\n\n\nAccording to Hanunoo beliefs, when a person travels, his or her soul\ntrails along and the song from the   kalutang   helps\nthe soul to know where the body is.\n\n\nThis playing of the   kalutang   is important\nbecause, according to the Hanunoos, the soul can be distracted by things\nalong the way or be waylaid by forest spirits.\n\n\nWithout the music of the kalutang the soul may not find the body and\nremain lost in the forests! \n\n \n\nGonzalez uses this motif as frame for narration of his experiences\nas a Filipino writer in English, literally and figuratively travelling in\nforeign lands, seeking his way home.\n\n\nGonzalez writes a literary autobiography that documents the impact of\ncolonialism and neocolonialism on his personal history, as well as on the\nother Filipino writers in English of his generation.  3. 4.\n\n\n  Translation as a Playing of the   Kalutang\n   \n\n \n\nIn this paper, I am using the metaphor developed by Gonzalez to\nunderscore the importance of the translation of Philippine literature in\nEnglish into Filipino.\n\n\nI am referring mainly, but not exclusively, to literary writings in\nEnglish by the first two generations of Filipino writers in English who were\neducated and wrote during the period of American colonization and the period\nimmediately after.\n\n\nThe translation of these works can be a form of recuperation or\nresocialization by making them accessible to more Filipinos and by\nreappropriating them as a part of the mainstream Philippine literature.\n\n\nIn other words, translation is a way of playing the  \nkalutang   , a way of bringing these texts 'home'. \n\n \n\nThis paper asserts that the translation of Philippine writing in\nEnglish to Filipino is a political act, a contribution to the process of\ndecolonization of our country.\n\n\nTranslation is a playing of the   kalutang  \n, a ritual of healing the split between the national  psyche\n and the body caused by colonization and maintained by its new\nforms.\n\n\nTranslation of these texts can contribute to this process of healing\nby memorializing the wounds of neocolonization that are presented,\nconsciously or subconsciously, in the form and images of these texts.\n\n\nThis translation project aims to memorialize the fact of colonization\nand neocolonization for a people notorious for its short memory, for a people\nwith a tendency to forget the wounds inflicted by colonization in order to\navoid dealing with it.\n\n\nThe translation, at the same time, aims to memorialize the resources\nof a people to heal its wounds, resources that are also portrayed in some of\nthese texts. \n\n \n\nFor example, in N.V.M. Gonzalez 's novel,  A Season of Grace\n ( 1954), just as Sabel deftly weaves a  banig  with the\nword  \" Recuerdo &rdquo;  ( Remember), the author\nweaves a novel that calls Filipinos to remember who they are.\n\n\nRichard Guzman, a literary critic, points out that Gonzalez in his\nnovel is countering the dominant myths in Filipino neo-colonial society:\n \" the myths of the Philippines ' irretrievably lost native\npast, of her people 's weakness, of the near triumph of the foreign &rdquo;\n ( 1995:182).\n\n\nWhat countermyth does Gonzalez offer?\n\n\nGonzalez uses images of farmers crossing seas on frail \nbatels  like migrant rats, of hawks preying on chicken, of burnt\nloam teeming with life underneath the ashes - symbols of what Gonzalez calls\nthe essential stories of Filipino life. \n\n\nGuzman explores such symbols in \"  A Season of Grace\n \" and rediscovers the inner strength of the Filipino in the\nface of extensive corruption, social indifference, violence, and colonial\nmentality that plague contemporary Filipino society.\n\n\nGuzman concludes:  \" The native culture will survive, it\nseems to say, and by an inner strength that antedates colonialism &rdquo;\n ( p. 189).  5. 6.\n\n\n  Definition of Translation  \n\n \n\nTranslation as a playing of the   kalutang \n entails transforming the English texts into Filipino.\n\n\nTranslation cannot merely be a transliteration, a word for word\nequivalence, from English to Filipino.\n\n\nAccording to Rabasa ( 1989:1), translation is a transformation, a\nform of adaptation of an original text from one language to another.\n\n\nThe process of translation is determined both by the interpreter and\nthe circumstance, and this circumstance is  \" a very clearly\ninscribed cultural and historical context\"  ( Basanett-MacGuire\n1991:xi). \n\n \n\nThe anthropologist James T. Siegel sees a pervasive connection\nbetween translation and affirming or resisting a particular social order.\n\n\nVicente Rafael, who uses Siegel in his study, describes the way\nSiegel conceives of the process of translation as \" the process of\nreshaping one 's thoughts and actions in accordance with the accepted norms\nof a community. &rdquo;  ( Rafael, 1988:210-211)\n\n\n \n\nThe context or the social order wherein this translation project\noccurs is postcolonial.\n\n\nIn such a context, translation between the language of the\nex-colonizer and the language of the ex-colonized becomes a political act, a\npower struggle.\n\n\nGiven our historico-socio-political situation, English is seen as a 'stronger'\nand 'dominating' language vis-&aacute;-vis Filipino which is seen as the 'weaker'\nand 'dominated' language.\n\n\nTalal Asad ( in \" Concept of Cultural Translation\", 157, cited\nin Villareal 1993) writes:  \" ...because the languages of Third\nWorld countries... are \" weaker &rdquo; in relation to Western\nlanguages ( and today, especially to English), they 're more likely to submit\nto forcible transformation in the translation process than the other way\naround.\"  \n\n \n\nTranslation is not merely a transposition of one language to\nanother, but also that of a culture to another culture.\n\n\nTranslation is an interaction, inevitably a power struggle between\ntwo different value systems. \n\n \n\nNote that in the translation of Filipino literature in English,\nwe are translating from Filipino English, in itself a form of \"\ntranslation\", a locus of interaction between the Filipino writers ' native\ntongue with the culture and history it contains and that of the English of\nthe Anglo-American.\n\n\nI believe that Filipino English as used by Filipino writers,\nGonzalez, for example, is a form of documentation of neocolonization and the\nFilipino writers ' struggle to resist and appropriate what is foreign\naccording to Filipino purposes. \n\n \n\nHowever, despite the development of a Filipino English, N.V.M.\nGonzalez realizes the need to translate Philippine writing in English to\nFilipino.\n\n\n  7. 8.\n\n\n  Translation as a Valid Academic Exercise  \n\n \n\nIt is not only the body of Filipino writings in English that\nneeds bringing home.\n\n\nThe Filipino academic, who in the Philippine context is often both\nstudent (  i.e.  , researcher) and the teacher, working on\nEnglish language and literature, needs to go home, too.\n\n\nIn a recent teacher training seminar conducted by the Ateneo Center\nfor English Language Teaching, Filipino teachers of English admitted their\nfeeling of inadequacy in talking of Philippine culture in their English\nlanguage and literature classes even when the texts used are Philippine\nwritings in English.\n\n\nSeveral of the teacher participants from Metro Manila and other\nnearby provinces spoke of how their own education as teachers had\nAmericanized them. \n\n \n\nThis shows how the Filipino academic working on English language\nand literature does not need to go literally abroad to be alienated from the\nmajority of Filipinos who are more and more losing proficiency in the use of\nthe English language.\n\n\nThe Filipino academic is constantly out on the trail ( by\nprofessional necessity), entering foreign forests to hunt for 'food' and 'medicine'\n( language and literary theories and concepts) for the tribe 's ( Filipino\nsociety, especially, the academic 's students) survival.\n\n\nIn his or her journeys, the soul of the Filipino academic working on\nEnglish language and literature is constantly bombarded by foreign\ninterpellations that may waylay it from his body.\n\n\nWithout the soul, the Filipino academic cannot remember who he is,\nwhere he is from, why he is where he is, and where he is going.\n\n\nIt is the rhythm of his   kalutang   that\nserves as a shield or   pangontra   that allows him\nto interpellate back these voices.\n\n\nWithout the   kalutang   , the Filipino\nacademic working on English language and literature is doomed to the fate of\nan external exile in his own land - without a tribe, without a home, without\na self.\n\n\nFor the Filipino academic working on English language and literature,\nthis   kalutang   , this cultural shield, this\n  pangontra   , is something indigenous, native, most\nhimself - his native language.\n\n\nTranslation therefore is an enterprise the Filipino academic has to\nengage in out of necessity, to save his or her soul. \n\n \n\nMoreover, this paper asserts that translation projects and\nstudies are fields worthy of academics.\n\n\nContrary to the prevalent misconception of translation as \"\nless intellectual &rdquo; compared to the traditional research projects,\ntranslation in fact provides the crucible for testing the Filipino academic\nunderstanding of foreign concepts and wisdom in applying these to concrete\nFilipino experience.\n\n\nMs. Benilda Santos, Ateneo de Manila professor, poet, and translator,\nregards translations as  \" a most necessary academic pursuit for\nacademicians. &rdquo;   \n\n \n\nThese Filipino academics in English can be invaluable to the\nFilipino community if they write in or translate into Filipino.\n\n\nThey are in contact with the ideas of the international community\nwhich uses English as its  lingua franca  .\n\n\nThey are in a position to interpellate the neo-colonial powers and\nquestion their ambitions.\n\n\nThey are in a position to contribute the Filipino worldview to global\ndiscussions. \n\n \n\nTinio recognizes this need for Filipinos who are expert in both\nEnglish and Filipino.\n\n\nHe writes  \" ...we need Filipinos with real expertise in\nEnglish; they are the ones who will provide us a link with the English\nworld.\"   \n\n \n\nThis discussion on bilingualism shows the recognition of the\ngrowing importance of the translator in Philippine society.\n\n\nRolando Tinio ( 1993:147) points to the important role of bilingual\nFilipinos:  \n\n \n\nDr. Eugene Nida, world-renowned expert on linguistics and\ntranslation, in his visit to the Ateneo University last November 1998\nasserted that though the trend globally is that of more and more non-English\nspeaking people studying English to participate in international\ntransactions, the impetus to preserve the native languages will be strong as\nwell for people to nurture their national identity.\n\n\nAgain we see here the crucial role of bilingual academics, especially\nin translation from English to Filipino and from Filipino to English.  9.\n10.\n\n\n  Conclusion  \n\n \n\nThis paper asserts the importance of translating Filipino\nliterature in English to Filipino for the following reasons: \n\n \n\nFirst, despite the development of a Filipino English, Philippine\nliterature in English remains a small tributary of the mainstream of Filipino\nliterature in the vernacular and remains inaccessible to the majority of\nFilipinos.\n\n\nThe translation of Philippine literature in English to Filipino will\nmake available to the majority of Filipinos, especially to students, a\nsignificant body of texts containing reflections on Filipino experiences\nespecially of American colonization and neocolonization, certainly a rich\narea of study. \n\n \n\nSecond, this translation, aside from making Philippine literature\nin English accessible to more Filipinos, is a contribution to the continuing\nprocess of decolonization.\n\n\nIn translating these texts, we are memorializing the wounds of\ncolonization and neocolonization and the resources of a people to heal these\nwounds.\n\n\nWe encourage the use of these Filipino translations of Philippine\nliterature in English in the secondary and tertiary level literature\ncurricula in this framework of continuing decolonization of our country. \n\n \n\nThird, this project affirms the value of translation as a field\nworthy of academics.\n\n\nIt is not \" less intellectual &rdquo; compared to the\ntraditional research projects, but in fact provides the crucible for testing\nthe Filipino academic 's understanding of foreign concepts and wisdom in\napplying these to concrete Filipino experiences.\n\n\nThe bilingual Filipino academic is in the best position to contribute\nto this translation project. \n\n \n\nWe started with the image of the Hanunoo Mangyan travelling down\nthe mountain trail, hunting for food and medicine for the tribe, interminably\nplaying the   kalutang   to make sure he doesn't lose\nhis soul.\n\n\nWe are using this image to show how the Filipino academic, constantly\nin contact with foreign learning and concepts (  e.g. \nlanguage and literary theories and concepts), needs to constantly translate,\nto go back to his native language. \n\n\nMay we join this traveler then as he continues the journey, unafraid\nto foray in foreign forests, knowing that the transformations he\nundergoes as he interacts with the outside world is part of his\nbecoming, as long as he puts his kalutang to music to call his\nsoul home.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6c13f288-1b8d-443f-87b0-70f2b8217179", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.175327+00:00"}
{"text": "Philippine Revolution: A Philosophical Analysis \n\n\n\n Rolando M. Gripaldo \n\n \n\n The author analyzes albeit philosophically three basic terms\nwhich have become controversial in Philippine revolutionary historiography\ntoday.\n\n\nThese terms are \" \" Philippine &rdquo; \" ,\n\" \" revolution &rdquo; \" , and \" \"\nPhilippine Revolution &rdquo; \" .  \n\n\n  INTRODUCTION  \n\n \n\nIn ordinary parlance, any analysis in philosophy is philosophical\nanalysis.\n\n\nIn contemporary philosophy, however, philosophical analysis is a\ntechnical methodology - - an offshoot of the Anglo-American analytic\ntradition in philosophy.\n\n\nIt is a combination of logical analysis as developed by Bertrand\nRussell ( 1972: 828-836) and the logical positivists, especially Rudolf\nCarnap ( 1955:209-25), among others, and linguistic analysis as developed by\nG.E. Moore ( White 1955:20) and Ludwig Wittgenstein ( 1989: 31-36) in his\n\" Philosophical Investigations \" .\n\n\nJohn Searle ( 1972:1) calls this analytic methodology \"\nlinguistic philosophy \" , and he uses it to analyze the meanings and\nthe deep logical structures of general features of language.\n\n\nThe aim of philosophical analysis is to clarify the meanings of\nconcepts of whatever field of study and their theoretical underpinnings.\n\n\nIt is the broad method of conceptual analysis where the analyst can\nhimself modify or reformulate the theories behind the concept.  1 \n\n\n \n\nIn this paper, I will do a philosophical analysis of the term\n\" \" Philippine revolution. &rdquo; \" \n\n\nThere are three basic concepts to be analysed here.\n\n\nThe first is the term \" \" Philippine. &rdquo;\n\"\n\n\nIt is important to understand the evolution of this concept in the\nlight of attempts by some sectors of Philippine society to change the name of\nthe Philippines to \" \" Rizal &rdquo; \" or \"\n\"  Maharlika  , &rdquo; \" etc.\n\n\nTowards the end of my analysis of this term, I will discuss the first\nattempts to replace it.\n\n\nAndres Bonifacio ( 1963: 68-69) and Emilio Jacinto ( 1935: 60) wanted\nto call the Philippine nation as \" \"  Katagalugan\n . &rdquo; \" \n\n \n\nThe second concept is the term \" \" revolution.\n&rdquo; \"\n\n\nIt is significant to analyse this concept in the light of the\ncontinuing debate as to whether Rizal was simply a reformist or truly a\nrevolutionist.\n\n\nWhat is the difference, for example, between a \" reform &rdquo;\nand a \" peaceful revolution\"?\n\n\nWhy is a \" peaceful revolution &rdquo; called a revolution?\n\n\n \n\nThe third concept is the term \" \" Philippine\nrevolution. &rdquo; \"\n\n\nIs it a revolution from above ( the Great Tradition), from below (\nthe Little Tradition), or in between ( the Middle Tradition)?\n\n\nWhat is the criterion of classification?\n\n\nIs it simply the bulk of participants - - the dominant participant\nclass - - in the revolution, or is it the group that initiated or originated\nthe revolution?\n\n\nWhat are some significant differences between the Philippine\nRevolution, the American Revolution, and the French Revolution?\n\n\nIt is probably fruitful to contrast these three revolutions, which\nbelong to the same genre - - i.e., democratic in inclination - - and see some\nof their essential differences. \n\n\n  ON THE CONCEPT \" \" PHILIPPINE &rdquo;\n\"     On \" \" Philippine &rdquo;\n\" and \" \" Filipinos &rdquo; \"  \n\n \n\nFrom our history we know that the term \" Philippine\n\" is derived from the name of the prince of Asturias, \"\nPhilip II \" .\n\n\nIn Spanish he is  Principe Felipe II ( Segundo)  .\n\n\nIn the Spanish tradition, the prince of Asturias is the heir apparent\nof the king of Spain in the same manner that the prince of Wales is the heir\napparent of the king of Great Britain.\n\n\nWhen Ruy Lopez de Villalobos named the island of Tandaya ( now Samar)\nin 1543 as \" \" Felipina &rdquo; \" in honor of the\nprince of Asturias, he knew that Principe Felipe II would be the next king of\nSpain. \n\n \n\nIt was Miguel Lopez de Legaspi who called the entire archipelago\nas \" \" Felipinas &rdquo; \" in 1565 ( later it became\n\" Philipinas &rdquo; or \" Filipinas\").\n\n\nBy this time Philip II was already the king of Spain since his\nfather, Carlos I, decided to retire in 1556.\n\n\nIt was Philip II who ordered the expedition to colonize the\nPhilippines from Mexico.\n\n\nWhen Andres de Urdaneta refused to head the expedition, saying that\nit violated the Treaty of Zaragosa of 1529 since the archipelago lay within\nthe demarcation line of Portugal, Philip II replaced him with Legaspi with\nthe express instruction to colonize the archipelago. \n\n \n\nDuring the early part of Spanish colonization, Pedro Chirino in\n1604, Juan Francisco de San Antonio in 1738, and Francisco Antolin in 1739,\ncalled the natives of the archipelago as \" \" Philipinos &rdquo;\n\" or \" \" Filipinos &rdquo; \" ( Scott 1994:\n6).\n\n\nOriginally, the term \" \"  indios \n\" \" simply meant inhabitants of West Indies ( Agoncillo 1981:\n83).\n\n\nLater on, however, the Spaniards used this term pejoratively - - to\nconnote inferiority, indolence, stupidity, fit only to be servants, and the\nlike. \n\n \n\nIn the nineteenth century, the  insulares  or\nCreoles, or Spaniards born in the Philippines, regarded themselves as equal\nto the  peninsulares  or Spaniards born in Spain.\n\n\nBut the  peninsulares  , who considered themselves\nas the true Spaniards, or the true natives of Spain, looked down upon the\n insulares  and called them \" Filipinos \"\n, or natives of the Philippines.\n\n\nDuring the \" Propaganda Movement \" the term\n\" \" Filipino &rdquo; \" was used to include not only\n insulares  but also the urbanized and educated \nindios  like Jose Rizal, Graciano Lopez Jaena, Marcelo H. del Pilar\n et al.  , and the Spanish and Chinese  mestizos\n .\n\n\nBut the common man remained to be called an \"  indio\n \" .\n\n\nLeon Ma. Guerrero ( 1974: 1-549) considered Rizal as the first\nFilipino because the latter was the first to think in terms of the\nPhilippines as a nation.\n\n\nDuring the Philippine Revolution, Emilio Aguinaldo called all the\nnatives of the Philippines as Filipinos when he issued his first manifesto on\n31 October 1896.\n\n\nLater on, in 1898, Governor General Basilio Agustin called the\n indios  as Filipinos themselves when he solicited their\nhelp against the American forces which were preparing to attack Intramuros (\nGripaldo 1994: 114).\n\n\nIn describing the entire archipelago, the Spaniards and Filipinos\ncalled it \"  \" Islas Filipinas &rdquo; \n\" or simply \" \" Filipinas &rdquo; \" while the\nAmericans called it the \" \" Philippine Islands &rdquo;\n\" or simply the \" \" Philippines. &rdquo; \"\n\n\n \n\nThe term \" Filipino \" , however, was limited\nonly to Christianized natives.\n\n\nThe pagan and  Moro  tribes refused to be called\n\" Filipinos \" .\n\n\nThe Moros in particular viewed the Filipinos as Christians and they\nwould not want to be called Filipinos because they would not want to become\nChristians.\n\n\n Moro  nationalism probably began during the time of\nLaut Buisan ( Majul 1973: 118; De los Santos 1988: 101-102), the sultan of\nMaguindanao, who held a meeting in 1603 with several  datus \nof Leyte at Dulag so that the Leyte  datus  and the\nMaguindanaos can unite to fight against the Spaniards.\n\n\nThis was short-lived, however.\n\n\nHis son,  Sultan  Kudarat, also desired unity in\n1628 against the invaders. \n\n \n\nEmilio Aguinaldo saw the problem of politically integrating the\n Moros  into the national body politic.\n\n\nAn appeal of \" unity &rdquo; was communicated to the \nMoro  leaders ( Agoncillo 1981 271; Majul 1973: 315) to work hand in\nhand with the revolutionists and fight the Americans.\n\n\nThe immediate solution of politically integrating the pagan and\n Moro  tribes would be to make a transition from the\nhistorical meaning of the term \" \" Filipino &rdquo; \"\nto the political or constitutional definition of that term.\n\n\nThe Filipino leaders provided such a definition in the Malolos\nConstitution ( Title IV, Art. 6) where anyone was a Filipino if ( 1) he is\nborn in Philippine territory, including a vessel flying the Philippine flag;\n( 2) he is a child of a Filipino father or mother, although born outside the\nPhilippines; ( 3) he as a foreigner is a naturalized Filipino; and ( 4) he as\na foreigner has acquired residence in any town of the Philippines and paid\ntaxes for two years without interruption.\n\n\nAguinaldo officially communicated his approval of the Malolos\nConstitution on 21 January 1899 ( Agoncillo 1960: 761). \n\n \n\nDuring the American period, the  Moros  wanted a\nseparate independence from the Filipinos.\n\n\nThe American administration in the Philippines decided to unite the\nentire archipelago and introduce education in Moroland, but most of the\n Moros  did not allow their children to enrol for fear of\nbeing educated and then made Filipinos or Christians ( Elequin 1981-82: 83;\nGowing 1981-82: 21-22).\n\n\nFor the Americans, it was important to educate the pagan and \nMoro  tribes so that they could easily be integrated into the\nnational mainstream of political consciousness. \n\n \n\nThe Filipino leaders continued the Malolos tradition and in 1935\nproduced a constitution which defined the Filipino as a person ( 1) who is a\nFilipino citizen at the time of the adoption of the 1935 Constitution; ( 2)\nwho was born in the Philippines of foreign parents but who had been formerly\nelected to public office; ( 3) whose father is a Filipino citizen; ( 4) whose\nmother is a Filipino citizen and who elects Filipino citizenship upon\nreaching the age of majority; and ( 5) who becomes a Filipino citizen by\nnaturalization. \n\n \n\nAfter independence a committee of three Muslim leaders  ( Saber 1979:55) identified the  Moro  Problem\nas a problem of integration into the national body politic through education.\n\n\nFormer Senator Domocao Alonto thereby authored a law creating the\nMindanao State University with the primary purpose of politically integrating\nthe pagan and  Moro  tribes into the mainstream of national\nconsciousness.\n\n\nThe integration process will be political assimilation so that the\nnon-Christian tribes will accept themselves as Filipinos and also cultural\nacculturation so that they will eclectically internalize nonharmful cultural\nvalues from other tribes.\n\n\nAt present there are still a resistance to the term Filipino from the\n Moro  National Liberation Front ( MNLF), Moro Islamic\nLiberation Front ( MILF), and others  who would\nrather want to establish an independent  Bangsa Moro  .\n\n\nVery recently Nur Misuari of the MNLF agreed with the Philippine\ngovernment to run as governor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao and\nat the same time to be the chairman of the Southern Philippines Council for\nPeace and Development. \n\n\n  On \" \" Katagalugan \" \" and\n\" \" Tagalogs \" \"  \n\n \n\nAt this juncture, let me turn the discussion on \"\nKatagalugan \" as the first attempt to change the name of Filipinas\nand of the term \" \" Tagalog &rdquo; \" to replace the\nterm \" \" Filipino. &rdquo; \"\n\n\nThe basis of this interpretation is Bonifacio 's manifesto, \n\" Ang Dapat Mabatid ng mga Tagalog, &rdquo;  which appeared in\nthe first issue of the Katipunan newspaper   Kalayaan \n .\n\n\nThe date and place of publication of the first issue was January 1896\nat Yokohama, Japan to mislead the Spanish authorities but it actually came\nout in mid-March 1896 and was printed in Manila. \n\n \n\nHistorians like Teodoro Agoncillo and Isagani Medina  believed that Bonifacio 's manifesto already addressed the\nentire archipelago when he used the terms \" \" Tagalog &rdquo;\n\" and \" \" Katagalugan. &rdquo; \"\n\n\nAgoncillo ( 1963: 2-3) specifically translated Bonifacio 's manifesto\nas \" \" What the Filipinos Should Know. &rdquo; \"\n\n\nThe only justification for this interpretation was a footnote in one\nof the works of Emilio Jacinto,  \" Katipunan ng mga A. N. B.\n&rdquo;  and subtitled  \" Sa May Nasang Makisanib sa\nKatipunang Ito. &rdquo; \n\n\nThe footnote ( Jacinto 1935:60; see Guerrero, Encarnacion, and\nVillegas 1996: 5-6; Reyes 1996: 22) reads:    Sa salitang\ntagalog katutura'y ang lahat ng tumubo sa Sangkapuluang ito, sa makatuid,\nbisaya man, iloko man, kapangpangan man, etc. ay tagalog din. \n  (  The word Tagalog refers to all natives of the\narchipelago; in other words, Bisayans, Ilokanos, Pampangue&ntilde;os, etc.\nare all Tagalogs  .)\n\n\nIt is important to ascertain when the article was actually written.\n\n\nAgoncillo did not provide any categorical answer.\n\n\nHe simply assumed that the article, or even the idea of Katagalugan,\nin the context of his writings, came very much earlier than the appearance of\nBonifacio 's manifesto in  Kalayaan  .\n\n\nSo far, there is no documentary evidence on this. \n\n \n\nThe  Katipunan  was established on 7 July 1892 and\nJacinto became a member in 1893 when he was eighteen years old.\n\n\nIt took time before he became a fluent speaker of Tagalog since he\nspoke fluently what was known as  \" Kastilang tindahan &rdquo;\n ( Santos 1935: 13). \n\n \n\nWe have no evidence that Jacinto wrote the article, \n\" Katipunan ng mga A(nak) N(g) B(ayan) &rdquo;  ( the Katipunan\n kartilya  ) prior to March 1896, the appearance of the\nnewspaper   Kalayaan   .\n\n\nIn all likelihood, he wrote it after the publication of Bonifacio 's\nmanifesto in   Kalayaan   .\n\n\nJohn R. M. Taylor ( 1971, I: 215-16), who published the five-volume\nwork on the Philippine insurgent records entitled \" \" The\nPhilippine Insurrection Against the United States, &rdquo; \" said\nthat Jacinto 's article was written in 1896.\n\n\nGuerrero  et al.  ( 1996: 5) confirmed this by\nsaying that the  Katipunan   Cartilla  was\n\" Written and published in 1896... &rdquo;\n\n\nSince that article was not published in the first issue of \n Kalayaan   , it must probably be written after the\npublication of the first issue.\n\n\nWhat is interesting in Taylor 's English translation of Jacinto 's\narticle is that there was no mention of \" \" Tagalog &rdquo;\n\" and definitely there was no footnote explaining the use of the\nterm \" Tagalog \" . \n\n \n\nAssuming that this footnote was not an addition and was\noriginally there in the Tagalog article, and assuming that Taylor himself\nsimply omitted the word \" Tagalog \" and the footnote, and\nreplaced them with the phrase \" \" all Filipinos &rdquo;\n\" ( 1971: 216), there is still a need to find a justification why\nJacinto made it a point to explain the term \" Tagalog \" to\nmean natives of the entire archipelago in a footnote. \n\n \n\nThe theory I forwarded in two articles, \" \"\nBonifacio the translator: a critique, &rdquo; \" which appeared in\n  Kinaadman   in 1987 ( 42-56) and  \"\nPagbabalik-tanaw sa pilosopiya ng rebolusyon ni Andres Bonifacio, &rdquo;\n which was published in the book   Katipunan: Isang\npambansang kilusan   , edited by Ferdinand Llanes ( 1994:105-15;\nsee also Gripaldo 1995:51-52) of the University of the Philippines, is that\nBonifacio wrote his manifesto only for the Tagalog tribe because he wanted to\nhave a core of revolutionists.\n\n\nJacinto later on was compelled to extend the meaning of the term\n\" Tagalog \" to include all natives of the archipelago\nbecause of the surge of applicants for membership to the  Katipunan\n society from all types of tribes after the distribution of \n Kalayaan   , which contained the philosophies of\nrevolution of Bonifacio and Jacinto. \n\n \n\nNotice that from 7 July 1892 to mid-March 1896, the appearance of\nthe first issue of   Kalayaan   , or three years and\nnine months after the establishment of the  Katipunan  , there\nwere only approximately 300  Katipunan  members.\n\n\nIf Bonifacio wanted to refer by \" \" Tagalog &rdquo;\n\" and \" \" Katagalugan &rdquo; \" to \"\nthe natives of all Philippine tribes &rdquo; and to the whole archipelago,\nrespectively, he should have already made this explanation in his manifesto\nbecause ( 1) of the significance of its content ( it was actually his\nphilosophy of revolution) and ( 2) he knew beforehand that there were members\nof the  Katipunan  who were non-Tagalogs like Valentin Diaz,\nan Ilokano, and Candido Iban and Francisco del Castillo, both Bisayans, among\nothers.\n\n\nHe must have therefore limited his manifesto to the Tagalog tribe.\n\n\nFrom mid-March 1896 to 19 August 1896 when the  Katipunan\n was discovered, a matter of five months, the membership jumped to\nabout 30,000.\n\n\nLater estimates make it even up to 400,000  Katipunan \nmembers ( Guerrero et al. 1996:4).\n\n\nIn all probability, non-Tagalog migrants who lived in Tondo and\nnearby places ( see note 6 below), who had read   Kalayaan\n  , decided to join the  Katipunan  .\n\n\nJacinto was therefore constrained to expand the meaning of the term\n\" Tagalog \" when he wrote the  \" Katipunan ng\nmga A. N. B., &rdquo;  which was intended for those who may want to\njoin the secret revolutionary society.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "1bf9efc0-1424-4c85-a407-b0a0b3a91f31", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.176492+00:00"}
{"text": "Ecological Concerns in a Modern Presentation of the Mystery\nof Creation  \n\n\n Joselito Alviar \n\n \n\nConcern for ecology is one of the signs of our times.\n\n\nMan, through scientific and technological progress, has rendered\nhimself capable of transforming his habitat to a degree hitherto\nunimaginable.\n\n\nHe has become, not just one more species inhabiting the earth, but\nrather one that consciously and decisively determines the planet 's fate (\nfor good or bad).\n\n\nThe perception of the magnitude and depth of impact on the world has\nled man to appreciate more keenly his relatedness to nature, and to become\nwary of his cumulative effect upon it.\n\n\nThat, essentially, is what ecological concern is all about. \n\n \n\nThis concern, though having its origin in highly industrialized\nnations, has reached other areas of the globe as well, particularly those\ncountries which, like the Philippines, have a plethora of natural resources\nin danger of depletion.\n\n\nIt is not surprising that the Second Plenary Council of the\nPhilippines [ PCP-II] should include a section on ecology in its final \nDecree  , stating:  \" The Church, through the initiatives\nof the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines [ CBCP], should develop\na comprehensive theology of stewardship and, in the light of this theology,\nshould make ecology a special concern of the social action apostolate down to\nthe parochial level, with the end in view of making everyone a true steward\nof God 's creation. &rdquo;   \n\n \n\nIn these brief but pithy lines the PCP II maps out not just a\ncourse of pastoral action, but also a trajectory for theological reflection.\n\n\nIndeed, effective solutions to the ecological problem may be achieved\nonly if the question is analyzed down to its deepest roots.\n\n\nThat means taking into account a number of facts about the cosmos,\nman, and history, which are told us by Revelation: particularly, the divine\norigin of man and the world; the specific role of man in the universe; and\nthe historical facts of sin and redemption.\n\n\nOnly when these truths are taken into account may a comprehensive\nanswer to the ecological problem be formulated.\n\n\nThe solution cannot consist in a purely technological measure; it\nwill, as we shall see, necessarily imply a moral effort. \n\n \n\nIt is the purpose of the present article, following the idea of\nPCP II, to suggest a basic theological framework for reflection on the\necological issue.\n\n\nA suitable context for such reflection, we believe, is offered by the\nChristian doctrine on creation. \n\n\n  A Christian View of Nature  \n\n \n\n  In the beginning God created the heavens and the\nearth.   \n\n\nThis rotund, opening affirmation of the Bible immediately situates\nthe world, together with man, within a fundamental theological context, which\nthe sacred books will describe with progressive richness.\n\n\nScripture decidedly declares the creatural, contingent character of\nall finite being: everything that exists outside of God has been drawn by Him\nfrom absolute nothingness, through a divine act of wisdom, power and\ngoodness.\n\n\nThis vision of the world 's origin is far removed from other,\nnon-Christian views which, awed by the cosmic mystery, assign to the universe\na divine nature: this \" All &rdquo; must be God himself, they think (\npantheism); or is an effusion of the divine substance ( emanatism); in any\ncase, to the whole or its parts religious veneration and cult are due.\n\n\n( Elements of this cosmic-religious tendency survive even in our day\nin the New Age Movement, in which - - as Pope John Paul II reminded U.S.\nBishops in a 1993 discourse - - the idea of personal responsibility before\nGod is displaced by vague sense of duty towards the cosmos  ) .\n\n\nThe revealed datum de-divinizes and de-mythologizes the universe, by\nuncovering, underneath its impressive vastness and apparent solidity, an\noriginal, yawning abyss of \" nothingness. &rdquo; \n\n \n\nAt the same time, revelation tells man that he cannot despise the\nworld.\n\n\nHe should, in fact, adopt an attitude of wonder before the handiwork\nof God.\n\n\nThe disposition of reverent contemplation is expressed in Psalms like\n18, 103, and 148, and has been deeply felt by Christians such as St. Francis\nof Assisi and St. Philip Neri.\n\n\nThis attitude implies a special type of wonder and awe, for it does\nnot imply subjugation to a \" deified &rdquo; cosmos but rather loving\nrespect towards a Creator 's masterpiece. \n\n \n\n  God saw all the things that he made, and they were\nvery good.   \n\n\nThe human being, before a universe filled with marvellous laws,\ncannot but feel himself inclined to share in this first, primordial, positive\nglance of creation.\n\n\nHe is led to value his world as one gifted with consistency and\nmeaning, and consequently as a reality worthy of respect and study.  5\n\n\n\nHe cannot simply reject the created universe as an enemy or obstacle\nin his search for God ( as some excessively \" spiritualistic &rdquo;\nminds might think), nor as something wholly devoid of interest; on the\ncontrary: the cosmos, with its myriad vestiges of a Maker, validly appears as\na place of possible encounter with God.  \n\n \n\nThe Christian faith sees through the cosmos, to a transcendent\nBeing, to which all creation is linked by causal bonds of power,\nintelligence, and love.\n\n\nSuch a view is far removed from the secularized visions of the\nuniverse, which conceive it as some sort of rootless and drifting \"\norphan\", a thing without origin, course, or destiny.\n\n\nIt may be eternal, some way - - but belongs to no One ...\n\n\nPerhaps it did begin in time, with a bang ( or oscillates eternally\nbetween the states of nothingness and somethingness) - - but has no Author\nnor Cause...\n\n\nIn any case, a desolate picture. \n\n\n  Man 's Role in the Universe  \n\n \n\nThe human being, an integral part of the universe, is a creature,\ntoo, and shares the experience of fragility with the rest of beings.\n\n\nRevelation, however, tells him that he holds a special place within\nthe whole, and that he must fulfill a specific function in the universe. \n\n \n\nThe first chapter of Genesis narrates a progressive sequence\nwherein creatures appear in \" ascending &rdquo; order.\n\n\nMan 's apparition is situated in the last ( sixth) day of the\ncreation account, and is portrayed as the climactic moment of the sequence.\n\n\nThe human being is created by God according to His \" image and\nlikeness, &rdquo;  and receives this mandate: \n \" Increase and multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. &rdquo;\n   \n\n \n\nThe creation of man thus appears in continuity with that of the\nrest of creatures; but this peculiar creation account indicates that the\nhuman being cannot be considered as simply and wholly \" homogeneous\n&rdquo; with the rest of creation. \n\n\nHe, and only he ( a \" person\"), enjoys special reference to the\nMaker.\n\n\nThis perspective differentiates the Christian faith from other\nanthropological conceptions, which count man as simply one more animal ( more\ndeveloped, certainly); or which reclaim animal rights equal to ( or even\ngreater than) those of men. \n\n \n\nThe narrative of the creation of man and woman in the second\nchapter of Genesis likewise contains an indication of the human being 's\nprivileged place and role within creation.\n\n\nIt states that Yahweh  put man into the paradise of pleasure,\nto dress it, and to keep it,   and that He\npresented all the animals to man  to see what he would call them.\n\n\n\nThis double biblical expression of man 's unique grasp and control of\nthe reality that surrounds him indicates that the Creator has bestowed upon\nman an ontological and functional superiority over all creatures. \n\n \n\nNow, the dominion that God expects man to exercise over the\nuniverse is of a specific kind, which has been felicitously defined as a\n\" \" stewardship &rdquo; \" : \n\n \n\n1) It does not mean absolute dominion, since man is not the\nradical Source of things.\n\n\nHe must consider the world as a gift, entrusted by God to his care.\n\n\nHe is under obligation to employ that gift correctly, in accord with\nthe Giver 's will.\n\n\nThus man, created according to the divine likeness, should act as God 's\nrepresentative.\n\n\nHe cannot dispose of creation in an irresponsible, arbitrary, or\ndespotic manner ( for example by unleashing effects so deleterious upon the\nenvironment as the massive release of toxic wastes, or the wanton\nexploitation of irreplaceable natural resources). \n\n \n\n2) Man 's dominion over created beings cannot constitute a wholly\nautonomous activity, \" subtracted &rdquo; from God 's sphere ( as\ndeists and philosophers of the Enlightenment might suggest).\n\n\nNeither man nor world may be conceived in absolute independence from\nthe Maker.\n\n\n( God himself does not forget about his handiwork, but rather\nconstantly unfolds his loving designs for creatures ' bliss).\n\n\nThe practical consequence of this is plain: man 's action upon nature\nmust assume the forms of subordination to God 's design and cooperation with\nHis creative action. \n\n \n\n3) Dominion and power over the rest of creatures may be\nconceived, besides, from the perspective of man as  \" priest of\nall creation.\"  \n\n\nThe material universe achieves its culmination in the human being,\nand through him finds a voice to praise its Creator freely. \n\n\nMan has the mission of so ordering nature that it may fulfill its\nprimordial function of manifesting the divine perfection.\n\n\nIncorporating the cosmos in his own adoration and praise, man\nelevates it above itself and lets the universe render God a glory which,\nalone, it cannot give. \n\n \n\nIt becomes clear from the foregoing exposition, that the\nChristian doctrine on creation provides man with a basic orientation as to\nthe noble part he must play in the cosmos, and at the same time indicates\nlimits to his dominion over nature. \n\n\n  Disruption of Sin; Restoration in Christ  \n\n \n\nRevelation supplies one more relevant datum, namely sin 's entry\ninto human history.\n\n\nMan, in breaking his friendship with God, has introduced a lack of\nharmony, both within himself and in his relations with other creatures.\n\n\nIt is now difficult for him to handle creatures with total rectitude\nof intention and respect for God 's plans.\n\n\nThe whole of creation, according to St. Paul, is subject to vanity,\nand groans and travails in birth-pangs awaiting the manifestation of the\nchildren of God.  14 \n\n\n  If man is not at peace with God, neither will the world\nitself be at peace.    \n\n \n\nIt does not require much effort to perceive the disorder which\nman, through his moral deviations, has introduced into his environment:\ndestruction of natural habitats, disappearance of species, depletion of\nforests, etc.\n\n\nBehind such tragedies often lie selfish motives and disordered\ninterests, which give higher priority to economic or power gains, over the\ngood of persons or of nature; which prefer immediate personal profit to the\ncommon good.\n\n\nThis realistic picture, of man as sinner, leads away from ingenuously\noptimistic conceptions of man, such as J.J. Rousseau 's naturalism.\n\n\nThe Christian warns us that man in his historical situation suffers\nthe debilitating effects of sin, and cannot exercise his dominion within\nhimself.\n\n\nThough he conserves his affinity for truth and good, he\nsimultaneously feels in his flesh the gravity-like pull of egoism, hedonism,\ngreed, which render arduous any moderate and reasonable behavior in using\nearthly goods. \n\n \n\nChristian revelation adds a final, hopeful datum, however, by\naffirming that salvation has come to us through Christ.\n\n\nIt is possible to overcome sin and human frailty, and shape the world\nin accordance with the divine project.\n\n\nAll things, in heaven and on earth, have been reconciled through\nChrist, pacified with the blood of his Cross. \n\n\nChrist has become the head of all  ; the\nworld, ruled previously by sin and death, has with Him begun the path towards\ndefinitive renewal. \n\n\nTime 's end will bring, not annihilation, but a renovation which will\nyield  \" a new heaven and a new earth\"   - - a divine transformation of the world as we know it into a\nfitting dwelling place for saints, resurrected and gathered complete around\nChrist. \n\n \n\nWithin this eschatologically-charged picture, man 's actual\nefforts to better the world and fashion it into a place worthy of human\ndignity are relevant. \n\n\nHumanity 's noble, hard-won gains in the actual stage of salvation\nhistory will not be swept away in the end, but will rather be conserved,\npurified, eternalized, at the final consummation.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "81c2642d-2c6f-492b-ae91-7c5e3723824b", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.178318+00:00"}
{"text": "INTRODUCTION  \n\n \n\nTo derive the most from Asian philosophy, it is imperative to\nassume an attitude which I call an  attitudinal imperative  - - and\nthis is  to understand  .\n\n\nIn understanding, one must put away all complexes, whether of\nsuperiority or of inferiority.\n\n\nOlivier Lacombe, long recognized as an authority on Indian philosophy,\nis emphatic on this point - -  \" Away with inferiority and\nsuperiority complexes, the cancers of sick minds. &rdquo;  \n\n\nAnd Lacombe continues that  \" more deeply than our\nquality of being oriental or occidental is our quality of being human.\n&rdquo;  \n\n\nLacombe says that our lack of understanding stems from the fact that\nwe have tarried on the surface of ourselves, implying that we have missed the\nessential and the deeply human. \n\n \n\n \" The universality of human nature implies the power\nand the duty to communicate from one culture to another, &rdquo;  and\nhence, whether we are from the East or from the West, we can penetrate into\nthe core of human nature and there discover essentials.\n\n\nOn the depth-level of human nature, Lacombe seems to tell us that\nthere are no differences anymore.\n\n\nIf on the surface we appear to be dissimilar, this is only because we\nhave stayed on the peripheral level.\n\n\nThe truth is that the similarities among men are more real than\napparent. \n\n \n\nThere are, however, gross differences between East and West which\nshould be accepted as axiomatic from the very start. \n\n \n\nFirst, the Western mind thinks in a linear manner.\n\n\nThe Occidental man invariably thinks in terms of time, as beginning\nand end, and his concept of eternity is but an extension of the end to an\ninvisible no-end, and of the beginning, into an unknown no-beginning.\n\n\nThe Asian, on the other hand, thinks of time in a cyclic manner.\n\n\nFor him, the beginning and end of events or of individuals are but\nlinks in a chain of beginning-ends where the end of one immediately gives\nrise to another beginning in a perpetual manner.\n\n\nNothing really ends; nothing really begins absolutely.\n\n\nOnce in existence, always in existence, and a non-existent will never\nbecome, but will remain forever in the bosom of nothingness.  \n\n \n\nThus the Western mind thinks naturally of creation at the\nbeginning of the world of things and an annihilation at the end of the same\nworld of things.\n\n\nThe Asian mind summarily dismisses absolute creation and absolute\nannihilation.\n\n\nThe fact that things exist  now  is an indication that they\nhave  always  existed.\n\n\nThey were never lifted from nothing into something by way of\ncreation, and they will never cease to be; they will always exist in a\ndifferent mode of disposition. \n\n \n\nThe concept of all-at-once-ness which is the hallmark of the mind\nof Asia is annoying to the Western mind which cannot shake off its structural\nmode of thinking in terms of beginning and end, of before and after, of then\nand now and later.\n\n\nThis is no doubt applicable to individual things and events which the\nAsian mind does not reject, but when the line of reasoning and understanding\nis raised from the fragmentary to the total, from the piecemeal to the whole,\nfrom the part to the All of the world of things, the Asian mind balks at the\n\" illogic &rdquo; of applying the same principles pertaining only to\nthe fragments to that of the Whole. \n\n \n\nAt the very outset, this   leitmotif \n has to be grasped well because many concepts of Asian philosophy cannot\nbe understood without it. \n\n \n\nSecond, there is no dichotomy between a way of life and a way of\nthinking in Asia.\n\n\nAs one thinks, so one lives.\n\n\nReligion, or a way of life, is not polarized from philosophy, which\nis a way of thinking.\n\n\nReligion and philosophy in Asia are one.\n\n\nNo gap exists between philosophy and life, between contemplation and\naction, between theory and practice.\n\n\nAnd this is perhaps the reason philosophical theory had not soared as\nhigh as it did and still does in the West for, commensurate to theory, the\nAsian must accomplish in practice, which is not easy.\n\n\nThe West has but to theorize and speculate; no application to life is\nnecessary.\n\n\nSuch are the Platonic, Hegelian, Kantian, Fichtean theories to which\nthe Western philosophers render lip service; their application to practice is\nstill being contested by other Western philosophers. \n\n \n\nThis is at once a boon as it is a setback.\n\n\nBy being allowed to speculate and soar into the skies of theory and\nhypothesis, one discovers new vistas, new horizons, new perspectives, whereas\nby being tied down to life practices, one is necessarily held back by their\ngravitational pull.\n\n\nIs this the reason the West has continuously discovered new avenues\nof medicine, new knowledge regarding planets, new ways of multiplying harvest\nas against the paucity in the East of the same blessings?\n\n\nThis is, however, also a setback.\n\n\nThe cleavage between theory and practice, between philosophy and\nlife, between a hypothesis and its application leads to frustration and to a\nsplit-level personality.\n\n\nOne has to make do with a bundle of theories, beautiful to behold but\nhollow and meaningless because inapplicable.\n\n\nWhere do we find the most unhappiness that leads to suicides and\ninsanity but in the West?\n\n\nWhat about the by-product of new scientific discoveries and\nprogressive techniques like pollution, which is a threat to humanity? \n\n \n\nThere is more peace in the Asian  psyche \nbecause of the absence of this split-level disposition but, of course, at the\nexpense of hunger and privation and grinding poverty.\n\n\nThere is no pollution except in industrialized cities, it is true,\nbut there is hardly economic progress and even philosophical advancement\neither.\n\n\nKeeping theory and practice together contributes to individual peace\nof mind, for one experiences no anguish brought about by a dual standard; yet\nit also hampers productivity in the face of Asia 's burgeoning population.\n\n\n \n\nReligion in Asia is a way of life; it is sacrosanct.\n\n\nIt is not accurate to judge that Asia is poor because of religion.\n\n\nIt is poor because it cannot accept the polarization of theory and\npractice, of philosophy and religion, of its way of thinking and its way of\nliving.\n\n\nIf Asia could find a means of adjusting elusive theory with practice,\nthere is no reason why Asia cannot become progressive like the West.\n\n\nThis, of course, is an ideal. \n\n \n\nThirdly, the Asian mind resorts to intuition, if logic is no\nlonger able to solve a life problem.\n\n\nFrom the very fact that it thinks in a cyclic all-at-once-ness, it\nmust resort to means other than the usual mental processes applicable to the\npiecemeal and fragmentary.\n\n\nOne should not therefore be surprised at its propensity to mysticism,\nat its use of super-consciousness, or of the existence of a third eye or a\nsixth sense.\n\n\nWhen the situation so demands, it reverses the logical patterns. \n\n\n  THE MERGING CURRENTS: A DIFFERENT APPROACH  \n\n \n\nIf one were to use the systematic approach of the seven\ndisciplines in Western philosophy, namely psychology, ethics, theodicy,\nepistemology, metaphysics, cosmology and logic, as bases of comparison\nbetween Asian and Western philosophy, one would easily discern further\nsimilarities and differences. \n\n\n  A. PSYCHOLOGY  \n\n \n\n1. In  psychology  , or the study of human nature, Asian\nand Western thinkers have different perceptions regarding man.\n\n\nIn the West, man is looked upon as an individual, special and unique,\nwith definite specifications.\n\n\nThis individuality is based upon a personal set of characteristics\nemanating from a soul that is his and his alone. \n\n \n\nIn Asia, man is looked upon as a speck in the universe of things;\nhence, he does not possess the importance accorded him by the West.\n\n\nHis existence is merely a continuation of another existence in a long\nand continuous chain of existence. \n\n \n\nFrom the etymology   psyche   meaning\n\" soul &rdquo; and   logos   meaning\n\" word, &rdquo; one can gather that the Western preoccupation is the\nduality of man.\n\n\nBody and soul are the two components of the human person with the\ndifficulty of tying these two components into a single unity.\n\n\nThis is not always easy because one component is a material body and\nthe other is a spiritual soul. \n\n \n\nAll throughout the history of philosophy, this unity in duality\nhas always posed a problem.\n\n\nPlato did not attempt to conjoin them.\n\n\nHe said that the soul of man inhabited the World of Ideas \" up\nabove the heavens &rdquo; while his body inhabited the sensible world below,\nso that when the soul descended into the body for some unknown reason ( \nPhaedrus  ) , the soul started to forget what it used to know.\n\n\nThe body could only be looked upon as a sort of prison responsible\nfor pushing into oblivion those ideas or knowledge that the soul had known\nwhile it was in the World of Ideas.\n\n\nPlato never taught an indissoluble union between body and soul. \n\n \n\nAristotle did conjoin the body and soul of man in his Hylemorphic\n( from   hyle   meaning \" matter\", and \n morphe   meaning \" form\") Doctrine.\n\n\nHe said that every being was made up of matter and form. \n\n \n\nA table has its matter and form.\n\n\nMatter can be of two kinds: prime or primary and secondary matter.\n\n\nPrime or primary matter is the ingredient in all beings.\n\n\nIt cannot be created nor annihilated since it is a substratum, an\nunderlying substrate in all things.\n\n\nSecondary matter is what is perceived as colored, textured, shaped.\n\n\nThe table 's secondary matter is its own bulk and weight, which can\nbe perceived by any of man 's five external senses.\n\n\nSecondary matter can and does undergo changes.\n\n\nThe table can be re-shaped, shortened, re-painted.\n\n\nIn this case, its form undergoes accidental changes such as from one\ncolor to another, from one shape to another, from one size to another. \n\n \n\nThe table can also burn, in which case, a drastic change takes\nplace.\n\n\nFrom the table, which is perceived, emerges another substance, called\n\" ashes \" , which has an entirely different form.\n\n\nIn this case, it would seem that the substance table was annihilated\nand in its place was created a new substance called \" ashes\n\" . \n\n \n\nAristotle 's Hylemorphic Doctrine similarly applies to the human\nbeing.\n\n\nThe human person is made up of matter ( namely, the body), and the\nform ( namely, the soul).\n\n\nThe body and soul together constitute the human being.\n\n\nTo Aristotle, contrary to Plato, the body is just as important as the\nsoul as a component of man.\n\n\nIf for Plato, the body is like a prison or a glass case that cuts\ndown the brilliance exuded by a candle - - in either case, a liability, for\nAristotle, the body is necessary if only in the acquisition of knowledge.\n\n\nAristotle believed that man 's soul at the moment of birth is a \n tabula rasa   , or a blank tablet, and the only way\nto fill up this blank tablet is to allow the outside world to penetrate by\nmeans of the bodily senses.\n\n\n \" There is nothing in the mind without having been in\nthe senses &rdquo;  is an important doctrine of Aristotle.\n\n\nThe only way to form ideas is by way of the senses gathering data\nfrom outside reality.\n\n\nHence, the body is necessary as a contact point between the soul and\nthe material world. \n\n \n\nThis argument, however, will not be as convenient for proving the\nimmortality of the soul.\n\n\nWhen man dies, would the soul die as well as the body?\n\n\nThe answer given is that the body dies but the soul does not.\n\n\nTwo proofs are given.\n\n\nOne is that of simplicity.\n\n\nThe soul is simple, i.e., it has no parts.\n\n\nIf death means the disintegration of parts, then the soul cannot die\nbecause it has no parts to disintegrate.\n\n\nThe other proof is based on spirituality.\n\n\nThe soul is spiritual, i.e., it is non-material.\n\n\nThis argument is based on the principle of   \nAgere sequitur esse    - -  \" Action\nfollows essence. &rdquo;  As the product is, so is its source.\n\n\nAs the fruit is, so its source is a fruit tree.\n\n\nMan has spiritual activities like thinking and willing and therefore\nman must have a spiritual component responsible for them.\n\n\nThe body is not spiritual.\n\n\nHence, it is the soul which is the source of all spiritual\nactivities.\n\n\nA spiritual being,   per se   , is\nimmortal ( the word \" mortal &rdquo; comes from the Latin \n mors   meaning death, and the addition of the\n\" im &rdquo; negates death, hence immortal means \" not capable of\ndying\").\n\n\nTherefore, the soul of man is immortal; it will outlive the body\nafter the latter dies. \n\n \n\nIn the East, there is no difficulty in proving immortality.\n\n\nTo begin with, Eastern philosophers do not put any emphasis on the\nduality of man 's nature.\n\n\nMan is one  self  .\n\n\nThis self is the   atman   and is the\nseat of consciousness.\n\n\nThe  atman  is man 's deepest selfhood where man\nis truly man.\n\n\nConsciousness is never turned off even in sleep.\n\n\nThere might be levels of consciousness from man 's wakefulness to\nman 's deepest sleep but this consciousness is never shut off.\n\n\nAn argument is that during sleep, man dreams, which is not possible\nwithout a modicum of consciousness.\n\n\nIf so, even beyond death, this consciousness continues to exist\nbecause it does not depend on the body but rather on the  atman\n . \n\n \n\n2. The concept of freedom is another point of divergence in the\nEast and West.\n\n\nIn the West, freedom is such a valuable commodity that all of man 's\nvalues center on this concept.\n\n\nGuilt, responsibility, retribution, the noble and the ignoble,\ndepend upon freedom.\n\n\nNo ethics is possible without freedom as a   sine qua\nnon   .\n\n\nJustice cannot be meted out without ascertaining the existence of\nfreedom.\n\n\nThe Westerner prides himself in enjoying freedom to the point that\nhe has built his philosophies around this concept. \n\n \n\nIn the East, freedom does not merit any attention, nor is there\nany lengthy discussion on freedom in any of the Eastern writings.\n\n\nIntention and freedom are ruled out in the meting out of\nretribution.\n\n\nThe reason could lie in the lack of freedom surrounding man 's\nbirth.\n\n\nIndeed, counsel, advice and justice are founded on freedom, but of\nwhat use are these when man is not free regarding his birth?\n\n\nMan is just born  without having been consulted  as\nthe Existentialists say.\n\n\nMan therefore has no choice of parents, place and date of birth,\nbodily feature, mental power, physical capacity, etc.\n\n\nHence, when he is born into this world, his goals, ambitions,\ndesires, and propensities are already laid out by circumstances of his birth.\n\n\nWhat than is the fuss over man 's freedom when he is not free\nregarding the initial moment of his life?", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "1a521b1c-414a-4615-bc92-ffead35aab23", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.179417+00:00"}
{"text": "Ethnography of Speaking: the Bikol Folk Song  \n\n\n Cynthia D. Nolasco \n\n \n\nAn observer in the Bikol region will immediately note the\ncloseness of ties between daily life and song among the people.\n\n\nThe folk sing at work, while resting, at play and in worship.\n\n\nThey sing when they are happy, when they are disappointed or\nheartbroken, when they are afraid, and when they are penitent.\n\n\nThey sing to their babies, the older children, to their lovers, their\nparents, to God and the saints.\n\n\nThere are songs sung before dawn, during the day, in the evening and\nat midnight.\n\n\nThere is a vast and varied repertoire of melodies and lyrics upon\nwhich the people draw for songs to suit both occasion and purpose for which\nsinging is appropriate. \n\n \n\nOne may be awakened long before dawn by the plaintive strains of\nthe   despierta   , a community procession around\nthe village calling on all Christians to awaken and start the day with\nprayer.\n\n\nThroughout the day, as the household goes about its routinary chores\nand activities, one may hear snatches of a tender   panhimaturog\n  or lullaby as a mother cradles the baby in her arms,\nrhythmical   pakonsuelo   sung by  Lolo\n or  Lola  to amuse the children, and a sad \n logo-logo   or song of disappointment and\nworld-weariness as a mother busies herself in the kitchen, mends clothes or\nweaves a hat when housework is done. \n\n \n\nThe chatter of the older children in the yard may be punctuated\nby their play songs or   kanta sa pag-uyag   to\naccompany a game, to tease one another, or simply to liven up their\nstory-telling.\n\n\nThey may choose to sit outside the window of the house while a\nmother, an unmarried aunt, or a grandmother, now resting from housework,\nreads from a little torn booklet and sings of far-away adventures and\nromances of the   berso   .\n\n\nOut in the ricefields, in a coconut or  abaca \nplantation, the doleful tune of a   tagulaylay   may\nbe heard as the men rest from their labors. \n\n \n\nAt day 's end when work is done, the adult men and women may\ngather informally at the neighborhood  sari-sari  store or\nsomeone 's little terrace and, over jugs of  tuba  , exchange\nlighthearted songs, the   pakonsuelo   , in praise of\ndrink or on the follies of men and women, or entertain each other through\n  inamoracion   or love songs.\n\n\nWhen there is news that a young woman has recently come to visit in\nthe barrio, the young men may, in the later hours of the evening, fetch the\nlocal   gitarista   and call on the maiden guest\nin a   harana   or serenade. \n\n \n\nOn weekend nights, a village dance may be organized and there\ncouples may dance the   pantomina   to the\nlilting melodies sung by the recognized singers of the community.\n\n\nTo provide the dancers some rest and to serve as an intermission of\nsorts, a   sumpungan   may be held where a man and a\nwoman engage in a lively courtship debate in song. \n\n \n\nThe image of the Bikolanos as merrymakers is balanced by their\nseriousness in worship.\n\n\nOn more quiet evenings, especially when the community has lately been\nbeset by some misfortune, the people may join a late evening or midnight \n perdon   , a haunting penitential procession asking\nfor divine intercession. \n\n \n\nAt Christmastime, the homes of the barrio may be visited at night\nby itinerant bands of carolers singing the   Kagharong \n , recounting Joseph and Mary 's pitiable search for a room at the inn.\n\n\nIn the daytime, small groups of boys and girls colorfully dressed as\n  pastoras   may make the rounds of the big\nhouses and neighborhood stores in town singing and dancing in celebration of\nthe Nativity. \n\n \n\nHence, we see that folksinging in the region happens under a host\nof diverse conditions.\n\n\nThe folk sing their songs in a variety of social situations and\nsettings, with a variety of singers and for a variety of purposes.\n\n\nHowever diverse these conditions are, the folk implicitly know which\nsong and which singing style accompany which purpose, which occasion, which\nphysical setting, which time of day, which type of singer or singers and\naudience, and other such elements which broadly speaking, constitute the\nfolksinging context.\n\n\nComplementarily, the folk also know which elements do not properly\nmatch or combine. \n\n \n\nTake the case of young and unmarried men ( participants) trying\nto get acquainted with a young woman visiting the barrio ( purpose).\n\n\nThey serenade her at the home of her host ( physical setting) in the\nlate hours of the evening ( time of day).\n\n\nThe folk singers select love songs ( text) from their repertoire of\nsong and sing them with tenderness ( key) to the rhythm of a guitar ( musical\ninstrument).\n\n\nThis behavior may be seen as the product of a set of choices made by\na participant with a purpose, on an activity which involves physical and\ntemporal setting, text, key, and musical instrument.\n\n\nThe nature and the outcome of the activity rest on the propriety of\nthe choices made on all items in the set.\n\n\nImproper choices made on any one of these elements can lead to\nunwanted result and thwart any hoped-for outcome of the activity.\n\n\nChanging the time of day to noontime (    \"\nMasyado naman yata kayong maaga. &rdquo;    ) , trotting\nout a small drum improvised from a milk tin instead of a guitar (  \n \" Malayo pa ang Pasko! &rdquo;    ) , or\nselecting   Tilibong, Tilibong   instead of a love\nsong (    \" Kami ba'y niloloko ninyo? &rdquo; \n  ) are examples of inappropriate choices and of unwished-for\nreactions.\n\n\nThe young men may draw laughter, derision, or perhaps pity but\nprobably not an invitation to come up and meet the young woman guest. \n\n \n\nBut had the participants been children, the time of day earlier\nin the evening, the month December, the purpose to earn a few pesos, the key\njubilant, then the milk tin for a drum would have been the appropriate choice\nof musical instrument to accompany songs on the Infant Jesus.\n\n\nThis altered configuration of elements would have defined the\nactivity to be Christmas caroling. \n\n \n\nThese examples of appropriate and inappropriate behavior indicate\nthat folksinging is not merely the act of singing songs transmitted over time\nbut rather a complex activity involving a \" correct &rdquo; text,\ncontext, participants and performance and a \" correct &rdquo;\ncombination of these elements.\n\n\nIt is a form of behavior involving choices on these components which\nare made, often unconsciously, by the folk. \n\n \n\nBroadly defined, folk songs are the songs of, for, and by the\nfolk which is  \" any group of people whatsoever who share at\nleast one common factor ( such as) occupation, language or religion &rdquo;\n ( Dundes 1965: 2).\n\n\nThese are the melodies and lyrics as well as their performance which\nare created and/or recreated by the folk, performed primarily by and among\nthemselves to accompany the daily life of the community, and expressive of a\nmeaningful personal or social or group experience. \n\n \n\nThe specific defining characteristics of folk songs are communal\nrecreation, variation, aural transmission  and\nperformance in small groups.\n\n\nCommunal recreation is the basic element which distinguishes folk\nsongs from other types of songs.\n\n\nWhile originally composed by individuals, folk songs have been and\nare acted on, re-created and re-fashioned by the community in a process of\npurposeful selection and adaptation, unlike popular songs which are taken\nover ready-made by them.\n\n\nThus folk songs are truly a communal product and possession. \n\n \n\nConsequently, they exist only as variants of the original\ncompositions whose melodies and/or lyrics, together with their authors, are\nnow perhaps forgotten.\n\n\nWhile popular songs are congealed in form, folk songs invite\nvariation in their tunes and their words. \n\n \n\nThe fluidity of the folk songs is partly due to their manner of\ntransmission, that is, without a musical score.\n\n\nThey are learned, performed from memory, and transmitted aurally from\none generation to the next and diffused from one region to another.\n\n\nAs one peasant-folksinger in Sorsogon describes their performance,\nfolk songs are sung and accompanied by a guitar set to  \" the\nkey of O,  oido  . &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nFinally, like other folklore forms, folk songs are performed\nprimarily in small groups where the participants relate to each other\ndirectly, face-to-face ( Ben-Amos 1971: 12-13), in contrast to popular songs\nwhich are played live to a mass audience in music halls or as recordings over\nthe radio and on television.\n\n\nMoreover, they are performed to accompany the day-to-day activities\nof the folk in work, play, and worship. \n\n \n\nAs for content, folk songs are one channel where the folk speak\ndirectly of their world, thought and spirit. \n\n \n\nThus has the folk song been defined in terms of its properties as\nfolk music and as verbal folklore.\n\n\nHowever, the folk song is not only these.\n\n\nBeyond its specific defining characteristics enumerated by\nmusicologists and folklorists, the folk song may also be seen as a peculiar\nform of language use for communication.\n\n\nIt has a distinctly recognizable stylistic form, talks about\ndistinctly familiar topics, is performed in a distinctly different way from\nother language acts, under distinctive conventional settings of time and\nplace, and for distinctive purposes by and among the folk. \n\n \n\nAs such it may be considered a speech genre which has\ndistinguishing properties of text, context and performance \nvis-&agrave;-vis  other genres, each of which calls for a different\nmanner of conduct and relies on different norms of interpretation. \n\n \n\nThe ethnography of speaking the Bikol folk song is a description\nand analysis of its text, context and performance and the shared conventions\ngoverning its conduct and interpretation.\n\n\nIt is a description and analysis of the rules governing the use of\nthe folk song in the Bikol region, the rules and conventions governing its\nform, its doing and performance, and setting which are intimately related to\nthe rules governing its means of interpretation.\n\n\nThere are shared conventions that distinguish it from other\nnonfolklore communicative modes, that is, through its text, its conduct or\nperformance, and the situation where it may be found. \n\n \n\nTo produce, comprehend and use  \" correct and\nwell-formed, contextually appropriate &rdquo;  folk songs, the folk\ndraw on what might be termed their folksinging competence, an implicit\nknowledge of the rules and conventions involving the text, performance and\ncontext of this verbal art. \n\n \n\nIt may be said that every folksinging performance is a\nmanifestation of this folksinging competence.\n\n\nIt involves knowing what to sing, when, where, how and why.\n\n\nIt involves for the folk who sing and re-create folk songs a\ncompetence that goes beyond the grammatical rules of the language of the\nsongs but also encompasses three other requisite aspects.\n\n\nThese are knowing the conventions of the folk song genre as a\nstylized form of speech, knowing the rules of \" reading &rdquo; the\nfolk song correctly, and knowing the rules of folk song use.\n\n\nTo elaborate:\n\n 1.   knowing the conventions of the folk song as a stylized form\nof speech   .\n\n\nIt is this knowledge which enables the folk to create and re-create\nversions of the folk song and to express their thoughts in recognizable form.\n\n\nIt is this knowledge that gives the folk such confidence and boldness\nin \" taking liberties &rdquo; with the folk song and creating their own\nversions in innumerable instances.\n\n\nFolksinging competence involves an implicit knowledge of the rules of\ntext construction, including the folk 's repertoire of topics or messages as\nwell as resources of linguistic and musical devices for making the lyrics\ncohere and the melodies and lyrics match.\n\n\nSuch competence has been observed by folklorists: \n\n\n 2.   knowing the rules of \" reading &rdquo; the folk song\ncorrectly   , in the adapted sense of Jonathan Culler 's \"\nliterary competence\": the often unconscious system of rules by which readers\nassociate not just any arbitrary meaning but rather a range of acceptable or\nappropriate meanings to a stream or body of utterances in a particular form,\nthat is, the literary piece ( 1975: 113-130).\n\n\nFolksinging competence includes the ability to associate an\nacceptable meaning or range of meanings with a folk song as mediated by the\nfolk song setting.\n\n\nIt is this competence which allows the folk, for example, to decode\nsexual undertones and otherwise taboo references in folk songs which, when\nwritten down and read, look innocuous enough for children 's ears.\n\n\nWhen sung in a riotous drinking session by the community 's adults,\nhowever, such innuendoes come to the fore and elicit the desired howls of\nlaughter and token protest.\n\n\nTo \" read &rdquo; the folk song correctly, the folk have their\nability to recognize and pick up clues provided by its context, both\nimmediate and remote, and thus decode messages. \n\n \n\nA folk song 's immediate context or its \" context of\nsituation &rdquo; are those elements which accompany its performance such as\nthe participants, setting, manner of interaction between singer and audience,\nand key or tone of performance.\n\n\nThe remote context refers to what is called \" \" context\nof culture &rdquo; \" , the material and non-material elements which\nmake up the world of the folk as well as their outlook towards it, their\nideas, beliefs, concerns, attitudes and values.\n\n\nThe ideal folk song singer/listener brings this broad knowledge and\noutlook into the folksinging event so that the folk song is encoded and\ndecoded according to the shared rules of interpretation.", "subdomain":

{"text": "The Dialectics of Transnational Shame and National Identity\n \n\n\n Filomeno V. Aguilar, Jr.  \n\n \n\nBetter opportunities in a new place, separation from family and\ncommunity, marital dissolution, emotional attachment between server and\nserved: these themes could well be those of today 's Filipino overseas\ncontract workers ( OCWs), and the statements cited above could well have been\nuttered in the context of present-day international labor migration.\n\n\nBut, in fact, they belong to a different era.\n\n\nAppearing in the admirable study by James Warren ( 1981) from where I\nhad culled the above extracts, these statements were recorded in the context\nof the slave raiding and slave-master relationship as practiced by the Sulu\nSultanate in the late nineteenth century.\n\n\nThe slave workers in Sulu 's external-trade driven economy were\ncaptured from various parts subsumed in what today we call \"\nSoutheast Asia \" - - Ilocos, Cavite, Cebu, Catanduanes, Albay,\nSamar, Iloilo, Menado, Gorontalo, Bugis, Moluccas, Makassar, Kelantan,\nPatani, etc. - - and forcibly brought to the Sulu zone.\n\n\nAs coerced migrants, the Sulu slaves spent a life of captivity\nvestiges of which may be observed in the contemporary OCW phenomenon ( cf.\nHing this volume).\n\n\nCertainly, Sulu 's slavery and present-day contract labor migration\nshare a common ancestry in global capitalism, albeit issuing from different\nstages of its revolution.\n\n\nBut one aspect that was conspicuously absent in the reports of roughly\na century ago was the sense of national identity on the part of the slaves.\n\n\nAbducted from various parts of the Philippines and island Southeast\nAsia, they were treated equally as   banyaga   ( \"\nchattel-slaves\", Warren 1981:215).\n\n\nThe slaves themselves did not express their social identities in the\nanachronistic categories of \" 'Filipino', 'Indonesian', 'malaysian',\nor 'Thai' \" .\n\n\nWhatever geographic attachments they cherished were limited to the\nhighly specific entities of family or village or to the ports or townships\nfrom where they had originated.\n\n\nEthnic identities were then extremely fluid in Sulu as elsewhere in\nthe region. \n\n \n\nOf the innumerable quotes cited by Warren, only one referring to\na Spaniard betrayed any identification with a nation:   \" The\nSpaniard had lived for fifteen years in the interior of [ Sulu], where his\nmaster treated him very well, and his only reason for escaping was an\nunconquerable yearning to behold his native country once again &rdquo;\n  ( Warren 1981:250).\n\n\nI find this brief quote suggestive of the man 's sense of territorial\nbond with his homeland, the nativeness of which became even clearer and\ndearer to him from the remoteness of his captivity in Sulu.\n\n\nBut in longing to see his literal country and not necessarily those\ndear to him ( who might not be traceable after fifteen years, or whose lives\nmight have taken a course with which he would not be happy), his cognitive\nnation was characterized by the erasure of people.\n\n\nBut the physical terrain of his land of birth was different for,\ndespite the years of separation, it could be imagined as unchanging and\neternally welcoming, probably buttressed by the vision of a map that remained\nvivid in his memory, his native land thus becoming the object of the fondest\nyearning.\n\n\nThe Spanish slave 's love of nation as expressed in the naturalistic\nvocabulary of the homeland, following Benedict Anderson 's ( 1991:142-4)\nargument, is rather analogous to Jose Rizal 's   patria\n  in his \"   Ultimo Adios  \n\" in which the great patriot, while awaiting his execution, said his\nmoving farewell to a nation literally of land and sea.\n\n\nApart from this Spaniard, however, the reports on the other slaves in\nthe Sulu Sultanate quoted by Warren showed no affective ties to a modern\nnation.\n\n\nAlso markedly absent was any personal or collective feeling of shame\nat their enslavement.\n\n\nOn the contrary, it was not unusual for slaves to feel contented at\nthe fair treatment they received and to relish the material advantages they\nreaped from their forced migration. \n\n \n\nAt about the same period of history, however, at the other side\nof the globe the young and wealthy   ilustrados  \nfrom the Spanish Philippines who lived in Europe, mainly to obtain a\nuniversity degree, were displaying passions that were undoubtedly tied to an\nemergent nationhood.\n\n\nA number of newspapers in Spain printed articles the  \nilustrados   found offensive and insulting not just to their\nindividual persons but to a collectivity - - the 'Filipino people', \n los indios bravos   - - with whom the mainly Chinese\n mestizo    ilustrados  \nidentified ( cf. Schumacher 1973:55-56, 213-6).\n\n\nFor instance, the Filipino was pictured as  \" no more\nthan a big child...lacking even the beard which is the sign of virility in a\nrace &rdquo;  , and his supposed racial inferiority was further\nunderscored:   \" What does the poor   indio\n  , weak in body and weak in mind...understand of all this\nchatter of motherhood and brotherhood, of civilization and of culture?\n\n\n...Bodies without clothes, brains without ideas...an inanimate heap\nof human entities... &rdquo;   (   Ibid. \n .:56). \n\n \n\nIn response to one such slew of invectives, Antonio Luna, after\nfailing to obtain the right to reply to a \" series of insults &rdquo;\nfrom a Spanish writer, recounted in a letter addressed to Rizal dated 26\nNovember 1889 that he  \" felt the compelling need to look for\nMir Deas and spit on his face &rdquo;  ( Terra 1996).\n\n\nLuna 's letter reported that:\n\n  Upon finding him, I asked who he was ( as I did not know him), I\ntold him he was dishonourable, a coward, a despicable low-life. \n\n\nI spat at him, then flung my calling card on his bespattered face.\n\n\nThe result: a lot of disorder, confusion and riot...  \n\n \n\n\nThe series of insults which he directed at me asked for no other\nreply than what I did.\n\n\nWith luck, I hope he accepts my challenge to a duel....\n\n\nIn this way, I would like to show that we Filipinos have more honour\nthan the cringeing [ sic], grovelling ... coward...  \n\n  I think I am satisfied that by doing this our dignity would be\nenhanced...    This is called for, it is unavoidable if he\ncontinues to malign the good name of the Filipino   ( \n Ibid.   ) .\n\n \n\nAfter making an appeal to Rizal and other compatriots then in\nParis ( whom he expected would be reading his letter) to support their own\npaper, the   La Solidaridad   , by taking out\nsubscriptions, Luna 's last line read:   \" Greetings to all\nand share the news with our fellow countrymen &rdquo;   ( \n Ibid.   ) .\n\n\nClearly, the expatriate Luna like Rizal had cultivated the national\nimagination: shared by these   ilustrado   exiles\nwas the conception of a community, an anonymous mass of countrymen linked by\na common land of birth.\n\n\nMore than that, these fellow sojourners in Europe were imagined as\nsharing the same sentiment of revulsion at the racial slurs that maligned\n\" the good name of the Filipino. &rdquo; Luna could probably envisage\nhis countrymen identifying with his bruised feelings and cheering him on for\nthe feat of bravery and retribution he had singlehandedly achieved on behalf\nof them all.\n\n\nHence his reminder to Rizal to  \" share the news.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThe Sulu slaves and the   ilustrados \n demonstrate contrasting patterns of migration and nationalism in the\nlate nineteenth century.\n\n\nThe early Philippine nationalists reacted to the felt humiliation at\nthe racial abuse of an inchoate collectivity they believed defined their\nsocial identity.\n\n\nAmong the peripatetic elements of the native intelligentsia, the\nfeeling was most acute in the imperial metropole where they aspired to prove\ntheir parity with and gain acceptance from the colonial overlords.\n\n\nThe insults that negated such aspirations seemed to have strengthened\nthe perception of separateness and difference, as well as the resolve to\ndefend the dignity and honor of the Filipino as defined by the  \nilustrados   .\n\n\nFrom its early beginnings Philippine elite nationalism was thus\nintertwined with colonial racism, resulting in a profound sensitivity to the\nshaming of the nation-cum-race and in an insecurity borne of the Filipino\n mestizo  elite 's internalization of such racism (\nAguilar 1995).\n\n\nIn contrast, the fishermen, peasants and artisans enslaved in Sulu at\nthe same historical period were positively unaffected by any notion of\nnationalism.\n\n\nBut neither were the   ilustrados  \nconcerned about the Sulu social system which was virtually unlinked to the\nelite 's concept of the nation. \n\n \n\nAt the close of the twentieth century, the embeddedness of\nnationalism in migratory movements is unravelling in new dimensions.\n\n\nEducated Filipinos overseas of middle and upper class extraction - -\nregardless of political persuasion - - are anxious that the Filipino diaspora\nhas compromised what they perceive to be the dignity and honor of the nation.\n\n\nSome elite nationalists outrightly refer to the OCW phenomenon as an\nembarrassment to the nation.\n\n\nWriting from New York, Ninotchka Rosca calls the participation of\nFilipinas in the international labor market as the Philippines ' \"\n\" shameful export &rdquo; \" ( Rosca 1995).\n\n\nHow I came across Luna 's letter is instructive of other elite\nattempts to come to terms with bruised national feelings.\n\n\nIn a news feature entitled \" \" Bad Press, 19th Century\n&rdquo; \" that appeared in \"  The Filipino  \" (\npublished in London with a readership in other parts of Europe), Luna 's\nletter was quoted in full, but in its English translation, precisely to\nencourage  \" Filipinos in Europe [ who] are regular recipients\nof deprecating, racist and abusive coverage by the media, whether it be in\nthe news, documentaries or comedy skits &rdquo;  ( Terra 1996).\n\n\nThe aim was to reawaken the spirit of Luna among the paper 's largely\nmiddle-class readership most of whom merely \" endure &rdquo; the\n\" racist drivel, &rdquo; \" shrug if off, &rdquo; or rationalize\nthe abuse \" philosophically &rdquo; (   Ibid. \n ) .\n\n\nIn other words, well-heeled Filipino migrants in Europe are\nimmobilized by attacks on their social identities, as if insults and\nhumiliation are the common lot of the Filipino. \n\n \n\nIn contrast, the contract workers, this time free migrants\ncompared with Sulu 's slave captives, do not necessarily see - - despite\nindividual misfortunes - - their own sojourn overseas as a tragedy for the\nnation.\n\n\nBut, unlike the Sulu case, international labor migration has a strong\nconnection to nationness, hence to the broader pattern of\ntransnationalization ( Basch  et al.  1994).\n\n\n\" Bro. Gino, &rdquo; the columnist who gives public advice in\nthe tabloid  News Today  in response to letters from OCWs, counsels\nmigrant workers in the post-Contemplacion era:     Kung\ngagawa tayo ng kapalpakan, hindi lamang pangalan natin ang mapapasama kundi\npati ang ating lahi    ( if we misbehave or do something\nwrong, it is not only our name that will be tarnished but our race) \n( Dormiendo 1995;3).\n\n\nApart from negative individual behavior (   kapalpakan\n  ) that may reflect badly on \" our race &rdquo; - -\nnationality and race are here conflated - - going overseas for employment is\nnot deemed by the contract worker to be a shameful act.\n\n\nThat the labor migrant moves about with the badge of his or her\nnationality is, however, irrefutable. \n\n \n\nThe scattering of Filipinos to various corners of the planet has\nundoubtedly exerted a profound impact on national identity and consciousness,\naffecting the non-migrant population in the Philippines as well as the\ndifferent classes of migrants overseas.\n\n\nThis essay explores recent changes in the Filipino world view while\nseeking to analyze the interconnections between the international migration\nof labor, Filipino nationhood, and what may be broadly termed as \"\nsocial class \" .\n\n\nThe thoughts and propositions laid out here have been influenced\nunavoidably by my own personal experiences of having lived in several\ncountries in the course of my studies and working life, although my stay\noverseas has been punctuated by annual visits to the Philippines lasting\nseveral weeks.\n\n\nIn writing this article, I have also drawn from formal interviews and\ncasual conversations with Filipino professionals and domestic workers in\nSingapore, where I lived for three years from 1993 to 1996.\n\n\nIn the sections that follow, I discuss what I observe to be the\ntransformations in the Filipino national imagination, the imprint of the\nexilic experience upon the national identities of Filipino workers overseas,\nand the contestatory challenge posed by ordinary OCWs to the definitions of\nthe nation preferred by Filipino elites and professionals. \n\n\n  Nationness and serialization  \n\n \n\nAs Anderson ( 1991:166) notes, Filipino nationalism \n\" has been, for a century now, on the trail of an aboriginal Eden,\n&rdquo;  in other words, stunted in its growth, unable to move beyond\nits embryonic stage following the symbolic birth of the nation in 1896.\n\n\nThis predicament of Filipino nationalism I attribute not merely to\nthe stultifying effects of colonial racism nor to the relative weakness of\nthe Philippine state, but more fundamentally to the aborted serialization and\npluralization of the national imagination of the Filipino.\n\n\nAs can be learnt from Anderson 's ( 1991) brilliant study, the birth\nof the modern nation did not occur in obscurity or isolation but rather the\nnational idea emerged when its creole pioneers were enabled in the late\neighteenth century to envisage, through print-capitalism and bodily journeys\nthrough administrative state structures and spaces, the territorial\njurisdiction in the Americas as constituting separate imagined communities.\n\n\nBound by the fatality of birth outside Europe, the innumerable but\nfinite members of each of the national communities formed a comradeship\ndistinguishable as the creole 'us' from the metropolitan 'them'.\n\n\nTerritorialized, relativized and serialized, the dynastic realism in\nEurope subsequently underwent a similar horizontal transformation.\n\n\nBut the relativization of the national political community\nnecessitated the existence of other entities from which the nation could be\nconceptualized as a community apart, from which the nation could be\ndifferentiated by its supposed uniqueness shared by everyone within but not\nby those without.\n\n\nThus the birth of the national idea occurred in a historical epoch in\nwhich a number of nations were forming coevally involving the simultaneous\nprocesses of inclusion and exclusion.\n\n\nNational consciousness emerged in a world of plurals: an\nindispensable prerequisite to the nation was its Others. \n\n \n\nMoreover, the nation was given discursive and pictorial\nrepresentation as a person framed in social intercourse with other nations-\n  qua   - persons on an international stage.\n\n\nThe embodiment of collective identity, the nation was seen as part of\na series of other nations, all of them imaginable as persons that by their\nvery existence constituted a so-called \" 'community of nations'\n\" .\n\n\nEmerging from the absolutist past, modern nationalism partook of the\nideology of individualism accentuated and legitimated by capitalist relations\nof production: nations were thought to be separate, unique, and equal, a\ndogma that translated into the political principle of national sovereignty.\n\n\nNonetheless, international parity was always unstable in a collection\nof individuals not connected, indeed separated, by nationality since, much\nlike individual persons, nations competed for ranking and dominance in a\nhierarchized world.\n\n\nIn any event, sufficient human qualities were projected onto the\nnation, despite its being a reified object of representation, a subject of\ndevotion, as well as an empirical political reality, such that the nation\ncould be concomitantly fetishized as though it were like you and me.\n\n\nThe consequence has been that, as Geoffrey Benjamin ( 1988:12)\nobserves,  \" international relations have been conducted as if\nthey were inter-  personal  relations, to the extent that as much\nattention must now be paid to a country 's supposed honour and shame as to\nits economic or political condition. &rdquo;", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "85d8fd2e-753a-4abf-aadd-beaf63131da8", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.182150+00:00"}
{"text": "Assessment of the Quality of Family Planning Services in\nSelected Service Delivery Points in the Philippines  \n\n\n Trinidad S. Osteria \n\n\n  ABSTRACT  \n\n \n\n In December 1995, a grant was provided by the UNFPA through\nthe DOH Family Planning Service to De La Salle University Social Development\nResearch Center ( SDRC) to undertake an evaluation of quality of care in\nfamily planning services in different service delivery points ( SDPs) in the\ncountry.\n\n\nThe objectives of the evaluation were as follows: ( 1) to describe the\navailability and quality of family planning activities in a sample of service\ndelivery points in the country; ( 2) to analyze the relationship between\nsubsystem functioning and the quality of services and posit modifications at\nthe programmatic and policy levels; and ( 3) to derive meaningful indicators\nfor the assessment of quality of care which relate to client satisfaction and\nprogram performance. \n\n \n\nThe approach to assess the quality in family planning service\ndelivery was to examine the strengths and weaknesses of the program focusing\non all major subsystems.\n\n\nUsing both observation and interviewing techniques, information was\ncollected on the key indicators of family planning subsystems, quality of\ncare, and SDO performance. \n\n \n\nThree basic questions were addressed by this study to help program\nmanagers and administrators develop policy recommendations for the program\nguidance and possible redirection; make necessary improvements in the range,\ntype, and quality of services provided; and establish baseline measures for\nplanning and evaluating future improvement: ( 1) Is each subsystem in place,\nthat is, ready to provide services?\n\n\nThese are: ( a) logistics/supplies; ( b) facilities/equipment; ( c)\nstaff; ( d) supervision/management; ( e) information, education, and\ncommunication ( IEC); and ( f) record keeping.\n\n\n( 2) If in place, is each subsystem functioning and ready to provide\nquality services?\n\n\n( 3) If each subsystem is functioning, are quality of services\nactually being provided and received?\n\n\nThe six components include: ( a) choice of contraceptive methods; (\nb) provider-client information exchange such as understanding client needs\nand information given to clients; ( c) provider competence; ( d)\nclient-provider interaction; ( e) mechanisms to encourage continuity; and (\nf) constellation of services. \n\n \n\nA set of forms was utilized.\n\n\nResults were tabulated and recommendations were generated.  \n\n\n  Introduction  \n\n \n\nThe 1993 Philippine National Demographic Survey ( NDS) revealed a\nwide gap between awareness and utilization of family planning methods.\n\n\nVirtually all currently married women knew of one or more family\nplanning methods ( 97 percent), while 61 percent had never used any.\n\n\nThe contraceptive prevalence rate was estimated as 40 percent of\ncurrently married women.\n\n\nOne common method of assessing the quality of contraceptive practice\nis to examine the first year continuation rates defined as the proportion of\nacceptors who are still using a method within 12 months after the start of\nuse.\n\n\nResults showed that overall, one in three users discontinued their\nchosen method in the first year of use.\n\n\nThe discontinuation rate was highest for the condom ( 59 percent),\nfollowed by withdrawal ( 41 percent), and the pill ( 40 percent).\n\n\nSide effects were cited as the major reason for termination of pill\nuse. \n\n\nHowever, it was recognized that other factors might have accounted\nfor the low rate of acceptance and continuation which could be related to the\nservice provision itself. \n\n \n\nBruce ( 1990) cited a neglected dimension in the use-continuation\nof family planning - - the quality of care rendered.\n\n\nShe posited that improvements in the quality of service will result\nin a larger, more committed clientele of satisfied contraceptive users.\n\n\nOver the long term, this expanded base of well served individuals\nwill translate into higher contraceptive prevalence, and ultimately,\nreduction in fertility.\n\n\nWithin publicly-supported programs, both clinic and community-based,\nit is likely that improvements in the quality of services will result in\ngreater initial acceptance and more sustained use.\n\n\nSpeculating more broadly and in simplistic terms about the societal\nimpacts of improved care in Asia, Bruce averred that it is the inadequacies\nin the array of services, and not contraceptive supply, that constrain\nexpanded use of contraceptives and further reductions in fertility.\n\n\nBeyond the global hypothesis that improvements in the quality of care\nare essential from human rights and demographic perspectives, she posited\nthat the largest potential reward for improving services exists where\nsocietal demand for child spacing and fertility regulation is low or\nunsteady, and as a corollary, where maternal and child health is poor.  \n\n\n  Quality of Care Defined  \n\n \n\nDonabedian ( 1980), the leading expert in modern quality\nassurance, formulated the classic definition of quality of care as \n\" that kind of care which is expected to maximize an inclusive measure\nof client welfare, after one has taken account of the balance expected of\ngains and losses that attend the process of care in all its parts. &rdquo;\n \n\n\nHigh quality of health care traditionally consists of a scientific or\ntechnical component and an interpersonal element that together enables the\nclient to attain the highest possible functional state and psychological\nresult.\n\n\nAs such, quality is determined by three factors: the user of the\nservice ( or client), the provider of the service ( or staff member), and the\norganization that provides the structure in which the staff operate. \n\n\nBruce pointed that the word \" quality \" and its\nimputed meaning have emerged in contradictory contexts; early family planning\nliterature discussed quality largely in relation to clinical operations to\nthe neglect of the interpersonal dimensions of care, suggesting that high\nquality meant technically sophisticated, expensive equipment.\n\n\nPrevious perceptions counted availability and/or accessibility of\ncontraceptives as synonymous to quality considered as vital determinants of\ncontraceptive use. \n\n\nBair ( 1987) defined quality in terms of potential demographic impact\nsuch as the proportion of women using long-term methods as a measure of\nfamily planning service quality. \n\n\nRoemer and Montoya Aguilar ( 1988) viewed it from the perspective of\nactions as the proper performance ( according to standards) of interventions\nthat are known to be safe, affordable, and able to produce the desired impact\non fertility. \n\n\nLeebov ( 1991) expanded the definition considerably by elaborating on\nthe slogan  \" doing the right things right &rdquo;  to\nmean obtaining the best possible outcomes ( fertility reduction, usage of\neffective methods, high continuation rates); satisfying all clients; and\nretaining competent staff.  \n\n\n  Quality of Care Framework  \n\n \n\nBruce presented the six salient elements of family planning\nprograms which constitute quality, namely: choice of methods, information\ngiven to clients, technical competence, interpersonal relations, follow-up\ncontinuity mechanisms, and appropriate constellation of services.\n\n\nAs such, the framework provides an ordered point of departure from\nwhich to develop a description of the service unit and define its quality.\n\n\nFigure 1 graphically presents the framework with the three broad\nheadings: program effort, quality of the service experience, and its impacts.\n \n\n \n\nChoice of methods pertains to the number of contraceptive methods\noffered on a reliable basis and their inherent variations.\n\n\nThe degree to which the needs of specific subgroups ( adolescents,\npre-menopausal, spacers, lactating) are addressed and the choices given to\nclients are considered significant.\n\n\nThe information provided during the interaction between the provider\nand the client includes the range of methods available, the\ncontraindications, advantages, details on the use of method, impacts on\nsexual practice, potential side effects, support and referral.\n\n\n\" Technical competence \" means the capability of the\nprovider to adhere to the standards that the specific technique requires, the\nobservance of protocols, and asepsis required for specific clinical methods.\n\n\n\" Interpersonal relations \" refer to the human\ndimension of the services such as quality of relationship between the\nproviders and clients as well as the degree of concern for the clients '\nwelfare.\n\n\nMechanisms to encourage continuity include referral, identification\nof supply source, and follow-up plans either through forward appointments or\nhome visits.\n\n\nThe constellation of services to the related programs - - MCH,\npostpartum care, or reproductive health - - situate family planning within a\ncomprehensive health framework. \n\n\n  The Philippine Family Planning Program   \n\n \n\nThe Philippine Family Planning Program ( PFPP) recognizes that\nthe aggregation of individuals ' and couples ' decisions and action has an\nimpact on overall fertility and population growth.\n\n\nIt regards this summation as a separate issue altogether distinct\nfrom the principal program focus of assisting couples for their own benefit\naccording to their aspirations.\n\n\nThe program intends to respond to the household demand for\ninformation and services relative to family planning on the assumption that\nthe satisfaction of individual couples would also mean the achievement of\noverall fertility reduction goals. \n\n \n\nThe Program defines the demand for family planning in two ways: (\na) in terms of the expressed desire of couples to space or limit their\nchildren for a variety of reasons; and ( b) the need to reduce the identified\nrisks to the health of mothers and children due to pregnancy and childbirth.\n\n\nThe Program regards demand on the basis of the couple 's fertility\naspirations and health needs.\n\n\nThus, it seeks to meet the demand for information and services by\nthose who want to practice family planning because they prefer wider child\nspacing or smaller families, and also by those who may need to practice\nbecause pregnancy and childbirth pose higher risks than they may be willing\nto bear. \n\n\n  Emphasis on Service Quality  \n\n \n\nThe Program relies on voluntary acceptance and compliance among\nservice users.\n\n\nIn order to maximize efficiency and effectiveness in supporting\ncouples ' choice, the Program emphasizes service quality as a means to expand\ninitial use by those who want and need these services, and continuing use by\nthose who initiate practice. \n\n \n\nService quality in family planning includes: ( a) assurance of\nsafety in methods and supplies utilized in the program; ( b) cost-efficient\ncoverage of service outlets in terms of physical reach and financial\nconsiderations; ( c) reliable links with associated maternal and child care\nservices necessary for women of reproductive age contemplating the prospects\nof pregnancy and childbirth; ( d) availability of a range of choice\nappropriate for various reasons and circumstances; ( e) correctness and\ncompleteness of information provided to potential acceptors; ( f) adequate\nsupport for continuation of practice by those acceptors who wish to do so; (\ng) regular, predictable, standardized, pleasant, and supportive clinic\nservices; and ( i) priority provision for rural couples with low education\nand income. \n\n \n\nThe revitalization of the family planning service delivery\nnetwork is largely built on improving service quality along the lines\ndescribed above.\n\n\nThe planning, organizing, budgeting, logistics, monitoring, and\nevaluation functions are undertaken for the purpose of assuring service\nquality.\n\n\nThe impact of improvements is measured in terms of utilization of\nservices by new acceptors and continuing users. \n\n\n  Decentralized Service Delivery at the Department of Health\n \n\n \n\nTo effectively become demand-driven and quality-conscious, the\nProgram is decentralized in terms of service delivery.\n\n\nCentral control is exercised through: ( a) clear policy articulation\nafter broad consultation; ( b) nationally-organized logistics support system;\n( c) standard reporting and evaluation; and ( d) national planning of\ninformation, education and communication ( IEC), training, clinical\nstandards; and other technically-determined functions.\n\n\nActual management of service outlets and implementation of service\nprograms through each participating organization are likewise decentralized.\n\n\nThus, the tasks of demand estimation, client identification and\nprioritization, establishment of outlets, upgrading or expansion of outlets,\nconduct of training, execution of IEC plans, clinic operation, area\ncoordination, and other services are undertaken at each locality via an\nappropriate regional, provincial, district, municipal or  barangay\n mechanism following the administrative structure of the Department\nof Health ( DOH). \n\n \n\nIn addition, as the overall decentralization of government\nproceeds and as local governments take on roles in the Program, the service\ndelivery maximizes linkages with local governments at the provincial,\nmunicipal, and  barangay  levels. \n\n\n  Service Content of the Programs  \n\n \n\nThe Program provides information and services.\n\n\nInformation consists of factual explanations of health and other\nbenefits of family planning, descriptions of various family planning methods\nincluded in the Program, and other materials that couples need to make fully\ninformed choices.\n\n\nIt also provides motivational materials to enable couples to explore\nreasons and options for responsible parenthood.\n\n\nFurthermore, the Program provides specific information to allow\ncouples to take steps to seek out and obtain services. \n\n \n\nThe Program makes available modern contraceptive methods, as well\nas information on other ways of managing fertility such as natural family\nplanning and breastfeeding.\n\n\nThe current methods available are low dose combination pills,\nintrauterine devices ( IUD), male or female voluntary surgical contraception,\ncondoms, and natural family planning ( NFP).\n\n\nThe Program provides an adequate range of choices on an area-wide\nbasis even as each outlet may opt to specialize in one or a few methods.\n\n\nIn the provision of services, the choice made by the client is the\nprincipal consideration.\n\n\nThere is no coercion in behalf of family planning or any specific\nmethod.\n\n\nProviders are required to advise and recommend, and care is always\ntaken to avoid misinformation or any action that could compromise the clients '\nright to a free and informed choice in managing their reproductive lives.\n\n\n \n\nAll supplies and techniques provided under the Program are\ncontrolled for safety and quality.\n\n\nNo special accommodation or compromise is made that deviates from\nnormal prudent practice for accepting and utilizing contraceptive supplies in\nthe Program.\n\n\nSince all program procedures are elective, patient safety is\npre-eminent.\n\n\nNew methods are thoroughly considered, studied, evaluated, and\ntested, prior to inclusion in the Program. \n\n \n\nMethod shifting on the part of program acceptors is fully\nsupported.\n\n\nProgram dropouts are given due attention by responding to their\nfamily planning needs or supporting them in their chosen pregnancy and\nchildbirth.\n\n\nWhile the Program emphasizes client satisfaction in one or some other\nchosen methods, the DOH continues to make its other health services equally\navailable to clients who have chosen pregnancy and childbirth.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "e0977c18-7c25-411b-8c83-2248dd8a7c6c", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.183495+00:00"}
{"text": "Health Social Science and Participatory Research:\nChallenging Traditional Thought and Practice  \n\n\n Jesusa M. Marco \n\n\n  ABSTRACT  \n\n \n\n Health social science is a new field of study that seeks to\nprovide an alternative perspective to established models and analyses that\nthe health/medical and social sciences have separately used in examining\nhealth social problems and issues today.\n\n\nNot wanting to reinvent the wheel, health social science advocates a\ntransdisciplinary approach in the conceptualization, collection and analysis\nof knowledge. \n\n \n\nParticipatory research, a methodology that emphasizes process, is\nseen to complement the interactive nature of health social science.\n\n\nThis paper presents the empowering characteristic participatory\nresearch can provide in understanding the socio-cultural dimension of\nreproductive tract infections ( RTIs) and in breaking through the silence\nwomen in particular have suffered in their experiences of RTIs.  \n\n \n\nThe impact of medicine and health care on the lives of people\ntoday has assumed immeasurable magnitude and value.\n\n\nAt the same time, people face mercurial changes in their communities\nand societies that have implications on their health and general well-being.\n\n\nThis increasing reality has challenged medical and social scientists\nto respond to changes and forces that threaten the individuals ' capacity to\nrealize their potential in various roles and activities.\n\n\nMedical and social scientists, given their ethnocentric disciplines,\nhave long ignored the fact that health is social and, therefore, necessitates\ninterdisciplinary cooperation.\n\n\nHowever, with the unabated and acute human health conditions that\nexist across societies, medical and social scientists have been compelled to\ncross their disciplinal boundaries, thus resulting in health social science.\n\n\nHealth social science, therefore, was conceived to enhance solutions\nfor the kind of health problems that emerged at this turn of the century.\n\n\nAs a new body of knowledge, health social science is in flux.\n\n\nInitiatives have begun with collaborations among different\ndisciplines and sectors in a specific activity - - say research - - to\ndevelop a common framework; redefine and build on concepts; sharpen existing\ntools and experiment with methods, and analyze the  \" problem\nfrom all systems level at the same time &rdquo;  ( Ratcliff, 1989).\n\n\nFrom this, a different and new integrative approach, described as\ntransdisciplinary, is produced.\n\n\nHowever, the accumulation of knowledge and experience necessary to\nsupport this new field of inquiry is still inadequate ( Rosenfield, 1992).\n\n\nWhat I hope to do in this paper is to illuminate ongoing efforts\ntoward this transdisciplinary approach, particularly in health social science\nresearch.\n\n\nTo do this, I will utilize the field activities I have conducted\nduring the past months to illustrate how a social science methodology such as\nparticipatory research ( PR) can inadvertently create conditions through\nwhich opportunities for interventions to improve women 's health can be\ninitiated. \n\n\n  Participatory Research in Health  \n\n \n\nParticipatory research ( PR), also referred to as participatory\naction research ( PAR), was initially developed in countries at Latin\nAmerica, Africa, and Asia.\n\n\nThe impetus for this approach was the concern with persistent\ninequalities in the distribution of power and resources, and the processes\nwhich help to keep in place dependency and domination in the relationships\nbetween privileged dominant and marginalized groups of people ( de Koning and\nMartin, 1996).\n\n\nThere was an increasing awareness that the feeling of helplessness\nabout one 's conditions must first be confronted to fight oppression and\nalleviate poverty. \n\n \n\nIn the development of health programmes, Budd Hall was one of the\nfirst writers to emphasize PR 's importance.\n\n\nThe emphasis on community participation in primary health care ( PHC)\nhas encouraged health professionals to look at the implications and relations\nbetween a community 's involvement in PHC and research.\n\n\nMany of the initial applications centered around the involvement of\ncommunities and health professionals in needs assessment, planning and\nevaluation of programmes ( Feuertein 1988, MacDonald 1986, Nichter 1984 in de\nKoning and Martin, 1996).\n\n\nSince then, other influences have contributed to the further\ndevelopment of participatory research.\n\n\nMoreover, primary health care has become more familiar in a diversity\nof disciplines and settings such as rural development and agriculture,\ncommunity development, health and education. \n\n \n\nParticipatory research has been interpreted in different ways.\n\n\nThese range from the collaboration between the researcher and\nresearch community designing the research, researcher designing the study and\nthe members of the community involved in data collection, to the community\nthat works closely with a non-governmental organization ( NGO).\n\n\nWhile what the activity is and who in the community will be involved\nin which activity are important in PR ( e.g., objective setting, design,\ncollection, analysis), it is just as important to determine the how, or the\nprocess of their involvement.\n\n\nPR emphasizes the process of knowledge production because:\n\n\n1. it helps the marginalized and deprived people to gain\nself-confidence and pride in being able to provide a useful contribution to\ncommunity life;\n\n\n2. it builds respect and empathy among professional groups for the\ninsights and knowledge people have and the problems they face; and\n\n\n3. it also facilitates the development of programmes that take into\naccount the specific situations and conditions which will influence the\noutcome/s of the programmes ( Chamber, 1983).\n\n\nListening to local people helps avoid mistakes. \n\n \n\nIn brief, participatory research advocates the integration of the\ntraditionally isolated practices of research, education and action through\nwhich dominant knowledge, structures and processes are challenged and, as a\nresult, empower underserved people to transform their existing social\nrealities. \n\n \n\nAs an alternative research practice, participatory research poses\nimportant implications to a person meeting the essential prerequisites of\nlife and living, one of which is health.\n\n\nGiven the above framework of PR, the human being is seen as an active\nagent in pursuit of her or his own health ( de Koning and Martin, 1996).\n\n\nThis means recognizing the person 's and community 's right to know\nabout such things as health status, the causes of ill-health, treatment and\nprevention, and resources available to improve health.\n\n\nHealth issues and needs have become far more complex than they were\nbefore.\n\n\nHence, people and communities need to acquire the capacity to\nunderstand issues related to their health.\n\n\nFeminist researchers, for example, enable groups of women to pose\nproblems and question standard definitions, explanations, decisions about\ntheir own experiences. \n\n \n\nThis research is an initial attempt to provide an avenue for a\nsector whose voices have long been ignored in understanding and managing a\nhealth problem that women have been socialized to be silent about. \n\n\n  Participatory Health Research through Women Talk \n\n\n \n\nFor the past eight months, I have been talking with urban poor\nwomen from  Sitio  Rizal, in Alabang, Muntinlupa, about\nreproductive tract infections ( RTI) specifically, and their reproductive\nhealth in general.\n\n\nTo paraphrase a standard definition, reproductive health is the\nability of women to  \" regulate their own fertility safely and\neffectively by conceiving when desired, by terminating unwanted pregnancies,\nand by carrying wanted pregnancies to term; remain free of disease,\ndisability, fear, pain, or death associated with reproduction and sexuality;\nbear and raise healthy children &rdquo;  ( Germain, 1987).\n\n\nWomen in the Philippines, particularly those who are poor, face a\nnumber of reproductive health problems such as RTI complications in\npregnancies, fetal wastage, sexual violence, and maternal nutrition. \n\n \n\nRTIs in the Philippines, as in many developing countries, are\nextremely common and their consequences on the health of women are serious\nand may even be fatal.\n\n\nThis situation is reinforced by a culture of silence surrounding RTIs\nin view of the misconception that women are responsible for RTIs, especially\nsexually transmitted diseases or STDs.\n\n\nAs observed by one researcher,  . \n\n \n\nCompounded by limited health services, women live with the\nsymptoms, pain, and morbidity that result from RTIs.\n\n\nIt is in this context that I have been talking with women, both\nmarried and single, and listening to their experiences, problems and\nconcerns.\n\n\nThrough a focus group discussion, which is not designed to be an\nexchange involving a selected group of women and myself, I engaged the women\nin what Dale Spender ( 1980) described as \" woman-to-woman talk\n\" systematized, with the women as the speaking subjects.\n\n\nIn \" \" women talk, &rdquo; \" the value of\ncommunication among the women themselves is most important.\n\n\nIt affords opportunities for women to speak more fully about their\nexperiences, especially if they perceive no barriers such as class and gender\ndifferences in speaking.\n\n\nAware that I was most different from them, and that there was a\npossibility that this might inhibit them, I saw to it that the approach to\nthe subject matter would allow them to feel comfortable enough to speak from\ntheir everyday experience. \n\n \n\nOur research, in medical language, is about reproductive\nmorbidity, specifically the socio-cultural dimensions in the occurrence,\ntransmission and treatment of reproductive tract infections primarily among\nwomen.\n\n\nEmploying a multi-method approach, consisting of a sample survey,\nfocus group discussion or FGD, clinical assessment, and key informant\ninterviews, the research demonstrated that the FGD was the most helpful\nmethod in understanding the social processes that a medical diagnosis does\nnot examine.\n\n\nOne of my initial difficulties, however, was that the term \"\n\" reproductive health &rdquo; \" cannot be easily and\naccurately translated into Filipino.\n\n\nBecause it would have been awkward for me to begin by immediately\nasking about private matters like fertility regulation, sexual activities,\nillness experienced related to their reproductive function, and other similar\nconcerns, I began with a question I first preferred not to ask for fear that\nit would elicit varied answers.\n\n\nBut I asked it anyway - -   Kumusta na ang inyong\nkalusugan?   \n\n\nWithout further specific questions, I received answers that were\nrelated to what the study is all about.\n\n\nIt was so natural for the women to talk about their common\ngynaecological concerns, foremost of which were unusually prolonged\nmenstruation or an irregular period ( for example, having a period twice a\nmonth and then not having one for three months) and other symptoms of\nmenopause for most of the married women.\n\n\nMany acknowledged experiencing not mere discomforts but other\nphysical conditions such as black-out, severe dizziness, back aches, and\nabdominal pains.\n\n\nHowever, it was also common for the women not to seek treatment for\nthese illnesses even if they perceive they may have gynaecological problems.\n\n\nThis was seen in their experience when having the abnormal vaginal\ndischarges and severe abdominal pain that accompany RTIs.\n\n\nFor them, RTIs are an inevitable part of being a woman and these are\nto be endured.\n\n\nFor nine ( 9) out of 10 married respondents, such conditions did not\nrequire help.\n\n\nThe one respondent who differed explained that she decided to have a\ncheck-up only once in the past because she was having two menstrual periods a\nmonth. \n\n \n\nPrior to the check-up she, just like many of the other women, had\nbeen regulating her fertility by drinking a herbal medicine, known as\n\" \"  makabuhay  , &rdquo; \" concocted\nby boiling the roots and mixing a bottle of Chinese whiskey or \"\n siyoktong  . &rdquo; She narrated:  \n\n \n\nHer story generated questions and varied experiences among the\nwomen regarding the use of herbal medicines sold with intention of remedying\nreproductive health problems.\n\n\nIn the course of the talk, when I felt the women were somehow waiting\nto hear another story that would confirm the consequences of using herbal\nmedicines, the same respondent reiterated what she was told at the\nPhilippines General Hospital:  .\n\n\nThe discussion then turned to \" pap smear \" , a\nprocedure they know is important but rarely consult their doctor about.\n\n\nSince pap smear, while valuable, serves only as a screening test, the\noccurrence of infection is hard to determine if also based on medical\ntreatment sought by women for gynaecological problems like infections since\nin most cases they do not seek help for these conditions.\n\n\nI asked why medical help is not sought and the simple response was\nthat it may bring into question the sexual behavior of both husband and wife.\n\n\nFurthermore, if infected, the women know they will be advised not to\nengage in sexual relations with their husbands, which may in turn lead to\ntension and even violence in the marital relationships.\n\n\nAs we talked about other related matters such as their use of family\nplanning methods and domestic issues like violence against women, I came to\nunderstand more about how the community mediates women 's attitudes and\nactions toward reproductive health problems, particularly in the case of\nRTIs.\n\n\nIt is in this context that I see how social scientists, through their\nskill of eliciting accounts that reveal the consciousness that has shaped the\nthoughts and perspectives of their respondents, can play a more distinctive\nrole in health and medicine. \n\n\n  Consciousness-Raising in Women Talk  \n\n \n\nThe 1980s witnessed an intellectual explosion of research efforts\nlinking the medical and social sciences ( Good, 1992).\n\n\nThis initiative was made possible after the significant Alma Ata\nconference of 1978, sponsored by the World Health Organization and UNICEF.\n\n\nThe Alma Ata meeting formulated the goal of \" Health for All\nby the Year 2000 \" , a goal to be achieved not by building\nhospitals, but by promoting community-based primary health care, community\nparticipation, and intersectoral actions for health ( WHO, 1978).\n\n\nCollaborative efforts between social science and medicine have been\nundertaken since then in several areas: cultural and behavioral aspects of\nspecific diseases ranging from malaria to leprosy and diarrhea; social\npathologies such as suicide and drug addiction; broad programmatic themes\nsuch as nutrition, family planning, child survival, and health services,\nincluding health care financing; and policy issues, from health-specific\nservice policies to intersectoral activities for health improvements. \n\n \n\nStronger support for interdisciplinary research was given\ninternational recognition following the publication in 1990 of the report of\nthe International Independent Commission on Health Research for Development (\nCommission on Health Research for Development, 1990).\n\n\nIts major recommendation is to promote \" \" Essential\nNational Health Research &rdquo;

{"text": "Anthropological and Cultural Values of Caves  \n\n\n Wilfredo P. Ronquillo \n\n\n  INTRODUCTION  \n\n \n\nMan, since his first appearance on the planet some 2.5 million\nyears ago, has made use of caves and rockshelters.\n\n\nThroughout the long period of man 's prehistory, caves and\nrockshelters have served him as shelters, burial grounds, and ceremonial\nplaces.\n\n\nNineteenth century archaeologists unearthed man-made stone tools from\ncaves in France, which served as direct evidences of prehistoric man 's\nactivities.\n\n\nThe discovery becomes significant when it is noted that the prevailing\nbelief then, even among the prominent men of science, was that the earth was\nonly 6000 years old.\n\n\nThat the earth had existed for millions of years slowly became the\naccepted paradigm as a result of succeeding overwhelming evidences from the\ngeological and archaeological sciences. \n\n \n\nArchaeological researchers in the Philippines in the last thirty\nyears substantiate the fact that numerous caves and rockshelters all over the\ncountry were used by the early Filipinos during the prehistoric period as\nhabitation, burial and ceremonial sites ( Ronquillo 1985).\n\n\nThese include the hundreds of caves and rockshelters recorded at\nPe&ntilde;ablanca, Cagayan Province ( Ronquillo & Santiago 1977), on Bohol\nIsland ( Santiago 1982), on Panay Island ( Coutts 1983), on Samar Island (\nHutterer 1969), on Palawan Island ( Fox 1970) and in southeastern Mindanao (\nSolheim  et al.  1979). \n\n \n\nIndividual caves and rockshelters which are significant for\nprehistoric research in Cagayan Province ( Thiel 1978; Cuevas 1980; Dalupan\n1981; Ronquillo 1981), at Angono, Rizal ( Peralta 1972), in Sorsogon ( Fox &\nEvangelista 1957a) and Cagraray Island, Albay Province ( Fox & Evangelista\n1957b), in Masbate ( Solheim 1968), in Misamis Oriental ( Bautista 1992), in\nsouthern Cotabato ( Kurjack  et al.  1971), at Sanga\nSanga, Tawi Tawi ( Spoehr 1973; Cabanilla & Cabanilla 1992; Ronquillo\n et al.  1993), and at Madam, Sarangani Province ( Dizon\n et al.  1992) have, likewise, all been indicative of the\nactive role played by indigenous prehistoric populations in the Philippine\narchipelago and their cultural affinity with the Southeast Asian and the\nPacific areas. \n\n\n ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCES IN CAVES IN THE COUNTRY \n\n \n\nCaves, rockshelters and overhangs used by our prehistoric\nancestors fall into various archaeological categories, namely, 1) habitation\nsites - - areas which they used as their homes as indicated by their\nactivities as shown by the artifacts they left behind, such as potteries and\nstone tools and other, related materials, such as food remains; 2) burial\nsites - - areas used as places for burying their dead, which included placing\nthe dead in jars or in intricately-designed wooden coffins; and 3) ceremonial\nsites - - areas where rituals took place as may be indicated by paintings\nand/or incisions on the walls of the caves or rockshelters as well as other\ncultural material evidences left behind indicating use as offerings. \n\n \n\nIn numerous cases, as shown by systematic archaeological\nexcavations, caves indicate multiple uses delineated by the above activities.\n\n\n \n\nFive noteworthy archaeological sites in caves and rockshelters\nlocated in different parts of the country are summarized and presented below:\n\n\n\n  1. Quezon, Palawan Island  \n\n \n\nFrom 1962 through 1966 archaeologists from the National Museum\nconducted exploration and excavation activities in the island of Palawan,\nconcentrating their work at Lipuun Point, a limestone promontory in the\nmunicipality of Quezon.\n\n\nHundreds of caves and rockshelters are known to exist in the area,\nmany of which are potential archaeological sites.\n\n\nArchaeological work in the Tabon Caves resulted in the establishment\nof the first reliable evidence for a very early human presence in the\nPhilippines.\n\n\nSix successive periods of human occupation were identified at Tabon\nCave, covering a period of over 30,000 years.\n\n\nThe radiocarbon dates generated from this cave range from as early as\n30,000 years ago to as late as 9,500 years ago. \n\n \n\nThe results of the archaeological work at the Tabon Caves have\nbeen published ( Fox 1970).\n\n\nThey include data on the recovery of human bone fragments, which,\nalthough recovered from a disturbed area of the cave, have been dated from\n22,000 to 24,000 years ago - - so far the earliest skeletal evidence for \n Homo sapiens   in the Philippines. \n\n\n  2. Pe&ntilde;ablanca, Cagayan Province  \n\n \n\nIn 1976 and 1977 over a hundred caves and rockshelters were\nrecorded from the limestone formation of Pe&ntilde;ablanca, Cagayan Province.\n\n\nMore than fifty are archaeological sites and nine have been excavated\nby the National Museum ( Ronquillo & Santiago 1977).\n\n\nThe different radiocarbon dates available from the excavated caves at\nthe Pe&ntilde;ablanca Limestone Formation range in date from as early as\n14,000 B.C. in Callao Cave to as late as A.D. 50 in Arku Cave ( Bronson &\nWhite 1992:486-487). \n\n \n\nThe main objective of the Pe&ntilde;ablanca Archaeological\nProject was to determine the variability in the stone tool technology at the\narea and delineate them in time and space.\n\n\nInterest was in the method of manufacture as well as in the plausible\nfunctions of the stone tools recovered from the different cave sites\nexcavated ( Ronquillo 1981). \n\n \n\nPreliminary results of the analysis of the animal remains from a\nnumber of excavated cave and rockshelter sites at Pe&ntilde;ablanca indicate\nthe exploitation of a broad resource base by hunters and gatherers, who may\nhave had contacts with sedentary agriculturalists ( Henson 1978). \n\n\n  3. Anda Peninsula, Bohol Province  \n\n \n\nIn 1981 archaeologists from the National Museum undertook survey\nand exploration activities in the limestone formation of the Anda Peninsula\nand the Mabini area in southeastern Bohol.\n\n\nThe aim of the project was to determine potential archaeological\nareas and point out key priority sites containing evidences relevant to the\ninterpretation of the prehistory of the island ( Santiago 1982).\n\n\nThe archaeological survey and exploration area was chosen based on\nreports of local residents on the existence of burial sites situated along\nthe coastal areas of Cogtong Bay. \n\n \n\nOver one hundred and fifty ( 150) caves, rockshelters, and\noverhangs were recorded, twenty seven ( 27) of which have been identified as\narchaeological sites.\n\n\nNine caves have been excavated.\n\n\nThe sites encountered indicated habitation, burial and places where\nreligious activities had been performed.\n\n\nArchaeological research in Bohol has revealed the widespread practice\nof wooden coffin burials in caves and rockshelters, whose dates may range\nfrom the Developed Metal Age to the Protohistoric Period.\n\n\nThese wooden coffins were carved from logs and had a predominantly\nreptile design on the lid.\n\n\nThese were noted to have been used both for primary and for secondary\nburials.\n\n\nJudging by the archaeological explorations undertaken in 1981, the\narchaeological potential of caves and rockshelters in Bohol Island is great.\n\n\n\n  4. Madam, Sarangani Province  \n\n \n\nOne of the most recent significant finds by archaeologists from\nthe National Museum is the anthropomorphic burial jars discovered at Ayub\nCave, Madam, Sarangani Province.\n\n\nThese low-fired earthenware jars contained secondary burials - - with\nincomplete human skeletal remains.\n\n\nThe site is situated in the coastal area of Pinol, Maitum, Sarangani\nProvince and is  approximately 1000 meters due south of the Mindanao\nSea shoreline ( from Pinol) with an elevation of 6 meters above mean sea\nlevel  ( Dizon 1991:3). \n\n \n\nAyub Cave was found to have been severely disturbed by treasure\nhunters.\n\n\nDigging was done in the front part as well as in the central and rear\nportions of the cave.\n\n\nThe broken pieces of anthropomorphic jars were haphazardly placed on\nthe surface alongside the walls of the cave by the illegal diggers. \n\n \n\nFragments from at least twenty-five ( 25) restorable secondary\nburial jars were recovered.\n\n\nThe covers of the jars were in the shape of human heads.\n\n\nThe bodies of the jars show complete sets of shoulders, arms, breasts\nand hands.\n\n\nIt was noted that  some ears, mouth and chin of the heads are\nappliqued while others are directly molded with the head  ( Dizon\n1991:4).\n\n\nA number of these earthenware heads were noticeably painted with red\n( hematite) and black ( possibly manganese). \n\n \n\nDirectly associated with the burial jars were intricately\ndecorated earthenware jarlets, glass beads and bracelets, earthenware beads\nand shell implements and ornaments ( Dizon  et al. \n1992:4).\n\n\nOn the basis of the associated materials the site is dated to the\nMetal Age,  ca.  500 B.C. \n\n\n  5. Sanga Sanga, Tawi Tawi Province  \n\n \n\nThe Balobok Rockshelter, located at Sanga Sanga Island in Tawi\nTawi Province, was first reported to the National Museum in 1966.\n\n\nPartial excavations of the site were undertaken in 1969 ( Spoehr\n1973) and in 1970 ( Cabanilla & Cabanilla 1992).\n\n\nA re-excavation of the site in 1992 was deemed necessary because\n \" the earlier limited excavations in 1969 and in 1970 have\ngenerated limited, but intriguing, archaeological data the completeness of\nwhich may be essential to Philippine, Southeast Asian and Pacific prehistory\n&rdquo;  ( Ronquillo  et al.  1993:1). \n\n \n\nThe recovery from the site of polished shell adzes made from the\ngiant clam   Tridacna gigas   , which date to as\nfar back as 7,000 B.P. ( before the present), is deemed significant to the\nidentical, but later (  ca.  2,000 B.P.) polished shell\nadzes found in the Miyako and Yaeyama Islands in southern Ryuku, as well as\non numerous Pacific islands ( Asato 1990). \n\n \n\nThe Balobok Rockshelter is a habitation site with three distinct\ncultural phases of occupation.\n\n\nThe four radiocarbon dates generated in 1992 delineate the sequential\nchronology, which range from 6810 B.C. to 3190 B.C.\n\n\nThe technology of manufacture of the polished adzes recovered at\nBalobok is inferred from the earlier flaking method observed in the recovered\nflaked shell and stone tools at the site.\n\n\nShell blanks were initially flaked, using the percussion technique,\nand were later polished to achieve the desired shape and sharpness of the\nprehistoric adze. \n\n\n ISSUES, PROBLEMS AND CONCERNS \n\n \n\nThe Philippine Constitution distinctly provides for the\npreservation and development of Filipino culture for national identity.\n\n\nThe cave archaeological resources of the country are protected by\nlaws of the land, particularly by Republic Act No. 4846, otherwise known as\n\" \" The Cultural Properties Preservation and Protection Act,\n&rdquo; \" which declares that it is the policy of the state to\npreserve and protect the cultural properties of the nation.\n\n\nIts amendment, Presidential Decree No. 374, strengthens the original\nAct.\n\n\nPresidential Decree No. 260, and its amendment, P.D. 1492, declares\nas national shrines, and/or landmarks important places in the country, which\ninclude, among others, the petroglyphs of the Rockshelter in Angono, Rizal,\nthe petroglyphs of Alab, Bontoc, the Mummy Caves of Kabayan, Benguet and of\nSagada and Alab, Bontoc, and the petroglyphs in the Cave at the Tau't Batu\narea in Barangay Ransang, Quezon, Palawan. \n\n \n\nCaves, rockshelters and overhangs declared by the National Museum\nas archaeological sites - -  \" any place which may be\nunderground, or on the surface, underwater or at sea level which contains\nfossils, artifacts and other cultural, geological, botanical, zoological\nmaterials which depict and document evidence of paleontological and\nprehistoric events &rdquo;  - - are easily the target of rampant\ndestruction through illegal looting, guano collecting, treasure hunting for\nthe 'famed' Yamashita gold, illegal stalactite gathering, and exploitation\nand decay due to ignorance, neglect or indifference. \n\n \n\nTreasure hunting activities for buried Japanese plundered \"\ntreasures\", which has recently become a craze in the country, is legalized\nthrough Presidential Decree No. 1726-a and are enforced by a separate\ngovernment office, notably the Presidential Security Group in\nMalaca&ntilde;ang.\n\n\nThis legalization of treasure hunting activities has done\nunparalleled damage to the country 's archaeological cave sites.\n\n\nThe indiscriminate diggings by the treasure hunters, without concern\nfor the country 's archaeological heritage found in cave sites, invariably\ndestroy an important component of the country 's non-renewable resources.\n\n\n \n\nUncontrolled and illegal guano collecting inside caves and\nrockshelters also result in the destruction of important archaeological\nresources.\n\n\nThe National Museum has an existing Memorandum of Agreement with the\nBureau of Mines and Geo-Sciences, which orders application for guano\nextractions to be first referred to the National Museum.\n\n\nThis, however, has only been implemented, mostly in the Visayas, in\nthe 1980s.\n\n\nSince the enactment of the Local Government Code, permits for guano\ncollecting in caves are issued by the local governments. \n\n\n POLICY AND MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS \n\n \n\nAs products of and witness to past cultural achievements, the\narchaeological heritage of the Philippines is significant, both to the\ncountry and as part and parcel of the world heritage.\n\n\nAdequate protection of these resources through improved enforcement\nof existing laws and regulations, proper linkages and networking among\nagencies involved in protecting the country 's cultural heritage as well as\nthe undertaking of feasible programs of information and awareness, both\ngeared for the public and the law enforcers, are necessary and essential\ncourses of action. \n\n \n\nThe archaeological heritage, unlike other cultural resources, is\nparticularly fragile.\n\n\nSite destruction as a result of soil erosion, development projects,\nillegal pot-hunting activities, and uncontrolled guano collecting, all\ncontribute to the irreversible destruction and loss of the country 's\narchaeological resources in caves and rockshelters. \n\n \n\nThe archaeological treasures of Philippine caves have important\neducational, recreational, and tourism applications.\n\n\nProperly protected and managed, these archaeological sites may be\ndeveloped and expanded into recreational and educational areas for the\nappreciation of students and tourists, local as well as foreign.\n\n\nThe potentials of archaeological cave sites as recreational areas and\ntourist attractions are only now starting to be realized by the tourism\nindustry and, when properly managed and protected, may well be a good\nalternative source of needed currency for the country. \n\n \n\nA number of the caves noted above have been declared \"\n\" National Treasures &rdquo; \" because they possess \n\" outstanding historical, cultural, artistic and/or scientific value\nwhich is significant and important to this country and nation. &rdquo;\n\n\n\nAs such, they are protected by law from being destroyed.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the enforcement of the laws on the protection and\npreservation of non-renewable archaeological resources still leaves much to\nbe desired. \n\n \n\nAs matters of policy and management the following are considered\nessential for the proper protection of the important, non-renewable, and\nfragile archaeological resources found in caves and rockshelters all over the\ncountry: \n\n \n\n1. R.A. 4846 and its amendments P.D. 374, also known as \"\n\" The Cultural Properties Preservation and Protection Act, &rdquo;\n\" need to be disseminated nationwide for their proper\nimplementation.\n\n\nThe adequate and effective protection of the country 's non-renewable\narchaeological resources need to be appreciated and enforced specifically by\nthe officials of the Local Governments, the members of registered\nNon-Government Organizations ( NGOs), the public school teachers and\nstudents, the law enforcers of the land, and the numerous members of\ncivic-oriented organizations, such as the Rotary, Kiwanis, Lions and the\nlocal cultural and heritage foundations.\n\n\nThe Department of Education, Culture and Sports, the Department of\nTourism and the newly-created National Commission on Culture and the Arts\ncould all contribute positively in this essential, important, and timely\nArchaeological Heritage Dissemination Project. \n\n \n\n2. An Archaeological Tourism Program, designed to enhance the\ntourism potential of archaeological cave sites, may well be opportune through\na networking between the National Museum and the Department of Tourism.\n\n\nAs a combination of the past and the natural environment,  Cave\nArchaeological Sites  are ideal for tourism and recreational purposes.\n\n\nThe focus of this program may include the identification,\nformulation, marketing and retailing of the past through relevant\ninterpretation.\n\n\nThat these sites be made accessible to and appreciated by the general\npublic, without compromising their intrinsic cultural value, should be\nconsidered one of the program 's primary goals. \n\n \n\n3. Applications for guano collecting inside caves and\nrockshelters should require the appropriate evaluation of and clearance from\nthe National Museum prior to the issuance of permits by Local Governments for\nthe extraction of the fertilizers for commercial purposes.\n\n\nIn this way we may yet prevent the destruction of non-renewable\narchaeological resources in caves and rockshelters. \n\n \n\n4. The protection and preservation of archaeological resources\ninside caves and rockshelters, which is incorporated in the Implementing\nRules and Regulations for the National Integrated Protected Area System (\nNIPAS), recently enacted as R.A. No. 7586, and now being implemented by the\nDENR, requires close coordination with National Museum archaeologists.\n\n\nAs mandated in R.A. 4846 and P.D. 374 this is now complied within\nthe conduct of any archaeological activities envisioned. \n\n \n\n5. P.D. 1726-A now needs to be critically assessed, evaluated\nand, if so warranted, repealed.\n\n\nThis Martial Law Decree is contradictory to R.A. 4846 and P.D. 374\nand, therefore, is detrimental to the vital protection and preservation of\nthe country 's cultural resources.\n\n\nP.D. 1726-A provides blanket authority to search and dig\nindiscriminately in search for the Yamashita treasure and has already done\nunparalleled damage to cave archaeological resources all over the country.\n\n\n \n\nThe historical period in the Philippines started only in the\n16th century - - or just over 400 years ago.\n\n\nThis is a minuscule period of time considering the 500,000 years\nprehistory of the country.\n\n\nThe selective and incomplete historical records can be enhanced\nthrough adequate archaeological research.\n\n\nThe only way to explicate the prehistoric life ways of the\nprehistoric Filipinos and to bring to light the lives of 25,000 past\ngenerations of our Filipino ancestors is through appropriate archaeological\nresearch and well-reasoned interpretation of the country 's archaeological\nresources.\n\n\nLarge numbers of these are found in caves and rockshelters. \n\n \n\nThe unabated destruction of important and non-renewable\narchaeological sites in caves, rockshelters and overhangs is unfortunate\nbecause these archaeological sites have recreational, educational and tourism\npotentials if properly tapped.\n\n\nThe archaeological resources of the country have an intrinsic\nqualitative value which lies in their ability to act as tangible symbols of\npast Philippine cultural communities and in their potential as a source of\nknowledge.\n\n\nThe government, the private sector, civic-oriented groups, law\nenforcers and individuals need to shoulder a collective responsibility to\nprotect and preserve the cave archaeological resources of the country to\nensure their safety from pillage and wanton looting. \n\n \n\nA nation 's cave archaeological resources are non-renewable\nwealth of the country and, as such, need to be adequately protected and\nmanaged.\n\n\nThese resources are part of a country 's history and national\nidentity.\n\n\nIt is but fitting to protect and preserve them for the appreciation\nand enrichment of the succeeding generations of Filipinos.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "1babf984-2548-4bd9-9e4e-042f799e58f0", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.186126+00:00"}
{"text": "Overseas Migration of Women: Realities and Consequences\n \n\n\n Sylvia H. Guerrero \n\n \n\nLarge numbers of women continue to leave the country each year to\nwork mainly as domestic helpers, nurses, and entertainers in the Middle East,\nHongkong, Singapore, Japan, Italy, Spain, the U.S.A., and Canada.\n\n\nConstituting almost half of all overseas contract workers ( OCWs),\nthey contribute significantly to the government 's foreign exchange earnings,\nhelping ease the balance of payments deficit.\n\n\nThey also alleviate the unemployment pressures in the country.\n\n\nFormer President Corazon Aquino called them the \" \" new\nheroes &rdquo; \" of the Philippines. \n\n \n\nAlthough the economic benefits are readily acknowledged both at\nthe micro and macro-levels, overseas contract migration has had many\nattendant problems.\n\n\nSystematic research and analyses are uncovering disruptive\nsocio-psychological consequences on both the migrants themselves and the\nfamilies and communities they leave behind. \n\n \n\nThis paper will review studies on the realities and perspectives\non overseas contract migration.\n\n\nIt will analyze the impact of women 's migration on families and\ncommunities; and in the light of this dialogue 's theme, reflect on the\nchallenges these findings posed towards improving the status and quality of\nlife of Filipino women. \n\n\n  The Facts about Overseas Migration  \n\n \n\nThe number of women overseas contract workers has increased\ntremendously in recent years.\n\n\nIn 1987, the POEA ( Philippine Overseas Employment Administration)\nrecorded a total of 382,299 land-based OCWs, 47.2% of whom were women - - or\napproximately 180,441.\n\n\nFrom 1984 to 1989, an average of 344,513 workers had been deployed,\naccounting for a third of workers in the world labor market.\n\n\nAlthough a slight decrease occurred during the Gulf crisis, by 1991,\nfigures had almost doubled - - with 752,700 OCWs reported by the National\nStatistics Office.\n\n\nThe increases have been particularly significant among women OCWs.\n\n\n \n\nWomen OCWs are mainly based in Asia ( 72%); the rest are in\nEurope ( 11%), U.S.A. ( 8%) and other continents ( 9%).\n\n\nIn Asia, Saudi Arabia received the most number of Filipino overseas\nworkers ( predominantly male) and Singapore ( 6 out of 8 are women OCWs).\n\n\nThey are predominantly engaging in service ( 60%) and in\nprofessional, technical and related professions ( 35%). \n\n \n\nIn terms of actual numbers, there were 95,352 domestic helpers\nrecorded in 1991 ( up from 81,000 in 1987) and 45,899 entertainers in Japan.\n\n\n \n\nThese official figures do not accurately reveal the number of\nworkers since these do not include those who leave the country as \"\ntourists &rdquo; but end up working illegally in the countries of\ndestination.\n\n\nA Scalabrini Center Study ( 1987) estimated that there were roughly\n80,000-100,000 illegally deployed workers to 400,000-460,000 registered land\nand sea-based OCWs and permanent migrants in the early to mid-1980s. \n\n \n\nApproximately half a million women leave the country every year,\naccording to some estimates.\n\n\nAn overwhelming number seek work as domestic helpers.\n\n\nBetween 1990-1991, land-based overseas employment grew at 36% (\ncompared to 13% of sea-based contract migration).\n\n\nThe women who leave were generally young: 66% were in the age group\n20-34 years old; median age is 29.6 years.\n\n\nIn comparison, men are slightly older, with a median age of 35.9\nyears. \n\n \n\nGeertje Lychlama, in her analysis of the trade in domestic\nhelpers ( cited in the Philippine Country Report 1992), contextualized this\nphenomenon within the global framework of international migration.\n\n\n  \" Throughout history, people ( men and women)\nforced by all kinds of structural changes and due to all kinds of personal\nreasons, have been migrating.\n\n\nTraditionally, women have always borne the burdens of household\nwork, and historically, women have been migrating on their own to do\nhousehold work on a contract basis in a foreign country.\n\n\nWhat is particularly striking, however, about this type of labor\nmigration in South and Southeast Asia is that  it has grown into a big\nmoney-making business in which the state is also involved. &rdquo; \n  \n\n\n  Perspectives on Migration  \n\n \n\nMigration is seen as a mechanism for effecting a greater balance\nof population and resources.\n\n\nIndividuals react to forces in the environment which push them from\none area towards another.\n\n\nMany of these forces are economic in nature - - such as differences\nin employment and wage levels.\n\n\nMigrants are seen as basically rational beings calculating both the\ncosts and benefits of a potential move.\n\n\nThrough migration, rural-urban and inter-regional imbalances are\nultimately corrected ( del Rosario 1994; A&ntilde;onuevo 1989).\n\n\nWhy do people migrate?\n\n\nWhat makes women leave for overseas work despite the reported abuses\nand maltreatment of OCWs?\n\n\nWhy do they return after experiencing the loneliness of separation\nfrom home and family?\n\n\nWhat is the balance of costs and benefits? \n\n \n\nMany studies have been done to answer these and other questions.\n\n\nTwo perspectives dominate the literature on migration: the\nequilibrium model of labor mobility and the historical-structural theories.\n\n\nIn mobility studies, the focus was on individual migrants, reasons\nfor migration and the migration experience itself. \n\n \n\nHistorical-structural perspectives, on the other hand, focus on\nmacro-structural processes that propel population movements, including\n \" pressures and counterpressures, both internal and external to\nthe economy &rdquo;  .\n\n\nAccording to one proponent ( cited by del Rosario 1994): \n\" The decision of the migrant to leave his region of origin is\ncompletely predetermined by the allocation strategy determining the\nallocation of factors ( i.e., the overall strategy of development for a\ncountry or region). &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nUnlike equilibrium theorists, historical-structuralists contend\nthat migration benefits the receiving countries in the long-term ( with some\nshort-term positive effects for sending countries) and overall uneven\ndevelopment results between sending and receiving countries. \n\n \n\nEmerging feminist perspectives have criticized both positions for\ntheir neglect and/or disregard of gender-related and non-economic factors in\nmigration.\n\n\nApart from gender as a major dimension, the role of the household and\nthe family in the decision-making process is not given adequate attention.\n\n\nMoreover, they emphasized that the role of the state in promoting\ninternational migration has not been factored into the analysis. \n\n \n\nGibson and Graham ( cited by del Rosario 1994:48) explained the\nsituation as follows:  . \n\n \n\nIn her analysis of the mail-order bride migration of Filipino\nwomen in the 1980s, del Rosario ( 1994) elaborates and develops this\nalternative perspective to explain the complexities of migration.\n\n\nUsing the multiple-identities analytical framework, she takes the\nmigrant women  \" to the center stage as purposive social actors\nwho are in constant interaction with the wider social, cultural, economic,\npolitical pressures, thereby maintaining that individual issues cannot be\nseparate from macro pressures &rdquo;  ( 317).\n\n\nIndividual groups and institutions, according to this perspective,\n \" act according to multiplicative, sometimes conflicting\neffects of gender, race, ethnicity, religion, and other important factors\n&rdquo;  . \n\n\n  Consequences of Women 's Migration  \n\n \n\nAvailable literature on the subject ranges from journalistic\naccounts and investigative reports, case studies, and government reports, to\nsystematic surveys and research reviews and analyses.\n\n\nThe impacts of migration, whether internal or overseas, are viewed at\nthe level of individual migrants, households and families, the nation and\nregion. \n\n\n  On Individual Migrants  \n\n \n\nAt the individual level of analysis, studies revealed that OCWs\nnot only express relative satisfaction with their decision to work abroad but\nalso continued to renew their contracts despite the hardships experienced.\n\n\nThe economic necessity was often cited as the main reason for seeking\noverseas work; i.e., ( 1990-1991) of 3,099 women-applicants for overseas\ndomestic work underscored this motivation: 67.6% claimed that higher pay\nabroad was the principal attraction, as one of five women further deplored\nthe few job opportunities available in the country. \n\n \n\nIn most cases, the promise of future gratification mitigates the\ndiscomforts and dissatisfactions of the present.\n\n\nWithin the framework of migration, the psychological future is\nclearly built into the structure of the psychological present. \n\n \n\nIn their study of male OCWs, Arcinas   et al.\n  ( 1989:72) observed that  \" when it comes to\nitems that are in the nature of summing up questions, our migrant worker\nrespondents seem almost blindly determined to convince others, and maybe more\nimportantly themselves, that all the sacrifices that went into their Saudi\nexperience had not been in vain, that the results have, on the whole, been\nsalutary. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nAnalyses based on household and community surveys ( Jimenez 1988)\nhave likewise highlighted the positive impacts of overseas work in terms of\nincreased incomes for the household/family resulting in higher levels of\nliving ( indicated by land ownership, housing, possession of household\nconveniences, etc.), enhanced status of the worker within his/her family and\ncommunity, and personal growth and development for the spouse left behind.\n\n\n \n\nFor the woman migrant, studies disclosed the empowering effects\nof gainful work.\n\n\nA higher income earned in the urban vs. rural setting, overseas vs.\nin-country employment, confers upon the worker higher status, respect and\ndecision-making prerogatives. \n\n \n\nPertierra and colleagues ( 1992:90) noted the deferential\ntreatment given to the migrant by family members.\n\n\nThis seems logical, for after all, they bring in the money, so that\neven otherwise conservative parents ( of single migrants) acquiesce to their\ndaughters ' \" sexual liaisons. &rdquo; \n\n \n\nReturnees coming home for a visit, after a stint in Europe or the\nU.S., look and dress better, have fairer skin ( not being  \"\nexposed to the effects of sun and rain as they would have, had they remained\non the farm, helps them preserve their looks better than their village\ncounterparts &rdquo;  ) and behave in more sophisticated and\nurbanized ways.\n\n\nThis, they point out, is true even with domestic helpers in Metro\nManila who  \" are considered fortunate by their counterparts in\nthe province &rdquo;  .\n\n\nIn fact, these returnees now vie for the coveted town fiesta queen\nand candidates from other barrios often  \" readily concede\ndefeat &rdquo;  ( Pertierra, 1992). \n\n \n\nAnother indicator of this improved status is their popularity as\n  ninangs   or sponsors in baptisms, weddings, and\nother town activities ( Pertierra   et al.   ,\n1992).\n\n\nOther analysts have attributed to the Hawaiian dollar pensions of\nreturning migrants  \" the resurgence of rituals of status\n&rdquo;  in many Ilocos towns ( Griffiths, 1978; Pertierra 1992).\n\n\n \n\nThe broadening of horizons has also been demonstrated in studies\non the impact of women 's work.\n\n\nMy own studies of EPZ workers, many of whom were internal migrants,\nrevealed the workers ' propensity to postpone marriage, and aim for higher\neducation thereby increasing chances of going abroad to improve their lives (\nGuerrero   et al.   ., 1989). \n\n \n\nPertierra ( 1992:96) observed the following effects on Ilocano\nreturnees:   \" They are all praises for the order they\nobserve in cities abroad.\n\n\nTraffic flows freely, streets are clean, and parks are safe places\nto meet friends during weekends.\n\n\nThey admire the efficiency of the police &rdquo;   ,\nespecially because they perceive that crimes are dealt with irrespective of\none 's social position.\n\n\nThese workers have learned that all citizens and legal residents,\nincluding domestics, have rights and are entitled to medical assistance. \n\n \n\nHaving lived in another country has widened the perspective of\noverseas workers.\n\n\nMrs. Roca, having been exposed to western approaches, expressed her\nfrustration over the intricate process she had to go through to face her\nhusband about the separation...\n\n\n  Abroad there is no need for so much talk.\n\n\nIf you want a divorce, then you divorce   . \n\n \n\nAccording to the migrants ' own calculation, the benefits\noutweigh the costs.\n\n\nThe costs of separation from the family and friends, the low status\nof domestic service are more than compensated by a higher pay and the\ngratification stemming from their fulfillment of family duties and\nresponsibilities.\n\n\nOn the whole, a favorable balance of attainments and expectations are\nattained and the migrants feel satisfied.\n\n\nThe anticipation of a better future for one 's children ( i.e., money\nwill be saved for children 's college education) tends to mitigate the\ndissatisfaction with the present. \n\n \n\nThe Scalabrini Study ( 1987) on \" \" Solo Parents\nand Seasonal Orphans &rdquo; \" supports this perspective.\n\n\nStudent/youth respondents whose parents were working either overseas\nor in other parts of the country generally agreed with attitudinal items such\nas:\n\n\n- A lowly job overseas with good pay is better than working as a\nprofessional with low salary in the Philippines\n\n\n- Working abroad enriches one 's personality\n\n\n- A student should choose a course that would qualify him/her for\noverseas work\n\n\n- One can earn more and save by working abroad \n\n \n\nAlthough families have been able to cope with these disruptions\nin the short-term, the full impact and long-term consequences of solo\nparenting or surrogate parenting will only be felt probably by the next\ngeneration of Filipinos.\n\n\nPsychologists have already raised alarm signals over this phenomenon.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "4815d1b7-e7cd-44ee-bfe5-8004a53edca2", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.187618+00:00"}
{"text": "Filipino Women: Transcending Their Marginalization in\nHistory  \n\n\n Teresita Arce-Herrera \n\n \n\nHistory possesses the power of giving importance to persons by\nchronicling their accomplishments.\n\n\nIt also possesses the power of burying them in oblivion or\nnon-existence.\n\n\nBecause Philippine history has been recorded by Filipino males based\non archival documents left by Spanish friars ( also males), two ways\nrelegated women to the corners of non-recognition - - the perspective of\nforeigners and the male viewpoint. \n\n \n\nHowever, power is not only in patriarchy or in the history that\nmen write.\n\n\nPower is also possessed by women in history or \" herstory\n&rdquo; although they have been excluded from the process of writing it.\n\n\nWhat is needed is to resurface women 's accomplishments in history so\nthat their people can be made aware of these, and therefore return to them\ntheir lost identity as persons equal to men. \n\n \n\nThis paper aims to give its readers a knowledge of women in\ndevelopment, from \" our perspective of history &rdquo; as translated\nfrom Salazar 's   pantayong pananaw sa kasaysayan   (\nmimeographed, n.d.).\n\n\nThis is the mentality in Filipino culture and society which is\ndifferent from that of foreigners.\n\n\nHowever, in this paper, the emphasis is not on the writings of\nFilipino and foreign male historians on Filipino women, but that of female\nFilipino historians on \" herstory\".\n\n\nIt will review the literature and see how these women writers\ndemystify the myths about women ingrained in the history books and articles\nwritten by men. \n\n \n\nDemystifying accepted beliefs and social constructs, like gender\nroles, is a part of the structural analytical method of Barthes.\n\n\nAccording to him, the role of myth in an industrialized society is\nnaturally governed by the struggle of classes.\n\n\nThese myths promote the interests of the bourgeois class, and\ntherefore are a part of the structural power of classes in capitalist\nsocieties ( Fiske, 1987: 145). \n\n \n\nHistory books have narratives created by Filipinos based on the\nwritings of foreign male historians from their own Western and dominating\nperspective.\n\n\nTherefore, Filipinos should not accept these books at their face\nvalue but from a native perspective or from a self-perspective (  \npantayong pananaw   ) .\n\n\nWomen experts from different disciplines of the social sciences have\ntaken the initiative to rewrite the history of Filipino women.\n\n\nIt is this rewriting that this paper aims to look at and review to\narrive at the unmasked realities of the role of Filipino women in development\nwhich is ignored in Philippine history.\n\n\nWe shall see how these women experts resurface and demystify these\nmyths in history books, and how readers can become aware of how women are\nmarginalized in our society.\n\n\nThis paper will analyze these unmasked myths by taking from the\nwritings the binary oppositions of the Western perspective dominating these\nhistory books. \n\n \n\nIn the realm of the abstract, there are binary oppositions in the\nWestern view of gender roles, such as the assigning of the workplace as the\nexclusive domain of men and the relegation of women to work within the house.\n\n\nFrom these oppositions, we can see the difference in valuation of men 's\nrole  vis-&agrave;-vis  that of women.\n\n\nThe male standard is also used in assigning values to women 's work,\nsuch as the importance given to women as organizers or active members of\nsocial organizations or during the revolution or war.\n\n\nThese are social myths constructed by the  androgenic\n patriarchal society. \n\n \n\nThis paper will relate the development of power of Filipino women\nfrom her being of equal status to men in the pre-colonial period, to the\nlowering of her status in the Spanish times.\n\n\nIt shall also trace her struggles from the past to the present to\nobtain equality with and recognition from men in our society. \n\n\n  Equality  \n\n \n\nWomen before the advent of the Spaniards in the Philippines\nenjoyed a high position in society.\n\n\nThey were called \"   babaylans  \n\" in the Visayas, \"   catalonans  \n\" by the Tagalogs, \"   doronakit  \n\" by the Isnegs, \"   mangaalisig  \n\" by the Kalingas, \"   manganito  \n\" in Pangasinan, \"   baliana  \n\" in Bicol, \"   mabalian  \n\" by the Bagobos, \"   almonos  \n\" by the B'laans, and \"   aniteras  \n\" by the Gaddangs.\n\n\nThey were the \" spirit mediums &rdquo; who presided over\nanimistic religious ceremonies and rituals of devotion to the  \nanitos   , the wooden images representing dead ancestors who\nwere intermediaries to their god,   Bathala   .\n\n\nTheir elevated status in society was evident in their other functions\nof counselling, even by the   datu   , the head of\nthe tribe, and of healing ( Honculada, 1987).\n\n\nThe power of women in the religious realm was evident from the way\nmale   babaylans   copied their long dresses when the\nlatter exercised their role as priestesses ( Ribadeneyra, 1947:52).\n\n\nMale   babaylans   were called \"\n  asog   \" ( Magos, 1990:5), which in\ncontemporary usage in the Aklanon language of Aklan would mean \"\ntomboy\".\n\n\nThe point of references is the female gender and not the male one (\nGeremia, 1993:2). \n\n \n\nThe distinctive social position of women was also discovered by\nSpanish missionaries when they docked at Cebu.\n\n\nAccording to a male historian, women, like men, can be daughters of\nthe   maharlika   , the local nobility or royalty.\n\n\nThe royal consort in Cebu when they came was Queen Juana ( Morga,\n1958:294; Infante, 1969:152).\n\n\nAnother one mentioned was Queen Sima, but what was peculiar among\nthese women was that they were old or incapable of having children, which is\nwhy society regarded them highly.\n\n\nThe myth is evident here that a single, childless woman is more\nentitled to homage and respect than a mother tied to her husband. \n\n \n\nAlso mentioned in history books is the story of the life of\nPrincess Urduja of Pangasinan.\n\n\nShe is the one referred to as the \"  beautiful amazon\n \" ,  \" brave and knowledgeable in the culture\nand language of Old Asia, skilled in weaponry and leader of an army of women\nwho fought like men. &rdquo;  Although it was the expertise of a\nwoman-in-battle that is being admired in this case, the point of reference is\nagain the man-in-battle - - another contemporary social myth.\n\n\nWarfare is still considered part of \" man 's world &rdquo;\nwhich cannot be penetrated by women, if they don't want to be called\n\" \" amazons. &rdquo; \"\n\n\nEvident in this is the value men place on their exclusive world. \n\n \n\nAlthough the contemporary historians cited here give women an\nelevated role in society, their observations were obviously focused on the\nperiod prior to the coming of the Spaniards.\n\n\nThis was the topic of Camagay in her research on books by historians\nsuch as the \"  History of the Filipino People  \" of\nAgoncillo and Guerrero.\n\n\nThe short sentences cited in this book say  \" men and\nwomen were equal, &rdquo;   \" women had the right to be\nheads of  barangay  , not to use their husband 's name, and\nseek their own property without the husband 's permission &rdquo;  (\nCamagay, 1987:8). \n\n \n\nThese male historians perpetuate the myth that politics and\neconomics were not for women, and even if they enjoyed such conditions, it\nwas not significant because it was contrary to the philosophical line of the\nmale-dominated capitalist society. \n\n\n  Inequality  \n\n \n\nThe history books about the Spanish period were written by friars\nwho manifested, even at the start, their low esteem for Filipino women.\n\n\nThis is evident in this citation from a Spanish friar on the\nFilipina:   \" ...woman is the most monstrous animal in the\nwhole nature, bad-tempered and worse-spoken.\n\n\nTo have this animal in the house is asking for trouble...\n\n\nfor wherever a [ wo]man is, it would seem impossible to have peace\nand quiet.\n\n\nHowever, even this might be tolerated if it was not for the danger\nof unchastity.\n\n\nNot only should the parish priest of   indios \n abstain from employing women in his house, he should not allow them\nto enter it, even if they are paying a call... &rdquo;   ( Dias,\nin Mananzan, 1987:20). \n\n \n\nFrom this we can gather that the Spanish colonizers marginalize\nthe female gender.\n\n\nWe can say that because women were the spiritual and cultural leaders\nin their communities, the Spaniards envied them and stripped them of their\nroles.\n\n\nA noted historian says,  \" Spanish conquerors conspired\nwith the friars in their colonization of the natives, which is why the\n  babaylan   ,   catalonan  \n,   anitera   ,   doronaki  \n, etc. were left without roles in religious rites, beliefs, and lifestyle of\nnative communities &rdquo;  ( Salazar, 1989, cited by Santiago,\n1992:18).\n\n\nThis was also what Landa Jocano referred to as  \"\nduplication of tasks &rdquo;  (  ibid.  ) . \n\n \n\nSantiago clarified that the feminist movement in history and the\nwomen 's movement inside the  Katipunan  both showed the true\nroles of the Filipina in the revolution.\n\n\nHistorians, in mentioning women only in relation to the men in their\nlives, propagate the myth of identifying women relatively.\n\n\nThus, Teodora Alonzo was known as the mother of Dr. Jose Rizal,\nJosefa Gabriela Silang as the wife of Diego Silang, and Gregoria de Jesus as\nthe wife of Andres Bonifacio ( Mangahas, 1993).\n\n\nTheir own contributions to the independence movement have been given\nno greater importance. \n\n \n\nSantiago also looked at the women 's movement in the \nKatipunan  through the analysis of books and articles about the lives\nof the women members, such as the autobiography and two poems written by\nGregoria de Jesus (  Ka  Oriang).\n\n\nShe learned that there was a  Katipunan  branch for\nwomen even before Gregoria de Jesus became one of its members.\n\n\nThe leadership of the organization included Josefa Rizal ( Rizal 's\nsister), president; Gregoria de Jesus, vice president and  Lakambini\n ; Maria Dizon-Santiago, secretary; and Angelica Rizal Lopez, fiscal\n( Cruz, 1989, Santiago:13).\n\n\nHowever, there were no documents to substantiate achievements of\nJosefa Rizal as head of the women 's branch of the  Katipunan \n, but one can see from this hierarchy that Josefa 's position was more\nsignificant than Gregoria 's or  Ka  Oriang 's.\n\n\nSantiago said that despite being the  Katipunan \n Supremo  's wife, she was named only vice president and\nnot president. \n\n \n\nBut  Ka  Oriang showed her courage and dedication\nto women 's rights when she herself defended in the revolutionary court her\nclaim on the attempted rape she suffered in the hands of the Magdalo camp.\n\n\nShe refused to accept the term \" \" raped &rdquo;\n\" in describing what happened to her, but insisted that an attempt\nto do so was made.\n\n\nIn Santiago 's interpretation,  \" she did not believe\nthat her honor was lost in this process, instead, she stood for the right of\nthe woman, the right for defense, the right for the woman 's control of her\nbody and mind in the face of conflicting forces inside a struggle &rdquo;\n ( Santiago:15). \n\n \n\nSantiago mentioned that more activities were participated in by\nwomen in the revolution, and such would have been reported if only the women\nthemselves had a voice in forming its historiography.\n\n\nOne thing which should be given attention in her report is the event\nin 1889 when twenty women of Malolos petitioned Governor General Weyler of\nthe Spanish government to open an Academy of the Spanish Language that would\nadmit women.\n\n\nIn Santiago 's view it was a very important point in the history of\nthe feminist movement in the country ( 19). \n\n \n\nSantiago has disproved the myth that the role of the so-called\n  mujer indigena   ( native woman) in society is\nto be a housewife, embroiderer, nurse to care for children, supporter and\nextension of men, and that she has no voice in the formulation of programs\nand policies, planning of strategies in a political campaign and in\nmanagement or administrative work in the public domain ( 15-16).\n\n\nAccording to the secretary of the women 's branch of the \nKatipunan  , Marina Dizon-Santiago, the women served as \n\" guards at the meetings, spies for the acts of the Spanish soldiers,\nrecorders of decisions/agreements made in a meeting, keepers of important\ndocuments, designers and markers of flags, apart from being servers of coffee\nand food, etc. &rdquo;  ( 16). \n\n \n\nShe also dismissed the myth of the privilege to study and work\noutside the home, which was then for men only.\n\n\nShe stressed that there was a feminist movement in the 19th century\nas determined by two important factors:  \" first, the\nmushrooming of factories that used labor force that utilized mostly women\nworkers, i.e., the tobacco, textile and cloth factories; and second, the long\nperiods of suppression of women, most especially in the field of education,\nthat had imprinted a latent hatred, for deep in their consciousness, they\nremember their important role in the previous society &rdquo;  (\nSantiago:18). \n\n\n  Relative Freedom  \n\n \n\nThe American period had provided relative freedom for Filipino\nwomen.\n\n\nSince free education had been popularized from the first grade to\nhigh school, young girls, rich or poor, were now allowed to study as their\nbrothers did.\n\n\nThe much-harped-on rationale of insufficient money for education and\nthat only men could be educated was no longer true.\n\n\nAnother myth was disproved - - that men are more intelligent than\nwomen, and because of this, they are the only ones who study, since women\nneed no education when they marry and remain in the house. \n\n \n\nSince 1900, night classes were opened in colleges to give an\nopportunity to working students to be able to finish and serve the country\nand especially the government.\n\n\nGender did not become a hindrance here.\n\n\nOne more thing that helped women was the system of  \npensionados   ( scholars) opened for them in 1905.\n\n\nIn this system, promising youths were given scholarships to study\nabroad and serve their country afterwards.\n\n\nLike the men, women were chosen through an examination ( Martinez,\n1987:66).\n\n\nBecause of these benefits, women were able to take a great leap\nforward towards growth.\n\n\nThey now aspired for greater participation in society, including the\nright to vote. \n\n \n\nIn the first election of 1907 for the National Congress, it was\nonly the propertied and educated men who could vote.\n\n\nThis demonstrated the myth that even then, although women could\nstudy, they were just trained as aides to men at home, and not in the field\nof politics.\n\n\nIn 1935, women were yet to be included in the electorate which was\nlimited to educated men 21 and above. \n\n \n\nAs early as 1903, the   Asociacion Feminista\nFilipina   has been formed by a group of prominent women\npromoting only their participation in social services and assigning women to\nvoting precincts and municipal and provincial councils of education.\n\n\nThus, the myth that the home is a woman 's world still prevailed.\n\n\nThe American suffragettes in 1912 brought about the establishment of\nwhat was to become the National Federation of Women 's Clubs of the\nPhilippines.\n\n\nThe women 's suffrage movement spread during that period, spearheaded\nby female college graduates.\n\n\nThe movement was a success and obtained for them their right to vote\nin 1937, two years after the 1935 Constitution was ratified.\n\n\nThey proved wrong the myth of non-participation of women in politics\nand neglect of their education on matters outside the home. \n\n \n\nBut this promising start of the feminist movement in political\nparticipation was not followed.\n\n\nThe members of the NFWC came from the higher class and their\nobjectives tended to preserve the myth circulated by capitalist society that\nwomen should stay at home.\n\n\nTheir projects promoted more the traditional obligations of women\nlike nurturing children, mothercraft, and protection of consumers. \n\n \n\nThe opportunities given to women were achieved only because they\nhad been asked for forcibly and were not given freely.\n\n\nIt was tantamount to giving a favor to a younger sister or relative\nand not to an equal.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "e3c8c824-3343-4557-bb3b-ad56cd9ebec4", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.188807+00:00"}

and, of course, our own Filipino First\npolicy. \n\n \n\nNation-states brought governments to people who needed them and\ntheir emergence represented a quantum leap by humanity away from the\nuniversally autocratic system of royal dynasties and toward the system of\nrepresentative government. \n\n \n\nThus, with the nation-states came a system of welfare legislation\nthat varied according to the political and economic circumstances of each\nnation-state: Unemployment benefits to the unemployed; minimum wage;\nprohibition of child labor; social security for workers and the aged;\nmedicare for the needy; state patronage of the arts; vast network of public\ntransport systems and physical infrastructure; free education; grants and\naids to scientific research and inventions, and a host of others.\n\n\nNone of these would have been available to innumerable races of the\nworld had they not separated from the system of empire or from the system of\ncolonies to which they had originally belonged; if they hadn't in brief,\nconstituted themselves as sovereign nation-states by writing their own\nDeclaration of Independence. \n\n \n\nBut today, this system of nation-states and the doctrine of\nmercantilism are under mortal threat from the powerful adherents of an\ninternational movement out to drive these two interdependent concepts to\nextinction.\n\n\nThat threat is what free trade, globalism and the IMF are about, and\nwe shall discuss that threat in some detail. \n\n \n\nBut before we do, it is important that we take a more detailed\nview of mercantilism than what we have done so far because popular\nunderstanding of it, even in the world of academe, is pitifully limited and\nmisleading.\n\n\nAnd that limited understanding prevents us from appreciating the full\ndimension of the stakes involved in this war of ideologies that has now\ndeeply unsettled Asia. \n\n \n\nThis developmental ideology is widely associated with \"\nprotectionism \" , a term that is essentially defensive in\nconnotation, making it vulnerable to popular criticism.\n\n\nIt is negatively interpreted as a way by which existing domestic\nindustries, many of them inefficient, are shielded from the competition of\nimports through high tariffs and a network of import quotas, prohibitions and\neven environmental and health standards designed to place obstacles to\nforeign goods.\n\n\nProtectionism, however, although an important component of\nmercantilism, is only one aspect of that ideology and is not necessarily the\nmost important. \n\n \n\nMercantilism is more than protectionism.\n\n\nThe doctrine represents a strategic complex of affirmative policy\ntools and practices designed to enable nation-states saddled with\npre-industrial economies to engineer their industrial revolution and catapult\nthemselves to the industrial age, by their own bootstrap. \n\n \n\nPracticed by the most pre-eminent mercantilist of his time, Jean\nBaptiste Colbert, who served as finance minister of France under Louis XIV,\nmercantilism took shape as a conscious and positive strategy to make France\nan industrial and commercial power.\n\n\nAn article on Colbert in the  Encyclopedia Britannica  (\n1964 ed.) said of this program that it  \" gave privileges to a\nnumber of private industries and founded state manufactures. &rdquo; \n\n\nThe economic historian, George Soule, said of Colbert:  \n\" He fostered manufactures and commerce by tariffs on imports, bounties\nto French shipping. ...improved transportation at home.\n\n\nColbert granted monopolies to encourage new enterprises, especially\nin overseas trade, stimulated inventions, established model industries.\n\n\nWithin a decade he doubled the King 's revenues, and made France the\nmost powerful nation in Europe. &rdquo;  ( Ideas of the Great\nEconomists, New American Library).  \n\n \n\nEuropean mercantilism deeply influenced the thinking of America 's\nfirst economic architect, Alexander Hamilton. \n\n \n\nTasked to map out an economic course for his young nation\nHamilton saw, as discussed earlier, the danger and folly of free trade, the\npath suggested by American agricultural interests who wanted free trade with\nBritain.\n\n\nHe opted for the formula applied by the European mercantilists and\nurged his government to promote industry and manufactures through a system of\ntariffs, bounties and subsidies.\n\n\n( Miller,  op. cit.  ) . \n\n \n\nLike every economic nationalist, Hamilton was a consummate\nrealist.\n\n\nHe knew that the business of developing a nation-state was a business\nfar too formidable and serious to be left alone to businessmen.\n\n\nAnd so, like Colbert before him, and the host of Asian statesmen who\nwould eventually come after him, he proposed that government and private\nbusiness join hands in a conscious, coordinated effort to develop the economy\nby  \" fostering the growth of manufactures. &rdquo; \n\n\n \n\nIn pleading that the nation 's industrial development be\nundertaken jointly by government and private business, linked to each other\nunder government guidance and influence, Hamilton reasoned that \n\" the closer the bond between government and businessmen, the better\nfor the state: in such a connection the government would benefit from the\nwealth they produced and it would be in a position to direct their\nacquisitive instincts into channels beneficial to the country as a whole.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nHamilton 's mercantilist proposal for a close bond between\ngovernment and private interests became a prominent principle in the strategy\nof the Asian tigers to industrialize in record time.\n\n\nJapan 's pioneering years at industrialization during the Meiji\nregime in late 19th century leaned heavily on the extensive application of\nthat Hamilton principle.\n\n\nThat explains the pervasive presence of the Japanese state in the\neconomy during the initial years of its industrial program, not only central\nplanner but as entrepreneur and proprietor engaged in virtually every mode of\nenterprise, from manufacturing to mining, trade, agriculture and even the\nvice industries, tobacco and liquor. \n\n \n\nAfter Colbert of France and Hamilton of America came Bismarck of\nGermany.\n\n\nInfluenced by the ideas of Friedrich List, the German economic\nnationalist ( who in turn had been influenced by Hamilton and the American\nexperience), Bismarck went about organizing Germany as an industrial state\naround the mercantilist formula.\n\n\nWhile starting out ideologically as a free trader, his ambition to\nmake Germany the most powerful state in Europe and his search for ways which\nwould bring that about led him inescapably to mercantilism.\n\n\nThe German statesman, however, met formidable opposition from\nconservative landholders who feared that protectionism would work against\ntheir interest.\n\n\nBismarck hurdled the opposition by offering to extend protectionism\nto the farm sector as well. \n\n \n\nAs a biographer said of Bismarck 's ideological conversion and\nhis tactic to persuade the agrarian free traders toward protectionism:\n \" Having abandoned Free Trade, he now wanted thoroughgoing\nProtection, and stirred the sectional interests to bid against each other.\n\n\n\nThe conservative agrarians, for instance--most of them\naristocrats--agreed to the tariff on iron and steel only in exchange for high\ntariff on grain.\"  ( see A. J. P. Taylor, Bismarck, Nel Mentor\nBooks).  \n\n \n\nFrom continental Europe and America, mercantilism spread as a\nworldwide religion and became the battlecry of every nation-state that came\nto being.\n\n\nMexico, Brazil and Argentina in Latin America carried its torch\nthrough economies that industrialized by way of steep tariffs, import\nrestrictions, control of foreign investments, and the proliferation of\nstate-owned enterprises. \n\n \n\nIn Asia, Japan for a long time was the lone but fanatic\npractitioner, and that fanaticism made her the lone but fanatic state in Asia\nbefore the outbreak of the last war.\n\n\nPulverized by American air power, she literally rose from the dead to\nbecome in time the second largest economy in the world.\n\n\nThis spectacular feat she accomplished through her unyielding\npost-war application of mercantilism, of which she continues to be an\nembodiment. \n\n \n\nChina, of course, is the latest, and overpowering, evidence of\nhow mercantilism can radically alter for the better the lives of nations and\npeoples by transporting them to the machine age.\n\n\nThe rise of China as the third largest economy in the world when only\nfifty years ago she was with India, the begging bowl of Asia, is a monumental\ntestament to the transforming impact of the doctrine. \n\n \n\nIt wasn't communism that changed China from a pre-industrial\neconomy to an industrial giant, and from a land once plagued by hunger to one\nthat can now feed more than a billion people, and be a major exporter of food\nbesides. \n\n \n\nIt was mercantilism that did it, and to this day China, along\nwith Taiwan, remains outside the WTO because she refuses to open up her\neconomy to foreign goods and foreign capital to the extent demanded by that\norganization. \n\n \n\nIt is easily seen that the policies and practices associated with\nthe mercantilism of the Asian tigers have their roots in the West, and many\nof those policies and practices remain in force in the West, the most\nprominent of which are the program of agricultural subsidies and the system\nof quotas which limit imports to a specified share of the domestic market.\n\n\n \n\nBut the one ingredient in the package of mercantilist tools which\nthe tigers appear to have developed to a point of perfection in terms of its\nimpact is the mix of state and private capitalism; the combination of private\nand state entrepreneurial initiative.\n\n\nIt is this mix that has given the Asian drive toward industrialism\nits peculiarly Asian kick. \n\n \n\nRecognizing the pressing need to industrialize their economies in\nrecord time, Asian governments have not waited for private capital to\nundertake the pioneering mission it performed in the West.\n\n\nAsian states have invariably taken the initiative to convert feeble\nagrarian economies, which the colonial powers bequeathed to them, into\nindustrial dynamos.\n\n\nFully aware that colonialism left them with a shortage of\nentrepreneurial skills and private capital resources, Asian states on gaining\ntheir independence had to assume the role of capitalists, industrial pioneers\nand business entrepreneurs, and to define the priorities of economic activity\nthrough central planning in order to avoid the wastage of scarce resources\nthat comes with chaotic, unplanned economies. \n\n \n\nAnd in Japan, which was the first Asian state to have\nsuccessfully worked out her industrial revolution through a mix of state and\nprivate capitalism, the tigers saw their appropriate model and precedent.\n\n\n \n\nFrom the history of mercantilism, in the West and in Asia, we see\nthat there is something much more to that economic doctrine than mere\nprotectionism.\n\n\nIt is an affirmative strategy for modernizing obsolete economies, and\nfor spreading the industrial revolution, science and modern technology to\nsocieties that otherwise would remain in the darkness of a pre-industrial\nage. \n\n \n\nThis remarkable doctrine, which came with the nation-state, is\nnow the target of an international movement bent on eradicating from the face\nof the earth and on resurrecting an opposite creed inextricably identified\nwith one of the darkest periods of human history: the period of western\nimperialism, the widespread colonization of peoples, and the deliberate\nsuppression by the western powers of the industrial revolution in their\ncolonies. \n\n \n\nIf the Asian crisis has any positive note at all, it is to have\nalerted us to the fundamental confrontation of our times. \n\n \n\nThe repercussions that lurk behind that confrontation are\nconsiderably deadlier than those which lurked behind the ideological\nconfrontation that was reflected in the Cold War.\n\n\nIt is the confrontation between, on one hand, an economic ideology\nthat, on historical and contemporary evidence, has done so much to make the\nsystem of nation-states a viable and dynamic vehicle for human progress and,\non the other, an economic ideology whose only function in history has been to\nserve as the economic basis of colonialism and the exploitation of peoples.\n\n\n \n\nFree trade in fact has been consistently denounced by the papal\nencyclicals since the 1930s, a point which should be brought home to the\n  Opus Dei   , an agency vigorously pushing for\nfree trade. \n\n \n\nEven as \" theory, &rdquo; a free trade is an utterly\ndiscredited one, as discredited as the Ptolemaic view that the sun revolves\naround the earth.\n\n\nThree earth shaking events before the last world war totally\ndemolished free trade as an economic \" doctrine. &rdquo;", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "978a9c2f-e838-4184-b7b4-c545a69d39c3", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.190416+00:00"}
{"text": "Language Format and Analogical Transfer among Bilingual\nProblem Solvers in the Philippines  \n\n\n Allan B. I. Bernardo \n\n \n\nIs analogical problem solving of bilinguals affected by the\nlanguage in which the problem is given?\n\n\nThree experiments study whether the language used for the problem\naffects analogical transfer between word problems among Filipino-English\nbilinguals.\n\n\nSubjects were given a set of study problems all of which were either\nin Filipino or English.\n\n\nThey were then given a set of analogous transfer-test problems either\nin Filipino or in English.\n\n\nExperiment 1 showed a language-compatibility effect; transfer was\nbetter when the language of the study and transfer-test problems were the\nsame.\n\n\nExperiments 2 to 3 studied the locus of the effect.\n\n\nThe data suggest that language compatibility facilitates the retrieval\nof relevant, superficially similar problem information but does not affect\nthe process of applying the same problem information to the new problem.\n\n\nThe results are discussed in terms of their implications to\nproblem-solving behaviour of bilinguals and to the education of bilingual\nstudents. \n\n\n  INTRODUCTION  \n\n \n\nIn a growing global community, the proportion of bilinguals and\nmultilinguals in the world 's population is increasing fast.\n\n\nMore and more people are being required to think about information in\ndifferent language formats, by choice or out of necessity.\n\n\nCognitive psychologists have long been studying bilingual memory and\nlanguage processing.\n\n\nYet not much has been done to explore how bilinguals engage\nhigher-level cognitive processes like problem solving and reasoning in\ndifferent domains.\n\n\nHow do bilingual people think when they are given problems to solve?\n\n\nIs their problem-solving behaviour affected by whether the problem\ninformation is presented in their first or their second language?\n\n\nDoes his or her mind store and process the problem-solving\ninformation in a manner that is indifferent to the language format?\n\n\nIs the processing affected only by the structural elements of the\nproblem, or does the difference in language format affect problem solving?\n\n\n \n\nAnswers to these questions have practical significance for\neducators of bilingual students; these educators ' success might be affected\ngreatly by whether their materials and instructions are in the bilingual\nstudent 's first or second language.\n\n\nHowever, such answers are also important to those who study thinking,\nparticularly as the question relates to how the mind stores and processes\nphysically different but structurally and functionally similar information.\n\n\n\n  Language and Transfer among Bilinguals  \n\n \n\nOne important aspect of problem solving is the ability to\ntransfer concepts and procedures acquired for one problem in one setting to\nnew problems in new settings.\n\n\nThis ability is particularly useful when new problems that arise have\nsimilar elements to previous problems that have been solved.\n\n\nIn such cases of analogous problems, the problem solver can\neffectively solve the new problem by importing or transferring the solution\nfrom the previous problem.\n\n\nResearch has shown that analogical transfer of this sort is not easy\nfor most problem solvers.\n\n\nTransfer seems to be constrained by numerous elements of the problem,\nthe problem-solving context, and the problem solver. \n\n \n\nAmong bilinguals, one factor that might constrain transfer is the\nlanguage format of the problem.\n\n\nSome anecdotal evidence of bilinguals in the Philippines seems to\nsuggest that language format can in fact influence the transfer of\ninformation.\n\n\nMany Filipinos, who learn numerous concepts and skills after 16 or so\nyears of formal schooling in English, find it difficult to read, write, and\ntalk about the same concepts in Filipino, which is their native language.\n\n\nIt is not uncommon to see students who have learned a lot of very\nspecific problem-solving information in English, who also have a great deal\nof difficulty in expressing and understanding the same information in\nFilipino.\n\n\nSimilarly, in scholarly meetings where Filipino is used as the medium\nof discussion, we often find American- or British-trained Filipino scholars,\nwhose first language is Filipino, but who hesitate and fumble when talking in\nFilipino and then slip comfortably into English.\n\n\nAmong these bilinguals, there seems to be some degree of language\nspecificity when it comes to processing information in certain domains.\n\n\nThis language specificity could be studied as a problem of transfer.\n\n\nIt is possible that the difficulty in using the Filipino language for\ninformation that is learned in English is a demonstration of lack of transfer\nof knowledge from one language context to another. \n\n \n\nPrevious research on analogical problem solving has shown how\nsuperficial problem elements that are totally unrelated to the problem\nstructure can facilitate transfer.\n\n\nFor example, Reed ( 1987) found that students rated a particular\nproblem 's solution as being useful for an analogical problem only when there\nwas a very high level of transparency between the problems; that is, when it\nwas easy for problem solvers to match the corresponding concepts between the\nanalogous problems.\n\n\nIn Reed 's study, transparency was highest among problems that had\nsimilar superficial features ( i.e. story contexts) in addition to having\nanalogous problem structures.\n\n\nSeveral others (  e.g.  Bassok, 1990; Bassok, Wu,\n& Olseth, 1995; Catambrone & Holyoak, 1989; Haloyoak & Koh, 1987; Novick,\n1988; Ross, 1987, 1989) have also found facilitation of analogical transfer\ndue to factors related to superficial similarities.\n\n\nFor bilingual problem solvers, one can think of the problem 's\nlanguage format as a superficial problem-solving element that can affect\nanalogical transfer.\n\n\nIt is within this general framework that the relationship between\nlanguage and analogical transfer was studied. \n\n \n\nThis study is an enquiry into effects of using the bilingual 's\nfirst or second language in the transfer of information between analogous\nword problems in mathematics.\n\n\nIn particular, it is an enquiry into the effects of using Filipino or\nEnglish on the transfer of analogical information between word problems in\nprobability among Filipino-English bilinguals.\n\n\nThe study does not look into how structural differences between two\nlanguages affect analogical problem solving.\n\n\nRather, the study focuses on the effects of language format\ndifferences on transfer of information.\n\n\nThe study further addresses the matter of the locus of the effect of\nlanguage format on analogical transfer.\n\n\nThere are several components in the process of transfer ( see,\n e.g.  , the models of Hoyoak, Novick, & Melz, 1994; Reed,\n1987), and language similarity can affect any or all of these components.\n\n\nIn particular, language can affect the access and the use of\nanalogous problem information.\n\n\n\" Access \" refers to the retrieval of the prior\nproblem-solving episode from which the analogous problem information can be\nderived.\n\n\nOn the other hand, \" use \" refers to the\ninstantiation or adaptation of the retrieved analogous information to the new\nproblem.\n\n\nAlthough these two components are related, they are very distinct\nprocesses.\n\n\nFor example, it is possible that the problem solver correctly\naccessed the prior analogous problem but could not correctly use the problem\ninformation to solve the new problem.\n\n\nLikewise, a problem solver could have difficulty accessing prior\nproblem information that is otherwise easy to adapt to the new problem.\n\n\nIndeed, Ross ( 1987, 1989) earlier showed that specific types of\nsuperficial similarity ( e.g., story lines, object correspondences, etc.)\nhave distinct effects on the components of access and use.\n\n\nIn this regard, it is possible that language format affects transfer\nby way of facilitating either easier retrieval of the appropriate prior\nproblem or the adaptation of the problem information for the new problem.\n\n\n\n  Overview of Experiments  \n\n \n\nIn the three experiments reported, Filipino-English bilingual\nsubjects were given problems in basic probability.\n\n\nSubjects were first given a set of study problems followed by a set\nof transfer-test problems.\n\n\nThe study problems included the text of the problem, a description of\nthe quantitative relations in the problem and of the relevant principles,\nconcepts, and equations, and a worked-out solution for the problem.\n\n\nThe transfer-text problems consisted of a set of analogous problems\nthat were very similar in surface content to the corresponding study\nproblems.\n\n\nThe subjects were instructed to solve these transfer-test problems\nwithout directly referring to the study problems. \n\n \n\nThe subjects were given study problems and transfer-text problems\neither in Filipino or in English.\n\n\nSubjects ' performance in the transfer-test problems was coded in\nterms of whether there was transfer of information from the corresponding\nstudy problem.\n\n\nExperiment 1 was designed to demonstrate whether the language used to\nexpress the study and transfer-test problems has any effect on analogical\ntransfer.\n\n\nIn particular, the experiment was designed to demonstrate a\nlanguage-compatibility effect.\n\n\nExperiments 2 and 3 were designed to determine the locus of the\nlanguage-compatibility effect; that is, whether using the same language to\nexpress the study and transfer-test problems facilitates either the access or\nthe use of the analogous problem information. \n\n\n  EXPERIMENT 1  \n\n \n\nExperiment 1 is basically a replication of an earlier study (\nBernardo, 1994a) that showed trends suggesting a language-compatibility\neffect in analogical transfer with word problems.\n\n\nFor the study phase, some subjects were given the set of study\nproblems in Filipino and the rest were given the problem in English.\n\n\nFor the transfer-test phase, all subjects were given half of the\nproblems in Filipino and the other half in English. \n\n\n  Method  \n\n \n\n  Subjects.  \n\n\nSixty-four General Psychology students at the University of the\nPhilippines, Diliman participated in this experiment as part of a class\nrequirement.\n\n\nAll subjects were bilingual in Filipino and English, reporting\nFilipino as the language used at home and English as the main language used\nin mathematics education.\n\n\nHalf of the subjects were randomly assigned to the Filipino-study\ncondition, and the rest to the English-study condition. \n\n \n\nThe subjects were asked to rate their proficiency in speaking,\nreading, and writing in Filipino and in English in a scale of 1 to 7 ( 1 =\nnot at all proficient; 7 = very proficient).\n\n\nThe self-ratings in the three language skills were combined to create\na composite proficiency self-rating score in the two languages.\n\n\nThe mean proficiency scores of the subjects in the Filipino-study\ncondition were 5.08 (  SE  = 0.14) in Filipino and 5.31 (  SE\n = 0.11) in English.\n\n\nFor the subjects in the English study condition the corresponding\nmeans were 5.29 (  SE  = 0.16) and 5.45 (  SE  = 0.14),\nrespectively.\n\n\nThe scores for both study-condition groups were analyzed using a 2x2\nANOVA for mixed-factorial designs with study condition as between-group\nfactor and language as within-group factor.\n\n\nThe analysis revealed no systematic differences in proficiency\nbetween the two groups,  F  ( 1, 62) = 1.13,  MSe  = 0.84,\n P  &gt; .10; neither was there any advantage in proficiency in\neither language,  F  ( 1,62) = 2.67,  MSe  = 0.45,  P\n &gt; .10.\n\n\nThere was also no interaction effect between the two factors,  F\n &lt; 1.0.\n\n\nThese null results suggest that there were no gross differences in\nthe perceived proficiency in Filipino and in English across the two study\nconditions. \n\n \n\n  Materials   .\n\n\nWord problems in probability were created in four problem types:\nconjunction problem with independent events, conjunction problem with\ndependent events, disjunction problems with exclusive events, disjunction\nproblems with intersecting events ( see Appendix A for examples of problems).\n\n\nProbability problems were chosen to ensure that subjects had no\nextensive prior experience in the problem domain ( this was verified in the\nbackground questionnaire), yet the problems were easy enough for those with a\nbackground in algebra.\n\n\nFour versions of each problem type were created; each version had a\ndifferent surface content.\n\n\nOne version of each of the four problem types was combined to form a\nstudy set, making four sets of four study problems. \n\n \n\nAll study problems were first written in English.\n\n\nThe English problems were than translated into Filipino by a research\nassistant who was proficient in both languages.\n\n\nTo ensure that the Filipino and English versions were equivalent, the\nFilipino translations were translated back into English by another research\nassistant. \n\n \n\nFor the transfer-test problems, a superficially similar analogous\nproblem was created for each of the study problems ( see Appendix B for an\nexample).\n\n\nHalf of these problems were written in Filipino and half were in\nEnglish.\n\n\nUsing a counter-balancing procedure, it was ensured that across the\nfour sets of study problems each problem type had an equal probability of\nhaving a transfer-test problem in Filipino or in English. \n\n \n\nEach study problem was typed on a separate sheet.\n\n\nEach transfer-test problem was also typed on a separate sheet, with\nthe problem on the top portion, and the rest of the page left blank for the\nsolutions.\n\n\nThe study problems and the test problems were arranged in a random\norder and combined to form a test booklet.\n\n\nThe test booklet included instructions for the study and test phases,\nand a questionnaire on subjects ' language and mathematics backgrounds.\n\n\nThe instructions and questionnaire were written in Filipino for the\nFilipino-study condition, and in English for the English-study condition.\n\n\nThe two language versions were prepared following the procedures\ndescribed earlier. \n\n \n\n  Procedure   .\n\n\nThe subjects were run in groups not larger than 10.\n\n\nSubjects in one session were randomly assigned to either the\nFilipino-study or English-study condition and given the appropriate test\nbooklet.\n\n\nThey were instructed to read each study problem and to try to learn\nthe material as best they could.\n\n\nThey were encouraged to work through the problems themselves; each\nsubject was given a calculator for this purpose.\n\n\nThey were given 3 minutes to study each problem and they were told\nwhen they had 30 seconds left for each problem.\n\n\nAfter studying the four study problems, the subjects were then asked\nto solve the transfer-test problems without directly referring to the study\nproblems;

Ana III \n\n \n\n At the instance of the Executive, the Philippine Congress has\nprocessed the legislation of the reengineering of the bureaucracy.\n\n\nThis reengineering is not simply a reorganization; at its core is the\nassertion of a  \" new paradigm of governance. \" \n\n\nThe new paradigm is actually an adoption of the principle of \"\nsteering rather than rowing. \"\n\n\nThe bone of contention is the interpretation and the contextualization\nof  \" steering rather than rowing. &rdquo; \n\n\nCurrent efforts to reengineer the Philippine bureaucracy constitute\nattempts at following the global vogue without appreciating specific contexts\nand conditions.  \n\n \n\nThe 3Rs - -  i.e.  \" reinventing,\nreengineering, and redefining \" - - are the new buzzwords to\ndescribe the intellectual, political, and organizational trends in government\nand governance. \n\n \n\nOsborne and Gaebler 's \"  Reinventing Government \n\" , first published in 1993, was some sort of trailblazer though the\nauthors themselves acknowledge their work was a product and synthesis of the\nideas and experiences of other people. \n\n\nThe Philippines has jumped into the bandwagon of reinventing\ngovernment.\n\n\nMore to the point, the Ramos administration wants to legislate\nreinventing and reengineering. \n\n \n\nIn the House of Representatives, the Committee on Government\nReorganization and the Committee on Appropriations have recommended the\napproval of House Bill No. 5671 titled: \" \" An Act to\nReorganize the Executive Departments, Bureaus, Offices, and other\nInstrumentalities of the Government, including Government-Owned or Controlled\nCorporations. &rdquo; \" \n\n\n \" In the Senate, similar bills are up for deliberation\nat the committee level. \n\n\nAll the bills draw heavily from \" \" Re-engineering the\nBureaucracy for Better Governance: Principles and Parameters &rdquo;\n\" ( PCSB 1995), henceforth called \" \" Reengineering.\n&rdquo; \"   \n\n\n  Broadening the Perspective  \n\n \n\nFrom an international perspective, the impetus to reinvent\ngovernment or reengineer the public sector is the globalization of capital\nand technology and its impact on national economies. \n\n \n\nYet, the private sector was the first to reengineer.\n\n\nAfter all, the private sector is the most affected by globalization\nand heightened competition.\n\n\nPrivate corporations, thanks to their natural ability to adapt to\nmarket signals, set in motion the processes of reorganizing and retooling.\n\n\nThis, in turn, increased the demand for Peter Drucker to provide a\nnew universe for management theory and practice in the era of globalization.\n\n\n \n\nAt first blush, the need for the public sector to reinvent and\nreengineer in response to globalization was not evident.\n\n\nTo quote Halachmi and Bouckaert ( 1995:323):  \n\n \n\nOsborne and Gaebler ( 1993:33) further explain:  \n\n \n\nFrom another angle, nation-states have to adjust to the forces\ndominant in globalization.\n\n\nPrivate finance and transnational corporations have gained the upper\nhand in the inexorable globalization process.\n\n\nA study written by Sarah Anderson and John Cavanagh ( 1996) for the\nInstitute for Policy Studies, titled \"  The Top 200 \n\" , says that private corporations make up the majority of the world 's\ntop 100 economies.  \n\n \n\nTransnational corporations, too, have proven their capability to\nsubordinate nation-states.\n\n\nNote, for example, the sensitivity of nation-states ( including the\ndeveloped ones) to the volatile movement of international capital.\n\n\nThe Mexican crisis that erupted in December 1994--even as it was\nprimarily caused by endogenous factors--is nevertheless illustrative of how\nglobal capital can first bring down and then resuscitate a national economy.\n\n\n \n\nThe dominance of private capital has likewise led to the\nonslaught of privatization.\n\n\nIt is important to stress that the worldwide \" privatization\nmovement &rdquo; has triggered a crisis in public administration ( Haque:\n1996: 510-36).\n\n\nWorse, \" the privatization movement &rdquo; is armed with an\nideology that is anti-public service.\n\n\nHaque ( 1996: 514) says:  \" The attack on the public\nservice has generated both political pressure and economic interest to reduce\nits scope and role and reorient its norms and objectives. &rdquo; \n\n\n \n\nStrangely, the globalization factor, including the threat it\nbrings, is missing from the Philippine initiative to reinvent government and\nreengineer the bureaucracy.\n\n\nThe key documents, including \" \" Re-engineering,\n&rdquo; \" the mother of all documents, as well as the recommended\nHouse Bill ( House Bill No. 5671) and several Senate Bills do not have a word\non the impact of globalization. \n\n\nIs this a simple inadvertent omission?\n\n\nOr is this a reflection of a narrow, insular perspective? \n\n \n\nWhatever it is, it already provides a glimpse of the quality--in\nparticular, the rigor--of the formulation of the principles and parameters\nbehind the reengineering effort. \n\n \n\nBut before delving into that, it is necessary to describe what\nthe Philippine version of reengineering the bureaucracy is. \n\n\n  An Introduction to Reengineering the Philippine\nBureaucracy  \n\n \n\nThe document \" \" Re-engineering &rdquo; \"\nis first of all an affirmation of  \" a new paradigm of\ngovernance. &rdquo; \n\n\nThe opening statement of Chapter 1 goes:\n\n  Good government can no longer be achieved simply by working more,\nharder, longer, and faster. \n\n\nEffective governance can no longer be realized simply by assuming\nthe main responsibility for all societal concerns.\n\n\nEfficient government administration can no longer be maintained\nsimply by correcting the superficial symptoms of a dysfunctioning bureaucracy\n ( PCSB 1995:1).  \n\n \n\nWith that as premise, \" \" Re-engineering &rdquo;\n\" puts forward a new set of principles of governance, namely: ( 1)\nfrugality and prioritization, ( 2) steering, and ( 3) compartmentalization (\nPCSB 1995: 2-18).\n\n\nFrom these principles flow the definition and explanation of the\nfollowing:\n\n\n- Government 's main responsibilities\n\n\n- Government 's relationship with the private sector\n\n\n- Government intervention and regulation\n\n\n- Provision of public goods\n\n\n- Distribution of functions among levels of government\n\n\n- Administrative structural framework \n\n \n\nAlthough the reorganization of the bureaucracy, specifically the\nexecutive branch, is the ultimate objective, the most problematic issues\nrevolve around the espousal of a new philosophy, or what \" \"\nRe-engineering &rdquo; \" calls a new vision, a new paradigm of\ngovernance. \n\n \n\nProfessor Ma. Concepcion P. Alfiler of the UP College of Public\nAdministration has noted that what makes the proposed reengineering law\nqualitatively different from past reorganization laws is that the former\nadvances a fundamental philosophy. \n\n\nThe heart of the issue--or shall we say the controversy--is the\nphilosophy itself together with the ambiguity of the terms and parameters.\n \n\n \n\nIn this regard, the reorganization of the bureaucracy \nper se  is not a problem.\n\n\nThe government invariably has to respond to changing social, economic\nand political conditions both on the national and international fronts.\n\n\nAlong this line, to quote Root ( 1995: 9),  [ g]ood policies\nby themselves are insufficient if doubts about the quality of public sector\nmanagement undermine social support for the policies. \n\n\nIn other words, to capably address the new conditions, the reform of\nadministrative systems, including reorganization, is necessary. \n\n\n  Immediate Relevance of Reengineering  \n\n \n\nOff the bat, one can cite a number of internal and external\nfactors that make reorganization at this time relevant: the decentralization\nof power and devolution of services, the rise of credible nongovernmental\norganizations ( NGOs) and civil society institutions, the increasing demand\nfor public goods amid the low tax collection effort, the information\nrevolution, the integration of regional economies, and globalization itself.\n\n\n \n\nGovernment reorganization has occurred five times in the\npost-independence period, an average of one reorganization every eight years\n( Cola 1993:382).\n\n\nThe last reorganization took effect a decade ago, during the\ntransition period of Aquino 's revolutionary government.  \n\n \n\nFurthermore, the ostensible goals of reorganization in 1946,\n1950, 1954, 1968, and 1986 are more or less the same: economy and efficiency\nand at times, simplicity and effectiveness ( Cola 1993: 385).\n\n\nA variable goal common in the 1968 and 1986 reorganization is to\nattune the bureaucracy to economic and social development ( Cola 1993: 385).\n\n\nThe goals of the new restructuring proposal--now pending in\nCongress--are no different from the above though with a different context.\n\n\n \n\nThat the reengineering program is seeking legislation is likewise\nregular.\n\n\nCola ( 1993: 383) states that the requirements for reorganization\n \" are provided through an enabling act which also defines the\nwork that the reorganization must accomplish. \"  \n\n\nIn consonance with this, the Department of Budget and Management has\nopined that the power to reorganize is legislative unless delegated.  9\n \n\n \n\nIn a word, the proposed reorganization ( or reengineering)\nprogram is nothing extraordinary, if not for its philosophy and \n\" new paradigm of governance. &rdquo; \n\n\nThe significance then of passing a law on reengineering the\nbureaucracy is:\n\n  In the absence of a law which enshrines the Principles of\nGovernance and identifies the power, scope, functions, and organization of\ngovernment, there will be no philosophical basis for future reorganization\nand streamlining efforts  ( PCSB n.d.: 26). \n\n\n  The Problem of Defining the Philosophy  \n\n \n\nThe philosophy of this new reengineering program borrows\nsubstantially from Osborne and Gaebler 's \"  Reinventing\nGovernment  \" .\n\n\nOsborne and Gaebler ( 1993:25) define catalytic government as \n\" steering rather than rowing.\"  \n\n \n\nA central message of \" \" Re-engineering &rdquo;\n\" ( PCSB 1995: 5) is thus:  \" The role of the national\ngovernment in the sectors shall be to steer rather than to row.\" \n\n\n \n\nThe bills in Congress say the same thing.\n\n\nHouse Bill No. 5671 states:  \" The proper role of\ngovernment in the various sectors shall be on steering and mobilizing the\ninstruments that contribute to achieving sectoral objectives. &rdquo;\n\n\n\nThe Shahani Bill ( S. B. No. 1374) says:  \" The role of\nthe national government in the sectors shall be to steer rather than to row.\n&rdquo; \n\n\nIn the Ople Bill ( S.B. No. 636),  \" The proper role of\ngovernment in the various sectors shall be steering and mobilizing the\ninstruments that contribute in the achievement of sectoral objectives.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThe principle of steering is unquestionable.\n\n\nThe problem with Philippine reengineering, however, is found in the\ninterpretation, contextualization, and application of the principle.\n\n\nOne must note that the formulations of Osborne and Gaebler possess\nsignificant nuances, contexts, and qualifications ( Sta. Ana 1996: 3). \n\n \n\nIn elaborating the principle of steering, \" \"\nRe-engineering &rdquo; \" defines the government relationship with\nthe private sector ( PCSB 1995:6):\n\n\na) Government will strive to let the market operate by itself.\n\n\nIt will establish a stable policy environment, set minimum and\nappropriate rules and provide information, rather than directly engage in the\nprovision and production of goods and services;\n\n\nb) The private sector will be encouraged to share, to the extent\npossible, in the responsibility and the cost of the provision of public goods\nand services;\n\n\nc) The private sector will assume the primary responsibility for the\nproduction of public goods and services. \n\n \n\nThe Bills in Congress echo the same line.\n\n\nHouse Bill No. 5671 declares:  \" To the extent possible,\ngovernment shall limit direct provision and productions ( sic) of public\ngoods and encourage more private sector participation. &rdquo; \n\n\nThe Shahani Bill ( S.B. No. 1374), arguably the more comprehensive\nand elaborative bill in the Senate, states under the rubric of the principle\nof steering:  \" The government shall, to the extent possible,\nassume an indirect role in the sectors, intervening through market\nmechanisms. \n\n\nIt shall likewise find ways to create conditions to stimulate more\nprivate sector participation. &rdquo;  \n\n\nUncannily, the Drilon Bill ( S.B. No. 1111) contains the same words\nand phrases used by Shahani ( or is it the other way around?): \n\" the State shall [ a]ssume an indirect role in the sectors,\nintervening through market mechanisms creating thereby conditions to\nstimulate more private sectoral participations ( sic). &rdquo;  \n\n\n\nHow government defines its relationship with the private sector--as\nenumerated above--is in a manner tantamount to subordinating government to\nthe market and the private sector.\n\n\nNowhere in \"  Reinventing Government  \" can\none find a statement agreeing  \" to let the market operate by\nitself\"  or let the private sector  \" assume the primary\nresponsibility for the production of public goods and services.\" \n\n\n \n\nOn the contrary, Osborne and Gaebler ( 1993:35) stress:  \n\n \n\nIn other words, \"  Reinventing Government \n\" ( Osborne and Gaebler 1993:35-37) prefers  \" steering\norganizations that shop around\"  for multiple service providers, \nincluding the public sector  , to promote comprehensive solutions,\nspecialization, flexibility, experimentation, and accountability.\n\n\nSteering is separated from rowing in order that the people involved\nin policymaking can focus on developing holistic, comprehensive strategies\nand mobilizing \" many different oarsmen ( oarspeople?), &rdquo;\ncomposed of nongovernment and government personnel, to carry out the\nstrategies. \n\n \n\nTo put it another way, \"  Reinventing Government\n \" dismisses the idea that  \" government cannot\ncompete with business. &rdquo; \n\n\nFurther:  \" Not only can it compete, it can win.\"\n\n\n\nIn identifying the types of competition, it includes \" public\nversus private competition &rdquo; and \" public versus public\ncompetition. &rdquo;\n\n\nIt likewise dwells on government agencies competing for internal\ngovernment services ( Osborne and Gaebler 1993:84-92). \n\n \n\nAll this, to be sure, does not in any way indicate that \n\" the private sector will assume the primary responsibility for the\nproduction of goods and services.\" \n\n\nNeither does it suggest that government  \" shall limit\nthe direct provision of goods\"  and  \" assume an\nindirect role in the sectors. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nFurthermore, while \"  Reinventing Government \n\" advocates a market-oriented government, it frowns on \n\" letting the market operate by itself\"  ( Osborne and Gaebler\n1993: 282-84).\n\n\nThe key is for governments to  \" use their immense \nleverage  to structure the market.\" \n\n\nOsborne and Gaebler clarify this   \" has nothing to\ndo with conservative calls to 'leave it to the market,'  however. \n\n\n Structuring the market to achieve a public purpose is in fact\nthe opposite of leaving matters to the 'free market'  ( italics\nmine)--it is a form of  intervention  in the market. &rdquo; \n \n\n \n\nIn a word then, even if the current Philippine version of\nreengineering the bureaucracy adopts in words the progressive principle of\nsteering, it does not give justice to the substance of the principle.\n\n\nIn fact, it distorts the meaning of the principle.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "bf966dfb-6c13-4524-a316-3d0e457a48e8", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.192974+00:00"}
{"text": "Net Social Benefits of Emigration from the Perspective of\nthe Source Country: Do Overseas Filipinos Really Benefit the Philippines?\n \n\n\n Edgard R. Rodriguez \n\n \n\nWho benefits from international migration?\n\n\nFrom the perspective of individual migrants, migration to a\nhigher-wage setting represents an unambiguous improvement in their individual\nwelfare  ex-ante  ( even though unexpected poor working\nconditions abroad can obviously reduce welfare  ex-post \n ) .\n\n\nEvery year, thousands of migrants leave the Philippines for the first\ntime, either temporarily or permanently.\n\n\nPhilippine migrants are evidently attracted by higher wages overseas.\n\n\nHowever, does the Philippines, as a whole, benefit from emigration?\n\n\nThe answer to this question is not self-evident, especially as the\nsocial net benefits of emigration are not clear.\n\n\nDepending on the answer, governments may decide to limit or encourage\nemigration of their nationals. \n\n \n\nBut whose welfare should governments protect?\n\n\nThe definition of a reference group whose welfare governments are\nmandated to maximize is not always clear.\n\n\nIf the reference group is comprised of migrants overseas, then\ngovernments in source countries will attempt to protect them if their\n ex-post  welfare is threatened by conditions overseas.\n\n\nHowever, this assistance is limited by the sovereignty of the host\ncountries where migrants choose to go.\n\n\nAlthough active legal protection of their nationals can be provided\nby source countries, even international organizations face the constraints of\nsovereign host states.\n\n\nOrganizations such as the International Labor Office ( ILO) have\nsupported several normative instruments concerning the welfare of migrant\nworkers, but these have not all been ratified by host countries ( ILO\n1992:26-32). \n\n \n\nOn the other hand, the reference group may be the important and\nsizeable group composed of the non-migrant population which remains within\nthe jurisdiction of source countries.\n\n\nWithin the borders of a source country, intervention on emigration is\nthe government 's prerogative.\n\n\nHowever, the type of intervention depends on whether or not\nemigration improves the social welfare of non-migrants.\n\n\nIf it does, the government can decide to follow an active or a\npassive role.\n\n\nBut if emigration reduces social welfare, governments may choose a\nclosed-door policy.\n\n\nAny policy intervention should be carefully considered because some\npolicies may exacerbate costs rather than increase benefits to non-migrants.\n\n\n \n\nWhen considering the social welfare of residents, a number of\nbenefits and costs should be taken into account.\n\n\nMigrants ' remittances to families at home represent significant\nbenefits to the country, but emigration entails costs as well.\n\n\nThese social costs can be expressed in terms of output losses, the\nmagnitudes of which will depend on the structure of the source economy (\nwhether the economy faces labor surplus or not) and the type of emigrants (\nwhether they are skilled or unskilled).\n\n\nMoreover, remittances may represent increased income inequality\nwithin the country, which adds costs in terms of greater inefficiency or\nunfairness in the source economy.\n\n\nOther social costs are harder to evaluate, but their magnitude should\nalso be assessed ( for example, the cost of broken families). \n\n \n\nTo shed light on these issues and concerns, this article\ndiscusses the effects of emigration on the non-migrant population in the\nPhilippines.\n\n\nIt has four major sections.\n\n\nSection 1 reviews the factors affecting international migration and\nprovides an overview of trends in emigration, the profile of migrants, and\ntheir remittances.\n\n\nSection 2 examines the benefits and costs of international migration,\nfocusing first on official remittances, followed by a discussion of other\nbenefits and costs of emigration.\n\n\nSection 3 discusses the government 's role in regulating\ninternational emigration from the Philippines.\n\n\nBroad policy recommendations conclude the paper. \n\n\n  INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION: \" PUSH AND PULL &rdquo;\nFACTORS  \n\n\n  \" Push &rdquo; factors: Sluggish domestic labor\nmarkets  \n\n \n\nEmigration reflects labor market conditions in the source\ncountry.\n\n\nConditions of slow growth in employment and of low wages, which\nindicate strong \" push &rdquo; factors and impel international\nmigration, continue to describe labor market conditions in the Philippines in\nthe 1990s.\n\n\nPhilippine labor markets have undergone very limited structural\ntransformation away from agriculture into high-productivity sectors such as\nmanufacturing.\n\n\nIn 1960, employment was concentrated in agriculture and\nmanufacturing.\n\n\nBy 1990, agriculture and other lower-productivity sectors, such as\ncommunity services and wholesale trade, had already surpassed manufacturing\nas the most important job provider.\n\n\nManufacturing accounted for 12.1 percent of all employed workers in\n1960, but in 1990 its share of all employed workers was down to only 9.7\npercent ( NSO 1992a:Table 15.3a).\n\n\nIn addition, trends in real wages also appear disappointing.\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, real wage rates had not recovered to levels\nprevalent during the early 1970s as a result of a stagnant economy and the\nrapid increase in the size of the labor force ( World Bank 1993:373). \n\n \n\nIn the period under consideration, domestic absorption of labor\ndeteriorated.\n\n\nFirst, unemployment rates ( above 10 percent) were on the rise at the\nbeginning of this decade.\n\n\nWith almost one-fifth of the labor force underemployed, the figure\nfor underemployment also pointed at the same direction.\n\n\nThe unemployment rate is associated with emigration because this\nfigure, especially in developing countries, not only indicates weak labor\nmarkets but also the conditions faced by a more skilled and urban labor\nforce.\n\n\nThis labor force represents the pool of potential international\nmigrants.\n\n\nBetween 1975 and 1993, urban unemployment rates in the Philippines\nsuggest a positive relationship with emigration flows ( see Figure 1).\n\n\nHowever, while Philippine domestic conditions have encouraged the\nwillingness to emigrate among its citizens, host countries ultimately decide\nwhich level of immigration to take, depending on their own economic and\npolitical circumstances. \n\n\n  \" Pull &rdquo; factors: changing international labor\nmarkets  \n\n \n\nSince the beginning of this century, Philippine participation in\ninternational labor markets has increased and has followed the global trend\nfrom more settlement-oriented to more temporary emigration.\n\n\nMost of the permanent migration of Philippine nationals has been to\nthe United States, a migration stream with a long history of labor movements\nthat started prior to Philippine independence in 1946.\n\n\nIn the early 1900s, prohibition in the U.S. against importing labor\nfrom China or Japan caused the U.S. to turn to the Philippines to alleviate\nlabor shortages in Hawaii, Guam, and California.\n\n\nAfter the Second World War, Filipino workers were recruited for the\nreconstruction of U.S. bases in the Pacific.\n\n\nIn 1965, the U.S. relaxed restrictions on race and country of origin,\nmaking a wider variety of skilled labor from the Philippines eligible for\nemigration.\n\n\nBy 1980, Filipino migrants in the U.S. had already become the largest\nAsian community and the second most prosperous community among the\nforeign-born. \n\n\nA decade later, the number of Filipinos in the U.S. had doubled,\nrepresenting 60 percent of all overseas Filipinos ( Rodriguez and Horton,\nforthcoming).\n\n\nToday, the U.S. still represents the most important destination of\npermanent migrants. \n\n \n\nIn general, however, the existence of quotas for immigrants in\nhost countries keeps permanent migrants a small, selected group.\n\n\nIn 1991, only nine percent of all emigrants left the Philippines as\npermanent migrants, and this category also showed a low average annual growth\nof 2.3 percent between 1981 and 1991 ( NSO 1992a; see Figure 2).\n\n\nContract labor, on the other hand, began in the 1970s to open new\nopportunities for migration, at least temporarily, and this flow of migrants\nhas since expanded.\n\n\nLand-based and sea-based migrants posted a growth rate of 7.7 percent\nper annum between 1981 and 1991 ( Figure 2).\n\n\nIn 1991, of the 665,000 emigrants, 72 percent were land-based while\n19 percent were sea-based contract workers.\n\n\nThe latter group also accounted for almost one-fifth of the total\ncrew population worldwide ( POEA 1991:9).  \n\n \n\nContract labor stems from increases in labor demand, and the\nlocation of this demand determines where migrants go.\n\n\nLower oil prices and the consequent recession in the Gulf states have\nslowed down migration to that region; nonetheless, in absolute terms it has\nremained the most important destination for Philippine contract workers.\n\n\nThe number of migrants to the Gulf states grew 4.7 percent per year\nonly on average between 1981 and 1991, while Asia-bound migrants increased\nannually by 18.6 percent on average during the same period.\n\n\nBooming Asian economies attracted almost 20 percent of the total\noutflow of migrants in 1991.\n\n\nIf present trends continue, by the end of the century the numbers of\nPhilippine migrants leaving for Asian countries would equal those leaving for\nthe Gulf states. \n\n\n  \" Pull &rdquo; factors: wages overseas  \n\n \n\nWhat draws migrants to leave the Philippines in large numbers?\n\n\nUndoubtedly, incomes overseas which are significantly higher than in\nthe Philippines represent a strong incentive to move.\n\n\nGross National Product ( GNP)  per capita  in Hong\nKong, Japan, Saudi Arabia, or Singapore are at least 10 times that of the\nPhilippines, where GNP  per capita  in 1992 was\nUS&dollar;770 only ( World Bank 1994).\n\n\nBut GNP figures may only be crude estimates of potential earnings\nabroad.\n\n\nTo arrive at a better gauge of wage differentials, comparisons were\nmade involving reported actual wages of male migrants by occupation in Japan,\nSaudi Arabia, Singapore, as well as in the Philippines using unpublished data\non contracts from the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration ( POEA).\n\n\n \n\nAs shown in Figure 3, the data suggest that, after accounting for\nsome characteristics such as occupation, host country, and sex, wages of\nPhilippine migrants are substantially higher overseas ( up to 16 times more)\nthan wages in the Philippines.\n\n\nOf these countries, Japan offers the highest wages in all\noccupational categories except transport operators.\n\n\nHowever, because these figures do not take into account cost of\nliving in the host country, the differentials may actually be lower.\n\n\nWithin occupations, entertainers show the highest wage levels;\ndomestic helpers, some of the lowest.\n\n\nBut such occupations as that of domestic helpers may more likely be\nsupplemented by in-kind wage benefits ( i.e., room and board) which are not\nincluded in these figures. \n\n \n\nNote that, as migrants need not have the same occupation in the\nPhilippines and abroad, occupational shifts are known to occur and further\nreveal migrants ' ability to maximize their expected individual gains through\nmigration.\n\n\nMoreover, when wages of male workers are compared to women 's wages,\nthe data show that, in some cases, female workers are paid more than their\nmale counterparts, a reflection, in part, of the characteristics of the host\ncountry 's labor market.\n\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, for instance, the fact that local women do not\nparticipate in the labor force results in a relative scarcity that translates\ninto higher wages for foreign female workers compared with wages for foreign\nmale workers, at least in some occupations. \n\n \n\nOver time, wages have been declining in some host countries, and\nimmigration controls have increased in others.\n\n\nDespite increases in individual costs of migration, the number of\nmigrants is on the rise, indicating the strong dominance of push factors in\nPhilippine migration.\n\n\nFor instance, lower oil prices produced an economic recession during\nthe 1980s in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\nThis recession, together with stiffer competition from other\nmigrant-sending countries, seems to have driven wages downwards.\n\n\nFigure 4 shows that between 1982 and 1990 current GDP  per\ncapita  in Saudi Arabia dropped by more than half ( database from\nthe World Bank).\n\n\nInstead of a reduction in immigrant flows of contract workers, during\nthis period annual arrivals from the Philippines in this oil-producing state\nremained at around 200,000 ( Central Department of Statistics of Saudi\nArabia, several issues).\n\n\nFurthermore, in Japan migration costs have risen for some types of\nmigrants;

Cabrera \n\n \n\n Abstract  .\n\n\nRipamficin is a drug which is rapidly bactericidal against \n Mycobacterium tuberculosis   .\n\n\nIt is used in the short course chemotherapy of

detection of the presence of resistance to ripamficin in strains of\n M. tuberculosis  . \n\n \n\n\n Keyword   .\n\n\nRipamficin,   M. tuberculosis   ,\nmolecular analysis. \n\n\n  INTRODUCTION  \n\n \n\nInfectious diseases remain the largest cause of death in the\nworld today and among the infectious diseases, tuberculosis is the leading\ncause of mortality  .\n\n\nAnnually, more than three million deaths and one-fourth of the world 's\npreventable deaths result from this disease.\n\n\nThe thirty-year declining trend in the incidence of tuberculosis in\nthe United States was dramatically reversed in 1985 primarily as a result of\nthe acquired immunodeficiency syndrome pandemic  .\n\n\nTo this can be added the role played by increased poverty,\nhomelessness and inadequate health care in certain cities  . \n\n \n\nThe use of modern chemotherapy, if properly prescribed and\nadministered is said to cure 98% to 99% of cases previously untreated\npulmonary tuberculosis if the disease is caused by drug susceptible \n M. tuberculosis    .\n\n\nHowever, there has been an alarming emergence of drug resistant\nisolates, many of which are resistant to multiple drugs  .\n\n\nMany of these strains have acquired resistance to almost all first\nand second line antitubercular agents  . \n\n \n\nSeveral multiple drug resistant tuberculosis ( MDRTB) outbreaks\nhave been characterized by mortality rates of 70-90%.\n\n\nIn many cases, there was rapid progression of the disease from\ndiagnosis to death, with median time of four to six weeks  .\n\n\nBecause of the slow growth rate of the organism, it may take from\nfour to eight weeks for its growth and detection in culture and another three\nto four weeks for its response to drugs to be known using conventional drug\nsusceptibility analyses  .\n\n\nHence, many of the MDRTB patients died before the drug sensitivity\nprofiles were determined  . \n\n \n\nIn addition to the high infectivity of tuberculosis, unrecognized\ndrug resistance increases the risk of transmission both in the community and\nin the hospital while the patients receive ineffective therapy pending the\nresults of drug susceptibility tests  .\n\n\nIn several instances, nosocomial transmission of MDRTB from patients\nto health workers have been documented  .\n\n\nThus, the emergence of drug resistance in the organism, usually to\nmultiple drugs, the highly infectious nature of the disease and the immediate\nthreat to life in some cases, as in patients with TB meningitis, highlight\nthe need for means of rapidly detecting resistant strains. \n\n \n\nMolecular analysis or DNA diagnostic assays have the potential to\nprovide rapid determination of drug resistance  .\n\n\nHowever, the development of rapid and reliable diagnostic tests\nrequires an understanding of the molecular basis of resistance to the\ndifferent drugs in   M. tuberculosis   .\n\n\nTo date, only a few genes have been analyzed in molecular terms for\ndrug resistance of the organism.\n\n\nThese are: the   rpo B   gene for\nrifampicin resistance,   gyr A   gene for\nquinolone resistance,   rsp L   and \n rrs   genes for streptomycin resistance, \n inh A   and   kat G  \ngenes for resistance to isoniazid  . \n\n \n\nThis paper concerns the developments in molecular analytical\nmethods as applied to detect the presence of resistance to rifampicin in\nstrains of   M. tuberculosis   .\n\n\nRifampicin is rapidly bactericidal against   M.\ntuberculosis    .\n\n\nTogether with isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol, and together\nwith isoniazid, it forms part of the initial phase and continuation phase of\ntreatment of short course chemotherapy recommended by WHO in 1995  , respectively.\n\n\nResistance to rifampicin results in a more prolonged treatment for\nthe patient and a poor outcome, if the isolate is also resistant to isoniazid\n .\n\n\nIn addition, rifampicin resistance is a marker of MDRTH  .\n\n\nHence, the importance of its early detection. \n\n \n\nTo facilitate the presentation of results of the different\nstudies, the first part of the paper briefly discusses the working principles\nof the different analytical methods used in the different papers reviewed.\n\n\nThis is followed by the different findings on rifampicin resistance\narrived at by using these methods. \n\n\n  ANALYTICAL METHODS AND THEIR WORKING PRINCIPLES \n\n\n \n\n  Polymerized Chain Reaction ( PCR)   .\n\n\nThe PCR has become an indispensable tool in the genetic analysis of\ndrug resistance in   M. tuberculosis   .\n\n\nThis is basically because of the slow growth rate of the organism\nwhich results in long incubation periods for growth and resistance\ndetermination when conventional methods which require its growth are used.\n\n\nBecause of the sensitivity of the method, it can detect the presence\nand drug susceptibility of uncultured organisms directly from clinical\nsamples  .\n\n\nPCR can be used to selectively amplify target sequences that are\npresent in low abundance in a background of genomic DNA  .\n\n\n \n\nThe PCR amplifies a segment of DNA that is found between two\nregions of known sequences.\n\n\nTwo primers, that consist of oligonucleotides, are used for a series\nof synthetic reactions that are catalysed by a DNA polymerase.\n\n\nThese oligonucleotides are complementary to sequences that lie on\nopposite strands of the template DNA and flank the segment that is to be\namplified  .\n\n\nThus, the choice of primers is very important as these determine the\nDNA segment that will be amplified.\n\n\nThe primers are usually at least 16 nucleotides and preferably 20-24\nnucleotides in length.\n\n\nThe usual span between primers for diagnostic assays is 50 to 1,500\nnucleotide bases  . \n\n \n\nThe reaction mixture consists of the extracted target DNA either\nfrom cultured organisms or from organisms in clinical specimen, dNTPs ( dATP,\ndTTP, dCTP and dGTP), buffer ( Kcl, MgCl, and Tris Cl), the primers and a DNA\npolymerase.\n\n\nCurrently, the most widely used DNA polymerase is the thermostable\n  Taq   polymase purified from the thermophilic\nbacteria,   Thermus aquaticus   .\n\n\nThe reaction is carried out in a programmable thermal cycler which is\ncapable of conducting successive heating and cooling cycles. \n\n \n\nEach cycle of PCR consists of three steps: 1) Denaturing step:\nThe target DNA is incubated at high temperature (  e.g.  ,\n95&degree;C) to allow the target strands to be separated from each other.\n\n\n2) Annealing step: The reaction mixture is cooled (  e.g.\n , 55&degree;C) which allows the primers to anneal to their\ncomplementary target sequence and 3) Extension step: The reaction mixture is\nbrought to a higher temperature intermediate to the denaturation and\nannealing temperatures (  e.g.  , 70&degree;C).\n\n\nThe primers are extended on the DNA template by the DNA polymerase.\n\n\nA typical PCR protocol comprises 30 to 50 of this thermal cycles.\n\n\nTheoretically, there is doubling of the target sequence each time a\ncycle is completed since each of the DNA strands in the mixture now serves as\na template for the succeeding cycle.\n\n\nThus, repeating the thermal cycle results in a geometric accumulation\nof amplified target sequences  . \n\n \n\n  Nucleotide Sequencing  . \n\n\nThe two rapid sequencing techniques used currently are the\ndideoxymediated chain termination method of Sanger,   et al.\n   and the chemical degradation method of\nMaxam and Gilbert  .\n\n\nDifferent principles are used in these methods.\n\n\nThe Sanger technique is the current choice for simple determination\nof DNA sequence because of its ease and rapidity.\n\n\nMost of the current sequencing strategies have been designed for use\nwith this method  .\n\n\nFor the purpose of this paper, only the Sanger technique is\ndescribed. \n\n \n\nThe working principle of the method is as follows  :  \n\n \n\n2'3 'ddNTPs differ from conventional dNTPs in the absence of a\nhydroxyl residue at the 3' position of deoxyribose.\n\n\nThey are incorporated by DNA polymerase into a growing DNA chain\nthrough their 5' triphosphate groups.\n\n\nHowever, formation of a phosphodiester bond with the succeeding dNTP\nis prevented because of the absence of a 3' hydroxyl residue.\n\n\nHence, further extension of the growing DNA chain does not take\nplace.\n\n\nWhen a small amount of one ddNTP is included with the four\nconventional dNTPs ( including radio-labeled dNTPs) in a reaction mixture for\nDNA synthesis, there is competition between extension of the chain and the\ninfrequent, but specific termination.\n\n\nThe products of the reaction with DNA polymerase are a series of\noligonucleotide chains whose lengths are determined by the distance between\nthe terminus of the primer used to initiate DNA synthesis and the site of\npremature termination.\n\n\nFour different ddNTPs in four separate enzymatic reactions are used.\n\n\nPopulations of oligonucleotides are generated that terminate at\npositions occupied by every A, C, T or G in the template strand.\n\n\nAfter denaturation, the radiolabelled oligonuculeotides are separated\nby electrophoresis and visualized after autoradiography. \n\n \n\nAutomatic DNA sequencing uses the same principle but without the\nneed to use radiolabeled dNTPs.\n\n\nThe description that follows was taken from the users manual of the\nApplied Biosystems Model 373 DNA Sequencing System.\n\n\nThe dideoxy-sequencing reactions are performed with fluorescent\ndye-labeled primers.\n\n\nDye labels can be incorporated into DNA using either 5' dye-labeled\nprimers or 3' dye-labeled dideoxynucleotide terminators.\n\n\nFour different fluorescent dyes distinguish the products from each-of\nthe four sequencing reactions.\n\n\nThe dye-labeled DNA fragments electrophorese through an acrylamide\ngel and separate according to size.\n\n\nWhen the fragments reach a fixed position above the lower buffer\nchamber, the fluorescence of the dyes is excited by light from a laser which\nscans back and forth across the area of the gel.\n\n\nA photomultiplier tube detects the fluorescent light and converts it\ninto an electrical signal.\n\n\nThe signals are then transmitted to the computer for eventual\nprocessing. \n\n \n\n  PCR-Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism ( SSCP)\nAssay  . \n\n\nThe method is based on the property of separated strands of DNA to\nadopt a folded conformation as a result of self complementarity and\nintramolecular interactions.\n\n\nThe presence of a single nucleotide mutation usually results in an\naltered conformation that is shown as a change in DNA strand mobility by\nnondenaturing gel electrophoresis  . \n\n \n\nThis method was first developed by Orita,   et al.\n   to detect polymorphisms of human DNA.\n\n\nIn combination with PCR, SSCP has been widely utilized to detect\nmutations in   Mycobacterium   sp. which lead to\ndrug resistance  .\n\n\nThe composition of the sp. reaction mixture is similar to that in the\ntypical PCR reaction except that a portion of the dCTP component is replaced\nby [ alpha-  32  P] dCTP.\n\n\nAfter amplification, the radiolabeled PCR product is denatured to\nsingle strands and loaded into a nondenaturing sequencing-format gel ( called\nmutation detection enhancement MDE gel).\n\n\nAfter electrophoresis, the gel is processed for autoradiography. \n\n \n\nCompared to nucleotide sequencing which is labor intensive and\nrequires strong amplification of the DNA, PCR-SSCP allows processing of a\nlarger number of samples (  e.g.  , 40 samples per gel).\n\n\nIt is being developed for use as a screening procedure for detection\nof mutation to rifampicin resistance in  M. tuberculosis   .\n\n\nThis method is a promising technique for direct detection of mutants\nin clinical samples. \n\n \n\nTelenti   et al.   \non the other hand developed a method for PCR for automated SSCP.\n\n\nIn this method, primers for PCR are 5'-labeled with fiuorescein\nduring the last step of the oligonucleotide synthesis.\n\n\nNo substitution of a portion of the dCTP with radiolabeled dCTP is\nnecessary.\n\n\nThe amplification products are prepared as for the conventional SSCP,\nloaded on the nondenaturing sequencing format gel ( MIDE) which is fitted in\nan automated sequencer and run overnight.\n\n\nTo correct for small variations in total electrophoresis time,\nretention ( detection) times are expressed as relative values by referring\nall results to the detection time of the first strand of the control included\nin each experiment as reference. \n\n \n\n  Nested Amplification   .\n\n\nThis method is a modification of PCR which involves two rounds of\namplification  .\n\n\nThe first round is performed with a single primer pair for 15-30\ncycles.\n\n\nThe products are then amplified in a second round with a second\nprimer pair that is now specific for the internal sequence amplified by the\nfirst primer pair.\n\n\nThe second amplification usually proceeds for an additional 15 to 30\ncycles.\n\n\nThe products are then detected by gel electrophoresis. \n\n \n\nThis method may involve the transfer of reaction products from\nthe first amplification to a new reaction tube for the second round of\namplification ( two-step nested protocol).\n\n\nThis transfer effectively dilutes out inhibitors that might\ninitially be present in the sample such that suboptimal PCR conditions or\ninhibitors are eliminated in the second round of amplification.\n\n\nThis makes nested amplification more sensitive than conventional\nPCR.\n\n\nThe presence of a mutation in the isolate results in the formation\nof heteroduplexes instead of homoduplexes.\n\n\nThe difference is detected after electrophoresis of these duplexes\nin the NME gel  . \n\n\n  RIFAMPICIN RESISTANCE AND ITS DETECTION  \n\n \n\nThe mechanism of action of rifampicin in   M.\ntuberculosis   is believed to involve interference with\ntranscription and RNA elongation by binding of the drug to the B subunit of\nthe plomerase.\n\n\nThe B subunit is coded for by the  rpo B  gene.\n\n\nResistance to rifampicin in   M. tuberculosis\n  has been identified to be mostly due to mutations in this\ngene  .\n\n\nMutations leading to substitution of key amino acids in the B\nsubunit would result in conformation changes and defective binding of the\ndrug.\n\n\nThese changes are responsible for \" one-step &rdquo; high\nlevel resistance in strains not exposed previously to the antibiotic at a\nrate of 10  - 8  to 10  - 7   .", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source":

{"text": "Spawning and Larval development of Tropical Abalone \nHaliotis Asinina  ( Linne)  \n\n\n Emmanuel C. Capinpin \n\n\n  ABSTRACT  \n\n \n\n Dessication, thermal shock, ultaviolet-irradiated seawater,\nhydrogen peroxide, singly or in combination, failed to induce the tropical\nabalone,   Hallotis asinina   to spawn viable\nnumber of eggs or sperm.\n\n\nHowever, natural spontaneous spawnings occurred frequently and\nfertilized eggs with an average size of 180 um were obtained.\n\n\nTrochophore larvae hatched 5.2-5.6 h after fertilization (\n27.2-30.2&degee C).\n\n\nVeliger larvae were observed 8 h after fertilization and achieved\ncreeping ability 30 h after fertilization.\n\n\nCompetent larvae settled within 2-3 d on prepared diatom plates and\njuveniles forming the first respiratory pore were observed after 30 d. \n\n\n\n  INTRODUCTION  \n\n \n\nThe tropical abalone   Haloitis asinina \n Linne ( 1758) is widely distributed in coastal reef zones of Southeast\nAsia ( Fuze, 1981; Nateewathana and Bussarawit, 1988; Singhagraiwan and\nSasaki, 1991a, b) extending up to the subtropical and tropical regions of\nJapan ( Hahn, 1989a).\n\n\nAmong the two common species of abalone reported in the Philippines (\nFuze, 1981),   H. asinina   has the potential for\nartificial propagation due to its large size and body weight.\n\n\nRecent advances in Thailand have confirmed the potential of this\nspecies for seed production and culture ( Singhagraiwan and Sasaki, 1991a,b).\n\n\n \n\nA commercial abalone fishery exists in the Philippines.\n\n\nIn 1991, the Philippines exported to Hongkong, Japan, United States,\nSingapore, Australia, and Guam 283,391 kg of processed abalone worth US\n&dollar; 2,070,503 ( NSO, 1991).\n\n\nAlthough demand for abalone meat remains high, the status of the\nfishery, reproductive biology, and seed production trials of  \nH. asinina   in the Philippines is not known. \n\n \n\nOver the last three decades, several commercially important\nabalone species in several countries have been successfully induced to spawn\nby the use of ultraviolet ( uv) irradiation and hydrogen peroxide ( Hahn,\n1989b).\n\n\nIn Japan and U.S. abalone species are induced to spawn on demand\nthroughout the year by the heavily UV-irradiated seawater technique ( Uki and\nKikuchi, 1984; Ebert and Houk, 1984).\n\n\nHydrogen peroxide may also induce gravid   H. refescens,\nH. coccinea canariensis   , and   H. discus\nhannai   to spawn ( Morse  et al.  1977;\nPe&ntilde;a, 1986; Hahn, 1994).\n\n\nHowever, Singhagraiwan and Sasaki ( 1991a) failed to induce spawning\nin   H. asinina   by uv-irradiated seawater;\nhence, fertilized eggs and larvae were obtained solely from natural spawns.\n\n\n \n\nThis study aimed to develop seed production methods of \n H. asinina   and to describe its larval development.\n\n\nAs successfully carried out in Japan using   H. discus\nhannai   ( Saito, 1984), artificially produced  \nH. asinina   seed may be used to re-stock coastal areas in the\nPhilippines. \n\n\n  MATERIALS AND METHODS  \n\n\n Broodstock Collection and Maintenance \n\n \n\n  H. asinina   broodstock were\ncollected from shallow rocky reefs of Panagatan Cays, Antique, Philippines (\nFig. 1) on January 26 and February 23, 1994.\n\n\nShell length and total weight ranged from 54 to 108 mm and from 34.6\nto 186.8 g, respectively.\n\n\nBroodstock were transported to the Tigbauan Main Station of\nSEAFDEC/AQD. \n\n \n\nForty-five spawners ( 10 males and 35 females) were placed in a\n1-t oval fiberglass tank.\n\n\nWater inlet and aeration system in the tank were similar to that used\nat the Oyster Research Institute in Japan ( Fig. 2).\n\n\nA polyvinyl chloride ( PVC) gutter cut into four 30-cm long sections\n  ad libitum   to the spawners. \n\n\n  Artificial Spawning  \n\n \n\nRipe individuals were selected and placed in separate 9-l\nrectangular plastic containers.\n\n\nGonadal maturity was assessed by gently opening a space between the\nshell and the soft body.\n\n\nMature males have milky white testis while mature females have dark\ngreen ovaries.\n\n\nA gross description of gonad development followed 5 arbitrary stages,\ndepending on the area of the gonad covering the digestive gland.\n\n\nDevelopment varied from immature ( Stage 1) to full maturity ( Stage\n5; Table 1).\n\n\nOnly broodstock with gonads at Stages 4 and 5 were stimulated to\nspawn by dessication ( 1.0-1.5 h), thermal shock ( 14-5.1&degree;C),\nUV-irradiated seawater ( filtered to 5 um; 350-1, 329 mWh/1), hydrogen\nperoxide ( 0.25-1.0 mM), and application of spawned abalone milt ( Table 2).\n\n\n \n\nDessication was carried out by removing individuals from the\nwater and wrapping them in moist sterile gauze for about 1-1.5 h.\n\n\nThermal shock consisted of raising the water temperature above\nambient using a temperature-controlled water heater and then gradually\ndecreasing it to ambient.\n\n\nArtificial induction of spawning using hydrogen peroxide was carried\nout using reagent grade ( 30%) chemical.\n\n\nThe animals were exposed to the hydrogen peroxide solution for 2-3 h.\n\n\nAfter this period, the solution was decanted and the container\nthoroughly rinsed and replaced with clean isothermal seawater.\n\n\nThis was not added when hydrogen peroxide was used because it was not\nrequired for any specific chemical reaction ( Hanh, 1989b).\n\n\nUltraviolet-irradiation was carried out using 2 uv light systems in\nseries ( Toshiba brand; model GWO-1526 PB).\n\n\nThe amount of uv-irradiation was calculated based on the flow rate of\nfiltered seawater entering the uv system.\n\n\nLastly, spawn abalone milt was collected from the broodstock tank\nreleased from natural spawning. \n\n\n  Egg Collection and Larval Rearing  \n\n \n\nFertilized eggs or trochophore larvae from natural spawnings were\ncollected with a special larval trap ( 80 um mesh plankton net) installed at\nthe drain outlet of the broodstock tank ( Fig. 2).\n\n\nCollected eggs or larvae were washed with uv-irradiated seawater and\nthen distributed to 9-1 rectangular plastic containers. \n\n \n\nTrochophore larvae were kept in the same containers until the\nveliger stage.\n\n\nUpon observation of the operculum, eyespot, and fully formed\npropodium, veliger larvae ( Fig. 4e) were transferred to a 1-t settlement\ntank provided with vertically placed corrugated diatom plates.\n\n\nWater flow was than stopped for 2-3 d to allow settlement of viable\nlarvae.\n\n\nAfter settlement, seawater was re-introduced and maintained at a flow\nrate of 550-600 L/h.\n\n\nLarvae fed on the diatoms   Navicula sp. \n and   Nitzschia sp.   that have grown on\nthe plates. \n\n \n\nEmbryonic, larval, and post-larval development stages were\nmonitored.\n\n\nMorphological characteristics were based from Seki and Kan-no (\n1977). \n\n \n\nWater temperature and salinity ranged from 27.7 to 30.2&degree; C\nand from 30 to 32 ppt, respectively. \n\n\n  RESULTS  \n\n\n  Natural Spawnings  \n\n \n\nNatural spawnings occurred several days before or during the new\nmoon and full moon ( Fig. 3).\n\n\nThis trend continued during the initial two months of the experiment\nand spawnings were observed thereafter to occur for several days after at\nleast every two weeks following a lunar cycle. \n\n\n  Artificial Induction of Spawning  \n\n \n\nGravid abalone did not spawn after application of dessication,\nthermal stock, uv irradiation or hydrogen peroxide.\n\n\nHowever, milt released by a single male induced 3 females to spawn\n1.5 h after milt release.\n\n\nSpawned eggs, however, were immature and few ( 8.1 - 16.2 x 10  3\n ) compared to about 261 x 10  3  eggs obtained from a single\nnatural spawning. \n\n \n\nPumping movement which usually occurs at the time of spawning was\nobserved when hydrogen peroxide was used as spawning stimulus.\n\n\nHowever, only seawater was discharged from the respiratory pores.\n\n\n\n  Early development  \n\n \n\nNewly spawned eggs were green and measured 180 um in diameter (\nFig. 4a).\n\n\nCleavage began after discharge of the polar bodies and development\nprogressed to the morula, blastula, and gastrula stages ( Table 3).\n\n\nTrochophore larvae hatched 5.2-5.6 h after fertilization ( Fig. 4c),\nbegan shell secretion, and then transformed to veliger larvae 8 h\npost-fertilization.\n\n\nAt this point, the apical region of the larvae was flat and the velum\ncompletely developed with long cilia present.\n\n\nFigure 4d shows a veliger larva before torsion of foot mass while\nFigure 4e shows a veliger larva after torsion of foot mass with development\nof operculum, eyespot, propodium, and cephalic tentacle.\n\n\nThe veliger larvae acquired creeping ability 30 h after fertilization\n( Fig. 4f) and settled on prepared diatom plates within 2-3 d ( Fig. 4g).\n\n\nAfter 30 d, the first respiratory pore ( notch stage) was observed at\na shell length of 2.1 mm ( Fig. 4h). \n\n\n  DISCUSSION  \n\n\n  Artificial Spawning  \n\n \n\nDessication or complete removal of individuals from the water, in\ncombination with thermal shock or uv light, was not successful in inducing\n  H. asinina   to spawn.\n\n\nDessication alone is unreliable and has no biological significance\nbecause abalone are subtidal and would never be subjected to this kind of\nstimulus in nature, causing even the release of large quantities of immature\ngametes ( Carlisle, 1945; Hahn, 1989b).\n\n\nHowever, dessication in combination with UV-irradiated seawater yield\ngood results in other abalone species ( Uki and Kikuchi, 1984; Chen, 1984;\nHan   et al.   1989). \n\n \n\nThermal shock or raising the water temperature above ambient, in\ncombination with various stimuli, also failed to induce spawning in this\nspecies.\n\n\nThermal shock alone, like dessication, is only occasionally\nsuccessful ( Leighton, 1974).\n\n\nIt causes the release of immature gametes and does not assure the\nsimultaneous release of viable gametes ( Carlisle, 1945; Hahn, 1989b).\n\n\nThis technique, however, was sufficient if used during the breeding\nseason of   H. diversicolor supertexta   ( Chen,\n1984). \n\n \n\nAlthough irradiation of seawater with uv light is a fast and\nreliable method for induction of spawning in several species of abalone ( Uki\nand Kikuchi, 1984; Ebert and Houk, 1984; Chen, 1984; Han   et\nal.   1989; Han, 1989b), it was not effective in inducing \n H. asinina   in this experiment to spawn when either\nsingly or in combination with other stimuli.\n\n\nSinghagraiwan and Sasaki ( 1991a) also were unable to spawn \n H. asinina   using uv-irradiated seawater.\n\n\nSpawning failure in this experiment may have been caused by the\nhigher intensity of radiation ( including ultraviolet) available in the lower\nlatitude due to unequal distribution of solar radiation on the earth 's\nsurface.\n\n\nTropical abalone species are already exposed to higher amount of uv\nlight than temperate species.\n\n\nDifficulty in assessing fully matured and spawnable individuals by\nvisual inspection and the occurrence of frequent natural spawnings are also\nother factors to be considered. \n\n \n\nInduced spawning of   H. asinina  \ncan be achieved when spawned milt is used to induce gravid females.\n\n\nSimilar results were reported by Singhagraiwan and Doi ( 1992).\n\n\nAdding newly-spawned gametes from either sex into the water can\ntrigger responsive spawning among conspecifics ( Carlisle, 1945; Morse\n  et al.   1977; Singhagraiwan and Doi, 1992).\n\n\n\n  Natural spawning  \n\n \n\nNatural spontaneous spawnings are frequently observed to occur in\nthe present study. \n\n \n\nIt was noted that   H. asinina  \nspawns in tanks all year round with a monthly peak in October ( Singhagraiwan\nand Doi, 1992).\n\n\nThe same authors also reported partial and multiple spawning of ripe\nfemales. \n\n \n\n  H. varia   , another tropical\nspecies, also spawns the whole year round as observed in aquaria ( Fuze,\n1981) and based on observations of gonads from a natural population (\nBussarawit   et al.   1990). \n\n\n  Early development  \n\n \n\nEmbryonic and larval development in   H. asinina\n  are a function of water temperature and time since abalone\nlarvae do not feed before settlement ( Hahn, 1989c).\n\n\nThe length of the larval period is about 28.5 h ( 27. 7 - 30.2\n&degree;C) which is considerably shorter than that for   H.\nrufescens   with 6 d at 15 &degree C ( Ebert and Houk, 1984).\n\n\nSettlement, metamorphosis, and deposition of peristomal shell mark\nthe transition from larval to post-larval development until formation of the\nfirst respiratory pore ( Hahn, 1989c).\n\n\nSettlement stage was achieved in   H. asinina\n  after 30 h compared to 188 h for   H. midae\n  at 20&degree; C ( Genade   et al. \n 1988).\n\n\nTable 4 shows the age and shell length of   H. asinina\n  at formation of first respiratory pore compared with other\nabalone species. \n\n \n\nOur results support the strong potential of   H.\nasinina   as an aquaculture species.\n\n\nHowever, further studies are required to develop conditioning\ntechniques for captive broodstock ( e. g. proper nutrition, appropriate sex\nratio, water temperature, water quality, etc.) to allow year round and\nefficient production of abalone larvae and juveniles. \n\n\n  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT  \n\n \n\nThis study was conducted with financial support given by\nSEAFDEC/AQD and JICA.\n\n\nWe thank Ms. Corazon Espegadera for the preparation;

{"text": "Influenza as Zoonosis: an Overview  \n\n\n Celestina G. Robles \n\n\n  ABSTRACT  \n\n \n\n Influenza is endemic in the Philippines occasionally flaring\nup in sharp periodic outbreaks.\n\n\nThe National Intelligence Health Service of the Philippine Health\nDepartment has consistently listed it as one of the top three leading causes\nof morbidity among Filipinos.\n\n\nPandemic influenza is attributed to the ability of the influenza A\nvirus to undergo antigenic drift and antigenic shift resulting in new\nsubtypes which escape the neutralizing effect of antibodies induced by\nprevious infections or vaccination.\n\n\nGenetic reassortment and recombination between human and animal\ninfluenza viruses have also given rise to new subtypes.\n\n\nSurveillance among human and animal populations to monitor currently\ncirculating strains and to detect emerging variants is therefore important in\ndetermining correct control measures including the appropriate composition of\ninfluenza vaccines to be produced for the current season.\n\n\nExtensive serological studies are needed to determine the ecology of\nhuman and animal influenza viruses in the Philippines, and phylogenetic\nstudies of more recent isolates may help trace the evolution of some local\nstrains.\n\n\nA review of literature showed the lack of current information on\ninfluenza in the Philippines and this all the more emphasizes the need to\nconduct new researches on the virus and its epidemiology in the local\nsetting.  \n\n\n  History and epidemiology  \n\n \n\nInfluenza has been responsible for pandemics, epidemics,\nlocalized outbreaks as well as sporadic cases resulting in excess deaths and\nsubstantial mobidity. \n\n\nEpidemics that were probably influenza have been reported throughout\nrecorded history.\n\n\nAs early as 1170 and 1500 in England, mention has already been made\nin the medical literature of epidemics of a disease similar to influenza.\n\n\nBut it was only in 1510 that a more authentic epidemic has been\ndescribed.\n\n\nSince then up to the 19th century, 11 influenza pandemics ( those of\n1510, 1559, 1580, 1593, 1729, 1788, 1830, 1833, 1836, 1847, and 1889) have\nbeen documented. \n\n\nIn the 20th century there have already been 4 pandemics ( 1918/19,\n1957/58, 1968/69 and 1977).\n\n\nThe great pandemic of 1918/19 caused an estimated 20 million deaths.\n\n\nBetween pandemics usually there have been epidemics of varying\nseverity at intervals of one to three years and a trickle of sporadic cases\nevery winter. \n\n\nIn the United States during the 1954 epidemic, 70,000 deaths were\nattributed to the Asian strain circulating at the time.\n\n\nBetween 1957 to 1986 the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC) in\nAtlanta, Georgia, documented more than 10,000 excess deaths in each of the 19\nepidemics in the USA, with more than 40,000 deaths in several of them. \n\n \n\nIn the Philippines the first recorded influenza outbreak occurred\nin 1918 in Manila and nearby provinces ( Bataan, Bulacan, Batangas, Rizal,\nLaguna, Tayabas ( now Quezon), Pampanga, and Nueva Ecija).\n\n\nThe period of April to July of that year saw a high morbidity rate\nbut only slight mortality of the affected populations.\n\n\nHowever, in the second phase of the epidemic ( October to December),\nmortality was established at 2.5 to 3% ( 71 243 deaths) in the provinces.\n\n\nIn Manila there was an average of 843 cases per day at the height of\nthe epidemic, and there were 3.85 deaths per 1000 population.\n\n\nIn 1957, heightened influenza activity was again observed starting in\nApril, peaking in May, and finally subsiding in June.\n\n\nDuring the period of the epidemic, 10,306 cases were reported with\n216 deaths.\n\n\n Complement-fixation test and\nhemagglutination-inhibition test results of specimens taken from clinically\ndiagnosed influenza patients at that time were highly suggestive of a type A\n( A/PR8/34 and A/FMI/47) influenza infection. \n\n\nA similar serological evaluation of specimens collected during a\nreported 1960-61 outbreak in Manila also showed 11 of 35 paired samples\nhaving a significant antibody titre rise against A/Phil/57. \n\n\nIsolation of the A/Victoria/3/75 strain of influenza virus and\nserological testing of unpaired sera documented the influenza outbreak during\nJune to August of 1975. \n\n\n  Antigenic drift and antigenic shift  \n\n \n\nAlthough the last severe pandemic was over 20 years ago,\ninfluenza remains an important viral epidemic disease because of its\npotential to return to its former magnitude. \n\n\nA major concern is the rapidity with which epidemics evolve because\nof the influenza A virus ' ability to undergo antigenic shift and antigenic\ndrift resulting in new strains.\n\n\nInfluenza virus B mutates at a much lesser degree. \n\n\nEmergence of new subtypes and their introduction to a nonimmune\npopulation results in universal susceptibility. \n\n\nIt has therefore become imperative to establish an extensive\nsurveillance system for influenza.\n\n\nThe World Health Organization ( WHO) Influenza Surveillance Programme\nhas long been a model of international collaboration and rapid exchange of\ninformation as will be discussed later.\n\n\nInfluenza surveillance not only provides an assessment of the real\nimpact of outbreaks but also enables the identification of currently\ncirculating variants.\n\n\nThis is especially important since new variants with different\nantigenic determinants can escape the neutralizing antibodies that were\ndeveloped through previous vaccinations or infections.\n\n\nThus, in vaccine production, some strains are changed every one or\ntwo years. \n\n \n\nThe influenza virus is classified under Family \nOrthomyxoviridae  , Genus Influenzavirus with Species\nInfluenzavirus A and Influenzavirus B, and probable Genus Influenzavirus C\nwith Species Influenzavirus C.\n\n\nIt is a pleomorphic or filamentous virion with a diameter of 80 to\n120 nm.\n\n\nFrom the exterior surface of the lipid envelope project the\nrod-shaped  hemagglutinin  ( H) and the mushroom-shaped \nneuraminidase  ( N) peplomers, both of which carry the subtype-specific\nantigenic determinants.\n\n\nThe genome occurs as 8 separate molecules and reassortment of the\ngenes in the 8 RNA segments for hemagglutinin and neuraminidase gives rise to\n antigenic shift  .\n\n\nIn antigenic shift there is a change of the epidemic strain to a\nvirus having hemagglutinin of a subtype different from previously prevalent\nstrains. \n\n\nThe emergence of completely new subtypes due to this antigenic shift,\nand which appear at irregular intervals, are responsible for the pandemics.\n\n\n \n\nMore gradual antigenic variations or mutations within each\nsubtype is known as antigenic drift. \n\n\nThese continuous minor antigenic changes in the strains are\nresponsible for interpandemic epidemics. \n\n\nResults of sub-typing influenza A viruses by immunodiffusion has\nindicated the presence of 12 hemagglutinin subtypes ( designated as H1 to\nH12) and 9 neuraminidase subtypes ( N1 to N9) as based on the 1980 system.\n\n\n\nHowever, Ghendon describes 13 H subtypes identified in man and\nseveral animal species. \n\n\nInfluenza A viruses are responsible for widespread epidemics while\nthe influenza B viruses, which are not differentiated into subtypes, are\nresponsible mainly for localized outbreaks and the resulting mortality is not\nquite as high as with the A viruses.\n\n\nInfluenza C viruses are also not differentiated into subtypes and are\nrarely isolated from epidemics or outbreaks.\n\n\nBased on serosurveys C viruses are known to infect the majority of\npersons during childhood causing a mild illness resembling the common cold.\n\n\n\nOnly influenza A viruses are known to infect species other than man\nand are responsible for epizootics of swine influenza, equine influenza, and\navian influenza ( also called fowl plague). \n\n \n\nTheoretically, any combination of H and N is possible but only\nlimited ranges of subtypes have actually been found in each species of\nanimal. \n\n\nFor human influenza viruses, a large number of antigenically\ndistinguishable strains have been identified for the H1, H2, H3, and N1 and\nN2 subtypes.\n\n\nNomenclature of influenza virus strains include: ( 1) the letter A,\nB, or C ( to describe the virus species), ( 2) the animal species ( except\nfor isolates from man), ( 3) the geographic location of the isolation, ( 4) a\nserial number, and ( 5) for influenza A virus, the subtype of hemagglutinin\nand neuraminidase are added in parenthesis.\n\n\nFinal comparison of the relationship of isolates to reference strains\nwithin each subtype ( A) or within each type ( B and C) is done by HI and NI\nusing highly specific sera from animals.\n\n\nSome examples of reference strains are : A/Singapore/6/86 ( H1N1),\nA/Singapore/1/57 ( H2N2), A/Port Chalmers/1/77 ( H3N2), B/Panama/45/90, C/Ann\nArbor/1/50, A/swine/New Jersey/8/76 ( H1N1), and A/equine2/Berlin/5/89 (\nH3N8).  \n\n \n\nThe clinical manifestation of the disease in man is similar\nwhether it is caused by the influenzavirus A, B or C.\n\n\nSerological tests are needed to establish etiologic diagnosis.\n\n\nHowever, influenza A viruses have been implicated in widespread\nepidemics with excess mortality, the B viruses with localized outbreaks and\nwith mortality not quite as high as with the A viruses, and the C virus is\nrarely isolated from epidemics and outbreaks but is known to infect the\nmajority of persons during childhood causing a mild illness resembling the\ncommon cold. \n\n\nInfluenza in man is characterized by fever, chilliness, headache,\nmyalgia, prostration, coryza and mild sore throat.\n\n\nCough is severe and protracted.\n\n\nIt is usually limited and recovery can be expected in 2 to 7 days.\n\n\nDeath is usually due to pneumonia and/or the exacerbation of\ncardiopulmonary and other conditions.  \n\n \n\nVirological surveillance reveals that analogues of\nA/Philippines/2/82 ( H3N2) were isolated from different parts of the world (\nsuch as Finland, Czechoslovakia, USSR ( Leningrad), USA ( New York), and\nPapua New Guinea) including the Philippines during the period 1980 to 1985.\n\n\n\nThe biological activities of this variant ( or its recombinant\nforms), as demonstrated by   in vitro   studies,\nmay indicate a rather high level of pathogenicity. \n\n\nA case of a pregnant woman who died from pneumonia caused by\ninfluenza ( A/Philippines/2/82) has been reported. \n\n\nThe influenza ( A/Philippines/2/82) strain was incorporated in the\n1984-1985 human and animal influenza vaccine formulations and was determined\nto elicit satisfactory antibody response with minimal side effects.  \n\n \n\nFigure 1 illustrates the theory of the \" recycling &rdquo;\nof the human influenza A virus whereby the three subtypes H1N1, H2N2, and\nH3N2, seem to emerge in succession in more or less periodic intervals. \n\n\n  A unique zoonosis  \n\n \n\nBy definition a zoonosis is a disease that is transmissible from\nanimals to man and  vice versa  .\n\n\nThe influenza A virus does not simply directly infect man and\nanimals; most pandemic strains or new subtypes have been found to emerge from\ngenetic reassortment between subtypes in animal hosts and human viruses.\n\n\nPhylogenetic studies have demonstrated that aquatic birds are the\nprimordial source of all influenza viruses in other species, and that pigs\nserve as intermediate hosts in the genetic exchange between influenza viruses\nin avian and human species.  \n\n \n\nThe earliest known influenza viruses were those of the fowl\nplague viruses but their relationship to human influenza virus was not yet\nknown at the time.\n\n\nAntigenic analysis of many isolates of animal influenza viruses have\nshown that among avian isolates, H and N antigens exist that cross-react with\neach of the subtypes found for human influenza viruses, e. g. A/Hong\nKong/1/68 ( H3N2) reacting with A/duck/Germany/1215 ( H3N2), or\nA/Japan/305/57 ( H2N2) reacting with A/turkey/Mass/3740/65 ( H6N2). \n\n\nAvian influenza is worldwide and reported outbreaks had occurred in\nchickens, turkeys, ducks, pheasants, quails, pigeons, geese and various wild\nspecies.\n\n\nAll 13 H subtypes and all 9 N subtypes of the virus have been\nisolated in all species of birds. \n\n\nSubstantial economic losses are incurred during an epizootic in a\ncommercial farm due to high mortality rate, drastic drop in egg production,\nand costs of control measures including depopulation.\n\n\nFor example, the Pennsylvania and Virginia epidemics of 1983-84,\ncaused by subtype H5N2, resulted in the slaughter of over 17 million birds\ncosting approximately 40 million US dollars in indemnity. \n\n\nMixed infections of birds with several subtypes may occur, leading to\nrecombination. \n\n\nAvian influenza is characterized mainly by respiratory signs but the\ndisease signs range from only a slight decrease in egg production or\nfertility to a high fatal fulminating infection.\n\n\nIn severely affected hosts, cyanosis and edema of the head, comb and\nwattle with blood-stained oral and nasal discharges are common.\n\n\nSinusitis is not uncommon in ducks, quail and turkeys.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "26f04331-ffb2-4bac-821f-9c4bce6ff53f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.197527+00:00"}
{"text": "Conjugative Transferability of the Antibiotic Resistance in\nFecal Isolates of   Escherichia Coli   from the\nSan Lazaro Hospital  \n\n\n Julieta C. Zabal \n\n\n  ABSTRACT  \n\n \n\n Thirty-one   Escherichia coli  \nisolates obtained from rectal swab samples of the San Lazaro Hospital,\nshowing resistance to SXT-TMP and C were made to conjugate with \n E. coli   SF 800 and   Salmonella\n  C 568 as recipients.\n\n\nAll of the donor isolates transferred their resistance to  E. coli\n SF 800.\n\n\nWith  Salmonella  C 568 as recipient however, only\n16 out of 31 ( 51.61%) effected transfer of drug resistance.\n\n\nIn both conjugation pairs complete transfer was demonstrated.\n\n\nThe resistance marker from the donor isolates were transferred at a\nfrequency of 3.35 x 10-3 to 3 39 x 10-1 to the recipient  \nSalmonella   C 568.\n\n\nThe multiplicity of drug resistance, their conjugative transferability\ncoupled with high frequency of transfer showed the occurrence of\nplasmid-borne drug resistance in these   E. coli \n isolates.  \n\n\n  INTRODUCTION  \n\n \n\nThe therapeutic value offered by antibiotic against bacterial\ninfections is very much appreciated in the field of human and veterinary\nmedicines...not until reports on the emergence and dissemination of multiple\nantibiotic resistance, have captured much attention among health workers.\n\n\n \n\nResults of several studies correlate the incidence of drug\nresistance to the so-called selective pressure; such that prolonged exposure\nto the drugs would inevitably lead to the development of resistance, with\nresulting decrement in the therapeutic potential of the said drugs.\n\n\nBecause of this, clinicians are now facing a dilemma on the\nprescription of suitable antibiotics in the management of microbial diseases.\n\n\n \n\nResistance to multiple drugs is attributed to the resistance ( R)\nplasmid, an extrachromosomal DNA which is transmissible to other bacterial\ncell via a process called conjugation ( Willets, 1988).\n\n\nIt is believed to be the mechanism which contributes to the acclaimed\nglobal distribution of the resistance problem, among the bacterial milieu (\nGrubb, 1990).\n\n\nUntil now, plasmid-mediated resistance continues to be a scourge in\nmany hospital institutions and remains a major problem in the successful\ntreatment and control of infections.\n\n\nThis study was therefore made to test for the conjugative\ntransferability of antibiotic resistance in fecal isolates of  \nE. coli   from the San Lazaro Hospital. \n\n\n  MATERIALS AND METHODS  \n\n\n  ISOLATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF TEST BACTERIA  \nFifty eight ( 58) isolates of   Escherichia coli \n taken from rectal swabs of patients of the San Lazaro Hospital from\nOctober, 1992 to January, 1993 were used as test microorganisms.\n\n\nThe identity and purity of the bacterial isolates were checked by\nplating them on McConkey agar and Eosin Methylene Blue ( EMB) agar. \n E.coli   - like lactose-fermenting colonies were\nfurther subjected to biochemical tests such as indole and ciltrate.\n\n\nThis was to distinguish   E. coli   from\nother lactose fermenters.\n\n\nThose confirmed to be   E. coli   were\ninoculated onto nutrient agar slants and grown for 18-24 hours at 37 C.\n\n\nThe cultures were stored at 4 C for further studies. \n\n\n  ANTIBIOGRAM TESTING OF BACTERIAL ISOLATES  \n\n \n\nThe antibiotic susceptibilities of the isolates were determined\nby adopting the modified-disk agar diffusion method of Kirby Bauer.\n\n\nFrom the stock culture, a loopful of organisms was inoculated in\nbrain heart infusion broth ( BHIB) and grown at 37C for 18-24 hours.\n\n\nThis was subcultured onto BHIB at 37 C for four hours to bring the\norganisms to their log phase.\n\n\nThe growth was adjusted to the turbidity of McFarland standard number\none to approximate 3 x 10  8  cells/ml of culture.\n\n\nA sterile cotton swab was immersed onto standardized four-hour broth\nculture and streaked onto the surface of Mueller Hinton II agar using an\noverlap method of streaking.\n\n\nDisks impregnated with known amounts of drugs were placed onto the\nsurface of the inoculated plate using a pair of flame-sterilized forceps.\n\n\nThese were: netilmicin ( 30 mcg), amikacin ( 30 mcg),\nsulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim ( 25 mcg), chloramphenicol ( 30 mcg) and\nnalidixic ( 30 mcg).\n\n\nPlates were incubated for 18-24 hours at 37 C after which the\ndiameters of the zones of inhibition in millimeters ( mm) were taken.\n\n\nThe results were interpreted according to the Zone Diameter\nInterpretative Standards prepared by the National Committee for Clinical\nLaboratory Standards ( April, 1990). \n\n\n  CONJUGATION EXPERIMENTS  \n\n\n  Donor Bacteria  \n\n \n\nOf the 58 test isolates identified as   E. coli\n  from rectal swab specimens, 31 were used as donors in the\nconjugation experiment with   E. coli   SF 800\nand with   Salmonella   C 568.\n\n\nThe donors were chosen based on their resistance to at least two of\nthe four drugs e. g. sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim ( 25 mcg);\nchloramphenicol ( 30 mcg) and susceptibility to nalidixic acid ( 30 mcg).\n\n\n\n  Recipient Bacteria  \n\n \n\n  E. coli   SF 800 ( res. nalidixic\nacid resistant) and   Salmonella   C 568 were\nused as recipient strains.\n\n\nThe genotype of   Salmonella   C 568 is\nnot well known.\n\n\nIt was a wild strain isolated by the San Lazaro Hospital from stool\nspecimen.\n\n\nRecipient bacteria were shown to be sensitive in the four test drugs\n( chloramphenicol-30 mcg; sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim-25 mcg;\nnetilmicin-30 mcg; amikacin-30 mcg). \n\n\n  Conjugation Procedure  \n\n \n\nCultures of donor and recipient bacteria were grown separately in\nBHIB at 37 C for 18-24 hours.\n\n\nThese were subcultured for another four hours at 37 C to ensure\nactively-growing bacteria for the mating experiment.\n\n\nThe turbidity of broth culture was standardized to that of McFarland\nnumber one.\n\n\nFifty microliters ( uL) of donor bacteria were mixed with 200 uL of\nrecipient organisms in brain heart infusion agar ( BHIB) plate.\n\n\nUsing a sterile bent glass rod, the mixture of donor and recipient\nwere spread out on the surface of the agar.\n\n\nThese were incubated at 37 C for eight hours undisturbed to effect\nconjugation.\n\n\nThe confluent growth were harvested following the addition of 1.5 ml\nsterile NSS. \n\n\n  Conjugation Between Multiple-Drug Resistant  \nE. coli   and   E. coli   SF 800\n \n\n \n\nThis study made use of a recipient strain lacking the restriction\n( res) enzyme such as the   E. coli   SF 800.\n\n\nThis was to facilitate the acquisition and integration of the\nresistance markers from the donor bacteria.\n\n\nThis in turn helped in establishing the conjugative nature of the\nresistance carried by the donor isolates. \n\n \n\nOne hundred microliters of the bacterial emulsion of conjugative\nmixture were plated onto the BHIA plate containing nalidixic acid plus\nsulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim ( 25 mcg/ml).\n\n\nColonies obtained after incubation at 37 C for 18-24 hours were\nsubcultured and re-examined for their antibiotic sensitivity patterns using\nthe disk agar diffusion method.\n\n\nThis was to check the acquired resistance to the test drugs.\n\n\nIdentification of the transconjugants was based on their resistance\nto nalidixic acid and to chloramphenicol or sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim or\nto both chloramphenicol and sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim. \n\n \n\nControls were run simultaneously to ensure the efficacy of the\nprepared antibiotic plates and the check drug resistance of the donor and\nrecipient.\n\n\nControls were prepared by inoculating each of the donor and recipient\nbacteria on plates containing nalidixic acid ( 30 mcg/ml) with\nchloramphenicol ( 30 mcg/ml) and nalidixic acid with\nsulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim ( 25 mcg/ml).\n\n\nSimilarly, conjugation mixture, donor and recipient bacteria were\nplated separately on each of the following drugs: nalidixic acid ( 30 mcg/ml)\nsulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim ( 25 mcg/ml) and chloramphenicol ( 30 mcg/ml).\n\n\n\n  Conjugation Between Multiple-Drug Resistant  \nE. coli   and   Salmonella   C 568\n \n\n \n\nAll of the 31   E. coli   donors\nwhich tested positive for the conjugative transfer of their drug resistance\nwere further made to conjugate with   Salmonella \n C 568. \n\n \n\nIn this procedure, the donor, recipient and transconjugant were\nidentified based on their ability to ferment lactose using McConkey as the\nplate medium and the resistance to the test drugs.\n\n\nThe failure to find    Salmonella \n  strain sensitive to the four test drugs but resistant to\nnalidixic acid made the researcher resort to lactose fermentation as the\nmarker in the selection of transconjugants. \n\n \n\nFrom the bacterial suspension of the conjugation mixture, 100 uL\nwere plated on McConkey agar plate with the drug to which the donor was\nresistant (  e.g.  McConkey with chloramphenicol [ 30\nmcg/ml] and McConkey with sulphamethoxazole-trimethprim [ 25 mcg/ml]).\n\n\nLikewise, the same quantity of the donor and recipient bacteria were\nplated separately on the selective plate.\n\n\nThe choice of transconjugants was based on the failure to ferment the\nlactose incorporated in the McConkey agar, hence yielding colorless colonies.\n\n\nOn the other hand, donor isolates were able to ferment lactose, thus\nproducing pink colonies on McConkey agar with chloramphenicol.\n\n\n  Salmonella   C 568 which did not\nreceive the resistance genes, in contrast, failed to grow on the selective\nplate. \n\n\n  Estimation of Conjugative Frequency  \n\n \n\nThe frequency of conjugative transfer of drug resistance from the\n  E. coli   isolates to   Salmonella\n  C 568 was determined.\n\n\nTen-fold serial dilution were made from the conjugation mixture (\ncomposed of donor recipient and transconjugant population).\n\n\nOne hundred microliters ( uL) of each dilution were plated onto each\nof the three McConkey agar plates with the drugs to which the recipient was\nconverted to resistance ( e.g. chloramphenicol [ 30 mcg/ml] or\nsulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim [ 25 mcg/ml]).\n\n\nThis allowed estimation of the number of transconjugant population (\nrecipient which has acquired the resistance factor). \n\n \n\nIn the same manner, 100 uL of the conjugation mixture were plated\nonto each of the three McConkey agar without any drugs.\n\n\nThis permitted growth of donor   E. coli \n ( pink colonies) and the   Salmonella  \nrecipient population ( colorless colonies which received and which did not\nreceive the resistance factor). \n\n \n\nConjugation frequency was taken as the ratio of the number of\ncolony-forming units of transconjugant to the number of colony-forming units\nof recipient population. \n\n\n  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  \n\n \n\nResults of the antibiotic susceptibility tests show that out of\nthe 58   E. coli   isolates examined, 36 (\n62.07%) were resistant to at least one of the five test drugs.\n\n\nFigure 1 shows the resistance phenotypes of the isolates categorized\ninto four groups in terms of their response patterns against the test drugs.\n\n\nThe biggest group composing of   E. coli \n isolates resistant to both C and SXT - TMP ( 53.45%).\n\n\nThis is followed by isolates showing susceptibility to all of the\ntest drugs ( 37.9%).\n\n\nAnother group showed resistance to C only ( 6.9%) and only ( 1.7%) of\nthe isolates showed resistance to SXT-TMP. \n\n \n\nFig. 2 shows that among the five drugs tested, the highest\npercentage resistance was to C ( 35 out of 58 or 60.34%), followed by SXT-TMP\n( 32 out of 58 or 55.17%).\n\n\nThis level of resistance may be due to the rampant use of these two\ndrugs, in the household and hospital.\n\n\nMedical records of the patient from whom the microorganisms were\nisolated revealed that most of them were exposed to the said drugs either by\nself-medication or as prescribed by their doctors.\n\n\nPractices which underscore the vital role played by the selective\npressure on the rise of the resistant microorganisms. \n\n \n\nOf the 58   E. coli   isolates, none\nwere shown to be resistant to NET, AK or NA, results which were similar to\nthose resorted by Hryniewiez  et al.  ( 1993). \n\n \n\nFig. 3 illustrates the results of the conjugation experiments\nbetween the two mating partners:  E. coli  to   E. coli\n  SF 800 and   E. coli   to \n Salmonella   C 568.\n\n\nIn terms of the percentage of donor isolates that effect transfer of\ndrug resistance, this study showed that conjugative transferability is higher\nin mating partners involving same species as in the case of   E.\ncoli   to   E. coli   SF 800 (\nFig. 3a) than in pairs of different genera such as   E. coli\n  and   Salmonella   C 568 ( Fig.\n3b).\n\n\nThese results are similar to those reported by Arnold ( 1986) and\nLevine ( 1973).\n\n\nAll of the 31   E. coli   donor isolates\ntransferred their drug resistance to   E. coli  \nSF 800.\n\n\nResult obtained in this study is significantly higher than to those\nobserved by similar study made by Zaldivar ( 1991) and Sta. Ana ( 1989). \n\n \n\nHowever, in conjugation pair involving   E. coli\n  and   Salmonella   C 568,\ntransfer of drug resistance was seen in 16 out of 31 isolates tested.\n\n\nAs shown in this study, the multiple drug resistance genes harbored\nby the  E. coli  isolates were conjugative, that is, it can be\npassed on to other species which cohabit the same site such as  \nE. coli   which constitutes a great part of the gut flora; and\nmore seriously to a pathogen such as   Salmonella \n C 568.\n\n\nFollowing successful conjugative transfer, this will convert a\npreviously drug sensitive strain to resistance with this acting\nsimultaneously as reservoir and as potential donor of the resistance genes to\nother organisms.\n\n\nThe implication is more serious in case of   Salmonella\n  converted to resistance since this will make treatment of\nsalmonellosis or enteric fever more difficult. \n\n \n\nFifteen of the   E. coli   isolates\ndid not transfer any resistance to   Salmonella  \nC 568. Whether   Salmonella   C 568 is restricted\nminus or not, is not well known.\n\n\nIt is possible that resistance factor was not modified by the\nrecipient cell to prevent its degradation by restriction enzymes in the\nrecipient.\n\n\nModification is accomplished by the methylation of specific DNA\nsequence ( Taylor, 1981).\n\n\nThe ability of the recipient bacterium to accept or integrate\nforeign DNA such as in conjugative gene transfer, is therefore, controlled by\nthe restriction and modification system ( Zubay, 1987).\n\n\nThis is a way of protecting the cell against invading DNA of other\ncell.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "819be951-8355-4ea7-9275-6ee24a6f52b1", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.198491+00:00"}
{"text": "Predatory Feeding in Three Co-occurring Mysids ( Crustacea,\nMysidacea): Functional Responses to Different Prey Types  \n\n\n Ephrime B. Metillo \n\n\n  Abstract  \n\n \n\n\nThe functional responses of three co-existing nearshore mysid shrimps\nwere analyzed using two branchiopodan and one copepodan prey types.\n\n\n  Paramesopodopsis rufa   was the most\nefficient predator of the euryhaline daphniid prey,  \nDaphniopsis australis   .\n\n\nIt showed a steeper linear functional responses curve for this prey\nthan the other two species,   Tenagomysis tasmaniae Anisomysis\nmixta australis   , which showed similar flat linear curves.\n\n\nAll three species exhibited similar predation success on \n Artemia  sp. nauplii  , and similar predation failure\nfor the calanoid copepod   Gladioferens pectinatus \n .\n\n\nThe study provides evidence that differences in predatory feeding\nbehaviour support feeding niche segregation which in turn explains the\nco-occurrence of the three mysid species.  \n\n\n  Introduction  \n\n \n\nPredatory feeding behaviour in many zooplanktonic species of both\nfreshwater and marine habitats is a complex system which requires a more\ndetailed study to elucidate its intricacies ( Kerfoot, 1980; Price, 1988;\nOhman, 1988; Gliwicz & Pijanowska, 1989).\n\n\nThese reviews noted that success of predatory species, as those\nequivalent systems in the terrestrial environment, is influenced by several\nfactors.\n\n\nThere seems to be an optimum prey size in which a predator of a\ncertain size may be efficient.\n\n\nHowever, other factors such as body pigmentation, shape,\npalatability, motion and escape manoeuvres have been also known to determine\nvulnerability of prey to various zooplanktonic predators ( Ohman, 1988;\nGliwicz & Pijanowska, 1989). \n\n \n\nPredatory feeding of both freshwater and marine species of mysids\ninclude a variety of animal prey types ( Mauchline, 1980; Morgan, 1982).\n\n\nThe well studied freshwater species,   Mysis relicta\n  has been known to feed mainly on cladocerans, daphniids\nprimarily ( Lasenby   et al.   1986); although it\ncan also prey upon diaptomid calanoid copepods ( Cooper & Goldman, 1980).\n\n\nOther freshwater species,  e.g  .  \nNeomysis mercedis   ( Murtaugh a,b 1981),   N.\nintermedia   ( Hanazato, 1990),  N. integer  ( Bremer\nand Vijverberg, 1982), and   Mysis mixta   (\nHansson  et al.  , 1990) also prefer daphniid prey.\n\n\nSpecies that are found in the estuarine and/or marine habitats, on\nthe other hand, have been reported to consume benthic harpacticoid copepods (\n  N. integer   , Mauchline, 1971), and calanoid\ncopepods (   N. integer   , Siegfried and\nKopache, 1980;   N. americana   ,  \nMysidopsis bigelowi   , Fulton, 1982;   M.\ngibbosa, M. didelphys, M. angusta   , Mauchline 1970).\n\n\n  Artemia sp. nauplii   have also been\nused as food to various mysid species, e. g.   Metamysidopsis\nelongata   , Clutter and Theilacker, 1971;  \nMysidopsis almyra   , Reitsema and Neff, 1980;  \nAnisomysis sp.   , Mullin and Roman 1986). \n\n \n\nThese zooplanktonic prey species vary in escape behaviour, size,\npigmentation, swimming behaviour and other behavioural characteristics, and\nhence, their vulnerability to mysid predation.\n\n\nDifferent mysid species vary in size and overall predatory feeding\nbehaviour which are also highly likely to influence rates of predation on the\nvarious prey types.\n\n\nThe present study examines the effect of various prey types, sizes\nand behavioural repertoires ( swimming behaviour and escape response) on the\nfunction responses of the three coexisting mysids species,  \nParamesopodopsis rufa   Fenton,   Tenagomysis\ntasmaniae   Fenton, and   Anisomysis mixta\naustralis   Zimmer, in neritic waters off Tasmania. \n\n\n  Materials and Methods  \n\n\n  Experimental Animals  \n\n \n\nField collection and maintenance in the laboratory of mysids and\nthe daphniid prey,   Daphniopsis australis   ,\nare described in detail by Metillo and Ritz ( 1993).\n\n\n\n \n\nMature cysts of   Artemia   sp. (\nArtemia Revolution, New Technology Kent, England) were hatched in the\nlaboratory at 24 &degree; C water temperature and 400/oo salinity.\n\n\nTwo day old metanauplii were used in the predation experiments. \n\n \n\nAdult   Gladioferens pectinatus  \nwere collected from six locations in the Derwent Estuary at a depth of either\n1 m or 20 m using a 300 m mesh conical net.\n\n\nIn the laboratory, these animals were kept in 50-litre plastic tubs\ncontaining seawater from the sampling area.\n\n\nAt the time of collection, a large bloom of  \nCoscinodiscus wailesii   occurred.\n\n\nBuckets of these diatoms were collected and placed into the copepod\ntubs to serve as food.\n\n\nDuring the entire period of the experiment, the tubs with food and\ncopepods were gently aerated, and kept at ambient temperature ( 15&dgree; C),\nand at constant ambient salinity of 340/oo. \n\n \n\nAll feeding experiments were performed simultaneously with each\nof the three mysid species held separately.\n\n\nThe predation chamber was made of a 2-litre glass jar, wrapped\nentirely with black electrical tape to block any light, and filled to the\nbrim with 5 um Millipore-filtered seawater.\n\n\nThis chamber was covered with a tightly fitting black lid, placed\nonto a plankton \" roller &rdquo; and allowed to rotate at 0.83 + 0.02\nSD rpm.\n\n\nThe design of the chamber ensured the absence of refuges such as the\nsurface film and prevented prey congregating due to uneven light\ndistribution.\n\n\nThe prey were individually pipetted into the chamber to give\ndensities of 5, 10, 15, 20 litre  - 1  for   D.\naustralis   and   G. pectinatus   .\nTreatment densities of   Artemia   metanauplii\nwere 7.5, 15, 30, and 45 litre  - 1  .\n\n\nAll of these prey densities were replicated four times.\n\n\nFeeding time which lasted for 2 hours started when four unstarved\nadult mysids was introduced into the chamber.\n\n\nAt the end of the predation period, the contents of the chamber were\nemptied into plastic buckets.\n\n\nPredator and prey were removed and killed by placing them in vials\ncontaining 5% ( v/v) buffered formalin in seawater.\n\n\nFrom these preserved samples, predator total lengths and the number\nof remaining prey were determined.\n\n\nPrey total lengths were measured from the control jar individuals.\n\n\nNo prey mortality was observed in the control jars, thus any missing\nprey from the experimental predation chambers were recorded as captures.\n\n\nSince the three species of mysids consume their zooplanktonic prey in\nits entirety, ingestion/predation rates were expressed as number of prey\nmysid  - 1  hour  - 1  .\n\n\nStomachs were dissected out to verify fullness and confirm that\nmissing prey could be attributed only to ingestion. \n\n\n  Statistical Analysis  \n\n \n\nThe non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis single factor analysis of\nvariance ( ANOVA) was computed to test the null hypothesis that predation (\n=ingestion) rates between prey densities ( treatments) were equal, while\ntreatment means were compared using the non-parametric Q test statistic for\nmultiple comparison for unequal number of data with tied ranks ( Zar, 1984).\n\n\nThe functional response curves of the three mysid species were\ndescribed from the relationship between ingestion rate and prey density.\n\n\nCurve fitting was performed using linear regression with replication,\nand slopes were compared using analysis of covariance followed by a Tukey\ntest to determine significant differences between slopes ( Zar, 1984). \n\n \n\nAll statistical analysis was conducted using the computer program\nSYSTAT for Macintosh computers ( Wilkinson, 1992). \n\n\n  Results  \n\n\n  Functional Response to Various Prey Types  \n\n \n\nThroughout the functional response experiments, similar sizes of\n  P. rufa, T. tasmaniac   , and   A.\nmixta australis   , and the different prey types were used (\nsee Table 1) ( CV within species &lt; 5%).   \n\n \n\nVery low predation rates were recorded for mature  \nP. rufa   feeding on adult calanoid copepod prey, \n G. pectinatus   ( see Table 2).\n\n\nPredation rates in this largest mysid species ranged from 0.17 + 0.4\nSD at a prey concentration of 5 litre  - 1  .\n\n\n  P. rufa   predation rates on \n G. pectinatus   were lower compared to the other\nprey types.\n\n\nNo captures were recorded in the other two mysid species ( Table 2).\n  \n\n \n\nA highly significant variation was shown in the linear functional\nresponse curves of the three mysid species preying upon  \nArtemia  sp. metanauplii  (  F  = 6.26,  df \n= 50, p = 0.001).\n\n\nThe predation rate values in   P. rufa  \nwere lower than those in   T. tasmaniae   (\np&lt;0.0001), but comparable to   A. mixta australis \n ( p &gt; 0.05).\n\n\nThe predation rates on   Artemia  sp. metanauplii\n by   T. tasmaniae   were double than\nthose by   P. rufa   and   A. mixta\naustralis   .\n\n\nAll three species showed an increasing linear curve as against\nincreasing prey concentration ( Figure 1A). \n\n \n\nThe lowest average predation rate for   A. mixta\naustralis   was 0.36 + 0.08 SE ( standard error) metanauplii\nmysid  - 1  hour  - 1  at the lowest prey density ( Figure\n1A).\n\n\n  A. mixta australis   predation rates\nvaried significantly over the increasing prey concentration (  H  =\n8.67,  df  =3, p &lt; 0. 05).\n\n\nThe maximum predation rate of 1.77 + 0.43 SE was recorded at the\nsecond highest prey concentration of 30 litre  - 1  .\n\n\nThe mean predation rate at this prey concentration was only\nsignificantly different from those at the two lowest prey concentrations ( Q\n&lt; 0.05), while for the rest of the treatments, means were not\nsignificantly different ( Q &gt; 0.05 for all). \n\n \n\nThe average predation rates by   T. tasmaniae\n  also increased with increasing   Artemia \nsp. metanauplii  concentration with a minimum of 0.7 + 0.08 SE and\nreaching a maximum of 3.5 + 0.33 SE at 45 litre  - 1  (  H \n= 16.65,  df  = 3, p &lt; 0.01) ( Figure 1A).\n\n\nThe predation rate in the highest prey concentration differed\nsignificantly from that in the lowest prey concentration ( Q &lt; 0.005), but\nwas similar to the second highest prey concentration ( Q &gt; 0.05).\n\n\nThe latter was also significantly different from the predation rate\nat the lowest prey concentration ( Q &lt; 0.05), but not with that at the\nsecond lowest prey concentration ( Q &gt; 0.05). \n\n \n\nThe average predation rates by   P. rufa \n on   Artemia   sp. metanauplii followed a\nlinear relationship with increasing prey concentration, and these values\nvaried significantly (  H  = 14.25,  df  = 3, p &lt;0.05) (\nFig. 1A).\n\n\nPredation rates of <it   > P. rufa   ranged\nfrom 0.2 + 0.06 to 2.0 + 0.13   Artemia   sp.\nmetanauplii mysid  - 1  hour  - 1  .\n\n\nThe predation rate at the highest prey concentration differed\nsignificantly only with that at the lowest prey concentration ( Q &lt; 0.05).\n\n\nThe rest of the rates at the other prey concentrations were similar (\nQ &lt; 0.05 for all).   \n\n \n\nAt the lowest prey density, average   P. rufa\n  ingestion rate was 4 + 0.29 prey mysid  - 1  hour\n - 1  , and it continued to increase with increasing prey density to\na maximum ingestion rate of 11.75 + 0.48 prey mysid  - 1  hour \n- 1  at 20 litre  - 1  density ( Figure 1B).\n\n\nDissected mysid foreguts revealed 100% fullness while those with very\nlow ingestion rates showed 30% to 50% fullness.\n\n\n P. rufa  ingestion rates varied significantly with\nincreasing prey density (  H  = 14. 25,  df  = 3, p &lt; 0.\n01), although those at 5 and 10 litre  - 1  were the same ( Q &gt;\n0.05).\n\n\nThis is because two out of the four mysids fed at 10 litre  - 1\n treatment density and 1 out of the four mysids at 15 litre  - 1\n gave relatively very low ( 0.5 and 3 prey mysid  - 1  hour\n - 1  , and 2.5 prey mysid  - 1  hour  - 1  ,\nrespectively) ingestion rates.\n\n\nThese mysids were mature females without young in their brood\npouches, and perhaps were about to moult.\n\n\nMysid ingestion rates at the two higher densities differed\nsignificantly ( Q &lt; 0.05) from the two lower prey densities, but ingestion\nrates between the two higher prey densities were similar ( Q &gt; 0.05).\n\n\nThe functional response curve of  P. rufa  to increasing\ndensity of juvenile   D. australis   is linear (\nFigure 1B). \n\n \n\nIncreasing density of   D. australis \n did not increase predation rates in   T. tasmaniae\n  ( Figure 1B) (  H  = 16.66,  df  =3, p\n&gt; 0.24).\n\n\nVery few individuals captured the prey.\n\n\nThe lowest successful predation rate was 1 prey mysid  - 1 \nhour  - 1  , and the highest was 3.\n\n\nAverages from the four prey density treatments ranged from 0.75-3.25\nprey mysid  - 1  hour  - 1  . \n\n \n\nAs in   T. tasmaniae   , very few\n  A. mixta australis   captured the prey.\n\n\nA predation rate of 0.5 prey mysid  - 1  hour  - 1 \nwas the lowest, and the highest was 2.\n\n\nIncreasing prey density did not increase predation rates (  H\n = 4.13,  df  = 3, p &gt; 0.24), and the average ranged from\n1.25-2.75 prey mysid  - 1  hour  - 1  . \n\n \n\nThe functional response curves to the different  \nD. australis   concentrations by the three mysid species\ndiffered significantly (  F  = 49.86,  df  = 45, p &lt;\n0.001).\n\n\nThe variability was attributed to the significantly higher predation\nrates by  P. rufa  compared to those in the other two species ( p\n&lt; 0.001).\n\n\nThe predation rates of   A. mixta australis \n and   T. tasmaniae   showed no significant\ndifference ( p &gt; 0.05). \n\n\n  Discussion  \n\n \n\nThe functional response of predators may be classified into\ntypes I, II, and III ( Holling, 1959a,b).\n\n\nThe type I or rectilinear response is characterized by a linear\nincrease in consumption rate up to a certain prey concentration where the\nrate suddenly reaches a plateau and stays at zero with further increases in\nprey concentration.\n\n\nThis is exemplified by filtration rate of filter feeders such as\ndaphniids ( Rigler, 1961), and calanoid copepods ( Frost, 1972).\n\n\nThe type II or exponential response is an initial proportional\nincrease with increasing prey concentration which gradually decreases as\nsaturation level of prey concentration is approached; beyond this predation\nrates remain stationary with further increase in prey concentration as in the\ntype I functional response.\n\n\nThese two types of responses have been considered destabilizing to\npredator-prey interactions because of the capacity of the prey to damp\npredation rates by simply increasing its density.\n\n\nIn addition, at low prey density, predators could drive prey\npopulations to extinction.\n\n\nThis contrasts with the type III functional response in which\npredation rate remains low at low prey concentration and starts to increase\nat a certain higher prey density.\n\n\nThe type III functional response is stabilising to the predator-prey\ninteraction and is characterized by a sigmoid type of curve. \n\n \n\nA Type 2 functional response curve is commonly observed among\ninvertebrate predators ( Holling, 1965).\n\n\nA Holling type II has been reported in   M. relicta\n  preying upon the copepod   Epischura \n , but a Holling type III functional response was shown for another\ncopepod prey   Diaptomus   ( Folt  \net al.   , 1982).\n\n\nFulton ( 1982) reported a type II curve from laboratory experiments\non   Mysidopsis bigelowi   preying upon \n Acartia tonsa   .\n\n\nIn contrast, a similar laboratory predation experiment involving\n  M. relicta   and   Epischura\n  collected from a different location showed a linear\nfunctional response ( Cooper & Goldman, 1980).\n\n\nEstimation of   M. relicta   predation\nrates from field samples showed a similar linear type of curve which was\nattributed to food limitation ( Bowers & Vanderploeg, 1982).\n\n\nThese differences in mysid functional response have been attributed\nto prey vulnerability which varies according to prey types and their escape\nabilities ( Folt   et al.   , 1982; Fulton, 1982;\nOhman, 1988; Yen, 1983; McClatchie, 1988), predator hunger and feeding\nphysiology ( Yen, 1983), aggregative behaviour of both prey and predator (\nFolt, 1985), and temperature ( Fulton, 1983).", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "90dd9aed-7caf-4329-8937-a1cfcc0bbc5f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.199847+00:00"}

Samonte-Tan\n\n\n\n  ABSTRACT  \n\n \n\n Vegetative thalli of   Gracilariopsis bailinae\n  weighing 10 g each were tied to a 5-m monofilament line with\nplastic strips and laid horizontally on the substrate and were observed to\ngrow at 30 d interval for 9 months.\n\n\nThe monthly growth rate and yield were determined and a cost and\nreturn analysis of the culture system was made.\n\n\nThe monthly growth rate of the seaweed was significantly different (\nP=0.05) over culture month.\n\n\nThe highest average growth rate was 6.7% day  - 1  while the\nlowest was 1.7%.\n\n\nThe lowest and highest average yield ( dry wt) was 72 g and 660 g m\n - 2  mo  - 1  , respectively. \n\n \n\nA capital asset of &peso;1,680, working capital of &peso;2,980,\nand annual production cost of &peso;5,860 were calculated from the culture\nsystem.\n\n\nAn annual net return of &peso;31,292 was computed based on a 1,000 m\n 2  area.\n\n\nReturn on investment is 671.50% while payback period is 1.7 months.\n \n\n\n  INTRODUCTION  \n\n \n\n  Gracilariopsis bailinae   like\nother species of  Gracilaria  is a potential source of agar (\nHurtado-Ponce and Umezaki, 1988; Luhan, 1992; Hurtado-Ponce, 1992a).\n\n\nIts production from small-scale farming ( Hurtado-Ponce \n et al.   , 1992a), wild stock gathering for\ncommercial purposes ( Hurtado-Ponce 1992b), and its abundance ( de Castro\n  et al.   , 1991) in Western Visayas are\nmotivating factors to further develop the market value of this agarophyte.\n\n\n \n\nResults from experimental studies show that cultivation of \n Gracilariopsis   in cages, both monoculture (\nHurtado-Ponce, 1990; Guanzon and de Castro, 1992) and polyculture (\nHurtado-Ponce, 1992b) have been encouraging.\n\n\nStill, experiments with larger scale cultivation in mudflats,\ndrainage canals and estuaries are important to determine its economic\nfeasibility.\n\n\nThe   Eucheuma   fixed-bottom long line\ntechnique of Doty ( 1973) has been adopted in the present study because it is\ncost effective.\n\n\nThis paper describes the growth rate, yield and economics of\nfixed-bottom long line cultivation of   Gracilariopsis bailinae\n  in an estuary. \n\n\n  MATERIALS AND METHODS  \n\n \n\nThe study was conducted within a   Gracilaria\n  farm near an estuary at Leganes, Iloilo.\n\n\nVegetative thalli of   Gracilariopsis bailinae\n  ( =   Gracilariopsis heteroclada \n Zhang   et al.   Xia), approximately 10 g\neach, were tied to a 5-m monofilament line (\n#110) with 'tie-tie' at intervals of 10 cm.\n\n\nNine cultivation lines arranged in parallel to the current were laid\nhorizontally at 25 cm apart and tied to mangrove posts driven into the\nbottom.\n\n\nA 30-day growth period was observed for nine months.\n\n\nEvery month, all seaweeds were harvested, washed, cleaned, freed of\nepiphytes and finally weighed on a top loading weighing scale.\n\n\nThe original weight of the seedstock was returned with seedlings\ncoming from a selection of the harvest.\n\n\nMean daily growth rate in each one-month culture period was then\ncalculated according to Rueness and Tananger ( 1984). \n\n \n\nSome environmental parameters like water temperature and salinity\nwere monitored every sampling time using an ordinary Celsius thermometer and\nAtago refractometer, respectively, while water samples within the cultivation\narea were collected monthly for pH, NH  3  - N, NO  2  - N\nand PO  4  P analyses following the methodology described by\nStrickland and Parsons ( 1972). \n\n \n\nCost and returns analysis based on 20% moisture content was used\nto determine return on investment ( ROI) and payback period.\n\n\nROI was computed by dividing annual net income by the investment.\n\n\nThe payback period was computed by dividing the investment by the sum\nof the annual income and annual depreciation ( Shang, 1976).\n\n\nProduction costs were seed plants, plastic straw ( tie-tie), mangrove\npost, hired labor, and depreciation.\n\n\nDepreciation was computed using the straight line method based on the\nestimated useful life of the asset ( Meade, 1989).\n\n\nNet income was derived by deducting production costs from gross\nreturns.\n\n\nCosts and returns are based on a 0.1 ha area and the currency used in\nthe computations is the Philippine Peso ( &peso;35 = US &dollar;1).\n\n\nA partial budget for 'rice planting' and fixed-bottom long line was\nincluded to compare the marginal cost, marginal revenue and net benefit.\n\n\nMarginal revenue was computed as the difference of 'rice planting'\nrevenue from fixed-bottom line cultivation; marginal cost was computed as the\ndifference of marginal cost from marginal revenue. \n\n\n  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  \n\n\n  Line farming  \n\n \n\nThe average monthly specific growth rate ( SGR) ( Fig. 1) of \n G. bailinae   expressed as % increase in wet weight\nday  - 1  ranged from 1.7 to 6.7% day  - 1  while the yield\nranged from 72 to 660 dwt g m  - 2  and these were significantly\ndifferent over time ( culture month) ( P = 0.05).\n\n\nThe lowest SGR was recorded in March while the highest was in\nNovember.\n\n\nA decreasing yield was recorded for the first two months of culture,\nhowever, an increasing yield was distinct from March reaching its peak in\nJune which gradually declined in August.\n\n\nA sudden increase was recorded in September.\n\n\nDue to successive typhoons in October, the study was terminated on\nthis month.\n\n\nNo data was recorded for the month of February due to the adverse\neffect of pesticide coming from the neighboring ponds.  \n\n \n\n  Gracilariopsis bailinae   when\ngrown horizontally on lines with 'tie-tie' method varied according to culture\nmonth just like other species of  Gracilaria  ( Wang  \net al.   , 1984, Li   et al.   ,\n1984, Westermeier   et al.   , 1993).\n\n\nAn average monthly growth rate of 4.5% day  - 1  was\nrecorded in the present study which is comparable with the results obtained\nby Camara Netto ( 1987) on   Gracilaria   ( 4%\nday  - 1  ) using the same cultivation technique.\n\n\nHowever, when   G. bailinae   was grown\nvertically at different depth levels below the water surface with juveniles\nof sea bass in floating net cages ( Hurtado-Ponce, 1992b), the seaweed\ndemonstrated a much higher growth rate ( 13.3% day  - 1  ) .\n\n\nA similar observation was reported in   Gracilaria\nverrucosa   by Ren   et al.   , (\n1984) using floating raft ( 12% day  - 1  ) and fixed raft ( 10% day\n - 1  ) .\n\n\nBetter growth of seaweed is usually obtained near the water surface (\nKim and Humm, 1965).\n\n\nThe adoption of a culture technique to suit the prevailing\ncharacteristics of the study site plays a major role in seaweed cultivation.\n\n\nThe choice to adopt the fixed-bottom long line cultivation of \n G. bailinae   in this study was mainly due to the\nwater level during the lowest tide.\n\n\nIn the study site, the area was prepared into fishpond-like with dike\nelevation of only 30 cm.\n\n\nThis was done to allow approximately 25-30 cm of water to remain\nduring the lowest tide in order to avoid direct exposure to the sun and total\ndessication.\n\n\nAs a result, the seaweeds were exposed to constant change of seawater\nbrought by daily tidal changes. \n\n\n  Environmental parameters  \n\n \n\nWater temperature ranged from 28 to 32 &degree;C, salinity from\n26 to 33, and pH from 7.5 to 8.2.\n\n\nLowest water temperature was recorded in January, August and\nSeptember ( 28 &degree; C) while the highest in May ( 32&degree; C).\n\n\nThe lowest salinity of 26 coincided with the lowest temperature.\n\n\nThere was little variation in pH, NO  2  - N, NH  3\n - N and PO  4  - P readings during the entire cultivation\nperiod.\n\n\nHighest yield coincided with the lowest NO  2  - N, NH \n3  - N and PO  4  - P readings ( Fig. 2).  \n\n \n\nThe experimental farm experienced a lot of grazing especially\nduring the juvenile stage ( May-June) of siganids and mullets which\ncontributed to the loss of biomass and low growth rate.\n\n\nSimilar observations were reported in earlier studies ( Doty, 1986,\nNelson and Tsutsui, 1981, and Hurtado-Ponce, 1990).\n\n\nAssociated algae like   Polydiphonis, Hypnea \n ,   Rhizoclonium   ,   Ulva\n  , and   Enteromorpha   were\nobserved to appear during higher temperature ( Shang, 1976; Chiang, 1981).\n\n\nManual removal of these algae was done to reduce competition in\nspace, nutrients, and sunlight with the cultured species.\n\n\nHighest growth and yield coincided with lower water temperature and\nsalinity.\n\n\npH readings were within the favorable range ( Liu, 1987). \n\n\n  Costs and Returns  \n\n \n\nTotal investments for a 0.1 ha   Gracilariopsis\n  line farm amounting to &peso;4,660.00 included cash outlays\nfor capital assets ( &peso;1,680) and working capital ( &peso;2,980.00) for\nthe first cropping. ( Table 1).\n\n\nThe cost of production for a 0.1 ha   G. bailinae\n  line farm was &peso;5,860. 00 yr  - 1  , with 9\ncrops yr  - 1  ( Table 2).\n\n\nAt the current farm gate price of &peso;12 kg  - 1  ( dry),\ngross returns crop  - 1  was &peso; 33,024 ( Table 3).\n\n\nA net income of &peso; 31,292 yr  - 1  was computed with an\nROI of 671.5% using the line method.\n\n\nInitial investment is recovered in almost two ( 2) months.\n\n\n  Gracilariopsis bailinae   planted with\na fixed-bottom long line method compared with 'rice planting' yields a higher\nmarginal revenue ( &peso;23,112), marginal cost ( &peso;3,522.24) and net\nbenefit ( &peso;19,589.76) ( Table 4) which simply indicates that the former\nmethod of planting is more productive than 'rice planting' on the same\nplanting area.  \n\n\n *Computed using the straight-line method by dividing cost\nof asset.\n\n\nValue of the asset as scrap is assumed to be zero.  \n\n\n\n  1  Exclude opportunity costs of labor and\ncapital.  \n\n\n *Average SGR.  \n\n\n *Hurtado-Ponce   et al.   ,\n1992a \n\n \n\nCalculation of yield ( dwt g m  - 2  ) was based on a\nmonthly basis to estimate the lowest and highest value.\n\n\nHowever, for purposes of computing the cost and returns, average\nyield ( 344 dwt g m  - 2  ) for the 9-month culture was used.\n\n\nMinimum and maximum yield of 72 g mo  - 1  ( 6.5 dwt ha \n- 1  yr  - 1  ) and 660 g mo  - 1  ( 59.4 dwt ha \n- 1  yr  - 1  ) were calculated, respectively.\n\n\nResults of the present study are higher than those reported in \n Gracilaria   by Chiang ( 1981) in ponds ( 16-43 t ha\n - 1  ) and Liu ( 1986) ( 3.5 t ha  - 1  ) and in mudflats\nusing floating rafts ( 2 t ha  - 1  ) ( Liu, 1987).\n\n\nReports on   Gracilaria   farming in\nChile using polyethylene tubes filled with sand revealed a production of\n550-880 g mo  - 1  ( Buschmann   et al. \n , 1992).\n\n\nA much higher production of   Gracilaria \n in tanks was reported by Hanisak 1981 and Ryther   et al.\n  , 1979 ( 127 t ha  - 1  yr  - 1  ) and\nUgarte and Santelices, 1992 ( 41 t ha  - 1  year  - 1 \ndry).\n\n\nThese data indicate the potential of   Gracilaria\n  for sustained production in a commercial cultivation. \n\n \n\nThough an attempt to culture   Gracilaria \n species on long lines was made in discharge canal of shrimp ponds in\nThailand ( Chandrkrachang, 1992), there were no reports on growth rate, yield\nand economic feasibility.\n\n\nResults of the study suggest that fixed-bottom long line method of\ncultivating   G. bailinae   in an estuary is\nfeasible and possibly also in tidal mud flats. \n\n\n  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  \n\n \n\nThe authors are indebted to M.

{"text": "Exploratory Survey of the Distribution of  Oncomelania\nHupensis Quadrasi   \n\n\n Florencia G. Claveria \n\n \n\nIn the Philippines,   Schistosoma japonicum\n  , the causative agent of Oriental schistosomiasis, was first\ndescribed by Wooley in 1906.\n\n\nThereafter, infections were detected among inmates of Bilibid Prison\nin Manila ( Garrison 1908, Willets 1914), and among patients of the\nPhilippine General Hospital coming from the islands of Leyte, Samar,\nSorsogon, Mindanao and Luzon ( Hizon 1928).\n\n\nThese discoveries resulted in a number of surveys conducted on other\nendemic areas.\n\n\nHowever, it was not until 1951 that the Philippine government came to\nrecognize the extent and impact of the disease, leading to the creation of\nthe Division of Schistosomiasis in the Department of Health.\n\n\nIn 1952, the World Health Organization fully funded a five-year\nresearch project ( Santos 1976) which marked the beginning of the fight\nagainst schistosomiasis in the country. \n\n \n\nThe amphibious snail,   Oncomelania hupensis quadrasi\n  , was first recognized by Tubangi ( 1932) in Palo, Leyte as\nthe intermediate host of   S. japonicum   .\n\n\nLike other intermediate hosts of parasitic species,   O.\nh. quadrasi   is normally found in places where\nschistosomiasis is endemic. \n\n \n\n Schistosomiasis japonicum  is endemic in\nLuzon and in the Visayan Islands.\n\n\nMindanao also has several known endemic areas; in Southeastern\nMindanao--Davao del Sur in particular--the only places reported endemic for\nschistosomiasis prior to 1987 were Digos and Hagonoy ( Santos 1976, Hinz\n1984).\n\n\nThe first 12 human cases of schistosomiasis were reported among the\nnative Bilaans and Bogobos of the  sitios  of Demoloc and\nKilalag in Malita, Davao del Sur in 1987 ( Schistosomiasis Team Report,\nDigos, 1987).\n\n\nFurthermore, surveys conducted by the group indicated that the\ninfection was autochthonous or indigenous to the area.\n\n\nSuch a finding was indeed alarming, considering the possible\nestablishment of new foci of schistosomiasis transmission in Malita, Davao\ndel Sur, a place which was previously nonedemic for the infection.\n\n\nAlso in 1987, the Schistosomiasis Team in Digos conducted a survey of\noncomelanid snails in Demoloc and Kilalag, and found no oncomelanid snails.\n\n\n \n\nThis study sought to establish the presence or absence of\noncomelanid snails in the  sitios  Demoloc and Kilalag\nand, if present, to identify areas endemic for oncomelanid snails found to be\npositive for schistosome infection. \n\n\n  MATERIALS AND METHODS  \n\n \n\nDemoloc and Kilalag are adjacent  sitios  of\nMalita, Davao del Sur, located at a high altitude, and cover a surface area\nof approximately 11,000 hectares.\n\n\nThese places have a hilly terrain ( Figs. 1, 2 and 3), and are\ncharacterized by small bodies of water such as canals, creeks, swamps and\nrice paddies.\n\n\nThe place has a variety of vegetation ranging from trees to shrubs,\ngrass and weeds.\n\n\nDemoloc and Kilalag have a population of 7,450 and 3,570 respectively\n( Malita Municipal Office Census 1989).\n\n\nThese  sitios  could be reached by transportation\nvia a rough, steep and very narrow road, or by foot for about seven hours.\n\n\n \n\nSnail collection was conducted during three separate periods (\nMay 6-11, 1988 and September 1-8, 1988 in Demoloc and Kilalag; April 3-18,\n1989 in Talucanga, Malita).\n\n\nThis was done by either of the following methods: ( 1) submerging\nbanana leaves and fronds, dried corn cobs and coconut husks on the sides and\nbottom substrate of sampling sites like river, creeks, swamps and freshwater\nponds; ( 2) collecting submerged coconut husks or any bottom substrate with\nsnails attached to it; or ( 3) collecting bottom soil with snails, and\nwashing off soil particles with the use of sieves.\n\n\nPossible contact with cercariae-infested water was prevented by using\ngloves and boots during the entire duration of the survey and snail\ncollection. \n\n \n\nSnails collected were sorted according to size.\n\n\nThose snails bigger than 10 mm were discarded ( oncomelanid snails\nmeasure from 3.5 to 7.0 mm in shell height).\n\n\nUsing gross examination, all other snail species whose shell shapes\nwere obviously different from oncomelanid snails and similar prosobranch\nspecies were likewise discarded.\n\n\nThose snails that were left were fixed in 95% ETOH or 10% formalin,\nand were brought to the De La Salle University Biology laboratory.\n\n\nWith the aid of microscopy, those snails that exhibited features\nsimilar to oncomelanid snails were set aside for further examination. \n\n \n\nSnails that exhibited shell features similar to oncomelanid\nsnails were gently crushed, their liver organ cut off from the snail 's soft\nbody and teased lightly to determine the presence or absence of infection (\ni. e., presence of parasite larvae called sporocysts).\n\n\nThe entire procedure was carried out with the use of a dissecting and\na compound microscope. \n\n \n\nWater temperature, water depth and the general types and density\nof vegetation were noted.\n\n\nThe surface area of each sampling site was estimated with the use of\nan ordinary rope with markings and/or a carpenter 's measuring tape. \n\n \n\nDuring the initial sampling period ( May 1988), 5 of the 12\nindividuals identified by the Department of Health Integrated Provincial\nHealth Office and Schistosomiasis Team in Digos ( 1987) were located ( Figs.\n4 and 5).\n\n\nThe interviews with the parents of infected children and other\nenthusiastic folk helped the proponent to identify water-sites frequented by\nthe children which possibly served as the habitats of oncomelanid snails.\n\n\n \n\nThe data gathered by the Schistosomiasis Team in Digos ( 1987)\nfrom the examination of stool samples were made available to the proponent.\n\n\nThis facilitated the analysis of the prevalence rates of parasitic\ninfections other than  Schistosomiasis japonicum  .\n\n\nOther vital information extrapolated from the data are believed to be\nuseful in determining the level of treatment to be given to the town folk, as\nwell as in the development of strategies aimed at controlling parasite\ntransmission. \n\n\n  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  \n\n \n\nIn Demoloc and Kilalag, sites for oncomelanid snails included the\nfollowing: one long and winding river ( 4-5 m wide, 2-2.5 ft deep and 25 km\nlong, of which about 5 km were covered); five swamps ( 20-55 sq m, 0.5-4. 5\nft deep) with vegetation cover composed primarily of   Ipomea\nperstans   (  \" kangkong &rdquo;  ) ,\nweeds, shrubs and grass ( Figs. 6, 7, 8 and 9); three canals ( 300-600 sq m,\n1-1.5 ft deep) with weed decaying coconut husks, coconut and banana fronds\nand other decaying organic matter ( Fig. 10); one deep well and its\nperipheral area, and one creek ( about 4,500 sq m) ( Fig. 11).\n\n\nWater temperature in the sampling sites ranged from 16-29.6&degree;\nC.\n\n\n\n \n\nSeveral prosobranch and pulmonate snails were observed in the\nsampling sites.\n\n\nHundreds of those snails whose sizes approximated the size range of\noncomelanid snails were set aside and examined in the laboratory.\n\n\nThe five snail species examined were identified as two pulmorate\nsnails belonging to genus   Physastra   and genus\n  Myxas   , and three prosobranch snails\nbelonging to genus   Melanoides   , genus \n Vivipara   and genus   Tarebia \n ( Burch 1980).\n\n\nOnly one of the snails,   Melanoides sp   .,\na prosobranch ( shell morphology of young snails similar to   O.\nh. quadrasi   ) collected from a canal with decaying logs,\ncoconut husks and fronds, was found to be infected.\n\n\nOut of 342   Melanoides sp.   snails\ncollected, 92 ( 26.9%) were found to contain the intra molluscan larvae \nsporocysts  . \n\n \n\nDuring the third sampling period ( April, 1989), travel to\nDemoloc and Kilalag was impossible due to continuous heavy rains.\n\n\nThe proponent instead visited the  sitio  of\nTalucanga in the municipality of Malita, Davao del Sur and carried out snail\nsampling.\n\n\nTalucanga was chosen by the proponent as the alternative sampling\narea, as this  sitio  had also been identified by the\nSchistosomiasis Team in Digos ( 1984, personal communication) and by the\nMunicipal Health Office of Malita ( 1983, 1984, personal communication) as\nanother possible transmission site for schistosomiasis.\n\n\nThis hypothesis was formulated based on the death of two young boys\nwho exhibited clinical manifestations of an infection akin to \nschistosomiasis japonicum  .\n\n\nSites surveyed for snails in  sitio  Talucanga\nincluded one canal ( 150 m long), weedy and with decaying organic matters;\none river ( 76 m long 1. 5 m wide), stony and with less vegetation and one\nswampy place ( about 10,000 sq m; 0.5-2 ft deep) with   I.\nperstans   as the predominant form of vegetation, in addition\nto weeds and grass. \n\n \n\nOne of the small snails collected from a Talucanga swamp\nexhibited morphological similarities to   Melanoides sp.\n  , a prosobranch snail for fluke infection.\n\n\nThese snails were brought live to the house and were examined ( i.e.,\nthe shell was crushed and dissected, and 0.64% Ringer 's solution was applied\nto the exposed snail liver to induce  cercariae  to come\nout, if the snails were infected).\n\n\nThis procedure was necessary to verify earlier findings by the\nproponent regarding   Melanoides sp.   snails.\n\n\nInterestingly, the  cercariae  that emerged from\nthe liver tissue were  xiphidiocercariae  ( i.e.,\n cercariae  with an oral stylet) and not the \nbrevifurcocercariae  which are characteristic of the \nschistosome cercariae  that normally develop in oncomelanid snails.\n\n\nThis finding provided strong evidence that the prosobranch snail\nspecies collected from Demoloc and Kilalag found to contain sporocysts was\n  Melanoides sp.   and not   O. h.\nquadrasi   as earlier reported. \n\n \n\nNo oncomelanid snails were found in the areas or sites surveyed.\n\n\nThe negative results gathered from this study do not altogether imply\nthat oncomelanid snails are nonexistent in the area.\n\n\nThe proponent strongly believes that there must be places in the vast\nland area of Demoloc and Kilalag not covered by this study that provide\nfavorable breeding grounds for   O. h. quadrasi   .\n\n\nThe 12 documented human cases of  schistosomiasis japonicum\n among 3-to 5-year old children and a 33-year old female (\nSchistosomiasis Team, Digos, 1987) who have never left Demoloc and Kilalag\nlonger than necessary, strongly support the hypothesis that \nschistosomiasis japonicum  is autochthonous to the area ( i.e.,\ninfection was contracted from their own surroundings and not from other\nestablished endemic areas.) \n\n \n\nFurthermore, the time schedule as well as the frequency of snail\ncollection may account for the negative results of this study.\n\n\nWeeks before and during the sampling periods, on certain days, there\nwere continuous heavy rains which caused delay and difficulties in snail\nsampling.\n\n\nPesigan, Hairston, Jauregui, Garcia, Santos, Santos & Besa ( 1958),\nand Santos ( 1976) noted that the amphibious oncomelanid snail prefers a\nclimatic condition with no pronounced maximum rain period and no marked dry\nseason.\n\n\nLikewise, oncomelanid snails and their eggs, being very minute, can\neasily be flushed away by heavy rains and strong water current.\n\n\nProblems related to bad roads which made travel very risky ( Figs.\n12, 13 and 14), as well as problems of security and safety, prevented the\nproponent from carrying out snail sampling as frequently as should have been\nnecessary. \n\n \n\nThe proponent had earlier proposed to gather information related\nto the educational background of the town folk, and the services provided to\nthem in terms of sanitation, bathing, washing, recreation and potable water\nsource.\n\n\nInterviews with these people, however, indicated that the\nquestionnaire prepared for the activity was no longer necessary.\n\n\nThe first visit to the area revealed that the majority of the\nresidents only completed the primary grades, and very few reached the higher\nelementary grade levels.\n\n\nThe living conditions and surroundings of the people were obviously\ndestitute as evidenced by the absence of basic services for sanitation and\nhealth ( Figs. 15, 16 and 17). \n\n \n\nData on parasitological survey using fecal examinations (\nKato-Katz technique) carried out by the Schistosomiasis Team in Digos (\n1987), as analyzed by the proponent, showed a total of 846 collected stool\nsamples ( 718 stool samples from Kilalag; 128 stool samples from Demoloc).\n\n\nThe ages of the subjects ranged from less than one year to 74 years\nof age.\n\n\nStool samples analyzed totaled 344 and 278 for female and male\npatients, respectively.\n\n\nA total of 622 samples were pooled and analyzed by the proponent for\nepidemiologic data such as prevalence rates, and sex and age-distribution of\nthe infections noted.\n\n\nThe remaining 224 samples not included in the analysis either showed\nno findings or had no information about age. \n\n \n\nTable 1 shows the prevalence rates and the infection rates\naccording to the sex-distribution of helminthic infections diagnosed in the\narea.\n\n\nHookworm infection registered a high prevalence rate of 39.06%, with\nmore cases recorded in females ( 52.26%) compared to males ( 47.73%).\n\n\nThe identification of the specific causative agent of hookworm\ninfection cannot be determined based on stool examination.\n\n\nThe identification of hookworm species requires soil examination for\nthe presence of hookworm larvae rhabditiform and/or filariform ( Manalabng\n1925a).\n\n\nIt can be conjectured, however, that the hookworm infection noted in\nthe area may be of a mixed species,   Ancylostoma duodenale\n  and   Necator americanus   .\n\n\nThese two human forms of hookworms are endemic in the country, \n N. americanus   being the predominant species ( Cole\n1907a, 1907b; Craig 1903; Manalang 1925b, 1925c, 1926; Cabrera 1981; Tubangi,\nBasaca, Pasco & Rosario 1938; Tubangi & Cabrera 1948).\n\n\nOne hundred and eighty-six cases ( 76.54%) of hookworm infection were\nnoted among patients aged 30 years and younger ( Table 2).\n\n\nThe high hookworm infection rate and age distribution pattern noted\nin this study corroborate findings of other epidemiologic surveys conducted\nin other endemic areas in the country ( Tubangi & Cabrera 1948, Dominguez\n1969, Pesigan & Yogore 1965).\n\n\nLikewise, the rural agricultural setting of Demoloc and Kilalag\npositively correlates with the high hookworm prevalence, the infection being\ntransmitted via skin contact with contaminated soil ( Hinz 1984).\n\n\nThe higher infection rate noted among females compared to males does\nnot agree with the sex-related distribution pattern of hookworm infection\nreported in other endemic areas ( Pesigan & Yogore 1965, Dominguez, 1969).\n\n\nIt appears, though, that the higher infection rate in females may not\nbe real, considering the greater number of stool samples examined from\nfemales ( 344) compared to only 278 stool samples from male patients.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "8c9b7224-718a-4c9e-affd-f4773729ec9d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.201721+00:00"}
{"text": "Research and Policies Needed to Promote the Use of\nBotanical Biocides in Asia  \n\n\n Belen M. Rejesus \n\n\n  ABSTRACT  \n\n \n\nUse of botanical biocides is suggested as solution to problems\nassociated with synthetic pesticides, especially environmental pollution and\ntoxicity to non-target organisms.\n\n\nResearch initiatives to achieve full acceptance and policy action on\nresearch support, patenting and registration are discussed. \n\n\n  INTRODUCTION  \n\n \n\nOne of the greatest challenges facing the world today is the\nproduction of adequate food for a rapidly rising population.\n\n\nThe Population Reference Bureau ( U.S.A.) projected that the world 's\npopulation could expand from today 's 5.5 to 6 billion by year 2000 and 10 -\n14 billion by year 2045.\n\n\nThe pressure to increase food production has been particularly acute\nin Africa and in the developing countries of Asia.\n\n\nThe latter 's population is projected to rise to 4.9 billion by year\n2025. \n\n \n\nDuring the past 20 years, the Asia-Pacific countries such as\nAustralia, China, Japan, South Korea, India, Thailand, Malaysia, Bangladesh\nand the Philippines, increased rice production by an amount far exceeding the\nyield level achieved during the preceding decades.\n\n\nThis was due to the introduction of semi-dwarf, photo-sensitive and\nhigh yielding varieties of rice.\n\n\nThis was followed by the introduction of high-yielding varieties of\nother crops. \n\n \n\nHowever, the conditions favoring better crop growth also favor\nthe proliferation of pests and diseases.\n\n\nThe very technologies that help increase the yield per unit of land,\nwater, time and energy also often cause low yields due to pests.\n\n\nOn world wide basis, the pre-harvest losses due to weeds, plant\ndisease and arthropod and vertebrate pests range from 30 to 35% ( Cramer\n1967).\n\n\nPost-harvest losses may amount to an additional 10 to 20%.\n\n\nThe losses due to pests are indeed enormous.\n\n\nFor rice alone, the estimated value of yield loss due to pests in the\nPhilippines is about &peso;9.2B ( US &dollar; 360M).\n\n\nIn Vietnam losses is about 1.6M tons of harvested rice valued at\nUS&dollar;350-360M ( Highley 1995). \n\n \n\nAgriculture has been revolutionized by the use of material inputs\nsuch as quality seeds, fertilizers, irrigation water and pesticides.\n\n\nAmong these, pesticides and fertilizers account for a big portion of\nthe farmer 's production expense.\n\n\nIn the Philippines, pesticide input was estimated to be about 20-25%\nof the total cost inputs in the production of vegetables, rice and corn in\n1982. \n\n \n\nThe role of the synthetic pesticides in the green revolution in\nmany countries of the world cannot be underestimated.\n\n\nHowever, the indiscriminate use and overuse of these pesticides have\ncaused detrimental effects on non-target organisms, development of\nresistance, pest resurgence and environmental pollution.\n\n\nThese predicaments and the energy crisis in the late ' 70s prompted\nresearchers especially in South Asia to revive interest towards naturally\noccurring pest control compounds from plants. \n\n \n\nMore than 2,000 plants species reportedly possess pest control\nproperties ( Grainge and Ahmed 1988).\n\n\nPlants are doubtless an abundant source of active compounds which can\nserve as insecticides, rodenticides, molluscicides, bactericides,\nnematicides, weedicides, etc.\n\n\nThese compounds may act as toxicant and/or may influence the growth,\ndevelopment, behavior, reproduction and fitness of the pests in various ways.\n\n\nThese are categorized as toxicants, growth hormones or regulators,\nfeeding and egg laying deterrents, sterilants, attractants, repellants,\n etc.  \n\n \n\nPlants containing active compounds can be utilized directly or as\na basis for synthesizing novel pesticides.\n\n\nThe plants can be used directly in three forms or ways:\n\n\n1. As whole plant ( or parts) with simple processing: chopped, ground\nor extracted with water or organic solvent ( crude extractives);\n\n\n2. as active fraction extractive; and\n\n\n3. as formulated crude or active fraction extractive or formulated\nisolated active principle. \n\n \n\nIn this paper, I will use the term plant biocides or botanical\nbiocides to refer to the plant-derived products for pest control to\ndifferentiate it from the synthetic analogues of the active chemical compound\nfrom plants.\n\n\nThis is to remove the anathema to the word \" \"\npesticide &rdquo; \" .\n\n\nFor instance, natural pyrethrin will be botanical biocide and\nsynthetic pyrenthroids as botanical pesticides. \n\n\n  RESEARCH ACTIONS  \n\n\n  Technical Needs  \n\n \n\nIn whatever form the plant biocides are envisioned to be used,\nresearch has to address some technical, ecological, and socioeconomic issues\nto facilitate their acceptance in crop protection. \n\n \n\nFor a plant biocide to be accepted by the regulatory agency,\nfarmers and the public, data have to be generated about its activity and\nefficacy, cost effectiveness, safety to man and non-target organisms and\ndegradability in the environment. \n\n\n  Biological Evaluation  \n\n \n\nLaboratory and field screening are very important to obtain,\nproduce and eventually utilize potential biocidal plants.\n\n\nFig. 1graphically presents the different biological evaluation\nschemes of plant biocides that have been implemented in the laboratory of the\nDepartment of Entomology at U.P. Los Ba&ntilde;os. \n\n \n\nMany of the studies on botanicals in the region follow Scheme A.\n\n\nIn this scheme, the potential material can be selected rapidly and\nutilized with little processing like the use of  neem \ncake (   Azadirachta indica   ) and \nneem  oil ( Ketkar and Ketkar 1993) and the use of ground or\npowdered  makabuhai  (   Tinospora crispa\n  ) for broadcasting in the field ( Morallo-Rejesus and\nGarcia, 1988).\n\n\nBut this scheme does not answer questions on safety.\n\n\nIn 1988, we decided to follow Scheme B and recently Scheme C and D.\n\n\n \n\nThe very objective of Scheme B is to immediately identify the\nsafe extractives to man and/or fish ( if used in lowland rice) and the\nbeneficial insects of the target pests for immediate evaluation in the field.\n\n\nWith the knowledge that  makabuhai  extractive is very\nsafe, ( oral and dermal LD50 's mg/kg) I was confident in recommending its\nuse, which in earlier evaluations showed to be very effective against rice\ngreen leafhopper ( GHL), brown planthopper ( BHP) and rice stemborers (\nMorallo-Rejesus and Gracia, 1988).\n\n\nAlthough, plant extractives can be freely prepared and used by the\nfarmers without restrictions, surveys showed that most farmers would rather\nbuy the extractives than plant or procure and process it themselves. \n\n \n\nIf botanical biocides will be formulated and sold, it will be\nsubjected to the same government regulations as synthetic chemicals.\n\n\nAt present, the acute mammalian and fish toxicity data derived from\ntesting extractives are unacceptable to regulatory agencies.\n\n\nSafety to non-target organisms, stability and standardization are\nmajor questions to be hurdled before a product can be registered and sold to\nfarmers.\n\n\nThese requirements necessitate the isolation and identification of\nthe active principle.\n\n\nIn our recent works, active fractions have been isolated and\nbioassayed ( Scheme C) and/or purified, identified, formulated and field\nevaluated ( Scheme D).\n\n\nFor instance, rotenone was isolated from   Derris\nelliptica   and was formulated and evaluated in the field.\n\n\nIt was found to be effective against   Myzus persicae\n  and   Melanagromyza phaseoli  \non legume,   Atherigona oryzae   on corn and \n Plutella xylostella   on crucifers (\nMorallo-Rejesus, 1994). \n\n \n\n  Bioassay   .\n\n\nIn all the schemes, biological assays play a very important role in\nascertaining the toxicity on the target pests ( weeds, pathogens and insects)\nand non-target organisms. \n\n \n\nThere are a number of problems in the bioassay of extracts of\nmany plant species.\n\n\nThe activity of an extract may depend on the plant part used; the\nplace, method and time of collection, extraction and solvent used; the test\norganism ( age, stage, sex, rearing media); and the method of application.\n\n\nTo be able to accurately ascertain activity and select promising\nmaterials, there must be a proper biological assay.\n\n\nUpdated bioassay procedures are reported by Reichelderfer ( 1992)\nYopp ( 1992) and Redfern ( 1992). \n\n \n\nMany papers on botanical biocides particularly on insects in the\nPhilippines and other Asian countries reveal the usage of high dosages,\ninsect mixed sexes, and not so sensitive methods; the studies measure\ntoxicity effect only in their bioassays.\n\n\nThe bioassay for insecticidal action, for instance, should include\ntoxicity ( contact, stomach, ovicidal and systemic), deterrent to feeding (\nantifeedant) and egg laying ( anti-ovipositant), attractancy/repellancy,\ninsect growth inhibitory effect ( juvenile and moulting hormone mimics),\nsterilant effect,  etc.  \n\n \n\nA material exhibiting behavioral and growth inhibitory ( IGR)\neffects may tend to be selective and exclude man and other non-target\norganisms, hence, it will probably be more acceptable to the regulatory\nagency and the public, especially if utilized in the context of IPM.\n\n\nFurther, the additive effects can make the material more effective on\nvariety of insects and may have multifarious uses.\n\n\nSeveral plants such as  neem  ,  \nMelia   spp.,   Anoma  sp.  , \n Ayuga  sp.  ,   Vitex  spp.\n , etc. have been bioassayed for different activities.\n\n\nThe divergent effects of various preparations of  neem\n on different stages of the insect is shown in Table 1 (\nSchmutterer 1992) and of 14 plants from the Philippines in Table 2 (\nMorallo-Rejesus  et al.  , 1993). \n\n \n\nFurther the plant biocides should be evaluated against different\npest organisms to maximize its use.\n\n\nFor example,  neem  was found to be active on 250\ninsects but biocidal on certain viruses, fungi, bacteria, nematodes and\nsnails ( Ketkar and Ketkar 1993; Maini and Morallo-Rejesus 1993; Saxena 1993;\nSingh 1993, Warthen 1989).\n\n\nAmong the many plants evaluated at UPLB, ( Morallo-Rejesus \net al.  , 1993a), 20 plants show two or more biocidal actions (\nTable 3).\n\n\nThe ten promising plants evaluated for biocidal activity by most\nAsian countries are shown in Table 4. \n\n \n\n  Field Efficacy Evaluation.  \n\n\nIn many cases, on-farm evaluations of botanical biocides were by\nprophylactic treatments similar to the evaluation of synthetic pesticides.\n\n\nField trials are needed to determine the value of using botanical\npest control in the IPM system.\n\n\nThe trials should be on crops infested by target pests, replicated in\nseveral locations, and designed, implemented and analyzed in the same manner\nfor all locations.\n\n\n Neem  has been field evaluated in several\nlocations in the Philippines, India, Bangladesh, Thailand, Indonesia, Nepal (\nIRRI, 1992; Islam 1983).\n\n\nSome field trials showed that  neem  is effective\nagainst rice pests, including BPH, GLH and whorl maggot.\n\n\nOther trials showed  neem  to be ineffective\nagainst rice pests.\n\n\nThe differences could be due to the various sources of plants or\nextractives, formulations used, and the species and level of pest\ninfestations.\n\n\nThis was also observed in the evaluation of  makabuhai\n in three regions of the Philippines ( Adalla  et al.\n , 1993). \n\n \n\n  Phytotoxicity   .\n\n\nThe effect of the extractive with or without formulation on the seed\ngermination, seedling emergence, vegetative and reproductive vigor should be\ndetermined on the host crop of the targeted pests.\n\n\nSome data on the phytotoxicity of  neem  extracts\nand formulations were reported by Singh ( 1993).\n\n\n Neem  seed kernel ( NSKE) suspension at 0.5%\ncaused no phytotoxicity on cabbage, tomato, peas, onion, cucurbits, wheat,\ntobacco, rose, castor, litchi, fig, citrus, pomegranate, mango and maize.\n\n\nNSKE at 5% was not phytotoxic to rice.\n\n\nHowever, aqueous NSKE at 3% was phytotoxic to tobacco seedlings, and\n neem  oil at 10% to muskmelon at various stages of\ngrowth. \n\n\n  Formulation  \n\n \n\nBotanical biocides are generally easily degraded under UV light.\n\n\nThis constraint may be overcome easily by formulation.\n\n\nThis is a process of transforming a material into a product which can\nbe applied by practical methods to permit its effectiveness and economical\nuse.\n\n\nThe development of ready-to-use formulations is a must for easy\nadoption of botanical biocides by farmers who find the preparation of\nextractives to be cumbersome. \n\n \n\nThe material can be formulated as oil concentrates or solutions,\nemulsifiable concentrates, aqueous concentrates, dusts, wettable powders,\ngranules, aerosols, seed dressings, poison baits, encapsulated formulations\nand fertilizer mixtures.\n\n\nBased on the report of Singh ( 1993), a tabulation of the different\nformulations of  neem  is presented in Table 5.\n\n\n Neem  has been formulated for veterinary,\ncosmetic and medicinal uses.\n\n\nFive countries in Asia are formulating botanical biocides for farmers\nuse ( Table 6). \n\n \n\nAt the Entomology laboratory, three formulations of derris\ncontaining either crude extract, active fraction or rotenone ( active\nprinciple) were found to have reduced oral mammalian toxicity than the\nunformulated extractive or rotenone ( Morallo-Rejesus 1994; Ocampo 1994).\n\n\nThese were also effective in the field against DBM of crucifers,\nbeanfly and corn fly maggots.\n\n\nHowever, with the present government regulations on the use of\nformulated products, I cannot officially recommend these to the farmers. \n\n\n  Phytochemical Investigation  \n\n \n\nBotanicals are natural products which are hard to standardize,\nbecause of their inherent impurities and multiple chemical constituents.\n\n\nThe latter characteristics make the isolation and identification of\nthe chemical component(s) responsible for the activity complicated.\n\n\nThis difficulty can be overcome by international research\ncollaboration similar to  neem  . \n\n \n\nThe isolation and identification of the active principle(s) of\nat least one component of chemical group are necessary to standardize and\ndetermine the stability of the formulated product, the fate of the botanical\nbiocides in the environment and for registration.\n\n\nFor instance, the identification of azadirachtin, the principle\nresponsible for the antifeedant, IGR and ovicidal activity of  neem\n , crude extractives and active fractions of  neem\n seed have been formulated and standardized ( Larson 1986, Singh\n1993). \n\n \n\nIn the interest of having cheap pest control agents and for\nresistance management, it may be good if some variations and impurities\nremain in botanical biocides.\n\n\nThe activity of isolated active fraction or active principle is less\nthan the crude extract or mixed fractions or principles.\n\n\nThis has been shown in  neem  and marigold.\n\n\nIn marigold,  (  Tagetes  ssp.  - the\nactivity of Principle A ( 5-(3-buten-lynyl)2-2'bithienyl) or Principle B ( -\nterthienyl) is less than the activity of A+B or active fraction against\ndiamondback moth and BPH ( Morallo-Rejesus and Eroles 1980; Morallo-Rejesus\nand Decena, 1983).\n\n\nSchmutterer ( 1992) reported that   Azadirachtin\n  was less active than the  neem  oil or\nseed bitters and showed different effects on the larvae/nymphs and adults of\ninsects. \n\n \n\nExtractives formulation can be standardized based on biological\nactivity or specific activity as Sharma  et al.

{"text": "Strategies for Sustainable Cattle Production in the\nPhilippines  \n\n\n Cesar C. Sevilla \n\n\n  INTRODUCTION  \n\n \n\nMore than ever, the agricultural sector will experience\nsignificant changes and trends in production systems, economics and marketing\nof agricultural goods and processed food products.\n\n\nRapid population growth in many developing countries, the fast\neconomic growth and consequently changes in food consumption pattern towards\nhigh meat-low cereal intake in the Southeast Asian region, and the imminent\nshift to an international liberalized trade policy will accelerate major\nstructural changes in the country 's agricultural sector between now and the\nturn of the century. \n\n \n\nOf the many domestic agricultural products, beef is one commodity\nthat will greatly be affected by the repercussions of the development within\nthe ASEAN region due to the above factors which will, in turn, be manifested\nthrough domestic economy-wide, sectoral and institutional policies as well as\ninternational trade agreements.\n\n\nWith the ratification by the government of the General Agreement on\nTariffs and Trade ( GATT), the beef cattle industry, which has remained in\nthe doldrums for more than a decade now, requires more than just palliative\nmeasures if it is to recover under stiffer market competition. \n\n \n\nBecause of higher income due to rapid industrialization in the\nperiphery of the major urban areas, the beef supply has predictably lagged\nbehind an increasing demand for a product that has a high income demand of\nelasticity.\n\n\nThe increasing volume of live cattle and beef importation ( BAS, 1992)\nattests not only to an increasing demand for beef, but also to the inability\nof the domestic sector to satisfy the demand. \n\n \n\nGiven this scenario, the government will be under pressure\nwhether:\n\n\n1) to support domestic cattle production or rely more on importation,\n\n\n2) to satisfy the interest of the cattle producers or that of the\nconsumers and\n\n\n3) to allow market forces to dictate the price of beef or be\ninfluenced by government intervention. \n\n \n\nAny action taken by the government will result in a number of\nsignificant modifications in the production system, feeding management,\nbreeding and marketing of cattle, to which the commercial producers and big\nentrepreneurs are in the best position to respond accordingly.\n\n\nUnless sound strategies and development plans are drawn, the\nsmallholder cattle producers will be unable to cope with the forthcoming\nchanges in the production and marketing of cattle. \n\n \n\nEven with the proliferation of biotechnology to improve cattle\nproductivity, its beneficial effects at the national level will be felt only\nin a slow manner.\n\n\nThe long reproductive cycle of cattle and the difficulty in transfer\nof novel techniques to small farms contribute largely to the slow progress in\nimproving the productivity of cattle in the countryside.\n\n\nIt is therefore imperative to draw a long-term innovative master plan\nfor cattle production to ensure a steady supply of beef and to enable farmers\nto augment their unstable income from crops.\n\n\nThe fact that cattle are now in the hands of this sub-sector suggests\nthat further deterioration of the cattle industry will have its greatest\neffect on the well-being of the smallholder farmers. \n\n \n\nThus, this paper is an attempt to identify prospects and\nopportunities and problems in cattle production and to formulate appropriate\nstrategies/approaches to promote sustainable cattle production for the\nPhilippines.    PROSPECTS AND CONSTRAINTS TO CATTLE PRODUCTIVITY\n \n\n\n  A. Agroecological  \n\n \n\nThe Philippine cattle production system is currently at the\n\" pre-industrial &rdquo; stage, i.e. majority of the animals subsist on\nvalueless resources.\n\n\nHowever, a shift toward a higher level of intensification within this\nstage of cattle production is expected to materialize due to rapid\nurbanization, high demand for beef, stronger purchasing power, decreasing\nfarm size and increasing farm mechanization, but only if the support services\nare available and the policy environment is favorable. \n\n \n\n  Ranching   .\n\n\nOperations in ranching are deemed to become less and less viable\nbecause of problems regarding forest grazing land agreement ( FGLA) which is\nformerly known as the pasture lease agreement, unauthorized settlement, low\nproductivity, lack of infrastructure, and an unfavorable peace and order\ncondition and social and political environment now faced by ranchers.\n\n\nConsequently, ranching will become more and more location specific or\nconcentrated in marginal areas unsuitable to human migration and settlement\nand cash crop cultivation. \n\n \n\nDo we have the comparative advantage with this extensive type of\ncattle production system?\n\n\nWith FGLA priced as a relatively cheap primary cattle production\nresource at &peso;20.00/ha from only &peso;1.00/ha then, the production\nsystem favored and will continue to favor extensive management practices and\ndiscourage the application of technology or infusion of capital investment as\nwell as efficient allocation of resources.\n\n\nWhile safeguards exist for the proper utilization of leased pastures,\nenforcement of the lease agreement provisions is apparently lax based on the\ndegenerative productivity of the pastures, thus resulting in low cattle\nproductivity.\n\n\nRecent data gathered by Marban ( 1995) on the performance of selected\nranches in the provinces of Misamis Oriental and Bukidnon in Northern\nMindanao revealed a stocking rate of as low as 0.25 a.u. / ha, a calving rate\nof 54%, calf crop of 52%, and an extraction rate of 21%. \n\n \n\n  Feedlot   .\n\n\nThe proliferation of feedlots loaded with imported feeders which is\nan aberration of the cattle production trend as a result of an acute supply\nproblem, will not be sustainable and will be restricted by economy of scale.\n\n\n \n\nExpansion of feedlots will be deterred by three factors namely,\nfeed shortage, unpredictable supply and environmental concern.\n\n\nFeedlots are ideally established within an area where there is a\nconcentrated source of feeds ( pineapple canneries, beer plants, sugar mills\nand other agroindustries).\n\n\nThe size of feedlot operation is thus limited by volume of the\npotential feeds produced by these industries. \n\n \n\nUnreliability in supply and unpredictability of price will be\ndeterrents to expansion of feedlots other than those based on agroindustries.\n\n\nFor example, a severe drought in Australia will increase the price of\nthe feeder stock the following year.\n\n\nThe concentration of feed wastes and manure poses an environmental\nproblem since many of the independent feedlots are within the periphery of\nurban areas. \n\n \n\n  Smallholder Cattle Production System   .\n\n\nConsidering the wide array of appropriate agroecosystems for cattle\nproduction, the socio-economic profile of the country 's rural population and\nthe national concern for the environment, the potentially sustainable cattle\nproduction system for the Philippines will basically be ( a) smallholder farm\nsystem and ( b) supported by semi-intensive and agroindustrial-based systems\nof either feedlot or cow-calf operation ( Sevilla, 1994). \n\n \n\nBeing an integral part of farming systems, smallholder cattle\nproduction will remain at a low level if the productivity of the crop\nsub-system remains low.\n\n\nThroughout most of Asia, the rural-based ruminant industry has lagged\nbehind the swine and poultry industry due to the low adoption of technology\nand lack of feed resources.\n\n\nThe low productivity of ruminants associated with scarcity of feed\nresources will prevail as long as large land areas are tied to crop\nproduction.\n\n\nThis will prohibit the expansion of the feed resource base into\nimproved pastures, while the cost of by-product concentrates remains high.\n\n\nThe low adoption of cattle production in smallholder farms may be\nattributed to the low priority of ruminants in the allocation of the limited\nfarm resources. \n\n\n  B. Socioeconomic  \n\n \n\nThe country 's socioeconomic structure as well as the pre- and\npost-production schemes now in place in the rural areas are conducive to\nsmall-holder cattle production.\n\n\nThe existing intrinsic cattle operation schemes in the rural areas,\nif strengthened and fully supported by government, can be the starting point\nof an organized and efficient smallholder-based cattle production for the\ncountry. \n\n \n\nThe credit scheme, known as  \" paiwi &rdquo;\n  , is working extremely well, giving\nresource-poor farmers access to raise animals and therefore contribute to the\nefficiency of farm operations.\n\n\nIn Pangasinan, for example, up to 60 animals are loaned out under the\n \" paiwi &rdquo;  system to individual farmers by a\nsingle rural entrepreneur without cash outlay from the beneficiary and no\ninterest being charged.\n\n\nThis facility is adopted in many parts of the country and therefore\nis indicative of a viable informal non-cash credit scheme compared with\nsimilar programs of the government.\n\n\nThe success of the  \" paiwi &rdquo;  system\n vis-&agrave;-vis  government credit programs may also be\nattributed to some cultural values, which should be considered in the\nplanning stage of a cattle production program.\n\n\nThese successful rural entrepreneurs can be tapped as catalysts or\neven conduits of financial and technical services in the implementation of a\ncountryside cattle production program. \n\n \n\nMarketing is a complex factor affecting the cattle industry if\none considers the wide discrepancy between the farm gate price of cattle on\nthe hoof, the retail cost of beef in the wet market and the big differences\nin the prices of cattle in the different regions.\n\n\nLack of infrastructure, support services and grading system of\nlivestock, carcass and meat quality are factors that contribute to\ninefficient marketing of the commodities. \n\n \n\nIt is important to look at the supply side of cattle to be able\nto appreciate the intricacies and the future of cattle marketing. \n\n \n\nFrom 1980 to 1989, beef cattle progressively exhibited a decline\nin population as well as in production relative to other economically\nimportant ruminants, i.e. goat and  carabao  ( Table 1).\n\n\nCompared with the performance for the same species in the whole of\nAsia, the country 's cattle industry again lagged behind whereas those of\ngoats and  carabao  were within the Asian averages.\n\n\nThis is a clear evidence of a serious problem besetting the local\ncattle industry, the depletion of the supply of stock. \n\n \n\nIf any, the most notable change in the beef cattle industry\nprofile is the marked reduction of the population in the commercial sector by\nan average of 9.8% annually from 1983 to 1992 ( Table 2).\n\n\nHence, the inventory in the commercial sector now represents only\n9.7% of the total population from a high of 22.0% in 1983.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the smallholder sector exhibited a slower decline\nin population of only 0.4% over the same period and therefore now holds more\nthan 90% of the total cattle inventory.\n\n\nThese figures tend to suggest that the two sectors are relatively\nindependent of each other.\n\n\nOtherwise, a similar marked reduction in cattle population in the\nsmallholder farms would have occurred, since it has been presumed that the\ncommercial cow-calf or ranching operation supplies the bulk of the feeder\nstock requirement of the small farms.\n\n\nThis is noteworthy in that it implies stock replenishment within the\nsmallholder farms. \n\n \n\nThe number of cattle slaughtered has increased from 17% of the\npopulation in 1983 to as much as 31% in 1990 or an annual slaughter rate of\n26% ( Table 3).\n\n\nBased on these data, it can be deduced that the significant increase\nin the number of cattle slaughtered originated from the commercial farms and\nthat there was no drastic nor unusual unloading of the stock by the\nsmallholder raisers.\n\n\nThis is in consonance with the observation of a prolonged holding age\nof cattle among Asian farmers ( Jarvis, 1982).\n\n\nThe multi-utility of large ruminants other than as singular source of\nmeat, such as ( a) draft, security and milk, and its ability to survive on\nlow quality feeds, ( b) a hedge against price fluctuations \nvis-&agrave;-vis  the swine and poultry products, and ( c) the\ndifficulty in acquiring stock replacement, influence the smallholder farmers\nto hold on to their large animals unless there is an extreme necessity to\ndispose of their stock. \n\n \n\nThe smallholder sector will therefore remain for a while as a\nmajor source of cattle in the country, hence, development efforts should be\nexerted within this sector.\n\n\nOne possible socio-economic constraint will be the perception by the\nlocal producers of the government 's move to indefinitely resort to cattle\nand beef importation, which may dampen rural-based cattle production. \n\n\n  C. Biological  \n\n \n\nFeeds and feeding systems, breed improvement, and health and\nmanagement practices are the three biological aspects that need particular\nattention toward increasing cattle productivity.\n\n\nHowever, these disciplines are inseparably intertwined thus making it\nimpossible to dissociate one discipline from the other in packaging a\nspecific cattle production system for a given agro-ecosystem.\n\n\nOften, failure of livestock projects can be traced to incompatibility\namong breeds, level of nutrition and appropriate health and management\npractices ( Asian Development Bank, 1993).\n\n\nIn tropical cattle production, the matching of these resources,\nespecially the genetic potential of the animal with the available feeds, is\nof paramount importance ( Leng, 1989).", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "109e528e-3e72-4d0e-8bcb-a2690b7b9ea0", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.203950+00:00"}
{"text": "Mangiculture: An Update  \n\n\n N. D. Bondad \n\n\n  INTRODUCTION  \n\n \n\nMango is a fruit of the old world cultivated for 6,000 years or so\n( Hill, 1952).\n\n\nFrom its origin in India and IndoChina ( Bondad, 1989) mango has found\nits way in at least 87 countries ( Bondad, 1980).\n\n\nMango is regarded as the most important tropical fruit with an annual\nproduction of about 17.7 million metric tons ( FAO, 1993).\n\n\nThe prospects for the mango industry are very bright ( Bondad, 1980;\nHaines, 1991).\n\n\nMango has been the subject of national ( Plant Production Committee,\n1984; Thailand 's Mango Development Forum, 1978) and international forums (\nChacko  et al.  1991; Chadha and Pal, 1989).\n\n\nThe long history, widespread cultivation, economic value, number of\nworkers, and volume of research make mango growing highly eligible to have\nits own special branch in agriculture similar to citriculture or\nvitriculture.\n\n\nIt is surprising, however, that the term \" \"\nmangiculture &rdquo; \" never got into the mango literature. \n\n \n\nThe purpose of this paper is to define \" \"\nmangiculture &rdquo; \" and some other related terms often confused,\nmisused, or misunderstood.\n\n\nIt also aims to update readers on recent developments in mangiculture\nwith emphasis on Philippine conditions. \n\n\n  TERMINOLOGY  \n\n \n\n  Mangiculture   .\n\n\n  Mangifera   has 39 species ( Iyer,\n1991); at least five of these are cultivated, namely:   M.\naltissima   Blanco (  paho  ) ,  \nM. caesia   Jack (  bauno  ) ,  \nM. foetida   Lour.\n\n\n(  bachang  ) ,   M. indica \n . ( mango),   M. odorata   Griff ( \nhuani  ) .\n\n\n\" Mangiculture \" refers to the science and art of\ngrowing cultivars of   Mangifera indica   L. \n\n \n\n  Mango   .\n\n\nThis refers to fruits of commerce belonging to the species \n M. indica   .\n\n\nThe proposed definition of \" mangiculture \" agrees\nwith this statement.\n\n\n\" \" Mango &rdquo; \" , the common English term,\nwas derived from the original Tamil word  \" \" mangas\n&rdquo; \"  ( Singh, 1960). \n\n \n\n  Mangga   .\n\n\nIn Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines \"  \"\nmangga &rdquo;  \" is the local term for \" mango\n\" ( Kusumo  et al.  , 1975; Sukonthasing\n et al.  , 1991) and this is also a variation of the\noriginal Tamil word \"  \" mangas &rdquo; \n\" . \n\n \n\n  Mangos   .\n\n\nThe plural of \" mango \" in the U.S. and U.S. -\ninfluenced countries is formed by adding an \" \" s &rdquo;\n\" , hence \" \" mangos &rdquo; \" .\n\n\nThis usage does not follow the practice for such native English words\nas \" tomato \" and \" potato \" which form the\nplural by adding an \" \" es &rdquo; \" , hence \"\n\" tomatoes &rdquo; \" and \" \" potatoes &rdquo;\n\" , but \" \" mangos &rdquo; \" and \"\n\" avocados &rdquo; \" . \n\n \n\n  Mangoes   .\n\n\nThe Philippines, although very much influenced by the U.S., deviates\nfrom the American practice by spelling the plural form of \" mango\n\" with an \" \" es &rdquo; \" which is also the\nBritish usage.\n\n\nBarrett ( 1912) has pointed out 82 years ago that it is erroneous to\nwrite \" \" mangoes &rdquo; \" but it has become\ncustomary and acceptable and remained in use today. \n\n \n\n   Huani    .\n\n\nThe residents of Mindanao around Zamboanga often say \"\n \" mangga huani &rdquo;  \" when referring to\nthe fruits of   M. odorata   . This is improper\nbecause  huani  is a separate species.\n\n\nIt is easy to make this mistake because  huani  has\nall the external attributes of a mango fruit--size, shape, color -- but is\ndistinguished by its objectionable odor. \n\n \n\n   Paho    .\n\n\nThis is the common name for   M. altissima \n , a small fruit eaten immature with meals serving as an appetizer.\n\n\nThe fruit ripens green ( Bondad  et al.  , 1979).\n\n\nIn the Visayas, it is the local term for \" mango \" .\n\n\n \n\n   Carabao    .\n\n\nRaces are recognized in mango.\n\n\nFor the  Carabao  race the commercially-grown strains\ninclude \" \"  Carabao  &rdquo; \" ,\n\" 'manila' \" , and \"  'Lamao' \n\" .\n\n\nDe Leon ( 1916) described several other forms of  Carabao\n that may well be members of this race.\n\n\nOther well-known races of mango are Saigon, West India, Cuban, and\nHawaiian. \n\n \n\nA short ( 7.6 to 9.4 cm), ovate-oblong mango that remains green\nwhen ripe is improperly referred to in Davao del Sur as \" \nCarabao  \" .\n\n\nCalvo ( 1983) has described and named this mango as \" \"\nDigos \" \" , after a town where he conducted the work. \n\n \n\n   Pahutan    .\n\n\nThis is often confused for  paho  .\n\n\n 'Pahutan'  is a cultivar of  M. indica  much\nlarger ( 8 to 9 cm) than  paho  ( 5 to 5.5 cm) but small for\nan ordinary mango ( 12 cm).\n\n\nIt ripens with yellow skin and flesh, is very juicy but fibrous and\nthe seed is too large in proportion to the fruit. \n\n \n\n  Indian mango   .\n\n\nMany use the term \" \" Indian mango &rdquo; \"\nin referring to a small ( 8.0 cm long), roundish ( short oval) fruit best\neaten mature-green.\n\n\nIt ripens with green skin.\n\n\nThis mango is  'Kachamitha'  , one of several\ngrafted plants introduced from India in 1911 ( Bondad and Valmayor, 1979).\n\n\nIt is imprecise to use \" \" Indian mango &rdquo;\n\" because there are more than 1,000 different cultivars of mango in\nIndia ( Iyer, 1991). \n\n \n\n  Manila   .\n\n\nIn Mexico, 35% of the annual production is made up of the \" 'manila'\nmango \" .\n\n\n\" 'manila' \" is a cultivar of Philippine origin\nbrought to Mexico via the Galleon trade between Manila and Acapulco while the\ntwo countries were Spanish colonies from the 16th to the 19th centuries.\n\n\nIt is a member of the  Carabao  race and differs but\nslightly from the  Carabao  cultivar ( Bondad, 1989). \n\n \n\n  Manila super mango   .\n\n\nThe panel which represented the Philippine government during the\nnegotiation to lift the Japanese ban on Philippine mangoes \" invented\n&rdquo; the term \" \" Manila super &rdquo; mango \" for\ntrade of the fruit in Japan ( Castillo and Estocapio, 1975).\n\n\nThe Mexican 'manila' mango, which was already in Japan at the time,\nis promoted by this Philippine effort.\n\n\nThe term \" \" Manila super mango &rdquo; \" is a\nmisnomer and should be dropped. \n\n \n\n  Manila mango   .\n\n\nThe Ministry of Trade and Industry is using the term \"\n\" Manila mango &rdquo; \" to promote the fruit abroad ( CITEM,\n1983).\n\n\nTwo years later, the same promotions group inverted the words and\npublished \" \" Mango Manila &rdquo; \" ( CITEM, 1985).\n\n\nEither way, the Mexican mango industry is favored.\n\n\nApparently, \"  'Carabao'  \" is\nunattractive to the Ministry officials for promotion abroad but this is the\nname that made the Philippines famous for mango and \"  'Carabao'\n \" is recognized internationally for well over half a\ncentury now.\n\n\nBesides, the effort to change it is not helping the Philippine mango\nindustry. \n\n\n  ESTABLISHMENT  \n\n\n  Seedling Trees  \n\n \n\nIn the old system of establishing mango trees, seeds are sown and\nplants are set very far from each other.\n\n\nRaising mangoes the old way had its roots during the Spanish time (\n1521-1898) in the Philippines.\n\n\nThe Spaniards brought many crops here but mango was not one of them\ncontrary to Ochse  et al.  's ( 1961) claim that Spanish\nvoyagers introduced mangoes from India to Manila.\n\n\nThey are not credited for this important crop but it was under their\nrule that plantings of mango became established.\n\n\nThe plants they allowed to proliferate are from seeds and failed to\nintroduce asexual propagation which has been in use elsewhere even before\ntheir arrival here.\n\n\nIt was in this era that huge, present-day, century old trees became\nestablished.\n\n\nOne such tree in Lagangilang, Abra is 23 m tall and 25 m wide.\n\n\nSeedling trees in orchard are slightly smaller ( 20 m) but\nnevertheless huge and the wide canopy spread is the basis of the old system\nof planting.\n\n\nMuch of the backyard plantings are seedling trees that comprise a\nlarge portion of today 's mango industry.\n\n\nCabotage ( 1975) estimated this to be about 95%.\n\n\nThe number of grafted trees is increasing but their proportion is\nunknown. \n\n\n  Grafted Trees  \n\n \n\nAmong the early contributions of Americans to Philippine\nagriculture was asexual propagation.\n\n\nIn 1912, Wester described various techniques and in the same year\nrecommended to plant the crop at a distance not less than 10 m and preferably\n12 to 15 cm.\n\n\nThese statements are rather too early for a newcomer to the\nPhilippines.\n\n\nThe oldest grafted tree then would not be more than 10 years,\nAmericans having arrived only between 1900 and 1910.\n\n\nIt takes a grafted tree about 25 to 30 years to become full-grown.\n\n\nThe canopy spread of a full-grown tree is the basis of determining\nthe planting distance ( Galang, 1995).\n\n\nA possible reason for coming up with a recommendation that early is\nthe American experience on mango growing in Florida where trees are set at an\naverage of 11 ( Young and Sauls, 1978) and 12 m ( Ruehle and Ledin, 1955).\n\n\nMango trees are expected to be more vigorous under tropical\ntemperatures and heavy rainfall in the Philippines, hence Wester 's ( 1912)\npreference for a wider distance ( average of 13.5 m).\n\n\nIn a later bulletin on mango growing, Wester ( 1920) maintained his\n1912 recommendations. \n\n \n\nFilipino mango workers either did not believe the American\nhorticulturist; were still influenced by the old system of planting seedling\ntrees at wide distances; or had no basis to draw from orchards of grafted\ntrees being quite young at the time.\n\n\nWorkers at the Department of Agriculture and Commerce ( 1939), Bureau\nof Plant Industry ( Lazo, 1956), and Araneta Institute of Agriculture (\nGalang, 1955) recommended distances of 16 to 20 m, 20 m, and 16 to 18 m,\nrespectively. \n\n \n\nLater authors ( Angeles, 1989; Cuevas, 1976; Lazo and Gonzales,\n1970; Mango Committee, 1975, 1978; Valmayor  et al.  ,\n1971) gave mostly 14 m and this has become traditional practice; although\nthey provided no data or explanation.\n\n\nOur measurements of full-grown grafted trees in three large orchards\nwhich averaged 14.5 m tend to support what has become traditional distance of\nplanting grafted  'Carabao'  mango trees. \n\n\n  High Density Planting  \n\n \n\nEstablishing mango the modern way in part means setting grafted\ntrees much closer than the old or traditional distance, resulting in high\npopulation per hectare.\n\n\nGrowers have long planted the mango at close spacing.\n\n\nI have seen, for example in 1980, 8 to 10-year-old grafted  'Carabao'\n mangoes planted 7 x 7 m in Cuenca, Batangas.\n\n\nMany other orchards have gone high density but the first massive\nplanting was in 1982 with the establishment of 46,000 grafted  'Carabao'\n mangoes in Silang, Cavite at a distance of 5 x 8 m ( Tividad\n et al.  , 1984).\n\n\nWhen last counted in 1992, there were only 12,000 hills.\n\n\nTrees were abandoned completely in 1986, when another massive\nplanting also at 5 x 8 m of more than 45,000 trees began in Guimaras. \n\n \n\nA common observation among growers of closely-planted mangoes is\nfailure to perform intensive cultivation required of high density systems.\n\n\nAs a result in Cavite, for example, trees became overcrowded making\nleafhopper control very difficult.\n\n\nThe same problem will be met with anthracnose, a view held earlier\nby Ruehle and Ledin ( 1955), because the situation creates a more favorable\ncondition for the growth of the fungus.\n\n\nOvercrowding will prevent a thorough spraying for full canopy\ncoverage aggravating pest attack.\n\n\nThere is also a tendency for trees to produce few fruits and these\nare usually of poor quality under overcrowded condition. \n\n\n  Systematic Removal  \n\n \n\nRemoval of trees in alternate rows is standard recommendation in\nthe growing of temperate fruits in which the practice is long known (\nWestwood, 1978).\n\n\nNo similar experience is available on mango and much of the\nstatements on the subject ( Bondad  et al.  , 1995) are\nbased on separate pieces of information put together.\n\n\nUseful data consist of canopy spread of relatively young trees.\n\n\nIn Los Ba&ntilde;os, Laguna 5 to 6-year-old grafted  'Carabao'\n mango trees have canopy spread of 4.6 to 6.4 m ( Medina, 1984).\n\n\nThirteen-year-old  'Carabao'  mango trees, also\ngrafted in Jordan, Guimaras, are 9.0 m wide ( Covacha, 1986).\n\n\nAll trees measured were well managed. \n\n \n\nBased in part on the preceding observation, Bondad  et\nal.  ( 1995) suggested 4 x 6 m for the establishment of a high\ndensity plantation in Rizal. \n\n \n\nThinning may begin on the fifth or sixth year by removing\nalternately whole lines of in-row trees leaving a 6 x 8 m planting.\n\n\nThe next thinning will depend on the rate of growth but on the 10th\nyear, trees 6 m apart will have definitely overlapping canopies.\n\n\nIf this row is removed, the remaining trees will be crowded after 10\nyears but it will be spacious on the 12 m side so that the next thinning may\nbe delayed.\n\n\nThere is sufficient working space for thorough pesticide spraying of\ncanopies.\n\n\nIn the end, the distance will be 12 x 16 m. \n\n \n\nThe above suggestion may not hold in other situations because of\ndifferences in soil, climate, and culture among other factors.\n\n\nNevertheless, it is a possible program for a systematic removal of\ntrees which should apply where the growing conditions are met.\n\n\nCanopy spread elsewhere may differ but not too greatly and where\nnecessary, a grower could make adjustments to fit his local needs. \n\n \n\nIncidentally in Thailand, 4 x 6 m is apparently suggested too\nand one 352-ha orchard was planted actually at this density.\n\n\nPlantings at much closer distances ( e.g., 2.5 x 2.5 m) have been\nreported in Thailand ( Charnvichit  et al.  , 1991;\nKhumlert, 1990).", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "fe8c8580-b552-4174-8642-2ae99a02a7db", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.205391+00:00"}
{"text": "Textile Cement Composite: A Potential Lightweight Building\nMaterial  \n\n\n Joseph Ramil I. Manalo \n\n \n\n Textile waste cuttings mixed with cement as binder produce a\nunique kind of composite material that looks like concrete but can be cut or\nnailed like wood.\n\n\nIt exhibits certain physical and mechanical properties indicating its\npotential for low-cost lightweight construction. \n\n \n\nThe result of the laboratory tests indicate a sturdy\nlighter-than-concrete building material with various potential uses--for\nceilings, walls, wooden board substitute, or as an economical alternative\nconcrete block.  \n\n \n\nThe research conducted shows that textile waste cuttings when\nmixed with cement as binder produces a unique kind of composite material that\ncan be used for low-cost lightweight construction.\n\n\nThe composite material looks very much like an ordinary \"\nconcrete product &rdquo; but weighs like an ordinary lumber. \n\n \n\nThe research is timely and relevant for statistics show that the\ndisposal of textile waste cuttings will soon become a major problem.\n\n\nThe textile cuttings are usually disposed of as waste product which\nbecome an environmental nuisance because of its non-biodegradability, or\nburned in heaps thus releasing highly toxic fumes in the surrounding air.\n\n\nDue to the influx of these voluminous wastes in our environment, we\nought to find ways of turning it into useful materials.\n\n\nThis study explores the possible ways to warrant the production of\nnew products from waste materials - - textile cuttings. \n\n \n\nThis focuses on the technical aspect of making test samples and\nthe determination of textile-cement material 's specific weight, water and\nmoisture absorptions, compressive, tensile and flexural strengths. \n\n \n\nAn economic feasibility study of the said research is of much\nimportance as the technical aspect.\n\n\nAn in-place cost comparison of textile-cement material and commonly\nused plyboards and lumber for ceiling and partitions supply the needed data\nfor its market feasibility analysis. \n\n \n\nIts physical and mechanical properties indicate its potential as\na substitute material for some concrete products yet lighter and more\neconomical than concrete, as substitute for wooden board yet sturdier and\nmore fire resistant than wood. \n\n\n  MATERIAL COMPONENTS  \n\n \n\nThe composite material is produced from a mixture of textile\nwaste cuttings, portland cement and water.\n\n\nIn the study, the textile waste cuttings are taken from a shirt\nmanufacturing firm and from a garment factory.\n\n\nThe textile consists of cotton, polyester, silk and rayon.\n\n\nA homogenous single type of textile usually consists of a combination\nof these materials in various percentages. \n\n \n\nPortland cement mixed with water is used as binder.\n\n\nAs in all concrete materials using hydraulic cement, the cement paste\nor binder is actually the result of a chemical reaction between cement and\nwater.\n\n\nThe said chemical reaction, characterized by hydration, continues\neven for many days until the binding medium plus any embedded particles in it\nis said to have sufficiently hardened, usually for a period of 28 days. \n\n \n\nIn the textile-cement composite material under study the textile\ncuttings may not be conceived as either an aggregate or reinforcement.\n\n\nHowever, they contribute to the increase in volume of the mixture (\nwhich is the major function of an aggregate) less the weight, and contribute\nto the increase in the tensile resistance ( which is the major function of\nthe reinforcement) due to its fibrous nature. \n\n\n  FABRICATION OF SAMPLES  \n\n \n\nThe textile waste cuttings are trimmed into average lengths of 2\ncm. and 6 cm., and mixed with portland cement in textile-cement ratios of\n1:3, 1:4 and 1:5 by weight.\n\n\nWater is added in amounts corresponding to water-cement ratios\nranging from 0.53 to 0.85. \n\n \n\nExperimental blocks with dimensions of 2.5 cm. x 9.5 cm. x 14.5\ncm. are fabricated and tested for tension and flexure, while cubes of 5 cm. x\n5 cm. are used for compression tests. \n\n \n\nThe different steps in fabrication are shown in Figure 1. \n\n\n  LABORATORY TESTS  \n\n \n\nThe 54 samples tested represent the 18 design mixes, that is, 3\nreplicates per design mix.\n\n\nThe number of design mixes resulted from varying the quantities of\nthe 3 material components: textile, cement and water.\n\n\nThe variations were expressed in terms of fiber-cement ratio by\nweight, water-cement ratio by weight and textile length.\n\n\nTwo textile lengths were used: 2 cm. ( designated as S for short\nfibers) and 6 cm. ( designated as L for long fibers).\n\n\nThe mix combinations are shown in Figure 2. \n\n \n\nThe samples were evaluated for unit weight, water and moisture\nabsorption, biodegradability, flammability, compressive, tensile and flexural\nstrengths.\n\n\nIn the study, evaluation on biodegradability was done, not by\nlaboratory test, but by analyzing the chemical composition and properties of\nthe fiber based on data obtained from the Department of Science and\nTechnology and from the Philippine Textile Research Institute.\n\n\nTests on flammability consisted of subjecting the samples to open\nflame from a gas stove for a period of 30 minutes. \n\n \n\nPhysical tests for the determination of its density, water and\nmoisture absorption were conducted at  Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng\nMaynila   -\nEngineering Laboratory.\n\n\nAn oven was used to determine the oven-dry weights of the samples.\n\n\n \n\nMechanical tests to find the flexural, tensile and compressive\nstrengths of the samples were done using the Universal Testing Machine ( UTM)\nof the Construction Manpower Development Foundation ( CMDF) at Bo.  Salawag, Dasmari&ntilde;as,\nCavite.\n\n\nThe UTM used has a 50 ton-force capacity. \n\n \n\nThe above mentioned tests are in accordance with the ASTM\nstandards for testing materials. \n\n\n  TEST RESULTS \n\n \n\nLaboratory results from tests conducted, are presented in Table 1\nand 2.\n\n\nResults show that the textile-cement materials behaved differently\nfor every controlled variable.\n\n\nNevertheless, these data have been analyzed for their possible\nvariances.\n\n\nThis is to determine the accuracy of the experiment through the\nresults obtained. \n\n \n\nThe reliability of the experiment was evaluated using analysis of\nvariance ( ANOVA) and regression analysis as the curve fitting tool to show\nthe trend of effects of different controlled variables using Table A shown.\n\n\n \n\nIn general the reliability of the experimental data can be\naccepted at 99% confidence interval being it not random samples of a bigger\nsample size.\n\n\nThe relation between the dependent and independent variables is given\nby the correlation coefficients which register greater than 90% showing a\nvery good relation.\n\n\nThe relatively high values of correlation coefficient indicate that a\nlinear regression analysis can be used as a tool in projecting values of Y\nfor certain values of X. \n\n \n\nA tabular summary of the findings is shown to clearly present the\neffects of the different variables to the physical and mechanical properties\nof the textile-cement material.\n\n\nThis presents the possible trends of effects these variables give on\nthe properties of textile-cement material. \n\n \n\nWater-cement ratio varies inversely with the specific weight,\ncompressive, tensile and flexural strengths of the material.\n\n\nAlso it varies proportionately with the water and moisture\nabsorption. \n\n \n\nCement-fiber ratio varies proportionately with the specific\nweight, compressive, tensile and flexural strengths.\n\n\nFurthermore, it varies inversely with the water and moisture\nabsorption of the material. \n\n \n\nThe size of the textile fiber affects the properties of the\nmaterial.\n\n\nLong fibers produce better results than that of the short fibers.\n\n\n \n\nUpon evaluation of the chemical compositions of the fibers used,\nthe material shows a high degree of non-biodegradability and after being\nsubjected to direct open fire, shows zero flammability making it a good\nfire-resisting material. \n\n \n\nFrom the standpoint of economics, an in-place analysis of the\ndifferent material and specification combination for ceiling and partitions\nshows that a savings ranging from 59.81 to 97.97 pesos per square meter and\n172.63 and 253.48 pesos for ceiling and partitions, respectively, can be\nobtained utilizing the TCM as substitute material for plywood, as shown in\nTables 6 and 7.\n\n\nTCM at different fiber-cement ratios combined with ordinary 50 cm. by\n50 cm. ceiling joists and wall studs at various spacing is compared with an\nordinary plyboard ceiling and walling.\n\n\nSavings are derived mainly from the substitution of TCM for plywood.\n\n\nDifferences in the in-place cost of the two materials at various\ncombinations show big savings if TCM is used. \n\n \n\nThis clearly indicates that TCM is a money saving material for\nthe construction industry. \n\n\n  CONCLUSION  \n\n \n\nThe textile cuttings, when mixed with hydraulic cement as binder,\nproduce a composite material that can be used for low-cost lightweight\nconstruction. \n\n \n\nThe composite material has physical and mechanical properties\nthat make it a potential substitute for some concrete products as well as a\nsubstitute for wooden boards. \n\n \n\nConsequently, the use of textile waste cuttings in construction\nmay solve two problems, namely, elimination of an environmental pollutant and\nprovision of an alternative material for the construction industry. \n\n\n  RECOMMENDATION  \n\n \n\nIt is therefore recommended that the use of textile-cement\nmaterial be encouraged to provide people with new class of construction\nmaterial of comparable strengths and other potential properties as\nlightweightness, non-biodegradability and fire-resistant.  \n\n\n\n\n  Production Line Balancing ( Or Why 1 + 1 Is Not Equal to 2\nor 3)  \n\n\n Rumel V. Atienza \n\n\n  > Abstract \n\n \n\nLINE BALANCING is among the basic concepts in production and\noperations management which are often misunderstood.\n\n\nThis article explains, through the use of simulation, why bottleneck,\nidle capacity, and delay occur due to production line imbalance.  \n\n \n\nWith the advent of the synergy concept, the expression 1 + 1 is\nno longer solely equal to the mathematically correct answer of 2, but is also\nequal to 3.\n\n\nManagement scientists and behavioral psychologists believe and have\nproven that the concerted effort of two human beings can result in an output\nmuch greater than the combined outputs of the two working separately. \n\n \n\nBut the idea that 1 + 1 is not equal to 2 has for long been\ncommon knowledge among production managers and engineers, only this time, the\nanswer is not equal to 3; instead it is equal to less than 1. \n\n \n\nTo illustrate: consider a continuous production line composed of\neight sewing operators ( sewers) producing pants.\n\n\nIf it takes 20 minutes to produce one pair of pants, how many pants\ncan be produced by the production line in an eight-hour working day?\n\n\nSupposedly, the answer is 192 pairs ( = 8 hr/man-day x 60 min/hr x 8\nman/day / 20 min/pair).\n\n\nIn a majority of cases, however, the production line produces much\nless than 192 per day, even if men and machines are efficient.\n\n\nThis happens because the production line is imbalanced. \n\n \n\nIn almost all production set-ups, whether continuous, batch or\njob shop, products are processed through work sections, each section\nproducing or attaching one component of the product rather than each section\nproducing one complete unit of the product.\n\n\nBalance in the production line refers to the equality of the rates of\noutput ( called capacity) of the work sections.\n\n\nWhen imbalance exists, the maximum capacity for the whole line is\nequal to the capacity of the slowest section, termed as the \" \"\nbottleneck &rdquo; operation \" , and idle capacity exists in all\nother sections, except in the bottleneck. \n\n\n  A Simulation of the Production Process  \n\n \n\nTo better appreciate the meaning of line balance, capacity and\nbottleneck, let us take a look at this simulation of a simple production\nsystem.\n\n\nThis production process is composed of six activities, namely: A, B,\nC, D, E and F.\n\n\nActivity A has to be performed before B, C, or D can be performed,\ni.e., A is a precedent of B, C, and D.\n\n\nSimilarly, activity E cannot be performed until B, C and D are\ncompleted.\n\n\nActivity F, on the other hand, must be preceded by E.\n\n\nTable 1 shows this necessary precedence between activities and the\ntime required to finish each activity.\n\n\nFigure 1 shows the precedence chart of this production system. \n\n \n\nSuppose that each activity is assigned to one section composed of\none man ( or man-and-machine).\n\n\nWe will simulate the production process to determine the following\nparameters:\n\n\na. Time it takes to finish one unit of output with minimum delay\n\n\nb. Capacity or the output per given time of this line\n\n\nc. Idle capacity available \n\n \n\nWith a simulation interval of 10 seconds, let us take a look at\nthe first stage of the simulation, corresponding to the first 200 seconds (\nsee Table 2). \n\n \n\nIt can be observed from this simulation that unit 1 has been\ncompleted without any delay ( start at t = 0 and end at t = 180).\n\n\nUnit 2, however, incurred a 10 sec. delay after t = 140 since all\nsections were loaded with work.\n\n\nCompletion time is expected to be equal to 190 seconds.\n\n\nUnit 3 incurred a delay of 50 seconds, thus expected completion time\nis at least 230 ( =180+50) seconds. \n\n \n\nObserve that from the 90th second upward, section A was idle.\n\n\nActivities were temporarily stopped in A since the other sections\nwere still loaded.\n\n\nSection A can afford to be idle.\n\n\nThis move is logical, especially if the product or raw materials are\nperishable, or if management wishes to minimize work-in-process inventory, or\nminimize processing time in the production line, among other reasons.\n\n\nFor simulation purposes, we impose this policy to be more realistic\nabout the average earliest completion time of one unit of output.\n\n\nThis \" constraint, &rdquo; however, can be removed if we are\nnot at all interested in measuring parameter ( a). \n\n \n\nSince the first stage of any simulation process may not be\nindicative of the actual trends of the production parameters we want to\nmeasure, let us continue with the simulation until 1000 seconds.\n\n\n( Please see Table 3 and Table 3a for the simulations).\n\n\nTable 3 simulation will be used to measure the capacity, bottleneck\nand idle capacity.\n\n\nTable 3a will be used to determine the time for a unit to be\ncompleted with minimum delay.\n\n\nFrom these tables we can conclude the following about the parameters\nwe want to measure:\n\n \n\na.   Completion time of each unit   .\n\n\nLonger simulation will result in average completion time approaching\nthe limit equal to 180 seconds ( as can be observed from the later units\nproduced).\n\n\nThis 180 seconds is merely the sum total of the time of all the\nactivities ( 20 + 60 + 40 + 30 + 20 + 10) combined.\n\n\nThus, if one worker does all the activities, he can complete one\nunit in 180 seconds or three ( 3) minutes.\n\n\nThis is equivalent to 20 units per hour or 160 units per day.\n\n\nIn this example, with 6 workers, 6 x 160 = 960 units can be\ncompleted in one day. \n\n \n\nb.   Capacity of the line   .\n\n\nThe simulated capacity of this line is 16 units for the first 1000\nseconds, equal to 63 seconds/unit.\n\n\nLonger simulation will approach the limit of 60 seconds per unit.\n\n\nThis is nothing but the capacity of the slowest section, which is B,\nthe \" bottleneck &rdquo; operation.\n\n\nThis capacity can also be interpreted as 1 unit per minute or 60\nunits per hour.\n\n\nWith eight hours a day, the whole line of 6 workers can complete 480\nunits per day.\n\n\nThis is half of what can be done if they worked separately! \n\n \n\nc.   Idle capacity   .\n\n\nIt is expected that the idle time for each of the activities is as\nfollows: \n\n \n\nThus, in a day, 1440 minutes ( equivalent to 3 workers) are\nunproductive!", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "4863a469-b67f-43df-992d-409f62359c0a", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.206452+00:00"}
{"text": "A Preliminary Study of the Performance of On-Off Control in\na Batch Reactor  \n\n\n Leonila C. Abella and Armando T. Quintain \n\n \n\n This study aims to verify the performance of ON-OFF control\nin an agitated batch reactor and to determine the effect of temperature on\nits reaction rate.\n\n\nThe reactive system studied is Calcium Hydroxide ( Ca(OH)  2  )\nwith Sulfuric Acid ( H  2  SO  4  ) .\n\n\nThe temperature of the system is controlled using an ON-OFF mode of\ncontrol.\n\n\nThe concentration of the reactants are 0.05M, 0.10M, and 0.20M at\nreaction temperature of 40&degree;C, 50&degree;C and 60&degree;C. \n\n \n\nThe temperature of the system was controlled by the flow of the\nhot water entering the jacket of the batch reactor using a solenoid valve.\n\n\nWhen the temperature of the reactive system deviates from the desired\ntemperature, the controller sends a signal to the valve.\n\n\nThen, the solenoid valve turns ON if the temperature of the reactive\nsystem is lower than the desired temperature and it turns OFF if the\ntemperature is higher.  \n\n \n\nThe use of computers in control systems can be traced back to the\nearly fifties, that is the application in missile and aircraft control.\n\n\nSince mid-fifties, computers have been used in industrial process\ncontrol which is marked by the design and implementation of the computer\ncontrolled system of polymerization units  . \n\n \n\nToday, chemical engineers have approach studies on reaction\nkinetics focusing on the factors affecting the rates of reaction.\n\n\nTo attain a more favorable result, the process which a system\nundergoes must be controlled.\n\n\nProcesses may be controlled to give uniform and higher quality\nproducts by the application of automatic control.\n\n\nAlso, processes which respond too rapidly to be controlled by human\noperator can be controlled automatically.\n\n\nThis results to a better quality of products.\n\n\nThis therefore would increase productivity and lower production cost.\n\n\nIn this study, the temperature of the system is controlled using an\nON-OFF mode of control. \n\n \n\nThe ON-OFF control mode is frequently used due to its simplicity\nand low cost.\n\n\nIt is sometimes called the \" \" Two-Position Control\n&rdquo; \" or \" \" Bang-bang &rdquo; system \"\nand as the name implies, the output signal is only two, either zero or 100% (\n4).\n\n\nWhen the measured variable is above the set point, the output signal\nis zero and when the measured variable is below the set point, the output\nsignal is at its maximum value.\n\n\nThe output signal will serve as an actuator to the valve and the\nvalve will position either fully open or completely closed. \n\n\n  OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY:  \n\n \n\nThe main objective of this research project is to study the\nperformance of ON-OFF control in an agitated batch reactor.\n\n\nThe effect of the temperature on the rate of reaction, which is\nCalcium Hydroxide ( Ca(OH)  2  ) with Sulfuric Acid ( H  2 \nSO  4  ) , was also determined. \n\n\n  THEORY  \n\n\n  SOLENOID VALVE  \n\n \n\nA solenoid valve is composed of an armature, solenoid coil and a\nvalve.\n\n\nIn the absence of current through the solenoid coil, there will be no\nmagnetic field to pull the armature up, so the compression spring will push\nthe armature down.\n\n\nThe valve stem which is attached to the armature, pushes the valve\nplug tight against the valve seat.\n\n\nWhen the solenoid coil is energized, a magnetic field is established\nwhich pulls the armature up.\n\n\nAs the armature moves up, it lifts the valve plug off the valve seat\nand opens the passageway from inlet to outlet.\n\n\nSolenoid valves are two-position devices, either ON or OFF.\n\n\nFigure 1 shows the cross-sectional view of a solenoid valve  . \n\n\n  ON-OFF CONTROL  \n\n \n\nTo maintain the desired temperature of the reaction, the system\nwas automatically controlled using an ON-OFF mode of control through a\ncomputer.\n\n\nA program written in Turbo C language converts the milli-voltage\nsignals of the thermocouple to their corresponding temperatures.\n\n\nThe program then compares the temperature with the desired\ntemperature.\n\n\nIf the temperature is less than the desired temperature, it sends\nsignal to the solenoid valve to turn it ON.\n\n\nOn the other hand, computer turns the valve OFF, when the temperature\nis higher than the desired set point. \n\n \n\nThe characteristics of ON-OFF control mode is shown in Figure 2\nwherein the actual temperature tends to oscillate around the set point.\n\n\nAn overshoot occurs in the positive direction and undershoot in the\nnegative direction.\n\n\nSince the process cannot respond instantly to the change in the valve\nposition, an overshoot occurs  .\n\n\nIf the temperature rises, the rate of heat input is greater than the\nrate of heat loss in the process.\n\n\nShutting off the control valve cannot lower the temperature instantly\nbecause there are still heat energy built up in and around the heating\ndevice.\n\n\nThis residual heat energy temporarily continues to raise the\ntemperature.\n\n\nThe same way happens when the temperature decreases.\n\n\nIn general, a quantity controlled by an ON-OFF system has a tendency\nto undershoot and overshoot the desired value. \n\n\n  METHODOLOGY  \n\n\n  Experimental Set-up  \n\n \n\nThe experimental set-up is shown in Figure 3.\n\n\nIt is composed of a reactor, a solenoid valve and a heater which are\nconnected by 1/2 inch galvanized iron pipe.\n\n\nThe design of the reactor is the same as that of the existing\nlaboratory scale non-isothermal CSTR of Olano, S. ( 1990).\n\n\nThis reactor is equipped with a motor on top where the propeller is\nconnected to.\n\n\nThe motor is also connected to the variac in order that the rate of\nagitation can be controlled.\n\n\nIn between the heater and the control valve, a by-pass is provided to\navoid an overload when the control valve is in its OFF position. \n\n\n  Experimental Procedure  \n\n \n\nPreliminary tests were conducted to determine the concentration\nof the reactants and the temperature ranges to be used in the\nexperimentation.\n\n\nThe concentrations were 0.05 M, 0.10 M and 0.20M while the\ntemperatures were 40&degree; , 50&degree; , and 60&degree;C.\n\n\nThe flowrate of hot water was 270m1/sec and the volume of the\nreactive system was 1000 ml and these were held constant. \n\n \n\nThe temperature of the reaction was first set to 40&degree; C\nusing 0.05 M concentration of the reactants.\n\n\nWater entering the jacket of the reaction was controlled by a\nsolenoid valve.\n\n\nThe reactants were then poured into the reactor at the same time the\ntemperature of the reactor was 2 to 3 degrees lower than that of the set\ntemperature.\n\n\nThe temperature readings from the computer and fluke thermometer were\nrecorded at an interval of one minute.\n\n\nSamples withdrawn were analyzed every two minutes to monitor the rate\nof reaction with time. \n\n \n\nThe Adsorption Indicator Method was employed in determining the\nrate of reaction.\n\n\nIn this method, the sample was filtered to separate the solid Ca(SO)\n 4  products from the solution.\n\n\nThe filtrate was analyzed for amounts of unreacted H  2  SO\n 4  after every two minutes by titrating it with BaCl  2  .\n\n\nThe volume of the filtrate was recorded before it was transferred to\nan Erlenmeyer 's flask which contains 1 ml of distilled water and 1 ml of\nmethanol.\n\n\nTwo drops of 0.2% of Alizarin Red S indicator was added which turned\nthe solution yellowish.\n\n\nThis change in color from transparent to yellowish proved the\npresence of sulfates, SO  4   - 2  .\n\n\nTitrating with BaCl  2  , the solution would eventually turn\nlight pink at its end point because of the formation of BaSO  4  .\n\n\nThen, the volume of the BaCl  2  used was recorded. \n\n \n\nThis procedure was repeated for concentrations of 0.05 M, 0.10 M\nand 0.20 M of the reactants at temperature of 40&degree; C, 50&degree; C, and\n60&degree; C. \n\n\n  RESULTS AND ANALYSIS  \n\n \n\nThe temperature readings through the use of the computer were\ncompared with the temperature readings through the use of a fluke\nthermometer.\n\n\nAt a set point of 40&degree;C, the comparison of the temperature\nreadings is shown in Figure 4a and 4b at different concentrations of 0.05 M\nand 0.20 M respectively.\n\n\nThe graphs show that there is a slight deviation between every\ntemperature reading obtained from the computer and the corresponding reading\nfrom the fluke thermometer.\n\n\nThis deviation can be attributed to the error caused by noise or\ndisturbances affecting thermocouple signals.\n\n\nThe same behavior was observed when the set point was 50&degree; C as\nshown in Figure 5.\n\n\nIncreasing the set point to 60&degree; C showed almost the same trend\nas shown in Figure 6.\n\n\nThe oscillation of the temperatures with reference to the desired\ntemperature clearly depicts the behavior of an ON-OFF control action.\n\n\nThe temperature readings oscillate from as low as 40.2&degree; C to\nas high as 41.8&degree; C with a differential gap of about 1.6&degree; C when\nthe set point was at 40&degree;C.\n\n\nLikewise, a differential gap of about 1.0&degree; C was observed when\nthe set point was at 50&degree; C and 1.8&degree; C when the set point was at\n60&degree;C.\n\n\nThe differential gap is common to all control systems using ON-OFF\nmode of control.\n\n\nThe same behavior was observed at different concentrations of the\nreactants. \n\n \n\nMean temperature readings through the use of the computer were\ncompared with the mean temperature readings through the use of the fluke\nthermometer.\n\n\nTwo approaches in the computation of mean were used ( i. e.\narithmetic mean and mean-value theorem).\n\n\nResults of comparison show that mean temperature readings for both\nfluke and computer has a relatively small deviation of about 1.0&degree; C as\nshown in Table 1. \n\n \n\nThe effect of temperature on the rate of reaction expressed in\npercentage sulfuric acid converted was determined.\n\n\nIt was observed that when the temperature was increased from\n40&degree; C to 60&degree; C, there was also an increase in the percentage\nconversion of sulfuric acid from 68% to 87% as shown in Figure 7.\n\n\nThe same trend was observed at different concentrations of the\nreactants. \n\n\n  CONCLUSIONS  \n\n \n\nON-OFF mode of control can effectively control to within\nreasonably prescribed limits of temperature variations of the system to the\ndesired temperature.\n\n\nIt is reasonable enough to conclude that temperatures oscillate at\nthe desired temperature, even though the system has a differential gap of\nabout 1.0&degree; C to 1.8&degree; C.\n\n\nIt was also found out that the rate of reaction increases with\ntemperature.   <subtext.2>\n\n\n\n\n  Present Level of Technology Utilized in Teaching and\nLearning in Philippine IHLs  \n\n\n\n Zelinna Cynthia Pablo \n\n \n\nIn the aspect of using Information Technology in teaching and\nlearning in IHLs, the Philippines is, on the whole, still at its infancy\nstage.\n\n\nLate in the last decade, a study of the status of technology in\neducation revealed that  \" [ gauging on educational software and\nhardware, as well as research inputs so far] it would seem we are way below\nthe technology required for quality education in the context of developed\ncountries\".  These observations are testimony to the fact that in so far\nas quality education and the new technologies are concerned, very much is to\nbe done in this direction  . &rdquo;  [ SUTA89]\n\n\nTo date, a number of key educational administrations uphold the same\nview. \n\n \n\nFor purposes of this study, it must be noted that this \"\n\" infancy stage &rdquo; \" has three implications:\n\n \n\nFirst, due to the relative \" newness &rdquo; of the call\nfor technology in education, statistical data remains unavailable, even at a\nnational level, with respect to the exact level of utilization of technology\nin IHLs.\n\n\nFor this reason, this paper deals with a focal system that is more\nmanageable, and for which data is obtainable.\n\n\nFor the most part, it focuses primarily on De La Salle University.\n\n\nEfforts of other institutions are mentioned sporadically. \n\n \n\nSecond, because of the \" \" infancy &rdquo; stage\n\" that IHLs are in, non-statistical information exchanges have\nrevealed that only a small number of IHLs are in a position to incorporate IT\ntools into their method of educational delivery. \n\n \n\nThird, due to the small number of IHLs ready to carry out\nincorporation, most efforts are channeled towards planning, and less on\nimplementation, for the use of technology in teaching and learning.\n\n\nHence, for chapters 4 and 5, the tone of the study will focus more\non  \" tools which we plan to use\"  ; limited discussion\nis devoted to  \" tools already in use.\"  \n\n \n\nAn overview of the technological scenario in the Philippine\nhigher learning sector reveals the following:\n\n\n- the country currently has a pool of 50,000 IT professionals\n\n\n- 50% of colleges and universities offer IT as a degree program, but\nthere is no data on how many use IT as a tool for educational delivery\n\n\n- 60% of the population is IT literate\n\n\n- there are an estimated 100,000 Internet users\n\n\n- 20 universities have web sites, along with 8 other (\nnon-university) educational institutions [ CABA97] \n\n \n\nHighlights of its current status on the use of technology in\nteaching and learning are as follows:\n\n \n\n 1  Unified top management planning for use of technology\nin education.  \n\n\nLong Term missions, goals, and objectives have been developed by top\nadministration, and have been documented ( in the form of the NITP).\n\n\nStrategic plans have been translated into operational goals (\nstrategies and action plans). \n\n \n\n 2.  Fragmented implementation of use of technology in\neducation   .\n\n\nImplementation efforts in support of the strategic plans mentioned\nin ( 1) are taking place on a per-institution basis, not through a\nsynchronized national effort.\n\n\nThe First National Workshop for IT in Education, an attempt to\nsynchronize efforts on a national level, was completed only in April of this\nyear.\n\n\nMajor institutions such as UP, Ateneo, and De La Salle adopt the\nnational vision of using IT in education, and incorporate global standards in\ngenerating their plans.\n\n\nHowever, inter-institutional coordination is minimal. \n\n \n\n 3.  Unavailability of scientific data   .\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, strategic statistical data on the level of\ntechnology use in teaching and learning is not available; the Department of\nScience and Technology has recently identified the need for such data, but\nefforts for its collection and analysis are still in the planning stage.\n\n\nAt present, information has been gathered through non-statistical\nmethods: that is, through interaction and exchange with administrators of\nselected institutions, primarily through the First IT-Ed Workshop.\n\n\nNo attempt has yet been made to determine a statistically sound\nsample.\n\n\n Because of this, the prescribed table has not been put into use\n . \n\n \n\n 4.  Pyramidal distribution of technology use   .\n\n\nBased on available data, the use of technology in teaching and\nlearning appears to be pyramidal in nature: i.e., it is estimated that a\nsmall number of IHLs ( the top tier of the pyramid) are  ready to\nincorporate  technology into the delivery of education.\n\n\nA smattering of faculty members may have already attempted to use\nthe technologies. \n\n \n\nDLSU is perceived to be one of the institutions which is ready\nto incorporate technology into teaching and learning, and it is this scenario\nthat is explored in depth in this study.\n\n\nThe bulk of IHLs ( the lower tiers), however, still support a\ndominantly traditional learning environment.\n\n\nIn fact, one issue that was discussed during the First IT-Ed\nWorkshop was the inequitable status of various educational institutions;\ni.e., was it right to plan for IT in education, given that certain\ninstitutions lacked basic resources such as chalk? \n\n \n\n 5.  Rake effect of technology use   .\n\n\nIHLs are not progressing towards greater technology used at a\nuniform rate.\n\n\nSome are far ahead; the bulk gets left behind.\n\n\nTechnology experts do not advocate a \" catch-up &rdquo;\nstrategy for this inequity in technological use and resources among IHLs.\n\n\nIn other words, more advanced institutions do not have to constrain\ntheir advancements for the sake of smaller institutions catching up.\n\n\nInstead, the \" \" rake effect &rdquo; \" ( some\nsegments moving forward, others getting left behind) is taken as a given, and\ntechnology use is expected to permeate from more advanced institutions to the\nless advanced ones.\n\n\nOne avenue for this would be the ESEP program, which allows masteral\nstudents from smaller institutions to fulfill their residency in larger ones,\nallowing for transfer of expertise. \n\n \n\n 6.  Inequity of technology use even among feeder schools\n  .\n\n\nThe inequity that prevails among IHLs is also felt among the primary\nand secondary schools that feed into IHLs.\n\n\nCertain institutions incorporate the use of computers and the\nInternet as early as Kindergarten; others do not.\n\n\nThis inequity may result in two possible mismatches for students\nupon reaching the IHL level: some students who have significant usage of\ntechnology in learning during their early years may find themselves in an IHL\nthat has minimal use of it.\n\n\nThe reverse may also be true.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "7f0ea140-6e6d-4feb-a99a-8cc3c919f7a8", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.207725+00:00"}
{"text": "Indigenous Knowledge on Postharvest Handling and\nUtilization of Philippine Highlands Yam  \n\n\n Violeta B. Salta \n\n\n  ABSTRACT  \n\n \n\nIndigenous yams of various species and cultivars abounding in the\nNorthern Philippines are generally important as subsistence and cash crops.\n\n\nNormally, yams are harvested at about 75% to 100% senescence depending\non its use and are handled manually with high postharvest losses.\n\n\nVillagers have unique ways of utilizing these yams into food.\n\n\nEach specie or cultivar has its own particular eating characteristics\nthat influence village users ' acceptance.\n\n\nThe postproduction practices and problems are then described\nindividually. \n\n \n\nUnedible yams in their fresh tuber state like \" \"\nnami &rdquo; \" (   Dioscorea hispida Dennst \n ) are processed indigenously to be edible.\n\n\nThese are done either by brine soaking and washing at varied number\nof days, roasting, adding vine extracts or alcoholic drink, or by using\n\" mother &rdquo; solution.\n\n\nA follow up study on these methods was done to evaluate their safety\nin the preparation for food and is reported separately.\n\n\nTo few people, processing fresh  nami  tubers is\nalso favored to clean rough hands and feet incurred from hard field work\nmaking them smooth.\n\n\nRoasted  \" nami, &rdquo;  on the other hand,\nis used to bait crabs ( crustacean) for food from the riverbanks. \n\n\n  INTRODUCTION  \n\n \n\nVarious crops as source of food nutrients are available in the\nPhilippines and these include root crops.\n\n\nRoot crops played a historic role as food and some have now gained\ninternational recognition.\n\n\nAmong these are potatoes, sweet potatoes, and cassava.\n\n\nLeft behind as minor root crops categorized as low priority\ncommodities ( PCARRD, 1992) are yams, aroids, yambeans, arrowroot and other\nedible root crops mainly because of their low production volume and\ncontribution to the national economy ( Villanueva, 1994).\n\n\nThese crops, however, are importantly utilized in most villages where\neconomic growth is slow.\n\n\nThe slow development of these crops could be due to several factors\nsuch as their physical and physiological characteristics as well as\ntraditional farming method, limited utilization technologies, knowledge about\nthe nature or properties of these crops that need to be further explored, and\nlack of government resources to put up facilities needed in the development\nof the crop. \n\n \n\nYam are mainly recognized as carbohydrate-producing crops ( Miege\nand Lyonga, 1982; Pido and Pepino, 1987); eaten as staple ( Nakagawa, 1970)\nimportant cash crop ( Gayao and Ganga, 1994); or supplement to rice (\nLacaden, 1993).\n\n\nThey are also used as ingredient or flavoring to special delicacies\nand ice cream making ( Giron, 1994).\n\n\nDemand for yams, in fact, is rapidly increasing because of the\nchanging eating pattern of the modern society but supply for preferred\nvarieties with purple flesh and good processing qualities is limited (\nVillanueva, 1994).\n\n\nOnly the \" \" Kinampay &rdquo; variety \" , as\ncalled in the southern Philippines or \" \" Sampero &rdquo;\n\" in the northern part is appreciated by yam processors to have the\nbest quality but yield is low and is highly susceptible to pests and diseases\n( Mariscal, 1994;).\n\n\nWhite yams, though of higher yield than purple ones ( Bartolini and\nGundaya, 1994), still have no commercial demand yet ( Villanueva, 1994).\n\n\nOn the other hand, the toxic properties ( i. e. diosgenin,\ndioscorine) of some wild species are extracted for pharmaceutical and poison\nuses ( Onwueme, 1981). \n\n \n\nSeveral studies were done on yams which include varietal\ncollection, yield evaluation, cultural management, postproduction, and some\non the nutritional compositions and starch properties ( Data  et al.\n , 1988).\n\n\nBut studies on the knowledge of village users ' point of view are\nstill lacking.\n\n\nAccording to Salazar ( 1994), the resources flourish with the help of\nfarmers who under specific agronomic and socio-economic conditions have been\nimproving on such resources through careful process of collection, selection,\nand cultivation for some couple of years.\n\n\nGathering information then on-site from the villagers/end users and\nevaluating their techniques could help or give researchers \" clue\n&rdquo; in developing varieties or products that are needed in this\nsophisticated world.\n\n\nThis concept could be supported by Prain and Bagalanon 's ( 1994)\nreport on local knowledge and global science, that  \" though\nmany species and varieties were discovered and well known in the official\nhistory, still this powerless nature of knowledge has made it invisible to\nglobal science or claimed to be unsystematic and incapable of meeting the\nproductivity needs of the modern world mainly because many of the small-scale\nmarginal agricultural systems where local genetic diversity is high and\nresources experimentation is common, has been little touched by the successes\nof the Green Revolution. &rdquo; \n\n\nThe authors stressed then the need to overcome isolation and identify\ncomplementarities if global agricultural science is to benefit marginal\nfarming households. \n\n \n\nThe aim of this study then was to identify existing yams, their\ncharacteristics, the places where they are found and importantly gather\nindigenous knowledge on the postharvest handling and utilization of these\nyams.\n\n\nIt is hoped that this simple endeavor would be useful to researchers\nand other people interested on indigenous yams to work more on the\ndevelopment of these potential crops. \n\n\n  METHODOLOGY  \n\n \n\nThe areas where the survey was conducted included provinces\ncovered by the three regions in the Northern Philippines, namely: Abra,\nBenguet, Ifugao, and Mountain Province of the Cordillera Administration\nRegion ( CAR); Ilocos Sur, La Union and Pangasinan of Region I; and Nueva\nVizcaya of Region II.\n\n\nIdentification of municipalities and barangays growing yam was based\non various secondary sources, notably the Department of Agriculture and\nBureau of Statistics.\n\n\nHistorical background of the yams were traced by asking the market\nvendors the source of their supply.  \n\n\nA set of guide topics/questions that focused on documenting farmers '\nyam cultivars and their postproduction techniques as well as problems was\nused.\n\n\nA total of 107 respondents involved in yams were interviewed:\nclassified as farmers, wholesalers, retails, processors, consumers, observers\nor combinations of these. \n\n \n\nThe survey included the cultivated and wild yams utilized as\nfood, animal feeds and other purposes.\n\n\nOther information from observers who volunteered during the interview\nwere also documented.\n\n\nThe survey started in December 1990 and was completed in December\n1992. \n\n\n  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  \n\n \n\n  Indigenous yams included in the study.  \n\n\nThe existing cultivated and wild yams as well as the places where\nthey are found are shown in Table 1.\n\n\nTheir local names are retained for purposes of further\ncharacterization later.\n\n\nThey, however, showed varied plant and tuber characteristics ( Table\n2) but same may be of the same species or cultivar suspected to be\nacclimatized to the environment where it was grown.\n\n\nThe basis of classification here was based on the descriptions of\nyams described by Onwueme ( 1981); Messiaen ( 1988); Miege and Lyonga (\n1982); Burkill ( 1960) and Purseglove ( 1968).\n\n\nSome characteristics which these yams have, however, were not\nobserved because visitation was done after harvest where the plants have\ndried up already making it difficult to identify.\n\n\nMoreover, villagers gave different names based on their local\nlanguage, either through tuber shape, color, or place where they came from.\n\n\nIt is therefore recommended to make a complete collection and\ncharacterize them accordingly using improved techniques such as isozyme\nanalysis. \n\n\n  CULTIVATED VARIETIES  \n\n \n\n  Local varieties.  \n\n\nYams are grown mostly on marginal lands either as monocrop, intercrop\nor mix crop to legumes, corn, upland rice, other root crops or ginger.\n\n\nThis system of multiple cropping is practiced by most farmers for\nvarious food supply.\n\n\nDue to unstable market prices, farmers take risks by planting\ndifferent kinds of crops to backup / compensate for low income return\nobtained in other crops.\n\n\nYams are grown on poles, under trees or tall shrubs.\n\n\nThe varieties mostly cultivated belong to the species of \n Dioscorea alata   ( otherwise known as \"\n ubi  \" ; greater yam) and   Dioscorea\nesculenta   .\n\n\nAmong these are \" \"  Sampero  , &rdquo;\n\" \" \"  Shiket  , &rdquo; \"\n\" \"  Padikot  , &rdquo; \" \"\n\"  Padinse  , &rdquo; \" \" \"\n Daking  , &rdquo; \" and \" \" \nTongkol  \" \" for the   D. alata\n  group and \" \"  Ilocano  ,\n&rdquo; \" \" \"  Diket  \"\n\" and \" \" Native  Tugue  \"\n\" for   D. esculenta   .\n\n\n\"  Sampero  \" is the most preferred\nvariety because of its high market demand but claimed by farmers to be highly\nsusceptible to disease and needs extra care and maintenance.\n\n\nThis variety has a round tuber shape, deep purple flesh, and strong\naroma preferred by processors; a set of characteristics similar to the\n\"  Kinampay  \" variety on the Southern part of\nPhilippines ( Villanueva, 1994).\n\n\nOther varieties mentioned above also have purple flesh and are used\nto supplement the low supply of \"  Sampero  \" but\nare less desirable due to poor aroma and tuber shapes.\n\n\nThe growing areas of yams are mostly in warmer areas of Benguet\nProvince; nearby boundaries like La Union, Pangasinan, in Dupax del Norte and\nKasibu of Nueva Vizcaya province. \n\n \n\nFor   Dioscorea esculenta   , common\nvarieties found in most of the areas visited are the \" \"\n Ilocano  \" \" and \" \" \nDiket  \" \" varieties.\n\n\nThe biggest volume of \"  Tugue  \"\nproduction, however, are obtained in Abra province of the CAR region; La\nUnion, Pangasinan, and Ilocos Sur provinces of Region I.\n\n\nThe \" \" Native &rdquo; type \" is an additional\nvariety found only in some parts of Benguet and nearby La Union.\n\n\nThe two former varieties are cylindrically elongated with white to\nyellow skin and flesh while the latter is somewhat round to round oval shape,\nbrownish skin and white flesh. \n\n \n\nAlthough yams grow in most of the areas, certain types of species\nand cultivars predominate in a particular area.\n\n\nThese species usually carried large number of local names or may be\ndifferent varieties carrying the same names.\n\n\nThus, a confusion in collecting information on the particular types\nof yams.\n\n\nWork on collection, identification and characterization of these\ndifferent species and cultivars will be done to resolve this confusion and\nmay further include yams from other places in the Philippines. \n\n \n\n  Harvesting practices.  \n\n\nHarvesting depends on the needs of the farmers whether the tubers are\nfor sale, home consumption or planting material.\n\n\nUsually, harvesting is done at 7 to 12 months ( November to March)\nmaturity.\n\n\nHarvesting is based on the calendar method, yield sampling or\nsenescence ( yellowing) of the plant.\n\n\nFor cash crop, yams are harvested when leaves are 75 to 85% senescent\nand for food, harvesting, could be done the same or later.\n\n\nSometimes, farmers sample the plants by carefully digging a few hills\nand see if the size is big enough and pinch the skin to determine the texture\nof the flesh.\n\n\nThey claimed that immature tubers are usually watery with loose\nstarch grains.\n\n\nAs planting material, farmers usually wait for the vines to dry up\nfor the tubers to fully mature.\n\n\nTubers store long when harvested at full maturity and believed to\nproduce higher yield when planted than immature ones. \n\n \n\nHarvesting is usually done on staggered basis, harvesting a\nvolume that could be eaten or disposed in a short period of time.\n\n\nIn the lowlands where \"  Tugue  \" are\nplanted in rice farms, harvesting is done on a row basis using a plow drawn\nby animals.\n\n\nIn the remote areas in Kapangan, Benguet, some farmers prime big\ntubers and leave the small ones to grow with the mother plant.\n\n\nHowever, when the production area is to be followed or prepared for\nthe next cropping, total harvesting is done. \n\n \n\nDelayed harvesting is also practiced to wait for higher market\nprice.\n\n\nGenerally, prices go up during special occasions such as Christmas,\nChinese New Year, and Holy Week seasons.\n\n\nOne or two weeks before these occasions, tubers are dug and brought\nto the market. \n\n \n\nAerial tubers that falls on ground ( formed on the axils of some\nyam vine plants) are replanted back nearby the dug area for the next harvest\nseason. \n\n \n\n  Handling practices.  \n\n\nContainers used for collecting and hauling are \"  lagba\n \" ( rattan-woven basket used in the lowlands, about 1 foot\nhigh and 2 feet wide), polypropylene sacks, and \"  kayabang\n \" ( field container used in Benguet carried at the back\nsupported with a head band).\n\n\nHandling practices depend on the places where yams are found or\ngrown.\n\n\nFarmers with access to good roads haul the produce from farm to\nroadside and may dispose them there to wholesalers or bring then to the\nnearest possible market for higher price.\n\n\nThese are transported by private vehicles or public transport for\ndistribution to neighboring places.\n\n\nIn most cases, these are handled together with other crops.\n\n\nFarmers in far-flung areas have to back-carry the produce for\nmarketing or may use them for home consumption. \n\n \n\n  Storage practices.  \n\n\nDue to limited produce and storage facilities, storing yam tubers for\nlonger period is not common to farmers.\n\n\nIt is practiced by few processors who purchase big volumes with\nenough space for storage.\n\n\nTubers are usually purchased from December to March and are stored\nin shelves or piled on floors.\n\n\nStorage period depends on the processing schedule which takes weeks\nor months to process a certain volume of tubers.\n\n\nHigh decay incidence during storage is one problem processors\nclaimed contributing to losses, and this needs immediate attention.\n\n\nThe possible reason for this high decay incidence could be traced to\nthe harvesting methods employed by farmers where yams are harvested early,\nabout 75 to 85% senescence and the rough handling of yams from farm to\nroadside to the market causing severe skinning and injuries to tubers.\n\n\nMoreover, containers such as polypropylene sacks are not firm and\nstrong to protect tubers from injuries during handling.\n\n\nDecay ( Onwueme, 1981) is caused by the effects of fungi and\nbacteria which could have entered through wounds.\n\n\nIt is suggested then that adequate protection should be ensured\nthroughout the distribution period to minimize crop loss. \n\n \n\nFor food, tubers are just placed in any corner of the kitchen\nand cooked as needed.\n\n\nStoring tubers may last for 1 to 2 weeks or more, often done to\nsweeten them.\n\n\nSweetened tubers have softer texture and good eating characteristics\nwhen cooked.\n\n\nSugars actually are present in fresh yam tubers in small quantity (\nOnwueme, 1981) and increases during or just before sprouting due to the\nconversion of starch to sugar.\n\n\nLeftover tubers for planting material are kept for about 1 to 3\nmonths depending on the availability of production area.\n\n\nThese are usually small sizes, or cut head portions of yam tubers\nleft aside for planting.\n\n\nThese cut portions are left for sometime at ambient condition to\ncure wounds naturally.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ebbfdbbd-fbd8-4660-94aa-7f9bfb85ef2d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.209260+00:00"}
{"text": "A Glimpse of Image Processing and Neural Networks \n\n\n\n Arnel Andres \n\n \n\n The author attended a course on image processing and neural\nnetworks, held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia from June 21-26, 1992, along with\nother ASEAN delegates involved in the AAECP ( ASEAN-Australian Economic\nCooperation Programme) project in Microelectronics.\n\n\nParticipation in this course, along with the ongoing theses projects\nof most graduate students in the College of Engineering, especially under the\nECE Department led to the conduct of this research paper.\n\n\nDiscussed in this paper are the underlying logorithms and mathematics\nin image processing and neural networks.\n\n\nSome of their major applications are mentioned in the conclusion.\n\n\nDetails on this subject will be dealt with in subsequent papers for\npublication.  \n\n\n  IMAGE PROCESSING  \n\n \n\nFirst on the list are enhancement image for user interaction and\nimage restoration.\n\n\nHere, images have to be digitized for further processing.\n\n\nThis implies that they are spatially quantized into pixels, and that\nthe grey value ( light intensity) is quantized into bits.\n\n\nThis can be based on a single input pixel ( point operation), a set\nof neighboring input pixels ( local or neighborhood operation) or on all\ninput pixels ( global operations). \n\n \n\nAfter the enhancement come segmentation of the image in objects\nand background followed by some logic processing.\n\n\nFor full color images, are usually constituted by red, green, and\nblue.\n\n\nLook up tables ( LUT) can be displayed by different display\nfunctions.\n\n\nThese involve linear and nonlinear operations.\n\n\nThese are computationally heavy ( e.g. Fourier Transform) and can be\navoided by implementing a series of local operations.\n\n\nOne local operation is point operation and is either defined by\nclassical arithmetic operations ( addition, multiplication, etc.) or by table\nlook up defining the output value for each input value.\n\n\nSuch tables can be based on image histograms.\n\n\nA linear time shift invariant filter is equivalent to the convolution\noperation.\n\n\nThis can be used for smoothing ( low pass filtering) and edge\nenhancement ( high pass filtering).\n\n\nThe important set of nonlinear filters can be described as data\ndependent filters.\n\n\nBeing close to edges, their behavior differs from those in more\nhomogenous areas.\n\n\nThe extreme percentile filters, the min-and-max-filters are important\nfor background estimation and may thereby be used for shading correction.\n\n\nA restored image ( no noise, no blurring, no shading) can be\nsegmented into objects and background by thresholding.\n\n\nImage statistics can be used for finding optimal threshold value.\n\n\nThe thresholding result is a binary image with just black and white (\n0/1) values.\n\n\nThe goal of binary image processing is to locate connected pixels (\nblobs or components), the most truthful representation of an object.\n\n\nHowever, the definition of connected pixels is not trivial.\n\n\nIt appears that they have to be different for object and background\npixels in order to avoid paradoxes.\n\n\nPixel operations involve simple arithmetic or logical combinations of\nzeros and ones.\n\n\nNeighborhood operations are usually based on a series of 3x3 windows,\nso 9-bit in, 1-bit out.\n\n\nThe elementary ones are dilation ( growing) and erosion ( shrinking).\n\n\nCombinations result in opening, closing and contour finding.\n\n\nBy setting conditions on the erosion, several types of skeleton\noperations result.\n\n\nA \" skeleton \" is a one-pixel thick object, located\nsomewhere in the middle of the original object which has the same topology (\nbranches and holes).\n\n\nA strict definition appears to be impossible, resulting in a set of\ndifferent solutions.\n\n\nA similar set of conditions on the dilation yields a background\nskeleton. \n\n \n\nThe \" propagation \" is a conditional dilation\nusing a mask image.\n\n\nIt is thereby a dyadic operation.\n\n\nIt can be used for removing image-edge connected objects, closing\nholes and retrieving objects for which some pixels are given.\n\n\nThe anchor skeleton is a conditional dyadic erosion that can be used\nby skeletonizing images part by part. \n\n\n  IMAGE ANALYSIS  \n\n \n\nDistances in images can be computed by counting pixel steps, only\nhorizontally and vertically ( city-block distance, 4- connected) or also\nvertically ( chess-board distance, 8- connected).\n\n\nBy weighing these two types of steps with 5 and 7, a pseudo-euclidean\ndistance measure is made.\n\n\nThis can be improved by also using the knight 's move step, weighed\nwith 11.\n\n\nUsing such a measure, the distance between object boundaries can be\ncomputed, or that between an object and a point or between two objects.\n\n\nThe computation has to be performed in a distance ordered way and can\nbe stopped as soon as the goal is reached. \n\n \n\nComputations in and on images are only truthful if the image is\nrestored correctly.\n\n\nSome discretization errors, however, can hardly be corrected, like\nmissing points or missing areas.\n\n\nAn important artifact is the aspect ratio introduced by many\ndigitizers related to the 4:3 field dimensions of the standard video sensors\nand monitors.\n\n\nThis influences all 3x3 filters and pixel weighing as well as all\ndistance computations.\n\n\nit is thereby advisable to use square pixel digitizers.\n\n\nThe spread in grey levels of objects and background may result in\ninaccurately computed object dimensions.\n\n\nMany object features are based on area and contour length estimates.\n\n\nThese are influenced by the square digitized grid for the length of\nstraight lines where closed contours correction terms are known.\n\n\nPosition estimates of the objects with known shape can be very\naccurate ( sub-pixel accuracy) if the object has non-straight edges.\n\n\nOtherwise the interference with the grid may cause a large\ninaccuracy.\n\n\nSeveral types of object features can be computed using a mix of the\nabove measures combined with edge detectors and histogram estimates. \n\n\n  OBJECT RECOGNITION  \n\n \n\nIf object models are given, artificial images can be studied\nusing graphical techniques that can be matched with the real observed image.\n\n\nThe best match out of a set of models yields a recognition.\n\n\nFor this approach, image analysis is not needed, but it is necessary\nto have knowledge on object position, light, sensor characteristics, etc., in\norder to generate realistic images.\n\n\nMoreover, the image generation and matching procedures can be\ncomputation heavy. \n\n \n\nThe second approach is the computation of a set of possible\nmodels out of the image analysis results.\n\n\nMatching is done in the model domain.\n\n\nWhile this type of match may be more simple, a combinatorial\nexplosion may result due to all possible object positions and orientation.\n\n\n \n\nA third possible approach is to extract characteristic\nmeasurements from both models and observed images.\n\n\nMatching retrieved feature vectors can be done quickly, but finding\nthe right features and matching measures can be a problem.\n\n\nIf no models are given, they may be learned from a set of examples.\n\n\nIn this learning stage, images have to be sensed, processed and\nanalyzed similarly as in the operational stage afterwards.\n\n\nFinding the right features, match measures and accuracy predictions\nare the goals of pattern recognition. \n\n\n  PATTERN RECOGNITION  \n\n \n\nPattern recognition starts with gathering a set of representative\nobject examples and possible features.\n\n\nIn the probabilistic approach, the optimal decision function for\nfuture objects is found by estimating the object class densities in the\nfeature space.\n\n\nObjects are optimally classified by assigning them to the class with\nthe highest a posterior probability--the Bayes method.\n\n\nAlternative approaches are the estimation of a minimum error decision\nboundary on the learning set and the \" nearest neighbor strategy\n\" .\n\n\nImplicitly, however, they are based on the same probabilistic\napproach: minimizing the expected classification error. \n\n \n\nAll pattern recognition techniques suffer from the curse of\ndimensions, also called the \" peaking phenomenon \" .\n\n\nFor large feature sizes ( and constant sample sizes as well), the\nclassification accuracy deteriorates due to a cumulation of estimation\nerrors.\n\n\nThis implies that the feature size k has to be small compared to the\nsample size ( e.g. k=n/10).\n\n\nThis phenomenon also holds more generally: from a certain point the\nclassification deteriorates if the decision boundary complexity ( linear,\nquadratic, etc.) or the density estimation complexity is increased further.\n\n\nThis implies that with increasing computational complexity, the\nfeature size has to be reduced.\n\n\nThe consequence for feature selection is that large feature sets have\nto be reduced by simple methods, that smaller feature sets can be reduced\nfurther by more complex methods, etc.\n\n\nIn feature selection one has to realize that the two best features (\naccording to individual ranking) are not the best two ( according to combined\nevaluation). \n\n \n\nSelection of features and classifiers has to be done by a\nlearning set.\n\n\nA testing set is needed for estimating the obtained classification\nresult.\n\n\nTogether the learning set and testing set constitute the design set.\n\n\nLarge learning sets produce better classifiers.\n\n\nA large testing set results in a more accurate error estimate.\n\n\nThe best compromise is the rotation method.\n\n\nThe design set is split up into a number of parts.\n\n\nOne part is taken apart and saved for testing.\n\n\nThe remaining part is used for learning.\n\n\nThis is repeated for all parts. \n\n \n\nEach time, a different part is used for testing and the remaining\npart for learning.\n\n\nFinally, all test results are averaged.\n\n\nIf a part is as small as one sample this is called the \" n-1\nor leave-one-out method \" .\n\n\nFor good classifiers, feature dependencies have to be taken into\naccount.\n\n\nHowever, this may necessitate the use of a large set of parameters.\n\n\nEspecially for large feature sizes, the Bayes model may thereby be\nunrealistic. \n\n \n\nOften, a restriction is made to linear classifiers.\n\n\nIn a Bayes optimal way the logistic model produces a linear decision\nfunction over a large set of class densities.\n\n\nHowever, there exists no analytical solution. \n\n \n\nThe Parzen method can be used if no knowledge is available on\nthe class densities.\n\n\nIt builds class density estimates out of elementary kernels,\npositioned on the learning set sample points.\n\n\nThe kernel width has to be optimized.\n\n\nParzen estimators can be simplified to a reduced set of kernels or\nto linear decision boundaries.\n\n\nThe simplest way of measuring the performance of a classifier or a\nfeature set is to count the errors.\n\n\nOther techniques are sometimes more feasible in relation to\noptimizing procedures, or give a more accurate estimate based on density\nmodel knowledge.\n\n\nModel weighed measures may be sensitive to  outliers  .\n\n\n \n\nOne model-free approach that is robust against large feature\nsets is the use of decision trees.\n\n\nHere, the feature selection is combined with the construction of\nclassifiers.\n\n\nAt each node of the tree a feature has to be chosen and a threshold\nhas to be estimated.\n\n\nIf no two objects in the learning set each learning set can finally\nbe classified completely correct.\n\n\nThis is obviously not optimal: the tree is too large ( compare the\npeaking phenomenon).\n\n\nSo smaller trees have to be constructed by either stopping rules, or\nby tree pruning. \n\n\n  NEURAL NETWORKS  \n\n \n\nNeural Networks were studied intensively as early as the 1960s.\n\n\nDuring that time, they were built up by linear threshold units (\nLTU).\n\n\nIf error counting is used for the performance measure, optimization\nproblems are encountered.\n\n\nTherefore, more smoothed functions are used ( e.g. the logistic\nfunction), often combined with squaring the errors.\n\n\nOptimization is often done sequentially for the learning objects.\n\n\nThe famous \" perceptron \" has a piece-wise linear\nweight function.\n\n\nIf the classes are linear separable, the perceptron learning rule\nalways converges to the optimal result.\n\n\nMany other rules have been studied for the non-separable case.\n\n\nThe problem is that in practice, it is not known whether the\nlearning set is separable or not, so the optimal learning strategy cannot be\nchosen.\n\n\nAnother important reason why the perceptron learning strategy has\nnot been used was the theorem by Minsky and Papert showing one of the\nimpossibilities of linear classification.\n\n\nAlso, multi-layer perceptrons and other cascaded classifiers have\nbeen studied.\n\n\nThey appeared to be either of limited use, or no satisfactory\ntraining algorithm could be found.\n\n\nNielson showed one way in which a two-layer perceptron of sufficient\nsize could separate any learning set perfectly. \n\n \n\nHowever, again, the generalization of such a solution is poor.\n\n\nFor these reasons, around 1970 the study of multi-layer perceptrons\nwas almost abandoned.\n\n\nAround 1985, a new wave of interest arose.\n\n\nPeople again realized the possible power of multi-layer machines and\ntheir resemblance to the human neural system.\n\n\nThe elementary processing unit, the artificial neuron, was redefined\nand a successful training algorithm was found.\n\n\nThis algorithm was not feasible earlier due to the very long\ntraining time it required.\n\n\nTraining results show a very specific character and depend on\ninitial values of parameters or weights.\n\n\nMoreover, special care has to be taken in order to avoid undesired\nrelative minima.\n\n\nIn order to speed up the process or improve the denumerability of\nthe results, special strategies are developed.\n\n\nThe point at which training should be stopped is obvious.\n\n\nOvertraining ( deteriorating results) should be avoided.\n\n\nOn the whole, training neural networks is still an art. \n\n \n\nNevertheless, the literature shows a number of fascinating\nresults that seem to conflict with the large number of parameters that have\nto be set ( see \" peaking phenomenon \" ) .\n\n\nHow this is possible is still a subject of research.\n\n\nAnyway, the neural net seems to be a very interesting step to the\n\" \" universal learning machine &rdquo; \" .", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "Air Pollution Study in Metro Manila  \n\n\n Susan Gallardo \n\n \n\n Men have always regarded air as a source on life.\n\n\nHowever, they have continued to use it as a space to discharge solid,\nliquid and gaseous materials.\n\n\nMen have remained even ignorant to the fact that pollutants added to\nthe air are reactants in reactions which are taking place in our atmosphere.\n\n\nAcid rainfall, global climatic effects, lead particles, photo chemical\nsmog and other known problems are the legacy of not keeping our atmosphere\nclean.\n\n\nThese have led to ever-increasing health, aesthetic and economic\neffects. \n\n \n\nThis paper discusses the condition of our atmosphere in\nMetropolitan Manila.\n\n\nIn doing this, proper control of air pollution and effective\nmanagement of our atmosphere can be properly implemented.  \n\n\n  COMPOSITION OF OUR ATMOSPHERE  \n\n \n\nFirst, let us look at what we normally expect to find in our\natmosphere and what substances introduced by men alter the air composition.\n\n\n \n\nThe troposphere, the region of the atmosphere of great concern in\nthis paper, is normally composed of nitrogen, oxygen and other gases, as\nshown in Table 1. \n\n \n\nAnother component of air is water vapor, which is about 1 to 3\nper cent by volume.\n\n\nHowever, other gases are added to the atmosphere locally, due to\nnatural processes.\n\n\nOne example is volcanic eruption.\n\n\nThe recent eruptions of Mt. Pinatubo have greatly affected our air\ncomposition.\n\n\nHydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids as well as large quantities of\nthe oxides of sulfur have been emitted.\n\n\nThey also added a great deal of dust and particulate matter like ash.\n\n\nThese eruptions have not only affected us but other countries as\nwell.\n\n\nTherefore, the effect is global in nature. \n\n\n  TYPES OF POLLUTANTS: SOURCES AND EFFECTS  \n\n \n\nLiterally, any substance not normally present in the air, or\nmeasured in greater than normal concentrations, are considered to be air\ncontaminants.\n\n\nHowever, a substance is usually not labeled as such until its\npresence and concentration produce or contribute to the production of some\ndeleterious effect ( Danielson 1973).\n\n\nCO2 is not considered a pollutant as it is a material component of\nthe atmosphere and takes part in no significant chemical reactions.\n\n\nHowever, it is not natural to have it present in ever-increasing\nconcentration which is now affecting us globally.\n\n\nIt is formed by oxidation and combustion processes both natural and\nmanmade.\n\n\nIn 1860, CO2 was measured to be 292 ppm, in 1950, 310 ppm, and by\n1970, 375 ppm.\n\n\nThese data were taken at the Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii ( Pryde\n1973).\n\n\nTo date, CO2 concentrations have increased by nearly 25% since\nindustrialization ( Vargas 1989).\n\n\nThe result of the increased CO2 content is an increase in the earth 's\nmean temperature with even more deleterious effects such as rising water\nlevels along coasts and rivers.\n\n\nThis also can change precipitation patterns.\n\n\nThis is why CO2 is called a greenhouse gas.\n\n\nThe glass roof of a greenhouse allows shortwave light energy to pass\nthrough the inside but does not allow heat energy to escape to the outside,\nwhich keeps the inside temperature higher than the outside temperature.\n\n\nCO2 in our atmosphere has a similar effect-CO2 molecules absorb heat\nenergy and prevent its passage into spaces from the lower atmosphere. \n\n \n\nCarbon monoxide is derived in urban areas from automobiles.\n\n\nTransportation may account for over 90% in weight of all CO in the\nair in large cities, especially if little heavy industry is involved. \n\n \n\nCO has a bad effect on health.\n\n\nIt passes through the lungs directly into the blood stream.\n\n\nIt has a toxic effect caused by the affinity of hemoglobin in the\nblood to CO molecules.\n\n\nHemoglobin functions to carry oxygen from the lungs to the body\ntissue.\n\n\nSince CO combines with hemoglobin strongly, it prevents the carrying\nof oxygen.\n\n\nIt is easy, therefore, to understand why congested traffic can lead\nto headaches and dizziness. \n\n \n\nSulfur Oxides are primarily SO  2  and SO  3  .\n\n\nThey are derived mostly from stationary sources like power plants and\nindustries, by burning of fossil fuels.\n\n\nSulfur oxides in the atmosphere produce deleterious effects on\nvegetation, materials, and men.\n\n\nLeaves of affected plants showed a splotchy bleaching pattern.\n\n\nAlso, SO  2  dissolves to form H  2  SO < sb> 3\n and SO  3  to form H  2  SO  4  .\n\n\nThese suspended acids are washed out during the first rain and causes\nacid rains.\n\n\nAcid rains can corrode metals, and attack nylon and other fabrics.\n\n\nThey also affect plants.\n\n\nLimestone and marble are also susceptible to acid attacks.\n\n\nSO  2  acts as an irritant and is known to increase symptoms\nin patients with bronchitis, emphysema and other lung diseases. \n\n \n\nHydrocarbons are mostly derived from incomplete combustion or\npartial oxidation of fuel in motor vehicles in urban areas.\n\n\nForest and vegetation also emit various HC in their normal biological\nprocesses--for example, bacterial decomposition of organic matter produces\nmethane gas.\n\n\nMan also emits HC into the atmosphere by allowing the evaporation of\nindustrial solvents and the processing and usage of petroleum.\n\n\nBecause of the wide variety of HC emitted, it is difficult to\ngeneralize their effects.\n\n\nHowever, reactive HC plays an important part in smog formation.\n\n\nAlso, certain HC like benzo-a-pyrene has been linked to cancer. \n\n \n\nParticulates are complex acids and liquids found in our\natmosphere.\n\n\nThey enter the atmosphere through natural emissions like volcanic\neruptions or through man-made processes in industries like grinding and\nspraying, fly ash from combustion processes and from automobiles.\n\n\nOf all the toxic metals found in the air, lead is present in the\nbiggest concentration.\n\n\nIt comes from the burning of gasoline where it is added as an\nanti-knock agent. \n\n \n\nOxides of nitrogen, generally referred to as Nox, are generated\nmainly by automobiles and electric power plants.\n\n\nThe most significant environmental effect of Nox emission is its role\nin smog formation.\n\n\nNitrogen dioxides and nitric oxide are known to cause fading in\nacetate, cotton and rayon fibers.\n\n\nThe yellowing of white fabrics has been shown to occur in the\npresence of Nox.\n\n\nNitric oxide is not an irritant, and its main toxic potential results\nfrom its oxidation to NO  2  .\n\n\nNitrogen dioxide is an irritant to the eyes and the respiratory\ntract. \n\n \n\nIn Table 2, five major pollutants are identified.\n\n\nThey are carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, hydrocarbons, particulates,\nand nitrogen oxides. \n\n \n\nLastly, the total effect in terms of health, aesthetics and\neconomic damage of the pollutants that enter the air is greater than the sum\nof all the gaseous, liquid or solid pollutants.\n\n\nThe troposphere acts as a large reaction vessel in which a complex\nseries of chemical reactions takes place, aided by the energy of the sun.\n\n\nThis interaction of hydrocarbons, oxide of nitrogen and oxygen in the\npresence of the sun 's ultraviolet light produces photochemical smog, which\nis an even greater problem in big cities. \n\n\n  AIR POLLUTION IN METRO MANILA  \n\n \n\nMetro Manila, which is the busiest and most thickly populated\npart of the Philippines, is not spared from the ever-growing problem of air\npollution.\n\n\nTable 3 shows the population of Metro Manila.\n\n\nThe existence of polluted air in Metro Manila is observed not only on\nthe busy streets but also in residential homes.\n\n\nDust normally settles all over the house.\n\n\nHousewives find it difficult to do the cleaning many times a day.\n\n\nWith the recent eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, not only is dust obvious\nbut abundant ash falls has caused many homeowners and building establishments\nto clear their roofs and yards. \n\n \n\nDuring rush hours, the city 's main streets look hazy from the\nemissions of poorly maintained motor vehicles.\n\n\nThese include not only  jeepneys  and buses but even\nprivately owned cars stalled in congested traffic.\n\n\nIt is also a common thing to see people covering their noses.\n\n\n Jeepneys  and bus drivers find that their towels\nbecome black due to smoke and dust. \n\n \n\nThe roofs of residential houses located near industrial\nestablishments are often replaced due to acid rainfall which causes metallic\ncorrosion.\n\n\nAll these and more are obvious causes for us to become aware of the\ncondition of our atmosphere and come up with proper monitoring systems and\ncontrol measures to keep the surrounding air clean. \n\n\n  SOURCES OF AIR CONTAMINANTS IN METRO MANILA  \n\n \n\nThe major sources of CO and hydrocarbons are motor vehicles.\n\n\nIn Metro Manila, the number of motor vehicles registered with the\nLand Transportation Office in 1990 increased by 16.41% over the 1989 total.\n\n\nOf the total 648,778 motor vehicles, 16% are new and 84% are renewed\nregistration.\n\n\nTable 4 shows the type of motor vehicles with new registration and\nrenewed registration. \n\n \n\nLTO data also shows that 73.4% of these vehicles are gasoline fed\nand 25.2% are diesel fed.\n\n\nTrailers are not fueled. \n\n \n\nTable 5 shows that gasoline fed vehicles contribute to CO and\ntotal organic gas emissions while diesel fed vehicles account for particulate\nmatter, SOx and NOx emission. \n\n \n\nOther sources of air pollution in Metro Manila are power plants\nand industrial firms.\n\n\nThey are called stationary sources.\n\n\nTable 6 gives an estimate of air pollution emission from stationary\nsources by area.\n\n\nFrom this table, Valenzuela is highly polluted, followed by\nPara&ntilde;aque.\n\n\nThis is so because most of the industrial firms and power plants are\nlocated in these areas. \n\n \n\nIt can also be seen in Table 7 that mobile sources account for\nmost PM, CO, NOx and TOG emissions, while electric generating plants are\nculprits for SOx emissions. \n\n\n  AIR QUALITY MONITORING IN METRO MANILA  \n\n \n\nDuring the past 15 years, air quality monitoring in Metro Manila\nhas been along major thoroughfares, so information or data gathered are\ntraffic-related situations.\n\n\nDuring the seventies, stations were established in Cubao, Quiapo,\nPasay and Ermita.\n\n\nIn 1985, some of these stations were abandoned and new ones using\ndifferent methods of sampling and analysis were established.\n\n\nThese are shown in Figure 1. \n\n \n\nIn order to protect public health and welfare and to reduce\nproperty damage, the NPCC set the following maximum limiting levels shown in\nTable 8.\n\n\nThe maximum air quality standards of other specific pollutants are\ngiven in Table 9. \n\n \n\nData gathered by the NPCC showed the effect of exhausts from\nmotor vehicles in the metropolis from 1975 to 1983.\n\n\nAdditional data were gathered from 1987 to 1990 at the different\nmonitoring stations.\n\n\nThese data are plotted in Figures 2 to 4 to show the level of air\npollution in Metro Manila. \n\n\n  AIR POLLUTION LEVELS IN METRO MANILA  \n\n 1.\n\n\n Carbon Monoxide: \n\n\nFigure 2 shows the Quiapo area to be most polluted among the 4\nmonitoring stations.\n\n\nThis is due to heavy traffic and congestion, since so much passenger\njeepneys and buses ply the area.\n\n\nAlso when traffic density reaches the point where vehicles\nrepeatedly stop and start, emissions increase sharply ( Brockris 1977). \n\n \n\nQuiapo is followed by the Ermita area, Cubao area, and lastly,\nby Pasay.\n\n\nThis trend is shown in the late seventies and early eighties due to\nbusiness activities in the locality.\n\n\nSince business establishments are found in these localities, traffic\ncongestion is naturally expected and causes high CO emissions. \n\n \n\nToday, CO concentration in these areas may have changed due to\nchanges in traffic conditions and business activities.\n\n\nBut the trend shows increasing CO levels in all areas.\n\n\nThis may be expected due to more vehicles which are not properly\nmaintained. \n\n \n\nThis is expected to be the same trend for TOG, PM, and NOx. \n\n 2.\n\n\n Sulfur Dioxide: \n\n\nFigures 3a and 3b show the trend of SO2 levels in different\nmonitoring stations in Metro Manila.\n\n\nFrom 1981 to 1983, unreliable readings were expected due to a\ngradual breakdown of equipment ( DENR).\n\n\nBy 1986, the measurement method was changed from acidimetry to\ncolorimetric, resulting in lower SO2 levels measured. \n\n \n\nAll levels measured are below the standard of 0.14 ppm.\n\n\nIn areas like Ermita and Quezon City, SO2 levels are decreasing, but\nin areas like Valenzuela, Para&ntilde;aque and Pasig, the level of SO2 is\nincreasing.\n\n\nThese areas are places where power plants and many industrial\nestablishments are found. \n\n 3.\n\n\n Total Suspended Particulates: \n\n\nTSP levels in all areas exceeded 180 ug/scm, which is the standard,\nas shown in Figures 4a and 4b.\n\n\nPasig, Ermita, Malabon, Valenzuela and Quezon City are the worst\nareas in terms of TSP.\n\n \n\nTable 10 gives us the 1987 annual arithmetic mean of hourly\naverage concentrations of various pollutants in Metro Manila in\nmicrograms/m3. \n\n \n\nAs shown in Table 10, Valenzuela has the highest concentration\nof lead, followed by Malabon.\n\n\nQuezon City has the highest copper concentration followed by Pasig.\n\n\nIron and zinc are the highest in Pasay and Ermita.\n\n\nBased on these quantities, high levels of heavy metals are found in\nat least two stations: Valenzuela and Malabon.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "A DSP-Based Solution to the Early Identification of Hearing\nImpairment  \n\n\n Vincent Peter C. Valentus \n\n\n  ABSTRACT  \n\n \n\nThis paper describes the development of a low cost DSP solution\nfor the early identification of hearing impairment.\n\n\nThe desire is to develop a cost-effective, highly sensitive, and\neasily administered screening system for the evaluation of human hearing\nacuity. \n\n \n\nThe proposed system is called \" EARTEST \" .\n\n\n\" EARTEST \" is basically a DSP-based screening\naudiometer capable of performing pure tone air conduction testing. \n\n\n  INTRODUCTION  \n\n \n\nThere is a clear need for the early identification of hearing\nimpairment in infants and children.\n\n\nStudies have shown that reduced hearing acuity during infancy and\nearly childhood interferes with the development of speech and language skills\nof the child, which if not immediately detected and if no appropriate\nintervention has been done, could cause adverse effects on the child 's\nsocial, emotional, cognitive and academic development, as well as, on the\nperson 's vocational and economic potential  . \n\n \n\nAlthough methods exist that allow universal screening of\nhearing-impaired infants  , still it must be recognized that\nnot all hearing impairments will be present and can be detected at birth.\n\n\nA significant number of them will develop hearing impairment during\ntheir early years.\n\n\nSuch losses may be acquired as a result of medical conditions or of\nhereditary causes.\n\n\nSince new cases of hearing impairment can arise in early childhood,\nadditional screening methods should be executed.\n\n\nAs a practical matter, however, the cost of universal screening has\nbeen prohibitive, the biggest part of the problem being the huge expense that\nwill be spent in operating a universal screening system.\n\n\nAnother issue is the manageability of administering such testings at\nthis large extent.\n\n\nFor a universal screening procedure to be feasible, this should be\nfast, reliable and easily administered by trained individuals. \n\n \n\nOn these accounts, we proposed a system called \" EARTEST\n\" for the early detection of hearing impairment in children.\n\n\nThe system is a DSP-based screening audiometer capable of performing\npure tone air-conduction testing.\n\n\nNote that the system is intended only for screening children who\nexhibit difficulty of hearing.\n\n\nAs such, the system could not provide accurate prognosis of the\npatient 's hearing problems.\n\n\nHowever, results of the test provides sufficient information for the\nconducting specialist to recommend whether or not a patient needs to undergo\na more thorough audiologic evaluation.\n\n\nAn advantage of the system is that it interfaces to any\nIBM-compatible PC.\n\n\nA graphical user interface is provided that allows the user of the\nsystem to easily control the conduct of the audiologic examination.\n\n\nMoreover, a database system that handles records of patient\naudiograms is included in the system which allows important statistical data,\ne. g., mean level of hearing acuity pertaining to a certain locality or\npopulation, to be easily generated. \n\n\n  SYSTEM OVERVIEW  \n\n \n\nPure tone audiometry is the standard measure of hearing acuity.\n\n\nA complete pure tone audiometry includes both air conduction and bone\nconduction testing.\n\n\nAir conduction testing evaluates the patient 's sensitivity to pure\ntones via hearing from the auricle to the cochlea.\n\n\nBone conduction testing, on the other hand, evaluates hearing acuity\nby direct stimulation of the cochlea through a bone oscillator placed on the\npatient 's mastoid or forehead.\n\n\nTesting by both air conduction and bone conduction provides an\nindication of how much of a hearing loss is due to the transmission or\nconduction of sound and how much is due to inner ear or nerve damage  . \n\n \n\nIdeally, a screening audiometer should include both air\nconduction and bone conduction testings.\n\n\nHowever, cost constraints limit us to design the system for air\nconduction testing alone.\n\n\nAlthough air conduction testing by itself will not provide enough\ninformation to determine the patent 's exact hearing condition, its test\nresults will suffice for a specialist to note if a patient needs to be\nreferred for a more thorough audiologic evaluation. \n\n \n\nAir conduction testing involves the playing of pure tones of\nvarying degrees of intensity levels on one of the patient 's ear to determine\nhis/her threshold hearing level across selected frequencies in the audible\nsound spectrum.\n\n\nThe generation of a pure tone is done digitally using a TMS320C10\ndigital signal processor.\n\n\nThe algorithm used is the linear interpolation table-lookup method of\nsine wave generation. \n\n \n\nSometimes, it is necessary to introduce masking noise to the\npatient 's non-test ear to prevent it from participating in the test of the\nother ear.\n\n\nThis is necessary due to the occurrence of cross-over - - a condition\nin which sound introduced to the other ear may be perceived by the other ear\nsince sound can travel from one side of the head to the other.\n\n\nMasking the patient 's non-test ear is usually done when performing\nbone conduction testing.\n\n\nNonetheless, this feature is included in the design of the EARTEST\nsystem.\n\n\nA pseudo-random bit sequence generator algorithm is assembled for the\nTMS320C10 processor to simulate the random noise source. \n\n \n\nEARTEST has a software interface program, which runs on Windows\n3.1 ( see Figure 1), that controls the operation of the hardware.\n\n\nThe hardware and software modules communicate through the PC 's\nparallel port.\n\n\nUsing this software, the person that conducts the examination will be\nable to change the frequency of the test tone, vary its intensity, and modify\nhow the tone is played ( i.e., continuous or interrupted play).\n\n\nIt can also select whether masking is enabled on one ear and change\nwhere the test tone is played (  i.e.  , right or left\near).\n\n\nIt has a plotting function for displaying the patient audiograms\non-screen, as well as, a database system that manages the collection and\nretrieval of patient audiogram records.\n\n\nA block diagram of the EARTEST system is shown in Figure 2:  \n\n\n  SINE WAVE GENERATION ALGORITHM  \n\n \n\nPure tone used for testing is digitally generated using the\nTMS320C10 digital signal processor.\n\n\nThe algorithm implemented to synthesize precise pure tones is the\nlinear interpolation table-lookup method  .\n\n\nThe implementation of the routine is based on a 256-point sine and\nslope tables.\n\n\nEach time this routine is called, the next sample point is evaluated\nand written to one of the selected digital-to-analog ports in the EARTEST\nboard for conversion to the desired continuous waveform. \n\n \n\nThe values in the sine table are all scaled and represented in\nQ14 format.\n\n\nIn Q14 format the decimal values, +1.0 and - 1.0, are represented by\nthe two 's complement hexadecimal values 4000 and C000, respectively.\n\n\nAll the other values are scaled and rounded to the nearest\nhexadecimal number to reduce signal distortion. \n\n \n\nThe linear interpolation method is an enhancement of the\ntable-lookup method of sine wave generation.\n\n\nJust as in the table lookup algorithm, a sine wave is generated by\nsuccessively accessing the sine table at a constant rate, wrapping around at\nthe end of the table whenever 360 angle is exceeded.\n\n\nThe table index is used as the angle parameter, denoted by ALPHA.\n\n\nALPHA is regarded as having an integer and fractional part with the\nformat:  \n\n \n\nDELTA denotes the step size for this routine and has the same\nformat as ALPHA.\n\n\nEvery time this routine is called, the contents of DELTA is added to\nthe contents of ALPHA.\n\n\nThe integer pointer of ALPHA is the pointer to the sine table.\n\n\nSample points falling between samples in the table are evaluated\nusing the linear approximation formula given by:  \n\n \n\nThe method of calculating the stepsize, DELTA, for a given\nsampling interval, t, and frequency can be obtained using the equation:  \n\n \n\nAt a sampling rate of 32768 Hz, the frequency resolution of the\nsine waveform generated is \n\n \n\nA flowchart of the table-lookup method of sine generation with\nlinear interpolation is shown in Figure 3.  \n\n\n  NOISE GENERATION ALGORITHM  \n\n \n\nMasking noise is also digitally generated using the TMS320C10\nprocessor.\n\n\nA pseudorandom bit sequence generator algorithm  is\nused to simulate the digital noise source which is then passed through a band\nlimiter to obtain the desired analog noise waveform.\n\n\nThe PRBS algorithm is described by the logic circuitry in Figure 4.\n\n\n \n\nThe maximum length of the sequence that will be generated by a\n31-bit register is K = 2  31  - 1, i.e., the number of binary\ncombinations of 31 bits minus the all zeros state.\n\n\nWith the 31-bit register clocked at 500 Khz, the cycle time ( time\nfor the sequence to repeat itself) would be over 1 hour.\n\n\nThe output spectrum generated by this filter consists of noise\nextending from the repeat frequency of the entire sequence, f  clock\n / K, up to the clock frequency and beyond.\n\n\nIt is flat within 0.1dB up to 12% of the clock frequency, dropping\nrapidly beyond its - 3dB point of 44%f  clock  .\n\n\nThus a low-pass filter with a high-frequency cut-off of 5%-10% of the\nclock frequency will convert the unfiltered shift register output to a\nbandlimited analog noise voltage. \n\n\n  DISCUSSION  \n\n \n\nThe cost of performing a screening procedure has always been a\nvery taxing and expensive endeavor because of the large number of testings\nthat need to be executed.\n\n\nFor a screening procedure to be feasible, it should be simple,\nlow-cost, highly-sensitive and readily implementable.\n\n\nThe EARTEST system we proposed for detecting hearing impairment seeks\nto satisfy these requirements. \n\n \n\nThe EARTEST system screens individuals who exhibit difficulty of\nhearing by testing for pure tone air conduction hearing.\n\n\nThis procedure is the usual first step for identifying hearing\nimpairments.\n\n\nIt provides a profile of the patient 's hearing acuity across the\naudible sound spectrum by eliciting feedback from the patients themselves.\n\n\nHence, the data that are generated can be considered highly sensitive\nof the patient 's hearing condition.\n\n\nPatient 's response to this test are usually immediate.\n\n\nA complete audiogram can be performed in roughly three minutes which\nis ideal if you want the screening procedure to cover a large number of\npatients in a short time period. \n\n \n\nThe EARTEST system is easy to use and is readily implementable.\n\n\nSetting up the system takes only two steps - - 1) install the\nsoftware interface program in the PC and 2) connect the accompanying hardware\nto the PC 's parallel port.\n\n\nThe layout of the software interface has been patterned after the\nfront panel of a commercial audiometer  so that the\naudiologist that would be using the system could easily get familiarized with\nits operation.\n\n\nThe GUI automatically performs system diagnostics so that if there\nare problems in the set-up, the user will be appropriately notified. \n\n \n\nThe EARTEST hardware component has been designed with cheap\nelectronic ICs and a low-cost digital signal processor.\n\n\nThis is done to lessen the cost of the system, without compromising\nthe precision of the test tones generated by the system.\n\n\nIt was designed to be as compact and as light as possible to bring to\nremote test sites. \n\n \n\nThe EARTEST system will be tested by a group of volunteer\naudiologists in one of the local schools in the country.\n\n\nThe system shall be evaluated on the ease of its use, sensitivity of\nthe system based on the number of misreferrals, and other points pertinent to\nthe conduct of the screening procedure. \n\n\n  CONCLUSION  \n\n \n\nA low-cost DSP-based solution for detecting hearing impairment\nhas been described.\n\n\nThe system is called \" EARTEST \" and is primarily\nused in performing pure tone air conduction hearing tests.\n\n\nThe system is presently being evaluated for its operability and\nfeasibility as a screening procedure for detecting hearing impairment.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "8c250bdc-603c-4bc6-97f1-cb33a5cacb58", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.213288+00:00"}

\n\nIn traditional computer networks, such as X.25 and TCP/IP\nnetworks, packets generally traverse the lowest cost route going from one\nsource to one destination.\n\n\nThe routing strategy has proven effective for services such as batch\nfile transfer and interactive remote login.\n\n\nIn recent years, new classes or computer and video services have\nemerged that transfer multiple copies of a packet from one source to many\ndestinations.\n\n\nApplications such as videoconferencing, parallel search of\ndistributed databases, multiple address email, and email distribution lists\ncan flood a computer network with multiple copies of a single packet that\nwill consume the capacity or the resources of the network.\n\n\nThis situation is similar to broadcasting or flooding algorithms.\n\n\n \n\nTransmission of a packet from one to many destinations is called\n\" multicasting [ COM, TANb], or multipoint routing, or multiple\ndestination routing ( MDR) [ TANa] \" .\n\n\nThe extreme case, where the packet is sent to all possible\ndestinations ( except the source), is called \" broadcasting\n\" .\n\n\nThe objective of routing strategies is to conserve network bandwidth\nor lower the cost of transmitting packets. \n\n \n\nIn networks with broadcast media such as IEEE 802.3 ( Ethernet)\nor VSAT networks broadcasting of packets is achieved by the normal operation\nof the medium.\n\n\nHowever, in networks with a mesh topology, broadcasting strategies\nhave to be deliberately defined.\n\n\nOtherwise, packets may loop or return to the sender.\n\n\nA popular choice is to route broadcast packets along a spanning tree.\n\n\n \n\nThis paper models the broadcast routing problem in a mesh\ncomputer network as a group theory problem with a cost function that has to\nbe minimized.\n\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to propose a new criterion for routing\nbroadcast packets if each node in the network may be a source of broadcast\npackets directed to the other nodes.\n\n\nConstraining broadcast packets to follow a single spanning tree, it\nwill be shown that a minimum diameter spanning tree is a suitable choice for\nrouting purposes.\n\n\nA heuristic for generating a minimum diameter spanning tree is\npresented. \n\n\n  SPANNING TREES  \n\n \n\nA network is modeled by a weighted non-directed graph consisting\nof nodes v and links 1  j  .\n\n\nFor the j-th link, a link weight w  j  represents some\ngeneral cost of transporting one packet across the link, such as physical\ndistance between nodes, average transmit time, time delay or economic cost.\n\n\nAlternatively, the link weight may be made inversely proportional to\nthe transmission capacity ( bandwidth) so that a higher weight implies a less\ndesirable link.\n\n\nFigure 1 shows an example of a network with link weights. \n\n \n\nA path from a source node to a destination node is a connected\nsequence of nodes and links in which no node appears more than once ( i. e.\nthat has no loops).\n\n\nThe weight or cost of the path is defined as the sum of weights w\n j  for the links l  i  in the path. \n\n \n\nThe shortest path between two nodes v  A  and v  B\n is that path that has the smallest path weight among all paths\nconnecting the two nodes.\n\n\nThe distance d(v  A  , v  B  ) between the two\nnodes is defined as the weight of the shortest path.\n\n\nThe shortest path, as well as the distance, are easily obtained with\nstandard graph theory algorithms such as Dijkstra 's algorithm [ DEO]. \n\n \n\nThe shortest paths from a given source node v  A  to all\nother nodes form a rooted spanning tree that we shall call a shortest path\ntree ( sometimes called a \" Dijkstra tree \" ) . \n\n \n\nAlternatively, routing algorithms can also use a minimum spanning\ntree ( MST) or shortest spanning tree, defined as the spanning tree having\nthe smallest weight.\n\n\n( The weight of a spanning tree is defined as the sum of the link\nweights of all the links in the tree.\n\n\n) The minimum spanning tree is constructed using either Prim 's\nalgorithm or Kruskal 's algorithm [ DEO]. \n\n \n\nGiven a mesh network such as Figure 1, a spanning tree can be\nchosen for purposes of routing broadcast packets from one node to the other\nnodes.\n\n\nRouting along a tree is simple and attractive since from any source\nnode there is exactly one path to every destination node.\n\n\nThe tree ensures that every destination will be reached, and that no\nloops will exist for packets to circulate.\n\n\nVarious broadcast strategies are discussed in [ TAN]. \n\n \n\nIn some protocols used by LAN bridges, nodes cooperate in\nhandling broadcast packets so that only one packet is sent along each link.\n\n\nWhen a node with two or more outgoing links receives a broadcast\npacket, it will forward one copy along each outgoing direction.\n\n\nWith this strategy, the total cost of routing packets from one source\nto all destinations is the tree weight. \n\n \n\n where the summation is taken over all links i in\nthe tree.\n\n\nClearly, the sum is minimized by routing packets along a minimum\nspanning tree. \n\n \n\nHowever, there are cases where a separate packet must be sent\nfrom the source to each destination.\n\n\nFor example, blind courtesy copies ( typically called \" bcc\n\" ) of email carry a different address in the mail header for each\ndestination, although the body of the mail will be identical for all copies.\n\n\nMass mailing, or mailing lists, also typically send one separate copy\nof mail for each addressee. \n\n \n\nIn this case, the cost of routing packets from one source node S\nis given by the total weight of all paths originating from S ( i.e. the total\ndistance of all nodes from S):  where the summation is taken\nover all nodes j.\n\n\nThe cost c(s, v  j  ) is the weight of the path taken by\npackets going from node S to node v  j  .\n\n\nThen, the lowest cost is obtained by routing along a shortest path\ntree rooted at node S so that c(S, v  j  ) = d(S, v  j  ) .\n\n\nSuch a tree can be constructed using Dijkstra 's algorithm to\nsimultaneously find the shortest paths to all nodes.\n\n\nFor example, the Open Shortest Path First ( OSPF) routing algorithm\nis based on Dijkstra tree [ PER]. \n\n \n\nWe observe that in general, the shortest spanning tree and the\nshortest path tree are different.\n\n\nThis is illustrated by Figure 2 for a source node S at the lower left\ncorner of the path.\n\n\nSecondly, we observe that there will be different shortest path trees\nfrom different source routes in the graph.\n\n\nFor example, if the tree in Figure 2(b) were used for the source at\nthe lower right node, the total distance of all nodes would be C = 34, which\nis obviously not the lowest possible cost. \n\n\n  BROADCASTING FROM MANY SOURCES  \n\n \n\nIn future applications envisioned for high speed networks, every\nnode can potentially be a source of broadcast packets.\n\n\nFor example, in future distributed databases, one way for a client to\nlocate data may be to broadcast a query to all databases servers.\n\n\n( The alternative is to query each database sequentially.) \n\n \n\nAssume that each destination is sent a separate copy of the\nbroadcast packet.\n\n\nSuppose that we would like the broadcast packets to traverse a single\ntree in order to simplify the routing.\n\n\nGiven a network graph with a mesh topology, the issue is how to pick\nthe best spanning tree for this purpose. \n\n \n\nIn a network in which each of N nodes can be a broadcast source,\nthe average cost per source of routing packets along a single tree is \n\n\nHere the distance d(v  i  , v  j  ) between source\nv  i  and the destination v  j  is taken as the weight of\nthe unique path along the tree. \n\n \n\nTherefore, the best spanning tree for routing broadcast packets\nis that which minimizes the cost criterion \n\n\nThis cost represents the sum of distances taken between all pairs of\nnodes in the spanning tree. \n\n \n\nIn this cost criterion, the i-th link contributes the link weight\nw  i  multiplied by the number of paths that traverse the link, when\npaths between all pairs of nodes are counted.\n\n\nConsider a representative tree shown in Figure 3.\n\n\nFor link i of this tree, the number of paths is equal to the product\nof the number of nodes on the left side of the link ( 3) and the number of\nnodes on the right side ( 6).\n\n\nThus, a total of 18 broadcast paths can pass through link i. \n\n \n\nFor link i of a tree, let N  iL  be the number of nodes\nto the left of the link, and N  iR  be the number of nodes to the\nright of the link.\n\n\nThen the cost ( Equation 3) can be expressed alternatively as  \n\n \n\nObserve that the more dissimilar the terms are, the smaller is\nthe product N  iL  N  iR  ( where the sum N  iL  +\nN  iR  = N, a constant).\n\n\nAs the terms become closer, the larger the product becomes.\n\n\nThus, this product N  iL  N  iR  is minimized by\nmaking one term equal to units and the other equal to N-1, if possible. \n\n \n\nBased on this consideration, the ideal spanning tree is a star (\nsee Figure 4).\n\n\nNotice that the distance between nodes in a star network are as short\nas possible, so that the cost ( 3) is also made smaller.\n\n\nHowever, it is not always possible to find a spanning tree with a\nstar topology.\n\n\nThen a two-level ( or multi-level) star such as that shown in Figure\n5 may be the best. \n\n \n\nIn networks with sparse connections, we cannot always hope to\nfind a spanning tree with a multi-level star topology.\n\n\nSo we come back to the question of constructing a spanning tree to\nminimize the cost criterion Equation 3 and Equation 4. \n\n\n  MINIMUM DIAMETER SPANNING TREE  \n\n \n\nGiven a network graph with a mesh topology, we would like to\nconstruct a spanning tree that minimizes the cost criterion Equation 3 or\nEquation 4.\n\n\nNote that this cost is the sum of distances taken between all pairs\nof nodes in the spanning tree.\n\n\nThus it makes sense to select a tree in which the longest path is as\nsmall as possible. \n\n \n\nWe define the diameter of a graph as the largest distance between\ntwo nodes [ DEO].\n\n\nIt follows that the diameter of a spanning tree is the longest path\nalong the tree. \n\n \n\nWe conjecture that a minimum diameter spanning tree minimizes, or\napproaches the minimum of, the cost ( 3).\n\n\nTherefore, we seek to construct a tree that achieves where the\nminimum is taken over all spanning trees of the graph.\n\n\nObserve that in a graph with a mesh topology, the minimum tree\ndiameter D  t  is lower bounded by the diameter of the graph D \ng  .\n\n\nFor suppose this were not true and the diameter of the spanning tree\nD  t  is less than the diameter of the graph D  g  .\n\n\nThen the largest distance between two nodes is D  t  and\nthis contradicts the assumption that the largest distance between two nodes\nin the graph is D  g  .\n\n\nOn the other hand, it is easy to produce examples for which the\nminimum tree diameter is larger than the graph diameter.\n\n\nA common example is a graph with ring topology ( \" ring &rdquo; or\n\" loop &rdquo; network). \n\n \n\nTo illustrate the above ideas, the graph in Figure 1 has a\ndiameter of 6.\n\n\nThe minimum diameter tree is shown in Figure 2a, with a cost of 116\ncomputed from either Equation ( 3) or Equation ( 4).\n\n\nThe shortest path tree in Figure 2b is inferior because its diameter\nis 10 and the cost by Equation 3 is 154. \n\n \n\nSince there are not many algorithms for finding the minimum\ndiameter tree in the literature we use the following heuristic:\n\n \n\n1. Find the shortest path between the two nodes that are\nfurthest apart in the graph, and call this the starting subtree.\n\n\nThat is, find the path that determines the diameter of the graph.\n\n\n( Intuitively, this seems to be a logical choice.\n\n\nSuppose the two nodes that are furthest apart are denoted by v \nl  and v  N  ; they are connected by a path having weight D\n g  .\n\n\nIf the path is not included in the minimum diameter tree, then for\nsure D  t  is strictly greater than D  g  .) \n\n \n\n2. For each node not in the starting subtree, connect the node\nto the starting subtree in such a way that the increase in tree diameter is\nminimized.\n\n\nIf there are several connecting paths that satisfy this condition,\nuse the one with the shortest path to the starting subtree. \n\n \n\nThis algorithm produced the spanning tree in Figure 2a. \n\n\n  CONCLUSION  \n\n \n\nThis paper has presented a new criterion for routing broadcast\npackets in a computer network if each node in the network may be a source of\nbroadcast packets directed to the other nodes.\n\n\nConstraining broadcast packets to follow a single spanning tree, it\nis shown that a minimum diameter spanning tree is a suitable choice for\nrouting purposes.\n\n\nA heuristic for generating a minimum diameter spanning tree is\npresented. \n\n \n\nThe discussion should motivate a search for good algorithms to\ngenerate minimum diameter spanning trees.\n\n\nThe heuristic algorithm presented can also be further investigated\nto determine how close its solutions are to the desired minimum diameter\ntree.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f4cdcba7-da97-41df-9684-882eecd14d67", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.214285+00:00"}
{"text": "A survey of distributed object-oriented programming\nlanguages and systems  \n\n\n Jonathan Dayao \n\n \n\n\" Distributed Object-Oriented Programming ( DOOP)\n\" is becoming a trend in the

do not claim the list to be exhaustive but it reflects the growing\ninterest in the field.\n\n\nAlso, this trend is evident not only in official standards\norganizations, such as ISO and CCITT, but also in industry consortia, such as\nthe Open Software Foundation and the Object Management Group in the US, and\nArchitecture Projects Management in the UK [ NICOL93]. \n\n \n\nThe goal of this paper is to identify current research in\ndistributed object-oriented programming.\n\n\nTo accomplish this general goal, we first identify the issues related\nto distributed object-oriented programming languages and systems.\n\n\nNext, we survey some of the most important implementations in this\narea using the issues identified as the basis.\n\n\nThe list of issues presented here may not be exhaustive, but, we hope\nthat it will give a general view of the areas that concern the application of\nthe object-oriented paradigm to programming distributed systems. \n\n \n\nWe hope to benefit from the survey by identifying the strategies\nused by different researchers, thus, identifying the \" \"\nstate-of-the-art &rdquo; \" in distributed object-oriented\nprogramming.\n\n\nAlso, this paper will assist in identifying research areas that can\nbe further investigated to realize environments that support distributed\nobject-oriented programming.\n\n\nLastly, this survey will serve as an overview of the field and so\nserve as a guide to researchers interested in this area. \n\n \n\nThe paper is organized as follows.\n\n\nSection 1.0 gives a definition of a distributed computing system.\n\n\nSection 2.0 provides our view of the object model.\n\n\nSections 1.0 and 2.0 are provided to determine the scope of the\nsurvey.\n\n\nBy defining distributed computing systems we have limited the number\nof programming languages in our survey to a manageable proportion.\n\n\nHowever, we do not find this restrictive and feel that our definition\nagrees with the other definitions found in the literature.\n\n\nOur definition of the object model allowed us to include different\ncomputational models that structure their problem domain as groups of\ncooperating

identified in section 3.0.\n\n\nIn section 5.0 we give some conclusions and section 6.0 illustrates\nsome further work. \n\n\n 1.0 Distributed Computing Systems \n\n \n\nWe adhere to the definition of \"  distributed\ncomputing systems  \" as systems that have several autonomous\nprocessors with local and unshared primary memory, and cooperate by passing\nmessages with the use of a communications network.\n\n\nWe share this definition with [ GOSCI91] and [ BAL89]. \n\n \n\nProcessors in a distributed computing system have independent\nprocessing flows and manipulate their own local data.\n\n\nProcessing happens in parallel among different processors and these\nprocesses may interact to accomplish a single goal.\n\n\nProcess interaction among processes in different processors is done\nby passing messages via a communications network.\n\n\nIt is also possible for each processor to have several processes\nrunning in true- or pseudoparallel.\n\n\nThese processes are scheduled by their local time-sharing kernel and\nmay cooperate using message passing or shared data. \n\n \n\nThere are parallel computer architectures with central control\nunits ( e.g., pipelined vector processors, SIMD - - single instruction\nmultiple data streams - - architectures, systolic architectures) and MIMD - -\nmultiple instruction multiple data streams - - architectures that cooperate\nusing shared memory [ DUNCA90].\n\n\nOur definition of distributed computing system is different from\nthese computer architectures because of the absence of central controllers\nand shared memory.\n\n\nOur definition categorically distinguishes itself as having\nautonomous processors, unshared memory, and process interaction through\nmessage passing.\n\n\nThis view is similar to Duncan 's definition of MIMD- distributed\nmemory architectures [ DUNCA90]. \n\n \n\nThe speed of the communications network may vary according to\nwhether the distributed computing system is  closely coupled  , \nloosely coupled  , or  very loosely coupled  .\n\n\n Closely coupled  distributed systems are characterized as\nthose with fast and reliable communications network.\n\n\nThe processors are physically close to each other and possible in a\n\" box. &rdquo;\n\n\nThe communication speed of these systems is in the order of\nmicroseconds. \n\n \n\nA  loosely coupled  distributed system has its\ncommunication speed in the order of milliseconds.\n\n\nThe communications network is not totally reliable because messages\nmay be damaged, delivered in the wrong order, or may not arrive at all.\n\n\nHigher level software must be designed and implemented to guarantee\nreliable communication.\n\n\nAn example of this is a workstation-LAN, where the local-area network\n( LAN) facilitates the communication among processes. \n\n \n\nIn  very loosely coupled  distributed systems, the\nprocessors are located geographically far and are connected by the use of a\nwide-area network ( WAN).\n\n\nCommunication is of the order of seconds and less reliable than a\nloosely coupled system.\n\n\nAs discussed, there are several possibilities for the computer\narchitecture of a distributed computing system.\n\n\nBut the theme of our definition is clear - - autonomous processors (\nwith unshared primary memory) that cooperate by passing messages. \n\n \n\nThere are several reasons why building distributed computing\nsystems are so attractive.\n\n\nThis attraction exists because of the following reasons:  sharing\n ,  parallelism  ,  fault-tolerance  , and \ninherent distribution  of some applications. \n\n \n\nThe primary reason for the attractiveness of distributed\ncomputing systems is its capability for  sharing  .\n\n\nResources ( e.g. program files, data files, processors, primary\nmemory, printers, etc.) can be shared by the different processes running in\nthe system.\n\n\nThese resources are open to those that are authorized to access them.\n\n\nThis sharing is possible because of the existence of the\ncommunications network.\n\n\nA remote user can simply present a resource with an authorization\npermit if access to that resource is required.\n\n\nIf the access permit is determined to be legal, access is therefore\nallowed.\n\n\nAny system that is connected by some form of a communications network\ncan achieve some level of sharing.\n\n\nHowever, distributed computing systems are designed in such a way\nthat the sharing ( to some extent) is transparent.\n\n\nThis requirement provides the users with a single system abstraction.\n\n\n \n\nInvoking processes in parallel has been one of the earliest\nmethods for computation speedup.\n\n\nThis is not unique of distributed computing systems because shared\nmemory multiprocessor systems were originally conceived to increase\nprocessing speed by running several processes in parallel.\n\n\nAlthough not unique,  parallelism  in distributed computing\nsystems offer greater advantage in that it provides the possibility of\ndynamic growth.\n\n\nAs the demand for more processing power increases, distributed\ncomputing systems offer a simple solution of connecting extra processors (\ntypically a workstation) to the network.\n\n\nThis power of scaling to larger numbers of processors makes a\ndistributed computing system a big contender for parallelism.\n\n\n[ CHAND91] provides a review of how parallelism will affect the\ndiscipline of computing in the coming decade. \n\n \n\nProcessors in distributed computing systems may be called on\ndemand to accomplish a certain task.\n\n\nProcessors are given messages indicating the task to be performed and\nthe result is returned as soon as a processor completes its task.\n\n\nDistributed computing systems consist of processors that are\ngeographically dispersed.\n\n\nThis geographic distribution can make distributed computing systems\nmore reliable.\n\n\nThe autonomous nature of the processors isolates problems in case one\nprocessor fails.\n\n\nFailure of one or a number of processors does not affect the others,\nenabling the system to possess a property called partial failure [ BAL89].\n\n\nWith the existence of multiple processors, processes may be\nreplicated so that when a processor fails, other processors may be summoned\nto take the place of the failed processor.\n\n\nThe partial failure property and the possibility to replicate\nprocesses make distributed computing systems a good candidate for programming\n fault-tolerant  applications.\n\n\n[ CRIST91] gives an excellent review of the fundamental concepts in\nfault-tolerant distributed computing systems. \n\n \n\nThe last motivation for programming distributed computing systems\ncomes from the observation that some applications are  inherently\ndistributed  .\n\n\nFor example, an automobile assembly line may consist of several\nsections, each performing a defined task.\n\n\nEach section is independent of the others but coordinates to trigger\nthe others to perform their task.\n\n\nAnother example is a patient monitoring system where readings from\ndifferent sensors ( e. g. temperature, pulse, blood pressure) connected to a\npatient are sent to the nurse station where they are analyzed.\n\n\nThere are still other applications of this nature and distributed\ncomputing systems, by their character, fit well to the implementation of such\nsystems. \n\n\n 2. 0 The Object Model \n\n \n\nThe term \" object-oriented \" is probably one of\nthe most confusing terms encountered in the computer industry today.\n\n\nNovice researchers of object-oriented technology will easily get lost\nin a maze of different programming languages, environments, and design\nmethodologies that have created their own vocabulary to describe the same\nconcept.\n\n\nIn our effort to avoid this confusion, we present a higher-level\nabstraction of \" object-orientation. &rdquo;\n\n\nOur concept of object orientation is embodied in our definition of\nthe object model.\n\n\nOur use of the phrase \" object model \" may conflict\nwith some of the published literature ( [ BOOCH91], [ BOOCH94]), but our\npresentation shows those concepts that we feel are basic.\n\n\nThis approach will put into perspective the discussions that ensue.\n\n\n \n\nObjects are basic to the object oriented model.\n\n\nThey are entities that model problem domain items as communicating\nagents that possess a unique behavior.\n\n\nThis concept may be traced back to the 1940s as tools used for\ndigital simulation [ NYGAA86].\n\n\nLater, this concept was used in the first object-oriented programming\nlanguage, \" Simula \" , in the 1960s [ EGE92].\n\n\nAnother important development that led to its popularity is the\nrelease of the \" Smalltalk Language \" in the 1970s.\n\n\n\" Smalltalk \" opened the flood gate for the release\nof other object-oriented languages such as \" Smalltalk-80, C++,\nEiffel, Objective-C \" ,  etc.  \n\n \n\nAn  object  embodies an abstraction of the services that\nit can provide to its users.\n\n\nThe services provided by the object defines its behavior.\n\n\nThe behavior of the object can be realized by passing a message to\nthe object.\n\n\nAn object that receives a valid message performs some action\nspecified by that message.\n\n\nObjects encapsulate information that is not pertinent to the\nunderstanding of the services that it provides.\n\n\nObjects may have services and data that are important only to itself\nand these are hidden from the users of the object.\n\n\nObjects may be organized in modules to enhance the understanding of\nthe system being modelled.\n\n\nIn some languages, there is no concept of module, but, we feel that\na module is an important requirement for programming-in-the-large.\n\n\nObjects in the system may run concurrently and an object may exhibit\nconcurrent behavior.\n\n\nIn the following discussions, we elaborate on the elements of the\nobject model.\n\n\nThese elements are  abstraction  ,  encapsulation \n,  modularity  , and  concurrency  . \n\n \n\n Abstraction  is how we deal with the complexities of\nproblem domain animate and inanimate objects.\n\n\nWe understand a great deal of things around us by simply\nunderstanding how it affects our lives.\n\n\nOur understanding of real-world objects may be different from that\nof others.\n\n\nThe degree of our understanding depends so much on how a particular\nobject affects our profession, our daily routine and responsibilities, our\npersonality, and even our character.\n\n\nThis real-life interpretation of objects can transcend to computer\nsystems. \n\n \n\nAbstraction presents a view of how an object may be interpreted\nand used.\n\n\nIt provides a boundary to the information that an object can provide\nto its clients and how these are made available.\n\n\nThe interpretation of information in this context is not limited to\ndata but extends to the services.\n\n\nThis is a good way of separating concerns between the clients of the\nobject and the object itself.\n\n\nThe client need not concern itself with how data and services are\nmade available nor how these are implemented.\n\n\nThe clients ' concern is simply to see what information is available\nand to be able to use this for its purpose.\n\n\nFor example, clients can get information from an object without\nbothering about how this information is made available. \n\n \n\nAbstraction avoids misinterpretation of a client 's\nunderstanding of an object because the object specifically identifies what it\ncan and cannot provide.\n\n\nAn object 's abstraction is seen in the object 's  interface\n .\n\n\nThe interface of the object allows it to show the services and data\nthat are available.\n\n\nClients of the object cannot get information other than through its\ninterface.\n\n\nIn the object model, objects communicate only by passing messages.\n\n\nIf an object requires some service from another, this object will\npass a message saying what information is required.\n\n\nOnce this request is received by the object, it performs some\noperation on itself, and returns ( if any) some value as a result of the\nrequest.\n\n\nThis implies that an object is allowed to manipulate only itself.\n\n\nIt is true that an object can require another to perform some task,\nbut, the actual manipulation of the required data or service is done in the\ncalled object. \n\n \n\n Encapsulation  , also called \" \ninformation hiding  \" , is the process of hiding the\nimplementation of the objects ' behavior.\n\n\nAn object is encapsulated if the clients of the object are\nrestricted by the definition of the programming language to access the object\nonly via its defined external interface [ SNYDE86].\n\n\nThe concepts of abstraction and encapsulation are complementary.\n\n\nAbstraction focuses on the external view of the object and\nencapsulation prevents clients from seeing the internal view, where the\nbehavior of the abstraction is implemented [ BOOCH91], [ BOOCH94].", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "Effect of Tempering of Milled Rice on Some Properties of\nDry-Milled Flour  \n\n\n James A. Patindol and Bienvenido O. Juliano \n\n \n\n Key Words:  Tempering, dry-milled rice flour, amylose\ncontent, particle size index, steamed cake   puto   ,\nwhite layer cake, cake volume, softness index, wet-milled flour. \n\n \n\nTempering milled rice at 20% moisture content for 3-6 hr prior to\ngrinding with the Philrice flour mill improved flour fineness ( indexed by\nparticle size index [ PSI]) of IR24 ( 15.8% amylose content [ AC]), PSB Rc 12\n( 23.4% AC) and PSB Rc 10 ( 26.8% AC) without effect on damaged starch in all\nexcept PSB Rc 12.\n\n\nPSB Rc 10 had the lowest damaged starch.\n\n\nWet-milled flour had less damaged starch and steamed rice cake ( \n puto   ) volume but greater white layer cake volume, and\nhigher softness index ( SI) than dry-milled flour.\n\n\nPSI correlated negatively with   puto   volume\nand SI, and positively with layer cake volume and SI for the 60 samples.\n\n\nDamaged starch correlated negatively with   puto \n and layer cake volume.\n\n\nVolume and SI correlated positively for both   puto\n  and layer cake. \n\n\n  INTRODUCTION  \n\n \n\nPhilippine rice flours are either dry-milled or wet-milled ( Tua,\n1980).\n\n\nSemidry-milled rice is also processed in Taiwan ( Lu  et al.\n , 1988).\n\n\nDry-milled and semidry-milled flour particles are fragments of rice\ngrains and wet-milled flour particles are clusters of starch granules ( Lu\n et al.  , 1988; Arisaka  et al.  ,\n1992).\n\n\nStarch damage is higher in dry-milled flour. \n\n \n\nThe availability of a dry-milled rice flour that can be used for\nall applications for which dry-milled and wet-milled rice flour are used\nwould be desirable.\n\n\nMilled rice had been replaced by corn starch in the manufacture of\nrice noodles (   bihon   ) in the Philippines (\nCarpio and Aco, 1990).\n\n\nContributing factors are the need to prepare beforehand wet-milled\nrice batter and the poor shelf life of the batter.\n\n\nBy contrast, corn starch can substitute for wet-milled rice flour and\nproduction of noodles can be proceed immediately on sunny days.\n\n\nCorn starch noodles are also whiter and cheaper than rice noodles.\n\n\nThai wet-milled rice flours are available in the market and can\ncompete with corn starch and local wet-milled waxy rice. \n\n \n\nCommercial U.S. dry-milled flours ( Riviana and California\nNatural Products) have 95-100%&lt;300 um ( &gt;50-mesh), 60-70% or\n75-85%&lt;150 um ( &gt;100-mesh), and 45-55% or 60-70%&lt;106 um (\n&gt;140-mesh), whereas a Belgian rice flour ( Remy) has 75-85%&lt;150 um (\n&gt;100-mesh).\n\n\nThe Philippines National Grains Authority dry-milled flour in 1980\nwas either &lt;75 um ( &gt;200-mesh) or &lt;50 um ( &gt;300-mesh) ( Tua,\n1980).\n\n\nWet-milled spray-dried U. S. rice flour form aggregates of 30-50 um\nspheres ( Mitchell, 1994).\n\n\nWet-milled waxy flour has mean particle size of 48 um ( Juliano and\nSakurai, 1985) and 50-60 um ( Yeh  et al.  , 1991).\n\n\nRecently, the PhilRice ( 1994) flourmill has been used for the\npreparation of dry-milled rice flour.\n\n\nMean flour particle size was 280 um with a 500 um screen.\n\n\nTo remove the grittiness of baked product from this 280 um flour, a\nfiner screen is installed to obtain a finer flour ( PhilRice, 1994). \n\n \n\nIn the dry-milling of wheat and corn, conditioning or tempering\nby adding moisture to soften the cereal endosperm is an integral part of the\nprocess.\n\n\nTempering should crack and soften the milled rice and increase flour\nfineness without increasing starch damage during milling ( Saito, 1980; KFRI,\n1994).\n\n\nThus, we studied the optimum conditions for milled rice tempering\nprior to milling in the PhilRice flourmill, identified some physical and\nphysicochemical properties of the flour and their effect on the volume and\nsoftness of a typical wet-milled flour product, baking powder-leavened\nsteamed rice cake (   puto   ) , and a typical\ndry-milled flour product, high-ratio white layer cake, as compared with\ndry-milled and wet-milled flours, using three nonwaxy varieties representing\nthe three amylose types ( Patindol, 1995). \n\n\n  MATERIALS AND METHODS  \n\n\n  Materials  \n\n \n\nRough rice samples were obtained from the seed production and\nseed health units of PhilRice.\n\n\nMoisture content was measured with a Dole 400 moisture tester.\n\n\nAfter at least 6 months in storage ( aging), they were dehulled by a\nSatake TH-35A dehuller, milled by a McGill miller No. 2, and then stored at -\n20 C. \n\n\n  Rice Flours  \n\n \n\nTempering was done by gradual spraying of three milled rices (\nIR24, PSB Rc 10 and PSB Rc 12) with a calculated amount of distilled water\nusing a hand atomizer to adjust moisture content to 16, 18 and 20% wet basis.\n\n\nMoistened samples were tempered in sealed plastic bags for 1, 3, 6\nand 12 hr and then ground into Flour using the PhilRice ( 1994) flourmill (\nRenien fan mill model) with 150-um ( 100-mesh) screen.\n\n\nThe mill had to be cooled every one hour run to avoid over-heating\nthe sample.\n\n\nTemperature of the freshly milled flour ranged from 30 to 45 C. \n\n \n\nPreliminary tempering trials were performed up to 26% moisture\ncontent.\n\n\nMilled rice cracked and became opaque at high moisture levels.\n\n\nAt 26% moisture, the flour particles clogged the perforated screen of\nthe flour mill and were mostly retained in the cyclone separator.\n\n\nStorage of the flours, without drying, in airtight glass jars for 1\nweek resulted in molds and yellowing in flours tempered at 22, 24 and 26%\nmoisture, whereas those tempered at 16, 18, and 20% moisture were visually\nfree of molds.\n\n\nBased on these trials, tempering was then limited to 16, 18 and 20%\nmoisture and after milling, flours were dried in an air oven at 30 C for 6\nhr. \n\n \n\nIn addition to a dry-milled rice flour check ( nontempered),\nmilled rice was also soaked in twice its weight of water for 1, 3, 6 and 12\nhr and ground ( wet-milled) with a motorized coffee grinder.\n\n\nThe flour slurry was poured into a cheesecloth bag and excess water\nwas allowed to drain by gravity for 2 hr.\n\n\nThe wet-milled batter was dried in an air oven at 30 C for 12 hr and\npulverized with a mortar and pestle. \n\n\n  Physicochemical Analyses of Flours  \n\n \n\nStarting milled rices were analyzed for crude protein, apparent\namylose content ( AC) ( Juliano  et al.  , 1981) and total\nlipids ( Mani&ntilde;gat and Juliano, 1980).\n\n\nFlour whiteness was measured with a Kett whiteness meter model C4.\n\n\nParticle size index was determined according to AACC ( 1983) as the\npercentage of flour passing through a 200-mesh screen from 10 g flour shaken\n10 min on a Ro-Tap sieve shaker.\n\n\nDamaged starch was determined by dispersing 500 mg flour in 50 ml o.\n25N HCL for 2 hr at 55 C ( Arisaka  et al.  , 1992),\ncentrifuging at 100 g for 20 min and the dispersed starch measured in the\nsupernate by phenol-sulfuric acid method ( Dubois  et al. \n, 1956) with glucose as standard.\n\n\nRapid Vico Analyzer ( RVA) curves were obtained in 3 g rice flour in\n25 ml of water held for 1.0 min at 50 C, heated to 95 C at 12 C/min, held for\n2.5 min at 95 C, and then cooled to 50 C at 12 C/min ( Blakeney  et\nal.  , 1991). \n\n\n  Rice Cakes  \n\n \n\n  Puto   was prepared according to Perez\nand Juliano ( 1988).\n\n\nFlour ( 100 g) was soaked for 1 hr in 140 ml water in a mixing bowl\nand mixed in a National electric mixer at speed 1 for 5 min.\n\n\nSugar ( 40 g) was added and the batter nixed for 2 min at speed 1.\n\n\nDouble-acting baking powder ( 4,5 g) was then added and the batter\nmixed for 1 min. batter ( 40 g) was poured into ungreased round aluminum pans\n( 40 mm bottom diam, 67 mm top diam, 25 mm height) and immediately steamed\nfor 30 min, cooled 1 hr in the open, and placed in self-sealing plastic bags.\n\n\n  Puto   volume was measured by the rapeseed\ndisplacement method.\n\n\nSoftness index ( in mm) was determined on 4- x 4-cm and 2.5-mm-thick\nsamples by a digital penetrometer ( Petrotest PNR 10, Mitamura Riken Kogyo,\nInc.) using a 98-g plunger with 50-g weight and a 50-g calottetipped piston.\n\n\nPenetration time was 5 sec and penetration depth ( softness index)\nwas measured. \n\n \n\nHigh-ratio white layer cake formulation was employed with some\nmodification ( AACC, 1993).\n\n\nThe formula ( in % flour basis) consisted of 100% rice flour, 90%\nsucrose, 20% baking soda and 3% cream nonfat dry milk, 60% water, 1.5% NaCl,\n2% baking soda and 3% cream tartar.\n\n\nThe dry ingredients except cream of tartar were combined and sifted\nwell and transferred to a National electric mixer mixing bowl containing the\nliquid ingredients previously beaten for 2 min at speed 1.\n\n\nThe ingredients were mixed for 5 min at speed 1, the batter scraped\ndown from the sides, the cream of tartar added, and the batter beaten further\nfor 2 min.\n\n\nTwo 150-g batter portions were transferred into round pans lined with\nparchment paper at the bottom and baked in a preheated oven at 177 C for 30\nmin.\n\n\nThe cake was cooled in the open for 2 hr and its volume and softness\ndetermined by the method used on   puto   . \n\n\n  Statistical Treatment  \n\n \n\nThe study was laid out in a 5 x 4 x 3 factor-factorial completely\nrandomized design.\n\n\nThe factors considered were tempering moisture ( dry, 16%, 18%, 20%,\nand wet), tempering time ( 1, 3, 6 and 12 hr) and variety ( IR24, PSB Rc 10,\nand PSB Rc 12).\n\n\nEach treatment combination was replicated twice.\n\n\nAnalysis of variance was used to detect any significant effect of the\ntreatment variables on the properties of the flour.\n\n\nDuncan 's ( 1955) multiple range test was calculated to identify\nsignificant treatment means or combinations. \n\n\n  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  \n\n\n  Dry-milled Flour Properties and Cakes  \n\n \n\nThe three milled rices had their expected AC ( low AC for IR24,\nintermediate AC for PSB Rc 12, and high AC for PSB Rc 10) and gelatinization\ntemperature ( GT), but PSB Rc 12 had intermediate rather than low GT ( Table\n1).\n\n\nPSB Rc 12 had higher protein content than the others but the total\nlipid content was higher in PSB Rc 12 than in IR24.\n\n\nGel consistency was softest for IR24.  \n\n \n\nDry-milling using the PhilRice flourmill produced flours with\nparticle size index ( PSI) of 51-53% passing through 75 um ( 200-mesh) sieve\n( Table 1).\n\n\nThis was finer than the reported particle size of 280 um for the\nPhilRice mill with 500-um sieve ( PhilRice 1994) and comparable to that of\ncommercial dry-milled flour.\n\n\nDamaged starch was lower in the high-AC PSB Rc 10 than in the others.\n\n\nIR24 had the highest RVA peak viscosity and the lowest RVA\nconsistency.\n\n\nPSB Rc 12 had the lowest RVA peak viscosity and PSB Rc 10 had the\nhighest consistency. \n\n \n\n  Puto   volume was higher for the\nhigh-AC PSB Rc 10, but PSB Rc 12 had the lower softness index of the three\nflours ( Table 1).\n\n\nPerez and Juliano ( 1988) reported that AC correlates positively with\n  puto   height and hardness, but the hardest \n puto   was low-GT intermediate Ac rice, just like PSB Rc\n12, rather than high AC rice.\n\n\nBy contrast, volume of white layer cake was similar but softness\nindex was highest for low-AC IR24 and lowest for high-AC PSB Rc 10.\n\n\nThe intermediate GT of high-AC PSB Rc 10 probably contributed to its\nharder layer cake due to incomplete starch gelatinization as the batters had\nsimilar water contents ( Perez and Juliano, 1988). \n\n\n  Wet-milled and Tempered Dry-milled Flours and Cakes\n \n\n \n\nTempering the three milled rices at 16%, 18% and 20% moisture for\n1, 3, 6 and 12 hr before dry-milling can improve PSI of the flour ( Table 2).\n\n\nTempering at 20% moisture for 3 or 6 hr significantly improved PSI of\nflour in the three rices.\n\n\nDamaged starch levels in the pretempered flours were similar to those\nof the dry milled flours: 3.1-3.9% for PSB Rc 10, 8.0-9.4% for PSB Rc 12, and\n9.2-9.8% in IR24.\n\n\nThus, tempering did not aggravate the damaged starch content of the\nflour and remained higher in IR24 and PSB Rc 12 than in PSB Rc 10.\n\n\nTempering of milled rice at 20% moisture for 3 or 6 hr before\ndry-milling resulted in flours with similar PSI as wet-milled flour ( Table\n2).\n\n\nThe improvement in flour fineness from tempering was less than those\nreported by Saito ( 1980, 1987) for Japanese rice, probably because the\ndry-milled flour was already fine as indexed by PSI ( Table 1).\n\n\nWet-milled flours had similar PSI as 20%-moisture-tempered dry-milled\nflours ( Table 1): 0.4-0.9% for PSB Rc 10, 0.9-1.2% for PSB Rc 12, and\n1.1-1.4% for IR24, because of milder milling conditions, and since damaged\nstarch swell in water and is removed with the supernate during centrifugation\nof wet-milled flour.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "0a50e98f-75fd-437d-bd0b-b1c05cbedb1e", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.216617+00:00"}

Introduction  \n\n \n\nAn \"  Intelligent Tutoring System  ( ITS)\n\" is a computer-based tutor that qualitatively models the cognitive\nprocess of its learners in order to effectively diagnose and correct their\nerrors and misconceptions  .\n\n\nAlthough many architectures have been proposed for Intelligent\nTutoring Systems, a few components seem to be present in all.\n\n\nThese are the student model, tutor model, domain model and the\ninterface.\n\n\n\" The  student model  \" , which is one of\nthe major components of an ITS, assesses a student 's performance by\ndetermining what the student knows, his or her misconceptions and the causes\nof these misconceptions.\n\n\nThus, the primary function of the student model is to interpret the\nlearner 's behavior. \n\n \n\nClancey, in his tutorial survey of ITSs, presented \" \nTurtle  ,  Meno  and  Proust  \" which are\nsome of the existing tutors concerned with teaching computer programming\n .\n\n\nOther student simulation programs are \"  Marcel \n\" and \"  Grapes  \"  .\n\n\nDespite the success of these existing programming tutors, there still\nis a need for domain extension.\n\n\nThese tutors all rely on a static library of misconceptions.\n\n\nIf the errors committed by the student are not in the library, these\ntutoring systems will no longer be able to determine the misconceptions\nunderlying their errant behavior. \n\n \n\nStudent modeling systems form models of the student 's ability\nbased on the observed behavior of the student, which in the case of this\npaper, is usually in the form of student solutions ( i.e., programs) to a\ngiven programming problem.\n\n\nIt is impossible to determine all students ' programming errors and\npreprogram these in the student model.\n\n\nThis paper focuses on the design of an extension algorithm for a\ndomain theory for Pascal programming.\n\n\nThis helps determine the cause ( or causes) of the student 's error\neven if it is not preprogrammed in the student model. \n\n\n  2. The Domain Theory Structure \n\n \n\nA major prerequisite in developing a student model is to identify\nthe errors students commit and the origin of these errors.\n\n\nAnderson [ 1] stated that it is important to identify the errors\nstudent make, to understand the origin of these errors, and code the inferred\nbuggy productions one by one into the system. \n\n \n\nAn analysis of the non-syntactic errors found in programs written\nby novice Pascal programmers ' errors was performed.\n\n\nSix programming problems were given to the students.\n\n\nThese are \" functions, for-do, while-do, repeat-until,\nif-then and arrays \"  .\n\n\nA domain theory subnetwork was created for each of these problems.\n\n\nThe set of programming plans and codes, both correct and incorrect,\ntaken from the analysis form the initial domain theory. \n\n\n  2. 1 Levels, Frames and Slots  \n\n \n\nIn this design, the domain theory is represented as a \nnetwork  .\n\n\nEach state in the network is represented using  frame-based\nstructure  and each frame has  slots  . \n\n \n\nThe domain network structure has four levels: the  root level\n , the  plan level  , the  subplan level  and the \ninstance level  ( Fig. 1 shows an example).\n\n\nThe root level has only one frame which represents the  start\nstate  .\n\n\nAll frames in all four levels have a  name slot  which\ncontains the name ( or description) of the frame.\n\n\nIn addition to the  name slot  , the start state has a \nplan slot  for the alternative plans that the domain theory has for\nsolving a given programming problem.\n\n\nThe connections from the start state to the  plan frames \nare  disjunctive  . \n\n \n\nAt the  plan level  , each state ( called a  plan\nframe  ) is used to represent programming plans.\n\n\n Plans  are stereotypic methods for implementing the problem\nrequirements that appear in the problem descriptions.\n\n\nEach of these frames has  constant slot  and  variable\nslot  for the constants and variables used in the plan, respectively.\n\n\nThe variables placed in the  variable slot  are also called\n pattern variables  , that is, variables used in the student program\nwill be used to substitute these pattern variables.\n\n\nThe plan frame also have a slot for the set of subplans in\nimplementing the plan called the  subplan slot  .\n\n\nSince all these plans are necessary to carry out a plan, the links\nfrom the plan frames to the  subplan frames  are  conjunctive\n .\n\n\nThese subplans must also be checked in the order they were placed in\nthe  subplan slot  . \n\n \n\nThe  subplan frames  also have  constant  and\n variable slots  .\n\n\nThe constant and variable slots have the same definition as those\ndefined in the plan frame.\n\n\nOnly, these slots identify the constants and variables used in the\nsubplan.\n\n\nThe  instance slot  identifies alternative code\nimplementation of the subplan.\n\n\nThis indicates that the subplan is implemented similarly ( i.e., have\nthe same meaning) but appears differently in code.\n\n\nFig. 2 shows an example of a subplan that adds two numbers with two\n instances  .\n\n\nBoth implementations have the same meaning but appears differently in\ncode.\n\n\nAt the subplan level,  subplan frames  may have the same\nvalue for the  name slot  but different values in other slots.\n\n\nIn this situation, the intention of the subplans is the same but is\nimplemented differently.\n\n\nFig. 2 shows an example of subplans with the same name, one is\ncorrect and the other is not. \n\n \n\nIn addition, both the  subplan  and  plan frames\n have a type slot for determining if it is the correct or incorrect\nimplementation of the plan/subplan.\n\n\nThis will serve as a guide in determining the errors in the student\nprograms. \n\n \n\nThe last level is the  instance level  .\n\n\nThe states in this level are called  instance frames  .\n\n\nThe three slots in this frame are the  name slot  , \ngeneral error slot  and the  code pattern slot  .\n\n\nThe most important slot is the  code pattern slot  which\ndescribes the form the Pascal code has in implementing the subplan.\n\n\nThe  general error slot  indicates the general error or type\nstatement categories to which the code belongs. \n\n \n\nA subplan frame can have a link to one or more plan frames but an\ninstance frame can only have a single link to a subplan frame ( i.e., subplan\nframes can not have the same value for their instance slots). \n\n\n  3. The Domain Theory Extension  \n\n \n\nThe impossibility of pre-enumerating all student 's errors and\nrepresent these in the domain theory creates the need for extending the\ndomain theory.\n\n\nThis section discusses the design of an algorithm that uses both\ninduction and deduction to infer missing operators from the initial\nformulation of the domain theory. \n\n\n  3. 1 The Extension Algorithm  \n\n \n\nLearning occurs at the plan, subplan and instance level.\n\n\nLearning at the instance level implies that the programming plans and\nsubplans used by the student are present in the domain theory but are written\ndifferently in code.\n\n\nLearning at the subplan level, on the other hand, implies that the\nprogramming plan is present in the domain theory but the subplans are\nimplemented differently and are logically different.\n\n\nIn this case, there is also learning at the instance level.\n\n\nLearning at the plan level indicates that the student 's programming\nplan is not present in the domain theory.\n\n\nTable 1 states the summary of the extension algorithm  . \n\n\n  3. 2 Deduction  \n\n \n\nDeductive inference  in this\nalgorithm can be classified into three categories: \"  valid\nsentence transformation  ,  valid program transformation  and\n perturbation  \" . \n\n\n  Valid Sentence Transformation  \n\n \n\nThe first step in the algorithm requires the forward traversal of\nthe network towards the goal state.\n\n\nDuring the matching of the plan instances to the student 's program\nstatements,  valid sentence transformations  are applied to the \ninstance frame  if the expected Pascal code differ from the statement in\nthe student program.\n\n\nValid sentence transformations are legal Pascal transformation rules.\n\n\nThey are applied in the first instance that the student code does not\nmatch with the database code. \n\n \n\nThe following are the valid sentence transformation:\n\n \n\n1. If the statement contains a Pascal expression then alter the\nexpression using the commutative, associative and distributive law.\n\n\nA Pascal expression may be an arithmetic or Boolean expression.\n\n\nFor example:  \n\n \n\n2. If the statement is a Pascal input/output statement then\ninterchange the position of the variables. \n\n\n  Valid Program Transformation  \n\n \n\nThe purpose of the  valid transformation  is to generate\nall possible sequences of the statements without altering the programming\nplan.\n\n\nTable 2 shows the summary of the rules for valid program\ntransformation. \n\n \n\nThe \" read and write sets \" of the instances in\nthe database were first generated, followed by the level of each statement\nwith respect to its depth in the program ( i.e., if it belongs to a block).\n\n\n\n  Perturbation  \n\n \n\n\" Perturbation \"  is applied\nonly after the first two classifications of deductive inference fail to reach\nthe goal.\n\n\nIn \" perturbation \" , each instance frame of the\nplans is matched to its corresponding statement in the student program.\n\n\nIf an impasse occurs, perturbations are implemented to the instance\nframe. \n\n \n\nThe design was to generate all possible combinations.\n\n\nHowever, it is only up to the point where the expressions did not\nmatch.\n\n\nFor example, if the expression did not match at an operator, it will\nbe perturbed by modifying only that operator, thus generating all possible\ncombinations of expressions where different operators are involved at that\nparticular point/node.\n\n\nIf it did not match on an operand, it will be perturbed to produce a\nlist of the same expression but with different operands at the point where\nthe statement did not match.\n\n\nIf a match is not found after the perturbation, the original\nstatement will be used for succeeding perturbations.\n\n\nApproaches to perturbation are as follows:\n\n\n 1. Modifying operators \n\n \n\nThe mathematical and logical operators are modified.\n\n\nAll possible permutations of operators are applied.\n\n\nThe rules for modification are as follows:\n\n\na. If the operator is a mathematical operator ( i.e., +, - , *, / ,\ndiv, mod) or a logical operator ( i.e., &gt;,&lt;,=,&gt;=,&lt;=,&lt; &gt;),\nchoose a new mathematical/logical operator ( e.g., the new operator is\ndifferent from the original operator).\n\n\nb. If the operator is a logical connective ( i.e., \" and\n\" , \" or \" ) , choose a new operator different from\nthe original operator.\n\n\nIf the operator is \" \" not &rdquo; \" , remove\nthe operator \n\n\n 2. Delete sub-expressions \n\n \n\nThis type of perturbation removes a mathematical operator and an\noperand ( e.g., constants or variables) to the expression.\n\n\nFor example, given the statement x:=y/12/100, one valid perturbation\nis x:=y/12. \n\n\n 3. Exchange operands \n\n \n\nAnother type of perturbation is to swap operands.\n\n\nOperands may be in the form of variables or constants.\n\n\nFor example, a:=b/c+10 can be perturbed to a:=c/b+10 or a:=b/10+c;\n\n\n\n 4. Alter variables \n\n \n\nWhen assigning values to the  pattern variables  in the\ndomain theory, one policy is that only variables in the student program are\nallowed to be substituted to the pattern variables.\n\n\nTwo ways of altering the variables are to allow constants to be\nbound to the free variables and to allow substitution of variables in the\nstudent program to the bound variables in the domain theory.\n\n\nThe bound variable is converted to a pattern variable so that a\ndifferent variable can be substituted to it.\n\n\nIf the goal is reached after this alteration then this implies that\nthe student used a variable different from what is expected in the domain\ntheory. \n\n\n 5. Alter Constants \n\n \n\nConstants used in the expression are changed to other constant\nvalues.\n\n\nThe constant values that are used as substitution are taken from the\nlist of constants used in the plan. \n\n\n 6. Delete input/output arguments \n\n \n\nSome of the arguments in the input/output statements are deleted\nas part of the perturbation.\n\n\nFor example, readln(a); readln(b) can be perturbed to readln(a); or\nreadln(b); \n\n\n 7. Modify Construct \n\n \n\nStatements that have almost the same purpose are used as basis\nfor modifying the construct.\n\n\nAn example of modification is to change the \"  if-then\nstatement  \" to \"  while-do statement \n\" and vice versa.\n\n\n\" If-then and while-do statement \" have almost the\nsame objective, that is, to check first its condition before executing the\nstatement after it.\n\n\nTheir only difference is that \" if-then \" executes\nthe statement after it once, whereas \" while-do statement \"\nexecutes the statement after it several times ( depending on the happening of\nan event). \n\n\nOther statements that may be interchanged are  writeln  and\n readln.  \n\n \n\nIf the perturbations applied results to the attainment of a\nmatch in the program statement in the goal then the perturbation is learned\nas a rule at the subplan level and the program code is learned as a rule at\nthe instance level. \n\n\n  3. 3 Induction  \n\n \n\nIf after applying deductive inference the goal is still not\nreached then inductive inference  is applied.\n\n\nThis means that the student program ( or goal) have a different\nprogramming plan.\n\n\nThe following states how a plan is learned: \n\n \n\n1. Inductive inferencing uses  backward chaining  .\n\n\nFrom the goal, each statement is matched to the instance frames.\n\n\n \n\na. If the statement matches the instance frame, then the subplan\nis determined.\n\n\nIt is possible that the subplans used by the student are in the\ndomain theory but they are used differently. \n\n \n\nb. Otherwise, apply perturbations to the code pattern slot.\n\n\nIf the perturbed statement matches the student 's statement,\ndetermine its subplan.\n\n\nLearn this as a new subplan ( with the same subplan name). \n\n \n\nc. Otherwise, learn an entirely new subplan.\n\n\nThis involves inductive inference of a new subplan. \n\n \n\n2. The subplan that has been determined at ( 1) will be included\nin the list of subplans of the new plan while the variables and constants\nused will be included in the list of constants and variables for the plan.\n\n\n \n\nIn learning a new value for the code pattern in the instance\nslot, the variables in the student program statement must be converted to\npattern variables.\n\n\nThis pattern variables to be used is determined by specifying which\npattern variables were the program variables substituted to.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "041f1452-f4ec-495b-aaae-a81449450e6f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.217543+00:00"}
{"text": "A Way of Seeing Multi-original Art for Those with Slim\nWallets  \n\n\n Emmanuel Torres \n\n \n\nFOR CESAR Villalon Jr., the die is cast.\n\n\nHe is gearing up for a venture he has wanted to do for some time: run\nan art gallery devoted entirely to prints or the graphic arts, drawings,\ncollages and photographs.\n\n\nHe has found the space on the ground floor of Metrostar Building, 1007\nMetropolitan Ave., at the east end of Ayala Avenue, Makati, and he intends to\nname it \" The Drawing Room \" .\n\n\nIt 'll open later this month. \n\n \n\nWhat could be more sensible in a time of diminishing expectations,\nwith an East Asian currency crisis following decades of tiger economies in\nthe region, than to shift attention from painting - - the premier art form of\nchoice for most collectors - - to works just as original, esthetically valid,\na lot less expensive, and eminently collectible? \n\n \n\nWhen paintings by young talents of the likes of Alfredo Esquillo (\nHiraya), Enrique Tabuena ( Art Matters) and Emmanuel Garibay (\nLiongoren/Boston) now command on the average from &peso;30,000 to\n&peso;60,000, while those in midcareer fetch upward of that range, one has\ncause to pause before pulling out that checkbook. \n\n \n\nWith the market for paintings badly hit in these belt-tightening\ntimes, Villalon 's entrepreneurial sense is turning to drawings and prints -\n- given that there are still those out there with separable cash for whom art\nis a viable psychic need.\n\n\nNot only are they satisfying to collect for what they reveal of an\nartist 's skill and sense of form, but their appeal to the budget-conscious,\nnot to mention the investment-wise looking for quality with a price tag a\nfraction of the cost of a painting, are also obvious. \n\n \n\nFactors determining precise cost would, of course, depend on an\nartist 's talent and stature.\n\n\nIf it has intrinsic merit, its value appreciates as much as any work\nin a painting medium by the same artist, assuming that his or her importance\nis eventually confirmed over time.\n\n\nSo long as drawings or prints are perceived for their distinctive\nhallmarks, they are neither less than nor inferior to paintings. \n\n \n\nLovers of prints tend to be also lovers of drawings.\n\n\nThe backbone of printmaking, or much of it, is draftsmanship, as\nexemplified by such notable living graphic artists - - many of whom happen to\nbe painters as well - - as Arturo Luz, Rod. Paras-Perez, Mario Parial and\nNeil Doloricon ( woodcuts, rubbercuts), J. Elizalde Navarro, Juvenal Sanso,\nBenCab, Imelda Cajipe-Endaya, Virgilio Aviado, Brenda Fajardo and Fil\nDelacruz ( etchings, lithographs).\n\n\nThey partially represent a source of printmaking that calls for\ngreater advocacy from galleries through well informed dealership in entire\neditions. \n\n\n  Mad about prints  \n\n \n\nDrawings and prints may not have the kind of visual impact as\npaintings do at first contact.\n\n\nBut their quieter, more intimate appeal is well known worldwide to\nprint collectors.\n\n\nThough fewer in number, they can be just as enthusiastic and\npassionate as collectors of painting, even to the exclusion of works in oils,\nacrylics and watercolors. \n\n \n\nA common if loose analogy made to distinguish the experience of\npaintings from that of drawings and prints is that the former is like an\norchestral work ( symphony, concerto, overture) for their sonority and tonal\nrichness, while the latter is like chamber music with fewer instrumental\nforces ( duo, trio, quartet, etc.) but just as capable of providing listening\nexperience no less pleasurable, intense and profound than an orchestra in\nfull cry. \n\n \n\nThrough knowledge and habit, drawings and prints grow on you as\nyou begin to perceive them in their own right and not simply as cheaper\n\" alternatives &rdquo; to paintings.\n\n\nInterior designers may tell you it is unwise to hang an ink drawing\nor a black-and-white woodblock print beside an oil on canvas, or that\ndrawings and prints look better grouped together.\n\n\nNonsense.\n\n\nIf a sketch or an etching has artistic merit, it can hold its own\nagainst anything else beside it except perhaps a mural. \n\n \n\n\" The Drawing Room \" 's 45-sq. - m. white cube\nof space is just right for what it intends to showcase.\n\n\nBy their very nature - - generally small-scale and intimate in\nambience - - drawings and prints require close viewing.\n\n\nWith a knowledgeable manager on hand to advise beginning collectors\non such matters as conventional relation between the edition size and price (\ni.e., the larger the edition, the less expensive the print), Villalon 's\nwhite cube fills in a gap in the local gallery system by supporting and\npromoting standard or mainstream fine prints. \n\n \n\nBecause drawings and prints ( given that they have intrinsic\nvalue and are properly maintained) appreciate in monetary terms, it is\nimportant for a buyer to know standard maintenance requirement: they must be\nmatted and framed under glass to protect them from dust, grime and grease.\n\n\n \n\nSpecial attention must be paid to the matboard used in framing:\nthe ideal is one that is acid-free ( now available in Metro Manila) to\nprevent molds from developing on its surface and under the glass component of\nthe frame.\n\n\nIt would be a boon to collectors if this were made available at\n\" The Drawing Room \" at all times. \n\n \n\nThe one challenge Villalon 's gallery faces is how to develop a\nclientele by knowing how to handle questions commonly asked about prints and\ndrawings, especially the former. \n\n\n  What is a print?  \n\n \n\nRequired of dealer, gallery owner and manager is a precise\nknowledge of the four general processes for making original prints: the\nrelief process ( woodcuts, engravings), incised or  intaglio\n ( etching, aquatint, mezzotint, drypoint), lithography, and\nstencil ( serigraphy, more widely known as silkscreen). \n\n \n\nThey must also be conversant with the distinct graphic qualities\nof each of these four types of printmaking, such as: the striking contrasts\nbetween black and white areas in woodcuts, the silver-toned sharp lines in\netchings, the soft-grained, supple strokes in lithographs, and the often\nbright chromatic forms and superfine textures in silkscreens. \n\n \n\nThey must also be familiar with the various graphic media to be\nable to provide information on the practice of limiting the number of copies\nin an edition of a print as set by the artist and the obligatory destruction\nof the plate once the edition is completed. \n\n \n\nIt takes expertise moreover to inform gallerygoers and beginning\ncollectors that although multiple copies of a print are pulled out from a\nplate, the quality of their individual production is controlled, and that\neach copy is an original. \n\n \n\nOne can do no better than quote from \" \" What Is an\nOriginal Print? &rdquo; \" published by the authoritative Print\nCouncil of America,  \" a nonprofit organization fostering the\ncreation, dissemination, and appreciation of fine prints, new and old,\n&rdquo;  whose membership is a veritable Who 's Who is the\ninternational art world. \n\n \n\nAn  original print  is a work of graphic art, the\ngeneral requirements of which are: 1. The artist alone has made the image in\nor upon the plate, stone, woodblock or other material, for the purpose of\ncreating a work of graphic art. 2. The impression is made directly from that\noriginal material, by the artist or pursuant to his directions. 3. The\nfinished print is approved by the artist.  \n\n \n\nA reproduction is something else.\n\n\nIt is made by photomechanical process and is not an original fine\nprint.\n\n\nA reproduction is a replica no matter how high-tech or refined\ndespite concerted efforts by a group a few years back to pass them off in the\ngallery system as \" \" works of art, &rdquo; \" which\ndrew considerable reaction from informed quarters who blew the whistle on\nthis group and was decried by critic Paras-Perez in no uncertain terms. \n\n \n\nThere is nothing wrong, of course, with a gallery dealing in\nreproductions, the finer the better, as long as these are sold for what they\nare, and not purveyed wittingly or unwittingly as affordable \"\n\" works of art. &rdquo; \" \n\n\n  Muddying the waters  \n\n \n\nConfusing the issues further at the time was the cavalier\ncooperation of certain noted artists who were persuaded to affix their\nsignatures on photographic reproductions of their drawings which were made\nprecisely for purposes of reproduction and, therefore, left unsigned.\n\n\nSigning these superfine photomechanical repros is supposed to signify\ntheir approval of these repros. \n\n \n\nThere is nothing wrong with that, as long as buyers are \ninformed  of what they are getting: fine-grade if extra-expensive (\nthanks to the artists ' signatures) repros/replicas/facsimiles. \n\n \n\nThe trouble is that the artists consenting to this business\narrangement muddy the waters further by allowing their  signed repros\n to be marketed as \" \" works of art. &rdquo; \"\n\n\nThis can be misleading: labeling them \" \" works of art\n&rdquo; \" indicates that they are  originals  , which of\ncourse they are not, no matter how advanced the technology used may be.\n\n\nThey are no more original than a xerox copy of one 's thumbmark. \n\n\n  Silkscreens and a sweet tooth  \n\n \n\nA common perception of graphic artworks that concerns the\nbeginning collector is that they are not colorful or bright enough.\n\n\nIn which case, go for silkscreens, or serigraphs, especially those of\na size not likely to be mistaken for chocolate-box illustrations. \n\n \n\nUndoubtedly silkscreens are the most popular of print media and\nthe most commercially viable: you can print them by the thousands, as in the\nproduction of T-shirts, posters, streamers and holiday greeting cards. \n\n \n\nA gallery specializing in prints should be able to guide serious\ncollectors toward designs specifically created for the silkscreen medium as\nof greater artistic interest and collectible value, such as works by Rodolfo\nSamonte and Impy Pilapil. \n\n\n  Clearing the air  \n\n \n\n\" The Drawing Room \" comes at a time when the\nPhilippine Association of Printmakers is being revitalized by its able\npresident, Fil Delacruz. \n\n \n\nLast month the PAP held \"  \" Kinutkot\nKutkot, &rdquo;  \" an exhibition of recent, mostly \nintaglio  , works by members that include such dedicated mainstays\nin printmaking as Navarro, Paras-Perez, Aviado and Delacruz, and younger\npractitioners like Ojeng Jocano, Jess Isidro Flores and Benjie Torrado.\n\n\nTheir show at Gallery Y, lasting less than a week - -  \"\n Parang pinagbigyan lang kami!  ( Like it was some favor\ngranted to us!)\"  as a PAP member puts it - - is proof positive of\nthe lackluster interest in prints that prevails today in local art circles.\n\n\nTwo mini-print portfolios, each containing 20 works by as many\nartists, have been issued by PAP ( &peso;25,000 per portfolio, or &peso;1,250\nper print). \n\n \n\nFurther evidence of the lack of appreciation of prints is the\nterribly underreported traveling show \" \" Prints and Drawings\nfrom Weimar Republic &rdquo; \" recently held at Metropolitan Museum\nof Manila, which featured such formidable visual artists from a crucial\nperiod of German history as Kathe Kollwitz, Otto Dix, Max Beckmann and George\nGrozs. \n\n \n\nIt made a strong case for the emotionally involving graphic power\nof prints as a popular medium in a worldclass show that, alas, did not get\nthe wide publicity it deserved from the Philippine media. \n\n \n\nIt is hoped \" The Drawing Room \" can change the\nprevailing attitudes toward the graphic arts: not only in reviving greater\ninterest in them as a genuine source of artistic satisfaction, but also in\nclearing the air of the haze that has developed around prints caused by\nunscrupulous parties. \n\n \n\nNo reproduction, no matter how state-of-the-art it is, can\nreplicate the resonance and immediacy of an original fine print.\n\n\nAs the irrepressible Sanso, printmaker  nonpareil \n, loves to say by way of comparison:  \" it 's the difference\nbetween kissing a woman and making a kissing sound to her over the phone.\n\n\nWhat a difference! &rdquo;   \n\n\n  For Drilon and Robles, Art Is Like a Prayer  \n\n\n Emmanuel Torres \n\n\n\n \n\nTIME was when the likes of the late Vicente Manansala could say,\n \" I don't have to explain my art.\n\n\nIf I were good with words, I wouldn't be a painter but a writer.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nSuch excuse for not being verbally articulate once common among\nvisual artists no longer convinces anyone today.\n\n\nGlobalization has made it counterproductive, specially in light of\nincreased cultural interaction within Asean as well as local and foreign\nnetworks ( CNN, BBC, CNBC) nudging artists to speak up in talk shows, let\nalone a growing sophistication in leading galleries such as \" Hiraya\n\" and \" Galleria Duemila \" urging them to look to\ntheir craft as more than a commodity and product of market forces. \n\n \n\nAll this is good news, for whatever arouses the public to see art\nnot only as decor but as an object with a thinking mind behind it - - a\ndefining drive or body of beliefs - - is welcome. \n\n \n\nThe last past months have seen notable exhibitions by Emmanuel\nGaribay ( Liongoren/Boston), Alfredo Esquillo Jr. ( Hiraya) and Egai\nFernandez ( Genesis) alluding to evangelical and sociocultural motives other\nthan purely aesthetic ones. \n\n \n\nAnd of late two artists in their 40s, Rock Drilon ( Brix) and\nRoberto M. A. Robles ( Duemila) have spoken of their art as analogous to\nprayer, which is certain to raise the question: When does art become prayer?\n\n\nOr the hackles of the cynical: Are galleries now dealing the\nreligious card as inspirational ploy in a time of global economic\nuncertainty?  ...", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "5cc486ad-90ec-45bb-93c8-e30a67ca3a4a", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.219013+00:00"}

  \n\n \n\nThe excerpt is from \" \" Demolition Derby, &rdquo;\n\" Bambi Harper 's column item ( PDI, 5/18/96). \n\n \n\nShe is correct to observe that at the fast clip we make fine dust\nout of our heritage architecture these days, it will not be long before we do\nnot even have memories of pre-condominium days in Manila.\n\n\nWe tear down buildings mercilessly.\n\n\nJust so we know what kind of dust we are creating to add more\npollution to our already deadly city air, some of that dust could have been\nthe remains of the innovative and pioneering work of Andres Luna de San\nPedro, one of the pillars of Philippine architecture. \n\n \n\nWho is Andres Luna de San Pedro?\n\n\nWhy should we Filipinos take notice of his work?\n\n\nWhat relevance is he to us in this day when we have entered the age\nof superglobalization?\n\n\nHow can he compare with the revered icons of American architecture\nthat are now doing buildings in Manila? \n\n\n  Architectural visionaries  \n\n \n\nAndres Luna de San Pedro was among the few architectural\nvisionaries of the 1930s.\n\n\nHis vision made Manila a great place to live in. \n\n \n\nThe 19th-century Filipino nationalist and expatriate painter Juan\nLuna and Paz Pardo de Tavera brought up their son Andres in Europe.\n\n\nThere he received the best education and was exposed to the latest\ntrends in architecture.\n\n\nHe returned to the Philippines in the 1920s to practice. \n\n \n\nLuna de San Pedro was the most senior among the group that\nhistorian Winand Klassenin in his book \" \" Architecture in the\nPhilippines &rdquo; \" ( University of San Carlos Press, Cebu, 1986)\ncalled \" \" the second generation of Filipino architects.\n&rdquo; \"\n\n\nThe group included National Artist Pablo Antonio, Fernando Ocampo and\nNational Artist Juan Nakpil. \n\n \n\nThese architects, trained in the United States and Europe,\nplanted the seed of Modernism.\n\n\nThey moved Filipino architecture away from the elegant neoclassical\nbuildings of their predecessors ( Manila Post Office, De La Salle College and\nthe many provincial capitols are some examples of the neoclassical).\n\n\nWith them, Filipino architecture upgraded, caught up with the global\ntrend of the day, and entered what was considered the high-tech era of the\n1930s. \n\n\n  The earliest skyscrapers  \n\n \n\nLuna de San Pedro was responsible for bringing the new\ninternational image to Filipino architecture. \n\n \n\nOf his many buildings on the Escolta, his Art  Nouveau\n - inspired \" Luis Perez-Samanillo Building \" (\nstill standing), one of his best-designed buildings, opens large glass\nwindows to bring natural light and ventilation into each of the five stories\nof the structure.\n\n\nIt was one of Manila 's earliest skyscrapers. \n\n \n\nHis \" Chaco Building \" , built in 1924 and still\nstanding on Plaza Cervantes at the foot of Jones Bridge, is still as visually\ndelightful today as when it blazed the trail for modern architecture 70 years\nago.\n\n\nIt features a remarkable series of undulating balconies on each\nfloor, leading to extraordinary corner towers. \n\n \n\nThe building adds a monumental flair to Plaza Cervantes.\n\n\nBefore the recent construction of the neo-Chinese entrance archway\nthat blocked the view of the Chaco Building from the plaza, the structure 's\ncorner tower functioned in the 1939s as the ceremonial entrance to powerful\nBinondo, which has continued to maintain its position as the financial center\nof the country. \n\n\n  The standard  \n\n \n\nLuna de San Pedro is best known for his \" Crystal Arcade\n\" , a commercial complex on the Escolta destroyed at the end of\nWorld War II.\n\n\nRows of shops opened on many levels to a central glass-covered\narcade.\n\n\nIts street facade featured glass paneling and horizontal strips of\nwindows. \n\n \n\nIt was a Manila landmark, the most popular commercial building in\nthe city.\n\n\n Avant-garde  in design, many considered it the\nmost modern building in Manila during its time.\n\n\nIt set the tend for prewar commercial buildings and was the standard\nfor later developments in the generations to follow. \n\n \n\nThe vanished house at Padre Faura corner Roxas Boulevard that\nHarper wrote about had a checkered history.\n\n\nBuilt as a residence for one of the Zobel families, the ownership of\nthe structure changed hands in the 1950s.\n\n\nIt remained as a residence until the 1960s, when the residents moved\nout and converted the interior of the stately house into a bank, paving over\nits large garden to provide parking. \n\n \n\nAfter the bank moved out in the 1970s, two squat wings were added\nperpendicular to each side of the facade facing Roxas Boulevard, ruining the\nsophisticated proportions of the structure.\n\n\nIt became a minishopping center.\n\n\nIn the ' 90s, it was finally razed down to give way to a high-rise\ndevelopment. \n\n \n\nThat house was a symphony.\n\n\nIt was a meticulously planned, powerful piece of architecture that\nsolidly rose from the ground and built up in a  crescendo \nthat ended in the massive but visually delicate roof.\n\n\nIts  terra-cotta  tile roof undulated in a gentle\nwave that marked the principal entrance to the house. \n\n\n  The grandest staircase  \n\n \n\nDirectly under wave of the roof, a balcony at the center of the\nmain facade provided an upper level view of Manila Bay across the boulevard\nwhile shading the front door beneath it from rain and sun. \n\n \n\nUpon entering the house, what was probably the grandest staircase\nin all of Manila wound its way from the foyer, sweeping like a great, curling\nwave of highly polished  narra  steps leading to the second\nfloor of the house. \n\n \n\nEven if the house 's design took inspiration from European Art\nDeco, the style was sensitively adapted to fit the Filipino environment.\n\n\nSince the house was built before the days of air conditioning,\nwindows were bigger than the small European opening designed to keep the\nwinter cold out.\n\n\nAwnings above the windows added the aura of tropical grace while\nprotecting the interiors from rain and the excessive heat of tropical\nsunshine. \n\n \n\nHarper continues:  \" There are structures. ...that\ncan be considered historic or architectural treasures. \n\n\nThe Zobel house designed by Luna de San Pedro was one, being the\nwork of the leading architect of the era and an example of a style evocative\nof a period known as \" 'peace time' \" ....\n\n\nSo on with the demolitions.\n\n\nWatch your past come hurtling down. &rdquo;    \n\n\n\n\n  The role of   comedias   and\n  zarzuelas   in Philippine history  \n\n\n Aida C. Tiama \n\n \n\nThe coming of May is awaited by most people not only because it\nis a time of flowers, but more because it is the month of  fiestas\n .\n\n\nUntil now, people in the provinces anticipate with excitement the\ncoming of the town  fiesta  .\n\n\nEven  provincianos  in Metro Manila go home, just\nso they can attend their town  fiesta  .\n\n\nFor these people the town  fiesta  is the most\nexciting part of the year for they see the stage shows, musicians, religious\nprocessions, fairs, games, and fireworks, arches of bamboo decorated with\nflowers, garlands, ribbons, etc. and colored buntings stretched across the\nwindows of houses.\n\n\nMore importantly, it is during  fiesta  when they\nreunite with long-time friends, acquaintances, and relatives. \n\n \n\nThe importance of  fiestas  to our ancestors\nin the nineteenth century is evidenced by historical records.\n\n\nOur National Hero, Dr. Jose P. Rizal, sent a letter to his friend,\nMariano Catigbac, who was then residing in Lipa, Batangas just to invite him\nto Calamba, Laguna 's fiesta in June 1879. \n\n \n\nFather Leoncio Lopez of Calamba wrote Rizal, who was in\nBarcelona, Spain on August 25, 1882, and told the latter about the \n\" most animated  fiesta  in Calamba on account of\nthe numerous people who attended it. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nJose M. Cecilio, a close friend of Rizal, wrote the letter on\nSeptember 30, 1885, saying that he was enjoying the  fiestas\n , while Rizal was \" studying diseases &rdquo; abroad. \n\n \n\nUntil the 50s, barrio folks ate their supper early during the\n fiesta  and went to the town  plaza \nin carts or  calesas  before darkness primarily to watch\nthe   comedia   and/or   zarzuela\n  . \n\n \n\nBoth   comedia   and  \nzarzuela   were staged by actors and actresses who travelled\nfrom  fiesta  to  fiesta  . \n\n \n\nThe   comedia   is a form of popular\ntheater which recounts tales of adventure and passion drawn from medieval\nSpanish ballads about the days of chivalry.\n\n\nThe fights between individuals were executed in steps of the\n curracha  tune with the accompaniment of a brass or\nbamboo band.\n\n\nThe audience either screamed or even booed the performers. \n\n \n\nThe   zarzuela   , on the other hand,\nis more of a musical theater.\n\n\nIts vernacular version is responsible for forming and crystallizing\nthe taste of the masses for musicals. \n\n \n\nDuring the Spanish period, the   comedia \n dramas from   awits   and  \nkoridos   , which were famous long poems and verses, revolved\naround the loves of princes and princesses, acted out by the  \nmestizos   and   mestizas   who\nwere \" good-looking &rdquo; by virtue of their fair skin, aquiline\nnose, and towering height.\n\n\nThey also depicted the fights, between Christians and Moors in Europe\nduring the Middle Ages, including swordfights, music, bright costumes, kings,\nqueens, princes, and princesses.\n\n\nThe story was always about the conflicts between Christians and\ninfidels - - the Moors - - who had come to invade Spain.\n\n\nThe fights accounted for at least half of the total performance\nbecause the audience demanded that fights be prolonged, especially if the\nfighters displayed a charming or novel way of fighting with sword, dagger, or\nspear. \n\n \n\nWhen pleased, the audience would throw gift money on the stage.\n\n\nFinal victory was always that of the Spaniards and this was\nconsidered a triumph for Christianity. \n\n \n\nThe story was almost always told in songs and conversations were\nalways in verse, so interesting and easy to remember that children could tell\nand retell them among themselves, could play the swordfights over and over\nagain, and could even stage their own   comedia  \n( with the help of their parents) in a quieter, much more modest version\ncalled  carillo  or shadow play.\n\n\nThey repeated the story of the warring princes using stick and\ncardboard figures held against a lamp so that their shadows fell on a white\nsheet.\n\n\nIt was said that when Jose Rizal was a young boy, he made up\nmarvelous stories for these plays. \n\n \n\nThe   comedia   ,  \nzarzuela   , and   moro-moro   , which\nwere adaptations of the European drama, glorified then the princes and\nprincesses who were portrayed as innocent and extremely kind-hearted. \n\n \n\nAll good was rewarded and all evil was punished.\n\n\nNaturally, the natives in the audience would cheer and espouse the\ncause of the white Spaniard and would emulate the underdogs in the drama who\nsuffered in silence and would choose to embrace submissiveness as a virtue.\n\n\n \n\nThe most awaited character in a   comedia \n is the clown called \"   huenchehuenche \n \" .\n\n\nHe is usually a black man who prances about and says the most\nunexpected things.\n\n\nToday, he is used by the writer to criticize erring public officials,\npoliticians and attack social ills. \n\n \n\nActors do not just walk.\n\n\nThey march, prance, and dance.\n\n\nWithin a single   comedia   , there is at\nleast three swordfights and as many as six.\n\n\nThe audience await the swordfights eagerly, watching with bated\nbreath although they know that in the end, the Christian prince would emerge\nthe victor. \n\n \n\nThe Christian prince makes a triumphant speech and rewarded with\nmarriage to a beautiful princess.\n\n\nAn angel approaches him and takes his hand and lead him in promenade\namong the loyal believers and the departed infidels. \n\n \n\nThe themes in the   comedias   were\nmaintained by the Spaniards in the   zarzuelas  \n, which they introduced in the latter half of the 19th century, when the\n  comedias   were fading away.\n\n\n  Zarzuela   entered its golden age with\nthe debut of Atang de la Rama in \"   Dalagang Bukid \n \" , a movie adaptation from Hermogenes Ilagan 's most\nfamous   zarzuela   .\n\n\nDuring these years, Filipino film borrowed plots from the \n zarzuelas   . \n\n \n\nThe first   comedia   titled\n\"   Gran comedia de la toma del pueblo de corralat y\nconquista de Cerro   \" was written by a priest.\n\n\n  Comedia   was staged by the Spanish\nmissionaries as a form of religious discourse, together with the \n pasyon   ,   sinakulo   ,\n  korido   , and   awit  \n, not only to ensure the acceptance and spread of Christianity among the\nnatives but also to court the latter to support the colonial regime. \n\n \n\nThe primary motive of the playwrights was to promote the\ninterest of the Church and the State, thus the perceptions, values and norms\nimparted through the crude theater promoted the colonial culture.\n\n\nThe native intellectuals were used to translate into the native\ntongue the   comedias   and  \nzarzuelas   . \n\n \n\nHence, the   comedias   and\n  zarzuelas   helped strengthen the more than\nthree centuries of Spanish colonial rule.\n\n\nBut the extreme abuses of the friars and the   guardia\ncivil   in real life broke the spell of the  \nzarzuelas   and led to the revolution. \n\n \n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, particularly in the\n1870s, marked by the \" Propaganda Movement \" led by Jose P.\nRizal and Marcelo H. del Pilar, the discontented local intellectuals used the\nsame   comedias   and   zarzuelas\n  to weaken the power of the friars and rally the masses to\nfight oppression and Spanish rule.\n\n\nFor instance, Andres Bonifacio, who was a   komedya\n  actor, wrote verses that called the people to revolt.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "7f72cc71-6e07-49cd-bf33-05c4ab3330cb", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.220525+00:00"}
{"text": "Did Adam and Eve live in Africa?  \n\n\n Dean Jorge Bocobo \n\n \n\nIN THE WELL-KNOWN story from the book of Genesis, the first man\nand woman were Adam and Eve.\n\n\nLiving at first in the Garden of Eden, before they were cast out for\npartaking of the forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge, they were created\nin the very image of God Himself. \n\n \n\nWho were Adam and Eve, the first human beings?\n\n\nAnd where was the Garden of Eden?\n\n\nWhen did they live there and when did they leave? \n\n \n\nJews, Christians and Moslems who all share this version of human\norigins have pondered and speculated upon these questions for all the\nmillennia that the Book of Genesis has existed, first as part of the Jewish\n Torah  , then as the Christian Bible and later in the\nMuslim  Koran  . \n\n \n\nA well-documented attempt to answer when Adam and Eve lived in the\nGarden of Eden was that of James Ussher, Archbishop of Armagh in Northern\nIreland sometime in the 17th century.\n\n\nThe latter used the precise genealogies of the Jewish nation\ncontained in the Old Testament to work backwards to the seven days of\ncreation contained in Genesis, pegging them to have occurred sometime in the\nyear 4004 BC. \n\n \n\nActually, the good archbishop was trying to answer the question\nof how old the earth is, but his calculation also applies to Adam and Eve\nsince both planet and people were created in the same week, if one takes\nGenesis to be literally true. \n\n \n\nHardly anyone today accepts Archbishop Ussher 's estimate for the\nage of the earth, certainly not the non-Christian civilizations of China and\nIndia, which happen to be the most populous countries of the world and which\nboth have existing historical records of their continuous history from\nthousands of years before the proposed date of 4004 BC. \n\n\n  Earth age  \n\n \n\nModern geology estimates the earth 's age to be closer to 5\nbillion years, give or take a billion.\n\n\nThis estimate is controversial too, with astronomers and cosmologists\nmixing it up with the geologists over the age of the solar system, the Milky\nWay Galaxy to which it belongs, and of the universe itself.\n\n\nBut there is consensus that the earth is much, much older than the\nhuman species. \n\n \n\nTreated scientifically, the whole question of the first human\nbeings, who they were, where they began and when, has become a part of the\ntheory of evolution proposed by Charles Darwin in his 1859 book, \"\n\" On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, &rdquo;\n\" which has, since its publication, revolutionized our\nunderstandings of life on this earth, both human and nonhuman alike. \n\n \n\nOf course, Darwin also confounded the religious concept of living\ncreatures like man by introducing the idea of evolution, in which species\narise not fully formed and well-defined, but as the result of long, slow, but\nthoroughly dynamic process. \n\n \n\nSo that to the list of questions posed above, one must add\nperhaps the confusing question of how to define the human species to begin\nwith.\n\n\nAlong the tree of evolution, when can we start regarding a branch\ncontaining manlike creatures as humans? \n\n \n\nUntil very recently, all the scientific light on the subject of\nhuman origins was being shed by paleoanthropologists ( the \"\nbonehunters\"), who specialize in the search for and analysis of fossil\nremains.\n\n\nBy painstakingly reconstructing these artifacts of bone and tools\nfound in the earth 's crust, these scientists have outlined the evolutionary\nhistory of man from lower forms of life. \n\n \n\nA common misconception that has arisen in the public mind about\nthis whole field is that  \" man is descended from apes.\"\n\n\n\nActually, it is more accurate to say that both have a common\nancestor, probably some type of rodent! \n\n \n\nIn just the last decade or so, a whole new area of scientific\ninvestigation has made major contributions to the search for Adam and Eve:\nmolecular genetics, a field of biology that would not even be born for a\nhundred years when Darwin developed his theory of evolution.\n\n\nDarwin developed his theory purely on the basis of observations he\nmade on the anatomy and distribution of animal and plant species.\n\n\nHe could not explain the physical basis for evolution, that is, how\nit happens that the progeny of living things inherit the characteristics of\ntheir parents and why subtle changes occur to produce the grand diversity of\nlife on earth.\n\n\nThat had to await the discovery and understanding of the biochemistry\nof DNA - - deoxyribonucleic acid - - the molecule which contains the precise\ninstructions for the construction and development of all living things on\nearth. \n\n \n\nHow has biochemistry contributed to the search for Adam and Eve?\n\n\nIf we think about this problem as a detective would, and with the\nbenefit of hindsight 's 20/20 vision, it is easy to see why the\nfossil-hunters may have been looking in the wrong place.\n\n\nAfter all, since living human beings are direct descendants of the\noriginal human beings, they actually contain a lot of the relevant physical\nevidence.\n\n\nThe DNA in the cells of all our bodies came ultimately from those\nfirst human beings. \n\n\n  Question of genetics  \n\n \n\nWorking along these lines in 1987, molecular geneticists Mark\nStoneking, Allan Wilson and Rebecca Cann at the University of California (\nBerkeley) decided to test the idea that  \" the question of\nmodern human origins is ultimately a question of genetics. &rdquo; \n\n\n \n\nTheir approach to the problem was based on the observation that a\ncertain portion of the DNA in the cells of all human beings, called the\nmitochondrial DNA, or m-DNA for short, is inherited not from both parents,\nbut from the mother alone.\n\n\nMy m-DNA came directly from the ovum, or egg, which my mother\ncontributed and which was eventually fertilized by sperm from my father to\nmake me. \n\n \n\nHer m-DNA also came from my maternal grandmother, and so on, all\nthe way back to prehistory.\n\n\nLikewise, my father 's m-DNA came from my paternal grandmother, and\nso on, all the way back to some common ancestor, a woman we might call\nmitochondrial Eve, the mother of us all. \n\n \n\nNow it turns out that m-DNA in humans mutates at some measurable\nrate, accumulating subtle differences in biochemical composition as the\ngenerations pass.\n\n\nThese differences and mutations can be counted and analyzed and used\nas a kind of molecular clock. \n\n \n\nUsing this clock, geneticists can deduce from the number of\nmutations that are observed in the m-DNA of geographically separated human\npopulations roughly when those populations split off from one another in\nhistory. \n\n\n  Out of Africa  \n\n \n\nBy studying the DNA in blood samples taken from African, Asian,\nAustralian, Caucasian and New Guinean ethnic groups, Stoneking and company\nfound 133 variants of m-DNA with a corresponding complement of mutations and\ndifferences.\n\n\nBased on the parameters of the molecular clock, they discovered that\nthe oldest m-DNA belongs to the group of Africans in their sample, which\nsupports the so-called \" \" Out-of-Africa &rdquo; hypothesis\n\" currently subscribed to by the fossil-hunters. \n\n \n\nThis picture, which places our \" Garden of Eden &rdquo; in\nAfrica, proposes that modern humans arose in Africa some 200,000 years ago.\n\n\n \n\nStoneking and his group then discovered a piece of the m-DNA\ngenetic sequences that was common to all the subjects in their human sample.\n\n\nThis piece had to have been inherited from a single, common female\nancestor of all humans alive today, or at least those represented in the\nStoneking sample. \n\n \n\nThis mitochondrial Eve, the most recent common ancestor of all\nhumans alive today along the maternal line of descent, was determined by\nStoneking 's groups as having lived somewhere in Africa between 140,000 and\n290,000 years ago.\n\n\nThen, between 90,000 and 180,000 years ago, some of her descendants\nleft Africa and migrated to all the other parts of world, including the\nPhilippines. \n\n \n\nHow about Adam?\n\n\nAnother group of geneticists associated with Yale University\nprofessor Robert Dorit, has developed a similar molecular clock along the\npaternal line of descent, based on a portion of the Y-chromosome that is\ninherited only along the male line. \n\n \n\nBy performing a study of separated human populations similar to\nthe Stoneking project, the most recent common male ancestor of humans alive\ntoday was estimated to have lived some 270,000 years ago, again in Africa.\n\n\nThis study showed that the exodus from Africa seems to have occurred\nsome 156,000 years ago.\n\n\nBoth dates are not inconsistent with the study of the matrilineal\ndescent. \n\n \n\nSo has Genesis ' Adam and Eve been found by modern genetics?\nWell, not really.\n\n\nMitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosome Adam are truly the female and male\ncommon ancestors, respectively, of all humans alive today.\n\n\nBut it is likely that they were not alone in the hypothesized\n\" African Garden of Eden \" .\n\n\nIt is just that the other human women with whom mitochondrial Eve\nlived, do not have living descendants today.\n\n\nSince their m-DNA can only be passed along through their daughter,\nthose of them who did not have girl babies will have no representatives alive\ntoday. \n\n \n\nLikewise for Y-chromosome Adam.\n\n\nIn fact, the title of \" \" most recent common ancestor\nof all humans alive today &rdquo; \" changes as the human population\nchanges by the process of the dying out of the various maternal and paternal\nlines of descent. \n\n \n\nAs for the title of the oldest common ancestors, the fabled Adam\nand Eve, that

Romero, I suspect that many\nof us are \" great recyclers. &rdquo;\n\n\nI 'm just admitting that you know that we know that you know what we 've\nbeen doing all this time to Christmas gifts ( and wedding gifts too). \n\n \n\nThen why do I write about something done but not talked about?\n\n\nLet 's say it might be a relief to be frank about yet another taboo.\n\n\nSo let 's face it; 'tis the season for recycling. \n\n \n\nHave you ever opened a gift and asked, \"  Ano 'yan?\n &rdquo;  .\n\n\nI once turned over a gift in my hands, figuring out what it was.\n\n\nMy kids described it as \" \" the skull cap in electric\nchairs, &rdquo; \" only this one was made of fibrous material similar\nto a split coconut.\n\n\nIts giver was not trying to be cute because she was a nonsense woman,\nbut she was thrifty and even  this  must not go to waste, I\ndidn't have the heart to recycle it on somebody.\n\n\nI threw it. \n\n \n\nI still have another exotic gift at the bottom of my closet.\n\n\nIt looks like a squirrel with goldpainted tail and feet.\n\n\nThe rest is white glass \" mosaic, &rdquo; green for the ears\nand red for the eye.\n\n\nIt 's for hanging on the wall ( for what?) to see my fragmented image\nand be dazzled by reflected light?\n\n\nIt 's too cruel even for an \" exchange gift. &rdquo;\n\n\nIt 's the kind of gift for which you feel like saying  \"\nReturn to Sender. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nI once suggested a \" white elephant party &rdquo; hoping\nthat somebody 's junk might be somebody 's treasure.\n\n\nI was shot down.\n\n\nIt wasn't such an original idea after all.\n\n\nIt had been done before and the poor hostess was dumped with white\nelephants which even their owners refused to claim. \n\n \n\nThe height, I think of the situation 's absurdity was when a gift\nI once gave actually came back to me!\n\n\nI know because the route was very traceable. \n\n \n\nThe most cold-blooded practice I 've been doing lately is - - as\ngifts come in, out they go - - food, wine and whiskey ( my husband and I have\nno minor vices), items we can live without in this shedding stage of our\nlives.\n\n\nBy Christmas Day, half the work of \" classifying &rdquo; is\ndone and I can sit on the floor and open gifts much more slowly and with\ngreater pleasure. \n\n \n\nAm I being a KJ  like the KJs in Ayala\nAlabang last Halloween?\n\n\nNo, I 'm not trying to reinvent Christmas.\n\n\nOn the contrary I 'm trying to recapture some of its lost spirit.\n\n\n \n\nI 'm talking time, quiet time against the mad rush to the malls\nto finish my list; quiet time to savor Christmas songs in the airwaves since\nSeptember, to be enveloped by the nippy winds even in this  El\nNi&ntilde;o  October, to feel that if you had but time to pause,\nChristmas is already \" in the air. &rdquo;\n\n\nI 'm talking just one Christmas party per family and some quiet time\nbefore the   Belen   . \n\n \n\nI 'm talking joy.\n\n\nWhy must sheer joy over gifts be experienced only by children like a\ngrandnephew who then and there peeled off his T-shirt and put on the new one;\nlike a grandniece who looked up to heaven, rolled her eyes and sighed,\n\" Oh, a \" Toblerone \" \" ; like my children who\nused to rub oil on the wrappers trying to peep at the contents; like my\nlittle son who said, \"  Wala na ba akong tatalupan? \n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nHow can we feel the magic when we can't linger while shopping and\ntake time to say,  \" Now, what would he really want?\"  ,\nwhen in a pile of gifts it 's hard to find one that we can hold to our hearts\nand say,  \" How did you know this is what I wanted?\"  ;\nwhen we 're exhausted unless you believe that exhaustion is part of the\nspirit? \n\n \n\nI 'm talking imagination that Rudy Romero misses in his\npredictable pile of  \" umbrellas, pen sets, organizers, desk\nclocks, paper weights, desk sets and diaries. &rdquo; \n\n\nHow can we be imaginative when we have to buy and wrap gifts in\nassembly-line fashion? \n\n \n\nI 'm talking moderation when we and our children are being led to\nbelieve that the higher the pile, the better; when the feeling of plenty has\nbecome excess and it 's time to say \" Enough. &rdquo; \n\n \n\nI 'm talking sharing because at a certain point  \"\nthe superfluities of the rich are the necessities of the poor.\" \n\n\nThe umbrellas and bags with names of banks across them are basic\nneeds of the families of  lavanderas  , drivers,\nconstruction workers, vendors, etc.\n\n\nOften, one of each has to make do for the entire year.\n\n\nThe calendars we receive are eagerly accepted by them as fast as\nthey come.\n\n\nUnfortunately, they have no use for the knickknacks we give each\nother.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "7f958b6c-f2ea-4cda-ae5e-33b0880a6676", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.221911+00:00"}
{"text": "An auspicious beginning for the National Museum Complex\n \n\n\n Cynthia O. Valdes \n\n \n\nLIKE a dream come true, the much-longed-for home for our National\nMuseum has begun to see the light of day.\n\n\nFirst in a complex of three buildings, the National Museum Complex (\nthe newly renovated Finance building) has opened its doors to the Philippine\npublic. \n\n \n\nOn June 11, eve of the Philippine Centennial, a select group\ncomposed of sponsors, donors and benefactors previewed the transformation,\nalthough work on the interiors were not yet quite completed.\n\n\nNodding their collective heads in approval, guests and museum\nofficials inspected the ongoing renovations as well as an exhibit of\nartifacts from a shipwreck.\n\n\nAlso interesting was a well-stocked museum shop. \n\n \n\nWhat was once a familiar if somewhat shabby-looking American\nperiod building on Agrifina Circle had suddenly acquired a spanking new look.\n\n\nBasically, it is the same edifice, classic architecture and all.\n\n\nBut the renovations, mostly done on the interiors, have made it a\nfitting shelter for our national treasures, at least.\n\n\nThis building has been renamed \" National Museum of the\nFilipino People \" . \n\n \n\nThe Corinthian columns are still there, adding to the old world\nambiance this familiar landmark has acquired if only because it has been\naround for at least half a century.\n\n\nBlack iron grills with curlicues in simulated balconies mark the\nregularly spaced windows on the upper floors, softening somewhat the\nAmerican-style architecture of the 1930s. \n\n \n\nA five-floor trapezoid encloses a garden which can be viewed from\nall sides.\n\n\nAt front and center stands the \" Marble Hall \" ,\nearmarked to be the site of exhibit openings and a venue for formal functions\nand state dinners.\n\n\nIt is appropriately dignified with its polished marble walls and\nexceptionally high ceiling. \n\n\n  San Diego exhibit  \n\n \n\nSince its opening in June, a visibly impressed public have been\ncoming to view the imposing structure and its new interiors as well as two\nongoing exhibitions.\n\n\nDespite the presence of busy workmen who go about their unfinished\ntasks, schoolchildren have discovered, at last, what a museum should look\nlike. \n\n \n\nTwo second-floor exhibition rooms currently house the \"\n\" Homecoming Exhibit of the San Diego &rdquo; \" sent back to\nthe Philippines in coordination with sponsoring French institutions after\nsuccessful runs in Paris ( 1994), Madrid ( 1995), New York ( 1996) and Berlin\n( 1997). \n\n \n\nThe San Diego exhibit was a 1600 A.D. ship believed to have been\nbuilt in Cebu in 1590 by Basque, Chinese and Filipino craftsmen out of Asian\nwoods.\n\n\nMeasuring not more than 40 meters in length and 12 meters in width\nwith a height of 8 meters, it had been used as a trading vessel over the\nyears. \n\n \n\nSighting Dutch intruders at Manila Bay, Spanish authorities\ncommandeered what seemed to be an available vessel and converted it into a\nwarship, loading her with guns and cannons.\n\n\nA stockpile of more than 750 jars contained provisions for a longer\njourney than just a battle at the Bay.\n\n\nAn astute scholar has conjectured that the San Diego was probably\nprepared to give chase all the way to the Straits of Malacca, even to wait\nfor favorable winds in order to head back. \n\n \n\nA furious battle at the Bay sank the San Diego.\n\n\nAlmost four centuries after this event, a concerted effort by French\nmaritime explorers and our National Museum, using state-of-the-art\ntechnology, located the wreck off Fortune Island and proceeded to retrieve\nthe artifacts from under the sea. \n\n \n\nConservators chiseled away years of accumulated debris and coral\nencrustation to bring back the various objects to almost their original state\nnotwithstanding almost 400 years of burial under the ocean. \n\n \n\nThe \" San Diego Exhibit I \" illustrates a number\nof objects relating to life in Manila circa 1600 A.D.\n\n\nAmong these are wooden   santos   and\nfurniture from the period.\n\n\nThere are also huge canvasses depicting scenes from the Galleon\nTrade, European royalty, ships at sea and maps as well as a glass-enclosed\nwooden replica of a Manila Galleon. \n\n \n\nOther cases display artifacts still encrusted with coral debris\ntogether with cleaned specimen.\n\n\nImpressive are three large cannons with cannonballs against a\nbackdrop of galleons heaving mightily in a restless sea. \n\n \n\n\" Exhibit II \" greets the visitor with a\npanorama of stoneware jars, of all shapes and sizes, in various stages of\n\" undress &rdquo; ( its glazes worn off and the earthen body exposed).\n\n\nThey are innovatively displayed in a rough and tumble fashion,\nprobably in much the same manner they would be piled up as they await their\nturn to be loaded onto the ships. \n\n\n  Jars from all over  \n\n \n\nNot made in the Philippines, these jars have come from various\nfactories in Asia - - one more proof of the vast network connecting Manila\nwith other port cities.\n\n\nJars, being the preferred container in Asia where barrels and casks\nwould have been used in Europe, were used and reused over the centuries\nuntil, of course, they broke and had to be discarded.\n\n\nThere were Burmese jars, also called   martaban \n ( after a port city in the Burma coast through which they were\nshipped in the 15th to 17th centuries), Thai jars which were probably the\nmost numerous, and Chinese jars distinct for their designs of dragons with\nwrithing bodies.\n\n\nIn some jars the dragons climb up to the neck to form the lug\nhandles. \n\n \n\nOther jars had animal motifs such as tigers and squirrels or\nfloral designs of lotus connected by undulating vines and tendrils.\n\n\nA common feature of other shipwrecks of the period were Spanish jars.\n\n\nThey contained olives and olive oil which must have been an important\ncooking ingredient for Iberians on a long sea journey. \n\n \n\nAn array of attractive blue and white Chinese porcelain from the\nKangxi period ( 1662-1722) must have been intended to furnish the Captain 's\ntable as well as serve the elite staff on board.\n\n\nThese are bottles with a bulbshaped mouth to hold wines and liqueur,\ncups from which to sip them, plates, saucers and bowls and large platters to\ncomplete the services for what must have been an elegant table. \n\n \n\nDeer - - believed by the Chinese to be the only animal which can\nfind the sacred fungus or  Ling Zhi  , a plant of long\nlife and immortality and the \" \" Three Friends &rdquo;\n\" motif of bamboo, pine and prunusy - - decorate these vessels. \n\n\n  What it 's like inside  \n\n \n\nFor the more humble Filipino crew, there were earthenware vessels\nwith imbedded ceramic shards for decoration.\n\n\nThis is believed to have been a type of Manila ware produced during\nthe period.\n\n\nOther than common cooking and eating utensils, lighting fixtures were\nalso found.\n\n\nA pouring vessel with a humanlike feature on its handle and a pitcher\nwith rounded body and painted vegetal motif were probably remnants of\nprevious sojourns in Mexico.\n\n\nThey are reminiscent of  Puebla  pottery which\nwere frequently based on European models. \n\n \n\nChemical analysis reveal some of the original contents left over\nin some jars, such as fowl bones, peach pits, hazelnuts and coconut husk.\n\n\nAdequate provisions of food and drink could make or break a journey.\n\n\nSailors were often struck with nutrition-deficiency diseases due to\nlack of food and potable drinking water as well as poor sanitation during\nlong voyages. \n\n \n\nOther items on display easily call to mind what life on board\nship must have been like.\n\n\nA mortar and pestle as well as glass decanters, pincers and razors\ncould have made up an apothecary 's implements or a barber 's kit.\n\n\nA ship 's chronicler such as Pigafetta on Magellan 's voyage, had his\nwriting implements and ink slabs.\n\n\nChess pieces and buttons from board games must have whiled away long\nhours at sea.\n\n\nA man of God was always on board to minister to the men 's spiritual\nneeds and in this case, left behind his rosary and prayer book clasp. \n\n \n\nExcept for a few strings of gold necklaces and rings, no\nsignificant amount of jewelry was found.\n\n\nSundry coins from Spain, Mexico, China, Southeast Asia and India\ncould have made up the men 's pocket money to pay for games or alcohol on\nboard the ship. \n\n \n\nA significant find was Captain Morga 's seal.\n\n\nIt has been favorably compared to a Coat of Arms illustrated on the\ncover of his book \" \"  Sucesos de las Islas Filipinos\n . &rdquo; \" \n\n\n  Repository for heart and soul  \n\n \n\nThe former Finance building will eventually house the archeology,\nanthropology, and social history collections.\n\n\nThe Executive House which is where the administrative office of the\nNational Museum is located, will open in 2001 as the National Museum of Art.\n\n\nThe Tourism building scheduled to be opened in the year 2003 will be\nthe National Museum of Nature.\n\n\nThese edifices will undergo renovations in their interiors to convert\nthem into  \" world-class museum buildings with state-of-the-art\ntechnology\"  in terms of environment controls ( humidity,\ntemperature), exhibition presentations, conservation laboratories and\nartifact storage. \n\n \n\nIt is a most auspicious beginning, a much-hoped-for repository\nfor the heart and soul of the National Museum system.\n\n\nA truly revitalized National Museum, however, must necessarily\ninclude a fresh mandate for the professionals that give it life and meaning,\nand, last but not least, the support of the general public that it seeks to\ninspire.  \n\n\n\n\n  Rekindling a people 's patriotism thru art  \n\n\n   Sining Sentenaryo   \n\n\n Lynete L.

{"text": "Art is lifestyle  \n\n\n Ramon N. Villegas \n\n \n\nON MARCH 29, Black Saturday, Sotheby 's in Singapore auctioned off\nsome Philippine paintings.\n\n\nA \" \"  batis  \" scene \" by\nthe late National Artist Fernando Amorsolo reportedly fetched the equivalent\nof &peso;3.4 million.\n\n\nAnother 1950s Amorsolo, a \" \"  Dalagang May Banga\n ( Girl Holding A Cooking Pot), &rdquo; \" went for around\n&peso;1.5 million.\n\n\nA painting by a living artist, Ang Kiukok, went for &peso;.8 million,\nperhaps the highest price ever paid for his work. \n\n \n\nWhile the reports are still sketchy, it seems not all the\nPhilippine paintings were sold.\n\n\nHowever, those sold fetched a fortune - - the \" \"\n batis  \" scene \" went for six times its\noriginal &peso;.6 million.\n\n\nOne collector even pronounced the \" \"  Dalagang\nMay Banga  \" \" cheap at &peso;1.5 million, on top of\nSotheby 's commission.\n\n\nThe \" \" Ang Kiukok &rdquo; \" may have sold for\nless than &peso;.25 million around five years ago. \n\n \n\nThis auction was already the third of Sotheby 's newest line:\nSoutheast Asian art.\n\n\nThe series groups the paintings of Indonesia, Thailand, the\nPhilippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and others in the region. \n\n \n\nMost of the more expensive paintings in the first two auctions\nwere Philippine and Indonesian.\n\n\nAt the debut auction, a non-Filipino won over a local buyer after\nbringing up the price to nearly a million for an \" Amorsolo\n\" ( PDI Lifestyle ran a story on this last year).\n\n\nOf course it was too good to be true, and the transaction did not\npush through.\n\n\nBut the results as a whole were encouraging enough for Philippine\nartworks. \n\n \n\nThe second auction featured \" a Luna  boceto\n \" in his 1893 canvas, \" \"  Peuple\net Rois  ( People and Kings), &rdquo; \" for which there\nwere no takers.\n\n\nNevertheless some Philippine paintings in that auction were sold for\nrespectable prices. \n\n\n  New records  \n\n \n\nIn fact, Sotheby 's is a latecomer in the Philippine game.\n\n\nChristies ' took the lead years ago, when its Hong Kong branch put on\nthe block Charles Wirgman 's original drawings, engravings of which were\npublished in the London Illustrated News.\n\n\nWirgman had traveled extensively before settling in Japan, where he\nlived the rest of his life.\n\n\nHe sent back reports and illustrations to London, which were also\npublished by Harper 's in America. \n\n \n\nCollectors and institutions interested in material on the Middle\nEast, South Asia and Japan all bid for his watercolors and drawings, since it\nwas logical to try to obtain the whole set.\n\n\nA Filipino businessman outbid everyone else for those with Philippine\nsubjects, running up a bill of nearly &peso;30 million. \n\n \n\nThe prices fetched were considered so remarkable that the South\nChina Morning Post carried the auction on the front page the next day.\n\n\nThe next coup was again Christies ' .\n\n\nA Belgian who inherited a folio of watercolors brought it for\nevaluation to Sotheby 's, where an expert said it had little or no value.\n\n\nA dealer working for Christies ' recognized them as Philippine, and\nprobably worth a lot of money, based on the results of the Hong Kong auction.\n\n\n \n\nResearch later showed that the folio of watercolors of typical\nFilipinos in their usual style of dress, or   album de trajes\n  , was by the 9th-century Manila artist Jose Lozano.\n\n\nThe set was sold to a Filipino for about &peso; 12 million. \n\n \n\nSome months before, a private museum foundation bought a Lozano\nsketchbook for &peso;5 million. \n\n \n\nThe London houses ' recent auctions have featured such diverse\nFilipiniana as late 19th-century photographs; drawings by C. W. Andrews (\nalso published in 19th-century periodicals); maps of the Philippines and the\nregion; a set of Father Blanco 's \" \"  Flora de\nFilipinas  . &rdquo; \" \n\n\n  Top prices  \n\n \n\nFor some years now, the San Francisco Auctioneers Butterfield and\nButterfield have been featuring Amorsolo paintings, some of which commanded\nprices unheard of in the last decade, found by luck in flea markets abroad,\nsold for nothing.\n\n\nIn the late 1960s, Teyet Pascual was able to buy Luna drawings for an\nindecently small amount of   pesetas   ; BenCab\ncould comb London for maps and prints even on his then not-considerable\nincome.\n\n\nIn America there were \" Amorsolos \" to be had for\nthe price of a meal. \n\n \n\nOf course, there were patricians like the late Don Eugenio Lopez,\nwho bought Filipino masterworks for his museum and foundation, paying good\nmoney.\n\n\nBut Spain then was not one of the richer nations in Europe, and rich\nFilipinos were rich. \n\n \n\nThe Marcos era was a dark period for Philippine art.\n\n\nGood pieces were dumped by families fleeing persecution and economic\nuncertainty.\n\n\nPrices plunged from the 1970s, and recovered somewhat only from 1980,\nwhen the Intramuros Administration and the Central Bank were buying. \n\n \n\nA massive unloading occurred again after the Aquino slaying, when\nunease drove upper-class Filipinos to emigrate.\n\n\nPrices did not plunge, since the pieces being sold were top quality,\nand sellers and buyers acknowledged that one was not compelled to sell, and\nthe other wanted to buy. \n\n \n\nThe prices started climbing up again after 1986, but in fits and\nstarts.\n\n\nUntil well into the ' 90s increments were steady, but modest. \n\n \n\nToday, the prices being quoted are awesome.\n\n\nA bond paper-size \" Amorsolo \" for around half a\nmillion.\n\n\nA 24 x 36-inch one is cheap at &peso;1.5 million and may reach\n&peso;4 million.\n\n\n\" Manansalas \" are around the same price. \n\n\n  Seller 's market  \n\n \n\nThe trade in \" \" vintage art &rdquo; \" - -\npieces by deceased masters and early works by living painters - - has been\nquite lucrative over the last five years.\n\n\nPascual explained the logic of it once, in the darkest days after the\nAquino slay: first, the population of the Philippines was ever-increasing;\nsecond, the economy would have to stop going downhill at some point, and then\nstart going up; third, as the economy improved, the rich would put part of\ntheir wealth in art holdings; and fourth, the quantity of good Philippine art\nwas a constant, and this number would be depleted slowly by accidental damage\nor destruction.\n\n\nTherefore, he insisted, at some point the prices of Philippine art\nwould go up. \n\n \n\nWe have reached that point where there is more demand than\nsupply, and the prices have been going up dramatically.\n\n\nThere are hardly any master paintings available now in the country,\nso they are being sought abroad. \n\n \n\nThe dream deal was that of art dealer Eva Florentino who some\nyears ago located the Andres Luna de San Pedro hoard of paintings in the US.\n\n\nThe paintings were bought for tens of millions of pesos by the Far\nEast Bank, which donated part of the collection to the National Museum. \n\n \n\nA Filipino dealer has been locating paintings abroad by\nadvertising in newspapers and art publications ( such as \"\nConnoisseur \" , \" Art at Auction \" ) in Spain,\nEngland and America.\n\n\nHe has been cruising auction houses and casting his nets far and\nwide.\n\n\nHe has become so successful that an American dealer in Honolulu and\nanother in California have tried to emulate him. \n\n \n\nA Filipino diplomat in a European capital has been able to build\na personal collection by also dealing in paintings, sculptures and prints\nfound in the cities where he had been posted. \n\n \n\nIn the Philippines, art galleries have proliferated and new art\ndealers have entered the market, like ants attracted to a picnic.\n\n\nThe \" Artwalk \" at Megamall in Mandaluyong has\nemerged as the \" Mabini \" of the late 20th century,\nshowcasing Philippine art as commodity. \n\n \n\nA not-so-young ex  guru  left off his attempts\nat establishing his own religion, in the belief that selling art would be\neasier than convincing disbelievers that tithing is good for the soul. \n\n \n\nSeveral women   de buena familia   ,\nrealizing that they have to work to eat, have decided that they would deal in\nart, which would sound better than selling insurance or memorial plans. \n\n\n  Art as commodity  \n\n \n\nThree reasons may be cited for buying art.\n\n\nFirst is its outright use - - that is, as artifact, which has use and\nmeaning.\n\n\nSecond, they are status symbols.\n\n\nThe third - - and the worse reason - - is that their prices are\nexpected to go up. \n\n \n\nStone Age men painting and scratching out figures and designs on\ncave walls are no different from today 's businessmen seeking to enhance\ntheir surroundings by buying and hanging art on their walls.\n\n\nArt is full of meaning and is, first of all, a property of rituals.\n\n\n \n\nShow me your paintings and I 'll tell you who you are.\n\n\nFor example there is a high probability of   retokado\n  women, who are into ballroom dancing, having those stickily\npastel mother-and-child paintings. \n\n \n\nThe kind of art you have around you speaks of your state of mind;\nyour past, present and future; the kind of friends you have; your income, and\ntherefore, your lifestyle. \n\n \n\nWhile Filipinos are very individualistic, they are, nevertheless,\naware of status symbols.\n\n\nOf course having a \" Lao Lianben \" is different from\nhaving a \" Phyllis Zaballero \" .\n\n\n\" Lao \" is monochromatic, subtle, profound.\n\n\nBut above all one sees the works of Lao hanging on the walls of the\ncountry 's most successful young men and women.\n\n\nA \" Lao \" , therefore, sets the owner apart,\nindicates that he does business with or goes to the homes of the quietly rich\n intelligentsia  .\n\n\nThat he is one of them. \n\n \n\nThe worse reason for buying art is speculation.\n\n\nAn artwork is often, but should not be treated, simply as a commodity\nwith future.\n\n\nBuying a painting appears to be as uncomplicated as buying shares of\nstock.\n\n\nBut the fact is that both transactions are not that simple.\n\n\nIf you don't know what you 're doing, don't do it. \n\n\n  Knowing  \n\n \n\nThere are some keys points in buying art. \n\n \n\nThe first problem is that there are no published prices.\n\n\nOne expert evaluates paintings by the square inch which is\nridiculous.\n\n\nArt cannot be treated like meat selling by the kilo.\n\n\nPrices may be determined based on the most recent transactions, based\non  quality  not size. \n\n \n\nThe second problem is quality.\n\n\nHow does one know which painting is good, and which isn't?\n\n\nIn the case of works by artists who have passed away there is a third\ndimension, authenticity.\n\n\nHow can one be sure that the signature is genuine? \n\n \n\nThis is where dealers and experts come in.\n\n\nThe most successful dealers actually aim not for the highest, but for\n\" handshake &rdquo; prices.\n\n\nThese are prices where the seller is glad enough to let go, and the\nbuyer happy enough to pay. \n\n \n\nGallery owners usually try to maintain prices, not selling too\nlow, but not asking too high.\n\n\nOn this matter, the few experts who are not dealers cannot really\nhave much to say, since they cannot possibly keep track of transactions. \n\n \n\nThe art dealer is expected to be an expert on quality as well as\nauthenticity.\n\n\nThe problem is that some buyers begrudge dealers their commissions\nor profits, thinking they would get better deals buying directly from artists\nor previous owners. \n\n \n\nBut that is not necessarily so.\n\n\nDealers have reputations to maintain, and try to make sure about\nauthenticity. \n\n \n\nNevertheless, there are buyers who insist on having an\nauthentication document.\n\n\nThe Ayala Museum had such a service, although they had some problems\nwith the process, and decided to discontinue it. \n\n \n\nThere are some individuals who used to issue documents, but\ntheir signatures were associated with patently fake works. \n\n \n\nRod. Paras Perez 's Asean Art Institute does authentications,\nsometimes running in contrast with the Authentication Panel of the National\nMuseum.\n\n\nThe latter institution constituted a three-member panel which meets\nregularly to deliberate on artworks brought before it. \n\n \n\nAs they say, where there 's arguing, there 's money.\n\n\nWith prices of art going up as they have, blood pressures are\nexpected to shoot up.\n\n\nThere are accusations and counter-accusations strewn with peso\nsigns, signs of ignorance, false assumptions, bruised egos and, here and\nthere, a few gems of insight. \n\n\n  Collecting  \n\n \n\nOnly the young and the new collectors are alarmed.\n\n\nThe old hands chuckle, cajole, and even inflame those who are, at a\ngiven moment, the principal characters in the drama of Manila 's art world.\n\n\n \n\nThe fact is that any one who collects art or even buys a single\npainting must rely only on one person 's judgment: His own. \n\n \n\nThe same goes for antiques.\n\n\nIf you will buy an altar table, an ivory   santo \n , a cabinet or whatever, no one can tell you if you should buy it\nor not. \n\n \n\nThe true art collector is a  connoisseur  , a\nword which derives from the French \"   connaitre \n \" and the Latin \"   cognoscere \n \" .\n\n\nTaste proceeds only from knowledge.\n\n\nThe connoisseur  knows  , and above all  lives\n with art. \n\n \n\nHow does one become a  connoisseur  ? \n\n \n\nFirst, one must be educated, not necessarily in school, but from\nbooks and knowledgeable people. \n\n \n\nSecond, one must move in the right circle.\n\n\nThis means knowing the right collectors, dealers, experts. \n\n \n\nAnd third, one must be self-motivated.\n\n\nYou must like art and live it. \n\n \n\nArt and antiques are part of a lifestyle.\n\n\nIf you have pre-Hispanic gold jewelry, they 're real, just as your\ndiamonds are.\n\n\nIf you have sterling silver service and flatware, that means you\nhave the servants to clean them.\n\n\nIf you have old   kamagong   chairs, your\ndining table can't be made of plywood.\n\n\nIf you have an Albor, you have friends who won't think the house\npainter botched up your wall.\n\n\nIf you have a Luna, you know it really is one, no matter if some\nexpert thinks it 's not. \n\n \n\nAbove all, if you want to buy a piece of art, you 'll buy it,\neven if there are those who say it 's too expensive and you can't sell it\nexcept at a loss this afternoon.\n\n\nYou know it 's good, it 's real, you want it. \n\n \n\nAnd you can afford it.\n\n\nSo there.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "e8bdf097-a565-4f90-bb90-3b830cf53cf1", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.224297+00:00"}
{"text": "Spanish experts show what art restoration really is \n\n\n\n Lito B. Zulueta \n\n \n\nTHE LOCAL art conservation movement has received a modest boost\nwith the recent visit of two Spanish experts from the \" \nCurator Conservacion Restauracion de Madrid  \" , the\nhighly respected institute making forays into restoration and conservation in\ndeveloping countries like the Philippines. \n\n \n\nStarting Sept. 1, Maria Hita Bojahar and Emilio Mezcua Santamaria\nconducted an intensive, hands-on seminar-workshop on painting and polychrome\nrestoration and conservation at the College of Architecture and Fine Arts (\nCafa) of the University of Santo Tomas. \n\n \n\nBrought here through the initiative of Fr. Isidro Abano, O.P., the\nCafa regent and director of the UST Museum of Arts and Sciences, the two\nSpaniards had been so moved by the enthusiastic response of Cafa professors\nand students that they extended the five-day course up to last week. \n\n \n\nParticipants received a certificate from the institute that would\nvouch for their having mastered the rudiments of restoration and\nconservation, enough for them to pass on the knowledge to others.\n\n\n( Father Abano and Cafa Dean Yolanda Reyes are strengthening the\nrestoration and conservation component of the fine arts curriculum of UST;\nmoreover, the former has recommended to the UST Office of Academic Affairs\nand the UST Graduate School the introduction of a Diplomate on Museology to\nprofessionalize museum personnel in the Philippines). \n\n \n\nThe importance of the seminar-workshop cannot be underestimated.\n\n\nWhile museums and art faculties have to send only their most select\nmen to Europe to take part in one-month certificate courses in restoration\nand conservation, often at costs that put further pressure on already taxed\nbudgets, the UST initiative - - of importing experts to do the training here\nwith larger classes - - was brilliant and cost-efficient.\n\n\nIt also \" localized &rdquo; European methods of restoration and\nmade them more responsive to Philippine needs. \n\n \n\nAt the UST workshop, in fact, professors and students applied\nwhat they had learned from Bojahar and Santamaria 's lectures by restoring\nitems from the famed UST Museum collection.\n\n\nUnder the guidance of the two Spanish experts, the participants\nchecked the flaky outgrowth in two Botong Francisco paintings, tidied up\nFelix Resurrection Hidalgo 's \" \"  Costas de Normandia\n , &rdquo; \" removed the coastal shelf of dirt and mold\nfrom an 18th-century portrait of a UST rector  magnificus \nof that era, and cleaned and trimmed the twisted horse mane that passed off\nfor hair of a   santo   mildewed by the\ncenturies. \n\n \n\nThe restored works were later put up in an exhibit at the UST\nMuseum that was formally opened on Sept. 8 by Ignacio Cabria, the chancellor\nof the Spanish Embassy, and Angelita Cruz, wife of construction magnate F. F.\nCruz.\n\n\nThe show runs until Sept. 22. \n\n \n\nThrough restoration, UST fine arts professors were able to\ndiscover certain things.\n\n\nProf. Jaime de los Santos said that canvases used in the 18th and\n19th centuries appeared more built to last, while those of the 20th century\nwere ephemeral.\n\n\n \" It reveals the   pwede-na  \nmentality of the 20th century, \"  he rued.\n\n\nProf. Rhoda Recto learned that she has to mix consistently her paint\nnext time she takes up her brush in order to ensure that her canvas will\nlast. \n\n\n  Restoration tips  \n\n \n\nThe restoration was no easy matter.\n\n\n \" This work does not require you to hurry, you must do\nit patiently, &rdquo;  the two experts told the participants.\n\n\nIn fact, the reason the seminar-workshop lasted up to last week was\nbecause the process was often painstaking and careful. \n\n \n\n \" We 're trying to cram a process that we have\nlearned and mastered in 15 years in just five days, &rdquo;  the two\ncomplained during the workshop.\n\n\nThat, and the enthusiasm of Bojahar and Santamaria to share their\nknowledge with the equally eager participants. \n\n \n\nIn fact, Father Abano expressed surprise that the Madrid duo had\nbeen so generous in sharing their expertise, even revealing certain trade\nsecrets.\n\n\nIn Italy, where Abano specialized on sacred art and the church 's\ncultural patrimony, one-month certificate courses on restoration usually\nscrimp on revelations.\n\n\nIn contrast, his Spanish guests had been  \" unselfish\nand really eager to be of help.\"  \n\n \n\nBojahar and Santamaria 's generosity can be better appreciated if\none considers that they mastered their discipline after much difficulty and\nsacrifice.\n\n\nThe two came from diverse though not antipodal backgrounds. \n\n \n\nBojahar earned her diplomate on easel restoration at the\n\"  Escuela Superior de Conservacion y Restauracion de Madrid\n \" , where she also got a second diplomate on book\nrestoration.\n\n\nShe also specialized in molding and excavation at the \"\n Escuela de Artes y Oficios  \" . \n\n \n\nSantamaria, on the other hand, is a senior industrial engineer.\n\n\nHe has since worked as a partner and technical assistant to Bojahar\nin the restoration and conservation of organic materials, devising the\nlaboratory processes and the analytical proofs for the work. \n\n \n\nIn 1985, the two were commissioned by the \" \nMuseo de America de Madrid  \" to restore Indian basket and\nleather artifacts from Spain 's  conquistador  days in the\nAmericas.\n\n\nBut the work was made doubly hard by the lack of published materials\non the artifacts: without any working knowledge of them in their original\nform, they did not have any rudimentary conception of the scope of the\nrestoration. \n\n \n\nThe partners had to operate by taking short and careful but\nhighly experimental steps.\n\n\nAs a result, it took them three months to restore two meters of\nbuffalo hide with ceremonial paintings on them by the plains Indians of North\nAmerica. \n\n \n\nBy persistence, imagination and experimentation, the two were\nable to develop chemicals and certain approaches to restoration.\n\n\n \" We encountered problems that were common and thereby\ndevised measures to deal with them, &rdquo;  they say. \n\n \n\nTheir hard work paid off.\n\n\nAt the 1994 Brussels Fair of International Inventors, Bojahar won the\n\"  Premio Eureka  ( Gold Medal) \" and a\n\" Special Jury Mention \" for her \" \" \n Metodo para el tratamiento de la recuperacion de las pieles \n \" . &rdquo; \n\n\n  Care and discernment  \n\n \n\nThe approach included the use of restoration creams and drugs\nthat she and Santamaria concocted.\n\n\nShe also got a special award for the same method from the chamber of\ninventors of Spain. \n\n \n\n \" Our innovative products are nontoxic, they 're\nnot acidic, &rdquo;  Santamaria said.\n\n\n \" They do not affect adversely the original work.\n\n\nThey allow, for instance, for the removal of dirt from a painting or\nsculpture without affecting the varnish or original color.\n\n\nThey leave the work as they are. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nAlthough \"  Curator  \" claims\nspecial expertise with ethnographic materials, it also has mastery of\npainting and polychrome, as well as document restoration.\n\n\nRecently, they restored the original  magna carta \nof Costa Rica ( at one time during the UST seminar, an official of the Manila\nArchdiocesan Archives dropped by to get some tips on conserving the local\nchurch 's ancient manuscripts). \n\n \n\nAfter their Philippine stint, they will go back to Spain to\nresume a work commissioned by the University of Alcala to restore 2,000\nancient fans, including oriental fans, as well as reconstruct the old tiles\nof the floor of the grand hall of the antique center of learning. \n\n \n\nAsked if there 's a unique \"  Curator \n\" technique, &rdquo; \" they insisted that what is required of\nany restorer and conservator are care and discernment.\n\n\n \" \"  Curator  \"\ntries to determine what is really the nature of a work and only then\ndetermine what method to use, &rdquo;  they explained. \n\n \n\nRestoration, Bojahar and Santamaria insisted, should follow the\nbasic principle of \" reversibility. &rdquo;\n\n\nThis means that any restoration work must have the makings of its own\nundoing to give way to an approach that can better fashion the original\nlineaments of a work.\n\n\n \" Nothing should be final with restoration, &rdquo;\n they say.\n\n\n \" Everything should be reversible. &rdquo; \n\n\n \n\nIn the UST workshop, for instance, watercolor was used to restore\ncertain damaged portions of Botong Francisco 's \" \" \nHarana  \" . &rdquo;\n\n\nShould the color used be proven later to be not faithful to the\nmaster 's original spirit, then it could be removed. \n\n \n\nAs an example of good restoration, the two Spaniards praised the\nwork done on the Sistine Chapel.\n\n\nAccording to them, the restoration yielded the original colors of\nMichelangelo: \"   el color limpio   ,\n&rdquo; that is, clear, bright and pristine.\n\n\nIn the process, they say, Michelangelo 's dramatic and colossal\nfigures came out. \n\n\n  Complex and elaborate  \n\n \n\nBut restoration, they said, is complex and elaborate. \n\n \n\nAt the UST workshop, the restoration of G. Cordero 's 1941\n\" \" The Philippine  Angelus  \"\n\" - - its big canvas having suffered from poor storage and\ninsect-infestation - - was made doubly difficult by the rough brush strokes\nof the painter that deeply ingrained the dirt that had accumulated through\nthe decades. \n\n \n\nEven the cotton used to initially wipe the dirt off was caught in\nthe canvas and had to be removed by a special emulsion.\n\n\nSome of the dirt appeared to be a cloud of white dust that was\ndetected by ultraviolet rays trained by the Spanish experts. \n\n \n\nAside from cotton, the participants used a double brush to gently\nwipe the canvas.\n\n\nThe cleaning used special \"  Curator \n\" creams and concoctions.\n\n\nThen animal glue brewed in a special manner by \" \nCurator  \" was applied to the work - - or portions of it\nthat needed repair or reconstruction - - and then covered with special\ncellulose paper ( onion skin and   papel de japon \n were good substitutes). \n\n \n\nThe work was left to dry for 24 hours.\n\n\nAfterward, tepid water was used to remove the cellulose, and the\nfinal work was a work restored to much of its original sheen.\n\n\nSome portions was left unrestored for instruction purposes. \n\n \n\nThe same process more or less was observed in restoring Botong\nFrancisco 's \" \" Give Us This Day &rdquo; \" .\n\n\nTo check for flaking, parts of it were applied with animal glue then\noverlaid with onion skin.\n\n\nThe paper was then ironed to the canvas with a small soldering iron\nof 30 watts.\n\n\nDamp water was then applied to remove the paper and \" Oleo\n\" , a special \"  Curator  \"\ncream, to dislodge dirt and dust, yielding Botong 's brilliant colors and\nprovoking the class of wannabe restorers and conservators to cheers of\ntriumph, joyous as they were at every small victory achieved over the talons,\nof time, neglect, dirt and desuetude. \n\n \n\nSuch small victories should be repeated elsewhere - - in our\nother vanishing works of artistic, cultural and historical patrimony.\n\n\nThe work won't be easy, warned Bojahar and Santamaria.\n\n\nFor one, there 's the lack of awareness.\n\n\nIn fact, they said the European conservation movement is relatively\nyoung - - only in the last 40 years or so has it gained headway.\n\n\nEven then, the consciousness of the need to conserve the decaying\nhallmarks of western civilization had been forming earlier, although it\nyielded concrete fruits only later.\n\n\nThat consciousness still needs to be evolved in the Philippines. \n\n \n\nBut while evolution takes time, patrimonial disintegration has\nbeen radical and fast.\n\n\nThat is especially true of the Philippines, according to Bojahar and\nSantamaria, because it is a tropical country.\n\n\nAs a rule, they say, excessive temperatures and extreme humidity and\ndryness are unkind to documents and artifacts.\n\n\nAdding to the nemeses of our cultural artifacts are bugs, moths,\nfungi and pollution.\n\n\nThus, the enemies of our patrimony are both man-made and natural.\n\n\n \n\nBut even nature 's punishments can be tamed by effective man-made\ninterventions.\n\n\nAlthough Bojahar and Santamaria admit that lack of money is\nproblematic for any conservation campaign, a government worth its salt and\nmindful of the national interest should make restoration and conservation a\npriority.\n\n\nThey suggest the creation of a \" National Institute for\nRestoration and Conservation \" to foster a healthy consciousness\namong the populace to preserve the showcases of their civilization, as well\nas competently deal with the challenges of conservation. \n\n \n\nInitially, they say, a country trying to put into work a viable\nconservation establishment needs to hire or import experts to teach its\npeople the ropes.\n\n\nBut the end-view should be the formation of   el pais\n  - - that is, a professional core of locals who can do the\nrestoration themselves. \n\n \n\nIn that case, the UST workshop is significant.\n\n\nBy coming here, like Magellan and the missionaries, from the other\nside of the globe to teach Filipinos highly prized techniques of restoration\nand conservation, Bojahar and Santamaria laid the groundwork for a truly\nnative and Filipino cultural conservation movement that will preserve for\nposterity the hallmarks of its civilization, a civilization which,\nincidentally, got its soul from Spain.\n\n\nWith the visit of \"  Curator  \" ,\nthe Philippines and Spain have entered a new chapter in their colorful\nrelationship.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "44ae21ee-8d78-4730-98f6-74b176b4581f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.225487+00:00"}
{"text": "Celebrating Easter Sunday  \n\n\n Emy V. I&ntilde;iguez \n\n \n\nAs the Holy Week comes to an end, a joyful celebration\ncommemorates the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n\n\nEvery member of the Christian faith looks forward to this celebration\nwhich is the culmination of the Passion of our Lord.\n\n\nObserved in all Christian Churches, this holy day is considered a very\nimportant one. \n\n \n\nThe date of Easter Sunday varies every year.\n\n\nIt is usually celebrated on the first Sunday after the full moon which\noccurs on or next after March 21 and is therefore celebrated between March 22\nand April 25 inclusive.\n\n\nThis date was fixed by the Council of Nicaea in A.D. 325. \n\n \n\nAn example of celebrations during Easter is the Russian\ncelebrations during the 1700s.\n\n\nIt was kind of a prolonged Easter week and preparations began as\nearly as late January or February, in the depths of the Russian winter with\nits deep snow.\n\n\nEight weeks before Easter Sunday, a week of carnival known as\n\" Butter Week \" began.\n\n\nEverybody ate huge amounts of food.\n\n\n  Blini   , a special small pancake\nsoaked in butter, was given and eaten all throughout the carnival week.\n\n\nThis food was symbolic of the sun, lovely days and happy marriages.\n\n\nLemon and Latvian  vodka  accompany this\nspecialty. \n\n \n\nAlso during carnival week, masked figures ran through streets\nwhere actors and dancing bears entertained the crowd.\n\n\nSchools and public offices were closed towards the end of the week.\n\n\nThe last day of the carnival week was when the Great Fast (\nseven-week penance) began.\n\n\nPeople eat only fish, mushroom, vegetables and coffee.\n\n\nMeat, milk, butter, sugar and eggs were forbidden.\n\n\nIn Easter Week the fast ends and people celebrate with more feasting:\ndominated by decorating, giftgiving and eating of eggs. \n\n \n\nThe western world, particularly North America, introduced in the\nEast its own kind of Easter celebration.\n\n\nThe Easter egg-hunt is the activity that both young and old alike\nenjoy the best.\n\n\nThe rabbits and colorful eggs are but a couple of western Easter\nfigures. \n\n \n\nHere in the Philippines, there are a variety of names for the\nEaster celebrations in the provinces.\n\n\nThe Ibanags call it \"   Padafung  \n\" , Ilocanos, \"   Domingo  - \nSabet   \" .\n\n\nThe Pangasinenses know it as \"   Abet-abet \n \" , while the Cebuanos, Leytenos and Samarenos have always\nknown it as \"   Sugat   \" .\n\n\nAnd the Tagalogs call it the \"   Salubong \n \" .\n\n\nNo matter what we call it, the portrayal of the meeting of the Risen\nLord and His mother is still the focal point of Filipino Christian Easter\ncelebration. \n\n \n\nIn most Philippine Christian Churches, a huge four-poster roof is\nerected in preparation of the   Salubong   .\n\n\nBefore the crack of dawn on Easter Sunday, two processions leave the\nchurch.\n\n\nOne is the male procession of the risen Christ, carried by the men on\nan   andas   .\n\n\nIn front of the   andas   is a young man\ncarrying the long pole of the banner of   Agnus Dei \n .\n\n\nThe second is the female procession of the   Mater\nDolorosa   in mourning black with a veil covering the face.\n\n\nThey go through separate routes and eventually meet on the two sides\nof the roof for the   Salubong   . \n\n \n\nMeanwhile, little angels are positioned near the roof singing a\nglorious hymn, usually the \"   Regina Coeli Laetare\n  \" and the \"   Alleluia \n \" , and the principal angel is lowered from the roof to\nremove the mourning vestment of the Blessed Virgin.\n\n\nThe other angels shower the two   andas  \nwith flower petals.\n\n\nThe band then proceeds to play a festive march and both images are\nthen carried inside the Church, enthroned for 40 days in the altar, until the\nfeast of the Ascension.\n\n\nWhen the   andas   of Christ and Mary are\nfinally enthroned, the Easter Mass starts. \n\n \n\nVariations of the   Salubong   can be\nfound in the different places in the country.\n\n\nIn Gasan, Marinduque, the two processions separate in the church\npatio and not inside.\n\n\nIn Malolos, Bulacan, more images accompany the   andas\n  of the bereaved Mother of Christ like Sts. John and Peter,\nMary Magdalene, Veronica and other women in the Passion.\n\n\nIn Kamaligan, Albay, nine angels are lowered simultaneously with the\nprincipal angel to help in removing the Blessed Virgin 's mourning vestment.\n\n\nIn Baliwag town also in Bulacan, doves are released along with the\nopening of the huge flower that would shower the Virgin with fragrant flower\npetals. \n\n \n\nCelebrations of the Resurrection do not end on Easter Sunday.\n\n\nIn Pakil, Laguna, after Easter the   Nuestra\nSe&ntilde;ora de Dolores   or   Turumba \n is being honored with seven weekly feasts called \" \n lupi   \" .\n\n\n\"   Lupi   \" is the feast\nfor each of the seven daggers piercing the Virgin 's heart.\n\n\nDevotees from far and wide flock to Pakil to honor the Virgin and\nbathe in the \"   toromba   \" ( a\nwhite-tiled swimming pool) where the Virgin was seen to have bathed a long\ntime ago. \n\n \n\nThe commemoration of Christ 's resurrection is not confined to\ncelebrations just every Easter Sunday and the following days.\n\n\n\"   Retablos   \" are\n bas-relief  presentations of a certain religious event or\npersonage usually found in church altars.\n\n\nEaster pictures like Christ 's resurrection or the Blessed Virgin 's\nimage or other images of the women of Christ 's passion are sculpted\nmagnificently to help us remember the significance of Easter. \n\n \n\nThese are but some of the rituals that are observed during\nEaster.\n\n\nAnd whatever celebration people all around the world do, Easter\nSunday still remains as the joyful consummation of the solemn Holy Week. \n\n\n( References: Everyday Life through the Ages, Readers ' Digest\nPublishing Ltd., 1992; Filipino Heritage 7,  Lahing Pilipino \nPublication, 1978; and World Almanac 1992) \n\n\n\n\n  Philosophically speaking: What it means to be human\n \n\n\n Leovino Ma. Garcia \n\n \n\nLET ME warn you, dear reader, right away.\n\n\nThis article is, unashamedly, in praise of France.\n\n\nIn praise of Emmanuel Levinas, in particular - - the eminent\nFrench-Jewish philosopher who passed away at the age of ninety last December\n25, 1995.\n\n\nBut it is not because Levinas has interesting things to say on what\nit means to be French but because he has more interesting things to say on\nwhat it means to be human. \n\n \n\nLevinas is one among the many French philosophers whose writings\nhave been studied, commented and translated by several generations of\nteachers and students at the Ateneo de Manila University.\n\n\nIn the early sixties, the Philosophy department already offered\ncourses fully devoted to Descartes, Gabriel Marcel, Teilhard de Chardin,\nfollowed later by courses on Sartre, Camus, Merleau-Ponty, Ricoeur, Levinas,\nand more recently, Derrida and Foucault. \n\n \n\nThrough a \" loving struggle &rdquo; with the texts of these\nphilosophers, French philosophy has been able not only to survive but to\nthrive in Loyola Heights.\n\n\nHowever, the French thinking that has flourished is the kind that\nrespects and takes delight in differences.\n\n\nMost Ateneans like to think that they become more fully themselves,\nmore fully Filipino because they have been nourished by a certain \"\nFrench excellence &rdquo; in thinking.\n\n\nThis way of thinking is a thinking in praise of the Other.\n\n\nWhich brings us back to Emmanuel Levinas because he is  par\nexcellence  the philosopher of the Other, for the Other. \n\n\n  Law of the I and Law of the Other  \n\n \n\nWhat then has happened?\n\n\nAn \" earthquake &rdquo; occurred in contemporary philosophy\nbrought about by the publication in 1961 of Levinas ' major work entitled\n\" \" Totality and Infinity. &rdquo; \"\n\n\nThe \" \" I &rdquo; \" of modern philosophy which\nhas been placed at the center, at the summit of everything is dislodged,\ndecentered.\n\n\nInstead of a dominating \" I \" , there is a \"\nhumbled, wounded &rdquo; \" I \" .\n\n\nTo be fair, of course, this decentering of the \" I \"\nwas not single-handedly accomplished by Levinas.\n\n\nIt had also been prepared by the \" masters of suspicion &rdquo;\n- - the unholy trinity of Marx, Nietzsche and Freud. \n\n \n\nTo appreciate better this \" decentering, &rdquo; one will\nhave to recall here the famous distinction made by Levinas.\n\n\nAccording to him, there are two different ways of thinking or\nrelating designated by \" \" The Law of the I &rdquo; \"\nand \" \" The Law of the Other. &rdquo; \"\n\n\n\" \" The Law of the I &rdquo; \" is thinking\nthat starts from myself, goes out to the Other, and returns to myself.\n\n\nIn this perspective, the \" I \" is at the center.\n\n\nThe \" I \" reduces the other to itself.\n\n\nHere, the \" I \" is the Law.\n\n\n\" \" The Law of the Other &rdquo; \" is a\nthinking that moves from the \" I \" to the \" Other\n\" without returning to the \" I \" .\n\n\nIt is a way of thinking that abandons the familiar for the unknown.\n\n\nHere, the \" I \" is no longer the Law.\n\n\nThe \" Other \" is the Law.\n\n\nLevinas clarifies this difference between the \" Law of the I\n\" and the \" Law of the Other \" by evoking two\nfigures - - Ulysses and Abraham.\n\n\nThe \" Law of the I \" resembles the journey of\nUlysses.\n\n\nUlysses leaves his home in Ithaca but after all his wanderings,\nreturns home to Ithaca.\n\n\nIn contrast, the \" Law of the Other \" refers to\nAbraham who, obeying God 's command, leaves his home forever for an unknown\nland. \n\n\n Responsibility for the Other \n\n \n\nWhere does the \" Law of the I \" turn into the\n\" Law of the Other \" ?\n\n\nWhen does the decentering of the \" I \" occur?\n\n\nIt occurs in the \" Face to Face &rdquo; encounter.\n\n\nIt happens when I truly have an \" ethical &rdquo; experience,\nan experience of the Other as Other.\n\n\nWhen I meet and look at the Other, the Other manifests itself to me\nas a face who addresses me.\n\n\nUnlike a thing ( a stone or a dog), the Other 's Face in the strict\nsense cannot be objectified or classified.\n\n\nThe Other 's Face presents itself as radically new.\n\n\nThe Face teaches me that the Other is not only different but truly\nOther.\n\n\nThe Face teaches me that there exists a reality I cannot use or\nmanipulate.\n\n\nThere is a reality I must respect and serve. \n\n \n\nThis experience of radical otherness, this encounter of the Face\nto Face is the point of departure of the ethical relation.\n\n\nThe Face appears concretely as a command:  \" Do not\nkill! &rdquo;  Positively put, this command includes the plea to\npromote the Other as Other:  \" Please take care of me! &rdquo;\n  \" Take compassion on me. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThe Other 's Face is not only experienced as an irreducible\ncommand but also as a helpless misery.\n\n\nIn the biblical sense, the Other is literally the stranger, the\nwidow, the orphan.\n\n\nIt is precisely the other 's misery which makes the command ethical.\n\n\nAs command, the Other demands my recognition.\n\n\nBut as misery, the Other cannot compel me.\n\n\nThe Other can only plead with me.\n\n\nThe Other 's Face at the same time orders and begs me.\n\n\nTo sum up, the Face to Face experience is ethical because it is\nsimultaneously a command and a plea, a demanding and begging to which I\nrespond in freedom. \n\n \n\nResponsibility comes \" through the Other. &rdquo;\n\n\nThe Other, in silently addressing me, makes me uniquely responsible.\n\n\nWhat is most original in Levinas ' interpretation of\nresponsibility-for-the-Other is that I am not only responsible for what I do\nbut even for what I do not do.\n\n\nI am responsible for what does not even matter to me.\n\n\nWithout having chosen it, I am responsible for the Other.\n\n\nI am responsible for the Other without waiting for reciprocity.\n\n\nResponsibility then is essential to being human.\n\n\nResponsibility is not a luxury.\n\n\nTo be a human being, a \"  subject  \" for\nLevinas is to be responsible for the Other.\n\n\nIn this regard, Levinas cites many times a passage from Dostoyevsky 's\n\" \" The Brothers Karamazov &rdquo; \" :  \n\" We are all responsible for all, for all men before all, and I more\nthan all the others. &rdquo;   \n\n\n  From Knowledge-Power to Service  \n\n \n\nLevinas puts into question a whole philosophical tradition (\nfrom Plato to Heidegger) which he claims has reduced the Other in a view of\nphilosophy as knowledge-power.\n\n\nIn this view, knowledge is power over the Other.\n\n\nKnowledge consists in the manipulation or domination of the Other.\n\n\nAccording to Levinas, the \" totalitarian &rdquo; philosophies\nof the past have failed  \" to think the Other.\"  \n\n \n\nWhat Levinas proposes is a view of philosophy which puts itself\ninto question.\n\n\nHe is interested in the capacity of philosophy to question itself,\nto \" unsay &rdquo; itself.\n\n\nThe most remarkable thing about philosophy, for Levinas, is that it\nfails to comprehend or grasp everything.\n\n\nBut this failure is a blessing in disguise.\n\n\nFailing to absorb all meaning, philosophy remains open to the\nirreducible Other.\n\n\nFor Levinas, philosophizing is not a retreat into oneself but a\ngoing out to the Other. \n\n \n\nAt the root of Levinas ' philosophical interrogation, there is\nthe overwhelming astonishment that there is the Other.\n\n\nThis Other is Other!\n\n\nFrom this moment on, philosophy is no longer limited to a search for\nthe truth, my truth.\n\n\nPhilosophy turns from a \" love of wisdom &rdquo; into a\n\" wisdom of love &rdquo; understood as responsibility for the Other.\n\n\n \n\nIf philosophy wants to understand what it means to be human, it\nmust place itself \" in the service &rdquo; of the Other.\n\n\nThe philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas is unique in that it relates\nthought neither to  being  nor to the  true  but to the\n good  .\n\n\nAnd the good for Levinas is  \" the surplus of the\nimportance of the Other over myself. &rdquo; \n\n\nThe good is  \" answering for the Other. &rdquo;", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f85aa844-7cdc-4130-874b-059cbc733783", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.226623+00:00"}
{"text": "BenCab on the path of consistency  \n\n\n Reuben Ramas Ca&ntilde;ete \n\n \n\n\"   Larawan III   \" marks\nBenedicto Cabrera 's return to the theme that first made him a buzzword among\ncollectors and the art public: painted retakes of antique photographs,\nparticularly those taken at the turn of the century.\n\n\nThough some may quibble at the seeming banality of the act, such a\npainterly practice is, in fact, quite an accepted norm in the artworld\nmainstream.\n\n\nArtists have been consciously reproducing photographs as paintings\nsince the 1950s, when Irish artist Francis Bacon took Edward Muybridge 's\nmultiple-exposure shots, taken in the 1870s, and transformed them into\nbrutalized images that conveyed the  angst  - ridden\nsensibilities of contemporary European existence. \n\n \n\nAnother development was that of the American Photo-Realists like\nMalcolm Morely, Chuck Close and Richard Estes, who rendered the full banality\nof everyday life in huge paintings derived from photographs projected onto\nthe canvas ( the easier to paint it, my dear).\n\n\nOf the two currents, it is Bacon 's that is relevant, for he is one\nfigure ( though not the only one) in the development of BenCab, who lived in\nLondon between 1968-1972, and again from 1974-'88, minus the paranoia and\nself-doubt, of course. \n\n \n\nFor what distinguishes the Westerner 's approach to the photograph\nas subject matter in painting from the Filipino is that the former treats it\nas a sledgehammer with which to bludgeon the audience into an abyss of\nhistorical guilt, apathy and cynicism; while the latter rejoices over its\npower as faded but mystical mirror, refracting the sense of continuity of\nBeing, and the pride of depicting the Self, especially in lieu of the\nhistorical circumstances of colonialism, and foreign dominance over the\nindigenous body and mind.\n\n\nIt is this power of recall that draws us to look at the past, mixed\nwith a tinge of sentiment and regret, looking for it among the few material\nobjects that survived the vicissitudes of the past 90 years; and to search\nfor it among those of us who have dedicated their lives to unearthing and\nreinterpreting it. \n\n \n\nBenCab 's show of 20 paintings, recently at the Luz Gallery\nbefore it makes its American debut at Martha 's Vineyard this September,\nproves that some of us have been there far longer than the rest.\n\n\nThis does not, in any way, disabuse BenCab 's ability to render\ncontemporary life.\n\n\nFrom his various prints and watercolors of Filipinos, whether as\nstreetwise urbanites ( 1974); overseas workers and scholars ( 1978); victims\nof natural calamities ( 1990); or as languid musicians ( 1995), BenCab proves\nhe can dish out modern life with both gusto and sensitivity.\n\n\nBut it is his series of \" antique Filipinos &rdquo; that has\nendeared him most to his public. \n\n \n\nThe historical connection came early when, as a student in UP, he\nwas asked to do \" Rizal \" from a drawing made by Pedro\nConiconde.\n\n\nLater, while working as an illustrator for  Sunday Times Magazine\n , he followed the wanderings of a vagrant madwoman, Sabel, along his\nold home in Bambang Street, sketching her into a style of pen drafting.\n\n\nThese early forays into social commentary ( never fully acknowledged\nby the ideological ranks of the Social Realists) were tempered by his greater\ninterest in form and composition, juxtaposing the exhaustively detailed human\nfigure in a neatly defined rectangular empty space, a compositional device\nthat would recur throughout his whole career. \n\n \n\nThe test of artistic immortality came in his first London stay,\nwhen he started his collection of old Philippine prints, photographs and\nmaps, from which he would cull images of Filipinos subjugated and \"\nposed &rdquo; under the watchful eyes of white colonizers and military\nphotographers.\n\n\nEven before \" Post-Modernism \" became an abused art\nterm, \" \"   Larawan   \"\n\" ( 1972) was an exhibit that opened  Manile&ntilde;os\n to vast vistas, as images of the past now served as artistic\ndevices of contemporary artmaking, breaking the dichotomy between abstraction\nand figurative art in a way impossible to do at home at that time, but almost\nsecond nature to expatriates yearning to reassert their identity in a\nforeign, uncaring land. \n\n \n\nBenCab has never looked back, though to break the monotony, he\nhas enlarged his scope to include images of city dwellers, fellow artists,\nand urban voyeurs as varied as London punks and Manila   kanto\n  boys.\n\n\n\"  \"  Larawan  III &rdquo; \n\" not only marks the third installment of a theme BenCab has\nexplored for the past 26 years, but also recapitulates the image of the\nFilipina Woman as the Othered, an imagery that has been building up since his\n\" \" Sabel &rdquo; \" series until last year 's\n\" \" Mysterious Woman &rdquo; \" series. \n\n \n\nThe format has undergone dramatic changes.\n\n\nIn the ' 70s, dour, thinly-painted  sepias  were the norm,\nin keeping with the \" reproduced antique photo &rdquo; look.\n\n\nNow, brilliant blues battle it out with chrome yellows, vermillions\nand sienna browns.\n\n\nHis trademark gestural flicks of complementary color across the\nbackground bordering the figure has also stabilized into a heavier line.\n\n\nAnd the women are rendered with the weight and voluptuousness of\nEuropean Old Masters, like Michelangelo or Rubens. \n\n \n\nNewer techniques, courtesy of acrylic paint, also inhabit the\ncanvas surface, such as grainy paint of a lighter or darker color overlaying\na bright color like scarlet, done by mixing the flat-drying acrylic with gel\nand using a paint roller to apply the overlayer.\n\n\nBenCab then adds further texture by scratching or combing across the\nwet paint, producing rhythmic lines that accent the composition from afar.\n\n\nThe effort has resulted in some of the best figure paintings BenCab\nhas shown since the early 1990s, when his return to drawing emphasized linear\nrather than painterly development. \n\n \n\n\" \" Arm Akimbo &rdquo; \" reflects his\nformula well.\n\n\nThe wary woman with the partly-cropped head ( another BenCab device)\nglares at an intruder on her left, her undone left sleeve both an indicator\nof power ( seduction, the native disrobing her colonial \" shackles,\n&rdquo; etc.), and of vulnerability. \n\n \n\nIn \" \" The Gaze, &rdquo; \" two squatting\nwomen turn their attention to the viewer, a mixture of wariness, defiance and\nimpenetrability fleeting through their faces.\n\n\nThis painting marks a distinct usage of drip-paint technique that\nheightens the effect of artificiality, and also produces such exquisite\nbackground tonality as that found in \" \"   Tampipi\n  . &rdquo; \"\n\n\nHere, the visual dialogue between faithfully-painted woman vendor,\nbackground-foreground and gestural strokes is so distinctly sharpened and\nstarkly balanced, it could be construed as one of BenCab 's color etching\nprints, enlarged and repainted. \n\n \n\n\" \" Monsoon Season &rdquo; \" brings us\nback into an approximation of \" straightforward painting, &rdquo; where\nthe subject matter of woman with child in knee-deep floods dominates the\nwhole canvas, liberated from extraneous compositional encumbrances, but\nnonetheless declares its liberation from the illusion of perspective.\n\n\nThis piece also comes closest to the 1972 series, in its sparse use\nof color.\n\n\n\" \" Fruit Vendor &rdquo; \" approaches the same\nformat.\n\n\nHowever, the background reverie of red glazes over blue underpaint\nennobles its precocious, long-dead figure into a spirit guide-like\nincarnation.\n\n\nSome works belie the art historical processing that goes on behind\nthe scenes.\n\n\n\" \" The Huntress &rdquo; \" is posed with the\ncasual aplomb of a Baroque Diana transposed into the tropics, circa 1890s.\n\n\nAnd the purposefully stiff pose of \" \" Woman with\nBasket &rdquo; \" is as much a tribute to Manet ( with unfinished\nfoliage to boot) as it is an accurate assessment in rendering a photo shoot\nwith a slow-fixing, cumbersome daguerrotype camera. \n\n \n\nSome cynics have argued that BenCab has gone dry, unable to\nreinvent himself to an audience that is rumored to be sick of the past.\n\n\nThis, no doubt, is a result of the purgative overdose of\nCentennialist hoopla that the nation went through recently.\n\n\nIn hindsight, though, there is no need to worry, either about BenCab\nor the Filipino audience.\n\n\nIf consistency is the way towards artistic righteousness, then he has\nbeaten a path way before anyone else in his generation, or those half his\nage, could. \n\n \n\nGangly and quick-moving for a 56-year-old, BenCab has aesthetic\nadmirers far from the multi-millionaires that snap up his pictures: middle\nclass yuppies who are rediscovering our tortured history; antiquarians and\nhistory buffs of all classes; or real art connoisseurs who look for both\nsubstance and well-done formal flair.\n\n\nBut perhaps the most poignant are the farmers or factory workers who\nhang calendar photo reproductions of \" \"   Ang Tao\n  \" \" ( 1972) in their huts. \n\n \n\nIt is to them that BenCab 's imagery strikes the deepest chords,\nfor entirely different reasons.\n\n\nBeyond the banality of art hustling, resonations like these are hard\nto beat.  \n\n\n\n\n  Impy Pilapil: Searching and finding  \n\n\n Reuben Ramas Ca&ntidle;ete \n\n \n\nLike mystical monoliths, the recent sculptural pieces of renowned\nartist Imelda \" Impy &rdquo; Pilapil beckon to the viewer like\nindecipherable monuments to the achievement of \" ( Wo)man as Builder\n\" : strangely elegant, towering masses of marble, at times chipped;\nand at others, polished to a radiant sheen that captures the imagery around\nit, focusing it into what the Japanese call the \"   chi\n  \" , the soul, of the rock. \n\n \n\nA recent, more restrained ( nay, classical, even) phase in the\nartist 's career, Impy 's stone sculptures have mystified and enthralled\naudiences since its first major introduction two years ago.\n\n\nBack then, her starkly monolithic pieces of black and cream-white\nmarble evoked comparisons with Isamu Noguchi 's  Zen  -\nlike sculptural creations, with their rough-versus-smooth surface texturing,\nthe combination of grey, black-veined and white-colored stone, and the\nallusions to contemplative meditation and sudden enlightenment, like\ncontemporary incantations of the famed boulders at the rock garden of\n Ryoanji Temple  in Kyoto. \n\n \n\nWe have once again been allowed the privilege of seeing a\nrefinement of Impy 's aesthetic meditations in a new series, called \"\n\" Find Your Truth. &rdquo; \"\n\n\nTo be mounted at the Luz Gallery in Makati from June 25 to July 14,\nImpy 's new pieces are both pensive and mythical: the former, due to its\ninherent respect for the otherwise unforgiving medium of marble, resulting in\nsleek, vertically-oriented pieces that lead the eye heaven-ward ( and hence,\ninducing one into a subconscious state of contemplation, bereft of the\ndistractions that flailing arms, flowing drapery pose and diagonal details\npose that make representational sculpture so \" noisy\"); the latter,\nbecause of Impy 's masterful re-integration of a design motif that has\nendeared her to her audiences, \" the Wave \" .\n\n\nThis unmistakable motif, undulating gently across the mass of piled\nmarble slabs that actually constitute the building blocks of each piece ( so\nthat it can be easily dismantled and moved into place), is Impy 's own to\nclaim. \n\n \n\n\" The Wave \" strikes a deep chord among us\nFilipinos.\n\n\nIt stirs the deepest of collective memories: of distant ancestors\nreaching the far shores of their destiny aboard wooden boats that glided\nacross the glassy but sometimes terrifying rough seas that marked the outer\nperimeters of the  Sri Vijaya Empire  ; of childhood\nmemories playing on the beach, or growing up to the sound of crashing surf,\nwhile the morning breeze rustles the coconut-tree leaves.\n\n\nIts power of enchantment may have worked into young Impy as she grew\nup in Cavite, only to manifest itself in her various artistic phases, from\nher elegantly-designed serigraphs of the early 1980s to her painted metal\nsculptures in the mid-'80s, and her famed glass sheet-and-cullet pieces of\nthe late ' 80s to the early ' 90s. \n\n \n\nIts manifestation into stone is a calculated study of subdued\n tour de force  .\n\n\nThe once-energetic curvations have now settled into a\nwell-disciplined set of semi-circles, subsuming itself into the spirit of the\naged stone.\n\n\nThe use of marble first cropped up in her early-'90s glass pieces,\nand since then she has devoted herself to it.\n\n\nThat marble was the preferred choice, for stone seems to be\ncalculated on several mutually agreeable principles.\n\n\nOne is its extreme age, often running into tens of millions of years\nold.\n\n\nIts rarity and prized sheen also is another.\n\n\nFor this reason, the Greeks hauled white marble all across the Aegean\nand Mediterranean to decorate their temples and to carve their gods and\nheroes.\n\n\nTo the Asian aesthete, though, marble is more than just a status\nsymbol.\n\n\nIt personifies the very spirit of nature, its fossilized remnants\nserving as reminders of the ephemerality of existence; while its gnarled\nveins remind us of its status, in the eyes of Taoist philosophers, as the\nvery bones that hold the earth together. \n\n \n\nA sense of Filipino-ness in form, mingled with a sophisticated\nstudy in Asian aesthetics, prevails in Impy 's work.\n\n\nThe earlier starkness of her 1996 pieces has been modulated and\nenlivened, but its sense of contemplativeness is unarrested.\n\n\nWe see this most clearly in \" \" Diary, &rdquo;\n\" which from afar seems like a straightforward pylon, until you\nnotice the empty void inside it, lined in contrasting black-grey marble.\n\n\nThe almost complete elliptical chain is liberated, making the viewer\nexperience a cascade of contemplative associations that allow questions to\ncreep in. \n\n \n\nThis approach to meditation is less absolutist ( hence, \nZen  ) , and more dialogic ( hence,  Vedic  ) .\n\n\nThe Indian philosophical tradition must be taken into account more\nfully within our own historical and cultural context.\n\n\nAfter all, Sanskrit is the mother of many Filipino dialects, as well\nas ingraining many of our cultural attitudes.\n\n\nIt is this heterogenous but unified sense of Being that Impy Pilapil\nhas captured so well. \n\n \n\n\" \" Quest &rdquo; \" also takes a similarly\ncomplex view of introspection.\n\n\nFormed like a massive, undulating facade with open spaces like\nwindows, \" \" Quest &rdquo; \" creates a paradigm where\nthe seeker, instead of looking outside, searches within.\n\n\nThe surface helps.\n\n\nWith its accents of chipped surfaces contrasting with smoothly\npolished ones, this facade-as-sculpture captures a delicate - - indeed, even\ntense - - balance between surfaces and forms, horizontal slabs and vertical\nplanes, and between solid masses and empty voids. \n\n \n\nSuch an exploration is especially daring in \" \"\nEntry. &rdquo; \"\n\n\nThe architectonic alliterations are given full rein in this work,\nwhich resembles a classical doorway with curved flourishes for facade\nendings.\n\n\nOpenings are especially evocative in meditation.\n\n\nThe Japanese traditional   cha   house\nhas a small opening, called \" \" the humble doorway &rdquo;\n\" where one literally worms their way through the waist-high entry,\nsymbolizing the humility of every true contemplative.\n\n\nThe decision to walk through this one, with marble-slab lintel\nhanging solidly - - though again, propped up only by sheer dead weight - - is\na choice that is made only by believers.\n\n\nNeither oppressive nor imperious, \" \" Entry &rdquo;\n\" indicates the true nature of  Nirvana  by its\nall-inclusive, always-open door, but its purposeful entry allows one, in the\nwords of Impy,  \" to discover your soul.\"  \n\n \n\nThe two other pieces, \" \" Path &rdquo; \"\nand \" \" Solitude, &rdquo; \" hark back to the earlier\nPilapil of monolithic stones rising like massive pylons into the low ceiling.\n\n\nIts horizontal articulations have also responded to the generally\ncurvilinear main forms that Impy is endowing her other pieces.\n\n\nThis is also enlivened by her intermingling of black versus white\nmarble in a cross-sectional basis.\n\n\nThus, on one side of \" \" Solitude, &rdquo; \"\nfor example, one can see black slabs of marble, while on the other side, one\ncan only see white slabs.\n\n\nView it at an angle, or at its midpoint, and one sees both, meeting\nin mutually conjoined sections like mirror images culled from parallel\nuniverses.\n\n\nIts intersection, on the other hand, a seemingly knife-edged point,\nslowly undulates forward and backward, its main form wonderfully evocative of\nSamal male gravemarkers set on white beaches along the Sulu Archipelago.\n\n\nIts surface endowments of rough-versus-smooth texture also add to the\ndialogue of polar opposites, as united into a single, coherent work that\nspeaks volumes of silence. \n\n \n\nIn this age of nonstop urban stress, 16-hour workdays, and\ndysfunctional family relations, \" \" Find Your Truth &rdquo;\n\" acts as a therapeutic site, massaging our hassled nerves with the\nsimple joy of silence and contemplation.\n\n\nThat it also truly addresses its audiences as Filipinos is quite\nclear from the formal shapes and conceptual approaches.\n\n\nNoting that this production is underlain by a fundamental assumption\nof faith in materials, joined together but never glued nor reinforced (\nexcept for a little water), shows that belief, tempered by moderation, works\nmiracles where structural engineers would merely shake their heads. \n\n \n\nTruly, this searching of the Self, prompted by Impy 's own search\nfor transcendence and tranquility, results only in the elimination of the\nOutside, and the rediscovery of the Inside.\n\n\nLooking within herself, and speaking deeply and sincerely, Impy\nPilapil has found the milestones to her Fortress of Solitude.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ef50d2b0-7597-4e66-ad81-5cc9f7373ac0", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.228224+00:00"}
{"text": "The proper way to see a temple  \n\n\n Gilda Cordero Fernando \n\n \n\nI USED to be indifferent to these beautiful structures of Buddhism\nor Hinduism ( like Borobudur), because whenever I am in front of them, the\nguide reminds you,  \" I 'm giving you 45 minutes to look around\n- - please be back on the bus on time. &rdquo; \n\n\nAnd it would be high noon. \n\n \n\nBut it pays to mature.\n\n\nNow the six of us have come on our own in Indonesia, using Paleo\nSantoso 's van, and always the sun is near to setting.\n\n\nIf we wished, we could sit and meditate on every level of the\nPrambanan temple ( in Yogyakarta), lean our backs on the bell-shaped\n stupas  of Borobudur, drinking in all the carvings on the\nstone walls, dance with devotion around the Hindu gods of Suku temple ( in\nSolo), chug up to Ceto ( frightening a lot of cows), getting out of the\nvehicle and pushing because the temple is on a very high mountain. \n\n \n\nTemples are located in high places for obvious reasons: it is\neasier to commune with one 's god in undiluted air, surrounded by trees, and\nit 's nearer heaven.\n\n\nCeto temple is one of the last vestiges of the Madjapahit empire.\n\n\nIts king was daunted by the onslaught of Mohammedanism - - he was of\nthe Hindu religion, and a staunch one, and not even his son, a Muslim\nconvert, could persuade him.\n\n\nThe king fled to Suku, to Ceto, to the mountain of Lawu, 3,000 feet\nabove sea level, then disappeared. \n\n\n  Heroes  \n\n \n\nIndonesian tales are replete with heroes disappearing into thin\nair, and if you know your mythology ( or your \" \" Celestine\nProphecy &rdquo; \" ) , it is because the bodies of people with\nmystical consciousness become invisible to mortals of lower vibrations. \n\n \n\nAnd so, here we are in Ceto, among the ruins of a 16th-century\nHindu temple.\n\n\nBeing too high up, it is not a tourist destination.\n\n\nThere are at least 10 flights of steps to the top.\n\n\nFlat ground for resting in between, with an altar if you turn left\nand another if you go right. \n\n \n\nRoofed platforms have been built in front of each altar where one\ncan sit and contemplate the deity, breathing deeply of the mountain air.\n\n\nDown below sits an ancient stone turtle, guarding the secrets of\nhistory deep within its heart. \n\n \n\nThe symbols of the temple of Ceto are those of creation: the\n  lingam   , represented in all its erect, if by\nnow moldering, glory in one of the altars and the   yoni \n , represented by the narrow, split portal through which one passes\nto reach the open space at the top. \n\n \n\nI do not find the usual representations of Hindu gods like\nKrishna, Vishnu and Shiva that are familiar to me from my encyclopedia.\n\n\nInstead, at the last altar, I come face to face with a pudgy, almost\ncomical deity with a Stalinesque moustache!\n\n\nWe regard each other with grave misgivings.\n\n\nFor here we are, you and I, in the final analysis - - you are the god\nof my ancestors but you are a stranger to me.\n\n\nIn fact, in my ignorance, I find you grotesque and slightly\nridiculous.\n\n\nWhy are you not in silk raiments and jewels, and no gold halo quivers\nabove your head? \n\n\n  A similarity in myths  \n\n \n\nFrom our own prehistory, we learned that the first settlers in\nthe Philippines were Indonesians and Malays who had come fleeing from\noppressive tributes and other persecutions. \n\n \n\nThrough much contact during the Madjapahit empire, we share with\nthe Indonesians a similarity in myths and syllabic writing ( a kind of\nhieroglyphics, no less), all of which we have forgotten, adopting instead the\nalphabet and the fairy tales of other lands. \n\n \n\nWe are brothers in features and skin, but in nothing else.\n\n\nWe share a few root words but not our mind-set.\n\n\nWithout a  Bahasa  guidebook, one could perish\nwith hunger in a   leseha   ( native restaurant)\nand never get on in a   betya   (  pedicab\n ) . \n\n \n\nAnd so, to Indonesia we have been invited, to the garden of\nSuprapto Suyodarmo, our host, where a 10-day festival is taking place. \n\n \n\nThe male dancers have waist-long hair ( not one a gay), swinging\ntheir heads to and fro, their bodies slim and graceful, bending circularly in\nall directions, down to the floor and up, here in Solo, where the soft body\nhas not yet become the province of women.\n\n\nIt was some kind of ritual they were performing.\n\n\nThe women sang with a weird nasal twang ( almost like a caterwaul),\nlooking sideward and up to heaven, their long, pointed, steel-tipped\nfingernails twinkling in the moonlight. \n\n \n\nWe watch with rapt attention.\n\n\nBut what does it all mean?\n\n\nIt is obvious that these are a people who know who they are, who are\nproud of their roots, who dance ( no matter how weirdly to me) as they always\nhave. \n\n \n\nWas this how we would have been had we preserved our original\nAsian culture instead of learning how to cook   adobo \n</indig > ?\n\n\nIs it better or worse that they can speak no English and their\norchestra is composed of gongs, xylophones and reed flutes while my symphony\norchestra wears tuxedos and plays \" Prokofiev \" ? \n\n \n\nIn the festival I meet people of different races.\n\n\nMany are from Europe, traveling all that way from Germany, the\nNetherlands, Denmark, England, France, also the United States, Mexico,\nAustralia and all parts of Indonesia. \n\n\n  Dance  \n\n \n\nWe share a common language, that of movement.\n\n\nNot ballet, ballroom or folk dancing but a creative, almost\nritualistic dance that comes from deep within the self.\n\n\nNot dance as performance but as meditation, as examination of self to\nfind access to buried feelings and issues. \n\n \n\nThe fastest way to connect to the spirit is through the body.\n\n\nBut first, there must be a house cleaning.\n\n\nSuprapto Suyodarmo had introduced \" \" shared movement\n&rdquo; \" to us in Manila, and now we were meeting his many other\nstudents from all over the world. \n\n\n  Different bodies  \n\n \n\nHow interesting to observe how bodies bred in other countries\nmove so differently from ours!\n\n\nThe German woman 's gestures are cosmic.\n\n\nShe runs and leaps with great energy, strength that comes only from\nbig-framed, milk-and-cheese-nourished Caucasian bodies. \n\n \n\nThe Dutch and Danish males, one in black felt hat, the other in\n  sando   , are somber, moving silently, engrossed in\ntheir inner struggles.\n\n\nThey are very protective of their private space. \n\n \n\nOut of nowhere, a young Anglo-Saxon with funky blonde hair, whom\nI 'd never seen before, comes into the dancing space.\n\n\nHer movements are angular, twisted, as if dancing to big-city noise,\nher head rolling wildly ( I almost expect her tongue to roll out and her\neyeballs to recede). \n\n \n\nThe slim British bodies have finer movements, only recently\neducated to be freer.\n\n\nThe passionate gestures of the Mexican are stoked by an intense fire\nthat a body like mine, barbecued in years of Spanish domination, easily\nrelates to. \n\n \n\nAnd always the Japanese - - males and females - - are soft,\nsinuous, never to be hurried.\n\n\nLike the Filipinos, they are not afraid of body contact. \n\n \n\nSoon we are moving together, the earth and the minerals and the\nliquids in our bodies orchestrated by an inner music.\n\n\nExplains the German participant Jose van der Graaf:  \"\nRitual dance ( for indeed, it is one) expresses concretely, and in public, an\nalmost intangible experience. \n\n\nWe share our stimulated state of consciousness with others, perhaps\neven the whole community.\n\n\nThe feeling we experience is not really aesthetic - - not all of us\nare good dancers - - it is rather one of devotion.\n\n\nIn ritual dance the body is the place where the finite and the\ninfinite meet.  \"  \n\n \n\nMost Western participants are remaining here in Solo for a month\nor six months.\n\n\nSome have been living here for a year.\n\n\nThey are grim and determined in their search, making us Filipinos\nfeel almost frivolous.\n\n\nBut why devote our lives to something we 've never lost?\n\n\nWe are, after all, a product of the East and the West. \n\n \n\nIt is to young searchers, who are unbathed and uncombed, their\nlong, pale legs scratched and dotted with flea bites, that my heart goes out.\n\n\nWhose once lovely son or daughter is this who has traveled so\nexceedingly far and lives out of a seedy backpack? \n\n\n  Great exchange  \n\n \n\nSome are seething with anger at mothers who, they claim, do not\nlove them, escaping from what they perceive to be spiritually bankrupt\nenvironments.\n\n\nThey have decreed that here, and only here in this power spot ( Solo,\nBali, Kathmandu or somewhere in the heart of India) can they ever find their\nway home.\n\n\n( And suppose Solo cannot heal you?\n\n\nWhere do you go from here, torn flower child?)\n\n\nThe West coming to the East for the answer!\n\n\nFor once I am not envious of the First World 's museums, buildings,\ncommerce and health. \n\n \n\nThen I am reminded that today is a Monday.\n\n\nFor four years now, on Monday evenings in Manila, our group comes\ntogether to study, deeply and adoringly not a  lama  , but\na 19th century German philosopher named Rudolf Steiner.\n\n\nAn egghead. \n\n \n\nFor years we struggled through Steiner 's rich and difficult\nwritings: it was he who set us on our little traveled path.\n\n\n( When we felt we were getting too mental, too top heavy, \"\nsharing dance &rdquo; restored the balance.)\n\n\nStrange, orientals seeking in the cold tomes of the West their\nkindest, truest guidance?\n\n\nA great exchange, if you ask me.  \n\n\n\n\n  Three centennial works: Enigmatic, rousing, original\n \n\n\n Rosalinda L. Orosa \n\n \n\nToo many \" happenings &rdquo; made it virtually impossible\nfor me to attend every single one of them.\n\n\nAt the two-night \" \"  Alay sa Sandaang Taon\n \" \" at the CCP, I missed hearing the works of Ramon\nSantos and Chino Toledo, both of whom had been expressly commissioned to\ncompose for the centennial.\n\n\nIn the past, I did have occasion to listen and appreciate Mr. Santos 's\ncompositions. \n\n \n\nThe second night of \" \"  Alay \n\" \" featured three pieces.\n\n\nThese were, in chronological order, \" \" Centennial\nTribute to Filipino Womanhood &rdquo; \" by National Artist Lucrecia\nR. Kasilag, \" \"  Alamat ng Lahi  \"\n\" by National Artist Lucio San Pedro, and \" \" Rituals\n&rdquo; \" by Jeffrey Ching. \n\n \n\nConcept of Miss Kasilag 's work, described as  \" a\nsymphonic cycle in four parts for orchestra, indigenous instruments and mixed\nmedia\"  was by Ma. Paz Lagdameo.\n\n\nOthers involved in its execution were Deniza Reyes, choreographer;\nIrma Adlawan Marasigan, Eve ( Adam was not identified); Dennis R. Marasigan,\nlighting designer; Nonon Padilla, director. \n\n \n\nMrs. Lagdameo 's concept, as explained in the beautifully written\nprogram notes, is on a high, grandiose, idealistic plane, doubtless in\nkeeping with the serious Centennial theme.\n\n\nIn interpretation, however, the joint effort of composer and\nchoreographer did not seem to reflect it.\n\n\nMiss Kasilag had asserted to a member of the audience that her\ntribute to Filipino womanhood was meant to depict  \" light\nhumor.\" \n\n\nWhen viewed within this context, the work could indeed pass as a\nclever satire, farce or caricature. \n\n \n\nRecall, for instance, the ballerina in leotards and tights\nexecuting  fouettes    en pointes \n to the very discernible tune of \" \"  Ako ay\nFilipino  \" \" ; or the baretorso-ed Adam appearing\nwith his Eve garbed in Maria Clara costume - - a wonderful parody of the\nanachronistic, clinging-vine, overly modest \" Maria Clara \"\nin this permissive day and age. \n\n \n\nThen, too, there were the five or more \" Maria Claras\n\" crawling under the skirt of Eve.\n\n\nThe collective images would have portrayed in an ingenious,\ntongue-in-cheek manner, the birth of sextuplets, thus proving the effectivity\nof fertility pills. \n\n \n\nAnd as a  coup de grace  , let us hark back\nto the dead Adam being resuscitated by an air pump as though he were an\nautomobile tire. \n\n \n\nAll these figures flitting hither and thither onstage certainly\nconveyed  \" light humor\". \n\n\nHowever, with the program notes serving as imperative guide, the\nspectator inevitably made an attempt to equate or relate concept, music, and\nchoreography with each other - - to no avail.\n\n\nAccordingly, concept - -  albeit  beautifully\nenvisioned - - music and choreography remained as three disparate, distinct\nelements, with the over-all result appearing enigmatic. \n\n \n\nThe choreography, on its own, would have been readily\nappreciated had it been viewed as a satire which obviously it was not meant\nto be owing to the initial concept.\n\n\nThe music, likewise, would have been easily appreciated as an\nindependent creation - - a relatively conventional piece as lyrical as Miss\nKasilag could make it, she being partial to atonality.\n\n\nAs a concession to the centennial, the composition showed\ndiscernible folk and contemporary Philippine songs which could have been more\ntightly and subtly integrated and interwoven into the work.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f73db87d-ba64-4951-87d9-7bcba39c2487", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.229819+00:00"}

Quezon III \n\n \n\nWE have certainly had an eventful - - and messy - - past hundred\nyears.\n\n\nSince 1898 we have lived under the flags of three conquerors - -\nSpain, the United States and Japan - - before obtaining independence for good\nunder our own banner in 1946.\n\n\nIn a century we have gone through three Spanish governors-general, 14\nAmerican military governors and civilian governors-general, three American\nHigh Commissioners, a revolutionary  supremo  , 12\nFilipino presidents ( with one more just beginning his term), one of whom was\na dictator.\n\n\nWe have lived under various Organic Acts and five constitutions, have\nhad four republics ( not counting Marcos 's bogus martial law \"\n\" New Republic &rdquo; \" ) and a commonwealth, had seven\ndifferent legislatures that variously tried unicameralism, bicameralism, and\nauthoritarianism, fought wars with three great powers, been afflicted by two\nmajor insurgencies, hatched and staged innumerable rebellions, successfully\nheld a peaceful people-power revolution, and endured eight coup attempts.\n\n\n \n\n  Defeat   .\n\n\nWe went from a successful revolution against Spain to an abject defeat\nat the hands of the Americans, were defeated once more by the Japanese, only\nfor our independence to be recognized with so many strings attached that we\nhave spent the past 52 years trying to give substance to that independence.\n\n\n \n\nAnd yet we 're still here, as a nation and a people, to celebrate\nthe proclamation of our independence on June 12, 1898, an independence\ngenuinely but far too briefly enjoyed by ourselves. \n\n \n\nWe must have done, been doing, and continue to do, something\nright for us to be where we are, right now.\n\n\nOr have we? \n\n \n\nIt depends on whom you ask, I suppose. \n\n \n\nThe story of our nation - - and the accompanying saga of our\nnationhood - - has often been portrayed as a chronicle of missed\nopportunities, betrayed aspirations, and incredible incompetence and venality\non the part of our leaders.\n\n\nOur past has been presented to us as a series of dashed hopes, of a\npeople yearning to be free of foreign domination, only to suffer the\nindignity of local tyranny. \n\n \n\nIt is not just our leaders who have been shown as having failed\nus time and again; writers glory in revealing how we have failed ourselves,\nover and over again, making Filipinos past and present accomplices to the\ndegradation of our nation.\n\n\nWe have been a people too flexible, too patient, too cheerful, and\nfar too generous to be worthy of surviving the rigors of nation-building; and\nyet at the same time we are too jealous, too undisciplined, too eager to\nmuddle through, and far too easy to charm, to be capable of building a\ngenuine nation-state.\n\n\nWe are, our very own intellectuals - - and those who ape them - -\ntell us, too effete to be capable of assuming the responsibilities of\ncitizenship.\n\n\nIt is not just our state, to use the terminology of Jose Almonte,\nthat is \" \" soft, &rdquo; \" but the Filipino people as\nwell. \n\n \n\nIn stark contrast to our national self-proclaimed propensity for\nanarchy and dishonesty is the sight of our neighbors, lands of consensus and\nguided development, nations composed of industrious drones toiling under the\ndirection of enlightened despots; countries populated by people with\n per capita  incomes that dwarf ours several times over;\nreal nations with a genuine sense of nationhood, imbued with the sort of\nnationalism that should shame us. \n\n \n\n  Many firsts.  \n\n\nAnd yet we are told - - perhaps to rub the sense of inferiority in\ndeeper - - that we have achieved so many firsts: we were the first to mount a\nrevolution against a colonial overlord; the first to defeat an occupying\npower ( and be defeated by another one); the first to achieve political\nautonomy and indeed, independence in the post-war era.\n\n\nWe were the first democracy, although not the first to be shackled by\na dictatorship, but we were the first to rise up as a people in order to\nsuccessfully kick a tyrant out of the presidential palace. \n\n \n\nSo which is it?\n\n\nAre we a people and a country that has been betrayed time and again,\nby foreigners and ourselves, a nation whose history is nothing less - - and\nnothing more - - than a catalogue of missed opportunities and failed\nattempts?\n\n\nShould we be subscribing to some grand conspiracy theory that\naccounts for our state of backwardness and political retardation?\n\n\nOr aren't we really rather well off considering what we 've been\nthrough? \n\n \n\nI prefer to think that the latter is truer than the former. \n\n \n\nWe owe our being a free nation today to the very things that\nothers say keep us from being advanced states made in their image.\n\n\nWe owe the success - - the survival - - of the Philippines to our\nlack of unity, to our propensity for bickering, to our crab mentality, to our\npenchant for anarchy.\n\n\nWe are an independent-minded and free-spirited people.\n\n\nSo free-spirited that even as we were in awe of Rizal, we managed to\ncall him names behind his back; so independent-minded that we refused to have\none single  Supremo  , and later, an absolutist president\nfor our First Republic.\n\n\nWe launched a  bourgeois  revolution and yet\nforced the same  bourgeoisie  , when it succumbed to the\nhoneyed words of the Americans, to rededicate itself to independence or face\nostracism at the polls.\n\n\nSo free-spirited were we, in fact, that we found time to engage in\npolitical intramurals even as we sought independence on the Americans '\nterms; so free-spirited were we, that we thought nothing of paralyzing the\ninsular government as Pro split from Anti; and even as the \nNacionalistas  built a political machine never since equaled in our\nhistory, we saw it fit to elect independent-minded people, free-spirited\nleaders to make life difficult for the Commonwealth regime. \n\n \n\nWe were independent-minded enough to see that World War II was\nabout fighting fascism and defending an independence that was sure to come,\nas it did come, ahead of any other colonized nation in the world; we never\nhesitated to go against the flow, to buck the tide, to be for democracy when\nour neighbors found it unfashionable. \n\n \n\nThe  charisma  and rhetoric of our leaders\ncould only get them so far.\n\n\nTime after time we said to them, enough is enough - - and voted them\nout of office before their delusions of grandeur got the better of them.\n\n\nWe thought nothing of humbling statesmen and elevating matinee idols,\njust to prove who was boss; and even if guns, goons and gold managed to make\nus forget to cherish our liberties, and yes, though eventually we made fools\nof ourselves by finally falling to the rhetoric of our own homegrown\ndictator, we came to our senses sooner than most and sent the man packing,\njust as we sent many of his predecessors packing, too ( albeit a little more\ngracefully). \n\n \n\nWe are easy to impress, but it is difficult to sustain our\ninterest.\n\n\nWe are all wise guys, know-it-alls, and there always comes a time\nwhen the old tunes begin to bore us, and the old antics cease to entertain\nus, and we opt for something new. \n\n \n\n  Administrations.  \n\n\nThat has been the salvation of our nation.\n\n\nWe threw out the party of de Tavera; we elevated the \nPartido Nacionalista  , but gleefully divided it into the Liberal\nand the  Nacionalista  parties, which kept reinventing\nthemselves to suit the popular mood.\n\n\nWhen we had had enough of our  rigodon  - dancing\nand Spanish-speaking politicians, we voted them out of office, too, replacing\nthen with the administration of a mechanic.\n\n\n\" \"  La Cumparsita  , &rdquo;\n\" \" \" Mambo Magsaysay, &rdquo; \" the\n\" \" March of the New Society, &rdquo; \" \"\n\"  Bayan Ko  , &rdquo; \" every generation found\na new song to make its own; \" My Guy \" gave way to \"\nFilipino First \" , which was replaced with \" the New Era\n\" , itself overturned by \" the New Society \" ,\nwhich was demolished by \" People Power \" ; and when the\nallure of yellow faded, we tried the Old Boy network of \" Philippines\n2000 \" and found it compared poorly to \" That 's\nEntertainment \" .\n\n\nAnd so we have administrations  a la mode  .\n\n\nWe are just plain fickle: the healthiest democratic mood there is.\n\n\n \n\n\" The EDSA experience \" is instructive: the\nnation once referred to as composed of one son of a bitch ( Marcos) and 40\nmillion cowards ( the rest of us) finally got the courage to reject the\ndictator and all his works, thereby gaining the admiration of the world.\n\n\nWe gave the world the term \" \" people power, &rdquo;\n\" which has been appended to accounts of the fall of tyrants from\nBerlin to Budapest and Seoul to Jakarta.\n\n\nWe clung to ballot boxes with a devotion unheard of in countries with\nlong histories of democracy; we knelt before tanks; all the while arguing\namong ourselves, distrusting our neighbors, happily ignoring the law and\nrules of common decency, deluding ourselves into giving our jailer, the\ndictator, the benefit of the doubt until Ninoy Aquino was shot and we\nsuddenly discovered that enough was enough. \n\n \n\nThen we moved; and when we began to march, run, jog, fight, and\nshout for our freedom, nothing could stop us. \n\n \n\nThe reason for our ability to endure and prevail are these: we\nare perpetually busy gossiping, backbiting, scheming and whining.\n\n\nIn other words, we have always had independence of heart.\n\n\nThese may be funny ways to show it, but better a free people with\nfreewheeling ways, than a people numbed by tyranny.\n\n\nAnd when we aren't busy grumbling, when we aren't somersaulting from\nmanic rage to self-pitying pessimism, we have always dared to laugh, at each\nother and ourselves; and when we aren't busy laughing at ourselves, we are\nchuckling over the antics of those who lead us. \n\n \n\n  Different   .\n\n\nWe are having the last laugh; the joke is on those who said we had\nbeen left behind by history.\n\n\nThey told us that we were the odd man out in our part of the world,\nwhich is true, but not in the way they meant it.\n\n\nWe are different because we have achieved something it will take\ngenerations for our neighbors to enjoy: the ability to look at ourselves, and\nsmile.\n\n\nRizal taught us to laugh at the Spaniards until, in a fit of\n pique  , they had him shot.\n\n\nRizal and his fellow Propagandists devised and bequeathed to us the\ncruelest weapon ever devised against absolute power, humor, with devastating\neffectiveness.\n\n\nWe even dared to use it against the self-appointed \npraetorian  guards of the Armed Forces when they tried to take our\nfreedom away from us. \n\n \n\nLaughing at  putschists  may have gotten some\nof us shot, too, just as it got some students of an earlier generation\nincarcerated and tortured under Marcos for snickering  \"  sa\nikauunlad ng bayan, bisikleta and kailangan  \"  ; just as\nit got the generation of their parents slapped and even killed under the\nJapanese for saying \" \"   kabayo  \n\" \" instead of \" \"   konichi-wa\n  \" \" while bowing before the \nKempeitai  ; just as it got Marcelo H. del Pilar and Graciano Lopez\nJaena exiled for satirizing the friars and got Rizal shot for writing\nsatirical novels about Philippine colonial society as a whole.\n\n\nBut whenever we have been faced with overwhelming strength, we have\nhad the courage to laugh. \n\n \n\nThe blood of martyrs and innocents, and tears of sorrow and rage\nhave flowed often enough, that is true.\n\n\nBut so have tears of joy, which coursed down the cheeks of Filipinos\non June 12, 1898, on July 4, 1946, on February 25, 1986, and November 24,\n1992.\n\n\nAnd it is the afterglow of those events that have given meaning to\nour lives, and made the pain bearable when times have been tough, and our\nresolve firm when we decided that enough was enough.\n\n\nCall it muddling through, but our march to nationhood has never\nhalted.\n\n\nWhatever fate has had in store for us, we have learned to just grin\nand bear it.\n\n\nAnd when we can't bear it any longer, we go out and vote.\n\n\nAnd woe to those who try to keep us from doing that. \n\n \n\n  Tragedy.  \n\n\nThe tragedy of our history is that the tale of our nation has been\nwritten by people without a sense of humor.\n\n\nThat is a delicious irony in itself: the story of our collective\nlives have been written by those missing the most elementary of Filipino\nvirtues.\n\n\nRizal, poor sod, took himself far too seriously, and what is worse,\nthe Spaniards took him far too seriously as well.\n\n\nAnd so, we revolted against the Spanish spoilsports.\n\n\nThen the Americans came and made chumps of us, which provoked the\nall-Filipino reaction of our bitterly resenting having been had; though our\nattempts to wage a war on Western terms came to a suitably ludicrous end:\nwith Frederick Funston sitting on Emilio Aguinaldo, pinning him down as\nMacabebe scouts and Funston 's friends ran pell-mell, arresting Aguinaldo 's\nstaff. \n\n \n\nOne of our handicaps is that though we love a good joke, we can't\nstand jokes at our expense; and we are naturally disposed to be toadies,\nthough when people point that out we rebel and proclaim ourselves radicals.\n\n\nTrinidad H. Pardo de Tavera and Benito Legarda and friends, flattered\nby American attention, got entranced with the idea - - planted in their heads\nby William Howard Taft - - that we were little brown Americans: an idea the\nAmericans found rather cute but impractical, but which the  Partido\nFederalista  found was a little to extreme for the voters ' taste.\n\n\nAnd so they got a licking.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "916091c3-d200-4b77-b5ad-9100fe0f629b", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.231098+00:00"}

\n\n \n\n \" Japan 's the ball game right now,\" \ncomments Xie. \n\n\n \" The possibility of outright recession there and\nchaos in Indonesia is the script for this whole thing spinning out of\ncontrol. &rdquo;   \n\n\n Japan 's Big Bang \n\n \n\nBecause of the devaluations around Asia, these countries must go\nfull blast with exports.\n\n\nSo they need markets besides the US and Europe.\n\n\nJapan can supply this critical need as she is the second-largest\neconomy in the world. \n\n \n\nJapan is Asia 's prime saver, for the nation has accumulated a\nhuge hoard of foreign exchange overtime: &dollar;12 trillion in savings.\n\n\nIt supplies half the net savings needed by borrowers round the world.\n\n\n \n\nJapan can use its savings to buy goods from the rest of Asia and\nthus prime the pump of growth.\n\n\nHowever, the Bank of Tokyo reports that Japan 's economy is stagnant.\n\n\nThe 1990s have been called the one percent decade because of the low\ngrowth rate. \n\n \n\n \" We are very rich, but we don't know how to use\nour money, &rdquo;  notes Kiichi Miyazawa, former Japanese Prime\nMinister. \n\n \n\nThe Japanese brand of capitalism is noted for social harmony, and\nprotecting the main instruments of that harmony, the banks. \n\n \n\nIt 's like this.\n\n\nIn the ' 70s and ' 80s Japan dumped its cheap exports abroad while\nlimiting its imports.\n\n\nThat built up huge reservoirs of capital.\n\n\nMuch of the money went abroad in the form of notoriously cheap\ncredit. \n\n \n\nThus arose the building spree across Southeast Asia.\n\n\nLenders lent recklessly and borrowers borrowed recklessly.\n\n\nOvercapacity resulted, triggering the business failure in Thailand.\n\n\n \n\nBack in Japan, cheap credit allowed companies to maintain\nunproductive workers.\n\n\nThat 's why the unemployment rate is a rather low 3.5 percent.\n\n\nBecause they serve as social stabilizers, banks are allowed to keep\naccumulating much capital.\n\n\nSo while they hold tremendous assets, they show the lowest return on\nequity in the world. \n\n \n\nThe fattened banks are as big as  Sumo \nwrestlers.\n\n\nSumitomo Bank 's assets alone equal South Korea 's gross domestic\nproduct.\n\n\nThe fear is that one of those giants may collapse, hence the Ministry\nof Finance rushes to rescue the ailing ones.\n\n\nBut that coddling leads to imprudent investment. \n\n \n\nJapan needs to turn its financial system, bolster domestic\ndemand, and open its markets more. \n\n \n\nIMF officials have said quietly that Japan 's refusal to change\nmay post the most serious threat to the world economy. \n\n \n\nThe government plans to liberalize the financial sector by April,\na move nicknamed \" the Big Bang \" .\n\n\nIt will open up Japan 's securities, brokerages and asset markets.\n\n\nThe biggest Japanese international banks will have to comply with\ninternational standards. \n\n \n\n\" Newsweek \" speaks of fears that the \n\" equity market will plunge by the end of the fiscal year in March.\n\" \n\n\nBanks will rush to avoid unrealized stock losses. \n\n\n Trigger Indonesia \n\n \n\nAnother crucial actor is Indonesia, whose turbulent currency has\nrocked markets all over the world.\n\n\nWhenever its market drops, so does the rest of Asia. \n\n \n\nStability is important for Indonesia, a powderkeg of 190 million\npeople.\n\n\nThis will require obedience to the rigid reform package imposed by\nthe International Monetary Fund. \n\n \n\nTowing the IMF line will be difficult.\n\n\nPresident Suharto signed an agreement with the IMF in January but\ndeclared that he will run for a seventh 5-year term.\n\n\nOne wonders if that will prolong the corruption that mars the First\nFamily which controls major chunks of the economy. \n\n \n\nThen there 's the concern that President Suharto is ailing.\n\n\nSuharto hinted that B. J. Habibie will be his successor.\n\n\nHabibie is not well regarded by the Western financial community, so\nthe announcement rocked markets across the globe. \n\n \n\nAdding to Indonesia 's woes is the drought caused by \"\n El Ni&ntilde;o  \" .\n\n\nThat can foment social unrest. \n\n \n\nIndonesia 's crisis is very deep.\n\n\nEarlier on she had suffered a devaluation equal to our peso falling\nto 100 per dollar.\n\n\nJakarta estimates that some one million Indonesians will be thrown\nout of work in 1998. \n\n \n\nCertain foreign banks have given up on the hope of being repaid\nin dollars.\n\n\nThey are accepting payment in  rupiah  rather than\nin dollars. \n\n \n\nNoting that the  rupiah  has depreciated 80\npercent in its value, Moody 's Investors Services, a rating agency, stated\nthat firms are finding it hard to service their foreign currency debt.\n\n\nJakarta said that around 220 local companies were in danger of\ndefaulting. \n\n \n\nA senior IMF official reported that some corporations were\nalready defaulting.  \n\n\n\n\n  Lessons learned from the peso turmoil  \n\n\n Virgilio S.

Trillana III \n\n \n\n TODAY  we celebrate the centennial of the First\nPhilippine Republic.\n\n\nIn all of colonized Asia, it was the Filipinos who first gave flesh\nto the ideal of freedom by declaring independence in Kawit on June 12, 1898\nand establishing a constitutional republic in Malolos seven months later.\n\n\nThe Filipinos were thus the forerunners of the freedom movement in\nAsia.\n\n\nAs such, the Kawit proclamation and the Malolos Republic--pivotal\nlinks in the progressive chain of events that brought us to where we are\ntoday--could well be the focal point of the Centennial celebrations. \n\n \n\nStill there is a compelling reason to be concerned.\n\n\nIt is not only that controversy still surrounds the arrest and death\nof Andres Bonifacio, the Father of the Revolution, upon orders or with the\nconsent of Emilio Aguinaldo, the Father of the Republic.\n\n\nIt has much to do also with the seeming perception that their\ntragically interconnected lives directed the passage of the country for the\nsucceeding 100 years into opposite and contrary horizons. \n\n \n\nThe worrisome thing about Kawit and Malolos is that they may\nkeep us focused on the trappings of statehood just as they did 100 years ago,\nwithout allowing us to sort out the moral underpinnings of nationhood.\n\n\nThey may keep us off-balance and divert our national consciousness\nfrom the full import of the Rizal-Bonifacio-Mabini vision for a moral nation.\n\n\nThey may devour us just as Tejeros and  Biak-na-Bato \nsucked us into a vortex of   rigodon   politics,\nwhich we now fondly call \"  \"  Kalayaan \n&rdquo;  . \" \n\n \n\nThere is a world of difference between statehood (  \nbansa   ) and nationhood (   bayan   ) .\n\n\nStatehood establishes the institutional infrastructure of command;\nnationhood generates the organizing spirit of rule.\n\n\nStatehood builds the bureaucracy, foreign relations, roads, schools,\ncommunications, the emblems of government; nationhood develops the bond, the\ngrit, the verve, the temper, the energy, the soul of governance.\n\n\nStatehood is a modality of power; nationhood is the morality of\npower. \n\n \n\nJose Rizal hinted at a further distinction when he said: \n\" I have always loved my country and wished for her moral and material\ndevelopment. &rdquo; \n\n\nStatehood develops the materials of society; nationhood nurtures the\nmorals of the community.\n\n\nStatehood emphasizes the external; nationhood, the internal. \n\n \n\nTo confuse statehood and nationhood then is to miss completely\nthe point of what Rizal and Bonifacio died for.\n\n\nRizal fought not only to give birth to a state but to a moral nation\nand died at the hands of those who would maintain a foreign state 's royal\ncontrol over a nascent nation.\n\n\nBonifacio fought not only to drive the Spaniards home but to build a\nnation of \"   mga kapatid   \" steeped in\nthe practice of brotherly love.\n\n\nHe died at the hands of those who would establish an indigenous\nsovereign state to control a newborn nation in order to maintain political\nand economic power. \n\n \n\nIt was a tragic case of state versus nation.\n\n\nTo miss this point is to condemn ourselves to make the same mistakes\nof history over and over again.\n\n\nThe greater mistake, however, is to fail to see that the\nrequirements of state and nation are not contradictory.\n\n\nThey are interdependent and complementary.\n\n\nTaking stock of the last 100 years of our history should be an\nexercise in refocusing our directions and efforts not only on the external\nand the material but also on the internal and the moral.\n\n\nBoth are important in the equation of the nation-state. \n\n \n\nIt is necessary to cultivate what Rizal, Bonifacio and Mabini\nprescribed for the nurturing of our nationhood: a strong and solid moral\nfoundation.\n\n\nAnchored on Rizal 's overarching idea of education, reinforced by\nBonifacio 's insistence on \"   mahal at magandang ugali ng\nating bayan   \" and distinguished by Mabini 's dream of a\ncountry marked with \" virtue, &rdquo; the complete revolution had to be\na harmonious reconciliation between the forces of state, which Aguinaldo\ncommanded, and the moral interests of the nation, which Rizal, Bonifacio, and\nMabini demanded.\n\n\nTo borrow Adib Majul 's description of Mabini 's revolutionary\nideology,  \" the revolution was to be both a technique for the\nattainment of independence and a process for the moral development of a\npeople. &rdquo; \n\n\nIn this sense, Rizal, Bonifacio, Mabini and Aguinaldo are not\nantithetical ideologists.\n\n\nThey are complementary heroes. \n\n \n\nHow do we cultivate the moral fiber of the people to achieve\nthis dynamic balance between the concerns of statehood and nationhood?\n\n\nAmong other things, by projecting in the clearest light possible the\ncompelling  persona  of   Inang Bayan \n , engaging the attention of a critical mass of people to focus on\nher message that we are, at the very heart of all state concerns for\npolitical, economic and military governance, also   Mga Anak ng\nBayan   , whose equally foremost duty is to unite in a national\nsolidarity of honor and dignity--   ang Katipunang Kagalang-galang\nat Kataastaasan   . \n\n \n\nOne hundred years ago, the medium of engaging the attention of a\ncritical mass of people through satire and   comedia \n entertainment was the   nobela   and\nthe   zarzuela   .\n\n\nToday, the medium of grabbing such mass attention and of reorienting\nour people 's values and attitudes--by satirizing the colonizer 's language\nand usages--seems to be the   pelikula   .\n\n\nErap has  Famas  - ly harnessed it, rubbing the same on\nelitist  ilustrado  noses to trim them down to the proper\n  pagka-pango--masyado na kasing tumangos ang mga ilong ng ating\nmga kababayan sa ka-iingles at natakpan na ng katangusang ito ang kanilang\npananaw sa lupang tinubuan at tinatayuan   . \n\n \n\nLooking back at the harried pageantry of statehood on June 12,\n1898 and Jan. 23, 1899, and seeing how they deflected us from the full\nfounding vision of   Inang Bayan   ( coming as they\ndid on the heels of the Maragondon executions), can we now set our sights not\nonly on sovereignty but also on sobriety and gaze with humility on what lies\nahead of us as a people?\n\n\nCan we now, under the direction of one honed in the art and\ntechnique of transforming masses of movie spectators into motivated actors of\npolitical change, train our spotlights on   Inang Bayan \n in the theater of   Kasaysayan   so that the\nobsession with power and statehood now segues definitively into the\nRizal-Bonifacio-Mabini vision of a model   sambayanan \n , braiding together the demands of the state and the nation and\nhealing our land at last? \n\n \n\nIt is high time we sang and lived the  Katipunan \nnational anthem--    \" Mabuhay, mabuhay ang\nkalayaan/Pasulungin ang puri't kabanalan! &rdquo;

{"text": "What is a  'trapo'  ?  \n\n\n Randy David \n\n \n\n \" IT is a piece of cloth used for cleaning, &rdquo;\n Speaker Jose de Venecia told a talk show audience recently as he\ntried vainly to recover the positive meaning of a word that has stubbornly\nclung to him.\n\n\nIn this unique vocabulary of Philippine politics, it is not, of\ncourse, the   trapo   's cleaning power, but its\nnatural affinity with dirt, that is recalled when applied to politicians.\n\n\n \n\nThe term, as we know it, is a clever contraction of \"\n\" traditional politician. &rdquo; \"\n\n\nHow this term came to acquire the negative values it signifies in our\npolitical terminology remains a mystery to me.\n\n\nFor the adjective \" \" traditional &rdquo; \" in\nthe Philippine context is typically employed in a positive light, as in\n\" \" traditional values. &rdquo; \"\n\n\nAnd the word \" \" politician, &rdquo; \" while\nloaded with more negative than positive connotations, can actually be made to\nlook good when paired with an affirmative word, like \" \"\nprogressive &rdquo; \" or \" \" new. &rdquo; \"\n\n\n \n\nIn political theory, the term \" \" traditional\nleadership &rdquo; \" is a purely analytical category.\n\n\nThe German sociologist Max Weber gave us three types of leadership:\ncharismatic, traditional, and legal-rational or bureaucratic.\n\n\nHe had good as well as bad things to say about them all. \n\n \n\nThe charismatic leader inspires faith and determination among his\nfollowers, but in the long run, unable to organize and delegate authority, he\nis unable to hold his constituency.\n\n\nThe traditional leader, on the other hand, inherits authority, and\nrepresents a link in a hallowed chain, but, like many monarchs, his own\npersonal qualities may not suit him for the position into which he has been\nthrust.\n\n\nThe bureaucratic leader, to Weber, is the model of the modern leader.\n\n\nChosen on the basis of his own merits and capabilities, he represents\na necessary link in a rational chain of command, but then, like the typical\nbureaucrat, he may often lack the personal magic that alone can galvanize and\npush a community forward. \n\n \n\nThus, Weber foresaw that political orders would tend to swing\nfrom charisma to tradition to bureaucracy, and then back again to charisma.\n\n\nHis own view of progress favored the increasing rationalization of\nevery sphere of human activity, but he was also painfully aware that the\nforces of renewal and vitality often come from territories outside reason.\n\n\n \n\nThere is nothing here that provides any basis for the\ncomprehensive denigration of the traditional politician that we find today in\nPhilippine politics.\n\n\nThe traditional politician in political theory may be part of a\ndynasty and may often be proven to be unfit to rule, but he personifies\nstability and continuity.\n\n\nIn our own society in an earlier time, they would have been referred\nto as \" gentlemen of the old school \" , for whom politics\nwas a calling or a vocation. \n\n \n\nBut today 's   trapo   summons none of\nthis nostalgia.\n\n\nHe finds himself in the same league as the \" \" crony\ncapitalist, &rdquo; \" a metaphor that was born in the Marcos years\nto refer to a businessman who amasses wealth by the scandalous use of\npolitical influence.\n\n\nThe \"   trapo   \" in our\nlexicon refers to a politician who uses wealth to buy power, exploits the\npoverty of his constituents through selective patronage, and treats public\nfunds and facilities as if they were his own personal resources.\n\n\nIn his speeches, he casually makes extravagant promises, and recites\na litany of projects and accomplishments as if they were the heroic deeds of\na lone superman. \n\n \n\nThe   trapo   has no unflinching\ncommitment to any set of ideals.\n\n\nHis only commitment is to himself.\n\n\nHis most highly valued skill is the ability to work out compromises\nthat offer something to everyone.\n\n\nAs far as he is concerned, everyone has a price. \n\n \n\nBecause he has no core self, except that which defines his thirst\nfor power, he has no problem assuming contradictory identities.\n\n\nAnd though he may sometimes justify this as ecumenism, it is really\nnothing but opportunism.\n\n\nThe   trapo   will clothe himself in the\ncolors of the flag if that will make him seem like a patriot.\n\n\nHe will hang scapulars around his neck if that will project him like\na pious man. \n\n \n\nHe will have his picture taken with his wife and children if that\nwill show that he is an ideal family man.\n\n\nBut, in the end, we don't know who he is, what he believes in, and\nwhat higher things he lives for. \n\n \n\nThe revulsion against the   trapo   in\nour society represents this generation 's deep yearning for a renewing.\n\n\nIt comes from the same modernist impulse that unified the business\ncommunity at one time to launch a crusade against crony capitalism. \n\n \n\nAfter the overthrow of Marcos in 1986, almost everyone thought\nthe era of modern politics was at last upon us.\n\n\nThe old parties and political families had lain dormant for over two\ndecades.\n\n\nAnd indeed, many new faces filled the political stage.\n\n\nWhat we did not expect was the tenacity of the old political culture.\n\n\nThe new forces were not accustomed to the electoral arena.\n\n\nThey groped for models of how to reimagine democratic politics after\na dictatorship without going back to the familiar ways of patronage and\nclientism. \n\n \n\nAt the end of the Ramos presidency, we now know that Philippine\npolitics has come full circle.\n\n\nTraditional politics is fully restored.\n\n\nAnd those who had thought of themselves as its gravediggers remain as\nmarginal as ever.\n\n\nThe 1998 election is a watershed in our political life, for unless\nthe forces of modern politics come together to stop the   trapo\n  's final ascent to power, our nation may enter the new\nmillennium hopelessly weighed down by obsolete leaders.  \n\n\n\n\n  Looking back at Edsa  \n\n\n Randy David \n\n \n\n LIKE  many of the ordinary folk who attended its\nbirth 12 years ago, I have trouble summoning enough spirit to celebrate\nanother Edsa anniversary.\n\n\n\" Edsa \" was about a people mustering their\ncollective will and courage to bring down a dictatorship by a direct\nmanifestation of their power.\n\n\nThat power drew its force from nothing more than the certainty of its\nmoral message.\n\n\nIt was otherwise basically unarmed. \n\n \n\nThe message it embodied was simple: There is a limit to the abuse\nof power.\n\n\nFor grossly enriching themselves at the expense of the nation, and\nfor causing untold oppression and suffering to the Filipino people, the\nMarcoses and their cronies deserved to be the target of the people 's outrage\nand must be booted out of office.\n\n\nGovernment must serve the people, and not the other way around. \n\n \n\n\" Edsa \" was a great moment in our nation 's\nhistory.\n\n\nIts significance is comparable to that of the 1896 Revolution.\n\n\nBut, for all the heroism it symbolizes, whenever we gaze back at\n\" Edsa \" from the standpoint of the present, we get this\nfeeling that \" Edsa \" was, after all, not about a people\ntaking hold of their destiny, but only about a ruling elite ensuring their\nsurvival by a timely adjustment within their ranks. \n\n \n\nIt has become impossible to sustain the image of \" Edsa\n\" as a revolution.\n\n\nNot only has it not produced any meaningful change in the structure\nof property and power in our society, in truth, it has also not led to any\ndiscernible change in the faces of the people who own and run this country.\n\n\nThe same families and persons that dominated the nation 's economic\nand political landscape during the Marcos years still preside over our\nnational life.\n\n\nNo Marcos relative or crony has been sent to jail for corruption.\n\n\nNo Marcos military or police officer has been publicly confronted or\nconvicted for human rights violations.\n\n\nWorse, many people from the old regime who should be behind bars are\nnow occupying or running for public office. \n\n \n\nTo be sure, some stolen property has been quietly returned to the\ngovernment.\n\n\nAnd we are sometimes told about the aggregate value of such recovered\nassets.\n\n\nBut we have seen neither an itemized public accounting of these\nassets nor a description of the terms of their recovery.\n\n\nWe want to know if any deals were made between the government and\nthose who voluntarily returned stolen wealth.\n\n\nToday, without bothering to consult the people, the government is\ntrying to work out a compromise with the Marcos family so that a portion of\nthe assets the dictator stashed away in Swiss banks may be returned to the\ncountry as soon as possible.\n\n\nThe Supreme Court has convicted Imelda Marcos of graft, but she has\nyet to spend a day in prison.\n\n\nWas \" Edsa \" a lie, or are the Marcoses still in\npower? \n\n \n\nBut, above all, \" Edsa \" was about a nation 's\nredemption from the scourge of human rights violations, from the scandal of\ntorture, assassination and forced disappearances, and from the injustice of\nindefinite detention and arbitrary arrests.\n\n\nThat is why we cannot remember \" Edsa \" without\nasking how many human rights cases against the Marcos regime have been\nresolved.\n\n\nWe cannot celebrate \" Edsa \" without asking how many\nof those who have been amnestied for offenses committed during martial law\nhave confessed to their crimes and asked for forgiveness from those they have\nwronged. \n\n \n\nIn contrast, a country like South Africa, newly released from the\nshame of  apartheid  , has done much more in the last few\nyears to warrant a daily celebration of the freedom it now enjoys.\n\n\nThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission, headed by Bishop Desmond\nTutu, has been going through the painful process of bringing torturers and\nassassins face to face with their victims.\n\n\nThese encounters have been cathartic.\n\n\nFor most of the victims, they represent a necessary purifying closure\nof a very personal tragedy. \n\n \n\nIn a recent BBC documentary, Bishop Tutu was seen breaking down a\ncouple of times from the sheer anguish of listening to instances of cruel and\ndegrading punishment and watching their reenactment by those who originally\ncarried them out.\n\n\nAll this has been necessary, says the commission, not so much to\navenge past injury as to provide the occasion for victims to confront and to\nforgive their tormentors. \n\n \n\nWe have not attempted what the South Africans have done with\ntheir past because I think we are afraid that we might come face to face with\nour own individual complicity with the regime that victimized the nation.\n\n\nThis is a natural fear that we must overcome if we aspire to end the\ncycle of compromises and accommodations that have hobbled our nation 's\njourney into the future. \n\n \n\nDealing with the past is always a daunting task, whether for a\nperson or a nation.\n\n\nOn one hand, there is a constant need to go back to it to inspire us\nand to validate our present strivings.\n\n\nIn the process, we tend to fictionalize it.\n\n\nOn the other, there is a need to un-remember the past so that we can\nget on with our lives, and not allow imagined obligations to a heroic past to\nconstrain our inventiveness.\n\n\nIn the process, we repeat the errors of the past. \n\n \n\nThere is a lesson to derive from all this: Though history has\nmuch to teach us, a journey into our past should never leave us disgusted or\ndemoralized about the future.\n\n\nThe only way to avoid this is by gazing at the past from the clear\nvantage point of someone who has figured out the road to the future.\n\n\nPerhaps then, the only way to celebrate \" Edsa \"\nwithout feeling violated and disenchanted is by looking at it as a work in\nprogress, rather than as a project completed.  \n\n\n\n\n  The dark threads of human behavior  \n\n\n Randy David \n\n \n\nIN VARYING degrees, we sometimes behave in ways that mock the\nvery things we value.\n\n\nSome of us are shocked by the realization of what we are capable of\ndoing, even as we desperately scan our past for its dark origins.\n\n\nBut all too often, the quest for intelligibility in our actions\ncollides against the illusions we quickly weave around our actions.\n\n\nOur capacity for \" motivated irrationality &rdquo; is only\nmatched by our skill at self-deception.\n\n\nThus, our minds remain opaque to ourselves. \n\n \n\nLeo Echegaray will probably never understand what made him turn\nhis own 10-year-old daughter into a sexual object.\n\n\nAt some point, he may have deceived himself into thinking that she\nwas not his real daughter, and that he was really in love with her.\n\n\nNo one knows how he worked through the darker threads of his soul to\njustify what he was doing, or how he managed to conceal to himself the\nmeaning of his act.\n\n\nIn this daunting situation, he certainly is not alone. \n\n \n\nI suppose US President Bill Clinton will never understand why\nanyone as powerful, as clever and as attractive as he could ever find himself\ncaught in a potentially damaging relationship with a very insecure young\nwoman like Monica Lewinsky.\n\n\nLike Echegaray, he might have thought he could get away with it.\n\n\nBut that does not explain why and how he got into it.\n\n\nIf the meanings of our actions were always immediately transparent\nto us, we should never find ourselves in situations that could damage us.\n\n\n \n\nSome people may object to this comparison, for indeed in Clinton 's\ncase, we are dealing with two consenting adults, whereas in Echegaray 's we\nare face to face with an adult who raped his own child.\n\n\nBut the point I am making is that in both situations, we expect a\nrational human being to be able to restrain himself from doing anything so\nfoolish and self-destructive.\n\n\n \" It is because people often behave in bizarre ways,\"\n says Jonathan Lear in his book \" \" Open-minded:\nWorking out the logic of the soul, &rdquo; \"  \" ways\nwhich cause pain to themselves and others, ways which puzzle even the actors\nthemselves, that psychoanalysis commands our attention. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nMost Americans think that like any other human being with a\nproblem, Clinton may need therapy and personal counseling to help him sort\nout what is causing all the trouble within him.\n\n\nBut as president of the United States, they also believe he is doing\na great job, and there is no reason to expose him to further humiliation.\n\n\nRepublicans insist he is a criminal, a morally inept leader who lied\nbefore the nation and obstructed justice, and should therefore be tried and\nremoved from the presidency before he does further damage to it.\n\n\nThe polls show that the Republicans do not understand the mind of\nthe American nation. \n\n \n\nThe admirable sensibility shown by the American people on this\nissue is obviously born of compassion and humility in the face of the\nintractable threads of human behavior.\n\n\nIts opposite--arrogant knowingness--is what gets in the way of the\nkind of non-defensive self-understanding to which, Lear says, nations and\nindividuals must aspire. \n\n \n\nIt is true that reason demands that we defend our laws and our\ninstitutions if we must remain a community.\n\n\nWe should not flinch from the task of penalizing those who violate\nthe values of the community if we are to preserve some order in our social\nlives.\n\n\nBut reason also requires that we recognize the persistent\nunintelligibility of a great part of human behavior.\n\n\nThat we temper our inclination to punish with the recognition that\nall of us are potentially self-destructive and immoral, even if only in our\ndreams. \n\n \n\nObviously, I am saying all this not on behalf of Clinton who, I\nam certain, will not be impeached, but because of Echegaray, who I am afraid,\nwill not be spared.\n\n\nKilling him may or may not deter future rapists; it may or may not\nfrighten fathers who sexually abuse their daughters.\n\n\nBut one thing is certain: Killing him will not lead us any closer to\nan understanding of the dark inner threads and social contingencies that\npredisposed him and many others to commit the outrageous acts for which we\nsentence them to die. \n\n \n\nMaybe nothing will ever make us fully understand the ways of the\nhuman mind.\n\n\nBut this should give us all the more reason to moderate the\ncertainty that the imposition of the death penalty presupposes. \n\n \n\nDo we really know what it means to kill a human being, asks\nEdward Tivnan in his book, \" \" The Moral Imagination. &rdquo;\n\"\n\n\nTivnan brings up George Orwell 's story of a condemned man he was\nleading to the gallows while stationed with the colonial police in Burma.\n\n\nAs they marched, a dog suddenly appearing from nowhere approached\nthe prisoner and tried to lick his face.\n\n\n \" Everyone stood aghast,\"  Orwell recalls.\n\n\nAs they resumed their walk, the condemned man self-consciously\nstepped aside at one point to avoid a puddle.  \n\n \n\n \" It is curious, but till that moment I had never\nrealized what it means to destroy a healthy, conscious man.\n\n\nWhen I saw the prisoner step aside to avoid the puddle, I saw the\nmystery, the unspeakable wrongness, of cutting a life short when it is in\nfull tide.\n\n\nThis man was not dying, he was alive just as we were alive.\n\n\nHe and we were a party of men walking together, seeing, hearing,\nfeeling, understanding the same world; and in two minutes, with a sudden\nsnap, one of us would be gone -- one mind less, one world less... &rdquo;\n  \n\n \n\nMany Filipinos will likely tell Orwell that the world would be\nbetter off if permanently rid of the likes of Echegaray.\n\n\nOther nations do not think so.\n\n\nIt all depends on the self-image we hold as a people.",

{"text": "Int'l press has to cope with gov'ts, criminals  \n\n\n Amando Doronila \n\n \n\nTHE INTERNATIONAL Press Institute is meeting in Manila for the\nfirst time in its 47-year history, bringing together the editors and\npublishers of leading newspapers from all over the world.\n\n\nIts members represent mainly newspapers in democracies, with the\neditors sharing similar political values. \n\n \n\nThey are here to contemplate the fate of the freedom of the press\nin a globalized scale and the perils facing journalists covering news in\ndemocracies as well as in less tolerant and less participatory political\nsystems. \n\n \n\nThe choice of Manila as a venue of the conference is significant.\n\n\nThe Philippines is one of the few spots in Asia where freedom of the\npress is practiced with little inhibition and in the way freedom is\nunderstood by the established industrial democracies. \n\n \n\nThey understand press freedom without adjectives.\n\n\nUnlike other international forums where they torment the meaning of\n\" political freedom \" with qualifications such as \"\n\" Asian values, &rdquo; \" this group of editors and publishers\nare not bogged down in nit-picking over meanings. \n\n \n\nWhen they talk about freedom, they mean publication of newspapers\nwithout government licenses and pre-censorship ( overt or covert), a judicial\nsystem that is imbued with a liberal outlook in interpreting libel laws and\npolitical liberties, where journalists are not jailed for their political\nviews and where the political environment allows untrammeled access to\nsources of information. \n\n \n\nBecause journalists cover turbulent events both in politically\ntolerant and intolerant political systems, one of the IPI 's top concerns is\nthe physical risks faced by journalists and the killing of journalists in\nline of duty. \n\n \n\nThis is the context against which the IPI reported that each\nyear, 60 to 80 journalists are killed all over the world.\n\n\nDuring the past five years, 236 journalists were killed in Asia, 12\nof which were in the Philippines. \n\n \n\nThe IPI noted that journalists are increasingly being murdered\nbecause of critical reporting about people involved in crimes, not\nnecessarily critical reporting about governments. \n\n \n\nThe world has never been free of trouble spots and turbulent\nevents that include wars and rebellions in which journalists are killed in\nthe cross-fire with nothing to protect them except their ID that is worthless\ncompared with badges of the Red Cross and paramedics which are more respected\nby belligerents than press cards. \n\n \n\nRecently, a number of journalists were killed in Cambodia,\nBosnia, Algeria and in Africa which is often visited by political turbulence.\n\n\nThe deaths there are traditional risks for journalists.\n\n\nThe IPI has raised its concerns over this. \n\n \n\nBut what alarms the IPI is that more journalists die in the hands\nof drug lords, organized criminals and violent individuals than at the hands\nof murderous governments.\n\n\nThere is growing concern that governments are less able to protect\njournalists from the lawless and to mobilize their law enforcement apparatus\nto bring murderers to justice. \n\n \n\nThis is the case with the murder of 12 Filipino journalists\nduring the past five years, including that of the \" People 's Tonight\n\" news editor Danny Hernandez.\n\n\nOnly four of the 12 cases have been put to trial, and are still\ndragging in the courts. \n\n \n\nIn Cambodia, where the drug lords have a running battle with the\ngovernments, journalists are regular victims and fair game to political\nassassination. \n\n\n  Breakdown of law  \n\n \n\nThe rise in the victimization of journalists reflects the\nbreakdown of law enforcement in societies where incidence of killings of\njournalists is high. \n\n \n\nIn the past, the IPI 's main concern was to act as a lobby group\nto seek freedom of journalists who were jailed by intolerant and\nauthoritarian regimes.\n\n\nSometimes they succeeded in securing release of journalists from\ndetention, as was the case of the IPI interventions of journalists jailed by\nthe Marcos martial law regime. \n\n \n\nSometimes the intervention failed.\n\n\nIn any case, the concern was focused on governments rather than on\noutlaw groups and criminal organizations. \n\n \n\nTo be sure, the post-Marcos administrations have not jailed any\njournalists for their reporting and commentaries.\n\n\nIn particular, the Ramos administration has not used its powers to\ncurb press freedom, although it is not above manipulating journalists and\nmanaging the news. \n\n \n\nThe press can cope with manipulation and news management, but it\nis extremely vulnerable to assassinations by criminals in societies with\nineffectual judicial and law enforcement systems like that in the\nPhilippines. \n\n \n\nAdditionally, the press cannot truly be free if judicial systems\nare prone to decide against journalists who are sued by governments for\n\" offensive &rdquo; political and economic reporting, as in Singapore\nwhere the government always wins cases against journalists and judges trigger\nhappy in imposing fines and damages on them. \n\n\n  Evading issue  \n\n \n\nThus, when President Ramos addressed the IPI conference, he\nevaded the issue over which the IPI has expressed its concerns.\n\n\nRather, he engaged in worthless platitudes and diversionary chatter.\n\n\n \n\nWhile he described the journalists as \" \"\nendangered species &rdquo; \" - - which is an understatement--he\nswitched attention to the function of the press to report economic crisis\nwith more clarity and authoritative explanation. \n\n \n\nThe question of the importance of the press in illuminating\neconomic, social and political problems is a settled one.\n\n\nThat notion of responsibility is accepted by both the press and\ngovernments in democratic societies. \n\n \n\nWhile the press performance in this area is sometimes spotty,\nthere is at least a continuing correction on the part of the media on their\nshortcomings.\n\n\nBut in the case of press members being murdered by criminals with\ngovernments unable to bring them to trial, the journalists will just have to\nlive with the reality that they have to fend for themselves. \n\n \n\nNeither the IPI nor governments can help them.\n\n\nThe picture is that the press, no matter what all those platitudes on\npress freedom proclaim, is a high-risk occupation that has to cope with\ngovernments and criminals.  \n\n\n\n\n  LOOKING BACK  \n\n\n  Dreams that Rizal wrote of  \n\n\n Ambeth R. Ocampo \n\n \n\nMY fame ( or should I say notoriety) in academic circles stems\nfrom a controversial lecture I read in 1989 on Rizal 's dreams.\n\n\nIn my own clumsy way, I tried to make sense of the dreams Rizal\nrecorded in his diaries and letters and attempted to push the parameters of\nknowledge a bit further.\n\n\nHowever, they say that a little knowledge is dangerous and I am a\ncase in point. \n\n \n\nI was terribly mistaken in that ( in)famous lecture, so seven\nyears later I rewrote the lecture and tested it on both the Philippine\nPsychiatric Association and the Philippine Psychological Association in order\nto redeem myself.\n\n\nRizal 's dreams made me reflect on Rizal, Freud and the Failure of\nPsycho-History. \n\n \n\nWhen I began work on Rizal, everyone was very discouraging\nbecause it was believed that there was nothing new in Rizal studies, that\neverything about him had been covered by other scholars before.\n\n\nWell, I found and published the drafts of Rizal 's third and\nunpublished novel as well as other minor details that led one of my editors\nto describe my work as scraping the bottom of the Rizal barrel for \n tutong sa kaldero    .\n\n\nOne of the ways I sought to make sense of Rizal was to look into his\ndiaries, letters and assorted writings--all 25 published volumes--in search\nof Rizal 's dreams. \n\n \n\nThe little I remembered of my Psychology 100 class in college was\nthat dreams occur at night when the conscious gives way to the unconscious,\nthus insecurities and fears kept from other people during the day plague\ndreamers in their sleep.\n\n\nRizal was no exception, and we are fortunate that he recorded at\nleast 11 dreams in his letters and journals.\n\n\nThese were noted down in different places and different times from 21\nto 29 years old.\n\n\nSkeptical historians said these dreams are irrelevant, but then in my\namateur way I would consider them important in our study of Rizal because\nthey bothered him enough to be recorded. \n\n \n\nA closer look at these dreams reveals psychic or precognitive\nability.\n\n\nUndoubtedly psychic from childhood, Rizal remembers the time when as\na freshman medical student at the University of Santo Tomas he dreamed that\nhe was taking an exam when that was to take place a few days later, he woke\nup remembering the exam questions in his dream but didn't give it a thought.\n\n\nWhen he finally sat for the exam he was surprised and delighted to\ndiscover that the questions he saw in his dream were the very same ones in\nthe actual exam. \n\n \n\nNaturally, he related this to his elder brother Paciano, who it\nseems was also psychic because one night after   Simbang Gabi\n  Rizal related the dreams he was having about the family going\nthrough a period of trouble (   kaguluhan   ) but he\ncould not make out or tell whether the family would lose or gain from this\n\" trouble. &rdquo;\n\n\nPaciano who wrote Rizal in 1883 was reminded of this dream and\nrelated that he had similar dreams, but unlike Rizal 's which were vague,\nPaciano 's dreams were clear as to the outcome being misfortune and hardship\nthe Rizals would face in the future.\n\n\nHe even added:  \" . ...I 'm not much of a believer in\ndreams that occur in the darkness of sleep, I cannot believe in it although\nall this can happen. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nHistorians now know that misfortune did befall the Rizal family:\nEviction from Calamba, persecution and the death of their brother Jose. \n\n \n\nWhile Rizal was in Europe he surely heard of the advances in\npsychology brought out by Sigmund Freud 's then revolutionary theories and\nhis pioneering work in dream analysis.\n\n\nHence, Rizal in his time, was caught between a psychological and\nsuperstitious belief in dreams.\n\n\nRizal outwardly scoffed and actually laughed at his own dreams, but\nin his diaries and letters to close friends he related the dreams which\nfrightened him.\n\n\nHe left us, in his diaries and letters, some dreams that troubled him\nenough he put them down on paper.\n\n\nThese dreams must have been important. \n\n \n\nVery early on, Rizal had this consciousness of death and he\nbelieved he would not reach the age of 30.\n\n\nHe says in a letter to Paciano that dreams always regulated his\nconduct   [ ang aking mga panaginip ay siya na lamang nagaayos ng\naking mga hakbang]   . \n\n \n\nFrom the time Rizal left for Europe in 1892 till he wrote his\nnovels \"  \" Noli Me Tangere &rdquo;

Ocampo \n\n \n\nWhen I saw the front-page photos of the President and the tourism\nsecretary taking a raft down a raging river in Cagayan and hiking up to the\ncrater of Pinatubo, I couldn't help but think of all the travel accounts on\nthe Philippines that I have read over the years.\n\n\nNinth century Chinese travelers described pre-colonial Filipinos as\n\" \" barbarians. &rdquo; \"\n\n\nAntonio Pigafetta, the chronicler of the Magellan expedition, was\nfascinated by penis implements and asked to see these things.\n\n\nHowever, the Filipino  machos  suddenly turned\nmodest.\n\n\nPerhaps they were pulling Pigafetta 's leg and historians like myself\nhave never gotten the joke after five centuries. \n\n \n\nAlfred Marche in the 19th century took the first photograph of\nthe  sultan  of Sulu.\n\n\nJosephine Craig, a schoolteacher in the early 20th century, tried to\ndefine the distinct racial smell of Filipinos.\n\n\nThere are descriptions of Filipino character, the beauty of Mayon or\nTaal or Filipino   mestizas   .\n\n\nThere are accounts of food, drink, fiestas, cockfighting and \ncarabaos  . \n\n \n\nMost of these are foreign travel accounts on the Philippines and\nthe Filipinos.\n\n\nSurely, it would be good to read a Filipino point of view, but then\nwriters like Pedro Paterno, Jose Rizal, Antonio Luna and Marcelo H. del Pilar\nwere too busy writing home from Europe to let their relatives know what it\nwas like to be abroad. \n\n \n\nOne of the projects I hope to complete in my lifetime will be a\ncompilation of travel writing by Filipinos.\n\n\nAs a historian, I have relied heavily on accounts of the Philippines\nfrom foreign eyes.\n\n\nWouldn't it be fascinating to see the great capitals of the world -\nLondon, Paris, Madrid, New York, etc. - from the eyes of Filipinos?\n\n\nWouldn't it be interesting to see how Filipinos looked at their own\ncountry in the 19th century and contrast it with the views of foreign\ntourists. \n\n \n\nIf I had another lifetime to waste on research, I would dig up\nold travel brochures on the Philippines and try to see what was the selling\npoint of the Philippines before beaches and sex tours.\n\n\nZoilo Galang 's \" \" Encyclopedia of the Philippines,\n&rdquo; \" mostly compiled in the 1930s and whose last edition was\nprinted in 1950, has some hard-sell tourist material that will make Dick\nGordon  squirm.\n\n\nSample this: \n\n\n \" The Philippines beckons you.\n\n\nTraveler,   Mabuhay   !\n\n\nSee your country first!\n\n\n See the Philippines and then die happily. \n\n\nSuch is the call of the tropics. &rdquo;   \n\n \n\nI immediately associated this prewar blurb with dengue and the\nAbu Sayyaf today. \n\n \n\nThe Philippine Tourist Bureau even had an exact figure for the\nnumber of islands in the archipelago - 7,083 - while most brochures are vague\nand estimate that we have 7,100 islands, more or less, depending on whether\nyou count at high tide or low tide.\n\n\nThe Philippines was described as a  \" great jade\nnecklace across the throat of Asia...unspoiled vacation place...where winter\nis unknown...where life flows easily and sweetly...where the polo season\nlasts eight months...where countless contrasts greet the eye, amaze, astound\nand intrigue the senses,  etc., etc.  \" \n\n\nNow, that is what I call superlatives.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "2b38f9c7-8d62-417c-b9cd-57570e0be4e1", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.235534+00:00"}

Kumander Alladin, said he\njoined the MNLF to pursue development for the tri-people of Mindanao--the\nMuslims, Christians and the highlanders.\n\n\nHowever, he expressed his reservations regarding joint-ventures with\nother foreign countries for the Marsh 's development.\n\n\n  \" Kung development na makakabuti para sa lahat,\n  why\nshould I be against it? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThe MILF leadership sees the state of war as the result of\ngovernment 's aggressive thrust in implementing the\nBrunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East Asia Growth Area or BIMP-EAGA\nproject.\n\n\nGadzali Jaafar, MILF vice-chairman for Political Affairs, said the\ncurrent military offensive or state of martial law in Cotabato is a means to\n \" control the area.\" \n\n\nHe suspects it may also be part of the Malaca&ntilde;ang ploy to\nextend the President 's term. \n\n \n\nA splinter group of the MNLF, the MILF seeks independence.\n\n\nThe MNLF, on the other hand, batted for autonomy before it concluded\na peace agreement with the government last September. \n\n \n\nMILF leaders wanted to hold talks with then President Corazon\nAquino under the banner of the defunct National Unification Commission (\nNUC).\n\n\nBut they felt abandoned when Malaca&ntilde;ang stopped contacting\nthem after then Commissioner Haydee Yorac went to the South for a possible\npeace truce. \n\n \n\nExploratory peace talks between the government and MILF-- what\nAmperl refers to as  \" a matter of recognition from government\"\n - - are ongoing at present.\n\n\nThe conflict has socio-economic roots, because the benefits of\ndevelopment have yet to trickle down to the 10 million  Moro \npeople, most of whom are poor.\n\n\nThrough the years, the Maguindanaos saw how the Christian\nsettlements, especially those around the Marsh, developed at a fast pace.\n\n\nThey also witnessed how Christians built their business empires and\nestablished strong political bailiwicks. \n\n\n  The Liguasan Marsh Development Plan  \n\n \n\nThe 52,421-hectare or 524,2100,000 sq.m. Liguasan Marsh (\n\"  Ligawasan  \" - - Maguidanaon term for\n\" reservoir \" ) is situated in the central mainland of\nRegion 12 and part of Maguindanao Province and  Sultan \nKudarat Province of Region 11.\n\n\nIt is surrounded by the municipalities of Pikit, Kabacan, Cotabato\nand Pagalungan, Maguindanao in the north; Matalam M'lang Tulunan, all of\nCotabato and  Datu  Paglas, Maguindanao in the east; Gen.\nS. K. Pendatun in the south; and  Sultan sa Barongis  in the\nwest. \n\n \n\nA number of rivers flow into the Marsh.\n\n\nBesides the Pulangi which flows into the northwestern portion, seven\nother rivers converge in the area. \n\n \n\nThe Liguasan Marsh Development Framework Plan 1996-2025 targets a\n30-year development for the construction of sophisticated roads and bridges,\nirrigation, flood control, ports/wharves, water supply and communications.\n\n\nThe different rivers, on the other hand, will serve as centers for\nfish propagation and food production, recreational facilities, industrial\nwater supply and irrigation dams. \n\n \n\nRich aquatic and agricultural resources from the Marsh is being\nshared by the municipalities of Pikit, M'lang, Tulunan, Matalam, Kabacan,\nMidsayap, Libungan, Pigcawayan, all of Cotabato;  Datu \nPaglas,  Datu  Piang,  Sultan sa Barongis \n, S. K. Pendatun, Buluan and Kabuntalan in Maguindanao, and Lambayong in\nSultan Kudarat. \n\n \n\nFormer media consultant to President Ramos and incumbent M'Lang\nmunicipal mayor Emmanuel 'manny' Pi&ntilde;ol, averred he first revived the\nidea of developing the Liguasan Marsh when the town had its first kidnapping\nincident in 1992. \n\n \n\nDuring the monthly meeting of  barangay  captains,\nhe claimed the Pi&ntilde;ols, ( his father is a former mayor)  \"\nshowed to the whole people of Cotabato how kidnapping was stopped. &rdquo;\n\n\n\nAs the concurrent chairman of the development committee that will\nimplement the Liguasan Marsh Plan, Pi&ntilde;ol 's main concern is to draw\ninvestors to the Marsh. \n\n \n\nPast administrations from the Commonwealth period up to the late\n80s attempted to develop the Marsh.\n\n\nBut these efforts were stymied by the volatile peace and order\nproblem in surrounding areas. \n\n \n\nThe  Moro  people firmly resisted Spanish and\nAmerican colonialism and Japanese aggression.\n\n\nThe Quezon administration, however, changed the  Moro \npeople 's way of life when it allowed Christians to settle in their homeland.\n\n\n \n\nPrior to the great exodus of emigrants from Luzon and Visayas\nduring the Commonwealth period, the  Moro  people and\nscattered indigenous peoples comprised the populace in Mindanao.\n\n\nAs a result to that policy, today the province of Cotabato is\ndominated by three major ethno-linguistic groups: the Ilonggos ( 35%),\nCebuanos ( 30%) and the Maguindanaos ( 17%).\n\n\nBagobos, Manobos and other indigenous peoples account for 8%. \n\n \n\nWith the Ramos vision of fulfilling Mindanao as the \n\" Land of Promise\"  , a blueprint for Mindanao 's development\nhas been laid down consisting of flagship programs and projects including the\nBIMP-EAGA, SOCSARGEN and the Basilan Integrated Development Project. \n\n \n\nThe Liguasan Marsh development, as part of that grand plan,\nbasically aims to uplift the economic lot of people at the grassroots,\ntargetting especially the Muslims.\n\n\nThe local government of Cotabato in 1996 puts poverty incidence in\nthe province at 46.73% out of the total 155,093 families, relatively lower\nthan 1991 at 61.5%.\n\n\nFamilies derive their main livelihood from agri-based entrepreneurial\nactivities. \n\n \n\nAround the Marsh, inhabitants are classified as marginal\nfishermen, mostly Muslim.\n\n\nPi&ntilde;ol explained that historically the Marsh has been a place\nof exile for \" socially-unacceptable &rdquo; native Maguindanaos.\n\n\nAlthough conceding that the area is controlled by the MILF, he was\nquick to point out that  \" not all of them are MILF\"  .\n\n\nPi&ntilde;ol 's rationale for pushing the Liguasan Marsh project is\n \" to teach these people how to explore the resources and\ndevelop the area. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nPi&ntilde;ol is also fast-tracking the development of Liguasan\nMarsh before President Ramos 's term ends because he is unsure if the next\nPresident will understand the importance of the project.\n\n\nIn a dialogue with 37  barangay  captains, he\nannounced his intention to run as congressional candidate for the first\ndistrict next year to assure the continuity of programs he has already begun\nin the area. \n\n \n\nSupport for the development plan has been committed by the\nnational government and the private sector.\n\n\nThe New Zealand government has also committed financial assistance.\n\n\nPi&ntilde;ol has submitted the plan to the National Economic\nDevelopment Authority ( NEDA) for full completion of the feasibility studies.\n\n\n\n  Complications  \n\n \n\nThe state of war in Cotabato province has placed various sectors\nand stakeholders in the same mire.\n\n\nThe rich farmlands of Cotabato have been abandoned by both Muslim and\nChristian peasants.\n\n\nAs of last week, according to Jaafar, there were already 80,000\nMuslims who had evacuated to different refugee centers to escape bombings and\ndestruction of lives and properties. \n\n \n\nSome Muslim elders frankly admitted they were more scared of the\nAFP than the MILF because when they come, they bomb and attack without mercy.\n\n\n \n\nA truckload of sand from the municipal government of Pikit sent\nto the interior was discovered to contain rice and other goods, implicating\nits Muslim mayor as supporter of the MILF.\n\n\nBut employees from the office of the local government said the mayor\ncannot be blamed because the MILF members are his relatives.\n\n\nIn a Muslim crisis-situation, they say blood is thicker than\npolitics. \n\n \n\nThe Diocese of Kidapawan, always in the forefront of human rights\nprotection, dispatched its second relief mission to Kabacan last week to give\naway a truckload of rice, dried fish, clothing and medicines to elders, women\nand children.\n\n\nThe evacuation centers in Tunggol, Pagagawan and Salapungan were\nreplete with uncertainty and mirrored the extent of the Muslims ' poverty.\n\n\n \n\nMost of the evacuees in Kabacan came from the areas of\nPagalungan,  Datu  Paglas, Pikit, Lumayog and Ugalingan.\n\n\n \n\nElementary graders have stopped going to school.\n\n\nTeachers in the school-turned-evacuation center were saddened by the\nsituation that would deprive the Muslim children the opportunity to learn.\n\n\nIn fact, they told of how their pupils, children of poor peasant\nMuslim families, would go to school with rice and \" Silver Swan\n\" ( brand of soy sauce) as meal.\n\n\nMajority of the Moslem children often do not reach intermediate\nschooling because they are forced to lend a hand in production. \n\n \n\nChurch workers bewail the brash attitude of some Muslims,\nespecially those who have had little education.\n\n\nIn Pagagawan, non-evacuees threatened to block the truck of goods if\nthey did not get their share.\n\n\nFr. Lito Garcia, parish priest of Kabacan, explained that the\nwar-situation normally breeds the dole-out mentality among the poor Muslims\nwho are assured of their meals for at least several days. \n\n \n\nIn Salapungan, evacuee statistics dropped from 900 on the first\nday of refuge to 112 the next few days.\n\n\nAsked where the men are, as those present were mostly elders, women,\nchildren and frail youth, the answers were standard:  \" they 're\nin the farm. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nSome of Kabacan 's church workers deny they are feeding the\nrebels. \n\n \n\nAn LGU employee who requested anonymity disclosed that the powers\nnow being enjoyed by the commanders of the MILF have made the  datus\n mere figureheads of authority.\n\n\nWhen commanders swoop down on villages to take away the young men as\ntrainees, the families can only protest in silence.\n\n\nThe cycle of violence continues, said this source, as the fathers and\ngrandfathers of these young men were the same fighters during military and\nMuslim encounters in the 70s and 80s. \n\n \n\nThe tense atmosphere has serious repercussions on investments,\nsaid the two sources from the provincial capitol.\n\n\nThey said the towns of Carmen, Pikit and some parts of Kabacan were\nwell-off municipalities.\n\n\nRajamuda, the so-called MILF camp, had facilities like schools,\nhospitals,  etc.  \n\n \n\nWhen investments were infused in the past years, Cotabato City\ngreatly improved, they said.\n\n\nThere was steady growth for Cotabato from 1995 to 1997, they\nrecalled, but this was highly concentrated in the second district, the\nso-called \" \" safe areas &rdquo; \" .\n\n\nOverall, despite the peace problem, the whole of Cotabato from\n1995-1996 got some &peso;1 billion in investments, &peso;518 of this placed\nin the agro-based sector. \n\n \n\n \" All the mechanisms for investments and marketing\nin Cotabato province have already been in place.\n\n\nIn fact, we have the Cotabato Investment Promotions Center.\n\n\nAside from this, the Investments Code of Cotabato Province is ready\nfor implementation\",  the sources said. \n\n \n\nBut Fr. Ronnie Villamor, administrator of the Diocese of\nKidapawan, understands why the Maguindanao situation has gotten out of hand.\n\n\nBudget-wise, he said, Mindanao receives a minimal allocation for\ninfrastructure and services compared to Luzon and Visayas.\n\n\n \" Yet Mindanao feeds the rest of the population &rdquo; ,\n he said.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "0994ce24-9577-4a12-ac85-f36af76f31e5", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.236848+00:00"}
{"text": "The hospital: Mirror of the Filipino soul  \n\n\n Anne Marie Montemar-Oriondo \n\n \n\nThe year 1998 being the Philippine Centennial year, questions are\noften raised about what constitutes the Filipino soul.\n\n\nWho is Filipino?\n\n\nWhat is he  really  like?\n\n\nWhat makes him special?\n\n\nThough there are a variety of ways to answer these questions, may I\nsuggest a rather unorthodox means?\n\n\nGo visit a hospital! \n\n \n\nYes, I mean it, a hospital!\n\n\nTrue, a hospital evokes images and feelings associated with pain and\ndread, but its very nature makes it a suitable showcase of the Filipino\nspirit at its best.\n\n\nBecause life is vulnerable and precarious here, thoughts, feelings,\nand actions are laid bare.\n\n\nIn a hospital, where people sense the urgency of time and the\nlimitations of life, there is no need to pretend nor to trivialize one 's\nself.\n\n\nThe hospital, in this sense, is not a hypocritical place - - what you\nsee is what you get.\n\n\nAnd in the case of Filipinos, what you get is a spirit shining\nthrough and soaring high. \n\n \n\nI remember once, when I was on duty, I opened the door of a\nhospital room and a motley group of teens, kids, and adults crowded their way\npast me.\n\n\n \" Bye and thanks for visiting!\"  waved the\nappreciative lady who I correctly surmised to be the patient 's wife.\n\n\nBefore I could enter, I saw another group down the corridor headed\nfor the room.\n\n\nSeeing my amused look, the wife smiled and said, nodding towards the\ngroup that had just left,  \" They are from my husband 's side.\n&rdquo; \n\n\nThen pointing to the new group,  \" They 're from my side\nof the family. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nAs I checked on the patient 's vital signs inside the room, I\ncouldn't help but notice the scene which has since become familiar - - the\ntable was stacked with biscuits, cakes, fruits, flowers given by visitors.\n\n\nThe food was not for the patient because he was still on orders not\nto eat!\n\n\nSoon the new group settled snugly into the room, greeting the\npatient, chatting up a storm, and later munching on the food which the wife\noffered.\n\n\nThrough all the seeming racket, I noted the relieved, contented look\non the patient 's face.\n\n\nWhy, it was just as if they were just in the   sala\n  of his own home! \n\n \n\nThis encompassing, pervasive sense of home - - of a living haven,\nof a tender refuge - - is imprinted in the heart of the Filipino.\n\n\nIt is just as much an attitude, a frame of mind, that enables him to\nimbue warmth and a sense of intimacy wherever he goes.\n\n\nForeigners often say that what they like most about Filipinos is that\nthey treat their guests  \" like family, &rdquo;  and\nseeing Filipinos behave in a hospital, one realizes how correct they are.\n\n\nIn the same vein, I remember a letter which my mom had received from\nan American patient.\n\n\nShe had undergone rehabilitation with my physical therapist sister,\nand she was so profuse about my sister having treated her far more than a\n\" mere &rdquo; patient that she even thanked my mom for having raised\nsuch an affectionate daughter! \n\n \n\nAnother Filipino quality that a hospital best draws out is the\nability to sympathize, to be compassionate.\n\n\nRarely have I seen a Filipino  alone  , whether for\ncheck-ups with doctors or when confined.\n\n\nI remember questioning an elderly man once about a mass in his\ninguinal area.\n\n\nHis daughter could recount all the details pertinent to the case with\nremarkable accuracy!\n\n\nOne of the greatest consolations of a doctor in the Philippines,\nthen, is that he has very cooperative and zealous partners in the care of his\npatients.\n\n\nWhether it be an out-patient, a confined or a recuperating one, he\ncan be sure that the wife, sibling, friend, whoever-it-be will see to it that\nthe patient conforms to all of the doctor 's orders. \n\n \n\nI have also seen relatives and friends remaining for days in the\nintensive care unit, literally sharing in the pain of their loved ones.\n\n\nFrom the street urchin, the village goon, to the neighborhood\nbeautician, a friend, a   barkada   , a relative will\nbe there, even alternating among themselves, from admission to discharge.\n\n\nAnd in the province, it is a common sight to see a jeep load or two\nof relatives and friends accompanying a patient to the emergency room from\nthe  barrios  !\n\n\nComplete strangers will also bring their fellow-Filipinos to the E.R.\nafter vehicular accidents.\n\n\nIf health is indeed wealth, how sweetly ironic that it is during his\ntime of illness that a Filipino realizes how richly blessed he is! \n\n \n\nAnd then there is the Filipino 's legendary faith.\n\n\nNext to a church perhaps, the best place to witness Filipino faith up\nclose is in the hospital.\n\n\nOne can see it in the crucifixes, rosaries, or statues of saints\nplaced by the patient or his family near his bedside.\n\n\nOne can see it in patients clutching rosary beads and wearing\nscapulars  en route  to an operation.\n\n\nOne can see it in prayer books tucked under the patient 's pillow.\n\n\nOne can feel it in the silence of relatives praying for their loved\nones ' health in the hospital chapel.\n\n\nAnd one can sense it the most in the quiet but faithful surrender of\npatients when they are told that their illness is terminal.\n\n\nFilipinos have an abiding faith that God will pull them through tough\ntimes, even death, but they have as much resolute faith when God decides\notherwise. \n\n \n\nFilipinos are also a grateful people.\n\n\nWe know how to be thankful, and do so profusely.\n\n\nDoctors know this very well.\n\n\nI once accompanied a patient for referral at a hospital, and the next\nday his father gave me three hens.\n\n\nNo matter how much I protested that they were too much, he was\ninsistent that I have them.\n\n\nI once helped a neurologic patient avail of charity service at a\nreputable hospital and I have since lost track of the many pineapples,\n  langka   , avocados and bananas that his family has\ngiven me!\n\n\nIt is rightfully said that the Filipino has experienced just about\nthe worst of everything - - floods, drought, poverty, even volcanic ash from\nout of nowhere - - but he has survived smiling.\n\n\nAfter being in hospitals for a while, one can understand why.\n\n\nDespite all of life 's adversities, the Filipino knows how to look\nheavenward and still say,  \" Thank You for life itself. &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\nThis sense of home, great compassion, faith in His God, and\nprofound gratitude, all of those qualities Filipinos can be proud of - - the\nhospital serves as a mirror of the best of the Filipino spirit.\n\n\nPerhaps if each and every Filipino were to take it upon himself to\npractice these outstanding qualities everyday, we would be a truly healthy\nnation, in every possible way.  \n\n\n\n\n  Dissecting Rights and Privileges  \n\n\n Wihelmina Orozco \n\n \n\nA bus driver was weaving in and out of the traffic at a fast\npace.\n\n\nAt first, a passenger cautioned the driver in an indirect manner but\ntheir conversation lengthened to include discussions of rights and\nprivileges:  \n\n\nPassenger: Mama, nahihilo ako sa pagmamaneho ninyo.\n\n\nDriver: Ale, sumakay kayo ng taksi\n\n\nPassenger: Mama, nagbayad ako nang husto.\n\n\nDriver: Eto ang bayad ninyo.\n\n\nLumipat na lang kayo ng ibang sasakyan.\n\n\nPassenger: Mama, karapatan kong makarating sa aking pupuntahan sa\nisang matiwasay at mapayapang paraan.\n\n\nDriver: E angal kayo ng angal.\n\n\nPassenger: Mama, ang bus ay pang public service, hindi private\nservice.\n\n\nKailangang pangalagaan ninyo ang buhay ng mga pasahero ninyo.\n\n\nAng tawag sa ginagawa ninyo ay reckless driving kahit na itanong pa\nnatin sa traffic enforcer. \n\n \n\nThe conversation ended.\n\n\nYet, this tug-of-war between rights and privileges is replicated in\nmany instances.\n\n\nFor example, when we pay for and ride a plane to Bacolod we are\nexercising our right to travel.\n\n\nBeing able to listen to beautiful music inside the plane and being\nserved are privileges or perks that an airline gives to attract passengers.\n\n\nOur right extends only to being brought from Manila to that city at a\nparticular time and date.\n\n\nHowever, when the flight gets delayed, and we miss our lunch, then it\nis our right to be served meals by the crew and to be provided with lodging\nwhile awaiting boarding if it is a delayed evening flight.\n\n\nOtherwise we can charge the airline with business malpractice.\n\n\nBut my claim about our  right to mobility  extends to the\ntravel tax being leveled against all outgoing citizens.\n\n\nAren't fees for travel abroad violative of our right to travel?\n\n\nSupposing we cannot pay them, are we going to be barred from\ntraveling despite our having a ticket to our destination?\n\n\nThe fees were levied based on law issued by Marcos in trying to\ninhibit those so-called \" subversives &rdquo; from using a foreign base\nto attack his human rights abuses and to raise funds for his family 's\npersonal aggrandizement.\n\n\nSo it would be really important to challenge the legality of that law\nnow. \n\n \n\n  Right to work:   On the aspect of labor,\nour Constitution grants everyone the right to work.\n\n\nNow, even if an agreement is reached between the Philippines (\nthrough the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration) and the foreign\ncountry with regard to the workers ' treatment, still workers will be at the\nmercy of the latter - - in terms of work conditions, health care and shelter.\n\n\nMore fundamentally in particular, many of our workers are now in the\nMiddle East and Asian countries known for suspending and violating basic\nhuman rights such as the basic freedom of expression, of assembly, of\nreligion, and other human rights.\n\n\nAs the Department of Labor and Employment is supposed to uphold the\ndignity of labor and guarantee basic human rights, should we not make the\nPOEA redundant, now? \n\n \n\n  Artistic freedom:   Another issue is the\nfreedom of expression guaranteed by the Constitution, the method, either in\nprint or through other artistic institutions that allow every individual to\nexpress himself/herself.\n\n\nHowever, art grants should be democratically disbursed to many\nindividuals and groups.\n\n\nThe system of coddling resident companies for more than one year at\ncultural institutions negates the democratic process. \n\n \n\n  Marcosian laws:   A current legal case is\ntesting our knowledge of our rights in the light of those laws produced\nbefore and under the martial law regime.\n\n\nA certain real estate company is trying to collect compensation for\nreclaiming, before martial law was institutionalized, the lands now being\noccupied by the Cultural Center of the Philippines.\n\n\nFacts of the case refer to the company 's violating bidding\nprocedures which nullified their right to continue to work on reclamation.\n\n\nThe question is do we interpret the law now in the light of past or\ncurrent laws?\n\n\nMarcos solely enacted certain laws providing a crony the privilege to\ncontinue reclamation.\n\n\nDid he violate the right of the real estate company to just\ncompensation by expropriating the land?\n\n\nI think in so far as the act did not divest the people of the right\nto own the land and enjoy its uses, then it is considered lawful.\n\n\nBut if the reclamation resulted in the land being owned and its use\nbeing enjoyed by private individuals and companies, then it is highly\nunlawful.\n\n\nAs the case stands now, the reclaimed land is still government, and\nnot crony land, although some elite parties could be enjoying the use of that\npiece of land.\n\n\nOn a broader basis, the new Constitution of 1987 would point to the\nland reclamation as violative of the right of the people to access to aquatic\nand marine resources. \n\n \n\n  Right to a peaceful life:   Our rights in\nour domestic surroundings are worthwhile dissecting, also.\n\n\nFor example, children have the right to be free and happy.\n\n\nThey can play, sing and make noise if they want to.\n\n\nBut if they are playing in an area between two tall buildings and\ntheir voices reverberate for one hour or more, causing disturbance to other\ntenants, then it is the time for the parents to tell them off, that they are\nviolating their neighbor 's  right to peaceful living  .\n\n\nFor that matter, radios blaring at a certain number of decibels and\nfrom 9 p.m. onwards is considered nuisance.\n\n\nAlong the same vein, a tenant can have as many cars he or she wants.\n\n\nBut as soon as the second car appropriates the space provided for\nthe next tenant, then the former is already violating the space of the\nlatter.\n\n\nThese are minor details that could escalate to big conflicts if not\nproperly examined and resolved among residents in one community.\n\n\nAnother example is a grave concern of women 's rights advocates:\nwhen a person physically abuses another inside the home, then even the\nneighbors have the  right to intervene  because he or she is already\ncommitting an abuse of another person 's life.\n\n\nIntervention can range from bringing the police to stop the act,\nbarging into the home to control the abuser, up to the extent of teaching the\nvictim his/her right to separate from that abuser, no matter if they are\nmarried or related by affinity or consanguinity.\n\n\nBy the way, I wonder if priests deliver sermons along this line.\n\n\nThey would ease a lot of the problems of government welfare and\nhuman rights agencies by suggesting to their flock how to treat each other\nand behave more humanely, especially during life-threatening situations.\n\n\nAnyway, what the priests could be neglecting, active women have\ntaken over proficiently.\n\n\nWomen 's consciousness-raising groups have discovered that teaching\nwomen their right to say when, where, and how to receive verbal and physical\nexpressions of love from, is important for raising their self-esteem, and\nkeeping a harmonious relationship, with their partner.\n\n\nIn other words, they are emphasizing that intimate relationships\nrequire a symbiotic interaction. \n\n \n\n  Punitive or preventive?:   A most recent\nhuman rights case is the Manila mayor 's directive of painting red all homes\nof suspected drug pushers and users.\n\n\nHow lawful or rightful is his action?\n\n\nIf  all  the tenants of the homes are guilty, not suspected\nof drug pushing, and that they have pending cases in court for such crimes,\nhis action looks legal; but if not, is this not a case of witchhunting,\nauguring or foretelling a kind of rightist administration that could trample\non our other human rights in the long run?\n\n\nWe understand that the mayor means well but his act looks punitive\nrather than preventive of crimes, apart from causing tension and anxieties in\nthe communities.\n\n\nBesides, many other healthy ways can be devised for solving the drug\nproblem, if only the expertise of social scientists would be tapped.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "7c909056-b0e5-49f1-9fc0-4b6b7bc99f7d", "added":

{"text": "So, your kids are addicted to computer games  \n\n\n Cecile G. Garcia \n\n \n\nWHERE in the World is Carmen San Diego? \n\n \n\nTo find out, you must go on a heart-stopping, mind-boggling chase\nthat takes you all over the world, from mystical Marrakesh to good, old\nManila, picking up clues along the way. \n\n \n\nIf you don't know, Carmen San Diego heads an international\nsyndicate of thieves.\n\n\nThe hunt is long even as time runs out.\n\n\nThe prey is elusive.\n\n\nYou may or may not catch her. \n\n \n\nCarmen San Diego first emerged in 1987 in a black and white\nedition.\n\n\nShe has since undergone a series of revisions and been transformed\ninto colored graphics on CD-ROMs, CDs, cartridges and diskettes.\n\n\nThe espionage game is now a classic among game buffs - - including\nadults.\n\n\nIt 's a great favorite because while searching for San Diego, you\nalso get to brush up on your geography. \n\n \n\nBarely a decade after computer games first invaded our homes via\nthe Nintendo family computer, countless have been invented and re-invented.\n\n\n \n\nDr. Concepcion Liwag, Ph.D. ( University of Chicago), an\nassistant professor of developmental and cognitive psychology at Ateneo and a\nchild therapist, calls these games a \" \" phenomenon. &rdquo;\n\" \n\n \n\nDr. Allan Bernardo, Ph.D. ( Yale University), also a cognitive\npsychologist and current chair of the Department of Psychology at UP Diliman,\ndescribes them as  \" a reality we must accept because computer\ntechnology is here to stay and will probably be part of our lives for the\nnext half century. &rdquo;  \n\n\n  Interact  \n\n \n\nWithin their sub-specialty, cognitive psychology, Liwag and\nBernardo have investigated what goes on in the mind.\n\n\nBoth agree that computer games  per se  are not\nbad. \n\n \n\n \" There has been a quantum leap between TV and\ncomputer games,\"  says Liwag.\n\n\n \" Those games are less passive.\n\n\nChildren interact.\n\n\nThey don't just sit and watch.\n\n\nLearning is more effective.\n\n\nThey solve problems, make quick decisions, apply previous learning to\nnew situations.\n\n\nCertain skills are honed. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" There is also a greater sense of self-efficacy,\n&rdquo;  Liwag adds.\n\n\n \" They are in control, they can make things happen.\n\n\nIt 's also fun. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThe other side of the coin: As a child psychologist, Liwag would\nhave children playing hop-scotch, running, climbing trees, exploring the\nworld instead of being cooped up in an air-conditioned room competing with a\nmachine. \n\n \n\n \" Computer games could be cutting away time from\nother outside activities,\"  says Liwag.\n\n\n \" They 're interacting with a different kind of\nreality.\n\n\nImages on a screen are virtual reality.\n\n\nThey should be interacting more with their parents, siblings,\nfriends.\n\n\nThey may gain self-efficacy and control but in what respect?\n\n\nWe don't want to develop skills in a vacuum or apart from values.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nBernardo of UP says there are no hard and fast rules, especially\nbecause today 's children have been around computers from day one. \n\n\n  No fear  \n\n \n\n \" They grew up with these machines which are\nfamiliar fixtures in their homes, &rdquo;  concurs Liwag. \n\n \n\nAccording to Rachel Pesta&ntilde;o, marketing manager of Future\nKids Computer Learning Center ( Loyola Heights), kids start as early as three\nyears old.\n\n\nLos Angeles-based Future Kids is a worldwide franchise with over\n1,500 schools in the United States, Europe and Southeast Asia. \n\n \n\n \" Kids have no fear of the computer,\"  says\nPesta&ntilde;o.\n\n\n \" They 're curious and interested and want to explore.\n\n\nThey 're brought in by their parents but we haven't had one who 's\nafraid or indifferent to computers.\n\n\nAt three, a child learns how to turn on the machine, use the mouse (\na pointing device) and exit. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nSmall wonder that any child given the tools - - hardware and\nsoftware - - can tackle almost any computer game. \n\n \n\nWhile every game is different, all require some degree of\nengagement.\n\n\nHowever, Bernardo points out that IQ is not a prerequisite.\n\n\n \" Each game needs a specific skill which does not\nnecessarily have direct relation to IQ,\"  he says.\n\n\n \" The more you play it, the more adept you become.\n\n\nYou develop techniques, strategies, short cuts. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nSome friends of his, Bernardo recounts, did an experiment on\n\" Tetris \" or \" Brick Game \" .\n\n\nIn \" Tetris \" , bricks of different shapes have to\nfall at a certain rate into their proper places to form a structure ( the\ngoal of the game).\n\n\nIn principle, it 's similar to a jigsaw puzzle or lego.\n\n\nBut one is under time pressure and eye-hand coordination is very\nimportant.\n\n\nBernardo 's friends discovered that \" Tetris \" is\nnot intellectually demanding and affects only one specific ability - - motor\nskills. \n\n\n  Addicting  \n\n \n\nStill, Bernardo shares Liwag 's apprehension that this ' 90s\nphenomenon could be robbing children of other rewarding activities. \n\n \n\nSays Bernardo:  \" Though there is no element in\ncomputer games that can be addicting, any activity that engages the mind and\nthe person can be so, just like crossword puzzles, reading novels, watching\nTV.\n\n\nThey can eat up a lot of your time and take you away from other\nthings. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nSo far, he clarifies, there are no reported global effects of\ncomputer games.\n\n\nThe effects depend on the characteristics of game and the extent to\nwhich an individual - - a child - - indulges.\n\n\n \" He could be intensely engaged, &rdquo;  he\nsays.\n\n\n \" He could play relentlessly, with abandon,\nuncontrolled, non-reflective.\n\n\nThis could pose a reason for concern. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThere should be deeper concern when the child is engrossed in\nviolent computer games which are rampant.\n\n\nIf ladies are passionately enamored of ballroom dancing, kids,\ngenerally boys, are wild over \" Street Fighter \" , \"\nMortal Kombat \" , \" Killer Instinct \" , \"\nRock Man X \" , \" Resident Evil \" , \" Super\nMario \" and \" Children of the Atom \" , said to be\none of the latest.\n\n\nThey 're too many to enumerate. \n\n\n  Magazines  \n\n \n\nThe craze - - if it is merely that - - has resulted in the\npublication of five US magazines dedicated entirely to computer games.\n\n\nTopping the list are \" Electronic Gaming Monthly \"\nand \" EGM2 ( Existing Games Magazine) \" .\n\n\nBoth are quickly sold out at Filbar 's in Quad II at Glorietta\ndespite the cost - - &peso;225 per copy.\n\n\nThe rest are not doing so bad either. \n\n \n\nSchool boys devour these magazines like chocolate bars or pizza.\n\n\nWhy not?\n\n\nThey 're given passwords, codes, tips, clues on how to win.\n\n\nNo evidence of peer jealousy here as they willingly exchange\nknowledge, gems of wisdom as it were.\n\n\nThere is a bond here, a kinship: All of them have one objective - -\nto vanquish the enemy, to eliminate, eradicate, to kill. \n\n \n\nThe urge to win is understandable because winning endows the\nchild - - or anyone - - with a sense of power.\n\n\nBut when the motives are not clear to the child, says Bernardo, you\ncould have problems. \n\n \n\n \" To the child the effects of violence are not\nreal, &rdquo;  he says.\n\n\n \" You wonder how this will translate into other\ndomains.\n\n\nThe child engages in it without knowing why.\n\n\nHe does not see the pain, the loss, all the other negative things\nassociated with violence.\n\n\nWhen violence is decontextualized and is removed from reality, there\ncould be no feeling, no regard for cause or consequence.\n\n\nIf the child is exposed to this, he grows up with a very warped view\nof violence.\n\n\nEverything is discarded, including values. &rdquo;  \n\n\n  Violence  \n\n \n\nOf course, the technology is laudable.\n\n\nWith the advent of the CD-ROM for PCs, actual photographs can now be\nincorporated with the graphics.\n\n\nThere 's every reason to be enticed: They are more real, more\ncolorful and accessible with a mere click of a button. \n\n \n\nLiwag expounds:  \" Once they win and succeed,\nchildren feel a sense of mastery.\n\n\nThere is also the challenge.\n\n\nMost of the games go on to higher levels.\n\n\nSome are designed to be monotonous.\n\n\nThe monotony itself can keep them glued to the screen.\n\n\nThey don't have to think. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nA number of violent computer games do not require that much\nthinking, opines Bernardo.\n\n\n \" Which is why some kids play them unceasingly, with\ntotal abandon.\n\n\nResearch shows that certain children seem more impulsive, are unable\nto delay gratification.\n\n\nThey get involved in a particular activity and they don't let go.\n\n\nIt 's not abnormal.\n\n\nThese children tend to get addicted if not regulated. &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\nA child 's mind can absorb information but, unlike an adult 's,\nhow far can the young mind process that information?\n\n\nA nine-year-old boy says blood spurting from an enemy 's maimed body\non the screen is not real anyway.\n\n\nThe boy sounds nonchalant. \n\n \n\nInnocently, he brags about having his own TV, a Super Nes, a\nSony PlayStation ( one of the latest in hardware) and a Game Boy he carries\naround.\n\n\nOne of his favorites is \" Killer Instinct \" , and\nhas been playing since he was two. \n\n \n\nGiven the fact that these games are churned out and distributed\nwith near frenzy by manufacturers driven by less than sublime goals - - they\nare alleged to be monolithic conglomerates - - it 's not surprising that\nthere is not much worry about substance or content. \n\n \n\n \" We have reached the age of virtual reality,\"\n says Liwag.\n\n\n \" There 's no turning back.\n\n\nWe can't fight computer age.\n\n\nBut, we have to fight for certain values. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nA whiff of consolation to lower-income families: The problem of\nviolence in computer games is generally found among the affluent, since\ncomputer games are an expensive hobby. \n\n\n  &peso;30,000 up  \n\n \n\nNowadays, a PC would cost anywhere from &peso;30,000 up,\ndepending on the model.\n\n\nA handy, lightweight and impressive notebook gets hefty at\n&peso;66,000 ( an \" Apple Macintosh \" ) .\n\n\nAt \" Astro-Vision \" at Megamall, which sells both\nhardware and software, you have to shell out &peso;15,600 for a \"\nNintendo 64 \" , an updated version of previous ones.\n\n\nLess luxurious and very saleable is the \" Sony Play-Station\n\" - - relatively more affordable at &peso;11,700. \n\n \n\nSweet comfort it is that these prized gadgets cost less the\nlonger they are on the market.\n\n\nFor all their cyber-age sounding names such as \" Nintendo 64\n\" , \" Super Nes \" , \" Super Famicon\n\" , \" Sega Saturn \" and \" Sony PlayStation\n\" , they 're all designed and built for recreation via computer\ngames.\n\n\nLike their forebear, the family computer, they are attached to TV.\n\n\n \n\nSoftware can cost as much as &peso;3,000, particularly the\noriginal cartridge for \" Nintendo 64 \" .\n\n\nPirated copies, whether CDs or cartridges, cost much less. \n\n \n\nAccording to store owners, violent games are the absolute top\ndrawers, with sports games such as \" NBA Live ' 96 \" and\nothers coming in second.\n\n\nBoys are keener on the stuff than girls.\n\n\nAnd, despite the apparent savagery of the games, Mom or Dad gives in\nand buys them because the graphics are attractive.\n\n\nBoys also love to shop for themselves but have limited budgets. \n\n \n\nGirls, of course, have tamer tastes.\n\n\nThey go for \" Speed \" , a very fast game consisting\nof letters, and do characters such as \" Barbie \" and\n\" Sailor Man \" , as well as \" Jazz \" ,\n\" Solitaire \" , \" Mine Sweeper \" .\n\n\nBut some girls, especially those who have brothers, cater to their\nmysterious subconscious yen for violence. \n\n\n  Schools  \n\n \n\nAside from unsupervised access to violent video games, Dr. Liwag 's\nconcern is the dearth of educational ones.\n\n\nTrue, there are not enough of them mainly because they are too\nexpensive.\n\n\nPerhaps due to their nature, knock-offs or copies are not popular.\n\n\nAlso, it 's obvious kids enjoy other kinds of games more because\nthose related to education remind them of school which they would rather\nforget for a while. \n\n \n\nBut school plays a significant role because it is there where\npeer pressure is strongest.\n\n\nSan Beda grade school guidance head Hope Herico feels peer pressure,\nthe wish to belong, is one reason computer games have caught on. \n\n \n\n \" When it started a few years back, the study\nhabits of some students were affected, &rdquo;  Herico says.\n\n\n \" Their grades went down.\n\n\nWe found out why through counselling: They 'd stay up late playing.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThey have not had any serious problem since, though Herico\nreveals that about 85 percent to 90 percent of the student body have family\ncomputers or PCs in their residence. \n\n \n\nThose who can't afford these luxuries settle for something else.\n\n\nYoung boys who belong to low-income groups, perhaps also afraid of\nbeing left out, roam video arcades in various malls, seeking thrills their\nwell-heeled counterparts find within the comfort of their homes. \n\n\n  Arcade games  \n\n \n\nBasically, arcade games are the same ones packaged in\ncartridges, CDs and CD-ROMs, but are built into the machine.\n\n\nYou have to buy &peso;5-tokens to be able to play.\n\n\nWith the child 's meager   baon   , how many\ntokens can be bought?\n\n\nYet, the child indulges with unbridled enthusiasm, bent on beating\nthat implacable machine, playing the hours away, cutting classes, squandering\na whole week 's allowance - - all this unknown to parents. \n\n \n\nParents have to know. \n\n \n\n \" I feel they should be aware of what games their\nchildren are playing, &rdquo;  says Liwag.\n\n\n \" They have to investigate.\n\n\nThey can't take a chance. &rdquo; \n\n\nShe paints a fearful extreme scenario of children who are cold,\ninsensitive, socialized by machine and software. \n\n \n\nWhich is why children have to develop a range of activities.\n\n\nNo doubt, computers can be a potent tool for learning.\n\n\n \" But the key to learning is variety, supervision and\nreflection, &rdquo;  says Bernardo.\n\n\n \" To keep skills flexible, children have to explore\nand develop different interests. &rdquo; \n\n\nWith regard to violent computer games, Bernardo is uncompromising.\n\n\n \n\n \" If parents have been allowing children to play\nfor five to eight hours every day, they should worry, &rdquo; \nBernardo says.\n\n\n \" It 's difficult to make them stop, but it can be\nregulated.\n\n\nReduce the time they spend with the machine.\n\n\nSupervise and control, which should also be done with TV and other\nforms of media.\n\n\nPut the game in the context of real life.\n\n\nTell them it 's only a game.\n\n\nProcess it with them. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Make them reflect on the activity.\n\n\nWhy are they enjoying it?\n\n\nHow is it related to their studies?\n\n\nChildren should realize parents are their partners in learning.\n\n\nParents have to be part of it.\n\n\nThey can't decide for the children but they can work with them.\n\n\nIf they don't have the time,   yayas   or\nhousehold helpers should be trained to supervise.\"  \n\n \n\nThe games won't go away nor can they be categorically labeled.\n\n\nBernardo feels they should be rated in terms of educational values:\n \" Parents themselves should inject values because these are not\nself-evident in the games. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThe role of parents cannot be overestimated.\n\n\n \" On a general level, schools should work with them,\n&rdquo;  he says.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6d98b82e-6401-4a5d-8047-bcbcc9aaa17b", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.239629+00:00"}
{"text": "Making rural banks viable in these times of uncertainty\n \n\n\n Bernardo V. Lopez \n\n \n\nQUIETLY but surely, unknown in the big cities, about a third of\nthe rural banks across the entire country are experiencing liquidity problems\nas a result of the \" Asian flu \" .\n\n\nDepressed markets and the ensuing deflation are sending the small and\nmedium enterprises ( SMEs) and the agrarian economy itself tumbling down.\n\n\n \n\nSpecifically, there are dramatic increases in nonperforming\nassets, the other type of \" \" NPA &rdquo; \" which is\nwreaking havoc in the countryside presently.\n\n\nPast-due loans or bad debts are rearing their ugly heads on the credit\nlandscape, the same problems being experienced by the Japanese mega-banks.\n\n\nThe Philippine rural banks are a microcosm of the Japanese mega-banks.\n\n\n\n  Seven deadly virtues  \n\n \n\nHow do we make rural banks bankable during these times of\nrecession?\n\n\nLarry Esguerra, professor of Banking and Finance and Director of\nCredit Programs at the Ateneo Graduate School of Business, which has\nestablished a partnership training institute with the Bankers Association of\nthe Philippines ( BAP), gives us some tips.\n\n\nLarry used to be a CEO of Golden Bay Federal Credit Union in Moffett\nField, California. \n\n \n\nLarry gives seven key pointers.\n\n\nFirst, to be able to achieve and enhance rural bank performances,\nexisting NPAs should be written off.\n\n\nLet the bank start with a clean slate.\n\n\nThe books are clean and the bank has a better financial status\nbecause the burden from these NPAs on bank performance is removed.\n\n\nPrudent accounting procedures dictate the exact way to treat NPAs.\n\n\n \n\nThese NPAs will eventually be written off anyway by the \nBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas  .\n\n\nThere is no choice.\n\n\nDo it now than later under duress.\n\n\nThe ultimate measure of any bank is the \" Return on Assets (\nROA) \" which is simply the ratio of net income over total assets.\n\n\nA bank with a big assets base but little income has a low ROA.\n\n\nROA is thus increased when NPAs are written off. \n\n \n\nSecond, the writing off of NPAs does not mean that these are\nabandoned.\n\n\nThere should still be renewed effort to collect.\n\n\nThis arduous task is better left to specialists, namely collection\nagencies who have the capability to pursue legal means to collect. \n\n \n\nThis does not mean banks should be merciless during these times\nof want.\n\n\nThe premise is borrowers will pay if they can.\n\n\nThey are not renegades who will run away.\n\n\nThey will not pay if they simply have no more money.\n\n\nCollection must be coupled with consideration of the recession.\n\n\nGive them time and maximum tolerance. \n\n \n\nThird is the tenet of banking capability.\n\n\nMost rural banks today have no capability to properly evaluate\nprospective borrowers.\n\n\nThey cannot see good from bad credit.\n\n\nThere is a need to overhaul credit evaluation systems of rural banks\nthrough proper training of management.\n\n\nProperly evaluated credits are half-collected already. \n\n \n\nWell-managed banks go for quality not quantity in increasing loan\nportfolios.\n\n\nAs an example, clients with collateral do not mean they will pay or\nthat the loans are \" safe\".\n\n\nWith or without collateral, clients with good cash flows insure their\ncapability to pay.\n\n\nAnd good collateral coupled with bad cash management is disastrous.\n\n\nSo, credit evaluators have to look at other \" financial\nwindows\", not just collaterals, in evaluating the bankability of borrowers.\n\n\n \n\nFourth, nothing can replace an effective loans monitoring system\nas the way to reduce future NPAs.\n\n\nFor example, a bank should act immediately when signs of nonpayment\nare seen.\n\n\nIf a loan is past-due for a month, a systematic procedure must be in\nplace and implemented right away.\n\n\nEffort must be vigorous and consistent.\n\n\nThe absence of collection effort gives a \" hint &rdquo; to the\nborrower that the bank is not interested in running after the account.\n\n\nIt actually encourages payment default. \n\n \n\nOne cannot wait another month without action, otherwise, one is\ninducing the very nonpayment one is trying to avoid.\n\n\nChances of payment on the third month are slim based on experience.\n\n\nThe procedure to run after an account should include a one-to-one\ntreatment of past-loans. \n\n \n\nThe system should also include the accurate and on-time\npreparation of past-due-accounts reports on a monthly basis which should be\nreviewed by the board.\n\n\nThese reports are critical management information for proper\ndisposition.\n\n\nCritical accounts must be identified right away.\n\n\nA special monitoring system for these critical accounts will enhance\ncollections. \n\n \n\nFifth is the tenet of \" owners as managers\".\n\n\nThe role of the rural bank 's board is critical because it involves\nguidelines and policies.\n\n\nIf the board is insulated from operational problems of the bank, it\nwill be incapable of pursuing policies which will solve critical problems\nsuch as ever increasing NPAs. \n\n \n\nThe board must be involved in monitoring and overseeing all\naspects of bank operations through regular meetings.\n\n\nAbsentee board members is one way to insure unattended NPAs.\n\n\nIf members are \" too busy\", then they deserve what is coming to\nthem. \n\n \n\nSixth is the tenet of integrated management training program.\n\n\nAs articulated above, rural bank managers must undergo proper\ntraining in credit and collection and financial analysis and planning.\n\n\nThere must be a full blown integrated management training program in\nthe medium term as a response to an era of recession and economic decline\nwhich naturally threatens smaller banks. \n\n \n\nSeventh and last, the training of government must be complemented\nby the hiring of key consultants who are experts in credit evaluation, loans\nmonitoring, financial analysis and strategizing, etc.\n\n\nThey include the fast track hands-on training of managers.\n\n\nThe training of management can come from these consultants not only\nthrough seminars but also on actual hands-on in the implementation of the\nconsultants ' recommendations and of evolved strategies. \n\n\n  National economy and the rural banks  \n\n \n\nMany rural banks need to be rescued but there is no government or\nprivate sector entity to address this because this is a new problem.\n\n\nLiquidity problems of rural banks on a massive scale is being\nexperienced for the first time.\n\n\nThe  Bangko Sentral  can institute policy reforms to\naddress this.\n\n\nLand Bank and DBP may have crucial roles. \n\n \n\nPrivate sector interventions are also possible through existing\nrural bank associations where CEOs and board members know each other.\n\n\nMergers can be facilitated through these associations.\n\n\nThey can also address common solutions to common problems and share\nhuman resources.\n\n\nAlliances with bigger commercial banks are also possible if we can\nsomehow bridge the gap between the big cities and the countryside. \n\n \n\nIf rural banks fail, we will see the rise of a more vicious and\nexpanded loan shark system. \n\n \n\nIndeed, even the loan sharks are experiencing collection\nproblems.\n\n\nBut the loan sharks as a banking system, illicit as they are, are\nmuch larger by far than all the rural banks combined. \n\n \n\nThis strange phenomenon is a product of a protracted credit\ncrisis in the countryside and the medieval  encomienda \nsystem persisting in the tenancy and sharing schemes of our present agrarian\neconomy.\n\n\nAnd as a result, our agrarian economy has been consistently\nmarginalized.\n\n\nUsury, or the \" 4-5-6 system \" , persists in all\ncrops--rice, corn, coconut, vegetables, fish. \n\n \n\nYou name it, there is someone on the side lending at usurious\nrates because the rural banking system is weak and fears lending to peasants.\n\n\nAnd to think that our economy is about 70 percent agrarian and 70\npercent of our population survive from it. \n\n \n\nThe situation is not hopeless for rural banks.\n\n\nThere is ample room for financial maneuverability.\n\n\nThe initiatives must come from both victims and rescuers, whether\ngovernment or private sector, to come put with creative solutions as a\nresponse to recession. \n\n \n\nRural banks have a key socio-economic role of service to both the\nSMEs and the entire agrarian sector.\n\n\nTheir success translates into better food security for the entire\nnation, less imported basic commodities, less usury for the poor and less\ninstability and tendency towards insurgency.\n\n\nIndeed, their role is just as crucial as commercial banks in the big\ncities.\n\n\nThis is why it is critical for our rural banks to make it through\nthis present crisis.  \n\n\n\n\n  What do depreciation rates tell us?  \n\n\n Johnny Noe Raval \n\n \n\nA FEW days ago, we were casually discussing wedding arrangements\nand the impending career shift of one of our friends when the topic abruptly\nchanged.\n\n\nAfter some jostling, someone finally asked me how depreciation rates\nshould be calculated.\n\n\nThe question seemed strange, specially coming from someone who deals\nwith these numbers almost daily.\n\n\nMy first thought was this must be a trick question but I just could\nnot think of anything funny about foreign exchange rates for the past year.\n\n\nSince the question did come with a half-startled look, I figured that\na point was to be expected in the next minute or so. \n\n \n\nTrue enough, there was good reason to be startled.\n\n\nWith the peso revaluing against the dollar from &peso;26.40-&dollar;1\nin early July 1997 to the current level of roughly &peso;42.00-&dollar;1,\njust exactly how much has the depreciation rate been thus far?\n\n\nThe immediate reaction of everyone around the table was to subtract\n&peso;26.40 from &peso;42.00 and divide by &peso;26.40.\n\n\nThis would turn out to be slightly above 59 percent. \n\n \n\nIf we apply this simple method to the currencies in the region,\nwe would find from table 1 that the Indonesian  rupiah \nhas depreciated the most followed by the Thai  baht  and\nthe Malaysian  ringgit  . \n\n \n\nBased on this calculation, most analysts relate the magnitude of\nthe depreciation to the comparative weakness of the respective economies.\n\n\nThis is also partly why almost everyone comments that the\nPhilippines--a small and fragile economy--has weathered the currency crisis\ncomparatively well. \n\n \n\nNow here 's the point.\n\n\nIn the April 18, 1998 issue of \" The Economist \" ,\nthe point was raised that it is not possible to lose more than 100 percent of\nthe value of the currency.\n\n\nAny tradeable asset or commodity has a price and it is this price\nwhich reflects its market value.\n\n\nTo suggest that such an asset can lose more than 100 percent of its\nvalue is to imply that there are commodities with negative prices.\n\n\nThis is not the same as the distinction made by economists between a\n\" good &rdquo; and a \" bad &rdquo; since we are strictly limiting\nthings to \" goods\". \n\n \n\nThe fact is that there is no \" good &rdquo; in the market\nwith a negative price.\n\n\nWe are also not talking about the possible complications with\n\" short selling\".\n\n\nWhile I agree that short selling can be a disastrous activity if you\nincorrectly anticipate, what \" The Economist \" is saying is\nthat the price itself of the commodity cannot turn negative even though\nlosses may be incurred in the course of using the commodity. \n\n \n\nSince the point is a truism of sorts, then it can only mean that\nour conventional calculation of the depreciation rate is incorrect.\n\n\nIf the  rupiah  has not fallen by 495 percent and\nthe  baht  has not weakened by 66 percent, then the peso\nhas also not depreciated by 59 percent against the US dollar.\n\n\nIf these figures are all incorrect anyway, is it possible that the\nPhilippines may actually have fared worse than what we have been thinking all\nalong?\n\n\nAnd if calculating depreciation rates can be confusing, is there\ninformational value in hearing these figures publicly? \n\n \n\nThe first order of business is to find out just exactly how much\nthe regional currencies have depreciated against the US dollar.\n\n\nFrom the exchange rates listed in table 2, the correct depreciation\nrates come out as 83 percent for the  rupiah  , 35 percent\nfor the  won  , 39 percent for the  ringgit\n , 40 percent for the  baht  and 37 percent for\nthe peso.\n\n\nAm I certain of these calculations?\n\n\nThe answer is simply \" YES\". \n\n \n\nThe source of the confusion in the calculation of depreciation\nrates is practical as it is philosophical.\n\n\nThe practical side of this arises in the way exchange rates are\nquoted.\n\n\nSince an exchange rate is bilateral between a local economy and its\nforeign partner a necessary distinction is made between the  commodity\ncurrency  and the  terms currency  . \n\n \n\nThe former is the currency to be priced while the latter is the\ncurrency which will serve as the price scale in the valuation.\n\n\nWhen we say that the peso-dollar rate is &peso;42.00-&dollar;1 in\nthis form the dollar is the commodity currency and it is the peso which is\nthe terms currency. \n\n \n\nThe problem is that from a Philippine standpoint, the peso 's\nvalue in dollar terms is really &dollar;0.02381-&peso;1, not the\n&dollar;1-&peso;42.00 rate we often hear.\n\n\nBoth ratios are actually numerically equivalent.\n\n\nBut it is rather \" awkward &rdquo; to say that the peso 's\nvalue is &peso;42.00-&dollar;1 because in this sense it is the dollar which\nis being priced in peso terms.\n\n\nUnfortunately, while it is \" more proper &rdquo; to quote the\npeso 's worth as &dollar;0.02381-&peso;1, it is not in common use perhaps\nbecause most of us find the decimals much too \" cumbersome &rdquo; to\nhandle.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "93f9c64e-bf8a-4681-80da-2355d1a8fbcb", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.241260+00:00"}
{"text": "RP 's blueprint for APEC: A road map to prosperity \n\n\n\n Walden Bello \n\n\n  ( Talk at Preparatory NGO Summit on APEC, July 4, 1996,\nAteneo de Manila University.)  \n\n \n\nThe Philippine Government 's blueprint for its role in APEC is\nfinally out, and the only one looking good is the Asia Foundation. \n\n \n\nThe Asia Foundation funded the research and writing that went into\n\"  APEC and Philippines: Catching the Next Wave  \"\nto the tune of &peso;350,000.\n\n\nThe Foundation undoubtedly meant well, but why is a foreign funding\nagency underwriting the production of the Philippine government 's basic\nstrategy towards APEC?\n\n\nThis is a question that is bugging even some participants in the\npolicy-making process. \n\n \n\nThe reason does not have to do with the Asia Foundation seeking to\ninfluence Philippine policy, says one of those intimately involved in the\nenterprise, who refuses to be identified.\n\n\n \" The government should have paid for the research,\n&rdquo;  he says.\n\n\n \" But its priorities are wrong, government money is\ngoing to the   palabas   and to the security of the\nAPEC bigwigs rather than to substantive stuff. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nLaunched at a Department of Foreign Affairs event featuring\nPresident Fidel Ramos two weeks ago, the report was about five months late -\n- to the frustration of many people involved in the APEC process.\n\n\nEven more frustrating to them, the report is said to omit or distort\nmany views expressed during the National Preparatory Summit for APEC held on\nDecember 10, 1995 the resolution of which were supposed to be the basis of\nthe policy paper. \n\n \n\nBut was the policy paper worth waiting for? \n\n\n  POSITIVE POINTS  \n\n \n\nThe answer is that the paper does have its positive points.\n\n\nPerhaps the most solid essay is the one on \" \" APEC and\nSustainable Development, &rdquo; \" which might be described as one\nlong word of caution about the threat to the environment posed by the sort of\nblanket trade liberalization that is the core of APEC.\n\n\n \" With wrong incentives and absent the proper\nsafeguards,\"  it warns,  \" a liberal trade and\ninvestment regime is equally likely to exert pressure to exploit or deplete\nresources more rapidly than otherwise. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nUnfortunately, the sustainable development chapter is a minority\nvoice in a book that otherwise celebrates the trade and investment\nliberalization that APEC represents. \n\n \n\nBut where is agriculture?\n\n\nBefore the rest of the APEC blueprint is analyzed, it must be noted\nthat there is something very important missing, and that is the government 's\npolicy on APEC and agriculture. \n\n \n\nThis is, of course, a serious omission since agricultural\nliberalization has been one of the main bones of contention in APEC.\n\n\nLast year, the Osaka Summit nearly foundered on the insistence by\nJapan, China, South Korea, and Taiwan - - with the informal backing of\nIndonesia and Malaysia - - that agriculture be excluded from the APEC\nliberalization agenda.\n\n\nDoes the Philippine government back its neighbors?\n\n\nOr does it back the US position that APEC is a  \"\nGATT-plus arrangement &rdquo;  - - that is, one that will initiate a\nfaster and more thorough-going liberalization of agriculture than what APEC\ncountries have committed themselves to under the General Tariffs and Trade (\nGATT)? \n\n \n\nIt might be noted that the US is fairly transparent about the\nreasons for its insistence that agricultural liberalization be central to the\nAPEC agenda: the United States Department of Agriculture estimates that\ntwo-thirds of the global increase anticipated for farm export to the year\n2000 will take place in the Asia-Pacific region, and it wants to make sure\nthat by that time this market, including the Philippines, will absorb some\n60% of US agricultural exports, up from the already large 40% it accounts for\ncurrently. \n\n\n  TECHNOLOGY  \n\n \n\nThe section on Information Technology is great on data but simply\nmisleading in its conclusions and downright irresponsible in its key\nrecommendation to strictly enforce intellectual property rights.\n\n\nTo say that strict adherence to and enforcement of \"\nIntellectual Property Rights &rdquo; will result in the more rapid adoption\nof information technology ( IT) and in a more competitive IT industry in the\nPhilippines is simply false. \n\n \n\nStrict IPR enforcement will raise the price of software and\ncomputer hardware, much of which is now affordable in the current looser IPR\nenforcement regime.\n\n\nFor one thing, tight enforcement will radically raise the costs of\nthe government 's data and information operations since, as pointed out by,\namong others, the United States Trade Representative 's Office report on\ntrade and intellectual property for 1996, the Philippine government is\ncurrently one of the country 's biggest users of unlicensed software. \n\n \n\nStrict IPR enforcement will also act to dampen local innovation\nowing to the royalty payments that innovators will have to pay US and\nJapanese information giants like Microsoft or IBM for patented technologies\nthat are the building blocks of advances in software and hardware.\n\n\nThis is not speculation: Korean firms like Samsung and Hyundai have\nhad their efforts to innovate in integrated circuits blocked by the US firms\nTexas Instruments and Intel 's charges of intellectual piracy and demands for\nexcessive royalties. \n\n \n\nIPR enforcement is a US agenda, not a Philippine one, and perhaps\none reason it has been smuggled into the Philippine government position is\nthat Bill Gates 's viceroy to the country, Michael Hard, general manager of\nMicrosoft Philippines, made an aggressive input into the document.\n\n\nAnother reason is also unstated: the Philippines is coming up for\nreview by the United States Trade Representative 's Office in October and the\ngovernment desperately wants to leave Washington 's \" watch list\n&rdquo; of IPR violators before the APEC Summit. \n\n \n\nThe authors of the volume should just have been more honest and\nstated baldly that the reason the government wants tighter IPR enforcement is\nthat it faces US trade sanctions otherwise, instead of trying to prove the\nimpossible: that the higher IT cost this would entail would boost to the\nspread of IT in the country. \n\n\n  SMALL BUSINESS  \n\n \n\nChampioning SMEs ( small and medium enterprises) is a popular\nstance in ASEAN ( Association of Southeast Asian Nations).\n\n\nThe report adopts this posture, but it does a great disservice to the\nSME sector by prescribing a cure that is likely to worsen its current status.\n\n\nOpening up to the winds of international competition via trade and\ninvestment liberalization, it says, will work to the benefit of the SMEs.\n\n\nThis is hard to believe, since by the paper 's own description,\n \" Except for a few SMEs at the international best practice\nfrontier, the overwhelming majority are characterized by low levels of\nproductivity, stemming primarily from the inadequate supply of complementary\ninputs of capital and skilled human resources. &rdquo; \n\n\nMoreover, entrepreneurial and managerial skills are in short supply,\n \" causing high death rates among SMEs. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nFrom the experience of other economies, the key to survival of\nSMEs is strong state support in the form of judicious protection against\nunfair foreign competition and anti-monopoly action against unfair trading\npractices by large local firms.\n\n\nBut this is precisely the sort of effective \" state\nintervention &rdquo; that the proponents of trade and investment\nliberalization in APEC would like to outlaw.\n\n\nThe report 's recommendations - - providing SMEs training in\nbusiness, access to information technology, access to information about\nmarkets, and access to credit - - are tantamount to equipping them with\nsling-shots in the rough and tumble world of liberalized regional trade and\ninvestment dominated by aggressive American, Japanese, and NIC conglomerates.\n\n\n\n  INVESTMENT EASE  \n\n \n\nThe key recommendation of the paper on investment is despite the\nliberalization of the foreign investment code over the last ten years, it\nstill is not liberal enough to attract foreign investors.\n\n\nThus, the Philippine retail trade sector must be opened up to foreign\ninvestors, and negative lists, or lists of industries in which foreign\ninvestors are banned or restricted, must be scrapped.\n\n\nAnd further measures must be taken to enhance the security of \"\nforeign land tenure. &rdquo;\n\n\nThe idea is to become the most user friendly foreign investment code\nin the Asia-Pacific, to come up with a code that would basically give foreign\ninvestors \" national treatment, &rdquo; or providing them with equal\nrights as domestic investors. \n\n \n\nForeign investments has a key role in national development.\n\n\nThe problem with the Philippines ' approach is that it simply is not\ntrue that the best way to attract and manage foreign investors is by giving\nthem royal treatment.\n\n\nIndeed, a comparative look at our Asian neighbors shows that despite\nthe fact that they have had more restrictive foreign investment codes than\nthe Philippines over the last decade, they have nevertheless attracted far\ngreater amounts of investment than that country.\n\n\nAn examination of Japanese investment patterns, for instance, reveals\nthat between 1988 and 1993, &dollar;6.0 billion went to Indonesia,\n&dollar;5.3 billion into Thailand, &dollar;4.2 billion into Malaysia, and\n&dollar;2.2 billion into Taiwan.\n\n\nEven South Korea, which US government sources regularly denounce as\nhaving one of the world 's most restrictive investment codes, if not the most\nilliberal one got &dollar;2.1 billion, compared to the Philippines\n&dollar;1.1 billion over the same period. \n\n \n\nThe reason foreign investors favor an economy does not lie in the\nrelative looseness of its foreign investment code relative to others but\nelsewhere.\n\n\nThe report tries to prove its case by citing the complaints of\nforeign investors, but foreign investors will always find cause to complain,\neven if you have already given them the store - - lock, stock, and barrel.\n\n\n\n  TRADE LIB  \n\n \n\nThe core of the blueprint is the section of trade liberalization,\nand here the government 's stance is that whether or not our neighbors move\ntoward trade liberalization, the Philippines must continue inexorably on the\npath of the trade reforms, to complete its program of unilateral\nliberalization that will bring about a uniform tariff for all goods of five\nper cent by 2004.\n\n\nTo use the words of Dr. Jesus Estanislao, the Filipino representative\nto the ( now disbanded) Eminent Persons Group, the Philippines must \n\" bear the burden of APEC leadership by example. &rdquo; \n\n\nOr as President Ramos puts it,  \" We must blaze the\ntrail that others must follow. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nBrave words but pure bravado.\n\n\nIf the Philippines ' neighbors like Japan, Korea, Malaysia,\nIndonesia, and China have been, in contrast to our government, so resistant\nto the American prescription of blanket liberalization, there is a reason for\nthis, and the reason is that state intervention in the area of trade - -\nwhich included both judicious protectionism when it came to the domestic\nmarket and mercantilism ( aggressively subsidizing their exporters) when it\ncame to international markets - - has been a central reason for their\nsuccess.\n\n\nIt is this factor - - the creative role of state intervention in\ntrade to correct the imperfections of the international market and give one 's\nexporters a leg up in international competition - - that the introduction to\nthe blueprint deliberately overlooks when it ascribes the East Asian\nindustrialization experience solely to two sources: markets and technology.\n\n\n \n\nThese comments should not mislead leaders into thinking we are\nagainst liberalization.\n\n\nIndeed, one can argue that the Philippine economy needs a good dose\nof it.\n\n\nBut liberalization should be a  tactic  of a pragmatic trade\npolicy rather than an uncritical  strategy  dictated by doctrinal\nbelief.\n\n\nWhat is especially dangerous about free trade agreements like APEC\nand the GATT-WTO is that they lock in place or make irreversible - - under\npain of trade sanctions - - national liberalization programs.\n\n\nThey virtually eliminate trade policy as a pragmatic tool of national\ngovernment. \n\n \n\nVisionaries are said to be either geniuses or madmen, and given\nthe realities of international economic  real-politik  and\nthe indispensability of interventionist trade policy management in the\nexperience of late industrializers like its neighbors, the RP vision of\n\" leading by example, &rdquo; of \" going it alone &rdquo; even if\nits Asian neighbors do not dance to Washington 's siren song of\nliberalization is unlikely to be a stroke of genius. \n\n \n\nAs one observer once remarked, the difference between Filipino\neconomists and technocrats and their Asian counterparts is that the Filipinos\nimbibe Chicago School free trade theory as academics and try to implement it\nwhen they get into government, whereas other Asian economists might praise\nfree trade when in the company of the Americans and Australians but, in\npractice, they protect their economies like hell. \n\n \n\nThere is, however, one important APEC actor that will applaud the\nsentiments and policy proposals of \" \" APEC: Catching the Next\nWave, &rdquo; \" and that is Washington.\n\n\nFor the proposals fall right into its game plan of having the Ramos\ngovernment, as host of the 1996 Summit, put back on track the US free trade\nagenda that was derailed by the Asian countries during the Osaka APEC Summit\nlast year.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f77c4f54-9243-4758-ab0b-89f01548f776", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.242502+00:00"}
{"text": "Sad about RP democracy, but proud to be Filipino \n\n\n\n By Jose V. Abueva \n\n \n\n ( Editor 's note: The author is professor  emeritus\n of the University of the Philippines ' Political Science and\nPublic Administration, president of  Kalayaan  College and\nfellow and trustee of Social Weather Stations.)  \n\n \n\nWHILE more Filipinos are dissatisfied with the way democracy works\nin the country and are not proud of our political system, the great majority\nof them are quite proud to be Filipino. \n\n \n\nThis was the most outstanding finding of a recent University of\nthe Philippines survey conducted nationwide.\n\n\nIt 's an important fact to know and appreciate as we celebrate the\n104th anniversary of our declaration of independence from Spain on June 12,\n1898, and the 56th anniversary of regaining our independence from the United\nStates on July 4, 1946. \n\n \n\nAnother significant finding of the survey is that Filipinos\nconsider being God-centered, industrious and faithful to service, work or\ncountry as most important traits they identify most with \" being a good\nFilipino citizen. &rdquo; \n\n \n\n\" The INQUIRER \" had earlier published other\nfindings of the UP national survey conducted by the author for the Center for\nLeadership, Citizenship, and Democracy of the state university 's National\nCollege of Public Administration and Governance. \n\n \n\nThe survey taken in November 2001 involved interviews of a\nrepresentative sample of 1,200 respondents who are 18 years and older, with a\nmargin of error of plus or minus 3 percent. \n\n \n\nIt asked respondents,  \" How proud are you to be a\nFilipino citizen? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nMuch pride was evident in the responses nationwide: 57 percent\nfor \" Very Proud \" ; 34 percent for \" Proud\n\" ; and only 9 percent for \" Not Proud \" , and one\npercent for \" Not at All Proud \" . \n\n \n\nOne can derive a summary measure for national pride by adding the\nfirst two positive responses ( \" Very Proud \" plus \"\nProud \" ) , then subtracting the sum of the negative responses (\n\" Not Proud \" plus \" Not at All Proud \" ) .\n\n\nThis would yield a \" margin of pride &rdquo; or \" a score\nfor net pride. &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThe margins for national pride were rather high: 82 percent in\nthe entire Philippines and even 91 among Metro Manila respondents. \n\n \n\nThe relatively greater national pride of Metro Manilans, who are\nusually better informed and more critical than the nation as a whole, made\nthe finding more remarkable. \n\n \n\nIn general, national pride was lower though still high in the\nrural areas ( 79 percent) than in the urban ( 86 percent).\n\n\nNet pride in rural Visayas was 74 percent; in urban Mindanao, 71\npercent; and in rural Mindanao, 74 percent. \n\n \n\nThe net pride scores did not differ substantially across income\nclasses or genders.\n\n\nNotably, in the age groups, pride was greatest in the two youngest\nsets: plus 93 for those aged 18-24 years, and plus 87 for those aged 25-34\nyears. \n\n \n\nThis is a very hopeful sign, for despite the many problems\nFilipinos suffer from and adults complain of, our youths keep high their\nfaith in their nationhood and citizenship. \n\n \n\nContrast this with a study of schoolchildren in Metro Manila\nduring the later years of the Marcos dictatorship, in which most of them said\nthat they would rather be foreigners than Filipinos. \n\n \n\nHowever, this was reversed following the Edsa Revolution in 1986.\n\n\n\n  Most valued traits  \n\n \n\nThe survey investigated the importance of certain characteristics\nthat \" good citizens &rdquo; possess as respondents were presented a\nlist of traits. \n\n \n\nThey were asked to rate each one as \" \" Very\nImportant, &rdquo; \" \" \" Somewhat Important &rdquo;\n\" or \" \" Not Important. &rdquo; \"\n\n\nThe summary indicator would be the margin of importance: percentage\nof \" Very Important \" minus percentage of \" Not\nImportant \" . \n\n \n\nThe \" Very Important \" responses were dominant\nacross all characteristics, so the margins were positive and large.\n\n\nWe are providing a ranking of these traits by their net importance.\n\n\n \n\nTopping the most important qualities were being God-centered;\nindustrious; faithful to service, work or country; having convictions; and\nbeing responsible. \n\n \n\nThe following were the margins of importance: God-centered, 91\npercent; industrious, 91 percent; faithful to service, work, or country, 88\npercent; has convictions, 86 percent; responsible, 86 percent; peaceful and\nlaw-abiding, 85 percent; loving and caring, 84 percent; concerned with the\ncommon good, 83 percent; wants to learn, 83 percent; nationalistic, 81\npercent; sociable, 80 percent; free, 80 percent; civic spirited, 76 percent;\nassertive, 76 percent; willing to unite with others for a common purpose, 73\npercent; thrifty, 72 percent; democratic, 70 percent; competitive, 57\npercent; and courageous, 57 percent. \n\n\n  National identity  \n\n \n\nTo draw out more perceptions on national identity, the survey\nasked the people to agree or disagree with certain test statements. \n\n \n\nFor each item, they were presented a 5-point scale.\n\n\nThey were asked,  \" Would you say that you ( \"\nStrongly Agree \" ) , ( \" Agree \" ) , ( \"\nMaybe Agree or Maybe Disagree \" ) , ( \" Disagree \" )\nor ( \" Strongly Disagree \" ) with the statement... ? &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\nThe summary measure here would be the margin of agreement - - the\npercentage agreeing with the statement minus the percentage disagreeing.\n\n\nThe category \" \" Maybe Agree/ Maybe Disagree &rdquo;\n\" was the neutral midpoint in the range and would not figure in\ncalculating the margin. \n\n \n\nThere was strong net agreement, at 81 percent, for the test\nstatement,  \" I would rather be a citizen of the Philippines\nthan of any other country in the world. &rdquo; \n\n\nThis is consistent with the respondents ' expression of much pride in\nbeing Filipino. \n\n \n\nDisagreement was dominant for the statement,  \"\nPeople should support their country even if their country is in the wrong.\n&rdquo; \n\n\nThe margin of agreement was at negative 27 percent.\n\n\nThat is, more Filipinos do not subscribe to the value of \n\" my country, right or wrong. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThere was strong support for doing much better in English\ninstruction.\n\n\nThe statement,  \" Philippine schools should make much\neffort to teach English properly &rdquo;  yielded a net agreement\nscore of 79 percent. \n\n \n\nThis is in recognition of the deterioration in many people 's\nability to speak and write in English, which is a handicap in cross-cultural\nlearning and communication. \n\n \n\nAnother item was  \" Philippine television stations\nshould give preference to Filipino films and programs over those that are\nforeign. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nAgreement was less pronounced, at 45 percent.\n\n\nBut still this reflects the concern that Filipino cultures are being\nundermined by foreign, mostly American, domination of the mass media. \n\n\n  Being Filipino  \n\n \n\nWhat does it really mean to be \" truly Filipino\"?\n\n\nField interviewers read aloud the following introduction before\nasking their opinion: \n\n \n\n \" Some people say that the following things are\nimportant for being truly Filipino.\n\n\nOthers say they are not important.\n\n\nHow important or unimportant do you think each of the following is?\n\n\nWould you say that it is: \" Very Important \" ,\n\" Fairly Important \" , \" Not Very Important\n\" , or \" Not At All Important \" ? &rdquo; \n\n\n \n\nThe summary margin was the sum of the percentages for \"\nVery Important \" and \" Fairly Important \" , minus\nthe sum of the percentages for \" Not Very Important \" and\n\" Not at All Important \" . \n\n \n\nAs rearranged from highest to less high, the listed\nqualifications show the following margins of importance:\n\n\n- \" To feel Filipino, &rdquo; 85 percent.\n\n\n- \" To respect Philippine political institutions and laws,\n&rdquo; 83 percent.\n\n\n- \" To have Filipino citizenship, &rdquo; 76 percent.\n\n\n- \" To be able to speak Filipino, the national language,\n&rdquo; 74 percent.\n\n\n- \" To have lived in the Philippines for most of one 's life,\n&rdquo; 70 percent.\n\n\n- \" To be a Christian, &rdquo; 68 percent. \n\n \n\nHence, people believed that the sense of \" feeling Filipino\n&rdquo; was the strongest qualification to be \" truly Filipino. &rdquo;\n\n\n \n\nNevertheless, they believed that respecting the nation 's\ninstitutions and laws was vital for maintaining one 's Filipino identity.\n\n\n \n\nFilipino citizenship and ability to speak the national language\nwere also deemed quite important. \n\n \n\nResidence abroad and being Christian counted a bit less to be\n\" truly Filipino. &rdquo; \n\n \n\nTo most respondents, to be \" truly Filipino &rdquo; is\ninclusive of Filipinos who live long abroad and of those who believe in other\nreligions. \n\n\n  Meaning of Nationalism  \n\n \n\nThe survey proceeded to explore the meaning of \" \"\nnationalism. &rdquo; \"\n\n\nInterviewers presented a menu of nine meanings for defining\nnationalism.\n\n\nRespondents could choose as many as five meanings to reflect or\nexplain their understanding of nationalism.\n\n\nHere is the ranking of definitions, by percentage:\n\n\n- Loyalty to and service to the country, 72 percent.\n\n\n- Being proud of our own history, culture and customs, languages,\nliterature, music, art, and products, 72 percent.\n\n\n- Promoting freedom, justice and democracy here in the Philippines,\n63 percent.\n\n\n- Promoting the common good and the welfare of all the people, 62\npercent.\n\n\n- Patriotism and love of country, 58 percent.\n\n\n- Asserting our independence, 50 percent.\n\n\n- Promoting nationhood, national identity, and national unity, 48\npercent.\n\n\n- Opposing foreign domination of our country, 30 percent.\n\n\n- Promoting the nation 's goals and national interest, 30 percent.\n\n\n\n  Filipino heroes  \n\n \n\nThe survey looked into heroism by asking an open-ended question:\n \" Who do you think are the Philippine heroes from the past\nuntil the present? &rdquo; \n\n\nThen the follow-up question:  \" Who else? &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\nBy far the top-of-the-mind hero from history named was Jose\nRizal, cited by 75 percent of the respondents. \n\n \n\nAndres Bonifacio was a far second, at 7 percent.\n\n\nOther heroes from history cited were Apolinario Mabini ( one\npercent), Manuel Quezon ( one percent), and Emilio Aguinaldo ( one percent).\n\n\n \n\nThe top-of-the-mind heroes cited from more recent years were\nNinoy Aquino ( 3 percent), Ferdinand Marcos ( 2 percent), Ramon Magsaysay (\none percent), Diosdado Macapagal ( one percent), Corazon Aquino ( 0.3\npercent), and Joseph Estrada ( 0.26 percent). \n\n \n\nBut an interesting top-of-the-mind answer was \" \"\nOFWs &rdquo; \" or overseas Filipino workers, which got 0.55 percent.\n\n\n \n\nAlso mentioned as heroes were farmers, parents, teachers, and\nthose who were at the Edsa Revolution. \n\n \n\nWhen asked  \" Who else? &rdquo;  after the\ntop-of-the-mind question, some respondents gave their answers.\n\n\nHere are the 12 most prominent names mentioned: Andres Bonifacio, 44\npercent; Apolinario Mabini, 19 percent; Emilio Aguinaldo, 14 percent; Jose\nRizal, 12 percent; Ninoy Aquino, 8 percent; Gregorio del Pilar, 6 percent;\nRamon Magsaysay, 5 percent; Melchora Aquino, 4 percent; Lapu-Lapu, 4 percent;\nMarcelo del Pilar, 4 percent; Juan Luna, 4 percent; and Manuel Quezon, 3\npercent. \n\n \n\nCould it be that most Filipinos think one has to be dead to be\nregarded among the nation 's heroes?\n\n\nCould it be that respondents recall more readily as a hero in recent\ntimes a public figure who had been long in the public limelight? \n\n \n\nSome might reason that some Filipinos have a short memory, and a\npoor sense of history, or even of right and wrong. \n\n \n\nSignificantly, 24 percent of the respondents did not cite any\nhero at all.\n\n\nYet some respondents mentioned certain groups of citizens as \"\nheroes. &rdquo; \n\n\n  National Anthem  \n\n \n\nA basic citizen ritual to show love of, and respect for, one 's\ncountry is the singing of the national anthem.\n\n\nHow many Filipinos 18 years and above really take the \n\" Pambansang Awit &rdquo;  to heart?

{"text": "The ludicrousness of our electoral laws  \n\n\n By MANUEL F. ALMARIO \n\n \n\n There  are good laws and bad laws.\n\n\nGood laws are those that promote justice, foster progress and enhance\nliberty.\n\n\nBad laws are those that are oppressive, unjust and which curtail human\nrights. \n\n \n\nA bad law is also one that is unenforceable because it is\nimpractical, even ridiculous, and not fully sanctioned by public opinion.\n\n\nIn such a case, a bad law is more honored in the breach than in the\nobservance. \n\n \n\nAmong the bad laws in Philippine experience was the one during\nmartial law which penalized by fine or imprisonment failure to vote in\nelections.\n\n\nThis was never enforced, at least not seriously, because during\nelections thousands, perhaps millions, of Filipinos don't vote.\n\n\nOur jails would not be enough to hold all those who fail to vote\neither intentionally or for lack of interest.\n\n\nBesides, the refusal to vote is as much a right as the act of voting.\n\n\n \n\nIn the 1981 presidential elections, which was boycotted by many\nvoters, the Marcos regime tried to make an example of several individuals by\nfiling charges against them for violation of the election law penalizing\nnon-voting.\n\n\nAs far as we recall, these suits were not pursued to their final\nconclusion. \n\n \n\nAnother bad edict was Marcos 's order for a curfew on the last\nday of the EDSA revolution when he had no more power.\n\n\nThe people laughed themselves to near death in the streets and at the\nbarricades. \n\n \n\nIn the United States, one notoriously bad law was the \"\nProhibition Law \" which prohibited the sale and drinking of\nalcoholic beverages.\n\n\nThe law, passed by the U.S. Congress under pressure of religious and\nmoralistic groups, was rejected by the public in general so that it readily\nspawned a huge underground business in smuggling and gangsterism.\n\n\nThe law later on had to be repealed. \n\n \n\nSo mere good intentions do not necessarily make good law.\n\n\nAs the saying goes,  the road to hell is paved with good\nintentions.  \n\n \n\n Sadly  , we have in our statute books an election\ncode which is full of silly regulations that cannot be enforced simply\nbecause they are impractical or not fully supported by public opinion. \n\n \n\nOne such regulation is that which limit campaigning to 90 days\nfor national candidates and to 45 days for local candidates.\n\n\nOstensibly, the purpose of such regulation is to limit the expenses\nof candidates, thus placing them, both rich and poor alike, on an equal\nbasis. \n\n \n\nBut of course this is not really followed.\n\n\nPoliticians campaign all the time, whether there is a formal campaign\nperiod or not. \n\n \n\nPoliticians who are successfully elected to public office\ncampaign for their reelection immediately after taking their oath of office.\n\n\nThe defeated candidates, on the other hand, start making plans and\ntaking moves for the next election right after the results of the last\nelection are known. \n\n \n\nSome people may say this makes for too much politics.\n\n\nBut politics is the lifeblood of democracy, and the lifeblood must\nkeep on running otherwise the body politic, which is the state, would die.\n\n\nBesides the ban against \" campaigning &rdquo; outside of a\nformal electoral period is, in essence, a curtailment of the freedom of\nspeech and the freedom of assembly.\n\n\nSince it limits the exercise of liberty, it is a bad law. \n\n \n\nBecause politics is the art or science of government, and\ngovernment is a continuing affair, then necessarily politics is a constant\nactivity, especially because governmental power must permanently be\nconfronted by a militant opposition to prevent its abuse.\n\n\nIt is when an opposition becomes lax or cowardly that abuse of power\nin a democracy becomes possible, as in the time when President Marcos\ndeclared martial law, and the political opposition, with few exceptions,\nfailed to courageously and vigorously oppose it. \n\n \n\n Then  there is the provision prohibiting the\npasting or display of political posters during an election period except in\nplaces designated by the Commission on Elections.\n\n\nNow this is indeed laughable.\n\n\nIt is so ridiculous that most, if not all candidates, violate it, and\nthe public do not mind. \n\n \n\nWhy should the public mind, when what they are interested in is\nknowing first of all who are running and on what issues so that they could\nmake their choice wisely?\n\n\nYou don't expect a citizen to skip work or school, or to sacrifice\nhis leisure, just to make a beeline to some obscure site designated by the\nComelec just to gaze at the faces of the candidates and peruse their inane\npropaganda.\n\n\nHow much more convenient it would be for them just to look through\nthe window of their public conveyances or glance at their neighborhood 's\nfences just to know who is running for office and why. \n\n \n\nAnd then of course there is the ban against political\nadvertisements.\n\n\nTo the  cognoscente  , there are so many ways\ngetting around this rule.\n\n\nIt is the novice who is adversely affected.\n\n\nThe incumbent official who knows his media relations can get\nyear-round publicity without ever spending from his own pocket.\n\n\nBut the new politician, who may have some good and better ideas of\nhow to run a government more effectively, is hide-bound to get his ideas\nacross. \n\n \n\nAll these restrictions on election activities, which are in\nreality restrictions on freedom of information, have been imposed under the\nguise of making elections more equal and less costly.\n\n\nBut as we have observed, the restrictions only benefit the incumbent\nand the already established politicians, and penalize the emerging and\nperhaps more idealistic  politicos  .\n\n\nAs for their curtailing electoral costs, there is already a provision\nlimiting electoral expenses to not more than the salary for one year of the\noffice which the candidate seeks to fill. \n\n \n\nIt is significant that so far not one candidate has been found\nguilty of overspending under the present electoral code.\n\n\nOn the other hand, just before the 1969 elections, a number of\nsenators were found guilty of overspending at a time when the laws were less\nrestrictive.\n\n\nThen there was no limitation of the campaign period, nor no\nrestrictions in the display of posters and streamers. \n\n \n\n The  framers of the present Omnibus Election Code\nmay have been motivated by good intentions.\n\n\nIn truth, they are only implementing the present Constitution, framed\nby a coterie of unelected commissioners, which requires the Comelec to\n \" recommend to Congress effective measures to minimize election\nexpenses, including limitation of places where propaganda materials shall be\nposted. &rdquo; \n\n\nIndeed, in this instance, it is the Constitution that mandates\nunenforceable laws, tying the hands of future generations in deciding on how\nbest to conduct democratic elections. \n\n \n\nLike the provision limiting the number of terms of office of\nelective officials, such provisions limit rather than enhance the democratic\nexercise.\n\n\nSurely, it is the electorate in every given election who must\ndetermine whom to elect regardless of how many terms of office a candidate\nmay have served, depending on their judgment as to how that candidate had\nperformed while in office. \n\n \n\nBefore this restriction, Philippine democracy was not any worse\nthan it is today.\n\n\nIn fact, the Executive and Legislature at that time had better\nofficials than now despite their having served multiple terms of office.\n\n\nFor example, Recto, Roxas, Laurel, Osme&ntilde;a, etc. \n\n \n\nIt is time we review our Constitution and laws regarding\nelections in order to avoid our laws being ignored because of\nimpracticability or ridiculousness.\n\n\nPerhaps this is the reason why our electoral processes are converted\ninto a circus as in the case of the hearing of the Comelec for the\nqualification of candidates.  \n\n\n\n\n  COUNTING HEADS  \n\n\n By Anne Stephanie Cruz \n\n\nWith Roberto Cruz\n\n \n\nON August 19, the government will release the preliminary results\nof Census 2000.\n\n\nNote that word - \" \" preliminary. &rdquo; \"\n\n\nAnd don't expect final results.\n\n\nThere will be none, unless the government goes to the courts to force\nthose who refuse to cooperate to allow themselves to be counted.\n\n\nAnd end the fighting in Central Mindanao and Sulu one way or another,\nto enable the refugees - even the Muslim separatist rebels and the Abu Sayyaf\nbandits - - to return to their homes and be counted. \n\n \n\n  Not new.  \n\n\nThe census is for enumeration of the population - including\nforeigners living here - and evaluation of housing throughout the country,\nthe National Statistics Office said.\n\n\nJust that.\n\n\nAnd it is not new.\n\n\nIn fact, a census is taken every 10 years and two have been taken\nsince 1980, when the Census Law was passed. \n\n \n\nIt is not dangerous to anybody 's health.\n\n\nAll that the enumerators ask people is their name, age, sex, civil\nstatus, education, religion, occupation, number of children and personal\ninformation on those children, and whether they rent or own their house. \n\n \n\nVilma Malumay, chief of the Databank and Information Service of\nthe National Statistics Office, said the enumeration covers all types of\ndwelling, even push carts, caves, trailers and abandoned railroad coaches\nused as houses.\n\n\nThese are counted and described to help government housing agencies\ndetermine how many more houses are needed. \n\n \n\nBut too many people simply do not understand the purpose of the\ncensus.\n\n\nIn the slums the schoolteachers who have been hired to serve as\nenumerators are turned away, or residents refuse to answer questions in the\nbelief that the information will be used to evict them.\n\n\nIn aff1uent communities in Makati, Quezon City, Mandaluyong and New\nManila, many residents pleading privacy refuse to open their doors to\nenumerators.\n\n\nHostile ones scold enumerators or set their dogs loose on them. \n\n \n\nDespite Teresita Ang-See 's assurance in the TV promotion for the\ncensus, Chinese remain fearful that information from the enumeration will be\nused against them.\n\n\nAt Chinese homes, security guards, peering through peepholes on tall\nsteel gates, refuse to accept census forms and tell enumerators to go away.\n\n\n \n\nWell, the government cannot blame the Chinese.\n\n\nIf they are scared, or even just suspicious, it is because of their\nbad experience with the two previous governments, but especially the last,\nthe administration of President Fidel Ramos.\n\n\nToward the end of the Aquino administration, kidnapping, with rich\nChinese as targets, became a multimillion-peso industry operated by rogue\npolicemen and soldiers.\n\n\nThe Ramos administration created an agency to battle kidnappers, but\nmilitary-types took to shaking down Chinese businessmen, which was just as\nbad as kidnapping them for ransom.\n\n\nNow who knows if the enumerators are really schoolteachers working\nfor the National Statistics Office or agents of the kidnappers casing the\nhomes of rich Chinese? \n\n \n\nAdministrator Tomas Africa of the National Statistics Office has\nordered enumerators experiencing resistance to file reports so that charges\ncan be brought against those refusing to cooperate.\n\n\nUnder the law, those who refuse to give information to the\nenumeration can be fined up to &peso;500 or jailed for three months, or both\nfined and jailed. \n\n \n\nAfrica said the rich may have less need of government, but\ncertain concerns of less fortunate people, like traffic management service\nand police and fire protection, still affect them.\n\n\nWithout them getting counted, road capacities could be\nunderestimated, resulting in the opening of roads in their closed communities\nto the public.\n\n\nAnd municipal governments could underestimate needs in purchasing\nfirefighting equipment, which could result in the roasting of snubs who live\nin high-rise apartment buildings. \n\n \n\nAs for the Chinese, their fear of kidnappers is understandable,\nbut not their fear of the Bureau of Internal Revenue - - even if the\nenumeration is not intended for use by the taxman.\n\n\nEither they answer the call to census or they go to jail. \n\n \n\nThe census, which began on May 1 and should cover 15.3 million\nhomes in the 42,000 villages of the country, has been disrupted by inclement\nweather from May 12 to 18.\n\n\nIt has been extended to the end of the month to make up for lost\ntime.\n\n\nEnumerators, paid &peso;22 without food and transportation allowance\n- - to interview 25 families a day for 20 days, return this week to the\nvillages to resume the count.\n\n\nThey will return to the recalcitrant rich, including the hermetic\nChinese, to try to complete their assignments. \n\n \n\nThat the census cannot be completed in war-torn Central Mindanao\nand bandit-infested Sulu is almost certain.\n\n\nEnumerators have been working in refugee centers, but not all people\ndisplaced by the fighting between the military and the separatist \nMoro  Islamic Liberation front in Central Mindanao or the military\noperation against Abu Sayyaf bandits on Basilan and Jolo are in the refugee\ncenters.\n\n\nMany have fled to the forests, sneaking back into their villages at\nnight for a quick look at their homes, then return to their hiding places in\nthe woods - - where they are beyond the reach of enumerators. \n\n \n\nThe \" preliminary &rdquo; results of the census will not\ninclude them.\n\n\nUnless a special census for Central Mindanao and Sulu is taken after\nthe war and after the Abu Sayyaf has been obliterated, they will not be\nincluded in the final results. \n\n \n\nCould the recalcitrant rich and the cowardly Chinese be scared\ninto having themselves counted?\n\n\nTo be sure not.\n\n\nHave you heard of anybody being sued by the government for not\ncooperating in a census?\n\n\nLike the previous two censuses, Census 2000 will not enumerate all\nFilipinos.", "subdomain":

concrete tanks and metal drums and plastic containers for\nholding water, saucers for holding ornamental potted plants, soft drink\nbottles, water trays of refrigerators with automatic defrosting, air\nconditioner trays, and other containers where water stays for up to seven\ndays--such as flower vases. \n\n \n\nMain outdoor breeding sites for  Aedes \nmosquitoes are holes in trees, bamboo stumps, leaf crevices, earthen jars,\ndiscarded bottles and tins, discarded tires, metal drums, barrels for\ncollecting rainwater, clogged roof gutters, coconut shells and husks, latex\ncollection cups in rubber plantations,  bancas  and small\nfishing boats. \n\n\n  Unsinkable eggs  \n\n \n\nOne alarming fact about  Aedes  mosquito eggs\nis that they can survive for up to six months even when their breeding sites\ngo dry under natural conditions.\n\n\nSome of them hatch when the containers become filled with water\nagain.\n\n\nAnd when the site dries up again and then gets flooded with water\nagain, the remaining unhatched eggs from the same batch could still hatch.\n\n\n \n\nThe  Aedes  mosquito is sometimes called the\ntiger mosquito because of its peculiar white stripes--one type has one\nstripe, another has two--on its legs and back.\n\n\nThe mosquitoes are quite small, compared to other species, and\nmeasure only 5 mm. \n\n \n\nThey are usually found about 50 meters from their breeding sites\nbut can travel up to 200 meters. \n\n \n\nMore  Aedes  mosquitoes are found indoors than\noutdoors.\n\n\nThe   Aedes aegypti   type prefer to rest\nin shaded places indoors, while   Aedes albopictus \n prefer to rest outdoors, in shrubs and trees. \n\n\n  Biting females  \n\n \n\nLike other mosquito species, only the female  Aedes\n bite. \n\n \n\nThe adult female  Aedes  mates and takes its\nfirst blood meal about 48 hours after coming out of its pupa stage.\n\n\nIt can bite several people, depending on how much blood it sucks.\n\n\n \n\nTo lay eggs, it has to be engorged with blood, which may take two\nto five days.\n\n\nEach  Aedes  female can lay up to four batches of\neggs during its life cycle. \n\n \n\nThe male  Aedes  survives an average of 20\ndays, the female 30 days. \n\n \n\n Aedes  mosquitoes are day-biters with peak\nbiting activities at dawn, after sunrise, and before sunset.\n\n\nThey also bite during other times of the day and at night, although\nat a very low density level. \n\n\n  Virus carriers  \n\n \n\nWhat people should keep in mind is that these mosquitoes become\ndengue carriers only after they have bitten a person infected with dengue.\n\n\n \n\nIt takes about eight to 10 days for the virus to multiply in the\nfemale mosquito 's salivary gland before the insect can transmit the virus to\na human. \n\n \n\nA person bitten by a dengue-carrying mosquito does not\nimmediately show symptoms of dengue fever.\n\n\nIt takes from five to seven days for the virus to incubate in the\nhuman body. \n\n \n\nDengue fever is not directly transmitted from person to person.\n\n\n \n\nIt is usually just like flu and rarely causes death, but can\ndevelop into dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. \n\n \n\nIn the latter form, the patient can bleed to death. \n\n\n  Symptoms  \n\n \n\nDengue fever is characterized by an abrupt onset of high fever\nlasting from three to five days, severe headache, pain behind the eyes,\nmuscle and joint pains, nausea and vomiting, and a measles-like rash on the\nchest and upper limbs. \n\n \n\nThese characteristics vary according to the age and general\nhealth of the patient.\n\n\nThis is why the Department of Health is advising people to\nimmediately see a doctor if they suspect they have dengue. \n\n \n\nIt is up to the doctor to determine whether the patient should be\nhospitalized or could be treated at home. \n\n \n\nThe high fever should be treated by sponging and appropriate use\nof paracetamol.\n\n\nAspirin should not be given because it may lead to bleeding and cause\ngastric irritation and acidosis. \n\n \n\nOral rehydration must be attempted in the early stages of fever\nto replace lost body fluids.\n\n\nThe sugar and salt solution used for diarrheal diseases--like oresol\nand commercially available preparations--can be given in repeated small\nquantities.\n\n\nFruit juice is preferable to plain water. \n\n\n  Fatal stage  \n\n \n\nDengue hemorrhagic fever is the fatal stage.\n\n\nIt is characterized by high continuous fever lasting two to seven\ndays that may be accompanied by loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal\npain and subsequent evidence of bleeding like persistent red spots on the\nskin, nose or gum bleeding, coffee-ground vomit, and dark stools. \n\n \n\nThe patient can go into shock. \n\n \n\nThe DOH is advising parents to watch for these danger signs:\nrestlessness, cold clammy skin, sudden abdominal pain, difficulty in\nbreathing, and behavioral change. \n\n \n\nIf any of these symptoms are present, the patient must\nimmediately be brought to a hospital. \n\n \n\nNot all dengue fever cases require intravenous fluids or blood\ntransfusion.\n\n\nDoctors are in the best position to determine when the patient needs\nthese. \n\n \n\nThe DOH has warned that a person who gets infected with dengue\ntoday is not assured of immunity later.\n\n\nThis is because four dengue strains--Types 2, 3, and 4--are currently\ncirculating in the county. \n\n \n\nInfection with one strain gives a person only three months '\nimmunity from the other strains. \n\n\n  More serious  \n\n \n\nAccording to San Lazaro Hospital chief epidemiologist Dr. Eric\nTayag, getting infected with a second and subsequent dengue strain results in\na more serious illness.\n\n\nThis is because the second dengue strain replicates itself after\ndetecting a person 's antibodies to the initial strain. \n\n \n\nThe best way to prevent the spread of dengue is to keep one 's\nenvironment clean, especially the areas that can become  Aedes\n breeding places. \n\n \n\nThis means, among other steps, discarding water in open\ncontainers and replacing water in flower vases every week. \n\n \n\nInsect repellents like lotions can also be used but the DOH warns\nthat these ward off mosquitoes only for a few hours and must therefore be\napplied regularly. \n\n \n\nMosquito nets can be treated with pyrethroid insecticide to\nprevent  Aedes  bites at night.\n\n\nMosquito coils can be used. \n\n \n\nFogging is not usually recommended, except in schools and areas\nwhere there is an epidemic.\n\n\nThe fogging insecticide only kills the adult mosquito while leaving\nmillion of larvae untouched.\n\n\nMosquitoes may also develop resistance to the insecticide.  \n\n\n\n\n  Verdict 's out: Viagra is good for Asians too  \n\n\n Stella O. Gonzalez \n\n \n\nSINGAPORE - -\n\n\nThe results are out and the verdict is much the same as earlier\nclinical trials conducted on American men: Viagra is an effective,\nwell-tolerated drug treatment for impotent Asian men. \n\n \n\nNow it 's up to Asian governments to decide whether they will\nallow the sale of the ballyhooed drug in their countries. \n\n \n\nA report made yesterday during the 4th Asian Congress on Urology\nat the Raffles City Convention Center here said 86 percent of 127 erectile\ndysfunction patients from the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia who\nparticipated in the trial reported improvement in erection after 12 weeks.\n\n\n \n\nA similar test, this time on 130 patients from Hong Kong,\nIndonesia and Thailand, reported 81 percent improved erections. \n\n \n\nViagra, manufactured by Pfizer, has been approved for sale in\nThailand and Australia.\n\n\nAmong other countries awaiting approval from local regulation\nagencies are Japan and those who conducted the Asian clinical trials. \n\n \n\nIt has been estimated that 3.5 million Filipino men are suffering\nfrom erectile dysfunction.\n\n\nIn Asia, one in two men over 40 years old suffer from it and nearly\nhalf of the sufferers have a specific underlying physical cause.\n\n\nThe average age of the impotent Asian man is 46 years. \n\n \n\nThe worldwide estimate is 100 million impotent men. \n\n \n\nThe Asian Sildenafil Efficacy and Safety Study ( ASSESS) by\nViagra ( generic name: Sildenafil) manufacturer Pfizer used 690 patients from\nthe six countries mentioned above plus Taiwan, where testing is ongoing. \n\n\n  \" ASSESS \"  \n\n \n\nParticipants were all Asians, aged 18 years or older, were\nclinically diagnosed to have erectile dysfunction, are not receiving any\nother treatment for ED, and have a stable relationship with a female partner.\n\n\n \n\nThey were grouped into two--one taking Viagra ( not more than\nonce daily) one hour before sexual intercourse, the other a placebo.\n\n\nIt was a randomized, double-blind test where even the doctors who\ngave the medicine did not know who received Viagra and who got the placebo.\n\n\nThe results from the Asian countries were turned over to Pfizer 's\ncentral research group in new York. \n\n \n\n\" ASSESS-1 \" included the Philippines, Singapore\nand Malaysia while \" ASSESS-2 \" covered Hong Kong, Indonesia\nand Thailand. \n\n \n\nIn the Philippines, 67 patients took the placebo and 66 Viagra.\n\n\nIndividual results of the Philippine clinical trial conducted by\nDoctors Benjamin Mendoza, Reynaldo de la Cruz, Telesforo Gana and German Jose\nAlbano are not known.\n\n\nThey have been incorporated into the results of \" ASSESS-1\n\" . \n\n \n\nOf the 127 patients in \" ASSESS-1 \" who took\nViagra, 86 percent reported improved erections while 33 percent who took\nplacebo also reported an improvement.\n\n\nOf the 130 patients in \" ASSESS-2 \" who took Viagra,\n81 percent reported improved erections while 28 percent in the placebo group\nreported an improvement. \n\n \n\nIn \" ASSESS-1 \" , there was a 74-percent success\nat attempted sexual intercourse among Viagra users; in \" ASSESS-2\n\" , 68 percent. \n\n\n  Common side effects  \n\n \n\nThere was no reported incident of a heart attack or stroke among\nthose who took Viagra.\n\n\nOne patient receiving Viagra experienced severe  angina\npectoris  which was not considered to be related to the treatment.\n\n\nOne placebo patient suffered an accidental injury to the hand.\n\n\n( Clinical trial protocol requires the reporting of all ailments\neven if these are not related to the drug-taking).  \n\n\n\n\n  Aspirin: The centennial drug  \n\n\n Tyrone Reyes \n\n \n\nAspirin is one of those things in our lives that seems to have\nbeen with us for as far as we can remember.\n\n\nIn fact, when a Massachusetts Institute of Technology survey gave\n1,000 people a list of inventions and asked them to name the ones they\n \" couldn't live without,\"  the fifth-place finisher - -\nbehind the automobile, light bulb, telephone, and television - - was aspirin!\n\n\nIndeed, aspirin has served humanity well for 100 years now.\n\n\nIt has become the most widely taken drug in the world today.\n\n\nUsed initially as a pain reliever and fever reducer, aspirin has\nproven itself to be a lifesaver too - - an inexpensive and powerful defense\nagainst heart attacks, strokes, and even some forms of cancer.\n\n\nIn today 's column, we 'll look into aspirin 's effectiveness\nagainst heart attack and strokes, and help you decide whether aspirin therapy\nmight be right for you. \n\n\n  Healthy heart  \n\n \n\nThe strongest evidence of aspirin 's effectiveness against major\ndisorders comes from studies on heart attacks - - which occur when a blood\nclot blocks an artery nourishing a portion of the heart muscle.\n\n\nBy inhibiting the clotting process, aspirin helps prevent these\nattacks.\n\n\nAspirin 's heart-protecting abilities were proven in 1988 with the\nreported results of a huge intervention trial, the Physician 's Health Study,\nwhich aimed to determine whether aspirin could stave off first heart attacks.\n\n\nThe Harvard researchers randomly assigned some 22,000 male\nphysicians, aged 40 to 48, to take an ordinary 325 mg. aspirin tablet or a\nplacebo every other day.\n\n\nNeither the men nor the researchers knew which they were taking.\n\n\nMidway through the trial, monitors spotted a striking development:\n44 per cent fewer heart attacks in the aspirin group!\n\n\nThe findings were so convincing, the researchers halted the aspirin\narm of the study early so those taking the placebo pills wouldn't be deprived\nof the possible benefit.\n\n\nThat study, and others that came after, established aspirin as\nessential therapy for most men and women who are at risk for a heart attack\nor who have already had one. \n\n \n\nIn addition to its preventive value, aspirin has also been shown\nto help  treat  a heart attack, if taken promptly in response to\nsymptoms.\n\n\nThe Second International Study of Infarct Survival found taking\naspirin within 24 hours of the onset of a heart attack and then daily for the\nnext month reduced the death rate in both men and women by 25 per cent.\n\n\nAnyone with heart attack symptoms - - chest pain that radiates to\nthe jaw, neck, back, shoulder, or arm, or that 's accompanied by\nlightheadedness, nausea, sweating, or shortness of breath - - should call for\nmedical help immediately, then take a regular 325 mg. aspirin tablet, even if\nhe or she is already on aspirin regimen. \n\n\n  Brain protector  \n\n \n\nThe evidence of aspirin 's benefit against stroke is clearest\nfor people who have already had a stroke or transient ischemic attack ( TIA),\na stroke-like episode causing symptoms that resolve fully within 24 hours.\n\n\nThose people are at increased risk for subsequent strokes.\n\n\nA landmark 1994 review of 145 randomized, controlled trials\ninvolving more than 100,000 people concluded that aspirin cuts that risk by\nabout 25 per cent. \n\n \n\nSome experts feel that aspirin 's anti-clotting could increase\nthe risk of hemorrhagic stroke, caused by bleeding from a burst blood vessel\nin the brain.\n\n\nThat sort of stroke is much less common than ischemic, or\nclot-related, strokes, but more deadly.\n\n\nAnd the 1994 review did hint at a possible trend toward more\nhemorrhagic strokes in aspirin users.\n\n\nHowever, any increase in that risk is far outweighed by a reduction\nin non-hemorrhagic strokes and heart attacks among high-risk people. \n\n\n  The aspirin prescription  \n\n \n\nThere 's more than enough evidence for people who are at risk\nfor a heart attack or stroke to consider going on aspirin.\n\n\nYou may be a candidate if you:\n\n\n* Already have coronary artery disease.\n\n\n( That includes having had a previous heart attack.)\n\n\n* Have reduced blood flow through one of the carotid arteries in the\nneck.\n\n\n* Have had an ischemic stroke or a transient ischemic cerebral\nattack.\n\n\n* Are a post menopausal woman under age 60 or so with two or more of\nthe following risk factors for cardiovascular disease, or an older woman or a\nman over 50 with even one of these risk factors: smoking or steady exposure\nto second-hand smoke, hypertension, diabetes, high LDL cholesterol or low HDL\ncholesterol, severe obesity, heavy alcohol consumption, a family history of\nearly coronary disease ( before age 55) or of ischemic stroke, or a sedentary\nlifestyle. \n\n \n\nThe recommended dosage ranges widely.\n\n\nA daily dose of 81 mg. may be best.\n\n\nThe so-called \" \" baby aspirin &rdquo; \" ( or\nAspilet) has exactly 80 mg. per tablet so this would appear to be sufficient\nfor this purpose.\n\n\nIt 's possible that people at high risk for stroke - - those who\nhave had a previous stroke or transient ischemic attack - - might benefit\nmore from a higher daily dose of 325 mg., since the trials that found a\nstroke benefit so far have used similar dosages. \n\n\n  Aspirin precautions  \n\n \n\nWhile aspirin has substantial benefits, it also has significant\nrisks.\n\n\nThe most common side effect is upper abdominal discomfort - -\nstomach pain, indigestion, or heart burn.\n\n\nBleeding in the stomach is a less frequent but more dangerous\npossibility.\n\n\nEnteric-coated aspirin ( Ecotrin), which dissolves in the small\nintestine rather than the stomach, may help forestall those problems.\n\n\nAnd it helps to take the pills - - enteric-coated or not - - after\nmeals with a full glass of water.\n\n\nStill, the possible adverse effects make it essential to discuss\naspirin therapy with your physician before you begin. \n\n \n\nAny of the following factors in particular may rule out an\naspirin regimen:\n\n\n* A bleeding disorder.\n\n\n* Regular use of an anticoagulant, such as warfarin ( Coumadin) or\nticlopidine ( Ticlid).\n\n\n* A history of stomach ulcers.\n\n\n* Kidney or liver disease.\n\n\n* Diabetic eye complications that can cause vision loss from\nbleeding.\n\n\n* Uncontrolled hypertension.\n\n\n* Regular use of other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or\nNSAIDs, such as diclofenae ( Voltaren), ibuprofen ( Brufen), and naproxen (\nNaprosyn).\n\n\n* A history of hemorrhagic stroke.\n\n\n( A history of ischemic stroke, on the other hand, is a reason to\ntake aspirin, not avoid it.)\n\n\n* A past allergic reaction - - breathing problems, swollen tongue or\nlips, skin rashes - - soon after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs.\n\n\n* Asthma, which raises your risk of an allergic reaction to aspirin.\n\n\n \n\nFinally, anyone taking aspirin who 's scheduled for surgery\nshould ask his or her doctor about going off the drug for a week or so before\nthe operation and a few days afterward, to avoid any bleeding problems during\nsurgery.\n\n\nAnd all aspirin-users should have a blood count done periodically to\nwatch for anemia, a drop in oxygen-carrying red blood cells, due to\nimperceptibly slow loss of blood from the stomach. \n\n \n\nSo aspirin has been convincingly shown to provide protection\nagainst heart attacks and clot-related strokes in high-risk people - - aside\nfrom its well-known pain reliever and fever reducer effects.\n\n\nThe bottom line on aspirin is this: It 's low cost and low dose but\nbig benefits!", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "97728605-5f0f-4291-88fe-9d1d94c16f36", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.245866+00:00"}
{"text": "Nuke test issue: Ecological to political  \n\n\n Leo Magno \n\n \n\nMURUROA 's clock is winding down. \n\n \n\nFrance will resume its nuclear weapons tests in September after\nending a test ban moratorium enacted by then-president Francois Mitterrand in\n1992.\n\n\nNext month, the administration of newly elected French President\nJacques Chirac will press the button that will trigger one of the largest\nunderground explosions in recent memory. \n\n \n\nThis explosion, however, will not be measured in kilotons nor by\nthe way it will make the Earth shudder.\n\n\nThis explosion started in June when France announced its test\nschedule.\n\n\nThis explosion came in the form of global protestations which rocked\nthe French government, an explosion of protest whose booming cries echoed\naround the world. \n\n \n\nAnd here in the Philippines, the explosion is heard loud and\nclear.\n\n\n \" Fallout is going to be the most critical effect of\nthe tests, especially since we are closer to the test site than France is,\n&rdquo;  Science and Technology Secretary William Padolina told the\n\" INQUIRER \" . \n\n \n\nPadolina said fallout effects will depend on wind currents and\nother atmospheric conditions every time France undertakes a nuclear test.\n\n\n \n\nAs explained by Carey Sublette on the Internet 's \"\n\" Nuclear Weapons--Frequently Asked Questions, &rdquo; \"\nfallout is a complex mixture of radioactive isotopes, the composition of\nwhich changes as each isotope decays into other isotopes. \n\n \n\nSublette said many isotopes - - atoms that are either stable or\nradioactive - - make significant contributions to the overall radiation\nlevel.\n\n\nRadiation from some isotopes emerge as particular long-term hazards.\n\n\n \n\nBut how exactly does radiation damage occur?\n\n\nIn other words, how does radiation cause cancer? \n\n \n\nThe \" Earthsavers Movement \" explains that\nradiation and nuclear test pollutants can be taken in by fish or humans\nthrough inhalation, bathing, drinking, eating or through open wounds.\n\n\nThese pollutants can then be incorporated into bones, muscles or\nother organs where they can continue to irradiate cells for a long time. \n\n \n\nWhen radiation enters your body, there is a chance it will\nintersect with one of your cells.\n\n\nInside any cell is a nucleus, which contains chromosomes.\n\n\nIf the radiation happens to pass into the cell nucleus, one of four\nthings can happen.\n\n\nAll four types of exposure subject cells to risk.\n\n\nIn order of decreasing probability, these exposure types are:\n\n\n1) Radiation goes right through the cell and no interaction occurs;\n\n\n2) Radiation does irreparable destruction and cell dies;\n\n\n3) Radiation does damage to nucleus.\n\n\nCell survives in this damaged state.\n\n\nAfter it repetitively divides, it grows into a solid tumor.\n\n\nCancer begins.\n\n\n4) Radiation does repairable damage, and cell returns to normal state\n( very low probability). \n\n \n\nThere are three major theories - - all set by physicians - - as\nto how radiation damages living tissue.\n\n\nThese theories, however, are approximations, and based on broad\nassumptions. \n\n \n\n  * The threshold hypothesis.  \n\n\nThis asserts that there exists a safe level of radiation.\n\n\nIf the dose is low, then the cell repair rate is of the order of the\ndamage rate.\n\n\nHence, you get no resultant damage. \n\n \n\n  * The linear hypothesis.  \n\n\nUnder this theory, you would expect one malignant cancer per 1000\nperson-REMs ( Roentgen Equivalent Man, a unit of radiation dose equivalent).\n\n\nFor example, you would find one cancerous patient if you expose 500\npeople to two REMs, or 10,000 people to 0.1 REMs. \n\n \n\n  * The supralinear hypothesis.  \n\n\nThe main result here is that for low doses, you get more cancer cases\nper person-REM than at high doses.\n\n\nThe theory states that you don't get more radiation.\n\n\nInstead, you get more damaged but surviving cells. \n\n \n\nThe \" Earthsavers Movement \" maintains that\nradiation from the French nuclear tests will affect not only the French\nPolynesian area but adjacent areas as well - - even the Philippines. \n\n \n\nThe Philippines is only 9,000 km from Mururoa.\n\n\nIn comparison, the test site is 24,000 km from Paris. \n\n \n\nBut France has reiterated that proximity is not the issue here.\n\n\nFrench presidential adviser Andre Giraud, a former French defense\nminister, said it was regrettable that French nuclear testing in the Pacific\nhas caused a tidal wave of protests.\n\n\nHe insisted, however, that the tests have nothing to do with other\ncountries. \n\n \n\n\n \" We are in France in Mururoa, thousands of miles from\nother countries. \n\n\nI would say mind your business, &rdquo;  said Giraud, who\nheaded the  Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique  from 1970\nto 1978. \n\n \n\nPadolina said the Philippines is wary of the effects of any\nnuclear test, and that radiation measurements are closely being monitored.\n\n\n \n\n \" We have our detectors ready to measure changes in\nradiation levels,\"  he said.\n\n\n \" In fact, radiation levels in the country have been\nmonitored for quite a while now.\n\n\nAll we can do now is to support the protest of the administration - -\nand the protest of other countries - - against the French nuclear tests.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThe French argue that minimal and non-lethal levels of radiation\nwill be emitted by the tests since the explosion will be triggered 1,008\nmeters below the ground. \n\n \n\n\" Greenpeace \" activists counter, however, that\nthere is no safe level of radiation exposure. \n\n \n\nThe ecological consequences of the French nuclear tests may be\nhazy due to a lack of concrete data on their possible effects.\n\n\nSolid proof of the tests ' ecological damage on the Pacific islands -\n- if any - - has yet to be offered.\n\n\nThe tests ' potential harm to the global food chain has also been\ndismissed as futuristic and purely hypothetical. \n\n \n\nThe emotional tide of the possible damage the nuclear tests could\ndo continues to crash on the shores of France in a tidal wave of protests.\n\n\n \n\nYet, the environmental side of the issue is slowly being\nrelegated to the background.\n\n\nFrance now sees the issue as a political rather than an environmental\none.\n\n\n  \" If anyone put that pressure on the US or Russia,\ndo you think they would stop? \n\n\nThere is no way we would stop,\"  said French nuclear\nphysicist Alain Barthoux. \n\n \n\nIn short, France 's decision to press the nuclear trigger has\nbeen reduced to a matter of politics rather than being made on the bases of\nglobal ecological welfare.  \n\n\n\n\n  Countdown  \n\n\n  34 days before the French nuclear tests  \n\n\n Leo Magno \n\n \n\nTHIRTY-FOUR days from now, on Sept. 15, France will resume its\nunderground nuclear tests beneath the atolls of Mururoa and Fangataufa in\nFrench Polynesia.\n\n\nThirty-four hundred years from now the children of France - - and\nprobably the children of every nation - - will know whether that decision was\nright or wrong. \n\n \n\nOn June 13, the French government announced it would resume\nnuclear weapons testing in the Pacific.\n\n\nThese \" last &rdquo; few tests will be conducted between\nSeptember and May next year, before the signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban\nTreaty in 1996. \n\n \n\nFrance was slapped with protests, and petitions to stop them\nlashed at the French government like raindrops on hot, arid earth.\n\n\nDozens of petitions - - with tens of thousands of signatories - -\nriddled the wires of the Internet. \n\n \n\nMounting pressure forced France to lessen the number of tests\nfrom eight to seven, but the government refused to stop the nuclear clock.\n\n\nNuclear physicists handpicked by the government fueled the fire when\nthey reported that no traces of excess radioactivity within the test sites\nwere found.\n\n\nThey added that smoking is more likely to produce cancer in humans\nthan swimming in the area. \n\n \n\nHowever, French defense department documents released Aug. 2 have\nshown that at least three nuclear tests have caused radioactive contamination\nin the Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls.\n\n\nThese sites, the documents show, have been contaminated over years of\nunderground testing. \n\n \n\nFrance conducted its first atmospheric nuclear test in Algeria in\n1960.\n\n\nFrom 1960-1966, 17 tests were conducted in the Pacific test site,\nincluding four in the atmosphere and 13 underground.\n\n\nFrom 1966 to 1992, 175 nuclear tests were detected in the Pacific\ntest site, including 44 atmospheric tests ( 39 at Mururoa, five at\nFangataufa), and 131 underground tests ( 123 at Mururoa, eight at\nFangataufa). \n\n \n\nIn 1992, then president Francois Mitterrand imposed a moratorium\non nuclear weapons testing.\n\n\nThree years later under a new administration, the French government\nannounced the resumption of nuclear weapons testing in the South Pacific.\n\n\n \n\nOther environmental missions support the French defense\ndepartment findings.\n\n\nIn 1983, a six-man mission inspected the Mururoa area and found that\nthe Mururoa atoll is sinking prematurely.\n\n\nThe mission also discovered that water in underground test sites\ncontains radioactive elements.\n\n\nThese elements may spread to the waters of the Pacific and affect the\nentire food chain, the study concluded. \n\n \n\nHowever, government physicists contend that fish will have to\ndigest a huge amount of plutonium for them to be toxic to humans. \n\n \n\nThe issue of defining the level by which radioactivity can be\nharmful to humans is now being addressed by a global union of physicists.\n\n\nIn an open letter posted Wednesday on the Internet, the Committee for\nResearch and Independent Information on Radioactivity ( CRII-RAD), an\nindependent association of nuclear specialists, challenged the findings of\nFrance that underground nuclear testing has minimal effects on the\nenvironment. \n\n \n\nThe CRII-RAD 's headquarters is in Valence, France.\n\n\nThe group has been instrumental in averting global environmental\ndangers.\n\n\nCRII-RAD gave this alert when the Chernobyl radioactive cloud passed\nover France. \n\n \n\n\n \" It is wrong to declare that subterranean atomic\nexplosions are without any consequences to the environment. \n\n\nThe bomb itself is made of radioactive materials ( uranium, tritium,\nplutonium) and its explosion causes a considerable addition to the initial\nradioactivity, through the creation of new radioactive substances,\" \nCRII-RAD declared. \n\n \n\nThe CRII-RAD added that repeated explosions have created, in the\nbody of the atoll, enormous accumulations of radioactive waste permeating an\nimmense network of cracks particularly conducive to their dissemination. \n\n\n \n\n \" The question is not one of knowing whether or\nnot the environment is contaminated - - the contamination is a scientific\nfact - - but to determine how far the particles ( radionuclides) will travel,\nand how long it will take for them to be incorporated in the food chain, and\nto reach human beings. &rdquo;   \n\n \n\nThe CRII-RAD maintains that any absorption of radioactive\nelements - - however weak they may be - - produces a risk of cancer to anyone\nexposed, and a genetic risk for their future children. \n\n \n\nThe group also noted that all information about the state of\nhealth of soldiers and French-Polynesian inhabitants is classified \"\n\" Top Secret. &rdquo; \"  \n\n \n\n \" In any case, nobody can be sure to what degree\nthe atoll is currently contaminated.\n\n\nContrary to what has been stated, the French scientists called in\nto investigate Mururoa were not free to choose where they investigated.\n\n\nThe guidance of the visits by the military authorities must give\nrise to suspicion as to the state of the zones that were forbidden. &rdquo;\n  \n\n \n\nCRII-RAD requested Wednesday the permission to organize a study\nmission on Mururoa, in association with other independent scientists.\n\n\nThe authorization, they said, should clearly stipulate that the\nmilitary authorities will allow access to all parts of the atoll, allow them\nto take any measurements or collect any samples that they may judge\nnecessary.  \n\n \n\n \" If the President of the Republic has been led\ninto error about the ecological impact of the explosions on the environment,\nit could have been the same for the rest of the dossier.\n\n\nGiven the nature of the stakes, and from whatever position one\nstarts, it is altogether dangerous to put the future into the hands of a\nsmall group of experts who have yet to prove that they act on behalf of the\ngeneral welfare and not for private interests. &rdquo;   \n\n \n\nAnd yet, France has declared that no amount of protests will\nmake it cancel the tests.\n\n\nThe clock continues to tick for Mururoa and Fangataufa.  \n\n\n\n\n  Death by exposure  \n\n\n Leo Magno \n\n \n\n \" AT this point, the only thing the Philippines\ncan do about the nuclear tests of China and France is to join the worldwide\nprotest against nuclear weapons and weapons testing. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nSo said with finality Dr. Carlito Aleta, director of the\nDepartment of Science and Technology 's Philippine Nuclear Research\nInstitute.\n\n\nThe PNRI is the country 's authority on nuclear energy. \n\n \n\nThe PNRI has repeatedly been invited to hearings by Senators\nFrancisco Tatad and Heherson Alvarez since France announced in June that it\nwould continue testing nuclear weapons in French Polynesia.\n\n\nThe Senate wanted to find out the possible effects of the French and\nChinese nuclear tests on the Philippines. \n\n \n\nAleta said the PNRI and the Senate were inevitably driven to\nground zero: effects or no effects, France will detonate its test bombs next\nmonth. \n\n \n\nThis was confirmed Thursday by French government spokesperson\nFrancois Baroin, who said that President Jacques Chirac is adamant on\nfollowing the scheduled tests. \n\n \n\nOn Wednesday, Congress approved a resolution condemning the\nFrench and Chinese nuclear tests.\n\n\nThe bottomline, it appears, is that all that can be done now is to\ncondemn and protest the action. \n\n\n  The French agenda  \n\n \n\n \" Nuclear weapons testing is done for three\nprimary reasons, &rdquo;  Aleta said.\n\n\n \" First, to test a new weapon; second, to find out the\nbomb 's effects to people and property; and third, as a safety test,\nespecially when the bombs have been on the stockpile for a long period and\nyou want to see if they still work. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nOf these three reasons, President Chirac justified his\nadministration 's action based on the third - - that France is doing the test\nmerely to check the reliability of its aging arsenal. \n\n \n\nAmerican scientists suspect, however, that France is conducting\nits tests to develop new types of warhead.\n\n\nScientists say French officials are misleading the public when they\nclaim that a few more tests in Mururoa and Fangataufa will allow France to\nsimulate nuclear explosions by computer.\n\n\nThe US said not even Washington has such a technology, and that\ncomputer simulation is unlikely to replace actual nuclear testing. \n\n\n  A lingering health issue  \n\n \n\nLast week, China detonated an underground nuclear test in Lop\nNor, Xinjiang province, 2,400 km west of Beijng.\n\n\nThe bomb was the fourth detonated by China in the last 14 months.\n\n\n \n\nIn 20 days, France will pull its own nuclear trigger in Mururoa.\n\n\n \n\nAlthough the biological effects of these underground tests are\npoorly documented, reports have it that the areas of Xinjiang and Mururoa are\nslowly being contaminated. \n\n \n\nThere are reports of unusually high cancer rates at Chinese\ncommunities in China 's Xinjiang province. \n\n \n\nThe Committee for Research and Independent Information on\nRadioactivity, an independent association of nuclear specialists based in\nValence, France, noted that all information about the state of health of\nFrench Polynesia inhabitants are classified \" \" Top Secret\n&rdquo; \" by the government. \n\n \n\n\" Greenpeace \" activists stress that the\neffects of nuclear testing are long-term.\n\n\nTake for example the world 's first atomic device detonated at the\nTrinity Site in Alamogordo, New Mexico on July 16, 1945.\n\n\nThe bomb, with a yield of 20 kilotons of trinitrotoluene ( TNT),\ncontinued to emit radiation until 1961 - - 16 years after the test was\nconducted. \n\n\n  Radiation 101  \n\n \n\nThe PNRI 's Aleta said radiation does not cause immediate\ncasualties. \n\n \n\n \" There are some accidents, though, that are\ntragic, &rdquo;  he said, citing the catastrophe at Chernobyl in the\nformer Soviet Union. \n\n \n\nThe accident at the nuclear power plant which occurred on April\n26, 1986, claimed 31 lives.\n\n\nThree died on the spot, while the other 28 expired due to radiation\nover the next two months. \n\n \n\nYet, the Chernobyl incident was an accident involving a nuclear\npower plant.\n\n\nNuclear weapons, on the other hand, are  designed  to\nproduce human casualties.\n\n\nThese casualties are produced by the blast, by thermal radiation and\nby nuclear radiation. \n\n Nuclear radiation damage is inflicted almost solely upon human beings and\nother living organisms whose living tissues are eaten away by radiation. \n\n \n\n \" All humans absorb some natural and artificial\nradiation ( such as X-ray), &rdquo;  Aleta said.\n\n\n \" Although the body seems to be capable of coping with\nthis degree of radiation, harmful effects can follow. &rdquo;", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "8420a3f9-4b6e-4fdb-9325-6550b251e2e4", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.247642+00:00"}
{"text": "Another new method for infertile couples  \n\n\n Alex Y. Vergara \n\n \n\nSCIENCE has already gone one step further than the popular\n\n in vitro  fertilization ( IVF) with the introduction of\nthe intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI). \n\n \n\nRecent advances in reproductive medicine now offer hope to\nchildless couples who have tried almost everything--from popping fertility\npills to dancing to  Sta. Clara  - - in vain. \n\n \n\nAssisted reproductive techniques such as IVF have tremendously\nimproved since Louise Brown, the first so-called \" test tube baby\n\" , was born in 1978. \n\n \n\nDr. Virgilio Novero said more than 100,000 test tube babies have\nbeen born in the world over since then. \n\n \n\nAlthough there 's a slim 20 percent chance of getting pregnant\nthrough IVF, Dr. Gilda German-Martinez said this hasn't stopped countless\nFilipino couples from spending &peso;250,000 for the procedure. \n\n \n\nNovero and Martinez are two of the country 's leading\nobstetricians-gynecologists ( ob-gyn) who specialize in infertility and\nreproductive medicine. \n\n \n\nDeveloped in Brussels, Belgium, ICSI is said to be more reliable\nthan IVF in helping infertile couples fulfill their dream of having children.\n\n\n\n  Two methods, different genders  \n\n \n\nStill, the two methods aren't totally different since doctors\nmerely improved on IVF to arrive at ICSI.\n\n\nBoth procedures are also done outside the woman 's body and inside\nthe laboratory. \n\n \n\nIn an IVF procedure, the doctor first gets the husband 's sperm\nsample which later undergoes the \" sperm-washing &rdquo; technique.\n\n\nAfter extracting the wife 's egg cell, the sperm sample is dropped\ninto it until both sperm and egg develop into an embryo. \n\n \n\nWhen the embryo reaches its fourth to eighth stage of\ndevelopment, the doctor returns it to the mother 's uterus where it will\neventually develop into a full-grown baby. \n\n \n\nFertilization is no guarantee, though, especially if the husband\nproduces sperm cells of low quality. \n\n \n\nStill, doctors have overcome this obstacle with the development\nof ICSI. \n\n \n\nInstead of dropping the sperm into the egg, doctors now inject\nthe sperm directly into the egg during an ICSI procedure thus dramatically\nincreasing the chances of fertilization. \n\n \n\n \" That 's why IVF is more for female factor\nfertility, while ICSI is for male factor infertility, &rdquo;  said\nNovero. \n\n\n  Less costly, more conventional  \n\n \n\nMany infertile couples, though, need not undergo these extreme\nmeasures, said Martinez.\n\n\nBased on her experience, 90 percent of her patients can still avail\nthemselves of less expensive but more conventional means to have kids. \n\n \n\n \" After a couple undergoes a thorough examination,\nI lay down the best options for them to choose, &rdquo;  she said.\n\n\n \" Why give them expensive tests when it won't help\nthem? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nBased on an American medical study, 35 percent of infertility\namong couples is traced to women, compared to 30 percent to men.\n\n\nAround 25 percent is traced to both couples, while 10 percent remains\nunknown. \n\n \n\nBoth doctors define infertility as the absence of pregnancy after\none year of unprotected sexual intercourse.\n\n\nCouples who fall under this category should see a doctor before the\nwomen 's biological clock runs out. \n\n \n\nMedical studies show that a woman 's chances of getting pregnant\ndeclines after she reaches 37. \n\n \n\n \" Many couples who visit my clinic have been\nchildless for four to five years, &rdquo;  said Novero.\n\n\nBut there are some couples who are still hoping to hear the\npitter-patter of little feet after 20 years of trying. \n\n\n  Common problems  \n\n \n\nIrregular menstrual periods, infections and blocked fallopian\ntubes are just some of the most common causes of infertility among women.\n\n\nThere are women, for instance, who menstruate annually, meaning they\novulate or release an egg only once a year. \n\n \n\nUnless the couple makes love during this rare but brief period,\nthe possibility of the wife getting pregnant is, indeed, very slim. \n\n \n\n \" It 's basically a hormonal problem which can be\ncorrected through medication, &rdquo;  said Martinez. \n\n \n\nOnce the woman attains a normal menstrual cycle, the doctor\nadvises the couple to time their sexual intercourse during ovulation.\n\n\nThis can be determined by taking the woman 's temperature or by\nsubjecting her to an ultrasound test. \n\n \n\nMeanwhile, the leading causes of infertility among men are poor\nsperm count and motility ( movement). \n\n \n\nA man normally ejaculates about 50 million sperm cells during the\nclimax of a sex act.\n\n\nMales with deficient sperm counts, however, cough up less than 20\nmillion. \n\n \n\nAccording to standards set by the World Health Organization, a\nman needs at least 20 million sperm cells to impregnate a woman. \n\n \n\nSome men are able to enrich their reproductive fluid though\nmedication.\n\n\nMany, however, need to have their sperm cells \" washed &rdquo;\nin a laboratory before they are artificially inseminated to a woman. \n\n \n\nWhat about in cases where sperm cells die because of their\ninability to pass through a blocked  vas deferens  , the\nduct that transports sperm from the testis into the urethra for ejaculation?\n\n\n \n\nSince the area is too delicate to tinker with, men with this\ncondition have resorted to adopting kids or having their wives artificially\ninseminated with someone else 's sperm. \n\n \n\nNot anymore, though.\n\n\nSome doctors have now skipped the blocked  vas deferens\n by extracting sperm cells directly from the testicles. \n\n \n\n \" Recent advances in the treatment of male\ninfertility led one of my Belgian professors to predict the end of male\nsterility by the 21st century, &rdquo;  said Novero. \n\n \n\nAs long as their ovaries are intact, a woman with no uterus can\nalso defy nature by hiring a surrogate mother. \n\n \n\nLike in an IVF procedure, the woman 's egg is extracted and\nfertilized with the husband 's sperm.\n\n\nInstead of putting the embryo back to her, however, it is placed in\nthe womb of another woman. \n\n \n\nA woman with damaged ovaries can still bear children as long as\nher uterus is still intact.\n\n\nAfter getting an egg from a donor, and having it fertilized by her\nhusband 's sperm, the embryo can now be transferred to her. \n\n \n\nSome of these radical procedures may be available to infertile\ncouples abroad.\n\n\nBut it won't be long before they catch on among child-loving\nFilipinos bent on continuing their legacy here.  \n\n\n\n\n  How to make acupuncture work for you  \n\n\n Marge C. Enriquez \n\n \n\nSTRESS comes in monstrous forms--sleepless nights, sluggishness,\nfrequent bouts of colds, diarrhea, constipation, increased smoking, edginess,\novereating or anorexia, anger over small matters, or just crying. \n\n \n\n \" Even his officemates hate him, &rdquo; \nwives complain about their stressed out husbands. \n\n \n\nIf three tranquilizers no longer work to calm you down, there 's\na drugless way to control stress before it controls you.\n\n\nAcupuncture, one of the healing modalities in ancient Chinese\nmedicine, is based on the belief that there are patterns of energy flow, or\n  qi   , throughout the body.\n\n\nBlockage of the energy flow is believed to result in disease.\n\n\nThe acupuncturist can check the imbalances of   qi \n at points close to the skin. \n\n \n\nThin metallic needles are used to prick the skin to stimulate the\nareas which correspond to certain organs of the body. \n\n \n\nAcupuncture helps the body to heal itself, while allopathic\nmedicine neutralizes certain body reactions to make the person feel better.\n\n\n \n\nChinese medicine believes man is a spirit with a physical body\nand energy.\n\n\nAcupuncture is healing through manipulation of this energy. \n\n \n\nDr. Francis Gomez, associate consultant at Intercare Healthcare\nSystem and a proponent of acupuncture, explains:  \" Man is a\nmicrocosm of nature.\n\n\nThe interplay in nature is true in the body. &rdquo; \n\n\nThe characteristics of the elements--earth, water, wind, air, fire\nand metal--are also found in man 's organs, he adds. \n\n \n\nAnother concept is that the   qi   or\nenergy has two characteristics--   yin   which is\nfeminine and cool, and   yang   which is hot,\ndynamic and masculine.\n\n\nThese two energies complement each other and an imbalance leads to\nailments. \n\n \n\nCertain emotions correspond to specific organs.\n\n\nThese emotions can either weaken or strengthen an organ depending on\nthe person 's attitude. \n\n\n  Tongue  \n\n \n\nDiagnosing the disease in acupuncture is similar to western\nmedicine--inspection, palpitation, auscultation and interview on the illness\nand lifestyle of the patient 's parents.\n\n\nGomez looks at the patient 's tongue and feels his pulse, which\nreflect the state of his internal organs.\n\n\nHe looks at the tongue 's coating, color, thickness, cracks,\nmoisture, and teeth marks. \n\n \n\n \" The tongue gives a history, &rdquo;  he\nsays.\n\n\n \" It provides me a guide. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nTeeth marks on the tongue show that the spleen is taxed, he says.\n\n\nThis in turn affects bowel movement and mucus retention. \n\n \n\nThe doctor interprets the data in terms of pattern of imbalances\nand proceeds accordingly. \n\n \n\nFilament needles are used to penetrate specific sites which\naffect the body 's energy flow.\n\n\nThe patients will either feel pain, distentions, tingling, numbness\nor warmth in the pricked areas, or the sensation will circulate through the\nnormal path of the   qi   . \n\n \n\n \" Chinese medicine releases the congested \n qi   which may have stagnated in the liver and heart,\n&rdquo;  says Gomez.\n\n\n \" The good thing about Chinese medicine is that you can\nchannel the energy to other organs and tissues.\n\n\nAcupuncture works to relieve stress and tension.\n\n\nIn a way, you 're relieving the mental and psychological stress.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nMore than half of the patients feel relieved and fall asleep in\nthe first session.\n\n\nGomez advises them to refrain from heavy work, taking alcohol and\nexposing the punctured areas to water to avoid disrupting the energy flow.\n\n\n \n\n \" For people under stress, there 's a physical\nbreakdown, &rdquo;  he says.\n\n\n \" The body can't adjust to the load.\n\n\nIt 's as if you have a rope tied to the load, and you can lift only\nso many kilos.\n\n\nAdding to the load are the worrying and other psychological\ncomponents. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThis is why Gomez recommends meditation to get people to slow\ndown their minds.\n\n\nThinking too much is a major factor in draining one 's energy. \n\n\n  Massage  \n\n \n\nTo beat stress, Gomez recommends cutting down on red meat and\nwhite sugar which are more   yang   .\n\n\n \" When you 're stressed, there 's an excess of\n  yang   .\n\n\nIf you take in more   yang   , it 's\nlike adding more charcoal to the stove. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nAt home,   tuina   or Chinese\nmassage is recommended if done by a member of the family.\n\n\nIt involves using pressure and massage techniques over acupuncture\npoints to circulate the   qi   . \n\n \n\nGomez also suggests going out of town, swimming in the beach and\nsoaking in salt water which absorbs negative energy. \n\n \n\nGomez studied acupuncture to go hand in hand with his medical\npractice.\n\n\nWhen he was in medical school he had a bad case of chronic allergic\nrhinitis, chronic sinusitis, and septal deviation from playing football.\n\n\nHe took decongestants and antibiotics but the former gave him\npalpitations. \n\n \n\n \" I was sick with premature ventricular\ncontractions, &rdquo;  he recalls.\n\n\n \" I was too young. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nNot taking the medicines would make Gomez so feeble that he\ncouldn't attend lectures or exams.\n\n\nBut he was just as ill when he took them, that they even triggered\nhis asthma. \n\n \n\nGomez chucked his medicines for the acupuncture needles and was\ndecongested after three months, with only a postnasal drip left. \n\n \n\nGomez went to China under a grant to study this healing system.\n\n\nHe is founding president of the Philippine Academy of Medical\nAcupuncture Inc., which aims to provide a well-rounded, holistic health care\nsystem, including acupuncture. \n\n \n\nIf you want to know more about Chinese traditional medicine,\ncontact Dr. Francis Gomez at Intercare Healthcare System at 2028 M.

{"text": "\" Waterworld \" , a science fiction film depicting\na landless Earth after the polar ice caps shall have melted, may have more\nbasis in reality than people would care to think. \n\n \n\nScientists already have a term for the Waterworld scenario:\n\" accelerated sea level rise, \" or ASLR.\n\n\nAnd the culprit behind ASLR?\n\n\nClimate change, in this case global warming, which is the result of\nmillions of years of gas and vapor emissions that form an insulating layer\naround the earth. \n\n \n\nScientists note that, in the course of a few generations,\nemissions from industry, vehicles and other human activities have multiplied\nmore than 50 times, trapping heat in the atmosphere like a giant greenhouse.\n\n\n \n\nThe result is increased temperatures, more rain and ASLR - - all\nphysical changes that have serious economic and ecological consequences.\n\n\nBut the news gets worse: while developed countries are largely\nresponsible for such emissions, developing countries like the Philippines\nwill bear the brunt of the changes. \n\n \n\n \" Developing nations are expected to be hardest hit,\n&rdquo;  said Gregorio Estrada, technical director of the\nEnvironmental Management of Protected Areas System of the Department of\nEnvironment and Natural Resources in Region 7.\n\n\nEstrada was among several speakers in a regional seminar-workshop on\nclimate change held in Cebu recently. \n\n \n\n \" The sea level has risen 10 to 20 centimeters\nduring the last decade; by 2100 it could be 65 cms higher than its level\ntoday, &rdquo;  Estrada said.\n\n\nHe forecast such grim possibilities as flooded ports and communities.\n\n\n \n\nThe Philippines, whose coastline stretches 18,000 kilometers, is\nvery vulnerable to the rising sea levels, one of the most certain outcomes of\nglobal warming, said Dr. Rosa Perez, a weather specialist of the Philippine\nAtmospheric Geophysical Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA). \n\n \n\nIn her paper entitled \" \" Vulnerability Assessments\nand Evaluation of Adaptations on Coastal Resources due to ASLR, &rdquo;\n\" Perez wrote that once sea levels rise, low-lying areas would be\ninundated, erosion would worsen, seawater would intrude into estuaries and\naquifers ( already starting in Cebu), and damage due to flooding and storms\nwould be greater. \n\n \n\nBuildings along the coasts will be affected, and coastal\ncommunities will have to find new sources of livelihood.\n\n\nCoral reefs may also be destroyed.\n\n\nCertain species of wildlife may die out. \n\n \n\nPerez led a research team to study rising-sea scenarios in Manila\nBay from Cavite City in the south up to Metro Manila and in the north,\nHagonoy, Bulacan.\n\n\nThe team indicated that the sea could rise to a low of 0.3 meters up\nto a high of 2 meters by 2100. \n\n \n\nAll of Cavite, Perez predicted, will see a sea-level rise of at\nleast 30 centimeters.\n\n\nWith every meter that it rises, the sea goes at least three\nkilometers inland, she said.\n\n\nThe sea will literally rise to flood the plains. \n\n \n\n \" Is the government ready? &rdquo;  Perez\nasked.\n\n\nBy the end of this century, the country will see  \"\nenvironmental refugees,\"  she warned. \n\n \n\nMeanwhile, using simulations in climate change, a  PAGASA\n team has found that water supply from both Angat Dam in Luzon and\nLake Lanao in Mindanao would be at a serious deficit by 2050.\n\n\nNathaniel Cruz,  PAGASA  supervising weather\nspecialist, is studying the possible effects of sea-level rise on both water\nsources. \n\n \n\nAngat Dam supplies most of the water requirements of Metro\nManila.\n\n\nIt irrigates 28,000 hectares of farms, and generates an annual\nelectric energy of 529 Gwh for the Luzon grid.\n\n\nLake Lanao accounts for 90 percent of the total hydropower source of\nMindanao and serves domestic and irrigation water needs as well. \n\n \n\nAlthough climate change has been one of the most studied\nenvironmental problems since the late 1950s, most studies have made only\nlong-term projections, said Lando Velasco, technical adviser of the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( 1992) and a member of the\nPhilippine Inter-Agency Committee on Climate Change. \n\n \n\nVelasco said that Filipinos will actually start to suffer from\nthe effects of global warming and weather change in the next 50 years.\n\n\nHe said government must now make serious studies on the effects of\nchanging climate. \n\n \n\n \" Studies on agricultural productivity, for\nexample, do not factor in climate change and environmental degradation,\n&rdquo;  he said.\n\n\n \" Government keeps pushing technology transfer, but\nthere are no studies on the impacts of such shifts to new technologies.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nMeanwhile, the video documentary \" \" 2048--The\nGreenhouse Effect &rdquo; \" warns that emissions of carbon dioxide,\nwhich account for most greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, would be five\ntimes what it is today if developing countries copied the energy habits of\nrich countries.\n\n\nAbout six billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions are deposited into\nthe atmosphere every year, according to another documentary. \n\n \n\nBoth films were produced by the Television Trust for\nEntertainment for the United Nations Environmental Program. \n\n\n( PNF) \n\n\n\n\n  Ebola threat in the Philippines  \n\n\n Monica Feria \n\n \n\nScience Fiction writer Stephen King described \" \"\nThe Hot Zone, &rdquo; \" a true-to-life account of the emergence of\nthe new killer virus Ebola, as one of the most horrifying things he has ever\nread. \n\n \n\nIn this book, award-winning American author Richard Preston\ndescribed the gruesome debut of this lethal and highly-contagious organism in\nZaire and Sudan in 1976 and revealed a top secret military-civilian operation\nin 1989 in response to the suspected entry of Ebola into a suburban town not\nfar from populous Washington D.C. \n\n \n\nThe virus that was to spark one of the worst biochemical scares\nin U.S. history came from monkeys imported from an area halfway around the\nglobe from Africa--the Philippines. \n\n \n\n\" Ebola \" , named after a river in an area of\nCentral Africa where the first Ebola epidemic struck, is possibly the\ndeadliest virus to stalk the planet - - so far.\n\n\nIt attacks a host much like the way termites attack a wooden\nhouse--chewing up internal organs until the body, reduced to a bag of mush\nand bones, crashes and bleeds to death.\n\n\nIt is said that Ebola will do in 10 days what it will take the\nAIDS-causing HIV virus 10 years to accomplish.\n\n\nThere is yet no known cure.\n\n\n \" Compared to Ebola, AIDS is child 's play, &rdquo;\n said one South African doctor. \n\n \n\nUnder the microscope, the thread-like viral strain ( called a\nfilovirus) that was killing monkeys in 1989 at a holding facility in Reston,\nVirginia, looked similar to the one that wiped out close to 600 people in\nZaire and Sudan. \n\n \n\nThe facility was owned by a company named Hazleton Research\nProducts or HRP which was undertaking the importation and sale of laboratory\nanimals.\n\n\nThe monkey stock had come from Ferlite Scientific Research Inc., an\nexport company which had collected the animals from the forests of Zamboanga\non Mindanao Island, then raised and quarantined them in a facility in Laguna,\na province just south of Manila. \n\n \n\nIn Reston, narrates Preston, space suitclad army volunteers\nquietly moved into the HRP facility, killed all the monkeys and \" nuked\nit &rdquo; ( army slang for full decontamination operations). \n\n \n\nThe dramatic ending of Preston 's account is cause for global\nrelief: the Ebola strain in Reston was found to be not harmful to humans.\n\n\nFour workers at the Virginia farm were infected but suffered only\nminor symptoms and are alive up to today.\n\n\nThe new strain was named \" Ebola-Reston \" , to\ndistinguish it from Ebola-Zaire, Ebola-Sudan, and Marburg--the virus\ndiscovered in a German holding farm in 1967 among monkeys imported from\nUganda. \n\n \n\nBut the Reston incident has raised some very disturbing\nquestions.\n\n\nWhy is the Ebola virus bursting out into humankind only in recent\nyears?\n\n\nWhere did it come from?\n\n\nDid the virus travel from Africa to the Philippines?\n\n\nOr is it home-grown in southeast Asia?\n\n\nDid the Zaire virus begin like the mild Ebola-Reston then mutate into\nvirulent form?\n\n\nUp to now, reports Preston, the U.S. army medics have not downgraded\nthe status of Ebola-Reston from \" \" biolevel 4, &rdquo;\n\" the category for highly dangerous organisms or hot agents.\n\n\n( The HIV virus is classified \" \" biolevel 3. &rdquo;\n\" ) \n\n \n\nToo little is known about Ebola virus and scientists warn against\nletting down our guard.\n\n\n \" Any virus that has the ability to change or mutate\ntheoretically has the possibility of becoming virulent--that is a concern,\n&rdquo;  stressed Gerald Stokes of George Washington University in\nthe CNN report.\n\n\nEbola-Reston, because of its observed ability to travel not just\nthrough blood and mucus transfers but also through the air, may potentially\nbe the most dangerous of the filovirus sisters, others speculate. \n\n \n\nAn increasing number of emerging or re-emerging viruses are\nmaking their presence felt and not a few scientists believe that they will\nsquare off with humankind in the 21st century.\n\n\nIn this sense, the more chilling part of \" \" The Hot\nZone &rdquo; \" may be its still unfolding postscript.\n\n\nFor example, what the U.S. and Philippine officials did to prevent\nfurther infections after 1989: virtually nothing. \n\n\n  EXPORT REQUIREMENTS  \n\n \n\nImport-export requirements have not changed.\n\n\nTests required on animals crossing national borders are set by the\nimporting countries.\n\n\nEach country protects its own territory with import regulations and\nquarantine procedures.\n\n\nAmong monkeys, tests are usually required for tuberculosis and yellow\nfever.\n\n\nSome international buyers require tests for salmonella and the\n\" B &rdquo; virus or herpes.\n\n\n( This virus, by the way, is non-fatal among monkeys but can kill\nhumans if they are infected through bites or scratches.) \n\n \n\nNo country, up to now, requires Ebola test clearances. \n\n \n\nAfter the HRP monkey stock in Reston had been euthanized in\nDecember of 1989, imports resumed.\n\n\nIn March 1990, another Ebola-Reston epidemic hit the same holding\nfacility.\n\n\nThat same year, it is now being revealed, a Texas facility run by the\nsame company had an outbreak among its monkeys.\n\n\nAgain, in March this year, Ebola-Reston was discovered in the Alice,\nTexas facility.\n\n\nThe monkeys were imported from the same source in the Philippines.\n\n\n \n\nBusinessman Alex Lina, who runs the Ferlite Farm in Laguna, said\nofficials from the U.S. Center for Disease Control ( CDC), the Naval Medical\nUnit of the U.S. Armed Forces and many other foreign scientists visited his\nfarm after the 1989 outbreak in Reston.\n\n\n \" We opened the facilities to them to do the testing\nand whatever else they feel is necessary, &rdquo;  he related to\n\"  Graphic  \" in an interview.\n\n\nBlood samples were taken of the monkeys and caretakers.\n\n\nAfter the researchers left, the Department of Health ordered him to\nkill off his entire stock, then numbering about 800.\n\n\n \" There was no epidemic raging in my farm at that time,\n&rdquo;  he said.\n\n\nBut he complied.\n\n\nHe cleaned out his farm and started again.\n\n\nExports resumed.\n\n\nLina complains that he was never furnished a copy of the research\nfindings. \n\n \n\nIn 1994, five full years after the Reston incident, the\ngovernment banned the export of wild monkeys.\n\n\nOnly those bred in captivity will be allowed out.\n\n\nExporters were assigned areas where they can collect monkeys to be\nused only as breeders. \n\n \n\nWith the most recent outbreak of Ebola-Reston infection in Texas\nnow reaching the press, the Philippines has banned temporarily all export of\nmonkeys.\n\n\nThere are six monkey exporting companies in the Philippines which\nsupply some 2,000-2,500 primates to laboratories abroad.\n\n\nThe ban was suggested by the country 's agricultural \nattache  in the U.S. \n\n\n  VIRUS SURVEILLANCE  \n\n \n\nSurveillance and monitoring of the disease is virtually nil in\nthe Philippines.\n\n\nIn 1995, DOH finally released a circular ( signed by then Acting\nSecretary Jaime Galvez-Tan) which announced what was already public knowledge\n- - that  \" Studies conducted by the Field Epidemiology Training\nProgram and Research Institute for Tropical Medicine of the Philippine\nDepartment of Health, U.S. CDC and U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for\nInfectious Diseases ( USAMRIID) among monkeys and animal handlers in the\nPhilippines and U.S. showed that the Reston strain does not cause illness\namong humans. &rdquo; \n\n\nApparently this referred to the 1989 study. \n\n \n\nDid anyone figure out how an Ebola virus ended up in a monkey\nfrom the Philippines?\n\n\nDr. Frederick A. Murphy, director of the U.S. Center for Infectious\nDiseases at the time of the Reston incident and one of the world authorities\non viruses, told a reporter of \" Access Excellence \" that\n \" It was not possible to do field studies in the Philippines\nbecause of a civil war going on in the area [ Mindanao] the monkeys came\nfrom. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" We still have no idea where Ebola lives in\nnature, &rdquo;  he added. \n\n \n\nThere is no indication that Filipino researchers, whether from\nthe DOH or from those concerned with the animal industry, went to Mindanao\nafter the Americans left to pursue vital research in the interest of the\ncountry 's own health and safety concerns.\n\n\nA government committee reportedly met once or twice shortly after\nthe 1989 scare and concluded that Ebola  \" was not of public\nhealth importance. &rdquo; \n\n\nOther sources said lack of foreign funds is the problem. \n\n \n\nThe Philippines, as far as exporter Lina knows, still does not\nhave the technical capability to test animals for Ebola. \n\n \n\nVeterinarian Arlene Vytiaco of the Bureau of Animal Industry (\nBAI) confirmed this but she relayed the news that the U.S. CDC was now\nwilling to help the country acquire Ebola testing kits or at least set up\nlinks so blood samples can be sent to the U. S. for testing. \n\n \n\nAnd finally, after seven years, the government formally created\nthis April a  \" multi-sectoral, filovirus study group, &rdquo;\n composed of experts from the DOH, DENR and DA.\n\n\nThe whole world is still largely in the dark about Ebola, said\nVytiaco, who will be part of the new study group.\n\n\nBut she agreed that vigilance is necessary. \n\n \n\n \" The worry is that the virus might mutate, we\nmust not relax, &rdquo;  she said in a telephone interview. \n\n \n\nA press release distributed by Ferlite cited a study in Japan 's\nTsukuba Primate Center for Medical Science, results of which were released\nJuly last year.\n\n\nThe study said that the non-virulent form of Ebola virus was also\nfound among monkeys from Indonesia and China. \n\n \n\nLina claims he has never experienced an epidemic in his farm\nduring his 15 years in the business.\n\n\nWhy Philippine monkeys do not die of Ebola fever here but do so in\nAmerica is curious.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ecd4531c-6fb1-42e7-82c8-1a0b3a4851a9", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.250503+00:00"}

Fernandez,\nAFSICH coordinator. \n\n \n\nThe endemic plants commonly listed under the \" \"\nvulnerable or potentially threatened species &rdquo; \" ( Category B)\nare   almaciga   ,   alde   ,\n  takobtob   ,   igem   ,\n  kalantas   ,   palasan   ,\n  lambio   ,   kamagong   ,\nand Mindanao cinnamon. \n\n \n\n \" Their populations are steadily being reduced\nbecause of continued destruction of wild stocks for commercial purposes,\n&rdquo;  Dr. Fernandez said. \n\n \n\nThe Philippine plants considered \" \" rare species\n&rdquo; \" ( Category C) are the   mono   ,\n  ungang   ,   lacaubi   ,\nand   katbalonga   .\n\n\nThese are \" rare &rdquo; because  \" their\npopulations have a highly restricted distribution or an extremely specialized\nhabitat, which may represent the last of its kind. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nFor all these endangered species, AFSICH recommends immediate and\nfull protection.\n\n\n \" The survival of endangered species depends heavily on\nthe conservation of their natural habitat, which is quickly disappearing,\n&rdquo;  says Dr. Fernandez. \n\n \n\n  Almaciga   ,   igem \n and   kalantas   are three of the 12 endemic\ntrees in the Philippines listed by the Convention on International Trade on\nEndangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna ( CITES) as facing extinction.\n\n\n \n\nCITES is an international organization aiming to protect\nimportant wildlife species against over exploitation and promote their\naesthetic, scientific, cultural, recreational, and economic values. \n\n \n\nThe nine other soon-to vanish tree species are  \nbatikuling   ,   dungon   ,  \nipil   ,   mangkono   ,  \nsangilo   ,   supa   ,  \ntindalo   ,   yakal-kaliot   , and\nMindoro pine. \n\n \n\nThe DENR cited excessive extraction of the trees as the reason\nfor their depletion.\n\n\nTake the case of   almaciga   , one of the\nmost expensive woods in the Philippines.\n\n\nPeople cut this tree for its commercial uses.\n\n\nIt is made into ruler, engineering equipment, general construction,\npanel boards, piano and guitar bodies, packaging dairy, and agricultural\nproducts. \n\n \n\nThe wood of   sangilo   is made into\njewelry boxes and other novelties.\n\n\nThe   supa   , on the other hand, is highly\nvalued in furniture, cabinet work, flooring, and tool handles. \n\n \n\nAside from trees, other endemic plants are also facing the same\nproblem.\n\n\nThis is particularly true to the rare ornamental plants. \n\n \n\n \" Many unscrupulous commercial plant collectors and\nsome garden fanciers here and abroad, blinded by greed, lust for profit or\nsheer personal satisfaction, are not bothered by the delicate existence of\nplants they collect from the wild, &rdquo;  Haribon laments. \n\n \n\nOne ornamental plant sought after by collectors is the \n waling-waling   , an orchid that used to abound on the\ntrunks of  dipterocarp  trees in Davao and Cotabato\nprovinces.\n\n\nNow, they are very rare in their natural habitats on account of\nexcessive logging of  dipterocarp  trees. \n\n \n\nIn an attempt to save, protect and regulate the trade of the\ncountry 's wild flowers and plants, the government passed Republic Act No.\n3983, which  \" prescribe conditions under which ( wild flowers\nand plants) may be collected, kept, sold, exported, and for other purposes.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nWhile the country is moving toward the conservation of its\nendemic plants, many environmentalists believe it is too slow. \n\n \n\n \" But with the full support of both the government\nand the public we can be optimistic that significant results can be achieved\nwithin the next decade or so, &rdquo;  says Haribon.\n\n\n\n \n\n \" Only when that stage is reached can the present\ngeneration and generations to come pause and breathe with relief that the\nbounties and richness of Philippine flora are still theirs to enjoy, &rdquo;\n it concludes.  \n\n\n\n\n  The  El Ni&ntidle;o  phenomenon \n\n\n\n Henrylito D. Tacio \n\n \n\n 'We can't determine yet when the  El Ni&ntilde;o\n phenomenon would be felt but it is expected this year, maybe later\nthis year,'  weather observer Lenny Ruiz told newsmen recently. \n\n \n\n \" El Ni&ntilde;o \"  , which\noccurs every two to seven years, is the quasi-periodic warming of the\nequatorial Pacific Ocean that can affect weather worldwide.\n\n\nThe name \"   El Ni&ntilde;o  \n\" , which means \" \" The Child &rdquo; \" in\nSpanish, was adopted by Peruvian fishermen who noticed that the warm water\nappeared around Christmas, when Christ Child was born. \n\n \n\n\"  Oilworld  \" , a Hamburg-based\nagricultural newsletter, has predicted an  El Ni&ntilde;o \nthis year.\n\n\nQuoting respected meteorologists, it reported that the Pacific Ocean\nis warming up abnormally and that in some parts, ocean temperatures were the\nhighest since August 1993. \n\n \n\n \" The waters off Peru 's northern coast are 15\ndegrees to 13 degrees Celsius above normal and rising, &rdquo; \nreports Ena Jaimes, chief meteorologist at Peru 's national weather service.\n\n\n \n\nIn 1982-1983, when the water temperatures peaked at 10 degrees\nCelsius above normal, a strong  El Ni&ntilde;o  ravaged\nthe country with heavy rains and flooding in the north, and a drought in the\nsouth. \n\n \n\nMeteorologists claimed the abnormal warming of the water\ntemperatures in the Pacific Ocean has increased the chances of drought in\nSoutheast Asia, particularly the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. \n\n \n\nIn the Philippines, the government has been urged to start\npreparing the agricultural sector for the resurgence of  El\nNi&ntilde;o  , which could threaten farm harvest in the months\nahead. \n\n \n\n Lakas  Rep. Jose Zubiri of Bukidnon warned that\nthis worldwide drought pattern could hurt the country 's economic growth in\nthe next 18 months.\n\n\nThe Philippines suffered its biggest economic loss from  El\nNi&ntilde;o  in 1990 to 1992, when &peso;4.1 billion in damage was\nrecorded, mostly in agriculture. \n\n \n\n \" Agricultural output accounts for 26 percent of\nour gross national product, &rdquo;  the farmer-turned-legislator\nsaid.\n\n\n \" If harvests are ruined, farm losses could bring the\nwhole economy down. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nIn anticipation, the Department of Agriculture has deployed one\ncloud-seeding plane in the Cagayan Valley region in the northeast and another\nin Mindanao.\n\n\nThe two regions in the eastern parts of the archipelago usually are\nthe most affected by  El Ni&ntilde;o  episodes. \n\n \n\nAgriculture Undersecretary Domingo Panganiban has also encouraged\nfarmers to plant corn and rice early to give the country at least two\ncropping seasons before early next year. \n\n \n\nMeanwhile, in Peru, the government has formed an emergency\ncommission for civil defense projects and public education in advance of the\n El Ni&ntilde;o  phenomenon.\n\n\n \" We 've established that there is a need for us to\ncreate a quick-response strategy ( to  El Ni&ntilde;o \neffects), &rdquo;  Health Minister Maximo Coasta Bauer told the\n\"  Associated Press  \" . \n\n \n\nScientists claim that the oceans, especially the Pacific, exert a\npowerful effect on world climate through the sheer mass transport of heat and\nthe evaporation of water.\n\n\nThe water vapor thus produced condenses to form storm clouds,\nreleasing latent heat into the atmosphere in the process. \n\n \n\nThis provides the atmosphere 's largest single heat source, and\nthe higher the ocean temperature in a given location, the greater the\nproduction of water vapor, clouds and atmospheric heat.\n\n\nThe climate system 's complex internal linkages, only partly\nunderstood by scientists, determine how the clouds and heat are distributed\naround the globe. \n\n \n\n El Ni&ntilde;o  starts when, through causes\nnot well understood by scientists, prevailing easterly winds slacken at the\nequator, allowing a broad but subtle wave of warm water from the western\nPacific to flow eastward toward South America. \n\n \n\nNo one knows precisely when  El Ni&ntilde;o \nfirst struck.\n\n\nHistorians are dating the phenomenon at least as far back as the\nearly 1500s, when the Spanish   conquistadores  \nentered South America amid raging storms.\n\n\nBut there are even records of terrible sweeping through pre-Columbian\ncommunities 400 years before that. \n\n \n\nUntil this century,  El Ni&ntilde;o  was\nbelieved to be a South American phenomenon, with no wider ramifications.\n\n\nBut recent scientific research has shown how a warming of the Pacific\ncan change the world 's weather patterns. \n\n \n\n \" There have been nine significant  El\nNi&ntilde;o  since World War II, &rdquo;  said Eugene M.\nRasmusson, a diagnostic expert for the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration ( NOAA) and a leading authority on the phenomenon. \n\n\n \" They occur on average every four or five years, but\nirregularly--they can be two years apart, or as many as 10. &rdquo; \n \n\n \n\nOne of the most significant  El Ni&ntilde;o \noccurrences happened in 1982-83.\n\n\n \" This Ni&ntilde;o was a maverick: It behaved\ndifferently from recent predecessors, &rdquo;  recalled Dr.\nRasmusson.\n\n\n  \" That 's one reason we didn't recognize it.\n\n\nAnother reason was a trick of nature.\n\n\nWhen it was first stirring in spring of 1982, the Mexican volcano\n El Chichon  belched an immense volume of dust into the\natmosphere.\n\n\nThe alien material misled our satellite sensors, thereby producing\nunreliable Pacific Ocean temperature readings. &rdquo;

{"text": "What you should know about dengue fever  \n\n\n  Government must realize the outbreak is serious, that\ninsecticides, fogging and antibiotics won't help  \n\n\n Dean Jorge Bocobo \n\n \n\nEPIDEMIC or not, it is time for the authorities and the public to\ntake the current outbreak of dengue fever seriously and to take appropriate\naction. \n\n \n\nThere are actually two types of dengue fever.\n\n\nThe first, which we may call \" \" classical dengue fever\n&rdquo; \" has been known for over 200 years, with the first reported\ncases arising in 1779 and 1780 from a simultaneous outbreak in Cairo, Egypt,\nJakarta, Indonesia and Philadelphia, USA. \n\n \n\nSince then, classical dengue has been reported in Asia, Africa and\nthe Americas with epidemics every 30 or 40 years.\n\n\nDespite severe symptoms of pain and fever, classical dengue was seldom\nfatal. \n\n \n\nBut in 1953-54, an epidemic broke out in the Philippines in which\na much more severe and potentially fatal form, \" \" dengue\nhemorrhagic fever &rdquo; \" was observed by E. N. Quintos and other\nhealth researchers here who reported their historic findings in the\nPhilippine Journal of Pediatrics ( Volume 3).\n\n\nDuring that epidemic, they observed a frightening and often fatal\nform of dengue fever in which many victims died from the shock that\naccompanied internal bleeding.\n\n\nThis form of dengue is accompanied by acute bleeding through the nose\nand in the gastrointestinal tract which can lead to dengue shock syndrome, a\nlife-threatening condition requiring immediate hospitalization and medical\ncare.\n\n\nThe effects and symptoms have been likened to that of  ebola\n in Africa. \n\n \n\nRecent news reports contain anecdotal evidence that the current\noutbreak of dengue in the Philippines has significant component of this more\nvirulent strain of the disease.\n\n\nThe US Center for Disease Control reports that there are up to 100\nmillion cases of dengue fever worldwide, mainly in the tropics, and several\nhundred thousand cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever. \n\n \n\nDengue is actually caused by four distinct strains of a virus, so\nthat persons living in epidemic areas can potentially come down with dengue\nfour times before acquiring immunity.\n\n\nThe virus is carried and transmitted by the   Aedes\nAegyptii   mosquito ( see accompanying illustration), which is\nknown to be a daytime feeder that prefers human blood.\n\n\nOnly the pregnant females bite, delivering a virus load present in\ntheir salivary glands.\n\n\nThe viruses themselves are exceedingly small ( much smaller than a\nmillionth of a meter) and can hijack the body 's cell machinery to breed and\nreproduce. \n\n \n\nThere is no vaccine or direct antiviral drug proven to be\neffective against classical or hemorrhagic dengue fever.\n\n\nFor the milder strain, supportive care such as bed rest and antifever\nmedications are normally enough.\n\n\nHowever, blood transfusions, supplemental oxygen and shock therapy\nare required for the more virulent strain. \n\n \n\nPast experience has shown that in countries such as the\nPhilippines, the peak of an epidemic has been reached or surpassed long\nbefore the authorities can declare its existence because there is no truly\neffective monitoring or reporting system.\n\n\nTherefore, the present situation may already be more serious than the\ngovernment claims it to be. \n\n \n\nMoreover, the standard approach of spraying or fogging with\ninsecticides may not be effective for several reasons.\n\n\nFirst, these are usually capable of killing off only the adult\nmosquito carriers, not their dormant eggs.\n\n\nWith the rains increasing, even the most persistent insecticide\nprograms may be insufficient to control the carriers which inherit the virus\nfrom their mothers through viral infection of their eggs.\n\n\nThe insects themselves are not affected by the viruses. \n\n \n\nSecond, insecticide control is progressively ineffective; just as\nin antibiotic overuse, insecticide programs only kill off the susceptible\nmosquitoes, leaving resistant varieties to dominate the overall population.\n\n\n \n\nTherefore, prevention and sanitation are essential to successful\ncontrol of the mosquito carriers.\n\n\nSince the females lay their eggs in water, the public should\neliminate all possible nesting sites, such as rubber tires and other\ncontainers of stagnant water in their neighborhoods and immediate\nsurroundings. \n\n \n\nChildren are most at risk so parents should take any flulike\nsymptoms seriously, especially those accompanied by high fever, and seek\nimmediate medical attention in such cases. \n\n \n\nBecause the principal carrier is a daytime feeder, schools must\ntake especial care to eliminate mosquito infestation.\n\n\nThe same applies to factories, churches and offices since adults can\nbe just as susceptible to the disease, depending on overall immune condition\nand genetic disposition. \n\n \n\nGovernment inaction is most deplorable.\n\n\nHowever, the public should not wait for its uncertain and\nundependable reaction to the warning signs.\n\n\nThe virus and its carrier may be exceedingly small creatures but the\ndamage of which they are capable certainly is not.  \n\n\n\n\n  Alternative sources of calcium for the lactose-intolerant\n \n\n\n Rowena C. Burgos \n\n \n\nMOST Filipinos consume very little milk ( traditionally a good\nsource of calcium), that is, one-fourth cup a day.\n\n\nThis is equivalent to only 340 milligrams of daily calcium intake,\njust 67 percent of the recommended dietary allowance ( RDA) of 600 mg, says a\nNational Nutrition Survey done a few years ago. \n\n \n\nDespite the emergence of many nutraceutical additives like\n ginseng  and bee pollen, calcium has remained one of the\nbest around. \n\n \n\nIn the human body, which consists of about two percent calcium by\nweight, about 99 percent of this calcium occurs in the bones and teeth and\nthe remainder in body cells and fluids.\n\n\nThis remainder is essential to muscle contraction and hence to\ncardiac function, transmission of nerve impulses and in blood coagulation.\n\n\n \n\nParathyroid and thyroid hormones help maintain proper calcium\nbalance in the tissues.\n\n\nWithout enough calcium, the body searches for another source of\ncalcium - - the bones in a process called calcium cannibalism.\n\n\nIt can impair growth and lead to such conditions as rickets, tetany\nand osteoporosis. \n\n \n\nLow-fat milk and dairy products, water,  tofu \n, leafy green vegetables and fermented fish are sources of dietary calcium.\n\n\nBut for some adults and even infants, milk and other dairy products\ncause a discomfort known as lactose intolerance.\n\n\nOthers worry about the high-calorie content of such products.\n\n\nStill others are simply allergic to these food supplements. \n\n \n\nBut we may soon be able to enjoy calcium-fortified ice cream,\ncookies, pies, juices and even coffee through a new calcium treatment process\nunveiled recently in the United States. \n\n \n\nThis new treatment process enables calcium to be soluble in low\nviscosity liquids and stabilized in high-acid products.\n\n\nThis could lead to food processors being able to add nutritionally\nsignificant levels of calcium to ice cream, cookies, pie fillings, powdered\ncheese mixes, coffee creamers and liquid nutrition products. \n\n \n\nThe new method combines calcium salts with milk or soy proteins\nand then spray dried.\n\n\nThe outcome is a combination of high-calcium proteins, which when put\nback into water, results in calcium being suspended.\n\n\nThe process uses calcium carbonate which makes it inexpensive and\npractical to add enough of the said mineral in a wide array of food. \n\n \n\nOne of the biggest potential applications for the new method is\nliquid nutrition supplements.\n\n\nNutritionists are looking at giving consumers more calcium-fortified\nliquid products such as juices to provide an alternative to traditionally\ncalcium-enriched milk products. \n\n \n\nOne of them is the Philippine Health Food Center, Inc. (\nPhilHealth) which recently introduced Calciumade, the first high-calcium\ndrink in the country which comes in a refreshing natural orange flavor. \n\n \n\nAvailable in powder form, a glass of Calciumade is equivalent to\n300 mg of calcium, the same amount supplied by a glass of milk.\n\n\nTwo glasses of Calciumade provides the Philippine RDA for calcium.\n\n\n \n\n \" Milk is still the best source of calcium but\nsince there are people who cannot tolerate it, Calciumade, a little on the\nacid side, would be a good alternative.\n\n\nSeven to nine servings of broccoli a day which is equivalent to three\nto four glasses of milk is also a very good source of calcium but broccoli is\ntoo expensive,\"  said Dr. Imelda Ayaso-Sapalo, director of the\nmedical affairs division of United Laboratories, Inc. during the product\nlaunch of Calciumade. \n\n \n\n \" Calcium tablets can also be taken but they have a\nbitter after-taste.\n\n\nUnlike Calciumade which is delicious, easy on the stomach, light and\nlactose-free, it also contains Vitamins A, B, C and E, Niacin, Pantholenic\nAcid, Phosphorus and Magnesium, &rdquo;  added Stephanie Co, product\nmanager of PhilHealth. \n\n \n\nCalcium is the essential mineral that builds bones and keeps them\nhealthy and strong.\n\n\nBones constantly undergo remodeling, says Dr. Sapalo, at a rate of 50\npercent a year in young children and five percent a year in adults. \n\n \n\n \" Bone takes a lot of stress so it has to be\nremodeled.\n\n\nBone resorption is followed by bone formation.\n\n\nFor this to take place, calcium intake is very important.\n\n\nThe phase in remodeling becomes abnormal once it results in bone\nfracture,\"  explained Dr. Sapalo. \n\n \n\nResearch reveals that in aging men and women, especially\npost-menopausal females, calcium absorption and bone formation is reduced and\nrapid bone loss of 15 percent in five years occurs.\n\n\nOsteoporosis, the thinning and weakening of bones, results from lack\nof calcium.\n\n\nIts prevalence rate is 21 percent among Asians and Caucasians; 16% in\nHispanics; and 10% in African-Americans who have higher bone mass than Asians\nand Caucasians. \n\n \n\nWomen are more likely to develop this bone disorder because they\nhave less bone tissue and lose bone more rapidly than men due to the changes\ninvolved in menopause. \n\n \n\nAside from not enough calcium intake, aging, female menopause,\nwhite/Asian ancestry, small-boned or petite form, the other risk factors for\nosteoporosis are family history of osteoporosis, certain diseases and\nmedications like anticonvulsants and thyroid medication, caffeine, smoking, a\ndiet heavy in salt, animal protein or fiber, alcohol, carbonated beverages,\ninadequate or excessive exercise resulting in cessation of menstruation and\nemotional stress.  \n\n\n\n\n  Artificial coral reef - a new home for marine life \n\n\n\n Ronald M. Henson \n\n \n\nIF THE natural runs out, try artificial means! \n\n \n\nThis is the moral of the story behind Project SOMAL ( Save Our\nMarine Life) located in Aplaya, Digos, Davao del Sur where young\nstudent-environmentalists rehabilitated the damaged sea corals using the\ntwig-like spadices from the coconut that serve as the new sanctuary for the\nmarine life. \n\n \n\nThe major problem of coral reefs in this country is caused by the\npressure of human population.\n\n\nThere are just too many fishermen who overfish the seas, and stress\nthe coral reef ecosystem.\n\n\nEven during low tide, the gleaners composed of men, women and\nchildren comb the area for edible and marketable marine products.\n\n\nAs a result, the reef flats rapidly become less diverse, less\nproductive and plundered. \n\n \n\nIn view of these, what management measures can be recommended to\nrestore our corals?\n\n\nOne way to save our reefs is to limit access to them.\n\n\nBut this will be one mean task.\n\n\nAnother move is to establish marine parks and reserves, however, they\ncan only serve as limited replenishment areas for marine organisms. \n\n \n\nCognizant of this situation, the first year students of Davao del\nSur National High School ( DDSNHS) have come to the rescue.\n\n\nThey bundled the coconut spadices which are the fleshy spikes in a\nleaflike structure of the coconut tree that are brownish in color, tied them\nto stones as sinkers and dropped in the sea to serve as substitute for coral\nreefs.\n\n\nThe first dropping was done in September 1994, some 500 meters away\nfrom the shoreline, at 12 feet deep during low tide.\n\n\nWith continuous droppings of bundles of spadices, fishers found a new\n \" home where they can lay eggs, hatch and shelter the young, or\neven collect their food from the artificial reef. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nFor the success of Project SOMAL which is benefitting the people\nof the entire province of Davao del Sur, President Fidel V. Ramos awarded the\nstudents and advisers of DDSNHS the Grand Prize for the 2nd 1995 \nGawad  AGKATEK, a yearly search-competition sponsored by the Science\nEducation Institute ( SEI) of the Department of Science and Technology (\nDOST). \n\n \n\nThe DDSNHS Science Club sought the assistance of the officials of\n Nagkahiusang Mangingisda sa Katawhan  ( NAMANGKA), and the\npersonnel of the Aquatic Services Development Economic Council ( ASDEC) in\nputting up the project.\n\n\nBut at first, NAMANGKA and ASDEC were hesitant to do the project\nbased on the past experience of using spare tires for artificial reefs which\nnever worked at all. \n\n \n\nWith persistence and zeal, the young students who showed concern\nover the endangered marine ecosystem finally convinced the government and the\nnon-government agency to launch Project SOMAL.\n\n\nOn July 30, 1994, a one-day seminar was held by the ASDEC staff for\nthe students ' awareness of the protection and preservation of the marine\nlife. \n\n \n\nThus, Project SOMAL came into existence with the following\nobjectives: 1) to restore the habitat of the marine fishes using the coconut\nspadices as artificial coral reef, 2) to help small fishermen increase their\nincome when more fishes abound along the coastal communities of Digos, Davao\ndel Sur, and 3) to promote awareness of marine protection and conservation\namong the youth. \n\n \n\nThe making of an artificial \" home &rdquo; for the fishes\nis in low cost.\n\n\nThe spadices are collected free, then bundled using a nylon and tied\nto stones serving as sinkers.\n\n\nA truck is needed to haul the spadices and stones.\n\n\nThe fishermen of NAMANGKA helped a great deal in dropping the\nspadice-bundles into the sea, and in keeping a vigilant watch of the\noperation of the project. \n\n \n\nThe procedures from collection of spadices to dropping of the\nbundles are simple.\n\n\nHere 's how a community can go into artificial coral reefing:\n\n\n1. Collect the spadices, assign a quota to a community in order to\nmaximize collection of spadices.\n\n\n2. Gather the stones of 2-3 kgs. each.\n\n\n3. Make the bundles, about 3-4 are tied tightly together by a nylon\nto make a bundle.\n\n\n4. Make the sinkers by placing the stones in the nylon baskets and\ntying at the bottom of the bundles.\n\n\n5. Drop the bundles of spadices 500 meters away from the shoreline,\nat 12 feet deep, the bundles must be five meters far apart from each other.\n\n\n6. Keep watch and safeguard the artificial reef.\n\n\n7. Add bundles of spadices at least yearly to have a continuous\nstock of artificial coral reef for the marine life. \n\n \n\nAfter 11 months, some favorable results were observed by the\nDavao fishermen and divers--more fish supply, more fish eggs have been laid\nfor the future, and a safer nursery and habitat for fishes and other marine\norganisms. \n\n \n\nThe environment-consciousness efforts extended by the NAMANGKA,\nASDEC, BFAR,  barangay  and school officials are indeed\ncommendable.\n\n\nAnd the young science clubbers ' efforts at the restoration of this\nsea habitat which had been damaged by man 's reckless disregard of nature is\na badge of courage. \n\n \n\nNow, if you go to the project site, you can see thousands and\nthousands of fingerlings inhabiting the SOMAL artificial coral reef, an\nindication that the fishes happily thrive in a newly-found home.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "7860a090-ec39-40a1-afa7-aa6a030cdf0a", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.252862+00:00"}
{"text": "More and more Filipinas resorting to hormone therapy\n \n\n\n  Debate surrounds management of menopause  \n\n\n Vangie S. Baga \n\n \n\nAT 52, Sunshine ( not her real name) started experiencing hot\nflushes, sleepless nights and dizziness.\n\n\nHer monthly period stopped. \n\n \n\nThe mother of four was entering menopause. \n\n \n\nOther symptoms of the life phase also started consuming\nher--irritability, nausea and anxiety. \n\n \n\nAlarmed that her condition would worsen, Sunshine, a\nbusinesswoman, asked her obstetrician-gynecologist to relieve her of the\nuneasiness and discomfort.\n\n\nThe doctor recommended the hormone replacement therapy ( HRT).\n\n\nSunshine was given a good dosage of Premarin, an oral medication\nwhich is an adequate source of estrogen. \n\n \n\nIn three months, Sunshine was back to her normal self. \n\n \n\n \" I can sleep well, I have no more hot flushes and\nno more sweating at night, &rdquo;  says Sunshine.\n\n\nAlthough she continues to take the medicine on her doctor 's advice,\nshe is no longer worried about her body 's future. \n\n \n\n\" \" Oh No, It 's Johnny! &rdquo; \"\nproducer Roselle Rebano, 49, started missing her menstrual period in early\n1996; it stopped entirely in April that year.\n\n\nLike Sunshine, she has one-minute hot flushes which recur after two\nto three hours, mood swings and sometimes, depression. \n\n \n\n \" I feel I 'm not normal, &rdquo; \ncomplains Rebano, who has three children.\n\n\nTo make the people around her understand what she 's going through,\n \" I announced to everyone in the office that I 'm menopausal.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nRebano has heard of the various health risks menopause brings,\nsuch as heart disease and osteoporosis, a disease of the bones.\n\n\nShe has consulted her OB-Gyne who also advised her to undergo HRT.\n\n\n\n  Controversy  \n\n \n\nHowever, Rebano has also learned about the side effects of HRT.\n\n\nShe 's now in a dilemma--to go through HRT or not. \n\n \n\nHormone replacement therapy confuses many women today.\n\n\nIt also confounds most doctors. \n\n \n\nHRT has been in the Philippines for more than two decades now.\n\n\nIn the United States, many postmenopausal women are into HRT. \n\n \n\nHRT, however, has been bombarded with controversies about its\nside effects.\n\n\nWhen not properly defined and administered, it could cost a woman her\nlife. \n\n \n\nHRT used to be called estrogen replacement therapy ( ERT).\n\n\nEstrogen is the basic hormone that becomes deficient when a woman\nbecomes menopausal.\n\n\nThe moment a woman is estrogen deficient, she develops a lot of\nphysical and psychological problems. \n\n \n\nIn women, the loss of estrogen manifests itself through acute and\nlong-term symptoms.\n\n\nAbout 75 percent of women experience acute menopausal symptoms like\nhot flushes, headaches, sleepless nights, strange skin sensations, and\npalpitations.\n\n\nFor some women, these symptoms are insignificant.\n\n\nFor others, they are manageable.\n\n\nBut for many, they make life miserable. \n\n \n\nA hot flush brings a feeling of intense heat that envelops the\nbody, usually from the waist up and especially the face and neck.\n\n\nThe blood vessels on the skin 's surface dilate, causing a rosy\nflush.\n\n\nIn most cases the flush is accompanied by profuse perspiration.\n\n\nA hot flush is often sensed a few seconds before it occurs. \n\n \n\nPsychoneurologic symptoms, such as panic attacks, mood swings,\nanxiety, irritability, poor memory, and poor concentration increase after\nmenopause.\n\n\nEstrogen-deficiency in postmenopausal women may also contribute to\nthe degeneration of the central nervous system. \n\n \n\nAfter a few years, more symptoms appear.\n\n\nWomen suffer what is known as urogenital atrophy, which causes\ndifficulty in urination, dryness of the vagina which makes intercourse\npainful, and loss of libido. \n\n \n\nOther changes include breast tenderness, abdominal bloating, and\nleg cramps. \n\n \n\nThe long-term effects are more life-threatening.\n\n\nLoss of natural estrogens during menopause puts women at increased\nrisk of cardiovascular disease, the most common cause of death worldwide\namong postmenopausal women.\n\n\nOther dangers are osteoporosis and Alzheimer 's disease. \n\n\n  Hormone replacement  \n\n \n\nToday, ERT is called HRT because there are two hormones involved\nin the therapy--estrogen and progesterone. \n\n \n\n \" Doctors have realized that some women need not\nonly estrogen but progesterone as well, &rdquo;  says Dr. Delfin A.\nTan, president of the United Doctors Medical Center and a fellow of the\nPhilippine Obstetrical and Gynecological Society. \n\n \n\n \" Basically, women who still have their uterus\nintact will need both estrogen and progesterone,\"  he adds.\n\n\n \" Those who have their uterus removed, for one reason\nor another, don't need progesterone anymore. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nHRT is supposed to help women delay all the possible risks of\nmenopause.\n\n\nHRT restores estrogen levels in the body. \n\n \n\nMenopause occurs between the 40s and 50s.\n\n\nThe youngest menopausal women could be less than 30 years old.\n\n\nDr. Tan had a 26-year-old menopausal patient, but it 's a very rare\ncase.\n\n\nThe oldest he 's known was 57. \n\n \n\nMenopause marks a woman 's last menstrual flow.\n\n\n \" Before you say a woman is menopausal she should have\nmissed her period for at least one year,\"  says Dr. Tan.\n\n\n \" But let 's say you had your menstruation thrice a\nyear, that 's not menopause. &rdquo;  \n\n\n  Safe?  \n\n \n\nHormone therapy can take the form of <unclear> .... </unclear>\nskin patches, or injections.\n\n\nThe most common form is oral.\n\n\nTablets and capsules are widely available in drugstores, and they 're\nmore popular because they 're convenient and said to be more effective. \n\n \n\nThere have been heated arguments, here and abroad, about the\neffectivity and side effects of HRT.\n\n\nStudies have shown that menopausal women who take hormones could have\nhigher risk of breast cancer and endometrial cancer, which strikes the lining\nof the uterus. \n\n \n\n \" The influence of hormone therapy on breast cancer\nrisk is uncertain despite numerous studies, &rdquo;  says Dr. Tan.\n\n\n \" There 's still no agreement on the effect of HRT on\nrisk of breast cancer.\n\n\nRecent evidence indicates no substantial increase in breast cancer\nrisk for women who take estrogen in the recommended doses. &rdquo; \n\n\n \n\n \" The issue has not been settled.\n\n\nIf there are side effects these are very slight.\n\n\nBut the benefits you get from these hormones will be much more than\nthe possible side effects. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nBesides, he adds, women can develop breast cancer even when they 're\nnot taking estrogen. \n\n \n\nBut Tan notes that taking estrogen for a long period of time may\nactually lead to endometrial cancer.\n\n\nTo avert this, doctors prescribe progesterone. \n\n \n\n \" You can develop endometrial cancer whether you\ntake estrogen or not, &rdquo;  he stresses.\n\n\n \" Taking estrogen correctly combined with progesterone,\nthe second major female hormone--will not increase your chances of uterine\ncancer and actually protect you from it. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nEstrogen and progesterone won't harm women.\n\n\nIn fact, they can dramatically improve quality of life.\n\n\nThey can add years to life and well-being to the body. \n\n \n\n \" If your uterus is intact, you need estrogen as\nwell as progesterone, &rdquo;  Tan says.\n\n\n \" But if you don't have a uterus anymore, you don't\nneed progesterone. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThe benefits far outweigh the risks of hormone therapy, according\nto the doctor.\n\n\n  \" Wala namang buhay sa mundo na walang risks,\n&rdquo;   he says. \n\n \n\nUnlike estrogen which should be taken everyday, progesterone is\ngiven cyclically, say 10 days a month. \n\n \n\nSome problems, like bleeding, can develop.\n\n\n \" But bleeding generally disappears when you continue\nthe medication. &rdquo;  \n\n\n  Quality of life  \n\n \n\nThe fact that estrogen therapy is safe should not send every\nmenopausal woman to her doctor and ask for it.\n\n\nMany women don't need it, and some won't take it even if they need\nit.\n\n\nMany women can manage without it.\n\n\nSome require only a short-term help from estrogen, just enough for\ntheir bodies to adjust to the changes in hormone levels that occur during\nmenopause. \n\n \n\nIn the case of Sunshine, she was advised to continue taking the\nhormones.\n\n\n \" What we are preparing for are the late complications\nlike osteoporosis and heart ailments, &rdquo;  explains Tan.\n\n\n \" Osteoporosis is a serious problem.\n\n\nIt 's a silent disease.\n\n\nIt can strike anytime, even when you don't feel anything.\n\n\nHRT should be applied for prevention. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nTan is a member of the Philippine Society of Climacteric\nMedicine ( \" climacteric \" is a synonym for \"\nmenopause \" ) .\n\n\nOther society members are cardiologists, surgeons, psychiatrists,\nrheumatologists, and physical therapists, among others.\n\n\nFormed in 1992, it aims to study menopause in men and women,\ndisseminate knowledge and information about menopause, coordinate research\nabout menopause in the Philippines. \n\n \n\n \" The Philippines started late as far as menopause\nis concerned, &rdquo;  says Tan.\n\n\nIn general, Asian countries are a little late in understanding the\nproblems of menopause, compared with Western and European countries. \n\n \n\nOrientals are not as dramatic as Westerners in reacting to\nmenopause.\n\n\n \" Why would you complain when a bigger problem is how\nto earn enough money to buy three square meals a day, &rdquo;  notes\nTan. \n\n \n\nOften, the people most concerned about menopause are those in\nthe A and B classes. \n\n \n\nThe hormone dosages given to menopausal women vary.\n\n\nSome women need more, some less.\n\n\nBut the standard estrogen brand and dosage used is Premarin at 0.625\nmg. daily. \n\n\n  Expensive  \n\n \n\nHRT is expensive.\n\n\nOne bottle of 100 tablets of Premarin can cost from &peso;1,000 to\n&peso;1,200.\n\n\nIt is taken once a day, 365 days a year. \n\n \n\n \" Remember, a menopausal woman is\nestrogen-deficient for the rest of her life, &rdquo;  says Tan.\n\n\n \" HRT is very popular these days, but not everybody\ncan afford it. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nFortunately, HRT is not the only cure for postmenopausal women.\n\n\nIt 's just part of postmenopausal management. \n\n \n\n \" When you have a baby, you bring the baby to a\ndoctor for vaccinations and regular check-up to keep the baby healthy,\n&rdquo;  Tan explains in illustration.\n\n\n \" When you 're pregnant, you go to a doctor for\nprenatal care even if you 're not sick.\n\n\nSo, why shouldn't postmenopausal woman get treatment? &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\nMenopausal women, whether or not they 're into HRT, should visit\ntheir doctors at least once a year for regular check-ups or tests like pap\nsmear, pelvic ultrasound and mammography.\n\n\nA pap smear will show if anything is wrong with the cervix.\n\n\nA pelvic ultrasound will reveal the condition of the endometrium.\n\n\nMammography helps detect developing breast lumps. \n\n \n\n \" This is a process of education, &rdquo;

 he adds.\n\n\n \" But it affects their way of thinking and their\npractice.\n\n\nTo some extent, we have educated a good majority of gynecologists.\n\n\nMany of them are now willing to practice HRT. &rdquo;

{"text": "Are we losing our rainforest treasures?  \n\n\n Doris Gaskell Nuyda \n\n \n\nWE cannot say we 're not being warned.\n\n\nHow often have we been told that many of our wildlife face extinction,\nand if we don't do something about it, we humans will be in a precarious\nposition. \n\n \n\nEnvironmentalists are no longer content addressing people about\nthe need to conserve our natural resources.\n\n\nThey are now writing books and more books with photos of what could\nhappen, what we would lose, if we didn't stop logging illegally; stop\npoaching in our forest and marine preserves; if we continued to mine and\nquarry without thinking about tomorrow. \n\n \n\nThe latest warning comes from the book, \" \"\nVanishing Treasures of the Philippine Rain Forest &rdquo; \" by\nLawrence R. Reaney and Jacinto C. Regalado Jr., and published by the Field\nMuseum, Chicago. \n\n\n  Great biodiversity  \n\n \n\nThe book presents problems by first showing the great biodiversity\nin the Philippines.\n\n\nIt is the greatest in the world, considering the country 's size and\nthe fact that our rainforest wildlife can be found nowhere else in the world.\n\n\nFrom that premise, the book goes on to show that to lose any of that\ndiversity would be tragic, especially since it need not happen at all. \n\n \n\nThe book explains how this biodiversity came to be: \n\" . ...more than 50 million years ago, the islands arose as volcanoes\nfrom the depths of the Pacific Ocean... \n\n\nSlowly drifting closer and gradually increasing in size, the\nPhilippine archipelago has been and remains one of the most geologically\nactive places on the planet.\n\n\nAt least 17 of its volcanoes are now active and dozens of others are\nconsidered inactive. ..\n\n\n. As a result of this volcanic history, the Philippines is one of\nthe most fertile and mountainous countries in the world. &rdquo; \n \n\n \n\nIts geological isolation and gradual approach to the Asian\nmainland have had an enormous impact on the country 's biological diversity,\naccording to Heaney and Regalado.\n\n\nThey believe also that while birds, bats, butterflies and other\nflying animals were able to make the difficult journey across the seas, such\ntravel did not happen often. \n\n \n\nToday, 172 out of 395 ( 44 percent) of land birds seen in the\nPhilippines are found only here.\n\n\nAmong Philippine mammals that cannot fly, 85 or 86 percent out of\n101, live only in the Philippines. \n\n \n\nThe Philippines ' rich biodiversity, say the authors, is largely\nthe result of our climate which grows from hot in the lowlands to cool up in\nthe mountains, and brings on the annual typhoon.\n\n\nThe climate is also responsible for  \" shaping the\nrestricted types of habitats that originally occurred in the Philippines.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThe authors inform us that the Philippines is almost on equal\nfooting with Brazil which is 28 times larger and whose rainforests are move\nextensive, as are other places with interesting endemic  fauna\n but with less to show despite their size. \n\n \n\nStudies by the authors show that at the time Southeast Asia was\nbeginning to take shape five million years ago, the Philippines, at least the\nhighlands of northern Luzon, were already well-established. \n\n \n\nThe land mass that is now the Philippines was formed during the\nIce Age when islands progressively emerged, and merged, which explains why\nplants and animals found in one end of the country are present in the other\nend, but with entirely different species in the areas between. \n\n \n\nThe first part of the book describes the Philippine rainforest so\nvividly we are almost transported to another world.\n\n\nThe pictures the authors paint in both words and images communicate\nthe message. \n\n\n  Five habitats  \n\n \n\nReaney and Regalado enumerate five kinds of habitats in the\nforest.\n\n\nOne is the forest on top of mountains, like Mt. Kitanglad in\nMindanao, where the temperature is cool and rainfall so high, plants grow in\nthick profusion.\n\n\nThere is where we find the most number of unique species. \n\n \n\nThere is the pine forest, far from the sea but near other\nmountains.\n\n\nThese regions are home not only to the world-famous Banawe Rice\nTerraces but also to birds familiar to northerners--crossbills and\nbullfinches--and to a rodent called the Luzon bushytailed cloud rat. \n\n \n\nThere is the mangrove forest, crucial breeding habitats for many\nspecies of marine fish and shore birds. \n\n \n\nLimestone forests have a low diversity of plant life, but the\nplants that do grow in them like the  molave  tree, tend to be\nhighly restricted, unique species that provide habitat for unique butterflies\nand other insects. \n\n \n\nThen there is the ultrabasic or serpentine type of forests\ncharacterized by rocky terrain.\n\n\nThey thus support only a few species of plant life, but many of them\nrestricted to the Philippines.  \n\n \n\n \" Diversity in the Philippines is therefore\ndetermined not just geographically but also climatically within each island.\n\n\nIt is [ this] combination. ...that has led to the profusion of life\nin the Philippines, not of large numbers of species residing in a single\nhabitat, but of sets of species unique to a great number of small areas of\nhabitat. &rdquo;   \n\n \n\nCopies of the book will be available at the  Talakayan\n on \"  \" Asukal Para Sa Mahirap, Sa Presyo\nAbot-kaya ng Mamimili &rdquo;  \" at Sofitel, Roxas Boulevard\non Oct. 14, 9 a. m. - 12 nn.\n\n\nThe affair will be sponsored by the Philippine Food Multi-Purpose\nCooperative ( Food Coop).  \n\n\n\n\n  Potassium Bromate in Bread  \n\n\n Ethel Soliven T. \n\n \n\nIf this sounds \" \" Greek &rdquo; \" to you,\nno need to fret - - you are one of millions of Filipinos who are slowly being\npoisoned by the bread we eat.\n\n\nAccording to one concerned citizen, Donnie Lopez, of Diliman, Quezon\nCity,  \" this toxic chemical has been mixed with our flour since\n1900 when we started using wheat flour in our country and has now grown into\na multi-million peso industry. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nLopez adds that a warning had been issued by the Food and\nAgriculture Organization ( FAO) and World Health Organization ( WHO) \n\" that this chemical can cause cancer. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nLopez pressed for a ban on the toxic additive to be imposed by\nthe Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) and had written to Dr. Quintin\nKintanar, director of the Bureau of Food and Drugs ( BFAD), regarding the\nmatter. \n\n \n\nDr. Kintanar informed Lopez of Administrative Order No. 25 issued\nin 1996 \" \" Setting the deadline for the Phase-Out of Potassium\nBromate as Flour Treatment Agent to End September 30, 1996. &rdquo;\n\"\n\n\nAlas, an error delayed implementation of the \" phase-out.\n&rdquo; \n\n \n\nContrary to regulations under the Consumers Act, Administrative\nOrder No. 25 was published in only one newspaper of general circulation\ninstead of the prescribed two newspapers. \n\n \n\nFor some inexplicable reason, it took Director Kintanar almost\ntwo years to correct the \" error &rdquo; and have AO No. 25 published\nin two newspapers only last April 1998.\n\n\nThe consequence of the delay was that potassium bromate continued to\nbe used as an additive agent in flour for baking bread. \n\n \n\nAccording to Lopez who describes himself as a \" \"\nlone crusader on the ban on potassium bromate, &rdquo; \" Kintanar 's\ndirective continues to be ignored. \n\n \n\nAgain, upon the urging of Lopez, then Health Secretary Felipe\nEstrella issued on July 31, 1998, Department Circular No. 55 for the\ncontinued ban of the toxic chemical.\n\n\nEstrella blamed non-compliance on Kintanar 's failure  \"\nto launch an unscheduled inspection of those companies given a \" CDO\n&rdquo; ( cease and desist order) and cancel of their permit to operate if\nproven that anyone of them have violated the ban for the 2nd time around.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nLopez cites Kintanar for insisting to media that potassium\nbromate can be considered safe for the millions of people involved in\nprocessing this toxic chemical, are directly inhaling the powder and the\npossibility of developing cancer is of great risk. \n\n \n\nFortunately, Lopez found a sympathetic ear in Senator Juan M.\nFlavier who filed Resolution No. 118 on August 13, 1998, calling for a senate\ninvestigation  \" to determine the reason why the DOH failed in\ntotally stopping the use of potassium bromate. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nSenator Flavier, who was health secretary during the Ramos\nadministration, underscores the fact that the ban should have been in force\nfor almost five years now since the DOH had banned the said products in the\nPhilippines in 1994. \n\n \n\nPerhaps Director Kintanar shall enlighten the senate committee on\nhealth on  \" the reason why the DOH failed in totally stopping\nthe use of potassium bromate. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThe consuming public has a right to know and to be protected.\n\n\nEven if one didn't eat bread, we are exposed to all sorts of\ncarcinogenic agents - - from the air we breathe, the water we drink, the\nbombardment of ultra-violet rays of the sun, even the pouring \" acid\nrain, &rdquo; the  e. coli  in fresh meats and fish, the\nfruits and vegetables fattened under clouds of insecticides, pesticides, etc.\n\n\n \n\nWe shouldn't have to worry also about the bread we eat.  \n\n\n\n  Everything you need to know about water  \n\n\n Tina Aboitiz Juan \n\n \n\nSOMEONE once said that human beings are just  \"\nhairy bags of water that can move. &rdquo;

{"text": "Fabled Pasig River gasps for dear life  \n\n\n By HENRYLITO D. TACIO \n\n  \n\n \n\nIn the past, the Pasig River was one of the most captivating\ntributaries to watch.\n\n\nIn fact, it was once touted as \" \" the Venice of the\nEast. &rdquo; \"\n\n\nThe river was so beguiling that it captivated the heart of Dr. Jose\nRizal.\n\n\nIn his European travelogue in 1886, he thought of Pasig River while\ncruising along the Rhine. \n\n \n\n \" The Rhine is beautiful, &rdquo;  he wrote,\n \" it reminds one of the Pasig of my native land, and proudly I\nthink that if the Pasig had on its banks more beautiful buildings, it would\nonly envy the Rhine for its long course and abundant waters. &rdquo; \n\n\n \n\nParadoxically, it was the country 's foremost hero who was the\nfirst one to document the first stages of the river 's despoliation.\n\n\nUpon his return in Manila in 1887, he noted:  \n\n \n\nRizal did not live long to shower the river with more of his\nverses.\n\n\nWhile it has been the subject of poets before, the Pasig is now the\nobject of environmentalists ' apprehension. \n\n \n\nA study conducted by the Danish International Development Agency\n( Danida) found the historic river dead - biologically.\n\n\nUnless drastic rehabilitation is done, the river will vanish like the\nextinct   esteros   and tributaries that once\nbranched out of it, the study concluded. \n\n \n\nToo much sludge and pollution have made organic life impossible\nin the Pasig River.\n\n\nThe Danida study found dissolved oxygen ( DO) to be only one\nmilligram per liter in some parts of the river, even plummeting to zero at\ncertain points. \n\n \n\nThe biochemical oxygen demand ( BOD) - the oxygen in the water\nrequired by aerobic bacteria to dissolve all organic matter thrown in the\nriver - is measured at 350 tons.\n\n\nBut the virtual absence of oxygen in the Pasig River makes it\nimpossible for the aerobic bacteria to dissolve the debris thrown in the\nriver. \n\n \n\n \" This oxygen deficiency is the main cause of the\noffensive odor and the absence of biological life in the river,\" \nobserve one Filipino environmentalist. \n\n \n\nThe Pasig River lies between two huge bodies of water, the Laguna\nLake on the southeast and the Manila Bay on the northwestern end.\n\n\nIt oscillates from lake to bay with the ebb and flow of the tide.\n\n\nSince Manila is known to have a mixed tide, the Pasig flows twice\ndaily towards the direction of the bay and the same number of times towards\nthe opposite direction. \n\n \n\nThe word \"   pasig   \"\nliterally means \" \" riverside. &rdquo; \"\n\n\nThis redundance of the name Pasig River came from folklore.\n\n\nOld folks say an officer, standing at a river had asked one of the\nnatives that name of the place.\n\n\nThe native logically said it was \" \" Pasig &rdquo;\n\" ( shortened form of \"   dalampasigan \n \" ) .\n\n\nObviously, what he really meant was that the man was standing on the\nriverside.\n\n\nHenceforth, it was called \"   Rio de Pasig \n \" in explorers ' maps. \n\n \n\nStretching 25 kilometers from Manila Bay in the west to Laguna de\nBay in the east, the Pasig River and its tributaries provided a viable mode\nof inland transportation to the early settlers of Manila.\n\n\nAt the height of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon trade, the mouth of the\nriver served as a veritable transport point of goods coming from the Middle\nEast and other Asian countries. \n\n \n\nTales were told of the river teeming with life and blessing the\nriver folk with freshwater bounties, and clean, fresh water. \n\n \n\n \" The river showed off its bounty around the 1940s\nwhen, being relatively unpolluted, it generously flowed for people to wash\nclothes and take a bath in, for poets to admire, and for fishermen to take\nhome a bountiful catch, &rdquo; recalled Dr. Macrina ZafaralIa in her study\n\"  Pasig: The Ecology of a Dying River  \" . \n\n  \n\n \n\nThis was in the past.\n\n\nAs Manila developed with the imperatives of urbanization, industrial\nestablishments conveniently mushroomed along both sides of the fabled river.\n\n\nSubsequent events tell of the usual path taken by all rivers that\nhave witnessed the growth of great cities adjacent to them. \n\n \n\n \" With time, the river became an overused artery of\ncommercial and industrial pursuits,\"  Dr. Zafaralla noted in her\nstudy. \n\n\n \" In the 1960s, the water shimmered in oily squalor.\n\n\nThereafter, water from artesian wells dug along the banks became\nunpotable for human consumption.\n\n\n 'Kanduli'  and other fishes sought refuge elsewhere.\n  \n\n \n\n\n \" As the water came to a standstill, water hyacinth\nblossomed in unimaginable thickets.\n\n\nOil slicks, gases and other pollutants merged to spew out foul air.\n\n\n\nThe degraded state of the river had never before been more\nunbearable,\"  deplored the professor who studied for her doctorate in\nenvironmental science at the University of the Philippines. \n\n \n\nToday, the river is totally polluted.\n\n\nIn the Philippine context, pollution means  \" any\nalteration of the properties of a resource which renders the latter harmful\nor injurious to public health, safety and welfare, or which adversely affects\nits intended use. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nAt all times, Pasig is  \" extremely turbid and\nblack,\"  according to the Philippine Environmental Action Network, a\nnon-government organization which engages in direct community action and\ndevelops sustainable development alternatives.\n\n\nBut it  \" gets to its worst condition during the dry\nseason when shallow currents expose black decomposing waste which releases\nodorous gases, including hydrogen sulfide, &rdquo;  it added. \n\n \n\nGovernment classifies the Pasig River as a Class C body of water,\none intended for the  \" propagation and growth of fish and other\naquatic resources. &rdquo; \n\n \n\nWaters classified as A and AA are usable as public water supply,\nB for swimming and other forms of recreation, D for agriculture and\nindustries, while E is limited for navigation. \n\n \n\nA feasibility study conducted in 1990-91 by the Department of\nEnvironment and Natural Resources with funding from Danida disclosed that\npollution in the 24 kilometer waterway is composed of 45 percent liquid\nindustrial waste, another 45 percent from liquid domestic waste, and the\nremaining ten percent from solid domestic waste.\n\n\nSolid waste refers to garbage from households, companies, schools,\nbusinesses, hospitals and laboratories. \n\n \n\nOver 2,000 industries within Metro Manila, the study found,\ndischarge their pollutants into the river, and some 12,800 squatter families\ndwell along the river 's banks. \n\n \n\nAnother study showed that Metro Manila dumps at least 1,500 tons\nof refuse daily into the Pasig River.\n\n\nThe industrial firms and factories along its banks dump about 12.5\nmillion gallons per year of untreated industrial waste water. \n\n \n\n \" It 's not too late yet.\n\n\nWe can bring the Pasig River back to life.\" \n\n\nThis is the assertion of the Pasig River Rehabilitation Program (\nPRRP), a comprehensive government project to revive the fabled river\nimmortalized by Dr. Jose Rizal in his travelogues. \n\n \n\nThe PRRP strategic program has a target period of 10-15 years,\nwith an estimated cost of over &peso;10billion.\n\n\nAlthough there have been efforts in the past to rehabilitate the\nriver, many of these previous attempts were not successful.\n\n\nFormer First Lady Imelda Marcos, for instance, fantasized of\ntransforming the polluted river into the country 's newest tourist\nattraction, with floating restaurants, casinos, and shopping malls. \n\n \n\nFormer President Corazon Aquino also vowed to restore the dying\nriver before the six-year-term expired.\n\n\nHer vision did not materialize. \n\n \n\nThis time, it is the turn of First Lady Amelita \" Ming\n&rdquo; Ramos to save the river from total annihilation.\n\n\nShe has adopted it as one of her priority projects under the Clean\nand Green Program. \n\n \n\nActing in her private capacity, the First Lady convened\nnon-governmental organizations and government agencies, with the help of the\nGreen Coalition chaired by Senator Orlando S. Mercado, to further narrow the\ngaps in the various efforts to save the Pasig River. \n\n \n\n \" The centuries have not been kind to this great\nriver,\"  noted Mrs. Ramos. \n\n\n \" Today, the Pasig River is on the verge of dying.\n\n\nIts hue is the color of mourning, its odor the stench of despair.\n\n\n\nIt is not yet too late to reverse the errors of the past, &rdquo;\n she said. \n\n \n\nThis led to the creation of the  Sagip  Pasig\nMovement ( SPM),which was established as key coordinator of government, NGO\nand private sector efforts.\n\n\nIts aim is to generate the environmental awareness necessary to\nencourage community participation in the rehabilitation effort. \n\n \n\nThe SPM participates in the work of the Presidential Task Force\nthrough its two member organizations: the Green Coalition, representing NGOs;\nand the Philippine Business for Environment, representing the business\nsector.\n\n\nThe PRRP Secretariat sits in the steering committee of the SPM to\nensure a close link between their activities. \n\n \n\nFor its part, the Metro Manila Authority gave its own\ncontribution to the cause by conducting Waterways Sanitation Services ( WSS)\nand the  \" Oplan Pasiglahin ang Ilog Pasig. &rdquo; \n\n\n \n\nManila Representative Ramon Bagatsing, Jr., on the other hand,\nendorsed  \" Sagipin ang Ilog Pasig &rdquo;  to\nrehabilitate the moribund Pasig River.\n\n\nIn his House Bill No. 1130, he urged for the creation of a council\nthat includes the chairman of the Metro Manila Development Authority ( MMDA),\nthe mayors of Manila, Pasig, Pateros and Makati, a representative each from\nthe two chambers of Congress, the Secretary of the Department of Environment\nand Natural Resources ( DENR), the Philippine Coast Guard, and three\nrepresentatives from non-governmental organizations ( NGOs). \n\n \n\n \" It will take three presidential terms to save\nPasig,\"  explained Ms. Ramos during the launching of the  \nPiso Para Sa Pasig   ( PPP) in October 1995.\n\n\nPPP is an ambitious endeavor created to tackle the herculean task of\ncleaning-up and rehabilitating the country 's most famed river. \n\n \n\nThe PPP was conceptualized by the Clean and Green Foundation,\nRiver Rehabilitation Secretariat of the environment department, the Center\nfor Corporate Citizenship of the Philippine Business for Social Progress, the\nPhilippine Business for the Environment and the  Sagip  Pasig\nMovement. \n\n \n\nThe goal of PPP is  \" to ensure the continuity of\nPasig-related projects even after the present administration, &rdquo;\n stressed Ms. Ramos, who chairs the PPP campaign board. \n\n \n\nPart of PPP 's activities is a fund-raising drive to put up a\n&peso;50 million trust fund for private sector projects to rehabilitate the\nriver. \n\n \n\n \" Your help, even if it is as little as a peso,\nwill see the Pasig Waterfront Development Project of the PPP to completion,\n&rdquo;  said its officials. \n\n \n\nThe contributions collected will help build a Roxas Boulevard\nRiverside Park, where donors will have their names inscribed on a specially\nconstructed wall.\n\n\nIn addition, a Pasig River \" Walk of Fame &rdquo; with patrons '\nnames will be etched along the 1.3 kilometers easement - - from Roxas Bridge\nto the MET theater. \n\n \n\n \" If we all do our share, we may soon see the Pasig\nRiver reborn, &rdquo;  said the PPP officials. \n\n \n\nMeanwhile, some business sectors gamely responded to the call of\nthe First Lady in helping revive the river.\n\n\nOne of them is Eduardo Manuel, president of Starcraft Corporation and\nSouth Sea Drive and Travel Supply, Inc. \n\n \n\nManuel believes the river can be resurrected by making it a route\nfor ferry boats.\n\n\n \" The shuttle ferry services, dubbed as Pasig River\nFerry 2000, would provide a cheaper, faster and convenient alternative to\ncommuters,\"  Manuel explained.\n\n\n \" There 's big business for this project, but it is not\nreally the business we 're after.\n\n\nWe also want to provide the public with a more comfortable and faster\nmeans of transportation, &rdquo;

{"text": "Riding the Red Tide  \n\n\n  When the rainy season comes, devastation follows for the\nPhilippine shellfish  \n\n\n Nati Nuguid \n\n \n\nSEAWEEDS were her first field of study, but when red tide\ninfestation of the seas started to become a recurring phenomenon in the\nPhilippines, Dr. Rhodora Azanza, a professor at the UP Institute of Marine\nScience, considered going into researching what lay behind it.\n\n\nSince then, Azanza has become the coordinator of the ASEAN Red Tide\nNetwork.\n\n\nRed tide is an occurrence that has been observed not only in the\nPhilippines and neighboring countries, but in other parts of the world as\nwell--Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Norway and Denmark, Canada and the\nUnited States.\n\n\n\" Red tide \" refers to the accumulation of red\nmicroscopic marine plants or algae called \" dinoflagellates\n\" that can color the sea red when they become proliferous enough.\n\n\n \n\n  Poisonous.  \n\n\nSingly, a cell of the dinoflagellate does not look so threatening.\n\n\nSingle-celled, roundish and with hairs that enable it to move in\nwater, a dinoflagellate may be ingested when swimming in infested waters with\nno effect to the human body.\n\n\nGiven the right conditions, however--warm water temperatures, the\ninflow into the sea of organic pollutants that get washed down with the\nrains--the cyst blooms, or proliferates, becoming highly poisonous. \n\n \n\nIn large densities the red tide 1) has given the Red Sea its\nname, 2) is often the cause of large fishkills ( remember the floating dead\nfish in the Manila Bay in October 1996?) and 3) ingested by mussels and other\nshellfish, which become the vectors that transfer the effect of the \"\nblooms &rdquo; to humans.\n\n\nThis species of dinoflagellates that causes the red tide produces a\ntoxin that causes paralysis of the nerves and the respiratory system in\nhumans, leading to serious cases of poisoning to death. \n\n \n\nIn open seas, the danger is slight.\n\n\nIf the temperature of the water is low, the pollutants may disperse.\n\n\nBut in bodies of water like the Manila Bay, says Azanza, the danger\nis high.\n\n\nThe bay is almost enclosed by land; its mouth is too narrow to allow\nthe polluted waters to flow out to the sea and allow the inflow of clean sea\nwater.\n\n\nThis condition becomes favorable for the proliferation of the\ndinoflagellates during certain periods of the year. \n\n \n\n \" The resting stage of the cysts, &rdquo; \nexplains Azanza,  \" get embedded in the sediment on the floor of\nthe bay.\n\n\nUnder favorable conditions, as during the rainy season, the sediment\nis disturbed, freeing cysts [ to germinate] or [ bloom] into cells [ that]\ncan move. &rdquo; \n\n\nWhen the blooms become dense enough, she says, they give the sea a\nred color.\n\n\nMussels and other shellfish farmed on the coasts of the Manila Bay,\nfrom Limay in Bataan at the north channel down to Ternate in Cavite, ingest\nwater contaminated with the cysts. \n\n \n\n \" Mussels are specially vulnerable, their feeding\nbehavior being less selective than other marine organisms, &rdquo; \nAzanza says.\n\n\nIt has been observed, however, that shellfish cultured in the\nshallower parts of the bay contain less dinoflagellates than those raised in\ndeeper parts.\n\n\nAt low tide, Azanza explains, the shells are exposed. \n\n \n\nAs first consumers of the dinoflagellate, the shellfish can\nsurvive the toxins.\n\n\nPassed on to humans, however--the mussel or oyster eaters--they\nbecome harmful.\n\n\nThe symptoms range from mild to severe neurological disorders called\nparalytic shellfish poisoning, or PSP.\n\n\nThe victim feels a numbness around the lips and has difficulty of\nbreathing.\n\n\nLater paralysis takes over.\n\n\n \" The toxins attack the nervous system and respiratory\norgans, &rdquo;  says Azanza. \n\n \n\nThe dinoflagellates need inorganic nutrients such as nitrates and\nphosphorus.\n\n\nThese may come with the rains, which wash them down to the sea, and\nalso from wastes thrown into the sea from ships.\n\n\nThe blooms usually occur following heavy rainfall.\n\n\nWith the \"  El Ni&ntilde;o  \" ,\nhowever, there has been no incidence of red tide except last month in Hong\nKong, where all fishing was knocked out. \n\n \n\n   La Ni&ntilde;a.   \n\n\nFor all the economic disaster that \"  El Ni&ntilde;o\n \" has caused ( according to the Asian Development Bank,\nmore than &dollar;20 billion in losses for Indonesia, Malaysia, the\nPhilippines, Singapore and the Pacific islands, and a 1 percent reduction in\nproductivity for this year), those who live on the mussels and oyster\nbusiness are thankful for it: because there are no rains, the seas have\nremained largely undisturbed.\n\n\nAnd so are the dinoflagellates.\n\n\nBut when the rains come ( about July, says the weather bureau), the\nmicroorganisms, among them the species of marine algae that produce the\nparalysis-inducing toxins, will surface and proliferate.\n\n\nAzanza warns of \"  La Ni&ntilde;a \n\" , the period of heavy rains that follows \"  El\nNi&ntilde;o  \" , and renewed red-tide infestations of the\nseas.\n\n\nShellfish farmers in sites known to have red-tide infestations have\nbeen advised to harvest their produce before \"  La\nNi&ntilde;a  \" occurs. \n\n \n\nSince 1988, blooms of the   pyrodinium bahamense\n  of the   compressum   variety,\nthe scientific name for the harmful dinoflagellates, have been recurring\nalong the coasts of Manila Bay.\n\n\nMonthly samplings of the coastal waters, from April 1993 to May 1994,\nshowed various densities of the cyst, with Bataan having the highest at 176\nplus or minus 39 cysts per cubic centimeter of water, and Bulacan the lowest\nat 11 plus or minus 3 per ccm.\n\n\nLiving cysts were found in all areas throughout the year. \n\n \n\nThere have been seasonal variations in the cyst densities at\ndifferent locations, with the higher counts being recorded during April to\nAugust and the lower in the bay area suggest that blooms are coming from\noverlying and adjacent waters and that means these areas are infested. \n\n \n\nAccording to a paper on the impacts of harmful algae on\nseafarming in the Asia-Pacific region, written by Azanza ( under her married\nname, Rhodora A. Corrales) and Jal L. Maclean of the International Center for\nLiving Aquatic Resources Management, 3,164 recorded cases of poisoning and\n148 deaths have been recorded in the region.\n\n\nEconomic losses from a single occurrence may exceed &dollar;1\nmillion, while monitoring costs may be up to &dollar;50,000 a year for each\nstricken area.\n\n\nNational action plans include shellfish sanitation programs, public\nawareness and education, coastal engineering and classification of waters to\nprotect public health. \n\n \n\nThe   P. bahamense var. compressum  \nhas been the major cause of toxic red tides in the Philippines, with 1,618\ncases of poisoning and 100 deaths.\n\n\nThe first blooming occurred off Samar in 1988 and was observed by\nJapanese marine researchers.\n\n\nIt has been recurring almost every year since then. \n\n \n\nStudies conducted by a team headed by Azanza showed that cyst\ndensities between Bataan ( northwest side of the bay) and Canacao ( northeast\nwithin the bay) are not significantly different from each other but they are\nsignificantly different from Bulacan, Pampanga, Para&ntilde;aque and Ternate,\nwhich are all located in the inner portion of the bay.\n\n\nLimay, in Bataan, showing the highest density of cysts has an almost\nyear-round red-tide outbreak.\n\n\nThe second highest density was recorded for Canacao Bay in Cavite.\n\n\nPoisonings have been reported in this area, which has a booming\nmussel-farming industry. \n\n \n\nPara&ntilde;aque and Metro Manila had the third highest density\nat an average of 38 plus or minus 5 cysts per cubic centimeter.\n\n\nFourth highest was Ternate, Cavite.\n\n\nOyster farming is common in this area ( especially near the mouth of\nthe Maragondon River).\n\n\nCyst density in Pampanga Bay was 14 plus or minus 5 cysts/cubic\ncentimeter, the fifth highest.\n\n\nPamarawan, Bulacan, had the lowest average density at 11 plus minus 3\ncysts per cubic centimeter.\n\n\nOyster farming and seasonal gathering of bivalves also flourish in\nthis area. \n\n \n\nWith a comparatively high per capita fishery consumption of 41 (\ncomparable to Malaysia at 43; China, 45; Japan, 83), the Philippines has\nalways been hard hit by red-tide infestations, with staggering fish and\nshrimp kills and numerous poisonings.\n\n\nIn the region, red-tide poisoning also happens with infestations in\nBrunei and Malaysia. \n\n \n\n  Panic.  \n\n\nWhat happens during occasional acute outbreaks, with reports of\npoisoning, offers an opportunity for a study of public behavior and reaction\nto disaster.\n\n\nNotable is the sudden panic among the people that triggers an\noverreaction, which does not do much to ease the situation, in fact worsens\nit.\n\n\nThe economic impact can be disproportionately large because consumers\nwho are not well informed about the cause and consequences of the outbreak\ntend to avoid even non-contaminated seafood. \n\n \n\nAn account of the infestation of Manila Bay in 1998 ( in the \nJournal of Applied Psychology  , 1995) reflects what happens in a place\nwhere there is not much understanding of a red-tide outbreak: In August and\nSeptember 1998, an outbreak occurred in Manila Bay.\n\n\nBecause it was played up by the media without regard to accuracy, the\nwhole seafood industry nearly ground to a halt.\n\n\nMussel growers even tried to cast suspicion on freshwater fish to\navoid the swing by consumers to  tilapia  and other\nfishes.\n\n\nAll fish markets in Manila were depressed for about three months,\nsimilar to the case in San Francisco in 1980.\n\n\nConsidering that Manila 's seafoods market handles 35 percent of the\nnation 's fish haul, the losses were large, up to &dollar;300,000 daily at\nthe height of the scare.\n\n\nJapan and Singapore banned shrimp imports from the Philippines for\nsome time ( although they were clean), which would have meant losses of\n&dollar;500,000 daily if the produce was not subsequently sold.\n\n\nLosses by mussel growers for a three-month period were more modest,\nabout &dollar;950,000 throughout. \n\n \n\nIf life is threatened, there is no option but to close seafarming\nsites permanently.\n\n\nIn Southeast Asia, some seafarmed areas have had to be permanently\nclosed and these include the Philippines ' Banban Bay, Masinloc and Benoni\nLagoon in Mindanao.\n\n\nA permanent ban on the fish   Gobius criniger \n ( common name,  goby  ) , which feeds on microalgae\nand sporadically becomes toxic without sufficient warning has been\nrecommended by the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources. \n\n \n\nWhat causes algal poisoning of shellfish?\n\n\nThe researchers have a few theories.\n\n\nMaybe, it is just that today, with advanced technology, there is\nincreased awareness of the poisonous species.\n\n\nCoastal waters are increasingly used for aquaculture.\n\n\nEuthropication has occurred.\n\n\nThis is a situation where increased presence of mineral and organic\nsubstances has decreased the dissolved oxygen in the water and produced an\nenvironment favorable to plant rather than animal life. \n\n \n\nUnusual climatological conditions stimulate algal blooms.\n\n\nDinoflagellate cysts can be transported from one place to another\nthrough the ballast water in ships.\n\n\nThe transfer of shellfish stocks can also bring about incidents of\nalgal bloom. \n\n \n\nMore recent hypotheses to explain poisonous algal outbreaks\ninclude the loss of wetlands or swamps ( reclaimed for purposes like housing\nor industry), overfishing and fish diseases.\n\n\nGlobal changes can also trigger an outbreak of red tide. \n\n \n\nEnvironmentalists are one in denouncing the pollution of the seas\nas a cause of the proliferation of the red-tide algae.\n\n\nHigh water temperatures along with the input of organic compounds\nthat flow into the sea with heavy rains form the right combination that can\ncause the dinoflagellates to multiply rapidly. \n\n \n\nFishkills can happen in enclosed bays ( like the Manila Bay) when\nthe blooms, otherwise quite harmless, and the bacteria decomposing them, use\nup the available oxygen in the water, depriving the fish and other forms of\nmarine life of the life giving compound and killing them by the thousands.\n\n\nFishkills do not happen in the open sea, but in sheltered bays with\nrestricted outflows. \n\n \n\nBut not all dinoflagellates are harmful, says a plankton\nspecialist, Dr. Gustaaf Hallegraef.\n\n\nHe points out that  \" of 1,500 species floating in the\nworld 's oceans, only a mere 20 have the ability to produce toxins. &rdquo;\n\n\n\nBecause they are exceedingly small, he says, each can produce only\nminute quantities of the toxin.\n\n\nOne does not suffer any effect from swimming in infected waters, for\ninstance, because of the small amount of dinoflagellates that can be ingested\nwhile swimming.\n\n\n \" It 's when we eat seafood that fed on the\ndinoflagellates that the problem arises, &rdquo;  Hallegraef says.\n\n\nOysters, mussels and scallops extract large quantities of the\ndinoflagellates from the water continuously passing through their gills.\n\n\nThe accumulated toxin, though apparently harmless to the shellfish,\nmakes the shellfish a time bomb.\n\n\nThe person who eats the shellfish gets poisoned. \n\n \n\n  Symptoms.  \n\n\nThe severity of the symptoms can range from a mild stomach upset\nwith diarrhea to severe neurological disorders classified as paralytic\nshellfish poisoning, which can result in death from paralysis of the\nrespiratory muscles. \n\n \n\nRegularly testing the sea water for dinoflagellates will prevent\nthe sale of contaminated shellfish.\n\n\nIf dinoflagellates are found, the shellfish must be tested for\ntoxins.\n\n\nThis is an expensive procedure, though.\n\n\nMussels are often the most contaminated, as their feeding behavior\nis less selective than that of oysters.\n\n\nPoisoning symptoms: numbing of the lips, fingertips and toes and\nmild respiratory problems. \n\n \n\nWhat to do?\n\n\nOne might normally suppose that some method could be developed by\nwhich the dinoflagellates can be neutralized or removed from the water.\n\n\nDr. Hallegraef is skeptical about this.\n\n\n \" Even if this can be done, &rdquo;  he says,\n \" it will be futile. \n\n\nThe dormant stage of the organism, a spore or cyst, will remain in\nthe sediment on the floor of the ocean, ready to germinate as soon as the\nconditions--a warm temperature and nutrients--are right.\n\n\nThey can stay dormant up to 20 or 30 years. &rdquo;  \n\n\n \n\nHibernation, then, enables the dinoflagellate to exist from\nbloom to bloom.\n\n\nReproduction is simple: asexual--all it takes is to split in two.\n\n\n \n\nFilipino shellfish farmers can learn from the Japanese.\n\n\nIn Japan, they study the species, learn to identify the harmful from\nthe nonharmful, and monitor their growth.\n\n\nThey watch out for any increase in the density of the blooms and\nharvest their shellfish before the blooms reach dangerous proportions.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "5b5b78ce-7f96-4f66-811a-02da72248148", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.257591+00:00"}
{"text": "CDMA gets ready for 3G migration  \n\n\n By Edwin P. Sallan \n\n \n\nHONG KONG - -\n\n\nIf you can't beat 'em, join 'em -- at least for the time being. \n\n With more than 120 million subscribers worldwide, third generation ( 3G)\ndigital wireless communications based on the Code Division Multiple Access (\nCDMA) platform is now firmly established and continues to grow at a\nphenomenal rate, so says the CDMA Development Group ( CDG) that organized the\n3G World Congress held last week at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition\nCentre. \n\n \n\n \" CDMA continues to expand rapidly around the world\nand is leading in 3G adoption, &rdquo;  beams Perry La Forge,\nexecutive director of CDG.\n\n\n \" The subscriber demand for wireless data connectivity\ncontinues to increase and opens new opportunities for service providers and\nmanufacturers. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nBut even with this encouraging development, Qualcomm, the company\nthat pioneered CDMA technology, is determined to make inroads in territories\nwhere2G systems based on the Global System for Mobile communications ( GSM)\nstandard remain in place.\n\n\nGSM remains the dominant platform for mobile communications, with some\n680 million subscribers worldwide from mostly European and Asian countries,\nthe Philippines included. \n\n \n\nQualcomm, which supplies both hardware and software technology to\n3G mobile communications vendors, has announced multi-platform solutions\nwhich it hopes would ultimately lead to full 3G migration. \n\n \n\nThese include chipset solutions like the MSM6200, the MGP6200\nMultimode Global Positioning System ( GPS) and system software and the\nradioOne 6300, which will bridge 2G and 3G technologies on GSM, and GPRS (\ngeneral packet radio system). \n\n \n\nThere 's also the new BREW ( Binary Runtime Environment for\nWireless) software application platform that can run on both CDMA and GSM\nhardware and further enhance their capabilities while sitting on top of other\nsimilar technologies like Java and running unobtrusively in the background.\n\n\n \n\n \" Although the 3G direction which the vast majority\nof carriers are taking throughout the world is CDMA ( either CDMA2000 or\nW-CDMA), the strategy to recognize that GSM networks and subscribers will be\naround for some time is a reflection of our commitment to provide users with\n3G capabilities, with the ability to roam anywhere in the world, &rdquo;\n says Marshall Towe Jr., managing director of Qualcomm Southeast\nAsia. \n\n \n\nTowe acknowledges that even as many parts of the world are now\nenjoying the unsurpassed user experience that only 3G can provide,\nparticularly Korea where CDMA is now prevalent, GSM strongholds are not\nlikely to make the switch overnight. \n\n \n\n \" The convergence from GSM to CDMA will take time\nand full convergence to 3G is still years away, &rdquo;  he concedes.\n\n\n \" In the meantime, the 3G capability ( of\nGSM-compatible products) bridges the gap. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nEven as Qualcomm is coming up with such multi-platform solutions\nto penetrate the GSM market, Towe disclosed that the company remains firm in\nits commitment to bring 3G technology everywhere in the world via theCDMA2000\nand W-CDMA platforms.\n\n\nQualcomm is particularly keen on rolling out 3G service in the\nPhilippines, which Towe describes as  \" an awesome, strong\nmarket, very Western in many ways and without language issues. &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\n \" We would like to work with one of the existing\n800-MHz operators in your country to roll out 3G service thru CDMA2000 in the\nvery near future, &rdquo;  Towe enthuses.\n\n\n \" The success of Korea, United States, Japan and now\nmany other countries shows that this technology can be of great benefit to\nthe consumers and allows operators a very cost-effective and efficient way to\nquickly and easily roll out 3G services. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nTowe also points out that building blocks are already in place to\nmake 3G an immediate reality in the Philippines, although Qualcomm still\nneeds to work out some issues with network providers and government\nregulating agencies like the National Telecommunications Commission.\n\n\nHe notes that the country still has a small CDMA system from Piltel\nin place with some 50,000 subscribers and identifies both Piltel and another\nnetwork provider, sister company Smart, as mobile operators that are capable\nof doing 3G right now. \n\n \n\nAs demonstrated in several keynote speeches and roundtable\ndiscussions during the Hong Kong congress, 3G in its present commercial\nincarnation is by far the most advanced form of mobile communications\ntechnology available today.\n\n\nWireless devices powered by Qualcomm chip sets and BREW technology\nlike cellular handsets, personal digital assistants and modem cards are\nloaded with such features as high-speed Internet access, global roaming,\ncrystal-clear voice quality, symphonic ringing tones, high-resolution color\ndisplays, built-in digital cameras, streaming video and MP3 players,\ndownloadable multimedia games and other applications. \n\n \n\nOne compelling application is position location services, which\ncan either help prevent a user from getting lost in a certain vicinity with\nthe help of an interactive onscreen map or easily follow and track down the\nlocation of anyone or more given companions within a five-meter radius. \n\n \n\nTowe believes this application is just one of the many 3G\ntechnologies that are likely to become popular with Filipino consumers when\n3G finally takes off in the country.  \n\n\n\n\n  Treo takes on Nokia 9210  \n\n\n By JV Rufino \n\n \n\nFOR quite a while now I have been using the Handspring Treo 180 -\n- Handspring 's latest attempt to merge a cellular phone with a PDA - - as my\nprimary phone to see how well it copes with the rigors of day-to-day use and\nhow it compares with the Nokia 9210 Communicator, Nokia 's take on the\nphone-PDA hybrid. \n\n \n\nFirst off, both products show the heritage of their makers,\n i.e.  , PDA manufacturer or phone manufacturer. \n\n \n\n\" Handspring \" was formed by the original team\nthat made the first \" Palm \" and their expertise shows.\n\n\nAs a PDA, the Treo is better than the Communicator.\n\n\nThe Treo 's Palm OS-based PDA applications are more intuitive than\ntheir counterparts on the Communicator and the Treo is more stable ( the\nCommunicator needing more than the occasional reset).\n\n\nOn the other hand, the Communicator doesn't need a stylus, relying\ninstead on gamepad-like cursor pad.\n\n\nAlthough it takes getting used to, at least with the Communicator you\ndon't have to worry about losing a stylus in the middle of a busy day.\n\n\nAnd its screen is colored to the Treo 's monochrome. \n\n \n\nOn the other hand, the Treo is clunkier as a phone.\n\n\nBattery life, voice quality, reception and volume are not as good as\nthat of the Communicator ( though not exceptionally bad either), since Nokia\nknows how to make phones. \n\n \n\nThe integration of the Address Book with SMS and e-mail is also\nbetter on the Communicator than on the Treo.\n\n\nOn the Treo, SMS and e-mail are separate applications and if you want\nto send a fax you 'll need a third-party program.\n\n\nSMS, e-mail and faxes are all stored in a single application on the\nCommunicator - - a more elegant way of keeping track of who said what to whom\n( the situation is reversed when it comes to surfing, the Communicator having\none browser for Wap and another for the Web while the Treo 's Blazer browser\ndisplays both HTML and WAP pages). \n\n \n\nThis isn't to say that the Treo doesn't have some nice touches as\na phone.\n\n\nMy favorite is the dedicated switch that places the phone on silent\nmode.\n\n\nDefinitely better than going through the Nokia Profiles menu when you\nneed to squelch the ringer fast such as when in a movie house or church.\n\n\nThe rocker switch on the left side also proves handy though it took a\nbit of experimenting to figure out how to use it to its full potential.\n\n\nAnd the Treo is a lot handier than the Communicator, which has never\nbeen famous for being dainty ( the price though is you forego the\nCommunicator 's roomy keyboard and have to make do with the Treo 's \"\nthumb-board &rdquo;

Gates II, Microsoft Chairman\nand CEO, visited the Philippines just recently he spoke of the critical role\ngovernments play in propelling the nation towards a  connected community\n - - an information network that connects citizens, businesses,\ngovernment agencies, service companies, and schools.\n\n\nHe also foretold the development of the Digital Nervous System ( DNS)\nwhich would someday eliminate paperwork, reduce bureaucracy, and enhance\nlearning. \n\n \n\nWith the current deregulation of the telecommunication industry,\nvarious companies are welcoming the Filipino clientele to a world where time\nand space are no longer barriers for communication.\n\n\nProducts of progress such as cellular telephones and pagers, optical\nfibers, multimedia computers, and the Internet are capable of delivering\nquality services tailored to the needs of the consumers. \n\n\n  Cellular wonders  \n\n \n\nCellular telephones or cell phones were introduced in the early\n1980s.\n\n\nIn this system, a city or a district is broken into a series of \ncells  , each is equipped with its own central transmitter-receiver.\n\n\nThese cells are technically arranged to handle different frequencies,\nthough the same frequency can be used throughout the system.\n\n\nFor instance, as a car or a person moves from one cell to the next,\nthe call remains active and continues. \n\n \n\nCell phones began as analog devices with AMPS or Advanced Mobile\nPhone System as the analog standard.\n\n\nToday, powerful and more efficient digital cellular systems are being\nintroduced to the public.\n\n\nNotable among these are the proven GSM or Global System for Mobile\nCommunication and the emerging CDMA or the Code Division Multiple Access.\n\n\nBoth systems are capable of delivering clear calls, text messaging,\ndata transmission, caller ID, and clone protection aside from other\ntop-of-the-line features. \n\n\n  Beeps of boon  \n\n \n\nDevelopments in radio technology paved for the introduction of\nthe beeper.\n\n\nThe device is activated when it receives a special radio signal.\n\n\nBefore, most of the people who own beepers are in the medical\nprofession.\n\n\nIn an emergency situation, they can be easily notified.\n\n\nAs the prices of beepers roll down with features on the upswing, even\nordinary students can afford to maintain a pager.\n\n\nWith the group paging feature, it is possible for a sales office to\nnotify all its sales executives of an emergency meeting all at the same time.\n\n\n \n\nAt present several paging companies offer valuable paging\nservices to its sub-scribers.\n\n\nThese include news, stock market reports, traffic updates, voice mail\nservices, and even e-mail ( electronic mail) paging. \n\n \n\nOn the hardware side, beepers have evolved from being stand-alone\nalpha-numeric message receivers.\n\n\nThe latest generation of pagers has multiple alert tones, time and\ndate stamping capability, auto on/off functions, caller ID, and other\ninnovative features. \n\n\n  Fibers of light  \n\n \n\nThere are many modes of transmitting a telephone call.\n\n\nOne is through copper wire, which transmits calls in the form of\nelectronic impulses.\n\n\nThen, there is the microwave, which transforms the call into radio\nwaves.\n\n\nSatellite communication is a development of microwave used for\nintercontinental relay of messages. \n\n \n\nIn the early 1980s, the supremacy of the satellite and microwave\nwas challenged with the entry of fiber optics.\n\n\nIn fiber optic communication, the message is translated into light\nimpulses, which travel into extremely thin glass fibers.\n\n\nTheoretically, a single strand of fiber optics, which is about the\nsame proportion as the human hair, has the capacity of handling millions of\ntelephone conversations with a far better quality than the copper-line\ncounterpart.\n\n\nOptical fibers provide a state-of-the-art communication channel for\nthose who demand information at the fastest way.\n\n\nTo facilitate cross-country fiber optic communication, submarine\ncables are laid in the bottom of the sea. \n\n\n  Surfing without the waves  \n\n \n\nWhat!\n\n\nSurfing without waves and surfboards?\n\n\nYes!\n\n\nIt is possible, but to do that you need a modem-equipped computer, a\ntelephone line, and a subscription with an Internet service provider ( ISP).\n\n\n \n\nThe Internet or information superhighway is the network of all\ncomputer networks.\n\n\n\"  Netizens  \" , as the Internet surfers\nare called, may send and receive E-mails ( electronic mails) around the world\nfaster than postal mail;

{"text": "RP: Asia 's next energy exporter?  \n\n\n Emmie V. Abadilla \n\n \n\nThe Philippines, which imports over 200 million barrels of fuel\noil annually, can become an energy exporter to East Asia in 30 years. \n\n \n\nThat is, if it plays its cards right and government lures enough\nprivate businesses to build large scale ocean, solar and wind power ( OSW)\nsystems. \n\n \n\nIt will cost the state &dollar;29 million ( &peso;754 million)\njust to establish a short-term plan of action. \n\n \n\nNever mind long term costs.\n\n\nThe tab for establishing an Asian power grid, a regional power market\ncentered in the Philippines, as well as OSW plants and manufacturing\nindustries for OSW power systems cannot be ascertained to date. \n\n \n\nOne thing is sure, however.\n\n\nThe Philippines gains 266 million megawatts of exportable power. \n\n \n\nAnd the prospect is not even a remote dream. \n\n \n\n \" The technology is available, the only problem is\neconomics, &rdquo;  stressed Department of Energy ( DOE)\nUndersecretary Guillermo Balce. \n\n \n\nOf course, technology using new locally-sourced renewable energy\nhas always been more expensive than traditional technologies using imported\nresources such as oil, gas and coal. \n\n \n\nIt costs only &dollar;750 to produce one kilowatt ( kw) of\nelectricity using gas, &dollar;900 per kw, using oil and &dollar;1,150/kw,\nusing coal. \n\n \n\nGenerating electricity through wind power costs &dollar;1,000/kw,\nthrough biomass using ricehull, &dollar;1,400/kw and municipal solid waste,\n&dollar;2,500/kw. \n\n \n\nBut using ocean power, one spends a whopping &dollar;11,000/kw\nand &dollar;7,000/kw, for solar energy. \n\n \n\nOnce OSW power is produced on a large scale with  \"\nthe determined effort of government and private sector &rdquo;  ,\neconomies of scale could eventually prevail. \n\n \n\nDeveloping alternative sources of energy is inevitable. \n\n \n\nDOE underscored that traditional sources of indigenous power will\nnot make the Philippines energy self-sufficient within 30 years. \n\n \n\nWithout OSW, the country will still import 60 percent of its\nenergy needs. \n\n \n\nOcean, solar and wind power sources has a potential for\ngenerating more than enough power to provide the 100,000 mw requirements of\nthe Philippines by year 2025. \n\n \n\nAnd it 's about time the country is weaned from traditional\nenergy sources which are hazardous to the environment. \n\n \n\nPower plants using coal and fossil fuels emit sulfur dioxides,\nnitrogen oxides and toxic gases that contribute to global warming.\n\n\nThe dreaded \" \" greenhouse effect. &rdquo; \"\n\n\n \n\nOn top of that, undiscovered sources of oil, gas, coal and\nnuclear power will generate a scant 59,000 mw. \n\n \n\nThe amount of discovered resources can only provide 29,000 MW, or\n12 percent of the total energy demand 28 years from now. \n\n \n\nOn the other hand, renewable sources of energy such as OSW, are\nnot just environment-friendly but inexhaustible as well. \n\n \n\nThe only hitch is they are mainly undefined. \n\n \n\nDOE estimates undefined and undiscovered capacity for ocean power\nat 300 million mw and 864,000 mw for solar power.\n\n\nThe defined capacity for wind power, on the other hand, is 200 mw.\n\n\n \n\nGeothermal power still has 1,300 mw of undefined capacity.\n\n\nBiomass has 6,000 mw. \n\n \n\nBesides being a tremendous untapped powerhouse located in an area\nof vast ocean, solar and wind resources, the Philippines has other advantages\nas an exporter of power. \n\n \n\nGeographically the country is in a strategic position in plans\nfor an Asian power interconnection. \n\n \n\nBeing at the center of the region, it can be a central\ndistributor of OSW power. \n\n \n\n \" We can become an energy exporter to Asia if we\nfocus on ocean, solar and wind resources, &rdquo;  Balce reiterated.\n\n\n \n\nOcean energy options had been used by other countries for quite\nsometime. \n\n \n\nTidal power systems using the recurring rise and fall of coastal\nwaters in response to the gravitational pull of the sun and moon, had been\noperating in France as early as 1996; in the USSR since 1967; Canada and\nChina have used them since the 80s. \n\n \n\nWave energy systems, where large scale wind machines powered by\nthe sun generate waves had generated less than 500 kw in demo units in the\nUnited Kingdom, Norway, Japan and the US. \n\n \n\nLarge scale commercial applications are not feasible to date,\nhowever.\n\n\nOperators find it difficult to maintain stations during stormy seas\nand costly to use power conditioning equipment to provide steady outputs\nunder varying wave conditions. \n\n \n\nOcean Thermal Energy Conversion ( OTEC), using temperature\ndifferences between warm surface waters and cold waters from the sea bottom\nto power turbines, had been demonstrated in experimental 50 kw systems in\nHawaii.\n\n\nThey are now developing an experimental 165 kw OTEC system. \n\n \n\nOcean current systems, operating underwater windmills or turbines\npowered by the flow of moving water had been tested in Canada, and Australia.\n\n\n \n\nOn the other hand, wind turbine generators had been installed\nworldwide since 1993, with capacities of about 3,000 mw. \n\n \n\nUS leads major users and developers of wind energy, boasting of\n1,700 mw total capacity.\n\n\nEurope is catching up, installing the world 's largest wind turbines,\nwith capacities ranging from 100kw to 340kw per unit. \n\n \n\nAsian countries have the most number of small scale units at less\nthan 1 kw per unit. \n\n \n\nBy 2005, experts estimate that wind turbines generating 18,500 mw\nwill be installed in US, India, China, Spain and Germany. \n\n \n\nMeanwhile, in the Philippines, the National Power Corp. has\ninstalled a 10 kw wind turbine demonstration unit for a small village power\nproject in Ilocos Norte. \n\n \n\nThen, we have photovoltaic ( PV) power systems using solar cells\nto convert light directly. \n\n \n\nSome remote areas, such as Dupax del Norte, Nueva Vizcaya, had\nbeen using PV systems since 1994.\n\n\nOne &peso;1.5 million PV project benefitted 100 households. \n\n \n\nEstablishing a Philippine Solar Energy Society, a local chapter\nof the international group, may further unite the efforts of the PV industry\nand the government to come up with an effective promotion and\ncommercialization program. \n\n \n\nAlready, automation, better designs and improved manufacturing\nhave pulled down PV prices significantly. \n\n \n\nAfter all is said and done, OSW development is a must to enable\nthe Philippine energy sector to \" pole-vault &rdquo; into the 21st\ncentury, DOE emphasized. \n\n \n\nTowards this end, DOE plans to create a fund to establish a\nsystem allocating exclusive areas for OSW development over the short term.\n\n\n \n\nThe system, which resembles the service contract scheme of oil\nand gas producers will open opportunities to the private sector.\n\n\n \" If the system is institutionalized the private sector\ncan apply for OSW service contracts within certain areas.\n\n\nIn this manner, we can also avoid conflicts in the right way, &rdquo;\n the energy undersecretary pointed out. \n\n \n\nTo bring down the costs of generating power through OSW, DOE also\nproposed to establish a center for research to tackle the problem. \n\n \n\nThe center will be funded from the agency 's &peso;300 million\nper year Special Energy Fund.\n\n\nAbout 25 percent of the fund will go to research and 25 percent for\nOSW development. \n\n \n\nOf course, many are still apprehensive that the Philippines\ncannot be as competitive as its ASEAN neighbors when it comes to energy\nexports. \n\n \n\nMalaysia, for instance is perceived to be more strategically\nlocated and more financially capable. \n\n \n\nSkeptics argued the Philippines has to learn to walk before it\nruns.\n\n\nFirst, it must satisfy its local energy requirements before even\ncontemplating such an ambitious export program. \n\n \n\nWhile DOE conceded these concerns are serious it maintained that\nfocusing on OSW systems provides the Philippines with the technological and\neconomic advantage to gear up to become an energy exporter in the future.\n\n\n \n\n \" If the country pursues its pole-vaulting program\nnow, it will have the superiority in energy technology and resources\navailability twenty years hence, &rdquo;  Balce argued. \n\n \n\nBy that time, its ASEAN neighbors will be scrounging for the\nfossil fuels that abound today.  \n\n\n\n\n  The Hero Within  \n\n\n  A teacher by the roadside  \n\n\n Ma. Agnes O. Prieto  \n\n \n\n \" SOME men see things as they are and ask, Why?\n\n\nGreat men see visions and ask, Why not? &rdquo;   \n\n \n\nMost people would look at the Philippine economy and ask, \n\" Why are we the poor man of Asia? &rdquo; \n\n\nPaul de la Cruz is one of the few who see what we could be and ask -\n- why not an industrialized countryside? \n\n \n\nMore important, De la Cruz does not just ask, he gives answers.\n\n\nA scholar in Japan for agro-industries and general technologies from\n1973 to 1975, he is teaching and implementing appropriate technology in the\n barrios  and  barangays  . \n\n \n\nDe la Cruz calls his approach \" \" roadside\ntechnology. &rdquo; \"\n\n\n \" People can just ask me questions and I can share my\nknow-how anywhere.\n\n\nI give lectures even just by the roadside:  \" Hindi ko\nkailangan ang pumunta pa sa malamig at malilim &rdquo;  ( I don't\nhave to wait to go to where it 's cool and shady).\n#> I give it to them right where and when they need it, &rdquo;  he\nexplains. \n\n\n  Helping farmers  \n\n \n\nSince he moved to Puerto Princesa City, Palawan in 1966, he has\ngiven formal livelihood training to 70  barangays  for free\nand informal instruction to thousands.\n\n\nHe is training a hundred housewives, fisherfolk and out-of-school\nyouth in agro-industrial technologies, particularly fruit and vegetable\nprocessing to maximize the output of the season. \n\n \n\n \" We have to look right where we are.\n\n\nThere is so much to be done in the rural areas, and we don't need\nsophisticated machinery that costs millions of pesos, &rdquo;  says\nDe la Cruz, who has invented post-harvest technology equipment that combines\ntractor and rice thresher functions.  \n\n \n\n \" Seventy-five percent of our farmers are unable\nto pay for their agri loans.\n\n\nThey 're unable to catch up because of their outdated methods.\n\n\nCan you imagine what will happen to them once GATT ( General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade) is implemented?\n\n\nWe have to build safety nets for them right away.\n\n\nThe only way they can be competitive is to utilize appropriate\ntechnology.\n\n\nActually we have these technologies.\n\n\nFor instance, the International Rice Research Institute has made\nrevolutionary breakthroughs in production, however we do not make use of\nthese. &rdquo;   \n\n \n\nOther neighboring countries have better appreciation of these\ntechnologies and we find ourselves importing a particular variety of rice\nfrom Thailand developed at IRRI in the ' 70s. \n\n \n\n  \" Ngayon barya na lamang ang kinikita ng\nmagsasaka &rdquo;  ( nowadays, what farmers earn is just small\nchange),  but that 's because there has been this gap between their\nmethods of production and efficient means of technology.\n\n\nEven such simple necessities such as farm-to-market roads are mostly\nunavailable.  \n\n \n\n  \" Burgis ang ating mga tractors, kailangan\nmaraming beses pasadahan ang ina-ani &rdquo;

 he says. \n\n \n\nDisillusioned, he sought greener pastures in the land of\npromise, Palawan. \n\n \n\nHis Gold Ore Ceramics on Isaub, down the national highway to\nAborlan, produces ceramic balusters, wall and floor tiles, water filters\nbuilt into designer water jars, pots and pans, decorative statues, light\nbricks for foundry and smelting plants, bricks for enfractory (\nconstruction), bricks for light housing materials whose weight he has reduced\nby 75 percent.\n\n\nThese bricks are baked in with spores that ensure an air-cooled\nenvironment. \n\n \n\nHe has also developed grass wall boards for low-cost housing\nwhich use the lowly  cogon  as construction material, roofing\nfrom coconut coir and tile cement. \n\n\n  Vision  \n\n \n\nDe la Cruz innovates in practically all fields, so long as the\nmaterial is indigenous.\n\n\nBanana is not only a source for chips ( he has devised a chip maker)\nbut also non-toxic latex which is excellent for school materials. \n\n \n\nHe has also formulated varnish which is heat resistant and can\nstand up to 150 percent boiling point, does not fade and is a good water\nseal.\n\n\nHe has devised an efficient soil preparation technology - - a soil\nneutralizer which kills mollusks and reduces the alkaline planting material,\nan organic insecticide and fungicide safe enough for humans to drink but\ndeadly for pests.\n\n\nHis organic fertilizer comes in pellet form which the wind or the\nwater cannot wash away. \n\n \n\nHe has supported the cooperative Aborlan Marketing Corp. , the\ncity government of Puerto Princesa, the  Kabisig  Movement and\ncountless other civic and individual efforts.  \n\n \n\n \" We can industrialize.\n\n\nWe can build small industries in the countryside which put to\nimmediate and efficient use our resources.\n\n\nTechnology just doesn't mean what is imported. ......we are\ndeveloping our industrial machineries, we can set up our standards for\nindustrialization. &rdquo;", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "413450ce-7110-4af8-8fd6-e91854c113fa", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.260238+00:00"}
{"text": "Outstanding Fruit Production Technologies  \n\n\n Zac B. Sarian \n\n \n\nDR. PABLITO Pamplona of the University of Southern Mindanao in\nCotabato can be justifiably proud of three packages of fruit production\ntechnologies that the agricultural research consortium that he heads had\ndeveloped in the last five years. \n\n \n\nHe presented these technologies at the 25th anniversary\ncelebration recently of PCARRD, the agency that coordinates research in\nagriculture, forestry and natural resources. \n\n \n\nOne of the simple but very practical technologies his group had\ndeveloped is the intercropping of   durian  \nunder tall coconut trees.\n\n\nHe said that this practice has already been adopted in about 3,000\nhectares.\n\n\nThe technology will be further utilized as some growers in the\ncoconut-producing provinces of Luzon have started to adopt the idea. \n\n \n\nThe technology, Dr. Pamplona emphasized, can make the farmers '\noperations profitable.\n\n\nHe pointed out that usually, a one hectare of coconut plantation would\nnet the owner only about &peso;15,000 a year.\n\n\nWith the   durian   intercrop, the profit\ncould increase to more than &peso;15,000 once the   durian \n trees become productive eight to 10 years after intercropping.\n\n\nAs the   durian   trees grow older, the\nnet income would become even bigger. \n\n \n\nDr. Pamplona noted that establishing a   durian\n  plantation under coconut trees is much cheaper than in the\nopen field because only minimal land preparation is required.\n\n\nMaintenance of the trees during their growing period is also less\nexpensive. \n\n \n\nThe intercropping technology is not limited to coconuts.\n\n\nDr. Pamplona and his colleagues have also perfected an equally\nprofitable scheme of intercropping   lakatan   banana\nwith   durian   .\n\n\nThis practice has already been adopted in about 2,500 hectares,\naccording to the fruit expert. \n\n \n\nHe said that   durian-lakatan  \nintercropping can produce an income of about &peso;100,000 per hectare in\njust one year after plantation establishment.\n\n\nThis means that the farmer does not have to wait a long time to\nrecover his investment.\n\n\nBesides the early income from the bananas, the shade that they\nprovide, the seedlings makes the   durian   trees\ngrow faster.\n\n\nThere is also less mortality among the   durian \n trees. \n\n \n\nThe other package of technology that Dr. Pamplona is very proud\nof is the production of what he calls Inarched Large Planting Materials (\nILPM) which enables growers to produce vigorous planting materials that will\nfruit in just three to four years.\n\n\nILPM are produced from large branches of fruit-bearing  \ndurian   trees which may otherwise be pruned off.\n\n\nHe said that the technology is now being extensively used by\nnurserymen and farmers, especially in Mindanao. \n\n \n\nAnother innovative   durian  \npropagation technique that the Central Mindanao consortium has developed is\nthe so-called Modified Bud Grafting or ( MBG).\n\n\nBuds from mature trees are grafted onto newly sprouted  \ndurian   seedlings.\n\n\nWith this technology, bud-grafted seedlings could be produced at a\ncost of only &peso;5 each. \n\n \n\nThese bud-grafted seedlings can be bought by farmers which they\ncould grow into large planting materials in two to three years before\nplanting them out in the field.\n\n\nThe MBG seedlings also have another advantage.\n\n\nBig numbers could be transported easily even to long distances as\nthey can be packed bareroot. \n\n \n\nDr. Pamplona said that the Cojuangco farm is now using the MBG\ntechnology to mass propagate a selected   durian \n variety from Malaysia which is said to be superior in productivity\nand eating quality to the top varieties from Thailand such as Monthong and\nChanee.\n\n\nCojuangco is planning to plant some 900 hectares of this Malaysian\nvariety in Davao. \n\n \n\nDr. Pamplona acknowledged the support of Sen. Nikki Coseteng in\nthe development of the MBG technology.\n\n\nHe said that Coseteng had provided some financial support to the\nproject from her CDF or countrywide development fund.\n\n\nAnother source of fund to develop the technology was the  \nGawad-Saka   Outstanding Scientist Research Grant which he got\nas a result of having been given the Outstanding Scientist award a couple of\nyears back. \n\n \n\nThe other outstanding package of technology that Dr. Pamplona and\nhis colleagues have developed is on the production of   lanzones\n  and its close relatives, particularly   Duku\n  and   Longkong   - - all\nbelonging to the  Lansium  family. \n\n \n\nGlobal Technology Search ( GTS) carried by Dr. Pamplona 's group\nduring the last five years led to the identification of superior technologies\nin   Longkong   and   Duku \n production in Thailand and Malaysia.\n\n\nOn-farm and adoption research by the Central Mindanao consortium\nrevealed that these technologies are effective in improving the production of\n  lanzones   in terms of increased yield,\noff-season fruit production, and better quality fruits. \n\n \n\nDr. Pamplona pointed out that when the practices used in Malaysia\nwere applied to   lanzones   in Kabacan,\nCotabato, the local   lanzones   became also very\nproductive. \n\n \n\nThe package of technology on  Lansium \nproduction include superior practices in irrigation, fertilization, pruning,\ncropping systems, off-season flowering and fruiting, control of pests and\ndiseases, and proper postharvest handling. \n\n \n\nReaders who may be interested to contact Dr. Pamplona can write\nto him at the University of Southern Mindanao, Kabacan, Cotabato.\n\n\nHis telephone: ( 0912)700-2360.  \n\n\n\n\n  Ranching the Sea  \n\n\n Zac B. Sarian \n\n \n\nTHE NEW frontier in food production now appears to be open\nsea--the less-sheltered areas of the sea that have been yielding less and\nless for capture fisheries. \n\n \n\nThis is the belief of Philip S. Cruz, a fisheries expert who has\nbeen developing innovative systems of fish culture.\n\n\nEarlier, he has devised an automatic fish feeder that makes feeding\none 's fish much easier and more economical. \n\n \n\nToday, he has come up with another major innovation that will\nenable producers to raise fish even in the less protected areas in the sea.\n\n\nThis is what he calls the Aquaranch Seacage System. \n\n \n\nHe points out that in the last 10 years, aquaculture got a boost\nin foodfish production with the development of pen and cage farming\ntechnology in lakes and marine waters.\n\n\nThis has effectively provided the much need fish supply already\ndwindling from capture fisheries. \n\n \n\nHe hastens to add, however, that serious problems have cropped up\nwith the burgeoning of fishpens and cages--the destruction of the environment\nas a result of overcrowding and the inevitable pollution.\n\n\nAnd he cites the fishkills and other environmental problems in Laguna\nde Bay, Bolinao in Lingayen Gulf, Pansipit River in Taal, Lake Sebu in South\nCotabato and others. \n\n \n\nThe overcrowding resulted because the preferred sites for\naquaculture are the well-sheltered areas.\n\n\nHowever, since such places are limited, farmers tend to flock in\nthese areas and overdevelop them.\n\n\nThis results in localized deterioration of water quality which means\nslower growth of the fish and prevalence of diseases, according to Philip.\n\n\nHe further explains that sheltered areas have less water movement,\nhence more prone to pollution. \n\n \n\nFocusing fishpen and cage culture in sheltered areas likewise\ncreates other problems.\n\n\nAside from environmental pollution, putting up the aquaculture\nstructures in sheltered areas will likely result in conflict with fishermen\nwho use the areas for fishing as well as sheltering their boats.\n\n\nIt could also run in conflict with the tourism industry as what has\nhappened at Hundred Islands in Pangasinan, according to Philip. \n\n \n\nHe strongly believes that for aquaculture to become\nneighbor-friendly and grow on a sustainable basis, fish farming activities\nhave to move to deeper and less sheltered waters.\n\n\nHere, he says, environmental impact is greatly reduced.\n\n\nWater quality is better, and conflicting resource use with other\nindustries is avoided. \n\n \n\nFish farming in such environments, however, requires special\nculture facilities that can withstand occasional strong wind and wave action.\n\n\nPhilip says that it is with this need that all-weather fish cages\nfrom Norway, Denmark and the US have found their niche locally.\n\n\nThese imported cages are rated for five to seven-meter waves.\n\n\nThey have been so impressive that in two years, nearly a hundred\nunits have been brought to the country for growing   bangus \n mostly in Luzon and a few in the Visayas. \n\n \n\nFish production in such cages has been very impressive.\n\n\nDepending on the size of the cage, fish operators usually harvest 20\nto 50 tons per cropping of three to six months.\n\n\nThe big problem, however, is the fact that such all-weather fish\ncages are very costly.\n\n\nOne cage, complete with nets and moorings, used to cost &peso;1\nmillion before the devaluation.\n\n\nWith the weaker peso, using the imported cages has become financially\nunattractive. \n\n \n\nPhilip, however, has come up with his own version of on\nall-weather cage that is as good as the imported variety but costs only half.\n\n\nThrough his own research and development and with the generous\nfinancial support of the Department of Science and Technology 's Technology\nApplication and Promotion Institute ( TAPI), he is now in the commercial\nstage of his Aquaranch Seacage System. \n\n \n\nPhilip 's seacage is based on the tested and proven circular\npolyethylene cage design from Europe now widely used worldwide.\n\n\nIt is engineered based on local farming experience and conditions\nemploying Computer-Aided Design technology for optimum durability and\neconomy. \n\n \n\nUnlike the conventional rigid cages, Philip 's seacage utilizes\ntwo concentric Ultraviolet ( UV)-stabilized polyethylene tubes as floats\nwhich provide unparalleled flexibility and at the same time strength when\nexposed to strong wind and wave action.\n\n\nA four-point mooring system keeps the cage facility safely in place\neven under harsh weather conditions.\n\n\nAs an added safety precaution, all flotation tubes are foam-filled.\n\n\n \n\nThe stanchions of the seacages are made of stainless steel for\nmaintenance-free use.\n\n\nIt is designed, moreover, to be easily replaceable on-site should\nfuture upgrades be desired.\n\n\nThe cage uses only knotless nylon which is more durable and less\nabrasive to the cultured fish, Philip emphasizes.\n\n\nA special design also keeps the net fully open even under fairly\nstrong currents. \n\n \n\nA standard feature of Philip 's seacage is the automatic fish\nfeeder which is vital in ensuring rapid growth and efficient feed conversion.\n\n\nAll critical raw materials used in the various components of the cage\nsystem are imported and are specifically adapted to marine environments. \n\n \n\nHis first two cages with a diameter of 15 meters have been\ninstalled along the large channel separating Samal Island and Davao City.\n\n\nWith each cage having a water volume of about 1,200 cubic meters, a\nstocking density of 60,000 is expected to yield 20 to 30 tons of fish per\ncropping of three to six months. \n\n \n\nAside from   bangus   , other species\ncould be cultured in Philip 's seacages.\n\n\nThese include   lapu-lapu   , salmon, trout,\nbass (   apahap   ) and blue-fin tuna.\n\n\nIn Taiwan, fish culturists are raising more than 50 species of marine\nfishes in cages.\n\n\nThere 's no reason why it can't be done in the Philippines.  \n\n\n\n  Transporting the Mother  Bangus  Live\n \n\n\n Zac B. Sarian \n\n \n\nONE of the problems in   bangus   culture\nis the erratic supply of fry.\n\n\nSometimes the catch from the wild is plentiful and so there would be\nno problem about fingerlings.\n\n\nBut then there are times when, for one reason or another, there is no\nsource of fingerlings because the fry catch from the wild is insufficient.\n\n\n \n\nThe lack of fingerlings for stocking can be a big problem because\nthe cost could shoot up, and many of the fishponds could not be fully\nutilized.\n\n\nSo much lost opportunity is incurred. \n\n \n\nThe solution being eyed is to produce the fingerlings in\nlaboratories or hatcheries so that the supply of fry could be assured\nthroughout the year.\n\n\nWell, the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center has for some\nyears now developed the technology to spawn the   bangus \n in captivity.\n\n\nIn fact, the center is already producing a limited number of\nfingerlings in their hatchery in Tigbauan, Iloilo. \n\n \n\nThe government has been keen in producing fingerlings in\ncaptivity to ensure a steady supply of the same.\n\n\nThis way, year round   bangus   production\ncould be sustained for the benefit not only of fishpond operators but for the\ngeneral consuming public as well. \n\n \n\nThe problem has been in transporting live mother  \nbangus   for breeding in the hatchery.\n\n\n  Bangus   is a very sensitive fish.\n\n\nSoon after it is caught from the water, it dies.\n\n\nSo, how do you transport the live fish to distant places? \n\n \n\nThere 's now a way to transport live   bangus \n .\n\n\nAt the exhibit during the 10th anniversary of PCAMRD ( Philippine\nCouncil for Aquatic and Marine Research and Development), we met Prof.\nVirgilio A. Dureza of the UP Visayas College of Fisheries and fisheries\nconsultant Valeriano L. Corre, Jr. who updated us on their research regarding\nthe long distance transport of   bangus   broodstock.\n\n\n \n\nThe technology was actually adopted from Indonesia where \n bangus   fingerling production has become some kind of a\nbackyard industry.\n\n\nA few years back, the Department of Science and Technology has\nembarked on a global technology search, and one of the results is this one on\nthe transport of live adult   bangus   . \n\n \n\nProf. Dureza, who explained to us the procedure, revealed that\nin all their trials involving the transport of mature   bangus\n  by boat and then through five to six hours of rough roads, the\nsurvival of the fish was one hundred percent.\n\n\nThere was not a single mortality. \n\n \n\nIn four different occasions, Corre and his colleagues\ntransported different batches of 25 to 105 pieces of   bangus\n  , each weighing from 2.5 to 3 kilos.\n\n\nThe fish came from the fishpond of Antonio de Sales in an island in\nAklan, so they had to be transported to the UP Visayas in Leganes, Iloilo, by\nboat to the Panay mainland and then by cargo truck for five to six hours\nthrough rough roads. \n\n \n\nThe transport of the live mother   bangus \n requires special attention which includes transporting during night\ntime, but this could be done as the researchers have proven. \n\n \n\nDureza and Corre said that before the milkfish broodstock from\nthe fishpond are caught for transporting, they are transferred to a supply\ncanal where they are held for at least one week without feeding.\n\n\nFish with empty stomach are less stressed during transport, they\nexplained. \n\n \n\nThe fish are scooped out of the holding canal and immersed in\nwater containing an anaesthetic to knock them out.\n\n\nThis facilitates handling and weighing of the fish.\n\n\nThe fish are then placed in a double plastic bag with pond water\ncontaining anaesthesia which will keep the fish calm until they reach the\nwaiting truck in the main road. \n\n \n\nThe fish are transferred to a canvass tank installed in the\ntransport truck containing sea water to reduce the salinity to about 19 parts\nper thousand.\n\n\nAbout 15 to 52 kilos of live   bangus   may\nbe placed per cubic meter of water in the canvass tank. \n\n \n\nThe water temperature in the canvass tank should also be lowered\nto 26 degrees Celsius by adding crushed ice.\n\n\nThe water is checked every 30 minutes during transport so the\ntemperature could be adjusted accordingly. \n\n \n\nWhen the fish reach their destination after five to six hours,\nthey are transferred to a temporary holding tank where they are subjected to\nan antibiotic bath for one to four hours.\n\n\nAeration is also maintained throughout the period. \n\n \n\nAfter that, the fish are scooped out from the temporary holding\ntank and again anaesthetized.\n\n\nThey are again placed in a double plastic bag for their final\ntransport to the breeding pond, which in the case of their experiment, was\none kilometer away. \n\n \n\nAt the pond site, the fish are taken out from the plastic bag\nand held at swimming position in the pond water.\n\n\nThey are then held at the base of the caudal fin and swayed sideways\nuntil they regain equilibrium.\n\n\nThis makes the fish ready for release, Dureza and Corre said. \n\n \n\nSurely, this new technology borrowed from Indonesia will go a\nlong way in ensuring the availability of   bangus  \nfingerlings if the government or private sector will put it to good use.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "339244ef-e3cb-43ab-8a5d-15bba00a7663", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.261630+00:00"}
{"text": "Reinventing the S&T program in the Philippines  \n\n\n Rodel G. Offemaria \n\n\n  ( First of three parts)  \n\n \n\nScience and technology ( S&T) for economic growth is the\ngovernment 's rallying theme in its turn-of-the-century vision of achieving a\nnewly industrialized country ( NIC) status in next decade. \n\n \n\nAmid the current hoopla over a visibly resurgent economy, the\ngovernment, in the long term, is counting on its S&T development capabilities\nto finally shrug off the country 's economic  pariah  tag\nin the Asian tiger neighborhood. \n\n \n\nThe catching up game might have taken the form of a baby leapfrog,\nbut the impressive growth performance is facing imminent threats and\nchallenges following the country 's accession to the 120-member World Trade\nOrganization ( WTO). \n\n \n\nA WTO membership means freer exchange of goods and services among\nmember countries. \n\n \n\nGlobal trends also indicate a steady shift to knowledge-intensive\nwealth creation and trade activities that demand competitiveness and force\nhigh value-added innovations in technology industries such as electronics,\ncomputer hardware and software, communications, materials science and\nbiotechnology. \n\n \n\nThis indicates that the Philippines is marching into a fiercely\ncompetitive 21st century trade environment with a very short four-year gap\ninto the vision of industrialization for the country by the year 2000. \n\n \n\nWithout an aggressive S&T build-up, the country could find itself\nagain an insignificant bystander in the opulent WTO grab bag. \n\n \n\nAfter missing the NIC train in the ' 70s and having wrestled with\nthe political turbulence of the ' 80s, the government is pinning its future\nto the Department of Science and Technology ( DOST) to jump-start its S&T\ndevelopment master plan. \n\n \n\nThe objective is to catch up with the more progressive Asian\neconomies including Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea.\n\n\n \n\nBut S&T in the Philippines is an erratic affair despite a\nreputation as the show window of western influence in Asia.\n\n\nTo begin with, there was never an S&T blueprint for the country until\nthe 10-year S&T Master Plan ( STMP) was instituted in 1990 under the Aquino\nadministration. \n\n\n  STRATEGIES  \n\n \n\nUnder the STMP, the DOST-led development strategies are:\n\n\n*modernization of the production sector through massive technology\ntransfer from local and foreign sources;\n\n\n*upgrading of research and development ( R&D) capability through\nintensified activities in high-priority areas, and\n\n\n*development of S&T infrastructure including institution and manpower\nbuild-up and promotion of S&T culture. \n\n \n\nIn less than three years, the Ramos administration further\ndefined the STMP by  \" refocusing efforts on the leading edges\n&rdquo;  identified earlier. \n\n \n\nDuring the first multisectoral forum on S&T held in January 1993,\nPres. Ramos pushed for the Science and Technology Agenda for National\nDevelopment ( STAND). \n\n \n\nIt is aimed at  \" teaching Filipinos to use\ntechnology to enhance our skills and optimize productivity to give us greater\naccess to and control of our resources in people and nature. &rdquo; \n\n\nSTAND 's primary goals are to modernize agriculture and achieve full\nindustrialization of this sector. \n\n \n\nUnder the six-year STAND, the government expects to raise export\nlevel to &dollar;30 billion, achieve a per capita income of &dollar;1,000,\nand reduce poverty incidence to 30% or lower. \n\n \n\nLatest statistics from the National Economic and Development\nAdministration, however, show the per capita income level last year was\n&dollar;1,090, breaching the &dollar;1,000 target three years ahead of\nschedule.\n\n\nIt was impressive enough considering the figure was only &dollar;630\nin 1988. \n\n\n  ELECTRONICS  \n\n \n\nGovernment data also show that the country shipped out some\n&dollar;705 billion worth of electronic products which is nearly 50% of the\ncountry 's 1995 export receipts. \n\n \n\nThe STAND formula hinges on tapping private sector participation,\nuse of emerging technologies ( microelectronics, laser, biotechnology,\nmaterials science and information technology), manpower build-up,\nS&T-friendly policies, networking with other line departments,\nnon-governmental organizations and private institutions. \n\n \n\nBy linking with the mainstream industries and  academia\n , STAND hopes to spur a hotbed of technological activities. \n\n \n\nThe local electronic industry, although thriving, is largely\ndominated by foreign electronic giants which build assembly plants here to\navail of generous investment incentives and quality and affordable labor.\n\n\n \n\nScience and Technology Secretary William Padolina said \n\" achieving global competitiveness and NIC status means a bid to\nincrease production of world-class elaborately manufactured goods and to\nprovide world-class services. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nHe further added that this  \" translates to having\nthe policy and regulatory environment, human capability, and physical\ninfrastructure to enable us to deliver such goods and services at the right\nprice, quality and time. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThe capability to add value to goods and services is now the\nbasis for competitiveness.\n\n\n \" It is now clear that economic development is not\nachieved by increased infusion of labor and capital income alone but by\nimproving efficiency and productivity, &rdquo;  Mr. Padolina added.\n\n\n \n\nMr. Padolina suggested the government should lead a shift to what\nAlvin Toffler ( of \"  Future Shock  \" fame) calls\n\" \" third wave, &rdquo; \" or knowledge-based economic\ndevelopment approach. \n\n \n\nUnder a \" \" third wave &rdquo; model \" ,\nlabor and capital are no longer the sole basis of an economy 's comparative\nadvantage. \n\n \n\nIt now includes the stockpile of knowledge and information\nenhanced by a combination of timely intervention and state policies \n\" whose positive effects have accumulated over time. &rdquo; \n\n\n \n\nThe \" third wave &rdquo; revolution, in effect, sets the\nPhilippines on a drastically altered internal and external conditions\ncompared to those experienced by the neighboring NICs. \n\n \n\nUnlike in the ' 50s, the Philippines today cannot pin its hope on\nan economic miracle from a basically agro-industrial development initiative.\n\n\n \n\n \" It can't be the Taiwan or the South Korea model.\n\n\nIt has to be a special plan considering RP peculiarities, &rdquo;\n Mr. Padolina pointed out. \n\n \n\nMr. Padolina believes the country 's  \" niche right\nnow is in computer software development, design and production. &rdquo;\n\n\n\nCurrent UN estimates put the global software market at a staggering\n&dollar;200 billion while the Philippines ' current participation is placed\nwithin the &dollar;60-&dollar;70 million range. \n\n \n\nBut Mr. Padolina said the long walk to the multibillion-dollar\nsoftware market can start off by developing a local customized software\nindustry catering mainly to education, including software for teaching\nimprovement, which is a  \" very, very large market &rdquo;\n considering the country 's million student population. \n\n \n\nOn the other hand,  \" we continue to be\ntechnologically strong in agriculture.\n\n\nIt 's just that when it comes to implementation, the equation is\nincomplete and compounded by a tough environment that is biased against\nagriculture, &rdquo;  Mr. Padolina observed. \n\n \n\nSuch an equation imbalance can be solved in part by \n\" connecting the agriculture sector to the process industry which\nreally adds value to our relatively unprocessed agriculture products, &rdquo;\n he added. \n\n\n  MANPOWER  \n\n \n\nS&T authorities believe the Philippines can indeed attain global\ncompetitiveness because of several factors.\n\n\nA Hong Kong-based consultancy group in a 1994 study ranked the\ncountry first in Asia in terms of available educated, English-proficient\nmanpower. \n\n \n\nLabor cost here is also competitive by Association of Southeast\nAsia Nations ( ASEAN) standards.\n\n\nWorkers in electronics manufacturing for instance get an average\nmonthly pay of less than &peso;4,000 ( &dollar;140) while engineers receive\naround &peso;15,000 ( &dollar;600). \n\n \n\nBut overall, the problem with the country 's S&T development\nprogram remains the low capital outlay in Pesos, which in 1995 stood at only\n0.19% of the gross national product ( GNP), with 85% of this still\ngovernment-funded. \n\n \n\nBrain drain is also a big problem.\n\n\nLocal scientists and highly trained technical manpower have either\nmigrated to the more prosperous countries or are serving foreign projects\noverseas. \n\n \n\nThe Philippines also ranked a distant 35th of the 48 nations in\nterms of \" third wave &rdquo; capabilities surveyed by the World\nEconomic Forum, the lowest in ASEAN. \n\n \n\nA reality check dictates the Philippines should invest at least\n1% of its GNP to R&D activities based on United Nations standards. \n\n \n\nA more liberal incentives scheme for private R&D activities, such\nas special tax and low-interest loan packages and technology\ncommercialization assistance can help slow down the brain drain syndrome.\n\n\n \n\n \" In the past, S&T had been marginalized and the\ncumulative effects of such neglect are now felt.\n\n\nBut these are not insurmountable because creative S&T-based solutions\nand policy reforms can provide the needed help, &rdquo;  Mr. Padolina\nsaid.  \n\n\n\n\n  S&T needs govt't, private sector support  \n\n\n Rodel G. Offemaria \n\n\n  ( Third of three parts)  \n\n \n\nIsaac Bashevis Singer, 1978 Nobel Prize winner for literature, in\none of his memorable essays wrote,  \" If ever our situation is\ngoing to be improved, no novel will do it, and no poetry and no story. \n\n\nIt will be done by scientists, by technology, maybe by some good\npoliticians. &rdquo;   \n\n \n\nIn the Philippines ' science and technology ( S&T) development\nexperience, it appears more of the good politicians are necessary to strike a\nhealthy balance to achieve the desired improvement. \n\n \n\nS&T, as integral basis of national economic development, became\npart of the official state policy framework only under the 1987 Constitution.\n\n\n \n\nThis led to the creation of the Department of Science and\nTechnology ( DOST) through Executive Order 128 issued by former President\nAquino on January 30, 1987. \n\n \n\nThe DOST is tasked to \" energize &rdquo; research and\ndevelopment ( R&D) using current local, indigenous technologies and absorb\nforeign technologies. \n\n \n\nAt the same time, the country 's S&T manpower base is being\nexpanded mainly through the 1994 science scholarship law which aims at\nproducing some 3,500 science scholars annually. \n\n \n\nThe government also hopes to add another 1,600 highly trained\nscientists, engineers and science teachers from 101 high schools, 19\nengineering schools and 10 colleges with an &dollar;85-million loan support\nfrom the World Bank and Japan 's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund. \n\n \n\nA combination of global technology search program and S&T\nadvisory councils ( STACs) organized by the Department of Foreign Affairs in\nkey cities abroad is also being pursued.\n\n\nThe STACs are manned by Filipino scientists and engineers to monitor\ninternational S&T developments. \n\n \n\nTwenty foreign-based Filipino experts have returned to the\ncountry under the  Balik  - Scientist program since its\nrevival in 1994.\n\n\nThe program provides incentives to attract migrant scientists who\nwant to work and share their expertise with the local science community. \n\n \n\nIn brief, the DOST wants to link R&D to industries while creating\na \" critical mass &rdquo; of S&T personnel.\n\n\nThis was started aggressively since 1990  \" to enable\nthe Philippines to attain the status of a newly industrializing country by\nthe year 2000. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nBut just how serious the government 's industrialization program\nis plainly explained by the money muscle DOST is given for the last six\nyears. \n\n \n\nDOST 's 1996 budget of &peso;3.395 billion is a distant 13th\nplace among 19 departments, although a budgetary leap is likely to happen\nnext year.\n\n\nThe average annual DOST budget from 1991 to 1996 is only about\n&peso;2.4 billion.\n\n\nBut just as a point of comparison, this is even less than a\nsingle-year R&D expenditure of American computer software giant Microsoft\nwhich spent nearly &dollar;100 million in 1993 alone. \n\n \n\nHowever, if next year 's allocation is included, it will\ntranslate to a tidy 37% annual increase since 1991. \n\n \n\nOn top of this and in spite of generous tax incentives allowed\nunder Executive Order 226 issued during the previous administration, Board of\nInvestments records show that for the eight-year period covering July\n1987-July 1995, private sector R&D investments amounted only to &peso;594\nmillion, or roughly &peso;74 million annual average. \n\n \n\nThe DOST study revealed the government undertakes as much as 85%\nof all R&D programs in the country as of last year. \n\n \n\nMeanwhile, as early as 1993, the share of R&D expenditures in\nGross Domestic Product ( GDP) in the Philippines was so low ( 0.21%) compared\nto South Korea ( 2.23%), Singapore ( 1.12%). Malaysia ( 0.37%) and Indonesia\n( 0.26%). \n\n \n\nDOST Secretary William Padolina said,  \" the science\ncommunity in the Philippines today consists of 15,910 scientists, engineers,\ntechnicians and auxiliary personnel involved in R&D &rdquo; \nprojects. \n\n \n\nLocated in 449 identified institutions, the bulk of the S&T\ncommunity is in government, or 12,144 ( 76%) while 3,766 ( 24%) are in the\nprivate sector. \n\n \n\nBut if the Philippines is to industrialize, the size of the\nscience community must expand to at least 29,640 or 380 per one million\nFilipinos compared to only 155 in 1992, a study of the United Nations\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization shows. \n\n \n\nThese shall be composed of 6,909 postgraduates, 1,380 masteral\nand 3,447 college degree holders with R&D specialization and another 6,892\ncollege graduates in science and mathematics on top of 10,338 technical\ncourses-trained personnel. \n\n \n\nMr. Padolina noted that there 's a  \" shortage of\nscientists in the fundamental disciplines of chemistry, physics, and\nmathematics but a relatively large pool for biology. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThe country 's engineering education system which produces an\nestimated 30,000 each year also needs a thorough review because the skills\nproduced  \" are not responsive to industry requirements\nespecially in engineering design, &rdquo;  Mr. Padolina added. \n\n \n\nNotwithstanding the many constraints,  \" the DOST\nsystem has developed technical competence in the fields of biotechnology,\nmeteorology, medical and marine sciences, geothermal energy, volcanology,\nplant breeding, coconut production and utilization. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nExcept for notable research advances made in biodegradable\nplastics and thin-film rechargeable batteries which are potential sources of\nmegabucks when finally commercialized, most of technologies developed by DOST\nare predominantly in agriculture, forest products and aqua culture. \n\n \n\nIn a technology-based international trade set up, even the most\nsophisticated pest-resistant fruits, embryo-cultured   macapuno\n  and sex-reversed  tilapia  are no match to\nsimple electronic telecommunications equipment computer parts and software.\n\n\n \n\nA cursory list of the Philippines ' \" export winners\n&rdquo; continue to be garments, fashion accessories, assembled electronic\nproducts, computer software, toys, gifts, house ware, fresh and processed\nfruits, shrimp, tuna, sea weeds, furniture, marble products and ornamental\nplants. \n\n \n\nThe Philippines, meanwhile, continues to pump out dollars for\nimported power generation machineries, telecommunication and transport\nequipment, chemicals, fuel, lubricants and synthetic textile yarns - - all\nproduced by industrialized trade partners, a DOST study shows. \n\n \n\nAgain, with the exception of the crude  jeepney  ,\nthere is hardly any other steel-plastic-rubber Filipino S&T creation as\nwidely and productively used everyday in an economy composed of more than 65\nmillion people or roughly 11 million households.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "e95d2615-d8ce-48b5-8620-778f7a3062c8", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.262981+00:00"}

but it is certainly farther\naway from the former.\n\n\nAt least for the Philippines, our retarded growth into the computer\nage may be a real blessing. \n\n\n  Mainframe  \n\n \n\nSome reliable facts to console the fearful are as follows.\n\n\nMost of the problem is confined to the so-called mainframe world of\nbig clunky machines running ages old legacy software, like rural banks and\nthe government and its various institutions.\n\n\nHere the problem is one of management, not a technical one, since the\ncomputer clocks can be set forward to the doomsday date and the system\nchecked out for apocalyptic Armageddon. \n\n \n\nYou have a real problem if you truly rely on government computers\nfor anything, but that 's true with or without Y2K.\n\n\nThere 's no real problem if you use personal computers and\ncommercially available software, unless you inherited it all from your\ngrandfather 's accountant.\n\n\nAs for your toaster burning the house down just as you 're popping\nchampagne bottles two New Year 's Eves from now, you really need to get a\nlife if you 're worrying about that. \n\n \n\nAnother thing to consider is that the world is already up to its\nears in computer-related snafus.\n\n\nOne doesn't have to wait till the end of the millennium to suffer\nfrom the scourges of incompetent software, non-complying firmware and errant\nhardware.\n\n\nJust visit your local bank or ATM on any given day.\n\n\nY2K may be just a convenient way for the information technology\ndepartment to justify bloating its staff, hiring outside consultants,\nexpanding its power and management covering up all the buggy, substandard\nsoftware they 've allowed to be produced. \n\n \n\nJust watch, everything that goes wrong with computers after 1999\nwill be blamed on this Y2K humbug.\n\n\nSomething like this happened at the end of every century.\n\n\nIt 's our   fin de siecle   (\nend-of-cycle) reincarnation of the Antichrist, wearing a pocket-protector.\n \n\n\n\n\n  Caught in the Web: An unfinished history of the Internet\n \n\n\n Herminio L. Santos Jr. \n\n \n\nTHE Internet was founded in 1969 by the Pentagon as a secure\ncommunications system in case of a nuclear war.\n\n\nComputers of one establishment were connected - - or networked - - to\ncomputers in another establishment, thus providing a two-way exchange of\ndata. \n\n \n\nBut even before the cold war ended, Internet ( \" \" the\nNet &rdquo; \" ) not only provided information for defensive\npurposes, it also provided information to anyone interested.\n\n\nIt now links more than 20 million computers in more than 100\ncountries, and the number is doubling every year.\n\n\nFor some, the Net is a black hole of information, viruses, hackers,\nand perverts.\n\n\nFor many users though, it 's a lifeline, a living web, a highway to\nthe rest of the world. \n\n \n\nTapping to the Net 's vast resources can lead to a sudden\ninformation glut.\n\n\nMany of the information providers are individuals, and most of the\ntime, there 's no telling if what you find are hard facts, mere opinions, or\noutright lies.\n\n\nTo list all the databases available online would use up the rest of\nthis column, but a few examples might give you a hint of the capabilities:\nmore than 4,000 medical journals with more than seven million references, the\nfull text of several encyclopedias, items on rap music, and more than 800\nbusiness magazines and newsletters.\n\n\nHowever, news about Internet buying rights to the Pope and sleazy\nX-rated graphics also abound. \n\n\n  Messages  \n\n \n\nIn the Net, virtual communities exist.\n\n\nYou can exchange electronic mail ( e-mail) with other people.\n\n\nInstead of calling people and getting infuriating busy signals and\nvoice-mail boxes you simply send them messages through the phone lines, and\nyou 're assured that person will have a written copy of your message.\n\n\nYou can, for example, send questions and opinions to the president of\nthe United States.\n\n\n( Whether or not he answers them is another matter altogether). \n\n \n\nYou can also chat online, that is, send and receive messages in\nthe keyboard equivalent of a conversation.\n\n\nTopics range from business deals to setting up blind dates.\n\n\nOne popular news group, alt.support.depression only posts topics that\ntalk about - - you guessed it - - depression.\n\n\nSubjects covered are dubious therapists, insurance claims, and\ndreaded family reunions. \n\n\n  Marriage  \n\n \n\nThis new mode of communication is brought about by the\ntechnological advances in, and the marriage of, telephone, television, and\ncomputers.\n\n\nAll three contain the essentials for building the data network.\n\n\nSoon, the fine line dividing the three may no longer be visible. \n\n \n\nThe telephone system provides a switched, two-way form of\ncommunication that enables users to communicate with other users.\n\n\nTelevision has multiple video channels with high-capacity bandwidth\nnecessary to carry huge amounts of information such as video and audio.\n\n\nA new cable developed by AT&T can carry 80 gigabytes per second, or\nabout 2000 TV channels simultaneously per fiber.\n\n\nComputers provide the nerve center for everything.\n\n\nThey control storage, manipulation and distribution of the data.\n\n\nPowerful computers with speed, lots of memory, and huge amounts of\nstorage space are already being developed, if not already here with us. \n\n \n\nThe trick, however, lies not in combining these technologies, but\nin making these available to the most number of people.\n\n\nProblems arise. \n\n\n  Issues  \n\n \n\nFirst, logistics.\n\n\nNot many telecommunication companies worldwide have the capability to\nset up the satellites and the billions of kilometers of optical fibers needed\nby the Net.\n\n\nEven if the technology is here with us, the capital isn't.\n\n\nMoreover, going online is not cheap.\n\n\nThe hardware needed ( computer, telephone line, modem, the works),\nalthough still expensive, is fast becoming more affordable.\n\n\nYou can buy decent machines for less than US&dollar;2,000.\n\n\nBut the long distance charges are murder.\n\n\nAnd once you get caught in the Net, the phone charges pile up quite\nfast. \n\n \n\nFear brought about by lack of training is also a problem.\n\n\nFor most people, computers still bring images of nerdy hackers\nwrestling with serpent-like technology.\n\n\nAlthough some people say that the computer has virtually become just\nanother household appliance, it 's still not as every day and as easy to use\nas a toaster.\n\n\nToo often, computers gather dust because people don't know what to do\nwith them.\n\n\nMost computers are still being used as overqualified calculators and\ntypewriters.\n\n\nIn schools, computers are still kept in a separate room, which is\nusually called the \" \" computer lab, &rdquo; \" thus\nfurther isolating the machines from the mainstream learning environment.\n\n\nComputers are still thought of as an end to itself, and not as a\npowerful tool for discovering other things. \n\n\n  Fear  \n\n \n\nMoreover, many people fear that computers will render them, and\nthe current technologies they 're comfortable with, useless.\n\n\nBut will computers render teachers and television obsolete?\n\n\nProbably not.\n\n\nWhoever thinks that students can be left caught in the Net and learn\neverything by themselves is in for a rude awakening because as in any trip to\nan unknown land, guides are necessary.\n\n\nAs for television, it 's a matter of taste: While some may prefer\ntelevision they can talk back to, others either simply can't afford the new\ntechnology, or will still want current TV 's passive mode of entertainment.\n\n\n \n\nRoles and responsibilities, however, will definitely be\nredefined.\n\n\nThe Net, for example, will do to TV what TV did to radio a couple of\ndecades ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast November 1994, in Tokyo, I attended NHK 's 21st Japan Prize\nContest, which is a competition for educational TV programs from all over the\nworld.\n\n\nIn one of the seminars I attended, participants discussed television 's\nfuture.\n\n\nSome said that multimedia and the Information Superhighway will not\nradically change television.\n\n\nTelevision will remain the same dictatorial medium it has been for\nthe past decade: here are the programs, take it or leave it.\n\n\nNo interaction.\n\n\nThe only choice the audience makes is switching stations. \n\n \n\nBut the contest used to have a category for educational radio\nprograms.\n\n\nIn 1969, Professor Schramm of Stanford University said the rapid\ndevelopment of TV did not mean that radio as an educational tool has faded\naway.\n\n\nHe added that TV 's popularity does not change the fact that radio\nstill served as one of the important educational media in any country.\n\n\nIn 1991, due to lack of entries, the radio category was abolished.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "9034fcb3-8c81-4e9a-b68a-8d3460c45243", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.264185+00:00"}
{"text": "What you should know about laser for poor eyesight \n\n\n\n Marge C. Enriquez \n\n\n  First of two parts  \n\n \n\nTHE past few months, three centers with new equipment for\ncorrecting myopia or nearsightedness were launched in Metro Manila.\n\n\nThe Excimer laser refractive surgery alters the cornea 's shape and\nenables the patient to get rid of his corrective lenses forever. \n\n \n\nPreviously, patients with high refractions had the option to\nundergo surgical radial keratotomy ( RK).\n\n\nThe doctor slits the cornea with the knife - - at the risk of\nperforating it and causing complications. \n\n \n\nNow comes photorefractive keratectomy ( PRK) or corrective laser\nsurgery, which has been proven to be safer.\n\n\nThe Excimer Laser is a \" cold &rdquo; shortwave laser used to\nreshape the curvature of the cornea in the procedure known as PRK, the\nresults are believed to be precise and uniform. \n\n \n\nDuring exposure, the beam removes micron-thin layers of corneal\ntissue which is less than half the thickness of the human hair.\n\n\nContact time is only a millionth of a second.\n\n\nNo heat is generated.\n\n\nCalculation and execution are done with the aid of a computer.\n\n\nMeasurements are highly accurate and the results are predictable.\n\n\n \n\nPRK is performed at the Institute of Refractive Laser Surgery in\nAlegria Bldg., Pasong Tamo Ext., Makati City.\n\n\nThe institute was founded by a group of leading Filipino eye\nsurgeons, with the support of experts in medical laser technology. \n\n \n\nThe group includes Drs. Cosme N. Naval, Salvador R. Salceda, Ma.\nPhoebe Lim-Catipon, Alexander Joseph L. Reyes, Edgardo T. Aguirre, Jimmy L.\nDinglasan, Sabino A. Santos Jr., Jose Gabriel A. Santos and Glenn P. Abundo.\n\n\n \n\nThe Summit Refractive Laser Center 's Eye Referral Center also\noffers medical laser technology services. \n\n\n  What is myopia  \n\n \n\nAccording to Dr. Julian Pancho S. Garcia,  \" The\nerror of refraction arises primarily from eyeball size.\n\n\nFor myopics, the eyeball is too large that the focus is only in\nfront.\n\n\nIt doesn't reach the retina.\n\n\nTo minimize the length, we remove portions of the coat of the cornea\nso your focus will reach the maximum. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nWho can undergo laser surgery?\n\n\nThe patient should be at least 20 years old, have a stable\nrefraction, and not have corneal disease or glaucoma. \n\n \n\nDiabetics, hypertensives, contact-lens wearers who have developed\ncomplications or can no longer tolerate lenses are also suitable for this\nsurgery. \n\n \n\nLaser surgery is performed first on one eye.\n\n\nThe second operation is performed only after the first has healed.\n\n\n \n\n \" The public should know that this is not an\ninstant thing, &rdquo;  says Dr. Garcia Jr.\n\n\nAlthough healing takes up to six months, the patient must have\nregular follow-up examinations up to the second year after the operation.\n\n\n\n  20 minutes  \n\n \n\nBefore surgery, contact lens wearers should remove their lens,\ntwo days for soft lens, a week for hard lens.\n\n\n \" The important thing is to get an accurate refraction\nbecause the results would hinge on it.\n\n\nThat 's what you feed on the computer which calculates the number of\nshots it 's going to fire,\"  says Dr. Garcia. \n\n \n\nHe explained the procedure at Eye Referral Center.\n\n\n \" Step 1, take a good refraction; Step 2, do specula\nmicroscopy ( have the state of the cornea photographed by a machine); and\nStep 3, the procedure. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nIt takes 15 to 20 minutes to prepare the patient for the\noperation.\n\n\nThe doctor applies gel on top of the patient 's cornea and fires the\nlaser to make him feel what will happen.\n\n\nThe gel is then removed and laser is fired on the cornea. \n\n \n\nIn the second stage of the familiarization, the patient\nexperiences the smell and sound of the actual operation.\n\n\nThe computer calculates how many shots the patient needs for the\ncornea. \n\n \n\nThe laser sounds like a clackety typewriter that \ncrescendoes  .\n\n\nThe smell is similar to when one is having a dental cleaning.\n\n\nOnce the doctor determines that the patient can fixate his cornea, he\nactivates the laser. \n\n \n\nIt takes only 30 to 45 seconds to remove the epithelium - - the\nthin, outer layer of the cornea. \n\n \n\nAfter the procedure, the patient wears an eye patch and rests for\n24 hours to ease tearing.\n\n\nThe patient will experience either discomfort or tearing for three\ndays.\n\n\nThen, he or she can resume normal activities. \n\n \n\nContact lens is usually worn on the other eye if one has a high\nrefraction. \n\n \n\nWhile healing, the patient must religiously apply eye medications\nand see the doctor to determine how he reacts to the surgery. \n\n\n  Possible complications  \n\n \n\nAlthough the doctor will aim for zero or normal vision in\ncorrecting the refraction, patients will react differently to the surgery.\n\n\n \n\nAccording to a study of the patients with refraction of 200 to -\n600, half were able to have 20/20 or normal vision.\n\n\nTwenty-five percent either had a grade of + or - 50, ( far or\nnear-sighted).\n\n\nAbout 20 percent reported + or - 100.\n\n\nIt is more difficult to predict the results of people with higher\nrefraction. \n\n \n\nThere is also the risk of overcorrecting.\n\n\n \" Let 's say you 're a minus - 8, and we correct that.\n\n\nIdeally we should get +75 or +1 after the procedure.\n\n\nWhy the plus?\n\n\nBecause if you 're down to no grade, once you heal, the cells will\nregenerate.\n\n\nBecause you removed the superficial layer, the cornea thickens again.\n\n\nThe hyperoptic sheet is thinner than the expected result.\n\n\nAs it heals, it goes back to the ideal thickness, &rdquo; \nsays Dr. Garcia. \n\n \n\n \" The other complication is possible corneal haze,\ncloudiness.\n\n\nBut it is more a problem for the doctor, unless the patient can feel\nit. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nBlindness is a question that pops up immediately.\n\n\nBut only one case had been reported.\n\n\nA drug addict underwent the procedure but did not put the\nantibiotics.\n\n\nHe developed secondary infection and underwent corneal transplant.\n\n\n \n\nOther complaints would include discomfort or feeling of a foreign\nbody in the eye and two or three days of tearing. \n\n \n\nPatients with astigmatic correction aside from myopia might need\nadditional surgery.\n\n\nAnd those over 40 years old will still need reading glasses. \n\n \n\nEye Referral Center offers laser surgery at the introductory\nprice of &peso;12,000 to &peso;15,000 per eye, depending on the refraction,\nuntil October.\n\n\nIf the patient went through the normal healing process and ended with\na grade of - 200, the repeat procedure becomes part of the package.\n\n\nIn Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia, it 's offered for\nUS&dollar;1,200.\n\n\nIn the States, it ranges from &dollar;1,500 to &dollar;2,500 per eye.\n\n\n\n  Three centers  \n\n \n\nBefore undergoing surgery, prospective patients should be\nfamiliar with the different brands of refractive laser surgery. \n\n \n\nOphthalmologist Timothy Elbert Tan explained that the Excimer\nLaser uses two inert substances that don't normally synthesize: argon and\nfluorine.\n\n\n \" If you put them in a closed container and apply\nenergy, they come together and get excited dimers.\n\n\nWhen you release energy, they release the photon which is used in\nsurgery. &rdquo; \n\n\nThus the name, Excimer. \n\n \n\nEye Referral Center was the first to introduce the pioneer brand,\nSummit.\n\n\nThirteen patients have tried the surgery at Eye Referral Center and\nare said to be happy about the results. \n\n \n\nThe Institute of Refractive Laser Surgery followed with the\n Technolas Keracor  116 by the German group Chiron\nTechnolas.\n\n\nThe American Eye Correction Center will soon introduce the VisX\n20/20. \n\n \n\nOf the 800,000 refractive laser surgeries done worldwide, 500,000\nwere done using the Summit brand.\n\n\nThe laser works from the middle to the cornea and reaches outward.\n\n\n \n\nThe American VisX 20/20 was originally an industrial laser used\nto etch silicon chips.\n\n\nIt was later modified for the delicate medical surgery.\n\n\nWhen fired, the laser moves in a concentric circle, from the larger\narea of the cornea to the inner. \n\n \n\nThe  Technolas Keracor  116 slits laser beams\naround the cornea, which takes a longer time and may cause inflammation,\ndepending on the patient 's condition. \n\n\n  Don't be misled  \n\n \n\nDr. Tan warned that prospective patients should not be misled by\nclaims that the surgery is painless, fully guaranteed and that the laser\nbrand has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. \n\n \n\nThe procedure itself may be painless, but not after it.\n\n\n \" All procedures cause inflammation because healing\nrequires it, &rdquo;  said Dr. Tan.\n\n\n \" Anything medical can't give a 100-percent guarantee.\n\n\nWhat guarantee?\n\n\nThat you won't go blind or that your grade will be zero or much\nlower? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n Technolas Keracor  and VisX 20/20 are still\npending approval from the USFDA.\n\n\nSummit 's photo therapeutic keratectomy laser for corneal diseases\nhas been approved by the USFDA, while its photo refractive keratectomy laser\nwill get the nod in October.\n\n\nSummit is used for clinical trial in France, Canada, Japan and the\nUS.\n\n\nIt has been quite successful in Britain, Germany, Spain, Korea,\nSingapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Middle East, Greece and Italy. \n\n \n\n \" I 've been following this technology since 1991.\n\n\nThe procedure has been polished and the results better over the\nyears, &rdquo;  said Dr. Tan. \n\n \n\nAnother common query is how many surgeries the ophthalmologist\nhas performed.\n\n\n \" It 's like the usual question for any other manual\nsurgery.\n\n\nThey 'll want to know how many the doctor has done.\n\n\nThat 's their gauge of how good the doctor is.\n\n\nIn this procedure it 's different.\n\n\nThe experience relevant here is refraction and minor surgery,\n&rdquo;  said Dr. Garcia. \n\n \n\n \" In the surgery itself, the important thing is\nthe doctor is there to assist and make sure the patient fixates on the light.\n\n\nOnce the patient starts moving we take our foot off the pedal.\n\n\nIt 's really a treatment modality that requires minimum physician\ntraining. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nAdded Dr. Tan,  \" This is one procedure where the\npatient makes the decision from the facts given by the doctor. &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\n On Sunday: the American Eye Correction Center.  \n\n\n\n\n\n  An alternative source of energy  \n\n\n Fern Zalameda-Lansang \n\n \n\nWaste-to-energy ( WTE) technology, as the term implies, is a\nmass-burn process that transforms garbage or municipal solid waste into steam\nor electricity. \n\n \n\nWaste-to-energy facilities effectively complement the\ntraditional waste management methods, particularly recycling.\n\n\nIn many industrialized countries, recycling has been a main feature\nof waste management efforts, but they depend on waste-to-energy technology\nfor disposing the greater bulk of their refuse.\n\n\nJapan is a very ardent proponent of recycling yet it still combusts\n70 percent of the waste that remains after recycling.\n\n\nThe Netherlands and Denmark are similarly noted for the high success\nrate of recycling but each combusts 40 percent to 60 percent respectively, of\nwhat remains.\n\n\nThese facts reveal that a sizeable amount of combustible materials\nare left behind even after the most dynamic execution of recycling. \n\n \n\nWTE is not a new technology, having its predecessor in the old\ngarbage incinerators that environmentalists had frowned upon, due to the\ntoxic gases these incinerators released into the atmosphere. \n\n \n\nTime, talent, research and development, however, have made it\npossible for a highly upgraded, efficient, safe, and affordable WTE that has\nbeen successfully adopted in several countries.\n\n\nThus, environmental safety is ensured using state-of-the-art\nemission control technology that cleanses combustion gases before they are\nreleased into the atmosphere. \n\n \n\nHow does the facility work?\n\n\nEssentially, recyclables are first sorted out and what remains are\nbrought by collection trucks to the facility site.\n\n\nA typical operation is described as follows:   \"\nRefuse collection trucks are weighed at the scalehouse and inspected for\nsafety.\n\n\nOnce cleared, they enter the tipping building and dump their waste\ninto the storage pit.\n\n\nAn overhead crane mixes the waste in the pit and lifts the waste up\ninto a feed chute leading to the furnace.\n\n\nFrom the feed chute, waste is pushed by hydraulic ram feeders onto\na stoker grate.\n\n\nThe grate bars push upward against the natural downward movement of\nthe waste bed.\n\n\nThis constant movement ensures that the burning waste is\ncontinually agitated and pushed back, thus serving as underfire for\nfreshly-fed waste.\n\n\nA forced draft fan supplies the primary combustion air underneath\nthe grate.\n\n\nIn addition, overfire is injected through the front and rear walls\nof the furnace. \n\n \n\nInside the steel tubes that form the furnace walls and the\nboiler, heat from the combustion process converts water to steam.\n\n\nThe superheater further heats the steam before it is sent to a\nturbine generator to produce electricity.\n\n\nAfter passing through the boiler sections, the hot combustion gases\nare used to preheat boiler feed water in the economizer.\n\n\nWhile the combustion gases move through the boiler, the bottom ash\nslowly makes its way to the end of the grate where it falls into the water\nquench through.\n\n\nFrom the boiler, the cooled gases enter the advance air pollution\ncontrol system.\n\n\nUsing lime slurry, the dry scrubber neutralizes any acid-forming\ngases, such as sulphur oxides and hydrogen chloride.\n\n\nNext, particulates are captured by a high-efficiency electrostatic\nprecipitator or a baghouse.\n\n\nAs the gas stream travels through the filter devices more than 60\npercent of particulate matter is removed.\n\n\nCaptured fuel ash particles fall into hoppers and are transported\nby an enclosed conveyor system to a discharge where they are wet to prevent\ndust and mixed with the bottom ash from the grate.\n\n\nThe ash residue is then conveyed to an enclosed building where it\nis loaded into covered leak-proof trucks and taken to a landfill designed to\nprotect against groundwater contamination.\n\n\nAsh residues from the furnace can be processed for removal or\nrecyclable scrap iron.\n\n\nAll aspects of the plant 's operation are monitored from a central\ncontrol room 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. &rdquo;", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "42619216-5dc4-4797-91cd-39d14b9cfb7f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.265263+00:00"}
{"text": "Microsoft marches on  \n\n\n Manuel A. Alcuaz, Jr. \n\n \n\nFor all intents and purposes the Office Suite wars are over.\n\n\nMicrosoft has won with an overwhelming 80 to 90% market shares.\n\n\nNovell is now shopping around for someone to buy its WordPerfect\nOffice business unit.\n\n\nAnd Lotus, now owned by IBM, is looking for market niches for the\nLotus Office suite.\n\n\nMicrosoft Office consists of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Schedule.\n\n\nMicrosoft Office Pro consist of the above plus Access. \n\n \n\nJust a few years ago WordPerfect was the number one word processor\nand Lotus 1-2-3 was the number one electronic spread sheet.\n\n\nHarvard Graphics was the leading presentation software, Lotus\nOrganizer was the leading personal information manager. \n\n \n\nMicrosoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint were good products but they\nwere not the market leaders.\n\n\nIf Microsoft has gone one on one against the leaders in each\nproductivity tool category it would have been a long bloody war with no\nassurance of victory much less dominance. \n\n \n\nMicrosoft 's strategists saw that its major strength was in\nhaving a combination of products to meet office productivity needs.\n\n\nThe competitors had excellent individual products but did not have a\nfull set of tools to meet office productivity needs. \n\n \n\nMicrosoft saw the opportunity and launched the Microsoft Office\nsuite at a price that no one else could afford.\n\n\nMicrosoft Office did not cost two or three times the price of an\nindividual tool.\n\n\nIt cost only slightly more than any one tool ( Word, Excel, or\nPowerPoint).\n\n\nThus buyers opted for Microsoft Office over combinations of its\ncompetitor tools.\n\n\nFurthermore, when WordPerfect and Lotus responded with their own\noffice suites they came in multicolored boxes.\n\n\nA situation which would make it very hard to give the impression of\nseamless integration between the tool categories. \n\n \n\nMicrosoft has made seamless integration its major competitive\nweapon.\n\n\nIt always fascinates me to watch a Microsoft demo of Project.\n\n\nThe emphasis of the demo is not the scheduling of activities on the\nGantt or PERT charts.\n\n\nThe emphasis is on how the project manager can quickly prepare a\nprogress letter to the project owners and seamlessly embed a summary project\nschedule chart using OLE ( object linking and embedding) or how the project\ncost data can be transferred to an Excel spread sheet to do a budget analysis\nand show the varieties using Excel 's charting capabilities. \n\n \n\nNow that Microsoft has established dominance in office\nproductivity tools, it is now ready to take on the MIS market which has long\nbeen the turf of system vendors and database and application development tool\nvendors. \n\n \n\nMicrosoft has a two-pronged strategy to conquer this market.\n\n\nTo attack the database segment Microsoft has the Back Office.\n\n\nThe Back Office consists of six servers - - Windows NT Server, SQL\nServer, SNA Server, Mail Server, and coming soon, Exchange Server. \n\n \n\nWindows NT Server is Microsoft 's multipurpose network operating\nsystem.\n\n\nIt provides a combination of file print, client/server database and\ncommunications services.\n\n\nIt combines the functionality of Novell NetWare and UNIX in a single\nsystem.\n\n\nWindows NT can coexist with existing NetWare and/or UNIX system.\n\n\nIt is rapidly eroding Novell 's NetWare installed base and the UNIX\nvendor 's market base. \n\n \n\nDigital Equipment seems to be back.\n\n\nIt had a very strong presence at COMDEX.\n\n\nAlmost all their systems were running Windows 95 or Windows NT.\n\n\nI kidded the Digital sales people at the booth about what happened to\nVX/VMS, Ultrix, and Open VMS.\n\n\nThey pointed out that somewhere in the many booths they had an Alpha\nrunning VMS.\n\n\nIt is quite clear that the Digital comeback is anchored on the fact\nthat the Alpha is the most powerful processor running on NT. \n\n \n\nSQL Server is Microsoft 's scalable high-performance relational\ndatabase management system designed for distributed client/server computing.\n\n\nSQL Server was originally identical to Sybase SQL Server.\n\n\nA few years back Microsoft and Sybase agreed to part ways and\ndifferentiate their products because Sybase could not follow Microsoft\nhigh-volume, low-cost market strategy. \n\n \n\nSQL Server Version 6.0 is definitely an in-house Microsoft\nenhancement.\n\n\nAmong its key enhancements are: built in data replication; parallel\nprocessing enhancements; GUI distributed management tools; and superior\nintegration with Windows NT and other back office products. \n\n \n\nA number of market analysts expect Microsoft SQL Server to\novertake Oracle by 1998. \n\n \n\nSNA Server provides connectivity to IBM AS/400 and mainframe\nsystems.\n\n\nSystem Management Server supports e-mail and Microsoft Exchange\nSupport workgroup computing. \n\n \n\nThe other segment which Microsoft is now attacking is application\ndevelopment.\n\n\nMicrosoft 's key business palliation development products are Access\nand Visual BASIC. \n\n \n\nAccess and FoxPro are Microsoft 's leading desktop database\nproducts.\n\n\nFoxPro was the industry leading DBMS.\n\n\nAccess is Microsoft 's product for the future.\n\n\nWhile FoxPro had market share, Access had a newer relational DBMS\narchitecture.\n\n\nMicrosoft built up ACCESS market share by making it a part of\nMicrosoft Office Pro. \n\n \n\n\" Access \" is actually a multi - purpose\nproduct.\n\n\nIt is now the best PC and LAN database management system because it\ncombines ease of use and relational DBMS functionality.\n\n\nIt was  PC Magazine  's Editor 's Choice in the last review\nof PC DBMS, a position formerly occupied by MicroRim 's R:Base.\n\n\nIt is also an excellent query and reporting tool for accessing data\nstored in its own files or in other database.\n\n\nAnd now an excellent application development tool for client/server\nsolutions. \n\n \n\nThe Access Developer 's Toolkit presents a serious threat to\nPower Builder.\n\n\nAmong its key features are: OLE Controls; Replication Manager; Office\nCompatibility kit; Visual BASIC for Applications; Forms Design; Performance\nand Table Analyzer Wizards; and Enhanced Jet Engine. \n\n \n\nVisual BASIC has grown from being a GUI version of Quick Base.\n\n\nVisual BASIC is now the common programming language for three key\nMicrosoft products--Excel, Project and ACCESS.\n\n\nVisual Basic for applications is bundled with each of these products.\n\n\n \n\nVisual Basic is an object-based programming language.\n\n\nAlthough OOP purists will not accept it as a full object-oriented\nlanguage, it boasts the world 's largest and fastest growing library of\nrebuilt VBX and OLE components. \n\n \n\n\" Visual Basic \" comes in three versions:\nStandard Edition, Professional Edition and Enterprise Edition.\n\n\nAll three versions provide an easy to learn and use visual\nenvironment-based programming language and data access capabilities including\nan integrated database engine. \n\n \n\n\" Standard Edition \" is designed for power users\nwho want to quickly build Windows 95 applications.\n\n\n\" Professional Edition \" is designed for developers\nto build 16-bit and 32-bit applications and to build libraries of OLE\ncomponents. \n\n \n\n\" Enterprise Edition \" is designed for teams\nbuilding large client/server applications.\n\n\nIt supports the creation of three-tier applications.\n\n\nIt includes \" Source Safe \" , which manages source\ncode and enables multiple programmers to work together.\n\n\nFull ODBC support enables Visual BASIC applications to run with\nACCESS SQL Server and Oracle Databases. \n\n \n\nThe Microsoft steam roller is gathering momentum.\n\n\nI don't think that the Network Centric vision will stop it.  \n\n\n\n\n  New techno uses blood analysis as diet tool  \n\n\n Susan A. de Guzman \n\n \n\nBLOOD is blood--that red liquid flowing in your veins.\n\n\nBut scrutinized under a microscope and magnified on screen, it 's a\nmuch more interesting sight.\n\n\nThis up-close and personal view of so-called \" live blood\n&rdquo; shows organisms of varying shapes and sizes moving ceaselessly about.\n\n\n \n\nTo the untrained eye, this image may be nothing more than a\njumble of odd shapes and figures.\n\n\nBut to the health expert, this specimen is a valuable tool in\nassessing a person 's physical condition. \n\n \n\nA nutritional supplements company is now using this technology\nfrom the US--called \" live blood microscopy \" - - to analyze\na patient 's nutritional deficiencies or excesses.\n\n\nThis way, the nutritive problem can be easily identified and\naddressed with the help of enzyme-based supplements. \n\n \n\nUnlike an ordinary blood analysis which is quantitative, blood\nmicroscopy is qualitative.\n\n\nThe former keeps track of the number of the person 's white blood\ncells, red blood cells and platelets.\n\n\nThe latter indicates what condition those blood components are in.\n\n\nThe live blood demonstration, however, is for nutritional information\nonly and is not to be considered medical diagnosis. \n\n\n  Simple procedure  \n\n \n\nThe procedure itself is simple.\n\n\nBlood is obtained from the person through a finger prick.\n\n\nThis sample is placed on a slide.\n\n\nWhen examined under the microscope, the magnified version of the\nblood is projected on a TV screen. \n\n \n\n \" There is a big impact when people see for\nthemselves how their own blood looks like.\n\n\nWhen they see all these moving forms, they become curious and ask\nquestions about it.\n\n\nThrough microscopy, we can explain better what 's going on inside\ntheir body on a cellular level, &rdquo;  said Richard Glenn Ortega of\nBio-Enzyme Inc., which distributes the Infinity2 brand of nutritional\nsupplements. \n\n \n\n\" Bio-Enzyme \" has a chart indicating the normal\nappearance of various cells and cell groupings.\n\n\nAny aberrations are said to be symptoms of a particular affliction.\n\n\n \n\nTo drive home their point, they ask the patient to take enzyme\ntablets upon consultation.\n\n\nAfter a few minutes, a blood sample is taken again.\n\n\nWhat was shown before as a build-up of undigested food, for example,\ngradually disappears reportedly as a direct result of enzyme intake. \n\n\n  Enzyme supplement  \n\n \n\nIn another demonstration, Ortega breaks a capsule of enzyme\nsupplement into a cup of chocolate pudding.\n\n\nHe stirs it in, and in a matter of minutes, the jelly-like substance\ntransforms into almost liquid form--an indication that the enzyme helps\nquicken food digestion. \n\n \n\n \" We have a natural supply of enzymes in the body.\n\n\nThere are metabolic enzymes the body needs to run itself.\n\n\nThen there 's a limited supply of digestive enzymes which is put in\nyour 'enzyme bank account' at birth, &rdquo;  says Victor Chua, also\nof Bio-Enzyme Inc. \n\n \n\nEnzymes needed for proper digestion and absorption ideally comes\nfrom food.\n\n\nUnfortunately, research has proven that cooking, processing,\nirradiating, microwaving and other preservation techniques kill almost all of\nthe natural enzymes in food.\n\n\nAlso, it has been found that many raw foods today are\nenzyme-deficient, owing to the use of pesticides and other chemicals. \n\n \n\n \" Your body has to 'rob' enzymes from your\npersonal enzyme bank account and even use some of your metabolic enzymes, to\nattempt the digestive process.\n\n\nThis reduces the amount of these enzymes available for body\nfunctions, &rdquo;  Chua says. \n\n \n\nOrtega also notes the existence of \" free radicals &rdquo;\nin the body that, while essential particularly to the immune system, must be\ncontrolled by antioxidants.\n\n\nThe free radicals cause rapid oxidation of tissues and fats,\nresulting in tissue damage and premature aging if not controlled. \n\n\n  Dietary habits  \n\n \n\n \" It is very important that antioxidants be\ncomplete so that when they do their job opposing free radicals, the process\ndoes not result in the creation of more free radicals.\n\n\nNow, there 's a coordinated approach of using both vitamin and\nenzyme antioxidants together to prevent further free radical damage, &rdquo;\n says Ortega. \n\n \n\nAside from live blood microscopy, \" Bio-Enzyme\n\" asks the patient to fill up a questionnaire to assess his health\nbased on dietary habits, exercise routines and previous ailments.\n\n\n \" This health evaluation profile will help give a\ntotal picture of the patient 's lifestyle.\n\n\nBased on this, we can recommend a specific program suited to his\ncondition, &rdquo;  says Ortega. \n\n \n\nThe questionnaire is very detailed.\n\n\nFor starters, the person is asked what food he ate the day before\nand what his normal diet consists of.\n\n\nThere are over a hundred questions the person may answer \"\nno/never \" , \" yes/sometimes \" or \" often\n\" .\n\n\nThese queries include: Do you feel sleepy or have low energy after\neating?\n\n\nDo you have varicose veins or bruise too easily?\n\n\nDo you have trouble sleeping?\n\n\nDo you have cravings for sweets or sugars?\n\n\nAre you moody?\n\n\nHave you undergone any surgery within the last 90 days?\n\n\nDo you have ridges in your fingernails?\n\n\nDo you eat red meats?\n\n\nDo you smoke or are you exposed to second hand smoke or smog?\n\n\nDo you have excessive wrinkling of the skin?\n\n\nDo you experience bloating? \n\n \n\nOrtega singles out that feeling sluggish after eating is already\nan indication that something 's wrong inside.\n\n\n \" When you eat food, you should be energized.\n\n\nIf the opposite happens, you have to find out why. &rdquo; \n\n\n \n\nOrtega says they usually advocate a combination of changes in a\nperson 's diet, the implementation of an exercise program and the intake of\nnutritional supplements.\n\n\nHe enumerates,  \" One of the main principles is to eat\na minimum of 50 percent raw food.\n\n\nIdeally, there should be five servings of fruit a day and three\nvegetable servings a day.\n\n\nAs much as possible, we also encourage them not to eat fried food to\navoid fat intake.\n\n\nThe alternatives are to bake, broil, steam or roast food. &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\nHe adds,  \" As much as possible, they should make\ntime for exercise.\n\n\nThe common excuse people give is that they have no time for it.\n\n\nBut we tell them, they don't have to go to the gym to exercise.\n\n\nThey can do it right at home, even while watching television.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nBased also on their findings, they suggest a combination of\nsupplements for the patient to take according to his needs.\n\n\nThe Infinity2 range has five professional products and seven\nnutritional products. \n\n \n\nWhile the aforementioned comprise the general measures they\nadvise patients, Chua stresses evaluation is done on a case to case basis.\n\n\n \" We go for 'customized' treatment because it 's\nreally dependent on the person 's condition, &rdquo;  he explains.\n\n\n \" For example, he may have a health restriction which\nprevents him from eating the food we suggest or maybe from exercising.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nExpectedly, lifelong practices cannot be changed overnight.\n\n\nDr. Annie Damian-Relucio, \" Bio-Enzyme \" 's\nconsulting physician, says,  \" It takes 21 days to change a\nhabit.\n\n\nThis is why we have to monitor the patients closely and guide them\nas they go through their specific programs.\n\n\nWhen they strictly follow the program, they themselves notice the\ndifference in a matter of days. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nMaking the changes will reportedly improve the life span by some\n20 to 30 years, plus quality.\n\n\nNot only is the life span extended, says Ortega, but those\nadditional years will be lived still at optimum health. \n\n \n\nChua, however, insists that the health professional can only do\nso much in improving a patient 's well-being. \"\n\n\n \" On our part, we supply them with the information,\nhelp them to understand it, and let them know their options.\n\n\nIn other words, we give them the tools.\n\n\nWe educate then and motivate them.\n\n\nBut we may have the best products, we may give them the best advice,\nbut if they don't act on it,  wala rin  .\n\n\nSo in the end, it 's really up to the person. &rdquo;

{"text": "Biotechnology eyed to raise aggie \nproductivity  \n\n\n Lindablue F. Romero \n\n\n  ( First of four parts)  \n\n \n\nWITH the need to double food production as a result of the country 's\nrapid population growth, scientists and agriculture officials have set their\neyes on biotechnology to increase agricultural productivity. \n\n \n\n\" Biotechnology \" simply refers to any technique\nthat uses living organisms to make or modify a product, to improve plants or\nanimals, or to develop micro-organisms for specific uses. \n\n \n\n \" For an agricultural country like the Philippines,\nbiotechnology is bringing new dimensions and possibilities of improving\ntraditional agricultural practices, &rdquo;  said Reynaldo de la\nCruz, director of the National Institute of Biotechnology and Applied\nMicrobiology ( Biotech). \n\n \n\nBiotechnology may boost crop production through bio-organic\nfertilizers, biopesticides, use of diagnostic kits, growth-promoting\nsubstances and plant biotechnology, De la Cruz said. \n\n\n  Bio-organic fertilizers  \n\n \n\nThese types of fertilizers can be divided into three major groups,\nnamely: fertilizers from biological nitrogen-fixing organisms, mycorrhiza and\norganic fertilizers. \n\n \n\nAfter several experiments, scientists were able to isolate these\nnitrogen-fixing organisms that are now produced commercially by Biotech. \n\n \n\nBiotech has already produced commercially Nitro Plus fertilizer\nspecifically for such legumes as peanut, mungbean, cowpea, pole  \nsitao   and soybean.\n\n\nNitro Plus was made from the nitrogen-fixing bacterium rhizobium.\n\n\n \n\nAnother fertilizer commercialized by Biotech although it is still\non a limited scale is BIO-N which can be used for rice, corn and sweet\npotato.\n\n\nThis was made from the bacterium azospirillum isolated from the roots\nof the local grass otherwise known as   talahib   .\n\n\n \n\nAzolla, an aquatic fern which can fix atmospheric nitrogen into a\nform useful to plants can be used as an N-organic fertilizer for irrigated\nlowland rice fields.\n\n\nIt can also be used as feed supplement for poultry, duck and swine.\n\n\n \n\nNitrogen-fixing blue-green alga ( BGA), otherwise known as\ncyanobacteria, can be used to maintain soil nitrogen fertility, said De la\nCruz. \n\n \n\nHe said it is easy to popularize the use of BGA since it is\nabundant in the country thus, it can easily replace chemical nitrogen\nfertilizers especially in rice paddies. \n\n \n\nBiotech now produces commercially VAM ( vesicular-arbuscular)\ninoculants for many agricultural crops such as corn, upland rice, eggplant,\ntomato, soybean, peanut, mungbean; fruit trees such as papaya, citrus,\n guyabano  .\n\n\nThese are sold in powdered form ( Mykovan-1) or in granulated form (\nMykovan-2). \n\n\n  Organic fertilizers  \n\n \n\nFor the use of organic fertilizers, De la Cruz recommends\ntrichoderma technology which simply utilizes compost piles containing\nagricultural waste materials such as sawdust,  bagasse  ,\nrice and straw.\n\n\nThese materials will be inoculated with an activator containing pure\ncultures of trichoderma harzianum for rapid decomposition of the compost.\n\n\n \n\nThe use of this technology has resulted in the 15-25 percent\nincrease in rice grain yield compared with rice plants receiving full\ninorganic fertilizer rates.\n\n\nThis is equivalent to 13 cavans of rice per hectare during the wet\nseason and 15 cavans during the dry season. \n\n \n\nThe trichoderma-azotobacter technology is another alternative for\nuse by the farmers, said De la Cruz. \n\n \n\nHe said this involves initially the biodegradation of farm wastes\nwith trichoderma species.\n\n\nBefore full composting is attained, the decomposing heap is\ninoculated with strains of nitrogen-fixing bacterium known as azobacter. \n\n \n\nThis type of bio organic fertilizer has the advantage since large\namounts of potential substrates for organic fertilizer such as rice straw,\nrice hull, coffee hulls and animal manures are already in the farms. \n\n\n\n\n\n  Biotechnology eyed to raise aggie \nproductivity  \n\n\n Lindablue F. Romero \n\n\n  ( Second of four parts)  \n\n \n\nSCIENTISTS have set their eyes on biotechnology to increase\nagricultural productivity, especially with the need to double food production\ndue to Asia 's increasing population. \n\n \n\nBiotechnology is the technique of using living organisms to\nmodify a product, to improve plants or animals, or to develop micro-organisms\nfor specific uses. \n\n\n  Bioinsecticides  \n\n \n\nHarmful pests are now controlled mainly by the use of imported\nchemical insecticides.\n\n\nUnfortunately, there are many insects that have developed resistance\nto a number of chemical insecticides due to indiscriminate use.\n\n\nAside from this, frequent use of chemical insecticides may cause the\naccumulation of toxic substances in the environment that will pollute\nwaterways. \n\n \n\nDue to this, scientists have isolated the bacterium \n Bacillus thuringiensis   or Bt for the control of major\ninsect pests.\n\n\nDistributed worldwide, Bt produces toxins which can kill insect pests\nby contact or when ingested. \n\n \n\nReynaldo de la Cruz, director of the National Institute of\nBiotechnology and Applied Microbiology ( Biotech), said isolates of Bt had\nbeen found effective for such harmful pests such as the Asian corn borer,\ndiamondback moth, crucifers and six lepidopterous pests of rice like leaf\nfolder, green hairy caterpillar, green semilooper, rice caseworm, yellow\nstemborer and striped stemborer. \n\n \n\nDifferent formulations of bioinsecticides containing Bt strains\nare now available in Biotech. \n\n\n  Diagnostic kits  \n\n \n\nA more sensitive, accurate and faster method in detecting virus,\nvirus-like organisms, fungal and bacterial diseases is the use of monoclonal\nantibodies, De la Cruz said. \n\n \n\nAt present, the Bureau of Quarantine which regulates the\nintroduction of infected plants and plant parts from foreign sources still\nuses the traditional methods to detect diseases.\n\n\nIn most cases, they rely on the presentation of phytosanitary\npermits.\n\n\nAll traditional methods cannot detect the disease-causing organism\nuntil after the disease had already spread in epidemic proportions. \n\n \n\nThe use of monoclonal antibodies ( MAB) will allow the detection\nof papaya ring spot virus in different parts of the plants within 24 hours.\n\n\n \n\n \" MAB can detect plants with latent infection even\nif visual symptoms are still not evident, &rdquo;  said De la Cruz.\n\n\n \n\nAside from being environment friendly, this technique can\naccurately detect an infected plant material early enough to control\ndiseases, reduce production inputs and spread of pathogen to non-infected\nareas, he said. \n\n\n  Growth hormones  \n\n \n\nGrowth hormones extracted from fresh coconut water will promote\nthe growth and yield of plants such as   pechay   ,\nChinese cabbage, mungbean, soybean, peanut, sweet pepper and tomato under\ngreenhouse and field trials. \n\n\n  Plant biotechnology  \n\n \n\nThe Institute of Plant Breeding in UP Los Ba&ntilde;os, College\nof Horticulture and College of Forestry now conducts tissue culture or the\npropagation of plants from cells or tissues.\n\n\nCells and tissues obtained from various parts of the plants are\nplaced on specific medium containing salts, a carbon source, vitamins,\nhormones and other substances.\n\n\nProtocols have been developed for various plants such as bamboo,\norchids, pineapple,  camote  ,  ubi  ,\nbanana and  falcata  . \n\n \n\nLikewise, whole plants can now be regenerated from protoplasm\nisolated from callus cultures.\n\n\nScientists are now testing transgenic plants which are genetically\nengineered to accept transient genes from other sources. \n\n \n\nTransonic planting - - wherein the Bt endotoxin gene from\n  bacillus thuringiensis   is being transferred\nto corn,   pechay   and Chinese cabbage - - is now\nbeing done.\n\n\nThe main purpose is to come up with a plant containing the Bt gene\nwhich is resistant to attacks against pests such as the Asiatic corn borer\nand the diamondback moth. \n\n\n  Livestock production  \n\n \n\nBiotechnology could be used in three areas of animal production\nnamely: reproduction, health and nutrition. \n\n \n\nArturo S. Arganosa, acting director of the livestock research\ndivision of the Philippine Council for Agriculture, Forestry and Natural\nResources Research and Development said the enormous potential of\nbiotechnology offers better alternatives and options to improve livestock\nproduction and health. \n\n \n\nBiotechnology advances could have direct effects on the animal by\naltering its genotype, changing its interaction with the environment or by\nimproving the nutritive value of foodstuff.\n\n\nThrough bio technologies, Arganosa said more antibiotics could be\nused in animal feeding, better vaccines could reduce diseases, and growth\nhormones could be improved. \n\n \n\nOne biotechnique that has stirred the interest of many\nresearchers is the separation of sperm cells bearing X and Y chromosomes.\n\n\nThis attempts to make sex preselection of offsprings in farm animals.\n\n\nThe use of superior female animals may be extended after the\nprocedures for embryo manipulation has been established. \n\n \n\nAnother technique in reproductive biotechnologies refers to\nunderstanding the culture requirements of oocytes   in vitro\n  .\n\n\nThis allows the collection of immature oocytes from slaughtered\nanimals, their maturity and fertilization   in vitro \n , and their development to preimplantation stage embryos which can\nbe transferred to recipient animals. \n\n \n\n \" It therefore becomes possible to harness to\nmaximum efficiency those oocytes in the ovarian pool to produce better farm\nanimals, &rdquo;  said Arganosa. \n\n \n\nNuclear and gene transfers can also improve the livestock\nindustry by potentially reducing the generation interval and genetically\ntailoring animals that are economically important. \n\n\n  Biotechnology on  carabaos   \n\n \n\nGenetic improvement of  carabaos  is one component\nof the  Carabao  Development Program that will ensure the\nimprovement of quality of the local  carabaos  . \n\n \n\nLibertado Cruz, executive director of the Philippine \nCarabao  Center, said the concern for genetic improvement was due to\nthe fact that quality of local  carabaos  has declined during\nthe last decade due to inbreeding and natural selection biased against the\nlarge males. \n\n \n\nThis is because farmers tend to select bigger and better work\nanimals, and then render these animals castrated, making the good males\nunavailable for breeding. \n\n \n\nIn effect the quality of available bulls for natural breeding\nremains small and of undesirable quality.\n\n\nThe  carabao  program, said Cruz, focuses on the\njudicious selection of breeding animals of both the native stocks and the\ndairy breed, specifically the Murrah breed. \n\n \n\n \" In order for the program to enhance the\npropagation of highly selected and top performing animals of both types, the\nuse of newly emerging reproductive biotechniques is in order, &rdquo;\n said Cruz. \n\n \n\nThe gestation period of  carabao  is rather long\nas it takes about five years before the first calf is born.\n\n\nIt is also a very slow process because the  carabao \nunlike swine and other animals would only bear one calf per gestation. \n\n\n\n\n\n  Biotechnology use faces problems  \n\n\n Lindablue F. Romero \n\n\n  ( Third of four parts)  \n\n \n\nWHILE the government recognizes the importance of biotechnology\nin increasing agricultural production, there are so many constraints in the\nfull implementation of biotechnology research. \n\n \n\nThe National Economic and Development Authority recognizes\nbiotechnology as the brightest and best prospect for accelerating the country 's\ndevelopment. \n\n \n\nWilliam Padolina, science and technology secretary, is optimistic\nthat there will be significant progress within the next 10 years in\nagricultural biotechnology, especially in the introduction of transgenic crop\nplants with resistance to pests and diseases.\n\n\nTransgenic plants with improved nutritional qualities shall also be\navailable.\n\n\nThe research and development base for animal biotechnology shall have\nbeen established and work to improve the genetic makeup of local livestock\npopulations shall be started. \n\n \n\nBut the government has yet to provide full support to solve the\nconstraints on biotechnology. \n\n\n  Problems facing biotechnology  \n\n \n\nA World Bank research on agro-biotechnology development in the\nPhilippines said there is a lack of a feasibility study to give a clear\npicture of the demand for certain products and services.\n\n\nThis makes it difficult to evaluate how useful new biotechnology\nprocesses and products will be. \n\n \n\nReynaldo de la Cruz, director of the National Institute of\nBiotechnology and Applied Microbiology in UP Los Ba&ntilde;os, said the bulk\nof research efforts often end at the development stage of technology.\n\n\nThe commercialization aspect is often given less priority due to\nlimited mechanisms for operationalization. \n\n \n\nAt present, there is an apparent hesitation to risk investment in\nbiotechnology projects that require further development for\ncommercialization. \n\n \n\nAt the same time, De la Cruz said, researchers still lack\nadequate training and expertise in modern biotechnological techniques.\n\n\nIndepth training and exposure to new innovative techniques of\nmolecular biology and DNA technology are wanting, he said. \n\n \n\nResearch and development efforts have also been perceived as\ndiffused and lacking in focus, said Marichiel J. Navarro, university\nextension specialist of Biotech in UP Los Ba&ntilde;os.\n\n\n \" There is no clear understanding of individual\nactivities, interests, programs and expertise of each institute, &rdquo;\n said Navarro. \n\n \n\nBoth De la Cruz and Navarro said modern biotechnology work\nhinges on limited research and development facilities.\n\n\nStandard facilities for laboratory and pilot plants are expensive.\n\n\n \n\nOther problems facing scientists are the lack of effective\nmechanisms for technology transfer, limited access to information and\nambiguous, ineffective technology development policies.\n\n\nThe latter includes the lack of guidelines related to patent rights,\nlicenses, publication rights and confidentiality. \n\n \n\nWhile constraints seem inevitable, the commitment of the science\ncommunity, government support for research and development in biotechnology\nand the private sector interest will sustain the advances that have already\nbeen started. \n\n \n\n \" The potential for production systems to be\ntremendously improved and made more efficient exists.\n\n\nThe growing reality, however, is that the prospects for global\ncompetitiveness lie in the very technologies already developed for the local\nmarket, &rdquo;  said De la Cruz. \n\n\n  Issues on Biosafety  \n\n \n\nThe use of modern biotechnology in agriculture has raised\nconcerns about the new techniques because their potential power is so\nfar-reaching and the number of new products is so great. \n\n \n\nIt recognizes the importance of providing appropriate regulatory\nmechanisms to ensure that products made through the use of new techniques are\nas safe as the products of traditional biotechnology. \n\n \n\nA research report on Biosafety conducted by the International\nService for National Agricultural Research recommends five principles that\nmust be considered by national policy makers to ensure the safety of modern\nbiotechnology products:\n\n\n*Regulatory review should focus on the characteristics and risks of\nthe biotechnology product - - not the process by which it is created.\n\n\n*For biotechnology products requiring review, the review process\nshould be set up for efficiency and effectiveness while assuring the\nprotection of public health and environment safety.\n\n\n*Any additional regulatory requirements for new biotechnology\nproducts should be integrated into the overall regulatory system that governs\nthe release of new products in the agricultural sector.\n\n\n*Regulatory programs should be flexible and capable of adapting\nquickly to new knowledge and understanding produced by the rapid advances in\nbiotechnology.\n\n\n*To create opportunities for the application of innovative\nbiotechnology products, all regulations in environmental and health areas - -\nwhether or not they address biotechnology - - should use performance\nstandards than rigid controls or specific design requirements. \n\n \n\nBiotechnology regulation can be incorporated in existing\nlegislation to avoid creating a new regulatory infrastructure specifically\nfor this science.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "0d75deba-6d79-41e7-9efe-0b47f22e3081", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.268160+00:00"}
{"text": "Can libraries stay up to date?  \n\n\n Veronica C. Silva \n\n \n\nAuthor Nicholas Negroponte called his book \" \" Being\nDigital &rdquo; \" as being already obsolete the minute a reader gets\nhold of it. \n\n \n\nWhat Mr. Negroponte wanted to point out is the \" exponential\n&rdquo; change that is happening in society where \" bits, &rdquo;\ninstead of atoms like books, are becoming  \" dominant units of\nhuman interaction. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nDoes this mean then, that library books are already obsolete, too?\n\n\n \n\nNot atoms, but the lack of funds and resources are keeping books\nobsolete in Philippine libraries. \n\n \n\nA random check of libraries in Metro Manila indicate that the\ncomputerization or automation of the library system is in its infancy stage\nas admitted by some of the librarians interviewed by \"  Business\nWorld Online  \" .\n\n\nThese libraries include academic, specialized and public libraries.\n\n\n \n\nIn the book \" \" The Electronic Trail:\nComputer-Assisted Research and Reporting in the Philippines, &rdquo;\n\" the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism listed the\nso-called electronic libraries which are either on-line libraries that can be\naccessed remotely, or libraries that use library software for their\noperations. \n\n \n\nBut upon inspection, \"  Business World Online \n\" found that not many libraries have fully automated their\noperations to make it easier for researchers to retrieve the information\ngathered.\n\n\n\n \n\nMany of the Philippine libraries are electronic in the sense that\nthey use electronic access tools like CD-ROM databases or the Online Public\nAccess Catalog ( OPAC). \n\n \n\nCD-ROM databases and OPAC can be easily implemented with\nstand-alone computers like the case of the University of the Philippines (\nUP) Diliman Main Library. \n\n \n\nDe La Salle University ( DLSU), on the other hand, recently\nopened its CD-ROM network where researchers can simultaneously access some\nCD-ROM databases. \n\n \n\nBoth libraries and many other libraries in the Philippines are\nusing the UNESCO ( United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization)-distributed CDS-ISIS ( Computerized Documentation\nSystem-Integrated Set of Information Systems), currently a text-based\nsearchable database of bibliographic information. \n\n \n\nIn these libraries, researchers still need to go physically to\neach library to access their collections. \n\n \n\nOnly a few are on-line with the bibliographic databases\naccessible via the Internet. \n\n \n\nThe more notable on-line library network is the science and\ntechnology ( S&T) electronic library network of eight universities nationwide\nunder the World Bank-funded Department of Science and Technology-Engineering\nand Science Education Program ( DoST-ESEP). \n\n \n\nThe ESEP schools include UP Diliman, UP Los Ba&ntilde;os, UP\nManila, DLSU, Ateneo de Manila University, University of Sto. Tomas,\nUniversity of San Carlos and Mindanao State University-Iligan Institute of\nTechnology. \n\n \n\nUsing CD-ISIS and sometimes an integrated library system software\nlike the TINLIB ( The Information Navigator for Libraries System), the\nbibliographic information under the ESEP network can be accessed via the\nInternet. \n\n \n\nThrough documentation services available from these libraries,\nresearchers can access the actual materials for a fee. \n\n \n\nThe trend towards the computerization or automation of library\nsystems has been noted in the Philippines and worldwide since the 1980s. \n\n \n\nA 1986 UP thesis pointed out this observation in the country\nwhile foreign literature support this observation. \n\n \n\nThe UP study revealed that 29 out of 223 libraries and\ninformation centers studied have developed or have been using computerized\nsystems while 55 are planning to use computers.\n\n\nHowever, the  \" general trend is computerization &rdquo;\n with the number of libraries using computers \" doubling\n&rdquo; within one to two years, the study added. \n\n \n\nThis study indicates that the Philippine library system is not\nbad considering that an American observer also noted that online library\nsystems have become a \" reality &rdquo; only in the 1980s after eluding\n \" library automators for two decades, &rdquo;  said\nDavid C. Genaway in his 1984 book on online library systems. \n\n \n\nThe culprit, as in the case these days, are the resources. \n\n \n\nHowever, Philippine libraries are not far behind other sectors or\norganizations that are only getting automated in a world where everything is\ngoing bits and electronic.\n\n\nIn fact, some companies have only started computerizing lately. \n\n \n\nFinancial and personnel problems were identified in the UP study\nas the factors that affect the implementation of library automation plans.\n\n\n \n\nMr. Genaway described it as  \" sporadic,\nunsystematic efforts &rdquo;  as early as the 1960s. \n\n \n\nSaid Richard De Gennaro in 1976:  \" There are\nindications that the advent of powerful and inexpensive minicomputers and\nstorage capabilities will lead to the revival of this concept ( of library\nautomation) in the next few years. &rdquo;  \n\n\n  ATTEMPTS  \n\n \n\nDLSU director Perla S. Garcia recounted that the earlier attempts\nof DLSU to computerize in the 1980s involved a minicomputer which gave them\ntechnical and maintenance problems. \n\n \n\nThe same goes for the UP Diliman Main Library which used two\nmainframe computers in the 1970s, said UP College of Science ( CS) librarian\nLourdes T. David in an interview with \"  Business World Online\n \" . \n\n \n\nThe savior is the microcomputer or the personal computer ( PC)\nthat was introduced in the 1970s. \n\n \n\nThe successful implementation of the UP Diliman and DLSU library\nsystems are now being run in PCs or mid-range systems such as Unix-based\nsystems. \n\n \n\nGiven the limited resources, the librarians themselves will be\nthe first to tear down the walls that keep researchers distant from the\nsources of information. \n\n \n\nIn UP, it was not until ESEP, UNESCO and the first Internet\naccess facility in the Philippines that the UP Diliman CS and College of\nEngineering ( CoE) became automated and on-line. \n\n \n\nThrough UNESCO funds, the UP Diliman CS and CoE installed a fiber\noptic cable network to interconnect the two libraries, said Ms. David. \n\n \n\nLater, through the PHNet, the first Internet connection of the\nPhilippines supported by the DOST, the two UP libraries got on the Internet.\n\n\nThis network is now known in UP as the DilNet. \n\n \n\nHowever, the UP Diliman Main Library, the \" mother &rdquo;\nof all libraries in one of UP 's autonomous universities, only started its\nInternet connection early this year, said Africa Castillo, Main Library head\nof cataloging and computer services. \n\n \n\nThe National Library ( TNL), the mandated repository of\nPhilippine collections and the \" mother &rdquo; of all public\nlibraries, is awaiting telephone lines to enable them to connect to the\nInternet, said its director Adoracion Mendoza-Bolos. \n\n \n\nMany of the librarians interviewed by \"  Business\nWorld Online  \" admitted that they are just starting out with\ntheir computerization such that only a few components of the on-line library\nsystem or minimal computerization is already in place. \n\n \n\nWhile TNL has started its computerization in 1995, it is using\nits TINLIB ( The Information Navigator for Libraries) for cataloging and\nretrieval. \n\n \n\nTINLIB is an integrated library system that incorporates the\nlibrary functions in a fully automated system.\n\n\nThe components of TINLIB are cataloging and retrieval, acquisition,\ncirculation and serials management. \n\n \n\nNational Library data furnished \"  Business World\nOnline  \" showed the TINLIB database contains 100,845 records.\n\n\n\n  PRIORITIES  \n\n \n\nMs. Bolos added that TNL is prioritizing 1995 to current data to\nbe included in the databases.\n\n\nConsidering that the Philippine national library system has been\nexisting since the 1900s, then TNL still has a long way to go. \n\n \n\nTNL recently launched its Public Information Library Network (\nPUBLIN) which will interconnect the public libraries in the country.\n\n\nThe implementation started with the distribution of PCs with library\nsoftware to 20 public libraries in Luzon and the training of librarians from\n18 of these recipient libraries, said Ms. Bolos. \n\n \n\nTNL is currently facilitating the bidding of PCs for distribution\nto public libraries in Mindanao. \n\n \n\nBut these initiatives are meager considering that the number of\npublic libraries nationwide is less than two percent of the number of\nlibraries that are supposed to be established in the different \nbarangays  , municipalities, cities and provinces. \n\n \n\nRepublic Act 7743 of 1994 mandates the establishment of\ncongressional, city, municipal libraries and  barangay \nreading centers. \n\n \n\nTNL data showed that of the 41,139  barangays  ,\nthere are only 206 reading centers and out of the 1,526 municipalities, there\nare only 474 municipal libraries. \n\n \n\nFunding government-run libraries is obviously a problem. \n\n \n\nTNL being an attached agency of the Department of Education,\nCulture and Sports ( DECS), it is not surprising to find out that it has\nfinancial problems even when it comes to upgrading its resources into\nautomated systems. \n\n \n\nEven with the DECS ' public school computerization program, which\nhad been getting legislative support by way of special appropriations, DECS\nofficials consider these appropriations a drop in the bucket. \n\n \n\nFor instance, for the 1996 computerization program, only 624\npublic high schools out of the 40,000 public elementary and high schools are\nexpected to benefit. \n\n \n\nEqually having financial difficulties are the National Economic\nand Development Authority ( NEDA) Library in Pasig and the UP Diliman Main\nLibrary. \n\n \n\nThe NEDA library only started this year the computerization of\nits operations using the UNESCO CDS-ISIS ( Computerized Documentation\nSystem-Integrated Set of Information Systems), said library services chief\nEllen Salvatierra. \n\n \n\nMs. Salvatierra cited the lack of funds as the reason why it is\nautomating late because the NEDA library does not get additional funds aside\nfrom the regular budget. \n\n \n\nRecently, the NEDA library acquired several computers with its\nown funds and some from additional funds from a project. \n\n \n\nEven then, economic statistics from NEDA can be accessed online\nthrough the NEDA Web site at <http://www.neda.gov.ph> . \n\n \n\nAside from this, other attached NEDA agencies like the National\nStatistics Coordination Board have automated library systems, said Ms.\nSalvatierra. \n\n \n\nThe UP Diliman Main Library is also having financial problems\nwhich is partly why its CD-ROM and OPAC services are not yet locally\nnetworked. \n\n \n\n\"  Business World Online  \" learned of\na campus-wide proposal done in 1995 to network the UP Diliman library system\ncomposed of 24 unit libraries. \n\n \n\nFor around &peso;38 million, the 1995 proposal called for the\nautomation of the operations and services of each unit library, their\ninteroperability, and accessibility via the Internet through the DilNet. \n\n \n\n\"  Business World Online  \" has\nattempted gathering data from the UP Diliman libraries and, based on\ninterviews with students, faculty and librarians themselves, this networked\nlibrary system is not yet operational. \n\n \n\nMs. David, head of the committee that drafted the 1995 plan, said\nthe UP administration has asked for an expanded proposal to include the other\nlibrary systems within the UP nationwide system composed of six autonomous\nuniversities from Luzon to Mindanao. \n\n \n\nAn estimated &peso;100 million is needed for the UP system-wide\ncomputerization.\n\n\nBy order of priority, an estimated &peso;10 million is needed in the\nfirst year to set up a hub in the UP Diliman Main Library to house a server\nand the TINLIB software, said Ms. David. \n\n \n\nThe system-wide library proposal is seen to be part of the\nongoing system-wide electronic networking of the State University. \n\n \n\nIn an earlier interview, UP vice-president for information and\ncommunication systems Emmanuel T. Velasco said UP is currently laying the\nphysical infrastructure to intercampus networking of the entire university\nsystem. \n\n \n\nThe wiring up of the UP Diliman Main Library building has been\nidentified as priority for the building 's local area networking ( LAN). \n\n \n\nThe LAN will network its on-line public access catalog ( OPAC)\nwhich will eventually be accessed from a central database server, said Ms.\nCastillo. \n\n\n  ISLANDS  \n\n \n\nCurrently, the Main Library has islands of databases being\nmaintained by the different sections of the library.\n\n\nBut the contents of the databases are still far from being complete\nas Ms. Castillo admitted they still have more records to automate.\n\n\nFor instance, data obtained from the UP Diliman Main Library showed\nthe book database contains 122,352 records out of the more than one million\nvolumes of books in their collection. \n\n \n\nThe financial problem is shared by librarians nationwide, noted\nRod Tarlit, president of the Philippine Librarians Association, Inc. ( PLAI),\nthe association of professional librarians in the country. \n\n \n\nHe told \"  Business World Online  \"\nthat while PLAI members are aware of the need to computerize and even conduct\nseminars about this, the librarians are generally agreeable that their\nlibraries do not have enough funds to computerize operations. \n\n \n\nAside from lack of funding, the lack of expertise on automation\namong librarians and government policies likewise hinder the automation of\nlibraries. \n\n \n\nWhile the UP study revealed that librarians do not have negative\nattitudes about the automation of library operations, other experts in the\nfield of information science are concerned over the lack of training and\nexpertise in implementing automation, and the lack of a government policy to\nsupport the information specialists like librarians. \n\n \n\nIn an S&T forum last year, Science and Technology Information\nInstitute director Jose L. Guerrero noted that while librarians have great\npotentials and are important in the development of S&T in the country, they\nare also  \" underrated professionals &rdquo;  that have\nyet to catch up with the latest developments in computer hardware and\nsoftware. \n\n \n\nTaking off from Mr. Negroponte 's argument, Mr. Guerrero said the\ninformation keepers/custodians like librarians  \" can lead to\nthe gradual transformation ( of society) from the book to the digital era.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nOn the other hand, UP Institute of Library Science dean Josephine\nSison noted that the lack of a clearly stated policy on S&T information (\nSTI), however, is hampering the type of service these custodians can deliver\nto the information users. \n\n \n\nIn the same forum, Ms. Sison suggested the STI policy should be a\ngovernment priority included in the National Information Technology Plan (\nNITP), the former Ramos administration 's blueprint for IT in the country.\n\n\n \n\n \" Drastic measures must be taken to prepare S&T\nlibrarians for the emerging competition from other professions for a bigger\nand bigger slice of the information pie, &rdquo;  said Ms. Sison\nwhile emphasizing that these professions should develop their skills in the\nnew information technologies. \n\n \n\n \" It would also be ideal if DTI services provision\nis guided by a national information policy included in the NITP in the very\nnear future to lend focus and direction in this very important area, &rdquo;\n she added. \n\n \n\nIn the recent interview, Ms. Castillo said even with the updated\nNITP, dubbed as \" IT 21 \" , there is no library component,\nalthough there is an education component. \n\n \n\nBut library administrators are not the only hindrance to the\ncomputerization of libraries. \n\n \n\nAt the UP Diliman Main Library and the National Library, computer\nservices heads told tales of tampering with the computers. \n\n \n\nThe National Library, for instance, already started using a\nWindows-based OPAC for its information navigator.\n\n\nHowever, library staff and Information Technology Center head Mercy\nL. Roberto said they had to remove the Windows-based program because the\nresearchers allegedly got into other software programs in the computers aside\nfrom the on-line public access catalog. \n\n \n\nSimilarly, Ms. Castillo told of cases where the OPAC databases\nwere deleted by the researchers.\n\n\nThis problem caused the UP Diliman Main Library to settle for\nstand-alone PCs such that if one PC 's database is deleted, the other units\ncan be used by the other researchers. \n\n \n\nWith the UP Diliman on-line catalog becoming available in a\nnetwork by end August, Ms. Castillo is now getting concerned about securing\nthe network. \n\n \n\nTo remedy the problem about experts, Ms. David suggested forming\na team composed of a librarian, technical experts in computer system\nadministration or networking and hardware and software, and a database or\nrecords management expert.\n\n\nThis team can work on a plan to establish the automated system. \n\n \n\nWhile bigger libraries have to cope with many problems, smaller\nand specialized libraries are saved from administrative and resource\nproblems. \n\n \n\nOne specialized library that has hurdled the financial problems\nis Ayala Foundation, Inc. 's Filipinas Heritage Library. \n\n \n\nLibrary director Emelina Soriano Almario told \" \nBusiness World Online  \" the two-year-old library housing\n Filipiniana  collection is their implementation of an\nelectronic resource center.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "0ab00f0d-41fc-42a7-81aa-8513bede3aeb", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.269486+00:00"}
{"text": "Online tourist 's guide to cyberspace  \n\n\n Bobby Timonera \n\n \n\nONE day last week, Amy Lecciones asked her staff to do research on\nbiodiversity for her organization 's upcoming seminar for environmental\ngroups in Davao City next week. \n\n \n\nThe seminar is just a few days away, but surprisingly, the\nstaffers of the Philippine Sustainable Development Network, a\nnon-governmental organization, did not look worried at all. \n\n \n\n \" Normally, research work on this takes weeks to\nmonths, &rdquo;  said Amy, who is the PSDN 's program coordinator.\n\n\n \n\nShe explained that to do so, she used to send some of her staff to\nthe best libraries of Metro Manila to look for the latest journals and books\non the topic.\n\n\nOr, they made phone calls or sent fax messages to other organizations\nor academic institutions - - many of them abroad - - which are also\ninterested in the topic. \n\n \n\nToday, the scenario has become very different ever since the PSDN\ngot connected to the Internet over a year ago. \n\n \n\nEnter Vic Reyes, PSDN 's resident computer geek and Internet\nexpert. \n\n \n\nVic typed in the word \" \" biodiversity &rdquo;\n\" in his computer, which was already hooked up to the Internet.\n\n\nA few seconds later, his computer screen showed several possible\nlocations where to get the documents - - mostly from computerized libraries\nof universities and those of environmental groups and agencies. \n\n \n\nVic browsed through the available documents and saved to his\ncomputer 's hard disk the ones his organization needed.\n\n\nFrom one computer site in the United States, he then moved on to\nanother location. \n\n \n\nBefore I could count to five, he was already in another \"\nvirtual library &rdquo; in Australia.\n\n\nAfter getting some documents, he went to another site somewhere in\nEurope, then back to the US again. \n\n \n\nIn short, he was virtually travelling around the world at what\nseemed like the speed of light, finding the documents he needed and bringing\nthem right to his office as fast as Superman could do it. \n\n \n\n \" All in all, it took me less than 10 minutes to\nretrieve these five documents, &rdquo;  Vic said, showing me the\nprinted copies of the materials. \n\n \n\nWeeks or even months of work was done in just 10 minutes, with\njust a few keystrokes or clicks of the computer mouse. \n\n\n  What is the Internet?  \n\n \n\nThe Internet goes by different names.\n\n\nIt is sometimes called simply as \" \" The net, &rdquo;\n\" or \" \" Information Superhighway, &rdquo; \"\n\" \" Cyberspace, &rdquo; \" \"  \"\nInfobahn &rdquo;  \" and many others.\n\n\nBut what really is the Internet? \n\n \n\nThe book \" \" The Internet for Dummies &rdquo;\n\" by John R. Levine and Carol Baroudi defines it as  \"\nthe world 's largest computer network. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nNowadays, computers are quite popular in Philippine offices,\nschools and in some homes.\n\n\nWhen these computers are connected to each other so they could\nexchange information - - through cables, telephone wires, satellite links or\nthrough whatever medium - - they form what is called a \" \"\nnetwork. &rdquo; \" \n\n \n\nTake the case of automated teller machines.\n\n\nBecause ATMs are actually computers that communicate with other\nmachines - - even those in far away places - - a depositor can withdraw money\nin Zamboanga while on a business trip although his bank account is in Manila.\n\n\n \n\nNow, think of thousands of computer networks - - large and small,\nfrom all over the world - - combined all together, exchanging data with each\nother.\n\n\nThat is the Internet.\n\n\nThat 's why others call it \"  \" the network of\nall networks &rdquo;  \" or \"  \" the\nmother of all networks. &rdquo;  \" \n\n \n\nTo date, there are about 40,000 of these networks with about 40\nmillion users the world over. \n\n\n  What 's in it for you?  \n\n \n\nThe Internet may sound so technical, as if only computer geeks\nlike Vic of PSDN can make it work for them. \n\n \n\n \" But virtually everybody can benefit from it, both\nthe techie types and the non-technical ones, &rdquo;  stressed Kelsey\nHartigan-Go of De La Salle University 's computer services center. \n\n \n\nNavigating the Internet now has become so easy and user-friendly\nthat people who use it say they are  \" surfing the Internet,\"\n referring to how leisurely it is to cruise along the Information\nSuperhighways. \n\n \n\nNo wonder even children, nuns and many other mortals get so\naddicted to it. \n\n \n\nLet 's take a look at what the Net has to offer. \n\n \n\nIts primary function is communication - - mainly through\nelectronic mail, or e-mail for short. \n\n \n\nWith e-mail, your letters can reach their destinations almost\ninstantly, perhaps within a few seconds to a few minutes - - even to\nlocations on the opposite site of the globe.\n\n\nIn contrast, how long can your \" snail-mail &rdquo; ( sent via\npost office or a private forwarding company) reach its destination? \n\n \n\n \" If you still do not have an e-mail address two\nyears from now, you 'll be classified as a dinosaur, &rdquo;  said\nJim Ayson, one of the acknowledged local Internet experts. \n\n \n\nOf course, the Internet cannot totally eliminate the traditional\nmailing system, telephone calls and fax transmissions - - but it can transmit\nmessages at significantly reduced costs and with far better efficiency. \n\n \n\nYou can actually \" talk &rdquo; using the Internet,\nconversing in real time with another person who is on the opposite side of\nthe globe. \n\n \n\nChatting in Cyberspace, though, is still mainly done by typing\nwords on the keyboard instead of saying them aloud.\n\n\nBut with the recent introduction of the Internet phone and similar\ncomputer programs, you can do away with long distance telephone bills soon.\n\n\nInternet videophone is also around the corner. \n\n \n\nFor researchers like Amy and Vic, the Internet is heaven on\nearth. \n\n \n\nThousands and thousands of offices and agencies - - including the\nlibraries of Harvard University - - have made millions of documents available\non the Internet, free for everyone to read or retrieve. \n\n \n\nTo make life simpler, some guys on the Internet have devised\nsearch tools, like the Lycos program Vic used.\n\n\nJust by using keywords, one is led to potential locations where to\nfind documents on a certain topic. \n\n \n\nThink of about any topic you want to search on - - from kitchen\nmenus to video clips of a rocket launch - - and you can definitely find it on\nthe Internet.\n\n\nIt 's just a matter of mastering your way around. \n\n \n\nWith the advent of the World Wide Web, which is a systematic way\nof linking one database to another, searching for information has become even\neasier and much more fun. \n\n \n\nAside from documents, millions of computer programs can also be\n\" downloaded &rdquo; ( copied from computers in faraway places right to\nyour own PC) for free.\n\n\nThey are either \" \" freeware &rdquo; \" (\nabsolutely free) or \" \" shareware, &rdquo; \" which is\nfree for you to evaluate for a certain period, but which you must register\nand pay for once you have decided to use it for a long period. \n\n \n\nThe Internet is not all work.\n\n\nThere are also lots of fun out there - - games, gossip and yes, even\n\" cyber sex. &rdquo;  \n\n\n\n\n  On-line tourist visits RP  \n\n\n Bobby Timonera \n\n\n  ( Second of four parts)  \n\n \n\nTHE Internet started in 1969 as a United States military project\nduring the Cold War, then called \" ARPAnet \" , being managed\nby the Advanced Research Projects Administration. \n\n \n\nIt was mainly an experiment on how to put up a reliable computer\nnetwork over long distances - - using high-speed telephone lines - - so it\ncan resist enemy attack.\n\n\nIt also served as a link between the military and their contractors,\nincluding some universities doing military-related research. \n\n \n\nThe ARPAnet was so successful that soon, most universities wanted\nto be part of it.\n\n\nOver the years, more and more civilian use were integrated into the\nnetwork.\n\n\nQuickly, its reach spanned the globe, and was later called the\n\" Internet \" . \n\n \n\nThe ARPAnet technology proved to be so reliable, largely due to\n\" dynamic rerouting, &rdquo; a system wherein if one of the network\nlinks were disrupted - - say by an enemy attack - - data transmitted through\nit were automatically rerouted through other links. \n\n \n\nTo illustrate how reliable it is, here 's an excerpt from the\nbest-selling book \" \" The Internet for Dummies &rdquo;\n\" : \n\n \n\n \" Can the Internet really resist enemy attack?\n\n\nIt looks that way.\n\n\nDuring the Gulf War in 1991, the US military had considerable\ntrouble knocking out the Iraqi command network.\n\n\nIt turned out that the Iraqis were using commercially available\nnetwork routers with standard Internet routing and recovery technology.\n\n\nIn other words, dynamic rerouting worked.\n\n\nIt 's nice to know that dynamic rerouting works, although perhaps\nthis was not the most opportune way to find out. &rdquo;   \n\n\n  Internet in the Philippines  \n\n \n\nIn the Philippines, the first concerted effort to connect to the\nInternet started in mid-1993 when the Department of Science and Technology\ninitiated the formation of the Philippine Network Foundation Inc. ( PFI) to\nstudy the possibility of establishing a national network with access to the\nInternet.\n\n\nIt was to be called \" PHnet \" . \n\n \n\nA month later, in July, the DOST facilitated a dial-up access (\nthat is, calling overseas via long distance) for the leading academic\ninstitutions via the Victoria University of Technology of Australia. \n\n \n\nThen, in March 1994, the DOST got a dedicated leased line direct\nto the US, thus negating the need to dial long distance to connect. \n\n \n\nInitially, 10 institutions had direct access to the Internet via\nleased line connection.\n\n\nAside from the DOST, these are the Ateneo de Manila University, De La\nSalle University, University of the Philippines in Diliman, UP Los\nBa&ntilde;os, University of Sto. Tomas, the Industrial Research Foundation,\nSt. Louis University in Baguio, University of San Carlos in Cebu and Xavier\nUniversity in Cagayan de Oro City. \n\n \n\nConnected later to the PHnet were Mosaic Communications\nPhilippines ( a commercial Internet service provider), DOST 's Advanced\nScience and Technology Institute at UP Diliman, Mindanao State\nUniversity-Iligan Institute of Technology, the Asian Institute of Management\nand, a few weeks ago, UP Manila. \n\n \n\nThis year, in Metro Manila alone, at least eight more commercial\nInternet access providers bloomed, each getting their Internet connections\nindependent from PHnet, some with much faster capability. \n\n \n\nGeographically, Juan de la Cruz can now access the Internet\nwithout need to call long distance in Metro Manila, Baguio, Los Ba&ntilde;os,\nCebu, Cagayan de Oro and Iligan.\n\n\nBut anybody from any part of the country with a direct distance\ndialing telephone system can actually connect to the Internet, although at\nmuch added expense. \n\n \n\nExpansion is now under way. \n\n \n\n \" We intend to bring the Internet to the key cities\nof all regions of the country, &rdquo;  said Risa Carlos of PFI.\n\n\nThis may be realized with the third phase of PFI 's project to wire\nthe Philippines, she added, when its new leased line becomes operational by\nthe end of October.\n\n\nPFI 's new line will have four times the capacity of its existing\nline.\n\n\nThe long list of applicants for leased lines will then be granted\naccess. \n\n \n\nA commercial ISP which currently has the largest capacity,\nSequel.Net, will also make the Internet accessible in Davao by October, and\nin Subic Bay in Olongapo and Clark in Angeles before the end of the year,\naccording to company spokesman Bobby Roldan. \n\n \n\nAnd trials on accessing the Internet through VHF and UHF radio is\nnow under way. \n\n \n\nCompared to many countries, the Philippines ventured into\nCyberspace quite late.\n\n\nBut Internet experts Jim Ayson and Kelsey Hartigan-Go noted the\n\" very fast &rdquo; growth of Netsurfers. \n\n \n\n \" Judging by developments in the past few months,\nwe 're definitely catching up with our neighboring countries, &rdquo;\n said PFI 's Carlos. \n\n \n\nAyson pointed out that we may, by now, even be at par with leader\nHong Kong when it comes to the number of ISPs.\n\n\nAyson was quick to note, however, that the Philippines is still in\nits  \" infancy stage &rdquo;  when it comes to tapping\nthe Internet as an information tool. \n\n \n\n \" There is still a lot of work to do in educating\nthe public, &rdquo;  Ayson said. \n\n \n\n\" When you look at the global Cyberspace, the Philippines\nis the equivalent of a back hole in the universe, &rdquo;  said Vic\nReyes of the Philippine Sustainable Development Network.\n\n\n \" We get so much information from it, but nothing goes\nout from us. &rdquo;  \n\n\n  More participation  \n\n \n\nReyes implies that to be part of the global information village,\nthe Philippines should make its information available to the world.\n\n\nSo far, there are some Filipino-oriented \" home pages &rdquo;\nin the World Wide Web - - which serves as a sort of \" show room &rdquo;\nfor companies, organizations or individuals in the Internet - - but most of\nthese are maintained by Filipinos abroad. \n\n \n\nIn fact, one of those home pages called \" \" Cyber\n bayan  , &rdquo; \" supposed to be the Filipinos '\nhome in Cyberspace, is maintained by an American. \n\n \n\n \" Seems like we still have a lot to do to convince\ngovernment agencies to make their information online, &rdquo;  he\nadded. \n\n \n\nBut even before going to that stage, there is still one major\nproblem that hounds potential Internet users in the Philippines - - the lack\nof telephone lines.\n\n\nData gathered by the Center for Telecommunications Studies show that\nphone density in the Philippines is at a low 1.667 per 100 households.\n\n\nIt even goes to as low as .207 in the Bicol Region. \n\n \n\n \" The growth of the Internet depends on the\ntelecommunications industry, &rdquo;  Hartigan-Go said. \n\n \n\nAlso, the rates being offered by local Internet service\nproviders as of now are still expensive, at least compared to those in the\nUnited States, noted Ayson.\n\n\nAverage fee for a 12-hour access in a month ( so short for a serious\nuser) is about &peso;800, and about &peso;75 per extra hour used.\n\n\nSome ISPs offer it at just &peso;600 a month for 30 hours, but you\nhave to pay one year in advance to enjoy this discounted rate.\n\n\nCompare that to the &dollar;20 ( about &peso;500) with unlimited\naccess time offered by some US companies. \n\n \n\nNext week, we 'll discuss the equipment and the steps you need\nto take to finally hook up to the Internet.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "45df308c-fc33-4f58-9a02-30ffd2189b3e", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.270775+00:00"}

Eliseo Mercado, chair of the Quick Reaction Team ( QRT)\nformed by the government and the MILF, said both sides would also discuss the\nresults of a two-day workshop at the  Notre Dame \nUniversity Peace Center, which was attended by Army and MILF field\ncommanders, and town mayors. \n\n \n\nGovernment panel chair Orlando Soriano and his MILF counterpart,\nAleem Mimbantas, will attend today 's meeting. \n\n \n\n \" The scheduled meeting of President Estrada and (\nMILF) chair Hashim Salamat is giving us bright hopes for the success of the\nnegotiations, &rdquo;  Jaafar told the \" INQUIRER \" .\n\n\n \n\nJaafar said the  \" ceasefire forever\"  and\n \" peace forever &rdquo;  statements of Salamat and\nPresidential Adviser on Flagship Projects in Mindanao Robert Aventajado on\nThursday  \" restored our confidence in the government. &rdquo;\n\n\n\n  No to MILF demands  \n\n \n\nMr. Estrada had said he would not give in to the rebels ' demands\nbut agreed to meet Salamat late this month to discuss economic prospects in\nmineral-rich Mindanao. \n\n \n\n \" If I get to talk to Chairman Salamat, I would ask\nhim to set aside the conflict and help the government develop before talking\nabout their demands, &rdquo;  Mr. Estrada said in his weekly radio\nprogram  \" Jeep ni Erap &rdquo;  on Saturday. \n\n \n\nField reports received by the military 's Southern Command (\nSouthcom) in Zamboanga City indicated large guerrilla movements in nearby\nBukidnon, where they have allegedly occupied several areas and set up\ntemporary camps. \n\n \n\nThe guerrillas, armed with small rockets and mortars, were\nbelieved to be strengthening their positions, having constructed bunkers and\nfoxholes in several hinterland villages in Bukidnon, Army spokesman Col.\nHoracio Lapinid said. \n\n \n\n \" The MILF forces are not supposed to be there,\n&rdquo;  Lapinid said, stressing that this violated the truce that\ncalled for both camps to maintain positions and refrain from firing. \n\n \n\nMILF guerrillas were only an \" eyeball &rdquo; away from\nArmy frontlines in one village, he said. \n\n\n  No troop movement  \n\n \n\nJaafar denied any troop movement, saying the MILF was \n\" strictly observing the truce signed with the government. &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\n \" We do not have any reports from our field\ncommanders about ( Lapinid 's) allegation, &rdquo;  he said. \n\n \n\nJaafar, quoting chief government negotiator Soriano, earlier\ndisclosed Malaysia and Libya had offered to host the peace negotiations\nbetween Manila and the rebels. \n\n \n\nHe said  \" secret negotiations\"  between\nManila and Kuala Lumpur were ongoing but the MILF was also looking at South\nAfrica, Indonesia, Turkey and Saudi Arabia as other possible venues. \n\n \n\nThe MILF, the country 's largest remaining  Moro \ninsurgent group, has been fighting for the separate Islamic state since 1978,\nwhen it split with the larger  Moro  National Liberation Front\n( MNLF). \n\n \n\nThe MNLF signed a peace accord with Manila in 1996 and was\ngranted limited autonomy in several provinces in Mindanao. \n\n \n\nMILF legal counsel Ferdausi Abbas, however, said his group\nremained  \" wary of entering into an agreement &rdquo; \nwith Manila, citing several provisions in the MNLF-Manila deal that have not\nbeen implemented three years after the accord. \n\n\n  Cause, solutions unclear  \n\n \n\nAlthough fighting between Muslim separatists and government\ntroops may have ceased in Maguindanao, the cause of the clashes remains as\nunclear as the possible solutions to the festering conflict. \n\n \n\nPreliminary peace talks between the government and the MILF have\nbeen going on for more than a year, but last month 's fighting in Maguindanao\nhas indicated the distrust between the two sides. \n\n \n\nAnti-government groups have charged that the military\norchestrated the clashes to either force an increase in the military budget\nor to help some officers get promotion. \n\n \n\nMilitary officers and Christian civilians blamed the MILF, saying\nthe separatists ' main concern was protecting their criminal activities, such\nas extorting money from drivers on a major highway and giving refuge to\nkidnap gangs targeting Christians and ethnic Chinese. \n\n \n\nThe guerrillas denounced abuses by armed gangs of Christians and\nthe military in the 1970s, including the slaughter of 1,000 Muslims hiding in\na mosque and the rape of Muslim women. \n\n \n\n \" It 's become normal to us, this armed conflict,\n&rdquo;  another fighter said.  \n\n\n\n\n  Napocor: Bidding not rigged  \n\n\n Clarissa S.

\nSarmiento told the \" INQUIRER \" . \n\n \n\nThe forfeiture case would be the  \" turning point,\n&rdquo;  Sarmiento said, in proving that the Marcoses  \"\nplundered\"  the economy during the strongman rule. \n\n \n\nThe PCGG tracked down the loot in two Swiss banks in the name of\nsix Marcos foundations and under the pseudonym of \" Jane Ryan &rdquo;\nfor Imelda Marcos and \" William Saunders &rdquo; for Ferdinand Marcos.\n\n\n \n\nThe Marcos accounts involving some &dollar;356 million in 1995\nhave since grown to &dollar;590 million as of Dec. 31, 1998 due to the\naccrued interests. \n\n \n\nThe forfeiture case was filed seven years ago before the \nSandiganbayan  . \n\n\n  200 cases  \n\n \n\nAccording to Sarmiento, the PCGG has 200 other ill-gotten wealth\ncases filed against the Marcoses and the cronies since 1986 after the Edsa\nRevolt. \n\n \n\nAll of these cases are pending in various courts and have yet to\nreach the pre-trial stage after more than 12 years of litigation, he said.\n\n\n \n\nSarmiento attributed the delay to the lack of legal manpower.\n\n\nSarmiento said that the previous PCGG commissioners retained the\nservices of lawyers only on a part-time basis, including those recruited from\nthe Office of the Solicitor General. \n\n \n\nThis time, he said, the new lawyers will be concentrating on\nnothing but the recovery of the Marcos assets with the collaboration of state\nprosecutors. \n\n \n\nSarmiento refused to divulge the lawyers ' identities to spare\nthem from possible pressures from interested parties. \n\n \n\n \" With the help of the experienced lawyers that we 've\nhired, we are optimistic that we can concentrate on fighting it out in\nvarious courts, &rdquo;  Sarmiento said.\n\n\n \" Hopefully, we can now concentrate on handling the\npre-trial of the cases and win big for the government. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nSarmiento explained there was  \" overwhelming\nevidence &rdquo;  for the government to win the cases. \n\n \n\n \" The PCGG has been conducting a thorough review of\nthe cases filed against the Marcoses and their cronies, and the indications\nare that the government will succeed in obtaining for itself favorable\ndecisions eventually, &rdquo;  the PCGG statement noted. \n\n\n  Escrow amount  \n\n \n\nThe money involved in the forfeiture case was remitted to the PNB\non April 16, 1998 pursuant to the escrow agreements signed between the PCGG\nand the Philippine National Bank. \n\n \n\nThe validity of the escrow agreement has been upheld by the Swiss\nFederal Supreme Court. \n\n \n\nThe PNB, in compliance with the Swiss high court 's decision,\ninvested the Marcos deposits in  \" high-yield securities, bonds,\nnotes and precious metals &rdquo;  in various investment houses with\n\" AA &rdquo; rating in England, Hong Kong, Switzerland, Singapore and\nthe United States, Sarmiento had earlier told the \" INQUIRER\n\" . \n\n \n\nThe money, however, remained at the disposal of the Swiss\nauthorities. \n\n \n\nSarmiento said the  \" bottom line\"  in the\nscheduled vigorous prosecution of the cases was to  \" obtain\njudgment\"  against the Marcoses to recover the &dollar;590 million in\nMarcos deposits held in escrow at the Philippine National Bank. \n\n \n\nWhile the escrow money was earning huge interest after it had\nbeen invested in five foreign countries, Sarmiento said, the government could\nnot tap the money pending court judgment against the Marcoses. \n\n\n  Why agreement stalled  \n\n \n\nThe agreement between the government and the Marcoses has been\nstalled because the Supreme Court disallowed a settlement with the Marcoses\nif it involved the dropping of criminal charges against the Marcoses and the\ngranting of immunity from suit and tax exemptions. \n\n \n\nThe compromise would also violate the condition set by the Swiss\nFederal Court that before the money could be touched, the Philippine\ngovernment must compensate the more than 10,000 human rights victims during\nthe Marcos dictatorship. \n\n \n\nDuring negotiations with the Marcoses, it also became clear to\nPresident Estrada that the Marcos heirs were not speaking with one voice.\n\n\n \n\nWhile the Marcos children want an immediate settlement, Imelda\nMarcos is intent on pursuing cases against her husband 's cronies, who had\nallegedly been entrusted, according to her, with &peso;500-billion worth of\nthe Marcos assets. \n\n \n\nThe PCGG 's renewed commitment harks back to its original\nmandate, which was to sequester and recover the Marcos loot and to file the\nnecessary criminal and civil cases against the dictator and his family and\nassociates. \n\n \n\nOver the weekend, Makati Rep. Joker Arroyo, who was the executive\nsecretary when the PCGG was formed in 1986, proposed a formula on how to\nrecover the Marcos ill-gotten wealth:  \" To prosecute the\nMarcoses till kingdom come. &rdquo;   \n\n\n\n\n  Rigged biddings ' supplier exposes Napocor  \n\n\nJerry Esplana\n\n \n\nA SYNDICATE has been manipulating biddings for multimillion-peso\ncontracts at the National Power Corp. to favor multinational corporations\nover Filipino firms, according to a Makati-based supplier of the state-run\nfirm. \n\n \n\nAside from the usual bribes, members of the syndicate got \n\" free trips abroad with matching pocket money, sponsorships of wedding\nbanquets and Duty Free shopping sprees, &rdquo;  among other perks\nfrom some of those firms, it said. \n\n \n\nThe disclosures were made by Renato Santos, president of R. V.\nSantos Construction and Development Corp., a Makati City-based company and\none of the local suppliers of Napocor. \n\n \n\nA high Napocor official confirmed the rigging of the bidding\nprocess. \n\n \n\nThe official, who asked not to be named, said  \"\npeople assigned to evaluate the bids can disqualify you anytime and you\ncannot complain and recommend the awarding of the contract to another\ncompany. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" In most cases, &rdquo;  the official\nsaid,  \" they rig the bidding process during the evaluation\nstage. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThe official added:  \" It is sad because they always\nhave the final say.\n\n\nThat is why, if you are a supplier you have to be nice to them.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nAnother whistle-blower, also a local supplier of Napocor, said he\nwould also  \" come out in the open and spill the beans &rdquo;\n after he shall have consulted his lawyer. \n\n \n\n  \" Tama na, sobra na  ( Enough\nalready), Filipino companies are deliberately being eased out ( by the\nNapocor syndicate), &rdquo;  said the businessman, who asked not to\nbe identified. \n\n \n\nThe \" INQUIRER \" source said  \"\nbiddings at Napocor were being conducted just to comply with the law, &rdquo;\n a claim confirmed by Napocor insiders, including officers and\nmembers of the Napocor Employees Consolidated Union. \n\n \n\nIn an unprecedented move, Santos expressed willingness to\ncooperate with Malaca&ntilde;ang and the House of Representatives in their\ninvestigation of reported bidding irregularities at the power firm. \n\n \n\nAt the same time, Santos appealed to President Estrada to \n\" do something about the bidding irregularities at Napocor. &rdquo;\n \n\n\n  Erap 's order revoked  \n\n \n\nIn September, President Estrada formed an oversight committee to\nensure a graft-free bidding in the power company. \n\n \n\nMr. Estrada had earlier said he was seriously concerned about the\nillegal activities of the Napocor syndicate. \n\n \n\nBut he was  \" prevailed upon by proteges of ( former\nEnergy Minister) Geronimo Velasco to revoke the President 's memorandum (\nlate last year), &rdquo;  a top Palace official said. \n\n \n\nThe Malaca&ntilde;ang source was referring to Energy Secretary\nMario Tiaoqui, who is also Napocor chair, and Napocor president Federico\nPuno. \n\n \n\nSantos told the \" INQUIRER \" that his company\nhad won several biddings for power projects but  \" lost some of\nthem to foreign companies favored by Napocor. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nSantos cited, among others, Project 1159 for which \n\" ( R. V. Santos Construction and Development Corp.) was the lowest\nbidder at &dollar;28.7 million. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Some people in the bidding committee questioned\nsome minor technicalities in our bid.\n\n\nEventually, they awarded the contract to a foreign company with a bid\nof &dollar;35 million, &rdquo;  he said. \n\n \n\nThe other bidders for Project 1159 included Hyundai (\n&dollar;31.8 million), Hanil ( &dollar;31.9 million), Siemens ( &dollar;40.8\nmillion), Asea Brown Boveri ( &dollar;42.4 million), Xiamen ( &dollar;44.1\nmillion), GEC Malayan ( &dollar;46.1 million) and Holec ( &dollar;73.7\nmillion). \n\n \n\nIn the bidding for Project 1121, Santos ' company was again the\nlowest bidder in all three stages of the bidding. \n\n\n  Pressure from above  \n\n \n\nSantos said he got one of the biggest surprises of his life when\nthe Napocor bidding committee announced that it would give him only one\ncontract and award the other two to Xiamen and ABB. \n\n \n\n \" And guess what they told me?\n\n\nThey said they had to distribute the other contracts to other\ncompanies so everybody would be happy.\n\n\nThe engineering design manager, a certain Mr. Matulac, said they had\nto do it because of pressure from above.\n\n\nOf course, he didn't say who, &rdquo;  Santos said. \n\n \n\nIn Napocor Project 008, ABB got the contract with a bid of\n&dollar;2.42 million although R. V. Santos offered the lowest bid of\n&dollar;1.9 million. \n\n \n\nA similar situation occurred in the bidding for Project 0100.\n\n\nABB bagged the contract with a bid of &dollar;286,000 although R. V.\nSantos again submitted the lowest bid at &dollar;262,000.  \n\n\n\n\n   'Overwhelming'  evidence cited vs.\nMarcoses  \n\n\nDonna S. Cueto and Lynda T. Jumilla\n\n \n\nTHE GOVERNMENT has such  \" overwhelming\" \nevidence against the Marcoses that it now expects to obtain a judgment of\nforfeiture against them within the year, Solicitor General Ricardo Galvez\nyesterday said. \n\n \n\nStarting this month, government lawyers will present the evidence\nagainst the Marcoses on the main forfeiture case filed with the \nSandiganbayan  , according to Galvez. \n\n \n\nPresident Estrada said Tuesday the Marcoses could either forge a\nsettlement with the government or face forfeiture of their ill-gotten wealth.\n\n\n \n\nGalvez said the anti-graft court had finally allowed the\ngovernment to present its evidence on Civil Case No. 0141 after a four-month\nlull.\n\n\nThe last hearing was held in November. \n\n \n\n \" We want to continue with the hearings.\n\n\nWe can finish this within the year if the  Sandiganbayan\n will allow us, &rdquo;  he said in an interview. \n\n \n\nBut Galvez said the government could still settle amicably with\nthe Marcoses on the civil suit.\n\n\nThe case is open for settlement at any stage of the proceedings even\nup to the point when the case is submitted for decision, according to the\ngovernment 's chief lawyer. \n\n \n\nThe Presidential Commission on Good Government has hired five\ntop-notch lawyers to pursue with new vigor the forfeiture case.\n\n\nThis is part of the two-track approach of the Estrada administration\nin recovering the ill-gotten wealth of the Marcoses. \n\n \n\nThe other is holding negotiations with the family for a possible\ncompromise agreement. \n\n\n  List of evidence  \n\n \n\nGalvez said he had submitted the government 's list of evidence\nto the  Sandiganbayan  , including the income tax returns of\nthe late President Ferdinand Marcos, his wife Imelda and their children as\nwell as their admissions on the property that they own. \n\n \n\nWhat government lawyers could do is just to compare the\ndiscrepancies of the Marcoses ' income with their unexplained wealth,\nincluding the &dollar;590 million held in escrow by the Philippine National\nBank. \n\n \n\nThe forfeiture case was filed in 1991 but it has been delayed by\nthe motions filed by the Marcoses, including their request to implement the\ncontroversial 1993 compromise agreement which called for a 75-25 sharing in\nfavor of the government. \n\n \n\nA motion to dismiss the forfeiture case was filed by the Marcoses\nlate last year. \n\n\n  Public disclosure  \n\n \n\nIn the Senate, Malaca&ntilde;ang was asked yesterday to make\npublic the details of negotiations for a compromise on the ill-gotten wealth\nof the Marcoses amid suspicions that the deal would favor the heirs of the\nlate strongman. \n\n \n\nSenate Minority Leader Teofisto Guingona Jr. made the call in a\nprivilege speech in which he cautioned the government against entering into a\ncompromise  \" unless legal and moral. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nHe also asked the Senate to look into the talks between the\nPalace and the Marcos heirs to determine if the proposed deal would \n\" bring justice to the nation. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" There exists basic roadblocks to compromise,\nroadblocks that are legal and moral, &rdquo;  said Guingona, former\nchair of the Commission on Audit. \n\n \n\nHe focused on two legal obstacles and left it to the government\nand the people to determine the moral ones. \n\n \n\nOne legal obstacle to forging a deal with the Marcoses is the\nfamily 's demand for immunity from prosecution in exchange for giving up a\nportion of \" their &rdquo; assets. \n\n \n\n \" The grant of immunity would seemingly not apply\nto the Marcoses because they are the legal respondents in cases whose basic\npurpose pursuant to law is to recover assets illegally acquired, &rdquo;\n Guingona said. \n\n \n\n \" At most, settlement may only extinguish civil\nliability, &rdquo;  he said. \n\n\n  Roadblock  \n\n \n\nA second roadblock is the Marcoses ' demand for tax exemptions,\nwhich according to Guingona, will be tantamount to giving the Marcoses\n \" undue favor. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" While Congress has the power to grant tax\nexemption, especially so when it is to the public benefit or interest, the\nexercise of such power to exempt is subject to the same general and specific\nlimitations imposed on the power to tax, &rdquo;  Guingona said. \n\n \n\nEarlier, Sen. Raul Roco urged the government to call off the\nnegotiation with the Marcoses, saying nothing was coming out of it. \n\n \n\nRoco, co-chair of the Senate inquiry into Ms. Marcos ' claims of\nownership in several firms estimated at &peso;500 billion, said the\ngovernment should instead pursue the ill-gotten wealth and other cases\nagainst the Marcos heirs. \n\n \n\nHe said the two sides were nowhere near a settlement on the\nrecovery of the ill-gotten wealth.\n\n\nWorse, he said, the Marcos family seemed to be the one dictating the\nterms of the settlement. \n\n \n\nRoco said aborting talks for a compromise settlement would take\nsome of the pressure off the government, especially on the matter of pursuing\nthe ill-gotten wealth cases.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "0e51f3fd-c0be-4244-b633-c5b3f0db5dca", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.273050+00:00"}
{"text": "Jimenez  hit for conflict of interest  \n\n\n Jess Diaz \n\n \n\nCongressmen tightened the noose yesterday on beleaguered Quezon\nRep.  Jesus Jimenez  by asking the chamber 's ethics committee to look\ninto his possible violation of the rule against conflict of interest. \n\n \n\nThey made the appeal after learning about the case of Metrobank,\nwhich  Jimenez  , who chairs the powerful House ways and means\ncommittee, wanted investigated for alleged non-payment of &peso;3 billion in\ndocumentary tax. \n\n \n\nThey also learned about the Quezon congressman 's airport deals,\nand his initiatives to have airport authorities investigated for alleged\nirregularities. \n\n \n\n \" The ethics committee should look into  Jimenez\n 's initiative to inquire into Metrobank which, to me, is a clear case of\nconflict of interest, &rdquo;  a member of the ways and means\ncommittee told reporters yesterday. \n\n \n\n Jimenez  , who belongs to President Estrada 's \nLaban ng Masang Pilipino  ( LAMP), had filed Resolution 519 asking\nhis own committee to inquire into the bank 's supposed tax liability. \n\n \n\nTwo vice chairmen of the  Jimenez  panel revealed last\nWednesday that their chairman had told them that he sought the inquiry on\nMetrobank because he wanted to exact vengeance on bank chairman George Ty.\n\n\n \n\nThe two said  Jimenez  had told them that Ty 's bank\nforeclosed in 1984 on his Forbes Park house and lot, which he had mortgaged,\nbecause he defaulted on his payments. \n\n \n\nInterviewed over radio station  DZMM  yesterday, the\nQuezon solon confirmed that he had indeed mortgaged his house and lot with\nMetrobank with a &peso;2.5-million loan and that the bank had seized his\nproperty.\n\n\nHe denied that he was singling out Ty 's bank, though, saying the\nnon-payment by banks of documentary stamps tax for certain transactions was\nan industry-wide problem. \n\n \n\nHis resolution 519, however, singles out Metrobank, one of the\nlargest banks in the country. \n\n \n\nHe told  DZMM  that the inquiry has to begin with the\nlargest banks, but that other banks will have to be investigated as well.\n\n\n \n\nHe did not comment on his two vice chairmen 's claims that he\nwanted to take revenge on Ty. \n\n \n\nThe Tys now reportedly occupy his Forbes Park house which sits on\na huge lot.\n\n\n Jimenez  himself resides in the exclusive Makati village, on\n 666 Hyacinth Ave.  , North Forbes. \n\n \n\nMembers of the ways and means committee have decided to stop\ntheir inquiry on Metrobank and on  La Suerte  Cigar and\nCigarette Co., which was the object of another  Jimenez  investigation\ninitiative, because they felt their investigation was based on flimsy\ngrounds. \n\n \n\nThey said they did not want to be accused of harassment or\nshakedown. \n\n \n\nInternal Revenue Commissioner Beethoven Rualo had told them that\nhis agency had no conclusive findings on the supposed tax liabilities of\nMetrobank and  La Suerte  . \n\n \n\nOn his alleged airports deals,  Jimenez  's colleagues\nlearned that Inter-Asia, a company reportedly owned by the solon and his\nfamily, holds the contract for the three parking lots at the Ninoy Aquino\nInternational Airport ( NAIA). \n\n \n\nAirport sources said Inter-Asia makes at least &peso;50,000 a day\nin clear profit from the parking lots. \n\n \n\nBesides the parking lots,  Jimenez  operates the \n Lahing Filipino   restaurant at NAIA. \n\n \n\nDespite his airport business, the Quezon solon continues to seek\nHouse inquiries into alleged irregularities at the premier airport. \n\n \n\nLast July 27, he filed Resolution 74 asking the appropriate\ncommittee to look into the performance of the winning bidder in the\nconstruction of NAIA Terminal II. \n\n \n\nTwo weeks later, on Aug. 13, he introduced another resolution,\nnumber 181, proposing another inquiry into the conduct of the bidding and the\nawarding of a contract to a single corporation to exclusively run the\nconcession areas at NAIA Terminal II. \n\n \n\nSources said Inter-Asia could be eyeing some concession areas at\nthe second terminal. \n\n \n\nDuring the last Congress, the airport was also the object of\ninvestigation proposals contained in several resolutions introduced by \nJimenez  . \n\n \n\nOther resolutions filed by  Jimenez  had to do with the\nawarding by government agencies of contracts for the procurement of\nnavigational aids or radar systems. \n\n \n\nIt is common knowledge that  Jimenez  owns or represents\ncompanies which supply navigational equipment. \n\n \n\nOther resolutions filed by  Jimenez  during the last\nCongress:\n\n\n* Resolution 80 asking the committee on transportation and\ncommunications to investigate the GEC-Marconi radar project of the Department\nof Transportation and Communications.\n\n\n* Resolution 92 requesting the committee on transportation and\ncommunications to inquire into the short-listing of prospective bidders for\nnew domestic airport terminal at the NAIA complex.\n\n\n* Resolution 232 directing the committee on energy to recommend that\nthe National Power Corp. adopt the lowest bid price of &dollar;1.4 billion\nsubmitted by Consolidated Electric Power Asia as the approved agency estimate\nif a rebidding of the 1,200-megawatt natural gas power plant in Batangas is\nconducted.\n\n\n* Resolution 452 asking the appropriate committee to look into the\npropriety and legality of Napocor 's decision to install a fiber-optic\ntelecommunications system using its present power transmission facilities.\n\n\n* Resolution 453 seeking an inquiry into the award by the Manila\nInternational Airport Authority of a &peso;492.66-million contract to\nSerco-ial, a British company, for the installation of an integrated security\nsystem at NAIA.\n\n\nResolution 446 directing the proper committee to investigate the\nhiring by Napocor of Merill-Lynch as its consultant on its privatization\nprojects.\n\n\n* Resolution 538 seeking an inquiry into the awarding of rights to\nconstruct NAIA III to Asia 's Emerging Dragon Corp. \n\n \n\nAt one hearing during the last Congress,  Jimenez  had a\nheated verbal exchange with then Chairman Richard Gordon of the Subic Bay\nMetropolitan Authority, who was summoned to a House hearing on the purchase\nby SBMA of navigational aids. \n\n \n\nGordon questioned the propriety of  Jimenez  's\nparticipation in the hearing, revealing that the solon had offered to supply\nSBMA with the navigational equipment it needed. \n\n \n\n Jimenez  told  DZMM  yesterday that he\nquestioned Gordon 's purchase because SBMA ignored a bid submitted by an\nAmerican firm, which offered a price lower by &dollar;5 million than the\noffer of Alcatel, the winning bidder. \n\n \n\nHe said the navigational aid supplied by Alcatel is defective\nuntil now. \n\n \n\nSBMA Chairman Felicito Payumo, reached by \" The STAR\n\" , confirmed that the Alcatel equipment is not operational. \n\n \n\n Jimenez  's colleagues in the ways and means committee\nsaid these are but a few conflict of interest cases committed by their\nchairman. \n\n \n\nHouse leaders said it would be difficult for the ethics committee\nprobe on  Jimenez  to prosper if it focuses only on the reports that\nthe Quezon solon has used President Estrada 's name and demanded advance\nkickbacks from potential weapons and radar systems suppliers. \n\n \n\nAssistant Majority Leader Neptali Gonzales II said the committee\nhas to comply with the requirements of due process. \n\n \n\n \" This means that it will have to gather evidence\nand hear witnesses.\n\n\nI don't think anyone, including my complaining colleagues, will come\nout to testify against Congressman  Jimenez  , &rdquo;  he\nsaid. \n\n \n\nAnother House leader said it would perhaps be easier to\ninvestigate and eventually punish  Jimenez  , if the evidence\nwarrants, on the issue of conflict of interest.  \n\n\n\n\n  US-China clash over Spratlys seen  \n\n\n Jess Diaz \n\n \n\nThe United States expects a confrontation with China over Chinese\nexpansionism in the South China Sea, including its occupation of the disputed\nSpratlys, Rep. Roilo Golez ( LAMP, Para&ntilde;aque) said yesterday. \n\n \n\nHe said documents and information shared with him by US Rep. Dana\nRohrabacher ( Republican, California) and the American lawmaker 's staff\nindicate that the US  \" expects a showdown with China over the\nSouth China Sea issue within 15 years or less. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nHe said one document given to him is a recent report to the\nAmerican Congress by US Defense Secretary William Cohen which assesses China 's\nmilitary preparations, particularly in its southern flank. \n\n \n\nGolez quoted the report:  \" Since the early 1990s,\nthe focus of Chinese military strategy has been preparing for potential\nmilitary contingencies along China 's south-eastern flank, especially in the\nTaiwan Strait and South China Sea.\n\n\nThus, China 's goal is to field forces capable of rapidly deploying\nto fight and win a future regional war under high technology conditions along\nChina 's periphery. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nGolez cited another report by Director Richard Fisher of the\nAsian Studies Center of the Heritage Foundation, a US think tank, which noted\nthat China has developed a 16-kilometer range TV-guided anti-ship missile\nthat can be fired from its Z-9 helicopters. \n\n \n\n \" From small platforms in the disputed Spratly\nislands, Z-9s equipped with these missiles would pose a greater threat to\nother claimants and to contiguous international shipping lanes, &rdquo;\n he quoted Fisher 's report as saying. \n\n \n\nHe said the structures he, Rohrabacher and a big group of\nFilipino media men saw when they flew over the Spratlys last Thursday can\nserve as launching platforms for helicopters and missiles. \n\n \n\nAssessing what the Chinese have been doing in the disputed\nislands, Golez, a graduate of the United States Naval Academy and a former\nPhilippine Navy officer, revealed that China is apparently building a small\nnaval base on Mischief Reef and nearby shoals. \n\n \n\n \" They are constructing a circle of huge, concrete,\nhardened structures with radars, guns and helipads and making a mini-navy\nbase, &rdquo;  he said. \n\n \n\nHe said what they saw last Thursday belies the assurance given to\nthe Philippine government by the Chinese ambassador to Manila that China is\njust repairing shelters for its fishermen and that there are no naval ships\nin the area. \n\n \n\nPhotographs and film footage taken by the Golez and Rohrabacher\ngroup showed that there are three Chinese warships anchored at a deep lagoon\nnear Mischief reef. \n\n \n\nGolez said the Rohrabacher visit was a  \" diplomatic\nbreakthrough &rdquo;  that elicited only a  \" very mild,\neven timid response &rdquo;  from China, compared with the loud\nprotest it made when a similar Filipino media group planned to fly over the\ndisputed islands during the Ramos administration. \n\n \n\nPerhaps, this is because the visiting official comes from a super\npower like the US, he said. \n\n \n\nHe said through the Rohrabacher visit, the Philippines was able\nto bring international attention to  \" Chinese incursions and\nbullying &rdquo;  in the Spratlys. \n\n \n\nHe added that the American lawmaker, who is a member of the House\ninternational affairs committee, will submit a report next week on what he\nsaw in the disputed islands. \n\n \n\n \" He promised that he will be our point man in the\nUS Congress in our effort to make international noise and make this an\ninternational issue to let the world know how a giant power like China is\nbullying a weak, small country like the Philippines, which is simply\nprotecting its exclusive economic zone, &rdquo;  Golez stressed. \n\n \n\nHe announced plans to visit the US Congress early next week to\nbrief other American lawmakers on the situation in the Spratlys. \n\n \n\n \" This is part of the noise barrage that can be our\nbest defense weapon,\"  he said. \n\n \n\nHe said the dispute over the Spratlys cannot be settled in\nbilateral negotiations  \" because the Chinese will just stare us\ndown, bludgeon us with their weight, and continue and continue doing what\nthey have been doing. &rdquo;   \n\n\n\n\n  Noynoy: My dad used RP passport  \n\n\n Jose Rodel Clapano \n\n \n\nTarlac Rep. Benigno \" Noynoy &rdquo; Aquino III denied\nclaims yesterday by former First Lady Imelda Marcos that his late father and\nnamesake was carrying a US passport when he returned to the country in 1983.\n\n\n \n\nThe young Aquino said that Mrs. Marcos was merely raising the\npossibility of US involvement in his father 's return as a ploy to divert\nattention from her own possible involvement in the former senator 's\nassassination in August that year. \n\n \n\nHe said the former first lady was also trying to discredit his\nfather. \n\n \n\n \" My father could not ( have gotten) the support of\nthe US government because he had been suspected as a potential terrorist when\nhe went to the US, &rdquo;  Aquino said, adding his namesake was even\ninvestigated because of his alleged links to Philippine communist rebels.\n\n\n \n\nHe dismissed the allegations of Mrs. Marcos, saying she was\ndesperately trying to spare the Marcoses from blame for the death of the\nopposition leader, who was assassinated upon his return to the Philippines on\nAug. 21, 1983. \n\n \n\n \" Imelda is very difficult to understand and hard\nto follow, &rdquo;  Aquino told \"  The STAR \n\" . \n\n \n\nAquino said that his father - - who began his US exile in 1980 in\nDallas, Texas after being allowed by the Marcos administration to undergo\nheart surgery - - had two Philippine passports prior to his return to the\ncountry. \n\n \n\n \" One was expired and the other was provided by one\nof the people sympathetic to my father, &rdquo;  Aquino said. \n\n \n\nHe noted that the Philippine passport provided to Ninoy by one of\nhis   \" sympathizers &rdquo;  was a \n\" blank passport. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" The man who provided the blank passport to my\nfather was . ...one who had the capacity to issue a Philippine passport,\n&rdquo;  said Aquino, who declined to reveal the identity of the man\n \" because his life might be placed in danger. &rdquo; \n\n\n \n\nDuring Ninoy Aquino 's three-year stay in the US from 1980 to\n1983, Noynoy said that his father did not seek permanent residency status nor\ndid he apply as an immigrant to the US. \n\n \n\n \" He merely renewed his permit to stay in the US\nevery six months at the Immigration and Naturalization Service, &rdquo;\n said the solon, adding that at that time the senator was conducting\na study on how to return the Philippines to democracy after years of\ndictatorial rule. \n\n \n\nThe other day, Mrs. Marcos questioned the whereabouts of Ninoy\nAquino 's passport which he used during his fatal return home. \n\n \n\n \" Where is that passport now? &rdquo;  she\nasked, noting that the passport failed to turn up in previous investigations\nof the murder. \n\n \n\nShe claimed that even \"  Time  \"\nmagazine Asia bureau chief Sandra Burton testified that the senator was\ncarrying a US passport, bolstering her earlier statements that the US had a\nhand in the events leading to his homecoming.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ea95f01a-410d-402e-bb07-a392e41182f8", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.274306+00:00"}
{"text": "Formula for rebel groups  \n\n\n Perseus Echeminada  , + four others\n\n \n\nSenate President  Pro Tempore  Blas Ople\nrecommended yesterday the use of what he called the \" \" Peru\nformula &rdquo; \" in dealing with the insurgency problems posed by\nthe Communist Party of the Philippines and its military arm, the New People 's\nArmy ( NPA), as well as the  Moro  Islamic Liberation Front (\nMILF). \n\n \n\nOple said the Peru formula includes a vigorous program of social\njustice, job generation and food security. \n\n \n\n \" The \" 'bullet and bayonet' approach\n\" alone will not extinguish the communist insurgency, &rdquo;\n Ople stressed. \n\n \n\nHe said the Peru formula was akin to the land reform strategy\nemployed by former President Ramon Magsaysay Sr. to lure  Hukbalahap\n guerrillas into surrendering and returning to the mainstream of\nsociety. \n\n \n\nOple noted that the Peru government successfully crushed the\n Luminoso Sendero  or \" Shining Path &rdquo; rebels\nby addressing the root cause of the rebellion: poverty. \n\n \n\nOple said the failure of the national and local governments in the\nPhilippines to provide basic services to the people has driven thousands to\nthe hills and led them to join the communist and Muslim secessionist\nmovements. \n\n \n\nOple pointed out that the NPA, which started in the early ' 70s,\nand the  Luminoso Sendero  rebellion were the\nlongest-running insurgencies in the world. \n\n \n\n \" Peru has so far crippled the movement of the\nShining Path, but the Philippines has yet to crush the MILF and the NPA\nmovements, &rdquo;  Ople said. \n\n \n\nHe added that the NPA was able to retain most of its so-called\ncontrolled territories over the past two years. \n\n \n\nMeanwhile, security officials said both the NPA and MILF have\nbeen beefing up their forces even as they continue to dangle an olive branch\nbefore the government. \n\n \n\nBrig. Gen. Jose Calimlim, head of the military 's intelligence\nservice, said the NPA has reestablished itself in areas where it has been\ndriven out, specifically in the provinces north and south of Metro Manila.\n\n\n \n\nCalimlim issued the observation after emerging from the first\nmeeting of the National Security Council ( NSC) under the Estrada\nadministration. \n\n \n\nCalimlim pointed out that NPA rebels were even spotted in areas\nwhere they have not been active in the past. \n\n \n\nHe blamed the swelling of the NPA 's ranks to the reduction of\ncommunity-based militias and the absence of government agencies in remote\nareas. \n\n \n\nFor his part, National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre said\nthe separatist MILF has also been strengthening its forces while pursuing\npreliminary peace talks with the government. \n\n \n\nDespite the buildup, Aguirre said the MILF still wants the peace\nprocess to go on. \n\n \n\nThe NSC agreed to pursue the peace process with both camps while\nat the same time implementing a security and development strategy to address\nthe socio-economic and political concerns fueling the insurgency.\n\n\nHe did not elaborate. \n\n \n\nThe communist rebels have been holding peace negotiations with\nthe government since 1992, but talks have been repeatedly delayed over\ndifferences in the terms and conditions of the peace accord. \n\n \n\nThe military claims the NPA 's strength has dwindled from a peak\nof 25,000 in the mid-1980s to only about 6,000 in 1997. \n\n \n\nOn the other hand, the MILF has an estimated armed force of about\n11,900 fighters. \n\n \n\nThe two rebel groups were left out of a peace agreement forged in\n1996 between the government and the mainstream  Moro  National\nLiberation Front ( MNLF). \n\n \n\nIn spite of the government 's peace initiatives in Mindanao,\nsporadic fighting between soldiers and MILF rebels continues to ravage the\nSouth. \n\n\n  Clashes continue in Maguindanao  \n\n \n\nGovernment troops and MILF fighters traded mortar and artillery\nfire anew the other day in Maguindanao. \n\n \n\nThe Army 's 6th Infantry Division said some 100 MILF guerrillas\npounded a camp of the 39th Infantry Division in Buldon town with 81-mm.\nmortars. \n\n \n\nCol. Rafael Romero, civil-military operations chief of the Armed\nForces Southeastern Command ( Southcom), said the troops responded with heavy\nmortar firing in various MILF positions. \n\n \n\nRomero said the bombardment continued into the night as the\nrebels amassed at their so-called \" \" defensive perimeters\n&rdquo; \" in Buldon. \n\n \n\nThe sporadic fighting between the two camps broke out last\nSaturday, but no reports of casualties on either side were made. \n\n \n\nSouthcom reported that hundreds of villagers fled their homes in\nTalayan town where a major MILF lair, Camp Omar, is located. \n\n \n\nThe military has deployed over 2,000 soldiers in Maguindanao.\n\n\n \n\nMeanwhile, MILF vice chairman for military affairs Al Haj Murad\nurged Armed Forces chief Gen. Joselin Nazareno to conduct a thorough probe of\nthe ongoing fighting in Central Mindanao. \n\n \n\n \" I believe Gen. Nazareno is not fully aware of\nwhat is happening here, &rdquo;  Murad said. \n\n \n\nHe accused Southcom Chief Lt. Gen. Angelo Reyes and 6th ID\ncommander Maj. Gen. Rolando Bautista of triggering the latest attacks on MILF\nheadquarters in  Datu  Piang town, Maguindanao. \n\n \n\n \" We do not understand it anymore.\n\n\nThe military has been launching these attacks on our posts even if\nthe ceasefire agreement is ( still) in effect, &rdquo;  Murad said.\n\n\n \n\nHe also charged that the military hierarchy has been \n\" grossly politicized,\"  with some commanders creating crisis\nscenarios and issuing contradicting statements about the peace and order\nsituation in the South. \n\n \n\nMurad claimed MILF guerrillas were directed to maintain a\ndefensive stance, but fight back  \" when pushed against the\nwall. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nIn another development, residents of Butuan City expressed alarm\nover the reports that the MILF and the MNLF have set up training camps in a\nremote  barangay  of the city and some parts of the Caraga\nregion. \n\n \n\nEarlier, military intelligence reports indicated that the MNLF\nhas also established a recruitment and training center in San Miguel town,\nSurigao del Sur. \n\n \n\nCol. Roland Amarille, commander of the Army 's 67th Infantry\nBattalion based in San Miguel, warned local residents against the MNLF 's\nrecruitment activity. \n\n \n\nLast October, some MNLF fighters led by a certain Abdul Hadji\nNikabulin reportedly visited San Miguel and Butuan Cuty aboard a convoy of\ntrucks. \n\n \n\nAmarille challenged the visitors, who introduced themselves as\nemissaries of MNLF chieftain and Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao Gov.\nNur Misuari, to present their credentials. \n\n \n\nMNLF Maj. Pedro Lora, a devout Catholic and an active member of\nthe Knights of Columbus, confirmed to \"  The STAR \n\" that they were recruiting jobless people, including Christians.\n\n\n \" We don't want to put our peaceful city and region\ninto jeopardy.\n\n\nOur brother Muslims only want to establish brotherhood here, &rdquo;\n Lora said. \n\n \n\nCalling themselves the \" \" Mindanao Composite Task\nForce Command -  Bangsa Moro  Armed Forces, &rdquo; \"\nMNLF Maj. Frank Delima added their group exists only for brotherhood and\nlivelihood cooperativism. \n\n \n\nAmarille insisted, however, that the group might have a sinister\nmotive, adding that he has initiated an investigation into the possibility\nthat the group could consist of MILF guerrillas posing as MNLF members. \n\n\n\n\n\n  Where is Ninoy 's passport?  \n\n\n Perseus Echeminada \n\n \n\nFormer First Lady Imelda Marcos dared yesterday former President\nCorazon Aquino and former Vice President Salvador Laurel as well as close\nfriends of the late Sen. Benigno Aquino Jr. to reveal how deeply involved the\nUS government was in the planning and the execution of the senator 's return\nto Manila in 1983. \n\n \n\n \" The late businessman Vicente 'Teng' Puyat told me\nand many others that when he was with a select group in the US planning the\ncircuitous itinerary of Aquino to Manila, there were at least two Americans\nwho represented the US government in that meeting, &rdquo;  Mrs.\nMarcos said. \n\n \n\nImelda 's claim is bolstered by the testimonies of \" \nTime  \" magazine Asia bureau chief Sandra Burton, who told the\nAgrava Commission and the two subsequent  Sandiganbayan \ninvestigations that Aquino carried a US passport. \n\n \n\nBurton said the opposition leader showed his passport to a dozen\nAmerican journalists inside a hotel room in Taipei on Aug. 20, 1983, or a day\nbefore he was shot dead at the then Manila International Airport. \n\n \n\n \" Where is that passport now? &rdquo;  the\nMarcos widow asked.\n\n\n \" Why did the Agrava Commission and the subsequent\nprobes not seek to locate and recover it? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nShe continued:  \" Who gave such a passport to Ninoy,\nand why are his family and friends quiet about it? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Apparently, there are many questions that were\nnever asked and which are now begging for answers, &rdquo;  she said.\n\n\n \n\n \" We beg the people who know anything about this to\nplease come forward in order for the country to be rid of this ghost once and\nfor all, &rdquo;  Mrs. Marcos added.\n\n\n \" They should tell the truth. ...no matter who gets\nhurt. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" I am sure the Aquino family, deep in their\nhearts, want the truth to come out as much as the Marcoses do, too, &rdquo;\n she said. \n\n \n\nEarlier, the Marcos widow dragged the US in Aquino 's slay,\nsaying its government misled and misinformed the Marcoses about his\nwhereabouts even on the day of the murder. \n\n \n\nThe Marcos widow stressed that even while the China Airlines\nplane carrying Aquino and several journalists were about to land at the then\nManila International Airport on Aug. 21,  \" the highest official\nat the US Embassy at that time was still assuring me on the telephone that\ntheir intelligence reports indicate that the former senator was still in the\nUS. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nImelda was referring to a certain Minister Rich, who answered\nMrs. Marcos ' queries when then US Ambassador Michael Armacost was reportedly\nout of his office. \n\n \n\n \" I find it hard to believe that the US Federal\nBureau of Investigation and the US Central Intelligence Agency were unaware\nof Ninoy 's whereabouts, while all American news agencies knew exactly where\nNinoy was at that time, &rdquo;  Mrs. Marcos said. \n\n \n\nIn another development yesterday, a Marcos lawyer said Sen. Juan\nPonce Enrile would be the lead counsel in Mrs. Marcos ' fight for the\n&peso;500-billion asset. \n\n \n\nLawyer Antonio Tupaz said he and other lawyers are now\nconsolidating pieces of evidence that would prove the Marcos family 's\nownership of several companies through the cronies. \n\n \n\nTupaz 's statement contradicted earlier claims of Enrile that he\nis on leave as a lawyer at the law firm. \n\n \n\nEnrile told reporters earlier that he would only provide legal\nadvice to the Marcoses.  \n\n\n\n\n  Erap cuts Leo 's lifeline  \n\n\n Marichu Villanueva \n\n \n\n On the eve of the country 's first judicial execution in\n23 years, President Estrada cut his telephone hotline to the lethal injection\nchamber in Muntinlupa, denying condemned Leo Echegaray any chance of a\nlast-minute reprieve.  \n\n \n\n \" I had it cut, &rdquo;  Mr. Estrada told\nreporters yesterday.\n\n\n \" I had talked to Bureau of Prisons Director Pedro\nSistoza and I told him not to expect phone calls from me.\n\n\nThey don't have to wait for any call. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nExecutive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said precautionary measures\nhave also been put in place in case pranksters mimic the voice of the\nPresident and order a stay in the execution.\n\n\nOne such measure is for Sistoza to verify any call from\nMalaca&ntilde;ang. \n\n \n\nPresident Estrada said that he would just pray  \"\nthree Our Fathers, three Hail Marys, and three Glory Bes &rdquo;  for\nEchegaray 's soul. \n\n \n\nEchegaray, a 38-year-old former house painter and father of\nthree, is scheduled to be put to death by lethal injection at 3 p.m. today\nfor repeatedly raping his stepdaughter when she was 10 years old in 1994.\n\n\n \n\nHe maintains that the rape charges stemmed from a property\ndispute with the mother of his former live-in partner. \n\n \n\nMr. Estrada, who has rejected appeals from the Vatican, the\nEuropean community, Canada and the London-based human rights group Amnesty\nInternational, said he will  \" feel good\"  after the\nexecution  \" because it will be protecting several innocent\npeople. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" As President, I have to follow the rule of law,\nto implement the law, &rdquo;  he said. \n\n \n\n \" I 've got to be firm to send a message to future\nrapists that we mean business.\n\n\nNo one will change my mind, &rdquo;  the President added.\n\n\n \n\nPrison officials said everything is ready for Echegaray 's\nexecution.\n\n\nThere will be three injections administered one after the other.\n\n\nThe first induces sleep, the second relaxes the muscles and the third\nstops the heartbeat. \n\n \n\nPrisons spokesman Superintendent Rosendo Tesoro said Echegaray\nended his one-week fast following an appeal from the prisons chaplain for the\ncondemned man to eat because an empty stomach might extend the time for the\ndrugs to take effect and make it more painful for Echegaray to die. \n\n \n\nEchegaray only took vitamins, water and soda crackers last week\nin a protest to profess his innocence. \n\n \n\nPrisons chaplain Fr. Roberto Olaguer told the condemned man that\na full stomach would make it easier for his body to absorb the first dose of\nthe lethal injection.\n\n\nIf Echegaray 's body rejects the first shot,  \" he would\nfeel pain, &rdquo;  the priest said. \n\n \n\nAfter the execution, the child rapist 's remains would be brought\nto a funeral parlor in Valenzuela City. \n\n \n\nAn official there said they expect thousands of people to view\nEchegaray 's remains, posing a problem to the rapist 's family as well as to\nthe police.\n\n\nThe official said they might have to screen those who wish to see the\nremains of the 38-year-old child rapist. \n\n \n\nAs prisons officials prepare the death chamber, Echegaray packed\nhis personal belongings, which consist of several pairs of pants, shirts, a\nrosary, a bible, a stuffed toy, several towels and seven pairs of panties.\n\n\n \n\nZenaida Javier, who married Echegaray last December, said his\nhusband  \" still cannot accept death. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" He will not accept death because he is innocent,\n&rdquo;  she said. \n\n\nShe carried a pink rose and visited her husband for the last time\nyesterday with officials prohibiting any more visits. \n\n \n\nJavier resisted being pulled out from Echegaray 's cell, until\nshe fainted and was rushed to the prison hospital. \n\n \n\nWhen she regained her consciousness, Sistoza ordered Javier out\nof the hospital, saying execution rules disallow relatives from visiting a\ncondemned man on the eve of the execution date. \n\n \n\nA brownout happened inside the compound of the New \nBilibid  Prisons ( NBP) yesterday afternoon but jail officials\nimmediately denied that it was intentionally done to disrupt the execution of\nEchegaray. \n\n \n\nThe power failure started at around 2:30 p. m. to 4 p.m.\n\n\nOfficials said it was due to trouble in electrical lines. \n\n \n\nAlso, at around 6 p.m., all cells of the prisoners were\npadlocked to prevent them from causing troubles and protest actions. \n\n \n\nAll cells will be opened only on Saturday morning. \n\n \n\nMany Filipinos back the death penalty because of exasperation\nover widespread crime.\n\n\nBut others, led by the Catholic Church, say there is no proof that\ncapital punishment reduces crime. \n\n \n\nJustice Undersecretary Ramon Liwag suggested that the government\nput up a panel that would study whether or not the death penalty is really a\ndeterrent to crime. \n\n \n\n \" It 's about time that the government conduct an\nhonest-to-goodness survey on this issue.\n\n\nIt should be well-studied and well-structured survey, &rdquo;\n he said.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "925ef592-aa64-4292-8dec-ecf6a9d77d57", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.275594+00:00"}

Marfil \n\n \n\nReceding floodwaters in four provinces in Mindanao allowed\nrescuers to finally distribute relief goods and save stranded villagers from\nrooftops and trees yesterday. \n\n \n\nFlash floods triggered by heavy and incessant rains in the\nCagayan Autonomous Region and Growth Area ( Caraga) killed 17 persons while\nthree others were reported missing. \n\n \n\nDefense Secretary Orlando Mercado led government officials in\ndistributing relief goods to victims. \n\n\n  Logging did this  \n\n \n\nMercado, Environment Secretary Antonio Cerilles and Surigao Rep.\nRobert Ace Barbers blamed illegal loggers for the flash floods. \n\n \n\nBarbers, whose own district was hit hard by chest-high floods,\nurged his colleagues in the House to pass a law that will classify illegal\nlogging as a heinous crime punishable by death. \n\n \n\n \" This disastrous calamity would not have\ntranspired if we were more responsible in preserving the trees in the area\nand if we were more sensitive toward the needs of future generations, &rdquo;\n Barbers said as he accused selfish businessmen in cahoots with\ncorrupt Department of the Environment and Natural Resources officials for the\ndeaths and damage. \n\n \n\nAccording to the defense secretary, illegal logging activities\nseverely denuded the forests surrounding the Agusan River, the country 's\nsecond largest river, making the area prone to such sudden and devastating\nfloods. \n\n\n  Damage reports  \n\n \n\nOut of 87,402 families ( 402,900 persons) registered by the\nDepartment of Social Welfare and Development as adversely affected by flash\nfloods in Caraga, only 22.59 percent of affected families received relief and\nassistance from the DSWD. \n\n \n\nThe DSWD Disaster Response Operations Monitoring and Information\nService ( DROMIC) said the remaining 67,703 unserved families refused to\nleave their properties. \n\n \n\nOf the casualties listed by disaster relief personnel, DROMIC\nsaid 17 bodies were recovered and three others are missing, but have not been\ndeclared dead. \n\n \n\nFamily members of 10 of the fatalities positively identified the\nvictims as Gaudencio Lagbas, 19; Denci Lobo, 4; Virgilio Villana; Riche\nGracasic, 12, all of Agusan del Norte; in Agusan del Sur, those declared dead\nwere Romilyn Mabandas, 19; Fil Jineta 12; Jinel Asipa, 13; Alex Malasang\nApalle, 27, and Analyn and Lovely Curato, 13 and 8, respectively. \n\n \n\nSome 550 homes were damaged, 88 of which were totally destroyed.\n\n\nBut Caraga officials said they are unsure how long their supplies\nwill last, because they do not know how long evacuees will remain in the\nshelters. \n\n \n\nThese flash floods have damaged crops worth &peso;44.98 million,\nthe Department of Agriculture ( DA) reported. \n\n \n\nA damage report from the Presidential  La Ni&ntilde;a\n Task Force said that damage to crops alone totalled &peso;21.8\nmillion and that the floods ravaged over 7,200 hectares of farmlands. \n\n \n\nMeanwhile, in Region X, a total of 559 families ( 2,643 persons)\nwere displaced by similar floods in Balinsag and Cagayan de Oro City. \n\n \n\nThe provincial government there had already extended relief\namounting to &peso;48,440. \n\n\n  Environmental calamity area  \n\n \n\nThe DENR declared the entire Caraga region an \" \"\nenvironmental calamity area &rdquo; \" following the heavy rains and\nfloods. \n\n \n\nCerilles suspended all mining and forestry permits and licenses\nthere as part of the department 's remedial and flood control measures.\n\n\nThese permits and licenses will remain suspended until the DENR has\nmade a thorough review of the damage wrought by the  La Ni&ntilde;a\n spawned floods. \n\n \n\nHe also warned that  \" the next cycle of rains could\ntrigger another massive flooding and so we must do something about the\nproblem now.\n\n\nThe damage assessment report is crucial in undertaking such measures.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nPresident Estrada earlier placed Caraga under a state of calamity\nand ordered all concerned government agencies to conduct relief and\nrehabilitation work there. \n\n \n\nAgriculture Secretary William Dar said his department has set\naside &peso;20 million to help farmers affected by the floods.\n\n\nThis money, Dar said, will be used for purchasing farm equipment such\nas mechanical dryers, rice threshers, corn shellers and other post-harvest\nfacilities and farm equipment.\n\n\n Palay  , corn, grafted  durian \nseedlings and other crop seedlings suitable to the affected areas will also\nbe distributed by the DA. \n\n \n\nTo minimize flooding in these areas, Dar has also asked the\nDepartment of Public Works and Highways to dredge critical waste-water areas\nin Caraga.  \n\n\n\n\n  Duty-free soybean imports bucked  \n\n\n Rhea P. Sandique \n\n \n\nA government plan to bring in soybean meal at zero tariff will\ngreatly jeopardize the local soybean processing industry, according to an\nindustry spokesman. \n\n \n\nIn a letter to Agriculture Secretary William Dar, Ric Pinca,\ncorporate affairs director of General Milling Corporation, claimed the\nimportation of soybean meal tax-free could even mean the end of the entire\nindustry. \n\n \n\n \" The plan to allow importation of soybean at zero\nduty will kill the local soybean processing industry and unnecessarily place\nthe country 's food security in the hands of foreign soybean processors and\ntraders whose greed for profit show no mercy nor consideration for the\ncountry 's needs, &rdquo;  Pinca said. \n\n \n\nThe duty-free importation of soybean meal, according to the DA,\nis under Section 109 of the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act.\n\n\nCovered by the duty-free provision of AFMA are commodities identified\nas an important input to enhance farm production in the country. \n\n \n\nPrior to the AFMA implementation, the duty-free provision of AFMA\nin the case of soybean imports are charged three percent to zero percent.\n\n\n \n\nHowever, Pinca said, the proposal to remove the tariff on soybean\nconstitutes a violation of Section 2 of AFMA which states that \n\" the state shall enhance the competitiveness of the agriculture and\nfisheries sectors in both domestic and foreign markets. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" The proposal to reduce the tariff in soybean, a\nfinished product, reduces the competitiveness of local soybean processing\nindustry against foreign processors and endangers the very survival of the\nindustry that strives to promote local processing and self-sufficiency in the\nsupply of this vital commodity, &rdquo;  Pinca said. \n\n \n\n \" Once local competition is eliminated, suppliers\nwill enjoy a monopoly or stranglehold on the local market, &rdquo; \nhe added. \n\n \n\nAlso, the proposal would place the tariff level of soybean meal,\na finished product, at par with that of soybeans, a raw material.\n\n\n \" This will result in a distortion in the tariff\nstructure with soybeans, a raw material having the same zero duty as soybean\nmeal.\n\n\nRaw materials normally have lower tariff than finished products,\n&rdquo;  he pointed out. \n\n \n\nOn top of these, the government would lose over &peso;216 million\nin annual revenues should tariff on imported soybean meal be reduced to zero,\nPinca said. \n\n \n\nLast year, the country imported over one million metric tons of\nsoybean meal.\n\n\nAt an average landing cost of &dollar;185 per MT and at three-percent\ntariff, the imports were levied a total of &dollar;5.55 million or about\n&peso;216 million. \n\n \n\nDespite the adverse consequences, Pinca said that some DA\nofficials are pushing for the zero tariff on soybean meal.  \n\n\n\n\n  Plastic makers bracing for showdown with petrochem firm\n \n\n \n\nPlastic makers have threatened to boycott local petrochemical\ncompanies that continue to seek protection from government. \n\n \n\nThe Philippine Plastic Industry Association ( PPIA), composed of\n300 firms employing some 300,000 people, made the threat after petrochemical\nfirms supported proposals for government to use higher values in the\ncomputation of tariffs on petrochem products including plastic. \n\n \n\nSources at the PPIA said plastic makers would rather import\nresins ( a raw material in plastic production) instead of buying the material\nfrom local petrochemical firms. \n\n \n\nThe boycott was meant to send a strong message to the\npetrochemical companies that just received tariff protection from government\nwhen duties on resin were raised to 15 percent from 10 percent, PPIA sources\nsaid. \n\n \n\nThe use of the higher values in the computation of tariffs, which\nwill raise the cost of production for the plastic makers, had been supported\nby the National Steel Corporation ( NSC). \n\n \n\nThe plastic makers said they would join forces with the\ndownstream users of steel products. \n\n \n\n \" We are their clients and we should work together\nto develop the industry but they are killing us, &rdquo;  the PPIA\nsource said. \n\n \n\nThe recent round of tariff adjustments has led some sectors to\nbelieve that the government is biased against some industries or\ncorporations. \n\n \n\nThe use of the higher-published values in the computation of\ntariffs, if adopted, will only confirm views that the Estrada administration\nis reverting back to the   padrino   system. \n\n \n\nThe NSC is the main petitioner for the use of the\nhigher-valuation system which is being studied by the Customs valuation team\n( CTV). \n\n \n\nSome quarters fear that the proposal is  \" already\nwritten in stone &rdquo;  because of NSC 's ties with the Department\nof Finance.\n\n\nFinance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu brokered the sale of Wing Tiek\nHoldings  Berhad  's 82.5-percent stake in the NSC to the\nHong Kong-based Hottick Investments Limited.\n\n\nFinance Under-secretary Solomon Cua was once an official of the NSC.\n\n\n \n\nThe DoF had drafted an unnumbered memorandum order containing the\nproposal for the use of higher values in the computation of tariffs which was\npresented to the CVT. \n\n \n\nThe CVT is headed by the Bureau of Customs, an attached agency of\nthe DoF. \n\n \n\nTo make matters worse, the NSC is the only single corporation\nwith a membership in the CVT.\n\n\nOther private sector representatives in the CVT are umbrella\norganizations such as the Federation of Philippine Industries and the\nPhilippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "8ecf967e-b7fb-4e41-aafd-d0fef76a568e", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.276967+00:00"}

Marfil \n\n \n\nA battle of the stars looms at the local government level as\nthree showbiz personalities-turned-politicians are up against\nactor-turned-President Joseph Estrada. \n\n \n\nCaloocan City Mayor Reynaldo Malonzo, a former action star, and\nformer comedians now councilors Tito Valera and Dennis Padilla and seven\nofficials are awaiting the six-month suspension order for alleged\nmalversation of public funds amounting to &peso;39 million. \n\n \n\nPresident Estrada, in his capacity as concurrent secretary of the\nDepartment of Interior and Local Government ( DILG), has yet to sign the\norder based on the recommendation of Undersecretary Ronaldo Puno. \n\n \n\nDILG legal counsel Julius Raboca told \"  Manila\nStandard  \" Mr. Estrada has already received Puno 's\nrecommendation. \n\n \n\nPuno said Malonzo 's admission on double appropriation of funds\nleft him with no choice but to recommend the suspension. \n\n \n\n \" Since he admitted it, we have no option except to\nrecommend the penalty ( of six months suspension).\n\n\nIf he questions the jurisdiction ( over the matter), that is not up\nto us to decide, &rdquo;  Puno said. \n\n \n\nSince the case against Malonzo and company is  \"\nadministrative in nature, it is but natural for them to submit the\nrecommendation to the Office of the President, &rdquo;  Puno said.\n\n\n \n\nMalonzo earlier admitted that his council indeed used the\n&peso;39 million for purposes other than what it was intended for. \n\n \n\nBut he contended Raboca should not be handling their case because\nhe is an alleged ally of Malonzo 's arch-rival, former mayor Macario 'Boy'\nAsistio. \n\n \n\nInstead, Malonzo wanted the Department of Budget and Management\nto give whatever recommendation is needed to Malaca&ntilde;ang. \n\n \n\nHe claimed there was nothing wrong about that since his\npredecessor Asistio had been doing the same thing anyway.\n\n\nBesides, Administrative Order 4 signed by then President and \nLakas  partymate Fidel Ramos, gave local chief executives the power\nto move or transfer funds. \n\n \n\nThe administrative case Malonzo is facing stemmed from a\ncomplaint of Eduardo Tibor,  barangay  secretary and an\nalleged supporter of former mayor Asistio. \n\n \n\nTibor filed dishonesty, abuse of authority, misconduct for\nalleged conspiracy of the city officials in passing city ordinance 9254 that\ntransferred some &peso;39 million unexpected fund to support the supplemental\nbudget of the city in 1998. \n\n \n\nThe amount was taken from the original &peso;50 million budget\nallotted for the construction of a bus terminal along North Diversion Road.\n\n\n \n\nThe project did not materialize, since Malabon officials claimed\nthe 89-hectare lot where the terminal was supposed to be built was their\nproperty and not Caloocan 's. \n\n \n\nThus, Caloocan officials reverted the &peso;39 million fund to\nits supplemental budget for salary, cash gift and incentives for casual and\nregular employees of the city hall. \n\n \n\nThe six other erring local government officials are Vice Mayor\nOscar Malapitan, councilors Chito Abel, Benjamin Manlapig, Edgar Erice, Zaldy\nDolatre, Susan Punzalan and Henry Cammayo. \n\n \n\nIf the suspension pushes through, Caloocan residents fear that\nthere will be a breakdown in the delivery of basic services.\n\n\nFor one, garbage will not be collected. \n\n \n\nThis is because  \" we have yet to pass the annual\ncity budget for the year\",  Malonzo said, and  \"\ncontractors will think twice before transacting with the city government\nbecause there is no allotted budget for the operation. &rdquo;  \n\n\n\n\n\n  Duterte resignation may be rejected  \n\n\n Fel Maragay \n\n \n\nDavao City Rep. Rodrigo Duterte 's planned resignation is a big\nmistake, President Estrada said yesterday, as he tried to dissuade the former\nfrom renouncing his congressional seat. \n\n \n\nDuterte, a known political ally of the President, said he is\nquitting to prove he is not using his position to protect his eldest son,\nPaolo, who is in trouble for allegedly beating up a hotel security guard on\nJan. 27. \n\n \n\n \" I don't think he should resign.\n\n\nThe fault of the son is not the fault of the father and vice versa,\n&rdquo;  the President told Malaca&ntilde;ang reporters. \n\n \n\nDuterte announced he was resigning as congressman after Davao\nCity commentator Juan \" Jun &rdquo; Pala criticized him for allegedly\n \" covering up\"  his son 's  \" misdeeds.\"\n \n\n \n\nSpeaker Manny Villar endorsed Duterte 's letter of resignation to\nthe Office of the Secretary General. \n\n \n\nLast night, Duterte said he was not backtracking on his decision.\n\n\nBut he sounded contradictory when he said he was leaving his fate to\nthe House committee on rules. \n\n \n\n \" It 's out of my hands, &rdquo;  he said.\n\n\n \n\nExecutive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora revealed that the President\nhad asked the Speaker to turn down the resignation.\n\n\nVillar was present at the meeting between Duterte and Mr. Estrada.\n\n\n \n\nZamora denied speculation that Duterte was resigning to accept an\noffer of the President to appoint him presidential assistant for Mindanao.\n\n\n \n\nZamora said this position had been offered to Duterte last year\nbut the latter declined  \" for personal reasons. &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\n \" I don't know whether he will now be more inclined\nat this point ( to accept the offer) having submitted his resignation,\n&rdquo;  the executive secretary said. \n\n \n\nZamora said if Duterte is indeed determined to quit, not even the\nPresident can stop him. \n\n \n\n \" If he wants to resign, then obviously he is free\nto do so.\n\n\nBut he has to do a lot of explaining to his constituents because he\ngot himself elected only nine months ago, &rdquo;  he said. \n\n \n\nVillar concurred in a separate statement, saying,  \"\nRep. Duterte 's covenant is between him and the people in his district who\ngave him their full support. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nSen. Miriam Defensor Santiago reacted to the news in a privilege\nspeech, opining that any senator or representative has the right to resign,\nas protected by the due process clause and the equal protection clause of the\nConstitution. \n\n \n\nHowever, she said, he should wait until his resignation is\naccepted, or else he could be jailed for abandonment of office. \n\n \n\nZamora added that a special election may be called to fill the\nvacancy that may be created should Duterte 's resignation be accepted. \n\n\n\n\n\n  Global investors snap up &dollar;450m worth of RP bonds\n \n\n\n Jay-Anne E. Dancel \n\n \n\nThe Philippine government raised another &dollar;200 million from\nthe international capital market Monday night through the issuance of 20-year\nglobal bonds, Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said yesterday. \n\n \n\nInvestors snapped up the bond issue just a day after they\nsubscribed to &dollar;250 million worth of eurobonds, a separate issuance\nfrom the  Bangko Central ng Pilipinas  . \n\n \n\nThe latest bond flotation was on top of the &dollar;500 million\nalso in global bonds which were issued last month.\n\n\nThus, the global bonds had already yielded &dollar;700-million for\nthe Estrada administration. \n\n \n\nIn an interview yesterday, Espiritu said:  \" We were\nable to get it at a better spread than the first one.\n\n\nAnd again, it was oversubscribed with only eight investors getting\ntheir hands on the &dollar;200-million additional issue. &rdquo; \n\n\n \n\nThe &dollar;200-million bonds were priced at 9.787 percent, or\n436 basis points over the benchmark US Treasury.\n\n\nThe latest bond float was cheaper compared to the original issue\nyield of 10.072 percent. \n\n \n\nEspiritu noted the additional issuance would replace the proposed\nflotation of &dollar;250 million convertible bonds representing the\ngovernment 's stake in the Lopez-controlled Manila Electric Co. \n\n \n\n \" The re-opening was executed quickly and quietly,\ntaking advantage of an attractive window of opportunity amid a volatile\nmarket, &rdquo;  the finance chief said in a statement.\n\n\nThe joint lead managers and bookrunners for the transaction were JP\nMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Warburg Dillon Read. \n\n \n\n \" While the transaction was heavily driven by US\naccounts, it underscored strong global investor demand for Philippine bonds\nby pricing within 24 hours of another sovereign issue from the Republic,\n&rdquo;  Espiritu said.\n\n\nHe was referring to the two-year &dollar;250-million eurobonds issued\nby the  Bangko Central ng Pilipinas  last Monday which were\nsold mostly to Asian investors. \n\n \n\nThe original 20-year &dollar;500-million issue was launched\ntogether with a 10-year float also worth &dollar;500 million bringing the\ntotal global bond issue to &dollar;1 billion. \n\n \n\nFormer Finance Secretary Salvador Enriquez Jr. earlier criticized\nthe Estrada administration for heavily relying on foreign borrowings amid the\ncontinued volatility in the currency markets. \n\n \n\n \" We should consider that foreign debts while\ncheaper expose us to foreign exchange risks.\n\n\nOn the other hand, it appears that we still have to see some serious\nefforts in improving revenues, &rdquo;  he noted. \n\n \n\nThe government shifted to foreign borrowings to finance its\nbudget deficit projected to reach &peso;68.4 billion this year. \n\n \n\nEspiritu said the proceeds of the additional bond issue to be\nremitted by February 16 would be used for the Pasig River Development\nProject. \n\n \n\nAside from the global bond issue, the Philippine government is\nalso firming up a euro-denominated bond issue worth at least &dollar;500\nmillion by the end of the month. \n\n \n\nEspiritu said the government could even increase the\neuro-denominated bond issue depending on the general market conditions. \n\n \n\n \" I want to make it flexible from &dollar;500\nmillion to so much. ...depending on the pricing and the market just like what\nwe did with the &dollar;1-billion issue which had been originally &dollar;500\nmillion, then increased to &dollar;750 million.\n\n\nIf the reaction is good, then we can ( increase it), &rdquo; \nhe said.  \n\n\n\n\n  Pardo wants garments quota system abolished  \n\n\n Eileen A. Mencias \n\n \n\nTrade Secretary Jose Pardo yesterday ordered the Garments Export\nand Textile Board ( GETB) to do away with the system of allocating garments\nexport quotas. \n\n \n\n \" I want to dismantle the quota system in garments\nto give the small ones a chance, &rdquo;  Pardo told reporters. \n\n \n\nPardo directed the GETB and Trade Undersecretary Nelly\nVillafuerte to review the system and come up with the recommendations on the\nissue. \n\n \n\nThe GETB had been under fire over its practice of farming out\ngarments exports quota which was said to be a source of graft and corruption\nin the agency. \n\n \n\nSome 70 percent of the country 's garments exports, or over\n&dollar;2 billion, is shipped out under the quota system which assures\nPhilippine garments manufacturers of a ready market.\n\n\nThese markets are the United States, Canada and Europe. \n\n \n\nPhilippine garments exports reached only &dollar;2.9 billion\nlast year, or a zero growth from 1997 levels.\n\n\nVillafuerte estimates the figure to drop to just &dollar;2 billion\nthis year as shipments to non-quota countries shrink due to stiff competition\nfrom Mexico, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and other countries. \n\n \n\nHistorically, 85 percent of the quota goes to garments\nmanufacturers that have a track record of exports.\n\n\nThe 15 percent is bidded out. \n\n \n\nPardo questioned the bidding for the remaining 15 percent\nbecause even those with a share in the 85 percent are still allowed to bid.\n\n\n \n\n \" The name of the game is denying the \nstatus quo  , &rdquo;  Pardo said. \n\n \n\nThe government just recently moved to dismantle the allocation\nof the imports of sugar under the so-called minimum access volume scheme\nunder which a limited group corner the bulk of the importation.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "08c9eac8-efe6-4f5e-b0c3-01070c34d6df", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.278150+00:00"}

Vicente Sotto, chairman of the committee on public service,\nasked phone officials including PLDT president Manuel Pangilinan to come up\nwith a  \" special arrangement\"  on the telemetering\nscheme to lessen the impact on the business and public subscribers. \n\n \n\nPangilinan said the proposal might lead to legal problems. \n\n \n\n \" The potential issue on the selective scheme is\nthat we might be accused of favoring one at the expense of the other, &rdquo;\n he said. \n\n \n\nHe said a universally applied metering scheme will \n\" correct the long-standing abuse against responsible users across all\nincome groups. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" The current flat rate scheme forces low income\nusers to subsidize high-volume users.\n\n\nIn a metered scheme, consumers will pay for what they actually use\nand not on top of that, what others abuse, &rdquo;  he said. \n\n \n\nUnder the scheme, subscribers will pay 40 centavos in excess of\nthe 800 free minutes per month charged with a flat rate of &peso;348 a month\nfor residential subscribers and &peso;748 for business subscribers. \n\n \n\nBy charging higher rates for peak usage periods and discounted\nrates for non-peak periods, Pangilinan said, the introduction of LMS should\nencourage responsible, optimum use of the network.\n\n\nA higher number of users can then be accommodated by a given network,\nhe said. \n\n \n\nIn the Philippines, it is likely that demand will come from the\nhigher-income, better-educated customers who are able to afford the proposed\nper minute rates, Pangilinan said. \n\n \n\nPangilinan said LMS will promote responsible telephone use and\nphone network efficiency. \n\n \n\nBasically, he also said, PLDT needed to raise through LMS its\nrevenues from local telephone operations to offset the reduced income from\nits international long distance service, which has been subsidizing local\ncalls. \n\n \n\nHe said PLDT can no longer afford to subsidize local operations\nbecause foreign governments like the US have lowered the rates of their\ntelephone companies, forcing PLDT to reduce its foreign and international\nlong distance rates to stay competitive. \n\n \n\nBesides, he said, it is time that the company rebalance its\ntariff and expenditures figures. \n\n \n\nPLDT expects to raise its gross revenue by &peso;3 billion in a\nyear. \n\n \n\nPangilinan also said it is ironic that the Internet Service\nProviders have raised the metering issue since ISPs themselves charge their\nclients metered rates. \n\n \n\nPangilinan said anyone who has a computer and Internet access can\nafford LMS. \n\n \n\nHe said LMS will promote a more productive use of the Internet\nrather than just  \" surfing around &rdquo;  which he\nsaid can be hardly described as educational. \n\n \n\nSenate probers proposed that instead of charging consumers a flat\nrate, PLDT and other companies charge subscribers on how often and how long\nthey use the phone. \n\n \n\nSen. Juan Ponce Enrile said the proposed local measured services\nis inequitable considering that a flat rate will be imposed on consumers.\n\n\n \n\n \" I accept that there 's inequity.\n\n\nA residential household for example would only use 200 minutes while\nanother would use up the entire 800 minutes.\n\n\nThey do not have uniform consumption but both would pay &peso;348 per\nmonth, &rdquo;  Enrile said.  \n\n\n\n\n  FM wealth: Back to where it all began  \n\n\n Evangeline C. de Vera and Aresti Tanglao \n\n \n\nIf the government and the Marcos family fail to reach an amicable\nsettlement before the life of the Presidential Commission on Good Government\n( PCGG) expires, they may have to face off again, this time in a courtroom.\n\n\n \n\nPresident Estrada said as much yesterday as he reacted to reports\nthat the PCGG, after 13 years of failure to recover the so-called ill-gotten\nwealth of the Marcoses, is now readying itself for a showdown by hiring a\nbattery of lawyers. \n\n \n\n \" Well, of course, if there is no settlement we\nhave to pursue the case, &rdquo;  he said in an ambush interview at\nMalaca&ntilde;ang. \n\n \n\nAfter assuming office last June, Estrada gave the PCGG, under\nformer chairman Felix de Guzman and now Magdangal Elma, one year to wrap up\nthe ill-gotten wealth cases lodged against the Marcoses and their alleged\ncronies. \n\n \n\nExecutive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a radio interview that\nEstrada was not keen on extending the life of PCGG.\n\n\nIf it fails to reach an amicable agreement with the Marcoses in the\nsharing of the Marcos loot, all the pending cases will then be transferred to\nthe custody of the Department of Justice for resolution. \n\n \n\nHe also reiterated that the Marcos family should appoint one\nrepresentative who will negotiate with the government for the settlement of\ntheir &dollar;580 million worth of assets. \n\n \n\n \" We are still confident that in the end, there\nwill be negotiations for a settlement.\n\n\nWhat is needed is for the Marcoses to appoint just one family\nrepresentative or negotiator so we could get down to business, &rdquo;\n he said. \n\n \n\nZamora said the PCGG is preparing for this eventuality.\n\n\nIn case nothing happens to the proposed settlement, they will go for\nthe forfeiture cases.  \n\n\n\n\n  2 troopers killed in ambush  \n\n\n Al Jacinto \n\n \n\nZAMBOANGA CITY.\n\n\n- - Suspected  Moro  Islamic Liberation Front rebels\nkilled two soldiers in an ambush Monday in Buldon town in Maguindanao as\ngovernment peace negotiators met with rebel leaders in the province, the army\nsaid. \n\n \n\nThe MILF denied any involvement in the attack and blamed a\n \" third group\"  out to sabotage peace talks between\ngovernment and the rebel group. \n\n \n\nNo major agreement was inked during the talks Monday held in\nDawa'h Center in  Sultan  Kudarat, Maguindanao.\n\n\nTalks continued Tuesday. \n\n \n\nThe slain soldiers were on board a jeep on their way back from\nthe market to their command post in  Barangay  Mercedes in\nBuldon at about 11:20 a.m. when a band of  Moro  rebels\nattacked them in the village of Cabayuan in Buldon. \n\n \n\nThe victims have been identified as Cpls.

( SPPC), said that there is an oversupply of base oil in the\nAsian region. \n\n \n\nDespite having stopped operations for two months from December to\nJanuary, Quiniones said there remains a supply glut. \n\n \n\nThere is a world supply glut and it is not helping that Singapore\nwith its more efficient and modern refineries is cutting prices. \n\n \n\n \" Total demand in the local and international\nmarkets are way, way down. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nQuiniones said total demand, in terms of volume, for lubricants,\none of the key by-products of base oil aside from asphalt, has dropped by 15\npercent last year from 1997. \n\n \n\nIn 1998, total demand for the refinery 's base oil was only at\n110,000 tons of barrel.\n\n\nThe maximum capacity of the plant is 170,000 tons. \n\n \n\nLast month, SPPC reported total base oil demand of only 10,000\ntons.\n\n\nQuiniones said the refinery can only accommodate a minimum demand of\n90,000 tons in a year. \n\n \n\n \" \" Shut down \" is a very bad\nword, but we may be forced to do it again if total demand continues to be low\nrelative to our supply.\n\n\nWe can only pray that things improve this year.\n\n\nThere 's always a chance to close, we hope the economy will rebound,\n&rdquo;  the SPPC official mused.\n\n\n \" We can't do anything about the excess capacity ( of\nbase oil).\n\n\nThey 're just wasted. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nSPPC is the only local supplier of base oil.\n\n\nAs such, it has an absolute monopoly of the total asphalt\nrequirements of the country, providing about 70 percent of the total. \n\n \n\nAmong its customers are the other large oil companies and some of\nthe leading construction firms in the country. \n\n \n\nHowever, if the persisting repressed demand forces SPPC to close\nshop, the country will need about &dollar;32 million to import its base\nrequirements.\n\n\nSPPC has provided the country about &dollar;17 million in earnings\nfrom its exportation of base oil products and by-products.  \n\n\n\n\n  PAL eyes tie-ups with other airlines  \n\n \n\nThe Philippine Airlines is eyeing joint-service tie-ups with\nAmerican and European airlines and sharing franchise with local airlines.\n\n\n \n\nPAL chief company adviser Peter Foster said yesterday these steps\nare part of the ongoing reforms in PAL and under its revised rehabilitation\nplan due for submission by mid-March. \n\n \n\nThe tie-ups and code sharing will improve PAL 's route structure,\ngeographical reach and product offerings, Foster said. \n\n \n\nPAL is currently talking to a number of US carriers about forging\njoint-service agreements on the important trans-Pacific routes. \n\n \n\nPAL is the only airline operating non-stop services between\nManila and the major US West Coast gateway of Los Angeles and San Francisco.\n\n\n \n\n \" A tie-up with a US carrier would enhance PAL 's\nposition in terms of feed from other points in the US, as well as\nfrequent-flyer benefits for US-originating passengers, &rdquo;  noted\nFoster. \n\n \n\nPAL has also opened discussions with a number of European\ncarriers regarding similar joint-service arrangements between Manila and\nEurope, which could involve the use of PAL aircraft, Foster added. \n\n \n\nIn the domestic scene, PAL is seriously considering the adoption\nof a franchise system with one or more local carriers in which the latter\nwould operate some of the minor routes not currently serviced by PAL. \n\n \n\nThe franchise scheme, which is similar to existing arrangements\namong European and US carriers, offers substantial benefits for all parties\nconcerned. \n\n \n\n \" The smaller carriers benefit from having their\nservices sold to a wider audience via the world-wide distribution and\nmarketing network of PAL.\n\n\nOn the other hand, PAL will have an expanded network of routes to\nsell, &rdquo;  explained Foster. \n\n \n\nIn the end, the riding public benefits from the arrangement by\ngaining more services to domestic destinations that would not otherwise be\nserved by local carriers, the PAL executive added.  \n\n\n\n\n  Creditors want new investors in Victorias  \n\n \n\nCreditors of Victorias Milling Co. are insisting that a new set\nof investors run the company. \n\n \n\nThe 32 creditor banks said that current shareholders should give\nup control as this is the only way to bring back Victorias to its feet. \n\n \n\nPhilippine Commercial International Bank executive vice-president\nand Victorias management committee chairman Isidro Alcantara said that the\nbanks wanted an auction for Victorias, otherwise they back off from the\nrehabilitation plan which includes the conversion of &peso;1.5 billion of the\nbank 's exposure in VMC into equity. \n\n \n\n \" The creditors have made it clear from the very\nstart that they will convert into equity if equity is auctioned off.\n\n\nThis is to maximize the inflows to the company and to make it more\ntransparent, &rdquo;  Alcantara said. \n\n \n\nHe noted that there is a move from VMC 's management to retain\ncontrol of the sugar mill through an exercise of pre-emptive rights in the\nbidding process. \n\n \n\nAlcantara said Victorias president Manuel Ma&ntilde;alac should\njoin the public bidding if he has enough funds to compete with the interested\ninvestors in VMC. \n\n \n\nIn an event that Ma&ntilde;alac managed to retain control of the\ncompany, the management committee chairman said the creditor banks will\nwithdraw from the &peso;2.2 billion rehabilitation plan.  \n\n\n\n\n  Give valor awardees full dues: Biazon  \n\n \n\nSen.

Santillan \n\n \n\nIt may have blinked in the &peso;25.27-billion tax evasion suit\nagainst Fortune Tobacco Corp., its officials and nine alleged dummy firms,\nbut the Bureau of Internal Revenue ( BIR) said it is bent on having the\nSupreme Court indict the cigarette manufacturer for failing to pay a\n&peso;30.9-million, four-year deficiency tax. \n\n \n\nIn a four-page motion obtained by  \" Business World\n\"  , BIR commissioner Beethoven Rualo last week asked the High\nTribunal for a 30-day extension to appeal an earlier dismissal by the Court\nof Appeals. \n\n \n\n \" ( I) am not in conformity with the ( Court of\nAppeals ' ) decision and resolution and intends to appeal therefrom, &rdquo;\n said Mr. Rualo, through the bureau 's litigation and prosecution\ndivision chief Osias Baldivino. \n\n \n\nThe case, which involves Fortune Tobacco 's alleged non-payment of\nexcise taxes on the importation of stemmed leaf tobacco for four years, was\ndismissed last January by the appellate court.\n\n\nLast month, the Internal Revenue 's motion for reconsideration was\nlikewise junked. \n\n \n\nCourt rules allow an aggrieved party to go to the High Court\nwithin 15 days from receipt of an unfavorable decision.\n\n\nBIR had until last Wednesday to file its petition for review. \n\n \n\nThe BIR 's persistence to pursue the tax deficiency suit covering\n1986 to 1990 was a far cry from its action on the nine counts of tax evasion\nit earlier slapped against Fortune Tobacco, its marketing companies, and 70\nexecutives, including beer and tobacco magnate Lucio Tan. \n\n \n\nIn a hearing last Friday, the BIR formally asked Marikina\nMetropolitan Trial Court judge Alex Ruiz to dismiss the \" most\ncontroversial case &rdquo; due to lack of evidence. \n\n \n\nMr. Ruiz chided the BIR for failing to confer with the Justice\ndepartment, which filed the criminal case, before submitting the motion.\n\n\nHe ordered the BIR and the DoJ prosecution panel, led by senior state\nprosecutor Paulita Villarante, to meet and decide whether or not the case\nshould be withdrawn. \n\n \n\nThe next hearing was set on Jan. 15. \n\n \n\nIf the Supreme Court decides in favor of the government in the\ncivil case set to be appealed, the BIR stands to collect a measly 1/100 of 1%\nof the amount it could add up to government coffers if it pursues the\n&peso;25.27-billion tax fraud case. \n\n \n\nMoreover, the case is civil in nature, thus, Fortune Tobacco\nofficials liable for the non-payment, will not serve any jail term. \n\n \n\nFormer Solicitor General Estelito Mendoza, Fortune Tobacco 's\ncounsel, refused to comment on the latest BIR move, saying he will wait for\nthe High Court 's order to comment on the case, if such will not be dismissed\noutright. \n\n \n\nIn its 24-page decision promulgated last January, the 17th\ndivision dismissed BIR 's petition seeking the payment of &peso;309 million\nin excise taxes on the firm 's imported leaf tobacco, ruling the BIR\neffectively usurped Congress ' law-making power in making the demand. \n\n \n\n \" Only Congress, not the BIR, can provide for\nadditional taxes ...\n\n\nIt is arrogating powers to itself which it does not possess, &rdquo;\n said associate justice Corona Ibay-Somera, who penned the decision.\n\n\nThe ruling was concurred by associate justices Oswaldo Agcaoili and\nRodrigo Cosico. \n\n \n\nThe BIR then asked the appellate court to uphold its power to\nlevy a &peso;0.75 per kilo of stemmed leaf, as provided in its Revenue\nRegulations No. 17-67.\n\n\nIt added stemmed leaf was reclassified by the BIR commissioner so it\ncan be subject to excise tax. \n\n \n\nFortune Tobacco said the product is already subject to specific\ntax under the Tax Code. \n\n \n\nIn ruling in favor of the cigarette manufacturer, the Court of\nAppeals said the BIR commissioner  \" has gone into unauthorized\namendment of the law &rdquo;  and not merely in interpretation. \n\n \n\nOn appeal, which was set aside on Nov. 13, the BIR insisted there\nis  \" no double taxation in the prohibited sense. &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\nThe BIR is expected to elevate the case to the Supreme Court by\nJan. 8. \n\n \n\nIn a related development, the DoJ prosecution panel handling the\n&peso;25.27-billion tax case said Mr. Ruiz, presiding judge of the Marikina\nMTC Branch 75, should not wait until next year to issue warrants of arrest\nagainst the 70 accused, including Mr. Tan. \n\n \n\nThe prosecution team asked Mr. Ruiz last Friday to \n\" immediately &rdquo;  issue arrest warrants against the nine\nFortune Tobacco officials and 61 executives of its nine marketing arms. \n\n \n\n \" The opposition ( of the accused) constitutes\nobstruction of justice since the only evident purpose thereof is to\ndeliberately delay the proceedings, &rdquo;  the DoJ said. \n\n \n\nMr. Mendoza asked the lower court last Dec. 3 not to issue any\nwarrant, considering the tax case  \" has no leg to stand on.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nHe said the BIR 's withdrawal from the case should be the basis\nfor its dismissal. \n\n \n\nThe DoJ said Mr. Mendoza 's opposition to the issuance of\nwarrants was highly improper.\n\n\nIt said Fortune Tobacco officials should have awaited the service of\nwarrants before filing an opposition. \n\n \n\nHowever, Mr. Ruiz effectively allowed all the accused to go\nscot-free, at least until Jan. 15. \n\n \n\nHe said much as he would like to grant both parties ' motion to\nresolve the issuance of the arrest warrants, the court has to suspend\nproceedings to give way to its yearly case inventory.  \n\n\n\n\n  C&P Homes eyes property swap to settle &peso;5-B debt\n \n\n\n Noel G. Reyes \n\n \n\nC&P Homes, Inc., the country 's leading developer of low-cost\nhousing founded and still majority-owned by House Speaker Manuel B. Villar,\nhas sent feelers to its creditors it wants to enter into a  \ndacion en pago   agreement covering around &peso;5 billion of\nits &peso;8.75 billion in short-term debt, industry sources said. \n\n \n\nBut most of the creditor banks of C&P Homes interviewed by\n\"  Business World  \" yesterday are against the\nhousing developer 's plan to place &peso;5 billion in short-term debts under\na   dacion en pago   deal. \n\n \n\nA top official of one of the banks, on condition of anonymity,\nsaid C&P Homes ' plan has been known to most banks as early as four to five\nmonths ago. \n\n \n\nHowever, he said the housing firm was insisting on covering all\nof its &peso;16-billion exposure at the time under the agreement. \n\n \n\nBanks opposed the proposal, not wanting the Villar-owned company\nto dictate the valuation of its assets that will cover the debts.\n\n\n \" There 's a big possibility that it will inflate its\nassets, &rdquo;  another top official of a creditor said. \n\n \n\nIn its current form, the proposed settlement will leave creditors\nholding another &peso;9.6 billion of the company 's long-term debt, including\n&dollar;150 million in floating rate notes ( FRNs), in a predicament,\nfinancial analysts said. \n\n \n\nUnder a   dacion en pago   deal, the\nlender and the borrower agree to settle a debt with assets, normally real\nestate and other properties.\n\n\nSuch payment in kind eliminates the need for costly foreclosure\nproceedings in court. \n\n \n\n\"  Business World  \" tried but could\nnot get a statement from C&P Homes whose officials were yesterday either\n \" out of the country,\"   \" unavailable\n&rdquo;  or  \" attending a meeting.\"  \n\n \n\n \" Bankers were panicky\"  upon learning of\nthe plan, said a local fund manager who last Wednesday attended a bondholders\nmeeting called by Far East Bank and Trust Co. ( FEBTC), which acts as trustee\nfor C&P Homes ' &peso;3-billion long-term commercial paper due in 2001 and\n2003. \n\n \n\n \" Far East Bank is resigned to the fact that ( C&P\nHomes) will soon not be able to service the interest payment on the debt\n&rdquo;  although it has so far been current on its debts service\npayments, said the fund manager.\n\n\nNeedless to say,  \" if they can't pay the interest, what\nmore the principal? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nUnfortunately for the creditors, added an equity analyst with a\nforeign brokerage house, just about all the company 's debts were granted on\na \" clean loan &rdquo; basis, or without any collateral. \n\n \n\n \" This was the time when Manny Villar and C&P still\nhad sweet-smelling names and everybody was falling over themselves trying to\nlend to them, &rdquo;  the analyst said. \n\n \n\nThose days are now long gone.\n\n\nFor the first nine months of the year, C&P Homes reported a 77%\ndecline in net income to &peso;251 million, earning a measly &peso;37 million\non sales of &peso;786 million in the third quarter alone. \n\n \n\nMore worrisome, its cash levels as of end of the third quarter,\naccording to the company 's financial statement, plunged 87% to &peso;436\nmillion after it recorded an operational cash outflow of &peso;2.9 billion in\nthe period. \n\n \n\nWhen compared with its annual interest expense of between\n&peso;2.0 billion and &peso;2.5 billion, its remaining cash hoard becomes\nwholly inadequate, analysts say. \n\n \n\nDeterioration in its business operations may also be seen in the\n17% expansion of its receivables to almost &peso;15 billion despite a 52%\ndrop in revenues to &peso;22 billion in the January-September period. \n\n\n  PROBLEMATIC  \n\n \n\nThe huge receivables account, equivalent to almost 43% of total\nassets, has become problematic not only for the company and its creditors,\nbut also to its external auditor, SyCip, Gorres & Velayo & Co. ( SGV). \n\n \n\nThe auditors noted that prior to June 1996, the company 's\noperating subsidiaries used to deal with the National Home Mortgage Finance\nCorp. ( NHMFC), wherein the latter would purchase the subsidiaries ' housing\nloans and contracts receivables as provided for under the government 's\nUnified Home Lending Program. \n\n \n\nHowever, when the program was taken over by the Home Development\nMutual Fund (  PAG-IBIG  ) in 1996, it strictly imposed the\nhousing loan agreements.\n\n\nIn particular, it required a redocumentation process that included\ncertificates of loan eligibility, loan counselling for the lot buyers, and\ncollateral appraisal reports all of which prolonged the mortgage take-out\nperiod from an average of six months to about 12 to 15 months. \n\n \n\nLast Feb. 20, 1998, the  PAG-IBIG  Fund issued\nCircular No. 159 which, among others, required that the loan account applied\nby companies such as C&P Homes have collection efficiency ( CE) of at least\n80%  \" and to increase gradually to the desired rate of 97%\nwhenever appropriate. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nShould the CE fall below the minimum,  PAG-IBIG \nwill suspend processing or withhold payment of the takeout proceeds of\ndevelopers such as C&P Homes. \n\n \n\n \" The failure of the subsidiaries to meet the CE\nlevels set by (  PAG-IBIG  ) will significantly affect the\ncollectibility of the subsidiaries ' contracts receivable balance, &rdquo;\n wrote the auditors in C&P Homes ' notes to financial statements.\n\n\n \n\n \" The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot\npresently be determined since (  PAG-IBIG  ) Circular No. 159\n&rdquo;  took effect in 1998.\n\n\nIt added:  \" The related effects of these guidelines\nwill be reported in the financial statements as they become known and\nestimable. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nMeanwhile, C&P Homes ' bondholders are preparing to recover as\nmuch of their principal as they can.\n\n\n \" We 're kind of nervous and we intend to put a lien on\nthe company 's assets, &rdquo;  said the fund manager.\n\n\nHowever, the company has refused to give the bondholders ' group a\nlist of its properties. \n\n \n\nThe bondholders claim that a   dacion en pago \n on a portion of the company 's short-term debts would violate a\n\" negative pledge &rdquo; embodied in the customary  \"\npari passu &rdquo;  clause in their loan agreement.\n\n\nBasically, this clause ensures that the company will treat all\ncreditors equally.\n\n\nIn this case, if it enters into a   dacion en pago \n with one class of creditor, it may have to do the same with the\nrest.\n\n\nEven holders of the &dollar;150-million FRN due 2003, issued last\nyear by a Cayman Island-registered wholly owned subsidiary of C&P Homes, has\nthis clause. \n\n \n\nWith only &peso;13.3 billion worth of real estate in its books,\nthere obviously won't be enough to pay off the company 's &peso;18-billion\ndebt.\n\n\nIt becomes even less when one considers that short-term creditors\nwant the properties to be swapped to be valued as \" raw land &rdquo;\nand not as developed land. \n\n \n\nC&P Homes ' creditors list contains the who 's who in Philippine\nbanking, industry sources said.\n\n\nThose identified with huge exposures are PCI Bank, Philippine\nNational Bank, Bank of the Philippine Islands ( BPI), Metropolitan Bank &\nTrust Co., Union Bank of the Philippines, and the Rizal Commercial Banking\nCorp.\n\n\nThey said BPI and PCI Bank 's exposures were bigger, having been the\nfirm 's lead underwriters for its initial public offering about three years\nago. \n\n \n\nA source from a local bank said C&P Homes may have resorted to\nthe   dacion en pago   after its earlier plan to\nseek a debt moratorium from the Securities and Exchange Commission was not\nsupported by its external auditor.\n\n\nThe company may have to sell some of its land bank to partially pay\noff its debts.\n\n\nC&P currently has a land bank totalling 3,000 hectares. \n\n \n\nHowever, even if the company disposes its properties, there may\nbe no buyer given the prevailing glut in the real estate industry and the\ncondition of some of the company 's lands. \n\n \n\nAnalysts said the quality of C&P 's land bank will pose a problem\nsince several parcels are untitled while some are occupied by squatter\ncommunities. \n\n \n\nThis was one reason property developer Ayala Land, Inc. suspended\nits planned acquisition of the company recently, another source said. \n\n \n\nThis was on top of its uncollected receivables which amounted to\nsome &peso;12 billion.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c8d7a64b-781a-4017-8dd4-c156a32e3ae4", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.281958+00:00"}
{"text": "Foreign debt piles up as RP rebuilds economy  \n\n\n Ma. Salve I. Duplito \n\n \n\nFinally, experts see the Philippines heading towards recovery\nafter more than a year of suffering from the effects of the Asian financial\ncrisis, but Filipinos will find rebuilding the economy can be very expensive.\n\n\n \n\nLatest official government figures show future generations of\ntaxpayers will have to contend with paying for additional foreign loans.\n\n\nNext year, &dollar;8.39 billion will be borrowed by the government and\nthe private sector to make the recovery process as short as possible. \n\n \n\n Bangko Sentral  figures show this will bring the\ncountry 's outstanding external debt - - both public and private - - to\n&dollar;53.2 billion, from &dollar;44.81 billion before the start of the\ncurrency turmoil in July last year, or an 18.72% expansion. \n\n \n\nAdditional loans have been negotiated since early this year\nbetween the government and such multilateral financing institutions as the\nWorld Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Asian Development Bank, the\nJapan Export Import Bank and the Japanese government. \n\n \n\nThese loans - - to be released in several  tranches\n in the next two years - - will help the Estrada administration\nheal the economy by financing much-needed reforms, the government says. \n\n \n\nThe World Bank loan, for example, was designed to finance reforms\nin the banking sector especially in the area of bank supervision and\nexamination, where most of the attention since the onset of the crisis has\nbeen focused on. \n\n \n\nThe ADB gave priority to reforms in the social sector and has\nextended two loans in the air and energy sectors, stressing that the Asian\nfinancial crisis has developed into a human crisis of great proportions. \n\n \n\nThe IMF, through a standby facility activated by the government\nearly this year, will provide the balance-of-payments support the \nBangko Sentral  needs both to ensure the country 's credit worthiness\nand as protection against currency speculators. \n\n \n\nThe government also said it is hoping to acquire &dollar;250\nmillion in financial assistance from the Japanese government through the\n\" Miyazawa Initiative \" , a facility for Asian countries\npledged during the IMF-World Bank annual meeting a few months ago. \n\n \n\nThe IMF, the country 's tutor for two more years, the government\nsays, has allowed the government to bear the burden of revitalizing the\neconomy - - more borrowings and budget deficits - - to keep the economy\nalive. \n\n \n\nLoans from the private sector are expected to be few since\nbusiness confidence has yet to resume. \n\n \n\nWarnings have been aired that the government should decide\ncarefully which loans to incur so as not to make the Philippines vulnerable\nto another debt overhang at the end of the recovery period. \n\n \n\nIt was pointed out that loans, even from cheaper sources like the\nWorld Bank, the ADB and the IMF are still loans that have to be paid within a\nfew years down the road. \n\n \n\nFormer National Economic and Development Authority ( NEDA) deputy\ndirector-general Dante B. Canlas said earlier that if deficits must be\nincurred and foreign financing tapped, the government should carefully study\nwhich ones will be accepted, and how much.\n\n\nHe urged the government to keep its budget deficit as temporary as\npossible. \n\n \n\nAt &dollar;53.2 billion, the country 's outstanding external debt\nwill be 66.8% of its gross national product, 94.5% of receipts from exports\nof goods and services, official figures show. \n\n \n\nFor 1999 alone, the Philippines will have to cough up &dollar;5.9\nbillion for debt service on these obligations, preliminary figures from the\n Bangko Sentral  show.\n\n\nInterest payments alone will reach &dollar;3 billion.  \n\n\n\n\n  Congress panels start 1999 budget deliberations; 'pork'\nstill an issue  \n\n\n Yasmin Lee G. Arpon \n\n \n\nThe Senate and House of Representatives panels are set to meet\ntomorrow to begin bicameral discussions on the National Government 's 1999\nbudget.\n\n\nCongress is hard-pressed to ratify next year 's budget before going\non its month-long Christmas break starting Dec. 23. \n\n \n\nA contentious issue that may stall the discussions is the\ndivergent views of senators and congressmen on Congress ' role in the budget\nprocess. \n\n \n\nThe Senate panel members are Senators John Osme&ntilde;a,\nFranklin Drilon, Juan Ponce Enrile and Teofisto Guingona. \n\n \n\nThe House, on the other hand, is still yet to appoint its panel\ntoday, but three are already certain to be a part of the panel: House\ncommittee on appropriations chairman Gilberto Duavit of Rizal, committee\nsenior vice-chairman Leandro Verceles, Jr. of Catanduanes and House Minority\nLeader Feliciano Belmonte, Jr. of Quezon City. \n\n \n\nThe Senate approved a &peso;585-billion 1999 budget, including\nunprogrammed funds and debt service.\n\n\nThe amount is &peso;3 billion less than what was earlier approved by\nthe House. \n\n \n\nThe House generally favors the increase made by the Senate on the\nvarious departments ' budgets such as the Department of Public Works and\nHighways ' which was increased to &peso;41.5 billion from &peso;37.8 billion.\n\n\n \n\nBut congressmen are not too happy with the removal by senators of\na provision that would give them the leeway to identify projects in their\nrespective districts. \n\n \n\nMr. Osme&ntilde;a, chairman of the Senate committee on finance,\nearlier said Congress ' participation in the budget process stops with the\napproval of the General Appropriations Act ( GAA). \n\n \n\nBut congressmen want to assert their oversight function since\nthis is the only way they can claim participation in the budget process,\nespecially after President Estrada scrapped the countrywide development funds\nand public works funds. \n\n \n\nUnder House Bill No. 4240, congressional consultation and\napproval are required in the implementation of projects, facilities, programs\nand services under the GAA. \n\n \n\n\n\" The President has already agreed to that as a way of\naccommodating the congressmen.\n\n\nMaybe that is only public posturing ( on the Senate 's part), &rdquo;\n Batanes Rep. Florencio Abad, vice-chairman of the appropriations\nbody, said in an interview yesterday. \n\n \n\nHe noted that, for one, it has been the practice for congressmen\nto coordinate with the DPWH in identifying district projects and that \n\" DPWH does not seem to mind this. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nMr. Abad also described the differences between the Senate and\nthe House as an  \" institutional competition that only exists\nbefore the public eye. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nLeyte Rep. Sergio Apostol, House senior deputy minority leader,\nconcurred saying the senators are likely to agree to retain the contentious\nprovision.\n\n\n  \" Kuwento lang 'yan, &rdquo;    Mr. Apostol said.\n\n\n \" Tell me, who will identify the projects?\n\n\nThe Congressmen are the ones conversant as to what are needed by\ntheir respective districts. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nCongressmen are confident of eventually convincing Mr.\nOsme&ntilde;a to give them leeway to identify projects  \" since\nhe is a former congressman himself. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nMeanwhile, the House did not pose any initial opposition to the\nSenate 's proposal to cut the debt service by &peso;4 billion or to\n&peso;116.7 billion from &peso;120.7 billion.\n\n\nThe House did not touch the debt service allocation although it has\nbeen Congress ' common practice to cut this and realign the funds to the\nlegislators ' pet projects. \n\n \n\nIn previous years, the President would veto the cuts but not the\nrealignments made, bloating the national budget. \n\n \n\n \" The chairman ( Mr. Duavit) and even the President\nhas been quite emphatic not to return to that old practice so to the extent\npossible, we have avoided that, &rdquo;  Mr. Abad said. \n\n \n\n\n\" But there is already a leeway because of the reduction in the\ninterest rates.\n\n\nBecause of the lack of funds, the tendency is really to look for it\nin areas where cuts could be made and given the change in the economic\nconditions, we agree to that, &rdquo;  he added. \n\n \n\nThe Senate decided to cut the debt service, noting that the\ninterest rate has since gone down to 13.5% from Malaca&ntilde;ang 's\nassumption of 16.5%.\n\n\nAlso, the foreign exchange rate assumption was cut to &peso;40 from\n&peso;43: &dollar;1. \n\n \n\nBut Mr. Abad noted that cutting the debt service will violate the\nConstitution since debt service is considered an automatic appropriations and\nis already provided by law.  \n\n\n\n\n  Prudential,  Pilipinas  Bank stockholders\napprove merger  \n\n\n Reena J. Villamor \n\n \n\nThe stockholders of publicly listed Prudential Bank and its\ncommercial bank affiliate  Pilipinas  Bank have approved the\nmerger of the two banks, with Prudential Bank the surviving institution, a\ndisclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange ( PSE) said. \n\n \n\nBoth banks have already sought the  Bangko Sentral\n 's approval, which is expected before the year ends, \nPilipinas  bank executive vice-president and chief operating officer\nSantiago S. Syjuco III said. \n\n \n\nThe Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi ( BTM), which has a 10% stake in\nPrudential Bank and 30% in  Pilipinas  Bank, has confirmed the\nmerger, he said. \n\n \n\n \" This strategically sets up the new bank to\nvigorously pursue its expansion plans, continue to attract high-quality\nprofessionals and remain a competitive force in the local banking industry . ..\n\n\nThe two banks ' merger will result in a bank with a high capital base\nand a merger market share, &rdquo;  he said. \n\n \n\nThe new bank 's capital is estimated to come close to &peso;8\nbillion, which will far exceed the mandated minimum &peso;5.4-billion capital\nfor universal banks by the end of 2000, Mr. Syjuco told \" \nBusiness World  \" . \n\n \n\nCombined resources would total to about &peso;40 billion and\ndeposits in the region of &peso;31 billion, he added.\n\n\nThe bank will also have a network of 189 branches---69 from \nPilipinas  Bank and 120 from the universal bank. \n\n \n\nPrudential Bank is majority-owned by the Santos family.\n\n\nIt was established in 1952 and has close to &peso;4 billion in\ncapital.\n\n\n Pilipinas  Bank, meanwhile, is 60% owned by\nPrudential Bank.\n\n\nIt was established in 1957 and has a capital of &peso;1.742 billion.\n\n\n \n\n \" Its common set of majority stockholders were the\nkey to the decision.\n\n\nThe Santos family and the BTM are the largest stockholders, &rdquo;\n Mr. Syjuco said. \n\n \n\nWith the merger, he said the Santos family is expected to\nmaintain majority ownership at a  \" rough estimate\"  of\n \" less than 60%\"  while BTM will maintain a \n\" less than 20%\"  ownership.\n\n\nBusiness partners of the bank, he said, will hold the remainder. \n\n\n  FORMAL PROCESS  \n\n \n\nMr. Syjuco said the completion of the consolidation is targetted\non Aug. 9, 1999, the birth anniversary of Prudential Bank 's founder, Don\nRoman R. Santos.\n\n\nThe formal process starts this January. \n\n \n\nThe name and logo of the new bank will still be determined and\nits officers will likewise be decided by the new board of directors next\nyear, he said. \n\n \n\n \" The complementary character of both banks assures\nthe success of the merger.\n\n\nPrudential Bank is widely known for its conservative, largely secured\nlending to small- and medium-sized borrowers while  Pilipinas \nBank, known for cautious aggressiveness, has built a solid reputation and a\nmajor market share among Japanese multinationals doing business in the\ncountry, &rdquo;  Mr. Syjuco said. \n\n \n\n \" The merger will position the new bank ... to\nbetter service the needs of BTM 's retail clients and improve its market\nshare versus other Japanese-Filipino banks operating in the Philippines.\n\n\nAlthough the volume of Japanese business has dropped by 50% in 1998\ndue to the regional economic crisis, it can be noted that our banks '\nestimated market share of Japanese business in the Philippines has increased\nto 50% from only 30% in 1993, &rdquo;  he told \" \nBusiness World  \" . \n\n \n\nMr. Syjuco stressed, however, BTM, which set up a foreign branch\nin the country in 1995, will maintain its local presence as a full-service\nbranch which concentrates on wholesale banking. \n\n \n\nHe added the merger will not result in retrenchment.\n\n\n Pilipinas  Bank has 1,100 employees while Prudential\nhas 1,600. \n\n \n\n \" The unibank grew in structure in the past five\nyears.\n\n\nThe merged bank will make use of  Pilipinas  Bank 's\norganization, which includes its officers and employees, &rdquo;  he\nsaid. \n\n \n\n Pilipinas  Bank has recently concluded its\ncollective bargaining agreement with its employees. \n\n \n\nMeanwhile, in yesterday 's trade, Prudential Bank 's shares\nremained unchanged at &peso;600 per share.  \n\n\n\n\n  Gov't lawyers go after properties of Marcos family \n\n\n\n Cecille M. Santillan \n\n \n\nThe Bureau of Internal Revenue ( BIR) asked yesterday the Supreme\nCourt to uphold the confiscation of 30 parcels of land owned by the heirs of\nformer President Ferdinand Marcos. \n\n \n\nThe land parcels were taken as partial payment for &peso;23.5\nbillion in unpaid estate and income taxes for the year 1982 to 1986. \n\n \n\nIn an 18-page comment, the BIR asked the Court to junk the\nMarcoses ' second appeal of the confiscation, saying it is already \n\" obstructive of the orderly administration of justice. &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\nBIR also said the second appeal did not present any \n\" persuasive reason &rdquo;  to overturn the Court 's earlier\nruling. \n\n \n\n \" Considering the obvious lack of merit...it is but\nproper for the Court to now write  finis  to this case. ...\n\"  it added. \n\n \n\nIn June 1997, the Court approved the sale of the land parcels to\nsatisfy the family 's tax debt. \n\n \n\nIt affirmed the Court of Appeals ' ruling upholding the validity\nof 30 notices of levy against the properties.\n\n\nIt said the government may seize the assets as a summary tax remedy\nwithout the approval of a settlement court. \n\n \n\nThe ruling has twice been appealed by the President 's son,\nFerdinand \" Bongbong &rdquo; Marcos II, who sought the nullification of\nthe notices. \n\n \n\nIn 1991, BIR ruled the Marcoses failed to pay a total of\n&peso;23.2 billion covering deficiency estate taxes for four years and\ndeficiency income taxes for 1982 to 1986. \n\n \n\nBIR said it was constrained to go after the properties because\nthe Marcoses  \" deliberately ignored &rdquo;  the\ndeficiency tax assessment personally served on Mr. Marcos and his mother,\nImelda. \n\n \n\nBIR issued 30 notices of levy on real property owned by the\nMarcoses, most of which are in Leyte, to satisfy the tax debt.\n\n\nThe land parcels were forfeited in favor of the government.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "b43a2976-0492-467a-84b9-926265d6597b", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.283169+00:00"}

Than Shwe of Myanmar, Prime\nMinister Goh Chok Tong of Singapore, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai of Thailand\nand Prime Minister Phan Van Khai of Vietnam. \n\n \n\nAfter the two-day summit, Estrada and the First Lady will start a\nstate visit to Vietnam Thursday and Friday as guests of President Tran Duc\nLuong. \n\n \n\nThe Philippine President will also pay courtesy calls on General\nSecretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, Le Kha Phieu, and National\nAssembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh. \n\n \n\nIn talks with President Luong, both sides are expected to discuss\nmeasures to further strengthen the friendship and comprehensive cooperation\nbetween the Philippines and Vietnam, as well as international and regional\nissues of mutual concern. \n\n \n\nPresident Estrada 's visit will also be marked by the signing of\nan agreement on crime control and another on visa exemption for diplomatic\nservice passport holders and faster visa processing for ordinary passport\nholders.  \n\n\n\n\n  Total log ban vowed this year  \n\n \n\nThe government will pursue a total log ban and padlock more\npolluting factories this year as it steps up its campaign to check the\n \" wanton degradation of our natural resources &rdquo; \nand save the environment for future generations, Malaca&ntilde;ang said\nyesterday. \n\n \n\nReporting on its environment-friendly plans for 1999 and beyond,\nMalaca&ntilde;ang said it will strengthen the implementation of its\ncommunity-based forest management programs, improve the country 's capacity\nfor sustainable development of its coastal and marine resources, and\nintensify monitoring activities to ensure enforcement of environmental laws\n \" without regard to stature or political connections of\nviolators. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThe Presidential Management Staff ( PMS), in a recent technical\nreport, said the national government will revitalize forest-based industries,\nenhance private sector investments in the forestry sector, simplify the\nEnvironment Impact Assessment System ( EIAS), and heighten efforts to improve\nthe quality of air in Metro Manila and other urban centers. \n\n \n\n \" We will pursue a total log ban to protect our\nforests ... and sustain our efforts to close down factories that destroy our\nenvironment, &rdquo;  the PMS said in the report. \n\n \n\nIt added that the Estrada administration will strive this year to\n \" develop close collaboration and partnership with the private\nsector, non-government organizations ( NGOs), and local government units (\nLGUs) to promote sustainable development. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nIn pursuit of President Estrada 's commitment to sustainable\ndevelopment, the PMS report said that Malaca&ntilde;ang, the Department of\nEnvironment and Natural Resources ( DENR), and other government agencies\nheld-over 30 major projects in 1998 in the fields of forest and marine\nconservation, air and water pollution control, solid waste management,\nregulation of mineral resource exploration, and preservation of biological\ndiversity. \n\n \n\nLast year, the Estrada administration  \" ensured\nthat the pursuit of economic growth and development would not entail the\nwanton degradation of our natural resources, &rdquo;  the PMS report\nsaid. \n\n \n\n \" In line with this, we focused our efforts to\npromote sustainable development, conservation of our marine and coastal\nresources, preservation of biological diversity, strengthening of wildlife\nconservation projects, preservation of forest resources, rehabilitation of\nwatershed, implementation of land management projects, and regulation of the\nexploration of mineral resources, &rdquo;  it added. \n\n \n\nAccording to the report, the DENR reduced the number of illegal\nlogging \" hot spots &rdquo; from 212 last July to 46 last November,\nconfiscated \" hot logs &rdquo; worth &peso;54 million, planted a total\nforest area of 18,523 hectares from July to October last year, and mobilized\n296 multisectoral forest protection committees nationwide to assist the\ngovernment in its war against illegal loggers. \n\n \n\nTo revive the dying wood industry, the Estrada administration\nidentified 200,000 hectares of private land in North east Mindanao 's viable\ntree farm centers and another 700,000 hectares in the same areas as a premier\n\" timber corridor, &rdquo; the PMS report said. \n\n \n\nAlso last year, the DENR closed down five firms - - Marigold\nCommodities, Dyzum Distillery, Absolut Chemical, Consolidated Distillery and\nBinalbagan-Isabela Sugar Co. - - for dumping untreated effluents or wastes in\ncritical waterways, seized 606 highly-endangered animals, canceled or\nsuspended quarrying permits in Rizal and Pampanga, and asked the Office of\nthe Solicitor General ( OSG) to cancel 100 fraudulent land titles. \n\n \n\n \" All these highlight our political will to protect\nour environment and ensure the proper use and conservation of our natural\nresources, &rdquo;  the PMS report said. \n\n \n\nTo counteract the worsening air pollution in the Metropolis, the\nPMS said President Estrada created last year, the Presidential Air Quality\nCommission to oversee the phaseout of leaded gasoline, as well as the Task\nForce on Air Quality, which conducted free tests on diesel engine vehicles\nfor government agencies and bus companies. \n\n \n\nIn water pollution control, the government launched programs to\nrehabilitate the Pasig River and Laguna Lake, intensified the monitoring\nactivities of 511 water-sampling stations nationwide, and expanded the\ncoverage of the Environmental User Fee System, which requires industries that\ndischarge wastewater to help shoulder the cost of rehabilitating the bay.\n\n\n \n\nThe PMS said that last year, the DENR forged with the Department\nof Tourism an agreement prescribing the guidelines of eco-tourism\ndevelopment, formulated a \" Green Globe &rdquo; destination program for\nCamiguin Islands, implemented a national biodiversity strategy and action\nplan, proclaimed almost 90,000 hectares in the  El Nido \nMarine Reserve in Palawan as a protected area, and established the\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN) Regional Center for\nBiodiversity Conservation in  Los Ba&ntilde;os  , Laguna.\n\n\n \n\nTo better protect Philippine wildlife, the DENR also initiated\nthe marine turtle satellite tracking system on Baguan Island, conducted the\nfirst national   dugong   ( sea cow) seminar-workshop\nin Davao, formulated the guidelines for the pilot rearing of saltwater\ncrocodiles, continued field surveys for possible sightings and nest locations\nof the endangered Philippine eagle. \n\n \n\nA total of 606 highly-endangered animals smuggled or sold in pet\nshops were confiscated last year.\n\n\nThey included box turtles, Palawan talking mynahs, racket-tailed\nparrots, mouse deer, monitor lizards, sailfin lizards, blue-naped parrots,\nand green iguanas. \n\n \n\nOn watershed protection, the government implemented last year the\nwater resource development project, and established 975,017 square meters and\n2,894 cubic meters for vegetative and engineering structures, respectively,\nto prevent soil erosion and stabilize land contours.  \n\n\n\n\n  Baguio flower fest set Feb. 20  \n\n \n\nFirst Lady Luisa Estrada and Tourism Secretary Gemma Cruz Araneta\nwill be the special guests at the opening of Baguio 's fourth flower festival\n\"  Panagbenga  ' 99 &rdquo;

Crismundo \n\n \n\nBUTUAN CITY - -\n\n\nThree persons were reported killed and at least 3,500 families were\ndisplaced as \" flash floods &rdquo; submerged several towns in Agusan\ndel Sur for the past 18 days. \n\n \n\nReports reaching this city identified the fatalities as Ramil\nApalla, 26, of Bah-Bah Village, and Fel Ajita, 25, of  barangay\n San Roque, both of  Prosperidad  town, and\nRonillo Mabandos, 19, of New Gingoong, Sibagat town. \n\n \n\nJosefina Bajade, provincial welfare officer, reported to Gov.\nValentina G. Plaza that Apalla was swept away by rampaging water while\nattempting to cross the Gibong river, while Ajita drowned as the water\noverflowed. \n\n \n\nMabandos, reportedly an NPA rebel, also drowned while crossing\nthe Andana river. \n\n \n\nThe Provincial Disaster Coordinating Council ( PDCC) said that\nthe towns of San Francisco, Esperanza and Trento have encountered heavy\nflooding due to continuous heavy downpour and strong winds. \n\n \n\nThe PDCC said that at least 75  barangays  in 14\ntowns of the province are under water, prompting the provincial legislative\nboard to declare the province under a state of calamity. \n\n \n\nHowever, the PDCC has yet to assess the extent of damage to\nagricultural crops and infrastructure projects. \n\n \n\nThe governor has created a special task force for relief and\nrescue operations. \n\n \n\nField reports said the PDCC has started distributing relief goods\nto flood victims who are reportedly temporarily sheltered at various\nevacuation centers in the province. \n\n \n\nVarious socio-civic organizations also sent ready-to-eat foods\nand used clothings to the victims. \n\n \n\nMeanwhile, Chief Supt. Fritz D. Quinanola, Police Regional Office\n13 ( PRO 13) regional director and chairperson of the Caraga Regional\nDisaster Coordinating Council ( RDCC), yesterday ordered Supt.

{"text": "DENR stops logging and mining in Caraga  \n\n\n Dona Policar \n\n \n\nTHE Department of Environment and Natural Resources ( DENR)\nyesterday declared Caraga a calamity area, suspending all the permits and\nlicenses for forestry and mining activities in the region. \n\n \n\nThis developed as an aerial survey of the area showed thousands of\nlogs swept down into the Agusan river, bolstering an earlier assessment by\nofficials that the killer floods were a result of a decade of unabated\nlogging activities. \n\n \n\nContinuous heavy rains in Caraga the past two weeks caused flash\nfloods and landslides that have so far killed 23 persons, injured 16 others,\nand forced the evacuation of 10,502 families. \n\n \n\nThe National Disaster Coordinating Council ( NDCC) on Monday\nestimated the damages to crops and infrastructure at &peso;229.3 million.\n\n\nCaraga--which consists of Agusan del Sur, Agusan del Norte, Surigao\ndel Sur, and Surigao del Norte--is a rice- and corn-growing region. \n\n\n  Late solutions  \n\n \n\nIn Butuan, the region 's largest city, crop and infrastructure\ndamages amounted to about &peso;128 million, according to Mayor Democrito\nPlaza II. \n\n \n\nPresident Estrada on Monday declared a state of calamity in the\nfour Caraga provinces. \n\n \n\nAs in the past, local officials are cramming for a solution after\nthe disaster has struck.\n\n\nAgusan del Norte Rep. Leovigildo Banag said the government was now\nmapping out a master plan to restore the forest cover in Caraga. \n\n \n\nEnvironment Secretary Antonio Cerilles said the forestry and\nmining permits and licenses were ordered suspended until the damages and\nhazards caused by the floods shall have been assessed. \n\n\n  Seven days  \n\n \n\nCerilles dispatched the agency 's  La Ni&ntilde;a\n Damage Assessment Team to fast track disaster mitigation and\nrehabilitation measures in flooded areas. \n\n \n\nThe team--composed of Rolando Pe&ntilde;a from the Office of the\nSecretary and Sevillo David Jr. and Romeo Almeda from the Mines and\nGeo-Sciences Bureau--was given seven days to complete its damage assessment\nreport on the Agusan River basin. \n\n \n\nThe report would be used to determine if the next cycle of rains\ncould trigger another massive flooding, Cerilles said. \n\n \n\nIn recent weeks, some local officials said, landslides have\naccompanied the heavy rains.\n\n\nSeveral bridges had also been submerged and some small towns remained\ncut off from the city. \n\n \n\nChair Mar Candino of  Barangay  Bancasi outside\nButuan City recalled that in the early 1980s, the region still had lush\nforest cover; now, the hillsides are barren. \n\n \n\n  \" Kasi putol sila nang putol.\n\n\nNgayon ang mga bundok kalbong-kalbo na, &rdquo;   he\nsaid.\n\n\n [ Blame it on the loggers, they cut trees indiscriminately.\n\n\nNow the mountains are denuded.]  \n\n \n\nButuan City Mayor Plaza said floods periodically hit the area and\n \" we cannot attribute ( the floods) to that practice ( illegal\nlogging) completely. &rdquo;  \n\n  \" On Feb. 5, water started rising after dark after many\ndays of continuous rain, &rdquo;  Plaza told Reuters.\n\n\n \" All 86 ( villages) in Butuan were affected.\n\n\nIn 16 ( villages), we couldn't see land, only rooftops. &rdquo;\n \n\n\n  Erap may visit  \n\n \n\nAt the worst point of the deluge, the waters reached 25 feet\nhigh, he said.\n\n\nAlberto Bulabog, a farmer who lives some 100 meters away from Agusan\nRiver, said he had  \" no choice but to evacuate my family\n&rdquo;  when he saw the water rising at 1 a.m Friday. \n\n \n\nNow staying in an evacuation center at the Bancasi Elementary\nSchool, Bulabog said in Filipino,  \" Since then, I 've been\nvisiting my house and I 'm glad it 's still there. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nPresident Estrada said he might visit the flooded region when he\ngoes to Mindanao next week.\n\n\nHe expressed willingness to release additional funds for relief works\nin Caraga. \n\n\n  Help for farmers  \n\n \n\nDefense Secretary Orlando Mercado, who also chairs the NDCC, was\nin Caraga yesterday to assess the destruction and to bring food supplies and\na medical team. \n\n \n\nAgriculture Secretary William Dar told local officials in a\nbriefing that 2,000 sacks of  palay  seeds worth &peso;1.2\nmillion would be flown in anytime this week.\n\n\nHe also committed 52 sacks of vegetable seeds worth &peso;2 million,\nanimal dispersals worth &peso;5 million, and farming equipment worth\n&peso;8.8 million. \n\n \n\nThe Philippine National Police chief, Deputy Director General\nLastimoso, ordered the regional police in Caraga to assist not just in\nevacuating families affected by the floods but in the distribution of food\nand medical supplies as well. \n\n \n\nLastimoso was a battalion commander of the defunct Philippine\nConstabulary in Agusan and a PC provincial commander in Surigao del Sur in\nthe 1970s and early 1980s.  \n\n\n\n\n  Limits eyed on foreign retailers  \n\n\n Marvin Sy \n\n \n\nOFFICIALS from the National Economic and Development Authority (\nNeda) yesterday said they have already drafted a set of guidelines on how\nforeign companies may engage in retail trade in the country. \n\n \n\nThis developed as a senior legislator yesterday said the House of\nRepresentatives would ask the Supreme Court to rule on the constitutionality\nof the proposed retail trade liberalization law. \n\n \n\nThe set of proposed guidelines would be forwarded to both\nchambers of Congress for deliberation, said Neda officer-in-charge Raphael\nLotilla. \n\n \n\nIn an interview yesterday, Lotilla said the proposals cover the\nscope of activities that the foreign entrants may engage in. \n\n \n\nThese include the establishment of department store chains\nsimilar to those of Shoemart and Rustan 's or specialty stores that offer\nvery specific types of merchandise. \n\n \n\nGeographical limitations were also proposed by the NEDA with a\nslant toward highly urbanized areas.\n\n\nLotilla explained that the geo-physical limits are meant to protect\nsmall retailers in the provinces that have a relatively small market. \n\n\n  Limitations  \n\n \n\nAside from the geographical limitations, the number and size of\nthe establishments to be constructed would also be limited. \n\n \n\nAll the limitations mentioned are aimed at calming the \n\" basically unfounded\"  fears of \"  sari-sari\n store &rdquo; operators. \n\n \n\nBut the more cautious members of the House committee in trade and\nindustry want to consult the Supreme Court first to avoid making the same\nmistakes when the oil deregulation bill was made into law. \n\n \n\nThis was expressed by Quezon Rep. Marcial Punzalan ( Lamp) who\nchairs the House committee on trade and industry.\n\n\nHe said his panel would meet again to discuss technical and legal\naspects of the proposed bill. \n\n\n  Local concerns  \n\n \n\nBut another lawmaker, Negros Oriental Rep. Herminio Teves,\nclaimed the high court would not entertain the committee 's inquiry because\nthe tribunal only decides on existing laws and cases. \n\n \n\n \" When the bill is passed, then they can bring it\nto the courts, &rdquo;  Teves said. \n\n \n\nBoth lawmakers also allayed fears that the liberalization of\nretail trade would result in foreign domination of that sector. \n\n \n\nConcern had been raised by retail groups on the impact of\nliberalization on the small and medium-sized retailers.\n\n\nThey claimed that the entry of foreign companies would \" kill\n&rdquo; local retailers because of the lower prices that foreigner is\nexpected to offer. \n\n \n\nLotilla, however, explained that the entry of the foreign\nretailers would have no negative effect on the \"  sari-sari\n store &rdquo; owners because foreign retailers would not be engaging\nin activities of that scale. \n\n\n  Protection  \n\n \n\nLotilla said the guidelines, which Neda prepared, would guarantee\nthe protection of so-called \" \" mom-and-pop &rdquo; businesses\n\" . \n\n \n\nHe explained that the selection of foreign firms would be based\non the track record of the applicants in their respective countries of origin\nto ensure that only quality retailers would be allowed to operate here. \n\n \n\nBoth the House of Representatives and the Senate have agreed in\nprinciple on the retail trade liberalization bill. \n\n \n\nSome issues however still have to be settled, including minimum\ncapitalization, level of equity ownership, and the time limit on the\n100-percent equity ownership privilege. \n\n\n  Clashing views  \n\n \n\nVarious parties are leaning toward a &peso;100-million minimum\ncapitalization for 100-percent equity ownership. \n\n \n\nThe Department of Trade and Industry ( DTI), on the other hand,\nhas proposed a minimum capitalization of &peso;80 million for 100-percent\nequity ownership but limited this to a period of two years. \n\n \n\nUnder this proposal, applicants after the two-year period would\nnot be able to enjoy the 100-percent equity ownership privilege anymore and\nwould have to settle for a maximum of 60 percent only. \n\n \n\nBut NEDA has taken the opposite stand.\n\n\nIt wants to stick to the &peso;100-million minimum capitalization and\ncompletely eliminate the time limit. \n\n \n\nLotilla expressed his concern that putting limits on the level of\nequity ownership and the time frame might discourage foreign firms from\ncoming in. \n\n\n  Main backer  \n\n \n\n \" It is high time that we opened up retail trade.\n\n\nLiberalization must be genuine and not a pseudo liberalization where\nyou can make things difficult, &rdquo;  Lotilla said. \n\n \n\nIn comparison, the retail trade sector of the other Asian\neconomies such as Indonesia offers wholesale and retail trade of up to\n100-percent foreign equity ownership in addition to 100-percent equity in all\nareas of the manufacturing sector. \n\n \n\nIn Thailand, the promotion of the retail trade sector is limited\nto expansion projects.\n\n\nA 100-percent foreign equity is also allowed but subject to various\nconditions. \n\n \n\nLotilla also noted that prospects for a speedy approval of the\ntrade liberalization bill remain very good considering that President Estrada\nhas given his full support to the piece of legislation. \n\n \n\n \" The focus is on the signals the President is\ngiving.\n\n\nHe is personally pushing for the retail trade liberalization, &rdquo;\n he said.  \n\n\n\n\n  Socialized housing gets same budget, Palace says \n\n\n \n\nSOCIALIZED housing will continue to get 80 percent of the funding\nallocated by the Estrada administration for its mass shelter program,\nMalaca&ntilde;ang assured the public yesterday. \n\n \n\nExecutive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora clarified that there has been\nno attempt to shift the focus of the administration 's housing program\ndespite the imminent entry of private developers. \n\n \n\n    \" Walang pagbabago  \n( No change). \n\n\nThere 's no attempt to reverse the percentages ( of housing\nallotment),\"  Zamora said in a radio interview. \n\n \n\nEven if private developers entered the housing program, he added,\nthey would follow market forces, which are likely to show that most\nprospective homeowners want socialized housing.  \n\n\nUnder the present housing program, socialized housing would get 80\npercent of the funding for shelter, while low-cost housing would get the\nremaining 20 percent. \n\n \n\n \" I don't think it will move far from 80-20.\n\n\nAs I see it, developers will follow the market forces, and most of\nthe market is really in that 80 percent bracket, &rdquo;  he said.\n\n\n \n\nThe socialized housing program offers the most affordable housing\nunits costing &peso;180,000 and below. \n\n \n\nFears of a change in focus surfaced after Karina David resigned\nlast week as chairman of the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating\nCouncil ( HUDCC). \n\n \n\nPresident Estrada in his radio program  \" Itawag Mo\nKay Erap &rdquo;  raised the possibility that he may appoint a\nreplacement for David, citing the importance accorded by his administration\nto the socialized housing program.\n\n\nIn the interim, the President has assumed David 's post. \n\n \n\n \" Probably, because I have a heavy work load and we\nneed someone to closely oversee the socialized housing program.\n\n\nThe chair 's job is monitoring and coordination, &rdquo;  the\nPresident said when asked whether he plans to appoint a new HUDCC chief. \n\n \n\nMeanwhile, Zamora said President Estrada 's order to lower\ninterest rates signals the start of stepped up efforts by the government to\nput a roof over the heads of the homeless. \n\n \n\nThe President ordered Tuesday the lowering of interest rates for\nsocialized housing from 16 percent to nine percent for loans with 30-year\nterms covering housing units worth &peso;180,000 or less. \n\n \n\nZamora said Malaca&ntilde;ang is hopeful Congress would approve\nadditional capitalization for the Home Insurance Guaranty Corp ( HIGC), from\n&peso;2 billion to &peso;50 billion. \n\n \n\n \" We need a lot more money for housing, and one of\nthe ways is by allowing HIGC to guarantee more, &rdquo;  he said in a\nradio interview. \n\n \n\nAccording to Zamora, the President aims to construct up to\n400,000 housing units every year in the next five years. \n\n \n\nMr. Estrada also moved to bring down the monthly amortization\nfor socialized housing units by ordering that additional amortization support\nbe given through the  Abot Kaya Pabahay  Program. \n\n \n\nIn addition, he instructed the  PAG-IBIG  / Home\nMutual Fund Corp. and Home Insurance and Guarantee Corp. to immediately make\navailable to government employees housing units that have remained unoccupied\nup to now. \n\n \n\nDetermined to give the poor a decent shelter of their own during\nhis term, the President has assumed the post of housing  czar\n and made mass housing a centerpiece program of his pro-poor and\npro-business administration.  \n\n\n\n\n  Cronyism is dead, President assures  \n\n \n\nPRESIDENT Estrada reiterated yesterday that cronyism is dead and\nburied in his administration, saying none of his so-called cronies have\nreceived monetary assistance for their businesses from any government\nfinancing institutions ( GFIs).\n\n\nIn his weekly radio program  \" Itawag Mo Kay Erap,\n&rdquo;  the President said those who doubt his word can check\ngovernment documents to see for themselves if his administration has extended\nloans and other financial aid to the business ventures of his alleged\ncronies. \n\n \n\nMr. Estrada also refused to give a negative spin to the reported\nstatement regarding cronyism of Vice-President Gloria Arroyo before East\nAsian economic and political leaders in a forum in Singapore. \n\n \n\nArroyo was reported to have said in a press conference following\nher speech at the East Asia Economic Summit that cronyism is not good\ngovernance but stressed that President Estrada has consistently made it clear\nthat no government favors were given to businessmen perceived to be close to\nhim, like Lucio Tan of Philippine Airlines ( PAL), Eduardo Cojuangco of San\nMiguel Corp. ( SMC), and Mark Jimenez. \n\n \n\n \" The Vice-President noted that as I have\nrepeatedly said, businessmen who have been identified as close to me did not\nget even a single cent from GFIs  .\n\n\nThere is cronyism when friends of the President are able to wangle\nfavor from the government, &rdquo;  Mr. Estrada said. \n\n \n\n \" Since I assumed the presidency, neither\nCojuangco nor Tan was able to get a single cent of concession or loans from\nGFIs, &rdquo;  the President said. \n\n \n\n \" So there is no cronyism in my administration.\n\n\nThis is a documented fact, and they can inspect the records of GFIs,\n&rdquo;  he added. \n\n \n\nIn the case of Tan, the President had rejected appeals by the\nbusinessman to bail out the hemorrhaging PAL in line with his policy against\nusing public money to subsidize distressed private firms. \n\n \n\nThe President had also made it clear that Cojuangco was able to\nregain control of the SMC board not because of the latter 's alleged Palace\nconnection but because he was voted as chairman by board members appointed by\nthe previous administration.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "b3bd42e6-8887-43b1-ab75-7c750f682d9d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.286714+00:00"}
{"text": "Long break awaits execs of Kalookan  \n\n\n Dona Policar and Michael Sadim \n\n \n\nIF MALACA&Ntilde;ANG approves a recommendation of the Department\nof Interior and Local Government ( DILG), the Kalookan city government will\nfind itself without a mayor, a vice mayor, and eight councilors for six\nmonths. \n\n \n\nThis is because the DILG has recommended the six-month suspension\nof Kalookan City Mayor Reynaldo Malonzo and eight other officials for alleged\nmalversation of public funds amounting to &peso;39 million. \n\n \n\nDILG Undersecretary Ronaldo Puno said Malonzo 's admission to\ncharges of double appropriation of funds have left the DILG with no recourse\nbut to recommend his suspension. \n\n \n\n \" Since he admitted it,  wala na kaming\noption   except to\nrecommend the penalty ( of six months suspension).\n\n\nIf he questions the jurisdiction over the matter, that is not up to us\nto decide.\n\n\n Sa iba nila itanong kung may jurisdiction talaga kami,\n  \"  Puno said in an interview with radio station DZMM. \n\n \n\nDILG legal counsel Julius Raboca said President Estrada received\nthe recommendation for suspension yesterday morning.\n\n\nThe suspension order will reportedly be announced anytime this week.\n\n\n\n  Waiting for Erap  \n\n \n\nMalonzo and eight council members, including actors Dennis\nPadilla and Tito Valera, are just waiting for President Estrada, concurrent\nDILG secretary, to issue the suspension order after Puno forwarded his\nrecommendation the other day. \n\n \n\nThe six other officials who were included in the list are Vice\nMayor Oscar Malapitan, and councilors Chito Abel, Benjamin Manlapig, Edgar\nErice, Zaldy Dolatre, Susan Punzalan and Henry Cammayo. \n\n \n\nPuno explained that since the case filed against Malonzo and his\nsix officials was administrative in nature,  \" it is but natural\nfor us to submit a recommendation to the Office of the President. &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\nAccording to Puno, Malonzo admitted that his council had indeed\nused the &peso;39-million fund for purposes other than what it was intended\nfor. \n\n \n\nBut Malonzo claimed there was nothing wrong with it, since former\nmayor Macario \" Boy &rdquo; Asistio, his predecessor, had done the same\nthing during his term.\n\n\nBesides, he said, Administrative Order No. 47 signed by then\nPresident Fidel Ramos gave local executives the power to move or transfer\nfunds. \n\n\n  Political move?  \n\n \n\nMalonzo, who defeated Asistio thrice in a row, said the charges\nwere instigated by his political rivals.\n\n\nHe questioned the DILG for allowing Raboca to handle the case, saying\nthe latter was a close associate of Asistio. \n\n \n\nHe said the Department of Budget and Management is the more\nproper agency that should be giving the needed recommendation to\nMalaca&ntilde;ang. \n\n \n\nMalonzo and his men 's case stemmed from a complaint filed by\nEduardo Tibor, a  barangay  secretary and alleged supporter of\nAsistio. \n\n \n\nTibor filed dishonesty, abuse of authority, misconduct and\nalleged conspiracy against the city officials for passing City Ordinance No.\n9254 which transferred some &peso;39 million worth of unexpended funds to\nsupport the supplemental budget of the city for 1998. \n\n \n\nThe amount was taken from the original &peso;50-million budget\nallotted for the construction of a bus terminal along North Diversion Road.\n\n\n \n\nThe project, however, did not materialize since Malabon officials\nclaimed the 89-hectare where the terminal was supposed to be built was within\ntheir jurisdiction and not Kalookan 's. \n\n \n\nThus, Kalookan officials reverted the &peso;39 million to the\ncity government 's supplemental budget for salary, cash gifts and incentives\nfor casual and regular employees. \n\n \n\nOriginally, the accused were charged with three cases of\nmisappropriation of funds in connection with the city 's budget for 1998.\n\n\n \n\nThey were exonerated from the two other cases but they failed to\ncontest the remaining case.  \n\n\n\n\n  Selective phone metering mulled  \n\n\n Aries Rufo \n\n \n\nA SELECTIVE version of the controversial telephone metering\nscheme might still proceed despite opposition from consumers. \n\n \n\nThis possibility surfaced yesterday when Department of\nTransportation and Communication ( DOTC) Secretary Vicente Rivera announced\nhe is working on the compromise plan to break an impasse on the issue without\nrisking the survival of affected telephone companies. \n\n \n\nRivera made the disclosure after he emerged from a Senate\nhearing, where he testified and enlightened the lawmakers regarding issues\nsurrounding the DOTC 's local measured service ( LMS) program, or phone\nmetering scheme. \n\n \n\nBut Manuel Pangilinan, president of Philippine Long Distance\nTelephone Co. ( PLDT), immediately rejected a parallel Senate proposal to\nwork out a  \" special arrangement,\"  which will cushion\nthe scheme 's impact on business and appease ordinary subscribers. \n\n \n\nPangilinan said the proposal might run counter to the equal\nprotection clause embodied in the Constitution. \n\n \n\n \" The potential issue on the selective scheme, is\nthat we might be accused of favoring one to the other, &rdquo;  he\nsaid. \n\n \n\nRivera earlier ordered the National Telecommunications Commission\n( NTC), to recall a 1998 order, giving PLDT a provisional authority to meter\nlocal calls of subscribers.\n\n\nPLDT is the country 's biggest telephone company. \n\n \n\nBut yesterday Rivera said he had issued a new order to the NTC,\nthis time, instructing the DOTC-attached agency to study a selective phone\nmetering scheme. \n\n \n\n \" There are pros and cons, advantages and\ndisadvantages with the phone metering scheme, &rdquo;  he stressed.\n\n\n \n\nRivera, however, did not disclose what criteria will NTC use in\nselecting areas or sectors to be included--or exempted--from the metering\nscheme. \n\n \n\nNTC earlier reserved its stand on the issue, because of the\nvigorous opposition of consumer groups and high-tech firms that provide\ninternet service to their own subscribers.\n\n\nThese so-called Internet service providers ( ISPs) use phone lines to\nreach their own subscriber base. \n\n \n\nBut Rivera said there is basis to PLDT 's argument that phone\nmetering will discourage  \" telebabad, &rdquo;  or the\nextended and unproductive use of a telephone unit. \n\n \n\nPLDT was supposed to start the program in May 1999 by introducing\nit in franchise areas outside Metro Manila.\n\n\nThe program was supposed to be introduced in Metro Manila the\nfollowing month. \n\n \n\nUnder the stalled metered scheme, subscribers will pay 40\ncentavos per minute of call that exceeds 800 \" free &rdquo; minutes per\nmonth. \n\n \n\nSubscribers actually pay a flat rate for the first 800 minutes of\ncall per month.\n\n\nThe flat rate amounts to &peso;348 for residential subscribers and\n&peso;748 for business subscribers.  \n\n\n\n\n  RP sells another &dollar;200-M global bonds in the US\n \n\n\n Jun T. Ebias \n\n \n\nTHE Philippines yesterday sold another &dollar;200 million in\n20-year global bonds in the US, adding to the &dollar;500 million bonds sold\nearly January, to take advantage of the recent decline in US interest rates.\n\n\n \n\nFinance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said the government plans to\nissue more bonds to replace its short-term foreign debts with long-term\nobligations. \n\n \n\nThe flotation of the additional &dollar;200 million bonds brought\nto &dollar;700 million its 20-year benchmark bonds maturing in 2019. \n\n \n\nEarly last month, the government issued &dollar;1 billion global\nbonds of which &dollar;500 million have a 20-year maturity while the balance\nmature in 10 years. \n\n \n\nThe Philippines became the first among the crisis-hit countries\nin Asia to issue the bonds.\n\n\nIt was also the Estrada administration 's first sovereign bond issue\nin the US. \n\n \n\nThe &dollar;1 billion bond issue received an overwhelming\nresponse from international investors as total subscription reached\n&dollar;2.5 billion, over 20 percent higher than the &dollar;750 million\noffering. \n\n \n\nThe &dollar;200 million new issue has a coupon rate of 9.787\npercent, 436 basis points over the benchmark US Treasury, slightly lower than\nthe 9.875 percent rate that the earlier 20-year bonds got. \n\n \n\nThe bond issue was managed by JP Morgan & Co., Morgan Stanley\nDean Witter & Co., and Warburg Dillon Read. \n\n \n\nThe government plans to issue some &dollar;500 million bonds in\nEurope early next month following the warm response it got on its &dollar;1\nbillion global bonds in January. \n\n \n\n \" The global bonds and Eurobonds will not be the\nlast for this year, &rdquo;  Espiritu said. \n\n \n\nGovernment officials would stage a road show on Feb. 21 to 28 in\nsix key cities in Europe namely Paris, Frankfurt, Zurich, Milan, Madrid, and\nLondon.\n\n\nA five to 10-year maturity is being eyed for the Eurobonds.  \n\n\n\n\n  Oil firms warned against abuse  \n\n \n\nFOLLOWING reports of yet another round of fuel price increases,\nMalaca&ntilde;ang reiterated yesterday its warning to oil firms not to abuse\nthe situation with unreasonable actions that will cause greater misery to the\npeople, especially the poor. \n\n \n\nSecretary Edgardo Espiritu of the Department of Finance ( DOF)\nsaid President Estrada has repeatedly sent concerned government officials to\nrelay this message to the oil companies. \n\n \n\n \" The President has been communicating with these\noil firms.\n\n\nHe has sent Secretary Mario Tiaoqui of the Department of Energy to do\nthis, &rdquo;  Espiritu said in a radio interview. \n\n \n\nHe added that moral suasion appears to be the only practical\nsolution to the situation because the government has no control over oil\nprice increases which are dictated by global markets. \n\n \n\n \" We are telling the oil firms that while there is\nnothing wrong with making money, it should not be at the expense of the\npeople, &rdquo;  he said. \n\n \n\nWhile the government cannot intervene in the pricing of fuel in\nview of the deregulation of the oil industry, Espiritu said oil firms should\nnot abuse the situation. \n\n \n\n \" We have deregulated the oil industry, we are\ncommitted to free market, but oil firms should not abuse the situation,\n&rdquo;  he said. \n\n \n\nPresident Estrada, for his part, said he and Secretary Tiaoqui\nhave not stopped appealing to oil companies to defer the increases. \n\n \n\n\" We have not spared efforts to stop the oil price hikes.\n\n\nThe only thing I have not done is kneel down before these oil\ncompanies, &rdquo;  the President said in his program, \n\" Itawag Mo Kay Erap. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nBut the President said he is willing to do that for the sake of\nthe people if such act would bring down the oil prices. \n\n \n\n \" If by kneeling down we can stop the oil price\nhikes, then I would do it for the sake of our people, &rdquo;  Mr.\nEstrada said. \n\n \n\nDespite this, though, Espiritu said prospects remain bright for\nthe economy for the last quarter of 1999, following the continued high growth\nposted by the agriculture sector. \n\n \n\nEspiritu said most of the beneficiaries of the agricultural boom\nare in the rural areas where the majority of the people rely on agriculture\nfor livelihood. \n\n \n\n \" Our farmers are experiencing improvements in\ntheir lives.\n\n\nGrowth may not be felt in the cities, but it is now felt in the\nprovinces where many residents rely on agriculture, &rdquo;  he said.\n \n\n\n\n\n  House to look into sale of military camps  \n\n \n\nDISAPPOINTED over the implementation of a law calling for the\nprivatization of several military camps in the country, the House leadership\nhas formed an oversight committee that would evaluate whether the law passed\nby Congress has been effective. \n\n \n\nSpeaker Manuel Villar, in creating a Special Oversight Committee\non Bases Conversion and Development, designated Assistant Majority Leader\nAllan Peter Cayetano as chairman with 10 others as members.\n\n\nMost of them come from Central Luzon. \n\n \n\nCayetano said the special committee will give priority in its\nevaluation to the unfulfilled obligations in the sale of Fort Bonifacio by\nthe Bases Conversion Development Authority ( BCDA), whose proceeds are\nsupposed to help fund the Armed Forces ' Modernization Program. \n\n \n\nThe evaluation will be used by the House as the basis for\namending Republic Act 7227 to make it a better and a more effective law. \n\n \n\nCayetano said the multibillion-peso proceeds from the camp 's\nsale would also help replenish the government 's coffers to finance its\npro-poor projects such as low-cost housing and agricultural modernization.\n\n\n \n\nThe government is eyeing the sale of other military camps\nfollowing the conversion of Fort Bonifacio, Camp John Hay, Clark and Subic to\nspecial economic zones. \n\n \n\nThe members of the oversight committee, aside from Cayetano, are\nReps.\n\n\nFrancis Nepomuceno ( Pampanga), Tony Diaz ( Zambales), Ding Briones (\nPasay), Bernardo Vergara ( Baguio), Jesli Lapuz ( Tarlac), Manuel Ortega ( La\nUnion), Zenaida Ducut ( Pampanga), Oscar Rodriguez ( Pampanga), and Gilberto\nTeodoro ( Tarlac). \n\n\nby SHE CAGUIMBAL-TORRES \n\n\n\n\n  'Sinking' earth menaces Metro  \n\n\n  Liquefaction during earthquake could occur in several\nareas  \n\n \n\n AREAS in Metro Manila lining Manila Bay and Laguna Lake\nare in great danger of being swallowed up by soil that liquefies during a\nstrong earthquake, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (\nPhilvolcs) has warned.  \n\n \n\nLiquefaction, according to Philvolcs, occurs in areas where the\nsoil is made up of loosely compacted, water-saturated sediments such as sand.\n\n\n \n\nThe movement during a strong quake could cause the underlying\nfoundation to become semi-liquid, Philvolcs said. \n\n \n\nStructures built with no special engineering designs against\nliquefaction tend to settle or sink as the earth underneath them loses\nstrength, Philvolcs said. \n\n \n\nPhilvolcs said the districts of Binondo, Intramuros, Paco,\nPandacan, Port Area, Quiapo, Sta. Cruz and Pasig City were affected by\nliquefaction in the past. \n\n \n\nNew reclaimed areas, especially those along Manila Bay, have\nlikewise been affected by liquefaction by recent earthquakes, Philvolcs said.\n\n\n \n\nStructures affected by liquefaction normally remain intact\nalthough some may tilt. \n\n \n\n \" Other associated liquefaction effects such as\nsand fountaining, lateral spreading and ground undulation may also cause\ndamage to bridges, roads and other infrastructures, &rdquo; \nPhilvolcs said. \n\n \n\nCiting previous earthquakes, Philvolcs said liquefaction has\ncaused extensive damage to various areas like Dagupan City. \n\n \n\nAt the same time, historical data indicate that liquefaction has\nselectively affected various parts of the Philippines. \n\n \n\nPhilvolcs liquefaction could occur in areas as far as about 50\nkm from the source of a magnitude 7 earthquake and 200 km in the case of\nmagnitude 7.3 quake. \n\n \n\nStudies of liquefied sites have shown that grain size, the depth\nof the water table, and thickness of the deposits influence an area 's\nsusceptibility to liquefaction. \n\n \n\n \" The soils in the city of Manila are very similar\nto those that have liquefied elsewhere, &rdquo;  Philvolcs said. \n\n \n\nThe identified liquefaction-prone areas have a\ncharacteristically shallow water table with thick piles of water-saturated\nfine sediments. \n\n \n\nThese areas are those on the shore areas of Manila including the\nnewly reclaimed portion of the Pasig River delta plain, the Marikina alluvial\nplain and those lying on the floodplain deposits and abandoned meanders of\nthe Pasig and Marikina Rivers. \n\n \n\nAmong areas classified under high liquefaction zones include:\n\n\n* Reclaimed areas\n\n\n* Manila proper except the extreme north northwest districts\n\n\n* Malabon and Navotas\n\n\n* Western portion of Valenzuela\n\n\n* Extreme northwest part of Pasay and Para&ntilde;aque and Las\nPi&ntilde;as\n\n\n* Southwestern half of Caloocan City\n\n\n* Lakeshore areas immediately adjacent to Laguna de Bay that include\nparts of Muntinlupa and Taguig, Pateros, central Pasig, extreme western parts\nof Marikina and extreme eastern Quezon City", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c333ff03-5104-4234-a0bb-5062052b2c5b", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.288253+00:00"}

Almonte, former Presidential\nCommittee on Good Government chairman Jovito Salonga, Makati Congressman\nJoker Arroyo, former Solicitor General Sedfrey Ordo&ntilde;ez and businessman\nMichael de Guzman. \n\n \n\nThe House had investigated the Marcos wealth during the time of\nformer President Corazon Aquino, but the committee decided to call another\ninvestigation because of new revelations about the wealth. \n\n \n\nHuman rights lawyer Robert Swift revealed two weeks ago that the\nname of the Philippine president appeared in a certificate of deposit\nintended to withdraw the Marcos gold hoard. \n\n \n\n \" This issue on the Marcos gold, we feel that it is\na matter of national, public interest.\n\n\nThat being the case, we feel in the committee that we should look\ninto this case, &rdquo;  said Quirino Rep. Junie Cua, chairman of the\ncommittee on good government. \n\n \n\nCua said the probe will be different from the investigation\nundertaken in the Eighth Congress by the Special Committee on Public\nAccountability, then headed by Misamis Oriental Rep. Victorico Chavez. \n\n \n\n \" The investigation that will be conducted is\ndifferent from the earlier probe since the former dealt with the Marcos Swiss\naccounts.\n\n\nWe will now zero in on the alleged sale of Marcos gold, &rdquo;\n Cua said. \n\n \n\nMeanwhile, the President revealed yesterday the results of the\ninvestigation conducted by the Presidential Commission on Good Government (\nPCGG) on the allegations by its former agent, Reiner Jacobi, that the\nPhilippine government had participated in the laundering of the alleged\nMarcos gold deposits in Switzerland. \n\n \n\nThe inquiry showed that the claims of Jacobi are false and its\ndocuments fake, PCGG Chairman Magtanggol Gunigundo reported to President\nRamos in a confidential memorandum which the President made public yesterday.\n\n\n \n\nThe President directed Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Renato\nCayetano to review the PCGG report, entitled \" \" The Jacobi\nClaim, &rdquo; \" in coordination with Gunigundo, in light of the\ngovernment 's plan to sue human rights lawyer Robert Swift for maligning Mr.\nRamos ' reputation by accusing him of having a Swiss bank account. \n\n \n\nSwift got his story from Jacobi. \n\n \n\nThe President directed Cayetano to give him a feedback on the\nmatter not later than Oct. 18, 1997. \n\n \n\nThe highlight of the PCGG report was the existence of two Dr.\nRitters in the alleged Marcos gold hoard memorandum: the fake and the real\none. \n\n \n\nGunigundo also said the banner headline of the October 1 issue of\na newspaper \" \" Marcos Gold Deal--Swiss Witness Tags FVR, Then\nRetracts, &rdquo; \" was  \" misleading and erroneous.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nHe informed the President that  \" retraction\npresupposes that the real Dr. P.

{"text": "Peso gains another 27&centavo;  \n\n\n Donabelle Gatdula \n\n \n\nTHE PESO yesterday rose by about 27 centavos despite the fall of\nother currencies, posting a weighted average rate of &peso;32.883 to a dollar\ncompared to last Friday 's &peso;33.156. \n\n \n\nTraders said the peso depreciation could be attributed to the\ndecision of the  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas  ( BSP) to\ncontinue intervening in the foreign exchange market. \n\n \n\nBank sources said BSP 's intervention accounted for 60% of the\ntotal transaction of &dollar;172.5 million in yesterday 's trading at the\nPhilippine Dealing System ( PDS). \n\n \n\nWith the rise of the peso and with liquidity going back to normal,\nofficials predicted that interest rates on peso borrowings would drop. \n\n \n\nHowever, the cost of the overnight borrowing of banks or interbank\ncall loan rates ( IBCLR) remained high at 150% from Friday 's 90%, a fact\nthat officials consider a problem. \n\n \n\nBSP Gov. Gabriel Singson said the BSP would look into this unusual\nincrease in IBCLR, which remained high despite efforts of the central\nmonetary authority to bring down interest rates. \n\n \n\nThe governor said the IBCLR should correspondingly drop as T bill\nyields decline and the pressure on the peso eases. \n\n \n\n \" I don't know why these interest rates are still\ngoing up despite the end of the mopping up operations of the BSP, &rdquo;\n Singson said. \n\n \n\nThe central bank 's offer to sell dollars at &peso;32.90 buoyed\nthe local currency, with banks taking their cue and lowering their earlier\noffers of &peso;33 and above for the dollar. \n\n \n\nAt midmorning the peso averaged 32.\n\n\nHowever, it finally closed at &peso;32.883.\n\n\nAt one time, it registered a rate of &peso;32.75 to a dollar. \n\n \n\nTraders said the central bank 's early intervention in the market\nwas the main reason for the peso 's appreciation, noting that the Malaysian\n ringgit  , Indonesian  rupiah  and\nThai  baht  were all lower against the dollar in morning\ntrading. \n\n \n\nThe  rupiah  weakened in reaction to a ratings\ndowngrade on Indonesia by Standard and Poor 's over the weekend.\n\n\nThe  baht  was weaker due to corporate demand for\ndollars, traders said. \n\n \n\nTraders said a recent BSP rule barring banks with excess dollars\nfrom tapping its overnight lending facility also helped the peso. \n\n \n\nThe stronger peso and prospects for lower interest rates also\nboosted sentiments on the stock market. \n\n \n\nStocks inched higher in early trading as investors continued to\nhunt for bargains among fundamentally sound blue-chip issues, traders said.\n \n\n\n\n\n  Ramos can't wait, leaves key bills unsigned  \n\n\n Manuel Sanchez \n\n \n\nPRESIDENT Ramos yesterday left for a six-day trip abroad\ndisappointed that the bicameral committee working for the passage of the\nCommon Legislative Agenda ( CLA) reportedly failed to deliver it to him for\nsigning. \n\n \n\nDuring his luncheon meeting with members of the House last week,\nthe President had expected at least five bills to be signed before he went on\nanother trip. \n\n \n\nAmong the bills which he was supposed to sign were the last\ncomponent of the Comprehensive Tax Reform Program ( CTRP), the Anti-Squatting\nBill and the Ancestral Domain Act. \n\n \n\nMr. Ramos had even made last-minute changes in his schedule,\nhoping the bills would be delivered to him.\n\n\nHe was supposed to leave from the Ninoy Aquino International Airport\n( NAIA) but he chose to fly from the Villamor Airbase for his visit to Hong\nKong, Myanmar and Laos. \n\n \n\nThe President also did not read his prepared speech.\n\n\nHowever, the Presidential News Desk ( PNA) distributed copies of that\nspeech to the media. \n\n \n\nIn his unread speech, Mr. Ramos said his visit to Hong Kong\nSpecial Administrative Region ( SAR) aims to convey three messages:\n\n\n* That the Philippine economy remains essentially sturdy--strong and\nstable enough to weather the currency storm now battering the entire region.\n\n\n* That the confidence stems not only from claims by Philippine\nofficials, but from assessment of facts by no less than the leading\ninternational financial and economic institutions.\n\n\n* That the Philippines has forged a fresh national consensus on how\nto cope with the passing storm - - and to even move beyond it - - by pushing\non with the primary target to attain full economic tigerhood. \n\n \n\nThe President said he will put across those messages to the Sixth\nEast Asian Summit of the World Economic Forum ( WEF) - - a gathering of\naround 150 chiefs of the world 's top corporations. \n\n \n\nHe is also expected to deliver the same messages before the Asia\nHouse of Hong Kong that groups the stewards of Hong Kong-based and mainland\nChina-based conglomerates. \n\n \n\nThe President said he will invoke that the Philippines is not a\ndomino - - that by the sheer pressure of other faltering dominos, it may be\nslightly shaking temporarily - - but will stay stable, competitive and\nattractive because of its sound socio-economic-political fundamentals. \n\n \n\nToday, the President will meet with Hong Kong Chief Executive\nTung Chee-hwa to take up the former British colony 's economic and trading\npolicies.\n\n\nIn this occasion, he will discuss with Chee-hwa the ongoing review of\nthe labor protection laws by Hong Kong 's Provisional Legislative Council to\nensure that the rights and welfare of some 150,000 overseas Filipino workers\nare guaranteed. \n\n \n\nFulfilling the country 's regional responsibilities, the\nPresident said that the Philippines, being the chairman of the Asean Standing\nCommittee and of the Asean Regional Forum ( ARF), should enhance the\nfraternal bond by opening opportunities to revitalize the country 's\nbilateral ties with Laos and Myanmar, the grouping 's new members.  \n\n\n\n\n  Go-signal to attack MILF awaited  \n\n\n Edith Alejandro \n\n \n\nMILITARY and police authorities are waiting for President Ramos '\n\" green light &rdquo; to attack the  Moro  Islamic\nLiberation Front ( MILF), which is set to execute five more criminals on\nFriday. \n\n \n\n \" We are waiting for the go-signal from the\nPresident.\n\n\nWe have to observe the cessation of hostilities.\n\n\nSince this is a political decision, we have to allow the government\npanel to resolve this.\n\n\nThis is the order from higher up since the Raja Muda incident,\n&rdquo;  Armed Forces Chief Arnulfo Acedera said yesterday. \n\n \n\nRaja Muda is the main MILF base in Pikit, North Cotabato. \n\n \n\nLast Monday, six MILF rebels shot to death two men tied to bamboo\npoles outside a public market in Masiu in Lanao del Sur province. \n\n \n\nThe men, including one Christian, were killed after being\nconvicted of robbery and murder by the MILF 's Islamic court. \n\n \n\nAcedera has sent about 1,000 soldiers to support the Philippine\nNational Police ( PNP) Regional Command in keeping peace and order in the\nregion. \n\n \n\nPNP Director General Recaredo Sarmiento however, disclosed\nthat they could only make an appeal to the MILF to put off the Friday\nexecution. \n\n \n\n \" Let us not put the law in our own hands, as the\nPNP will be acting according to Philippine laws, &rdquo;  Acedera\nsaid. \n\n \n\nHe expressed confidence that the MILF would heed the PNP 's\nappeal. \n\n \n\nSarmiento also has directed Sr. Supt. Franco Calida, director of\nthe PNP-Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao ( ARMM), to coordinate with the\nSouthern Command of the Armed Forces of the Phils. ( AFP) and ARMM Gov. Nur\nMisuari. \n\n \n\nAcedera and Sarmiento 's statements came in the wake of Speaker\nJose de Venecia 's claims that the MILF has agreed to stop the public\nexecutions. \n\n \n\nDe Venecia said he talked to Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice chairman\nfor political affairs, who informed the Speaker that the MILF will stop the\nexecution of Christians even if they are found guilty by the rebel group 's\n Shariah  court. \n\n \n\nDe Venecia 's statement, however, contradicts that made by Al Hal\nMurad, MILF military affairs chief, who said that the carrying out of death\nsentences is  \" non-negotiable. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" We cannot stop this because this is a religious\nobligation, &rdquo;  Murad said in a telephone interview with\nAssociated Press.\n\n\n \" We cannot compromise. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nMurad said his group also would use force to stop police from\nentering a rebel camp in southern Maguindanao province to arrest rebels who\npublicly executed two men last week as he warned of  \" a\nfull-blown war\"  in Mindanao.  \n\n\n\n\n  Almonte: FVR never knew of \" 'Big Bird' \"\n \n\n\n Eric Garafil and Rey Requejo \n\n \n\nPRESIDENT Ramos knew little about \" \" Operation Big\nBird, &rdquo; \" the government 's botched effort to retrieve the\nhidden wealth of the Marcoses, National Security Adviser Jose Almonte\nyesterday told the House good government committee. \n\n \n\nAlmonte said Mr. Ramos only knew of the operation after he\nbriefed Mr. Ramos that his name had been dragged into the search for the\nhidden wealth of the Marcoses. \n\n \n\nAlmonte said President Corazon Aquino issued verbal orders for\nhim to proceed with \" Operation Big Bird \" , and had given\nhim two letters of authorization dated Aug. 9 and Sept. 9, 1986. \n\n \n\n \" President Ramos, who was then Chief of Staff of\nthe Armed Forces and my immediate superior, at the outset, did not know about\nit, &rdquo;  he testified. \n\n \n\nAlmonte said  \" I merely told him that the President\n( Aquino) wanted me to recover the Marcos assets in Switzerland with the help\nof Mr. Michael de Guzman and he did not want to know the details, &rdquo;\n saying the present Chief Executive 's not probing into his\nexplanation  \" showed the discipline of President Ramos. &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\nCongressman Joker Arroyo, the committee chairman, questioned\nAlmonte intensively, stressing that it was only in 1989 that the security\nchief had  \" militarized &rdquo;  his project and\nchristened it \" Big Bird \" . \n\n \n\nReferring to the 20% commission reportedly asked by Almonte for\nthe recovery of the gold, Arroyo said:  \" What Mr. Almonte could\nnot get during the Aquino administration, he could thus get 100% under the\nRamos government. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThe Senate blue ribbon committee continued its own inquiry into\nthe Marcos gold, with Sen. Miriam Defensor-Santiago urging committee chairman\nSen. Franklin Drilon to check reports that at least three Central Bank ( CB)\ngovernors conspired to transfer gold reserves amounting to some &peso;61.2\nbillion into the Swiss accounts of former President Marcos. \n\n \n\nDefensor-Santiago said Drilon 's committee  \" must\nimmediately subpoena  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas  ( BSP) Gov.\nGabriel Singson and his predecessor Jaime Laya. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nFormer Ilocos Norte Rep. Ferdinand \" Bongbong &rdquo;\nMarcos Jr. said he welcomes Laya 's inclusion in the probe but doubted if\ninvestigators will turn up any evidence proving that a Marcos gold hoard\nreally exists.  \n\n\n\n\n  Solon presses for ouster of top NEA officials  \n\n \n\nA  LAKAS  congressman yesterday pressed for the\nouster of the administrator of the National Electrification Administration (\nNEA) and six officials for graft and corruption resulting from alleged\nviolations of the Public Bidding Law. \n\n \n\nRep. Antonio Bengson (  Lakas  , Pangasinan) said\nNEA Administrator  Prospero Marquez  had practically admitted through\npublished statements that the NEA had totally disregarded Presidential Decree\nNo. 1594 in the conduct of its public bidding and awarding of contracts for\nthe &dollar;192-million rural electrification revitalization program which\nwas funded by the World Bank and Japan 's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund\n( OECF). \n\n \n\n \" Administrator  Marquez  is either ignorant\nof the law or just plain stupid to simply brush aside the mandatory legal\nrequirements in NEA 's bidding and awarding of multi-million peso contracts,\n&rdquo;  Bengson said. \n\n \n\nBengson said  Marquez  's press releases and a letter to\nRep. Mar Roxas of Capiz have very damaging and incontrovertible evidences on\nthe rigging and manipulation of contracts and other irregularities committed\nby the NEA officials. \n\n \n\nIn denying anomalies at the NEA,  Marquez  said: \n\" The mandatory requirements under PD 1594 which the NEA allegedly\ndisregarded were not applicable to the NEA 's procurement function because it\nwas funded by foreign financial institutions. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n Marquez  also clarified that  \" it was not\nwithin NEA 's authority to set a policy on 'lone bidder' situation as the\nguidelines were prescribed by foreign lending institutions. &rdquo; \n\n\n \n\nBengson explained that  Marquez  willfully violated the\nPublic Bidding Law when the NEA dispensed with the provisions of public\nbidding, evaluation and awarding of contracts under the NEA 's\n&dollar;5-billion rural electrification project. \n\n \n\nHe explained that there is conflict between the World Bank and\nOECF loan guidelines and PD 1594 which mandates public bidding compulsory for\nall government contracts. \n\n \n\nBengson said there is no provision in the loan guidelines of the\nWorld Bank and the OECF which specifically dispenses with public bidding.\n\n\n \n\nAnd, granting that there is a conflict, Bengson said PD 1594\nshould prevail because it is a policy law and superior to  \" any\nof the so-called escape clauses that  Marquez  and his NEA henchmen\nhad contemptuously but erroneously peddled in their public statements.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nAdditionally, Bengson said, there is no legal excuse to do away\nwith the mandate of PD 1594 for the following reasons:\n\n\n*  Marquez  and other NEA personnel are government officials.\n\n\n* All the materials and equipment procured by the NEA will be used in\nthe country.\n\n\n* Public funds will be used to pay off the World Bank and OECF loans.\n\n\n \n\nBengson said:  Marquez  's statement on PD 1594 virtually\nsinks him deeper into the quagmire of corruption and mismanagement that he\nhad created at the NEA and also paves the way for his expeditious and\nignominious exit from the government service.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "caeac9a4-5f81-47e0-8694-5afd09fa1e20", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.290823+00:00"}
{"text": "Currency crisis benefits banks  \n\n\n Manuel Cayon \n\n \n\nDAVAO CITY--\n\n\nThe profit profile of the country 's banks last year has bolstered\ncriticism that they are making a windfall in the ongoing currency crisis.\n\n\n \n\nIn his first public speech after his resignation took effect\nyesterday, former Presidential Assistant for Mindanao Paul Dominguez said\nsome of the banks have admitted they cornered as much as 75 percent of their\nprofit during the last quarter of last year. \n\n \n\n \" Meaning to say that you 're going to see, when the\nbanks start publishing the figures, that they made a tremendous amount of\nmoney in October, November and December when the rates went up, &rdquo;\n Dominguez said. \n\n \n\nA document showing the banks ' prime lending rates shows that the\nrate went up as much as 25 percent this week, from 20 percent in August last\nyear, and 15 percent before the currency crisis started on July 11, 1997.\n\n\n \n\n \" As you all know, this is not the real situation\nbecause many have already charged as high as 29 percent, &rdquo; \nDominguez said.\n\n\nHe did not disclose which banks made a heavy profit and how much they\nmade last year. \n\n \n\nOn the contrary, Dominguez pointed out the wide disparity in the\ninterest the banks were giving to domestic savings.\n\n\n \" Up to now, they 're still paying four percent on your\nsavings, for the thousands and thousands and hundreds of million of pesos in\nyour deposits, lending them at 31 percent and making real hefty margins.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nDominguez urged the members of the Mindanao Business Council (\nMBC), an affiliate of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry,\n \" to make a lot of noise &rdquo;  about the high\ninterest rate. \n\n \n\n \" Be very active in articulating the needs of the\nbusiness community in Mindanao, but keep the morale high, &rdquo;

 \n\n \n\n \" There are only losers in high interest rates.\n\n\nThey kill everybody, discourage investments; they make business\nexpensive, they make any expansion prohibitive.\n\n\nThat is the single risky thing that is going to stop the Mindanao\nrecovery, &rdquo;

 a source said. \n\n \n\nForeigh Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon, Jr. had earlier\nannounced that an interagency body agreed to formulate a scheme that would\nallow businessmen in Southeast Asia to use the local currencies instead of US\ndollars in trading goods. \n\n \n\nSiazon said Malaysia and Thailand would likely support the\nPhilippines on the proposed trading system. \n\n \n\nHe said the Indonesian  rupiah  , however,\nremained unstable and it would be hard to convince businessmen to use the\nvolatile  rupiah  . \n\n \n\nHowever, some businessmen are not enthusiastic about the idea\nbecause the intra-Asean trade is not too big to make a significant progress\nin stabilizing their currencies. \n\n \n\nSources said Ramos and Mahathir could also discuss the regional\nsecurity that could be affected by the economic crisis. \n\n \n\nIndonesian observers fear that the declining  rupiah\n and the growing unemployment in that country could lead to\npolitical instability. \n\n \n\nRestive Indonesians are expected to wage more protests when the\ngovernment removes the subsidies in basic items that were recommended by the\nInternational Monetary Fund.  \n\n\n\n\n  Teachers refuse poll duty  \n\n\n Karen Tiongson \n\n \n\nMAJORITY of the public school teachers do not want to serve as\npoll officials in the May 11 elections and want to be given the choice to\nreject such assignments. \n\n \n\nCiting partial results of its survey, the Alliance of Concerned\nTeachers ( ACT) said that 85 percent of the 420,000 public school teachers in\nthe country want to be relieved of their poll duties. \n\n \n\nElection after election, the Commission on Elections ( Comelec)\ncompels the public school teachers to serve as poll inspectors in the\nballoting and the registration of voters. \n\n \n\nCiting the recent cases of harassment and the government 's\nfailure to pay the teachers their honoraria, the group wants the Comelec to\ngive them the freedom to decide whether to accept or reject poll duties. \n\n \n\nThe group met with the Manila Public School Teachers '\nAssociation and officials of the Department of Education, Culture and Sports\nyesterday to thrash out the problem. \n\n \n\nThey passed a resolution containing the teachers ' sentiment and\nwill submit it to the Comelec this week. \n\n \n\nRaymund Villanueva, the spokesman for ACT, said the teachers feel\nharassed after some of their colleagues were arrested last month on charges\nthat they were involved in election fraud. \n\n \n\nLast week, 18 teachers at L. Avance&ntilde;a High School in\nQuezon City and nine school principals in San Jose del Monte, Bulacan, were\narrested by the police on charges of fraud filed by defeated candidates. \n\n \n\nThe teachers complain that they expose themselves to danger when\nthey serve as poll inspectors, but that they are not paid their honoraria on\ntime, he said. \n\n \n\nVillanueva said the Comelec still owes the teachers &peso;17\nmillion in honoraria in last year 's  barangay  elections and\nthe last registration of voters.\n\n\nComelec and the Department of Budget and Management are tossing the\nblame on each other for the unpaid  per diems  of 400,000\npublic school teachers, he said. \n\n \n\nPartial results of an ongoing national survey among the 420,000\npublic school teachers showed that 85 percent of them do not want to serve in\nthe May elections. \n\n \n\nAt least 90 percent of the teachers in Central Luzon object\nstrongly to serving as election officials in the May elections. \n\n \n\nVillanueva said the teachers have a constant fear of being\ncharged with election anomalies by the defeated candidates and of the dangers\nthat go with the job.\n\n\nHe cited the killing of two teachers in the 1995 elections.\n\n\nOne was killed when he tried to keep ballot boxes from being taken by\ngoons in Batangas; the other drowned in Sulu while transporting ballot boxes.\n \n\n\n\n\n  104 feared dead in crash  \n\n\n  Cebu Pacific DC-9 fails to make it to Cagayan de Oro\n \n\n\n Butch Enerio \n\n \n\nA TWIN-JET airliner with 99 passengers and five crewmen\ndisappeared and apparently crashed while trying to land at Cagayan de Oro\nCity 's Lumbia Airport shortly before noon yesterday. \n\n \n\nWitnesses were quoted by the radio group \" React\n\" in Cagayan de Oro as saying that they saw the crash site in the\nmountainous area of Gingoog City, 30 miles from Lumbia Airport. \n\n \n\nMayor Antonio Cabingin of Claveria, Misamis Oriental received\nreports from residents near the 3,300-foot Mount Balatican, that they heard a\nloud explosion and saw  \" a big white thing &rdquo; \ngoing down in a heavily forested area. \n\n \n\nReports reaching the National Rescue Coordinating Center at\nVillamor Air Base said the aircraft, a twin-engine DC-9 with registry number\nRP-C1507, operated by Cebu Pacific Air owned by businessman John Gokongwei,\nwas last heard from at 10:48 p.m., when it was 37 miles away from the\nairport. \n\n \n\nThe plane 's pilot, Capt. Paulo Justo, and its first officer,\nCapt. Erwin Gulla, came from the Air Force.\n\n\nThe three other crewmembers are flight attendants Romeo Mendoza,\nArlene Victorino and Paula Stephanie Lombres. \n\n \n\nThe flight, CP-387, left the Manila Domestic Airport at 9:16 a.m.\nand was expected to arrive at Cagayan de Oro at 11:03 a.m. after a brief\ntechnical stop in Tacloban City. \n\n \n\nThe flight plan indicated Butuan as its alternative airport of\ndestination. \n\n \n\nThe last contact with the plane was at 10:48 p.m., when the pilot\nindicated that the plane was at 11,500 feet and descending at the rate of\n3,300 feet per minute.\n\n\nThis would have placed it 8,200 feet by 10:49 or already lower than\nthe nearby mountain ranges, making it difficult to avoid running smack into\nthem in bad weather, aviation experts said. \n\n \n\nDato Amirul Duran, manager of the Air Transportation Office (\nATO) Area 9, said the plane was due to land at Lumbia Airport in 15 minutes.\n\n\n \n\nWhen it did not do so after 30 minutes, the ATO conducted a\n\" communications search &rdquo; with other airports in Tacloban, Davao,\nSurigao and Cebu to confirm any sighting of the plane, but the search yielded\nnothing. \n\n \n\nDuran said,  \" We cannot ascertain the whereabouts\nof the plane or what happened until we physically see the plane. &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\nCol. Chris Datu, commanding officer of the Composite Air Support\nForce 10, said a search by his unit was called off due to thick clouds and\nstrong gusty winds. \n\n \n\n \" We do not want to cause apprehension among the\nrelatives of the passengers; that is why we do not want to confirm or deny\nwhether the plane has crashed, &rdquo;  said Datu. \n\n \n\nCebu Pacific spokesman Larry Zurita said the airline could not\nrelease the manifest at press time  \" unless we have confirmed\nexactly what happened to the plane. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nOne of the passengers is 21-year-old Fritzie Marte, a staffer at\nthe office of PDP  Laban  Rep. Erasmo Damasing of Cagayan de\nOro.\n\n\nDamasing said he had tried to stop Marte from flying so she could\nattend a hearing at the House of Representatives; but Marte could not cancel\na meeting with youth leaders in Cagayan de Oro City. \n\n \n\nInformation gathered by search and rescue authorities in Manila\nshowed that CP-387, after leaving Tacloban, flew over Butuan Airport,\napparently to use its navigational aid to find its way to Cagayan de Oro.\n\n\n \n\nVisibility in the area was down at the time, weathermen said.\n\n\n \n\nManila Rescue Coordinating Center authorities said Lumbia Airport\nofficials asked the Air Force to launch search-and-rescue operations after an\ninitial \" communications search &rdquo; failed to locate the plane.\n\n\n \n\nThree UH-IH Huey helicopters from the 505th Rescue Squadron were\ndispatched to conduct a search, concentrating on the immediate vicinity of\nCagayan de Oro City.\n\n\nThe search focused on several high mountains arrayed north to south\nbetween Butuan and Cagayan de Oro cities--the 8,300-foot-high Mount\nBalatucan, the 8,300-foot-high Mount Caluauan, Mount Capantan and Mount\nSinalagus, both 7,300 feet high. \n\n \n\nAirplanes traveling from Butuan to Lumbia Airport have to steer\nclear of the mountains, especially Caluayan and Balatucan, to avoid hitting\ntheir peaks.\n\n\nAviation authorities inquired from as far as Cebu, Tacloban,\nZamboanga, Davao, Palawan and General Santos about CP-387 's whereabouts, but\nreceived a negative reply. \n\n \n\nOn February 1, 1997, a Cessna Citation jet from Butuan took off\nbound for Cagayan de Oro airport to pick up then Defense Secretary Renato de\nVilla.\n\n\nThe executive jet was found a few days later near the peak of Mount\nBalatucan.\n\n\nThere were no survivors. \n\n \n\nRelatives of the passengers of CP-387 were advised to call\ntelephone numbers 638-663 or 638-6637 for inquiries.  \n\n\n\n\n  Senators balk at oil bill  \n\n\n Karlo Baylosis \n\n \n\nMEMBERS of the Bicameral Conference Committee on Energy are\ndeadlocked on the drafting of the final committee report on the new oil\nderegulation bill. \n\n \n\nThe bill 's approval was delayed by senators who want to enforce\nfull deregulation of the oil industry after President Ramos 's term expires\nin June.\n\n\nSen. Freddie Webb, chairman of the Senate contingent, has rejected\nthe committee report drafted by the House panel, which proposed to empower\nthe President to shorten the five-month transition period before full\nderegulation. \n\n \n\nWebb fears that Ramos will immediately cut the transition period\nto allow the oil companies to increase prices. \n\n \n\nThe House and Senate panels are deadlocked on the bill and the\nsenators demand more revisions in it. \n\n \n\nIndependent Rep.

{"text": "Rally goes on, Phisix soars 10.15 percent  \n\n\n Lawrence Agcaoili \n\n \n\nSHARE prices soared anew yesterday, extending their winning streak\nto six straight trading sessions -- a development attributed by analysts to the\nreturn of foreign funds to the region. \n\n \n\nThe 30-share Philippine composite index ( PHISIX), which posted\nits second-biggest single-day gain, closed 197.69 points or 10.15 percent\nhigher, to 2,145.70 points; the broader all-shares index rose 54.09 points,\nor 9.52 percent, to 622.12 points. \n\n \n\nIn percentage terms, the PHISIX posted the biggest single-day rise\nsince September 1987 when it rose 16.06 percent to end at 818.99 points. \n\n \n\nYesterday, the PHISIX went up as high as 202.09 points to 2,150.10\npoints a few minutes before closing. \n\n \n\nGainers outgunned decliners, 120 to 15, with 24 issues unchanged.\n\n\nValue turnover doubled to &peso;4.57 billion as foreign punters\ncontinued to accumulate oversold stocks. \n\n \n\nBrokers said Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. 's ( PLDT)\nover &dollar;1 gain in New York prompted the PHISIX to open strong, breaking\nthe 2,000-point resistance and then piercing through the second resistance\nlevel of 2,100 points in early trade. \n\n \n\nBuying was across-the-board with PLDT the most actively traded\nstock, closing &peso;65 higher at &peso;1,110.\n\n\nSome 657,520 shares worth &peso;711.77 million changed hands.\n\n\nIt accounted for 15.54 percent of the day 's value turnover. \n\n \n\nSapphire Securities Inc. research head Henry Ong said in an\ninterview that foreign fund managers are starting to accumulate blue-chip\nstocks such as PLDT, Manila Electric Co. Inc. ( Meralco), San Miguel Corp.,\nAyala Land Inc., Ayala Corp. and oversold second-line issues. \n\n \n\nHe revealed that some foreign fund managers are covering their\nshort positions made last year. \n\n \n\nHe expected the market to continue its rally before succumbing to\nprofit taking in the next few days. \n\n \n\n \" The market has gone up so fast and investors are\nexpected to cash in soon, &rdquo;  Ong warned. \n\n \n\nAbacus Securities Corp. said in its weekly report that foreign\nmoney may have sensed the potential value that Asian countries may offer in\nthe medium term on the assumption that the US economy is expected to\nexperience moderate growth. \n\n \n\n \" The scent of the bull will last if there is a\nfollow-through on perceptions made earlier, and the said perception will\nactually be backed by confirmations, &rdquo;  Abacus reported. \n\n \n\nThe securities firms also said that the mood of the local market\nwill be generally upbeat this week despite a possible breather due to\nprofit-taking. \n\n \n\nLast week 's climb was largely a result of the favorable\nobservations made by the US federal government regarding the direction of\nAsia.\n\n\nUS President Clinton also announced renewed funding support for the\nInternational Monetary Fund 's move to extend financial aid to ailing Asian\neconomies. \n\n \n\nAngping & Associates Securities Inc. research chief Gina Tan said\nin an interview that foreign-fund managers are looking anew at the Asian\nequities market after liquidating their stocks when the currency crisis\nstarted last July 1997. \n\n \n\nThe peso was effectively devalued in July. \n\n \n\nTan said the recovery will only be confirmed if the stock market\nsustains its high value turnover.\n\n\nThe market was previously trading below the &peso;1-billion level as\nforeign-fund managers, citing the volatility of the financial system in the\nregion, refused to invest. \n\n \n\nThe local bourse 's rally started last week after the release of\nbetter-than-expected economic figures for 1997.\n\n\nSocioeconomic Planning Secretary Cielito Habito reported that the\nexpansion of the country 's gross national product slowed down to 5.8 percent\nlast year from 1996 's 6.9 percent while the growth of the gross domestic\nproduct decelerated to 5.1 percent from 6.3 percent. \n\n \n\nShare prices of the PLDT affiliate cellular phone provider\n Pilipinas  Telephone Corp., rose &peso;0.55, or 15 percent,\nto &peso;4.10 per share. \n\n \n\nMeralco share prices continued to increase after it denied the\nallegation of state-run National Power Corp. , ( Napocor) that it was\novercharging customers.\n\n\nIts class \" B &rdquo; shares rose 17.18 percent to &peso;159\nper share, its class \" A &rdquo; shares gained &peso;3.50 or 3.62\npercent to &peso;100 per share. \n\n \n\nAll the market 's sub-indices went up with the property sector\nposting the biggest gain.\n\n\nIt went up by 126 points or 15.58 percent to &peso;926 and was\nfollowed by the bank and financial index, which rose 55 points or 12 percent\nto 522.11 points. \n\n \n\nProperty issues that went up were Ayala Land ( 16.66 percent),\nKuok Philippines Properties Inc. ( 44.74 percent), Filinvest Land Inc. (\n31.17 percent), Fil-Estate Land Inc. ( 15.35 percent) and SM Prime Holdings\nInc. ( 13.23 percent). \n\n \n\nAnalysts, however, advised investors to lock in on their profits\nas share prices may succumb to selling pressure in the next few days.\n\n\nHowever, analysts and traders said the general mood of the local\nequities market will still be upbeat.  \n\n\n\n\n  Ernie on the warpath  \n\n\n Butch Fernandez \n\n \n\nSENATE Minority Leader Ernesto Maceda, still smarting from his\nouster as Senate president, is apparently on a political  vendetta\n against candidates he suspects helped depose him. \n\n \n\nIn a news conference, Maceda listed opposition senatorial bets\nSens. Edgardo Angara, Blas Ople, Freddie Webb and Vicente Sotto III among\nthose he will not support. \n\n \n\nBut Maceda singled out Angara,  Laban ng Makabayang Masang\nPilipino  ( LAMMP) vice-presidential candidate, as topping his junk\nlist.\n\n\nBoth conspired in the 1996  coup  against current\nSenate President Neptali Gonzales that installed Angara in that position.\n\n\n \n\nNow Maceda suspects Angara as a principal in his own downfall.\n\n\nGonzales reclaimed the post from Maceda after a  coup\n supported by 17 senators two weeks ago. \n\n \n\nMaceda does not see Nationalist People 's Coalition ( NPC)\nfounding chairman Eduardo Cojuangco supporting Angara, and since most NPC\nmembers take the cue from Cojuangco, he believes it is unlikely that Angara\nwill get the backing of NPC stalwarts. \n\n \n\nMaceda admitted, however, another reason - -  \" it\nwill be difficult for me to [ persuade] the rank and file of the NPC to\nsupport Ople, Sotto and Webb. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nOple said in a statement, however, there was no reason for Maceda\nto accuse him of treachery.\n\n\n \" Until he ( Maceda) left as Senate president, I had\nbeen a steadfast and loyal supporter. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nSotto said he had no choice but to abide by the decision of LAMMP\nleaders to move against Maceda. \n\n \n\nAngara debunked Maceda 's claim that LAMMP had collapsed into a\nmere coalition between Angara 's  Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino\n ( LDP) and Vice President Joseph Estrada 's  Partido ng\nMasang Pilipino  ( PMP). \n\n \n\n \" [ The LAMMP] is still an alliance.\n\n\nIt does not impair the numerical strength of the LAMMP whether as a\ncoalition or a merger, &rdquo;  replied Angara, because the party\nremains a three-party alliance among the LDP, the PMP and the NPC. \n\n \n\nAt the local government level, squabblings among  Lakas\n - NUCD stalwarts could trigger an exodus of administration\ngrassroots leaders unless the party leadership finds the right formula for\nselecting candidates. \n\n \n\n Lakas  Rep. Bonifacio Gillego of Sorsogon, a\nthird-termer, said the selection of candidates for local government positions\nhas become  \" a serious problem, &rdquo;  and the\ndisputes could erode the administration 's clout at the grassroots level.\n\n\n \n\nIn his district alone, Gillego said at least six  Lakas\n members are vying for his seat in the House. \n\n \n\nThe situation in other districts is similar and even aggravated\nby the entry of the  Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino  into the\nrainbow coalition. \n\n \n\nThis developed as  Lakas  Rep. Raul del Mar of\nCebu disclosed that many  Lakas  leaders in the Visayas and\nMindanao will join the camp of former Cebu governor Emilio Osme&ntilde;a once\nhe files his candidacy for president on February 9. \n\n \n\nDel Mar himself will resign from the ruling party on that day to\ncampaign fulltime for Osme&ntilde;a. \n\n \n\nSen. Miriam Santiago, standard-bearer of the People 's Reform\nParty, urged the Catholic Bishops ' Conference of the Philippines \n\" to speak out on the candidates ' morality and political turncoatism.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nSantiago wants the bishops to be more specific in reaction to a\nCBCP statement that none of the presidential aspirants are entirely\nacceptable. \n\n \n\nSen. Raul Roco, another presidential candidate, agrees, saying\nthe bishops are entitled to air their opinions but  \" they must\nspecify the charges against each candidate so that the people will know what\nthey have against &rdquo;  them. \n\n \n\nSantiago said a good Christian voter must know who may be\nacceptable and why.\n\n\nVoters, she said, must be aware of a concern that is admittedly\nwidely practiced in domestic politics--turncoatism. \n\n \n\n \" Is it acceptable behavior for a candidate to\ndisregard completely any party affiliation or even worse, any ideological\nallegiance simply because he or she can grab the opportunity to be a\ncandidate with the party possessing the most resources? &rdquo; \nasked Santiago.  \n\n\n\n\n  3 of 10 Cuneta memos forged  \n\n\n Lenie Lectura and Joel San Juan \n\n \n\nSO, who forged the signature of Pasay City Mayor Cuneta in the\nmemoranda he sent to city hall which said that he would be returning to his\noffice after a long absence? \n\n \n\nThis is the question the National Bureau of Investigation ( NBI)\nis now trying to answer after its findings revealed that the signature on\nthree of the ten memoranda was not Cuneta 's. \n\n \n\nA \" TODAY \" source disclosed that the NBI\nanti-graft and corruption team led by lawyer Rickson Chiong released Friday\nnight its finding on the authenticity of the signatures of three memoranda\nallegedly signed by Cuneta. \n\n \n\nThe source said two of those memoranda were the ones dated\nDecember 15 and 16, 1997. \n\n \n\n \" The signature of the original specimen in the\nquestioned documents appear not to be made by the same person, &rdquo;\n the two-page findings read. \n\n \n\nThe source added that the persons whose signatures appeared in\nthe forged memoranda will also be investigated by the NBI as to the extent of\ntheir participation in the fraud. \n\n \n\n \" Those who attested will also be investigated,\n&rdquo;  the source said. \n\n \n\nCuneta 's wife Elaine and acting City Administrator Lourdes\nCabrido were among those who attested to the authenticity of the memoranda.\n\n\n \n\nThe source added that the NBI findings will be presented to the\ncity council on Tuesday. \n\n \n\nTrinidad, who earlier took his oath of office as the new mayor of\nPasay City, originally submitted 10 memoranda allegedly signed by Cuneta to\nthe NBI to verify if Cuneta was indeed the one who signed them. \n\n \n\n \" These memoranda are of dubious origin.\n\n\n[ The signatures on them] are different from the signatures of Mayor\nCuneta, &rdquo;  he alleged. \n\n \n\nTrinidad said Cuneta 's inability to move about freely without\nhelp or even to hear clearly made him doubt the authenticity of the\nsignatures. \n\n \n\nThe vice-mayor elect also said that he has the support of the\ncity council, whose members had passed Resolution 985 S-1997, asking Cuneta\nto present proof that he is physically capable to assume office again. \n\n \n\nTrinidad, likewise challenged Cuneta to attend a press conference\nso that every one may be free to judge if he is still lucid. \n\n \n\nCuneta, who celebrates his 88th birthday today, is again expected\nto appear at the city hall today. \n\n \n\nThe Department of the Interior and Local Government has been\nunable to enforce its position that Cuneta should sit as Pasay City mayor.\n \n\n\n\n\n  Opposition against NAIA 3 gathers steam  \n\n \n\nTHE resistance to the construction of the Ninoy Aquino\nInternational Airport ( NAIA) Terminal 3 yesterday gained more advocates\nafter six groups in Pasay City registered their support to oppose the\nproject. \n\n \n\nLawyer Nonoy Hilvano, founding chairman and president of Justice\nfor All Movement of the Philippines ( JAMP), said the six groups have been\nmeeting with his group in a bid to consolidate forces to take issue against\nthe project. \n\n \n\nHilvano identified the six groups from Pasay as  Bangon\n Pasay Movement ( BPM), Join Our Crusade for Progress ( JOC for\nProgress),  Kapitkamay  Neighborhood Association ( KNA),\nLuna-Harrison-Pier Drivers Association, Inc. ( LUHAPDA), residents of \nBarangay  Electrical Road and  Barangay  Pildera 2.\n\n\n \n\n \" These groups have joined us in our struggle\nagainst NAIA 3, &rdquo;  he said. \n\n \n\nBased on a report from an expert 's analysis, Hilvano said that\nNAIA with only one runway is not capable of accommodating the New Large\nAircraft ( NLA) due to its already optimum runway length and marginal\nwingspan clearance. \n\n \n\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO) prescribes that\nfor airplanes with wingspan of more than 52 meters, runway-taxiway separation\ndistance should at least be 182.5 meter for safety considerations. \n\n \n\nAlready, today 's model like B-747 400 series has a wingspan of\n65 meters. \n\n \n\nAccording to the same report, the runway-taxiway separation\ndistance for NAIA is only 150 meters.\n\n\nThis system does not meet ICAO specifications and therefore is\nconsidered as  \" impairment of safe aircraft operations. &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\n \" Why government is adamant on maintaining NAIA in\nPasay City as the country 's premier international airport when it cannot be\nsustainable, &rdquo;  Hilvano said,  \" is stupidity of\nthe highest degree. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nJAMP insists that there are other alternative uses for NAIA that\ncan better benefit the people of Pasay. \n\n \n\nWithin the NAIA area alone, conservative estimates show that\nthere are about 32,000 households in 18 squatter colonies occupying NAIA\nlands falling within the MIAA jurisdiction.\n\n\nBiggest among these is the Balagbag, Merville area with 8,000\nfamilies. \n\n \n\nWorse, about 3,000 of them are occupying highly dangerous zones\nlike creeks and canals. \n\n \n\nSo, according to Hilvano, with NAIA being converted for\ncommercial and light industrial uses and providing for an on-site socialized\nmass housing, the social and economic benefits not only to the people of\nPasay will be enormous.  \n\n\n\n\n  Palace hand in Nova drive  \n\n \n\nA MOTORCADE in Quezon City yesterday gave strong hints that\nMalaca&ntilde;ang is not exactly a disinterested observer in Novaliches '\nquest to become a city. \n\n \n\nThe motorcade, which started in SM Fairview and wound up at\nNovaliches  Bayan  , was spearheaded by the United Novaliches\nfor Program Movement ( UNFPM), a group closely identified with the \n\" JEEP ni Erap &rdquo;  organization. \n\n \n\nThe UNFPM is headed by Larry Grajeda, UNFPM president,\nreportedly President Estrada 's choice as acting mayor once Novaliches wins\ncityhood. \n\n \n\nIt is the President who will appoint the new city 's officer in\ncharge if the \" yes &rdquo; vote prevails in the plebiscite this\nSaturday. \n\n \n\nGrajeda is the public information officer of the defunct\nPresidential Anti-Crime Commission ( PACC) under then Vice-President Estrada.\n\n\n \n\n \" Let us ( Quezon City residents) support the\nNovaliches cityhood.\n\n\nThis is all we need to achieve our dream, a real development,\n&rdquo;  Grajeda said yesterday. \n\n \n\nHe appealed to Quezon City Mayor Mel Mathay, Jr., Congressman\nDante Liban and other city officials to support the plebiscite and not to\ntaint it with politics. \n\n \n\n\" I am against any political agenda, especially the\nold-dirty politics, in the Novaliches cityhood.\n\n\nThis is not a fight between politicians but a battle for a\nNovaliches ' future, &rdquo;  he said. \n\n \n\nHe said he would not hesitate if President Estrada appoints him\nas the first acting mayor of Novaliches. \n\n \n\n \" I will respect any decision of President\nEstrada.\n\n\nBut it 's too early to talk who will be the mayor; the most\nimportant thing now is the victory of Novaliches ' cityhood, &rdquo; \nGrajeda said. \n\n \n\nNovaliches Cityhood Movement president Cesar Roque, who also\njoined the motorcade, said he was not targeting any Quezon City official when\nhe exposed the alleged attempts to bribe  barangay  officials\nto campaign against cityhood. \n\n \n\nRoque said he just heard the information about the alleged\nbribery from a  barangay  official and some Novaliches\nresidents and he was not sure whether the information was true or not. \n\n \n\nHe said his group does not believe in resorting to dirty\ntactics, and that he believes that Mathay would never tolerate, much more\nuse, dirty tactics in the coming plebiscite. \n\n \n\nFormer Quezon City Vice Mayor Charito Planas has revealed that\nshe would vote \" yes &rdquo; in the plebiscite. \n\n \n\n \" Let us allow Novaliches to establish its\nindependence for it might be a way to its swift development and progress,\n&rdquo;  Planas said. \n\n \n\nFor the past 60 years, Planas admitted that Novaliches remained\nthe \" sleepy part &rdquo; of Quezon City despite having 15 \nbarangays  with a population of 187,000.\n\n\nShe said the Quezon City government could no longer provide even the\nbasic necessities of Novaliches. \n\n \n\n\" There was no progress and improvement in terms of\ninfrastructure because the area was far flung from the city proper,\" \nshe said. \n\n\nby JONATHAN FERNANDEZ and VERONICA TUAZON", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "75c322a6-bd0e-469e-a5ff-c26cddc630ca", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.293232+00:00"}

- a member of the PNP\nTraffic Management Group, an Air Force soldier, a member of the Philippine\nMarines and two security guards - - were arrested for firing their guns into\nthe air during the celebration. \n\n \n\nPresident Estrada himself warned that soldiers and policemen\ncaught firing their guns to greet the New Year would be dismissed. \n\n \n\nMeanwhile, civilians violating the ban would be charged in court,\naccording to authorities. \n\n \n\nThe DOH reported that 492 people were injured in the past 10 days\nnationwide, including 37 who needed amputations.\n\n\nMost of the injuries occurred on Thursday night and a vast majority\nof the injured were sent home after treatment, it said. \n\n \n\nThere were no deaths. \n\n \n\nAt least 14 people, including 10 in Manila, were injured in\ngunfire when people fired into the air to celebrate the advent of the new\nyear, authorities said, despite government appeals for people not to fire\ntheir guns. \n\n \n\nMost of the others were burned or sustained eye injuries from\nfirecrackers. \n\n \n\nFilipinos traditionally let off firecrackers at the stroke of\nmidnight on Dec. 31 - - and for some hours on either side - - to ward off\nevil spirits in the new year.\n\n\nBut each year hundreds of people are injured and some are killed in\naccidents. \n\n \n\nThursday night was little different.\n\n\nThe sky over Manila, a city of 12 million people, was ablaze at\nmidnight with rockets showering pockets of light into the air while there was\na cacophony of noise on the streets below. \n\n \n\nCar drivers, huddled in their seats as firecrackers burst around\ntheir vehicles, tooted their horns at midnight while people on balconies\nshowered coins on the revellers below and beat on the railings. \n\n \n\nBut this year the noise all but died out half an hour into the\nyear. \n\n \n\n \" Usually there 's noise until two or three in the\nmorning, &rdquo;  said a security guard outside a bar in Makati, the\nfinancial heart of the capital, as the lingering smoke from the firecrackers\nslowly began to lift.\n\n\n \" It 's much quieter now. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nOthers said the economic crisis in the country had led to less\nfervent celebrations - - and a corresponding decline in the severity of\naccidents. \n\n \n\n \" There are many factors that caused this decline,\namong them is the economic situation, &rdquo;  Romualdez told\nreporters.\n\n\n \" Injuries are less severe this year, which really\nmeans that people are more careful. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nHowever, Romualdez conceded that the number of victims could rise\nas soon as all reports from all regions come in. \n\n \n\nOf the 14 victims of stray bullets, 10 came from Mindanao and the\nfour others from Metro Manila. \n\n \n\nBased on the partial reports, firecracker explosions and firing\nof guns decreased by 58 percent compared to 1997. \n\n \n\nThis was the first time that the country experienced a less\nexplosive New Year 's Eve celebration, which Filipinos usually observed in\nthe past with unabated explosion of firecrackers all over the land,\nparticularly in Metro Manila. \n\n \n\nAggravating the situation was the indiscriminate firing of guns\nby soldiers, policemen and civilian gun owners. \n\n \n\nWeeks before the Christian holidays, the government and\nnon-government organizations launched a massive campaign nationwide asking\ngunholders to refrain from firing their firearms to celebrate the incoming\nNew Year. \n\n \n\nThe drive also discouraged citizens from exploding firecrackers,\nparticularly the big ones which had caused injuries to thousands of victims\nthe previous years. \n\n \n\nThe PNP said that while the celebration of the New Year was not\ndevoid of gunfires and firecracker explosions, there was less in the 1999 New\nYear 's observance. \n\n \n\nAside from the government 's big success in convincing people not\nto fire their guns and explode firecrackers, another reason could be the\neconomic crisis the country has been experiencing the past 18 months. \n\n \n\nBut there were still those who were hard-headed who insisted on\nplaying with firecrackers and firing their guns. \n\n \n\nAs a result, one had his arm amputated when he picked and lit up\nan unlit fountain early dawn yesterday.\n\n\nThe fountain exploded in his hand. \n\n \n\nAll 16 major hospitals in Metro Manila reported a big decrease in\nthe number of victims of firecracker explosion and gunfire.  \n\n\n\n\n  House frowns on new taxes  \n\n\n Tita C. Valderama \n\n \n\nTHE HOUSE leadership is not keen on giving priority to any tax\nmeasure in the first six months of the new year, according to acting Speaker\nEduardo Gullas. \n\n \n\n \" We will give due importance first to reforms in\nthe power sector, banking, grains importation, environment and securities\nmarket before any revenue measure is taken up, &rdquo;  said Gullas.\n\n\n \n\nSpeaker Manuel Villar, who is on a month-long annual family\nvacation in the United States, has designated Gullas, the senior deputy\nspeaker, as acting Speaker. \n\n \n\nIt was Gullas who represented Villar in the signing of the\n&peso;579.5 billion national government budget for this year in\nMalaca&ntilde;ang on Dec. 30. \n\n \n\nAccording to Gullas, Villar has specified the House priorities\nthis year in various meetings with chamber 's leadership before the end of\n1998. \n\n \n\nReforms in the power sector, Gullas said, will be highlighted by\nthe approval of the Omnibus Power Bill which restructures the electric power\nindustry through the privatization of the National Power Corp. to allow\nprivate entities to engage in power generation, transmission and\ndistribution. \n\n \n\nThe Committee on Energy, chaired by Camarines Sur Rep. Arnulfo\nFuentebella, has consolidated several bills related to the power sector\nrestructuring into House Bill 4579. \n\n \n\nAt present, power generation is undertaken by the Napocor,\nindependent power producers and self-generators.\n\n\nPower transmission, on the other hand, is centralized and vested in\nthe Napocor while electric distribution is fragmented with over 130\nfacilities consisting of private utilities, municipal utilities and electric\ncooperatives, mostly small and uneconomic. \n\n \n\nNapocor 's huge debt, roughly &peso;500 billion, and the highly\ncapital-intensive character of the power industry have been considered\ncritical constraints to the expansion of the industry.\n\n\nData from Napocor show that the demand for electricity is expected to\nincrease by 58 percent annually over the next 10 years. \n\n \n\nThis will require government to raise at least &dollar;1 billion\na year or &dollar;10 billion over 10 years to meet this growing demand. \n\n \n\nAware of the government 's limited resources, legislative and\nexecutive officials of the previous administration arrived at a decision to\nencourage private capital into the power sector by opening up the industry\nthrough restructuring and privatization instead of squeezing scarce\ngovernment funds or raising power rates to generate the needed amount for\nexpansion projects. \n\n \n\nIn the banking sector, Gullas said several bills seeking to\nstrengthen the financial system against problems similar to those associated\nwith the currency turmoil last year will be consolidated. \n\n \n\nThis will have to be rushed considering that the Committee on\nBanks and Financial Intermediaries was just organized in early December, with\nBatangas Rep. Jose Macario Laurel IV as chairman. \n\n \n\nOne of the reforms in grains importation is to open up the\nauthority to import rice and corn in order to lessen the burden of the\nNational Food Authority, Gullas said. \n\n \n\nThe Clean Air Act will also be a priority among the many\nenvironment bills pending in the House. \n\n \n\nGullas said the controversial provision on incinerator, which\nhampered its approval in the previous Congress, had been deleted to hasten\nthe measure 's enactment. \n\n \n\nTax bills, including the amnesty and census of taxpayers, soft\ndrinks tax and road users ' or motor vehicle tax, will have to wait until the\nsecond regular session in July, Gullas said. \n\n \n\n \" The leadership has agreed on this, that the tax\nbills will not be prioritized in the first half of the year, &rdquo; \nhe said.  \n\n\n\n\n  More MILF rebels noted  \n\n\n Ben Cal \n\n \n\nTHE SEPARATIST  Moro  Islamic Liberation Front\ncontinued to buildup its forces, recruiting 3,790 fighters during the past\nthree years, a military yearend report said. \n\n \n\nThe report said the MILF under Hashim Salamat has now a total of\n11,990 guerrillas as of the end of 1998, compared to the 8,200 in 1996. \n\n \n\nIn 1997, the MILF added 1,130 recruits to its forces in Southern\nPhilippines, mostly in Central Mindanao where the MILF has established its\nheadquarters at Camp Abubakar. \n\n \n\nAt the same time, the military said the MILF also acquired\nadditional firepower.\n\n\nThe military estimates that the MILF has a total of 8,240 assorted\nfirearms, up by 1,275 from the 6,965 in 1996.\n\n\nIn 1997, the MILF had some 8,200 firearms of various calibers. \n\n \n\nThe build-up of firepower and recruitment activities occurred\nwhile a ceasefire agreement between the government and the MILF is in place,\nthe military said. \n\n \n\nHowever, it noted that gun battles between the government and the\nMILF had gone down a bit from 369 in 1997 to 293 in 1998.\n\n\nThis was attributed to the existing truce in effect. \n\n \n\nArmed encounters initiated by the MILF in 1998 were recorded at\n185 compared to 222 in 1997.\n\n\nOn the other hand, government forces initiated 108 attacks against\nMILF, down from the 147 AFP-initiated in 1997. \n\n \n\nAs a result of the ceasefire, fatalities from both sides had\ndecreased drastically since 1996. \n\n \n\nThe military said that 33 government troops died from clashes\nwith the MILF in 1998, compared to 51 in 1997.\n\n\nIn 1996, the government suffered 104 dead.\n\n\nThe fatalities on the government side included military personnel,\npolicemen and a Cafgu paramilitary unit. \n\n \n\nMILF fatalities also went down from 168 in 1996 to 80 in 1998.\n\n\nIn 1997, the MILF suffered 165 dead. \n\n \n\nA total of 690 MILF surrendered the past three years with the\nbiggest at 405 surrenders in 1997, followed by 278 in 1996 and 207 in 1998,\nthe military report said. \n\n \n\nCaptured MILF rebels in 1998 were placed only at seven.\n\n\nIn 1997 and 1996, there were 24 and 0 MILF rebels who surrendered,\nrespectively. \n\n \n\nIn firearms exchange, the military had the upperhand.\n\n\nThe AFP captured 60 firearms in 1998 and lost only 14, or a net gain\nof 46 firearms in favor of the government.\n\n\nIn 1997, government forces recovered 13 firearms and lost only 17 to\nMILF rebels.\n\n\nIn 1996, the AFP seized 91 firearms and lost 52, or a net gain of\n39.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "4c611e9a-e1cf-4734-a346-babbe9655f59", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.294615+00:00"}
{"text": "'Mobile teachers' project  \n\n\n  Aim is to reach far-flung areas  \n\n \n\nSTARTING this year, \" mobile teachers &rdquo; will be\ndeployed by the government in far-flung areas to teach the young with the\nbasics of reading, writing and arithmetic. \n\n \n\nEducation, Culture and Sports Undersecretary Victor Andres Manhit\nsaid they are now recruiting 300 teachers under the \" \" Mobile\nLiteracy Project &rdquo; \" to participate in the program. \n\n \n\nThese teachers are to render 40 hours of service weekly to people\nin remote barrios, upland dwellings, indigenous communities and even\nrebel-infested areas, Manhit said in a report to Malaca&ntilde;ang. \n\n \n\nInitially, he added, the project will cover areas in Palawan and\nthe Cordillera Administrative Region, particularly Apayao, Ifugao and Abra.\n\n\n \n\nManhit said beneficiaries of this non-formal education program\nwill be out-of-school youths aged 15 and above. \n\n \n\nMobile teachers with handy instructional aids will visit Palawan,\nCAR and other isolated places to gather clientele and teach them the \"\nbasics &rdquo; of reading, writing and computation as well as livelihood\nlessons. \n\n \n\nManhit said the mobile teachers will hold sessions among residents\neven if there are established elementary schools nearby. \n\n \n\nWith the start of this DECS project he said that mountain folks,\nindigenous people, OSYs  and adults need\nnot travel far to go to schools nor wait for the establishment of schools in\ntheir far-flung communities. \n\n \n\nThrough their roving teachers, the DECS will bring education to\npeople residing in remote and inaccessible areas in the country, he said.\n\n\n \n\nThis DECS project is in step, said Manhit, with the commitment of\nPresident Estrada to address the problem of thousands of residents in the\nfaraway areas who have dropped out of school or have not even attended formal\neducation due to lack of schools, unstable peace and order condition, and the\nneed for children to help their parents till their farms. \n\n \n\nManhit said the Estrada administration has put a premium on human\nresource development because the President believes this is the most potent\nway for government to sharpen the country 's competitiveness in the face of\nthe rising Knowledge or Information Society. \n\n \n\nMr. Estrada has also thrown his full support behind a DECS\nprogram to provide pre-school services to indigent kids in depressed\ncommunities so they could be at par, he said, with their rich counterparts\nwho enjoy a head start by enrolling in kindergarten schools before entering\nGrade One.  \n\n\n\n\n  Estrada firm on graft drive  \n\n \n\nPRESIDENT Estrada served notice yesterday that he would pursue to\nthe hilt this year his campaign promise to rid the government of misfits and\nthe corrupt. \n\n \n\nAccording to the president, the firing of ranking officials\nlinked to irregularities last year should serve as a warning to others not to\ntest his resolve in cleansing the bureaucracy of graft and corruption. \n\n \n\nIn the first edition of his weekly program \" \n\" Jeep ni Erap: Ang Pasada ng Pangulo, &rdquo;  \" Mr.\nEstrada said:\n\n \n\n  \" Hihigpitan natin talaga itong graft and\ncorruption kaya palagay ko marami na tayong tinanggal na malalaking nasa\npuwesto kaya siguro mag-iingat na itong mga ibang ito.  ( We 'll\ntighten the screws on graft and corruption this year.\n\n\nI have removed several high-ranking officials linked to graft, so\nthis year should serve as a warning to our public servants.) &rdquo; \n\n\n \n\nThe program is aired nationwide over DZMM, the Bureau of\nBroadcast Services-  Radyo ng Bayan  , the  Sarimanok\n News Network, and the People 's Television Network Inc. ( PTV-4).\n\n\n \n\nThe President pointed out that since he assumed office last year,\nhe has made it clear that his administration will not tolerate graft and\ncorruption in any form. \n\n \n\nHe cited an executive order decreeing all contracts involving\n&peso;50 million and above should undergo the approval of the Office of the\nPresident, as one way to check against irregularities in government projects.\n\n\n \n\n  \" Naniniwala ako ang taong ito malaki ang\nmaibabawas sa graft and corruption at pinag-iingatan natin ang mga biddings.\n\n\nMayroon akong executive order above &peso;50 million ang bidding\nkailangan isasangguni muna sa Office of the President, hindi maaaring\nsila-sila lang, kailangan maaprubahan namin.  ( I believe we can do\nmuch against graft and corruption this year.\n\n\nFor instance, I have an executive order which subjects bidding of\ncontracts above &peso;50 million to a review by my office), &rdquo; \nhe said. \n\n \n\nBudget Secretary Benjamin Diokno, who guested on the program,\nsaid Malaca&ntilde;ang now coordinates more closely with the National Bureau\nof Investigation to foil any attempt at forging the President 's signature to\ncorner multimillion-peso contracts. \n\n \n\nDiokno said security measures are now in place to thwart such\nattempts, as shown by the recent arrest of two forgers who tried to pull off\nlast year one caper involving a &peso;450 million contract. \n\n \n\n \" I 'm telling everybody  hindi gannon\nkadali magpalusot . ..\n\n\nMarami kaming security features na di na namin sasabihin  (\nIt 's not easy to get through these measures, we have security features that\nI cannot divulge), &rdquo;  he said. \n\n \n\nDiokno said there were already earlier attempts under previous\nadministrations to pull off forgeries of the President 's signature, but only\nPresident Estrada acted to stop this illegal activity. \n\n \n\n \" In previous administrations,  nagpapalusot\ndin, ang ginagawa lang, ini-ignore.\n\n\nKami lang ang talagang nagpapahuli  ( there were attempts at\nforgery, but they just ignore these.\n\n\nOnly this administration ordered the arrest of those responsible).\n\n\nThat 's a lesson, &rdquo;  Diokno said. \n\n \n\nFor his part, Angelito Banayo, general manager of the Philippine\nTourism Authority and a presidential assistant on political affairs, said Mr.\nEstrada will exercise stronger political will this year in attaining his\nadministration 's thrusts. \n\n \n\nBanayo said the President is determined to fulfill his covenant\nwith the masses because it was the masses who elected him into office in the\nlast May presidential elections. \n\n \n\n  \" Kaya ang mga programa niya, food\nsecurity, agriculture, peace and order, at napamalas, ito naman ang\nnapakahalaga . ...yung tinatawag natin na political will sa pagsugpo ng mga\nsuliranin ng ating bansa  ( You see he exercised political will for\nhis programs in food, security, agriculture, and peace and order), &rdquo;\n he said. \n\n \n\nBanayo cited the administration 's achievement in stopping\nsyndicated crimes in its first six months, and in nipping graft and\ncorruption by firing high-ranking officials involved in irregularities. \n\n \n\n  \" Gaya ng nasabi niya kanina, di\nnagdadalawang-isip e.\n\n\nMay konting pagkakamali, konting iskandalo konti, tanggal sa opisina.\n\n\nIto po ay di naipamalas ng nakaraang administration na kasingbilis na\nipinamalas na political will ni President Estrada  ( Like the\nPresident said, he does not think twice about firing abusive or corrupt\nofficials.\n\n\nJust a little mistake, a minor scandal, and he removes these erring\nofficials from office.\n\n\nThis was not done in previous administrations, unlike President\nEstrada, who had the political will to do it), &rdquo;  he said. \n\n \n\nEven in the peace process and the country 's latest dispute with\nChina over the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, Mr. Estrada showed\ndecisiveness and astute political leadership, Banayo said. \n\n \n\nHe said this became evident in the President 's action regarding\nthe Philippines ' territorial dispute with China over the Spratly islands,\nand his rejection on the demand of the  Moro  Islamic\nLiberation Front on the establishment of a separate Muslim state in Mindanao.\n\n\n \n\n  \" So kita natin dito na may determination\nang political leadership, di nag-compromise di po padala-dalawang isip kundi\nsadyang buo ang loob sa pagharap sa suliranin ng ating bansa  ( The\nPresident showed his political leadership and did not dilly-dally on issues\nconcerning the country), &rdquo;  Banayo said.  \n\n\n\n\n  Erap bares &peso;3 cut in price of refined sugar \n\n\n \n\nPRESIDENT Estrada ordered yesterday a &peso;3 cut in the selling\nprice of refined sugar being sold by the National Food Authority ( NFA) to\ncushion the impact of rising cost of living due to a series of oil price\nincreases. \n\n \n\nIn line with the President 's directive, NFA administrator Edno\nJoson said retail price of sugar will now be &peso;21 per kilogram to\nconsumers, compared to the previous price of &peso;24. \n\n \n\nThe NFA also on orders of the President slashed the retail price\nof NFA rice by &peso;2 per kilo beginning Oct. 2.\n\n\nEach kilo of NFA rice is now retailed at &peso;12.60. \n\n \n\nJoson said the low-priced sugar will be available at the Enhanced\nRetail Access for the Poor ( ERAP)  sari-sari  stores, \nTinda  vans or rolling stores,  Palengke ng Bayan  and\nother selling outlets such as supermarkets, food chain outlets and\nconvenience stores nationwide. \n\n \n\nTo make the cheap sugar accessible to the average consumers,\nJoson said the NFA has started re-packing sugar in one or two kg plastic\ncontainers bearing the NFA logo and  \" Erap para sa Mahirap\n&rdquo;

\nJoson said. \n\n \n\nBut in the case of government and private institutions such as\nhospitals, military establishments, schools and cooperatives, Joson said, the\nsale will be at the end consumer price of &peso;21 per kg. \n\n \n\nFor industrial consumers, the selling price will be at\n&peso;19.50 per kg in 50 kg ex-warehouse bags. \n\n \n\nAmong the industrial users allowed to buy NFA sugar are bakeries,\npharmaceutical companies, food processors and exporters, cottage industries\ninvolved in food processing and soft drinks and ice cream manufacturers. \n\n \n\nJoson pointed out that as of first week of October, the NFA has\nin its possession an inventory of 2.4 million bags of 50 kg refined sugar.\n\n\n \n\nCurrent sales in NFA refined sugar was recorded at 979,301 kg\nwith the National Capital Region and Southern Tagalog posting the bulk of\nsales at 642,849 kg and 136,404 kg each, respectively.  \n\n\n\n\n  Speaker urges review of liberalization policies \n\n\n \n\nWHILE stressing his commitment to the policy of liberalization,\nSpeaker Manny B. Villar said the country has to  \" take it slow\n&rdquo;  and ensure that ample safety nets are provided to local\nindustries to ensure their survival. \n\n \n\npeaking at the Second International Conference of the\nMetropolitan Bank and Trust Co., Villar said he is prepared to call for a\n \" critical pause &rdquo;  to allow a careful review of\nliberalization strategies in the country. \n\n \n\n \" This policy has profited some while crippling\nothers who never deserved it, &rdquo;  said Villar. \n\n \n\nThe House of Representatives, he said, has passed a number of\nsafety net measures to help domestic industries cope with the wave of\nliberalization. \n\n \n\nThe Countervailing and Anti-Dumping Duties Acts, which were\npassed into law during the 11th Congress, he said,  \" will be a\nbig help to local companies &rdquo;  and hopefully will give them\nmore time to be truly competitive. \n\n \n\nHe pointed out that while he believes in the  \"\nfundamental sense and efficacy &rdquo;  of liberalization, its costs\nand benefits to the people have to be carefully assessed. \n\n \n\n\" It is still the best way forward to improving our economy\nand to integrating ourselves more fully with the world economy at large,\n&rdquo;  he said. \n\n \n\nTo cushion its negative effects, however, Villar said the House\nwill continue to work closely with the Executive branch to ensure that local\nindustries will be able to weather the transition period by instituting the\nneeded safety nets through legislation. \n\n \n\n \" Our immediate goal is to ensure the survival of\ndomestic industries and institute measures to encourage their continued\ngrowth and development, &rdquo;  he said. \n\n\n\n\n  Validators to check Y2K compliance  \n\n \n\nTHE Y2K Commission will verify the reports of companies and\ngovernment agencies on their Y2K compliance through independent or\nthird-party corporate validators. \n\n \n\nCommission chairman Amable Aguiluz V said the validation process\nis meant to make sure computer systems ( hardware and software) in\npre-identified seven critical sectors will function normally on Jan. 1. \n\n \n\nIt will also address residual problems, if any are found, by the\nvalidators before the computer problem strikes. \n\n \n\nThe commission has registered a total of nine third-party\nvalidators.\n\n\nAll of them have foreign track records and are either multinationals\nor are affiliated with multinationals.\n\n\nOther interested validators may still be recognized by the\ncommission. \n\n \n\nOnce registered, a corporate validator can offer its services to\nthe 391 companies and government agencies listed by the commission as very\ncritical in terms of Y2K compliance.\n\n\nThe companies or government agencies will pay the validators. \n\n \n\n \" Our job here is to make sure all the validators\nare competent.\n\n\nAnd as an added safeguard, we are requiring them to formally certify\nthe compliance of their client, &rdquo;  Aguiluz said. \n\n \n\nAguiluz said having independent and competent validators is a\nmust to flush out false reports if any before Jan. 1. \n\n \n\n \" By requiring the validators to certify, we are in\neffect employing checks and balances in verifying the submitted compliance\nreports.\n\n\nWe must be sure about the veracity of these reports so that we can\nmake last-minute remediation if needed, &rdquo;  he said. \n\n \n\nThe government has also worked out contingency plans in case\nunforeseen difficulties arise at the turn of the century. \n\n \n\nAguiluz said he is not taking chances with the Y2K problem\nbecause  \" it is full of uncertainties being a one-time problem.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThe banking and financial sector, he said, is the most ready.\n\n\nBanks have made back-up copies of their records.\n\n\nThe power sector has more than enough capacity that if an outage were\nto occur, it would last for only 10 minutes, he said. \n\n \n\nIn all, Aguiluz said he sees only inconvenience and not major\ndisruptions of business and daily life if the remediation of the critical\nsectors proved short of ideal.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "143c7e40-8e0d-430c-bfdd-fca706280cc5", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.295997+00:00"}

{"text": "The Uniqueness of Ateneo Education  \n\n \n\nLife at the Ateneo is a journey of discovery: of one 's self, of\nothers in the world, of God.\n\n\nUltimately, it is a journey into God 's light, and a discovery of how\nthis light can be shared uniquely with the world.\n\n\nWhat one gains in his or her unique journey at the Ateneo becomes an\nintegral part of one 's person forever.\n\n\nThe journey ends in a realization that the mission to be \n Lux in Domino   , God 's light in the world, to keep the\nlight burning brightly through generations, is the Ateneo way. \n\n \n\n  Cura personalis   - - care for the\nindividual person - - has always been a guiding principle of Jesuit education\nsince the time of St. Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Society of Jesus.\n\n\nIt makes possible the kind of superior instruction that makes rigorous\ndemands on students while attending to individual characteristics, learning\npatterns, and needs. \n\n \n\nIn this spirit, the programs stress student-centered learning, in\nwhich teaching and training extend beyond the classroom, and the acquisition\nof knowledge and skills is achieved through a true and reflective interaction\nwith the world.\n\n\nThis thrust encourages students to be proactive and to take\nresponsibility for their own learning and growth. \n\n \n\nThe  College  of the Loyola Schools seeks to develop in\nits students the basic liberal arts of thinking and of communicating thought,\nand to bring them into contact with all that is good in their distinctive\nFilipino heritage and the cultural heritage of the human race. \n\n \n\nAt the same time, the College introduces the students to fields\nof specialization in which they pursue with greater attention one particular\narea of knowledge suited to their individual talents and goals. \n\n \n\nThrough a program of truly co-curricular activities, it seeks,\nboth on and off campus, to make its students aware of the needs of the\nnation, especially of the underprivileged, and to help them recognize their\npotential power to transform Philippine society. \n\n \n\nThe College seeks to encourage its students to strive\ncourageously towards a more just and equitable world.\n\n\nIt thus seeks to couple the Jesuit educational objective of academic\nexcellence with a sense of service and justice demanded by our faith. \n\n \n\nThe  Graduate School  aims to impart in its students a\nhigh degree of competence in research or professional practice in one of the\nacademic disciplines.\n\n\nA special concern is the formation of educators who will contribute\nto excellence in the Philippine educational system and, thus, to the\nimprovement of Philippine society. \n\n \n\nIn the formation of educators and professionals, the Ateneo\nGraduate School prioritizes the need to mold  men and women for others\n . \n\n\n  Admission Info, Procedures, and Schedules  \n\n \n\n1.

Register for the  Ateneo College Entrance Test ( ACET)\n at the  Office of Admission and Aid  or at the \nProvincial Testing Center  . \n\n \n\nThe  Ateneo College Entrance Test  covers the areas\nof Mathematics, English, and general intelligence. \n\n \n\nApplicants presently residing abroad may submit the result of\ntheir  Scholastic Aptitude Test ( SAT)  taken this year or two\nyears ago in lieu of the ACET. \n\n\n  CRITERIA FOR ADMISSION  \n\n \n\nAdmission to the School of Arts and Sciences is open to qualified\nyoung men and women.\n\n\nAdmission is determined by the applicant 's fitness and preparation\nfor the college programs, ability to contribute toward the enrichment of the\nundergraduate school community, and potential to be of service to one 's\nfellowmen within the context of national development.\n\n\nThe Committee on Admission and Aid is responsible for selecting the\nnew members of the student body.\n\n\nIt bases its decisions principally on the results of the Ateneo\nCollege Entrance Test, on past academic performances, on the recommendations\nof teachers, and on information contained in the application form. \n\n \n\nA small number of transfer students is accepted into the College.\n\n\nCriterion for such admission is as above.\n\n\nIn addition, the applicant must have finished a year with at least 30\nacademic units in another university.\n\n\nDecisions on transfer applications are given in May.\n\n\nIf accepted, there is no guarantee as to the number of courses that\nwill be validated from the previous school.\n\n\nUsually only one-third of the courses taken in the previous school\nare credited at the Ateneo. \n\n\n  FOREIGN STUDENTS  \n\n \n\nNon-Filipino applicants must comply with immigration requirements\nof the Republic of the Philippines.\n\n\nPlease  INQUIRE IMMEDIATELY  at the Philippine\nConsulate/Embassy at the county of origin. \n\n\n  FOREIGN STUDENT/NON-RESIDENT FEE  \n\n \n\nThe Ateneo education aspires to produce men and women who will\nrender service to the country.\n\n\nThus, priority is given to students who have greater likelihood of\nhaving the Philippines as their base after graduation. \n\n \n\nAn annual fee of  Ph&peso; 25,000.00  is payable in\nthe first semester.\n\n\nThis is applicable to all  NON-RESIDENT STUDENTS  . \n\n \n\nIt is not applicable to special exchange students, non-degree\nstudents and students on audit.\n\n\nExemptions are also granted to missionaries and religious, Filipinos\nwho are children of Overseas Filipino Workers ( OFW) and returning Filipino\nexpatriates.\n\n\nFor residency, one must have had a minimum of three ( 3) years\nschooling in a local high school/college/university.\n\n\nA valid passport must also be presented. \n\n\n  Notice of Decisions  \n\n \n\nLetters of acceptance, non-acceptance or placement on the waiting\nlist will be sent to each Freshman applicant by January 2002.\n\n\nIf no letter is received by mid-March, please contact the Office of\nAdmission and Aid concerning the decision and subsequent instructions.\n\n\nDecisions on transfer applications will be released on the first week\nof May 2002.\n\n\nSTUDENTS WHO FAIL TO SUBMIT THEIR APPLICATION FORMS OR WHO SUBMIT\nINCOMPLETE FORMS BY MISSING OUT ON ONE OR MORE OF THE REQUIREMENTS SHOULD NOT\nEXPECT ANY DECISION. \n\n\n  Scholarship and Financial Aid Grants  \n\n \n\nFor four decades now, the Ateneo College Scholarship Program for\ndeserving but financially needy students continues to thrive - thanks to the\nmany generous benefactors who have extended much needed and appreciated help.\n\n\nFor school year 2000-01, 14% of the total college population enjoyed\na scholarship grant. \n\n \n\nApplicants for scholarship must fill out a Scholarship/Financial\nAid Questionnaire.\n\n\nThis form must be secured and submitted together with the Application\nfor Admission form.\n\n\nApplication for scholarship does not influence in any way the\ndecision concerning acceptance into the college.\n\n\nScholarship applicants, therefore, should not wait for the decision\non their application for admission before securing or submitting a\nscholarship application. \n\n \n\nScholarship applications not accompanied by required documents or\nwith incomplete information will not be processed.\n\n\nApplicants with sibling(s) currently enjoying or have enjoyed\nfinancial aid in the past are automatically WAIT-listed for scholarship.\n\n\nAn applicant whose family 's annual gross income exceeds\nPh&peso;750,000.00 is normally not given financial aid and, therefore, need\nnot apply. \n\n \n\nWith very limited scholarship slots each year, the Committee on\nScholarship makes its decision on each application after carefully examining\nthe results of the Ateneo College Entrance Test ( ACET) together with the\nacademic record of the applicant, the family 's finances and recommendations.\n\n\n\n  CRITERION FOR SELECTION  \n\n \n\nScholarship grantees are selected on the basis of:\n\n\na) financial need as clearly manifested in the Scholarship/Financial\nAid Questionnaire\n\n\nb) intellectual ability and proven consistent academic performance\n\n\nc) commitment to the service of community and potential for greater\nservice in the future \n\n\n  TYPES OF SCHOLARSHIP GRANT  \n\n \n\nFinancial aid takes

{"text": "THE UPCAT  \n\n\n  Admission into the University through the UPCAT \n\n\n \n\nIf you decide to take the UP College Admission Test ( UPCAT) on\nAugust 3 or 4, 2002, you will be one among many thousands who aspire to enter\nthe University of the Philippines.\n\n\n( Last year, there were over 67,000 examinees.) \n\n \n\nWhile your performance on the UPCAT is important, entrance to UP\ndepends on more than just your test scores.\n\n\nYour high school grades are also considered in computing your\nUniversity Predicted Grade ( UPG), the final criterion to qualify for the\nUniversity of the Philippines. \n\n\n  What is the UPG?  \n\n \n\nThe UPG is a combination of your weighted scores on the UPCAT\nsubtests in language proficiency, reading comprehension, mathematics and\nscience, and the weighted average of final grades in your first three years\nin high school.\n\n\nEach UP campus has its own UPG cut-off that may vary from year to\nyear. \n\n\n  Qualifying for a Campus  \n\n \n\nTo apply to take the UPCAT, choose two campuses from among 9 (\nBaguio, Cebu, Diliman, Iloilo, Los Ba&ntilde;os, Manila, Mindanao, Pampanga,\nand Tacloban) and indicate them in order of preference on the application\nform.\n\n\nAlso indicate two degree programs per campus on your UPCAT\napplication form and again rank them in order of preference.\n\n\nYour application will be processed according to your campus and\ncourse choices and in the order you specified. \n\n \n\nTo qualify for the campus of your choice, you must meet the UPG\ncut-off of that campus.\n\n\nFor instance, entry into the Diliman campus is the most competitive\nbecause it is chosen by most applicants (  i.e.  , over\n40,000 applicants have sought to enter UP Diliman over the past few years).\n\n\nThe UPG cut-off for Diliman is therefore the highest among the\ncampuses.\n\n\nIf you make it to the UPG cut-off of your first choice, you will no\nlonger be screened for your second choice of campus.\n\n\nIf you do not make the UPG cut-off of your first choice, you are\nautomatically screened for your second choice of campus. \n\n\n  Qualifying for a Program  \n\n \n\nOnce you qualify to enter a campus, the next step is to be\naccepted into one of the degree programs you chose.\n\n\nA screening procedure is followed for this purpose.\n\n\nSome programs have their own \" predictor &rdquo; ( \ne.g.  , the UPG and predicted grades in specific areas like math or\nscience).\n\n\nCampus qualifiers are ranked according to the degree program\npredictor.\n\n\nTop-ranking qualifiers are accepted according to the number of slots\navailable for that program. \n\n \n\nIf you make it to the quota for your first choice of course, you\nwill no longer be screened for your second choice.\n\n\nIf you don't make it to your first choice of degree program, you will\nundergo the same screening process for your second choice.\n\n\nIf you still do not make it, you will remain qualified for that\ncampus but must then find a degree program that can accommodate you.\n\n\nRemember, you are an UPCAT qualifier; you only need to find a program\nthat will accept you.\n\n\nThe campus Registrar 's Office will help you find that program.\n\n\nQualification into U.P. is therefore a matter of qualifying for a\ncampus. \n\n\n  What if I do not qualify for a campus?  \n\n \n\nIf you do not make it to either of your campus choices you have\nseveral options:\n\n\nFIRST: You can try other UP campuses if:\n\n\n1. your UPG is within their cut-off, and\n\n\n2. they still have available slots. \n\n \n\nPresent your Non-Qualifier 's Slip ( which will be sent to you in\nthe mail and which will indicate your UPG) to the Registrar 's Office of the\ncampus you want to enter.\n\n\nYou will be informed of their decision.\n\n\nThere is no guarantee of acceptance as each campus makes its own\ndecisions according to its own criteria. \n\n \n\nSECOND: If no other UP campus can accommodate you, you will have\nto enroll in a college or university other than the UP.\n\n\nAfter earning 33 academic units with a weighted average of 2.00 or\nbetter on the U.P. marking system, you may apply for transfer to a UP campus.\n\n\nAgain, each campus has its own rules on transfer and accepts only a\nlimited number of transfer students.\n\n\nInformation regarding transfer to UP may be obtained from the Office\nof the University Registrar at  any  of the U.P. campuses. \n\n\n  SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR UPCAT ELIGIBILITY  \n\n \n\nTo be eligible to take the UPCAT, you  must  meet\ncertain specific requirements. \n\n \n\nFIRST: You must belong to one of the categories listed below:\n\n\n1.

A member who is 60 years old and unemployed and has paid at\nleast 120 monthly contributions prior to the semester of retirement. \n\n \n\n2. A member who is 65 years old, whether employed or not.\n\n\nIf employed he should have paid 120 monthly contributions prior to the\nsemester of retirement, whether employed or not. \n\n\n  What are the types of retirement benefits?  \n\n \n\nThey are:\n\n\n1. the monthly pension, and\n\n\n2. the lump sum amount. \n\n \n\nThe monthly pension is a lifetime cash benefit paid to a retiree\nwho has paid at least 120 monthly contributions to the SSS prior to the\nsemester of retirement. \n\n \n\nThe lump sum amount is granted to a retiree who has not paid the\nrequired 120 monthly contributions. \n\n\n  How much monthly pension will a retiree receive? \n\n\n \n\nThe monthly pension will be the highest of:\n\n\n1. the sum of &peso;300 plus 20 per cent of the average monthly\nsalary credit plus two per cent of the average monthly salary credit for each\ncredited year of service in excess of 10 years; or\n\n\n2. 40 per cent of the average monthly salary credit; or\n\n\n3. &peso;1,200, provided, that the monthly pension is paid for not\nless than 60 months. \n\n \n\nThe lowest monthly pension is &peso;1,200 if the member has 120\nmonthly contributions; &peso;2,400 if he has at least 20 credited years of\nservice. \n\n \n\nA retiree has the option to receive his first 18 monthly pensions\nin lump sum discounted at a preferential rate of interest to be determined by\nthe SSS.\n\n\nThe option should be exercised upon filing of the first retirement\nclaim.\n\n\nOnly advance payments shall be discounted on the date of payment.\n\n\nThe dependents ' and 13th month pensions are excluded from the\n18-months lump sum pension. \n\n \n\nShould there be an increase in the monthly pension within the\n18-month period, the discounted interest rate will be applied. \n\n \n\nThe member will receive his monthly pension on the 19th month.\n\n\n \n\nThe advanced amount will be deducted from future pensions. \n\n\n  What happens when the retirement pensioner resumes\nemployment?

 \n\n \n\nYes.\n\n\nThe retirement benefit will be paid to the qualified member on the\nactual date of technical retirement provided that he submits the necessary\ndocuments six months before the actual date of retirement. \n\n\n  How much is the lump sum amount?  \n\n \n\nThe lump sum amount is equivalent to the total contributions paid\nby the member and his employer, plus interest. \n\n\n  Aside from the retirement benefit, what else can a retiree\nreceive?  \n\n \n\nThe retiree is entitled to a 13th month pension payable every\nDecember. \n\n \n\nHe and his dependents are also entitled to Medicare benefits\nunder the administration of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (\nPhilHealth). \n\n\n  Are the children of a retiree member entitled to the\ndependent 's pension?

Count 12 months backwards starting from the month immediately\nbefore the semester of sickness.\n\n\n3. Identify the six highest monthly salary credits within the\n12-month period.\n\n \n\n Monthly salary credit  means the compensation base for\ncontributions and benefits related to the total earnings for the month.\n\n\n( The maximum covered earnings or compensation increases by\n&peso;1,000 beginning at &peso;7,000 in 1994 and every January of each year\nthereafter until the maximum of &peso;12,000 is reached.) \n\n \n\nPlease refer to the following table:  \n\n\n4. Add the six highest monthly salary credits to get the total\nmonthly salary credit.\n\n\n5. Divide the total monthly salary credit by 180 days to get the\naverage daily salary credit.\n\n\n6. Multiply the average daily salary credit by 90 per cent to get the\ndaily sickness allowance.\n\n\n7. Multiply the daily sickness allowance by the approved number of\ndays to arrive at the amount of benefit due.\n\n \n\n For example  , let us say that an SSS member falls\nsick or gets injured in October 1998 for 20 days:\n\n\na. The semester of sickness would be from July 1998 to December\n1998.\n\n\nb. The 12-month period would be from July 1997 to June 1998 within\nwhich the six highest monthly salary credits will be chosen.\n\n\nc. Let us assume that the six highest monthly salary credits are\n&peso;11,000 each.\n\n\nThus, the total monthly salary credit is &peso;66,000 ( &peso;11,000\nx 6).\n\n\nd. The total monthly salary credit would be divided by 180 to get\nthe average daily salary credit or &peso;366.67 ( &peso;66,000/180).\n\n\ne. The daily sickness allowance is 90 per cent of the average daily\nsalary credit or &peso;330 ( &peso;366.67 x 0.9).\n\n\nThus, the daily sickness allowance for 1998 is &peso;330.\n\n\nThis amount was derived by determining the daily salary credit as\nfollows: &peso;11,000 ( maximum salary credit) x 6/180 = 366.67.\n\n\nNinety per cent of &peso;366.67 is &peso;330.\n\n\nf. The total sickness benefit is &peso;6,600 ( 330 x 20 days). \n\n\n  How many days in a year can a member avail himself of the\nsickness benefit?  \n\n \n\nA member can be granted sickness benefit for a maximum of 120\ndays in one calendar year.\n\n\nAny unused portion of the allowable 120 days sickness benefit cannot\nbe carried forward and added to the total number of allowable compensable\ndays in the subsequent year. \n\n \n\nThe sickness benefit shall not be paid for more than 240 days on\naccount of the same illness.\n\n\nIf the sickness or injury still persists after 240 days, the claim\nwill be considered a disability claim. \n\n\n  Who should an employee notify regarding his sickness or\ninjury?  \n\n \n\nA member should notify his employer within five calendar days\nafter the start of the sickness or injury.\n\n\nThe employer, in turn, has another five calendar days to notify the\nSSS.\n\n\nNotification to the employer is not necessary if an employed member 's\nconfinement is in a hospital or if he fell sick or was injured while working\nor was within the company premises.\n\n\nIn this case, the employer has to notify the SSS within five days of\nthe employee 's sickness or injury.\n\n\nThis is the rule on notification. \n\n\n  What is the procedure for notification for unemployed,\nself-employed and voluntary members?  \n\n \n\nIf a member is unemployed, a self-employed person or voluntarily\npaying, he should directly notify the SSS within five calendar days after the\nstart of confinement, unless such confinement is in a hospital in which case,\nnotification is not necessary. \n\n\n  What are the effects of failure or delay in notification?\n \n\n \n\n1. If the employee notifies his employer, or the SSS, in the\ncase of an unemployed member, self-employed or voluntarily paying member,\nbeyond the prescribed five-day period, the confinement shall be deemed to\nhave started not earlier than the fifth day immediately preceding the date of\nnotification. \n\n \n\n2. If the employer notifies the SSS beyond the five calendar\ndays after receipt of the notification from the employee, the employer shall\nbe reimbursed only for each day of confinement from the 10th calendar day\nimmediately preceding the date of notification to the SSS. \n\n \n\nIf the employee has given the required notification to his\nemployer, but the employer fails to notify the SSS within the prescribed\nperiod resulting in the reduction or denial by the SSS of the claim, the\nemployer shall have no right to recover the daily sickness allowance he paid\nto his employee.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "04884ef9-788d-4c55-b3cf-a497e4ff3e12", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.300679+00:00"}

In dealing with all the members of the university community,\nstudents are expected to observe the usual norms of politeness, etiquette,\nand courtesy.\n\n\nFaculty members, administrators, or staff members, in their\nobligation to exercise the judgment of good parents,  in loco\nparentis  , may call the attention of students who display\nunbecoming behavior in campus or during officially sanctioned University\nactivities outside campus. \n\n \n\n4.3. Students should follow the usual classroom policies and\nprocedures as well as those pre-set by the teacher.\n\n\nThe latter should have been communicated to and accepted by the\nstudents.\n\n\nStudents who violate the above may be sent out of class.\n\n\nSuch students must then report to the Director of Discipline.\n\n\nA student sent out of the class must carry a written note from the\nDirector of Discipline authorizing him/her to re-enter class at the next\nmeeting.\n\n\nStudents absent for reasons indicated here are to be marked \"\n\" Absent &rdquo; \" for all sessions missed.\n\n\nPersistent occurrences of this type of behavior render the student\nliable to being asked by the University Discipline Board to discontinue\nclasses, with a grade of 0.0 for that particular course. \n\n \n\n4.4.

It is considered unethical for any student to make any\nunfavorable remark towards another, including sexist remarks.\n\n\nAreas exclusively used by men/women which are marked accordingly (\nladies ' and men 's rooms) are off limits to the opposite sex. \n\n \n\n4.8. Healthy interaction with members of the opposite sex is\nencouraged by the University Administration.\n\n\nHowever, acts or gestures which tend to offend other members of the\ncommunity, including public display of physical intimacy, are not tolerated.\n\n\n \n\n4.9. The University encourages student use of campus facilities\nfor business meetings and for social, cultural and recreational activities.\n\n\nAt the same time, it also holds that it has a corresponding right to\ndeny the use of facilities to those who are unable or unwilling to abide by\nUniversity regulations. \n\n \n\n4.10. Students who invite guests from outside the campus ( e. g.\nlecturers, speakers, seminar participants) are requested to submit a visitors\nlist to the Office of the AVP for Administrative Services, indicating the\nnames of campus visitors, the purpose of their visit, and the expected time\nof their arrival.\n\n\nThis will be forwarded to the security-on-detail for proper\ninformation.\n\n\nGuests should be accorded the proper courtesy due their position or\nrank at all times. \n\n \n\n4.11. Any report of a student exhibiting unbecoming behavior\nautomatically brings about an inquiry by the Director of Discipline.\n\n\nSuch action may render a student liable to be discharged from the\nUniversity, upon investigation by the University Discipline Board.  \n\n\n4.11.1. Any student exhibiting behavior with indications of\npsychological imbalance may be referred to a counselor.\n\n\nThe counselor, after an initial assessment, may bring the case to the\nattention of the Guidance Director if the student is found to be a\nthreat/danger to himself/herself and others.\n\n\nThe Guidance Director in turn may convene a committee, whose members\nare appointed based on the circumstances surrounding the case, to evaluate\nand make recommendations to the Dean concerned on how the student can be\nhelped.\n\n\nThe Dean, upon relevant consultation, may make a decision on whether\nto allow the student to enroll or to go on leave.\n\n\nThis decision is final and executory. \n\n \n\n4.12.

Guidelines on Academic Honesty \n\n\n Preparation of Papers and Other Works: Plagiarism \n\n \n\nAll work submitted--homework assignments, papers,\nexaminations--is expected to be the student 's own work.\n\n\nStudents should always take great care to distinguish their own ideas\nand knowledge from information derived from sources.\n\n\nThe term \" \" sources &rdquo; \" includes not\nonly published primary and secondary material, but also information and\nopinions gained directly from other people.\n\n\nThe responsibility for learning the proper forms of citation lies\nwith the individual student.\n\n\nQuotations must be properly placed within quotation marks and must be\ncompletely acknowledged.\n\n\nWhenever ideas or facts are derived from a student 's reading and\nresearch, the sources must be indicated. \n\n \n\nA student who reiterates or draws on ideas or facts used in\nanother paper that he or she is writing, or has written, must cite that other\npaper as a source. \n\n \n\nA computer program written to satisfy a course requirement is,\nlike a paper, expected to be original work of the student submitting it.\n\n\nCopying a program from another student or any other source is a form\nof academic dishonesty, as is deriving a program substantially from the work\nof another. \n\n \n\nA student 's papers and other work are expected to be submitted\nto only one course.\n\n\nIf the same or similar work is to be submitted to any other course,\nthe prior written permission of the instructor must be obtained.\n\n\nIf the same or similar term, the prior written permission of all\ninstructors involved must be obtained. \n\n\n( Adopted from the Harvard University handbook through the INTERNET)\n\n \n\n4.16. The university recognizes the value of being genuinely\nconcerned for the environment.\n\n\nAll members of the University are encouraged to observe practices\nwhich put this value into action.  \n\n\n  Section 6: Attendance  \n\n \n\n6.1. Prompt and regular attendance in all classes is required of\nall students from the first meeting of every course. \n\n \n\n6.2. A student is considered absent from class if he/she is not\npresent within the first third fraction of the scheduled time but not to\nexceed thirty minutes. \n\n \n\nThus, a student is considered absent if he/she arrives after:\n\n\n20 minutes for a 60-minute class;\n\n\n30 minutes for a 90 to 180 minute class ( laboratory or lecture) \n\n \n\n6.3. A student is considered late or tardy and receives a\nhalf-absence if he arrives in class during the first third fraction of the\nscheduled class time,  i.e.  if he arrives within the time\nschedule described above.\n\n\nA half-absence may be added to another half-absence to make a full\nabsence recorded against a student. \n\n \n\n6.4. Although members of the faculty are expected to begin their\nclasses promptly, various contingencies which are sometimes unavoidable may\ncause some faculty members to be late for class.\n\n\nIn such cases, the following guidelines are to be observed: \n\n \n\n6.4.1. For 60-minute classes, students should not leave until\nafter 20 minutes; for 90 to 180-minute classes, students should wait 30\nminutes.\n\n\nStudents may be marked absent by a professor if they leave their\nclasses earlier than the prescribed time. \n\n \n\n6.5. Students render themselves ineligible for a passing grade in\na given subject for the trimester if they are absent from class for more than\ntwo and a half times the number of class meetings in a week, such as: more\nthan 12-1/2 times in a class meeting five times a week; more than 10 times\nfor a class meeting four times a week; more than 7-1/2 times for a class\nmeeting thrice a week; more than five times for a class meeting twice a week;\nmore than 2-1/2 for a class meeting once a week. \n\n \n\n6.6. Regulations regarding approved absences are as follows:\n\n \n\n6.6.1. An approved absence is one authorized through an Approved\nAbsence Form by the Dean of Student Affairs because the student concerned has\nofficially represented his/her duly accredited organization ( with the\nrecommendation of the Director of Student Activities) and/or the University (\nwith the recommendation of an Administrator) at some function or activity.\n\n\n \n\n6.6.2. Absences due to sickness, even if duly certified by a\ndoctor, parent, or guardian, are not considered approved absences and should\ntherefore be counted against the student 's attendance.\n\n\nHowever, a faculty member may give special consideration to a student\nwho has been absent due to sickness before giving him/her a grade of 0.0 in\ncases where the student, aside from showing great scholastic aptitude, has\nbeen consistently performing well.\n\n\nFor absences due to prolonged illness, a student, or his/her duly\nauthorized representative, must notify the Associate Dean as soon as\npossible. \n\n \n\n6.6.3. In case of an approved absence, the event is recorded in\nthe faculty class record, but such absence is not counted toward a student 's\n\" \" excess, &rdquo; \" as indicated in Section 6.5.\n\n\n \n\n6.7 A student is held responsible for all assignments and for the\nentire content of the course missed, regardless of the reason for his/her\nabsence. \n\n \n\n6.8. Students are not allowed to sit in a class unless they are\nenrolled ( for credit or audit) in the said class, are taking the course\nunder the College of Liberal Arts free elective program, or are allowed by\nthe teacher to stay inside the classroom. \n\n \n\n6.9. All honor students ( with a grade point average of 3.0 or\nabove in the preceding trimester) are given the privilege of unlimited cuts\nor absences in academic subjects ( except P.E. for students with ID number 91\nand below) but only upon presentation of a Certification for Unlimited Cuts\nto the instructor concerned.\n\n\nSuch certification may be obtained from the Registrar 's Office. \n\n \n\n6.9.1. Academic courses are those offered and taught by academic\ndepartments and, as such, are under the supervision of an academic dean. \n\n \n\n6.9.2. \" ORIENT \" , \" ROTC \" ,\nand \" typing \" are non-academic courses.\n\n\n\" P.E. \" is classified as a non-academic course for\nstudents with ID number 91 and below. \n\n \n\n6.10. Once a student accumulates half the number of absences\nwhich render one ineligible for a passing grade, the instructor normally\nwarns the student concerned and informs the student 's academic dean, who, in\nturn, summons the student and warns him.\n\n\nA list of students who have acquired such absences is usually posted\non the administrative bulletin boards.\n\n\nThis warning, however, is not a prerequisite for dropping the student 's\ncourse card once the number of maximum allowable absences is reached.\n\n\nIt is the student 's responsibility to keep a record of his/her\nabsences.\n\n\nHowever, he/she may verify such from his/her instructor. \n\n \n\n6.11.

{"text": "Land Transportation Office  \n\n\n  Plans and Programs  \n\n \n\nFor 2001, the following activities shall be undertaken to support\nand operationalize the strategies that have been laid down. \n\n\n1. Continuous implementation and monitoring of the following programs\nand projects which will enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of LTO\noperations.\n\n\n 1.1 LTO Information Technology Project \n\n \n\nThis project is being implemented under the BOO scheme.\n\n\nIt aims to provide an information highway enabling online transaction\nprocessing and allow the interconnection of all LTO District Offices and\nRegional Offices nationwide. \n\n \n\nNationwide rollout is scheduled January to June 2001.\n\n\nFull implementation is expected before the year ends. \n\n\n 1.2 Motor Vehicle Inspection and Emission Testing System (\nMVIETS) Project \n\n \n\nThe project involves the construction of an initial 124 MVIETS\ninspection lanes ( 29 for motorcycles and 95 for cars, trucks and buses) all\nover the country, especially for high motor vehicle density areas such as\nNCR, Metro Cebu, Metro Davao,  etc. \n\n\nThis aims to provide a safe and clean transportation environment\nthrough a mechanized system of motor vehicle inspection. \n\n \n\nThe submitted unsolicited proposal is now being reviewed by NEDA.\n\n\n\n 1.3 Motor Vehicle License Plate Plant \n\n \n\nThe project is planned to be implemented in a BOO scheme.\n\n\nAside from the provision of new plate making plants, the project\nshall also have support services to include computerization and communication\ncomponents to ensure that vehicle license plates are traceable and\nidentifiable in a real time basis. \n\n \n\nThe feasibility study for the project has been submitted to DOTC.\n\n\nOptions are now being studied on how the project will be implemented.\n\n\n\n 1.4 Manila Air Quality Improvement Program \n\n \n\nPursuant to pertinent provisions of RA 8749 otherwise known as\nPhil. Clean Air Act of 1999, the DOTC, through the LTO, shall enforce\ncompliance with the emission standards for motor vehicles.\n\n\nThe program aims for a comprehensive air pollution management and\ncontrol. \n\n \n\nThe Asian Development Bank ( ADB) has approved LTO 's request for\nthe acquisition of smoke emission testers to be installed in all LTO District\nOffices and for the acquisition of vehicles to be used in apprehending\nviolators. \n\n\n 1.5\n\n\nRoad Safety Project \n\n \n\nThe objective of this project is to protect the road users from\naccidents and other road hazards.\n\n\nAmong its activities are :\n\n\n a. Drug Testing Program \n\n \n\nUnder the law, LTO should not issue professional licenses to drug\naddicts or dependents.\n\n\nTo ensure enforcement of this law, the LTO, through BGC-99-001, shall\nrequire all applicants for professional driver license, whether new or\nrenewal, to undergo drug testing at the nearest accredited drug testing\ncenters effective 01 February 2001. \n\n\n b. Drivers Training Program \n\n \n\nThe system is intended to educate drivers on traffic rules and\nregulations as well as develop their proper skills and behavior in driving.\n\n\nThree hundred forty three ( 343) drivers from other government\nagencies have already attended the various seminars held last year. \n\n \n\nThis is a continuing project which we hope to expand this year to\ncover private and for hire vehicle drivers. \n\n\n c. Drivers Manual \n\n \n\nThe objective of this activity is to educate the Filipino drivers\non traffic rules and regulations as well as provide them motoring tips.\n\n\nMore copies of the manual shall be reproduced depending upon LTO 's\nbudget. \n\n\n d. Accreditation and Close Supervision of Driving Schools \n\n \n\nUpgrading of the standards in the accreditation of driving\nschools to ensure proper education of drivers is being done.\n\n\nFor this year, we are working on weeding out unfit driving schools to\nbenefit incoming student drivers. \n\n\n e. Outreach Program \n\n \n\nThis project entails visits to schools, bus companies, private\nand public organizations to conduct lectures on road safety.\n\n\nThis is a continuing undertaking of the Office in the promotion of\npublic awareness to transportation laws, rules and regulations. \n\n\n 1.6 MV Users Charge ( RA 8749) \n\n \n\nThis law has been passed to ensure that there are adequate funds\nfor the proper maintenance of all national and provincial roads.\n\n\nRegistration fee would now be called Motor Vehicle User Charge or\nMVUC.\n\n\nEffective date of implementation is 01 January 2001. \n\n \n\nThis is expected to raise LTO 's revenues in registration fees by\n25%. \n\n\n 1.7 Motor Vehicle Registration System ( MVRS) Project \n\n \n\nThis project will establish the history of every registered motor\nvehicle through the buildup of an MVRR database and its integration with the\ndatabases created in the preceding phases.\n\n\nAside from verification purposes, these databases will also serve as\nthe initial data for the LTO-IT Project. \n\n \n\nFor the year 2001, encoding of 2000 MVRRs shall be done.\n\n\nThe project will end once the LTO-IT Project is successfully\nimplemented nationwide. \n\n\n 1.8 Increase in Fees and Charges \n\n \n\nThis is a program to increase the revenue earning capacity of the\nOffice.\n\n\nLTO has already done a thorough study on the matter.\n\n\nThe proposal has been forwarded to DOTC for final review and\napproval. \n\n \n\nOnce implemented, this undertaking shall increase the Office'\nrevenues for license fees and fines and penalties on apprehensions by 70%.\n\n\n\n 1.9 Computer-based Management Information System ( MIS) \n\n \n\nThis system gathers, consolidates, compiles, presents and\nanalyzes statistical data of the different operations of the Office\nnationwide.\n\n\nIt is aimed to provide management with timely, accurate and reliable\ninformation for its policy formulation and decision making.\n\n\nThis is ongoing. \n\n\n 2.

Morales \n\n\n SGV & Co.  \n\n\n  Mandatory e-filing and e-payment  \n\n \n\nBeginning 2001, large taxpayers are mandated to e-file their\nfinal adjustment income tax returns.\n\n\nThey must also e-pay the taxes due through the EFPS on or before the\n15th day of the fourth month following the close of the taxable year. \n\n \n\nThis mandatory e-filing and e- payment shall continue for all\nfiscal years as well as the succeeding calendar years. \n\n \n\nNonetheless, e-payment is optional for tax returns that will be\nfiled until June 30, 2002.\n\n\nThus, for a large taxpayer who does not choose to pay electronically\nfor these returns, payment should be made manually. \n\n \n\nBeginning July 1, 2002, however, large taxpayers are mandated to\ne-file all tax returns that can be filed electronically and e-pay taxes due\nthrough the EFPS. \n\n \n\nPresently, only the following tax returns produced by the EFPS\ncan be filed electronically:\n\n\na) 1601C - Monthly Remittance Return of Income Tax Withheld on\nCompensation;\n\n\nb) 1601E - Monthly Remittance Return of Creditable Income Taxes\nWithheld ( Expanded);\n\n\nc) 1602 - Remittance Return of Final Taxes Withheld;\n\n\nd) 1603 - Remittance Return of Final Income Taxes Withheld on Fringe\nBenefits Paid to Employees other than Rank and File;\n\n\ne) 1700 - Annual Income Tax Return;\n\n\nf) 1702 - Annual Income Tax Return for Corporations and\nPartnerships;\n\n\ng) 1702Q - Quarterly Income Tax Return for Corporations and\nPartnerships;\n\n\nh) 2200A - Excise Tax Return for Alcohol Products;\n\n\ni) 2200P - Excise Tax Return for Petroleum Products;\n\n\nj) 2200T - Excise Tax Return for Tobacco Products;\n\n\nk) 2550M - Monthly Value-Added Tax Declaration;\n\n\nl) 2550Q - Quarterly Value-Added Tax Return; and\n\n\nm) 2551- Percentage Tax Return \n\n\n  Optional e-filing and e-payment  \n\n \n\nBeginning July 1, 2002, e-filing and e-payment shall be\nvoluntary for 200 non-large taxpayers identified by the BIR.\n\n\nThese non-large taxpayers may e-file not only their final adjustment\nincome tax returns but also all of the tax returns that can be filed\nelectronically. \n\n \n\nE-filing and e-payment are not yet available for everyone.\n\n\nNon-large taxpayers who are not among the 200 identified by the BIR\nmay not use the EFPS, at least until the appropriate regulations for this\ngroup are issued. \n\n \n\nThere is an exception to this rule.\n\n\nOfficials and employees of the BIR may e-file their returns and\ne-pay their taxes due through the EFPS upon the discretion of the\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue. \n\n \n\nFollowing the issuance of RR 2-2002, taxpayers who have\npreviously enrolled in the EFPS, have been delisted.\n\n\nAs such, these taxpayers, if qualified, would have to reenroll. \n\n \n\nLarge taxpayers and identified taxpayers that would like to use\nthe EFPS should enroll according to the provisions of applicable regulations,\ncirculars and orders, particularly Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 24-01\ndated May 8, 2002. \n\n \n\nAs of this writing, the BIR has not yet issued any new circular\nto implement the changes in the EFPS.\n\n\nIn the meantime, large taxpayers and identified taxpayers that would\nlike to use the EFPS should take note of the following changes in the\nprocedure for enrollment. \n\n \n\nThe officers required by law to file returns shall enroll\njuridical entities or artificial persons.\n\n\nThese officers are identified in RR 2-2002.\n\n\nFor domestic corporations, enrollment should be made by the\npresident, the vice president or other principa1 officers; for partnership,\nthe managing partner; for joint ventures, the managing head; and for resident\nforeign corporations, the country manager. \n\n \n\nA corporate taxpayer only has to submit secretary 's certificate\nidentifying the officers. \n\n\n  Penalties  \n\n \n\nLarge taxpayers face stiffer penalties if they fail to e-file\ntheir returns and e-pay their taxes.\n\n\nFailure to comply with the provisions of RR 2-2002 shall be\npenalized under Section 275 of the Tax Code of 1997. \n\n \n\nThus, a violation carries with it the penalty of imprisonment of\nnot more than six months or a fine of not more than &peso;1,000, or both.\n\n\n \n\nMoreover, only the first and second offenses may be compromised.\n\n\nFor the third and subsequent offenses, no compromise shall be\nentertained or allowed. \n\n \n\nLarge taxpayers and identified taxpayers that would like to use\nthe EFPS should take note of the deadlines in e-filing their returns and\ne-paying their taxes. \n\n \n\nThe recent amendment to the EFPS is first in a series of changes\nto be implemented by the BIR to completely computerize taxpayers '\ntransactions. \n\n \n\nFor sure, there will be subsequent regulations making e-filing\nand e-payment mandatory for other taxpayers.\n\n\nEventually, e-filing and e-payment will become mandatory for all.\n\n\n \n\nKeep in mind that the BIR is serious in achieving paperless\nfiling of returns and payment of taxes.\n\n\n\n \n\nFor taxpayers who have not yet invested in the required hardware\nand software to use the EFPS (  i.e.  a computer with a\nmodem, an Internet service provider, a browser and an e-mail account), now is\na good time to start.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "242a8e05-d453-483d-b380-b1f685104c8b", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.304291+00:00"}

Such activities include:\n\n\n2.7.1.1. limited practice of a profession ( including teaching under\na consortium program or in universities with which De La Salle University has\na memorandum of agreement);\n\n\n2.7.1.2. management of a private enterprise, if discipline-related;\n\n\n2.7.1.3. outside consultancy;\n\n\n2.7.1.4 special detail to government or to non-governmental\ninstitutions ( educational and non-educational) with which the University has\na memorandum of agreement;\n\n\n2.7.1.5 research and other projects under the auspices of other\ninstitutions and agencies. \n\n \n\nThese activities require prior authorization from the Executive\nVice-President upon endorsement by the Dean and the head of the unit\nconcerned. \n\n \n\n2.7.2 Outside consultancy, special detail to government, and\noff-campus research shall form part of the regular load, subject to approval\nbased on the following:\n\n\n2.7.2.1 The faculty member retains the regular teaching load, and\nprovides the required number of student consultation hours.\n\n\n2.7.2.2 The activities shall not exceed ten ( 10) hours of the\nregular work schedule of forty ( 40) hours required of all full-time academic\nfaculty members.\n\n\n2.7.2.3 The activities are not contrary to the interests of the\nUniversity. \n\n\n 2.8 Graduate studies \n\n \n\nReduction in working hours for graduate studies shall be\nequivalent to two ( 2) times the number of units enrolled in provided the\ntotal does not exceed twelve ( 12) hours, of which three ( 3) hours must be\nin residence.\n\n\nFaculty members writing their thesis/dissertation shall be granted a\nreduction in teaching and work load based on the provisions on faculty\ndevelopment. \n\n \n\nAnyone carrying a graduate study load of six ( 6) units or more\nwill not be allowed to do consultancy or carry an overload.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c762e6bc-c414-4810-b143-a4fa3b90dc31", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.305718+00:00"}
{"text": "About the Bureau of Customs  \n\n\n General Information \n\n\n MISSION \n\n \n\nThe Bureau of Customs ( BOC) aims to provide a customs service\nmore responsive to clients ' needs and supportive of government goals, and\nadhering to world 's best practices that every Filipino can be truly proud\nof. \n\n\n OBJECTIVE \n\n \n\nThe BOC is expected to perform the following primary functions:\n\n\nassess and collect lawful revenues from imported articles and all\nother dues, fees, charges, fines and penalties accruing under the Tariff and\nCustoms Code ( TCC);\n\n\nprevent and suppress smuggling and fraud in customs administration;\n\n\nsupervise and control the entrance and clearance of vessels and\naircraft engaged in foreign trade;\n\n\nenforce TCC and all other laws, rules and regulations relating to\ntariff and customs administration;\n\n\nsupervise and control the handling of foreign mail arriving in the\nPhilippines, for the purpose of collecting lawful duty on the dutiable\narticles thus imported, and prevent smuggling through medium of such mail;\n\n\nsupervise and control all import and export cargoes, landed or stored\nin piers and terminal facilities, including container yards and freight\nstations; and\n\n\nexercise exclusive jurisdiction over seizure and forfeiture cases\nunder the Tariff and Customs laws. \n\n\n STRATEGY \n\n \n\nBOC 's strategic thrusts are:\n\n\n Revenue generation:  collect targeted revenues through\nimproved collection efficiency and plugging of revenue leakages;\n\n\n Trade facilitation:  support government programs through\nspeedy clearing of goods and passengers from Customs;\n\n\n Intelligence and enforcement:  protect society against\nprohibited drugs and other harmful substances, and illegal trade of natural\nresources; and\n\n\n Internal administration of bureau resources:  support the\ngovernment 's thrust to streamline the bureaucracy and to employ resources\nmore effectively. \n\n\n ORGANIZATION \n\n \n\nBOC is headed by the Customs Commissioner.\n\n\nHe is assisted by five Deputy Commissioners and fourteen District\nCollectors who supervise the different departments. \n\n \n\n Internal Administration Group. \n\n\nUnder a Deputy Commissioner, this group assists the Commissioner in\nthe formulation of policies and in the setting up of objectives relative to\nfinancial, administrative, personnel, planning and management improvement\nservices of the BOC; represents the Commissioner in meetings and conferences;\nsigns memorandum circulars; and reviews official communications and documents\nrelevant to internal administration. \n\n \n\n Revenue Collection Monitoring Group. \n\n\nUnder a Deputy Commissioner, this group maintains an accounting of\nrevenues collected; administers the legal requirements of the BOC; provides\ninformation and analysis of collection statistics; and audits liquidated\nentries and bonds. \n\n \n\n Assessment and Operations Coordination Group  .\n\n\nUnder a Deputy Commissioner, this group gathers and publishes of\nvalues of commodities imported into the country; and monitors implementation\nof rules and regulations governing assessment, end processing of goods for\nexports, warehousing and support operations, and auction and disposal\nactivities. \n\n \n\n Intelligence and Enforcement Group. \n\n\nUnder a Deputy Commissioner, this group gathers intelligence\ninformation related to Customs and economic activities; conducts internal\ninquiry and investigation; and exercises police authority. \n\n \n\n Management Information System and Technology Group ( MISTG).\n\n\n\nTo ensure its continuing progress, the implementation of BOC 's\ncomputerization program necessitated the creation of MISTG on January 9, 1998\nunder Executive Order No. 463.\n\n\nThe need for the creation of a greatly expanded IT group was already\nreflected in the 1992 ISP as a support to the aim for BOC to assume direct\nmanagement and control of IT facilities and services after the conclusion of\nthe transitional facilities management arrangements under the PTCP contract.\n\n\nMISTG is headed by a Deputy Commissioner who is responsible for\noverall supervision of the different operating units. \n\n \n\n Collection Districts. \n\n\nEach District is headed by a District Collector of Customs and\ncollects duties, taxes and other charges accruing to the government;\nexercises police powers; supervises the entrance and clearance of vessels\nengaged in commerce; supervises and controls handling of foreign mail; and\nsupervises all import and export cargoes and freight stations. \n\n\n OPERATIONAL PLANS / TACTICS \n\n \n\nThe Bureau conceptualized the SPACE Program as early as 1998 to\nimplement a Cargo Clearance Procedure that will meet the requirements of the\n21st century.\n\n\nSPACE stands for the five general principles underlying the\nprogressive clearance procedure.\n\n\nSpecifically, it means:\n\n\n Selectivity:  only high-risk shipments will undergo the\nregular clearance process while majority will be given express processing\n\n\n Post Audit:  shipments given express clearance maybe\nsubjected to post audit or some form of release clearance process\n\n\n Advance Processing:  the clearance process will be initiated\nwell in advance of cargo arrival\n\n\n Client Self-Assessment:  BOC shall increase its reliance on\nclient self-assessment and develop an atmosphere of honest and fair dealings\n\n\n Electronic Data Interchange:  the process will be, to the\nfullest extent possible, automated and computerized \n\n\n BACKGROUND \n\n \n\nThe rapid advances in the fields of transportation,\ncommunications and information technology have made the world a lot smaller.\n\n\nIt has also eased the flow of information, goods and people across\nborders, which, in turn, have become increasingly porous.\n\n\nThis development has led to a progressive rise in the level of trade.\n\n\nThe free flow of information has enabled the suppliers of traded\ngoods and services to more easily discern emerging global patterns of demand,\nand the growing ease with which goods could be transported to major markets\nin the globe has enabled them to meet these demands in a timely fashion.\n\n\nThe increasing importance of international trade to the economic\nwell-being of nations has led to the founding of the World Trade Organization\nwhich is mandated to seek the establishment of a global environment conducive\nto its free flow. \n\n \n\nAll of these developments converge to pose a unique challenge to\ncustoms administrations.\n\n\nThe increased level and rate of trade flows impose work burdens that\nwould be close to impossible to address without the use of the modern\ntechniques and technology which have led to the emergence of these trade\nflows.\n\n\nThis has given rise to a strong impetus for many to modernize,\ndespite having to face tight budget constraints. \n\n \n\nThe Philippine Bureau of Customs ( BOC) is no exception.\n\n\nFinancial difficulties occasioned by years of moribund economic\ngrowth, have forced government agencies to make do with less in the face of\nsteady workload increases mainly resulting from having to service the growing\nneeds of a population that expands at a rate that is one of the highest in\nthe region.\n\n\nSuch modest economic growth coupled with rapid population increases\ninevitably gives rise to demand that results in increased trade flows which,\nin turn, translates into progressively increased workload for Customs.\n\n\nThis puts the BOC in an unenviable position of being pressured from\nboth ends of its client spectrum: the pressure of having to collect more\nrevenue to support the growing needs of an increasingly overburdened\nbureaucracy on the one end, and the pressure of having to face increased\nworkloads from the transacting public with virtually stagnant resources, on\nthe other.\n\n\nBeing faced with such a dilemma brings about a strong incentive to\nappreciate the merits of modernization.\n\n\nHaving to squeeze the last iota of output from tightly constrained\nresources tends to galvanize efforts towards efficiency and cost\neffectiveness.\n\n\nThe virtues of automation become starkly evident when viewed in\ncontrast with the lack of skilled personnel for highly technical complex\ntasks. \n\n \n\nHowever, modernization in this case is not just a matter of\nadopting modern technology and efficient streamlined procedures, as it has to\nbe undertaken in an environment defined by changes imposed by the coming into\nforce of WTO agreements on trade, the most dominant of which is the Agreement\non Customs Valuation.\n\n\nSince the focus of these agreements is the free and untrammeled flow\nof trade, the changes that they mandate provide a solid foundation for BOC 's\nmodernization efforts.\n\n\nThe shift to a valuation system that is based on the transacted price\nbetween the importer and his supplier has mandated a paradigm change in the\nway BOC carries out its import assessment tasks: the focus of control is now\nshifted from the border at pre-release to the importer 's premises at post\nrelease and is carried out in an audit mode.\n\n\nThis plan therefore seeks to recast the BOC into an organization that\nis well equipped with latest technology and skills to pursue its goals, in a\nclient-focused manner, through effective partnerships with business and its\nother stakeholders, and with transparency and accountability as its main\nhallmarks. \n\n \n\nIt is against this backdrop that BOC is crafting this corporate\nplan, a dynamic document that embodies its organizational projections and\naction agenda for 2001-2004 and beyond. \n\n\n CORPORATE PLAN: 2001-2004 \n\n\n BUREAU OF CUSTOMS \n\n\n VISION STATEMENT \n\n \n\nA World-Class Customs Service more responsive to

to address\nenforcement and control issues to be able to refocus scarce resources to\nhigh-risk imports.\n\n\n&bullet; Escalating national budget requirements pushing customs to\nmeet expanding revenue targets, to plug revenue leakage, and prevent\nsmuggling and other fraud against Customs revenue.\n\n\n&bullet; Heightening competition among world economies prompting the\ngovernment to lend support to local industry and to work for an environment\nconducive to foreign investment and trade.\n\n\n&bullet; Intensifying clamor for more transparency in public service\nand eradication of graft and corruption in government that motivates customs\nto further improve its systems and procedures, and the quality of its\nservice.\n\n\n Internal : \n\n\n&bullet; Need for more vital performance indicators (  e.g.\n accurate measure of actual daily collection per district).\n\n\n&bullet; Need for more performance standards for determining the\nquality of its operations and services.\n\n\n&bullet; Need for better coordination between and among\ndivisions/units, to prevent revenue leakage.\n\n\n&bullet; Need for improved linkages with other government agencies\ninvolved in the shipment clearance process.\n\n\n&bullet; Need for a better work environment conducive to high level\nof efficiency, integrity and pro-active communication.\n\n\n Revenue Enhancement ( KR\n# 1) \n\n\n Context: \n\n \n\nBOC annually contributes the second largest amount in collected\nrevenues to the National Treasury.\n\n\nIts collection performance thus has a substantial impact on the\nincreasing budget requirements of the government. \n\n \n\nAccelerating globalization and increasing competition among\ntrading nations are expected to put a lot of pressure on BOC 's efforts to\ncollect more revenues in terms of having to deal with higher volume but lower\nvaluation of imported goods and unfair and fraudulent trade practices.\n\n\nMoreover, the speed at which commercial transactions are consummated\nand the rapid transport of goods and people across frontiers add to this\npressure.\n\n\nTo make matters worse, both the current worldwide economic slowdown\nand the perceived problem on peace and order have adversely affected BOC 's\ncollection performance.\n\n\nThe adoption of the Transaction Value System as our commitment under\nthe WTO Agreement on Valuation is expected to have a negative impact on\nrevenue collection.\n\n\nBOC has also to contend with the progressive reduction of the\naverage tariff rates every year due to the country 's multilateral trade\ncommitment such as AFTA.\n\n\nAlso affecting collection is the existence of several laws granting\nexemptions to certain importations as safety nets and to attract investments\nsuch as those covered by Agricultural and Fisheries Modernization Act ( AFMA)\nand those destined to Special Economic Zones and free ports.\n\n\nIt is therefore critical for BOC to beef up its collection effort\nthrough modernization and automation and, at the same time, aggressively plug\nits revenue leakages. \n\n \n\nAn indispensable tool in beefing up its collection framework is\nthe immediate institution of a system by which its key performance indicators\ncan be accurately and regularly monitored.\n\n\nThis should begin with the daily monitoring and analysis of revenue\ncollections by district and by port. \n\n \n\nIn its drive for a more efficient and prompt collection of\nrevenue while at the same time relying upon the importer 's self-assessment,\nBOC must begin to work more closely with its clientele, giving them the\nnecessary information regarding their rights and obligations, providing them\nwith better opportunities for informed compliance, but at the same time,\nbecoming more vigilant in administering sanctions against violators of\nCustoms laws, rules and regulations.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

\n\n \n\n  Too much blusher.  \n\n\n \" Brides must be queens and not mannequins, &rdquo;\n Reyes says.\n\n\n \" Putting too much blusher will make them look like\nRaggedy Anns.\n\n\nBrides with soft supple skin can in fact do away with blusher for\nthat more natural look. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n  So much red.  \n\n\n \" You will notice in some photos how the lips of the\nbride dominate her whole face.\n\n\nThat is because the lipstick used was too red.\n\n\nThe bride need not catch attention by putting on very red lipstick\nor blusher because whatever happens, she is the star of the show! &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\n  Hair and makeup that 's not suited for the time of\nthe wedding.  \n\n\n \" There is such a thing as hair and makeup\nspecifically for morning, for early or late afternoon, and for evening\nweddings.\n\n\nColors and degree of application vary according to the time of the\nday.\n\n\nMorning weddings require light makeup.\n\n\nGarden weddings will have more impact if the bride wears her hair\ndown with some dashers of flowerets on the hair. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n  Difficult hairstyle.  \n\n\n \" Unless there is someone at the beck and call of the\nbride to fix her hair, it is better that the bride sport a fuss-free\nhairstyle.\n\n\nIt can be worn down but should be pinned or slicked neatly, away\nfrom the face. &rdquo;   \n\n\n  Lipstick on the teeth.  \n\n\n \" One common mistake of the makeup artist is to\ndisregard the use of lip sheen-er, which can actually avoid smearing.\n\n\nYou will thus notice that some brides have lipstick on their teeth\neven before they arrive in the church. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n  Wrong length of false eyelashes.  \n\n\nHighlighting the eyebrow and the eyelashes give life to any makeup.\n\n\nHowever, some makeup artists do not know how to choose the right\nlength of lashes for the bride.\n\n\nThe trick?\n\n\n \" Choose false lashes that are 3/4 of the height of\nthe eye.\n\n\nTrim the corners, too, &rdquo;  Ricky says. \n\n \n\n  Overpowering flowers on the hair.  \n\n\n \" The stylist should know how to proportion the flower\nas a hairpiece with the size and shape of the bride 's face.\n\n\nOtherwise, she will be overpowered.\n\n\nAmong the recommended flowers are cattleya, aster, baby 's breath,\nand tiny shasta daisies. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n  Ignoring test makeup.  \n\n\n \" Test makeup will give you a preview of how you will\nlook on your wedding day.\n\n\nGo for a photo shoot if you want to be sure so that you will also\nknow how the hair and makeup will be in actual wedding pictures.\n\n\nDo this a month before the wedding date, and if you have the budget,\ngo for another makeup test two weeks before D-Day. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n  Not telling the stylist what you want.  \n\n\n \" Because stylists are supposed to be the experts,\nsome brides are apprehensive of telling the stylists their preference.\n\n\nThis should not be the case because the outcome should be a\ncollaborative work between them.\n\n\nTell the stylist if you do not feel comfortable with a certain\nhairstyle or makeup. &rdquo;", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c2c7f740-506f-4221-a272-b929a6b0df4a", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.309928+00:00"}

 \n\n \n\n Sogetsu  can work with driftwoods, gnarled\nroots, corals, weather-worn stones, dried flowers, and shells.\n\n\nUsually, Flipo goes around Urdaneta Village in Makati, where she\nlives, to check out what her neighbors ' gardens have thrown out.\n\n\nOne of the rooms in her house is already filled with twigs, dried\nleaves, chicken wires, flower holders, and different kinds of vases. \n\n \n\nJust before this interview, Flipo showed us a dry  acacia\n branch, which she found the night before, spruced up with red\ndracaena and spray mums, and stylishly placed on a reddish cylindrical vase.\n\n\nIt looked beautiful and refreshing. \n\n \n\nFlipo fuses dried items with fresh ones.\n\n\nShe incorporates cut-down twigs with banana leaves, heliconia, palm\nleaves or dendrobium leaves. \n\n \n\n \" You cannot do  ikebana \nwithout branches.\n\n\nIt creates wonderful shapes and lines, &rdquo;  she says.\n\n\n \n\nIt 's always ideal to display an  ikebana \narrangement on top of the coffee table or at the entrance.\n\n\nFlipo reminds one  ikebana  arrangement is enough\nto brighten up the room.\n\n\n \" If you put more, you will look like you 're having a\nprivate exhibit, &rdquo;  Flipo quips. \n\n \n\nThe  Sogetsu  Schol of  ikebana\n was founded by Sofu Teshigahara in 1927.\n\n\nTeshigahara was the first Japanese to introduce  ikebana\n to the world beyond Japan. \n\n \n\n Sogetsu  is a modern school of \nikebana  which created its own style in breaking away from the\nclassic flower arrangement method while conforming to the classic criteria of\n ikebana  . \n\n \n\n \"  Sogetsu  is known as\nsculpture with flowers, using any kind of material displayed anywhere in any\ncircumstance, &rdquo;  says Flipo. \n\n \n\nThe  Sogetsu  School uses plants and flowers\nto express vividly the experiences of the present age. \n\n \n\nTraditional  ikebana  is based on strict rules\nand principles.\n\n\nDepending on the style being practiced, certain stems must be cut to\nparticular lengths and positioned at specific angles.\n\n\n Sogetsu   ikebana  is always\nalive.\n\n\nThere are rules, but they are always flexible. \n\n \n\n Ikebana  , Flipo explains, is not just\narranging one type of flower.\n\n\n \" You take parts of any flower which appeal to you and\narrange them into one integrated work.\n\n\nDepending on the way the various parts flow together, the result is\nan everchanging floral kaleidoscope.\n\n\n Ikebana  is not just about the flowers, it 's\nalso about the person who arranges them. &rdquo;  \n\n\n   Ikebana  classes  \n\n \n\nFlipo obtained four years of intensive  ikebana\n training at  Sogetsu  School in Tokyo.\n\n\nShe spent five years teaching  Sogetsu  in Paris\nbefore coming to the Philippines.\n\n\nShe now heads the school 's Manila branch and holds  ikebana\n classes at her home in Urdaneta Village. \n\n \n\nShe also gives occasional demonstrations to the Rotary Club,\n Ikebana  International Chapters, Swiss Ladies Club,\nBritish Women 's Club and Makati Garden Club. \n\n \n\nFlipo holds classes thrice a week.\n\n\nShe teaches basic techniques using textbooks ( an English version on\none side and Japanese on the other). \n\n \n\nThere are no limitations or strict regulations for remaining in a\nbasic or patternized form of arranging flowers.\n\n\nA variety of flower arrangements is expected naturally--according to\nmaterials, the seasons and the individual. \n\n \n\nBasic equipments for flower arrangement include a pair of\nscissors to cut branches and flowers, flower holders and vases. \n\n \n\nStudents begin by studying basic styles which every school\nstudies.\n\n\nOne is called \"   moribana  \n\" , a method of fixing flowers on a shallow container called\n\"   suiban   \" with the use of\n  Kenzan   , a needlepoint holder used to fix the\nmaterials.\n\n\nAnother style is   nageire   , a method\nof fixing flowers in tall vases without any particular ready-made device.\n\n\n \n\nAnother basic style is freestyle.\n\n\n \" It 's something they just fix themselves, combining\ncertain materials and look wonderful to them, &rdquo;  says Flipo.\n\n\n \n\nThe harmony between the vases, the materials and the way of\nputting them all together is extremely important in  Sogetsu\n , Flipo adds.\n\n\nCertain measurements, such as the main line, diameter, height, depth\nand mass lines, are also essential so everything else will be in proportion.\n\n\n \n\nAside from the basics,  ikebana  students are\nalso taught how to buy, condition and preserve the flowers.\n\n\nFlipo also encourages her students, mostly women, to be imaginative\nand creative in all their works. \n\n\n  Relaxing activity  \n\n \n\nFlipo grew up in South Africa and studied in London.\n\n\nShe worked in an advertising agency in South Africa for 14 years and\nmarried a French journalist.\n\n\nThey lived in China where she first encountered  ikebana\n in 1973, and went to Japan in 1976. \n\n \n\nShe moved to the Philippines three years ago to join her husband,\nnow a manager of  Agence France Presse  Manila bureau.\n\n\nFlipo, 63, leads Manila 's  Sogetsu  Society,\nwhich also has branches in Davao and Cagayan de Oro. \n\n \n\nFor Flipo, who 's been in the industry for more than a decade,\nflower arranging is a very relaxing activity, aside from finding it\ncreatively challenging. \n\n \n\n \" There 's a moment of serenity.\n\n\nPeople seem to unwind just handling plants.\n\n\nPersonally, I like the good smell of fresh leaves and flowers,\"\n she discloses.  \n\n \n\n \" Flower arranging should not be a moment of\nstress.\n\n\nThey always say the end result is less important than the pleasure\nyou derive from doing it.\n\n\nOne should not be devoted merely to adjusting forms, but should\nfirst get enjoyment from the arranging.\n\n\nThere should be a desire to express oneself and to create, and this\nmust be fulfilled and set free. &rdquo;   \n\n \n\nFlipo discourages her students to spend a long time in one\nparticular arrangement.\n\n\n \" There 's no great merit in working on a flower\narrangement for two hours.\n\n\nThe more you handle your materials the more they get weak. &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\nIf one can do it within 15 minutes, the better the result, Flipo\nsays.\n\n\n \" It 's often the most successful work because you 've\nconceptualized the whole thing ahead of time and work on it according to your\ninstinct. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nTo better understand and appreciate the beauty of \nikebana  , a demo-workshop will be conducted by Yoka Hosono, one of\nthe master instructors of  Sogetsu  School in Tokyo. \n\n \n\nHosono will present  Sogetsu  basic and\nfreestyle arrangements on Oct. 14 and 15 at Dusit Hotel Nikko 's Grand\nBallroom.\n\n\nIt is sponsored by  Sogetsu  Society of Manila.\n\n\nThis year 's theme is \" Salute to Philippine Centennial.\n&rdquo;  \n\n\n\n\n  Steps in the film animation process  \n\n\n Nestor U. Torre \n\n \n\nOUR recent articles on the making of Dream Works ' first animated\nfeature, \" \" The Prince of Egypt, &rdquo; \" has\ninterested some readers in learning more about film animation.\n\n\nSome of them hope to end up working in the field of animation\nthemselves.\n\n\nThis isn't a pipe dream, because Filipinos are believed to be\nspecially adept at animation, and are prized workers in many animation\nstudios abroad. \n\n \n\nWhat is the process involved?\n\n\nAnimation can be achieved in many ways.\n\n\nMost cartoons are drawn by hand and the drawings representing\nfractions of movement are shot frame by frame.\n\n\nRecently, computer animation has also become popular.\n\n\nThen there 's puppet animation, object animation and the silhouette\nfilm. \n\n \n\nFor starters, let 's focus on the traditional method of\nhand-drawn sequential images used in the classic animated films of old.\n\n\nThe steps involved include:\n\n\nA  good idea  for the film.\n\n\nJerome K. Muller of \" Animation Magazine \" says that\nthe idea usually comes from the studio head or the director, who introduces\nit to the story department for discussion and development. \n\n\n  Blueprint  \n\n \n\n Brainstorming sessions  follow.\n\n\nAfter a number of these, a full set of  storyboard drawings\n is completed and discussed.\n\n\nAn animated feature requires thousands of storyboard drawings ( rough\nsketches), which serve as a \" blueprint &rdquo; for the film in\nshot-by-shot progression.\n\n\nBits of dialogue are often included in the drawings. \n\n \n\nAfter the storyboard is approved by the director or the studio\nhead, it is sent to the  music department  , which \n\" times it out, &rdquo;  setting it to appropriate beats or\nrhythms.\n\n\nVery often, the final score is done after the film is finished. \n\n \n\nWhile music and character voices are being selected, the model\ndepartment is busy doing various  character development studies \nand  model sheets  .\n\n\nThese are reproduced and used as guides by the animators and other\npeople working on the production. \n\n \n\nThe director supervises every step in the production of the\nanimated film.\n\n\nHe usually does a series of preliminary layout drawings which will\nbe passed along to the appropriate artists as reference. \n\n \n\nWorking mainly from the storyboards, the  layout\ndepartment  maps out each scene.\n\n\nThe layout man is like a stage director, camera director and set\ndesigner.\n\n\nHe must determine the position of each character in relation to the\nbackground during every moment of the film. \n\n \n\nThe  detailed pencil drawings  produced by the\nlayout department are used as a guide by the  background artists\n , who will collaborate with the director and a color consultant to\nestablish the movie 's overall mood.\n\n\nBackgrounds are usually painted in watercolor. \n\n \n\nBoth music and dialogue soundtracks are written on \nexposure sheets  which are used by the animators and cameramen.\n\n\nThe exposure sheet breaks down the sound and action, with each bit\nmeasured in 1/24th of a second, corresponding to the number of frames flashed\non the screen each second. \n\n \n\n( Early silent films ran at 16 frames per second.\n\n\nWhen the optical soundtrack was introduced in 1927, that proved too\nslow for accurate reproduction of voices and music, so 24 frames per second\nbecame the standard speed for sound films.) \n\n \n\nThe  supervising animator  does all the key\nanimation drawings, called \" \"  extremes  .\n&rdquo; \"\n\n\nFor instance, if an action or movement takes 13 drawings to\ncomplete, the head animator will probably do drawings no. 1 and 13. \n\n\n  Key drawings  \n\n \n\nThe key drawings are then given to the assistant animator, who\ndoes the \" \"  breakdown  , &rdquo; \"\nprobably drawing no. 7.\n\n\nHe may also do a further breakdown of drawings no. 4 and 10.\n\n\nFor a  difficult action  , the head animator may\n\" rough in &rdquo; every drawing, letting his assistant do the \"\nclean-ups. &rdquo; \n\n \n\nThen, the assistant animator passes on the finished extremes and\nbreakdowns ( nos. 1, 4, 7, 10 and 13) to the \"  inbetweeners\n , &rdquo; who do the balance of the drawings ( nos. 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9,\n11 and 12) required to complete the action. \n\n \n\nA scene can run several minutes.\n\n\nWhen all the drawings for the scene are completed, they are checked\nby the animator and the director.\n\n\nAfter they are  approved  , they are \" pencil\ntested, &rdquo;  photographed  and played back to insure their\ncorrectness. \n\n \n\nAfter the scene passes this test, it goes to the  ink and\npaint department  .\n\n\n\" Inkers &rdquo; go to work first,  tracing  each\npencil drawing onto a sheet of acetate with ink.\n\n\nIn recent years, many studios have used the  Xerox \nprocess to transfer the drawings to the cels, saving time and money. \n\n \n\nAfter inking or Xeroxing, each cel is flipped over and \npainted  on the reverse side.\n\n\nAn acrylic paint specially made to stick to acetate is used.\n\n\nCels are painted on clear acetate so that the background can be seen\nbehind the subject.  \n\n\n  The  Zen  in tea  \n\n \n\nIT 'S GOOD hot or iced, but \" The French Baker\n\" , knowing the  Pinoy  's penchant for invention, is\noffering surprising alternatives to enjoying one of the world 's healthiest\nbeverages with the delightful variants of \" St. Dalfour Organic tea\n\" . \n\n \n\n\" St. Dalfour Organic tea \" is now served at\nall \" The French Baker \" stores in Metro Manila, Pampanga\nand Metro Cebu.

PEEL off the skin from one side of the watermelon with a knife.\n\n\n2. MAKE a small, circular outline at the center of the peeled side of\nthe fruit using a razor-sharp carving knife.\n\n\nThis is where the first few petals will be carved.\n\n\n3. TO FORM a petal, first make a short, thin layer in zigzag manner\nto mimic a flower 's uneven curves.\n\n\nThen cut a thick layer beside it, still in zigzag manner, to make way\nfor another petal and to create a space between them.\n\n\n4. WHEN the flower in the small circle is done, create smaller\nflowers by carving an oblong outline around it.\n\n\nWork on the smaller flower within the oblong using the same\nprocedure.\n\n\nContinue carving until one side of the watermelon is done. \n\n\n\n\n  Soap opera  \n\n\nPosted:5:59 PM ( Manila Time) | Jun. 19, 2002\n\n\n By Anne A. Jambora \n\n\n Inquirer News Service \n\n \n\nFOR TEERAPATH, carving has become a habit, a second nature of\nsorts.\n\n\nWhile some Filipinas probably cross-stitch or do crochet while\nwatching TV, Teerapath carves soaps instead.\n\n\n \" Carving makes me happy.\n\n\nI enjoy the craft so much that when I was in Thailand, every time my\nhusband drove me to work and we got stuck in traffic I carved soaps, &rdquo;\n she says. \n\n \n\nThe tricky part is carving soaps as they vary in consistency,\ndepending on the chemical ingredients.\n\n\nSo Teerapath uses \" homemade &rdquo; soaps in varying colors\ninstead, available in most department stores in the metropolis.\n\n\nTo make soaps easier to carve, Teerapath melts them in slow fire\nuntil they 're in liquid form; she then molds them into blocks.\n\n\n \" Just add a little amount of water when melting soaps.\n\n\nOnce they 're completely melted, stop the fire or else the soap will\nturn black, &rdquo;  she says. \n\n \n\nA bunch of about 20 soap flowers starts at 1,500 pesos, including\narrangement and makeshift vase.  \n\n\n1. CUT a block of soap in half, then carve to a cone-like shape.\n\n\nWork on the thin part first.\n\n\n( For roses, form a round shape instead, with a thicker bottom.)\n\n\n2. SLICE thin layers from top to bottom to form petals.\n\n\nMake sure to form each petal one over the other.\n\n\n3. GENTLY bend the petals.\n\n\nDepending on the type of flower, you can opt to bend the petals\neither all the way down, halfway through or just around the tip.\n\n\n4. TO PERFECTLY form the petals, trim the tips in accordance to the\nflower you are creating - rose, lily, etc.\n\n\nUsing the tip of the carving knife, create ridges if desired.\n\n\nWork on the inner petals by carefully slicing around the inside of\nthe petals.\n\n\nBend the petals if desired, but remember to gradually close the\npetals as you get near the center of the flower.\n\n\nTrim the tips of the petals. \n\n\n\n\n  Meet the new year with a mini waterfall garden \n\n\n\nPosted: 8:52 PM ( Manila Time) | January 17, 2002\n\n\n By Tita Giron \n\n\n Inquirer News Service \n\n \n\nPLANT arts expert Serapion Mettilla has added something new to\nthe current craze in water gardening.\n\n\nInstead of the usual mini waterfalls with imitation rocks and\nartificial plants, he has come up with landscaped waterfalls using natural\nmaterials. \n\n \n\nSeveral artificial mini waterfalls and small table fountains have\nbeen showing up in the market because of the positive influence they 're\nsupposed to bring, as popularized by  feng shui  and\n Zen  advocates. \n\n \n\nUnlike the usual mini waterfalls with imitation rocks, stones,\nand artificial plants, Metilla 's works are made of volcanic rocks, cinders,\nand clay.\n\n\nHe uses live plants and miniature trees, the secret elements that\ngive his waterfall gardens a distinct touch of nature. \n\n \n\nOf course, Metilla 's know-how in  bonsai \nculture and plant arts makes the difference.\n\n\nWe can tell.\n\n\nOver the last 30 years or so, we 've listened to his countless\nlectures, followed his gardening columns and saw his different plant art\nworks. \n\n \n\nHis recent lecture-demonstration on waterfall gardens has no\ndoubt drawn a lot of interest.\n\n\nOne prominent lady, for instance, was said to have been so impressed\nthat she ordered several pieces to give friends last Christmas. \n\n \n\nAnd listen to this.\n\n\nA jet engine instructor from the US happened to watch him demonstrate\nthe making of waterfall gardens during the recent  Ikebana\n International exhibit at Intercon Hotel.\n\n\nWeeks later, Metilla received a letter from the jet engineer who\nenclosed a photo of the waterfall he made at home in the US with his son,\nbased on Metilla 's instructions. \n\n \n\nThe engineer thanked Metilla.\n\n\nIt was fun making the waterfall, he wrote.\n\n\nHe added that it saved him a lot of money because table waterfalls\nbeing sold at US shops now cost 175 dollars and up.\n\n\nAccording to the jet engineer, he only spent 8 dollars for lava rocks\nand 15 dollars for the submersible water pump.\n\n\nThe rest of the materials were either free or inexpensive, including\nthe water catchment pond that he improvised with a birdbath. \n\n\n  Waterfall soothes the spirit  \n\n \n\n \" There is nothing like the sound of waterfall to\nsoothe a tired body, &rdquo;  Metilla said.\n\n\nHe added that moving water improves air quality in the environment\nand helps reduce pollution produced by car emissions, smoke, and other\npollutants. \n\n \n\n \" The sight and sound of a gentle waterfall is\nconducive to meditation.\n\n\nIt is a perfect focal point for contemplation, &rdquo;  he\nadded. \n\n \n\nIt is also believed to attract luck, which is why mini waterfalls\nand ponds are usually located near the entrance of buildings.\n\n\nIn  feng shui  , water is one of the most valuable\ncomponent of a meditation garden, whether it is a fountain, a pond, or a\ngentle waterfall.\n\n\n \" The water movement is important and should not make a\nloud gushing or torrential sound to distract one 's contemplation, &rdquo;\n he pointed out. \n\n \n\nMetilla also said that besides the possible luck it brings, the\nwaterfall is a welcome sight for the tired mind and body. \n\n\n  Materials needed   \n\n\n- Volcanic rock, preferably irregular in form, is the choice of\nMetilla.\n\n\nCustomers have a choice from heights ranging two feet to six feet.\n\n\n- Clay may be store-bought or dug from the garden.\n\n\nThis is needed to cover roots of plants and to hold them secure on\nthe rock until the roots are able to establish plants.\n\n\n- Submersible pump, also called circulating motor.\n\n\nThey vary according to power required by the size of the rock and the\nwaterfall.\n\n\n- Concrete basin or water catchment may be rectangular, round, oval,\nor irregular.\n\n\nIt should be deep enough to contain rock and water.\n\n\nMetilla chooses containers with irregular shape to complement the\nnatural contour of the volcanic rock.\n\n\n- Clay, compost, cement, sand, hose, and wire.\n\n\n- Planting materials should be small, of varying height, and are\ntolerant of humid and shade area.\n\n\nFor rock cover and niche fillers, he plants small ferns, ivy,\n mondo  grass, lichens and mosses.\n\n\nTo create height perspective, he opts for  bonsai\n trees, miniature  ti  plants, \nsyngonium  , philodendron, and other plants that tolerate shady and\nhumid locations.\n\n\n\n\n- Length and size of hose will depend on the size and power of\nsubmersible pump, also the height of rock.\n\n\nIdeally, Metilla uses l/2 inch diameter hose.\n\n\n- For his tools, Metilla uses electric drill, hammer, chisel or any\nhard object that can be used to carve the rock. \n\n\n  Procedure   \n\n\nAfter cleaning the volcanic rock and chiseling the rough edges,\nMetilla uses the electric drill to make holes from the rock 's back to the\ntop where the waterfall is supposed to start.\n\n\nHe inserts the water hose originating from the pump through the hole\nand holds it in place with cement. \n\n \n\n \" For a natural look, use either black or red\ncement that blends with the color of the volcanic rock, &rdquo; \nMetilla advises. \n\n \n\nWater pressure is important to control the flow of water and to\ncontain it within the catch basin.\n\n\nThe ideal container for a 2.5 feet rock is four inches deep, 2.5\nfeet long, and can contain six gallons of water.\n\n\n \" It is also very important to keep the pump\nunderwater so it does not overheat, &rdquo;  Metilla cautioned. \n\n \n\nHaving positioned the rock on top of the container, Metilla\nlandscapes the rock.\n\n\nThe roots of  Ficus  or  balete \nare inserted into deep crevices filled with compost and covered with live\nmoss.\n\n\n \"  Ficus  trees have deep\npenetrating roots that anchor them to rocks, &rdquo;  he explained.\n\n\nHis other choices are mini  melendres  ,\nbougainvillea and powder puff trees. \n\n \n\nAfter planting the bigger materials, he covers the rock surface\nwith carpet moss, lichens, and ferns.\n\n\nThe bases are held in place by clay. \n\n \n\nNewly landscaped waterfall gardens are sheltered for the first\nfew days in a shady but well-lighted place.\n\n\nKeep it well-watered until the plants are established. \n\n \n\n \" Be guided by the photo of a waterfall garden if\nyou have no idea how it looks like, &rdquo;  Metilla tells beginners.\n\n\n\n  Maintenance  \n\n \n\n \" Place your waterfall garden in a location with\nbright light, but not under direct sunlight.\n\n\nYou can bring them indoors in a well-lighted area for five days,\nmaximum.\n\n\nSee that the container is filled with water and the pump is well\nsubmerged. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nFor folks who want to keep the waterfall garden indoors, here is\nMetilla 's suggestion:  \" Provide the plants with ultraviolet\nlights, the same lights used for aquariums.\n\n\nPlace bulbs overhead, about one foot away from plants.\n\n\nIn the evening before you retire to bed, it is advisable to unplug\nthe pump 's motor. &rdquo;

{"text": "Going vegan in 5 easy steps  \n\n\nPosted: 7:03 PM ( Manila Time) &caret; August 21, 2001\n\n\nBy Ivy S. Papa\n\n\nInquirer News Service\n\n\n  Health nut  \n\n \n\nDO you know Dawn Schafer?\n\n\nIf you were at one time a member of the Babysitters Club like I was,\nyou would know who I am talking about. \n\n \n\nDawn, my personal favorite among babysitters, was a health nut and\na true individual.\n\n\nI admire her discipline and self-confidence, attributes not usually\nfound in pubescent girls undergoing an identity crisis and hormonal changes.\n\n\n \n\nGrowing up, I tried to follow Dawn 's example.\n\n\nAt this point, I believe I can shove modesty aside and say I have\nbeen quite successful in achieving my individuality.\n\n\n( It also helps I went to the University of the Philippines where\neccentricity is championed.) \n\n \n\nAs to being a health nut, however, I can only say I am a work in\nprogress.\n\n\nI was brought up a meat-eater.\n\n\nLike most children, I detested healthy, nutritious stuff and\npreferred candy and junk food.\n\n\nLess nutritious foods just seemed to taste better.\n\n\nCharacters like Dawn, fictional or otherwise,  piqued\n my interest in their uncommon diets. \n\n \n\nI have always liked to think of myself as a conscientious and\ncaring person.\n\n\nAnd I 'm proud to say that the desire for self-improvement is a\nconstant in my life.\n\n\nBut although I would like to be in the pink of health, both in body\nand soul, that is not the main reason I chose to follow Dawn 's example and\nbecome a vegetarian.\n\n\nI am a sworn animal lover ( not counting roaches, I suppose) and\nintend to be an animal rights advocate as well. \n\n \n\n\" Intention \" is the key word.\n\n\nAs I have already mentioned, I haven't been completely transformed\nyet.\n\n\nThe best I can do now is to proclaim I do not eat red meat anymore.\n\n\nI am what you might call a \" semi-vegetarian \" .\n\n\nI still eat chicken, fish and other seafoods, although only\noccasionally.\n\n\nMy goal is to become a  lacto  - vegetarian, one\nwho also eats dairy products. \n\n \n\nVegetarianism is not as simple as avoiding meat.\n\n\nThere are several ways to go about it.\n\n\nA vegan or a pure vegetarian is not supposed to take any product that\ncomes from animals, including milk and eggs.\n\n\nOther kinds of vegetarian are:  Lacto  -\nvegetarian--my goal as I have mentioned;  ovo  -\nvegetarian--eats eggs;  lacto-ovo  - vegetarian--eats eggs\nand milk products;  pescetarian  - - eats fish;\nfruitarian--only eats fruits and vegetables that do not destroy the plants\nwhere they came from. \n\n \n\nWe will not even discuss vegetarians who only consume organically\ngrown things and follow a macrobiotic diet ( stuff that is supposed to keep\nyour body in harmony with nature). \n\n \n\nBefore I actually reached this stage of semi-vegetarianism, I\nwent through several vain attempts in the past.\n\n\nI have my sister to thank for joining me in my crusade to shun the\ncarcasses of slaughtered animals. \n\n\n  Eating habits  \n\n \n\nYou should have a certain resolve if you want to become a vegan.\n\n\nIn most cases, it is not merely a diet, but a way of life.\n\n\nYou have to plan how you are going to approach the whole transition.\n\n\nHere are tips on how you can change your eating habits: \n\n \n\n1. Announce--\n\n\nLet it be known to family and friends that you have decided to stop\neating God 's creatures.\n\n\nIt makes quitting later more embarrassing.\n\n\nYou might also surround yourself with sensitive and considerate\npeople who would not drag you to burger joints or offer you hotdogs and\nbacon, thus helping you avoid temptation. \n\n \n\n2. Be knowledgeable--\n\n\nRead about vegetarianism.\n\n\nYou will be able to pick up information, which can help you survive\nthe first stage of your transition.\n\n\nIt will be a good idea to research on vegan restaurants and\nalternative cuisine with meat substitutes like gluten and  tofu\n . \n\n \n\n3. Set aside money for meals--\n\n\nThis should not be a problem if you are already working.\n\n\nBut if you are still dependent on meals prepared by your mother, you\nmight find your hands tied behind your back.\n\n\nYou should not expect the people around you to change just to make\nthings easier for you.\n\n\nIt is wise to get suitable supplies for those occasions when your mom\ndoesn't cook. \n\n \n\n4. Be involved in preparing meals--\n\n\nNumber three should not be a problem if you have a say in the menu.\n\n\nIt will also help you become familiar with vegetarian recipes.\n\n\nBelieve me, vegetarianism is not so difficult if you know how to go\nabout it.\n\n\nNot everything is bland or tastes like sawdust.\n\n\nThere are many tasty vegetarian dishes out there. \n\n \n\n5. Love animals--\n\n\nEvery time you are about to bite into a juicy piece of meat, bear in\nmind that it used to be alive.\n\n\nImagine if your own beloved pet suffers the same fate. \n\n \n\nNot all people are carnivores.\n\n\nOne of the things I remember from Sunday school was the explanation\nwhy many, before the deluge, lived to be 900 or older.\n\n\nThe reason was simply that they did not eat meat. \n\n \n\nPeople only started eating meat after the floods ruined the land.\n\n\nEven if you do not want to reach 100 or do not believe this story, it\nis still a wise idea to be healthy.\n\n\nAnd it is nice to treat other living creatures with respect. \n\n \n\nOne last unsolicited piece of advice: If you decide to stop\neating meat, don't force your views on others.\n\n\nYou may feel more enlightened than them, but it does not give you the\nright to criticize other people 's eating habits.\n\n\nJust quietly set an example and pray it will inspire them to do the\nsame.  \n\n\n\n\n  Healthy and low-cost recipes to try at home  \n\n\nPosted: 7:00 PM ( Manila Time) | September 26, 2001\n\n\nInquirer News Service\n\n \n\nAMONG THE HEALTHIEST food on earth, dry peas and lentils deliver\na world of flavor in dishes that are exotic, unexpected and traditional.\n\n\nIn hundreds of easy-to-prepare recipes--from soups to salads, main\ncourse to desserts--they provide nourishment and sumptuous variety. \n\n \n\nA little meat goes a long way when you stretch it with lentils.\n\n\nTry adding cooked lentils to spaghetti sauce,  lasagna\n or  taco  meat, or other family favorites.\n\n\nOn the other hand, peas work wonders in soups, salads, fried rice and\nstews. \n\n \n\nEating peas and lentils can help reduce the risk of cancer and\nheart disease.\n\n\nOne of the most edible and leading brands in the market, \"\nEasy Cook Peas and Lentils \" are available in 400 g at selected\ngroceries and supermarkets nationwide. \n\n \n\nExclusively distributed by Ideal Macaroni and Spaghetti Factory\nInc., Easy Cook Peas and Lentils come in different variants: Easy Cook Yellow\nSplit Peas, Lentils and Green Split Peas.\n\n\nAlso available are Great Northern Beans,  Pinto \nBeans and Light Red Kidney Beans. \n\n \n\nThese high quality peas and lentils are imported from Idaho, USA\nand are classified as \" US No. 1 grade \" .\n\n\nUse \" Easy Cook Peas and Lentils \" for locked-in\nfreshness and nutrition in food.\n\n\nAll that nutrition and goodness makes low-cost peas and lentils one\nof the best food buys in the supermarket. \n\n\n Healthier Tacos \n\n\n1 c boiled \" Easy Cook Lentils \" , drained very well\n\n\n1/4 kg ground beef\n\n\nSalt and pepper to taste\n\n\n  Salsa  : \n\n\n1/2 c chopped onions\n\n\n1/2 c chopped tomatoes\n\n\n1/4 c crushed  cilantro  leaves\n\n\nsome lemon juice\n\n\nsome tomato juice\n\n\nsome hot sauce\n\n\n1 c grated cheddar cheese\n\n\n1/2 head Baguio lettuce, shredded finely\n\n\n taco  shells\n\n \n\nMash the lentils well.\n\n\nSeason ground beef in a pan till its own oil comes out.\n\n\nCook till ground beef is dry.\n\n\nDrain very well.\n\n\nPrepare the  salsa  of onions, tomatoes, etc.\n\n\n \n\nAssemble: Take one  taco  shell and fill the\nbottom with about 1/4 mashed lentils. \n\n \n\nTop with salsa.\n\n\nTop with lettuce.\n\n\nTop with beef.\n\n\nTop with cheese. \n\n\n New World Pea Soup \n\n\n1/4 kg beef for soup (  campto  , shank, ribs)\n\n\n1/4 kg pork belly ( skin on), sliced into rectangles\n\n\n5-6 cuts parts of chicken\n\n\nenough water to cover the meats and make stock\n\n\n1 medium onion, chopped\n\n\n8-10 garlic cloves, whole\n\n\n1/4 cabbage, cut into wedges\n\n\n3-4 ripe   saba   bananas, cut into 3\n\n\n1 c uncooked \" Easy Cook Lentils \"\n\n \n\nIn a heavy pot, boil beef, pork and chicken meat in water till\ntender.\n\n\nBe sure to add choice herbs for flavoring (  oregano\n , thyme, salt, pepper, liquid seasoning).\n\n\nRemove the meat as they get tender.\n\n\nAdd onions, garlic and lentils.\n\n\nPut back the meat.\n\n\nCook till lentils are almost done.\n\n\nDrop the cabbage and bananas.\n\n\nCook till done, then serve. \n\n\n3 tbsp olive oil\n\n\n1 c uncooked \" Easy Cook Green and Yellow Split Peas\n\"\n\n\n1 medium onion, chopped\n\n\n1/2 can stewed tomatoes\n\n\n1   chorizo de bilbao   , sliced\ndiagonally\n\n\n100 g bacon\n\n\n100 g ham\n\n\n3 chicken bouillon cubes\n\n\n1/2 head of garlic\n\n\n1/4 bay leaf\n\n\nsalt and pepper to taste\n\n\nwater\n\n \n\nHeat olive oil and  saut\u00e9  lentils for\n5 minutes.\n\n\nThen add onions and tomatoes.\n\n\nAdd   chorizo   , ham, bacon and let\ncook till juices are almost dry and oil surfaces.\n\n\nIncrease the heat and add chicken cubes.\n\n\nSeason with garlic, bay leaf, salt and pepper.\n\n\nCover and let simmer gently over low heat till lentils are done.\n  <subtext 3>\n\n\n\n\n  Easy recipes from a non-gardener  \n\n\nPosted: 4:14 PM ( Manila Time) | July 19, 2001\n\n\nBy Adrian V. Lizares\n\n\nInquirer News Service\n\n \n\nCONSIDER a garden with its cultivator having no sense of\ngardening whatsoever.\n\n\nIn the course of my gardening life, I have come across people who\nraise questions like:  \" What can I do to have that little bit\nof green despite my lack of knowledge of plants? &rdquo; \n\n\nOr worse,  \" I can't grow anything.\n\n\nI have a black thumb.\n\n\nPlants die at the sight of me. &rdquo; \n\n\nNonsense!\n\n\nThere is no such thing as a non-gardener.\n\n\nIn each one of us is a gardener at heart. \n\n \n\nIf one were not so knowledgeable of gardens, one should start\noff with the simplest of plants.\n\n\nHaving a very simple garden also means simple maintenance.\n\n\nNo frills in the garden could easily translate into: No hard work\nfor the garden.\n\n\nBut then \" \" simple &rdquo; \" is a relative\nterm. \n\n \n\nTake the case of Georgie Diaz-Balliet, who swears she has no\ngardening capabilities whatsoever.\n\n\nShe has managed to turn a fairly large piece of land into what I\nconsider a successful garden.\n\n\nIt has all the elements of an interesting garden: History,\nfunctionality, and practicality.\n\n\nSince she comes from a large family, the garden is a necessary space\nfor convivial familial get-togethers.  \n\n \n\nThe garden is down to its barest essentials, juxtaposed to the\nstylish settings of Georgie 's home.\n\n\nIt really becomes a blank slate where she invites anyone who is kind\nenough to share with her ideas and tips on what to do with her open space.\n\n\nIt 's an interactive garden, so to speak.\n\n\nYou visit, you give ideas, and you implement them. \n\n \n\nOthers have gone before you, however.\n\n\nGeorgie 's husband William planted  narra  trees in\nreaction to the depletion of natural Philippine forests.\n\n\nThis later gave way to other plants that Jean, his British mother,\nintroduced.\n\n\nThese were high-altitude plants like  auracarias \nand pine trees and a host of flowering plants.\n\n\nGeorgie later introduced tropicals like  heliconias\n and hibiscuses.\n\n\nShe prefers big-leafed varieties like philodendrons.\n\n\nThe fishtail palm provides her with instant bouquets of exotic\nseeds. \n\n \n\nFriends like Nisy Yabut-Conjuanco and Gabby Barredo brought in\ntheir own ideas, too.\n\n\nThey worked together to create a dry bridge accented with\nBalinese-inspired totem lamps made of bamboo and capped with wild grasses.\n\n\nI, too, was tempted to share some ideas with her, but lunch came all\ntoo soon and with it, the frenzy of a working afternoon shooting other\ngardens before heading back to Manila.\n\n\nIt was during this lunch where I noticed the exact purpose of the\ngarden. \n\n \n\nAmid the buildings and the outhouses lay a large brick oven.\n\n\nConstructed by a specialist that does this type of ovens\nspecifically for  pan de sal  , this huge oven is the\nhearth of most of the gatherings that take place in the open spaces.\n\n\nFrom this oven roast, meats and vegetables, breads and especially\ndelicious pizzas emerge. \n\n \n\nAnother interesting fact from our \" non-gardener &rdquo;\nis that Georgie has now taken to the art of making compost, something she has\nlearned from Gretchen O. Cojuangco, who is her sister 's mother-in-law.\n\n\nIt is a practical and completely pro-ecological exercise, which she\nencourages everyone to do.\n\n\nSo much from one who simply won't admit she is, deep at heart, a\ngardener in her own right. \n\n\n The recipes: \n\n\n  3  Formagio  Pizza  \n\n\nEqual amounts of:\n\n\n Gorgonzola \n\n\n Bel paese \n\n\n Mozzarella ( di buffala)  cheeses\n\n\nPizza dough ( store-bought or homemade)\n\n\nGenerous sprinkling of olive oil\n\n \n\nBrush pizza dough with olive oil, sprinkle equal amounts of\ncheeses on the dough, dribble olive oil over cheese and bake in a very hot\noven for 10 minutes.\n\n\nIn her brick oven the pizza is done in 2 minutes. \n\n\n  Compost  \n\n\nAll fruit and vegetables peels and rinds\n\n\nFoodstuff excess like egg shells, used coffee ground and teas\n\n\nDry leaves and twigs broken into small pieces\n\n\nGrass cuttings\n\n \n\nMix all of the above in quantities that your compost pit can\nhold.\n\n\n( Do not place food like meats, meat bones and rice.)\n\n\nCover the mixture with a little garden soil.\n\n\nMake sure your compost pit can be covered from excess moisture as\nthis will ruin your compost.\n\n\nCover and leave for a week before turning.\n\n\nContinue adding grass cuttings once a week and in six weeks your\ntrash will now be excellent compost.\n\n\nA remarkable percentage of your garbage is new environmentally\nrecycled without burning or dumping.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a3ae98f3-8d3f-42a7-a6cd-4c5846a3f374", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.314066+00:00"}
{"text": "Wrap your imagination  \n\n\n Marge C. Enriquez \n\n \n\n THE WAY  you wrap gifts actually increases their\nvalue.\n\n\nBut you don't have to spend &peso;200 to buy a box and trimmings. \n\n \n\nAll you need is imagination, says Rachy Cuna, Metropolitan Museum\nconsultant.\n\n\nForget cellophane and silk satin ribbons.\n\n\n  Sinamay   is the in thing for wrapping\ngifts, whether the material is used as wrapper or ribbon. \n\n \n\nDivisoria is Cuna 's favorite source of materials--for pines,\nbaskets, lace, bells, fans, birds, ribbons, miniature wheels, miniature\n  bayong   ,   sinamay   in\nbright colors or with metallic threads, boa feathers, miniature fruits and\nflowers, beads and  faux  pearls. \n\n \n\nA blow gun and glue pellets, available in hardware and craft\nstores, are also needed. \n\n \n\nThe hardware section also offers nontraditional wrappers such as\ncolored screens which make nifty wrappers.\n\n\nAsk friends who do wallpaper to give you remnants. \n\n \n\nFor drama, if you 're attending a big function where you have to\nlug your gifts, wrap them up in the same color and wear an outfit that\nmatches it. \n\n \n\nIt 's fun to wrap the presents according to the receiver 's\npersonality, says Cuna. \n\n \n\nTie a   tampipi   with dried water lily\nstalks instead of the usual ribbon.\n\n\nAdd plastic cranberries as accents.\n\n\nA red   tampipi   goes well with a \ncapiz  star. \n\n \n\nFor the person who loves to cook, wrap braided garlic in gold\ntinsel and use a tulle veil as dramatic accent.\n\n\nBraided garlic also looks good with a red feather boa wound on top,\naccented by gold tinsel. \n\n \n\n  Queso de bola   can be wrapped with\nglazed paper, and studded with anise stars. \n\n \n\nFruitcakes can be packaged in little   bayong \n . \n\n \n\nHighlight a cookbook by adorning the wrapper with dried bay\nleaves. \n\n \n\nTo pack local  delicatessen  such as special\nrice, put it in a dried gourd flask, available in Baguio, and accessorize\nwith gold   sinamay   ribbon.\n\n\nAdd dried   palay   stalks for accent. \n\n \n\n  Itlog na maalat   can be packaged in an\n abaca   fez  and wrapped with tulle and\nhandmade ribbon with tiny Christmas balls. \n\n \n\nCuna gives his vegetarian friends boxes adorned with fresh\nchillies or garden vegetables. \n\n \n\nFor the sweet tooth, pack cookies and cakes in  \nsinamay   boxes.\n\n\nTop them with surplus Christmas decor such as   sinamay\n  angels, or put them in bird cages tied up with copper wire.\n\n\n \n\nFor the nun or grandmother, get a  celadon \nglazed vase with lilies and Australian wild grass.\n\n\nTie dyed raffia around the vase and finish with gold berries. \n\n \n\nThe contents of Filipiniana gifts can be highlighted with\nhandmade paper.\n\n\nUse a blowgun to spread feathers around it, or paste  abaca\n stars on it and tie with a gold chain. \n\n \n\nFor the traditional woman, use a grass box and enliven it with a\nminiature poinsettia and gold ribbon. \n\n \n\nSmall bamboo steamers make interesting jewel boxes.\n\n\nTie them up with gold tinsel and add an  abaca  star.\n\n\nOr, get a   bayong   and dot it with red\nballs and wrap it with hollies. \n\n \n\nFor the sophisticated woman, put the gift in a large bowl and\ncover the bowl with pink and magenta tulle.\n\n\nTie the ends of the tulle and catch them with gold pine, cypress and\n  agoho   .\n\n\nFor accent, cover with gold beads. \n\n \n\nFor someone sweet, wrap the gift in pastel paper and paste a\nspiral out of handmade paper ribbon.\n\n\nAdd a dash of fresh flowers. \n\n \n\nThere are many ways to package liquors.\n\n\nYou can put them in cylindrical baskets found in trade fairs and wrap\nthem with  coco  leaf ribbons, gold wire and gold poinsettia.\n\n\n \n\nFor the yuppie, use the rubber mat for draining dishes to wrap\nthe liquor bottle and tie it up with electrical wire. \n\n \n\nAn  abaca  doormat in strong colors is suitable\nfor wine bottles.\n\n\nTie them up with tinsel. \n\n \n\nFor the child, use a   moras   teddy\nbear, available in Divisoria, instead of a ribbon. \n\n \n\nFor the boss, wrap your gift in mottled handmade paper and cover\nwith gilt   sinamay   .\n\n\nOr, use plain  abaca  as the second wrapper and accent\nit with dried twigs.  \n\n\n\n\n  Look around, then choose your line of small enterprise\n \n\n\n Dennis M. Arroyo  \n\n\n THERE 'S  this exemplary taxi driver I read about\nsomewhere.\n\n\nHe 's dressed impeccably like a true professional.\n\n\nThe interior of the cab is sparkling.\n\n\nWhen you get in, he offers you a choice of newspaper to read.\n\n\nEven some soft drinks--and they are all free.\n\n\nThen when you reach your destination, he opens the door for you. \n\n \n\nHow can he afford the free newspaper and the drinks?\n\n\nThe guy makes a killing on tips.\n\n\nNow that 's an example of excellence in a small business.\n\n\nIt was all superbly planned. \n\n \n\nThis article will provide some advice for those venturing out on\ntheir own small enterprises.\n\n\nWe start with how to choose your particular business.\n\n\nThe principles were largely drawn from a book by the Small\nEnterprises Research & Development Foundation. \n\n \n\nTo start, what is your general line of business? \n\n \n\nYou may want to go into manufacturing products.\n\n\nThese may be for the mass market or for specialized demand.\n\n\nMass goods include items like T-shirts and bottled water.\n\n\nSpecialized products may be those that cater to doctors, dentists,\nlawyers, journalists.\n\n\nImagine the fortune to be made by a pocket laser that can change the\ntraffic light. \n\n \n\nYou may want the process industries.\n\n\nThat is, you handle one or two stages of the entire manufacturing\nprocess, not the entire chain.\n\n\nFor example, you can focus on cutting, welding or milling.\n\n\nOr you may want to handle packaging and canning. \n\n \n\nAnother option is to be a subcontractor.\n\n\nLarge companies subcontract specialized work to the smaller fry\npartly because their capacity is much too big for the task.\n\n\nOr they do not have the expertise for such activities.\n\n\nIt may also be faster and cheaper for them to delegate that work.\n\n\nHowever, there is a danger of becoming too dependent on one major\nclient. \n\n \n\nThen another viable option is to go into services.\n\n\nThere are more service enterprises among the small industries than\nmanufacturing outfits.\n\n\nMany services can be conducted from the home, and they appeal to\ntalented types. \n\n \n\nThe major fuel is creativity.\n\n\nFor example, a high school senior may have a part-time job talking to\nteens to find out what 's in and out fashion-wise.\n\n\nThe information will prove useful for department stores. \n\n \n\nServices have been stereotyped as being performed by individuals\nfor individuals.\n\n\nThat is not necessarily so.\n\n\nThrough technology, machines get to serve customers with minimum\nhuman contact.\n\n\n( Think of the ATMs, notwithstanding jokes about the hidden midgets.)\n\n\n\n  Generating business ideas  \n\n \n\nThen, how do you get many ideas for your enterprise? \n\n \n\nFirst ask what skills you have picked up with experience.\n\n\nMany times have small businesses emerged from talents developed in\nprevious jobs.\n\n\nExecutives have often ventured into management consultancy as a\nresult of accumulated years in the office. \n\n \n\nThen again, you may excel in a particular passion or hobby\nunrelated to your former jobs.\n\n\nIf you feel you are the authority on research via the Internet, you\nmay want to cash in on that skill. \n\n \n\nAnother tack is to look at the data on imports.\n\n\nWhat goods does the Philippines still import which can be\nmanufactured locally?\n\n\nIf you can produce them at lower cost then you have quite an edge.\n\n\nDevaluation has made imports more prohibitive and the trend may last\nlong.\n\n\nBesides, you can always alter your product to make it more suitable\nto local demand.\n\n\nForeign manufacturers can't easily do this. \n\n \n\nA third way is to read up on new technologies.\n\n\nCheck them out in \" TIME \" , \" Newsweek\n\" , or \" Discover \" magazine.\n\n\nBetter yet, use the Internet 's search engine for getting the latest\ntechnologies.\n\n\nYou can be the first to introduce a particular technology here, and\nthat translates into a temporary monopoly advantage. \n\n \n\nFourth, take a look of the product lines encouraged in the\nlatest official investment priorities plan.\n\n\nThese are often pioneer areas or those with few producers competing\namong themselves. \n\n \n\nFifth, check social trends.\n\n\nIf reading the business pages won't suffice, you may want to look at\nofficial data, or those of \" Social Weather Stations \" .\n\n\nFor example, Metro Manila traffic will get heavier before it is\nrelieved by the new light rail transit.\n\n\nWhat products will ease the purgatory of the daily driver or\ncommuter? \n\n \n\nIncidentally, enterprising Indonesians cashed in on a traffic\nordinance that there must be more than one person in a car.\n\n\nStreet children would look for cars with solo drivers then get money\nfor hitching with them. \n\n \n\nA sixth way is simply to have a brainstorming session with your\nfriends.\n\n\nOver a round of beer, get their opinions on what new services can\narise.\n\n\nWhat needs have not been met?\n\n\nHow can some current products and services be improved? \n\n \n\nWild but viable ideas may arise.\n\n\nIn the US, some actors hire themselves out to supermarkets.\n\n\nThey pretend to shoplift, are \" caught &rdquo; by the security\nguards, and hauled away.\n\n\nThe commotion and embarrassment deter would-be shoplifters. \n\n \n\nWhat are the capital requirements?\n\n\nIf the needed funding is the size of Godzilla, then think twice.\n\n\nThe size of the loan does matter in these days of high interest\nrates. \n\n \n\nWhat is the rate of return on investment?\n\n\nSome enterprises may yield such meager fruit that they may not be\nworth the effort. \n\n \n\nDo you really have the training and liking for the project?\n\n\nIf it 's far from your heart, you will eventually slacken and the\nbusiness may go belly-up. \n\n\n  Planned expansion  \n\n \n\nThen dream about the growth of the business. \n\n \n\nAsk: How will the business be a year from now?\n\n\nThe targets should be specific, measurable, attainable.\n\n\nFor example, you may want your risk analysis consultancy to make\n&peso;70,000 a month.\n\n\nOr you want your Thai cuisine catering service to open a small\nrestaurant.\n\n\nOr you want to increase the income from your cell phone repair\nservice by 25 percent. \n\n \n\nAsk: What changes do you see in your industry, and how should\nyou prepare for them?

{"text": "Ex-ADB exec has a way with weird plants, interesting\nsucculents  \n\n\n Serapion S. Metilla \n\n \n\nIAN Hay, a plant hobbyist focusing on weird and unusual plants, is\nprobably one of the happiest persons in the world.\n\n\nThis bachelor from Australia, who was with Asian Development Bank here\nfor about 18 years, also collects orchids,  bonsai  ,\nbromeliads and other ornamentals, apart from cacti and other succulents. \n\n \n\nAn active member of the Cactus and Succulent Society of the\nPhilippines which this writer founded in 1978 and is now headed by Mely Ileto\nSibayan, he has a most impressive collection--succulents ranging from cacti,\n euphorbias  , some  crassulas  to the\nsucculent members of the  Apocynaceae  , \nAsclepiadaceae  ,  Compositae  , \nLiliaceae  and  Portulacariaceae  families among\nothers. \n\n \n\nOne of the unusual succulents is the   Monedenium\nguentherii var. mammillarii   .\n\n\nBelonging to the  Euphorbiaceae  family, this plant\noriginated in the arid regions of M'balu mountains in East Africa.\n\n\nIt bears few oblanceolate leaves around the apex and fall off in about\na month. \n\n \n\nIts manner of growth is prostrate--it crawls and eventually\nbecomes pendulous.\n\n\nAlthough the plants remind you of large worms, to the plant\ncollectors, they look very fascinating. \n\n \n\nOther favorites of Ian are the crested forms.\n\n\nCrestation is a result of mutation or sport, showing something\ndifferent from the normal or original.\n\n\nThe change in form, say from a normal columnar to a shape like that\nof a rooster 's crown or crest ( cockscomb), the mutation is called \"\ncrestate \" or \" crestation \" . \n\n \n\nIt looks weird like a pile of bloated and curling worms but to\navid collectors it 's a form of art which they enjoy. \n\n \n\nSome of Mr. Hay 's specimens were the   Notocactus\nscopa cristata   ,   Mammillaria vaupelii\ncristata   ,   Mammillaria elonzata cristata\n  ,   Chamaecereus silvestrii crassicaulis\ncristatus   ,   Nyctocereus serpentinus cristatus\n  ,   Opuntia vestita cristata   ,\n  Cephalocereus chrysacanthus cristatus   and\nsome varieties of  euphorbias  such as the  \nE. neriifolia cristata, E. lactea cristata variegata, E. nerrifolia cristata\nvariegata   , among others. \n\n \n\nThe other forms of mutations are the variegations and\nmonstrosities.\n\n\nPlants showing discoloration or pigmentaton, meaning having white or\nyellow spots or splashes is termed \" variegation \" and\nplants deviating from its normal form as to size and irregularity but not\ncrestate, are considered monstrous. \n\n \n\nMonstrous and variegated forms are curiosities that cacti and\nsucculent hobbyists like to collect. \n\n \n\n Caudiciforms  are also Ian Hay 's weaknesses.\n\n\nThese are plants with enlarged bases, usually rounded, including both\nstem and root called \" caudex \" . \n\n \n\nAmong his caudiciform collections are some types of \nJatrophas  called \" gout plants \" , \nDorstenias  and  Beaucarnea recurvata  . \n\n \n\nThe   gabi   and   ubi \n are some examples of caudiciforms.\n\n\nThese plants, however, are not included among his collection because\nthey are very common and you can see them in the markets.\n\n\nThey are not rare or unusual. \n\n \n\nSome plants are also horrible-looking.\n\n\nHe has a plant named   Euphorbia hirroda \n because of its horrible spines and   Ferrocactus\n  , so named because of its ferocious spines. \n\n \n\nBecause of its likeness to the white hairs of an old man, the\nepithet of a certain cactus is \"  senilis \n\" - - scientifically called   Cephalocereus senilis\n  .\n\n\nThis is a globular type of plant fully covered with long white hairs.\n\n\n \n\nThe   Nyctocereus serpentinus   has a\nserpentlike form; the   Astrrophytum capricorne  \nfor its goat-hornedlike spines and the   Faucaria tigrina \n for its leaves which are tigerlike in appearance. \n\n\n  Care and propagation  \n\n \n\nHow do you take care of weird plants and curiosities?\n\n\nBeing mutant, they are quite delicate.\n\n\nUsually, they don't grow as fast as the normal ones most especially\nthe variegated and the fully colored types such as the reds, yellows, pinks\nand lavanders.\n\n\nThe pigmentation or discoloration shows lack of chlorophyll. \n\n \n\nChlorophyll, according to scientists, is the green-coloring\nmatter of plants that helps in the manufacture of food for its growth and\ndevelopment of stems, leaves, branches and all other parts.\n\n\nThe fully colored ones have no chlorophyll and, therefore, cannot\nmanufacture their own food. \n\n \n\nIn this case, they have to be grafted to another cactus of the\nhardy type with sufficient chlorophyll that can tolerate any type of soil and\nthrives in both temperate and tropical climate.\n\n\nIt is the stock then that can provide food for the scion. \n\n \n\nHowever, not just any other cactus can be used as stock but one\nthat has affinity or compatibility to each other.\n\n\nThe stocks usually used are the   Hylocereus undatus\n  ,   Myrtillocactus geometrizanus \n ,   Cephalocereus sp.   and \n Lemaereocereus beneckei   , among others. \n\n \n\nAs to potting medium, a mixture of one-part river sand, one-part\ngarden soil preferably the loam type and two parts compost will do.\n\n\nWatering must be done only about once a week or when the medium is\ndry. \n\n \n\nPlace your plants in a well-lighted position but only about 60 to\n70 percent sunlight.\n\n\nThis means not the direct scorching sun.\n\n\nSee to it that the place gets sufficient air circulation.\n\n\nIn areas where rains occur in longer periods night and day, house\nyour succulent collection with transparent plastic roofing. \n\n \n\nIn humid and damp areas where fungus is likely to attack, apply\nat least once a week with fungicide and insecticide if scales or mealy bugs\nare present.  \n\n\n\n\n   'Tikog'  industry gets a boost \n\n\n\n Serapion S. Metilla \n\n \n\n  TIKOG   industry has been one of the\noldest folk handicrafts of the Visayans, particularly of Leyte and Samar, and\nsome of the tribes of Mindanao.\n\n\nBut because the   tikog   plant, which grows\nwild in open fresh-water marshlands, was never cultured scientifically, the\n  tikog   handicrafts seem to be dwindling, as\nweavers depend only on the availability of material provided by nature. \n\n \n\n\"   Tikog   \" , Visayan\nname for a water grass belonging to the  Cyperaceae \nfamily, scientifically called \"  Fimbristylis globusa (\nRetz.) Kunth  \" , is a tufted plant with fibrous roots,\nhaving terminal inflorescences, with a simple or compound umbellate reduced\nto a single spikelet.\n\n\nCalled \"   sud-sod   \" among\nthe natives of Bukidnon, it grows from 5 to 5 1/2 feet tall, with stems of\nabout 1/3 centimeter in diameter and almost uniform all the way up. \n\n \n\nThe plant can be harvested when the inflorescences have fully\nopened, somewhat dark brown in appearance with the stem turning dull green.\n\n\nThe harvested plants are then treated by hanging to air-dry for about\na week in a   kamalig   - type house.\n\n\nSun-drying is not advisable because they become brittle. \n\n \n\nWhen fully dried, somewhat light brown in color, they are ready\nfor using.\n\n\nA few minutes before using, though, a bundle should be moistened to\nenhance its pliancy.\n\n\nFor coloring, a special type of dye good for grass material is used.\n\n\n \n\nWith the ethnobotanical studies he conducted among the Tala-andig\ntribe in  Barangay  Songco, Lantapan, Bukidnon, scientist IV\nand National Museum chief botanist Romualdo M. del Rosario found out that\n  tikog   and a type of bamboo locally called\n\"   bagtok   \" grow well in the\nvicinity.\n\n\nSome in the community were into weaving, but not as an industry,\nprobably because of the lack of incentives. \n\n \n\nThe Tala-andigs live about 37 kilometers west of Malaybalay,\nBukidnon 's capital.\n\n\nLocated at the foot of Mt. Kitanlad, the place has a very mild\nclimate. \n\n \n\nDel Rosario recommended the culture of   tikog \n and   bagtok   to boost the community 's\nweaving industry.\n\n\nWith the financial support of the Philippine Council for Agriculture,\nForestry, Research and Development ( PCAFRD), the project is now ongoing.\n\n\nBecause weaving can be easily done in the home, this promises to be a\npotential moneymaker which can be of great help to this poor community. \n\n\n  How to culture   tikog   \n\n\n \n\nIn his experiments with the culture of   tikog \n , Herminio Pava, professor VI of Central Mindanao University in\nMusuan, Bukidnon, recommends the following:\n\n\n*Planting distance should be at least 8 &rdquo; to 10 &rdquo; away\nfrom each other.\n\n\n*Water supply should be constant, at least 2 &rdquo; above the soil\nlevel.\n\n\n*Fertilizer application, preferably the organic type, should be done\nat least once a month.\n\n\n*Sunlight should be full, at least eight hours a day.\n\n\n*Weeding of foreign grasses should be regularly observed.\n\n\n*When 70 percent of the plant is matured, it is ready for harvesting.\n\n\n \n\nWith the aim of promoting the   tikog  \nindustry for the export market, a seminar-workshop with weaving hands-on\namong the Tala-andigs was conducted two months ago.\n\n\nThe idea, according to Del Rosario, is not only to improve the\nquality of workmanship and design but most of all to retain the handicrafts '\nethnic character.\n\n\nUsing the   tulugan   ( center for their\nactivities), the women do the weaving of mats, hats, baskets, bags, while the\nmen tend the farming of   tikog   with their corn,\nvegetables, rice. \n\n \n\nHeading the tribal community is Adolino Saway ( with the title\n Datu  Makapukaw) as overall chieftain, assisted by his\nyounger brother Victorino (  Datu  Migketay) as\nadministrator of the Tala-andig development projects.\n\n\nThey are thankful for the assistance the government is giving, which\nthey hope will be consistent.  \n\n\n\n\n  Have &peso;200,000, can join the  tiangge \nband  \n\n\n Nancy C. Carvajal \n\n \n\nWITH a space of only 1.5 square meters, a capital of\n&peso;200,000, plus a steady dose of drive and determination and a lot of\nimagination, you can earn as much as &peso;20,000 to 30,000 a month. \n\n \n\nThe tiny area is known as exhibit space or   tiangge\n  and can be rented on the ground floor or corridors of malls\nlike the Makati Cinema Square. \n\n \n\nIt is perfect for starting an RTW stall. \n\n \n\nTo be an exhibitor, you will need a business permit from the\nDepartment of Trade and Industry and a  barangay  permit.\n\n\nThe rent varies with the location and position of the booth, usually\non the ground floor and corridors of malls. \n\n \n\nIf a booth has two sides--open on two sides--then the rent is\nhigher. \n\n \n\nThe rent ranges from &peso;15,000 to &peso;50,000 a month.\n\n\nA rental contract is usually renewable every three months. \n\n \n\nSome malls raise the rates by a certain percentage each time the\ncontract is renewed.\n\n\nThen they go back to the original rate at the start of the calendar\nyear. \n\n \n\nEven during lean periods, a booth is known to make about\n&peso;6,000 a day. \n\n \n\nA  tiangge  generally sells imported\nready-to-wear, imported blouses, skirts, pants, shorts, blazers--in all kinds\nof materials, from velvet, gabardine and silk, to linen, cotton, leather and\nothers. \n\n \n\nA fashion sense and an eye for good material are important\nfactors in this kind of venture. \n\n \n\nStall owners who have a bigger capital regularly travel to Hong\nKong, Bangkok or South Korea as   viajeras   to\nbuy goods, and to earn higher profit. \n\n \n\nIf you have limited capital, you can buy your merchandise from\nfull-time   viajeras   , a number of whom can be\nfound in Baclaran and Divisoria.\n\n\nMany   viajeras   sell their merchandise\nin their own homes. \n\n \n\nIn choosing the RTW items, for example, to sell, it is suggested\nthat you get at least three colors of each style, and half a dozen of each\ncolor.\n\n\n\" Leftovers &rdquo; can be repackaged and sold at a lower\nprice. \n\n \n\nThe lobbies and corridors of malls and big buildings that have\nregular heavy human traffic are ideal sites for exhibits.\n\n\nParks are now also being used as exhibit locations. \n\n \n\nAccording to Jackie Collins, who has been an exhibitor for eight\nyears now,  \" A lot of hard work and patience is needed in this\nkind of business.\n\n\nYou have to be persuasive, on top of having good quality stuff, so\nthat the clientele will keep coming back.\n\n\nSometimes, you act as their fashion consultant and you have to be\nsincere and honest about it. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nExhibitors should also be always updated on the latest in\nfashion.\n\n\nReading magazines and other materials can help you keep pace with\nthe latest and replenish your supply accordingly. \n\n \n\nThe display of the merchandise is also an important factor in\nattracting buyers.\n\n\nThe items put on display must be the best and the latest styles from\nyour stocks.\n\n\nHave enough commodities for the buyers to choose from. \n\n \n\nDisplays should be changed or rearranged everyday, so that\ncustomers get a new perspective when they come back. \n\n \n\nFor the display, you will need plenty of hangers, racks and even\nmannequins.\n\n\nThe racks should be small, to fit into the limited booth space.\n\n\nA rack that can carry 40-45 blouses costs &peso;1,000. \n\n \n\nHangers cost about &peso;25 a dozen.\n\n\nMannequins for blouses cost &peso;120 a piece, for pants, &peso;180.\n\n\n \n\nA whole-body mirror with good reflection and a fitting room are\nalso needed.\n\n\nIf there is still space, shelves can be a useful addition. \n\n \n\nUsually, only one or two people are needed to man the booth.\n\n\nIt is also important to train them so that they have a better chance\nof making a sale.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a58b1bd7-8db2-4842-bc98-051525c4b24b", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.317067+00:00"}
{"text": "Art of buying a Turkish carpet  \n\n\n Christine O. Cunanan \n\n \n\n ISTANBUL  - -\n\n\nBuying a Turkish carpet is like choosing a marriage partner.\n\n\nYou take one for life so it 's important to choose well.\n\n\nAnd as you and your carpet grow old together, the handcrafted artwork\nwill develop a special luster that upstart, brand new and possibly - - horror\nof horrors! - - machine-made carpets can never equal. \n\n \n\nA real Turkish carpet  connoisseur  has no\ninterest in new carpets straight from the weaving looms in an Anatolyan\nmountain village last week - - unless he wishes to gift his just-born\ngrandson with a legacy that will only realize its true value by the time the\ngrandson is ready to become a grandfather. \n\n  \" Only the tourist and the   nouveau riche\n  look at new carpets, &rdquo;  says one such\n connoisseur  named Berti, who runs a water pipe shop in\nIstanbul, rather condescendingly.\n\n\n \" They don't know any better. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nBerti 's passions are the antique - - the older, the better - -\ncarpets that lost generations of mothers and aunts once patiently wove on\ntheir living room floors to alleviate boredom during long winters.\n\n\nThese carpets ' intricate patterns can never be exactly woven again\nbecause the contemporary Turkish village woman 's patience for manual work\nhas run thin.\n\n\nTelevision, radio, and even satellite programming beckon, as well as\nthe lures of big city life. \n\n\n  Proof of skills  \n\n \n\nThese days, a 5 x 5-knot wool and cotton   Kayseri\n  ( named after a weaving region in Central Turkey) carpet is\na proof of skill, while the 6 x 6-knot carpets of yesteryears is considered\nmartyrdom. \n\n \n\n \" They don't make carpets like these anymore,\n&rdquo;  says Achmed, who is Berti 's cousin and a fourth generation\ncarpet dealer, as he spreads a 50-year old floor rug woven in the designs of\nthe royal Topkapi Palace on the floor of his tiny stall adjacent to Istanbul 's\nCovered Bazaar. \n\n \n\nAntique carpets are also purchased as investments by shrewd art\ncollectors. \n\n \n\n \" Knots as tightly woven as these are things of the\npast, which is why we can sell old ones at a premium, &rdquo; \ncontinues Achmed.\n\n\n \" I guess the trend will continue, too, and it will\nbecome more and more difficult and expensive to handweave.\n\n\nIf you buy a good handwoven carpet from me now, for instance, I will\nprobably buy it back at double the price in ten years. &rdquo;  \n\n\n  Family heirlooms  \n\n \n\nFor most carpet lovers, however, Turkish carpets are simply\nfamily heirlooms awarded a prominent place in the living room, where guests\ncan admire the design in its entirety and the handwork in detail.\n\n\nThe more it is used in daily life, the shinier the wool, the more\nvivid the colors. \n\n \n\nThe child 's muddy footprints,  shish kebab \nsauce spills, and overturned cups of apple tea have all become part of the\ncarpet - - adding character and family stories to a once lifeless piece. \n\n \n\n \" I have no treasures to speak of, &rdquo; \nsays Mehti, owner of a small hotel in the tourist town of Urgup in Central\nTurkey,  \" except for my carpets, which have been with us for\ngenerations and are priceless. &rdquo; \n\n\nAnd indeed, his family 's collection of over 300 old Turkish carpets\ncolor the walls and floors of his otherwise nondescript hotel in the midst of\na dusty plain. \n\n \n\nWhile the joys of owning a fine Turkish carpet are universally\nacknowledged, however, the pleasures of the all-important search have yet to\nbe properly revealed. \n\n \n\nSuch an acquisition merits more than a perfunctory visit to the\nnearest carpet store or a harassed decision during the only free afternoon on\na package tour.\n\n\nThe search takes time and should be enjoyed at leisure, if only for\nthe momentary illusions it provides of a past era. \n\n\n  Carpet search  \n\n \n\nSerious carpet enthusiasts must begin their search with\nnon-committal visits to the typical tourist carpet haunts in downtown\nIstanbul where the products are mediocre and the prices extravagant.\n\n\nOver refills of strong local coffee and apple tea, shopkeepers will\ncheerfully provide adequate crash courses on spotting good carpets and\nindustry lingo - - information necessary for the second stage of the search.\n\n\n \n\nWhen one has acquired enough information to confidently spot a\nwool-on-wool carpet and tell the difference between a \" Kayseri\n\" and a \" Herieke \" , then one is probably ready\nfor the actual purchase. \n\n \n\n Connoisseurs  maintain that the best carpet\nfinds at still reasonable prices await clients at the various weaving regions\naround the country, away from Istanbul 's tourist traps. \n\n \n\nThe semi-government cooperative Oz-Ay Carpet, Tourism, Industry &\nTrade Co., Inc. in the Capaddocia region, is one such center.\n\n\nReaching it is no easy feat, requiring an hour 's flight from\nIstanbul to the city of Kayseri and then a two-and-a-half drive through the\nmountains to Urgup town. \n\n \n\n  Queen of carpets  \n\n \n\nAt the cooperative, carpets are housed in special buildings\naccording to categories: 100% wool, wool-woven-on-cotton frames, and 100%\nsilk.\n\n\nThe 100% silk Herieke carpets, lusted after by  connoisseurs\n as the queen of all Turkish carpets, are kept in a small,\ndimly-lit room imbued with a mysterious aroma. \n\n \n\nUpon arrival, the client is made to sit in the place of honor in\na cavernous room filled from ceiling to ceiling with carpets.\n\n\nThe selection session begins with wine and local appetizers while the\ncarpet master discourses on the region, the cooperative and Turkish carpets.\n\n\n \n\nOnce the client 's preferences have been determined, assistants\nbegin coming out from the sidelines and rapidly unfurling dozens of carpets\nbefore the astonished client while the master churns out a little story on\neach.\n\n\nThe effect is pure magic.\n\n\nThe client is breathless in a sea of tales, colors and designs,\ncompelled to purchase as many as the credit card can accommodate. \n\n \n\nThe initial screening takes place effortlessly, although the\nfinal decision may take a long time.\n\n\nThe client is subtly wooed with more wine and less talk, as the staff\nrespectfully maintain their distance and silence.\n\n\nThis is, after all, a place for  connoisseurs \nrather than souvenir-hunting tourists so pressure-selling is avoided.\n\n\nThe  connoisseur  , after all, knows the carpet 's\nvalue and needs no encouragement to appreciate. \n\n\n  Final negotiations  \n\n \n\nAt the client 's request, the chosen carpets - - like fine\npaintings - - are tested under different kinds of light and sunlight.\n\n\nShould all conditions be satisfactory, final negotiations discreetly\ntake place and the transaction is consummated with the flourish of a gold\npen. \n\n \n\nThe client finally sets out into the golden Cappadocian plain\nbereft of thousands of dollars, if not tens of thousands of dollars.\n\n\nYet the experience proves unforgettable and one happily discovers\nthat one is hooked on Turkey and Turkish carpets for life.\n\n\nThe living room is never the same again either. \n\n \n\nWhen the early morning sun filters in, giving the carpet a soft\npastel hue, you can almost imagine the famed Blue  Mosque \noutside your window and Mehti coming in with a cup of apple tea.  \n\n\n\n\n  African violets are now so in  \n\n\n  For a time, they were 'out'.\n\n\nThey 're making a comeback - - in new colors and shapes.  \n\n\n Marietta V. Giron \n\n \n\n QUITE  delicate and demanding of time and\nattention, African Violets faded out of the scene for sometime.\n\n\nBut some dedicated fanciers managed to grow them over the years, and\nthey 're excited that the plants are back, this time in an array of new\ncolors and shapes. \n\n \n\n \" I haven't stopped growing African violets.\n\n\nI just stopped adding on because people here stopped selling them,\n&rdquo;  said Adelaida Almazar, an avid African Violet ( AV) hobbyist\nof over 20 years. \n\n \n\n \" Some of my violets have been around for years and\nthey 're just as lovely as the new hybrids.\n\n\nI 've passed them on to my daughter Maricel, &rdquo;  said\nAlicia Javier, former president of the African Violet Society of the\nPhilippines. \n\n \n\nThe AVs lure men as well. \n\n \n\nThe women say they love them for the company and the amount of\nfuss they can shower the demanding plants.\n\n\nThe men claim they grow the AVs for the challenge and the variety of\nexperiments they can do. \n\n \n\nHorticulturist Danny Tiu tries them in different soil-less\npotting mix he has formulated out of pasteurized coconut fiber, coffee hull,\nand rice husk. \n\n \n\nAgriculturist Ray Ong propagates the plants by  \"\nchopping them. &rdquo; \n\n\nBy this , he means taking leaf cuttings that will produce baby AVs\nwhen rooted in a propagating bed. \n\n \n\n \" Cut off mature leaves with their stalks and plant\nthem in moist sand or small grade of Mt. Pinatubo 's pumice.\n\n\nIn one month, each leaf cutting will produce young plants.\n\n\nFrom one mother plant, you can produce easily a dozen plants.\n\n\nAVs can be a source of extra income,\"  he advises. \n\n \n\nYoung plants can be sold at &peso;30 each, and a blooming plant,\nif it is a new hybrid, at &peso;200.\n\n\nThey can be sold in the neighborhood or consigned with shop owners in\nthe plant markets, according to Ong. \n\n \n\nVic Chin, a recent convert of AVs, says he collects the plants\nbecause of the challenge and their commercial value. \n\n \n\n \" They 're not so expensive like the orchids and\nbulb plants, but they 're saleable enough these days. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nChin, a graduate of University of the Philippines Los\nBa&ntilde;os, is one of the newbreed horticulturists.\n\n\nHe propagates and sells pot plants in greenhouses at the back of the\nfamily restaurant called \" Dinghao \" .\n\n\nHe has lilies, gerberas, spice plants, fancy hibiscus, bromeliads,\nand other imported hybrids. \n\n \n\nAmong the experiments he does after his chores in the restaurant\non Calamba highway is finding the right soil mix and fertilizer formula for\nthe AVs. \n\n \n\n \" Like orchids and lilies, the AVs need very clean\npotting mix, a well-balanced plant food, filtered sunlight, good air\ncirculation and sufficient water. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nTo make sure it 's humid enough and well-circulated in his\ngreenhouse, he had installed electric fans and sprinkles that are switched on\nwhen it gets too hot and dry. \n\n \n\nGrowers Adelaida Almazar and Alice Javier grow their African\nViolets on raised benches in the backyard.\n\n\nOverhead the benches are several layers of fishnet that screen the\nplants from direct sunlight. \n\n \n\nJavier 's special potting recipe for her AVs uses chopped tree\nfern roots, fine river sand, dried manure and garden soil.\n\n\nThese are moistened and \" cooked &rdquo; over fire.\n\n\nBy the time the soil is dry, all the harmful micro-organisms are\nbelieved to be dead. \n\n \n\nAlmazar uses different combinations of potting ingredients which\ninclude Canadian peat moss, perlite, sawdust with horse manure from the race\ntracks, tree fern chips,  coir  dust,  etc.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nBoth admit they 're hooked on AVs for life.\n\n\n \" It 's hard to stop growing them once you know the\ntrick to it. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThey 've managed all these years to keep some of the old\nvarieties - - like the \" Elfried \" , \" Serenity\n\" , and \" Victoria Reginae \" - - by patiently\npropagating the plants through leaf cuttings. \n\n \n\nThey do it two ways.\n\n\nOne is by rooting the leaf stems in a dish of water.\n\n\nWhen the roots are out and baby plants are forming, the leaves are\nplaced on top of moist sand where the new baby plants will get established.\n\n\nThe other way is to plant the stems directly in moist sand or\nperlite. \n\n \n\n \" AVs need a lot of fussing over, and they seem to\ngrow best when they 're touched and fondled, &rdquo;  Almazar says.\n\n\n \n\nThe AV fanciers have one thing in common.\n\n\nThey cannot get their hands off the plants.  \n\n\n\n\n  Birdwatchers flock together  \n\n\n Maria Congee S.

{"text": "Surf 's up  \n\n\n By Danny Maramba \n\n \n\n SURFING  , also known as \" surfboard riding\n\" , is a popular aquatic activity in many parts of the world where\nwaves go wild and peak very high.\n\n\nIt is the act of riding on waves as these break over a shallow\nshoreline. \n\n \n\n\" Body surfing \" is the simplest form of this\nsport where a surfer swims onto a wave and rides it to shore.\n\n\nLying, kneeling, or standing on a surfboard are the other known ways\nof surfing.\n\n\nSince the 1960s, the popularity of surfing as a sport and pastime has\ngrown because it requires no formal training and can be enjoyed virtually\nanywhere when waves break.\n\n\nNevertheless, if your aim is to eventually compete, you have to train\nwith the pros at open-ocean coastline surfing sites. \n\n \n\nNobody knows exactly how or where surfing originated.\n\n\nThere must be a grain of truth in a persistent legend that the\naquatic activity was a popular pastime with Hawaiian royalty.\n\n\nBritish explorer Capt. James Cook, who sailed into the islands in\n1778, was the first European to note its popularity and observe that the\nsport seemed recreational than competitive.\n\n\nHe was followed by a band of spoilsports - - some Christian\nmissionaries - - who proceeded to suppress what they considered a frivolous\nactivity through much of the 19th century. \n\n \n\nSurfing in Hawaii was, however, officially revived in 1920, when\na famous Hawaiian swimmer/surfer/actor/politician, Duke Paoa Kahanamoku,\nformed the first surfing club in Waikiki although five years earlier, he had\nalready introduced the sport to Australia.\n\n\nBy the time of his death in 1968, the sport had achieved worldwide\npopularity and international surfing competitions were already being held.\n\n\nIn swimming, he won three Olympic gold medals for the United States\nand for several years was considered the greatest freestyle swimmer in the\nworld until Johnny Weissmuller broke his record in 1922.\n\n\nIntermittently from the mid-1920s, Kahanamoku was a motion-picture\nactor and from 1932 to 1961, he was sheriff of the city and county of\nHonolulu. \n\n \n\nEveryone is welcome to try surfing but first, you must learn how\nto swim and it is particularly important to be a very strong swimmer.\n\n\nSo take lessons, practice swimming and learn survival techniques.\n\n\n \n\nFor starters, you can try joining the fledgling Surfing\nAssociation of the Philippines, a non-stock, non-profit organization\ndedicated to propagate and professionalize wave surfing in the country.\n\n\nIt was recently formed by a group of surfing enthusiasts like Manny\nCasto, Tarny Perkins, Jacob Uichico and Michael Guzman.\n\n\nIf you have time on your hands for travelling, head for the beaches\nof La Union and ask around for the Japanese surfer who provides lessons and\ncoaching for correct surfing techniques.\n\n\nWe were told it only takes a day to get through the rudiments and by\nday 's end, you should be able to stand on a surfboard over the big waves or\nyour money back. \n\n \n\nFrom there, you 're on your own and can proceed to visit the\nother surfing sites in the country in Baler, Quezon; Daet, Camarines Sur;\nBaras, Catanduanes; Borongan, Samar; and Siargao, Surigao del Norte.\n\n\nStill, never surf alone and check if the beaches are patrolled. \n\n \n\nThe most important piece of the equipment for surfing is a\nsurfboard.\n\n\nDesigns vary according to your specific needs and the conditions of\nthe water.\n\n\nBeginners are advised to start with a wide stable board, as they will\nfind it easier to control.\n\n\nModern surfboards are made of a plastic foam core that is shaped by\nhand or machine and then covered with a shell of fiberglass and resin.\n\n\nThe high-performance surfboards used by top professional competitors\nare known as shortboards.\n\n\nOn the other end of the surfboard spectrum are the longboards that\nare about the same thickness as shortboards.\n\n\nThe bottom of a board has from one to five fins near the tail,\nalthough the three-fin, or thruster, design is standard.\n\n\nThese fins provide the board with directional stability and enhance\nperformance by providing additional power and forward drive.\n\n\nWhile either board can be used in professional or recreational\ncontests, the shortboard is better for speed and aerial maneuvers. \n\n \n\nA wetsuit is also necessary in most climates as the surfer spends\na lot of time in the wind and water.\n\n\nThere are a number of suits locally available in various designs,\nbrilliant colors, wild patterns and thicknesses of rubber. \n\n \n\nFor the surfboards and wet wear, there is a one-stop shop\ndedicated to the sport at the second level, Building B of the Megamall called\n\" Quiksilver \" .\n\n\nThis shop carries an extensive line of surfing gear down to\naccessories, except sunblock that is also essential unless you prefer a very\ncrisp tan. \n\n \n\nThere used to be a line called \" Maui \" but it\nis only sportwear that capitalized on the popularity of the surfing wave.\n\n\nThey 're suitable for cruising the beaches and taking into the water\nbut they 're likely to rip apart when the big waves come.\n\n\n\" Quiksilver \" based in Australia is sturdier and\nspecifically designed for the sport.\n\n\nIt is based in Australia. \n\n \n\nPrices start at &peso;12,000 for foam surfboards and &peso;17,000\nfor the fiberglass coated types.\n\n\nWetsuits prices range from &peso;5,000 to &peso;11,000; board shorts\nfrom &peso;850; tees from &peso;900; and booties designed for gripping onto a\nsurfboard from &peso;1,600 and up.\n\n\nCheck out the other interesting and functional accessories yourselves\nlike caps, bags, wallets, watches, sunshades and swimwear. \n\n \n\nThe best surfing conditions occur when there is an off-shore wind\nforming large and smooth ocean swells in deep water that peak up into steep\nsets of waves, or breakers, as they encounter a shelf-like reef or sandbar 90\nto 900 meters offshore.\n\n\nAnother type of wave that surfers look out for but more difficult to\nride, is the taller, plunging \" \" dumper, &rdquo; \"\nwhich occurs with the steep rise of its bottom to the beach.\n\n\nThe lee side of a point of land or a jetty often has the proper\ncontour for good rolling break waves.\n\n\nUnder ideal conditions, like in Mahaka, Hawaii, with four-mile waves,\nsurfers can enjoy half a mile of riding or more. \n\n \n\nWhen the big waves begin to break, the surfer first swims with\nhis board out beyond their crests to the point where the larger rollers peak\nup.\n\n\nAs the wave approaches, the surfer paddles toward shore to attain\nsufficient speed to coast down the face of the wave.\n\n\nOnce the surfer, using his board, has caught the wave, he can rise\nfirst to a kneeling and then to a standing position and ride the wave until\nit dies out next to the beach.\n\n\nLong-board riders hold their arms over their heads and shift their\nlimbs, and thus their body weight, to control their speed and direction.\n\n\nTo increase speed and distance, experts ride diagonally toward shore.\n\n\n \n\nSurfing is presently seeing a lot of action in the Philippines\nthrough the 1998 Action Surfing Cup Series.\n\n\nThe first leg called the \" Philippine Centennial Circuit\n\" was held earlier this year in Aurora, Quezon, with surfers from\nthe region dominating the event owing to the huge population of dedicated\nsurfers in the area. \n\n \n\nThe big winners were Rommel Postor - - champion ( 1997 1st\nrunner-up, Daet tournament 1st runner-up and La Union \" Quiksilver\n\" 1st runner-up); Edmund Mendoza - - 1st runner-up ( 1997 \"\nQuiksilver \" champion, Daet Tournament champion and 1st Aurora\nSurfing Cup champion); and Gil Alcantara - - 2nd runner-up ( 1997 Aurora\nSurfing Cup runner-up).\n\n\nThe second leg of the series will be held sometime August this year\nin Catanduanes. \n\n \n\nWorld championships, which started since the earlier 1960s, are\nthe real big scene venues for surfing competitions.\n\n\nA greater number of these surfing event have been held on both coast\nof North America and in Hawaii, South Africa and Australia.\n\n\nIn international competitions, groups of five-men competing surfers\nperform in the same area, each making perhaps 10 wave runs during a meet with\neach run scoring up to 20 points.\n\n\nA panel of judges awards points based on takeoff, turns, length of\nride, and difficulty of wave selected. \n\n \n\nThe selection of a wave and when to end the ride are at the\ndiscretion of the individual surfers.\n\n\nThirteen points are awarded for a win, 10 for second, eight for\nthird, seven for fourth, and one point less for the next succeeding places.\n\n\nAnother system of scoring allows one point for a win and upward for\nsucceeding places. \n\n \n\nWhat are you waiting for?\n\n\nForget about jet skiing, which aqua sport is being discouraged for\npolluting the environment and compromising the coral beds.\n\n\nGo out there and surf to be among the first!  \n\n\n\n\n  Have a million pesos?\n\n\nPut up a fitness center  \n\n\n By Joel S.

{"text": "HOW TO  \n\n\n  Start a candle business with &peso;500  \n\n\n By TINA ARCEO-DUMLAO \n\n \n\nGONE are the days when candles were used mainly for religious\ncelebrations and commemorating the dead.\n\n\nWith today 's generation rediscovering the relaxing and therapeutic\nproperties of candles, these most basic of light sources have become very\nmuch a part of the 21st century lifestyle. \n\n \n\nDemand continues to grow as candles are now used for decorating\nhouses, as souvenirs and giveaways during special occasions and also for\nadding to the ambiance in restaurants.\n\n\nThis demand has made scented and decorative candle making a good\nbusiness opportunity for those who have the creativity to further stretch the\nuses and designs of candles. \n\n \n\nScented and decorative candles are not only easy to make but the\ninitial capital is not big and can generate a handsome profit. \n\n \n\nTo start the business, the budding  entrepreneur\n would need wax, dye, scented oil, nylon candle wick and a wick\nsustainer.\n\n\nBased on the candle-making course of the  Negoskwela \nLivelihood and Technology Training Center, the tools and equipment include a\nstove, wax container, storage racks, cutter, thermometer, stirrer ( wood,\nbamboo,  etc.  ) and a weighing scale. \n\n \n\nThere are different kinds of wax but the most commonly used wax\nis paraffin, which is a soft wax.\n\n\nIt is usually combined with microcrystallin - - a hard wax that makes\ncandles shiny and stearic or crystal polyethylene, which is also a hard wax,\nso that the candles would not burn so fast. \n\n \n\nParaffin usually makes up 90 percent of the wax ingredients when\nmaking candles while microcrystallin and polyethylene contribute 5 percent\neach.\n\n\nSo for one kilo of wax, 900 grams of paraffin is required and 50\ngrams each of polyethylene and microcrystallin. \n\n \n\nMore hard wax can be used if you want the candles to bum slowly.\n\n\n \n\nFor the dye, candle makers have a choice between the ordinary or\ntechnical dyes or the luminous/neon dyes.\n\n\nOrdinary dyes can be added to the wax mixture even if it is still hot\nwhile the luminous dyes have to be added only after the wax has slightly\ncooled or if the mixture turns cloudy. \n\n \n\nScented oil or fragrance, on the other hand, is classified into\norganic/essential oil or synthetic oils.\n\n\nOrganic oil is recommended as only a small amount - - even a drop - -\nis enough to add fragrance to the candles while it would take at least twice\nas much volume of synthetic oil to produce the same effect. \n\n \n\n Negoskwela  recommends the budding \nentrepreneurs  to prepare the wax in a well-ventilated workshop,\npreferably outdoors, as wax is flammable. \n\n\n  Methods of forming candles  \n\n \n\n  Dipping.  \n\n\nIt involves immersing the candle wick in melted wax then withdrawing\nit, picking up wax as it emerges and then dipping it into water to harden the\nwax.\n\n\nThe process is repeated until the desired thickness is obtained. \n\n\n Procedure: \n\n\n1. Put a candle wick in a hanger type or carousel type to allow\nseveral candles to be made at one time.\n\n\n2. Weigh nine parts of paraffin and one part of\npolyethylene/microcrystallin and place in a vat.\n\n\nMelt wax over direct heat.\n\n\n3. Allow the mixture to cool to about 49 degrees Celsius before\ndipping the candle wick.\n\n\n4. Dip the candle wick in the melted wax and withdraw as smoothly as\npossible to prevent imperfections.\n\n\n5. When the desired candle size is attained, remove the lower portion\nto obtain candles with uniform diameter.\n\n\n6. Hang candles to dry.\n\n \n\nA kilo of the combined paraffin/polyethylene mixture costs\n&peso;45 and &peso;80, respectively.\n\n\nThis can produce over 100 candles using the dipping method.\n\n\nThe candles can be sold for &peso;3 to &peso;5 each depending on the\nsize.\n\n\nThis means a profit of over &peso;400 from an investment of about\n&peso;60. \n\n \n\n  Pouring.  \n\n\nOr putting candle mixtures into containers such as glass, ceramics\nand metal. \n\n\n Procedure: \n\n\n1. Put paraffin wax and polyethylene wax in a pot or kettle for easy\npouring and melt over high heat.\n\n\n2. When the wax is half-melted ( mixture is cloudy), bring down the\nheat to medium.\n\n\n( You can use more than 10 percent of the polyethylene wax if you\nwant your candle harder and you want it to burn longer.)\n\n\n3. When the wax has melted completely, dip wick in the mixture and\nset aside to let the wax harden.\n\n\n4. Add as much of the dye to the wax as you wish to achieve the color\nyou desire.\n\n\nStir with a wooden spoon.\n\n\n5. Add the scented oil.\n\n\nYou can use more than 5 ml if you want a stronger-smelling candle.\n\n\n6. Remove wax from heat, pour into container of your choice with the\nwick placed in the middle.\n\n \n\nThe candle mixture should be allowed to cool to about 90 degrees\nbefore it can be poured into the metal or glass container and even lower to\n70 degrees if placed in a ceramic container. \n\n \n\nAside from simple containers, candle can also be poured into\nplaster of paris or silicon rubber molds to produce more intricate designs\nsuch as angels, stars or fruits. \n\n \n\nThe initial investment for a basic mixture is about &peso;357.50.\n\n\nThis consists of five kilos of wax, some dye colorants, nylon wick,\nwick sustainer to keep the wick upright, and gas used in the stove.\n\n\nThis mixture can already produce hundreds of simple candles and\ndecorative candles depending on the size of the container and the molds. \n\n \n\nPrices of scented and decorative candles are based on weight\nsince scented and decorative candles can take on different sizes and shapes.\n\n\n \n\nFor ordinary or plain candles, the price is computed based on the\nweight of the candles.\n\n\nThe price goes up depending on the color and scent added. \n\n \n\nFor decorative candles, the factor is between 0.20 and 0.24\ndepending on the scent used. \n\n \n\n ( For more information please call  Negoskwela\n at 9245111/9242102/ 9242105.)   \n\n\n\n\n  Creating music costs money too  \n\n\n By ANTHONY O. ALCANTARA \n\n \n\n THE BULK  of the work in producing a song or a\npiece of music is done in a recording studio - - for a price, of course. \n\n \n\nShow business would not be much of a show without music.\n\n\nThis means recording studios are indispensable in the entertainment\nworld. \n\n \n\nVery few wonder at the nitty-gritty that goes into creating\nmusic.\n\n\nWe take a look at the behind-the-scenes activities that go into\nproducing a song before you hear it on your favorite radio station. \n\n \n\nJay Manalo, manager of Greenhills Sound Productions, however,\nsays recording studios are expensive.\n\n\nThey 're definitely not for small-time undertakings. \n\n \n\n \" A studio costs about &peso; 3-&peso; 4 million,\nconsidering that a 24-track recorder and a mixer each costs about a million\npesos already, &rdquo;  says Manalo.\n\n\n \" This is an estimate based on the five studios of\nGreenhills Sound. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nBecause of the comparative decrease of prices of recording\nequipment in the 1990s, according to Agnes Manalo, owner of AJI productions,\na rudimentary studio can now cost only &peso; 1 million. \n\n \n\nThis includes shipping of the imported equipment from the United\nStates. \n\n\n  Sophisticated equipment  \n\n \n\nThe high technology used in making recording equipment makes it\nexpensive.\n\n\nRecording studios nowadays are multi-tracked, meaning you can record\ndifferent instruments on each track and thereby enhance the sound produced by\neach instrument separately for the desired effect. \n\n \n\nThis process is called \" mixing \" . \n\n \n\n \" Four of our studios here at Greenhills has 24\ntracks each.\n\n\nOnly one has eight tracks.\n\n\nWith a 24-track studio, you can accommodate a whole orchestra--one\ntrack for each instrument, &rdquo;  says Ocampo. \n\n \n\nMixers allow recording engineers to amplify the sounds to produce\nthe desired effect of the clients or producers. \n\n \n\nGreenhills Sound has not gone into digital recording yet, but it\nplans to graduate from analog technology by early next year. \n\n \n\nManalo, who uses digital recording technology in her studio at\nher home, says the kind of equipment that one ought to buy depends on how one\nplans to use it. \n\n \n\nHaving the most advanced technology in your recording studio does\nnot necessarily equate with good music production. \n\n \n\n \" In the end, it all depends on how one uses the\nequipment, &rdquo;  says Manalo. \n\n \n\nOcampo has the same view.\n\n\nHe says:  \" You may have the equipment, all right, but\nif you don't know how to use it,   wala rin   .\n&rdquo;  \n\n\n  Recording engineers  \n\n \n\nFor Ocampo, recording engineers make and break recording studios.\n\n\n \n\n \" They are the life of the studio.\n\n\nSometimes, clients come back only because of the engineer, &rdquo;\n he says. \n\n \n\nAt Greenhills Sound, they require people to have experience\nbefore hiring them as record-engineers.\n\n\nA background in electronics is necessary since the engineers\nthemselves should be able to do the troubleshooting if there are minor\nglitches.\n\n\nThere is, however, a maintenance engineer who does the major repairs.\n\n\n \n\nAs for Manalo, hers is a sole proprietorship.\n\n\nShe 's the manager and engineer rolled into one. \n\n \n\nActually, she graduated from the college of music of the\nUniversity of the Philippines with a degree in piano.\n\n\nShe found her calling in music production and engineering when she\nwas in New York. \n\n \n\nShe was then taking private lessons from Rebecca Kane, who\nrecommended the famous Berklee College of Music in Boston where she is an\nalumna. \n\n \n\nShe has always been interested in how music is produced or\nengineered. \n\n \n\n \" I really like listening to the radio, and I\nwondered how beautiful music is produced.\n\n\nI 've heard many bands rehearse their music and it isn't really that\ngood.\n\n\nBut during performance, their music was transformed, &rdquo;\n Manalo says. \n\n \n\nThis was, of course, due to the equipment used. \n\n \n\nBut sophisticated equipment requires not only the technical\nknowledge, but also the aesthetic sensibilities of the engineer necessary for\nexemplary music, according to Manalo. \n\n \n\nOther friends also recommended Berklee to her.\n\n\nShe also learned that Louie Ocampo, Tony Tolentino and Robin Rivera,\nthe producer of \" Eraserheads \" , were alumni of this\nprestigious school. \n\n \n\n \" When I went to Boston to visit Berklee, I knew\nit was the school for me.\n\n\nSo I went on to spend four of the best years of my life there,\n&rdquo;  says Manalo. \n\n\n  Music celebrities  \n\n \n\nOwned by Ivory Records, Greenhills Sound has its share of\ncelebrity  habitues  spending hours of recording time\nthere. \n\n \n\n \" To name a few, &rdquo;  Ocampo said,\n \" Jaya, April Boys, Lindsay Custodio, Ariel Rivera, Donna Cruz,\nRosel Nava, Richard Reinoso and Trina Belamide. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nFor Manalo, she has worked with Joy Marfil, composer and\narranger of the music for the movie \" \" Mulanay, &rdquo;\n\" an award-winning film where Jaclyn Jose starred.\n\n\nShe has also done the sequencing and the effects for the \"\nSide A Live \" album, among others. \n\n \n\n \" In the \" Side A Live \" album,\nthe arrangement of the songs was not the actual arrangement in the concert.\n\n\nThe songs were rearranged and made to appear to be the actual\nsequence.\n\n\nOf course you have to make the clapping and cheering between songs\nspontaneous and continuous, &rdquo;  Manalo says. \n\n\n  Profitability  \n\n \n\nHalf of the profits of Greenhills Sound Productions come from\nIvory Records ' own productions.\n\n\nVicor Records, a sister company of \" Ivory \" , also\ndoes its recordings at Greenhills Sound. \n\n \n\n \" But we also have many clients not from Ivory or\nVicor who do their recordings here.\n\n\nSome record the minus one or background music for their company\ngatherings.\n\n\nOthers who have their own bands record their own songs.\n\n\nAnd especially now, those interested in joining Metropop go here to\nrecord their demos, &rdquo;  Ocampo says. \n\n \n\nThese other clients, according to him, usually use up one to two\nhours of recording time.\n\n\nHourly rates vary from &peso;500 to &peso;1,000, depending on the\nplace, the number of tracks to be used and whether the studio uses analog or\ndigital equipment. \n\n \n\nAsked if Manalo also makes profits from her small studio, she\nhas an emphatic \" \" No &rdquo; \" for an answer. \n\n \n\nShe says her studio is not actually a recording studio.\n\n\nA more accurate term for it, according to her, is project studio.\n\n\n \n\n \" My studio is not actually for purely commercial\npurposes like Greenhills Sound.\n\n\nA project studio is actually run by the owner where he or she\ncreates her own projects, &rdquo;  Manalo says. \n\n \n\nAdvertising is really where the money is, according to her.\n\n\nBut she doesn't want the money as much as bringing out a good\nproduct. \n\n \n\n \" Actually, I 'm just new in the business.\n\n\nMy studio is only a little bit more than a year old.\n\n\nI would like to establish my name first before thinking about money.\n\n\nEven though I 'm not making a lot of profits now, I 'm really not in\na hurry. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nManalo is currently working on two album projects which she\nhopes will be big successes. \n\n\n  Tips for success  \n\n \n\nRunning a studio, for Ocampo, requires good management.\n\n\nHe believes that management must be able to take care of its\nemployees, especially the recording engineers, who frequently get pirated by\nother companies. \n\n \n\n \" The music industry is only a small world.\n\n\nYou really have to find a way to elicit loyalty from your engineers\nso that they would stay, &rdquo;  says Ocampo. \n\n \n\n \" A lot of wit &rdquo;  is what Manalo\nsays is needed to succeed in her project studio business. \n\n \n\n \" Social skills are very important, too.\n\n\nIn this business you have to relate with a lot of people, &rdquo;\n Manalo adds.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "869154ed-7d11-4b2b-8f79-44ad31eb6501", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.321237+00:00"}
{"text": "Adding the color of new life to the art of dyeing \n\n\n\n By Cecile G. Garcia \n\n \n\n ONLY  Luis Agaid, it is said, knows the art of\nnatural dyeing in the entire province of Abra. \n\n \n\n Mang  Luis does not look like he possesses special\nknowledge.\n\n\nHe is 56, short, dark and angular, with most of his teeth gone, his\nhair unkempt, his feet shod in rubber thongs.\n\n\nHe is a true Itneg, but he considers himself a Tingguian and traces\nhis ancestry to that tribal group. \n\n \n\nThe Agaids,  Mang  Luis says, are a distinguished\nfamily.\n\n\nHis forefathers were weavers.\n\n\nThey also had knowledge of natural coloring agents, and this knowledge\nis their legacy to  Mang  Luis. \n\n \n\n Mang  Luis ' craft is fast becoming obsolete.\n\n\nIn Abra and in other parts of the country, synthetic dyes are readily\navailable, easy to use and widely accepted despite their prohibitive cost.\n\n\n \n\nThis is a cause of concern, cautions Zenaida de Guzman, chief of\nresearch and development division of the Philippine Textile Research\nInstitute ( PTRI).\n\n\nPTRI has been studying natural dyes since 1984, and De Guzman started\nthe national research and development program on these products. \n\n \n\nMeanwhile, because of her involvement in traditional handicraft,\nPatis Tesoro of the  Katutubong Filipino  Foundation Inc. (\nKFF), has long been acquainted with  Mang  Luis.\n\n\nTesoro would travel all the way to Abra now and then to buy\nhand-woven goods from him.\n\n\nProdded by her friend Tweetums Gonzales, who was once president of\nCoca-Cola Phil., Tesoro was drawn to the idea of revitalizing the natural dye\nindustry and rekindling interest in it. \n\n \n\nIn 1993, KFF launched the  Katutubong Kulay \nProject ( KKP) with Tesoro and Gonzales as chief coordinators.\n\n\nTesoro 's ties with PTRI ( an off-shoot of her trade) easily paved\nthe way for getting the institute to participate in the project.\n\n\nFinancing could have been a problem, but the Coca-Cola Foundation\nagreed to be the funding agency for KKP.\n\n\nWhen the office of the provincial governor of Abra and the Abra State\nInstitute of Science & Technology ( Asist) consented to take part, the\npicture became complete. \n\n \n\n \" Our concerted effort, &rdquo;  says De\nGuzman,  \" is geared towards revising and promoting the art of\nnatural dyeing.\n\n\nPTRI hopes to develop and standardize production technology and to\ntransfer this technology to interested parties, particularly for commercial\npurposes. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nLast month, De Guzman conducted the first seminar-workshop in\nBangued, Abra, on the improved method of natural dye extraction and its\napplication.\n\n\nKKP, she says, is looking forward to making Abra the natural dye\ncapital of the country. \n\n \n\nWhy Abra?\n\n\nBecause the province is remarkably rich in natural dye sources - -\nand because of  Mang  Luis ' heritage which is as old as the\nemerald mountains of Abra. \n\n \n\nIn  Barangay  Namarabar in the town of Pennarubia,\n Mang  Luis tends to a nursery of natural dye yielding plants.\n\n\nThe nursery is the only one of its kind in all of Abra.\n\n\n Mang  Luis receives financial assistance from KKP to\nkeep it going.\n\n\nDuring the wet season when the roads are impassable and shallow\nrivers are pools of dense mud, Namarabar is inaccessible except by a hanging\nbridge that, though it seems endless, is about a hundred meters long.\n\n\nThe hanging bridge is old and rickety, the wood and bamboo planks\nsplintered and decaying here and there.\n\n\nWhen the weather is rough, crossing this improvised contraption is\nabout as cozy as a ride on a two-seater glider. \n\n \n\nNamarabar is clearly  Mang  Luis ' domain.\n\n\nHere, he lives with his family.\n\n\nWhile his wife weaves, his four children embroider finished products,\nusing the  Kimayan  technique which is indigenous to Abra and\nto the entire Ilocos region.\n\n\n Kimayan  is unique because it is two-sided, or\nreversible.\n\n\nIn his backyard,  Mang  Luis experiments with the\nalchemy of colors, a tantalizing task he is reluctant to pass on or\nsurrender. \n\n \n\nDe Guzman says about 17 natural dye yielding plants can be found\nin Abra.\n\n\nOf these, 13 have been verified.\n\n\n \" Verification means there are literature confirming\nthat certain plants produce certain colors, &rdquo;  she explains.\n\n\n \" But the literature can be so old that the same colors\ncannot be reproduced. &rdquo; \n\n \n\nNatural dyes are not always the same hue or shade as their\norigin.\n\n\nBut there are some exceptions such as the everyday  \nachuete   which spawns red or yellow-orange and, of course,\nwild ginger or   dilaw   which, expectedly, spawns\nyellow. \n\n \n\nWe are told that Abra possesses an eclectic bounty of plants and\ntrees that could be sources of every color imaginable.\n\n\nMost have strange names such as   binunga   ,\n  sapang   ,   tayum   ,\n  tekla   ,   katuray   and\n  bunga   which we believe is betel nut.\n\n\nMore familiar ones are mahogany and the majestic  narra\n .\n\n\nLess exotic though no less high-grade sources are the lowly \n malunggay   , the prosaic tamarind,   kamachile\n  and guava.\n\n\n \" There is a natural color pigment within the plant\nitself, &rdquo;  De Guzman explains.\n\n\nThis pigment may be found in leaves, barks, roots, fruits, trunks or\nstems.\n\n\nNatural colors, she says, are virgin and pure and monochromatic,\nranging from the deepest to the lightest shade.\n\n\nIn contrast, synthetic colors are nearly always a combination. \n\n \n\nThe bane of  Mang  Luis, observes De Guzman, is\nthe improbability - - nay, impossibility - - of reproducing a specific\ndesired color.\n\n\nLittle else is more frustrating in the traditional method of dyeing\nwhich De Guzman refers to as \"   sawsaw-alis \n \" , tantamount to trial and error or hit or miss. \n\n \n\nIn lieu of scientific technology,  \" it 's \n tantsahan   , &rdquo;  De Guzman adds.\n\n\n \" There is no uniformity in color or shade.\n\n\nYou can't repeat the color because you can't recall the process.\n\n\nThe quality is not consistent and the color fades or runs.\n\n\nWe would like  Mang  Luis and others like him to learn\na better way of doing what they already know.\n\n\nWhat we have put together is actually a 'cooking recipe.'\" \n\n\n \n\nBut  Mang  Luis, seemingly as stubborn as the\nfamed horses of Abra, is resistant to change which is not surprising because\nany kind of change can be frightening.\n\n\nStill, he attended last month 's workshop, with 40 other participants\nwho were mostly weavers. \n\n \n\nBasically, there is nothing wrong with  Mang  Luis '\nsystem of dye extraction and application, which he claims has been handed\ndown from one generation to the next. \n\n \n\nJust as when he was still a small boy,  Mang  Luis\nbegins by gathering raw materials for natural dyes.\n\n\nBranches, barks and roots are cut or pounded, while pods, leaves and\nseeds are left as they are.\n\n\nThese are boiled for three hours.\n\n\nThis is followed by decanting - - collecting the dye extract and\ntransferring it into another container. \n\n \n\nDecanting, says De Guzman, is not wise because it leaves\nimpurities in the extract which could hinder its effectiveness. \n\n \n\n  Sukang Iloko   is customarily added to\nthe solution and the yarns are soaked in it for 15 days.\n\n\n Mang  Luis is not aware that soaking the yarns\nactually weakens them.\n\n\nAfter two weeks, the dyed yarns are squeezed, wrung and sundried,\nrinsed once, squeezed and wrung once again, and allowed to dry in the sun for\nthe last time.\n\n\nThe yarns are now ready for weaving. \n\n \n\nPTRI 's method may not be a complete departure from the\ntraditional, but it is definitely more precise.\n\n\nAmounts of the dye source, water and other ingredients are measured\nin correct proportions. \n\n \n\nFor more efficient dye extraction, PTRI recommends chopping the\nsources very finely or grinding them, except for the seeds and pods.\n\n\nThe prescribed period for boiling is three hours, after which the\nextract is filtered using   katsa   or cheesecloth so\nthat the liquid is clear and free from impurities.\n\n\nOne important step  Mang  Luis overlooks is the\npre-treatment of yarns, or cleaning the yarns in preparation for dyeing them.\n\n\n \n\nFor cotton yarns the process requires mixing proportionate\nmeasures of Teepol detergent, sodium silicate, sodium hydroxide, hydrogen\nperoxide and water.\n\n\nThe yarns are boiled in the mixture for 30 minutes, removed, washed\nwith warm water twice, rinsed thoroughly and air-dried. \n\n \n\nSilk yarns seem more demanding.\n\n\nInstead of Teepol, grated Perla soap is used to which soda ash,\nsodium hydrosulfite, acetic acid solution and water are added.\n\n\nThis time, the silk yarns are allowed to boil for two and a half\nhours.\n\n\nAfterwards, they 're washed in warm water six times and in cold water\ntwice.\n\n\nThey are then soaked in acetic acid solution for 15 minutes, rinsed\nvery well and also air-dried. \n\n \n\nMordanting is as necessary as pre-treatment.\n\n\nMordants are merely binding agents which make the yarns more\nreceptive to the dye.\n\n\nNot at all esoteric, this solution is nothing more than water and\ntreated copper sulfate, used very sparingly.\n\n\nThe pre-treated yarns are completely immersed in the mordant for 30\nminutes.\n\n\nThey 're then set aside to cool and squeezed after some time.\n\n\nLastly, they are air-dried without rinsing. \n\n \n\nThe dyeing process itself is brief.\n\n\nIt 's not chancy or skittish.\n\n\nThe yarns that have been pre-treated and mordanted are placed in a\npot or with the liquid dye extract and boiled for two hours, stirring at\nfrequent intervals.\n\n\nWhen they are cooked, the yarns are removed and squeezed.\n\n\nThey are washed very well before soaping and cleaning with Teepol\nsolution ( water and a little of the detergent).\n\n\nFinally, the dyed yarns are rinsed once more and left to dry. \n\n \n\n \" Because of mordanting, soaping and thorough\nrinsing, &rdquo;  says De Guzman,  \" the dyed material\nis color-fast and stronger.\n\n\nIt is also less prone to breakage because of pre-treatment.\n\n\nMost important, the colors can be reproduced. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nAnd the PTRI method saves time.\n\n\nWhat takes  Mang  Luis 15 days can be done in one\nsingle day. \n\n \n\nPTRI has gone several steps ahead.\n\n\nNatural dye can be powderized and they have done it.\n\n\n \" The technology is there, &rdquo;  says De\nGuzman.\n\n\n \" We have always wanted to do it but could not due to\nlack of funds.\n\n\nThe Coca-Cola Foundation through KKP is helping us with that.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nFor all the praises that can be sung to it, the technology seems\ntoo sophisticated and may be transferred only to those who have the\nappropriate background or knowledge.\n\n\nIn Abra, it will be transferred to Asist where a &peso;300,000 pilot\nplant will be built next year. \n\n \n\n \" We already have a machine that can convert any\ndye source into powder form, &rdquo;  De Guzman says.\n\n\nCalled a spray dryer, it could well be any weaver 's or manufacturer 's\ndream come true. \n\n \n\nThe advantages of advanced technology are glaringly obvious.\n\n\n Mang  Luis and others in far-flung rural areas could\ngo to Asist anytime and have their dye sources powderized for a minimum fee.\n\n\nDe Guzman says it 's a way of sustaining the traditional dyeing\nmethod without the hassle, the tediousness.\n\n\n \" We are simplifying it, &rdquo;

{"text": "Sequel to the Revolution  \n\n \n\nTODAY is the centennial of the outbreak of the Filipino-American\nWar.\n\n\nNearly forgotten in the history of the 1896 Philippine Revolution,\nthat war is the last of the watershed events being commemorated in the\nCentennial of the First Republic before the celebration officially ends in\nApril. \n\n \n\nFilipino historians, including Prof. Jose V. Abueva who wrote\nabout the  \" forgotten war &rdquo;  in the \"\nINQUIRER \" 's In Depth section last Sunday, have pointed out that\nthe Filipino-American War was the second phase of the Revolution.\n\n\nThat phase came after the United States invaded the Philippines at a\ntime when the revolutionary army had driven the Spanish forces to the edge of\ncollapse. \n\n \n\nThe American military intervention reinforced by the signing on\nDec. 19, 1898 of the Treaty of Paris, in which Spain ceded its colony to the\nUnited States, cheated the Filipinos of the fruits of their armed struggle to\nwin independence from Spain, and ignited the fuse that exploded into the\nFilipino-American War, which started with the battle of San Juan Bridge on\nFeb. 4, 1899. \n\n \n\nHistorical accounts seeking to justify the US intervention and\nannexation of the Philippines tend to blur the importance of the\nFilipino-American War as a sequel to the aborted Revolution and, worse, to\ndenigrate the war as an \" \" insurrection &rdquo; \" by\nFilipino bandits so as to maintain the legal fiction that the Americans\nannexed the Philippines by right of an international treaty. \n\n \n\nTwo historical facts stand out in the San Juan Bridge \"\nincident. &rdquo;\n\n\nThe first is that the American sentries on their side of the bridge\nfired the first shot.\n\n\nThe American sentries were itching to fire their guns.\n\n\nThey had received orders to fire at any Filipino sighted in \nSantol  district, the no man 's land between Filipino and American\nlines posted on opposite ends of the bridge.\n\n\nThe racist overtones of the American action were expressed by an\nAmerican soldier who after the first shot that felled Filipinos said, \n\" Line up fellows; the niggers are in here all through these yards.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThe incident which the Americans provoked was the spark that\nspeeded the ratification in the US Senate of the Treaty of Paris by a\nmajority of one vote.\n\n\nThe outbreak of the war was the catalyst in the conversion of the\nRevolution from the war for independence from Spain into a war to defend that\nfreedom from American intervention.\n\n\nIt was the most decisive critical element that galvanized most of the\nrevolutionary forces scattered in the archipelago behind the Malolos Republic 's\ndeclaration of the war of independence. \n\n \n\nBefore the American intervention, the Malolos government only had\nlukewarm support from Filipino revolutionaries in a number of provinces where\nregional separatist or autonomy tendencies were strong.\n\n\nThe war against the Americans impressed upon the Filipinos a strong\nsense of national solidarity behind a common cause.\n\n\nThe enemy was no longer Spain; it was the United States. \n\n \n\nA long, bloody war\n\n \n\nANY attempt to belittle that second phase of the Revolution\ncrumbles in the face of evidence that the war lasted from 1899 to 1906, the\ndate the last Filipino general, Macario Sakay was captured; that Filipino\nresistance was fierce; that by 1901, there were 120,000 American troops\ndeployed in the islands; and that there were widespread devastation, heavy\ncasualties and large-scale decimation of the population. \n\n \n\nThe resistance lasted for seven years--longer than the Revolution\nagainst Spain, from 1896 to 1899.\n\n\nIt was more fierce than the Filipino resistance to the Japanese\ninvasion and occupation--a fact that has been played down by the so-called\n\" \" benevolent assimilation &rdquo; \" aspect of the\nAmerican pacification campaign. \n\n \n\nThe Malolos Republic itself, inaugurated in January 1899, was\nshort-lived.\n\n\nFacing superior American forces, President Emilio Aguinaldo 's\ngovernment took flight from Malolos in March and transferred the capital to\nSan Isidro, Nueve Ecija.\n\n\nThen he retreated farther north to Palanan, Isabela, where he was\ncaptured on Sept. 6, 1900. \n\n \n\nBut Aguinaldo 's capture did not end the war.\n\n\nPockets of guerrilla resistance continued until one by one the\nrevolutionary generals surrendered or were arrested. \n\n \n\nIt is therefore fitting that the centennial of the\nFilipino-American War has been given fuller recognition as not just a\nfootnote of revolutionary history but as a defining event leading to the next\nphase of Filipino co-optation into the establishment of civil government in\nthe Philippines.  \n\n\n\n\n  Magic Potion  \n\n \n\nDESPERATION seems to be written all over it, but at least some\nlocal governments and plain folks are doing something to banish the scourge\nthat health officials still can't bring themselves to call an epidemic, much\nless tackle with the urgency it deserves.\n\n\nAs of the latest count, dengue fever has afflicted 13,024 people\nsince the beginning of the year, killing 236 of them.\n\n\nThose figures most certainly understates the problem, given that most\nFilipinos are not in the habit of rushing to doctors until it is almost too\nlate.\n\n\nBut other than compiling records, Department of Health officials seem\nto have done little more than wring their hands in frustration, leaving\nothers to deal with the problem. \n\n \n\nIn Quezon City, which has been identified as one of the \"\n\" dengue hot spots, &rdquo; \" a councilor has proposed the\nsuspension of classes for a week to allow government workers to fumigate\ncampuses and surrounding areas.\n\n\nThe objective is not bad at all: keep the schools safe for children\nwho are especially vulnerable to the disease by eradicating the\ndengue-carrying mosquitoes, which bite in the daytime.\n\n\nHealth authorities have pointed out, however, that killing the\nmosquitoes may not be the most effective way of stopping the spread of the\ndisease since it would spare the larvae that thrive in stagnant waters.\n\n\nBut at least it takes care of one-half of the problem. \n\n \n\nIn Pangasinan where at least 15 persons have been killed by\ndengue fever, civic leaders have organized  \" walking blood\nbanks &rdquo;  to provide safe and hopefully adequate sources of\nblood for patients needing transfusion.\n\n\nThere are no blood banks in the province, and buying blood from\nManila takes at least two days, a delay that could be fatal in some cases.\n\n\nThus, officials of the Lyceum-Northwestern Educational Institution\nthought of keeping a list of healthy individuals who are willing to donate\nblood when needed.\n\n\nThe idea couldn't be any better.\n\n\nFresh blood or fresh plasma is best for hemorrhagic fever, according\nto doctors.\n\n\nBesides there can hardly be any better place for storing blood than\nright in the bloodstream of the donors themselves.\n\n\nThe only problem is whether there will be enough  \"\nwalking blood banks &rdquo;  to supply the needs of patients\nafflicted with H-fever. \n\n \n\nMost interesting are the reportedly successful treatment of\ndengue patients with a brew made from boiling a herb that Cebuanos call\n\"  mangagaw  \" or \"  busikad \n\" .\n\n\nA health official in Cebu City said a number of parents have come\nforward to claim their children had been cured of dengue after drinking\nseveral glasses of the herbal brew.\n\n\nOne of them was a 4-year-old boy who was pale and weak and bleeding\nthrough his mouth and nose that doctors said he needed a blood transfusion.\n\n\nIn desperation, his parents took the advice of a friend who\nrecommended that they make him drink  mangagaw  .\n\n\nSix hours after the child downed a glass of the brew, he was feeling\nwell and asking for food. \n\n \n\nIs this the cure for H-fever that doctors have been seeking?\n\n\nThe parents swear the herbal medicine worked like a miracle on their\nsick children.\n\n\nBut city health officials are not about to endorse it yet, saying\nthere is yet no scientific evidence proving its potency.\n\n\nThey have sent samples of the herb to the University of the\nPhilippines in Los Ba&ntilde;os for analysis. \n\n \n\nExperts have said it would take at least five years to develop a\nvaccine against dengue.\n\n\nIf the native herbal cure proves effective, it would be a major\nbreakthrough in the campaign against dengue not only in the Philippines but\nin many other tropical countries all over the world. \n\n\n  Food of the future  \n\n \n\nTO MANY old folks ( and some who are not so old), papaya has two\ndistinct characteristics.\n\n\nFirst, it helps people who are encountering difficulties with their\ndaily ( toilet) ritual.\n\n\nSecond, it is what Hillary Clinton should have fed US President Bill\nClinton from the first time they met. \n\n \n\nThere may be a firm basis for the first, but the second seems to\nrest on shaky grounds. \n\n \n\nA Russian molecular biologist, Dr. Ludmila Korkina, said\nPhilippine papaya has a higher nutritional level than food supplements given\nto cosmonauts during simulated space flights.\n\n\nCosmonauts who ate papaya were found to be better able to maintain\ntheir physical, psychological and emotional well-being under stressful\nconditions, Korkina told the 46th International Congress on Aviation and\nSpace Medicine in Singapore last week.\n\n\nAside from showing improved ability to combat physical, mental and\nemotional fatigue, the same cosmonauts also showed better eye-hand\ncoordination and improved waking capacities than those who were fed a\ndifferent diet.\n\n\nThis makes papaya a  \" functional food &rdquo; \nand the food of the next millennium, she said. \n\n \n\nBut why are these properties found only in Philippine papaya?\n\n\nThat ought to be the subject of further research.  \n\n\n\n\n  Study  \n\n \n\nWE thought President Estrada hired a spokesperson precisely to\navoid problems of the sort.\n\n\nThat was the reason Malaca&ntilde;ang specifically cited for bringing\nin Fernando Barican.\n\n\nHe was there to make sure the President recovered from his\nfoot-in-mouth disease - - that is, from his penchant for making off-the-cuff\nremarks that put him in a bad light with the press.\n\n\nHenceforth, Barican was to issue the official statements and meet\nwith the reporters.\n\n\nThat was the idea. \n\n \n\nBut barely had Barican warmed his seat when the same problem came\nback to haunt Malaca&ntilde;ang, and with a vengeance.\n\n\nIn but two days, Mr. Estrada ended up being corrected no less than\nthree times by his own people. \n\n \n\nFirst, Mr. Estrada said that the talks with the  Moro\n Islamic Liberation Front had been suspended in the light of the\nkidnapping of Italian priest Luciano Beneditti.\n\n\n \" Unless we get the victim, &rdquo;  he told\nreporters at Camp Crame,  \" we don't resume negotiations.\n&rdquo; \n\n\nNot so, his security advisers said.\n\n\nThey were still hard at work negotiating with the MILF.\n\n\nThey denied ever recommending that talks be suspended on account of\nthe kidnappings in the South. \n\n \n\nNext, Mr. Estrada expressed optimism about the peace and order\nsituation in the South.\n\n\nThe number of kidnappings was nothing to be alarmed about, he said.\n\n\nIt merely indicated that the kin of the victims were now more willing\nto report their abduction and cooperate with the police.\n\n\nNot so, said Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora.\n\n\nThe kidnappings were a cause for alarm, indicating as they did that\ncriminal elements were testing the President 's resolve in fighting crime.\n\n\n \n\nAnd finally, dismayed by the charges of corruption the ombudsman\nand his second-in-command were hurling at each other, Mr. Estrada told\nreporters he would summon the two and try to settle the dispute between them.\n\n\nIt wasn't good for the country 's anti-corruption campaign, he said,\nthat the highest officials of the anti-graft body would accuse each other of\nthe one thing they were sworn to rid the country of.\n\n\nNot so, said Barican.\n\n\nThe President may not summon the officials of an independent body.\n\n\n \n\nMr. Estrada hastened to explain that his utterances might not\nalways be construed as policy.\n\n\nThat excuse is worse than the thing it is meant to justify.\n\n\nWe can understand that when the President talks about the weather, he\nis not talking policy, though in these days of El Ni&ntilde;o and La\nNi&ntilde;a, you can't even be sure about that.\n\n\nWe can understand that when the President talks about the relative\nvirtues of  karaokes  , he is not talking about policy.\n\n\nBut we cannot understand why when the President talks about\nnegotiations with the MILF, the state of peace and order in the South, and\nthe corruption charges made by Deputy Ombudsman Francisco Villa against\nOmbudsman Aniano Desierto, he cannot possibly be talking about policy. \n\n \n\nCoordination, or getting their act together, will help.\n\n\nBut even that has its limits.\n\n\nThe problem is not just that the President isn't coordinating with\nhis people.\n\n\nIt is that the President isn't studying his lessons.\n\n\nWhen you are the president, you  must  know you cannot\nmeddle in the affairs of a constitutionally mandated body.\n\n\nThe President has pleaded for understanding and tolerance from the\npress and the public as he is new in his job.\n\n\nThat the press and the public can easily give.\n\n\nBut they must plead as well that he show respect and devotion to\nthat office. \n\n \n\nTeachers may be able to abide intellectually challenged pupils\nwho show diligence and industry.\n\n\nBut they may never be able to do so for goof-offs who keep asking\nfor passing grades.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "7cd3d77d-3e09-4596-8f7e-90e9b5fba3c1", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.324029+00:00"}
{"text": "What, pray, are the facts?  \n\n \n\nHERE we go overboard again on the floods triggered by a leak in a\ntailings impoundment dam of Marcopper Mining on Marinduque Island. \n\n \n\nWhat is not at issue is that two rivers have overflowed their\nbanks because of the release of 1.5 million metric tons of muddy waters from\nthe impounded dam.\n\n\nIt has also been established that about 500 families have been\nisolated by the floodwaters. \n\n \n\nWhat is not clear is whether the outflow from the dam is toxic.\n\n\nMarcopper officials said it isn't.\n\n\nThey said it 's water mixed with finely ground particles.\n\n\nThey added the chemicals the copper mine uses are not toxic at the\napplied concentration. \n\n \n\n\" Experts &rdquo; sitting on their chairs in Manila,\nhowever, insist the waters are  \" toxic. &rdquo; \n\n\nThey point to the studies that heavy metals such as cobalt, mercury,\nand molybdenum - - by-products of copper mining - - pose a threat to health,\nin the long term.\n\n\nFor all we know, they could be right. \n\n \n\nThe glaring omission in the reports, however, is that no\ngovernment agency has come up nearly a week after the leak was first reported\nwith the finding on the toxicity of the dam waters.\n\n\nWhat gives?\n\n\nIt is simplicity enough to take samples from the main impoundment\ndam, then from spots, say, every kilometer downstream.\n\n\nThe science department and the universities surely have more than\nenough spectroscopic instruments to determine the presence of the heavy\nelements and their concentrations.\n\n\nThere are also the assay laboratories of other mining companies and\nof the independents, such as SGS. \n\n \n\nInstead of such hard data, officials offer anecdotal evidence of\na teenager and his uncle who felt very dizzy and nauseated after eating fish\nfrom one of the affected rivers. \n\n \n\nThis isn't science.\n\n\nThis is  kwentong kutsero  .\n\n\nThere are some 7  barangays  said to be on the paths\nof the Boac and Makulapnit rivers.\n\n\nAnd they are now telling us two cases of a bum stomach are proof of\nthe rivers being poisoned? \n\n \n\nWith the coming of the Aquarian age and the emergence of the cult\nof Gaia, the Earth Mother, it is distinctly reactionary to talk about the\nscientific culture.\n\n\nBut that 's what we are missing in reports about the Marcopper\n\" disaster. &rdquo; \n\n \n\nFrom the feudal superstition, we, or rather the politically\ncorrect, jumped right into \" New Age &rdquo; mysticism.\n\n\nWe seem to have thoroughly missed out the age of science. \n\n \n\nThe result is, not surprisingly, abysmal mass ignorance.\n\n\nIt could make a thinking man weep. \n\n\n\n\n  Enough of hypocrisy  \n\n \n\n LAKAS  - NUCD should stop their hypocritical\nposturing over Hilarion Ramiro.\n\n\n Lakas  isn't the Round Table.\n\n\nEverybody knows  Lakas  has never advertised leading a\nvirtuous life as a qualification for party membership. \n\n \n\nNo, we are not naming names.\n\n\nBut the  Lakas  national leadership can meet anytime\nand we are pretty confident not one of its members can presumptuously claim\nhe is the reincarnation of Sir Galahad, the pure of heart. \n\n \n\n Lakas  ' attempt to distance itself from the\nstench accompanying the uncovering of the corruption at the Department of\nHealth during the watch of Ramiro is understandable.\n\n\nRamiro is a  Lakas  \" orig, &rdquo;  one who not so humbly described himself as among \n\" the best and the brightest &rdquo;  in President Ramos '\nvehicle for his presidential bid in 1992. \n\n \n\nIf he is among the best and the brightest, what does that make of\nthe rest of the  Lakas  guys?\n\n\nThe worst and dullest? \n\n \n\nIf only for that left-handed compliment, the  Lakas\n rank and file have all the right to demand Ramiro 's expulsion.\n\n\nIt was Lakas, which pushed for the appointment of Ramiro.\n\n\nParty leaders should take their cue from President Ramos.\n\n\nThey should all apologize for this disaster they foisted on us. \n\n \n\nBut they should spare us the sermon on morals.\n\n\nSen. Leticia Ramos Shahani may keep flagging her dead horse of a\nmoral recovery program.\n\n\nBut polls will be polls.\n\n\nWith elections due two years from now, they will all be preparing\ntheir war chests.\n\n\nGuess where they will get the money? \n\n \n\n Lakas  is proud of having 95 percent of elected\nofficials under its fold.\n\n\nIt 's the ruling party; that should not be surprising.\n\n\nBut most of the current members did not join  Lakas \nbecause of the moral virtues of the \" origs &rdquo; like, ah, Ramiro.\n\n\nThey knew which side of the bread is buttered.\n\n\nAnd it isn't  Laban  , Nationalist People 's Coalition\nor the Liberal Party. \n\n \n\nIf  Lakas  kicks out Ramiro, then it must be\nprepared to expel most of its members.\n\n\nGraft and corruption stares us right in our faces.\n\n\nSince  Lakas  members control practically all national\nand local offices, the party cannot toss the blame on anybody else. \n\n \n\nThat 's the danger with putting on the cloak of moral\nuprightness.\n\n\nPeople might mistakenly believe the hypocrites.\n\n\nAnd seriously expect them to live up to their pronouncements of\nvirtue.  \n\n\n\n\n  Nice job  \n\n \n\nTHOSE who have given up on government should take heart.\n\n\nThe executive may be reeling under the corruption scandal that led to\nthe resignation of Hilarion Ramiro.\n\n\nCongress is holding inquiries right and left in aid of everything but\nlegislation. \n\n \n\nBut the consensus on economic reforms is that the central program\nof the Ramos administration is holding.\n\n\nAs long as Congress and the executive hold the course, we can forgive\nthem their antics. \n\n \n\nYesterday President Ramos signed into law four major economic\nbills.\n\n\nIn each, there were opportunities for mischief and some legislators\nallowed not the opportunity to pass without grandstanding.\n\n\nIn the end, good sense - - and party line - - prevailed. \n\n \n\nThe lifting of quantitative restrictions on agricultural imports\nand their replacement with tariffs ( RA 8178) writes  finis\n to the failed policy of self-sufficiency that had long prevented\nthe country from pursuing the export and market-oriented strategy that\nunderpins the phenomenal growth of our Asian neighbors. \n\n \n\nThe passage of the law could not have come any sooner.\n\n\nThe World Trade Organization gave the country a March 30 deadline to\ndismantle the dizzying structures of import prohibitions, licensing and\nquotas built over the years and covering such wide ranging products as corn\nand onions. \n\n \n\nDeregulation of the oil industry for a time seemed to have become\na political football between the Senate and the Congress, with the dispute\ncentering on the tariff differential between imports of crude and oil\nproducts.\n\n\nThis was a side issue.\n\n\nThe point was to depoliticize the oil industry.\n\n\nRepublic Act 8180 does it, even with that unwieldy automatic pricing\nscheme in the transition. \n\n \n\nRepublic Act 8179 makes easier the entry of foreign investors.\n\n\nBut the Foreign Investments Act is long in place.\n\n\nThis is just a sweetener, especially for Filipinos who have acquired\nanother citizenship to own land for housing and business.\n\n\nThe attempt to re-introduce the Negative List C, which enumerates\nbusinesses \" adequately served &rdquo; by Filipino nationals and thus,\nclosed to foreigners, thankfully did not pass. \n\n \n\nRepublic Act 8181 changes the basis of computing the value of\ntrade goods from home consumption value to transaction value, with a\ntransition stage through the so-called Brussels definition ( wholesale value\nin the country of origin).\n\n\nThe Philippines remains among the very few countries still sticking\nto the unwieldy home consumption value system which relies on some phantom\nprice set by bureaucrats.\n\n\nThe shift to transaction will make pricing of goods realistic and can\nonly benefit both producers and consumers.\n\n\nTo Congress, nice job.  \n\n\n\n\n  A House oversight on EVAT  \n\n \n\nTHERE 's logic on the side of house members in granting a\npresumptive input tax of 4 percent to government contractors in computing\ntheir 10 percent value added tax. \n\n \n\nThe 10 percent VAT is taken into account by the contractors when\npreparing their proposals.\n\n\nThey obviously just tack on the tax to their bids.\n\n\nThe government pays higher.\n\n\nIt gets back the added costs through VAT collections. \n\n \n\nBut why 4 percent in the House Bill passed seeking to amend the\nExpanded VAT law?\n\n\nAnd does this mean they no longer enjoy the VAT input credits on the\nraw materials and services that go into their projects?\n\n\nOur reading is that this presumptive input tax is in addition to VAT\ninput credits.\n\n\nThe result is that government contractors are practically VAT exempt.\n\n\nWell, as we have said, applying VAT on government contracts is taking\nmoney away from one government pocket and putting it in another.\n\n\nNothing to it, really. \n\n \n\nWhat is not easily understood is why the House set a lower 2\npercent presumptive input tax on agricultural processors.\n\n\nA 4 percent presumptive input tax would have been just fine as\nrecommended by economists from academe.\n\n\nIt would correct the penalty imposed on agricultural processors under\nthe VAT system. \n\n \n\nWhy agricultural processors are penalized started innocently\nenough from the best of intentions.\n\n\nUnder the original VAT and the EVAT, unprocessed agricultural,\nfishery, and livestock products are exempt.\n\n\nThis is to spare people from higher food prices that would result\nfrom VAT on unprocessed agriculture, fishery and livestock products. \n\n \n\nProcessors of these products, however, are slapped the full 10\npercent VAT.\n\n\nThey have to shoulder the full tax unlike other industries which can\ndeduct from their VAT liabilities the VAT paid on their raw materials. \n\n \n\nThere goes the avowed government program of developing\nagri-business with this crippling tax of 10 percent, not on the value added,\nbut on the gross sales of agri processors.\n\n\nA 2 percent credit would ease the tax rate to 8 percent.\n\n\nBut this is still higher than the tax burden, of, say hotels and\nrestaurants which under VAT benefitted from the elimination of the 5 percent\nsales tax. \n\n \n\nNow, who is the congressman in his right mind who would argue\nthat hotels and restaurants deserve a higher tax break than agri-processors\nwhich have direct backward linkages to farmers, fishermen, and livestock\nraisers? \n\n \n\nThe Senate contingent will do well to correct the anomaly when\nthe EVAT amendments go before a bicameral committee.  \n\n\n\n\n  Let the inefficient plant  camote \n \n\n \n\nWHAT do the following commodities have in common?\n\n\n* Onions, potatoes, garlic, and cabbages.\n\n\n* Roasted coffee beans, roasted ground coffee, instant soluble\ncoffee, and raw coffee of  robusta  ,  excelsa\n , and  liberica  .\n\n\n* Leaf tobacco not meant for blending purposes. \n\n\n* Rice, corn, and their substitutes, by-products or end products.\n\n\n\n* Cattle for breeding and slaughter and beef. \n\n\n* Corn and its substitutes, including wheat used for feeds, poultry\nand poultry products, pork and pork products, meat and meat products. \n\n\n* Seeds and planting materials. \n\n\n* Sugar? \n\n \n\nAnswer: Imports of these commodities are either prohibited or\nrestricted. \n\n \n\nWhen the supply of these commodities is scarce, the government\nmay allow their importation, usually by government itself ( rice and corn,\nfor example) or by users of these products through quotas and licenses. \n\n \n\nThe rice crisis of last year should have by now exposed the\nfolly of relying on the government to out-guess the market.\n\n\nThe rice imports came too little and too late.\n\n\nThe same situation is developing in the case of corn, with a\nprojected shortage of 800,000 tons. \n\n \n\nThe bureaucrats ' power to allocate economic resources is the\nroot of graft and corruption.\n\n\nThe yearly ritual of accusations of favoritism, for example,\naccompanies the auction of corn imported by the National Food Authority.\n\n\nThe sugar scam is still under

{"text": "The high cost of health care  \n\n \n\nIt is often said that health is wealth, but there is another\nreason for keeping healthy in this country: the high cost of health care.\n\n\nSurgery, cancer treatment, dialysis and other modes of treatment for\nlife-threatening illnesses are way beyond the reach of millions of Filipinos.\n\n\nEven more common drugs, however, are still too expensive for poor\nfamilies, which could partly account for continuing deaths from treatable\nailments such as dengue and even diarrhea. \n\n \n\nCan pharmaceutical products be made more affordable?\n\n\nLawmakers say that prices of several branded products in the\nPhilippines are much higher compared with those in other countries.\n\n\nThe lawmakers say that paracetamols and drugs used to fight infection,\nfor example, are more expensive here than in Bangladesh, Hong Kong, India,\nIndonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand.\n\n\nSome Filipinos who go on vacation in the United States bring home\nsupplies of vitamins and other pharmaceutical products because the goods are\nmuch cheaper there. \n\n \n\nIn an effort to bring down medicine prices, the government is\npushing for the sale of generic drugs.\n\n\nA lawmaker pointed out that you can buy a box containing 100 pieces\nof 500-milligram generic erythromycin for just &peso;217 while brand names of\nthe same product are sold at &peso;1,000 to &peso;3,000.\n\n\nBrand names of paracetamol, on the other hand, are retailed at prices\nfive to 10 times higher than their generic equivalent, it was pointed out.\n\n\n \n\nGeneric drugs, however, will take some getting used to for\nFilipinos who believe that different brands of the same generic medicine have\ndifferent efficacy.\n\n\nWhen a doctor specifies a brand name in a prescription, a patient\nbuys that brand and not its generic equivalent.\n\n\nThe government will have to make a more aggressive push for the\nGenerics Law in this country.\n\n\nApart from this, the government can review the pricing system for\npharmaceutical products to determine why they are cheaper in neighboring\ncountries.\n\n\nThere must be a way of bringing down medicine prices without driving\naway the drug manufacturers.\n\n\nHealth is wealth, and proper health care should not make a person\nimpoverished.  \n\n\n\n\n  Mayhem before Independence Day  \n\n \n\nCan independence be associated with hell?\n\n\nIt can, when the dry run for the Independence Day parade ties up\ntraffic throughout western Metro Manila.\n\n\nFor most of the day yesterday, vehicles crawled along all roads\nleading to the Rizal Park, where participants in the Independence Day parade\ntomorrow had decided to conduct their dry run without informing the public\nbeforehand.\n\n\nThree vital lanes were closed to traffic to make way for the tanks,\nfloats and participants from the different military, police and government\ncontingents.\n\n\nSome traffic officials said they had asked the Armed Forces to bring\nin their tanks on a Sunday, but the military opted for maximum mayhem and\npicked a busy schoolday, informing traffic cops only at the last minute. \n\n \n\nThe chaos yesterday can be forgiven if it was the first time it\nhad happened.\n\n\nPatriotism does entail a bit of sacrifice, and we 're supposed to be\ncelebrating the 99th year of our declaration of independence.\n\n\nBut this havoc each time the government prepares for the Independence\nDay parade has been torturing the public for the past several years now.\n\n\nAnd each time, the same things happen: the military refuses to inform\neven traffic cops that their cadets, soldiers, tanks and armored personnel\ncarriers are about to roll into Manila; D-day ( dry run day) is usually a\nweekday, probably to save on overtime pay; even traffic cops are taken by\nsurprise, so alternate routes are improvised, usually when the traffic is\nalready hopelessly tied up.\n\n\nBy the time the dry run ended yesterday, it was 5 p. m., the start of\nthe rush hour. \n\n \n\nThere is historical significance in staging the parade at the\nformer open field where national hero Jose Rizal was executed.\n\n\nThe inconvenience to motorists is minimal; June 12 is a national\nholiday, and the public is always well informed about the rerouting of\ntraffic for the celebrations at the Rizal Park.\n\n\nBut can't the dry run be staged in one of the military camps, which\nhave similar grandstands?\n\n\nAt Fort Bonifacio, those tanks and mounted artillery need not travel\ntoo far.\n\n\nIs it too complicated to simulate the parade 's path?\n\n\nMovements in the parade are no  pas de deux  ;\nparticipants must simply get from one point to the other, north to south.\n\n\n \n\nThis annual dry run is traffic mismanagement at its classic best.\n\n\nIt highlights the result of lack of coordination among government\noffices.\n\n\nIt also betrays a disregard for the public 's welfare.\n\n\nAnd some officials wonder why people no longer bother to watch the\nIndependence Day parade.  \n\n\n\n\n  A new chapter in RP-Singapore relations  \n\n \n\nWith a handshake to seal their countries ' renewed friendship,\nPresident Ramos bade farewell yesterday to Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok\nTong.\n\n\nSome groups tried to make an issue of the arrest of yet another\nFilipina in Singapore, but otherwise no major turbulence greeted Goh upon his\narrival this week for his long-delayed state visit here.\n\n\nSingapore 's prime minister must have already anticipated the\nrelatively trouble-free reception.\n\n\nLast November, no one bothered him when he attended the leaders '\nsummit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Manila and Subic.\n\n\nThis could have been due to the distraction provided by other\nAsia-Pacific leaders.\n\n\nBut it could also have been because Filipinos have put their\nbitterness behind them.\n\n\nAnd although the execution of Flor Contemplacion had not been\nforgotten, Filipinos were ready to move on. \n\n \n\nGoh, however, is taking no chances.\n\n\nAt the start of his three-day state visit, he announced that\nhenceforth, Philippine pathologists will be invited to conduct the initial\nautopsy on any Filipino who dies in Singapore.\n\n\nThe Philippine Embassy will also be immediately notified of any law\nenforcement case involving a Filipino.\n\n\nOther measures continue to be worked out to protect not just\nFilipinos but all the other migrant workers who constitute a substantial\nportion of Singapore 's labor force.\n\n\nThe ever practical Singaporeans know it serves no purpose for the\nSwitzerland of the East to be pictured as an oppressor of migrant workers.\n\n\nWith an accountant 's precision, they are moving to correct the\nglitches in this aspect of their national life. \n\n \n\nIt 's a long way from flag-burning to handshakes.\n\n\nThe tumult generated in the Philippines by Contemplacion 's execution\nin 1995 for the murder of fellow maid Delia Maga puzzled the dispassionate\nSingaporeans.\n\n\nEven when their flag was burned in the Philippines, however, there\nwas no violent reaction from Singapore.\n\n\nAnd there was no gloating when American forensic experts concluded in\ntheir autopsy on Maga that the Singaporeans were right all along.\n\n\nGoh 's state visit to this country, however, was postponed, and the\ntwo nations recalled their respective ambassadors. \n\n \n\nBoth countries have learned their lessons from the Contemplacion\ncase.\n\n\nNow Singapore 's leader has come and gone, profuse in his praise for\nthe Philippines and Filipinos.\n\n\n  \" I 'm here in a way to make up for the lost time.\n\n\n\nWe have a lot of catching up to do, &rdquo;  Goh declared.\n\n\nHis visit should mark a new and much better chapter in the relations\nbetween the Philippines and Singapore.  \n\n\n\n\n  A year before the Centennial  \n\n \n\nStudents of Philippine history initially get confused about the\ndate of Independence Day.\n\n\nWhen Emilio Aguinaldo declared the country 's independence from Spain\non June 12, 1898, the Spanish colonizers were negotiating with the Americans\nfor the price of these islands.\n\n\nA few months later, when the two powers finally settled on &dollar;20\nmillion, the Philippine capital was already occupied, not by Aguinaldo 's\nrevolutionaries, but by US troops.\n\n\nAnd the guns of US Admiral George Dewey 's naval armada were trained\nthreateningly on Manila.\n\n\nEven as Aguinaldo was defiantly proclaiming the nation 's\nindependence, some of his compatriots were already contemplating\ncollaboration with the new American colonizers. \n\n \n\nIt took nearly half a century and a ruinous world war before the\nAmericans finally left their only colony.\n\n\nAnd it took another 40 years before they finally shut down the\nmilitary facilities which had provided the Philippines with a security\numbrella for several decades.\n\n\nForeign intervention in Philippine affairs, however, did not end\nthere.\n\n\nAs the nation celebrated yesterday the 99th anniversary of the\ndeclaration of independence, the Philippines still hadn't \" graduated\n&rdquo; from a series of economic programs prescribed by the International\nMonetary Fund. \n\n \n\nThen there is the other type of independence awaited by the\npeople.\n\n\nBy the government 's own admission, a majority of Filipinos continue\nto live in poverty.\n\n\nThe ratio of rich to poor in this country may no longer be as skewed\nas in Aguinaldo 's time, but official statistics show that only a tiny\nfraction of the population continues to control the nation 's wealth.\n\n\nEconomic growth, again by the government 's own admission, has been\nslow in trickling down to the bottom rungs of society.\n\n\nThe Americans are gone, and the Philippines may soon exit from the\nIMF program, but emancipation from poverty for millions of Filipinos remains\na distant prospect. \n\n \n\nStill, there is reason to celebrate the spirit, which moved the\nnation 's forefathers to declare, against great odds, that they would rid\nthemselves of the colonizer 's yoke.\n\n\nAt the time, the declaration of independence might have struck some\nas wishful thinking or a best-efforts pledge, but the resolve to be free sent\nhome the message that Filipinos wanted to be captain of their own ship.\n\n\nA year shy of the Philippine Centennial, the present generation of\nFilipinos can only hope that liberation from economic want won't take another\n99 years.  \n\n\n\n\n  Go out and register - now!  \n\n \n\nFilipinos need not be told how government can affect their lives.\n\n\nIn a corrupt dictatorship, citizens must worry not only about\ncensorship, warrantless arrests and summary executions, but also about\nspiralling prices, \" crony capitalism &rdquo; and an unhealthy business\nclimate.\n\n\nAn incompetent leader can bring the nation to the brink of economic\nruin, inviting political instability and a breakdown in peace and order.\n\n\nGrandstanding lawmakers can derail vital pieces of legislation.\n\n\nAnd inept, corrupt local government executives can allow garbage to\npile up, traffic to be constantly snarled and flooding to get worse. \n\n \n\nThere has been much improvement in the years since Fidel Ramos\nassumed power.\n\n\nThe lights were restored, the coup attempts ended and peace loomed in\nMindanao.\n\n\nFortunes were made as the economy surged forward.\n\n\nNo longer was the Philippines referred to as the sick man of Asia.\n\n\nYet much also remains to be corrected, repaired, constructed.\n\n\nThere is traffic to be untangled, garbage to be collected and\nproperly disposed of, and potable water to be piped in to households.\n\n\nThere are roads and bridges to be built, more telephone lines to be\ninstalled.\n\n\nThere is a kidnapping problem to be addressed, an educational system\nthat has to be improved and a bureaucracy that has to be rid of corruption\nand red tape.\n\n\nThere are local industries which must be properly prepared for full\ntrade liberalization. \n\n \n\nHow can citizens influence the way the country is run?\n\n\nBy choosing the right leaders.\n\n\nAnd this can be done by participating in elections.\n\n\nThe electoral process, in turn, must be credible, and this can be\nensured through a voters ' list which has been purged of all \" ghost\n&rdquo; voters, flying voters - - all the names which aren't supposed to be\nthere.\n\n\nThis is the purpose of the four-day national registration which\nstarts today.\n\n\nFrom 7 a. m. to 5 p. m. today, tomorrow and next Saturday and\nSunday, all citizens at least 18 years old must register for a new voters '\nlist which will be used for the national elections in 1998. \n\n \n\nThe polls next year will determine who will manage the local\ngovernments, who will represent the different districts in Congress, and who\nwill occupy 12 of the 24 seats in the Senate.\n\n\nEven more crucial, the elections will determine who will lead the\nnation in its centennial and into the next millennium.\n\n\nThe right successor to Fidel Ramos can continue the nation 's\neconomic recovery and turn the Philippines into a full-grown tiger.\n\n\nBut the wrong president can easily unmake all the progress\npainstakingly achieved by the nation in the previous years. \n\n \n\nThe fate of the nation is in the people 's hands.\n\n\nIf you want to have a say in your life, go out and register today.\n \n\n\n\n\n  Sex tour operators on Internet  \n\n \n\nEven the developed countries have found it virtually impossible\nto control materials in cyberspace.\n\n\nThe Internet, which is turning the world into a true global village,\nis the nightmare of authoritarian regimes.\n\n\nWith this potent information tool, the truth can truly help set a\nshackled nation free.\n\n\nLike any powerful tool, however, cyberspace can be abused and\nmisused.\n\n\nRacists spread their gospel of hate via cyberspace.\n\n\nOn the Net, the technologically savvy can access information on\npainless suicide, the manufacture of bombs and incendiaries, and vital\ninformation on prominent personalities.\n\n\nNumerous Web sites are devoted to the ideas of the\nreality-challenged.\n\n\nAnd lowlifes can create their own sites to peddle sex in exotic\nplaces like the Philippines. ...", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "50440c52-d118-441d-bc25-243066a260d4", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.326920+00:00"}
{"text": "An action agenda  \n\n \n\nAN ACTION AGENDA to speed up economic recovery from the current\nfinancial crisis plaguing Southeast Asian countries, emerged at a meeting the\nother day of the Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council in\nMalaca&ntilde;ang. \n\n \n\nPresided over by no less than President Ramos himself, the Council\nheard Socio-Economic Planning Secretary Cielito Habito unveil some reform\nmeasures on the assumption that the economic difficulties may well get worse\nbefore they get better. \n\n \n\nIn this briefing, Habito, who is also director-general of the\nNational Economic and Development Authority, told the gathering that the\nAction Agenda aims primarily to reduce current account deficits, maintain\nfinancial stability and the growth momentum, keep prices stable, sustain the\nmomentum of reforms and support the disadvantaged. \n\n \n\nHe explained that some of these measures are already being\nimplemented. \n\n \n\nUnder the Action Agenda, the following will be pursued by the\nRamos administration:\n\n\n1) Fiscal discipline, which means the government is committed to a\n&peso;7.6 billion surplus by the end of 1997; 2) strengthen fiscal and\nmonetary coordination to ensure consistent approaches to interest rate\ndetermination through open market operations; 3) tighter monitoring of\ngovernment-owned and controlled firms by determining and assessing their\nfinancial condition; 4) rationalization of fiscal incentive package for\nprivate investors; 5) intensification of savings campaign backed by all\nlevels of government and the private sector; 6) a stronger banking system by\namending the General Banking Act; and, 7) a healthier corporate sector\nthrough monitoring of the financial conditions of the corporate sector,\nparticularly non-bank financial institutions. \n\n \n\nAll these may require a review of existing investment programs\nwith a view of giving priority to socially efficient projects over those with\nso-called low absorptive capacity or with cost overruns.\n\n\nIt may also involve tightening of the government 's revenue program by\nplugging loopholes and import leakages. \n\n \n\nInvestments on government-owned and controlled corporations\nencountering deficits may also have to be deferred. \n\n \n\nThe current crisis does not have to end in disaster and it is\nincumbent upon government to keep its macro-economic fundamentals strong and\nsound.\n\n\nIn short, the Action Agenda are but preparations for necessary\nbelt-tightening and economic and political reforms. \n\n \n\nIf properly pursued with greater openness and sincerity, there is\nno reason why the country cannot benefit from the lessons of this current\neconomic crisis.  \n\n\n\n\n  Wage adjustments  \n\n \n\nWHILE THERE SEEMS to be no dispute on the need for a wage hike,\nthe question is whether the matter of determining the level of increase\nshould be left to various regional wage boards or to Congress. \n\n \n\nBoth these two bodies have a direct line with the mass of working\npeople in the country, but the wage boards have a better grasp of the problem\nbecause they continue to deal with it on the basis of daily contact with\nworkers in their respective areas. \n\n \n\nEven members of Congress themselves agree that the wage boards in\nthe different regions are in a better position to decide the rate of wage\nincreases, but they added that they must decide the matter as soon as\npossible.\n\n\nOtherwise, they argued, Congress stands ready to legislate wage\nincreases should there be a failure on the part of the regional wage board to\nact. \n\n \n\nIn a tripartite consultation presided by President Ramos in\nMalaca&ntilde;ang, an agreement was reached on giving the regional wage\nboards the initial task of assessing the wage situation and make the\nnecessary adjustments. \n\n \n\nA pay hike is usually based on the needs of the workers, the\nprevailing wage levels, employers ' capacity to pay, productivity and its\neffect on job generation. \n\n \n\nAgitation for a new round of wage increases came in the wake of\nrising prices brought about by the devaluation of the peso and the ensuing\neconomic difficulties. \n\n \n\nThe President, who recognized the need for new wage adjustments,\ndirected Labor Secretary Leonardo Quisumbing in his capacity as chairman of\nthe National Wage and Productivity Commission, to ensure that the following\nobjectives are accomplished:\n\n\n1) A complete review of the existing wages granted by the regional\nwage boards and an expeditious action on all pending petitions for minimum\nwage adjustments; and,\n\n\n2) Based on established criteria and parameters, the determination of\nappropriate wage adjustments and when these should be given, consistent with\ndevelopmental goals and people 's need. \n\n \n\nWhile the purchasing power of the workers must be increased to\nenable them to cope with the rising cost of living, it is incumbent on the\nwage boards to assess the situation thoroughly so as not to stifle\nproductivity and government development goals. \n\n \n\nThey must also consider the proposal of some companies to defer\nwage increases at least till the end of the year, claiming that they cannot,\nat this time, afford such wage adjustments because business is on the\ndowntrend. \n\n \n\nWeighing carefully the pros and cons of the wage situation is no\neasy task.\n\n\nBut it must be done.\n\n\nAnd the regional wage boards must be allowed to do their work without\ninterruption from impatient and emotional NGOs, employees and other sectors.\n\n\n \n\nAfter these boards shall have finished their work and decided on\nthe rates, all sectors must accept their decisions as the final ones.\n\n\nEveryone must respect these decisions for the sake of industrial\npeace and productivity.\n\n\nEveryone must remember and realize that costs of living ( expenses)\nvary from one province or city to another. \n\n \n\nResidents of one urban center, or area, spend more ( or less)\nthan the other.\n\n\nThus, industrial workers must realize there can be no uniform minimum\nwages.\n\n\nThey must not be influenced by emotional and unenlightened political\noutbursts by demagogues.  \n\n\n\n\n  U.N. concern for RP 's plight  \n\n \n\nAS ONE OF THE FEW democracies in the Asian continent, the\nPhilippines seems to stand out as a major United Nations concern as it\nannounced renewed efforts to revive its ailing economy from tremendous\nchallenges. \n\n \n\nThis was seen in the decision of various U.N. agencies in the\ncountry to expand greater assistance to the Philippine economy to enable it\nto achieve equitable human development and sustain economic growth. \n\n \n\nAmong these fresh forms of assistance are: 1) assisting workers\ncope with rapidly changing labor market as a result of globalization, 2)\nmaintaining peace and enlarging economic opportunities in Mindanao, and 3)\nassuring food security in the face of the  El Ni&ntilde;o \nphenomenon. \n\n \n\nSpeaking at simple ceremonies here marking the celebration of the\nU.N. 's 52nd anniversary, U.N. System resident coordinator in the Philippines\nSarah L. Timpson said the times call for greater collaboration between the\nU.N. and local societies. \n\n \n\nShe cited new challenges, including new conflicts and new trends\nin development which, she said, require a mix of global and local approaches\nand strategies. \n\n \n\n \" The United Nations lives in the heart and mind of\nevery citizen striving to end violence and promote tolerance, advance\ndevelopment and ensure equality, protect human rights and alleviate poverty,\n&rdquo;  she added. \n\n \n\nSpecifically, she disclosed that U.N. fresh priorities in the\nPhilippines include: 1) containing a population growth rate which erodes the\ngains of growth, 2) strengthening the capabilities of small and medium scale\nenterprises to compete in the international market, 3) securing the welfare\nof children and women in families affected by migration and pressure of work,\n4) stopping the plague of drug abuse and rising crime, 5) cleaning the air,\nearth and water of dangerous levels of population and, 6) regenerating\ndamaged coral reefs, forests, soil, and marine resources. \n\n \n\nMs. Timpson voiced the hope that local societies will assist the\nU.N. in developing capabilities of people and mobilizing resources to meet\nnew threats and seize new opportunities toward the next millennium. \n\n \n\nThe U.N. is the latest world institution to recognize the\neconomic plight of the Philippines and to pledge support to the country 's\neconomic dilemma. \n\n \n\nWith its free and democratic tradition, the U.N. cannot very well\nallow another democracy to go under in the face of economic difficulties,\nsome of which are not of its own making.  \n\n\n\n\n  AIDS epidemic in Asia  \n\n \n\nIN EXPRESSING ALARM over the rising tide of AIDS ( Acquired\nImmune Deficiency Syndrome) cases in Asia, President Ramos called for not\njust  \" expression of solidarity on paper\"  but \n\" united action &rdquo;  to prevent this scourge. \n\n \n\n \" Clearly, the only recourse that nations can take\nis to share experiences, learn from each other, and be united in an\nunwavering commitment to combat AIDS, &rdquo;  he said in a keynote\naddress before the International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific at\nthe Philippine International Convention Center. \n\n \n\nAsia-Pacific countries, the President stressed, can no longer\nleave the task of looking for AIDS solutions to the West, particularly the\nUnited States where, he pointed out, more resources are being devoted to AIDS\nresearch. \n\n \n\n \" We in the Asia-Pacific could argue that the\nconditions here could not produce sophisticated approaches since we could\nhardly afford costly procedures and medicines prescribed to help people with\nAIDS, &rdquo;  the President emphasized.\n\n\n  \" But we can match the resources and expertise of\nthe West by contributing to its prevention, maybe even the cure for AIDS.\n&rdquo;   \n\n \n\nIf we have the will to do our share, we can certainly contribute\nto AIDS prevention and hopefully, its cure, he added. \n\n \n\nThe President was right in raising the alarm because of\npersistent reports that Asia, in a few years, will overtake Africa as the\narea worst hit by the AIDS virus. \n\n \n\nThis was seen in the warning by a UN official who said that,\nunless Asia wakes up and tackles squarely the AIDS threat, the region could\nsuffer a  \" tragedy of historic proportions for Asia 's\nbillions. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThis should come as no surprise because of the huge population of\nAsian countries like China, India and Indonesia. \n\n \n\nThe UN estimated that seven million Asians, including between\nthree and five million people in India, may now be HIV carriers and the\nnumber is expected to double by the year 2000. \n\n \n\nChurch groups like the Roman Catholic Church, which opposes the\nuse of condoms, should realize that they, too, have a stake in the fight.\n\n\nWhen it is a matter of survival or death, it is difficult to imagine\nthat any religion would like to lose its followers because of this epidemic.\n\n\n \n\nWhile we cannot expect church leaders to promote condoms, they\nare expected not to put up obstacles. \n\n \n\nAn unchecked AIDS epidemic in Asia is likely to have a big impact\non the region 's economies in terms of huge medical costs, productivity\nlosses and loss of markets.\n\n\nUN studies show that by the year 2005, Indonesia will be spending\nmore than one-third of its health budget on AIDS treatment. \n\n \n\nAccording to the same UN study, Cambodia, one of the countries\nhardest hit by HIV with an estimated 17,000 cases this year, would also pay\nheavily. \n\n \n\nClearly, implementing necessary preventive measures is \n\" pretty soft investment that has to be made not as a matter of high\ntechnology but one of partnership, education and making preventive measures\navailable, &rdquo;  the President said. \n\n \n\nThis appears to be the bottom line in the current fight against\nthe growing AIDS menace and this should be a basis for united action.\n\n\nPrevention is the key to the current fight against AIDS and Asian\nnations must never lose sight of it.  \n\n\n\n\n  Not a go-signal for squatting  \n\n \n\nA LAW, SIGNED the other day by President Ramos removing the\ncriminal liabilities of squatters, should not be mistaken as a go-signal for\nsquatting. \n\n \n\nApprehension over this is allayed by several provisions of the\nlaw ( R.A. 8368), which still prescribes sanctions against so-called\nprofessional squatters and squatting syndicates under the Urban and\nDevelopment Act ( R.A. 7279) and the Revised Penal Code. \n\n \n\nThe new law merely dismisses all court cases filed under\nPresidential Decree 772 and sets free all those serving sentence for\nviolation of this martial law decree, which penalizes squatting and other\nsimilar acts as a crime. \n\n \n\nThe new law also ends the indiscriminate demolition of squatters '\nhouses but by no means opens the floodgates to squatters. \n\n \n\nThe President said:  \" The law must not be construed\nas a go-signal for any squatter to pitch a tent or build a shanty on any\nvacant piece of land, be it private or public in nature. &rdquo; \n\n\n \n\nIn short, what the law means in decriminalizing squatting is\nthat, while it will uphold the social and human rights of the urban poor, it\nwill not diminish the legal protection afforded property owners. \n\n \n\nAdequate protection is provided in the Revised Penal Code,\nparticularly Articles 281 and 312, which penalize any person who enters the\nuninhabited premises of another or who, by means of violence, usurps any real\nrights in property belonging to another. \n\n \n\nIt is clear that the law is principally intended to penalize\nwell-to-do \" squatters &rdquo;

{"text": "Keep Cambodia out of ASEAN  \n\n \n\nTHE ASSOCIATION of Southeast Asia ( ASEAN) foreign ministers did\nthe right thing in postponing indefinitely the entry of Cambodia into the\nregional grouping. \n\n \n\nPutting on hold Cambodia 's entry to the ASEAN should put\nadditional pressure on the Hun Sen government to respect the 1991 UN-brokered\npeace accord that provided for a coalition government.\n\n\nThe recent Hun Sen-led  coup d'etat  that sent\nFirst Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh to exile in France is clearly a\ncase of a violent change in government that deserves condemnation by ASEAN.\n\n\n \n\n \" For those of us who signed the accords in Paris,\nwe would not be very happy seeing the results of the ( 1993 UN sponsored)\nelections set aside, especially by use of force, &rdquo;  says\nForeign Secretary Domingo Siazon, Jr. \n\n \n\nThat sentiment is apparently shared by the other ASEAN ministers,\neven as Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi earlier remark that\nASEAN will adhere to the principle of non-interference in a neighbor 's\ninternal affairs had raised fears that Cambodia 's membership would push\nthrough despite the violent take-over by Hun Sen forces. \n\n \n\nThat the ASEAN decision to deny Cambodia 's membership for the\ntime being is a correct step is validated by the position taken by the UN\nspecial representative to Cambodia, Ambassador Thomas Hammerberg, who said in\nstatement that he  \" strongly condemns the violent \ncoup d'etat  which has displaced the lawfully elected government.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThe violent  coup d'etat  that toppled\nRanariddh from power has been justified by Hun Sen as necessary in the light\nof what he claims were attempts by his co-premier to align with the Khmer\nRouge.\n\n\nHun Sen himself, it may be recalled, was installed in power back in\n1979 with no small help from the Vietnamese.\n\n\nExpecting him to behave in democratic fashion by respecting peace\nagreements and elections is therefore like asking a leopard to change its\nspots. \n\n \n\nUnless the Hun Sen regime can show adequate proof that it is\nwilling to adhere to democratic processes and is giving up its obsession to\nkeep political power through the barrel of a gun, the ASEAN should keep\nCambodia out.\n\n\nSome lessons in democracy are perhaps best taught outside the\nclassroom.\n\n\nIn this particular case, Hun Sen will have to stay in the dunce 's\ncorner for the time being.  \n\n\n\n\n  Elementary justice  \n\n \n\nCONTROVERSY has dogged the Unification Church led by the Rev. Sun\nMyung Moon ever since we can remember, because of their unconventional ways\nof recruiting members, solemnizing marriage vows, and professing their faith.\n\n\n \n\nIn the Philippines, they are not only finding themselves under\nthe harsh glare of negative publicity, they are practically fighting for\ntheir right to exist. \n\n \n\nThe local members of the sect have raised a number of issues that\nshould at the very least be looked into by the proper authorities. \n\n \n\nOne, religious persecution.\n\n\nThe Church held a blessing ceremony at the PICC on January 23, 1996\nat which some 983 Filipina church members were betrothed to foreigners.\n\n\nThey ask: by what right can government interfere with their personal\ndecision to marry in this way, if their form of worship calls for it?\n\n\nWhat harm is done to others and to the country when they choose to\nworship in this way? \n\n \n\nTwo, manufactured charges.\n\n\nGovernment prosecutors have filed a number of charges against the\nsect:\n\n\n*One charge of illegal recruitment under R.A. 8042 ( the Migrant\nWorkers ' Act) and two charges of violations of R.A. 6955 ( the Mail Order\nBride Law), all filed with the RTC in Quezon City;\n\n\n*One charge of violation of Art. 177 of the Revised Penal Code (\nUsurpation of Public Functions) filed with the RTC in Pasay City. \n\n \n\nThe sect denies the illegal recruitment charge, saying the entire\ncase rests on the testimony of one former church member who joined the church\nunder false pretenses by declaring she was single and asking to be matched to\na foreigner, when in fact she was already married and had four children.\n\n\nBased on her testimony, ten sect members face detention without bail.\n\n\n \n\nThe sect likewise denies any violation of the Mail Order Bride\nLaw, which specifies the collection of a fee as a basis for violation.\n\n\nThe NBI found that the Church received &peso;1,500 from some of the\nbrides, but the money, says the Church, was used to pay for passport and visa\nfees. \n\n \n\nThree, human rights violations.\n\n\nUnificationists claim that they have been harassed by a congressional\ninquiry for over a year now.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Filipina brides have been denied immigration clearance\nto travel wherever they please, and even face detention without bail. \n\n \n\nFour, harassment and lack of fair play.\n\n\nThe DOJ is said to have filed cases against the sect in different\ncourts.\n\n\nThis, in their view, is pure and simple harassment that is likely to\ndrive them to penury. \n\n \n\nAnd five, they are crying extortion.\n\n\nIt seems that after the media and Rep. Ranjit Shahani were charging\nthat the Washington Times Foundation had tried to bribe Filipino legislators\nlast March, an emissary of the legislators was telling Church leaders in\nWashington D.C. that for the sum of &peso;10 million, no charges would be\nfiled against the Church members.\n\n\nLater, an emissary told the group that for the sum of\n&dollar;500,000, the charges would not be filed.\n\n\nThe Church turned down both requests. \n\n \n\nThe last charge is a serious one that we think deserves to be\nlooked into by the Department of Justice.\n\n\nIs the Unification Church being harassed and persecuted in this\ncountry because they turned down a plain and simple extortion demand?\n\n\nThe ball is in the hands of Justice Secretary Teofisto Guingona Jr.\nwho fought all kinds of persecution during the Marcos regime.  \n\n\n\n\n  Unclean water  \n\n \n\nIF WE 're to believe Sen. Orlando Mercado, we should now put the\nBoracay brouhaha behind us, and begin to address the bigger disaster case:\nthe contamination of Metro Manila water. \n\n \n\nMetro Manila residents may have felt far removed from the\ncontroversy when Boracay was declared by the Department of Environment and\nNatural Resources a disaster area after finding high levels of coliform\ncontamination in its beaches.\n\n\nBut the plague of dirty water may have been with us even before the\nBoracay case took place, Sen. Mercado now says, citing  \"\nindependent and focused testing &rdquo;  by the Senate committee on\nenvironment which he heads showing a  \" disturbing pattern that\nwaters both from underground aquifers and MWSS distribution pipes are heavily\nlaced with fecal coliform. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThe Mercado revelation does not really surprise us.\n\n\nWe 've long suspected that Metro Manila has always been contaminated,\nespecially during the rainy season, with just the strong hint of chlorine in\nour tap water to remind us that the MWSS is using generous amounts of\nchemicals to keep our guts from turning upside down from coliform and\nwhatever else is found in our sewers. \n\n \n\nThe senator himself recently went to two public markets and a\npublic school in Quezon City to conduct water potability tests.\n\n\nHis findings: water from deep wells, aboveground reservoirs and\ndistribution pipes linked to MWSS water mains having  \" moderate\nto heavy contamination of human waste. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThese results, if taken in conjunction with earlier findings from\nsimilar tests in the Tatalon area, reveal, according to Mercado, the need for\n \" a much wider campaign in other densely populated areas,\npublic markets, schools and even government facilities frequented by our\npeople. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nWe concur with this recommendation.\n\n\nThe Department of Health should start a thorough and comprehensive\ntesting of the quality of drinking water before a major outbreak of\ngastro-intestinal disease takes place in the city.\n\n\nEspecially now that the rainy season is here, untreated water could\nmean a major epidemic just waiting to happen. \n\n \n\nIf there is one lesson that the Boracay episode holds for us city\nresidents, it is this: we reap the whirlwind of our own folly.\n\n\nWe have contaminated our own water supply by throwing our waste\neverywhere, and then we complain that government is lax in enforcing\nenvironmental safeguards.\n\n\nPerhaps the question should be posed: who will save us from\nourselves?  \n\n\n\n\n  Anti-drugs drive  \n\n \n\nMANILA Mayor Alfredo Lim 's unorthodox campaign against drug\ntrafficking may have raised the hackles of human rights groups, but who 's to\nsay that it is all for naught? \n\n \n\nMarking the homes of suspected drug dealers - - some 200 of them,\nas of last count - - will definitely not stop the drug problem dead in its\ntracks.\n\n\nBut we 're inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt given the\nextent of the social menace. \n\n \n\nAnd until such time that the proper court of law deems Mayor Lim 's\nunconventional approach unconstitutional and a violation of law, we are\nreserving further judgment on the issue. \n\n \n\nWe share the apprehensions of those who feel that Mayor Lim 's\nanti-drugs drive could be open to abuse, and could lead to mob rule.\n\n\nSenior Superintendent Avelino Razon Jr., the lead implementor of\nMayor Lim 's strategy of humiliating the pushers in their own neighborhood,\nhas made it clear he won't tolerate such abuse. \n\n \n\nBut there is merit too in the position taken by those who support\nthe mayor 's renewed campaign. \n\n \n\nAmong them is the Philippine Constitutional Association.\n\n\nThe group takes another tack, saying that  \" the\nconstitutional mandate ( Article II-Section 15) requiring the State to\nprotect and promote the right of health of the people and instill health\nconsciousness among them, must include the duty to warn the people of\nproducts, places and conditions that may be injurious to their health.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nIn defending Mayor Lim, Philconsa says the Constitution is a\n \" dynamic organ formulated to protect the citizens from forces\nthat wage virtual war against the life, the health and safety of the people.\n\n\n\nIt cannot, and must not be used as a shield by elements engaged in\nthe destruction of society. &rdquo;  \n\n\nThus,  \" the rights of the victims of drug addiction\ndeserve a higher priority than the rights of those who invoke the principle\nof due process. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nWe take the view - - as do many others who feel that the drug\nproblem has clearly gone out of control - - that the State has the\nprerogative to resort to extraordinary measures when clearly warranted by\npublic interest. \n\n \n\nBut having said that, we also must urge authorities to exercise\nextreme caution in enforcing the law.\n\n\nThe unfortunate incident that resulted in the killing of Polly\nLacson, an eight-year old girl killed by police manning a checkpoint near the\nresidence of a businessman suspected of involvement in illicit drugs,\ndemonstrates the extent to which the stepped-up anti-drugs campaign could go\n- - completely awry - - if there are no adequate safeguards against abuses by\nlaw enforcers. \n\n \n\nGiven our experience with martial law, we don't feel comfortable\nendorsing a strategy that would be open to police abuse.\n\n\nBut we believe in the analysis that the drug problem has become so\nserious, it requires extraordinary solutions. \n\n\n  'Che' lives  \n\n \n\nRELENTLESSLY pursued by the military regimes in Latin America as\na threat to their rule and detested even by hardcore Marxists-Leninists for\n\" romanticizing &rdquo; revolution during his brief lifetime, Ernesto\n\" Che &rdquo; Guevarra in death looms as a towering figure of the\nrebellious decade of the Sixties, if not of the entire 20th century. \n\n \n\nThe skeletal remains of the late guerrilla leader were recently\nretrieved in Bolivia, where he died in 1967, and brought to Cuba.\n\n\nThere, Fidel Castro has given his remains the proper homage befitting\na national hero. \n\n \n\nGuevarra was born on June 14, 1928 in Rosario, Argentina.\n\n\nHe was the eldest of five children in a middle-class family.\n\n\nThough troubled by asthma, he excelled as an athlete and a scholar,\ncompleting his medical studies in 1953.\n\n\nSeeing the conditions of poverty of the people in Latin America\nconvinced him that violent revolution was the only path to their\nemancipation. \n\n \n\nThat conviction made him decide to join Fidel Castro in waging\nthe Cuban revolution to a successful conclusion in 1959 and helping out the\nMarxist government.\n\n\nIn April 1965, he dropped out of public life to go Congo with other\nCuban guerrilla fighters to organize a guerrilla force there. \n\n \n\nIn late 1966, Guevarra went to Bolivia  incognito\n to lead a guerrilla force.\n\n\nOn October 8, 1967, however, the group was almost annihilated by the\nBolivian army.\n\n\nGuevarra was captured alive.\n\n\nHis captors cut off both his hands and shot him soon afterward. \n\n \n\nGuevarra 's revolutionary career may have been brief, but he left\nbehind a body of written works that are read with much interest and awe by\nleftist and progressive movements everywhere.\n\n\nToday, he is a revered 60s figure who stands as a symbol of\nrebellion.\n\n\nIf, 30 years after his death, Che 's memory lives on in the minds of\nall those who have at one time or another raised a clenched fist against\nestablished authority, it is because he personifies the conviction that\nsocial change knows no boundaries. \n\n \n\nA radical theoretician said more than a hundred years ago that\n \" it is not enough to understand the world, the point is to\nchange it. &rdquo; \n\n\nBut we have Che Guevarra - - and other men and women who made the\nsupreme sacrifice for change - - to thank for making it possible for the\nenterprise of changing the world to be as urgent today as it was more than a\ncentury ago.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "3a4eb48b-5646-4c80-9bae-08d2eb037e8f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.329478+00:00"}
{"text": "A candle for Lola Rosa  \n\n \n\nMARIA ROSA Luna Henson led a life that could not have been lived\nby anyone of lesser stuff. \n\n \n\nHer tragedy, as she herself had described simply and\nheartbreakingly in her autobiography, began even before she was born.\n\n\nHer mother Julia was the daughter of a tenant farmer.\n\n\nTo help feed the large Luna brood, Julia worked as maid for the\nlandlord and, against her will, bore his child.\n\n\nThe illegitimate daughter, Maria Rosa, would later turn out to be the\nsingle reason why her mother held on to life and sanity. \n\n \n\nWith the circumstances of her birth and poverty explained to her\nearly on, Maria Rosa was determined to make something of herself.\n\n\nShe wanted to become a doctor, and she took the steps toward this by\nstriving to become the valedictorian in her class. \n\n \n\nFor a while, there seemed to be a way out of misery.\n\n\nAnd then, war struck.\n\n\nMaria Rosa, then 14, became one of the war 's first casualties. \n\n \n\nWhile this period of her life would be known to most Filipinos as\nthe time she had suffered as a sex slave to the occupying forces, it was also\nthe time when she exercised many other acts of heroism.\n\n\nMaria Rosa had joined the resistance movement, the  Hukbalahap\n .\n\n\nIt was in the course of performing a task for the underground\norganization--while delivering for the guerrillas guns and ammunition hidden\nunder a cartful of corn--that she was taken by the Japanese and forced to\nbecome what would be referred to as a \" \" comfort woman.\n&rdquo; \"\n\n\nShe suffered the slavery for nine months. \n\n \n\nDespite the humiliation, the pain and the dark uncertainty that\nher life as a hostage brought to her, Maria Rosa still found time for more\ncourage.\n\n\nWhile she herself could not yet be saved, she found no obstacle to\ntrying to save others--on one occasion, the village of Pampang in her home\nprovince in Pampanga.\n\n\nAfter overhearing Japanese officers discussing their plan to burn\ndown the village, Maria Rosa conveyed the information to one of the \nbarrio  residents.\n\n\nThe villagers escaped, and the Japanese turned their wrath on their\nsuspected informer, Maria Rosa.\n\n\nIt was the torture chamber for her until the guerrillas finally found\nand freed her. \n\n \n\nEven after the war, life refused to take a quiet turn for this\nwoman who had taken more than her share of trials and tribulations.\n\n\nMarriage did not work out too well with a man whose nobility of cause\nin the  Hukbalahap  did not match his personal character.\n\n\nShe raised her three children alone, washing other people 's clothes\nand working in a factory. \n\n \n\nShe would have gone on with her steady, silent survival but one\nday, a non-government organization went on radio calling on all \"\n\" comfort women &rdquo; \" who suffered during the Japanese\noccupation to come forward and claim justice. \n\n \n\nThe memories came back to Maria Rosa and tormented her.\n\n\nFinally, she decided.\n\n\nShe would be tormented no more.\n\n\nShe stood up, held up her life as a victim of inhumanity and demanded\njustice. \n\n \n\nOn August 18, Maria Rosa died, her quest for justice not quite\nwon.\n\n\nShe had won public attention to her plight and those of hundreds of\nother women similarly brutalized by Japanese soldiers.\n\n\nBut reparation and remorse from those that violated her had been slow\nand niggardly.\n\n\nOne wonders if, in the tortuous language that carried the apologies\nof the Japanese government, Maria Rosa 's tormentors had truly asked for her\nforgiveness.\n\n\nEven from that, however, she would save them the trouble. \n\n \n\n\n \" I had learned to accept suffering. \n\n\nI also learned to forgive, &rdquo;  she said in her book.\n\n\n \n\nAs a Filipino, a woman and a human being, Maria Rosa 's heroism\nwill be hard to equal, let alone surpass.  \n\n\n\n\n  Neither the center nor the fringe holds  \n\n \n\nSEN. Benigno \" Ninoy &rdquo; Aquino Jr. must be turning in\nhis grave as the nation commemorated his 14th death anniversary yesterday.\n\n\nThe country he so loved served and died for is in a state of virtual\npolitical turmoil, and confusion. \n\n \n\nOn the eve of yesterday 's celebration, His Eminence Jaime\nCardinal Sin called on Filipinos to stage a second people power revolt\nagainst the Ramos administration, which, he said,  \" has lost\nthe people 's trust and respect. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThe Cardinal displayed this loss of trust and respect for the\nhighest official of the land with his stinging criticisms:  \n\" This President seeks not to lead us into the enlightened political\nstability, social stability and prosperity of the next millennium.\n\n\nHe seeks rather to lead us back into the dark ages of pre-martial\nlaw political dynasties, warlordship, corruption, sham democracy, and\ndebilitating poverty. &rdquo;   \n\n \n\nThe influential Archbishop of Manila just could not believe that\nPresident Ramos has nothing to do with the sustained attacks on the\nConstitution to lift term limits.\n\n\nTo the question which is foremost in everyone 's mind--Why does\nnobody believe the President when he says he will not stay any minute longer\nin his post after his six-year term ends on June 30, 1998?--the Cardinal\nprovided the answer.\n\n\n \" No one believes him because his own people do not\nbelieve him, &rdquo;  he said. \n\n \n\nPro-Charter-change advocates may fault the outspoken prelate for\nagain meddling in purely political affairs, but there is no doubt that the\nCardinal articulated the thoughts, concerns and fears of many Filipinos most\nsuccinctly. \n\n \n\nIn Mindanao, Nur Misuari led 400 government officials to a 10-day\ncaravan to key cities and provinces in the region to gather signatures aimed\nat amending the Charter and extending the term of President Ramos.\n\n\nNo less than Misuari 's man admitted that the budget department was\nbankrolling the activity, a revolting deed made more scandalous by the\nthought that the money used to fund the caravan could have made the lives of\nthe most recent calamity victims less miserable. \n\n \n\nAt the House of Representatives, pro-administration solons with\nmore than enough support from members of the opposition added fuel to the\nfire and breathe life into the Charter-change project.\n\n\nNationalist People 's Coalition members, who voted in favor of\nreporting out for plenary discussion House Concurrent Resolution No. 40 which\nseeks to convene Congress into a constituent assembly, claimed they were\nstill against Charter amendments but that they did not want to deprive the\npeople a chance to hear them speak on such an important issue. \n\n \n\nThe argument is pure double-talk.\n\n\nNPC solons can talk themselves to death and win the hearts of every\nfreedom-loving Filipino, but there is no way they can get Charter-change\ndie-hards to their side.\n\n\nThe opposition knows this so all talk about defeating CR 40 in a\ndebate is nothing but another insult to the intelligence of the Filipino\npeople. \n\n \n\nThe moves to amend the Charter, which started as early as 1993,\nhave not advanced the common good one bit.\n\n\nIt has only tarnished the credibility of the government and divided\nthe entire nation.\n\n\nAnd yet instead of putting his foot down, President Ramos could only\nsay:  \" If they ( legislators) are deaf in their ears, I will\nhave to shout a little harder. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThe point is neither the center nor the fringe holds.\n\n\nNeither the Ramos administration nor the political opposition is\nbeing forthright about their intentions.\n\n\nInstead, what is unfolding before our eyes is a shadow play most\ntragic because only one thing is clear in the here and now--the lines are\nbeing drawn between those who seek to uphold the Constitution and democracy,\nand those who want to now destroy it. \n\n \n\nFormer President Corazon Aquino, Mr. Ramos ' political godmother,\nyesterday said if her husband, Ninoy, were alive he would resist the move to\namend the Charter because he believed no elective official should use the\nConstitution to perpetuate himself in power.\n\n\nThe tragedy is Ninoy is dead, and is perhaps turning in his grave.\n \n\n\n\n\n  Rising to the occasion  \n\n \n\nNOW comes the Senate Electoral Tribunal ( SET) adding one more\nstraw on our backs.\n\n\nDisclosing the initial results of its recount of votes cast in the\n1995 elections, it has confirmed that  \" there was cheating in\nthe elections and, perhaps, massive fraud. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nFilipinos can take comfort in the fact that justice is somehow\nbeing dispensed.\n\n\nSomehow, something is being done to heed the call of someone whose\nvoice does not count for much in the political future of those tasked with\nconducting the recount. \n\n \n\nBut it is justice so terribly slow that it threatens to become\nuseless, and so expensive that it is almost unattainable.\n\n\nIt will take the release of &peso;400 million and at least two years\nto complete the recount.\n\n\nIn the words of a member of the tribunal, the process may even last\nwell beyond the term of office of the senator whose election has been put in\nquestion.\n\n\nIf and when justice is finally attained, nothing--literally and\nfiguratively--is left to the senator who should have won. \n\n \n\nBut if the words of Aquilino Pimentel Jr. are to be taken\nseriously, it is not the proclaimed winner who stands to gain most from the\ngrueling, frustrating exercise but the Filipino people.\n\n\nIf the election protest is pursued to its glorious end, it just might\nrestore some sanctity to a political exercise that has been dragged\nrepeatedly to mud. \n\n \n\nWere we to have the energy to do just that, there is, however,\none other problem raised by the SET 's initial findings and this concerns the\nCommission on Elections.\n\n\nIf the election officials that presided over the 1995 elections will\nbe the same ones taking charge in 1998, what kind of elections will we have?\n\n\nWill it be of the same quality as the 1995 polls? \n\n \n\nTo be sure, there is nothing in the law that requires any of our\nCOMELEC officials to cause themselves to take a less active part in next year 's\nelections in the light of the SET 's partial findings, just as there is\nnothing in the law that requires Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile to give way to\nanybody until the electoral tribunal has given its final judgment and\ndeclares another candidate as winner. \n\n \n\nBut just as Enrile may have to bear the burden of a victory under\na cloud, the COMELEC officials concerned--if they choose to do nothing in the\nwake of the SET announcement--will have to endure the onus of soldiering on\ndespite a reputation that is less than respectable.\n\n\nWags will say that the burden will be heavy only on those with a\nsense of shame, but that may be saying too much. \n\n \n\nAnd yet, the dirty end of the stick is going to be\nheld--again--by the Filipino people.\n\n\nAlready troubled by the uncertainty of an election next year because\nof the relentless efforts of incumbent elective officials to lift their term\nlimits through a constitutional amendment, the public is being made to see\nthat it is caught between the devil and the deep blue sea.\n\n\nEven if Charter-change proponents are defeated or just temporarily\nthwarted, where is the sense of celebration in having an election that will,\nin all likelihood, be dishonest? \n\n \n\nIt is a problem that can frustrate the hardiest soul.\n\n\nUnless, of course, ordinary Filipinos are again able to rise to the\noccasion and prove themselves more creative than those they have put in\npower. \n\n \n\nDidn't we say before that we have had enough of old-style\npolitics?\n\n\nWe should remind our leaders about this, and remind them well. \n\n\n\n\n\n  What gives, Mr. Torres?  \n\n \n\nJUST what is it with him? \n\n \n\nLast week, \" THE TIMES \" reported that Executive\nSecretary Ruben Torres reversed another decision of the Department of\nAgrarian Reform, and approved a landowner 's application for exemption from\nthe land reform law. \n\n \n\nTo this day, despite the uproar created by his series of\nreversals of DAR decisions, the \" Little President &rdquo; has chosen\nto side-step the issue. \n\n \n\nAsked to comment on the reports, Torres said the farmers--the 'fringes'\nof society?--were just being  \" too noisy. &rdquo; \n\n\nThe decisions, he said without elaborating, are still pending in his\noffice and have not been acted upon.\n\n\nHe 's begging for public understanding, he said, because if he sided\nwith the farmers, the landowners would do the same  \" noise.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nAnd the trouble with these farmers, Mr. Torres told reporters, is\nthat they go directly to the media to complain. \n\n \n\nWell, Mr. Torres, what should they have done as a recourse?\n\n\nSet an appointment with you? \n\n \n\nThe executive secretary is not being forthright when he says the\ndecisions are still pending in his office.\n\n\nThey are pending because right after he reversed the DAR decisions,\nthe department immediately filed an appeal with him.\n\n\nIt 's not as if he hasn't decided on these cases.\n\n\nThe DAR was merely asking him to rethink his position, asking him to\nstudy again his basis for reversing the department 's rulings. \n\n \n\nAnd these 'noisy' groups have another complaint against him.\n\n\nWith his decision to convert a 53-hectare land in Rizal into a golf\ncourse, Torres is being asked, didn't he anticipate the problems his actions\nwould create on the water situation in the metropolis? \n\n \n\nThe location of the disputed land is strategic to the water\nsupply in Metro Manila.\n\n\nTorres ' latest reversal of a DAR ruling would pave the way for the\nbuilding of a 36-hectare golf course that, farmers say, would naturally\ndamage the watershed area nearby. \n\n \n\nBut any expert can always debunk the farmers ' claim.\n\n\nEven Torres can dismiss this, with valid arguments, as nothing but\nanother leftist propaganda. \n\n \n\nBut he would be missing the point entirely. ...", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "e0cde5c8-893d-4ade-92e0-86532b13311f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.330717+00:00"}
{"text": "Ford returns  \n\n \n\nTHE giant American car manufacturer, Ford Motor Company, has\nannounced it will return to the Philippine market after a 15-year absence.\n\n\nThe manner of its reentry into the local market has spawned a\ncontroversy in the automotive industry.\n\n\nNevertheless the company 's announcement of plans to set up a\n&peso;4.18-billion car assembly and parts manufacturing plant in Laguna is a\ntimely endorsement of the country 's efforts to become a major destination of\ndirect foreign investments. \n\n \n\nTwo years ago, the Philippines lost out when another American car\nmaker, General Motors Corp., chose Thailand as the site of its\n&dollar;750-million manufacturing plant.\n\n\nGMC 's decision was a big blow on our morale and many people then\nbelieved it also damaged our capability to attract investors from abroad.\n\n\n \n\nBut as the currency crisis in Asia begins to unravel, the\nPhilippines has come out stronger than expected.\n\n\nWhile our neighbors are bogged down by the complexities of the fallout\nfrom severe currency depreciation, the Philippines has showed remarkable\nresiliency and its attractiveness as an investment haven has been enhanced.\n\n\n \n\nFord 's return to the Philippines engenders the hope that other\nbig foreign investors would follow.\n\n\nTrade Secretary Cesar Bautista said two other car makers have\nexpressed interest to set up manufacturing plants in the country under the\nsame incentives given to the US car maker. \n\n \n\nThe Philippine Economic Zone Authority said Ford has been given\nthree incentives: 5 percent gross annual income tax rate compared to the\nusual 35 percent; exemption from taxes on imported machinery and equipment;\nand deduction in tax payments for half of the company 's personnel training.\n\n\nPEZA oversees the special investment area where the plant will be\noperating. \n\n \n\nOfficials said the company 's operations are expected to begin in\nSeptember next year.\n\n\nIt will offer in the market the Ford Laser, Ranger Double Cab and\nEconovan Bus.\n\n\nThe company 's output will be  \" totally domestic\nmarket-oriented &rdquo;  during the initial years of operation but it\nis looking forward to exports in the near future, officials said. \n\n \n\nLocal car assemblers have objected to the incentives offered by\nthe government to Ford because it would  \" slant the playing\nfield clearly in favor of one participant ( of the government automotive\nprogram. &rdquo; \n\n\n) The Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines, in a\nletter to Bautista, said:  \" We see no compelling reasons... [\nfor] granting special incentives to Ford for assembly operations when\napparently their only major added commitment is a large export projection\nthat is obviously subject to market conditions which may or may not happen.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nBut Bautista said the country needs an integrated automotive\nmanufacturing venture to enhance the competitiveness of the local industry,\nespecially its export-oriented parts-making facilities.\n\n\nThe Board of Investments also said it is drafting changes to the\ncountry 's Motor Vehicle Development Program, which was last revised two\nyears ago.\n\n\nThe changes include waiving the local content requirement on locally\nassembled cars for assemblers earning at least &dollar;200 million from\nexports, and an easing down of the &dollar;10-million minimum investment\nrequirements. \n\n \n\nThe changes would hopefully improve our competitiveness in the\nglobal village.\n\n\nAccording to a study made by the United Nations Conference on Trade\nand Development and the International Chamber of Commerce ( ICC), the\nconfidence of the multinational companies in Asia has remained unshaken\ndespite the currency turmoil.\n\n\nThe study, which included a poll among 500 companies in the region,\nshowed that investments will remain and perceptions of prospects are\nunchanged. \n\n \n\nThe study could be seen as an open invitation to investors to\ncome to the Philippines. \n\n\n \" This is a resounding vote of confidence on the\neconomic fundamentals of East and Southeast Asia and the region 's long-term\nprospects. \n\n\nBusinesses still see enormous investment opportunities to be derived\nfrom the projected growth of Asian markets, &rdquo;  said ICC\nSecretary General Maria Livanos Cattaui. \n\n \n\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations, of which the\nPhilippines is a member, said in a recent announcement it was ready to grant\n\" pre-approvals &rdquo; to companies that are not yet operating in the\nregion under its ASEAN Industrial Cooperation ( AICO) program.\n\n\nUnder the program, participating firms can avail of such incentives\nas preferential tariff of zero to 5 percent for their raw and intermediate\nmaterial requirements. \n\n \n\nCurt Magleby, Ford 's director for ASEAN affairs, has said the\ncompany plans to expand its research in the region by riding on the AICO\nbandwagon.\n\n\n \" By using AICO and the ASEAN Free Trade Area in our\nplanning base, we can develop more efficient operations in ASEAN to meet the\nlong-term challenges of competition and trade liberalization, &rdquo;\n he said.  \n\n\n\n\n  Mudslinging and threats  \n\n \n\nWITH the unusually large number of presidential candidates in the\ncoming elections, 11 in all but seemingly narrowing down to Vice President\nJoseph \" Erap &rdquo; Estrada and Speaker Jose de Venecia, one would\nthink the virulence of the muckraking now in progress would also be\nsubsiding. \n\n \n\nBut the contrary appears to be happening.\n\n\nIn fact, the mudslinging has become so venomous that the charges and\ncountercharges are losing much of the credibility that they had at the start.\n\n\nWhich should be good except that the people are getting more\nconfused. \n\n \n\nTo be sure, smear campaigns have always been part of Philippine\nelections.\n\n\nIn the past, however, these were tolerable.\n\n\nBut today they seem to be getting out of control, unbearable, even\ntruly dangerous.\n\n\nAnd the saddest part of all is that the people do not seem to be\naware of the dangers that the practice poses. \n\n \n\nVisions of the future, programs to achieve them and issues\nconfronting the nation used to be the bases for the people 's choice of\nrepresentatives in government, from president down to the lowly municipal\ncouncilor.\n\n\nNow, character assassination, defamation and outright criminal\ncharges against the opponent have taken over this function. \n\n \n\nFrom Day One of the election contest, meaning when both Estrada\nand De Venecia were perceived as serious presidential candidates, the battle\nof verbal barbs started, initially almost in friendly fashion, then slowly\nturned bitter and disquieting. \n\n \n\nThe supporters of the Speaker intensified their attacks on Erap 's\nunintentional murder of the English language and alleged ignorance in many\nimportant matters, including economics, and the Veep 's drumbeats started\nexhuming old charges against the Speaker.\n\n\nIt was not, however, until President Ramos endorsed the Speaker 's\ncandidacy and Erap won the presidential nomination of an alliance of two\nopposition parties that the two camps went at each other 's jugular. \n\n \n\nThe most serious blow was delivered against the Vice President by\nthe Speaker 's camp, now headed by the President himself.\n\n\nA former drinking buddy and trusted deputy of Erap when he was\nchairman of the Presidential Anti-Crime Commission came out with the charge\nthat the Vice President had plotted to assassinate President Ramos after\ntheir election in 1992. \n\n \n\nThe \" bomb, &rdquo; although tainted by vengeance because\nErap 's accuser, police Senior Superintendent Reynaldo Berroya, was sent to\njail for more than four years at the PACC chairman 's initiative, was not\nentirely incredible.\n\n\nBerroya claimed he was asked three times by Erap to liquidate Ramos;\nlater a member of the Presidential Security Group announced he was willing to\ncorroborate the supposed existence of plot. \n\n \n\nIn retaliation, a three-part excerpt of a book written by two\nreporters of the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism on the\nsupposed anomalous contract between the Public Estates Authority and the\nAmari Coastal Bay Resources Corporation, which implicated top government\nofficials, including the President and the Speaker, appeared simultaneously\nin most of Manila 's daily newspapers, presumably at the instigation of the\nVice President 's camp. \n\n \n\nThe supposed multibillion-peso Amari scandal was formally\ninvestigated for several months by the Senate, the House of Representatives\nand Malaca&ntilde;ang but nothing came out of these probes.\n\n\nHowever, the charges and countercharges pertaining to the Berroya and\nAmari cases continue unabated, except that in the latter the brunt of the\naccusations have been shifted to Mr. Ramos and away from Speaker de Venecia.\n\n\n \n\nIn the same manner, the charges of alleged efforts of the\nadministration to frustrate the coming elections so Mr. Ramos can remain in\noffice indefinitely continues to be peddled by the opposition to the\nunsuspecting public.\n\n\nThe latest to make the charge was reelectionist Senator Freddie Webb,\nwho claimed Malaca&ntilde;ang was planning to use a resurgence of the\ncommunist and Muslim insurrections to justify a failure of elections. \n\n \n\nOther oppositionists who had earlier warned of No-El or no\nelections included former Senate President Ernesto Maceda, who is running for\nmayor of Manila.\n\n\nAmong other things, according to Maceda, the administration was\nallegedly using the Commission on Elections to thwart the holding of the\npolls. \n\n \n\nHe cited the bungling of the COMELEC, including the allegedly\nirregular printing of election returns forms by a private firm that could at\nthe least postpone the elections if the forms are not ready by election day,\nthe \" botched &rdquo; computerization plan, and the attempt to oust the\nCatholic clergy from participating in the election \" quick count\n&rdquo; of the National Movement for Free Elections as proof that\nMalaca&ntilde;ang was out to sabotage the elections. \n\n \n\nAll these warnings of a failure of elections, to our thinking,\nare designed merely to gain publicity mileage by those who tout them.\n\n\nThey must be their answer to the ban on political advertising in\nprint and electronic media. \n\n \n\nThese should be harmless exercises, except that they exacerbate\nthe problem of the electorate being horribly uninformed or misinformed when\nthey choose their officials.\n\n\nIt is not politically healthy when people have nothing to consider\nbut defamation, vilification and slander when they cast their ballots. \n\n \n\nIt is time our political leaders go back to their vision for the\nnation, their programs of government, and the issues confronting the nation\nas the bases for the people to select their representatives to government.\n\n\n \n\nIf they continue with their muckraking and warnings of possible\nbloodshed from a failure of elections, our leaders can only succeed in the\nelection of personalities unprepared to run the government, in short a\nmediocre administration.  \n\n\n\n\n  Sounds familiar  \n\n \n\nOVERSHADOWED by the more visceral issues in the run up to the May\n11 national elections is the exit of the Philippines from 35 years of\nInternational Monetary Fund ( IMF) tutelage and control.\n\n\nMany people are seemingly unaware of the significance of our country\nbecoming free from IMF supervision because the nation 's attention is mainly\nfocused on the polls. \n\n \n\nHouse of Representatives Speaker Jose de Venecia, who is the\nRamos administration candidate for president, has announced in Hong Kong that\nthe Philippines has exited from IMF control at the weekend and is now moving\ntoward full economic independence.\n\n\nHe told a gathering of fund managers coming from different parts of\nthe world that the Philippines would implement measures, including bringing\ndown interest rates at least one percent every week, to animate the business\nclimate in the country. \n\n \n\n \" We are graduating from being Asia 's basket case\nas some of the most powerful economic tigers in the region have come under\nstringent IMF controls, &rdquo;  De Venecia told the Credit\nSuisse-First Boston Asian Investment Conference. \n\n\n \" We are celebrating this year 100 years of political\nindependence.\n\n\nAfter 35 years under IMF control, the Philippines is now free\neconomically. &rdquo;   \n\n \n\nDue to its ailing economy, the Philippines had been dependent on\nIMF assistance to get through its financial troubles.\n\n\nIn exchange, it has had to comply with stringent requirements imposed\nby the Fund. \n\n \n\nSome of the IMF requirements had a major impact on such official\ndecisions as interest rates and procedures involved in business loans.\n\n\nIn many instances, the interest of the country became subordinate to\nthe interest of the Fund.\n\n\nAs a result, the IMF became a favorite \" whipping boy &rdquo;\nof activists and anti-administration groups. \n\n \n\nWhile De Venecia was addressing the fund managers in Hong Kong, a\nrowdy group of protesters gathered outside the US Embassy in Manila\ndenouncing the United States and the IMF which, they claimed, were\nresponsible for the Asian financial crisis.\n\n\n \" The US and its global financial and trade instruments\nsuch as the IMF... are the real culprits behind the economic crises that hit\nthe country and the whole of East Asia, &rdquo;  said a statement\nhanded out at the rally. \n\n \n\nThe demonstration followed reports that about 43,000 people could\nlose their jobs in the first six months of 1998, as industries are forced to\nslash jobs as a result of severe currency depreciation that hit the\nPhilippines and the other Asian countries in the past several months.\n\n\nCompanies blame the peso depreciation, high production costs, lack of\noperating capital and shortage of raw materials as the cause of the job cuts.\n\n\n \n\nThe government has put up a &peso;200-million loan fund for the\ndisplaced workers.\n\n\nEmployee Compensation Commission Executive Director Teofilo Hebron\nsaid each laid-off worker will be given a maximum of &peso;12, 500 soft loan.\n\n\n \" The loan shall be payable within two years in equal\nmonthly installments and which payment shall start after one year or 12\nmonths moratorium following the date of the loan release, &rdquo; \nHebron said. \n\n \n\nDespite the unsettling reports, the Philippines looks forward to\nbetter prospects in the year ahead.\n\n\nFinancial officials from 14 economies attending the Asia-Pacific\nBankers Congress in Manila said they believe the Philippines will emerge with\na stronger economy after the crisis. \n\n \n\nThe officials, who are deputy finance ministers and deputy\ncentral bank governors, called for the adoption of  \" sound\neconomic and financial policies, coupled with appropriate structural reforms\n&rdquo;  in Asian nations plagued by sluggish growth.\n\n\n \" Overall, deputies felt that substantial progress has\nbeen made toward a resolution of the Asian financial crisis, although\nimportant policy challenges remain, &rdquo;  they said in a\nstatement. \n\n \n\nA footnote in the talks was the result of negotiations between\nthe IMF and the Philippines ' three Asian neighbors: South Korea, Thailand\nand Indonesia.\n\n\nAs a result of the economic slump set off by a wave of rapid currency\ndevaluations, the three countries have been forced to accept bailouts\norchestrated by the IMF. \n\n \n\nPress reports said the IMF has delayed payment of a\n&dollar;3-billion installment of Indonesia 's &dollar;43-billion total aid\npackage until at least next month, pending the outcome of talks to revise the\nterms of the bailout.\n\n\nDoesn't it sound familiar?\n\n\nThe Philippines used to grapple with the problem only a few years\nago.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6683d8fb-6d47-4228-b823-c95341618156", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.331983+00:00"}
{"text": "'Less talk, less mistake'   \n\n \n\nTHE office of the Press Secretary is apparently implementing at\nthis point a policy of  'less talk, less mistake'  as part of\nits strategy to reinvent President Estrada and arrest the drastic drop in his\npopularity ratings. \n\n \n\nThis is both good and bad. \n\n \n\nGood because in the first place, the President 's grasp of many\nissues is severely circumscribed by his limited academic preparation for the\njob.\n\n\nEven if Mr. Estrada can say he is qualified to serve as President\nbecause he has risen from the ranks from town mayor to senator and Vice\nPresident before he assumed the highest position in the land, his capacity to\ndissect profound issues from an intellectual viewpoint seems to be in serious\ndoubt.\n\n\nThe long and the short of it is that we have a President who is far\nfrom cerebral, and tends to respond to issues at gut-level.\n\n\nHence, the  'less talk, less mistake'  policy is apt,\nand is a good move that will keep him from putting his foot in his mouth far\ntoo often, with disastrous consequences not just for his image but that of\nthe nation as well. \n\n \n\nBut it is also bad because the people - the very ones who voted\nhim into office - expect him to do the talking for them.\n\n\nThat is, they expect Mr. Estrada to clarify for them how the Mindanao\ncrisis should be handled, what the economic managers are doing to improve the\neconomy, and where the nation is headed.\n\n\nIf the Cabinet secretaries and their subalterns are the ones\ndefending the government 's stand on these and other vital issues, the\nPresident 's image as the leader of the nation is considerably diminished.\n\n\nThe  'less talk, less mistake'  posture may be needed\nto keep the President 's off-the-cuff - and often off-kilter - comments on\nimportant issues in check, but we 're afraid it merely reinforces the notion\nthat the electorate voted into office someone whose intellectual capacity and\ncompetence to lead the nation forward are severely wanting. \n\n \n\nThe  'less talk, less mistake'  policy may be good\nfrom the point of view of reviving the President 's popularity ratings, but\nit spells disaster for the nation when the clear need is for a leader who can\narticulate the aspirations of our people and solve their problems. \n\n \n\nWe do not need a President who does not want to talk about the\nproblems of cronyism and corruption in the country because he is likely to\nsay the wrong things. \n\n \n\nWe need a President who is forthright and firm in saying that he\nwill combat cronyism and corruption without fear or favor. \n\n \n\nWe need a President who can tell us in clear terms what must be\ndone to arrest the decline of the economy, and how poverty must be\neradicated. \n\n \n\nIn other words, we need a President who can talk sense because he\nis on the side of truth.  \n\n\n\n\n  Rational Metro development  \n\n \n\nHOW to realize the vision of making Metro Manila truly a\nworld-class metropolis? \n\n \n\nIf the Metro Manila Development Authority had its way, the city\ncan rationalize its development only if all funds and disbursements, as well\nas financing investment plans, are centralized in the agency. \n\n \n\n \" We are striving to integrate and synchronize the\nplanning and budgeting systems in the metropolis at all levels of government,\nfrom the national, the metro and down to the local level, &rdquo; \nsays MMDA chair Jejomar Binay. \n\n \n\nThe synchronization will include all annual investments in the\nNational Capital Region of all the cities and municipalities and the national\ngovernment.\n\n\nThis would be part of the Regional Development Plan for the National\nCapital Region. \n\n \n\nThe plan covers all the aspects of the development of Metro\nManila, which include utilities, roads, transport, flood control, land\ndevelopment, environment, social services, and development administration.\n\n\n \n\nAn integral component of the plan is the preparation of the Metro\nManila Investment Program.\n\n\nThis seeks direct control over the annual investment plans of\nnational agencies, cities and municipalities, especially on all\ninfrastructure projects. \n\n \n\nWhat the MMDA really wants to do is to synchronize all\ndevelopment efforts so that they converge in one direction: a Metro Manila\nthat we can all call our home.\n\n\nAs things now stand, we have pockets of affluence, surrounded by\nsquatter colonies; uncollected garbage; horrible traffic jams; severe air and\nwater pollution, to name just a few. \n\n \n\nWhile the centralization of planning and funding under the MMDA\nensures that taxpayers ' money only goes to priority socio-economic projects,\nwe doubt if the local government units would easily surrender their power\nover the purse.\n\n\nThe elected officials in the LGUs can always invoke the fact that,\nhaving been chosen by their constituents to serve them, they are in the best\nposition to determine what is best for them. \n\n \n\nWe believe that rational Metro development is possible only if\nboth national government agencies and LGUs in Metro Manila get their heads\ntogether and hammer out an integrated and coherent plan. \n\n \n\nBut it does not end there.\n\n\nThe key question is: Does the MMDA itself have the capability to\nimplement long-term development plans, given that its performance over the\nyears in giving us the city that we deserve certainly leaves much to be\ndesired?  \n\n\n\n\n  Untimely visit  \n\n \n\nPRESIDENT Joseph Estrada goes on a state visit to China with the\ndomestic front in turmoil. \n\n \n\nWhile a state visit such as this involves a lot of preparation\nand cannot be cancelled without affecting bilateral diplomatic relations in\nsome way or other, we believe the serious political crisis brought about by\nthe all-out war in Mindanao compounded by two hostage situations in Basilan\nand Sulu should have been prioritized by Malaca&ntilde;ang rather than our\nties with China. \n\n \n\nFrom where we sit, however, we do not see any possibility that\nthe Chinese would change their position on their claim to the Spratlys.\n\n\nThat is, if the issue is discussed at all during the visit.\n\n\nThe most that Mr. Estrada could probably get from his Chinese hosts\nis a guarantee that they are willing to continue talks for a peaceful\nresolution of the territorial dispute.\n\n\nThis is nothing new, however, because this is what the Chinese have\nbeen saying even as they continue strengthening their fortifications in the\nSpratlys. \n\n \n\nThe second item in the agenda of the visit is to encourage the\nChinese to invest in the Philippines.\n\n\nAnd for this reason, some 150 Fil-Chinese businessmen are said to be\npart of the presidential entourage.\n\n\nWe seriously doubt, however, if the Chinese are willing to bring\nmoney here when right in their own country they need the investments\nthemselves.\n\n\nChina has become a regional economic power not because its\nbusinessmen invest abroad but because many foreign companies have been\nattracted to make huge investments there.\n\n\nAnd we would not be surprised if it 's the other way around: that the\n150 Fil-Chinese businessmen who are accompanying the President would be\nenticed to invest in China.\n\n\nWith the unstable political situation in the Philippines at present,\nlocal businessmen cannot be faulted for looking elsewhere to put their\ninvestments. \n\n \n\nWe are not saying that the China visit is absolutely pointless.\n\n\nWe have no doubt that it will strengthen RP-China ties in both\npolitical and economic terms.\n\n\nBut weighed against the urgent need to address pressing domestic\nconcerns, specifically the Mindanao crisis, the state visit could have waited\nfor an opportune time - and achievable results.  \n\n\n\n\n  The cost of war  \n\n \n\nHOW much would it cost the government to win the war against the\n Moro  Islamic Liberation Front? \n\n \n\nAbout &peso;4 billion, according to the defense department and\nthe Armed Forces of the Philippines.\n\n\nOf that sum, &peso;2 billion would go to war materi\u00e9l, such as\nequipment and ammunition of government troops, and &peso;2 billion would go\nto the salaries and provisions of soldiers. \n\n \n\nHouse Minority Leader Sergio Apostol cites a much lesser figure,\nhowever.\n\n\nHe says only &peso;1.8 billion is enough to continue the offensive of\ngovernment troops, given an estimated total of 30,000 government soldiers\nfighting the MILF.\n\n\nAnd if the military runs out of funds to pursue the secessionist\nrebels, government can submit a request to Congress to supplement their\nbudget. \n\n \n\nWe can see here the big difference between what the military\nwants and what is deemed realistic by Congress.\n\n\nBy any measure, the &peso;.2 billion difference is a big sum that can\nbe used, for instance, to kickstart the socio-economic development of\nMuslim-dominated areas. \n\n \n\nDefense Secretary Orlando Mercado has revealed that as of now\nthey do not really know how much the government has already spent in the\nmilitary operation in Mindanao.\n\n\n \" We have not bothered to compute it because we 're\nbusy planning and thinking how we could stop the rebellion in the South.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThis revelation is consistent with his earlier statement to the\neffect that you do not put a price tag on the country 's territorial\nintegrity.\n\n\nThat might be true from the theoretical plane, but in reality the\nsoldiers cannot use up all the ammunition they want without considering that\nevery round costs money - taxpayer 's money - and that the national treasury\nis not inexhaustible.\n\n\nSomehow, the cost of war must be counted in pesos and centavos,\nbecause the same taxpayers ' money used in fighting a war can very well be\nused to securing the peace that Filipinos want. \n\n \n\nWe believe that it is correct to unleash the full might of the\nState against terrorist groups like the Abu Sayyaf who have the bad habit of\nkidnapping innocent civilians.\n\n\nBut obviously the government cannot be involved in a long drawn-out\nwar with the MILF while avenues to peace remain open. \n\n \n\nThe economics of war should tell us that peace is the better\noption.  \n\n\n\n\n  Rein them in  \n\n \n\nWITH close to 200 local and foreign journalists covering the\nhostage drama in Sulu - and most of the foreigners ' accounts painting a very\nnegative picture of the country - perhaps it is time for the government to\nput some semblance of order amid the chaos. \n\n \n\nThe foreign journalists who have descended in droves to Sulu may\nbe contributing to the problem instead of helping solve it.\n\n\nIn their eagerness to bring to the outside world what the hostages\nare going through, the foreign journalists are likely to criticize the\nPhilippine government and the military for their failure to end the crisis.\n\n\n \n\nBut that is not all.\n\n\nThere is a very real danger that the so-called \" 'lost\ncommands' \" of the  Moro  rebel groups could seize\nthe foreign journalists.\n\n\nGroups of intrepid journalists have been setting off on their own to\ngo to the Abu Sayyaf headquarters, causing undue worry and apprehension - to\nthe Philippine government and perhaps their own governments - that they too\nmight have been abducted. \n\n \n\nThe foreign journalists are also said to have offered the Abu\nSayyaf rebels money for the chance to interview the hostages.\n\n\nThis could unnecessarily prolong the crisis because the Abu Sayyaf\njust might milk the situation dry for all it 's worth - they need all the\nmoney they can get to sustain their terrorist activities. \n\n \n\nIn light of this, we suggest that authorities impose order in the\ncoverage of the hostage crisis.\n\n\nFirst, there should be daily briefings for the press by the\nofficially designated government spokesperson, so that the facts can be\nimmediately communicated to all concerned.\n\n\nWe have in mind something similar to what took place during the\nKosovo crisis, when NATO held such daily briefings for the press. \n\n \n\nSecond, it should be made clear that the government will not be\nresponsible for the safety of foreign journalists who wander off into the\njungle by themselves to interview the foreign hostages of the Abu Sayyaf.\n\n\n \n\nWe are not in any way asking that government restrict the\nmovement of the foreign journalists, much less the local ones.\n\n\nWhat we are suggesting is that government take firm steps to prevent\nfurther damage to the country 's already tarnished international reputation.\n\n\nIt is within government 's prerogative to set the rules regarding\ncoverage of a complicated situation.\n\n\nWhat is happening in the twin hostage crises in Basilan and Sulu must\nbe made known to the world - but at our own terms, not those of foreign media\norganizations.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "b8a9de95-707c-469f-8e1d-2cc20b3cb202", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.333431+00:00"}
{"text": "Brotherhood gone wrong  \n\n \n\nFraternities are organizations that were formed to foster\ncomradeship among civilized individuals from diverse cultures. \n\n \n\nYet recent tragic events saw parents lose their sons over\nsenseless loyalties and abusive initiation rites. \n\n \n\nThe fraternity war at the University of the Philippines in Diliman\nlast February claimed another boy 's life - that of  Alpha Phi Beta\n member Den Daniel Reyes from the rival camp of  Sigma Rho\n . \n\n \n\nSometime ago, some members of Ateneo 's  Aquila Legis\n were convicted by the Caloocan Regional Trial Court of having\nparticipated in initiation rites that led to the death of Lenny Villa.\n\n\nTheir appeal is still pending before a higher court. \n\n \n\nEven at the country 's premier military school, the Philippine\nMilitary Academy, there has been two reported hazing deaths. \n\n \n\nThree cases of maltreatment were also exposed last year.\n\n\nOne of the victims during that bizarre hazing - electrocuting the\nplebes - is now in a comatose state. \n\n \n\nA fraternity is supposed to instill in the minds of its members\nthe group 's ideals and philosophy which should help frat men become better\ncitizens who respect the rights and individualities of others and appreciate\ntheir self worth. \n\n \n\nSomething, however, is definitely wrong with the system.\n\n\nBrazen acts of violence are alarmingly on the rise.\n\n\nWhat is more chilling is the upswing of mob mentality among college\nand high school students. \n\n \n\nWhat triggers beastly behaviors among frat men when they\ninitially join the group to become part of an extended family?\n\n\nWhat makes fraternities appealing to young students? \n\n \n\nThe young people join fraternities for worthwhile causes, the\nneed to belong, to uphold a tradition set by parents and even secure contacts\nfor future career moves. \n\n \n\nStudents who sign up without asking questions or pondering the\nconsequences of joining fraternities should also be answerable for the\nactions they take. \n\n \n\nParents who push their children to follow their footsteps without\nconsidering their children 's needs should be made accountable for any\ntragedy that befalls the family. \n\n \n\nPeople in government may also be held culpable for conveying a\ncertain sense of materialism.\n\n\nThey are too preoccupied in associating with influential persons who\ncan later be considered assets since appointments in certain offices depend\non not what you know but who you know. \n\n \n\nBeing a member of the same fraternity appears to bear more weight\non the outcome of hiring or firing decisions.\n\n\nThis appears to penetrate into the consciousness of the youth. \n\n \n\nMore often than not, senior frat men are the perpetrators of the\nmess in which the group finds itself.\n\n\nBeing the elders in their organization, it is presumed they take it\nupon themselves to ensure no harm comes to their members and to keep their\norganization 's reputation intact.\n\n\nSadly, this is often not the case, for they, the leaders, usually\ninitiate the abuses. \n\n \n\nThere is also the possibility that fraternity leaders themselves\ncould have been the victims of abuse as well during their own initiation\nrites.\n\n\nThese senior frat men might have never fully recovered from the\nphysical pain and emotional torture they also had to endure.\n\n\nThe need to extract their revenge on the fledgling members could have\nbeen subconsciously nurtured through the years of silent suffering. \n\n \n\nWhen things go wrong, ambitions of parents, peer pressure, school\nofficials ' indifference, power tripping of fraternity leaders and the kids '\nlack of initiative to question the pros and cons of their actions, are\nblamed. \n\n \n\nA lot of questions may be left unanswered on the merits or\ndemerits of joining a fraternity. \n\n \n\nWar-freak individuals, although a minority, do more harm to the\nimage of the true meaning of brotherhood, specially when this free-for-all\ncauses the death or injury of a member. \n\n \n\nIs it worth joining a fraternity? \n\n \n\nThere is no clear-cut answer to this dilemma.\n\n\nAn individual is responsible for the actions he takes.\n\n\nHis need for joining a fraternity would depend on his convictions,\nneeds and level of maturity. \n\n \n\nFraternities are probably here to stay.\n\n\nBut hazing need not continue to exist.\n\n\nOur young leaders can make that choice and make the difference. \n\n\n\n\n\n  The people 's will  \n\n \n\nA little over a decade ago, Filipinos were one in their fight to\nreplace the dictatorship and restore democracy in their country. \n\n \n\nThey fought for, and won, democracy by staging an uprising in\nEdsa in 1986. \n\n \n\nToday we, the Filipino people, are enjoying the blessings of\ndemocracy.\n\n\nToday we are a people who can freely elect our political leaders.\n\n\n \n\nYet those at Edsa who claimed then that they were fighting for\ndemocracy are now crying for the ouster of a President who was elected in\n1998 in a clean and orderly election. \n\n \n\nA group, reportedly composed of former political activists, media\npersonalities, Makati-based businessmen and veterans of the Edsa revolt, with\nits spokesman Jose Luis Alcuaz, is mounting a \" silent protest &rdquo;\nagainst Mr. Estrada whom the group wants replaced, the \" \nPhilippine Daily Inquirer  \" bannered yesterday. \n\n \n\nAlcuaz hardly enjoys any social and political credibility.\n\n\nHe has been dismissed many times over in the past as a crackpot.\n\n\nWhy the \"  Inquirer  \" chose to banner a\nstory based on Alcuaz 's statements is baffling unless the paper has decided\nto come out openly as the Estrada opposition press. \n\n \n\nIt appears that it is not democracy the group wants restored but\na return to dictatorship; one where a small group imposes its will and\ndictates to the nation who it believes fit to lead the country. \n\n \n\nLike Mr. Estrada or not, he was the democratic choice of the\nFilipino people in 1998.\n\n\nThe people gave him a six-year mandate without any conditions\nattached, save for his being subject to impeachment for willful violation of\nthe Constitution. \n\n \n\nUnder constitutional rules, which the same \" yellow &rdquo;\n group designed, the President cannot be\nremoved from office except by impeachment or when the President is\npermanently disabled.\n\n\nThe President has the option to resign, but the decision to step down\nbefore his term is up is up to him - not any group 's decision. \n\n \n\nThe Alcuaz group says it wants Mr. Estrada replaced, by whom, the\ngroup does not say.\n\n\nHow it wants him replaced wasn't mentioned either.\n\n\nBut as the so-called campaign has the Edsa flavor, it appears that\nthe group 's way is the extra-constitutional way. \n\n \n\nUnder a dictatorial reign, this is perhaps understandable and\neven admissible, but it is ridiculous for the group to take the extra-legal\nroute under a democratic setup. \n\n \n\nDoes the group seek to replace Mr. Estrada through snap\npresidential elections?\n\n\nBut this route is an impossibility under the Constitution since the\nCharter mechanism for presidential succession is clear. \n\n \n\nOnly when both the vice president and the president resign\nsimultaneously can an election be called by Congress within 45-60 days to\nelect two new leaders of the nation. \n\n \n\nWithin that period of time, an adventurous military can take over\nthe reins of government, given a vacuum in congressional leadership. \n\n \n\nAnd then, we are back to a military regime and a dictatorship.\n\n\n \n\nAlcuaz says the group is done with Mr. Estrada.\n\n\nEnough of Estrada.\n\n\nNo more.\n\n\nReplace him.\n\n\nEstrada is floundering.\n\n\nStop cronyism, corruption and nepotism, the group 's \" silent\nprotest &rdquo; says. \n\n \n\nNotice that the group does not call for the resignation of Mr.\nEstrada, but a replacement. \n\n \n\nWhat system then does the group want to establish when it, under\na democracy, calls for Mr. Estrada to be replaced? \n\n \n\nThe replacement of a democratic system and the establishment of a\npolitical system where a minority decides how long a President should stay in\noffice? \n\n \n\nThe group 's true colors are showing.\n\n\nDemocracy was never its goal.\n\n\nA dictatorship, where the group 's members will regain position and\npower, is. \n\n \n\nThe Filipino people voted for Mr. Estrada to be the Philippine\npresident for six years. \n\n \n\nThe people 's will should never be thwarted. \n\n \n\nThat was what Edsa should have taught this group.  \n\n\n\n\n  Buying Power  \n\n \n\nIt does not shock the nation that congressmen were recipients of\nat least half a million pesos each in bribe and hush money for the passage of\nthe Omnibus Power Bill. \n\n \n\nIt is hardly a state secret that our congressmen can be bribed,\neven when the price is not quite right. \n\n \n\nOur congressmen hardly have a sterling reputation when it comes\nto selling out national interests in exchange for personal and vested\ninterests. \n\n \n\nIt is also not the first time our congressmen have been caught\nwith their hands in the cookie lobby jar.\n\n\nNot too long ago, in another Congress, largely made up of the same\nmembers, it was discovered that money made the rounds to get another bill\npassed. \n\n \n\nWhat disturbs, however, is that many of the whistle blowers of\nbribe practices in Congress invariably blurt this information to the media\nonly after the fact. \n\n \n\nIn Congress, as the Constitution states, three readings of any\nbill are required before its passage into law, whether this is performed in\nthe House or in the Senate. \n\n \n\nOn third and final reading, no amendment is allowed and a vote is\nimmediately taken, with the  yeas  and  nays\n entered in the journal. \n\n \n\nStated differently, the third reading of any bill is a formality\nonce a bill passes second reading. \n\n \n\nCongressmen, including the whistle blowers, are certainly aware\nof this constitutional requisite and they must have already been alerted to\nthe fact that whatever provisions were included in the Omnibus Power Bill on\nsecond reading would be no different when the third reading comes about. \n\n \n\nSo the money came after the passage of the bill and party list\ncandidates such as Representatives Renato Magtubo and Loretta Anne Rosales\nrevealed to the media that legislators were bribed into passing the power\nbill.\n\n\nThey had the money as evidence, to the photographers ' delight. \n\n \n\nThat money made the rounds in Congress is undeniable. \n\n \n\nBut what disturbs again, is the spin some of the whistle blowers\nplaced on the story. \n\n \n\nRosales and Magtubo admitted that as early as last week, word\nabout the bribe money had started to circulate a week before the House\napproved the bill. \n\n \n\nWhy then did not Rosales and Magtubo denounce this in a privilege\nspeech, if only to derail the passage of the power bill?\n\n\nMedia would certainly have given it a big play, enough for the power\nbill 's passage to be killed or, at the very least, delayed. \n\n \n\nRosales, who voted against the bill, also claimed that those who\nvoted for the bill 's passage probably got more than half a million.\n\n\nShe also claimed that while the money was being distributed in\nMinority Leader Felicisimo Belmonte 's office, she nevertheless believes the\nmoney came from House Speaker Manuel Villar. \n\n \n\nYet what evidence does Rosales have to prove her allegations that\nthe money came from Villar, specially when she herself admitted that she was\nhanded an envelope containing the money in the office of Belmonte. \n\n \n\nThis is not to say that the money could not have come from\nVillar.\n\n\nBut without any evidence to support her allegations, it is highly\nirresponsible for Rosales to make such a claim, specially as the envelopes\nwere being distributed in the office of Belmonte. \n\n \n\nWhy then make such a claim without first producing the evidence\nto support it?\n\n\nWhy did Rosales immediately clear Belmonte of such charges as though\nBelmonte did not know what was going on in his office and did not know as\nwell that his office, the distribution center, was awash with millions in\nbribe money for House members? \n\n \n\nIt is good that these members of the House exposed the bribery,\nbut it would have been better if they, for reasons of their own, proved\nthemselves to be more responsible lawmakers by first, blowing the whistle\nwhen word on the bribery practice went around before the second reading and\nsecond, after getting the evidence that was the bribe money, they had\npresented the facts to the media without putting their own political spin to\nit.  \n\n\n\n\n  Let the heavens fall  \n\n \n\nCongress has no choice but to insist on a full-scale\ninvestigation to be conducted by an independent probe body on the payola\nscandal attached to the third reading passage of the Omnibus Power Bill. \n\n \n\nFor Congress to do less will merely cause a disastrous erosion\nof the public 's trust and confidence in yet another government institution.\n\n\n \n\nIf the country and its democratic system of governance are to\nsurvive, Congress, the makers of the laws of the land, the representatives of\nthe people and the purse giver must undergo a public cleansing through a\nthorough and impartial investigation.\n\n\nAnd let the chips fall where they may. \n\n \n\nIn the course of a probe, it may be discovered that indeed, the\ninterested buyers of the National Power Corp. tempted legislators and their\nother friends in government with filthy lucre.\n\n\nReputations may be ruined, businesses may fold and political careers\nmay be destroyed, but the Congress, the nation and the democratic ways for\nwhich the Filipinos fought fiercely in 1986, will emerge the stronger for it.\n\n\n \n\nAnd it will have become a painful lesson learned by the present\nand future members of Congress - one mistake they may no longer want to\nrepeat when they remember the shame and the loss of respect of their\nconstituents for such acts unbecoming of a legislator and a public servant.\n ...", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "02a667ae-4265-460e-9414-47af730218e3", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.334591+00:00"}

\n\n \n\nThis is precisely the sort of puerile shit our editorial\ncondemned as racially characteristic and self-defeating.\n\n\nEvery time Filipinos face a big problem, the tendency is to sing\nsongs of unity.\n\n\nDoes anyone realize that what kills all the sheep is their tendency\nto herd together when led to the slaughter? \n\n \n\nThe point of our editorial is that we have to grow up. \n\n \n\nFaced with a currency crisis, we must brace ourselves for the\ndaunting task of finding elusive solutions pertaining to two things about\nwhich nobody has any certain ideas: our present problems and the real state\nof our country.\n\n\nThe National Economic and Development Authority lies all the time,\nthe state university is full of crap, and forget the businessmen.\n\n\nThey lie every morning to their wives.\n\n\nWhy would they hold back with their country? \n\n \n\nWe need, not to sing, but to understand the situation as it\nreally is and not as pet theories depict it.\n\n\nNobody predicted the crisis, except perhaps this newspaper, which\nstoutly dismissed economic trends over the past five years as a\nsmoke-and-mirrors act.\n\n\nThe UP School of Economics actually clamored for massive devaluation\non the peculiar theory that a cheaper peso will mean a richer country.\n\n\nThe difficulty of finding solutions is compounded in a country that\ndefies orthodox economics about cheapening currencies to boost exports.\n\n\nYou couldn't give away the crap we produce here except, of course,\nchildren to pedophiles. \n\n \n\nNowhere in this situation is unity a solution.\n\n\nSo why push it?

\" on a form in the quiet of his plush office. \n\n \n\nIndeed, Dominguez says, rates were already climbing as the peso 's\npurchasing power started sinking.\n\n\nPrime lending rates climbed to 25 percent, up from 20 percent in\nAugust 1997, and 15 percent before the shit hit the fan in July of last year.\n\n\n \n\nBut this is a misleading statistic, he says:  \" As\nyou all know, this is not the real situation, because we were already being\ncharged as high as 29 percent. &rdquo; \n\n\nSo the banks have not just been squeezing people hard, they 've been\napplying more pressure per square inch than they officially admit to doing.\n\n\n \n\nInstead of sharing the general fate of the country, the banks\nhave taken advantage of the economic crisis.\n\n\nNot only to worsen it by hoarding dollars but intensify its\nafflictions by raising interest rates on loans that haven't actually lost\nmuch real value.\n\n\nThe struggling middle-class family that took out a loan for a house\nand lot before the peso went under might continue paying dutifully the same\nloan at the same rate without any loss to the bank. \n\n \n\nBut the banks need to cover up for their mistakes, such as big\nloans extended to bank directors and special friends.\n\n\nLoans for parlous projects soured in the currency 's collapse need to\nbe covered. \n\n \n\nBut not by the big borrowers with bad loans but by the small\nborrower whose good loans must be squeezed more to compensate for the bank 's\nbig mistakes-or just to satisfy their institutional and time-honored greed.\n\n\n \n\nAt a time when salaries are worth less, people find their\nobligations to the banks doubling.\n\n\nHence, the discreetly handled defaults of big borrowers are now being\nparalleled by an increase in the roughly handled defaults of the small ones.\n\n\n \n\nTo top it off, the small depositors whose savings in banks\nprovide the capital for those big loans are earning less interest in real\nterms.\n\n\nWhile lending rates have skyrocketed, interest rates on deposits\ncontinue at 2 to 3 percent. \n\n \n\nFor the banks, it seems it is all take, take, take and never any\ngive.\n\n\nIn the present crisis, bankers continue to laugh all the way to the\nbank.\n\n\nIt is as if the banks had a God-given right always to make money and\nnever to lose any, no matter what the situation for the rest of the country.\n\n\nA time-honored principle of human relations is that those who shaft\nyou should be shafted back.\n\n\nThe banks are not afraid, for they believe in the Imeldific \"\nrule &rdquo; that those who have the gold make the rules.\n\n\nThat 's true, but those who hold the rod can change the rules.\n\n\nThe banks have money but the people have power.\n\n\nThey can tell an administration seeking vindication at the polls to\nbring the banks to heel or under state control before they ruin the country\nand hurt the people some more.\n\n\nNationalization of the banking system should start to be seriously\nconsidered. \n\n \n\nAfter all, unlike other commercial ventures that require the\nspirit of free enterprise, banking largely springs from the spirit of\nfreebooters.\n\n\nBanks don't make anything and don't sell anything.\n\n\nThey take our money and then lend it back to us.\n\n\nTheir ingenuity lies only in making more money out of our money than\nis good for the health of us all.\n\n\nIn the past, banking needed one unique quality: integrity.\n\n\nBut that 's all gone now.\n\n\nRemember that, until Imelda used it as her handbag, the country 's\nbiggest bank was a government one: the Philippine National Bank. \n\n \n\nAlready the government is showing how banking should deal with\nthe present crisis.\n\n\nIt has ordered government banks to double savings interest rates and\nto extend loans at no more than 16 percent.\n\n\nIt hopes thereby to embarrass the private banks to temper their\nrapacity. \n\n \n\nWhat for?\n\n\nJust take them over.  \n\n\n\n\n  Due credit  \n\n \n\nTrust an American to look everywhere but its oldest ally to\nshower credit for anything.\n\n\nWrote columnist William Safire last Sunday:  \" The\nJapanese call it   keiretsu   ; the Koreans say\n  chaebol   ; the Russian word is  \nsemibankirschina   ; and the Americans label the cozy\narrangement among industrialists, bankers and government officials \"\ncrony capitalism \" . &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nSafire writes that these varieties of distasteful, often illegal\nand invariably wasteful partnerships of government and businessmen \n\" are lumped together under the American phrase now in heavy vogue:\n\" crony capitalism \" . &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nAmerican phrase?\n\n\nHardly.\n\n\nIt was Filipinos who invented that term from their original,\nespecially repellent, and protracted experience of the same: an economy\nprogressively grabbed and mismanaged by friends and relatives of the thieving\ncouple Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos. \n\n \n\nIn tracing the provenance  \" of this alliterative\ngem, &rdquo;  Safire is prepared to credit every possibility but that\nit originated in the place that suffered it first, the Philippines. \n\n \n\nHe says he first came across it in a 1981 \"  Time\n \" magazine article on the Marcoses, but the writer, John\nDeMott, disclaimed  \" coinage, suggesting that it may have come\nfrom a correspondent in the field [ the Philippines] or from an insertion by\nhis editor at the time, George M. Taber. &rdquo; \n\n\nTaber didn't remember, but he ventured as how, after all, maybe he\ndid make it up from hearing the word \" \" crony &rdquo;\n\" bandied around the editorial room. \n\n \n\nWe doubt it.\n\n\nAmerican journalists are too stuck up with rules, too fastidious\nabout facts and logical connections to come up with so felicitous a phrase to\ndenote something that wasn't, strictly speaking, \" \" crony\ncapitalism. &rdquo; \" \n\n \n\nThe better term for what Marcos and his friends did to their\ncountry was \" \" state-sanctioned stealing. &rdquo; \"\n\n\nThat, too, alliterates.\n\n\nAfter all, the Marcos economy was not an unholy alliance between big\nmoney and government-as in Bismarck 's Germany, Meiji Japan and \n\" the military-industrial complex &rdquo;  of Eisenhower 's\nAmerica.\n\n\nCrony capitalism in the Philippines consisted of Marcos 's poor but\navaricious old school pals.\n\n\nThey were undistinguished by name, property or intellectual gifts,\nso he lavished our taxes on his chums so they could pretend to be\ncapitalists. \n\n \n\nParachuting American reporters from the air and Filipino\nguerilla journalists underground knew the real story of how people with no\ndistinction and money were built up from scratch into captains of industry\nwith our taxes.\n\n\nInto the national kitty they continued to dip their fingers so they\ncould go on living high on the hog while their businesses went under. \n \n\n \n\nWhere is the capitalism in a cronyism between an Ilocano\npolitician and destitute classmates like Bobby Benedicto, whom Negrenses\nscorned to invite to their table even when he was the dictator 's No. 1\nhenchman?\n\n\nOnly Filipinos-with that freedom conferred by mastery of a language\nnot their own-could have invented such a term as \" \" crony\ncapitalism &rdquo; \" for the beauty of its sound and the irony it\ncontained.\n\n\nCronies indeed, but hardly capitalists. \n\n \n\nThis term was bandied around the underground press and on all\nsocial occasions when a crony was out of earshot.\n\n\nFrom this propensity to make a joke of everything came the term that\nentered the American journalistic vocabulary years ago, but not its\nunderstanding until today. \n\n \n\nSafire cannot imagine that the term might have been picked up by\nan American reporter back here.\n\n\nFine, then.\n\n\nIt is an American invention.\n\n\nBut this failure to recognize a Filipino contribution may go deeper\nthan language.\n\n\nBecause none of those guys out there ever took seriously any\ncontribution from us natives; that 's probably how they missed the lessons\ntaught by the 20-year kleptocracy of the Marcoses. \n\n \n\nOne wonders how, after a dozen years since the ouster of Marcos,\nAmericans are only now realizing the folly of tolerating-nay, more,\nextolling-what was just the same old Marcos formula of mammoth stealing in\nThailand, Indonesia, Korea and Japan, giving it such distinguished labels as\n\" Confucian ethics \" and the \" East Asian way of\ndoing business \" . \n\n \n\nWhy only now do Americans see the folly of letting armed men\ndictate economic policy?\n\n\nWhy did they tolerate crony capitalism in other countries after\nseeing what it had done to the Philippines years before? \n\n \n\nPerhaps because Suharto and the rest of his Asian gang did the\nbidding of their Western friends in other respects.\n\n\nAfter the fall of Marcos and the restoration of democracy, the first\norder of business of the US State Department with the Aquino administration\nwas a meeting in Washington, D. C., to discuss the safety of one of the most\nnotorious, rapacious and culturally pretentious of the Marcos cronies.\n\n\nA certain Abramovitz took down notes while top State officials\ndemanded special treatment for the crook. \n\n \n\nNo wonder it is only now that Americans have discovered crony\ncapitalism and the harm it can do to a country, and, it seems, to the\nfinancial system of half the world.\n\n\nBut they are too dull to admit where they might have first learned\nabout it and gotten its name.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "71b9393c-f939-44e2-b3b7-4c4c0103b8c0", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.335726+00:00"}
{"text": "The Most Beautiful Woman in the Island  \n\n\n Cristina Pantoja-Hidalgo \n\n \n\nWhenever he could get away, the young man would go sailing or\nfishing.\n\n\nHe had never learned to swim and was actually afraid of the sea.\n\n\nBut something drew him to its icy blue depths and wayward breezes.\n\n\n \n\nThis obsession puzzled the young man 's family.\n\n\nUnable to explain it to each other, they called it a caprice, a whim,\nsomething the young man was entitled to, after all, considering how exemplary\nhe was in every other way. \n\n \n\nAlejandro - - for that was the young man 's name - - had been born\nto great privilege, and had come of age amidst prodigious expectations, all\nof which he seemed destined to fulfill.\n\n\nFor he was immensely gifted.\n\n\nIndeed, it was as if all the good fairies in the land had been in\nattendance at his birth, and had sprinkled stardust over his crib, as in that\nold tale about the sleeping princess. \n\n \n\nFrom earliest boyhood, he had shown remarkable talent for a great\nmany different things.\n\n\nOther children followed him willingly.\n\n\nGrown-ups trusted him unquestioningly.\n\n\nAnd when he began to go to school, he absorbed very quickly and very\neasily what took his classmates many long hours to learn. \n\n \n\nAs he grew into young manhood, expectations about Alejandro\nbecame even greater.\n\n\nHis mother had decided that he should be a doctor.\n\n\nShe believed Medicine to be the noblest profession, and considered\nher son admirably suited for it.\n\n\nThus, Alejandro was dutifully doing a difficult pre-medical course,\nand would, in time, be admitted into his university 's prestigious medical\ncollege. \n\n \n\nHis father had decided that Alejandro should also eventually take\nover the family 's financial empire.\n\n\nHe had discovered that his son seemed able to turn whatever he\ntouched to gold, like the king in that other old tale.\n\n\nThus, Alejandro obligingly spent his summers in his father 's\noffices, serving time as apprentice king. \n\n \n\nHis fianc\u00e9e, Inez - - a maiden as beautiful, well-born and\nwell-bred as Alejandro himself - - wanted Alejandro to devote himself to art.\n\n\nFor Alejandro wrote poetry, painted watercolor landscapes, played the\npiano and the guitar, even sang lead for a rock band.\n\n\nAnd she fancied herself in the role of muse to his creative genius.\n\n\n \n\nHis uncle, the bishop, believed that Alejandro should use his\ntremendous gifts in helping the unfortunate, for only with a life of totally\nselfless dedication could he possibly repay the good Lord for the\nmultifarious blessings bestowed upon him. \n\n \n\nHis friends - - including his best friend, Eric - - were\nconvinced that Alejandro should become a statesman, and solve the enormous\nproblems besieging his little country, for if Alejandro could not do it, who\ncould? \n\n \n\nFor the first twenty years of his life, Alejandro had been\nimpervious to these contradictory demands.\n\n\nThough aware of them, he had not taken them seriously.\n\n\nOne man obviously could not be everything that everyone wanted him to\nbe.\n\n\nIn the meantime, he was simply enjoying life. \n\n \n\nBut after his twentieth birthday, a change took place in\nAlejandro.\n\n\nHe grew restless and troubled.\n\n\nUnaccustomed to any form of disquiet, he could not understand it.\n\n\nNor did he know how to cope with it.\n\n\nWhat had formerly given him pleasure now seemed to cause him only\npain.\n\n\nLike his sports car, and his charge accounts, and his outstanding\nschool record, and the attentions which the ladies continued to favor him\nwith.\n\n\nHe began to avoid the country clubs and the hotel discos where his\nfriends spent their weekends.\n\n\nHe resigned from his band.\n\n\nSoon his social life was limited to the student organizations he\nbelonged to.\n\n\nBut even these no longer gave him any satisfaction. \n\n \n\nHis family, his friends, his fianc\u00e9e were bewildered.\n\n\nHad one fairy been forgotten?\n\n\nWas happiness, perhaps, the gift withheld? \n\n \n\nHis father, at a loss for something that would amuse the son and\nheir, or at least distract him from his demons, presented Alejandro with a\nboat.\n\n\nThe good man had forgotten that Alejandro did not know how to swim.\n\n\n \n\nAlejandro himself had never figured out why he could not swim.\n\n\nWas there a childhood trauma?\n\n\nA genetic disability?\n\n\nThis flaw in him gave him curious satisfaction.\n\n\nHe did not bother to scrutinize this.\n\n\nNor did he question the dangerous lure of the sea. \n\n \n\nHe had named his sleek white boat \" Tania \" ,\npartly because of the Danish baroness who had a farm in Africa and wrote the\nmost beautiful stories he had ever read; but mostly because he knew no woman\ncalled Tania. \n\n \n\nThe sea Alejandro sailed in was usually a mild one.\n\n\nStretched out, shirtless and hatless, on the Tania 's deck, his\ncigarettes and a bottle of chilled beer within easy reach, he would often\ndrift off to sleep, lulled by the gentle lapping of the waves, carried by it\nto the edges of a dream, which, however, always eluded him.\n\n\nHe felt no impatience over this, he who had grown impatient over so\nmany things.\n\n\nSomehow, he knew that one day, the sea would allow him to enter the\ndream.\n\n\nAnd then he would understand. \n\n \n\nHe would understand what he had only now begun to discover.\n\n\nHe would understand why he was different, so different from everyone\nelse he knew, that it seemed he was always alone.\n\n\nAnd why, though he had been given so many gifts, none of them brought\nhim joy. \n\n \n\nThis went on for two years. \n\n \n\nOne day in April, while Alejandro was at the wheel of the\n\" Tania \" , it struck him that the sea had grown so calm\nthat the boat seemed to be drifting just above the water.\n\n\nThe air was cooler and permeated with a fragrance he could not name.\n\n\nThe light had altered, and it seemed to Alejandro that everything\naround him - - including the boat itself - - had become translucent. \n\n \n\nThen he saw the island.\n\n\nIt loomed suddenly before him, already so close that it might have\nemerged from the sea before his eyes.\n\n\nAstonished, Alejandro reached for his map, certain that he had never\nseen this island before, though he had sailed in this part of the sea often\nenough.\n\n\nWhen he could not find it on his map, he concluded that he had\nstrayed off course, and was now in unexplored territory. \n\n \n\nEric, who had been asleep in the cabin, and had been roused when\nAlejandro had dropped anchor and switched off the boat 's engine, came up on\ndeck. \n\n \n\nAlejandro spoke without thinking, and in speaking, discovered his\nown intentions.\n\n\n \" I have to spend a little time here, Eric, &rdquo;\n he said.\n\n\n \" You take the \" Tania \" home and come\nback for me in thirty days, all right? &rdquo; \n\n \n\nAnd, after some demurring, Eric acquiesced, having always done as\nAlejandro wished. \n\n \n\nIt was a wide beach, with sand as fine as sugar, sloping up to\nwhere a fringe of trees came down to meet it.\n\n\nAlejandro began to climb, following urgency he could not recall ever\nfeeling in his life.\n\n\nAs he climbed, he realized that the island was a mountain, thickly\nwooded with trees so tall that the distant canopy of their arched branches\nseemed like a second sky. \n\n \n\nPresently, he came to a pebbled path, which wound its way between\nlow shrubs and patches of wildflowers.\n\n\nAlejandro decided to follow it. \n\n \n\nAfter he had climbed a long time, he noticed that the trail had\nwidened into an ordinary country road, and that it had grown less steep.\n\n\nBut the breeze rustling through the trees was colder and stronger.\n\n\n \n\nSuddenly the road levelled off, and Alejandro found himself\nstanding in a small clearing and looking down on a town, nestling among soft\ngreen hills.\n\n\nIn the gauze-like mist, shapes and colors looked nebulous, seemed to\nwaver, dissolve, and re-emerge.\n\n\nAlejandro made out brick cottages with slanted grey roofs, little\nlemon-colored shops, a white church perched on a hill, a lake ringed by\nweeping willows, and everywhere, crowded into beds, climbing up posts,\nspilling from balconies, rainbow-hued flowers. \n\n \n\nHe followed the road down to where it became the town 's neatly\npaved main street.\n\n\nIt took him past some small shops, and brought him to a little brown\ninn around the comer from a park. \n\n \n\nInside the inn 's dim lobby, a spidery-looking gentleman sitting\nbehind a wooden counter peered incuriously at Alejandro over thick\nspectacles, and indicated the place in his ledger where Alejandro was to sign\nhis name. \n\n \n\nThen, Alejandro walked back to the main street, and bought\nhimself a few clothes, some writing paper, a ball pen, a toothbrush, and a\nfresh pack of cigarettes.\n\n\nHe passed a music store on his way back to the inn, and, as an\nafterthought, decided to buy a guitar. \n\n \n\nThe next few days Alejandro spent wandering around the hills that\nsurrounded the little town, tracing footpaths where they led him, stopping by\nmeandering streams, eating simple meals in whichever roadside food stand he\nfound himself close to when it would occur to him that he was hungry.\n\n\nHe rose at dawn, when the town was still wrapped in an opalescent\nhaze, and returned to his room shortly after nightfall, tired but tranquil,\nto sleep deeply and dreamlessly until the next day.\n\n\nHe never thought of his home or his parents, or of his\nfianc\u00e9e, Inez, or of his best friend, Eric. \n\n \n\nHe could not have said what he was looking for or waiting for.\n\n\nDuring his long walks under the ancient trees, he did not even think\nof anything in particular.\n\n\nMostly, he smoked and watched the dragonflies and the butterflies\ndarting among the flowers in the dappled sunlight.\n\n\nBut he knew, with more certainty than he had ever felt before, that\nhe was where he had to be. \n\n \n\nOne morning, having risen earlier than usual, and discovered a\nnarrow road leading away from the more travelled one and up a low hill,\nAlejandro found himself in front of a tall, intricately embellished iron\ngate.\n\n\nA drive curved away from it and lost itself in a tangle of vines and\ntrees.\n\n\nAlejandro gripped the gate 's bars, sensing the change in him, the\nbreath quickening, a pulse beating...\n\n\nBut the gate was locked. \n\n \n\nThat evening, he questioned the innkeeper about the tall gate at\nthe end of the narrow road. \n\n \n\n \" Oh yes, &rdquo;  the innkeeper said,\n \" it 's the old house.\n\n\nIt has been there a long time.\n\n\nNo one remembers who built it though. &rdquo; \n\n\nAlejandro asked whether anyone lived in it now. \n\n \n\n \" Yes,\"  the innkeeper said, \n\" Mrs. Monteverde. &rdquo; \n\n\nBut he did not know much about her.\n\n\nShe did not come into town at all, except for evening mass now and\nthen.\n\n\nSome said she was ill.\n\n\nOthers said she was simply strange.\n\n\nShe had a maid and a driver, an old Chinese couple who came to town\nto do the marketing, a taciturn sort, not given to gossiping with the\ntownspeople.\n\n\nHe could not recall when she had moved in - - a year ago, maybe two.\n\n\nNor did he know where she had come from.\n\n\nNo one really knew. \n\n \n\nThe next day, and the day after, Alejandro returned to the tall\ngate at the end of the narrow road, as irresistibly drawn to it as he had\nbeen drawn to the sea.\n\n\nBoth times he found it locked. \n\n \n\nOne afternoon, as he trudged up the narrow road, his hands deep\nin the pockets of his new jacket, he saw a butterfly poised above a low bush.\n\n\nIts delicate wings were the color of lilacs sprinkled with gold\ndust, and in the sunlight, they looked iridescent.\n\n\nThe lovely creature hovered before him, seemed about to perch on his\nleft shoulder, then it fluttered away.\n\n\nAlejandro knew that the old gate would finally be open.\n\n\nAnd it was. \n\n \n\nThe drive led him through a garden which had been allowed to\ngrow wild, a garden much shaded and shadowed by enormous ferns, and vines\nwith cascading blossoms like amethysts and garnets, and immensely tall trees\naround whose trunks were twined plants sprouting strange blooms with long\npistils and velvety, topaz-streaked petals. \n\n \n\nAnd, almost hidden from view, stood the house - - a\nthree-storied mansion of a design Alejandro did not recognize, knowing only\nthat it looked very old and stately and serene, with its colonnades and\ngables, its arched doorways and bay windows and overhanging balconies.\n\n\nHe imagined that behind the shuttered windows, there would be dim,\nlofty rooms, old silk and damask faded portraits in ornate frames.\n\n\nAnd the lady of the house would descend a sweeping staircase under a\ndripping crystal chandelier, wearing lace and pearls. \n\n \n\nMeanwhile, he was circling the house, listening to his own\nfootsteps on many layers of dried leaves, and gazing, bemused, at a little\nstone angel drooping forlornly over a broken fountain... at a frail wooden\nbridge arching over what may have been a stream, long since gone dry, and\nleading inexplicably into an overgrown hedge... \n\n \n\nAnd suddenly, there she was - - the lady of the house!\n\n\nFor it could only be she, he thought.\n\n\nMrs. Monteverde.\n\n\nThis woman could not possibly be the maid. \n\n \n\nBut she wore no lace or pearls.\n\n\nShe was dressed in a loose, white, long-sleeved cotton blouse, grey\nslacks, dark glasses and a large-brimmed straw hat.\n\n\nShe had been bending over some potted plants, and now came towards\nhim, one hand holding a trowel, apparently as unperturbed as the innkeeper by\nAlejandro 's unannounced appearance in her garden. \n\n \n\nShe stood there - - outlined against the ruddy glow of the\nsetting sun - - waiting quietly as he stammered through his apology, the\nexplanation which, he realized, was barely coherent.\n\n\nAnd when he had finished, she said softly,  \" Never\nmind.\n\n\nYou will have tea with me. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nShe led the way to a terrace behind the house.\n\n\nThough he had not yet recovered from the audacity of his own\nintrusion, it struck Alejandro that she moved with the languid, fluid grace\nof the sea gulls which sometimes flew over his boat as he fished.\n\n\nAnd as he followed her, he caught the scent of jasmines. \n\n \n\nThe air here seemed to capture and hold fragrance.\n\n\nAnd there was about the place the same strange translucence that had\nstruck him at sea, just before he saw the island. \n\n \n\nAlejandro realized that here, wildness had given way to order\nand grace and harmony.\n\n\nFlowers had been coaxed into beds, trimmed into hedges, banked\naround trees.\n\n\nBushes were pruned.\n\n\nPaths were laid.\n\n\nSomeone with an eye for the rightness of things had arranged colors\nand lines and textures into the happiest combinations.\n\n\nBut why, he wondered, had so much care been lavished on the back\nyard, and so much neglect inflicted on the front garden? \n\n \n\nThey sat on old carved chairs, facing each other across a small\nmarble-topped table, and she served him tea with a trace of lemon and\nfragrant spices, in small handless porcelain cups the color of old ivory.\n\n\n \n\nShe had taken off her hat, and he saw that her hair was long and\nstraight and very dark, tied back from her face with a slender strip of black\nvelvet.\n\n\nAnd, as he took the first sip of his tea, she removed her dark\nglasses, and he found himself looking into her eyes, which were as cool and\nclear as the morning when he had first walked up the narrow road and\ndiscovered her gate. \n\n \n\nLater, Alejandro could not recall what they had said to each\nother.\n\n\nHe had the vague feeling that he must have done most of the talking,\nwhile the lady listened, sitting very still, with one elbow resting on the\narm of her chair, and a smile lurking in the corners of her mouth.\n\n\nHe had asked her if he might return, but he knew beforehand what her\nanswer would be. \n\n \n\nSo Alejandro 's life in the island acquired a new pattern.\n\n\nEvery day, wherever his perambulations took him, he always presented\nhimself at Maria Monteverde 's garden at the hour before sunset, when she\nwould have finished tending her plants and would be ready for tea. \n\n \n\nSometimes they took it in the terrace, as on that first\nafternoon.\n\n\nAnd sometimes under a large mango tree in the garden, from whose\nbranches hung a woven hammock, in which she liked to half sit and half lie,\nwhile he leaned against the tree 's trunk, smoking, or stretched out on the\ngrass, transferring his gaze from the incandescent sky to her face and back\nto the sky again.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "14db1630-3724-4c45-9f05-f42008a532e1", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.337228+00:00"}

Go \n\n \n\nOn that Friday, eve of the October  Caracol  , the\npeople of Salinas came in dusty throngs and crowded the church of the\n Virgen del Santo Rosario  to see if what they had heard\nwas true.\n\n\nBeneath festive buntings of plastic straws fashioned into stars,\nexcited children, tanned from frolicking in the sea, arrived mostly ahead of\nthe others. \n\n \n\n Hurry!  they cried to each other. \n\n \n\nThose who had been cooking since the early morning hours missed\nit, so now they were wrenched from their huge iron pots, called \nkawang  , set up in backyards. \n\n \n\n Is it true?  they cried over fences and dogs, even\nlouder than the infernal roar of countless tricycles that plied the narrow\nroads down to the  Aplaya  , ferrying the curious who poured\nin from Sapa, Wawa, Ligtong and the other  barrios  along\nthe shorelines.\n\n\nAll were wooed by the promise of a phenomenon. \n\n \n\n A miracle!\n\n\nHurry!  \n\n \n\nFreshly laundered curtains were left half-hung, and clotheslines\nshuddered from frantic tugs of those whose fiesta best had to be secured\nbefore scampering off to the church, leaving an occasional cat yawning on the\nsill.\n\n\nEven the fish brokers at the cove  pandawan  paused\nmomentarily from whispered bids, their pencils clenched in the same greedy\nhands as the little slips of paper with hastily written numbers, while fish\njust unloaded from the boats looked all the more forsaken in their piles.\n\n\n \n\n They cannot move her!  people announced from the\nstreet corners.\n\n\n She refuses to be lifted!  \n\n \n\nA multitude of hands crossed forehead to chest, left to right.\n\n\n God, merciful Father!  they said to one another.\n\n\n How could this happen?\n\n\nForgiveness, Lord!  some pleaded. \n\n \n\nAt the church, the parish priest ordered the lights on so that no\none would be trampled in the scramble to see the life-sized Virgin that\ncrowned the old  retable  .\n\n\nPeople nudged on, jostling others, as they elbowed their way through\nthe aisles to be nearer their patron.\n\n\nMany crammed the pews and absently joined the prayer of the beads,\nthat exercise so quickly organized by scapulared women in white trying but\nfailing to look more pious and more distressed than the rest.\n\n\nAll eight heavily carved Baroque doors were thrown open to allow a\nchange of air and freshen the church of its odors--an oppressing mixture of\nhuman sweat and mucus, animal excrement and frying oil. \n\n \n\nThe good father shook his head and strained to keep his holy\ntemper.\n\n\nHe had already chided himself twice because he wanted to hit the\nmayor for inviting the press who were just then entering the churchyard.\n\n\nThey had come, of course, to record the spectacle of the Virgin who\nall of a sudden had become so incredibly heavy that the usual dozen\nable-bodied men could not push, or much less lift, her onto the Platform that\nwas to take her in procession around the town on the morrow, for the \nCaracol  . \n\n \n\nI was ten in 1963 when, from Manila where I lived, I spent the\nsummer in my mother 's hometown,  Barrio  Sapa just\noutside Salinas in Cavite.\n\n\nI stayed with her younger sister Vinying who was married to a much\nolder, rather stern looking man I called  Coya  Mario. \n\n \n\n Ate  Vinying was cheerful and attentive, always\nfussing over me as she did household details.\n\n\nShe and  Coya  had no children of their own even after\nsix years of marriage.\n\n\nSoon after I arrived, one afternoon I heard  Ate \nVinying calling out to her husband from the kitchen.\n\n\n Coya  was out in the wide backyard where they dried\nfish and stored large clay jars to make  patis  , or fish\nsauce.\n\n\nHe was drinking with a group of friends who were fishermen like him.\n\n\n \n\n  Hoy  Mario!\n\n\nYour  butete  is overdone!\n\n\nYou better come right now!  \n\n \n\nI hurried into the kitchen to see.\n\n\nAll morning long,  Coya  had been boasting of his\nspecialty--boiled puffer fish--which is notorious for being poisonous, but\nsaid to be one of the most delicious fish in the sea. \n\n \n\n There are few men in the world who can cook this edibly,\nMameng!\n\n\nYou are a lucky child because your uncle is one of them. \n\n\n \n\n So how do you do it,  Coya  ?  I\nasked. \n\n \n\n Secret,  hija  , that 's a secret!\n\n\nIt dies with me--I 'll die first! \n\n\nHe laughed heartily. \n\n \n\nThe aroma of red ginger and lemon grass, simmering in coconut\nmilk with curry, filled the dimly lit kitchen.\n\n\nPeeking through the tiny doorway I watched  Coya \nremove the clay pot from the fire.\n\n\nHe lifted its cover and sniffed, then he crooned for Ming, the\ngreyish green cat he adopted when it strayed into the yard as a kitten. \n\n \n\n Coya  pinched a small puffer from the pot and\ntossed it to Ming which, after a nibble, carried the fish to its favorite\ncorner.\n\n\nAs it ate,  Coya  watched with a smile that spread\nfrom the corners of his moustache to the dark, rough wrinkles beneath his\neyes, while his prematurely bald head glistened from the glow of the embers\non the hearth.\n\n\nAt that moment, he noticed me and winked. \n\n \n\n Cats have many lives to spare for men,  he said.\n\n\n So, come and taste your uncle 's specialty,  he\noffered, as I frowned.\n\n\nAfter another look at his cat, he turned to bring the pot to his\nwaiting friends who applauded in approval. \n\n \n\n Here we are, my fearless friends!\n\n\nOnly for the real men in Sapa!  \n\n \n\nThe cat soon consumed its treat and was licking its paws when the\ndrunken banter centered on the Abad family and how it was dying out without\nany sons. \n\n \n\n From eating puffers!  someone roared.\n\n\n Then losing all his hair!  another added.\n\n\n Mario, you might have been kinder to marry one of the\nmermaids! \n\n\nLaughter. \n\n \n\nIn a more serious tone, someone said,   Oy \n,  pareng  Mario.\n\n\nThis is just to tell you, like a brother might, that you really have\nto dance now,  pare  .\n\n\nDance!\n\n\nUnless you take your father 's place, I swear, you will never have a\nchild!\n\n\nNever!  \n\n \n\nA few agreed although I heard  Coya  grunt his\ndisapproval.\n\n\nQuietly I slipped out the back door of the kitchen to sit near the\nclay jars from where I saw  Coya  filling his glass with rhum.\n\n\n \n\n It 's true, Mario.\n\n\nLet me tell you, you 're almost like my son, one of my dearest\nfriends as well.\n\n\nNo more Abad after you. \n\n\nCoya said nothing, avoiding looking into anyone 's eyes. \n\n \n\n  Oy  !\n\n\nAre you listening?  the man nearest him nudged on.\n\n\n Oy!\n\n\nDance, will you?\n\n\nDon't you like to wear the colors, like a butterfly\n\n\nAnd to be the  Alay  , that--that is the honor!\n \n\n \n\n Coya  Mario slammed his glass on the table, his\nface reddening.\n\n\nBefore he could reply, however, his father  Kaka \nTesong boomed from behind,  Vinying!\n\n\n Oy  , Vinying!  \n\n \n\nThe older Abad hobbled over as if he had trouble walking and\nbending his legs, for he spent a lot of time sitting down.\n\n\nThe men seemed to cower in their seats as  Kaka \nTesong again called loudly,  Vinying!  \n\n \n\n  Po  ! \n\n\n Ate  Vinying answered from somewhere within the tiny\ntwo-room house.\n\n\nShe remained inside, however. \n\n \n\n You know, Vinying?  the old man began, his deeply\nlined face frowning as he studied  Coya  Mario with\ndisappointment.\n\n\n I am one unfortunate man.  \n\n \n\n Kaka  Tesong 's gaze locked onto his son 's.\n\n\nThen the older Abad 's face turned almost kind, though his loud voice\nstill cracked like an old church bell tolling at a funeral. \n\n \n\n This Mario, my only child Mario.\n\n\nYou know I must tell you,  this time addressing  Coya\n 's friends.\n\n\n He 's too good for this business of dancing for the Virgin.\n\n\nSo tough, too much of a man for such delicacies.\n\n\nHe thinks it has to be one 's will, his decision.\n\n\nIt 's sad that he has forgotten.\n\n\nIf not for my vow to be the Virgin 's fool, do you think he would be\nhere among you, to cook for you this fish you are so mad about?\n\n\nWhat?\n\n\nTell me, speak!\n\n\nYou are men who serve the Virgin too, speak!  \n\n \n\nThe group, now sober, replied with soft embarrassed laughter.\n\n\nAll except  Coya  , who poked at the dish of puffers\nbefore him.\n\n\nHe emptied his glass, pretending not to care, but his eyes shifted\nfrom one of his friends to the other, warning them not to reply.\n\n\n Coya  gave a bit of fish to the cat, which had\nhopped onto the bench beside him. \n\n \n\n Kaka  Tesong suddenly picked up Ming and turned\nto leave.\n\n\nAddressing it this time, he said,  So!\n\n\nAnother one who wants so much for nothing, huh?  \n\n \n\nTurning sharply,  Coya  was about to say\nsomething when one of his friends restrained him with a finger to his lips.\n\n\nEveryone watched  Kaka  Tesong 's movements as he\nmade his way back to his own small house across the yard where he mended\nfishing nets for a living.\n\n\nSoon the old man was stoking embers under huge vats.\n\n\nThose contained nets that boiled in pig 's blood to strengthen them.\n\n\n \n\nBeyond hearing,  Coya  Mario muttered, \nDid you think you could compromise me, too?\n\n\nDance in the street like some idiot, painted like a woman!\n\n\nYou know there 's only one dance I know.  \n\n \n\n And what 's that,  pare  ?  his\nfriends chorused. \n\n \n\n Oy, Vinying, come out here!\n\n\nLet 's show these bastards what we dance every night!  he\ncalled out. \n\n \n\nThe men roared with laughter, the merriment returning. \n\n \n\n So!\n\n\nNo wonder he doesn't have children, all he does is dance! \n\n\n \n\nSoon the jokes began to sound sleazy and  Ate \nVinying, who had started to sweep the yard, quickly sent me to the \nAplaya  to gather small brown clams burrowing in shallow water. \n\n \n\n Mameng, fill this dish and we 'll have  halaan\n for dinner.\n\n\nHurry back, child, it won't be long before the men will leave.\n\n\nIt 'll be dark soon, you hear?  \n\n \n\nAs she spoke, I was halfway out of the yard, scampering\nexcitedly down the small backways and other yards leading to the seashore.\n\n\nI dashed across the shore to disturb hundreds of tiny ghost crabs,\ntheir dotted, fragile bodies the color of the sand.\n\n\nThis way, then the other, they moved with me, crawling at one pace\nall together so that the sand seemed to have come alive, rippling in this,\nthen the other direction. \n\n \n\nEach time I stopped to shove my feet about the sand in search of\na clam, the ghost crabs darted from me into their holes which dotted the\nshoreline.\n\n\nThere were always more now, then less later, then more again, the\nelusive little creatures evading me.\n\n\nI set down the dish of clams to chase them and poke a stick into a\nfew holes to draw some out, hoping to make them continue their eerie waltz.\n\n\nThen I caught one but crushed it in a fistful of sand although it\nseemed to disappear entirely in my hand, lost forever in the grains. \n\n \n\nSuddenly I heard the voices of men singing and the heavy\nthumping of feet breaking into a run.\n\n\nI looked up to see  Coya  Mario and his friends just\narriving at the  Aplaya  , striding quickly like bronzed gods\nin single file, coils of nets strung on their shoulders from the first man to\nthe last, with Ming trailing them.\n\n\nThey were singing a Tagalog folk song:   Paru-parong bukid\nNa lilipad-lipad Sa gitna ng parang Papaga-pagaspas!   \n\n \n\nAmidst the hoots and catcalls of wives and lovers cheering from\nthe upper shore, the men alternately skipped and danced to their melody now\ntaken up by the women until the very last lines:   At saka lumakad\nNang pakendeng-kendeng!   and the fishermen were upon their boats\nas they roared louder than the waves that crashed about them with the\nincoming tide.\n\n\nSoon they waved to all when they boarded shirtless in the early\nsummer evening. \n\n \n\nI waved back fascinated, as they heaved the nets onto the three\nboats, with the mermaids painted on the bows, identical except for the color\nof their hair.\n\n\n Coya  raised an arm to say goodbye while he cradled\nMing in the other.\n\n\nSoon they set off on their motorized  bancas \ntill they disappeared in the soft dark blue sunset, at about the time \nAte  Vinying came looking for me, a coconut stem broom in her hand.\n\n\n \n\nAlthough I was Carmen in Manila, everyone called me Mameng in\nSapa.\n\n\n Mameng, the daughter of Floring, who married that\nManile&ntilde;o, Floring, sister of Virginia. \n\n\n Yes, she 's the niece of Vinying, that beautiful but\nchildless woman who 's married to Mario the bald. \n\n\n Oh, you mean Mario, the son of Tereso Abad, the town \nAlay  ? \n\n\n That 's the one. \n\n\n Oh, she 's the grandchild of the  Alay  then!\n \n\n \n\nTo be related to the  Alay  was a blessing, and\nafter a while, I was Mameng the grandchild of the  Alay  .\n\n\nThen I would have to listen to how his sacrifices to the Virgin\nassured them all of good fortune all year round, safe from pestilence,\nravages of weather or turns in destiny.\n\n\nThen they would ask,  have you ever seen his shirt? \n\n\nThen they would tell me how colorful it was and how they had\ncontributed to it, before I would be allowed to leave and play. \n\n \n\nThere were old  manzanita  trees planted\nbetween  Coya  Mario 's and  Kaka  Tesong 's\nhouses.\n\n\nI often climbed those trees, which didn't grow very tall, for their\nsmall green apple-shaped fruits.\n\n\nFrom there I watched the old man working at the vats in the yard\nbelow while I threw unripe fruits at Ming, sleeping among the nets.\n\n\nMy playmates were older, distant cousins,  Ate  Luvy\nand  Ate  Cora. \n\n \n\nThere were times we blew soap bubbles made even more slippery\nwith leaves shredded from the hibiscus shrubs that lined many of the fences\nin Sapa.\n\n\nOver  Kaka  Tesong 's vats sailed our glistening\nbubbles, spotted with bits of green.\n\n\nWhen we had a stretch of morning we wound up each other 's hair with\nthe soft stems also of the hibiscus until we looked like we had grown\ntendrils on our heads.\n\n\nThen later in the afternoon we ran down to the  Wawa \nwhere the river joined the sea, hurrying to catch the low tide so that the\nnarrow concrete walkway leading to the other side of the small channel would\nstill be above the water. \n\n \n\nThen we whiled away the rest of the day watching the fishing\ncrews come in to offer their catch to the best bidders at the \npandawan  .\n\n\nWe became such familiar visitors there that the fishing folk missed\nus when we didn't come and told us the next time around,   Oyo\n , kin of the  Alay  !\n\n\nWhere were you yesterday?\n\n\nYou see, we had no luck with the fish! \n\n\nOr,  We were certain you would come!\n\n\nThe fish were jumping into our boats so they could be here with you!\n \n\n \n\nOften we were prized with a choice portion of the haul,\nsometimes a rare  papacol  , from  Coya  's\nfriends who would not let him go without chiding him,  That Mario!\n\n\nHe never brings us such luck as these young ladies!\n\n\nAll he brings us is that cat, which preys on the fish!  \n\n \n\nAnd just when the tide turned completely to submerge the\nwalkway, we waded back in thigh-deep water that soaked our faded cotton\ndresses.\n\n\nWe trailed the fishermen as they brought home their earnings and\nshare of the catch.\n\n\nOnce, I was hoisted upon a young man 's shoulder to keep me dry, and\nwith my day-long curls caught in the breeze, I posed just like one of the\nmermaids astride the bows of their boats.\n\n\nSomeone remarked that the  Santo Rosario  was\nparading too early with no one dancing in her path, at which the other men\npromptly began to sway from side to side, and playfully sang their butterfly\ntune, while I tried my best to keep from falling.\n\n\nGlancing at my uncle, I saw  Coya  Mario had slung\nthe bunch of arrowfish he had been carrying on his belt and followed us,\nstaring ahead grimly.\n\n\nHe stroked Ming on his arm, in the same manner that someone stroked\na long-time pain.\n\n\nDancing seemed to be farthest from his mind.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "894ec577-4c3c-4743-8472-e6df7b92483c", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.338845+00:00"}
{"text": "MUD: A Memory  \n\n\n  Part I  \n\n \n\n From the stone watchtower on a strip of barren coastal land\nnear Santander, Arcadio had a view of two islands forever reaching out to\neach other - a vista that roused in him a longing to touch all the broken\nshards of the Philippine archipelago and all the nameless people with whom he\nshared a common culture and history.  \n\n\n By RENATO E. MADRID \n\n \n\n The  year Arcadio was born had been marked by\nseveral personal disasters on the part of his father.\n\n\nIt was the worst single year of Capitan Delfin 's already long\nexistence, but that was according to his own estimate.\n\n\nAnd since people only tend to lie about their good fortunes but\nreadily go into the minutest details about the worst things that could\nhappen, he may have been right. \n\n \n\nThe crops failed that year, mainly through infestations of various\nkinds which ignored all human ingenuity and denied the usefulness of previous\nexperience.\n\n\nFarmers recommended to each other the torching of entire fields,\noffering that service to those who lacked the same ruthlessness to put their\nown children to the sword if these should ever be guilty of choosing death\nover dishonor.\n\n\nFrom eating remnants of the infestation mixed in with their ordinary\nfeed - a loss-cutting measure on the part of some livestock-raisers - the\nfirst hundred head of cattle died.\n\n\nThe unintentional poison feeding was at first denied, then owned up\nto in the interests of the common good, before it was completely and\nresolutely discontinued.\n\n\nAnd so there was a total absence of an explanation for the deaths\nthat still continued to take place. \n\n \n\nNor did the animal husbandry detectives dispatched to Valladolid\nby the Bureau find a trace of the culprit among the veritable salad of\nf1uids, tissue samples and wastes they had extracted with flamboyant and\nsuperior air, or merely picked off the soiled grass in their desperation\nlater.\n\n\nThrough a good part of that awful year, encountering a number of dead\nanimals became almost the natural expectation of a casual walk through the\nrural landscape, even in the remotest pastures of the village.\n\n\nOne learned to look past them at other points of interest or simply\nhurried away, and understandably developed a sudden preference for fish\nespecially in the restaurants.\n\n\nThere seemed to be nothing anyone could do for the poor animals and\nin their present or future condition they could only be useful in an oblique\nway: it became a propitious time to impress on youngsters ( to whom the\ndeaths were more diverting than distressing) something about the\nprecariousness of life and the importance of good eating habits. \n\n \n\nBut many a parent who started out with such intentions soon\nlearned to be inventive about answering questions on God 's deep and lasting\nhatred for farm animals, and what practical uses the devil might have for a\npair of horns.\n\n\n( One of the first sights of the infant Arcadio from the kitchen\nwindow, while being carried in his nurse 's arms, was of stiff-legged\ncreatures floating down the river, toylike in the simplicity of death,\napparently weightless, and idly turning in the placid waters as they flowed\npast his father 's torched fields toward the delta and the sea.\n\n\nBut it was something of which, in later life, he would have\nabsolutely no recollection whatsoever.) \n\n \n\nDelfin was not the village  Capitan  yet, not\nfor a long while, and so he had time to waste on some of the fine things in\nlife - - some of them less useful than farm animals dead or alive, but\nnotches higher.\n\n\nHe loved poetry for the way it lifted the clouds of sameness and\nordinariness that seemed permanently fixed above a man 's life on the farm,\nbut it was not the poetry you found in a book nor the kind you listen to\npatiently until you begin to doubt your own hearing or your knowledge of the\nwords.\n\n\nThis, too, would bring him added misfortune, but in his self-deluded\nway he would look at the inconvenience as hostility aimed at poetry rather\nthan at himself, or more simply still as another way for him to recall with\nincreased sense of gratitude ( if that were possible) the year his son was\nborn. \n\n \n\nThen the deaths stopped altogether; stopped with noticeable\nabruptness, as if they had been day-laborers looking out for a man with a\nstopwatch and whistle rather than an hourglass and a scythe.\n\n\nEven beasts thought to be on their last legs were observed, at a\ncertain hour on a certain day, suddenly raising themselves up on all fours,\nand beginning to manifest once again every sign of good health in addition to\nan alarming appetite.\n\n\nIt was tempting to surmise that the stupid beasts had been\nplay-acting all along, some even carrying the pretense far beyond the limits\nof mortality.\n\n\nBut most of the villagers, except for those few who normally chose\nthe colorful over the logical, preferred to attribute the end of the animal\nplague to a miracle that the sincerity of their faith had caused to happen -\n- faith, and a chain of Masses being offered at the small village church by a\nvisiting priest, the first in Valladolid 's memory to ever hold ( with or\nwithout the promised results) a Votive liturgy to address their needs but in\nan earthy, custom-made, no-nonsense way that they found so consoling. \n\n \n\nThe much-reiterated  Mass for the Speedy Conclusion of a\nPestilence  , combining the stark simplicity of its essentials with\nsevere unaccompanied chant and an almost businesslike Intention, was clearly\na battering-ram of a prayer with which to storm heaven and bend ( without\ngrating) the Divine Ear.\n\n\nIn retrospect its directly intended result of  \" God 's\ngreater power demonstrated by the lifting of an evil and undeserved curse\"\n  ( Unrevised Text)  was a far better explanation for those\nstrange animal happenings than the other existing explanation ( still making\nthe rounds) which was emotionally disturbing in addition to carrying pagan\novertones. \n\n \n\n The  only place to catch a flavor of that\nexplanation was in the conversations of elderly Valladolid folk, who were the\nonly ones possessed of a faith that allowed them to be moved by mountains,\nforests, streams and the like, at the same time that they were actually\nenthralled by the comparatively recent story of a loving God who allowed\nHimself to be nailed to a cross.\n\n\nThe elderly were the greater number of the adults in Valladolid and\nhad carried the burdens of its multitudinous farms under generations of\nlandlords varying from sullen friars who corrected remnant heathen practices\nwith a beating from their dangling rosaries to listless, younger sons who\nnever minded if the peasants grew little more than grass under their feet so\nlong as their daughters were clean.\n\n\nThere were none among these long-suffering veterans but had families\nto keep them well-clothed and fed. \n\n \n\nBut the soil was to them as the air we breathe, thus it was not\nrare to find them with their fingers rooting in the soil until last minute of\nthe day before they died, or else crowded like a convocation of mutes at an\neatery table, embalming themselves beforehand with potent betel juices and\nyoung vinegar ( surely not for the young), with no talk except of soil on\ntheir lips, and soil in their hearts and in their brains. \n\n \n\nAccording to their explanation, the village 's plant and animal\ntroubles could only have occurred when they did; for wasn't that year a major\nanniversary for the great mudslide?\n\n\nWhich particular anniversary it was, the old villagers refused to be\nprecise about the matter, but this refusal was by no means due to deadened\nfaculties.\n\n\nTheir farmer 's intuition was well acquainted with the peculiar way\nNature was given to initiating or protracting certain spells that clearly\nserved none but her own ends.\n\n\nFrom long and careful experience the old farmers grew to recognize\nthem as spells of simple recall and self-congratulation on Nature 's part.\n\n\n \n\nBut for this insight to be useful to their understanding of that\ntight-lipped and easily irked task-mistress ( the wielding of a tremendous\nand unfathomable power had got them past the gender problem with no trouble\nat all) they had to go back farther to the quality of sounds they had only\nhad the opportunity to hear in deserted and cavernous places where the\nquality of sacredness was such as to silence the impertinence of toads and\nquell arrogance from its roots, in the heart.\n\n\nOnly there did the structure of sound yield itself in such way to\ntheir curiosity that it allowed them to discover how even the faintest noises\nactually cause reflections of themselves to be repeated a number of times in\na number of complementary places, although quite soon those reflections\nbecome unsuitable for any human to grasp.\n\n\nWhat could be grasped, they already knew to be echoes, but echoes\nwhose very limited number spoke more of the feebleness of their own\nconcentration than of the power that simply went on and on without regard for\naudience. \n\n \n\nIt was precisely the way ( they slowly learned) with cataclysms\nas with any simple events that were within the scope of Nature to produce - -\nfrom the birth of a continent to the untimely death of a child.\n\n\nAs hidden movements beneath the earth or wild volcanic tantrums are\nnever abruptly concluded but must continue to display, over an amazingly long\nperiod, some brooding, even godlike retrospecting ( or very plainly,\nrumblings), so too every event that happens must happen a number of times\nmore on a regressively smaller scale, or else find its sympathetic\necho-of-an-event, before it can vanish completely from history and from the\nconsciousness, not of man, but of the world. \n\n \n\nThis multiplication of events in Nature, accomplished with no\nthought given to the well-being of humankind, has always been observed as\nveering definitely toward the painful and the disastrous; and faithfully, as\nto its true North.\n\n\nThis would be a frightening matter for us humans to consider even\nbriefly, had it not been for the consoling fact that we only have one life to\nlive, thank God, even though in the course of it we may have to suffer\neverything at least twice. \n\n \n\nBut herein lies a maddening corollary to their findings, one\nwhich the old villagers understood equally well: That if Nature had been\nkinder, she might have gone on with all this but only after thoughtfully\nexcluding the element of suspense.\n\n\n( When the disaster?\n\n\nWhen its smaller twin?\n\n\nIn whose lifetime then, if not in this godforsaken lifetime?\n\n\n Etc.  ,  etc. \n\n\nThis is the element  \" that makes calamity of so long\nlife &rdquo;  - - knowing what but not when.)\n\n\nBut Nature loves being mystery woman, and filling each life with\nmystery.\n\n\nIt is also by her rule that life, be it that of a lone man or an\nentire village, cannot really begin until the mystery repeats itself over and\nover, and cannot really be over until all untoward events up to their last 'echo'\nshall have been eliminated. \n\n \n\nIn between these two points all the free space is littered with\nthe signs and wonders that are Nature 's common and uncommon offerings to\nthose who inhabit the world; myriad events that serve to brighten a life and\nmyriads more ( always more) that blot out the sun.\n\n\nYet even the happiest events must await her nod of approval, seeing\nthat the disastrous and painful things she so clearly favors are doomed to\ncontinue defying all prediction; and all this to remain so for as long as she\ninsists on her own secret and peculiar method for computing time. \n\n \n\nThus, for the intuitive elderly farmers ( dragged along as if by\nmistake into the twentieth century, but stuck in Valladolid) the most recent\nfailure of Delfin 's crops and the village 's crops was nothing if not a\nforceful recall, a gesture in nostalgic commemoration of that singular but\ntoo-soon-forgotten obliteration of Valladolid 's once-proud display on the\ndelta. \n\n \n\nIt is but fitting that the blame be assigned to those famous\nhomes of Valladolid 's premier citizens; those parables in wood and glass and\nstone, over whose glory men were thought to have challenged Nature as the new\nlords and masters of beauty.\n\n\nAt least there were still people around who saw it that way - -\npeople-echoes of people, vanishing like a dying heart 's detonations or evil\ndeeds after a true repentance. \n\n \n\n Reputedly,  those beautiful old sunken homes had\nbeen arranged neatly around a proud stone church - - a church of the size\nbefitting a parochia1 seat.\n\n\nIt was also the first church anyone could find upon leaving the city\ngoing South, some 45 kilometers away.\n\n\nDuring the disaster its half-open mouth had at first been spared the\nonrush of' mud, for the mudflow was coming from the West, while the church\nfaced East.\n\n\nBut once the mud had risen over half the height of the windows and\nbegun to harden, a new assault of rains brought on fresh flooding with a\nrenewed malevolence that sent the mud flowing again, thus finishing the job\nof the first onrush: more and yet more mud seeking out every tight-shut or\nwalled-off place it had missed before.\n\n\nIt was a first-class burial job, one that created basements out of\nground floors and threw the proud settlement back to the time before the\ninvention of stairs.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "442a6db5-0f2f-446a-a06f-b7f0b14d9503", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.340878+00:00"}

I am in a brightly-lit room  that is high-ceilinged\nand chandeliered.\n\n\nA massive, red-carpeted stairway sweeps upwards; it seems to promise\neven more grandeur in the unglimpsed chambers above.\n\n\nThe room strongly resembles a Disney fairy-tale royal banquet hall,\nand yet somehow I  know  , in a typical burst of dream-logic, that\nit is also my room, the very one I fell asleep in. \n\n \n\nI am sitting in the center of the room, at a sturdy wooden desk.\n\n\nOne by one, strange figures float through a nearby doorway that is\nten feet tall: these are the fairy god-people come to my baptism-as-writer,\nhere to bestow their respective gifts on me.\n\n\nSome of them are winged, shimmering, others are earthbound and solid.\n\n\nThey come in, dispense advice, or objects, or blessings, then wander\noff, more often than not in the direction of a nearby buffet table. \n\n \n\nFirst there is Donald Barthelme, bespectacled, wide-eyed and\nbushy-bearded, his wings a strange serrated shape and in various clashing\ncolors.\n\n\nHe hands me a laughter-colored balloon with these words imprinted on\nits rubber surface:  \" There is nothing written that cannot be\nused somewhere else. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nLorrie Moore hands me a self-help book.\n\n\nI flip through the pages to discover that they are blank, \n\" Fill 'er up,\"  she says, then goes off to the fridge for some\ncold beer. \n\n \n\nTruman Capote, dressed in a smart blazer and a smart pair of\nshorts and Gucci loafers, waddles up to me and says,  \" For God 's\nsake, practice.\n\n\nPractice, practice, practice.\n\n\nYou are an apprentice at the altar of technique, craft; learn well\nthe intricacies of paragraphing, punctuation, dialogue placement.\n\n\nNot to mention the grand overall design, the great demanding arc of\nmiddle-beginning-end. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nHaruki Murakami steps forward and places a little wind-up bird on\nthe table before me.\n\n\n \" You must travel a long way from the stuffed cabbage,\n&rdquo;  he intones enigmatically. \n\n \n\nNick Joaquin shuffles my way and offers me a swig of \"\nSan Miguel \" .\n\n\nIn the bottle I can see liquid ghosts, men and women caught in an\never-turbulent dance. \n\n \n\nGregorio Brillantes gives me a prism. \n\n \n\nMark Helprin gives me a little crystal globe with a miniature\ncity inside.\n\n\nThe globe is filled with some slow fluid, and a fine white powder has\nsettled on the city 's miniature turrets and rooftops.\n\n\nWhen I shake the globe, it snowstorms. \n\n \n\nMartin Amis sneers.\n\n\nWill Self offers me drugs.\n\n\nIan McEwan sits in a corner and stares at something invisible and\nfaraway.\n\n\nJulian Barnes regales me with a story of an Englishman in Paris. \n\n \n\nRenata Adler hands me a stack of postcards, photographs,\nanecdotes, episodes.\n\n\nShe also tells me the wittiest joke I 've ever heard. \n\n \n\nJonathan Carroll is pulling bouquets of roses from a black top\nhat.\n\n\nHe pulls out still-beating hearts, masks, crayons, kaleidoscopes.\n\n\nFinally he pulls out \" Death \" , a well-mannered,\nwide-smiled young man. \n\n \n\nFrancisco Arcellana waves his cane at me and exhorts, \n\" Write the story  only you can write! \n\n\nThe story that makes your balls  twitch!  \" \nHis empty hand claws at the air; for emphasis. \n\n \n\nAnd so it goes.\n\n\nAnd so it goes.\n\n\nEach writer brings something else, something only they can bring.\n\n\n \n\nFinally, Kurt Vonnegut, late for the affair, huffing, for his\nlungs aren't what they used to be, what with the chain-smoking, his bent arms\nswinging in a way that mimics the act of jogging, comes to my side, smiles\nand says,  \" Don't take it all so  seriously  , for\nChrissakes. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nAll of a sudden, there is a commotion near the doorway.\n\n\nThe murmuring writers gather around a gaudily-clad messenger, who\nhas a long brass trumpet in one hand and a scroll in the other.\n\n\nHe blows on the trumpet - - a short, sharp discordant blast - - and\nthen reads his announcement.\n\n\n \" The new letters are coming! &rdquo;  he\nshouts.\n\n\n \" The new letters are here! &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nWe all turn our faces heavenwards.\n\n\nThe new letters.\n\n\nInexplicably, instead of the ceiling that was once there, there is a\nvast expanse of sky, a sky as blank and white as a new sheet of foolscap.\n\n\nAnd from the sky comes pouring forth a rain of paper airplanes, a\nsquadron from nowhere, bright, agile, and wondrous, swooping down on our\nassemblage.\n\n\nOur hearts leap in anticipation: the new letters!\n\n\nWe all know instinctively that when we catch these planes and unfold\nthem, they will each contain a new symbol, to add to the twenty-odd that we\nhave been using all these years.\n\n\nWe recall fondly the works we crafted using the old letters, the\ntried-and-true letters, and our imaginations tremble in anticipation as we\nthink about what we might craft with these additions. \n\n \n\nWe raise our arms to the sky in welcome.\n\n\nIt is then that the dream warps, wobbles, and shrieks at the seams.\n\n\nThe paper airplanes morph into shining daggers, with columns of\nnumbers engraved on their blades - - and bursting out of the sun is my boss,\nlaughing maniacally and riding a chariot that is being pulled by a flock of\nDimension XPS R400s, their monitors like livid glowing eyes.\n\n\nMy boss is screaming about securities and percentages, and all\naround is the sound of panic as the daggers hit home and plunge into  a\nthousand skulls  ... \n\n \n\nAnd I wake up with a start. \n\n \n\nI wipe the sweat from my forehead, and check the digital clock\nby my bedside.\n\n\nJust enough time to print and read Raya 's story, and to rush to the\ncaf\u00e9.\n\n\nBut first, I think I need a cold bracing shower.\n\n\nYeah.\n\n\nJust the thing. \n\n \n\n A few  hours later: I 'm wide awake, and making a\npronouncement.\n\n\n \" You have a problem with endings, &rdquo;  I\nsay. \n\n \n\nRaya nods, and then waves at a passing waiter.\n\n\nWe 're sitting in a 24-hour caf\u00e9 along V.

Tan \n\n \n\n A strange delirium afflicts Sarah, bidden by music from long\nago.  \n\n \n\nAfter a solitary lunch she went to the backyard.\n\n\nCarefully, unhurriedly, as if she was going to perform some ancient\nritual, she piled dry twigs and leaves, made a hole in the middle of the\npile, and lighted a matchstick. \n\n \n\nWith a lump in her throat, she slowly untied a bundle of old\nletters.\n\n\nShe opened each letter and read every word in it, committing it to\nfragile memory, before dropping it into the crater of burning leaves.\n\n\nShe watched the swift transformation of white into black as the\ntongues of orange flame licked the edges of each letter.\n\n\nShe read the next letter, and the next.\n\n\nEach time she dropped it, the hungry flame swiftly swallowed it.\n\n\nSoon she was quietly sobbing as images of the past flit through her\nmind, conjured up by the words a romantic young girl had written to her love\nlong ago.\n\n\nMany letters recalled the contrast between the changes in the world\nof nature and the steadfastness of her affection, between the transitory\ncharacter of a turquoise sky and the waves that sweep the strand,\nobliterating the footprints, and the eternal holiness of her heart.\n\n\nThen she read his letters ( he who was the son of a Protestant\nminister), short but concise, and had the quaint rhythm of the King James\nBible, the balanced and pointed antithesis.\n\n\nYet those letters were not less passionate.\n\n\nEven when he quoted the words of Ruth, it had seemed to her then, as\nit seemed to her now, as though those words were first spoken by him... \n\n\n Entreat me not leave thee... for whither thou goest I will\ngo...   \n\n \n\nThe shrill cry of cicadas from the fire trees woke her from her\nreverie.\n\n\nShe tarried and watched the embers die out, listening to the last few\ncrackles of remaining twigs.\n\n\nShe put her wrinkled arms around her wrinkled knees and gave out a\nprimordial scream above the din of cicadas.\n\n\nThen a spasm of sobs shook her frail body. \n\n \n\nWiping her tears with the back of her hand, she passed through\nthe kitchen door.\n\n\nAs she entered the living room, the parrot in its stout, aluminum\ncage greeted her with rapid fire  \" Hello Come in Are you going\nout Goodbye, &rdquo;  the only group of sentences the Celebes bird, a\ngift to her husband from a wealthy client, managed to remember in a lifetime.\n\n\nShe gave the bird a dagger look for its impertinence, though in\nformer, noisier times she used to respond with  \" No one is\ngoing out, you son of a bird, &rdquo;  a response made fashionable by\nthe inimitable wit of the neighbor, Mrs. de la Cuesta, not only because of\nthe pun, but also because the bird was a female.\n\n\nApproaching the cage she raised a threatening hand, and the poor,\nbalding parrot winced in fear and retreated to the far end of its bar,\ndragging its tethered foot in haste.\n\n\nIn its corner it gave her a timorous and abashed look so that a\ntwinge of pity, guilt and some vague recognition of kinship shot up her spine\nto the base of her skull.\n\n\nAll at once she remembered with deep longing how she had spent one\nwhole afternoon trying to teach the bird, when it was new in the house and\neverybody 's favorite entertainer, a stanza of verses written by her\nclassmate in the graduate school many years ago.\n\n\nBy rote the bird could manage only the first four lines, but it was\nenough to make her shout triumphantly  \" She did it!\n\n\nShe did it &rdquo;  to the consternation of her children,\nwhen she heard the bird, albeit with its own bird-accent, repeat the lines:\n \" may I come in/and drink your gin/ the night is cold/ and I am\nold. &rdquo; \n\n\nThe bird, however, had a short memory for verses, and lacked\npractice, so in less than two months it could only mumble a few syllables\nintelligible to no one but itself. \n\n \n\nBut now she was in no mood to indulge in softer feelings for the\nbird, so she left it alone.\n\n\nSomething violent was spinning in her head as she moved about the\nliving room and started smashing the breakables.\n\n\nShe hurled them against the wall.\n\n\nEvery bric-a-brac hurtled though the living room: the crystal\nfigurines, the glass paperweights, the plaster gods of fertility, and the\nminiature ceramic vases of different shapes and designs.\n\n\nWith one violent sweep of her arm, the plaster menagerie on the piano\ntop crashed to the floor.\n\n\nSoon the floor of polished wood tiles was dominated by shiny shards\nand whitish fragments. \n\n \n\nShe went to her bedroom upstairs.\n\n\nThere she started tearing the bedcover, the bedsheets and the\npillowcases.\n\n\nShe smashed the pillow against the wooden headboard until they gave\nout at the seams, and tiny  kapok  feathers flew around\nher.\n\n\nShe tore up the pages of pop romances, her insomnia cure for the last\nyear, and hurled the mangled copies everywhere. \n\n \n\nShe slid to one side the door of the built-in cabinet where her\nhusband 's wardrobe was.\n\n\nOne by one she unhooked the shirts and trousers from the hangers.\n\n\nWith a pair of sharp scissors she shredded each  barong\nTagalog  , each  camisa de chino  , each\nlong-sleeved shirt, each pair of trousers, until there was a waist-high pile\nof shredded fabric on the floor. \n\n \n\nShe opened the door leading to her husband 's study room, which\nshe, in the solitude of the months following her husband 's death, kept\nimmaculately clean by sweeping the floor every day and dusting and repeatedly\nrearranging the books and old journals and magazines.\n\n\nIt was a small room, but the formal, seried ranks of law books and\nencyclopedias greeted her with a silence that made the room seem huge.\n\n\nFor a while it seemed as if the shelves reached the sky.\n\n\nEven the paperweight seemed like a huge rock rolling toward her.\n\n\nWhen she switched on the cable lamp, there was a sudden sunburst of\ncosmic intensity that blinded her.\n\n\nShe raised her arm as if to ward off the assault of the blinding\nlight.\n\n\nShe turned it off.\n\n\nShe retreated toward the door.\n\n\nWhen she pulled the doorknob behind her, the door slammed with\nthundering vibrations. \n\n \n\nThough all the music boxes, which she had bought for her four\nchildren, had long ago stopped playing their minuets and sarabands, she\nseemed to be hearing music somewhere.\n\n\nShe clambered up the high bed.\n\n\nBidden by that strange music, she slowly started to move her limbs.\n\n\nShe moved awkwardly, turning her body with great effort.\n\n\nSoon she was singing but the voice at first did not seem like her\nown.\n\n\nIt seemed to come from a great distance, the faint voice of a\nventriloquist god, the voice from the past of primordial origin, bidding her\nto dance.\n\n\nAs her voice grew louder, her lips began to shape the syllables of a\nsong of lamentation, which she had learned from her grandmother.\n\n\nThen her movements became furious and delirious, her limbs were\nuncoordinated, her head shook up and down, her long hair flew.\n\n\nLike a medium in the throes of divine revelation, she whirled madly\nabout, emitting a sound, a cry of radical pitch and timbre, and tearing at\nher hair, standing, lying down and jumping on the twisted heap of torn\nbedsheets and pillow cases.\n\n\nRepeatedly, she ripped her dress till her dry, sagging breasts were\nexposed.\n\n\nBetween grief and anger she ripped her underthings.\n\n\nLying down on her back she started gyrating her groin, thrusting it\nup and down in a gesture of imagined lovemaking, moaning, crying, cursing,\nscreaming out the name of her dead husband...\n\n\nSalathiel...\n\n\nSalathiel... \n\n \n\nWhen it was over she lay exhausted.\n\n\nAthwart the high, wide bed, with half of her body on the edge, she\ndropped her exhausted limbs, her spread arms reaching the floor.\n\n\nA convulsion of pain and pleasure, a sense of release, had overcome\nher body.\n\n\nNow a feeling of numbness settled in. \n\n \n\nThe dance had so drained her she had no more strength left to\nrise and pick up the bits and pieces scattered about in the living room.\n\n\nShe would let them be for some time.\n\n\nNo one else was in the house.\n\n\nThere was no need to pick them up--at least, not for now.\n\n\nNor, she told herself, would she go to the backyard and gather up the\nashes of burnt letters in a small measure box and carry it around wherever\nshe would go henceforth.\n\n\nShe had no need of ashes, even of those letters which had made her\nswoon when she was a coed, and which had made her swear to love him and serve\nhim as long as she lived. \n\n \n\nAfter the frenzy of her dance there was a yawning quietness in\nthe room.\n\n\nThe shreds of torn clothes and bedsheets lay peacefully in heaps and\npiles.\n\n\nThe  kapok  clouds of blown-out pillows settled\nindifferently on her numbed arms.\n\n\nOnly once in a while did she move to brush them off her face. \n\n \n\nAmong the peaceful shreds in the room she lay unmoving, among the\nthings she should have parted with a year ago.\n\n\nHer children had urged her to sell them or donate them to charitable\ninstitutions.\n\n\nShe had refused to part with them, clinging to the illusion that as\nlong as these things were in the house, as long as they surrounded her, her\nhusband was alive, his presence multiplied in them.\n\n\n Music I heard with you was more than music,  she\nrepeated in her mind a poet 's words.\n\n\nShe couldn't part with them, give them away or sell them to people to\nwhom they were material things.\n\n\nThey were not, those things in the living room and the study room,\nmere objects to adorn and clutter up a room.\n\n\nThey were parables which time left behind as it ran along.\n\n\nEach piece had a distinct genesis: how it was acquired, where, when,\nhow much, for what occasion, given by which friend.\n\n\nTogether they made up the story of their lives, first as sweethearts\nin college, then as husband and wife, and later as father and mother. \n\n \n\nLike one of the broken paperweights in the living room on which\nshe had her name inscribed below a red rose.\n\n\nShe had given it to him in college as a Valentine gift.\n\n\nOn that occasion he told her  \" Sarah, don't you mind if\nI look at other girls.\n\n\nIt is only my eyes that they command, never my heart.\n\n\nYou know to whom this ( touching his heart) belongs. &rdquo; \n\n\nComing from him, a man of few words, she could not help feeling like\nshe was in clouds.\n\n\nShe had known then that such a man was going to be her husband, and\nnot just because he was as tall as she wanted her man to be.\n\n\nWhen he had spoken those words, she couldn't care less if he had been\na midget as she snuggled cozily in his strong brown arms while the wind from\nTanon Strait, whipping up the sea below them that Saturday morning on a\npromontory by the shore, blew at her hair which he kissed with passionate\ntenderness. \n\n \n\nWhen she woke up it was late in the afternoon.\n\n\nThere was a subdued glow in the room.\n\n\nThe quietness around her, broken now and then by the cicadas, whose\nfierce, eerie cry only deepened it, made her long for the company of her son,\nwho had come home from New York ostensibly to be with her on the first death\nanniversary of his father.\n\n\nSince the anniversary was still a couple of days away when he came\nto town, Ray, as the family fondly called him, had gone scuba diving in\nSumilon Island with former high school classmates, who like himself were\nsuccessful professionals in their mid-thirties.\n\n\nSarah was expecting her youngest child, now a skilled orthopedic\nsurgeon and her endless source of pride, to be back anytime the next day to\nquietly remember with her the man to whom she had given her heart when she\nwas a romantic coed.\n\n\nShe and Ray had planned to visit the cemetery together, offer\nflowers to the dear departed before going to the nine-thirty service at the\nPresbyterian Church, have lunch with the few surviving friends of her husband 's\nat the fashionable resort hotel, and spend the rest of the afternoon\nleisurely with the orchids and anthuriums in her backyard, while Ray could go\nvisit his former college teacher who had not quite retired from service and\nstill riding the rickety bicycle which had traversed better roads.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source":

{"text": "Debt of Gratitude  \n\n\n David B. Lat \n\n \n\nLinda Reyes takes breakfast alone in her small and silent kitchen.\n\n\nA simple meal: a cup of coffee and a warm roll.\n\n\nShe eats slowly, spreading a thin layer of pale butter over the bread\nin a painstaking manner.\n\n\nHer way of eating, so deliberate and almost contemplative, would\nsurprise her colleagues.\n\n\nThey know Dr. Linda Reyes for her swiftness and intuitive efficiency\nin the hospital operating room. \n\n \n\nThose who have not seen Linda in a crowded emergency room would\nnot be surprised by her slowness.\n\n\nShe has just turned fifty but she looks much older.\n\n\nWrinkles spread over her dark face in gently expanding arcs and\ncreases.\n\n\nLinda feels most hurt when her wrinkled bony face, the mask of her\ncompassion, frightens her younger patients with their shiny pink faces and\nfull ruddy cheeks. \n\n \n\nThe bread she eats is  pan de sal  ( bread of\nsalt), but it does not taste salty and she no longer wonders why.\n\n\nThe coffee Linda drinks, lukewarm and bitter, was brewed by Talaba.\n\n\nThe housekeeper came downstairs earlier that morning, brewed the\ncoffee, then returned upstairs to sleep.\n\n\nIt is a Monday and Linda is too tired to complain about the meal or\nto scold Talaba.\n\n\nAnd given how little she pays Talaba, and how behind she is in\npayment of Talaba 's salary, she knows she can't be too demanding.\n\n\nThe dull thuds of sluggish steps on the staircase interrupt the\nsilence of Linda 's meal.\n\n\nHer husband Nilo enters the kitchen with a newspaper in his hand,\nwith his mouth half-open and eyes half-closed.\n\n\nThe face of a fish.\n\n\nShe recalls how dashing he was when she first met him, the playboy\nson of the general and ten years her junior.\n\n\nEven then she looked older than her age, and everyone said she was\ntoo thin.\n\n\nSo she felt very lucky when he proposed to her.\n\n\nEven now, with Nilo in a half-awake state, she still finds him\nattractive.\n\n\nEven now, she still feels lucky to have him. \n\n \n\nWhat is Nilo doing up this early?\n\n\nHis rising before noon is a rare occurrence, one prohibited by\nFederal and state law, as Linda jokes grimly to her friends.\n\n\nWhat does he want?\n\n\nPerhaps he needs money for one of his trips; but today is not the\ncorrect day.\n\n\nShe asks him why he is awake so early. \n\n \n\n \" I wanted to talk to you before you left for work.\n\n\nIt 's about what we talked about last night. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nLast night Linda had asked Nilo about getting a new car.\n\n\nShe had talked to her friends, to other doctors at the hospital, to\nTessie of course, and they all agreed: it was time for her to buy a new car.\n\n\nThe financing terms and interest rates were excellent and weren't\ngoing to get any better.\n\n\nNo money down.\n\n\nShe could, and probably would, worry about the payments later.\n\n\nBased as it was on these financial realities, the proposal was\nsensible, not self-indulgent.\n\n\nThe car she would buy would be practical, safe, and reliable.\n\n\nIt would get good mileage and accommodate the family comfortably.\n\n\nWhile not flashy, it would have just enough cachet for Linda to drive\nit to the weekend parties of her fellow Filipino physicians. \n\n \n\n \" I think we should get a new car, &rdquo; \nNilo announces.\n\n\nHe speaks as if the idea were his own.\n\n\n \" Okay then, &rdquo;  she says, pleased,\n \" we 'll go to the dealerships next week. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nShe sips her coffee.\n\n\nEven the hospital brew is better than this tar that Talaba calls\ncoffee. \n\n \n\n  \" Mahal, &rdquo;    Nilo says,  \" I have a question.\n\n\nAbout what car we will get. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nLinda pauses for a moment. \n\n \n\n \" A sedan, a four-door.\n\n\nI 'm not sure of what brand, &rdquo;  she says.\n\n\n\n \n\nNilo looks up from his plate to make eye contact with his wife.\n\n\n \n\n \" Lin, I think we should get something more\nexciting.\n\n\nMore adventurous. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nHe reaches over the table to place his hand on hers. \n\n \n\n \" What are you thinking of? &rdquo; \n\n\nApprehension hangs in her voice. \n\n \n\n \" A sports car, &rdquo;  Nilo says\nbrightly.\n\n\n \" A convertible.\n\n\nI like this one. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nNilo shows her the newspaper he holds in his other hand, the\nadvertisement in the corner.\n\n\nShe sees the drawing of a sleek car with aggressive lines.\n\n\nWith its strange curves and its headlights like squinting eyes, the\ncar reminds her of a snake her father once killed. \n\n \n\nLinda 's fork falls to the floor when she sees the price. \n\n \n\n \" Nilo!\n\n\n Susmariosep  , you know we can't afford that.\n\n\nAre you crazy? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nHe waits, letting her catch her breath. \n\n \n\n \" Look at it, &rdquo;  he says calmly,\nsoftly,  \" it 's a beautiful car and it only costs that much.\n&rdquo; \n\n\nHe cannot bring himself to say the amount; he merely points at the\nnumber in the newspaper.\n\n\n \" We can afford that, can't we? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nLinda thinks: Can I make those payments?\n\n\nCan I work any harder than I do now? \n\n \n\n \" I can't work more hours, &rdquo;  she\nsays,  \" I just can't.\n\n\nThat 's it. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nHer voice is not commanding but pleading, desperate.\n\n\nPerhaps she does not mean what she says.\n\n\nPerhaps what she truly means is: I could make that extra money, but\nplease, please don't make me do it.\n\n\nAnd to think that everyone believes that doctors are rich.\n\n\nShe resents the popular belief that doctors have no money problems.\n\n\nWhen you work as an underpaid doctor in an inner city public\nhospital, when your fledgling private practice can't get off the ground, when\nyou send your son to college and your daughter to an expensive summer camp,\nand when your husband piles up huge debts, then you have money problems. \n\n \n\nLinda feels Nilo squeezing her hand. \n\n \n\n\" Lin, you don't have to work more hours.\n\n\nThere are other ways.\n\n\nWe can spend less on other things.\n\n\nOr we could spend a little less, and maybe you could work a little\nmore. &rdquo; \n\n \n\nOr maybe, maybe Nilo could get a job.\n\n\nWould that be such a radical idea?\n\n\nHis weak excuses for not working are running out. \n\n \n\n \" Nilo, I really don't think that would work.\n&rdquo; \n\n \n\n \" Please, &rdquo;  he says,  \"\nplease think about it.\n\n\nFor me. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nNilo rises from the table.\n\n\nAs he leaves the room, he kisses Linda gently on the cheek.\n\n\nShe tries to hide from him the thrill she feels.\n\n\nAfter he leaves, she silently scolds herself for the schoolgirl\nreaction to his affection.\n\n\nThe kiss, a neatly packaged act of manufactured affection, meant\nnothing to Nilo, Linda knows.\n\n\nBut it still meant something to her.\n\n\nWhat will she do about this problem?\n\n\nHow can she work any harder?\n\n\nIt may not be possible.\n\n\nIf it is possible, however, then she has a duty.\n\n\nHer sense of duty, developed during the many years spent under the\nsisters of St. Catherine 's, weighs down on Linda as she sits alone in the\nkitchen. \n\n \n\nWhat student of St. Catherine 's could forget Ephesians 5?\n\n\nIt was the chapter they had drilled into them year after year, the\nchapter they were made to memorize.\n\n\nEspecially important were verses 22 through 24:   \"\nWives, be subject to your husbands, as to the Lord.\n\n\nFor the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of\nthe church, his body, and is himself its Savior.\n\n\nAs the church is subject to Christ, so let wives also be subject in\neverything to their husbands. &rdquo;  \n\n\nThese were words that Linda 's mother lived by, and words she hopes\nto live by as well. \n\n \n\nLinda drives along the Francis Lewis Boulevard with the anxious\neffort of someone who does not trust her driving skills or those of other\ncommuters.\n\n\nShe keeps the car mostly in the right lane, venturing into the\nmiddle lane only rarely and switching out at the earliest opportunity.\n\n\nShe signals lane changes and exits early, perhaps too early.\n\n\nShe drives with her hands gripping the wheel tightly, her neck\ncraned so she can look in her mirrors. \n\n \n\nDespite the effort she puts into driving, she still has time to\nreflect on other matters.\n\n\nHer thoughts turn to the home she has just left.\n\n\nWhat is Nilo doing right now?\n\n\nHe has probably returned to bed.\n\n\nMaybe he 's watching television. \n\n \n\nThe car behind Linda is tailgating her, but she won't drive any\nfaster. \n\n \n\nIf he 's in such a hurry, he can pass. \n\n \n\nWhy do I go to work every day while my husband sits at home\nwatching game shows he doesn't understand?\n\n\nWhy should I earn money to pay for his indiscretions, his petty\nvices?\n\n\nWhy should I serve him like a slave?\n\n\nThe image of red and white chips against green felt passes through\nher mind.\n\n\nShe pays while he plays, and it makes her angry to think about it.\n\n\n \n\nThen Linda catches herself.\n\n\nShe cannot entertain these thoughts; he is still her husband.\n\n\nThe words of Ephesians return to her.\n\n\nThe words of her mother, uttered in her last days, return to her\nwith a startling urgency.\n\n\nIn those pain-filled days in a crowded ward, in a nameless hospital\nin a  barrio  in Batangas, a mother shared with a daughter\nthe secrets of the world. \n\n \n\n \" Be a good girl, Linda, &rdquo;  her\nmother told her, her frail body shrouded in gray sheets that were once white.\n\n\n \" Someday you will have a family.\n\n\nCare for your children.\n\n\nServe your husband.\n\n\nThis is what God has called us to do  hija  .\n\n\nWhat we do in this life will be remembered when we enter the next.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nWhat would her mother say if she could see her daughter now?\n\n\nHer mother died when Linda was twenty.\n\n\nLinda knows her mother never expected her to survive the four long\nyears of medical school.\n\n\nHer mother had argued against sending her to medical school, despite\nher scholarship.\n\n\nMedicine was a man 's field, her mother thought, and women could not\nhandle the pressure. \n\n \n\n \" What does she need to go to med school for?\n&rdquo;  This was the question Linda 's mother asked of her father,\nin a conversation she overheard from the yard where she was hanging the\nlaundry on the clothesline. \n\n \n\n \" What she needs, &rdquo;  continued her\nmother,  \" is a good husband who will love her, provide for her,\nprotect her.\n\n\nThat 's all she needs. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nBut it did not take long for Linda 's mother to give in to her\nfather, just as she always did.\n\n\nThank God that her father prevailed in the argument, thus turning\nLinda 's going to medical school into a duty she had to fulfill for her\nfamily 's sake.\n\n\nIn medical school she received the education that gave her so many\nopportunities.\n\n\nIf not for her education, she would have nothing, because she\ncertainly didn't get the good husband. \n\n \n\nLinda wonders about what her mother would have said about buying\na new car, and more specifically, a bright new sports car.\n\n\nHow would she have resolved the conflict between her frugal nature\nand her belief in the absolute rule of the husband? \n\n \n\nThe morning shift at the Kingsview emergency room was unusually\nbusy and hectic, but Linda had made it to her lunch break at last.\n\n\nAfter eating a small salad of limp vegetables served at the hospital\ncafeteria, she returns to the doctors ' lounge, where she makes a short phone\ncall to Tessie, the person whose opinions she values above all others.\n\n\nTessie is a natural person to call for advice; their friendship\ndates back all the way to medical school at U.P.  , and Linda has always admired Tessie for her happy marriage\nand successful career. \n\n \n\nLinda won't be able to talk for long since there are only\nfifteen minutes left in her break, and she will end her break early because\nmuch work remains to be done.\n\n\nIn her day of headache and sweat, this is the only time she can\nspare. \n\n \n\n \" Hello, the Santos residence, &rdquo; \nsays Marie, Tessie 's housekeeper, speaking with a Filipino accent stronger\nbut not unlike the accents of Tessie and Linda. \n\n \n\n \" Marie?\n\n\nIt 's Linda.\n\n\nIs Tessie home? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Please hold on,  doctora  ,\n&rdquo;  Marie says, deference in her voice. \n\n \n\nTessie is on the phone shortly and greets Linda cheerfully.\n\n\nThe two engage in small talk for a few minutes.\n\n\nThen Linda outlines her upcoming decision about what car she should\nbuy.\n\n\nShe would like to listen to Nilo, but his suggestion in this case is\nboth impractical and extravagant.\n\n\nThe car he wants is simply beyond their means, she tells Tessie.\n\n\n \n\n \" Linda, I see the arguments here, &rdquo;\n Tessie says, then pauses.\n\n\n \" It 's a big decision.\n\n\nBut I think it might be about much more than a car. &rdquo; \n\n\n \n\n \" Continue, &rdquo;  says Linda.\n\n\n \" What are you trying to say? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Lin, you 're the one earning the money, &rdquo;\n Tessie continues confidently.\n\n\n \" You 're the one who is working eighty hours a week\nto make ends meet.\n\n\nYou should take decisions like this one into your hands entirely.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nLinda shifts uncomfortably in the red vinyl chair.\n\n\nWhat Tessie says makes sense to her. \n\n \n\n \" I can't do that, Tessie, I can't.\n\n\nI wasn't brought up to be like that.\n\n\nNeither were you. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" I understand that, &rdquo;  Tessie says.\n\n\n \" I was taught as you were.\n\n\nBut we 're in America now; this isn't Batangas and now things are\nvery different.\n\n\nRelationships aren't always controlled by the man.\n\n\nFinancial decisions aren't always made by the man.\n\n\nThey should be made by the person or people working hard to pay the\nbills. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nLinda pauses in thought before responding. \n\n \n\n \" But now I 'm thinking that Nilo 's right about\nthe car... &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Linda, don't let him make your decisions for\nyou.\n\n\nCan you handle the payments? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" I 'm not sure, &rdquo;  she says\nhesitantly.\n\n\n \" I 'm really not sure. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" No matter what you do, make certain that the\ndecision you make is your own, and not your rationalization of his decision,\n&rdquo;  Tessie says firmly. \n\n \n\nAs usual, Tessie has provided wise counsel, although there are\nsome things Linda knows Tessie will never understand about her, such as why\nshe married Nilo, why she loves him so intensely even after all she has been\nthrough with him, and how much she needs the emotional anchoring of his\n cari&ntilde;o  . \n\n \n\nLinda thanks her friend and then hangs up.\n\n\nShe stands up from her chair and starts putting her white jacket\nback on.\n\n\nTime to return to work. \n\n \n\nIt is a few minutes before midnight, and Linda is now on her\nevening break.\n\n\nShe finishes her black coffee while standing next to the counter of\nthe small kitchen in the doctor 's lounge.\n\n\nShe could sit down on the battered gray couch, but standing is her\ncustom.\n\n\nNow she will return to the emergency room although she doesn't have\nto return yet.\n\n\nShe has five minutes left in her break and she can still taste the\nstrong coffee.\n\n\nBut Linda never uses all of the time she receives for breaks; there\nis work to be done.\n\n\nThe doctors back home took long breaks, napping or having \nmerienda  while the patients waited for them in the operating room.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a4666616-f53b-4d22-8336-56e5011bdceb", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.344553+00:00"}

Maraan \n\n \n\nTHE LAST OF MY visitors bends over just slightly, and whispers so\nthat only I can hear.\n\n\n \" I will follow, &rdquo;  he says. \n\" In sleep. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nHis face hangs sadly over this plate of glass, and I recognize his\npain, though my eyes are shut and still.\n\n\nHoracio is old now, a fragile soul whose hair has greyed like mine.\n\n\nWe are mere shells of what we once were, but he has not forgotten.\n\n\nHe cannot have forgotten. \n\n \n\nAfter all, we have been fixtures on this street for over seventy\nyears. \n\n \n\nBut you never knew about Horacio and myself, did you?\n\n\nI am sure that the stories you have been hearing are quite a\nsurprise.\n\n\nEverything happened such a long time before you were born.\n\n\nIt should all be irrelevant now. \n\n \n\nThe women in this room think otherwise, as you can see.\n\n\nThey make quite a fuss over Horacio 's arrival, speaking in hushed\nvoices about how silly he is, to be weeping over a woman he should have\nmarried long ago.\n\n\nThey say that Horacio murmurs to himself too often, that he isn't of\nmuch use to anyone anymore, and hasn't been for quite some time.\n\n\nHe has lived his life wastefully, wallowing in regret. \n\n \n\nMy dear Horacio.\n\n\nI do wish that you had understood me a little better. \n\n \n\nI MUST TELL YOU, Corazon, seven and a half decades in this world\nis reason enough for me to be thankful.\n\n\nYou know,  Nanay   was not as\nfortunate.\n\n\nShe died from the cholera during the rainy season, at the age of\nthirty-four.\n\n\nThe photograph you keep of her was taken at a studio in the city,\nbefore any of us were born.\n\n\nIt is said that she was a handsome woman, and you always liked to\nthink that you took after her. \n\n \n\n Tatay   had to care for all\nof us, then--me and your two uncles, and of course your father.\n\n\nSince I was the eldest and the only daughter, I naturally received\nmore attention than the other three, I had all my own clothes, while my\nbrothers shared shirts, pants and shoes.\n\n\nYour poor father, being the youngest, was the worst off: whatever he\ngot to wear was always beaten and weatherworn, in sizes that were\nconsequently an embarrassment. \n\n \n\nBut we had a generally happy life.\n\n\nIt wasn't quite the same sort of life that you have now, but in our\ntime it was the best kind of life we knew.\n\n\n Tatay  always took your father with him on his old\nhorse, and they would stay at the  kapihan   from early morning till suppertime.\n\n\nSummers were the best, when we would go to the  bukid \n and laze under the  kaimito   trees.\n\n\nWe had many friends, and the boys would bring guitars to join in the\n harana   .\n\n\nSometimes, we would go off to Tagaytay, to the picnic grove, and\nstroll through the hills.\n\n\nI always wore my prettiest dress--I had quite a few before the war\nbroke out. \n\n \n\nThe occupation did not leave us without its own stories.\n\n\nWhen the American troops landed they recruited local scouts, and I\nwas one of the first women to sign up.\n\n\nThey gave me an official identification card and a badge I wore\nloyally.\n\n\nWe helped distribute rations to the soldiers in the  barrio\n ; in turn, we were given foodstuff and soap to take home.\n\n\nWe were also able to brush up on our English, constantly amusing the\nAmericans in our attempts to do so. \n\n \n\nOne day the troops left for Manila and the Japanese returned,\ninsidiously calling for the townsfolk to meet in Tagaytay.\n\n\nYour father, your uncle Doroy and their gangmates went off to the\ncity 's municipal hall, where many others had gathered.\n\n\nIt was only then that they discovered the Japanese would decapitate\nall who were present.\n\n\nEach was to kneel on the side of the hill that faced the volcano, and\nsubmit himself to the sword.\n\n\nFortunately, my brothers escaped unharmed. \n\n \n\nLater, we joined the families who went to Tagaytay to bury their\ndead.\n\n\nWe searched for the heads of the headless, thrown into a pile at the\ntop of the hill.\n\n\nBut a few had rolled far into the lake, and so were left to guard the\nwaters. \n\n \n\nYOUR UNCLE NANI WAS the first among my brothers to marry.\n\n\nHe was also the first to leave a widow, because he was killed in\nBataan during the war.\n\n\nHe and your Aunt Gilda had one child, a daughter, who died in your\nfather 's arms at the innocent age of three.\n\n\nThe pneumonia took her just after the war, when doctors were scarce\neven in the city.\n\n\nGilda, though she has lived alone ever since, has not neglected her\nties to the family.\n\n\nShe is and always has been a woman of admirable quality. \n\n \n\nYour uncle Doroy married some years after Nani did, taking for\nhimself a woman fifteen years younger than he.\n\n\nShe hailed from a neighboring  barrio  , and was\nnot like any of us who were occupied with sewing and embroidery.\n\n\nShe was an athlete, a tiny woman who had been a sprinter in school,\nand knew nothing about domestic chores.\n\n\nSo your uncle Doroy did all the cooking and housework; he took care\nof the farm as well. \n\n \n\nTrinidad only learned the duties of a spouse after giving birth\nto your cousins Felicia and Oca; she lost a third child that was stillborn.\n\n\nDoroy nevertheless continued to spoil her, and always came to her\ndefense when we would quarrel.\n\n\nHe loved Trinidad with uncompromising loyalty; it was then a bitter\nloss she suffered the day he fell over and expired. \n\n \n\nYour father Aldo was the last to marry, and he did so rather\nlate.\n\n\nAfter a long and unpredictable courtship, he left his new bride in\nour home and sailed off to work as a seaman.\n\n\nI must admit, Leonora and I never quite got along too well.\n\n\nShe carried most of the burden of my difficult ways, and for good\nreason: she was the last of my sisters-in-law, into whose care I left the\nyoungest of my brothers. \n\n \n\nBy this time  Tatay  had passed on, and no one\ncould claim the authority to put me in my place.\n\n\nAs the oldest sibling, I felt that I should be able to run the\nhousehold in the manner I thought was best.\n\n\nI felt that it was unthinkable for anyone to contradict me.\n\n\nAnd I was unmindful of how haphazard or tactless my methods might\nhave been. \n\n \n\nHardheaded, I believe, is the word they 've often used.\n\n\nYes, that 's likely the image by which I 've best been known. \n\n \n\nOCA HAS A HARD time dealing with the fact that I am no longer\nhere.\n\n\nHe has only dared to approach my casket once, to give me a sideways\nglance.\n\n\nHe can barely believe the sight of me. \n\n \n\nYou really mustn't blame Oca for what happened--after all, it was\npartly my own doing.\n\n\nPerhaps it was mostly my doing, because I spoiled him so.\n\n\nBut you must understand he is your only male cousin on our side of\nthe family--the only male heir--and it is he who will carry the family name.\n\n\n \n\nWe women have tried to make it easy for him, especially since he\nhas always stood in Felicia 's shadow.\n\n\nWhat were we to do when she garnered all the school honors and\nexcelled in elocution?\n\n\nPoor Oca was left so far behind he could never catch up with her, and\nhe didn't bother trying.\n\n\nLater, we attempted to send him to a vocational school in the city,\nbut he would only end up spending his tuition money on lesser pleasures. \n\n \n\nNone of this surprised us.\n\n\nHe had such low morale. \n\n \n\nEven when we were able to get him a job, everyone had such high\nexpectations of him.\n\n\nEventually the pressure got to him and he figured in that scandal\nand--well, we didn't force him to find work elsewhere.\n\n\nWe thought it might be best for him to just stay with us here in the\n barrio  .\n\n\nBut we never expected him to actually do work on the farm, the way\nhis father did. \n\n \n\nOca just isn't used to doing strenuous work. \n\n \n\nAs for the drinking--well you know, all the men in the \nbarrio  are drinkers.\n\n\nIt is but normal for a man, if he wants to show he really is a man.\n\n\nAnd we can't blame Oca for drinking a little more than the others,\nwhat with the responsibility of having to put three sons through primary\nschool.\n\n\nIt is quite a predicament for him, and his wife hardly works at all.\n\n\n \n\nYou really mustn't blame Oca for what happened to me, Corazon.\n\n\nA man like him just can't be helped. \n\n \n\nIN A PLACE WHERE time is absent, I see its work more clearly.\n\n\nTime breathes its energies into the world, and things happen.\n\n\nThat is when stories take shape. \n\n \n\nThis is the story of Horacio. \n\n \n\nHe came into the world just shy of a year before I did, and we\nhappened to be neighbors.\n\n\nBut we did not actually grow up together.\n\n\nWe attended the same school, and walked home down the same streets.\n\n\nWe were acquainted with the same people, and even had mutual\nfriends.\n\n\nBut we were never aware of each other 's existence--not until those\ndifficult years before the war. \n\n \n\nOne day, he had seen me from his window, as I was on my way to\nattend the evening novena. \n\n \n\nThat was the moment it began, in the summer we had graduated\nfrom school.\n\n\nPerhaps for lack of things to occupy his idle mind, then, I became\nhis great obsession.\n\n\nOnce decided, he lost no time in finding out who I was, where I\nlived, what I was like, and what things interested me.\n\n\nMost important, he had to know if I was betrothed to anyone; when he\nlearned I was not, his whole world brightened.\n\n\nHe laughed in the streets, like a madman. \n\n \n\nEveryone thought him kind of strange. \n\n \n\n Tatay  was not particularly pleased.\n\n\nI myself was fairly amused by Horacio 's antics, especially on that\nafternoon when, after much fanfare, he arrived at our doorstep with an armful\nof flowers.\n\n\nAnd that insufferable grin!\n\n\nTo me, nothing could have been more silly.\n\n\nNo one could have been sillier. \n\n \n\nBut  Tatay  was in no mood for such matters, and\nhe let his will be known.\n\n\nHoracio waited anxiously to be received; unfortunately, I could not\nentertain visitors who were frowned upon.\n\n\nAnd so, I simply watched as  Tatay  rose from his\nchair, stolidly.\n\n\nHe approached my would-be suitor, and took a single look at his\nface.\n\n\nThen he squinted and, as if to shut out the glare, closed the door.\n\n\nIn the quiet that followed, I wondered about Horacio.\n\n\nI wondered how he must have felt, to be shamed on our front\ndoorstep.\n\n\nI wondered how he could have been so silly in the first place.\n\n\nMost of all, I wondered how he could have cast such darkness upon my\nfather 's face. \n\n \n\nFELICIA HAS BEEN SITTING at my bier, telling stories about my\nstereotyped quirks.\n\n\nShe has gone on for the past two hours about how I have spoiled her\nchildren, and Oca 's children, and about how incapable I am of disciplining a\nchild. \n\n \n\nPerhaps she has a point.\n\n\nBecause after all, it was none other than I who raised her. \n\n \n\nThis likely accounts for her precocious behavior at the most\ninappropriate times.\n\n\nWhile you searched through my belongings for anything that might\nhave been of value ( since I had not prepared a will and was in no position\nto point these out to you myself), you caught her trying my jewelry on for\nsize--even as I lay lifeless in an adjacent room. \n\n \n\nShe has never really been discreet, you will say. \n\n \n\nYou have seen her put all my clothing into countless piles,\ngasping over the vast wardrobe I have accumulated.\n\n\nAnd I will admit, perhaps a third of all I ever purchased never\nactually left my dresser drawers.\n\n\nBut still you must understand, we are speaking of a good fifty years '\nworth of clothing.\n\n\nA woman like myself should certainly have been allowed some personal\nindulgences, wouldn't you say? \n\n \n\nFelicia will remind one and all of my fickle, meticulous, and\nunreasonably demanding ways.\n\n\nAnd she will mark these qualities as the cause of my spinsterhood.\n\n\nShe will accuse me of doing every undesirable thing--as though she\nherself was not guilty of such behavior. \n\n \n\nIt is her being married and having children that have exempted\nher from ridicule--from ostracized circumstances, such as my own. \n\n \n\nAND SO THEY SEE me lying here and they sigh,  poor woman!\n\n\nTo have died all alone!  \n\n \n\nAnd so they turn to you and say,  poor child!\n\n\nDo not dare follow in her footsteps!  \n\n \n\nI think I may have told you that very same thing, Corazon, on\none occasion or two.\n\n\nAt times I would come visiting your family in the city for a week,\nand find that some young man--who had obviously dressed with much effort--had\npresented himself at your doorstep.\n\n\nOh, you would make such a face! \n\n \n\nBut of course, you were always the smart one.\n\n\nYour father never realized that his terror tactics were futile,\nsince you had a mind of your own.\n\n\nAnyone else could have seen that you were fully capable of scaring\naway any poor soul who believed himself worthy. \n\n \n\nAnd now that your father is gone and I am gone, I know that you\nwill stay relentlessly on guard. \n\n \n\nI understand your reasons well. \n\n \n\nI have never told you this, but I have always wanted to live on\nmy own.\n\n\nFor though I have kept what has been my own home since your uncles\nmoved away, I have always had some niece or nephew to harbor here; their\nchildren were eventually left in my care as well.\n\n\nI have always wanted some quiet space where I could live in\nsolitude.\n\n\nBut this dream has gone unfulfilled.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "3d7cfbb1-a375-4dd1-bcf9-42e26959ff46", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.346073+00:00"}
{"text": "The Glass Daughter  \n\n\n Katrina B. Villa \n\n \n\nSHE saw the handwriting on the envelope, and recognized it\nimmediately.\n\n\nHer mother was going through the day 's mail and had handed the letter\nto her. \n\n \n\n \" No sender 's name, just a return address in New\nJersey.\n\n\nAnyone I know? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nShe told her mother no, guilty at having to lie.\n\n\nHer mother seemed satisfied with her explanation that it was from a\nclassmate who had migrated.\n\n\nIt wasn't entirely untrue.\n\n\nWould it upset her if she found out it was from him?\n\n\nHe was in New Jersey after all.\n\n\nWasn't that distance enough from her daughter? \n\n \n\nHe had been gone now for half a year.\n\n\nShe was not expecting to hear from him.\n\n\nHad stopped expecting, since she had already put away all thoughts\nand unanswered questions about him.\n\n\nIt was how she dealt with the vague sense of loss she felt each time\nhe came to mind. \n\n \n\n \" Loss? &rdquo;  she imagined her mother\nsaying if she knew how she felt.\n\n\n \" For God 's sake, Gina, don't be so melodramatic!\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nShe held the unopened envelope.\n\n\nShe felt more alone than ever.\n\n\nShe looked at her mother, who was now standing in the kitchen with\nher back to her daughter.\n\n\nShe was talking to someone on the telephone. \n\n \n\nAS a child, she had been fascinated by her mother.\n\n\nShe remembered looking through the stair railings down at the parties\nher mother often gave.\n\n\nShe would picture herself weaving invisibly through the well-dressed\ncrowd below.\n\n\nLike a soft wind she would move around stranger after glittering\nstranger until she found her mother. \n\n \n\nThere she would be, in conversation with one of her guests.\n\n\nGina would pretend that she was that guest, the happy recipient of\nher mother 's attention.\n\n\nHer mother would listen patiently to what she was saying.\n\n\nThen she would smile, and at that moment she would become real to her\ndaughter.\n\n\nThe distance and the coldness would disappear, and how she would love\nthat time with her mother. \n\n \n\nAt all other times, her mother treated her with a formality she\ndid not understand.\n\n\nTo her daughter she was a doll in a store window.\n\n\nPerfect, needed, untouchable. \n\n \n\nAs she grew older, she began to piece together details of her\nmother 's life.\n\n\nShe gathered them from conversations, stories told never by asking,\nbut only by waiting and listening.\n\n\nShe wanted explanations to her mother 's inaccessibility. \n\n \n\nTime and again she would be told of the sacrifices her mother had\nmade for her daughter 's security and reputation. \n\n \n\n \" When your father left you had nothing.\n\n\nThanks to your mom, look where you are now! &rdquo;  a\n Tita   had told her once. \n\n \n\n \" Your mother worked hard to give you everything\nyou have now, &rdquo;  another said,  \" You must be\ngrateful and love her for that. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nShe tried to tell them she knew, and that she was truly grateful.\n\n\nIf there was anyone who loved her mother, it was she.\n\n\nFrom childhood she searched for ways to let her mother know this, and\nshe waited for some sign that she was getting through.\n\n\nReassurance came in the form of other people 's comments.\n\n\nHer mother 's friends would remark on what a wonderful daughter she\nhad.\n\n\nHer mother would smile, and then proceed to tell them of Gina 's\nlatest achievement in school.\n\n\nShe would go on and on about her daughter, and this was how she knew\nthat her mother loved her back. \n\n \n\nHer mother took pride in the fact that she had raised a child\nalone so well.\n\n\n \" An absent father is never an excuse, &rdquo; \nshe would be told whenever she was less than the daughter she was expected to\nbe.\n\n\nThis meant a number of things to her mother: good grades, impeccable\nmanners.\n\n\nGratitude.\n\n\nObedience. \n\n \n\nIt wasn't difficult to obey her mother.\n\n\nIn fact, it was effortless.\n\n\nAs she grew older, she saw that wanting what her mother wanted\nbrought them together.\n\n\nBetween them there was none of the tension Gina 's friends always\nseemed to have with their own mothers.\n\n\nIt was a simple existence being her mother 's daughter once she\nunderstood the importance of obeying her.\n\n\nTheir life together was clear and smooth. \n\n \n\nTHE first time she told her mother about him, her mother listened\nthoughtfully.\n\n\nTwice a week that semester, she parked her car in front of the same\nbuilding to attend class.\n\n\nAt the same time she pulled in, another car would arrive, and a young\nman would step out.\n\n\nAs the semester wore on, they had become familiar strangers to one\nanother.\n\n\nThey smiled or sometimes exchanged greetings as they saw each other\narrive and leave. \n\n \n\nOne day he simply walked up to her and introduced himself.\n\n\nHe accompanied her as she headed for her class.\n\n\nWhen the class ended, he was there waiting to walk with her back to\nthe parking lot.\n\n\nThis went on for two weeks before he asked her if he could take her\nto lunch.\n\n\nShe agreed, and they took his car to a small  cafe\n not too far from school.\n\n\nHe hardly ate that first time.\n\n\nHe was busy asking questions about her, and telling her whatever came\nto mind. \n\n \n\nThey went to lunch together a few more times after that.\n\n\nThey exchanged stories and looked for things they had in common. \n\n \n\nHe was one of the growing numbers of Filipinos whose families,\nlike hers, no longer lived happily under one roof.\n\n\nBut unlike her, he stayed with neither parent.\n\n\nHis mother and father each had families of their own now. \n\n \n\n \" I 'm the thing they have in common, &rdquo;\n he told her. \n\n \n\nHe was the lucky recipient of their separate versions of\ngenerosity.\n\n\nA car.\n\n\nThe house in Manila.\n\n\nA constant arrival of  'padala'  that reached him\nthrough  balikbayan  friends of his parents: \n\n \n\n \" Hello, I 'm so-and-so, a friend of your mother 's.\n\n\nShe heard I was coming to Manila so she asked me to bring you this.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" I 'm your dad 's business partner up in\nVancouver.\n\n\nI have a letter and a check for you from him.\n\n\nCould you come over and pick it up? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nHe said he sometimes wondered if they drew lots to decide whose\nturn it was to send him something.\n\n\nMaybe they had a schedule worked out in advance to make sure their\nson received a phone call from either of them regularly.\n\n\nThey checked up on him, often enough.\n\n\nHe would reassure them that he was all right.\n\n\nThe house had not burned down, and the car still looked brand new.\n\n\nSchool was fine, and his part-time job with a family friend was okey\ntoo.\n\n\nHe would be graduating soon, and when he did, he would pay more bills\nat home.\n\n\nHe had got a dog, it was house-broken now, and no, he didn't want to\njoin either of them, but thanks for asking again anyway.\n\n\nHe enjoyed his pseudo-independent lifestyle in Manila.\n\n\nSort of. \n\n \n\nHe no longer maintained ties with relatives, either.\n\n\nShe wondered what it felt like, spending Christmas and other holidays\nat friends ' parties, or as an anonymous reveller in some crowded bar. \n\n \n\nSHE told her mother she felt sorry for him.\n\n\nHer mother said she was sorry too.\n\n\nHer tone was the same one she used whenever she commented on street\nchildren, pregnant teenage actresses, or animals that had been run over in\nthe South Expressway.\n\n\nIt was the tone reserved for situations brought about by other\npeople 's lack of responsibility. \n\n \n\n \" Your new friend however, &rdquo;  she\ntold her daughter,  \" isn't the victim he might appear to be.\n&rdquo; \n\n\nShe remarked on the ungrateful way he talked about his parents.\n\n\nAnd wasn't he a bit too forward, she added.\n\n\nShe was disturbed by the casual way they met, and more so by the\napparent haste with which Gina went with him. \n\n \n\n \" What would people say?\"  \n\n \n\nShe waited for her mother to continue.\n\n\nShe was somehow relieved when the older woman just stood up without\nsaying anything else. \n\n \n\nGINA continued to see him.\n\n\nShe looked forward to their lunches, and he had already started\ncalling her at home.\n\n\nOne day, he came to visit.\n\n\nShe introduced him to her mother.\n\n\nShe was very polite to him. \n\n \n\nAfter he left, mother and daughter sat down to dinner. \n\n \n\n \" I thought you weren't seeing him anymore,\n&rdquo;  her mother said. \n\n \n\nShe sat there, thinking of a reply.\n\n\nShe was looking for something to say, like  \" I thought\nyou knew. &rdquo; \n\n\nOr maybe  \" I enjoy his company. &rdquo; \n\n\nAnything. \n\n \n\nHer mother spoke again. \n\n \n\n \" Daughters are precious things.\n\n\nBeautiful and fragile, like glass.\n\n\nI did not take such pains to raise you only to have you end up with\nsomeone like him. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nHer daughter could say nothing. \n\n \n\n \" It would be good for you to distance yourself\nfrom him. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nHe was never brought up in conversation again. \n\n \n\nWHEN her mother found out that she was still seeing him even\nafter that night, she did not express anger or disappointment.\n\n\nShe simply stopped talking to her daughter.\n\n\nGina had simply been removed from view. \n\n \n\nThe distance and coldness which she had dreaded as a child had\nreturned.\n\n\nShe panicked.\n\n\nAt the parking lot the next day, she spoke to him.\n\n\nShe would not see him again, she told him, and he asked why.\n\n\nWas it something he said, or did?\n\n\nShe had difficulty explaining.\n\n\nOut came a jumble of reasons, all of which had to do with her\nmother. \n\n \n\nHe listened, and said he understood.\n\n\nAnd then, almost as an afterthought, he asked,  \" But\nwhat do you want? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nShe was thrown by the question.\n\n\nWhat did she want? \n\n \n\nShe thought of her mother.\n\n\nShe remembered all the stories she had been told.\n\n\nThe importance of gratitude, and obedience.\n\n\nShe remembered how she watched for a change of expression in her\nmother 's face whenever she did something that pleased her.\n\n\nHoping, waiting for a smile, some reassurance. \n\n \n\nAll her life she had tiptoed around her mother, raw with\nanticipation for her moment when she would be seen and held.\n\n\nShe never asked, only waited. \n\n \n\nThere wasn't anything she wanted that was separate from her\nmother.\n\n\nOr was there?\n\n\nThey stood there, quiet.\n\n\nHe seemed sadder when he asked her again.\n\n\n \" What do you want? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nBecause there wasn't anything else, she said,  \" I\nwant what my mother wants, &rdquo;  and walked away. \n\n \n\nSHE found out through friends that he left for the States after\ngraduation.\n\n\nHe had long ago been petitioned by his mother, and everyone\nconcluded that he was just waiting for the right time to leave.\n\n\nShe only wished she had been able to say goodbye, or good luck.\n\n\nOr maybe that she was sorry.\n\n\nAnything. \n\n \n\nIt took a while, but she was able to return to the routine she\nhad with her mother.\n\n\nThere was a lot of relief in that, and she pointed this out to\nherself whenever she wondered about him. \n\n \n\nSHE was still telling herself that as she went to her room to\nread his letter. \n\n \n\nHe wrote to say that he had gotten settled ( whatever that\nmeans), and was putting together a new existence too far removed from\neverything he knew.\n\n\nThat, and a few other details about his new job, the apartment he\nwas renting, the American friends with whom he would go out to Greenwich\nVillage on weekends. \n\n \n\nShe thought it sounded like a form letter--something you could\nmake copies of and send to every relative back home.\n\n\nExcept of course there was no one of the sort he would write home\nto.\n\n\nShe knew that. \n\n \n\n \" You 're the first person I 've written to since\nI left, &rdquo;  he said as if he read her thoughts.\n\n\n \" I don't know if you believe me, but you are the\nclosest thing to family I had in Manila. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" You were also the reason I had to finally leave.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nHe said that after her it had suddenly become unbearable being\nalone. \n\n \n\n \" Being around you made me want things.\n\n\nReal things, like family.\n\n\nSomeone to come home to.\n\n\nWhen you told me how it was going to be that day in the parking lot,\nI came to realize that there was nothing for me in Manila.\n\n\nSo I left. &rdquo;

 is a verbal\n fandango  for people in their sixties who gracefully ward\noff, without the help of derrick jobs, the  fiat  of time\nwith neatness and style and a few well-chosen cosmetics.\n\n\nAt one time, she had taught school but decided early enough that all\nthat five-foot-four endearing young charm could better be used as a flight\nstewardess.\n\n\nThis, rather than endless lesson planning for forty-to-a-classroom\nsnotty-nosed kids.\n\n\nBut it was when smarty pants digs like   coffee? tea? or\nme?   had yet to be.\n\n\nWhen the fly-now-pay-later sales concept would have been for the\nbirds; when passengers bought their tickets at the airport counter and\nsurrendered these when the plane was well into the clouds and there was no\nknown case of some Slippery Sam having been pushed out from up there because\nhe had slipped in with the baggage loader.\n\n\nYes, Ann was quite lively.\n\n\nIt was probably one of the reasons why Joe married her, partial to\nbeauty that he was, although it was also said that she waylaid Joe like he\nwas the last man on earth.\n\n\nBut then there 's no accounting for directions projectiles of acids\ntake--in this case, of course, from across the aisle in the groom 's section.\n\n\nBut it was a fine middle-middle class wedding all told. \n\n \n\nJose ( look, he even had a bread-and-butter name, taken after the\ncarpenter saint, but which in the inevitable process of crisp acculturation\nbecame Joe) was predictable enough.\n\n\nThe Filipino \" good &rdquo;

their children were finding it more\nlucrative to work as clerks, day laborers,   lavanderas \n  and, yes, there was even a singing barber\nservicing a platoon of American G.I. s whose tents were spread under the\ncoconut groves.\n\n\nWhen the soldiers left, inclinations were no longer for tenancy and\nthe children of landlords would not take another look at one more glassful of\nfresh coconut toddy.\n\n\nJoe?\n\n\nAll he wanted was to build houses. \n\n \n\nBut did Joe ever regret giving up varsity?\n\n\nDid his heart turn a bitter twist when he watched schoolmates walk\naway with cheers and pennants and loving cups?\n\n\nHe never gave any indication.\n\n\nIt seemed that all the looking back he did was that: through the\nyears there was nothing in the world that could keep him out of ringside\nMemorial Stadium during basketball seasons or, if out of town, nothing that\ncould keep him away from ringside television set.\n\n\nHe cheered, cursed, laughed, tsk-tsking mistakes, slapping the arm of\nhis chair, a piece of furniture of splendid construction and by now with a\nkind of lived-in stuffing.\n\n\nDuring the commercial, he would reach out for an orange, popcorn,\npotato chips, peanuts, pop drinks--just like what those in the bleachers were\ndoing.\n\n\nNo, no beer.\n\n\nHe neither drank nor smoked.\n\n\nIt was no little puzzle then to folks when they were told that he had\ncancer of the liver. \n\n \n\nDoctors.\n\n\nThe first, a young   balikbayan    , supervised the tests, examined this father of\nhis best friend.\n\n\nHe said,   John, I 'm afraid your Daddy 's case is\nterminal.\n\n\nThe best that can be done,   he said,   is to\nkeep him as comfortable as possible and prepare him spiritually  .\n\n\n\nThen he added,   But w-e-l-l, you might take him to an\ninternist.  \n\n\nThen he took off for Canada, to make good the requirements of his\ngreen card. \n\n \n\nThe internist ordered for more tests, identical to the first\nones, kept Joe in the hospital and himself hied off for a five-day sojourn in\ncool Hong Kong.\n\n\nWhen he came back, he endorsed Joe to a specialist who himself had\njust flown in from parts of Europe.\n\n\nThis one was to operate, expose the patient to the rays--the works!\n\n\nThe fee was astronomical.\n\n\nHope does not come cheap.\n\n\n  No, Doc   , Joe said, turning rural, \n if I have to cough up all that, I 'll have to sell my  carabao\n   .\n\n\nThe specialist said,   no, you 'd have to sell hundreds of\n carabaos   . \n\n\nA crisp urban put-down.\n\n\n  If I 'm going to die anyway, damn if you 'll get any of\nmy  carabaos  .  \n\n\nYokel Joe went home. \n\n \n\nFood.\n\n\nJoe knew and enjoyed food and at one period in his life showed it:\nthe expanded girth, the chubby cheeks, the booming laugh of the well-fed.\n\n\nBut he dropped the pounds when it was time.\n\n\nHis best friend 's ticker covered with fat had quit and his widow\nblamed pork  adobo  .\n\n\nJoe took the cue from there.\n\n\nHe took to jogging, walking, and hopping.\n\n\nIn hole-in-the-wall discos, he sweated it out to the beat of beat\nmusic taking along face towels, the ones printed with messages of smiling\ngoodwill in red Chinese characters on one end and on the other end, the\ntranslation in Roman: Good Morning.\n\n\nIndeed, Joe 's common gestures were of good will, gusty, teasing\nhumor.\n\n\nA wisecrack here, there, corn a-plenty. \n\n \n\nAnyway, food.\n\n\nForeigners remark on the Filipino fascination for food.\n\n\n You 're always eating,  they say.\n\n\nAsians do, really.\n\n\nThere seems to be a philosophy behind it or it won't be charming.\n\n\nA gracious Chinese lady welcomes one to her house on a hot summer day\nwith a glass of cold fruit juice.\n\n\n  Drink   , she urges.\n\n\nMinutes after, she asks,  C.R.? \n\n\n\" C.R. \" is \" comfort room \" , a\nPhilippine euphemism for \" toilet \" , mincing steps away\nfrom \" Ladies/Gentlemen \" .\n\n\nNowhere in other English-speaking countries are they \"\n\" comfort rooms. &rdquo;

he got them. \n\n \n\nMartha, a sister, had flown in from California, taking time off\nfrom the nursing home duties to be with her sick brother.\n\n\nFrom the airport, she went straight to his bedside.\n\n\nShe bent over to kiss him, smooth his brow and is yet surprised to\nfeel shoulder blades pushing against skin cover.\n\n\nIn a short while, she opened a valise.\n\n\nGifts for just about everyone.\n\n\nBut ah! three pairs of Florsheim shoes, a pair, of course, for Joe.\n\n\nHe 's so pleased.\n\n\nHe holds up the very elegant pair.\n\n\nThey seem to have dropped out of the pages of \"  Esquire\n \" .\n\n\nThen softly he says,   What use would I have for this\nnow?  \n\n\nA pall, dark, cold, sweeps over the room.\n\n\nNow he ups and verbalizes the truth; how inconsiderate of him.\n\n\nMartha winces, breathes deeply.\n\n\nBut, brightening just as quickly, says,   I thought you\nmight wear them to my wedding.  \n\n\nShe 's overweight by twenty pounds and sassy as hell, but that 's\nnot why they met her statement with laughter.\n\n\nThey 're all familiar with the story of one of her charges--an old\nman, carcass of a once-warrior who had to be helped to the bathroom, who\noffered to marry her.\n\n\nThe old codger never missed an opportunity to pinch her ass.\n\n\nThen she threatened to sue for sexual harassment.\n\n\nHe was so flattered, he almost died laughing.\n\n\nAt this point Martha would end her narrative:   I 'm not\nkidding, we had to clamp on the respirator.  \n\n\nThey laughed over it again, adding other asides, laughed again.\n\n\nThe thought of death is scuttled into the atmosphere, which the wife\nconstantly sprays with verbena scent from a mauve aerosol can.\n\n\nNow the son tries on the gleaming Florsheim.\n\n\nHis face brightens,   Hey look, they fit me! \n\n\n\nJoe smiles.\n\n\nEverybody o-h-hs, a-h-hs.\n\n\nAll is right again. \n\n \n\nThere is no shortage of advice.\n\n\nAnything from dietary changes, restrictions, musts, a trip to a cave\nin Laguna, the mountains of Pangasinan, an ancient church in Cebu, an open\nfield in a politician 's cash-strapped bailiwick in La Union, where an\nopen-faced youth directs the multitude to look straight into the glaring sun\nfor the vision of the Blessed Virgin;

Leveriza \n\n \n\nABEL DIA surfaced from a deep sleep as the aroma of coffee and\nfrying venison came to him.\n\n\nHe smiled and turned over, snuggling deeper into the frayed blanket.\n\n\nHe peered through a crack in the split bamboo wall of his shack and\nsaw that it was still dark.\n\n\nAnyway, he thought,  Gene will wake me up in time  .\n\n\nIn a few minutes, his breathing became regular again. \n\n \n\nGeneroso Dia, or Gene, slid another slice of the dried deer meat\ninto the frying pan and stepped back as the cooking oil spattered.\n\n\nHe glanced out of the lean-to kitchen to the east.\n\n\nOn the earthen ledge that served as cooking range, he flipped the\nfrying meat and the aroma made his mouth water.\n\n\nHe swept his eyes to check their meager breakfast: steamed rice,\nblack coffee with sugar, ripe tomatoes and fried  tapa  .\n\n\nThe fighting cock in the cage by the lean-to crowed his greetings to\nthe coming dawn as Gene speared the meat from the frying pan and brought it\ndown onto the enamel plate.\n\n\nLifting the frying pan to a corner of the ledge, he wiped his hands\non the back of his shorts and scooped a handful of peeled corn from a sack\nnear the stacked firewood, tossing the feed between the bamboo strips of the\nrooster 's cage.\n\n\nHe pivoted to the bamboo outer shelf and gathered the tableware\nneeded, plunking these on a small table by the steps that led to the upper\nlevel of their shack. \n\n \n\nWith a wooden spoon, he rapped on the split bamboo wall.\n\n\n \" I don't want to be late for the trip.\n\n\nCome on,  Tay   ! &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\nAbel grunted a reply, slipped out of the mosquito net, and\njackknifed into a sitting position.\n\n\nHe smiled at his son standing below with a wooden spoon, glaring at\nhim in mock anger. \n\n \n\n \" Good morning, Gene. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Good morning,  Tay  .\n\n\nC 'mon, I 'll just feed the hogs and the chickens, then I 'll be with\nyou. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nAbel moved fast once awake.\n\n\nHe crumpled the mosquito net into a ball, then rolled it with the\nfrayed blanket and the pillow with the reed mat.\n\n\nHe shoved these into a corner of the shack and slipped down to the\nkitchen.\n\n\nHe stepped outside just as a small arc of the sun crested the ridge\nof the mountain.\n\n\nHe splashed water on his face and snorted with pleasure as the cold\nspring water removed the last cobwebs of sleep out of his mind, then he\nrubbed his face with a common towel from the bamboo rack above the clay jar\nthat held the water. \n\n \n\nIn the kitchen he reached for two enamel mugs and dipped them\ninto the huge kettle of boiling coffee, placing these on the table.\n\n\nHe opened a jar of sugar, spooned out the last of the foraging ants\nand with the same spoon took out a generous portion for each mug and stirred\neach one of them.\n\n\nSeated, he started sipping his coffee. \n\n \n\n \" God is merciful, &rdquo;  he muttered as\nthe hot liquid spread warmth down his throat and side wards to his arms and\nlegs. \n\n \n\n \" Amen to that,  Tay  , &rdquo;\n intoned Gene as he came in. \n\n \n\nGene sat across his father and reached for his coffee mug.\n\n\nThe hot liquid made him shudder.\n\n\nPutting down the mug, he transferred a good portion of the newly\ncooked rice from the pot to his plate, and speared a slice of the fried\nvenison and a ripe tomato. \n\n \n\nAbel duplicated the movements of his son and the two tackled\ntheir breakfast in silence.\n\n\nAfterwards, they took their second mugs of coffee into the clearing\nin front of their shack. \n\n \n\nFather and son watched in silence as the sun crested the mountain\nridge and slowly spread light in the heavily forested area that sloped away\nto the Ragay Gulf.\n\n\nTheir shack was situated at the foot of a high bluff with its sheer\nface to the east.\n\n\nTheir front yard rolled gently to the Kambal River which meandered in\nthe forested area below them and debouched into the sea.\n\n\nIt was in the forested semi-valley to their front that Abel derived\nhis little income--the gathering of minor forest products, from  \nalmaciga   to wild honey, bananas and an occasional deer or wild\nboar. \n\n \n\nBy roaming the forests and doing occasional   kaingin\n   farming, Abel was able to send his\nonly son through secondary school.\n\n\nThey lived alone, for he had lost his wife at childbirth.\n\n\nNo lowlander girl would accept a hand-to-mouth existence with him.\n\n\nThe peculiar terrain of his part of Ragay divided the people into\nlowlanders and uplanders.\n\n\nThey who lived by the sea earned their living as fishermen and\nfarmers, while those in the uplands, as   kaingin  \nfarmers and hunters.\n\n\nIntercourse was limited to market days when both converged in the\npublic square and bought each other 's wares and products. \n\n \n\nBut Abel was content with his life, for he was by nature a loner\nand seldom made friends.\n\n\nHis immediate neighbor who lived some five kilometers from him in a\n cogon  - thatched hut more miserable than his was a\nNegrito named Iklim. \n\n \n\nIklim had also lost his wife to childbed fever after giving birth\nto a son, Nog-nog.\n\n\nDuring full moon, Iklim and Nog-nog would just show up at the Dia 's\nplace with a bunch of ripe bananas, a freshly killed deer or wild boar.\n\n\nAbel would then add more rice to his cooking pot, roast, fry or grill\nthe fresh meat and they would have a feast.\n\n\nAfterwards, Iklim and Nog-nog would creep to a corner of the shack to\nlie down and sleep.\n\n\nTheir friendship involved a minimum exchange of words. \n\n \n\nIf Gene happened to be home, the two boys, only two years\ndifference in age, would seek their own corner and talk of things important\nto boys of their age.\n\n\nGene took extra pains to increment his friend 's schooling.\n\n\nNog-nog had been able to finish only Grade Six in the lowland\nelementary school.\n\n\nThis was not for reasons of dullness, but rather he just had enough\nof the persecution by his classmates.\n\n\nShort, his complexion the color of bituminous coal, and hair like\nsteelwool, Nog-nog was always the butt of jokes and pranks.\n\n\nTo avoid complications, he just stopped going to school.\n\n\nHe was a bright boy and easily assimilated whatever Gene imparted to\nhim.\n\n\nIn return, he taught Gene woodcraft, from hunting with bow and arrow,\nto setting traps for wild boar.\n\n\nNog-nog dubbed Gene the Uplander Nog-nog, while Gene called him\nBrother.\n\n\nGene became so adept in woodcraft that he could cross a bamboo\nthicket with nary a rustle or a snapped twig; he could drive an arrow through\na medium-sized deer. \n\n \n\nThe families of Abel and Iklim were close beyond the ties of\nblood and marriage and they were content and happy. \n\n \n\nAbel broke the silence just as the sun touched them.\n\n\n \" So, Gene, today is the day.\n\n\nFrom Ragay you will be reporting to the Army Depot in Naga.\n\n\nThen what? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nGene looked at a scrawny chicken scratching the earth at his\nfeet, then answered,  \" Perhaps, to Manila,  Tay  .\n\n\nI 'm not so sure.\n\n\nI 'll write, don't you worry.\n\n\nMy induction papers are there in that box with your papers that cover\nthis small piece of land and the papers of our family.\n\n\nRemember, whatever happens, makes sure that that box stays with you,\n Tay  .\n\n\nOkay? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Yes, my son.\n\n\nAnd better wrap up what 's left of our breakfast.\n\n\nNog-nog is sure to be at the bend of the trail by the spring.\n\n\nAnd I 'm sure that Nog-nog skipped breakfast just to be able to bid\nyou goodbye.\n\n\nLet 's go, son. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nGene spotted his friend by the spring and waved. \n\n \n\nNog-nog sprang up, sprinted up the trail, embraced Gene, then\nbowed his head before Abel, asking for the blessing of the old man. \n\n \n\nAbel placed his gnarled hand on top of the kinky hair and said,\n \" God bless you, my boy. &rdquo; \n\n\nTurning to his son, he said,  \" Gene, I think a drink of\ncold spring water will do us good. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Yes,  Tay  , &rdquo; \nanswered Gene and looked at his friend.\n\n\n \" Nog-nog, please prepare a place where  Tay\n can stretch his legs. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nArm in arm, the two scurried down the trail and reached the\nspring, a good five minutes before the old man. \n\n \n\nGene eased down his  tampipi   on the ground and hunkered down beside it. \n\n \n\nMeanwhile, Nog-nog had cleared a space beside him and placed two\nbamboo tumblers full of cold spring water.\n\n\nApparently satisfied with his preparation, Nog-nog squatted beside\nGene and looked at his friend.\n\n\n \" When do we see each other again, Gene? &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\n \" I don't know.\n\n\nThey said when we were called that the cadre training would be for\nsix months.\n\n\nSome say that it will be for three months only as the government does\nnot have enough money to train us for an extended period.\n\n\nI will know for sure when I get to the Naga Depot. &rdquo; \n\n\n \n\n \" Nog-nog, &rdquo;  Abel hailed as he\nneared them,  \" come here and help me with my  tampipi\n  . &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Yes,  Ta  Bel. &rdquo; \n\n\nThe Negrito rose and hurried to assist the old man.\n\n\nThey went down the trail, Abel leaning on the shoulder of the\nNegrito, his breath coming in rasps. \n\n \n\nThe old man leaned gratefully against the bole of the tree stump\nand sighed.\n\n\nPulling the rattan pouch he was carrying closer, he opened the\nbasket and lifted out the banana-leaf-wrapped food package and placed it on\nthe ground beside him. \n\n \n\n \" Nog-nog, come here and pull your brother with\nyou.\n\n\nI want you to eat breakfast as we rest my son. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThe Negrito did not wait for a second invitation as his stomach\nhad been grumbling since the crack of dawn.\n\n\nHe had slipped out of their shack while his father was still asleep\nto make sure he was by the trail when they passed. \n\n \n\n \" Come, Gene.\n\n\n Ta  Bel will get mad and might whack me again.\n\n\nBesides, I 'm hungry. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nGene obliged his friend and they moved.\n\n\nHe reached for the tumbler and drank deep.\n\n\nThe cold water, tasting slightly of bamboo, revived him and he\nleaned back against an outcrop of stone beside his father. \n\n \n\nNog-nog made straight for the food and squatted down.\n\n\nWith a shy smile at the old man and his friend, the Negrito\ncommenced eating. \n\n \n\nGene smiled approvingly. \n\n \n\nNog-nog finished the food and belched.\n\n\nStretching up, he went to the spring and lowered his face into the\nshallow pool.\n\n\nKinky hair dripping wet, he wiped his face with the sleeve of his\nragged shirt.\n\n\nThen he unclasped something from around his neck and sat beside\nGene. \n\n \n\n \" My brother, I want you to wear this around your\nneck from now on.\n\n\nPlease.\n\n\nI know that someday it will save your life.\n\n\nIn a tight situation, try to reach the mountains where my people\nare.\n\n\nWhen you wear this, it will make you one of us.\n\n\nYou cannot be denied.\n\n\nI 'll be here for you when you come home.\n\n\nIn the meantime, I promise that I will look out for your father.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nGene looked at the object his friend had given him.\n\n\nThreaded through a length of cured deer-gut was a piece of hardwood,\ncoin-like in shape, with indentions on both sides.\n\n\nTry as he would, he couldn't make out what the indentions were.\n\n\nHe slipped it over his head and around his neck.\n\n\nHiding it in the folds of his shirt collar, he looked at his friend\nand smiled.\n\n\n \" Thank you, Nog-nog, my brother.\n\n\nThank you. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nGene stood up.\n\n\nHis father did the same.\n\n\n  Tampipi   clasped in his left arm, Gene\nproferred his right hand to Nog-nog.\n\n\n \" Goodbye, my brother.\n\n\nPlease take care of  Tay  . &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nNog-nog grasped the proffered hand, clasped it with a firm grip,\nthen he embraced Gene with his left. \n\n \n\n \" Come home, my brother.\n\n\nWe 'll be waiting for you. &rdquo; \n\n\nThe Negrito scuttled up the trail, paused, pivoted and ran after\nthem.\n\n\n \"  Ta  Bel!  Ta  Bel!\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nAbel heard the faint cry and stopped.\n\n\n \" He 's forgotten something and I think I know what it\nis, &rdquo;  he said to his son. \n\n \n\n \"  Ta  Bel, can. .... can you\nremember to buy my father some. ...  kati  . ...  kati  .\"\n \n\n \n\n\" Yes, Nog-nog, I will.\n\n\nNow go straight home.\n\n\nYour  Tatay   is waiting. &rdquo;\n\n\nAbel grinned at his son.\n\n\n \" He means   Katialis    . ...\n\n\nHe is sure to get a whacking from Iklim if I come back without it.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThe railroad station when they arrived was bedlam.\n\n\nGene and his father picked their way over bundles and packs and\ngroups of families hunkered down on the station platform.\n\n\nThey smiled and greeted acquaintances.\n\n\nMore than once, Gene felt a sharp slap in a leg as a friend or\nclassmate gave him an appropriate greeting. \n\n \n\nGene presented himself to a Philippine Army sergeant who was\nstanding importantly near the ticket booth with a clipboard.\n\n\n \" Name? &rdquo;  rasped the khaki-clad,\nputtied NCO. \n\n \n\n \" Generoso Dia, Sarge, &rdquo;  answered\nGene. \n\n \n\n \" Hmm. ...Detera. ...Dia, yes, &rdquo; \nthe NCO made a cross with his Scripto pencil and tore off a ticket from the\nroll he had wrapped around his left wrist. \n\n \n\n \" Here, don't lose it or you 'll be shovelling\nrice until Christmas in the kitchen. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Thank you, Sarge, &rdquo;  Gene grinned\nand went to a corner of the platform with his father. \n\n \n\nAbel looked at his son with sad eyes.\n\n\n \" We 'd better say our goodbyes now, Gene, while there 's\ntime. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" I 'll write you as soon as possible.\n\n\nTake care of yourself,  Tay  .\n\n\nAnd don't worry.\n\n\nI 'll come home. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Gene, my son, be a good soldier and never forget\nto pray to God.\n\n\nYou 're the only one I have.\n\n\nTake care. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nAbel placed his hand on his son 's head and murmured his\nblessing. \n\n \n\n \" Good morning,  Tata  Abel, Gene,\n&rdquo;  a familiar voice greeted them as Abel Dia intoned \"\nAmen \" . \n\n \n\nBoth looked up to find Mr. Ongkiko smiling, hand extended. \n\n \n\n \" Sir, good morning, &rdquo;  Gene greeted\nhis high school teacher heartily. \n\n \n\n \" Good morning, Mr. Ongkiko, &rdquo;  Abel\nsaid gravely. \n\n \n\n \" You on this trip, Gene? &rdquo;  asked\nMr. Ongkiko as he lighted a cigarette. \n\n \n\n \" Yes, sir, &rdquo;  answered Gene.\n \" Going to Naga? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Yes, to Naga and the Army Depot.\n\n\nI received my mobilization papers three days ago.\n\n\nJust cleared myself with our principal, bade my fianc\u00e9e\ngoodbye, asked for the blessings of my parents and here I am, &rdquo;\nanswered the teacher and now braced up.\n\n\n \" Third Lieutenant Zobel Ongkiko reporting for duty as\nordered. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" We might as well stick together, sir, I 'm on my\nway there, too, &rdquo;  said Gene. \n\n \n\n \" Let 's.\n\n\nIf you will excuse me, I will get my ticket from the Sarge over\nthere. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Gene, &rdquo;  Abel called his son as\nMr. Ongkiko walked away,  \" I 'd better say goodbye now. &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\nGene and his father embraced.\n\n\nGene could feel the beating of his father 's heart as he held him\ntight.\n\n\nHe blinked his eyes as the tears flowed.\n\n\n \" Goodbye,  Tay  . &rdquo;", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "2361d50d-bf94-4985-bafd-012cd66309c6", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.351028+00:00"}
{"text": "Chapter 24  \n\n\n  The Funeral  \n\n \n\nTHE MORTICIAN complained that he had the most difficult time\nmaking Gil Alvarez 's face presentable for viewing.\n\n\nGil 's face had three bullet holes.\n\n\nThe pale mortician related how he tried wrapping a handkerchief around\nGil 's neck and pulling it up to cover the blown-off jaw.\n\n\nHe combed Alvarez 's hair over the bullet hole on the forehead.\n\n\nBut he couldn't do a thing about the neat little bullet hole in the\ncheek.\n\n\nHe tried bandaging Alvarez 's face, but that made him look like a\nmummy displayed in some cheap carnival.\n\n\nBesides, it only called more attention to the fact that the poor\nGovernor 's face was riddled with holes.\n\n\nIn sheer desperation, the mortician had even tried putting a flower\ninto the hole in the cheek, which covered the hole all right, but a gardenia\nsitting in the middle of a man 's face was disconcerting to say the very\nleast.\n\n\nFinally, he threw his hands up in the air, sighed,  \"\n  Bahala na!   - - What the hell-- &rdquo; \nand applied makeup and powder on Alvarez 's face.\n\n\nHe covered up the holes in the neck and forehead as he had planned,\nand left the hole in the cheek exposed.\n\n\nGil Alvarez appeared that way in his open casket that sat in the\nmiddle aisle of San Antonio church. \n\n \n\nTo symbolize Gil Alvarez 's spilled blood, the Virgins had said\nthey would decorate the church in red and white.\n\n\nThey discussed what sort of flowers they would use on the altar,\nalong the aisle, and on the church pillars.\n\n\nSo caught up were they with the arrangements--a job they were often\ncalled upon to do--that they completely forgot they could not order roses,\ndahlias, daisies, chrysanthemums from distant Baguio.\n\n\nThey scoured the town and came up with white gardenias and ferns, but\nit was impossible to find red flowers.\n\n\nStuck with what Taytayan had to offer, which wasn't very much, the\nVirgins eventually figured out a way of stripping the green portions of\n gabi  leaves so only the red part showed.\n\n\nWhile the women fluttered about installing the bouquets in the\nchurch, they talked about Cristobal.\n\n\nIt seemed, according to the scandalized Petra, that he had started\ntouching certain parts of his body.\n\n\n \" I caught him in the act, &rdquo;  she said,\nindignation dripping from each word.\n\n\n \" Fondling himself. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nMama and I were helping them and my mother paused and stared at\nPetra 's sparse hair that stuck up in different angles.\n\n\n \" If fondling himself makes that poor boy feel better,\nlet him.\n\n\nHe 's lost everything after all, &rdquo;  she said, leaving\nPetra glassy-eyed and Meding philosophical. \n\n \n\nI had seen Mama afraid; I had seen her stand up against the\nJapanese soldier in Mindanao; I had seen her force herself to put on a\ncheerful front to weather our difficulties; I had seen Mama harangue God and\nthe saints with her prayers.\n\n\nGil 's funeral shook whatever composure Mama had.\n\n\nShe wept on my father 's shoulders.\n\n\n \" It 's all gone.\n\n\nIt 's dead.\n\n\nWe 've lost it.\n\n\nIt 'll never be back again, &rdquo;  she wailed. \n\n \n\nI did not know what she meant until I heard the other women\nduring the funeral Mass.\n\n\nWomen from all over Ubec traveled through enemy territory to catch a\nlast glimpse of Gil Alvarez, the man they had adored in their teen-age years.\n\n\nCrying, they talked about how Alvarez symbolized their youth, and how\nhis death signalled the unquestionable end of the days when they laughed and\n rhumbaed  and jitter-bugged--those days along with\nAlvarez had turned into dust whipping in the dry wind, they cried.\n\n\nThey mourned for the death that happened in their souls. \n\n \n\nWhen the women saw Gil Alvarez 's face, when they saw Cristobal,\nkneeling quietly ( loaded with Meding 's pink medicine)--a carbon copy of his\nOlympiad father--Ubec 's demigod if not Ubec 's god--the women could not\ncontain their deep sorrow and rage.\n\n\nAll the sufferings they had accumulated through the war years, all\nthe humiliation they bore, and which they lifted up to God--  God 's\nWill be done  - - welled up and burst like a dam in the ancient stone\nchurch.\n\n\nThe old Spanish friar--deaf and barely with the living--had never in\nhis entire sixty years of sacerdotal activities witnessed such passion.\n\n\nFearing the women would tear the casket apart, tear Gil Alvarez apart\nfor pieces of his flesh to use in precious reliquaries, he hastened the\nfuneral Mass. \n\n \n\nLater, ten women pushed away the men who lifted Gil 's coffin,\nand they ( with black veils covering their faces) carried him all the way to\nthe cemetery, instead of using the tired black funeral car that looked like a\nworn bat and that often stalled in the middle of De Leon Avenue, anyway.\n\n\nFour women tore their hair and strewed them along the way like black\nconfetti. \n\n \n\nIt was foolish, but lurking inside of me was the hope that Gil\nwould come back to life as Doc Mendez had.\n\n\nMy intellect knew, just by the sight of the hole on his cheek, that\nhe was dead--Gil Alvarez 's corpse really looked terrible.\n\n\nBut a part of me clung to the idea that some miracle could happen.\n\n\nAll these people, all the tears, surely God would grant us another\nmiracle.\n\n\nBut beyond the excessive display of mourning, nothing unusual\noccurred.\n\n\nWhen Gil 's casket grated its way into the niche and the marble\nmarker was put in place with a dull thud, I finally accepted that there would\nbe no miracle this time.\n\n\nGil was dead.\n\n\nThis realization was punctuated by the fainting of two women. \n\n \n\nLater, spent, so thoroughly spent, the mourners gathered at the\nVirgins ' house for the funeral meal which Meding and Petra so very kindly\nprepared.\n\n\nOver the wartime extravagance of fine white rice, roast pig,\nbarbecued chickens, and fruit-of-the-gods salad, people spoke unabashedly of\nGil 's magnificence, while Cristobal locked himself in his bedroom and lay on\nthe bed, wetting himself from grief. \n\n \n\nI DETECTED a change in my father.\n\n\nWhat pained him most went beyond the loss of Gil Alvarez, and the\ntorture they endured as prisoners in Martin Lewis ' camp.\n\n\nMy father lost faith in Americans.\n\n\nHe had lived with them; he had known them and loved them.\n\n\nBut now he realized that a lot of what Gil Alvarez had said about\nAmericans was true.\n\n\nAnd my father realized ( with a shock and sadness that a baby must\nfeel when severed from his mother 's umbilical cord) that Filipinos must\nshape their destiny, that they were responsible for their future, that\nAmerica ( for all her verbal good intentions) watched out for herself and her\ncitizens first of all, even if this meant using other countries and peoples.\n\n\nAnd so he and other men continued with the guerrilla warfare with an\nintensity that had been lacking before.\n\n\nThey had always held back, waiting for MacArthur to return, waiting\nfor the Americans to liberate the Philippines.\n\n\nBut now no more.\n\n\nIf they would have to fight the Japanese for the next decade, or even\ntwenty years, then that was how it would be.\n\n\nBut they would continue fighting for Filipino freedom. \n\n \n\nI MYSELF had developed an insecurity about my father.\n\n\nI was always afraid he 'd suddenly disappear or die.\n\n\nI touched him often, hung onto his arm, and sat beside him\nconstantly.\n\n\nEven at night, I would awake with a sudden jerk, then I would go to\ntheir room and shake him awake, to prove to myself that he was alive.\n\n\nOnce I prayed to God and without thinking, said,  \"\nThank you, God, that it was Gil Alvarez who died, and not Papa. &rdquo;\n\n\n\nI paused, horrified at my words.\n\n\nAnd then I felt bad.\n\n\nDeep inside I had sensed that blood would be spilled; I had felt it.\n\n\nBut guilty as I felt, I was happy it was not my father 's blood. \n\n \n\nONE NIGHT I fell into a fitful sleep, but later I awoke to the\nsound of a rhythmic thudding.\n\n\nI felt disoriented.\n\n\nAt first I thought I was back in Ubec.\n\n\nThen I realized I was in Taytayan but I thought Papa was still\nmissing.\n\n\nI became frightened because the sound came from my parents ' room.\n\n\nHurrying to their room, I opened the door slightly.\n\n\nThe sound came from the headboard banging softly against the wall.\n\n\nMy father was on top of my mother.\n\n\nThey were making love, their eyes closed as they rocked regularly,\nlike the waves lapping the shore.\n\n\nMoonlight streamed into the room and I could see a film of sweat on\nMama 's forehead.\n\n\nHer mouth was half-open with desire, and Papa was on top of her,\nloving her with a vibrancy I had never seen before.\n\n\nHis body moved rhythmically on top of hers.\n\n\nThey throbbed with life.\n\n\nI felt a vivid sense of clarity that swept aside all sense of guilt\nand misgivings: they were alive and I was alive. \n\n\n  Chapter 25  \n\n\n  Liberation  \n\n \n\nWHILE PAPA, Gil, and Max had been prisoners of Martin Lewis, Doc\nhad taken over the guerrilla leadership.\n\n\nBeing basically a non-violent person, it had gone against his grain\nto actively participate in the fighting.\n\n\nBut he had talked it over with God, and there was no one else who\ncould head the Movement.\n\n\nHemming and hawing would have meant sure death for Papa, Gil, and\nMax; it would have meant the collapse of Ubec 's guerrilla movement and total\nJapanese control of the island, with a great loss of civilian lives.\n\n\nAnd so Doc knew that God wanted him to be Ubec 's guerrilla head.\n\n\n \" It is strange, &rdquo;  he said, \n\" how life shapes itself for you. &rdquo; \n\n\nCuriously, once he became the movement 's leader, he lost his ability\nto read people 's auras.\n\n\nHe muttered once about how this loss was  \" payment\n&rdquo;  - - for what exactly, he never did elaborate. \n\n \n\nDoc Mendez turned out to be as fine a soldier as he was a doctor.\n\n\nUnder his leadership, the  guerilleros  liberated\ntowns until three-quarters of the island of Ubec were in guerrilla hands.\n\n\nThings were going bad for the Japanese, including a major setback\nwhen Admiral Isoruku Yoshida died.\n\n\nIt was a strange circumstance--shortly after his return to the\nJapanese, Yoshida contracted cholera after carelessly eating unwashed fruit.\n\n\nPeople said, with a note of vengeance, that his death was meant to\nbe.\n\n\nThe Japanese found themselves confined to the city of Ubec, but they\nstill possessed superior arms and resisted the movement effectively.\n\n\nDoc said it would take a long time for the movement to liberate Ubec\nCity; but with the Americans and their superior arms, Ubec would be liberated\nin a matter of days.\n\n\nHis words proved correct. \n\n \n\nIN TAYTAYAN, it was quiet from the time darkness set in until\nthe sun rose.\n\n\nAt dawn, in my room the first sounds that broke the silence were the\nclip-clopping of a horse.\n\n\nIt was the old delivery man, with his fresh milk and white cheese.\n\n\nThis November morning, however, I awoke, not to the peaceful\nclip-clopping, but to the rude shattering sound of gunshots. \n\n \n\nI lifted the mosquito net, rolled to the floor and crawled under\nthe bed.\n\n\nI stared out at the rosy sunlight that filtered into the bedroom to\nfigure out what was going on.\n\n\nThere was more shooting.\n\n\nI thought to myself that the Japanese had invaded Taytayan and we\nwould all die.\n\n\nI was making the sign of the cross when I heard people 's voices and\nlaughter.\n\n\nLaughter--?\n\n\nI crept to the window and peered out.\n\n\nPeople were running up and down the sidewalk.\n\n\nThere were men and women dancing in the street, and down the road\nmarched a steady stream of American soldiers.\n\n\nThere was so much activity, so much joy.\n\n\nI stood up to wave, but I felt my stomach cramp.\n\n\nThe pain was sharp and all I could do was crawl back to bed.\n\n\nIt was then I noticed bloodstains on the bed sheet and blood on my\nnightgown.\n\n\nI had been hit by a stray bullet, and I was dying. \n\n \n\n \" Ma--Ma! &rdquo;  I shouted. \n\n \n\nMama burst into my room.\n\n\n \" What is it, Yvonne? &rdquo;  She had on her\nbest dress, the same one she had worn in Mindanao when Gil Alvarez had supper\nwith us.\n\n\nBefore I could tell her about my terminal condition, she said,\n \" Yvonne, Yvonne, they 're here!\n\n\nThe Americans are here! &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Ma, I 'm dying. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nMy mother 's Madonna eyes glinted when she spotted the blood\nstains.\n\n\nShe checked me, then smiled.\n\n\n \" You 're all right.\n\n\nIt 's just your period.\n\n\nYou 're now a woman.\n\n\nEverything 's all right.\n\n\nAnd the Americans have returned, with tanks and guns.\n\n\nIt took a long time, but the war 's over. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nWhen she later left to join the impromptu celebration in the\nstreets, I sat by the window and watched the men shoot their guns into the\nair and yell out loud profanities and prayers.\n\n\nI saw Mama and Papa, Nida and Max, Doc, Bitong, and all the others\nlaughing, shouting.\n\n\nI saw women--young and old--racing from one American soldier to\nanother, kissing the dazed Americans who were themselves overwhelmed at being\nliberators of Taytayan.\n\n\nBewildered children stood by doorways not knowing what to make of\nthis human carnival. \n\n \n\nA scene caught my eye, and I viewed this as if it were all in\nslow motion.\n\n\nThere was a young woman, around twenty years old, wearing a filmy\nwhite dress that fluttered about her.\n\n\nHer waist-length hair was braided down her back; her tanned skin\nshone like gold.\n\n\nShe was enchanting, like some creature descended from the sky.\n\n\nShe ran from soldier to soldier, handing them a flower, kissing them\non the cheeks, her movements slow and fluid.\n\n\nShe approached a lanky young American soldier, and after smiling at\nhim, she tiptoed and kissed him on the cheek.\n\n\nHe was so stunned that he stood frozen with his hand on his cheek,\nwhile he watched her disappear in the crowd. \n\n \n\nThe revelry continued for a long time and I imagined the virgins\nwatching from their balcony, clucking their tongues and predicting that there\nwould be a rash of half-American babies in Taytayan in nine months. \n\n \n\nFor that was what a woman did--she nurtured a child in her womb\nfor nine months, then released this human being into this world.\n\n\nAnd I, my mother had just said, was now a woman. \n\n \n\nI stood in front of the mirror and studied the reflection of the\nscrawny girl with bony elbows sticking out.\n\n\nWas that really I?\n\n\nHad I grown four inches since the war broke out?\n\n\nHad my round cheeks receded to reveal cheekbones that would make me\nlook like Mama one day?\n\n\nI unbuttoned my nightgown and pulled it down so my chest was\nexposed.\n\n\nThere were more ribs than breasts;

{"text": "Chapter 1 \n \n\n \n\nIt is Friday morning, Alberto is back in Zamboanga, and it has\ntaken less than three hours on a DC-3 aeroplane, an old warrior-airplane of\nSecond World War vintage converted into a commercial aeroplane.\n\n\nNot many years in the future a jet will make the flight in a few\nminutes, but then they will cut off direct flights to Zamboanga from Cotabato\nand redirect them to either Davao or Cebu for extra flights to make more\nmoney for the airline, a government monopoly, which senators and cabinet\nmembers will make into their own private milking cow, driving it to\nbankruptcy.\n\n\nAs a result, it will take half a day more and add flight mileage\nnearly equal to a direct flight to Manila, which is twice as far, to make the\nair trip that way.\n\n\nBut there are no jet flights yet, and Alberto is not thinking of this.\n\n\n \n\nWhat he is thinking is:  \" Well, who would believe me\nif I were to tell them that in less than three hours I 've been transported\nfrom a primitive and savage land to a civilized modern Christian city of the\nSouth. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nHe takes a \" P.U. \" ( so-called at that time to\nmean \" public utility car \" ) , an old Chevy, and is happy\nthat the driver recognizes him and says he used to always take passengers\nfrom the airport terminal to his family pension house before it was closed\nsome years ago.\n\n\nWithout waiting for more passengers to fill his P.U., he drives off so\nas not to delay Alberto who, says the driver, will like to see his folks\nwithout much delay.\n\n\nThe airport is not very far from his home (  Are you married,\n  'noy   ?  - -  No, I 'm not yet\nmarried. \n\n\n- -  That 's good.\n\n\nWhile you 're still young, better enjoy life.  ) , and very\nsoon after going straight down San Jose road they turn left on an asphalt\nstreet and then a minute later left again into a driveway.\n\n\nAlberto pays his fare, gives a five-peso tip.\n\n\nFor today is special.\n\n\nHe feels nostalgic, lonely, and eager to feel at home by having\npeople recognize him.\n\n\nThe P.U. car backs out since the driveway is too narrow for it to\nturn around, and that is when he hears voices, his family 's voices, and the\ncar is not even out of the gate yet when he sees them: emerging from the\nfront concrete porch, covered with a roof that leaks even in a light drizzle;\nhis mother comes out of the door first, followed by his two sisters on either\nside of her, almost hesitating as if they were some kind of a moth hanging\nabout her--and then his Papa, smiling broadly, as all other three are smiling\nnow, but his is a relaxed, confident smile, unlike his mother 's or sisters '\n, with something sad, painful even, not really spangling, shiny. \n\n \n\n \" You 've arrived,   hijo \n ! &rdquo;  says his mother. \n\n \n\n \"   Ooo   , Alberto!\n&rdquo;  his sisters say. \n\n \n\n \" Ma, &rdquo;  he says, head tilted up.\n\n\n \" Ah, Cora.\n\n\nYou, too, Pilar. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nHis father Federico does not say anything.\n\n\nHe stands at the top of the stairs, looking down, smiling broadly.\n\n\nHis mother kisses him on the cheek, awkwardly, and he kisses back, as\nthe two sisters flank him and plant their kisses awkwardly, too, on either\ncheek.\n\n\nThis kind of scene has always been awkward, a little embarrassing,\nfor the Gonzaleses were raised not to be profuse, open, with their emotions\nand feelings. \n\n \n\nAlberto starts up the stairs, his father looking down, still, and\nhe halts before him; not kissing him, or embracing, just staring back,\nsoftly, as if any physical contact between them will burn him.\n\n\nHe just says,  \" Hello, Papa, &rdquo;  - - his\neyes gushing with genuine affection, what his body cannot physically do, not\nbecause it won't, but that both know that a display of emotion means shedding\none 's manhood, one 's manliness. \n\n \n\n \"   Pues, hijo,   how\nare you? &rdquo;  asks Federico. \n\n \n\n \"   Muy bien,   Papa,\n&rdquo;  he answers.\n\n\nThe two sisters tug at his traveling bag.\n\n\n \" It 's all right, Cora, Pilar.\n\n\nI can carry it myself. &rdquo; \n\n\nBut his sisters insist, and he lets go of the bag and a package of\ndried mudfish.\n\n\nThe two walk ahead of them, crossing the floor towards his old room,\nright, at the other end of the   sala    . \n\n \n\n \" You did not tell us you were arriving today,\n&rdquo;  says his mother, Emma.\n\n\n \" We could have met you at the airport. &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\n \" I received your telegram last Saturday, Mama,\n&rdquo;  he says.\n\n\n \" I left immediately for Cotabato the next day after\nsleeping in Pikit.\n\n\nThere 's no telegraph office there. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThe three of them sit in the   sala  \n, Alberto on the old couch with a backrest like the streamlined tail of a\n1950s Oldsmobile.\n\n\nHow many times had he sat here, in the middle of the night or\ntwo-three hours before daybreak, soused, stinking of   tuba \n  ? - -   ay   , in a\nvery different situation--while his mother gave him a sermon for being drunk\nand going out with the uncultured, impoverished gang from San Jose, a small\ncity-village just across the street from their own. \n\n \n\nHe remembers one incident well, about five years ago: they had\nrushed out of the Red Cross Garden--Mon, Ben and he--in their hands either a\nchain, brass knuckles, or \" \" Rosita &rdquo; \" ( a\nfavorite weapon of the gang: a round lead, like a bob, tied at the end of a\nhandkerchief that one swings at an enemy just like the old knights did with\ntheir ball-and-chain weapons.\n\n\nIt is so-called because anyone conked on the head with it goes into a\n\" sweet &rdquo; sleep, knocked out of this world as one who has been\nkissed by Rosita, a beautiful bar girl the gang unanimously elected, in\namusement and without the girl 's consent or knowledge, as their muse),\nchasing four or five members of the  Mundo Escurro  gang\nof Baliwasan.\n\n\nThe men and women who were watching the door for gatecrashers to the\npublic benefit dance ( the local Red Cross was raising calamity funds) fell\naway, terror in their eyes, the women screaming and some crying.\n\n\nSoused and reeling with drunkenness, Alberto had thought one of the\n Mundo Escurro  gang members had fled to the right side of\nthe open-air, concrete dance floor.\n\n\nSwinging his \" Rosita \" over his head, bleary-eyed,\nthe faces and shapes of people seeming all behind a fog or cloud, he cornered\na young man against a wall.\n\n\n \" Ha-ha, &rdquo;  he shouted, threatening the\nman with his \" Rosita \" .\n\n\n \" I 'm going to spill your brains out on the floor,\ntough guy! &rdquo; \n\n\nThe fog or mist of drunkenness began to clear as he came up against\nthe young man, and he saw young girls cowering beside a boy of not more than\n16 who, definitely, was not a  Mundo Escurro  .\n\n\nFrom their eyes, oohed-lips, even from the invisible sweat of their\nbodies, gushed pure terror, fright, silent scream: he, Alberto, was the sole\ncause, the final reason, and he felt great, chest-swelling, and mocked the\nyoung boy as if to spill his brains out to assure himself that indeed it was\nhe that the young girls and the boy were so afraid of.\n\n\nThen he spun toward the door, a small group of women facing away from\nhis path and bunching together against a wall, trembling, some whimpering,\nand ran out to the unlit asphalted street.\n\n\nThere were young boys and girls there, who had run outside during the\nruckus, milling about, and Alberto, too drunk to see clearly under the\nmoonless night and the few colored lights of the Red Cross Garden, could not\nmake out whether the men in front or at his back were his gang or the\n Mundo Escurro  gang or just couples who had come to the\nRed Cross benefit dance.\n\n\nSo, blindly, reeking with   tuba   he and his\ngang had drunk earlier at the pier, a nook for chiselers, pickpockets,\ndrunks, the dregs of the town, he cut across the street toward the wide\nplayground bordered with  acacia  trees, just behind one\nof the brick-and-plaster buildings of the old Petit barracks, former\nheadquarters of the U.S. Army Occupation Forces, over half a century ago, now\nhousing the city 's public library.\n\n\nAt the fringe of the playground, which would show patches of dry dead\ngrass like bald spots on a man 's head in the daytime, which now were\ninvisible in the dark, the dry patches being felt then under one 's foot by\nthe abrupt, smooth slump in the lawn, Alberto 's eyes fell on an empty\nplayground; its immediate lawn from where he and others stood lit from the\nRed Cross Garden 's lights, the part from its edge to some 20 meters in half\nlight, and beyond it, that is, among the old, run-down brick-and-plaster\nbuildings and under the  acacia  trees bordering the\nplayground, was in complete darkness.\n\n\nNot a soul moved in the huge playground, so it seemed, and, at the\nmoment, he was puzzled, confused, that nearly all who had rushed out from the\ngarden 's social hall during the ruckus, or left it when the benefit dance\nwas stopped, were standing at the edge of the playground, forming a half-moon\naround it and looking out beyond at something which Alberto could not yet\nsee, though he felt its presence.\n\n\nThen he saw it, or thought he saw two flitting objects in a kind of\nmacabre chase, running from one end of the playground to the other, and back,\nbefore the barracks buildings, because the next moment the two objects were\ngone, swallowed as it were by the darkness.\n\n\nIndeed, there was nothing there now but darkness.\n\n\nBut the crowd kept looking toward those empty barracks buildings,\ncertainly not for the ghosts of American soldiers who had occupied them until\nthe Japanese forces overran the Petit barracks; it was as if they had\nanticipated it, if not a part of their unspoken scheme, that the two figures\nwould again appear out of the dark and, indeed, again, the two emerged into\nthe half light in a macabre chase, this and that way.\n\n\nThen he saw it again.\n\n\nHowever, he was not with the crowd in anticipation, or in their\nunspoken scheme, many of whom had fled when he and his gang chased the\n Mundo Escurros  .\n\n\nHe was too drunk even to think, much more speculate on the appearance\nof the two fighters who, from the fringe of the lawn, he could still guess\nwas Ben, the tallest in their gang, though both young men were tall.\n\n\nThen he knew for sure it was Ben and a  Mundo Escurro\n , because two young men stepped out of the edge of the crowd,\nright, not more than two meters from him, onto the lawn. \n\n \n\nOne said,  \" Let 's help Rudy. &rdquo; \n\n\n- -   Oo   , &rdquo;  said\nthe other, moving up front.\n\n\n \" I 'll be the one to hit him.\n\n\nYou go that way, &rdquo;  he said, pointing to the other side\nof the playground,  \" and get behind him. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nNow the two  Mundo Escurros  started to cut\nacross the playground toward the other side, where Ben and the \nMundo Escurro  gang member were fighting.\n\n\nMoving quietly behind the two  Mundo Escurros  ,\nAlberto said,  \"   Oy   , you!\n\n\nStay where you are!\n\n\nLet the two of them fight by themselves. &rdquo; \n\n\nThe one on the left, nearest to Alberto, turned his head halfway over\nhis shoulder, while the other went on, his initial momentum when he decided\nto assist his gangmate sort of driving him onward.\n\n\nAlthough the two  Mundo Escurros  never really\nseparated at great length because the first man had not stopped moving\nforward.\n\n\n \"   Hoy   , I 'm warning you,\n  rayo    ! &rdquo; \nAlberto hissed.\n\n\nHe could barely see the two young men in the half darkness, blurred\nobjects through a mist of drunkenness which hung over his head.\n\n\nHe had pulled out his \" Rosita \" and was swinging\nthe head-ball over his head as a warning, when the second man fell and he saw\nMon, the \" \" man-of-bones &rdquo; \" ( so-called\nbecause he was very thin but strong), standing over the fallen \nMundo Escurro  , kicking him relentlessly with his huge boots,\nwhich were spiked with horseshoes, in his ribs and face.\n\n\nWhen Mon would be kicking someone with his boots, he sort of became\npossessed and a little deranged.\n\n\nThe act of kicking a man, an enemy, with horseshoe-spiked boots, took\nover his mind, his good nature, and the only way to stop him was to literally\ncarry him off or wait until he had spent his energy.\n\n\nThe latter was preferred by their gang, because Mon often turned his\nanger, madness, against the one who was stopping him.\n\n\nThere was no way the second  Mundo Escurro  would\nget up again, not with Mon on top of him and busting his ribs with his heavy\nboots.\n\n\nHe would not stop until the young man had ceased to move or until he\nwas unconscious. \n\n \n\nMeanwhile, the first young man was about to become a problem,\nsomeone that must be stopped before whatever plans, sinister, would goad his\nbody to uncontrolled action.\n\n\nAlberto had wavered about hitting him immediately with his \"\nRosita \" , and in that instant the  Mundo Escurro\n lunged at him with something glittering in his right hand.\n\n\n \" He has a knife! &rdquo;  thought Alberto, the\nrealization jolting him and reaching his   tuba   -\nnumbed mind.\n\n\n   \" Cono su puta madre! &rdquo; \n \n\n\nInstinctively, he swung and felt the lead-ball sink in the man 's\nspinal column.\n\n\nThrough blurred eyes, with the mist of drunkenness still hovering\nover his head, Alberto saw the young man abruptly stop, turn immobile and\nfreeze like a statue, in the infinitesimal second the \" Rosita\n\" struck him.\n\n\nHe threatened him with his \" Rosita \" again,\nswinging the deadly weapon over his head, while saying, hissing at the young\nman,  \" You stay where you are,  ha  !\n\n\nLet them fight fair.\n\n\nLeave them alone, or I 'll hit you with my \" Rosita\n\" again! &rdquo; \n\n\nHe did not realize that the  Mundo Escurro  gang\nmember was paralyzed and could not move, not even a finger, even if his life\ndepended on it.\n\n\nBoth feet stayed in the same position: one forward as when he lunged\nat Alberto and the other stretched behind him, with only a slight bend, and\nhis back curved in a terribly twisted sharp arc, a hand twisted back to touch\nthe spot where the \" Rosita \" had struck hard and was\narrested by the weapon just before it could soothe or reach the stricken spot\nwhich swelled into a bump, what folks call   ratoncitos \n , or tiny \" mice, &rdquo; on his back.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6514e8c8-8cd1-4ac4-a542-b3db28d0ac4a", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.353940+00:00"}
{"text": "The Deadliest Tari  \n\n\n Antonio A. Hidalgo \n\n \n\nNestor Divinagracia will never cease to surprise me.\n\n\nHe follows a different drummer from everyone else, a unique rhythm in\nhis inner mind which tells him when to twist and when to turn as he wends his\nway along life 's road.\n\n\nI follow a more ordinary beat, which prevents me from anticipating\nNestor 's directions.\n\n\nThe result is that I lose money when Nestor loses, and also when\nNestor wins, in his complicated schemes to invent a surefire winning approach\nto cockfighting. \n\n \n\nIt could be because Nestor comes from a much richer family and,\nfreed from having to worry about supporting himself and his family, his\nmotivations are entirely different from mine.\n\n\nOr perhaps his superior intelligence and wide reading make his thought\nprocesses incomprehensible to me. \n\n \n\nWhatever.\n\n\nHe blew my mind once again by visiting me in my house without warning\nlate one night.\n\n\nI was watching TV with my wife and young daughter in the bedroom and\nstepped out to the  sala  to behold an apparition from the\npast.\n\n\nThe old Nestor sat on the sofa,  sans  sandals,\nearring, ponytail, and shabby hippie clothes.\n\n\nHe was neatly dressed in expensive imported Dockers tan slacks, Marks\nand Spencer ruby shirt, and light-brown Bally shoes.\n\n\nHis thick hair was cut short once more and slicked straight back.\n\n\nHe greeted me formally with a straightforward demeanor. \n\n \n\nIt was obvious that Nestor had gotten over the mid-life crisis\nthat had caused him to divorce his wife, become a ' 60s hippie called \nKapitan Kidlat   , and turn to magical\ncockfighting despite his advanced degree in biology.\n\n\nHe was now once more the rich, sophisticated scientist who had taught\nme all I knew about cockfighting. \n\n \n\nIn quick, clipped tones, he informed me that he had met this\nunusual girl, Katrina Vandenberg, while exploring the Buddhist temples of\nSouth Korea.\n\n\nShe was visiting her Dutch father, a diplomat, and Filipina mother in\nSeoul while on vacation from her job with the Renault car company in Paris.\n\n\nShe was an engineering graduate of the French Polytechnic, the finest\ntechnical school in Europe and spoke French, German, English, and Filipino\nfluently. \n\n \n\nShe had become fascinated with our slasher style of cockfighting\nduring her visits to the Philippines and had become quite an expert cocker\nthrough intensive reading and total immersion in our cockpits for brief\nperiods.\n\n\nThey had talked for days about their common passion and fallen in\nlove.\n\n\nNestor had married her in Seoul and they had just settled in his\nhouse in San Lorenzo Village in Makati, which he had previously been renting\nout.\n\n\nHe wanted Abet and me to visit and meet his new wife. \n\n \n\nAbet and I, with our wives, had dinner with the newlyweds a few\ndays later.\n\n\nKatrina was a most charming hostess.\n\n\nThe food, though, was very European, rather heavy with meats, and the\nwines that accompanied every dish were unfamiliar to us.\n\n\nI was greatly relieved when, after dinner, Katrina invited our wives\nto chat in the  lanai  and Nestor took Abet and me to the\nliving room to drink some 15-year-old J & B whiskey and to shoot the bull.\n\n\n \n\nNestor outlined his latest cockfighting scheme.\n\n\nHe had abandoned magical cocking and was back to the scientific\nbreeding of four trios which he had recently imported from Ray Alexander and\nJerry Douglas in the States.\n\n\nHe had also acquired a couple of dozen Bacolod aces to enter in the\nbigtime derbies.\n\n\nBut this was not the scheme; the gamefowl were just the means for\ntesting a new slasher knife which he and Katrina had invented and produced.\n\n\n \n\nOur host opened the antique carved Chinese chest which served as\nour coffee table and retrieved a small attach\u00e9 case which contained\nhis   taris   .\n\n\nHe took one out and we examined it in detail.\n\n\nIt was shaped like a   kris   , the sword\nused by Muslim warriors in Mindanao.\n\n\nThe wavy pattern, however, was only in the sharp edge of the knife;\nthe bottom edge was the same as in other slasher knives.\n\n\nThere were two canals cut into both sides to allow the blood of the\ncock that was hit to spurt out.\n\n\nIt had a kind of arrowhead design at the tip, to maximize its ripping\naction when withdrawn. \n\n \n\nIt looked deadly, but Abet and I did not know enough about\nslasher knives to determine whether it worked.\n\n\nNestor assured us that it would prove to be the deadliest weapon in\ncockfighting as it was designed according to his and Katrina 's formidable\nknowledge of the mechanics of how a gamecock delivers its blows.\n\n\nIt was produced from the finest European steel alloy and on precise\nEuropean machines brought in by Katrina according to the exacting standards\nlearned by her at the Polytechnic.\n\n\nAnd it would be tested in a six-cock derby at the Roligon cockpit the\nfollowing Monday and Wednesday. \n\n \n\nIt became obvious on our way home to Cainta that our wives had\nbeen enthralled by the young, beautiful, and brown-haired Katrina.\n\n\nThey were attracted by her European sophistication and were\ncaptivated by her stories of life abroad.\n\n\nWe were relieved to discover that Katrina had already sold them on\nthe idea of testing a new   tari   in Roligon.\n\n\nFor a change, it was our wives who eagerly offered to pinch some\nmoney from their household budgets to bet on Nestor 's cocks.\n\n\nWith silent laughter in our hearts, Abet and I agreed to their\nsuggestions that we altogether put up a quarter of the 20,000 peso pot money\nand bet 3,000 on the first cock, doubling the amount with every win. \n\n \n\nThe Roligon derby 's elimination round on Monday night had a full\nhouse.\n\n\nThere were 98 entries and the champion 's prize reached more than 1.2\nmillion pesos.\n\n\nOur wives insisted on coming with us, and had bought new dresses and\nhad had their hair done for the occasion.\n\n\nLike all beginners in cockfighting, they were absolutely certain that\nthe championship belonged to us.\n\n\nI must admit that Abet and I were also excited by the prospect of\nwinning a quarter of the championship purse, which was 300 thousand pesos.\n\n\n \n\nThe first fight of our entry, which Nestor had named \n Kris   , was called at nine p.m.\n\n\nWe rushed to join Nestor and Katrina in their cockhouse.\n\n\nThe cock was already in a small limbering cage, being warmed up by\nNestor through teasing it with a catchcock.\n\n\nIt was an impressively tall gray with long silver hackles, refined\ngreen shanks and toes, and a tail so long that its streamers had been cut to\nkeep them from reaching the ground.\n\n\nThe cock was obviously alert and extremely aggressive; it tried to\nstrike the catchcock twice and only Nestor 's quick reflexes kept the gray\nfrom fighting before its appointed time.\n\n\nAbet and I were explaining to our wives the especially fine points of\nthe gray when the cockpit runner arrived to tell us to heel the knife on our\ncock. \n\n \n\nNestor performed the elaborate ritual of tying on the slasher.\n\n\nHe wound the cotton padding around the cock 's left spur with deft\nmotions and carefully adjusted it so that it would provide a firm base with a\nperfect trajectory for the knife.\n\n\nNestor took his miniature   kris   ,\npressed its forked base firmly onto the padding, and precisely aligned it\nwith the cock 's breastbone, prop toe, and asshole.\n\n\nWe did not stay to watch him secure the knife with endless loops of\nwaxed string and electrical tape and, later, to fasten the sheath.\n\n\nWe hurried back to our ringside seats, worried that the overflowing\ncrowd may have grabbed them. \n\n \n\nPride welled up in us when Nestor entered the pit with the\nthoroughbred gray.\n\n\nHe let the gray loose for a couple of minutes: it goose-stepped\nslowly around the ring with a measured rhythm, stopped often to heartily crow\nits challenge to the world, and went back to Nestor to be picked up.\n\n\nThe impressive display made the gray a favorite and the odds were ten\nto eight in our favor by the time Nestor 's handler started to enrage the\ngray by making the catchcock peck it repeatedly in the ears. \n\n \n\nThe gray rose six feet in the air during the first buckle and\ndrove its knife deep into its red opponent 's chest.\n\n\nThe red collapsed and our cock quickly killed it on the ground with a\nmurderous shuffle.\n\n\nThe crowd clapped at the awesome display of ferocity, strength, and\naccuracy of the gray. \n\n \n\nNestor broke out a bottle of Remy Martin VSOP cognac to cap our\njubilation in the cockhouse.\n\n\nThe gray was unhurt and was put back into its holding stall.\n\n\nNestor and I went to see the damage the new knife had inflicted on\nthe gray 's opponent.\n\n\nIt was a sickening sight: the red 's chest had been torn apart and we\ncould see part of its stilled heart and ripped lungs through the monstrous\nwound; its right leg was nearly severed at the hip from the ground shuffle.\n\n\nI was awed by the terrible damage wrought by Nestor 's invention.\n\n\n \n\nNews of the deadly   tari   spread\nquickly through the crowd and our next fight was delayed by a protest lodged\nby the opposing entry against our unconventional weapon.\n\n\nThe cockpit owner inspected the   tari  \nhimself and ruled it legal because it had the same dimensions as the opponent 's\nknife.\n\n\nIt helped a lot that Nestor and the owner had been classmates at the\nAteneo in their youth. \n\n \n\nWe were heavy favorites in our second fight, and rightly so, for\nit ended as quickly as the first one.\n\n\nOur second gray cock, a full brother to the first, got its white\nopponent on the first fly with a billhold and drove it to the ground with an\nair-borne shuffle.\n\n\nOur cock didn't let go of its billhold and never stopped hitting: the\nreferee had to forcibly pull it away when he was certain the white cock was\nstone dead.\n\n\nAgain, the crowd clapped. \n\n \n\nThe usual hangers-on milled about the cockhouse, greedily\nimbibing the winning vibrations from the   Kris  \nentry that had just topped the elimination round with perfection.\n\n\nNestor and Katrina were animatedly discussing the finer points of\ntheir knife with their backs turned to the crowd, so as not to reveal their\nsecret.\n\n\nWe drank some  cognac  for a while with our wives,\nbut had to leave shortly, as Abet and I had to report for work early that\nmorning. \n\n \n\nWe may as well not have gone to work on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\n\nThe glory of Monday night lingered in our minds and we spent most of\nour time in our offices on the phone, endlessly reliving both fights and\nelevating them to myths with each recounting.\n\n\nThis made the interminable waiting for the final round of the derby\non Wednesday night a bit more bearable. \n\n \n\nWe had won nearly 6,000 pesos in the elimination round and our\nwives decided to invest a good part of it on new outfits and hairdos for the\nchampionship round.\n\n\nWe did not complain, as Abet and I had won another 4,000 pesos with\nfurtive side bets on the two grays.\n\n\nThus did we go that Wednesday night to the Roligon cockpit, our wives\ndecked out for a dinner party and Abet and I with singing hearts from our\nsecret winnings and our dreams of grabbing a share of the gigantic\nchampionship prize. \n\n \n\nThe bettors at ringside were lavish in their praise of our deadly\ncocks.\n\n\nThis spurred Abet and me to hold forth at some length on the art and\nscience of cockfighting.\n\n\nOur confidence in our expertise must have been catching, for the\nwhole second row at ringside bet on our choices for the first four fights.\n\n\nWe won all our bets. \n\n \n\nThe fifth fight was our entry and we scrambled to the cockhouse\nto lend moral support to Nestor and Katrina as they prepared the cock for\nbattle.\n\n\nThe cock was a splash red, the type that is called a  \nlasak-langawin   because the countless white flecks on its red\nand black feathers make the cock look like hundreds of flies have descended\non it.\n\n\nIt was another magnificent Bacolod cock, restlessly pacing its\nlimbering cage, wishing only to be let loose so that it could explode in\nfury. \n\n \n\nAfter the runner told us the fight was on, Nestor calmly brought\nthe   lasak   to the cockpit office to weigh it\nbefore the eagle-eyed opposing entry and the derby managers.\n\n\nThen he heeled the cock and pushed his way through the crowd to the\npit.\n\n\nWe followed in his wake; once in the pit, we whispered sundry inane\ncomments in his ear as he waited for the   casador \n to match the center bets.\n\n\nIt was our way of making sure that everyone knew that we were\npartners in the   Kris   entry. \n\n \n\nThe splash red was a hothead and rushed to its white opponent\nupon being released.\n\n\nThe white glided ever so slightly to its left to evade our cock 's\ncharge, turned, and pounded our   lasak   's back\nbefore it could stop its forward momentum.\n\n\nThe crowd roared at what looked like a fatal blow, but our cock\nwasn't finished yet.\n\n\nThe white 's knife had got stuck on our cock 's back and the turning\nof our cock sent the white tumbling.\n\n\nThis was all the   lasak   needed: it\nquickly got a billhold and turned on a fierce shuffle that immediately killed\nthe white.\n\n\nThe   lasak   was spitting blood and losing\nconsciousness, but its toughness enabled it to peck twice in the \n careo   before dying.\n\n\nWe had won our third fight. \n\n \n\nThe fourth fight was not as close.\n\n\nOur cock was another beautiful gray, full brother to the two that\nhad won handily in the elimination round.\n\n\nIt topped its blue opponent and destroyed its left wing.\n\n\nIt got hit in the furious shuffling which followed the first buckle,\nbut won because the crippled wing was too big a disadvantage for the blue to\novercome.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "0f1dfc0e-40b6-4815-9a50-4daad10a30ea", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.355112+00:00"}
{"text": "Generations  \n\n\n Tara Sering \n\n \n\nIt always seemed so hilarious when her mother would tell of it.\n\n\nEvery time her mother hung up her well-worn chartreuse apron with the\nred apple print and they both sat at the kitchen table over a freshly-baked\nmango cream pie, the story of Inez 's own birth always left her hiccupy with\nlaughter. \n\n \n\nInez 's mother, Marietta, would tell of eternal labor, dizzy\nspells, controlled breathing, legs hung and spread in mid-air in all its\nglory, shaved pubic hair, gadgets being poked into her, doctors peeking in\nevery now and then--the works.\n\n\nThere were no modern comforts in the nearest hospital that Marietta\nhad checked into early on that cold October morning and the labor room was\nshared by around ten women, all writhing in pain, cross-eyed with discomfort\nand sweating profusely like pigs in a stuffy old pen.\n\n\nWhen any of the women managed to sit up with a raised fist, cursing\nthe man who had caused her all this hell, nurses hurriedly brought her to the\ndelivery room.\n\n\nSomething like a crude birth indicator.\n\n\nMarietta had walked by herself to the delivery room because all the\npain in the world could not bring her to curse her husband, so the doctors\nthought she was doing OK.\n\n\nAccording to her, she felt the head drilling its way out of her when\neverybody else was busy trying to calm a woman who vowed to run over her\nhusband 's ugly pet dog as soon as she got better, or something more tragic\nthan that, you bastard.\n\n\nWith no one to attend to her, Marietta slipped sideways out of her\ncreaky bed and tried to imagine herself walking with a delicate balloon\nbetween her legs: must not fall, must not burst either.\n\n\nIn the delivery room, she helped herself onto a pale green table with\nsome of the paint coming off but nevertheless looking stable, and drawing all\nher strength from all the divinities she could think of, screamed for a\ndoctor to fucking pull her child out and into this beautiful world.\n\n\nMarietta always told this story with such humor that Inez was\npractically rolling with laughter despite the size of her own inflated\nstomach. \n\n \n\nBut things weren't funny now.\n\n\nShe, Inez, was in a labor room, alone in all her privacy, wide-eyed\nwith fear, pain, discomfort, anxiety, excitement--you name it.\n\n\nHer room was not a stuffy pen but, rather, a bright and spacious\nprivate room with a long sofa, pink curtains, a TV hanging over the door (\ncomplete with cable channels) and baskets of flowers and fruits from family\nand friends.\n\n\nHer doctor was scientific in her ways, coming in to check at regular\nintervals, explaining procedures in common man 's terms, and not relying on\nscreamed violence.\n\n\nHer husband, Emilio, would be in any moment, tired from work but\nnevertheless beaming with pure excitement.\n\n\nShe counted all these, all her blessings, and she couldn't help but\nwish she were sharing the room with nine other women, screaming bloody hell\nand sweating in buckets so she could at least think of this whole child\ndelivering thing as funny and alleviate the pain.\n\n\nBut for Inez, things weren't funny now. \n\n \n\nEven \"  The Muppet Show  \" which never\nfailed to send her reeling with laughter, was not funny now.\n\n\nStill, she stared up at the TV, picking absently at the hospital tag\non her wrist.\n\n\nShe wished her husband were at her side at the moment, and then she\nwished he 'd stop chatting in the hallway with the other mothers and then she\nwished her mother would chat till she dropped dead, too.\n\n\nShe wanted ice cream and later she imagined herself pouring it over\nthat sexy nurse 's head, the one who came checking on her whenever her\nhusband was around.\n\n\nShe imagined her child as looking like Miss Piggy and at last, she\nhad a good laugh.\n\n\nIn an all too quick shift, she was knocking on wood, making signs of\nthe cross in fear of her child actually looking like Miss Piggy.\n\n\nOr Kermit the Frog, if it were a boy. \n\n \n\nShe glanced at the small radio-clock beside a small basket of\ndaisies and zinnias on the nighttable.\n\n\nHer husband would walk in any minute now and a little later, Inez was\nsure, so would that sexy nurse.\n\n\nHer father, popularly known as simply \" \" Teddy &rdquo;\n\" to all his AM radio listeners, made his visits as scarce and as\nbrief as possible, making a thousand phone calls a day instead.\n\n\nHis excuse for not being too visible around the hospital was that he\nwouldn't want to be caught in the actual moment of delivery because if he\ndid, then what would poor Emilio 's role be? \n\n \n\nIn truth, however, ( and this everybody knew) Teddy just didn't\nparticularly enjoy the idea of resurrecting memories long dead: he had taken\na very-pregnant-with-their-first-child Marietta to a friend 's housewarming\nand that 's when their first child decided to make her very untimely entrance\nto the world.\n\n\nIt was impatiently making its way out and the look on Marietta 's\nextremely pained face petrified Teddy, particularly his jaws and knees.\n\n\nHe was in shock and remained so until way after Marietta had been\nrushed off to the hospital by the on-lookers, who after realizing Teddy 's\ninstant paraplegia, put their cocktails away and decided to take matters into\ntheir own hands.\n\n\nTeddy had to be assisted, not unlike an invalid, all the way to the\nhospital where for a full minute he couldn't recognize his own\nparents-in-law.\n\n\nAll this in front of his colleagues who, till then, had unwavering\nfaith in the hard-hitting mental alertness of Teddy, the great radio\ncommentator whose breakfast specialty was tearing into pieces each new\nPresidential Decree.\n\n\nWhenever he could help it, he was never again publicly around a\nnine-month pregnant woman.\n\n\nNot his wife.\n\n\nNot his daughter. \n\n \n\nIt was this evasion of what seemed to Inez as her father 's\ncowardly fear of his credibility being undermined and by something so small\nand fragile that she demanded Emilio be around her at all times.\n\n\nEmilio, on the other hand, was more eager to prove to Inez that he\nwas in no way as weak as Teddy and was confident of his own strength.\n\n\nAt night, lying on the hospital sofa, while Inez lay asleep, Emilio\nwould bring out a small booklet for him to work on.\n\n\nIt was a present from his father, which was entitled \"\n\" Exercises in the Development of Mind Presence. &rdquo; \"\n\n\n \n\nUnlike their father, Inez 's two older sisters, Clarissa and\nJasmine ( a self-given-and-imposed-on-everybody-else nickname, because,\naccording to her, it was an absolute injustice to call a  \"\nwoman of the ' 90s &rdquo;  Violetta which was practically a\ngrandmother 's name), both unmarried by choice, visited often.\n\n\nThey 'd come and comment on the curtains, the lighting, the lousy\nservice ( confusing the place with the hotels where they frequently lunched),\nbringing bouquets of yellow roses, mangoes and bright red apples.\n\n\nThey 'd eat the fruits themselves, tuck their legs beneath them on\nthe couch and watch TV.\n\n\nShe would watch them come and go with envy at their trim figures and\nslim cut power suits with boyfriends in tow and meetings to hurry to.\n\n\nSometimes she wished she led the kind of life her sisters did and\nsometimes she pitied them and their careers which were dedicated to no one\nbut themselves.\n\n\nSometimes she would stop wishing for anything. \n\n \n\nSometimes she would think back to when Jasmine very subtly tried\nto dissuade her from getting pregnant by saying,  \" It 's your\nstretch marks. &rdquo; \n\n\nAs if stretch marks spelled one 's doom and maybe for Jasmine 's\nmentality stemmed from her being a public figure--anchorwoman for the health\nand fitness portion of the daytime TV show  It 's Your Life, Girl! \n- - and, ultimately, from their father.\n\n\nBut what Inez could not understood was how anyone could not want\nchildren.\n\n\nDefensively and trying to look hurt, Jasmine would always say,\n \" You make it sound like I 'm some kind of monster.\n\n\nOf course I want children and if they came with a single blow of the\nnose, or a fart, for God 's sake, I 'd probably have two dozens of them.\n\n\nOne for each retirement year. &rdquo; \n\n\nThen she 'd pop another cod-liver oil capsule inside her mouth for\nbetter, clearer skin, healthier hair, and an all-around younger-looking you!\n\n\n \n\nInez 's eldest sister, Clarissa, was something else.\n\n\nAlthough she wasn't as figure-conscious as Jasmine, she kept herself\ntrim and unpregnant, but for different reasons.\n\n\n \" Joe desperately wants to get married and he 's been\nat this pleading business for  years  I think he ought to bleed some\nmore, &rdquo;  Clarissa would say before guffawing, not realizing\nthat no one in the dining table has joined her.\n\n\nEverybody was busy wondering how much longer her boyfriend, Joe,\nwould have to wait and bleed.\n\n\nIt had been five years since Joe started proposing marriage to\nClarissa and the man was now practically anemic, going about life with\nbloodshot eyes as if he could see Clarissa 's biological clock sitting on her\nhead, ticking away with the years. \n\n \n\nHe was quiet during their visits to Inez and there was a faraway\nwistfulness in his eyes.\n\n\nInez would catch him staring at her mountain of a stomach as if he\ncould see what beauty lay inside, or sometimes absently toying with the\nrattles Emilio 's friends had given in advance.\n\n\nClarissa, who admitted taking up the cause of all the women who\nsuffered at the hands of commitment-dodging men, was punishing the poor guy,\nwho, Inez believed, was one hell of a masochist for sticking it out with her\noldest sister. \n\n \n\nInez would then stop thinking and start reproaching herself for\nnot feeling so self-assured during what could be the most enlightening and\nlife-changing experience of her life.\n\n\nThen she would fall asleep. \n\n \n\nNot today, though.\n\n\nIt was 5:47 according to the radio-clock.\n\n\nThe sexy nurse was more than ten minutes late and so was Emilio.\n\n\nThe pain around her stomach was becoming sharper and sharper and\nthere was no one else in the room.\n\n\nNot her mother, not her Lamaze partner.\n\n\nAloud, she asked herself where Emilio could be.\n\n\nVery much louder, and very piercingly, she demanded to know whether\nher husband was going to show up any minute or not because if he wasn't, HE\nCOULD ALWAYS GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE MARRIAGE!\n\n\nAnd that 's when the nurses burst in. \n\n \n\nThe pain she was feeling now wasn't like the ones she had been\nfeeling during the past few days.\n\n\nNow it was about twenty times worse and she could almost hear her\nchild saying,  \" I 'm coming out.\n\n\nGangway! &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nDespite the numbing pain, the very annoying fact that neither the\nnurse nor Emilio was around, and the speed at which she was being wheeled to\nthe delivery room, Inez managed to think of what her mother had been telling\nher along with all those childbirth stories:  \" You never ask\nyourself if it 's worth all your pain.\n\n\nIt just has to happen. &rdquo; \n\n\nWhile Clarissa and Jasmine preferred to hear their father talk\npolitics and current events, Inez had listened to their mother whose words\nshe was remembering now.\n\n\nWords that were as reassuring as anesthesia in this her time of pain,\npanic and confusion. \n\n \n\nEmilio 's father, Justo, was never referred to as \"\n\" poet &rdquo; \" and definitely not \" \"\nstoryteller, &rdquo; \" except when it came to narrating his son 's\nbirth, the coming to the world of Emilio, his first-born, his pride and joy\nwho came to the world covered in blood and whatever else his wife Elsa had\ninside her.\n\n\nWhatever it was, the color and smell were intriguing, reminiscent of\nsomething--this part he left out in Elsa 's presence.\n\n\nBut alone with his son Emilio, Justo would go into great detail,\ncovering absolutely everything that came in through his five senses and\nregistered in his brain where it remained forever engraved.\n\n\nInterestingly, something new was added each time the story was told.\n\n\nSomething his eyes saw, ears heard, nose smelled, hands touched,\nheart felt.\n\n\nEmilio used to wonder where all these new features were coming\nfrom--a sudden burst of memory, perhaps? - - but as he grew older, smiled\ninstead with deep understanding.\n\n\nThe story, however, was not so much about Emilio but about Justo\nhimself and how he, at the end of it all, fainted with a smile on his lips.\n\n\nBy age seventeen, Emilio stopped wondering how his father knew he was\nsmiling when he was supposed to be unconscious. \n\n \n\nIt was a rainy night ( Elsa would insist otherwise), Justo would\nbegin, and he was tucking his legal papers away, clearing his desk of drafts\nfor petitions of three different clients.\n\n\nIt was about midnight and he was working hard, you see, until his\nhead just fell with grogginess and that was when he decided to wake up at 4\na.m. while the rest of this side of the world still savored sleep, to\ncontinue his work.\n\n\nAfter clearing his papers away, he took his coffee and started up the\nstairs with his eyes half-closed when Elsa, from the upstairs bedroom, let\nout a scream so loud he was sure her voice box had exploded.\n\n\nHe dropped the cup and saucer on the stairs, splattering hot coffee\nall over his legs, but what the hell: his wife was calling, screaming out his\nname.\n\n\nHe kicked the door open, dismantling the doorknob system, ( Elsa,\nwhenever present, would always inject that it was an unnecessary but\notherwise touching act--the door was unlocked) and found his wife sitting on\nthe floor by the nighttable, bathed in her own sweat and tears, legs wide\nopen as if something, or someone, would come crawling out.\n\n\nAt first, Justo admitted he was immobile.\n\n\nHe had been waiting for this moment all his married life, praying\nevery day for a son ( and several other specifications that it was almost\nembarrassing to God), a happy and safe delivery, and that moment--and its\nsuccess, he felt, was up to him.\n\n\nHe, the great promising young lawyer whom the senior partners looked\nto for fresh ideas, was for one of the rarest moments in his life left\nstanding at the door after having just kicked it out of the way, wide-eyed\nand frozen.\n\n\nIt was only until Elsa, screaming with double intensity, instructed\nhim to call the doctor who lived three blocks away and didn't have a phone,\nthat Justo finally budged.\n\n\nElsa 's voice rang in his ears and he wordlessly flew down the steps,\nhesitant as he was to leave his wife.\n\n\nThe household, awakened by the racket, were at the bottom of the\nstairs and he sent the younger one to fetch the doctor while the older one,\n Manang  Dessa, who had scrubbed him as a boy, calmly marched\nup the stairs, informing a wild-eyed Justo that she knew about these things\nand that she had watched her mother perform child deliveries, even actually\nhelping out.\n\n\nHands on.\n\n\nJusto, under normal circumstances, would acquire this \"\nconvince me &rdquo; attitude that lawyers always have, but at that moment, he\nwould have believed it if a twelve-year-old girl had told him that she could\ndeliver his wife 's baby while balancing a lighted candle on her head.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a51d2c37-2678-46ed-80aa-a1797a73f105", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.356533+00:00"}
{"text": "Moonlight Ride  \n\n\n Ma. Rebecca R. Arcega \n\n \n\nFather?\n\n\n\n \n\nI went out riding last night. \n\n \n\nDon't be angry with me.\n\n\nI know I 'm not supposed to go out.\n\n\nBut I got my chance when Malach forgot to shut the gates and I wasn't\nabout to let it pass.\n\n\nI had never been out.\n\n\nEver since I was born, I 'd been asking, wondering about the other\nside of those Walls.\n\n\nI 'm eighteen now, old enough to go beyond wondering, and this huge\ncity can't keep me safe anymore. \n\n \n\nAre the only people in the world the people around me, Father?\n\n\nThat 's a good question.\n\n\nEven Dantriu the scholar thought so, when first asked it.\n\n\nI was twelve.\n\n\nHe said I was a precocious child.\n\n\nSo it shouldn't be any wonder I have to find things out for myself,\neven the hard way. \n\n \n\nPlease come out and greet me.\n\n\nI 've taken too long to return home.\n\n\nI miss you. \n\n \n\nYes, I did steal \" Golden \" .\n\n\nAre you punishing me for that?\n\n\nBut I had to steal her, because I knew you wouldn't give her to me if\nI said I was to take her out.\n\n\n\" Golden \" has never been out of the Kingdom either.\n\n\nShe was the one who often looked up and tried to peer at the sky\noutside ours.\n\n\nBut of course she couldn't do that because the Walls were too tall.\n\n\nWe shared a curiosity.\n\n\nShe had to be the one I would bring out.\n\n\nI could have taken \" Stealth \" , because he was much\nfaster and stronger, but he wouldn't have liked the change of view. \n\n \n\nIt was early nighttime.\n\n\nI didn't stop to think.\n\n\nI just leapt on \" Golden \" and showed her where to\nbreak through.\n\n\nAfter that, I roved without a road.\n\n\nBut the moon was bright over the wilderness, I wasn't lost. \n\n \n\nOh, the moon. .\n\n\nYou had never told me how beautiful the moon is, Father, the moon\nover the bleak horizon.\n\n\nI 'd never seen it down so low.\n\n\nIt had always been high up, if it was in the sky at all, passing from\none edge of the Walls to another.\n\n\nAlways beyond reach.\n\n\nOutside, when I saw the moon again, Father, it was down so low I felt\nI could ride out to where it lay and snatch it out of the darkness.\n\n\nMother would like the moon for her necklace, I thought, and you would\nlike it for your crown. \n\n \n\nI spurred \" Golden \" on to chase the moon.\n\n\nThe moon fled.\n\n\nWe must have been a splendid sight, \" Golden \" and I\nspeeding across the barren plain.\n\n\nI should not wonder that the moon eluded our reach more out of\njealousy than fear.\n\n\nCoyness only made it more alluring, as it does to women, as you 've\nsaid so yourself. \n\n \n\nWe became masters of the night, \" Golden \" and\nI. \n\n \n\nHow far from the Walls did we go?\n\n\nI didn't keep track.\n\n\nThere was too much nothingness to see, a broad emptiness to bore me\nso easily.\n\n\nThe Kingdom is often crowded, as you no doubt know, and I have grown\nsick of it.\n\n\nIt was so silent out, so peaceful. .\n\n\nAnd where were the ghosts?\n\n\nWhen I was a child, you warned me that the Walls had been built to\nkeep the ghosts from bothering the citizens.\n\n\nThere were no ghosts in the wilderness, Father.\n\n\nThere was none... nothing at all. \n\n \n\nThere was nothing until we reached the sea--the first sea that I\nhad ever laid eyes on.\n\n\nAnd then there was the water and the moon, and the moon 's\nreflection, all going into forever.\n\n\nFunny, no matter how your scholars tried to explain it to me, I 'd\nnever understood forever--until last night, when I saw the sea. \n\n \n\nThe waves crashed and wailed as the wind whipped through them.\n\n\nThere was so much wind I felt like I was going to get blown away.\n\n\nAnd \" Golden \" inched back hesitantly from the\nwater, as if gently pushed.\n\n\nWith her gleaming mane flying, \" Golden \" looked a\nmarvelous creature indeed.\n\n\nWe should have wind in this kingdom, Father.\n\n\nOrder some from Malach 's boys, when next they go trekking. \n\n \n\nI got off \" Golden \" and eased myself into the\nsea.\n\n\nI wanted to feel the water.\n\n\nI wanted to know if the salt smell in the air was a trail of\nsomething that truly existed.\n\n\nImagine forever full of such valuable stuff!\n\n\nI waded, the water lapping at my ankles.\n\n\nAnd then I bent down for a sip.\n\n\nAnd do you know, Father, what I saw?\n\n\nAs I bent down, something moved upward.\n\n\nFrom the sand.\n\n\nThe water must have cleared it of its cover of rotten seaweed.\n\n\nIt was what was left of a face, a human face.\n\n\nIts mouth was open so wide its jaws were about to fall apart. \n\n \n\nI fell back, gagging.\n\n\nI 've never before seen anyone die screaming, Father.\n\n\nImagine that: eighteen years old and nary a taste or touch of malice.\n\n\nHighly improper.\n\n\nMaybe fate truly meant for me to watch the sea. \n\n \n\nFor that wasn't all that I saw.\n\n\nFather, the face looked at me.\n\n\nAt me!\n\n\nAs if I had been the one that had killed it.\n\n\nAnd when I stepped away I stumbled upon another body almost entirely\nburied in the sand--a woman this time, a wizened little thing, frozen for\neternity in a similar state of madness. \n\n \n\n\" Golden \" had trodden upon something soft.\n\n\nShe panicked and I had to hold her down.\n\n\nWhen I looked down I saw that she had encountered a human hand,\nbleached by salt and blotched with the seasons, but whole.\n\n\nWhen \" Golden \" had stepped on it, it had cracked\nand had become bent at an unsightly angle. \n\n \n\nBeneath the sand beneath me, I knew, there were hundreds more of\nsuch atrocities, perhaps even worse than the ones that I had seen.\n\n\nI stayed, unable to conceive of the cause of such a tragedy, and\nuntil I found out enough to tell you, I could not leave. \n\n \n\nBut \" Golden \" was anxious.\n\n\nShe was whinnying pitifully.\n\n\nThe least I could do for the poor creature was to lead her a short\nway from the shore.\n\n\nThere were still a few bodies there, but not quite as many as there\nwere by the water.\n\n\nIt was almost as if - - well, it may sound strange, but it was almost\nas if those people had died trying to reach the sea; fleeing from something.\n\n\nAnd what could they have done if they had reached the sea, jumped in\nand swam all the way to nonexistent other shores?\n\n\nWhat could they have been running from that was so terrible they\npreferred death by drowning to being trapped away from the sea? \n\n \n\nI tied \" Golden \" to a piece of something\nsticking out of the rocks.\n\n\nIt looked sturdy enough to hold even a frightened mare.\n\n\nI stayed beside her for a while, soothing her, before she felt safe\nenough to be left alone.\n\n\nThen I went back to the water.\n\n\nI tried not to see the faces all about me.\n\n\nI tried to feel sad.\n\n\nAll those poor people deserved the tears of the entire Kingdom, but\nthey would have to make do with what I had to offer. \n\n \n\nYou see, even without your patronage, I was a good child,\nFather. \n\n \n\nPlease come out. \n\n \n\nAnyway, it 's your loss.\n\n\nYou 're missing a very good story.\n\n\nThis really happened, Father; you must know, if there has ever been\none virtue I learned from Mother and you, it 's to be honest about every\nstory I tell.\n\n\nThe moon was as beautiful as I have just described it, and the sea\nas mystical.\n\n\nAnd the gnawing in my heart... \n\n \n\nI went back to the water.\n\n\nIt and Death had an attraction for me that was certainly magical.\n\n\nNeither was as terrible as your scholars had described them, though\nall my life I had been taught to fear things that I could not understand.\n\n\nUntil then, I had never seen the sea, or felt a million agonies\ntrembling underneath me.\n\n\nAs I stood there, facing eternity, a lonely man, I felt and thought:\neveryone behind the Walls should see this wonder now. \n\n \n\nAnd then a marvelous thing happened: \n\n \n\nI understood why those people had chosen the sea as their last\nrefuge from the vast Unknown. \n\n \n\nNo, there were no ghosts.\n\n\nYou could not tell me that again now.\n\n\nIt wasn't a ghost I saw, rising from the water, out from the very\ndeep part where nothing could possibly walk on the uneasy ocean surface.\n\n\nAt first I thought it was just some object, maybe a stray boat, or a\nlog, like the pretty things you see bobbing up and down in the perfumed\nstreams of the Kingdom.\n\n\nBut then it wouldn't sink, though the waves rose high as if to\nswallow it whole. \n\n \n\nIt was so far I still had time to run.\n\n\nBut I didn't run.\n\n\nI wanted to see if it was a ghost, as you have always been telling\nme, as everyone has always been telling me, and I wanted to see what would\nhappen if I defied you and everyone and just stayed there.\n\n\nAnd if I talked to it, maybe.\n\n\nSo I could come back, if I could come back at all, and tell everyone\nthat I had spoken with a ghost, and then not mind when no one would listen,\nbecause it would have been the truth. \n\n \n\nThe thing came closer toward me, until I could see by the light\nof the moon that it was a human form.\n\n\nIt was a woman dressed in rags, with skin as white as ivory, rough\nand half-eaten away by the strong evening tide and time.\n\n\nHer sparse hair was long and so light it whipped violently around\nwhat was left of her face.\n\n\nSuch a beautiful face.\n\n\nHer eyes, I imagined, must have been the color of the night sky.\n\n\n \n\nSomething stared out at me from out those empty sockets on her\nface, and held me where I was, until she came closer.\n\n\nShe did not step onto the shore.\n\n\nOut on the water, she stood, rigid as a pillar, yet constantly\nmoving, as though she were made of dust.\n\n\nThe waves played tricks with her image.\n\n\nI did not know if she was friend or foe, and so I did not draw my\nsword. \n\n \n\n \" You have come to us, &rdquo;  she said.\n\n\n \n\nFather, she could speak!  \n\n\nIn a voice as deep and quiet as the very bottom of the sea, she told\nme,  \" There is something we must show you. &rdquo; \n\n\nShe held out a bony hand. \n\n \n\nAll of a sudden, all around her, many other people started\nrising from their watery beds.\n\n\nAs if they had been lying in wait there for a long, long time. \n\n \n\n \" Something you must see, &rdquo;  the\nwoman said beckoning. \n\n \n\nNow I would know, Father, if she was a ghost, if I would touch\nher hand and die with the cold.\n\n\nYou had told me that yourself, you and the scholars.\n\n\nGhosts have strange magic.\n\n\nThey could even take a person 's soul. \n\n \n\nI waded out into the water to stand before her.\n\n\nSuddenly I was chest-deep in the murkiness and looking up.\n\n\nI waved my arms in the water beneath her feet, and realized she\nstood upon nothing. \n\n \n\nI had to stretch my hand up to meet hers. \n\n \n\nAnd it was not cold at all, Father.\n\n\nNot even when she held me and took me down into the water.\n\n\nIt was not cold at all. \n\n \n\nMy last thought, was that I had never been so far from home.\n\n\n \n\nFather?\n\n\n\n \n\nI had not wanted to be gone long.\n\n\nBut they had to tell me so much.\n\n\nI know it all now, because I stayed long enough. \n\n \n\nThe ones under the water were not ghosts, Father.\n\n\nThey were people.\n\n\nThey were survivors.\n\n\nYou see, something dreadful happened to the world.\n\n\nNot just some time ago, it is more like a long time ago, because it\nhappened before the building of the Walls.\n\n\nThere were no real Walls back then: people could meet people\neverywhere else.\n\n\nAll the myths were shattered, and all legends disproved by magic of\na force so brutal it was a stronger than the magic we have now.\n\n\nIt was a strong magic, to create - - and to destroy - - at the\ncommand of a single man.\n\n\nHe was a powerful man.\n\n\nBut he was foolish. \n\n \n\nAm I making sense?\n\n\nI 'm sorry, there is just too much to tell.\n\n\nThere really are vast differences within heaven, hell and everything\nin between, which was the prime knowledge of the people of the sea.\n\n\nThey gave even that to me.\n\n\nThey said they would not deny me anything.\n\n\nI was, after all, a great descendant of the greatest man who had\nlived on earth, who had the power to create and destroy by whim - - and to\nprevent both, also by his whim. \n\n \n\nDid you ever know him, Father? \n\n \n\nThey said he looked exactly like you. \n\n \n\nPlease come out... I want to see if that is true.\n\n\nHe was your grandfather, and the father of the one who built the\nKingdom and the Walls. \n\n \n\nAll the time they spent trying to describe his hateful face to\nme, I kept remembering the brightness of your smile.\n\n\nAnd the way you laughed aloud whenever the jesters sang.\n\n\nAnd your strong voice and its softness when it fell on Mother 's\nloving ears.\n\n\nYou have always been the hero, Father.\n\n\nI could not think how you could resemble such a monster. \n\n \n\nYet I could not deny their loathing, Father.\n\n\nI do not know what magic that old demon must have used to broadcast\nbitterness upon waters that flowed in and out of forever.\n\n\nAnd while I languished in those waters, I felt, breathed, lived the\nbitterness, it ate the younger part of me away. \n\n \n\nI want to see you.\n\n\nI want you to see me now. \n\n \n\nI must be your age.\n\n\nNo - - older.\n\n\nNo... older even than that!\n\n\nI must be the same age as the man who killed the world outside the\nWalls, and I can recognize him now when I look upon his face. \n\n \n\nYou really can't run away.\n\n\nYou must know that by now.\n\n\nYou could try hiding in the ruins of the Kingdom, that phony\nParadise.\n\n\nIn a sense, the ruins are more beautiful than what once was.\n\n\nThey are, at least, more truthful.\n\n\nAnd I have to be thanked for that. \n\n \n\nThe citizens don't deserve to live.\n\n\nNone of us do.\n\n\nWe survived the fury of the holocaust that had invented the world\nbecause of the very same man who had caused it.\n\n\nWe are cowards, we have always been.\n\n\nYes, indeed, you don't prove anything by belonging to a different\ngeneration.\n\n\nSomeone has to pay for his father 's sins. \n\n \n\nMother--Mother?\n\n\nWhere is she, Father?\n\n\nDo you know?\n\n\nYou had her under the ground only a few years ago.\n\n\nCan you look in the same spot and find her there now?\n\n\nWell, I 'll just tell you where to find her.\n\n\nShe 's down there with them, with everyone else.\n\n\nAt the bottom of eternity, resting. \n\n \n\nShe belongs there, Father.\n\n\nEveryone belongs there now. \n\n \n\nDown there, where it isn't cold, and where they don't believe in\nwalls.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "4aa47f3a-f7b2-4b26-9cc8-d8df2cc6958d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.357977+00:00"}
{"text": "Homecoming  \n\n\n Joel M. Toledo \n\n \n\nThe bus sped on through the April afternoon.\n\n\nHouses and trees went by in dirty browns and deep greens.\n\n\nThe people were less preoccupied and moved slowly.\n\n\nLike animated statues, Miguel thought.\n\n\nHe smiled, amused by the comparison. \n\n \n\nA love song was playing on the radio.\n\n\nThe humming of the engine and the song merged with his thoughts, the\nsoundtrack of the movie outside his window, one that he hadn't seen in a very\nlong time.\n\n\nEveryone on the bus seemed enclosed in a meditative silence, and the\ndelirious chattering that had irritated him before was gone. \n\n \n\nThe wind was getting cold.\n\n\nMiguel settled back in his seat, closed the window and closed his\neyes. \n\n \n\n\nIt was all so sudden.\n\n\n \" I have to go Miguel, &rdquo;  she said.\n\n\n \" There are a lot of good job opportunities in the\ncity.\n\n\nI want the fast-paced life.\n\n\nI want to ride cars, dine in hotels, and see all the bright lights.\n\n\nMr. Valdez promised me these.\n\n\nI need this chance, Miguel.\n\n\nPlease understand. &rdquo; \n\n\nMiguel held her hand tightly, trying to get a share of its warmth.\n\n\nHe forced a smile.\n\n\n \" Promise me you 'll come back, &rdquo;  he\nsaid, and the bus took her away, leaving only the echo of the sputtering\nengine.   ***\n\n \n\n \" San Vicente! &rdquo;  the conductor\nshouted. \n\n \n\nMiguel got off and looked around.\n\n\nThe old road has been paved and there were new concrete houses lining\nthe highway.\n\n\nHe looked at all of them with vague familiarity.\n\n\nNothing much changes here, he thought finally, seeing the old faces\nbehind the new gates. \n\n \n\nAlthough the light was fading, Miguel could see the old house\nthat stood solitary among the mango trees.\n\n\nMiguel began walking faster.\n\n\nHis two heavy bags felt lighter. \n\n \n\nAs he passed under the towering trees, the wind carried the scent\nto him.\n\n\nHe stopped for a moment and tried to remember.\n\n\nIt was a memory the city had taken from him in the seven years that\nhad passed.\n\n\n Seven years,  Miguel whispered to himself. \n\n \n\nThe orange tint of dusk highlighted the rusty wooden gate.\n\n\nIt gave out a loud creak when he pushed it.\n\n\nThe shadows cast by the  lanzones  trees in the yard\nwere lengthening, touching the terrace of Miguel 's house.  ***\n\n \n\nJuanito saw him first.\n\n\nMiguel had just stepped into the yard. \n\n  \"  Kuya  ! &rdquo;  Juanito shouted,\n \"  Nanay  ,  Kuya  's here,\n Kuya  's here! &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nJuanito ran to him laughing.\n\n\n \" Hey, you 've really grown! &rdquo;  Miguel\nsaid, patting his brother on the shoulders.\n\n\nThe last time he saw him, Juanito was just four years old. \n\n \n\n \" I 've been helping on the farm,  kuya\n , &rdquo;  Juanito said, his husky voice sounding strange to\nMiguel.\n\n\n \"  Tiyo  Peping said I 'm old enough to\ncut the coffee shoots.\n\n\nYou should visit the farm, everyone 's talking about a good harvest\nthis year. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Sure 'Nito, but one thing at a time, &rdquo;\n Miguel answered with a mild chuckle.\n\n\nAling Nena was standing at the door.\n\n\nShe was half-smiling; for a moment, Miguel thought she was happy.\n\n\nThen he saw the numerous lines on her forehead. \n\n \n\n \"  Nay  ... how are you? &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\n Aling  Nena hugged him silently.\n\n\n \" I thought you wouldn't come back anymore, &rdquo;\n she finally said.\n\n\n \" I thought you 'd forgotten that there is life outside\nthe city. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nShe 's right, he told himself.\n\n\nFor the past seven years, he did not come home.\n\n\nHe just let them know how he was doing through letters and postcards.\n\n\nThrice a year at first, then once every six months.\n\n\nBut Miguel knew he had enough reason to stay away.\n\n\nHe couldn't endure waiting.  ***\n\n \n\n Mang  Peping was very talkative at the dinner\ntable.\n\n\nHe kept lecturing to Miguel about staying. \n\n \n\n \" Besides, &rdquo;  he said, \n\" what can the city give you but noise and smoke?\n\n\nHere, everything is fresh and the air is good! &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Peping, don't give your sermon while eating.\n\n\nMiguel may lose his appetite, &rdquo;  his wife  Aling\n Letty said.\n\n\nMiguel smiled but did not speak.\n\n\nHe didn't want to discuss the reason for his return. \n\n \n\nHe continued chewing, then managed to respond weakly, \n\" It 's good to be back. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nAcross the table,  Aling  Nena was staring at him.\n\n\nMiguel knew she could feel the uncertainty in his voice.  ***\n\n \n\n \" Your  Tiyo  Peping is a great help\non the farm, &rdquo;   Aling  Nena told him while\nfixing his bed.\n\n\n \" Juanito also loves the farm.\n\n\nHe is turning out to be a hardworking boy.\n\n\nNow, a good harvest is coming up and, well, we could use an extra\nhand. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nMiguel didn't know what to say.\n\n\nHis father lived and died caring for the farm.\n\n\nBut Miguel didn't want to be a farmer.\n\n\nHe wanted a different life, the city life.\n\n\nMiguel knew his helping on the farm would really make a difference,\nbut he was determined to keep his job in the city.\n\n\nHe had worked hard to become assistant manager of the textile\ncompany. ... \n\n \n\nI could not give it up, he convinced himself.\n\n\n \" I 'll think about it,  'Nay  , &rdquo;\n he replied.\n\n\n Aling  Nena sighed and was silent.  ***\n\n \n\nIt was already very quiet outside, save for the noise of\ncrickets.\n\n\nTomorrow I 'll find out, he thought.\n\n\nHe closed his eyes and the scent came to him once more.\n\n\nHe realized he still could not remember what it was, where it came\nfrom.\n\n\nIt was all around him, filling the room.\n\n\nDisturbed by the fragrance, he found it hard to fall asleep.  ***\n\n \n\n The moment Miguel received his graduation diploma, he made\nup his mind that he wanted to go to the city.\n\n\n \" I want to go to college,  'Nay  .\n\n\nI 'm sure that 's what father would want for me. &rdquo; \n\n\n Aling  Nena was crying.\n\n\nShe knew that if it wasn't for the scholarship, she could not afford\nto send Miguel there.\n\n\n \" Of course, &rdquo;  she answered, \n\" you 're big enough to decide for yourself.\" \n\n\nMiguel hugged her with joy.\n\n\nIn his mind, he was not really thinking of college.\n\n\nSoon I will be with her, he thought.\n\n\nSoon  .  ***\n\n \n\nMiguel woke up early.\n\n\nHe wanted to visit some old friends, he said.\n\n\nBefore he could go, he was made to eat breakfast specially prepared\nby his mother.\n\n\nHe declined his brother and  Tiyo  Peping 's\ninvitation to visit the farm.\n\n\n \" Later, I promise, &rdquo;  he said. \n\n \n\nOn the  jeepney  heading for town, he completely\nforgot about them.\n\n\nIn his thoughts, there was no one but her. \n\n Miguel sighed.\n\n\nHe smiled at the thought that she may not recognize him anymore.\n\n\nHis hands came up to his well-combed hair and his eyes darted to his\nneatly ironed slacks and leather shoes.\n\n\nFit for a manager, he thought. \n\n \n\nHe recalled her beautiful laughter.\n\n\nTo his dismay, he did not find it in the city.\n\n\nSome friends told him she had already gone abroad with a boyfriend.\n\n\nOthers said she was staying with Mr. Valdez, the talent scout who\nhad brought her to the city.\n\n\nMiguel was heartbroken.\n\n\nAt first, he wanted to escape back to the province, to forget the\ncity and its bright lights.\n\n\nBut he knew deep within that this would be the cowardly thing to do.\n\n\nHe saw his mother 's disappointed face and heard the girl 's mocking\nlaughter.\n\n\nAs the uncertain days passed, Miguel realized he could draw strength\nfrom that laughter.\n\n\nBitterness drove him onward. \n\n \n\nHe focused his mind on his studies.\n\n\nHe worked hard and got good grades, even making it to the honor\nroll.\n\n\nSlowly, the thought of going back home left his mind.\n\n\nThe truth of the city became his truth.\n\n\nThe province was the lie, the pain he thought he wouldn't be able to\nface again. \n\n \n\nAfter his graduation, he stayed in the city.\n\n\nHe had a great start in his career - - he found a good job and met\nCecilia, a hardworking colleague.\n\n\nSoon, they began dating.\n\n\nA relationship emerged and Miguel was happy.\n\n\nHe thought he had completely forgotten about her.\n\n\nUntil the day Cecilia talked about marriage.\n\n\nIt was then that he decided to go back.  ***\n\n \n\nHesitantly, Miguel knocked on the door.\n\n\nAn elderly woman opened it. \n\n \n\n \"  Aling  Tinay, it 's me, Miguel.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThe woman peered at him, her grayish eyebrows meeting, then gave\nhim a big smile.\n\n\n \" Oh, Miguel.\n\n\nOf course, I remember you!\n\n\nCome in, come in! &rdquo; \n\n\nShe beckoned, offering him a seat. \n\n \n\nMiguel sat down and began,  \" It 's about your\ndaughter. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Oh, &rdquo;  Aling Tinay answered\nweakly, leaving the word hanging for a while.  ***\n\n \n\n  She did not return, Miguel.\n\n\nAfter she left, she only wrote to us twice--when she told us she was\ngoing to the U.S. with a friend, and when she announced she was going to get\nmarried.\n\n\nWell, I just hope she 's happy out there.\n\n\nI think she forgot about us.\n\n\nShe did not even tell us the address. ...   \n\n \n\nMiguel walked in silence.\n\n\nThe sun was already low, bringing a soft light around him and making\nsilhouettes of the coconut trees.\n\n\nThe air was growing colder and it carried the scent to him once\nmore.\n\n\nIt was all around him, merging with his thoughts. \n\n \n\nHe searched his heart for the great feeling of loss, the one he\nhad felt the day she left.\n\n\nHe searched for the fear, which had kept him away.\n\n\nIt surprised him that they weren't there anymore.\n\n\nSometime during the past seven years, he had unknowingly accepted\nthe loss, and, as he vividly remembered the smiling eyes of Cecilia, he knew\nwhen.  ***\n\n \n\nJuanito confronted him as he came in through the gate.\n\n\n \"  Kuya  , you said you were coming to\nthe farm with me. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" I 'm sorry Juanito, I forgot, &rdquo; \nMiguel replied,  \" I guess I lost track of the time. &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\n \" But it 's not evening yet, &rdquo;  the\nboy insisted.\n\n\n \" Besides, the moon will be bright tonight.\n\n\nLet 's go.\n\n\nI 'm sure you 'll like it.\n\n\nYou 'll see how big and beautiful our coffee plants are now.\n\n\nRemember?\n\n\nNanay said you even planted some of them yourself.\n\n\nCome on, you promised. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Well, okay, 'Nito, &rdquo;  Miguel said\nwith a chuckle,  \" I 'd like to see my plants. &rdquo; \n\n\n \n\nA light breeze brought the scent to Miguel once more, stronger\nthis time, and sweeter. \n\n \n\n \" Will you be staying for the harvest, \nkuya  ? &rdquo;  Juanito asked.\n\n\n \" There are many flowers this year.\n\n\n Tiyo  Peping said it 's a good sign. &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\nMiguel 's face lit up.\n\n\n \" It 's the flowers--right!\n\n\nThe flowers! &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nAll of a sudden, he found himself running: up the hill, over the\nsoft  carabao  grass, under the coconut trees.\n\n\nWhen he stopped, he found himself facing a thousand coffee\nplants--their flowers all in full bloom.\n\n\nBefore Miguel was a vast expanse of clear whiteness, of purity,\nshining like pearls in the late afternoon sunlight.\n\n\nShaking. \n\n \n\nHe was laughing when Juanito caught up with him.\n\n\n \" Why did you run? &rdquo;  Juanito asked,\npanting. \n\n \n\nMiguel placed his arms on his brother 's shoulders and answered,\n \" Nothing, really.\n\n\nI.... &rdquo; \n\n\nHe shifted his gaze towards the blooming coffee field anew and took\nin a big gulp of the sweet air,  \" I just didn't realize I could\nmiss anything so much. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nJuanito looked questioningly at Miguel 's smiling face and\nshrugged.\n\n\nThe next moment, he was running towards the coffee field, chased by\nMiguel 's crisp, almost childish, laughter.  ***\n\n \n\n \" I have an announcement to make, &rdquo; \nMiguel said during dinner.\n\n\n \" I 've decided to go back to the city tomorrow.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\n Mang  Peping and  Aling  Letty\nlooked at him in genuine surprise.\n\n\nJuanito sighed aloud and started to protest.\n\n\n Aling  Nena 's eyes were on her food. \n\n \n\n \" But, &rdquo;  Miguel added, \n\" I 'll be coming back next week.\n\n\nIt looks indeed like a great harvest coming, and I guess an extra\nhelp around here is needed.\n\n\nI think it 's about time I took that long-delayed vacation. &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\n \"  Talaga, kuya? \n\n\nYehey!

{"text": "Wings  \n\n\n Carlos Ojeda Aureus \n\n \n\nFlying terrifies me.\n\n\nBut last week I dragged myself by the ears to buy a one-way plane\nticket from Manila to Naga for two reasons: first, because my mother is\ncelebrating her seventieth birthday today ( next to the Pe&ntilde;afrancia\nfiesta, I do not miss my mother 's birthday); and second, because landslides\nhave blocked off the South Road again. \n\n \n\nYou heard right: until last week I had never been on a plane.\n\n\nI had never seen the inside of a plane except in the movies.\n\n\nIn fact, I had never been higher than the top story of the Naga PNB\nbuilding.\n\n\nEven that experience made me airsick for a week.\n\n\nI know what you 're thinking.\n\n\nBut let me tell you this: sitting on a plane that soars at 16,000\nfeet is not exactly my idea of travel.\n\n\nEven a bird does not fly that high.\n\n\nMaybe heaven is up there somewhere; but I 'm in no hurry to go to\nheaven yet. \n\n \n\nWhat 's all this big deal about air travel, anyway?\n\n\nAll the great men and women before \" Kitty Hawk \"\nnever got a few feet off the ground--Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Cleopatra,\nTaras Bulba--and they got where they were going.\n\n\nBut today, if you say you haven't been on a plane, people snicker.\n\n\n \n\nI have watched commercials of contented passengers dancing and\ndining in the  \" friendly skies &rdquo;  - - the\nairlines would do anything to entice you to fly--but to me, they don't mean a\nthing.\n\n\nSo what if you can call me a coward.\n\n\nI 'd rather look foolish than dead.\n\n\nSo what if I never enjoyed a fellowship for overseas study because\nnone of those silly, smirking exchange program directors approved of my\nspecial requests to travel by sea.\n\n\nSo what if I 'm fifty years old! \n\n \n\nFlying is unnatural,   Chico   .\n\n\nIt defies the laws of nature.\n\n\nIt goes against God 's will.\n\n\nIt is suicide, and suicide is a mortal sin.\n\n\nIf God intended us to fly, He 'd have given us wings.\n\n\nUntil today, there was no way anybody could do to get me on a plane\nbecause I had vowed to myself I 'd never fly unless it was a matter of life\nand death and the pilot 's family and the Pope were on board the same plane\nwith me. \n\n \n\nWhy did I change my mind?\n\n\nLike I said, it 's my mother 's birthday.\n\n\nThe second reason, however, is a lie: the South Road 's passable\nalready.\n\n\nSo why am I flying? \n\n \n\nIt 's the South Road.\n\n\nYou see, for years I always kidded myself that the South Road,\nhowever long it took ( the longer, the better, I 'd chime), was fun.\n\n\nThe bus trip is a vacation itself, I 'd convince my friends.\n\n\nYour vacation starts the very minute you board the bus.\n\n\nYou meet interesting people on the bus.\n\n\nThe food at the stopovers is great, and you get the chance to treat\nyourself to the roadside   lanzones   stands.\n\n\nBesides, what 's the hurry?\n\n\nI don't want to arrive at my destination that fast. \n\n \n\nThe brutal reality, however, is that the fifteen-hour South Road\ntrips ( if you 're lucky) mean detours, zigzags, lunar craters, smashed up\nconcrete blocks, broken transmissions, flat tires, your bus or cargo trucks\nstuck in the middle of one-way roads under repair.\n\n\nAnd since Bicolanos, when they travel, bring the whole house with\nthem, the brutal reality also means traveling under overhead racks loaded\nwith sacks of laundry and  copra  and cans of biscuits and\nboxes of leaking fish sauce. \n\n \n\nFor years I 'd arrive at my destination weary, bleary-eyed,\nunkempt, foul-smelling, beat up from being jammed up for so many hours, my\nbuttocks flattened, my feet swollen; but I kept kidding myself it was fun all\nthe way.\n\n\nPerhaps I got special delight in torturing myself. \n\n \n\nWhat about the train?\n\n\nI used to take the train, but I stopped because the toilets were very\ndirty--as dirty as our national elections.\n\n\nI think they deliberately make the toilets dirty so passengers would\nnot use them.\n\n\nI also stopped taking the train because on one night trip while I was\ntrying to open a window ( before they permanently grilled them up) to let in\nsome fresh air, somebody out there--a dead shot--threw shit at the train, and\nthe passengers ( who were asleep at that time) woke up and thereafter kept\ntheir aesthetic distance from me. \n\n \n\nI love coming home because my mother lives in Naga and refuses to\nmove to Manila.\n\n\nNot that I have to.\n\n\nI 'd take every opportunity to come home no matter how long it took\nbecause I, too, love everything about Naga.\n\n\nWell, almost everything.\n\n\nI dread Monico 's Naga jokes.\n\n\nMonico is our family driver and a self-anointed wit and positive\nthinker ( if you 're a driver, don't say you 're a driver; say you 're in the\ntransportation business).\n\n\nHe 's going to meet me at the airport and \" educate &rdquo; me\non his \" music lesson &rdquo; quizzes I heard a thousand times already:\nDoes music make you happy?\n\n\nNo, it makes Marvin Gay.\n\n\nDoes music make you think?\n\n\nNo, it makes Stevie Wonder.\n\n\n  Kurne    ! \n\n \n\nAnyway, my strongest reason for flying eclipses all others: I\nwant to conquer my fear--no, not of flying--of beautiful girls.\n\n\nYou heard me right.\n\n\nI 'm fifty years old and I 'm still a bachelor.\n\n\nMy friends envy my single-blessedness; they admire my talent in\neschewing the tender trap.\n\n\nWhat they don't know is I 'm single because courting girls terrify me\nas much as flying.\n\n\nWhat 's the connection?\n\n\nEverything.\n\n\nYou see, when I was in elementary school, I admitted my fear of\nflying to my crush.\n\n\nShe guffawed and hooted in my face so lustily I saw her tonsils\nvibrate.\n\n\nThen she turned to her   barkada   , and they\ntoo bent over and howled and shrieked their lungs out the uproar shook the\nwalls of the  Colegio de Santa Isabel  .\n\n\nI don't know, but since then, everytime I 'd approach a girl with the\nintention of courting, my knees would wobble, my voice would quiver, my jaws\nwould tighten, my eyes would blink furiously.\n\n\nI 'm afraid my fear of flying is inextricably linked to my fear of\nbeautiful girls.\n\n\nThis is the reason why I bought this ticket.\n\n\nImagine the sea change I 'd experience, the self-confidence I 'd\nexude.\n\n\nFor once, I want to feel like a hero.\n\n\nI want to be self-confident like, well, Arnold Schwarzenegger. \n\n \n\nI once watched a movie where Arnold Schwarzenegger grabbed the\nhorizontal bars of a plane 's landing gears and hanged on there in mid-air.\n\n\nBoy, did he impress the girls in Emily Theater!\n\n\nI want the girls to call me a hero, too, but how can they when I 'm\nriddled with phobias?\n\n\nSomebody jostles me in SM Cubao and I quickly check out my wallet.\n\n\nI hear a rustle and I 'm sure there 's a burglar downstairs.\n\n\nI 'm afraid of black cats, open spaces, computers, ladders, and the\nnumber 13.\n\n\nI 'm allergic to dust, tall buildings, English teachers, bridges,\nelevators, born-against  Christians,\nOpposite  Dei   Catholics,\nunderwriters, work.\n\n\nI 'm also a hypochondriac.\n\n\nI 'm afraid my shortness of breath is a symptom of a heart attack.\n\n\nI 'm afraid my migraine is a symptom of brain tumor.\n\n\nI 'm afraid these contortions in my stomach are symptoms of cancer.\n\n\nI 'm afraid of being buried alive. \n\n \n\nTo think that all these grew out of my fear of flying. \n\n \n\nBut the die is cast.\n\n\nSo I unplugged all the chords in the office, cleaned up my desk,\ndonated eggs to the Carmelite Monastery, paid my water and electric bills,\npicked up my clothes from the washer-woman, returned all phone calls,\nreturned the empty soft-drink bottles to the  sari-sari   store that did not charge me for deposit, and, for good measure,\nmade a quick pilgrimage to Antipolo.\n\n\nI also bought myself brand new Ray Ban sunglasses for the heroic\nlook. \n\n \n\nDespite the heavy traffic, I finally make it to the Domestic\nAirport, so here I am, Ray Ban and all, standing in front of the Departure\nArea, in two minds whether or not I should cross the Rubicon.\n\n\nI look around for reassuring sights, but two things immediately\nattract my attention: a sign that tells me to beware of low-lying aircraft (\nas if I can do something about it) and an insurance counter that reminds me\nthere is something unsafe about flying ( why aren't there insurance counters\nin bus or train terminals?). \n\n \n\nI want to turn back.\n\n\nBut a baggage boy appears from nowhere and threatens to carry my\n  maleta   ( where were you when I carried my\nburden from the gasoline station to this place?), and I avoid him by entering\nthe main door of the passenger terminal.\n\n\nOnce inside, I show my ticket to the guard ( all right, all right, I 'll\nplace my luggage on the belt of the X-ray machine, and my attach\u00e9 case\ntoo, you don't have to repeat it, I 'm not from Libmanan, you know). \n\n \n\nI walk towards the check-in area and weigh-in my  \nmaleta   .\n\n\nA uniformed lady attaches a tag around the handle and adheres a\nbaggage claim stub on my ticket.\n\n\nI tell her, as confidentially, as discreetly as possible, that I want\na seat as near the emergency exit as possible, and that I want a window side\nseat, you know, the usual, I tell her, to impress her that I 'm a regular\nflyer here.\n\n\nI need to look out the window so that I can appreciate the impact of\nthe crash.\n\n\nA uniformed male attendant behind her lifts my bag from the weigh-in\ncounter and throws it in the back.\n\n\nI worry that these guys might load it on the wrong plane. \n\n \n\nBefore entering the pre-departure lounge, I show my I.D. and\nticket to the two officers at the counter.\n\n\nWhile they 're busy scrutinizing my photo  sans \nthe sunglasses, I drop a twenty peso bill in the Red Cross can, and the nice\nround lady behind it beams at me and says thank you.\n\n\nA Jesuit priest once told us that no harm can possibly come to a\ntraveler who donates to the Red Cross. \n\n \n\nOnce inside the pre-departure lounge, the first thing I notice\nis the profusion of No-Smoking signs.\n\n\nThis is the airport 's subtle way of warning us of danger, I assure\nmyself to slow down my palpitations.\n\n\nI walk past the doughnut stand but I restrain myself from eating\nbecause fasting is good for the soul.\n\n\nAt the magazine stand, I buy myself the latest copy of \"\nGRAPHIC \" to relax myself, and, boy, do I relax when I read this\nwell-written feature by a Jesuit-educated, brilliant Catholic thinker who 's\ntelling me, true to the spirit characteristic of  that  Society,\nthat the mysteries of Agoo were not so joyful after all! \n\n \n\nBoarding for Naga passengers is at Gate 1, but I sit in front of\nGate 5 outside the medical clinic because I want to have a better view of the\nframed picture of the Divine Mercy (  Jesus, I trust in You, \nI keep repeating the prayer printed below the picture). \n\n \n\nFive minutes before boarding time, I go to the men 's room even\nif I do not feel like it so I won't have to use the plane 's lavatory.\n\n\nThe pressure up there is so great you could get sucked out of the\ntoilet bowl, you know. \n\n \n\nSuddenly, the yellow light with \" NAGA \"\nwritten on it and the green light beside it start blinking.\n\n\nMy eyes start blinking along with it as I solemnly rise to join the\nqueue at Gate 1, my head bowed in resignation.\n\n\nI take off my Ray Ban.\n\n\nI don't feel like a hero on Death Row.\n\n\nI pull out my boarding pass, hand it to the uniformed lady at the\ndoor, and with feet of clay, trek my last mile towards the waiting Fokker 50,\nmy attach\u00e9 case in one hand and a photo of John Paul II in the other.\n\n\n \n\nI see tow tractors pulling baggage trailers and I worry again if\nthose guys loaded my   maleta   in the wrong\nplane.\n\n\nI see water trucks, refueler trucks, boom trucks--how keen our\nsenses become when we 're on the brink of death--until I walk past the huge\nwings of my plane.\n\n\nWhat 's this fire extinguisher doing under the steps of the ramp?\n\n\nMy heart is in my throat.\n\n\nI look at the wings and wheels and wonder admiringly how Arnold\nSchwarzenegger did it. \n\n \n\nWe are welcomed by a heavily made up stewardess, and my knees\nstart wobbling again, so I wear a deadpan face to appear businesslike, and\nbesides, I do not want to entertain impure thoughts and desires.\n\n\nOnce inside, I see the other stewardess, similarly made up, assist\nthe other passengers in finding their seats.\n\n\nI look at one stewardess and the other and I get this impression\nthat they spend more time on grooming trying to look like Dolores Hart\ninstead of checking out the safety devices. \n\n \n\nI don't like this idea of sitting in this enclosed cabin, all\nstrapped in.\n\n\nI feel as if I 'm inside a giant metal toothpaste tube before they\nscrew the cap on and seal us in.\n\n\nI scan the passengers as they come in.\n\n\nThis guy looks like that fiend in that Texas chain saw massacre\nmovie.\n\n\nAh, a young mother with her infant, thank God, I hope she sits\nbeside me.\n\n\nShe does not.\n\n\nInstead I have this matron who looks like a steroid-addled\nbody-builder for company.\n\n\nI see a foreign-looking guy embark.\n\n\nHe 's carrying an attach\u00e9 case like mine.\n\n\nDid they check his hand-carried luggage for plastic explosives?\n\n\nHis eyes appear cloudy.\n\n\nI think he has something else in mind besides flying to Naga--like\nforcing this plane to fly to Libya.\n\n\nThere is a lapse in security around here!\n\n\nMore passengers come in, and I 'm annoyed by the fact that they are\nall male.\n\n\nThat 's fine, so long as they don't look like terrorists.\n\n\nOh they look harmless enough; they only remind me of Bela Lugosi,\nChristopher Lee, Peter Lore, Boris Karloff, Peter Cushing, Lon Chaney Jr.,\nVincent Price, Max Schreck.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "Skin Art  \n\n\n Andrea Pasion \n\n \n\nStanding there, actually in front of the shop, Romina felt the\nindecision move from the pit of her belly to the tips of her fingers.\n\n\n\" \" Johnny 's Skin Art, &rdquo; \" said the\nwooden signboard swinging from chains beside the door.\n\n\nThe wooden door was painted with intricate designs which some might\nconsider art, but which Romina thought looked graffiti-like, even menacing: a\nsmiling skull with a top hat, a pistol and a rose crossed below it -- the logo\nof a popular band called \" \" Guns and Roses &rdquo; \"\n; a fire-breathing dragon spreading its wings over the top of the door\nbreathing red and orange flames; and below the skull, at the bottom part of\nthe door, a chaos of flowers mixed with evil-looking elves and a raging\ntiger.\n\n\nThis was it, the place Miguel said he got his tattoo from. \n\n \n\nRomina 's indecision was slowly turning into fear and she had to\ngather up all her will to push open the door.\n\n\nShe was going through with this.\n\n\nNo matter what. \n\n \n\nA tingling of bells from a door chime announced her entry.\n\n\nThe man looked up from the wrestling match blaring from the TV set\nabove the counter.\n\n\nHe had his feet up, and his dirty black boots, almost brown with\ndust, stuck out from his even filthier jeans as he leaned way back in his\nchair.\n\n\nIt seemed as if only his feet anchored his body to the table, keeping\nhim from falling to the floor.\n\n\nThe creaky old fan in the corner did little to cool the mid-afternoon\nheat.\n\n\nThere were no windows looking out into the hot crowded street with\nits careening jeepneys and swelling rush of people.\n\n\nIt was just as well.\n\n\nThere wasn't enough breeze to blow away the warmth made worse by the\ntelevision set, and the heat which emanated from the man 's body. \n\n \n\nRomina didn't like it that the man didn't have a shirt on.\n\n\nIt seemed indecent.\n\n\nThe tattoos covering his back, his arms, and his chest, weren't\nenough to conceal his nakedness.\n\n\nAnd still, even without a shirt on, the small closed-in room was\nmaking the man sweat. \n\n \n\nThe sweat made his body glisten, giving the figures on his skin\nthe effect of being alive.\n\n\nWhen he turned to look at the TV, Romina noticed a huge bird on his\nback -- a phoenix, she imagined, ready to rise.\n\n\nA lotus flower resting on a pond on his shoulder seemed as if it had\njust burst into bloom.\n\n\nAnd on his right, a tiger, springing from his left breast, wrestled\nferociously with an angry dragon.\n\n\nHe took a long drag from his Marlboro as he reluctantly stood up.\n\n\nRomina fantasized that the smoke came from the fiery breath that was\nthe dragon 's first volley at its enemy.\n\n\nAnd the sounds of cheering coming from the television audience did\nnot seem to Romina meant for the big bald man who threw his opponent against\nthe ropes, but for the dragon who was about to instill terrible pain on the\ntiger. \n\n \n\n \" Yes? &rdquo; \n\n\nThe man looked at Romina.\n\n\nShe suddenly felt that everything about her - - her floral-print\ndress, which fell a good five inches below her knees, her long hair\nunstylishly tied behind her head, her glasses - - were all wrong for the\noccasion. \n\n \n\n \" I want a tattoo, &rdquo;  she tried to\nsound firm but she pushed her plastic-framed glasses up her nose, like she\nalways did when she was nervous. \n\n \n\n \" How old are you? &rdquo;  the man smiled,\namused.\n\n\n \" I don't do tattoos on minors. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nRomina, who was only fifteen, said she was eighteen.\n\n\nShe knew the guy wouldn't ask for her ID.\n\n\nNot on this street.\n\n\nOn this street, someone had set up a table on a corner, and was\nselling diplomas certifying that his customers graduated from the country 's\ntop universities.\n\n\nOthers had tables and tables of term papers and theses for as low as\nthree hundred pesos a piece.\n\n\nLeering men asked couples walking by if they wanted to rent a room\nwith a bed for a hundred pesos for a couple of hours.\n\n\nNo one asked for IDs, not on this street.\n\n\nAnd yet, the man mocked her.\n\n\n \" Oh, I 'm eighteen, too, &rdquo;  he said with\na laugh, his dark lips curling to show nicotine-stained teeth. \n\n \n\n \" Are you Johnny? &rdquo;  she asked.\n\n\nAnd when the man nodded, she continued.\n\n\n \" You were recommended by Miguel.\n\n\nHe said you did his tattoo. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nMiguel was eighteen and had a three-inch tattoo of an angel in\nthe inner part of his left forearm.\n\n\nTiny feathers covered its small wings.\n\n\nAnd its small cherub 's body was inspired by Cupid himself, though\ninstead of a bow and arrow, it carried a garland of roses. \n\n \n\nAnd even if Romina didn't use to think that tattoos were all that\nnice, she liked Miguel 's tattoo.\n\n\nRomina liked Miguel, too.\n\n\nHe was in her Early Latin American History class.\n\n\nHe sat next to her in the second to the last row. \n\n \n\nOf course, she had noticed him before, in the hallway and in\nfootball games.\n\n\nNormally, Romina didn't give guys like him a second glance.\n\n\nNot because she was a snob.\n\n\nNot at all.\n\n\nShe just knew, without any feeling of regret, that guys like Miguel\nwouldn't give her a second glance.\n\n\nBut apparently Miguel was different; he was nice.\n\n\nAnd, guys like Miguel were not usually nice to girls like Romina\nbecause she knew, with an almost cruel self-knowledge, that she was plain.\n\n\nShe knew that her mouth was too wide for her small face; her eyes\ncould not be described as striking or soulful, they were chinky and just a\nbit far apart, made worse by 250-grade prescription glasses; and her nose,\nwhich she considered the ugliest part of her face, was small and squat,\nunlike the pert little noses of pretty   mestiza \n girls.\n\n\nShe didn't even have the luck to come from a wealthy family,\nsomething which would have made it easier to move in Miguel 's circle, people\nwho were looked up to by virtue of their Versace jeans and Cole Haan shoes.\n\n\n \n\nIt was during class that Romina really took notice of Miguel.\n\n\nHe had smiled at her.\n\n\nRomina was surprised.\n\n\nShe was not used to being singled out. \n\n \n\nIn the beginning, she only followed him around: to the cafeteria,\nthe parking lot, a few of his games.\n\n\nWhenever he noticed she was there he would wave to her, not caring if\nhe was with his football teammates or some other friends, as if he wasn't\nashamed to greet her.\n\n\nAnd maybe that was all she needed to walk up the cafeteria counter at\nthe same moment that Miguel was purchasing a drink.\n\n\nAnd instead of buying a cheap soda, she impulsively said the brand of\njuice drink that Miguel was buying.\n\n\nIt cost more than her allowance could afford, but she thought it was\nworth it.\n\n\nMiguel had given her a wide smile. \n\n \n\n \" Hi there, Romina, right? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Yeah. &rdquo; \n\n\nShe was thrilled.\n\n\nShe searched desperately for something witty and memorable to say.\n\n\nBut nothing came. \n\n \n\n \" See ya. &rdquo; \n\n\nHe waved, and was gone.\n\n\nShe didn't have enough money for lunch that day but she didn't care.\n\n\nMiguel had noticed her. \n\n \n\nBut what made Romina almost certain that she stood a chance with\nhim was the day in a class when he had picked up a pen which she had\nnervously dropped.\n\n\nTo some, it would have meant nothing.\n\n\nBut the pen rolled all the way to the back row.\n\n\nAnd instead of waiting for someone at the back to pass it up front,\nMiguel had stood up to get it himself.\n\n\nShe had whispered almost inaudible thanks. \n\n \n\n \" No problem, &rdquo;  he answered with a\nsmile.\n\n\nIt was then she noticed his tattoo: the angel that was meticulously\ninked on his skin seemed to be offering her the garland together with the pen\nthat Miguel held in his palm. \n\n \n\n \" That 's nice, &rdquo;  she whispered,\nshy. \n\n \n\n \" Thanks. &rdquo; \n\n\nAnd then, he winked at her. \n\n \n\nMaybe it was the wink that did it, but something made her say,\nputting the pen to her mouth,  \" Y'know, I 've always wanted a\ntattoo. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Really? &rdquo;  Miguel 's eyes widened\njust a fraction.\n\n\n \" My friend Joanne has a tattoo, too.\n\n\nShe 's the only girl I know who has one. &rdquo;\n\n\nBy the sound of his voice, it was obvious to Romina that he liked\nJoanne.\n\n\nBy the way he was looking at her, she also knew that he now saw her\nin a different light.\n\n\nSimilar perhaps, Romina thought, to the way he viewed Joanne, and she\nwas happy. \n\n \n\nJoanne must be one of those girls who came to school in designer\nclothes and soft shiny hair, highlighted a fashionable brown in places which\ncaught the light.\n\n\nShe was invited to all the parties because everyone wanted to be\nseen with her.\n\n\nShe laughed out loud with the boys and flirted with them without\nfeeling shy at all.\n\n\nShe could also think of a witty remark to make a decent\nconversation.\n\n\nIn that instant, Romina wanted to be a Joanne, a laughing, flirting,\nsought-after Joanne. \n\n \n\n \" I 've always wanted a tattoo of a butterfly.\n\n\nBut I don't know anyone who could do it well. &rdquo; \n\n\nRomina knew it was not like her at all to cross her legs in the way\nshe imagined the Joannes of Miguel did.\n\n\nBut at that moment, she, too, crossed her legs, and swung her foot\neven.\n\n\nShe even straightened her hair back and lifted her chin, and threw\nher hair back as a sign of the new confidence she had felt the moment Miguel\nhad picked up her pen and winked. \n\n \n\n \" I know this great place on Recto, &rdquo;\n Miguel had said.\n\n\nAnd he went on and on about Johnny and his tattoo shop, how good\nJohnny was, how clean his method, how reasonable his price.\n\n\nRomina had nodded eagerly and giggled, happily soaking in Miguel 's\nattention.\n\n\nShe had decided she was going to get that tattoo, and had asked for\nwritten directions to Johnny 's shop. \n\n \n\nThat night, she stood naked in front of her mirror, criticizing\nher body, searching for just the right spot to put a tattoo.\n\n\nHer arms, she thought, were too thin to give a tattoo any drama.\n\n\nEven if she had the courage to put one just above her left breast,\nso that it would peep above a blouse 's neckline, her breasts were too\ninsignificant to draw attention to them.\n\n\nHer back would have been a good place, but a tattoo there would\nalways be out of sight.\n\n\nAnd she wanted Miguel to notice.\n\n\nShe wondered where Joanne had her tattoo.\n\n\nIt must be in some uncreative place like her cleavage, she decided.\n\n\nThe idea made her laugh.\n\n\nAnd what kind of tattoo would a girl like Joanne have?\n\n\nShe bet it would be a cute little heart.\n\n\nRed, of course.\n\n\nUgh.\n\n\nSurely, Miguel could not possibly like a girl like that for long.\n\n\nFinally, after much deliberation, she settled on the part of her leg\njust above the right ankle.\n\n\nIt was perfect.\n\n\nHer legs she judged to be fairly pretty and nicely shaped as a\nresult of the many walks she took to save on bus fares.\n\n\nShould she \" accidentally &rdquo; drop her pen, he would\nsurely notice. \n\n \n\nAll that had happened the previous week.\n\n\nRomina would be meeting Miguel again for class next week, just\nenough time for her to get that tattoo.\n\n\nRomina couldn't wait to see him, to show him. \n\n \n\n \" Yes, that 's right, &rdquo;  the man\nsaid.\n\n\n \" Yeah, I know Miguel.\n\n\nSo what did you have in mind? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Uhmm, I wanted a butterfly just above my ankle.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\n  \" Did you bring a design? &rdquo; \n\n\n\n\n \n\n \" Uh, no.\n\n\nI was hoping you could help me. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThe man took out a thick plastic folder from under the counter.\n\n\nAfter flipping through it for a while, he inverted it and shoved it\ntowards Romina.\n\n\n \" See if you like any of those. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nThe spread was filled with all sorts of winged insects.\n\n\nThere were dragonflies, mosquitoes, bugs and butterflies in\ndifferent stages of flight.\n\n\nSome had their wings closed, like delicate petals.\n\n\nOthers were caught in mid-flight, as if about to ascend to the\nskies, and others still had their wings fully spread, with intricate details\nof veins, patterns and colors displayed to the fullest.\n\n\nTo Romina, they were all frightening.\n\n\nOr maybe they were all beautiful.\n\n\nRomina couldn't tell.\n\n\nShe couldn't tell which one was the best.\n\n\nOr simply which Miguel would like. \n\n \n\n \" How much does it cost? &rdquo;  Romina 's\nvoice was soft, her eyes on the pictures. \n\n \n\n \" Three thousand for a small to medium-sized one.\n&rdquo; \n\n\nThe man took another drag from his cigarette and chuckled, his eyes\non the TV screen.\n\n\nThe bald guy on the screen was huffing and puffing at the camera.\n\n\nRomina had a total of &peso;5,000 in her savings account, and she\nhad withdrawn almost everything, leaving only a few hundred pesos to keep the\naccount open.\n\n\nShe had not been sure how much the tattoo would cost.\n\n\nIt was all she had saved from what seemed like a thousand Christmas\nand birthday presents.\n\n\nShe knew she could get a tattoo for much less, from an enterprising\nart student, for example.\n\n\nBut this was the best shop in town, Miguel had said, and definitely\nsafe.\n\n\nJohnny even had a certification from the Department of Health tacked\non his wall.\n\n\nA fleeting thought crossed her mind -- something about the vendors\noutside who sold fake documents.\n\n\nBut Romina brushed it away.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "13e49a50-0577-4832-b11b-33b03172c5bb", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.362395+00:00"}

\"\nand took her out into the streets of Manila. \n\n \n\nFrom the streets of Manila, her family 's Dodge Coronet had taken\nher once in the past in the opposite direction, to the airport, America her\ndestination.\n\n\nThen, she was a young seventeen, but her age aside, anyone who looked\ninto those limpid eyes knew that she was clear about who she was, her gently\npursed lips speaking an assured confidence.\n\n\nCeleste was, after all, valedictorian of her class at \"\nImmaculate Conception \" , aside from being the owner of every award\nthey offered, from spelling to speech, from model student to math.\n\n\nThe last she liked best; math had always struck her as signifying an\ninfinite number of possibilities, just like America. \n\n \n\nShe carried herself with a budding grace, radiating the same\nbeauty and life that shone out through her eyes.\n\n\nHer lithe body spoke of her youth, holding the promise that the woman\nwas just butterflying out of her warm cocoon.\n\n\nHer light-brown skin wrapped itself tenderly around her supple body,\naccentuated by the butterfly below her knee. \n\n \n\nCeleste and her grandmother clasped hands before the long and\nlast goodbye; emotions unraveled in a slow, finger-by-finger letting go.\n\n\nShe asked  Tatang  , their driver, to take good care\nof her grandmother.\n\n\nAs if they were saying it for the very first time, her grandmother\nand  Tatang  repeated the lines they kept repeating on the\nway, telling her to take good care and to warmly watch over herself. \n\n \n\nHer eyes were much too salty by the time she entered the\nterminal, by the time the Dodge drove away.\n\n\nCeleste wiped her tears, feeling embarrassed that people might see\nher all-puffed-up eyes.\n\n\nThey might think that this young, flat-chested girl had not slept,\nand stayed up the whole might like an over-excited kid before her first\nplane-trip overseas. \n\n \n\n \" You are a Filipino, Ma'am? &rdquo;  the\ntaxi driver asked, glancing at the rear-view mirror.\n\n\nSeveral garlands fragrant with  camia  and \nsampaguita  flowers hung around the mirror, together with a picture\nof Jesus intoning God 's blessing on the trip. \n\n \n\n \" Um yes, &rdquo;  she smiled.\n\n\nExcept for the breast, she thought, but that was hardly a proper\nthing to say.\n\n\nShe was a late bloomer, and it was in America that her pointed\nbreasts grew to their present firm, smallish size.\n\n\nThey were not like Nisha Narvane 's, her former roommate, whose\nbreasts were globes and whose waist the thinnest orbit, enough to transport\nNisha to the many-starred galaxy of Hollywood.\n\n\nNisha Narvane ( Celeste always called her by her full name) dreamed\nof going back to India, of making it as an actress.\n\n\nMany nights in their narrow room, Nisha Narvane starred in private\nproductions as she sang and swayed her  sari  - covered\nhips for Celeste. \n\n \n\nThey had started at BU together, when both were new to Boston and\nfinding America difficult.\n\n\nAt BU and at Bay Bank, where she had got a job as part-time teller,\npeople called her \" Miss Africa \" , unintentionally\nemphasizing she was different from them.\n\n\nIt took some time for Celeste to get used to her beauty-queen status,\nand there were many moments when she wished that she could just take her\nmother 's maiden name.\n\n\nThen they would call her \" Miss Maria \" much more\ngeneric and plain, and not so pointedly different. \n\n \n\nThe former Aurora Isabel Maria died when Celeste was three.\n\n\nCeleste remembered the vague, gentle roundness of her mother 's face,\nbut not much else.\n\n\nShe remembered her father better--a handsome man, fine and sharp\nfeatures lining his face.\n\n\nHe had disappeared in the early weeks of martial law and was never\nagain seen, leaving Celeste with her grandmother, who brought her up and whom\nshe loved very, very much. \n\n \n\nHer memory kept deep impressions of voices.\n\n\nIn her mind, the sound of her father 's voice calling her name still\nresonated.\n\n\nHe had always brought something home for her.\n\n\nNobody called her name as beautifully as her father and nothing as\ncalming to her.\n\n\nHer grandmother 's voice was also clear, still promising to teach her\nhow to weave seamless garments when she was old enough. \n\n \n\nIn America, people omitted the \" 'e' \" and\npronounced her name as \" \" Ce-lest. &rdquo; \"\n\n\nBetween this and being called \" Miss Africa \" , she\nfound herself at a loss as to which she detested more.\n\n\nHow many were those she had corrected, once, twice, thrice, up till\nshe has tired of counting, who just could not call her the way they should,\nin the manner of a father calling his daughter.\n\n\nShe had known herself as \" \" Ce-les-te &rdquo;\n\" all her life,   may lambing sa dulo   .\n\n\n\" \" Ce-lest &rdquo; \" sounded very much like a\nforeigner to her. \n\n \n\nThen Richard came along, in her third year of listening to the\nname \" \" Ce-lest &rdquo; \" , bringing along with him\nthe chance of finally ending her reign as \" Miss Africa \" .\n\n\nFrom the first moment she met him at Bay Bank, Celeste was madly in\nlove.\n\n\nNever mind that he wore his pants high.\n\n\nShe enjoyed and toyed with the idea of being called \" Mrs.\nSheridan, Mrs. Sheridan, \" repeating the name to herself over and\nover again.\n\n\nHow does \" Mrs. Sheridan \" sound?\n\n\nNever mind how you pronounce \" Celeste \" .\n\n\nDoesn't \" Ce-lest Sheridan \" sound just absolutely\nperfect?\n\n\nShe asked Nisha Narvane the nights she did come home to their shared\nroom, all the time conjuring in her mind life together with her beautiful\nRichard, giving birth to his children.\n\n\nFor her, America began to wear a more kindly face, and she thought\nthat America might fulfill her dreams after all. \n\n \n\nCeleste was ecstatic half a year into their relationship, deep\ninto final examinations, when her home pregnancy kit turned pink.\n\n\nShe called Richard with the excited news at John Hancock, where he\nworked.\n\n\nRichard said he was overwhelmed and overjoyed by the news, which made\nCeleste turn an even happier shade of pink on her end of the line. \n\n \n\nAfter they had put the phone down, Celeste realized Richard did\nnot offer to make her \" Mrs. Sheridan \" , queen of his\nhousehold.\n\n\nHe didn't mention anything about the two of them finally getting\nmarried.\n\n\nMuch later, when the operator at John Hancock told her Mr. Sheridan\nwas out of town more times than she cared to hear, she realized what Richard\nmeant when he said that he was overwhelmed.\n\n\nCeleste charged to his house and after a foreign exchange of epithets\nand invective four-letter word shouts, with an armful of clothes, came crying\nhome to Nisha Narvane 's arms. \n\n \n\nHer tears continued all the way into the next morning, and the\nday after that, when results came out showing she had failed the advanced\nstatistics exam.\n\n\nOver delivered \" Domino 's \" , she contemplated the\nimprobability of it all: why her life was falling all in a row, falling for\nthe wrong man without having counted on it, or even having seen the\npossibility of it, fearful that her ability to calculate had been diminished\nif not altogether drained and disappeared.\n\n\nOr, the possibility entered her mind, had she left them behind,\nsomewhere along the way? \n\n \n\nShe was in those weeks about to give up her Disney dreams of\nAmerica when she felt an unexpected wetness between her legs and her period\ncame as scheduled that month.\n\n\nShe read the instructions on the kit again and found that she did not\nfollow the directions and had done the test wrongly.\n\n\nIn sobbing tears, she wondered how she could have done the test\nwrong, happy at the same time that it was.\n\n\nAnd later on, through a clogged nose, and in subdued chuckles beside\na table-top of consumed tissue, Celeste kept repeating to Nisha Narvane the\nslogan that stood for what she learned through this period of her life--that\nDick was a dick. \n\n \n\nThe Sunday afternoon of Celeste and Nisha Narvane 's graduation,\nthey passed outside the chapel and found that the doves had not yet flown\naway.\n\n\nAt BU, tradition had it that the many doves of the metal sculpture\nwould fly away the year all the females in the graduating class were virgins.\n\n\nThey looked at one another and shouted  \" Dick is a dick\n&rdquo;  , making heads turn and confounding other red-garbed\ngraduates who in their own moment of achievement could care less what it\nmeant. \n\n \n\nThey had dinner at Hong Kong Cafe, on the ground floor of the\nHojo on Commonwealth Avenue.\n\n\nThe manager offered them silver utensils but they declined and\njoyfully fumbled with their chopsticks.\n\n\nIt was the best dinner of their stays in America.\n\n\nThe sound of Hong Kong made Celeste feel very near to her\nPhilippines.\n\n\nAnd she thought of her grandmother. \n\n \n\nFourteen years she worked for Bay Bank in America, her land of\nopportunity, before she got an office with a window.\n\n\nShe left her room with Nisha Narvane along with riding the T for a\nHonda parked outside her own two-storey house off Newbury street, in a\ndistrict lined with magnolias. \n\n \n\nCeleste loved living in a real house once again, after the many\nyears.\n\n\nShe especially enjoyed the busy week when she furnished her house,\nthe trips beyond number to Home Depot and the pairs of feet that carried her\nfill of furniture into the house, until she dropped with exhaustion onto one\nof them with a smile of unexhausted happiness at the blooming magnolias\nbeyond the window. \n\n \n\nIt was not long before the house grew unbearably quiet and big\nfor her, and she pushed the oppressive silence aside with wind chimes by the\ndoor, the whirring sound of a  shiatsu  couch, a talking\nalarm clock that can learn to say its owner 's name, a radio station that\nconstantly proclaimed forty percent chance of rain, a television left open\nand unwatched.\n\n\nWhen the VCR and cable proved finally futile, she went out for a\nbreath of air. \n\n \n\nBut outside, she could hear the Charles whisper its disdain at\nimmigrants who promenaded by its banks alone on long weekends, and she was\nlost among the  colleens  and the crowd on St. Patrick 's\nDay.\n\n\nThe tulips were just starting to bloom when she revisited the swan\nrides, but amid the weeping willows she soon found kids who stared unkindly\nat single ladies who refused to grow-up, and much more sad, the remembered\nmemory of who she used to ride with, back when she thought the clouds '\nreflection on \" John Hancock \" was beautiful. \n\n \n\nShe knew she needed someone, and she reminded herself to be more\nsocial.\n\n\nThe occasional convention outside town she began to welcome.\n\n\nOnce, she went out with the guys from the bank; they told her it was\nimperative for her to watch the Celtics ' last game at the Garden.\n\n\nThe special souvenir pennant cost her fourteen dollars and\nninety-five cents.\n\n\nShe especially loved hearing the Boston Pops at Symphony Hall,\nremembered her grandmother when she heard them play \" \"\nUnforgettable &rdquo; \" .\n\n\nBut she stopped going when John Williams left and was replaced by\nthis young and brash Johnny-come-lately.\n\n\nShe resigned herself to sitting beside life-sized Red Auerbach in\nFanueil Hall, who sat and unmindfully calculated court positions with bronze\ncigar in hand, and who never answered her queries about his strategies of\nsuccess. \n\n \n\n \" You are away many years? &rdquo;  the\ndriver piped in again. \n\n \n\n \" More than fifteen. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" So welcome.\n\n\nYou are  balikbayan    pala   .\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Thanks. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" You are here for long time? &rdquo; \n\n\n \n\n \" No, just here for a vacation, &rdquo; \nCeleste answered, managing another tired smile.\n\n\nShe was happy to see a   kababayan   , a\nfellow Filipino who for the sake of being friendly was struggling with his\nEnglish, but who could pronounce her name correctly.\n\n\nNot that it mattered any, since it had been years since she heard\nanyone call her \" \" Ce-les-te &rdquo; \" and the sound\nof it seemed far too distant for memory.\n\n\nBut the long trip had exhausted her thoroughly, and her journeyed\nbody was too tired to welcome conversation.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c14a4500-7f3e-464b-a14f-84ac54028cfd", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.363941+00:00"}
{"text": "A Fine Balance  \n\n\n By ROGELIO CRUZ \n\n \n\n There are games friends can play in a resort 's swimming\npool.\n\n\nThe most serious perhaps you can neither teach nor learn, unless you\nrelax, let yourself just float in the water.  \n\n \n\nThe three played in the pool, Claire more adept than the other\ntwo.\n\n\nShe was into practically every sport imaginable and now she did what\nshe could in the largish but kidney-shaped pool.\n\n\nPaolo was a bit athletic himself, although as far as Vincent was\nconcerned, he was more of a basketball freak.\n\n\nHe tried a couple of times to catch up with Claire 's laps.\n\n\nVincent, on the other hand, stayed close to the pipe issuing the water\nand tried to enjoy the hot bath for what it was supposed to be - - and the\nwater was indeed very hot, and the weather was particularly warm.\n\n\nIt was already late-November, and the late afternoon breeze was\ngetting stronger but not colder. \n\n \n\nThe pool was, in fact, an untiled cemented pit, painted light\nblue.\n\n\nThe improvised nature of the place was its genius.\n\n\nIt was nothing near five-star, but its sheer neatness ( except for\nthat attendant) and simplicity, and most of all the abundance of plants made\nit, in its own uncanny way, splendid.\n\n\nThe cottages were as small as a real   kubo  \n, but made of sturdier wood; and then they were scattered in the middle of\nwhat was practically a botanical garden.\n\n\nAside from the infinite array of trees and ferns and air plants and\nflowers in one place at the same time - their robustness was literally\nout-of-this-world, they felt animal.\n\n\nRural soil must be different.\n\n\nThere were Birds-of-Paradise clusters five feet tall with heads as\nlarge as human fists; palm trees with stems as thick and long as outstretched\nhuman arms, ready to eat you whole; heart-shaped leaves, with stalks a\nfrighteningly rich and bright green, that could smother your face.\n\n\nOn their way to the pool, Vincent picked a small white flower and put\nit over Claire 's ear.\n\n\nHe picked another one and put it over his own ear; and he picked yet\nanother one and put it over Paolo 's ear, but Paolo was bothered by it and\nwhisked it away. \n\n \n\nIt was all Paolo 's idea; Vincent had known him to be as\nimpulsive as hell in high school, and now, shoved by the world into college,\nhe was freer than ever.\n\n\nHe drove all the way from Quezon City to Vincent 's house in\nPara&ntilde;aque to play basketball, but when they got to the village\nclubhouse, it was closed.\n\n\nHe had a mad urge to go somewhere, and of course they had to get\nClaire to go with them, too; she was in the same neighborhood anyway.\n\n\nThree hours later they were m Laguna, Paolo and Vincent swimming in\ntheir shorts. \n\n \n\nThey arrived at the resort late in the afternoon.\n\n\nAn attendant emerged behind the gate, in a soiled haIf-open shirt and\nescorted them disenchantedly to their cottage.\n\n\nWhen the attendants saw them disrobing by the poolside, they knew\nwhat to do and turned on the pumps, in an equally disenchanted manner.\n\n\nThe three were the only people in the pool at the time; they seemed\nto be the only people in the resort, aside from a dozen corporate people\nengrossed in their seminar in the function rooms, physically and\npsychologically distant from them. \n\n \n\nClaire swam to Vincent near the pipe, and Paolo, left alone on\nthe other end of the pool, walked to them - - walked, for the water was only\nup to their breasts.\n\n\nShe gently leaned backwards, until she lay floating on the water, her\narms apart; her legs in a gentle pedaling motion that sent her moving around\nslowly. \n\n \n\n \" I can never do that, &rdquo;  Vincent\nsaid. \n\n \n\n \" I couldn't, either. &rdquo;  Paolo said,\ntoo. \n\n \n\nVincent was looking at Claire and when she saw him she stopped\nand stood up.\n\n\n \" What?\n\n\nOh, it 's easy, &rdquo;  she said.\n\n\n \" The key to it is, you have to relax.\n\n\nBelly up, neck straight.\n\n\nNice and easy.\n\n\nIf you get tense,   wala na   . &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\n \" I used to be able to do it before, but now I can 't,\nand I really don't know why, &rdquo;  Vincent continued. \n\n \n\n\" I can teach you to float on your back, &rdquo; \nClaire offered Vincent.\n\n\n \" Come.\n\n\nI could guide you with my hands. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n\" Oh no, never mind, &rdquo;  Vincent replied\nquickly.\n\n\n \" I knew, I  knew  how to, when I was a kid,\nbut I can't pull it off anymore... &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n\" That 's why I 'll teach you again, &rdquo; \nClaire said.\n\n\n \" Come on, Vince.\n\n\nIt 's simple\".  \n\n \n\n \" No, never mind. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n\" Why won't you? &rdquo;  Claire asked, frowning at\nhim.\n\n\n \" Paolo, could you help me with him? &rdquo; \n\n\n \n\nPaolo looked at Vincent, sneering, and raised his hands from\nunderneath the water, feigning to grab him. \n\n \n\nClaire also giggled.\n\n\n   \" Sige na, &rdquo;   \nshe said. \n\n \n\nVincent moved slowly away from them.\n\n\n \" I can't believe this. &rdquo; \n\n\nPaolo chased him very slowly, hopping in slow motion, through the\nwater, laughing, until both of them reached the other end of the pool.\n\n\nSuddenly they forgot their purpose.\n\n\nClaire again swam to them - - she was quite a graceful swimmer - -\nand emerged from the water smiling.\n\n\n \" Let 's play a game.\n\n\nOne of us is going to ask another one a question, and that guy has to\nask  another  person another question.\n\n\nIf he can't ask another guy another question in, like, three counts,\nthen the guy  has  to answer the question he 's asked.\n\n\nGets? &rdquo;   \n\n \n\nPaolo stroked the stubble on his chin, grinning,  \"\nHmmm.\n\n\nWorth a try. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Okay, Pao, you start. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Okay.\n\n\nBink, &rdquo;  Paolo started,  \" Are you still a\nvirgin? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nVincent was startled.\n\n\n \" Uh, Claire: How do you see yourself ten years from\nnow? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nClaire answered:  \" Vince, who was your first crush?\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Pao, whatever drove you to bring us to this place\nall of a sudden? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Bink, if you had the chance to do it right now,\nwould you? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nVincent looked at Claire momentarily, apologetic.\n\n\n \" God, Pao...\n\n\nUh, what do you  mean  by 'doing it'? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n   \" Bink, ba't ayaw mong magpahawak kay\nClaire? &rdquo;    \n\n \n\n   \" Ha?  \"  \n\n\nVincent sighed and rolled his eyes.\n\n\n \" Claire, what do we do with this  nimshi\n  ? \"  \n\n \n\n \" What do you think, Vince?\"  \n\n \n\n \" What do you think, Claire? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Pao, has your friend always been like this?\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Vincent: have you ever french-kissed someone?\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Claire: have you ever french-kissed someone?\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Pao, what time is it? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Vincent, what do you think of Claire? &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\n   \" Bakit, Paolo, magpapahawak ka ba kay\nClaire? &rdquo;    \n\n \n\n \" Claire, what do you think of me? &rdquo; \n\n\n \n\n \" Vincent, what do you think of Paolo? &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\n \" Paolo, why are you so obsessed with sex? &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\n \" Claire: what 's 2 plus 2? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Vince, what 's so wrong with sex? &rdquo;\n \n\n \n\n \" Pao, look at what you 've led us to.\n\n\nI mean...\n\n\nPao, uh-wait!\n\n\nPao: who do you love? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nAnd so on and so forth, until they grew tired of the game,\nprobably in part because no one could be caught and penalized.\n\n\nVincent was almost caught a number of times, but he always managed to\nask at the last count, and the other two, being unusually just, let him get\naway.\n\n\nAnd indeed, most of the questions Paolo asked were about sex.\n\n\nMinutes later, Vincent announced that he wanted to get out of the\nwater already.\n\n\nHe asked Paolo and Claire if they wanted to quit, too, and Paolo\nreplied that they 'd been in the water for only an hour.\n\n\nClaire said she wanted to stay longer.\n\n\nVincent went to the shower room alone. \n\n \n\nVincent discovered that as the shower was left running, for some\nreason the water became hotter and hotter.\n\n\nThere were also no cold water taps.\n\n\nDesperate to get the soap off his body, he alternated among all the\nsix showers in the room, turning one off, running to the next and turning it\non, then off, and then to the next.\n\n\nEventually, though, all the showers turned too hot.\n\n\nHe tried to stand it as much as he could, just to get the soap off;\nbut in the end he felt he had slightly burned a part of his back. \n\n \n\nWhen Vincent returned to the pool, changed into a tie-dyed pair\nof shorts, he saw Claire helping Paolo float on his back.\n\n\nHe was lying with arms out too far, legs moving clumsily.\n\n\nClaire was at his side, one hand under the small of his back and the\nother near a shoulder blade.\n\n\nHis belly protruded from the water, his glistening wet face smiling.\n\n\nThey laughed. \n\n \n\nVincent stood by the pool and watched them.\n\n\nHe sat by the side and put his legs into the water.\n\n\nHis face suddenly broke into a smile. \n\n \n\nShortly Paolo had enough.\n\n\nHe stood up in the water and said he felt like getting out already,\ntoo.\n\n\nOn his way to the shower, Vincent warned him about the hot water and\ntold him not to bother soaping anymore.\n\n\nClaire said she would go to the showers after a few minutes. \n\n \n\nPaolo in the showers and Claire having gotten out of the pool as\nwell, Vincent remained with his feet in the water.\n\n\n \" I think I burned my back, &rdquo;  he said,\nClaire behind him, unfolding a towel. \n\n \n\n \" What? &rdquo;  she asked. \n\n \n\n \" I think I burned my back, &rdquo;  he\nrepeated, turning his head to her.\n\n\n \" The shower was freaking hot. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nClaire hung her towel on the back of a monobloc chair and went\nto Vincent.\n\n\nShe squatted behind him.\n\n\n \" It 's reddish, but does it hurt? &rdquo; \n\n\n \n\n \"   Hindi naman   .\n\n\nCan you do me a favor? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" What? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" There 's some Noxzema in my bag.\n\n\nCan you get it and put some over this? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Sure. &rdquo; \n\n\nShe got up and went to his bag, on the poolside table.\n\n\nShe returned with the large imported jar of Noxzema, took a moderate\namount of it in her fingers, and spread it lightly and slowly over Vincent 's\nreddish back. \n\n \n\n \" Shit, Vincent, &rdquo;  she said,\nbreaking their silence. \n\n \n\n \" What, &rdquo;  he said, alert in a\nsecond. \n\n \n\n \" I 'm really in love with him.\n\n\nI was in love with him the first time I met him. &rdquo; \n\n\n \n\n \"   Yan naman   , go girl.\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\n   \" Selos ka ba? &rdquo;  \n\n\n\nShe bit her lower lip. \n\n \n\n   \" 0o ba  . \n\n\nI 'm so jealous I can't take it anymore. &rdquo;  \n\n \n\nShe laughed gently. \n\n \n\nPaolo in bermuda shorts appeared from behind the giant palm\ntrees, and loudly complained about the outrageously hot showers with no cold\nwatertaps.\n\n\nHe gruffly continued to dry himself.\n\n\nVincent told Claire the Noxzema was enough; if he didn't ask her to\nstop she probably wouldn't.\n\n\nAfter Paolo had dried himself, he went over to Vincent by the pool,\nand Vincent greeted him with a splash of water.\n\n\nPaolo swore and told him to quit.\n\n\nVincent stood up and punched him strongly on the small of his back.\n\n\nPaolo hollered at him.\n\n\nHe showed his burned back, and Paolo looked at it curiously for one\nsecond.\n\n\nThen both of them stared blankly at the pool, wondering what they\nshould do next, Paolo 's arm resting lightly around Vincent 's waist, and\nVincent 's arm hung over Paolo 's shoulder. \n\n \n\nSuddenly, after looking behind them to Claire, who was combing\nher hair, Vincent, grinning, dragged Paolo away.\n\n\nPaolo followed, limping on purpose like a ragdoll. \n\n \n\n \" Know what?\" \n\n\nVincent asked him when they were but barely out of earshot. \n\n \n\n \" What? &rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Claire and you will make a perfect couple!\n&rdquo;  \n\n \n\n \" Huh? &rdquo; \n\n\nPaolo exclaimed, eyes wide.\n\n\n \" What are you talking about?\n\n\nWhat are you - - screw you.\n\n\nStop this.\n\n\nGo away. &rdquo; \n\n\nHe scrambled away from Vincent 's arm. \n\n \n\nHe returned to Claire and Vincent followed.\n\n\nThe three sat down at the round poolside table and decided they\nwould have a snack.\n\n\nAfter calling a waiter and ordering, Paolo seemed to be in a better\nmood; and so while waiting, he and Vincent sang, with a bit of choreography;\nan Old Purefoods Chicken Nugget commercial jingle, while Claire buried her\nface in her hands and giggled uncontrollably.\n\n\nBy this time, the sun had almost set; the attendants (\ndisenchantedly) started turning on the lights over the pool, on the\nlampposts, and over the tables.", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "57deed9b-3e63-4606-8cec-eec7792cbf71", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.365150+00:00"}
