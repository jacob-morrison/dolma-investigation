{"text": "<Linguistics essays>\n\n\n<$A>\n This book outlines two uses of language. It outlines how language can be used to achieve effective communication; this is contrasted with how language can be used to help maintain power and prestige in society. The former is a description of how language is used; the latter is a catalogue of prescribed rules based on attitudes. \n Language development is part and parcel of a child 's socialization. What a child learns instinctively is the basic rules described by linguistic analysis. He may be introduced to notions of 'bad' language, but this will have only a superficial effect. The need to communicate is infinitely more important, so he grasps the grammar and builds his vocabulary. \n Social distinction is based on such aspects as wealth and formal education. Members of these classes can be recognized by the cues they signal, consciously or unconsciously, to others. Language is the vehicle for this communication; it is not only what is said and how it is said, but what is not said. For those who always use the standard English dialect there would be strict conformity to the grammar, vocabulary and accent associated with that dialect. Grammatical constructions such as: 'I seen him' would be avoided. Slang might be employed providing it supported the solidarity of that particular group. Useless words which fill gaps in sentences would probably be similar to phrases like: 'in my view' rather than phrases like 'ye know'. Other strategies might be avoiding features such as the 'double negative'. \n But if we look scientifically at linguistic behaviour, we see other dialects allow us to communiate just as effectively. When the word 'youse' is used the basic rules are applied; there is reference to the plural form. Slang and swearing are presented in sentences with correct grammar; 'Who gives a fuck?' This phrase has no symbol function (little or no meaning) but is has symptom and signal function; the emotional state of the speaker is transferred to the listener. So the rules are implicit; in any century there is diverse use of English, and the language is always changing. \n We must also remember that we use language differently in different social contexts. Sociolinguistics gives us a complete model of language use; besides grammar and vocabulary, there is register and style. In a formal situation we are more rigid in our application of grammar, more careful in our choice of words. If we are performing as a member of a profession, we may use words which we regard as appropriate and significant. This use of register may make them feel excluded by what they regard as jargon. Style is a heading for the appropriate use of various forms of languge use. A performer can move to and fro along a spectrum; at one end of this spectrum is highly formal, at the other end is highly informal. So writing an essay and talking to a friend require different styles of language use. We may feel someone is moving closer to us if they include more slang and swearing. We can still use the dialect of standard English (spoken with the accent of another dialect) to swear or employ the language of an 'expert'. So a strange sounding dialect, which uses slang and swearing, can communicate much more than a verbose speech which contains empty phrases such as 'Everything possible will be done'. \n Over the centuries the phonetic, semantic and grammatical aspects of language alter. But there always has been an effort to establish what is correct. Trudgill and Anderson describe studies which reveal the impact of geographical location and socio-economic variation. Here we move back from description to prescription; the emphasis is on how language reflects the structure of society itself. Linguistic variables such as saying 'ing' rather than 'in' at the end of a word are used to map out region and class. The upper class is numbered 1; the lowest socio-economic class is numbered 4. This is placed on the vertical axis. Class 4 shows the largest variation of dialect. Class 1 seeks to maintain standard English. But members of all classes are sensitive to received pronunciation, and most increase their efforts to say 'ing' rather than 'in' at the end of a word. But this 'correctness' is imposed by convention; it varies according to culture. In the U.S. will include 'r' after a vowel, in the U.K. the 'r' is dropped. So the highest socio-economic group in both countries have an opposing view of what is 'correct'. But we must not confuse socially significant signals regarding class with the real processes of language in everyday use. These notions of 'correct' language use are    arbitrary  . What matters is the successful communication of thought and feeling from one 's inner world out into a shared world. The fact that some features such as accent is deemed to be 'correct', perhaps reminds us of the old saying: 'money talks'. \n I agree with the arguments presented by Anderson and Trudgill. To view language use as correct only when standard English is observed is to be very narrow minded. Attitudes based on class distinction restrict our response to others; feeling and thought can be expressed powerfully in any dialect. Shakespeare used language that would certainly not be considered 'nice'. \n We will resist inevitable change in language if we put one dialect on a pedestal. We will resist contact with those who introduce new forms of language use; this is foolish arrogance; there are two hundred million speakers of English in America alone. The language can only become richer the more it is used. \n In schools a need to conform to a standard usage need not put aside respect for local dialect. The local alterations of grammar or vocabulary are not mistakes; these alterations are legitimate. Language does not belong to anyone. Even the language of the drug culture soon changes from private slang to words in everyday use: 'fix', 'high'. Words like    gallivant   which belongs to Ulster slang add colour and comedy to conversation. Those who look back to the rules of Latin, forget that it does not change because it is no longer used. We should not waste our energies saying: 'It is I'. We should use language to reach out, not hide behind verbosity. To take ourselves too seriously and pompously assume we know best about language use, is to live in a shrinking world. \n\n\n<$B>\n The acquisition of language is an extremely long, complex process \u00d0 one which most people go through and few can do without. \n Although the first real evidence of progress comes in the first year, when the child utters its first words, language development begins long before the child is able to speak. \n 0-8 weeks \n During this stage the child produces sounds which reflect discomfort or distress of some sort, such as crying (  reflexive  noises). Sucking, burping and other such sounds which are uttered because of bodily functioning are known as  vegetative  noises. These sounds share some of the features found in later speech: vocal folds are used, an air stream mechanism produces the noise and there is rhymical vocalization. \n 8-20 weeks \n At this point the child has begun to laugh and coo. Cooing sounds are strung together sometimes producing syllables very like those in proper speech. During this time children learn to use the tongue and lips in co-ordination with the vocal folds and this is essential training for later speech. \n 25-50 weeks \n During the early weeks of this stage, a small set of sounds are used frequently and repetitively to produce sounds like 'ga-ga', known as  reduplicative babbling.  This develops into  variegated babbling,  with shifts between consonants and vowels. Rhythm and syllable length begin increasingly to resemble that of later speech. These utterances have no meaning, although they may seem to, but they are essential of the child 's mastery of sounds necessary for speech production. \n 9-18 months \n Sounds produced by the child are more varied that they previously were and are known as  melodic utterances.  Often parents can infer meaning from these utterances and there is at this stage no doubt that the    child 's   language skills are really developing. \n A perception of speech is necessary before the child can begin to speak itself, and it is surprising how highly developed this perception is. Even new-born babies have impressive auditory abilities and by four weeks they can clearly distinguish between different sounds. Babies also develop comprehension abilities extremely quickly, being able to respond to differing tones of voice from around 2 months, and understanding as many as 60 words by the end of their first year. (H. Benedict, 1979) \n Another factor important in child language acquisition is the influence of    its   mother. Mothers talk to their children from the moment they are born even though the child can obviously not yet speak. As the transcripts in Appendix 2 show, mothers pick up on all their children 's utterances in an an attempt to make some kind of conversation. This, importantly fosters in the child an awareness of what exactly a conversation is, and how to take part in one. \n We can break the development of language and communication skills into several areas: \n PHONOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT \n Even around the age of one, when children are able to recognise certain words, they have difficulty in pronouncing those words themselves. This ability develops gradually. Consonants are more easily pronounced when they are at the beginning of words rather than at the end, and some are more easily pronounced than others. For example, [p] [b] [k] [n] [f] [d] [g] [m] and [h] are common as beginning for words by the end of the second year but only [p] [b] [k] [n] and [f] are easily used as word endings. Usually by the age of four, all vowels and diphthongs and almost all consonants can be pronounced correctly. Often when children are unable to pronounce a word correctly, they reduplicate sounds which the are able to make, forming an approximation of the word. 'Bottle' might become [bubu] and 'water' may be pronounced [wowa]. It is likely that reduplication helps children learn to pronounce in stages and to express meaning by pronouncing the most prominent phones or 'sound units'. Around 1, children begin learning the correct use of intonation, a process which is not finished even when the child is in    its   teens. In the first year, intonation might be used to express such states as surprise, fear and greeting, and in following years more complex uses are learned. Appendix 1(a) illustrates the anxious attempt of a child trying desperately to make himself understood through intonation, since he is unable to do so with his limited vocabulary. \n GRAMMATICAL DEVELOPMENT \n Between 12 and 18 months, children are usually able only to form one word utterances, although these can function almost as sentences. Admittedly, some phrases are known, but the child will think of these as only one word and they should not be viewed as being proper sentences. Single word utterances can function as sentences because of intonation and gesture \u00d0 they have no real grammatical form. \n Around 18 months children begin to grasp morphological aspects of grammar such as word-endings. This ability develops considerably over the next two years, but as Appendix 1 shows, even a four year old can have problems with tense and other morphologies. Children begin to string two word sentences together at about 18 months, and although these are often ungrammatical, they can nevertheless convey a considerable amount of meaning. Sentences comprising several words emerge around the age of three, the child begins to learn the complexities of grammatical structure and to form sentences contining more than one clause. By four years, the child is surprisingly competent with grammar, and by ten, even most subtle grammatical rules have been mastered. The two year old in Appendix 1(c) is unable to use the past tense, but the four year old in 1(d) is quite competent, although still prone to such mistakes as 'Father Christmas bring bringed us our toys'. That these mistakes are made is not surprising: tenses do not always follow regular rules. \n SEMANTIC DEVELOPMENT \n Young children learn vocabulary with amazing rapidity but the ability to actually pronounce vocabulary lags behind the ability to comprehend it. By 18 months, most children understand around 250 words, but only have the capacity to say about 50 words. Six months later, spoken vocabulary exceeds 200 words. Once children reach the age of four, it become increasingly difficult to measure their vocabulary because of the incredibly rapid lexical expansion which takes place around the age of three. Even when a child uses a word grammatically, it may not fully understand    its   meaning. 'If', 'so', 'because', 'should', 'since' and other clauses cause a lot of problems. Only at about six years to children gain the ability to comprehend those subtle aspects of language whose meaning is implicit rather than explicit. \n PRAGMATIC DEVELOPMENT \n As well as knowing how to speak, children must learn the conversational skills necessary for social interaction. These abilities begin to develop at around two years of age, and by three children are starting to take into account their    listeners'   needs for clarity and the chance to participate fully in a conversation. They also become aware of appropriate responses Between three and five, children learn to use polite language such as 'please' and 'thankyou', 'Mr' and 'Mrs'. Their skills at initiating and sustaining conversations, as well as manipulating them, also expand. \n As this essay has shown, there is more to acquiring language than meets the eye (or ear), although we all take it for granted. For most, the learning process develops naturally and rapidly. Schools and observation of    others '   language play a high part in learning, but no learning would take place were it not for the innate ability for form a lingual system of communication. It is certain though that all would agree that child language acquisition is a fascinating phenomenon, and one which brings a great deal of enjoyment to all who observe it.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ecb6a823-fedc-4827-bc37-bd54ed21cc8c", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.515112+00:00"}
{"text": "<Learning strategies>\n\n\n<$A>\n  THE CONCEPT OF HUMAN LEARNING  \n The term 'learning' is a scientific construction based on observations of behaviour in repeated situations. The Oxford dictionary defines learning as  \"getting knowledge of, or skill in, by study and/or experience\" , whilst the Encyclopedia    Britannica   defines the term as  \"the alteration of an individual 's behaviour as the result of experience\" . \n Borger and Seaborne (1996) define learning as  \"any more or less permanent change of behaviour which is the result of experience\" , as they contend that  \"to consider learning is to consider how the interaction between an individual and his environment brings about changes in the way in which he tends to behave\" . Piaget (1969) explains learning as  \"involving adaptation to the environment and organisation of experience by means of action, memory, perceptions and other kinds of mental activities , whilst Gagn&/e (1967) defines learning as  \"a change in human disposition of capability which can be retained and which is not simply ascribable to the process of growth\" . He qualifies his definition by explaining that the kind of change called learning exhibits itself as a change in behaviour, and the inference of learning is made by comparing what behaviour was possible before the individual was placed in a  \"learning situation\"  and what behaviour can be exhibited after such treatment. This change he contends, must have more than momentary permanence. It must be capable of being retained over some period of time and it must be distinguishable from the kind of change that is attributable to growth, such as a change in height or the development of muscles through exercise. \n Hilgard and Atkinson (1975) also contend that as not all behavioural changes are caused by learning, any definition of learning must exclude such changes. Thus they define learning as  \"a relatively permanent change in human behaviour that occurs as the result of prior experience\" . They explain that the phrase  \"relatively permanent\"  excludes changes in behaviour that result from temporary or transient conditions such as fatigue or the influence of drugs. Also, by specifying that learning is the result of \"experience\", they too are excluding behavioural changes that are due to maturation, disease, or physical damage. \n Boyd, Apps et al (1980) in their deliberations about the concept of learning draw a definite distinction between education and learning. They contend that the term \"education\" emphasises the educator, the agent of change who presents stimuli and reinforcement for learning and designs activities to induce change, whilst in contrast the term \"learning\" emphasises the person in whom the change occurs or is expected to occur. They define learning as  \"the act or process by which behavioural change, knowledge, skills, and attitudes are acquired\" . \n On the other hand, Smith (1982) suggest that the term \"learning\" defies precise definition because it is put to multiple uses. This is because, he argues, that the term \"learning\" is used to refer to (1) the acquisition and mastery of what is already known about something, (2) the extension and clarification of meaning of one 's experience, or (3) an organised, intentional process of testing ideas relevant to problems. In other words, the concept of learning is as he states,  \"used to describe a product, a process, or a function\" . \n Thus although the problem of defining what the concept of learning is, has been the source of much discussion in the literature, it would appear that there exists agreement that the one basic requirement of learning is that some \"change\" must take place within the individual, with a learning skill being a way of organising and co-ordinating learning activity so that there is a retained change in the individual. \n It would, however, be tempting to think that all one needed to do to turn people into skilled learners would be to identify the skills, ways, decisions and experiences needed and then tell the students about them. But that is not the way one learns a skill, for, as Downs and Perry (1984) state  \"being told about welding does not produce a skilled welder, as practice in welding with feedback is vital for the skill to develop.\"     Similarly  , if we want someone to improve their learning skills then they must practise and get feedback on their skills. This can only take place through continual learning and feedback and reflection on both what is learned and how it is learned. In addition, if as Borger and Seabourne (1966) state  \"to consider learning is to consider how the interaction between an individual and his environment brings about changes in the way in which he tends to behave,\"  then it would appear important for the teacher to be aware of the previously experienced learning strategies to which his or her students have been accustomed, as their expectation of the learning event will be influenced by the way in which experience has made him or her capable to respond to a learning stimulus. Thus, later in this study, I would propose to examine if in relation to student nurses, an understanding of their expectations of the learning event by the nurse teacher, would enable him or her to shape the specific behaviour of such students, whose maturity, previously attained level of knowledge, and past experience of organising their interactions with the environment will influence their expectations of any learning situation. \n  THE CONCEPT OF ADULT LEARNING  \n The concept of adult learning, which Elsdon (1975) describes as  \"a movement from the familiar into the unfamiliar, a step in the dark which requires courage\"  is not a new phenomenon, since man has had to learn to adapt continually to changing environments in order to survive. However, as McCrea (1988) argues, the concept of the learning process which changes the adult 's way of responding as a result of environmental experience has changed over time as new learning needs emerged and studies of adult learning provided new knowledge of the processes of adult learning. \n Piaget (1969) stated that  \"the principal goal of education is to create men capable of doing new things, not simply repeating what other generations have done\" . Although, at the time Piaget was referring to the education of children, this quotation would be applicable to the adult learning situation, in so far as the object of adult education involves learning in the context of accumulated experience, skill, knowledge, opinions and prejudices, and building on these foundations, in addition to assisting mature people to change, accept new knowledge and learn to cope with a changing environment. For, although the adult student 's learning experiences will be at least partly coloured by his or her school experience, there are differences between the adult student and the school pupil in relation to the learning situation. For example, the former will no longer accept imposed discipline as a child will and is therefore more likely to become vocal if the depths of poor learning circumstances are analysed. \n In addition, in contrast to the child who is bound by law to go to school, the adult 's motivation for learning will be varied. Consequently, in the adult learning environment, a teacher faced with a class of mixed standards and interests may have little time for a depth analysis of motivation. However, Jones (1969) contends that in the concept of adult learning, what is much more important than a depth-analysis of motivation is the student 's self concept in the class. He, therefore, argues that the teacher should be aware of the picture that the student has in his own mind of what he is doing there, what he expects of the teacher, of the subject and of the other students, and how he relates his attendance at class with all his other concerns and responsibilities. \n That students have the ability to learn has never been denied, although it has been said that learning is mainly undertaken in childhood and that the ability to learn, and therefore intelligence, decline as the adult ages. But as research has shown in recent years the age limit on learning performance may not occur before 75 years (Cross 1979). New concerns in the concept of lifelong learning have emerged as research on adult learning and development have become more well-known. These findings have relevance for the learning potential of student nurses. Research has shown, for example, Cross (1981), that adult learning and the methods by which adults learn are quite distinct from those that have been developed to date for the education of children but which have also been used in the education of adults. \n Consequently, the art and science of helping adults to learn, termed Andragogy, and which Birchenhall (1985) informs one is defined by Meizrow (1983) as  \"an organised and sustained effort to assist adults to learn in a way that enhances their capability to function as self directed learners\" , is a topic which has received in recent years considerable scientific investigation. I would now like to comment upon this in relation to its relevance regarding the concept of adult learning. \n  THE THEORY OF ANDRAGOGY  \n McCrea (1988) reminds one that the term andragogy first appeared in the literature in 1833 and was used to refer to the normal natural process of lifelong learning for adults. Unfortunately, however, it was not until the late 1950's that writers on adult learning (Kidd 1959: Millar 1964: Knowles 1970) began to look critically at adult learning and to develop a theory of andragogy. \n Knowles (1970), who defined andragogy as the art and science of helping adults to learn, cited four major characteristics relevant to andragogy, namely, self concept, experience, readiness to learn and orientation to learning. Tibbles (1977) highlights how an examination of these four characteristics in adult learners would indicate that they are qualitatively different from those in child learners on which traditional pedagogy is based. \n The first characteristic is the difference in self concept. In contrast to children who tend to see themselves as dependent persons, adults perceive themselves as responsible self-directing individuals. As Knowles (1970) states  \"adulthood is the point at which an individual comes to see himself as being essentially self-directing\" . Thus, an adult who views him or herself as being self-directing, and has, a need to be treated with respect, make his or her own decisions, and as Tibbles (1977) states,  \"be seen as an important and unique individual\" . Self-concept is therefore, concerned with the greater independence of adults. This implies that learning situations should ideally allow for as much participation by learners as possible and suggests that if adults are placed in learning situations that do not incorporate their learning needs, they may resist learning. \n The second characteristic is experience. Knowles (1970) argues that as individuals mature they accumulate an expanding reservoir of experience that becomes an increasingly rich resource for learning and at the same time provides them with a broadening base to which to relate new learnings. Experience is therefore, particularly significant with regard to adult learners because of the amount and variety of previous experience gained. This implies, however, that transmission techniques of traditional teaching should be replaced by    experiential   techniques which tap the experience of learners and involve them in analysing their experiences (McCrea 1988). In addition, this experience can also contribute to the learning of others, a factor highlighted by Cooper (1972), who from her study of the adult nurse learners ascertained that  \"nurses need to learn to respect each other 's knowledge and skills so that they can take advantage of this rich resource as they continue to learn\" . \n The third characteristic is readiness. Readiness is concerned with the timing of learning, that is, adults are ready to learn material relevant to their life situation. In contrast to children whose readiness to learn is related to both biological development and social pressures, adults develop their readiness to learn as a result of the requirements of their various social roles. Consequently, adult learners will display a variety of stages and demonstrate a diversity of readiness, depending on the relationship between their past experiences and new ideas, or what Cooper (1972) describes as their  \"points of contact\" . It is therefore crucial that a particular learning experience meets the adult learner 's needs if his or her readiness to learn is to be maximised. To achieve this, the use of past experiences in relation to new ideas could be a useful technique, whilst grouping learners so that common requirements can be worked on together is another consideration. \n The fourth characteristic is orientation to learning. It is allied to two key factors, topic and time, by relating to a change in time perspective from one of postponed application of knowledge to immediacy of application, resulting in an orientation towards learning shifting from subject centred to problem centred. In contrast to children, adults focus more on problems than on subject matter and desire immediacy of application rather than a reference to the future. It is, however, necessary to point out that according to Tibbles (1977) there is now evidence that this is not invariably the case. Nonetheless, it is still considered that this perspective of postponed application in children has created an orientation towards subject-centred learning, and in adults the time perspective of immediacy has produced a problem-centredness towards learning.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "48c87587-df7d-4006-9c2c-ac3cc3c6b9e1", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.515485+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A>\n\n\n<$A>\n  Informing Consultation and Placation  \n While aspects of the Department 's approach could put it on the bottom two rungs of the ladder, the author contends it sits more comfortably on the next three rungs of Arnstein 's Ladder; they are considered collectively as the  \"degrees of tokenism\"  i.e., Informing, Consultation and Placation. The Department would see itself as informing and consulting. The very fact that the Department grant-aided CTA to carry out a consultation exercise is evidence of some degree of initiative. Certainly it would consider that it does inform the citizen of his/her right to participate, but the author contends that this in the case of the BUAP 2001 was carried out very closely within the confines of the legislation, for example the time to respond at each stage of the process was kept to strictly. \n Placation is perhaps the most accurate rung of the ladder on which the DoE 's approach to consultation would sit. On this rung the planners seek advice from the citizens. Arnstein however makes the crucial point that how this advice is communicated and subsequently understood by the planners depends on the technical assistance available and the degree of organisation within the community to press for action. However assuming that the best expertise and technical assistance was available and community development was of an advanced level, this would still have its limitations. The community is still in a position where it is reacting in the best way it can to the plan but not actually creating it. \n The top three rungs of the ladder, certainly were not achieved in the community 's response to the BUAP 2001. It is not certain that the DoE would even attempt to go this far up the ladder of participation. Curiously enough \"partnerships\" are an approach being put forward by the DoE currently in a bid to tackle inner city regeneration. It is an idea, similar to the inner city initiatives, borrowed from America. The Department defines partnerships as public and private interests coming together to tackle projects. What this very often turns out to be in practice is the Department of the Environment working with private developers and local councils. However it is contended by the author that although local councillors are democratically elected their diminished powers and the political conflict in Northern Ireland make the public perceive their councillors mainly as party politicians and not the providers of specific public services. Most people vote for different shades of nationalism or loyalism. So called  \"bread and butter issues\"  rarely feature prominently in the politics of Northern Ireland despite the dreadful economic situation. Because of these realities it is questionable just how representative these partnerships really are. \n In Britain on the other hand one of the fundamental barriers which the idea of public participation runs up against is its possible impact on the revered system of democratically elected local politicians backed up by their professional advisors. There is a very definite point beyond which it is deemed dangerous or unwise to allow public participation to stray. This is highlighted in many studies where a threat to the power of elected councillors is not welcomed. This is even the case with those who tend to support a more open participatory democracy type view on the issue. It seems the 'holy cow' of the democratic system must not be tampered with and public participation is only useful in that it may help keep local councillors informed about grassroots feelings within their constituencies and thereby aid in the flow of information, dialogue, debate, etc. without the danger of threatening the system itself. It can help as a lubricant to the system allowing those dissatisfied an opportunity to voice their opposition in a contained and controlled manner. This all depends however upon the degree to which the citizen can trust the local authority or the Council to represent their views accurately. In the Northern Ireland situation, it is clear that powers were taken from councillors because they abused them and discriminated against certain sections of the population. \n CTA to an extent acted essentially as a medium, pulling together views from all parts of the city; however it is non-political and its philosophy is one of working with groups rather than for them. To take a simple example of this, two surveys recently carried out by CTA in the Lower Ravenhill Road and the Lower Ormeau Road areas not only recruited, trained and paid people from the area to carry out interviews but also involved them in the drafting of questionnaires and forming    an   advisory group to consider any problems which might arise during the survey and report writing stages of the project. Also during the response to the BUAP 2001 CTA involved the groups at all stages of the process unlike other planning consultants who go away and come back later with the proofs of evidence. Sometimes this is exactly what their clients want. However the concerns of community groups are very often more complex than for example a private developer 's case which may be simply  \"I want that piece of land to develop houses to make a profit\" . The issues community groups are concerned with will often touch on policy, for example the amount of open space provision per head of population, the type of open space, where it is located, how the public gets to it and who can use it. \n  FREIRE  \n  Conquest  \n Moving onto Freire 's more structural analysis of power, while conquest may seem an extreme position, certainly in a broad political sense it is clear that some political parties and their supporters in Northern Ireland, most notably Sinn Fein, believe that the British continue to occupy six out of the nine counties of Ulster as an imperial colony. Shades of different political parties will manifest themselves in the attitudes of community groups, but often not in an overtly party political fashion. \n  Divide and Rule  \n The Divide and Rule perspective is perhaps more easily identified with parts of the community on both sides of the political divide. The political differences in Northern Ireland leave it wide open for this type of approach. Belfast is carved up into black spots, \"West\" Belfast is an entity in itself conjuring up to many a deprived, violent, nationalist area, (though part of it is loyalist) a breeding ground for terrorists and so on. Inner North Belfast is known in the press as \"murder triangle\". Virtually the whole city is divided up along sectarian lines with the exception of some middle class suburban areas. \n Despite this, the process of bringing together both sides of the community in the response to the Belfast Urban Area Plan 2001 was largely successful. It was perhaps the sense of the small citizen against the might of the state that held them together. The centralisation of the DoE as the decision-making body also brought unity to disparate communities. If planning was administered by local councils it would be much more open to manipulation and decisions could possibly be made according to party politics rather than planning arguments. It was also the strategic nature of the plan that made it easier to agree to lend support to different viewpoints. Land use zonings were confined to the periphery. \n However in the process of drawing up the Belfast Urban Area Plan 2001 there was a very clear case of Freire 's divide and rule approach regarding a specific road proposal. This was because the consequences of this particular proposal could be easily imagined at a local level. The DoE proposed to widen the Lower Ormeau Road, which would have affected a working-class Catholic community. A clear alternative to this road proposal was to widen the Lower Ravenhill Road, which ran parallel to the Lower Ormeau and it was a predominantly working-class Protestant community. Both sides of the community had come together to jointly oppose any road-widening which they both saw as a traffic measure designed to get rich people from the suburbs into work and home again a few minutes earlier each day. The DoE, wittingly or unwittingly, informed the Lower Ravenhill community that the Lower Ormeau community had suggested widening the Ravenhill Road. Both communities saw this as an attempt to buy off their mutual support in their opposition to the road-widening. \n It was not anticipated by the DoE that both groups would have had any links or lines of effective communication, much less an agreed position on the road proposal issue. This particular attempt at divide and rule fell foul of good community development in both areas as a result of the BUAP consultation exercise. It is not difficult to imagine how easily the authorities could subtly and successfully manipulate certain situations in order to force groups apart to then allow government itself to step in, in the guise of mediator between two combatants. \n  Cultural Invasion  \n Cultural Invasion persisted throughout the consultation procedure in the BUAP 2001 in terms of professional culture versus lay person 's culture. CTA initially attempted to persuade the DoE to look at alternative methods of consultation, to bring the debate to a common denominator which everyone understood. However the consultation proceeded in the conventional manner. What CTA was forced to do was meet the DoE on its own terms and adopt an advocacy approach. The community involvement still went through a professional medium, i.e., CTA, so ultimately Citizen Power or Cultural Synthesis by definition could not be achieved. The Inquiry was filled with legal professionals representing clients, who in many cases seemed to behave more like actors displaying mock dismay and outrage at evidence presented by the people. At times it was more like a Royal Shakespeare Company performance. Consultants from \"across the water\" all male and grey-suited wielded mobile phones and created around themselves an aura of self importance and intimidated groups, many of whom had just come from poorly equipped, fusty community centres. \n There was also a notable difference in for example how the Planning Appeals Commissioners reacted to different objectors. The degree of 'respect' and tolerance shown to particular eminent QC's when representing a case for private developers to have housing zonings altered was noteworthy. It would not be unfair to say that on occasion the PAC 's tolerance seemed to have its roots in fear of rebuke should they intervene rather than a belief that the points being made were valuable or even valid. By contrast on a few occasions the PAC 's attitude to some objectors lacking the high profile legal back up was consciously or unconsciously quite dismissive and rather patronising. \n The suits, the language, the ambience when examined clinically is really rather primitive. It is there to maintain differentials between the professional and the lay person. It parallels the structures and regalia adopted by many hierarchical tribal societies. If a medium which everyone understands can be used, why not use it? \n  Co-operation, Unity for Liberation, Organisation and Cultural Synthesis  \n This points towards Freire 's dialogical theory of action, made up of four elements, co-operation, unity for liberation, organisation and cultural synthesis. The diverse groups which came together to respond to the BUAP 2001 did have the vision that through uniting they were more likely to gain strength against the might of the government. In that sense, they recognised that two separate cultures shared a common \"oppressor\" \u00d0 a centralised government body making decisions about their environment. However, the particular situation of Northern Ireland is more complicated because of the political situation. The government from one perspective is the oppressor and from another perspective one community is the oppressor of the other and vice versa. \n The cultural synthesis perspective, with the idea of the leader responding to the people 's demands and not imposing her or his culture, while maintaining a view of the broader structural problems, would be a difficult situation to achieve. The two communities often identify totally diverse problems and correspondingly have very different demands, often directly in conflict with the other community.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "cc21a505-f1db-422b-a37c-77dbcd370102", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.516206+00:00"}
{"text": "<Irish peatlands>\n\n\n<$A>\n  MECHANICAL PEAT EXTRACTION  \n In general I found that most peatcutters were employing machinery to extract their fuel supply. In many cases in Northern Ireland machine cutting has occurred in areas which were previously cut by hand, especially as fuel prices in the mid 1970's led to an increase in extraction practices. Cruickshank and Tomlinson identify over 1000 instances of machine cutting on blanket bogs concentrated mostly in counties Tyrone and Fermanagh. I was introduced to several machine types including a Lilliput or \"sausage machine\", so called because it pushes the peat out in long cylindrical shapes, a bagger and a \"Hymac\", which resembles a dozen sleans all operating at once, cutting sods and turning them out to dry. Those individuals I spoke with in the Republic of Ireland usually did not own machines. They either hired one for a few days or were members of a turf co-operative. At Ballyhagan and Drehid, in Co. Kildare, individuals with turbary rights  1  forfeited these to the co-operative which organises machinery to cut the peat. Co-operative members pay a nominal fee for administration and then a further amount to the contractor. There had been complaints concerning the use of sausage machines in the Ballyhagan area which, according to one individual, had  \"upset the stability of the bog and produced poor quality fuel\".  Farmers in Galway said that after having cut peat with a \"sausage\" machine on just one occasion, the bog had been unable to support any other machinery for several years after. Similarly in Tyrone, peat cutters had abandoned this machine in favour of others. In South Connemara, a number of machines are put on loan to owners of bogs in the district. However, the individual hiring the machine must be able to guarantee a harvest worth at least <*> pound sign </*> 2,000. This had become quite a successful business for the machine owner. Often groups of bog owners came together to hire a machine, to cut and harvest their annual peat supply. \n Part of the report by Cruickshank and Tomlinson referred to above documents the extent of mechanical peat extraction on blanket bogs in Northern Ireland. The authors comment on the difficulties of distinguishing between commercial extraction and domestic extraction. Turbary rights which allow an individual to extract peat in a given area are defined in a confusing number of ways. In some cases the type of cutting is stipulated and in others turbary rights are extended for domestic and commercial use. Peat may be cut by machines for domestic purposes without planning permission and although commercial production does not require planning permission it is often difficult to prove that commercial extraction is being pursued. \n Those individuals I interviewed often had turbary rights which had been passed down for several generations. For them peat was an integral part of daily life and peat cutting an annual event. A few informants referred to the use of machinery in the bog, commenting that as technology has made advances elsewhere, so it was now the  \"turn of the bog\" . Some peat producers described peat extraction as a traditional activity made easier by machines. They explained that machines were capable of minimising their workload, for a peat extracting machine could produce in a day what would take a week to cut with a slean. Others referred to the diminishing labour resources in rural areas as young people migrated to the towns and cities. \n Numerous individuals engaged in peat extraction said that peat provided them with a convenient and comparatively inexpensive fuel which they thought should continue to be extracted as long as the need existed or until peatland resources were exhausted. \n As part of my assessment of individuals ' responses to peatlands, I distributed 250 questionnaires at random to homes in Armagh, Carrickfergus, Donegal and three suburbs of Belfast. Twenty-seven out of fifty distributed in Armagh were returned, sixty out of eighty were completed in Carrickfergus and thirty-nine of the 100 distributed in Belfast were collected. All twenty of those circulated in Donegal were completed and returned. Overall the rate of returns was approximately 58 <*> per cent sign </*> or 146 of the total number of questionnaires.  2  \n In distributing the questionnaires, various considerations were made. It was important that I gained responses from both urban and rural locations in order to assess the potential variation in the usage of peat by town and country residents, and variation in the perspectives held by individuals. Within the urban category there was a further differentiation between inner city residents and suburban residents. Inner city residents who completed the questionnaire lived in terrace housing with a small patch of garden or none at all, while suburban residents inhabited larger detached houses usually with one or two gardens. \n As I outlined above, most questionnaires were distributed in city and suburban areas - Belfast and Carrickfergus (180 of the total number) and the remainder were given to rural areas - Armagh and Donegal (70). I was interested to discover if there was a clear difference in the manner in which peat was used by urban and rural residents. I noted whether peat was used for fuel or gardening purposes, how much was used and if there was a variance in urban and rural perceptions. In selecting areas for the distribution of questionnaires, I was drawn simply to locations which were convenient in terms of access and distance. These areas also met the criteria for a diversity of housing and location types. The homes in urban areas which received questionnaires were chosen at random. I did not follow any predetermined pattern of selection. In rural areas, questionnaires were distributed to houses situated in the vicinity of peatlands in order to maximise the possibility of receiving at least some responses from individuals who cut peat themselves. In Donegal questionnaires were completed by individuals living along the North west coast, in the Gaeltacht or Irish speaking area, and in Armagh by residents of an area known as The Birches, near Portadown. \n The first of the three sections in the questionnaire addressed the consumption of fuel peat products. Sixty-two of the 146 respondents chose peat briquettes, and this included both urban and rural residents. Eighteen consumers bought machine cut peat and eight used peat extracted from their own plots, (all in Donegal and Armagh). Six respondents in Armagh and Donegal and two in Belfast stated that peat was their sole or main fuel. Peat was identified as a preferred fuel because of its smell, \"cheerfulness\" and convenience and because it gave a \"good heat\" and was easy to light. It seems the popularity of peat was due, in a large part to its multi-sensory appeal. From an analysis of the responses given, it was evident, that despite the considerable difference in the proportion of questionnaires distributed between urban and rural areas, peat was more widely used for fuel purposes in rural areas. \n  COMMERCIAL PEAT EXTRACTION  \n In order to gain a more detailed and accurate picture of commercial peat extraction in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland I contacted various peat producers and peat companies. The size of these companies varied quite considerably. Some comprised three or four  <-> man <->  men   and a peat-cutting machine, while others owned premises and employed a workforce of a dozen or more. The larger companies often had extraction projects on several sites and at least 50 employees. On first contacting companies, their immediate reactions were often tinged with suspicion. Some were reluctant to engage in any conversation regarding their operations and a few refused to be interviewed at all. I did however, manage to obtain interviews with several producers in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The following is a summary of an interview I conducted with a representative of the major peat producer in Ireland, Bord na Mona - the Irish Peat Development Board. \n  \"Established by the state in 1946 under the Turf Development Act, its primary aim has been to develop the country 's peatland resources for production. The company comprises three main divisions and separate profit centres with a number of subsidiary activities. The three core divisions are the Solid Fuel Division, Milled Peat Division and Horticultural Products Division. A fourth division has been established in recent years with environmental products. Research has been conducted by the company into the purifying properties of peat and a number of products have since been introduced to local and international markets. In early 1990, two pollution treatment products were launched, one to control pollutants in domestic sewage and the other to treat noxious odours. \n At present, Bord na M&/ona has fifteen administrative units and operations cover 80,000 hectares which is approximately 9 <*> per cent sign </*> of the total area of peatlands in the Republic of Ireland  3 . Current employment figures stand at around 2000 increasing to 3,500 or 4,000 during harvesting. Horticultural peat generates most sales supplying approximately 7,000 outlets. Despite declining fuel peat sales, peat briquettes accounted for 20 <*> per cent sign </*> of the company 's turnover (IR <*> pound sign </*> 23.5 million, 1990). As a low smoke product, briquettes have been accepted in some smokeless zones. A successful marketing campaign (1987-88) which sought to sell the atmosphere of an open fire also contributed to increasing the Board 's share of the market. \n As a state owned company, Bord na M&/ona has never had equity. Almost all the company 's capital has been provided by its major shareholder, the government. Bord na M&/ona is not a subsidised industry however, therefore its borrowings must be paid back. The acquisition of bogs in the aftermath of the oil crisis in the 1970's and decreasing energy prices in the 1980's has led to the company experiencing some considerable financial difficulties in the last few years (Anon. 1985). It has not made a substantial profit since the late 1970's, due in part to the enormous increase in borrowing. High interest payments mean that even in a good year profits are extremely low. \n Bord na M&/ona supplies the Electricity Supply Board (ESB) with fuel for its six generating stations in Counties Kildare, Longford, Mayo and Offaly. In 1989 over 3 million tonnes of peat were supplied to the ESB with sales for the period 1989-1990 totalling approximately IR <*> pound sign </*> 64.5 million. However, all ESB stations need reinvestment and one was scheduled for closure in 1990. After some thought, the government undertook to guarantee that it stays open for a further two to three years. It has acknowledged that fuel supplies to power stations will have to be considered in the future as an alternative fuel may have to be sought. \n Bord na M&/ona 's works locations are centred mostly in the Irish Midlands (Anon. 1983b). In June 1991, I visited several sites in counties Kildare and Offaly. One of these was Lullymore in County Kildare. These works consist of milled and sod peat production and a peat briquette factory. In latter years, sod peat production has dwindled somewhat and briquettes are now the main product. Situated in the middle of a vast expanse of brown peat fields which stretch for several miles there appeared to be little activity around the buildings or on the bog. The company stated that the factory was closed for 16 weeks for necessary maintenance. However local people informed me that it had been closed for a much longer period and that there had been  \"no life about the place at all\" . The area immediately surrounding the factory housed over twenty huge stockpiles of briquettes and an assortment of rusted and broken machinery and vehicles. A narrow gauge railway track ran from the factory through the peatlands to the main road. In places this was overgrown and damaged. Also on the site were three examples of the possible use of peatlands after exploitation. One area had been sown over and was now grassland, another was a small coniferous plantation and the third had become scrubland (Anon. 1983a). \n Plans by Bord na M&/ona to diversify in the area appeared to have been largely unsuccessful. Lullymore Nurseries located on a fringe area of the bog were closed and the stocks of shrubs which I could see were either dead or in poor health. A research centre in the area had been recently closed. Lullymore Lodge, situated on the edge of the bog had become home to a peat museum, several months before my visit. When I paid a visit to the museum I had to wait twenty minutes until a key was obtained and an official became available to show me the exhibits. From what I could ascertain, it seemed that the museum remained locked most of the time.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "65c1f2e9-b1fb-46a8-818c-1cc46a30d557", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.517141+00:00"}
{"text": "<Abortion law>\n\n\n<$A>\n  Introduction  \n Anthropologist, George Devereux has stated that  \"...abortion is an absolutely universal phenomenon.\"   1  It is a phenomenon which has sparked off one of the most contentious and durable debates in the history of law and ethics, because of the inherent gravity of the issues involved and the depth of feeling which it evokes. Attitudes to abortion are shaped, to a large extent, by the general  \"cultural climate\"  within which they are made - often reactions to the questions raised by the issue arise from    people 's   unconscious axioms and collective feelings, rather than from any entirely rational or conscious deliberation on the subject. Virtually every legal system in virtually every time has criminalized abortion in some very limited circumstances and allowed it in other circumstances. There is no absolutist legal system and no legal system with no regulation. Basically the means employed to deal with abortion depends on how the question is actually defined: is it a moral, social or political issue, and this is intrinsically linked with the society 's conception of the individual and the world. Petersen  2  suggests that it is possible to construct a typology which recognises three distinct models of abortion laws, all dealing with regulation in different ways: 1. The  Abortion Reform  model 2. The  Judicial model  , and 3. The  Elective  model. \n These models provide a useful means of comparative analysis and so, it is proposed in this paper to examine the abortion laws of three countries: England, Northern Ireland and Denmark, each of which corresponds to one. The three models will be outlined, followed by a description of the laws in the three countries. An analysis will ensue in which a comparative approach will be adopted, in order to assess the transferability of the law of abortion. Finally, some general conclusions will be drawn about the methods of regulation employed in the three jurisdictions examined, and what lessons can be learnt from the different experiences. \n  The Abortion Reform Model  \n In countries where abortion law corresponds to this model, original criminal statutes have been altered by legislatures to provide for lawful abortion when a medical practitioner honestly believes that justifiable grounds exist. This model preserves the essential right of medical practitioners to autonomy, however various conditions place some restriction on the clinical freedom of medical practitioners. As we shall see, the law in England is an example of the abortion reform mode. \n Abortion was largely dealt with by the ecclesiastical courts until the beginning of the nineteenth century when abortion after quickening became regarded as a common law offence.  3  In 1803 all abortion was criminalized with punishment for postquickening abortion being set at death. However, both the concept of quickening and punishment with death was eliminated from the abortion equation in 1838. The basis for these early laws is not clear.  4  \n The 1861  Offences Against the Persons Act  is taken by most writers as the staring point for the understanding of the modern law regarding abortion. Section 58 made it a statutory offence to procure a miscarriage by administering drugs or using instruments.  5  Section 59 made it an offence to supply or procure any poison or other noxious thing or any instrument or thing, knowing it is intended to be unlawfully used with intent to procure a miscarriage. The legislation which made a woman or a doctor potentially liable to life imprisonment for performing an abortion even when the woman 's life and health were threatened by continuing the pregnancy, resulted in many backstreet abortions and the loss of the lives of many potential mothers. In the 1920s, there were a series of cases where babies were strangled using the umbilical cords which still attached them to their mothers. Women and doctors were prosecuted for infanticide but acquitted because of a gap which existed in the law. This gap meant that it was possible to avoid criminal liability by killing a child in the course of normal birth but before it was fully born and the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929 was enacted to plug this  6  . A defence was provided by the Act if the act causing the death was done in good faith for the purpose only of preserving the life of the mother. The Act also contained a time limit: evidence that a woman had been pregnant for a period of 28 weeks or more, should be prima facie proof that the child was capable of being born alive and this was later read into the OAPA. \n However the availability of abortion was not as restricted in practice as it was on paper. The reason for this was the case of  R v Bourne   7  . Many doctors were unhappy with the state of the law regarding abortions and considered it too restrictive. \n Eventually one doctor, Aleck Bourne, a consultant obstetrician, performed an abortion on a fourteen year old victim of a brutal multiple rape committed by two soldiers. He then invited the police to arrest him and the Attorney General decided to prosecute. In his direction to the jury, MacNaghten J. advised that a broad interpretation as to the meaning of  \"preserving the life of the mother\"  should be adopted: \n Thus, explicit judicial approval was given to the exercise of medical discretion for therapeutic termination.  R v Bergmann and Ferguson   9  and  R v Newton and Stungo   10  clarified the position that, as long as the doctor acted in good faith, therapeutic abortion was legal. \n However, this did not eradicate the practice of backstreet abortions. The real desire to reduce backstreet abortions, thus reducing maternal mortality, by providing a more sympathetic system for women, was the main factor influencing the reform of abortion law which occurred in 1967 under the Abortion Act. Other influencing factors were the need to protect the autonomy of the medical profession and to stamp out the fear of prosecution, which existed even despite the fact that there was very little real risk of prosecution of a qualified medical practitioner who performed abortions, as long as he or she acted in conformity with recognized medical procedure. For the medical profession, the law remained both fragile and ambiguous: fragile in that the  Bourne  decision was made in a lower court and so could be overruled, and ambiguous in that the criteria of  \"good faith\"  and  \"honest opinion\"  were tenuously subjective. \n The Abortion Act 1967, received royal assent after a series of attempts to change the law. It was decided that the best strategy for getting the private members bill through Parliament would be to stitch new law on to existing law. Thus the Act took as its starting point, the defences to the 1861 Act and reiterated the time limit of the 1929 Act. The Act is considered to provide four grounds for legal abortion - where there is: 1. a risk to the life of the woman 2. a risk to the physical or mental health of the woman 3. a risk of injury to the physical or mental health of existing children of the woman 4. substantial risk of serious handicap \n The third ground provides the most room for manoeuvre - Feldman states that  \"the freedom given to doctors to take account of environmental matters gave a discretion to allow something like abortion on demand\" .  11  The Abortion Act has been amended by the  Human Fertilization and Embryology Act  1990, section 5 of which established the Human Fertilization and Embryology authority to review information concerning embryos. The Act provides specific grounds for abortion, and these are set out in s.1 (1) (a), (b), (c), (d) and 1(4) of the act. 12  Abortions certified under s. 1(1)(a) must be carried out by the end of the 24  th  week of pregnancy. There is no time limit at all for abortions based on the other grounds - anti-abortionists ironically failed to prevent the House of Commons from removing the 28-week presumption in respect of handicapped foetuses, because they were so intent on reducing the limit for abortions under s.1(1)(a). \n The other sections are really only consolidations of the law as it stands - however the new section 1(d) is a significant liberalization of the law -: where there is a  \"substantial risk\"  of physical or mental abnormalities as to be  \"seriously handicapped\"  , an abortion will be permissible up to the point of birth. It is unclear what exactly is meant by  \"substantial risk\"  and what is more, further problems exist regarding the abnormalities which leave a child seriously handicapped. Grubb asks if an abortion would be justified if a baby is diagnosed as HIV positive in its mother 's womb, given that it will almost certainly be asymptomatic at birth. Pro-life observers allege that the reforms will allow terminations  \"for any reason at all, from harelip to hair colour.\"   13  As Douglas notes, it is regrettable that, by directing their opposition towards women attempting to obtain early abortions, anti-abortionists ended up by facilitating the enactment of a piece of legislation which, frankly, looks eugenic. \n However, it seems that although in theory abortions on the three grounds without a time limit could be performed up to the birth of the child, in practice a number of factors will minimize such cases and mean that little will change with regard to the incidence of abortion. Firstly, at present, the trend is towards earlier rather than later abortions. Most abortions are performed within the first twelve weeks of pregnancy and few are performed after eighteen weeks.  14  Also, the certifying doctor need only form the opinion  \"in good faith\"  that the matters set out exist. The Act does not require that they objectively do - honesty seems to be sufficient to satisfy the Act. Another factor is that the decision to perform the abortion is subject to the regulatory requirements under the Act, a private one between the doctor and patient. No other individual has standing prospectively to challenge the legality of abortion under English law. \n  Judicial Model  \n This model exists where courts have held abortion lawful if the accused performs and abortion in the honest belief that it is necessary in order to preserve the woman 's physical or mental health. A pragmatic approach is adopted in the interpretation of the criminal statutes. Northern Ireland abortion law, which is rarely discussed outside of NI itself, provides an example of the working of this type of model. \n Abortion has been characterised as the  \"big guilty secret of Northern Ireland\"   15 . Until 1967, the law in Northern Ireland regarding abortion was the same as that in England. However, as the legal organs of Government in England continued to develop and change the law there, the situation in Northern Ireland remained static because no such organs exist. In 1990, the British Parliament debated a series of reforms to the 1967 Abortion Act in England. One proposal was the extension of the Act to Northern Ireland, however, this was opposed by all the 16/17 Members of Parliament in the House of Commons who represent the constituencies within the province. It was also opposed by all the political parties there with the exception of Sinn Fein, which declared itself neutral on the issue. Eventually the reform was defeated by a ratio of two votes to one. \n In practice, the courts in Northern Ireland have said that abortion is legal under certain circumstances, however the problem is that doctors are so fearful of the uncertainty of the law that few are willing to carry out the operation, even with judicial support. This is clearly illustrated in the case of  Re K  16   which shall now be examined. \n The Northern Irish Health Board made an application to the court for its ward, K to travel outside Northern Ireland for an abortion. K was a 14 year old girl who lived with her father until his own ill-health and her unruliness meant that he was no longer able to care for her. She became subject to a Fit Person Order and, at the age of thirteen, became pregnant whilst in a children 's home. She wanted to have an abortion and threatened suicide if she was forced to carry the pregnancy to term. She reinforced the threat by cutting her wrists with broken glass, refusing food and punching her stomach in order to harm the foetus. A psychiatrist testified that there was a substantial risk of suicide if the pregnancy continues and his opinion was corroborated by that of two other doctors.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a29138de-859d-4948-ae17-edbb6955ed7f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.518109+00:00"}
{"text": "<Banshee narratives>\n\n\n<$A>\n Thus far, the only gender difference that has emerged is the frequency of abstracts which is explained by virtue of differences in the size of respective repertoires. What does emerge, however is the weaknesses in the Labovian framework. \n Firstly as Bennett (1986) points out,  \"it is difficult to decide on the boundaries of each narrative stage.\"  Labov (1972) acknowledges this to an extent, when he says that  some  orientation  may  be found at strategic    points   in the narrative and also that  some  evaluation  may  be found in various forms throughout the narrative. However, the elements of narratives as described by Labov (1972) are considered    to be   more or less, discrete units. The data    collected   shows that this is not always the case as it was often    difficult   to distinguish distinct boundaries between elements and embedding of eg orientation within complicating action etc was common. Perhaps this does not occur without a reason. As Bennett (1986) suggests, when the subject of narratives is controversial, the narrator wishes to appear as a reliable witness and scattering orientation throughout the whole narrative emphasises reliability. The man and woman both gave detailed orientations at the beginning of the narratives with great attention being paid to the description of circumstances and contexts. (see Results pg 34-36 and 50-52.) The subjects under discussion involved both tradition and belief with both informants,    regardless   of gender wanting to demonstrate their respective accuracy in recollecting past experiences. \n According to the Labovian framework (1972) narratives are organised around one central event i.e. the complicating action. However, within the data collected from the man and woman, it was frequently impossible to identify  one  single event that would answer Labov 's (1972:370) question -  \"Then what happened?\".  Many of the narratives can be more appropriately described as consisting of multiple events which are necessary for their coherence. (Peterson and McCabe 1983). The concept of only  one  central organising event simply does not work for all the narratives - it is too rigid. \n Another problem arose when analysing the narratives using the Labovian framework and that is, as Bennett (1986) points out - the analysis of narratives is subjective with different people applying the labels differently to the narratives. Indeed, the same analyst may often change the labels with successive examinations of the data. The subjectivity of the analysis makes it difficult to come to definite conclusions regarding the features of a narrative. \n A possible solution to, this problem would be to consider the elements of narratives as defined by Labov (1972) more flexibly in terms of  where  they are to be found in the narrative. The labels eg abstract, orientation etc are satisfactory but the concept of their having a  set  location within discrete sections of the narrative is not helpful. The proposed solution would mean, for example recognising several events as being central to the story instead of only one or for example orientation would not be restricted to the beginning of the narrative but the probability of it being found throughout the narrative would be incorporated into the analysis. \n No significant gender differences emerged in terms of elements of the narratives possibly because the man and woman involved attached equal significance to the description of contexts and circumstances, evaluation, etc. However, when the manner in which the elements are combined to produce a structural pattern is examined, significant differences emerged. \n   STRUCTURAL PATTERNS:   \n The structural patterns that ensue from the Labovian framework have been described by Peterson and McCabe (1983). (See Introduction pg 11-13.) The narratives collected from the man conform to these patterns eg the classic pattern as described by Labov (1972) begins with an orientation proceeds to the complicating action is suspended at the focus of evaluation before the resolution, finishes with the resolution and brings the listener back to the present time by means of the coda-this pattern was identified frequently in the man 's narratives - (see Results pg 44...) Labov 's analysis of narratives is based primarily on the narratives of males so it came as no surprise that the man 's narratives conformed to the Labovian framework. The question which then arose was: would the woman 's narratives also fit into the structural patterns? The answer is a resounding 'NO'. \n Bennett (1986) analysed narratives pertaining to matters of the supernatural and found that the structures of these narratives diverged from the Labovian framework. She claims that this is due to the fact that  <->  c ntroversial <->  controversial   and complex ideas were the subject of discussion. However, the subjects involved in Bennett 's (1986 and 1987) research were almost exclusively female. The narratives collected from the woman contain a significant number of Bennett-type features of oral narrative. If the woman 's narratives were to be forced into the Labovian model then they would be classified as Impoverished or Miscellaneous - or as Chronological pattern at best. This would only serve to confirm the myth created by the Labovian model that  \"women cannot tell stories and that what women do tell are not real stories.\"  (Kalcik 1975:7) What the results do confirm is the fact that women  do  tell stories using a different structure from that commonly studied. \n The man 's narratives are linear in form; ordered events progress from one to another to a high point and the consequences are successively related. Evaluation sections were identified and evaluative remarks found scattered throughout the narratives. The majority of the narratives were ended by  \"tying up the ends in a neat denouement\"  (Bennett 1986:417) \n The woman 's narratives, on the other hand can be described as circular in form. Instead of progressing in a Labovian fashion from one section to the next, the woman often related the key incident in the story first (See results pg 50.) Orientations in the man 's narratives are lengthy and detailed but the woman devotes  \"a disproportionately large amount of [her] story to describing circumstances and contexts.\"  (Bennett 1986:417.) This, according to Bennett functions as a means of providing  \"a network of facts that can be treated as evidence\"  (Bennett 1986:426.) \n Bennett (1986) also claims that when narratives are used to explain something which is controversial that narrators relate typical happenings as opposed to the unique event of the Labovian model - this is confirmed by the woman 's narratives. The events related concern usual happenings thereby enhancing credibility, by Bennett 's standards. A similar device described by Bennett (1986) is the addition of a second story to the first - this feature is also found in the woman 's narratives. \n Aspects of Bennett 's framework were also found in the man 's narratives eg some of his narratives contain disproportionately long orientations, the description of a typical happening and the addition of a second story - in fact at times it was difficult    to   decide where one of the man 's stories ended and another began. One feature of Bennett 's analysis found exclusively in the man 's narratives is a    manoeuvre   used by the narrator to prevent loss of face by committing him/herself to belief in something controversial. (see Results pg 54.) However, for the most part the man 's narratives conform to the Labovian framework. The presence of some of Bennett 's framework in the man 's narratives can be understood by the nature of the subject under discussion. Bennett (1986) demonstrated that when complex ideas or controversial issues are the subject of discussion, narratives diverge from the traditional model. However, despite the fact that the topics discussed by the narrators may have influenced their respective styles, an undeniable gender difference emerged - the man 's narratives differed from those of the woman significantly. A question for further research would be: do the features of Bennett 's analysis appear in women 's narratives of subjects other than the supernatural - where belief is not an issue? \n Where do the Bean Sidhe narratives fit in? Irrespective of gender differences of narrative structure and repertoire size, the narratives pertaining    to the   Bean Sidhe occupy a relatively marginal position in the entire corpus collected from each informant. Of the man 's thirty-eight narratives,  four  are about the Bean Sidhe. Of the woman 's ten narratives,  two  are devoted to the Bean Sidhe. This reflects the marginal position of the Bean Sidhe in Irish folklore as described by Buckley (1987). \n Perhaps the Bean Sidhe is a marginal figure because the events she is associated with are in themselves transitory. The moment between the end of life in the human world and the entry of the spirit, the soul or the energy described by the male informant, is a brief one and phenomena associated with this moment are accordingly brief. Even though the Bean Sidhe narratives occupy a marginal position in the corpus of material and even though they are much briefer than the other narratives, they are no less effective as recapitulations of past experience. Minami and McCabe (1991) demonstrated that brevity of narratives does not detract from  \"elegance of form.\"  (Minami and McCabe 1991:595) \n A prominent feature of the Bean Sidhe narratives (see Appendix 2) is their disproportionately lengthy and detailed orientations eg in the first Bean Sidhe narrative related by the man (see results pg 53) great attention is given to the setting of the time and persons involved. This attention to detail is also found in the woman 's narratives. (see Results pg 36) The differences in narrative structure found in the other narratives and previously discussed, persist in the Bean Sidhe narratives. \n According to Buckley (1987:103) the topic of the Bean Sidhe is a  \"narrow and limited\"  one. The material collected for this paper refutes this claim. A wealth of stories, opinions and beliefs were discovered pertaining to the Bean Sidhe but, unfortunately, given the scope of this    paper  , only a superficial analysis of the data collected was possible. Compressing features of the Bean Sidhe that emerged into distinctive feature matrices is valuable to an extent but compression implies loss of detail and unfortunately, the features that could not be included in a distinctive feature matrix were examined all too briefly. Further research into gender differences in perceptions of the Bean Sidhe would benefit from a more detailed analysis of responses received. \n Similarly, the narratives collected received a superficial analysis due to limitations of time and project length. The marginality of the Bean Sidhe was established and further research into Bean Sidhe narratives exclusively would provide greater insight into the role and function of the Supernatural Death Messenger in Irish society. \n A gender difference in the genre of personal narrative has long been recognised and is confirmed by the results of this paper. A suggestion for further research would be to study women 's personal narratives to identify patterns that exist as opposed to comparative studies which highlight the gender difference but do little to balance a  \"one-sided view of story-telling that results from collecting data chiefly from one half of the members of a society.\"  (Kalcik 1975:11). \n CONCLUSION: \n The two questions posed at the beginning of this paper:\n1:  Do gender differences exist in perceptions of the Bean Sidhe?\n2:  Do gender differences exist in the narrative structure pertaining to the subjects under discussion by the informants?\nhave been answered in the affirmative. Gender differences  do  exist in a number of beliefs about the Bean Sidhe and are explicable in the light of    the respective   roles of women and men in the society of the time. \n Gender differences  also  exist in narrative structures thereby confirming the finding that women tell stories in a way that differs from the traditional models of narrative structure that were based primarily on the narratives of men.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "07ea5bc1-8bf5-4295-bc4b-2014dab6d77e", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.519302+00:00"}
{"text": "<News images>\n\n\n<$A>\n  CHAPTER TWO  \n  2.0 Introduction  \n The Collins English dictionary defines communication as  'the imparting or exchange of information, ideas, or feelings' by 'speech, gesture, telecommunication systems, publishing and broadcast media'.  1   The words  imparting or exchanging  indicate that communication is not always a two-way process. It is important, therefore, to distinguish between two types of communication, reciprocal or non-reciprocal. Face to face interaction is the typical example of reciprocal  2  or collaborative  3  discourse. In this type of discourse, the role of speaker and interlocutor can change, and meaning can be clarified by indicating non-understanding or by asking questions. Cook says,  'the receiver can influence the development of what is being said'.  \n Mass Communication, such as the television news broadcast, is an example of non-reciprocal communication. The listener, viewer or reader are one of many who have very little opportunity to contribute (unless it is to make comments to the television which does not talk back!), or ask for clarification (and if they do, there is usually a time lapse, for example, radio phone-ins or letters to the editor). Yet, the people on television seem to talk to the viewers sitting at home in their armchairs, or when two people are seen having a conversation in a bar during the course of a soap opera, the viewer feels like a third party who is present. For this reason, many of the non-verbal cues which are important in interactive discourse (such as those which facilitate turn-taking) will still be relevant in a discussion of mass communication. \n There are many terms in circulation for describing the non-verbal elements of a communicative situation. 'Non-verbal' and 'non-linguistic' appear to be used interchangeably by Rost  4  and Abercrombie. Abercrombie reserves 'paralanguage' for those non-verbal elements which interact with the spoken language to produce a message. Not all non-verbal communication is paralinguistic according to him.  5  However, Crystal  6  limits the use of 'paralanguage' to vocal effects such as whispered speech which alters the tone of voice and subsequently the meaning of what has been said. Allan  7  divides non-verbal communication into vocal (accent, intonation and stress) and visual (gestures, proximity, appearance, setting, etc.). She also mentions that as appearance and setting are not part of interaction, they are often referred to as 'extralinguistic'. To avoid confusion,  extralinguistic  will henceforth be used to refer to setting, and appearance, etc., while  non-verbal  or  non-linguistic  will include gestures, proximity  and  extralinguistic elements. \n  2.1 Non-verbal communication  \n The types of non-verbal cues which shall be considered here are included in the field of semiotics. This is described by Crystal as follows:  8 \n This field investigates the structure of all possible sign systems, and the role these play in the way we create and perceive patters (or 'meanings') in sociocultural behaviour. The subject is all-inclusive, therefore, dealing with patterned human communication in all its modes (sound, sight, touch, smell and taste) and in all contexts (e.g. dance, film, politics, eating and clothing). \nSandor Hervey points to the controversy between linguistics and semiotics.  9  One theory advocates that linguistics is the parent discipline of semiotics which applies linguistic notions to communication outside natural languages. The other theory considers linguistic notions as specialised semiotic notions developed for describing natural languages. Birdwhistell  10  too refers to this conflict saying that in our culture devoted to literacy, we are tempted to think that words alone carry meaning and form the  'natural centre of the communicative universe and that all other modes of communication are to be studied as subsystems subordinate to it'.  Whether one mode of communication is superior to another is not the issue here. What is relevant, however, is that words are not only means by which we communicate. \n Birdwhistell 's work concerns research carried to try to develop a systematic classification of body motion in communication. Edward Hall 's seminal book on non-verbal communication,  The Silent Language,  11   illustrates the kinds of communication problems that can occur across cultures as a result of different interpretations of non-verbal phenomena. Laver and Hutcheson  12  discuss, among other issues, how non-verbal factors such as gesture and proximity are used in interaction strategies. According to Nancy Henley  13   our culture  'places great emphasis on verbal communication' and that 'non-verbal communication is learned informally as a matter of survival, just as language is learned before we enter school to study it'.  She examines the role of non-verbal communication as an expression of power in interpersonal relationships and in society as a whole. At this point, let us examine the different kinds of non-verbal communication which are possible. \n  2.2 Types of non-verbal communication  \n When we talk to somebody face to face, information is not exchanged by words alone, but also by our body movements and details of the situation in which we find ourselves. For example, it can be difficult to know exactly what a person means by the words 'what a day!' If the person utters this while heading for the nearest armchair, and then slumps down and proceeds to relax all his or her muscles, then we may take this to mean that it was a tiring or perhaps, stressful day. If, on the other hand, the person is uttering this while standing at the window with hands on hips and looking our at the cloudless blue sky, then we may assume that the person is referring to the beautiful weather that day. \n However, sometimes the non-verbal cues and the verbal message may be in conflict. For example, your friend tells you that she is not annoyed with you, but several factors in the situation lead you to believe otherwise; the toss of her head, her facial expression, her tone of voice and the fact that her favourite Waterford crystal glass, that you have just accidentally broken, is lying in pieces on the table, having first spilled a fine wine on her pristine white Irish linen table cloth! In a situation such as this, the non-verbal cues 'speak more loudly' than the verbal ones. (Or as Freud said of words, they hid more than they revealed).  14  \n Prosodic features such as intonation, pitch and stress are features produced in the vocal tract which are used to convey meaning. Their importance is acknowledged by the use of audio cassettes in the classroom to provide information that the written word alone can not provide.  15  While acknowledging their importance, they shall not be considered further here because they are common to both radio and television programmes. Although smells and tastes (olfactory and gustatory signs) can give valuable information, their function in human communication, unlike animal communication, is limited and of course, neither can be appreciated (even though they may be imagined) through video! \n  2.2.1 Visual - Kinesics  \n This refers to the role of body movement in communication and includes, facial expressions, eye contact, gestures and body posture.  16  \n The face can indicate a wide range of emotions, either consciously or subconsciously, presumably this is the reason why card players try to maintain a wooden countenance, hence the term 'poker face'. The direction and length of a person 's gaze can also convey information about emotions and attitudes. As discourse analysis has demonstrated, these elements are important in conversational strategies such as feedback and turn taking.  17  We often associate looking a person in the eye with sincerity. (Many politicians and people in the public sphere employ this technique on television and most telepromters are situated so as to enable the eye to keep this middle distance). However, not all cultures interpret eye contact in the same way.  18  \n Gestures may be learned or idiosyncratic. Learned gestures are movements which have deliberate communicative functions, for example, waving may be used to gain someone 's attention or to say good-bye. Nodding the head indicates affirmation (although apparently it is associated with negation in Bulgaria). Some examples of 'bad language' have an equivalent gesture which can either replace or reinforce the intended message. Idiosyncratic gestures are those which are often unconscious and although they may indicate a person 's state of mind, they are not systematic. \n Body posture, like facial expressions and eye contact can indicate states of mind such as interest or boredom. Body posture also functions in conversational strategies for the above reasons and for its use in turn taking, e.g. we may sit forward to indicate we want to take the next turn or sit back to let someone else have their turn. \n  2.2.2 Tactile - Proxemics  \n This refers to both bodily contact and distance between people. \n Bodily contact may be used to communicate feelings such as affection, aggression, or sexual attraction. Bodily contact may occur when we greet or take leave of someone.  19  \n Distance between people can also communicate information about their social relationships, whether they are close friends or colleagues and their relative status. Invasion of 'body space' can cause feelings of embarrassment or suspicion. Each culture has its norms concerning the distance common between people and variations can be misinterpreted.  20  \n Although it is important to explore the nature of non-verbal cues used in interaction, a detailed analysis of how people interpret gaze direction and gestures etc., is not within the scope of this thesis. Such an analysis requires training and the average person does not have this.  21  What is important is the fact that most people do make use of these albeit at a sub-conscious level and that is why it is so    important   to see one 's interlocutors when communicating. \n  2.2.3 Extralinguistic communication  \n There are also other elements in a communicative context which convey information, but which are not part of interaction in the way the others are. These are the extra linguistic elements of communication.  22  An important point should be made here, and that is the difference between denotative and connotative meaning. Words and objects have literal meanings (denotative), but also they often have connotations, that is, they suggest other things. On television, the screen may contain a host of different objects, many of which have been chosen to create a particular setting. Masterman  23  refers to the relationship between objects in a programme (that is the way they are combined) as its iconography and suggests that this relationship is a sign-system capable of being analysed just like non-verbal communication studies have done with people. \n Certain assumptions are often made regarding people based on their appearance. Masterman describes people as  'complex communication networks'  because clothes and hair style can reveal something about them. The importance of image and appearance is demonstrated most clearly by those in the public eye. When the unknown Diana Spencer became Princess Diana, her appearance changed too. Budding musicians and singers worry about the 'look' they are trying to get across. Politicians consult clothing consultants in order to suggest a positive image and gain more votes. \n Dress may be used to convey information regarding people 's nationality (the kilt), their religion (a nun 's habit), their job (a business suit or a workman 's overalls). Dress may also evoke a certain historical period. We associate different clothes with different activities; a bathrobe before or after a shower, pyjamas going to bed or getting up (or when the doctor visits!), sports gear. Masterman talks about the suits of the news readers which make them seem more credible and reliable. \n Hairstyles are often used in conjunction with the above to indicate a time factor. For example, the elaborate, powdered wigs worn by men and women in earlier times, the 1920's bob, the 40's roll or the 1960's beehive hairdo. \n We have certain expectations regarding the behaviour and language that will take place in certain settings, for instance, a court room, a class room, a shop, a sports field.  24  Certain types of 'architecture' can suggest different countries, for example, the wooden slats and front porch of a clapboard house can be enough to suggest the United States and red brick terraced houses may suggest a British city. Sometimes, it may be that a single building found in one of the cities in the country is so instantly recognisable that it is used to represent not only the city, but the country too. Famous examples would be the Eiffel Tower (France), the leaning tower of Pisa (Italy), the Sydney opera house (Australia), and the Taj Mahal (India).", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f65443b2-7a22-4d0b-829d-3003e0614dca", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.520245+00:00"}
{"text": "<Pragmatic development>\n\n\n<$A>\n   Chapter 4 The Development of Pragmatic Abilities in young children- Part 2: The social organisation of discourse\n4.1.  Introduction:   \n The preceding chapter examined how the young child learns to communicate intentions, and how he/she develops awareness of the listener 's needs in the communicative situation through the development of presuppositional abilities. How the child copes with the social organisation of discourse and thus learns to take part in conversations, is a further aspect of pragmatic development that warrants consideration. \n Awareness of discourse structure and involvement in conversational exchanges require the child to function both as a speaker and a listener, assuming the responsibilities of both roles. The child must therefore learn how to function in, and contribute to, such exchanges; he/she must learn how to initiate and maintain topics along with learning how to 'repair' breakdowns in the conversation should they occur. \n In addition, according to Grice 's Maxims (1975) abridged in Leech (1983), to be a successful conversationalist, it would appear that not only does the child have to learn to be co-operative in the conversation but he/she must also learn to make the contributions informative, relevant, truthful and unambiguous, while being appropriate to the situation and to the partner being spoken to. Implicit in the notion of co-operativeness is the ability to take turns. The development of turn-taking in children is an area that has been widely researched (e.g. Kaye, 1977; Ervin-Tripp 1979). It is to the development of the    ability to turn-take in conversation to which we now turn, before considering the other aspects involved in the development of discourse/conversational abilities. \n  4.2.\n Turn-Taking in Conversation:   \n It is a well established fact that young infants master the rudiments of    turn-taking   long before they use this skill as a conversational device. Early caregiver-infant interactions are typically characterised by turn-taking behaviour, as are the highly ritualised and repetitive games played within those dyads (Bruner 1983). Kaye (1977;89) reports a  'conversation-like'  organisation in infant feeding, comparing the burst-pause sequences of infant sucking to turn-taking sequences; though the activities are similar, a direct causal relationship seems remote (see Mc Shane 1980). Snow (1977) describes how mothers often refrain from talking during feeding sessions, especially when the infant has the bottle in his/her mouth, in effect refraining from talking when the infant is prevented from 'answering'. Snow concludes from her study of mother-infant dyads (infants aged 3-24 months), that even from the age of three months, mothers treated their infants as if they were partners in an adult-style conversation. The mothers regarded activities such as smiling, burping and vocalising as constituting the infants turn in the conversation and in so doing  'shaping'  the infants behaviour towards conversational participation (c.f. Ervin Tripp 1979). \n Francis (1990) comments that as a child is  'born a speaker into a world of speakers'  it is not surprising that they are treated as such at an early age. As the child grows the mothers or caregivers  'actively induct their infants into conversational participation by continually updating the demands that are made on the infant'  (Mc Shane 1980;67). They soon encourage the child to take his own turns and as Garvey (1984) comments this is probably the reason for the very high percentage of questions posed to young children. Children learn early on that a question requires a response and so they attempt to answer even with limited linguistic abilities. Furthermore if they are unable to respond to a proffered turn, children as young as three years may use a turn-holding device such as 'hmm?' or 'yeah', being aware of the obligation to take an offered turn. \n Overlapping in conversation, which leads to simultaneous talk, though a common occurrence in adult exchanges, rarely happens when children converse. Garvey (1984) reports only five percent of turns over-lapping in the young children she studied, which decreased to only four percent in older children. She concludes therefore that children observe and are aware of Sacks et al 's (1974)  'one-speaker-at-a-time'  conversational rule. \n That young children observe such constraints on turn-taking behaviour, implies that even young preschool children can take turns in an orderly fashion and by school age  'they seem to be following similar processes to adults as far as dyadic interactions are concerned'  (Mc Tear 1985a;200). That children 's turn taking skills are most effective in dyadic encounters has been further elaborated by Ervin-Tripp (1979), who sees it as being a result of older partners in a communication adapting the level of processing difficulty of their speech to suit their partner (c.f. early caregiver-infant formats). This modification on the part of the adult may not be so easily achieved in triadic or multi-party conversations. In conversations that involve more than two people, the child 's turn-taking abilities may prove inadequate. The young child may have difficulty waiting for his/her turn and oftentimes the child will resort to interrupting, in an attempt to take another 's turn, frequently offering a contribution that is often seen as irrelevant. That the child 's relevance constraints are weak at the early stages of conversational development, often leads to attempts at gaining a turn, being ignored, the child is therefore forced to yield the floor to another conversant. \n As Ervin-Tripp (1979) comments, 'relevance must be learned', though at the same time she concludes:   'it is much more evident in our data and perhaps to children that older or more powerful speakers will be listened to regardless of relevance'.  (Ervin-Tripp 1979;413) \nEvidence from the literature on language impairment offers further insights into the conversational turn-taking behaviour of children. However, as Johnston (1985) comments, because of the heterogeneity of language impaired groups it is difficult to make accurate or general conclusions as to the behaviour of these children in conversational exchanges. Such difficulties are represented in the conflicting views on turn-taking skills in such children. \n Fey <*> ampersand </*> Leonard (1983) offer an interesting insight into the problems of turn-taking in language impaired children, they state:\n  'a general impairment in comprehension of language form and content may result in the child's assumption of a relatively  passive role  in conversation'  \nThey imply, therefore that though the difficulties in taking turns is manifested pragmatically, the root of the difficulty could be traced to primarily a linguistic cause i.e. poor communication skills; if the child is unable to understand the content of the discourse it follows that he/she would be reluctant to join in. Adams <*> ampersand </*> Bishop (1989) found that violation of turn-taking rules was only a feature of  some   language impaired children when compared to normally speaking controls. Moreover, Craig <*> ampersand </*> Evans (1989) found that the turn-taking behaviour was  qualitatively different  than that of age-matched or language-matched controls. \n Blank, Gessner <*> ampersand </*> Esposito (1979), in their study of a three year old child whose speech and language skills were age appropriate but who had major problems in using language to communicate, comment that the child as an infant never engaged in the playful preverbal communication patterns so typical of parents and infants. Such games (e.g. peek-a-boo, pat-a-cake etc.) rely on co-operation and turn-taking to be successful. Whether there is a direct causal relationship between a reluctance to engage in such games and later conversational turn-taking difficulties is questionable. Crystal 's (1990) description of a  'pragmatically disordered'  child shows how the child tended to ignore his listener, and rarely engaged in any form of turn-taking behaviour. However, Mc Tear (1985b) found that turn-taking was not a problem in a young boy he described as presenting with a  'conversational disability'.  \n  4.3 \n  Conversational Initiation:  \n  'As far as conversation is concerned people frequently experience problems when they try to start up a conversation or gain access to one which is already underway'. \n(Mc Tear 1985a;75)    In the previous section on turn-taking a child 's difficulty in gaining access to a conversation, especially in multi-party talk, was discussed. In this section however, the focus is on how a child learns  to initiate  a conversation - an essential pragmatic skill if the child is to become a competent conversationalist. Mc Tear (1985a;75) defines initiations as  'referring to utterances which predict or set up expectations for responses'.  The usual devices used to initiate a conversation are the use of vocatives (e.g. calling a person's name); attention-getting words (e.g. 'hey, 'look', 'see') or the use of prosodic features (e.g. various intonation contours, increase in volume etc.). \n Like other aspects of pragmatic ability, it proves difficult to map the development of conversational initiations in children. However, in section 3.2. we saw that the child as young as nine months can attempt intentional initiations. However, Foster (1979) in Mc Tear (1985a) found that children 's early initiations predominantly involved  'self topics',  where the child would try to direct attention to himself/herself by crying; the adult would therefore have to find the appropriate response, and if successful the interaction could begin. Furthermore Foster found that such initiations were used (albeit infrequently) by even the youngest children in the sample studied (i.e. ages one month and five months); later development sees the child move from directing attention to objects in the physical environment (e.g. reaching behaviour at age five months) to pointing behaviour (e.g. at age one year and three months) and even later still to the use of attention directing words. \n Older children will often use a vocative and an attention getting word e.g.  'Mummy look!'  or merely use a vocative with a rising terminal intonation contour. If the former device is used, the listener often responds by saying 'yeah' or 'what', so giving the speaker (e.g. the child) the go ahead to proceed with the discourse now that mutual attention has been secured. A technique commonly used by three or four year olds is the initiation  'know what?'  and it gets a similar response pattern to that outlined above. Garvey (1984)    contrasts   the above with the younger child aged two-three years whose initiations are less sophisticated; children of this age tend to use what Garvey terms  'bare messages'  e.g.  'I 'm three    today   '   or  'This is my doll'.  Such attempts at initiation may often prove disconcerting to a stranger  'just because they (the children) have omitted a prior move designed to assume addressee availability'  (p.41). The child in the more    advanced   stages of communication development may use full sentences, for example,  'Do you remember that car we saw yesterday?'  to initiate an exchange. This more advanced form of initiation sees the child checking out the shared (or given) knowledge before proceeding in the discourse - a technique widely used by parents/caregivers in early communicative situations. \n From the language-impairment literature, we can conclude that the pragmatic ability of initiating conversations, seems to be one of the more difficult skills to acquire. Conti-Ramsden and Friel Patti (1983) found that non language impaired children were more inclined to initiate conversations than their language impaired counterparts of the same age. Likewise Fey <*> ampersand </*> Leonard (1983) found that specifically language impaired children  'may be markedly deficient as the initiators of social conversational interaction'.  Finally Conti-Ramsden <*> ampersand </*> Gunn (1986) in their case study of a  'conversationally disabled'  child, showed that the initiation devices such as those described above did not appear until the age of 5.2 - 5.7 years. \n In summary, therefore, though we can see stages in the development of conversational initiation, especially in the younger preverbal child, it is difficult to rank the various initiating devices in terms of their complexity and acquisition. Moreover again because of the heterogeneity of the language impaired group, it is not possible to make a general statement on the development of initiations in such children. \n  4.4. \n  Conversational Maintenance:   \n If initiating a conversational exchange is a difficult enough task for a child to achieve, maintaining the conversation, once initiated, also poses problems for the young communicator. As adults, the techniques we employ in our efforts to maintain conversations, include such techniques as answering questions asked or adding some new or further information to the topic being discussed. Verbal techniques may also include utterances like  'yeah', 'uh-huh', 'is that so?'  etc. (which can function also as turn-holding devices, as we saw earlier). Non-verbally we use head nods and facial expressions which should (but may not always) encourage the speaker to continue. Such devices are also known as  'Back-Channel Communication Devices'  and oftentimes adults use them unconsciously. Mc Tear (1985a) cites an example, taken from Sinclair <*> ampersand </*> Coulthard (1975), of how adults (in this case a teacher) maintain topics.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "3406453f-a26f-4de7-86b8-297131280cd0", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.521522+00:00"}
{"text": "<ASL syntax>\n\n\n<$A>\n   3 The Syntax of Space  \n 3.1 Spatial Organization - Nominal Loci and Verb Directionality  \n In so far as the production and recognition of visual patterns is dependent on spatial distinctions, it is of course trivially true that spatial organization constitutes one dimension of sign language, just as it is true that speech can be described in acoustic terms. The description of sign in terms of its use of space can thus proceed on what we might term the 'phonetic' level. But it is also the case that the spatial dimension can lay claim to significance on the syntactic level of explanation also - as indeed on the level of discourse, though this will not be our primary concern here. In this chapter I will attempt to provide a framework within which the analysis of 'spatial syntax' in HPSG terms might proceed. To begin with, I will look at the association of nominals with locations in signing space; following this I will explore the way in which certain verbs exploit this mechanism of 'spatial indexing'. \n Referring nominals in ASL are frequently associated with particular points, usually called  loci,  in signing space (Lillo-Martin and Klima 1990, Meier 1990, van Hoek 1992). The effect of this assignment of location is analogous to the assignment of abstract indices that is generally assumed in syntactic, and indeed discourse-oriented, accounts of reference and coreference: a locus is uniquely associated with the referent of the nominal, and this association may be exploited to refer anaphorically to the referent at any point in the succeeding discourse. In principle, there is no limit on the number of loci that may be established. A locus can be assigned to a referent in one of a number of ways (Lillo-Martin 1986). If the referent is an entity physically present, then that entity's actual location will, in general, function as its locus.  1  An entity not present in the signing situation may acquire a locus through being signed in a particular, arbitrary position on its first appearance in the discourse, or it may be signed in neutral space and then explicitly assigned a locus through pointing. Alternatively, the signer may gaze at the locus while making the relevant sign. \n Once established, a locus can be exploited referentially in a number of ways. Most obvious, perhaps, is the case of reported conversation; here, the signer commonly adopts the role of each of the participants in the reported conversation in turn. The role being played at a given moment is indicated by body orientation and gaze, and these parameters are determined by the loci assigned to the (absent) speaker and addressee.  2  Loci are also exploited in a way that is apparently analogous to pronominal reference in spoken language: this is achieved by pointing to the appropriate locus with the index finger. Meier (1990) points out that while it is clear that ASL has gestures which, in certain contexts, are best rendered in spoken languages as personal pronouns, it does not follow  necessarily  that these are in fact pronouns in the same sense, since the use of pointing to indicate reference in discourse is nearly universal in human communication but is not generally considered to be a linguistic phenomenon. However, Meier goes on to adduce evidence in support of the view that the pointing employed in ASL is linguistic in nature; among his arguments are the fact that deictic point-gestures are interspersed with unambiguously linguistic signs, and the fact that similar syntactic constraints apply to their distribution as to that of other signs. Finally, spatial loci also play an important role in designating the participants in the relation introduced by certain kinds of verbs, and in specifying their role in the relation. In this chapter I will be concerned with capturing the pronominal and verbal uses of space in ASL. \n  3.1.1 The ASL Pronominal System and Referential Indexing  \n One argument mitigating against the claim that ASL pointing signs are pronominal is that, since there is in principle no limit to the number of loci that may be established in signing-space, there must also be no limit to the number of pronouns that must be present in the lexicon. If we accept this, then we must accept that there is indeed a substantial qualitative difference between the pronominal system of ASL and that of any spoken language, since there is no known spoken language that has an open-ended inventory of pronouns. Now, it is certainly true that, if we accept ASL points as pronouns, we must also accept that each entity in a given discourse may receive a uniquely assigned pronominal form. The English pronominal system must be considered sadly impoverished by comparison; any number of individual male referents in a discourse, for example, must be content to share a single  he  among themselves. GB theory and HPSG share a belief, however, that this degenerate paradigm is the surface manifestation of an underlying abstract, but psychologically real system of reference-tracking that involves abstract entities called  indices.  These, like spatial loci in ASL, are uniquely assigned to referents, and must hence be assumed to be infinite in number, since an infinite number of distinct referents may in principle be referred to in a given discourse. In HPSG, as we have seen, it is assumed that part of the informational composition of indices are the parameters alluded to above, namely, person, number and gender (for English, at least). For Pollard and Sag (1994), these features serve simply to help distinguish indices from one another:\n Indices bear formal agreement features, in much the same way that pushpins employed by military strategists to represent army divisions might come in different colors to represent different countries.  (p.72) \nHence, the fact that there is a limited variety of pronouns in spoken languages is a consequence of the limitations imposed by the taxonomy of pronominal forms; pronominal agreement systems are multidimensional, but the set of possible classifications along each descriptive axis is nonetheless discrete and finite. The visual modality of a sign language, on the other hand, permits an alternative system of formally marking distinctions among referents; instead of labelling indices with features corresponding to qualities inherent in the referents to which they are anchored,  3  they can be associated with physical locations, arbitrarily assigned or actual. It happens to be a property of such a system that, like color-coding, it allows distinctions along a continuum; there is therefore potentially an infinitude of overt distinctions corresponding to the theoretical infinitude of indices. Also like colour-coding of course, the upper bound on the number of distinctions that can in practice be made is determined by the limits on the precision with which humans can distinguish between adjacent points on a continuum. \n The important point here is that there is in principle no conflict between the facts of ASL and the understanding of reference assumed in GB or HPSG. Each of these theories does in fact posit unique indices for each referent in a given discourse; the formal features of spoken language merely fail to reflect this. It is a consequence of the modality of ASL (and other sign languages) that they have the means to reflect overtly the one-to-one nature of index-referent mapping. \n We saw in the previous chapter how HPSG deals with indices in relation to nominals: they are treated as being inherent to particular lexical nominals. Thus,  book  is specified in the lexicon as introducing an index with the agreement features 3rd, singular, neuter. There are only as many pronouns in the HPSG lexicon as there are morphological distinctions between pronominal forms according to agreement features;  'doubling-up'  of pronominal function in a single form is easily captured thanks to the partial nature of information supplied by lexical feature structures. Thus, English  you  is unspecified for number and gender; the former may be supplied by the morphology of a verb subcategorizing it as a subject, the latter by virtue of coindexation, hence unification, with a nominal introducing a gender-specific index. However, if we adopt this account of pronouns for ASL, then we will indeed have to posit an infinitude of lexical pronouns, each introducing a distinct index, each one specified for a different morphology - i.e., a different locus. Standard HPSG thus does not appear to provide a satisfactory account of the pronominal system of ASL. \n   3.1.2  Directional verbs and the HPSG account of verb agreement  \n A further difficulty is presented by the phenomenon of directional verbs. ASL verbs can be broadly divided into two classes:  non-directional  and  directional.   Directional verbs in turn come in two varieties,  uni-directional  and  bi-directional.  Directional verbs, as the designation suggests, typically involve a specific movement from one locus towards another. In the case of uni-directional verbs, this movement often originates at a particular (invariant) point on the signer 's body and moves towards the locus assigned to the entity filling the patient role  4  in the semantic relation described by the verb. Thus, TELL, for instance, begins with a handshape at the signer 's chin and moves towards the appropriate object locus. Both the origin and the target of movement of bi-directional verbs are dictated by the roles they assign: the agent 's locus is the starting point and, again, the patient 's locus is the movement 's end-point; GIVE is such a verb. Plain verbs are those whose form is not affected by role-allocation, such as UNDERSTAND. There is a consensus among researchers into ASL as to how these verbal phenomena are best treated: one aspect of the form of a directional verb in ASL - its movement - is dependent on its arguments; since there is a clear analogy between such a dependency and the verb agreement phenomena which are pervasive in spoken languages, it is considered appropriate to analyze them in the same terms. Thus, directional verbs are often referred to as  inflecting  and non-directional verbs as  plain  verbs. \n In GB theory, verb agreement is a phenomenon arising out of movement to the verbal node of an autonomous, structurally represented segment (INFL, or AGR) comprising  'a bundle of features'  (to use the standard locution) - or, possibly, movement of the verb to the node containing the agreement features. In either case, agreement is construed as a morphological mechanism that is located in the grammar, and agreement features exist independently of particular verbs. In HPSG, by contrast, the standard assumption is that verb agreement is best dealt with in the lexicon. Agreement features are not encoded directly on verbs, however; rather, it is assumed that agreement is a direct consequence of argument selection. Since the elements of a head 's valence lists are  synsem  objects, it follows that verbs are capable of selecting the INDEX feature of their NP arguments. An English third-singular verb is thus one that selects a subject NP whose INDEX has the features [PERS  3rd ] and [NUM  sing ]. The inflectional paradigm is captured by lexical rules specifying that particular phonological functions on the base form are constrained to accompany particular argument selections; hence, in English there is a  3rd-singular  lexical rule that derives, from a verbal base form, a verb that has 3rd-singular morphology and the index of whose subject has 3-rd singular agreement features.  \n We have observed that, if we adhere to standard HPSG assumptions, we must posit the existence in the ASL lexicon of an infinitude of pronominal forms. Given the HPSG understanding of the nature of verb agreement, there is an even more acute problem in the case of verbs. Just as there is theoretically an infinity of pronominal forms, so we must assume that the inflectional paradigm for each directional verb is open-ended; and, given the foregoing assumptions, we must also assume that each form is lexically represented. Clearly, while the number of inflectional forms available for uni-directional verbs is equal to the number of available indices, the number of forms of bi-directional verbs approaches the square of this figure. Lexical rules cannot simplify matters here; since each distinct inflectional form requires a distinct lexical rule to derive it, the number of lexical rules needed will be equal to the number of verbal forms.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "9f5ed66e-41df-48b1-9a62-b5abae39f60b", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.522593+00:00"}
{"text": "<Funeral business>\n\n\n<$A>\n  CHAPTER 1 THE BACKGROUND  \n  1.1 INTRODUCTION  \n A brief study into the background of the funeral directing industry is necessary, in order to show how    today 's   business has evolved. In a relatively short period of time (two hundred years at the most), the act of burying the dead, in this part of the world, has, from being a private, family run affair, become a recognized business form, competing for a market like any other commercial interest. \n There have always been 'undertakers' of sorts operating in the confines of urban space. It can be a dirty, smelly and altogether distressing task in dealing with the deceased, and as a consequence people have happily paid others to carry out various tasks on their behalf. However, the various tasks tended to be associated with different persons - the gravediggers, coffin makers, embalmers, doctors, churches etc. The service supplied today    accommodates   all these different aspects, relieving the burden of organisation from private households. \n Before the modern funeral business as we know it today, there were three distinct recognizable stages of    its   development. Over time, it became manner of form that various vital functions changed hands. Gradually a new profession evolved, incorporating a greater number of services as time went on. The following pages examine this development in greater detail. \n  1.2. (i) THE BEGINNINGS - PRE 1800  \n Coffins as we know them first made their appearance towards the end of the seventeenth century. Before that time the dead were buried in shrouds or within hollowed out tree trunks. Lead lined caskets did exist but these were a    privilege   of the wealthier classes and clergy. \n In the majority of cases, funerals were the sole responsibility of the immediate family. In Dublin, the name  undertaker  was in use in the early eighteenth century and like other trades, those engaged in it, operated in shops designated by a sign or symbol. The exact service supplied by these undertakers is not so clear but they most likely provided some form of coffin. \"Mortician\" is a word which slowly crept into usage in place of \"Undertaker\", a description which ousted \"Coffin-maker\". (1) \n In newspapers as far back as 1736 and 1770, these undertakers advertised their    wares, such as Thomas Raper, a carpenter in Thomas Court,  \"opposite St.    Catherine 's   \"  selling  \"Plain Oak Coffins, neatly furnished\"  for sixteen shillings, whilst his highest price, for a  \"Fully mounted Coffin, silvered, lined, and covered\"  was <*> pound sign </*> 3.19s.7d.  \"Likewise\"  the advertisement ran  \"deal coffins, of all sizes, ready made\".  (2) \n Thirty years before the appearance of that advertisement, the parish carpenter of St. Catherines made coffins as is mentioned in the following news item taken from  Faulkner 's Dublin Journal:   \"Last week, the wife of one Kiskeen, in St. Catherine 's Parish, who had been sick above a fortnight, expired in all appearances, was washed, and stretched, and lay lifeless above for four hours, but when the poor parish carpenter came to take make of her for a coffin, the poor woman groaned and breathed and immediately came to herself, since which time she is perfectly recovered. \n \"This is the second time she hath disappointed her loving husband in the same manner.\"  \n The same paper had another story to report some six weeks later, this read:  \"This week dyed (in earnest) the wife of one Kiskeen, who was twice ready to be buried formerly, but to her loving husband 's disappointment came to life. Fearing the like accident might happen again, he immediately put her into a coffin, had it nailed up buryed her the next day\".  (3) \n The final years of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century, saw the coffin makers setting up coffin yards in Cook Street. Cook Street in the past had had other functions, being located in the oldest part of the city. Three of the nearby streets have names which speak for themselves - Cook Street (more correctly  Vicus Cocorum,  \"the street of cooks\"), Winetavern Street and Fishamble Street. (4) Cook Street was to become for a time the main centre of the coffin trade, and its function was as supplier of coffins. Normally their produce was shown on sale outside the premises for the bereaved to inspect, choose and buy a coffin, with which to carry out the burial. The brilliantly lit coffin sheds with their clean smell of sawdust and new wood, open to the public, since people did not steal coffins which were unpawnable, contrasted    favourably   with the dingy surroundings. (5) \n It was from Cook Street that some of the oldest present-day undertakers, found their origins but it was not until later on in the nineteenth century that this new service became apparent. Another advertisement tells us that Charles Mitchell had    succeeded   to the business of D. Staunton, deceased, and he respectfully informed his friends and the public that  \"he continues the coffin and shroud warehouse, at Number 14, Cook Street, Orders Daily Attended to\".  (6) \n According to one of the funeral directors spoken to during the field work stage, the Cook Street and Winetavern Street operations tended to cater for the working class slum/tenement areas of Dublin, the housing around Cook Street being particularly bad. Almost a quarter of the buildings in the vicinity were in ruins or were vacant, and some sites were just waste ground. \n    Dublin 's   gentry at the time ignored the Cook Street produce, preferring instead to use coffins from Millar and Beatty 's, furniture makers, who had an outlet in Grafton Street up to the middle of the nineteenth century. \n The demise of the Cook Street emporiums coincided with the emergence of the undertaking  trade  itself, as it started incorporating a more complete service on offer. Out of a total of nineteen coffin-makers in Dublin in 1836, sixteen were in Cook Street. In 1880, there were only five there out of a total of twenty five in the city as a whole. (7) By this stage many of the coffin-making families were now employed by morticians in other parts of the city. \n  1.2. (ii) 1814-1900 THE EMERGENCE STAGE.  \n The oldest funeral directing business in existence today is Nichols ' of Lombard Street, formerly of Lincoln Place. Its initial function was quite limited, supplying horse drawn vehicles, for\na) Hearses for funeral processions from church to graveyard, and\nb) Supplying hacks to the gentry for the hunting season.\nTherefore in the early part of the nineteenth century the family (or whoever was organising the burial), purchased the coffin either from Cook Street or Grafton Street and arranged all other aspects of the funeral such as church services, grave openings and alike themselves. The earliest firms, still in existence today, merely supplied a means of transport from the church to the various graveyards around Dublin at that time. These included Mount Jerome, Glasnevin, Deans Grange or in local churches which had adjacent graveyards. \n Gradually, the role of the mortician changed later into the nineteenth century. Up to 1890, there were six main funeral directors in the city. (Fanagans, Nichols, Farrells, Corrigans, Keogh Hendricks and Wallers). These firms employed most of the coffin-making families who had previously been in Cook Street, such as the Kenny 's, Byrnes and Kellers. The firms which had formerly provided a transport service had been otherwise known as  Job Carriage Proprietors  supplying hearses and men only. By 1890, with the coffin-makers now working from private yards, they became known as  Complete Funeral Undertakers  supplying transport, coffins and immediate requisites such as burial clothing. \n The choice of location of these new firms was very much limited by the size of property which could be obtained. In order to carry out a very basic service, an undertaker required a yard which could cater for a minimum of half a dozen horses. This may account for some firms changing their location. Nichols moved in 1890 from Lincoln Place nearby Lombard Street because of an increasing demand on space. More horses needed a greater sized area to live in, hence firms had to move to where they could acquire sufficient land. There is no evidence to suggest that firms at this time changed location to benefit from a change in the socio-economic status of their clients. In fact, firms usually changed location to within a short distance of the old premises. \n It was also at this time that the general public began to recognise the funeral business as a separate profession. Families adopted    allegiances   to particular firms, much in the same way as families do with doctors or solicitors. This may have been due to the suitable location of a certain firm, or, the type of clientele which regularly used the firm. Religion and class status would certainly have been a factor. \n What is undisputed is that the    funeral   businesses at this time were extremely busy. Death rates were, in places, exceptionally high and    led   to enormous pressure on the graveyards of Dublin. The two main cemeteries, Glasnevin and Mount Jerome, both report huge numbers of interments at this time. Glasnevin had interments of all religions - the first important burial there had been of a Protestant, Edward Ruthven, a colleague of O'Connell - the majority of Protestants chose the exclusive Mount Jerome. The proportion of burials reflected the sectarian divide. By 1900, there were something like 1,000 burials a year at Mount Jerome. Around 4,000 paid-burials took place annually at Glasnevin, while between 2,500 and 3,000 paupers were interred in  'Poor Ground'.  (8) \n There were only six firms to carry out the large number of funerals in the city at this time. This must have lead to a shortage of resources at crucial times. George Bernard Shaw described how slow moving funeral carriages, once out of sight of houses and shops, galloped to the cemetery gates before slowing down once more, became an amusing feature of Dublin life at this time. \n  1.2. (iii) THE TWENTIETH CENTURY  \n The great advantage that the funeral business had over other firms which primarily offered a local service was that it was transport based. It could go beyond the limits of other business types to carry out a 'contract' without having to incur the expense of opening up premises elsewhere. Also the vast majority of Dublin 's population lived between the two canals, not requiring further expansion. If a burial had to take place outside of the usual operating area, it was within the scope of the firm to be able to carry out. \n Gradually, the number of funeral firms began to increase. This was at a time when the absolute numbers living in Dublin was also increasing. This is examined in detail in the next chapter. \n The third phase of the    trade 's   development was as a result of the widespread introduction of the telephone. It had a number of effects on the firm - customer relationship. For the first time funerals could be arranged over the telephone and this    led   to the firms offering a more complete service to that of before. This included the insertion of death notices into the morning and evening newspapers, the supplying of floral tributes and the responsibility of opening a grave in the desired cemetery. \n Inevitably, throughout this century, the motor vehicle has replaced the horse as being the main form of transport. Medical procedures regarding the treatment of remains has become far more advanced and far more widespread. Almost without exception, coffins are no longer made on the premises of funeral directing firms. This task is now carried out by separate firms who can concentrate wholly on this aspect, and drive the per unit cost of manufacture lower. Funeral firms now purchase ready made coffins from these firms and assemble, apply a finish and line the interior of the coffins themselves. \n It would be foolish however, to suggest that it was the telephone and technical advances which were the main factors in the spatial development of the funeral business this century. Throughout this time, Dublin has been changing in terms of its size, shape and form. It is this, above all else, which has dictated the spatial changes in location of the funeral business as we know it today.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "85c6e12e-ecee-469b-8dc4-231bcb1b40a9", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.523515+00:00"}
{"text": "<ELT texts>\n\n\n<$A>\n Sue Mullins 06/02/02 \n Task One: \n a) The newspaper article in Extract A is simply used to present the topic of the lesson. (Time capsules and what we will be viewed as in the future). The 2 articles do not contain any examples of the grammar focus yet lead on nicely to the freer-speaking activity. Thus, the purpose of these articles is not to present any language in context, but to generate interest in the topic and to give the students examples of what has already been stored in capsules so that they can perform the freer-speaking activity with more    background   information and hopefully produce more output. \n b) The letter is used to present the information needed for the dialogue in a more formal, written style. The students must then transform the information into a more informal, spoken style. The purpose of the letter in relation to ex. 1 is to get the students to think about appropriate language in varying contexts. \n Task II \n The focus of the grammar exercises in 4 is the first conditional, use and usage. It begins with only 2 example sentences in the box which, although related to the text, do not occur in context in the text. This gives it the appearance of a quite mechanical, deductive approach. However, the questions in 4.1 allow the students to work out the form and meaning in an inductive manner. These type of questions will promote    students '   understanding of the target language if they have worked it out themselves. \n Ex. 4.1 concentrates on form as the students have to re-arrange the jumbled sentences. By focusing on the syntax of the first conditional, students should hopefully be able to produce the target language more effectively. \n In Ex. 3, the focus is on differentiating the meaning of 'if' and 'when'. This gap-fill provides 'mini' contexts to get the students to focus not only on use (sentence syntax) but also on usage (in what contexts do we exchange 'if' for 'when') \n Ex. 4 is a simple drill in which the pronunciation is already given. This could have been approached in a more inductive manner by asking the students to tell you what they hear and what sounds are elided. \n Ex. 5 enables the students to practice the target structure in a controlled way before attempting the freer-speaking activity. The students have already worked on the form and meaning, and have heard models of the target languages. This is now their first chance to produce it and for the teacher to assess their strengths and weaknesses. \n These exercises encompass a bottom-up approach and are quite inductive despite their appearance and lack of context. \n TASK III \n The pre-intermediate class I have in mind consists of 8 learners of mixed European nationalities and ages 17-40 <*> plus sign </*>. They meet for only 4 hours per week yet are very keen, conscientious learners as they are mostly living and working (mostly au pairs) here in Belfast for up to one year. \n I think the reading and all the exercises that go with it are very usable; the questions begin with reading for gist and then reading for more specific detail, cumulating in a word hunt (matching definitions). I would, however, introduce the topic through some pre-reading questions such as,  \"What has changed the most, in your opinion, between life now and life 100 years ago.\"  I would also get students to look at the headings and pictures to try to get them to predict the context of the articles and to focus on the style of newspaper headings. \n Grammar exercise 4, although good in its own right, does not flow from the reading as there are no examples of this in the text. The first conditional is also not apparent in the guiding questions of the speaking activity and so I would leave this out altogether and use it with another text that actually contains examples of the target language. \n I would adapt the speaking activity slightly in that initially students work in pairs answering the questions in 5.1 but with a limited number of items (eg. 6) which the students must come to an agreement on. Firstly, however I would try to pair the students, so that the more mature ones (40 <*> plus sign </*>) are working together as I think it could generate an interesting discussion on the values people of a different generation give to certain items. \n\n\n<$A>\n  Pilot written exam - Sue Mullins  \n   Task 2   \n All three texts apparently come from the same source yet vary in difficulty. The reason for this is mainly lexical and topical as the grammatical structures of imperatives for giving strong advice and the first conditional is dominant throughout texts A, B and C. \n Both texts A and B are of a more general nature in that they contain a lot of information that may seem to be common sense to the students. Consequentially, the students can rely heavily on their background knowledge along with the pictures for guessing any unknown words, for example, 'garden shed, tools' etc. in Extract A. However, as the majority of my students would not be car owners they may find the vocabulary in Extract C not only lexically dense (e.g ignition, log book, immobiliser, quarter lights, etc.) but also not very useful for everyday life. \n Text A contains a series of very short texts (1-2 sentences per picture) and this combined with the visual aid would make it the easiest in terms of lexical density and readability. I would use this with Intermediate level or above. Extract B goes into more detail and so the students would come across a higher percentage of unknown words, for example, phrases such as 'chat about, overhear, pay in advance, sling holdall, saddlebag,' etc. and the pictures would not necessarily provide the clues to help them guess successfully. I would use this with Upper-Intermediate - Advanced. Text C contains so many 'unuseful' vocabulary items due to its specific nature that I would be reluctant to use it at all. However, I would also class this as Upper-Intermediate - Advanced. \n   Task 3   \n I would use Extract A for an integrated skills lesson with an intermediate general English class that I have been teaching for three months now. The class consists of 6 students of mixed nationalities - 2 Japanese, 1 HK, 1 Taiwanese, 1 Spanish and 1 Columbian. They are all very hard-working and often stay after class to consolidate what they have learnt that day. They integrate well together as a class and in smaller units and the stronger members of the group (Spanish and HK) are very willing to help the others. \n  Lead-In 1 -    I would initially get students interested in the topic by asking them to compare measures of household security that are typical in their country and ask them to recount any stories they may have of break-ins, etc. This stage will activate their schemata and hopefully produce some   of   the vocabulary needed for the text. \n  Lead-In 2 -    I would then ask them to examine the title 'How householders help house-breakers' and predict the content. \n  Listening -    Next the students would be given a set of jumbled pictures and listen to a recording of the text in order to number the pictures as they hear them to improve their listening for gist and so that they do not concentrate on every word of the text as they are prone to do. \n  Reading for detail and Vocabulary -    Then I would provide them with the pictures and text and ask the students to read in detail whilst underlining any words they do not know. They would then have to guess the meaning  before  checking their dictionary. We could then discuss their strategies of what they guessed correctly and how. \n  Grammar -    Next I would ask the students to list the constructions involved in giving strong advice, e.g. 'Never leave, make sure, see they 're fitted, don't leave, it 's best to ...' etc. I would then set some controlled grammar practice activities possibly involving a similar gapped text where students must fill in an appropriate verb phrase and adverb of frequency. \n  Writing -    I would then set a similar writing task, e.g. 'Dangers of Travelling' and ask the students to gather ideas in group about advice for travellers. They should then start writing their advice in pairs and edit each    other 's   work. \n  Homework -    The students must make a poster including pictures to accompany the text to be put on the TEFL Centre wall. \n\n\n<$A>\n Name: Sue Mullins \n Date: 12/01/02 \n   Question 2 Task 3   \n   Class Profile   \n The class consists of 6 'high' elementary learners. They are: 2 S. Korean women 1 Chinese women 1 Japanese woman 1 young male from Hong Kong 1 young female from Columbia This particular group of learners work very well together; they are hard-working and make excellent progress because of their use of strategies such as 'inferring meaning'. Only the Hong Kong boy relies heavily on his dictionary as his level is slightly below the others but they are happy to share their knowledge with him. Fairly high-level vocabulary and grammatical constructions are to be found in the text such as, 'precautions, general practitioner, vaccination, cope with' and the use of the gerund on Line 36, etc. I have chosen this group because the text would be quite difficult for other elementary learners who were not prepared to infer meaning. \n   Exploiting the Text   \n I would introduce the topic of the text by getting students into two groups to talk about holidays they have had, any illnesses on holiday, and what medicine they would typically bring with them, etc. Then, as the text contains quite a number of high-level vocabulary for elementary, I would divide the students into groups A,B, and C with each group reading a different column of text ('Take Good Care', 'Safety First' and 'Bon Voyage'). I would then check each groups ' understanding of the text and deal with vocabulary by encouraging them to infer meaning. Next, the students should team up with members from the other groups and orally share the advice they have read. As a form of feedback, I would ask them to report back on the advice they would/would not follow. \n I would then devise exercises to focus on the unique style of the leaflet as it is quite distinct. For example, the language is 'to the point' and direct, bullet points are employed and various ways of giving advice can be noted such as imperatives, infinitives of purpose, etc. Here are a few examples that I would focus on: <#>(L1) To enjoy the sun ... you need a little sun know how. (L6) To take care of your skin, there 's no need to stay out of the sun for good. (L15) Don't use vegetable oil (L17) Take extra care of children (L18) Remember, you can burn... (L54) Make sure you ... \n I would also draw students ' attention to the ordering and importance of the information because this also adds to the style and the L2 learners should be made aware of variation in style even from the early stages. \n As a follow-up, I would ask students to prepare their own leaflet and personalise it by giving it a heading such as 'Advice for Foreigners Preparing to Study in Belfast for the First Time'. \n\n\n<$A>\n  Sue Mullins  - 10/04/02 \n  Task 1  \n a) The purpose of the text is to present the grammar focus '   definite   and    indefinite   articles' in context. The text has been constructed specifically for this purpose as the examples are clearly laid out. It combines elements of both deductive and inductive in that the rules are clearly given, yet the student must choose which rule is being applied. The text is helping them to notice when and where to use articles and encourages cognitive thinking as they have to work things out for themselves. \n b) The usefulness of the Grammar Reference section is limited because of the specific terminology and the information over-load. It is useful, however, in relation to this short text as the no. of examples of articles are limited and the students are not required to read every rule but rather to scan the Grammar Section for the appropriate answer. Any activity requiring more detailed analysis of the Grammar Section would be a chore for the students and a case of too much information all at once. It would hinder their ability to apply the rules if they were not first limited and shown in context.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d63ad664-3a3d-4d8a-9206-4a7d8149c62b", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.524548+00:00"}

DECIDING THE TOPIC \n In order to get some ideas of what topic I could use for my project, I went    through   my course text books and class notes from the areas we had covered in class. These gave rise to several ideas eg. The Four Maxims of Speech, or the use of and difference between \"between\" and \"through\". However, the subject of tag questions has always interested me and so I have used this opportunity to study the topic further. \n 2. EXPANDING THE IDEA \n I took my ideas to my tutor, Dr J Kirk, who made various suggestions which we discussed together. One of these was that I could consider the topic of questions as a whole, that is including all types of questions (yes/no questions, wh- questions, declarative questions, and tag questions.) However I decided that in the time space available, it would not be either practical or possible to do an adequately detailed analysis of the subject. \n 3. THE DATA \n The next thing to consider was data - what type of data I wanted, how I could get it, how much I should collect. I decided to use Northern Irish media as a source for my unrecorded data and Dr Kirk suggested the Northern Ireland Corpus of Transcribed Speech for my already recorded data. He volunteered to make a concordance for me from his computer files of possible tag questions, and provided me with this in both computer print out and cassette tapes. \n 4. RECORDING AND USING THE DATA \n I researched into the names of the Northern Irish TV and radio presenters and the times of their shows and proceeded to tape the following programs: Gerry Anderson 10.12.92, 14.12.92 George Jones 9.12.92, 10.12.92, 14.12.92, 15.12.92, 23.12.92 John Kelly 10.12.92, 15.18.92, 18.12.92 Rose Neill 10.12.92, 15.12.92 Sean Rafferty 10.12.92, 15.12.92 It was at this point that I decided not to record any more TV programs, because I had no TV in my flat in Belfast and could only record on weekends when I went home. \n After listening to the recordings I decided to concentrate    on only   one presenter rather than on all five. I chose George Jones because: 1. he had a wide ranges of guests on his program, ranging from eight year old school children to AA traffic reporters. So a whole range of sex, age and social background was covered. 2. His was the only program to have a majority of interviews with N. Ireland people. The others eg. Sean Rafferty had English or Southern Irish celebrities. 3. He also had more tag questions on his program compared to the others. \n I then transcribed the five George Jones tapes - tapes 1 and 2 I transcribed fully to give an idea of the frequency of    occurrences   of tag questions in conversation. Tapes 3, 4 and 5, I only gave a short paragraph to identify context. \n I then listed 50 tag questions found in these tapes. (The amount had been predecided on the advice of Dr Kirk.) \n I then went through the NITC (Northern Ireland Transcribed Corpus of Speech) concordance and listed the 16 tag questions found in it. \n 5. RECORDING INTONATION \n I went through my own five tapes of George Jones programs and a further fifteen tapes from the NITC and recorded the intonation patterns of the tag questions, that whether they rose (marked and  <-> refered <->  referred   to as /) or whether they fell (marked and  <-> refered <->  referred   to as \\). \n 6. RESEARCH INTO ARTICLES WRITTEN ON THE SUBJECT \n I read the following articles on tag questions: (1) John Algeo,  It 's a myth innit? Politeness and the English Tag Question . (2) S. Greenbaum, R. Quirk, A Student 's Grammar of the English Language, pp.234-235,  Tag Questions . 11.6. (Longman, 1990).

Hudson,  The Meaning of Questions  pp 1-29 \n The following are brief summaries of (1) - (4). \n  (1) JOHN ALGEO \n Algeo 's rather humorous article was to undermine the belief that tag questions used by the British people as a whole were not a polite device, but rather the opposite. He highlights the following five uses of tag questions: 1. Informal Tags; used mainly to ask for information. The speaker values the person to whom he is talking more than at any other time. Speaker asks for information without presuming to know what the hearer will say. It will have a rising intonation. \n 2. Confirmatory Tags; to draw the person addressed into the conversation, the speaker assumes the hearer will agree with the truth of the statement. Is an invitation to express agreement, usually with a falling tone. \n 3. Punctuational Tags; to emphasize the point which the speaker has just made, and asks the hearer to pay attention to the speaker rather than actually participate. \n 4. Peremptory Tags; usually used in response to a statement the speaker does not want to hear or a question he does not want to answer. It usually follows a statement of obvious truth, and tends to be condescending and impatient. The effect of it is to leave the hearer speechless. It is a signal the speaker wants to avoid the subject and considers the conversation at an end. \n 5. Aggressive Tags; follows a statement that is by no means obvious and that the addressee cannot be reasonably expected to know. It is insulting and provocative. Eg. (his example) A I rang this morning but you didn't answer. B Well, I was having a bath, wasn't I? \n 4. and 5. are part of a response to a question, or an implied question, or a suggestion for action. They are both antagonistic (of two extremes) and oppose cooperative communication. \n (2) R. QUIRK \n The most common type of tag question is one with reversed polarity, in the form of a yes/no question. It consists of an operator and a subject pronoun, a choice of operator and a pronoun, and can have either a rising or falling intonation. Thus there are four main types of tag question sentences; (a) negative statement, positive tag, falling tone (b) negative statement, positive tag, rising tone (c) positive statement, negative tag, falling tone (d) positive statement, negative tag, rising tone \n The meaning of the tag question involved a statement and a question, that is, it asserts something and then invites a response. \n There are two factors involved - ASSUMPTION and EXPECTATION. The first expressed by the statement, the latter by a question.    It   is therefore possible to distinguish four types 1) Positive assumption, neutral expectation <*> plus sign </*> <*> minus sign </*> 2) Negative assumption, neutral expectation <*> minus sign </*> <*> plus sign </*> 3) Positive assumption, positive expectation <*> plus sign </*> <*> minus sign </*> 4) Negative assumption, negative expectation <*> minus sign </*> <*> plus sign </*> \n A tag with a rising tone invites verification, while one with a falling tone invites confirmation of the statement. The latter tends to be an exclamation rather than a genuine question, and sometimes the truth is self-evident and no answer is needed. \n The least common type has a positive statement and question, usually with a rising tone and is used sometimes with a tone of sarcastic suspicion. The statement itself is usually    preceded   by  \"oh\"  or  \"so\" , indicating the speaker 's arrival at the conclusion by inference or by recalling what has already been said. \n 3) SIV NASSLIN \n In chapter 2, Nasslin uses two analyses by Cattell and Ogawa to discuss Semantic Underlying Structure and Analyses. \n Cattell discusses how APTS (tag sentences) differ because of the different points of view of the speaker. If, he says the tone is falling, the speaker has a confident viewpoint and is inviting agreement; if on the other hand the tone is rising, we see a more tentative advancement of the speaker 's view. He also deals with    the   truth value of the proposition, expressed by the speaker in the RC (reference clause). \n In chapter 3 he deals with SC (sincerity conditions), and modifies and develops    Richard   Hudson 's article. He lists 4 SC's 1) The speaker believes the propositions is true. 2) The speaker believes that the hearer knows at least as well as he    himself does that/whether the proposition is true or false. 3) The speaker does not express any personal opinion as to the truth of the proposition, he merely reports what other people say. The speaker has only reasons to believe that the hearer/other people or the hearer and other people believe the proposition is true. 4) The speaker wants the proposition, which is that the interlocutor is going to do something, to be true. In the fourth chapter he gives a summary of the discussion of SC's, which is as follows; 1) The rp (reversed polarity) and cp (constant polarity) APTS's have different SC's in their RC's: rp APTS's normally have SC 1) CP APTS's normally have SC 3) \n 2) In a strict interpretation of syntax in the rp De-APST (a declarative with tag) and rp Ex-APTS opposing SC's are arrived at leading to conduciveness, but only as one possible interpretation among others. \n 3) There is ambiguity as to whose opinion is expressed (ie. The    interlocutor 's   or other people 's) in the RC of the cp APTS as long as    pragmatic   factors are not considered. (The basic or at least most frequent meaning is that the    interlocutor 's   opinion that the proposition is true is expressed. It is also possible that the proposition is both the opinion of the others and the    interlocutor   .) \n 4) The exhortations, especially the Im-APTS (imperative with tag) differ from cp APTS's with other functions in not having SC's. (It is proposed in present study that the exhortations have an implied RC to which the tag belongs.) The Im-APTS is in reality an Im-De-APTS, whether tag is positive or negative. \n 5) In interrogatives (whether in APTS or independent sentences used as an exclamation.) function of  n't  means to tell us the speaker believes the interlocutor thinks the    proposition   is true. Prosody tells us that the interrogative is an exclamation. \n 6)An interrogative used as an exhortation gets a tag due to the new SC (SC1. instead of SC2.). This results in a negative cp APTS functioning as a rp APTS. \n 7) Difference between what the negative interrogative (untagged) and the rp APTS express is not due to their having different SC's. It is a result of how the SC's are in balanced relation to each other, ie. which of the SC's is focused on.\n 8) A speaker can pretend that he believes a proposition to be true (SC1), or he can pretend that he is neutral to a proposition (SC 3), and he can pretend that he believes the interlocutor knows at least as well as he himself does whether the proposition is    true   or not (SC 2). The difference in what the speaker pretends leads to different types of    irony   being used. \n He discusses speaker attitudes and included are the two functions -\nconduciveness and softening, which are the two basic attitudes of the speaker and whose varieties include impatience, rudeness and assertiveness. \n 4) JOHN KIRK \n The purpose of Dr. Kirk 's article which he based on the Miller and Brown Corpus (MB), was to  \"substantiate their claim that, in discourse, tag questions have indeed an interactional value\" . He takes the 8 pragmatic categories which MB proposed and among other things shows the wide range of illocutionary functions of tag questions.(p. 228) The eight categories are as follows; \n CATEGORY A \n Proposition-factual Speaker proposition-speaker is uncertain of truth of    proposition   Hearer proposition-hearer believes proposition might be true but is less sure Interrogative force-weakly conducive Speaker expectation-to let hearer verify/falsify truth of factual proposition for speaker Effect-hearer may or may not comply Polarity-reversed Intonation-falling \n CATEGORY B \n Proposition-factual Speaker proposition-speaker uncertain of truth of proposition Hearer proposition-hearer believes proposition might be true but is less sure Interrogative force-weakly conducive Speaker expectation-to let the hearer verify or falsify truth of proposition Effect-hearer may or may not comply Polarity-reversed or constant Intonation-rising \n CATEGORY C \n Proposition-nonfactual Speaker proposition-speaker sure of truth of proposition Hearer proposition-hearer believes proposition to be true and/or is prepared to believe it probably is true Interrogative force-strongly conducive Speaker expectation-to inform hearer of his opinion and let hearer express corroboration Effect-hearer may or may    not   express agreement Intonation-falling Polarity-reversed \n\n AN EXPLANATION OF THE QNA ANALYSIS TABLE 1.1 \n Table 1.1 is an accumulation of the three articles which go together to make up Analysis 1, that is, Quirk, Nasslin, and Algeo. There are 6 headings in the table, and I will now go through each one explaining (1) which article it came from and (2)a brief summary of what it means. \n (a) NAME OF TAG \n I took these 5 types of tags from Algeo 's article pp.445-447. To Algeo, tag questions are  \"devices by which people relate to one another in the process of a conversation\"  and the 5 categories are the 5 main uses of the tag question in conversation. They go from one side of the politeness scale to the other, 1 being very polite, and 5 being extremely impolite. \n (b) INTONATION \n Intonation is dealt with in all 3 articles; Quirk p234, Nasslin p21 and Algeo pp445-446. However, there is only a specific intonation given by Algeo to 1 and 2. The other categories appear to be able to have either a rising or a falling tone. \n (c) MODALITY TYPE \n Nasslin deals with modality in Section 6.3 of his book. The term covers  \"both the view on the proposition and attitudes\" . Basically there are 3 types of modality; (1) cognitive - the speaker 's view on the truth of the proposition eg. certainty, uncertainty. (2) volitive - the speaker 's wish to influence the    interlocutor  . (3) emotive - this includes softening, reinforcement, surprise, expectation agreement, and others such as interruption or objection.(p60)", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "8a678a9e-81fe-4a4b-a245-87c5c6740682", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.525481+00:00"}
{"text": "<Language and culture>\n\n\n<$A>\n  Culture as a system of participation  \n The idea of culture as a system of participation is based on the assumption that any action in the world, including verbal communication, has an inherently social, collective and participatory quality. This is a particularly insightful concept of culture for looking at how language is used in the real world, more specifically in Northern Ireland, because to speak a language means to be able to participate in interactions with a world that is always larger than us as individual speakers. Words carry in them a multitude of possibilities for connecting us to other human beings, other situations, events, acts, beliefs or feelings. This is primarily because of the ability that language has to describe the world as well as its ability to connect us with its inhabitants, objects, places and periods in social history. Therefore, if the world is held together by communicative acts and connected through communicative channels, to speak means to chose a particular way of entering the world and a particular way of sustaining relationships with those we come into contact with. In brief, what this theory is suggesting, is that all of us participate in the world in one way or another, particularly through speech or verbal communication, but there is a great deal of variation in the ways that we participate. If we were to relate this theory to the current situation in Northern Ireland, we might say that it is generally assumed that everyone within the wider community wants peace, but everyone also has different ideas about how to achieve peace. All participate in sharing the same objective, but there is a large degree of variation towards that goal. We might also refer to the example of terminology used to describe the north east part of the island. For some, it is known as the north, for others it is termed as 'Ulster' and for other still it is simply 'Northern Ireland.' What we can draw from this then, is that whilst participation requires the explicit sharing of existing 'resources' such as beliefs, languages, environment and people, it does not assume an equally shared knowledge or control over these resources. We might all exist socially as part of a larger unit, but there are many different parties involved within that unit. In Northern Ireland, we might identify two separate communities within this part of the island - nationalist and unionist. Quite often it is through the language that we use and the way that we use it that we identify the different variations within one larger community. In this way, language and culture in Northern Ireland combine to form a basis of identity. \n  Language and Culture as a means of Identification  \n As already mentioned, it is generally accepted that there is a natural connection between the language spoken by members of a social group and that group 's identity. Features such as accent, vocabulary and discourse patterns allow speakers to identify themselves and in turn, to be identified as members of this or that discourse community. Members acquire a sense of strength, pride, social importance and historical continuity from speaking the same language as the group they belong to. Group identity is not a natural fact, but a cultural perception. What we perceive about a person 's culture and language is what we have been conditioned by our own culture to see. In periods of social fragmentation and multiple identities, each aspiring recognition, language adopts a symbolic value. When people feel economically or ideologically disempowered, or when their cultural or political identity is threatened, they attach particular importance to the maintenance or resurrection of 'their language'. They can also attribute cultural value to their language so that language acts as a way of participating in one culture as opposed to the culture of another. Language is used as a means of identifying members of one community (insiders) against members of another community; (those defined as outsiders). As Claire Kramsch rightly concludes then: A community 's language and its material achievements come to represent a social patrimony and a symbolic value that serve to perpetuate relationships of power and domination; they distinguish insiders from outsiders.  1  \n In this way, language acquires a symbolic value beyond its pragmatic use and becomes a totem of a cultural group. This is especially true of the recent situation in Northern Ireland. Language has become a metonymic symbol of ethnic identity. Sectarian ethnicity has adopted linguistic reinforcement with Catholic nationalists advocating Irish as a symbol of their cultural identity and Presbyterian unionists promoting an increasing awareness and circulation of Ulster Scots, but more specifically Ullans. \n Language and culture first emerged as a 'political axe to grind' in the 1980s from within the Maze prison. Republican inmates began learning Irish and studying the associated heritage and culture to reinforce their sense of identity. They embraced it as a weapon by talking and writing in Irish, or 'jailic,' as it was later dubbed, to perplex and annoy the wardens and police. The Irish language was selected as an indicator of difference between insiders, (in this case Nationalists) and outsiders, (Unionists). In this way, the Irish language also came to be perceived as a sign of political allegiance. Loyalists with some amount of initial amusement observed this new cultural front in the IRA 's campaign. However, as the renaissance of Irish and the advance of Sinn Fein 's political power extended beyond the perimeters of the Maze and tradition and identity were recognised as being capable of exerting a powerful political influence, some loyalists began embracing what had previously been a small, 'semi-eccentric cultural persuasion' as one writer of The Irish Times termed it. In this way, Ulster Scots gave cultural legitimacy to the unionist cause and language became a marker of cultural identity among the people of Northern Ireland. \n Having looked at the theory of how culture acts as a system of participation and having discussed something of the relationship between language, culture and identity with particular reference to Northern Ireland, I now need to substantiate my theoretical propositions with relevant data. Thus far, I have learned that we all exist socially as members of one larger community. Yet within this community there is a great deal of diversity and language is often used as a way of identifying such diversity or variations that exist in society as a whole. I have also discerned that in periods of social fragmentation or where there are multiple identities, language can adopt a symbolic value, both for insiders and outsiders. I have applied this theory to the current situation in Northern Ireland and have shown that language has become a metonymic symbol of ethnic identity, Irish as a symbol of nationalists identity and Ulster-Scots, or more specifically Ullans as a symbol of unionist identity. I now intend to substantiate this cultural theory by providing relevant data to support it. I intend to do this by assessing and analysing how far the expressed culture of Ulster-Scots compares with the vocabulary or lexis. I intend to investigate the opinion that the Ulster Scots language and heritage has only been set rolling out of a sense of cultural rivalry among some Protestants and unionists. Keen to counter-balance the onward march of the Irish language movement, coinciding with the unprecedented recognition and financial funding for the Irish language in the north (stimulated by Sinn Fein direct action such as erecting bilingual street signs) and motivated by a disillusionment with their previously cherished British heritage, it has been suggested that unionists have 'manufactured' a new written form of the Ulster-Scots dialect known as Ullans. I intend to suggest the possibility that the vocabulary used to compile Ullans, fails to compare with the expressed culture and is a prime example of how a community, whose cultural and political identity is threatened, refocuses their sense of identity around 'their' language, which in turn adopts a purely symbolic value. In this way, Ullans is used as a means of excluding outsiders (nationalists), and of maintaining a sense of unity and identity within the unionist community. Objectively, I want to assess the value of a statement made by Manfred Gorlach that Ulster Scots is:  'simply a second dialect relearnt to stress ethnicity.'   2  \n Speech versus Writing: an important distinction \n The terms Ulster Scots and Ullans when used inter-changeably, have created a lot of confusion. The cultural distinction between the traditional Scots dialect, which still has native speakers, especially in County Antrim and written Ullans, is usually blurred by activists. However, the difference should certainly be noted. The naturally expressive spoken dialect and its literary adaptations do indeed express and substantiate the culture of its speakers. The vocabulary of the dialect portrays this very clearly. In a poem entitled 'The Flow,' James Fenton uses words for peat cutting such as  'trinketin,'   'breeshin,'  and  'underfittin,'  that have no English equivalents. Moreover, James Orr 's poem entitled 'The Wanderer' also expresses the culture of Ulster-Scots tradition. The title of the poem suggests a simple story about someone lost in the mountains, but the poem has in fact a lot to tell us about the Ulster-Scots language. A Wanderer was a coded message for the readers in the times that Orr was writing. It had the specific meaning of a fugitive, especially a Covenanter being pursued by the military. It would seem then that the naturally spoken dialect of Ulster-Scots does express and substantiate the culture of its speakers. As Deputy Chief Executive of the Ulster-Scots Agency, George Holmes, told delegates at a recent conference in Ballymena,  'Our culture already exists and does not need to be manufactured.'   3  What Fenton says of the Scots Thesaurus is also true of the dialect vocabulary of Ulster as well. He says that Ulster-Scots tells us a lot about man 's attitude to the environment and to each other.  'It is like a map of man 's mind in which fragmentary pieces of the lore of the past jostle with perceptions of the present.'   4  This is certainly true, for the Ulster dialect is rich in references to folklife, especially farming, haymaking, carts and slipes, clothing, traditional medicine, animal husbandry and cooking to name but a few. Ulster-Scots has its own vocabulary for traditional foodstuffs including 'barnbrack,' ( a large round bun with dried fruit in it), 'farl,' (a quarter of a circular griddle scone), and 'fadge,' (a thick loaf of wheaten bread baked on a griddle or with a potato). Ulster has its unique religious vocabulary too, including phrases such as 'make your soul,' meaning 'to go confession.' The dialect is also rich in words for people. A 'moiley' for instance refers to a mild mannered person. A 'gabslake' refers to a person who acts the fool and talks too much. Furthermore, there are Ulsterisms - words found in Ulster, or words which were created elsewhere but now survive only in Ulster. Examples include the words 'champ,' and 'diamond,' (meaning town square). All of this reinforces the point that Ulster society and culture is distinct and the dialect has been shaped to express the people 's referential needs. It is evident that the language and heritage of Ulster-Scots has existed for years and is not something manufactured to rival the Irish sense of identity. Ulster Scots, it is said:  does express and articulate a rural community cohesion and has a role to play in opposing the decimation of rural communities. It is used by at least one very good amateur drama group. It enshrines the radical political thinking of James Orr and his contemporaries of 1798 and as such it is a historical and educational resource. It is a rich repository of Gaelic words which it has observed... It is the natural medium of beautiful songs. It is necessary for the understanding of many place names. It is a cross-community dialect and not the property of any one faction.   5  \n Clearly, the naturally occurring dialect of Scots where still spoken in Northern Ireland, is an integral part of the culture of the island. Moreover, far from being used as a symbol of cultural identity, Ulster-Scots appears to be a cross-community dialect. In an article featured in a recent edition of the News Letter, one reader recalls his experience of 'culture contact':  One day a few months ago when I was away in the Irish speaking parts of Donegal, the bean a'ti' or 'woman of the house' entered the living room with a large pot of freshly brewed tea for her visitors. Setting it on the table, she warned in Gaelic that it was still quite weak. When she saw that an American student staying there hadn't understood, it was Scots rather than English to which she turned - 'A'm juist efter wattin the tae.' Even today, many Gaelic speakers in both Scotland and Ulster have Scots as their second or    'auxiliary'   language... There is undoubtedly a long tradition of fruitful 'culture contact' between the two languages.  6   \n Interestingly, the reader ends his feature on a note of caution by saying  ' <-> lets  let 's   hope today 's activists maintain it.'", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "5b9fefb9-da9f-421e-8869-cdf77c6d7631", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.526497+00:00"}
{"text": "<Health and law>\n\n\n<$A>\n Tragic choices in resource allocation: can we learn from Oregon? \n CHAPTER ONE \n DECIDING WHO TO TREAT IN THE NHS \n  \"Assuming that a society has made some kind of decision as to how many kidney machines it will produce, how many soldiers it will need for a limited war, or how many births it can tolerate, how does it decide, explicitly or implicitly, who gets the kidney machines, who gets picked to serve in that limited war, who gets to have children?\"  Guido Calabresi (1) \n It is widely recognised, but accepted with difficulty, that health services today have finite resources to cover an infinite demand for treatment. Health care, despite provisions in the European Social Charter, the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and the Major Charter, is not the fundamental human right it is often thought to be, but instead must be rationed. The term, \"rationing\", used frequently to refer to the distribution of provisions at times of war, conjures up for many, images of scarcity, unfairness or discrimination. Indeed, it is these factors which give rise to most of the controversy relating to resource allocation, as people often feel that they have been unfairly treated - or not treated, as the case may be. \n Doctors taking the Hippocratic Oath must be all too aware of the impossibility of  \"giving their services for nothing\"  and of  \"serving one who is a stranger in financial straits.\"  (2) Physicians have a part to play in making decisions involving the allocation of resources, although ultimately, this   is   up to the politician. This is necessarily the case, as Dr. David Hadorn observes, because,  \"Physicians and other health care professionals are the only members of society with a broad enough perspective to estimate and compare the quality of life effects of different medical treatments.\"  (3) \n The cost of highly sophisticated, modern, medical technology is just one ironic reason why health authorities cannot afford to fund all necessary treatment: they spend money on this new equipment and consequently cannot afford to administer basic treatment to everyone. Another reason is that people are now living longer, and the elderly constitute the largest group of health care consumers. \n The problem, then, lies in the weighing-up of the arguments. Is the limited money better spent, for example, on hip replacement operations for one hundred seventy-year-olds, or on neuro-surgery for two thirty-year-olds? Should there be a cut-off age at which treatment for the elderly is stopped or refused? Interestingly, such discussions were taking place as far back as the Nineteenth Century, as Bernard Shaw recounts in his  Doctor 's Dilemma  , where two doctors discuss the fate of two men both requiring the same treatment to save their lives. \n Sir Patrick  \"Well, Mr. Saviour of lives: which is it to be? That honest decent man Blenkinsop, or that rotten blackguard of an artist, eh?\"  \n Ridgeon  \"It 's not an easy case to judge, is it? Blenkinsop 's an honest man; but is he any use? Dubedat 's a rotten blackguard; but he 's a genuine source of pretty and pleasant and good things.\"  <(4) \n Has the brilliant, but morally corrupt Dubedat got more right to the treatment\nthan the good, but unremarkable Blenkinsop? Decisions involve complex\nelements, such as the likelihood of the treatment 's success, whether there would be a\ngreat deal of pain, whether or not the family would be adversely affected, and whether\nor not the patient himself feels that the quality of life would be substantially\nimproved. Unfortunately, there are no easy answers to these questions, and no\ndefinitive method of measuring the very controversial area of priorities. \n It must be accepted, therefore, that all of the people will not be able to have\ntheir treatment funded all of the time. The question is rather, how can limited\nresources best be distributed to benefit most of the people most of the time? \n  Promises for those in the N.H.S.  \n Robert G. Evans, in his article,  \"'Rationing' Health Care: The Loaded\nAlternative\"  , described the NHS as seen through the eyes of hostile Americans\nas,  \"endless waits to see overworked and undertrained staff in obsolete and undermaintained facilities. Patients may be denied life saving treatment if they are old or for other reasons fail to receive high enough priority for scarce services whose availability is controlled by heartless, or at least unaccountable beaurocrats.\"  \n This criticism probably goes too far: facilities are hardly  \"obsolete\"  and nor can the decision-makers be described as  \"heartless,\"  but the system is certainly far from perfect. \n Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that,\n \"Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and his family, including food, clothing and medical care.\"  \n The Major charter established three basic rights emanating from the NHS Reforms, which were to come into effect in 1992:  \"a right to health care on the basis of clinical need....a right to receive emergency medical care at any time....and a right to be guaranteed admission for treatment by a specific date no later than two years from the day when your consultant places you on a waiting list.\"  \n This all appears very optimistic but seems to be based on an assumption that there is enough money to cater for treatment for everyone. However, there is only a limited amount of money to pay for treatment to which everyone is apparently entitled, and this was recognised in the NHS Reforms, which, it was stated,  \"could allow purchasers to allocate resources according to the patients ' capacity to benefit from care.\"  \n This provision demonstrates the logical conclusion that finite resources must\nbe rationed and allocated according to where they will do the most good. So,\nthere are rights to treatment, but these are in conflict with its cost. As touched on\npreviously, one of the reasons offered for this is the increasing attraction of new\nmedical technology. Sophisticated skills and tools are often procured at the cost\nof \"ordinary\" treatment, and what health services are capable of doing far exceeds\nwhat they can afford to do. Time and money expended on one thing necessarily\nexcludes the opportunity of spending them on something else, and clinicians now face\nthe difficult task of deciding between the utility of innovations that modern science\nhas created, which may save some gravely ill patients, and the advantage of providing\neveryone with at least basic treatment. \n THE QUALITY OF LIFE \n In the United Kingdom, unlike in Oregon, there is no legislation designed to\nassist the decision-maker in deciding who should be treated. In the past, age, gender and moral worthiness have been used as factors in decision-making, but in a modern, supposedly equal society, such criteria are anachronistic and unfair. The sole criterion derives from pure reason - that the money should be spent where it will be most beneficial; but what is meant by  \"most beneficial?\"  \n A simplistic response would be that treatment is most worthwhile where it will save a life, or in other words, postpone a death. However, this is not always the best solution. If, for example, the victim of a serious car accident was so brain damaged that he or she had to have constant observation, was in chronic pain, breathed by means of a ventilator, was tube-fed and had lost all human dignity, would that person not perhaps be better off dead? \n The recent case of two-year-old Thomas Creedon illustrates this point. He is both deaf and blind, is thought to be in constant pain and is fed through a hole in his stomach. Basically, his existence is being maintained by the marvel of medical technology, but does he have any sort of acceptable quality of life? His parents, battling to allow the treatment to be terminated obviously do not think so, and indeed, it can be argued that the money spent to keep his body functioning just enough to keep him alive would be much more effectively spent elsewhere, if it meant that another patient 's quality of life could improve. \n A similar issue arose in Laura Davies 's case. This child had undergone treatment throughout her five years for a serious bowel complaint. When it seemed that no cure could be found, her parents enquired about a transplant, but were discouraged by British doctors, since it was an experimental operation for children, and no-one had ever survived it for more than six months. Despite this advice, Laura had two massive multi-organ transplants in America, at a cost of <*> pound sign </*> 1 million, before her death some months later. \n There have been many criticisms of the parents of this tragic child, for forcing her to endure extra months, or perhaps years of gruelling treatment, knowing that there was virtually no chance of survival, instead of allowing her to die in relative comfort. \n The two cases described above show a tendency of the physicians to favour quantity of life over quality. However, it is more probable that the average person would rather have a high-quality short life than a long succession of years of suffering, with no light at the end of the tunnel. There has been a recent attempt to incorporate both of these factors in decision-making, which will be discussed in the following section. \n QUALITY-ADJUSTED LIFE YEARS \n QALYs, an acronym for \"Quality Adjusted Life Years,\" constitute a principal aid to decision-making in the National Health Service. The QALY incorporates the idea both of quality of life and quantity of life, and is derived from survival data and the value of different states of health. \n Before discussing the advantages and disadvantages of the QALY, it is necessary to show exactly what it is and how it is calculated. Alan Williams was at the source of the concept of QALYs. He stated that,  \"the essence of a QALY is that it takes a year of healthy life expectancy to be worth 1, but regards a year of unhealthy life expectancy to be worth less than 1. Its precise value is lower the worse the quality of life of the unhealthy person.....if being dead is worth zero, it is possible for a QALY to be negative, for the quality of someone 's life to be judged worse than being dead.\"  (5) \n The methodology used to quantify QALYs was designed by Rosser and Kind. (6) In their calculations, they incorporate distress and disability factors, establishing eight categories of disability and four distress ratings. Disability ranges from 1 (no disability) to 8 (totally dependent and unconscious), while the four stages of distress are: A, none; B, mild; C, moderate and D, severe. A group of seventy people were asked to combine all categories of distress and disability, to evaluate them, and the average scores were charted on a table as shown below. They had to give an evaluation, based on a scale ranging from -1 to +1, so that a quality of life score of +1 indicates absence of suffering. \n\n It is evident from this that QALY calculations necessarily involve a degree of arbitrariness. The degree of distress and disability is measured by means of a general consensus - other people decide how much pain or disability they reckon is caused by a certain condition, many of whom will not ever have suffered the symptoms themselves. This factor has given rise to much controversy concerning the justice and ethics of the QALY. \n At first glance, the concept of the QALY seems like the best solution to any resource allocation problem. Obviously treatment should be funded for the person who will obtain the best quality of life from it. If faced, for example, with a thirty-year-old and an eighty-year-old, who both need a heart by-pass operation, the likelihood of its success being excellent for the younger person, promising him a normal life expectancy with minimal disability, but offering the older patient only another year of pain and suffering, the logical and reasonable response would be to give it to the younger patient. \n In a perfect society, of course, all patients would be treated equally, and medicine would not take into account age, quality of life, or any other factor. However, when the issue concerns economic deficiency, meaning that choices  must  be made, such idealism is unrealistic and impracticable. \n Michael Lockwood states that the concept of the QALY is based on a welfarist element, saying that,  \"other things being equal, it should be regarded as preferable to confer greater aggregate benefit than less.\"  To him, it  \"doesn't seem unjust to choose to treat the patient for whom treatment is more likely to prove successful.\"  (7) This seems a fair statement, as long as extremes of situations are involved. It is not difficult to see reasons for treating a young healthy patient before an elderly, infirm patient, or of treating a baby who will have a normal life expectancy with treatment than one with only another hour to live despite treatment.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "55cff1d6-08ac-4c5a-8186-923331b9689a", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.527784+00:00"}
{"text": "<Language purism>\n\n\n<$A>\n  'language was made for man, not man for language'   1  \n There exists a prevalent misconception amongst the middle-aged that the world is going to the dogs. A priomordial fallacy: a misbelief maintained from ancient Nestor reflecting forlornly on the glorious heroics of the past to John Major remembering the illusory Britain of old where patriotism and harmony still presided; there seems to be a patent injustice in the obsession of comparing the present with what has gone before. \n This is because the worry, however, is not only confined to the state of the world but also to the supposed decline of the English language; the demise of which has been bemoaned in the past by literators such as Swift and Dr Johnson. Johnson claimed that English was  'resigned to the tyranny of time and fashion, and exposed to the corruptions of ignorance, and caprices of innovation'   2 ; a pedagogic avowal which has worryingly found contemporary resonance in the words of Michael Dummett, a Professor of Philosophy at Oxford University. In his latest polemic he hysterically remonstrates that the language is on the brink of anarchic degeneration and expounds a \"conspiracy theory\" of Kennedyesque proportions which lays the blame for this alleged malaise at the door of the whole educational establishment, accusing it of propagating a \"descriptivist\" doctrine from the highest echelons of academia right down to the teaching of primary school children. \n Now, it would be easy to dismiss these hypotheses as simply the rantings of a reactionary obsessive. This is, after all, a man who by his own admission records all the grammatical   ?   he reads or hears. But this is supposedly an eminent member of the linguistic intelligentsia, one of the literati; how can he fail to comprehend the inherent folly of letting nostalgia or social snobbery turn us into priggish purists? Dummett discusses language construction as if the \"rules\" were engraved on one of the tablets that Moses brought down from Mount Sinai. He has obviously yet to embrace the elementary concept that language needs to evolve and be open to change if it is to remain vibrant. Language is not a monolithic entity which is sacrosanct and immune to innovation; language change is a universal characteristic of human behaviour. As linguists Andersson and Trudgill cogently postulate, the English we speak today will probably not be recognisable to any English-speakers a thousand years from now. 3  Language change is simply part of the human condition. \n Unable to establish a sensible symposium, therefore, our dear professor simply resorts to cheap sensationalism in a desperate attempt to stir up a moral panic. His rhetoric becomes sated with alarmist phrases such as  'linguistic pollution'  and  'linguistic immune systems'  as if \"bad\" language is impregnating the system like some sort of inexorable plague. What does this man propose?  \"Linguistic cleansing?\"  Who are he and his ilk to pronounce themselves judge and jury over what constitutes \"good\" language and what constitutes \"bad\" language? As Andersson and Trudgill assert:  'Nothing is good or bad in itself. It is bad only in the eyes of those who evaluate and look at the language.'   4  Everybody should have the right to enrich their language and this is better achieved by presenting alternatives and possibilities than by giving restrictions and prohibitions. Pronouncing judgement upon the merits or inadequacies of other uses of language can only be retrogressive at a time when all the signs indicate that the English language is flourishing. \n Such is the present climate that many native speakers of the English language are actually scared stiff about \"making mistakes\". This is the generation where mercenary companies scurrilously exploit these anxieties with magnanimous promises of linguistic salvation.  'Have you ever been let down by your English?'  they ask.  'Have you ever been ashamed of the way you speak?'  If you have, you can sleep easy in the knowledge that you can send away for their do-it-yourself guides to correct English. \n Is this really the path which Dummett and his cohorts want us to go down? A Utopian Yellow Brick Road with the rhapsodic whimsy of linguistic transcendence at the end? If so, it 's a fool 's paradise. Contrary to Dummett 's protestations, native speakers for the most part do speak their native language perfectly. True, we all make occasional errors from time to time, but this hardly necessitates the sort of cultural backlash that has been whipped up. And if these faux pas become accepted as linguistic norms, so what? Language use can never be frozen in a particular form. As long as a language is used, as long as it lives, it will keep on changing. So if 'creditable' does in time come to replace 'credible', why should we even attempt to resist the transition? Linguistic changes are an inevitable and natural part of all human languages. Those Canutes who attempt to stem the tide of change will inevitably find themselves brushed effortlessly aside. \n This is the axiomatic crux which lies at the heart of my contempt for Mr Dummett. Here is a man who in his unswerving arrogance believes he can actually halt the irresistible linguistic tide. When he harangues about the need for native speakers to resist these external forces on the language, his diatribe even has the alarming resonance of the invidious rhetoric espoused by    jingoistic   nationalists. What this man fails to comprehend is that the language \"purifies\" itself in the same sort of way that nature does. As a dead body or other decaying matter does not last long in the wild, so redundant constructions do not last long in the language. If, as Dummett grumbles, there is a lot of jargon around, it is there for a reason. \n My argument is simply that Dummett 's report of the death of the English language, like the report of Mark Twain 's death, is an exaggeration. There may be profound changes afoot, but they are healthy, manageable, and on the whole beneficial. \n\n\n<$B>\n Response to  The Campaign for Real Grammar.  \n Purging the Purists \n  In last week 's edition of The Oldie, Michael Dummett, Professor of Philosophy at Oxford University, published a plea for a return to the old days of linguistic purity. Arguing that the English of grammar books is in retreat, he believes that unless something is done to reverse this process, we are in danger of becoming straddled with a language that impedes communication rather than encourages it.  \n  \"Like everything else, even mountains, languages change. Unlike mountains, languages are human artefacts; we, their speakers, therefore determine in which respects they change and in which they do not.\"  \n So said the opening of last week 's article in which Michael Dummet argued that we  can  in fact stem the tide of linguistic change. While some changes to language are inadvisable, Dummett argues that other variations are desirable. He places great import on the misuse of the word  \"creditable\"  by an anonymous  \"eminent\"  person on  Channel 4 News,  claiming that this is a prime example of the way that our use of the English language is rapidly deteriorating. Languages, he suggests, are finely tuned instruments and without rules to govern them they become useless as tools of communication, and therefore cannot survive. \n Of course, in the event of every English speaker on the planet suddenly heading off on a tangent and creating their own personal dialect, things would get a little difficult, however, linguistic change is a gradual thing, words and phrases don't just appear from nowhere, but enter our everyday speech in a variety of gradual ways. \n Dummett belongs to the letters page of  The Times,  where it seems that scores of pedants write in to complain about he likes of John Major 's recent misuse of  \"lay\"  for  \"lie\" . What these people seem to be incapable of comprehending is that language is a living breathing thing. By its very nature language  needs  to grow and evolve, it is after all how language developed in the first place. To attempt to stem the flow of linguistic change is to try to halt an ongoing process that dates back to the dawning of intelligent life on the planet. Language is a thing that must be respected, some may argue that this is what Professor Dummett was saying in his article, however, it would only be correct to think of language in terms of being  our  master and not the other way about. \n Professor Dummett cites a letter to the  Independent  from a professor of cultural studies, who stated that in principle, it is impossible for a native language speaker to make a mistake:  \"language consists in whatever native speakers say.\"  Dummett refutes this by asking if this principle extends to young children and if so, at what age does a child become incapable of making a mistake? Noted linguists L.G. Andersson and Peter Trudgill state that  \"children know the basics of the phonological, morphological and syntactic systems of language. These are the central parts of the sound system and the grammar. Other parts of the language take more times to learn, in particular vocabulary and pragmatics....we keep learning vocabulary and situation-specific language all through our lives.\"  We are all guilty of grammatical slip-ups and malapropisms, the sheer volume of talking that we \"perform\" everyday renders even the most eloquent and articulate speaker capable of occasional error. Language is a spontaneous thing, there is very little time to prepare or construct the perfect grammar or vocabulary, when we speak, the sentence that comes out will depend on various factors and we will frequently stall for time with planning elements or fillers like  er, um, eh.  These small particles of speech do not even exist in the written language, they have no meaning and do not add any dignity to the act of speech. Professor Dummett might take note that it is men with an academic education that  er  the most, also making the hardest to interrupt, a skill he has perhaps himself used many times when arguing with linguists. \n Upon reading in last week 's article, that Dummett 's book on  \"correct\"  grammar had been  \"widely welcomed\" , I would have to concede that this is not surprising at all, there is a growing number of people who welcome the idea of a return to Victorian values about  \"correct\"  language, no doubt accompanied by Victorian teaching methods as well, this conjuring up scenes picturing left-handed children with the offending arm tied behind their backs, to ensure that they write as well as speak in a correct manner. \n One point of concession that I would make is that children should be able to use a more formal method of speech when a situation requires it, but not at the expense of their own dialect and slang. We all change our way of speaking according to what situation we find ourselves in, and it is imperative that this ability is not stamped our by an eventual triumph by one dialect, whether it be the Standard English of Professor Dummett or the various types of slang and dialect that he and his supporters so vehemently oppose. \n All language is a beautiful thing, the world would be less interesting if we all spoke the same way. I suggest that Professor Dummett and his like should learn to tolerate if not appreciate the diverse forms of English language that are apparent in the society of today. At the beginning of his article, Dummett states that the tide of linguistic change can be stopped, I would remind him of what happened to King Canute.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "2910c98f-ab52-47d4-a551-1239712826dd", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.528832+00:00"}
{"text": "<Clontarf>\n\n\n<$A>\n  REASONS FOR ANNEXATION  \n There were a number of reasons put forward to explain the annexation of the above townships by Dublin Corporation, with the primary reason being to increase their financial returns, by about 1/3.  8  This would have resulted as all the rates that were being paid to the respective township commissions would have accrued to them. Increases in returns were necessary because the Corporation faced insolvency on a number of occasions in the late nineteenth century and it was for this reason they had to cut back on public projects such as the main drainage scheme in 1877. Staff cutbacks    occurred   shortly afterwards.  9  Such actions underlined the need for increased funds and it was by no coincidence that calls were made for a revaluation at this time. The calls went unheeded however, and the poor financial situation worsened in the 1880's and 1890's. Dublin Corporation showed intense interest in annexing only a few suburbs like Pembroke and Rathmines for the same financial reasons.  10  These highly urbanised suburbs would have yielded revenue that greatly exceeded that of their counterparts of Clontarf, Drumcondra and Kilmainham. \n Yet the arguments of Dublin Corporation on these grounds were perfectly plausible. In 1877 The Royal Commission on Municipal Boundaries made this quite clear. Details were given by the Corporation to the Commission on what services were provided in the city, who benefited from them and who paid for them. Almost every township resident benefited in some way from these Corporation services. The township residents used roads maintained and improved by the Corporation, Public institutions like prisons, workhouses and asylums, and emergency services like hospitals and fire brigades were relied upon by those outside of the city boundary. Dublin Corporation also supplied most of the townships with domestic water supplies.  11  Those residing outside the jurisdiction of Dublin Corporation contributed nothing to the provision of these services despite the fact the vast majority of the suburban residents earned their incomes in the city. These were the primary reasons for the virtual financial insolvency of Dublin Corporation in the late nineteenth century. This situation clearly had to end. \n The second significant reason for the annexation was the need for working class housing in the city. Large numbers of workers lived in squalid tenement housing throughout this period and this problem had to be tackled. The Corporation claimed in order for them to provide the required accommodation  12  it was necessary to move outside of the city as the availability of building land within its pre 1900 confines was limited. This point was contested by many opposed to the annexation who claimed ample space existed within the city in which working class dwellings could be erected, rendering annexation unnecessary for this purpose. This argument gained    credibility   following the examination of the extent of Public housing in the suburbs. An unwillingness was shown by the Corporation to move the working class housing to the suburbs throughout the early years of the twentieth century.  13  Only in 1920's did this end with erection of a large amount of working class housing in Marino.  14  \n An acceptable reason was put forward by Daly, (Mary E.) who claims that the annexation took place purely on Nationalist grounds.  15  The Nationalist Corporation of Dublin were incensed with the demise of the City of Dublin and its replacement by Belfast as the first City of Ireland. Dublin in the late nineteenth century had a smaller population, acreage and valuation than its northern counterpart. However annexation (of all the townships, especially the populous and wealthy townships of Rathmines and Pembroke) would have changed this. Therefore it can be interpreted as a natural reaction by the Nationalist Dublin MPs to try to reinstate their own city to its former position of the Capital of Ireland, and annexation could have accomplished this. But as the townships of Rathmines and Pembroke were not included in the annexation, the exercise did not have the desired effect. It did however increase    substantially   in acreage, but not to any great extent in population or valuation.  16  \n  THE IMPACT OF ANNEXATION ON CLONTARF  \n The annexation of Clontarf was seen by some who inhabited the area as being    desirable   , indeed the township had submitted a petition in favour of annexation containing 400 signatures.  17  This was possibly the same lobby who had attempted to have Clontarf annexed in 1893. Although, this was said to be a small number of publicans who wanted to avail of the more liberal licensing hours in the city, this is somewhat doubtful. There existed in Clontarf a number of property holders who were anxious to see their property retain or even increase in value, and had been intensely frustrated by the obstacles that the township Commission, under the leadership of Vernon maintained and erected to urban development within the township. The same group of property holders doubtless came to the conclusion after almost 25 years of inactivity that if development was to occur in Clontarf, it would do so only in the absence of John E. V. Vernon and C. U. D. C. This led to a petition to the Corporation in favour of annexation in 1893. This did not occur. The Corporation ruled that the township having one mile of agricultural land between it and the city boundaries was not a valid case for annexation.  18  No doubt, the impoverished state of Clontarf due to decades of inactivity made the area a very unattractive proposition as its rateable valuation would fall very short of the costs it would impose on the Corporation. \n Despite, having a number of residents within the township in favour of annexation, there were not surprisingly an equal number opposed to the exercise. Many large land owners in Clontarf threatened to pull out of the area should annexation occur. These landowners included a number of Commissioners from C. U. D. C. Yet this did not occur. Following annexation, a number of interested property developers and speculators entered Clontarf. It is highly likely the lobby who threatened to leave were merely a group of disgruntled Conservatives angry that the more Unionist Township of Clontarf was annexed whilst the less Unionist township of Rathmines and Pembroke were allowed retain their independence. Yet real fears existed amongst some residents that Clontarf would be transformed. Many feared large public housing schemes would be erected in the former township. It was also feared that an increase in rates would occur.  19  Yet, neither did. \n However, change was inevitable. At the same time the Boundaries Extension Bill passed into law, the Clontarf Improvements Bill was also enacted.  20  This bill included provision for the modernisation of Clontarf. It gave commitments by Dublin Corporation to provide the area with all the services it was lacking under the control of C. U. D. C. An enormous task faced the Corporation following annexation. The township of Clontarf was by far the largest of those annexed. Its territory of 1295 acres was more than a third of the former area under the jurisdiction of the Corporation. The infrastructure of the area needed a complete modernisation. Everything from the areas 13 miles of road to the domestic water system needed major reconstruction and improvements. Initially the Corporation appeared zestful with the appointment of a new sanitary officer to maintain  21  and improve the level of public health in the area. The former township was also divided into two wards (East and West) to facilitate the improvements. A boundary was fixed by the Clontarf Urban District Council at Saint Lawrences Road, this was later approved by the Local Government Board. In 1901 the work continued with inspections into the domestic water supply and the leasing of a site from Colonel Vernon for the erection of workmens dwellings. Plans were also laid for a main drainage scheme. \n Despite this zealous beginning, little followed. The investigations carried out by the Corporation illustrated the severity of Clontarf 's problems. Domestic water supplies of the area were delivered through piping of two and four inches in diameter. Piping that was not only too limited in capacity but suffered greatly from corrosion through years of neglect.  22  It was proposed by the Corporation to completely replace the system with nine inch diameter piping which was deemed more suitable. Problems were also realised with the main drainage scheme. The sewage system that according to C. U. D. C. was far more efficient than that of Dublin Corporation merely deposited crude sewage into the foreshore of Clontarf or into cesspools in Clontarf itself. Therefore the expense associated with modernising this existing scheme was considerable. As a result no work was carried out in the earlier years regarding drainage. Dwellings for the working classes were delayed in the early years due to disagreements between a local Committee and the Corporation about the number and type of houses to be constructed.  23  \n Throughout the earlier years of the century progress remained slow. Some improvements were realised such as the construction of new roadways in Philipsburgh Avenue  24  and actions taken to reclaim the slobs.  25  From this period onwards, the Corporation came under increasing criticism from Clontarf residents and Committees. Questions were asked as to why no work had even begun on the projects promised to them under the Clontarf Improvements Bill.  26  Five years after it was enacted, Clontarf 's water supply, drainage and overall dilapidated state remained unchanged. Calls were also made to improve the Clontarf foreshore. The sea shore once popular with bathers from the North City had become polluted to an alarming extent.  27  Raw sewage from virtually all of the populous Dublin suburbs, Drumcondra (via the tolka), Rathmines, Pembroke and Clontarf itself was released into it. Before the completion of the main Dublin Drainage Scheme in 1906,  28  the crude waste of the city of Dublin also found its way here via the Liffey, whose disgraceful state is described below.\n  \"On the state of the Liffey, we held an enquiry which showed that it is polluted to a fearful extent......experiments.... showed that the water was in places so filthy as to cause almost instant death to fish, and the fishermen of the estuary gave us evidence which proved that numbers of salmon have this year been killed by it........ To anyone who had passed along the quays at low water, the poisonous smell of the river, must have proved the absolute necessity of some remedy being quickly applied to this gross evil.\"  29    \n The health hazards created by this pollution were well known by this time and yet little was done by the Corporation to remedy the situation. Repeated calls were made to connect up both Drumcondra and Clontarf to the city scheme  30  following its completion by to little avail. Yet it must be admitted that following the diversion of the city sewerage to Ringsend away from the Clontarf foreshore, the foreshore improved notably. This in turn led to calls for changes to be made to the foreshore in the form of grass enclosures, drinking fountains, public conveniences, footpaths and lighted roadways to derive the full potential from this valuable resource.  31  However the appeals went unheard and no improvements were made. \n Clontarf drainage remained a contentious issue. In 1904, Alderman Tickell reminded the Corporation of their obligation to Clontarf of providing a main drainage scheme.  32  A reply was made stating that research into the geological structure was necessary and was at the time being carried out. In 1905, Dollymount Improvements Association adopted a resolution intimating that a main drainage scheme be adopted immediately. When an advertisement was drawn up by the Corporation seeking tenders for the provision of a main drainage scheme in Clontarf,  33  it appeared that combined efforts of Tickell and Dollymount Residents had proved effective. This was not to be. Despite repeated offers from firstly a Kilkenny builder in 1906 and a Dublin Company in 1907, the Corporation withdrew the advertisement and stated that the work would be carried out by they alone. It was stated that they were unhappy with the low numbers of Irishmen and materials employed by the outside contractors and they refused their services.  34  It would appear that the Corporation were purposefully delaying the project. In 1908, it was disclosed that the main Dublin Drainage Scheme had run into financial difficulties.  35  The cost of the project designed to process all of the sewage generated in the city of Dublin had exceeded the half million pounds allocation. Therefore if finance was unavailable to complete this project, the plan to link up the suburban system of Clontarf and Drumcondra was now out of the question.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "b7409087-0f52-4f26-bc8e-d23a1071ceb1", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.529925+00:00"}
{"text": "<Howth harbour>\n\n\n<$A>\n The Harbour is an important amenity area on the peninsula with thousands of visitors walking its piers during the summer months especially. Unfortunately, this has led to severe traffic congestion during the summer. With limited parking facilities available for visitors, Harbour Road becomes almost impossible. Eric Allen would like to see traffic prohibited along Harbour Road between busy hours, i.e. 2 - 5 p.m. on Sundays, (the busiest day) in summer months. He feels that the pedestrianisation of the area during excessively busy periods, may solve the problem. New housing developments have appeared in recent times also. \"Thormanby Woods\" and \"Woodside\" represent such recent developments. (See Plates 6 and 7) \n \"Thormanby Woods\", off Thormanby Road, represents an \"acceptable\" development receiving no objections. Its location does not obscure any views and it is located far from the main road, i.e. Thormanby Road. The \"Woodside\" development however, was a controversial one, demolishing an old established house and gardens to build a group of modern townhouses. Despite some objections however, the development did go ahead as planned. \n The harbour-front also saw development with the opening of the two restaurants, \"Russells\" and \"Dragon Boat\". A hairdresser, cafe and art shop followed mainly situated on the station end of Harbour Road. \n In more recent times, Sutton Cross has seen a surge of commercial development with a moderate shopping arcade opening on either side of Howth Road. This must represent the realisation that the area could support such development considering the amount of passing trade. Now Sutton Cross represents the greatest density of commercial development on the peninsula. \n   \"Controversy, Uproar, Apprehension\".   \n When one considers recent development in Howth, what comes to mind first is the degree of controversy attached to its recent planning history. The three most notable cases are those involving \"Red Rock\", \"East Mountain\", and \"Howth House\". Before discussing these in detail, we should look at the factors leading to the atmosphere existing in Howth in the late 1980's and early 1990's as regards development. \n Howth is a public area. For thousands of Dublin residents as well as those from further afield, Howth represents an area of recreation. It has a long association with recreation and bathing, going back to the 18th Century. Any development which would effect the recreational value of Howth, is not only resisted by Howth 's residents, but by its thousands of visitors. \n Howth is an affluent area. It has, as residents, a large number of well educated middle and upper middle-class residents. This social group tends to have more time available to it for taking an active interest in planning conflicts and environmental issues. They also tend to be more aware of their rights regarding development in their area and have the resources to pursue such rights. \n After what had happened in Sutton in the 1960's with most of its open spaces being developed for residential use, a certain air of apprehension was present in Howth. Howth represented the last bastion of large open spaces available for recreation in North East Dublin. \n The \"1980 Dublin City Development Plan\" had given Howth a special mention highlighting its recreational importance in the eyes of the Corporation. \n  \"Generally the policy relating to Howth is to maintain the character of the village, the outstanding natural amenity areas and attractive features of the peninsula. Future development shall be strictly related to the indicated use zones including the infilling of existing developed areas rather than further extension of these areas. Tracts of open land, including Ireland 's Eye, will be preserved so as to maintain the natural scenic character of the area. Development will be strictly controlled in visually prominent areas and in existing undeveloped areas\".  \n(1980 Dublin City Development Plan; 2.10.6.)\n Pat McCarton cited Bull Island as a  \"good example of Dublin Corporations capacity to appreciate and to protect scenic areas.\"  \n Howth was given to the Co. Council Planning Department in 1986, through political    manoeuvring   at Department of Environment level. The Howth residents did not have any say in the matter.  \"Even the Corporation\"  emphasises Eric Allen,  \"were opposed to giving up Howth because they had long term plans for the area and they understood Howth and had a working relationship with Howth\".  The Local Authority Act in 1985, resulted in Howth becoming part of the large county area, Dublin - Fingal. Michael O'Neill stated that he felt that the importance of Howth was considered minor in the context of the county as a whole, by the Co. Council and that they did not  \"attach the same importance to its value as an amenity space for Dubliners\".  \n Thus, a resentment of the Co. Council was evident amongst Howth conservationists from the very beginning. \n This resentment was to be deepened in the years to follow owing to three highly publicised planning conflicts which shook the Howth peninsula. \n   \"The Red Rock Affair\".   (See Map 3 in Appendix for location.) \n The first and probably the most infamous of development proposals in Howth, was the proposed developments on Red Rock. Two separate applications, on adjoining plots in the Red Rock area, were made in the recent history of Howth. \n The first \"battle\" goes back to 1953, when the then Minister for Local Government, Paddy Smith, decided to grant permission over the head of the Dublin Corporation, for a housing development on the 16 acre site. The scheme for up to 29 houses was never implemented and the site was sold 10 years later to Mr. Thomas O'Reilly, a Rathgar builder. \n Under the 1976 Local Authority (Planning and Development) Act, all planning permission which had not previously been implemented, were invalid by November 1st, 1981. But this was extended by 12 months by the Minister for the Environment leading to a rush to develop sites whose planning permission would be revoked in 1982. \n Mr. O'Reilly, through his company, Family Properties Ltd., applied for planning permission for a residential development of the 16 acre site. But so determined was Dublin City Council to prevent development in this scenic area, that it decided to revoke the 1953 ministerial permission. \n Mr. O'Reilly appealed to Bord Pleanala in June 1982, but the board confirmed the    Corporation 's   decision. <#>\n Family Properties Ltd. then exercised its right to serve a \"Purchase Notice\" on the Corporation, requiring it to purchase its 16 acre site, the price being decided by an arbitrator. It also claimed over two million pounds in compensation for loss of development rights. \n In 1986, amidst the conflict, the site fell under the jurisdiction of the Co. Council, which had adopted the role of Howth 's planning authority. The Council found itself facing a huge compensation claim from Family Properties Ltd. \n The council decided to conduct discussions with the company involved to reach a suitable solution.    The   agreement, put forward to the elected member of Dublin County Council was compromising, to say the least. \n Under the agreement, the 16 acre site was valued at a lower figure of <*> pound sign </*> 809,000. The Council agreed to purchase eight acres of the land for <*> pound sign </*> 250,000. In the 1980 Dublin City Development Plan, 8 acres of the site was zoned for residential development and 8 acres for high amenity. The County agreed to purchase the amenity-zoned land. For the other 8 acres, it agreed to grant planning permission for a residential development scheme by Mr. O'Reilly. If the board overturned the Council 's decision to grant permission, the agreement stipulated that Family Properties Ltd. would receive in exchange for its 8 acre site, a Council site of equal value (<*> pound sign </*> 550,000). This marked the beginning of the compensation-avoiding compromises which would be made time and time again. An Bord Pleanala overturned the Council 's decision, once again saving the scenic area from development. \n In March 1989, Mr. O'Reilly agreed to hand over his 16 acres of land to the County Council in return for the <*> pound sign </*> 250,000 and an additional <*> pound sign </*> 550,000 if they failed to provide him with an alternative 8 acres. \n In November 1988, a new threat to the Red Rock site manifested itself in the form of Flambeau Ltd. Two local residents, Paul Power and Aidean Crowe, purchased a 46 acre site, adjoining the O'Reilly site. Their company Flambeau, aimed to develop a residential area on the site and applied for full planning permission. The Flambeau site was zoned for amenity use in the 1980 Dublin City Development Plan. In March 1989, the Council refused planning permission for the proposed development, saying that it would be  \"seriously injurious to the preservation of views and prospects across the site to Baldoyle and Portmarnock\".  \n(Irish Times 5/3/89). \n The Council also saw a danger to public safety arising from the development by:  \"creating a traffic hazard through the opening up of shared access to the six houses on St. Fintan 's Road which is currently defined as sub-standard\".  \n(Irish Times 5/3/89). \n By taking care to cite several particular reasons why development could not be permitted such as the risk to public safety, the Council removed any prospect of Flambeau demanding any compensation claim; which might have been sought even though the development materially contravened the development plan. \n An appeal was made to Bord Pleanala by Flambeau Ltd and almost a year later, the Board finally made its decision confirming the County Council 's earlier ruling. So once again, Red Rock had survived. \n The amount of interest which this case had gathered in the region, was quite    extraordinary   \n Among the organisations who opposed the development of Red Rock, were the Baily Residents Association, Howth; Glencarrig Residents Association, Sutton; The Howth and Sutton Residents Association; The Strand Road Residents Association and of course, An Taisce. \n An unusual factor in Bord Pleanala 's decision in the Flambeau case, is recalled by Michael O'Neill;  \"It was decided that the environmental quality of St. Finton 's Road would be taken away from the development. This is the only occasion I have ever seen the Board consider the environmental quality of a road in a planning appeal decision\".  \n  \"The McGuinness Development\".  (See Map 3). \n The Red Rock cases acted as a  \"testing of the new boy\"  in the sense that they represented the County Council 's first two important planning decisions on the peninsula. With regards to public opinion, they had fared averagely. They had bowed down to compensation threats in the Family Properties decision, but had stood firm in the Flambeau ruling. \n Red Rock had also resulted in the formation of an army of pressure groups ready to defend their local area from the  \"evils of development\".  Red Rock had seen these mobilise in the form of protest marches. The publicity which the conflict had achieved had resulted in conversation being on a growing number of local residents. \n In June 1989, permission was sought by a local builder, Michael Hayes, for the demolition of a cottage situated on the East Mountain and for its replacement with a new residence. It later emerged that Mr. Hayes was  \"fronting\"  for Mr. Gerry McGuinness, the founder of the \"Sunday World\" newspaper. The application plans revealed that the proposed \"replacement\" residence for the cottage, consisted of a  \"ranch-style luxury house\",  (Irish Times 15th September, 1989), containing an  \"open-air swimming pool\".  Nonetheless, the development received planning permission in mid August. This decision was unusual especially with regards to the County Council Planning Officers ' decision. Ms. Grainne Mallon, who dealt with the application, decided that no  \"material contravention\"  of the 1980 Dublin City Development Plan would exist if permission was given. Considering that the only residential development which would not constitute a  \"material contravention\"  would be a \"replacement\" of the existing structure, it seems inconceivable that such a  \"ranch-style luxury home\"  could have been deemed a \"replacement\" residence for a humble cottage. Public outrage followed. A public protest walk to the East Mountain and the formation of an East Mountain Action Group, conveyed the public opinion to the Co. Council 's decision, to allow development of the unspoilt corner of Howth. Ms. Mallon 's decision to grant permission, was severely criticised by many. Michael O'Neill calls the ruling a  \"disgraceful decision, which evaded and avoided many of the    procedures   built into the development plan process\".  He    suggests   that the mandatory newspaper advertisement to inform the public of the development, did not comply with the 1977 Planning Regulations. It did not give the name of the applicant, the location of the land, the address of the structure or the nature and extent of the development.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "08a8707f-94a4-4eb6-ba59-06dcc8c09f92", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.530956+00:00"}
{"text": "<Interpretive centres>\n\n\n<$A>\n  6.1  Results\n(a) Wildlife Service, O.P.W.  \n Clara Bog is in State ownership by this State Body so the proposed interpretative centre will be overseen by them. They are now awaiting E.C. structural funds to continue with their plans. \n Speaking at a public meeting in the Parochial Hall on Tuesday, 3rd September 1991, where there were a large number of profile people from the tourism and scientific community in both Ireland and the Netherlands, Mr. Eamonn Grennan, an agriculturalist with the National Parks and Wildlife Service for O.P., pledged that the interpretative and study centre would be established in Clara when the funds are available. He added that there was a tremendous amount of goodwill towards the setting up of a centre by the local people, and he believed that this was the first step towards putting Clara on the map as far as tourist facilities were concerned. \n  \"Such a centre would be built when the monies become available, but there is a commitment for this centre to go ahead.\"  \n The W.S. are presently actively pursuing the matter of acquiring a site and hope to come to a decision very shortly. When the site has been acquired, the commitment for the centre will be firmer still, Mr. Grennan added: \n As early as May 1990, Ms. Noreen O'Keeffe of the Wildlife Service told \"The Offaly Independent\" that the interpretative centre would be located in the town of Clara and it would not be a bog location. At this time, they hoped that progress would be made before the end of the year. However, due to governmental cutbacks, the plans are still suspended. The Wildlife Service hope that when the centre is built it would act as a focus for peatland conservation, promoting an awareness of the great botanical and zoological heritage of Irish bogs, particularly Clara Bog.    They   hope to provide an audio-visual display in the centre also. \n A board walk 1,200m in length is to be erected at the bog in the very near future. The idea was mooted by Mr. Grennan and T. Dolan as a firm step towards the provision of an interpretative centre. Offaly Co. Council are also involved in arranging a location for the centre at Clara. They will incorporate the W.S. 's plans into their Development Plan for Co. Offaly. \n   (b) The Irish Wildlife Federation (I.W.F.)   \n This organisation was involved in saving Clara Bog from development by Bord na Mona in 1986. As part of Ireland 's contribution to the European Environmental Bureau 's E.Y.E. Projects, the I.W.F. organised a National Conservation workday on the bog in August 1987 and the group 's President, Fergus O'Gorman, called on all members to come and help \"Groundwork\" with the drain filling. Over 150 came from all over the country. Their aims according to their President is: \n  \"To conserve Irish Wildlife, e.g., Clara Bog by developing public awareness, especially amongst young people through educational programmes.\"  \n   (c) The Irish Peatland Conservation council (I.I.C.C.)   \n The I.P.C.C. was established in 1982 during the National Bog Conservation week, held by An Taisce. The members of the organisation are persons from different institutes and State bodies. They promote a peatland conservation programme in Ireland and encourage the preservation of a representative series Irish peatlands. They also encourage State and Semi-State organisations involved in peatland development to acknowledge the conservation and amenity of such ecosystems. The committee have included Clara Bog in their List of International Importance, and applied to the E.C. for funds to secure the complete preservation of Clara Bog. A fund of <*> pound sign </*> 650,000 per year was provided for acquisition of reserves under the Wildlife Act. \n They support the idea of an interpretative centre depending on the location.\n   (d) The Dutch/Irish Project on Clara Bog   \n This project and the nature of the research is discussed in Section 5.4. (and will end in 1992). Dr. Matthijs Schouten is a renowned environmentalist with the Dutch contingent and has made Ireland his second home. Mr. Eric Ch. Niehe, Dutch Ambassador to Ireland also addressed the meeting in Clara last September. They both made some interesting points and observations at the meeting of which I have included the main points. \n Mr. Niehe talked about the great concern of some Dutch people for the conservation of Irish bogland, which is long since eaten away in Holland. They had actually purchased tracts of Irish bogland in the hope of preserving it. In an article in \"The Offaly Independent\" (Date: 16th September 1991) he says: \n  \"Bogs are not of interest only to peat diggers, but to scientists, tourists, even ambassadors and Presidents. (President Hillary visited the bog last year).\"  \n His Dutch companion, Dr. Schouten is founding chairman of the Dutch Foundation for the Conservation of Bogs and is a familiar figure in Clara, having first put the bog on the agenda for preservation. He gave a comprehensive exposition on the concept of what has now become \"Green Tourism\" or \"Eco-tourism\". Assets in green tourism, he noted, were usually not easily accessible, unlike much visited sites, e.g., Westminster, Acropolis, etc., which were centrally located because of their function. Also, places in the green tourism sector were not self explanatory, he said: \n  \"If you dump a tourist in the bog firstly, he does not know where to go. Therefore, some form of interpretation is needed.\"  \n He went on to say that a feature of green tourism sites was their low carrier capacity. Eco-tourism was only just emerging and yet damage has already been done to places like the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and nature reserves near Kilimanjaro in Africa, because of an over-concentration of tourists. At the same time, he stressed that he was not trying to discourage anyone in Clara promoting the bog for tourism - he was merely stating that careful planning was essential. \n  \"The idea of a quick buck can be a catastrophe for green tourism, it 's a longterm thing.\"  \n Mr. Schouten describes four type of green tourist. The first type he labelled the  \"cup of tea and a snap-shot\"  tourist who would travel Europe in seven days, spending only very little time in each area. Secondly, there is the main grouping which he called the  \"I want the experience, but with    not too much effort please\"  tourists. They would spend a couple of hours on a site in an organised tour, and would be reluctant even to don Wellingtons. Thirdly, there is the \"explorer\" type of green tourist who would spend up to a day on a site, has a keen interest in wildlife and would walk and cycle. Finally, there is the  \"true tourist\"  types who are amateur scientists and would spend their entire holiday on one site. \n Dr. Schouten continues to say at this meeting, how large numbers of tourists should be handled when they come to Clara. An Interpretative Centre is crucial, he says, so that visitors would know what they are seeing; otherwise there would be bad publicity for Clara in their home country. \n Such a centre should be built away from the heart of the area of focus, perhaps in the town of Clara, so that the tourists would be \"trapped\". It should also, in his opinion, feature the bog and esker and be staffed by local guides, such as those presently working for the Eiscir Riada and Clara Bog Tour Group. They would guide three and four types of tourist. As regards the bog itself, he suggests opening up the least vulnerable part and recommended that all visitors not be concentrated on the same spot. \n Furthermore, the different types of tourist should not be accommodated in the same place. He adds that very wide and raised walkways would protect the bog and discourage littering and could lead to an area appropriate for a snapshot. The carpark would have to separate from the bog. The trail should begin at the esker, he notes, continuing onto a high site suitable for a photograph and then leading onto the bog by means of walkways. \n He also recommends a trail for cycles so that all four types could then be catered for adequately. The other amenities that would follow from the centre would include the following: Bed and breakfast, plus restaurant and tearooms, a cycle rent shop and a small library. He stresses that tourists would only come to Clara with good marketing, and information on the town should be sent to Irish and foreign wildlife magazines and green tour operators. An annual event would also have to be held and Clara had this with its \"Queen of the Heather Festival\" which mixed education and entertainment. \n Mr. Donal Daly is a hydro-geologist with the Irish contingent of the project. He would like to see the centre located in the town of Clara for a number of reasons. Worldwide, they are finding that when you locate a centre in the middle of a nature reserve, that it can be very damaging and that they are now being removed. Also the question of sewage and where it will leave the bog would be a potential problem. He    believes   that people do not want to see massive artefacts. He hails Clara as:\n \"One of the most important intact raised bogs in Western Europe.\"  \n He would like to see Clara Bog as part of an overall Offaly tourist package, including the Slieve Blooms, Clonmacnoise, Mary 's Church in Pullogh and Lockes Distillery in Kilbeggan. \n   (e) The Clara Bog Development Association (C.B.D.A.)   \n This community group grew out of the \"Queen of the Heather Festival\" in 1982. The popularity of these trips increased with as many as 500-600 attending them over the week-end excursions. One was entitled \"Clara Bog and Esker Day\". In the early 1980's, they lobbied to save the bog and succeeded in forcing the State to buy the bog. The work of the C.B.D.A. received recognition on several occasions in the last two years. Firstly, they were short listed in the Ford European Conservation Awards. Then, in February 1991, the Bank of Ireland Local Hero Awards paid tribute to their efforts to increase public awareness about Clara Bog. They were given <*> pound sign </*> 1,000 by the Department of the Environment for this and the money is going towards building the board-walk over the bog. \n Mr. Michael Pettit and Tommy Dolan are two prominent members of the C.B.D.A. \n  \"Our observations are that while it is advisable to bring people onto the bog, it is not advisable to damage it in any way.\"  \n Both members agree that local unemployment in the town is very high. All businesses including their own would be grateful for increased profit and security in the future. The chemist and bar/grocery shops owned by both, as well as the bakery/coffee shop on the main street are likely to benefit if the centre were to be located in the town. The local concern about the bog 's future has been noticeable especially with increased media coverage over the last 5 years. This concern is reflected in the large attendance numbers at the meetings and the amount of local involvement in the annual events to encourage people to Clara. \n  (f) Bord F&/ailte   \n Mr. Martin Dully is Chief Executive with Bord F&/ailte. He made some comments at the meeting last September in Clara, of which I will now include. Firstly, he detailed the need to protect Clara Bog and esker and at the same time promoting it for tourism. He said that there was a delicate balance between a growing economy, the need for jobs and the need to share the beauty of Ireland with our European partners and others, and the need to protect the bog from  \"tourism of a vandalistic nature\".  Mr. Dully, a native of Athlone reflected in how a terrain which had formerly been perceived as  \"inflicted\"  on the people, had now assumed such importance. In an article in \"The Offaly Independent\" (9/9/91) he says:\n \"None of us had the inspiration, or education, or insight, to see bogs as a botanist 's heaven. The like of David Bellamy and Dr. Schouten highlighted it for the Irish.\"", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "142060ad-294d-4a03-b78e-612d981099b5", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.531913+00:00"}
{"text": "<Louth farming>\n\n\n$A>\n  CHAPTER 111  \n  PART-TIME FARMING  \n Part-time farming is a term which is very hard to get an adequate definition for. Official figures in recording part-time farmers underestimate the amount that there are. \nThere are two main ways to look at the term;\n(1) to do with source of income (2) to do with amount of labour time\n The established full working year on a farm is 275 days. Irish figures for part-time farming tend to be based on labour and they take into account any adult worker on the farm, not just the owner-occupier. This leads to confusion between part-time farmers and part-time farms. \n In Ireland a farm is only seen to be a part-time farm for official    statistics   if it is the farmer who works for a certain period off the farm. But if the wife works off the farm then it is not seen as a part-time farm. \n Up to the mid 1980's part-time farming wasn't really important in Ireland. But since 1985 with the introduction of C.A.P. part-time farming has been a transitional Phenomenon in Ireland and that it arose because of the process of commercialisation in Ireland. Before this we had the idea of full Time farms. These farms had enough means by itself to    sustain   the household. It had enough labour to occupy the owner and his sons as well. This ideal changed with commercialisation of agriculture and in the increased competition and struggles in farming. \n Research in America says that it has discovered four distinct groups of farmers (some overlap).\n1. People (hobby farmers) \u00d0 bought into farming. 2. Farmers retired and no direct heir-running down enterprise. 3. Aspiring \u00d0 route into eventual full Time farming. 4. Chronic part-time \u00d0 perhaps once hoped to become full time farmers and have given up. Also may be people who have access to work both on the farm and off it and they want to keep it this way. \n The farmers in the Cooley Peninsula mainly fit into category four now. Many of them have access to work both on and off the farm. But this will be discussed in detail later on. \n It has been seen that the size of the farm in relation to part time farming is related to the type of the other occupation. For example the larger the farm the less likely that the owner 's (other job) would be that of an employee. It has been found that two thirds were employers or self employed. \n In Part Time farming there is the case that where one member leaves the farm then there is an increase in work for the other workers. The effect of this may mean a change in the line of work the farmer was engaged in. But this does not necessarily mean a decrease in farm productivity. Also the income from the off farm work may in many cases be ploughed back into the farm, so as to improve the farm. Much of the off the farm work helps to maintain the farm. \n Part time farming has in the past meant that a farmer devoted some time often on a seasonal basis to off farm work. The percentage of part time farmers will increase as the country becomes more industrialized with an increase in the percentage of farm land owned by part time    farmers.   \n\n This shows that many farmers in Louth work off the farm for a period of time during the year. These figures will have increased over the past 14 years. There would be an increase in part-time farmers. In the transition from an agricultural to an industrial economy there is an increase in the proportion of part time farmers, whether they are farmers who supplement farm earnings with off farm employment or non farmers who buy land. \n Rural Industrialisation has had a great impact on farming. It has been seen to be the way of providing a new source of work, and income and also to enable farmers to farm more effectively and increase their farm output. Industrial earnings tend to be    ploughed   back into the farm. The farmer is able to improve his equipment and his facilities which in turn enables him to improve the farm. \n The impact of part-time farming can be seen in the Cooley Peninsula. Many of the farmers here have branched into another activity in order to improve their standards of living. But most of the extra income that they earn is ploughed back into the farm in order to make the farm more productive and better able to withstand the pressure and competition from within the farming community as a whole. \n  AGRICULTURAL POLICY  \n In the mid 1980's the European Community 's agricultural Policy was in need of change. This policy is know as C.A.P. or Common    Agricultural   Policy. The reason for change was partly because of the costs of marketing, but also the extent of surplus and costs in trying to manage these was another consideration. \n The food mountain of the E.E.C. were causing major problems. In the past the E.E.C. controlled these food mountains by adding new international markets to the E.E.C. But these markets were no longer available to the E.C. BECAUSE THEY WERE OVER SATURATED. \n For the first time there were many strong pressure groups outside the agricultural sector. The E.E.C. were planning for 1992, and the idea of free trade. This was another reason why the C.A.P. had to be changed. \n In 1985 the problem of food mountains was eased slightly as butter was sold to Russia and there was new meat markets in the East 1/2 \n The C.A.P. change was brought about by pressure from America through the G.A.T.T. talks. There has been more vocal    criticism   in the last couple of years particularly in the way the C.A.P. preferred the larger producers than the smaller ones. Many small farmers have been forced out of farming. This factor in farming can be clearly seen in the Cooley Peninsula as now there are little or no small farmers in the commercial market. All the larger farmers in the area have either    bought   the land of the small farmers or are renting the land. \n There has been massive technological changes in agriculture. These changes are related to overall state strategies in the managing of agriculture. The technological change can be seen in the Cooley Peninsula in many ways. One can see that most of the farmers have most farm machinery available to them. Every one of the farmers in the survey I conducted had more than one tractor and a combine    harvester.   Many of them had ploughs, sowers, balers etc. \n  PART-TIME FARMING ACTIVITIES IN THE COOLEY PENINSULA  \n The Peninsula can become the 'gem' of Europe, if the potential for growth in    many   areas can be harnessed into one all    embracing   programme and    receiving   adequate resources through the structural funds. \n The growth area include;\n(1) Agriculture (2) Horticulture (3) Tourism (4) Forestry (5) Transport and Storage (6) Fishing (7) Food Industry \n It is clear when studying the area that the farmers are changing their agricultural practices. They are specialising in many areas and many are involved in part-time activities. This has happened because farming has now become so competitive that farmers need to change their strategies in order to survive. \n  AGRICULTURE  \n Agriculture in the area can be greatly improved. Over the last two decades new strains of grain which are better adapted to the soils of the area have been bred. These grains are now being used in the area so crop yields are now much higher. New and improved sprays and fertilisers are being manufactured every few years and these are improving the yields of crops significantly. New breeds of cattle and Sheep are being discovered and being used. These new cattle and sheep are better able to withstand diseases \n\n As can be seen from this table farmers are realising the potential that sheep have in the area. The overall number of sheep in the area has increased quite dramatically in the space of three years i.e. from 30,450 in 1986 to 62,000 in 1989. Also the number of flock owners has increased. The hilly areas in Cooley are very suitable for sheep. \n\n These numbers have increased since    then.   A large number of the sheep owners are in the Cooley peninsula. This is because the area is suitable for sheep rearing. But this potential can be increased even further in the future. The sheep farmers in the area have a group known as the Sheep Farmers Association and this group is very important in the managing of sheep. The importance of groups in farming has been discussed in the literary section. \n In the Cooley Peninsula there is a livestock premium and headage scheme in operation. This is important to the farmers in the area. All the sheep and cattle farmers have to be registered herd owners of 18 years of age and over. If the    area   is disadvantaged then the farmer will receive higher grants from the government. The Cooley area has some disadvantaged areas i.e. the hills and the mountains so they receive slightly over the average grant for cattle. Ewe premiums are the same all over the country and this is dependant on the difference between reference price and average market price for a marketing year. In 1991 lowland premium was expected to be <*> pound sign </*> 20/ewe with <*> pound sign </*> 3.45 extra in severely handicapped areas. \n As can be seen agriculture is widely developed in the area but the potential for better development is there. Government grants can also help the area. \n  HORTICULTURE  \n Nationally we imported 48 million pounds worth of Horticultural produce in 1987. In the seven years between 1978 and 1985, the import of apples rose by 20,000 tonnes, onions by 9,000 tonnes and tomatoes by 8,000 tonnes. If natural gas was made available to Irish growers at the price available to Dutch growers in Holland, tomato production could be expanded to reduce the level of imports. With proper investment, we could grow the major share of the 17 million worth of imported apples. Fashionable vegetables could be produced at home. \n An example of what can be done when the right tactics are adopted is very evident in Mushroom growing. Fresh mushrooms to the value of 7 million pounds were exported in 1985, as a result in the establishment of growing centres and    satellite   growers based on the family unit. This factor can be seen in the Cooley Peninsula. There are two major mushroom growers in the area. These growers received government grants to set up their industry and now they are very successful. They employ many local people and they export to markets both at home and abroad. \n This is an example of a part-time activity which a farmer may go into. The two mushroom industry owners are both ordinary farmers as well. One of them is a sheep farmer with a small amount of tillage activities and the other one is a tillage farmer. \n In the Cooley Peninsula there is an ever-increasing number interested in all areas of horticulture production. The area offers a fruitful and productive zone for horticultural training and for field trials on family farms. \n If horticultural production is to flourish, then those involved must be highly skilled, must co-operate with each other, must find better and more economic methods of production and above all must be aware of consumer needs. This can only be achieved by proper training. Teagasc provides many courses for this training in the area and over the years many more people have undergone this course and have started growing horticultural produce as a result.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6c112c08-d112-40cc-a75c-2ea3fabf5d2d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.532928+00:00"}
{"text": "<Dublin housing>\n\n\n<$A>\n  The Dublin Improvement Scheme 1877  \n Upon receipt of the above reports, the Public Health Committee of the Corporation, of which Mr. E. Dwyer Gray was chairman, promptly acted and constituted an Artisans Dwellings Committee. A scheme was devised under the Artisans and Labourers Dwellings Improvement Act 1875, for the improvement of two unhealthy areas in the city. Of the twelve areas reported on by Dr. Mapother and Parke Neville C.E., the Committee decided on the Elbow Lane area (hereafter referred to as the Coombe area) and the Boyne Street area as the most suitable to be dealt with at that time. Some of the other areas were in a worse sanitary condition but various difficulties stood in the way of their being cleared. It was found for example that the Bull Lane Area, which the Committee was very anxious to deal with, would cost a very large sum owing to the number of licensed houses and other valuable property that would have to be purchased. The Committee finally settled on these two areas after consultation with the Artisans Dwellings Company who was to build upon the sites and whose opinion therefore, carried great weight with the Committee. \n In 1879 Dr. Mapother again reported on the unhealthy condition of the Plunkett Street area and recommended an Improvement scheme. At the same time the Artisans and Labourers Dwellings Committee decided to postpone proceedings with the Boyne Street area until their proceedings in the Coombe were nearer completion. The following year the Boyne Street area was abandoned. This was largely because the loan taken out to pay for the original two schemes of the Coombe and Boyne areas had been used entirely on the Coombe scheme. Also there had been a decrease in the number of dwellings and in the population of the Boyne Street area. In 1876 the area contained eighteen habited and eight uninhabited dwellings, occupied by ninety five people. In 1880 there were eight dwellings remaining, occupied by fifty eight people. Five of these dwellings were in the process of being closed because of their condition. In effect the area had been cleared, although it would not now benefit in the way the Coombe area did. The Plunkett Street Area was thought to be more suited to a clearance scheme and it received the Royal Assent in August 1880. (R.P.D.C.D.1880 Vol. 2.) \n  Area 1 - The Coombe  \n This included the entire district, bounded on the south by the Upper Coombe, on the west by Pimlico, on the north by Cole Alley and on the east by Meath Street. It was a much more extended area than that reported on by the Medical Officer and the City Engineer, but the Committee felt justified in extending the boundaries for purposes of widening roadways and for ventilation and the extended area also included houses and yards which were in an equally    unsanitary   state as those in the above reports. \n The Coombe area seemed an attractive site. Although the area was large, much of it was unoccupied and it did not contain either factories or licensed premises and so it was thought that the site would be acquired at a moderate cost. At the beginning of the nineteenth century manufacturers of cotton, linen, starch and many tradesmen lived in the area but by 1878 when the ground was purchased there was not a single merchant, manufacturer or trader in the entire area. (R.P.D.C.D. 1884 Vol.2;69) It was an open area and was not densely populated. Before it was cleared it contained 110 dwellings and about 380 separate tenancies with a population of 984, which was equal to about 46 per acre. In fact the population of this area increased to 1,100 when new homes were built in the area. \n The area formed a part of what was formerly called \"The Liberty\", which prior to 1840 was not under the jurisdiction of the Corporation and consequently did not pay city rates. The portion of ground taken was the property of the Earl of Meath who was the owner in fee and many leases for lives renewable for ever had been made by his predecessors towards the end of the seventeenth century. Before the arbitrator some of the claimants asserted a right to the fee for which the Earl of Meath had already been compensated; they grounded their claims on the statute of limitations only, alleging that they had not for over fifty years paid rent to anyone - the representatives of the original leases of 1691 did not know that they should have had possession of those grounds and houses until they were so informed by the Corporation. \n The Corporation paid very dearly for the property, because although it was required for public purposes it had to be purchased at market value. Seven property owners dissented from the proposed scheme under the impression that by \"dissenting\" from the proposal they would get more money for their property than if they had \"assented\". The compensation for trade disturbance was very large although in many cases the business was moved only a few yards away from the original locality and was little if at all prejudiced or damaged by the move. For example a dairy owner who had been awarded <*> pound sign </*> 164 by the arbitrator was awarded <*> pound sign </*> 200 by a jury and <*> pound sign </*> 550 for trade disturbance although he later established a very fine yard at the upper end of Blackpitts in the immediate neighbourhood of the Coombe. A green-grocer who had been awarded <*> pound sign </*> 315 by the arbitrator was awarded <*> pound sign </*> 350 by a jury for the value of premises and <*> pound sign </*> 250 for trade disturbance. She opened a new shop immediately afterwards within a couple of doors of her former shop. (R.P.D.C.D. 1884 Vol. 2 No 170) \n The total cost to the Corporation was <*> pound sign </*> 24,367 12s.10d., of which <*> pound sign </*> 15,983 19s. 8d. was paid in compensation. The area contained about four acres and the total government valuation was <*> pound sign </*> 424, so that the purchase of the property cost at the rate of about 3,800 per acre, or nearly thirty-eight years purchase on the government valuation. \n The weekly tenants were allowed by the arbitrator six months purchase on their weekly rents and the Earl of Meath 's title was purchased for <*> pound sign </*> 3,038 2s. 5d., equal to about fourteen years purchase on the rental he received from this property. The loans taken up by the Corporation to carry the scheme into effect were repayable within fifty years with interest at the rate of three and a half per cent. (R.P.D.C.D. 1884 Vol. 2;95) \n Having acquired and cleared the area the Corporation granted a lease of it for 10,000 years to the Dublin Artisans Dwellings Company at a rent of <*> pound sign </*> 200 per year. The Corporation was anxious that a company with objectives similar to its own should lease the area. Granting a lease to one company rather than to several individuals, even though the Company would pay less rent, had two main advantages. Firstly the Corporation and citizens were sure to get the rent and taxes due, and there was less danger of the condition of the houses deteriorating it was in the interest of the company to maintain or repair the property in order to pay a dividend. Secondly, where an area is let out to several individuals some are liable to build inferior houses, to neglect repairs and finally the houses begin to deteriorate and to decrease in value, resulting in a vacation of the properties and a loss of rates. Although under the Act of 1875 Dublin Corporation was authorized to rebuild on the area, once the houses were sold within ten years, at this time it was considered more desirable that the    Corporation   limit their activities to the less restrictive practice of purchasing areas and selling or letting the ground for the building of homes for the working class. \n The Dublin Artisans Dwellings Company was well respected and negotiations took place between the Company and Dublin Corporation. It was agreed that the roads and footpaths would be curbed and asphalted by the Corporation, who would also be responsible for the sewerage and the laying of the water mains. The Company was to spend at least <*> pound sign </*> 20,000 on building artisans dwellings on the site, subject to the approval of the Corporation. \n The Company spent <*> pound sign </*> 27,600 on building 210 houses, six of which were used as shops and two being occupied by caretakers - in all housing a population of 1,100. \n Four classes of houses were built on the site. Ninety two one-storey cottages containing one living room and one or two bedrooms were built of Portland cement concrete and had a scullery, coalhouse and privy with a yard at the back opening onto a cleansing passage. They were built at an average cost of <*> pound sign </*> 82.10s One hundred and fourteen two-storey houses, containing two living rooms and two bed rooms or one large sitting room and two bed rooms were built at an average cost of <*> pound sign </*> 165 and <*> pound sign </*> 115 each respectively. The front and end walls of the houses were of red brick and the partition and yard walls of concrete. Four houses of three storeys were built to be used as shops. Each house had its own water supply, brought in from the back via the cleansing passage. The surfaces of the yards were laid in concrete so that  \"no foul matter could percolate into the earth\".  (R.P.D.C.D. 1884 Vol. 2;97) \n The Company received 3s.6d. and 4s. per week rent for the one storey cottages, 6s.6d and 7s per week for the two storey houses and 5s.6d. for the three-roomed houses,    totalling   <*> pound sign </*> 2,680 per annum. These rents were quite high and it is clear that the Artisans Dwelling Company catered for the more prosperous and more securely employed sections of the working class. Of the 202 tenants only 61 were labourers, with the remainder belonging to the skilled working class with a few members of the lower middle class. For example there were eight carpenters, seven tailors, three clerks and two cab owners. 107 of the families came from streets within a half-mile radius of the Coombe, 53 from streets immediately adjoining, 25 from the north side of the city and 17 from the suburbs. It was found that the houses and tenements in the vicinity that were vacated by the new Coombe tenants were re-occupied by a lower class of artisans, tradespeople and labourers and it was argued that a sort of levelling up process was taking place, with the lower strata also benefiting by moving into better tenements. (R.P.D.C.D. 1884 Vol 2.. No 150) \n The Coombe Area scheme was generally considered to be a success. The houses were of a high standard with good sanitary facilities and were never untenanted. There was a notable decrease in the death rate. From June to December 1883 there were only 11 deaths none of which were infectious. At a public inquiry in April 1877, prior to the authorization of the scheme, Dr. Grimshaw listed the Coombe area as one where fever and cholera prevailed. Looking at it from a monetary point of view, there was a gain to the ratepayers. Prior to the scheme, total rates from the area averaged <*> pound sign </*> 65. In 1883 total rates paid was <*> pound sign </*> 611. The government valuation of the area also increased dramatically. In 1876 the Coombe Area was valued at <*> pound sign </*> 424 and in 1883 it was valued at <*> pound sign </*> 1,429.15.0. Traders in the immediate area benefited from the improved class in the area. Those who did not benefit from the scheme were the very poor who could afford only a minimal rent. \n  Area 2 Plunkett Street  \n This area of about two acres, was bounded by Hanover Lane on the south and Back Lane on the north and included all of Plunkett Street extending from Patrick Street to Francis Street. There were 161 dwelling houses in the area and their conditions had deteriorated considerably since Dr. Mapothers report in 1876, so much so that 28 had been compulsorily depopulated and were vacant in 1880. Most of the others were more or less unfit for habitation. They were positioned in narrow lanes without yards and therefore lacked suitable sanitary facilities. There was not one substantial dwelling house remaining in the area. The area was inhabited by 373 families. With the exception of some butchers the population consisted almost exclusively of the humblest class.

Granda Lennon died on Sept 18th at 2 o'clock in the morning, he was 90 in June. Thank God he didn't have to spend another winter on his own in Loughinisland. We had the funeral last Wed. from Barry <*> ampersand </*>    Maureen 's   home, everything went well.

Love Mum \n\n\n<$A>\n Dear Jane, It 's Sat. afternoon in Tony 's the rain is pouring down <*> ampersand </*> I can hardly see to write this as my glasses are in the house. How goes it. We got all your nice letters and cards for Christmas and your lovely present. We have changed the car to a Vauxhall    Cavalier   , it belonged to Ciaran Lennon, Louisa was going to buy it but it was going to cost her <*> pound sign </*> 1,000 to insure it so we gave Louisa the Fiesta for <*> pound sign </*> 300 it took <*> pound sign </*> 500 to insure it. We paid Ciaran <*> pound sign </*> 2,300 so we just went to the bank for another loan. You got a refund    of   <*> pound sign </*> 230 from the TAX man I just lodged it in our a/c until you get home. Richard visits us every THURS night for 1/2 hr as he has a bus run to Killyleagh every week, he    parks   the bus outside the house, someone told me I had a bus load of visitors one night <*> ampersand </*> when I looked out the window I nearly had a fit. Andrew is with us quite often now, his mum <*> ampersand </*> Dad have sold up in London <*> ampersand </*> has come to N.I. to live. Your holiday island looks like Donegal in the Sun. Cormac has a    girlfriend   called Anne-Marie Desmond from Crossgar, she called with us over Christmas. Louisa is doing well at Crossgar it 's a pity    it 's   not permanent. Louisa will be out of work in April and you will be home in    April   , lets hope some good jobs are on the horizon.

She talks about you all the time. We all miss you a lot. Louisa is due home next week. I tried to phone her    tonight   but she wasn't in so I have no news from her.

{"text": "<Family letters 2>\n\n\n<$A>\n 24.10.95 \n Dear Joan Your mother is trying to get everyone to send you a card for your birthday so as I am sitting here alone on a wet windy Tuesday morning I thought I would send you a few lines Summer is well and truly gone now    although   October has been the warmest on record. As you know Dad died on the 18th Sept aged 90. He just died of old age, knew he was going,    anyway   I am sure he is now setting about to organise heaven to his needs We all miss him very much as he was our main reason for going to Ballymartin. Now Ciaran has the place locked up when he is not at home. Your Mum has just arrived back with Margaret, she takes her Tues/Thur to play school in the hall Margaret tells me she was playing with the boys (starting early) and she fell    off   a tractor, she enjoys it a lot. Did you hear from anyone that Seamus was reported to the cops for underage drinking. Megan and himself and 2 others bought cider, drank it and one of the girls in the party went home drunk. Her parents reported it to the police. They are taking statements from all concerned and that will probably be the end of the matter. Margaret has just come back to me and said that when she fell    off   the tractor she hurt her  \"bake\"  explain that to your Thai students. John is still working away and he and his mates have booked themselves a holiday in Rhodes in May next. We met Glen and Mrs Watson in Downpatrick yesterday and they told us they were just back from Benidorm and thoroughly enjoyed it Glen is now keeping very well They said Bob is still working away but is thinking of changing to be a bus driver. We have just been watching the eclipse of the sun on T.V. news. Did you catch any alligators. Are we all getting alligator purses for xmas. I hear a lot of dogs went missing when they were at large. Amanda seems to be enjoying her stint teaching in St    Colmcille 's   she gets with Rita-Louise 'Wee    Ciaran 's   wife' and I pick her up in the evening. She tried to take the car the first morning but only succeeded in flooding the engine after starting it could not get it    restarted   so I had to jump out of bed and take her, however she has taken the car to Belfast a few times and seems to be coping well with the driving. Bridget did not come home for dad 's funeral but she was on the phone a few times with us She is now working    part-time   again and seems to be recovering slowly, lets hope and pray she does not have a relapse. Would it be possible for you to buy a THAI present for me to give to your mum at Christmas something pretty good and sensible. I will reimburse you on your return. If you can't afford it don't leave yourself short. You could   send   it to me c/o Adele. Your Mum has just told me to write on the back of each page to save on postage She never changes so I am doing it, anything for a quiet life. We are now well into our bowling season, are doing well and playing a lot of tournaments. I still go mushroom picking when they are available The money is not great but it gets me out of bed early when I am required. I see from your last letter that you are a bit homesick now and again. I am just sitting here wondering is it better to be working in a foreign country and be a bit homesick or sitting here on a miserable day like this with possibly no work, no money and sick of home. On the short term 1 year  I would always opt for the first option. How is your friend coping, does Christmas mean anything out there are there any turkeys in Thailand Will you teach the Thais to sing \"Auld Lang Syne\" for the New Year Have you come across any R.C. Churches. This is probably the longest letter I have ever written so you can feel a bit privileged. So I hope you are keeping well. We are always thinking of you hope the time passes quickly Keep smiling, all my love Dad \n\n\n<$A>\n 19/3/96 \n Dear Joan We are just back from the shop with your goodies. Terry rang and said she was flying out on Friday so we were wondering what you would like I hope all your teeth don't fall out. Adele and Martin are trying to make a go of it but they still have their ups and downs. Geoff and Amanda have been very supportive to them, taking them out for meals and such like Mum and myself are still hoping a separation will not take place. Enclosed you will find a photo of Seamus and Megan at the school formal (the suit cost a  fortune (wrong word) Noreen is 60 this week and we have been invited to a party for her on Sat. night however Seamus and myself are playing bowls in Coalisland Co. Tyrone this Sat. so we might not be home in time (lucky me) Your uncles Jimmy and Ciaran are 50 on Sun 24th but I have not heard of any parties yet. Sunday past was St Paddy 's day. If we have enclosed the Recorder you can read all about it. I had a letter from Sr. Bridget today She is very well now, asking about you and suggesting you drop in on her on your way home. We are still hoping peace will stay with us. I suppose you have heard of the terrible shooting in Scotland. 16 P.1s a teacher <*> plus sign </*> the lunatic who did it all died in a school gymnasium. Have you heard any rumblings of the conflict between China and Taiwan I hope it does not get too serious and come to conflict between the Yanks and China. Bob still calls every week for a 1/2 hour but we are usually on the way out to bowls when he arrives so he usually has the house to himself or Amanda entertains him. I believe he has bought a Vauxhall Nova I hope you are still enjoying your stay there. I passed on your message to Geoff about work and like the man digging a hole in the road he said he would look into it. I will sign    off   now as the dinner is ready and I have to mash the spuds Love Dad. \n\n\n<$A>\n 8/4/97 \n Dear Joan I am sitting here on a lovely afternoon minding Margaret, she is out in the garden, Mum and Sue have gone to Belfast for a few hours. Thank you very much for your birthday present. Can you ever see me wearing it, Sue is still making plans to visit you. She is trying to persuade Eveline to go as well. \n I think you heard about Seamus getting tipsy in Carryduff and stealing <*> pound sign </*> 15 from the house. He was interviewed in Castlereagh holding centre about it but I think the woman is not going to <unclear> 1 word </unclear> charges. On Friday night last the police picked him up at the cross in Killyleagh in a drunk and abusive state They brought him home about 12.30 he was going to beat all round him Even me. He had 7 tins of Miller in him. Eventually we got him settled down John slept on the floor of his room all night to keep an eye on him. I had to take him to the barracks at 12 noon on Sat, he got a right good    bollocking   , said he was sorry but could    remember   very little about it. For punishment the police told him to cut my lawn for the rest of the year and get a bit of    sense   . He is now more or less grounded. Your Mum was most upset but she will probably get over it in time Adele is still carrying on as before. We were all at the Church of Ireland for Belinda 's (   Jim 's   girl) christening yesterday, it was 1 1/2 hours long evening prayer service and was very nice. I hope you are enjoying your holiday, bring home plenty of photos. I signed a proxy form yesterday to allow me to vote for you in the general election. The girls at the mushrooms keep asking about you. Maybe you could sent them a card sometime. This is a long letter for me so I will now sign off. Keep well love Dad. \n\n\n<$A>\n 30/3/98 \n Dear Joan Thank you very much for your present It took me all of 1 Hr to get it together however I have had much pleasure watching others trying to do it We are all very well over here Your Mum and I are looking forward to our holiday starting 6th May.

Adele and Margaret seem to be managing all right at present. Adele has now got a brace on her teeth and is only eating mushy foods. Your Ma is just now up in the roof space sorting presents for the bowls dinner so I have to keep leaving this to hold steps, take down boxes and so forth so that 's my excuse for all this weird writing.

{"text": "<Thailand letters 1>\n\n\n<$A>\n 03/02/97 \n Hi Lynne - Well As promised \u00d0 A letter, although to tell you the truth not a lot has happened here over the past month I 'm getting a bit fed up with going out in Killyleagh so I think I 'll spend the next few weekends in Belfast with Kevin \u00d0 who is currently too sick to even sit at his desk at the minute. Apparently he has a slipped disc and is in complete agony. I went up to Belfast last weekend. Both of us were broke so we couldn't go out anywhere and Kevin has this  major  piece of work to be in for March so he was studying  all  the time \u00d0 I was bored out of my mind. \n I 'm trying to learn how to play the guitar. Flap is going to give both me and Lorcan lessons from next week onwards \u00d0 in exchange for driving lessons! \u00d0 in my car That will totally kill it. My Mum probably mentioned in her letter but Flap + Red won <*> pound sign </*> 2000 in the lottery \u00d0 5 numbers \u00d0 They are like    celebrities   in Killyleagh now <*> plus sign </*> needless to say everyone 's looking a loan from them. \n Jennifer has just recently been asking, \"   Where 's   Lynnie?\"  A whole month and she 's only realising now! \n - Dermot was working in Smugglers last weekend and at the end of the night he found a lottery ticket \u00d0 He checked the numbers the next day \u00d0 4 numbers \u00d0 the lucky git won <*> pound sign </*> 128 \u00d0 He didn't tell mum so  don't  mention it in any of your letters. \n I haven't seen Del or Paul since you left but Kevin said they were both at the Union on New    Year 's   eve \u00d0 totally off their heads. \n Your house looked very nice <*> plus sign </*> big \u00d0 which it will need to be if everybody comes out that says they 're going to! I 'll probably book my ticket at Easter.    Kevin 's   not sure how long he can stay for but I hope to stay for at least 6 weeks \u00d0 Write to Kevin \u00d0 he 's pissed off that you haven't replied to his letter yet \u00d0 I 'll write again when something interesting happens \u00d0 if it does! \n -See you soon Love Vanessa PS I passed my exams \u00d0 \n - I didn't realise there was room on this side \u00d0 It seems such a waste so I 'll try to think of something else to write. \n Sorry \u00d0 can't think of anything! Bye \n\n\n<$A>\n 12/04/97 \n Hi Lynne, Well, after talking to you this morning I eventually persuaded Jessica to come to Thailand with me. We went into Downpatrick and booked ourselves onto the cheapest flight possible - <*> pound sign </*> 547 return \u00d0 flying with B.A. we are flying out on the 19th June \u00d0 Jessica is staying for 3 weeks \u00d0 going back on the 8th July \u00d0 I 'm staying slightly longer \u00d0 7 weeks going back on 6th August. Jessica hasn't even booked her time off yet so she 's shitting herself in case her boss says that she can't have those particular weeks off. \n I told her that you were in Cambodia and she said that was something she would really like to do. I know you won't be able to get a lot of time    off   when we arrive but basically Jessica wants to travel round Thailand for about a week, spend a week relaxing \u00d0 beach, snorkelling, watersports etc and maybe a week in Cambodia/Vietnam. We both need a visa as we 're staying for longer than 14 days so write back <*> plus sign </*> tell us exactly where to get it from. Also if you want anything brought out I should be able to manage it as long as    it 's   not too big. \u00d0 I 'm hoping to bring very little with me as I can wear your clothes and therefore have loads of room to bring stuff back with me. The flight money has just about cleaned me out \u00d0 I hope to bring loads of spending money but God knows where I 'm going to get it from! \n Kevin probably won't be able to afford Thailand as he has spent quite a lot of his own money getting to Nepal. He 's away for two weeks to the international SCI Conference \u00d0 it only lasts 5 days so he should have plenty of time to go up Mount Everest <*> plus sign </*> back. \u00d0 No doubt he 'll do it in record time! \u00d0 I think my dad wrote to you last week so he probably told you all about Dermot and his  4  encounters with the police over the past few months \u00d0 3 for underage drinking <*> plus sign </*> one for  theft!  \u00d0 I 'll explain it all to you when I get out there. \n I 've just been round at    Edel 's   for a few hours \u00d0 both of us sitting in her garden, drinking beer, playing the guitar <*> ampersand </*> watching Tony work. He 's doing up the garden \u00d0 laying concrete slabs, planting flowers etc. He 's actually quite nice once you get to know him. \u00d0 Well, I think I 'd better go inside now before I get burnt to a cinder \u00d0    It 's   quite hot here today although if you were here you 'd probably be sitting with a jumper on. \u00d0 Write back and fill us in on all the details of what we should bring out with us etc. \u00d0 We are expecting you to meet us at the airport by the way \u00d0 I can't really imagine me and Jessica finding our way round Bangkok by ourselves \n See you soon Love Vanessa. \n\n\n<$B>\n 29 Ardmore Drive Belfast (Ages ago\u00c9) \n <&Thai> Sa wa dee ka </&Thai>  Lynnie!!\nHow 's things? I realise you 're probably not in Khorat to get this as    you 're   probably off in Vietnam or something cosmic like that!! It 's a pity    it 's   so expensive to phone. Anyway, the job sounds great. I haven't got your letter yet \u00d0 I hope it comes soon as I 'm dying to hear more about it. Do you honestly think I 'd be able to do it?? I 'm a bit worried about going out <*> ampersand </*> not being able to do it or whatever. My parents are willing to lend me the cash to get out there (again!!) I 'm still in the Fair Trade shop (month 9 \u00d0 can U believe it!?) How long is this job in Thailand for? Are you leaving T'land to go to Coleraine in September?? Or are U you gonna going to stay on a bit? I 'm a bit worried about being in Khorat on my    tod   \u00d0 although I 'd probably be settled enough by the time you left. It 's just that I can only speak about 3 fucking words of Thai!! \n Anyway, your letter was great \u00d0 sounds like a totally  mad  time!! Your 46 year old drinking partner sounds like a serious character all right.    Carol 's   still in Hungary. She didn't enjoy it at all at first but she seems to be getting into it all right now. This won't get to you in time probably but \u00c9 \n !! HAPPY ST. PADDY'S DAY!! I hope you get totally pissed wherever you were! \n Life here is just O.K. The weather is picking up a bit, job isn't as bad as it was, I 'm still totally fucking skint all the time <*> ampersand </*> I 've basically been getting plastered loads <*> ampersand </*> being very silly indeed. I 've been going out with this guy Larry for about 5 or 6 months now (sort of) <*> ampersand </*> he 's great crack, dead sweet, sensitive <*> ampersand </*> intelligent \u00c9. and he doesn't like penetrative sex!! What!?! I know \u00d0 does my    fucking   head in. I reckon maybe he 's a closet gay \u00d0 only joking. So I 've been a bit sexually frustrated \u00d0 I quite fancy the idea of being a lesbian instead \u00d0 or bi anyway \u00d0 Whaddya reckon babe!? My mate Ellen has sort of got a thing going with a really sexy girl we met in the Parliament (my favourite haunt these days) \u00d0    it 's   all rather hilarious \u00d0 she 's been running about like a horny 16 year old virgin! \n Anyway, I have, as usual, been basically getting shitfaced till that bastard phenomenon reality is but a mere speck on the horizon, grinding my teeth through the daily chores of being assistant manager of this dear shop <*> ampersand </*> biding my time to do the RSA Tefl in Queen 's in July. Yes, every year up till this one it was <*> pound sign </*> 360 or something. This year    it 's   <*> pound sign </*> 725. If I stuck this job till the end of my contract (end of June) I 'd get <*> pound sign </*> 250 towards it <*> ampersand </*> I 've also got <*> pound sign </*> 250 from the trust funds so it 's still a possible option. At least then I 'd have a bit of confidence when I went wherever to teach. But really, I can't be arsed with being so skint etc for another 3 1/2 months <*> ampersand </*> then U told me about the job <*> ampersand </*> it sounds great <*> ampersand </*> I guess I can always do the Tefl another time etc etc etc. God to think I could be out there with you dead soon \u00d0 mad! I need to know more about the job first though I think. For once in my life I 'm trying to think what 'll be best career wise etc. Lots of people keep telling me to stick at this job <*> ampersand </*> do the good tefl blah blah blah. I don't think I want to. This job sounds too good to be true \u00d0 although I realise    it 's   not    definite   yet or anything. Whaaa! I wanna go diving <*> ampersand </*> I wanna go to Vietnam, or maybe Australia or who knows!! What 's your plans?? Fancy a bit a Cambodia, eh what? All that  \"war torn society\"  business \u00c9 Talking of which, there 's soldiers all over the show here \u00d0 everywhere ya fuckin' look! Does my face in big time!!! \n Well, I 've decided I 'm gonna go <*> ampersand </*> ask Gene Your Nessa 's boyfriend  for his advice about what I should do \u00c9  - he 's always so sensible & 'global' thinking. I 'm in a bit of a rut, but it 's a very cosy, comfortable rut <*> ampersand </*> my usual hard-nosed  \"I can go anywhere <*> ampersand </*> do anything\"  attitude is rather fuzzy. He 'll probably give me a couple of good answers to all these little queries. Lordy knows I need 'em!! I have to decide  real  soon as the cheaper shitty tefl is at the end of March. EEK! There 's an even    shittier   cheaper one in Stranmillis \u00d0 finishes on 18th April \u00d0 which is rather late to being going out to T'land  . I mean I could do with a couple of weeks to chill, get used to culture, heat <*> ampersand </*> other chaos that place is!!! \n I know I probably would be wasting time <*> ampersand </*> <*> pound sign </*> doing the cheap    shitty   ones, but I don't think I could go all the way to T'land  to teach with absolutely nothing! I 'd be keeking myself the whole time. \n Whaddya think? Sorry this letter is such a ramble, but this is me trying to be sensible!!! \n Did you get yourself a motorbike? We 'd have to get one between us if not.  And  (just a wee thought) \u00d0 I don't know if you 're paying rent or not, but if I got this job <*> ampersand </*> came over, as you said    yourself   , I could get a mansion for <*> pound sign </*> 200 a month \u00d0 with air-con <*> ampersand </*> a shower etc \u00d0 we could both live in it <*> ampersand </*> then U wouldn't have to spend money on rent. Besides it would be excellent to share a place \u00d0 I 'd much rather! What larks would be had!! Whaddya think? \n Have you seen Aat yet? I kind of hope not for your sake, though it sounds like yer well over that anyway!!! \n Well me dear, I 'll love ya <*> ampersand </*> leave ya <*> ampersand </*> hopefully see you soon. By the way, I don't know if U sent a fax but it didn't arrive if U did. The number is 01447 674528 \u00d0 could be that our fax machine is a load of wank. Stay in touch ASAP \u00d0 I look forward to getting your letter \u00d0 \n Lots of love  ginger beer <*> ampersand </*> good ol' Irish    whiskey   , \n Elaine XOXOXO P.S. Please try <*> ampersand </*> let me know A.S.A.P what the job entails!

{"text": "<Thailand letters 2>\n\n\n<$A>\n 18.4.97 \n Hi Lynne, How 's things? I got your letter about a month ago - I 'm sorry I didn't write sooner but you know what am I like when it comes to writing letters. Well, I 'm glad to hear that you are keeping well and having lots of fun with your new Thai friends. I 'll be wanting your autograph next ha ha. I 'm sure they think you are super star on the radio. I hope you didn't mention the incident where a middle-aged woman stripped off her clothing in a \"public bar\" - maybe that 's not such a big deal in Thailand. \n Well things are ticking away here nicely. It 's only five months to the \"big\" day so I 'm trying to get organised as much as possible. I have bought my dress and I 'm getting Terry 's made. \n Also Luke and I have bought a house in Crossgar -    it 's   just past Crossgar High School and on the opposite side of road -    it 's   called \"53 Oakland Drive\". You may recognise  where it is if you look at the picture. It is a 2 storied semi detached -    it 's   really nice but the decor is awful but we can change that through time. We only got it a few days ago so you can imagine the novelty hasn't    worn   off yet! I have Luke tortured trying to get it cleaned. I wish you were here to enjoy the crack. \n I 'm not sure whether Allanah told you but did you know that Ger and Mary Beth are coming to live in Ireland for good. They told Luke and I at Christmas but we were not allowed to break the news until February past. They came home for a few days in February because they had job interviews They don't have definite jobs yet but I don't think they will have any problems as they are well educated and have a lot work experience. They come home on 12 May and are staying in Ger 's mum 's house for a while. They may well rent our house for a while until they get something of their own. This will be good for us as it will help to pay our mortgage until we get married. So I 'm afraid you 're going to miss a big house warming and welcome home party - I 'll be thinking about you. \n I haven't seen Allanah in a while because we haven't been down at the Dufferin. Since we knew our offer was accepted on the house we 've had to save quite a lot of money - so unfortunately we 've had to cut down on our socialising. It 's a pity because we had some good crack down in the Dufferin. \n I have started the aerobics in the Dufferin -    it 's   on twice a week and    Betty   is really good - you would enjoy it - although I haven't managed to persuade Allanah to go yet. I can really notice my    thighs   and bum toning up although you have to work at it. Do you do any form of exercise apart from drinking glasses of whiskey ha ha? \n So you haven't met anyone special yet! I 'm sure you have had a few one night stands staying over night in that big house of yours or are you missing Fizz too much - remember he did win the lottery! \n Oh by the way did you know that Margaret had a wee girl called Eithne the day after you left. She is really beautiful and is the picture of Cormac. Mairead 's baby is due on 5 June so that will be something else to look forward to. \n It 's pity you 're not going to be here when Ger and Mary Beth come home as I think it will be really good crack but I suppose it will be no time until you are home yourself for good. \n Well, I have to go now and get my stuff ready for work in the morning. Luke, Mum, Dad, Terry <*> ampersand </*> Eamon all say hello and said you 've not to be too hard on those students of yours! \n Take care, Write soon Love Paula XXXX P.S I hope you enjoyed your holidays. \n\n\n<$B>\n Yo there Lynnie!! How the fuck are ya girl!?! Well I got your letter - 'tis great!! And I 've been speaking to Eileen who gave me your message that the job starts on May 1st! EEEK!!! \n Well, when I got the letter I was jumping about all set to go - but since then I 've been in an utter muddle...and I still am. And because I 'm in an utter muddle, I still haven't got it together to send my CV!!! EEEK. Promise I 'll do it this week. I have to write one first!! \n Basically, I 'm in a muddle because I can't decide to go or not. The reason for this  is  I really want to do the good tefl in July. It 's expensive but I could go to Holland for May <*> ampersand </*> June to make some cash, keep paying rent on me room so I 'd have it to come back to in July so I 'd be in my own settled wee pad to study like fuck for 5 weeks. I know this job doesn't entail doing a tefl - but I guess that 's the problem. It all sounds great - especially being there with you - but I don't know where this job will get me. My plan since I came home was to get a good decent qualification <*> ampersand </*> go and teach for a year <*> ampersand </*> hopefully then like you,    Esther   , Ron, Sally-Anne <*> ampersand </*> so many of my friends I would finally know what the fuck I was doing. I 've been feeling    freaked   about myself, my life, my career for 2 years now - basically since I graduated. Maybe I am too young to get so    freaked   about it, but believe me when yer in my situation looking at all your friends,    it 's   like  \"Oh my God - where did I go wrong?\"  The one thing I 've had playing in my mind that 's been constant through all my other ideas is Tefl. I don't know if I 'll enjoy or even if I can do, but I think <*> ampersand </*> hope I will <*> ampersand </*> can. \n And this job isn't teaching. And that 's the main reason why I 've reservations. I guess I just don't know enough about what the actual job entails. It sounds easy enough, the money is <(> fan-fucking-tastic </(> (<*> ampersand </*> I 've  never  had money so U you can imagine the temptation the job is to me) but my main fear is going over, finding myself in a job that sounds more like a glorified librarian than a teacher <*> ampersand </*> sitting for a year still thinking  \"where am I going\"  <*> ampersand </*>  \"what am I doing\"  etc. If it was  teaching  in that school I 'd be over like a shot, but I 'm so scared of feeling I 'm not progressing in what I want to do - or  think  I want to do. \n I mean, if I went out to Khorat <*> ampersand </*> could teach for a year, I could come home with you and we could both live together <*> ampersand </*> do the masters at Coleraine  OR  I could do a PGCE in primary school teaching which would leave me able to have a skill and I could sub my way through my masters in 'Anthropology  Film' in Manchester which I rather fancy in a couple of years. \n Do you know what I mean?? I 'm gonna try to do the cheap, shitty tefl in case I come out in April to do the job if I get it - leave no doors closed eh? I wish I could have a seriously long chat with you as I need to know more about the job <*> ampersand </*> what it could lead to. \n    Anyway   , I hope you know despite all this I 'm still considering it seriously - in fact I haven't stopped thinking about it for 2 seconds since you phoned - need some advice - QUICKLY!! \n I just don't know what 's the best thing to do. I mean if I stay <*> ampersand </*> do the good RSA tefl in July, I would still come to Khorat in August for a year - no probs - if I could get a job. You would know better than me what the chances of that are. If maybe you could put my CV in a few places saying I have the RSA tefl AND all the rest of the stuff (I.V.S etc) <*> ampersand </*> I would be available from mid August or whatever, something might turn up. I 'm gonna try to phone U tomorrow - but yer probably still away. \n What do you think?? What 's the chances of me getting a job that good in August instead of May? Could you put my CV about? Do you know more about the job? Could I get experience teaching? What do you mean by  \"developing materials?\"  How long is it for? Do U think it could lead to other things ie good tefl jobs? What should I do? EEK - I need to make up my mind really really soon. \n Sorry this letter is such a big serious rant, but I really want to be sure I make the right decision. I need the address of the school. Will I fax my CV to your work? Are the Thais really OK in Khorat? My nasty little experiences with Thai men still play in my mind. I try not to let it effect my thoughts of going. - All that shit was on the islands - which as U say is another world.    Esther   will be home soon so I can talk to her. Fuck, what a fuckin' amazin' opportunity <*> ampersand </*> I can't think of anyone I 'd rather be in Thailand <*> ampersand </*> hopefully travel with than you <*> ampersand </*> yet I 'm hesitating? WHY? Maybe I 've just got settled in a Belfast rut <*> ampersand </*> am too scared  OR  maybe I really need to do that tefl for myself <*> ampersand </*> my own confidence. Can I do an RSA tefl anywhere in Khorat? Maybe that would be the answer. I know it 's possible to do it in Bangkok  BUT  time off work <*> ampersand </*> where would I live etc. \n OOh er missus - what a tizzy I 'm in!!!! \n I mean to say - what am I so scared    of   ? What am I fucking like?    Anyway   me lovely, sorry again this letter is so crappy - if you can PLEASE give me a phone. I need your advice. What would U do?? I 'll get the CV over soon. Maybe I should just wise up, take the bull by the horns <*> ampersand </*> get me arse over 4 some fun <*> ampersand </*> frolicks. The job I 've been in for 9 months has done my head in, <*> ampersand </*> my confidence <*> ampersand </*> self-esteem as far as \"work\" goes has been seriously knocked. It 's been O.K. though cause I 've loved living in this house <*> ampersand </*> I 've lots of good friends here etc so all has not been lost. I 'm scared of feeling that crap in a job again - especially in a foreign country. Where have my balls gone? I promise I 'll be out in August if I can get a job if I don't come next month. EEK!! \n    Anyway   , I hope you had a total ball in Vietnam <*> ampersand </*> if I come over (no - WHEN) U have to go diving again with me! And we have to get a motorbike!!! I hear Eileen <*> ampersand </*> maybe Fred as well will be out in the summer - EXCELLENT!! Any skank yet? I split up with Jimmy for good last Saturday - fuck him - he 's frigid and has made me feel unsexy for a long time - so it 's back on the    singles'  </}/ market 4 for me - probably just as well really - I don't need that shit!! I just keep telling myself I 'm a sexy bitch <*> ampersand </*> he 's an immature frigid shit. I may as well. I 'll be damned if I let him make me feel shitty about myself. Men!! I really give up.    Janet 's   very happy with her woman!! Maybe she 's got the right feckin' idea eh what! \n Well, I 'll love ya <*> ampersand </*> leave ya - please please contact me soon with all the  you can. I 'll hopefully see U in April <*> ampersand </*> if not in August!! \n Lots <*> ampersand </*> lots of sex, drugs <*> ampersand </*> <(> fanfeckintastic </(> vibes,    whiskey   , stout, gin  spicyness, Paulette XOXOXOX", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "fe873e66-8dee-4ee3-8722-a32adff5a558", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.537409+00:00"}
{"text": "<Mum's letters>\n\n\n<$A>\n Midnight 22.9.94 \n Dearest Ciara I just wanted to continue the conversation we were having on the phone about an hour ago - so I thought I 'd write you a little note before I go to bed. \n I 'm so glad that things seem to be going well for you and that your accommodation is comfortable. \n You must write and tell me all about the people in your house so that I can have a mental picture of them. \n I haven't much 'news' for you. Sally rang on Saturday last to heard how you 'd got on and how the journey went. She was really concerned about you. Carla also called for your address. The were both in Dublin for the 'All Ireland' weekend and stayed in Bob Atterberry 's new house. They said they had a really good time. \n Tonight I enrolled at Jordanstown to do the course I applied for i.e. Post. Grad. Cert. In Educ. Management. I don't know if I 'm mad - but I fell I should try it at least. It involves me going every Tues. - 4.15-8.15 p.m. so I won't be home until around 9 p.m. starting 4th Oct. \n I 'm really looking forward to seeing Sarah-Jane again - the house is so quiet with both of you gone! \n I think Jacinta misses the two of you being here - she has been in bed at 10 o'clock the last two nights! \n Ciara - don't worry about having to cook for your house-mates. Just follow the recipe and keep it simple - nothing elaborate to begin with. Don't let anything worry or annoy you during this year. Grab every opportunity that comes your way - and make lots of new friends. Make it a year to remember! \n I will try to get the phone-card fixed up soon - but I think it takes a while, so it could be a few weeks. \n In the meantime - don't worry about phoning all the time. Once a week is plenty - say perhaps around teatime on Sat. or Sun. - unless of course you need something or want to talk to me about something in particular. You can't afford to be wasting a lot of money on phone-calls. \n Don't forget to feed yourself well and manage your bank account wisely. Don't try to economise on things you need. Plan your food so that you eat a balanced diet - and buy whatever books are necessary for your studies. \n When you come home at Christmas, I 'll get you a rucksack so that the same problems don't arise when you 're travelling again as did last Friday. It must have been awful for you. Just as well I didn't know until after the event!! \n Well that 's about it for tonight. It 's now 1 A.M. and I 'm going to bed. Daddy and Phil send their love. \n Write to me sometime and fill me in on all the details. Look after yourself and stay happy! \n Goodnight <*> ampersand </*> God bless - All my love Mummy xxx P.T.O. \n P.S. Glad to hear you 'll get a tinkle on the old ivories. Wasn't it a coincidence that somebody with a keyboard is sharing your house? Don't forget to say your prayers every night - Mum xxx \n\n\n<$A>\n \"Home Sweet Home\" 11.10.94 \n Dear Ciara, It is now 12.45 A.M. - and as usual I 'm doing the jobs which I should have done earlier in the evening - except that this time I have an excuse! - i.e. Ronan McAlpine called and we were having a chat and a little drink. Then J.P. came in around 10 p.m. - having had her dinner cooked for her by Fred Keane and I heard the events of yesterday., i.e. Ted and she have parted company - but I 'll leave the details of that for her to relate. Suffice to say that she is feeling sad tonight - but she 's a survivor and in time she 'll be joyful again. \n I have just completed the 2nd week of my P.G. course in Educ. Management. It's v. boring, not at all what I expected - all group discussion which can be boring for 4 hours after teaching all day. However I 've committed myself to it and must continue. \n I don't get home until 9 p.m. on Tues. evening and have 2 assignments via \"Action Research\" to do for Christmas. An integral part of 'Action Research' is keeping a diary/journal - it must be in a way like the one you kept last year. The idea is to identify a management issue, analyse and improve it by introspectively looking at your actions regarding this issue. Hence the need for a diary. I 've a very good article about keeping a research diary which might have been of use to you - and still might be for future study. \n Jacinta 's parents ' night was last Monday - and I was very happy with what I heard. Everyone had v. good things to say about her. She seems to be working - but Ger was not happy with her scales last night!!! \n J-P was playing with Bill Harrington and Janet Ramsay on Sat. night. Bill rang and    asked   her to play with them, for which she got <*> pound sign </*> 60! Ashley Fisher also rang for her tonight - but she wasn't in. She doesn't seem very keen though. \n Life is pretty busy as usual - but nothing very rivetting to report. A. Gilly is in Lourdes this week, so I hope she has a really good time. Jacinta is going in for Sunday practices for \"My Fair Lady\". She 's in the 'Ascot Chorus' and was also picked for the 'Embassy Ball' - so that means she gets two gowns!! \n I think she 's enjoying it all very much. Last week I gave in to letting her go to a preformal - but unfortunately for her, it was cancelled. Adam has never phoned her since the letter - but maybe that 's just as well from her point of view. \n Your letter (which by the way I received this morning) sounded v. bright and cheerful, which made me very happy. I 'm so glad that things are going so well for you Ciara. Louvain seems like an excellent choice for a student. Keep up the cooking and maybe you 'll even cook our Christmas dinner this year!! I think Louvain will teach you more than just French during this year. \n Keep up your violin playing and I 'm so delighted you joined the orchestra. All of that will open pathways to new friendships. \n Daddy sends his love and hopes the French is improving. I 'm tired now Ciara - so I 'll call it a day. Goodnight and God bless. Love always - Mum xxxx \n P.S. Glad to hear you visited Bruges last week. \n P.P.S. Maybe you 'll drop Lucille a little letter sometime - she 'd love that. \n\n\n<$A>\n Dear Ciara, As usual - it 's 1 A.M. and I 'm thinking of you. I hope that you 're tucked up in your bed and fast asleep. I 've just been at my course - and as usual am asking myself why I ever bothered to do this. \n There 's a lot of work ahead of me - and I really have no inclination to do it. \n Sarah-Jane was at lunch today with Sammy - but no doubt she 'll fill you in on all the details, so I 'll leave that to her. Jacinta is working hard at the minute, what with increased homework and practices for 'My Fair Lady' in which she is taking part in the 'Cockney Chorus', 'The Embassy Ball' and - I forget the other one. \n Ger is pushing her to learn her Grade 7 scales. The exam will be in a few weeks - and I 'm afraid her scales are not up to the mark. \n The clocks went back as you know on Sat. night - so winter has really set in. The nights are long and it 's getting quite cold. \n Aunt Gilly had a great time in Lourdes. Weather/hotel and everything was beautiful. I 'm very glad for her that she enjoyed her little 'break.' - (I 've just remembered the other chorus that Jacinta 's in - 'The Ascot Chorus') \n P.T.O. \n Ciara - this is a very impromptu letter - more or less just to tell you we 're all thinking of you and missing you - so forgive the lack of continuity in it. I don't really have any news for you that I haven't already told you on the phone, except that Miss McInerney announced last week that she 's retiring at Christmas - so that means a new principal. I don't really relish the thought of yet another new person at the top - but I suppose I 'll have to grin and bear it! - New people in key positions inevitably bring about change - and at the minute it 's the last thing I want. \n This weekend we 're off (so is Daddy and Phil) Monday and Tuesday for Hallowe'en, so I 'm looking forward to the break. It won't be long until Christmas and you 'll be home. I 'm looking forward to that! Daddy, myself and the McDermots are going to the Dowling 's on Sat. night. \n I 'm going to wind up now Ciara - as I have the lunches still to make. Belfast is a very peaceful place at the moment, thank God - there are going to be less soldiers and the streets and police are taking off their flack-jackets - so things appear optimistic at last. \n Lots of Love always Mum <*> ampersand </*> Dad <*> ampersand </*> Phil <*> ampersand </*> J-P. \n\n\n<$A>\n Your home 11 pm 23.11.94 \n Dear Ciara, Having received your 'humourous' card this morning - I thought I 'd better write and keep you up to date with all the goings on. The Southern/Reynolds situation would need some space to explain - so I 'll leave it to your more politically minded friends to do so in a more succinct manner than I possibly could. \n <&French> &\\A ce moment </&French> , dad is in the sitting-room watching a match, Jacinta is upstairs playing her violin (practising for the Grade 7 which is on Dec. 6th ) and I am about to go out for a walk with Maude. So I 'll continue this epistle on my return, as she has just arrived (alongside Jonathan). That put an end to J-P 's study-night. \n I 've just returned from a walk during which I 've observed and felt the first frost of winter. The weather has been  very  mild of late. Jacinta has just spent half of the night on the 'phone - a boy who partnered her in the 'Embassy Ball' scene phoned her, since he hasn't and I quote  'seen much of her or talked to her since the performance!' - which by the way was marvellous.  \n Adam came over on Sat. night to  'return a book'  which Lucille borrowed from us. So, the admirers are still all there. Joe is another one from St. Mals. who phones in the hope she 'll go to the cinema with him - but that of course is out of the question for some time to come!!! \n J-P - despite her moaning to you is having a ball. Last night she was at a 'Law do' in the Regency and went partying afterwards - (a bit like yourself at the moment from what I 'm hearing!) So don't believe all this deep depression over Ted. I think she 's fairly well over him now - At least I hope so! \n For my part - I 'm continuing my course - Goodness knows why, as I think my studying days are over. However last week, I had a bit of work to hand up - and I was the star, as I was asked to read mine out the following week! I was quite chuffed about that. I don't get home on Tues. until 9 p.m. - so it 's a long day. \n Well the big news is, St Teresa 's Boys ' and Girls ' are amalgamating, next Sept. Miss McInerney is retiring in June and Mr. Mason will be the principal of the amalgamated school. \n I think that 's all the news Ciara. Please send Uncle Ciaran/Ronan and Oisin a card if you haven't done so - or another one if it 's sometime since you have. Fr. Martin might appreciate one too, but I'm not sure of his address. \n Rachel was here on Sunday two weeks ago for her dinner. She 's in good form. I haven't seen much of the others recently - but I suppose everybody is working hard these days. Joseph Cashman has agreed to take J.P. as an apprentice and she is going to accept that. \n Yes, Amy is still playing the organ - but reluctantly. However, the new church is opening on 18th Dec. - after which there 'll be no more Sun night masses - so she 'll only have to do it for three more weeks. \n It 's now 1.50 A.M. Ciara - so I 'm going to retire now. Can't wait until I see you again as we miss you a lot. Still it won't be long now. Dad sends his love.

{"text": "<Medical student>\n\n\n<$A>\n 17 Florentine Way , Belfast. 29  th  October \n <&French> Ma cherie Roisin, Ca va? Merci beaucoup pour ta carte postale. </&French> There you are; another snippet from my extensive French repertoire. Hopefully it makes a bit more sense than my usual drunken Snackbar babblings, even though it 's probably not grammatically correct. But what can you expect from a mere medical student? \n Indeed my English is likely to be a little dodgy as I have only yesterday returned to civilisation after a 3-week sojourn to Derry. This was for the express purpose of looking into    people 's   ears, up their noses and down their throats. The    cognoscenti   call it otorhinolaryngology, but most people can understand it as Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT.) As for our prowess at the subject, we certainly managed to get up a few    people 's   noses, but unfortunately failed miserably to get down their throats (at the discos, you understand!) \n Alas it is now 16 days since I last was drunk \u00d0 the longest period since you left. Only Alex and myself are big drinkers amongst the crowd banished to Derry, so there 's not much drinking done there. Even back in Belfast last weekend I was sober since I was racing on Satruday. I actually went to Mulhouse completely sober\u00c9and enjoyed it. It 's amazing just how much more gossip you remember without the company of Mr. Guinness. \n Prior to that sobering experience I had really been doing some serious drinking. Three-legged pub crawl, Mystery tour, etc \u00d0 all  MUST  events. We staged the customary trick played by 4th years on the 1st years on their 1st day. 2 of the lads dressed up as \"Doctors\" and were introduced as such by a suitably bribed lecturer. They asked alternate questions to 1st years and a few 4th year plants scattered throughout the lecture theatre. Innocent little me was asked to come up to the front and demonstrate some of the movements of the shoulder joint. All according to our hastily arranged script, except no-one told me that to do so properly required me to remove my tee-shirt and stand beetroot \u00d0 faced in front of a packed lecture theatre, including about 1/2 of our year who had crammed into the back to watch the crack. Still, all in a bit of crack. Since then some of the 1st years have approached me and complimented me on my acting ability; however none of the girls have yet offered me sex having viewed my broad sinews. \n We are settling in nicely into 17. The house has survived    its   first christening party. The phone, however, did not    fare   as well \u00d0 Anthony managed to miss everyone with a basin full of water \u00d0 except the phone. It sounded distinctly sick for a few weeks thereafter and we diagnosed the condition as terminal and invested in a payphone. \n Andrew seems to be coping admirably as the lone non-medic. Well at least technically speaking he isn't, as Gregory is a science student this year \u00d0 he 's doing an intercalated BSc. Sad to say, we are missing the benefits of the girls\u00c9NOT!! No more strange grunting noises from the front room brothel; no more of Jane 's strange friend; able to watch the soccer on a Wednesday night in peace. Allegedly Yasmin is still operating from nearby Florentine Street, but as yet I haven't had the misfortune of bumping into her petite body. \n I 'm just considering my costume for the fancy dress, next week. It can be as ridiculous as ever, but it must fulfil 3 characteristics: 1.) Cheap; 2.) Easy and not too time consuming to assemble; 3.) Not constricting on the night \u00d0 I decided that the only possible reason for me not getting a tackle last year was that my face was painted green! \n So how 's it going yourself. I 'm glad to hear that you seem to be settling in well and are meeting loads of new people \u00d0 make sure you don't get too comfortable over there, so that you don't come back to us. Have you found a suitable Guinness drinker to    discreetly   sip away at his pints. I 've noticed I get more Guinness in my pints these days! \n Do drop us a note if you get a free minute away from all the partying (and studying???) Looking forward to seeing ye at Christmas. \n Best of Luck and Loads of Love, Kevin. \n\n\n<$A>\n 16B Newtown Rd. Antrim. 31st January. \n <&French> Ma ch&/ere Roisin, </&French> Sorry that this is going to arrive late. I intended to write last night, but got drunk instead. I 'm sure you 'll understand. \n How 's it going? It seems like only last Friday that I was talking to you in the Mandela. I hope the exams went well, <&French> comme toujours </&French>! Have you been taking swimming lessons recently\u00c9or making sandbags, umbrellas. I hear there 's a good profit to be made in such goods in your part of the world. Ha! Ha! \n Things here have been fairly quiet. The main reason for this is not a radical fitness drive, nor lack of money, but that I 'm living back home in happening, party-on-down Antrim. The reason for this in turn is that I 'm working with the nutters in the local madhouse. In particular, I 'm assigned to the 'really fucked up ward.' Here I have the pleasure of being locked in with convicts, psychos, druggies and some plain    weirdos   and discussing with them their philosophies in life, why God chose them to rule the world and their psychosexual history. I feel quite at home really. \n It does have its lighter moments. I brought a chronic alcoholic into the interview room and asked him what his major complaint was. He replied that a former schoolmate was coming into the ward each night and cutting a bit of his penis off and that his penis was now this big (placing his thumb and finger a couple of centimetres apart), and what would he do it he chopped it off altogether. Just how to you answer that question or try to console the poor bastard. The worst thing was that his chronic drinking had damaged his brain, so that he couldn't form new memory and hence he kept on forgetting that he had told me this story, so he kept on repeating it, looking for a sensible answer each time. See what alcohol can do to you! \n The next big event on the social calendar is the faculty ball on Fri 3rd (not the only big event that day!) As usual I 'm being accompanied by Mr. Guinness \u00d0 he may be dear (dear at heart), but at least he doesn't require a ticket ( <*> pound sign </*> 22). Guess who they put in charge of pouring the champagne at the reception. I probably won't remember the rest of the night, but I hope at least that I don't forget telling some medical student in the future that my penis is being chopped off! \n Unfortunately my running is at a standstill, so to speak. I went down to Dublin to see the Irish team doctor with a slight stiffness in the right knee and he injected it with cortisone (a nasty steroid, but don't tell anyone.) By the time I got back to Belfast, the local anaesthetic was beginning to wear off. <> #> By the next morning I couldn't walk because of the pain. That 's bloody doctors for you \u00d0 don't trust any of them \u00d0 especially if you know them! By the way, Eddie Condon was on TV last weekend, running in his first GB Senior international. \n Everyone else here is fine. At least I think they are, since I haven't seen them for a couple of weeks (probably not since you have!) \n I must go now to finish writing up my case history of a manic-depressive. So have a great (or should that be past tense) birthday and take care not to get into any mischief. \n Loads of love, Kevin. \n P.S. I just have realised that this is going to be even later than anticipated \u00d0 your address is in Florentine. \n\n\n<$A>\n 17 Florentine Way, 8th June 1995. \n Dear Roisin, How 's it going? Just a quick letter to say  'hello'  before I pop off to Australia for the summer. I have been meaning to write for some time (bought the Air Mail stamp some time ago indeed), but as usual I have left it to the last minute (I head early on 11th June and have still 2 cases and an essay to write for Friday, a party to go to on Friday night and all my shopping and packing to do!) \n Things had been relatively quiet until recently. I must have seen you last towards the end of April. Since then I have tried to limit my drinking to one night a week,    albeit   one very big night a week.\n The first weekend in April, our 'section' of the class headed on our first trip to Sellafield (that lovely safe, clean nuclear power station on the other side of the Irish Sea, which has nothing to do at all with leukaemia in children in Co. Down!!) As you can see, they have managed to bullshit and bribe us well \u00d0 who knows what a few free Guinness and a free meal can do!! We even got to stand on top of a nuclear reactor, and I didn't even get a tan. On the way back from Sellafield, 4 of us jumped off the bus and headed to Glasgow to meet up with another bunch of medics who were meeting up with some Glasgow medics. A nasty weekend indeed \u00d0 to the tune of <*> pound sign </*> 125. But well worth the lack of memories!!\n The following weekend we had the pleasure of entertaining 4 <&French> jeune femme </&French> from Galway. I would describe them more as 'jolly' than <&French> 'jolie'. </&French> However much alcohol was consumed by all and soon 'jolly' became 'jollier' and finally progressed to <&French> 'jolie' </&French> under the influence of beer glasses. Ask Bill O'Neill sometime \u00d0 who else? Of course I was too sober to indulge\u00c9\n Things got pretty quiet after that, so myself and my entrepreneurial (my, what a big word for a medical student!) partner, Mr Fiachra Ryan took it upon ourselves to organise a 'mystery' tour. To most of us it still remains a mystery, not least to myself. The first destination was a bar in Bushmills where we spent considerable time getting drunk and \"singing\"    karaoke   . Considering I was directing the bus-driver    it 's   a wonder we ever got back at all. At least I did better than Fergie. Apparently he took it upon himself to direct the driver in a difficult reversing manoeuvre at the end of our journey and he navigated the bus directly into a railing. 'Good man, Fergy.' \n The last big social event on the calendar was the year formal last week in the Castle. I even brought a partner this year\u00c9.the inimitable, stunning, personable\u00c9Mr. Patrick Casey. Well he had just finished his exams that day, and he had no-one else to go out with to celebrate, and\u00c9well, yes, I am a sad bastard. Nevertheless he enjoyed it, I enjoyed it\u00c9all in all, a good    night 's   crack\u00c9.except for being blown out by a CU girl. I thought that we had her well corrupted and allegedly we had tackled before when we were both very drunk (hence I can't remember it), but obviously she still doesn't know the meaning of a good time!! \n Enough about me and my sad existence. What 's the crack with yourself. I hope you're still enjoying yourself and having a whale of a time and not doing any work. I suppose that the weather 's getting better (it couldn't be worse than here!) and that you're getting lovely and brown and attracting loads of tall, dark and handsome Belgians. Any scandal? \n Must go now before I run out of paper. It 's 2am and I have to still write up another case. So best of luck in the exams and other pursuits. I suppose you 'll be home again before me (27th August), so see ye then. \n <&French> Au revoir et bisses </&French> , Idiom or idiotic? Kevin. \n PS: My address in Aussie (19th June \u00d0 28th July) is; Queens Base Hospital, Sydney, NSW3691.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "9c766d80-4574-40b1-abc4-bbc2b624f91e", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.539153+00:00"}
{"text": "<Friends' letters>\n\n\n<$A>\n 21 February \n <&French> Bonjour </&French> Aoife! I will begin with an apology merited by the fact that I have totally failed to keep in contact. As you may know (or not know) letter writing is a pet hate of mine. I detest it with a vengeance but as Leah is leaving for Belgium this Thursday, I thought I 'd better put pen to paper and get scribbling.\n From what I can gather you 're having rather a good time without indulging in the pleasure of reading my letters! If this is the case you 're having a better time than us poor, bored and frustrated creatures back home. We have once again slid into the usual Friday night routine of Bunatee - Snack Bar - Food - Home which is excusing my limited French, boring the shit out of me. I am toying with the idea of leaving aside this Friday night ritual and reverting to Saturday night at the Egg with the devil incarnate and his merry band of faithful followers a.k.a. the Waterpolo crowd! Yes, I fear it is time to break the harness of habit in the search for bigger, better and more 'constructive' times. \n On the subject of waterpolo, Queen 's held the Intervarsity competition last weekend and, conveniently enough, won both the    men 's   and    women 's   competition due in part, at least, to a lucky draw! But anyway, griping aside it was a great weekend which finished in the Greenan Lodge (now known as 'Hotel Balmoral' - delusions of grandeur obviously) on Saturday night. Bob was up from Dublin although any time I saw him he had his face stuck to a beer can. Bill 's x-bird - Caoimhe made a surprise appearance and was in good form. Luke, with the rest of the Trinity team were present and did, in no uncertain terms make their presence felt by breaking a bed - 30 man/woman    trampolining   championships. The hotel kitchens were raided by D.I.T. which resulted in about <*> pound sign </*> 200 worth of food going amiss only to turn up in the shape of pavlovas and smoked salmon the next morning as they attempted to make a quick exit. All things considered it was a most enjoyable night although much to my disappointment I failed to tackle! My efforts were spurned - I crashed and burned! \n So, what else I hear you cry? Well Dermot and Allie are still doing the Siamese twins act - they started ballroom dancing last week! Dermot has got a new car - well    it 's  not exactly new -    it 's   8 years old - but goes! \n Jane and Ronnie are, to my knowledge organising a surprise party for SJ this weekend - something to look forward to although it means a night surrounded by lawyers. But, I 'm quite sure everyone will get thoroughly plastered and enjoy themselves. \n We went out last Saturday for Emma 's birthday. Emma, being Emma, however forgot to book dinner at Legends. On arriving, she told the waitress that dinner had been booked and that there had to be a mistake. We were given a table, the wine was opened and 5 minutes later we had to get up and leave - a tad embarrassing but funny all the same! \n Oh yes! Ken and I went to Boston for 4 days 3 weeks ago. We drank a lot, felt sick a lot and generally enjoyed ourselves. Kenneth didn't tackle Lisa as planned but settled for one of her (in my opinion) better looking friends! The girl was gurning at the airport as he left and had only met him the day before - obviously psychologically unbalanced! \n Well, I think    that 's   about it. Not bad for a start! Now that I know    it 's   not as bad I 'll write again -  when  I get a reply! \n In the meantime take care and enjoy yourself (as if you need me to tell you that!) \n All the hairy chest! Love Walter x \n\n\n<$B>\n 19/11/94 \n Dearest Aoife, It won't be long now until you 're home. I am really looking forward to seeing you. The Christmas lights were turned on, on Thursday night and it will be no time until Christmas. It is really annoying seeing the town so packed. I am glad to hear you are coping with all the partying so well. Life will seem so dull here by the time you come home. \n It is Saturday morning and I am just waiting around until I go to collect Luke from music. So much of a lie in (NOT!). Anything is better than 7am I suppose. I am just entering into my fifth week. The first two weeks were very shaky but I have settled in well now. This week was so hectic and it will be until Christmas. I have an interview on Wednesday for a trainee manager in Tecno, it sells camera and audio equipment. They have shops all around the UK. I don't think I would be too fussed, but the interview will be good experience and I will see what the pay would be like. I really would like the trainee manager position with Next. The pay is really good, training at <*> pound sign </*> 14,000. That would pay for a good few summer holidays. \n I would love to get away for a while at the moment. We were (the 5 girls that is)    supposed   to be going to Cushendall this weekend but Jane has to work tonight. We are definitely going next Saturday afternoon and coming home on Sunday evening. I am being a marshall next Saturday morning at a big fun run in town. One of the girls on the course is organising it as part of her placement and has recruited all of us to wear yellow bibs. \n I went to the cinema last night with SJ and Jane after having a row with Leonard on the phone. We went out on Tuesday night and arranged to go out somewhere on Thursday. I phoned on Thursday night and was told by Brendan (the one in the house that Jane tackled) that he was away home to Armagh. I was raging, he didn't even have the courtesy to phone. This was after him sending me a mushy letter to work on Tuesday. He phoned last night at about 6.30 and was out with his friends. He had the cheek to say at the end of the phone call  'Are you in a bad mood'  . He couldn't even see what he had done wrong - and I thought he  might  be different. He said he will phone me on Sunday. I hope he had a shitty night last night. Well enough of that, I will start getting angry again. \n Oh by the way Morgan Matthews phoned me on Sunday, I 'm seeing him this Monday night at the class rep meeting - I 'll keep you posted about that one. \n How is Victor, still as gorgeous as ever. You never know, perhaps you will get a snog before you come home for Christmas. I better go here and run my Mum into town - she 's starting her Christmas shopping (MAD!!). \n Miss you loads, lots of love Leah xoxo \n\n\n<$C>\n 16/11/94 \n Dearest Aoife, How are you? Thank-you for your lovely card, it was great to hear from you! I 'm really glad that you 're having such a wonderful time in Belgium - but don't be enjoying yourself too much, because we all can't wait to see you at Christmas.\n When you left first I was wondering what it must be like to have to settle into a whole new environment, with strange people in a strange country. I 'm sure it must have been quite daunting at first. So, when Sarah-Jane returned, and told us what a wonderful time you were having, and how nice the place was, I was really happy. What are the people in your house like? Although you didn't have any Irish or English students - it 's probably just as nice - more cultural! You must be fluent in French by now!! Do you have much free time, or is your course pretty full? I hope the work isn't too stressful. \n Well, you haven't missed too much back here! You 'll be glad to hear that Treacy has been in much better form recently, and I think she 's getting back to her old self, with a much more positive outlook on life. As you 've probably heard, she has had 2  \" brief encounters\"  with Walter, but I honestly believe that they have done her more good than harm. She said that she just needed to feel  'wanted'  again, and snogging Walter was just a way of fulfilling this. At first, I was a bit worried, thinking that she might just want to become > }>   dependent   on some-one, or get upset over Walter again, but she hasn't at all. She says that she realises that she just doesn't feel the way that she used to about Walter - and she 's completely emotionally detached. In fact it 's quite ironic, as now Walter seems to want her back, and she 's having none of it!! How life can change. \n You probably also heard that Ronan was not too pleased about Walter and Treacy snogging, but I think that he 's got so used to protecting Treacy, that he was just worried about her - and it may also have been a case of the old green-eyed monster! Anyway, it 's all fine now. \n Leah has also got a lovely new man - she seems really happy. Dermot is now snogging Laurie on a regular basis - could our bachelor end up in a relationship? And poor S.J. hasn't had an easy time with Jim having a new girlfriend. But she deserves better - and I 'm sure she 'll find someone else soon. \n As for myself - the same as usual. Bob - even though he 's not the most animated of people - is fine, and we 're getting on pretty well. So far so good! I 've been doing a bit of backing singing for Saibh 's band 'The Holsteins'. It 's been good crack! \n Well Aoife, I 'm looking forward to seeing you  very  soon, and apologies for not writing sooner - but you 're always in my thoughts and prayers. \n So be good, Take care and A bient&/\\ot, Lots of love,  Deirdre  xoxo \n\n\n<$D>\n Sun 30th April \n Dear Aoife, As promised I will try and write you something sensible and coherent to wish you good luck in studying and welcome back to Louvain-la-Neuve. I hope your journey wasn't too stressful, anyway a bottle of 'Pisang' should clear any post travel nerves! Well on Saturday night we showed Julia the high points of Laverys - which weren't really very high at all and I think I must have had a bad drink because I came home and puked all night and even when I went to Mass at 1.00 I had to leave the church and go into the loo and puke! I 'll definitely have to go to Confession now! -   Mon Morn   Julia has left and I 'm on the 5th floor of the library and my expos&/e is tomorrow so I 'm absolutely terrified, and I 'm going to do some work! \n See you soon. We miss you already. Emma xoxo", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "58c7025c-c7be-4e51-aeb2-1ba2ec60f299", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.540416+00:00"}
{"text": "<Home news>\n\n\n<$A>\n 22-9-94 \n Darling Ciara, Got your letter this morning and was so happy to hear how well you 're getting on \u00d0 but it made me wish so much that I could be with you! It sounds  so  brilliant. But, one thing is puzzling me, why have you not yet spoken to all the hunky men you say are all around? Better get a move on, before they are all snapped up! There are  no  hunky men here but at the moment I 'm sitting opposite Aoife 's Jim in the library so I 'd better not let him see this in case he gets offended! They 're still in lurve! I haven't done too much since I last wrote \u00d0 the    freshers '   ball was on last night but none of us went to it. Steve did come to aerobics with <unclear> 2 words </unclear> as did Gordon and it was the most hilarious thing I have ever seen. Their coordination was so bad that Steve managed to kick me in the head at one stage! Steven and Martin start back at J'town today are are  so  excited about it. Martin phoned me up last night and we 'd a great hour long chat but I 'll fill you in on that later. Keep having fun but take care. \n All my love,  EMMA  xo \n\n\n<$A>\n 23-11-94 \n Darling Ciara, Thought I would send this funky postcard to brighten up your day! Dillon reminds me loads of Sammy so you can put it on your wall to remind you of your beloved toe-rag!! Life has got slightly more interesting since I last wrote to you. Eva and I are hoping to see 'Wuthering Heights' in the G.O.H. tonight. At the weekend we five remaining girls are going to Cushendall (at last!) on Saturday for a night of drunken debauchery, which should be a good laugh and I 'm sure we 'll have lots of drinks on you! On Friday we have a medical pub crawl for children in need (yes    it 's   that time of the year again) so all in all it should be a fun <*> plus sign </*> drunken weekend! \n We have a professor from Trinidad staying in our house at the moment.    It 's   a bit of a nuisance but he 's really nice and interesting. The boys have arrived back from their waterpolo trip relatively unscathed but rather hung over. John and Tim both two-timed their respective \"girlfriends\" (i.e. Mary + Rosie) and who is surprised at that? We 'll miss you a lot up in Cushendall, as always. With all my love and hugs <*> plus sign </*> kisses, EMMA. \n\n\n<$A>\n 20th November 1994 \n My dearest Ciara, I just thought I would beat the rush and be the first person to send you a card for Christmas '94. I got your letter yesterday and was dead jealous of the brill time you 're having. I 'd really love to come over in January when you are off. I have an exam on Jan 24th so maybe I could fly over after that (if I get loads of money for Christmas / win the national lottery / rob a bank) and join in all your wonderful socialising. This has been the most boring weekend ever. Steve is in Cookstown for some SDLP thing. Martin and John are in    Clonmel   for the Freshers waterpolo competition. And the remainder of us were too boring, tired and fed up to plan anything for ourselves. On Friday night Ciaran and Sammy and Jim B. called to watch TV (The Friday night TV club as we have renamed ourselves) and last night I watched TV all alone. Wow \u00d0 the excitement is killing me!! \n I decided to revamp my bedroom this weekend (in lieu of a social life!) I have painted my bedside cabinet \"moonshine blue\" and my shelves and headboard \"   mulberry   crush\" and they look completely different and I feel as if I have a new room! In the midst of my painting I got locked out of the house in my t-shirt, jeans and socks. There was no-one else home so I crossed over to our neighbours looking like some deranged maniac with paint up my arms, face and hair and no shoes on to use their phone. I called Ciaran who came and rescued me. Firstly we tried to break into the house but after failing at that he drove me down to    Jonathan 's   to get his key \u00d0 thankfully he was in and the story ended happily \u00d0 <&French> \"Tout est bien, qui finit bien \u00d0 n'est ce pas?!\" </&French> We then headed off to Budget DIY and chose the \"   Mulberry   Crush\" paint which was in fact the highlight of my entire weekend! Sorry this is such a boring card but there is really not much to tell. The only good news is that my mum and dad are going to Lanzarote from Dec 29th \u00d0 Jan 5th so we 'll have lots of Christmas parties in your honour! \n BJ says she is feeling much more positive about the Tim saga \u00d0 which is a good sign \u00d0 I only hope it lasts as she deserves to be cheered up. Rachel and Alex had their first    lovers '   tiff on Friday night because he went home to Armagh on Thursday night without telling her. She gave him a real telling off and I 'm sure he 's really upset as he is so crazy about her. He sent her a love-letter to her work on Tuesday! Isn't that so sweet?! Anyway, that 's the height of our bizz for the moment. I 'll try and find something interesting to write about next time and if not I 'll just make it up!! \n See you  soon  \u00d0 Yeah! All my love,  Emma  xoxoxoxoxox \n\n\n<$A>\n Saturday, 14th January 1995 \n Darling Ciara, Well, I promised I would write today so here I am. I 'm actually cheating as it is 1.15am so really it is Sunday, 15th but I 'm sure you 'll find it in your heart to forgive me. How do you like my new fancy writing paper that Mum and Dad brought me back from Lanzarote? It 's scented but I don't know if the smell will last from here to Belgium \u00d0 go on and smell it. Well, what do you think? To smell or not to smell? You 'll have to let me know for future reference (for all my love letters etc) \u00d0 NOT!!! \n B-J and I have just spent a very civilised but most enjoyable evening together. We visited our favourite haunt \u00d0 yes you 've guessed it \u00d0 The Other Place in Botanic and sat in the window for hours drinking milkshakes and eating chocolate cake \u00d0 yum yum! We had some very enlightening conversations about love, life and the universe and all in all it was a very entertaining and relaxing Saturday night. \n Other than that the most exciting thing I have done since we parted is visited B <*> plus sign </*> Q garden centre with my dad. He broke our outside light whilst trying to change the bulb so we had to rush out and buy a new one before mum got home and noticed the old one had been smashed! Under the thumb or what!! \n I hope your flight went well and that you are glad to be reunited with all your Belgium family again. \n I am knackered now and have nothing else interesting to say so I 'll bid you good night and resume this tomorrow. \n 15-1-95 \n I 've just arrived back from a lovely afternoon in the Ferns and will finish this now so that you will receive it a.s.a.p. I was down for dinner and we had a really good time once I got over my usual initial weep at being in Downpatrick again. \n Eva was on the phone just now and seems v. excited about her trip to Belgium \u00d0 I 'm so jealous of her. It will be mega-depressing here with both you and her out of the country so forgive me for any morbid letters you get in the next fortnight! \n Martin called earlier and seems to be mega-laid back about his exams which start tomorrow \u00d0 some things never change! He says he has tomorrow morning to cover the 75 <*> per cent sign </*> of his course that he has yet to look at! \n I phoned Ciaran up yesterday and he seemed pretty miffed with me and it was a bit of a crap phonecall but he says Sammy seems right as rain again so don't you go worrying your pretty little head about him. \n I 'll head on now and swot up a bit on my Respiratory examination for    tomorrow 's  ward round. \n No doubt you 'll hear from me soon, All my love, Emma xoxo \n\n\n<$A>\n Sunday, January 29th 1995 \n Dearest Ciara, Hello, my pet, how are you? Glad to be reunited with your beloved wee sis. I bet! I 'm so jealous of her getting away to visit you \u00d0 I only wish I could do the same. No doubt you 'll have a madly riotous time \u00d0 can't wait to hear all the craic when BJ returns. \n So, we 're here at the end of yet another rivetingly exciting weekend in Belfast \u00d0 NOT! Friday as usual was Union night but still BJ and I have been unsuccessful on the Mullane front! Fred wasn't actually there so at least BJ had an excuse! I had a wee chat to David but that was the height of it. Last night, Rachel and I went to see \"Shallow Grave\" with Ciaran and Sammy. The film was really excellent but very gory and I spent half the film under the seat and the other half with my face buried in    Rachel 's   shoulder! We had a hilarious time anyway as Rach and I    were   trying our best not to look as if we were in a foursome with Ciaran and Sammy! The two boys    were   looking particularly unsavoury as    Ciaran 's   hair is now at least 2 weeks past its \"due a haircut stage\" and Sammy was wearing a shirt and tie under his anorak!!! (as he 'd been for an interview with Marks and Spencers that day) So Rach and I were leaping about in front of them in the queue and trying to    lose   them in the Pic'n'mix shop eh, eh!! We were being total bitches about the whole thing but the boys didn't seem to notice!! \n Ciaran asked me on Thursday to go to the Pharmacy formal so I said I would. I first of all tried to persuade him to take Siobhan but he said the evening is going to be very stressful for him as it is, with speeches etc, and if he took Siobhan it would be just too stressful for him to cope with! Now that I 've said I 'll go I 'm actually quite looking forward to it. It will be so nice to be out with a totally different crowd where nobody knows me or anything about me or Zach etc. It 's on February 15th so now I 'm dress hunting. BJ and I went shopping yesterday for your pressies (hope you like them \u00d0 I 'm so jealous as I would love them all myself) and I ended up buying a red dress for myself for <*> pound sign </*> 7!! in Top Shop.    It 's   a nice dress but it 's not very fancy so I 'll keep my eyes open for any others I may see in the next fortnight. \n I 'm feeling totally stuffed and sick at the moment as we were out for Sunday lunch with Gran and Uncle Gerry today. I got lentil croquettes in a mushroom sauce which was beautiful but the portions were too enormous for one person to manage \u00d0 probably the chocolate fudge sundae I had for dessert didn't help much either!! \n I hope you are continuing to be well fed and watered and warm and all those other essential things. \n I 'll love you and leave you and wish you a wonderful birthday and a brilliant year being 22 (you old fogie) and send you a big birthday hug and kiss via Betty-Jane, Lots of love and kisses and best wishes for Friday, Emma xoxo \n Hope you like the birthday card and that it    doesn't   scare you too much! Maybe you would be best  NOT  to stick this one up on your wall as if you came in v. drunk one night you might think it was real and trying  TO EAT YOU  !!!!", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d80d4d9c-16e1-480c-9c59-76651156b03f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.541205+00:00"}
{"text": "<From abroad>\n\n\n<$A>\nLong Island 09/08/'97\n Dear Aoife, How are you? Hope all is well in Belfast. Sorry that I didn't give you a call before I left but the week just seemed to fly by. I was actually very busy. My mother had me painting and I was also getting my CV together to send off for job applications. \u00d0 I spent about five days sitting at my desk writing covering letters. I can't imagine anything more tedious. If I don't get a job from this I 'm not applying for anymore!! \n Thank you so much for my birthday gift. It was so thoughtful of you. It arrived the day that I left so Mum forwarded it to me. I was reading another book but I just started reading a few pages of 'Angela 's Ashes' and now I 've abandoned the other book! \n I had a very nice birthday. Some of my relatives who are on Long Island came for lunch and I had a birthday cake etc. Bill called me to wish me a happy birthday. He also sent me flowers. Isn't that so sweet? It was quite a surprise! I didn't think that Bill was the flower type!! He 's called me a couple of times since and seems to be working very hard. He 's quite stressed out now that he 's come to the real writing part of his thesis. I 'm sure he 'll be fine though. I do feel bad that he 's there almost all alone. It must be so strange without 'the gang.' \n How are things with you? Are you feeling less bored yet? I think it would be a good idea to take a trip to Plymouth \u00d0 Ken would be very excited to see you. I could tell that he was missing you desperately after you left. Do you know yet where you 'll be next year? I hope that job at the department works out if your British Academy funding doesn't. \n Things are pretty good over here. Jacqueline 's 8th birthday was yesterday so we have some of Paulet 's family visiting this weekend. They are all leaving early tomorrow though, as are the Curtins. They 'll be gone for about 10 days altogether so we 've got some time off. Well, we do have to clean the house and change the beds etc but that shouldn't take 10 days!! Although Paulet 's brother is coming this Thursday with 11 people for the weekend so we 'll probably have to clean again after they leave. \n I 'm going to give Charles and Julia and Desiree and Joseph a call to see if we can all meet up somewhere between here and New Brunswick! It would be so nice to see them again. \n Well I 'd better finish 'cos Margaret and I are going to bike to the post office and the post will be leaving soon! Say hi to Sarah Jane, Jacinta and your Mum for me. Looking forward to seeing you in September with 'the boys'!! \nTake care, Lots of love, Violet.\n PS I got these photos developed after I went home \u00d0 I think it 's such a lovely photo. I got doubles and I 'm sending Ken the other copy! \n\n\n<$A>\n22/10/97\n Dear Aoife, Thanks for your letter. Glad to hear that your Ph.D has worked out, although you must have been a bit worried for a while. \n Well, I 'm still in London but I 'm probably heading home early next week. Bad news and some good news on the job front. None of the interviews I did here resulted in job offers. Basically, my problem   is   I haven't done any work experience and therefore they are questioning my commercial awareness and my commitment to commercial law! It 's very disheartening but I 'm remaining philosophical in believing that everything happens for a reason. The good news is that the firm in New York called me and said they wanted to hire me. I can't go yet though because they have to get a work permit or some sort of immigrant visa for me. They are working on that at the moment but it takes quite a while to process. So I just have to wait and see what happens. I 'm hoping that I 'll be able to go before Christmas. At least they sound like they do want me to come over so I 'm quite positive about the whole thing. Once I get some work experience I could reapply for jobs in London or I 'm actually thinking of staying in New York and taking the New York Bar exams. The law degree from here is recognised over there so I wouldn't have to do three years of law school, I 'd just have to do a crash course to prepare for the exams. It certainly wouldn't be easy but I could qualify much quicker over there than here. Tommy is actively encouraging me to stay in New York and qualify there if I get the chance as he doesn't recommend doing the LPC. He is bored to tears I think. I 've seen him a few times since I 've been here. Before Bill left, we met up a couple of times, once with Ed and Ronnie and Laura (PGCE). I saw him a couple of weeks ago \u00d0 we met for a drink in a pub in Fleet Street. Ed organised it but never turned up (apparently Pierre was over for the weekend so that may have been this excuse!) Tommy 's friend William was there (one of the guys who was at the Hughes Ball) and Dan McShea, the Canadian guy who was on the LLM. \n Tommy rang on Friday but I wasn't here so I must give him a call and meet up before I leave. I went to Normandy last Wednesday 'til Sunday. My cousin Laura was visiting from New York and she and her friend Rex who work for the same bank in London rented a house so she asked me to come too. There was also Rex ' brother and a friend of his from Oxford. It was really good fun. We took the ferry from Portsmouth to Cherbourg and the house was about 1/2 an hour from there. \n This weekend I 'm thinking of going to Cambridge on Friday and then Nottingham on Saturday to see my Italian friend Tina. I also want to see a friend of mine who 's in Chester doing the LPC. I haven't seen him since graduation last year and if I don't see him now I won't see him for ages. I 'm not sure I can fit all that in one weekend! \n I 've spoken to Bill a few times since he left. I called him on Monday night \u00d0 his mother answered the 'phone and told him that it was someone with an English accent so he said he knew it was me! He 's in good form but a bit bored although he 's busy filling in Ph.D funding applications. He finally got his e-mail to work and has had lots of messages. He heard from Steve Wright who seems to be settling well in LA. He said all the women are hot but not very smart so you don't get very much intelligent conversation!! Charles and Julia are doing very well and are very excited about their imminent arrival. Due date is November 27th. \n Bill 's brothers are on reading week from college so he and Tommy are going camping in Algonquin Park for a few days. I 've really missed him since he left so if I end up in New York at least I 'll be able to go visit. \n Well, I must go. I 'm busy here painting the bathroom for my lovely sisters! So I must get that second coat on! When I go home I 'm planning a trip to Belfast to visit several people who I haven't seen in ages so I 'll give you a call when that happens. I 'm going to work for my brother in Dublin and stay with Margaret at: 199A Griffith Avenue, Drumcondra, Dublin 9 \u00d0 so now you can keep track of me! \n Take care, Lots of love, Violet.\n PS Say hi to Sarah Jane, Jacinta and your Mum for me.\n\n\n<$A>\nFebruary 3, 1998\n Dear Aoife, This card  was  actually in the birthday section although I 'm not suggesting that you do your hair like this!! \n Have a very HAPPY BIRTHDAY. I wish I could be there to celebrate with you and Ken again \u00d0 he told me that you were hoping to make it over for his birthday so you 'll probably be in Cambridge for yours too. \n I keep forgetting to ask Bill for your e-mail address\u00c9I will soon and hopefully you 'll have had a message from me before you get this. However my head is becoming more like a sieve as each day passes so I 'll give you my e-mail address: vbogs@ola.com. I 'm enjoying living and working in NY. The people at the firm are really nice and I 'm being kept very busy which is good.   Hope all is going well with your PhD. I sometimes wish I was still a student \u00d0 I think I'm still pining for Cambridge and the wonderful time we had\u00c9.Hopefully we 'll be on-line soon, \nTake care, Lots of love, Violet.\n\n\n<$A>\nFebruary 3, 1999\n Dear Aoife, Wishing you a very happy birthday. Have a great day! \nLots of love, Violet\n Aoife, Sorry I haven't been in touch in ages. I feel like I have been cut off from the rest of the world studying for the Bar exam \u00d0 I have no life! Less than four weeks to go so it 's getting kind of scary \u00d0 I have so much to do. \n How have you been? Have you been back to Cambridge yet to finish your research? \n Well, hope all is well with you. Will talk to you soon.\nLove, Violet.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f1f08f7f-dcae-454e-8e33-f717a664f279", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.541999+00:00"}
{"text": "<Letterkenny news>\n\n\n<$A>\n Natalie \n Dear Natalie,\nHere is the R/Coat I found it in the wardrobe. When you mentioned it, I said thats Betty 's meaning it would be too small for you, but on checking it I think you 'd get into it alright. The guy in the Drugs haul is one of the 'Martins' Thorndale. He 's for the  chop.  \n A taxi man in Letterkenny was attacked by four young fellows \u00d0 masked and armed with Base Ball Bats. He is in intensive care. They took his money and car. Convoy origin is suggested. Crime is on the increase. We have had a terrible storm Sat. and today. It is bucketing. Never mind the writing, I 'm tired. I 've just finished apple tart and scones. \n Betty 's interview is over for Oatfield. She starts next Mon. 8.30 a.m. till 5.30 p.m. <*> pound sign </*> 4.50 per hour. It 's a great relief as looking at her roaming the town and no job was devastating. She 's all happy herself, although you know me and 'Oatfield'. It 's as good as washing floors in the hosp. I suppose. As she says herself. It will be good to have something to get up for. \n Hope you got over your disappointment (Bike). Andy was all sad for you. Did you hear about the ten students from Trinity who went on Safari to Kenya. Two girls aged 21 yrs. were killed. They would have been graduating next year \u00d0 Engineering. The jeep it seems overturned. A young life thrown away. \n Deirdre has gone to Killybegs on a cookery course. Roger was saying to Betty that she wouldn't be long in it. \n Students are not allowed into Sr. Eva 's or the Metropolitan. (meaning Reginal, I suppose). This letter came today so here goes. I rang \"King 's Inn\" and was told you require to do Irish Constitutional Law from Sept. until May then you can do the exam. \n Natalie I 'm off now to post this. Hope all is well with you. Mum XX \n\n\n<$A>\n Sat. night. \n Dear Natalie,\n Enjoyed your 'phone calls. Hope your cold is better by now. I keep wondering what you look like now. Keelin 's son (Andy Joe) has got engaged to Dina. It 's seven years since Lorcan got married. Jane <*> ampersand </*> Lorcan had their tickets for a foreign holiday and Jane took ill, a very bad kidney infection. Isn't that disappointing. \n I heard Billy O'Dea announced Mary 's engagement on Highland Radio. Could you just imagine him telling everyone about Mary, - the Pussie. \n Wait till you hear this. Betty met Padraig Kelly last night \u00d0 he was at a stag night for a fellow out at Heathom. He was asking for everyone and told Betty that Leah is starting work in the hospital in Oct. He said her hours are 7.30 a.m until 7. p.m Wonder who is going to look after the children. Says he I think  them  hours are ridiculous. I 'd say she soon got fed up out there. Gaye was. I had this dream one night that Leah got so fat that she tried to do away with herself on two occasions. \n Betty starts work to-morrow, sorry Monday morning. It will be some change after 4 months. She was thinking of going to Whitethorn. Tom O'Shaughnessy owns the house <*> ampersand </*> lives there. <*> pound sign </*> 30 per week and no phone. She heard some mention of drugs so decided against it. Its very far out anyhow. \n Thousands of people marched in Belfast today in protest against the Peace Process. \n Three quarter length shiny coats are all in the shops now. Top Shop has them at <*> pound sign </*> 35.00. It 's warm here although very, very heavy rain. Although the winter stuff is in the shops, I 'd think twice before I 'd buy it yet. \n You must be working very hard out there. Watch you don't kill yourself. I know you Natalie, work till you drop. \n Shane Miller had a new roof put on the house up there but left Fintan 's house out of it. It 's the meanest thing ever I 've seen. Fintan is flying about in a white car (rust box) and dressed to kill. Ciaran or is it Kieron has gone to live with the mother. The new Hotel which was Dillons is all painted now \u00d0 very bright colours so that will be nice for the town. They 're having a disco also. \n Gov. turned down Sr. Eva 's licence in court (disco licence) as no safety escape. The judge said  \"whatever you say I will agree to it.\"  \n The 'Darcy boy' is back from jail and drinking in Sr. Eva 's. He 's got up in the world. Four men tried to break in to the general Hospital a week ago, so they are stepping up security there. \n The 'Sunday World' printed a story that Ronan Keating <*> ampersand </*> Brian Kennedy were caught in bed by Ronan 's wife who took a baseball bat and smashed up the car. I know what I would have smashed up. Wonder is it true. It may not be true. \n When you get this form, make sure you send it back promptly. Keep it clean also as they are very fussy. Send it priority air-mail. That 's what I do. \n Q. Do you know why the squirrel swims on his back (a.) He doesn't want to get his  nuts  wet. No, I 'm not going to explain the joke this time. Cheryl Irvine got married today. Do you remember the twit. He 's Italian John 's son Benjamin is marrying a Wren. Catherine Wren is her name and guess the name of her parents house 'TWO BEAKS' It suits doesn't it. \n Belinda Braithwaite is working in Magee 's Chemist. She 's glad she got out of 'Mace' \u00d0 High Rd. We saw Edna McAfee yesterday. She 's a tough woman as fat as fat can be, but she didn't forget to give us a big wave. \n I see in the paper that Tommy Neale Carnamuggah is up on a drugs charge. \n I heard there 's a guy very ill in hospital as a result of having his drink spiked. It 's getting very common now. \n Did you hear about the women in Raphoe. There was some kind of a fight and the guards were called. As soon as they arrived at the house she starts OI! OI! I smell bacon. Go back to the pig house where you came from. \u00d0 to the guards. She 's in big trouble. \n Natalie, I 'm laughing here. You can sing now.\nMy old man 's a Dutchman\nHe wears a Dutchman 's hat\nHe wears old grimy trousers\nAnd he lives in a Dutchman 's flat. \n Good luck to you and hope all works out about the flat. It should be warmer. I can just picture the two of you in the Mercedes. \n Love from all here \u00d0 <&Irish> agus mise fos. </&Irish> I hope the good Lord will look after you both. \nMum XX\n P. S. \n I rang the Institute and 15th November is the deadline for application. She said anything after that will be disqualified. Anyhow she is sending out an application form to this address. \n Betty is on her 2nd day at work and loves it. She 's up at 7.15 a.m and works from 8.30 a.m till 5.30 p.m. They get five breaks 2 twenty mins. 2 fifteen mins and 1 half-hr. It 's great to see her getting up in the morning. She 's working to 7 p.m to-night and Sat. until 10 o'clock \u00d0 that 's overtime. A girl \u00d0 BAT she 's called (Christian name \u00d0 Siobhan) from upwards of Lurgybrack started same day so they are very  pally.  It might help her to get rid of that other  twit.  She got a lift with Dara McDermott yest. evening. \n You know Anne O'Dwyer who works in \"Derry People\". Well, her son 16 yrs. hanged himself on Mon. morning (yesterday). Isn't that awful. What is wrong at all, pressures I suppose. \nTar \u00d0 a \u00d0 Natalie. Must Run.\nMum XXX.\n\n\n<$A>\n Tues. \n Dear Natalie,\n Usually, I 'd have a letter mailed by now, but I 've been very sick. It hit me so suddenly terrible pains and violent headache. I 'm on antibiotics and still have the awful sore head <*> ampersand </*> dizziness. Never have I been so sick. Doc. says it 's a virus. I swore it was meningitis but who knows. Anyhow I just had to write today to keep you in touch. \n A son of John Sheridans was attacked. Sorry, I just remember I told you on the 'phone. The assailant was a tinker and got over the border. A guy was sacked in Betty 's job. He was caught at the lockers. Another lady got the walk for stealing sweets. \n Why is a Politician like a baby 's nappy. The both are full of shit. \n We have the nurses strike today. The Picket was set up at 8 a.m 27 1/2 thousand nurses. God help anyone who has to go to hospital. \n You 'd think Skip knew there was something afoot for him as he 's started queuing at the back door when he needs to go to the  toilet.  Remember the story (true one) about the man going to shoot the dog and the dog ran away and never came back. \n I hear Brendan Darcy is not so well. He has the same as Larry had. I was just saying his poor wife never had a holiday (leisure) always looked so tired and worn and now when the family are grown up her husband has to be nursed. \n Julia <unclear> 2 words </unclear> daughter has had her twins. A boy <*> ampersand </*> girl. The wee boy was born without one eye. There is an eyelash and a socket but minus the eye. I feel so sorry for them. DR. McDermott told them he had never seen anything like it before, all the years he is in practice. They didn't want anyone to know at the start but they had to tell it eventually. You know, I was sick when I got that news and all through the night that 's all I saw \u00d0 the baby 's face. Poor wee pet it 's not fair. Could you imagine the shock they got. \n McCarry 's off Licence has been taken over as a Xmas Day shop, moving bloody Santas looking out the window and it 's only Oct. Oh! by the way, I tried Rachel 's number many, many times without success. Rang again yest. and here she was answering the phone. So, I told her I had a Confession <*> ampersand </*> an apology. Oh! she couldn't recollect anything (by the way) but she was so nice and spake so well, seemed real friendly. She asked me when were you coming and when I told her she said Oh! that's great, can't wait to see her again. So now, put your mind at rest. \n Sixteen houses are being built behind Jimmy Mullins. (in that field) I can't understand Jimmy letting go his privacy. Dom saw the planning application so it 's true. \n There 's a huge supermarket-come shopping centre started between Dunnes Stores <*> ampersand </*> Daly 's monuments. No wonder people say Letterkenny is going to choke. \n The new Theatre has opened. It 's beautiful. Dom <*> ampersand </*> I are at it often dressed in our finest gear!!! \n Annette in Vivaldi 's is pregnant again. She 's going out with a Belfast man. \n Speaking of Belfast, there was an attempt made on a Post office on the Ballysillan Rd. yest. Sledge Hammers were used and the man inside fired a shot and killed one of the raiders. There 's a big \"He Haw\" about it. \n A fellow from Letterkenny won a million pounds in the Lotto. He 'd just built a house and seeing he 's married he will look after it (the money). \n A taximan here shot the Runway I mean the Roundabout out the road \u00d0 went right over it. He damaged the car to the tune of <*> pound sign </*> 30,000. No wonder I don't trust them. \n The astronomer (Faith) was telling me that Angela Sullivan is taking the death very badly. She doesn't go out now. It 's all a shock at the time but when the crowds leave reality sets in and more especially now at this time of year. \n It 's just 67 days till Xmas wouldn't that sicken you. It will take the back seat this year with the    millennium   on the horizon. Fred Kilbane has bought a site on the De Valera Rd. (opposite here) for a fire station. They hope to start it next year. Billy O'Dea will be having an Erection every time the bugle blows (now, I mean the fire siren!!). They will be too close for comfort. \n Suzie has vamoosed and Gorteen lives on \u00d0 happily. I have so many bad memories of her. She used to shoot out loud from the bottom of the road. Aye!! Rosie Mulligan. Oh. years ago when she was at her worst. Time works wonders, I say. Maire (next door) has got a fecking cat and I walked into the front room yest. and there she was. I nearly died. Came in the window. I 'll get her some day with the brush. \n I hear Cormac is back. He 'll be trying to sneak back to the house now, seeing the old pair have gone. Betty says Roger is very nice. \n A form came from the Royal Mail. I don't know whether to post it or not. Maybe I will. It will give you a better chance. \n Betty tells me there 's rats in Wilowbrook \u00d0 Carlotta 's place. They ate their couch. I would go crazy. I wouldn't sleep in the damned place. That site is too low lying anyhow. The guy who Andy Joe went to see in Australia has arrived home bag <*> ampersand </*> baggage. His wife is a sister (nurse) and has got a job in L/Kenny. He 's a Civil Engineer and has got work in Derry and they 've bought a house in Letterkenny. \n How are you getting on out there? \n I just hope you have the same address. We have lovely weather here. Looks like late Summer. \n Ring on Friday around 4 p.m. That 's the best time. \n Look \u00d0 a \u00d0 loo and good luck.\nMum X \nExcuse writing\nblame it on the tablets.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ffa38ced-a925-4740-aad3-27c32706219d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.542629+00:00"}
{"text": "<India letters>\n\n\n<$A>\n\n The Elephant God  GANESH  \n Boxing Day 2000 \"Hermitage\", Kamalpur Orissa \n Dearest Angela, I hope you had a lovely xmas and got all you wanted from Santa. I have to admit each time I thought about xmas away from all my family and friends I was a little bit sad but I am happy to say that we had a really beautiful xmas here, so good I had to write immediately and tell you about all our adventures since we left Calcutta (I assume you got my email \u00d0 angelobrin@ola.com). We decided to come to Orissa on the advice of the french man we met in Delhi to stay with these people she told us about. After a full day in a train from Calcutta we reached Cuttak where we spent one night in    luxury   Already we were off the beaten track, we had to stay in a    luxury   hotel because there were no guest houses for tourists, they never get any. Next day we headed for Athmallik. We were told it was only a 35km journey but after 2 hrs in a bus we got a little suspicious, there was no village in sight for miles and we were heading really out into the wild \u00d0 jungle all around. Upon asking we discovered Athmallik was 250km away and the bloody journey took ages! It was 9pm when we arrived, totally dark and not a guest house in sight. We had made up our minds to spend the night in a temple or hay shed when a young Indian man rescued us. He took us to a guest house which was closed and got us a room telling us he would return the following day to take us to the people we planned to stay with. However he returned 1/2 hr later and insisted we came home to his family. This was about 10pm on xmas eve just to keep you up to date. So we went back with him to meet his parents and family. They were so nice, kept telling us how    privileged   they were to have us in their home and they really treated us like royalty. I thought I 'd only get to see places like this on T.V. Angela, it is amazing. Nobody ever comes here either so the people think    it 's   a really big thing to have foreigners in their village. Everyone lives in either stone or mud houses with thatched roofs. All kinds of fruit and veg. grow here, the jungle is full of wild banana <*> plus sign </*> mango trees and I 'm told wild elephants, deer and tigers live there too. Anyway, we woke up on xmas morning to the whole family bearing bunches of fresh flowers and cups of tea shouting happy xmas. Even though they don't celebrate it themselves they wanted to make it special for us. Then the father, he 's a brahmin (highest caste hindu) blessed us and told us we were his son and daughter, his family was ours because we made them all so happy by coming to stay. Then we took family photos with our new \"family\"! It was really touching, they don't even realise how much they helped us and I thought they were going to cry with joy when we gave them a fruit cake we had bought for xmas! We went with our \"new brother\" Chandra for a walk and guess where he took us \u00d0 to visit the King of Athmallik! I had tea with real royalty on xmas morning. The Palace is lovely with old photos of all the ancestors on the walls. It looked like it was decorated in 1920 and never redone \u00d0 lovely. Oh, the ex-minister for tourism of Orissa was also present! I think I 'll only have tea with kings and politicians from now on, peasant folk are too common!! \n After this little interlude we went to visit a Shiva temple in the jungle and surrounded with hot springs. Finally we had to head for Kamal Pur to find the people whose address we had. As we were leaving the family told us to come back anytime it was our home and we would always be welcome. Chandra got a jeep to take us right up to the jungle through a small tribal village to meet Sammy <*> plus sign </*> Chauncey, the people the woman we met said would welcome us if we came. Chauncey won't be here until new year 's eve but as soon as we arrived Sammy got out the rice wine, put more food in the pot and said we could treat the place like our own home as long as we liked. Really, the people here are so welcoming. Sammy is Catholic so he was celebrating xmas and was delighted to have some people to share it with. Xmas dinner was delicious, pilau rice, vegetables, chicken curry and sweet rice pudding all served on big banana leaves and eaten with your right hand And another xmas cake we had brought for Sammy <*> plus sign </*> Chauncey for xmas. It is tropical fruit <*> plus sign </*> cashew nut cake <*> plus sign </*> absolutely delicious. \u00d0 this is real India Angela. Miles from anywhere, no electricity in these hills (down in the village 6km away there is) totally surrounded by small mountains and thick jungle. In a couple of days one of the old men is going to take us into the jungle interior \u00d0 sounds like Indiana Jones style! I am so lucky to have had the opportunity to come here, really it is like the middle ages. Cooking on an open fire, getting water from the well. It is an excellent experience for me and a good chance to think about what is really important in life. These people have nothing except what they grow or make with their own hands yet they are so content with life and what they have. There is a bonfire and jungle traditional music planned for new years eve and by that time there will be more people here. We plan to stay for 2 or 3 weeks at least before moving on, maybe to the beach for a while. I 'd love if you would come with me to India some day. I 'm sure you would love it as much as I do, it is a different world. \n Email me with all your news, did Paul go to Australia, is Timmy still with Caitriona, how are Noirin <*> plus sign </*> Christopher getting on, did you see Bernie <*> plus sign </*> Glen at xmas, how is your course going, did you go up to my house at xmas, do you hear from Sarah at all, tell everyone I was asking for them. \n Keep yourself well and safe, enjoy the finer things in life and don't stress over your course too much. \n If I 've learned anything it is to take things as they come and they will generally come alright. \n Take Care <*> plus sign </*> lots of love your best friend Aisling XXX. \n P.S. There is a little chicken trying to make friends with my ankles at the moment, I 've never been this close to one that I 'm not going to EAT before!! \n DINNER?\n P.P.S Next day \u00d0 The new years eve bonfire had to be lit last night to scare off the elephants who were making loud trumpeting noises <*> plus sign </*> threatening to come too close to the house, all the villagers were out blowing bugles <*> plus sign </*> banging doors keep them far away \u00d0 what an amazing place!! \n\n\n<$A>\n Jaisalmek, Jul 16th \n Dear Angela, You sound as if you are having a fairly lively summer from your emails. What about your birthday!! You must have been really pissed off to find out about Noirin and Timmy 's antics. But when people drink 2 bottles of whiskey and a load of aftershocks they can't really be held responsible for their actions, even when they are this bad. Stanley and Mairead have split up! When? Last time we saw them they had plans laid out for the rest of the year. Poor them. If you can, ask Stanley to email me and Mathieu because we 've only got a joint email address for them. Deirdre told me that Sarah is moving to America on Sept 7th. Things must be working between her a Kevin. Me and Mathieu are getting on brilliant at the moment. Since after xmas we started getting on so well and since we came here it 's been even better. The shit thing is we are probably going to have to split up after Bakker season finishes. I need to do something with my life, I still don't know what but I don't think I 'll be able to do it and stay with Mathieu. We do talk about whats going to happen later but can either of us really plan it? I don't think so. It really is depressing me when I think about it. I 'm also really worried about what I 'm actually going to do, because Angela, I simply don't have a clue. You are so lucky to have a postgrad. to do. Do you know yet about funding? The thing about being here is you have so much time to sit and think. And the more thinking I do the more confused I get. Don't get me wrong. I 'm having the most amazing time,    it 's   just these worries keep popping into my head from time to time. I wish you were here for me to talk to, I miss our wee 10 hour chats about life, love, etc, \u00c9. Keep up with the informative emails. Don't mention my worries in them because Mathieu reads them usually too and I don't want him to think I 'm writing dismal tales of woe about our future to all my friends. \n We 've been here in Jaisalmec for a week now. A change from the mountains I wanted and you couldn't get more of a change than this.    it 's   an ancient city built within and around the walls of a huge fort right in the middle of the desert in Rajasthan near the Pakistani border. All the buildings, including the fort itself are of sandstone. Everything glows gold when the sun is setting. Being here is like going back in time. The city within the fort hasn't changed in the last 1,000 years (except that now theres a water supply and a few palaces have been turned into hotels?) .. and of course electricity. Life for the people here is probably pretty much the same I imagine. Today being Sunday, lots of desert people, tribals who live in the villages in the desert around Jaisalmek came into the city to go to the markets. The men wear really colourful turbans and long white shirts and dhotis (long pieces of cloth wrapped around    their   waists and between their legs) Most of them had really long moustaches. They also wear loads of gold earrings and rings. The women wear day-glo bright saris or long full skirts and shawls. They also wear huge amounts of jewellery \u00d0 mostly silver. Watching them coming and going on their camels was like watching a film on T.V. \n There is a government bhang shop here \u00d0 bhang = skunk (almost). They make bhang lassis, they 're like yoghurt drinks full of bhang \u00d0 very tasty and lekker stoned!    It 's   a good place to sit for the afternoon watching the market and camels and traditional musicians who always seem to be wandering around. The food here is gorgeous. I was worried before I came to India that I 'd get sick of spicy food all the time but I 'm loving it more and more. Sometimes ordering your food in restaurants can be a bit of an ordeal. The spelling mistakes on the menu are hilarious \u00d0 screamable eggs? fried children? corn flex and honi? chess omelate?!!! We are sitting here trying to decide where to go and eat! The weather here has been quite hot for the first few days we arrived. Then yesterday and the day before it rained so today has been really fresh and nice \u00d0 still hot though!", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "0dd2b3b9-4618-4630-b881-b1fc83e21106", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.543684+00:00"}
{"text": "<Donegal letters>\n\n\n<$A>\n 26/7/94 \n Well hello there, How are you all? Now from what I hear you 're all doing pretty o.k. I 've already written you a letter but according to your last letter to Aoife you mustn't have got it. I posted it about three or four weeks ago and it was airmail so I 'm sure you should have had it by now. Anyway if you get it before this I 'm sorry if they both have the same news in them. \n I 'm really glad that you all got jobs and somewhere to stay and stuff. From what you said in your postcards etc. you seem to be having a big massive ball. You bastards! I can't believe that bud is only 50 cents a can.    That 's   unbelievable! It costs me about fucking <*> pound sign </*> 15 to get pissed where it only costs you about 4 dollars. As I said before you bastards. Anyway while we 're on the subject I don't know when I had a big drinking session like the ones we used to have in good old Jordanstown. I can't wait until October, it 'll be great to be off our faces again you know the old gang together again. \n Anyway as you probably know Aoife and me are still together. It 's a real bastard now during the summer as we hardly see each other (we didn't get jobs in Belfast as you probably know). I was lucky enough I got a job at home but the pay is shite and I usually work six days a week. It 's a shoe shop and it gets really busy. I 'm really fucked off with it already and I 've only been there just over a month. I would love to leave it and go away with Aoife for a while but it looks like I won't be able because I need money for next year and that. \n Anyway    that 's   what I 'm at the minute, stacks of excitement or what! Oh yeah! I 've got a house for next year but I couldn't get a six bedroom house for all of us. I 've had to get a house with Simon (my mate from home) and this other fella. It 's a real bastard because I 'm sort of stuck on my own now I don't know what Brian, Steo and Edward are going to do but I 'm trying my best to help them find somewhere. Och it 's not too late and I 'm sure they 'll get somewhere. Anyway my house   is   in 17 Cedar Row it 's a wee street off Davenport avenue. The house is really nice, everything is almost brand new. The rent is <*> pound sign </*> 100 a month but I couldn't find anything much cheaper. I think the lads are a bit annoyed with me. Brian 's grand he rings me all the time but I hardly ever hear from Edward or Steo. I really hope I don't lose them as friends over something so stupid. There was nothing else I could have done, it was the only way we could have split up the six of us. I couldn't expect them to live with somebody they didn't know. I really wanted to live with them boys (Steo etc.) because the crack would have been great. Och well, there 's nothing I can do now. \n Now I hope you two boys are behaving yourself over there. I 'd be shocked now if you even looked at them evil american girls. You know you poor innocent irish fellas could get yourselves in trouble over there. You know them girls have only one thing on their minds - sex. Now I 've only one thing to say to you - YOU JAMMY BASTARDS. You 'll have to write back to me and tell me all the crack, you know all the stuff you couldn't tell Aoife. \n Didn't you say you were coming back at the end of August? Well if you are, make sure you ring me when you get back (0103536395721) or better still come down here and stay a few nights. There 's plenty of room. We 'll be able to meet up with the boys and go out and get completely paralectic. \n Anyway I reckon I 'd better head on now. I 've loads more to tell you and ask you but I 'll save it until you get back. Look after yourselves now and write back soon 'cos I really want to hear from you. \n See you all soon, your old pal, Ciar&/an \n\n\n<$B>\n 27/7/94 \n Brian Fielding, Letterkenny, Co. Donegal. Eire,  Europe?  \n Dear Lisa, How the fuck is it going. Sorry for keeping it so long but I am flat out working in the Bar in Carrigart 6 days a week. It was nice of you to drop me a line twice because I am missing J/town really bad. You can't do anything  Mad!  Down here. The barwork is really hard but I think I am beginning to enjoy it. I was 2 hours late for work this morning. I was supposed to be in at 10.00 am <*> ampersand </*> open at 11. am but I woke at 12.00 am. The boss phoned up <*> ampersand </*> gave out fucking shit. Hay - Hay it was funny. What 's new <unclear> 1 word </unclear> Steo in a bad mood with me kind-of 'cause I was supposed to go to Quigleys Point with him one night <*> ampersand </*> stay with him but I had a very busy night at work <*> ampersand </*> couldn't get off. Oh! by the way I got the Zippo the other day. About time. I waited a fuckin' century for it. Silly fuckers ran out of stock. Steo 's in great form. He visited me in the pub when I was at work. Himself, Edward <*> ampersand </*> Edward 's brother Geoff. I was really fucking thick that night, it was very hard for me to work while they were there. I knew Steo was really disappointed but I couldn't do nothing. It was funny I was going to quit <*> ampersand </*> walk out. When they were going I went outside <*> ampersand </*> Steo wanted me to go for a quick joint down the side. He 's mental crack. Nicest    fellow   I 've ever met, after you that is ..... fuck off. It is very hard to get out when    you 're   behind the bar. Last thursday night I got off <*> ampersand </*> went out with Rick. Rick couldn't believe what I was drinking. He was drinking guinness <*> ampersand </*>   I   was    drinking double vodkas + Coke. I must have had about 15 doubles. I spent 54 quid. to be Exact. I was well gone at the end of the night <*> ampersand </*> all I remember is going back to some girls caravan snogging her <*> ampersand </*> fucking off up the road in one of my Ex-girlfriend 's car. Then    puking   my guts out in front of the house. Good night! On the other hand now I 'm trying to settle down <*> ampersand </*> study for my Exams. I failed 2 (maths/Economics shit!) <*> ampersand </*> a physics coursework. I 'm a bit worried. I don't think I 'm going to make it through. But I 'll try my best. \n Rick 's in great form <*> ampersand </*> so is the family. I was speaking to Fintan <*> ampersand </*> he 's in good form. Him <*> ampersand </*> Aoife are still going  really  strong. I think I 'll go now Lisa. I was never a good letter writer, this is the first bit of writing I 've done since the exams, (as you can see). I can't wait 'till we all get together again, I miss the crack. Take care of yourself. I    hear   there 's a dangerous disease over    there   to keep an eye on its to do with going with girls <*> ampersand </*> kissing <*> ampersand </*> stuff. (called  Aids  ) ............. . \nGive me another shout if you 've time O.K. See you soon, Take care,\n Brian \n\n\n<$C>\n September 3rd Rathmullan. \n Well Viv, You 've just given me your address so I thought I 'd sit down and    write   you a wee letter before it 's time for work. I 've nothing very exciting to tell you but anyway. Like I was saying I 'm working in the Water 's Edge. Its ok. I don't mind the actual work but I hate having the Meaneys for my bosses. Money-grabbing, greedy bastards with no consciences. Pay 's shit - <*> pound sign </*> 3 but tips are usually good enough - other waitresses are nice apart from one or two. New bloke started a couple of days ago. He 's SOOO stupid. Every time I see him I just want to slap him. He walks around with this really gormless expression on his face all day long, spills food on people - forgets to leave orders with the chef etc etc. And I suspect he pockets the tips - we 're supposed to share them out at the end of the night. Oh well. \n I had a superb, fantastic <*> plus sign </*> wondrous time in Ecuador - even better than last year, love the place so much <*> plus sign </*> can't wait to go back. I 'm dead excited about going to Cuba too - but need to start gathering in the money fast. I have to have paid 80 <*> per cent sign </*> of the sponsorship <*> pound sign </*> 1800 by November 5th - gasp! I 'll do it no problem though. I guess. I just need to focus for a    while  . My biggest problem is that all the money I collect here, I have to convert to sterling and could lose up to 23p in the <*> pound sign </*> - Imagine. So expensive. I got my funding in the end up for this masters - only fees though. So I 've applied for a couple of jobs in Queen 's - in the library <*> plus sign </*> in QFT, which would be spot on <*> plus sign </*> <*> pound sign </*> 3.60 for doing nothing much at all. \n Our new house is dead on. It needs a lick of paint, which I 'll do next week on my days off, probably. I 'm really happy to be living in a small house with just Nuala <*> plus sign </*> Ciara - no smeggy boys around the place. You 'll have to pay us regular visits before you head away to Ozzie land. Did I tell you Declan 's going to stay on there? He decided he likes it so much he doesn't want to come home so he 'll be here in November for three weeks holidays <*> plus sign </*> then back out. \n Mickey and me finished on amicable terms - just to put your mind at rest!! And he said if I ever wanted to go back out just to say the word - so fear not! But seriously, I just don't fancy him in any way anymore, tis well weird - that I was sooo into him <*> plus sign </*> now just can't imagine going out with him at all. I think maybe it was so wonderful before I left just because he was such a babe. I totally fancied him of course <*> plus sign </*> it was a brilliant way to not get stressed during finals - how relaxed was I? That sounds really cruel but the more I think about it the more spot-on it seems. Plus the fact that he treated me really well <*> plus sign </*> we had nice romantic walks in the park <*> plus sign </*> dinners <*> plus sign </*> just messed about together all day, every day. But when it boils down to it, we never had very much in common. You know? \n Sorry to blabber on Vivian but it 's helping me get my ideas straight in my own head too - poor you! \n As for Kevin - he 's very cool <*> plus sign </*> I like him a whole heap. We told each other we loved each other in Ba&~nos after only being together a few days - but not as in \"in love\" but just like when you meet someone <*> plus sign </*> get on like a house on fire <*> plus sign </*> you feel really excited about getting to know each other better - it could be a friend you know what I mean? I was very self-controlled <*> plus sign </*> nothing much went on because of Michael, but it was very intense <*> plus sign </*> brilliant <*> plus sign </*> we 've spoken on the phone quite often since I got back <*> plus sign </*> emails every day. He 's going to try <*> plus sign </*> come over for my b'day in November, but he 's having huge money problems at the moment. So I 'm trying not to get my hopes up about it happening. One way or another, he 's coming to Cuba in January for definite so at worst we 'll see each other there. I 'm extending my flight for 10 days after the cycling trip is over to travel a bit, avec B. I figure there 's no point in going all that way and not seeing a bit more of the place. Chance of a lifetime <*> plus sign </*> all that. I 'll be getting a loan from the good old Northern Bank to pay for it. Can't wait, can't wait, can't wait!!! God I love travelling. <&Spanish> Que mas? </&Spanish> Oh yeah, Caoimhe <*> plus sign </*> me are doing a Reiki course in Derry all day tomorrow. It 's chinese energy healing -    channelling   the heat <*> plus sign </*> energy from your body, laying on of hands (!) - type-thing. It should be interesting, a giggle if nothing else. Caoimhe 's in great form. She 's working in Toomey 's at the weekends so we 've been having a good time together for the last few weeks. It 's good to have someone around to chat to. Otherwise I 'd have cracked up ages ago in the house. \n I haven't been speaking to Rosbeg since I came home but her uncle died last week. She 's still in Galway. I don't know what her plans are. Janet 's (the australian girl I met in Ecuador) coming home this weekend - she lives in Dublin. Can't wait to see her, she 's very cool. \n I 'm applying for my provisional driving license at the minute.  Supposedly  I 'm going to learn to drive - that 's the plan anyway. I 'm dying to get my test done and all that but realistically it 'll take months to get myself organised. \n Right dear, I 'll have to go now cause I 've a few things to do before I go to work. I hope I haven't bored you silly with my ramblings. \n Thanks a million for phoning <*> plus sign </*> call again if you get the chance or write or email, whatever. Say hi to everyone else.

{"text": "<Student - Friend>\n\n\n<$A>\n Kevin O'Neill <*> hash sign </*> 24, Beacon Crt. 61 Hill St.\nPerth W.A. 6000 Australia \n Dear Ben, Hi Ben I thought I 'd write about this time of the year so as to give you a refreshing break from the turgid pile of exam papers that must be adorning your desk about now. As the recent request for a reference lets you know I have eventually found a job. As is my style I seem to have    discovered   the new frontier just as it has finished squandering    its   wealth and is    slipping   into a 70's style Irish recession. Over the last three months I have applied for the few jobs on offer but my visa restricted me a great deal. At one point I had a locum position but the funding was withdrawn \u00d0 does that sound familiar? However it never dribbles but it pisses out of the heavens as they say in Dublin, once the first offer came through it was followed by six more in the next four days! My only guess is that next    year 's   budgets have just been cleared and can only    accommodate   temporary positions. The job I 've accepted is for three months and as you can see from the letter from the Royal Perth Hospital will be a challenge and a learning experience.\n I 'm still looking into studying medicine in the States or indeed here. Things look good here if I can become a resident, then it will not cost me anything and I may be eligible for grants. So I 'm applying for a permanent visa at the moment. The chances are that I 'll have to return to Ireland in the Autumn to apply to the embassy there as the law has recently been changed making it difficult to apply from here. Experience in a hospital setting will be a great advantage in any interviews I may have to do. I think I need to accumulate as many accountable factors in my favor, as for whatever reasons my college academic performance most probably will not be good enough on    its   own. In autumn I am going to sit the American College Admissions Test but for    now   I need to get a copy of \"my transcript\" \u00d0 I 'm hoping you know what that is. I 've enclosed a paragraph referring to it in the hope you may enlighten me. I have copies of my course format \u00d0 lecture and clinical hours. I also need a copy of a transcript of my academic results while in college, perhaps this is what they mean? I would appreciate if you could find the time to send whatever it is you think they want and my academic record. Thanks. \n So far my travels have been a great experience, eating an unusual ethnic fruit in    Singapore 's   China Town that was as close as I 've come to cannabalism since living in Rooms in college; searching the Out-Back for half the night on horse back for my older brother whose sense of direction was directly proportional to the    horses 's   IQ and this horse was no Mr. Edd and the stories could go on. The weather is fabulous and the beaches    superb   so while the summer lasted things were quite leisurely. Now you 'll be pleased to know the weather has turned, it was a cool 26 <*> degrees sign </*> C today. In September we are going to tour the country and    Thailand   if money and plans work out. I 'll send you a post card from somewhere along the trail. Until then I hope you and your family have a good summer. \n Thanks for your help.\nYours sincerely Kevin O'Neill \n Excuse the typing but I seem to have a blind    typewriter.  \n\n\n<$B>\n Tues/snowing/ugh \n Liz! A few hours ago I spoke to Irene \u00d0 she told me 'sorta' all <*> ampersand </*> no doubt she told me you my all, I think    it 's   just the AGE! You can only adjust to so much <*> ampersand </*> then it goes. She 'll be OK \u00d0 it sounds to me. I was trying to get her defer this year at college \u00d0 perhaps. Her trouble is she refuses to go into depth if you know what I mean. Just put her head down <*> ampersand </*> goes for it all the time closing down her parameters. \n Sometimes I feel as if I could sit there write the script, hand it to her <*> ampersand </*> she 'd laugh <*> ampersand </*> cry at the right intervals <*> ampersand </*>    that 's   called social exchange <*> ampersand </*> I have suspected for a long time she does it to herself <*> ampersand </*> Jim <*> ampersand </*> children as well. \n Anyway she knows where I am and I 'm sane <*> ampersand </*> normal since I managed to persuade doctors their job is not just to give me antibiotics <*> ampersand </*> beta blockers (neither of which I take). I 've been there, bought the tee shirt, read the book, bought the CD, seen the video et al. \n Madness (not real serious stuff. N. breakdowns) seem to be coming out of the woodwork at the moment. Spent all yesterday trying to get a friend sectioned to the bin who thinks Putney is a suburb of Russia <*> ampersand </*> she 's married to a guy from Star Wars boy was that a boring film. \n    What 's   wrong with Stephen Rea \u00d0 I 'd eat him for breakfast \u00d0 know people who know him but decided I couldn't wangle an invite as I might    salivate   at the table just that bit too much. \n Well    what 's   new! Well me for one \u00d0 back in the land of the living. HRT \u00d0 I    heartily   recommend horse piss. Great stuff. 3 days <*> ampersand </*>    you 're   human again. Had all the allergy tests pollen/trees/cats/horses <*> ampersand </*> guinea pigs? But not I 'm allergic too vastly to any. No    polyps   in nasal passages/teeth can't cause it (sinus problems that is \u00d0 drove me mad! Did I tell you, the Pain was out of this world, anyway HEAD scan Monday. So perhaps apart from being a batty middleage woman I might have cause for it. Only taken me 20 years to get them to react. \n Have to go for a piss \u00d0 sit quietly <*> ampersand </*> wait for my return. \n Back    that 's   better. Anyway I hear    you're   to be Jewish.    It 's   not fair \u00d0 how dare you steal my thunder? I 'm only 1/4 Jewish    Father 's   Ma \u00d0 but she was Australian. So that gets me a few points up for obscurity. Ya boo sucks to you! \n    How 's   Nancy. Wrote her a letter but haven't heard back \n As you will see from the address have decamped to Putney <*> ampersand </*> am ipso-facto living with Rodney. Only took me 20 years. - Always    veered   on the side of caution <*> ampersand </*> to think my    mother 's   sexual advice was just  'make sure he 's clean'  \u00d0 she never told me in what context. For years I insisted they had a bath first. \n Knew on Monday this week should never have happen! Yesterday lurched from worse to worse. Today got a letter to say Pat    O'Rafferty 's   Da had died <*> ampersand </*> his new (? was she even new) Fanny on the side is sitting round    Angela 's   house (the woman  he  won't let go) saying she 's Fanny No2 3 months pregnant (which she 's not) <*> ampersand </*> a    family   friend has OD-ed at the kitchen table on purpose (how do they know?) and the rest of the world -! at least I don't feel anymore that I 'm the only one who does it. \n    Agoraphobia   gone \u00d0    how 's   yours. Don't know when. I think I realise nothing worse could happen. So there was no point to be scared. I get on <*> ampersand </*> off buses trains /    planes   walk down streets without a qualm. \n Let she without qualms cast the first stone. \n Do write <*> ampersand </*> tell the sister too. AT ONCE. \n love Frankie xxx \n P.S. Hannah <*> ampersand </*> I were having a mega row last time I was over <*> ampersand </*> she was reading a book (mcbrinns read books as they row.) <*> ampersand </*> she said listen to this, it was old household one \u00d0 ie  \"There are 3 stages to the common house fly etc. but the last is when they have blue    veins   in their wings\"  \u00d0 have we attained the blue    veins?   \n A passing thought. \n Sorry if missed gaps in letter but this  <-> seem <->  seems   to happen at such a speed <*> ampersand </*> within different groups you forget, who knows what who when <*> ampersand </*>    where.   \n In my usual fashion after writing letter lost it \u00d0 now found again. \n Spoke to Irene yesterday \u00d0 sounds a lot more confident <*> ampersand </*> doing some kind of cleaning job in the evenings \u00d0 sounds vile \u00d0 but then if    it 's   unpleasant Irene will find a virtue in it.

{"text": "<Aran Islands>\n\n\n<W1B>-014$A>\n Friday \n Hi Muriel, How are you faring with the pigs? Thanks a million for your letter \u00d0 I got it when I came back from Inis M&/or on Wednesday. I 'm sorry that I didn't send any postcards but I couldn't see any post box on the island. I went there with Neasa from work \u00d0 the girl who wanted to go to the IRMA awards, remember? Oh Muriel, she is    definitely   not on my wavelength. Maeve was supposed to go with me but because she didn't have a job she couldn't so Neasa said she 'd come. She 's very quiet <*> agus sign </*> after a while I just had nothing to say to her; I mean I couldn't think of anything at all. We got the bus to Galway <*> agus sign </*> then we got a bus to Inverin in Connemara where the airport is <*> agus sign </*> we flew out in a plane that holds 10 people including the pilot <*> agus sign </*> is very confined! It only takes around 10 minutes to fly but if it 's very windy the flight is very very bumpy. There we got a bus to Kilronan <*> agus sign </*> went to our B <*> agus sign </*> B \u00d0 Bay View (how original!) It was lovely, right on the sea with The American Bar of Waterboys fame just around the corner. We got the whole package for <*> pound sign </*> 60 (1 night 's B <*> agus sign </*> B, so we had like 24 hours on the island). The first night (Tuesday), we went for a walk around <*> agus sign </*> looked at the craft shops \u00d0 they have no tacky crap at all, thank God. Then the heavens opened <*> agus sign </*> we were practically drowned (no exaggeration \u00d0 it was pouring!) <*> agus sign </*> of course the only other clothes I had brought was my pyjamas <*> agus sign </*> a pair of shorts! So I spent the rest of the night going round in green checky shorts <*> agus sign </*> a flowery tee shirt from my pyjamas! As least I didn't meet anyone who knew me! We went to the fast food place for something to eat \u00d0 it was nice at the time but I felt sick after around an hour. We then proceeded to the American Bar where we drank    Guinness   (me bottles <*> agus sign </*> Neasa pints) from 1/2 8 until quarter to one. It was too wet to go walking anywhere so we stayed put. I really enjoyed the pub because we met lots of people. The place was crawling with tourists \u00d0 nearly all of them tanned European couples that would make you sick with envy <*> agus sign </*> yearning! The natives are kind of reserved or something <*> agus sign </*> I felt a bit like an intruder but if you spoke Irish to them they were slightly more friendly because then at least they knew you were Irish. \n The first person we met in the pub was this guy from Mayo who was a fisherman (he was around 30, I think <*> agus sign </*> told us that he had been a sparring partner for Barry McGuigan <*> agus sign </*> how his mother had died when he was 16. He was kind of merry so you wouldn't know whether to believe his or not. He looked a bit like Des from Glenroe. We met him again the next day <*> agus sign </*> he was still in the pub, god help us! Then we met this family from Longford who were staying in The Mainistir Hostel on the road up to D&/un Aengus. It had gotten a great review in the Sunday Independent by this man <*> agus sign </*> his wife who have published books about good places to eat <*> agus sign </*> stay around Ireland but these people thought that it was so bad that they left the next morning on the ferry at 10.30 <*> agus sign </*> they didn't have to pay for their    accommodation   or anything. Then we met Nigel <*> agus sign </*> Tom (or it could have been Todd, I 'm not too sure) <*> agus sign </*> they were working on some building that was going on at the time. They were really nice guys. Nigel was 22 <*> agus sign </*> had been going out with his girlfriend for 12 years (can you imagine?) but he wasn't in love with her. They grew up together <*> agus sign </*> it seemed to be expected that they go out with each other \u00d0 pathetic isn't it? Then Todd or Tom told us how he had been going out with a girl for 9 months <*> agus sign </*> when he came back from being away working, she was going out with his best friend. They thought anyway that we 'd find the right person without any problem <*> agus sign </*> that they 'd be flattered if a girl asked them out (?) <*> agus sign </*> that it was just as hard for a guy to ask a girl out as vice versa. They walked back to the B <*> agus sign </*> B with us (even though it was just around the corner) and were just really nice. \n Then the next day was beautiful <*> agus sign </*> sunny with an incredible wind from the sea \u00d0 it was so clean. The night before I opened the window going to bed <*> agus sign </*> you could hear the tide coming in which was wonderful. We rented bikes <*> agus sign </*> the plan was we 'd cycle up to D&/un Aengus 8 km away. It 's uphill all the way <*> agus sign </*> we were 3/4 of the way there when Neasa decided she wanted to go back so I said that that was fine, but that I was going to keep going so she said she 'd come <*> agus sign </*> we hadn't gone on for 10 minutes when it started to drizzle <*> agus sign </*> we turned back <*> agus sign </*> came back into Kilronan. After lunch I said I was going to go up there on one of the buses so we headed off again. We met Tom Mullane <*> agus sign </*> his pony Polly <*> agus sign </*> his trap with reflectors on the back of it. Oh Muriel he was so cute you 'd just run away with him! We had to walk around 20 minutes up to Dun Aengus which is around 300 ft above sea level. It was built by the Fir Bolg, I think <*> agus sign </*> is basically at the edge of the world. It was so beautiful up there that it just defies description. I took loads of photos up there so I 'll have them when you come down. On our way back down to the bus, I was (as my mother would say!) looking one way <*> agus sign </*> going the other when I fell. It 's really rocky there <*> agus sign </*> I think I must have broken my leg (only joking!) Seriously though, I think I bruised the bone because it swelled around the place where it got cut <*> agus sign </*> there 's a huge bruise that 's really sore. But I don't care because it was worth it. There are 850 people living there, 6 pubs, 3 national schools <*> agus sign </*> 1 technical school. I 'm definitely going back but the next time I 'll stay for at least a week. I 'd love to live there but I suppose that 's out of the question in terms of a job etc \u00d0 bloody typical. \n I saw the Fisher King again on Sunday, it 's so good isn't it? We got Hamlet last night but only watched half of it because we got it at around 10 o'clock <*> agus sign </*> it 's kind of difficult to watch if you are tired. Yesterday I went out to the art gallery in Blennerville; Maeve got a few hours there for 2 weeks, in the mornings <*> agus sign </*> she 's working afternoons for the festival. I bought a gorgeous red scarf/shawl there <*> agus sign </*> I think my mother thought I 'd lost the head altogether because I looked like Caitl&/in N&/i; Houlihan going around with my long pleated grey skirt, white cotton top and red shawl. \n I 'm going up to Spiddal on the 21st I think \u00d0 it 's today week anyway. I 'm going to see Fionnuala Murphy. I 'm going Friday and coming home Sunday. She 's working in Col&/aiste U&/i Chadhaill <*> agus sign </*> has weekends off so I said I 'd go up. You 'd never know, I might bump into Glen Dunne, I think he lives in Spiddal now. I can't wait to go up <*> agus sign </*> hopefully it 'll be good craic. \n Are you coming down so, the week of the festival? Please do Muriel because Ali 's going away on the 25th <*> agus sign </*> you can have her room <*> agus sign </*> we 'll have the place to ourselves for a day or two anyway. There is nothing on for the festival only a c&/eil&/i in the square <*> agus sign </*> I think there 's a classical music thing on too but I 'll find out about that. Would you like to go to Dingle for a day? The bus is <*> pound sign </*> 4 return I think <*> agus sign </*> we could go to see Fungi an all. Let me know next letter ok? \n<> I know what you mean about Bryan Ferry. He 's such a change from those pigs <*> agus sign </*> that cook needs a good kick up the rear end. What kind of things does she make? I hate that kind of shit; it 's so superficial, isn't it? As for Dr. Tony \u00d0 is that an honorary doctorate? He 'd hardly have the brains to work for one, would he? \n I hope Pat Dunphy gets on ok in Dublin <*> agus sign </*> that she doesn't strangle Catherine \u00d0 she sounds like a frightful wanker altogether. That dinner ye had sounds divine. Your plans for the /s/ /&^s/ are great altogether \u00d0 it must be difficult for him to do it though, you know, focusing on something that must be embarrassing for him but it 's hard for you too if he 's accusing you of picking holes. Anyway, I think it 's great experience for you. I 've just thought \u00d0 what are you going to do for your clinic? And have you any idea when the term starts in October? I hope it 's not until the 12th \u00d0 that would be great because I could take a week off work before going back. I 'm looking forward to going back but not to study \u00d0 the same story as last year! \n Muckross is gorgeous isn't it? Did you see the    enormous dining table there? I just love it but I hate that room with all the stuffed animals \u00d0 talk about gross. The scenery around Killarney is amazing isn't it? I hope the day was clear because you 'd see nothing with the fog. Kenmare is lovely isn't it? The church is in a lovely place <*> agus sign </*> there 's a gorgeous celtic high cross there <*> agus sign </*> lovely craft shops. Where did ye eat? We went to the Coachman 's Inn, I think, on our way back from Bantry. What did you have to eat. I had a letter from Aoife yesterday \u00d0 she seemed in good enough form. I must ask her what happened about the job in the shop from last year. \n The Little green riding hood \u00d0 the T-shirt was the one that you were giving to the Vincent de Paul remember? it 's green with kind of wine <*> agus sign </*> dark mustardy pattern, short sleeves <*> agus sign </*> a plain green hoodie thing.. <*> agus sign </*> Aoife kept a white one with a collar <*> agus sign </*> an orange one. Oh the poem \u00d0 I just love it \u00d0 it 's by D.H. Lawrence. As for the tooth, well at the moment it 's firmly in place <*> agus sign </*> hopefully it 'll stay that way. \n I just remembered that last week on day when we were going up to the warehouse in the van <*> agus sign </*> I nearly fainted. I got such a fright <*> agus sign </*> it took a good few minutes before I could breathe properly. The bitch would not let me sit on her lap so myself Kate <*> agus sign </*> Benedict asked Se&/an, the production manager who is brain dead by the way! to give us a lift up in his car. It took nearly an hour <*> agus sign </*> a half for me to recover; my hands were shaking, my legs were like jelly <*> agus sign </*> I thought I 'd throw up. Everybody except that beached whale asked me was I alright. Talk about ignorant! Benedict was so nice to me, God he 's lovely <*> agus sign </*> when we were going home in the evening he made a big fuss trying to squash in next to her <*> agus sign </*> suggested that he sit in her lap \u00d0 it was priceless! \n I 'm sorry that I wasn't there when you rang, but thank you for calling \u00d0 I hope my mother didn't keep you talking all night! As for putting on 1/2 a stone \u00d0 Muriel don't worry about it \u00d0 my mother <*> agus sign </*> Ali are forever telling me that I have an enormous appetite <*> agus sign </*> that they can't get over how much I eat \u00d0 they 'll give me a complex about it at the rate they 're going. We threw away our weighing scales <*> agus sign </*> didn't bother to get a new one so I 'm trying to convince myself that I haven't put on any weight but when I 'm working, I go for coffee <*> agus sign </*> a bar or 2 of chocolate at my break (everyday!) which is a very bad idea. I 'll have to control myself! \n Oh yes, Fionnuala B 's birthday is on September 17 \u00d0 what will we do? I haven't written to her at all yet, I 'd better drop her a line I suppose! I still have to write to Aoife <*> agus sign </*> Audrey so I 'd better go now or I 'll be at this all day! How did Pat Keating get on at the hospital \u00d0 is she ok? Tell her I said \"hi\" <*> agus sign </*> give her a hug from me. \n Let me know when you 're coming \u00d0 I 'm dying to see you.\nLoads of love <*> agus sign </*> hugs <*> agus sign </*> kisses, Sarah Jane xxxxxxxxxxxx", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6a608661-796f-4ca6-9d0b-d338214592d6", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.546338+00:00"}
{"text": "<London letters>\n\n\n<$A>\n London 3/12/93 \n Dear Jennifer, I hope you are all well? Here we are again the end of another year! What have you been doing since I saw you. I had a nice time dawdling around with you for the day. I really miss those kind of times. \n    How 's   Dan? Say hello. Well, I 'm coming up to the end of the second term on the course <*> ampersand </*> I 'm exhausted. I 'm really glad I did it, but    there 's   been no room for anything else. Today I literally came up for air and have been thinking thinking thinking like bloody Spancil Hill, in fact.    How 's   Brdiget (Kirwan)? Give her my best. I hope all is well with her? and Desmond. I haven't seen very much of Suzi;    she 's   fighting the usual fights the 40's are not a pretty sight/time/state/etc. \n    How 's   Maire? She 's lovely Jen, I hope she is happy.    She 's   like one of my own, for obvious reasons. How 's the baby. Bob went home for a few days with his friend close the gate, as we call him. (Gath is the chap 's name). He 's huge big guy from Jordan. Big, like an old fashioned Garda Siochana. He cracks his head <*> ampersand </*> has had more stitches on his head than you can believe. Bob wanted to see Se&/an, he likes Kevin, but he got involved with the hooha <*> ampersand </*> didn't know where to go.    He 's   ok in London <*> ampersand </*> is fairly street wise here, no mean feat. It takes courage to take on London. You think Dublin is a hoor of a city! \n I don't think I 'll be going to college next year, although I 'll try, for the challenge. I always run away from interviews <*> ampersand </*> forms etc. The give me the horrors <*> ampersand </*> insomnia. \n    How 's   Abbey?    She 's   very like Dan at the same time    there 's   a bit of her reminds me of Robin especially when she starts to smile. \n    Fred 's   applying for jobs overseas as    there 's   no permanent jobs here, at all. The cold wind of cut-backs is howling into all the hospitals <*> ampersand </*>    universities   <*> ampersand </*> they are cutting grants. London is great if you are studying or learning, but otherwise it would be very hard to stay here. I don't fancy being a cranky old bag with me shopping trolley here. Bob is the only one at home now <*> ampersand </*>    he 's   off to college next autumn. So, if a job comes up next year we will probably take it. At least I can't really hang around waiting for Godot! I suppose I 'm very arrogant really I won't accept people or situations telling me this far I can go and no further. However sometimes I wish I was half thick <*> ampersand </*> didn't give a shit. \n    How 's   Timmy are things any better?    It 's   very worrying when you can't do anything about what you see. \n I 'm trying to grow out of the last stage. I 've had to look at myself rather closely having gone back to painting, it was always a place that made me look inwards once a convent school girl always one! However if you find a lot of shit on your door step,    it 's   impossible to pretend    it 's   not there. \n One positive thing I 've lost a stone weight since I saw you last. \n I hope to come over for a long weekend in the next few weeks but I don't know when. If I do I will give you a ring. Give my love to all the kids (adults now! I hate clocks) I often think of you and have talks with you - I 'm remembering your Aunt with the sweeping brush. \nLove Eileen xxx \n\n\n<$A>\n19th April '94\n Dear Jen, Just thought I would drop you a line to say hello. How are you keeping?    How 's   Dan and Abbey? Thanks for the phone call    it 's   always like a bombshell from another dimension! \n    It 's   a lovely day here and I seem to have landed in the kitchen at the table, with the house empty after a year of activity. Things always come to an end. I 'm waiting for an interview in two weeks time for Wimbledon, I 'm going to become a middleaged Womble. If not I 'll get a job (if any!) <*> ampersand </*> paint. In some ways I 'd rather do that anyhow. \n When are you coming over to London? I might try and get to Dublin over the next 2 months. I went out to ring Suzy,    she 's   in a bit of a down phase at the moment. She said her sister was coming over today to see her. \n    How 's   Nora? And    how 's   Bridget?    How 's   Maire and the baby? Give her my love. Tommy often speaks of her. \n    He 's   back at school on Monday. This will be his last term at school! The end of an era!    He 's   either getting a job in London for the summer or going over to Ronan to work in Dublin.    He 's   into music <*> ampersand </*> needs money for lessons. \n The winter has only ended this week.    It 's   been very cold and wet. I went over to Paris for a week with Fred and stayed in Nora 's room while she was over here, gas lot my family. We walked everywhere <*> ampersand </*> visited the Louvre etc. It was very cold <*> ampersand </*> rained incessantly there was a transport strike on also although it didn't affect us at all. It was nice to get out of London for a bit. \n    How 's   Robin <*> ampersand </*> Timmy? Did you decide to do some more about the calligraphy? \n    Nora 's   flat is in the Jewish quarter over a synagogue.    It 's   really safe there.    It 's   medieval Paris. I love it there, nobody bothers anybody, she says she loves it. It was very emotional walking into her empty room. All the bits <*> ampersand </*> pieces; I felt like a voyeur! Strange conflict of emotions. \n How 's Dan? Say hello. I hope you 'll come <*> ampersand </*> see us when you 're over, if you can that is. Life is never convenient, is it. \n Angela is in Spain. I 've just written to her. Ronan is thinking of going to Canada, a family of wanderers, I have. \n Are you reading anything interesting? I owe the library (plural) a fortune in late return fines. They are mainly art books <*> ampersand </*> seem to be impossible to finish. \n Well. I will stop now Jen, I hope to see you soon there or here. Keep in touch. \n Love Eileen xx \n\n\n<$A>\nSaturday\n Dear Jen, Thanks for your letter. It was a welcome event here in London! It 's Saturday afternoon and the weather has changed for the better.\n I hope you are OK? and that your mind is at rest about your lump. I understand    it 's   to your advantage that you fed all the babies yourself. Let 's know,    it 's   indeed a real thing to worry about. So don't be too hard on yourself. \n I 'm not a very exciting letter writer. I have to get into the 'flow' hence miles of verbiage.! \n How 's Jane Kelly? tell her I said hello. I 'm coming to the end of my book - I 've been reading it for nearly a year <*> ampersand </*> I will miss it when I 'm finished it. I hate finishing books, my routine changes. \n I 've been cleaning the flat since I got back! But I have quite enjoyed it, strange as it may seem. I 'm also back at work in my office block, 5-7pm every evening. Unfortunately my left hand/working hand is very painful. I 'm afraid of losing the use of my hands! \n I miss Wednesdays <*> ampersand </*> Fridays! However, for some reason you <*> ampersand </*> Dublin don't seem so far away any more! <*> ampersand </*> I don't feel so isolated as I did before last year! Since when is our perception of distance a state of mind! London is a stressful place, but I don't seem to have the awful fears any more! I immediately spot <*> ampersand </*> secure! Zap! \n Fred is glad I 'm back, I think , he was feeling lonely <*> ampersand </*> depressed. Nora is coming around tomorrow, she now has the chest infection <*> ampersand </*> Fred has just recovered from it. I think    it 's   pollution <*> ampersand </*> people knocking half the street down with the resulting shite landing on us! \n Angela is working away <*> ampersand </*> got us two tickets to a concert, where she works - a blues player <*> ampersand </*> band called Buddy Guy. She 's fine <*> ampersand </*> seems more happy in herself, although she 'd ate the arse off you in the most mercurial way for the most unlikely <*> ampersand </*> bizarre reasons - like I can't describe! She 's all right though <*> ampersand </*> we have a few laughs sometimes. \n Ronan rings up the odd time <*> ampersand </*> seems ok. He says the new job is probably going to be a sweet-shop, but it might be good for him. Everything seems to be ok in Clonskeagh, so much for the \"control factor/freak\"! \n I 've just woken up from a glass of wine induced snooze I can't drink any more either. I 'm glad you 're getting more friendly with Riona. I rather liked her too. Did she mention M&/air&/in Gallagher (how do you spell her name?) \n    What 's   the news with Timmy 's school? I hope Rathmines fares out better.    It 's   gas, fucking gas, I should say - schools everywhere, bursting with professional educators, bursting to educate <*> ampersand </*> a little young fellow in 'need' of a big, finds nought but a  drought!  Rathmines, Angela says, was very nice <*> ampersand </*> she much preferred it to everywhere else she went. It cost me a mild fortune to find that out! \n Are the lassies still not speaking?    It 's   strange how the world sees our babies; mutually so, I might add, as adults.    That 's   not a very good sentence. I hope you know what I mean <*> ampersand </*> do I have to add fear of illiteracy to my list (I ask myself fearfully) of fears! \n Tommy has just finished his exams and is exhausted, has gone out to meet his friends and get drunk.    He 's   , fortunately, got a job for the summer, in    Fred 's   hospital on the computers. I 'm so glad, as he will be busy <*> ampersand </*> not too broke! \n I think I will stop now as I need some tea, pause! xx \n Hello there old friend!    It 's   Monday morning <*> ampersand </*> I 'm preparing to face going into college on Thursday, to work in the final    years '   show. The nerves; the nerves! I have done it before! I rang <*> ampersand </*> organized it! I 'm a    practising   painter! -3 secure thoughts. Well    that 's   that for the moment. \n Nora came around yesterday she 's ill <*> ampersand </*> we had such a nice time. Her <*> ampersand </*> her chaps are grating off each other at the moment. Following your advice I nod knowingly <*> ampersand </*> say nothing, just look encouraging. Since I haven't a clue anyhow,    there 's   shag all else I can do anyhow. I 've kind of distanced myself from them in the sense of the total responsibility in favour of respecting not only their independence but also my own <*> ampersand </*> I don't feel guilt ridden! Hurray! \n I hope    Dan 's   well and Marymount is not eating him alive, all jobs are alive <*> ampersand </*> hungry! \n Give Abbey a kiss for me. I miss her stories - including the    eponymous   (nice word, what does it mean? Ask her <*> ampersand </*> is it spelt right?) slugs. My small dictionary (from 2 year school) has Epoch, Epode -  \"the third <*> ampersand </*> last part of an ode\"  then Equable! So I don't know. \n > How are the little    ones '   ears noses <*> ampersand </*> tonsils - all the little pink <*> ampersand </*> vulnerable parts we mind <*> ampersand </*> worry <*> ampersand </*> cure. Give my love to the girls. \n I haven't finished my book. I walked back to Nottinghill with Nora and Fred last night <*> ampersand </*> had a cup of tea <*> ampersand </*> had a chat <*> ampersand </*> then walked back again - she had left her antibiotics on the chair, so her chap kindly cycled back, there, here <*> ampersand </*> then back there for them, with them. Oh tit-willow! Oh what grand deeds and earth-shattering life acts I    envisaged   when I looked up words in my incomplete dictionary. The imperfections reveal more truth and humour and life than anything else. What an earth-shattering discovery. \n Well I will stop bolloxing on now <*> ampersand </*> go <*> ampersand </*> buy some milk for the Weetabix and tea. Letter writing is very thirst-inducing. I 'm afraid the word frugal doesn't apply to my writing, verbose the full palate maybe. \n I will post this on my way back from the shop. So I hope all goes well for you today Jen. \n Your loving friend Eileen xxx", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "b9d56bd2-36bb-4428-926e-98827fbb54be", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.547213+00:00"}

As you know, the original application closedate was 30 April 1994. \n Due to an unprecedented response to this plan - and a desire on our part to make this protection available to as many First Trust Bank visa cardholders as possible - we have asked Avon Insurance PLC to extend the application closedate to Tuesday, 10 May 1994. \n Another provisions of cover outline has been supplied so that you may conveniently review the many advantages of this important cover. \n Of course, the <*> pound sign </*> 1,000 no-cost accidental death insurance is being provided by First Trust Bank for 10 full years as a service to you and our other cardholders. There is no obligation on your part. But we also suggest that you seriously consider the low-cost optional cover, available in amounts up to <*> pound sign </*> 60,000. Acceptance under this plan is guaranteed for all cardholders aged 17 or above and under 70 ... there are no health questions and no medical examination is required. \n If you wish to apply, simply complete the enclosed application form and return it in the pre-paid envelope provided. You need send no money. (If you elect additional cover, your monthly premium will be charged automatically to your First Trust Bank visa account each month.) \n But remember, to receive your <*> pound sign </*> 1,000 of no-cost cover, you must return your application form by 10 May 1994. \n C F Miller Manager Card <*> ampersand </*> Retailer Services \n\n\n<$B>\n Dear Dr Deane \n   RE : PERMISSION FOR VIDEOCONFERENCING VIDEO   \n A joint initiative between Audio Visual Services and the Institute of Computer Based Learning is currently being undertaken for the production of a video on videoconferencing, in    liaison   with the Videoconferencing Development Officer. \n This short programme will illustrate a range of examples of the use of videoconferencing in both teaching and research at Queen 's and current users of the technology will address the issues involved and outline how it has benefited them. \n At this point, the initiative requires your input in three ways: 1. Permission to film your videoconference class to Armagh on  Thursday 15th May  2. Recommend a student to interview from your class to gain their experiences as an end-user of videoconferencing technology on  Thursday 15th May  3. A personal interview to explore the videoconferencing issues through your experience with the technology on  Wednesday 28th May  \n As you are aware, exams are looming and therefore teaching of classes draws to a close at the end of May for most courses. Therefore, it would be appreciated if you could facilitate the above and fill-in and return the slip attached, in order that the necessary video footage can take place, with minimal disruption to your work. \n Yours sincerely Seamus Carlin <italic> Videoconferencing Development Officer </italic> \n 1.

It was agreed that whilst bullying was not an Equal Opportunities issue to be dealt with under the provisions of the Equal opportunities complaints procedure, nonetheless it was an issue which needed to be addressed by the University. \n Accordingly I wish to advise you of the following: 1. The university does not condone bullying at work be it by managers towards employees or employees towards fellow employees. Those who engage in bullying behaviour will be subject to the University 's disciplinary code. 2. It is a management responsibility to do everything reasonably practical to ensure bullying does not occur and that when it does, it is dealt with robustly to make sure there is no recurrence. \n Please ensure that this letter is drawn to the attention of your staff. Yours sincerely Paul Browne For Harry McConnell Director of Human Resources \n\n\n<$D>\n September 17, 1999 \n Dear Fred As you know, I 'm busy finding my feet as Writer in Residence here. At the moment I 'm just trying to sort out my office and start setting up the classes. To that end, I had a wee word with Colette in the office, and she suggested that you were the man to talk to. \n So, a couple of quick things. Firstly, there 's an elderly computer and typewriter gathering dust in the office. I know there 's a new PC on the way for me, so I was wondering what I should do with the old stuff. Can you let me know? I understand there 's some sort of storage facility somewhere in the University. \n Secondly, and more urgently, I 'd like to book a room. I 'm going to be running two classes this semester - 'An Introduction to Creative Writing' and the ongoing 'Queen 's Writers ' Group'. Both will take place on Wednesday afternoons. We 'll be getting cracking from Wednesday, October 6. 'Introduction' will start at 3 pm and run through to 4, and then the Writers ' Group will go from 4 to 6. I 'll be expecting fairly large numbers, for the first few weeks at least. I 'm advised - by current members of the Group - that the back room of House 3 is the most suitable. So I 'd like to book that room from 3-6 each Wednesday from Oct. 6. I hope that 's OK. \n Please give me a call to confirm details. The extension number is 2915, and my home number 563461. Let 's get together and have a coffee and a chat. I do want to be proactive as Writer in Residence - a real member of the team - so do stay in touch and keep me informed about anything you think I should know about, or anywhere I can help out. \n So, all the best, Fred, and see you soon.

Owing to my status as a research student at UU, my hourly rate of pay from this teaching is <*> pound sign </*> 14. My income from UU combined with my weekly income from Queen 's is less than the sum of money that I can receive from social security benefits. For this reason, I must forego my semester one teaching in the school, in order that I may claim these benefits. \n I apologise for any inconvenience that this decision may cause. I am also very grateful to Jane Hegarty and Mark Maxwell for their efforts in securing semester one teaching for me. \n Very best wishes, Michelle Horgan \n\n\n<$F>\n 28 June 1994 \n Dear Dr Smith-O'Dwyer \n <italic> Presentation to Directors of Schools/Heads of Units on Thursday 16 and Friday 17 June 1994 </italic> \n Thank you for sending your nominee to the presentation on Thursday 16 June 1994. I trust he/she found it worthwhile and has had an opportunity to appraise you of its contents. \n The focus of the presentation was to introduce the concept of delegating, within specified parameters, the authority to sign purchase orders at School/Unit level. The success of this delegated authority rests on the nomination of staff (one or possibly two from each School/Unit) who would act as an extension of the Purchasing Office by personally signing orders and posting them directly to suppliers. As the 'nominated buyer' will be acting on behalf of the Purchasing Office, it is necessary that there is an agreement between the Director of School/Head of Unit and this office as to the identity of your nominee(s). I should be grateful, therefore, if you could forward this information to the Purchasing Office as soon as possible. \n It is hoped that your proposals will be acceptable. However, in the event that the Purchasing Office is not in agreement, I will contact you personally. For your convenience, I have attached a reply form for you to complete. \n Should you have any queries regarding the above, or indeed any purchasing-related matter, please do not hesitate to contact me. I have enclosed for your information copies of handouts issued during the presentations. \n Yours sincerely Lisa B Earls (Mrs) Assistant Secretary (Purchasing) enc cc Provost \n\n\n<$G>\n 5.8.94 \n Dr R.B.

Occupational stress is a complex issue but one which we believe should be addressed constructively. \n The University firstly wishes to assess the experience of occupational stress amongst its staff. The enclosed questionnaire has been widely used in a number of service industries throughout the UK and is designed to measure the sources and effects of occupational stress. The distribution, collection and assessment of the questionnaire is being administered confidentially by the University Occupational Health Service and has the support of the University Safety Committee which represents both the employer and employees in matters of occupational health and safety. \n We ask you to complete the questionnaire accurately and return it to the Occupational Health Service in the envelope provided by Friday 20 June 1997. You are not asked to identify yourself on the questionnaire but there is a small number of questions regarding staff category, grade, contract, and managerial unit. This data will be used only in the analysis of the questionnaire to ensure that we get a representative sample from all areas of University staff. The    analysis of the questionnaires will be reported to the University Safety Committee. \n Thank you for taking the time to complete this questionnaire. \n Yours sincerely PROFESSOR R McCLELLAND DR D O TODD\nChairman University Safety Committee\tOccupational Health Physician Enc \n\n\n<$J>\n MEMORANDUM \n TO: Directors of Schools/Institutes \n FROM: Colm Crean \n DATE: 01 May 1997 REF: CC/mem \n Progress of Access Students \n The Committee of Deans has asked for a report on the progress of Access students at Queen 's, i.e. all those who embarked on a course of study at Queen 's following successful completion of an Access programme under the auspices of either Queen 's or the University of Ulster. The last such exercise took place in 1995, and I enclose a copy of the report which subsequently went to Academic Council. \n I have already managed to obtain some very useful statistics from Dr Myrtle Hill, and these figures reveal the proportions of Access students who successfully complete each successive stage leading to an eventual degree. However, in addition to this I would be grateful if you could ask any of your staff with experience of teaching Access students to pass on any personal impressions they have formed. For example, the previous report suggests that while Access students might struggle or require greater individual attention in the early days, they can be highly committed and often emerge with good degrees - is this still the case? \n I hope to have a draft report prepared in time for the Entrance Requirements Sub-Committee meeting on 19 May 1997, but any responses before Wednesday, 21 May 1997 will be very welcome, in time for the Committee of Deans meeting on 29 May 1997.

{"text": "<QUB business>\n\n\n<$A>\n 01 May 1998 Dear Colleague  FAIR EMPLOYMENT (NORTHERN IRELAND) ACT 1989 (as amended)  \n You may be aware that the University is required by the above Act under the Fair Employment (Monitoring) Regulations (NI) 1989, to monitor the perceived religious affiliation or community background of both its employees and applicants for employment, in order to make an annual monitoring return to the Fair Employment Commission. \n In the past, the University has used the 'first schools ' method as its principal means of determining the community background of employees and applicants to the organisation. This process was slow, inefficient and increasingly inaccurate relying on an outdated primary schools directory produced by the Department of Economic Development. \n In February 1998, the University changed its method of monitoring to the 'direct question', asking applicants whether they belong to the Protestant community, the Roman Catholic community or neither. This had an immediate effect on the efficiency of the monitoring process. \n However, in changing the principal monitoring method, the University is required to re-survey those members of staff for whom no determination of community background has been made. Previously, employees who stated that they received their primary school education outside Northern Ireland and for whom no determination of community background was made, were included in the University 's statutory monitoring return as  'nondetermined'  and referred to within the University as  'Non Northern Ireland'  or  'XNI' . The 'Residuary Method' was not used as a method of trying to  'perceive'  the religious affiliation/community background of such employees.  \n Under the terms of the Fair Employment (Monitoring) Regulations (NI) 1989, a resurvey of staff previously categorised as  'Non Northern Ireland'  is required to ensure that their details are included in the Monitoring Return. Upon receipt of completed forms, staff taking part in this re-survey will be advised to the amended information held on the monitoring system and will be given the opportunity to correct this is required. Where information is not supplied, the Residuary Method will be used to make a determination (where possible) and staff will also be given the opportunity to amend this, if required. \n This exercise is a legal requirement placed on the University and I request your co-operation and assistance in complying with it. It should be noted that it is not envisaged that the overall profile of the University in terms of the community background of its staff will change significantly as a result of this re-survey. \n Any information you provide will be treated with the strictest levels of confidentiality and will only be used to produce statistical summaries where the identities of individuals will not appear.  The information will not be available for any purpose other than Equal Opportunities Monitoring.  \n I would be grateful if you would complete the enclosed re-survey form and return it to this office on or before  TUESDAY 12 MAY 1998.  I have enclosed a reply envelope for your convenience. \n If you have any queries about this re-survey, please do not hesitate to contact this office at extension 3039/5139 \n Thanking you in anticipation of your co-operation in this re-survey exercise. \n Yours faithfully  Paul Browne Equal Opportunities Manager Encs \n\n\n<$B>\n Equal Opportunities Unit Level 4, Administration Building To: All Colleagues From: Lynette Donnelly Monitoring Officer Date: 2 March 1998 Ref: M2-98/ld/c \n The Queen 's University of Belfast is committed to equality of opportunity for all its employees. The aim of the University 's Equal Opportunities Policy is to ensure that no person by reason of religious belief, political opinion, sex, marital status, race, colour, ethnic origin or disability is treated less favourably nor is disadvantaged for those reason by conditions or requirements which cannot be justified. \n In order to ensure that the aims of this policy are achieved, the Unit needs you assistance as it is essential that the monitoring information held is up-to-date and accurate. It is now necessary to survey employees to update this information. The enclosed questionnaire is being issued to give all staff an opportunity to update their record and amend this information where changes have occurred. \n I appreciate that you may have already completed a similar questionnaire at some stage, but the completion of this questionnaire is vital to the University in progressing its Equal Opportunities Policy and I would encourage you to contribute to this exercise. \n The aim of this questionnaire is to update the following information: Postcode: To allow for the analysis of catchment areas. \n Marital Status: To update information currently held on marital status. \n Ethnic Origin: To comply with the University 's commitment to monitor on the grounds of race and to follow best practice as advocated by the Commission for Racial Equality for Northern Ireland (appointed following the introduction of the Race Relations (N.I.) Order 1997). \n Disability: To comply with the University 's commitment to monitor on the grounds of disability and to comply with best practice as advocated by the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. \n Note: The section on Disability contains    an   outline of the definition under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and the types of disabilities which are covered b the Act. If you have a disability, this section will also give you the opportunity to make suggestions as to what steps the University might take to help you in carrying out your duties. \n All the information you provide will be treated with the strictest levels of\nconfidentiality and will only be used to produce statistical summaries where the\nidentities of individuals will not appear.  The information will not be\navailable for any purpose other than Equal Opportunities Monitoring.  \n Please complete and return the enclosed questionnaire to this office before\n Friday 13 March 1998  to enable us to update our monitoring system\nas soon as possible.

More recent papers tend to be written by my research students\nand, to tell you the truth, are often published in some haste to get the data out, - they\nare not always literary works I would be proud of. \n Please ask if you think I can be of further help. \n Best regards   DR P J C MOORE  \n Encls \n\n\n<$D>\n 4 May, 1994 \n Dear Colleague, You will be aware that in the past the Library has encountered significant difficulty in buying the books needed to support the University 's teaching and research. During the past year or two the situation has improved considerably but I fear that some academic staff are not fully aware of this improvement. Consequently they may be holding back on submitting proposals for the purchase of books which are needed by their students or indeed by themselves. \n While there are limits to what we can spend I would be very grateful if you\nwould encourage the staff in your School to submit proposals for books which are\nneeded in support of their teaching, especially where new courses are coming on\nstream. It would be very helpful it academic staff could alert us to the need to buy\nadditional copies of heavily-used material. All such proposals should be\nsubmitted to the member of library staff who usually receives their proposals. If\nthe proposals are received soon then there is a better chance of us having the books\navailable for the beginning of the next academic year. \n Thank-you for your co-operation. \n Yours sincerely,  NORMAN J RUSSELL  Librarian  \n\n\n<$D>\n 17 May, 1994 \n Dear Colleague, I hope that you will be aware that for the past three years the Library has been engaged in the not inconsiderable task of converting all of its card catalogue records into a form where they can appear on the on-line public access catalogue. To mark the conclusion of the project there is to be a guest lecture, sponsored by BLPMP Library Services and OCLC Europe, on the theme,  \"Information access in the age of networks.\"  \n The lecturer is David R Worlock, a publisher with wide experience in\nmanaging folio and electronic publishing companies in educational, academic and\nprofessional information fields in United kingdom, European and international\nmarkets. His lecture will centre on the idea that increasingly widespread network\naccess - for voice, television or text availability - at ever greater bandwidths,\nconnotes an industrial revolution as profound and far-reaching as the Age of\nSteam. \n The lecture will take place at  4.00pm on Wednesday, 15th\nJune 1994 in the English Lecture Theatre.  I do hope that you will be\nable to attend. \n Yours sincerely,  NORMAN J RUSSELL  Librarian  \n\n\n<$E>\n 17th May 1994 \n Dear Colleague,  Conference of Queen 's University and Schools: Saturday, 18th June 1994  \n I am writing to invite you and/or members of your staff to the Conference of\nQueen 's University and Schools which will be held in the New Physics Lecture\nTheatre at 10.45 am on Saturday, 18th June. Coffee will be available\nin the Great Hall beforehand from 10.15 am. The Conference will finish with a\nsherry reception in the Canada Room followed by lunch in the Great Hall. \n We are very pleased to welcome as our guest speaker to the Conference\n\nProfessor Graeme Davies, Chief Executive of the Higher Education Funding Council,\nwho will talk about the implications of the various changes which have taken place in\nHigher Education in recent years. \n The numbers of graduates being produced by Higher Education have\nincreased dramatically in the last decade and this could have an effect on employment\nprospects. We have seen the disappearance of the binary line and also a\nconsiderable widening of access with the introduction of foundation Courses for\nmature students and, more recently, the GNVQ. At a time of expansion, the\nGovernment has now requested universities to reduce their intakes, especially in the\nArts-based areas. On the financial side, there will be increasing reliance on\nstudent loans in the future with the recent announcement of the reduction in the value\nof the student grant over the next three years. \n All of these matters will have consequences for Schools and Colleges, which\nproduce students for Higher Education, and also for the Institutions of Higher\nEducation themselves. \n We look forward to hearing Professor Davies and we hope that the\nConference will provide a forum for discussion and exchange of ideas. \n If you intend to come to this conference, and if you wish to accept the\ninvitations to the Reception and Lunch, please complete the attached reply form and\nreturn it so that we may receive it no later than  Monday, 6th June.  \n Yours sincerely,  S M Wisener  Schools Liaison Officer  \n\n\n<$F>\n 25 November 1992 \n Dear Colleague, Many of you will be aware of the recent introduction of a new Queen 's Affinity Card, and indeed some, as graduates of the University, will have received details by post. The Affinity Card is being offered exclusively, at this stage, to staff and graduates of Queen 's and to this end I have enclosed a copy of the brochure and an application form for your information. \n The launch of the Affinity Card is the first part of a new alumni outreach\nprogramme.

{"text": "<Belfast business 2>\n\n\n<$A>\n 23rd February, 1998. \n Dear Theatregoer, I have pleasure in enclosing information on two of our forthcoming productions here at the Lyric. \n Those of you who saw Gary Mitchell 's last play  In a Little World of Our Own  will know how quickly it sold out and early booking for the world premiere of  Tearing the Loom  is therefore essential. \n Anyone who enjoyed our sell-out success two years ago of  Dancing at Lughnasa  will know of the Lyric 's fondness for the work of Brian Friel. Our new production of  Translations  boasts an impressive cast that includes Roy Hanlon and Mark Mulholland. Roy was in the first ever production of  Translations  in 1980 alongside Stephen Rea, Mick Lally, Liam Neeson and Ray McAnally and is delighted to once again be starring in what many believe to be Friel 's finest play to date. \n And finally, don't forget that our current production of  Miss Julie  runs for two weeks only until 7th March. August Strindberg 's greatest play is also one of the most erotic masterpieces of world theatre in which sexual attraction and the sexual act are used as weapons in the class war, and in the battle between the sexes.  Not suitable for children.  \n If all of the above productions take your fancy, then why not make the most of our Spring Subscription Offer.  If you book for all 3 shows, you pay for only 2!  \n To book your tickets, please telephone the Box Office between 10am and 7pm, Monday to Saturday on  (01232)381081. \n We look forward to seeing you at the Lyric soon. \n Yours sincerely,  Richard Gaston PR/Marketing Manager \n\n\n<$B>\n Dr G F Crowe 23 Ardmore Drive Newcastle Downs Belfast BT7 9 February 1998 \n Dear Dr Crowe We are pleased to forward to you, as a patron of the Grand Opera House, a copy of our 1998 January to July Season Brochure. \n We hope that you will agree that the kaleidoscope of fine productions that we have selected for this season confirms that the Grand Opera House is truly A Theatre for Everyone. We would like to draw your attention to several productions which we feel will be of interest to your particular tastes. \n Opera Northern Ireland 's production of  HANSEL AND GRETEL  by Humperdinck comes to the Grand Opera House Stage from Sunday 1 to Saturday 7 March. Two children wandering in the forest...an evil witch...distracted parents...all the ingredients of a classic fairy tale given an original twist in Opera Northern Ireland 's production. Further details can be found on page 10. \n On Monday March Peter Knapp proves that the wonderful thing we call Opera can appeal to absolutely everybody.  \"ALL YOU EVER WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT OPERA\"  by Travelling Opera is presented by Opera Northern Ireland and the Grand Opera House.

Further details on both of these performances can be found on page 11. \n On Saturday 28 March, The European Opera Centre accompanied by The Opera for Europe Chorus presents Mozart 's  LUCIO SILLA . This is a rare opportunity to experience a fully staged gem amongst Mozart 's works.

Please refer to page 20 for further details. \n Following its sell out production of La Sylphide in May 1996, The National Ballet Company of Latvia accompanied by the orchestra of Latvia National Opera and Ballet, present Tchaikovsky 's  THE SLEEPING BEAUTY . Exquisitely danced by the soloists and full chorus of this dynamic company, this production is a tribute to the rigorous Russian conventions of training and performance to which this company remains dedicated.

It is a story of love (requited and unrequited) and betrayal, told in music which excites and thrills. \n 'Nabucco' is the Old Testament character Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, who, after taking Judah captive, repents of tyranny and embraces Judaism. His daughter Abigail attempts to use her power to win the affection of Jewish leader Israel, and treacherously robs her father of the crown. Fearing harsh judgement after her father 's conversion, she takes her own life. These large-scale events inspired Verdi to write scorching tunes and driving rhythms. \n The Lodz Opera is a Polish state company, with powerful soloists and a superb orchestra. Conductor Andrzej Straszynski is one of Poland 's finest. For this visit to Belfast, they are sending forty members of their sonorous chorus, for a work with some of the most inspired choral writing in Italian opera. NABUCCO features on of the most famous opera tunes - the nostalgic lament of the Jewish exiles for their distant homeland. \n I am sure you will enjoy it. Performances start at 7.30, and end at approximately 10.15. Ticket prices begin at <*> pound sign </*> 12, with discounts for groups, students and senior citizens. Full details can be found on the enclosed leaflet. Because the opera is sung in Italian, we shall be providing, free of charge, a plot summary with all tickets booked. \n Contact the Ticket Shop at 2 / 4 Great Victoria Street (telephone 01232- 241919). NABUCCO guarantees a thrilling evening of grand opera. I hope that we can once again look forward to welcoming you to Northern Ireland 's Premier Theatre. \n Yours sincerely  DEREK NICHOLLS  THEATRE DIRECTOR  \n\n\n<$D>\n Dr Gordon Crowe Queen 's University BELFAST BT7 1NN \n Dear Dr Crowe I am writing to let you know that the Voluntary Activity Unit (VAU) was re-launched as the Voluntary and Community Unit (VCU) on 20th May 2002. \n The VAU was established within the old Department for Health and Social Services in 1993, and was intended to be the focal point for voluntary and community activity within the Northern Ireland Civil Service. The original remit of the Unit was to assume lead responsibility for voluntary and community sector development across Government and to provide the structures necessary for interdepartmental debate on key issues in the field. The Unit subsequently evolved to take on a much wider role and range of activities than was originally envisaged. \n The Unit moved to the Department for Social Development following devolution and a review of the Unit 's work was then commissioned. The central finding of the Review focussed on the cross-cutting nature of the work of the VAU, its need to provide increased support to other Departments in the development of effective and consistent relationships with the voluntary and community sector, and the importance of ensuring the sustainability of the voluntary and community sector. We have therefore changed our name to \"The Voluntary and Community Unit\". \n If you would like to know more, an information leaflet about the work of the Unit is available from Vicki Haire, Voluntary and Community Unit, DSD, Churchill House, Victoria Square, Belfast, BT1 4SD. Tel. 018 9056 9318. \n Yours sincerely,  Dave Wall Director \n\n\n<$E>\n<$F>\n 16th May 1994\n Dear Gordon, We are carrying out research on the impact of the Teaching and Learning Technology Programme (TLTP) with a view to identifying the factors influencing the use of computers in the University. Earlier this year we wrote to your director for permission to discuss the use of computers with a member of staff with responsibility for, or an interest in, this area. We also asked for permission to observe classes using computers within the school or department. Your name was suggested as the person we should talk to with respect to these matters and this letter is to brief you on our plans. \n We have just carried out a questionnaire survey of 835 full-time level 0 and 1 undergraduates to investigate their general attitudes to computers, their specific opinions of computing at the University, their knowledge of computers and their previous experience and current usage of computers. Our planned follow up includes interviewing some of the students on the main issues arising from the survey. Once the survey has been analysed, we hope you will be able to meet with us to discuss your perspective, and that of your school or department, in relation to teaching an learning with computers. Your assistance in arranging observation visits and opportunities to interview students will be particularly appreciated. We would hope to contact you before the summer recess but if not we will be in touch early in the new academic year. \n If you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact us at Ext. 7128 (John Gardner) or Ext. 3898 (Jill McMahon). \n Yours sincerely,  Dr. John Gardner Director, School of Education Jill McMahon Research Officer \n\n\n<$G>\n Dr Gordon F Crowe 19 Sloane Way BELFAST 31st August 1994 \n Dear Dr Crowe With much of our internal reorganisation complete and the cross-harbour road system surrounding our warehouse nearing completion the time has come to introduce some Autumn wine evenings. \n Due to a demand for more specialist evenings our traditional wine course is being postponed until the new year; in its place we are offering a series of four wine and supper evenings providing an opportunity to taste a wider and superior range of wines from  Italy, Burgundy/Beaujolais, Rh&/\\one/Provence  and  Bordeaux  respectively - each evening will be conducted by expert and knowledgeable tasters with a particular interest in the region concerned. A special price is available to those attending the series of all four tastings. \n<P> We are pleased to be welcoming Stanley Moss of  Bodegas Torres  to Belfast in September. This will offer yet another chance to savour the fine wines produced by our award-winning Catalonian producer. An illustrated tasting of a range of stylish Torres wines will be followed by a full buffet supper. \n Finally, we are taking an opportunity to introduce our new range of Australian wines. The  Rothbury  venture represents a new direction for 'New World' winemaking with an emphasis upon both varietal and regional individuality. Native Australian, Dennis Power is conducting a tasting at Direct Wine Shipments which again will be followed by a full buffet supper. \n We hope that these evenings will offer something of interest to you. Early application is advised to avoid disappointment - we look forward to seeing you. \n Yours sincerely  Kevin McAlindon Managing Director \n\n\n<$H>\n 256 Ormeau Road Belfast BT7 2FZ \n Mr G F Crowe 19 Sloane Way Belfast 23 November 1995 \n Dear Mr Crowe Thank you for your letter. \n I am indeed sorry to learn of the difficulties you have experiences with your Creda Tumble Dryer. \n Our records show a service call on 15 July 1995 at which time a replacement timer and relay were fitted. \n A further call on 2 November 1995 was carried out by our engineer, the fault reported was noises. \n I am informed by the engineer that he recommended replacement pulleys, which although were not on his vehicle, would have been put on order for you. He did offer to grease the pulleys in the meantime but advised you that charges would be made since the repair was different to that carried out on 15 July 1995, and that you refused to have the pulleys fitted. \n Creda therefore do not accept that we have a liability to make any reimbursement and we would not therefore be in a position to refund any monies paid. \n May I apologise for any inconvenience you have been caused. \n Yours sincerely  B Toner Area Manager HOTPOINT CREDA CANNON SERVICE", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "119a9823-d4d4-4d39-a024-5585e84ddcfe", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.550028+00:00"}

Antrim \n 12 May, 1994 \n Dear Dr Webb, We exhibited at the Academic Advice Road show last week, which I believe you also attended. I must say that we were surprised at the bias of academics against locally manufactured clone computers. \n Typical comments were  \"Oh we have to buy IBM/Compaq/Apple or we can only deal with companies with a <*> pound sign </*> 10 million turnover\" . \n To be fair we have seen this attitude in some large local businesses as well. But let me ask you, if you have a policy of buying American computers and thus exporting jobs who do you expect will employ your graduates? We now employ seven sales and technical staff on the clone side of our business. \n It actually took a big American company to demonstrate that local clones do have merit over the big brands. Seagate Technologies (the world 's largest producer of hard disks) gave us an order for one hundred clones when they set up their plant in L'Derry. We sent six machines to their HQ in Minnesota for tests before we won this order. \n Clones are good value. They are totally upgradeable, even to Pentium technology. They can also be cheaper and easier to maintain because of the standard nature of the boards used. \n Please reconsider. If you are interested in receiving information on our clones please let us know. \n Yours faithfully, Daniel MacAllister \n\n\n<$E>\n 19 December 1995 \n Mr M P WEBB 26 CRAWLEY RD.

Some 56 projects were funded in Northern Ireland over this period. A new funding round will commence early in 1995, and, as a preliminary to that, the Northern Ireland authorities (in this case the Training and Employment Agency) are anxious to take the views of as wide a spectrum of interested parties as possible. The new Initiative on Employment and the Development of Human Resources will have three strands: Now, Horizon and Youthstart. \n The European and International Section of the Training and Employment Agency is charged with the task of drawing up the Operational Programme under which the initiative will operate in Northern Ireland. A draft must be with the Commission by September 30, and the final Operational Programme by October 31 1994, in order to have approval by the end of December 1994. \n In order to make the new Operational Programme as responsive as possible to the needs of Northern Ireland in the area of employment and development of human resources, a period of consultation will now begin. It will be managed by the NIUETP on behalf of the Training and Employment Agency. \n This will be in three stages: 1. Invitations to interested parties to submit, in writing, their views on current provision and the gaps therein, along with recommendations on how the shortfall might be addressed. 2. A series of workshops/seminars bringing together the interested parties to discuss the written submissions referred to above. 3. Production of a final report synthesising the outcomes of the workshops/seminars, and forming the basis for the new Northern Ireland Operational Programme. \n I attach a copy of the Commission 's guidelines on the new initiative and a copy of the report of the working group we established last December, drawn from existing NOW, EUROFORM <*> ampersand </*> HORIZON promoters. This is a valuable document and could be a useful starting point in your deliberations on the new Operational Programme. \n Could I suggest you focus your attention on the following points: 1. Describe what you see as the current provision in Northern Ireland for your area of interest, in terms of development of Human Resources. 2. Identify what you perceive as being the short-comings of that provision, in relation to the particular groups you work with. 3. Suggest ways in which the gaps identified above could be filled by imaginative and innovative programmes of training. \n We would like to have your written submissions by  August 23 at the latest , and we will be running the workshops/seminars during the week beginning September 5. I realise that this timescale is fairly tight, but the Commission 's calendar is dictating the pace of progress. \n A further date for your diary: - November 15 Formal launch of the new initiative, Balmoral Hall, Belfast. This occasion will serve to celebrate the achievements of the current projects under NOW, EUROFORM and HORIZON, and also to launch formally the new Initiative on Development of Human Resources. The current promoters will be offered a stand at which to display their wares, and it will be open to the public and representatives of sectoral interests, government bodies and policy makers will be invited to attend. Details in due course. \n I hope you will take    the   time to made a written submission to us, as the content of the new Operational Programme will be directly influenced by the outcomes of the consultation process. \n Yours sincerely, Pat Donnelly Director NI UETP Encl. \n\n\n<$J>\n 22 January 1997 \n Dr Webb 26 Crawley Rd.

The Association funds medical research in Queen 's University Belfast into both the treatment and the prevention of chest, heart and stroke illnesses. These illnesses amount to 10,000 deaths each year in Northern Ireland. Many of these deaths are premature and could be prevented. \n The Association also funds work to help in the rehabilitation of stroke patients and those suffering from heart disease. Support is also provided to alleviate the suffering caused by emphysema and asthma through the provision of home nebulisers to those with particularly acute bouts of chest illness. \n  How can you help us tackle these problems which affect many people in Northern Ireland? \n An easy, flexible and tax-free way of giving is through the Give As You Earn Scheme where your donation is deducted from your salary each month (before tax is paid!). In real terms you only donate three quarters of the amount you select e.g. a <*> pound sign </*> 10.00 donation means only a <*> pound sign </*> 7.50 Monthly deduction. Simply, the charity receives more than you give. By using this scheme the taxman is obliged to make up the difference.  \n I would ask you to consider giving a sum to charity through this scheme.

The research was undertaken by Michael McDonagh, a Traveller, who has obtained third - level education. He lives in Navan. \n The report recommends further in-depth study by a Traveller, supported by an academic team with appropriate experience and knowledge. \n ACT is keen that this preliminary investigation does not  'gather dust on a shelf' . There seems to be merit in taking the study further preferably under the guidance and co-ordination of a university research unit. The Institute of Irish Studies seems to me to be a good place to start. \n I would welcome a discussion with you or a member of your Department to explore the possibilities. I enclose a copy of ACT 's latest report for information. \n Yours sincerely  P J HOLMES  Secretary to ACT (Special Projects Branch, DOE (NI) \n\n\n<$E>\n Dr R B Deane 26 Parkhill Road\nBelfast \n 1 February 1993 \n Dear Dr Deane For a number of years I have been advising clients and in particular those in the field of Education i.e., Principals, Lecturers and Teachers on relevant financial issues.

The enclosed leaflet details the simple procedure you have to follow. \n  <*> bullet point </*> Cheque writing facility  \n First Trust Visa Card now offers you the ability to pay for goods and services from your Visa Card account using your own personalised Visa cheques - an ideal way to pay household bills or using in shops and stores that do not accept credit cards. \n  <*> bullet point </*> Direct Debit Option  \n Forgetting to make your payments on time will be a thing of the past. Monthly Direct Debit repayments ensure that you receive the full credit period and are never late with your payment. \n The enclosed leaflet explains how you have up to 3 ways to win one of 10 weekends for two in London. \n  Yet another way to win  \n To help us help you, I would ask you to take a couple of moments to complete the enclosed Customer Service questionnaire thereby giving you yet another opportunity to enter our London Weekend Competition. An entry form is included in the questionnaire. \n  And we are reducing our interest rate.  \n We are reducing our interest rate from 1.95 <*> per cent sign </*> per month (APR 26.00 <*> per cent sign </*> ) to 1.87 <*> per cent sign </*> per month (APR 24.9 <*> per cent sign </*>) per month from 23rd September. For cash advances, the new APR will be 26.7 <*> per cent sign </*>. \n We are also introducing a change in the method of calculating interest on our Visa Card. From 23rd September 1994 interest on purchases will be calculated from the date that transactions are debited to your account, while interest on cash advances will be calculated from the statement date. In the case of cash advances a 1.5 <*> per cent sign </*> transaction charge on the amount withdrawn will apply (subject to a minimum of <*> pound sign </*> 1.50 per transaction). A summary of the changes and a copy of your new terms and conditions are enclosed. \n First Trust Visa Cardolders, who repay their accounts in full by the payment due date detailed on the monthly statement, will not incur any interest in that month. The interest free credit period of up to 56 days remains unchanged, and there is still no annual fee for your First Trust Visa Card. \n At First Trust Bank, our goal is to provide you with a personal customer service, that is locally based putting you the customer first. I hope that you will take advantage of our new services and in the process win one of our London Weekend breaks. \n If you require any further information please do not hesitate to contact our Customer Services staff telephone (0232) 241822. \n Yours sincerely  CF Healy Head of Card <*> ampersand </*> Retailer Services", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "8d397452-8175-40b3-83ee-b65458da9dd7", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.551889+00:00"}

It is therefore possible that the permit issued is different from that you requested. c) That permits are only valid for the car park they are issued for, and in the name of those who apply. They are not transferable. Deviation from this rule will result in the withdrawal of the privilege to hold a parking permit. Please note that the permit remains the property of the University. d) That as only one parking permit is being issued to each applicant, staff using another vehicle as a temporary expedient should make arrangements, in advance, with the Security Supervisor if they wish it to be admitted to a University car park. e) That staff normally based in buildings remote from the Main Site, who wish to gain access to the Main Site or College Park car park to attend stated committee meetings should make arrangements in advance with the Security Supervisor. Such cars will be admitted if space permits. Special arrangements will be made for meetings of Senate, Academic Council and Faculties. f) That members of staff who are expecting visitors on official business are reminded that they must inform the Security Supervisor at least two hours before their visitors wish to gain admission. g) That members of staff who have received permits for the Biology, Fitzwilliam, MBC or Chlorine Gardens car park for the first time should contact Mr M Haddon, Security Supervisor, on Ext 5067 to obtain a magnetic barrier key.

In fact, within the next 35 minutes someone in the United Kingdom will die as a result of an accident. And by the time the day is over accidents will have claimed the lives of nearly 42 people - in many instances leaving behind financial hardship for loved ones. \n Startling statistics like these have prompted First Trust Bank to make an exceptional Accidental Death Insurance Plan available to you and other eligible Cardholders. \n  To underline the importance to all of us of such protection, we are providing each eligible Cardholder with the opportunity to have <*> pound sign </*> 1,000 of this valuable cover at no cost.

You 'll learn that no First Trust Bank Visa Cardholder aged 17 or above and under 70 will be refused cover - regardless of health or occupation. And no medical examination or health questions are necessary. You 'll learn, too, that this cover protects you 24 hours a day ... anywhere in the world. \n Applying is easy. To receive your <*> pound sign </*> 1,000 First Trust Bank Accidental Death protection at no cost, simply complete the personalised Application Form enclosed and return it in the prepaid envelope supplied. Provided you remain a First Trust Bank Visa Cardholder, your <*> pound sign </*> 1,000 cover will remain in force for a period of 10 years, and there will be no cost to you at any time. If you wish to exercise your right to also apply for a more substantial amount of cover, just tick the additional benefit amount you desire on the same form. \n When your Application Form has been processed, your Insurance Policy will be forwarded by post for your inspection. If you selected additional cover, your monthly premium will be automatically charged to your First Trust Bank Visa Account each month (please ensure that you have completed and signed the Payment Instruction portion of your Application). \n But please don't delay.

Although this approach to learning is now an important component of post-graduate education and training, and the success of the Open University attests to its value for undergraduate education, it has not been widely employed within a traditional university setting. Such courses could be used as part of a module requiring part-time attendance at the university or as an independent module to be completed entirely by distance learning. It may also be an attractive option for many students allowing them greater flexibility in organising their studies. \n I am interested to know what experience academic staff at Queen 's have of preparing self-study material or of using prepared self-study courses. I would also like to know your views on the benefits or otherwise of self-study compared with other learning methods. \n I would be grateful if you would answer the following questionnaire and  return it to me by 11th March  via the internal mail.

{"text": "<Tunnel - TD>\n\n\n<$A>\n 17TH JULY 1996 CLLR. D. MCDOWELL, T.D. 107C MALAHIDE ROAD, DONNYCARNEY, DUBLIN 3. \n  RE: DUBLIN PORT TUNNEL (D.P.T.)  \n Dear Councillor, I refer to your letter dated 21st May 1996 to the National Roads Authority, and to Mr. J. Fitzgerald, City Manager. \n In your letter the first three paragraphs list some of the genuine concerns that residents along, and close to, the route have in relation to the scheme. Both the Consultants and the project management team are fully aware of these issues and they are being fully addressed within the E. I. S. for the scheme. In addition many meetings and briefings have been held with various residents ' groups and local organisations. Exhibitions were held at three locations along the route during December 1995 and January 1996, with a permanent exhibition mounted in the Civic Offices since the latter date. All people who attended these exhibitions were given the opportunity to comment on the proposals and to highlight their concerns, and these were considered as part of the design and E.I.S. preparation process. In addition to these exhibitions, group briefings, and public meetings which were held, many individuals, representatives, associations, and interest groups contacted various personnel attached to the project seeking information or expressing their views. All of these contacts were responded to, usually by written reply, giving whatever details were being sought. Like all other aspects of the project, this was done in a courteous, respectful and helpful way. \n The allegations that  \"the project managers have behaved in an arrogant and unhelpful way\"  is completely without foundation and is totally rejected. At all times the public 's queries and concerns have been dealt with courteously and efficiently. It has been our objective from the commencement of planning of this project to inform the public to the best of our abilities and also to ascertain their concerns so that the E.I.S. can be as broad and effective as possible. I must note however that the \"project managers\" have had to endure abuse and invective of an extreme nature from certain parties opposed to the project. The opposition in some areas is of such a hostile nature that Dublin Corporation senior personnel, and the Consultants Geoconsult - Arup, were forced to withdraw from one public meeting, such was the level of abuse that they were being subjected to. \n Your letter also refers to the allegations of structural damage during the site investigation. Representatives of Geoconsult - Arup JV and Dublin Corporation met with local residents on 4th April 1996 and proposed, on the basis of an independent opinion from Forbairt, that the same drill rig be used to generate vibrations which could be then measured and assessed at the locations of the alleged cracks. This proposal was rejected by the residents which is regrettable. It is the considered opinion of the technical experts in Geoconsult - Arup JV that the vibrations from the drill rig could not cause structural damage and a number of tests were carried out in other areas subsequently which confirmed their views. However they are more than willing to re-check the vibrations in the contentious areas if so allowed. \n At all stages of the project due regard is given to the legislative and statutory provisions pertaining to the scheme. In particular this applies to the E.I.S. which is being prepared in full accordance with the Roads Act 1993 and the Road Regulations 1994. Wide scale consultation has been carried out during the preparation of the E.I.S. as recommended in the draft E.P.A. guidelines. \n On the second page of the letter it is stated that  \"very many people have little or no confidence in the project managers or any of the Authorities.\"  It is not accepted that this is an accurate reflection of the views of the many people concerned, but instead is the reaction from a small number of people who are vehemently opposed to the tunnel. It is in this context, that the statement regarding confidence should be viewed. It is a matter of concern, of course, that there is a suggestion of lack of confidence. The project team and all parties associated with the planning and design of the scheme will continue to provide comprehensive information to, and meet with, local people and their representatives. The modes of consultation will be reassessed to see if they can be more direct and effective and also to build up greater rapport with local groups. \n Your letter continues on to suggest that funding should be provided to local residents ' associations, to allow them to commission independent research and advice. On the basis of a Dublin Corporation management decision, this suggestion was rejected earlier in the case of one particular group who had requested funding. It is considered that this was the correct decision and should continue to apply. The design work that has been done, has been executed in a professional, thorough and unbiased manner, and must be supported as such. Funding of separate research by opposition groups is not necessary provided that the general and technical information in the E.I.S. be made available to the various interested groups, at least for inspection, and preferably for sale of copy. \n It is noted that under Section 50 (2) (b) of the Roads Act 1993 that the E.I.S. must contain  \"the data necessary to identify and assess the main effects which the proposed road development is likely to have on the environment\".  The purpose of this provision is to ensure that the public can examine information that the proposing Authority has collected on the environmental effects. The critical issue is that the information is made readily available to the public and Dublin Corporation will be scrupulously careful in this regard. \n In summary there is no basis to the allegations concerning the conduct and operations of the project team. In all respects, and at all stages of the project to date, the scheme has been progressed in accordance with all legal requirements and obligations, and in a proper and professional manner at all times. Finally all the main environmental data collected for the E.I.S. will be made available to the public as required under the Roads Act and in fulfillment of the democratic process. \n I trust that the above information is satisfactory. \n Yours sincerely,  ROY CHAMP, A/ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER.  \n\n\n<$A>\n 5th November, 1996.    To whom it may concern Re: Dublin Port Tunnel  \n Dear Sir / Madam, Following the publication of the E.I.S. for the proposed A6 route for Dublin Port Tunnel, a Consultative Group was set up by the Corporation comprising Dublin Corporation officials, elected representatives and representatives of the community. A list of the community representatives who have been attending is attached for your information. Eleven meetings of this group were held prior to the City Council meeting on 7th October, 1996. \n At that meeting, the City Council agreed that a Draft Variation of the Dublin City Development Plan be initiated and recommended that a series of 5 alternative routes, in addition to the A6 route, should form part of the public display. \n Because the total of the six routes now under consideration embrace a much wider corridor than that of the A6 route alone, residents and groups not included in the Consultative Group to date may be affected by one or other of the options. The next meeting of this group will be held in Room 409, Floor 4, Block 2, Civic Offices, Dublin 8, at 6.00 p.m. on Thursday 7th November, 1996, and your association is invited to send one representative. The agenda for that meeting is attached. \n I also enclose an information handout which provides an A4 size map and some information on each of the six routes. \n Access to the Civic Offices car park has been arranged. If you wish to avail of this car park, please let me know the registration no. and make of car before 12 noon on Thursday. The entrance to this car park is on Winetavern Street and it will be open until 6.30 pm. Exit from the car park will only be possible when the meeting is finished. \n Yours faithfully, Roy Champ  Acting Administrative Officer\n\n\n<$A>\n  CLLR. D.

The intention is to divide the tunnel route into three sections:\na) Whitehall/Santry area (Northern Section). b) Marino area (Bored Tunnel Section).< >#> c) Fairview/East Wall area (Southern Section).\n These three geographical areas also coincide with the three distinct bands of concerns that exist along the route. \n The elected councillors from each area have also been invited to attend. It is intended to discuss the matter of the setting-up of a consultative body or bodies at these meetings. \n I trust that the foregoing information is satisfactory. \n Yours sincerely,\n ROY CHAMP, A/ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER.  \n\n\n<$B>\n 14th February 1996.

Beverton, Donabate for \"Bovale Developments Limited\"  \n On behalf of my clients, I wish to made representations and list these below in support for changing the zoning of these lands to residential use. \n I enclose a location map showing the lands edged red and further small scale plan showing how a pedestrian link could be planned to accommodate a short safe way to the school and shops. \n Also enclosed is a layout plan showing a suggested layout for a housing development of 510 houses and incorporating a leisure centre. \n There is an existing golf course to the north of this site and a new one to be built to the western boundary of the site known as Turvey House, these form natural boundaries for development. The site is also close to the centre of village and on the eastern side of the railway which means vehicles leaving this site quickly connect to the Belfast/Dublin Road without passing through the centre of the village. \n These lands are immediately adjacent to the Kinane Development lands and any service road or footpath connections could be provided. \n Bovale Developments Limited have built many houses in the Swords area and the only available lands now left for development are in a few hands, my clients therefore see this site in Donabate as a well located site for development which has the advantage of a good rail service for people working in Dublin and good roads for travelling to Dublin and the Airport. \n The site is located within easy reach of the village school and shops and has the advantage of the local amenities such as beaches and Newbridge House and grounds. \n Should this site be rezoned for residential development, my clients would be willing to phase the development in order that integration with the local community and services could take place at a reasonable pace. \n There is a 12 <*> inch sign </*> diameter public foul sewer in adjoining lands and surface water could be discharged through water courses to the tidal outfall to the north of this site. \n It is, therefore, our contention that the above lands are well located and adjacent to the existing village with its amenities and would form a logical extension to same and would enhance the area with a good choice of house designs together with a new leisure centre which would be available for use by all the residents of the area. \n We therefore urge your Council to give careful consideration to these lands and rezone them for residential use. \n\n\n<$A>\n Dear Sir   Re: Draft Development Plan 1991 \u00d0 4 hectares of lands at Lime Tree Avenue, Portmarnock \u00d0 \"Bovale Developments Limited\" \n On behalf of my clients Messrs.

(RTE estimate that the cost will be approximately <*> pound sign </*> 80,000 per annum). \n 4 Power and spares to be charged to the contractor on an actual cost basis. (RTE estimate that the cost will be approximately <*> pound sign </*> 115,000 per annum). \n 5 An overhead charge of 5 <*> per cent sign </*> payable to RTE will be levied on the charges at 1,2,3, <*> ampersand </*> 4 above. \n 6 RTE will require the transmitting and associated equipment for 14 FM transmission sites (estimated cost <*> pound sign </*> 260,000). The actual cost of the equipment will be financed on the best available terms over a 14 year period and the capital cost and interest charges will be levied on the contractor over that period. The project management and installation charge for the National FM coverage and the AM coverage (Dublin and Cork) will be <*> pound sign </*> 250,000 plus 5 <*> per cent sign </*> for overheads. The residual value of equipment at the end of the 14 year period will    accrue   to Century Communications \n These charges have been fixed on the basis that (1) RTE, if required, will ensure that the new service will be broadcast in Dublin and Cork areas on and from 1 May, 1989 and (2) that there will be no undue delay in agreeing the schedule of transmitting and associated broadcasting equipment to be acquired and its installation within the time-frame set by the I.R.T.C. \nYours sincerely RAY BURKE TD Minister for Industry and Commerce and for Communications \n\n\n<$C>\n<$D>\n Rt.

Mr. Justice Seamus Henchy, Chairman, The Independent Radio and Television Commission, Marine House, Clanwilliam Court, Dublin, 2. \n 17th February, 1989. \n OB/JS/ra. \nDear Chairman,  We wish to advise you that at a Board Meeting of Century Communications Limited held on Tuesday 14th February, Laurence Crowley was co-opted to the Board of Directors and elected Chairman, Terry Wogan and Chris de Burgh were also co-opted to the Board of Directors. In due course the new directors will be participating in up to 12 1/2 <*> per cent sign </*> of the company 's equity. This information remains confidential until 17.00 hrs Monday 20 February when it will be released to the Press. \n The Board Meeting reviewed the question of transmission charges. They were of the unanimous opinion that the <*> pound sign </*> 375,000 offered to RTE for full transmission service was, given the advice that they had from the IBA, fair and reasonable. Furthermore, they were of the unanimous view that they were not prepared to negotiate or increase that offer as it would effect the viability of the service. They expressed their concern that RTE, as custodian of the National transmission network, had an obvious conflict of interest with their role as providers of transmission services to the independent broadcasters and that in the circumstances they could not understand why, given that the Minister has power under the Act, a directive has not been given to RTE. \n At the public hearing on 12th January 1989, we stated that we could provide the service within 90 days of the signing of contracts. At that time there was 108 days to the 1st May. When the award was made on 18th January, there were 102 days left. We received the Broadcast Contract on 9th February and would hope to be able to agree the terms of that contract by the end of next week. As of today, there are 72 days left to the 1st May and we are particularly concerned that the issue of the transmission charges has not been resolved and that there appears to be no way in which it is going to be resolved to meet that date. We are prepared to meet all the extra studio installation costs associated with a shorter deadline and be on air 1st May but we are particularly concerned that there appears to be no urgency to resolve the issue on transmission. \n At this stage we must advise you that unless the matter is resolved within the next seven days there is no way in which we can be expected to meet the original date envisaged and furthermore we will have to reconsider our entire position. \n Such is the urgency of this matter that we remain available to meet with you at any time to suit your convenience. \nYours sincerely, Oliver Barry James Stafford\nDIRECTORS: OLIVER BARRY, JAMES JOSEPH STAFFORD\n\n\n<$E>\n 15 February 1989   Mr. Ray Burke, T. D. Minister for Communications Department of Industry <*> ampersand </*> Commerce Kildare Street Dublin 2 \n BY FAX. To 760431 \nDear Minister  I refer to our discussions on 14 February 1989 in connection with points put to you by the IRTC in relation to charges proposed by us for the provision of various transmission services for Century Communications Ltd. \n The Commission referred to various levels of charge by the IBA in the UK. It is our strongly held view that comparison between such charges and our proposals are invalid for a number of reasons e.g. area covered, accessibility of sites, costs of equipment (lower VAT rates in UK), Irish Pound/Sterling exchange differentials etc. \n We have, however, as requested, reviewed very fully again our charges. In relation to the final annual charge of <*> pound sign </*> 692,000 quoted, there are two areas we have specially examined. A full maintenance service is included in this figure for <*> pound sign </*> 364,000. We expect to achieve worthwhile reductions in labour costs in this area over the next two years and are prepared now to anticipate this and pass the benefit on immediately in our proposed charges. This will give a reduction of <*> pound sign </*> 44,000 in the <*> pound sign </*> 364,000 figure. \n We have also considered the overheads allocation previously shown at 10 <*> per cent sign </*>. Because of the specialist nature of the services to be provided, we can accept that it would be more appropriate to charge only a proportion of that figure viz. 5 <*> per cent sign </*>. \n Taking these two provisions into account will reduce our earlier figure of <*> pound sign </*> 692,000 down to <*> pound sign </*> 614,000 per annum. Depending on actual physical implementation of the project, we would expect a build up to this final figure in the following approximate manner (all at October 1988 prices):\n 1989 <*> pound sign </*> 200,000 1990 <*> pound sign </*> 430,000 1991 <*> pound sign </*> 530,000 1992 <*> pound sign </*> 614,000 \n On a final point of detail, I can confirm that in all our figures there are no accelerated rates of depreciation used. Our computations provide for rates used in our audited accounts \u00d0 accepted industry norms. \n I trust the foregoing additional information will enable us very quickly now to conclude all outstanding matters with the Commission or Century Communications, as appropriate. We are very conscious that it is now just ten weeks to 1st May next \u00d0 a date which RTE would be just as concerned to achieve as all the other interested parties. \nYours sincerely\nVincent Finn \n\n\n<$F>\n 6 February 1989   Mr Ray Burke TD Minister for Communications \n Dear Minister I enclose copies of documentation in connection with the charges being sought by RTE for providing transmission services to Century Communications for the independent national radio station. \n The matter is now extremely urgent as contracts for the provision of the new transmission equipment must be signed in the next few days if the new station is to make the proposed start-up date of May 1st. In the circumstances I would appreciate your urgent observations/decision on the charges being sought. \n Yours sincerely\nSean Connolly\nSecretary", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c6e18a3c-3194-44b9-99e7-c5bf9b75119f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.556092+00:00"}

I would be very grateful if you could let me know whether the Association has considered possible remedies to this problem which I could put to the Roads <*> ampersand </*> Traffic Committee. There are draconian measures that could be proposed such as closure of the road at one end or one-way systems. However such suggestions though supported by some residents, might be a major inconvenience to others. I would be very grateful for any advice that you can give on this. \n Kind regards.

I would be delighted to come to your meeting on Thursday 2nd 1995. However I should say that I hold Advice Centres on a Thursday evening which run until about 8.45pm. It is unlikely therefore that I could be at your meeting much before 9.00pm. Please let me know whether that would suit. \n In the meantime if there are any issues which your association would like me to take up either in my capacity of Dublin Corporation or as a local TD, please do not hesitate to contact me. I am taking an active interest in a number of issues of local concern that have been brought to my attention such as the many traffic problems in the area, and the desire by residents to have hearings on the subject of lane closures in the area. I am pleased that at long last the date of the hearing from lane closures has been now fixed. I enclose a letter I have received recently from the Planning Department which outlines their approach. \n Kind regards,\nYours sincerely, CLLR.

Location of the Terminus   \n Drivers have been instructed to continue on to the south side of Griffith Avenue and passengers will be allowed to stay on the bus. \n 2.   Level of Service   \n As you are aware the service was introduced only this year and the overall capacity being provided is greater than that of the old Route 24 but because of the popularity of the service, there are difficulties catering for all the demands. However additional buses have been purchased and are being injected into the service from today and it is hoped that this will improve the situation. \n 3.   Bunching   \n The buses are scheduled to depart at eight minute intervals but unfortunately because of the variation in time coming from Drimnagh across the city some buses arrive late at Marino and while they would depart immediately this can result in bunching. Unfortunately there is no easy solution to the problem but we are constantly seeking improved traffic management measures from Dublin Corporation and the assistance of the Gardai with illegal parking, phasing of traffic lights etc. in order to improve the traffic flow situation. \n 4.   Fast Driving   \n Your comments about fast driving around the greens within the Marino Estate will be brought to the attention of all concerned. \n Thanks for your interest in the matter. \n Yours sincerely,  DICK MURPHY    Area Manager West   \n\n\n<$C>\n 13th June 1994 \n Ref.

D.  \n\n\n<$D>\n Councillor Ivor Callely, T.D. \"Lansesdale House\", St. Lawrence Road, Clontarf, Dublin 3. \n  RE: Naming of Public Parks  \n Dear Councillor, The question of the naming of public parks has been raised in the context of Ashington Park, Navan Road and also in the Marino/Fairview area. It was requested that a brief note explaining Corporation policy on this subject be circulated to the local Councillors. \n In the case of the naming of municipal housing estates, a purposeful attempt is made to select a name which relates them to some local, historical, social or political connection with that area of the city. As a consequence, the name of the local public park usually follows this practice but in any event the public tend to link the name of that park with the name of the surrounding area. \n There have been two departures from these guidelines where the names were changed but the public continued to call them by their old names because of their strong associations with the area. This has happened in Merrion Square Park and also Nephin Park which was officially named Pope John Paul II Park. I enclose for your information a map of the Dublin City Parks which shows amongst other things a list of the names of 52 parks from which you can see that all the names relate to the locality in which the parks are situated or to some historical name or association with the area. \n These considerations form the basis of official policy in naming public parks. \n Yours sincerely, C.

The situation is that the Corporation are liable for the maintenance and repairs of public sewers and the carrying out of remedial works as appropriate. \n In the case of private drains they are the responsibility of the householder or householders served by them. Cases frequently arise where drains are blocked or damaged and they may, in very many cases, not be the direct responsibility of the householder where the damage or blockage occurs. Usually several houses are served by a single drainage pipe (a  \"combined drain\" ). In such cases the Corporation suggest that Residents Associations bring to the notice of their members their joint liability for any charges connected with the clearance of blockages, obstructions or other remedial works. \n While the Corporation do not provide a drains repair or clearance service there are several reputable well established firms who do so. \n Perhaps you would be good enough to bring this matter to the attention of the members of your Association. \n Yours sincerely,  L.

Persons making objections or representations will be allowed to state their case. Clarification may be sought on various points. There will not be any cross-examination, as the emphasis will be on informality throughout. \n After the oral hearings, a report and recommendation will be submitted to An Coisde Plean&/ala agus Forbairte in the first instance.

The general purpose of purchasing houses for letting as Corporation tenancy dwellings is to achieve a social mix in the districts concerned. The possible purchase of any house throughout the Corporation 's administrative area is considered within that context and within the context of how many other houses the Corporation has already agreed to purchase in any given area for the purpose of this scheme. \n I wish to confirm that these houses like all Corporation dwellings are allocated to people strictly in accordance with the Scheme of Letting Priorities as adopted by the City Council and approved by the Minister for the Environment. Accordingly, it is not true to say that the Corporation is allocating houses purchased under this scheme to tenants  \"who have proved unsuitable in Corporation estates\".  \n I would like to point out that the fact of the matter is that in the past 2 years the Corporation has purchased in excess of 150 houses and there has not been any problems with any of the tenants who were granted tenancies of these houses, nor is it anticipated that there will be any problem in this regard in the future. \n Yours faithfully, SEAMUS FOLEY SENIOR STAFF OFFICER", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "fd239d70-ef3c-458b-bb27-3f72fea3cd85", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.556959+00:00"}

That seemed to us a massively inappropriate step, particularly offensive to those applicants, or potential applicants, for Fellowship who may consider their achievements at least equal to those of some existing Fellows. \n In the event, the numerical limit was not imposed, and our thirteen new Fellows include some under-represented areas and categories in College. This benign development needs to be taken much further over the coming year, so that the next election of Fellows may represent a new departure. \n The current configuration of Fellowship has a number of drawbacks. Rather than stimulating a sense of commitment to research and the academic life, it suggests to the non-Fellow majority among the teaching staff that (for reasons which are not always apparent) we are considered \"inferior\" to certain of our colleagues, and something less than full members of College. Thus, it undermines the very real fellowship on which the work of our academic community depends. As well as being invidious and divisive, the current arrangements may even be counterproductive in terms of research; annual competitions may not bring out the best in everybody. And the present shape of Fellowship preserves, in fossilised form, a number of historical injustices - for example, College 's failure, over the years, to encourage the career development of women academics on an equal footing with men. \n Some of the more striking distortions in the present pattern of Fellowship are set out in Appendix 2 of the ASA submission to the Comprehensive Academic Review Committee, a copy of which I enclose. \n The ASA warmly welcomes your initiative in launching that Review. As you will see, we have tried to make our own contribution as constructive as possible, and we look forward to a wide-ranging debate, involving everybody in College, once the Committee has had time to consider all the views which it has received. We believe that the Academic Review should lead on to a thorough-going reappraisal of all College structures. \n With best wishes,\nYours sincerely Cormac &/O Cuillean&/ain Chairperson, Academic Staff Association \n\n\n<$A>\n DEPARTMENT OF ITALIAN TRINITY COLLEGE DUBLIN 2 \n Prof T.N. Mitchell Provost No. 1 College \n 19 December 1995 \n SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT IN HANDLING PROMOTION APPLICATIONS \nDear Provost, Recent Council minutes have noted that the criteria for promotion to higher grades are being considered by a sub-committee of the Personnel Committee and are to be forwarded to Council for approval at its first meeting in Hilary Term. Actum 14/C states that  \"as relevant staff were normally written to at the end of November, they would be informed that the criteria were under review and that revised criteria would be issued well in advance of the submission date\".  (I haven't in fact received any communication about this, as a relevant staff member; perhaps the publication of Council minutes is considered to be adequate notification.) \n This letter intended to address not the substantive criteria for promotion, but the manner in which candidates for promotion are handled. As, in the nature of things, many applications will have to be rejected, I think that you should give careful consideration to how the whole process might be handled in ways which avoid devaluing the staff members concerned. \n (You may have read these suggestions before; in June 1994, when I was the outgoing Chairperson of the ASA, I submitted them to the Staff Secretary with a request that they be considered by the Senior Promotions Committee at its first meeting of 1994/95 before invitations to apply were sent out. Having heard nothing further, I presumed that the suggestions were not in fact considered, since at least some of them seem non-controversial, and I would have expected to receive some sort of reply.) \n 1.  Candidates should be individually warned about all current restrictions when being invited to apply for promotion.  \n I would cite my own experience in support of this suggestion. In 1993/94, when I first came up for promotion to Senior Lectureship, the reason for rejection reported to me by the Dean of my Faculty was that all first-time applicants were automatically excluded from consideration. If that was the policy - and there could be good reasons for such a policy - then I should have been told this before going to the bother of drafting a lengthy, self-congratulatory application. \n 2  Gratuitous insults should be avoided.  \n A good promotions system would combine such qualities as transparency, credibility and tact, so as to reward the most productive people and also minimise the inevitable negative effects on disappointed candidates. \n In 1993/94, 21 lecturers applied for promotion to Senior Lectureship. Only 7 were promoted. Ideally, the unsuccessful 14 should have been able to console themselves by reflecting that no doubt the criteria had been fairly applied, the best people had been chosen, and College was doing its best within the financial constraints. \n On this last point, there was a general caution in the invitation to apply which was sent to eligible candidates:  \"The number of posts in this grade may be limited by financial considerations and it may not always be possible to offer posts even to suitable candidates.\"  That is, among other things, a nice way of reassuring rejected candidates that they are not necessarily undervalued by the institution. Tactful encouragement of this kind is all the more necessary as the current Fellowship system suggests to many academics that they are somehow second-class citizens of College. \n Unfortunately, a wildly counter-productive message was sent to disappointed candidates by Minute 70/A of Council, 9 March 1994:\n Arising from a question the Senior Lecturer advised Council that in the application of the three criteria for promotion appropriate to Senior Lectureship - research and publications, teaching and contribution to College [ - ] in which it was required by the committee that candidates have a satisfactory record in all categories the Senior Promotions Committee felt that there were only seven persons who could be recommended for promotion this year even though the Board had indicated that it would receive recommendations for up to ten senior lecturer promotions. \nThis was an emphatic (and, as we will see below, ill-founded) rebuff to rejected candidates. Only 7 out of 21 candidates were deemed to have  \"a satisfactory record\"  in relation to the criteria - in other words, College had the money for more promotions, but all the other applicants were sub-standard. Which leads me to suggest that particular care should be taken to avoid gratuitous insults when candidates may justifiably suspect that cost-cutting is masquerading as quality control. \n Besides, the  \"satisfactory record\"  criterion reported to Council by the Senior Lecturer was simply incompatible with the  \"automatic exclusion of first-timers\"  criterion reported to me by the Dean of my Faculty, for the obvious reason that some first-timers might be perfectly satisfactory. \nAll of which leads to my third suggestion:\n 1  Careless and inaccurate reporting should be avoided.  \n This might be best achieved by issuing written decisions (see below) and checking them for consistency. In 1993/94, for example, there was a glaring discrepancy between the eight published criteria for Senior Lectureship and the three criteria minuted in the Senior Lecturer 's report to Council. The eight published criteria [numbers added] were as follows:\n At this level a balanced view of a candidate 's standing in terms of [1] length of service, [2] teaching, [3] research, [4] administration and contributions to [5] learned societies and [6] public Bodies as well as to, [7,8] College and community activities will be taken. \n Even if one allows for compression in the minutes, the Senior Lecturer 's three reported criteria -  \"research and publications, teaching and contribution to College\"  - cannot be taken as including the  \"contributions to learned societies and public Bodies ... and community activities\"  which appeared in the published criteria. And if the report to Council seems arbitrarily to exclude some criteria, a disappointed candidate might feel uncertain as to whether the criteria in general had been properly taken into account by the Committee. Such uncertainty would be compounded by shortcomings in the system for reporting the reasons for rejection to disappointed candidates. The purely verbal basis of this - where Deans are given the unenviable task of explaining - leaves the way open for misunderstandings. One colleague, who was rejected on several occasions, recalled that a different reason was given each year, and the variety soon ceased to amuse. Therefore: \n 1  The Senior Promotions Committee should provide all candidates with a brief written reason for its decision.  \n Such a written explanation - which could be supplemented by verbal explanations from the Dean - would also help to remind the Committee of its decisions in the following year, thereby aiding consistency and fairness. It would also avoid the possibility of candidates first learning of their rejection from reading Council minutes on e-mail, as happened to me in 1994/95 (although at least the minutes contained no disinformation on that occasion). \n 2  The Senior Promotions Committee should take account of candidates' effective opportunities to meet the eight published criteria.  \n Candidates and their Heads of Department might receive specific advice on this point. For example, the criteria for Senior Lectureship include the category of \"administration\". Some Heads of Department may consciously or unconsciously marginalise certain members of staff, who may thereby be unfairly denied the administrative responsibilities which would otherwise have strengthened their case for promotion. \n Similarly, some candidates might be disadvantaged by practices prevailing in their areas. For example, in an area where no teaching quality surveys had been held, it would not be possible for candidates to provide evidence of their perceived quality as teachers, were such a criterion to be introduced. \n 1  There should be an effective appeals system for candidates who are unhappy about decisions affecting them.  \n In practice, a more transparent and \"informative\" system would probably forestall any sense of unfairness in most cases, but a conventional method of seeking redress should exist all the same. Such an appeal process might work simply by inviting disappointed candidates to send their views in writing to yourself, as Provost, if they felt that their treatment had been in any way unsatisfactory. You might then invite the appellant for a brief interview, perhaps attended also by the Faculty Dean. A courteous hearing and exchange of views might do much to clear the air and identify issues for resolution, either immediately or over time. An appeal lodged in this way would be a \"normal\" step, not necessarily implying any antagonism towards the Committee. \n Do you think that these suggestions might be looked at when the revised criteria for promotion come to be ratified? I should emphasise that although the suggestions are illustrated partly from my own experience, they mostly derive from comments made to me by colleagues who were to some extent losing confidence in the promotion system. \n This is not a life-or-death issue. At a time when talented junior colleagues are increasingly being employed on dead-end contracts, it may seem selfish to fret about the sensitive handling of more privileged people. All the same, a little quality improvement in this area of College life might yield valuable results. \n With thanks for your attention, Yours sincerely Cormac &/O Cuillean&/ain", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "88866529-50f5-43ae-b01c-4aedd6fe2157", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.558728+00:00"}
{"text": "<IFUT letters>\n\n\n<$A>\n 5th March, 1991   Mrs Mary O'Rourke, T.D., Minister for Education Department of Education Marlborough Street Dublin1. \n Dear Minister,\n   The Future Structure of the National University of Ireland\n\nIntroduction   \n When the representatives of the University were received by you on 23 January 1990, you confirmed that consideration of future structures could proceed on the basis that, whatever choice was made, there would be no diminution of autonomy in relation to appointments and the general conduct of university business. You suggested that the University 's preferred option should be brought forward as soon as possible. \n It is now possible to summarise the outcome of the consideration given to the matter by the three Constituent Colleges, St Patrick 's College, Maynooth (a Recognised College) and the Senate of the University. The reports of the four Colleges are given in full in the Appendix to this letter. \n   General approach   \n Despite differences as to the extent and degree of change desired, it is the common preference of the four Colleges to remain constituent elements of a NUI system but each with the status and title of a university and a significant redistribution in its favour of powers and functions. This would mean that, while the corpus of existing legislation, charters and statutes would be preserved, amendments would need to be effected by new legislation with the principal object of transferring certain powers and functions at present exercised by the Senate of NUI to the appropriate bodies of the constituent universities, with the Senate retaining residual responsibilities regarding appointments procedures and standards of degrees and diplomas. The following paragraphs set out the consensus arrived at by the Senate on particular aspects of this general approach. \n   Status and Title   \n (i)The present three Constituent Colleges, while retaining all their existing powers and functions, should become constituent universities of the National University of Ireland and be entitled in Irish and English, respectively: <&Irish> Ollscoil na h&/Eireann, Baile &/Atha Claith </&Irish> The National University of Ireland, Dublin <&Irish> Ollscoil na h&/Eireann, Corcaigh </&Irish> The National University of Ireland, Cork <&Irish> Ollscoil na h&/Eireann, Gaillimh </&Irish> The National University of Ireland, Galway \n (ii) St Patrick 's College, Maynooth, in its faculties or arts, celtic studies, philosophy and science, should become a constituent university of the National University of Ireland and be entitled in Irish and English, respectively:\n<&Irish> Ollscoil na h&/Eireann, M&/a Nuad </&Irish> The National University of Ireland, Maynooth\n Appropriate provision should be made for representation of the Senate of NUI on the Governing Body and vice-versa. \n (iii) The constituent universities may extend the above titles in a manner which indicates that they are successors to a specified Constituent or Recognised College or that they are constituent universities of the National University of Ireland. \n   Transfer of Power and Functions   \n (i) Provision should be made specifically in legislation for the amendment of the Irish Universities Act, 1908, and associated Charters so as to effect the transfer of powers and functions from the Senate of the NUI to the appropriate bodies of the respective constituent universities which is described below under the headings of Appointments, and Courses and Standards for Degrees and Diplomas. \n (ii) Provision should also be made for flexibility in authorising future agreed evolution of the relations between the NUI and its constituent universities. This could be achieved by providing that further changes in powers and functions proposed by the NUI on the recommendation or with the agreement of the constituent university(ies) could be statutorily authorised, subject to ratification (passive or active) by both Houses of the Oireachtas. \n   Internal Procedures   \n To afford them operational flexibility, constituent universities should be empowered (notwithstanding any restriction in existing legislation) to make by way of university statute, after consultation with the Senate of NUI, such changes as might be decided by the relevant Governing Body in the internal organisation or procedures of that university. Such statute should have effect when it had lain before both Houses of the Oireachtas for a prescribed period without being annulled. \n   Appointments   \n (i) Persons who at present hold posts in the Colleges which are to become constituent universities, whether appointed thereto by the relevant College authority or by the Senate of the NUI, should be confirmed as holders of equivalent posts, without disimprovement in terms, conditions or entitlements, in the relevant constituent universities. \n (ii) Persons who hold permanent academic posts to which they were appointed by the Governing Body of a Constituent College, should become lecturers of the relevant constituent university and, without prejudice to grades or salary scales, enjoy the advantages possessed by lecturers appointed by the Senate of the NUI, as regards tenure, membership of the Academic Council and the holding of any other office or responsibility in the constituent university. \n (iii) Each constituent university should have the power to appoint its own staff but, in relation to permanent academic staff, including the President, and academic staff appointed for a fixed term of years, appointments should be made only in accordance with such appointments procedure as might be approved from time to time by the Senate of the NUI either generally or in particular categories or cases. These appointments should be provisional for the first month and then become effective unless within the month an objection, on the basis of alleged non-conformity with the approved procedure, were made by an interested party to the relevant Governing Body, and reported to the Registrar of NUI. Pending resolution of the objection (within, say, two months at the outside), the appointment should remain provisional. (The basic element in the appointments procedure to be approved by the Senate of the NUI would be an appropriately constituted assessment board including an external expert or external experts). \n (iv) Persons who, in accordance with paragraphs (i) - (iii) above, hold appointments as Professors, Readers or Lecturers in constituent universities shall also, so long as they hold these appointments, be Professors, Readers or Lecturers, respectively, of the National University of Ireland. \n (v) The functions of the Senate of NUI regarding removal from office of persons to whom paragraphs (i) - (iii) refer should pass to the relevant constituent universities, subject to the right of appeal to the Visitor. \n   Courses and Standards for Degrees and Diplomas   \n The constituent universities should establish their own degree and diploma courses, set their own marks and standards and, in consultation with the relevant external examiners, set their own examinations. The courses so established would be subject, from time to time, to review by an academic committee of the Senate of NUI, after consultation with the relevant external examiners. Any comments resulting from such periodic review would be communicated to the constituent universities for their consideration. The present General Board of Studies should be abolished. \n   External Examiners   \n External examiners should continue to be appointed by the Senate of NUI on the agreed recommendation of the constituent universities, with appropriate functions, including the additional function indicated in the preceding paragraph, but with flexibility as to the manner of discharging these functions. \n  Degrees and Diplomas   \n The degrees and diplomas awarded by the constituent universities should be degrees and diplomas of the National University of Ireland and should be so designated. \n   Entrance requirements for students   \n The Senate should continue to approve basic matriculation conditions for the NUI system as a whole. The constituent universities would be free to prescribe additional requirements for entry to particular faculties. \n   Recognised Colleges   \n Provision should continue to exist for third-level educational establishments to be associated with a constituent university and to be designated as Recognised Colleges of the NUI. \n   Theology (or Religious Studies)   \n Abolition is recommended of those provisions of Section 7 of the 1908 Act which prohibit the public funding of 'any theological or religious teaching or study' and, even where private funding is involved, lay down other restrictions. \n >  Finance   \n Funding of the NUI itself (as distinct from the constituent universities) should be mainly by the charging of appropriate fees (e.g. in relation to matriculation, degrees and diplomas). Supplemental public funding should be provided for. \n   Effect of Proposals   \n These proposals would confer the status and title of universities on U.C.D., U.C.C., U.C.G., and St. Patrick 's College, Maynooth, and transfer to them wide-ranging discretion to conduct their own affairs. The National University of Ireland, which has played a historically significant role in national education and development, would continue to provide an important public service. In its co-ordinating role the NUI, acting through its head-office and its Senate, would be concerned with the maintenance of appropriate university entrance standards and the highest international standing for degrees and diplomas. It would also provide assurance of impartiality and excellence in academic appointments and would be a forum for consideration of developmental policies in education in Ireland and in the evolving European Community. \n >  Conclusion   \n It is hoped that the proposals will commend themselves to you and the Government and that a decision will be taken to introduce legislation accordingly to amend the 1908 Act and associated Charters. Officers of the University are considering the particular amendments required and will be glad to assist in the formulation of appropriate heads of a bill. \n It would be appreciated if representatives of the University could have a preliminary meeting with you soon for any clarification you may desire and for a general discussion of the proposals. \n Yours sincerely, Kenneth Whitaker Chancellor \n\n\n<$B>\n TO: All Affiliated Organisations in the Republic \n January 1991 \n PENSIONS ACT, 1990 \n Dear Colleague, The Pensions Act, 1990 came into force on 1 January, 1991 and its operation will lead to substantial improvements in pension practice over the forthcoming years. Enclosed is an explanatory booklet prepared by the Department of Social Welfare summarising the main provisions of the new legislation. Also enclosed is a separate guide to the Disclosure of Information Regulations which has been prepared by Congress. \n Congress would like to draw your attention to a number of key points in the new Act. Also, we would like to alert you to a recent negative trend in pensions practice which should be brought to the attention of trade union officials involved in pension negotiations. \n (i)  Worker Trustees  \n The Minister for Social Welfare is committed to introducing Regulations for the appointment of member trustees by January 1994. However, in the meantime every effort should be made to convince employers that progress can and should be made before that date. In the absence of member trustees, Unions should seek the establishment and recognition of  Pension Committees  with provision for appropriate training for Committee members. \n (ii)  Pensions Board  \n In the event of a dispute with the trustees of a scheme or with an employer over the provisions of the Pensions Act, the application of the rules of the scheme or where malpractice is suspected, the Union can now refer the dispute to the Pensions Board which has a statutory duty to investigate the matter and propose and implement remedies. \n (iii)  Dilution of Pension Benefits; 'Defined Contribution Scheme'  \n It has come to the attention of Congress that some employers have been\nattempting to convert the normal occupational pension scheme known as a 'defined\nbenefit scheme' to another less favourable form of scheme i.e. a 'defined contribution\nscheme'. It must be pointed out that this is motivated solely to  escape the\nprovisions of the Pensions Act  and in almost every conceivable case a 'defined\ncontribution scheme' will be  less  favourable in terms of members' benefit\nthan a 'defined benefit scheme'. Congress is advising union negotiators to oppose\nthis development and advise scheme members to refuse in writing to accept the\nwinding up of their existing scheme, and to refer the matter to the Pensions Board.\n\n Further queries on this matter should be referred to Stephen McCarthy, Industrial Officer at this office. \n Yours sincerely, Peter Cassells General Secretary \n\n\n<$C>\n Mr Daltun O'Ceallaigh, General Secretary, Irish Federation of University Teachers, 11, Merrion Square, Dublin 2. \n 5th June, 1990. \n Re:  Expenses Allowances.

{"text": "<TCD - Moving house>\n\n\n<$A>\n 7th March, 1991 Mr. J. Hayden, Secretary, Higher Education Authority, 21 Fitzwilliam Square, Dublin 2. \n Dear Mr, Hayden, I enclose a document on 'Duration of Courses' as I promised you earlier this week. \n You will see that the College is firmly opposed to a reduction in course length of its existing four-year degrees. The reasons are set out in the accompanying document, but I would like to emphasise that we are now in a period of intense focus on European integration. We point out that our present procedures are more consistent with European practice and future validation requirements than is true of three-year courses. We also point out that a change to three-year courses would be slow to implement and would probably raise the percentage drop-outs to a point where very little practical advantage in throughput could be obtained. \n We see advantages in the proposals relating to a 2 <*> plus sign </*> 2 year degree which I believe are favoured by the Secretary of the Department of Education. We are willing to discuss this more extensively with him and with the HEA. The advantages lie in the necessity to structure our courses for purposes of external recognition and for student exchanges, especially within the ERASMUS programmes. We would also be interested in structures which would make possible a change of emphasis or direction for students after an initial two-year period of instruction. \n We ask the HEA and the Department to take notice of the undertakings given by An Taoiseach when questions of university education were discussed with him in the last two years. It was a condition stated by him that the introduction of a new system of financing the universities would be accompanied by the freedom of universities to manage their internal affairs. You will know that this university has already prepared its first set of unit costings which will be available to the HEA after consultation with our colleagues in the other Colleges. We consider that the management of our own resources, which was part of the undertaking given to us by An Taoiseach, extends to our decision as to how our resources should be used in course structure and duration. You will no doubt have the various speeches of An Taoiseach on this subject available to you but they were taken very seriously by the universities. \n Finally, I have on previous occasions expressed my concern and disquiet at failure within Government Departments, not necessarily the HEA or the Department of Education, to recognise the professionalism and experience that exists within the universities. It is not acceptable to us that our procedures, based on long evolution and experience, should be set aside in favour of the opinions of people who offer us no discussion and whose qualifications to decide on university coursework are unknown to us. \n Yours sincerely, W.

{"text": "<Unionist myths>\n\n\n<$A>\n UNIONIST MYTHS 1912-1985 \n Alvin Jackson I \n The events of 1912-14 in Ireland have served as a creation myth for Unionism in the twentieth century - as a kind of Orange Genesis. Shaped and strengthened by the patriarchs Edward Carson and James Craig  1 , Unionism survived political challenge from a serpentine H. H. Asquith and reappeared, with the steeples of Tyrone and Fermanagh, from the deluge of the Great War. The Unionist rulers of Northern Ireland saw in the issues and personalities of 1912-14 an important moral prop in the same way as varieties of nationalist have sought to cultivate the legacies of Wolfe Tone or Padraig Pearse, and varieties of English commentator have sought retroactive definitions of the Glorious Revolution. 2  \n Carson has emerged as an Orange icon, a fact recognised in a literal sense in the diptych painted by Joseph McWilliams; he has emerged as an Orange Daniel O'Connell,  \"the saviour of his tribe\"  - protecting the least of his people from British betrayal, unifying and mobilizing his community in a uniquely thorough manner.  3  The emotional bond between this latter-day Counsellor and his following, a bond well captured in Gerald Dawe 's poem \"A Question of Covenants\", was of a peculiarly intense quality: mill-women kissed his hand; country squires treated him with an exaggerated reverence.  4  The emotional charge of Ulster Day, 28 September 1912, when thousands gathered at Belfast city hall to oppose Home Rule, long persisted in the northern folk memory. It is an ironic testimony to the potency of this image that contemporary Unionists, in organising their first major demonstration against the Anglo-Irish Agreement, should have chosen precisely the same location as their forefathers, opposing an earlier act of ministerial \"treachery\", did in 1912. Photographs taken from the dome of the city hall in 1985 consciously mimic the sepia images of 1912.  5  Ian Paisley plays Carson to James Molyneaux 's Craig: both invoke the men of 1912 in legitimizing their creed. The mythology of 1912-14 is therefore a central feature of latter-day Unionism, with memories of Edwardian derring-do remaining alive and relevant, and with the actions of the Edwardian leadership generating a still complete respect and reverence. \n Nevertheless, just as the reputation of O'Connell was illuminated in different ways, depending on the needs of nineteenth-century Irish nationalism,  6  so Carson and the men of 1912 have been examined from different perspectives, and exploited in different forms. Successive generations of Unionist, and successive forms of Unionism, embrace different aspects of the myth, even if all tacitly agree in looking back to 1912-14 for whatever form of legitimization they seek. Unionist chroniclers and propagandists, beginning with Ronald Mc Neill in 1922, accepted that this was a period of unique internal unity within northern Unionism, a period when the cohesion of Unionism and between Unionism and its allies was pretty well complete. The Protestant clergy, women and children were politicized, and were bound into organized or active Unionism as never before: the young C. S. Lewis, cocooned in suburban loyalism, was writing essays on the Home Rule question from the age of ten, on the eve of the constitutional crisis. 8  An Ulster Women 's Unionist Council was first formed in 1911, and was quickly followed by local offspring.  9  Generally the numbers of men and women responding to their leaders were unprecedented: just under 500,000 signed the Ulster Covenant; some 100,000 were (nominally) recruited to the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force (U.V.F.). \n English Conservative sanction was as apparently thorough as it was astonishing: when Andrew Bonar Law made his fiery Blenheim pledge in July 1912, Craig was as startled as English commentators with a rather more vigorous sense of political morality.  10  English Conservatives of the second rank, like Sir William Bull, actively promoted Ulster Unionist gunrunning; first-rank Tories such as Walter Long, even possibly Bonar Law himself, approve the mass importation of weapons into Larne, Country Antrim, at a preliminary stage.  11  \n Here, then, was a period apparently characterized by organizational and strategic success - a period when the Unionist leadership was as unequivocal as its following. There was no perception of moral greyness, no reprehensible ambiguity. Moreover Unionists did not, ultimately, have to follow through the implications of their own behaviour: in August 1914, with the outbreak of the Great War, they could back away from the precipice in a more credible fashion than marked their later retreats from vulgar bluster. The chasm was reached only with the first battle of the Somme, when fears of annihilation, of race death, came close to fulfilment - though in circumstances very different to those envisioned before the war. Set against the carnage of the Great War, and against the more modest brutalities of the Troubles, the struggle against Home Rule appeared as heroic without being bloody. And, in retrospect, the combination of threatened militancy at Larne, and the actual immolation at the Somme, had served to prepare the way for partition and for a Unionist   heimat:   the Government of Ireland Act, the foundation of Northern Ireland, could be credibly interpreted as a tangible reward for their political investment before and during the Great War. Kenneth Pyper, the protagonist of Frank McGuinness 's  Observe the Sons of Ulster,  was not alone in seeing, even in his despair, a logical progression between the U.V.F., their role on the Somme and the later struggles of Unionism.  12  \n This article explores the historical perspectives of modern Unionism, and the bond between this vision of the past and contemporary Unionist action. The argument is divided into three principal sections. First, the resonance of Unionist actions in 1912-14 is charted: the ways in which the popular memory of 1912-14 was cultivated and the importance of Unionist imagery from the period are both examined. Secondly, one episode in the period - the gunrunning coup of April 1914 - is isolated in order both to illustrate some of the broader themes of the article, and to compare popular and official memories with available historical evidence. The article closes with a variety of reflections on the interrelationship between the loyalist past and the loyalist present, and on the ways in which contemporary Unionism is illuminated through an exploration of its historical consciousness. \n II \n Little wonder that Unionists should have returned to 1912 in piety, and with a sense of nostalgia for what, for them, was a more vital and coherent political faith. The increasingly confident governors of Northern Ireland saw Carson and Craig as statebuilders, and perceived themselves as the sole legatees of these men. Their reputations were bitterly guarded. Carson chose a judicial career in England rather than office in Northern Ireland, but his contribution to Unionism, and to the North, did not go unattested.  13  His occasional visits won lavish press coverage. A reverential literature was consolidated, culminating in Edward Marjoribanks and Ian Colvin 's triple-decker \"life\" of 1932-6. Carson was actively involved in the manufacture of his own mythology, supplying forewords to Unionist publications and co-operating in the Marjoribanks and Colvin project: indeed he was so pleased with this biography that he was prepared to distribute inscribed copies of the first two volumes to his intimates.  14  When he died in 1935 there was a state funeral in Belfast, and an ornate memorial in St. Anne 's Church of Ireland cathedral. He was given a statue, cast in an appropriately defiant pose and placed in front of the Stormont parliament building. He was in competition with Queen Elizabeth II when the Belfast city fathers were considering how to name their new bridge across the Lagan in 1965  15  Craig gained lapidary immortality in the form of a bridge - in this case over the Foyle in Derry - and through the name of the new town linking Portadown and Lurgan in North Armagh. He, too, had successive literary apologists: Hugh Shearman in 1942, and St. John Ervine in 1949.  16  \n Generations of Unionist politicians have vindicated themselves through genuflecting to the men of 1912. In the later 1960s this became less a matter of celebrating the Northern Irish state through celebrating its founders and more thoroughly a matter of seeking legitimacy  within  Unionism. With the movement threatening to disintegrate, to revert to its constituent parts, rival Unionist sects sought to annex the Carson mystique and thereby to consolidate their claims over the tradition as a whole. This is partly why Terence O'Neill 's experimental Unionism in the 1960s was marketed as much by reference to the perceived legacy of the men of 1912 as by reference to any more universal principle: in arguing for a progressive Unionism in 1965 O'Neill warned that  \"no one anywhere [should] make the mistake of thinking that because there is talk of a new Ulster that the Ulster of Carson and Craig is dead.\"  17   \n Yet, surprising as it seems, and despite O'Neill 's repeated references to the Unionist patriarchs, this mistake  was  made. It was precisely because O'Neill deviated from the familiar in other respects that Ian Paisley could appeal with increasing persuasiveness to fundamentalist Unionism, and could credibly invoke the achievement of Carson. Paisley courted Carson 's son, the bewildered Edward Carson Junior, deploying him in election campaigns in February 1965.  18  When Paisley opened his Free Presbyterian cathedral, the Martyrs ' Memorial Church in east Belfast, a monument to Carson was erected in a conspicuous position at the front of the building. In a nicely symbolic incident in 1967 Paisley used the cover of Carson 's statue at Stormont to snowball the car of the Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, then paying a courtesy visit to O'Neill.  19  In November 1985 Paisley, opposing the Anglo-Irish Agreement, concluded his peroration at Belfast city hall with Carson 's view of the rights of citizenship.  20", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "01a52cfd-6e38-41d3-b17f-7c8292928d9f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.561428+00:00"}
{"text": "<Broadside ballads>\n\n\n<$A>\n  Broadside Ballads and Irish Society: An Examination of the Themes of Religion and Love  \n  Colin Neilands  \n The cultural contextualisation of broadside ballads, certainly within Ireland, has received relatively little, and only selective, attention to date. Such treatment as there is has focused for the most part on political or historical themes. Since these are the major themes of Irish broadside output (see Table One), they obviously merit examination, but what of the broadsides with other themes? \n This article seeks to interweave social history as portrayed in the ballads, with that presented by more \"conventional\" historical sources, i.e. historical textbooks. This is not in itself a novel approach, as it has been employed, for example, in the many works of Roy Palmer  2 , and was also attempted with an Irish context in Mulcahy and Fitzgibbons '  The Voice of the People.   3  However, the difficulty with this approach is that often authors have taken history as their starting-point and simply used the ballads to illustrate or exemplify; with the vast range in ballad material available, it is not difficult to find suitable examples. But what of the opposite direction - i.e. taking the ballads as the starting point and then turning to history to give them points of reference? If the ballads are  \"the voice of the people\" , as in Mulcahy and Fitzgibbons ' book, surely they must be the first point of reference. In this approach, we are able to see which issues, events, or figures were judged important by \"the people\" (however they are to be defined) and then relate these to the mainstream perception of history to draw out points of comparison. \n Ballads, perhaps particularly broadside ballads, having an origin and audience primarily from a very different part of society from that producing scholarly historical works, obviously present a different perspective on a country 's history. With increasing awareness of the narrowness of a conventional historical perspective, a wider variety of alternative sources has come to be employed in an attempt to perceive life from the point of view of the majority, rather than a minority. The use of such sources not only reveals a different conception of the importance of events and people, but places political history in a broader context, where it is much less dominant. With this alternative approach, history is not solely about political happenings at home and abroad, but presents a much wider picture encompassing many more aspects of life of more constant and immediate concern to the majority of the population - economic problems, the family, love relationships, entertainment, etc. \n The use of broadside ballads as such a source for examining nineteenth-century Ireland reveals that while political history may be the largest overall theme, it still accounts for only one in four out of the total (see Table One below). This article examines two of the other broadside themes - religion and love - which focus on issues which are central to the life of any nation or community. \n  Table 1: Thematic Distribution - Occurrences and Percentages  \n\n  Ballads on Religion and Belief  4   \n The nineteenth century is usually viewed as the period when the Catholic Church really came to the fore as a dominant, shaping force in Irish life, especially after the Emancipation Act of 1829. The Church increasingly sought to exercise its control over the lives of the people, as well as identifying still further with nationalist politics. This was a period of great growth for the Church when many of the practices and institutions which are now an intrinsic part of the faith were first introduced. Because of all this activity and the increasing pervasiveness of the Church throughout the island, and in all aspects of life, religious history has much to say on this period.  5  For the broadsides, however, the Church, and matters relating, appear to have evoked less of an interest. \n That broadside ballads on religion and belief have received little attention then, may not be altogether surprising as they seem to form only about seven percent of the total broadside output.  6  This figure appears to indicate a popular interest somewhat at odds with what has been termed  \"the devotional revolution\"   7  which occurred in Ireland in the nineteenth century. However, the fact that such ballads occurred at all, particularly in a medium generally held in low esteem, is perhaps an indication of the strength of religious fervour in Ireland during the last century, such that it penetrated all strata of society and utilised all manner of media of expression. These religious ballads fall into four main categories - on Churches (i.e. buildings), on the Clergy, on Faith, and on the Supernatural - and these categories have been used for the statistical analysis presented in Table Two (see following page). \n For the purposes of this article the material in these broadsides will be discussed under two general categories - the Church, and Belief - each accounting for roughly half of the total number of 179 broadsides on the general theme. \n The two main areas of interest of the broadsides with regard to the Church as an institution were the construction or renovation of church buildings, and the clergy. The first of these inspired only nine broadsides, despite appearing to graphically illustrate the changing fortunes of the Church and surely evoking pride on the part of the parishioners involved. The building programme was quite extensive and would have had a marked effect on the worship of a large number of Catholics throughout Ireland. The change in the appearance of church buildings was often quite dramatic, with parishes formerly worshipping in a low, thatched construction, similar to ordinary dwellings, now blessed with architecturally designed dressed-stone buildings, often in a Gothic style. The ballads themselves enthuse as to the beauties of these new edifices and the related glory of the clergy, the Church, and God (see \"A New Song in Praise of the Catholic Church of Kanturk\"). But the low number of broadsides suggests that other issues were of greater interest to the people. \n  Table 2: Broadside Ballads on Religion and Belief - Occurrences and Percentages   \n If the broadsides are to be believed, the single most important manifestation of the Church was the parish priest, with ballads on the clergy (mostly at parish priest level, though occasionally rising to bishop) accounting for almost half the broadsides on this theme (eighty out of 179, as indicated in Table Two above). The predominance of the priest as a broadside subject is also reflective of nineteenth-century changes as a rise in the social standing of the priesthood and improved education facilities led to an increase in the number of priests available for service, so that parishes no longer had to go without, or make do with poorly-educated, perhaps even rather uninterested, clergy. These changes also led to greater centralised control over the activities and performance of parish priests even in far-flung corners of the country. Increasingly the priest became the focal point of the local community, acting as an important social as well as religious symbol for his parishioners. It is therefore not surprising that such a figure should have been the inspiration for popular song. \n For the most part, the ballads on priests are praise songs, either eulogies or elegies, conforming to the stereotype images which were prevalent throughout various forms of popular literature at that time.  8  The clergy were painted in terms placing them on the celestial scale only slightly lower than the saints or angels, as ideal(ised) servants of God on earth (see \"An Elegy on the Death of the Much Lamented Doctor D.M. O'Brien\"). The only incident inspiring broadside treatment which pours anything but the highest praise on the Catholic Clergy was the case of the turncoat bishop, when, in 1786, John Butler, the Bishop of Cork, abandoned the Catholic faith in order to inherit a title and estates denied him under the terms of the Penal Laws. This sensational incident appears to have remained in the folk mind for some time, in that the two broadsides based on this occurrence are clearly of nineteenth century origin. \n Since the priests had such a high social standing and public image, it is not surprising that when unusual circumstances did occur, these should merit broadside attention - whether it was a murder, or a sensational trial, with sexual accusations. If based on actual events, as was probably the case, none of these would have been common occurrences, which only further explains the attention of the broadsides. After all, even in the secular times of our own age, it can still make headline news in the popular press if a member of the clergy is seen to, or is thought to, stray from the approved line. The broadsides, however, were always careful to emphasise the absolute innocence of the priests involved. While cashing in on the public desire for sensationalism, the broadside writers and printers had no wish, it seems, to actually discredit a member of the clergy. The shock of the scandal and the subsequent attention given to these unusual occurrences only serves to emphasise further the high level of interest in these public servants. \n The Church, then, while perhaps not inspiring a quantity of broadsides equal to its growing importance in nineteenth-century Ireland, is seen to have attracted great loyalty and devotion, particularly for its priests. The broadsides probably bring the reality of the Church for the people down to a more immediate level, revealing the personal impact of parish priests, who frequently acted as vital supports for their communities. The more abstract power and symbolism of the Church, as represented here by the church buildings, seem to have stirred lesser feelings. \n Turning to the second category of the broadsides - Belief - these ballads in turn divide in two: those covering aspects of the people 's belief system approved by the Church, and those on practices and beliefs not approved by the Church. \n Ballads on Church-approved matters of faith include stories based on the Bible, or on the lives of certain saints, declarations of faith, and denominational debates (the latter introducing the issue of interdenominational marriage). Some of the songs are very pious, almost prayers or hymns, rather out of keeping with the general tone and content of broadside ballads, and frequently of a higher than usual literary standard. The sensationalism of trails and murder, the topicality of praise songs and elegies, and the likely commercial popularity of attacks on Protestantism, all make obvious topics for broadsides, but ballads of purely religious content seem almost out of place in this medium. \n Most of the ballads based on Biblical stories depict the life of Christ, particularly the details surrounding His birth and death. Little or no attention is given to the teachings of Christ and no mention is made of one of the central tenets of Christian faith, namely, the resurrection. This concentration on the Passion and crucifixion of Christ, often described in graphic and gory detail (see \"On the Love of Jesus\"), may be a reflection of one of the many innovations in religious worship during the nineteenth century which was to become one of the most popular: the devotion of the Passion of the Sacred Heart.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "96fbdb07-7d3b-42fa-9756-10cfe57011b0", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.562344+00:00"}
{"text": "<Darwinism Calvinism>\n\n\n<$A>\n  DARWINISM AND CALVINISM The Belfast-Princeton Connection  \n   By David N. Livingstone   \n STUDENTS OF THE RELATIONSHIP between scientific thought and religious belief are now well acquainted with the broad contours of the encounter between Protestantism and Darwinism.  1  Thanks to the outline maps that recent historians of science have compiled, the major features of this landscape - at least for the English-speaking world - are now familiar territory, with the significance of natural theology, the standing of humankind, and the status of biblical criticism figuring prominently among the key conceptual landmarks. \n The cartographic image that I have chosen to refer to these developments usefully introduces the major aims of the present investigation. First, because there still remain many blank spaces on the science-religion map, I hope to chart a hitherto-unsurveyed stretch of terrain: the response of Belfast Calvinists to the Darwinian challenge. That this region has remained unexplored is surprising, I suggest, given the much-publicized speech of John Tyndall to the Belfast meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1874. That Tyndall 's presidential address provoked a spirited response from the religious community is well known, but the precise nature of that local reception remains  terra incognita.  \n My cartographic allusions, moreover, are more than merely decorative in a second way. The particularities of place have always been of significance to cartographers, and it is my contention that understanding the religious response to Darwin requires us to take seriously the historical  geography  of science and theology. By this I mean that local circumstances are at least as important as grand doctrinal themes in conditioning religious reactions to scientific claims. It is thus by reference to the specifics of geographical locality that I hope to make sense of the surprisingly different responses of orthodox Calvinists in Belfast and Princeton to the onslaught of evolutionary theory, notwithstanding the remarkable congruity of their doctrinal commitments. This approach, moreover, is in keeping with the recent merging of work in cultural geography and the historical sociology of science, the former elucidating the geography of knowledge that arises from the uneven distribution of scientific information, the latter portraying the character of the spaces (on a variety of scales) in which scientific knowledge is produced and the diffusion tracts along which both it and its attendant political power migrate.  2  Both conform to what has been called  \"an influential  localist  genre, marked by attention to national and regional features of an enterprise once regarded as paradigmatically universal.\"   3  \n  CALVINISM IN CRISIS  \n The Belfast Presbytery met for its monthly meeting on Wednesday, 2 September 1874. Rev. William Johnston, a recent moderator of the Presbyterian Church 's General Assembly, rose to address the gathering. The principles of Christianity, he began, had just been subjected to an  \"open and determined onslaught.\"  Two weeks ago that very day Professor John Tyndall had in the name of science assailed  \"Christianity in its vital parts.\"  It pained him, Johnston went on, to hear the professor thanked for his disquisition, and to discover, as had some of the newspapers, that  \"in Belfast such materialism and atheism [could be] propagated without any protest on the part of the audience who heard it.\"  But what bothered Johnston even more was the fact that while the British Association had pronounced its blessing on Tyndall 's speculations, that same body  \"had excluded a paper proposing to show how the inquiries of science could be conducted in thorough accordance with the principles of Christianity.\" \"Thereby,\"  he went on,  \"the Association made themselves a party to a one-sided attack on Christianity.\"  Cries of  \"Hear hear\"  from the assembled company indicated that he had touched a raw nerve among the Presbyterian ministers present. The paper to which Johnston referred had been prepared for the meeting of the association by the Presbyterian Assembly 's College professor of systematic theology, Rev. Dr. Robert Watts, and before concluding his comments Johnston  \"proceeded to eulogise\"  Watts 's endeavors.  4  \n Johnston had no intention of leaving the matter as a mere record of proceedings in the presbytery 's minute book. Some two weeks later he met with a number of fellow clergymen to lay plans for a course of evening lectures, to be given at Rosemary Street Church during the winter months, on the relationship between science and Christianity. In due course these addresses would be drawn together into a book, distributed on both sides of the Atlantic, entitled  Science and Revelation: A Series of Lectures in Reply to the Theories of Tyndall, Huxley, Darwin, Spencer, Etc.  and furnished with a preface by Johnston himself.  5  \n William Johnston was certainly not the only one irritated by Tyndall 's Belfast address. Tyndall himself had confided to a close friend that  \"every pulpit in Belfast thundered of me,\"  and a contemporary observer noted that  \"at no time since the Arian Controversy, has the religious mind of Ulster been so deeply and indignantly stirred.\"  The reasons for the commotion are clear: Tyndall 's speech was widely interpreted as perhaps the chief pronouncement of scientific materialism in the nineteenth century, though whether his stance is best typified as materialism or as something closer to a naturalistic pantheism is a matter of some dispute.  6  </#> To be sure, in his preface to a reprint of the address Tyndall made the following qualifying observation on the attacks to which he had been subjected: \n  They have lost their power to wound or injure. So likewise as regards a resolution recently passed by the Presbytery of Belfast in which Professor Huxley and myself are spoken of as  \"ignoring the existence of God, and advocating pure and simple materialism;\"  had the possessive pronoun  \"our\" preceded  \"God,\"  and had the words  \"what we consider\"  preceded  \"pure\" , this statement would have been objectively true; but to make it so this qualification is required.  \n Nevertheless, even if Tyndall felt that the Presbyterians ' dubbing of his stance as  \"pure and simple materialism\"  was too imprecise, there was no doubt that he had launched a frontal assault on teleology and Christian theism. He had begun by presenting his own history of the atomic theory since the time of Democritus, Epicurus, and Lucretius, suitably eliding those chapters in the story that did not serve his immediate purposes - namely, to show how science had progressively routed the forces of metaphysical dogma - and daring even to assault such scientific advocates of natural theology as Robert Boyle and Isaac Newton. He bolstered his argument that science had sustained materialism by calling upon the testimony of Darwinian biology, the conservation of energy, and the physiological basis of the nervous system. Nothing seemed excluded from the reign of science, for even the human species, Tyndall insisted, had been derived  \"in . . . totality from the inter-action of organism and environment.\"  The implications were plain. All  \"religious theories, schemes and systems which embrace notions of cosmogony . . . must . . . submit to the control of science, and relinquish all thought of controlling it.\"  7   \n However pugnacious Tyndall 's intentions, his voice, as one eyewitness recalled, was  \"rather jerky and uneven\"  as he began the speech, though  \"as he proceeded it became steadier and more impressive.\"  As for his style of presentation, even the Presbyterian weekly newspaper, the  Witness  , conceded that  \"it was everything that could be desired. . . . Clear as noonday, chaste, and rising at times to true eloquence, it reflected honour on the whole Association. . . . There was no flippancy, no sneering coarseness, but a calm recognition of the solemnity of the task in hand.\"  Yet for all that, Tyndall had profaned sacred principle and violated social propriety. To attack orthodox Christianity was one thing. To do so in Belfast of all places, where Calvinist professors had nurtured the scientific enterprise, was simply not  \"in good taste.\"   8  \n  CALVINISM \u00abS CHAMPIONS: WATTS AND HODGE  \n During the Belfast fracas, Robert Watts (1820-1895) emerged as the most doughty defender of orthodox Calvinism. He had studied in the early 1850s at Princeton Theological Seminary in New Jersey under the tutelage of Charles Hodge, J. Addison Alexander, and W. H. Green, all major figures in nineteenth-century American theology, before returning to his native Ireland to take up the position of professor of systematic theology at the Presbyterian College in Belfast. At Princeton he had found himself among a company of leading Calvinists who saw themselves as the scholarly guardians of conservative Presbyterian theology. So it is not surprising that it was Watts, more than anyone else, who gave the Irish Presbyterian 's College its  \"reputation for virile Calvinism\"  during the middle decades of the century. Under Watts 's regime the college became a  \"citadel of Calvinism,\"   \"worldwide in its reputation for scholarship and orthodoxy\" ; for this reason Scottish students crossed the Irish Sea to hear him discourse on reformed dogmatics. The connection between Belfast and Princeton that Watts cemented was to remain firm for generations, as numerous students for the ministry of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland opted to pursue their studies in New Jersey.  9  Indeed it was William Gibson 's visit to the Princeton Theological Seminary - where his son was a student - in the late 1850s that encouraged him to work for the establishment of the Assembly 's College in Belfast modeled on the Princeton prototype. As for Watts, determined to make Belfast another Princeton, he demonstrated his boundless enthusiasm for Hodge 's  Systematic Theology  by ensuring that it remained the standard textbook in Belfast until the end of the century. \n Watts remained a lifelong devotee of Princeton theology, and, like his mentor Hodge, he emerged as a staunch critic of Darwinian evolution. In the very year that Tyndall created such a sensation in Belfast, Hodge published his last book,  What Is Darwinism?  His diagnosis was as clear as it was simple: Darwinism was atheism. Hodge 's answer is certainly well known and, at least among some later commentators, earned him the reputation of being both reactionary and obscurantist. Frank Hugh Foster, for instance, condemned him as  \"not a man to entertain new ideas, and it may be doubted if he was capable of understanding them\"  ; Herbert Hovenkamp observed that  \"Hodge was paricularly paranoid about science\"  ; and Wilson R. Jackson asserted that his  \"career and world view were both rigid and confined\"  and that his \"ways of thinking were as severely constricted as the geography of his career.\"  10", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d9d57f0d-7217-4822-9831-511392da21e8", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.563241+00:00"}
{"text": "<Rhyming weavers>\n\n\n<$A>\n CHAPTER 5 \n  A Sense of Place: Landscape and Locality in the Work of the\nRhyming Weavers  \n by Ivan Herbison \n Throughout the period from 1750 to 1850, the century during which the weaver poets of Antrim and Down produced the greater part of their work, Ulster remained a predominantly rural society.  1  The population continued to increase until the Great Famine of 1846-48 reversed this trend, ushering in a period of rural depopulation. The Rhyming Weavers were born into this agricultural environment; many continued to maintain smallholdings to supplement their income from weaving. Given this context, one could be forgiven for assuming that traditional themes of life in the countryside, of landscape and locality, of nature and environment would feature prominently in the work of these poets. However, there is no coherent or well-defined tradition of landscape poetry to be found in the Rhyming Weavers. Few of them seem to have analysed their experience of rural life and landscape as comprehensively as one might have expected from poets who were acknowledged and proclaimed as bards of their native townlands. What one does find in the work of the most prominent, such as James Orr of Ballycarry and David Herbison of Dunclug, is a deep attachment to the notion of community and a sense of local identity. \n Yet this sense of place which is so evident in their work is merely one aspect of a much more complex and ambivalent relationship to the land. There is a danger of exaggerating the extent to which the Rhyming Weavers identified themselves with their localities, or of misrepresenting the concept of local identity as a wholly positive allegiance. In reality there was a constant tension in the lives and writings of the weaver poets between the sense of place and the experience of displacement. They were not immune to the forces of economic and social change which were transforming Ulster from an agrarian to an industrial society, nor could they avoid the effects of the political transformation which led to the decline and eventual collapse of the radical dissenting tradition. \n The experience of displacement manifested itself in several ways. The most obvious was the process of urbanisation, which had a profound impact on the lives of several rural bards. The case histories of two, Andrew McKenzie of Dunover and Thomas Beggs of Ballyclare, will serve to illustrate the fate of many of their contemporaries. \n Andrew McKenzie was born near the village of Dunover, County Down in 1780. He was the second son of a smallholder who worked hard to provide his family with a modest education. According to the poet John Fullarton,  'in his fourteenth year McKenzie was apprenticed to the trade of linen-weaving. . . . He followed this branch of occupation for many years, and his best and happiest days were passed on the loom'   2 . Like so any of his fellow-weavers, he developed a passionate interest in poetry, which offered an escape from the tedium of work. In the Preface to his first volume, he wrote:  'I found poetry a sweet walk for the imagination' . In the same Preface he also comments on the constraints of his economic situation, referring to himself as one  'whose feelings have been too frequently wrung by the hard hand of poverty'  (p.8). Despite many hardships he continued to write poetry and became a regular contributor to the  Belfast Newsletter  . Encouraged by the Ballymena printer and bookseller George Dugan, his first collection,  Poems and Songs on Different Subjects,  appeared in 1810. According to David Herbison, this publication earned him the not inconsiderable sum of 200 pounds, with which he built a cottage. 'Mount Gaelus', named after his pseudonym as a contributor to the  Belfast Newsletter,  and also acquired a fishing boat.  3  In the midst of this apparent security two disasters were to underline the precarious condition of human happiness. His fishing boat was wrecked and McKenzie barely escaped drowning. Then, as a consequence of a dispute over his lease, he was evicted from his cottage. He was forced to seek employment in Belfast and held a succession of poorly paid jobs. Despite these trying circumstances he continued to write poetry, but was unable to publish another collection,  The Masonic Chaplet and Other Poems,  until 1832, 22 years after his first volume. Unfortunately it failed to revive his fortunes. Fullarton paints a distressing picture of his final years: \n  His eyes were somewhat sunk, mild and tranquil; and possessed of little fire or determination. He bore all the appearance of a man of seventy, although then sixteen years under that age, his voice was slow, subdued, and broken.   4  \n McKenzie died a pauper in 1839, and was buried in Shankill graveyard. A fellow poet, William McComb, erected a headstone to his memory. \n Not surprisingly, McKenzie 's use of landscape reflects his experience. He has a nostalgic regard for his native countryside, made the more poignant by his sense of irrevocable loss. Nowhere are these feelings more eloquently expressed than in his poem 'Gannaway Burn': \n The spot whare the earliest May-flowers I gathered, On memory 's vista I mark wi'delight: The bank whare I watched till the nestlings were feathered An' wept when I found they had a' ta'en their flight: That pool where the quick fleeting minnows pursuing, I waded, nor wist how the time glided by; That nook where I lingered the green rushes pu'ing, Till gloaming' had spread her dark veil o'er the sky. . .. The dark grove o' pine which its margin o'erhaded, Fond memory will cherish while life warms by breast; There often ere sorrow my bosom invaded, I strayed wi' blithe comrades, in innocence blest. But that grove is laid low, an' my comrades so cheery, Are gane to that country whence nane can return: While some who survive wander heartless an' weary. Like me, far awa' frae the Gannaway Burn! \n The experience of Thomas Beggs in many respects parallels that of McKenzie, and confirms the pattern of misery which could so easily befall a rural poet driven to the city out of economic necessity. Beggs, born at Glenwherry, County Antrim, in 1789, was the son of a farm labourer. As a boy he went to sea for a brief period and was shipwrecked off Rathlin Island, an experience which diminished somewhat the attractions of the seafaring life. He then sought employment in the bleachworks of Richaf Bell at Ballyclare. During his time there he published his first volume,  Miscellaneous Pieces in Verse  (1819). He was promised a more rewarding position in Belfast but it failed to materialise. During an unsettled period Beggs undertook a walking tour of North Antrim and did not find regular employment again until 1825, when he obtained a position in a bleachworks in Belfast. Once again he lost his job and, unable to support his family, was forced to return to his mother 's home. He was constantly in and out of work during the 1840s. He died at the age of 58 in the typhus epidemic of 1847.  5  \n Another important cause of displacement was emigration. There were many poets amongst the great exodus of emigrants from Ireland during the nineteenth century. James McHenry of Larne (1785-1845, John Smyth of Ballymena (1783-1854), and Henry McD Flecher of Moneyrea (1827-c.1909) all left for America.  6  David Herbison of Dunclug emigrated to Quebec in 1827 but was shipwrecked and returned home to Ballymena. Yet his three brothers and all but one of his children joined the exodus.  7  \n It is evident from these brief biographical sketches that for most rural poets displacement and dispossession were the experiences which formed their attitudes to concepts of place, landscape and identity. John Hewitt 's assertion that  'a poet of the folk was emphatically a poet of a place'  8   needs careful qualification. That sense of place so conspicuously valued by Hewitt cannot be taken for granted. When it is successfully achieved, as in the case of Orr and Herbison, we must attempt an explanation and analysis. \n James Orr of Ballycarry achieves a distinctive sense of place in his poetry with a comparatively restrained use of description. There are, admittedly, several encomia of his native Ballycarry, where he lived throughout his life, apart from a brief sojourn in America, where he had fled after the failure of the 1798 Rebellion.  9  Yet Orr 's sense of place owes more to his use of language than to his use of landscape. His vigorous, unselfconscious use of the vernacular Ulster-Scots dialect in his work creates a vivid sense of locality. In his dialect poems style and subject-matter are perfectly matched. They speak of a whole community: the language, the landscape and the people are united in a single vision of their identity. \n Orr 's technique is well illustrated by a poem such as 'To the Potatoe'. \n Waeworth the proud prelatic pack, Wha Point an' Pratoes downa tak! Whit them galore, an' whyles a plack Ta mek' me frisky, I'll fen, an' barley freely lack - Except in whisky. What wad poor deels on bogs an' braes. Whase dear Cot-Tacks nae meal can raise; Wha ne'er tase butter, beef or cheese, Nor pit new clais on; While a' they mak' can har'ly please Some rack-rent messon. . . . The weel-pair't peasants, kempin', set ye; The weak wee boys, sho'el, weed, an' pat ye; The auld guid men thy apples get any Seedlin's to raise; An' on sow'n-seeves the lasses grate ye, To starch their claes. (Collected Poems, pp. 56-59) \n This poem characteristically condenses the whole life of his community into a series of vivid scenes. The potato becomes a focus for his real subject, an invocation of rural life: planting, harvesting, loading carts, starching clothes, eating  'creesht scons'  and champ. Orr 's appeal is to shared experience. 'The Irish Cottier's Death and Burial' similarly depends for its success on it qualities of homeliness, its intimate domestic references, its characteristic ambivalence towards the customs of the wake: \n Cou'd he whose limbs they decently hae stretch'd, The Followers o' freets awake an' mark, What wad he think o' them, he oft beseeched To be mair wise than mind sic notions dark? To bare the shelves o' plates they fa' to wark; Before the looking-glass a claith they cast; An' if a clock were here, nae ear might hark Her still'd han's tell how hours and moments pass'd; Ignorance bred sic pranks, an' custom gars them last. (Collected Poems, p. 263) \n Orr 's highly developed sense of place and sense of language may be seen as both his strength and his weakness. In addressing his own locality Orr cannot address a wider audience outside his own locality. There is a price to be paid for his faithfulness to the idea of community and shared experience. \n The work of Thomas Beggs provides an interesting contrast to that of James Orr. Though Beggs was capable of writing strong dialect verse, as in 'The Auld Wife 's Address to her Spinning Wheel', he is nevertheless defensive about his use of Ulster Scots, and evidently feels the need to justify himself against the accusation of literary imitation: \n Should the reader of the following effusions suppose, that in some parts the Author has imitated the Scottish Dialect, he would wish to correct the idea by alleging that he has written in his own style - in the language of his native glen - not constrained but spontaneous as the lispings of our first speech. \n Beggs ' removal to Belfast and the subsequent periods of unsettlement and unemployment meant that he lacked that strong sense of local identity which was the basis of Orr 's poetry. So Beggs looks for a substitute landscape to replace the locality which he conspicuously lacks. He finds one in the only landscape fully accessible to him, that of poetic convention. In his eyes Rathlin Island is transformed into a mysterious place of romantic wildness, where the lone bard meditates on the sea: \n The crimson flush of eve had shed. O'er heat-cowl'd Carey's wizard head. The grey goat bounded o'er the waste. To shun the traveller's path in haste; On pinions fleet of hoary blue, In ether far the heron flew - The wind was hushed - the clouds away, And nature looked as glad and gay As if an angel's smile had been With all its brightness o'er the scene; When from that desert, dark and wild, A lonely, musing, minstrel child Stood gazing on the Celtic sea. As if spell-bound so rapt was he; And dreaming in poetic vein. Saw paradise in bloom again. (The Poetical Works of Thomas Beggs, pp.99-100) \n Here Beggs is seeking a reversion to the landscape of Eden, and attempts to find security in some prelapsarian poetic paradise. His desire for escapism is understandable, given the circumstances of his own experience as a rural poet deprived of his native landscape by urbanisation and economic imperative. Beggs ' use of the pastoral can thus be seen as an expression of and a response to displacement. \n The experience of David Herbison, The Bard of Dunclug, complements that of Orr and Beggs. Like Orr, he spent nearly all his life in one place, and thus possesses a strong sense of local identity. Like Beggs, he found it more and more difficult to express that identity. The displacement experienced by Herbison was of cultural and linguistic nature. Questions of cultural identity are raised in his early works as the attempts to discover a distinctive voice. His first two volumes,  The Fate of M'Quillan and O'Neill's Daughter  (1841) and  Midnight Musings  (1848), are exploratory works in which he tries his hand at a number of poetic styles. Not surprisingly, these volumes reveal a sometimes confused eclecticism rather than a comfortable sense of belonging. Herbison 's poem 'The Rowantree' resembles Beggs ' 'Rathlin'. It is a naive attempt to transplant an English topographical poem to a local setting. The following extract demonstrates the unconvincing result: \n Now oh now old Killyfleugh! Breaks upon the enraptured view; Lying on the green hill side, Robbed of all its power and pride, See it sinking in decay, All its splendour is away. On its melancholy walls Every night the owlet calls.

{"text": "<Irish lace>\n\n\n<$A>\n Irish Lace \n Tradition or Commodity? \n by LINDA BALLARD \n Folk Life, vol 31 \n Among the many popular images associated with Ireland, that of a woman sitting outside a dwelling and engaged in needlework is very familiar, and the description 'traditional Irish lace' is glibly applied to many products available on the crafts market, but in what ways may Irish lace be considered traditional? What factors have governed its production, and how is it related to the lives of the people who made it? In addressing these questions, it is necessary to consider the contribution which Irish needlework has to make to an appreciation of the Irish visual tradition, a subject which has suffered some neglect. Lace was made in a great many places throughout Ireland, and a wide variety of types of work was produced. It is appropriate to begin by looking into the background to lace production, and to give an introduction to the different types of Irish lace. \n This Tradition of producing skilled needlework may be traced back beyond the existence of the medieval guilds at least to the era of the Brehon Laws. These stipulate that the fine for the theft of an embroidery needle was an ounce of silver. The subsequent vicissitudes of the industry, particularly in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, from the disastrous impact on Irish lacemaking on the ruin of the woollen trade to the protection of the producers of gold and silver laces in Dublin in the 1770s are traced by Elizabeth Boyle. Her book,  The Irish Flowers  is nowadays notoriously difficult to track down, but her two articles 'Embroidery and Lacemaking, 1600- 1800' and 'Embroidery and Lacemaking in Ulster' are more accessible.  1  In the period preceding the nineteenth century, bone (bobbin or pillow) lace, embroidery and drawnthread work were among the types of needlework produced in Ireland. There is evidence of domestically produced needlework, and of professional embroiderers producing impressive banners for ceremonial use, or furnishing for elegant interior decoration. Lacemaking was also taught to the poor as a means of earning a living. The records of the workhouse in Dublin show that in 1743 the children there earned for the institution <*> pound sign </*> 160. 14s. 0 1/2d. from the production of bone lace.  2  \n Much of the surviving lace was made during the nineteenth century, when various factors, including the popularity of the commodity itself, influenced its production. Throughout the century, energetic women of some social conscience realized that lacemaking held potential as a means of alleviating poverty, and various techniques were introduced or developed. Lacemaking provided an income for many during the Famine years of the 1840s, but more general levels of poverty were also addressed. Needlework was among the skills fostered by the Congested Districts Board, and c. 1920 the income of an average family in The Rosses, Co. Donegal, was estimated as <*> pound sign </*> 43. 0s. 0d. , of which <*> pound sign </*> 7. 10s. 0d. (approximately 18 <*> per cent sign </*>) was earned from 'knitting, sewing, etc.' This is second only to earnings for migratory labour in Scotland, and contributed more to the family than either the sale of cattle or the sale of eggs. (Incidentally, the accounts suggest that the average Rosses family could expect to be in the black to the tune of 4s. 9d. per annum.)  3  \n Several different types of handmade lace were produced in Ireland in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Many of these enterprises were 'school' based. Lace schools offered instruction and marketed products. Although pupils were expected to attend and to work at the school itself, once they were fully trained they might be permitted to work at home with occasional attendance at the school, behaving more like outworkers using the school as an agency. In Co. Londonderry, Mrs Ross and Mrs Ritter organized a school at which girls could learn bobbin lacemaking. They produced torchon-type lace, which was very popular as trimming and was very similar to work produced at many other centres. Other types of bobbin lace were made in Ireland during the nineteenth century. The collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum includes samples described as 'new Irish blonde', but nothing else about the lace is known. \n Pure needlepoint laces, both flat and raised, were produced in Ireland. Flat needlepoint, sometimes known as 'Irish rosepoint', was particularly associated with centres such as Kenmare, Youghal and New Ross. Some raised needlepoint was also produced at New Ross, and during the 1840s this type of lace began to be made at Tynan in Co. Armagh. It was later produced at other centres, the best known of which is Innismacsaint in Co. Fermanagh. The industry was inaugurated there by the Misses Macken, sisters-in-law of the rector, George Tottenham. It was later fostered by Ellen Hassard, a native of the area who possessed a talent for design. She was awarded a grant which enabled her to study art at the Metropolitan School of Art in Dublin. In addition to her artistic flair, Miss Hassard was an able business woman, and attended herself to the various administrative aspects of marketing and of supervising production, as well as to teaching lacemaking. Under her influence, Innismacsaint lacemaking flourished, and it seems that much of it was destined for the United States, and for San Francisco in particular. The decline in its production appears to have coincided with the San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906. \n Needlepoint lace is made by laying down a couched thread on a design drawn on calico. Buttonhole stitches are worked in different combinations from the couched thread, without piercing the calico, to form the design. The couching stitches are then carefully cut to free the lace from its backing. This type of lace was imitated by the makers of Irish crochet. \n Crochet was encouraged in many European convents, and it appears that this work came into Ireland under the auspices of the Ursuline Order, which was established in Cork by the late eighteenth century. Irish crochet lace was particularly prized by the French fashion industry of the early twentieth century, and was also very popular in America. Alan Cole conceded that Irish crochet at its best possessed  'a certain cachet' . It is distinguished by the decorative motifs, roses, trefoils and other shapes incorporated in the work. Crochet lace is worked with a hook in the same manner as wool crochet, the hook and yarn being much finer. It is sometimes said that the eye might be broken in a sewing needle to produce a hook sufficiently fine, the point being put into a cork. Irish crochet copied the sculpted effect of needlepoint lace and could be produced more quickly, but the designs were often poor quality. In 1897 Cole found it necessary to criticize design deficiencies and remarked of the crochet school in Ardara:\n The trade leaves the invention of ornamental forms for crochet work practically to the workers themselves, who have had no training in drawing and consequently cannot produce properly designed patterns.  4   \n Crochet was also worked in combination with braids or tapes, and work of this type was sold in Paris under the title 'Irish work'. Braid lace may also be produced by combining types and embroidery. Much work of this kind was made in Ireland, and early in the present century handmade lace curtains and other household items were being produced in Connemara. This lace is described as  'a strong linen mesh net on which various widths and patterns are sewn, so as to compose the design'.   5  Household textiles like these enjoyed considerable popularity in Edwardian homes.   Many of the laces so far referred to might be described as 'real' laces, as the entire fabric is produced by the lacemaker, but perhaps the best known Irish laces, Carrickmacross and Limerick, use machine-made net as a ground. Ada Longfield specifies that Nottingham machine net was generally used in the production of Limerick lace.  6  This work was started by an English business man, Charles Walker, who had married into a lacemaking family. In 1829, he brought a group of twenty-four women to Limerick to teach lacemaking. \n Three types of Limerick lace are made. Run lace is embroidery or darning on net, and is similar to laces made in English centres such as Nottingham and the Isle of Wight. Tambour lace, worked with a hook, is heavier in appearance than run work, and resembles work made at Goggeshall in Essex. The third type of Limerick lace, often considered the most successful, combines tambour and run work, the design being outlined with a hook and filled with embroidery stitches. Other techniques, such as net in decoration applied to net ground, were also known to Limerick lacemakers. Terms such as 'Limerick' and 'Carrickmacross', while they refer to important centres of lace production, may also be used to differentiate techniques of lacemaking, irrespective of the area of origin of the piece of lace itself. \n A similar type of lace to that usually associated with Limerick was produced in Kells, in Co. Meath. This industry also had strong links with Nottingham, and Dunlevy states that it  'was established in 1825 by Emma Hubbard. Her brother Henry, born about 1791, owned a lace-manufacturing business in Nottingham'.   7  Links between this city and the Irish lace industry remained strong during the early nineteenth century. \n Carrickmacross work resembles these laces as it makes use of a similar net ground and repertoire of stitches. The most popular form of Carrickmacross lace combines embroidery with fine appliqu&/e. The appliqu&/e is worked first, and nowadays is usually of organdie, although in the past fine cambric was used. A sheet of net covers the paper pattern, and this in turn is covered by a length of the fabric to be applied. The appliqu&/e design is couched unto the net and the surplus is cut away using special scissors and taking care not to cut the net. Additional decoration is worked by embroidering the net. This type of work was    introduced   early in the nineteenth century. Later, a type of guipure lacemaking was introduced, and was popular for a short time. Guipure work was very successfully combined with appliqu&/e and embroidered lace, to make mixed Carrickmacross. \n The introduction of Carrickmacross lace is usually credited to Mrs Grey Porter, wife of the local rector, and it is generally believed that she discovered the technique by unpicking a piece of Italian work. Mrs Grey Porter employed a sewing maid, Annie Steadman, who seems to have helped to develop the craft in the 1809s. It was later fostered by the Misses Reid as a means of relieving young female tenants on their estate of the need to perform heavy farm work, but as Elizabeth Boyle commented,  'the help was by its nature too personal and too limited in scope to be lasting and as teaching and in organisation declined, so did the industry'.   8  \n This was exactly the problem which Cole identified in 1887 as being a widespread handicap to the Irish lace industry. He remarked of the work of the Ladies ' Industrial Society for Ireland:  With a Programme so innocent of commercial conditions it is not surprising that the Ladies ' Society did not live many years. During its short term of existence it experimented with diffusion of instruction in lacemaking and the encouragement of ornamental design ... But the operations of the Society were not very far reaching and, as usual, were undertaken under the stimulus of benevolence.  9   \n A charitable concern to improve conditions for local people underlay several Irish lacemaking enterprises of the early- and mid-nineteenth century, whether convent-based or otherwise directed. Cole was worried at the lack of commercial acumen exhibited by many of these enterprises, and felt that the Irish lace industry could become much more successful with the benefit of a    definite   aim and knowledge of necessary conditions.  10  During the 1880s he was instrumental in founding a committee dedicated to the improvement of the Irish lace industry. This committee was particularly involved in helping to promote high standards of design. One of its most active members was Florence Vere O'Brien, wife of a solicitor who, during the 1880s, was based in Co. Limerick. \n Mrs Vere O'Brien 's personal motivation was philanthropic rather than commercial. She was a gifted designer and an energetic organizer who devoted herself to improving the by then declined lacemaking industry in Limerick. Work produced under her direction was awarded prizes at various late nineteenth-century international exhibitions. When, towards the end of the century, she moved to Co. Clare she established another operation, the Clare Embroidery Industry. This began production in 1892, and gave a marketable skill to local women. Clare lacked the lacemaking background upon which Mrs    O'Brien   had been able to build in Limerick, but women in the locality quickly learned to do the work devised for them, which generally    employed   basic embroidery stitches worked in simple designs. Clare Embroidery made use of a range of bright, clear colours and was very popular for such items as children 's dress and ladies ' gardening aprons. Among the patrons of the industry was Queen Victoria, who ordered dresses decorated with Clare Embroidery for her grandchildren. The English royal family have long been patrons of the Irish needlework industry. A few Christmases ago, one Co. Down embroiderer was commissioned to embellish a number of pairs of boxer shorts with the Prince of Wales ' feathers. These were to be given as a gift by Diana to Charles. \n During the 1880s, Cole defined eight classes of Irish lace: needlepoint; pillow lace; drawn linen embroidery; cut linen work; crochet; braid and cord lace; embroidery on net and cambric embroidery.  11  We have already seen the close relationship between embroidery and many types of Irish lace, and Levey commented of early laces that  'Their technical origins lay ... in the different embroidery and other techniques used to decorate linen items of costume and furnishing'  .  12  Linen production and its decoration have been of great economic importance, especially in the north of Ireland, and Elizabeth Boyle discovered that the earliest detailed extant account of an embroidery and lace enterprise in Ulster relates to the Moravian community in Gracehill. In 1794, Thomas Russell found the women there employed  'in spinning, knitting, all sort of needlework embroidery'   13  by means of which they supported themselves.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "bd39b871-8b65-48c6-9377-3dda34014eeb", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.565559+00:00"}
{"text": "<Irish in education>\n\n\n<$A>\n  A LANGUAGE POLICY FOR IRISH SCHOOLS  \n Helen &/O Murch&/u \n <&Irish> Comhar na M&/uinteoiri Gaeilge </&Irish> \n This paper looks, in a general way, at the State 's overall language policy in education (including some aspects of the current debate) and makes some proposals. \n The reasons why people learn languages or - more significantly - are offered languages for learning are many and varied. They range from the exigencies of purely utilitarian short term needs to richly cultural long term aspirations. All - in their different ways - may be a source of individual and societal enrichment. Many, unfortunately, are often presented as being mutually exclusive, although this is not necessarily the case. Some aims, particularly when followed by successful outcomes, may generate others. No argument, however, is generally as clearcut as a purely superficial examination may convey. Most explanations on language learning seem too often embedded in a complex cluster of often almost contradictory factors, usually emanating from several sources, and rarely clearly grounded in some basic easily comprehended principles. Too often, they serve only to illuminate the particular personal/societal biases of the moment. This is especially, but not uniquely, the case in Ireland. \n The individual 's access to languages is constrained by three possibilities: self-instruction, what the market and commercial language schools decide as most lucrative, and what the state system offers. The state 's language policy is then of crucial importance, needing  clarity  and  coherence.  Unfortunately, this is not yet the case in Ireland. \n  Languages and Educational Policy in Ireland  \n Policy is generally taken to mean  'any broad statement of aims'  (Johnson, p.2) or  'general principles and courses of action designed to achieve some educational purpose'  (Kellaghan in Mulcahy, p.193). However, the mere existence of the policy or idea is not sufficient, as Johnson shows.  'It must then be operationally defined. Any necessary resources must be prepared.'  On this basis, it would appear that we have no lack of policy  statements  on the languages currently offered,  or not offered,  in our educational system; that some courses of action have not been defined; but that we still do not have a coherent language policy, encompassing all the linguistic possibilities of our actual and potential situation. I leave aside the vexed question of resources! Language policy, such as it is, is generally taken to refer to the Irish language only, which does little service to either Irish or the other languages in the school system. There are also  parallel  policies on the different languages taught at present. What is lacking is a coherent planning framework with some attempt at least at mutually complementary decision-making processes. This is not due to lack of advice. The Report of the Board of Studies on Languages (August 1987) to the (then) Curriculum and Examinations Board, for example, was a preliminary move in this direction. \n A recent publication on Irish educational policy (Mulcahy and O'Sullivan, eds.) offers several reasons for this lack of coherence: piecemeal change, lack of longterm planning, the influence exerted by individuals and pressure groups on government planning. In other words, neither the existence nor the needs of  systems  are admitted by adhocery. \n To this must be added the problems of the politician as policy-maker,  'the primary consideration of most governments being to maintain, and if possible, extend their power, influence and  acceptability'   - italics mine - (Johnson, p.3) and what O'Sullivan calls  'the atheoretical character of educational thinking in Ireland'  (in Mulcahy and O'Sullivan, p.265) with subsequent over-emphasis on 'issues', often unrelated, and the need for Ministers to find  'a new issue which can be identified with them and provide a direction for their term of office'.  No wonder 'slogans', as short and pithy as possible, high-sounding, capable of many satisfying interpretations but deriving from no internally consistent set of principles, are popular as explanations of 'policy'. Our chief policy-makers wish to be unambiguously ambiguous, all things to all men, the stuff of survival. This is not, however, to preclude the use of some snappy formulations of coherent policy principles, a national language policy, - reflecting our vision of ourselves as Irish national and European citizens - designed to grab public attention and stimulate public imagination, not to mention placating our hard-pressed politicians. \n The language policy of a country is, of course, most clearly seen in the total linguistic education it offers its populace. This should not, however, occlude the fact that this is not the only way the policy is either manifested or developed.  '...language policy is formulated and implemented and accomplishes its results within a complex interrelated set of economic, social and political processes which include, inter alia, the operation of other nonlanguage state policies'  (&/O Riag&/ain, International Journal of the Sociology of Language, No 70).  'National language policies are determined by socio-political pressures which vary from one culture and socio-political system to another'  (Johnson, p.3). If 'coherence' is taken to mean the realisation by planners of the  interdependence  of  all  the factors involved in the decision-making process, two facts follow. First, there must be a clearly visible relationship between school language policy and general education policy in combination with state language policy - and overall state policy for the country and its people. A framework of the 'policy planning/determination' advocated by Rodgers (in Johnson) might be a useful place to begin such a consideration particularly by adapting it to local circumstances. Beginning with the syllabus and hoping that overall changes in state policy can thus be developed or inferred is not a course favoured by Rodgers.  'When new educational goals are sought or old goals are felt to have been inadequately realised, specification of a new syllabus has been the typically favoured solution'  (p.25). This  'linear model'  he rejects for  'more multi-dimensional qualitative, interactive participant extended'  approaches. Secondly, since education is but a part of the larger state and social systems, Swales (in Johnson) argues for an  'ecological opportunity-cost based'  approach, which would take into account the fairly precarious balance in which the various subsets of the system co-exist. He asks very valid questions about what one can (or cannot) 'afford' to do (or not to do). Are we only planning changes or genuinely attempting radical new policies? Or merely trying to be in pace with the fashion? We must attempt to find out what we don't know, determine whether we are asking the right questions  before  we provide any solutions. There is a world of difference between:\n  <&Irish> 'An t&/e nach bhfuil a fhios aige agus go bhfuil a fhios aige nach bhfuil a fhios aige' </&Irish>  and\n  <&Irish> 'An t&/e nach bhfuil a fhios aige agus nach bhfuil a fhios aige nach bhfuil a fhios aige!' </&Irish> \n  ('He who does not know and knows he does not know' and 'he who does not know and does not know he does not know!)  \n  In summary, what is needed then is a much clearer indication from our policy-makers (with perhaps much clearer guidance from those who counsel them) as to what constitutes the current national language policy of our state; how that is to be manifested across the state apparatus; how it is particularly expressed in and across the education system; how the aims of the policy are variously met by the specific objectives of the different language syllabi it encompasses.  Coherent curricula are those  'in which decision outcomes from the various stages of development are mutually consistent and complementary and learning outcomes reflect curricular aims'  (Johnson, xiii). Much has been accomplished, particularly in education and particularly in recent years. But the degree of  parallelism  that exists is still excessive, to the detriment of individual and organisational effort. It is not a case of attempting to reconcile the irreconcilable, but of ensuring complementarity instead of competition within our language syllabi. Fire-brigade action should ideally have no place in language policy. The fact that it is necessary is a clear admission of something rather less than perfection in this most important of state enterprises. \n Two statements will serve to indicate what are considered to be the general aims of our educational system. \n In his introduction to the White Paper on Educational Development of 1980, John Wilson, then Minister for Education, wrote in his Foreward that:\n   An educational system serves a dual purpose - to conserve traditional values and to prepare for the future. It provides for the task of interpreting the essential features of a social and cultural heritage and, at the same time, that of preparing the young for life in a society characterised by ever-accelerating change. \n To contribute towards the development of all aspects of the individual, including aesthetic, creative, critical, cultural, emotional, intellectual, moral physical, political, social and spiritual development, for personal and family life, for working life, for living in the community and for leisure.   (In our schools, March 1986) \n Both appear to derive largely from the Socratic view of education, enlarging the range and repertoire of each person, in the root sense of 'educare'. Both are in some difficulty with other views current that, as Peter Abbs puts it, are concerned not  'about the interior meanings of education, but  the external uses to which education can be put'   - italics mine - (Sunday Times, November 1987). Languages, and their 'usefulness', relative to one another, are a major part of this argument. The aims of our various language syllabi attempt some accommodation with these differing viewpoints, but not within a clear overall policy statement relating simultaneously to all the languages on the curriculum. Little, if any,    attempt   is made at elaborating general transferable principles that could benefit both teacher and taught. No attempt is made at situating the languages and their stated aims within the general educational aim. There may well be good reasons for this but difficulty is not one of them. \n It has been stated publicly by some closest to the evolution of our current syllabi that 'dirty words' such as 'profit' and 'cost-effectiveness' must be introduced into our educational vocabulary. This is perfectly legitimate - once the parameters for cost-effective analysis have been clearly and unequivocally marked out. Otherwise, it is education itself that will become the 'dirty word'. Criteria for the 'usefulness' of different languages, and the life-enhancing possibilities inherent in all of them need rigorous categorisation in relation to the state 's language policy, the general aims of education and the objectives of the various syllabi. Such an extension of the concept of 'usefulness' would of itself be a most useful contribution to the 'rational consideration of the language policy in our educational system' which Dr. Edward Walsh called for in 'Comhairle', January 1988. \n  Irish and English  \n Looked at objectively, it is clear that our two indigenous languages, Irish and English (in historical order) serve the general educational aims cited rather well, each in their different way, and would have to be considered an indispensable component of state language policy. Questions have been raised, however, about the relative 'value' of the intensity and duration of school exposure to Irish as L2. But when seen against what should be their proper educational context, the argument which some people have made must be regarded as personalised and fragmented. A dispassionate discussion of the question of universal Irish at Senior Level, for example, requires that more fundamental questions first be answered. For example, is a specialist or broadly based Senior Cycle envisaged? Our present Senior Cycle is broadly based. It is a widely held view that such a broadly based system is not only a creditable one, but better than a specialised approach. Obviously, the opposite view is also held. But we are not alone in preferring our kind of system. Scotland, too, has rejected over-specialisation and England - and Wales - are considering certain changes in the same direction. \n Anyway, if serious consideration is being given to the educational experience offered by our Senior Cycle, one must begin with the question of whether we continue with our broadly based approach, revised if necessary, or whether we opt for specialisation. In the absence of such a consideration of the first fundamental question, it seems perverse and tendentious to single out one subject without defining what the debate is really about. The position of individual subjects must surely depend on whether one is talking about a specialist system or a broadly based system. \n In this line of argument, assuming that one is going to continue with a broadly based system, it is not unreasonable to review from time to time what the core subjects in that broadly based system ought to be.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "1b476da7-6c99-41df-a4ac-dc81ebc1fa22", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.566650+00:00"}
{"text": "<Sylvia Plath>\n\n\n<$A>\n SYLVIA PLATH: THE DOUBLE IN THE WOMAN AND THE USE OF IT IN HER WORK \n Bernadette Fallon\nUniversity College Galway \n Abstract \n My contribution to this publication first challenges the widely held opinion that Sylvia Plath was concerned only with self destruction in her work. It proposes the notion that the driving force in her poetry and prose is an affirmative, recreative one which overcomes male dominance in life and literature. Since Plath 's work is based almost exclusively on autobiography, it is vital to take a look at the circumstances of the life which shaped the work. Therefore an outline of her life is presented, with an emphasis on my main theme in the chapter,  i.e. the doubles and masks in Plath 's life. This use of doubles in the life is next extended to her novel  The Bell Jar  and her last collection of poetry  Ariel,  where the doubles are overcome and ultimately the positive voice emerges supreme over the negative. \n Sylvia Plath is known to many only as a cult figure who achieved her status with her suicide in February 1963. Looked at in this light it is inevitable that her poems are seen as self destructive death wishes and suicidal ravings of a woman determined to die. This is how  Ariel,  her last volume of poems written in the months before she died, is usually seen. Critics have observed that the circumstances of her death have been the main contributing factor in seeing her life and work as being morbidly attracted to her death. \n It is true to say that some of the poems in this collection are quite depressing and death-related in themselves. Obviously poems written in the weeks immediately preceding her death reflect her suicidal tendencies at that time. But the strength of the book, and its main driving force comes from the \"October\" poems. Written in October 1963, they are the product of early morning writing sessions after her separation from husband, poet Ted Hughes. \n These poems are positive affirmations of her new found independence. She had overcome her depression at the initial break up and had found a positive voice. They are poems of strength and rebirth. She was elated by them herself and although people do interpret them as destructive because of the references to death, it is not death as destruction that she is concerned with. Instead it is the death of the self which is necessary to preceded resurrection in a new recreated form. As she comments in one such poem, \"Lady Lazarus,\" the dying and destruction are easy, it is the come-back and resurrection which are hard. But ultimately it is that resurrection which  Ariel  concerns itself with and this is the driving force of the collection. \n Although Plath had been writing, both poetry and prose, since she was very young, her earlier style is very artificial and shallow. She aimed towards a commercial market, publishing pieces in magazines for payment - therefore her style varied to suit each particular magazine. Only in later years did she find an authentic voice (acknowledged also by Ted Hughes in his introduction to her  Journals.  Hence her appreciated work is not very extensive. Besides her collections of poetry she published a novel,  The Bell Jar,  in 1963, just before her death. This novel is famous for its detached, ironic account of her first breakdown and suicide attempt when she was twenty. Although written in a fictionalized form, almost all of the characters and incidents in it are real. \n Her work is based almost exclusively on autobiography and familiarising ourselves with the facts of her life gives us a huge insight into her work. Aspects of her personality crop up constantly in her work - the most notable has to be the use of doubles. \n In reading her journals, her poetry, her prose and reading various accounts of her life, it is easy to become bewildered by the array of personalities and conflicting doubles that one has to sift through to find the real Plath. There are so many different faces presented - the calm confident high achiever versus the scared berating voice of the journals; the Sylvia who loved life to the full versus the destructive suicidal case; the longing to be an ordinary housewife and mother versus longing to be committed only to her art. \n So we can see that the doubles and conflicting selves are the real issue of Plath. This is the theme I wish to discuss, the double in the woman and the use of it in her work. In doing so I will take examples from her life, her novel  The Bell Jar  and her final poetry collection  Ariel.  \n Sylvia Plath was born October 27, 1932. As the oldest child she was the centre of attention, particularly as her only brother Warren was a sickly boy. Her father Otto Plath insisted that his daughter be treated as a unique personality and she was encouraged to achieve perfection in everything she did. This is reflected later on in her life when she experienced severe mental distress if she could not live up to the high standards she set for herself. \n In 1940 Otto Plath died after a long illness, leaving behind an eight year old daughter who had such h a strong emotional reaction to his death that it haunted her throughout the rest of her life. It gave her both material for her poems and at least one reason for her first suicide attempt. Although she was later to remark to friends in college that her father died while she still thought he was God, her attitude to him is not always this positive. At times she hates him for the all-encompassing hold he has on her that she cannot shake off - the Electra complex. Her attitudes to her father are traced and overcome in \"Daddy.\" \n The strange conflicting doubles that are so much a part of Sylvia become easier to detect once she leaves home for college in September 1950. In her letters home we see a cheerful optimistic Sylvia, displaying almost childlike excitement and loving everything. But this does not match with the tortured alienated voice of the journals as she constantly worried that her achievements were not good enough. Her desire to succeed meant that she studied constantly and kept to a rigid schedule. This rigid stance that she maintained in everything was necessary for her to contain the doubt ridden alienated Sylvia behind the calm smiling mask of the all round American girl. The evidence from her years at Smith College show these constant fluctuations of mood from ecstatic highs to depressing lows. \n At the end of her third year in Smith she spent the month of July guest-editing an important American magazine along with 19 other students. Her experiences there are documented almost exactly as they happened in the first part of the  The Bell Jar.  She often received criticism from her managing editor and this shook her confidence immensely. It was the beginning of a downward spiral to her attempted suicide later in the summer. \n The reasons for this attempt are apparently rather diverse. The atmosphere at home, and particularly her relationship with her mother during that summer of '53, is presented as somewhat stifling. This relationship appears very much the same love/hate one that she had with her father. Sylvia resented all the sacrifices her mother had made for her and felt that the burden of debt and gratitude it placed on her was overpowering. \n Along with this resentment was her own sense of failure, loss of belief in her own self worth and her conviction that she was going mad. The account of the actual attempt in  The Bell Jar  is very poetic and is a further extension of the calm, often humorous way that she presents her whole breakdown experience. Again it is evidence of the double in Plath. \n She returned to Smith College after Christmas, having spent the first part of the academic year recovering. She completed the second half of that year and returned in September for her final one. Her final year thesis is interesting in the light of Sylvia 's own personality - it was a study of the literary doubles in Dostoyevsky. \n After graduation she received a Fulbright scholarship to study in Cambridge, England. It was here that she met Ted Hughes and married him after an acquaintance of only five months. During this time she is happy in her letters home - they are filled with optimism and plans for the future. It can be seen however that Plath 's feelings of strength are only evident in times of happiness when things were going well. She could not carry her growth into the low points - always floundering when a bad patch hit. \n After her graduation from Cambridge the couple moved to America where Sylvia took up a teaching post in Smith. She quickly became frustrated with the job, however, as it left no time for the writing which was her main interest. So it was no surprise that she left Smith at the end of a year. She and Ted then devoted themselves to writing full time. \n They moved back to England a year later where their first daughter Frieda was born in April 1960. Both this and the demands of their writing posed too many problems in a small London flat so in 1961 they moved to Devon. Although life here is painted in idyllic scenes at first by Sylvia, the marriage was in trouble by the following year and Ted Hughes finally moved away from his wife and (by now) two children in October 1962. Sylvia now rejects the country life she has previously adored and wishes to find sanity in London, away from this  \"cow life\"  that she says is slowly suffocating her. Her letters at the time are quite wild with plans, as if she was desperately trying to grasp something she could live for. \n Because she could not sleep, a friend suggested that the write poems early in the morning. She followed this advice and out of it came the \"October\" poems. In these she rises above all the dependencies. These are interesting to look at especially for their feminist assertiveness but also for the part they play in her own personal struggle. \n Feminists point out that self sacrifice on the part of the female is expected by society. It is taken for granted that it is right that women should sacrifice themselves to allow men to pursue their goals in life. Therefore the destruction of the stereotypical woman is necessary for the rebirth of the self in a new recreated form. This destruction and rebirth is away of overcoming patriarchy for the female. This is a central concern of the feminist movement. A destruction of the conventional social order, the male centred view of the world is necessary. \n Sylvia Plath achieves this freedom from male domination, first in  The Bell Jar  by overcoming female stereotypical roles offered to her in the guise of various \"doubles\" for own personality and by doing so rejecting the niche that society has carved for her. This theme is developed further in  Ariel  where recreation is achieved in powerful new female forms. \n In  The Bell Jar  we find interesting constructions of Plath 's personality. Esther Greenwood, the heroine, is Sylvia. The other females in the book are all doubles for herself. There is Doreen, the bad side of Esther, who is quite lose with men, drinks a lot and is not worried about hard work. There is Betsy, the good girl representation, the homemaker personality of Esther. She is sweet and innocent, only wanting a nice husband and adorable children from life. The career choices are presented by Jay Cee, Esther 's managing editor on the magazine, and the Russian interpreter. These doubles are not very attractive as women however, suggesting the disapproving eye society casts on women who choose traditionally male paths in life. The voice of society comes through in Mrs Willard and Mrs Greenwood, both warning Esther of the importance of a girl remaining a virgin for her husband. \n This opposition of virginal purity versus sexual permissiveness is a main preoccupation in the novel. Esther wonders if she should remain pure for her husband or rush out to sleep with people just for the experience. She is dismayed at a society which accepts double standards as norm - expecting female purity while turning a blind eye to male sexual activities outside of marriage. It is represented in the way she builds up resentment towards her boyfriend Buddy after he had an affair with a waitress. She is not annoyed so much by his unfaithfulness to her but by his double standards - constantly pretending to be a virgin and expecting her to remain one also. \n Here her mother is the voice of society or Esther 's own common sense, pointing out the dangers of pregnancy. She gives Esther an article entitled \"In Defence of Chastity,\", basically saying that even if a man is not a virgin at marriage he will expect his wife to be one. Double standards have in this way been legitimised by society. \n Esthers ' doubles represent different sides of the purity/impurity debate - the choices are Betsy/Doreen polarities. Or should she turn pseudo-male like Jay Cee and the Russian interpreter? In fact she rejects all of the alternatives presented in the guise of doubles and instead undergoes a sexual liberation. Now she becomes the strong one in male/female relationships - previously deciding that she would \"let\" Constantin seduce her, she now meets Irwin and  \"decides to seduce him.\"  Similarly when Buddy Willard visits her at the hospital it is she who digs his car out of the snowdrift. \n As the doubles are created at the beginning of  The Bell Jar,  they are transcended by the end.  Ariel  goes on to achieve final and complete liberation from Plath 's conflicting doubles. In her best poems she achieves this by freeing herself from male dependence. They are written during her most difficult period but she exteriorises inner feelings to achieve a universalised expression of freedom and finds her true poetic voice, free at last of the masks. \n The  Ariel  poems contain many that are depressing in themselves. As it is published it ends on notes of despair and tragic finality - but this was not Plath 's wish. Her intended arrangement began with the word \"love\" and ended with the word \"Spring\" - a movement through affirmation to destruction, then resurrection. It is the resurrection which I am concerned with. This should be, as Plath intended, the overall tone of the book. The memorable poems are those in which the self emerges triumphant and victorious, particularly in \"Ariel\" itself, \"Lady Lazarus,\" \"Daddy\" and the \"Bee\" poems. \n The best example we can take here is \"Lady Lazarus.\" The very name Lazarus conjures up images of rebirth. The female here is destroyed, to achieve rebirth in a powerfully independent form -  \"eating man like air.\"  Her death takes place in the poem but it is the death necessary to precede resurrection. Therefore it is not a suicidal death wish but a creative act of liberation. \n The old self also dissolves in \"Ariel\" and \"Fever 103.\" Strains of the previous impurity question arise in \"Fever 103\" where the woman here is purged and purified. Her old selves dissolve and she is pure and virginal at the end of the poem. In \"Ariel\" the woman and the stallion fuse for form one and the old self is destroyed. She is now the powerful one, she is the arrow, the shaping force of her own life. \n \"Daddy\" is certainly an optimistic note in finally ridding herself of male domination. She shakes free of her father's shadow, that Godlike presence in her life, which took its form first in her father 's expectations for her, then in his memory and finally materialised again in a human shape - that of Ted Hughes (she confided to her mother that Ted filled the huge hole that she felt in not having a father). In the poem the husband and father are merged and overcome. The fact that she seems to have shaken off her father mentally by cutting his memory off at the root, and physically in her separation from Hughes, is certainly an experience of rebirth for her. \n One of her great achievements is that she does not deny her femininity, as some of her doubles have done, to achieve her liberation. In overcoming male domination she creates new female forms through which to achieve expression, e.g. lioness, queen bee, Lady Lazarus. \n Sylvia Plath died by her own hand in February 1963. Finally the conflicts became too much for her, the masks she had employed as supports had failed her. But, as I have pointed out, she achieved freedom and rebirth in life while she lived. This is what we should remember her for, this is her legacy.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "53d1733c-4321-493e-ae39-4c9261ee7a0e", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.567691+00:00"}
{"text": "<Fairy lore>\n\n\n<$A>\n MUSIC LEARNED FROM THE FAIRIES \n R&/IONACH U&/I &/Og&/AIN \n Legends of music learned from the fairies are well-documented in oral tradition in Ireland and serve to illustrate many aspects of our folklore, in particular the prominence of the belief in the otherworld and the direct involvement of that otherworld with music and musicians of exceptional quality. In addition, as the legends are part of the living tradition, they illustrate in a striking way, some features of Irish traditional music today. A number of tunes played by musicians are said to have originated from the fairies. \n Before turning to the legends themselves, it is important to consider briefly the role of music within the general context of fairy lore and supernatural lore. The fairies are said to dance, to play music and to sing. Singing, however, is not mentioned very often. In music then, they seem to amuse themselves in the manner of humans. The fairies ' musical pastimes occur in places closely associated with other fairy activities such as games or races. Generally these places are forts, raths, old moats, crossroads, ruined castles or caves. Accounts of fairy music indicate, therefore, that those who are familiar with a locality will know the time and the place chosen by the fairies for their music and they may go and listen to the music or join in the dancing. \n Usually fairy music is heard and fairy dancing is seen by human beings late at night. Such words as 'midnight' and 'moonlight' are used constantly in the accounts and increase the mysterious, unearthly aspect of the music. The instruments played by the fairies are usually the pipes or the fiddle and, with far less frequency, a harp or a fife and drum, or in one or two cases, a flute. The pipes preceded the fiddle in Ireland as the instrument most commonly used for providing dance music. The fiddle seems to have been played in Ireland by traditional musicians from the middle of the sixteenth century and its use had become widespread by the eighteenth century. The prominence of the pipes and of the fiddle in fairy lore is of interest, in that these are instruments closely identified with Irish traditional music; they can produce an unearthly sound, evocative of the otherworld and they are also instruments very well suited to dancing and to dance music. \n As with so many other aspects of fairy lore, the music of the fairies is in the paradoxical position of working for good and evil in the human world. For a human merely to hear fairy music may be an omen of great good fortune, or it may, on the other hand, be a portent of great evil or sorrow or even death. Whatever the result of hearing fairy music, an aspect central to it, and to the legends associated with it, is the compelling nature of the music of the fairies. We are told on several occasions of people hearing fairy music and being drawn towards it by its very nature. The music is so powerful that mortals find themselves compelled to dance to it and when they do, they dance without rest, for an hour or perhaps even for a whole week, night and day. There is a combination of motifs here in relation to fairy music and its essence; the supernatural lapse of time is an integral part of fairyland and music has the power to create this lapse.  1  When the fairy music stops, the mortal dancer is exhausted and very often becomes ill and dies a short time following his return to the ordinary world. So powerful is the music of the fairies that frequently it sends people to sleep. But the fairies obviously enjoy music a great deal and can themselves dance for a night and a day or longer. \n The identification of a changeling by mortals is often achieved by fairy music. If the person suspected of being a changeling plays unusually fine music, this is taken as proof that he or she is, in fact, a changeling. To this end, pipes or another instrument, were left beside the changeling and when the sweetest and most wonderful music imaginable was heard coming from the room, the mortals realised that the changeling was playing. There is a story told of Garrett Barry, a famous piper, that he was left to mind a one-year-old child while the child 's parents were away. Garrett thought that the child was asleep and started to play his pipes. The child spoke from the cradle to Garrett, saying:  'You 're good, but I 've heard better.'  When the child 's parents came home they couldn't believe what had happened, but the child is supposed to have died a short time later.  2  Fairy music is so beautiful that it defies description. It is called  'the finest music anyone ever heard on this earth',   3   'the grandest music in the world',   4  or  'the nicest music that he ever heard'.   5  \n The nature of the fairies and the quality and power of their music must be borne in mind in examining the legends telling or music learned from the fairies. This paper is merely a preliminary investigation of such legends. The investigation will centre on legends in which the point of the narration is that music is given by the fairies to a mortal. There are tales in which this motif is peripheral or semi-peripheral. These will not be dealt with in the present study of the legend. In this study, twenty-nine narratives have been examined although many other accounts, statements and tales have been consulted as background material and it may be said with certainty that further versions of these legends will come to light. The sources for this material are the manuscript and sound archives of the Department of Irish Folklore, University College Dublin, field recordings by Harry Bradshaw of Radio Telef&/is &/Eireann and some published material, including commercially recorded audio material. \n II \n The legends I deal with are for the most part quite short and    straightforward   in style of narration. There are certain elements which may be identified as fundamental to them. The first of these is the  context  in which the contact is made between the natural and supernatural. In the example studies, with one exception, the principal role is played by a mortal man; in the one instance, where a woman is concerned, there is no reference to a musical instrument but rather to lilting or puss music.  6  In most instances, the person who receives the music is a musician of some kind though it is often specified that he is not a very good musician. In more than half the material it is stated that the encounter occurs late at night or in the early hours of the morning; otherwise no time is specified with a single exception where it is said to have happened during the day. The mortal musician is on his way home, usually from a wedding or from visiting, or 'rambling' as it is called. The encounter takes place at a locality associated with the other world, at a  lios  or fort, a meadow, a bush, a bridge, on the beach, near the hills or near the woods. The musician is inevitably tired and may have been drinking so that he sits down to rest or falls asleep. It is interesting that in two instances we are told that the adventure occurred on 'Hallowe'en Night'  7  or on 'Bonfire Night'  8  or 'Midsummer 's Night', times at which human contact with the otherworld is to be expected. In one instance the encounter occurs at milking time in the evening, a time when the fairies would be going about their business.  9  The musicians are either pipers or fiddlers and there would appear to be an equal distribution of each. In one case we are told that the person owned a flute but was unable to play it although he wanted to do so. In two other instances we are told that the person had never played music before. And so the scene is set for the encounter between mortal and otherworld and the transmission of music. \n III \n Central to the encounter and the learning of music is the  purpose  in the transmission of the music. It is not always said that the human wants to learn music, or if he does, why he so wishes or if he wants to learn a particular tune, but this information, where it is given, serves as an important introduction to the actual encounter and in many instances is the reason specified for the encounter. Sometimes the fairies bestow the gift of music on the human in order to have him serve as musician to them. In most instances, however, there is no particular reason given for fairy music being learned by humans except that the quality of the music is so unusually beautiful and sweet that the mortal musician is drawn to it and learns it. In a few cases, the human being gets the gift so that he can make money by playing music,  10  and in other cases it is said that the musician was never poor afterwards, as he was in constant demand because of the quality of his playing after the encounter with the fairies. In still other instances the musician may have only one or two tunes before the encounter and where this occurs, he is on his way to a wedding or a dance and is afraid he will be mocked because he will have to play the same tune or tunes throughout the evening. Sometimes the name of the only tune known by the musician is specified as 'An R&/ogaire Dubh', [The Black Scoundrel], a well-known and often played jig.  11  \n There are a few narratives where the musician is about to enter a competition, the standard of fairy music of course being far higher than that of the human competitors. Occasionally, the mortal musician is borrowed by the fairies for a specific purpose, and is brought to a fairy feast because they lack a musician of their own.  12  An interesting point here is the dichotomy apparent in the situation where the fairies are renowned for their wonderful music and musicians, but have to send for a mortal musician to provide the music for them. There is a strong sense of compulsion in many of the narratives where the mortal musician is not given any choice as to his involvement in the fairy world, and this lack of choice is particularly strong in those stories in which the musician is brought into the fairy world to assist the fairies. \n IV \n The supernatural beings in these legends are generally described as fairies or fairy men who seem to have the same appearance as humans, as nothing to the contrary is specified. Sometimes a fairy horseman is mentioned and this occurs, logically, in those narratives where the human musician has to be carried off to the fairy feast to play music for them. In some instances the fairy is called the  p&/uca  and may have horns.  13  Infrequently, the supernatural creature is described as a small man or small red-haired man,  14  or the supernatural being may be the  lutharach&/an,  a dialect term for the  leipreach&/an.  \n Another feature which is central to these legends is the  method  in which the music is transferred. In most cases the human musician hears fairy music and memorises it so that he can play it again. The music is coming from a fairy haunt or travels through the air, perhaps over water. One account tells how a man when he heard the fairy music, put his thumb in his mouth and as a result, remembered the music.  15  This motif of the thumb of knowledge calls to mind Fionn mac Cumhaill and the way he received his gift of knowledge by sucking the thumb he had burned on the magical salmon of knowledge. It happens in certain cases that a magical instrument is given to the mortal to play and that it is the particular instrument rather than the musician 's talent which enables the musician to play wonderful music. A fairy appears and gives a man a new set of pipes with which he wins a music competition  16  or a fiddler takes his fiddle and gives it to a man who strokes the fiddle a few times, or runs his fingers across the strings and hands it back to him so that the fiddle is afterwards able to play any tune in the world.  17  In about half of my material, the gift of music is a magical gift of playing music which is of far superior quality to the music of human beings. The gift is given to musicians and non-musicians alike, although in most cases the person has some musical skill.

With this aim in mind, he sent 72 disciples to various countries on the three continents then known to be inhabited. The disciples were to spend 7 years in their respective country during which time they would acquire a thorough knowledge of that country 's language, (thus incidentally, anticipating by millenia the concept of the 'year abroad' in language training and acquisition). \n At the end of the seven years, F&/einius went with his disciples to the Plain of Seanair to learn the lingua humana, Hebrew, and set up schools for the teaching of different languages, in the city of Eath&/ena. The principal school was presided over by three sages, F&/einius himself, Gaedheal, son of Eathor of the race of Gomer from Greece and Caoi Caoinbhreathach from Judea. F&/einius remained in charge of the school for twenty years, long enough to allow Ni&/ul his son acquire fluency in a number of languages. It was on his return to Scythia that F&/einius ordered Gaedheal to arrange and regulate the Gaelic language (C&/eitinn, 1908, pp. 3013). \n One poet described F&/einius as a:  A man renowned, wise, learned In each language. \n We will describe here a number of ways in which the posterity of F&/einius have coped and are coping with the polyglot realities of the 20th century. \n Translation in the New State \n In the earlier part of this century, translation activity was mainly centred around the Irish language. At the first meeting of D&/ail &/Eireann on the    21st   January 1919 no translation facilities were provided even though all the proceedings were in Irish. However, the need was soon felt for the services of a translator and the first official translator to the D&/ail, M&/iche&/a /O Loinsigh, was appointed in June 1919. In September 1922 a Standing Order of D&/ail &/Eireann stipulated that the texts of legislation be available both in Irish and in English. This led to the setting up of the Translation Section of D&/ail &/Eireann Ronn&/og an Aistri&/uch&/ain. It was the Rann&/og which translated the constitution in 1922 but not in 1937 when it was translated primarily by M&/iche&/al /O Gr&/iofa (Dalt&/un, 1983, pp.12-17). Apart from its translation work, the Rann&/og was also very active in the area of the simplification and standardisation of Irish grammar and spelling. Tom&/as Page 's simplified spelling system <&Irish>  Litri&/u na Gaeilge: l&/amhleabhar and chaighde&/ain  </&Irish> appeared in 1945 and S&/eamas Dalt&/un 's <&Irish>  Gramadach na Gaeilge agus Litri&u na Gaeilge  </&Irish> came out in 1958. Dalt&/un 's book was an instant success with the  Irish Press  at the time headlining  \"1,200 Grammars Sold on First Day\".  \n Ireland 's membership of the European Community in 1973 required that the relevant treaties be translated into Irish, thus representing a new linguistic challenge for the translators in Rann&/og an Aistri&/uch&/ain. It is not always easy, however, for the translators in the Rann&/og, to deal adequately with the sheer volume of translation work that is generated by D&/ail &/Eireann and the European Community. There are only 11 full-time translators working in the Rann&/og at present and they are already 3-4 years behind in translation of government legislation. In indicating the size of the backlog to an Irish Translators Association seminar on the Translator and the Irish Language, Se&/an &/O S&/e, Assistant Chief Translator in D&/ail &/Eireann, also pointed out the unsatisfactory situation at present in the D&/ail where translators from the Rann&/og are expected to act as interpreters if a TD or a member of the Press Corps require interpretation. Given that it is widely acknowledged that translating and interpreting are two distinct skills, the interpretation requirement would seem to place an unfair burden on the Rann&/og 's translators (&/O Murch&/u, 1988 pp. 9-10). The anomalous position of Irish in the European Community where it does not have the status of a working language seriously limits the opportunities available to professional translators in Irish. In terms of the status of Irish language translation and the terminological sophistication resulting from daily contact with other European languages, Irish language translators would stand to benefit greatly from a change in the present situation. \n Literary Translation: A Growth Area \n The Arts Council in recent years has become more actively involved in the area of translation. In particular, it has favoured translation of literature from the Irish language into English with Bord na Leabhar Gaeilge concentrating on backing the publication of translations in Irish. The Arts Council provides support for translations in two ways: (1) Publication Assistance and (2) The Author 's Royalty Scheme. Publication Assistance is the offer of a grant or a loan to assist the publication of a title. The Author 's Royalty Scheme is, among other things, a mechanism for helping publishers commission translations (Cassidy, 1988, p.8). Active support for Irish/English literary translation has led to the publication of a number of translations over the last five years. M&/airt&/in &/O Dire&/ain 's  Selected Poems/Tacar D&/anta  translated by the poet Tom&/as Mac S&/iom&/oin and Douglas Sealy was published by Goldsmith Press in 1984. Nuala N&/i Dhomhnaill 's  Selected Poems/Rogha D&/anta  translated by the poet and Michael Hartnett was brought out by Raven Arts Press in 1986, the same year that Raven published  An Tonn Gheal/The Bright Wave,  a selection of translations by English language poets of poems by writers in Irish. In the area of prose translation Wolfhound Press in 1987 published translations of short stories by Se&/an Mac Math&/una originally written in Irish for his collection  Ding agus sc&/ealta eile.  These appeared in English under the title  The Atheist.  Translation activity has not been confined, however, to translation from Irish (Cronin, 1978, p.8). \n Two publishers have been very much to the fore in publishing translations from other languages, Dedalus Press and Raven Arts Press. Dedalus Press in 1985 published the Swedish poet Toman Transtromer 's  The Wild Market Place  translated by John F. Deane. In 1987 it brought out Michael Smith 's version of poems by Miguel Hernandez in a collection called  Unceasing Lightning  and versions of poems by the Romanian poet Martin Sorescu by John F. Deane entitled  The Youth of Don Quixote.  In 1988, translations of selected poems by the Hungarian poet Agnes Names Nay appeared in a collection published by Dedalus in association with Corvina Press in Budapest. Hugh Maxton was the translator and the title of the collection was  Between.  Raven Arts Press have published translations from German and Dutch;  65 Poems,  selected poems of Paul Celan translated by Brian Lynch and Peter Jankowski (1986) and  Hidden Weddings,  selected poems of Gerrit Achterbert translated by Michael O'Loughlin (1987). \n As well as translation into English there are translations of work into Irish mainly published by An G&/um and smaller publishers such as Coisc&/eim and Cl&/o Iar-Chonnachta. A comprehensive listing of these translations in recent years but an example of the variety of such translation can be seen in some of the titles published in 1987: <&Irish>  Taisce an Oile&/an  (Cl&/o Iar-Chonnachta) </&Irish> by Laurent Escudie and Yann Fanch Jacq, translated from Breton by Uaith&/ear Mac Gearailt, <&Irish>  Saibhreas Chnoic Chaspair  (An G&/um) </&Irish> by J. Selwyn Lloyd, translated from Welsh by Liam Mac C&/oil and <&Irish>  Sneachta  (Coisc&/eim) </&Irish> again by a Welsh author, Mair Wynn Hughes and translated by M&/aire Nic Mhaol&/ain. A relatively new development in literary translation in Ireland has been the translation of works by modern writers in Irish into languages other than English. In 1984, the French publisher Calligrammes published <&French>  Une Ile et d'autres iles.  </&French> This collection contained French translations by &/Eamon &/O Cios&/ain of poems by M&/airt&/in Dire&/ain, P&/adraig Mac Piarais, Se&/an &/O R&/iord&/ain, Eoghan &/O Turaisc, M&/aire Mhac and tSaoi and Caitl&/in Maude. Italian translations of poems by P&/adraig &/O Snodaigh appeared under the title <&Italian>  Solitudine e Compagnia  (Edizioni del Sud, 1987). </&Italian> The translations were by Rosangela Barone and G. Lendaro Camiless. \n Given the level of activity in literary translation in Ireland    at   present and the likelihood of this increasing with greater European integration, there is a need for a coordinated policy with respect to translation from Irish and English into other languages or vice versa. The European Community has already committed itself to a major translation project which will ultimately involve a number of translations from Irish into other European languages each year. The project is at present under consideration by the Arts Council, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Irish Translators Association and is evidence of the increasing internationalisation of literary translation in Ireland. There are obvious advantages as a result of this development; increased prestige for Irish writing in both languages abroad, particularly important in the case of Irish which will have more opportunities to see itself in languages other than English. In addition, translation translation often represents a useful source of income and a valuable training for creative writers. \n Literary Translation: Problems and Possible Solutions \n A policy that would seek to address the difficulties faced by literary translators in Ireland would have to begin with the vexed questions of lack of proper training and poor rates of pay. There are a number of ways in which these problems might be tackled. \n 1.   Literary Translation Programmes.   The University of Dusseldorf runs a training programme for literary translators which involves an obligatory stay at the European Translators College in Straelen on the German-Dutch border. The <French> Ecole Sup&/erieur de Traducteurs-Interpretes Lucien Cooremans (ESTI) </&French> in Brussels has started a two year postgraduate course in literary translation for literary translators working into French. It would seem both desirable and feasible for Irish universities to follow the German and Belgian examples and institute specific courses for those wishing to work in the area of literary translation. The active involvement of experienced literary translators would be crucial to the success of such courses. \n 2.   Translators Colleges.   The aforementioned Translators College in Straelen has 20 apartments and library which contains over 20,000 books including 2,000 dictionaries and encyclopedias. These are at the disposal of literary translators who may stay at the College free of charge. In 1987 <French> \"Le College international des traducteurs litt&/eraires\" </&French> was set up in Arles and there are plans to establish a <Spanish> \"Casa del Traductor\" </&Spanish> in Tarrogon (Spain) and a similar college in Viterbo (Italy). The setting up of a Translators College or Centre in Ireland along the lines of the College in Straelen would be a major boost to literary translation in Ireland. It would give literacy translators a place to work, an access to dictionaries and other reference material and a valuable chance to meet other people working in the same area. Such a project would seem timely in the light of Dublin 's taking on the mantle of the Cultural Capital of Europe of 1991.\n 3.   Low Rates of Pay.   One eminent French specialist of Pushkin complained bitterly that he received approximately 50p per poem for translation that cost him years of work. The story is not untypical of the low rates offered by literary publishers for translations. The usual practice is for the translator to be paid a lump sum for a translation but they very rarely receive any royalties. Thus, even if the book is a bestseller, which can in part be attributed to the quality of the translation, the translator will not receive any further payment. As well as putting pressure on publishers to offer better rates to translators, translators ' associations in Ireland and abroad have argued for the institution of translators royalties thus ensuring that translators benefit from the commercial success of a translated work. \n 4.   Translation Prizes and Bursaries.   Helmut Scheffel, translator and editor of the <German>  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  </&German> pointed out at a symposium on European culture in Paris that literary translation prizes and bursaries are generally awarded to distinguished or eminent translators often towards the end of their career in recognition of work done. Scheffel suggested that bursaries in particular might just as well usefully be awarded to young translators with well defined translation projects (Scheffel, 1988, pp. 285-89). If such bursaries were to exist in Ireland, they would be an important inventive for young translators to get involved in literary translation, thereby securing continuity and quality for the profession.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "569c1986-8e47-4083-9df2-318da91c67a5", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.570393+00:00"}
{"text": "<Romantic nationalism>\n\n\n<$A>\n 'A SHADOWY NARRATOR': HISTORY, ART AND ROMANTIC NATIONALISM IN IRELAND 1750-1850 \n Luke Gibbons II \n Davis 's enlisting of the aura of classical antiquity in the cause of a national art movement is ironical, given that the whole basis of the neo-classic revival in the eighteenth century was that it addressed universal themes, allowing artists to escape the limiting horizons of a particular culture of society. Davis 's reading of Sir Joshua Reynolds 's  Discourses on Art  (1769-90) would have reminded him that in specifying native topics such as 'The Landing of the Milesians' or 'St Patrick brought before the Druids at Tara' (not to mention 'Molyneux 's Book Burned' or 'Tone, Emmet and Keogh') as fit subjects for the gravitas of history painting, he was contravening the precepts of the grand style as outlined in Reynolds 's canonical treatise. In his Fourth Discourse, Reynolds takes issue with Dutch painting for lowering its sights from the general to the particular, and for dwelling on the surface details of local experience rather than the underlying constants of the human condition: \n  The painters of the Dutch school have still more locality. With them, a history-piece is properly a portrait of themselves; whether they describe the inside or outside of their houses, we have their own people engaged in their own peculiar occupations; working, or drinking, playing, or fighting. The circumstances that enter into a picture of this kind, are so far from giving a general view of human life, that they exhibit all the minute particularities of a nation differing in several respects from the rest of mankind... The painters of this school are excellent in their own way; they are only ridiculous when they attempt general history on their own narrow principles, and debase great events by the meanness of their characters.  7   \n In these disparaging remarks on Dutch art, it will be seen that the grounds for discouraging the servile imitation of everyday life also rule out the very possibility of a national art. For Reynolds realism means an attachment to the local, to particular details, and national difference are the political equivalent of the trifles and ephemera of daily existence. The equation of the attention to detail in realist art with the constraints imposed by custom and locality on human nature was part of the common fund of neo-classical wisdom, due mainly to the magisterial influence of Dr Johnson 's critical writings on literature.  8  Painting, however, was better placed than literature to address universal themes, and hence was under greater pressure to distance itself from the confines of local experience. In this lay one of the main obstacles to the appropriation of the visual arts for nationalist ends - the obstacle which Davis attempted to surmount in his forays into art criticism. \n Painting was considered to be well disposed towards the universal for a number of reasons. Primary among these was its deployment of what might be referred to as  'the esperanto of the eye'.  It was a truism in eighteenth-century aesthetics that pictorial expression was not bound by the sort of cultural constraints which limited the intelligibility of language.  'A Picture bears a real Resemblance to its Original, which Letter and Syllables are wholly void of,'  wrote Joseph Addison.  'Colours speak all Languages, but Words are understood only by such a People or Nation.'  9  As critical debates progressed throughout the century, the analysis of the contrasting merits of words and images took the form of aligning language with time, and vision with space: verbal expression facilitated the passage of time through narrative, whereas visual form, by contrast, allowed an exploration of space within the three-dimensional limits of the pictorial frame. In Lessing 's  Laokoon  (1766), one of three great landmarks in the history of aesthetics, this distinction amounted to the virtual exclusion of any sense of temporal succession from pictorial representation, the emphasis instead being placed on heightened action, the kind of elevated moments which compress an event or even a whole epoch into a concentrated point in time.  10  It was in this manner that history painting came to articulate the heroic mode, capturing those turning-points in the affairs of men which constituted the loftiest expressions of human character. Universalism in form and style thus gave rise to the universal in subject-matter. \n The dignified concept of human nature eulogized in history painting owed its origins to a tradition of civic humanism which entered English political discourse from Renaissance political theory. Central to this tradition, as J.G.A. Pocock points out, was a concept of  virtue  based on the classical republican ideal of a dedication to the common good through full participation in political life.  11  The common good in this sense was not to be identified with any particular interest, whether it be that of a private individual or even a particular nation. This was another way of saying it did not exist in the real world but was an ideal, an abstraction from the interests of the various individuals and social groupings which comprised the body politic in the most general understanding of the term. It was at this point that the aspirations of history painting coincided with the republican ideal, for both eschewed the particular in pursuit of a general norm, what John Barrell refers to as  'the republic of taste'.   12  This convergence between the aesthetic and the political, both grounded in a universal humanism, received its classic formulation in Reynolds 's  Discourses:  \n  We pursue the same method in our search after the idea of beauty and perfection in each; of virtue, by looking forwards beyond ourselves to society, and to the whole; of arts, by extending our view in the same manner to all ages and all times.   13  \n Reynolds took his own idealism to heart by admitting candidly that in his practice as a painter, he could not live up to the exalted standards of history painting and hence was forced to make do with portraiture - a self-imposed limitation which was not without its financial rewards. The republic of taste had to await the dawning of revolutionary consciousness in France of the 1780s to find its most forceful political expression. The emblematic images of this intensification of republican ideology are David 's monumental paintings,  The Oath of the Hoaratii  (1784-5) and the  Brutus  of 1789.  The Oath of the Horatii  represents the ultimate affirmation of patriotic virtue: in it the three sons of Horatius pledge loyalty to Rome, even though it entails a fight to the death with their opponents, the Curatii, to whom they are related twice over by marriage. The fatherland takes precedence over the family, in keeping with the anti-domestic bias of history painting. If this exhausted the meaning of the painting, it would be simply a manifestation of patriotism, and hence might even be consistent with a pledge of loyalty to the king (the incident was wet, after all, in the pre-republican period when Rome was still a monarchy). The very fact of invoking a distinguished Roman precedent, however devoid of any historical connection with the present, converted it from being an act of local, political expedience into the kind of universal vindication of the civic ideal that made sense only within republican ideology. This covert republicanism, and subordination of the family (and hence the aristocratic means of transmitting power) to an abstract conception of the state, is made more explicit in David 's  Brutus,  a historical tableaux which pays homage to Lucius Junius Brutus, who sacrificed his own sons in the course of overthrowing the tyrant Tarquinius Superbus, and establishing the Roman republic. It was exhibited in the momentous year of 1789, the strangely absent centre of the painting itself testifying to a world in which the centre could no longer hold. \n It is hardly coincidental that in asserting the constancy of a virtuous human nature, and in devaluing localized expressions of historical change, David 's great set-pieces should transform the (narrative) flow of historical time into abstract configurations of spatial form.  14  The geometrical precision exercised in the arrangement of figures, the angular display of the bodies and the rigorous demarcation of emotional space, all point to the moral equivalent of the metric system, precisely the type of Euclidean politics which Edmund Burke was to equate with the abstract theorizing of republicanism.  15  But the rarefaction of classical republicanism into the austerity of form at both the aesthetic and political levels served another purpose. It denied, as we have seen, a historical link or continuum between ancient Rome and France, suggesting at the most that antiquity furnished moral exemplars rather than the historical foundations of virtuous actions.  16  The neo-classical concept of the past was not bound up with the search for origins or remote ancestry which fired romantic antiquarianism and, by extension, cultural nationalism. Such was the blithe disregard to unearthing the original sources that one imaginative critic, George Turnbull, could devote an entire treatise to a meticulous comparison of the paintings of the great Greek painter Apelles with those of Raphael - despite the fact that not a single trace of Apelle 's work had survived the classical age.  17  From this perspective, the use of the past in republican imagery, or its French variant, at any rate, was not incompatible with a political philosophy which set its eyes firmly on the present, if not the future. As Thomas Crow has argued, the eventual outbreak of the revolution obviated the need to camouflage republican sentiments in antique costume: in David 's  Oath of the Tennis Court  (1791), the Oath of the Horatii is re-enacted on a mass scale as a declaration of the popular will, complete with contemporary dress. 18  As with all forms of idealism, the very success of history painting led to its own dissolution. Its exposure to lived history proved its undoing. \n The cult of antiquity, then, was governed by moral rather than strictly historical imperatives, and it was precisely for this reason that the earliest advocates of the visual arts in Ireland ruled out native mythology and subject-matter from the hallowed precincts of history painting. In his 1767 pamphlet,  An Essay on Perfecting the fine Arts in Great Britain and Ireland,  Thomas Campbell argued that native or traditional culture does not afford a sufficient basis for cultivating  'the learned eye',  or acquiring  'that second sight we call taste'.  The case of music was instructive in this regard. Someone might grow up  'in the country'  appreciating  'the street madrigal or itinerant violin',  but when he was equipped with a genuine musical sensibility,  'what before was melody will now prove discord to him'.   19  Campbell returned to this theme in his acerbic  Philosophical Survey of the South of Ireland,  published ten years later. In the intervening period, his hostility to native culture had somewhat abated - a temporary aberration, as we shall see, and a consequence, perhaps, of the renewed interest in Irish history prompted by the publication of works by Thomas Leland and Sylvester O'Halloran.  20  Campbell defended the claim against the aspersions of historians such as David Hume, that Ireland was one of the oldest civilizations in Europe and was particularly keen to vouch for the Irish credentials of Ossian against the posturings of Macpherson: not alone is there no mention of Ossian in Scottish history, Campbell argued, but his songs are still  'familiar to the aboriginal natives of Ireland'  and are not simply embalmed in historical texts. Yet his enthusiasm for ancient Ireland was qualified, since it lacked those elements of moral purpose and narrative coherence which attracted others to the study of classical antiquity. In pre-Christian Ireland, as depicted in the surviving records: \n  There is no variety of events, no consecutive series of action, no motive to war, or inducements to peace, but the adultery of some queen, the rape of some virgin, or the murder of some chief. In fine, there is no exemplary morality, no colour of just history.  21   \n This was said more in the way of an aside, but Campbell 's commonsense aversion to historical speculation - a trait which grew more emboldened following his acceptance in Dr Johnson 's distinguished literary coterie  22  - led him gradually to consider the avid researches of contemporary Irish antiquarians as having more in common with the fiction of Macpherson than with the dispassionate, polemic published in the changed circumstances of 1789, when the Catholic issue had polarized Protestant public opinion, he ridicules the special pleading of native historians such opinion, he ridicules the special pleading of native historians such as Charles O'Conor and Sylvester O'Halloran who sought to confer respectability on the pre-historic past by arguing, not alone that the ancient Irish were conversant with classical civilization, but that they actually introduced, by virtue of the Phoenician origins, the use of letters to Greece. Such was the credulity of O'Halloran, Campbell writes, that he was prepared to believe that Ireland was entitled  'the island of saints'  even before the coming of Christianity - a perverse misreading on his part of the tag 'insula sacra' which classical commentators applied to Ireland.  23", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "adb3789b-54f8-45b3-87d2-41a639242667", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.571623+00:00"}
{"text": "<Sociology in Belfast>\n\n\n<$A>\n  Madeleine Leonard  \n  'Doing the Double' in Belfast  \n  The Politics of Sensitive Research  \n  SOCIOLOGISTS,  when they carry out research, enter into personal and moral relationships with those they study, be they individuals, households, social groups or corporate entities (BSA Statement of Ethical Practice 1992). These relationships become increasingly problematic where research involves studying topics that are sensitive. According to Sieber and Stanley (1988), socially sensitive research refers to studies in which there are potential consequences or implications, either directly for the participants in the research or for the class of individuals represented by the research. The overall research project to be discussed in this article was concerned with examining the extent and significance of informal economic activity in an estate characterised by high long-term unemployment located in West Belfast. Part of the research involved assessing the extent of welfare benefit fraud within the chosen area. Clearly this aspect of the research can be considered sensitive, as individual respondents or indeed the whole community may be harmed by the results and publication of research. Sensitivity affects almost every stage of the research process from formulation through design to implementation and dissemination (Lee and Renzetti 1990). According to Plummer (1983) sensitive research raises methodological, technical, ethical and political problems, as well as having potential effects on the researcher 's life. This article is concerned with highlighting some of the main problems associated with studying a sensitive issue in a politically sensitive locality. Rather than revealing conclusive answers to the methodological questions that sensitive topics pose to researchers, the article will attempt to add to the growing debate by discussing some of the difficulties faced, and how I addressed them. \n  RESEARCH DESIGN  \n Duelli Klein (1983) points out that  'the \"what\" to investigate must come prior to the decision of \"how\" to go about doing one 's research.'  Clearly, if the issue under investigation is a sensitive one, this restricts the range of methods that can be utilised to study the topic. For example, in researching any group, the question arises immediately as to who or what to sample. However, the more sensitive or threatening the topic, the more difficult sampling is likely to be, because potential participants have greater need to hide their involvement (Renzetti and Lee 1993). Sensitivity renders random sampling impractical. Two of the major strategies that can be used for sampling special populations that are deviant in some way are the location of locales within which sample members are likely to be found and the use of snowballing strategies to gain access to respondents. \n In relation to my research, the estate I focused on was deliberately chosen, as it represented the peak unemployment area in Northern Ireland. The high levels of unemployment which plagued the estate were documented in a number of reports and surveys (e.g. McAuley 1986). Moreover, the estate was the focus for considerable negative media attention, being widely acknowledged as a dumping ground for 'problem' families. This presented a number of moral and ethical problems. While my overall intention was to look at the various forms of informal economic activity prevalent in the estate which fell outside conventional definitions of work as equal to formal employment, it was obvious that some of these activities would border on illegality. This particularly applied to criminal activities and 'doing the double' which refers to working informally whilst simultaneously collecting welfare benefits. Uncovering levels of social security abuse involves potential negative costs to those participating in the research. I was aware from the outset that individuals and indeed the whole community may be harmed by the results of the research. Moreover, perhaps I could be accused of holding preconceived prejudicial attitudes by initially deciding to focus on that area. Negative images of 'scrounging Catholics ' abound in the media and the research could enhance the credibility to these biased viewpoints. Finally, from an ethical viewpoint, have I the right to expose the 'wrongdoings ' of others for the sake of demonstrating the fallacy of equating work with formal employment? There are no easy answers to any of these issues. I could justify my decision to locate the research in the estate by stressing that my choice was mainly motivated by my part-time employment in a community school in the area. Hence I felt that this avenue would enhance my access to the wider community. Whether this justification removes the moral and ethical dilemmas posed by the research is debatable. All the researcher can do is constantly reflect on the heightened responsibilities to respondents in terms of privacy, confidentiality and anonymity where respondents are being asked to reveal incriminating information about themselves. The fact that sensitive topics pose complex issues and dilemmas for researchers does not imply that such topics should not be studied (Lee and Renzetti 1990). As Sieber and Stanley (1988) point out:  ...sensitive research addresses some of society 's most pressing social issues and policy questions. Although ignoring the ethical issues in sensitive research is not a responsible approach to science, shying away from controversial topics simply because they are controversial, is also an avoidance of responsibility.  \n The remainder of this article will deal with the methodological, technical and ethical issues inherent in studying sensitive issues. \n  METHODOLOGICAL AND TECHNICAL ISSUES  \n When dealing with sensitive topics, the researcher has to primarily decide which style of research is best-equipped to overcome respondents ' resistance (Brewer 1993). Bearing in mind the sensitive nature of the topic and the sensitive natures of the estate itself, I felt that a questionnaire which asked about controversial issues such as 'doing the double', especially when put by a stranger, would not only be unreliable because of the reluctance of respondents to give truthful answers, but also could be a potentially dangerous activity. Rather, I felt that qualitative research based on participant observation and extensive unstructured and semi-structured interviews were best suited to my purposes. Brewer (1993) suggests that qualitative methods have special qualities for dealing with controversial topics in sensitive locations, as they entail a gradual and progressive contact with respondents which is sustained over a long period, allowing a rapport to be slowly established. \n My initial and preferred research method was to utilise the snowball sampling technique. Snowball sampling has particular qualities for dealing with deviant populations. Contacts with one or two well-known and trusted people in the area can be utilised to gain access to a wider sample of respondents. Moreover, initial contacts can be actuated to vouch for the researcher. Morrissey  et al.  (1984) suggest that this is the only feasible way of researching social security abuse. Working in the community school within the estate provided me with a number of key informants and I intended to gain access to the wider community by interviewing my informants ' social networks and associates in a snowball pattern. While snowball sampling throws up problems of representativeness, nonetheless I felt that this was the only way I would be able to gain meaningful data on informal economic activity. Throughout my period of working in the community school, I heard countless 'stories' of how various bureaucrats, particularly 'dolebusters', had gained information on the work patterns of the unemployed in the area by pretending to be researchers carrying out door-to-door interviews. These 'stories' were related to me with such frequency that they further increased    my   misgivings about the survey method. \n However, after adopting the approach for one year, I decided to supplement the methodology by carrying out a survey of the area. I became unhappy with the snowball technique for several reasons. Firstly, the method proved very time-consuming. Long periods lapsed between respondents expressing their willingness to pass me through their social networks and these contacts materialising. Even when interviews were arranged, often the setting was the community school rather than the respondents ' households. It seemed logical to my contacts that the community school should serve as an interview base and they stated that this would enhance the willingness of their associates to talk to me as anonymity would be assured. However, I felt that often these interviews took place in an artificial setting and valuable data was lost by separating respondents from their household environment. As time progressed, I became increasingly dissatisfied with the quality of the data I was collecting. Sample sizes were small. Respondents were interviewed mainly in isolation from their households and the wider community. Hence, after one year in the field, I decided to supplement the data I had already collected by carrying out a survey of one in four households in the estate, generating a sample size of 150 households. \n  THE SURVEY  \n One of the most difficult aspects of the survey was walking up the garden paths to the individual houses and convincing the occupants to allow me to come in and interview them. As Homan (1991) points out, the interviewer on the doorstep stands at the frontier of private space. I often felt like a salesperson trying to sell some unwanted and unnecessary item. In gaining access to households and obtaining information, I was greatly assisted by the fact that I originally came from a Catholic working-class area in West Belfast, situated about two miles from the area studied (although I might add that until my employment in the community school, I had never been inside the estate where the research took place). Burton (1978) illustrates how the process of 'telling' permeates social relationships among Catholics and Protestants in Belfast. 'Telling' is the patterns of signs and cues by which religious ascription is arrived at in everyday interactions of Protestants and Catholics. It is based on the social significance attached to, among other things, name, face, dress, area of residence and school attended. Burton (1978) argues that, in particular, the area one lives in, is of paramount importance for the Belfast working class. Hence interviews were often preceded by attempts by respondents to pry into my background. I must admit that I welcomed these intrusions into my personal life and indeed often initiated conversations around issues which enabled me to establish some sort of co-membership with individual respondents. \n Feminist researchers (Oakley 1981, Kennedy Bergen 1993) advocate the use of self-disclosure or reciprocity on the part of the researcher as a means of overcoming participants ' inhibitions. Once it was established that I was one of them, trust and confidence were often secured. On the other hand, this relationship places greater responsibility on the researcher and intensifies the ethical issues concerned with studying both a sensitive topic in a politically sensitive area. \n  PRAGMATIC COMPROMISES  \n I told all respondents that I was using a pseudonym for the estate and that while this would enhance anonymity, I could give no guarantees that the location would remain secret. Barnes (1979) argues that a pseudonym only offers a partial disguise. Most individuals are able to recognise themselves and through time one 's colleagues come to share the secret of where the research was based. However, Barnes argues that even if a disguise is transparent, it may still serve a useful purpose in that it may shield the area from casual approach. Identities remain uncertain and ambiguous and this may provide some useful protection if a powerful outsider tries to use the research as evidence against the respondents. I also gave assurances that pseudonyms would be used to describe all persons mentioned in the data. Hence individual identities would remain anonymous, except perhaps to co-residents in the estate, who may recognise individual identities in the final report. Thus no space existed on the questionnaires for the names and addresses of respondents and this was illustrated to each household. This proved important, as on several occasions I was stopped and searched by army patrols in the area, in full view of the residents of the estate. Taylor (1988) argues that, at various times, researchers have been forced into hiding or have had to leave Northern Ireland, due to unfounded fears that research materials were finding their way to the security forces. The above incident served as a timely, though unnecessary reminder, of the highly-politicised natures of the social field within which the research was located. Throughout the survey, I had to make a number of pragmatic compromises which departed from the textbook portrayal of ideal research practice. Brewer (1993) suggests that when research involves sensitive locations and/or topics, the pragmatic compromises multiply in number and in the degree of departures from ideal practice. Given these considerations, the main method utilised was the loosely structured interview, using an interview schedule containing mainly open-ended questions. I decided to omit direct questions on the illegal aspects of informal economic activity from the interview schedule. Rather I hoped to introduce this aspect casually during my interaction with the respondents. Brannen (1988) suggests that researchers into sensitive topics need to tread warily, particularly at the beginning of interviews, and not reveal all their hand at the outset. She further states that it is important not to prejudge the research problem by labelling it or defining its boundaries too closely; respondents may thereby define the problem in their own terms. Hence, in relation to this study, while all the interviews were structured by an interview schedule, the natural progression of the conversation dictated the final nature of the interviews. The interviewing proved to be a very time-consuming process. When interviewing, my intention was to allow the research topic to emerge gradually in its own terms. This often meant that respondents would become totally absorbed in talking about their own lives. Often the issues covered were not directly related to my research interests. In these    circumstances   , my inclination was not to interrupt. As a result, often respondents would give away telling information about themselves which sometimes was at odds with earlier responses, especially those given in answer to direct questions. Moreover, during the conversations, I wanted to adopt as unobtrusive a role as possible. Therefore I felt that writing down everything that was said would interrupt the natural flow of the conversations. Hence while responses to direct questions were noted, conversations were generally trusted to memory. Rather only key words and phrases were jotted down. Usually interviews were only carried out one at a time. Once the interview ended, I left the estate immediately to write down the informal conversation. This was due to distortion in memory recollections. Again this meant that the process was very time consuming. Interviews lasting three or four hours were not uncommon and this was generally followed by a number of hours spent recalling conversations. \n  COMMON PROBLEMS  \n The approach outlined above throws up other problems. The flexible manner in which the interviews were carried out may have implications for the reliability of the material gathered. In some households I sensed an atmosphere of suspicion and hostility and felt it unwise to motivate discussions on the illegal aspects of informal economic activity. In this respect, the interviews were not consistent and valuable data may have been lost due to my personal interpretation of the situation. The final account of the research makes much of the informal conversations I had with the respondents. The problem remains, to what extent can I utilise these informal conversations as trustworthy data? There is no easy solution to this problem. While there was a high level of internal consistency within the data encouraging me to treat the data as provisionally reliable, nonetheless I do not want to reduce the issue here to a simple claim of truth in repetition. At the end of the day, whether or not the approach was successful or not is best left to the judgment of the reader of the overall account.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6c716f2b-8941-45ef-94d0-d0fbdd41de59", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.572804+00:00"}
{"text": "<Ulster home rule>\n\n\n<$A>\n Churchill, Castledawson, and the Covenant \n The Home Rule Bill was introduced in the House of Commons on 11 April 1912. The government remained formally committed to the principle of Irish unity. Over the next few weeks, however, some ministers - in particular Winston Churchill - sent out conciliatory signals in the direction of the Ulster unionists. The background is of some interest. On 3 October 1911 Churchill had referred contemptuously to the  'frothings of Sir Edward Carson'.  He offered to address a pro-home rule demonstration in the Ulster Hall in Belfast on 8 February 1912, a venue where his father had once delivered a famous loyalist speech. The Irish unionist leadership, considering itself to be grievously provoked, openly committed itself to preventing such a meeting in the Ulster Hall, though not elsewhere in the city and the hall was aggressively double-booked. The message was clear: at this early stage in the crisis, Sir Edward Carson, a former Law Officer, was prepared to support irregular proceedings which might well lead to violence.  1  He also revealed himself as being increasingly  'Ulsterized'  in his political instincts, for the exposed minority of southern unionists were worried by this apparent lack of respect for the principle of free speech. In the end, Churchill moved his meeting to Celtic Park and a very tense day passed off peacefully, except for a  'rush of irresponsible rowdies'  towards Churchill 's car.  2  But, as the  Irish Times , which had disliked the methods employed  'on ethical grounds' , noted, the strength of Ulster unionist sentiment had been made clear:  'Churchill 's visit had merely served to emphasise facts which the Radical and Nationalist leadership were desperately anxious to conceal.'  3   Sections of the Liberal leadership began to take Sir Edward Carson and his movement a good deal more seriously. \n At the end of March 100,000 nationalists attended a pro-home rule demonstration in Dublin.  'As decent a crowd of its kind'  that could be  'found anywhere in the empire' , the  Irish Times  charitably claimed on 1 April. Joe Devlin declared that, in comparison with this demonstration,  'the march past of the awkward squads in Belfast would be as a farthing candle in the sunshine'.  John Dillon proclaimed:  'The work of Oliver Cromwell is nearly undone.'  John Redmond struck a more positive note:  'The true purpose of [home rule] ... is to put an end ... to the disastrous and ruinous war which has gone on between Ireland and the Empire.'  In early April the awkward squads gave their reply in Belfast: 100,000 unionists were present at Balmoral. Carson introduced Bonar Law, who was accompanied by seventy MPs from English and Scottish constituencies. According to the  Irish Times  on 10 April:  'The most important feature was the turn out of the Unionist clubs. The Orangemen are accustomed to processions ... there were thousands of others standing witness to their determination of their adherence to the cause of the union. [This is] ... a direct answer to any taunting allegation that resistance to home rule is a fanatical movement fostered solely by the Orange Order.'  On 11 June T.G.R. Agar-Roberts, a Cornish Liberal MP suggested in the House of Commons the desirability of excluding the four heavily Protestant counties: Antrim, Down, Armagh, and Londonderry. The unionists supported the Agar-Roberts amendment, but it was defeated on 14 June by 69 votes. This indicated a certain fall in government support. Carson chose to regard the defeat as  'a declaration of war',  others felt that a reluctant government had been forced to act against its most profound inclination. The  Irish Times  noted simply:  'It has been compelled to change its mind by Mr Redmond.'  4   This was the context of a most dangerous development - a slide into large-scale sectarian communal violence in Ulster. The unionists, albeit reluctantly, had been prepared to offer serious consideration to a scheme of partition: the government, or some of its members and supporters, had flirted with the idea and then turned away from it.  5  \n On 29 June, a serious affray at Castledawson, County Londonderry, initiated a marked deterioration in the intercommunal relations. A Presbyterian Sunday School excursion party largely composed of women and children and numbering about 500, was attacked by on William Craig, a member of a Hibernian bank which unluckily happened to be returning from a Maghera demonstration. (At Maghera, ironically, there had been Protestant home rulers on the platform and much non-sectarian oratory.) Craig dashed into the excursion party and seized a small Union Flag, attempting to drag it from a small boy who held on to it. The local RIC officer, Sergeant Burchill, pushed Craig back, and was struck by several of the Hibernians. A general row ensued, the excursion party was thrown into a confused mass, and blows were struck on both sides. The violence escalated: there was large-scale stone-throwing and many of the Protestants armed themselves with forks, shovel shafts, and sticks. The police decided to take decisive action: they brought out their rifles and fixed their swords. Ruefully, the two antagonistic crowds decided to disband, but not before many of the children were terrified out of their wits. \n Tales of the incident soon spread. Inflamed Protestants regarded this attack upon children as an indication of the baseness of nationalist intent. Catholics felt that the incident had been greatly exaggerated by local Protestants; in particular, they criticized the role of the Revd Robert Barren, who had been superintending the Presbyterian excursion. The Belfast presbytery indignantly repudiated charges of exaggeration. The  Witness  declared of Castledawson:  'Its real importance lies in the view that it points to the difference between the Hibernians and other nationalists and their professed leaders.... We have said that it did not matter what the leaders said: it was what the rank and file thought and said which should be the dominating factor. 6  At the same time there was undoubtedly a certain exploitation of the Castledawson affray. When the Revd J. D. Craig Houston told the Presbyterian assembly that they should not use the outrage for political purposes,  'So we do!'  cried the ranks of this normally staid body.  7  For offences connected with Castledawson twenty-three Hibernians and seven Protestant defendants were convicted and each sentenced to a term of three months ' imprisonment with hard labour for riot and unlawful assembly. The seven Protestant defendants in the same case were acquitted.  8  For Protestants this verdict proved where the responsibility lay; for Catholics it proved merely the partiality of the judiciary. On 8 January 1913 a Memorial praying for remission of the unexpired period of the sentence imposed on the Hibernians was signed by a large number of Castledawson residents of all classes and professions - unionists, Conservatives, nationalists, Orangemen, Liberals, and clergymen of all denominations - and sent to the Lord Lieutenant. Amongst the signatories were the Revd Mr Tarleton, rector of Castledawson, the Revd Mr Lindsay, rector of Magherafelt, and Alexander Clarke, JP, the proprietor of the large linen factory at Castledawson. The signatories were surprisingly representative on a cross-community basis: there were six Catholic clergymen as against three Protestants, but, on the other hand, there were ten unionist professional men as against nine Catholics. Given the immense bitterness occasioned by the incident in the Protestant community, it is important to note that the spirit of harmony and conciliation was by no means extinguished. The complete synopsis  9  of the signatures to the Memorial in the table below makes interesting reading. \n\n Mr Justice Wright, who presided at the trial, in reporting on the Memorial, expressed his opinion that there could be no doubt of the righteousness of the verdict, adding that he had carefully considered the case before passing sentence and that he saw no reason to recommend any reduction of the sentence of three months ' imprisonment with hard labour which he had imposed. This was not a sentiment which was shared at the highest level in Dublin Castle. On 4 February the Lord Lieutenant, with the support of the Chief Secretary, made an order that the twenty-three prisoners convicted and sentenced should be released on 5 February 1913: they had served only half their sentences. The  Weekly Northern Whig  bitterly noted in an editorial of 15 February;  'Stripped of all casuistry the plain fact remains that the Government is under the thumb of the Hibernians.'  The pamphlet  Ulster Protest  added:  'Such is the meaning of Mr Redmond 's perfectly true statement that Mr Devlin is the real Chief Secretary of Ireland.'  \n Few, however, believed that the government had acted purely out of considerations of abstract legality. The political context is all too clear: the by-election in Londonderry City on 30 January 1913 was narrowly carried by the Scottish Presbyterian Liberal, David Clegthorn Hogg, a large local employer, over Lt. Col. Hercules Arthur Pakenham (unionist) by 2,699 votes to 2,642. Not surprisingly, the Irish party presented the victory and the choice of a Presbyterian candidate as great proof of the non-sectarianism of Catholic politics. At Hogg 's celebratory dinner, Redmond offered a limited olive branch to unionists - he was prepared to offer them an influence in an Irish parliament greater than their numbers warranted. Such rhetoric was soon to be undermined by allegations in the  Pall Mall Gazette  concerning the inner history of the Derry election. It was claimed that the Hibernian factions in the city had made a deal with the government before they consented to vote for the Liberal candidate.  11  Patrick Arkins, a Clare peasant sent down for seven years by Justice Dodd for an agrarian offence (knocking down a wall), was to be set free after three months; also to be freed were the Castledawson prisoners. The government kept the bargain - shortly after the Derry result Arkins and the    Castledawson   men were released. Perhaps Birrell had not entirely suppressed his memory of these events when he referred drily in his memoirs to the  'near impossibility'  of any English government dispensing  'even handed justice'  12   in Ireland. \n But long before their eventual release the behaviour of the Castledawson nationalists had rebounded negatively on the nationalist minority in Belfast. As the stories of Castledawson reached Belfast, loyalists contemplated savagely the attack on their women and children: some of the children at Castledawson were those of Belfast shipyard workers.  13  Inflamed, some at once turned to violence and revenge. From July onwards, at the shipyards and in their immediate vicinity, assaults were committed on Catholics and also on Protestant liberals and home rulers. These assaults were so serious and there was such a degree of intimidation of Catholic workers that about 2,000 of them left their employment at the shipyards. When the July holidays (the 'Twelfth') started, not more than a hundred Catholics remained in the shipyard. 14  Southern unionists were embarrassed by the events. They felt themselves to be in  'a sense outsiders',  15   , confronted by such  'inflexible contempt of opponents'.   'It is not for us to live as vividly in the past or map the future with such arrogant confidence.'   16  \n It was hoped that passions would diminish over the July holidays, but this did not happen. By the end of July Harland and Wolff (whose owner Lord Pirrie was a recent convert to home rule from the ranks of liberal unionism) felt compelled to act; it threatened to lay off its entire 17,000-strong workforce unless the Catholic workers were re-admitted.  17  George Clark, the managing director of Workman and Clark, which employed 9,000, appeared to be less sympathetic to the plight of the Catholic workforce: they had been  'easily frightened'   18  he declared tactlessly. This provoked the  Leader  to a bitter attempt at verse in mid-February 1914:  The senior director of Workman and Clark This lack of true grit in the Papists did mark He deemed that each Papist in courage was slack Who left with a murderous mob at his back.  \n Workman and Clark was not the only firm to attract such critical comment. The Sirocco engineering works appeared to be equally culpable.  19  A South Bucks. working man 's delegation reported eighteen months later:\n On Thursday [29 January] our first visit was to the Sirocco Works, where we were received by Mr Davidson, the proprietor. He remarked that only about fifty Catholics were employed, and explained that in consequence of the shipyard and other disturbances in 1912, he made an arrangement with the Protestants that if they agreed to work with the older hands among his Catholic employees he would employ more in the future. The unionist workmen, Mr Davidson assured us, kept him regularly to this bargain.  20   \n Both George Clark and S. C. Davidson were to serve on the Financial and Business Committee of the Ulster provisional government: on the other hand Lord Pirrie 's threat cooled passions and led to an improvement: many Catholic employees felt able to return to work. But as late as 28 September 1912 the  Weekly Freeman 's Journal  noted sadly:  'It must be remembered, however, that none of the expelled Catholics and Home Rulers have been taken back at Workman and Clark 's. Some time ago it was rumoured that some had gone back there but it appears the rumour was groundless.'  There was to be a messy and unsatisfactory aftermath in the courts. The police noted:  'The various cases for the disturbance at the shipyards and other places during the summer of 1912 were heard at the Assizes this month. Notwithstanding that the judge charged strongly in each case for a conviction most of the defendants were acquitted.'  21   Unsurprisingly many nationalists contrasted this leniency with the fate of the Castledawson Hibernians.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "9523304a-942e-422e-929e-6469a31537fe", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.574015+00:00"}
{"text": "<Work and welfare>\n\n\n<$A>\n Part time work \n From the point of view of unemployed men 's labour supply, 'flexibility' about moving off the unemployment register and into part time work cannot be separated from the question of pay flexibility or inflexibility. At the time of study, family income supplement could only be claimed if the person was working more than 30 hours per week. Since April 1988 family credit can be paid to those working more than 24 hours per week. This means that a man (or woman) could now take a 'part time' job of 24-30 hours per week and claim family credit whereas he or she could not have claimed family income supplement. However, this would entail a very heavy reliance on family credit: that is, it would make up a high proportion of total income (40-50 per cent, for example). As the previous section showed, this is not a situation which is perceived positively by unemployed people. Family credit as a 'top-up' of <*> pound sign </*> 10- <*> pound sign </*> 20 a week is an acceptable risk, but family credit as half of one 's income is perceived as a high risk strategy. \n Men could, of course, take up part time work and remain on income support. In doing so, their earnings are then considered as a top-up of benefit and come under the disregarded earnings provision of income support. Nationally, and in this study, use of disregarded earnings provision is low (11 per cent in this study and about 5 per cent of unemployed people on income support nationally in 1989, (DSS, 1989). The net effect of male unemployment in these couples was to discourage wives from taking up or keeping on part time work and to discourage men from taking up part time work (less than 24 hours a week) while unemployed. \n At the time of this study, unemployed couples could each earn up to <*> pound sign </*> 4 per week net of work expenses before their supplementary benefit was affected, and thereafter deductions were pound for pound. Under income support, this has since been raised to <*> pound sign </*> 5 a week each, inclusive of work expenses, for the first two years of unemployment, and a joint <*> pound sign </*> 15 a week thereafter. Most couples had some basic knowledge of the arrangements for disregarded earnings, though they were much less likely to know that under supplementary benefit the figure was net of work expenses. The reason why most did not exploit disregarded earnings was that the return was too small particularly when weighed against possible disruptions to benefit receipt. Most people felt it was unlikely that they could find a job paying just the level of disregarded earnings and thus were aware that they would have to take a job paying more and have deductions from their benefit. Some had done this in the past and they had experienced a considerable amount of 'hassle' from their local social security office as a consequence. Benefit was totally stopped while proof of earnings were sought, deductions greater than earnings minus <*> pound sign </*> 4 (or more rarely <*> pound sign </*> 4 plus work expenses) were made, and so on. Because of the low incomes claimants had and the fragility of managing on low incomes, such disruptions were serious matters indeed and experience of them prevented the take-up of subsequent part time work. Even those without direct experience of such 'hassle' were aware that any change of circumstances carried a high risk of disruption in the receipt of benefits, and could readily imagine the 'hassle' that would ensue from earning more than the disregards limit. The net gain from such 'hassle' was considered too low when weighed against the high risk of benefit disruption. \n Not only did this result in very few families enhancing their living standards by combining some earnings with benefit receipt, but it also had an indirect effect on couples ' labour supply in relation to other forms of work. As the previous section has shown, the strategy adopted was one of the 'family wage' earned by one partner, with possibly a relatively small top-up of in-work benefits. Because wives were generally not employed when their husbands were unemployed, husbands were attempting to find full time jobs which would pay enough to keep the whole family rather than finding lower paid full time or part time jobs supplemented or complemented by wives ' earnings. Such a strategy thus raised the wage (or income) sought by unemployed men. It was difficult for the families to envisage adopting a strategy based on two low or part time wages because this would have required both partners to find jobs simultaneously. \n Temporary, seasonal and casual work \n Labour supply flexibility of unemployed men and women in respect of temporary, seasonal and casual work was also affected by the structure and administration of the social security system. Skilled men and men in rural areas in particular were aware that there were opportunities for full time work of short duration, usually one to three weeks. Women were aware that there were temporary, often seasonal (either Christmas or summer/holiday relief, typically 4-8 weeks), work opportunities, both full time and part time, which they were not seeking. Why was this the case? \n If such work was not to be treated as disregarded earnings (in the same way that regular small amounts of part time work are), then the only option was to sign off benefits completely, work for a short time, and then make a fresh claim. There were a number of problems with such a strategy. Firstly, because such work was of short durations (and often low paid), in-work benefits could play no role from a practical point of view. Secondly, new claims for income support can and frequently do take several weeks to be processed (rarely, at least in the experience of these claimants, are claims processed and paid within one or two weeks). \n As a result, signing-off and signing-on again carried a high risk of being followed by a period with no income. The earnings offered by casual and temporary work were unlikely to be high enough to carry the family through an 'incomeless' period, and the net return from such an exercise was likely to be a loss, zero or very little gain indeed. \n Two alternatives to this strategy were possible, the first of which was to remain nominally on income support and have one 's earnings disregarded. As with part time work, this carried a high risk of loss of benefit and/or delay of benefit accompanied by only a small net return. The second alternative was not to declare such work. This alternative had been adopted by a small number of people in the study: 5 out of 110 had some undeclared earnings and 3 more had had undeclared earnings in the past. Most undeclared earnings were either highly variable from week to week or took the form of occasional lump sums for specific jobs. In contrast, the arrangements for disregarding earnings were very inflexible indeed, calculated as they are on the basis of regular weekly earnings, of the same amount each week. \n Summary \n The position as regards labour supply flexibility of unemployed men and the wives of unemployed men can be summarised as follows. Men and women were flexible as regards the type of work they were prepared to do. But men did not seek or apply for 'women 's jobs'. The main reason they did not do so was the very low pay involved: 'women 's jobs' generally paid less than even unskilled 'men 's jobs' in the same economic sectors. Men did apply for low paid jobs and they applied for jobs which paid less than their reservation wages and less than average earnings for the type of work concerned. They did not, however, apply for very low paid full time jobs. The men attempted to earn close to a family wage, with in-work benefits acting as a top-up or small supplement, not as a 'partner' to earnings, and women 's earnings did not enter the picture at all. This was because women were not likely to work part time while their husbands were unemployed because of the low level of earnings rules and the risks of benefit disruption if more than the limit was earned, while women were unlikely to achieve anything near to a 'family wage' from full time work. Flexibility in respect of full time, part time and short duration work was thus constrained by the structure of benefits. The result was that, despite the fact that most men and women wanted to work and barely managed on their benefit incomes, the majority of families had no work or earnings whatsoever, were largely excluded from the 'flexible' work forms increasingly prevalent in their local labour markets, and were unable to respond positively to the higher level of demand for female than male labour. \n THE ROLE OF SOCIAL SECURITY POLICY IN THE 1990's LABOUR MARKET \n Major constraints on flexible participation in the labour market therefore arise not from the intransigence or inflexibility of claimants but from the reform, including the April 1988 social security reforms (which the relevant Green Paper hailed as the most fundamental review since Beveridge), has done virtually nothing to remove these inherent rigidities. Policy for the foreseeable future appears to be based largely on what has gone before, pervaded by a distinction between full time and part time work which has become more and more artificial. \n More of the same \n In the last two reviews of supplementary benefit, the main constraint on encouraging part time work by extending provision for disregarded earnings has been expressed by government as the danger of undermining incentives for full time work. The result has been that the concern not to undermine full time work incentives has in fact undermined part time work incentives - in some labour markets the only incentives that have any practical meaning - with the result that few unemployed families do any paid work. \n The higher level of disregard of <*> pound sign </*> 15 per benefit unit after 2 years of unemployment introduced in 1988 is in nominal terms more generous than the previous disregard, although not in real terms (Bradshaw, 1985), and work-related expenses can no longer be discounted. For those (mainly wives) doing regular part time work the higher disregard will mean that fewer hours need be spent working for nothing, although <*> pound sign </*> 15 represents no more than a day 's work and 2 years have to pass before even this much is retained. For those, usually men, whose earnings take the form of episodic lump sums exceeding the value of the disregard in the week they are earned, the incentive not to declare them or not to participate in such work will hardly be any less. \n In the context of increasing labour market flexibility and increases in long term unemployment, a more appropriate policy response would be to calculate disregarded earnings over much longer periods in recognition of the fact that it is not always possible to earn small amounts every week. For those who are able to take up occasional work opportunities as they arise, such a system would allow them to support themselves from earnings when work is available without sacrificing the support of benefit when it is not. If that were the case, some undeclared earnings might be regularised and brought into the open. \n In addition to the marginal extension of disregards of part time work, a second theme in recent policy has been the promotion of in-work benefits. This promotion of in-work benefits was foreshadowed in 1988 training White Paper (DE, 1988, p.31) which identified the greater use of these benefits as a source of public expenditure savings by encouraging more of the unemployed to consider low paid work with earnings supplemented by benefits. The aim, then, is to reduce the level of wages sought by unemployed people with children by encouraging the view that wages are not the only component of in-work income. Claimant advisers in the Employment Service have been given the task of promoting the consideration of in-work benefits by unemployed people and an extensive television and poster advertising campaign began in August 1988.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "12760752-3beb-427b-aa9f-4aaa95829ffe", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.575109+00:00"}
{"text": "<Voting systems>\n\n\n<$A>\n Electoral boundaries and vote counting \n The Government of Ireland Act did not create an independent body responsible for the conduct of elections or the supervision of electoral boundaries. The Northern Ireland Parliament had power to regulate its own elections; but it could not increase the number of members and in any redistribution it was bound to pay due regard to the population of constituencies. For local government election, county boroughs and boroughs could recommend their own ward structure. The county council electoral divisions had to be as nearly equal in population as convenient, with regard to changes since the last census and the pursuits of the urban and rural population. The Local Government Act (NI) 1922 added rateable valuation to the factors to be considered. In addition, the redistribution of Parliamentary seats in 1917 provided a body of practical guidance on procedure. \n The adequacy of these provisions was tested throughout the period. Disputes over electoral boundaries were the main feature of the electoral debate between the Unionist government and opposition parties. They emphasized the different expectations over territorial versus communal representation. The detailed nature of the disputes precludes anything other than a cursory review of the main types and periods of dispute. \n  The single-member Stormont constituencies formed in 1929  \n When it became clear that the Unionist government would abolish PR before the end of the second Parliament, opposition parties demanded a Commission to redistribute seats. Nationalists feared that the opportunity would be taken to reduce their members from ten to six; Labour members asserted that failure to establish a Commission would be proof of an intent to gerrymander. However, the request was rejected in 1927 and when the Bill was introduced in 1929 the Prime Minister Viscount Craigavon (James Craig) stressed his personal responsibility for it. \n During the debate there were some claims for communal rather than territorial representation; some Nationalists were willing to accept the termination of PR in return for the guarantee of sixteen seats or representation on the basis of religion. Nationalists claimed that the redistribution scheme gerrymandered Antrim and Fermanagh by taking away a seat from them in Antrim and giving Unionists two seats in Fermanagh. Craigavon replied that it was impossible to create a Nationalist seat of sufficient size in Antrim and that the joint representation of Fermanagh and Tyrone would continue the same as under two PR elections in 1921 and 1925.  8  \n Nationalist fears were not realised in the 1929 election, and they won eleven seats. During the third reading Joseph Devlin, leader of the Nationalist Party, had stated that it was the duty of the government to ensure that the minority would be worse off under the new scheme. In effect this had been accomplished with some rough justice in Fermanagh and Antrim. If there was gerrymandering in 1929 it was of an honest variety. \n From a technical point of view, no constituency lay outside the normal range of plus or minus one-third of the population quota for the forty-eight territorial constituencies or the range within the multi-member constituency from which they were derived. Only two technical issues seem to have occurred - whether to give Fermanagh two or three seats and the West Belfast area four or five seats. Both issues were resolved by favouring the easier course and retaining intact the registration areas of 1920. \n  Ward changes in Omagh, Londonderry and Armagh  \n In the mid-1930s inquiries were held in Omagh UDC and Londonderry County Borough as a result of ratepayers ' associations seeking improved representation. The ratepayers ' associations were thinly disguised and were in effect Unionist. Although their ward plans were rejected in both instances, the effect of subsequent ministry favoured the spirit of the proposals. The proposals for Omagh resulted in a change of party control to Unionist and in Londonderry the three-ward structure ensured a permanent Unionist majority when it would have disappeared in a few years under the five-ward system.  9  In addition, Armagh UDC was dissolved for maladministration in 1934, and when it was returned to council control it was with a boundary extension and a new five-ward structure which reflected the new Unionist majority in the city. \n  The failure to establish Boundary Commissions after 1945  \n After the Second World War, Northern Ireland did not follow Britain in making provision for periodic boundary commissions for Stormont Parliamentary constituencies. Indeed, the nationalist gerrymander motion became a hardy annual at Stormont. Allegations against Stormont constituencies gradually faded as the smallest constituencies became occupied by opposition party candidates while huge Unionist constituencies built up on the fringes of Belfast. Labour members and some of the Unionists with large constituencies began to demand a Commission early in the 1960s. The principle was accepted in 1966 and an Interim Boundary Commission was created in 1968 to create four new territorial seats to replace the university seats. The Electoral Law Act 1968 created a permanent Boundary Commission for Parliamentary seats but it had not reported before direct rule in 1972. \n Allegations against local authority areas persisted. The demand for 'one vote, one value' was part of the civil rights demands enshrined in the shorthand slogan 'one man, one vote'. Boundaries for the new system of District Councils, recommended by the Macrory Report of 1970,  10  and the electoral areas within them, were determined by an independent commission. These single-member units were subsequently grouped into multi-member units when PR was reintroduced in 1973. The Local Government Act (NI) 1972 provided for a Local Government Boundary Commission to report every ten years. \n To summarize, the number and intensity of disputes over electoral boundaries made it the main area of electoral grievance. Part of the problem concerned the absence of independent procedures but the main period of dispute occurred before the Second World War when independent bodies did not exist in the rest of the United Kingdom. Although there were allegations of widespread gerrymandering, research enables attention to be directed to specific areas: Londonderry County Borough, Omagh UDC, Omagh RDC and possibly County Fermanagh. The two Omagh decisions may have produced wider consequences for control of the county council. However, claims about electoral boundaries are difficult to disentangle, particularly where there was an expectation that territorial representation should produce what only communal representation was capable of achieving. The experience of Fermanagh after 1973 is a cautionary tale. There, despite all the changes, unionists disputed control in the 1970s, lost it in the early 1980s but regained control in 1989 with a one-seat majority over eleven nationalists. \n  The method of election  \n The Government of Ireland Act 1920 extended the use of STV in multi-member constituencies from local government elections, under the 1919 Act, to elections for the Northern Ireland Parliament. In the debates it was described as one of the safeguards for minorities and the unionist minority in the South and West of Ireland seemed to be uppermost in debate. However, northern unionists opposed the method and wanted to retain the same system as in Britain. James Craig had opposed PR and committed the party to abolishing it at the first opportunity. On the other hand, Nationalists favoured the principle but they had only six members at Westminster and their attention was directed against the principle of two legislatures in Ireland rather than their composition and elections. \n The method of election to the Northern Ireland Parliament was guaranteed for a period of three years. However, the 1920 Act did not mention local government and on 31 May 1922 the Local Government (NI) Bill was introduced in the Stormont Parliament to abolish PR in local government elections and return to the previous method and electoral units. The six Nationalist and six Sinn Fein members elected in 1921 were pursuing an abstention policy so that the only opposition to the Bill was from a Unionist Labour member, Thompson Donald. Nationalist-controlled councils issued a resolution of protest but the Bill passed its third reading on 5 July. However, as was mentioned in Chapter 1, the Royal Assent was withheld until 11 September. \n Various government statements had encouraged the belief that PR would be abolished for Stormont elections as soon as the three-year statutory prohibition ended in June 1924. However, no action was taken and the 1925 election was also fought using PR. After the election, the Prime Minister came under pressure from the Unionist Party to abolish PR and the Party had lost seats to the Labour Party and other candidates. \n The principle of PR was extensively debated in 1927 on a Labour Party motion. Labour regarded abolition of PR as aimed at all minorities, while Nationalists considered that they were the prime targets. In a lengthy and detailed speech the Prime Minister said that he believed in the two-party system and the old method of elections would produce  'men who are for the Union on the one hand or are against it and want to go into a Dublin Parliament on the other.'   11  The debate hinged less on the merits of PR than on a disposition to treat the minority well through seat distribution. \n PR was abolished by the House of Commons (Method of Voting and Redistribution of Seats) Act (NI) 1929. During the debates the opposition parties expressed diverse views about whom the Bill was directed against. There was less debate on the merits of PR than in 1927 and a greater concern about the consequences of redistributing the seats from the multi-member constituencies. The Bill became law on 16 April 1929 and the 'cross' vote for single-member districts was restored for the forty-eight territorial seats. In the 1929 Northern Ireland Parliament elections thirty-seven Unionists, eleven Nationalists, three Independent Unionists and one Northern Ireland Labour Party member were elected. All the parties previously represented retained representation: Unionists and Nationalists gained over the 1925 results and Labour lost two seats. Apart from an increase in the number of unopposed returns in 1929 there seemed little to choose between the two methods of election. However, the steady increase in the number of independent and unofficial Unionist candidates during the 1930s, culminating in 1938 when more than a quarter of the candidates came from that section, meant that the abolition of PR was aimed at divisions within Unionism over social and economic policy and administrative performance. \n The effect of the change to the simple-majority system and single-member constituencies from 1929 to 1969 can be briefly summarized. The two largest parties, the Unionists and Nationalists, both benefited in their share of contested seats and unopposed returns. The Northern Ireland Labour Party and splinter Unionist candidates were consistently underrepresented. Anti-partition Labour candidates consistently benefited from the system after 1938, but this may have been due to the size of the constituencies contested. All other groups were underrepresented in proportion to their share of the votes. \n In the post-war period there were motions for the reintroduction of PR in 1947 and 1951. During the Electoral Law Bill debates of 1962 Nationalists sought PR but without success. It was only after 'one man, one vote' had been conceded in the Electoral Law (No 2) Bill 1969 that the call for PR was seriously renewed, to the discomfiture of the government. Every opportunity was taken to press for PR and the issue was debated in March 1971. However, the withdrawal of the SDLP and Nationalists from the House in July 1971 and the suspension of the Northern Ireland Parliament and government on 30 March 1972 terminated the Parliamentary debate. The principle was conceded by the Secretary of State, William Whitelaw, as the means to gain SDLP participation in the District Council and Assembly elections of 1973.  12  The Secretary of State never gave any substantial reason for the change except to say that it was the method that most parties mentioned to him. Several years later he stated that there were expectations that it might enable voters to build up the centre ground in politics. Against a background of party fragmentation the only expected outcome was that the parties would win representation in proportion to their votes and entrench the new divisions.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "3fa55fa7-ff52-4a66-b372-7fdbd3bf15ce", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.575983+00:00"}
{"text": "<Devolution>\n\n\n<$A>\n Why Devolution? \n Paul R. Maguire \n The story of how devolution came to Northern Ireland in 1920 and how it operated during the period 1920-72 has been told many times.  1  It remains relevant and instructive. For our purposes, two essential points from it may be repeated here. First, devolution to Northern Ireland arose out of a historical fluke. Neither unionists nor nationalists in Ireland wanted it; on the contrary, they wanted to avoid it. Unionist concern was to resist 'home rule' for Ireland as a whole and particularly to prevent the province falling within the jurisdiction of a Dublin home-rule parliament. Nationalists wanted home rule for the island but for them any talk of the partition of Ireland and separate institutions in the North was anathema. Wanting to grant home rule to Ireland but being driven by unionist pressure to exclude the North-East of the island from it, the British government legislated for devolution to both North and South, each area with its separate institutions. As Buckland has said of the legislation:  'The Act was basically a device adopted by the British government and Parliament anxious to get rid of the Irish Question and yet obliged to redeem pledges to Ulster unionists'.   2  The proposed institutions only took root in Northern Ireland, Southern Ireland soon becoming a Dominion and later a Republic. \n Second, the operation of devolution in Northern Ireland ended in failure. At the worst of times, the unionist majority in the province governed in its own interest and to the detriment of the minority. At the best of times, the devolved institutions lacked the political consensus across the historical community divide to sustain them. For over fifty years, allegations of discrimination and bias against, and repression of, the minority were widespread, and many of these allegations were justified. When a civil rights movement to redress minority grievances led on to inter-communal violence, this resulted in the deployment of the British Army, in aid of the civil power, in 1969. The slumbering national government was woken up. By 1972 London 's need to control security in the province meant that it had to ask the government of Northern Ireland to agree to powers in this sphere, which legally were vested in the devolved authority, being returned to the centre. When the devolved authority refused to accept this and resigned, the British government, exercising its undoubted legal right, prorogued the Parliament of Northern Ireland and ended devolution. Direct rule of Northern Ireland by Westminster began. Devolution for Northern Ireland at this point looked dead and buried, and few would have thought that after 1972 there would be any sustained interest in it. Expectations pointed away from devolution. Unionists would surely find nothing more acceptable than rule from Westminster? Similarly, one might have expected nationalists to prefer London to Belfast rule: surely the latter would be the last thing they would want? And to the British government, the responsible power internationally accountable for the calamitous situation in Northern Ireland, the idea of entrusting power again to provincial politicians cannot, it might have been thought, have had much appeal. Yet the focus of political debate about the future government of Northern Ireland since then has not substantially centred on forms of government from the centre. Instead, much of the time, it has been directed to the restoration of devolution. Time after time the body has been exhumed and attempts made to breathe life into it. Why? What are the arguments being deployed to support a return to devolution? In this chapter, after considering the demand for devolution, it is proposed to identify and consider these arguments. The purpose is not to pass judgement on the future viability of devolution; rather, it is to seek to explain why it is desired. Understanding the latter may, it is hoped, provide a foundation for conclusions concerning the former. \n  The demand for devolution since 1972  \n The stance of three main groups needs to be considered in the assessment of the demand for devolution: the British government; the Irish government; and the political parties in Northern Ireland. \n As far as the first is concerned, it is clear that a policy of redevolving power to institutions in Northern Ireland has held sway. That this is so is evident from a series of papers published on the future government of Northern Ireland in 1972, 1973, 1974, 1979, 1980 and 1982. 3  Moreover, the Anglo-Irish Agreement signed in 1985 records the British government 's support for devolution in Northern Ireland on a basis which would secure widespread acceptance throughout the community. At the time of writing (mid-1991), the Secretary of State has obtained the agreement of relevant other parties to the establishment of formal talks whose aim,  inter alia  , is to arrive at a situation in which devolved power could again be transferred to regional institutions. \n As regards the Irish government, it is probably correct to say that its approach has varied from time to time. Three periods are worth distinguishing: 1972-9, 1979-85, and 1985 to the present time. In the first of these, Irish governments of all political shades supported a policy which had two limbs to it: first, the establishment of a partnership or power-sharing devolved system in Northern Ireland in which the traditional minority would have a full part to play; and second, the creation of an appropriate institutional recognition of what that that time was referred to as 'the Irish dimension'. Consequent to this broad policy, both Irish government and opposition were in support of the power-sharing and Sunningdale package put together in 1973, with devolved power actually being transferred at the beginning of 1974. When the package came apart in mid-1974, Irish government policy was directed to re-establishing a similar arrangement and this remained the case until the election of Charles Haughey as Fianna F&/ail leader and Taoiseach in 1979. From then until 1985 interest in Northern devolution waned. The emphasis was placed instead on Anglo-Irish intergovernmental structures, a process begun by Haughey and continued by Garret FitzGerald when he was Taoiseach. While this approach faltered because of the Falklands war, and while for a period the field was occupied by the New Ireland Forum which had nothing to say about this idea of devolution to Northern Ireland - its conclusions supporting a series of more or less nationalist options - by 1985 the intergovernmental strategy was back on course, leading in November to the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Though initially rejected by Fianna F&/ail, which were then in opposition, the Agreement has represented Irish Government policy since, despite the return of Fianna F&/ail to power in 1987. In its terms, the Agreement commits the Irish government to support devolution for Northern Ireland, albeit devolution within the context established by the Agreement itself. The strength of that commitment, however, is open to debate. At the time of writing, a gap is proposed in the meetings of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference to enable talks between relevant parties to proceed with the aim mentioned earlier. \n The attitudes of the political parties in Northern Ireland can broadly be seen by reference to manifestos or position papers at times of inter-party negotiation or discussion, that is, in 1972-3, 1975-6, 1980, and 1982-6. Inevitably there have, over time, been some changes in the composition of the 'constitutional' political spectrum  4  but, notwithstanding these, it is possible to distinguish four main groups: the Democratic Unionists (DUP); the Official Unionists (OUP); the Alliance Party; and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). \n The position of the DUP after the breakdown of devolved government in 1972 was that  'Northern Ireland should cease to have any separate legislature or executive of its own, but be fully integrated with the rest of the United Kingdom'.  But by 1975 this position had altered. Since then, either as part of a unionist coalition or in its own right, the DUP has consistently and vigorously argued for devolution. \n In contrast, while the OUP strongly supported redevolution in 1972 and, as part of a unionist coalition, in 1975, after this it became ambivalent, some of the leading spokesmen adhering to a policy of devolution, some advocating only a very weak form of devolution, and others, led by Enoch Powell, calling for integration. Since 1986 OUP support for devolution has been intermittent, though an OUP representative, Jack Allen, appears to have been in favour of it at the Duisburg talks, an informal gathering of representatives from Northern Ireland 's political parties held in Germany in 1989, and, more recently, the party has indicated its willingness to participate in the Secretary of State 's proposed discussions, referred to earlier. \n The Alliance Party has consistently adhered to a policy of redevolution, as is clear from its submissions to the Darlington Conference held in September 1972 (which three out of seven local parties invited by the Secretary of State attended), its participation in the power-sharing executive in 1974, its manifesto for the Convention election in 1975, its participation in the Convention in 1975-6, its submission to the Atkins inter-party talks in 1980, and its involvement in the 1982-6 Assembly. After 1986 it also published its proposals for the future, which centred on devolution. \n Finally, the SDLP position has progressed on lines not dissimilar to those along which the Irish government 's thinking has progressed. While the language used in 1972 was that of the creation of an interim system of government for Northern Ireland in which there would be an Assembly and Executive drawn from it, under the joint responsibility of the British and Irish governments, the party was actively involved in the power-sharing Executive in 1974 and was a supporter of the Sunningdale package. In 1975 its manifesto for the Convention election proposed the establishment of  'a powerful and representative Northern Ireland Assembly'  and an administration in which both sections of the community could participate to the full. It also sought recognition of both Irish and British dimensions. After initial hesitation, the party did take part in the Atkins conference, but only on condition that there be discussions with the Secretary of State to deal with arrangements for an Irish dimension to any agreed partnership form of devolution. In 1982 the SDLP decided to contest the election to the proposed Assembly but not to take any seats, if elected. This was because it considered unworkable the rolling devolution proposal legislated for in the Northern Ireland Act 1982, and, in any event, as far as the party was concerned the plan lacked a sufficient Irish dimension. Instead of going to the Assembly the SDLP became involved in the proceedings of the New Ireland Forum, which sat for the first time on 30 May 1983 and reported on 2 May 1984. As would be expected, the SDLP supported the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Since 1985 there has been interest in the SDLP in devolution within the framework of the Agreement or a suitable Anglo-Irish agreement to supersede it. The SDLP has agreed to enter the formal inter-party talks noted earlier. \n Overall, it may be concluded that the concept of devolution has played a significant part in the thinking of all the groups concerned at some time, if not throughout the period under review. What, of course, has been lacking has been agreement both on the ways in which minority rights are to be safeguarded in the internal operation of devolution and on the relationships between the devolved institutions and the two governments involved. \n  The arguments for devolution  \n In discussing the arguments addressed in favour of devolution, reliance has been placed mainly, but not exclusively, on the stances adopted by the relevant parties: not exclusively, because it is necessary at times to seek to interpret party postures. This is so because very often what parties state is the form of devolution they desire, and only in passing do they state their reasons for preferring a devolutionary model in the first place. Why this is so is itself interesting. The assumption must be that either the parties themselves have not addressed, head-on at any rate, the question why there should be devolution, or they regard candour in this respect, for reasons perhaps related to negotiation, as unnecessary or even counter-productive. Whatever the reason, the result is that in what follows lines of argument may be exposed which are implicit rather than explicit in their thinking.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "cbf795a1-94e9-4fc3-b97b-0966e33cfe76", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.576906+00:00"}
{"text": "<Education principles>\n\n\n<$A>\n Miche&/al Mac Gr&/eil, S.J.  The Social Tasks of Education <*> asterisk </*>  \n Miche&/al Mac Gr&/eil, S.J. lectures in Sociology at St Patrick 's College, Maynooth \n  Introduction - Definition and Functions of Education  \n Like most concepts in wide public use, education means different things to different people. In the context of this paper, I accept that education is:\n  That formal part of the process of socialization through which the culture of the people is transmitted to the young and they (the young) are taught the necessary (technical and social) skills for the pursuit of an occupation and the living of a full adult life in the community   The addition of  'equipping the young to adapt to social change'  might be added by those who would focus on  change. \n It is clear from the above definition that there are three main functions of education, i.e. 1) the personal development of the young person; 2) the provision of necessary occupational skills; 3)socialization in the basic domestic and social skills. \n 1.  Personal Development of the Young Person:  \n This is primarily achieved through the transmission of the convictions, values, norms and symbolic systems of the people 's culture. The young adult needs a broad cultural education to become a critical and rationally self-conscious human being capable of having a spiritual and aesthetic life. Languages and humanities are invaluable in this regard. Of course, the domestic environment of the young person influences the proper disposition for such an education. The value of philosophy, theology, creative arts and literature - classical and modern - could hardly be over-rated for the rich development of a young adult. \n Socialization in what is best of  one 's own culture  is important. Not to be educated in one 's own culture 'deradicalises' young people and cuts them off from their own people, with inevitable problems for their self-worth. We have seen the evidence of damage done to people who have been socialized out of their people 's culture in Ireland, in Africa and elsewhere. \n Unfortunately, in Ireland, we tend to neglect to educate people reared in rural and working-class sub-cultures in their own culture. One of the reasons for the disappointing levels of working-class and the so-called 'lower class' participation in our senior second level and third level programmes may be the cultural alienation which arises from the imposition of exclusively 'middle-class' subcultural ideas, values, norms and symbolic systems in our schools system. \n With the emphasis on materialism and individualism today we are in danger of neglecting the personal and cultural development of the person. A society that neglects this aspect of education may well pay the price in the creation of an intellectually under-developed and socially and politically uncritical population. \n 2.  Transmission of Occupational Skills:  \n This is the second important function of education. Such skills equip the young person to perform a job that is socially useful and personally satisfying. In past times, most of the occupational skills required were handed on informally from one generation to the next. With the advance of literacy and technology and the changes in the range of occupational opportunities, there have been two significant changes or developments, i.e. (a) a shift from manual skills to non-manual and semi-automated and robotic skills; (b) a relatively drastic decline in agricultural-type and manual work and a growth in the demand and sophistication of the 'services sector'. \n Over the past twenty-five years in Ireland, there has been substantial decline in the proportion of people engaged in blue-collar manual skilled and semi-skilled work, and in what were defined as  'routine non-manual workers',  e.g. typists and clerks. (The present audience has witnessed this change close at hand). The automation of formerly labour-intensive work (including skilled work), e.g. the printing trade, and of routine non-manual work, e.g. bank clerks and typing pools, has had serious consequences for the education system. \n The continuing change in the skills required raises the question of early specialization. Retaining will be required within industry as the requisite technological skills change. This has implications for the training in skills within the formal educational system. Many of the skilled occupations today have almost an in-built obsolescence in them. \n There is a second area of occupational skills which modern Irish society requires of its workers, namely the necessary 'organizational skills' required of managers, supervisors and shop stewards. Most serious work in society is performed by groups of workers working in some degree of 'organic' inter-dependence. It is said that over 50 per cent of qualified accountants end up in  managerial roles  in companies and businesses, with workforces made up of diverse skills, trades and professions. The days of exclusively technological curricula are numbered for the main body of students. The choice of occupations and professions should be largely determined by the needs of Irish society and of the students ' local communities in the first instance. Otherwise, Irish society will end up educating and training its young people for stronger and more developed communities. The range of skills transmitted to the young in our less developed areas should equip them to become involved in the development of these areas. \n The Irish educational system has tended to  work against the best interests of our weaker urban and rural communities.  As a result those with greatest talent were syphoned away from their local communities without a commensurate inward migration of talent. This is evident in the West of Ireland. It is true internationally. It would not be unreasonable to discourage  laissez-faire  geographic mobility of talent. This may mean taking a stand against the EU policy of free mobility of labour.  Laissez-faire  geographic mobility is an example of the immediate advantages (in monetary terms) of the individual talented person being diametrically opposed to the social advantages of his or her community of origin. \n In Ireland expensive third level resources are spent on many young people whose productive lives will be spent to the advantage of an already strong society overseas! It is common to learn of whole university classes of highly qualified engineers and scientists being employed abroad. \n 3.  Social and Domestic Skills:  \n The third principal function of education is the transmission of the social and domestic skills required by adults live full lives in the community and participate in the maintenance of a high quality of social life. These include an ability to take part in the political and voluntary organizations which enrich local communities. Serious social problems are due to the lack of involvement of people in a constructive manner in their local communities. This is particularly true of urban societies. \n Social and domestic problems are increasing in Ireland. Coping with unemployment, poor housing planning, substance abuse, family problems, minority discrimination, environmental pollution, and so forth, are major concerns for many citizens. What has our education system done to help prevent or alleviate these problems? Not as much as it should, as far as I can see. \n While it would be unreasonable to expect the educational system to solve these problems, we should, at least, equip our young citizens to cope with them a little better. The social change necessary to solve some of these problems must be, at the end of the day, a political and socio-economic issue or a decision involving radical transfers of resources and structural changes which may impinge on the privileges of the most powerful groups in our society. \n A truly comprehensive education today, therefore, must devote greater attention to the transmission of domestic, social and political skills to those entering young adulthood. Many experienced social workers will say that the lack of domestic organizational skills to cope with family demands frequently leads to marital and family breakdown. I am not saying that the school should replace the home as the place of primary domestic socialization. Rather it must supplement it. \n The role of  adult education  in making up for the deficiency in the transmission of domestic, social and political skills, over recent years, especially through concerned local women 's groups, has been a most welcome development. I would like to see this compensatory role being developed further to include the involvement of more men in the various community programmes. There should be a 'feedback' from adult and community groups into the second and tertiary levels in this area. \n 4.  Education and Social Change:  \n Many sociologists of education see 'social change' as a primary function of education. Some see education as our primary instrument of social change while others would see it as the means of adapting to change. \n The sociologist Talcott Parsons and others view education 's main function as 'pattern maintenance', in other words, the reproduction and continuity of the social system. Can the same institution therefore be expected to serve two apparently contradictory functions in the one society? \n While in a sense both aspects are served, the primary function for education seems to be more continuity than change. This is not to say that when change emerges from sources external to the educational institution, schools and colleges are not used to promote such changes, e.g. when the industrial/commercial and business lobbies want to use the schools systems as ideological and technological agencies to provide producers and consumers deemed necessary for industrial and commercial success. The present emphasis on the production of an 'enterprise culture' could be interpreted as reorientation of education in Ireland away from the broader personal, social and cultural objectives heretofore accepted as constituting the aim and purpose of education. \n  Access to Education  \n 1.  Higher Education  \n Since the introduction of the 'free second-level education' scheme in the late 1960s there has been a significant increase in participation in senior second and third level education in Ireland. In addition to increasing participation, there has been an increase in the variety of schools, colleges and institutes, especially at the third level. The introduction of 'Distance Education' degrees (in Information Technology and in Humanities) in recent years as well as widespread availability of the British 'Open University' should, in time, increase third-level participation. Table 1 shows the impact of 'free education', i.e., those under 35 years of age would have benefited from the 'O'Malley Scheme'. \n\n The figures and predictions published in the Green Paper show the extent of growth in third-level participation. The numbers have increased from 21,000 in 1965 to 70,000 in 1991, i.e. an increase of 333 per cent. In 1991/92 it was estimated that some 40 per cent of the age cohort attended a third-level course, half of whom are pursuing degree programmes. It is further predicted that some 45 per cent of the cohort will be third-level students in the short to medium term. \n The multiplication of third-level colleges is a 'growth industry'. Validation comes generally from three sources, i.e. the N.C.E.A., the traditional universities and an arrangement with some foreign university. If current trends continue, we might see competition for students and also a change in the role of the established Universities. These Universities may become 'fourth-level' institutions. \n A significant development is the growth of post-Leaving 'tertiary tops' and senior colleges, where mature students can re-enter the formal third-level system. It would greatly improve our participation levels and the community relevance of the curriculum if the 'tertiary top' became the national norm. By 'tertiary top' I mean that the first two years of third level studies would be organized locally, i.e. within commuter distance from all students. Every major town would have one and, in co-operation with the county library system, build up an appropriate library for the general demands of the staff and students. The curriculum of the post-Leaving courses should contain a balanced mix of humanities, general science and technology, organizational skills such as industrial relations and social and community studies. \n Access to third level education is a serious issue. Despite the increase in participation in second and third level education, the different social classes do not participate equally in third level education. The very high student fees add to this inequality. Participation in third level, although a financial issue, is also related to curriculum and second level background. With the likely increase of jobs in the community services, the whole area of applied social science and community studies should elicit broader participation. While the more privatized third level institutions deal with the demands of the wealthier sections, the State (with EU funding) will be the main agent of spreading equality of participation. One danger of having the sons and daughters of the rich in one set of institutions is the 'old school tie' informal support network, which would militate against the poor even reaping the occupational advantages of third level participation.  'Separate but equal'  in third-level education may prove to be an illusion.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "1bf11434-b4cf-47d2-b967-8681fcdd6891", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.578010+00:00"}
{"text": "<Marriage and property>\n\n\n<$A>\n<$B>\n<$C>\n FORMS OF PROPERTY TRANSFER \n Arsenberg and Kimball 's and Connell 's accounts do not recognise the possibility of different forms of property transfer within marriage settlements. In our documents, however, we find three forms of property transfer: (a) in fee simple, i.e. with immediate effect; (b) in trust for life (grantor 's life interest) and (c) in trust for life and thereafter to future issue. In fee simple transfer (39 cases), the land and sometimes other named property, e.g. stock, is directly (from the signing) transferred from A to B, subject in most cases to specified conditions for the transferor 's rights of residence. \n In a life trust transfer (64 cases), the transferee obtains an effective interest in the property on or after the transferor 's own or spouse 's death. The transferor has limited his interest in the property to a life estate and while remaining the legal owner, cannot transfer the land to another party. While several forms of language are used to indicate an 'in trust' transfer, the following example is quite typical. On the basis of a marriage between his son Martin and Sarah Cronin,  2  William Coppell agreed to  'assign unto the said Martin Coppell and Sarah Cronin the said holding of land, together with the livestock, farm implements and furniture thereon'  after the deaths of William Coppell and his wife, Winifred. \n Factors such as size of farm or the period when the settlement was executed seems not to have influenced the decision to utilise either a fee simple or a life trust transfer. Fee simple transfers were more likely, however, when the transferor had or was about to reach pension age and or when the property was being handed over to a son as sole owner. Considerable differences were also evident in the treatment of in-marrying men and women. Thirty of the incomers were men and while they represented a failure to keep the name on the land, the marriage settlements guaranteed their legal rights to the property. By contrast we find no reference to property rights for more than half of the in-marrying females. \n In the third form of transfer, property is passed on in trust for life but there is also a reference to a third generation. This form comes closest to the strict marriage settlement. For both the landed gentry and West of Ireland farmers the objective is to keep land in the family. The gentry 's problem was to protect the property from dissolute sons. Widow 's relatives were the most often perceived threat to the farmer 's property. In 9 of the 113 marriage settlements reference is made to the future issue of the marriage. Thus, on the 12 December 1917 Thomas Casey, in consideration of his approaching marriage to Margaret Wilkenson and of her fortune of <*> pound sign </*> 140 (<*> pound sign </*> 80 had been paid and the balance was to be secured by a promissory note from the future father-in-law payable in twelve months), transferred his lands to her in fee simple, to the use of himself during his lifetime; to her if she should survive him and, following both their deaths, to the eldest child of the marriage. In the event of there being no children, the lands were to pass after Margaret 's death to Thomas Casey 's heirs. In somewhat similar fashion, Thomas Kearney made a settlement on his son, John, his future daughter-in-law Julia Crawford and their issue. Terms similar to the Casey settlement are present, but a further clause was added to the effect that should Julia survive her husband and leave  'no lawful issue',  the lands should remain her property  'until she shall receive the sum of three hundred pounds plus the sum of twenty pounds for each year of her marriage... But upon tender to her of the said sums of money, she shall be obliged to leave the said house and to deliver up quiet and peaceable possession of the said lands'.  \n WHO TRANSFERRED TO WHOM \n Only 36 marriage settlements involve a property transfer which fits the ideal model, that is, father to son. For example, a marriage settlement in March 1916 relating to the marriage of Walter Cullen and Kate O'Brien stipulated that    Kate 's father pay Walter 's father <*> pound sign </*> 120 and that the latter 's father transfer his lands to Walter. Walter, in turn, agreed to support, maintain and clothe his mother Celia and his brother  'in a manner suitable to their station in life'.  All the stock on the farm was to become Walter 's property on his father 's death, with the exception of one heifer and one bullock which were to be given to his brother (for his own use) provided he had not already received them during his father 's lifetime. \n The second largest category of property transfer (13 cases) was between mothers and their sons. As in the following instance, the mothers were almost invariably widows. Mary Markey, widow and farmer, agreed, on the grounds of a forthcoming marriage between her son James and Mary Cryan, to grant and assign to James her lands, containing 62 acres, from and after her death, and also all stock, crops, farm implements and furniture that may be on the lands at that time. She and James also covenanted with Margaret Markey, daughter and sister, to maintain her in the house in a fit and proper manner until she got married or chose to leave the house, and also to pay her <*> pound sign </*> 60 and give her a calf and the grazing of the calf on the lands free of charge as long as she remained in the house. The fact that a further 51 transfers all involve a kinship connection such as aunt to niece, uncle to nephew, brother to sister etc. bears witness to the preoccupation with keeping land in the family. \n Yet, along with family sentiment, there was an equal concern with having property established on a firm legal footing. This is evidenced by instances where intending spouses were the direct and sole parties to property transfers. Settlements between husband and wife-to-be account for 8 and between wife and husband-to-be for 5 of the property transfers. In an example of the former, a husband-to-be agreed to transfer his lands, farming stock and goods to his intended wife  'as and from the day of his death'.  In an example of the latter, a marriage settlement between Delia Hanamy, widow and farmer, and Thomas Feeney, farmer and dealer stipulated that she grant her lands to him while he grant her <*> pound sign </*> 200. All of the female to male transfers are in fee simple; all of the male to female transfers are either life trusts or 'strict settlements'. \n RIGHTS OF TRANSFERORS AND TRANSFEREES \n Marriage settlements are concerned not only with the transfer of property but also with the future status of the parties to the transaction. In 35 of the marriage settlements reference is made to the future rights (other than those dealing with land) of those who were ceding their property. A standard reservation was for the right to continue to reside in the house and to be entitled to the exclusive use of the room which they occupied. Several other conditions could be added, however. Thus Mary Croke, a widow, reserved not only the right to reside in the family dwelling house and  'to be suitably maintained and clothed on and out of the lands, in a manner suitable to her station in life',  but also the rights of her son and daughters to reside in the house during holidays. Mary Cooney, a widow was not only to be supported, maintained and clothed, retaining exclusive use of a bedroom in the house, but also in the event of a dispute taking place between herself and her son whereby she was compelled to leave the house, then her son was to pay her ten shillings per week. All settlements where the transferor 's residential and other domestic rights are listed are in fee simple form. \n In 28 marriage settlements reference is made to the rights of those to whom the property was being transferred. Existing accounts of the match make no reference to such rights. For example, as part of a marriage settlement, William Quinney undertook to clothe and maintain his son and daughter-in-law to whom he had signed over his holding of twenty six acres on the basis that they undertook to live with him, to work the holding  'in a proper manner'  and that his daughter-in-law 's father would pay him the sum of <*> pound sign </*> 30. In similar manner, Thomas Small made a covenant to  'clothe, support and permit to live in the house on the lands he was assigning, his daughter and future son-in-law'.  He and his wife also agreed to assist the new couple  'in the working and management of the lands'  and to put into the settlement any further lands they might acquire subsequent to its signing. In these and similar cases the transferor had retained a life interest in and a level of control over the property. Typically, as in the Small case, some form of joint management arrangement was envisaged. \n DOWRY PAYMENTS \n The dowry has been considered an integral element of peasant marriage. However, in only 68 of 113 marriage settlements is there reference to a dowry payment (usually referred to as a marriage fortune or portion) and in only ten of the 68 cases is the dowry paid by the bride 's father to the groom 's father. Thus Michael O'Sullivan, registered owner of thirty-four acres, in consideration of the marriage of his son John to Mary Gray and the sum of <*> pound sign </*> 50 having been paid to him by her father, on the 18th of April 1916 transferred his lands to himself  'for and during his natural life'  and after his death to John. The bride 's mother paid the dowry to the groom 's mother in four settlements and to the groom 's father in one. In a further seven cases the groom himself paid the dowry to his future bride 's father. An example of this type of dowry payment is found in the marriage settlement where Edward Hastings, in view of the forthcoming marriage of his daughter Mary to James Looney, agreed to transfer his lands (40 acres) and assign his household furniture  'from the date of his death to the said James Looney',  on condition that the latter pay him the sum of <*> pound sign </*> 100. James Looney was further charged with the payment of <*> pound sign </*> 30 per annum to Edward Hastings. In six cases the bride-to-be paid the dowry to her future husband 's father. The bride-to-be 's brother paid the dowry on nine occasions: four times to the groom 's mother, twice to the groom 's father, twice directly to the groom and in one case the bride and her brother paid the groom and his uncle. \n Interestingly, five cases involve direct dowry payment between bride and groom. In three of these the groom paid the dowry to his future wife and in two others the order was reversed. One of the largest recorded dowries was paid by a brother and sister to the sister 's future husband and his uncle: on the 9th May 1930, John Harney senior agreed to transfer his lands, 265 acres, dwelling house and outhouses to his nephew, John Harney junior (who had been living with him for several years) and his wife-to-be, Mary Ellen Sherry, providing she paid a marriage portion of <*> pound sign </*> 1,000, <*> pound sign </*> 650 of which was to be paid to John Harney Junior and <*> pound sign </*> 350 to John Harney Senior. The settlement goes on to indicate that John Harney Senior would transfer all his stock (100 sheep, 70 lambs, 14 two-year-old cattle, 3 calves, 3 cows and 1 horse), the furniture in the dwelling house and the farm implements to his nephew and that Mary Ellen Sherry and her brother John covenanted with John Harney Junior to pay the balance of the marriage portion - <*> pound sign </*> 200 - within 12 months of signing the settlement.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ce155803-de7a-4d8a-9130-1882c53d950c", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.579390+00:00"}
{"text": "<UCC entrants>\n\n\n<$A>\n  Inequalities in Preparation for University Entrance: An Examination of the Educational Histories of Entrants to University College, Cork  \n INTRODUCTION \n University students are a highly selected population in that of all those who seek university places in any given year only a proportion succeed. While the selection process is 'objective' in that places are allocated on the basis of examination results, studies of third level entrants have indicated that students from the higher socio-economic groups are over-represented within the higher status (and higher points) faculties (Clancy 1982, 1988). \n Most students obtain their places on the basis of achievement in the Leaving Certificate examination. Some achieve entry on the results of the Matriculation Examination of the National University of Ireland (NUI). Indeed, many students seeking places in NUI colleges sit both examinations as the two sets of results may be combined to calculate points in the allocation of places in these colleges. One can thus 'improve' one 's chance of a university place in the NUI by sitting both examinations. \n Students usually sit for the Leaving Certificate and/or the Matriculation at the end of a five year post-primary programme. There are, however, schools which take six years to complete the course. Schools offering the longer course tend to be the more prestigious academic secondary schools, many of them fee-paying. There are undoubted advantages to a six year programme. Students are usually older and more mature when sitting the Leaving Certificate. The extra year also permits students to develop academic and other skills of lasting value. Students taking six year programmes sit the same examinations and compete for the same university places with those from five year schools. This must give them at least some advantage in the competition for university places. \n In recent years some schools have been given the option of offering an extra 'transition' year to pupils between the end of the junior and the beginning of the senior cycles. This extra year will undoubtedly perform the function of permitting the maturation of students prior to taking the Leaving Certificate. In addition, transition programmes provide all students, those seeking third level entrance and those intending to complete formal education at the end of the senior cycle, with skills and knowledge of a wider and more practical type than would be attained within the traditional curriculum. However, not all schools have sought, or been given, this option. Further, when available within any given school, the transition year may be optional, or may be available to selected pupils only, for example, those who are adjudged too young to proceed to senior cycle, or those who are perceived by the school authorities as being capable of benefitting from it, however this may be judged. \n Students failing to obtain a university place, or their preferred place, may re-sit for one or both examinations, on one or more occasions. There are indications that this practice is becoming more popular. In some third level institutions, including universities (though excluding University College Dublin and University College Cork), students are permitted to combine the results of more than one sitting of these examinations for purposes of scoring 'points ', though this practice is to be discontinued as and from 1992. However, students will continue to have a second or further chance to compete for a third level place without penalty apart from an extra year in school and the payment of the appropriate fees. \n It might be argued, then, that students competing for university and other third level places to not do so on an equal footing. Some students have prepared for five years, others for six, even seven, as some who repeat the examinations do so following a six year school programme. Students who re-sit on one or more occasions might also be considered to have benefitted from examination practice.\n The vast majority of Irish children receive their education within 'recognised' post-primary schools. All these schools, including those charging fees, receive government funding, the amount and type being dependent on the type of school. Nonetheless, students at fee-paying schools are charged significantly less than the economic cost of their education as are students who elect to repeat the Leaving Certificate within 'recognised' schools. Thus, much of the extra preparation for third level entrance is paid for from public funds, although it is individuals who benefit. \n Students preparing for examinations leading to third level entrance may also seek extra help in one or more subjects. Occasionally, this may be obtained at home, from family or friends, or schools may offer some students additional classes. More commonly, however, such help is obtained outside the family and school from individuals or groups who offer specific examination coaching in one or more subjects. In recent years there appears to be an increase in the number of individuals and tutorial colleges offering specialised individual or small class tuition. The colleges may also run short intensive revision courses in the school holidays, and some also provide a full-time Leaving Certificate course, aimed mostly at students repeating for better results. \n None of these groups or individuals receives any state support. They operate as business enterprises, charging relatively high fees on an hourly or yearly basis. We do not know how many students use these facilities, and for what subjects. Nor do we know who uses them, or whether they give students an advantage when competing for scarce third level places. That their numbers appear to be growing and that they are paid for out of individuals ' pockets seems to indicate that at least some people believe that extra tuition is valuable. As a relatively expensive 'optional extra' it is likely that the students who use such facilities are from the more advantaged social backgrounds. They may also be lower ability students, though this is not necessarily the case and we have no evidence to support it. \n How do students select from among the various educational options outlined above? Are different patterns evident among students from different social backgrounds? These are the concerns of this study. \n METHODOLOGY \n The study is a pilot study of an exploratory nature. It was limited to Irish students who entered UCC in 1989 and who had competed for their university places through the Central Admissions Office (CAO), that is, those who were awarded university degree places on the basis of 'points '. We thus excluded all foreign students and mature students who are awarded places on a quota basis. Information was collected from students in the classroom using an administered questionnaire. We attempted complete coverage of the population to simplify data collection. \n In faculties where first year students follow common courses, the problems of locating students were few. The faculties of Arts and Science posed particular problems. Science students should have proved less difficult to contact than students in Arts as all science students are required to take on or two courses in Mathematics. Coverage of these two classes ought to have given us access to all first science students. As Arts students are not required to take any common subject, we selected two large classes that are timetabled back to back in first year, Sociology and French. Almost 80 per cent of all first Arts students were registered for one or other of these courses and on further investigation we discovered that a high proportion of the remaining students were registered in Applied Psychology. Coverage of these three classes should have provided us with access to over 90 per cent of all first Arts students. \n Non-attendance at class proved the greatest obstacle to complete coverage and we were less successful than we had hoped in obtaining information from all the students. The Arts and Science faculties were the most problematic with non-attendance of up to 25 per cent in at least one of the classes we visited. In addition to non-attendance there were some students who refused to complete the questionnaire. The number here were small, however, and it was non-attendance rather than refusals which account for the difference between the numbers we obtained and the numbers in the targeted population. Complete coverage was obtained in Social Science, and almost complete coverage in Commerce (97 per cent). The coverage in the other faculties was: Electrical Engineering 88 per cent, Medicine 87 per cent, Law 82 per cent, Dentistry 81 per cent, Civil Engineering 80 per cent, Arts 66 per cent and Science 63 per cent. In all we obtained information from 77 per cent of the targeted population, which is three hundred and sixteen students short of complete coverage. We feel the coverage is adequate for a pilot study. \n THE RESULTS \n Information was collected from 1058 students, all of whom entered UCC in 1989 and had competed for their places through the CAO. Only students who had received their second level education within Ireland were included. Over 70 per cent of the students were from Cork city or county; 21 per cent were from the rest of Munster, 6 per cent were from Leinster and the remainder came from Connaught and Ulster, including the six counties of Northern Ireland. They ranged in age from seventeen to twenty-one. The mean age was eighteen. More than half the students were women (59.6 per cent). \n The students came from all social classes (see Table 1), but as in previous studies of university entrants the higher social classes were over represented (Clancy, 1982, 1988). Seventy-five per cent of our respondents came from families where the chief earner was in a non-manual job, or was a farmer with over 50 acres. Twenty-eight per cent of students were in receipt of higher education grants and 1.6 per cent held scholarships. \n\n Most students, then, depended on their parents to provide the finance for their education, though a small number of students supported themselves wholly or in part. Over sixty percent were from families where neither parent had received third level education. \n Previous studies of third level entrants found that students from secondary schools were more likely to enter universities than those who had been educated at community, comprehensive or vocational schools. Our population displayed the same pattern. Eighty-five percent of our respondents had attended secondary schools, 12 per cent had been to community or comprehensive schools, and a mere 3 per cent had been to vocational schools. Almost 25 per cent of all students had attended fee paying secondary schools. We did not calculate the transfer rate for each type of school but we found that 23.6 per cent of all first year entrants to UCC in 1989 had attended one of three fee paying schools in Cork city. We estimate that between them these three schools cater for just under 10 per cent of the post-primary pupils in the city. Further, an examination of the schools attended by students from Cork city indicate that students from non-fee paying schools in predominantly middle class areas of the city are over represented in our population. \n We asked students to indicate the length of secondary programme they had followed, the number of times they had attempted Leaving Certificate and/or Matriculation, whether they had repeated any year during their post-primary education, the amount and type of extra tuition they had received (if any), and the subjects in which it was obtained. They were also asked to indicate the cost of any coaching they had received. With this information, we were able to identify the ways in which students prepared to compete for university places. \n  Length of post-primary school programme  \n Seventy-three percent of the students had attended schools which offered a five year post-primary programme. One in five of these students, however, had spent six years at post-primary level prior to university entrance. Students in five year programmes extended their stay in school in one of two ways: (1) they repeated the Leaving Certificate (68 per cent) or (2) they opted to repeat a year earlier in the post-primary programme. Students who took this latter option usually repeated 5th year, though there was a small number, seven in all, who had retaken the first year in post-primary school. \n Two hundred and seventy-seven, or 26.2 per cent of the total population, had followed a six year post-primary programme. Here, too, there were students who had extended their post-primary education by at least one year. The number doing so was small (33) but it amounts to 12 per cent of all students from six year programmes. As with those in five year schools two methods of extending the programme were employed. Two thirds of these 'seven year' students spent the extra year repeating the Leaving Certificate, the others, with one exception, repeated 5th year. \n In all, 421 students spent six or more years at post-primary level. This is 40 per cent of all first year entrants to UCC in 1989.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "15ae1761-76c6-466c-b75d-e21ae430a65d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.580462+00:00"}
{"text": "<Part-time working>\n\n\n<$A>\n  PART-TIME WORKING IN IRELAND IN A EUROPEAN CONTEXT  \n EILEEN P. DREW \n Department of Statistics, Trinity College, Dublin \n  (Read before the Society, 25 October 1990) \n 1. INTRODUCTION \n The subject of part-time work is one which has become increasingly important in industrialized economies, most notably Norway, Sweden, United States, Canada, Denmark and the United Kingdom, where it accounts for a substantial and growing proportion of total employment. It has been noted that resort to part-time workers was generally a response to a shortage of available labour, particularly when it coincided with periods of economic boom. However the view that part-timers would be engaged at times of economic upturn and be among the first categories of workers to be let go at periods of recession has not been upheld during the last decade. It is now recognised that part-time working is no temporary practice. Rather it represents a growth segment of an otherwise static to falling labour force in many developed economies. \n The selection of Ireland as the location for study is particularly relevant since unlike some other EC countries where part-time working is extensive and well-established, Ireland has been slow to adjust to this pattern of work, despite high levels of unemployment. In most countries where part-time working is common it is associated with women workers. This association in the minds of employers and trade unionists may be important in formulating attitudes towards part-time working which could have affected the prospects of Irish women in obtaining part-time opportunities and a place in the labour force. \n Some recent labour market theorists have related part-time working to the preoccupation of many employers with their search to reduce labour and other costs. Increasingly it is argued that 'flexibility' is required to meet market needs. The 'flexibility' model extends to a number of growing labour practices including 'Numerical Flexibility' (which includes the use of part-time labour as one of a number of means of meeting changes in levels of output) (Institute of Manpower Studies, 1986). \n Associated with these developments there has been a significant change in the relative importance of service industries compared with the diminishing share of employment in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors in most develop economies. Service sector employment accounts for a large and growing proportion of the labour force and is expected to continue to grow in coming decades especially in the information-related industries which include professional and financial services. Indeed the size and rate of growth of services has come to be a hallmark of developed economies. By its very nature, the service sector does not lend itself comfortably to a manufacturing type production schedule based on one or more 8 hour shifts. Consumer-based services are increasingly demanded by the public on an extended hours basis, which has been the trend in the United States and Western Europe in retailing, banking and fast-food catering. There are no indications that this trend will be reversed and it seems more likely that the existing trend will continue. Where extended services are made available there are inevitable scheduling problems which make it more attractive for employers to engage part-time staff. \n Part-time work represents an already well established alternative to full-time working and a possible future 'model' of working which appeals to certain categories of workers and aspiring re-entrants to the labour market. This paper explores the phenomenon of part-time working in Ireland, relative to its development in other European Community countries. \n Having evaluated variations in the relative importance of part-time employment within the Community, unpublished Irish data are analysed to arrive at hypotheses concerning current patterns and the apparent reluctance of Irish employers to employ part-time labour. \n Part-time is defined as  \"voluntary work, performed on a regular basis, in respect of which an employer and employee agree to shorter working hours than normal hours of work\".  This definition, which is used by the Commission of the European Communities, emphasizes the voluntary and regular nature of part-time work; the fact that it is performed in a formal employment context and that there are no restrictions on the house or patterns of hours worked. \n  2. ANALYSIS OF PART-TIME WORKING IN THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY  \n This analysis is confined to the countries (9) which have been members of the European Community (EC) since 1975 or earlier. Although the information which is published by Eurostat on part-time employment, obtained from national Labour Force Sample surveys, is limited compared with census data from some countries, it has the main advantage of being standardized, in terms of definition (e.g. of activity rates and (un)employment), timing (in a reference week between March and May) and survey procedures, throughout member states. This allows more reliable cross-country comparisons to be made than if individual country based data were used. The Labour Force Survey is also a particularly useful source of national data on countries, such as Ireland, which do not collect such data in the national Census of Population. \n  2.1 Location of Part-time Workers in the EC  \n In 1987, there were over 15 million part-time workers in the 9 member states (excluding Greece, Spain and Portugal), compared with almost 11 million in 1975. The greatest concentrations of part-time workers were in the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Italy. Together, these countries accounted to 82 per cent of part-time workers in the European Community in 1987. All countries experienced increases in the overall level of part-time working between 1975 and 1987. In Ireland there was an increase of 11 per cent in part-time working, followed by Belgium, France, Denmark and the UK (Table 1). For women, the level of part-time employment increased in every member state. Allied to the rising level of female participation in the European Community, the increase in part-time working represents a shift in the standard pattern of working. \n Figure 1 shows the relationship between part-time and full-time employment in each of the member states. In terms of relative importance to the labour force, the Netherlands, Denmark and the United Kingdom were the countries in which part-timers accounted for at least one-fifth of all workers in 1987. Even though there were considerable numbers of part-time workers in France, Germany and Italy, they formed less than 13 per cent of persons with an occupation in those countries. In 1987 the countries in which part-time working was less common were: Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg and Belgium. On average, part-time workers accounted for 14 per cent of all workers in the European Community in that year, compared with 11 per cent of workers in 1975. \n  2.2 Women and Part-time Employment in the EC  \n The increase in female labour force participation throughout the European Community has meant that women are slowly but perceptibly comprising a larger segment of the labour force. Whereas in 1975 women accounted for 35 per cent of all workers, by 1987 this had risen to 39 per cent. The OECD has stated that the importance of the rise in the number and percentage of women workers  \"could be overestimated if the considerable part-time element of female labour force participation were ignored\"  (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 1983). \n The likelihood that women workers will be employed on a part-time rather than a full-time basis varies widely between different member states. By 1987, 45 per cent of women workers in the United Kingdom worked part-time and in Denmark the figure was 42 per cent. In Germany, 30 per cent of women worked part-time and more than one-fifth of French and Belgian women worked other than full-time schedules. Italy and Ireland had the lowest proportion of women workers engaged in part-time employment (Eurostat, 1989). \n If the data for married women workers are examined, the pattern across different countries emerges as more consistent and the importance of part-time working for married women becomes quite stark. With the exception of Italy, at    least   one quarter of married women workers were engaged part-time in 1987 (Eurostat, 1989). In Denmark and the United Kingdom half of employed married women were working part-time. In Ireland the level was 26 per cent, a similar level to that in France, Belgium and Luxembourg. \n  2.3 Part-time Working Across Industrial Sectors in the EC  \n Sectoral data, available since 1983, indicate clearly that part-time working is closely associated with the service sector. However, Italy and Ireland contrast strongly with the other member states. Whereas all other countries had at least 70 per cent of part-time workers in the service sector in 1983, the comparable figures for Italy and Ireland were 46 per cent and 63 per cent respectively. Not only does part-time working account for a much smaller portion of total employment in these two countries, but where part-timers do exist, they are more likely to be spread over the three industrial sectors. Thirty-five per cent of Italian part-time workers were engaged in agriculture in 1983, and the comparable figure for Ireland was 24 per cent of part-time workers. Outside of Italy and Ireland the range of part-time workers engaged in agriculture was from 2 per cent in the United Kingdom to a maximum of 14 per cent in France (Table 2). \n In 1983, part-time workers in manufacturing were more common in Germany, Italy and, to a lesser extent, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark. By 1987, some countries registered an increase in part-time manufacturing jobs most notably the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and Denmark. Ireland and Germany experienced a decrease in part-time manufacturing employment (Table 2). \n All countries experienced a further concentration of part-time working in the service sector. Within the Community the level rose    from   76 to 79 per cent between 1983 and 1987. In Ireland there was a notable increase from 63 per cent in 1983 to 74 per cent in 1987. In Italy the shift towards more part-time working in services was less pronounced. These data indicate that countries like the United Kingdom and Denmark which have a high concentration of jobs in services generally, also tend to have the greatest number of part-time service jobs. Germany has a more highly developed manufacturing sector which continues to employ a higher than average percentage of the labour force, 40 per cent in 1987 compared with an EC (9) average of 34 per cent. Therefore it would be expected that relatively fewer part-time service jobs would be created in Germany. Italy and Ireland have a less well developed service sector employing less than the EC (9) average of 60 per cent. They also employ a larger proportion of the labour force in agriculture than other member states (Eurostat, 1989). \n Part-time women workers are more heavily concentrated in the service sector than their male counterparts. In 1987 the service sector accounted for 79 per cent of all part-timers and 82 per cent of female part-time workers in the Community (9). In all countries, women were less likely than men to work part-time in agriculture and manufacturing and hence were more likely to be engaged in the service sector (Eurostat, 1989). \n Certain conclusions can be drawn from the foregoing analysis of part-time working. First, it tends to be associated with women workers and higher levels of female participation in the labour force. Where men work part-time it is more likely that they are engaged in agriculture and manufacturing than in the case for women. The link between part-time working and women 's participation is even stronger for married than single women workers. Clearly the part-time option, where available, is predominantly sought by married women to enable them to participate in the labour force whilst having and rearing their children. \n A second major conclusion is that there is no overall predominant pattern to explain part-time working across the member states. All of the data point to considerable differences, often between neighbouring countries. High levels of part-time working occur in the Netherlands, Denmark and United Kingdom. Part-time working is lowest in Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg and Belgium. \n The third major conclusion is that part-time working occurs mainly the in the service sector. It is only in Italy and Ireland that it supports a significant number of workers in the agricultural sector. Overall the trend is towards increased concentration of part-time working in the service industries.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "aa76d8e2-4459-4139-a7ad-2981752f38a9", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.581486+00:00"}
{"text": "<Abortion referendum>\n\n\n<$A>\n<$B>\n THE MAASTRICHT PROTOCOL \n The first question that the government chose to address was whether to amend Protocol 17 of the Maastricht Treaty on European Union. This protocol stated that  \"nothing in the Treaty on European Union\u00c9.shall affect the application in Ireland of Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution of Ireland\".   3  The protocol was originally intended to ensure that the anti-abortion article in the Irish constitution would be copper-fastened against any rulings based on European Community law. In the light of the \"X\" case, both pro-choice and anti-abortion groups adopted positions on the Maastricht Protocol. The pro-choice groups argued that the protocol had to be removed as it allocated women a secondary role in Irish society \u00d0 removing from them the right of appeal to Community law in relation to maters of abortion. The anti-abortion groups demanded that a referendum to overturn the Supreme Court decision be held  before  any referendum on the Maastricht Treaty on the grounds that the Maastricht Protocol would copper-fasten Article 40.3.3 which the Supreme Court had interpreted as permitting abortion. \n The government first tried to have the protocol amended or deleted. This attempt was thwarted by other EC governments, because of fears that any reopening of the treaty could lead to demands for changes from other governments of the other EC member states a  \"Solemn Declaration\",  which stated that the signatories to the Maastricht Treaty had never intended Protocol 17 to be used to interfere with the freedom to travel or to obtain information and that they would be favourably disposed to amending it if Article 40.3.3 itself was amended. There was widespread confusion and debate in Ireland about the legal standing and implications of the Protocol and the Solemn Declaration. \n Having secured the Solemn declaration, the government announced that the Maastricht referendum would be held on 18 June. The leaders of the four main parties issued a joint statement pledging that referendums to secure the rights to travel and information would be held later in the year. The government also established a special sub-committee charged with developing a strategy on the abortion issue, to decide, in particular, whether a legislative response alone was sufficient or whether a referendum would also be required. This committee consisted of four ministers (including Des O'Malley of the Progressive Democrats) and the Attorney General. The government announced that it would respond to the Supreme Court decision later in the year following recommendations from the sub-committee. \n The government 's refusal to reveal whether it would introduce a referendum to overturn the Supreme Court decision or introduce legislation to implement it, and its failure to secure the amendment or deletion of Protocol 17, led both the anti-abortion and pro-choice groups to oppose the Maastricht referendum. The anti-abortion groups were supported by two prominent Fianna F&/ail senators \u00d0 Des Hanafin, a founding member of the Pro-Life Campaign, and Eamon &/O Cu&/iv who challenged the government plan and sought a deferral of Maastricht until the abortion issue was resolved. While both claimed they had considerable support from senior party members, the attempt to secure a deferral failed and the internal divisions within Fianna F&/ail on the issue were effectively contained. \n The government was supported by the main opposition parties in calling for a \"yes\" vote and tried to focus the campaign on the economic issues of the Maastricht Treaty. The Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, spent considerable energy in attempting to separate abortion from the Maastricht Treaty \u00d0 attempts which were continuously scuttled by the media and the public. Opinion polls before the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty indicated that concerns about rights to travel and information on one hand, and concern about abortion on the other, were regarded as important issues by large numbers of the electorate. Despite this, the Maastricht Treaty was comfortably passed, by 69 per cent to 31 per cent. The fact that the anti-abortion groups had conducted an intensive nationwide campaign against Maastricht (in many parts of the country they were the only groups canvassing against the Maastricht Treaty) meant that its heavy defeat was interpreted as being a significant defeat for the anti-abortion groups. \n THE FORMULATION OF THE REFERENDUMS \n In the aftermath of Maastricht, pro-choice and anti-abortion groups sought positive action from the government on the abortion question. But by refusing to reveal his intentions, the Taoiseach rendered all campaigning void and the debate effectively ceased during the summer months. The silence was undoubtedly designed to minimise the impact of the issue on the public domain. One Fianna F&/ail spokesperson commented that the policy was one of depriving the anti-abortion campaigners of political bones to chew on while the Oireachtas was in recess. \n In September the government turned its attention to the abortion question. As the D&/ail reconvened, there was a palpable restlessness among extra-parliamentary campaigners as to when the abortion question would be confronted. The Taoiseach maintained, however, that the sub-committee had not yet made its recommendations. It was soon clear that there were divisions between the coalition parties. While both Fianna F&/ail and the Progressive Democrats supported referendums on the rights to travel and information, they differed over how to deal with the issue of abortion. The Progressive Democrats favoured legislation that would implement the Supreme Court decision in the \"X\" case while Fianna F&/ail favoured a referendum that would specifically rule out suicide as a basis for obtaining an abortion in Ireland. On 7 October, the details of the government 's proposals were published. In spite of objections from the Progressive Democrats, the government was proposing that three referendums be held on 3 December. These referendums put forward the following additions to Article 40.3.3, which read:\n The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due respect to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.  \n The three proposed amendments were as follows: 1) Abortion Issue:  \"It shall be unlawful to terminate the life of an unborn unless such termination is necessary to save the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother, where there is an illness or disorder of the mother giving rise to a real or substantive risk to her life, not being a risk of self-destruction\".  \n 2) Travel:  \"Subsection 3  o  of this section shall not limit freedom to travel between the State and another state\". \n 3) Information:  \"Subsection 3  o  of this section shall not limit freedom to obtain or make available, in the State, subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law, information relating to services lawfully available in another state\".  \n The publication of the proposed workings was followed by negotiations between the Taoiseach and other party leaders. Opposition from the progressive Democrats and from within Fianna F&/il itself forced the Taoiseach to concede that a re-formulation of the wording would at least be considered. Interestingly, given the conceptualisation of Fianna F&/ail as representing traditional Catholic values, some of the internal opposition (from backbenchers) articulated what might be considered a feminist consciousness on the issue; that it was insulting and degrading to women to make a distinction between their \"life\" and their \"health\". It was clear, however, that Fianna F&/ail was determined to offer a referendum that would rule out suicide as a basis for obtaining an abortion. Within the D&/ail, the immediate response was somewhat muted. Fine Gael, Labour, the Democratic Left and, indeed, the Progressive Democrats all requested time to consider. There were three contentious issues; first, the distinction made between a woman 's health and a woman 's life; second, the question of whether, as in the \"X\" case, a threat of suicide ought to be viewed as an appropriate circumstance in which abortion could be provided; and, third, whether the proposed wording did in fact return the law to the pre-\"X\" case situation. \n The reaction from the anti-abortion and pro-choice groups to the wording on the abortion issue was predictable. The pro-choice groups opposed any move to overturn the Supreme Court judgement in the \"X\" case that in certain circumstances a woman did have a right to an abortion. They also opposed the distinction drawn between a woman 's health and life. While the pro-choice groups welcomed the proposals on travel and information, they declared that these rights were so basic that they would not actively campaign on these issues. The anti-abortion groups opposed the government 's working on the abortion issue because, they argued, it did not rule out all  \"direct abortions\".  It was clear that unless the anti-abortion groups were satisfied that a particular wording completely overturned the Supreme Court judgement, they would campaign against it. The Taoiseach issued a warning on 9 October that legislation based on the \"X\" case hearing would be introduced if the referendum on the abortion issue was defeated. This veiled threat was aimed at the anti-abortion forces \u00d0 such legislation would clearly include a suicide threat as grounds for a legal abortion, and therefore would constitute, in their eyes, a more liberal set of abortion laws. In effect, he argued, the choice was between two necessary evils \u00d0 one less evil than the other. The anti-abortion groups were opposed to the information referendum and were divided on the travel issue. \n The opposition within the D&/ail was at least united in its call for a legislative response coupled with clarification of the words used in the proposed referendum bills. During the weekend following the release of the wording, the Taoiseach agreed to extend the time available for consultations with opposition leaders. The comparatively slow response from the other parties, in spite of the prolonged incubation period that preceded it, seemed to indicate some difficulty on the part of the opposition in coming to a firm position. By early the following week, however, the party machines had ground out some tangible points of opposition. Formal submissions were made separately by the leaders of Fine Gael, Labour and the Democratic Left. All sought, at minimum, the advance publication of legislation that would precisely identify circumstances in which abortions could be performed and would provide a protective framework for the medical profession. Fine Gael 's submission demanded a postponement of the referendums until such a legislative framework was provided. \n The Taoiseach indicated that amendments could be considered, and some kind of consensus still appeared possible. However, early exchanges in the D&/ail on 9 October indicated that if any consensus was to be arrived at, this would involve enormous compromises on all sides. During the debate, the Taoiseach criticised the opposition parties for deliberately trying to spread confusion on the issue, and the Democratic Left in particular for advocating a policy of abortion on demand. When the debate arose again in the D&/ail during the order of business on 13 October, the Fine Gael leader, John Bruton, and others expressed anger that full information had not been submitted in the briefing document supplied to the opposition by Fianna F&/ail. Bruton was particularly concerned over the contradiction between the Taoiseach 's assessment and that of the Attorney General on the status of referendums. According to newspaper reports the latter had suggested that regardless of the outcome of the referendum on the abortion issue, separate legislation would be required. The Taoiseach denied this. Following repeated questioning from the opposite benches, the Taoiseach finally conceded that if the three referendum proposals were passed it would be  \"the end of the matter\".  4  The parliamentary rhetoric did not indicate the easing of a path to some kind of collective agreement, and by the time the deadline for discussions had been reached a consensus approach was no longer on the cards. \n This friction was exacerbated by Reynolds 's categorical announcement following a cabinet meeting on 15 October that no amendments would be accepted and no changes would be made in the wording. This ensured that all of the opposition parties, as well as the Progressive Democrats, were opposed to some aspect or other of the government 's proposals. However, the Progressive Democrats, fearful of causing a general election that would be dominated by the abortion issues, decided to support the government 's proposals in the D&/ail. Des O'Malley indicated, however, that his party would not be actively campaigning with the government. The pragmatic resolution of the dilemma was exemplified by the contributions to the D&/ail debate from Mary Harney, the PD Minister of State. While she personally rejected the intent of the bills and criticised the government 's failure to secure consensus, she would not vote against them. On 15 October, the Taoiseach committed the government to publishing the heads of a bill which would be introduced if the electorate rejected the existing wording. This bill would, as the Taoiseach had threatened earlier, include the provision of suicide as grounds for termination of pregnancy. Strategically, this was a wise move on the part of Fianna F&/ail \u00d0 already becoming isolated as all forces come into the hands of the electorate and could split the fragile coalition of anti-abortion forces, who felt caught between a rock and a hard place.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "07003957-3688-4f97-990d-35010a696a07", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.582359+00:00"}

PERROTT \n  Department of Computer Science, Queen's University, Belfast, United Kingdom  \n I. INTRODUCTION \n The development of sequential computers has been helped by the fact that the underlying hardware has essentially followed the same architectural model, known as the  von Neumann model.  The improvements in this model were caused primarily by advances in component technology; each improvement led to better performance in each generation of computers based on this model. Thus sequential computers have had a model of computation that formed a relatively stable base for the development of languages and tools. This is one of the main reasons for the widespread use of these tools and languages, however, the same cannot be said in the case of parallel machines. \n Parallelism has always been utilised in component technology but only in the 1970s did it become explicitly available in a machine architecture for the programmer; e.g., the Cray-1. It was not until the 1980s that commercially available parallel machines incorporating a wide variety of architectures were introduced; e.g., AMT distributed array processor, Convex, Alliant, Hypercub, Cray X-MP. \n It was the scientific community that first discovered the limitations of sequential machines in their applications. Applications such as weather forecasting were limited in their usefulness by the lack of sufficient processing power to deliver the results in a realistic time scale. The developments in component technology made it clear that the required increase in speed could never be obtained on sequential machines and that the only solution on offer was that of parallel computing. \n Hence, one of the main promises of parallel processing is that the speed up in the execution of an application would be substantial and that this speed up would increase as the amount of parallelism in the system increases. As a consequence users would be able to attempt to solve larger problems as the machine 's capabilities and functionality increases. \n Such improvements are possible only because of the economics of mass produced VLSI components. The production of such components increasingly favours parallel systems built mainly from cheap processors. Early results of experiments using parallel machines report a price-performance advantage in the range of 10 to 30 times better than traditional machines (Wadsworth, 1988). However, such comparisons usually ignore the cost of software, in particular, the effort involved in programming the parallel machine, which has been shown to be a nontrivial exercise requiring considerable skill and expertise. The developments in parallel software are not so far reaching nor so nearly well understood as the developments in parallel hardware. \n In the case of sequential computers the architectural model, the programming paradigms and the method of constructing algorithms all have a single objective. In the case of parallel computers there is at present no single architectural model to represent parallelism but rather a variety of different parallel architectures. \n The main issue affecting the architectural model is how to organise multiple processors to execute in parallel. One of the first models was that of an array processor - the SIMD model - where multiple processors execute the same instruction but on different data; the processors operate under the control of a single processor, which broadcasts the instructions to be executed. Array processors are particularly suited to problems involving matrices, and some impressive results have been achieved. However, the main criticism of this model is that there is little flexibility in the architecture for problems that could benefit from the execution of different instructions at the same time - the MIMD model. \n The earliest MIMD models were based on the shared memory concept, where all the processors are connected to the same memory. In this scenario the processors can execute different parts of an application concurrently, thus ideally reducing the time to execute the complete program. However, this model can lead to severe memory contention problems as the processors attempt to access the same data. There is some question as to whether this model will scale to larger orders of parallelism. \n A more recent MIMD model is the distributed memory model, where each processor has its own local memory and processors communicate by passing messages. However, there is an overhead cost associated with such communication, which in many instances can be substantial. The amount of overhead is influenced by such factors as the distance between the two processors wishing to communicate and the interconnection topology. The distributed model is scalable to greater orders of parallelism than that currently implemented. \n In the case of parallel software the choice of programming language is no longer confined to a single approach. The main division of these languages is into either imperative or declarative languages. The declarative group can be further divided into logic and functional languages while the imperative group consist of procedural and object-oriented languages. \n All the various languages that have been proposed offer some different way of capitalising on the power of parallel machines. To date it is not clear if any one approach is substantially better than any other as enough experience has not yet been accumulated. In many cases the concepts have not been efficiently implemented on parallel machines. In addition there is a considerable lack of tools to assist in all aspects of parallel programming and debugging. One consideration, which was perhaps not so important with sequential languages, is the ability to prove a program correct. This is becoming increasingly important as parallel machines are applied to more crucial aspects of human applications. However, the criteria for judging a language 's design that were established for sequential languages are still valid; criteria such as readability, simplicity, efficiency and expressiveness. \n The third important aspect of programming parallel systems is the choice of algorithm. Studies have shown that transferring an efficient sequential algorithm to a parallel machine results in an inefficient parallel algorithm. It is now apparent that the design and construction of a new parallel algorithm for a particular application area can produce major performance improvements. \n Hence, in the case of parallel systems there are three important and contributing factors; namely, the architectural model, the programming language and the choice of algorithm. The following sections concentrate on the programming language. \n II. APPROACHES TO PARALLEL PROGRAMMING \n Essentially, three main methods have been used to promote the wider use of parallel processing: (i)  Extend an existing sequential language with features to represent parallelism.  The advantage of extensions is that existing software can be transferred to a new parallel machine with relative cases. This is possible because programmers are already trained in the base language and can introduce the extensions gradually as they become more familiar with the situation in which they should be used and the effect they produce. However, experience to date has shown that extension languages have been limited to a certain range of hardware and to machines with a small number of processors. Problems have also been reported in the debugging of programs written in such languages, as the interaction of the sequential and the parallel features can give rise to difficulties in detecting errors. A more general problem is that many of these extensions have been developed by different groups using the same language base, which has led to nonstandard variants of the same language being produced, making the production of a standard for such languages difficult. \n (ii)  Implicit: use a sequential language but rely on the compiler to detect which parts of the program can be executed in parallel. Most of the work in this area is based on FORTRAN and examines the DO loops of the program to determine if it is possible to spread the iterations of the loop across different processors. \n The advantage of such an approach is that existing sequential programs can be moved relatively inexpensively and quickly to the parallel machine. This can represent a substantial saving in development costs and is an attractive proposition for many purchasers of a new parallel machine. However, it is rare that the full parallelism of the program is exploited without the help of a programmer to restructure the program; this usually requires a reorganisation of the loops of the program so that the automatic detection techniques will work. \n In the case of the construction of new programs it is advisable that a programmer have some knowledge of the detection techniques if as much parallelism as possible is to be detected. This represents a diversion for a programmer from the main task of program construction. In addition, such an approach inhibits the development of parallel languages and algorithms as it is confined to a sequential notation. \n (iii)  Develop a new parallel language.  In this case a completely new parallel language is developed, ignoring all existing languages and applications. The main advantage of this approach is that a coherent approach to parallelism is presented. The parallel notation will enable a user to express directly the parallelism in an application and, in addition, will assist with the development of new parallel algorithms. However, it does mean that a user will have to rebuild the entire software base in the new language, which is a labour intensive, expensive and perhaps an error prone exercise. All existing applications are ignored, which requires courage on the part of the management of large installations, particularly since many new languages have not had the property of longevity. \n IMPLICIT PARALLELISM \n Recent years have demonstrated that parallel processors are now a viable and commercially successful product and that it is the software for these machines which is lagging behind and causing the most difficulties. The highly successful tactic of Cray in the 1970s, of providing a FORTRAN engine, a machine that would take existing FORTRAN programs and detect which parts could be automatically vectorised, is the objective for the newer breed of multiprocessors only now based on parallelism. The origins of many of these systems can be traced to the research of David Kuck at the University of Illinois on vectorisation technique. This research has been extended to incorporate the situation where many processors, possibly vector processors, share the same memory. The model used for most shared memory machines is very similar in nature. However there may be differences in how the processors and memory interact; for example, in the Cray X-MP the connections between processors and memory are direct while on the Alliant and Convex a bus is used to connect memory and processors. The latter machines incorporate a data cache memory to provide acceptable access times, but it is not significant enough to disrupt their classification as shared memory machines. Such factors are not relevant as far as the programming of these machines is concerned. \n In general, the main tactic of parallelisation systems is to examine nested DO loops, with the object of vectorising the innermost loop and parallelising the outermost loop. The methods rely on data dependence analysis techniques that determine the flow of data in a program. This, in turn, enables statements to be identified that can be executed in parallel. Data dependence analysis is the cornerstone on which all automatic parallelism detection methods are built; the quality of a paralleliser is directly related to the quality of the dependence analyser. \n Currently techniques are available for nested DO loops but have not yet been commercially applied to complete programs. This requires full interprocedural analysis - the tracking of data across procedure calls - to be performed on a user program. Once a compiler uses interprocedural information as a basis for compiling time decisions, data dependencies between procedures in a program can be resolved. The systems at Rice University and IBM provide a limited form of interprocedural analysis. \n There are certain parallel programming situations that can be automatically parallelised without any user intervention. The most straightforward situation consists of loops with no data dependency between the iterations. In this case the iterations can be assigned to the processors either individually or in groups depending on the scheduling algorithms. In some systems the programmer can decide. \n In other situations if there is a possibility of a data dependency the compiler takes a conservative view, which usually means that no parallelisation is attempted. The burden is then placed on the programmer to decide if the compiler 's decision should be overridden; this is achieved by a user inserting compiler directives into the program code. This is particularly the case in situations where interprocedural analysis is required as most existing systems are not capable of performing this analysis. This is not always an easy decision and can require a considerable level of skill on behalf of the programmer. To help with parallelisation several manufacturers have incorporated into their hardware special features to handle synchronisation of the processors. This, in turn, can be used when processing, in parallel, different iterations of a DO loop that has data dependencies. For example, the Alliant machines have a concurrency control bus that is used to reduce the overhead involved in processor synchronisation and can be utilised in loops with data dependencies.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "3cb4186a-97b3-4f3a-8c63-3a3a7a8410d9", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.583502+00:00"}

BAILLIE  \n The Queen 's University of Belfast, School of Geosciences, Palaeoecology Centre Belfast BT17 1NN, Northern Ireland \n  ABSTRACT.  Accurate high-precision  14  C dating (i.e. <*> plus or minus sign </*> 20 yr precision or less on the  14  C date) provides the narrowest calendrical band width and, hence, the best age range determination possible. However, because of the structure in the  14  C calibration curve, the calendar age range for a given  14  C precision is not constant throughout the calibration range. In this study, we quantify the calendar band widths for a range of  14  C precisions throughout the calibration range. We show that an estimate of the likely calendar band width in years can be obtained from the expression:  We also show that calendar band widths are widest around 4000 BP at the start of the Bronze Age, and become narrow through the later Bronze Age and Iron Age and back into the Neolithic.\n  INTRODUCTION  \n  14  C dates are reported as BP values with an associated precision (Stuiver <*> ampersand </*> Polach 1977). Typically, the quoted error represents <*> plus or minus sign </*> , one standard deviation (1 <*> lower case sigma </*>), as determined by the total number of accumulated counts for that sample. Most laboratories also include an error multiplier that reflects the uncertainty associated with repeated dating of identical sample material. The  14  C date and total associated error are then converted to a calendar date (Stuiver 1989), using the internationally agreed  14  C calibration curve determined by Stuiver and Pearson (1986) and Pearson and Stuiver (1986) using a computer program developed by Stuiver and Reimer (1986). Probabilistic calibration techniques have also been developed by van der Plicht and Mook (1989) and Stuiver and Reimer (1987). Calibration introduces two additional sources of uncertainty in the final calendar date. First, because the calibration curve, itself, is a set of  14  C measurements made at decadal/bidecadal resolution on dendrochronologically dated wood, each point on the curve has an associated  14  C error and error multiplier. Second, because the curve is not smooth, but contains considerable structure, the calendrical band width for a  14  C date of a given precision varies at different points on the calibration curve. \n Stuiver and Pearson (1986), Pearson and Stuiver and Becker (1986) published high-precision  14  C calibration data in the Calibration Issue of  RADIOCARBON  (Stuiver <*> ampersand </*> Kra 1986). In their papers, they included tables of calibrated age ranges, for a set of  14  C precisions, at dates in the 80-4020 BP range in bidecadal intervals. These tables provide a useful guide to the calendar band width that can be expected for a  14  C date of a given precision, but are restricted in range (80-4020 BP), and do not readily inform the user of the variations in band width as a function of  14  C dates within the calibration range. This will be of use to archaeologists, who should be able to obtain an estimate of laboratory  14  C precision based on sample size and expected age, and thereby determine whether or not the probable calendrical band width is useful. We also show that calibration band widths are greatest for all precisions around 4000 BP, at the start of the Bronze Age, and decrease through the later Bronze Age and Iron Age and into the Neolithic. This is attributed to the greatest rate of change of <*> delta sign </*>  14  C being near 4000 BP. \n  METHOD  \n Stuiver and Reimer (1986) compiled a data set, ATM20, for use in their\ncalibration computer program. This file consists of calendar dates derived by dendrochronology and the associated  14  C dates and errors at dacadal/bidecadal intervals. In this study, we used ATM20 to determine the calendrical band widths of  14  C dates at a series of precisions. The method involved fitting a cubic spline curve to the data set and interpolating at intervals of one year. Figure 1 shows the cubic spline interpolation superimposed on a linear interpolation (Stuiver <*> ampersand </*> Reimer 1986) of a section of the original data. Checks at a range of  14  C dates showed that both techniques yielded calendrical band widths that were within a few years of each other. We chose the spline because we agree with Suess and Linick (1990) that unknown parts of a function in nature can best be approximated by a spline. Having obtained the spline we then stepped through  14  C age (1 step every 5  14  C yr)from 8100-150 BP, and recorded the calendar ages at the intercepts of the values\n with the calibration curve. The difference between the calendar ages at the intercepts gives the calendrical band width for a given  14  C date and associated precision. The band widths, as a function of  14  C age (BP), were plotted for four  14  C precisions in Figure 2 (A-D). \n\n RESULTS \n Figures 2(A-D) allow users of  14  C dates to ascertain what level of  14  C precision is required to obtain a given calendar band width at any time during the past nine millennia. The figures also show that even at the highest precisions (Fig. 2A), short intervals (  e.g.  , 2400-2500 BP 7900-8000 BP) exist when the advantages of high-precision dating are minimal. The period, 4000-5300 BP (  i.e. , the Neolithic to the beginning of the Bronze Age) gives the largest calendrical band widths. As the dating precision decreases from \"high\" to \"routine\" (  i.e.  , <*> plus or minus sign </*> 50 yr) the calendrical band widths widen (Fig. 2B), but the trends in band width remain similar, with the 4000-5300 BP period giving the largest uncertainties in calendar dates. The mean calendrical band widths for precisions of <*> plus or minus sign </*> 20 and <*> plus or minus sign </*> 50 yr, found by averaging all band widths over 8100-150 BP, is 101 yr and 158 yr, respectively. \n Figure 2(C, D) shows that, as the dating precision decreases, the graphs representing calendrical band width as a function of  14  C precision take on a sinusoidal form, with an amplitude of M  ca  250 yr and a period of 12,000 yr (assumed by extrapolation). The peak of the curve is at  ca.  4000 BP which is the point of greatest rate of change of <*> delta </*>  14  C in the radiocarbon record (Fig. 3). Thus, as the precision decreases, the band width reflects more closely the rate of change of <*> delta </*>  14  C. To illustrate this graphically, we fitted a 4th-order Legendre polynomial to the <*> delta sign </*>  14  C data derived from the ATM20 data set. We differentiated the resultant polynomial, plotted the calendrical band widths as a function of calendar year, and superimposed the differentiated curve to show the good correspondence between peaks and troughs (Fig. 4). This illustrates that subtle changes in slope of the calibration curve are mimicked in the calendrical band widths at the lower precisions. \n As the  14  C dating precision decreases, the calendrical band width increases. Figure 5 shows the mean calendrical band width over 7950  14  C vs. the  14  C precision of <*> plus or minus sign </*> 20,<*> plus or minus sign </*> 50, <*> plus or minus sign </*> 100, <*> plus or minus sign </*> 150 and <*> plus or minus sign </*> 200 yr. A linear regression fit to these data gives  \n CONCLUSIONS \n The band width of calendar dates  vs.   14  C age (for dates with  14  1 <*> sigma </*> <*> greater than sign </*> 100 yr) can be approximated by a sinusoid with an amplitude of  ca.  250 yr and a period of ca. 12,00 yr with a peak at 4000 BP. For low-precision dates, this result illustrates the response of calibrated age range to long-term variations of atmospheric  14  C, and specifically, to the long-term rate of change of <*> delta </*>  14  C. \n Although evidence for a similar cyclical variation exists in the band widths obtained at higher precisions (  i.e.  , 1 <*> sigma </*> < 50 yr), the calendar age range is dominated by a series of isolated periods with very large band widths, even for precisions as low as <*> plus or minus sign </*> 20 yr. These correspond to periods of rapid fluctuations or slow change in the atmospheric  14  C content. \n A linear relationship exists between  14  C dating precision and the mean calendrical band width, found by averaging all band widths over 8100-150 BP \n\n Thus, for high-precision dates (  i.e.,  <*> plus or minus sign </*> 20 yr), the calendar age range is typically 100 yr, whereas for routine dates ( <*> plus or minus sign </*> 50 yr), a 160-yr band width can be expected. Of course, these dates will be modulated by the variability noted above and can only be used as a guide. \n ACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n F. G.

Brent Irvine, Michael Ennis, and Carvell H. Williams  Division of Biochemistry, School of Biology and Biochemistry, The Queen's University of Belfast, Medical Biology Centre, 97 Lisburn Road, Belfast BT9 7BL, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom  \n Received August 14, 1989 \n  A simple, inexpensive, and sensitive assay for peptidase activity has been devised. The assay was performed in a microtiter plate and was based on flourogenic peptide substrates, many of which are commercially available. 7-Amino-4-methyl coumarin the flourescent product liberated during an incubation period of between 1 and 16 h, was detected by inspection of the plate under ultraviolet light of wavelength 356 nm. A fluorometer was not required. Using <*> alpha sign </*> -chymotrypsin as a model enzyme, with succinyl-L-alanyl-L-analyl-L-prolyl-L-phenylalanine 4-methyl-coumarlyl-7-amide as substrate, it was shown that as little as 4 fmol of enzyme could be detected. The method was non-quantitative and was particularly suited to location of enzyme activity in fractions during a purification procedure. The validity of the assay was demonstrated by detection of activity of a known enzyme, <*> alpha sign </*> -chymotrypsin, after its purification by size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography. The method was used to locate two forms of aminopeptidase activity, in fractions from size-exclusion chromatography of an extract from reproductive tissue of  Helix aspersa,  using L-leucine 4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide as substrate.  \n Some of the most sensitive methods for assaying proteolytic enzymes are based on the liberation of a fluorescent product from a fluorogenic reactant. These methods are normally used in a quantitative manner to titrate the enzyme (1) or to estimate its concentration by relating an initial velocity to one given by a standard solution of enzyme (2). A spectrofluorometer is needed for accurate determinations of fluorescent product concentration and the reaction is carried out in a cuvette, a relatively laborious procedure if many samples are to be assayed. Dresden  et al.  (3) have outlined the savings that accrue in time and reagent volumes when enzyme assays are performed in microtiter plates containing 96 wells. These authors developed a microtiter plate assay for a cathepsin B-like enzyme from  Schistosoma mansoni  using the fluorogenic substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-arginine 4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide. The fluorescent product, (AMC), 1  7-amino-4-methyl coumarin was measured using an inverted fluorescence microscope, enabling the reaction kinetics of the system to be determined. The authors also pointed out the potential of the method for screening for peptidases of different specificity using appropriate fluorogenic peptide substrates. However, in many cases it is not necessary to estimate the concentration of an enzyme or to determine its kinetic behavior but merely to establish whether it is present in a sample. This would apply particularly to the location of enzyme activity in fractions obtained during a purification procedure. It could also be of value in screening potential inhibitors. To this end we have developed a microtiter plate assay, using fluorogenic substrates, that enables us to locate peptidase activity by inspection of the plate under an ultraviolet lamp. No expensive spectrofluorometric instrumentation is needed and a permanent record is easily obtained by photographing the illuminated microtiter plate. The method is illustrated with reference to the purification of aminopeptidase activities from reproductive tissue of the garden snail,  Helix aspersa.  \n MATERIALS AND METHODS \n The following enzymes were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO): <*> alpha sign </*> -chymotrypsin Type II (C4129); <*> alpha sign </*> -chymotrypsin Type VI inactivated with DEP (C1012); leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) Type from porcine kidney cytosol (L9876). Succinyl-L-alanyl-L-alanyl-L-prolyl-L-phenylalanine 4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide (Suc-AAPF-AMC) was purchased from Peninsula Laboratories, Inc. Belmont, CA). Succinyl-L-analyl-L-phenylalanine 4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide (Suc-AAF-AMC) was supplied by Sigma. AMC was prepared by the method of Zimmerman  et al  (2). L-Leucine 4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide (L-AMC) was prepared by the general method for the preparation of amides described by Yasutake and Powers (4). \n Absolute concentrations of solutions of <*> alpha sign </*> -chymotrypsin were determined by titration with 4-methylumbelliferyl-p-trimethylammonium cinnamate chloride (Sigma) using the method of Jameson  et al.  (1) and a TKO 100 minifluorometer (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, Newcastle, UK). Microtiter plate assays for peptidase activity were carried out in a MircoFLUOR plate (Dynatech, Billinghurst, UK) covered with a plastic lid. A stock solution (8.1 mM) of Suc-AAPF-AMC was made up in dimethyl sulfoxide. All other solutions were made up in 0,1 M Tris-HCI buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 mM CaCl  2  . Each well contained a final volume of 375 <*> mu sign </*> l. To view the plate it was placed between two dual-wavelength ultraviolet lamps (Baird and Tatlock, Romford, UK) operated at 356 nm. The photograph shown in Fig. 1 was taken using an Olympus OM-1 camera equipped with a Zuiko MC Auto-Macro lens fitted with uv (0) and polarizing filters (Hoya). Kodak Tri-X 135 film was exposed for 10 s at aperture f 11. \n Reproductive tissue was dissected from freshly killed snails and was frozen in liquid nitrogen. On partial thawing, the tissue was finely chopped using a scalpel and was then homogenized in 0.1 M Tris-HCI buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mM CaCl  2 , 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.25 M sucrose (1 g tissue/4 ml buffer) at 4 <*> degrees sign </*> C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 50,000g for 30 min at 4 <*> degrees sign </*> C and the supernatant was stored at -20 <*> degrees sign </*> C. The protein concentration of the supernatant was measured by the method of Lowry  et al.  (5) using bovine serum albumin (Sigma A4378) as standard. \n High-performance size-exclusion liquid chromatography of this supernatant was carried out in 20 mM Tris-HCI buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.25 M NaCl and 10 mM CaCl  2  on a TSK preColumn (7,5 X 75 mm) linked in series with two TSK-G2000-SW columns (7,5 X 300 mm) from LKB (Uppsala, Sweden) (Fig. 2). The chromatography was performed with a Model 510 pump, a U6K injector, and a 441 absorbance detector (Waters, Harrow, UK) linked to a 2001 series chart recorder (Vitatron, Maidenhead, UK). Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected manually and were stored at -20 <*> degrees sign </*> C prior to assay. \n RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n Incubation of peptidases for 16 h at room temperature (about 20 <*> degrees sign </*> C) with an appropriate fluorogenic substrate produced a fluorescent product that was visible upon illumination of the microtiter plate with ultraviolet light (Fig. 1). Incubation times of a few hours were normally sufficient and an overnight incubation was only needed in cases where enzyme activity was very low. For example, in the assay shown in Fig. 1, activity was detectable after a 3-h incubation in all the wells that became strongly fluorescent after 16 h. \n Whereas AMC has excitation and emission maxima at 345 and 445 nm, respectively, when the amino group is converted to an amide, for example in a fluorogenic peptide substrate, these values are shifted down to 325 and 395 nm, respectively (2). Commercially available ultraviolet lamps emit light of 356 nm, which corresponds closely to the desired excitation maximum for AMC. Under such illumination, fluorogenic substrate of concentration 10 <*> mu sign </*> M emitted a dark purple fluorescent light that appeared to the naked eye to be much less intense than that due to an equivalent concentration of AMC. There was, however, a definite background fluorescence in substrate-containing wells. This can be seen by comparison of well B10 (Fig. 1), containing 10 <*> mu sign </*> M Suc-AAPF-AMC, with well A10, containing only buffer. This background increased markedly if concentrations of substrate in excess of 10 <*> mu sign </*> M were used, making it more difficult to differentiate between wells where AMC was generated and those where it was not. Nonetheless, it was possible to use substrate concentrations up to 100 <*> mu sign </*> M since the intensity of the fluorescence due to the higher concentration of AMC produced under these conditions compensated to some degree. This would be particularly useful for substrates with relatively high K  m  values for the enzyme, where the reaction might otherwise be very slow. Because the Tri-X film used for the photograph in Fig. 1 was sensitive to ultraviolet light, a uv(0) filter with a cut-off value of 400 nm was used to give a photograph that more accurately matched the image seen with the naked eye. A polarizing filter was used to minimize light reflected from the glossy black surface of the MicroFLUOR plate. This plate is designed for assays based on fluorescence and is made from opaque black plastic so that light is confined within each well and does not illuminate adjacent wells, as happens with transparent plates. \n Standards containing decreasing concentrations of AMC were added to wells 1 to 10 in Row A. Concentrations below 1 <*> mu sign </*> M (wells A7-A10) did not produce visible fluorescence. The use of substrate concentrations of 10 <*> mu sign </*> M appeared to be optimal in terms of minimizing intrinsic fluorescence due to substrate yet providing sufficient product to see clearly. It also conserved substrate. For example, 1 mg of Suc-AAPF-AMC was sufficient for 400 wells. The visual assay was intrinsically less sensitive than a spectrofluorometric assay, since concentrations of AMC 100-fold lower could be measured using an instrument. Nevertheless, very low concentrations of peptidase activity could easily be detected after an overnight incubations. From Row B it is clear that a concentration of <*> alpha sign </*> -chymotrypsin of 0.2 ng/well (B5) gave rise to clear fluorescence after 16 h at 20 <*> degrees sign </*> C. The well B1 became strongly fluorescent immediately after addition of enzyme (0.2 <*> mu sign </*> g protein/well) after a few minutes, and B3 (20 ng protein/well) within 30 min. The presence of other proteins did not affect the method, since inclusion of 0.01 <*> per cent sign </*> serum albumin in all solutions did not alter the results illustrated in Row B (data not shown). The results shown in Row C were obtained using the same conditions as those in Row B except that <*> alpha sign </*> -chymotrypsin that had been inactivated with DFP was used. This material was stated to have residual activity of 0.1 unit/mg compared to 52 units/mg for the uninhibited enzyme. This 500-fold decrease in activity was clear in our assay since only at a 1000-fold higher concentration (0.2 <*> mu sign </*> g protein/well, well C2) was a positive result obtained. The operational molarity of the stock solution (0.1 mg/ml) of <*> alpha sign </*> -chymotrypsin, determined by titration with 4-methylumbelliferyl-p-trimethylammonium cinnamate chloride, was found to be 2.084 <*> plus or minus sign </*> 0.004 <*> mu sign </*> M (mean <*> plus or minus sign </*> SD of six measurements). This compared with a theoretical value of 4.27 <*> mu sign </*> M based on weight, so that the lyophilized protein contained 49 <*> per cent sign </*> active enzyme. Consequently, the amount a <*> alpha sign </*> -chymotrypsin present in well B5 (the lowest concentration of enzyme that gave a positive result) was actually about 0.1 ng or 4 fmol. Thus, using an overnight incubation it was possible to detect very low concentrations of enzyme, provided that a good substrate (one that was substantially converted to product during this period) such as Suc-AAPF-AMC was available. On the other hand the substrate Suc-AAF-AMC did not provide as sensitive an assay for <*> alpha sign </*> -chymotrypsin and concentrations of the enzyme two orders of magnitude higher than those detectable using Suc-AAPF-AMC were needed to give a positive result (data not shown). L-AMC did not provide a very sensitive assay for LAP. Only at concentrations of at least 3.8 <*> mu sign </*> g protein/well (well D2) was LAP detectable using L-AMC as substrate. The sensitivity was increased 100-fold, however, if calcium in the assay buffer was replaced by magnesium, which has been shown to activate LAP (6). Thus, in the presence of MgSO  4  (5mM), LAP at a concentration of 38 ng protein/well gave a weakly positive result (data not shown). \n The method has been applied to the detection of peptidase activity in fractions obtained during a purification procedure. Two aminopeptidase activities, separated by size-exclusion chromatography of a preparation from reproductive tissue of  H. aspersa  (Fig. 2), were readily detected (wells E1-E4 and E7-F1). Indeed wells E2 and E8, where maximal activities were found, gave positive results after incubation for 30 min. The apparent molecular weights of proteins eluted in fractions 2 and 8, corresponding to the peak position of the two iminopeptidase activities, were estimated, by comparison with the elution volumes of immunoglobulin G and serum albumin, to be <*> 'less than' sign </*> 160,000 and about 65,000, respectively. \n In order to establish that under ideal conditions the microtiter plate assay detects the appropriate material, a sample of a known enzyme, <*> alpha sign </*> -chymotrypsin, was subjected to size-exclusion chromatography on the same system. From inspection of Fig. 3 it can be seen that the peak of enzyme activity in fractions 19 and 20 corresponded exactly to the protein peak as measured by absorbance at 214 nm.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "abfe496e-97df-422c-a109-63ee48d3766d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.585115+00:00"}

McFerran, W.I. Montgomery and J.H. McAdam \n ABSTRACT \n Grazing pressures have increased on the uplands of the British Isles. This is particularly evident on the Antrim Plateau of north-east Ireland. The effects of grazing pressure on heathland vegetation and ground beetle assemblages was investigated experimentally. Between June and September in 1988 and 1989, enclosures (0.64ha) on three types of heathland community <*> dash sign </*> low, medium and high density of  Calluna  <*> dash sign </*> were grazed at one of four intensities equivalent to 0-4.5 Scottish Blackface sheep/ha. The effects of grazing intensity on above-ground biomass, individual species cover, botanical composition, sward structure and associated ground beetle assemblages were assessed using standard methods. At higher grazing intensities, percentage composition of green heather, live Gramineae species, live non-Gramineae species and other dead material declined. Live  Calluna  was reduced by increased grazing intensity once more nutritious species were depleted. Ground beetle assemblages differed with respect to heathland community, grazing intensity and trapping dates. Trapping success of the most abundant species,  Nebria salina,  increased with increasing grazing intensity. The effects of management changes on the ecosystem of the Antrim Plateau are discussed. \n INTRODUCTION \n Economic pressures over the last four decades have increased livestock numbers in hill areas (Eadie 1984). The increased grazing pressure has resulted in significant changes in the natural vegetation of these areas. Ball  et al.  (1982) described the loss of plant communities with a high conservation value, such as those dominated by heather, and the increase in less valuable grasses and mosses. \n Little is known of the effects of management on the wildlife of upland heaths, but recent changes in management practices such as moor drainage, reduction in burning and more intensive grazing have prompted concerns over the loss or decline in abundance of some species (Gimingham 1985); Hudson 1986). Welch (1984a, 1984b) suggested that heather declined when stocking rates were greater than 0.2 cattle and 2.7 sheep/ha. Subsequent studies by Grant, Barthram  et al.  (1978) and Grant, Milne  et al.  (1982) indicate that under 'severe' grazing pressure, height, cover, standing crop, shoot production and flowering of the heather stand are reduced. Under 'moderate' grazing pressure, however, productivity may be unaffected and accumulation of biomass slowed down, resulting in reduced necessity to burn (Hudson 1986). \n Since entry to the EC and the adoption of the Less Favoured Areas directive in 1975, stocking densities of sheep and cattle have increased on Northern Ireland hill farms (McAdam and Chance 1988; McAdam 1992). The effects of these increases on the plant and animal communities of the uplands of north-east Ireland are poorly documented (Meharg and Montgomery 1988). This paper reports experimental investigations carried out to determine the response of indigenous heath vegetation and associated assemblages of ground beetles to a range of grazing intensities corresponding to 0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 times the stocking levels characteristic of hill farms in County Antrim. The results are discussed with respect to the future conservation of wildlife and current management practices prevailing in the Antrim Plateau. \n MATERIALS AND METHODS \n The Greenmount Agricultural and Horticultural College Hill Farm, Department of Agriculture (NI), Glenwherry, Co. Antrim (Irish Grid Reference D279000), lies between 250m and 400m above sea-level. The topography, land use and history of Glenwherry are described in detail elsewhere (McAdam and Chance 1988; Meharg 1988; McFerran 1991). Replicate blocks (0.64ha) of three vegetation types (overgrazed short  Calluna  (5-10 <*> per cent sign </*> cover) with  Eriophorum  and  Scirpus , here termed low-density heath;  Calluna  (40-50 <*> per cent sign </*> cover) with  Deschampsia  and  Eriohorum , here termed medium-density heath; and mature, dense  Calluna  (85-95 <*> per cent sign </*> cover), constituting high-density heath) were selected and fenced on the Point and Creeve hills, approximately 1km apart. Within each block, four adjacent plots were subject to one of four grazing regimes (none, and approximately 1.5, 3.0 and 4.5 mature Scottish Blackface wethers per hectare) from June to September in 1988 and 1989. All grazed plots were 80m <*> multiplication sign </*> 80m and the ungrazed control was 80m <*> multiplication sign </*> 20m. Normal grazing intensity at Glenwherry is approximately 3 sheep/ha, Grazing plots were located randomly in each of the heath density blocks. Two replicate blocks (260m <*> multiplication sign </*> 80m) of low- and high-density heath were utilised in the present study. Given the time available and the quantity of material collected, only one block of medium-density heath was investigated. \n Species composition, biomass and plant community structure were measured in each plot in June and September 1988 and 1989. A modified Hill Farm Research Organisation sward stick was used to determine canopy height (mean of 320 and 80 readings in each grazed and ungrazed plot respectively). Above-ground biomass and percentage species composition by dry weight of the vegetation was determined from five randomly located 0.25m  2  quadrats clipped to ground level. Sward structure was determined using an inclined point quadrat (IPQ) with approximately 200 hits per plot. Cover and botanical composition were assessed using a point quadrat (200 hits of a vertical needle per plot). Baseline data from June 1988 were used for comparison with results obtained in September 1989 to determine the overall impact of grazing. Although samples were taken at different times of the year, the dominance of herbaceous species in the stands and the detailed nature of the sampling techniques seem likely to permit a valid comparison of vegetation data from the beginning and end of the experiment. Plant nomenclature follows Tutin  et al.  1964-80. \n Between May and October 1989, ten pitfall traps (polythene containers 9cm in diameter and 20cm deep) were set at 10m intervals along the south-west to north-east diagonal of each plot. Approximately 250ml of 5 <*> per cent sign </*> formalin solution, with a few drops of detergent, was added to prevent the escape and deterioration of specimens before collection. Traps were emptied 2-4-week intervals throughout the study period. Material obtained was frozen at -5 <*> degrees sign </*> C until sorted. All adult ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) were separated and stored in 70 <*> per cent sign </*> alcohol and later identified to species level. Nomenclature follows Lindroth 1974. Identifications were confirmed by Dr R. Anderson (Agricultural Chemistry Research Division, DANI). \n DATA ANALYSIS \n The effect of heathland community and grazing intensity on vegetation and ground beetle data in replicate blocks of low- and high-density heath was assessed using analyses of variance carried out on logarithmically transformed data (Sokal and Rholf 1981). A data matrix listing the presence or absence of each ground beetle species in each of the twenty plots was constructed. The total numbers of individuals of each species caught were not used in ordination and classification analyses since abundance data are influenced by factors other than population density, such as the activity patterns of individual species (Rushton  et al.  1989). Detrended correspondence analysis (DECORANA; Hill 1979a) was used to ordinate the ground beetle species and samples from the twenty plots. The non-parametric Spearman rank correlation (Zar 1984) was used to determine the relationship between Axes scores and botanical variables. This technique was used in preference to canonical correspondence analysis (Ter Braak 1987) as the number of samples involved and the number of environmental variables measured were limited. The plots were also classified on the basis of species presence and absence using two-way species indicator analysis (TWINSPAN; Hill 1979b). The ordination and classification methods employed have been used widely in analysis of invertebrate communities (for example Fishpool and Usher 1989; Luff  et al. 1992). \n RESULTS \n PLANTS \n  Biomass and species composition  \n Percentage species composition by dry weight varied with both heathland community and grazing intensity (Table 1). In September 1989, canopy heigth was significantly greater on high-density heath () than on low density heath, and increasing grazing intensity significantly reduced canopy height (). Increased grazing intensity also resulted in a significant increase and reduction in the percentage of dead heather () and other dead material () respectively.    Botanical composition-species cover  \n In September 1989, the percentage cover of  Eriophorum vaginatum  () and  Scirpus caespitosus  () were significantly greater and lower respectively on the high-density heath than on the low-density heath. By September 1989, increased grazing intensity significantly increased the proportions of live  Calluna vulgaris  () and  Erica cinerea  () and decreased the proportion of  Eriophorum vaginatum  (). Over time there was a significant increase in the proportion of moss species associated with the high-density heathland community (Table 2). Between 1988 and 1989 there was also a significant increase in the proportions of  Calluna vulgaris  and  Erica cinerea  on plots grazed at 3 and 4.5 sheep/ha. There was also a significant increase in the proportion of  Eriophorum vaginatum  () on the two plots subject to the lowest grazing intensities (Table 2; Fig. 1). \n  Vegetation structure  \n The botanical composition and species distribution as determined by IPQ changed over time and with grazing intensity. There was a greater density and proportion of  Calluna vulgaris  and  Eriophorum vaginatum  in the upper canopy horizons (20-30cm) of the high-density heath plots than in the low-density heath (Table 3; Fig. 2). Conversely,  Eriophorum vaginatum  and  Scirpus caespitosus  had a significantly greater abundance within the lower canopy horizons of the low-density heath than in the high-density heath. Comparison of sward structure between ungrazed plots and plots grazed at the highest intensity suggests that sward structure was independent of grazing pressure (Table 3; Fig. 3). However, increased grazing intensity resulted in a significant decline of dead  Eriophorum vaginatum  and  Eriophorum angustifolium  in comparison with control plots, in which dead material generally accumulated. The proportion of live  Calluna vulgaris  increased significantly with intensity of grazing in the 15-20cm horizon. \n GROUND BEETLE ASSEMBLAGES \n A total of 5510 carabid beetles of eighteen species were collected between May and September 1989 (Table 4). Three species,  Pterostichus niger, Nebria salina  and  Carabus granulatus , comprised over 63 <*> per cent sign </*> of the total catch. Catches of individuals and species on control plots were corrected to number per week for each of six sampling dates. Temporal changes in total numbers of individuals and species were similar, rising from May to reach a peak in August. There was a decline in individual abundance and number of species in September. Adult  Pterostichus niger  and  Nebria salina  made a major contribution to these patterns of abundance. \n Total numbers of individuals trapped did not differ significantly between heath type or with grazing intensity. However, in comparison with low-density heath, significantly greater numbers of species were recorded on the high-density heathland community (). Numbers of species trapped showed a significant increase with increasing grazing intensity (). Results for alpha diversity index and the Berger-Parker dominance index suggest that diversity differed significantly between grazing intensities (<&> equation inserted <&>) while dominance varied significantly with heath density (). The high-density heathland community had the highest alpha index and the second highest Berger-Parker index. The highest Berger-Parker index was recorded on the low-density heath. Total numbers of the four most abundant species,  Pterostichus niger, Nebria salina, Carabus granulatus  and  Carabus problematicus , were collated for each heathland community and associated grazing intensity. Numbers trapped on replicate plots of high- and low-density heathland communities were meaned to allow for comparison with the medium-density heath type. The most abundant species, Nebria salina, was trapped most frequently on low-density heath, numbers increasing progressively with increasing grazing intensity. There was increased trapping success for  Carabus granulatus  and  Pterostichus niger  with increased heath density.

Grazing significantly affected the numbers of  Carabus arvensis  trapped (), with greater numbers of individuals trapped on the ungrazed control plots. \n Investigation of ground beetles obtained from low- and high-density heathland communities and associated grazing intensities for six sampling dates between May and September 1989 suggested that total numbers of individuals and species varied significantly between sampling dates ( respectively) and heathland community ( respectively).

S. Guthrie, Robert F. Geraghty, G. Brent Irvine and Carvell H. Williams \n Division of Biochemistry, School of Biology <*> ampersand </*> Biochemistry, Medical Biology Centre, Queen's University, Belfast, UK BT9 7BL  \n The peptide pQDPFLRFamide is one of several closely related heptapetides found in invertebrates, including molluscs. Electrophysiological findings and ligand binding studies have both suggested that these heptapeptides probably interact with receptors distinct from those that are activated by the related tetrapeptide FMRFamide (also found in the same group of invertebrates), depite the fact that some syntetic  N  -terminally extended analogues of the latter show marked tetrapeptidelike activity. We have carried out structural studies, using 1- and 2-dimensional  1  H NMR, on pQDPFLRFamide and some synthetic analogues in which Asp-2 was replaced by Asn and Pro-3 by either Aib (<*> alpha sign </*> -amino isobutyric acid) of by Gly. The results are consistent with the suggestion that pQDPFLRFamide can adopt a bent conformation, which might form the basis of the selectivity of this and related heptapeptides. \n\n Two types of FMRFamide-related peptides (Farps) containing either four or seven amino acids have been found in several groups of invertebrates, including molluscs.  1,2  These peptides are thought to participate in a range of neuroregulatory functions. In the land snail  Helix aspersa,  the peptides include FXRFamide (X <*> equals sign </*> M or L) and XDPFLRFamide (X <*> equals sign </*> pQ, S or N).  3,4  Cloning of the gene that codes for the heptapeptides in this mollusc has revealed the presence of other, closely related heptapeptide sequences. 4  Electrophysiological studies in this species have indicated that these two groups of peptides probably act through different receptors. 5  Although ligandbinding studies have shown the presence of high and low affinity binding sites on membrane preparations from  Helix  tissues for the tetrapeptides and their analogues, 6-8  so far no specific high affinity binding site for the heptapeptides has been unequivocally demonstrated in such preparations. \n High affinity binding at the tetrapeptide-binding site is not restricted to peptides containing four amino acids. For example, some  N  -terminal extensions of FMRFamide or its analogues also interact efficiently at this site, in some cases with an affinity better than that of the natural ligand. 6,7  These include  N  -3 ( p  -hydroxyphenyl)propanoyl-FMRFamide, YFMRFamide and YGGFMRFamide. \n This is not the case for the naturally occurring heptapeptide Farps, which compete only weakly with tetrapeptides such as FMRFamide. 6-8  It is clear therefore that the particular  N  -terminal tripeptide sequence XDP in the heptapeptides must be crucial for discriminating between the tetrapeptide and putative heptapeptide receptors. One possible way in which this might happen is if the heptapeptides contained a turn in the region of the Asp-Pro sequence, since it has been shown that the sequence Asx-Pro is frequently found to occur at positions 1 and 2 of <*> beta sign </*> -turns in proteins and peptides.  9,10  Such a conformation might also be stabilised by electrostatic interactions between the side chains of the Asp and Arg residues. We have previously shown that the effects on agonist activity and ligand binding of substitutions of Asp or Pro in PQDPFLRFamide are broadly in keeping with the presence of a bent conformation, though the electrostatic interaction may not be obligatory for biological activity.  11  Evidence that might support this viewpoint has been sought by an NMR study of the pQDPFLRamide and some analogues. A preliminary report of part of this work has already been published. 12  \n It is unlikely that peptides such as those considered here will adopt a single conformation. All studies to date point to small linear peptides as possessing considerable conformational freedom and existing as an equilibrium over several conformations of similar energy.  13  The object of a study such as this must be to see if any conformation(s) or families of conformations exist with sufficient population to permit detection. 14  It is also relevant to consider the most appropriate solvent in which to study biomolecules. Water is often seen as the obvious choice,  15  but, as well as introducing some technical problems, a solution in water cannot really be considered typical of conditions prevailing  in vivo,  when many other ions and molecules will be present. Furthermore, we are more interested in predicting what may be the conformation of a peptide in a binding site, and such regions are usually assumed to be a lot less polar than bulk water. DMSO has often been used as a solvent not only because many peptides are readily soluble in it, but also with the hope that its polarity may be similar to that of the binding pocket in a receptor or enzyme. However, it has also been argued that,  in vivo  , layers of water near to a protein surface are more viscous than bulk water and that this increased viscosity, by reducing conformational mobility, may 'filter' an otherwise flexible peptide into a predominant conformation.  16  Mixtures of water and DMSO have higher viscosity than either solvent alone and have been suggested as an appropriate solvent for conformational studies.  15,16  \n  Experimental  \n  Synthesis. \u00d1 The following peptides used in this study were prepared by solid-phase synthesis, as described previously; . As reported, all peptides were purified using reversed-phase C  18  HPLC <*> mu sign </*> -Bondapak, Waters), gave satisfactory amino acid analyses (Picotag Analyser, Waters) and the expected molecular ions were observed in FAB mass spectrometry (VG AutoSpec. instrument at the SERC Mass Spectrometry Service Centre). In addition, the Gly  3  analogue was subjected to additional analysis to eliminate the possibility that complexities observed in the NMR spectrum were due to impurities. Capillary electrophoresis of this analogue (Thermo Separation Products) at pH 3.0, 4.5 and 9.1 and in the presence of SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) at pH 9.0 showed only one major component with an integrated value of 93 <*> per cent sign </*> . Similarly, electrospray mass spectrometry (VG Quattro instrument fitted with electrospray ionisation), which because it analyses the total sample is more likely than FABMS to detect all components present, identified one main component  m/z  <*> equals sign </*> 864.9;  M  , 863.4) with other species present at levels less than 1 <*> per cent sign </*> . \n  NMR Studies.  \u00d1 Experiments were carried out on samples prepared as follows. Approximately 5 mg of peptide was dissolved in deionised water and the pH adjusted to near 6.0. The solvent was removed under vacuum in a Speed VAC concentrator (Savant). The samples were further dried  in vacuo  over phosphorous pentoxide for 24 h. The peptide was then dissolved in  and in some cases this was further diluted with H  2  O. In one case the solvent used was  . Spectra were recorded on a Varian VXR-600S spectrometer at the Edinburgh University Ultra High Field NMR Service. \n  1  H NMR spectra were acquired with 32 K data points and Fourier transformed with zero filling into 64K points. For some spectra, an exponential line broadening factor of 0.5 was applied. 2D spectra were obtained by the Hypercomplex method of States, Heberkorn and Reuben  17  as 512 FIDs of 2 K data points and transformed with zero filling into 1K <*> multiplication sign </*> 2K points using either a sine bell or Gaussian window. Assignments of proton resonances in the peptides were made using several types of 2D spectra,  18a, 19   i.e.  DQF-COSY, TOCSY and ROESY. ROCSY spectra were acquired with a mixing time of 65 ms (for DMSO solution) or 80 ms (for DMSO/H  2  O solution) and ROESY spectra with mixing times of 150 (DMSO and H  2  O) or 200 ms (DMSO/H  2  O). For ROESY spectra, the frequency offset was varied to ensure that the observed cross peaks did not arise from Hartmann-Hahn transfer coupled with incoherent magnetisation transfer. 20  \n The temperature dependence of amide protons was determined from 1D spectra recorded at 5 <*> degrees sign </*> C intervals from 25 to 55 <*> degrees sign </*> C. In all cases the variations of the chemical shift of the amide proton with temperature was linear and the temperature coefficient was determined by linear regression analysis (correlation coefficients <*> less than or equal to sign </*> 0.95).\n  Results and Discussion  \n  1  H  Resonance Assignments.  \u00d1 The amide regions of the 1D spectra of the peptides are shown in Fig. 1. Detailed analyses of the NMR spectra of the peptides, under a variety of conditions were made using DQF-COSY, TOCSY and ROESY experiments and are summarised for pQDPFLRFamide and the Asn  2  and Aib  3  analogues in Tables 1 to 3, respectively. The temperature coefficients of the amide protons of the peptides are listed in Table 4. The effects of pH on the amide protons of pQDPFLRFamide are shown in Fig. 2. The nuclear Overhauser connectivities observed in ROESY spectra are summarised in Table 5 and two examples of the spectra obtained are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Moving the frequency offset in selected ROESY spectra by up to 300 Hz yielded essentially identical spectra.\n  Conformational Studies.  \u00d1 As mentioned above, the available evidence suggests that most small peptides exist as an ensemble of interconverting conformations. Inspection of the assignments reported in Tables 1 to 3 shows that considerable differences exist between the spectrum of pQDPFLRFamide and those of the Asn  2  , Aib  3  and Gly  3  analogues and between the spectra of pQDPFLRFamide recorded under different conditions. At the very least, this points to the various conformations available to the peptides being populated to different extents for each peptide or set of conditions. Examination of all the observed NMR spectra (Tables 1 to 3 and Fig. 1), the amide proton temperature coefficient (Table 4) and the nuclear Overhauser connectivities (Table 5), allows certain conclusions to be drawn. These will now be presented for pQDPFLRFamide and the Asn  2  and Aib  3  analogues. The Gly  3  analogue, which displays rather different behaviour, will be discussed later. \n  Configuration of the Asx-Pro peptide bond.  Under all the conditions used, the ROESY spectra obtained for pQDPFLRFamide and the Asn  2  analogue display a strong d <*> alpha and delta sign </*> (  i,i  <*> plus sign </*> 1) connectivity between Asx-2 and Pro-3, indicating that the peptide exists predominantly as the  trans  isomer of the Asx-Pro peptide bond.  18b  In several of the 1D spectra (  e.g. PQDPFLRFamide in H  2  O at pH 3.0 and the Asn  2  analogue in DMSO) a set of minor peaks is visible which could be due to a small fraction of molecules existing as the  cis  isomer, but no d <*> double alpha sign </*> (  i,i  + 1) or of d  N  <*> alpha sign </*> (  i,i  + 1) connectivities between Asx-2 and Pro-3, characteristics of a  cis  peptide bond, were ever observed. \n  Existence of a salt bridge between Asp-2 and Arg-6.  Several types of evidence suggest that such a salt bridge exists and has an influence on the conformation. \n  (a) Appearance of amide proton resonances.  The amide proton resonances of the Asn  2  analogue in both DMSO and DMSO/H  2  O are sharp, consistent with the averaging over the available conformations being essentially complete. However, for pQDPFLRFamide and the Aib  3  analogue in DMSO the amide resonances are broad. Again, this could be interpreted as a case of equilibria over an ensemble of conformers but now, because of the additional constraint of an internal salt bridge between the sidechains of Asp-2 and Arg-6, the rates of interconversion are slower ant the averaging of the NMR signals is less complete for the Asn  2  analogue. \n  (b) Differences in chemical shift values.  Compared with the Asn  2  analogue in DMSO, the amide proton resonance of Phe-4 in pQDPFLRFamide in DMSO has moved from 7.97 to 7.59 and the amide and <*> alpha sign </*> proton resonances of Leu-5 have moved from 7.30 and 4.29, respectively, to 7.77 and 3.95 (Tables 1 and 2). The corresponding residues in the Aib  3  analogue, where a salt bridge is also possible, have chemical shifts close to those of pQDPFLRFamide (Table 3). It is difficult to account for differences between pQDPFLRFamide and the Asn  2  analogue other than by postulating a major conformational difference due to a salt bridge. \n  (c) Variation with pH of the amide protons in pQDPFLRFamide.  Not only does the chemical shift of the Asp-2 amide proton vary as the pH is altered over a range covering the pK  a  of the Asp sidechain carboxyl group, but the Phe-4 and Arg-6 amide resonances also change dramatically (Fig. 2). Such changes imply that a major alteration in conformation, affecting most of the peptide, occurs on ionisation of the Asp sidechain. It seems most likely that this involves an increase in number of those conformers which allow a salt bridge between the sidechains af Asp-2 and Arg-6. If such a salt bridge exists in aqueous solution, it is even more likely to exist in solvents of lower dielectric constant.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "4502cd3c-400f-42df-b444-24091e9a7803", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.587010+00:00"}
{"text": "<Lymph system>\n\n\n<$A>\n  THE FORMATION OF LYMPH  \n The formation of lymph is influenced by the relative permeabilities of the blood capillary endothelium and the lymphatic capillary endothelium. Normal blood capillaries are impermeable to proteins of molecular weight less than 40 kD which may leak out and accumulate in the interstitium. Persistent leakage and accumulation would eventually result in edema formation. To avoid this situation, the lymphatic system acts by removing the excess tissue fluids and plasma proteins, i.e., lymph, and returning it to the bloodstream. In this way the homeostasis of the interstitial environment is maintained. The permeability of the blood capillary endothelium is limited. Although freely permeable to water and molecules less than 40 kD molecular weight, it is only semi permeable to colloid of protein molecular size. Consequently, only relatively small amounts of the total plasma protein cross the blood capillary wall. 37-39  \n  A. PERMEABILITY OF THE LYMPHATIC CAPILLARY ENDOTHELIUM  \n The pathways taken, and the forces involved in the movement of interstitial fluid and proteins (lymph) across the lymphatic endothelium into the lumen of the capillaries, are the subject of ongoing research. Two major pathways have been suggested; the first is via intercellular junctions and the second via cytoplasmic vesicles. Most of the work to determine the relative contribution of the two routes to lymphatic capillary transport has been carried out using macromolecular tracers. \n  1. Intercellular Junctions  \n The role of the intercellular junction was investigated by Leak  27  following interstitial injection of ferritin, thorium dioxide, carbon, and latex spheres. The results obtained indicate that these tracer substances are transported into and out of lymph via the intercellular junctions rather than by vesicular transport (Figure 6).  27  These results have been supported by numerous other studies.  22,40-42  \n The relative contribution of the two routes has also been examined following intravenous (I.V.) injection of tracers such as horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and ferritin.  24,25  These experiments, performed using renal lymphatics, are more physiologically relevant since the possibility of producing artificially high interstitial pressure is avoided by intravenous administration. The choice of HRP is particularly relevant since the possibility of producing artificially high interstitial pressure is avoided by intravenous administration. The choice of HRP is particularly relevant since this molecule has a molecular weight of 40 kD and a diameter of 5mm which is relatively close in size to that of plasma albumin (69 kD and a diameter of 7 nm). The results showed no significant difference in the proportions of widths of the intercellular junctions after administration of HRP or ferritin compared to the control The tracer molecules entered renal lymphatics rapidly after I.V. injection and were transported in part via normal (20 to 30 nm) intercellular spaces between adjacent endothelial cells.  24  \n Chylomicrons, which have a much larger diameter of approximately 200 nm, and are secreted in large numbers following a fatty meal, are transported into the intestinal lymphatics (lacteals) partly by the intercellular route (Figure 7).  28,43  \n  2. Vesicles  \n The studies described above of intercellular transport simultaneously assessed the role of vesicular transport, and the results imply that vesicular transport is also in important route for translymphatic transport and lymph formation.  20,24,27  Following I.V. injection of HRP, the volume density (i.e., the number) of small vesicles increased significantly and many of the vesicles contained the tracer.  24  The distribution of vesicles within the cytoplasm did not differ significantly from that of controls, thus indicating no major change in the mechanism of vesicular formation and movement. Yang et al.  24  therefore concluded that vesicles, if involved in translymphatic transport, may be stimulated by even a small increase in protein, in this study HRP, in the interstitium. \n O'Morchoe et al.  29  developed an  in vitro  model using the canine renal hilar lymphatics to study the temperature dependence of protein transport across the lymphatic endothelium. The rationale behind this study was that if vesicular transport does occur then the rate of protein movement would be temperature dependent, in keeping with the known effect of temperature on vesicles, i.e., a decrease with decreasing temperature. In contrast, if the protein moves only by diffusion between adjacent cells then temperature would have little relative effect on the rate. The results demonstrated that the rate of protein transport was influenced by temperature, being significantly reduced by 49 <*> per cent sign, </*> 31 <*> per cent sign </*> and 29 <*> per cent sign </*> when the temperature was lowered to 4 <*> degree sign, </*> 24 <*> degree sign </*> and 30 <*> degree sign </*> C, respectively, from an initial temperature of 37 <*> degree sign </*> C. When the temperature was raised to 48 <*> degree sign </*> C, the rate was significantly increased by 48 <*> per cent sign </*>. No significant changes in intercellular junctional or vesicular parameters were found between the control lymphatics and those perfused at 24 <*> degree sign </*> , 30 <*> degree sign </*> and 40 <*> degree sign </*> C, thus indicating that the integrity of the tissues was maintained. At 4 <*> degree sign </*> C vesicular size decreased, the number of free and luminal surfaces decreased. The authors concluded that the results obtained support the existence of a vesicular lymphatic transendothelial route. \n Dobbins and Rollins  28  demonstrated the role of vesicles in chylomicron transport in the intestinal lymphatics (Figure 7). Their results showed chylomicrons present within large pinocytotic vesicles opening to the abluminal side of the endothelia, others were completely enclosed within lacteal endothelia, and some were apparently \"emptying\" into the lacteal lumen. They concluded that the vesicular route is quantitatively more important than the intercellular route in the translymphatic transport of macromolecules including chylomicrons. \n While results have been published in support of both intercellular and vesicular routes of transport across the lymphatic endothelium, the relative contribution of each individual route is not clear. It appears, however, that both routes function simultaneously (Figure 8)  27  and the importance of each may vary in different regions of the body and under different physiological conditions. \n  IV. LYMPH FLOW  \n Lymph flow or circulation can be broken down into two stages. The first stage involves lymph absorption and flow at the lymphatic capillaries via the intercellular or vesicular route. The second stage involves propulsion of the lymph along the larger contractile collecting lymphatic vessels. \n  A. LYMPHATIC CAPILLARIES  \n Different theories have been proposed to describe lymph filling or flow into the lymphatic capillaries. At the lymphatic capillary level there is extensive overlapping of adjacent endothelial cell walls. In addition, numerous anchoring filaments (af) are attached to the abluminal cell wall, except for the inner segments of the overlapped junction (Figure 9).  46  This arrangement creates a flap valve (trap door) effect which is free to move in response to pressure changes. As the interstitial pressure increased above that in the lymphatic lumen, this applies tension on the anchoring filaments, which in turn pull on the attached portion of the lymphatic capillary wall allowing the unsupported portion of the cell wall (i.e., the flap) to swing open into the lumen [Figure 9 (b) and (c)]. In contrast, when the lymphatic capillary luminal pressure exceeds that of the interstitium, the flap is closed against the overlapping cell wall. 46  Therefore, the pressure differentials between the interstitium and the lymphatic capillary lumen play a vital role in lymph formation and flow. \n Casley-Smith  41,42,47  proposed an osmotic pull hypothesis to explain lymph flow through the lymphatic capillaries. This theory suggests that compression of the capillaries results in water expulsion out of the lymphatic capillaries into the interstitium through small pores impermeable to proteins. When the compressive force is released, the newly concentrated lymph exerts an osmotic force which draws fluid back into the capillaries via large pores. Considerable doubt has been cast on this theory due to recent studies which showed that protein concentration does not vary with vessel size  48  and that lymph protein concentration is the same as that in the tissue.  49  \n An alternative possibility, namely the suction theory, has been proposed.  19,50,51  In this case it is argued that an increased in the interstitial pressure will in turn cause the intraluminal lymphatic pressure to rise. If the pressure in the lymphatic capillaries is greater than in the adjacent lymphangion (i.e. the segment between two adjacent valves), then lymph will flow from the capillaries into the lymphagion. Once the pressure within the larger vessel reaches its threshold, an active contraction is initiated in the lymphangion which propels the lymph forward into the adjoining lymphangion. During recovery from the contraction, the pressure within the lymphangion becomes negative and thus draws in further lymph from the capillaries. Consequently, in a type of chain reaction, the pressure within the lumen of the lymphatic capillaries becomes negative with respect to the tissue pressure, thus creating a suction within the lumen which starts the filling cycle over again. \n  B. COLLECTING LYMPHATIC VESSELS  \n In the collecting/larger lymphatic vessels, the walls become progressively thicker due to the appearance of connective tissue and smooth muscle. The thickest walls reveal a trilaminar structure similar to that of blood vessels. The intima consists of endothelium and the media contains smooth muscle cells laid down in one or two concentric layers enabling the vessels to contract and thus propel the lymph upstream. The adventitia is made up of loose connective tissue containing collagen, elastin, and fibroblasts. Small blood vessels and adrenergic nerves which service the needs of the lymphatic wall have been found within the adventitia.  12  \n All of the collecting lymphatics have a generous supply of valves, which occur at regular intervals, to prevent the backflow of lymph. However, the number and size of intravalvular segments have not been clearly established as they tend to be related to the vessel size.  52  Large variations in the structure of these valves have been reported. Lauweryns  53  suggested a cone- or funnel-like design. Leak,  22  using scanning electron microscopy, found bicuspid valves along the lymphatics made up to two thin leaflets, the surfaces of which are lined with endothelial cells. 22,54  In the smaller lymphatic collecting vessels the valves consist only of endothelium. In the larger vessels, however, valves have several layers and contain elastic fibers. Tricuspid valves have also, on limited occasions, been reported.  19  \n The propulsion of lymph along the collecting lymphatic vessels is governed by a number of different extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Extrinsic factors include muscle contraction, respiratory movements, and movements of the intestine. It has been shown that lymph flow increases during exercise and muscular activity.  55,56  Running has been shown to increase lymph flow from the leg by approximately 150 to 300 <*> per cent sign </*> relative to the control.  57  Browse et al.  58  found that the pressure in the upper and lower ends of the dog thoracic duct was significantly influenced by respiration rhythm and Lee  59  showed that intestinal motility greatly influenced lymph flow from intestines. \n Although these extrinsic factors have a role, it is now considered that the intrinsic rhythmic contractions of the valved lymphatic vessels are primarily responsible for the propulsion of the lymph toward the thoracic duct. The strength and frequency of these intrinsic contractions have been related to the rate of lymph flow.  60  \n The intrinsic smooth muscle contractions of the lymphatic vessels are regulated by three major factors: (i) the transmural vessel distension, (ii) humoral mediators, and (iii) neural mediators.  19  The segment between two adjacent valves i.e., the lymphangion, contracts as a unit with the contraction being stimulated by radial distension. A contraction will only occur when the tension in the wall exceeds a certain threshold value, this value increasing with vessel size.  61  Each contraction lasts for a set period of time and is followed by a period of relaxation. The contractions begin in the lymphagions adjacent to the lymphatic capillaries and spread progressively through each lymphangion towards the thoracic duct. The contractile cycle of the lymphatic smooth muscle has not been extensively examined. However, it seems that there are two separate phases: (i) the diastolic phrase, during which the intervalvular segment is filling, and (ii) the systolic phase, during which the contraction develops.  62  \n Zweifach and Prather  63  performed a detailed study of collecting lymphatics of the mesentry of the cat and the omentum of the rabbit. The results showed that contraction begins in the smaller branches and spreads progressively to the larger vessels, this process taking 4 to 5 seconds. Between 10 and 18 contraction-relaxation cycles occurred per minute with each contraction cycle lasting on average 3 to 4 seconds. The amplitude of pulsations ranged from 2 to 4 cm H2O in the larger lymphatics and the intraluminal pressure increased gradually with vessel size.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "1cfa1388-a0b4-4e4f-b2c2-054d326adea0", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.587940+00:00"}
{"text": "<Galway Bay sole>\n\n\n<$A>\n<$B>\n  Introduction  \n The thickback sole  Microchirus variegatus  (Donovan, 1808) is a relatively small species of the sole family, found on sandy and muddy ground. While recorded as deep as 400m (Quero  et al.  1986), it is most abundant in depths between 37m and 92m (Wheeler 1969). Its distribution along the eastern Atlantic extends southward from north of the British Isles. It is also found in the Mediterranean and Adriatic, while its southern distribution is unknown (Quero  et al.  1986). Rae (1970) gives an account of its distribution in Scottish waters. \n Owing to its relative scarcity and small size, the thickback sole is of no economic importance, and hence very little is known about its general biology. Brief details on its rate of growth were given by Cunningham (1891-2), and Russell (1976) summarised the information available on the eggs and planktonic stages. Lebour (1918; 1920) gave an account of the four of the larval and young stages, whilst the feeding habits of the adults have been investigated by Stevens (1930), Sorbe (1972) and Quiniou (1978). \n Little is known of its biology in Irish waters. Went and Kennedy (1976) and Dunne and Konnecker (1976) noted its occurrence, whilst Fives (1970) gave the seasonal abundance and distribution of the larval stages in the plankton off the west coast of Ireland. The present study was undertaken in order to increase our knowledge of the biology of the thickback sole in the Galway Bay area. \n  Sampling methods  \n The fish were caught incidentally by commercial vessels fishing for prawns ( Nephrops norvegicus  L.) and/or whitefish on sandy ground off the north shore of Galway Bay in the vicinity of Spiddal, west coast of Ireland (53  degrees sign  10' N, 9  degrees sign  47' W). A 70-80mm (stretched) cod-end was used. The thickback sole were collected by hand from extensive heaps of  'trash fish' on board these vessels. Prior examination in the laboratory, the fish were preserved by deep-freezing at -18  degrees sign  C. \n  Laboratory methods \n (a)  Age and growth.   Each fish was sexed, measured to the nearest millimetre below, and weighed without surface drying to the nearest 0.1g. Both standard (s.l.) and total (t.l.) length measurements were taken. The sagittal otoliths were removed and read following burning over a low gas flame for 10-30 seconds (Christensen 1964). During this process, the overall colour of the otolith changed form white to yellow-brown to black and finally ash grey. When examined microscopically, a clear pattern of alternating white (opaque prior to burning) and black (transparent prior to burning) zones could be seen on the surfaces of the fractured otolith. Age was determined by counting the number of white zones (i.e. summers of life), on the assumption that a white and black zone are laid down annually. January 1 was taken as the official birth date (Williams and Bedford 1974). A von Bertalanffy growth curve was fitted to the age-length data for each sex. The latter may be described by the equation:\n<equation> </equation>\nwhere Lt <*> equals sign </*> length at time t, L <*> equals sign </*> maximum theoretical length, K <*> equals sign </*> growth constant and to <*> equals sign </*> theoretical age at zero length. These parameters were calculated with the aid of the Fortran BGC 2 program (Abramson 1971), which was modified to suit the data. \n (b)  Reproduction.    The gonads were removed and weighed (wet weight) to the nearest 0.1mg. Maturity was assessed according to an arbitrary system whereby five stages were recognised for each sex, i.e. I immature virgins, II maturing virgins or recovering spents, III ripening, IV rope, V spent. The seasonal changes in gonad development were followed by calculating the monthly gonosomatic index, where GSI = gonad wt/whole body wt x 100 (Htun Han 1978). Data from equivalent months from different years were combined. Fecundity of the thickback sole was estimated by counting the number of ripening and ripe oocytes in a weighed portion of the ovary. The total number of oocytes in both ovaries was then calculated. \n  (c) Food.    The gut was removed, weighed (wet weight) and its contents identified. The diet was assessed using three methods of analysis, defined as follows.\n (i) Percentage points  - Depending on the amount of food present, each gut was allotted 0-20 points. The number of points awarded to a food category was then expressed as a percentage of the total number of points allotted to the sample.\n (ii) Percentage occurrence  - The occurrence of individual food items was expressed as a percentage of the number of fish in the sample containing food.\n (iii) Percentage number  - The number of occurrences of a particular food category was expressed as a percentage of the total number of occurrences of all food items in the sample. \n  Results and discussion  \n  Age and growth \n A total of 512 thickback sole were collected between March 1978 and September 1979 in the Galway Bay area. Of this total 93 (18 <*> per cent sign </*> ) were male and 419 (82 <*> per cent sign </*> ) were female. The overwhelming predominance of females in the catches is attributed to the fact that the larger females were more frequently caught by the coarse meshes used. The study of thickback sole population growth and dynamics is thus limited in its overall observations. \n The largest fish recorded was a fourteen-year-old female measuring 15.5cm (17.4cm t.l.), while the oldest was a seventeen-year-old female measuring 13.5cm (15.8cm t.l.). The largest male was a twelve-year-old of 13.0cm (15.2cm t.l.). Fish of similar length have also been recorded for this area by Dunne and Konnecker (1976). However, fish ranging in size from 21.5-22.5cm have been recorded elsewhere (see Cunningham 1891-2 for the Plymouth area; Rae 1970 for Scottish waters; Holt and Byrne 1905 for British and Irish waters; and Quiniou 1978 for Douarnenez Bay on the west coast of Brittany). \n The length frequency distribution for (A) males and (B) females in the sampled population and in each age group (3 <*> plus sign </*>, 4 <*> plus sign </*>, 5 <*> plus sign </*> etc.) is given in Fig. 1.A considerable overlap in length with age exists, which confounds any attempt to separate age classes by length for this species. Subsequent examination of the otoliths by burning (Christensen 1964) showed that the largest size grouping included fish with ages ranging from 12 to 16 years for males and from 8 to 17 years for females. \n The otoliths of  M. variegatus  are typically sole-like in appearance. They are quite thick with a relatively rounded outline, plano-convex in section and, during the present investigation, ranged in size from 2.05-3.65mm. The otoliths were burned over a low flame; when the burned fractions were viewed under a dissecting microscope, alternating white and black zones could be clearly seen on the surface of the broken section of otolith. Figure 2 illustrates the seasonal variation in the percentage occurrence of a white or black zone at the otolith edge during the period of the investigation. Data from equivalent months from the two years have been combined. The zones were considered to be annular in formation. Maximum occurrence (95-100 <*> per cent sign </*>) of a white (opaque prior to burning) zone at the otolith edge, indicating a period of increased growth, was recorded between May and August, while black (transparent prior to burning) zones were correspondingly less frequent during this time. \n The mean length for each age group ( <*> plus minus sign </*> 95 <*> per cent sign </*> confidence limits) is given in Fig. 3, together with the fitted von Bertalanffy growth in length curves. In order to remove the effect of a sampling bias, fish less than age group 5 for females and age group 6 for males were not included when estimating the parameters . \n Growth is rapid for the first seven or eight years of life, after which it gradually slows down, with very little growth occurring after the tenth or eleventh year. Female fish are larger than males of the same age group. This difference, however, is not significant (p> 0.05). \n A considerably faster rate of growth for  M. variegatus  was recorded by Cunningham (1891-2) at Plymouth where the fish reached 15.2cm in their second year. Cunningham, however, looked at the surface of unbroken otoliths. During the present investigation it was found that because of the thickness of the otolith an accurate age for the fish could not be calculated merely by viewing the otolith as a whole under the microscope. A maximum of about five rings only could be seen using this method. This became more obvious in the case of the larger and older specimens. Only after burning the otoliths (Christensen 1964) and examining the broken fractures could the age of the fish be determined with accuracy. \n At Galway Bay females matured and spawned when they were three years old, having attained at least 9.0cm (s.l.) in length. Males, however, did not spawn until they had reached four years of age. The smallest ripe male recorded measured 8.2cm (s.l.). This difference in the age and length for first spawning is probably due to the slightly faster growth rate of the female specimens. \n Figure 4 illustrates the percentage age composition of the sampled population. Fish less than 7.0cm (s.l.) in length and three years of age were not recorded during the present investigation. As the larval and young stages do not appear to differ in bathymetric distribution from the adults (Holt and Byrne 1905), their absence is no doubt due to the sampling bias in favour of the larger fish. The 1975 year class was the youngest group sampled efficiently by the sampling gear and was by far the most abundant cohort recorded in the catches. There was a steady decline in the numbers of fish surviving with time (1962-74), with no major recruitment from year to year. This pattern seems to indicate a relatively steady mortality rate for the thickback sole in the Galway Bay area. \n  Reproduction  \n It was not always possible to sex the fish externally. During the breeding season, however, females were easily distinguishable from males by the presence of large orange/red ovaries, the ventral one of which could be seen through the pale underside of the body. Very few immature (stage I) fish were recorded during the sampling period. Stage II fish were noted throughout the year. Ripening (stage fish occurred between January and June, whilst ripe (stage IV) fish were recorded from March to August. Spent fish (stage V) appeared in the catches in May and reached peak occurrence in September, when the spawning season came to an end. \n The seasonal changes in gonad development during the study period were followed separately for both male and female fish, and the mean GSI values per month were calculated. Data from equivalent months for the two years were combined and the results are presented in Fig.5. The testes varied little in weight from month to month; however, a gradual increase in their weight was noted from March onwards. A slight peak was recorded in May, June and July when ripe males were abundant in the catches, while a decrease in value by August was indicative of an increase in the number of spent males. The female GSI values followed a similar pattern to that of the male fish. There was much more of an increase in GSI values for females from April to June. From the graph, peak numbers of ripe fish were recorded in June, July and August. A rapid decline in values from September onwards corresponded to an increase in the number of spent females. Information obtained from staging the fish is therefore substantiated by plotting GSI values, the results indicating a spawning period from May to August for  M. variegatus  in the Galway Bay area. \n An earlier spawning period for the thickback sole of April-May has been recorded by Russell (1976) for the English Channel and by Cunningham (1891-2) for fish in the Plymouth area. These fish, however, were captured at latitudes south of the Galway Bay area, where water temperatures are slightly higher (Anon. 1981), thus possibly explaining, at least in part, the difference in spawning times between the various locations.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "434ff5d7-7359-4efc-91ff-a9f013d2257f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.588965+00:00"}
{"text": "<Shearing lambs>\n\n\n<$A>\n<$B>\n Effects of Autumn Shearing of Spring-Born Ewe Lambs on Liveweight and Reproductive Performance \n  Introduction  \n Effective exploitation of the reproductive potential of ewe lambs can increase the overall efficiency of a sheep enterprise, particularly in self-contained flocks. However, the onset of puberty in spring-born ewe lambs is typically 6 to 8 weeks later than the onset of the breeding season in adult ewes (Dyrmundsson, 1973). As a result the lambing season in flocks consisting of both adults and ewe lambs may be very long unless the breeding of the adults is delayed. This is unlikely to be an option in most mid-season production systems. It has also been shown that conception rate and embryo survival are impaired in ewe lambs relative to adult ewes (Quirke and Hanrahan, 1977; Quirke, 1979; McMillan and McDonald, 1985). This increases the duration of the lambing season of ewe lambs with consequent inefficiencies in the use of feed and would also tend to increase the risk of perinatal infection under indoor lambing conditions. These difficulties would be minimised if the mating period of ewe lambs coincided with that for adult ewes. However, this would require advancement of the breeding season in ewe lambs. \n The breeding season of ewe lambs can be advanced and controlled by the use of hormone treatment based on progestagen plus pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin (PMSG), by the use of exogenous melatonin (Ronayne  et al.,  1991) or by exploiting the ram effect (Hanrahan and O'Riordan, 1989). There is also some evidence that the onset of puberty can be advanced by shearing    ewe   lambs prior to joining (Gordon 1967; Kemp, Leve and Berger, 1991) although Dyrmundsson and Lees (1972) reported that autumn shearing was actually associated with a slight delay in the date of first oestrus. O'Doherty and Crosby (1991) and Pickard and Johnson (1992) have reported that autumn shearing improved overall reproductive performance, including conception rate, of ewe lambs. \n The present experiment was designed to evaluate the effects of autumn shearing, under natural mating conditions, on mating date, ovulation rate, conception rate and embryo survival in March-born ewe lambs joined with rams on a date typical of that of adult ewes in mid-season production systems. The aim was to identify the components of the reproductive process responsible for any observed change in overall reproductive performance. The experiment was repeated in each of 3 consecutive years. \n  Materials and Methods  \n In September 1989 40 Suffolk x (Galway x Cambridge) ewe lambs, which had been born in a single flock in early March, were randomly assigned (13 September) to either shorn or unshorn treatments. The study was repeated in 1990, when 73 Cheviot-cross ewe lambs (sired by either Balclare or Suffolk rams and born in a single flock in late March) were assigned (21 September), within sire breed, to one of the two treatments. All the non-shorn ewe lambs had the crutch region clipped at the time of shearing to eliminate any possible effect of crutch wool on mating efficiency. Ewe lambs had been kept in isolation from males from weaning in July. Ferile, harnessed Texel rams were joined with the ewe lambs in 1989 and both shorn and unshorn lambs were managed together as one flock on a 3 ha unit throughout the study. In the second and third years, management was similar but Suffolk rams were used. \n In all years the rams were joined on 16 October and removed in early December (5 to 7). Matings were recorded daily and within 10 days of the first recorded mating each ewe lamb was examined by laparascopy to determine ovulation rate. Ovulation rate was not determined after repeat matings. Ewe lambs which had not been mated by the end of the joining period were examined, by laparoscopy, immediately after ram removal to determine reproductive status. \n Following ram removal the ewes were housed in a slatted shed and offered double-chop silage  ad libitum  plus a concentrate supplement (299g/day of a proprietary pelleted feed containing 160g crude protein per kg dry matter). In late January, pregnancy status and number of foetuses were determined by ultrasonic scanning after which ewes with twins were grouped separately from those with singles. Starting at about 8 weeks pre-lambing, the amount of supplement was increased gradually to a maximum of 400g and 600g/day for ewe lambs carrying singles and twins, respectively. \n All animals were weighed before shearing in September (pre-shearing weight), and were weighed again prior to joining in October (pre-mating), at housing in December (post-mating) and in late January or early February (mid-pregnancy). In the case of shorn animals, the fleece weight was added to all subsequent liveweights to facilitate direct group comparisons. Lambing took place indoors under close supervision and lambs were weighed within 24 h of birth. Conception date and rate were verified by reconciliation of dates for mating with observed lambing date. \n Data for all traits, except proportion mated and conception rate, were analysed by least squares procedures (Harvey, 1990) using a model which fitted shearing treatment and year-breed combination and their interaction. All animals joined with the ram were used in the analyses of liveweight. The analyses of date of mating (first service) excluded any individuals which were unmated or had failed to ovulate. Lambing date and birth weight were analysed using a model which included effects for shearing treatment, year-breed and litter size. Data relating to proportion mated, conception rate and the distribution of date of first mating were analysed by maximum likelihood procedures for categorical data using the CATMOD procedure (SAS,1988). \n  Results  \n  Ewe liveweight  \n The effects of shearing and year-breed combination on liveweight are shown in Table 1. Shearing had no significant effect on liveweight at any stage to mid-pregnancy. However, when liveweights recorded after shearing were analysed, using pre-shearing liveweight as a covariate, the shorn ewes were significantly lighter at the pre-mating stage (about 4 weeks after shearing) but were significantly heavier at mid-pregnancy. The effect of shearing on mid-pregnancy weight was largely attributable to an effect in year 3 and this was reflected in a significant interaction component. Shearing had no significant effect on liveweight gain over the period from shearing to post-mating. Differences between years were significant and, within the second year, Suffolk-x ewe lambs were heavier than the Belclare-x ewe lambs. There was no evidence of any interaction between shearing treatment and either year or breed for any of the liveweight traits or for liveweight adjusted for pre-shearing weight except at mid-pregnancy, as noted above. \n  Reproductive performance  \n Information on reproductive performance is summarised in Tables 2 and 3. Only eight of the 166 lambs joined failed to mate and 78 <*> per cent sign </*> of those mated produced lambs. Six of the unmated lambs had corpora lutea when examined at the end of the joining period. Of the 158 lambs mated, two did not have a corpus luteum at the post-mating laparoscopy. Thus 156 lambs had a date of first service which was accompanied by ovulation. Thirty-three of these animals did not lamb. Shearing treatment had no effect on proportion mated or on overall conception rate and these traits were unaffected by year. There was no evidence for any interaction of shearing treatment with either year or breed. Conception rate to first service was not affected by year or shearing treatment. However, the year-x-shearing interaction was significant (P <*> less than sign </*> 0.05). In the first year the conception rate was higher for the shorn lambs (72 <*> per cent sign </*> v. 43 <*> per cent sign </*> ) but the opposite pattern occurred in the second year (53 <*> per cent sign </*> v. 68 <*> per cent sign </*> ). There was little difference due to shearing in the third year (50 <*> per cent sign </*> v. 52 <*> per cent sign </*> . Conception rate to first service was affected by ewe breed (second year) with Belclare crosses having a lower conception rate than Suffolk crosses (P <*> is less than sign </*> 0.05). This was also reflected in overall conception rates. \n There was no evidence for any effect of shearing treatment on the proportion of ewes mated within 14 days of joining (P <*> less than sign </*> 0.5) but this trait varied significantly among years (P <*> less than sign </*> 0.01), being lowest in the second year. Likewise, when date of first service was analysed directly, shearing had no effect and there was no evidence for any breed (second year) or shearing-x-breed interaction effects. Ovulation rate at first service was not significantly affected by autumn shearing and there was no year-x-shearing interaction. However, there was evidence for a breed-x-shearing interaction effect in the second year (P <*> equals sign </*> 0.05) when shorn Belclare crosses had a higher ovulation rate than their unshorn counterparts while the reverse pattern occurred in the Suffolk crosses. \n The reproductive performance of the ewes which lambed is summarised in Table 4. Ovulation rate, number of services to conception, conception date, lambing date and litter size were all unaffected by shearing. The number of services to conception was not affected by year or breed. Year had a significant (P <*> less than sign </*> 0.05) effect on conception date due essentially to the later date in the second year. While this may be attributable to some extent to the later date for the Belclare crosses, the breed difference was only 4 days and was not significant. It was due to both a slightly later date of first mating and a higher number of repeats. Earliest conception date was seen in the third year although the number of services per conception was also highest in that year. Ovulation rate varied among years and while the F-test for years was not significant (P <*> equals sign </*> 0.17) the mean test for 1991 was significantly greater than that for 1990 (P <*> less than sign </*> 0.05). The pattern of effects on lambing date was similar to that for conception date. \n Litter size was not significantly affected by shearing treatment. Year had no effect on litter size and the interactions breed-x-shearing and year-x-shearing were not significant. Shearing did not influence gestation length. \n The effects of September shearing on lamb birth weight are summarised in Table 5. While shorn ewes gave birth to heavier lambs the differences were not significant for either birth-type category or overall. There was no evidence for a year-x-shearing interaction but in the second year Belclare crosses gave birth to heavier (P <*> less than sign </*> 0.05) lambs than Suffolk crosses. Mean birth weight in the third year was higher (P <*> less than sign </*> 0.01) than for the 2 previous years. \n  Discussion  \n Autumn shearing was found to have a significant short-term effect on liveweight gain but this effect was relatively small and had disappeared by early December (post-mating). In contrast, Salman and Owen (1981) found that September-shorn lambs, offered a pelleted diet while confined outdoors for a 46-day period, had a higher growth rate than unshorn contemporaries but also consumed significantly more food. In the present study herbage supply was considered to be average, with sward heights of 6 to 9 cm (Grennan, 1989), and this is supported by the fact that liveweight increased substantially between September and the end of joining. The lower liveweight gain in the shorn group for the immediate post-shearing period is probably indicative of an inability of this group to increase herbage intake sufficiently to counter-balance the likely increased heat loss associated with shearing. \n Shearing had no effect on the date of first service which is consistent with the results of Drymundsson and Lees (1972), who used Clun Forest ewe lambs. In fact, in both studies there was a slight delay in date of first service in shorn animals. Similarly, McMillan and Knight (1982) reported that shearing significantly reduced the proportion of 2-tooth ewes mated during the first 14 days of the joining period, even where joining date was in advance of normal onset of the breeding season. Thus ewe lambs or 2-tooth ewes mated during the first 14 days of the joining period, even where joining date was in advance of normal onset of the breeding season. Thus ewe lambs or 2-tooth ewes do not appear to respond to shearing in the same manner as adult ewes (Lees, 1967). This may be attributable to stress associated with increased heat loss during the early post-shearing period. \n The proportions of ewes mated and lambing in the present study were unaffected by autumn shearing. Likewise shearing had no effect on overall conception rate. However, while there was no effect of shearing on conception rate to first service there was a significant interaction for this trait between year and shearing treatment due to opposite effects of shearing between the first 2 years. These results differ in certain respects from those of previous authors. Thus, Gordon (1967) found evidence that shearing increased the proportion mated with only a minor effect on conception rate. However the proportion lambing relative to those joined was only 10 percentage points higher for shorn ewe lambs. An analysis of the results given by Gordon (1967) shows that this difference was not significant (x  squared  <*> equals sign </*> 1.62) while the effect on proportion mated approached significance (x  squared  <*> equals sign </*> 3.69). Pickard and Johnson (1992) found that the proportion of ewe lambs which lambed was significantly increased by shearing 1 month prior to joining (89 <*> per cent sign </*> v. 73 <*> per cent sign </*>). O'Doherty and Crosby (1991), in a study involving synchronisation of mating using PMSG and progestogen sponges, also found that shearing significantly increased the proportion of ewe lambs which lambed to a synchronised oestrus. The proportion which lambed to all services was also increased. Some or all of these increases may be attributable to more effective mating of the shorn ewe lambs as it has been shown that 25 to 30 <*> per cent sign </*> of ewe lambs which had been marked by rams were not in fact inseminated (Allison  et al.,  1975). In the present study the unshorn ewe lambs had wool clipped from around the crutch region prior to joining and this may have facilitated effective mating. In a study in New Zealand, using 2-tooth ewes, McMillan and Knight (1982) reported that shearing increased both the proportion which lambed to first service and the overall proportion which lambed following a 6-week joining period. \n While litter size was not significantly affected by shearing, in agreement with the observations of O'Doherty and Crosby (1991) and Pickard and Johnson (1992), the shorn ewes had a litter size which was 0.13 higher than for their unshorn counterparts (Table 4). Contrasting results have been reported for the effects of shearing on the prolificacy of 2-tooth ewes by McMillan and Knight (1982) who reported that shearing significantly reduced ovulation rate and litter size. In order to further examine the components of the difference in litter size observed in the present study, data for the set of ewes which lambed to first service (n <*> equals sign </*> 89), and therefore with information on the associated ovulation rate, were examined separately. The results are summarised in Table 6 and show that differences in litter size essentially reflected differences in ovulation rate and there was no evidence for any effect of shearing on embryo survival. This conclusion is based on the fact that the observed difference in litter size is equal to that predicted from ovulation rate, based on a common embryo survival pattern (Hanrahan, 1982), and is consistent with the absence of an effect of shearing on conception rate (Table 2). The observed mean litter size for all ewes in this set was significantly lower (0.10 <*> plus or minus sign </*> 0.049, P <*> is less than sign </*> 0.05) than that predicted from mean ovulation rate. This reflects the fact that the proportion of corpora lutea represented by lambs in the twin ovulating ewes in this set was 0.7, which is lower than the values for embryo survival typically observed in twin-ovulating adult ewes (Hanrahan, 1986) but higher than the survival rates observed by ewe lambs by Quirke (1979) and Quirke and Hanrahan (1977).", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "1ba7f49e-9b02-4a38-b04c-63e79cd31504", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.589843+00:00"}
{"text": "<Lowland blanket bog>\n\n\n<$A>\n  ORIGINS OF IRISH LOWLAND BLANKET BOG  \n  M. O'Connell  \n  Department of Botany, University College Galway  \n  ABSTRACT  \n Lowland or Atlantic blanket bog is largely confined to the western seaboard counties of Ireland, where its eastern limit closely coincides with the 1200mm isohyet and number of rain days per annum exceeding 200. The underlying solid geology consists of base-poor metamorphic, sedimentary and igneous rock types. These rock types also provide the parent material for the drifts which, in parts, are patchy or absent. This combination of factors results in edaphic conditions favourable to podzolization and bog growth. \n Within the region occupied by blanket bog, minerotrophic peat began to accumulate in small basins early in the post-glacial. Succession to ombrotrophic peat was effected at some sites in the Atlantic period, but blanket bog, as a dominant feature in the landscape, is essentially a phenomenon of the later post-glacial. While climatic factors and time-dependent pedogenic processes form the background against which the spread of blanket bog took place, it is argued that human impact played a major role in its widescale expansion in the second and first millennia B.C. \n  INTRODUCTION  \n Blanket bog constitutes the main landscape feature and the only remaining extensive unit of natural vegetation in the western seaboard counties of Kerry, south-west Clare, Galway, Mayo and Donegal, and in upland regions with elevation exceeding 200m (cf. Fig. 1). Some 10 <*> per cent sign </*> of the total land surface of the country, or almost 900,000ha, is covered by blanket bog, 37 <*> per cent sign </*> of which is classified as lowland or Atlantic blanket bog, not only on the basis of relief but also in recognition of its distinctive floristic composition (Hammond 1979; Doyle 1982; 1990).\n While the main purpose of this paper is to provide a chronological framework and to reconstruct the factors that may have led to blanket bog growth in the lowlands, the origins of upland blanket bog are also considered, particularly since research by others provides information relevant to the better evaluation of the lowland data. \n\n A substantial body of data on blanket bog initiation derives from research carred out in Northern Ireland in the Palaeoeocology Laboratory, Queen 's University, during the 1960s. In this region, it is not so much location  vis-\\a-vis  the rain-bearing westerlies but rather an upland relief in the form of the Sperrin mountains in mid-Ulster and the Antrim Plateau that results in a precipitation/evaporation regime favourable to blanket bog growth (Cruickshank 1970). Smith (1975), reviewing the radiocarbon and palaeoenvironmental evidence for blanket bog initiation, shows that a wide time-span is involved and that, apparently, altitude is not an important factor. The dates from the Sperrin uplands centring on 4000 B.P. are, however, older than those from the Antrim Plateau, where most of the dates lie within the range 3700 to 3300 B.P. (all dates in uncorrected years B.P.)\n In County Donegal, the initiation of lowland blanket peat probably dates to the earlier fourth millennium B.P. Investigations by Telford (1977) in the Glenveagh National park indicate that peat growth was underway by 4000 B.P. (pine stumps dating to 3850 <*> plus or minus sign </*> 100 and 3880 <*> plus or minus sign </*> 110 (Birm-845, -844)), though in a pollen profile from Lough Nadourcon, in the same area, the transition to blanket peat does not take place until c. 2500 B.P.\n In evaluating the data from Northern Ireland, Smith (1975) recognizes the possible role of deteriorating climate in bog initiation. At the same time, he emphasizes the coincidence of bog initiation and the advent of cultures with a knowledge of metallurgy, and also the pollen analytical evidence for a general opening-up of woodland from early Bronze Age times, over and above that which took place in the preceding Neolithic. The possible key role of Townland, County Antrim, where depth of cultivation in the soil during the later Neolithic is regarded as determining the position at which iron pan formation occurred (Proudfoot 1958). This, and the subsequent formation of an impervious humus layer, are regarded as the main factors leading to blanket bog formation (Case  et al. 1969; Mitchell 1972). \n In north County Mayo, where some of the most extensive tracts of low-land blanket bog occur, investigation of early field systems preserved beneath the bog has provided pertinent information on the timing of lowland blanket bog formation. In the Behy/Glenulra area, a reliable  terminus post quem  for the formation of blanket bog over a wide area is provided by stone wall enclosures extending over c. 1000ha that have been recorded beneath the bog (Caulfield 1978; 1983; Lynch  et al. 1987). As far as can be ascertained by probing through the often deep overlay of peat, the stone walls of this enclosure system lie directly on mineral ground. Caulfield (1987; 1983) has shown, on the basis of both 14C and archaeological evidence, that the walls were laid out in the Neolithic, i.e. during the fifth millennium B.P. The 14C evidence points to widespread blanket bog in the early fourth millennium B.P. (cf. Smith  et al. 1973). Two summary pollen diagrams have been published by Moore (1979), but, unfortunately, these are not 14C-dated. The earliest Landnam may be represented in Moore 's Behy II profile, which would suggest a pre-Neolithic age for the basal peat. Macrofossil and pollen evidence suggest that the basal peat, while containing fossil remains of blanket bog plants such as  Sphagnum  and  Potentilla erecta , may only represent the precursor of blanket bog.  Juncus  seeds, for instance, are frequent in the basal 50cm. More detailed investigations to determine the age and the nature of the basal peats in this area are obviously desirable. \n At Belderg, 7km to the west, a more complex pattern of blanket bog initiation is recorded. The main enclosure system situated on the leeward side of a gently sloping hillside was laid out in the Neolithic (Caulfield 1978), when peat growth had not yet commenced, at least in the area with stone walls. Radiocarbon dates of 4220 <*> plus or minus sign </*> 95 for pine with lateral roots overlying mineral ground and 3835 <*> plus or minus sign </*> 85 B.P. for oak growing in peat suggest that at the end of the fifth millennium bog was present in the area. Part of the enclosure remained free of peat or, at most, had only a thin covering until after an occupation phrase of late Bronze Age date (3200 B.P.; Caulfield 1978). This suggests that human activity, which is often implicated in bog initiation, may in some circumstances inhibit peat growth. In this connection, it is of interest that some of the latest dates for bog growth in the Sperrin uplands are those from the archaeological site at Beaghmore, County Tyrone (195m O.D.), where, though heath taxa were prominent in the pollen record from 3800 B.P. onwards (Pilcher 1969, diagram 1), local blanket bog initiation begins no earlier than 2700 B.P. (cf. also Cashelkeelty, county Kerry, Lynch 1981). \n There is evidence to suggest that immediately to the west of Belderg blanket bog formation dates to the Atlantic period. Near Bellanaboy Bridge, to the west of Glenamoy, wood from a pine root growing in the mineral soil beneath peat gave a date of 7110 <*> plus or minus sign </*> B.P., while another stump from the same areas, but with roots c. 20cm above the mineral soil, yielded the date 4340 <*> plus or minus sign </*> 65 B.P. (Hakansson 1974). This, and the lack of evidence for pre-bog settlement in an extensive area about Glenamoy (Fig. 2), prompted Caulfield (1983) to suggest that blanket bog was already widespread here at the beginning of the Neolithic. \n At Carrownaglogh, situated at 150m O.D. on the lower western slopes of the Ox Mountains, peat accumulation commenced in a shallow basin at or shortly after 4000 B.P. (O'Connell 1986). Lateral extension was slow, so that it was not until 3200 B.P. that peat began to accumulate near the base of the knoll (Location 5 in O'Connell 1986). Over 500 years later, blanket bog began to envelop the knoll. Here the mineral soil, which had been formed into cultivation ridges, showed strong iron pan development. Tillage, carried on to the point of soil exhaustion, and the subsequent abandonment of the site are envisaged as the factors giving rise to iron pan formation which in turn led to waterlogging, humus accumulation and bog growth (O'Connell 1986). \n In south-west Ireland, the data of Jessen (1949) relating to blanket bog initiation have been augmented by investigations of Lynch (1981) into the palaeoenvironment of stone alignments and circles of the south Kerry/south-west Cork region (cf. Cashelkeelty, Fig. 1). These investigations confirm the relatively late date for widespread blanket bog initiation suggested by Jessen 's data. The 14C dates from the basal peat at the archaeological sites span a wide range, from 3260 <*> plus or minus sign </*> 55 B.P. at Maughansilly, south-west Cork (213m O.D.) to early first millennium B.P. dates at other sites. The pollen content of the buried mineral soils shows, however, that heath vegetation, and possibly bog, were present and that regional podzolization was taking place from early in the fourth millennium B.P. Pollen analytical investigations by Welten (1952), at altitudes of 270m and higher on Carrauntoohil (1041m), County Kerry, show blanket bog initiation taking place quite late in the sub-Atlantic, though Hakansson (1974) gives a date of 4600 <*> plus or minus sign </*> 65 B.P. for a pine stump in basal peat from an altitude of 250m. The overall lateness of the dates for bog expansion from south-west Ireland is surprising in view of rainfall in excess of 1600mm per annum, the high altitude, and the long history of agriculture, which at Cashelkeelty extended back to the earliest Neolithic. These results, together with those reviewed earlier, serve to emphasize the difficulties in deciphering a pattern and establishing the causes of blanket bog growth. \n The results of investigations which allow reconstruction of the environmental conditions and timing of blanket bog growth in Connemara, County Galway, are now considered. \n  PALAEOECOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS INTO BLANKET BOG GROWTH AT CONNEMARA NATIONAL PARK, LETTERFRACK, NORTH-WEST CONNEMARA  \n The sites chosen for investigation lie to the south-east of the Park Centre (grid ref. L 7157) where blanket bog, now much cut over, dominates the treeless landscape (Fig. 3). \n The deepest peats are recorded in a basin bounded to the south by the Owengarve River and its tributary, the Sruffaunnanoon, and to the north by elevated ground that rises stepply at the north-eastern side. A feature of this basin peat is an extensive intercalated layer of pine stumps. At the location of the main profile (FRKII), this pine stump layer rested on 2.4m of peat and was overlain by a layer 1.2m thick. Pollen analysis and radiocarbon dating showed that the profile spanned most of the post-glacial (Bowler 1986). An account of the woodland history is published in O'Connell  et al.  (1988). Here the history of mire development at the sampling site will be considered in the light of the pollen analytical results (Fig.4), supplemented by macro-fossil analysis carried out at selected levels (Heijnis 1987), a summary of which is provided in Fig. 5. \n The macro- and microfossil analyses indicate that, though terrestrial peat as distinct from limnic deposits began to accumulate in the pre-Boreal (zone IV, local posslen assemblage zones FRKII-1 (this pollen analytical zone is omitted in Figs 4 and 5) and FRKII-2, it was not until the mid-Atlantic period (post 6000 B.P., FRKII-7), that a mire vegetation with at least some floristic affinities to present-day blanket bog communities was established locally. Macrofossil analysis has not been carried out on the peat relating to the lower part of FRKII-7, but the pollen evidence indicates that grasses (probably  Molinia  ),  Narthecium , sedges,  Calluna  and  Potentilla  (most likely  P. erecta ) were frequent on the mire surface. Remains of the rhizopod  Assulina  are frequent at these levels, indicating that wet habitat conditions prevailed (Grospietsch 1972).\n\n Across the elm declin (FRKII-7/8 boundary), Gramineae values decrease from 42 <*> per cent sign </*> to 8 <*> per cent sign </*>,  Sphagnum  sect.  acutifolia  leaves are frequent, and  Sphagnum  spores are well represented. This suggests that the grass component of the mire vegetation declined while  Sphagnum  expanded.  Assulina  is now rare so that a drying out of the bog surface may have occurred, but this cannot have been severe as  Narthecium  continues to be well represented for some time. In the middle of FRKII-8, centres on 4000 B.P., a pine woodland became established on the mire surface. In this woodland, heathers  (Erica tetralix  and also  Calluna)  were important in the ground layer. As  Pinus  representation begins to decline,  Sphagnum  sect.  acutifolia  leaves are again recorded, suggesting that  Sphagnum  growth contributed to the demise of the bog woodland.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c16bc6dc-bb73-4a06-850e-0857f973ee75", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.590957+00:00"}
{"text": "<Bovine reproduction>\n\n\n<$A>\n  Puberty  \n Puberty, the process by which animals become capable of producing offspring, is often given a very restricted definition. According to Short (1984),  'we generally refer to puberty as that moment at which the female first comes into oestrus and ovulates, or the male first produces spermatozoa in his ejaculate'.  The trouble with this widely-held perception of puberty is that it concentrates exclusively on the apparent endpoint of a protracted and complex physiological process and suggests that puberty is a discrete event that can be assigned to a particular day (or moment!). There is the additional problem that the apparent end-point (first release of the gametes) is not necessarily conclusive evidence that the animal has now reached the stage at which it can reproduce itself; for instance, it is clear that many heifers may not be capable of doing so until well after first ovulation (see review by Moran  et al., 1989). \n In fact, the onset of puberty is a gradual process that is in train for several months during which there are significant morphological, physiological and behavioural responses to the progressive expression of both the steroidogenic and gametogenic activities of the gonads. The essential feature of the process is the maturation of the brain-hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, which culminates in the adult pattern of reproductive activity. The components of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis are present before birth and, even at that stage, each component is capable of responding to appropriate hormonal signals. During gestation, steroid hormones released from the placenta have an inhibitory effect on the fetal hypothalamus that suppresses the activities of the axis. After birth the axis becomes an independent regulatory system that secretes increased amounts of gonadotrophins and gonadal steroids. However, the system is restricted to a relatively low level of activity (juvenile level); for instance, in the female the level of activity is well below that required for ovulation or cyclic ovarian activity. The restraint is due partly to the fine sensitivity of the GnRH pulse generator to negative feedback by gonadal steroids and partly to inhibitory inputs from the neural circuits that control the hypothalamus. \n The transition to sexual maturity is brought about by progressive changes in the neuroendocrine activities of the axis in response to a variety of internal and environmental factors. The 'gonadostat' hypothesis postulates that the essential change during the transition to sexual maturity is a progressive decrease in sensitivity of the hypothalamus to the negative feedback effects of gonadal steroids (Fig. 30.13) so that the frequency of GnRH pulses is increased progressively. This leads to an increase in the sensitivity of the pituitary gonadotropes to GnRH and to an increase in the responsiveness of the gonads to the gonadotrophins (Fig. 30.14). Greater quantities of gonadotrophins are released from the pituitary gland and, in turn, greater quantities of steroids are released by the gonads. For instance, in the female the sensitivity of the hypothalamus to the negative feedback effect of oestrogen declines progressively and, as it does so, the increasing quantities of oestrogen from the ovaries can no longer hold the axis within the juvenile pattern of activity. There is a gradual movement of the regulatory system towards the adult pattern (Figs 30.13 and 30.14). Eventually, the ovaries produce a surge of oestrogen that exerts a positive feedback effect on the surge generator in the hypothalamus (Fig. 30.14) and this induces a surge of LH that leads to ovulation. \n As our knowledge of these changes expands, there is increasing evidence that sexual maturity is regulated to a considerable extent by changing patterns of neural control over the hypothalamus. These alterations in intrinsic neural activity do not appear to be dependent on gonadal hormones; however, they play a crucial role in that they gradually release the GnRH pulse generator from the restraints exercised by the central nervous system during the juvenile period, thus enabling it to respond to the gonadal steroids in the adult manner. It is evident that the classical 'gonodostat' hypothesis does not furnish an entirely satisfactory explanation of the onset of puberty in all its details. Nevertheless, it does provide a conceptual framework that is adequate for the purposes of this text. \n The first ovulation is likely to be silent; it appears that the hormonal requirements for the expression of oestrus are small quantities of progesterone from a regressing corpus luteum followed by a surge of oestrogen from the preovulatory follicle - a sequence that is absent at the time of first ovulation. Thus, the first oestrus observed by the stockperson indicated that the process of puberty is well advanced but it does not provide a precise date for the 'moment' of puberty. \n The earliest possible maturation of the individual components of the reproductive axis (and, therefore, of the axis itself) is determined by genes, i.e. there are inherent breed variations in the onset of puberty. However, in all breeds this process is subject to delays caused by a variety of endogenous and exogenous influences, some of which can be manipulated by the stockperson to ensure that the heifer is ready for breeding at the desired time. The principal environmental factors that influence the onset of puberty are: season of birth, level of nutrition, growth rate, photoperiod, high ambient temperatures, intercurrent diseases, and presence of the male. \n Specific reference to these factors will be made in the clinical segment of the text. For the moment, suffice it to say that, as a general guideline, the stockperson should devise a management strategy in the knowledge that the onset of puberty is a labile process that is conditioned by competition between the reproductive system and the other body systems of the growing animal for energy and specific nutrients. Reproduction, particularly in the female where it involves pregnancy followed by lactation, is an energy-consuming process to which Nature assigns a relatively low priority for the prepubertal animal. Evidence is accumulating from work on a number of species that inadequate intake of energy or nutrients can depress or abolish the activities of the GnRH pulse generator in the juvenile animal. This has been attributed, variously, to deficiencies in body weight, in rate of growth, in fat content or in fat:lean ratio. There is no agreement on the particular cue(s) that inhibit(s) the pulse generator but there is general acceptance of the thesis that the function of the generator is closely coupled with energy balance and that it is allowed to progress from the juvenile to the adult level of activity in the female only when the energetic status appears to be adequate to sustain pregnancy and lactation. \n Selective culling is an integral part of efficient management of the dairy herd. It can be practised successfully only when the stockperson has available an adequate number of high-quality heifers due to calve down at the appropriate time. This requires careful management of the prepubertal animal to ensure that the reactivation of the hypothalamic pulse generator is not delayed unduly by environmental influences, principally nutritional factors and subclinical diseases. \n Similarly, young bulls intended for breeding purposes require careful management during the juvenile period because the onset of puberty in the male is also influenced by a variety of factors (including breed, season of birth, energy intake and liveweight gain) that affect the reactivation of the hypothalamic GnRH pulse generator. \n  Male physiology  \n In the male, puberty is associated with changes in the pattern of LH secretion, a gradual increase in the concentration of testosterone in the blood, rapid growth of the testes and the initiation of spermatogenesis. In essence, the adult pattern of GnRH release is attained and the testes proceed to fulfil two primary functions: the synthesis and release of androgens ( steriodogenesis ) and the production of spermatozoa (  gametogenesis  ). In most male mammals, these functions are performed best at temperatures somewhat lower than body core temperature. \n In the bull the testes are located in the pendulous scrotum, where they are attuned to function at 3-4  <*> degrees centigrade sign </*>  below core temperature. The three principal mechanisms by which the scrotal temperature is reduced are as follows. 1 Precooling of the arterial blood supply as it passes through the vascular cone in the spermatic cord. The vascular cone consists of a coiled segment of the spermatic artery that is surrounded by the pampiniform plexus of the spermatic vein. Because of this anatomical arrangement the arterial blood and the venous blood are flowing in parallel but in opposite directions; this allows for an efficient countercurrent exchange of heat between the two vessels. The net result is that the arterial blood delivered to the testes is several degrees below body core temperature. 2 Sweating from the many sweat glands in the scrotal skin. 3 Physical contact with cold ground or other cold objects. \n In very cold weather, the temperature at the base of the scrotum may be up to 7  <*> degrees centigrade </*>  below core values but the bull can attempt to curtail the drop in temperature by drawing the scrotum closer to the (relatively) warm body wall by contracting the cremaster and dartos muscles. \n The gametogenic function of the testes is much more heat sensitive that the steroidogenic function; for instance, a retained testicle in a cryptorchid animal ('rig') may secrete androgens but the seminiferous tubules will remain infantile in structure and they will not produce spermatozoa. The retained testicle has a propensity to develop neoplasms. \n  Morphology of the testis  \n The testis is surrounded by a thick fibrous capsule, the tunica albuginea, form which septa project inwards to divide the substance of the testes into lobules (Fig. 30.15). Each lobule contains one to four highly convoluted seminiferous tubules and interstitial tissue that fills the spaces between the convolutions. \n The interstitial tissue contains blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, nerves and the steroid-secreting Leydig cells. \n The seminiferous tubules are about 200 pm in diameter and they may be up to 70 cm long; they open at both ends into the rete testis (Fig. 30.15). The tubules contain two populations of cells: (i) a fixed population of non-proliferating somatic cells, the Sertoli cells, and (ii) a migratory population of proliferating, differentiating germ cells (Fig. 30.16). \n SERTOLI CELLS \n The Sertoli cells have been described as the 'backbone' of the tubule. They are columnar cells that rest on the basement membrane and extend the full depth of the epithelial layer; they envelop the developing germ cells in deep recesses in their lateral walls and, ultimately, in their luminal surfaces. The Sertoli cells continually alter shape to accommodate the morphological changes in the germ cells during their migration from the base to the luminal surface. The plasma membranes of adjacent Sertoli cells form specialized interepithelial tight junctions that extend entirely around the circumference of each cell (Fig. 30.17). These junctions constitute the epithelial component of the blood-testis barrier that precludes the passage of many substances form the blood or interstitial fluid into the lumen of the seminiferous tubule. They also divide the intercellular spaces into two compartments: the basal compartment that contains the undifferentiated germ cells and the adluminal compartment that provides the appropriate microenvironment of the more differentiated germ cells (see below). \n The basal surface of the Sertoli cell has specific receptors for FSH. The cells respond to the gonadotrophin by secreting (i) a nutrient fluid that sustains the germ cells in the intercellular spaces, (ii) androgen-binding protein that binds and transports testosterone to the epididymis, and (iii) inhibin that modulates the secretion of FSH by negative feedback at the pituitary gland (Fig. 30.18). Sertoli cells also have receptors for androgens; it is known that testosterone can maintain the functional integrity of the Sertoli cell when FSH is withdrawn. \n Sertoli cells are resistant to relatively high levels of heat, ionizing radiation and many toxins, e.g. cadmium, nitrofurans, cytotoxins, that destroy differentiating germ cells. \n GERM CELLS \n A detailed description of the process of spermatogenesis (see Table 30.1) is beyond the scope of this text. Suffice it to say that the spermatogonia are the stem cells and that they begin the process by undergoing a number of mitotic divisions in the basal compartment. These divisions produce a pool of cells that are joined to each other by intercellular bridges (Fig. 30.19).", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "55a8fbba-0e67-402f-94e6-8649d6caa2aa", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.592141+00:00"}

P., \"Software Applications in Electrical Engineering\", Montreal: McGill University, 1993.  \n V.F. Fusco \n  Microwave Research Group, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The Queen 's University of Belfast, Belfast, BT9 5AH, UK  \n ABSTRACT \n In modern high frequency electronic design there is often a requirement for interactive CAE tools. The result of the ever increasing demands placed on these tools is that the cpu time required for circuit analysis is often prohibitively long. This paper presents a review of some of the methodologies involving parallel computing techniques that are employed for the solution of CPU intensive high frequency electromagnetic field and circuit problems. The limitations and advantages of these techniques are discussed. \n INTRODUCTION \n In modern high frequency electronic circuit design problems there is often a requirement for interactive CAE tools. This is increasingly important as circuit functionality or technological implementation becomes more complex. This is particularly true for monolithic microwave integrated circuit, MMIC, design, where the complex parasitic interaction between components has a first order effect on the quantitative prediction of circuit behaviour by computer simulation. The result of the increased demands placed on CAE software by such applications is such that the cpu time required for circuit analysis is often prohibitively long. One way of overcoming this problem is to reduce the total elapsed simulation time by partitioning the computational load through the combined use of CPU efficient concurrent computing algorithms and multiprocessor hardware. This paper presents a review of the application potential that exists for concurrent processing for the solution of typical design problems that are encountered at RF and microwave frequencies. \n For example many problems in the area of electromagnetics can be considered as follows: i.a pre-processing stage; where the problem geometry is defined ii. a matrix fill stage; here the mathematical relationships governing individual matrix elements are computed iii. a solve stage; where the primary field elements of interest are computed iv. a postprocessing stage; where secondary field parameters are generated and presentation of data occurs. \n As the requirement for more detail in the computer simulation, for example in monolithic microwave integrated circuit design [l] becomes more important or as circuit complexity increases then it is essential that more than one analysis per design be carried out. This is important so that non-recurrent engineering costs at the design phase be reduced. For example in a finite element formulation when performing an analysis, a small change made to an initial design by making a new mesh can be quick and looking at the result even quicker, but intermediate processing time remains constant. Therefore it is desirable to reduce analysis time, and then to minimise the number of analyses made. \n The problem then is to identify which parts of the problem could benefit from application of multiprocessor computing techniques and which parts are best done serially. The problem geometry and material definition phase (i) together with the post-processing phases (iv) are usually treated as sequential. \n DECOMPOSITION STRATEGIES AND MACHINE TYPES \n Problems generally exhibit a wide degree of variability in the amount of parallelism that is evident in the problem itself. \n In developing a concurrent program one is faced with the following tasks [3]: (i)  being able to express parallelism (ii) having work spread across multiprocessors (iii) reducing cross processor communication (iv) satisfying any real time constraints (this last point will not be further discussed other than implicitly in terms of speedup relative to sequential program variants) \n In (i) parallelism in a problem can be domain based. Here the problem is decomposed spatially, the resulting pieces are described and manipulated independently and then the pieces reassembled to form a description for the entire problem. Alternatively the problem could be decomposed on some algorithmic criteria such as the concurrent evaluation of the many independent terms needed to fill a matrix. Points (ii) and (iii) suggest that any algorithm designed will have to reflect the topological constraints imposed by the target hardware. Thus the best algorithm for one type of machine architecture may be totally unsuitable for another.  \n Parallel Computing Machine architectures may be classified according to Flynns Classification [4]. This classifies a parallel architecture according to a specification of single 'S' or multiple 'M' operations in its instruction stream 'I' and data stream 'D'. This results in the four letter acronyms, SIMD Single Instruction Multiple Data and MIMD Multiple Instruction Multiple Data. The memory in a MIMD machine can be either shared between processors distributed locally to individual processors. Both machine types have inherent characteristics which are important to recognise when developing concurrent algorithms. For example in an SIMD machine if the calculation of a quantity does not rely on the completion of a calculation elsewhere in the hardware array then vector processing can occur at speeds limited only by memory access time. Thus in the limit of zero time per vector operation the throughput of the system will be defined by the sequential, computational requirements that exist within the problem. With MIMD machines more complex operations can occur in parallel. However synchronisation adds a source of efficiency loss due to processor latency. When concurrent techniques are applied to the problems of interest to high frequency problems disappointing results often occur primarily due to the conditions cited above. \n APPLICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE \n Table 1 presents a review of some applications of concurrent programming methods to electromagnetic field problems. The review presented is in no way definitive, its purpose is to show the diversity of numerical EM field methods that have been mapped into concurrent algorithms. The main topics defined above are repeatedly addressed in this table, i.e. matrix fill, matrix solve, choice of hardware and language and resultant algorithm efficiency. Three broad classes of activity arise on inspection of this table. \n The first is parallelization of already established code [5], [6]. This approach generally tends to be disappointing due to the complexity of identifying code sections which can be easily parallelized. The second is coding of techniques in which large matrix fill time is expected due to myriad complex but independent operations being necessitated [7], [8], [9]. This generally tends to be successful due to the localised nature of the computations involved. The third is in the solution of the resultant systems of equations [51, [8], [9], [12], [16], [17], [19], [21] either by direct or by iterative solution methods. The degree of success of this activity depends on the nature of the methods employed. Fourth the variety of hardware options and language derivative available is bewildering. In concurrent algorithms the identification of performance is a difficult proposition. Principally this is due to the subtle nature of the hardware software partitioning effects inherent in the programming task. This makes the ultimate success of concurrent codes in terms of speed advantage extremely critical on choice of hardware and hardware connectivity. The fifth and most dominant feature of Table 1 is the number of workers who have adopted spatial decomposition as the primary strategy for parallelizing specific problems [51], [71], [11], [14], [l8], [19]. The details of the various strategies for algorithmic decomposition are problem specific and will not be further pursued. Finally only very few problems are truly parallel with minimum communication requirements so that linear speedup with processor addition can be attained [20]. \n SPATIAL DECOMPOSITION \n Spatial decomposition appears to be an important theme which occurs in many concurrent algorithms. The principle technique is to reduce a system into its constitutive parts overlapping on their boundaries and to allocate each part to a separate processor. Computational time and memory requirement are improved and additionally subsystems can be individually modified under change of stimulus or structure without the need for global reformulation. With this method the only information to be passed between processors occurs along these spatial boundaries, all other calculations pertaining to each subdomain are computed locally. Eventually a global solution for the problem can be achieved. Krons [2] work suggests a formal method for defining the necessary tears and methods of reassembly. The author has exploited Krons tearing techniques supplemented with Krons circuit analogs of Maxwells equations [27] on arrays of MIMD processors. The resulting method termed the Diakoptics Network Modelling Method [28], has been used very successfully to solve field problems associated with planar microwave MMIC structures in a computationally efficient way. This work suggests that the actual connectivity of individual processors as a tree, pipeline, torus etc. and also the selection of the number of processors used must be done on individual merit. Again this observation suggests that the actual detail of the concurrent algorithms developed will depend to an extent on programmer experience and preference. One interesting and recurrent observation is that for many problem formulations small numbers of MIMD processors work best. \n ALGORITHMIC DECOMPOSITION \n In algorithmic decomposition the structure inherent within the equations governing the problem or the order in which they are to be solved is exploited. Algorithms like TLM [10], [13] appear to decompose best when the algorithm used is based on mimicking the basic scattering process. Here SIMD machines work at best. Consider now different methods of solving non-linear circuit problems of the type relevant to high frequency circuit designers. Sobhy [29] decomposed the time domain circuit equations prior to solution resulting in a novel scheme whereby any linear or non-linear set of circuit equations can be mapped to four processes. One represents Kirchoffs Current Law, another Kirchoffs Voltage Law, a third the network tree processes, t, () and last the co-tree process, c, (of the form ). With this formulation it is (i) theoretically possible to solve a nonlinear problem in the time domain without iteration (in practice some iteration is needed because of loop stabilisation requirements), (ii) optimise the network response without reformulation of the equations. The second point is particularly useful if the circuit approach and electromagnetic field approaches are to combined to form advanced hybrid field/circuit simulation, see next section. \n Algorithmic decomposition may also be usefully applied in the design of concurrent circuit analysis programs that use the Harmonic Balance Method [30]. The QUB microwave research group is currently addressing this problem with some interesting findings. The first is that harmonic balance uses independent linear and non-linear circuit evaluations (based on spatial decomposition). In addition the network response to a frequency vector can be independently generated for each frequency. Finally the optimisation procedure used to enforce the interface conditions at linear non-linear circuit partition boundaries has potential for further parallelization. \n HYBRID EM FIELD / NON-LINEAR CIRCUIT SIMULATION \n If advanced circuit design methods for high frequency electronics are to advance into the regime of 'right first time' design for MMICs such that MMIC custom cell placement effects are to be incorporated in a quantitative fashion; then a new class of circuit simulator is required [32]. Attempts at combining EM field mapping and non-linear circuit elements using conventional methods soon run into computational time and memory usage difficulties [31]. Presently circuit models are used to assist the design/simulation activity with an attendant loss of accuracy (sometimes to the point of losing quantitative prediction). However by exploiting concurrent techniques for circuit simulation with those of electromagnetic field simulation it is conceptually possible to resolve the computational difficulties stated above. \n Preliminary work at QUB in this new area of activity appears promising. An interesting outcome has been to show that once the designer is relieved of the difficult tasks of quantification and minimisation of deleterious first order effects such as parasitic component coupling in MMIC design, then the requirement for ultra conservative design be relaxed. In this way confidence to develop new circuit types can be evolved due to the additional simulation support presented by such new concurrent CAE tools. \n CONCLUSIONS \n It has been demonstrated that high frequency electronic problems can be solved with varying degrees of success using multiprocessor hardware and concurrent extensions of classical high level languages. It is also evident that spatial domain decomposition is a much favoured method for parallelization with algorithmic decomposition generally being more difficult to achieve. Unlike sequential algorithms parallel algorithms are defined by the hardware on which they run. Also the variety of language and hardware types in use make direct comparison of performance difficult. Finally work on concurrent non-linear circuit solvers is less mature than that for EM field solvers and up to now the important class of hybrid non-linear circuit/EM field simulators has remained virtually unexplored.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ea7bc2f6-205f-4202-b1de-c20e4bf1e48a", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.593189+00:00"}

INTRODUCTION \n The need for improved control of electricity generation equipment has been steadily increasing. Modern generating sets tend to be less stable than their predecessors, and therefore demand complex control systems for their successful operation. Control equipment manufacturers have recognised this and have developed computer-based systems. Digital governors have been in existence for some time now, and digital voltage regulators are available (Ham, 1989). \n Self-tuning and adaptive control can offer advantages over conventional control (Wu and Hogg, 1988). Simulation studies have proven the theoretical possibility of improving control performance, but implementation problems have hampered advancement on real systems. A major difficulty is the lack of processing power available from conventional microprocessors. While some success has been achieved with specialised devices such as Digital Signal Processors (Gurubasavaraj, 1989), the underlying architecture is suitable only for a limited number of applications. Alternative control architectures are therefore being developed, and one promising scheme involves the use of parallel processing with Inmos transputers. \n The transputer is a general-purpose, single-chip highspeed microprocessor, which is a member of the MIMD (multiple-instruction, multiple-data) class of parallel architectures (Flynn, 1966). The T800 architecture combines a 32-bit, 10 MIPS RISC processor with an on-board 64-bit floating point unit, memory and communications. The key technical feature, which distinguishes the transputer from other high-performance microprocessors, is the addition of four high-speed, duplex links. These allow a single transputer to be used as a node among any number of similar devices to form a parallel processing system. Control engineers view the transputer as a powerful processing element capable of easy implementation in an embedded parallel processing system, and an increasing number of successful applications are being reported (Irwin and Fleming, 1992). \n Increased computational speed is of course the primary benefit of parallel processing, allowing faster systems to be controlled and giving the control engineer the choise of added complexity in the control algorithm. Easy expansion, within a uniform hardware and software base, is another advantage, since it is possible to add more processors as required. This implies reduced development and maintenance costs in real-time computer control applications. \n This paper reports on transputer-based parallel adaptive control of a laboratory turboalternator, and describes how the hardware and software system developed achieves the specified real-time performance. Algorithm mapping issues are also discussed with respect to parallel implementation of SISO and MIMO self-tuning controllers. The hardware system includes the industry standard VME bus architecture and employs Intel 8751, Motorola 68020 and Inmos transputer systems to perform various tasks in a pipelined structure. \n Initial tests were performed on a realistic and proven simulation of a three-phase turboalternator running in parallel with both the measurement and control algorithms on a network of T800 transputers (Brown and Swidenbank, 1991). Building on this work, a comprehensive set of new results for both SISO and MIMO self-tuning regulators are presented here. These include real-time tests carried out on a scaled laboratory turbogenerator under SISO, multiloop and multivariable concurrent control. These confirm the improved performance advantages of using parallel adaptive control. \n The paper makes an original contribution in two directions. The work reported constitutes a practical real-time control application of parallel processing, since the adaptive controller algorithm is realised on a processor array thus enabling the benefits of this significant new technology to be assessed in a field of industrial significance. Secondly, the adaptive control results from the laboratory micromachine are noteworthy, since technological limitations have previously mitigated against implementation of these advanced controllers at the sort of sample rates required by power system equipment manufacturers. Thus, the graphs given in section 5 allow adaptive controllers to be assessed against fixed-gain control and, significantly, illustrate the potential benefits of moving from SISO adaptive control to the considerably more complex multivariable strategy. \n 2. SELF-TUNING CONTROL \n  2.1 SISO Control Strategy  \n A minimum-variance, self-tuning regulator (STR) with an auxiliary predictor is applied to the synchronous generator excitation loop, replacing conventional automatic voltage regulation (Wu and Hogg, 1988) as shown in Fig. 1. \n\n The outputs and inputs of the controlled system are :  where V  t  (t) is the terminal voltage at time t, w is the speed in rad s  -1 , V  r  (t) is the input to the exciter, and <*> delta sign </*> represents deviation from steady-state. \n In the SISO case, the generator can be described as :  where y(k) and u(k) are the output and input of the system at the sample instant k. A, B, and C are polynomials in the backward shift operator q  -1  and <*> sign </*> (k) is an uncorrelated random sequence of zero mean disturbing the system. \n Rewriting the equation in predictor form leads to the following general control law, \n\n The parameters of the polynomials F, G and C are determined by Extended Recursive Least Squares (ERLS). If the orders of the polynomials are taken as 3, and if the first parameter, g0, of G is fixed, then there are 8 parameters to be estimated. R is a constant which determines the weight placed on the control signal in the generalised minimum-variance derivation (Wu and Hogg, 1988). \n With the order of C chosen to be zero, the control reduces to equation.\n \n The parameters of the polynomials F and G are now obtained using Ordinary Recursive Least Squares (RLS) and there are 5 parameters to be estimated. \n 2.2  MIMO Control Strategies  \n Two approaches may be adopted when considering turbogenerator AVR and governing systems. One employs a separate self-tuner for both the governor and AVR and is referred to as \"multi-loop control\". The other method integrates both the governor and AVR systems into a single multivariable controller. Figs 2 and 3 illustrate these two procedures. \n In the multi-loop case, the governor and AVR control laws are the same as for the SISO system. The multivariable controller has the same form as the SISO algorithm, except that the associated vectors are replaced by matrices, and multivariable least squares is used to estimate the system parameters. Although the multi-loop system is easier to design and requires much less computation time to implement, it is expected that the multivariable controller will better exploit the inherent coupling in the turbogenerator system (Ibrahim  et al  , 1989). \n 2.3.  Supervision Scheme  \n Previous work has shown that self-tuning regulators will work well if the preconditions for stability and convergence are satisfied (Wu and Hogg, 1988). The non-linear nature of power systems means that the linear model is only valid for a small region about a given operating point. Any deviation form this region will cause the estimator to work outside the linear range and the resulting model will therefore be invalid. \n\n Various methods have been developed to ensure satisfactory operation of adaptive controllers, which usually take the form of protection algorithms for the parameter estimator. In this work, a number of methods were combined for this purpose, including offset rejection, modification of the RSL algorithm to deal with time-varying systems, moving boundaries for the estimated parameters, and switching the estimator on and off during transient conditions (Wu and Hogg, 1988 ; Brown and Swidenbank, 1991). \n 3. LABORATORY SYSTEM \n 3.1  Micromachine  System \n The micromachine system consists of a small synchronous generator with an associated turbine simulator, connected to the laboratory busbar through a transformer and artificial transmission line. The synchronous generator is a 3 kVA, 220 V, 50 Hz, 1500 rpm 4-pole microalternator, whose parameters have been specifically designed to match those of a full-size generator. The alternator is driven by a separately excited d.c. motor, whose field current is kept constant. The torque supplied by the motor is therefore directly proportional to its armature current, being controlled by an analogue turbine simulation. The simulation represents a 3-stage steam turbine with reheater. The micromachine constitutes a two-rotating mass model of the shaft dynamics, whereas a full-scale system may have six rotating masses. \n Although a laboratory machine cannot be realistically expected to give results that precisely match those obtainable in a full-scale power station, it does provide a means of verifying the behaviour of controllers which have proved to be successful in simulation. As well as allowing a particular control system to be tested under real-time constraints, the micromachine provides a more stringent testing environment, incorporating many features not possible with a computer simulation. Effects such as non-ideal transducer characteristics leading to limited resolution and noise, saturation and other non-linearities present on the real machine, computational delays and variations in busbar voltage and frequency, all contribute to the problems that any controller will face in a practical situation. \n 3.2  Fourier Measurement Algorithm  \n Conventional methods for determining machine terminal quantities like voltage and power rely on rectification and summation of the individual phase quantities to form an average RMS value. Since the voltage and current waveforms generated by a synchronous machine are rarely perfectly balanced, and are invariably contaminated by harmonics and noise, these traditional methods often produce poor representations of the true terminal quantities, especially during transient periods. Inaccurate measurement of feedback variables inevitably leads to a degradation in control performance and often means that the expected performance benefits from more advanced controllers do not accrue. \n One method which can be used to extract the fundamental components from complex periodic waveforms, such as those produced by a synchronous generator, is based on a finite Fourier series. Fundamental waveform components derived using this method can be combined to produce accurate measurements of terminal quantities under both symmetrical and unsymmetrical transient and steadystate conditions (Brown and Swidenbank, 1991). \n 3.3  VME Hardware System  \n In order to advance the theoretical work and to create a structurally open-ended environment, a VME busbased system was chosen as the host hardware for the implementation of both the control and measurement algorithms. This standard bus system is already being used by power systems control manufacturers, and is well established in many industries. \n Voltage and current transformers are attached directly to the outputs from the microalternator. Signals from these devices are passed through anti-aliasing low-pass filters on a custom designed board and then on to the analogue i/o board. An 8751 microcontroller generates an interrupt signal at 12 times the system frequency (600 Hz). This interrupt triggers the master 68020 board to read in samples of the filtered electrical waveforms from the analogue i/o board and to read in the values of speed and rotor angle calculated by the 8751. On completion of the read sequence, the raw values are then passed to shared DMA (Direct Memory Access) memory to be picked up by the IMS BO11 T 800 transputer. The transputer then performs the Fourier measurement algorithm to produce the electrical terminal quantities. \n\n 3.4  Multi-task Architecture  \n The configuration of the hardware and software systems needed to implement the various controllers follow closely that described above for the measurement system. An extra task is required in this instance, however, to look after the control output to the generator excitation and governoring systems. This takes the form of a simple program which convents the per unit output excitation and governor signals from a particular controller into suitably scaled values and then writes them to the digital-to-analogue converters on the analogue input-output board. \n This program must run on the VME transputer since the D/A converters are accessed through DMA memory on the VME bus. The program therefore executes in parallel with the Fourier measurement program. The control algorithm runs on the PC based TRAM (transputer module) and communicates with the measurement program and the digital-to-analogue conversion program via an Inmos link wire. \n The entire process can be visualised in Fig. 5. \n\n As can be seen, both the Fourier measurement algorithm and the digital-to-analogue conversion routine run on the same transputer. The processor must therefore schedule cpu time between the two programs. This does not cause any conflict or affect the synchronism of the measurement system since the D/A conversion program takes only a negligible time to execute when compared to the computationally complex Fourier algorithm.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "23b12884-bc76-4036-a579-c204ce6495b0", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.594099+00:00"}
{"text": "<Rotational moulding>\n\n\n<$A>\n<$B>\n  COMPUTER SIMULATION OF THE ROTATIONAL MOULDING PROCESS  \n  Liang Xu <*> ampersand </*> R. J. Crawford  \n School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, The Queen 's University of Belfast, Ashby Building, Stranmillis Road, Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK, BT9 5 AH \n  Abstract:  In recent years, with the increasing demands being placed on the rotational moulding process, particularly with regard to thick-wall moulding, the need for an accurate computer simulation has become very apparent. Rotational moulding is a difficult process to model due to the complexities caused by the biaxial rotation of the mould, the physical and phase changes which take place in the plastic and the dynamic nature of the boundaries within the mould. In this paper, a new unsteady-state, non-linear heat transfer model of the rotational moulding process has been developed, together with an efficient numerical formulation for the simulation of heat transfer during the whole moulding cycle. The procedure uses modified boundary conditions for the solution of the internal air temperature field. The heat transfer between the inner mould surface and the internal air and the internal air temperature change due to the air mass changing during the moulding cycle have been analysed. This has resulted in a computer program which can predict accurately the internal air temperature profile through the cycle. This enables prediction of the heating time, cooling time and hence the overall cycle time for the process.\n\n  1 Introduction  \n Rotational moulding is a processing technique which is primarily utilized in the manufacture of hollow articles from thermoplastic and, to a limited extent, thermosetting materials.  1-17  Rotational moulding is generally regarded as a slow processing method because the plastic must be heated from room temperature, up to its melting temperature and back to room temperature when it is inside the mould. Initially, the material in the form of powder or liquid is placed in a shell-like metal mould. The closed mould is then rotated biaxially by the rotational moulding machine and indexed into an oven. The heat supplied by the oven melts the thermoplastic powder which then partially fuses together and the biaxial rotation causes a porous skin to be laid up on the mould inner surface. This gradually melts to form a polymeric shell attached to the internal surface of the mould. Sufficient time must be allowed in the oven for the material to completely distribute, fuse and consolidate. Subsequently, the mould is rotated to a cooling chamber, where it is quenched to the demoulding temperature. The cooling may be carried out by a fan which blows air over the mould, water spray, or a combination of both. When the mould is cold, it is opened and the solidified part is removed. Thereupon, the mould is recharged and the cycle repeated. \n In the past, technological advancement and understanding of the rotational moulding process has depended largely upon the experience of the moulders and the establishment of process conditions has been achieved on a trial and error basis.  18-25  Early work  16, 17, 24-30  helped to fill gaps in the understanding of the heat transfer which occurs during the rotational moulding process. Recent research  22  has also resulted in improvements in direct real time process control so that the trial and error aspects of the process have to a large extent been overcome. \n However, there are still difficulties in producing rotomoulded articles with very large wall thickness (i.e. greater than 15 mm). Current heat transfer analysis methods have proved to be unstable, in accurate and/or extremely demanding in computer time due to the complex thermal conditions within the multi-layer porous powder mass within the mould. It is evident that there is a need for thick wall rotomoulded products in, for example, the pipe industry. In this case, mouldings up to 40 mm thick are required and it is extremely expensive to optimize the process conditions for such products by trial and error. Hence there is a need for an accurate computer simulation of the process which will enable these types of thick wall products to be analysed. \n The development of such a simulation has been carried out at the Rotational Moulding Research Centre at the Queen 's University of Belfast.  20, 31-34  Previously two programs were developed  31-34  in an initial attempt at this problem. These proved to be extremely valuable in streamlining experimental research programs. However, a problem with the two existing programs is that they cannot predict the oven time, cooling time and cycle time for moulding part thicknesses over 12 mm. Above this thickness the analysis tends to become unstable. Also, they cannot accurately predict the internal air temperature profile which is now known  23, 24  to be so critical to the process. This is because at the time they were developed it did not appear necessary to address the complex problem of the moving boundary between the internal air and the melting, fusing, consolidating plastic adhering to the mould. \n The initial program developed was called 'ROTOSIM' and has been described in detail elsewhere.  20, 31, 32  This model examined the biaxial motion of a hollow mould containing a powder mass with a series of superimposed heat transfer models. The shape of the mould was defined by a grid of points in 3-D space. The grid was rotated according to a defined ratio of plate to arm rotational speeds. During this rotation, the relative motion of the powder pool was calculated to determine the region of mould/powder contact and the temperature profiles through the mould. The computer model calculated the rise in temperature of the mould and powder as heat is transferred from the oven environment. This program provided very accurate predictions of cycle times for wall thickness up to 12 mm.  32  \n Subsequently, in an attempt to examine the effect of internal air temperature, a program called 'ROHEAT' was developed.  34  In this case the internal air temperature was considered as a constant value. This assumption made the programming much simpler and it allowed the effects of internal heating and cooling to be explored. However, this assumption does not reflect the real rotational moulding situation. From rotational moulding experiments, it has been found that the internal air temperature changes with time during the whole moulding cycle and this temperature profile provides important quality control information for the moulding technique. Additionally, the important part of the heat transfer between the inner surface of the metal mould and the internal air mass at the initial stage of the rotational moulding process, i.e. before the plastic powder adhered to the inner metal mould wall, was not taken into account in the 'ROHEAT' and 'ROTOSIM' programs. Additionally, both of these programs required a considerable amount of computing time. This limits their usefulness on personal computers - particularly when the wall thickness of the moulded product is large. \n In this paper, a new unsteady-state, non-linear rotational moulding heat transfer model has been proposed and has been analysed in detail. The heat transfer mechanism used in this model have been developed to enable computation of the internal air temperature profile and it is possible therefore to provide estimates for the oven time, cooling time and the overall cycle time for various resins and for various thicknesses of mouldings, including very thick wall products. Based on this model, a more powerful rotational moulding computer simulation system with greatly reduced computing times has been developed. It is ideally suited for use on a PC. This has provided the opportunity to optimize the rotational moulding process conditions for rotomoulded products. It is anticipated that in the near future this information will be utilized in real-time control system for rotational moulding machines. \n  2 Modelling and numerical simulation of heat transfer during rotational moulding  \n 2.1  General  \n The heat transfer process which occurs during the rotational moulding process reflects the unique nature of this moulding technique. Understanding this process in an important and essential step in the understanding of rotational moulding. It is also very important with regard to product quality control and the economics of the process. \n The theories of heat transfer are well established but their application to the rotational moulding process is rare. This is because, on the one hand, the apparent simplicity of rotational moulding did not require detailed analysis and, on the other hand, those who recognized the need were put off by the complexity of the moving powder inside a rotating mould. This complexity arises from the interactions between the various heat transfer processes, the variation in conditions from one part of the system to another, the inherent complication of the tumbling powder, and the interaction of the thermal properties of plastics (i.e. thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, latent heat of fusion). Physical properties, mould shape, mould material, mould thickness, oven efficiency, part wall thickness and biaxial rotational speeds also have an important effect. \n By tradition, the process of heat transfer is classified into three basic distinct modes:  35  conduction, convection and radiation. The basic laws of heat transfer are simple, but their application to real situations is usually a very complicated matter. The heat transfer models developed for the rotational moulding process  20, 33  have become more and more complex as the models become increasingly sophisticated. \n For the purpose of developing this new computer simulation system for the rotational moulding process, the following approach was used. Firstly the heat transfer mechanism occurring during the process were defined. Next, mathematical models were developed to describe these heat transfer mechanisms and the necessary data was measured for several polymers. Then the numerical analysis methods were established. This was followed by the computer programming. Finally the predictions obtained from the program were compared with the experimental data measured using the ROTOLOG process controller. \n 2.2  Heat transfer analysis  \n Heat transfer in the rotational moulding process involves unsteady-state heat flow. In theory, during rotational moulding the heat is transferred from an oven, through a metal mould, then through a plastic bed and into the internal air space. The heat transfer can be broken down into a series of modules as follows:\n (1) Transition of heat from the air in the oven to the outer surface of the mould - boundary condition 1. (2) Heat transfer through the mould wall. (3) Heat transfer between the inner surface of the mould and the plastic bed - boundary condition 2. (4) Heat transfer through the plastic bed. (5) Transmission of heat from the plastic bed to internal air - boundary condition 3. (6) Heat transfer of the internal air mass. \n These six stages will be analysed in detail below. \n The true mathematical description of the heat transfer in the rotational moulding process is complex because of the movement of the powder inside the mould and the variation of the physical and thermal properties of the material. The simulation of the physical problem that corresponds to the actual rotational moulding process conditions is also complex. Though in principle such a simulation may be feasible, it may be of little use to industry if it is very expensive due to the extremely intensive computations involved. Therefore, it is necessary to make appropriate simplifications in the simulation. During this research, the following initial assumptions were made for the purpose of simplification: (a) Initially the powder is assumed to be in the bottom of the mould and so the internal air is heated through the mould wall by the oven. Recent video evidence has shown that the powder pool does remain essentially static with a slow 'crawling' motion over the inside surface of the mould. (b) Once the polymer melt temperature is reached the powder is assumed to be in static contact with all parts of the internal surface of the mould. (c)\tThe heat transfer is one-dimensional, i.e. what happens at one point on the wall is the same at all other points. This is reasonable because under normal circumstances the surface of the mould will be at a uniform temperature and heat transfer is towards its centre. (d) The mould shape is cylindrical. This assumption is made (i) to keep the analysis within reasonable bounds and (ii) because many thick wall products are cylindrical, e.g. pipes.\n The fundamental laws of heat conduction and convection take the form of a set of differential equations for temperature  T  . In this model, a more general finite difference approximation has been used for the solution of the partial heat transfer equations. During the numerical analysis of the model, both explicit and implicit methods have been used to solve the heat transfer equations.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "9bd6f262-7bc8-4104-b851-22a8740235db", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.595109+00:00"}
{"text": "<Image processing>\n\n\n<$A>\n<$B>\n  A HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGE FOR PARALLEL IMAGE PROCESSING  \n John Brown and Danny Crookes \n Most published research in the field of parallel image processing has tended to be in the areas of parallel architectures and parallel algorithms. Work on the development of software tools such as languages has generally been less extensive. This paper describes some research which is intended to redress the balance a little, by describing I-BOL - an application-specific high level programming language intended for implementing low-level image processing applications on parallel architectures. In particular, I-BOL has been designed to be capable of implementation on distributed memory parallel machines such as transputer networks. This paper introduces the core concepts of I-BOL: its view of an image as a set of tuples; user-defined neighbourhood function; and I-BOL 's facilities for recursive image processing. Solutions to a number of example problems illustrate particular aspects of the notation, including the Distance Transform, Histogram Equalization and the Hough Transform. Some consideration is given to the parallel aspects of the current implementation of I-BOL on a pipeline of transputers. A few performance measurements are quoted, giving execution times for the chosen examples on various sizes of transputer work. \n  Keywords: image processing, parallel languages, transputer networks, Image Algebra, recursive image processing  \n The application of parallelism to image processing has for long been recognized as offering considerable benefits. However, published research in this field suggests that most effort has been directed towards the development of parallel architectures and parallel algorithms. With some exceptions, work on software tools such as programming language has been less extensive. This in inevitable, since tool development for any application always lags behind algorithm development, and also since the use of tools can entail a certain loss of performance, particularly in a parallel context. However, as a step towards redressing the balance a little, this paper outlines a language for low level (parallel) image processing which has the aim of improving software productivity while yielding acceptably efficient parallel implementation. \n There is a definite need for tools which will speed up the software development process for parallel systems. This is particularly true of image processing, where it is usually necessary to experiment with different algorithms before determining the best solution. Software development needs to be rapid, but this conflicts with the need for efficient parallel implementations. Programming and evaluating a range of algorithms on, say, a transputer-based parallel system, can be a lengthy and error-prone process because of the need to distribute data and handle interprocessor communication. To speed up software development, the programmer should be relieved of as much of this detail as possible. A suitable programming language is a useful productivity tool, since it can hide the details of the parallel implementation, and enable a programmer to concentrate on the image processing aspects of the problem. General-purpose languages which provide array-processing abstractions for expressing parallelism are becoming available, including Fortran 90  1  and High Performance Fortran  2 , and will no doubt be very useful in the development of parallel programs. However, an  application-specific  language can make certain important assumptions, and choose higher level abstractions, which increase efficiency considerably. This is the approach we have adopted at QUB to language design for image processing. \n One such application-specific programming language for parallel image processing is the APPLY language.  3  APPLY was developed and implemented initially on the WARP machine at Carnegie Mellon University,  4  as a tool for writing low-level image processing algorithms.    Implementations   of it have now been provided for other architectures, including transputer-based machines.  5  In an APPLY program, the user writes a procedure which specifies the detailed operations to be performed at one pixel position in the image. The compiler then generates the code which causes the procedure to be applied to every pixel in the image. \n A different approach to APPLY was taken in early work in this field at QUB (Image Algebra Language) and its implementation on a network of transputers.  6,7  IAL was based on the abstractions of Image Algebra, a mathematical notation developed at the University of Florida for specifying image processing algorithms. IAL provided operations at the complete image level, with no individual pixel access. For instance, a version of the Sobel edge-finding operator could be coded in IAL as the single statement:  where S   h   and S   y   are the usual horizontal and vertical Sobel masks (whose weights would previously have been defined), and the operator '<*> asterisk </*> <*> plus sign </*> ' represents convolution. \n IAL proved useful for a range of low level image processing tasks, but was limited in its flexibility and expressive power, partly because it allowed no internal access to individual pixels of an image. Subsequent work to develop a more flexible and powerful notation than IAL has resulted in an extended image processing language, which we called I-BOL. (The name 'I-BOL' sounded appropriate for an image processing mechanism, but exactly what it stands for has yet to be decided!) As well as providing the 'complete image' operations of IAL as a subset, I-BOL permits access to image data at either the pixel or local neighbourhood level without being architecture-specific. \n The design philosophy of I-BOL has been to make parallelism implicit by providing image processing-oriented  programming abstraction  which are, however, capable of efficient parallel implementation. A key question is how to provide sufficient flexibility without making it impossible for the compiler to produce an efficient parallel implementation. A balance has to be struck between user freedom and the ability to perform automatic parallelization. I-BOL is a step beyond IAL in this direction. \n I-BOL has been implemented on a transputer network. The I-BOL compiler takes a program written in the language, and automatically parallelizes it by distributing the image data. 'Troublesome' features of a parallel implementation, such as interprocessor communication, and the management of borders around image segments, are taken care of by the compiler. The implementation is scalable in the sense that I-BOL programs will run on any number of processors without alteration (except for stating the actual number of processors). \n This paper outlines the main concepts upon which I-BOL is based. In particular, three novel aspects of the language are discussed in more detail: the view of an image as a set of tuples, user-defined neighbourhood functions, and I-BOL 's facilities for recursive image processing. A number of example programs illustrate particular aspects of the notation. These include high level programs for the Distance Transform, Histogram Equalization and the Hough Transform. Some consideration is given to the parallel aspects of the current implementation of I-BOL on transputers. A few performance statistics for the three example programs are then given for executing on transputer networks of size from 4 to 16. \n  STANDARD DATA STRUCTURES AND OPERATORS IN I-BOL  \n I-BOL provides a range of built-in types for representing data structures which are commonly used in low-level image processing. The following are the main data types available: <*> bullet point </*> Image type: For storing images (as 2D arrays of pixel) The pixel type can be either  integer, real or boolean;  <*> bullet point </*> Template type: Windows and weights for local neighbourhood operations (like a small 2D array). Templates can be used for different types of neighbourhood operations; <*> bullet point </*> Vector type: One dimensional array structures (indexed from 0): <*> bullet point </*> A Binaryimage type: A storage-efficient representation of sparse binary images (e.g. edge images). \n The standard data types  integer, real  and  boolean  are also provided. As is common in image processing, boolean data is usually compatible with integer arithmetic operations. \n\n As in IAL, the configuration and weights of templates can be defined initially in a  value  section; for instance:  value  \n\n Weights in a template can be left undefined (indicated above by '('), in which case they are not included in the computation. Also, a  target pixel position  must be indicated (within square brackets, like [4] above), for aligning the window with the image during processing. \n  Operations on complete objects  \n A full range of arithmetic, comparison and local neighbourhood operations is provided to operate on these data structures as indivisible objects. (Operations which explicitly access individual elements of these objects are considered later.) \n These object-level operations fall into the following categories: \n  image_operator_image  \n Point-to point combination of all corresponding pairs of image pixels, generating an image result. e.g. \n  image_operator_scalar  \n Point-to-point combination of all image pixels with scalar value, generating an image result. (This also covers  scalar_operation_image  operations).\ne.g.  \n  vector_operator_vector  \n Point-to-point combination of all corresponding pairs of vector elements, generating a vector result e.g.  \n  vector_operator_scalar  \n Point-to-point combination of all vector elements with a scalar value, generating a vector result. e.g.  \n  image_ operator_template  \n The standard set of Image Algebra local neighbourhood operations is provided. These take an image and a template, and produce a result image. The range of operators includes:  e.g.  \n  global image and vector operations  \n These operations produce a scalar result, based on an entire image or vector. The global operators include: max min sigma count {applied to boolean image: the number of 'true' pixels} e.g.  \n A range of built-in functions provides standard mathematical operations on scalars, vectors and images (e.g. float, sin, abs). The standard set of scalar arithmetic and comparison operators is also available. Fuller details of these and other operations can be found elsewhere. \n  IMAGES AS SETS: A NOTATION FOR PIXEL ACCESS  \n When accessing individual pixels of an image, the conventional view of an image is as a two-dimensional array. The operations involved in processing such a structure are frequently expressed in standard programming languages using single or double loop constructs. With such an approach, programs can become architecture-dependent, since loop constructs may have to be written with a particular architecture or number of processor in mind. \n The I-BOL notation provides an alternative abstraction of an image. It treats an image as a  set of tuples,  one tuple per pixel. An individual tuple specifies the pixel position and its grey level, and has the form in I-BOL:\n < row, column, grey level at this position >  e.g. < i, j, g[i,j]>\nA complete image may be considered as a set of such items, denoted in I-BOL as: { i, j, g[i,j] } \n For instance,  Figure 1b  shows a tuple set representation of the equivalent simple geometric image in  Figure 1a,  \n Of course, there is no obligation on an implementation actually to  represent  such an image in this tuple format behind the scenes (though there might be times when it is useful to do so). But as a programming abstraction for specifying images, it is a convenient standard notation. \n  Constructing an image as a set  \n Forming a new image in I-BOL is a matter of constructing a new set of tuples. I-BOL therefore uses a notation based on the standard method for constructing a set, in which an image can be defined as:  \n This can be written using the I-BOL constructor notation as:\n{ i, j, g[i,j] : C1, C2, C3 . . .} \n In this construct, ':' is read as 'such that'. C1, C2 and C3 denote boolean conditions, which must either be true, or be made true during the formation of the set (i.e. a condition can either  qualify  a potential member, or  generate  potential members). A condition may be made 'true' by appropriate instantiation of variables within it. Thus the above constructor could be read as:\n \"Find all substituations for i, j and g[i, j] such that C1, C2 and C3 are true\"  \n This structure is called an  image constructor . Syntactically, it is an expression. For instance:  \n This will construct an image  Image1  in which the grey level of each pixel corresponds to the pixel's distance from the top left hand corner of the image. The bounds for i and j are implicitly defined by the declared bounds of Image1. Note that the condition imposes no constraint on the coordinates i and j. In general, for assignment to an image declared in the normal way, the tuples are defined over the declared space, and the conditions are used to calculate the grey level. For any position for which the conditions fail, an appropriate default grey level is defined for that position: 0 for interger images, 0.0 for real, and  false  for boolean. Thus, a boolean image which could be used to implement an ideal filter, comprising just those pixels within a radius R of the centre (X  0 , Y  0 ), could be constructed as:  \n  Vectors as sets  \n In a similar way to images, a one-dimensional vector can be viewed as a set of tuples. For convenience, the index of a tuple in a vector is implicit, and can be deduced from the subscript in the data value. Thus a vector is written as a set of indexed values, as in: { v[i] } A vector can be constructed using the constructor notation, as in, for instance:  \n  Pixel referencing  \n I-BOL provides restricted access to the internal components of an existing image (or a vector) in several ways, but only ever within an image constructor. When constructing a set of pixels whose positions are specified in the constructor as <i, j> , it is possible to reference the following sub-components of an image:\n (i) all individual pixels of an image, whose positions are normally specified relative to <i, j> ; (ii) all local neighbourhoods, or  patches  , within an existing image, i.e. all subsets of pixels within a specified region relative to <i,j> .

{"text": "<Concrete slabs>\n\n\n<$A>\n<$B>\n  Post-Tensioned Concrete Flat Slabs at Edge Columns  \n by Adrian E. Long and David J. Cleland \n  An experimental study of the behavior of post-tensioned unbonded concrete flat slabs is presented.  This describes the testing of five model slabs that closely simulated an exterior panel in a real structure but at a reduced scale. The paper discusses the behavior at three stages: during transfer, service conditions, and at ultimate load. The ultimate capacities are compared with current design provisions, and modifications are recommended. \n  Keywords: columns (supports); concretes; concrete slabs; connections;  flat concrete slabs; models;  post-tensioning;  prestressed concrete; tests. \n Flat slabs offer an efficient and economical method of construction for commercial and industrial buildings. Post-tensioning in place of reinforced concrete leads to further advantages in economy and versatility. The enhanced flexural characteristics of post-tensioning provide the potential for longer spans without increasing the slab depth. However, flexural failure is not the only limit state to be considered. Punching at the slab-column connections in flat slab structures is frequently more critical, and in post-tensioned slabs this is even more likely to be the case, since current building codes allow only a modest increase in the punching shear strength due to post-tensioning compared to conventional reinforcement. \n ACI-ASCE Committee 4231  1  has recommended a simple equation for shear strength that incorporates a term for the level of average prestress. This has been based on experimental results of a small number of isolated interior column models, where a uniform distribution of shear stress around a critical perimeter has been assumed. For edge columns, the same equation for shear strength may be used with the critical shear stress obtained from a consideration of the moment transfer effect and the nonsymmetrical shear perimeter.  2  \n  RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE  \n Little experimental work has been carried out to investigate the validity of applying the ACI-ASCE Committee 423 approach to edge column locations in post-tensioned slabs. Tests on multipanel models at the University of Texas  3,4  included some edge column failures, and a series of four tests on single isolated edge column models has been reported recently by Foutch, Gamble, and Sunidja.  5  This paper shows that the code provisions for exterior columns are very conservative, particularly for cases where the tendons perpendicular to the edge are banded. \n  OBJECTIVES  \n An experimental investigation was initiated to study the behavior of edge panels in post-tensioned unbonded slabs with the aid of models representing the critical edge column-slab connection. Considerable importance was placed on simulating the prototype structure in every detail. The variables considered in the test series were: a) the level of average prestress, b) the distribution of prestressing within the panel, and c) the tendon profile. \n  TEST SPECIMENS  \n The test series was based on a prototype structure that is shown in Fig. 1. The 8.25-in. (210-mm) deep slab was designed on the basis of a 30.0-ft (9.14-m) span, a superimposed dead load of 15 lb/ft  2  (0.72 kN/m  2  ), and a live load of 50 lb/ft  2  (2.40 kN/m  2  ). To achieve full dead load balance in the interior panels, a level of average prestress of 260 psi (1.80 N/mm  2 ) was required with the tendon drape shown in Fig. 1. However, to allow for the smaller drape of the tendons in the edge panel, prestress at this location was increased to 340 psi (2.35 N/mm  2  ). Under service loads, the maximum tensile stress in the concrete would be 167 psi (l.15 N/mm  2  ) or 2.4 /f  c  and the maximum compressive stress 796 psi (5.48 N/mm  2  ). \n Although service load tensile stresses were very small, a mat of bonded reinforcement was placed directly over the columns in the top of the slab in accordance with normal practice. Four No. 8 bars were specified in each direction. \n  Model configuration  \n Approximately 1/4-scale models of the type used by Neth  6  were chosen (Fig. 2). The advantages of this structural model over other isolated slab-column models are as follows: a. The slab width is equal to one bay and therefore directly comparable to the section used in equivalent frame analyses b. The slab deformations are similar, if not the same, as those in the prototype. At failure, the cone of failure intersects the slab edge, whereas only torsional cracks are in evidence in models that do not have deformation similitude. 7  c. Redistribution of moments, as a result of cracking and yielding, can take place in a manner similar to the prototype. d. The stress increase in the prestressing tendons is similar to a real structure, since stress equalization over a full panel length can take place. e. The model includes both column and middle strips, which enables the distribution of prestressed and ordinary bonded reinforcement to be studied. \n The test program consisted of five models that were identical in dimension (Fig. 2). The primary variables were the average level of prestress in the slab and the use of distributed or banded tendons. In all specimens, except one, the tendon layout and prestress level were designed to approximately balance the prototype dead load of 115 lb/ft  2  (5.60 kN/m  2  ). \n The 6.4-in. (162.5-mm) square columns were supported horizontally at approximately 24 in. (600 mm) above and below the slab. Details of the slab reinforcement are presented in Fig. 3 and 4 and summarized in Table 1. Prestressing wires of 0.2-in. (5-mm) diameter coated in a water-repellant grease were used to model the 7-wire strand of the prototype. After stressing, each wire had an effective force of 4 kips (17.8 kN) in Specimen E1 and 4.50 kips (20.0 kN) in all other specimens (the number of wires being altered to compensate). To allow for the higher average level of prestress in Specimen E3, the drape of the prestressing wires was reduced relative to E2 so that the overall load-balancing effect was the same. The bonded reinforcement, No. 2 bars (6-mm diameter) over the column, was generally in compliance with Sections 18.9.3.3 and 18.9.4 of Reference 2, except that the area and number of bars perpendicular to the free edge were increased by 50 percent in Model E1, which had distributed prestress, and the length was increased by about 50 percent in Model E5. \n  Materials  \n The ultimate strength of the 0.2-in. (5-mm) diameter prestressing wires was 230 ksi (1580 N/mm  2  ). The bonded reinforcement was ribbed high-yield steel with a yield point at 75.0 ksi (517 N/mm  2  ). \n The concrete was made from a 1/4-in. (6-min) maximum-size crushed basalt, a coarse grit, sand, and Type 1 portland cement. Trial mixes were made to arrive at a suitable concrete with a realistic ratio of tensile to compressive strength (Table 2). \n  INSTRUMENTATION AND TEST SETUP  \n A self-stressing test frame also capable of providing restraint to the top and bottom of the columns was used. The vertical load at the bottom of the lower column and reaction required to maintain lateral stability at the top of the upper column were transferred through roller bearings. Consequently, the horizontal reaction in the direction of moment transfer at the end of each column, and hence the bending moment, could be measured using load cells. \n To model a uniformly distributed load on the slab, loads were applied at 16 points on the surface. A system of orthogonal distribution beams was used to load each half-panel of the specimen, and each was activated by a hydraulic ram reacting against the main loading beams of the test frame. \n To achieve the correct boundary conditions along the continuous edges, a system of restraints was used. The slab edge was cast with discontinuities so that this restraining system prevented curvature perpendicular to the slab edge only, not parallel to the slab edge. \n Force in eight typical prestressing wires was monitored using both 11.2 and 22.5-kips (50 and 100-kN) capacity load cells. Initially, these load cells were used to assess the friction loss and loss due to wedge set in each wire. This was generally around 8 percent and subsequently the jacking force was set to allow for this. \n Displacement transducers were located beneath the slab to measure displacement at significant locations and five inclinometers were attached to the soffit of the slab to measure rotation along the free edge. These were not sufficiently sensitive to measure column rotation, so a vertical arm was attached to the column at slab level and the horizontal displacements at its ends were measured. \n TEST PROCEDURE \n A small number of prestressing wires was stressed for handling purposes before transferring each specimen to the test frame. Once in place the edge restraint system and loading beams were fixed in place while the prestress was increased to about 1/8th of the full value (the weight of the equipment and the self-weight of the slab equalled about 1/8th of the prototype dead load). From this datum, load was applied in three increments to a value equivalent to the full prototype dead load, while after each increment a commensurate increase in the prestressing was applied. Slab deflections and column moments were monitored at each increment. \n The vertical live load was applied in increments up to service load and then reduced to zero (i.e., dead load only) several times to observe the serviceability behavior of each specimen and to insure that all aspects of the test setup were functioning satisfactorily. The ultimate load test was then carried out by applying the load in increments and recording all the instrumentation at each increment. In all specimens, except E1, the ends of the columns were readjusted to their original position before readings were taken to prevent error owing to movement of the column supports caused by strain of the load cells. \n At several stages throughout the test the slabs were examined for cracks that were then marked and photographed. \n  RESULTS  \n Application of the design live load did not cause cracking in any of the slabs, and in each case they behaved elastically, returning to almost exactly the same position on unloading. In the ultimate load test, cracking was first observed at corners of the columns and then across the inner face, at a value of live load between 50 and 100 percent above the design value. With a further increase in load, of about 60 percent of design load (30 lb/ft>  2  ), torsion cracks had extended from the initial crack to the free edge, making an angle of about 45 deg with the free edge. \n The cracking in the column region progressed in the form of radial cracks spreading from the column corners and inner face. Two cracks, generally along the lines of reinforcing bars, extended gradually to meet those originating at the opposite column (Fig. 5). Prior to failure, transverse cracks occurred on the underside of the slab midway between the columns. In Specimen E1, which had no bonded reinforcement in this region, the crack opened considerably and instantaneous deflections occurred. Although not required at service load, bonded reinforcement was incorporated at midspan in subsequent specimens, and these behaved much more satisfactorily in this respect. Six No. 2 bars were provided perpendicular to the direction of cracking. Cracks usually also occurred on the slab underside, along the line of the edge restraint, indicating significant sagging curvature at this location and consequently the effectiveness of the restraint. \n In all cases, the specimens failed by one of the columns punching through the slab. This took place suddenly and was accompanied by a loud noise and particles of concrete being projected from the failure zone. The extent of the failure zone in the direction of moment transfer was about 1/6th of the span, about coincident with the ends of the bonded reinforcement. In Specimen E5, longer reinforcing bars were used, and this resulted in a more compact failure zone and one that is likely to be able to carry, by dowel action, a greater reserve load after failure. \n An interesting characteristic of the failure is that it allows anchorages in the region to pull in, thereby losing most, if not all, of their force. This was particularly evident in Specimens E2, E3, and E5, all of which had banded tendons and medium to high prestress levels. The loss of prestress may, and in the case of Specimens E3 and E5 did, initiate failure at the second column. \n  Deflection  \n In each test the slab deflections increased more rapidly, due to cracking, as load increased. Specimens E1 and E4 generally exhibited the greatest deflection for any given load, since cracking tended to occur earlier and to widen more rapidly in these two tests. \n The deflection profiles for Specimen E5 are shown in Fig. 6. These are typical of those obtained for other tests, but E5 was instrumented more densely. Although at the initial stages the deflection profile along the line joining the columns infers almost zero slope at both the column and midspan, the situation at higher loads is different in that there is little evidence of a contraflexure point. This is due to flexural and torsional cracking in die column region, which permits large rotation of the slab relative to the column. \n The deflection profiles are all for load levels below that at which midspan cracking occurred. This is confirmed by zero slope at midspan for the deflection profiles along AB and the effectiveness of the edge restraint by the profiles along AC. \n  ACI member Adrian E.

{"text": "<Object recognition>\n\n\n<$A>\n  Chapter 9  3-D Object Recognition. Kenneth M. Dawson.  \n  There are not facts, only interpretations. \n Friedrich Neitzsche  \n Object recognition is the process of identifying material things by associating what is sensed with what is known. A wide diversity of approaches have been taken to object recognition; however,   \"there is no existing system that comes close to solving the general object recognition problem\"[11].   \n This chapter presents a new method of addressing the problem of three-dimensional object recognition of rigid objects on the basis of comparisons between  viewed  three-dimensional models (i.e. which are extracted from imaged data at runtime) and  known  object models (which are generated using Computer Aided Design data)  1 </sp/>. It addresses the problem in terms of sub-problems (i.e. the determination of orientation and the determination of position), as Ikeuchi does in [10], and provides a framework for comparing the object models using several different secondary representations of the models (which may be regarded, in the complex of the framework described, as forms of complex scalar transform descriptors). \n This technique overcomes the dependency of comparing models on the basis of primitive components (such as individual edges, vertices or surfaces), and provides a measure for evaluating the reliability of any determined match on the basis of a comparison of complete views of the models. The approach has been tested with theoretical models and models extracted from range data and is shown to work well as long as the models extracted are reasonably accurate. \n The model comparisons are performed indirectly using several different secondary representations which are derived from the models. Hence, as models are matched implicitly, rather than explicitly (using model components), the method developed herein has been dubbed  'implicit model matching'. \n When considering any object recognition strategy, it is necessary to address eight main issues: 1. The domain of objects to be recognised. 2. The allowed complexity of the scenes. 3. The representations to be used for both the  viewed , and the  known  objects. 4 The method(s) of obtaining the  known  object representations. 5 The method(s) of obtaining the  viewed  object representations. 6 The model invocation strategy (i.e. which  known  objects to consider for matching). 7 The model matching strategy. 8 The method of hypothesis verification. Each of these issues is considered in turn in the sections which follow. \n  9.1 Object Domain and Scene Complexity.  \n The problem being addressed is that of the automatic recognition of three-dimensional non-articulate  2  rigid objects. In this context, the problem is equated to the matching of a view of a solitary  3  3-D object model (the  viewed  model) with  known  object models in order to recognise the view of the observed object model. Recognition is taken to imply determination of the position and orientation of a  known  object model which best    matches   the  viewed  model (along with an associated    measure of its reliability). \n  9.2 Methods or representing and obtaining object models.  \n The issue of representation has already been addressed in chapter 8, but a brief summary is   in   order. There are two distinct classes of object representation used: 1. The first class of representation details 3-D objects so that they may be symbolically manipulated and considered from any viewpoint. The representation used here is a simple planar-surface based model similar to that of Roberts[13]. However, it should be noted that the recognition strategy employed is independent of the type of representation used to detail the objects.\n2. The second class of representation is derived from the first and, hence, the various different representations used from this class may be regarded as secondary representations of the detailed object models. They may also be regarded as complex scalar transform descriptors, as each representation is composed of a fixed-size array of scalars. These representations depend only on certain object parameters (e.g. orientation) and are used to guide the recognition system efficiently through the potentially exhaustive search for the correct position and orientation of the correct model. \n The four secondary representations which are used include: 1 Extended Gaussian Images. 2 Directional Histograms. 3 Needle Diagrams. 4 Depth Maps. \n Detailed  known  object models are specified using a CAD specification technique and detailed  viewed  models are derived from range images. Both of these methods (and all of the representations) are described in the previous chapter. \n  9.3 Model invocation.  \n Model invocation is the selection of  known  models with which to attempt matching. However, with the approach presented in this chapter, matching is performed between views of object models. Hence, rather than just invoke object models, it is necessary to invoke approximate  4  views of models. This inherently addresses model invocation (in the strict sense of the term); if no view of a particular model is invoked, then the model itself is not invoked. \n Model view invocation is performed by determining the possible orientations from which each  known  model could be viewed in order to result in a view similar   to   the  viewed  model. The focal axis of the camera with respect to the  known  model 's frame of reference is first determined, and subsequently possible values for the roll of the camera with respect to its own frame of reference (i.e. around the focal axis) are calculated; see figure 9.1. \n>\n It was noted above that the task of model invocation is to determine orientations from which each  known  model could be viewed, so that the resultant view might be similar to that of the  viewed  model. This is an important point, as it is indicative of the fact that, rather than compute transformations which theoretically map  known  models to the same 3-D space as the  viewed  model, the task of model invocation and model matching in this method is to determine potential orientations from which to view the  known  models, with respect to the individual  known  models frames of reference (much as Goad does in [8]). \n The  viewed  model should have a camera model of some sort associated with it (i.e. that which    represents the original viewing device). The camera model used with  known  models is similar, in that it uses the same internal parameters, although it is defined with respect to a different coordinate frame (i.e. that of the  known  object model). \n  9.3.1 Determining potential orientations of the focal axis.  \n In order to determine potential orientations of the camera with respect to a  known  model 's frame of reference, a sample of all possible orientations is used. This sampling of orientation space is defined by the tesselations of a Gaussian sphere. \n Using each of the directions associated with the sphere tesselations as possible orientations of the camera focal axis, directional histograms of the tilts visable from the  known  model are determined. These directional histograms are compared with a directional histogram of tilt determined from the  viewed  model, resulting in a degree-of-fit for each possible orientation. A degree-of-fit is calculated using normalised cross correlation for each invocation and gives a measure of likelihood that the model is at an orientation within the range defined by the relevant sphere    tesselation    5  is that which must be recognised. The orientations which possibly correspond to a match are defined by those    tesselations   of the sphere which exhibit local maximum values for the degree-of-fit of tilt (as they change slowly from    tessalation   to    tesselations  )  6  and the likelihood is defined by the degree-of-fit. \n An example of the comparison of tilts from each possible orientation is shown in Figure 9.2. The  known  model is considered from all possible viewpoints as defined by each tesselation of sphere, and each tesselation of the sphere is shown encoding the degree-of-fit determined through the comparison of tilt histograms. \n  9.3.2 Determining possible values of roll.  \n Having determined potential orientations for the camera focal axis, potential values for roll, around that focal axis, must be calculated. This is accomplished by comparing (using normalised cross correlation) the directional histogram of roll defined by the  viewed  model with that derived from the  known  model in an arbitrary roll, as viewed using the previously determined focal axis. The comparison is performed at all possible values  7  of roll (of the theoretical model), simply rotating  8  the roll histogram of the theoretical model in order to define each possible roll. Smoothing of the histograms before comparison again provides a smoothly changing degree-of-fit, and once again the local maxima define the potential matches. An example of the comparison of roll histograms is given in Figure 9.3. \n The result of this operation is the determination of viewing orientation frames of reference, defined with respect to  known  models frames of reference, which may provide views of those  known  models which are similar to the viewed model. \n\n  9.4 Model matching strategy.  \n Model invocation, in this method, supplies potential orientation frames of reference for  known  models. These, however, are only approximations as the orientation space is quite coarsely sampled. One task of model matching is, then, to fine tune these orientation frames and to determine the position of the viewing camera relative to the  known  model. \n Model matching consists of a number of steps, during which the orientation frames will either be accepted (and their updated versions passed to the model verification stage) or rejected. These steps are: 1 Determination of approximate object position. 2 Fine tuning of object orientation. 3 Fine tuning of viewed object position. 4 Fine tuning of object depth. 5 Fine tuning of viewed object position to sub-pixel accuracy. Each of these steps is discussed in turn. \n  9.4.1 Determining approximate object position.  \n In order to allow the position of the object to be fine tuned (and in order to allow the object to be viewed during tuning operations in general), the position of the camera with respect to the  known  model must be estimated. To do this, the position of the  viewed  model with respect to its viewing camera is used (refer to figure 9.4). The imaged centroid of the viewed model and an approximate measure of the distance of the  viewed  model from the viewing camera are both very easily computed. The position of the camera which views the  known  model is then approximated by placing the camera in a position relative to the  known  model 's 3-D centroid, such that the centroid is at the correct approximate distance from the camera (as determined from the  viewed  model), and is imaged by the camera in the same position as the  viewed  model 's imaged centroid. \n  9.4.2 Fine tuning object orientation.  \n Fine tuning object orientation is performed in a similar way to the approximate determination of object roll. Pitch, yaw and roll histograms derived from the theoretical model are compared to those derived from the  viewed  model. The differences between them indicate the amount by which the orientation may best be fine tuned (e.g. see figure 9.5) This is done within a limited range of angles (the range being defined by the sampling of the sphere which was used for sampling orientation space during the model invocation stage), and at reasonably high angular resolutions (i.e. 1/4  <*> degrees sign </*> ), in order to ensure accurate tuning. \n Additionally it should be pointed out that the individual fine tuning operations affect not only the current directional histogram (e.g. roll), but also, in a small way the other directional histograms (e.g. pitch, yaw). Hence the fine tuning is performed by calculating a specific directional histogram, tuning the relevant component of orientation, and then moving on to the next directional histogram. This is done until the amount of tuning for all components of orientation falls below the required accuracy, or until the total tuning on any of the orientations exceeds the range allowed (in which case the invoked model view is rejected). \n  9.4.2 Fine tuning viewed object position.  \n Fine tuning of the viewed object position may be formally defined as tuning of the relative position of the viewing camera with respect to the  known  models reference frame, by translation in the plane which is orthogonal to the focal axis of the camera (i.e. in the directions parallel to the image plane).", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "acc33e7d-47b7-488d-9ef9-6c6a215cdbf2", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.597961+00:00"}
{"text": "<Chemical pollution>\n\n\n<$A>\n  TOWARDS THE AGE OF CLEAN TECHNOLOGY  \n  N. O'Byrne  \n Increasingly, human-kind is learning that biological life on the planet is a very delicate phenomenon. It thrives only under finely balanced conditions. We call these conditions our 'environment'. It is our responsibility to future generations to prevent any threat to the environment at source. \n Today there are about 8 million registered chemicals in the world, and this total is forever increasing. Most, however, exist only in laboratories. Around 70,000 of them however are used daily by industry and individuals. \"Technological progress\" has created such a multiplicity of chemicals for different purposes that we are in danger of losing control over their known effects. Everyone of these chemicals affects the environment. Few are necessary for life, while others have negative effects on health, animal or plant life, or on climate. \n Most of the human-made chemicals do not occur naturally. Unlike natural substances which have a cycle within nature, synthetic substances follow their own rules, i.e. non-biological and toxic. Raw materials and energy are used and refined into products which after use can become persistent and toxic waste. Many new substances are designed to be very stable. They are virtually immune to biological breakdown. They will be in our environment for a long time. Freon is an example which will lead to damage to the ozone layer for the next 100 years. DDT and other PCBs are other examples of environmental toxins that will continue to cause damage for decades. If the invention, production and use of synthetic chemicals is allowed to keep increasing we risk a steady increase in environmental crises, either in the short run, or in the as yet unforeseen longer term. The risks arise from all aspects of the chemical process, i.e production, transport, use and disposal. \n It will soon be necessary to seriously consider reducing the flood of chemicals. The traditional approach to dealing with environmental threats posed by chemical processes has been to reduce the environmental load caused by emissions of various kinds. Purification plans or processes are used to take care of the immediately known harmful substances in industrial and household wastes. Often incinerators are used to try to destroy toxins. The problems with this approach is that many of the synthetic substances cannot be destroyed, only redistributed or diluted. Purification processes transfer the chemicals to a sludge which creates a further disposal problem. Incineration creates gases containing new and often even more toxic substances. We may soon be forced to review our approach to dealing with chemicals and the environment, if indeed it is not already too late. Increasing recognition must be given to what is known as the  \"Precautionary Principle\"  in dealing with discharges to the environment. This involves an acknowledgement that a substance could cause harm without scientific proof being presently available that it actually does cause harm. Problems often arise because only the short run consequences of large quantities of a chemical are known. For instance, sufficient data to predict human health effects from exposure (one chemical at a time) to the more than 70,000 synthetic chemicals now in production exists for less than 1% of these chemicals. Virtually nothing is known of the effects of chemical mixtures. Accidents are not provided for, except for emergency/disaster mopping-up plans. Long term consequences, however, can emerge where they are least expected. This is a lesson learned from past disasters. Must we always wait until there are enough dead or dying bodies around before taking action? We cannot afford more mistakes, or to wait until real harm has been proved before taking action. Adopting a preventative strategy will open a wide range of opportunities to avoid negative environmental consequences in the future. Such an attitude may make today 's environmental threats unnecessary, and perhaps even unprofitable. Such an attitude can serve to prevent environmental problems at source. This is relevant to all industries and should be integral to all development policies. The practicality of this approach can be considered in relation to the following example of Chlorinated Solvents and the Paper Industry. \n A 'solvent', as the name implies is something that dissolves something else. The most common solvent is ordinary water. Most substances are soluble in water. Many synthetic substances foreign to nature, however, are not soluble in water. To dissolve them, other substances not found in the natural environment are used. Various petroleum based organic solvents are therefore produced with qualities that make them suitable for this purpose. Chlorinated solvents are organic solvents that contain chlorine. Chlorine is classed as a halogen and organic substances containing halogens are called halogenated hydrocarbons. In addition to chlorinated solvents, this group contains environmental toxins such as DDT, Lindane (pesticides), other toxic PCB's (polychlorinated biphenyls) and also dioxins. <*> asterisk </*> Past experience with stable and toxic organic solvents has been an unhappy one for the environment. \n Chlorinated solvents are today spread around the world as they are volatile and evaporate easily. Globally, more than 6.14 million metric tonnes of commonly used halogenated solvents are produced and potentially released into the atmosphere each year. A few occur naturally. Methyl chloride can be produced by bacteria in the oceans or as a result of burning vegetation. However, of the total atmospheric content of halogenated hydrocarsons, less than 1 <*> per cent sign </*> comes from natural sources. Other chlorinated solvents exist entirely within our industrialised society with no natural source. \n The amount of chlorinated solvent in the atmosphere is determined by the lifetime of the substance and the rate at which it is added to by emissions. Carbon Tetrachloride, which is very stable, remains in the atmosphere for 76 years. Since it has    been   used in large amounts over the past decades, high concentrations have already accumulated. It is currently the most important non-CFC ozone depleter. In 1985 it was responsible for 8 <*> per cent sign </*> of total ozone depletion. Another common degreaser, Methyl Chloroform, could become a major ozone depleter world-wide in the next few decades unless use is checked now. \n Because chlorinated solvents have been used in industry for several decades, the health effects in the working environment are well known. They were initially regarded as relatively harmless with low toxicity. The dangers of skin damage or of long term inhalation are now known, and some unions recognise the need to limit worker exposure. All chlorinated solvents are fat soluble and thus they accumulate in fatty tissues. This enhances the harm they do. Many are now classified as carcinogens. When the solvents eventually breakdown, they can form new substances that are even more toxic than the original chemical. For instance, methyl chloroform forms highly toxic phosgene gas when burnt. \n Chlorinated solvents in the atmosphere either eventually breakdown in the troposphere or are transported into the stratosphere. Freons (one of the CFCs) contribute to the thinning of the ozone layer. This arises when the stable freons reach the stratosphere where they are broken down by solar radiation, releasing chlorine atoms. This chlorine is very reactive and quickly breaks down the surrounding ozone. A single chlorine atom can breakdown several hundred ozone molecules. The other chlorinated solvents that reach the stratosphere are broken down in the same way as CFCs and have the same direct effect on the ozone layer. \n Chlorinated solvents also contribute to the rise in global temperature i.e.. the 'Greenhouse Effect'. Although carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas, chlorinated hydrocarbons are also important. They absorb a different type of heat radiation, contributing to overall global    warming   \n When chlorinated solvents breakdown in the atmosphere they contribute to the formation of hydrochloric acid which adds to acidification of rainwater and soil. Hydrochloric acid is ranked as the third most important cause of acidification after sulphur and nitrogen. It has been calculated that present global emissions of chlorinated hydrocarbons yields at least 2 million tons of hydrochloric acid per year. Hydrochloric acid also has the ability to form microscopic drops in the air and this can contribute to the formation of \"smog\". \n The effects of chlorinated solvents are thus well documented. Sooner or later, 100 <*> per cent sign </*> of the solvents used enters the environment - either in pure form, or as breakdown products, or after reacting with other substances. They affect humans, animals and plants. In order to prevent environmental problems, a complete understanding of how toxins are formed and spread is of critical importance. This would require that the paths of all substances from production, transport, use and disposal be known. This would make it easier to find the sources of toxic contamination, and to take measures to prevent emissions to the environment and to find suitable alternatives. \n Increasingly for most uses of chlorinated solvents, there are alternative processes and products that are more acceptable from an ecological viewpoint. Alternatives can be divided into 3 groups - chemical alternatives, process alternatives and system alternatives. \n The principle of chemical alternatives is to find chemicals to do the same job, but without the disadvantages of the currently used chemicals. Some chlorinated solvents can be replaced by a natural substance;- water, our most common solvent. The largest industrial use of chlorinated solvents is degreasing. Replacements based on natural substances such as alcohols are available. Among consumer products, white correction fluid, e.g.. \"Tipp-Ex\" is a good example of a product for which there is an alternative - water for the currently used 1.1.1. trichloroethane. In industry, chlorine based bleaches can be replaced by less harmful hydrogen peroxide. \n Replacing a chemical in a process often calls for the process to be adapted. The purpose of the process remains the same. Choosing the right process alternative may sometimes make the use of solvents unnecessary. For paint removal, mechanical grinding or blasting can render harmful chemicals redundant. The use of chlorinated solvents in the dry-cleaning industry could be reduced with redesigned machines using other cleaners where water-soluble cleaners don't do the job. To avoid the use of chlorinated solvents in degreasing, laser techniques can replace metal working processes such as die stamping and machining which gives rise to the need for the use of the chemicals. \n System alternatives arise in the case where the purpose of the process or product is questioned. The solution to the environmental problem is to see that the demand for the process ceases. The paper industry is a good example. Increased use of recycled paper is often seen as the aim of environmentalists. This is, however, only one issue in a complex problem. \n Increasingly European recycling companies are turning to hydrogen peroxide for bleaching of secondary paper fibre. This has little environmental impact. There is growing acceptance that brilliant white paper is not required for all purposes. This trend is consumer led. As far as the paper industry is concerned it represents only a small step towards clean technology. There will inevitably be growing awareness of the problems associated with the current paper industry processes. This coupled with awareness of the existence of ecologically sound alternatives will lead to a growing demand for \"Clean Technology\" from the paper industry, i.e., a paper industry that does mot produce dangerous waste. The paper industry is, however, not to be regarded in isolation. The global threat to the environment requires that this concept be applied to all industries Decision makers, internationally, nationally and locally will be responsible to bring this about before it is too late. Public opinion made aware of the issues involved by environmentalists and others will expect it and demand that pollution threats be eliminated at source. \n Recycled paper is promoted as it reduces the demand for virgin wood, and the need for vast mono-culture plantations of suitable trees. It can also contribute to the problems of waste disposal by reducing the quantity of waste to be disposed of. There are, however, a number of environmental problems associated with paper production which are overlooked in the recycling debate.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "8a2f606d-6dda-4ace-9601-ca3e8577f7f4", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.599110+00:00"}
{"text": "<Particle flow>\n\n\n<$A>\n<$B>\n<$C>\n  Measurements in the separation region of a gas-particle cross flow  \n  Introduction  \n Particle-laden flows occur in many engineering applications and are of particular interest in the solid fuel combustion systems associated with fluidised bed reactors. In regions beyond the splash zone, the flow environment in these systems is a dilute suspension of fine solids, particularly in circulating fluidised bed units. The presence of solid particles influences the convective heat transfer, as has been observed in pipe flows by Depew and Kramar (1972) and Sukomel et al. (1976), with increases in Nusselt number noted for fine particles. Similar findings have been reported for suspension jet flows by Kurosaki et al. (1986) and for cross flow over tubes in the first row of a staggered array by Murray and Fitzpatrick (1991). In both cases, enhancement was attributed to an increase in the thermal capacity for the suspension flows with some contribution from boundary layer changes. Murray and Fitzpatrick (1991) report different results for the second and later rows in the tube array, where decreases in the local Nusselt number were considered to be due to changes in boundary layer separation and turbulence characteristics due to the particles. The present work investigates the influence of particles on the boundary layer characteristics in the near separation zone for single cylinders and arrays of cylinders in cross flow.\n Particles are known to modify the turbulence of a carrier phase, and papers by, among others, Hinze (1971) and Owen (1969) have shown which fundamental parameters are most likely to influence the interaction, with factors such as particle Reynolds number and relative (particle to fluid) time and length scales determining the nature of the change. Much of the experimental work on the effect of particles on flows has been for either jet or pipe flows. For jet flows, a detailed review of relevant work and of the techniques appropriate for measurement of two phase flow characteristics has been given by Hardalupas et al. (1989). The experimental data reported indicate that the particle phase caused a decrease in the rate of decay of centre-line gas velocity and increased the local turbulence. The decrease in velocity was attributed to particle to gas momentum transfer and the higher turbulence to an increase in the mean rate of strain. The characteristics of suspension flows in ducts or pipes have been investigated by Lee and Durst (1982), Tsuji et al. (1984) and Liljegren and Vlachos (1990). From these, depending on flow conditions and particle size, the turbulence intensity either increased or decreased and a flatter mean velocity profile was observed for the carrier phase with higher velocities close to the wall. For some cases, the velocity profile exhibited maxima at locations intermediate between the wall and the centreline. Thus, without conducting experiments, it is difficult to predict the specific influence of particles on velocity and turbulence characteristics for many flow configurations.\n The possibility of boundary layer thinning or disruption by particles suspended in a flow was suggested by Boothroyd (1971). Kurosaki et al. (1986) considered this to be the dominant mechanism of heat transfer enhancement in the stagnation region of an impinging jet suspension flow. Kane et al. (1973), on the other hand, suggest that the viscous sublayer in turbulent pipe flows may increase by extending the range of near laminar flow due to turbulence suppression by the particles. The effect of particles on the characteristics of boundary layer formation on a flat plate was reported by Rogers and Eaton (1989), and their results indicated that for 20 <*> per cent sign </*> mass loading, there was a noticeable suppression in the turbulence intensity of the flow. However, in this study, the boundary layer remained attached, unlike that of a cylinder in cross flow, and possible changes in separation or wake shedding were not considered. Boundary layer measurements have been made in the near separation region of a cylinder in single phase cross flow by Vartry and Currie (1984). The general characteristics of two phrase gas-particle cross flows over a cylinder have been reported by Lambert et al. (1988), but no specific measurements have been reported for the boundary layer near the separation region of a cylinder in cross flow.\n This paper reports the results from a systematic study of the effect of particles on the boundary layer characteristics for a cylinder in cross flow. The measurements were obtained with a single channel LDA system using a pedestal amplitude discrimination technique to enable the characteristics of both the carrier phase fluid and the particles to be determined. Measurement profiles of both mean and rms velocities in the boundary layer region at 85 <*> degree sign </*> to 105 <*> degree sign </*> from the front stagnation point were obtained for two size ranges of particles (45-85 <*> mu </*> -200 <*> mu </*>) at two concentrations. In addition, some results from a study of the effect of particles on the flow around the second row tube in a small tube array model are also presented. \n  2 Experimental set-up  \n 2.1  Test rig  \n The tests were conducted in a closed loop rig with a 80 mm x 80 mm test section and the flow axis orientated vertically as shown in Fig. 1. For the single cylinder tests, a 38 mm diameter cylinder was installed in the centre of the section with the cylinder axis normal to the flow direction. The resulting high blockage ratio was acceptable, since the consequent accelerating mainstream flow is similar to the conditions experienced by the tubes at the front of heat exchanger arrays. Preliminary tests on the flow characteristics upstream of the cylinder indicated a uniform flow distribution with nominally isotropic turbulence. For the measurements in the second row of an array, the same cylinder was used with \"half\" cylinders placed upstream and downstream with a triangular pitch of 2.0, as shown in Fig. 1. (Although for such a configuration, the wake structure of the first row tubes will be somewhat different from a full scale array, the flow characteristics close to the surface of the second row near the separation region are quite similar.) The cylinder was polished to produce a mirrored surface to minimise optical noise effects encountered when measuring near surfaces. The laser, together with the transmitting the receiving optics, were mounted on a three dimensional traversing mechanism with a locational accuracy of <*> plus minus sign </*> 10 <*> mu </*> in the horizontal plane. The laser, together with the transmitting and receiving optics, were mounted on a three dimensional traversing mechanism with a locational accuracy of <*> plus minus sign </*> 10 <*> mu </*> in the horizontal plane. The laser orientation was normal to the plane shown in Fig. 1. Measurements were obtained for five positions at 85 <*> degree sign </*> to 105 <*> degree sign </*> from front stagnation. Initially, flow seeding of 1 <*> mu </*> was obtained using a DANTEC 55L18 seeding generator. After some preliminary tests, this seeding was found to cause agglomeration of the larger particles. In order to alleviate this, smoke from incense was used to seed the air. Comparative tests performed showed no difference between the results obtained for this method and those from the seeding generator. Spherical glass beads of nominal sizes 45-85 <*> mu </*> and 100-200 <*> mu </*> were used. The particles were introduced into the flow from a hopper located upstream of the test section and collected in a cyclone. Flow visualisation using a laser sheet technique showed that the particles were uniformly distributed at entry to the test section.\n 2.2  LDA configuration and measurement system  \n The laser Doppler system consisted of a 32 mW He-Ne laser operating in forward scatter. The optical arrangement consisted of a Bragg cell with 120 mm focusing and 350 mm receiving lenses and a photomultiplier which was aligned at 5-10 <*> degree sign </*> off-axis. The optics were aligned to monitor the velocity in the direction tangential to the cylinder surface, but the measurements were obtained in the horizontal plane rather than normal to the cylinder surface due to difficulties in aligning the traversing system. Although this leads to some small discrepancies in the data, except at 90 <*> degree sign </*>, the emphasis of the work at present is to measure differences in the behaviour of single and two phase gas-particle flows close to the cylinder surface and these differences will not give rise to significant variations. Specific details of the set-up are given in Table 1. Signal processing of the Doppler signal was performed using a TSI 1980B counter interfaced to an IBM XT computer. A schematic of the LDA and signal processing arrangement is shown in Fig. 2. \n In order to discriminate between the carrier and the particle phases, the principle of pedestal amplitude filtering as used by Lee and Durst (1982) and by Levy and Lockwood (1981) was adopted. The tests required the use of a Bragg cell, since zero and negative velocities were anticipated. A robust but simple electronic filter/discriminator system was constructed and installed between the photomultiplier and the downmixer. The photomultiplier signal was passed to both a control line and a relay line. On the control line, the signal was low pass filtered to removed the Doppler frequency and the then input to a threshold detector operating on signal rise time. When this was above a present critical value, a pulse was generated to the relay line to eliminate the signal. Thus, only Doppler signals pertinent to the carrier phase were passed to the downmixer. Conversely, when only information on the particle phrase was required, the control line was switched out and the gain and threshold levels on the photomultiplier and counter respectively set such that signals from the carrier phase were not detected. A line diagram of the discriminator system is given in Fig. 3.\n  3 Evaluation of measurement uncertainty  \n 3.1  Boundary layer  \n The first uncertainty to be accounted for is the locational accuracy by which measurements can be obtained in a boundary layer of thickness of the order of 1 mm. Surface location was achieved at each position from the front stagnation point using a visual technique which involved setting the laser at 1 - 2 <*> degree sign </*> to the axis of the cylinder. The laser was traversed towards the surface until the spots intersected to form a measuring volume on the surface. The first measurement for the carrier phase was then obtained at 100 <*> mu </*> from the surface thus located. In some instances, it was not possible to obtain results for the particle phase close to the surface. \n In addition to the usual errors inherent in laser Doppler measurements, two additional problems arise when measuring in the boundary layer in the near separation zone. The first is that of velocity gradient biasing and is a problem encountered in all measurements using LDA in flows where velocity differences occur across the measuring volume. It has been indicated by Vartry and Currie (1984) that biasing will be negligible if the ratio between the diameter of the measuring volume and the thickness of the boundary layer is less than 1 - 30. For the set-up used in the present work, the smallest expected value for the latter was of the order 1 mm with a measuring diameter of 80 <*> mu </*> resulting in a minimum ration of 1 to 12.5. As a consequence, gradient bias errors might be expected to influence the results. Near the surface, the effect of velocity gradient bias is to cause a positive skew characteristic to the velocity histogram whereas at the outer edge of the boundary layer, a negative skew is apparent. In both cases, the rms value of velocity will be increased. The second problem arises as a consequence of the time averaging procedures used to obtain the velocity histograms and is evident in regions where the wake fluctuations cause an unsteady velocity characteristic to be superimposed on the mean flow and turbulence characteristics. Although corrections can be applied to data to account, to some extent, for these effects, in this work the differences in the \"raw\" boundary layer characteristics caused by the presence of a solid phase in the flow have been studied. It will be evident from the results obtained that the effects of these errors on the observed changes in flow characteristics are not significant.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "7b9ab495-dc76-48b2-b08c-da4f8a9c7256", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.600175+00:00"}
{"text": "<Case-based reasoning>\n\n\n<$A>\n<$B>\n  Complexity of Adaptation in Real-World Case-Based Reasoning Systems  \n  1 Introduction  \n Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is a reasoning method that uses experiential knowledge, in the form of cases, to solve problems. When faced with a new problem a CBR system will retrieve a case that is similar, and, if necessary, adapt it to provide the desired solution. Its current popularity as a problem solving paradigm is representative of the shift that has occurred in automated problem solving research; researchers are beginning to move from simple, \"toy\" domains to complex, real world domains. With this move has come a recognition of the many inadequacies of traditional problem solving approaches, and assumptions previously deemed reasonable have proved invalid in complex, dynamic real world domains. Case-based reasoning methods have proved useful in dealing with many of these problems and have had considerable initial success in real world problem solving endeavours.\n Researchers have organised problem solving into three main classes. In order of increasing complexity, these are:  simple, routine,  and  innovative . Simple problem solving activities are characterised by domains whose simplicity facilitate solution generation in a fairly straightforward fashion; there is a relatively direct inference path from problem specification to problem solution. With routine problem solving, domains are more complex and often incomplete, problem specifications are conceptually quite distant from their solutions, and additional computational expense is incurred due to conflicts between dependent domain objects. The most difficult activity, innovative problem solving, is identified by patchy domain models, intricate solution paths through the problem-space, and a considerable amount of backtracking due to interaction problems. \n The aim of this paper is to characterise the relationship between case-based reasoning and problem solving tasks of differing complexity. This relationship is discussed in detail in the next sections. Sections three, four and five solidify this discussion by introducing three real CBR systems concerned with simple, routine, and innovative problem solving. \n  2 Problem Solving Complexity and CBR  \n Our perspective on problem solving is concerned with search-based problem solving techniques. Such problem solvers search a space of \"world models\" or \"problem states\" (the problem-space) to find one in which all the problem goals have been achieved (the goal state). Search proceeds through the problem-space by the application of state-transforming operators. The task of the problem solver is then to find some sequence of operators that transform the initial state into the goal state. The complexity and cost of automated problem solving is well studied and there are many ways that it can be estimated. The classic measure is the amount of search which has to be carried out in developing a solution to a problem. \n Essentially, there are two search related problems associated with conventional problem solving methods. The first, which we term the  operator chaining problem   1 , is basically the problem of searching forward through the problem-space to find the appropriate sequence (chain) of operators with which to solve the target problem. Relieving this problem has been (and still is) the objective of much research and has resulted in a range of relatively successful techniques (e.g. heuristic search, hierarchical planning, least commitment strategy, goal regression etc. ). Further computational complexity arises from the  operator conflict problem   2 . As a planner interacts with its domain it receives a stream of conjunctive goals. Were these goals independent of one another the cost of problem solving would be linear with the number of goals. The reality is somewhat different. Operator conflicts can result in unfavourable interactions between goals. Under such conditions the problem solver must backtrack over earlier work in order to plan a new solution which avoids these interactions. If somehow the problem solver could learn specific sequences of actions that overcome interaction problems in certain situations, the cost per goal could be reduced in the long run. \n Case-based reasoning methods attempt to address both of these problems. By constraining the problem-space search, it reduces the operator chaining problem; the retrieval of a similar case constitutes a considerable 'jump' into the problem space thereby eliminating many potential routes from the search. Furthermore, CBR is potentially a more efficient constraint method than conventional approaches (e.g. heuristic evaluation etc.) whose scope is more local, pertaining to individual problem space states rather than whole areas. Backtracking due to bad interactions may also be avoided, thereby relieving the operator conflict problem. Effectively, cases can be viewed as 'canned' solutions where operator conflicts have been resolved in certain well defined situations As long as the retrieved case is sufficiently similar to the target relatively few conflicts should arise due to modifications made during adaptation. \n  An Overview of CBR    In CBR, problem solving knowledge is characterised as a set of episodes each representing the solution to a specific problem situation. A new problem (the  target ) is solved by retrieving a similar episode ( base case ) from memory, and its solution is then modified to conform with the target situation. Cases are represented by features and relationships and case retrieval depends on matching these case representations. It can be seen from the following description of the stages in CBR that the retrieval stages is a two stage process:- \n   Representation: : Cases are represented by features and operators (relationships). The features may be surface or abstract features and typically the more predictive features will be selected for indexing. \n   Base Filtering   : A small number of candidate episodes which are considered contextually similar to the target situation are selected from the case base. The case base will often be organised as a discrimination network (D-net) to facilitate this. \n   Case Selection / Mapping  : This second stage will select a case from this candidate set based on a more detailed comparison of the cases. A mapping between the base and target cases may also be produced at this stage. \n   Adaptation   : Once the best case from the case base has been selected it must be adapted to fit the problem in hand. In the simplest situations, for instance diagnosis, this adaptation may be trivial and the base case may apply without modification. Adaptation may be very complex in more difficult problem domains, e.g. non routine design. \n   2.2 A CBR Perspective on Complexity   Earlier we introduced the notion of a number of types of problem solving: simple, routine, and innovative. In fact, we can view these as a continuum of problem solving tasks (Figure 1) organised in terms of computational complexity. As illustrated, the relative contribution of the operator chaining and operator conflict problems varies across this continuum. Due to the simplicity of their domains, simple problem solving tasks incur the bulk of their cost from the operator chaining problem; the lack of domain complexity leads to few conflicts so little time is spent backtracking. At the other end of the continuum, the complexity of the domains of innovative problem solving tasks results in the operator conflict problem being very prominent (and expensive to resolve), with proportionately less time spent on the operator chaining problem. \n<%> Figure 1 </%>\n The basic tenet of CBR is that, rather than solve a problem from first principles, it may be easier to retrieve a similar problem and transform the solution to that problem. In Figure 2 we attempt to illustrate these trade-offs graphically. SP' represents the specification for a new problem and SL' is the solution to that problem. FP' represents the search process that establishes this solution from first principles - the task we wish to avoid. A CBR solution is worthwhile if the retrieval task R, and the adaptation task A are simpler than FP'.\n\n In the later sections of this paper we will examine three CBR systems that differ in the complexity of the transformation task A:- \n   Substitution Adaptation:   : This is the simplest type of adaptation and merely involved substituting some of the parameters in the solution. \n   Transformational Adaptation:   : This adaptation is more complex and will involve structural changes to the solution.\n   Generative Adaptation:  : This is the most complex adaptation and is not perfectly represented by the diagram. The adaptation process involves a rework of the reasoning process FP in the context of the new problem situation represented by SP'.\n From a case-based reasoning perspective there is a relationship between the complexity of the problem solving task and the complexity of the CBR adaptation process. CBR systems concerned with simple problem solving tasks will typically require simple, substitutional adaptation; the retrieved case will typically be very close to the target and consequently will require only very basic substitutive adaptation, with little or no chance of bad interactions occurring. With routine problem solving tasks, the retrieved case, while being similar to the target, will probably require substantial modification possibly changing some structural elements of the retrieved solution (transformational adaptation), and innovative problem solving tasks extensive modifications are necessary during adaptation so interactions are unavoidable and difficult to resolve. To accommodate this adaptation complexity it is generally necessary to augment cases with detailed knowledge such as the reasoning trace structures of Carbonell 's Derivational Analogy. \n  3 Rachman: Substitutional Adaptation  \n Simple problem solving tasks are characterised by well-defined domain models, and a relatively direct inference path from problem specification to problem solution. Case-based reasoning methods are particularly well suited to such tasks as there is often a rich set of cases to draw upon during problem solving. The retrieved case is typically very similar to the target problem and consequently the adaptation problem is relatively uncomplicated; in general modifying the attributes of solution elements will suffice without the need to change the overall solution structure. \n\n   3.1 A Brief Overview of Rachman   Figure 3 shows two example cases from a case-based system called Rachman that can predict the selling value of a house given some details about it. The system contains a large case base of houses and their selling prices and, given a house description, it will retrieve a case or a set of cases describing similar houses and their selling prices. These prices can be adjusted depending on differences between the target and base cases to estimate the price of the target house. This system is comparatively straightforward but is equivalent to a host of potential CBR applications, for example loan risk assessment and help-desk assistants. The complexity of this problem is greatly reduced by having a well populated case base, so that good matches can be found and the required adaptation is not difficult.\n The cases are divided into two sets of features, the index features and the internal features. The index features are the most strongly predictive features and form the basis for the D-Net (Figure 4). The main problem with the D-Net approach is that it forces a strict ordering of the index features, in this example the cases might be organised first under location, then number of bedrooms, etc. However, different users may have different priorities; some, for instance, might consider the number of bedrooms to be more important than location. In addition, it will not be possible to retrieve matches for cases that have missing features as the retrieval process will not be able to search below the level of that feature in the network.\n These problems are largely solved by introducing redundancy into the D-Net. This means that the network supports alternative orderings on the index features (see Figure 4). The extent to which redundancy can be introduced into the network is limited because the size of the network grows in proportion to the number of orderings supported. Retrieval in Rachman returns clusters of cases and the cases are ranked according to their frequency of occurrence in these clusters. \n\n   3.2 Substitutional Adaptation in Rachman   It is assumed with this system that the case base is well populated so that near or exact matches can be found. This means that the adaptation is comparatively straightforward using substitution specialists that adjust the price based on differences between the base and target cases. For instance a substitution specialist may add or remove the value of having a conservatory. The important point is that the effect of this adjustment is quite local and does not cause complex interactions.\n  D&/ej&\\a Vu: Transformational Adaptation  \n In a CBR system for routine problem solving, retrieved cases, while being comparatively similar to the target, will probably require substantial structural modification. Consequently a limited opportunity exists for bad interactions to occur. Carbonell (Carbonell, 1983) characterises such problem solvers as belonging to the realm of     Transformational   Analogy . Essentially, the adaptation stage can be considered as a solution transformation problem. Finding the appropriate transformation is itself a problem-solving process, but in a different problem space. The states of this transformation-space (T-space) are problem solutions, as opposed to solution states. The transformation-space operators (T-operators) are atomic solution transformation operators (e.g., Substitute Solution Step, Delete Solution Step, Insert Solution Step, Reorder Solution Steps). And the job of adaptation is to find the appropriate sequence of T-operators which will transform the retrieved solution into the desired target solution (See Figure 5).", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "bf1871fd-70b0-49eb-8021-d393321b3292", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.601086+00:00"}
{"text": "<Offshore oil>\n\n\n<$A>\n<$B>\n  OFFSHORE ENGINEERING  \n  Gerard Keane  \n   1. INTRODUCTION   \n The Marine environment poses many complex and varied problems to the offshore industry, including offshore production and exploration operators, i.e. the oil industry, design companies and offshore Certification Authorities.\n In order to safely, efficiently and economically produce hydrocarbons from offshore oil and gas fields, it is becoming more and more essential to develop a clear definition of the forces expected to exist at the various offshore locations in which production and exploration systems are expected to work. \n Oil price ultimately determines the viability of an offshore find. A field may be considered 'Marginal' if the environmental conditions on site, along with the predicted economical return from the reserves, necessitate a close examination of Capital Expenditure, i.e. the cost of the production/exploration unit, operating costs, i.e. transportation of the hydrocarbons, maintenance and repair costs and eventual abandonment costs, in order to determine if, in fact, the proposed development does produce an economical return to the oil operator. \n Downtime due to environment may be as high as 30 <*> per cent sign </*>. The resulting loss in production may render a 'Marginal Field' a failure in terms of expected revenue. \n Design companies place great importance on accurate knowledge of the environment, in order to develop systems appropriate to their proposed locations. Certification Authorities need to ensure also that proposed new systems, and those systems already operating, are safe, in terms of personnel and in terms of ensured continuity of supply. \n This paper will examine the various aspects of offshore production and exploration activities which are prone to environmental influences, and will comment    on   the means undertaken to ensure that all available efforts are made to minimise or avoid adverse results from environmental conditions prevailing at offshore locations. \n   2. ENVIRONMENTAL DATA AT EOLAS   \n EOLAS has collected wave, wind and current data over many years to assist in its role as Irish Certifying Authority. These data have been collected directly by EOLAS, for example, at the Kinsale Head Production Platform Alpha, with the assistance of Marathon Petroleum Ireland, Ltd., using a programmable data acquisition system. This system collected wave data, concurrently with structural deflection data. The project in question was carried out on behalf of the European Commission.\n Other data were obtained from other oil companies carrying out exploration work in the Irish offshore.\n A third set of data is that set collected from observations made by ships of passage over approximately 100 years. Such data have been statistically analysed to provide maxima, percentage exceedence and other useful parameters. \n A    fourth   set is of an analytical nature, i.e., derived wave data produced by modelling of causative winds. Two models have been accessed, the Irish Meteorological Analytical Wave Model and the UK Meteorological Office Fine Mesh Wave Model. These models use atmospheric pressure data, resulting winds, to create a derived wave file with directionality. The computer produced a grid-wise printout which is referred to actual geographical co-ordinates, thus providing a further independent validation of all other wave data sources. \n EOLAS was an Associate Member of NESS, The North European Storm Study, which aimed to standardise European analytical models, or at least to define the differences. The various models are either owned by Government bodies such as meteorological offices or by research organisations. EOLAS wave archives were made available to the study, for use as validation files against the analytical outputs.\n All data are available to assist in the accurate determination of structural behaviour in, at times, quite adverse conditions. \n The following four sheets detail the extent of data collected to date. These data are augmented whenever new information becomes available. \n   3. FIXED PRODUCTION PLATFORMS   \n Fixed production platforms are structures permanently installed in hydrocarbons producing fields. These structures remain in place over the economical life of the field and are varied in design. Following is the most prevalent type. \n\n Steel space frame jackets, supporting production and accommodation topsides. These structures consist of a bracing arrangement, from seabed to sea surface, supporting the topsides which contain process equipment, utilities and accommodation. The main legs of these structures are piled into the seabed.\n The support structure is termed the platform jacket, and is described as space frame, in that minimum steel is used to as to present minimum resistance to sea forces, caused by waves and currents. The greater the steel surface presented to the sea, the greater the resulting stresses imposed on the structure. The environmental factors considered in the design of the support structure are: Seabed currents Surface currents Waves Winds \n Currents cause a semi-constant force to act on the structure, and are the main consideration at lower depths. \n Waves act at the upper portion of the jacket and are critical to fatigue action. The magnitude, direction and frequency of wave action has to be known to an accurate extent in order to predict the future life of the structure. Structural analysis and reanalysis is an ongoing responsibility for engineers.\n The results of annual structural inspections are compared with predicted behaviour. Any changes in structural integrity are fed into powerful analysis packages to determine if any defects are of major concern. If so, then repair has to be undertaken, either resulting in grinding out of the defect or clamping of the braces leading into the node with the defect.\n The following are the factors examined in general when carrying out a structural analysis: Corrosion allowance for the steel Wave loading directions for the location Water depth Current velocity at depths throughout the structure Wave magnitudes and angles of incidence Topsides loadings \n All of the above lead to a determination of remaining fatigue life for all the nodes, joints, of the space frame structure.\n   Topsides.   Topsides are subject to wind loading, which in turn leads to an overturning moment on the jacket support. Crane operations are carried out only when wind conditions are below a critical threshold. \n   4. FLOATING PRODUCTION SYSTEMS   \n Floating production systems are, by their nature, susceptible to the environment. This type of production system was developed as a requirement for marginal field exploitation, for example, or in the case where extreme water depth made the more conventional steel jacket impractical.\n Floating production systems are either purpose built, e.g., semi-submersible type, or converted vessels, e.g., converted tanker. Operations associated with this type of production are susceptible to environmental influences, where extremes can lead to detrimental consequences, in terms of safety, in terms of damage to the environment, and in terms of lost production.\n Marginal field development depends on a determination of all factors influencing the final return on investment. One of the main factors influencing output target is environmental downtime, which can be as high as 30 <*> per cent sign </*>, experienced at certain Northern Sea fields using floating production.\n A semi-submersible production system is connected to the seabed wellhead via a riser and conductor system. The riser transports the hydrocarbon from the reservoir to the unit. The unit, whereas compliant to seastate in a free floating mode, will have restricted movements when connected to the seabed. This is necessary to maintain stress on the piping to an acceptable maximum. Motion limits in heave, pitch, roll, etc., are necessary to minimise stress and bending of the connecting pipework. \n EOLAS has been developing a lost-production analysis package since 1987. This package, Downtime Analysis for Marginal Field Production Systems (DAMPS), was developed in co-operation with The European Commission. The package simulates production operations in conjunction with the environmental parameter file for the location and determines downtime caused by conditions above the operating criteria of the various aspects of the operation, e.g., riser/conductor connect/disconnect levels, transport tanker mooring/unmooring levels, production tanker hawser tension limits. \n Earlier stages of the work consisted basically of a direct actual environment versus environmental limits comparison. It was considered appropriate to develop the package further to allow comparison between actual structural behaviour and motion limits. Model testing was carried out in UCC's Hydraulics and Maritime Research Centre and at The Danish Hydraulics and Maritime Institutes. Resulting response amplitude operators for various production unit shapes in various seastates were provided to EOLAS to allow conversion from the basic wave data file, for example, to the derived structural response file. The resulting package is now more relevant to offshore personnel, who feel more confident in comparing motion characteristics with motion limits than in studying seastates. \n The above analysis routine is applicable to areas other than specifically offshore. Following are examples of areas where downtime analysis can produce cost effective results: Marine works Harbour construction crane vessels Dredging Interconnector power cable installation Fish farm design Oil pollution contingency plans, oil boom choice Seismic exploration vessels Safety/standby vessels \n The above are but a few of the areas where EOLAS ' downtime analysis package can assist in identifying the most appropriate and cost effective vessel for the project. By choosing a vessel whose performance matches as closely as possible with predicted conditions on site, cost effective marine operations can be realised, and even if the appropriate vessel is more expensive to hire, the resulting uptime most often saves cost over the duration of the project.\n   EXPLORATION UNITS   \n Over the last ten years, approximately 50 wells have been drilled offshore Ireland, using 22 exploration units. These wells were drilled in areas of extreme environmental activity, e.g., West Coast Porcupine, and in areas of a more benign climate, e.g., Irish Sea. In each case, the rig chosen for the work was considered suitable in terms of economics and the technical ability to carry out the task.\n There exist many varieties of drilling unit. The most common seen offshore Ireland in the semi-submersible unit, which is floated to location and anchored on site. Subsequent ballasting minimises the effects of wave action and provides a relatively stabilised drilling floor. \n Another type of unit is the drillship, often a converted tanker. Such a unit is more appropriate to calmer conditions.\n A third unit seen offshore Ireland is the jack-up rig, which is floated to site and then stabilised on the seabed foundation using steel bracing of solid legs which are cranked downwards to the sea floor, thus allowing the unit hull to be raised out of the water.\n All of the above have operating limits, similar to the floating production units considered earlier.\n EOLAS has used the DAMPS package to assist oil companies determine the most suitable unit from an environmental uptime perspective.\n Environmental suitability is then added to the assessment list, which will include actual unit hire costs, to allow the operators decide acceptable downtime risk in the light of the overall cost of the unit.\n Obviously, a unit with high environmental criteria, i.e., a unit which is likely to continue operating under highly adverse conditions, will have little or no downtime, but will also most likely be the more expensive of the options being considered. \n An assessment by EOLAS on the probably conditions on site during the drilling programme, assists the final decision. Environmental assessment is made from the knowledge of previous years for the proposed location.\n To provide future information, weather data collected by the rig crew during a drilling season if often passed on to EOLAS to augment existing archives. Thus, a rapport has developed over the years between EOLAS and the oil companies/drilling unit owners. Contact is maintained with the operator during the well to allow comparison between predicted rig behaviour and actual motions experienced.\n The aim of this process is to help confirm the accuracy of the study and also, where necessary, to fine tune the software even further to best reflect the information requirements of the offshore crews. Quite often, different drilling companies, i.e., those companies who lease rigs to the oil operators, may have different methods of determining environmental suitability. Even though we are dealing with similar seas, rigs will respond differently dependent on their makeup and original designs. For example, one rig may have a more accommodating conductor/riser slip joint arrangement than its neighbour. Heave compensation may be more effective on one rig than on another.\n The EOLAS package takes all these specifics into consideration, thus simulating the actual unit as closely as possible.\n The overall aim of this type of study is to identify the most suitable rig for the well to be drilled.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "35066e33-73bb-4d13-8087-70b32a718e35", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.602135+00:00"}
{"text": "<Cultural issues>\n\n\n<$A>\n  OUT OF STEP  \n  P&/ol O Muir&/i  \n  A report on the Irish language published last month by the Committee on the Administration of Justice is the latest to argue that the right to speak Irish should be a civil one, not a government favour.  \n The CAJ calls upon the British government to sign the European Charter for Regional or Minority Language and adopt a more positive policy towards the Irish language,  \"as it has toward the two other living Celtic languages in the United Kingdom, Welsh and Scots Gaelic\" . The charter, adopted in June 1992 by a substantial majority of the ministers ' deputies of the Council of Europe, offers a bill of rights for speakers of minority and regional languages. \n The report 's conclusion is measured, intelligent and reasonable, and contains much which Irish speakers would support. Yet it is very unlikely the government will implement even a fraction of the recommendations. \n The charter, says the CAJ, guarantees the right to use minority languages in the public sphere - in schools, in courts, in dealings with administrative authorities and public services, and in economic and social life. It reflects the latest thinking in the international human rights community on linguistic rights, as a facet of minority rights. And its  \"proactive\"  approach is a useful tool for the Irish language community in pressing for government support. \n  \"The history of discrimination faced by the Irish language merits and appropriate response from the government. The European Charter provides a mechanism for beginning to redress the complaints of Irish language activists. It would also keep the British government in step with its European partners,\"  the report says. \n Yet this government is not much bothered about keeping in step with Europe. Its attitude remains to do as little as possible, as seldom as possible. It has still to rescind the Miscellaneous Provisions Act, which prohibits erection of Irish street signs - and is in no rush to do even that. \n The Northern Ireland Office stresses its support for Irish-language education. But practitioners retail countless stories of prevarication and uninterest from government bodies, who seem intent on moving the goalposts whenever possible. \n Failure to sign the charter would be another example of this indifference - an indifference shared by the Dublin government, which has also yet to sign up. To accept even some paragraphs would, however, be a worthwhile start, proving just how seriously Stormont regards its duty to the Irish language. \n\n\n<$B>\n  TRIAN TELLS THE ARMAGH STORY  \n  Northern Ireland Easter Special by Clare Ogle  \n  EARLIER this month a year-long celebration entitled 'Armagh Together' got off to an auspicious start in the city 's newest tourist development.  \n Appropriately, the launch-pad for this cross-community marketing initiative was St Patrick 's Trian which opened in Armagh 's English Street in October last year. This interpretive centre tells 'The Armagh Story' covering the city 's history from its prehistoric period to the Georgian era. \n Armagh District Council Marketing Assistant, Karen Houlahan, explained the significance of the word Trian (pronounced Tree an). \n  \"In ancient times Armagh was divided into three areas. Trian is Irish for three, and the area where this centre is located was in fact one of those 'trians'. \n \"As well as 'The Armagh Story' which takes the visitor from pre-Christian times to modern day, St Patrick 's Trian also has a children 's fantasy area, The Land of Lilliput, based on Jonathan Swift 's book, Gulliver 's Travels, which was partially written in Armagh.\"  \n The size of the new tourist attraction is deceptive. If approached through the Tourist Information Centre on English Street, it suddenly mushrooms in front of the visitor after passing through the courtyard at the rear of the TIC. Visitors also have direct access to the new centre from the adjacent car park. \n  \"Naturally St. Patrick 's Trian will play a big part in the year-long 'Armagh Together' celebration with over 200 events taking place to commemorate St Patrick coming to Armagh 1,550 years ago. Hence the opening of St Patrick's TRIAN in time for the launch of Armagh Together,\"  said Karen. \n Other characters who played a significant role in Armagh 's history line up to meet visitors at the entrance to 'The Armagh Story'. \n  \"Firstly, we have the life-size figure of John Wesley, founder of the Methodist Church who preached in Armagh many times. He looks quite diminutive, but he was in fact just five feet tall,\"  explained Karen. \n  \"There is also a scribe who would have played an important part in Armagh 's history and Dr William Crolly who was foremost in the construction of the Roman Catholic Cathedral around 1840. The 'modern visitor' figure of the Italian tourist symbolises all of the tourists we hope to welcome to St Patrick 's TRIAN and indeed the whole area. Close to the exhibition entrance is a suitably fierce Celtic warrior, guarding the dolmen tomb which is the starting point for the visitor 's journey to rediscover the story of Belief - the story of Armagh.\"  \n And as we entered the dolmen tomb, thought to have been used for burial purposes, and with audio-visual aids and haunting Clannad-type music, the story of the life and rituals of prehistoric man began to unfold. \n  \"The next chamber contains a model of the original Navan Temple. Navan, in pre-Christian times, was the political and spiritual capital of Ulster. The wrap-around murals tell the story of Navan Fort - Emain Macha - and the mighty Irish warrior, Cu Chulainn,\"  Karen explained. \n In the 5th century AD, St Patrick came to Armagh where local chieftain, Daire, gave him a site on which to build a church. After the chieftain 's own conversion to Christianity, a prestigious hilltop site was granted and this is where the Church of Ireland Cathedral stands today. \n  \"In this next section, the story of St. Patrick, who came to Armagh around 444 AD, is told. Visitors learn of the success and the consequences of his work and of the story of St Patrick and the fawn on the hill where the Roman Catholic Cathedral now stands. We have two cathedrals of course in Armagh, both named after St Patrick. Further along there are excerpts taken from the Book of Armagh which was written around 807. Unfortunately we don't have the Book of Armagh here as it is in Trinity College Dublin, but we do hope to get a replica of it,\"  said Karen. \n In the next chamber, the visitor comes upon scenes of terror as marauding vikings pillage and burn. The impact of viking raids was widely felt during the 9th and 10th centuries with Armagh being destroyed repeatedly. A replica of an ancient Celtic Cross dating from the 11th century (the original can be seen in the Church of Ireland Cathedral) bears witness to scenes of terror as mothers attempt to protect children and monks seek to save church treasures. A wall panel gives details of viking raids carried out in the area. \n The visitor next comes to a series of church windows which light-up in sequence as the story of Armagh moves on through medieval times, the Reformation and finally leads the visitor into present-day Armagh. \n The last life-size character to introduce himself is  \"architect and humble servant\"  Francis Johnston. \n  \"He was responsible for many of the fine Georgian buildings that exits in Armagh today including the impressive Court House which is currently under renovation. Visitors may wonder at his incredibly life-like face with moving mouth and different facial expressions. His 'face' is actually blank and an image is projected onto the model which is really ingenious and quite realistic,\"  said Karen. \n The last sequence of colourful murals pick out other attractions in the area that are worth a visit - Navan Fort, The Palace Stables Heritage Centre, the National Trust properties - The Argory and Ardress House, the Observatory and the Planetarium. \n  \"Incidentally, the Planetarium has two new projects underway - an Astropark which has already opened and the Eartharium which officially opens in July,\"  Karen pointed out. \n As visitors exit 'The Armagh Story' they come to the craft shop, before setting off along the Granary Mall, the full length of which is dedicated to the Allison Collection of historical photographs. Leaving history behind, the Mall leads to the land of the little people, a constructed castle where a gigantic Gulliver recounts his adventures in the Land of Lilliput. \n  \"Children are just so amazed when they see the size of Gulliver in comparison to the tiny Lilliputians,\"  added Karen.  \"They 're completely mesmerised as they listen to this friendly giant tell tales of his adventures with the little people.\"  \n The final port of call for many will probably be the Pilgrim 's Table Restaurant which has a charming conservatory/patio area for al fresco eating on warm days. Notice the marble inlaid plaque marking a visit by Jacques Delours, President of the European Commission on November 3, 1993. \n The EC President was one of the early visitors to St Patrick 's Trian. By mid-February this year 11,000 people had heard 'The Armagh Story' and shared in Gulliver 's adventures. With a packed year ahead celebrating 'Armagh Together' many thousands more are certain to be drawn to the Trian to learn about Armagh's rich heritage.\n\n\n<$C>\n  A CHIP OFF THE OLD . . . \n THE COUNTRY RHYMES OF JAMES ORR \n  THE BARD OF BALLYCARRY 1770 - 1816  \n DAN Quayle can say goodbye to the White House and fade into obscurity safe in the knowledge that he was, after all, correct about the common spud! \n The man who once described a group of Samoans as  \"happy campers\"  and told his supporters that if they did not succeed they ran the risk of failure, thought he was helping out in a school quiz.\n He spelled it POTATOE and squirmed when the world 's media ridiculed him - but it now emerges that the retiring vice-president of the United States got it right. \n In some eyes at least. \n And it is the writings of a once well-loved Ulster poet whose verses are re-published today which may help save Quayle 's face. \n The very first poem in  The Country Rhymes of James Orr  (Pretani Press, <*> pound sign </*> 5.99) is called \"To the Potatoe\" . \n And Orr, a United Irishman who took part in the 1798 Rebellion and then renounced violence, had got the spelling of the vegetable correct - down to the final letter. \n He was writing in the broad Scotch (braid Scotch) which has now been pronounced a lesser-used language by the European Community. \n  \"And it was the folk poets of Ulster who were spelling the word properly,\"  says Dr Philip Robinson of the Ulster Folk Museum, editor of the new edition of the Orr book. \n  \"What happened to change the spelling in the English language later isn't the fault of James Orr or Dan Quayle.\"  \n The politician, George Bush 's sidekick through thick and thin for the past four years, has been sent a copy of the book. \n Philip Robinson and Pretani Press await his comments with interest. \n Perhaps if Dan 's vindication had come a little sooner there might have been a few more votes cast in the direction of the Bush-Quayle camp in the Presidential election! \n There is currently an upsurge of interest in the Ulster-Scots language, particularly among the young of the province who are researching their roots. \n The Ulster-Scots Language Society has been formed - and is flourishing - to give the Ulster-Scots tongue new age respect. \n And an Ulster-Scots dictionary is being prepared which will be introduced into schools along with literature in the language, like the folk poems of Orr. \n Around Carrick, Ballymena, Greyabbey and some other places where Ulster-Scots trips off the tongue easily to this day, the dictionary won't be required. \n Born in a thatched cottage in Ballycarry, Co Antrim, Orr was taught weaving by his father. He wrote his first verses as a boy at Ballycarry Presbyterian meeting house. \n His parents educated their only son at home to ensure a strict Calvinistic upbringing. He wrote a poem called A Parent 's Flinty Heart to express his disapproval of his father and mother 's restrictive views. \n But they couldn't stop him straying into the United Irishmen. \n After the '98 Rebellion young Orr fled across the Atlantic to New England and, like many of his contemporaries, took with him Ulster 's own varieties of the potato (or potatoe?). \n Within a year James was back home. He preferred to be among the people and the places he wrote about. But he did have poems published in America and earned some critical acclaim. ........", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "4f8b83f3-9d91-4c15-a233-fabf8f971e0c", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.603048+00:00"}
{"text": "<History review>\n\n\n<$A>\n Lyke allwaye to contynue? \n  Bruce Stewart  \n  JONATHAN BARDON'S   History of Ulster  serves as a researcher 's vade mecum, and a good read of a very high order. This latter trait, in a comprehensive digest of the social, cultural, and political course of affairs in north-east Ireland from the earliest times, is a notable achievement, even at the expense of handing over the narration of certain events almost entirely to other commentators. Of course there can be no doubt that the book has an ideological agenda, but it remains gracefully indulgent towards alternative readings of the past at variance with the brand of liberal unionism that pervasively informs its chapters. Taking its ground on the political fact of independent (though not sovereign) stateship in Northern Ireland since 1920, and devoting almost exactly half of its 830 pages to the record of that state in various arenas, it reads in places like a vindication of partition. In other places, however, it is a stern indictment of the error of excluding Northern Catholics from civil rights, especially in matters of housing and employment but also in regard to education and political participation - though the damage appears to have been largely self-inflicted by the hierarchy in these latter areas. \n The final impact of this book is to demonstrate that there has been, in practical fact, a separate historical process in Ulster, reflecting the particular m/elange of national and religious elements ensconced there since the plantation period. And since the so-called Peace Process in which the leaderships of &/Eire/Ireland, the United Kingdom and the majority parties in Northern Ireland are now engaged seems to presuppose a recognition of the validity of this premises on all sides, there can hardly be much to criticise about its operations in a history textbook. It is very likely, moreover, that the official participants are all going to school with Headmaster Bardon as of now, and it would therefore be impertinent to regard his  History  as just another tome about 'the Province'. If J. H. Whyte 's last published book, Interpreting Northern Ireland (1990) remains the indispensable guide to arguments and practices among politicians and worker folks on either side of the chief divisions of Ulster society, Bardon 's is the text that draws all such positions into a single narrative. Virtually everything else written about Ulster is more or less partis pris compared with it, and nothing else is really half as witty - though Professor Lee 's mordant account of economic failure in the southern state provides occasion for endlessly sardonic chortles - not all intentional, in view of his recurrent anxiety fits about the missing 'elites' of liberated Ireland. \n Bardon 's  History  offers something like the definitive script of liberal unionist Ulster in our generation. It provides the schedule of information, understandings, even levities, by which intelligent Ulster men and women will be assaying their historical experience for quite some time to come. Ultra-unionists (still more ultra-Protestants) will not find much comfort in it; but liberal unionists will enjoy the fun of seeing Nationalists at their most callow and other Unionists at their most intellectually fossilised. With impressive assurance Bardon tells the story of an Irish region that constitutes itself as a separate historical zone not because of its claim to geographical distinctiveness - give or take a drumlin or two it has none - but because it has provided the setting for an apparently endless series of socio-political disturbances which no Land War or subsequent freedom-fighting shenanigans could resolve. \n The book kicks off in the approved Evansite fashion by insisting on the long-term interaction of various waves of natives and settlers in Ulster from neolithic times down to the present moment - or down, at least, to the American invasion which &/Eamon de Valera officially protested in 1941. All of this is fascinating to the present reviewer who lives some hundred yards from Mountsandel, County Derry, where the Cruitin first feasted on boar and salmon on a steep escarpment above the River Bann. What James Joyce - the unacknowledged master of Irish pluralism - calls  'miscegenations upon miscegenation'  ensued through several millennia, and though a more or less uniform Gaelic culture emerged first and lasted longest in Ulster, the question is posed: why should the migration and emigration of Celts from parts of Scotland (together with their British neighbours) not be regarded as an additional ingredient to the brew rather than an (in)alienable foreign element? And - if that sounds like an own-goal - why should the heterogeneous Gaelic Irish consider themselves radically different from other inhabitants of the British Isles when  \"the genepool of Irish population probably was set by the Stone Age\"  ? \n In such a view,  \" Celtic civilisation was not the creation of a separate race but a language and a way of life spread from one people to another.\"  The tendency of this argument is patently inimical to the pieties of Irish-Ireland history and its notion of a continuous, undivided Irish nation of Gaelic racial origin; nor is it friendly to an imperialist whitewashing of the mixed legacies of a country made up of closely interwoven ethnic and cultural components. At the same time, this pleasant smorgasbord of physical and cultural aggregates does not by any means abolish the underlying problems presented by living Irish history, and kosher Gaelic Catholic nationalism is just not going to go away at the behest of centralised economic and political rationalism streaming outwards along ley-lines    focused   in Whitehall and Westminster. \n There is more than a trace of special pleading in the way Bardon orchestrates selected passages from the Irish annals, from the journals of shipwrecked Spanish Armadeers, dejected Gaelic bards, bemused English administrators, and Irish nationalist historians themselves, in order to portray a politically dysfunctional ancient Irish community in which tribal wars and man-made famines - punctuated by bouts of cannibalism - prevented the passing of the nation over the threshold of modern statehood. It all reads a little like David Hume 's derogatory chapter in the  History of England  , and one almost expects to see Charles O'Connor and Sylvester O'Halloran rising from their graves to dispute such calumnies about their people. But this kind of erudite Gael-bashing is little more than a curtainraiser, and it may even be that the author has struck the very note that will laugh the nationalist historians out of their own earnestness about the glory of God and the honour of Ireland which has been the touchstone of Gaelic historiography since Four Masters. \n Indeed, they too are featured here, or rather their lament at the ill-advised Flight of the Earls whose  'undutifulle departure'  - in the words of an English administrator - provided the excuse for the plantation of Ulster under James I. Such inclusions make for a useful primer in all-Irish history also, and only occasionally does the writing tilt towards undue insistence, as when we hear that Red Hugh O'Donnell  'died of illness'  - as Bardon puts it - in Simancas. O'Donnell was assassinated by poison at the hands of an Anglo-Irishman called Burke, or so the DNB and Standish O'Grady firmly believed and Irish historians after them. It hardly seems fair to airbrush the Ninja quotient out of Anglo-Irish history in order to show that the Gaelic Ireland was an incorrigibly ungovernable society which finally committed suicide out of aristocratic pique when the local rent-roll diminished below the level that the tyrannical native princes '  amour proper  could tolerate. \n In the eighteenth-century chapters we hear much about the failure of nerve of the Protestant Ascendancy in the face of Catholic Emancipation, and of course the stupid exclusion of Presbyterians from citizenship, with obvious consequences in 1798. We also hear the stentorian voice of Burke chanting his marvellous description of the penal laws, a  \"machine of elaborate contrivance as well fitted for the oppression, impoverishment, and degradation of a people, and the debasement in them of human nature itself, as ever proceeded from the perverted ingenuity of Man.\"  We see the birth of the Orange Order, with its early pogrom-type attacks on rural Catholics in Tyrone-Fermanagh. We follow the struggles of the emancipationists, including notably the inept descent of Daniel O'Connell on County Down, where he was met and challenged by Henry Cooke, DD, the man who forged the union that really counts - that between the Presbyterian Synod and the Church of Ireland. By 1857 an interchange of religious and political opinions in Belfast  'on the basis of basalt'  was a regular feature of the riotous scene. This sickening aspect of social and political history in Ulster is traced equitably down the generations, though much - if not most - energy from mid-way in the book goes into the economic narrative of Ulster which is this historian 's particular forte (and this includes the narrative of the war-time air raids on the tragically overcrowded ghetto-slums). All in all, linen, cotton and steel spelt the momentary triumph of the Ulster entrepreneurial class but, in various fatal combinations with religion and tuberculosis, they also wove the cerements of Ulster working class - that unfortunate and profoundly self-destructive class of Irishmen and women. \n A punctilious account of each tawdry phase of sectarian antagonism in Ulster - and in Ireland - since the Act of Union is perhaps the salient feature of this book. It is all done with a high impartiality that makes it clear that Ulster Catholics and Protestants have always reacted to one another in such a way as to join forces only in a downward spiral. Whether reporting the rattle of muskets at the Diamond or the various crawthumping revivalisms of both factions, the tale is told with a sardonic relish for detail that looks forward to good documentary treatment. If so, a leading figure will be Ian Paisley - arguably the premium mobile of the present troubles - who emerges in the chapters that concern him as a barbarian on a footing with the very worst in Ireland 's saga of self-righteous bigots. The moment when, immediately after the death of John XXhe assured his congregation that the scarlet prelate was already roasting in Hell perfectly illustrates the tragicomedy of antediluvian religiosity and its hateful consequences. Equally comic, if not equally tragic, is the prospect of the Catholic hierarchy repudiating the benefits of the Welfare State on behalf of its charges for fear of Creeping Communism. It is to Archbishop Cardinal McRory that the credit goes for broadcasting in a Paschal sermon the view that the Church of Ireland (let alone Ian Paisley) is  'not even a part of the Church of Christ'.  \n The saga of Home Rule, the Ulster Covenant, the Rising, and the establishment of northern and southern statelets is powerfully narrated, with a number of amusing stories indicating the degree to which partition was not only grudgingly accepted but actively engineered by Irishmen of both persuasions in spite of knee-jerk protestations to the contrary. One such protest, cited from James Craig 's journal following his visit to de Valera in Dublin, amusingly encapsulates the element of fantasy-life in the Irish leader 's mental make-up that made it possible for Craig to posture as a modern democrat of some urbanity faced with a political troglodyte. \n  After half an hour he reached the era of Brian Boru. After another half hour he had and advanced to the period of some king a century or two later. By this time I was getting tired. Fortunately, a fine Kerry Blue entered the room . . .  \n Bardon digs particularly deep in his portrayal of Carson (deeper than A. T. Q. Stewart in the Macmillan series), and if Kevin Myers is still in listening-distance, he may note the Dublin Unionist was not the law-abiding pacificist and crypto-socialist that  Irishman 's Diary  has been tempted to suppose:  \" 'Crawford,'  he said decisively to the organiser of the gun-running,  'I 'll see you through this business if I have to go to prison for it.'  \"  \n The one nationalist who shines in Bardon 's narrative - other than many named and unnamed figures who availed of the 1947 Education Act to become administrators, civil servants, entrepreneurs, professionals and poets - is Gerry Fitt, who first vocally insisted on the necessity of recognising the roots of Unionism in a popular way of feeling and sought, accordingly, a political solution to the inter-community strife in the context of the Northern Ireland state. Indeed, Bardon reiterates the Fittite precept more than once in the form of a reproof to leaders north and south.  \"Southern politicians assumed that leaders in the North were responsible for dividing the people there but the roots of sectarianism ran deep in Northern Ireland society\" ; so much for the 'Orange Card' an the British conspiracy theory. He continues,  \"while they [the Ulster Protestant leaders] can be condemned for failing to give a positive lead in promoting reconciliation, such men were merely reflecting views very widely held.\"  None of this of course exonerates those governors of Northern Ireland who advertised and supported principles of outright political prejudice in the government of the Northern state, such as - notoriously - Basil Brooke. Bardon comments:  \"No doubt a sizeable proportion of Catholics would never have been reconciled to the political status quo but the tragedy was that Brookeborough seemed incapable of recognising the benefits of reconciling any of the minority to the regime.\"", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "28c1a31f-0073-4606-a317-26698954b490", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.604050+00:00"}
{"text": "<Embroidery>\n\n\n<$A>\n SHAWLS, FLOUNCES, <*> ampersand </*> BODICES \n The Whitework Tradition of embroidery and needlework \n LINDA M. BALLARD \n To define any kind of needlework as 'traditional' is to imply that it was made by a worker for her own use, according to an established pattern and by a specific technique, both of which were handed on from generation to generation. This definition is perfectly acceptable, but there is a danger in describing any needlework as 'traditional' if it is then assumed that such a description automatically applies. Irish embroidery and lacemaking have recently been authoritatively placed in the context of the Arts and Crafts Movement, which would seem to preclude the possibility of their being defined as 'traditional', at least in the sense outlined above. Yet this term has persistently been applied to many types of local embroidery, and with it has come the inference that the above definition is applicable. To accept this unthinkingly is to do little more than lend spurious authority to a spirit of conservatism, sometimes with absurd results. \n 'Whitework' is a useful blanket term, which may be used to cover any type of decorative needlework, it might be thought in any colour, as long as it is white. In fact, some whitework turns out to be black on a white ground, or vice versa, if black materials are used to interpret techniques more usually worked in white. Some types of whitework are associated with a particular location, so we have Carrickmacross lace, Limerick lace, Clones lace, and Mountmellick work, among others. The unwary will find pitfalls here, and these may be illustrated by reference to Maltese lace. As the name implies, this lace was made in Malta, where, according to various authorities, a certain type of bobbin lace was indigenously made prior to the 1850s. At about this time, the work took a new direction, and the lace patterns began to incorporate the Maltese cross as a design motif. It is this characteristic which is usually taken to identify a certain type of silk, bobbin made lace as Maltese. However, in the 1850s, Maltese lace began to be made in Bedfordshire where the cross was dropped from the design repertoire associated with the lace. Early in the present century, some 'Maltese' lace was being produced here in Ireland. In general, if a style of needlework is referred to by location, this implies that it is made by using a particular technique, perhaps with specific design elements. The technique may or may not have first been used in the locality named. \n 'the unwary will find pitfalls here' \n The fact that Irish lace and embroidery were associated with the Arts and Crafts Movement illuminates a very important point about their production. At least from the early nineteenth century, this in large part was commercially driven. It is an acceptable generalisation, the exceptions to which will later be explored, to say that whitework was produced by women not for their own use, but for the market place, and consequently the aesthetics governing its production were those of contemporary fashion. Trained designers drew patterns which were reproduced and circulated among commercial workers. The Art School in Belfast was greatly concerned to reflect and to train designers to fulfil the needs of local industry. Many Belfast linen manufactures employed trainee designers who while working were given the opportunity to study at the Art School in order to perfect their skills. This concept runs counter to the idea that local embroidery skills were passed unaltered from one generation to the next. To be successful, designs had to keep pace with changes in fashion, and if this process was allowed to lose direction designs were perceived not as traditional but as debased. The resulting product had limited viability. \n 'not as traditional but debased' \n Traditional processes did have a part to play in the transmission of skills. Children, usually daughters, often learned to embroider by observing and being taught by their mothers. \n Gradually, beginning with simple stitches and pattern components, they would be allowed to contribute to their mother 's work. Girls of school age often did their bit to help. Little boys were sometimes involved, especially in helping to prepare fabric for drawnthread embroidery. In some areas, lace and embroidery schools were established. These were places were girls could learn or improve their skills, but schools also had a commercial role. Designs were acquired or even drawn by co-ordinators, work was marketed and workers paid through the schools. Some schools were based in convents, others were organised by able, middle class women for whom entering paid employment was not an option. Many of these women gave their time and energies in a purely charitable capacity, the profits from the work being paid entirely to the workers. These women could also supervise and maintain the standard of the work produced. \n Some of the workers employed through the embroidery schools went there on a daily basis, at least until proficient in their work, but many women worked at home, even if their products were marketed through the school, fitting the embroidery into their domestic schedules as time allowed. Throughout the north of Ireland in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, many women worked through agents, representatives of the large firms, who visited an area on a regular basis. They distributed fabric which had been prepared as necessary, and collected and paid for completed work. The agent could be expected in a specified location at a particular time, and women walked there from their homes carrying fabric to and fro. It is worth remembering that linen can be heavy and bulky if large pieces need to be worked. Sometimes several women would work together to complete a large item, perhaps an intricately decorated bedcover which might be required in a hurry. Stories are even told of women receiving work quickly needed from an agent in morning, and co-operating to have it finished that same day. It seems that some women who possessed very specialised skills occasionally worked on the finest embroideries, so a piece of material might pass from one to another, each contributing her own expertise, so that as many as seven people could be involved in embellishing a cambric handkerchief. \n While many agencies operated in this way, others followed a slightly different pattern, being based in a local shop. In these circumstances, payment was often in goods, rather than cash, despite the dubious legality of such a system. With increasing industrialisation, women began to migrate from the country to Belfast and other centres, where work for embroideresses was available in factory warerooms. \n The fact that designs were predetermined and standards closely monitored often left little creative control to an embroideress. Any satisfaction she could hope to derive from her work came from seeing it completed properly and on time, and perhaps from receiving her pay. Money earned from embroidery was often an important part in family income. Reactions to the work varied. Some women hated it and did it solely as a means of gaining a living. Others derived great pleasure and satisfaction from its beauty. Some were at least occasionally given a measure of creative control, being told the amount they could expect to earn from a given job, but being left to select a suitable pattern to be worked. \n Surviving examples of nineteenth and early twentieth century needlework show a talent and capacity for beautiful work by many local women. A wide range of different types and styles were produced, some changing with time, some being regionalised. As has been discussed, some varieties took their name from an association with a particular area, although they may have been worked in other regions too. Some skills, while not being so named, were particularly if by no means exclusively associated with certain parts of the country. Drawnthread work was very widespread throughout the Mournes, while 'flowering' or 'sprigging' was common in the Ards peninsula and in parts of Co. Donegal. There are technical differences, sometimes substantial, between various types of whitework. Sprigging or flowering usually refers to white embroidery on white linen. As the name implies, the pattern is often floral, or drawn from nature. Typical stitches are raised satin stitch, couching or buttonholing. These terms may also cover other types of design, for example initials worked in this way on handkerchiefs or other items. Some finished pieces may carry several different styles of needlework in combination. \n Early in the nineteenth century, 'Ayrshire work' was produced in many Ulster homes. This type of embroidery was developed in the west of Scotland, and was probably French inspired. It quite quickly spread throughout Ulster, having been introduced, apparently, via the port of Donaghadee. It was characteristically worked not on linen, but on fine muslin. It was most frequently intended for garments for women and infants, and the results it produced are often stunning. Toward the middle of the century it became unfashionable, in part because it began to be possible to produce quite similar work by machine. \n At around the same time another form of white embroidery on cotton was developed in the substantially Quaker town of Mountellick. This was a bold and dramatic type of work, greatly favoured for household textiles. It was stitched on a distinctive, heavy satinised ground known as jean. Religious communities including convents often helped to foster and develop needlework. During the eighteenth century, Moravian women settled in Co. Antrim at Gracehill also found needlework to be a useful means of earning a living. \n The strength of linen fabric made it especially suitable as a ground for drawnthread work, a style of embroidery which involves the removal of bands of thread, either warp or weft, from the ground material. In order to create decorative designs, the remaining threads are worked into and held in place by stitching. Linen was also most suitable for the production of cutwork, superb examples of which were made in the early part of this century by girls at the sewing school organised at the Convent of Mercy in Newry. In work of this sort, the detail and edging of decorative motifs were worked in embroidery and the motifs themselves were then cut out of the linen ground. The pieces were arranged and joined by needlepoint bars or 'brides' of buttonhole stitch. Thus a new decorative textile was effectively created. \n 'an entrepeneur from Nottingham came to Limerick' \n Techniques such as drawnthread work and cut work might with some justification be defined as 'lace', for this is a descriptive rather than a technical word, meaning simply an 'open' fabric. Many types of Irish whitework have been known as lace, and some of these are closely linked to specific regions, often of origin. Two of the best known, Carrickmacross and Limerick laces, owe their existence to the invention of a machine for making net. By the early nineteenth century, this fabric was available as a ground for lace, and an entrepreneur from Nottingham in England came to Limerick, bringing with him a group of women capable of teaching local embroideresses the techniques required to decorate it. Embroidered nets were also being worked in England at this time, but Limerick lace acquired great cachet, so that it is said that sometimes English work might be sold as the product of Limerick. \n Carrickmacross shares certain characteristics with Limerick, but it combines embroidered decoration with applied motifs of fine cambric, or in more recent examples, of organdie. One woman who has designed and made Carrickmacross lace throughout her life recalled that nurses ' falls had been prized as a suitable appliqu&/e fabric when materials became scarce during the Second World War. \n Like Limerick lace, Carrickmacross work was usually made for sale, but while Limerick lacemaking was begun by a businessman, no doubt with an eye to profit, the skills associated with Carrickmacross lace were introduced by the wife of a clergyman, and her motives were charitable. Other local laces have been produced to take advantage of the availability of machine net, but these two are the best known and the most enduring. While they usually feature white threads and fabrics worked over a white net ground, white is sometimes worked on black, or black on white. This combination can sometimes produce a particularly dramatic effect. Black lace was also made, in keeping with nineteenth century fashionable tastes, and more recently some workers have experimented with coloured laces.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "1e6c0f30-7972-4a27-a7d5-f849877cbb69", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.605468+00:00"}

Indeed, an exhibition is planned for the Irish Heritage Centre in New York. \n And eventually copies of all the work produced by the project will be kept at the Ulster Folk Museum. \n Project manager Caroline Bingham explained that the Lower Ormeau and Markets area was chosen for phase one because it was an inner-city area where cross-community links could be strengthened. \n  Contrast  \n  \"The project has three distinct aspects: recording the stories of many working class people, broadcasting and publishing their stories and organising photographic exhibitions.\"  \n Work is now beginning on collecting stories and photos from the Donegall Pass area of the city. A Protestant working class area, it has been chosen deliberately to contrast with the initial phase. \n Next year the group plans to interview people from both sides of the Donegall Road, the Village and the Falls Road ends, to contrast the memories of this mixed area with the previous two. \n  \"Ultimately we want to show both Catholics and Protestants that there is very little difference in their backgrounds,\"  said project worker Anne O'Shea. \n  \"We hope that this realisation that they come from the same backgrounds and experience the same problems will contribute a little to understanding each other.\"  \n Jill McKenna, who compiled the five booklets of interviews, explained:  \"We have aimed with these publication to give ordinary people a platform to talk about their own lives and experiences. It 's history from the bottom up, instead of the usual way from the top down.\"  \n  \"We hope that, taken as a whole, they will give a new insight into the recent history of this fascinating and diverse area, which in itself is a microcosm of the city of Belfast.\"  \n  Community  \n Material gathered through the project has now been incorporated into local school 's history lessons. \n Project worker David Holloway pointed out:  \"Most of the history taught in schools deals with the major political figures, not how life was like for ordinary people living in the community.\"  \n  \"These stories and memories give an insight into how life really was for the people coming from the children 's own areas.\"  \n NICEA was founded in 1984 to promote the need and find funding for community education. \n The funding for the current project has come from the Belfast Action Teams, while Belfast Exposed helped with the photography. \n\n\n<$B>\n  A STORY FROM THE PAST. . .  \n  THE following is an extract from 'Belfast Women - Past and Present', compiled by Jill McKenna, which was one of the five booklets produced in the initial phase of the NICEA project:  \n One of the saddest aspects of \"the old days\" was the treatment meted out to unmarried girls who became pregnant. \n They were condemned by society and seen as a disgrace to their families. Sometimes they were forced into hastily-arranged marriages, and sometimes they were thrown out into the streets to fend for themselves. If they weren't, they were sent away to homes for unmarried mothers or \"fallen women\", where they were made to work hard till their babies were born as a punishment for getting pregnant. Some had their babies in the workhouse. The babies were almost always adopted, often without the mother 's consent. \n If they were lucky, other members of the family were prepared to help them. A widow in her eighties remembered what happened when her cousin, who came from the country, became pregnant. \n  \"When I was fourteen, my mother told me one Saturday that I had to go out the road in a side-car and meet my aunt and cousin.\"  \n  \"My cousin would have her case with her and she was to come back home with me. She didn't give me any reason, but unless you were told you didn\u00abt ask questions. So I did what she said and brought my cousin back and my mother put a single bed in the parlour and put her in there.\"  \n    Her   mother, a widow, took in lodgers to make ends meet. \n  \"When the men were at work, my cousin had the run of the house, but before they came in at five o'clock she had to go into the parlour and stay there. I didn't know why she was kept in there.\"  \n  \"Then one morning about five o'clock I woke up and heard a child crying. I slipped downstairs and I could hear a child crying in our parlour. I didn't know what was going on, but I crept back upstairs, because if my mother had caught me down there she 'd have hit me!\"  \n Unmarried mothers are now a thing of the past. Nowadays they are called single parents, reflecting the more sympathetic and tolerant view of society in general towards unmarried girls who become pregnant. \n Some things at least have changed for the better since a terrified girl was smuggled to the city in a side-car to escape her    father 's   wrath. \n\n\n<$C>\n  HILLSBOROUGH  \n That immaculate little County Down town, owes its origin to Peter Hill, son of Moyses Hill and husband of a sister of the formidable Somhairle Buidhe MacDonnell, cousin and son-in-law of Great Hugh O'Neill. Around 1630 Peter Hill started to build a village and a fort on the site of Hillsborough. These were, however destroyed in 1641, but somewhere in the 1650s Peter 's uncle and heir, Col. Arthur Hill, built an artillery fort on the site. In 1660 it was made a Royal garrison, with Hill and his heirs hereditary Constables. It was not long after this that Hill obtained a charter for his town - from then onwards to be known as Hillsborough. The first Marquess of Downshire (Wills Hill) sponsored Goldsmith 's \"Deserted Village\" and became George III 's Secretary of State for the American Colonies. His successor, the second Marquess, who lived from 1753 until 1801, was a strong advocate of religious toleration and strongly opposed the Union, for which he dearly paid. \n It is to the Marquises of Downshire that Hillsborough owes its English influence. \n William of Orange stayed at the fort on his way to the Boyne in June, 1690, and throughout the years many Royal personages spent time at Hillsborough Castle when it was known as Government House, official residence of the Governor of Northern Ireland. \n The building of this impressive structure was started around 1760 for Wills Hill and was enlarged for the second Marquess of Downshire at the end of the 1700's by Brettingham. Further additions were made to the house in the middle of the 18th century by the architect, William Sandys. A tall column on a high hill, south of the town commemorates the third Marquess of Downshire and at the north end of Main Street, facing the gate of St. Malachy 's Church, there is a statue of the fourth Marquess. The lovely Parish Church of St. Malachy, which was completed in 1772 is a highly interesting Gothic structure which can still boast most of its original furnishings. \n It was built for Wills Hill and is thought to incorporate much of the fabric of its 1662 predecessor. Wills Hill 's aim was to have it made the cathedral of the Protestant diocese of Down. \n The architect 's name is unknown, but Hill himself closely supervised the work. Sir Thomas Drew re-arranged the chancel in 1898 and set the prayer desk and pulpit back against the side walls and aligned the pews (which had been behind the desk and pulpit) along the walls. In the same year, the screens shutting off the baptistry and vestry from the west end of the nave were removed. In 1951 and 1965, the well-known Ulster architect, Denis O'D Hanna, screened off the transept towers and removed the old vestry at the west end of the nave. The new electric lights were designed by Sir. Albert Richardson, P.R.A. Other noteworthy features include the 18th century prayer desk, pulpit and box pews, the east window (to the design of Sir Joshua Reynolds) by Francis Elginton of Birmingham; the north transept memorial to the fifth Marquess of Downshire (1844-74), by Forsythe; William Harty, father of Sir Hamilton Harty, celebrated conductor and composer was organist to the church from 1878 until 1918 and near to the west door is a memorial to Sir Hamilton in the form of a bird bath. There is the State Chair from the Chapel Royal, Dublin Castle; the south transept organ (from Hillsborough Castle) of 1795, by G. P. England and the west gallery organ (1772), by John Snetzler, which was- re-built several times. Near to the Parish Church stands Col. Arthur Hill 's 17th century star-shaped artillery fort. A 1758 Gothic tower house occupies the site of the original gate-tower and a contemporary Strawberry-Hill gazebo crowns the 1758 cart entrance. The lawn gates in front of the tower house are late 18th century, as are the ones at the entrance to Hillsborough Square. \n  The Carriage Restaurant  of Old Coach Road, Hillsborough, certainly has an enviable reputation for catering for functions, large or small.

{"text": "<Irish writing - Churches>\n\n\n<$A>\n CHANGING STATES transformations in modern Irish writing  Robert Welch  \n Routledge \n The most annoying aspect of this book is that it claims to be, or aims to be, something which it is not. To read the blurb one would be led to believe that Prof Welch has constructed a system in which the change from Gaelic to 20th-century, post-industrial culture in Ireland 's literature is examined and the effects of that change shown. Hence, the reader goes through the various chapters with this in mind, only to discover that there is no common thread running through the work. What we have, in fact, is a collection of interesting and enjoyable essays on Welch 's top 11 authors, with introductory chapters and a conclusion tacked on to give the book some sort of  raison d'&/\\etre.  \n This, to say the least, is a frustrating experience. At no time does Welch coherently, sufficiently, or logically develop his belief that the loss of Irish in some way deprives the Irish people of a unique  Weltanschauung.  The Irish language, which appears to be central to his argument, drifts in and out of the collection like a badly-directed actor \u00d0 now you see him, now you don't. His belief that Irish culture is  \"deeply divided\"  because of the loss of the Irish language may or may not be true, but Welch never bothers to explain why he thinks it is. Indeed, one could argue that it is very untrue. \n Contemporary Irish culture is predominately expressed in English and ruled by it. The gap between culture in Irish and culture in English is so great that even the analogy of David and Goliath seems inadequate in describing it. A gaggle of Goliaths versus a one-armed, one-legged, one-eyed David would seem more appropriate. \n The unrelenting attacks upon Irish as the  Zeitgeist  of nationalist Ireland, launched by the many cultural nationalists, have rendered redundant much of Welch 's argument that Irish is  \"a cultural system, full of signs and referents which call up associations and relations that are rooted in the past and are activated by the disposition and evocative power of the words we use\".  These attacks have centred on stressing the everyday commonality of Irish as a language within the Gaeltacht, in an attempt somehow to remove Irish from the 'political arena' and denationalise it. As a result, Irish has been reduced from being a language which 'embodies a national ideal' to being simply a language which 'ought to be protected'. By continually stressing the language 's banality, those who wish to protect it as a cultural artefact run the risk that any romantic notions concerning the language as being the soul of Ireland are blown away. \n Welch argues that  \"The Irish ... committed linguistic suicide.\"  Perhaps. But suicide implies that they thought they were giving up something which was valuable, that there was a  loss  involved. The Irish, being a pragmatic bunch, may not have seen it that way and, if we are perfectly honest, still do not see it that way. Many, I suspect, would identify with O'Connell 's pragmatism: \n  I am sufficiently utilitarian not to regret its gradual abandonment ... Therefore, although the Irish language is connected with many recollections that twine around the hearts of Irishmen, yet the superior utility of the English tongue, as the medium of all modern communications, is so great that I can witness without a sigh the gradual disue of Irish.  \n Recent opinion polls would indicate that the English-speaking Irish may let loose the occasional sigh for the language, but are still very reluctant actually to do anything to ensure its survival. \n The pressure to acquire English, now and in O'Connell 's time, means that communities did not commit suicide so much as make a conscious, if forced, decision to swap one language for another. There is no evidence to suggest that this loss has ever really bothered the Irish people to the extent that those of us who speak the language would like to think. The success of the Gaelic League at the turn of the century in English-speaking areas was not mirrored in Irish-speaking areas, and the lack of a widespread non-state language movement in most Gaeltacht areas would seem to prove further that the language holds little of value for many of its native speakers. \n The difference in outlook in Donegal between Irish-speaking Bunbeg and English-speaking Bundoran is zero. There is no way one could seriously argue that if Irish were to cease being spoken in Bunbeg tomorrow the village would in some way be transformed into a pumpkin. No one would notice. The superstitions, folk-stories and lore of the Gaeltacht died with de Valera 's comely maidens. While Welch argues that the poets Nuala N&/i Dhomhnaill and Michael Hartnett see the loss of Irish as  \"a cataclysmic    blow   to the psyche of the Irish people in that it ripped out and tore asunder all the secret interiors that sponsor the manifold activities that go to make up a culture\"  , it is not true of society in general. \n There is also something very odd in seeing M&/airt&/in O Cadhain and Se&/an O Ri&/aord&/ain bracketed with the likes of W B Yeats, George Moore and James Joyce. They may have lived in the same country but they came from different worlds. O Cadhain was of peasant Connemara stock, a committed republican and supporter of the Irish language. Moore, Joyce and Yeats had absolutely nothing in common with him other than the business of writing. They belonged to an urban, anglicised and anglophile  bourgeoisie  more interested in the pettier points of social status than the day-to-day reality of surviving. \n Their interest in Irish was fleeting \u00d1 if that long. They didn't need the language, they didn't use the language and to imply \u00d1 as Welch does \u00d1 that their work in some way benefited from the tension between two languages and two cultures is wrong. Their work relied upon their imaginative ability in English and their view of literature was moulded by Victorian values. Yeats ' summation of Irish as his national tongue yet English his native tongue neatly encapsulates his attitude to Irish \u00d1 and that of his class. What O Cadhain and his contemporaries wanted from, and demanded of, literature was far removed from what the middle-class and pre-Easter 1916 generation of English literature wanted. \n What Welch does succeed in doing is to muddy the waters every once and a while by dropping the occasional Irish pebble into his English-language pond. Synge knew Irish, Heaney knows Irish and so does Friel. Fair enough; but can they all be tied together by this very thin thread? What Synge wrote about is not what Friel writes about and Heaney 's interest in Irish is peripheral. Would he be any less a poet had he never heard a word of Irish? Do you need Irish to watch one of Synge 's plays or Friel 's, or to read and understand Heaney 's work? \n No. \n\n\n<$B>\n HILLSBOROUGH In the Churches at Christmas \n The four Sundays of Advent are days of preparation for the celebration of Christmas and Christ 's coming into the world. During those days there are many opportunities to reflect on God 's love for the world and on the Light of Christ that still shines in many places of darkness. \n The 1992 Advent Sermon at Hillsborough Parish Church will be delivered by the Bishop of Down and Dromore, the Rt. Rev. Gordon McMullan. The sermon, entitled \"Going with the grain\", will look at the human implications of the free market economy. That will be at 11.00 a.m. on Sunday, 6th December. On the same evening at 7.30 p.m. the village community will come together with children from the primary school for the switching on of the Christmas tree lights in the Church Square. \n During the weeks of Advent a toy collection is made for children in need. New toys are placed in the church windows and then as Christmas comes the Salvation Army distribute them to homes where toys are scarce. \n On the last Sunday night of Advent, the Sunday before Christmas (20th December), the Christmas story is related in words and music and symbol in a Service of Lessons, Carols and Christingles. The service comes to an end as the children carry lighted Christingles out into the darkness of the winter night and so herald the coming of the Light of Christ into the world. Christmas is now very near. \n Christmas Day begins at Hillsborough on the stroke of midnight. Then the bells ring out in celebration of the Day that Christ was born. Worship continues that day with services at 8.30 a.m., 11.00 a.m. and 12 noon. \n My message to people this year is in this Advent Prayer: \n  Grant, o God, as we rejoice in the hope of the coming of our Saviour Jesus Christ so we may prepare the way for His Coming again by the joyful service and the faithful witness of our daily lives, and May the God of hope fill you with all Joy and Peace as you trust in Him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. Amen.  \n PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH \n Christmas - the season of celebration and thanksgiving, when we remember the birth of Jesus! It is a wonderful time, for the church and the community, but there is always the danger that we allow the traditional festivities to blind us to the awful surroundings that were that stable in Bethlehem and the dreadful plight of millions who are starving in our world today. Even in the midst of the present recession, the church needs to confront people with the human tendency towards greed an its striking contrast to God 's pattern of giving. \n The Congregation of Hillsborough Presbyterian Church will once again this year be taking a special offering for World Development throughout the Christmas period. In recent years over <*> pound sign </*> 2000 has been raised annually and we hope to exceed that in 1992. But we hope to do much more. the months leading up to Christmas we have been reflecting on some of the barriers that exist in today 's world and how they can be crossed \"in Christ\". Our prayer is that in our own lives, in the life of our community and world, the message of the Angels will become a reality this Christmas:  \"Glory to God in the Highest and on earth Peace, Goodwill towards men.\"  \n The Christmas activities and services in the congregation are as follows:  Saturday, 5th December - Senior Citizens Party. \n Saturday, 12th December \u00d0 Sunday School Parties. \n Sunday, 20th December \u00d0 Family Services at 10 a.m. and 11.30 a.m. with music from the Junior Choir Festival of Lessons and Carols by Candlelight at 7 p.m. by the Senior Choir. This Service will be followed by a supper served by the Young Women of the Congregation. \n Thursday, 24th December - Christmas Day Family Service at 10.30 a.m. \n ELIM PENTECOSTAL CHURCH \n a few minutes from the village of Hillsborough on the Moira Road is the Elim Pentecostal Church. \n Often referred to as the Church with a difference because of its lively praise and worship and belief that the church which is Christ 's body, should care for the community spirit, soul and body. In doing so we hope to reflect God 's love and His comprehensive, caring nature. \n The spiritual needs of members are met in regular Sunday and mid-week services. Activities arranged to cater for other needs include Youth Together (Sunday School), Youth Ministries, Boys Brigade, Girls Brigade, Teens Youth Club, Nursery School/Playgroup, Mums and Toddlers and a Coffee shop. \n The elderly have not been forgotten with visits in their homes from our team of Home Visitors, a weekly craft class and monthly Luncheon Club. Adjacent to the church complex is one of our Elim Nursing Homes \"Lisadian House\" which provides an efficient, non-acute care unit for 29 frail and elderly residents in single bedrooms. \n Our aim is to demonstrate the love of Christ in every way possible to the local community in which we work and worship.

About half a mile to the south-east, sheltered by low hills and trees, is Loch Bricleann or Bricriu 's Lake, which gives the village its name. The setting takes us back almost two thousand years to one of the most famous stories in the Ulster cycle. It concerns Bricriu, a wealthy and malicious chieftain who decided to give a feast and for that purpose built a house big enough to accommodate the Ulster heroes and their wives. It was truly magnificent, a branch-red d&/un, with nine rooms overlaid with gold, modelled on the palace at Eamhan Mhaca. The feast was equally sumptuous, consisting of beef broth, roast boar, salmon, honey cakes and many other dishes; to drink the guests had the finest of ale, the choicest of mead and the rarest of wines. Bricriu promised the  \"hero 's portion\"  to the Red Branch knight who would prove himself the bravest of the company, a challenge which naturally led first to bitter arguments and then to bitter blows. Their host had planned for this. Not for nothing was he named Bricriu Poison-Tongue. \n In another story,  The Wooing of &/Et&/ain,  which was written down at Clonmacnoise around the year 1000, from oral sources, we read how the High King Eochaidh made a great feast at Tara at which mead, fine wines and barrels of ale were served. These two early tales are interesting because they tell us of the kind of food and drink served at princely banquets. Today royal Tara stands no more. All that remains of what was once the noblest residence in Ireland is a windswept hill, where archaeologists trace the outlines of the palace, and folk tales keep alive the memory of the mead banqueting-hall, where according to legend the heroes quaffed their favourite brew. \n Mead was long a favourite drink, said to be both potent and delicious. It was made from honey, clear sparkling water and aromatic plants. Bragget, made by fermenting ale and honey together, was also much enjoyed for it is frequently mentioned in medieval records. Bees were kept in very great numbers, and to have a surplus of honey for mead-making was highly desirable; districts that produced mead in quantity were lauded by the poets. St Brigid, that redoubtable woman who knew how to influence prelates and princes, is said to have given the King of Leinster a cup of mead to drink when he came to visit her convent. It was of unsurpassing quality and no doubt very potent to boot. Probably as a result of her hospitality she was given a tract of land or some gift she needed for her work amongst the sick and needy. She was noted for the excellence of her kitchen, and had the reputation of brewing the best ale in Ireland. But she was not the only one of the early saints who kept a good cask or two. St Patrick had his favourite brewer who travelled Ireland with him on his missionary work. \n Anyone who wished to do so was free to brew his own ale, but the Brehon laws laid down regulations for the sale of ale and for the proper running of ale-houses. Early monastic settlements were sizeable, including, as they did, not only the refectory, kitchens and dormitories for the monks but workshops, bakeries, and accommodation to house lay workers and their families, visiting penitents, students, and indeed anyone who might seek shelter. Regulations which governed everything from the hour of rising of the community to the hour when the weary monk might retire to his cell gave it as a rule of thumb that on days of high feasting laymen and clerics should get equal quantities of food, but that the tonsured monk should get only half as much ale to drink as his brother in the laity. \n Much of the early ale was made from malted grain - oats, wheat or barley - together with spring water and honey. Before the introduction of hops in the 16th century, beer, like ale, made with a simple infusion of fermented malt, might be flavoured with aromatic and astringent plants. Oak bark is said to have been used for this purpose, as well as buck beans found in the neighbourhood of certain raths. It was not until around 1780 that beer began to be produced on a commercial scale by small breweries, made from a mixture of malt, grain, water, sugar, yeast and hops. In earlier times the words  ale  and  beer  were often synonymous. The Irish also drank a cider called  nenadmin  made from whortleberries or blackberries. \n Perhaps the drink best remembered in folklore is the famous heather ale, a legacy of the years when the long-prowed Viking ships raided Irish waters, and a simple monk whose name we shall never know wrote on the margin of the manuscript he was illustrating one stormy winter night:\n  Fierce and wile is the wind tonight; It turns the tresses of the sea to white; On such a night as this I take my ease; Fierce Northmen only course the quiet seas.  \n The story goes that the Vikings or Danes, as they are traditionally known, were superb brewers of beer, but their heather ale was unsurpassed; the recipe, a carefully guarded secret, was handed down from father to son. After the Battle of Clontarf in 1014, when the power of the Danes in Ireland was finally broken and the foreigners driven into the sea, only one family escaped. They were taken captive by an Irish chieftain near the Cliffs of Moher in Co Clare and were offered their lives in exchange for the secret of the brew.  \"I would be ashamed to tell you before my son,\"  the fierce old Dane said, and watched unmoved as the young man was put to the sword. He then led his captor to the edge of the cliff and whispered long and earnestly in the other 's ear. \n  \"And is that all there is to it? The special herbs and the manner of brewing?\"  The chieftain hugged the old man in delight.  \"You have bought your life; you are free to go.\"  \n But at this the Dane tightened his grip.  \"Had my son lived he might have bartered the secret for his life, but now you and I alone know how the heather ale is made and we shall take that knowledge with us to our doom.\"  And with those words the Dane jumped over the cliff, taking the Irish chieftain with him to a watery grave far below. And so was lost for ever the secret of the heather ale. \n We may safely assume that by the 12th century there were many places in Ireland which enjoyed the reputation of making excellent ales and many a man who had a good palate for a fine wine. Even in early times there was considerable trade with the Continent. Furs and hides were exported to Gaul, and back came cargoes of wine, so that amongst wealthy merchants and princelings it was a well-known drink. \n One of the most enigmatic anecdotes of the year AD 535 tells of dark passions and a woman betrayed. It appears that the palace of Cletty was set on fire by a certain beautiful lady, who had been scorned by the king, while the members of the court were at table.  \"To escape the flames,\"  the record says,  \"the king plunged into a vat of wine but was drowned.\"  And so the lady was avenged; but there the record ends, and we hall never know the    full   story. Was there a still more beautiful rival for the king 's heart involved, or a jealous wife waiting in the wings, or even a distracted husband who had refused to play cuckold any longer and was bent on revenge? What subsequently happened the dark lady? Did she enter a nunnery? Placate her husband as so many women before and since have done? Did she lie awake at night weeping over her dead love or did she put the past behind her? One thing is certain, human nature never changes, and crimes of passion happen in every stratum of society and in every age.\n Giraldue Cambrensis, or Gerald the Welshman, who visited Ireland in the 12th century and who wrote what is probably the first travel book about the island, commented on the abundance of wine imported into the country from Poitou, France. A story is told of how in the 13th century a Munster chieftain, one Amhlaoibh &/O hEidirsceoil was given his nickname. One day, as a young boy, he was down at the harbour, watching the ships and dreaming of far distant lands as young boys do, when he was abducted by a rival chieftain and handed over to the crew of a wine ship from Gascony as a pledge of payment for a cargo. He was taken to France and put to work in the vineyards, thereby giving credence to the old belief that fruit grew without blemish if the vines were tended by those of noble blood. Later the youth was brought back to Ireland and ever afterwards bore the nickname  \"the Gascon.\"  \n Wine and ale flowed freely at great feasts given by princes and chieftains. A scribe named Muirch&/u writing in the 7th century describes how St Patrick came to the palace of King Laoghaire at Tara on Easter Sunday in the year of Our Lord 433. There he found kings, princes and druids feasting and drinking wine. From what we know of Patrick, he probably joined the company in the spirit of good will, before setting about converting the pagans. This custom seems not to have changed down the years. A 13th-century poem speaks of the bard going from  \"one feast of purple wine to another.\"  \n However, not all drink consumed was come by honestly. Not infrequently the Irish levied \"blacks rents\" on the Pale of Dublin and surrounding districts. In 1444 Eoghan O'Neill, Lord of Tyrone, plundered the town of Dundalk, and demanded sixty marks and two tons of wine in return for not destroying the town by fire - a demand that was quickly met by the frightened townsfolk.\n By the 16th century cheap, low-quality wine had become more readily available, especially around coastal waters where Spanish and English merchant seamen traded wine, beer and bales of silk for hides, fish, salt and meat. Sometimes it was a case, not of honest trading but of treacherous intents. We read of English merchant ships arriving in ports with cargoes of fine wines and encouraging Irish chieftains to imbibe, not wisely but too well, while their followers, left leaderless were rounded by the enemy army - much the same technique as was employed by Elizabeth 's minions when the captain of the decoy ship at Lough Swilly invited the young Aodh Ruadh &/O D&/onaill aboard at Christmas 1587, made him drunk on wine and took him in chains to Dublin Castle. \n Fynes Moryson, that inveterate traveller and historian who came to Ireland as Lord Mountjoy 's secretary in 1600 and remained with Mountjoy all through the long and bitter campaign which ended with the defeat of the great Hugh O'Neill, kept a record of his time here, entitled  The Commonwealth of Ireland . He wrote that when the common Irish have money to spend they like to imbibe freely:\n  Whenever they come to a market town to sell a cow or a horse they never return home until they have drunk the price in Spanish wine, which they call the \"King of Spain 's daughter.\"  \n A brisk trade in smuggling wine and fine brandy along the western seaboard and around the coast of Kerry Island lasted until well into the 19th century. After the defeat of Patrick Sarsfield and the signing of the Treaty of Limerick in 1691, a treaty which was broken ere the ink was dry, many of the old Irish aristocracy with their retainers fled the country for ever. Following them went the soldiers who had fought with Sarsfield, each man with a price on his head. The ships that took the Wild Geese as the members of the Irish Brigade came to be known on the battlefields of Europe, often engaged in a two-way smuggling exercise, running in wine and spiriting out wanted men. \n It is no exaggeration to say that since the late Middle Ages when the art of distilling became known in these parts, Irish whiskey has always been rated the best there is. Time and again writers and travellers to our shores have commented on the excellence of our  aqua vitae,  or to give it the old Irish title,  uisce beatha, </italic> meaning \"water of life\", which was indeed how many people regarded it. \n In folk tales a popular motif is where the hero is put under  geasa  or bonds to undertake a journey to the Well and the World 's End, or some other such mythical place, in search of the water of life. His journey is fraught with dangers, he performs incredible feats of valour, is often helped by fabulous animals or magical old men or women and finally succeeds in his quest and is rewarded with the hand of a princess in marriage. In all such tales we are told that the \"water of life\" cures all ills, but more than that, it restores youth, vigour and beauty to the old, the decrepit and the ugly. \n It is perhaps no surprise to learn that our early whiskey was indeed used to cure illness and to invigorate the weak and low-spirited. It is not known for certain when the first Irish whiskey was distilled, but we do know that from the 15th century onwards it supplemented wine and beer.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "46db3f65-c06e-4015-a3b3-f591d96ec83c", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.608434+00:00"}
{"text": "<Music - Restaurant>\n\n\n<$A>\n There 's no sign of our Daniel O'Donnell in Nashville, the country music capital of the world, writes  Harry Ferguson \n Kitsch and country  \n A COUPLE of days into my trip to Nashville I began to feel uncomfortable. The more I got the feel for the place and came to understand that there are only three important things to Nashville as a location - country music, country music, and country music - the more I was beset with a sense of existential angst; that something was missing. It was Daniel O'Donnell. More to the point, it was the  absence  of Daniel that shocked. Not a sign of him anywhere in the Country capital of the world. Some four years after the music business re-classified his records as not country, here I was having to confront headon my denial of the tragedy of what they did to Daniel. \n While the Country Music Hall of Fame minus Daniel seems a contradiction in terms, it is superb; a real treasure. As well as featuring today 's stars - Garth Brooks and co - it is a veritable journey into the stars of one 's childhood, with original outfits, cowboy boots, instruments, original records and other trinkets that were adorned by the likes of Roy Rogers, Johnny Cash, Jim Reeves, Dolly Parton, Emmylou Harris. There 's even Elvis Presley 's very own 'Solid Gold' 1960 Cadillac which was his favourite. \n The symbiotic relationship between Nashville and country music all began when the Grand Ole Opry Theatre opened in the 1920s and established itself as the country venue. While the original theatre is still there in Downtown Nashville and worth a visit, today 's Opry has been relocated to a site some 20 miles outside of the City which is disappointingly hard to reach without a car. \n There were other compensations for Daniel 's absence. Like meeting Willis Gupton, who informed me that when he was four years old his  \"daddy, who was a bluegrass picker,\"  gave him his first guitar. Willis 's promotional literature refers to his  \"no nonsense approach [as] refreshing, exciting, and a rare breed especially in today 's spit and polish, New York/LA style of country music that has invaded Nashville. You can't help but love this guy 's honesty, and sense of good ol' fashioned country humour ... Get off that couch and give Willis Gupton a spin! He 'll do more for ya than 14 cups of strong black coffee.\"  Howl me back!! \n  \"Invade Nashville\"  - now why didn't Daniel think of  that?  Willis gave me a promo' copy of his debut single, 'Bringing Home The Bacon', and - in that typically pathetic post-colonial low self-esteem Oirish way of not being able to take something for nothing - I assured him that there could well be a spot waiting for him on  Kenny Live.  God knows it feels like just about everyone else from Nashville has been on it. \n The naked ambition of the endless stream of wannabees is just one of the eerie pleasures of Nashville. Even the buskers have cut CDs. I bought one for <*> dollar sign </*> 10 off a guy called Jeff Paz who was singing his heart out on the street accompanied by a very sophisticated canned soundtrack. He autographed it for me with such sincerity and earnestness that the likes of Willis and Jeff make Daniel seem  mean.  \n Garth Brooks is the superstar ideal they 're all dreaming of. When you visit the \"Garth Store\" in Downtown Nashville, you can see why. This guy is even richer than Daniel O'Donnell, and possibly even nicer. If you don't believe me, Pat Kenny seems to think so, and he 's met them both. So there. \n America never fails to fascinate, and so a visit to Nashville enables one to absorb the general horrors and delights of this extraordinary country. The obsession with food - it 's everywhere. The wonderful customer service. While the deference can irk - \"Sir\" - the guy who served me in Nashville 's brilliant Hard Rock Cafe was just magic in terms of the routine care and attention he lavished on me. \n And who cares anymore if they don't  really  give a damn whether or not you  \"have a nice day!\"  I 'd prefer it anyday to the feeling of being ignored and a nuisance that can be served up in some Irish businesses. Then there 's the television - travel always gives a new perspective on our own national passions - and if Diarmuid Doyle thinks RTE is bad, jaysus he should sit through a few days of trash they call American TV. If they 'd only make those confessional talk-shows  <&Irish> as Gaeilge! </&Irish>  Or perhaps not. \n Yet, on its own terms, Nashville has to go down as one of the USA 's most superficially boring cities. Not only does it lack the in-your-face dynamism and culture of a New York or a San Francisco, it looks for the most part like a dump. Give it half a chance though and - not unlike Daniel himself - it grows on you. The cowboy boot and hat shops are a delight - boots of all shapes and sizes and Stetsons as far as the eye can see. You can even buy a pair of cowboy golf boots - studs and all! \n Nashville is the nerve centre of the religious publishing industry of the States. The gigantic shops make our own Veritas look, well, small. In the Baptist shop, for instance, you can buy books on every aspect of the human condition - with the exception of homosexuality, of course (see elsewhere under sexual perversions and the devil). \n My own favourite was the section on masculinity and the family which included titles such as  Boys: Shaping Ordinary Boys into Extraordinary Men  by William Beausay II (what I want to know is just how did Mr and Mrs O'Donnell get a hold of that book in Donegal and so long ago?),  Boys to Men: How Fathers Can Help Build Character in Their Sons,  by Steve Lee, Ed D and Chap Clark. The authors of these books, and others in the 'Men of Integrity' series, are pictured on the dust-jackets complete with their much heralded Ed D 's and looking even cleaner than Daniel - which is hard to believe I know, but understandable I suppose given the number of times they 've been baptised. \n The religious revival in the States is quite something. There are over 80 Baptist Churches within that single denomination alone in the greater Nashville area (the State of Tennessee has literally hundreds). Just one of these churches holds 4,000 and has a congregation of 6,000. They have two services on a Sunday, some 20 pastors, and a nightmare organising the car-parking. \n Nashville, I learned, is the kitsch capital of the States - Junk City USA.    The   knickknack and memorabilia shops are just packed full of the most naff range of merchandise imaginable; enough to make my Daniel O'Donnell mugs and calendar seem sophisticated, part of high culture. Inevitably perhaps, as nostalgia isn't what it used to be, Elvis memorabilia looms large - even if he is a Memphis boy. \n A very well organised tour of the Music City neighbourhood, where all the big stars have their agents, record companies their administrative headquarters and the big recording deals are struck etc, culminates in a visit to RCA 's Studio B. The highlight was a guide who clearly loves The King, identifying with such relish the very spot where Elvis stood to record some of his great albums. \n Ultimately, Music City USA really comes into its own after dark. The competitive environment of the music business is such that the standard of fun-of-the-mill acts in bars and clubs is extraordinarily high and fabulous value as most have no cover-charge. \n A visit to the Wild Horse Saloon for the Line-Dancing is a must. These cowgirls and boys (real men  do  line-dance, it seems) sure know how to move in majestic ways. They 'll even let you join in, although beware as those involved in the sessions for so-called beginners seemed frighteningly co-ordinated and twinkly-toed to this wrong-footed eejit. Hardly surprising, perhaps, as I never could quite master jiving. \n And speaking of jiving, Daniel, you 're as well out of it ... But watch out for yer man Willis Gupton, \"invading Ireland\" and creeping up your inside. \n\n\n<$B>\n The Roundwood Inn is the perfect place to whet a healthy appetite honed in the fresh mountainous air of Wicklow, writes  Tom Doorley \n Pub grub to rival haute cuisine  \n The Roundwood Inn may not be the highest pub in Ireland but it 's not far off it. However, it is unique in another way. I can think of no other pub that has such a splendid restaurant attached and there are very few indeed that can rival Jurgen Schwalm 's superb and inexpensive bar food. \n This is the place to aim for after a trek in the mountains because it deals with healthy appetites honed in the fresh air of Wicklow. The food is unpretentious, scrupulously fresh, sensitively prepared and served in generous portions. \n You can enjoy an aperitif in the bar which is wonderfully un-twee, a real hostelry with lots of bronzed mountainy men getting themselves outside creamy-headed pints of Guinness. Then head in to the restaurant. \n We arrived on a quiet Thursday evening with a gale blowing outside and the kind of rain that soaks you to the skin in seconds making the billage of Roundwood look like an oasis in a wintry desert. \n I had snails, French ones, not the rather rubbery Irish version, served out of the shell (thank heaven), swimming in bubbling, pungent garlic butter and topped with breadcrumbs and finely chopped parsley. \n Snails to me don't taste of very much but they are a wonderful way of eating garlic butter. These snails were very good indeed, tender and juicy. \n My companion 's scallops, were plump almost to the point of obesity, and intense with flavour, just flashed in the pan for a few seconds with some garlic butter. In all its simplicity this dish showed how first class raw materials and a deft hand in the kitchen leave haute cuisine in the shade. We mopped up the buttery juices with chunky, dark brown bread. \n My brick-shaped sirloin steak was perfection in all its juicy, pink tenderness and the accompanying peppercorn sauce, while not the best I 've had, was satisfactory all the same. The companion's version - mountains of the stuff - was pleasantly pink in the middle after gentle grilling, moist and surprisingly tender. It came with a dense, dark, wild mushroom sauce which hit the spot. \n Our ratatouille, a rather grey, mushy affair, was the only low point. Boiled new spuds of impressive size (not the fashionable little marbles) were put to good effect in mopping up the sauces and braised lengths of celery were assertively flavourful and not even remotely overdone. \n A blueberry pancake was unctuous yet acidic enough not to be cloying and my apple and almond pancake was a triumph. It was served flat and it seemed that almond and apple slices were added at the point where the batter began to set, then sugared and put under a very hot grill to caramelise the lot. It was superb and very, very filling. Commercial vanilla ice cream acted as a cooling lubricant. \n We hugely enjoyed a bottle of dry Baden white wine from Germany, Martin Schongauer Grauer Burgunder Trocken, actually a Pinot Gris, vinified bone dry and weighing in at 11.5 <*> per cent </*> ( <*> pound sign </*> 16.95). It was excellent and is imported directly by Jurgen Schwalm himself. \n As the rain beat against the windows in horizontal sheets we fortified ourselves against the long journey home with Redbreast, the only pure pot still Irish whiskey on the market, immaculately smooth and civilised and infinitely superior to your average trendy malt Scotch. Expresso was temporarily not available but Jurgen brewed up some extra strong coffee in a plunger pot. With a brace of Ballygowans the bill came to <*> pound sign </*> 77.00 \n The Roundwood Inn, Roundwood, Co. Wicklow.

{"text": "<Irish observatories>\n\n\n<$A>\n 4 Reconstruction After World War II, 1947-1974 \n The task of writing the full story of Irish astronomy from the early 1940's, when Eric Lindsay at Armagh first seriously tackled the possibility of a joint approach with a re-founded Dunsink, up to Lindsay 's death in 1974, has not yet been comprehensively faced. In conjunction with Hermann Bruck and Susan McKenna-Lawlor, I produced personal accounts in my own history of Dunsink (Wayman, pp. 206-258), but Bennett specifically omitted, in his bicentennial history of Armagh, the details of the Boyden Observatory collaboration after 1954. On this occasion, I cannot do the subject justice, but it is of great interest and must be included to the extent of the time available to me. \n Eric Lindsay, coming to Armagh in 1938, indeed coming back to Armagh, his native county, knew that major alterations had to be made if the observatory were to survive. He had spent some years at Harvard Observatory and had been entrusted for two years with the post of Assistant Director of Boyden Observatory in the Orange Free State in South Africa. The advent of the Second World War notwithstanding, he took the strengthening of Irish participation in practical observing programmes at Boyden as one of his major interests for the remainder of his life, that is over thirty years. \n Lindsay saw that Eamon de Valera, then Taoiseach in the Dublin government, was keenly interested in including Dunsink Observatory in his new Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies; indeed, de Valera had admired Sir Edmund Whittaker during the years 1906 to 1912 when he, de Valera, had been a mathematics lecturer in the Carysfort Teachers Training College. He had taken as one of his aims for the Institute the perpetuation in conscious memory of, and if possible the future emulation of, Sir William Rowan Hamilton as an Irish mathematician. The observatory at that time was rented to two tenants, the main building to Dr Oliver Chance, a prominent member of the medical profession, and Dunsink House to Rev. R. M. Gwynn, a Fellow of Trinity College, and was quite out of use as an observatory, although mail continued to come from all over the world, and some semblance of dealing with it was maintained by F. J. O'Connor, a Trinity lecturer in astronomy for the general degree, who had assisted at Dunsink since he was 16 years old. \n On 11th November 1942, Lindsay wrote (Wayman, p.331) to Eamon de Valera with the specific suggestion that Armagh and Dunsink could be joined in a venture to support astronomical work at Boyden Observatory, regarded as the Southern observing station of Harvard College Observatory, which was formerly in Peru, but moved to South Africa in 1927. The particular intention was to obtain photographic material that could be brought back to Ireland for measurement and analysis. This had always been the modus operandi for those at Harvard interested in southern hemisphere material, especially Professor A. H. Shapley and the Gaposchkins. Using material from Peru, the Henry Draper Catalogue had included the southern hemisphere, and from plates of the Magellanic Clouds Henrietta Leavitt had, in 1912, discovered the period-luminosity relation of cepheid variable stars (Leavitt, 1912). \n Lindsay suggested as early as 1942 the construction of a modern telescope which could be jointly owned by Armagh, Dunsink, and Harvard and it soon became clear that the Schmidt principle should be the basis of such a photographic telescope. James Baker of Harvard at that very time was examining the possibility of the so-called Schmidt-Cassegrain optical systems for large astronomical cameras. By the combination of two mirrors of similar curvature, a concave primary and a concave secondary, Baker showed that the advantages that could be obtained over the single-mirror Schmidt system were flatness and accessibility of the field and shorter tube-length in comparison with focal length. \n Eamon de Valera, in due course, incorporated Lindsay 's suggestions in his provisions for that part of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies that became the School of Cosmic Physics, with three Senior Professors in the general areas of astronomy, cosmic ray studies, and geophysics including meteorology. The necessary Establishment Order founding the School went through Dail Eireann in March 1947, not without birth-pains (Wayman, p.334). Due to the importance of Shannon as a transatlantic air terminal, emphasis was put on the science of meteorology as being necessary for Ireland. In the event, meteorological science has not been followed in the School in any academic sense; the emphasis of the Section, very successfully, has been on geophysical work. \n Hermann Bruck, chosen by de Valera as the first director of the newly-organised Dunsink, while perfectly happy to be part of the 7-year old Institute, did not at first approve of Dunsink being part of the School of Cosmic Physics (Wayman, p.215). Consequently, his appointment was delayed until October 1947. Meanwhile, in April, the agreement with Harvard concerning the construction of the 'Armagh-Dunsink-Harvard' telescope by Perkin-Elmer Company of Boston was signed. Bruck, of course, had many matters on his hands, not least, from 1952, when the telescope was nearing completion, a commitment to host the International Astronomical Union General Assembly in Dublin in September 1955. \n Eric Lindsay was very keen on the implementation of the ADH for a number of projects, including valuable catalogues of red0emission objects in the Magellanic Clouds (E. M. Lindsay, 1956, 1961). \n The fact that a formal agreement had been established between the Northern Ireland Government and the Dublin Government was a unique achievement. Lindsay emphasised strongly the need to pursue cross-border common aims, and he tended to shrink somewhat from U.K. proposals for new astronomical facilities to be operated by several bodies jointly. He was not thoroughly immersed in the technicalities of the ADH instrument and, in discussing operational problems with me many years later, he expressed himself quite surprised that a telescope conceived in the then-modern style should produce intractable mechanical and optical problems. Those who have followed telescope construction since then, up to and including the Hubble Space Telescope, are unlikely to be so surprised. Funds were quite restricted, of course, even though the project had the full support of Harlow Shapley, Harvard 's director. It did not seem possible to obtain a permanent successor to J.S. Paraskevopoulos as director of Boyden; a succession of short-term temporary directors were appointed, so that there was no one person with an unremitting aim of commissioning the ADH, and indeed 'Paras' himself was said to have thought the former Bruce telescope mounting was overloaded by adapting it to the ADH. Technical details tended to be dealt with by the admirable Ernest Burton, long-serving mechanic and general factotum at Boyden, who grew up under the aegis of Paraskevopoulos in the early 1930's. \n Erected on its barely adequate mounting, the ADH telescope produced magnificent photographs of the dense southern hemisphere Milky Way and Magellanic Cloud regions. The mounting was of 1933 design (by Fecker) and had a simple Gerrish pendulum-controlled d.c. motor drive of that era. The telescope needed careful coaxing if it were to give its best results and among the Armagh staff now is John butler who, as a research scholar at Dunsink in the period from 1965 to 1969 became one of the few who mastered its operation. David Andrews, too, staff member at Armagh since 1963, as resident Acting Director at Boyden for the period 1965-1966, had mastered the ADH and he produced, among other good data, material for his first Armagh Atlas of the Orion Region (Andrews, 1974) which was followed by a much more comprehensive second Atlas (Andrews, 1981) produced with the use of the UK Schmidt at Siding Spring and the automatic RGO 'Galaxy' machine. During his period at Dunsink Hermann Bruck had tackled many things and at least two of his assistants, Hugh Butler, followed by Michael J. Smyth, used plate material from the ADH telescope. Michael Smyth reduced cluster magnitude-colour diagrams and incorporates some ADH plates in his Edinburgh University teaching material to this day. Another important facility of the ADH telescope that was implemented from 1955 onwards was the provision of a large objective prism, enabling the star images to be recorded as tightly-packed spectra of dispersion around 250 A/mm at H-gamma. This was one of the largest prisms ever made, but, as with other features of the Boyden equipment there were problems. The telescope could not be accurately guided when the prism was on, and it was strongly suspected that the tube was overloaded by the weight of the prism and the added counterweights, although this was never fully demonstrated. \n Mervyn Ellison, son of Rev. William Ellison (Armagh director 1918-1936), was director at Dunsink from 1958 up to his relatively early death in 1963 and was my immediate predecessor. He had hardly turned his attention at all to the question of the ADH and Boyden, although both Michael Smyth and he had attended some meetings of the newly formed Boyden Council. Since I had had experience at Pretoria and Cape Town from 1957 to 1960, I adopted the policy that Boyden facilities, both at the ADH and the 60-inch reflector, ought to be utilised as much as possible from both Armagh and Dunsink. With the help of John Butler, Brendan Byrne, Brendan Jordan and others at Dunsink, and with co-operation from Eric Lindsay and David Andrews at Armagh, a certain amount was achieved during the period 1965-1972. A large body of data on faint cepheid variable stars in the Magellanic Clouds was obtained by John Butler, who successfully calibrated the plates using the 60-inch reflector, and many new light curves were published (Butler, 1976, 1978; Wayman et al., 1984). This material led, too, to a useful discussion of rate of change period of variable stars in both Magellanic Clouds, a unique body of data (Deasy and Wayman, 1986). \n However, support from Harvard disappeared during the period of increasing opposition to the overtly pro-apartheid regime that set in in South Africa from the time of the establishment of the Republic there in 1960. Harvard was replaced by the Boyden Council by the Smithsonian Institution. Donald H. Menzel, as an Emeritus Professor, and a very eminent senior astronomer, represented the Institution on the Council on behalf of Fred Whipple. The incorporation of the University of the Orange Free State at Bloemfontein, as the local university, into the Boyden Council in 1966 and the installation of Alan Jarrett, formerly at Queen 's University, Belfast, as director in 1968, was necessary in order to provide greater permanency, stability, and funding, but, in a climate of increasing difficultly in operating in South Africa, really satisfactory progress at Boyden became impossible. After Eric Lindsay 's sudden death in 1974, the Smithsonian withdrew completely and the informal Boyden Council was dissolved. The optical parts of the ADH telescope are in storage at Dunsink. In 1977 Mart de Groot and I made strong efforts to have them adopted in a possible new telescope at the San Pedro Martyr observatory site of the National University of Mexico near Tijuana, Baja California, but it was found not to be a viable project; the cost of incorporating them would be greater than the cost of purchasing a complete conventional telescope of more effective design off-the-shelf. \n With the advent of SERC facilities in Australia, La Palma and Hawii, and with the possibility of incorporating the Republic of Ireland in the Spanish Institute of Astrophysics of the Canaries in 1979, a whole series of other doors have opened. There have been some joint technical projects in recent years; Mart de Groot continues to give good advice at the Governing Board of the School of Cosmic Physics, as did Eric Lindsay before him, and he also serves on that Board 's Advisory Committee for La Palma and the HST. At present he is Chairman of the Royal Irish Academy National Committee for Astronomy that as an Academy committee takes the whole of Ireland as its domain; I continue to serve on the Board of Management at Armagh Observatory and Planetarium, as well as (since 1965) on the Board of Governors and Guardians of Armagh Observatory, and I am very proud of being able to do so.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "aec66292-620e-4844-a7de-96b07859796f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.610729+00:00"}
{"text": "<O'Leary case>\n\n\n<$A>\n  Legal pogrom  \n Catholics were in a novel position from late 1766. The attempted legal pogrom in Munster (on the pretext of suppressing Whiteboy activity) which had taken the life of Father Nicholas Sheehy and three minor gentlemen in 1766, was halted within the year. The collapse of the case against forty other propertied Catholics, largely through Edmund Burke 's masterful organisation of the defence team and background lobbying, may have led some like O'Leary to challenge the local establishment recklessly. It was probably fear in the wake of the traumatic year 1766 that accounted for the opposition of the Derrynane O'Connell family to the 1767 marriage of a daughter, Eibhl&/in Dubh N&/i; Chonaill, to O'Leary, an assertive young army officer just returned from overseas. It is reflected too in the Baldwin-O'Leary tension that briefly surfaces in the poem: James Baldwin, who had married a sister of Eibhl&/in Dubh, may have shared the misgivings of other Baldwins who aligned themselves against O'Leary in 1771. \n O'Leary 's return in 1767 occurred at that decisive moment when old fears from the past and a new sense that Catholics could successfully be assertive were simultaneously in the air. Just as the Sheehy episode in 1766 marked the termination of an era of political persecution in Tipperary and north Cork, so too can the O'Leary episode in 1773 be regarded as a d&/enouement to tensions in west Cork. The reluctance to proceed against O'Leary at the assizes after the fairly routine step of lodging bills of indictment with the grand jury in August 1771 shows how times had changed: within a major county, the anti-Catholic faction was hesitant and could no longer count on general backing. A bill of indictment required the oaths of at least twelve grand jurors, but became effective only if a majority of jurors in full session returned it as a 'true bill'. In some respects the two periods mark the point at which more virulent forms of local anti-Catholicism became a discredited political commodity. \n  O'Leary 's horse demanded for <*> pound sign </*> 5  \n Despite suggestions of rivalry in love or in horse racing, the background to the O'Leary story was entirely political. The Muskerry Constitutional Society was founded in July 1771 and sought  'complaints which any injured poor persons of the barony of Muskerry may present to them'  in an    advertisement   in the  Cork Evening Post  on 18 July. After its next meeting on 7 August, it again sought 'communications' from the public in the  Cork Evening Post  of 19 August. The same issue contained a reply from O'Leary which stated that he had been charged  'with different crimes by different persons',  and declared his readiness to stand trial on them. Therefore, by August, the Society were seeking specific evidence against O'Leary (though they may not necessarily have had him directly in mind in early July) in order to substantiate the charges in bills they were preparing. Significantly, the dispute with the magistrate Abraham Morris occurred on 13 July, according to a later Morris statement of 7 October, which again appeared in the  Cork Evening Post.  Thus the founding of the Society with the politically resonant term 'Constitutional' in its name and the O'Leary intervention with Morris occurred in the month preceding the assizes. According to O'Leary 's later declaration, he had gone  'to apply to Mr Morris as magistrate relative to some law proceedings'  on 13 July. O'Leary probably had then made himself obnoxious by his interest in some cases pending at the assizes in a county already notorious for its magistrates ' readiness to keep the penal laws alive. Morris, provoked by O'Leary 's assertiveness and intending to put him in his place, demanded his horse in exchange for <*> pound sign </*> 5. Significantly, O'Leary 's brashness seems to be hinted at in the reaction two years later on receipt of news of his death by Daniel O'Connell, uncle to Eibhl&/in Dubh, grand uncle of the Liberator and an officer in French service. He had met O'Leary in Ireland before his death, and recalled that  'the short acquaintance I had with him gave me a more favourable opinion than I had at first conceived of him'.  \n  Seizure of a gun  \n O'Leary 's alleged seizure of a gun from Morris was one of the charges against him in 1771. Morris, a near-neighbour of O'Leary 's in the vicinity of Macroom, was a supporter of the political interest headed by the Earl of Shannon, County Cork 's premier grandee, which had driven the anti-Catholic campaign both locally in the 1760s and in the 1762 and 1764 sessions in parliament. Morris was not high sheriff in any year in the early 1770s, contrary to what is said in modern accounts. However, he had been high sheriff in 1760, and his nephew was to be high sheriff in 1782 and Shannonite MP in the 1790s. \n Morris 's and O'Leary 's statements and counter statements feature the question of a gun. According to O'Leary, Morris and a servant pursued him bearing firearms; the servant discharged a gun which O'Leary then seized and surrendered to another magistrate. According to Morris, O'Leary seized the gun, and made off with it. The import of this was grave. O'Leary had violated the penal laws by even holding a gun; more seriously he had allegedly acquired it by force in the presence of Morris, a magistrate. Morris 's offer of a reward for the apprehension of O'Leary on 7 October 1771 was followed by a reply by O'Leary dated 19 October, both published in the  Cork Evening Post.  \n The events of July and August 1771 were heavily influenced by the knowledge that the summer assizes were due to begin on 23 August. The Muskerry Constitutional Society 's declaration of 15 August 1771 was signed among others by five clergymen, three Townsends (two of them clergymen), and Sir John Conway Colthurst, a rather cretinous parliamentary follower of Lord Shannon, of whom it was noted in a 1773 list of MPs that  'he will always obey him (Shannon), a mere paltry fellow'.  The fact that the events did not attract straightforward reporting but were communicated by advertisements suggests the conduct of a highly personalised vendetta on both sides. If there had been a hearing at the assizes on foot of 'true bills', Morris would have referred to it in his statement in the autumn. Morris and the Muskerry Constitutional Society could only claim that bills of indictment had been lodged. While these were potentially damaging to a man 's character, they did not constitute authority for referring the charges to the assize judges. Moreover, there would be no further assizes till the spring. In offering rewards in the autumn, Morris and the Muskerry Constitutional Society seem to have gone beyond strictly legal limits in attempting to initiate further action well ahead of the March assizes of 1772. \n  Worse than an outlaw  \n The case had a number of intriguing features. O'Leary was never technically outlawed; Daniel O'Connell, the Liberator, was certainly wrong in claiming in 1834 that O'Leary was the last man shot as an outlaw in Ireland. In a sense the actual situation was even worse: if not outlawed under due legal process, O'Leary was subjected to an irregular attempt at outlawry not by a grand jury but by a tiny coterie, a step beyond the powers of individual magistrates. While bills of indictment had apparently been lodged, O'Leary repeated his August offer to stand trial in October 1771. This offer is crucial to understanding events at that time. The charge that O'Leary was  'under arms and on his keeping'  did not rest on a grand jury verdict, but was fabricated by Morris and the Society in October. As the law stood, a Catholic carrying arms would in itself warrant action by a magistrate because he would be committing an offence at the time of arrest. In the absence of a 'true bill' to answer, the attempt to represent O'Leary as an outlaw went both beyond the facts and the magistrates ' legal competence. Morris 's action in October was at best on the margins of legality. \n This situation produced a legal stalemate. Morris and the Muskerry Society were unable to turn their bills of indictment into 'true bills', while on the other hand O'Leary lived under the shadow of a trial or of arrest. While still free to come and go, O'Leary must have been apprehensive that Morris or others would attempt to arrest him on flimsy authority. He remained at liberty for two years, coming and going with impunity, and no effort was made to arraign him in court. There were no known legal developments at either the spring or summer assizes in 1772 or in the early spring of 1773. In 1773 the spring assizes in Cork began on 22 March and ended on 29 March. On 15 April, Daniel O'Connell commented that he was  'glad to hear our friend Arthur arrived safe'  implying that nothing untoward had occurred at the assizes. If O'Leary was in Cork city at the time of the assizes, he may have been there either to answer a case if 'true bills' emerged, or else to taunt his enemies for failing to get grand jury support. \n  O'Leary shot dead  \n Relations between Morris and O'Leary now deteriorated to a new nadir, with either party (we do not know which)    precipitating   the final tragedy. It is vitally important at this juncture to appreciate that Morris was not the high sheriff. Very probably, the proceedings at the spring assizes had been unseemly, and Morris may have kept the discredited charges alive. O'Leary 's death in 1773 was, however, in part of his own making: he took the initiative in seeking Morris out, and the folklore suggests that his intention was to kill him. In the event O'Leary himself was shot dead in suspicious circumstances by soldiers accompanying Morris. A coroner 's jury in June 1773 found Morris guilty of murder. \n O'Leary had obviously not lacked backing. In July 1773 a large string of political notables offered rewards for discovery of the person or persons who fired three shots at Morris at the window of his lodgings in Cork, but this was exclusively from the Shannon interest. Others, notably the powerful gentry interest of north Cork and the parliamentary members for the city, were conspicuously absent from the list. \n The furore over the shots allegedly fired at Morris in July was not generated by the need to protect his person from physical assault but rather to mount a legal defence (there is no evidence that Morris was seriously at risk, and even less evidence for the 1830s view that O'Leary 's brother had fired the shots). Urgency was imparted by the fact that the assizes were due to begin on 28 August. The coroner 's inquest had already decided that O'Leary had been murdered. Ironically whereas O'Leary had long faced the risk of a trial at the assizes, it was Morris who was finally tried, and on the much more serious charge of murder. In July the outlook for Morris did not seem good. He was stigmatised as the leading figure in a singular vendetta which had never enjoyed the backing of 'true bills' of indictment and the coroner 's jury 's decision in June was very damaging. Accordingly it was necessary for Morris 's defence to represent the alleged attempt on his life as serious; by deeming that rewards were necessary at national as well as local level, the murder case, it could then be argued, was not a dispute in which a magistrate had behaved badly but one in which he had lived under long-standing murderous threat. These considerations would influence the opinion of many attending the assizes, and could well weigh forcibly on the mind of a petty jury selected for the trial, especially if the full weight of the Shannon interest was engaged in lobbying for Morris. \n These convoluted matters finally came to an assizes hearing in September 1773 when Morris was tried. It was a singular occasion as the accused was a magistrate. His final acquittal, given pressure from the Shannon faction, could plausibly suggest improprieties in the court proceedings. The suggestion in the poem of the widow 's intention to seek justice in London is not irrelevant: the case against O'Leary had never been backed by the full grand jury and the notorious rewards offered in October 1771 were unwarranted, arising not from grand jury true bills of indictment, but from a novel twist of continued law-breaking introduced by Morris and his partisans.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d11c5843-66bf-41b0-9a5c-d7f0cab1cc0e", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.611896+00:00"}
{"text": "<Foundation of State>\n\n\n<$A>\n  Legitimacy of the state reinforced  \n Irish Catholicism in the 1920s sought, as one of its major objectives, to reinforce the legitimacy of the new state. The post-civil war political climate of Saorst&/at &/Eireann suited and reassured members of the Catholic hierarchy. They had lived through the dangers of the war of independence period between 1919 and 1921, witnessing the breakdown of law and order. A number of the hierarchy had even found their very lives threatened by elements in the British forces. The killing of three priests demonstrated that the clergy were not immune from the official government policy of reprisals during the 'Troubles'. Before the signing of the Truce on 9 July 1921, the majority of the Catholic hierarchy had shifted to a political position of tacit support for the constitutional wing of Sinn F&/ein. They supported the opening of peace talks with the British government and welcomed the signing of the Treaty on 6 December 1921. With the outbreak of civil war in 1922, the hierarchy sided with the Saorst&/at and roundly condemned the anti-Treatyites in a joint pastoral issued in October 1922. William T. Cosgrave was the President of the Executive Council between 1922 and 1932; he was a devout Catholic and a close friend of the Archbishop of Dublin, Edward Byrne. During the war of independence, he had put forward the idea of establishing a 'theological senate' - an upper house for D&/ail &/Eireann in which the Catholic bishops would sit to adjudicate on the orthodoxy of all legislation. But he did not seek to implement that idea when he took office in August 1922. In his personal life he was genuinely devout. He was given special permission from the Holy See to have an oratory built in his home where Mass could be celebrated. The Vice-President and Minister for Home Affairs, Kevin O'Higgins, was an ex-seminarian who had studied for the priesthood in Maynooth. The Minister for Finance, Ernest Blythe, was the only non-Catholic. However, it is important not to overstate this point. While the Cumann na nGaedheal ministers were quite distinctive in their political approaches - and the tensions between personalities were at times very pronounced - there was a tendency to reach consensus easily on church-state questions. The main objective of Cumann na nGaedheal was to strengthen the popular legitimacy of the new Irish state. \n Even if there is evidence that the bishops supported Cosgrave and his party in government, the hierarchy was not Cumann na nGaedheal at prayer. John Dignan of Clonfert was the first bishop to break ranks and publicly identify with de Valera 's anti-Treatyites. As his episcopal ordination in June 1924, he predicted that  'the Republican Party is certain to return to power in a short time',  a prediction realised in 1932. In the meantime, church and state worked in close harmony with little evidence of conflict. \n  Back to basics  \n There was general political approval for the hierarchy 's censorious attitude towards alleged sexual immorality in the Saorst&/at. The bishops frowned upon foreign fashion and modern dancing fearing that the moral laxity associated with Britain and the continent might reach Irish shores through the medium of cinema, radio and the British yellow press. Archbishop Harty of Cashel said on 25 April 1926 that the  'quantity of such horrible papers circulating in the country was simply appalling'.  On 9 May 1926 Archbishop Gilmartin of Tuam condemned foreign dances, indecent dress, company-keeping and bad books. He spoke of a  'craze for pleasure - unlawful pleasure'.  He warned that family ties were weakened and in other countries where there were facilities for divorce  'the family hardly existed'.  The hierarchy believed that native dancing had    salutary   powers:  'Irish dances do not make degenerates'.  Sex was, therefore, a matter of considerable concern to church and state alike in the 1920s. \n However, legislative initiatives on censorship, the curtailing of drinking hours and illegitimacy were not taken under pressure from the bishops. The Censorship of Films Act was passed in 1923; the Intoxicating Liquor Act was passed in 1924 and amended in 1927; the Censorship of Publications Act became law in 1929 and the Legitimacy Act in 1930. Bishops and politicians shared a conservative Catholic outlook which was also shared, in the main, by the leaders and members of other churches. The government sought the advice of the hierarchy and was usually decisively influenced either by the Archbishop of Dublin or by the bishops as body. \n  Divorce  \n The question of divorce revealed a pattern of relations between church and state which was to repeat itself in the 1930s. Before 1922 a divorce was obtained by private bill in parliament. Soon after independence, three private divorce bills were introduced. The Attorney General, Hugh Kennedy, sought a decision from the Executive Council as to whether legislation would be promoted to set up the necessary procedures. Cosgrave sought the advice of Archbishop Byrne and the bishops as a body. The hierarchy meeting in October 1923 stated  'that it would be altogether unworthy of an Irish legislative body to sanction the concession of such divorces, no matter who the petitioners may be'.  Cosgrave took note and standing orders were suspended to prevent such a bill being introduced into the D&/ail. Despite spirited opposition, the measure was upheld. Professor William Magennis summed up the contradictions in the debate:  'You cannot be a good Catholic if you allow divorce even between Protestants'.  There the matter rested until the introduction of Bunreacht na h&/Eireann in 1937. \n  Censorship  \n Since the foundation of the state, the Catholic Truth Society and a number of prominent clergymen had campaigned for stricter censorship laws. The Minister for Home Affairs, Kevin O'Higgins, set up a Committee of Enquiry on Evil Literature 1926. A Censorship Bill was introduced in summer 1928. Leading Irish literary figures, William Butler Yeats, George Bernard Shaw and George Russell all condemned the legislation. But their collective wrath and reputation were not sufficient to prevent the passage of the bill and the first censorship board was established on 13 February 1930. The committee had the power to prohibit the sale and distribution of 'indecent or obscene' books. The publishing, selling or distribution of literature advocating birth-control was also deemed an offence under the Act. \n Theatre in the Saorst&/at in the 1920s enjoyed freedom from censorship. However, when the Abbey Theatre performed Sean O'Casey 's  The Plough and the Stars,  there were vocal protests against the bringing of the tricolour into a public house and to the presence there of a prostitute, Rosie Redmond. The play ran for two weeks but with the lights on in the theatre and with garda&/i lining the passages at the sides of the pit. Conservatism remained a feature of most aspects of the Irish administrative, cultural and social life in the 1920s. The emphasis was on the need for continuity and conformity. \n  Education  \n Economic stringency, the close relationship of the government with the Roman Catholic Church and a state philosophy of minimal interference have been identified as three constraining factors on the development of educational reform in the 1920s, where the main emphasis was on curriculum rather than structural change. The Minister for Finance, Ernest Blythe, cut national teachers salaries by 10 per cent in 1923. This reflected the poverty of the country at the time. However, despite the limited state resources during their respective tenures, the two ministers for education Eoin MacNeill (1923-1925) and John Marcus O'Sullivan (1926-1932) were responsible for significant administrative initiatives. The department was created and its procedures established; systematic investigations were launched into various issues; a new secondary examination and curricular structure was devised; a primary certificate was introduced; a network of preparatory colleges was established; and legislation was successfully promoted on school attendance, the universities and vocational education. The Cumann na nGaedheal government established a model which the education system followed with minor modifications for almost forty years. The Catholic church played the central role in the development of a denominational educational system. The Church of Ireland was also provided with separate primary and secondary school systems and separate teacher-training facilities. The Jewish community operated schools in Dublin. The educational system was based on the religious pillars in the state. Through their involvement in education, the churches played a major role in the building of national character and identity. \n  Eamon de Valera: Catholic nationalist  \n Eamon de Valera, an abstentionist in Irish constitutional politics since the acceptance of the Treaty in 1922, founded Fianna F&/ail in 1926 and broke with his more intransigent Sinn Fein colleagues. He entered the D&/ail in 1927 and led the opposition until Fianna F&/ail was returned to power in 1932. De Valera was a Catholic nationalist. Temporarily out of favour with the Irish hierarchy since 1922, he had managed to restore his credibility among the younger Irish clergy by the late 1920s. Although he had never been perceived as a 'gunman' by the bishops, de Valera was held responsible for his poor judgement which had contributed to the outbreak of civil war in 1922. But collective episcopal hostility had waned towards 'the chief' by the time Fianna F&/ail entered the D&/ail. \n There was, however, a rump of the hierarchy who neither forgave nor forgot. But members of the hierarchy were, in the main, pragmatists. De Valera was somebody with whom they might soon have to work in government. The arrival of Fianna F&/ail in D&/ail /Eireann placed Cumann na nGaedheal under considerable political strain. Taking stock of its situation in 1929, it made a successful attempt to establish diplomatic relations with the Holy See that year. Paradoxically, this complicated relations between the hierarchy and the government. The bishops were very unhappy at the idea of having a nuncio resident in Dublin. Firstly, they feared that he would be running with tales to Rome all-too-frequently. Secondly, they believed that the nuncio might interfere with the process of episcopal appointments. Thirdly, they believed that British influence would be extended over the Irish church as a consequence of the perceived subservience of the Holy See towards the Court of St James. \n  The Dunbar-Harrison case  \n The government survived that storm. But the nuncio crisis of 1929 had given Fianna F&/ail an opportunity to demonstrate that Eamon de Valera was more sensitive to the feelings of the hierarchy on that matter than was Cumann na nGaedheal. The vulnerable position of the government also made it amenable to episcopal representations when the Legitimacy Act (1930) was being drafted. That legislation was strongly influenced by canon law. The Vocational Education Act (1930) was also drafted with a view to placating the hierarchy. However, all Cosgrave 's careful efforts not to alienate Protestant opinion was jeopardised by the Letitia Dunbar-Harrison case in 1930. After winning an open competition she had been appointed to the post of librarian for Mayo. She was a Protestant and an honours graduate of Trinity College, Dublin. When the local library committee refused to give approval to the appointment - a stand supported by the local county council - the government stood by the decision of the Local Appointments Commission, disbanded the council and kept Dunbar-Harrison at her post. Local clergy were outspokenly against her appointment. A Christian Brother M.S. Kelly argued that  'her mental constitution was the constitution of Trinity College'.  Mgr D'Alton of Tuam told the local library committee that they were not appointing a  'washer-woman or a mechanic but an educated girl who ought to know what books to put into the hands of the Catholic boys and girls of this county which was at least 99 per cent Catholic'.  \n The Catholic-Protestant communities had been driven further apart by the Lambeth Conference decision in 1930 on contraception. D'Alton stressed the difference between the two churches on birth control:  'supposing there were books attacking these fundamental truths of Catholicity, is it safe to entrust a girl who is not a Catholic, and is not in sympathy with Catholic views, with their handling?',  he asked. These comments echoed the profound mistrust that existed in 1930 at official level between the Protestant and Catholic churches.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "5aedbf1b-1bf3-4fc1-90e9-d1813b179012", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.612930+00:00"}
{"text": "<Crime - Initiative 92>\n\n\n<$A>\n  Rough Justice  \n  Brice Dickson  \n People sometimes claim that Northern Ireland is an over-researched society. They point to the myriad of books and articles devoted to the place and duly pronounce that very little else remains to be said. The truth is, nevertheless, that there is still some relatively unexplored territory. \n One of the fields which is most obviously in need of further research is that of criminology - the study of crime, criminals and criminal justice agencies. There is in fact a yawning gap in local knowledge about the exact nature of criminal activity in Northern Ireland, the kinds of people who commit crimes, their motivation, recidivism, and the impact of criminal behaviour on the condition of society in general. \n This ignorance is all the more remarkable given the level of violent activity in the North since 1969. It is almost as if the 'special' nature of that violence, its 'political' links, rendered 'ordinary' crime less worthy of attention. Now that politically motivated violence has mercifully receded, the time has surely come to look in more detail at the sorts of issues which have been the subject of debate in less divided societies. \n The mechanisms for conducting such studies are now in place. Unusual to give credit to a government department, the recent conversion of the Northern Ireland Office to the study of crime must be applauded. That office now publishes an annual research strategy and is positively on the lookout for projects to fund: its budget may be tiny compared with that of the Home Office, but at least the need for local research has at last been recognised. \n The NIO is also largely responsible for the establishment of an Institute of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Queen 's and for the funding of postgraduate studentships in criminology at both Queen 's and Jordanstown. Moreover, several officials from the Criminal Justice and Statistics Divisions of the NIO are strong supporters of the activities of the NI branch of the British Society of Criminology, which has been flourishing for the past three of four years. Each autumn the NIO sponsors a residential Criminal Justice Conference for some of the key players in statutory and voluntary agencies involved in the administration of criminal justice. \n The very fact that voluntary agencies are being allowed greater influence is an indication of the sea change on the part of the government. Organisations such as Extern, NIACRO, Victim Support and the Committee on the Administration of Justice are now actually solicited for advice on some issues, rather than sidelined as subversives or do-gooders. Statutory bodies like the Police Authority and the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights are beginning to recognise the value of consultation and public debate on criminal justice issues, even if they do not always ensure that these processes are fully inclusive (and even if they themselves are often excluded from such processes when initiated elsewhere). \n Not all bodies, however, are yet co-operative. The RUC is still fond of holding its own conferences while refusing to attend anyone else 's. Within the    recent   past the Independent Commission for Police Complaints has twice refused to participate in debates at the University of Ulster on what changes, if any, are required to the complaints system in Northern Ireland. The Crime statistics published in the Chief Constable 's Annual Report are not accompanied by any in-depth analyses, nor are the figures issued by the Court Service (again, the NIO 's Commentary on Crime Statistics is the best document available). The DPP 's Office still refuses to issue either public guidelines on    its   prosecuting policies or annual reports on its achievements. \n A great deal remains to be done. In particular, the results of the first ever Northern Ireland Crime Survey, which are currently being tabulated by the NIO, require detailed scrutiny. They need to be compared with the results of surveys taken elsewhere and with other equivalent figures taken in the North, such as social attitude surveys, which include questions on crime and policing. \n There also needs to be careful work on issues such as where crime is most prevalent, what conditions help it to flourish, whether punishments are effective in diverting offenders (particularly young offenders) from further illegal acts, and, most sensitively of all, what is the connection between 'ordinary' crime rates and paramilitary crime rates. The very definition of criminal conduct - whether victimless crimes such as drug-taking should be punishable - and what more can be done to combat white-collar crime should also be high on the research agenda. \n The question of the employability of persons with criminal convictions, especially in jobs that might bring them into contact with physically or emotionally vulnerable people, is very topical too. Following the report into the Martin Hurson case 1994, the government is at last about to issue guidance on using the DHSS 's Pre-Employment Consultancy Service, which maintains a register of 'suspect' employees. There are clashing rights at stake at this point, so it is to be hoped that the guidelines will be carefully weighted in the balance before any overly-invasive procedures are put in place. \n A recent book, on the proceedings of a conference held in the Old Museum Arts Centre in September 1994, casts valuable light on many criminological issues within NI. It contains a useful chapter by John Morrison on how misleading the 'official' crime statistics may be (the difference between recorded crime and actual crime is, as we know from the recent controversies provoked by Michael Howard 's conclusions based on the English figures, crucial) and Monica McWilliams explains how the masculinity and militarism of the RUC and paramilitaries are reflected, respectively, in the down-grading of domestic violence as a crime and the harsh treatment meted out to juvenile hoods involved in petty crimes. Ian Paisley Jnr reminds us that you do not have to be a nationalist to distrust the police, while John Brewer lists what he thinks are twelve salient features of policing in any divided society (to me not all of these are by any means inevitable) \n Two further chapters, one by Willie Thomson and Barry Mulholland, the other by the book 's editor Liam Kennedy, illuminate greatly the murky subject of paramilitary punishment shootings and beatings. The former concentrate on the mental health implications for victims of this 'informal' justice and in a nice reversal of the usual statistic trotted out on unemployment differentials, Kennedy observes that a male catholic nationalist, especially if young, working class and unemployed, is twice as likely to suffer assault and mutilation at the hands of paramilitaries as his protestant unionist counterpart. \n Despite its title, the book covers a lot more than crime in west Belfast, though it does tend to focus on crime linked to the troubles. At many points it raises more questions than it answers - a not unusual trait of conference proceedings. \n Kennedy 's book should be read in conjunction with another set of conference proceedings issued in October by the International Association of Juvenile and Family Court Magistrates, whose secretary is the super-efficient Dr. Willie McCarney of the NI Juvenile Courts Association. For years, Dr McCarney has been beavering away trying to publicise good criminological work in this Association 's Lay Panel magazine, which he edits. Last April 's conference was perhaps the most ambitious, and successful international criminological conference ever held in NI. It underlined the fundamental point that problems associated with juvenile crime here - with or without the paramilitary overlay - are not so different from those encountered in Brazil, France or the USA. Once again, the need for further detailed research was declared to be paramount. \n\n\n<$B>\n  It 's all the fault of the working class...  \n Having been out of the country for a few months, I canvassed acquaintances about how much they knew about Initiative '92 and the Opsahl Commission,  Fiona Stelfox writes  . Many knew very little and some were negative about the whole idea. Perhaps they were part of the silent middle classes highlighted in many submissions as having abdicated their civic duty. \n Two themes scream from the pages of the report. The first is the utter disenfranchisement of all Northern Ireland society - neither side can claim this as their own any more. From the most trivial to the most fundamental matters, we do not make our own decisions. The result is the breakdown of the framework through which people usually participate in a democratic society. It does not even seem to occur to us to participate in anything like the numbers one would expect in a healthy democracy. Many authors of submissions were crying out for someone to address the 'bread and butter' issues which affect their lives. Let us hope that the politicians who, as was rightly pointed out, never have to make the difficult decisions (like the closure of a hospital), listen to these voices. \n The second theme is the manifest common sense and pragmatism of the submissions - in contrast to the empty posturing of many Northern Irish politicians. The Sinn F&/ein issue was a good example: it was pragmatically recognised across the board that to attempt a settlement without the involvement of Sinn F&/ein was, at best, wishful thinking and, at worst, prolonging the violence. The people who have borne the brunt of this conflict, like the north Belfast women who made an oral submission, are the ones calling most loudly for a pragmatic approach. It is only the middle classes who can afford to stand on their esoteric principles, vowing never to give an inch of the ground that someone else is having to die to keep. \n These two themes present a challenge to us all. The people who contributed to Initiative '92 showed a sophistication of political analysis which one has yet to hear from most Northern Ireland politicians - but then we elected them. This raises the question of the Westminster electoral system, which, as was pointed out, contributes to division by wasting the votes of all those not cast for the winning candidate. The results in an average English constituency are bad enough, but in Northern Ireland it is much, much worse, with one ethnic/religious grouping frequently feeling effectively unrepresented. \n Of course, the best systems are only as good as the people who operate them. We are still left with the problem of how we 'feel' about each other - a very real problem, highlighted in many submissions. As Prof John Darby points out, there is nothing inherently wrong with conflict: what is wrong is that we seem unable to resolve conflict without violence. Part of the explanation clearly likes in mistrust between communities and we are only going to be able to overcome that by beginning to experience each other in ways that challenge pre-existing prejudices and misconceptions. The widespread support for cross-community initiatives and, in particular, for integrated education indicates that many are keen to seek the opportunity to experience each other differently. \n Whatever the specifics of the submissions, the Opsahl Report is an inspiring and heartening read. The process has clearly been beneficial, creating a forum which allowed people to participate. Perhaps we are eventually reaching the conclusion that we in Northern Ireland are not a 'problem', but a people struggling through the painful process of trying to shape our society for the future. Having lived abroad for the last few months, I returned with the feeling that our 'problems' are not as bad as in other places. On the contrary: we have initiated many ideas which could offer lessons to others. \n Initiative '92 has shown that the will to take responsibility for our destiny is there. But it needs a valve through which it can be articulated. We are making the choice to begin our sentences with  'A possible way forward might be...'  instead of  'The problem is...'  The next step is for our politicians to do the same.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "50dc0479-4938-4512-b4ca-88479e5dd069", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.613937+00:00"}
{"text": "<Community - Policing>\n\n\n<$A>\n  Community charged  \n  Malachi O'Docherty  \n Whenever I hear the word community, I smell a rat. When I hear about a concerned community, I wonder about all the people who are dismissed as unconcerned. \n The arrogance of Julie Burchill in recently describing herself as  'an important member of the gay community'  was transparent, but by what right was she traduced by other gays as less part of that 'community' than themselves? Who decided that gays are a community? Who decides that some gays properly belong to that community and some not? \n The answer perhaps lies in a notion of community as activity rather than as merely a collection of related people. Not all gays know each other, but most, presumably, have shared interests; in their legal rights, in the provision of service, in modes of sexual enjoyment that spill over into fashion and music. \n The black community in parts of England is concerned to be seen as law abiding. So when Paul Condon announces that most muggers are black and male, there is outrage, but there is also a rallying of 'community leaders' to the support of the police. Bernie Grant says:  \"I call on people to co-operate with the police. No one will make a fuss if the right people are arrested for the right reason\".  \n Kenan Malik, writing about this in  The Guardian  said community was the new buzz word whose values hide the new language of racism. \n Malik regards the black community    as   having been given the job, by the police, of criminalising those among it who are not deemed \"respectable\". \n Community is a term of simplification and generalisation which washes over all distinction and enables the silliest and most dangerous political thinking to pass off as credible. \n It might be a serviceable tool by which gay activists and blacks can campaign for legislative change in their favour, where they have a 'community of interests', but I smell fascism when I hear the word community. I hear someone claiming to represent people like me or unlike me, and inviting me to decide whether I am in or out. \n The word 'community' is rarely used to refer to a group of people living in a defined area. In Northern Ireland it is almost always used to refer to the 'unionist community' or the 'nationalist community', terms which clearly exclude huge numbers of people in the very areas referred to. \n The most blatant example of this exclusion was the rigging of the meeting of the Lower Ormeau concerned Community on July 11th, called to decide on whether to try to stop the Twelfth parade of the Ballynafeigh District Lodge of the Orange Order, on the following morning. \n At least a third of the people there applauded speakers calling for the parade to be allowed to go ahead, but the two thirds who roared and whistled and stamped their feet in support of protest were represented to the excluded media (two reporters sneaked in anyway) as representing the whole community. \n Gerard Rice said no vote was necessary and then went off and told the media that there had been a unanimous decision in favour of blocking the parade. \n The result was that those who had gone there to vote against a protest, achieved nothing other than to enhance the impression of support for the view they had gone there to oppose. It was an incredibly optimistic endeavour for so many Lower Ormeau people to try to argue for letting the odious Orangemen through. Having seen how \"community democracy\" works, they may prefer to stay away next time. Then the Concerned Community really will be able to risk a vote and be confident of unanimous support. \n Politically directed action is routinely described in the Northern Ireland media as an expression of community feeling. Dick Grogan, writing in the  Irish Times  about the meeting the Pilot 's Row Community Centre which decided to protest before the Apprentice Boys parade on Derry 's Walls said that only fifty people attended the meeting, but that their view was sure to have widespread support. \n How was he to know that? The direction of the protest was managed by Sinn F&/ein, which is a minority political party in Derry - though sometimes you would hardly know that, given the current self effacement of the SDLP. \n Similarly, when paramilitaries smash up homes, break legs and arms, order people out of the country, this is expressed by their spokespeople as the actions of the community, \"the community defending itself\", never as arising from the conscientious decisions of political operators who are working to defined goals. \n As with the notion of the gay community or the black community as an organic representation of all gays and all blacks, here in Northern Ireland political groupings have been able to appropriate the notion that they are the whole of the community that they arise from, represent it entirely and even define who has the right to live on their patch, or march through it. \n This is a triumph for propaganda. \n Paramilitaries and political parties puff themselves up until they seem the size of whole geographical areas. Entire denominations of religious belief, including the lapsed and the disillusioned are taken to represent single communities of political aspiration, and it seems to be in no one 's interest to question this. \n For instance, the loyalist paramilitaries rationalised attacks on random Catholics through attributing IRA support to a nationalist community. The IRA was hardly going to argue with that and say,  \"But hang on, only a few support us\"  . They were arguing also that their support extended beyond the Sinn F&/ein vote, and cited the passive co-operation of Catholics who declined to stand up to them as evidence of this. \n Unionist and British government politicians have been arguing for decades that the solution to the problem of violence was for the communities to give up the gunmen, making similar assumptions about the organic unity of the paramilitaries and the people they lived among. They were all overlooking a complexity in the populations of areas like West Belfast and Rathcoole and Mid Ulster, and it seemed to no one 's political advantage to correct them. \n Loyalists, likewise, could rationalise that they represented whole communities that did not vote for them by arguing that their political aspirations were served by larger parties. The votes of those who supported the killings went to the DUP or the Ulster Unionists. Republicans were perfectly happy to agree with this excuse because it confirmed their own vision of a monolithic Protestant bloc that sought only to exterminate Catholics. All prods were the same, you could trust none of them. \n Mary Holland, writing in the Irish Times, anticipated the West Belfast Festival:  \"One has the impression of a community proud of its history and traditions and confident of its own ability to make further progress, even to the extent of crossing the psychological barriers which still divide the people.\"  \n In other words, the forging of a coherent community identity is a means to making peace with others, if only they would get on with forge their identities too. \n Earlier Mary had written of the failure of Shankill Protestants to take pride in the achievements of Michael Longley, Van Morrison, Glenn Patterson and Derek Mahon. \n This is trite drivel. People can decide for themselves whether or not to like Michael Longley.It would be hard to reason, without being absurdly sectarian, that just because you are a Protestant from the Shankill you should take pride in him as one of your own. \n And it is cruel that the people who do not imagine conveniently agreed identity of the imagined community are regarded as non-existent.\n\n\n<$A>\n  Fear and loathing on the Falls Road  Malachi O'Doherty \n When a pregnant woman was viciously raped on the Falls Road recently, the area recoiled with shock. The following afternoon, a woman in a taxi office told the story of what had happened. \n  \"They reckon they 'll get him fairly quickly,\"  she said.  \"Who will get him?\"  I asked her. She paused before answering, making it clear who 'they' really were.  \"The police,\"  she said, preferring to be discreet. \n That night the Royal Ulster Constabulary said it was getting a very helpful response to its inquiries. On the Falls this statement, which would have been perfectly normal anywhere else, sounded like propaganda: if people were co-operating with the police, and the police with the people, then that - to the cynical eye - was something new. The hearts-and-minds work, particularly among women, that it takes to catch a rapist in a ghetto isn't easy where police must move in armed clusters. \n On that same night, 'they', the other police force, went round the clubs and bars looking for the rapist. A man who had been drinking in one club said:  \"It was just like a police raid. They came in and everybody went quiet. Nobody mentioned it, but they walked round all the tables looking everyone in the face.\"  \n Whatever people on the Falls Road want in terms of criminal investigation and punishment, what they expect is for the IRA to be the most prominent policing agency. \n And, whatever social attitudes surveys and police figures say about support for the police among northern Catholics, the feeling in the prime ghetto areas is still that the police are alien and dangerous - a feeling not confined to supporters of the IRA. There is evidence of intense exasperation among people who want normal policing, and who have broken with the prevailing political culture to demand it. \n I stood out on the Falls Road for an hour one night just after the rape and I asked people going by if they thought there was a lot of crime there. Most of the answers were from men; women wouldn't speak to me. It was no way a scientific poll, but after about 20 interviews three divergent answers were clearly recurring.  'No. There isn't much crime here at all,'  said some. \n  'Yes,'  said others,  'there 's a lot of crime. Muggings, joyriding and drugs.'   'Does anyone do anything about it?'   'Yes, the IRA does.'  \n The third response, as common as the second was:  'Yes, there 's a lot of crime. There 's bombings and knee-cappings and robberies.'   'Does anyone do anything about it?'   'No.'  \n It is not simply that the police neglect the area and that people generally turn to Sinn F&/ein. There are a lot of people on the Falls, it seems, who will tell a stranger if asked how much they detest the IRA. Many of these same people accuse the police, too, of abusing the area. \n Last month, on the day after Const Allen Moore shot dead three people in the Sinn F&/ein office - as much a police station to many people as an advice centre - Senior Asst Chief Const William McAllister told journalists that he trusted that the sensible people of the Falls would understand what had happened, would see it as an isolated incident and would not let it dent their faith in the RUC left to be dented. \n A senior social worker told me that he had been in community group meetings where one person had wept with shame at having reported thefts of property to Sinn F&/ein.  \"I know,\" he said  \"that if I saw a car being stolen out there on the street and called the police they probably wouldn't come for hour. People go to the ones who get results.\"  \n Charlie Bonner is a haulier from the wealthier part of upper Andersonstown. His son is a joyrider. Charlie has scars on his hands from injuries he received trying to grapple his son out of a moving car. He walked the streets at night looking for his boy.  \"Between the Provos and the police,\"  he said,  \"no-one was any use to me.\"  \n Mr Bonner 's son has a limp from a past knee-capping. He says he has tried to be reasonable with both the police and the Provos - to come to an arrangement that would help his reckless son, and not simply expose him to violence and abuse. Several times in past weeks he has been to court to see his son remanded in custody. Each time he has been offered bail. He has repeatedly refused it because his son is under an 'exclusion order' from the IRA and it isn't safe to bring him home. \n If that sounds like the IRA extending its policing role to indirectly confining people in state institutions, Brendan...from Ardoyne in north Belfast has a much clearer case of the same kind of thing. He was told by Sinn F&/ein to have his two sons aged 12 and 15 put in care. He achieved this by having social service apply for a place of safety order. The boys were sent to St Patrick 's training school where they met other boys on similar sentences. \n The order on Brendan 's sons was for a full year. He asked the north Belfast Sinn F&/ein councillor Joe Austin to help him get his boys back. Mr Austin visited the boys in St Patrick 's and interviewed them there. He then told Brendan that the threat would be lifted - for weekends only. St Patrick 's accepted this and allowed the boys home. After Christmas, Brendan 's sons were given permission by Sinn F&/ein, mediated via Mr Austin, to stay home full-time. So sentence was passed and commuted from inside the Sinn F&/ein advice centre in Brompton Park. \n  \"Sinn F&/ein sentenced your sons to a training school, then gave them time off for good behaviour,\"  I said to Brendan.  \"Isn't that amazing?\"   \"Yes\",  he said.  \"But someone has to do something about delinquents here.\"  Mr Austin confirmed most of the details. \n There never has been 'normal' policing, whatever that is, in west Belfast. It is 'counter-terrorism' that debases police work now. It is naked physical danger that has turned police stations into fortresses, but there is no precedent of acceptable community policing by the RUC to which west Belfast could return. \n The most common complaint about the handling of crime by the RUC is that it is more interested in recruiting informants than in stopping joyriding and theft. \n The Brian Nelson informer case (  Fortnight  303) might be the most dramatic case of undercover counter-insurgency. Few on the Falls believe the otherwise broadly accepted view that Mr Nelson 's job was to undermine loyalist paramilitaries from inside and save lives. From the Catholic ghettoes it looked simply like a plot to kill republicans. \n The controversial element of the case - that the normal working of the law has to be waived for intelligence-gathering - was not a revelation to people who believe they live among hundreds of small-time informers who are absolved of petty crime in return for services to the police. There is a huge amount of evidence that young 'hoods' are recruited to watch Sinn F&/ein members and report on their movements. \n The chief body of evidence is the accumulated newspaper files of 'outings'. An 'outing' for an informer is his life-saver. He - it is usually he - declares publicly that he has been recruited by the police and gives details of how this was done, often through a press conference organised by Sinn F&/ein. A scan of the files of disclosures by informers in cuttings from  <&Irish> An Phoblacht </&Irish>  of the  Irish News  suggests that many young people are pressurised into this kind of work, by a combination of bribes, threats and offers of charges against them being dropped.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6df01e79-ed7f-4fdf-953f-bffaaf97e412", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.614849+00:00"}
{"text": "<Peace and justice>\n\n\n<$A>\n  Peace, with justice  \n The Commission on Social justice, set up by the late British Labour leader, John Smith, in December 1992, reported in late October. It had received some 450 submissions and held 12 outreach visits around the UK, as well at 16 full commission meetings and as many again of policy panels. \n The commission 's 400-page report was described variously as dry and dense, and rambling and thin. For some on the right, it represented an expensive wish list, while for the radical left it was a revolution that wasn't; the centre left, however, saw it as a solid basis for planning into the 21st century. The report received almost no coverage in the Northern Ireland media, demonstrating what a long road remains to be travelled in creating a 'new news' - as some broadcasters apparently call the post-ceasefires agenda. \n No member of the commission expected it to have the impact of the Beveridge report, even though it was described as  'rethinking Beveridge'  . The national and international scene is too complex and fast-changing for a single report today to have such enduring impact. Even more important, though, were the greater consensus in the 30s and during the war on how to develop a welfare society, the post-war expectation of low living standard and privation, and the tolerance of high taxation the war had established. By contrast, the problems the commission sought to address were the lack of consensus of the 80s and 90s, and the associated intolerance of high public expenditure and taxation. \n That lack of consensus today owes everything to the huge growth in inequality over the last 15 years, primarily market inequality. The Beveridge welfare state proved ineffective in ameliorating, still less reducing or preventing, inequalities originating in the market. Even if the value of social security benefits had been maintained in relation to average earnings over the 80s and 90s, inequality would still have grown enormously. The lesson we should have finally learnt is that tax and benefit transfers alone can have only limited effectiveness, set against market inequalities. Cash benefits have not proved the answer to social injustice and exclusion and neither has that other hope of the post-war welfare state - the education system. \n Once seen as providing the key to equality of opportunity, the education systems of England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have all failed to overcome the disadvantages experienced by many of family and class. Northern Ireland has both the best and the worst record within the UK - the best GCSE and 'A'-level results and the highest proportion of unqualified school-leavers. A quarter of the 1991-92 school-leavers in Making Belfast Work areas let with no GCSEs (18 per cent in Northern Ireland as a whole). One in seven and one in five young adults in the UK as a whole have problems respectively with basic literacy and numeracy. The UK is the only developed country, apart from Russia, still to have a school-leaving exam at 16. And it is not coincidental that the children of unskilled manual workers are one-tenth as likely to go to university as those of professionals. \n Although many of the 'chattering classes', in their responses to the report, sought to defend 'free' university education, on grounds of equality of opportunity, the very different starts in life that people have mean some are very much less likely to benefit from 'free' higher education than others. Meanwhile, many are unable to benefit from vocational education and training due to unresolved literacy and numeracy problems, carried over from school into adult life. That is why the commission regarded extension of free education earlier into a child 's life (universal nursery education for all three- and four-year-olds by the year 2000) and literacy and numeracy guarantees (with appropriate quality reading and numeracy recovery schemes for primary children) as more important public expenditure priorities than expansion of - partially free - higher education. \n The problem of a minority of young people still leaving the education system at 16 requires, first, radical unifying of 14-18 vocational and academic education through a modular baccalaureate (as against the divided NVQ/GNVQ/A-level system) and, secondly, maintenance allowances for young people from the lowest income households in the 16-18 age group, whether they stay on at 'ordinary' schools or attend sixth-form or further education colleges. Without this, all the 'free' higher education in the world will fail to erode the increasing divide between people with no qualifications and those with some, in terms of adult life-chances and the capacity to exert control over one 's life. \n Post-18 vocational and academic education and training should be similarly addressed. The commission proposed a Learning Bank, with individual learning accounts - first, for all future 18-year-olds and long-term unemployed people and long parents on benefits, gradually extending to other vulnerable groups of the population, and finally including everyone. People would be able to choose the form of their entitlement - full-time, part-time, in a single three-year span or spread over any number of years in blocks - to suit them. This would level the playing field between the vocationally and academically oriented, between those from manual and white-collar backgrounds, between early and somewhat later developers, and between those who need to reconcile education with family commitments and those who do not. \n Such a massive expansion could not be cheap or easy. But about 10 per cent of jobs in Europe are destroyed each year and, in such a world, the obsolescence of human capital is a serious threat. Basic literacy and numeracy, and second and third (and even more) chances of education and training will be as fundamental to social justice in the 21st century as unemployment, sickness and invalidity benefits have been in the 20th. \n The commission proposed that state support would take the form of individuals being credited in their Learning Bank accounts with four-fifths of the average fees of a three-year course in higher education. \n They would borrow the remainder of any fees needed and their income maintenance, the maximum for which would be higher than the current combination of grants and student loans. This debt would be repayable only if the person 's investment in the education and training paid off - for example, when they reached average earnings - and repayment would be put on hold should their earnings fall below average again. Probably the most efficient and fair mechanism would be a surcharge on national insurance contributions. \n The failure of the UK education and training system has not only been the enduring class differences in qualification and occupational levels but also the inability to produce internationally competitive skills and qualifications. This, in turn, is related to the growth of long-term unemployment and low-wage, insecure and unprotected employment, which, combined with more restricted access to social security benefits, have led to a 17 per cent fall in the real incomes of the poorest 10 per cent of the UK population between 1979 and 1992 - when average incomes rose by 36 per cent. \n At the 1994 Conservative conference, the employment secretary, Michael Portillo, triumphantly proclaimed the 'success' of Britain 's deregulatory employment and social policies:  \"Work has changed, changed, completely and changed forever,\"  he said. Mr Portillo 's 'success' has been low job growth and deteriorating wages and security of employment, at least 40 per cent of which is now part-time, casual or self-employment, mainly in the non-tradeable - that is, non-international - sector. \n These are issues in which Northern Ireland has a strong stake. More than a quarter of its registered unemployed have been jobless for more than three years; in MBW areas, this rises to a third. Northern Ireland has also the lowest manual wages in the UK and probably a higher proportion of employers offering work premised on the availability of social security benefits to top up low-wage, insecure, casual or part-time employment. \n The wage system, as much as social security, is an expression of social relations and this is most evident in the non-tradeable sector. This has long been recognised in Japan, where a high-productivity tradeable sector has been used to expand job opportunities at reasonable pay in the 'home', non-tradeable sector. Here, the commission proposed minimum wage legislation; employment protection legislation to apply after six months employment instead of two years, to part-timers as well as full-timers; and gradual replacement of family credit and income support, which depress rates and labour supply, by a modern and more comprehensive social insurance system, including part-time benefits. These aim to redress the balance between the tradable and non-tradeable sectors, clarify the responsibilities of employers vis-&\\a-vis the state, and reassert the social nature of employment in such services as parks, caf&/es, bars and private households. \n The failure to recognise and value work in the non-tradeable sector has not only affected most people 's quality of life but has helped long-term unemployment to accumulate. To tackle exclusion from the labour market, the commission recommended a Jobs, Education and Training programme. JET would seek to create a high-quality, active, customer-oriented Employment Service. The aim would be to put education and training for the long-term unemployed people who wish to move into self-employment, to offer lone parents additional help with childcare, and to develop intermediate labour markets - combining training and education with not-for-profit employment - particularly through the use of benefits as wage subsidies. \n Such UK-wide programmes, however, tend to be less effective in the most disadvantaged regions beset by multiple disadvantage. There are many area-based examples of good practice and innovation - some in Northern Ireland - but most are inhibited by short-term, inadequate and often restrictive funding criteria. Overall, too much money is still being spent on property-led, city-centre development, and too little on people-led, community development. \n The commission proposed funding of Community Development Trusts of locally-elected people from small areas - about 5,000 households or 10,000 people - so that communities could influence regeneration. Initially, these would cover the 250 most    disadvantaged   areas of the UK, and the programme would have a lifetime of ten years. This would reach 2.5 million people, probably a quarter of the unemployed and proportionately more long-term unemployed. Each CDT would be granted <*> pound sign </*> 100 per resident per year, up to a maximum of <*> pound sign </*> 1 million. In addition to these funds, CDTs could draw on wage subsidies to develop intermediate labour markets. Their success would be judged by improvements in the quality of life and environment of their areas. There would be an employment spin-off but that should not be the principle measure of performance, and certainly not the sole criterion for funding. \n The commission 's proposals reject the Fabian notion that governments know better than citizens what they need. Accommodation to the world of rapid and complex social and economic change, as well as participative democracy, require devolution of political power - implicit in the commission 's proposals on community regeneration and the Learning Bank. But neither the social and economic policies the commission recommended, nor such associated devolution, conforms to the non-interventionism (in the market) and centralism (in formal politics) of recent Conservative administrations. \n Indeed, more and more power has been drawn to Westminster and this must be reversed - through devolved political assemblies in the four components, and ultimately all the regions, of the UK. Yet, whether or not Scotland and Wales achieve devolution, an assembly in Northern Ireland may occur. And it might be permitted to adopt more interventionist economic and social policies: the UK government has itself been much more interventionist in the region. \n As it should be. To build an inclusive society in Northern Ireland, through such social and economic policies as proposed by the commission - as well as through the formal political process - must be a prerequisite of peace with justice.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "435bee31-e42d-4138-88c2-7680c736ee52", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.616243+00:00"}

Advice is nearly always free, and, importantly, non-judgmental. \n The first port of call for most students with a problem is their Students ' Union. \n The unions have several, frequently full-time officers who can offer advice on welfare, housing, accommodation etc. They also have an extensive network of advisers on which to draw upon. \n The education officer, for example, can advise on changing courses, difficulties and delays in obtaining a grant, postgraduate courses, funding and even changing colleges. \n If an academic situation has become so bad that you are up before the beak (your faculty progress or disciplinary committee), the education officer can help you make a case out of something other than bursting into tears and hoping for the best. They can also be present at the committee hearing. \n With grants and accommodation becoming worse, officials dealing with student welfare are finding their workload increasing. \n Queen 's Students ' Union has improved its service this year with the introduction of the Welnet computer database. The system contains information on accommodation, employment and finance. \n The idiot-proof system can print a CV, a useful little item in the big world. \n The Student Counselling Service can also provide a helpline. The service provides a confidential, friendly and professional service with fully-trained counsellors. As well as practical help, student counsellors are also trained to deal with more complicated personal and emotional problems from depressions to bereavement. \n Methods are based normally on non-directive counselling. It is strictly confidential unless the student is agreed that information may be given to another person if he or she believes it would help overcome the problem. \n In the excitement of leaving home and moving into a new environment, the issue of health is sometimes forgotten. It is easily done, but health should not be neglected. \n Both universities require medicals from their freshers. It is a good idea to register with their health services as well, or with a GP. Colleges offer the same full range of health care cover as the local health centre. \n An increasing concern is the health of students when they are away over the summer, either on holiday, field trips or gaining experience. \n College medical staff are also on call when needed. \n For those who would rather speak with fellow students in complete confidence, there is the Nightline service. It provides someone to talk to over the phone at night from 8pm to 8am. From 8pm to 10pm you can also call in at 41 University Street. (This address is likely to change over the next few months.) \n Both universities have an extensive network of chaplains covering most major religions. Up-to-date details can be found in the universities ' handbooks. \n While drink is taken to be as much a part of university life as exams, alcohol can cause serious problems for students. The Northern Ireland Council on Alcohol offers and education service to guide students at either 40 Elmwood Avenue, Belfast (0232) 664434, 461 Falls Road, 330499, or 219 Albertbridge Road, 731602. \n The Samaritans have an outstanding record in dealing with problems of health, relationship or bereavement worries 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. \n The organisation provides a listening ear in complete confidentiality. The caller 's name is not needed. They will listen to anyone with any kind of trouble that may be bothering them. They also welcome callers for talk on a one-to-one basis. \n There are branches throughout the north. The Derry number is 265511, Coleraine 320000 and Belfast 664422. \n It 's important to remember that no matter how big or small the problem, there is someone who can offer advice or an ear. It may be a cliche, but a problem shared is a problem halved. \n\n\n<$B>\n  educate to liberate: women find freedom  \n women get some degree of equality at university, says maeve quigley, but they need to play an active role in their students ' union to ensure they get an equal say \n UNIVERSITIES are probably the only places in existence where women have achieved some significant degree of equality. \n For years at school, in the home, in the workplace and elsewhere, women encountered some kind of marginalisation, so while they 're at university it 's important they make the best of their time. \n Most women find that university provides a lot more freedom than school, sometimes too much. You can be left behind by the university whirl unless you make a concerted effort to become involved, not just in your studies and social life, but in the countless clubs and societies that your university and students ' union offer. \n It is essential that women involve themselves with the politics of their union, as, just like any other political arena, student politics is essentially a male-dominated pastime due more to social conditioning in second-level education rather than to the political structure of the students ' union itself. \n The problem with this is that if more women do not start attending Union General Meetings (UGMs) and standing for council and sabbatical elections, policies on abortion and women 's rights decided by a majority of men who, even though they may be the most PC males on the planet, still can't fully understand what being a woman entails. \n Inside your students ' union you may well find a women 's group, but before you dismiss it as being full of short-haired, bra-burning, men-hating feminists, why not go and see for yourself. You 'll be pleasantly surprised to find a group of people around your own age who just get together to discuss issues relevant to female students, and not a dungaree in sight! \n Probably the most important issue for a woman at university is safety. Over the past few years sexual attacks have been becoming more and more prolific in and around the universities, around the halls of residences and on the campuses themselves. As recently as mid-September, the welfare office at Queen 's University issued a warning to prevent female students desperate for accommodation leaving their addresses and telephone numbers on notice boards for their own personal safety. \n But at Queen 's Students' Union, safety for women is high on the agenda, as Welfare Officer Alison Ahern explains:  \"There is a feeling that the streets are more dangerous for women than before. \n \"Here we are constantly putting up posters for the Rape Crisis Centre and Nexus to remind victims of sexual attacks that they can find support. \n \"The Women 's officer and myself can be approached at any time for help on matters to do with pregnancy, sexual harassment or any other problems that are causing difficulties for the student.\"  \n For their own personal protection, female students are advised to get a personal safety alarm at the beginning of the year. These are readily available from the Queen 's Students' Union shop at discount prices. \n They have been recommended by the police as from the union, and have the added feature of a panic button. Queen 's also runs a women 's night-time minibus service seven nights a week. \n For your own protection you must always remember these safety rules: 1 Try not to walk anywhere by yourself in the dark. If walking in the dark alone: <*> bullet point </*> make sure you have a personal safety alarm <*> bullet point </*> carry your keys in your hand to defend yourself <*> bullet point </*> stick to well lit areas, and areas where it is likely to be busy <*> bullet point </*> always make sure that someone else knows where you are \n These are necessary safety precautions, but there 's no point in being too terrified to go outside either. For male and female students alike, socialising will play a very big part in your university career so the best advice that you can get is enjoy it while it lasts! \n\n\n<$C>\n bold> it 's tidy, it 's cheap - it doesn't exist  \n  Good houses are rare - and prices are rocketing. John Lappin looks at student accommodation  \n YES, there is a housing crisis this year and no, we can't give you any numbers to prove it. There is always a rush for flats and houses in September,    increasing   the underlying stresses in the student market. \n If you are a first-year you should be alright, having priority with the universities. If you are not, there is a greater chance you will be sleeping on a friend 's sofa or commuting from home in the back of beyond. \n    Statistics   are hard to find but the time it takes to get a flat gets longer each year. Estate agents have had to cope with students coming to their offices in tears because they can't find a flat. Welfare offices are under more strain while the Student Housing Association    Cooperative   (Shac), a non-profit-making housing organisation, has a waiting list stretching back to April in Belfast and to February in Coleraine. \n The days when if you were stuck at the start of term it was because you had stayed on two weeks too long at your summer job in America are long over. \n If you do find yourself without a roof over your head what can you do? The first thing is not to panic and make sure you keep in contact with your welfare officer and university accommodation office. But don't just depend on things being done for you. Keep looking at accommodation notice boards and in newspapers, ask your friends - many houses and rooms can be let through word of mouth. \n As for that little flat in Stranmillis with central heating, economy 7, microwave, jacuzzi, satellite TV, cocktail bar and charming balcony    complete   with climbing roses, and all for <*> pound sign </*> 80 a month, some Tory student at Queen 's probably got daddy to buy it for him. \n Queen 's Welfare Officer Alison Ahern was seeing 15 students a day a week before term began. She found an average price of <*> pound sign </*> 110 a month for a single room but with more students than ever paying from <*> pound sign </*> 85 to <*> pound sign </*> 110 a month for sharing a room. \n She said:  \"We 've just got the database up and running. We 're appealing to landlords to send us information about vacancies so we can advertise it as soon as possible. I let people use the phone so they can phone up quickly and let them know their rights as tenants but I can't build houses.\"  \n Accommodation manager at Queen 's, Conor Brown, had no worries about housing first-years but conceded that there was no enough student housing in Belfast. \n  \"The university intake is not as high as it was last year. At this time of year we specialise in first-year students. My impression is that this year is not as bad    as   former years,\"  he said. \n At the University of Ulster, Jordanstown and Magee seem to have less of a problem but many UUJ students choose to live in Belfast, increasing pressures on the city 's housing stock. \n There are difficulties in Coleraine, highlighted by Shac, who has encountered problems with rising student numbers and slower student turnover. The recession meant fewer jobs in their home towns or abroad so students worked near campus over the summer and held on to their houses. \n Another problem is that some bed and breakfasts insist that students clear out belongings at weekends and holidays to make way for other guests. \n Jan O'Neil, speaking for Shac in Coleraine, said new buildings were needed to squeeze the worst of the landlords out of the market but added that there were often objections to planning applications in the area. \n The greatest squeeze seems to be in Belfast. Houses are in demand not just from students but from former students now working in Belfast. In other cases landlords have sold up because the Housing Executive is enforcing multiple occupation regulations. \n Renovation has priced many houses and flats out of the student market. The background to this has been increasing student number in the last few years at both universities while new building programmes have not matched the increase, putting more pressures on the existing stock. Finally many English-based insurance companies have withdrawn cover from student houses and this has had some impact this side of the Irish Sea. \n Ray Cashell, director of Shac in Belfast, says:  \"There are a lot of different angles on this but at this stage we 're talking about a shortfall of several hundred people who have not an answer to their housing problem. People will tend to find somewhere but somewhere is often sleeping on a settee or doubling in a room.\"", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "af079042-b400-429b-bda9-9bb6e99d7b83", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.617143+00:00"}
{"text": "<Political future>\n\n\n<$A>\n  Beyond partitions  \n  It will probably only be when the people of the Shankill truly believe that the violence has ended for good that we will start to see a proper assessment of the last 25 years.  Continuing paramilitary activity in both communities, the controversy over traditional parades and the ongoing impasse over decommissioning means that people in areas such as Protestant west Belfast remain cautious. \n Nevertheless, since August 31 and October 13 as the weeks became months, optimism has increased in an inverse ratio to the level of tension. Many people are starting to believe that perhaps it is all over. \n Some of the changes in the community have been glaring. The army has vanished from the streets. The RUC now patrols the area in short sleeved shirts, without flak jackets. After a lengthy campaign Lanark Way has reopened. \n Initially it was the small things you noticed. No longer did you have to enter a cage, viewed by a small camera, before being admitted into the bar for a pint. Strange cars do not attract the same level of curiosity. Young people returning from the clubs in the city centre are more likely to walk home than before. A few shoppers from the Springfield and Falls Roads are returning to the Shankill to shop on a Saturday. \n However this may seem to be a small return for the cessation of a terrorist campaign which cost over 3,000 lives. There remains a serious community relations problem on both sides of the peaceline. A problem which may well exhaust the Community Relations Council before it is solved. There continues to be stoning incidents across the barriers which have been erected to keep the two sections of the community apart. \n It is worth bearing in mind that for the last 25 years we have been inflicting the most horrific crimes on one another. These wounds will not heal overnight. That notwithstanding, there is an increasing determination not to step back into the abyss. That, at least, is a start. We will have to build from the bottom up. \n In some ways the declaration of a cessation of violence has acted as a catalyst for a process which commenced almost one year earlier. The Shankill bomb saw the birth of a determination for a new start. At that time many of us thought that this would translate into a resolve not to be ground down by a traditional enemy. However, with the advent of a new era in October 1994 this resolution became one of no longer being prepared to accept the role of an alienated community. For a quarter of a century the Shankill had been marginalised in all but the news programmes. \n People started emerging, blinking into the light. It is now certain that Shankill residents will increasingly question the old certainties. The courage and dignity with which they faced the eye of the sectarian storm can now be turned towards delivering a better life for all within the community. This confidence should eventually lead directly to a normalising of relationships with our neighbours on the other side of the wall. It is in the attitudes of the people of the people on the Road that the peace has had the most tangible effect. There is a desire to make up for the loss of the last 25 years. This new vision, while born out of the tragedy of the Shankill bomb, would have been less likely to bear fruit if it had been forced to coexist with paramilitary violence. \n It is not in the small changes that we can see the effects of twelve months of peace. Rather it is in the certainty that the great potential of the Shankill and its people may at last be fulfilled. \n\n\n<$B>\n  Driving down the Upper Springfield Road, Belfast 's latest peacewall dominates the landscape, hovering over the people of Springmartin and Springfield Parade.  It is a monument to past and    present  fears, a continuing reality a year after the ceasefire. Perhaps, when all the other Belfast walls come down this last Great Wall of Belfast should remain. \n The wall reflects another reality of west Belfast - that the suffering inflicted and endured over decades cannot be demolished quickly. To have expected otherwise misunderstands the pain which burden so many, a pain that is acknowledged (if at all) only spasmodically by those who caused it. Last month 's 'VJ' commemorations confirm how long the healing process can be - our pain will take much time and thought to ease. \n The ceasefire, despite its year of traumas and turbulence, is firmly anchored among the people of west Belfast. They value it and support those who manage and maintain it - when it appears that it may unravel, a communal restraint appears, pulling it out of crisis. Falls Road republicans, having evolved policy and practice over the years, appear committed to 'a long peace'. Those who disagreed with the timing of the ceasefire of the leadership 's method of its achievement enjoy little or no sympathy for the argument (as they see it) that a return to war will bring more advantage. Shankill Road loyalists - whose political evolution requires more analysis - appear as the advance guard for new thinking within the wider unionist community. The US Administration affirms its commitment to the process by the expected visit of President Clinton in early December. The two governments prepare to re-focus their political strategy with the September Summit of which much is expected and much required. In short a potent cocktail of factors sustains the peace far greater than the totality of forces that may threaten it. \n Yet a sense of crisis exists. A political process so carefully crafted over the last decade urgently requires the impetus of governments. London 's strategy appears at best confused and at worst bloody minded. Issues that can be resolved - repatriation, release of prisoners, repeal of oppressive laws - are delayed or denied. For nationalists and others in west Belfast, these issues are essential tests of British good faith or bad faith. Broader issues (such as weapons and negotiations) compound doubts about British strategy, doubts that must be laid to rest at the September Summit by confirming the timing of inclusive negotiations and, perhaps, a structure for parallel discussions on all relevant issues. \n As we exit the season of marches and protests, for many in west Belfast recent police actions confirm the centrality of the policing debate, which so far, has been somewhat sterile. The Police Authority, marginal in influence and minimalist in intention, clashes with the RUC establishment, who cling to policies and a culture inappropriate to new policing needs. The Acting-Deputy Chief Constable, Ronnie Flanagan, perhaps more aware of the need for change, conducts a review in a political vacuum. Sinn F&/ein 's demand - 'Disband the RUC' - is a slogan and not a policy and offers few creative insights. The debate nonetheless has been energised by Seamus Mallon 's occasional forays and it is anticipated that the SDLP policy document, possibly published later this year, will enliven and enrich the debate further. However, without constitutional and institutional agreement and fundamental cultural change within the police and an agreed means of resolving conflict issues, the policing issues will run and run. \n The many warm phrases about tackling economic and social disadvantage in west Belfast must be translated into the hard facts of eroding disadvantage. On the Falls and the Shankill this task remains substantially unaddressed. The compelling political success of President Clinton 's US Investment Conference and the innovative strategy behind the European Peace and Reconciliation package, is the essential preamble to creating employment opportunities. This is understood and accepted 'on the ground' in west Belfast. \n However, the continuing indifference of most government agencies to redressing years of neglect and discrimination and the absence of any systematic strategy by the IDB for inward investment is alarming. This issue will be one of the touchstones of government intentions towards west Belfast in the second year of the ceasefire. \n It was Martin McGuinness who most narrowly misjudged nationalist political culture with his recent comment that in future negotiations, nationalists would have nothing to give because \"they had nothing to give\". In terms of jobs, justice and equality, there is validity in    his  assertion. But nationalists have much to give - we know that it is a long twilight struggle that brings change; that the political agenda has been enormously enriched by nationalist creative thought and that national confidence and international respect characterise our perspective. This is only part of what we have to give and what we have to give can be seen on the Garvaghy Road; by our building of inclusive politics; by our first articulating the equality and validity of unionist and nationalist traditions. This is a growing reality in west Belfast - that unreconstructed dogmas and demands of the past need to be redefined in a more relevant and accommodating way and that nationalists are well placed and informed to do so. \n An Italian once wrote:  \"There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct or more uncertain in its success than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things\"  . And the late US Senator Robert Kennedy added  \"Yet this is the task of this generation and the road is strewn with many dangers.\"  The past year of ceasefire confirms the truth of this. But everyday, everywhere, there are people who do not shirk the task of introducing new order of things. In West Belfast, as much as anywhere. \n\n\n<$C>\n  It takes two to consent  \n  Things have moved quickly since the joint declaration: it has acted as the catalyst for the IRA ceasefire and prompted the 'framework document', to be presented soon by the two governments, which can chart the way to new, stable political structures on the island.  When London and Dublin agreed last December  \"to remove the cause of the conflict, to overcome the legacy of history and to heal the divisions which have resulted\"  , they made a commitment to go to the heart of the problem. \n The test of the practical merits of the declaration and of the governments ' commitment will, however, be in their application to, and implication in, the political process, as reflected in the framework document. This is particularly true for nationalists, whose defining experience of Northern Ireland has been of exclusion, domination by unionism and all the inequalities that stemmed from majoritarian rule. \n The most certain political fact is this: nationalists in the north will never again accept a position where they are second-class citizens in their own land. Whatever their differences, there is a common resolve that never again will they accept the status of a subordinate and abused minority, formerly assigned to us by the combined weight of the British government and the unionist majority. \n That is why the focus of the declaration is, quite properly, the island as a whole. Yet there are still legitimate nationalist concerns, which centre on the so-called 'unionist veto'. They are tied up with the issue of 'consent' - that is, acceptance that there will be no change in the status of Northern Ireland without the consent of a majority of its people. \n In essence, the concern boils down to this: for as long as the Northern Ireland framework exists, given its unionist bias and inbuilt, tribal weighting in the unionists ' favour, how can nationalists expect equality and dignity? \n While the declaration lays stress on equal rights and 'parity of esteem', we need to know what these concepts will mean in practice. Is mere lip-service to be paid to the ideals and aspirations of nationalists, where the practical impact, as well as inertia, of the British administration weight in one direction only - that of the maintenance of the union? \n Similarly, is the aspiration to unity to be treated as irrelevant, unless and until the day the majority has actually voted it into reality? Or is it to be given real, operational expression and opportunity as a legitimate and worthy aspiration, as of now? If the people of Northern Ireland are not to be persuaded into Irish unity, they must also not be subject to hidden barriers and loaded preferences, bolstering up the unionist position and loading the dice between the two aspirations. \n There may no longer be a 'unionist veto' in the extreme sense which allowed unionist domination to go unchecked and unexamined for more than 50 years. There are, however, more subtle variants still around. \n There is the notion that the rights of nationalists must meet an unwritten test of unionist consent and approval. There is the notion that, notwithstanding the tribal make-up of Northern Ireland, the empowerment of nationalists would somehow be an infringement of the rights of unionists. There is the notion that the union is somehow the only 'real' dimension in Northern Ireland and that anything to do with nationalist aspirations is, in the last analysis an 'add-on'. \n If the unionist veto means the strong political influence of a coherent community of 900,000 people, then that of course is accepted. To deny it would be as futile as any other flight from reality. \n But he other notions should be dispelled and 'veto' and 'consent' precisely defined. We need to be assured that there is no veto over the policy of the two governments, and that neither is precluded from adopting or pursuing a policy in relation to the north of which unionists disapprove. Both governments enjoy a wider mandate and are entitled to consult the general good or set wider objectives, on this as on any other issue. They should put beyond doubt that their approach to Northern Ireland is based on a recognition that it is  sui generis  and that the needs of nationalists cannot be met or mediated through the inbuilt unionist majority. \n People should also recognise that nationalist consent is directed at the specific question of a change in the status of Northern Ireland. It should not be taken to imply a nationalist consent to a chain of logic that, because Northern Ireland is at present under United Kingdom jurisdiction, their consent must apply to everything that flows from that. There is a world of political difference between agreeing there will be no change of status without consent, and saying we consent to the present status. If that distinction is eluded, there will be no real dialogue with nationalism. \n Acceptance of consent is not a blank cheque for some unionist programme for Northern Ireland. We must all remember - especially the British government and the unionist parties - that the coin of consent has two sides, and the more clearly that is reflected in any new arrangements the more durable and stable they will be. Because Irish history, if it teaches us anything, teaches us that consent is the essential ingredient of stability.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ddf78f71-2df6-4523-9654-2eb63eb0af3a", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.618442+00:00"}
{"text": "<Smoking - Divorce>\n\n\n<$A>\n  Sex, lies and smoking  \n  All the ash trays were removed form the hotel in the coastal town of Newcastle, Co Down, where the world 's first International Conference on Women and Smoking was held last month.  \n The 150 delegates - 30 from women 's groups in Northern Ireland - had come to share experiences and develop international, national, local and personal action plans, to counter the smoking epidemic that claims around 300,000 female lives in the world per year. \n Organised by the Ulster Cancer Foundation, the Health Promotion Agency for Northern Ireland and the International Union Against Cancer, the conference was a sequel to the seventh World Conference on Smoking and Health, held in Perth two years ago. \n It was, said Pattie White, co-chair of the UK 's Health Education Authority, the fruit of a decade of pressure on the male-dominated tobacco-control movement - pressure from women to prove that  \"women smoke for different reasons from men\"  and should be treated and studied differently. \n This was the theme of the keynote address, by Ilona Kickbusch, director of Lifestyles and Health (Europe) at the Geneva headquarters of the World Health Organisation. Wearing a tobacco-brown suit and flame-orange polo-neck sweater, Dr Kickbusch, with her short greying hair, resembled a super-slim cheroot. \n Placing female smoking in the context of women 's lack of power in society and their daily role as childminders and housekeepers, she urged an  \"integrated response to the notion that health is created and lived by people within the setting of their everyday lives, where they learn, where they work, where they play and where they love. All these things are relevant to smoking.\"  She called for an emphasis on health promotion, both personal and societal, with a focus on low-income women, who smoked much more than their professional counterparts. \n The combustible Ellen Gritz from the University of California was equally appropriately clothed in an ash-grey suit. Quoting WHO figures in rapid-fire succession, she delivered a paper on the Health Effects of Smoking on Women in less time than it would take to say  'May I have a packet of Virginia Slims menthol ultra lights, please'.  \n Dr Gritz revealed that, while trends in lung cancer mortality were levelling off among men in developed countries, for women they were  \"astronomically sky-rocketing\".  In Scotland, Japan and the US, lung cancer had surpassed breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer mortality in women.  \"We do not know how to prevent breast cancer, but we do know how to prevent lung cancer and for this to happen is an abomination,\"  she said.\n Grace Burnside, deputy director of the Ulster Cancer Foundation, described the extent of this  \"preventable tragedy\"  in Northern Ireland: claiming one out of every six lives, tobacco killed more people than car accidents, suicides, illegal drug use, AIDS and the 'troubles' combined. Ms Burnside called for the targeting of at-risk age groups, through community programmes such as the successful peer-led Teenagers Against Smoking (TASK) and the classroom-based Smokebusters. \n Working groups on Raising Awareness and Involving Women in Tobacco Control shared a wide range of experiences from many countries. Scandinavians boasted about their smoke-free universities and hospitals. Indian delegates stressed prevention rather than cessation programmes in a context where tobacco chewing was more common than smoking and fewer than 5 per cent of women smoked. Doctors from the new democracies of central and eastern Europe spoke of the rapid growth in western tobacco advertising since the political upheavals of the late 1980s.  \"One of the great achievements of democracy,\"  remarked one Polish delegate wryly.\n This 'great achievement' was analysed further by Amanda Amos, a lecturer in health education at Edinburgh University.  \"The targeting of women entered a new stage in the late 1960s with the introduction of cigarette brands aimed exclusively at them,\"  Dr Amos said. Virginia Slims, Caprice and Eve were a few of the brands  \"made with women in mind\".  What they had in common was an emphasis on slimness, ultra-lightness and mildness - all perceived as desirable female attributes. She quoted the marketing chief of the company that produced Marlboro as saying:  \"I knew thinness was a quality worth talking about - it 's an American obsession.\"  \n While advocating a ban on tobacco advertising, Dr Amos argued that this would not necessarily lead to fewer positive images of women and smoking in magazines. On the cover of a recent Italian  Vogue  , Linda Evangelista had posed with a cigarette under the headline 'New Look for 92', and 19 pages in the same magazine had shown fashion models smoking. This \"worrying trend\" was also prevalent in British fashion magazines, like  Cosmopolitan  and  Vogue  , she said. \n Perhaps more worrying than the fact that cigarettes are used to control weight and suppress appetite was the suggestion by Lorraine Greaves from Canada that they were also used to supplant emotions. \n A sociologist who has worked with battered wives, Prof Greaves said women used smoking more for the  \"suppression of negative emotions\".  One woman had told her that smoking was like  \"sucking back her anger\"  , so she did not cause trouble. Prof. Greaves also spoke of the vital  \"bonding function\"  of women smoking together, particularly in an environment hostile to smoking. \n The conference closed with a demand for  \"a comprehensive, woman-centred global strategy, which will reduce the inequity women face and will unite and support them in action to prevent and reduce tobacco use among women and girls\".  There were pledges to lobby politicians and decision-makers, calls for alliances with journalists and editors to ensure their magazines were not consciously or unconsciously promoting smoking, a commitment to a follow-up conference in two years, closer networking in the interim, a plethora of local, national and international initiatives and the targeting of specific age groups and classes.\n No one, however, asked the surreptitious smoker who had been slyly puffing in the ladies ' loo for three days to declare herself. \n\n\n<$B>\n  Divorced from reality  \n  Two years ago Patricia Reilly was found guilty of bigamy.  She wept in a Dublin courtroom as the judge pronounced a nine-month suspended sentence, against which she is appealing. Living in a country where there is a constitutional ban on divorce, she married for a second time while her first husband still lived. Under section 57 of the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act, she thereby committed a felony, punishable by seven years penal servitude or two years imprisonment. \n According to the 1991 Labour Force Survey, there are 47,000 separated people in the republic, for most of whom divorce recognised by the state is not an option. The Divorce Action Group claims that many will not admit to being separated - it estimates that 60-70,000 people have parted from their spouses. \n Among them is Catherine. A mother of a six- and eight-year-old, three years ago she took out a barring order against her mentally and physically abusive husband, after he hit her across he face. \n The first physical assault came when Catherine was five months pregnant with their second child. But the mental torture had, she said, been going on a lot longer - until it reached the stage where  \"at 12 o'clock at night, when my husband had gone drinking, I 'd be running around with the hoover so that there would not be any crumbs on the floor\".  When he did return in the early hours, she was abused for producing dried-up food that had been cooked earlier that evening:  \"Naturally it would be dry at two in the morning.\"  \n With the barring order came custody, maintenance <*> pound sign </*> 25 a week until he lost his job - and weekly access to the children, supervised by her. She had two deeds of separation drawn up by solicitors, but on neither occasion did he arrive to sign the documents. Her council house is now in her name, although to gain that right she had first to undergo a technical eviction. \n This entailed a farcical dance in which a bailiff stepped in, removed a token stick of furniture and stepped out. She returned the furniture indoors and the house was then hers.  \"Even though I have everything - I have maintenance, I have custody - it can be done finally. It would be a once off.\"  \n The recent white paper on marital breakdown envisages a referendum to remove the ban on divorce. But while welcoming the paper, the divorce Action Group does not believe this will happen for another couple of years - beyond the life of this government - as the associated legislation dealing with joint ownership and pension rights must first be passed. \n This leaves judicial separation as the only option open to someone like Catherine. It 's equivalent, said Mags O'Brien, the DAG chair, to the  decree nisi  applying in the north:  \"The only thing that is lacking is the right to remarry.\"  \n As Catherine and her husband have been living apart, they would be granted a separation on the grounds of irretrievable breakdown, although she would be dependent on free legal aid to get it. So far this year, under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Act of 1989, 450 certificates for legal separations have been granted around the country - the waiting list is three to six months long. \n What irks Catherine, though, is that the husband not being Irish, can return to his country, divorce and remarry while she remains married to him in the republic.  \"He can do it - why can't I? ... I made a mistake, I chose the wrong person. I was in an abusive situation where I was abused mentally and physically. So why should I be punished by not being allowed a second chance?\"  \n There are only two ways of gaining such a reprieve - annulment or foreign divorce. Church annulments are pointless, according to Niall Courtney, secretary of DAG and a solicitor, as remarriage would be bigamy in the eyes of the state. About 20 state annulments are granted each year, on only three grounds: mistaken identity, impotence or non-consummation, or proof that either party had not intended to fulfil the marriage contract (if, for example, one of the parties was homosexual and had no intention of becoming involved in the heterosexual relationship). \n The republic, said Mr Courtney, had  \"the most advanced and most highly developed nullity laws throughout the western world, because we do not have divorce. So instead we have these very good jesuitical arguments and theories.\"  \n But procuring an annulment was expensive, he said, as psychiatric reports and tests were required and, if contested, if could cost <*> pound sign </*> 14,000 and take three to four years. Even if granted, it was not satisfactory if there were children involved, as they were rendered illegitimate when the marriage sank into the never-existed category. \n The alternative is to seek a foreign divorce - an English postal divorce, if uncontested, costs <*> pound sign </*> 60. Half of the DAG committee had done this, said Ms O'Brien. While foreign divorces have no legal standing in the republic if the domicile seeks the divorce, they are recognised by the Revenue Commissioners, who treat any second relationship on  de facto  terms for tax purposes. \n  \"From a legal point of view,\"  said Mr Courtney,  \"I do not see any point in doing it, but I can understand it from a human point of view.\"  There was finally a psychological end to the first marriage. \n The deputy leader of the Labour party, Ruairi Quinn, was divorced in the Dominican Republic - although he went only as far as Morales, an information agency on the North Circular Road in Dublin, to get it. Morales declined to comment as any contact it had had with the press had led to abusive anonymous phone calls. It cost Mr Quinn <*> pound sign </*> 850, but it allowed him to remarry in New York two years ago in front of some friends and family - although having to go to New York and sort out licences and residences had been, for both partners,  \"a pain in the ass\".  \n Not having his marriage recognised in the republic bothers Mr Quinn, and would certainly cause difficulties were he knocked down by \"the proverbial 46A bus\". Two widows would be competing for his 17-year D&/ail pension, which, he said, would be frozen until a civil court decided the issue:  \"There would be no contest - it would be wife one.\"  For his estate to be held by his second wife, it would have to be owned exclusively by her, which would entail legal costs and difficulties if she should die before him.\n Couples in second relationships still encounter problems, even where the house is jointly owned. Mr Quinn cited the example of a married couple in his Dublin constituency. One of the partners had the first marriage annulled by the Catholic Church, although not by the state. Now in a second marriage recognised by Canon law, they co-owned an <*> pound sign </*> 80,000 house. But, should one die, the other was only entitled to <*> pound sign </*> 10,800 tax free as he or she was  \"a person who is a stranger in blood\".  Mr Quinn said:  \"You end up paying <*> pound sign </*> 15,000 [corporation tax] simply to stay in your own house.\"  \n June Tighe was shocked into self-sufficiency when her husband almost died of a kidney disease. Living in a council house with two young children but without any qualification, she overnight felt vulnerable, insecure and dependent - not only on her husband, but, during his illness, on social welfare. At the age of 27, after nine years of being a home-maker, she went to college to study fashion design, returning home in the evenings to cook fish fingers and argue over what she was and was not allowed to do. \n  \"To cope with that,\"  she said,  \"you would have to be schizophrenic.\"  She left.  \"There was nobody else involved, he didn't drink, he didn't beat me up - it would have been easier if he did. We just had nothing more in common.\"  \n They organised an amicable legal separation, forgoing all succession rights, bestowing them instead upon their children. Even were divorce introduced, Ms Tighe would not remarry as she would not get involved again in the dividing up of property. \n Mary Reddy is buying off her council house. At first, the authorities concerned would not allow her to do so. But she convinced them she was better off without her husband, as she could control her <*> pound sign </*> 109 single parent 's allowance for her and her three children. \n Ms Reddy had had to put up with other women, alcohol, fractured ribs on Christmas day, a broken nose, scalded skin and near strangulation.  \"I seem to have had it every which way,\"  she said. A doctor 's letter and a barring order protected her for a year. Then she began to panic, thinking her husband would discover he was legally entitled to return - she could only renew her barring order were he to assault her again. \n Separated now for three years, she laughed at the concept of the white paper and all its theories:  \"It is not worth the paper it is written on unless you create a whole free legal aid system.\"  The paper says this will be done when public finances allow. \n Not being able to divorce bothered her. She felt it was important  \"on a personal basis to be legally yourself again\".  She had considered a judicial separation but felt it would cost too much in time or money.\n Even were foreign divorce an option, it would be futile, as  de facto  status was not recognised by social welfare. If a single mother begins a second relationship she loses all benefits and depends on her partner 's earnings - or, if he is on welfare, on his single allowance. \n Such situations, Ms O'Brien said, rendered null and void the argument by the former Fine Gael TD Alice Glenn that divorce would represent a cost to the state.  \"If people could marry again, they would no longer be claiming deserted wife 's allowance. They could regularise their situation,\"  she said.\n Meanwhile, Mary Reddy fills in the forms that give her the option of being single, married or widowed, even though most of the people she knows are separated - no longer able to tolerate the lives their grandmothers, mothers and aunts had.\n  \"My whole mess has evolved from a stupid decision to get married and have three children ... I 'd love to see that cardinal fella to tell him there are hundreds of people must like me who are not going to become nuns or zombies just because their husbands have left.\"", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c3676505-3a75-4456-bfcb-02da7dd09642", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.619760+00:00"}
{"text": "<Drugs - Child abuse>\n\n\n<$A>\n  Chasing the Dragon  \n  Heroin has once again exploded onto the streets of the capital. TS O'Rourke talks to one addict about his love of drugs and the problems of kicking the habit. We also report on a community that is fighting back and hear the opinions of    one   youngster who has already seen the    devastating   effects of drugs at age 13.  \n JOHNNY (an alias) is in his late twenties and has been a heroin user for over eleven years. His somewhat gaunt and menacing appearance is the result of some hard times. \n I met Johnny in a central Dublin pub, where we talked for an hour over a quiet pint. Explaining that he was just on his way up to Sean McDermott Street in order to buy some heroin, he said he would be back in a few minutes. He left, anxious yet smiling. \n Fifteen minutes later, Johnny returned having purchased two 'Q' (quarter-gram) bags of heroin from a young man on a bicycle, who was doing a roaring trade. Showing me the two little parcels of heroin, Johnny explained:  \"There 's loads of dealers in Sean McDermott Street, and if you know who to look for, you can get gear in a few minutes.\"  He then proceeded to go into the gents ' toilets, from where he emerged a little later, having smoked one of the two deals. The pub 's clientele were completely oblivious. \n This is nothing new to Johnny, who was first tempted to inject heroin by friends in Dolphin 's Barn. Less than a month later he was addicted, having used the drug on an almost-daily basis. \n He continues to use heroin because of what it does for him.  \"You get an amazing feeling of well-being, and you don't have any worries. Most other drugs have an uplifting effect - this is more of a mellow feeling. Everything feels great and you don't care about anything.\"  \n As you might have guessed, Johnny has paid for his addiction. Convicted four times, he has spent time in Dublin 's Mountjoy Prison.  \"I 've been convicted of robbery with violence and selling drugs to get money.\"  A heroin habit is extremely expensive, and Johnny got his money for drugs  \"basically by breaking into houses, stealing videos, robbing garages, mugging people and armed robbery.\"  \n  \"I didn't care where the money came from.\"  \n Speaking of his time spent in Mountjoy, he said:  \"Mountjoy is a dump - you wouldn't put a pig in the place. You 're only allowed out for six hours during the day - it 's not a nice place to be.\"  However, drugs are readily available, and Johnny admits that they help you to do your time. Apparently you can get anything you want in Mountjoy.  \"There are various ways of smuggling drugs into Mountjoy - the security there is very lax - and a lot of the screws turn a blind eye to it.\"  \n Despite widespread knowledge that the HIV virus can be transmitted through sharing syringes, addicts in Mountjoy continue to share their 'works' with one another, with up to 30 people using one syringe.  \"Mainly it 's injected by prisoners in the toilets or in the recreation area - you 'd see up to ten people in a cubicle using the one syringe. If you 're in the grips of a drug, you don't care what way it comes.\"  \n As prisoners are only subjected to a strip search - and not a cavity search - smuggling drugs in is not a problem. For many prisoners, repeated court appearances can be lucrative, as friends or relatives pass heroin packages to them, which they can either use or sell once they return to the prison. \n The best way to hide heroin is in your mouth, according to Johnny.  \"The Garda&/i can't force you to open your mouth - they can only search your clothes - so it 's easy. I 've been stopped a few times and searched by the police with heroin in my mouth.\"  \n The importation of heroin, although illegal, continues daily. Using couriers, the drug bosses import at least 20 to 30 ounces a week. Couriers are usually paid in drugs.  \"There 's great profit to be made - they bring in 60 per cent pure heroin, but by the time it gets onto the streets it 's only about 20 per cent pure.\"  Heroin is regularly cut with such innocuous substances as quinine or milk sugar, decreasing the purity and increasing the profit margin. \n Recently, users have taken to smoking the drug ( \"chasing the dragon\"  ) in an attempt to avoid contracting the HIV virus through intravenous use. \n According to many sources, the purity of the drug has almost doubled recently, and the price has also dropped. This, Johnny believes, is to lure back users by giving them a better hit while smoking it. Unfortunately, this has also led to an increased chance of accidental overdose for those unused to such pure heroin. \n As we were taking the accompanying photographs, a Garda sergeant walked right past, apparently oblivious to the presence of the drugs. Johnny said:  \"Most people would be very surprised at how easily available heroin is in Dublin.\"  Commenting on the success rate of the Garda&/i, Johnny said:  \"They are fighting a losing battle. They only seize about 2 per cent of the total amount imported, and there 's too much money involved for the drugs bosses to give it up.\"  \n Johnny is only one of over 5000 reported heroin addicts in Ireland. The Aruppe Society - who do work with homeless young people - estimates these addicts are responsible for over two-thirds of Ireland 's crime. \n\n\n<$A>\n Reclaiming the Community \n Meath Street, in the heart of Dublin 's south inner city, has long been depicted as a sort of urban 'badlands' where junkies and dealers congregate in large numbers and theft and violence are commonplace. \n Feargal Connolly, of the Meath Street-based Community Response project, is angered by the media 's negative stereotyping of the area.  \"Headlines like 'South Inner City Like the Bronx' are written by people who don't come from the area and who don't care. This sort of sensationalism doesn't do anything to help us improve our image, or deal with the drug problem.\"  \n The response group - one of many nationwide - was set up in 1990, towards the end of the 1980s drug epidemic. Once the epidemic had decreased in size and severity, there was no one organising against the big drug pushers. This void was filled by the Community Response, amongst others. \n The main function of the group, as Connolly describes it, is  \"to develop a response within the community around drugs, HIV, AIDS and drug-related crime.\"  This is achieved through work in prevention - with schools, youth groups and training workshops - and by educating children about the options which are open to them. \n In the wake of recent events around the city involving vigilante tenants evicting known drug pushers, the general consensus appears to be one of sympathy amongst the residents. Many people have seen whole families decimated by the scourge of drug abuse and, inevitably, AIDS. \n In the recent past, some residents have been holding meetings where accused pushers are given the chance to defend themselves before being told to leave the area. It 's a case of leave, or be forced to leave. Violence, however, is uncommon. With the dealers rather than the users targeted, Feargal states:  \"We are always very wary that people who have a problem are not targeted in that process.\"  \n Whatever way affected communities decide to deal with the big boys of the drug world, they can be sure of support from agencies and community groups, if not the politicians, who, in Feargal Connolly 's opinion, need to be  \"more accountable to the people\"  in the war against the big dealers. \n\n\n<$B>\n Fr Pat Buckley \n  What are we to do with Child Abusers?  \n MORE AND MORE cases of child sex abuse are emerging in Ireland. The Catholic Church is dizzy as it tries to come to terms with the various complaints against its priests. \n Some victims have now issued writs in Belfast. Cardinal Daly and Father Brendan    Smyth 's   abbot, Kevin Smith, have been cited as defendants. The Catholic Church in America has spent millions on legal settlements. The Irish Church is probably facing similar bills. But of course child sexual and physical abuse is by no means confined to priests and Christian Brothers: most of it takes place in families. \n Our primary sympathy must lie with the victims. Many of them have grown up physically, but they will always carry the scars of the abuse. Some of them will be condemned to living lives of great unhappiness as they mismanage relationships and find it impossible to trust. The victims deserve the very best counselling and more than adequate compensation. \n But what are we to do with 'perpetrators'? Some suggest that they should be castrated, others in anger would want to beat them up. A few would even suggest the death penalty. \n Child abuse is a very serious crime. Those who engage in it must expect to pay a very heavy price: society demands punishment and retribution. A severe prison sentence seems just, but we should never allow ourselves to forget that in civilised societies punishment should be linked to rehabilitation. \n In the United States they place great emphasis on sex offenders engaging in rehabilitation programmes. These are sometimes offered as an option to prison and the successful completion of a programme can lead to an early release. Sometimes the programme will involve re-introducing the abuser into the life of the abused. This can be the case particularly if the abused was a cherished family member. \n Very often it will emerge in therapy that the abusers themselves were victims of child abuse. It seems that some victims grow up to be perpetrators. This is especially sad, but it does show that child abuse happens sometimes as a result of human weakness and not badness. Of course this is no excuse, but it is an explanation. \n We need our medical experts and our psychologists to do an awful lot more work on the causes of abuse. And if it were to emerge that there was some genetic or compulsive psychological element, we would have an even greater responsibility to approach child abuse from the perspective of illness and treatment. \n Prison on its own is not the answer. Far too many abusers re-offend after being in prison. The Americans have proven that fewer re-offend after intensive therapy. \n There is a huge lack of programmes for abusers in Ireland. That 's a very great pity. One of the best ways to protect children in the future is to work with offenders so that they will not re-offend. Victims have their support groups and their rape crisis centres - I 'm glad that they have - but I wish groups for the abusers were common. \n Perhaps we sometimes forget that the abusers are human beings too. Many of them must have terrible problems to make them do the things they do. Abusers are somebody 's flesh and blood; they are somebody 's son or daughter. They were once innocent babies and children. Something happened to them somewhere along the line to put them on such a disastrous road. Those of us who profess Christianity have to remember also that God loves us all equally - no matter how low we sink. \n Child abuse is not a new phenomenon. It was always there, but it was hidden. It 's now coming out into the open. That means that we all have to face up to it. Our first responsibility is to the victims, but we also have a serious responsibility to care for the abusers. If the abusers cooperate, we should give them all the help they need. If they are not willing to take help, then perhaps there is a case for locking them away for a very long time, if only to protect the vulnerable.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "2fcefee9-d4c4-43aa-8e94-396df58bafdb", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.621178+00:00"}
{"text": "<Flats - Consent>\n\n\n<$A>\n<$B>\n The Flat Trap \n  Tens of thousands of people in Ireland are living in dangerous and unsanitary conditions, unaware of their rights or too afraid to exercise them \n Cormac O'Keeffe and Dearbhla Regan report.  \n In January 1994 two young men died in a fire at 110 North Circular Road, Dublin. The property had been converted into a multiple-occupancy residence prior to the implementation of the Landlord Act (1963). Dublin Corporation had no reason to inspect it, let alone know of its existence. The landlord had crammed sixteen bedsits into this three-storey house. The windows were barred and there was no fire escape. \n Following the tragedy Joe Costello TD (Labour) conducted a survey of the 166 houses on the North Circular, and found a  \"very serious deficiency in safety standards.\"  77 <*> per cent sign </*> had no alternative means of exit, in breach of the Fire Services Act (1981), which obliges landlords to take reasonable precautions against fire and ensure safety in the event of fire. \n Mr Costello was particularly critical of the performance of the local authorities and dismissed enforcement of legislation governing the private sector as  \"wholly inadequate.\"  Noel Carroll, Dublin Corporation PR Officer denies such claims.  \"Fire Prevention Officers are performing hundreds of inspections annually.\"  However, a maximum of thirty notices are being served every year. Moreover, the Corporation presently provides only 24 part-time Fire Prevention Officers and 27 part-time Health Officers to regulate the thousands of properties actually registered as privately rented accommodation in Dublin. \n Costello 's survey concluded that minimal policing of the private rented sector has led not only to a general situation of unacceptably substandard housing conditions, but to a uniform lack of awareness among the tenant population of their entitlement to basic health and safety standards. Acting Chief Environmental Health Officer Tom Carroll, however, denies the allegations.  \"Housing regulations are in the main being complied with.\"  He also rejects persistent Student Unions ' accusations that local authorities are not fulfilling their statutory obligations and that landlords, when found to be in breach of regulations, are not being fined. \n There is an even more fundamental inadequacy with existing legislation. The Corporation is only obliged to inspect registered properties and those converted after 1963. Mr Costello, however, stated,  \"I believe only a fraction of Dublin 's landlords are actually registered as such.\"  The law cannot be brought to bear upon the huge percentage of non tax-paying landlords who are renting out potential death-traps to students, single parents and the unemployed. \n  \"Totally unorganised and totally uncontrolled,\"  is Costello 's polite description of the free-for-all that is Dublin 's private sector.  \"The DoE must bring in statutory legislation obliging landlords to register with their local authorities,\"  he stated.  \"As it is, what happened at North Circular Road can and will happen again.\"  Without uniformly enforced registration, the introduction of The Housing Regulations Act (1993), which requires landlords to provide a rent book and maintain certain minimum standards of repair, is useless. \n Health and fire regulations are widely disregarded in Dublin. Fire escapes are not part of the city 's infrastructure. Burnt-out houses are. Hundreds of tenants are being cramped into dilapidated Georgian houses partitioned by plywood, despite a government warning that,  \"Three story buildings with large numbers of tenants are death-traps when they possess only the same number of fire exits they possessed prior to conversion to multi-unit occupancy.\"  In Drumcondra recently a young man jumped three stories from one of these houses to escape a fire. He broke both his legs. \n Such conditions are regarded as standard, rather than exceptional, among tenants renting privately in Dublin. We spoke to some of them at random about their experiences. \n David lives at the top of one of the multi-occupied Georgian houses in Leeson Street converted after 1963. To escape a fire he would have to jump four flights onto concrete, or a fire-engine could bull-doze through a garden wall to reach him. His landlord, who is registered, collects over <*> pound sign </*> 400 pw on one property alone. David called Fire Prevention to be informed that the landlord was only obliged to provide a smoke alarm or a fire extinguisher. A month later, David was given a fire extinguisher that wouldn't put out a cigarette. \n Most tenants we interviewed agreed that health regulations are also of minor concern to the majority of Dublin 's landlords. A certain wealthy and reputable landlady owns several houses in Lower Baggot Street. Deirdra, a potential tenant, went to view some of her flats recently. \n Legally, there must be at least two doors separating a bathroom from a kitchen. In at least two of these flats the toilet is actually in the kitchen, which is itself attached to the living room. 'Toilet' is a generous word. These port-a-loos don't even reach the ceiling, and the shower is in there as well. The landlady is charging <*> pound sign </*> 43 pw per person. From mid-September she will have hundreds of students queuing outside her doors. \n Students in Dublin are particularly vulnerable to exploitation. The vast majority of them are living in dangerously substandard accommodation. They provide a constant demand for housing, but as a transient body are also virtually powerless to demand tenant rights. With Dublin 's chronic scarcity of habitable accommodation, students are an ideal market for unscrupulous landlords seeking to make a quick turn-over profit, because they can always be relied upon to grab substandard flats at ludicrously inflated prices. \n  \"Competing for accommodation in a situation of excess demand, students cannot afford to be assertive. Very few even know they have rights,\"  according to UCD 's Welfare Officer, Stephanie Leahy. Ms Mary Higgins, manager of Threshold in Dublin, said,  \"The problem is fear. With no security of tenure, young people are afraid that if they complain they will be evicted. They probably would be.\"  She reported a further significant increase in the number of illegal evictions passed last year. Tom Carroll, also admitted that tenants were unwilling to co-operate with inspections for fear of provoking the landlord. \n This state of affairs applies across the board and in Northern Ireland as well. In towns facing explosive increases in the student population, such as Athlone, even minimal attempts to provide campus housing and remove students from exploitation have met with vehement opposition from private landlords.  \"Students here are still looking for somewhere half-decent to live at the end of March,\"  according to USI News Editor at Sligo University, Catherine Kearney. Meanwhile, twenty-three students were forced to share a house separated from each other by plywood walls. \n  \"The unregulated private sector is an unacceptable and glaring area of abuse,\"  Costello concluded. While he welcomes recent reforms, he is  \"extremely suspicious\"  that the governmental will to introduce obligatory registration actually exists, despite the support voiced in favour of it by Mr. Emmett Stagg, Minister for Housing. \n At the August launch of their Challenges and Change report, Threshold were also extremely critical of the  \"unevenness\"  in the implementation of The Housing Regulations Act   . Like Mr Costello, Ms Higgins was particularly critical of the local authorities, which she described as  \"moribund and underfunded.\"  She does not believe that new regulations will do anything to mitigate the situation as long as the lack of policing that has characterised the system to date continues. \n  \"In housing matters generally, there should be someone looking to the public good,\"  Higgins stated. As it is, the wolf is at the door in the guise of a laissez-faire policy regarding the behaviour of opportunistic and corrupt landlords. \n Deaths such as those on the North Circular Road are not accidental. They are preventable by the statutory installation of cheap and simple fire provisions. The government, even more so than the landlord, must be called to account for turning a blind eye to the exploitation of low-income groups. To date, the government has been succumbing to the implicit threat that if regulations were rigidly enforced, landlords would sell out and send this state-dependent body of tenants out of their hovels and onto the streets. \n\n\n<$C>\n matthew 's column \n   \"The Age of Consent is being used to show society 's disapproval of our love\"   \n The Age of Consent is there to protect our youth. Fair enough, in theory, but with reported cases of abuse rising, and the true levels unknown, certainly higher and probably terrifyingly so, it 's obviously not a strong enough defence for our minors. There 's no point in having consent laws without comprehensive education in schools to inform those whom the laws are meant to protect how those laws work, and what rights they give. Many of those who are abused as children would not have undergone as much pain, terror and misery, had they been taught at school what sex is and what abuse is, and how that law is there to protect them, no matter what the abuser is saying or doing to threaten and terrify them into silence. \n Of course the guardians of youth and morality in our society are completely opposed to compulsory and comprehensive sex education in our schools. The idea of celibate nuns or monks teaching about love, safe sex and emotion in convents and religious schools is rather ridiculous. \n In Britain the Age of Consent is unpopular amongst homosexuals because it enshrines anti-gay discrimination in law. The majority of Conservative and Labour MPs seem to believe that men between the ages of sixteen and eighteen are more susceptible to the approaches of men than women of the same age, despite the advice of the British Medical Association and many other experts. Beyond that, it shows Parliament 's willingness to reject the pretence of the concept of equality in British law and allow the continuation of discrimination. It 's natural that gay men and women should be annoyed at this - the Age of Consent over there is being used to show society 's disapproval of our love, not to protect 'vulnerable' young men of seventeen. \n How do the honourable elected members decide on suitable ages of majority anyway? The homosexual Age of Consent debate ignored expert advice on the best way to protect men between sixteen and eighteen, and to facilitate the distribution of safe-sex information to vulnerable gay men of that age. Instead they did what pleased their intolerant constituents and the tabloid press. In Ireland there is no common age of majority - marriage with one 's parents ' consent and cigarettes are available at sixteen, driving licenses and extra-marital sex at seventeen, and alcohol at eighteen. The law here seems confused at just when one becomes an adult - not because one is more ready for cigarettes at 16 than extra-marital sex, but because these laws are the results of political horse-trading and attempts to please special interest groups like drink and tobacco manufacturers, the medical profession, the church and homosexual and lesbian lobbying groups, and all the rest. \n In a recent British survey, a link between sex education and higher ages of first experience and lower teenage pregnancies was shown, and this has been reaffirmed by countless other surveys. Holland has the lowest Age of Consent in western Europe, yet with comprehensive sex-education, the average age of first sexual experience is higher than in the UK, and teenage pregnancies are lower. Common sense says that giving our youths responsibility and education is the best way to protect them, and cotton-wool and ignorance are dangerous. We need comprehensive and compulsory sex education to protect our youth, and a common age of majority, now. \nMatthew Wherry", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "06c498db-0355-4e60-8d6a-4d18b08d8f6c", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.622091+00:00"}
{"text": "<PD formation>\n\n\n<$A>\n  7 - A New Party  \n On the night Des O'Malley was expelled from Fianna F&/ail a leading Fine Gael activist, Michael McDowell, was at home looking at television. Watching the event unfold on the news McDowell commented to his wife that if the former minister started a new political party he was sure to get a fair degree of support because the time was right for it. McDowell 's wife, Niamh, said that if her husband felt that way he should make his views known to O'Malley. So he sat down and wrote a letter encouraging O'Malley to form a new political party and offering whatever help he could give. \n Michael McDowell was an up-and-coming young barrister who at this stage was growing increasingly disillusioned with Fine Gael 's role in government. He had served three years as chairman of the party 's organisation in Garret FitzGerald 's constituency of Dublin South East and had made no secret of his view that the coalition with Labour was a disaster. \n To the deep irritation of FitzGerald, McDowell had used the occasion of his last speech as chairman, at the constituency annual general meeting a year before, to make his view that the party was going nowhere and he told his surprised fellow party members that he had decided never to vote for Fine Gael again if what they were offering to the electorate was a coalition with the Labour Party. In the Law Library he regularly discussed politics with Michael O'Leary, the former Labour leader who was now a Fine Gael TD. O'Leary had performed the remarkable feat of getting elected as a Fine Gael TD only weeks after quitting as Labour leader because of a humiliating rejection of his policies at Labour 's annual conference. It did not take long, however, for disillusionment with his new party to set in and O'Leary was highly critical of the way the Fine Gael-Labour government operated. In McDowell 's house shortly before Christmas 1984 the two men drew up a list of the seats Fine Gael would lose at the next election. They arrived at the grand total of twenty-one (when the election came over two years later it was nineteen) and concluded that there was no way of stopping a Fianna F&/ail landslide. \n It was not long after that - in February 1985 - that McDowell wrote to Des O'Malley. He got no immediate response, but after Easter he was contacted by Fianna F&/ail TD Mary Harney, who had been a close ally of O'Malley in Fianna F&/ail and who also knew McDowell through student debates a decade earlier. She asked him if he was serious about joining a new party and he said he was. Subsequently McDowell invited O'Malley around to his house for dinner and the two men met for the first time. \n In the meantime Fianna F&/ail friends of O'Malley were also considering the option of a new political party. Seamus Brennan, the former Fianna F&/ail General Secretary who had been an anti Haughey TD since 1981, Mary Harney and David Andrews were chief among them. An opinion poll was organised by Brennan and financed by Barra O Tuama, the Cork hotel owner and concert promoter, and published on 18 April. The poll showed that 39 percent of people asked were in favour of a new political party headed by O'Malley while 35 percent were against it. An interesting feature of the poll which was carried out by Irish Marketing Surveys was that the most positive reaction came from the middle class voters and large farmers. The strongest support was located in Munster, not surprisingly in view of O'Malley 's home base and the sympathy for Jack Lynch. \n There were mixed opinions at the time on the significance of the poll. Haughey dismissed it as irrelevant, but for those planning the new party it appeared hopeful, particularly as it was published only a few days after another poll which showed a big drop in Fianna F&/ail support due to the O'Malley expulsion. \n In the following months, though, the steam seemed to go out of the plan. At the beginning of the summer Seamus Brennan began to go lukewarm on the project and appeared more interested in pursuing his political career within Fianna F&/ail. O'Malley 's supporters in Limerick were also reluctant to get involved, most of them preferring their TD to stay on as a sort of independent Fianna F&/ail deputy who might one day be reconciled with the party. \n Mary Harney was still a strong advocate of a new party. She went to the United States for the summer and when she returned she found that while planning for the party was still continuing it was beginning to flag. Brennan had dropped out, but another Fianna F&/ail TD, Charlie McCreevy, who had been a Haughey supporter in 1979 but had quickly become a die-hard opponent of the Fianna F&/ail leader, had become involved. Another to join in McDowell 's scheme was Paul McKay, who had been treasurer of the Fianna F&/ail organisation in Haughey 's constituency but had resigned in protest at the way the accounts were kept. He undertook a feasibility study on the launching of a new organisation. O'Malley, however, still remained very reluctant to commit himself to a new party. \n A crucial meeting of the conspirators took place in Michael O'Leary 's house in Wellington Road in September. At the meeting, besides O'Leary, were O'Malley, Harney, McDowell, McKay and McCreevy. At this stage O'Malley had gone very cold on the idea and told the others that they should do nothing for the present at least. Showing his impatience at the delay and indecision, McCreevy told the others that if the new party did not go ahead that night he was out and would have nothing more to do with it. O'Malley was a bit wary of McCreevy because of the way he had put down the motion of no confidence in Haughey in October 1982 without consulting anybody, and he was unwilling to respond to such an ultimatum from him. \n A crucial factor in the indecision was the way in which the three attempts to remove Haughey had been botched. \n  \"I think there was a lack of trust among some of us about the reliability of the others because of the way the heaves against Haughey had gone. At this stage each regarded the other as wimps because of what had happened before,\"  said one of the plotters later. Some strongly anti Haughey TDs in Fianna F&/ail, like Bobby Molloy and Pearse Wyse, had had a stomachfull of conspiracies and were not involved in any way at this stage. A serious car crash in November, which could have killed O'Malley, gave him a severe shock and that put back discussion yet again. \n While they waited to see if a new party would get off the ground McDowell and O'Leary drafted a divorce Bill. O'Leary introduced the Bill in the D&/ail but only five TDs supported it. However, it added to the pressure on the Fine Gael-Labour coalition which was theoretically committed to holding a referendum on divorce. Shortly afterwards the Anglo-Irish Agreement, signed by Garret FitzGerald and Margaret Thatcher on 15 November 1985, was denounced in the strongest terms by Haughey. The Fianna F&/ail leader had earlier dispatched Brian Lenihan to the United States to lobby leading politicians against the planned Agreement. This attempt to sabotage an Anglo-Irish accord infuriated Irish-American politicians, particularly the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Tip O'Neill, and did nothing to enhance Haughey 's reputation. \n When the Agreement was announced the old divisions in Fianna F&/ail were exposed once again. The Agreement was welcomed by O'Malley and former Taoiseach Jack Lynch and on 20 November Mary Harney issued a statement in favour, saying she would vote for it. She followed this up by going through the government lobby along with O'Malley. Expelled from the party a week later she now joined O'Malley as an independent and continued to encourage him to form a new party. Harney 's strong advocacy of a new party and Fianna F&/ail 's utterly negative attitude towards the Anglo-Irish Agreement rekindled O'Malley 's enthusiasm and he now committed himself fully to the project. \n At a meeting in Paul McKay 's house in late November the decision was finally taken to launch the party. McKay and McDowell leased premises at South Frederick Street. A discussion paper was prepared on the aims of the new party, to be called the Progressive Democrats. RTE reporter and former young Fianna F&/ail star Pat Cox had joined the planning at this stage and his advice counted for a lot with O'Malley. Rumours began to circulate in political circles by mid-December that something was up and the newspapers carried speculation that O'Malley was about to establish a new party. \n The Progressive Democrats were finally launched on 21 December 1985. To begin with the party had just two TDs, O'Malley and Harney. In acknowledgement of his work in establishing the party McDowell was appointed chairman, which emphasised that the PDs were not simply a Fianna F&/ail dissident rump. Michael O'Leary had been willing to join but O'Malley thought this might give the impression that the PDs were simply a refuge for people who couldn't find a home elsewhere. So despite the fact that he had been in on the planning of the new party there was no room for him in it. It was a decision that the founders of the PDs were later to regret, not just on a personal level but because O'Leary, whatever his political inconsistencies, was a marvellous vote-getter and a potential seat was thrown away. \n Gemma Hussey records in her Cabinet diaries how the involvement of McDowell came as a blow to Fine Gael.  \"Dessie O'Malley 's new party, the Progressive Democrats, was announced today. Michael McDowell is the chairman. Will it hurt Fianna F&/ail more than us? It is depressing that Michael did this; it must be hurtful to Garret.\"  \n Four days before Christmas seemed an odd time to launch a political party but the timing actually worked to great advantage. The PDs dominated the headlines and news bulletins and O'Malley sounded very confident as he went on radio asking for donations of <*> pound sign </*> 150,000 a year to make the PDs a viable prospect. In the early days of the new year the party took off. Advertisements were placed in the papers on 2 January seeking money and supporters, and the party headquarters were inundated with people wanting to get involved. By 6 January over four thousand people had enrolled as members and <*> pound sign </*> 25,000 was contributed by public subscription. Over a thousand people attended the first party constituency meeting in the Marine Hotel in Sutton and the major parties began to sit up and take notice. \n Haughey went on radio a few days later and expressed the view that the PDs were not acting in the national interest, but the crowds continued to flock to their public meetings. At these early meetings O'Malley hammered home the core message of the party - that the state was strangling the economy through an involvement matched only by the communist countries of Eastern Europe. He committed the PDs to cutting taxes as the essential first step in putting the economy right. To an electorate crippled with personal taxation, disillusioned with a stagnant economy and rising unemployment, the new party 's message sounded attractive. O'Malley 's imposing presence and Mary Harney 's abilities as a speaker contributed to the air of excitement generated at those meetings. \n It was a very unsettling time for Fianna F&/ail. A significant number of activists in constituencies like Dun Laoghaire, Dublin South and the Cork City constituencies began to desert to the PDs. The question was whether the deputies for those areas, some of whom had been close to O'Malley, would follow suit. There was a wide expectation in both Fianna F&/ail and the PDs that Dun Laoghaire TD David Andrews would switch parties and there were rumours about Seamus Brennan from the neighbouring constituency. Brennan, however, set his face completely against joining and in fact spent a lot of time trying to persuade wavering Fianna F&/ail deputies to stay in the party. In the middle of January when rumours developed that Cork TD Pearse Wyse was on the verge of leaving to join the PDs, Brennan and Bobby Molloy were dispatched by Haughey to try and get him to stay on.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "83908dbe-cf6c-4750-9c5c-94c91c200088", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.622988+00:00"}
{"text": "<Poverty>\n\n\n<$A>\n Many Dublin streets are named after the trades and workers who set up their homes here more than 1,000 years ago. Consider Tailors Hall, the Linenhall or Weavers Square. Records still exist - 900 years later - of the butchers who sold meat from the Fleshambles. The potter who worked his wheel over 700 years ago is still remembered in Crocker Street as is the tanner in Skinners Row or the smith in Copper Alley. \n Seventeen years ago, employment was the norm and not the exception in Kilmount. Almost every family had a working head of household. Suburban trains and buses ferried workers to jobs along the North Wall or Inner City. Many were men who worked in the construction industry, car assembly plants or the small engineering firms that flourished in the early 1970s. Other traditional sources of employment were the haulage and cargo firms along the dockside. Then there were jobs in firms such as Kosangas, Gouldings, Smith and Pearsons, Noyeks or Wigoders. Most of these have closed. Reasons for these job losses are many and the following are just general examples. \n The oil embargo of the mid-70s and the resultant recession and spiralling inflation, started the slump still experienced by the Kilmount workforce. Short-time and lay offs became commonplace and workers lost jobs, many never to work again. Imports coupled with changes in production methods caused job losses in the car assembly industry. Changes in technology meant that many skills became obsolete. The printing trade suffered particularly as did the associated industries. Many dockers were made redundant as goods were increasingly shipped by container. \n Recession in the construction industry during the early 1970s and 1980s meant many of the men in Kilmount lost their jobs and have never been employed since. Cutbacks in State services in the 1980s led to more job losses. Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council stopped providing essential repairs to local authority houses and flats. Workers were then laid off. \n  Kilmount  \n Some families have succeeded in making the transition from work to unemployment. Their story is one of struggle and huge personal cost. For others, it has resulted in marital breakdown, children leaving home or being put into care. Many women end up relying on tranquillisers in order to cope \"when they have nowhere to turn to anymore\". \n The head of household was employed in just 38 (48 <*> per cent sign </*>) of the households in our survey, while 42 (52 <*> per cent sign </*>) were in receipt of welfare payments. Of these, 22 (26 <*> per cent sign </*>), all male, were receiving unemployment payments. Three of these were in receipt of Unemployment Benefit and the remaining 19 received Unemployment Assistance. The period of unemployment ranged from as little as eight weeks to 15 years. Four of the 22 had been employed as skilled workers in their last jobs (chef, roofer, tiler, painter). Three others had been in semi-skilled work, such as driver or storeman, while the remaining 17 had all been all unskilled workers such as cleaners, labourers and yardmen. \n Along with those who are unemployed, there are also ten female heads of households who are lone parents and in receipt of social welfare payments. Since the Social Welfare Code perceives these women as having family responsibilities and thus being unavailable for work, they are excluded from registering as officially unemployed. They are, consequently, also excluded from government-funded training and employment schemes. Also, many married women who gave up their work when they got married are now anxious to return to the workforce. It is difficult for married women or women with children to re-enter the workforce. In addition to the shortage of jobs, a serious lack of creche and childcare facilities prevent women from having access to work. \n It is clear that few families in Kilmount have access to secure well paid jobs. Most would form part of the unskilled workforce but are excluded from the workforce altogether. Many are forced into long-term unemployment. The people of Kilmount, for the most part, live in relationships of economic and social dependence. Class inequality in Ireland has become more pronounced over the last 20 years. It seems that present economic arrangements are creating a permanent unemployed class with deepening economic divisions in our society. \n  Case Study 4 : Anne and Noel  \n Anne and Noel moved to Kilmount in 1973. Before the move they lived in a three-bedroom flat in Ballymun. They had four children at the time and Anne was expecting her fifth. She became pregnant to qualify for a Corporation house. Noel was working as a builders ' labourer, work was plentiful and Noel could pick and choose from a variety of jobs. \n Anne and Noel were delighted when they were allocated a house by Dublin Corporation.  \"We joked all the way home about being property owners\".  The couple knew that living in a house would be more expensive. Rent would be higher and they would have to buy coal and pay for hot water, unlike the flat in Ballymun where central heating and running hot water were included in the rent. However, they were hopeful about the future. They liked Kilmount and the children quickly settled into their new schools. \n The couple were saving for a planned kitchen extension when the  \"world came tumbling down around our ears\".  Noel had been working for a sub contractor, who in turn was working for a building firm. The building firm developed financial difficulties and was unable to pay the subcontractor. Noel 's firm folded and his boss left the country owing thousands of pounds. \n Noel had trouble tracing his cards and other records which led to difficulties with dole and pay-related benefits. They lived on Supplementary Welfare Allowance for three months while this was being sorted out. But the allowance was insufficient and they  \"slowly slipped into debt\".  Noel continued to look for work but had no luck because of the decline in the construction industry. He has had very little work in the last nine years. \n Anne explains:  \"Things have been very bad these last few years. He doesn't look for work any more. He got very depressed when they told him he was too old for work - can you imagine the effect that has on a many his age? He was 43 at the time\".  \n Noel worked in the black economy for a short while, as a security guard for <*> pound sign </*> 1.50 an hour, two or three nights per week. The experience unnerved him because he was afraid that someone would report him to the authorities and the family would lose their social welfare payments. Anne was relieved when he  \"jacked the job in, the wages were only slave labour anyway, and he wouldn't have a leg to stand on if he was attacked on the job\".  \n The family is in deep debt now. Being on welfare over a long period of time has meant they have been forced to borrow money from a loan man to pay rent arrears to stave off eviction proceedings. They have also borrowed from a loan company to pay for school expenses for four remaining school children. Their eldest boy has finished second level school and is now looking for work. \n Anne feels depressed about the way they live now and her depression is made worse because there is never any money to pay for house repairs and decorations.  \"The house is in rag order and I can do nothing about it, no matter how hard I work it never looks any better\".  \n Anne and Noel have been looking at ways to try and resolve their difficulties. One possibility is for Noel and the eldest boy to travel to England. They plan to work on a building site and rent a flat together. They will travel home on alternate weekends throughout the year. Commuting like this is one way of easing the misery for the family who all hate the idea of Noel going. \n Anne concluded:  \"None of us are happy about the family breaking up but it 's happening anyway because of the strain. Anything is better than this poverty, hiding from the loan man when I don't have his money and always dreading strange knocks at the door. England might just give the young lad a chance, he's very talented and can do anything with his hands. Noel plans to come home for good as soon as our bills are straightened out. Maybe by that time things will have improved on the job front at home\".  \n  Low Paid Work  \n For many people the only alternative to unemployment is low-paid work. Semi-skilled or unskilled workers usually receive lower pay than their skilled counterparts and tend to have little security in their jobs. They are more likely to be laid off when work is slack and these interruptions can affect pension rights or any chance of saving. Families on low pay often have a lifestyle that is little different to those who are unemployed and living in poverty. \n Working conditions are often harsh. The work, often shift work is menial and repetitive. Low-income workers are ineligible for Supplementary Welfare Allowance payments to help with large household bills, regardless of any crisis or exceptional need that might occur. They are not usually granted a medical card, unless they have an ongoing or serious illness. They are often unable to avail of help with school books and exam fees, because most schools need 'proof' of poverty. Yet even low-paid insecure workers have certain advantages over those who are unemployed. \n They are gainfully occupied, they have dignity and a sense of their self worth. Society recognises the value of work. Work is not just about money but also about making a contribution. Workers have a social life outside of family and community. The workless seldom venture outside the area unless it 's for rituals connected with social welfare payments. Workers may have entitlements and benefits connected to the job such as a pension fund, savings club, sports and leisure activities or even annual social outings that are work related. Involvement in trade unions allows the members to obtain organising and administrative skills. \n  Case Study 5: Tom and Vera  \n Tom and Vera have six children. The eldest child has emigrated to London in search of work. The second eldest left school early, and is now unemployed and waiting to do a FAS course. The remaining four children are still at school. Until recently the family lived on Unemployment Assistance, coupled with Supplementary Welfare payments for fuel allowance, shoe grants and help with ESB bills. \n Vera told us of their lifestyle 17 years ago. They moved to Kilmount when the area was \"brand new\". They had three children at the time. Tom had a secure job in plant maintenance with a firm on the North Wall. The firm pulled out of Ireland during the oil crisis. Tom received a redundancy payment which kept the family going for a couple of years. \n After two years of applying for jobs Tom stopped looking for work altogether. According to Vera:  \"He became moody and depressed. He stopped talking to us. The whole family was affected by his moods\".  \n Tom panicked when he reached the age of 50. He had been unemployed for nine years and was afraid that he would never work again. Unknown to his wife or family Tom accepted a job as a cleaner. The job paid less money than his social welfare payments and made him ineligible for Supplementary Welfare Allowances. He made a decision to accept a job for little pay because he was anxious to return to the workforce. Tom later explained to his family that he  \"had packed in the dole because he had to get out of the house before he went mad\".  Tom believed that it was easier to get a job if one already had a job. Particularly so for someone of maturing age such as himself. His new wages (after tax and social insurance) worked out at a few pounds less than unemployment assistance. He was more than willing to \"pay this price for his dignity\".  \n Vera wasn't sure if the price was worth it. The family now had less money, no welfare benefits and they had also lost their medical card for a while. It was re-issued later due to exceptional health problems. Neither Vera nor Tom were aware of the Family Income Supplement for those working for a low income. During the interview we told    them   about FIS and they have since applied for it.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "3885deab-d37b-4a8c-a384-c56cfe41e48a", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.623965+00:00"}
{"text": "<Zoo - Environment>\n\n\n<$A>\n Who 's New \n by Mark Challis, Assistant Zoo Manager \n One ring-tailed lemur and two black and white ruffed lemurs have been born, both rare species from Madagascar. The ruffed lemurs caused much confusion as we were unsure which of the three females was the mother, as all three were presumed to be pregnant, and all three appeared to be caring for the infants! After some careful observation (and a little guesswork) it would appear that 'Mandy' is the proud mum. \n Also among the primates, there has been a birth in the Colombian spider monkey group (the second this year), one Goeldi 's monkey and two golden-headed lion tamarins. All these species are endangered in the wild, particularly the golden-headed, whose wild population is in the low hundreds. We are currently the only zoo in the UK breeding this handsome and critically endangered species. \n The breeding female Weddell 's tamarin gave birth to twins, which will grow up in their large family group, in our off-show breeding accommodation, the group being part of an ongoing behavioural research project at the zoo. \n Two mara have also been born, as have a litter of meerkats, though it will be some time before they are old enough to leave their underground den and be seen out in the enclosure. \n Among the hoofstock, one blackbuck and one red lechwe have been born, as has an attractive zebra, born to the mare 'Amo', which is now out in the large paddock shared with the giraffe and the ostrich. \n The birds have similarly benefited from the onset of summer, and we have already had successful hatchings from bare-eyed cockatoos and red-crested pochard, while a number of other species have recently laid eggs. \n The rare domestic breed we keep have also been productive, with the births of two Dexter cattle, five Ronaldsay sheep, fourteen Tamworth pigs, nine Berkshire pigs and eight hybrid pigs, the result of a meeting between a Tamworth boar and a Berkshire sow. \n There have been a number of exciting new arrivals including ten species of waterfowl that are now on the lake, and several new species of birds for the new Bird Park, including satyr and Tamminck 's tragopans, Palawan peacock pheasants, pink pigeons and Bali mynahs. Parrots have also been moved into the new aviaries and Asian short-clawed otters have arrived for the new exhibit opposite the sea lions. \n A trio of fat-tailed dwarf lemurs arrived on breeding loan from Bristol Zoo. Infrequently kept in European collections they are rather shy though very attractive, should you see them in their enclosure in the Nocturnal House. \n Perhaps most exciting of all, the old Hyena Enclosure now has four African wild dogs in residence. Severely threatened in the wild, extinction for this species has been forecast, within the next 20 years. Now part of a European Breeding Programme (EEP), the African wild dog has proved a difficult animal to maintain longterm in captivity. Our four brothers on loan from Amsterdam Zoo, will shortly be joined by a single female from another European Zoo. \n\n\n<$A>\n BIRTH OF BABY GORILLA \n Belfast Zoo proudly announces the birth of Djamba, a male gorilla, born to Delilah aged 32. \n This is only the second successful gorilla birth in Ireland, and the first to be reared by its mother. The previous gorilla, born at Dublin Zoo, was hand-reared. \n Allowing a baby gorilla to be mother-reared carries potential risks because the reaction of the other gorillas in the social group can be unpredictable, as can be the ability of the mother to cope with her offspring. \n Delilah was brought to Belfast Zoo from across the water when her mate died, having already successfully reared seven offspring. Although relatively ancient at 32, the move has provided her with a new mate and also gives the other young Belfast gorilla females an opportunity to observe the rearing process, thereby strengthening their own chances of breeding successfully. \n\n\n<$A>\n BELFAST ZOO CHIMPS DEVELOP NEW TECHNIQUE IN TERMITE FISHING \n One of the finishing touches to    Belfast   Zoo 's million pound award-winning Primate Enclosure built in 1991 to house some of its star attractions, a colony of chimps and a family of gorillas, was an artificially created termite mound. \n Situated in the Chimpanzee House, the termite mound is designed to provide intellectual stimulation for the chimps and is similar to those found in the wild, with one exception; as termites are fairly difficult to come by, the zoo has substituted different types of jam. The idea is that the chimps dip sticks into the holds in the mound to reach the jam at the other end. \n Recently, however, primate keeper, Alyn Cairns has noticed that the clever chimps have devised a more effective method of jam fishing. They have discovered that chewing on the ends of the sticks to make them more brush-like and absorbent means that they can scoop up more jam! \n\n\n<$B>\n Seeing Sense by Kathleen Mannis Zoo Education Officer \n Sight is the sense which we use most of all and our eyes are very highly developed with only birds able to see better than we do. For many animals sight is not important and they therefore have only very simple eyes which can detect light/darkness and movement. \n To form a clear image a lens is needed to focus. Most vertebrates (animals with a backbone) have this type of eye. Birds have the best sight of all, birds of prey having remarkable vision. \n Not every animal can see in colour as we do. Dogs cannot distinguish red from green and most nocturnal animals have very poor colour vision. Once again birds are the best and can see many more hues than we can. Some animals can see wave-lengths that are invisible to us. Piranha fish and goldfish can see infra-red used in remote control beams, while most insects can see ultra-violet. \n\n\n<$C>\n \"The Environment - A Sustainable Future\" Billy McAlister, architect, town planner and environmental assessor \n  Ulster Tatler has for some time been aware that environmental issues are playing an ever-increasing part in our lifestyle. We have asked Billy McAlister, Architect, Town Planner and Environmental    Assessor   to edit a series to ensure that Ulster Tatler makes a necessary contribution to the environment initiative. \n Everyone 's talking about it, most people know something about it and a few people are very concerned about it - THE ENVIRONMENT.  \n WHY, all of a sudden, are we being subjected to a massive media promotion of matters relating to our past, present and future living standards, highlighted by disasters causing irreparable damage to our world resources? Every day there is some reference to degradation and destruction at global, national and local levels. Have values changed and living habits altered to an extent out of all proportion with patterns of earlier long established standards? The answer is that the situation has been slowly creeping up on us and at an increasing rate over the past 50 years. \n A SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT boils down to maintaining a balance between the use of the world 's resources and the number of human beings using them. Tribes, in earlier times, and in some parts of the developing world today, maintained this balance by controlling their population directly related to the availability of resources, such as food, and, materials for clothing, shelter, and weapons. If the balance was or is not maintained the small community either had to split and move away, or as has happened, in many cases disappeared. The situation can also be applied to a certain degree affecting much larger communities and even nations and dynasties looking back through history. Maintaining a state of balance is best likened to a see-saw on which two equal sized children can maintain a simple equilibrium. Once, however, one child, through over-eating, weighs heavier than the other, the resultant state of imbalance creates difficulties for each of them. \n ACCENTUATING the difficulties in maintaining this status quo is another aspect, that of CHANGE, an inevitable dimension brought about by \"man 's\" natural ability and motivation for invention and innovation. Since the advancements brought about by the Industrial Revolution, which were also reflected in commerce and agriculture, CHANGES have been increasing in rapidity, in complexity and scale. In transport terms alone, the movement from the horse-and-carriage to the super-sonic jet-propelled aeroplane and the \"off-the-shelf\" 100 m.p.h. motor car, has been achieved in less than 100 years! However, these new forms of transport require fuel, and so followed the exploitation of oil which has gone along apace over this period. The same scenario applies to food production, and the over-demand of a dynamic increase in world population necessitating the introduction of special innovations in framing practices and animal breeding and husbandry. \n ALTHOUGH \"warning bells\" were set ringing after the last war indicating that continued \"progress\" (for want of a better word) of this nature and magnitude could lead to problems of scarcity of natural resources, little notice was taken, even though the effects of the consequences which might ensue were known and well publicised. It was not until events took place which had considerable impact on human beings and their desired lifestyle, did the \"person in the street\" become aware that there was a threat to their own personal well-being. We, who are old enough, can well remember the London Smog after the last war over a period of three weeks, when an estimated 50,000 deaths were attributed to breathing the over-polluted air, the Abervan slag-heap slippage, when no regulation of this type of waste product was in place, the first oil tanker spillage of the Torre Cannon, the Bhopal Chemical Factory emission in India when 3,000 died and the effects are still being felt, as with the Chernobyl nuclear fall-out. The Exxon Valdes oil tanker spillage in Alaska has been followed by one nearer home recently in Shetland, and oil fires pollution from the Kuwait oil fields shocked us all at the time. Closer to home we have the continued controversy of Selafield effects making us realise the gravity of the earlier near disaster fall-out at Three-Mile Island in the U.S.A.; even nearer home, the Du Pont accidental chemical emission into the Foyle, which probably got little or no international coverage, which makes one wonder if these sort of events are a daily  <-> occurrence   occurrence   on a world scale. \n SOME major events which affect many square miles of territory bring conflict between neighbouring nations, with Scandinavian countries pointing the finger at Britain for the effects of acid rain on their land and forests, or, on a much greater scale, the U.S.A. and Europe accrediting changes in weather and climate to the massive scale of the destruction of the South American rain forests. \n Led by initiatives in the United States dating back to the early 1970s and the recent dedication of the European Community to effect environmental policies attempting to ensure a sustainable environmental future, considerable compliance requirements are now in place and these are supported by the appropriate legislation to effect severe penalties (fines up to <*> pound sign </*> 10 million) on the \"polluter\" and making avoidance of duty of care relevant to the high risk of legal action. \n As this series progresses, the author hopes to examine the issues which form the make-up of our environment, such as flora, fauna, climate, traffic and human beings and their cultural and economic needs, etc. relating these to the constructive viewpoints that a sustainable future can be achieved providing we all have a sense of awareness and a will to create and then maintain a worthwhile world for generations to follow. \n  Only 40 years ago we saw our planet from space for the first time. We saw it as a small unsuspended ball in space, comprising, not, as we think of it as people, of buildings and highways, but of soils, water, vegetation and clouds and it is these we must preserve.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d67622ad-c88a-46ae-9e3e-5c858914aa12", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.625100+00:00"}
{"text": "<Health - Environment>\n\n\n<$A>\n The Fat We Eat \n by Cherril Bremmer \n  It has been estimated that in the UK our present fat intake represents about 42 <*> per cent sign </*> of our total energy intake, and is around 140g daily for an average adult. \n Fat is necessary in the diet for the following reasons: 1. Fat represents the most concentrated form of energy available supplying about 9.3 kcals per gram. Carbohydrate and protein provide about 4.1 kcals per gram. 2. It imparts palatability to food and lubricates it so making eating and swallowing much easier. 3. Dietary fat is necessary for the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. These normally occur associated with fat. If the diet was fat-free, absorption of these vitamins would be poor, even if they were taken as supplements. They will not be absorbed across the intestine wall unless they can travel with fat. If it is absolutely necessary to take supplements of fat-soluble vitamins (namely A, D, E and K), these are best taken with a meal, rather than on an empty stomach, so that fat will be available for their absorption. 4. All fats contain Fatty Acids, three of which are essential in the diet. This is because they cannot be synthesised in the body, so must be provided. To ensure an adequate intake of these essential fatty acids it is necessary to eat a variety of foods containing fat.  \n The amount of essential fatty acids required represents only around 5 <*> per cent sign </*> of our total energy intake, and apart from a supply of fat-soluble vitamins, this is in theory, all we need. However, nature does not supply all the essential fatty acids or fat-soluble vitamins, in the required amounts, in any one food, so we need a variety of fats. \n In Western society we generally consume excess fat for the principal reason that it makes our food more palatable, but the difficulty now facing us, is how to find an acceptable compromise between what is good for our health and what we have come to enjoy. \n We must strike a balance between using enough fat to provide for our needs while suiting our tastes but without harming our bodies by over-indulgence. \n Whilst the total fat in our food is important, of equal importance is the nature of that fat, which brings us to consider saturated, polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats. The difference between these three types of fats is based on the chemical structure of the fatty acids they contain. All fats are composed of fatty acids in association with glycerol, but differences between them occur in the fatty acid fraction. \n A fatty acid is composed mainly of Carbon, and Hydrogen, with a small amount of Oxygen. The carbon atoms form a chain linked together by chemical bonds. \n In SATURATED fatty acids, each carbon is linked to the next by ONE bond and this renders the entire structure chemically stable. \n In MONOUNSATURATED fatty acids, two of the carbon atoms in the chain are linked together by TWO bonds - called in chemistry a DOUBLE BOND. Since there is ONE double bond, the fatty acid is said to be MONO-unsaturated. This double bond renders the entire structure less stable than the saturated form, and more vulnerable to attack by other chemicals. \n POLYUNSATURATED fatty acids have TWO or more double bonds in the carbon chain, so are even less stable and that much more vulnerable to attack. \n In terms of the food we eat, these facts are significant for three reasons: 1. The vulnerability of the carbon chain of mono and poly unsaturated fatty acids makes them more susceptible to attack by digestive enzymes. That means they are more easily broken down in the body. 2. The double bond makes the unsaturated molecule more flexible so it is more easily carried in the human transport system. 3. Vulnerability inside the body, also applies externally so unsaturated fatty acids are more easily oxidised by atmospheric oxygen, a process which produces unwanted fat peroxides. For this reason an antioxidant must be added to fats containing unsaturated fatty acids to lengthen their shelf life. \n It has been observed that a diet high in polyunsaturated fatty acids results in a lowering of blood cholesterol - the principal enemy of the heart and arteries. \n Cholesterol is produced internally by the liver and is also present in many foods we eat. While it is advisable to reduce cholesterol intake, such a reduction does not necessarily result in a lowering of blood cholesterol. Studies have shown that the diet of Mediterranean people who use Olive oil, appears to be less harmful in terms of Coronary Heart Disease than the Northern European diet containing more saturated fats. Olive oil contains the monounsaturated fatty acid, Oleic Acid, which is thought to have certain advantages over polyunsaturated fatty acids. \n The Government recommends that we reduce our total fat intake to between 30 <*> per cent sign </*> and 35 <*> per cent sign </*> of our total energy intake, and that fat 15 <*> per cent sign </*> or less should be derived from saturated fats. \n To accurately assess your present fat intake in relation to total energy intake is tedious and time consuming, but you can estimate this by noting the fat in grams, you consume each day. Most food labels now contain information on the fat content and if you add up the fat per portion and find it to be more than 80 grams per day (for a woman of normal weight) or 100 grams per day (for a man of normal weight), then you must reduce it. \n If you aim for 70-80 grams per day of which 10-12 grams are from saturated fats, for a woman and 90-100 grams per day for men, of which 13-15 grams are from saturated fats that will bring you within recommended intakes. \n When it comes to the beloved Ulster Fry:- 1. Grill bacon and sausage. 2. Use olive oil or polyunsaturated vegetable oil for frying. 3. Measure the amount of oil you use in a tablespoon, counting 11 grams for each. 4. Keep a note of how much oil you use and try to reduce this to a minimum. 5. Remember the advice of the Bible - to be moderate in all things - make it a monthly treat! \n\n\n<$B>\n RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS Jacqui Armstrong \n  Rheumatoid    Arthritis   affects between two and three per cent of the population, with three quarters of the sufferers female. It is a chronic, usually progressive, inflammatory disease of the joints. It usually attacks several joints and in some cases the onset is quite rapid and severe, but more often it develops over several months or even years.  \n The symptoms    vary   from person to person. These range from stiffness in the morning, painful and swollen joints, fatigues, to poor appetite and weight loss. \n The inflammation is caused by a reaction between the white blood cells and various chemicals produced by the body. The white blood cells invade the joint and release certain enzymes which secrete chemicals that cause the breakdown of cartilage and bone. \n Medical experts are not sure what causes this chain of events to occur. Some scientists believe rheumatoid arthritis is caused by a virus which causes infection in the arthritic joint. The virus triggers the inflammatory process, but so far it has not been possible to identify the virus responsible for this. \n Other researchers believe it is a malfunction in the body 's immune system. The immune system normally produces antibodies which destroy bacteria and viruses. In the case of rheumatoid arthritis is could be that these antibodies turn against healthy tissue in the body. This is called an \"auto-immune response\". But if there is no bacteria in the joint, why does the immune system \"attack\"? \n One theory is that inflammation and destruction in the rheumatoid joint triggers the production of heat shock proteins or stress proteins. The stress proteins are found in all cells and are essential for survival. It is only when they are subjected to ultra violet light, chemicals, heat etc. that they are produced in large quantities to protect the cells. Some experts believe that the immune system may not be able to distinguish between bacterial or viral protein and one of the body 's own proteins, because they both have a similar amino acid structure. \n Other causes of rheumatoid arthritis may be connected to free radical activity. These are unstable chemicals that are made by the body and if they reach high levels they may cause many health problems, including the inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis. \n Food intolerance may also be involved in this condition. This has not been proved conclusively, but we know that certain foods can make joint pains worse, possibly due to increased acid levels in the blood. \n As we can see there are many complex theories as to how this condition is caused but is there anything that we can do to help the problem? \n One of the things we need to look at is our diet. We have already discussed some of this in part one of this article. This should include plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables cooked and raw, salads, cottage cheese, brown rice, natural yoghurt and use honey as a sweetener. \n Foods to avoid are red meat, pork, ham, white sugar, oranges, lemons, grapefruit, tomatoes, vinegar and too many dairy products. These foods contain a lot of acid which causes an imbalance in the blood which is predominantly alkaline. When the acid levels in the body become too high it can make the inflammation much worse. \n In addition to a balanced diet there are food supplements available that can be of help. Some of these are evening primrose oil, fish oil capsules, vitamin E and vitamin C. \n Vitamin C is a marvellous, natural    anti-inflammatory   and 1-2 grams a day is recommended. An excellent supplement to combat free radical activity is the \"Fish Factory\". This contains fish oil, beta    carotenes  , vitamin C and E. \n Along with these supplements we can use some homeopathic preparations. One of these is \"Nettidiath\" an excellent blood purifier containing acid levels and improves the immune system. \n \"Urex tablets\" can also be of benefit as these have been known to relieve pain and stiffness in the joints. \n By following these simple measures much can be done to assist the body to overcome the miseries of rheumatism and    arthritis   \n\n\n<$C>\n  DREAMING OF A GREEN CHRISTMAS  \n  Be kind to planet earth and save on festive resources  \n  INSTEAD of dreaming of a white Christmas this year, why not think about the environment and do your bit to create a green one? \n In the run-up to Christmas last year sale of food in December increased 16pc on the rest of the year, sales of non-food goods by over 40pc. \n More goods means more packaging and more waste. On top of this many manufacturers garnish their products with extra festive packing in order to tempt the season 's shopper. \n  Scrooge  \n Environmental groups stress that thinking green is easy. It doesn't mean turning to a Scrooge or losing out on the fun. \n Break traditional family rituals and think of imaginative ways of saving resources. Finding new and more careful ways of indulging can be fun.\n Their message is to think before you buy that over-packaged gimmicky gift, pick the usual spruce for the front room or switch on the fairy lights. \n Roger Mortlock of UK 2000, a national environmental group linked with the Department of the Environment, believes people might not automatically think of the environment at Christmas, yet it is an ideal time to do so. \n  \"Christmas seems a really good opportunity to start thinking about the environment because most people divide their waste automatically. \n \"All the paper and packaging ends up together and provides an easy opportunity to take it for recycling.\"  \n UK 2000 has launched Action Earth, a seasonal campaign to get people to think of the environment this Christmas. \n As well as producing a Green Guide to Christmas containing a range of ideas to make the festivities more environmentally friendly but no less fun, it is urging people across the country to volunteer for one of a range of green activities. \n John Barwise, head of environmental policy at The Robens Institute Surrey University, stresses the onus is on the individual. \n  \"Christmas is a time of mass conspicuous consumption. Clearly there will be a need for people to consume more than they usually do, but whatever we can do to minimise the amount of materials we use the better it will be for the environment.\"  \n Message \n As a first step, shoppers could look carefully at the way goods are presented and, when producing over-packaged goods, to ask the retailer to remove unnecessary layers of wrapping in the shop. \n This, he says, will send a clear message back to the manufacturer. \n  \"That message,\"  he says,  \"has got to come from the consumer.\"  \n For copies of the Action Earth Green Guide to Christmas write to UK 2000, PO Box 2000, London N1 9NJ. \n Friends of the Earth, 26-28 Underwood Street, London N1 7JQ.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ac15dfa6-8bb9-4446-8bea-5d422523f926", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.626071+00:00"}
{"text": "<Biology matters>\n\n\n<$A>\n CHOLESTEROL \n  We hear a lot of talk these days about cholesterol but do we really know what it is and what it does to us? If we asked the average person \"what is cholesterol?\" we may get the following responses. It 's something in fatty foods...it 's something to do with heart diseases...it 's bad for you, isn't it? ...and so on. So now let us look at what it is and the role it plays in our bodies. \n Cholesterol is a naturally occurring fat-like substance and at room temperature appears white and waxy. Cholesterol is not quite the rogue it is made out to be, it also plays an important role in the function of the body.  \n Much of cholesterol is a vital constituent of cell membranes, the nervous system, vitamin D, some hormones and bile salts. However, it also occurs in the more simple form of circulating fat particles in the blood-stream. It is when these fatty particles become excessive, cholesterol can start to build up on the artery walls. \n Cholesterol is manufactured by the liver and carried around the body within particles called lipo-proteins. There are two types of lipo-proteins, LDL (low-density lipo-proteins) and HDL (high density lipo-proteins). LDL transports cholesterol from the liver to the peripheral tissues, including the artery walls. At this stage it can contribute to the furring up process in the arteries which can eventually lead to coronary heart disease. The other type HDL, transports cholesterol from the    tissues   back to the liver and helps prevent the furring up process. Therefore a raised HDL level is good as it can give some protection against heart disease. \n Approximately one gram of cholesterol is made in the liver and small intestines each day. Even if we take no dietary cholesterol, animal fats and small amounts of   vegetables   vegetable   fats our bodies continue to produce cholesterol. However, if we consume a diet high in cholesterol and saturated fats, i.e. eggs, dairy produce, meat, processed vegetable fat and take very little exercise, we run the risk of higher levels of cholesterol in the blood. \n Cholesterol is measured by taking a blood sample. The amount is measured in millimoles per litre. In the United Kingdom the average reading of cholesterol is between 5-7.5mmol/L. This is higher than it should be with the ideal being 5mmol/L or lower. Anyone with a raised cholesterol level should try and reduce this. \n One of the first things that is necessary is a change of diet. We should avoid the following:  Fatty meats (lamb, pork). Skins of animals (sausages, salamis and pates). Cream, full fat milk, butter, full fat cheese, pastries, fried foods, etc.  \n We need to switch to low fat alternatives and try to use oils such as olive oil, peanut, groundnut oil and rape seed oil. These oils are rich in mono-unsaturated fatty acids which helps raise HDL levels. Sunflower oil can also be used as a substitute for saturated fat in cooking. It is important when using polyunsaturate spreads instead of butter that it is not spread half an inch thick on our bread. \n We should increase the amount of fibre in our diet, especially soluble fibre which helps deal with cholesterol. Soluble fibre is found in fresh fruit, vegetables, legume vegetables, i.e., peas and beans and dried legumes such as lentils, chick peas, soya beans, red kidney beans, etc. Oatbran is another rich source of soluble fibre. Also we should eat more fish such as mackerel, herring and salmon. \n Regular exercise is important as it can help lower LDL cholesterol levels and raise HDL cholesterol levels. \n Also supplements such as garlic capsules, fish oil supplements and vitamin B3 are helpful in lowering cholesterol. \n Therefore, by adopting better eating habits, exercising more we will feel better and also help reduce a major risk factor of heart disease. \n\n\n<$B>\n Producing quality young vegetable plants \n VEGETABLE PLANTS grown in glasshouses or polytunnels have increased in popularity since their introduction here in the early 1980s. \n The transplants raised in module trays offer an alternative to bare-root and block-raised plants for field vegetable production. \n The division of the trays into cells means each plant is a separate unit requiring its own water and feed supply with no buffering reservoir available from its neighbour. \n  BENEFITS:  The main purpose of raising vegetable plants in modules is to produce crops which are uniform and to achieve continuity of market outlets. \n In addition, the speed and ease of planting is enhanced by using a module transplanter. \n Module plants will also have a small reservoir of water and nutrients on which they survive during the first few days in the field before new roots establish in the soil. \n The cost of seed has risen. For example, hybrid cauliflower seed has doubled in price over the last five years. \n The use of modules makes better use of high cost seed as better germination is achieved under protection than if sowing the same seed in an outdoor seedbed. \n The module trays are usually made of rigid polythene or plastic. After being filled with a module compost they can be seeded using a plate or vacuum seeder. \n  VEGETABLE CROPS:  Modules are used for a range of crops, but especially for brassicas (cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts and calabrese) and for early leeks. \n The size of the module cell varies depending on the plant to be grown and time of sowing. Autumn-sown crops are sown in larger modules as they will not be planted out until the spring, whereas a spring-sown plant will only take about six weeks to produce a plant ready for transplanting. \n The larger module will help to extend the season by producing an earlier crop than those sown in a smaller module - for example, a 308 tray. The most common tray used for main crop production contains either 260 or 308 cells. \n  MANAGEMENT:  In the glasshouse of polytunnel, the module trays are raised off the ground to allow air movement under them. This air helps to prune the young roots, keeping them within the cell. \n The growth of the plant can then be controlled by the liquid feeding. In a late season when ground conditions are too wet for planting, the young plants can be 'held' by regulating the feeding. Then, prior to planting, they are fed with a higher nitrogen feed to stimulate growth again. \n  PLANTING:  The date of planting has a larger effect on the crop maturity date than the date of seed sowing. This is important when a grower requires continuity of production from crops such as cauliflower and calabrese. Modules are ideal for ease of planting of small areas at regular intervals. \n  PROPAGATORS:  There are specialist plant propagators who produce plants to order as required by their customers. However, it is also possible to grow modules on-farm provided the management of the young plants in modules is very good. \n  DEVELOPMENTS:  The design of trays is changing to allow more plants per unit area of glasshouse and also to be more durable. \n In the field, starter solutions applied at planting are now being used to enhance the development of new roots immediately after planting. \n\n\n<$C>\n Coliform mastitis a major killer \n THE BOVINE mortality survey carried out by the Veterinary Science Division identified coliform mastitis, or acute environmental mastitis, as one of the major killers of adult dairy and suckler cows in Northern Ireland. \n Unlike ordinary mastitis, the udder infection in the coliform version has been shown to be the result of exposure to bacteria that survive and, in the right conditions, multiply within the cow 's environment. \n It is most common during the winter months when cattle are housed, particularly from December to March, and often in milking herds which practice teat dipping and dry cow therapy. \n The affect herds are usually well-managed, the husbandry is good and the cows are mainly housed in cubicles and fed silage. \n  SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:  \n Typically, the condition occurs in freshly-calved cows in their fourth or fifth lactation. It is uncommon in calved heifers. \n The bacteria involved are mostly the same as those excreted in cow faeces and  E. coli  are the most commonly isolated species - hence the general term coliform mastitis. Because these bacteria produce toxins, the affected animal is often suddenly very ill, after being quite normal at the last milking or feeding time. \n The cow will be very depressed, sometimes down and unable to rise with a low body temperature - this can be confused with milk fever. There will be swelling    of   one    or   more of the mammary quarters with a watery mastitis. \n The overall survival rate is usually only 50 per cent and urgent attention will be required from a veterinary surgeon who will use aggressive therapy, often including intravenous fluids, to save the life of the cow. \n Quarter sampling, for culture and drug sensitivity at a laboratory, will indicate the best form of antibiotic treatment for use in future cases. \n Recent evidence also suggests that stripping out of the infected quarter, every two or three hours, to remove the  E. coli  and its toxin, is a helpful procedure. Ironically, the infected quarter, although lost to the present lactation, will return to almost full production in the next lactation, provided the cow survives. \n  CONTROL MEASURES  \n  Calving boxes:  Obviously, it is important to reduce the level of faecal contamination in the cow 's immediate environment. \n Because freshly-calved cows have a depressed immune system, they are known to be more susceptible to coliform mastitis. \n Consequently, it is essential to clean out calving boxes at regular intervals, certainly at least two-three times during the winter months and particularly after a coliform mastitis has occurred, as this indicates that the environment is heavily contaminated with  E. coli  \n  Cubicles:  It is equally important to keep the    ?   of the cow 's environment as clean as possible. \n Scrape out the backs of cubicles and passageways at least twice a day and bed down the cubicles at lease three times a week with sufficient material to make the cows use them. \n Unfortunately, the bacteria can multiply in dirty, damp bedding, particularly if it is the type of material that could act as a compost, for example, materials such as sawdust, mushroom compost, chopped paper and peat. These will require more attention than biologically inactive materials such as crushed limestone, sand and rubber mats. \n However, all of these are useless if they are contaminated and are continually damp because the ventilation within the cubicle house is inadequate. Dry bedding in a well-ventilated house with slotted roofs and Yorkshire cladding will inhibit the multiplication of  E. coli.  \n  Before and after milking:  In the parlour, make sure that the cow 's teats are cleaned and dried before milking. \n Drying is particularly important, as    washing   without it just produces a heavily contaminated drip at the end of each teat. \n Also, make sure that the milking machine is cleaned adequately after each milking with a temperature that exceeds 85Deg C to ensure the destruction of coliform bacteria. \n High Total Bacterial Counts (TBCs) are a sure sign that one, or all, of these tasks are not being done properly. \n Finally, infection can also take place immediately after milking, particularly when the teat canal is still open and the cow leaves the parlour to lie in a dirty cubicle. \n Closure of this canal takes 20-30 minutes and if the cow can be kept on her feet for this period, say at the silo face because she is hungry, then disease incidence will fall. \n Reducing the concentrate levels in the parlour and closing the cows out of the silo for one-two hours before milking will have the desired effect. \n  CONCLUSIONS:  \n 1. Coliform mastitis is caused by faecal organisms. \n 2. The condition is life-threatening, so seek immediate veterinary help. \n 3. Control measures should be aimed at reducing the environmental levels of  E. coli.  \n 4. Keep cows on their feet after milking.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6e1294e0-4e2b-4e0a-9547-7ddb67ff9b13", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.627089+00:00"}
{"text": "<Bulimia - Nutrition>\n\n\n<$A>\n Battle of the binge Mandy McAuley \n BULIMIA NERVOSA \n  It will affect one in eight females. It can cause internal rupturing, infertility and tooth decay. Bulimia Nervosa may not be as visual as anorexia, but it 's equally destructive.  Mandy McAuley  talks to Rebecca, survivor of the battle of the binge.  \n BULIMIA NERVOSA will affect one in eight females at some stage in their early adult life. Trapped in a self-destructive cycle of uncontrolled bingeing, forced vomiting, and laxative abuse more women are opting to deal with their emotional insecurities behind closed doors. Unlike anorexia nervosa, which triggers a range of highly visual and immediate    side-effects  , bulimia nervosa remains a secretly tolerated disorder. It is notoriously difficult to detect in its initial stages, and many sufferers receive no form of treatment until serious physical and    psychological   damage has occurred. To date medical research has linked prolonged binge-vomiting with internal rupturing, tooth decay, heart attacks, epileptic fits, infertility and severe mood swings. \n     Rebecca 's   Story \n Rebecca is a 35 year old design specialist. Now in the recovery stages of the illness her impeccable appearance and confident manner belie a 15 year on-off battle against bulimia. A self-confessed perfectionist, her low, husky voice lends the only clue to years of self-induced vomiting:  \"It happened when I was 20. Up until then I was always on yo-yo diets but I was never anorexic. As far back as my early teens I regarded food as a primary source of comfort. One evening I was baby-sitting for college friends and I became so frustrated and depressed that I yearned to eat everything they had set out for me plus any food left in the cupboards. At that stage the overwhelming fear of obesity was the only factor holding me back. Suddenly the magic idea of being sick came to me and that 's exactly what I did. It was a very painful and tearful experience but within the space of two years I was managing to make myself sick up to 12 times a day.\"  \n Unable to cope with emotions of any kind Rebecca freely admits convenient transition:  \"It was a vicious circle. The more emotions I felt the more I ate to cover them up. I used the food to anaesthetise myself - it gradually helped me to opt out of life and living. I was thankful that I had stumbled upon a convenient escape route from the pressures of a fledgling career and stormy personal relationships.  \n  \"The actual disposal of the food made me feel good because I could exercise some degree of control over my life without getting fat. That initial high inevitable plunged to depression when I thought of the amount of money, food, and sheer energy that I had wasted.\" \n  Food for thought  \n As her illness took on obsessive proportions Rebecca 's life revolved around food - where to get it, what to eat next, and how to get rid of the evidence:  \"I was literally eating and throwing up. Occasionally I would get up in the middle of the night to be sick. When my stomach threatened to seize up I dosed myself with laxatives or stuck things down my throat until the rawness and swelling became unbearable. Keeping the illness from those around me was the hardest part. Rather than arouse suspicion by disappearing to the toilet after meals I resorted to vomiting into a bucket and bin-bags which I kept locked in my private study. I usually disposed of the evidence around the garden hedges or poured it outside the drains when no-one else was at home. At one stage I rarely ventured into friends ' bathrooms without a spray deodorant in my bag and elastic bands to tie back my hair. Fear of discovery kept me away from local grocery outlets. I travelled miles each day purchasing fresh supplies of food.\"  \n  Denial  \n As personal relationships and a promising career crumbled under the strain Rebecca clung to food as her last source of comfort:  \"Desperation merely fuelled the illness although I convinced myself that I was still in control of the habit. By now family and friends feared that I was hooked on drugs. Alarmed by my secretive behaviour and sudden mood-swings their genuine concern sparked a vehement, almost vicious, denial of the illness.\"  After more than two years of persistent self-abuse Rebecca was forcibly admitted to hospital where she underwent months of intensive treatment. Angry that she had been compelled to seek help she continued to deny that she had a serious psychological problem:  \"In the early '80s hospitals were dealing mainly with anorexics. I was put in a bed beside anorexics which suited all of us since I was more than willing to eat into their limited food quota at every opportunity. Some of the nurses wondered why I had been admitted as a long-term patient. They never got to see my crazy behaviour or destructive mood-swings simply because I was not allowed access to large amounts of food. Although the standard of treatment is higher and more varied today, at that time it tended to focus on the bulimic 's physical condition rather than their long-term mental well-being. Desperate to return to my comforting world of binge-vomiting I quickly perfected the art of acting normal. Looking back I don't think that anyone could have helped me at that stage since I had not yet accepted that I had a problem. Ultimately all forms of treatment are doomed to failure if the sufferer lacks the sheer will to confront the illness and get better.\"  \n  Ability to deceive  \n On her release from hospital Rebecca 's physical condition had dramatically improved. Her determination to binge-vomit was stronger than ever:  \"I knew that it wasn't normal behaviour but I didn't even try to stop. Humiliated that the more disgusting aspects of my disease had been so ruthlessly exposed I resolved to cover    my   tracks with more elaborate ploys and lies. \n  \"Most of my family didn't know how to react to the revelation. Although my parents were deeply shocked and upset the illness was simply beyond their realm of understanding. People tended to adopt a cautious approach. They never referred to bulimia in conversation but I was painfully aware of them watching me and I didn't like it. Weeks after my release from hospital my brother found a bucket of sick in my study. I was sorry that the discovery affected him so badly. He was nothing but repulsed.\"  The bewildered reaction of Rebecca 's family and friends stemmed from their inability to cope with the self-destructive nature of the illness. By refusing to accept or even acknowledge offers of help she fuelled their feelings of inadequacy and despair. Alarmed by the intensity of her mood-swings, few could begin to understand why this attractive and intelligent young woman was so intent on committing a slow form of suicide. \n  Stress related  \n Like many of her fellow sufferers, Rebecca had been a conscientious and ambitious teenager. Her illness baffled those who had singled her out an early age as a potential high-achiever. Today Rebecca attributes the failure to take control of her life to over-protective parents and an oppressive education system. While both demanded outstanding results, neither encouraged self-motivation:  \"Part of my problem was growing up in an environment where I was never allowed to think for myself rather than pursue my own goals. I resorted to people-pleasing at an early age. Eager to impress parents and tutors but incapable of taking decisions I sought advice from hundreds of people about the choices I should make at various stages in my career. Inevitably I ended up more frustrated and depressed. I tortured myself for being half-pretty and half-talented. Terrified of failure I developed a complex that I did not have. \n  Sick of being sick  \n Rebecca was not ready or willing to get better until 19 when she reluctantly contacted Overeaters Anonymous (OA), a self-help fellowship which caters for overeating and bulimia. There she finally learned to think and feel for herself.  \"By 1988 I was literally sick of being sick, of the hiding and deceit. After years of half-heartedly doing the rounds of doctors, psychiatrists, self-help groups, and treatment programmes I actually began to think about getting better.\n \"OA encouraged me to recover at my own pace. I was never bullied into contributing to group therapy sessions. You can sit there for a year without even introducing yourself. Simply listening to others talking about their experiences of the illness relieves the loneliness and a great deal of pressure. Six months passed before I was ready to open up and really explore my emotions. It was a terrifying experience but I had tremendous support from people who were like me and knew exactly what I was thinking. There was a great sense of solidarity and guaranteed anonymity. Eventually I began to realise that I could think and feel without food.\"  \n  One day at a time  \n Rebecca continues to attend OA on a regular basis. <#>\n Rebecca continues to attend OA on a regular basis. Since 1988 her bouts of binge-vomiting have grown sporadic. Although she remains convinced that there is no absolute cure for the illness she is now dealing with her bulimic tendencies on a day-to-day basis.  \"Fighting bulimia has been an up-hill struggle I will always feel nervous and slightly vulnerable around food. Bulimia is like gambling or alcoholism. It 's a turning to something else because you can't cope with the basic demands of living.  \"Although I do sometimes resort to binge-vomiting it 's mostly stress-related. I no longer use food to hide from my feelings. Over the last five years I 've discovered an inner strength which has helped me to rebuild my career and make    amends   for the pain inflicted on those closest to me. \n\n\n<$B>\n Animal nutritionist 's role \n THE ROLE of an animal nutritionist is varied and, therefore, difficult to define, writes Dr David Bruce (pictured right), senior nutritionist, Devenish. \n We often find ourselves as the key link between the suppliers of agricultural products and the famer as the end user - quite often in the firing line! \n An animal nutritionist has to be capable of giving advice on a multitude of different areas. He must be multi-skilled in order to carry out his role correctly. \n Agriculture is continually changing, new research work is being carried out, new products are being developed, legislation is changing, farming techniques are changing. \n It is extremely important that the nutritionist is aware of all changes and keeps abreast of them if he is to give meaningful, relevant and up-to-date advice. \n Nutritional input is necessary in numerous areas of animal production, right from the purchase, use and control of raw materials in animal and mineral feedstuffs, to the feeding of these products on-farm. \n There can often exist a huge variability in the quality of raw materials used in the manufacture of animal feedstuffs and in the quality of forages conserved on the farm. This has been clearly demonstrated during this present winter with poorer quality silage. \n The requirement for different feed formulations, feeding and management guidelines are, therefore, necessary. The nutritionist plays a key role in designing diets to suit different situations, taking into account the varied genetic potentials of animals, the different environmental and management conditions on individual farms, in order to enable farmers to produce his end product as cost-effectively as possible. \n The nutritionist can often find himself working closely with the farmer 's veterinary surgeon, helping in the control, prevention and cure of nutritionally related problems which can occur on farms. \n Management practices have changed considerably over the years; farming in general has become much more intensive. In my opinion, farmers are now required to be much more efficient; farming must be treated like any other business - those who want to survive need to have a good knowledge of the business they run. \n Intensification brings its own problems. Animals are continually being bred for increased production and more and more is demanded from them. If the management and nutritional inputs are now correct, these animals will not be able to cope with the stress they are put under. \n The consumer is demanding more from the marketplace and this means that the farmer is increasingly having to produce exactly what the consumer and market requires. \n Farmers are an important link in the production chain and it is extremely important, with the help of the animal nutritionist, they do everything they can to satisfy these demands. \n The establishment of various farm quality assurance schemes are certainly a step in the right direction. With a high proportion of our farm produce being exported, it is important that we maintain our high standard of hygiene, health and production in order to maintain and increase our market share. \n Ever increasing legislation on the control and use of medicines and other products puts increasing pressure on the farmer as well as the nutritionist. \n Antibiotics, performance enhancers are necessary for efficient production and are commonly used, but require proper use and control. Observing correct withdrawal periods and the correct use of these products is extremely important. \n Unfortunately, the agricultural industry in recent years has been the subject of various foods scares, salmonella, BSE, clenbuterol, etc. It is of paramount importance that our agricultural produce is seen to be of high quality, wholesome, disease-free, residue-free, in order to maintain customer confidence and safeguard our livelihoods. \n In recent years, the welfare and environment aspects of farming have become more of a talking point.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "51a78ec5-d969-486f-bc81-b95826ebdcb7", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.627966+00:00"}
{"text": "<Christmas - Animal health>\n\n\n<$A>\n  SELF HELP  \n By Dr. Ruth Elliott \n Did you know that to some people, Christmas is a source of great stress? What a shame! It can be a very exciting time with plenty of activity, an atmosphere of hustle and bustle with people in a happy and elevated mood. \n There is a saying,  'People are upset, not by things, but the view they take of them.'  In other words we can choose how we wish to react to anything in life. When we think about Christmas we can choose to regard it as a fabulous time of the year, with an air of activity, a feeling of anticipation of something about to happen and a general feeling of well being. \n On the other hand, we can choose to regard Christmas in a number of negative ways. I do not really like to be suggestive of any of the possible negative interpretations, but I feel it is important to recognise at least a few. For example, it is possible to become overwhelmed by the problems of Christmas shopping, sending Christmas Cards, planning Christmas outings and entertainment and sorting out family obligations and regard these in a negative manner. However we can choose instead to concentrate on the more positive aspects of these and other Christmas activities. \n Christmas is traditionally regarded as a period of peace and goodwill. It is unfortunate that for a number of us, we have neglected this aspect and allowed ourselves to be carried along by various outside pressures. \n For instance, take Christmas shopping as an example. I have often heard people say they hate Christmas shopping. I 'm sure you have heard this on many occasions. Now how would feel if you thought that the Christmas gift you had just received caused the giver such distress? \n Would you really appreciate it? To reverse the situation, do you really want to give someone a gift if it has caused such hassle or pressure? \n I can understand that for some people the fuss of crowded shops and the indecision as to what to buy for certain friends and associates can be unpleasant. However we can alter this and regard it in a more positive manner. If we decide to enjoy our Christmas shopping, find pleasure in selecting the most appropriate gift and give it in a gesture of friendship, we ourselves will gain so much more pleasure and enjoy a sense of achievement and elation. \n When we decide to go shopping at Christmas, it is important to have our plans made before we start. If we make a list of names of all the people to whom we wish to give gifts, then add in some possible gifts for some, it means that at least some of the decisions are already taken. Hence we are not in the position of wandering around aimlessly. Gradually we will also be able to think of appropriate gifts for the remaining people on our list. \n The same applies to Christmas cards. Again may I remind you that none of us would wish to receive a card from someone who had not enjoyed sending it or who did not mean the message on the card. \n Another aspect that often makes people shudder when they think of Christmas is that so much needs to be done at the one time. We tend to leave things to the last minute, then get into a fuss. Most of us have a tendency to procrastinate at any time. More so at Christmas. The difference between Christmas and other times is that for once the deadline cannot be extended. Knowing this, one wonders is this rush at the end partly due to laziness or do we tend to keep putting things off until we ourselves are victims of the fuss we claim to dislike. \n Housewives often regard Christmas as being very stressful because of the cooking involved. Some dread making the traditional Christmas dinner for months ahead. But is it such a big deal? It 's no more really than a Sunday lunch and at least you do not have to rush it - no-one is going far on Christmas Day. Furthermore we should not forget the joys of cooking and the sense of satisfaction one achieves from presenting the ultimate meal. Unfortunately, like so many other aspects of Christmas, the original joys have become masked in our modern-day emphasis on actual achievement without regard for the sense of well-being that accompanies the expression of quality. \n Another aspect of the Christmas season is entertaining. Many people have work outings with their colleagues. Often restaurants are fully booked at this time. Sometimes standards are not as high as usual. People who do not eat out often find this upsetting and complain. This has the unfortunate effect of spoiling the lunch/evening for others in the party. \n Those who eat out frequently throughout the year accept a lesser standard - they understand that staff have problems and concentrate on enjoying themselves and not getting upset. Indeed does it have to be spot on so long as all are enjoying themselves. The important point is being together and experiencing the atmosphere which is so infectious. I always feel at this time of year, it is a pity to entertain at home as the ambience of hotels and restaurants adds to the sense of occasion and hence to our well-being. It is also worth remembering that staff outings are very important to work relationships as people are able to relate at a much more casual and relaxed level without the inhibiting effects of status and hierarchy. \n Christmas is also a time for families to be together. People look forward to being united with loved-ones. Unfortunately the stresses of Christmas mar the occasion and often rows and arguments occur. These are very damaging to everyone concerned and become a further source of stress. What a pity to spoil a brief holiday with unnecessary tensions. This problem also occurs at such occasions as weddings and funerals when people who do not see each other often are together in close and unfamiliar proximity. \n To many people the run up to Christmas Day is the most pleasant part of the season with people enjoying the high they get from the increased activity. As well as planning for Christmas Day, enjoying outings, organising shopping, people tend to spend money on themselves - as if they need the extra thrill that comes with spending and acquiring something new. \n And so to Christmas Day. I often hear people say afterwards:  \"It was very quiet.\"  It is as if they were disappointed - as if they expected the hustle of the previous week or so to continue. Christmas Day is quiet for most people Unfortunately some have a feeling of anticlimax - as if everyone else is having a better time than they. This is always a problem if one looks for the ultimate. Nothing is ever good enough. \n IF we expect too much of Christmas Day and indeed any other event, we leave ourselves in the position of having nowhere to go with our emotions other than downwards - which is deflating. So, how about accepting Christmas Day as it is, not forgetting that the main purpose is a celebration of our religious heritage and enjoy it. \n Finally, Christmas is followed by the New Year. An important event for us all when we become more aware of ourselves, our life and the year that has passed. It is important to use the few days before the 1st of January to reflect on the previous year and to decide how we will react within the new year. While 'New Year Resolutions' are often treated lightly, here is a wonderful opportunity to work on change. For example, many smokers choose the New Year as the date to stop smoking, people start diets, others plan changes in their work or lifestyle. There is a great power in using the New Year as the extra impetus to a major decision. \n In the meantime -  Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.  \n\n\n<$B>\n  Profit from progress, message for industry  \n THE FORMATION of a quality food chain...detailed knowledge of physical and financial performance on-farm...attention to animal welfare and environmental issues... protection of our high animal health status...feed formulation to reach the genetic potential at each growth stage and very close attention to management detail were all outlined as means to ensure the survival of the pig industry in Province, by speakers at the NI Pig Conference, held at Cookstown this week. \n The conference, which was organised and sponsored by John Thompson <*> ampersand </*> Sons, Elanco Animal Health and NuTec Holdings (Irl) Ltd, attracted a wide audience with all aspects of the industry, from production to processing being represented. \n  Victor Truesdale,  sales director with John Thompson <*> ampersand </*> Sons, summing up the wealth of information, said:  \"Some of the measures outlined are in the control of the individual farmer but others will require industry wide co-operation if they are to be achieved. \n \"However if we are serious about our industry we have to tackle these issues in a meaningful way.\"  \n Industry measures outlined at the conference included the possibility of a quality food chain where all sectors get together to produce a quality product that has consumer confidence, and will attract premium markets. Strict quality control and meaningful financial incentives should be used to maintain such a structure. \n A total industry effort will be required to maintain our high animal health status and to find systems that will meet all EU requirements for animal welfare and environmental pollution. \n The opportunities for the feed industry and producers to work together to target specific growth stages of the pig were also highlighted. \n  FINANCING THE ENTERPRISE:  Discussing how his bank might react to a request for a substantial loan for a new pig unit on a green field site,  Stephen Smith,  Agricultural Adviser to the Ulster Bank, pointed out that the pig industry was characterised by fluctuations in profitability, a decline in pig prices in real terms and difficulties in the processing sector. \n With this industry image the bank will insist on detailed financial information on the farm to highlight past performance and to draw up a realistic and flexible business plan for the future. \n A new unit would have to conform to welfare and environmental disease unit. The extra costs which such measures would entail must all be built into the business plan, plus working capital for the purchase and maintenance of stock until the first animals are sold. \n Stephen Smith produced figures to show that the annual cost of repaying the loan plus interest over a 10-year period could vary from <*> pound sign </*> 22.60 per pig where 17 pigs are sold per sow per year, to <*> pound sign </*> 16.70 where 23 pigs are sold per sow. \n He pointed out that such expenditure is very difficult to justify when it is compared with an average margin over feed for the past five years of <*> pound sign </*> 15.35, as recorded in John Thompson <*> ampersand </*> Sons 'management plan. \n He said:  \"Some other source of capital and/or source of repayment is therefore desirable.\"  \n Income from other enterprises can over disruption to cash flow in the early stages, but a high standard of management and a business-like approach are essential in the long term to minimise the effect of repayments. \n Farmers could also consider returns from other sources such as sale of breeding stock and selling to specialised outlets. \n However, Stephen Smith 's viewpoint is that the real hope for the future of the industry is the establishment of a quality food chain where there is feedback of information from the consumer and where the achievement of the standards required command a meaningful premium to ensure loyalty to the chain. \n Stephen pointed out that 100 per cent finance is not usually attractive to the banks and farmers could reduce the initial debt by joint ventures. A joint venture with a feed compounder or pig processor could provide some stability in profitability and could also form part of the quality food chain which seems the most likely survival route for the industry.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "61b0fcf4-f615-45a5-9bc6-7cb469d352bd", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.629175+00:00"}
{"text": "<Growing old>\n\n\n<$A>\n GROWING OLD \n The fact that most people can now look forward to a long and healthy life is one of the great achievements of modern man. During this century, there have been dramatic increases in the average life expectancy. Throughout history, of course, there has been a small group of 'biologically elite' who lived into old age, some even surviving into advanced old age. However, even in comparatively recent years, the change has been dramatic. The number of centenarians in the UK has increased from around 250 in 1950 to about 4000 today.\n Two Irish women famed for their long lives were the sixteenth-century Countess of Desmond and the Honourable Katherine Plunket who died earlier this century. The Countess of Desmond, who lived in the castle of Inchiquin near Youghal in Co. Cork, is said to have lived to be 140. According to one of her contemporaries:\n  She might have lived longer had she not mette with a kind of violent death, where she must need climb a nutt tree to gather nutts, soe falling down she hurt her thighe, which brought a fever, and that brought death. \n The Honourable Katherine Plunket of Ballymascanlan House, Co. Louth, was born in 1820. She was an enthusiastic gardener, and in September 1931, when in her 111th year, she won a prize at the Dundalk show for her fruit and vegetable exhibit. She died a year later when she was almost 112 years old.\n AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY \n Although there are now over 400,000 people aged over sixty-five in the Republic of Ireland, forming more than 11 per cent of the total population, Ireland still has the lowest life expectancy in the EC. The sixty-year-old European female can expect to live another 22.1 years on average, compared with only twenty years for the Irish female. The mean for the sixty-year-old European man is nearly eighteen years, while it is only sixteen years for the Irish male. From these figures, it is clear that, on average, women live four years longer than men, and that people in Ireland die, on average, two years earlier than the average European. \n The main causes of death in Ireland are heart disease, cancer, lung disease and stroke. The fact that there is now more emphasis on a healthier lifestyle, as well as an increased awareness of good health care in later years, should improve the life expectancy of the average Irish person. A seventy-five-year-old woman can now expect to live for another ten years, a fact that emphasises the importance of good health care in old age. Ten years is a long time a person 's life, so everything possible should be done to ensure that the years are of high quality. While this is desirable for humanitarian reasons, it also makes good economic sense in this increasingly mercenary age.\n A UNIQUE POPULATION PROFILE \n People are living longer now because of improved environmental factors. Better housing, clean water, improved sewerage systems, healthier diets \u00d0 all of these have played a part. In the past, old age was the privilege of the few. Now, it is regarded as the birthright of all. We need a fundamental rethink on the whole subject of growing old. We must accept that most people expect to live long lives. It should therefore be our aim to make the quality of a person 's last twenty years as good as the previous years. \n SOME MISCONCEPTIONS \n It is a common error to view the elderly as a single homogeneous group. Yet they are as different as any other age group in society. There are the usual distinctions associated with current or previous employment, social status and education. Although problems with health certainly are more common for those over seventy-five, even in advanced old age, the majority of people still live at home. \n There is a general assumption that health and physical ability decline remorselessly with advancing years. This is simply not the case. One study carried out by Duke University in the US followed a group of elderly people over several years. They found that half of those who returned regularly for assessment suffered no decline in physical ability during periods ranging from three to thirteen years. \n Sexuality in older years has been a taboo subject for many years, yet research has shown that many older people still enjoy enriching and fulfilling sexual relationships. Couples who share an active sexual relationship in their younger years usually continue this relationship as they grow older. \n Ageing is part of the natural cycle that begins at conception and ends with death. It is therefore important to distinguish between chronological age and biological age. Two people aged seventy might have been born on the same day, but they may have aged at different rates, making one biologically much younger than the other. Even in the same person, organs can age at different rates. For example, the heart of one seventy-year-old person may compare favourably with that of a sixty-year-old, even though other parts of the body such as the skin may be more like that of the typical seventy-year-old. \n Changes associated with ageing should not be confused with those caused by disease. Changes associated with ageing do not cause significant disability on their own. Complaints should never be dismissed with glib comments such as, 'What can you expect at your age?' If such a question is posed, the appropriate answer should be, 'Good health care!' People should be aware of the importance of distinguishing between the changes associated with normal ageing and those associated with illness. The treatment of illness in old age, as at any age, can bring about remarkable improvements in a person 's quality of life. \n OLD AGE AND MODERN MEDICINE \n Despite the fact that older people can live healthy and active lives, there is still an unacceptably high level of illness associated with age. Conditions such as Parkinson 's disease, Alzheimer 's disease, arthritis and stroke all impair the quality of life for a small but significant percentage of older people. This fact presents modern medicine with one of its greatest challenges. At the beginning of this century, serious illness and disability were common in childhood and accepted as part of life. The concentrated efforts of pioneering paediatricians and medical scientists changed this situation so that serious illness in childhood is now unusual. The illnesses of old age are now being tackled by an increasing number of physicians and medical research institutes who specialise in the medical problems of the elderly. Consequently, many more people will be able to grow old without major disabilities. \n Experts who make gloomy predictions about ageing often assume that, over the next twenty years, people will age in the same way that people did in the last twenty years. This is a fundamental error. People who are growing older today are far healthier than older people of a similar age twenty or thirty years ago. \n AGEING SKIN \n Contrary to popular opinion, ageing itself does not produce many changes in the skin. Thin skin, pigment changes and wrinkles are mainly caused by exposure to the sun. Ultra violet light is also responsible for the hard or keratotic patches seen on the faces of some older people. It also causes skin cancers, including malignant melanoma. Some older people can develop very thin skin, especially on the backs of the hands and the forearms. This is harmless and is the result of poor elasticity in the skin tissues. These changes can also lead to easy bruising which is slow to resolve. Itchiness can be due to excessively dry skin, although there can be other causes. If it persists, a doctor should be consulted. \n VISION \n Eyesight should be checked regularly as it can be affected by a variety of ageing and disease processes. A rapid build-up of fluid pressure within the eye can cause severe pain, blurred vision and vomiting. This condition needs urgent treatment.\n More commonly, pressure can build up gradually and lead to an insidious loss of eyesight. People are often unaware that this condition, known as glaucoma, can have a silent and painless onset. A considerable amount of vision can be lost before it is detected.\n There are several causes of sudden visual disturbance in older people. An acute change is always a medical emergency. It should be reported to a doctor immediately, as urgent action is often required if the vision is to be saved.\n Most people have heard of cataract formation which is caused by an opacification of the lens. However, it is still surprising that many people allow their vision to go almost completely before they seek help. Modern technology has revolutionised the treatment of cataracts. \n Some older men and women develop a condition known as macular degeneration which damages the retina and leads to marked visual problems. High magnification lenses can be helpful in dealing with this problem. \n HEARING PROBLEMS \n It has been estimated that over half of older people develop hearing problems. There is an age-related decline in the ability to hear higher frequencies, and this makes it particularly difficult to hear consonants. As consonants convey much of the sense of speech, high frequency loss can greatly impair in individual 's ability to follow a conversation. \n Age changes in hearing begin in middle age. They often become apparent when a person experiences an increasing difficulty in following conversations, especially when there is any background noise. Those who have significant high frequency hearing loss can be helped with a hearing aid. Modern aids are quite sophisticated in design and function. They amplify certain frequencies and have noise-suppression units that make it easier to follow speech in a noisy environment. \n Impacted wax is a common and treatable cause of hearing loss. The amount of moisture within the ear canal declines with age so that wax secreted by the skin glands tends to become dry and hard. Removal of this wax can 'cure' the resulting deafness.\n Whatever the cause of a hearing loss, it is important that it should be investigated and treated early. If deafness is ignored, the person who is affected can become socially isolated and depressed. \n MUSCLE AND BONE \n The density of bone tends to decline in both sexes from the fourth decade. Excessive thinning of the bone structure, known as osteoporosis, can lead to fractures of the limb bones or of the small vertebral bones of the spine. Loss of bone density can affect women, particularly after the menopause. This may be stopped by the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). \n Among the other causes of osteoporosis are lack of exercise and an inadequate diet. An adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is essential for healthy bones. Vitamin D is found in fish oils and margarine and, to a lesser extent, in eggs. Milk fortified with vitamin D is now available commercially. The body can also make its own vitamin D if the skin is exposed to sunlight. If vitamin D is lacking, normal strong bone is replaced by poor-quality soft bone, a condition known as osteomalacia. Apart from bone changes, osteomalacia can also lead to muscle weakness. The condition causes bone pain, weakness, difficulty in walking and recurrent fractures. \n There are some age-related changes in the joints. However, the decline in joint function most commonly found in later life is due to osteoarthritis. In this condition, the cartilage is damaged and the joints become painful and swollen.\n There are several methods of treating osteoarthritis, including physiotherapy and medication. Joint replacement can also revolutionise the quality of life for many with this severe disease. (There is further information in the chapter, 'Arthritis and Rheumatism'.)\n BLOOD PRESSURE \n Blood pressure tends to rise with age, and doctors accept higher levels as 'normal' for older people. The decision about whether to treat high blood pressure in old age is based on factors such as the level of the pressure, and evidence of damage to organs such as the heart and brain, and whether the person will be able to tolerate the treatment involved. Blood pressure should be checked periodically as part of a routine medical assessment, as significant and untreated high blood pressure can lead to conditions such as stroke.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d425378d-4c33-4599-86ff-793877924575", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.630088+00:00"}
{"text": "<Atlantic fortifications>\n\n\n<$A>\n Atlantic fortifications \u00d0 THE DUNS OF THE ARAN ISLANDS \n Stone forts are a common element of the archaeological record in the west of Ireland and are particularly numerous in areas such as the Dingle peninsula in Co. Kerry, the Burren in Co. Clare and parts of west Donegal. The majority are regarded as cashels \u00d0 the stone equivalent of the earthen ringforts which occur throughout the country, and which are generally considered to be homesteads dating to the Early Christian period.\n The Western Stone Fort project was set up to look at a specific group of large stone forts, which are distinguished from the majority of cashels and promontory forts by their commanding locations, highly developed defensive features and distinctive architecture. About thirty or so of these forts are known to exist, with Grian&/an Aileach, Co. Donegal, Staigue, Co. Kerry and D&/un Aonghasa on the Aran Islands, Co. Galway, being the best known examples.\n In the second half of the nineteenth century D&/un Aonghasa in particular received much attention from scholars, antiquarians and romanticists some of whom at least shared the view of William Wilde that the fort was a  'stronghold prepared as the last standing place of the Firbolg aborigines of Ireland'.  As a result perhaps of their perceived heroic status, almost half of these large stone forts were restored during the Celtic Revival movement towards the end of the last century. Since then, with the exception of the pioneering work carried out by T.J. Westropp in Co. Clare, most of these monuments have not been closely studied. One of the primary aims of the Western Stone Fort Project is to compile an inventory of these large stone forts, examine their distribution and siting, and compare their architectural features.\n Substantial archaeological excavation has been carried out this century at four sites: Cathair Chom&/ain, Co. Clare, and Leacnbuaile, Dunbeg and Loher, Co. Kerry. The majority of the published examples have been assigned by their excavators to the Early Christian period, but there is evidence for earlier activity at Dunbeg, where charcoal from a ditch or trench predating the stone rampart yielded a radiocarbon data of 802-534 cal. BC. The eighth-century AD date which the excavator assigned to Cathair Chom&/ain in 1938 is now challenged by archaeologists who suggest that some of the artefacts found there could well have a pre-Christian date.\n There are other indications of a pre-Christian origin for some of these forts. The presence of a  chevaux de frise  (upright pillars of stone set at close intervals as a defensive obstacle) at D&/un Aonghasa and D&/ucathair on Inis M&/or, Aran Islands and at Cathair Bhaile Cinn Mhargaidh (Ballykinvarga) in the Burren, suggests links with forts in Spain, Wales and Scotland where this feature also occurs. Architecturally many of the Irish sites are comparable to Iron Age stone forts along the Atlantic seaboard of western Europe. Whether these links represent the spread of ideas, or the movement of people along the Atlantic seaways is a matter of opinion at present, but some scholars would look to this route as the possible artery along which Celtic influences first reached Ireland. Looking at the Irish forts then against the background of contemporary settlement and culture in the area often referred to as 'the Atlantic Province' also forms part of the Western Stone Fort Project. \n  The forts on the Aran Islands  \n Most of the fieldwork associated with the project to date has been concentrated on the Aran Islands. The Aran Islands are strategically located across the mouth of Galway Bay and are outliers of the main Burren limestone plateau. The islands are noted for their wealth of archaeological remains, outstanding among which are seven large stone forts. Four of these (D&/un Aonghasa, D&/ucathair, D&/un Eoghanachta and D&/un Eochla) are located on Inis M&/or, the largest of the three islands; D&/un Chonch&/uir and D&/un Fearbha&/i are located on Inis Me&/ain and D&/un Formna lies on Inis O&/irr, the smallest and most southerly of the three islands. \n The forts vary considerably in size and in the complexity of their defences. D&/un Aonghasa, with an enclosed area of 5.7 hectares (14 acres), is by far the largest, and the labour required for its construction implies a considerable community effort. Whether that effort was voluntary or in response to a coercive power we can only surmise, but such an elaborate undertaking would appear to have been prompted by political or military factors. In contrast, the simple univallate fort of D&/un Eoghanachta encloses less than a third of an acre and may have been built to reflect the status or power of a wealthy individual. D&/un Fearbha&/i and D&/un Formna are also univallate sites, though larger and of more irregular plan. A medieval towerhouse now stands in the interior of D&/un Formna. Three of the forts (D&/un Aonghasa, D&/un Eochla and D&/un Chonch&/uir) are multivallate. D&/un Chonch&/uir was additionally protected on the eastern side by a substantial bastion. The remaining site, D&/ucathair, is a promontory fort defended by a massive stone wall, with the  chevaux de frise  providing an additional line of defence on the landward side. Its exposed location has resulted in severe erosion of the upstanding remains since it was first recorded by the Ordnance Survey in the nineteenth century. \n The remains of huts are visible in the interiors at D&/un Chonch&/uir, D&/ucathair and D&/un Eoghanachta. A variety of ground plans are represented \u00d0 circular, heel-shaped, rectangular with rounded corners, and irregular. Without excavation it is not possible to assign a date to these huts. The examples at D&/un Eoghanachta certainly postdate the    construction   of the fort and may belong to a period after the main occupation. The refurbished huts within D&/ucathair and D&/un Chonch&/uir appear to be contemporary with the final development of the defences at each site. They may also be contemporary with each other \u00d0 both consist of a complex of conjoined 'cloch&/an type' structures, with possible entrance passages and featureless doorways. The ruined foundations of a second group of huts are visible along the exposed western edge of the promontory at D&/ucathair. The rectangular ground plan with rounded internal corners is typical of a number of the cloch&/ans which survive on Inis M&/or \u00d0 well preserved examples include two cloch&/ans near Eoghanacht church and Cloch&/an na Carraige near the village of Cill Mhuirbhigh.\n  D&/un Aonghasa  \n D&/un Aonghasa is dramatically located at the edge of steep cliffs which form a more or less continuous band along the southern coast of Inis M&/or. The site commands a spectacular view from Connemara on the north to the cliffs of Moher on the east and, on a clear day, Mt. Brandon on the Dingle Peninsula can be seen on the skyline to the south. \n The cliff-top location and the complexity of its defences link D&/un Aonghasa with the hillfort tradition. About fifty hillforts have been recognised to date in Ireland, and most are generally considered to have been built in the Iron Age. Intensive study of hillforts in Britain has indicated a complex development from Late Bronze Age beginning down to the end of the first millennium BC or early centuries AD. \n The substantial inner citadel at D&/un Aonghasa also links this site with the ringfort tradition and therefore the monument, as it survives today, probably incorporates alterations and refurbishments carried out at intervals over a long period of time \u00d0 perhaps as long as a thousand years. \n There are three main enclosing walls, each terminating at the cliff edge along the south. An additional wall in the west sector now appears to begin and end abruptly. The walls are of drystone construction and were terraced on the interior face; steps leading up to the terraces survive on the inner two walls. The broad band of  chevaux de frise  outside the middle enclosure is up to 38m wide in places and still proves a    formidable   obstacle today, with individual pillarstones standing up to 1.75m in height. \n The three main walls subdivide the interior into areas of quite separate character. Much of the outer enclosure is characterised by steeply falling ground and areas of bare weathered limestone. The inhospitable exposed terrain, and the location of the  chevaux de frise  along its inward perimeter, suggest that this area may have been used mainly for animals. In contrast, the middle enclosure affords some protection from the prevailing winds and consists of fairly level ground, with some soil cover. A number of possible hut sites have been identified here in the course of recent fieldwork. \n The inner enclosure surrounded on three sides by a massive wall up to 4.9m in height and 5.8m in thickness, is elevated above the remainder of the fort. There are two terraces on the interior of the wall and there is some evidence to suggest that the inner terrace was a later addition. The entrance to the inner enclosure is through a monumental gateway in the north-east, but a chamber in the wall on the west side may be an earlier blocked-up entrance. It is likely that some protective walling existed along the cliff edge during the occupation of the site. The interior is level, broken only by a platform of bedrock at the cliff edge. It has been suggested that this platform formed the focus of ritual activity during the Iron Age. The rock was certainly left in place deliberately and its present table-like appearance is not completely natural, but there is no way of knowing now whether or not it had a special significance for the builders of the fort. \n  Excavation  \n Two seasons of excavation have now been completed at D&/un Aonghasa and a further season is planned for the coming summer. Most of the excavation to date has been concentrated in the western half of the inner enclosure. Here, the remains of a number of hut sites have been uncovered. The best preserved example is roughly circular in plan and 4.8m in diameter. The walls were formed of low orthostats and there was an entrance in the east side. The western edge of the hut now lies under the lower terrace of the inner enclosure wall. It seems unlikely that the single slabs which made up the wall could have formed the foundations of a cloch&/an-type dwelling and the superstructure may, therefore, have been of wood. \n The interior of the hut had a paved floor and there was a stone-lined hearth. The occupation layer overlying the floor contained limpet shells and a few periwinkle shells, sheep, cattle and pig bones and a small number of guillemot bones. Finds included coarse pottery, mainly from bucket-shaped vessels used for cooking, part of a clay mould for casting a bronze spearhead, two crucible fragments and a finely carved bone pin. \n A short distance outside the doorway of this hut the remains of a broadly contemporary stone-lined trough were preserved. The trough was over 1m in length, 0.6m wide and 0.35m deep, and was filled with stony clay containing animal bone. The only artefact recovered was part of a bead made from pumice. A sample of animal bone gave a date range of 752-392 cal. BC. \n The exact function of this trough is difficult to determine. At Skara Brae in the Orkney Islands, similar stone troughs were found set into the floors of the Neolithic houses, and are thought to have been storage tanks for shellfish. Stone troughs also occur at  fulachta fiadh,  where they were used in cooking. The lack of fresh water in the immediate vicinity of D&/un Aonghasa may make this interpretation less likely, but it is possible that like the present day Aran Islanders, the occupants collected rainwater. \n Both the trough and the hut overlay earlier occupation material. No definite structures associated with this earlier occupation have been found within the inner enclosure but a second cutting, opened just outside it to the north, contained the remains of a fairly crude hut. The walls of this hut were formed of irregular uprights and, along the west, the hut was butted up against the remains of a wall. A radiocarbon date from animal bone in the occupation layer gave a date of 900-450 cal. BC.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "df9b217f-c4af-42e9-93e5-556f7a64a751", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.631260+00:00"}
{"text": "<Cannabis>\n\n\n<W2B>-028$A>\n  CANNABIS  \n Cannabis is one of the oldest plants cultivated by man. Archaeological evidence from a Stone Age village, excavated on the island of Taiwan, suggests that mankind has been using the plant  Cannabis sativa  from earliest times. \n The cannabis plant is a very adaptable annual, which can grow in most parts of the world including Ireland. In its chequered career, it has been grown for its long fibres known as hemp fibre, for its seed (hemp seed), used as a source of oil and for bird seed, and most notably for the intoxicating resin produced in its leaves, flowers and fruits. The drug form of cannabis has also been used for many centuries in many countries as a medicine. The characteristic chemicals called cannabinoids (of which there are at least 60 found in the plant) are currently being tested for use in modern medicine to treat glaucoma (a disease which causes gradual blindness), to prevent the nausea and vomiting caused by some anti-cancer drugs, and possibly to treat epilepsy. \n The cannabis plant produces over 400 different chemicals, the most important of which are the main psychoactive compounds, the tetrahydrocannabinols (THC). However other cannabinoids may modify the effect of THC. Different cannabis products contain different amounts of THC. Herbal cannabis, known as marijuana, pot, grass or dope contains between 0 and 11 <*> per cent sign </*> of THC, depending on the source. The resin, known as hashish or 'hash', contains between 1 and 26 <*> per cent sign </*> THC. The resin is squeezed or scraped from the flowering tops of the plant, and then compressed into blocks or slabs and not allowed to solidify. This is the commonest form of cannabis used in Ireland. The strongest form of cannabis is an oil called 'hash oil' prepared by extracting or distilling the cannabinoids from the plant. This form generally contains about 30 <*> per cent sign </*> of THC but samples containing up to 60 <*> per cent sign </*> of THC have been encountered. Abroad it has been noted that the marijuana now on the market is at 7 <*> per cent sign </*> of THC, over 600 times more potent than in 1974 and at times may be even stronger than hash even though the herb form is usually considered to be the weakest form of the drug. Little is known about the THC content of the cannabis drugs available in Ireland. One sample of cannabis grown in Ireland was found to contain nearly 4 <*> per cent sign </*> of THC, while other samples were nearly devoid of any active drug. In Ireland cannabis is usually smoked in home-made cigarettes called 'joints'. In the case of the resin and oil they are usually mixed with tobacco. Cannabis can also be smoked in pipes, made into a drink or put into cakes or biscuits. The variation in THC content described above makes it difficult to accurately predict the effects of a given sample of cannabis. Adding to this variability is the fact that the amount of cannabis used per dose also varies considerably. One study has shown the THC content of street 'joints' to vary from 0.15 mg up to 41 mg where 5 mg of THC per joint would be the minimum for a drug effect to occur. \n  Legal Status  \n All cannabis products are controlled by the Misuse of Drugs Act. Cannabis is included in Schedule 1 which prohibits its medical and non-medical use. It is therefore illegal to grow, produce, supply or possess any of the drugs except in accordance with a licence from the Minister of Health for research or analysis. It is also an offence to allow premises to be used for cultivating, supplying or smoking cannabis. The penalties for possession of small amounts of cannabis herb and cannabis resin for personal use are, for a first offence, a fine of up to <*> pound sign </*> 300 imposed by the District Court or up to <*> pound sign </*> 500 in the Circuit Court. For a second offence, the District Court can impose a fine of up to <*> pound sign </*> 400, which rises to <*> pound sign </*> 1,000 if imposed by the Circuit Court. In the case of a third or subsequent offence, the District Court can impose a maximum fine of <*> pound sign </*> 1,000 or 12 months in jail or both. If the case is heard before a judge and jury, the maximum penalty can be an open-ended fine or 3 years imprisonment, or both fine and prison sentence. Cultivation, supply and possession of the isolated chemicals (cannabinoids) are treated more severely. (See section on Drug Laws for further details). \n  Prevalence and Availability.  \n Cannabis is apparently the most widely used of the illegal drugs but we have no idea of exactly how many Irish people have experimented with it, or use it regularly. There is little doubt that cannabis use has increased dramatically since 1969. A survey of university students in Cork in 1977 showed that 19 <*> per cent sign </*> had experimented with the drug. The most recent indications are that 13 <*> per cent sign </*> of Dublin post primary school children surveyed had used cannabis at least once. The experimentation rate increased with age, with 2.3 <*> per cent sign </*> of those under 13 reporting use of the drug compared to 24.6 <*> per cent sign </*> in those 17 or over. Experimentation rates in rural school children are believed to be lower than those in Dublin. Large numbers of patients attending the Drug Clinic report cannabis use, and prosecutions for cannabis-related offences represent between 60 and 70 <*> per cent sign </*> of all prosecutions under the Misuse of Drugs Acts. \n Prices for different cannabis products range from <*> pound sign </*> 1 per gramme of homegrown herb, to <*> pound sign </*> 3 per gramme of imported herb. Cannabis resin such as Lebanese Gold, Pakistani Black or Moroccan Red can cost between <*> pound sign </*> 5 and <*> pound sign </*> 10 per gramme. The cannabis smuggled into Ireland comes from a variety of countries in North Africa, the Middle East, the Indian sub-continent and America. \n  Short-Term Effects.  \n The effects of cannabis depend on a number of factors, including the type of cannabis used (hash and hash oil have greater and longer lasting effects than the relatively weaker marijuana), the way it has been stored (cannabinoids are unstable in light and air), the amount used, the way it is taken, and the experience, mood and expectations of the user. \n When smoked, cannabis exerts its effects very quickly. The effects last up to one hour with low doses, and for several hours with higher doses. When it is eaten or drunk, it takes one to two hours to have an effect. The dose is not easily controlled and unpleasant reactions are more likely and more severe. Inexperienced cannabis users usually require some training in order to recognise the effects of the drug. \n The sought-after effects, referred to as the 'high', include talkativeness, hilarity, euphoria, relaxation and a feeling of slowed time. Usual doses of cannabis also interfere with short-term memory and learning ability, with obvious implications for students and school-children trying to learn while 'high'. The more complex the task the more it is likely to be disrupted. Frequent heavy cannabis users are likely to have poor academic records, high levels of absenteeism from class and a high drop-out rate from the educational system. Moderate doses may also interfere with clarity of speech, resulting in communication of irrelevant words and ideas. Recent studies in adolescents show that impairment of recent memory in heavy cannabis users is still detectable after a 6 week drug-free interval. Adult cannabis users in the U.S. also report memory impairment and 45 <*> per cent sign </*> of those surveyed stated that their ability to concentrate on complex tasks, to think clearly and to get things done was impaired. Motor co-ordination is also impaired at usual dose levels, affecting a person 's ability to operate machinery, fly a plane or drive a car. This impairment lasts for some hours after the 'high'. Evidence continues to increase in other countries showing that cannabis contributes to the high level of fatal car, truck, airplane and train crashes among cannabis users. In many studies cannabis users report higher rates of traffic accidents than non-users and the percentage of those killed or injured in accidents who had been smoking cannabis is the same as for alcohol users. The very common combination of alcohol and cannabis produces greater damage than either drug alone, although little is known about the consequences of using cannabis and other drugs together. \n An increasing number of cannabis users (especially the inexperienced) using the stronger forms of the drug now available report adverse reactions to the drug. These unpleasant reactions include fearfulness, confusion, severe panic and anxiety, paranoid reactions and hallucinations. These reactions, although frequently very frightening, rarely require medical attention and usually respond to reassurance. There would appear to be no danger of an overdose and no deaths in humans have been reported. \n  Long-Term Effects.  \n Because widespread regular use of cannabis by such groups as children, adolescents, girls and women is a relatively new phenomenon, the consequences of long-term use, particularly of the highly potent drugs now available, are less conclusively documented than the short term effects. A large number of studies with animals have consistently demonstrated toxic effects at doses comparable to those taken by humans who smoke marijuana several times a day. Studies of human cannabis users have been contradictory in their results and in many cases the evidence is inconclusive. This is probably due to the fact that the correct types of long-term studies on humans have not yet been carried out. \n When burned, cannabis cigarettes produce three times more carcinogenic 'tars' than tobacco and five times more poisonous carbon monoxide. Prolonged heavy use of the drug causes chronic bronchitis, cough, hoarseness, laryngitis and pre-cancerous changes in the lungs similar to those produced by tobacco smoke, except that the changes and lung damage occur more rapidly with cannabis smoke. Cannabis tar is directly carcinogenic in animals and earlier predictions that long-term cannabis use could lead to cases of cancer in humans are proving accurate in that cases of lung, head and neck cancer have been reported in young cannabis smokers. In addition, babies born to mothers who smoked cannabis were, according to one report, ten times more likely to develop acute nonlymphoblastic leukaemia than babies whose mothers did not smoke cannabis. \n Cannabis is not usually considered to produce physical dependence, although tolerance to the effects occurs, and physical withdrawal symptoms have been noted after cessation of heavy use. Psychological dependence has been noted in some users. Cannabis increases the workload of the heart and people who suffer from heart disease, angina and blood pressure are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of cannabis. Another high risk group are those with pre-existing mental illness, particularly schizophrenia and depression, because cannabis may trigger off a relapse or make symptoms worse. There has been a steep increase in the number of patients admitted to Swedish psychiatric hospitals with a diagnosis of acute anxiety, delirium, schizophrenia and psychosis attributed to cannabis use. \n Among the other known or suspected long term effects of continuous cannabis use are decreased sperm count and sperm mobility, interference with ovulation and pre-natal development and impaired immune response. There is now a considerable body of evidence concerning the adverse effects of cannabis on both male and female reproductive systems. Not only does the drug affect the secretion of hormones and the reproductive glands directly but it also inhibits sexual activity and produces long-term alterations in the development of the reproductive system in male and female offspring in test animals. In addition, cannabinoid metabolites are highly fat soluble and remain in the body for several weeks. During that time the chemicals are concentrated in areas of the brain known to influence various aspects of sexual behaviour as well as in the endocrine and sex glands. \n There is also increasing evidence of problems arising if cannabis is smoked during pregnancy because the infant is exposed to the drug via the placenta and also through breast milk after it is born. Studies in the U.S. report that up to 27 <*> per cent sign </*> of pregnant women had used cannabis during pregnancy. The babies born to these mothers weighed less than those born to non-users and were significantly shorter in length. The cannabis babies had less muscle mass than normal and were more jittery, more irritable and less attentive. If the mother also used alcohol and tobacco, the combined effect of the three drugs was greater than any individual drug.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c33de5f8-138b-4ca6-9d37-d4562061ce8e", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.632270+00:00"}
{"text": "<Bees>\n\n\n<$A>\n Focus on Research By Michael Clancy \n  Prologue  \n Some years ago I visited Australia, and in the course of my travels from Perth in Western Australia right around to Rockhampton in Queensland I met many beekeepers, all of whom were most hospitable and friendly. On a visit to apiaries north of Perth, I was amazed at the size of the worker bees - \"fat\" bees my Australian host called them. These bees were on pollen collection at the time - early August, The beginning of the Australian Spring. Later at Garton Agricultural College - now a College of Queensland University - I met Graham Kleinschmidt who told me about his work on the importance of protein in the life of the honeybees. I was reminded of this work recently, when I read in an issue of the Australasian Beekeeper about the threatened closure of the internationally renowned Garton College Bee Research Centre. This, then, prompted me to write about the importance of pollen for honeybees. In doing so I must acknowledge how influential Australian research has been on this topic. \n  Honeybees and Pollen \n Introduction  \n The honeybee, like all other creatures, requires a balanced diet consisting of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, minerals and vitamins. The honeybee, however, is unusual in two respects, viz: (a)    its   two major nutrients, carbohydrates and proteins, are obtained from two different immediate sources, nectar and pollen respectively, and (b) it has a two-phasic system of digestion. Carbohydrates, in the form of simple sugars, are provided by nectar and honey, and are the honeybee 's main source of energy. Nectar and honey also contain very small quantities of proteins, lipids, minerals and growth factors. Pollen is the honeybee 's main source of protein, lipids, minerals and vitamins. Honey and pollen together provide all the nutrients, which are essential for the growth and development of the hypopharyngeal glands and the fat bodies of the winter bee  (1) Like all living creatures, honeybees also require water. \n  (to be continued) \n  Focus on Research  by Michael Clancy \n  Honeybees and Pollen  (  Continued  )  \n  Ingestion and Digestion  \n In view of the availability of both natural and substitute foods, it is worth recalling how the honeybee ingests and digests both sugars and proteins. Honeybees have two different feeding behaviour patterns, which are related both to the type of food and to their nutritional requirements. \n Honeybees, who require sugars feed on honey which they imbibe in liquid form through their extended proboscis. If they food contains more than 50 <*> per cent sign </*> sugars, the honeybee dilutes it with saliva from the salivary glands of    its   head and thorax so that it will readily pass up the food canal. Dry sugar is first dissolved and diluted in the same way. \n When honeybees feed on pollen - mostly from stored material or bee bread - their behaviour is quite different. The proboscis remains folded back under the head and the mandibles are used to scoop pollen from the honeycomb cell and to pass it directly into the mouth. Honeybees feeding on dry pollen exhibit the same behaviour. It has also been observed that when bees were given a mixture of dry sugar and pollen grains, some selected the pollen grains from the mixture with their mandibles, while other bees applied the tips of the proboscis to the sugar, imbibed the liquefied sugar and neglected the pollen. \n Ingested food is stored in the honeycrop. The two main foods, sugars and protein are separated both during storage and digestion. This separation is made in the proventriculus, which has three main functions: (a) it regulates the movement of sugars back to the ventriculus, (b) it acts as a one-way valve to prevent the movement of liquid from the ventriculus forward to the crop, and (c) to remove pollen grains from the crop so that the crop contents become a clear liquid of about 40 <*> per cent sign </*> sugars. These sugars are digested in the crop by enzymes secreted by the salivary glands, and which have been mixed with the food as it is ingested. \n As pollen is filtered out of the honeycrop by the proventriculus, it accumulates in the proventricular pouches, and as each pouch is filled, the pollen grains are forced back into the ventriculus, where they are enclosed in peritrophic membranes as discrete packages. The pollen is thus stored and digested over a period of several hours. In this way pollen digestion is separated from sugar digestion (1). \n  The Importance of Pollen  \n The importance of pollen lies in the fact that it is the honeybee 's main and natural source of protein. Protein influences the rate of breeding and longevity, making pollen the single most important factor in colony development and honey production. \n Honeybees in collecting pollen mix it with nectar or honey and saliva. They add micro-organisms to start a fermentation. On return to the hive this mixture is deposited in honeycomb cells, where it is layered over with honey and continues to ferment in a manner rather analogous to the ensilage of herbage. This product is called bee bread and in recent times over 200 microbes had been identified in it (10). Bee bread and honey are the two items of the honeybees ' stored food. This hoarded food enables the honeybee colony to generate heat, rear brood and survive periods when food is not available from plants. \n Protein from pollen is required to (a) feed larvae, (b) allow full development of young bees, and (c) repair tissue in older bees. While the high protein dietary requirement for young bees and breeding is well known, the large amount used by older bees, particularly the wax producers on a heavy flow, is usually not considered and this can be a major factor in colony rundown. For example the demand for protein by colonies storing quality protein. Consequently, not only breeding, but the harvesting of a heavy honey flow can require a high protein input (2). \n Estimates of the amount of pollen a honeybee may require vary considerably. The amount required to rear one kg of brood varies from half a kg to one kg (3). Studies in South West Queensland indicated that colonies used about 400 g pollen per week during Winter (Australian) and over 600 g per week in September (mid Australian Spring) (2). No doubt these variations are confounded by variations in the quality of the pollen proteins, and because of difference in climate it would be difficult to relate these Australian observations to the Irish situation. Nonetheless, it would appear that pollen requirements are greater than hitherto realised. \n Honeybee longevity depends on the protein content of    its   body. When the protein content exceeded 40 <*> per cent sign </*> , honeybees lived for 46-50 days, whereas bees below 40 <*> per cent sign </*> protein lived for 20-26 days, and the lower    its   body protein level it took disproportionally longer for a honeybee to regain    its   body protein with good quality pollen (4). \n In the absence of sufficient food protein, the honeybee while active will use    its   own body protein. During death periods the honeybee minimises    its   body protein depletion by reducing    its   activity, breeding, foraging etc. Insufficient protein during queen production can reduce queen quality and drones exposed to low protein diets can have reduced sperm counts (2). \n Susceptibility to infectious and non-infectious diseases is another consequence of inadequate protein levels. Nosema infection is a typical outcome of such poor conditions (5). \n To be continued \n  Focus on Research  by Michael Clancy \n  Honeybees and Pollen  (  Continued  ) \n  Pollen Variation  \n There are wide variations in the protein content (7 - 35 <*> per cent sign </*> ) of the different types of pollen and also in their biological or food values. Variety in pollen types collected by the honeybee can ensure that their food requirements are met. However, pollens with less than 20 <*> per cent sign </*> protein cannot satisfy colony requirements for optimum production (2). \n Moreover, proteins do vary very much in their food, or biological, value depending on the amount of essential amino    acids, which they contain. All proteins are formed from amino acids and there are eight to ten of these amino acids, which are regarded as determining the biological value of proteins. They are called essential, because as a general rule, most organisms cannot synthesise them and they must, therefore, form part of the diet. The essential amino acids required by the honeybee are arginine, histidine, lysine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, methionine, threanine, leucine, isoleucing and valine. Three others (glycine, proline and serine) which are not essential for growth, exert a stimulating effect on suboptimal growth (3). \n The absence of any one of the ten essential amino acids will have a direct effect on the development of brood, and young bee, and also on the longevity of the adult honeybee. Thus, both the amount and quality of dietary protein are of the utmost importance in the optimum performance of the honeybee. \n The honeybee does not appear to be able to distinguish between the nutritive values of various pollens and in times of pollen scarcity has been known to collect fungal spores and other non-pollens indiscriminately (6). \n  Pollen Substitutes  \n In view of the importance of protein in the diet of the honeybee it is not surprising that there have been many attempts to develop a pollen substitute. Regretfully, research to date has not been successful and it appears that some pollen is required in artificial diets to stimulate the development of the pharyngeal glands, which secrete the protein rich \"bee milk\" (7). \n In the introduction above, the heterogeneous nature of protein digestion is described, from with it appears that honeybee digestion favours insoluble proteins. Lack of success in substitute pollens may be due to the use of soluble proteins. Certainly, the value of feeding soluble amino acids, in the absence of insoluble protein, can be legitimately questioned. \n Research to-date indicates that there is no satisfactory substitute for pollen. Current thinking favours the harvesting and preservation of pollen for later bee feeding. Fresh pollen is a very perishable material and it should either be carefully dried or frozen. Drying must be carried out at temperatures under 45 <*> degrees sign </*> C, with a gradual removal of moisture. It can then be milled to a fine powder and used as required either directly or incorporated in syrup of honey (7). Alternatively, fresh pollen can be deep-frozen and is an excellent option. \n The spread of disease, e.g. American foulbrood, is a very real possibility when feeding honeybees and particularly so in the case of pollen feeding.    Protection   afforded by irradiating the pollen and beekeepers should check that any pollen powder or pellets they purchase is sterilised by irradiation. The irradiation itself has no significant effect on the nutritional quality of the pollen - neither is irradiated pollen radioactive (7). \n  Irish Pollens  \n Pollen from Irish flora is likely to be of differing nutritional value to the honeybee. Unfortunately, no work has been done on Irish pollen from this point of view. However, there is some indication that wind-pollinated plants produce pollen of low nutritive value, while most insect-pollinated plants produce pollen which is of high value to the honeybee (1). Provided that the honeybee gathers from a variety of sources there is little likelihood that pollen quality will be poor. Rather, it is amount of pollen, especially in Autumn, which may be the limiting factor in colony development if not survival. For this reason it would be good honeybee husbandry to set up pollen traps when pollen is plentiful. The British black bee is an inveterate pollen gatherer and clogs its brood with pollen (8). This behaviour leads to swarming, but this can be prevented by the use of pollen traps (9).", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "5ee59ea2-beb2-4c82-89f4-5510e1238c03", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.633202+00:00"}
{"text": "<Turloughs>\n\n\n<$A>\n<$B>\n<$C>\n ENFO - promoting care of the environment\n TURLOUGHS  \n  TURLOUGHS are lakes which disappear for part of the year, leaving a floor covered with grasses, sedges and herbs. They occur in limestone areas west of the Shannon and are unique to Ireland. Their flora and fauna are very interesting, and if there is one in your area, it is an ideal site for an environmental study. Many turloughs have been drained and both arterial drainage and local drainage by farmers threaten those that remain. Some representative turloughs should be conserved, as it would be a tragedy if this unique part of our heritage were to disappear forever.  \n  SEASONAL LAKES  \n If you drive through part of eastern Galway or Mayo in the winter, you will see a large number of lakes and you may be puzzled that they do not appear on the half-inch to a mile Ordnance Survey maps. If you look a bit closer, you may wonder why some of the lakes have walls leading down into them, or telegraph poles in the middle of them. Then, if you return to the area in the summer, you will find no sign of these lakes, but instead a landscape with green fields and grazing cattle. Only a few clues, such as the black moss covering the stone walls, indicate that these are no ordinary fields. In fact, they are turloughs.\n Turlough, or  turlach  , is the word used to describe these strange disappearing lakes which are found in limestone areas of Ireland, mostly west of the Shannon. The name is thought to come from the Irish \"tur loch\", meaning dry lake. The features are unique to Ireland and they are an important part of our heritage. They are of great interest to many scientists: geomorphologists (who study landforms) are interested in how turloughs were formed, hydrologists (who study water) try to explain what makes turloughs flood, botanists study the unusual vegetation which covers the    turlough 's   floor and zoologists study the animals associated with the turloughs. Because they have so many interesting aspects, turloughs provide an ideal opportunity for local environmental studies. \n Turloughs are mostly found on the central lowlands west of the Shannon, in counties Galway, Clare, Mayo and Roscommon, although a few are also found elsewhere, e.g. in Limerick, Sligo and Longford. Most turloughs flood in the autumn, usually some time in October, and then dry up some time between April and July. However, some turloughs in the Burren can flood at any time of year in a matter of a few hours after heavy rainfall and they may empty again a few days later. A few turloughs are affected by the tide: in the summer, Caherglassaun Lough, which is 5 km from Galway Bay, can be seen to flood and empty again twice every 24 hours. Most turloughs flood to a depth of about 2 metres but some are much deeper: for example, some of the turloughs near Gort are about five metres (16 ft.) deep in midwinter. Turloughs are variable in size: the largest turlough in Ireland, Rahasane, which lies to the west of Craughwell in Co. Galway, covers about 250 hectares (or 500 football pitches!).\n  WHY DO TURLOUGHS OCCUR?  \n All of the turloughs are found in limestone areas. This is because limestone is a unique rock in that it can be dissolved away by rainwater, particularly rainwater that has become acidic by picking up carbon dioxide as it passes through the soil. The cracks or  joints  in the rock become widened to such an extent that eventually all of the rain falling on the limestone disappears underground and the water moves through the rock openings ranging from cracks a few millimetres wide to large cave passages. The limestone is then said to  karstified  . To the east of the Shannon, the limestone is often covered by great thicknesses of glacial drift deposited during the Ice Age but in many areas to the west of the Shannon where the limestone is pure and the drift cover is thin, there is no proper surface river network. In these areas, rainfall disappears underground, flows through openings in the rock and then rises at springs: large springs are found to the west of the area, flowing into Lough Corrib and Galway Bay. In winter, when the underground water level (or  water table  ) rises, and when the underground flow routes to the springs are not capable of dealing with the amount of water entering them, groundwater may appear temporarily at the surface in the form of a turlough. Many of the rivers seen in these areas today are largely artificial, constructed by drainage engineers from the nineteenth century to the present day, often linking a series of turloughs. For example, much of the Clare river is artificial and the middle section of its course used to be a huge turlough - the largest in Ireland at 650 hectares.\n  SWALLOW HOLES  \n Turloughs usually fill and empty at particular places on the floor: sometimes an actual hold or passage is visible but more often a hollow with stones in the bottom is all that can be seen and it may not be easy to recognise when it is dry in midsummer. Some turloughs have a spring at one place and a swallow hole somewhere else on the floor where water drains away, but many turloughs fill and empty through the same hole. A few turloughs are filled by rivers and streams flowing into them as well by water rising from underground.\n The water sinking in the swallow hole travels underground to a spring, which may be several kilometres away. In most rock types, groundwater flows very slowly (from just a few centimetres to a few metres per day), but in karstified limestone the flow rate can be quite rapid: water from the turlough may flow underground to a spring at a rate of 100 metres per hour or more. \n  CALCIUM CARBONATE  \n Limestone is made up of the mineral calcium carbonate and as water passes through limestone, it dissolves the calcium carbonate - this is what makes the water hard and causes furring on the inside of kettles, as the calcium carbonate comes out of solution when the water is heated. Something rather similar happens in turloughs - water which has picked up a lot of calcium carbonate during its underground travel rises in the turloughs and then some of the calcium carbonate comes out of solution and forms a white deposit. So if you visit a turlough which has emptied recently, you may notice a whitish coating on the vegetation on the turlough floor. (The reason why the calcium carbonate is deposited is that when the water comes to the surface in a turlough, it loses carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere and to plants which use it for photosynthesis and this loss causes the calcium carbonate to come out of solution.) \n Sometimes a special whitish deposit which has the appearance of sheets of paper is found in the turloughs when they dry up. This \"algal paper\" is made up of filaments of an alga which grows abundantly in warm weather and is then left to dry out in sheets when the turlough empties. \n If you look at a section in a drainage ditch in a turlough, or if you make a hole with a soil auger, you may find a white or cream coloured deposit beneath the vegetation cover, or beneath a layer of peat. This is often called \"white marl\" - again it is made of calcium carbonate. About half of the turloughs contain marl: it was deposited at a time several thousand years ago when these turloughs were not seasonal lakes but were flooded all year round. \n  PLANT AND ANIMAL LIFE  \n Most turloughs have a springy, short-cropped turf of grasses, sedges and herbs. In the Burren, the highwater-mark is often shown by the shrubby cinquefoil with its attractive yellow flowers, and meadow rue. Just below, dog violets are abundant and in some turloughs there may be a dense sward of the rare sky-blue turlough violet about one metre further down. Other characteristic plant of turlough sides include orchids and speedwell. About half way down the sides, and across the bottom of shallow turloughs, silverweed may blanket almost all other plants. \n If the turlough has a marshy zone near the swallow hole, there may be mint, water-cress, pond-weeds, aquatic buttercups and knotgrass, living a semi-terrestrial existence. But most swallow holes when dry are represented by a jumble of rocks, clothes with blackish and dried aquatic mosses ( Cinclidotus  , the turlough moss and  Fontinalis  , usually found in streams). \n Many people think that turloughs have no animal life. However, frogs and newts may spawn there and sticklebacks may survive in the larger turloughs, retreating into underground cracks in the rock when waters are low. Shrimp and water-lice do the same and where fish are absent there may be a rich fauna of delicate water-fleas and fairy-shrimp, some unknown elsewhere in Ireland. These hatch and grow fast, finding safety in the warm fishless waters. Flatworms and snails are also often abundant; these pass the dry periods in springmouths or marshy areas. \n When turloughs retain some water all year, they may be important bird haunts. Rahasane in Galway is famous for its white-fronted geese, whooper swans, wigeon, teal and many waders in winter. Others may not suit the large migratory birds, but their importance to resident warblers and other small birds has never been studied. \n  DRAINING OF TURLOUGHS  \n Turloughs provide good summer grazing for cattle, sheep and horses, partly because of the annual deposition of lime-rich silt. However, for many years, farmers have seen the winter flooding as a waste of potential and they have attempted to find some means of draining the turloughs, so that they can be used all year round. This has usually been achieved by digging an artificial channel through the turlough, which is capable of carrying away any water entering the turlough from surface or groundwater - such channels have often been constructed as part of major arterial drainage schemes. At least a third of the turloughs in Ireland have already been drained and more are being drained each year. This has very serious consequences from the point of view of the environmentalist - the unique flora and fauna of the turlough cannot survive in the absence of seasonal flooding. Even for the farmer, the benefits are not always as great as anticipated - the stopping of the annual limey silt deposition means that the soil may become impoverished and fertilisers must be used. Also, the poorly developed, delicate soil may not be able to withstand the presence of animals through the winter. \n To suggest that no more turloughs should be drained is a rather extreme view but the case for conserving at least some of them is very strong - it would be a great loss if this unique part of our heritage were to disappear for ever. \n  THINGS TO DO  \n If you have a turlough near you, there are plenty of things to observe and record. You can measure the changes in water level over a year by placing a series of measuring sticks in the turlough. When the turlough is filling and emptying, you can locate the springs and swallow holes. \n Notice how the vegetation changes as you move down the slope to the deepest parts - can you relate these changes to the time for which each part is flooded? If you have a soil auger, you can investigate the deposits: you are most likely to find peat or marl on the bottom, and glacial till (with clay and larger stones) on the slopes. Is the changing vegetation related to the type of deposits? \n Does your turlough have a characteristic plankton or other animal forms? How quickly does the animal community develop? Are there fish present and if so, what type? Do birds visit the turlough in the winter? Learn to identify the birds and carry out regular counts through the winter. Does the presence or absence of birds seem to relate to a particular feature, such as the shape    or   size of the turlough, reedy vegetation, or the other animals present?", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "e62e989d-8ef2-4c04-b43c-75d1648b3a8c", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.634170+00:00"}

Children and adults can actively learn from the television by interacting with programmes instead of sitting passively and just watching. \n Parents will see the ease with which children \u00d0 even the youngest \u00d0 can play and learn from the titles using the colourful Roller Controller remote control, specially designed for small hands. \n But it is not just for children. It is now possible to tour the Smithsonian museum, play the world 's greatest golf courses, tour the USA and teach yourself how to take 35mm photos \u00d0 all without moving from your armchair! \n There are four main categories \u00d0 children 's music, games and special interest and currently retail from between <*> pound sign </*> 14.95 and <*> pound sign </*> 39.95. \n The CD-I machine will also play ordinary audio CDs and photo CDs (   it 's   now possible to put your snaps onto a    compact   disc and view them on television). \n As with audio CD-audio, CD-I is a worldwide standard backed by the three largest electronics manufacturers \u00d0 Philips, Sony and Matsushita (Panasonic and Technics) and supported by over 200 other hardware and software companies. \n Similar in look and design to a standard CD-audio player, it is easily connected to any television. The titles are managed with a simple thumbstick controller. \n There are currently around 45 titles available, with four to five new releases scheduled each month. \n The CDI-205 is <*> pound sign </*> 499, including a <*> pound sign </*> 20 software voucher and is available from Gilmores Electrical, Lisburn Road, Belfast. \n\n\n<$B>\n  Now Joe Public is in the picture  \n the new CX6 palm sized camcorder from Mitsubishi is packed with features that are designed to help rather than confuse customers. \n Combining a unique \"foolproof\" operation with technical innovation (including the colour Truefinder which gives a full colour viewfinder with the sharpness until now only seen with monochrome) the CX series is poised to set new standards by including features that produce real customer benefits. \n Launched in time for Christmas (over 250,000 customers will be buying camcorders this year) the CX6 is set to be a winner with both customers and dealers.\n The CX series has been improved as a result of extensive market research into what first time camcorder users want and need from a camera.\n The research looked at the type of situation in which the camcorder owner would be most likely to use the camera. \n They found most buyers are looking for a camcorder that is easy to use, prevents the common mistakes and most important of all, produces really good results. \n Consequently the CX6 has useful features which include: \n <*> bullet point </*> Auto shut off \u00d0 so there should be no more shots of the ground or moving feet if the CX6 is left running accidentally. \n <*> bullet point </*> Different 'event' settings for parties, sunsets, golf, night illuminations, skiing, portraits and sports. These automatically compensate for difficult filming conditions that are present in these situations. \n <*> bullet point </*> The Colour Truefinder which gives the user a viewfinder that combines, for the first time, the sharpness of black and white with full, clearly defined colour. \n <*> bullet point </*> Easily accessible operating buttons. Making it easier for first time users to locate and use the controls. \n <*> bullet point </*> Quick start. The CX series have a recording start time of 0.3 seconds so there is less chance of missing any of the action. \n\n\n<$C>\n  Capturing Christmas  \n CS SUPPLIERS have all the latest exciting electrical goods to give your loved ones this Christmas. \n  \"Obviously at this time of the year there is a lot of interest in camcorders,\" said Raymond Mulholland at the Royal Avenue store.  \"People want to capture their youngsters on film at Christmas.\"  \n The shop 's two main makes are JVC and Canon and cost approximately <*> pound sign </*> 500 to <*> pound sign </*> 600. \n Palmcorders are also gaining popularity and at around <*> pound sign </*> 500 to <*> pound sign </*> 600 the benefit of these is their size. Easier to carry, they are the size of an ordinary still camera. \n Overtaking the midi hi-fi and Mr Mulholland is predicting that sales of these this year will eclipse the midi. \n The most popular buys are Pioneer, Aiwi, JVC and Sharp. Smaller than this again is the micro, at half the size it costs around <*> pound sign </*> 299. \n If you are thinking about satellite this Christmas it is advisable to buy this month rather than leaving it too close to Christmas said Mr Mulholland. Sales are increasing but it is getting harder to get them he said. \n\n\n<$D>\n  Scanner one of the most advanced  \n A new <*> pound sign </*> 500,000 CT Scanner, one of the most advanced in Northern Ireland, has been commissioned at Antrim Hospital. \n It is part of an enlarged radiology department at the hospital, which will welcome its first patients this month. \n For patients, the new department signals the end of transfers to Belfast and Londonderry, for some radiology services. \n While there will continue to be X-ray services available at both the Moyle and Waveney sites, the more involved radiology services, such as CT scanning, will be centred at Antrim. \n This enlarged department at Antrim will be staffed by six radiologists, led by Dr Colin Sinclair, from the Waveney who has also been appointed clinical director for the Radiology Directorate of the United Hospitals Group from April 1 1994. \n Dr Sinclair said:  \"I am delighted that we will be able to provide an enhanced radiological service to all the Northern Board 's residents, especially with the introduction of a CT Scanner. \n \"This is a particularly useful piece of equipment, especially for showing up early signs of conditions such as cancer and lung disease, as well as being beneficial in the examination of those patients involved in traffic accidents where scanning can quickly show up damage to internals organs, particularly the brain and spinal cord.\"  \n The Toshiba CT Scanner was supplied and installed by Medical Imaging (NI) Limited. \n\n\n<$E>\n  A twin track strategy for industrial growth  \n The Engineering Employers Federation represents the interests of <*> pound sign </*> 5,000 companies in all sectors of the UK engineering industry \u00d0 the backbone of the British manufacturing. \n The industry is one of Northern Ireland 's largest exporters and employers. \n The main themes of the EEF 's industrial strategy include: The importance of industry for recovery of the whole economy; the need for improved Government-industry dialogue and mutual understanding; education and training; investment, not only in industry but throughout the economy; and export support. \n The strategy proposals address the three groups responsible for the UK 's industrial future; industry itself, Government, and to the financial institutions. But included messages for all politicians, policy advisers and those involved in education and training at all levels. \n Unemployment is increasing by the day, businesses are closing at an alarming rate and confidence is at an all time low. The UK economy is in immediate trouble because its manufacturing base is too small. That is why there is a balance of trade deficit even while the country is deep in recession, warned the EEF The UK needs a twin-track strategy for economic growth, says director general Neil Johnson. \n The two elements are immediate action to rectify the balance of payments and continuous long term development of technology and industry. \n Engineering and manufacturing form the basis on which everybody 's prosperity depends. Most economic growth, even in service industries, originates in technological innovation from the manufacturing industry. \n To maintain our standards of living we need to revive industrial innovation. To do that we need a vision of what is possible and how it can be achieved \u00d0 an industrial strategy. \n The chief purpose of an industrial strategy is to develop strategic thinking about national industrial affairs. It provides a common background of knowledge and understanding for individual decision makers. Industrial strategy is not about Government intervention, but government does have a crucial role in stimulating and    co-ordinating   strategic thinking. Industrial strategy is an essential counterpart to macroeconomic policy. \n The main items on the EEF 's agenda for an industrial strategy include:\n Encourage internationally mobile investment to locate in and remain in the UK. \n Government to provide effective, timely and internationally competitive export finance, local intelligence in export markets and political support for major projects. \n Extend capital allowances for plant and machinery permanently to 100pc. \n Develop strategic thinking in industry and government. \n Industry to look for organic growth, not just acquisitions. \n Government to take the lead in developing a vision of how industry and technology can be developed to national advantage. \n Industry to provide ideas and information about how industry and technology can be developed to national advantage. \n Shift emphasis from scientific research to technological development. \n Government to maintain continuity of technology support through to full commercial exploitation. \n Central and local government to act as a 'sophisticated and demanding buyer' to develop and stimulate strategic technologies and businesses. \n Pursue the European Fighter Aircraft programme and make a speedy move to production Government to regulate telecommunications, energy and transport industries with a view to technological advance; and to competitiveness of their UK customer and supplier industries. \n Government to assist UK industry to exploit the world market for environmental technology. \n Government to consider the impact on industry of all policy decisions and draft legislation. \n Government to establish effective conduits for industry-government communication, embracing all departments and at all levels. \n Industry to ensure all employees ' performance and development needs are assessed regularly. \n Industry to match world best practice in utilisation of employees ' skills and abilities. \n Industry to increase efforts to show industry 's vital place in society and that it can offer careers that are both rewarding and of social importance. \n\n\n<$F>\n  Women Too build on community need  \n Report by Peter Hutcheon \n The final designs for the new Windsor Women 's Centre in south Belfast were unveiled last week. \n A team of students architects teamed up with local charity Women Too in a unique project aimed at providing the group with plans for a much-needed new home. \n All last week, students attending the European Winterschool for architects at Queen 's University devoted time to the project. \n And the results were revealed during a special ceremony at the group 's current base in Rockview Street, attended by south Belfast MP Martin Smyth. \n  \"Women Too has operated up to now with very few resources, but has managed to do an excellent job,\"  said Mr Smyth. \n  \"To convert its operation to a purpose-built centre can only be a huge boost for this part of south Belfast. \n \"The group has shown that local people are prepared to do a lot of work to improve their area and have shown the way to people in the rest of the city.\"  \n Women Too is a community activated, woman-driven organisation, helping regenerate the Blackstaff ward in inner-city south Belfast. \n  Derelict  \n At its small premises in Rockview Street it provides education and training for women of all ages, creche facilities and an advice centre. \n The new centre will be located at Broadway in the heart of the Blackstaff ward in the Village area, on the site of five derelict houses. \n The <*> pound sign </*> 250,000 development will have five classrooms, a purpose-build computer centre, a creche with an adjoining sleeping room and areas for private advice workshops. \n Joy Poots, joint co-ordinator of Women Too, said they are delighted with the plans and the model for the new centre. \n  \"Because we worked closely with the architects last week we were able to say exactly what our needs were able to come up with feasible designs,\"  she explained. \n  \"The project came about when the Belfast Action Tem was asked to recommend a project for the annual winter school and it suggested us.\"  \n Thursday 's presentation was made by Sheelagh McManus of Matrix and Mary Kelly of Glasgow Housing Co-operatives, who helped to organise the winter school \n  Identified  \n Local architect Susan Crowther was also involved in the planning. She has worked closely with Women Too since last year and will continue to liaise with the members through the building of the new centre. \n Women Too opened Windsor Women 's Centre in 1990, after the Blackstaff Community Health Profile report clearly identified a need for such a facility in the area. \n As a result of the findings the Windsor Steering Group was established, made up of local people, and Women Too was an off-shoot of that committee. The two groups still work closely together. \n Majella McCloskey, who worked on the health profile, believes the new centre can only serve to help the needs of the Village. \n  \"We have worked closely with Women Too since the group started three years ago,\"  she said. \n  \"The area is under threat from many problems such as poor housing, poverty, unemployment and health. \n \"Having a new centre at Broadway in the heart of the community will be a great help.\"  \n The Rockview Street centre is a two-up, two-down house which has become too cramped for the range of services Women Too wants to offer. \n Around 40 women currently use the centre on a regular basis and the creche has to cater for up to 30 children.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "e7062ed3-6401-4afe-8107-7f830f1f23a5", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.635046+00:00"}
{"text": "<Computing>\n\n\n<$A>\n  Magee show BT voice and video link  \n By Karl Gallagher, Northern Ireland manager, Digital \n A new type of telephone line looks set to bring Ulster businesses closer to European and world markets. \n The all-digital lines can carry video, data and voice, all at once. It is now entirely possible to send a file to a customer in Germany, open the file on their computer and discuss its contents across a voice and video link, all from one telephone socket. \n The service is known as ISDN, Integrated Services Digital Network. British Telecom has been supplying ISDN-like telephone links since 1987, but there have been compatibility problems when making calls to other countries. \n All that has been resolved and the new look service, named Euro-ISDN, was demonstrated simultaneously throughout 18 European countries and 50 cities, in December last year. \n Magee College in Derry was chosen as one of the six sites in the UK to show the ISDN phones lines off at the launch. \n Omega Design, a graphic design company based in Derry uses its recently installed ISDN connection to get closer to both its suppliers and its markets. Omega uses reprographics resources and printers in Belfast, and used to send material by courier and train. \n Now it dials the supplier on the ISDN line and delivers and receives artwork instantaneously. From Derry it also inspects and amends work in progress, in Belfast, using desktop conferencing software. \n Omega claims it is now able to tender and compete for work in France and Germany, where even last year they would not have thought it was viable. \n It is looking to servicing existing clients who have offices in Europe, and in the future to use video conferencing to take briefs from clients across the ISDN link. \n There are two types of ISDN line, one for individuals and small companies, known as Basic Rate Access, and one for large corporations, called Primary Rates Access. British Telecom offer the Basic Rate Service as ISDN-30. \n Both are dial-up services. ISDN-2 has two voice and data lines which can support voice, data and image both still and moving; ISDN-30 with 30 voice and data lines can offer refinements on this. \n Transparent to the customer, BT will support both its proprietary ISDN implementation and Euro-ISDN. This is important for doing business with the other countries which have subscribed to the memorandum of understanding agreed between the European PTTs. \n In looking at ISDN, we should also look at the benefits of national and province-wide connection. Many companies have isolated, local 'islands of computing' relying solely upon one of or two PCs. These users would have an intermittent need to access central information. \n Using ISDN, and a product such as Pathworks, from Digital Equipment Corporation, these PCs may be integrated readily with central information bases. \n The benefit is low cost, high performance integration for such users \u00d0 a solution which is impossible by other means. This brings teleworking or working from home much closer. \n Another application which lends itself to an ISDN solution is video surveillance. Organisations using video for security can cost effectively centralise management using ISDN. \n\n\n<$B>\n  CD-ROM\u00c9 The REVOLUTION is just beginning  \n by Lynn Boyd \n A CD-ROM (compact disk read only memory) looks like a standard audio CD but instead of music holds information suitable for computer use. \n The main advantage of such a disk is that is capable of holding a much greater amount of information than the standard floppy disk. \n One CD-ROM can hold the equivalent of 500 3.5 inch floppy disks, 200,000 pages of text, or 72 minutes of video play. \n Such disks can be reproduced very cheaply. Once you have your information encoded on CD-ROM, you can simply take your mastercopy CD to a company which will replicate it for about <*> pound sign </*> 1 per copy for large print-runs. \n Once written, the information on CD-ROM cannot be changed. This makes it excellent for storing large amounts of archival material such as medical records, examination papers for universities and examining boards, or for storing inspection records for industry. \n CD-ROM is the standard format for music but it is also now becoming the standard format for other areas such as the ubiquitous computer game. \n This is because the disk can hold so much information, is cheap to produce and has a longer shelf-life than the equivalent information stored on vinyl. \n Many libraries, including those at Queen 's University, have CD-ROM facilities available, as do a growing number of secondary schools. \n It can be used for multi-media publishing, with interactive programmes using sound, graphics and digitised video animations. \n The information is constructed in such a way as to allow users to carry out text searches easily, requesting further information. \n So how widespread have the uses of this technological innovation become? In 1992 there were some between six and seven million drives in use. \n This year the price has fallen dramatically, so that the average cost of a DC-ROM drive to be used in conjunction with a PC is now around <*> pound sign </*> 200. \n CD-I (Compact Disk-Interactive) is already widely used. The system from which it operates looks like a CD player and hooks up to a TV like a VCR. \n As well as playing normal audio CDs, interactive multimedia CD-I offers high quality images, hi-fi sound and complete interactivity. \n This means children can watch a cartoon, recolour its character and even change the soundtrack and play back their own version. \n The CD-I device will soon become a means of receiving multimedia information and other services, such as interactive games, access to electronic databases, and even home shopping. \n In the foreseeable future you should be able to rent a video without visiting a video rental shop you 'll simply dial it up. \n You will be able to tune into almost any sports event being played anywhere in the world, perhaps even choosing the camera angle and controlling your own instant replays. \n You could have instant success to almost any home shopping catalogue (complete with mini commercials and product demonstrations). \n You might also wish to access information in libraries around the world or from financial services such as banking, investing or insurance. \n CD-ROM is also beginning to play an important role in the world of photography. It is now possible to take slides to a commercial processor, and, for an extra fee, have them put on CD-ROM. \n With the addition of a small box to your TV or home PC you could then access them on screen. It is also possible to produce photos from CD, but the technology is not widely available. \n A more immediately accessible use of CD-ROM can be identified for creative professional such as graphic designers. \n They can now store photographs on disk, which has obvious implications for saving storage space, particularly as this form of archiving is less prone to deterioration than storing film. \n With the arrival of CD recorders at about the same price as an average office photo-copier, it is possible to have a machine that produces CD-ROMs containing thousands of pages of information relevant to your own organisation. \n As the price of CD-ROM drives continues to fall, the day is not far off when every office will have one. This will enable large volumes of reference and archival material to be accessed by other CD-ROM users. \n Among local companies which are currently using CD-ROMs is Textflow Services of Belfast, which is currently archiving QUB examination papers and encoding a publishing firm 's journals into CD-ROM. \n Dr Paul Mackey of Textflow said:  \"If all journals were encoded onto disk in this way, institutions such as libraries could then buy the journal on disk at the end of each year, thereby saving an enormous amount of library space.\"  \n The full technological capabilities of CD-ROM are just beginning to emerge. \n Already CD-ROMs are being used to teach novice computer users the fundamentals of computer hardware and software, with the aid of graphics and animation. \n\n\n<$C>\n  Grasping the essentials  \n By Rodney Waite \n Carrickfergus Enterprise Agency \n Fifteen years ago the workplace was a less demanding place. There was certainly technology and more manpower available than now to get the job done. \n Of course, you had to work hard, the range of skills required by the average employee must have been less than those required by today 's employer. \n Technology had its effect on most activities in the workplace. Computer controlled machines on the shop floor are commonplace but perhaps the largest impact is now being experienced in the office. \n We have now all heard of word processing \u00d0 many more are now familiar with terms such as computerised accounts, payroll, spreadsheets, and desk top publishing. \n These terms may be used in everyday conversation but how many would be happy to apply for a job that now demands even the most basic computer skills or expect you to handle a 'mouse' \u00d0 not for the squeamish! \n Increasingly throughout the country, job descriptions are being changed and updated to include phrases like  \"must be RSA III word processing qualified\"  ,  \"must be computer literate\"  , or  \"must have keyboard skills\"  . \n Many people returning to work are only acquainted with mechanical or at best electric typewriters, the latter of which looked like technology 's leading edge in the old days. \n How do you graduate from the 'steam' equipment to the slick, fast, accurate, versatile machinery in everyday use in business. \n Initially it looks like a difficult transition to make, now \"user friendly training\" (another new term) makes the experience not only useful but enjoyable as well. \n Throughout the province many existing training establishments have, over the past few years, set up new computer training facilities. \n Such is the demand created by employers that new specialised training companies are springing up every day. \n It is also true that some companies claim to train operators with a two day crash course CRASH being the operative word. \n Unless you are already very computer literate the two day courses on offer may not be your cup of tea! Another possibility is to spread the training process, say three-hourly sessions with weekly intervals. Remember, with computers, learning at your own speed is the road to success! \n If you need a computer literacy and information technology course or word processing, spreadsheets, accounts, payroll, or desktop publishing, you should find a good selection of training agencies to choose from in your area. \n It is not uncommon for schools as well as technical colleges to offer adult classes in computer skills. \n There are in most regions, community organisations that can help, and we must not forget the very specialised commercial training agencies. \n Cost of courses can vary and as competition for your custom is keener it pays to shop around. A word of caution, make sure the training instructors are well qualified and recognised examination centres are also available. \n The man who said that  \"in years to come most garden sheds will have an abandoned computer gathering dust\"  is probably right! \n However, as sure as day follows night computers will spread into more and more business activities, and it follows that more and more employers will demand a workforce that is computer literate. \n\n\n<$D>\n Belfast firm in Irish Top Ten \n A Belfast computer company has been named as one of the top ten in Ireland by the Irish Computer magazine. \n Sybex Computing from    Stranmillis  , which has a turnover of around <*> pound sign </*> 4.5 m, was the only Northern Ireland company to be included in the list. \n The magazine noted that last year, Sybex had changed its profile from being a hardware sales organisation to one which specialised in consultancy and software. \n The company 's main emphasis now is on a workflow and document image processing system which Sybex calls BPI, for Business Process Improvement. \n Among recent contracts secured by Sybex were the provisions of systems for the Department of Agriculture, Northern Ireland Electricity and Scottish Power. \n For the Department of Agriculture, the task was to install a computerised office automation system in the Agri-Food Development Service. \n At NIE 's Belfast office, Sybex developed an information system detailed underground electricity cables in the city. \n The system holds a database of 80,000 colour diagrams drawn from notebooks which date back to 1925, and which are constantly being updated. \n Engineers trying to trace a fault can call up the appropriate diagram, produce a colour print which they take with them to the scene, thereby speeding up the restoration of power.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "fb7159d8-1f69-4813-aed8-78d07f67047b", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.636084+00:00"}
{"text": "<Car matters>\n\n\n<$A>\n A helping  hand \n PENTLANDS, Ravenhill Road, Belfast, one of Northern Ireland 's leading Vauxhall dealerships, recognises the indispensable part a car can play in the lives of people with disabilities and their families. \n The dealership specialises in meeting the motoring requirements of disabled people providing expert advice and guidance on how to utilise the Government mobility benefit. \n John Taylor, sales manager at Pentlands, said;  \"Statistics show that of those who receive a Government benefit, some 803,000 people do not use it to acquire transport. A vast number of the UK 's disabled population is therefore missing out on the benefits of Motability.\"  \n He points out that anyone in receipt of the higher mobility component of the Disability Living Allowance (DLA) and the War Pension Mobility Supplement can take advantage of the Motability programme. \n Vehicles acquired through Motability do not have to be driven personally by the recipient of this benefit so the schemes can be used for a child or anyone else unable to drive. \n Pentlands are Motability approved and are also one of the leading Motability dealerships in the Province. Last year, they were awarded second place overall in the UK in the Most Improved Sales of Motability Vehicles category of the motability Awards. \n John Taylor said that there are three acquisitions plans, the most popular of which is contract hire. Under the Vauxhall Motability New Car Contract Hire Scheme, customers exchange their government benefit for a three-year contract which provides a new vehicle and covers all servicing, maintenance and insurance. Dependent on the model chosen, a small one-off payment may be required at the commencement of the contract. \n At present, Pentlands are offering the Corsa Merit diesel and petrol models without a deposit and all Astras come with power steering, engine immobiliser and driver 's airbag as standard. \n Alternatively customers may choose the Vauxhall New Car Motability Hire Purchase Plan and relinquish the benefit over a four or five year period in order to generate a lump sum to finance the purchase of a specially priced car. \n Finally, preferential prices are available through the Vauxhall Mobility Plan, without the need to exchange the Government benefit and the plan can also be used to accommodate people whose DLA award is insufficient to quality for one of the Motability schemes. Lower Rate Mobility Component and Severe Disablement Allowance recipients along with OB holders also qualify for preferential prices through this plan. \n Vauxhall Motors was the first manufacturer to insist that its dealers conformed to a code of conduct aimed at improving service to all Vauxhall Motability customers. \n Pentlands has three fully trained Motability sales consultants - Kathy Murphy, Mike Adair, and Dougie Johnston - and the showroom is fully accessible with wheelchair ramps. \n John Taylor said:  \"We can also arrange for a sales consultant to go to your home if you are unable to travel to our showrooms.\"  \n Pentlands will organise any conversions or adaptations that are required and when the car is delivered ensure that all the necessary checks have been made and oversee all subsequent servicing arrangements. \n The showroom is open from 9am to 8.30pm Monday to Thursday, Friday 9am to 5pm and Saturday 9am to 12.30pm. Why not call Pentlands today at 01232 451422? \n\n\n<$B>\n Tip top ragtop \n AUDI has unveiled a new design study, the Audi TTs Toadster at the Tokyo Motorshow, a variation on the Audi TT Coupe theme that stole the show at the IAA in Frankfurt in September. The Audio TTS is based on the Audi TT's quattro running gear. \n The Audi TTS is the work of the same young team of designers and engineers that developed the Audi TT. \n The character of the Audi TTS is based on a principle of reduction. Every detail, both visual and technical has been scrutinised to eliminate the unnecessary and create an effect of substance and maturity. \n This is emphasised by the use of aluminium and the design of handles, mirrors and interior equipment. \n The engine is a 1.8 litre turbocharged unit with five valves per cylinder developing 210 bhp. \n This gives the Audi TTS a projected top speed in the region of 150mph with 0-62mph taking about six seconds. \n The TTS returns an average of below 31.4mpg. \n\n\n<$C>\n <&French> Pour votre  voiture  </&French> \n OUR family business JC Halliday and Sons, has an excellent reputation, well earned by the professional and assiduous attention we pay to the needs of our customers. \n Principal Lex Halliday says:  \"In 25 years as a Citroen dealer, making us the oldest in the Province, we have had countless customers who have been delighted with the quality and performance of the product. \n \"We specialise in business sales which means that our sales team, headed by sales manager William Gregg, is very familiar with the requirements of the commercial world. \n \"Of course, customers buying for personal use will be given equal attention in order to help them decide on a model which best suits their lifestyle and pocket. Talking of which, don't forget that we are also up to date with the funding options and tailor-made finance packages currently available.\"  \n The after-sales service and facilities at JC Halliday and Sons are second to none. John Jamison, service manager, knows that you need skilled, expert workmanship to keep your vehicle at its peak performance and has total familiarity with all the vehicles in the Citroen range. \n Our comprehensive servicing programme includes diagnostic tuning. Computerised stock control ensures the smooth running of our workshop, and parts manager Alan Greer can offer a speedy resolution to your problems. \n > For your convenience, courtesy cars and service loan cars are also available.

Plus there 's a choice of what to do with your car at the end of the agreed two or three-year period. Ask us for full details. \n\n\n<$D>\n Don't take  our  word \n THE Proton pedigree is very much in evidence throughout the Mpi range - whichever you choose, you 're assured of a smooth, reliable and extremely economical drive. \n Don't just take our word for it, though. \n Independently the MP has won numerous awards for quality and value for money including five IBCAM Gold Medals for interior and exterior build quality at three consecutive British International Motor Shows. The BBC Top Gear Magazine's K-Reg Survey elected Proton third, Best Marque for customer satisfaction, leaving 27 other popular marques in its wake. \n A major contribution to this fact is that the MPi comes complete with one of the most outstanding warranty packages around. The Proton Customer Commitment Package includes six year mechanical and bodywork guarantees and a full three-year total vehicle warranty. \n Now what about safety? Don't worry, you 're in a Proton. Which means you 're well and truly protected by a rigid passenger shell, energy-absorbing bumpers, anti-burst locks, a collapsible steering column and bodyshell crumple zones. \n Safe for the environment too. A three-way catalytic with multi-point fuel injection, standard on all models sees to that. \n At Proton we like to believe we 've thought of everything. Even as far as how we can protect your investment after it has left our showrooms, because that can make a big difference to the lasting quality and value of the marque. \n\n\n<$E>\n He  likes  it \n  YOU 'VE seen the annual Ulster motor show, now see the one that runs all year round - that 's the message from Peter Gordon of Charles Hurst Group. \n New cars at Hurst 's include the Renault Megane - read the great review here from Stephen Sutcliffe of Autocar magazine - the Nissan Almera and the Citroen Saxo. \n Not to mention the rover 200 series, which according to Hurst 's Gavin Martin is the most successful Rover ever. \n And the Almera isn't far behind - according to Richard Sholdis of Hurst's Nassa division, it's fitting nicely into the gap left by its predecessor, the Sunny. \n  \"The Sunny represented over 40 per cent of our sales every year, and it won't be long before the Almera reaches the same level,\"  he said. \n  \"Everything about it is state of the art, and there 's a superb mix of options available from the Equation at <*> pound sign </*> 12,600 SLX. \n \"In the middle of the range, for example, you can either choose between the SI with sports seats and CD player for the younger driver, or the GX with standard seats and radio cassette.\"  \n YOU'RE going to like the Renault Megane. As a car to drive and own, not as a concept to grasp and croon about. \n The Megane, pronounced Meg-aaan, is unarguably the best car in its class alongside the Peugeot 306. \n The five-door hatchback, which will account for 70-80 per    cent   of sales before the other mainstream models appear, is a masterpiece of packaging. \n At the very least the Megane competes head on with the best in class in these areas; the old 19 categorically did not. \n And from a pure design andergonomic angle, I'd say it sets new standards inside with a brilliant basic driving position, excellent seats, handsome instruments, fresh and exciting shapes around most of the console, and deeply considered ergonomics. \n It 's the sort of interior you climb into and find the controls naturally, immediately, without searching for them. \n It 's as least as user friendly as a Fiat Coupe and only a little way short of the Calibra, still the most practical Coupe there is. \n If Renault UK 's estimates that the hatch will cost little more than its 19 equivalent and that the coupe 'will be very competitive' become reality, we could be looking at a new champ. \n\n\n<$F>\n Rover is top dog \n GAVIN Martin, the sales manager of Charles Hurst 's Rover division, has no doubt about where the new Rover 200 series stands - at the top. \n  \"It 's the most successful Rover launched yet,\"  he said in the firm 's Boucher Road showroom in Belfast yesterday. \n \"We 're selling more than we can get hold of, and we 're finding that it 's attracting not only loyal Rover fans, but drivers who had always bought Toyota and Vauxhall before. \n \"I 'd say sales of the 200 represent half of all our rover sales at the moment.\"  \n Prices for the series range from <*> pound sign </*> 10,600 for the 214i three-door to <*> pound sign </*> 14,500 for the top of the range 216Sli, with two diesels on offer. \n And in March or early April Hursts will have their hands on the 200 series sports version, the VVC. Rover 's keeping this one carefully under wraps, with no price or performance figures yet available. \n The Rover 400 series four-door saloon, meanwhile, has also been selling very well since its launch last year. \n The 400 and 200 marked the completion of a range of cars which play a key role in strengthening Rover 's presence in the medium sector of the market. \n The five-door version of the new Rover 400 has already been recognised for bringing outstanding levels of driving environment, ride comfort, handling and prestige into the medium sector. \n However, it is the new saloon that represents the 400 Series in its definitive form. Sales are predicted to split 50:50 between the two body styles. \n The four-door configuration allows the most complete execution of the elegant 400 design. A rounded and distinctive style at the rear establishes an even more powerful road presence than the five-door and reflects the strengths of Rover 's traditional styling heritage. The large boot, opening down to bumper level, provides easy access and an impressive storage space of 17 cubic feet. \n The new rover 400 Series saloon is available in 1.6 and 2.0 litre petrol and 2.0 litre diesel forms with prices ranging from <*> pound sign </*> 13,695 for the 416i to <*> pound sign </*> 17.195 for the fully specified, high performance 420SDi.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f3acf1f3-2b5e-4257-99f1-7e74df75be84", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.637086+00:00"}
{"text": "<Technology matters 2>\n\n\n<$A>\n Internetworking the future \n Last year 's big computer story was undoubtedly the launch of Microsoft 's Windows 95 - with Microsoft spending around <*> dollar sign </*> 1 billion on the biggest launch in the history of the computer industry including buying a Rolling Stones song and entire daily issue of the Times. \n Big as the publicity was for Windows 95, however, the computer phenomena that continued to dominate the computer columns in the national press and specialist magazines was the Internet. \n Everyone, it seems, is finding a use for this incredible worldwide network of thousand of computers which gives access to the most bewildering array of information on, seemingly, every subject human beings have ever imagined. But aside from all the trivia (and the more sinister political and pornographic content) the big development is that the Internet is fast becoming a tool for doing business. Major corporations, small enterprises, local and central government bodies, and community groups are all urgently asking how they can use the Internet, and getting the World Wide Web sites up and running. \n A recent UK survey of more than 2000 organisations shows that more than 36t per cent are using the Internet in some way and another 15 per cent are actively evaluating it. Estimates vary in the amount of business that is being done via the Internet at present, but analysts agree that it will be a major vehicle for trading by the turn of the millennium, with some estimates putting the figure at more than <*> dollar sign </*> 200 bn a year by then. \n For now, many companies are just waking up to the possibilities and are putting their toe in the water. This usually consists of getting a World Wide Web site up and giving an \"address\" where Internet users the world over can visit electronically, to browse the material presented. Such a site is a means of promotions, to let the world know about our products and services. \n The other main use that companies get from using the Internet is electronic mail. For the price of a brief local telephone call, users can send lengthy messages all round the world. The benefits are clear, even aside from the cost of benefits (E-mail is cheaper than both telephone calls and faxes - no more \"telephone tag\", where you and your business colleague keep missing each other, and a stored record of all your communication for future reference. \n These would be reason enough for most businesses to consider getting on-line. But many businesses are keen to exploit the potential for world-wide trade via the information superhighway. The World Wide Web is full of organisations selling just about every conceivable type of goods - when you visit such a site, you can browse through catalogues of goods, complete with descriptions, pictures and pricing information. Ordering can be done electronically, although the most obvious means of payment - by credit card - currently still presents problems. Sending your credit card details through the Internet is still definitely not to be recommended - software hackers have the capability of intercepting details and using them fraudulently. \n Large organisations with multiple sites with requirements for electronic mail and electronic document delivery can get obvious benefits from the information superhighway. But even small firms can begin to realise benefits. A small travel firm called Mountain Travel-Sobek, which specialises in exotic adventure travel has recently begun to use the Internet. People browsing the World Wide Web who come across their site regularly sign up for holidays on the spot. In addition, they believe that they can save thousands on the printing of their elaborate and expensive annual colour catalogue by publishing an electronic version. \n Many top international management consultants believe the Internet will be indispensable for doing business by the end of the decade. As business becomes more niche market-orientated and more global and as more and more businesses and people get on-line, it will make having access to the information superhighway and a World Wide Web presence a necessity for business survival - rather like telephones and fax machines have become. Now 's the time to tip your toe in the water and find out how your business can benefit. \n\n\n<$B>\n Making the breakthrough \n The technological changes taking place in the telecom industry are so rapid and imaginative that the business community can very often feel confused. \n Yet for Northern Ireland companies located on the periphery of the UK which is in turn at the outward limit of the European Union, access to the best communications systems is essential for competitiveness. \n In a global market the sharpest competitive edge comes from information and the ability to transfer information between customers and suppliers. We are beginning to see the convergence of IT, and telecommunications is opening up huge opportunities both for the operators and customers that they serve. \n But what are these opportunities? For a start corporations are increasingly on the look-out for innovative ways of doing business. Telecommunications has helped to fulfil this need by delivering real business gains at a strategic level. \n This sounds obvious to us now, but only a few years ago the saving in telecoms were regarded as those which a company might lop off its annual telephone bill. Now we can communicate face to face via videoconferencing, or instantly exchange all types of information with suppliers, customers and colleagues through a single electronic mail system. We have voice networks that offer incredible flexibility, and a local cost call can open up the Internet. To further stimulate change operators must understand the changing needs of their customers. At Mercury, the new structure that we are building is allowing us to focus more clearly in these markets. Only through genuine appreciation of the business pressures in other markets will we be able to offer the kind of bespoke solutions that the customers need. \n Marrying the worlds of commerce and telecommunications is the name of our game. We are moving towards true integration which allows us to break free from the traditional boundaries which have constrained commerce for so long. \n\n\n<$C>\n From Maghera to worldwide \n A company that was established to supply a small customer in its home town in Maghera, County Londonderry has grown to become a major player in the United Kingdom, European and Middle Eastern markets. \n Almost 26 years on Cunningham Covers now manufacture and supplies a wide range of products that have in some way or other stemmed from its core business of manufacturing trailer covers for the transport industry. \n In addition to tension curtains and tarpaulins, the products range now on offer includes marquees, load securing systems, bouncy castles, pool liners, animal lifting harnesses and horse water jumps. \n The owner of the company, and force behind its growth is Gordon Cunningham. \n With all the characteristics of a successful entrepreneur, he is an ideas man, who finds it hard to take no for an answer when it comes to finding a solution to a problem, and will rarely say  'sorry, we can't do that'  to a customer. \n So dedicated is he to exporting that he keeps a clock in his office set at Middle Eastern time, in case he should need to talk to a customer. \n  \"We pride ourselves on being able to provide solutions that no one else can offer. \n \"That is perhaps why we are now able to offer such a range of products,\"  explained Gordon. \n This expertise has been called upon a number of occasions, most recently to help with the fit out on the luxury cruise liner the Sea Princess. \n But despite such a wide and varied product range Gordon points out that the company has never produced anything that it could not sell. \n  \"This is where our investment in the latest design technology has paid off for us. He is careful   to   stress that the large product range on offer at    the company has not been to the detriment of high quality. \n  \"The very nature of our business demands that our products and solutions must be of the highest quality or lives could be put at risk. \n \"Therefore quality and high standards are at the forefront of every product we produce.\"  \n The company is also very particular that it will deliver its product when it said it would. \n\n\n<$C>\n Showing you can't judge by size \n An Antrim company is proof if proof is needed that size isn't everything when it comes to exporting, and small companies can sell their products successfully across the world. \n Fast Engineering was established in 1981 by Seamus Connolly, a chartered civil engineer, to provide a more workable solution to the problem of water storage on engineering sites. \n The company produces collapsible yet portable liquid storage tanks used by relief agencies of emergency water provision and by the oil industry and fire service for environmental protection. \n It has successfully identified and exploited a nice-market on a world-wide basis. \n  \"It is important for a small company to hit the ground running, and we were very fortunate that we got endorsement from Oxfam for our tanks at an early stage,\"  said Seamus. \n With the support of LEDU, the company began to produce a range of portable liquid storage tanks which because of their simple design and ease of carriage were soon in big demand from the major relief agencies working in disaster areas around the world. \n  \"Our Fasttank provides a flexible solution to the permanent or temporary containment of liquids. It is strong yet lightweight and when folded is compact enough to be easily transported to event the most remote locations worldwide,\"  explained Seamus. \n The company 's next big break came when it was approached by BP to provide them with a tank. \n  \"They were so delighted with the result that they are now one of our major customers.\"  \n\n\n<$C>\n Burning at both ends \n Few companies can say that they are market leaders at opposite ends of the spectrum within a highly competitive international marketplace. \n Bangor-based Denroy Plastics is a company that has successfully achieved this accolade through the manufacture of a wide range of plastic products for both industrial and domestic markets. \n A wholly-owned subsidiary of the Denroy Group, it was established in 1972 following the amalgamation of Ulster Plastics and Martin Rainey. \n Employing 250 staff at two sites in Bangor, the company is divided into two main divisions:\n Denroy Consumer Products which    manufactures   and markets the world famous Denman range of hair-care products. \n Denroy Plastics, Industrial Moulding, which offers a wide range of comprehensive injection and compression moulding services to industry. \n The past 12 months have been exceptional for the company. Sales of the Denman range of hair care products have continued to increase, but the highlight of the year has been the performance of the industrial division. \n Sales increased by 54 per cent on 1994 figures contributing half of total group sales. \n Ron Wilson, the newly appointed general manager of the division says that both divisions are now neck and neck when it comes to contributing to total group turnover. \n  \"This is a massive boost for the industrial side which has been growing year on year to catch up with the success of the consumer division.\"  \n Over the last two years the industrial moulding division has undergone significant investment which has included a <*> pound sign </*> 1 million re-equipment programme which meant the purchase of state-of-the-art design and manufacturing facilities and a fully integrated computer system. \n  \"Our success has enabled us to stand on   our   own    two   feet and go for further growth,\"  explained Ron. \n Ron said that because of the success of the consumer division, the industrial end was probably not given as much management attention in terms of growth plans until recently. \n  \"Our performance over the last number of years has shown that we are a world leader in our own right and we now have a dedicated management team to take us into the future.\"  \n Growth will be in expanding outside Northern Ireland into Eire and the rest of the United Kingdom and worldwide markets.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "60635a6b-9815-461f-ac10-9e4d4488c200", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.638439+00:00"}
{"text": "<Technology matters 3>\n\n\n<$A>\n GREEN RESEARCH \n By  Jim Swindall  \n The recent sinking of the  Braer  off the Shetlands Islands has once again focused public attention on the impact of modern society, in particular industrial activity, upon our environment. This is the most recent stage in a process of increased awareness over the past decade. The growth in public concern has resulted in new environment legislation at national and European level that has had a profound effect upon industry and commerce. \n One has only to look at the supermarket shelves to see the vast range of products that claim to be environmentally friendly. Even some family cars now claim to be recyclable as well as being energy-efficient. These changes came about as a direct result of industry and commerce seeing marketing advantage in selling products that claim to be 'green'. \n Changes are also occurring in the manufacturing process where companies are taking steps to minimise their effluent and waste. \n The increase in environmental consciousness in industry has given a boost to fundamental environmental research which underpins the practical solutions required to reduce the environmental impact of industrial operations. New effluent treatment systems are being developed, and there is an increasing emphasis on clean technology, ie changing the manufacturing process to eliminate a polluting by-product or to produce an innocuous waste which can be recycled. \n   Solutions   \n Much work needs to be carried out in the economics and social science areas to determine if proposed solutions do indeed lead to real environmental gain. For example, it takes 200 times more water and far more energy to make a paper cup than a polystyrene cup. Yet it is accepted wisdom that the paper cup is environmentally more sound. Another example is the belief that gas is a better fuel than coal because it produces less carbon dioxide which acts as a greenhouse gas. In reality the use of gas inevitably leads to leaks to the atmosphere and, as natural gas is a 20 times stronger greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, the answer to the question 'Which is the best fuel?' is not nearly so clear cut. \n The QUESTOR Centre at Queen 's, which was founded in 1989, was the first environmental IUCRC outside the USA. The International Fund for Ireland adopted the NSF role of providing the pump-priming funding for the first five years of operation. This amounted to <*> pound sign </*> 745,000, and a similar sum has been obtained from the 16 industry members of the Centre. \n The members ' subscriptions and the IFI contribution are used to fund fundamental research projects which are industrially relevant. The industry members help to select the projects submitted by University staff and also give valuable input at the six-monthly meetings of the Centre on practical aspects of the research. The existence of the Centre has led to other funding being brought into the University \u00d0 to date <*> pound sign </*> 470,000 in research grants and <*> pound sign </*> 660,000 in EC STRIDE funding. It is confidently expected that more will follow. Increased contacts between the University and the Centre members has also been a positive outcome of the establishment of the Centre. \n   Links   \n International links have been established, especially with the Hazardous Substance Management Research Centre in New Jersey, but also with a French centre set up in 1990 and embryo centres in Canada and Russia. These links have proved most valuable, helping to avoid duplication of research effort and allowing new centres to learn from the experience of those established earlier. \n When the QUESTOR Centre central laboratory was formally opened by David Bellamy on 24 October 1980 he said that it was 'a bright light at the end of a very dark tunnel'. Perhaps this was a bit of Bellamy overstatement but it is significant that, as a result of the existence of the QUESTOR Centre, industrially relevant environmental research costing over <*> pound sign </*> 3.5m has been funded at Queen 's to date for the period 1989 \u00d0 1994. \n (Jim Swindall is Director of the QUESTOR Centre at Queen 's) \n\n\n<$B>\n  GARDENING   diary  \n  Turn on to compost  \n Do you throw away soil fertility with the household rubbish in the weekly bin-lift or do you make garden compost. \n I don't mean do you deposit your grass and hedge clippings in a pile in some out-of-the-way corner. No, I mean do you actually produce compost? \n Unless you are in the happy situation of having easy access to quantities of farm animal manure, there is no better and cheaper way of having a ready supply of soil-enriching material than turning garden and kitchen waste into compost. \n There are many ways of making a compost \"bin\", the idea being to contain and keep tidy the compost materials and to speed up decomposition by aeration and retention of moisture. \n One of the simplest methods of construction is to erect a square cage of netting wire, supported at the corners by stout posts driven into the ground. \n Thick perforated plastic sheets e.g. cut out of large bags, can also be used for the sides of the \"bin\", stretched between the corner uprights. A more solid structure can be made of timber planks of suitable dimensions and built up and fitted together in a slatted fashion to allow spaces for ventilation e.g. boards 100cms (40ins) <*> multiplication sign </*> 12cms (5ins) x 2cms (3/4 ins). \n The use of bricks or breeze-blocks will make for an even more permanent structure if that is    desirable   A height of about 1 1/4 metres (four feet) is convenient. \n There are also many proprietary compost bins available, some with sliding sides to allow the compost to be shovelled out, others with devices to allow for tumbling to mix the ingredients. \n The aim in compost making is to provide conditions which will enable decomposition to proceed as rapidly as possible. Materials should be well mixed. \n Don't allow large quantities of one material, e.g. grass mowings or hedge clippings, to build up in one thick layer. This can slow up the heating process, as such layers can either become dank pancakes or open sandwiches. Put large quantities of such materials aside and add gradually to the heap, small amounts at a time. \n The process of good compost-making generates a high temperature in the early stages - a few inches down from the top it may even be uncomfortably warm to the touch. \n There is a host of materials which can be used \u00d0 weeds, leaves, soft clippings, dead flowerheads, vegetable plot refuse, greenhouse refuse, potato vegetable and fruit peelings, tea-leaves, egg shells, shredded newspapers and spent potting compost. \n Materials to avoid include woody material, vegetation, e.g. grass, which has been sprayed with hormone weed killer, persistent perennial weeds such as scutch grass and convolvulus, animal weeds which are in seed and are prolific in seed-shedding, and diseased and pest-ridden vegetation. \n Additional nitrogen will speed-up the rotting-down process, encouraging the build-up of the micro-organisms, fungi and bacteria, which are associated with the breakdown of vegetable matter. \n Farm manure is a splendid activator, added in layers as the heap is build up. Soil from a completed compost heap will do as a substitute. Sulphate of ammonia is also excellent, added at the rate of 1/2 oz per square metre over the surface, every 15 to 25cms (six to ten inches) layer. Or a proprietary compost activator may be used. \n The dressing of sulphate of ammonia may be alternated with a dressing of lime at 3 to 4oz to counteract the acidity of the fertilizer. Don't add either of these materials directly onto farm manure, otherwise valuable nitrogen may be lost. \n It is best to keep the top of the heap covered with an old piece of carpet, sacking or thick polythene \u00d0 water can be applied if the heap shows a    tendency   to dry out. \n When the heap has reached its desired height, top off with an inch or two of soil. \n Composting is a more rapid process in spring and summer. Try to have three compost heaps at various stages. \n To turn all that miscellaneous material into a brown crumbly friable sweet-smelling soil in a matter of months \u00d0 it 's magic! \n\n\n<$C>\n Test drive \u00d0 the Nissan Sunny SR \n  A car you 'll warm to \u00c9  \n  Nissan might not be the marque that springs to mind when it comes to performance hatchbacks, but look out for the nifty little Sunny SR.  \n It 's one of that new breed of cars \u00d0 the 'warm hatchback'. Put simply, cars like this, the Citroen ZX Furio and others, are a way of giving customers 'hot hatch' style performance without the insurance penalties. \n It 's part of a huge array of Sunny models: hatches, saloons, estates, and even a costly GtiR version which is ready for rallying. \n The SR, which comes in three-door hatchback form, is a sort of under-stated Gti. From the outside, it has a few of the Gti dressings like upgraded wheel trims, spoilers at the front and rear and so on. \n It costs <*> pound sign </*> 11,230 here, which places it well below most so-called fully fledged Gti cars. \n For that price, as I 've said, you get a sporty looking car but, unlike the Clio at least, it comes with a fair amount of space, both for passengers inside, where it 's particularly roomy, and in the boot. \n Equipment, as it tends to do on most Nissans, runs to a high standard. The SR comes complete with power steering, electric windows, mirrors and sunroof, remote control boot release and 'plip' central locking with a built-in alarm system; one which takes a bit of getting used to, in fact. \n But what of the car 's performance capabilities? In short, they 're very impressive. \n While the range-topping Gti Sunny uses a 2.0 litre power unit, the SR employs a 1.6 litre 16-valve engine. Working through a crisp five-speed gearbox, that gives the hatchback a claimed top speed of 121 mph and a 0-60 mph rating of 11.2 seconds. \n In effect, the car uses its 102 bhp very well indeed. You don't need to pump up the revs to get it to move swiftly and smoothly up through the gears, and it isn't a noisy performer by any stretch of the imagination. \n It 's a very good cruiser, too, moving along effortlessly at motorway limit speeds and above. \n What impresses more about this Nissan is its handling ability. \n Unlike some hatchbacks one could mention, this seems to be solidly built with a first-class chassis. It has a reassuring wide stance on the road. \n All of that gives it a very encouraging sure-footedness once you try to throw it around a corner or two. \n The suspension is the same as that used in the Sunny Gti, which makes it firm without being too hard. On the stopping front, there are no ABS brakes, but the ventilated discs at the front seemed capable enough in my spell with the Nissan. \n So what you get with this package is a roomy hatchback with plenty of power on tap, great fun to drive, and better than average handling abilities. \n\n\n<$D>\n  News from Vauxhall  \n  VAUXHALL has been giving more details of changes and additions to its range for the 1994 sales year.  \n Last week, it was news of the Astra, Cavalier and Calibra.

{"text": "<Sewage treatment>\n\n\n<$A>\n SEWAGE TREATMENT \n  At the outset it is important to clarify two terms, sewerage and sewage, because they are often used incorrectly. Sewerage is a system of pipes used to collect and carry sewage which is the wastewater discharged from domestic premises. Domestic sewage consists of human wastes, paper, vegetable matter. This type of waste is organic because it consists of compounds of carbon and can be broken down by microorganisms into simpler compounds which are stable and not liable to cause a nuisance. Sewage can consists of 99 <*> per cent sign </*> water and 0.1 <*> per cent sign </*> solids.  \n Besides domestic sewage there is industrial waste. Many industrial wastes are also organic in composition and can be treated by microorganisms in the same way as domestic sewage. This type of treatment is called biological treatment and the strength of the sewage is measured in terms of B.O.D. or biochemical oxygen demand. This is a measure of the amount of oxygen used by the microorganisms in breaking down the sewage into stable compounds. \n Thus in a town the sewerage system will collect the sewage from domestic, commercial, and industrial premises and carry it to the nearest river or to the sea. The dilutions available in the receiving water has traditionally determined the extent of treatment necessary. \n SEWAGE TREATMENT PROCESSES \n In modern treatment works sewage goes through several stages of treatment.  Preliminary treatment  to deal with large solids which are removed by screening or ore macerated and returned to the sewage flow. At this stage grit is removed in special tanks. The sewage then receives  primary treatment  which consists in allowing the sewage into sedimentation tanks where solids settle out in the form of sludge. The next stage is  secondary treatment  or biological treatment in which microorganisms are used to take organic matter out of solution so as to form a sludge which can be settled out in a final settling tank.  Tertiary  treatment can reduce the organic matter content still further if this is necessary.  Nutrient  removal consists of reducing the phosphorus and nitrogen in the sewage so as to prevent plant growth in the receiving waters. \n HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF SEWAGE TREATMENT \n Early attempts at treating sewage in the U.K. consisted in acquiring large farms and spreading the sewage over the land where it decayed under the action of microorganisms. It was soon found that the land became 'sick' and that it was necessary to treat the sewage. At first this was done by settling the sewage in concrete tanks in which the solid sewage settled out and was removed for further treatment. The partially clarified liquid sewage was then passed on to the land. Subsequently, chemicals such as lime were added to the settling tanks to increase the amount of solids being settled out. \n A Royal Commission report of 1912 set a standard for the quality of treated sewage effluent before it could be discharged to rivers. The standard set was that the BOD should not exceed 20mg/1 and that the suspended solids should not exceed 30mg/1. These figures were recommended as a general standard and were related to situations where the receiving waters would dilute the treated effluent 8 times. The standards were designed so that the BOD in the receiving waters would not exceed 4 mg/1 and thus fish could survive. The limitation on suspended solids was to ensure that banks of sludge would not build up on the bed of the receiving waters. \n BIOLOGICAL FILTERS \n The sedimentation treatment described above even when aided by chemical treatment could not reach these standards. Thus a second stage or secondary treatment was required. At first secondary treatment consisted of treating the sewage on percolating filters. These consisted of circular beds of stone about 1m deep over which the settled sewage was distributed by sets of rotating pipes which sprinkled the sewage over the stones. Gradually a slime build up on the surface of the stones which absorbed dissolved material out of the settled sewage through microbial action and reduced the BOD of the effluent to 20mg/1. As the slime built up on the stone it sheared off particularly in the spring. It was necessary to trap this slime by passing the effluent from the filters through a second set of settling tanks. The effluent after this secondary treatment and settlement would in general meet the required standard of 20 mg/1 for BOD and 30 mg/1 for suspended solids. \n ACTIVATED SLUDGE \n In 1914 a different type of secondary treatment was developed. It was found by that continually aerating the effluent from the settlement tanks flocs of sludge would be formed and that they would absorb the dissolved organic matter out of the sewage in the same way as happens in the percolating filter. Over the years different forms of aeration developed. The retention period in these tanks was generally 8 hours and this became the conventional period for activated sludge systems. The sludge from conventional activated sludge was unstable and required further treatment by digestion which will be described later. \n Quite a number of plants with percolating filters were build in towns throughout Ireland, one of the earliest being built in Tipperary town. However, the activated sludge plants were constructed because the system needed more precise control and was more suitable for a large population. \n EXTENDED AERATION \n In 1960 a system activated sludge based on a long period of aeration 24-36 hours was developed in Holland. Aeration was carried out in a continuous ditch known as an Oxidation Ditch. The method of aeration is by a horizontal shaft to which are attached a series of short paddles which dip into the sewage in the ditch. On rotating the shaft the sewage is aerated and propelled around the ditch. The aerated sewage is formed into a brown floc like sludge which settles out in a separate settling tank. Thus clear treated effluent is drawn off the bottom of the tank. The advantage of this system is that the sludge is stable and needs no further treatment except dewatering. The disadvantage is that the power absorbed is high because of the long period of aerationg, thus the system is suitable for small plants of less than say 20,000 population. \n Subsequently a similar system of extended aeration using square tanks and vertical shaft aerations have been developed. These take up less space than the oxidation ditch but being deeper may be disadvantageous in bad ground conditions. \n Since 1970 treatment plants in Ireland have been based on the extended aeration system whereas prior to that they were generally based on sedimentation and biological filtration. Treatment stages typical plants are shown in figs. 1 and 2. \n It will be noted that preliminary treatment consisting of screening and grit removal are included in both systems but that in the modern plant these are mechanised. \n When plants serve populations greater than 20,000 population it is usual to reduce power costs by providing sedimentation (primary treatment) and biological (secondary treatment). \n TERTIARY TREATMENT \n If the flow in the receiving water is less than eight times the quantity of effluent then a third stage of treatment is necessary. This is known as tertiary treatment and is aimed at reducing the BOD to 10 mg/1 and the suspended solids to 10 mg/1. Several forms of tertiary treatment are available for example:\n (1) Passing the effluent over grass plots (2) Retaining the effluent in lagoons (3) Filtering through sand beds (4) Using a bed of pebbles or wedge wire in the final settling tanks. \n There are a few small plants in Ireland which have tertiary treatment (using the grass plot or pebble bed / wedge wire system). \n NUTRIENT REMOVAL \n In addition to reducing the BOD and suspended solids consideration must nowadays be given to reducing the amount of phosphorus and nitrogen in effluents. These elements act as nutrients or fertilizers and when the effluent is discharged into a lake the phosphorus   is   discharged with the effluent. This is done by adding aluminium or ferric salts to the treatment process. This has the effect of causing the phosphorus to settle out of the effluent and into the sludge. There are a few plants in Ireland where phosphorus removal is used, notably in Killarney, Mullingar and Castleblaney. \nWhere the effluent is discharged into the sea it may be necessary to reduce the nitrate content by a process of denitrification which will reduce the nitrate content to 10 mg/1. So far it hasn't been necessary to use denitrification in Ireland. \n SLUDGE TREATMENT \n The sludge from extended aeration plants is rendered stable by the treatment process and can be dewatered by passing it through a filter belt press thus thickening the sludge from 1 <*> per cent sign </*> solids to 15 or 20 <*> per cent sign </*> solids. The sludge can then be mixed with domestic refuse on a tiphead. The sludge from primary settling tanks is unstable and needs further treatment by digestion in closed tanks. This is known as anaerobic sludge digestion and can be carried out in unheated tanks or in heated tanks. When the tanks are heated the methane gas which is formed can in turn be used to fuel burners which keeps the tanks heated. \n Another form of sludge treatment is composting. This consists of mixing the sludge with straw of lime and cement kiln dust. The sludge will heat up and kill    off   microorganisms. This system has been used in the USA and on the continent and and has recently been introduced into the North of Ireland. \n The final disposal of sewage sludge can be by a number of routes\n (1) Disposal on agricultural land (2) Co-disposal with domestic refuse on a landfill site (3) Disposal in the sea (4) Incineration \n The disposal of sludge to agricultural land is controlled by EC directive No. 86/278/EEC. This requires that the sludge, unless it is injected or ploughed immediately into the soil, must undergo biological, chemical or heat treatment, long term storage on any other appropriate process. \n The object of this treatment is to kill off disease causing organisms which may be in the sludge. These restrictions are difficult to meet in the case of small plants and the amount of sludge used in agriculture has declined in favour of co-disposal with domestic refuse in landfill sites. \n Disposal of sludge at sea is only practised in the case of Dublin and it has been decided to phase this out. \n Incineration is only suitable for large populations and the system is not used in Ireland. \n Earlier incinerators proved very expensive to operate and for this reason many of the plants built in other countries have been abandoned. In more recent years a new form of incinerator has been developed based on the use of a fluidised bed which it proving more successful. \n SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE TREATMENT FACILITIES IN IRELAND \n At present approximately 66 <*> per cent sign </*> of the population live in towns and are connected to sewers. The remainder live in rural areas, and it is impractical to connect them to sewers. These houses are served by septic tanks. \n The number and capacity of the sewage treatment plants in the Republic of Ireland are shown in Table 1. \n Most Irishtowns are located around the coast, and by far the largest of these is Dublin, with 920,000 inhabitants. The sewage from 600,000 of these receives primary treatment and there are two sea outfalls which serve 260,000 and 60,000 people. \n 47 other towns around the coast discharge untreated sewage to estuaries or coastal waters, and only 11 coastal towns have primary or secondary treatment. There are 68 towns which discharge to inland waters. These are towns between 1,000 and 20,000 inhabitants and the majority of these have now full secondary treatment. \n The Environment action programme announced by the Minister for the Environment in January 1990, provides for the elimination of untreated discharges from major coastal towns at an estimated cost of <*> pound sign </*> 400 million and from inland towns at an estimated cost of <*> pound sign </*> 230 million by the year 2000.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "95cc8836-61ec-48c5-b548-d5c38f76c355", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.640531+00:00"}
{"text": "<Groundwater - Ecology>\n\n\n<$A>\n  Enfo - promoting care of the environment GROUNDWATER  \n  Did you know that 99.5 <*> per cent sign </*> of the world's water cannot be used because it is either saline or is locked up in glaciers and ice sheets? Most of the remaining water is present in rocks as groundwater and less than 0.01 <*> per cent sign </*> is present in rivers and lakes. In many parts of the world where rivers and lakes are either absent or are polluted, groundwater is often the only source of fresh water. In Ireland about 25 <*> per cent sign </*> of the water we use comes from groundwater and this figure will undoubtedly rise as we become more developed. Groundwater is a resource that we need to protect because once it is polluted it cannot be used for many years. \n WHAT IS GROUND WATER?  \n Groundwater is part of the hydrological or watercycle (Diagram 1). The cycle begins with water evaporating from the oceans and forming clouds. When the clouds cool - such as when they rise over mountains - the water is released as rainfall. Some of the rain is evaporated or is used by plants and goes straight back into the atmosphere. Some flows directly into rivers and streams and from there flows back into the oceans and some percolates through the soil and into the underlying rocks - the water in the rocks is groundwater. \n\n Once in the rock the water moves slowly through the pores or cracks and emerges at ground level by coming out at springs or by flowing into rivers. \n A body of rock which contains appreciable quantities of water is called an 'aquifier'. The 'water table' in a aquifier is the level below which the pores or cracks are completely filled with water - the saturated zone. Above the water table - the unsaturated zone - the pores are filled with both air and water. In many parts of Ireland 'perched' water tables exist where impermeable material (material which will not allow water through), such as boulder clay, overlies an aquifier. In these situations water cannot get through and you get two watertables, one in the soil and one in the aquifier beneath. \n You can bring groundwater to the surface by drilling into saturated rock and pumping the water out. The amount of water that can be extracted depends on the number and size of the pores in the rock. If the rock is 'tight', such as granite, little water can be pumped out but if the pores or cracks are numerous and large, such as in fissured limestone, you can extract useful amounts of water. \n  A MAJOR POTENTIAL FOR DEVELOPMENT  \n Approximately 1,140 mm of rain falls in Ireland each year of which about 360 mm percolates through the soil and into groundwater (this is called 'groundwater recharge'). The amounts of groundwater recharge vary in Ireland, with most in the north-west (513 mm per year) and least in the south (350 mm per year). \n 50 <*> per cent sign </*> of Ireland's groundwater is considered 'developable' meaning that we could extract it relatively easily. At present we extract less than 2 <*> per cent sign </*> of the developable groundwater and of this, public bodies use 36 <*> per cent sign </*>, industry uses 37 <*> per cent sign </*> and the remainder is used for rural domestic supplies. Most groundwater is extracted in the east of the country and least in the west and north-west. Some midland and western counties have a very high dependence on groundwater - County Roscommon, for example, uses groundwater for about 80 <*> per cent sign </*> of its water supply. \n  WHY GROUNDWATER NEEDS PROTECTION  \n In general the quality of Irish groundwater is good but because we have no national survey of groundwater, like An Foras Forbartha's national survey of rivers and lakes, it is difficult to accurately assess groundwater quality. \n Although it is usually more difficult to pollute groundwater than rivers and lakes (because the soil can either stop the pollutant reaching groundwater or help to reduce its concentration) many of our activities can have an impact on groundwater quality. All too frequently we have adopted an attitude of 'out of sight, out of mind' and this has resulted in groundwater being polluted and wells having to be abandoned. Because groundwater moves slowly, once it is polluted it can remain so for many years. \n In rural areas septic tanks and farmyard activities can pollute groundwater while in and around urban areas refuse dumps would be just one source of contamination. \n A septic tank consists of a watertight container which separates liquids from solids and provides a limited amount of organic digestion, and some sort of soakage system for disposal of the liquid overflow. Because the effluent from septic tanks is not fully treated it can cause pollution. \n If you have a septic tank and it is polluting the water in your well it is probably because the tank is located too close to the well. Your septic tank can also pollute groundwater if it is situated in an area where the soil is too thin or too waterlogged to allow proper soakage of the effluent. Problems of pollution may also arise if you have used a soakage pit filled with stones rather than a proper pipe distribution system or if you do not empty your tank regularly. Diagram 2 shows a layout for a septic tank that minimises groundwater pollution. \n\n The use of silage for winter feeding has increased dramatically in Ireland over the last 20 years. When you make silage, an effluent with a great potential for pollution is generated. Unless you put a concrete slab beneath the silage and drains at the sides to collect the effluent, pollution of groundwater and rivers and lakes can occur. \n Dungheaps in farmyards can cause similar problems to those described for the silage and you need to take similar precautions to prevent pollution. \n In urban areas one of the greatest threats to groundwater quality is that posed by refuse dumps. Each one of us generates about a quarter of a tonne of refuse each year which has to be disposed of - usually by landfill. \n Domestic refuse generates a noxious leachate when water is passed through the landfill. This leachate can cause severe pollution of groundwater unless the landfill is located in a suitable area and designed and managed properly. \n To avoid pollution of groundwater, dumps need to be located where there is a thick unsaturated zone so that the leachate can be reduced in concentration before it reaches groundwater. The thickness of the unsaturated zone depends on the type of material beneath the dump - thicker in sands and gravels than in clays. Also, after each day's dumping the refuse should be covered with material which won't allow water into the refuse, because the more water you allow into the refuse the more leachate you generate. \n Even where there is a thick unsaturated zone and where you cover the refuse daily some contamination of the groundwater will occur. It is imperative that we locate refuse disposal sites only in areas where the groundwater resources have been proven to be of no great importance. \n In addition to refuse dumps, leaky sewers, leaking underground storage containers and accidental spillages have caused pollution of groundwater beneath urban areas (Diagram 3). \n\n  GETTING A SUPPLY OF GROUNDWATER  \n If you are not part of a water supply scheme and are considering a source of water then you might consider digging or boring a well and extracting groundwater. The accompanying chart shows the steps involved in getting a supply of groundwater. \n To determine how much water you will need you should allow 230 litres (50 gallons) of water a day for each person in your household. The requirement for your livestock varies from about 140 litres (30 gallons) a day for a dairy cow to about 20 litres (4 gallons) a day for 100 chickens. Having determined the total daily requirement you should then see what your peak usage would be because it is this that your well will have to yield without going dry. It is recommended that your hourly well yield be at least one sixth of your daily needs. \n Traditionally people have gone to water diviners to find out if there is groundwater beneath their land. Although a water diviner  may  be able to indicate where you should drill he will not be able to tell you how deep you will have to drill or how much water you are likely to get. This information can be obtained from the Geological Survey and has the added advantage of being free of charge! \n The type of well you use will depend to a large extent on the depth to the permanent watertable and you can check this out easily using a mechanical excavator. If you have to use a bored well check out the reputation of the well driller with those of your neighbours who have had wells drilled by him and make sure you get a written contract that specifies the terms and conditions of the drilling agreement. \n Once the well is drilled and the yield tested, the well should be sealed against pollution (Diagram 4) and disinfected. A few days after disinfection you should send a sample of water from the well to the local Health Board for analysis. The driller should send copies of the borehole log and the results of the well test to the Geological Survey. The results of the water analysis should also be sent to the Geological Survey. This information helps them to build up a regional picture of groundwater quality and quantity and so helps the next person coming along looking for information. \n\n The water quality problems you are likely to encounter include hardness (lime) and iron and iron bacteria. These problems are fairly easy to solve and the Geological Survey will be able to help you if you encounter such problems. \n\n\n<$B>\n  enfo information for the environment GROUND RULES FOR THE GREEN CONSUMER \n Green is the colour to be these days as environmental awareness grows. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the 'greening' of supermarket shelves. But how does a consumer evaluate the 'environment friendly' claims of products? Here, David Jeffrey explains some fundamental concepts and, as an aid, suggests a set of green consumer demands. \n From the ecologist's perspective the globe is being struck by the hammer of human population growth against an anvil of pollution and resource exploitation. The human race is depleting non-renewable resources, creating pollution and causing massive adverse changes in living systems. These changes increase the extinction rate of organisms and impair the functioning of ecosystems. \n All these ills may be placed at the door of the consumer, and the spirit of the age is to respond positively in some way. 'Green consumerism' is already up and running, being sent on its way by the advertising industry. \n However, the ground-rules are not yet laid down for truly meaningful efforts on the consumers' behalf. It is the environmental scientists' nightmare that this 'green' wave will pass, leaving little trace on either political or domestic consciousness. On the other hand, injection of ecological ideas may lead to some working principles. These may persist, and be incorporated into education and policy. \n  SOME BASIC IDEAS \n Environment:  The best simple definition is: 'surrounding for living things'. It includes the chemical and physical conditions represented by climate, soil, air and water. These conditions have an intense effect on the interactions between organisms in communities and ecosystems. Altering them, 'impacting' is the buzz word, has an effect on all living things within range. \n  'Environmental friendliness?'  There are no truly 'environment friendly' products. Each transaction which people make leaves an environmental trace. This is as true in the developing world as in our own, but we consume some 25 time   times   more products per capita. The only thing we can try to evaluate are comparative impacts on a unit-product basis. \n  Phases of impact:  The interaction between a product and the environment starts at the earliest stages in manufacture, continues through a 'use' phase and persists to 'post-use' or disposal. Consumerism tends to be over focused on the 'use' phase, by analogy with good value for money to the user.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "30cd5102-a96c-4cf5-a424-d024206e998e", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.641421+00:00"}
{"text": "<Natural light>\n\n\n<$A>\n GETTING NATURAL LIGHT INTO BUILDINGS \n ANN MCNICHOLL \n It is difficult to overestimate the significance of daylight, and of sunlight, in the character of a building and in the lives of the people who use it. There are, of course, some building types, such as theatres or nightclubs, where being cut off from the world outside is an essential part of the experience. In others, shops or museums for example, daylight may be excluded from large areas of the building so as to give full play to display lighting. But most interiors which are to be occupied by people (as opposed to goods or machinery) need plenty of light and, with global warming and 'Sick Building Syndrome' on our minds, natural light and ventilation have once again become critical determinants in the form our buildings take. \n Daylight is variable and unpredictable. It is these characteristics which account for peoples liking for it and for the sparkle that it brings to the interior of a building but which also make it challenging to work with. We want sunshine and daylight, but we don't like glare, downdrafts, loss of privacy, ultra-violet damage or severe temperature swings. Too much glazing, the wrong kind of glazing, or glazing in the wrong place may produce heat losses or gains which have to be countered by artificial heating or cooling. So, good daylight design must form part of a considered architectural strategy for the building as a whole, controlling and exploiting the available light, maximising its advantages and minimising its disadvantages. Most of the critical decisions are made during the early design stages. \n The design possibilities of the 'window' are, of course, extremely rich. Whether treated as a simple hole in the wall or as a complete three-dimensional element it makes a fundamental contribution to the quality of interior spaces and the external appearance of the building. The way in which it frames a view, captures light, or channels warmth, sound and air, helps determine the character of any room - whether it is intended to be simply humane and comfortable, visually exciting, or solemn, with symbolic and spiritual impact. \n The following paragraphs review some new and traditional daylighting devices and products which can be used to control daylight and sunlight, and to moderate the conflict between good daylighting and a good thermal environment which glazing so often entails. Lightwells, roof monitors and clerestory windows are well established devices for getting light deep into buildings. The atrium can be seen as an elaborated and inhabited lightwell, lightshelves and coated or prismatic glasses as sophisticated shades and blinds, while the concept of the lightpipe or transparent insulation is relatively new. Shading devices per se are not described, but these are as important, and selection of the appropriate type is particularly dependent on local climatic conditions. \n  Rooflights  \n Because the sky is generally brighter at its zenith than near the horizon, a horizontal rooflight is proportionally three times more effective as a source of daylight than a vertical window - and it casts its light over a space in a more uniform way. Direct sunlight can be diffused by translucent glazing and glare controlled by baffles. Very beautiful effects can be created by fitting angled reflectors below the rooflight or locating one beside a wall, so that ceilings or walls are washed with light. \n A disadvantage of the horizontal rooflight, compared to a vertical window, is that it collects more light and heat in summer than in winter - usually the opposite of what is desired. For this reason vertical or near-vertical rooflights, clerestories, sawtooth or roof monitors are often preferred for lighting single-storey deep spaces. They can be oriented North, South, East or West as necessary and screened with conventional shades. The duration and quality of light can be enhanced by placing light-catching scoops on the roof outside the glazing, and the distribution of reflected light into the space below controlled by rooflight geometry. \n  Lightshelves and Louvres  \n The lightshelf, a flat or curved element placed at the window opening above eye level, redirects incoming light onto the ceiling and simultaneously provides shading for the area of the room close to the window. The underside of the shelf can also redirect light from a high-reflectance exterior ground surface onto the floor inside the room. Lightshelves are most efficient when they are external, cause minimal obstruction to the window area, have specular reflective surfaces, and are combined with a ceiling of high reflectance. Interior shelves have been found to be less useful - they obstruct daylight entering the room while providing little compensating benefit. The shading control functions of a fixed lightshelf are least effective for low-angle sunlight, and in northern Europe should generally be considered only if glare is a severe problem, or window size is restricted and internal surfaces (other than ceilings) must be of low reflectance. \n Adjustable louvres with a specular finish on the upper surfaces of their blades are more responsive than lightshelves and, if completely retractable, need cause no obstruction of daylight on overcast days. Sophisticated fixed-louvre systems, incorporating lenses and mirrored faces, are now available. These are custom-made for the particular latitude and facade orientations and can combine shading with redirection of both direct and diffuse light deeper into the building. \n  Lightpipes and Lightducts  \n These are among the more mechanically complex daylighting devices. Sunlight is collected by heliostats (mirrors controlled by a tracking device), concentrated by means of mirrors or lenses, then directed to the core of the building through shafts or along acrylic rods or fibreoptic cables. Because they depend on direct sunlight, and are relatively expensive to install, they are cost-effective only in climates where blue skies and clean air can be guaranteed for much    of   the year. (Energy-efficient back-up lamps can be fixed at the head of the shaft to substitute for sunlight during infrequent overcase conditions.) The recent development of thermo-hydraulic tracking systems powered by solar cells should improve economic viability. \n  Atria  \n The daylight performance of an atrium is complex. Its proportions determine the amount of direct daylight reaching the floor - wide, shallow    ,   square atria perform better in this respect than do deep, narrow, rectangular ones. The design of the atrium walls significantly affects the distribution of light once it has entered the atrium. Dark finishes reduce internal reflectance and the deeper the atrium the more important this becomes. Windows in the atrium wall reduce reflectance also - the upper walls are the most critical in reflecting incoming light down into the atrium, so it is best to limit windows in this area. \n This arrangement corresponds with the requirements of rooms facing into the atrium - rooms at the upper levels get    of light but need protection from glare, while those at the base need to maximise the amount of light they receive. Design strategies include making rooms near the base lower, increasing their floor to ceiling heights, or stepping up the upper floors in successive steps so that all rooms have some view of the sky. (The same principles will apply to a building facade on a narrow street.) The closer the room is to the bottom of the atrium the greater its dependence on light opened from atrium walls and floor. Reflectors may be fixed on the windows of lower rooms to redirect more of the zenithal onto their ceilings, but this is generally cost-effective only when other considerations determine that the reflectances of atrium walls and floors must be low. And while rooms further from the atrium roof may have lower light levels, they may have better light quality in terms of uniform distribution and absence of glare. \n Putting any glass roof over an open court will reduce daylight levels in the court by at least 20 <*> per cent sign </*>, and sometimes by 50 <*> per cent sign </*> or more. So the structure of an atrium roof should minimise obstructions to the glazing area and its connections to the building should be such that light is allowed to wash the atrium walls. \n  Transparent Insulation  \n Transparent Insulation Materials (TIM),. which tend to be translucent rather than truly transparent, were initially developed primarily as insulation for Trombe wall assemblies. But because they transmit light, they can also function as a glazing material. There are several categories of TIM, using different materials and a variety of forms - foamed, capillary, honeycomb, fibre and gel. Most need protection on one or both sides by glass or plastic sheets. Light transmission of TIM ranges from 45 <*> per cent sign </*> to 80 <*> per cent sign </*>, with a reduction of approximately 8 <*> per cent sign </*> for each sheet of protective glass used. Insulation values are very much better than for glass. For example, 98mm hexagonal honeycomb polyamid TIM has a light transmission factor of 61 <*> per cent sign </*> combined with an insulation value five times that of a double glazed window. TIM can be incorporated into purpose-made window assemblies by most window manufacturers. Costs tend to be approximately three times those of conventional double-glazed windows. \n  Glazing Materials  \n A conventional window, single-glazed with clear float glass may transmit approximately 85 <*> per cent sign </*> of the light that falls upon it. Double or triple glazing will reduce light transmission to 70 <*> per cent sign </*> and 60 <*> per cent sign </*> respectively. Where lighting requirements demand larger areas of glass than would be thermally satisfactory, specially treated glass can be used to control heat losses or gains. \n The early tinted glasses reduced solar heat gain to some degree but also cut down daylight transmission and distorted the colour of the landscape outside. Heat absorbing glasses do not reduce daylight transmission to quite the same degree, but reduce heat gain by only 10 <*> per cent sign </*> because a large percentage of the heat absorbed is re-radiated into the interior. Reflective glass blocks solar radiation effectively (reflectances up to 50 <*> per cent sign </*> are available) but, like tinted glass, it blocks light as well as heat, and it continues to do so in winter when heat gain and daylight may be beneficial. Selective 'low-e' double glazing. with a resistance to heat loss equivalent to that of triple glazing, has a light transmission factor of approximately 80 <*> per cent sign </*>. \n Current developments include the responsive chromogenic glasses. Electrochromic glass changes its optical absorption properties and becomes dark or cloudy in response to an externally applied electric field. The opacity disappears when the field is reversed. It can be readily integrated into a responsive building climate control system. Thermochromic glass switches between a heat-transmitting and a heat-reflecting state at selected temperature thresholds and photochromic glass darkens and lightens in response to changes in light intensity. At    present,   material costs of all three are high and durability uncertain but improving. \n Glass to which a holographic film has been applied does not block radiation but diffracts it. The film can be designed to direct incoming sunlight on to a reflective surface, such as the ceiling, or deep into a room. It can be designed also to reflect sunlight coming from pre-defined angles (high-angle sun on South facades, or low-angle sun on East and West facades, for example). Up to four images containing different 'instructions' can be combined in one layer. A view out through the window is retained but from some viewing angles there is a rainbow effect. Its performance for diffused light is poor, but research is continuing. Costs are not high but at the moment holographic film is not available in the sizes needed for the building industry. \n Prismatic glass (or plastic) controls transmitted light by refraction and can be used to redirect or to exclude sunlight. The direction of incoming daylight is changed as it passes through an array of triangular wedges whose geometry can be designed for particular conditions and orientations. In several recent applications it has been used to reduce glare. Prismatic glass is translucent rather than transparent, so cannot be used where a view outdoors is required. Normally a prismatic refracting panel consists of two sheets with their prismatic faces facing each other to protect them form dust accumulation. They can also be used within double-glazed units. While the sheets themselves are inexpensive, the overall construction cost is higher than for conventional glazing. Prismatic assemblies, including sophisticated systems incorporating silvered wedge-faces and several panel types, are increasingly available.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "3037d6e0-64b9-4ea7-978b-90cf3c6b9c2a", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.642395+00:00"}
{"text": "<Cultivating abalone>\n\n\n<$A>\n<$B>\n<$C>\n Chapter 3 \n  Cultivation methods for abalone from 8-26 mm  \n Juvenile abalone of size 8 mm onwards may be maintained solely on a diet of seaweed. This allows a much less specialised form of husbandry and 8 mm is the minimum size which growers are advised to purchase abalone seed. However juveniles within the 8-26 mm size range still require a more careful handling regime than larger sizes and this is why this stage of development is still classified as a nursery stage. \n  3.1 Cage System for 8-26mm Juveniles  \n A system for maintaining this stage, presently in use and developed at the S.R.L. is a cage made from modified 250 litre plastic barrels. Each barrel has three equally spaced windows measuring 85 x 20cm cut out of its side for ventilation. Holes of 2 mm are drilled around the margin of each window to enable the attachment of an appropriate sized mesh. The cage is subdivided into three compartments by disks of 1 cm thick stockboard (the plastic equivalent of chipboard). The disks fit snugly to the sides of the barrel and are attached at three points with 7 mm polypropylene rope. The flooring ensures equal distribution of seaweed and abalone and thus prevents localized overcrowding which would otherwise occur at the bottom of the cage. \n\n Access to each compartment is via a 10 cm diameter feeding porthole which is sealed with a 10 cm (4 <*> inch sign </*> ) diameter sewer pipe stop end. The stop ends are held in place with rubber bands (car inner tubing) which are tied onto the cages and fastened at the opposite end with hooks fashioned from bullwire. Each stop end is also attached to the side of the barrel by a length of polypropylene twine to prevent loosing it. Additionally the inserted part of the stopend is cut to ensure that only a  minimal  amount protrudes into the barrel past the thickness of the walls, otherwise abalone will attach to this part and prevent its withdrawal. \n The cage is surrounded by a harness consisting of three lengths of 7mm polypropylene rope which runs along its length and are held in place by two lengths of the same rope which encircles the circumference of the barrel. The three harness ropes extend beyond each end of the barrel and are tied into rope eyesplices fashioned from a short length of 10 mm rope. The short lengths of 10mm rope are eyespliced at each end. The other eyesplice end can then be connected to a suspension rope at the top end of the barrel and on to a counterweight at the bottom end. With this design the entire strain of suspension is borne by the rope harness and not the barrel. These cages have been used with considerable success by Irish Abalone/Blackshell Farm Ltd., one of the largest of the abalone companies presently operating in this country. This company suspends its cages from surface long lines which are moored in a sheltered area in Clew Bay, Co. Mayo. The company has since substituted the cage harness and the sewer pipe stop ends for a net and flower pot ends respectively. Suspension from rafts is an alternative. However, if such methods of suspension are employed it is vital that the location is sheltered enough to ensure minimal water disturbance as abalone do not seem to respond well to jerky cage movements. In less sheltered sites a more practical alternative would be a submerged longline on which the principal floats are also submerged. \n  Alternative designs  \n A very successful variation of the barrel cage system currently in use in California involves the insertion of a window in the top and bottom of the barrel. No windows are cut into the side of the barrel. These cages are suspended from a pier in a sheltered area where there is a constant gentle wave surge. This results in a continuous piston like water movement through the inside of the cages keeping the abalone free of waste and stagnant conditions at all times. Since the pier is a solid structure which is firmly fixed to the sea floor, there is no movement at the suspension point. Counterweights attached beneath the cages prevents excessive movement in the wave surge. The American abalone culturalists have an advantage when using such a system in that the seaweed they feed to their abalone are kelps with air bladders (Macrocystis and/or  Nereocystis luetkeana  and therefore do not sink to the bottom of the cage and block the mesh ventilation windows. Because the seaweed distributes itself uniformly throughout the cage, localized overcrowding of the abalone is also prevented as they congregate around the food source. A combination of the vertical and horizontal ventilation systems has been employed in a new much improved cage design at South West Aquaculture (see caption of Fig 2.) In this design the floors must either be of mesh (not less than 6 mm) or have mesh windows in them, otherwise vertical ventilation is cut off. Care must be taken however not to weaken the barrel by cutting out too much of the side. Obviously the size and type of barrel can vary according to suitability and preference of the grower. \n  Stocking densities: mesh sizes and mesh changes  \n Stocking density trials at the S.R.L. showed an initial density of 20 8-10 mm abalone per litre of internal cage volume e.g. a 100 litre cage would be stocked with 2000 juvenile abalone of 8-10 mm. Once a shell length of 26 mm is attained the stocking level should be reduced to 5 abalone per litre. A summary of recommended cage stocking levels and mesh sizes for juvenile abalone of 8-26 mm is presented in Table 1 below. \n\n The ventilation factor of meshes below 6 mm is greatly reduced and consequently it is  extremely important  to change all meshes of below 6 mm for the next larger mesh as soon as the juveniles reach the necessary size, e.g. juveniles of mean shell length 10 mm should be contained by a 4 mm mesh and  not  grown on past this size in a cage with 2-3 mm mesh. Once the 6 mm mesh stage is attained the need    to transfer to larger mesh sizes becomes less urgent. At the S.R.L. when mesh changes became necessary for abalone in nursery cages it was the meshes on the cages that were changed and  not  the transferral of the abalone in another cage. The reason for this was that the removal of abalone from surfaces (especially if they are stuck in a corner) runs the risk of damage to the foot, particularly with abalone of less than 30 mm in size. Handling also causes stress. \n The mesh change involved carefully cutting away the twine which attached the old mesh and sewing on the new and larger mesh. This exercise was undertaken in situ and care was taken to ensure that the abalone did not dry out by periodically pouring buckets of sea water over the cage. Although the sewing method was extremely laborious the advantage was that it was safe. If preferred less time consuming techniques can be used, such as mesh windows consisting of mesh sewn onto a plastic \"window frame\". The frames can be attached to the barrels by removable nylon nuts and bolts, or they can be permanently attached by pop riveting. It must be emphasised that the recommended cage stocking levels in this manual were derived at the S.R.L. with experimental cages (see plate 3 above). \n These cages were suspended from a raft in a very sheltered area which experienced a strong tidal flow. The determining factor governing stocking levels is almost certainly ventilation, i.e. the effectiveness with which the excreted waste products of the abalone can be washed away. The presence of dissolved waste products such as ammonia above concentrations of 5 mg/litre of ammonia - N, will stress abalone and this will retard growth and make them susceptible to disease. The possibility that higher stocking rates can be obtained using other cage designs with better ventilation must be considered. Also to be taken into account is the type of water flow regime at the prospective site. A consistent but gentle flow such as the wave surge described previously is possibly more effective than an area with a strong but periodic tidal flow and both these regimes are certainly better than an area of weak tidal flow. The correct combination of cage design and water flow regime is therefore essential if stocking levels are to be optimized and the authors would suggest starting with the stocking levels given in this manual and experimenting around them. \n\n In Japan juveniles within this size range are kept in specially designed baskets of approximate dimension 150 x 70 x 30cm. The baskets consist of a frame made from plastic piping to which is attached 2-3mm plastic mesh. The floor of each basket is covered with shelters for the abalone to retire under during the day. The shelters can be made from half section of 4 <*> inch sign </*> plastic sewer pipe glued together along the sides to make a more solid and manageable structure. The baskets sit in a tank of seawater through which seawater is pumped continuously at a rate equivalent to the water capacity of the tank every 30 mins. Exchange between the tank water and basket water can be promoted in two ways:\n 1. By aeration through perforated piping located beneath each basket. (Plate 4). 2. By water circulated from the tank into the basket via air lift pumps. (Fig. 3).  \n\n  3.2.2. U.S. A. design (Plates 5).  \n A Californian hatchery grows its juveniles in 2mm baskets measuring approximately 50 <*> multiplication sign </*> 50 <*> mulltiplication sign </*> 50cm. Plastic pipe sections are placed on their ends in the baskets to provide suitable surfaces for the abalone to adhere to. Each basket is vigorously aerated through a plastic tube. In addition to oxygenation the aeration agitates the seawater in the baskets and facilitates exchange with the surrounding tank water. Each basket is apparently stocked with 5,000 juveniles. These were the stocking levels which were volunteered by the hatchery personnel and the author has no means of checking this. It strongly recommended that those wishing to try this method experiment with different stocking levels. \n Chapter 4 \n  On-growing (26 mm - market size)  \n There are 3 principal methods for on-growing abalone:\n1. Off bottom sea cages i.e. which are held off the sea floor and are suspended from piers, rafts or longlines (surface or submerged). 2. On bottom sea cages i.e. cages which rest on the sea floor. 3 Tank culture. \n  4.1 Off bottom sea cages  \n These are identical to the nursery cage designs in section 4.1. The only difference lies in the size of the meshes used and the stocking densities. These are summarized    in Table 3 below. \n\n This design originally conceived in Jersey has found favour among some growers and is constructed from modified lobster pots. This technique is currently being used successfully by Irish Abalone/Blackshell Farm Ltd. <#>, a company operating in Clew Bay, Co. Mayo. The attraction of this method is that it utilizes a current technology (lobster fishing) and is therefore particularly suited for fishermen. No rafts or longlines are necessary. The pots are laid in strings on the sea floor in suitable areas and are hauled to the surface for servicing and feeding. Each string consists of 8-10 pots connected to each other by 4 meter lengths of leaded rope. \n  Cage design  \n The pots are D shaped (length 88 cm, width at base 49 cm and height 39 cm) with an internal volume of 120L. The door edge and frame of the pot are carefully covered with neoprene insulation and car tire rubber respectively to eliminate gaps through which juveniles could crawl when the pot door is closed. Car tire rubber is also wrapped around the frame at the base of the cage to prevent abrasion. Attachment surfaces and shelter are provided by plastic barrel sections held in place with lengths of rod iron and spaced with short lengths of 3/4 <*> inch sign </*> plastic pipe (Hydrodare).

{"text": "<Radon in buildings>\n\n\n<$A>\n  Radon in Buildings <*> asterisk </*> \n J. Connell, B.Arch, MRIAI\nSenior Research Architect, Environmental Research Unit  \n  1. Introduction  \n For several years now members of the international radiation protection community have been expressing anxiety about the effect of natural radiation on the health of persons. It is expected that this concern will be given concrete expression in this country when the Building Regulations are introduced. They are expected to call for precautions to be taken to avoid danger to the health of occupants of buildings caused by radioactive substances in the ground under buildings. This will include radon which is a radioactive gas. \n Designers of buildings will be faced with a problem in complying with this requirement. This arises firstly, due to the difficulty in predicting prior to construction the likelihood of harmful levels of indoor radon    occurring   in the completed building and secondly, in advising on the type and extent of any precautions that should be taken at the design stage. There is also the matter of legal liability. It would be prudent at the present time for designers of houses, schools and certain other buildings of long time occupation, to raise the matter of radon protection with their clients, as otherwise, with the widespread awareness of the radiation problem, they could be held to be guilty of professional negligence. \n  2. Facts about Radon  \n About 13 <*> per cent sign </*> of our total radiation exposure is made up from man-made nuclear and medical activities and the remaining 87 <*> per cent sign </*> from natural sources. Exposure to any form of radiation may cause harm to the exposed person or his or her descendants and there is no intrinsic difference between artificial and natural radiation in their biological effects. In contrast to the demand for strict controls over exposure to artificial radiation sources, relatively little attention has been given to control of exposures to natural sources. This may have arisen partly from a feeling that what is natural is without harm and also from a lack of awareness about precautions which could be taken. However, in recent years there has been a growing concern among those dealing with radiation matters about the long    term   effects of radiation at all levels and the circumstances where exposure could, and probably should, be reduced. This is particularly so in the case of indoor exposure to radon and its decay products which accounts for over 30 <*> per cent sign </*> of our total radiation. \n Radon is a natural radioactive gas that has no taste, smell or colour and requires special equipment to detect its presence. It is part of the decay chain of uranium, which is widely dispersed in the earths crust, and its best known decay product, radium, which is the immediate precursor of radon. Most soil and rock have traces of radon but the amount can vary in different parts of the country and at different times of the year. Being a gas, it can move through porous media such as fractured rock and soil and some is exhaled at the surface. When this occurs in the outdoor air it is dispersed in the atmosphere and diluted to low and harmless concentrations. However, once it percolates into a enclosed space such as a building it can accumulate to dangerous levels because dispersion is restricted by the limited ventilation. The concentration will depend on the radon levels in the soil gas, the construction details of the building and the available ventilation. Radon may also be introduced indoors in ground water supplied from a well, or from building materials containing traces of radium, but normally the amounts from these sources are not of any consequence in this country. \n  3. Entry Routes  \n The increase in indoor levels of radon in recent decades is due most likely to the search for \"tighter\" building enclosures in order to reduce energy consumption. \n These levels depend mainly on the concentration of the sub-floor soil gas and the available entry points in the ground floor area of the building. As these factors usually vary from building to building each case must be considered separately. The more fragmented and porous the underlying rock and soil the greater the amount of radon gas that can rise to the surface. This gas can enter a building in a convective flow through cracks and holes in the floor area and any gaps around service pipes and cables (Figure 1). It is usually pressure-driven due to the slightly lower indoor air pressure compared with that under the floor, a result of wind and temperature difference. As might be expected, elevated levels of radon resulting from soil gas are found mainly in basements and at ground floor levels. Also, radon gas is nine times heavier than air, and therefore tends to remain close to the ground. Radon is not normally a problem in high rise buildings and if an elevated level is found it is likely to have been caused by emission from the building materials used. \n\n  4. Lung Cancer  \n The reason for concern about radon is its association with an increased risk of developing lung cancer. Radon being radioactive disintegrates and gives off decay products known as daughters or progeny which are also radioactive. These are minute particles which when released in the air may be inhaled and deposited in the lungs. As they in turn decay they give a radiation dose to the lung tissues which may eventually cause lung cancer. The risk is related to the level and length of exposure and is normally considered as a lifetime risk. While few people these days spend a lifetime in the same house it would be foolish to ignore the risk completely and for some, the predictions over a lifetime are likely to be significant. \n  5. Occurrence in Ireland  \n Radioactivity in air resulting from radon is measured in becquerel per cubic metre (Bq/m3). This unit of measurement means that radon is present at a concentration that emits one particle of radiation per second in a cubic metre of air. A survey carried out by Dr. J.P. McLaughlin of University College Dublin of a random sample of approximately 1300 houses in the State shows a median level of indoor radon of about 35 Bq/m3 throughout the country. \n <*> asterisk </*> The Editor wishes to apologise sincerely to Mr Connell for allowing the gremlins to wreak havoc with his excellent article when first published in the August/September issue. \n However, levels in excess of 400 Bq/m3 were found in 1.5 <*> per cent sign </*> of cases with individual peaks rising as high as 1700 Bq/m3. Most of these were located in parts of counties Clare, Galway, Mayo and Cork, but even in these counties the vast majority of the sample houses had a low radon level. A more recent survey of over 500 houses in some western countries was carried out by the Nuclear Energy Board and U.C.D. to identify the distribution of elevated concentration in these areas. The results indicate that about 2.8 <*> per cent sign </*> had radon levels above 400 Bq/m3 and that 9.4 <*> per cent sign </*> were above 200 Bq/m3. \n  6. Reference Level  \n Having a screening measurement carried out is the only way of knowing if a house has a radon problem. A recommended Reference Level for Ireland has been set by the Government at 200 Bq/m3 for the annual average radon gas concentration in an existing home. Above this level action should be taken to reduce it. The level of 200 Bq/m3 is also intended to apply to all future houses which ideally should be constructed so that radon concentrations are as low as reasonably practicable and be at least below this level. In existing houses, for levels up to 500 Bq/m3 it would be desirable to take action within a few years and where levels are over 1000 Bq/m3, within a year or so. \n  7. Risks  \n For most people, the risk of developing lung cancer from radon is insignificant compared with other everyday risks. Nevertheless, despite the lack of complete agreement among experts on the precise risk, it has been calculated that exposure to the Reference Level of an annual average of 200 Bq/m3 corresponds to a lifetime risk of lung cancer of about 2.5 <*> per cent sign </*>. The normal lifetime risk of contracting lung cancer in Ireland is about 3 <*> per cent sign </*>. \n International estimates now suggest that between 5 <*> per cent sign </*> and 10 <*> per cent sign </*> of lung cancer deaths may be caused by indoor radon exposure. There is also strong evidence which indicates a much higher risk from radon for cigarette smokers    than   for non-smokers. The National Radiological Protection Board in the U.K. in a 1990 publication puts this risk at 10 times that for non-smokers at all levels of exposure. This arises from a synergistic or multiplicative interaction of both carcinogens, which means that the combined effect exceeds the sum of the two effects taken independently. \n  8. Methods of Detection  \n The two most common devices used for measuring indoor radon concentrations are the alpha track detector and the charcoal canister. The charcoal canister is a small container of activated carbon which absorbs radon. It is exposed in a living area for about a week and then sent to a laboratory for analysis. The alpha track gives a more accurate reading of the average exposure but must be left in place for a longer period, usually three months, to cover the widely fluctuating daily and seasonal variations. The detector consists of a small container which allows the alpha particles released by the radon to come in contact inside the container with a small piece of special plastic in which tracks are formed by the radiation striking it. After exposure for the recommended time it is also sent to a laboratory for analysis. The    initial   screening measurement may indicate that there is no need for further action, but in some cases it may be necessary to take measurements over a longer period to get a more accurate estimate of the average level. There are other techniques requiring operation by trained personnel which can be used to give \"instant\" reading, but they are more expensive and, due to the normal variation in concentrations over a short period of time, would be certainly less reliable in determining the average radon level. \n It is possible to take radon measurements in the ground on a prospective building site, but the results may be of limited value. Alfa track detectors may be buried in holes about 600mm deep and recovered after exposure for one week. If high readings are found there is no doubt about the need for preventative measures. Low readings in the ground, however, may not be taken as a guarantee of low concentrations inside a future building on the site, as any excavation necessary during construction may increase the release of soil gas which could result in high indoor concentrations. After construction it would probably be necessary to have indoor measurements taken in both cases to find out the actual level inside the building. \n  9. Prediction of Concentration  \n One of the difficulties at present with the occurrence of radon gas is that no reliable method has been found for identifying the geographical areas most at risk. There is evidence linking high radon levels with underlying areas of uranium-bearing granite, shales, phosphate and certain sandstones, but this pattern is not entirely reliable which makes it difficult to prepare maps predicting areas of high concentrations based on geographical data. As an alternative, national surveys based on map grids are extremely expensive and lengthy exercises and result in only very general indications due to the variations in radon concentrations that may occur within small areas. \n Measurements for individual buildings may be arranged by writing to either of the following - \n Nuclear Energy Board Physics Department \n 3 Clonskeagh Square University College Dublin \n Clonskeagh Road Belfield \n Dublin 14.

The former US Congressman was unavailable for comment. \n The DUP has refused to meet the US visitors because of their intention to speak to Sinn Fein. The Ulster Unionists yesterday met the group at its Glengall Street headquarters. \n Mr Morrison said yesterday the group was in Ireland in a purely personal capacity, but would be reporting its findings to public and private officials on its return to the United States. The group supports the idea of a special US envoy being sent to Northern Ireland. \n\n\n<$F>\n  'Spare my son, kill me'  \n A Belfast mother begged UFF gunmen to kill her instead of her schoolboy son, an inquest heard yesterday. \n Gerard O'Hara (18) died in a hail of bullets as he sat watching television with his mother Bridget at their home at North Queen Street, Belfast, almost a year ago. \n Coroner Clifford Tughan heard yesterday that two masked gunmen burst into the house and shot the Belfast Telegraph newsboy, who was wounded 17 times by bullets and fragments. \n The UFF later said it carried out the killing, claiming their victim was a member of the Provisional IRA who had taken part in coffee jar bomb attacks on security forces. \n Arrests \n A detective inspector said, however, that Mr O'Hara had no known connection with terrorist activity and police viewed the killing as purely sectarian. \n He said a number of people had been arrested in connection with the crime but were later released without charge. He also said that two guns used had a history of previous use. \n In a statement read out at the Belfast inquest, Mrs O'Hara described how her youngest son had popped out to the shop moments earlier to buy cigarettes and sweets. \n When he came back he sat down with his mother to watch television.\n  \"Next thing I heard noises in the hallway and shots being fired. The glass in the door shattered and fell in. Gerard threw himself on the floor. I don't know if he hit his head or a bullet hit him.\"  \n Dead \n Mrs. O'Hara said she could see a gunman kneeling in the hallway firing into the room, and another gunman further along the hall. \n She cried out  \"Don't shoot my son, shoot me instead...he 's only a wee boy.\"  \n She added  \"I knew in my heart Gerard was dead. He was lying on the floor with blood coming from his head.\"  \n Mr Tughan said  \"He was, without mercy, executed even as his mother pleaded on his behalf that she might be taken instead of her boy. \n \"It was a killing which defies understanding and exposes the capacity for cruelty and evil within man which ultimately affects everyone in our community\".  \n\n\n<$G>\n THE MIGHTY QUINN John Laverty \n 'Goalden' strike as Bingham 's men reap triumph hat-trick \n  Wet, wet, wet at Windsor Park....and win, win, win for Northern Ireland. The rain lashed stadium last night bore witness to a little bit of footballing history, with Billy Bingham 's men recording a third successive World Cup victory for the first time.  \n Goals from Jimmy Quinn - his first for three and a half years - and Philip Gray - his first in a Northern Ireland shirt - lifted the hearts of 6,500 fans who had braved the inclement elements. \n Sadly, the gloom of World Cup failure prevails; Denmark 's 1-0 defeat of Albania earlier in the day rendered even the most optimistic mathematician 's calculator redundant. \n The win-win-win sequence of recent months has a pleasing symmetry but the draw-wind-draw start to the campaign had already produced an incline that proved ultimately insurmountable. \n Low-key \n Perhaps that scenario led to the low-key approach to last night 's encounter which was more entertaining than the Test Card - but only just. \n Let 's not, however, dwell on negative aspects of what was after all a further morale boost to our international prospects. \n Bingham wants to leave a fitting legacy to his successor and all the signs point to him achieving this. \n Gray, for instance, looks a class act and although last night 's display was not his most dynamic in a green shirt he marked it with a goal of sheer quality. \n Right back Gary Fleming 's renaissance at international level is now complete, exemplified by another purposeful display. \n And Keith Rowland looked comfortable when he came on for his first cap in the second half...another lad who can do a useful job for Northern Ireland in years to come. \n The night, however, belonged to Quinn, one of the oldest men on the park. \n Sceptics - myself included - questioned Bingham 's wisdom of picking the 33-year old Reading striker ahead of one of our more mobile midfielders such as O'Neill or Black. \n But Quinn, playing a withdrawn role behind the two main forwards responded with one of his best performances for Northern Ireland; easily the man of the match. \n He put the home side on their way with an excellent goal in the first half, had what looked like a perfectly good effort ruled out in the second and caused the Latvians all sorts of problems with his well timed runs from deep. \n Revelled \n His positioning helped Iain Dowie - the pair have tended to get in each others ' way on past occasions - and Dowie revelled in the extra space. \n Like Quinn, this was one of his best displays on a murky night when no Northern Ireland player could be faulted for effort. \n The home side dominated a first half climaxed by Quinn 's goal after 33 minutes. \n Michael Hughes swung in a corner kick from the right and the big striker timed his run perfectly to glance a header past Oleg Karavaev. \n Quinn nearly got a second just before the break but this time Kavavaev was equal to a close-range effort after Gerry Taggart had provided the opportunity with a bustling header. \n Quinn 's steady head found the rigging again midway through the second half, from new skipper Nigel Worthington 's cross, but this time the 'goal' was disallowed. \n Video re-runs hinted that Dowie had impeded a defender thus giving Quinn the necessary space but it seemed a harsh decision. \n It would have given Northern Ireland breathing space; at 1-0 there was still a trace of anxiety in their play and Latvia, for whom Popkob and Charando had looked dangerous in the first half were never totally out of it. \n Unlucky \n Taggart was unlucky to see a header, from the impressive Fleming 's cross-shot cannon back off the crossbar but Northern Ireland made the game safe ten minutes from the end. \n Again Fleming was involved, linking up with Mal Donaghy before finding Gray on the edge of the penalty area. \n The new Sunderland striker steadied himself before blasting an unstoppable left-foot drive past Karavaev. \n The back-lift was imperceptible, unlike the joy in the Northern Ireland camp. \n Binghams 's men had reigned in the rain; what a pity the deluge of good results had come to late to save the harvest.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "56ed804f-d4a9-428f-b3ad-ade8d7fc5bee", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.645316+00:00"}
{"text": "<Belfast Telegraph 2>\n\n\n<$A>\n 'Gib' case: European blow to UK David Watson \n A European ruling today pushed Britain closer to being placed in the dock over the killing by SAS soldiers in Gibraltar of three IRA terrorists. The European Commission on Human Rights ruled that there was a case for the Government to answer. \n It decided that the relatives ' case against the Government was good enough to go before the European Court of Human Rights, and the commission will launch its own inquiries. \n Danny McCann, Mairead Farrell and Sean Savage were shot dead after the SAS was called into Gibraltar in 1988 to help police there round up a suspected IRA unit thought to be preparing an attack on British troops. \n The Government will have to defend itself at an international legal inquiry against allegations that the SAS operated a shoot-to-kill policy. \n Before the decision, Ministers hoped that the arguments over the killings would not be re-opened. \n Lawyers for the relatives have spent the last two years arguing that the Government breached Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the  \"right to life\"  . \n  'Worried'  \n Niall Farrell, whose sister was killed in Gibraltar, said:  \"We are pleased that an independent international investigation is to take place. \n \"Any investigation that will honestly look at the facts must find that Article 2 was violated. \n \"I would think the British Government must be very worried at this moment, because they have an awful lot to hide.\"  \n Solicitor Barra McGrory said today 's ruling was achieved against a background of Government immunity certificates being issued. \n  \"It will probably open up the whole issue again,\"  he commented.  \"This is probably the most spectacular of all those cases and should attract international attention.\"  \n The decision means that the 25-member commission will now start its own inquiry into the Gibraltar case. When it completes it, perhaps within a year, reports will be sent to the relatives and the Government. \n The Government argued before the commission last Friday that the killings were lawful - a view already expressed at a British inquest into the deaths. \n\n\n<$B>\n Love rival had ear bitten off Rosie Cowan \n A West Belfast man bit off the ear of his wife's former lover in a  \"crime of passion\"  showdown, a court heard today. \n Desmond McAteer was given a two year suspended prison sentence at the city 's Crown Court when he admitted attacking his rival involved in the love triangle with his wife. \n McAteer (35), of Norglen Road, Turf Lodge, who is now reconciled with his wife, admitted causing grievous bodily harm to her  \"philandering\"  lover last October. \n And the court was told that the victim 's ear could have been saved - but he failed to take it with him to the hospital. \n Showdown \n The showdown between the two love rivals happened in the early hours of the morning, when the victim was woken by someone banging on his door. \n He opened the door to find a woman who asked him to speak to McAteer 's wife, Philomena, who was in his garden. He refused, saying he wanted nothing more to do with her. \n McAteer appeared and attacked the man, knocking him down. When he got to his feet again McAteer grabbed him and bit half his ear off. \n The lawyer told the court the injured party went to hospital where he was told his ear could have been sown back on if he had brought it with him, but it was not found until the next day. \n Assaults \n Defence counsel said the assault was  \"a crime of passion\"  , which had arisen out of McAteer 's ongoing marital difficulties and was  \"not assisted in any way by the philandering of the injured party\"  . \n He said McAteer had already served a six month prison sentence for two assaults on his wife, and in his view, this was part of the same situation. \n The lawyer said the father of four was now reconciled with his wife and searching for a job. \n Judge John Petrie said although the offence was very serious he felt it would be unjust to jail McAteer again as he had already served a sentence in connection with this ongoing dispute. \n\n\n<$C>\n Clinton slams Britain Vincent Kearney (political correspondent) \n The Belfast Telegraph today obtained a copy of a letter from US President Bill Clinton to a former Congressman who arrives in Ireland tomorrow to campaign for a peace envoy to be sent to the province. \n In the letter, the President supports the envoy proposal, pledges to take a more active role in helping to end the violence and criticises the role of the British Government. \n It was sent to Democrat Bruce Morrison, who is head of a group of four Irish Americans who will meet political leaders in Dublin and Belfast during a three day visit this week. \n Colleague \n A former law school colleague of Mr. Clinton and a prominent member of the Irish-American lobby, Mr. Morrison will report directly to the President on his findings. \n He is a keen supporter of the envoy option, which the President backed during his election campaign and his recommendations will be viewed as highly influential. \n In the letter obtained by the Belfast Telegraph, Mr. Clinton sets out his policy towards Northern Ireland. \n  \"I believe the appointment of a US special envoy to Northern Ireland could be a catalyst in the effort to secure a lasting peace,\"  Mr. Clinton wrote. \n  \"We believe that the British Government must do more to oppose the job discrimination that has created unemployment levels two and a half times higher for Catholic workers than Protestant workers. \n \"There can be no lasting settlement in Northern Ireland until such discrimination is ended.  \n Safeguards \n  \"We also believe that the British Government must establish more effective safeguards against the wanton use of lethal force and against further collusion between the security forces and Protestant paramilitary groups.\"  \n During their visit the Irish-American group will meet political leaders in Dublin, including Taoiseach Albert Reynolds, Foreign Affairs Minister Dick Spring. \n In Belfast he will meet Northern Ireland Secretary of State Sir Patrick Mayhew and representatives of all political parties, including Sinn Fein. \n The fact-finding visit comes in the aftermath of an upsurge in loyalist violence and comments by Albert Reynolds that the violence underlined the urgent need for inter-party talks to be resumed. \n\n\n<$D>\nFather fears revenge Press Association \n The father of Warrington bomb victim Tim Parry has cancelled a television campaign to persuade Americans to stop contributing to the IRA because of fear of reprisals. \n Colin Parry had planned to make and appeal on US television but was told by police that he and his family could be a risk if they succeeded in disrupting IRA fund-raising. \n The were warned that the IRA could target members of the family in revenge attacks. \n  \"I realised I had to change my mind when I found myself checking under my car each morning,\"  he said. \n  \"Obviously I must think of my family - they must come first.\"  \n As reported in the Belfast Telegraph on Saturday, he and his wife Wendy travelled to America as part of a televised journey to try to find a reason for the tragic death of their 12-year-old son in the bomb six months ago, which also killed three-year-old Jonathan Ball. \n But in the States they were refused an interview with NORAID, the pro-IRA Irish Northern Aid Committee. \n Mr and Mrs Parry, whose journey to Boston, Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic is documented in BBC1 's Panorama broadcast tonight, also asked Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams for a televised interview. \n Captured \n The request was declined and the Parry's refused to meet privately because they were not prepared to have a  \"mumbled apology from the likes of Gerry Adams over the mistakes of Warrington\".  \n  \"I wanted his (Gerry Adams 's) eyes to be captured. I wanted the man 's face to be seen when we put the question to him that we would have put to him,\"  he told a London news conference. \n The couple, who last week marked what would have been Tim 's 13th birthday with a special family trip to his grave, talked to Catholics and Protestants in Ireland about their view of the violence. \n Loathing \n They also met Irish President Mary Robinson and Gordon Wilson, whose daughter Marie was killed in the Enniskillen bombing in 1987 and who had a controversial encounter with the IRA in April. \n  \"We wanted to try and discover what could make individual men and women so filled with hate and loathing that they could become so inhuman as to put a bomb in a bin and kill two young children,\"  he explained. \n\n\n<$E >\n<$F>\n Burnt Out \n Emergency talks were being held at Stormont today after another night of violence in which two Roman Catholic families were burned out of their homes in Armagh. \n SDLP and Alliance delegations were meeting Security Minister Sir John Wheeler after loyalist paramilitaries targeted houses in the predominantly nationalist Legarhill Park estate, near Callanbridge, late last night. \n An elderly couple and a family with four young children were forced to leave their homes after eight petrol bombs were thrown at four houses. \n UVF and Red Hand Commando graffiti, sprayed on the walls of the houses in Armagh, warned that the attackers would return. \n Mother-of-four Anita O'Hagan, whose home was damaged, said her family was lucky to be alive. \n She, her husband Philip and children aged 11, 9, 7 and 5, spent the night at a friend 's home. \n  \"I keep thinking of how lucky my daughter was. One of the bombs hit her bedroom window but did not go off. \n \"It was just sheer panic. We just raced upstairs to get the kids out. The house was full of petrol fumes and I really did not know what was happening.  \n Dread \n  \"I don't feel at all great about returning. Now we have the added dread of knowing they will come back. But where else can you go to live? Would you feel any safer anywhere these days?\"  she said. \n Her next-door-neighbours, 82-year-old Noel McKeown, and his wife, Austin, also 82, were rescued from their burning home by    neighbours.   \n The couple, who had lived in the area for 22 years - and on whose wall the RHC daubed  \"RHC. We will be back. UVF\"  - were today staying with relatives and too upset to talk to reporters. \n Ethna Donnelly, whose home escaped damage when a firebomb exploded at the front door, said they had been targeted because of their religion. \n  \"The whole estate is living in fear. I am so angry with them. If they could only see what they did to that elderly couple,\"  she said. \n Police have appealed for anyone who was in the Legarhill Park area between 11.15pm and 11.45pm yesterday to contact them on Armagh 523311. \n The attacks are believed to have been in retaliation for the IRA bomb attack in Armagh town centre on Thursday night which caused damage estimated at <*> pound sign </*> 2.5m. \n They came at the end of a week which saw the UFF and UVF kill four people in Belfast - three Roman Catholic civilians and a Protestant prison officer. \n Fears were mounting today that loyalist paramilitaries are intent on extending their campaign of violence to other parts of the province. \n Fear \n Alliance leader, Dr John Alderdice, said he had warned the Security minister that reintroducing internment would be  \"counter productive\" . \n After an hour-long meeting, Dr Alderdice said:  \"He was certainly concerned to hear what we had to say. There were a number of important issues to discuss.\"  \n The Armagh attacks were the most sinister in a wave of arson incidents over the weekend. \n Police are treating as malicious a fire discovered at a temporary chapel at High Street, Holywood, at 1.15am today. Scorch damage was caused to an outer wall. \n Poured \n Minor scorch damage was caused to a house at Grove Street, Lisburn, when a flammable liquid was poured through the letter box at 11.15pm. Three people were in the house at the time. \n A fire badly damaged St Peter 's Presbyterian hall, Stewartstown Road, west Belfast, early yesterday morning. \n Lisburn Sinn Fein councillor Annie Armstrong said the people responsible had done  \"a grave    disservice   to the nationalist community.\"  \n And children are believed to have started a fire which destroyed Craigy Hill Presbyterian church in Larne on Saturday night.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "1269630c-b71f-4f2f-924c-1fbd9c3c99f7", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.646334+00:00"}
{"text": "<Sunday Life 1>\n\n\n<$A>\n Hounded - for taking a leak! Stephanie Bell \n Spending a penny behind a wall cost and Ulsterman his freedom - and Scottish police a small fortune! \n Police in Stranraer tracked Lurgan man Paul McCann to Northern Ireland   last week   for urinating behind a wall in Scotland   a year ago!   \n He was then: arrested by the CID in front of his girlfriend and nine-year-old son in Belfast Harbour airport. Held for three hours in Holywood Barracks. Hand-cuffed and escorted by two Scottish policemen onto the Seacat. Locked in a police cell in Stranraer for seventy-two hours. Brought to court on Monday and fined fifty pounds for giving a false name and address to police in Stranraer on September twenty-fifth nineteen ninety-two. Mr. McCann, thirty two, who had no idea he had been summonsed for the offence, was returning to England, where he now lives, on Friday after visiting his mother in Lurgan. \n When he was released he was left to find his own way back to Belfast and on to his home in England. \n The nightmare ordeal related to an incident when Mr McCann was living in Scotland last year. \n Drunk \n  \"I had been to a disco and was pretty drunk. It was about two thirty am and I went to have a pee behind a wall,\"  he said. \n  \"When the police arrested me I gave them a bit of stick and a false name and address. They put me in a cell overnight and when I sobered up the next morning I co-operated fully with them. They told me if I didn't hear anything in four weeks that I probably wouldn't be summonsed.\"  \n Six weeks later Mr McCann left Scotland thinking the police had decided not to charge him. \n He had forgotten all about the incident until last Friday. \n He said:  \"We had just checked out bags in at the airport when a CID man put his hand on my shoulder and told me there was a warrant for my arrest. \n I was devastated. It was really embarrassing being arrested in front of everybody, I felt like a murderer. \n My girlfriend and son had to fly home not knowing what was happening to me.\"  \n He pleaded guilty to three charges in Stranraer District Court on Monday and was admonished on two - disorderly behaviour and urinating in public. \n He said:  \"I had to find my own way home and spend another night in Northern Ireland before I could get a flight back to England.\"  \n Mr McCann works as an overhead linesman in Devon. \n He said:  \"I 've missed three days at work and lost about two hundred and fifty pounds in wages. I can't believe that the police would go to so much trouble and expense. \n If I had known about the summons I would have went to court. They didn't have to treat me like some dangerous criminal.\"  \n Police in Stranraer described Mr. McCann as  \"the unfortunate victim of circumstances.\"  \n Sergeant Neil McCleod told Sunday Life:  \"It is standard procedure regardless of the nature of the offence that a warrant is issued for the arrest of a person who fails to answer a summons. \n Summons \n Mr McCann has failed one way or another to answer the summons and unfortunately police are legally obliged to arrest him no matter where he is. \n Friday was probably the worst day he could have been arrested as the next court he could have appeared at was not until Monday.\"  \n\n\n<$B>\n Paisley preaches for men 's mag! \n A racy men 's magazine has featured the secrets of Ian Paisley 's preaching - alongside instructions on how to smoke    cannabis   and undress an actress! \n In a wide-ranging series on experts in their own field, the magazine 'Esquire' asked the firebrand Free Presbyterian Moderator how to capture a congregation 's attention. \n But it sandwiches the DUP leader 's advice to aspiring clergymen between bizarre tips on: how to blow smoke rings. How to breed koi fish. How to get an actress to take her clothes off. How to roll a three-skin joint. \n Among the \"experts\" interviewed by the magazine are cartoonist Gerald Scarfe, glamour photographer John Stoddard, rock guitarist Rick Parfitt and American sprinter Carl Lewis. \n Dr Paisley 's tips of successful preaching included the advice to keep the message simple, use plain English and simple words. \n  \"Transparency gives the sermon clarity. If the preacher really knows what he 's talking about, he can make the message clear and plain. It means simple words, short sentences and clear diction. \n Temper gives it conviction. The preacher must not only have mastered his subject, but his subject must have mastered him,\"  he added. \n\n\n<$C>\n Bitter Legacy of the Lover Priests \n A year ago, in the wake of the Bishop Eamonn Casey love scandal, controversial Larne priest Father Pat Buckley formed a support group for the lovers of 'celibate' Catholic clergy. \n For the first time, a journalist has been allowed to attend a meeting of the group and experience at first hand the bitter legacy of the romeo priests. \n Names have been changed to protect the women 's identities. \n The meeting is discussing the main item on the agenda - heartbreak. \n Suddenly, tears flow down the cheeks of Sandra, an attractive, dark-haired girl in her late twenties. Soon, she is sobbing uncontrollably. \n The scene is just one of many which encapsulate the way Ireland 's priest romeos are leaving a terrible legacy of heartbreak and grief in the wake of illicit love affairs. \n In a pattern played out time after time, they are shattering the lives of their lovers; frequently by accusing them of Eve-like, seducing them into breaking their celibacy vows. \n Then they dump them without mercy, leaving them to pick up the wreckage of their lives. \n Sandra 's tears came during a secret meeting of an organisation established to give these casualties of Ireland \"celibate\" clerics some emotional support. \n Set up by controversial priest Father Pat Buckley, it now has fifty-four members - a number which will astonish the many Catholics who believe that their priests are paragons of purity and virtue. \n The meeting of the organisation, Bethany Revisited, named after a scene in the Bible, was held at a secret location in Ireland. \n Among the heart-breaking stories which emerged were how one woman has had two babies after falling for a priest. Another priest has a nun as a lover, and yet another has six lovers - all at the one time! \n  'He said that I tried to trap him'  \n Before her flood of tears, Sandra had revealed that she was just seventeen when she met a handsome Catholic curate in her local parish. \n  \"I went to see him about some problems I was having,\"  she said. \n  \"I never, ever dreamed that anything could happen. I respected him as a priest. That 's the way I was brought up: very strictly.  \n Kiss \n  \"He started it. He grabbed me one day out of the blue and kissed me. I don't mean a little peck. It was a full, passionate kiss. \n He pinned me to the wall. He did this a few times, and he started something within me. I just fell in love with him. \n To hide what we were doing, we had to do all this cloak and dagger stuff.\"  \n They stopped short of full intercourse. However eventually, after a lengthy period of time, the two made love when the priest had decided to leave his active ministry - while still technically remaining a priest. \n Sandra says she has now had two children to him. \n Her tears come from a broken heart because he considers her an Eve for leading him into temptation. \n  \"After I became pregnant, he said I had tried to trap him,\"  she explained. \n  \"But I had only done so to prove to him that I loved him.\"  \n Sobbing, Sandra recalled the astounding answer the priest came up with to her pregnancy problem:  \"He told me I could have the baby adopted or have an abortion.  \n Blamed \n  \"He wanted me to go to England to get rid of our baby to save himself embarrassment. I couldn't believe it. \n As a Catholic priest, he was sworn to protect life. And he blamed me for all of it.\"  \n\n\n<$D>\n Government cash to protect Sinn Fein Alan Murray \n The Government is expected to provide financial assistance to help protect Sinn Fein advice centres from loyalist attacks. \n Sunday Life has learned that the Northern Ireland Office will stump up taxpayers ' money to the IRA 's political wing for the protection of its premises. \n Attacks \n It is understood the NIO will provide a percentage of the total cost of installing extra security measures at centres. \n The change of policy follows recent attacks by loyalist paramilitaries on Sinn Fein advice centres. \n Siege \n In May loyalists opened fire on Sinn Fein advice centre in Lepper Street, north Belfast. Two men were later arrested - one was shot by an Army marksman and the other taken from a house following a siege. \n Two months later, in a separate incident, the Lepper Street advice centre was attacked by the UFF. \n A blast bomb was thrown but the device failed to explode. \n A source told Sunday Life:  'The NIO will provide financial assistance to Sinn Fein to provide security measures at its advice centres. \n \"Even though most of its offices are protected with security grills and reinforced doors, the NIO will provide money for any more security measures that are needed.\"  \n Sinn Fein councillors have also applied to the NIO for financial assistance for security measures at their homes, but this has been turned down. \n A number of councillors are asking for a judicial review of an RUC decision not to give them the go-ahead to get personal protection weapons. \n A decision on the review is expected in the High Court within the coming weeks. \n An NIO spokesman told Sunday Life:  'The matter of providing financial assistance for security at Sinn Fein advice centres is still under consideration.\"  \n\n\n<$D>\n The March of Time \n Special report on how the Army has changed in twenty-four years on the streets of Ulster. \n The march of time in Ulster has transformed the British soldier, as these pictures reveal. Almost twenty-five years after the troops were first deployed in the province their equipment, combat gear, training and role in the conflict has changed dramatically. \n The tin-hatted soldiers who were sent into to quell riots on the troubled street of Londonderry and Belfast must look enviously at the gear provided for the modern soldier. \n For the troops who were sent here in the summer of nineteen sixty-nine were ill-prepared for urban conflict. \n  \"In the early years training was haphazard. For a start, few were absolutely certain what to train for,'  recalled one former officer. \n Sent into to keep the peace between warring communities the first soldiers had no more legal powers than the ordinary citizen until the Special Powers Act gave them power to stop and question, search and arrest without a warrant. \n Most noticeably the troops were poorly equipped to deal with riots. \n Their standard British Army issue tin helmets were not fitted with any kind of visor to protect against stones and other missiles. \n And when the first visors were introduced they made the heavy hats flop down over the troops ' faces. \n Lighter glass-reinforced helmets, with better ballistic and shock protection, were later developed. \n Riot shields were issued in nineteen seventy but they were clumsy, metal shields which were later replaced by perspex versions. \n And the early soldiers had to endure heavy, badly fitting World War II style combat clothes until the mid-nineteen seventies. \n  \"Today 's fatigues are lighter but warmer, showerproof and give a limited protection against flames also. They are a lot more comfortable,\"  said an Army spokesman. \n Communications were also a nightmare for first soldiers in Ulster - their primitive radio sets were a disaster in built-up areas. \n Helicopters were used to provide an airborne relay station but if they were shot down or ran out of fuel, soldiers on the ground often had to resort to the GPO telephone system. \n Over the years the Army turned to off-the-shelf civilian radio equipment to provide essential communications. \n Army training has also changed dramatically as a result of the Ulster conflict. \n A standard Northern Ireland training package has been in operation for some time including intensive urban and rural patrolling, riot control techniques, shooting at fleeting targets, powers of arrest, orders for opening fire, bomb and weapon recognition. \n  \"Soldiers now go to Northern Ireland well-prepared and trained,\"  said one officer.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "26f9ec2d-fefb-4515-bf3d-16c00a16db9f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.647300+00:00"}
{"text": "<Belfast Telegraph 3>\n\n\n<$A>\n RUC denies bias claim Oliver McGuckin \n Police efforts to deal with loyalist terrorism were today vehemently defended by RUC Chief Constable, Sir Hugh Annesley. \n Rejecting suggestions that police were less vigorous in their pursuit of loyalists than in the fight against the IRA, Sir Hugh said such a charge was  \"neither accurate or fair\"  . \n In a strong statement issued from RUC headquarters, he added:  \"The proof of our impartiality and professionalism lies in the facts: the arrests which have been made, the charges which have been preferred, and in our absolute determination to counter all terrorism without fear or favour.\"  \n Operations \n His remarks came after the sectarian murders of four Catholics in the past nine days. \n The death of the latest victim - 40-year-old hairdresser Sean Hughes in west Belfast yesterday - led to calls by local MP Dr Joe Hendron for more high-profile operations by the security forces in loyalist areas. \n Stressing that the threat from both loyalist and republican paramilitaries remained very serious, Sir Hugh called on the public to use its  \"eyes and ears\"  to help save lives. \n Targets \n  \"In both communities there are terrorists meeting and plotting outrages, using cars and houses, moving about and acting suspiciously in various ways. Be vigilant and tell us what you see and hear.\"  \n Referring again to accusations of a one-sided approach by police, he declared:  \"From where we stand murder is murder. There is no excuse, no nods and winks, no legitimate targets. Murder is murder.\"  \n The Chief Constable said 26 of the 45 deaths from violence so far this year were attributable to loyalists. The total number killed was 16 fewer than at the same time last year. \n Equipment \n  \"To date this year there have been 172 bomb incidents, 54 fewer than in the same period last year. Republican terrorists were responsible for 142 (83 pc) and loyalist terrorists for 30 incidents (17 pc).\"  \n The security forces had seized 130 firearms, some 10,000 rounds of ammunition and approximately 32,500 lbs of explosives and bomb-making equipment. \n  \"That is a substantial achievement which represents lives saved and massive destruction prevented.\"  \n Arrests \n Police had also charged 259 people with terrorist-type offences. Of these, 166 were loyalists and 93 republicans. \n  \"Without going into detail, for legal reasons, I can say that in respect of both republican and loyalist terror groups, a series of significant arrests have been made and a considerable number of murder and bombing missions intercepted and prevented. As a consequence, more lives were saved and intended devastation frustrated.\"  \n In Belfast - where 19 murders have occurred this year (15 by loyalists and 4 by republicans) - some of the  \"most significant\"  arrests have been made. \n  \"Every possible measure, both overt and covert, is being taken,\"  the Chief Constable said. \n\n\n<$A>\n Hospital cleared at inquest Oliver McGuckin \n Hospital staff were not in any way to blame for the tragic death of a nine-day-old baby boy from west Belfast, an inquest has been told. \n Stephen Martin Phillips, of Glenalina Park, died from a very rare infection of the umbilical cord. \n Belfast Coroner 's Court heard the baby was re-admitted to hospital six days after his mother gave birth by caesarian section on January 18 last. \n Witness \n Anne Marie Phillips fought back tears as she told how she had repeatedly warned staff at the Royal Maternity Hospital that she  \"did not like the look of the baby 's belly button\"  , which was swollen and discoloured. \n Witness said she was told not to worry and that her son would be fine. \n Mrs Phillips said the baby did not settle when they were allowed to go home and she expressed continuing concern to a community midwife. \n After being taken into the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children on January 24, the infection had spread and Stephen was put on a course of antibiotics. \n Died \n When doctors told her early on January 26 that the baby was seriously ill and was being taken to theatre for an operation, she asked them:  \"How come you left it so late?\"  \n Stephen died in his mother 's arms early the following day. \n Mrs Phillips ' sister Bernadette Morrow, told the inquest that the death had left her and her family feeling that Stephen had been neglected. \n She said her own two children were delivered at the Royal Maternity Hospital, but she would be afraid to entrust any other children to the hospital 's care. \n Consultant paediatrician Dr Mark Reid, who carried out a report on the baby 's death, said he felt all the doctors involved had given consistent and correct advice. \n While he could understand the  \"natural anger and grief\"  of the child 's parents, he did not believe that medical negligence was a factor in Stephen 's death. \n Dr Reid added that it would have been difficult to suggest any change in the administration of antibiotics. \n Deputy State Pathologist Dr Derek Carson said the death was due to an infection of the abdominal wall which had spread from the stump of the umbilical cord. \n Sympathy \n Dr Carson described it as a  \"very rare\"  cause of death and said that neither he nor his colleagues had ever seen cases with such severity of infection of the umbilical cord. \n Coroner John Leckey, extending his sympathy to the Phillips family, said many of the questions that had sprung to his mind had been answered. \n He believed there was nothing that medical science could have done to have changed the tragic outcome. \n\n\n<$B>\n Sealink sails into row Darwin Templeton \n A war of words erupted today after Stena Sealink claimed victory in the three-way battle of the waves over the critical summer peak period. \n Representatives for Seacat and P <*> ampersand </*> O issued blunt replies after Sealink claimed to have left its rivals trailing in its wake over the summer. \n Sealink released figures for their performance from June 27 to August 28, claiming that it carried 38,493 more passengers and 10,818 more cars between Larne and Stranraer than last year. \n That represented 12 pc more passengers and 17 pc more cars, increasing their overall market share to 55.6 pc in both. \n But a spokesman for P <*> ampersand </*> O accused Sealink of being selective in their choice of dates, saying:  \"Two months don't make a year. We have carried 25 pc more passengers and 34 pc more cars in the year from January 1 to the end of August - that is what counts.\"  \n And a Seacat spokesman said:  \"Our market share is a very satisfactory 24 pc. \n But for Seacat the Northern Ireland public would still be travelling in mundane vessels and having to pay a hefty price for the privilege.\"  \n But Sealink did admit that their numbers had fallen over the nine months from January 1 to Monday of this week, by 20,755 passengers and 9,644 cars. \n Sealink estimates that the market as a whole grew by 16.2 pc in terms of passengers and by 16.5 pc in cars between January 1 and Monday. \n  \"Whilst we did loose volume slightly at the start of the year, we have outperformed our competitors during the vital summer peak period,\"  a Sealink spokesman said. \n\n\n<$C>\n He Deserved It - TD Suzanne Rodgers \n Donegal TD Jim McDaid today welcomed the three-month sentence handed out to his teenage son for making hoax bomb telephone calls in London. \n But the Fianna Fail Deputy, who is no stranger to controversy, said the scandal could have serious repercussions on his political career. \n Mr McDaid 's 19-year-old son, Jason, was given a three-month sentence at Camberwell Magistrates 's Court yesterday when he pleaded guilty to making two hoax calls warning of a bomb in Oxford Street from a kiosk. \n The court heard that he made the calls after a drinking spree celebrating his nineteenth birthday three weeks ago. He was arrested within minutes of making the calls. He has been in custody since. \n Mr McDaid, a medical doctor in Letterkenny, who is TD for Donegal North-East, said:  \"He deserves the punishment he has been given. The whole family must suffer the consequences of an absurd and stupid act.\"  \n Adverse \n  \"It was an outlandish, absurd and unbelievable thing for an intelligent young man to do,\"  he added. \n Deputy McDaid has conceded that the incident could have an adverse affect on his political career. \n Mr McDaid was at the centre of another controversy in November 1991 when he was appointed Minister of Defence by the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey. But he withdrew his own nomination less than 12 hours later when his involvement with Maze escaper James Clarke became public. \n Deputy McDaid had given alibi evidence at Clarke 's successful challenge to an extradition order and was photographed with him at his home-coming celebrations in Letterkenny. \n\n\n<$D>\n How the young in Ulster compare Ian McTear \n Youngsters in Northern Ireland smoke more, drink less and have been offered drugs more often than their British counterparts. \n They also get the largest amount of pocket money in a week - <*> pound sign </*> 5.20, compared with a UK average of <*> pound sign </*> 3.62 - and are most likely to put it in the bank. \n The snapshot of the lifestyles of the province 's youngsters was taken by a survey for The Early Times newspaper, involving 200,000 young readers with an average age of 13 nationwide. \n It revealed Ulster youngsters were the most likely to have been offered drugs (21 pc compared with a national average of 10 pc), were least likely to drink (21 pc compared with 30 pc) but were most likely to smoke (36 pc compared with 18 pc). \n Health \n There was more bad news on the health front as they were the least likely to say they try hard for a healthy diet (37 pc compared with 24 pc). \n They are also unhappiest with their appearance, as only 61 pc were happy with theirs, against a national average of 69 pc. \n On the family front they were the most likely to put their parents in a home (43 pc compared with 29 pc). <#>\n This may be connected to the fact that the youngsters came bottom as far as hugs were concerned, as 57 pc said their parents hugged them compared with a national average of 70 pc. \n Couple \n Traditional values still hold sway as 86 pc of Ulster youngsters thought it was important for a couple to marry before having children, when the national average was 72 pc. \n They were also the most likely to say Dad would not make a good job of being a housewife and should be out at work (57 pc compared to 38 pc). \n They were also the most likely to say the Government does not care about education (92 pc compared with 66 pc). \n\n\n<$E>\n Time out to dream of an ideal home Gail Walker \n It didn't take the small but determined palmist, medium and clairvoyant Verran Boswell to tell me I would never afford the 'Dream House' at the Ideal Home Exhibition. \n But she did anyway.

{"text": "<Belfast Telegraph 4>\n\n\n<$A>\n Jet fumes cause sickness - claim Gail Walker \n More than 100 people have accused Belfast City Airport of literally making them sick. \n In the past four weeks about 130 residents living close to the Sydenham base have complained of nausea and headaches which they blame on aircraft fumes. \n Some have suffered symptoms so severe that they have been given medication by their doctor. \n Ulster Unionist councillor Jim Rodgers says the situation is so serious he has contacted the airport to see what can be done. \n  \"At least 130 people have either rang or written to me in the last few weeks. \n \"They all live in the Sydenham, Inverary Park, Holywood Road, and Garnerville area and say they have been feeling very unwell. \n \"The problem seems to occur when the Whispering Jet 146 is preparing for take off and it depends on how bad the winds are as well. \n \"But I know that some people have felt so miserable they have seen their doctor for some medicine and have been told that the fumes are the likely cause of their symptoms. \n \"I, myself, have been observing this jet as it gets ready for take-off and there is a definite smell of fuel.\"  \n But Belfast City Airport today denied that the Whispering Jet - so named because of its low noise - could cause ill health. \n A spokesman said:  \"We have no reason to believe the aircraft has been causing a problem. \n \"It has been operating out of the airport for the past five years and on a more frequent basis than it is doing now and we have not had any    complaints   of this nature in the past. \n \"We would like to point out that these residents are also living beside a busy dual carraigeway and a railway line.\"  \n The spokesman said airport staff had met with Mr Rodgers and had now asked the councillor to put his complaints in writing. \n Mr Rodgers said that he was not an opponent of the airport and added that staff at the base had been very helpful. \n  \"This airport has brought a lot of employment for both sides of the community and I believe we have to back this. I am sure the problem can be sorted out.\"  \n\n\n<$A>\n Poyntz slams the men of violence Gail Walker \n Mourners at the funeral today of murdered prison officer Jim Peacock will hear a hard-hitting address from the Bishop of Connor, Dr Samuel Poyntz. \n Speaking before the service, Dr Poynz said that his sermon would be  \"very direct\"  but added:  \"Wrong is wrong and must always be condemned\"  . \n Hundreds of people were expected to attend the service for Mr Peacock, who died in his teenage daughter 's arms minutes after UVF gunmen shot him in the back at his north Belfast house. \n Private \n A private service, attended by his wife Sandra and children Mark, Lisa, Samantha, Kelly and Penny, was being held in the family home at Joanmount Park at noon. \n The cortege was then due to make its way to Holy Trinity Parish Church on the Oldpark Road for a service at 1pm. \n All prisons and the Young Offenders Centre cancelled visits and parcel deliveries today to enable many of Mr Peacocks colleagues to attend the funeral. \n Slept \n Fifteen children have been left without a parent after loyalist terrorists murdered four people this week. \n Roman Catholic mother-of-four Teresa Dowds de Mogollon was shot dead in her north Belfast home and Catholic delivery man Jim Bell was killed outside an ice-cream factory in the east of the city. \n Father-of-six Michael Edwards was murdered in bed as he slept beside his wife yesterday. \n After the service, Mr Peacock was being buried in Ballymoney Cemetery later this afternoon. \n The Northern Ireland Prison Service said that any visitors holding passes for today should contact their relevant prison on Monday to rearrange their visit. \n\n\n<$B>\n Caught in the act ... John Laverty \n The referee at the centre of the Dinamo Tbilisi bribes scandal DID accept the 5,000 dollars offered by the Georgian club prior to their European Cup match with Linfield. \n But Mr Erman Torughu handed over the cash to UEFA on Thursday as evidence of a bribe, prompting Tbilisi 's sensational dismissal from the competition. \n Tbilisi have 48 hours to appeal the decision but it looks as if Linfield are back in the competition - and suddenly <*> pound sign </*> 100,000 better off courtesy of UEFA payments and television rights. \n The news was greeted like a pools win at Windsor Park, a mix of euphoria and amazement. \n Chairman David Campbell said:  \"We 're still in a state of shock over this development. \n \"As far as we were concerned Tbilisi had won the tie fair and square. \n \"The idea of them trying to bribe the Turkish officials is nothing short of astonishing.\"  \n Manager Trevor Anderson added:  \"I 've played all over Europe and have never come across this sort of thing before. \n \"I suppose we should be flattered that Dinamo Tbilisi felt they needed a little help to get past us. \n \"It 's an unsavoury business but anyone involved in this sort of corruption deserves everything they get.\"  \n FC Copenhagen, who were due to play Tbilisi in the first round proper, have no doubt that Linfield will now be their opponents - in Belfast on Wednesday week. \n Manager Benne Johannsen said:  \"We are already making travel arrangements for Belfast. \n \"I can't see UEFA overturning their decision. They do not make decisions like this on the spur of the moment. The evidence against them appears to be overwhelming.\"  \n Johannsen accompanied Linfield to Tbilisi for the first leg game in Georgia, and like everyone else was unaware of the cash offer to the Turkish officials. \n  \"It took me completely by surprise,\"  he said. \n  \"Having said that I 'm not disappointed that we 're set to play Linfield and not Tbilisi. \n \"I saw at first hand the problems Linfield had with travel arrangements and communications ... give me Belfast every time.\"  \n It 's likely Tbilisi will appeal the decision, with UEFA hearing it next Saturday - but FC Copenhagen would like a earlier confirmation.  \"As far as we 're concerned we will arrive in Belfast a week from Monday. A Saturday decision would give us very little time to alter our plans,\"  said the manager. \n The first inkling that something was amiss came on Wednesday, when Linfield were requested by UEFA to organise flights for Tbilisi officials to Geneva. \n The Blues suspected the Georgians would be carpeted for their haphazard arranging of the first leg tie; the Windsor Park club had already complained to UEFA about this. \n But Linfield had no idea that Dinamo were being investigated for suspected bribery. \n Secretary Derek Brooks said:  \"We arranged flights for club president Marab Jordania and Georgian FA president Nodar Akhalkatsi; they flew to Geneva while the rest of the party took a chartered flight to Georgia. \n \"There was no inkling that a bribery scandal was about to unfold; we certainly didn't instigate it.\"  \n A UEFA spokesman explained:  \"The referee presented his match report which stated that money had been offered to both him and his officials. \n \"He presented this as evidence at our investigation on Thursday and the action we took was as a direct consequence.\"  \n\n\n<$C>\n Dunnes get fine for beetle infested soup \n Dunnes Stores has been fined <*> pound sign </*> 100 after 14 beetles and 24 larvae were found in a packet of dried soup being eaten by a Kilkeel woman. \n The firm was also ordered to pay <*> pound sign </*> 110 costs at Newry Magistrate 's Court yesterday. \n Strange \n Dunnes Stores was charged with selling Knorr Bavarian dried soup not of quality demanded, at its shop in Greencastle Street, Kilkeel, to Mrs Lorraine Trainor of Fearon Park, Kilkeel, last January. \n Rory McShane, for Newry and Mourne Council, said Mrs Trainor 's daughter noticed something rather strange about it when she started to eat the soup. \n She discovered the material was rotten and that it was contaminated. \n The public analyst found it contained 14 beetles, 24 larvae and nine pupal cases, also that it had the characteristics of the Australian beetle, which attacts and infects dried food products. \n There was a small hole about one-and-a-half millimetres wide in the packet, through which the initial infestation could have arisen. \n Counsel for Dunnes, which pleaded guilty to the charge, said this could not have occurred in the store at Kilkeel. It seemed certain it happened at the time of manufacture. \n Regional Magistrate Gerry Harty agreed that the firm had a good record and said it bought vast quantities for distribution to its various stores. \n\n\n<$D>\n Baby Caolan sees in his first birthday Darwin Templeton \n This is the day that many thought Belfast double transplant baby Caolan McDonald would never see - his first birthday. \n Just weeks ago Caolan was given eight hours to live, as a frantic search was started across Europe for a donor liver. \n But the tiny tot - whose name means \"fair haired slender lad\" - has defied the medics and the odds to survive. \n Priority \n He has now been taken out of intensive care and is eating and putting on weight. \n Caolan 's aunt, Eileen, said it was a very happy day for the family, but that the double transplant operation was still a priority. \n  \"We aren't putting too much emphasis on his first birthday - we will celebrate when he gets his operation,\"  said Eileen. \n  \"They are going to have a party on the ward. A lot of children are sick so they will just be having a quiet gathering.  \n Presents \n  \"But there will be plenty of presents, I can tell you.\"  \n Caolan was born this day last year with a rare stomach complaint that claimed his bowel at birth and then destroyed his liver. \n Father Brendan said:  \"We are being allowed to take Caolan out of the hospital today for the first time in three months. \n \"He is doing great now, but his condition could deteriorate in the blink of an eye. \n \"Either way we are going to enjoy ourselves today.\"  \n\n\n<$E>\n Pensioner strikes it rich with Roman treasures Press Association \n Retired gardener Eric Lawes was today looking forward to a glowing future as a probable multi-millionaire after a coroner 's jury decided that a hoard of 14,000 Roman coins and jewellery he found with his metal detector is treasure trove. \n But 70-year-old Mr Lowes, who unearthed the historic treasures while searching for lost tools on Home Farm, at Hoxne, Suffolk last November, is totally relaxed about the whole thing. \n After yesterday 's jury ruling in Lowestoft, a calm Mr Lawes said:  \"I am glad it is all over. We shall just wait and see now. \n \"I was not that excited. It was just one of those things.  \n Public \n  \"The place for this is in the British Museum for all the public to see.\"  \n He will share the money with his friend Peter Whatling, the tenant farmer of the land where the treasure was buried. \n Mr Lawes and Mr Whatling said they had signed a partnership deal once it became clear how important the find was. The cash will be decided on by a special committee from the Department of National Heritage. \n Mr Lawes was praised for bringing in experts from Suffolk County Council 's archaeological department, who were astonished to find thousands of coins, sets of spoons, pepper pots and other valuables from the fifth century. \n\n\n<$F>\n Cures come from the Orient Laurence White \n The mysteries of Oriental alternative medicine are about be unveiled in Co Down. \n A clinic offering Chinese natural health treatment is to open at Ballyward, near Banbridge. \n Dr Hao Rifang, who has practised in China, Poland and London, will carry out acupuncture and herbal therapy at the Closkelt Road premises. \n The centre is the idea of local businessman Nari Sherewani. \n Clinic \n He said: \"I got interested in Chinese medicine during my travels in the Far East and eventually was introduced to Dr Hao in England.\"  \n She agreed to visit Northern Ireland to examine the feasibility of setting up a clinic here and has been granted a four year work permit. \n Dr Hao said herbal therapy and acupuncture works best in the treatment of skin diseases such as dermatitis and eczema, and internal disorders such as headaches, ulcers and gastritis, using natural products. \n Symptoms \n She said it can also be used for the relief of pain, emotional and sexual problems and as an aid to stopping smoking. \n  \"Chinese medicine works on the principle of treating the causes not the symptoms.

Another six inch long wound on his stomach is not as deep, but the area is badly swollen and he has another inch deep wound on his front leg where the knife was stuck in.\"  \n Mr Fox said one attack was bad enough, but four in the space of months was  \"horrific\" . \n  \"It is just impossible to understand the sick, perverted mentality of someone who could stab horses in this way,\"  he said. \n\n\n<$C>\n UVF admit murder bid on Protestant Gary Grattan \n The UVF have admitted they tried to kill a Protestant man in east Belfast last night. \n But, in a call to a Belfast newsroom, the loyalist terror group denied there was any political or sectarian motive for the attack. \n Ponytail \n Police have discounted a sectarian motive and are pursuing  \"a specific line of enquiry.\"  \n The 43-year-old victim was  \"very seriously ill but stable\"  after undergoing emergency surgery in the Royal Victoria Hospital. \n He was shot twice in the chest by a lone, unmasked gunman at the front door of his home at Palmerston Park, Holywood Road, at around 9.40 pm. \n Police have issued a description of the gunman. He is said to be aged between 29-30, around 6 ft tall and of slim build with a thin face, dark eyebrows, narrow eyes and a long narrow nose. \n He is thought to have a short ponytail and was wearing a black leather jacket and dark denim trousers. \n Leading loyalist, Gerry Drumgoole - wounded in an INLA murder bid in the Shankill area yesterday afternoon - was today said to be  \"stable\"  in hospital. \n Mr Drumgoole, who is in his early 30s, was shot once in the stomach by two INLA gunmen as he sat outside his home in Hazelfield Street. \n Action \n The gunmen continued to fire at the house after he managed to scramble inside and slam the front door shut. \n The shooting is seen as retaliatory action following the murders of three Roman Catholic civilians by the UFF and UVF last week. \n Mr Drumgoole lost a leg and part of an arm in an under-car IRA booby-trap blast at Dover Street in November 1991. \n\n\n<$D>\n Man jailed for killing his girlfriend Marie Foy \n An alcoholic who admitted killing his five months pregnant girlfriend was jailed for five years today. \n Jennifer Trimble (32), died two days after receiving head injuries during a drunken row with the accused Thomas Wightman in February last year. \n Belfast Crown Court heard that the couple 's six-year relationship had been stormy and that they had hit each other on numerous occasions. \n Cuts \n A Crown lawyer said police were called to the pair 's Donard Street home in Belfast after neighbours heard shouting and fighting. \n Officers found Wightman (35), with cuts to his eye. Ms Trimble was lying unconscious on a settee in the front livingroom. \n She had severe bruises to the face and eyes and her head was wrapped in a towel. \n She failed to regain consciousness and died two days later in hospital. \n The prosecution said that the two had been out drinking and had started to fight when they came home. \n Wightman told police he hit his girlfriend 's head against the bathroom door or wall, but said he had not intended to kill her. \n Defence lawyer Tony Cinnamond said, however, that Wightman 's recollection of the events were hazy due to drink and it could have been that he struck her and her head banged against the wall. \n  \"Almost certainly this was a very unlucky blow for her and for him,\"  he said. The lawyer said the pair had fallen deeply in love and his client was  \"devastated\"  by what had happened. \n Passing sentence, Lord Justice MacDermott said:  \"The background to this case is one of excessive drinking and violence.\"  \n He told Wightman:  \"People simply must not be violent towards each other.

I feel we 're being discriminated against. \n \"My son lives in England and he saved up the vouchers to buy the ticket and posted it to me. It means a saving of about <*> pound sign </*> 100. \n \"Yet they say we wouldn't be interested in it here. \n A Shell spokeswoman said that, after a Heritage wine glass promotion finished in August, there was a six-week gap with no offer. \n  \"We didn't go in on the free travel promotion because many of the deals involved British Rail and we don't have it here,\"  she said. \n  \"In the meantime, we have the Classic Cars promotion until another national one begins at the end of the month and we 'll be participating in that.\"  \n\n\n<$F>\n Top volume Whitney gets fan jail \n Whitney Houston was the weapon in a war of noise waged by a Teesside woman against her neighbour, a court has heard. \n Floorboards vibrated and door handles shook as the star 's hit song I Will Always Love You blasted out from Helen Stephen 's home, Teesside County Court was told. \n On one occasion workmen using a sledgehammer across the street warbled along with the star after hearing Helen 's tape. \n Next door neighbour Susan Hanley told Judge Peter Fox QC the noise was like  \"a psychological form of torture\" . \n Helen (20) was yesterday locked up for seven days for what the judge described as a  \"nasty campaign of noise and harassment\"  . \n Complaints \n Helen 's tearful mother Anne Stephens said today:  \"Whether you believe it or anyone else believes it my daughter is innocent and she 's been sent to prison for a week for something she hasn't done.\"  \n Mrs Stephens, who is considering appealing against the ruling, added:  \"Helen is a nice quiet girl and she wouldn't do anything like this.\"  \n Referring to complaining neighbours the Hanleys she said:  \"I just don't know how they can sleep at night next door because I couldn't, knowing that I 'd done that to someone.\"  \n Judge Fox told Helen she had  \"attacked\"  her next door neighbours with loud and repeated playings of Whitney 's hit song from the film The Bodyguard. \n Helen, of Moulton Grove, Fairfield, Stockton, burst into tears and had to be supported by relatives after being told she was going to a young offenders institution. \n Last night court bailiffs took Helen by taxi to Low Newton Remand Centre to start her sentence. \n After the case distraught Mrs Stephens, who was herself fined <*> pound sign </*> 200, condemned neighbour Mrs Hanley.

{"text": "<Belfast Telegraph 6>\n\n\n<$A>\n Loyalist killings overshadow Anglo-Irish talks. Political Staff \n  The shadow of loyalist paramilitary killings today hung over the latest Anglo-Irish talks in London as Ministers struggled to chart a fresh path to political talks.  \n Security was top of the agenda for the meeting, with the Irish Government demanding further information on the threat of loyalist bomb-attacks in the Republic. \n Both Governments regard the current upsurge in loyalist murders as an urgent incentive to get the political parties back around the negotiating table. \n The urgency of the issue was marked by the presence of Stormont Security Minister Sir John Wheeler, who broke off his holiday to join his Dublin counterpart, Justice Minister Maire Geoghagan-Quinn, for the talks. \n RUC Chief Constable Sir Hugh Annesley, whose warning of the threat of loyalist bomb-attacks in the Republic has alarmed Dublin, and Garda Commissioner Patrick Culligan were also present. \n Speaking before the meeting - which began almost an hour late after the Irish party 's flight from Dublin was delayed - Secretary of State Sir Patrick Mayhew spoke of the concern, felt in both London and Dublin, about the upsurge in violence. \n Sir Patrick, welcoming Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring, rejected suggestions that relations between both Governments had been at a low ebb after their last talks in July and stressed that both were treating the worsening security situation  \"very seriously\"  . \n Speaking before the meeting, he also made clear that, despite a negative public stance by some parties, there were still good grounds for a resumption of the dialogue. \n However, the official message belied private concern that the prospects for fresh talks have worsened since the last Anglo-Irish meeting in July. \n Sources predicted that there would be no sign of the frostiness which greeted Mr Spring 's suggestion, in a Guardian interview in July, that both Governments might have to bypass the parties and aim for joint rule. \n However, there was expected to be friction between Taoiseach Albert Reynolds and Sir Hugh Annesley about the warning of loyalist attacks in the Republic. \n Mr Reynolds said he was  \"disturbed\"  by the content of what Sir Hugh said on Wednesday and rebuked him for  \"going public\"  . \n\n\n<$B>\n Bomb woman is jailed. Rosie Cowan \n Murder mission: 'Mata Hari-type' actress sentenced to twenty years \n Terrorist Rosena Brown smiled and waved to family and friends amid shouts of republican slogans as she was jailed for twenty years at Belfast Crown Court today for her part in a murder mission. \n The court heard the double life of the actress and mother of seven from Bunbeg Park in west Belfast, came to an end when she was caught red-handed driving a car with a bomb in it outside Larne on April eighteenth last year. \n Brown was named in court in nineteen ninety as the Mata Hari-type IRA spy who seduced prison officer John Hanna into setting up colleague Brian Armour to be murdered. \n Conspiracy \n An RUC Special Branch officer told Hanna 's trial that police considered recruiting as a double agent Brown, who starred in a NIO 'Crack Crime' advert. \n Today, co-accused Paul McCullough (thirty) of Glenalina Road, and twenty-one-year-old Stephen Canning, of Doon Road, who were in the car with Brown, also received twenty-year sentences. \n All three were found guilty of conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to cause an explosion and having a bomb with intent. \n Sentencing the trio to twenty years ' concurrent on each count, Lord Justice MacDermott said the under-car booby-trap device found in the glove compartment of the car was a  \"murderous weapon\"  and that they were guilty of  \"one of the gravest crimes\"  . \n Plagued \n The judge told the attractive blonde actress, who starred alongside pop singer Sinead O'Connor in the film Hush-A-Bye-Baby, that she would be an old woman before she was free. \n  \"At your age you should gave known better than to get involved in terrorism\" , he said.  \"For more than twenty years this province has been plagued by terrorism. \n The sensitivity of everyone has been dulled by repetition but it doesn't mean the activities of terrorists will be tolerated. All right-thinking people abhor such activity\"  . \n Wig \n Earlier, the court had heard how Brown pulled a white hat from her head, dislodging a ginger wig, when the car she was driving was stopped by police, on the Upper Cairncastle Road, outside Larne. \n Apart from giving their names and addresses, the trio refused to answer the police 's questions. \n When the mercury tilt switch device was discovered in the glove compartment, Canning told the RUC:  \"It 's all right, you 're safe, it 's not primed\" . \n The judge said the trio were obviously on their way to murder someone. \n He said they did not try to mitigate their actions by naming their intended target which would have shown  \"remorse and regret\"  . \n Brown, immaculate in a pale green suit and white blouse, sat bolt upright during the short hearing, smiling frequently. \n As she was led away she waved and shouted  \"God bless\"  to family and friends. \n McCullough gave a clenched fist salute and shouted a republican slogan, which was returned by several people in the public gallery. \n The defence counsel said Brown 's seven children were aged from thirteen to twenty-five at the time of her arrest and she had a promising career on stage and screen ahead of her. \n  \"Her life has been changed irrevocably\" , said the barrister.  \"She will spend many years in prison and when she is released she will have to remake her life as best she can\" . \n\n\n<$C>\n 'Room for improvement' admission on weed worry Gail Walker \n Weeds five feet high have turned many grassy areas in east Belfast Housing Executive estates into jungles, it was claimed today. \n DUP councillor Sammy Wilson said that for the second year running he had been swamped with complaints from local people who feel they are living in  \"eyesores\"  . \n View \n And today the Executive admitted it could do better when it came to grounds maintenance in that area of the city. \n  \"It is disgraceful. The Executive obviously has a very serious problem when it comes to looking after these areas,\"  said Mr Wilson. \n  \"One woman told me she used to have a great view from her window across a local park. Now she can't see over the weeds. \n I have contacted the Executive on behalf of people many times and they have told me they will do something about it.  \n Promises \n  \"On some sites I 've had at least four promises since May that work will be carried out. I tell residents this but the work never happens. It makes me look a liar.\"  \n Mr Wilson said that last year the Executive had paid their own direct labour organisation to maintain open spaces  \"but they never cut grass or pulled a single weed.\"  \n  \"They told me that this year they have employed a private contractor who is supposed to cut grass at least twice a month and weed once a month but it 's not happening,\"  he added. \n An Executive spokesman said:  \"The Executive realises there is room for improvement in the grounds maintenance services provided in east Belfast. \n We are actively pursuing the matter with the contractor employed on its behalf to carry out this work.\"  \n Mr Wilson added:  \"When many of the developments were being built tenants associations and public representatives pointed out that publicly-owned areas were prone to vandalism but it was never envisaged they would be subject to such official neglect. \n Senior officials in the Executive have spoken a great deal and written much about delivering a quality service. It is time they started delivering on their promise.\"  \n\n\n<$D>\n Student storm. Drop-out figures are challenged David Watson \n Northern Ireland 's two universities today challenged the latest controversial league table, which shows how the leading UK campuses all perform on students ' failure and drop-out rates. \n Queen 's University came eighteenth out of a list of fifty-six United Kingdom institutions, while the University of Ulster emerged at number thirty-six. \n Crude \n The survey, published in Push, the University Students ' Handbook, showed that only a few percentage points separated both - 10.67pc for Queen 's and 13.71pc for the UU. \n It said that almost one in eight students fail exams or drop out, with Salford University hitting the bottom of the table at 26.4pc. \n Today, a Queen 's spokesman said the figures indicated their record was better than the national average. \n But, he said, they had been described by the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals as  \"very crude and potentially misleading\"  . \n  \"People who fail to finish their course at university do so for all kinds of reasons and we at Queen 's have a large number of welfare procedures and means of assisting students to minimise the failure and drop-out rate,\"  he added. \n The University of Ulster said they concentrated on success and not failure. \n A spokesman said in some courses they had very high pass rates, including 93 per cent in English and history and 91 per cent in education. \n Switched \n The university acknowledged that some technical subjects were more demanding, and new students could find difficulties. But staff looked  \"very carefully\"  at problem areas and examiners were  \"more than happy\"  with their courses, he added. \n The national vice-chancellors committee claimed the table was misleading, as it did not include factors such as students who switched courses. \n Push editor Johnny Rich, said:  \"With flunk rates rising, it has never been more important for prospective students to get the best information when applying.\"  \n He added:  \"Those universities who have consistently been more than mere degree factories can boast a greater level of success at the end of the day. \n These universities realise that when students choose a university, they are choosing more than a course.\"  \n\n\n<$E>\n Troops out, say four in ten English people \n Four out of ten people in England want the troops out of Northern Ireland, a new survey claimed today. \n The Gallup poll found that 39 per cent of those questioned wanted the British Army off the streets of the province. \n Only 35 per cent said the troops should remain. The survey was based on a poll of 1,035 people for market information company Key Note. \n Although the support for the troops in Ulster was low, 59pc felt that UK armed forces should be employed to protect overseas territories such as the Falklands Islands. \n The findings are contained in a new <*> pound sign </*> 350 book entitled \"UK Defence Industry\". \n Other statistics include: \n 48 per cent of those questioned felt the armed forces were good value for money; \n 48 per cent believed British forces should be operating in Bosnia to help end the conflict; \n 34 per cent felt UK forces should be sent to support United Nations operations in Somalia; \n 51 per cent considered the UK 's action in the Gulf war justified; and \n 34 per cent thought national service should be reintroduced for men and women; \n The new reference book will be published next week and is expected to contain 150 pages of information on all aspects of the defence industry. \n\n\n<$F>\n Videotape of Warrington bomb suspects \n Police hunting IRA terrorists who murdered two boys and injured more than 50 people in the Warrington bombing today released video footage of two suspects. \n The black and white film was taken by a shop security camera just 20 minutes before two bombs ripped through the town 's packed shopping centre on March 20. \n It shows two men wearing gloves walking from the direction of the first explosion. They appear to be veering out to cross the road towards the scene of the second blast. \n Questioned \n The camera was set up to cover the interior of the store, and the images of the men, filmed as they walked past on the pavement outside, are not clear. Detectives investigating the explosions have questioned more than 10,000 people but have so far been unable to identify the two men and eliminate them from their inquiries. \n Bombers \n Three year-old Jonathan Ball died almost instantly in the second of the two explosions caused by a bomb hidden a litter bin. Timothy Parry (12) suffered massive injuries and died five days later. \n Cheshire police stressed that they were not saying that the men pictured were the bombers. \n A spokesman said detectives hoped that if the suspects were not the terrorists they - or someone who recognised them - would come forward to eliminate them from the inquiry.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "748db38a-01a1-4842-ad61-0cd523403c2e", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.651711+00:00"}
{"text": "<Business Telegraph>\n\n\n<$A>\n 'Privatisation hikes energy costs' Maurice Neill \n A senior industrialist today attacked rising energy costs and blamed the privatisation of Northern Ireland Electricity. \n Michael McVeigh, works director of the 25-year-old Hoechst chemical plant in Limavady, said the price of power has put new pressure on vulnerable companies. \n The German-based Hoechst reported a massive loss last week and warned of a new round of international cost cutting. \n Neighbouring Du Pont in Londonderry has already trimmed its workforce as recession sweeps the European chemical giants. \n  \"We are struggling to maintain profitability in the middle of a deep recession and yet face a rise in energy costs of as much as 17pc,\"  said Michael McVeigh. \n  \"This kind of increase is simply unacceptable,\"  he added. \n The plant, one of the province 's 20 largest energy consumers, employs 320 producing polyester yarns mainly for the European clothing industry. It pays a power bill of around <*> pound sign </*> 1.25 m a year. \n The Confederation of British Industry here warned Government Northern Ireland already has some of the highest energy costs in Europe but failed to win any safety guarantees pre-privatisation. \n Frank Irvine NIE energy marketing manager said:  \"Excluding rises in fuel costs electricity prices in 1994/95 are expected to rise in line with inflation.\"  \n\n\n<$B>\n 'Bid-peddling' slammed Yvette Shapiro \n RECOVERY in the Northern Ireland construction sector will not occur until tender bids return to  \"realistic\"  levels, a building industry chief warned today. \n Gordon Burnison, director of the Construction Employers Federation in the province, said the organisation 's latest quarterly survey revealed serious concerns about pricing of contracts. \n  \"Tender prices are still too low and, in order for firms to win contracts, they are being forced to offer unrealistic prices.\"  \n In May, the Housing Executive revealed that some firms were building houses at a loss because they were so desperate for business. \n Earlier in the year, the Northern Ireland branch of the Confederation of Specialist Engineering Contractors claimed that  \"bid-peddling\"  was making a mockery of the tendering process and was damaging to the entire construction industry. \n Low pricing is putting pressure on a sector which is currently struggling to climb our of recession, according to the Construction Employers Federation survey which shows workload levels down in almost every area of activity. \n The results are disappointing, since a survey earlier in the year reflected more \"positive trends\" and predicted an improvement in volumes by now. \n  \"Demand has flattened in recent months and the recovery anticipated earlier in the year has not been sustained,\"  said Mr Burnison. \n Unemployment levels, which fell earlier in the year, are now climbing again: around 18,400 construction workers are currently on the dole. \n Despite the current gloomy situation, the Federation is optimistic for the second half of the year. \n\n\n<$C>\n Parker for Babcock \n Harland and Wolff 's outgoing chairman, John Parker, is likely to take over as chief executive of Babcock International, the UK-based engineering company headed by Lord King. \n Announcing Mr Parker 's resignation last week, the shipyard would only say that he was going to join an un-named  \"major international group\"  . \n But weekend newspaper reports, backed up by senior industry sources, suggest that the popular shipyard boss will join Babcock in October. \n The Buckinghamshire-based company builds and equips power stations all over the world and, as a joint venture partner in Babcock-Thorn, manages the Rosyth Dockyard in Scotland on behalf of the Government. \n It is this Rosyth connection which makes Mr Parker an ideal candidate for the top job at Babcock. His success in guiding Belfast Shipyard through privatisation and keeping it afloat during the worst recession in the ship-building trade has won him respect throughout the industry worldwide. \n If his appointment at Babcock is confirmed, Mr Parker will replace Oliver Whitehead, who left the company in May. \n\n\n<$D>\n Words of wisdom - at <*> pound sign </*> 200 a day Robin Morton \n  Several big names are being lined up for the Northern Ireland conference circuit this autumn - and businessmen will pay more than <*> pound sign </*> 200 a day to hear their words of wisdom.  \n Sir John Harvey Jones, the former ICI chairman, known to television audiences for his Troubleshooter series, is to be at the rostrum at the Slieve Donard Hotel in Newcastle next week. \n The man who turned a loss into a <*> pound sign </*> 1bn profit in 30 months will be addressing the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy conference. \n Also addressing the conference will be Sir John Banhanm, the former director general of the Confederation of British Industry, and current chairman of the Local Government Commission for England. \n The three-day CIPFA conference, which starts next Wednesday, is entitled \"Preparing to Win - Northern Ireland in Partnership\". \n Billy Little, CIPFA 's manager in Northern Ireland, said the event would have a wide appeal to those in business, as well as their public sector counterparts. \n The subjects covered will range from the Northern Ireland economy and compulsory competitive tendering to how to manage your bank manager. The aim is to show how the private and public sectors can work in tandem. \n Delegates taking part in the full programme and staying in the hotel are paying <*> pound sign </*> 499 a head, while tickets for the star speaker day (Thursday) are <*> pound sign </*> 235. \n The two Sir Johns will be delivering keynote addresses and then taking part in a question and answer session with delegates. \n CIPFA said the main conference, which includes workshops and training sessions, had attracted more than 300 delegates, and around 400 had booked for the Thursday. \n Meanwhile, plans were unveiled today for the Growing a Green Economy conference at the Balmoral Conference Centre in Belfast on Wednesday October 27. \n The one-day event is the first fruits of the Green Economy Working Group which was set up earlier this year by Robert Atkins. \n The impetus for the conference has come from current reforms in environmental legislation. The speakers will show how the development of the green market can create opportunities for local businesses. \n Speakers will include Jerry Rendell, chief executive of the UK Ecolabelling Board, Shane Molloy, managing director of Lever Ireland, and Hilary Thompson, head of NatWest 's environmental management unit. \n Tickets cost <*> pound sign </*> 75, and Robin Dixon, chairman of the working group, said the event would be a turning point for local business and its understanding of the environmental challenge. \n Also in October, the Training and Employment Agency is organising an afternoon seminar for chief executives on the subject of \"The Virtual Corporation\", an American system whereby companies can develop through subsidiary businesses. \n The event, on Thursday October 14, at the Slieve Donard Hotel, and the main speaker is Dr Roger Nagel from Lehigh University U.S.A. - tickets free. \n\n\n<$E>\n Batting for Northern Ireland \n The Northern Ireland Partnership was set up by the Industrial Development Board in October 1983. Its first co-ordinator was Dr George Chambers, former chief executive of the Milk Marketing Board. \n It is an international voluntary network of 850 business and professional people in Britain, the Continent, the United States, Canada and the Far East. \n Some members are Ulster expatriates who have made the grade overseas. Others are business executives who have associations with the province, perhaps through education or family links. \n The Partnership 's primary aim is to encourage inward investment in the province. But more recently the emphasis has been on improving export potential for companies in the province. \n Another aim is to counter bad publicity for Northern Ireland by emphasising the positive side of the province. \n Members of the partnership have given a helping hand to several industrialists who have been attracted to the province. \n One example is the automotive components plant set up by Ryobi at Carrickfergus. An Ulster academic based in the US urged the head of the Japanese company to consider Northern Ireland as a location. \n Last year, the Belfast based mechanical and electrical engineers Rotary International secured a substantial contract in Japan thanks to a contact made by the Partnership. \n\n\n<$F>\n Sutherland on mission to end talks deadlock Business Telegraph reporter \n World trade negotiator Peter Sutherland is in Paris today in a bid to stop the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement of Tariff and Trade talks slipping backwards to the deadlock of a year ago. \n The Irish diplomat must win new concessions from the hardline French government if he is to meet a deadline for a deal in December. \n The fate of Northern Ireland 's two most important industries, textiles and agriculture, depend on the outcome of the talks, now almost two years behind schedule. \n The textile and clothing industry, which employs 28,000 here, is under renewed pressure from exporters in the developing world and is seeking a new set of rules to be agreed at the GATT table. \n The province 's <*> pound sign </*> 1.5bn agriculture and food industry will be offered new markets if the French will agree to endorse last year 's Blair House agreement cutting subsidies to EC farmers. \n France, Europe 's largest exporter of food, is under pressure from a powerful farm lobby but remains the only obstacle to an agreement on agriculture and GATT progress. \n The Northern Ireland Textiles Association has repeatedly called for a swift conclusion to the talks process to safeguard jobs and businesses here. Uncertainty has thrown a questionmark over investment in both textiles and food processing. \n Said GATT chairman Peter Sutherland:  \"If we don't have a Uruguay Round you can forget talk of a new world order in the post-Iron Curtain Age.\"  \n\n\n<$G>\n Picking a way through the mortgage minefield Anthony Swanston \n  MORTGAGES have always been a minefield, but never more so than now.  \n With constant downward pressure on interest rates lending competition really is hotting up. It is interesting that in Great Britain one of the most aggressive mortgage lenders is Bank of Ireland. \n It is confusing that the deals on offer in Great Britain are not always available here. So let us look at the mortgage opportunities which exist and the points to watch out for. \n 1: By locking into a fixed rate now you may not be absolutely at the bottom of the market, but you cannot be far from it. \n Better to get in too soon than miss out completely - there is always the possibility that between application and completion the rate will reduce again. \n 2: For those running business overdrafts or commercial mortgages which have, typically, higher interest rates, look again at the possibility of shifting all or some of this debt into your domestic mortgage where the rate could be considerably less. \n 3: With Business Expansion Schemes which offer assured exits and projected returns in the region of 14pc, it seems almost crazy not to take a five year fixed loan at under eight per cent to finance the investment. \n 4: The many Northern Ireland people who have foreign loans on foreign properties - Algarve, Dordogne, Donegal, et al - consider now bringing these loans back into the UK secured against your main UK property - if your income is sterling based your debts should also be sterling based. \n Here are some important points to consider when rescheduling debt: \n 1: Be fully aware of the costs of changing your mortgage. There will almost always be a survey fee and some legal fees. \n Obtain a realistic estimate in advance so that you will know what you are in for and therefore be able to calculate the relative merits of changing. \n 2: Many loans, particularly fixed rate loans, carry an arrangement fee. Typically, this arrangement fee is not refundable - so if you change your mind about the whole affair or decide upon a different lender you will almost always lose the fee. \n 3: With repossessions and negative equity (more a feature in Great Britain than in Northern Ireland), lenders are taking a much more conservative view on valuations - the forced sale value of your property may be considerably less than the value you might have hoped for. \n 4: Once your borrowings exceed 75pc if the value of the property, you will probably have to bear the additional cost of a mortgage guarantee policy. \n Premiums \n Premiums vary enormously from lender to lender - adding this to the arrangement fee, survey fee and the legal costs can all mount up to a tidy sum. \n 5: Many loans are conditional upon other services or products being bought from the lending institution - watch out for conditional current accounts, property insurance, contents insurance and endowment policies. \n A good independent financial advisor should be able to present you with an accurate cost benefit analysis of changing your mortgage. \n If in changing the mortgage you are not transacting additional financial services business, such as new endowments or pensions, then you must expect the costs to be increased still further by your adviser 's fee. \n It seems clear that there might be another interest rate cut in the short term (Germans permitting) - it could be a last opportunity to lock in at these levels.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "80e9818b-5ec8-4649-9ce9-dc6d0d0cdd37", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.652775+00:00"}

The ramifications of what 's on the table would be just too far-reaching in terms of what it would cost employees financially,\"  said Mr Irons. \n Stalemate \n The only chink of hope, he said, was the fact the council had accepted the unions ' rejection of what was being offered and their willlingness to meet representatives in a bid to solve the stalemate. Mr Irons, however, refused to discuss exactly what was being offered until further discussions had taken place. \n And David Fallows, Ards Town Clerk, was equally tight-lipped, declining to comment through the Press on  \"industrial relations\"  . \n The package being offered under the CCT regime would affect employees across the board. Ards Borough Council has responsibility for refuse collection and disposal, street cleansing, public toilets, sports halls and leisure centres, swimming pools, burial grounds, parks and open spaces, abattoirs, tourism and cultural facilities. \n  \"In preparation for CCT the council is attempting to undertake a totally different formula for pay and once that 's introduced it will cut across every department,\"  said Mr Irons.  \"The only people it won't affect are probably the Town Clerk and Chief Executive.\"  Mr Irons said there was increasing animosity amongst employees.  \"The workers have absolutely rejected what 's been offered. I can't state that too strongly,\"  he said. \n Strike \n  \"I assume that after we meet with the council there will be a ballot and strike action, I feel, would be a real possibility.\"  \n Mr Irons said Ards was the first council to be so  \"far-reaching\"  in its preparation for CCT. \n  \"The terms being offered to employees are certainly the worst I have ever seen,\" said the official, who has worked with councils across the province in their bids to prepare for competitive tendering for former in-house jobs. \n He claimed that 80 per cent of councils in England retained their contracts without interfering with employees ' conditions. \n  \"Belfast City Council hasn't even touched its pay and conditions,\"  he added. \n\n\n<$B>\n Condemned homes are a drinking den: councillor Helen Carson \n A post-war Comber housing development has become a dumping ground and its empty properties are being used as drinking dens, an Ards councillor has claimed. \n Kathleen Coulter has accused the Housing Executive of failing to meeting deadlines for demolishing the buildings which, she believes, are now in a dangerous condition. \n Vandals are intent on the  \"wholesale destruction\"  of the estate, claimed the councillor, who said local pensioners were becoming  \"virtual prisoners\"  in their homes because they were too scared to go out. \n The Orlit developments, as the houses are commonly known, were erected after the Second World War as a short-term solution to chronic housing shortages. \n But in recent years an order passed by Parliament put the onus on the Housing Executive to demolish such housing, as it had long passed its intended lifespan. \n Councillor Kathleen Coulter claimed:  \"The Housing Executive has made countless promises. It has told us the properties will be knocked down in October - but we have heard this so many times before.\"  \n Thugs \n With so many vacant properties, thugs have gone on a wrecking spree in the development, destroying everything in their wake, the councillor told the  Herald and Post.  \n  \"They also hold drinking parties in the empty properties,\"  she claimed. \n The councillor added that remaining residents, who are mostly elderly, are desperate to be rehoused, as they have become virtual prisoners in their homes. \n  \"People in the area are just too scared to go out.\"  \n Ards Borough Council has demanded that the Housing Executive demolish the old houses this month. \n And Mrs Coulter explained the housing development was being replaced by five different phases, with the first two complete. \n  \"One woman moved out on a Friday and by Monday the flat was stripped,\"  she said. \n <# > Mrs Coulter said the devastation included: <*> bullet point </*> Slates and tiles ripped from roofs. <*> bullet point </*> Fixtures, such as toilets, smashed. <*> bullet point </*> Doors and windows broken. <*> bullet point </*> Stairways destroyed. \n  \"The vandals are moving into the houses as quickly as the people are moving out,\"  added Mrs Coulter. \n The Housing Executive has assured Ards Borough Council that it has secured the properties, but Mrs Coulter says the thugs simply break in again. \n She stressed that people caught damaging property in this way could be prosecuted, and she urged anyone who knew anything to get in touch with the police. \n  \"They cannot be allowed to get away with this,\"  added the councillor. \n Mrs Coulter added that the technical services department of the Housing Executive  \"should feel obliged to do a tidy up and clear weeds in the area\"  . \n\n\n<$C>\n Disabled losing out to taxis? Caroline Cooper \n Even taxis have more parking spaces than disabled drivers in Bangor town centre, it was claimed this week. \n Bangor resident Tom O'Brien said that he was  \"deeply concerned\"  by the lack of adequate disabled persons ' parking spaces in the town and, in particular, at the top of Main Street. \n A disabled driver, Mr O'Brien, from Glastry Gardens in Kilcooley estate, was responding to a recent report in the  Herald and Post  which outlined a Bangor mother 's concern at  \"nuisance\"  disabled drivers. \n She claimed they were  \"causing havoc\"  in the town centre. \n  \"What I would like to ask this woman, and anyone else who may agree with her, is where are disabled people supposed to park, when from Abbey Street to Lower Main Street there are just four spaces for disabled people?\"  he asked. \n Disabled \n With around 7,000 disabled people in North Down and Ards area, the Bangor man said it was a  \"disgrace\"  there were only four disabled spaces in the immediate town centre.  \"If I want to go into Bangor on a Saturday, the only parking spaces for the disabled are at the bottom of Main Street near to H Samuel 's. There 's just no way I could walk up the hill to the top of the street with my disability,\"  said Mr O'Brien. \n  \"There are disabled spaces in the car park at the marina. That is all very well, but it is even further away and impossible for me, and many other people like me, to walk that distance,\"  he added. \n Taxis, the Bangor man claimed, currently have more room to park than disabled drivers. \n  \"Where 's the justice in that?\"  asked Mr O'Brien. \n The Orange Badge holder said he and many others like him were becoming increasingly anxious about the  \"misuse\"  of disabled spaces. \n  \"It infuriates me when even these few precious disabled parking spaces are taken up by fully able-bodied people who would be perfectly capable of parking further away and walking into the centre. \n \"Ideally, what I would like to see is the spaces on one side of the street at the top half of Main Street designated for disabled drivers, allowing them to park and shop with ease,\"  he suggested. \n It is understood the Department of Environment is currently monitoring the use of disabled parking spaces within the town, following the introduction of the one-way system in May 1992. \n\n\n<$D>\n Health Unit slammed for 'cutting corners' \n North Down and Ards Community Unit has been accused of  \"cutting corners\"  in providing health care in the community. \n Outraged by the local health unit 's decision to withdraw home helps from preparing meals for hundreds of disabled and elderly people, Alliance 's Siobhan Laird attacked the government 's entire community care programme. \n  \"When the government first proposed moving people from institutional care into the community, a government committee appeared to investigate this matter and reported in 1988, warning that  'care in the community is not a cheap option' ,\" said Ms Laird. \n And she insisted the government has done the reverse by  \"treating it as a cheap option\"  . \n  \"The government has consistently tried to sell us community care as a product which will enhance the quality of life and broaden the choices of coping with physical or mental disability,\"  she said. \n Service \n  \"I believe in Bangor such conservative policies have resulted in elderly and disabled people being increasingly abandoned into the community. These policies are stifling choice,\"  added Ms Laird. \n Attacking North Down and Ards Community Unit, the Alliance member said no-one would be fooled by assurances that a new meals-on-wheels service, which is replacing the meals service currently provided by home helps, would lead to quality enhancement. \n  \"The unit assures us that the decision to have frozen meals delivered to disabled and elderly people, instead of having them prepared in the person 's house by a home help, is not a money saving measure,\"  she said. \n  \"Do they think we are all stupid enough to swallow that one? Of course this new policy is about cutting cost because it is about cutting corners in personal care. As a community we must oppose it,\"  concluded Ms Laird. \n It is understood the North Down and Ards Unit may introduce the new meals-on-wheels system within the next few months. \n However it is believed a small number may still be provided with a home\nhelp at meal times and will not be part of the new scheme. \n Under the new system, clients will be issued with a menu card at the beginning of each week and will be asked to pick the meals they wish to eat. \n These will then be collected by an outside catering firm and delivered by a female driver to individual homes. \n The food will then be heated up by the elderly and disabled clients themselves. \n Each meal will cost the individual <*> pound sign </*> 1. \n\n\n<$E>\n 'Journey in Understanding' \n A 'JOURNEY in Understanding' will begin at Belfast 's YMCA later this month. \n The programme of the same name will promote growth in mutual understanding and cross community awareness between Protestant and Catholic communities. \n The 10-week series of group workshops, bringing together people from diverse backgrounds, begins on Monday September 27. \n City YMCA cross-community co-ordinator David Porter believes the programme is an opportunity for people to meet, develop friendships and awareness of the issues which both divide and unite them. \n  \"It 's the start of a journey in which all are committed to grow in respect and acceptance of others in order to live and work together in the city,\"  he said. \n The course costs <*> pound sign </*> 15, or <*> pound sign </*> 5 for senior citizens, students and the unemployed. \n Each series in the Journey of Understanding is limited to a maximum of 16 adults made up of equal numbers from both communities. \n Participants will also have the chance to go on a residential weekend. \n\n\n<$F>\n I love ya, tomorrow \n Two young Belfast girls have been given the chance to play one of the most sought after theatre roles of them all. \n Gillian Smith (10) and Denise Farrelly (13) will be playing the coveted part of little orphan Annie in the Arts Musical Youth 's new production which opens on Tuesday. \n The show, directed by Peter Kennedy, runs until Sunday evening at the Botanic Avenue theatre. \n Meanwhile, at the Old Museum Arts Centre, the Armada Festival begins on Monday with the first of six productions by young Irish companies.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6b9107d3-5491-4325-b319-5cdc22957253", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.653760+00:00"}
{"text": "<Sunday Life 2>\n\n\n<$A>\n UDA STEAL JAIL KEYS Alan Murray \n Security at Crumlin Road prison in Belfast was in chaos last night after loyalists smuggled a set of prison keys out of the jail. \n The major security lapse revealed to Sunday Life yesterday adds a further dangerous dimension to the already grim picture in the province 's jail system. \n The four keys on a copper ring are believed to have been lost by a warder in the jail which loyalist sources say is tense because of rumours that a quantity of Semtex was found in B wing a month ago. \n In a written communication smuggled out of the jail by UDA prisoners along with the keys, they claim they are  \"sacrificial sheep\"  in a security game being played by the authorities to try and trap IRA bombers. \n They allege that there have been constant movements of IRA remand prisoners over the last four weeks because of the fear that  \"further\"  quantities of the deadly explosive are in the jail. \n And they fear an explosion similar to the blast in November 1991 which killed two loyalist prisoners in a dining room is being planned by republicans. \n The prisoners say in the smuggled letter that they want the suspected IRA bombers to be put in specially built cells. \n  \"Isolate these men and call in the RUC to investigate\"  , they demand. \n They claim that Semtex and what they say was a  \"firing pack\"  was found in B wing over three weeks ago and that the set of keys was lost by a warder during searches. \n They say some Republicans were put into cells with hidden microphones of eavesdropping purposes in a bid to discover where other quantities of explosives were hidden. \n When it was discovered the keys had been lost, major searches of B wing were launched but the keys were successfully concealed by prisoners. \n  \"If they can't find a bunch of keys, what chance have they of finding Semtex\",  the smuggled letter asks. \n A spokesperson for the Northern Ireland Office confirmed that a set of keys was lost in the jail and had not been found. \n  \"Appropriate action has been taken to ensure the lost keys are no longer of any use\".  \n The prison authorities denied that any Semtex has been found in the jail in recent weeks. \n\n\n<$A>\n RACKETEERING SQUAD TARGET McGUINNESS Alan Murray \n Top republican Martin McGuinness will not face prosecution on the sole basis of material supplied to the RUC by the recent Cook Report programme. \n A senior RUC officer at Police Headquarters in Belfast has indicated that the material would not suffice as evidence in a criminal prosecution. \n However a major investigation into the activities of the top republican is being conducted by a team of detectives from the RUC's C13 anti-racketeering unit. \n The Chief Superintendent in charge of the unit and detectives from his squad are documenting all the Cook Report material on computers and assembling other details as part of a major investigation ordered by the Chief Constable. \n Sir Hugh Annesley and his senior officers are concerned at the public perception created by the programme that an all-out effort is not being made to prosecute the so-called godfathers of terrorism in both the loyalist and nationalist camps. \n Under the new Northern Ireland Emergency Provisions Act a new offence of directing terrorism at any level with life imprisonment as the maximum penalty is included. It is understood no person has yet been charged with the offence. \n The RUC Press Office declined to say whether anyone has been charged with the offence since the Act came into force two years ago. \n One senior RUC officer has explained that even if some of the witnesses interviewed by Roger Cook 's researchers were prepared to appear in a criminal trial their own terrorist backgrounds would undermine the credibility of their testimony. \n While the top Derry republican is said to be livid about the content of the programme, there is little expectation at Police Headquarters that Cook 's material alone will provide the basis for a file that might be forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions in the future. \n\n\n<$A>\n UFF STEPS UP TERROR CAMPAIGN Alan Murray \n Security sources believe that the UFF managed to locate the new safe house of the IRA 's top man in North Belfast within just six weeks. \n The house was attacked and another IRA activist escaped without injury.\nThe ability of the loyalist terrorists to track down the location is an illustration of how much better their intelligence on the IRA has become. \n Homework \n A Special Branch Officer said:  \"It shows they are driving around nationalist areas, consulting electoral register records and basically doing their homework.\"  \n Uncovering the IRA man 's safe house, detectives believe, was basically a case of watching car movements. \n  \"We 're certain the UFF identifies a car used by the target, then they drive through nationalist areas in the city late at night looking for the car. \n \"If they locate it outside a house, then they establish when it is there, and prepare and attack for the period.\"  \n Police say that one well known UFF figure is regularly driving through nationalist parts of North and West Belfast despite the real risk to his own life. \n An RUC officer said:  \"He is regularly stopped at road checks by our patrols. He even points at houses and tells uniformed officers  'That 's where so and so lives'  . \n \"He really is constantly targeting the homes of IRA figures, but we can't prove that in court.\"  \n Such is the geography of the area that a top UFF man in the Shankill and the IRA 's top man in North Belfast recently became involved in a heated verbal exchange in a bizarre incident while stopped in cars at traffic lights on the Crumlin Road. \n Screaming \n One RUC officer said:  \"If you wrote that into a play or novel, people wouldn't believe it, but it actually happened. Here were these two sworn enemies screaming at each other through car windows. \n \"It 's indicative of a seething hatred and the proximity of loyalist and nationalist areas which enables the killer gangs to drive into one another 's area in a minute and get back whether they are scouting or going in to murder.\"  \n\n\n<$B>\n Armagh 's drinkers face dry weekend \n Publicans in the south Armagh village of Crossmaglen had their busiest weekend of the year put in jeopardy when a lorry delivering <*> pound sign </*> 20,000 of drink was hijacked on Friday. \n The lorry was bringing the drink for the Crossmaglen Traditional Weekend, an annual even of music and drinking, which attracts thousands to the village. \n The publicans are now anxiously looking at their stocks to see whether they can manage without the 160 barrels stolen in a daylight raid at Silverbridge, near the border village. \n Although Sunday is one of the quieter days of the festival, pubs with extra stock have agreed to help out any who run into difficulties. \n Joe Pilkington, the owner of The Cartwheel, one of the largest pubs in the village, said that it was difficult to predict sales but thought he had enough to last the final night. \n  \"If I don't, I wouldn't like to see the faces of the people around here if I tried to ration it,\"  he said. \n\n\n<$C>\n RTE bosses plan soccer blockbuster John Moore \n TV bosses are planning to set Ireland alight with World Cup football fever. As the Republic seems set to qualify for America, they are drawing up plans for the biggest television sports blockbusters ever. \n <*> bullet point </*> One of the Republic's two TV channels, Network 2, will be completely turned over to football and fans for the Cup, showing an incredible 50 live matches. <*> bullet point </*> There will be six major TV spectaculars in the run-up to the contest, and <*> bullet point </*> A special camera unit will be based with the Irish team to bring fans the inside stories. \n The decision to turn the Cup into a huge entertainment event has been made because of the massive fan following which Jack Charlton and his Green Army have built up in their battle to quality. \n The man in charge of the RTE operation is sports broadcasting chief Tim O'Connor. \n He revealed:  \"We are seriously looking at the possibility of taking over Network 2 for the World Cup. \n \"We plan to screen live 50 out of the 52 matches which will be played during the competition. \n \"We will be able to do this because, for the first time in a World Cup, it seems there will be three different kick-off times each day with all three daily matches being staggered. \n \"That 's why it makes sense to turn Network 2 into Ireland 's soccer channel.\"  \n But RTE chiefs have ordered that TV coverage should also take in other topics.\n \"There will be a special magazine programme on what 's happening behind the scenes,\"  said Tim. \n  \"And, in the six shows in the run-up to the Cup, we will be dealing with things such as security and personal safety for fans, as well as entertainment and what to do in America.\"  \n The Republic faces its next World Cup qualifying hurdle in Dublin on Wednesday when it plays Lithuania. \n Northern Ireland are all but out of the competition, needing a miracle to make it to the US, Scotland are already out and Wales are still in with a chance. \n England are in danger of failing to qualify and begin a three-match trail of truth on Wednesday against Poland. \n\n\n<$D>\n RUC left in the dark \n Police officers serving in the toughest loyalist areas of Belfast admit they are not making big inroads into the terrorist organisations. \n As the activities of the three loyalist terrorist groups claimed four lives last week, experienced police officers said they now faced structures as tight as any IRA cells. \n One detective who has interviewed many loyalist activists at Castlereagh said:  \"Usually when you got four Prods in, one spilled some of the beans and that enabled you to get at the others. It 's not happening like that now. \n And one uniformed officer who patrols the area said:  \"Headquarters won't admit it, but they aren't giving us any good grade intelligence on the UDA/UFF crowd, because the Branch just isn't getting it. \n \"We 've got five or six UVF teams with their gear in the last year, but only one UFF team.\"  \n The officer said there had been no significant finds of UFF weapons on the Shankill in the last 12 months. \n Searches \n  \"The intelligence isn't there. We even suspect they have made hides in the foundations of new houses, because they 're using guns and we 're not getting them later in searches,\"  the officer said. \n The Red Hand Commando, revived after lying dormant for eight years, is much further down the Special Branch 's priority list, despite its terror campaign against the GAA and attacks on Catholics recently in North Belfast. \n One Special Branch officer said  \"The UFF is by far the greatest danger because it is expanding, and its internal security is very, very tight. \n \"The UVF we have penetrated well, as arrests in Belfast and Mid Ulster have shown, but the Red Hand is small and that makes it more difficult to infiltrate.\"  \n The officer said that type of harrowing loyalist murders of last week were virtually unstoppable. \n  \"If we don't have intelligence we can't prevent these atrocities. And the more quickly they are organised, the less time we have to act even if we do get a hint,\"  he said. \n\n\n<$E>\n CHAMPS CAN RETAIN TITLE Micheal McGeary \n All Ireland champions Kilkenny put their title on the line this afternoon against a Galway side desperately keen to revive the glory days of the late 80s. \n The influence of Kilkenny and Galway hurling is reflected in the fact that they have qualified for three finals, minor, U-21 and senior. \n Kilkenny could have been beaten in the Leinster championship but for a controversial penalty, awarded after John Power went down in the square. \n Wexford too had chances to beat them, in the Leinster final and in the replay, but let them off the hook. \n In fairness against Offaly they were short three players, with three again missing against Wexford. \n There is, however, a tremendous    camaraderie   and resilience within the squad. \n They are great survivors who simply never countenance defeat. \n Both sides have an average age of 25. \n The intensity and urgency of Galway 's hurling in the semi-final win over Tipperary surprised most people. \n There is though a real danger that Galway may have already played their All Ireland final, and that after their sterling endeavours against Tipperary they won't have sufficient left in the tank. \n Seldom has a team been so fired up prior to a major match, due largely to the pompous comments of Tipperary manager Babs Keating, who should have known better. \n Even the three debutants came in and played like never before. \n Galway will still go in as underdogs - an unusual position for them - but one that should suit them down to the ground. \n Attack \n The fact they are playing Kilkenny won't make them feel intimidated or fazed in any way. \n Tradition is no longer against them. \n They have beaten all the top hurling powers at various stages in the last decade. \n Attack is obviously Galway 's biggest concern. \n They won against Tipperary without ever putting away all the chances they created. \n Pauric Kelly, Murt Killea and Joe McGrath are under pressure to again reproduce their heroics of the semi-final win. \n Michael McGrath, Joe Cooney, Michael Phelan, so there 's a huge responsibility on the shoulders of Michael Coleman. \n Galway 's revival is no overnight success. \n It 's all down to hard work at ever level of the sport, but anytime Kilkenny get to a final they expect to win. \n The champions have tremendous belief in their own ability, and while it 's premature to compare them with the great Kilkenny sides they look well enough equipped to retain their title.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "1fd6fa1d-a7b4-4be3-ab39-11e19df85b7d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.654710+00:00"}
{"text": "<Irish Times 1>\n\n\n<$A>\n  Financial regulator proposal for Cabinet tomorrow \n  New body planned to operate separately from Central Bank  \n By Jane Suiter,\nEconomics Correspondent  \n THE Cabinet is to be asked tomorrow to establish a new independent regulator to police the financial services sector. The plan is part of a response to the controversy in the financial sector, most recently at Allied Irish Banks. \n The T&/anaiste, Ms Harney, and the Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, are jointly tabling the proposals. They agree that a new regulatory body should be established, separate from the Central Bank, to supervise the banks and other financial institutions. \n Although on the drawing board for some months, the process is being speeded up as a direct response to the latest financial controversy which has erupted over AIB and the inquiry into its handling of DIRT tax liabilities. \n Senior ministers have expressed concern that the current regulatory structure is not equipped to deal with such situations. It is understood that Ms Harney and Mr McCreevy want to move swiftly to offset criticism of the Central Bank. \n The Central Bank has said that its primary role is to oversee the overall health of the financial system. It is expected that the new body will be asked to focus much more directly on consumer protection and on the proper running of the financial institutions. \n The presentation of the joint proposal means that Cabinet approval for the new regulator is practically guaranteed. \n It is the result of the conclusions of a joint working group between the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the Department of Finance, which was set up earlier this year. But it will be next year before the new authority is set up. \n If approved by Cabinet, it will be a severe setback for the Central Bank. The bank is already to lose its monetary policy decision-making functions as part of the move to the single currency and the supervisory side of its role has been the fastest growing part of its brief for some time. \n When he appeared before the D&/ail Committee of Public Accounts last week, the bank 's governor, Mr Maurice O'Connell, said the bank could see the logic of bringing the regulation of the insurance sector into the same organisation as the banks. \n However he insisted that there was no point in bringing taxation supervision into the same body, saying such a move had not worked anywhere in the world. \n Mr O'Connell also admitted it was necessary for consumer protection to take on a more clearly defined and transparent role. He said the bank would be prepared to take on such a role if legislation was changed. \n Speaking on RT&/E Radio 's  This Week  programme yesterday, Mr McCreevy said the bank was not at fault in the AIB affair and insisted it had done an excellent job within its remit of prudential regulation.\n The bank has been in charge of banking supervision since 1971, but in recent years significant extra responsibility has come its way through the regulation of the IFSC, the Stock Exchange as well as investment intermediaries. \n Meanwhile the D&/ail Committee of Public Accounts continues its investigation of the AIB affair this week and is to have a conference of its legal advisers along with those of the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr John Purcell, today, to consider its next steps. \n AIB 's former group internal auditor, Mr Anthony Spollen, is among the witnesses who have been invited to appear before the committee and is likely to appear shortly. He will defend his estimate that the bank 's outstanding DIRT tax liability was around <*> pound sign </*> 100 million. Mr Spollen may also tell the committee about criticisms of the bank 's handling of the non-resident account issue and other issues, contained in a lengthy memo which he submitted to the bank 's audit committee in 1991. \n Another former senior executive, Mr Jimmy O'Mahony, group head of taxation, was quoted by AIB executives as saying that the <*> pound sign </*> 100 million estimates \u00d0 derived from figures which he originated \u00d0 were off-the-cuff figures designed to get the attention of other managers. He has also been invited to appear before the committee. \n\n\n<$B>\n  Spanish judges prepare to fly to London to question Pinochet  \n From Rachel Donnelly, in London \n THE former Chilean dictator, Gen Augusto Pinochet, remains under armed guard at a London hospital today awaiting the arrival of two Spanish judges who will question him about alleged genocide and state-sponsored terrorism during his 17-years in power.\n Gen Pinochet (82) was arrested on Friday night by the Metropolitan Police on an international warrant, following a request by Judge Baltasar Garz&/on and Judge Manuel Garc&/ia Castell&/on. They are investigating the murder of up to 3,000 people and the disappearance of 1,000 more in Chile between 1973 and 1983. The arrest warrant alleges that between September 1973 and December 1983 he  \"did murder Spanish citizens in Chile within the jurisdiction of the government of Spain\". \n The Chilean government accused Britain of wrongfully arresting their former leader because, as a senator, Gen Pinochet was travelling on a diplomatic passport and could claim diplomatic immunity. The Foreign Office rejected this yesterday. \n The Chilean president, Mr Eduardo Frei, a Christian Democrat, said yesterday that Spanish courts had no more right to try Gen Pinochet than Chilean judges would have to delve into crimes under the former Spanish dictator, Gen Franco. His foreign minister, Mr Jos&/e Miguel Insulza, a Socialist, lodged a formal complaint with his British counterpart.\n But other leading members of both coalition parties in Chile said that diplomatic immunity did not protect Gen Pinochet from being questioned about crimes against humanity.\n The Shadow Foreign Secretary, Mr Michael Howard, said he was worried that Gen Pinochet 's arrest was not a result of normal legal procedures but had come about because of pressure from lobby groups and Labour MPs. During the previous Conservative government, Gen Pinochet was a regular visitor to Britain.\n\n\n<$C >\n<$D>\n  Dublin street clashes between gardai and supporters of SF\nBy Jim Cusack and Maol Muire Tynan  \n BANDSMEN taking part in a Sinn F&/ein demonstration marched through the centre of Dublin yesterday chanting  \"I..I..IRA\". \n There were ugly confrontations in the city centre between garda&/i and Sinn F&/ein supporters on a number of occasions over the weekend following Sinn F&/ein Youth 's national congress in Dublin on Saturday.\n Garda&/i were called to Middle Abbey Street on Saturday afternoon after a large group of young men leaving the congress gathered around an unmarked Garda car and began rocking it and kicking it, garda&/i said. It is believed the car contained two Special Branch officers who had been monitoring the event. \n Uniformed garda&/i from Store Street station came to the assistance of the two plain-clothes officers and dispersed the crowd without any arrests.\n According to the Garda, some people attending the congress were involved in incidents later.\n It is understood a disturbance broke out after two uniformed garda&/i attempting to arrest a man who was urinating in a shop doorway on O'Connell Street at around midnight, were surrounded by a crowd.\n More garda&/i were called from Store Street station to assist the officers in O'Connell Street. Nine men, including two from Northern Ireland, were arrested and brought to the station, where they were charged with public order offences and released without surety.\n It is expected all will receive summonses for the offences and will appear before the District Court.\n After yesterday 's march through the city centre, a large group protested outside Store Street station about the arrest of the nine men. Scuffles broke out between garda&/i and members of Sinn F&/ein Youth but no further arrests were made.\n The protestors claimed that garda&/i had harrassed Sinn F&/ein Youth members after their congress on Saturday. Chanting loudly, they sat on the steps of the Garda station and scuffles followed as garda&/i set about removing them.\n The disturbances, however, lasted just minutes as Garda reinforcements moved in and Sinn F&/ein officials appealed for calm and urged the crowd to disperse peacefully.\n About 500 people marched in yesterday 's demonstration from Parnell Square to Kildare Street, and back. Five flute and drum bands from Northern Ireland, three dressed in combat uniforms and black berets, took part in the demonstration and played republican party tunes.\n It was led by a group of recently-released IRA prisoners.\n The bands were among a large contingent who travelled to Dublin yesterday morning on a chartered train from Belfast.\n The demonstration was also attended by Sinn F&/ein figures and a delegation from the political wing of the Basque separatist organisation ETA.\n\n\n<$E>\n  Dempsey presses for Budget to include a range of  'green taxation' measures  \n By Frank McDonald, Environment Correspondent \n THE Minister for the Environment, Mr Dempsey, is pressing the Government to intorduce a range of  \"green taxation\"  measures in the Budget, including a benefit-in-kind tax on free off-street car-parking spaces in Dublin and other cities.\n  \"I am particularly concerned to support the complementary measures proposed by the Dublin Transportation Office (DTO) to deal with the traffic problem and that includes taxing parking spaces as well as providing incentives for 'park-and-ride' facilities.\"  \n Mr Dempsey told  The Irish Times  that he was also in favour of a carbon energy tax to help Ireland meet its commitment under the Kyoto Protocol to cap the increase in greenhouse gas emissions at 13 per cent above their 1990 levels by the year 2010.\n  \"We have to seriously engage on this issue because it 's not something that will go away,\"  he said.  \"And while we must keep an eye on the competitiveness and Irish industry, I 've come to the conclusion in recent months that a carbon tax is unavoidable.\"  \n However, the Minister accepts that there is no possibility of taking such a radical step in time for the Budget on December 2nd.  \"What I 'm trying to do is to work towards a greening of the tax system that would take account of our legally binding obligations.\" \n For the past three years, green taxation has been under consideration by an inter-departmental committee, which includes the Department of the Environment and the Department of finance. However, little progress has been made on the issue. \n According to sources, the committee meets on a regular basis in the two or three months before a Budget. Various ideas for reform are put forward and noted by the Department of Finance, which then says there is not enough time to do anything about implementing them. \n As a result, recent Budgets have contained little more than token gestures towards green taxation \u00d0 such as the tax differential in the price of unleaded petrol \u00d0 with little sign of movement towards a more comprehensive, environmentally-minded approach.\n It is understood that Mr Dempsey accepted the argument that major changes could not be made in last year 's Budget on the understanding that the issue would be seriously tackled this year. But continuing procrastination by the Department of Finance has made this impossible. \n In recent weeks, senior officials of the Department of the Environment have detected a change in the attitude of their counterparts in Finance \u00d0 not because of an conversion to environmental concerns but because they are beginning to see green taxes as a useful tool. \n This may be linked to the wider macro-economic pictures of the inflationary pressures that would be created if too much money is let into the economy as a result of tax breaks. Thus, they may see green taxes as a mechanism to claw back some of it.\n It is also understood that the Revenue Commissioners have shifted their position about raising concerns over the difficulties of collecting such taxes and are planning to talk to the DTO about how fiscal measures could assist in implementing its action plan.\n Apart from imposing benefit-in-kind tax on off-street car-parking spaces, Mr Dempsey favours replacing the current incentives for the construction of multi-storey car-parks with a new scheme which would provide tax breaks for the provision of peripheral \"park-and-ride\" sites.\n He is also believed to be pressing for major changes in vehicle registration tax (VRT), so that a higher rate would be levied on larger, less energy-efficient cars. The aim would be to  \"send out a signal\" that the issue of green taxation was being treated seriously.\n In the longer term, the minister in urging his Cabinet colleagues to look at fiscal measures to support his recently unveiled national waste management plan, including the imposition of a landfill tax which would be paid by all waste producers \u00d0 including households. \n On the issue of a carbon energy tax, Mr Dempsey believes that doing nothing is no longer possible, even though there is bound to be strong opposition from the ESB and industrial high-energy users, such as Irish Cement, as well as from other Government departments.\n All of these interests are making submissions on the issue as part of a consultation process on the formulation of a greenhouse gas abatement strategy for Ireland, culminating in a consultative conference involving all parties \u00d0 including environmental groups \u00d0 on October 28th.\n This conference is likely to renew the focus on environmental taxes in the context of the 13 per cent cap agreed by Mr Dempsey as part of the EU burden-sharing arrangement reached in Luxembourg last June under which each member-state must achieve a specified target.\n Ireland has already attracted strong criticism from EU sources over the previous Government 's decision to abolish water charges, because this is diametrically opposed to environmental principles. But short of a directive from Brussels, the charges are unlikely to be reintroduced.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c2f9bb88-2de9-48c7-b54e-4d69241eeb5e", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.655912+00:00"}
{"text": "<Irish Times 2>\n\n\n<W2C-12$A>\n  FF left in the doldrums as other parties discuss rainbow coalition \n By Maol Muire Tynan, Political Reporter  \n DISCUSSIONS on the formation of a rainbow coalition are well under way between the leaders of all the politcal parties in Leinster House except Fianna Fail, with a view to establishing an alternative administration within days. \n It has emerged that the issue of a rotating Taoiseach will not be a major sticking point with the Labour leadership. Fine Gael insistence that Mr John Bruton should take up the position in a new government will not prevent Mr Dick Spring agreeing to join a rainbow coalition. \n Mr Bruton said last night he believed that a new government could be formed  \"within days\"  as a political vacuum had prevailed since the Cork by-elections last month and there were pressing political issues at stake. \n Much groundwork had already been done by the different parties in terms of their requirements in an alternative administration, he said, but he declined to speculate on whether the rainbow coalition was likely to consist of a three- or four-party alliance. \n In order to advance the talks rapidly, a second round of contacts between the party leaders took place last night. \n Before the start of the special Dail statements on the Brendan Smyth controversy, Mr Bruton had a 45-minute meeting with Mr Spring in his offices and also held discussions with the leader of the Progressive Democrats, Ms Mary Harney, and the leader of Democratic Left, Mr Proinsias de Rossa. \n Separate talks on the formation of an alliance also took place between Mr Spring and the leaders of the smaller parties yesterday afternoon, and position papers have already been exchanged between some of the parties. \n According to some Labour sources, Mr Spring is  \"anxious not to exclude anyone at this stage\"  , and it is understood he believes that a coalition can be crafted within a very short period. The renegotiated programme for government that Labour had almost concluded with Fianna Fail will form the basis of its talks with the rainbow parties. \n Indicating that her party was willing to play a role in attempting to form a government, Ms Harney stressed that the new coalition must be  \"credible, durable and effective\"  . Sources in the party said last night that policy considerations would dictate whether the Progressive Democrats could participate in a coalition. \n Warning that his party would not be  \"bounced\"  into a coalition, Mr Pat Rabbitte of Democratic Left said the issues had to be carefully considered. Politicians in Leinster House said they believed the new administration would ultimately consist of a three-party government since such an arrangement provided more Cabinet seats for each party and meant fewer complications in policy implementation. \n It is understood that Labour would prefer to see Democratic Left accompany it in a new alliance, and while Fine Gael would favour the PDs it would also find Democratic Left acceptable. \n In the carve-up of Cabinet seats, both the Progressive Democrats and Democratic Left would fight for two seats.\n\n\n<$B>\n  At times it was like a show trial \nBy Joe Carroll \n THE Fianna Fail faces told it all. The once sleek, confident Ministers slumped in their seats. The backbenchers seemed dazed as Albert and Bertie gave at times weird versions of who said what to whom and when.\n The new Attorney General whose researchers are turning over forgetful Ministers and officials with clinical efficiency, was not in the chamber. But his version of what he found on the famous Monday, when Albert and his Ministers put together the speech which never mentioned the Duggan case and brought down the Government, is amazing. \n Pat Rabbitte interjected that it sounded like a  \"psychiatric report\"  .\n As the AG put it, the Fianna Fail Ministers that day  \"were behaving in a very disorganised manner. No-one appeared to be in charge...Ministers came in and out at will. The confession was added to by the manifest tiredness of all concerned. I am informed that this was due to long hours without sleep.\" \n The following night they were at it again in the small hours drafting Albert 's gut-Harry-Whelehan speech. The AG was summoned from his bed at 3 a.m. The sight he saw at that time he passes over in merciful silence.\n Albert seemed offended that it was reported that the AG  \"paid a private visit to my apartment in Ballsbridge to apprise me of the Duggan case. I wish to state categorically that the Attorney General never set foot in my apartment.\"  One wonders if he ever will. \n One after the other Fianna Fail Ministers stood up to account for their movements on the famous Monday. Michael Woods had the best alibi, although he did at one stage actually see the AG at the  \"loose, ad-hoc meeting\"  .\n Bertie had to sit beside Albert when he gave the fatal speech and hand over  \"appropriate replies\"  , but  \"it was not my function to read them or analyse them. Just hand them over\"  . \n It was not a pretty sight to see these once self-assured Ministers acting at times as if they were the already-doomed victims at a Stalinist show trial, while their contemptuous accusers toyed with and taunted them. \n Even Dick Spring, the Grand Inquisitor, was sorry for them.  \"We all make mistakes and none of us are more than human\"  but  \"it is time for those involved to step aside\"  , he said chillingly. It was an eerie echo of the invitation of a former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, to some other victims of circumstances to  \"stand aside\" .\n Dick regretted  \"this sad end to what I believe was a potentially exciting development in Irish politics\"  . But he could not  \"proceed with negotiations with Fianna Fail in good faith\"  after the  Irish Times  report was seen to be  \"essentially true\"  .\n Today there will be further interrogations of the luckless Ministers before a Dail committee. But Dick has seen to it that they are yesterday 's men.\n Bertie, the man who would be Taoiseach, sadly listed all the  \"mistakes\"  Fianna Fail had made over Harry Whelehan and the sequel to his appointment.  \"We have paid the price for those mistakes...but our conscience is clear.\"  Now they will  \"willingly accept the people 's verdict\"  . But it is Dick 's verdict which counts. \n\n\n<$C>\n  Cover-up by senior FF Ministers, says Harney  \n THERE was a cover-up by senior Fianna Fail Ministers, the leader of the Progressive Democrats, Ms Mary Harney told the House. Whichever Minister was    responsible   for the handwritten note attached to the supplementary reply on the Duggan case  \"knew exactly its significance\"  , she said.\n  \"They were anxious that the Taoiseach should not deviate because they knew that an unscripted Albert Reynolds would let them all down\"  . Quoting the handwritten note -  \"If pressed on this question keep repeating the above\"  - Ms Harney said she had repeatedly asked who was the Minister who had written it. It was  \"a laugh\"  that Fianna Fail, which had done so much to discredit the judiciary, was proposing to appoint a judge to inquire into its own behaviour. \n She said that other questions had not been answered. Why had the Attorney General, Mr Eoghan Fitzsimons, felt obliged in his letter to the Taoiseach on November 15th to say that the reply was the best he could do but that it did not answer the question? \n  \"I have to laugh,\" Ms Harney continued,  \"when I heard the new Fianna Fail leader talk about openness, transparency and accountability\"  .\n She said that of course the party would want a judge to look at their behaviour, because they would be in government before the outcome would be known, and if there was a general election, the matter would be sub judice.\n The Fianna Fail leader, Mr Bertie Ahern, interrupted:  \"That is incorrect.\"  Ms Harney:  \"If so, why do you want a judge?\"  Mr Ahern:  \"Because I 'd rather a judge than you.\"  \n Ms Harney asked if the acting Minister for Social Welfare, Dr Woods, had gone to the homes of Mr Fitzsimons. She pointed out that if the Government had told the truth in the Dail on November 14th-15th, and said that Mr Whelehan had been asked to  \"consider his position\"  , then Mr Whelehan 's swearing in as President of the High Court would have been postponed and would have lapsed after 10 days.\n She said Official A in the Attorney General 's Office was supposed to take the blame, that he did not understand paedophilia, that he was too busy with other things. \n She was delighted, even  \"at this 11th hour\" , that the house was beginning to get answers.  \"I don't believe we have got the whole truth.\"  She said, it was a poor reflection on parliamentary democracy that the truth was coming out because of a leak to a journalist. It was only then that Labour pulled back. But she added that information had come out only because the Labour Party took the position it did.\n The only place for Fianna Fail was in opposition, she said. There were alternatives, and a new administration had to be the first one. It had to be truly frank and open. She said the truth had not come out about the Masri passport affair. There had been the beef tribunal, and the tax amnesty. So a lack of openness and transparency was not just something that had happened in the past three weeks. \n Ms Harney pointed out that everybody had to play their part in the task of putting a truly open and viable government in place. That was important. If that could not be done then  \"we should not be afraid to consult the people\"  .\n She said there was a tendency in Fianna Fail that  \"you must cover things up and the worst thing of all is being caught\"  . She advised the 650,000 decent and honourable people who voted for Fianna Fail in the last election to be more discerning. \n\n\n<$D>\n   'Every judicial move I make is interpreted as being against somebody'  \n  Italy 's white-knight magistrate resigns  \n  ITALY  \n Paddy Agnew, Rome \n Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the magistrate who has become Italy 's best-known corruption investigator, resigned yesterday, prompting a probable political storm. \n Mr Di Pietro has been a key figure in the celebrated, nearly three-year Tangentopoli inquiry that brought down Italy 's corrupt Christian Democrat and Socialist old guard. \n In a letter to his superior, Milan 's chief prosecutor, Mr Francesco Severio Borelli, Mr Di Pietro said he hoped his resignation would  \"depersonalise\"  the Milan-based Tangentopoli enquiry, adding that he was tired of  \"being used\"  by many different shades of political opinion.\n The letter went on:  \"Every judicial move I have made has been interpreted as being against somebody or something ... For that reason, in a spirit of service and with death in my heart, I am leaving the judiciary.\"  \n Mr Di Pietro 's resignation is the most obvious manifestation yet of tensions between he Tangentopoli pool and the right-wing government of the prime Minister, Mr Silvio Berlusconi. \n Last July the government was forced to drop proposals banning the use of preventive detention, a key element in the investigative methods of Mr Di Pietro and his colleagues, when its proposed emergency legislation prompted widespread public protests. \n At the time, opposition forces suspected Mr Berlusconi of wishing to block the Tangentopoli investigation into his own <*> dollar sign </*> 7 billion Fininvest company. Indeed shortly after the failed government decree, Mr Berlusconi 's Fininvest employee, Mr Salvatore Sciascia, were arrested, charged with paying bribes to tax inspectors.\n Two weeks ago Mr Berlusconi himself was notified that he was under investigation on possible corruption and bribery charges. \n In the meantime, however, the government is fighting back at the magistrates, by sending in judicial inspectors to assess their work, and with a Supreme Court decision last week which moved the section of the Tangentopoli inquiry relative to Mr Berlusconi away from the Milan magistrates and awarded it to their colleagues in nearby Brescia.\n Mr Borelli said last night that the Milan pool would continue its investigative work, despite Judge Di Pietro 's resignation. But the fact that a man who had become a symbol of reform found himself forced to resign was a point underlined by the industrialist, Mr Carlo De Benedetti, one of many public figures to regret Mr Di Pietro 's resignation. He said:  \"If Di Pietro is to resign like this, then we 've lost one of the key figures in the Italian revolution...a man who was a symbol for all Italians. His resignation could have very negative consequences for Italy 's image.\" \n The opposition leader, Mr Massimo D'Alema, secretary of the Democratic Left (PDS), blamed the government.  \"This resignation is proof that apart from proving a failure in its social and economic policies, this government is involved in creating a climate of restoration of the old corrupt system,\" he said.\n Mr Di Pietro was hard at work in Milan yesterday, concluding the state 's case in the Enimont trial, Italy 's  \"mother of all corruption cases\"  . Twenty-four defendants, including the former Prime Minister and Socialist leader, Mr Bettino Craxi, and the present Northern League leader, Mr Umberto Bossi, are accused of having accepted illegal payments into party offers by the Montedison chemical group.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6e9fff61-6aaf-415e-a246-bc3f3532cf5e", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.657177+00:00"}

He is nobody 's eejit or fool There was absolutely no point put to him on  The Late Late  that hadn't been put to him a thousand times before. \n I have no regrets. I thought we did it very well. No matter how we did it, it was going to be wrong as far as some people are concerned. It 's up to others to decide who won and who lost. I don't go for this sort of thing. Did Gay Byrne or Gerry Adams win or lose? The proof of the pudding is in the eating. \n Right now, there is a feeling that he did very well. On the other hand, if Gay Byrne had thrown his arms around him there would have been an outcry from the other direction. If we had ignored the past and the 3,000 people    dead, Gay Byrne would have been criticised for having left all that out. I believe strongly that talking about the past is part of the peace process. \n People say I didn't shake hands with him. That 's wrong. I did. And the thing about me standing in front of the audience is wrong. Before the show went on air, I went down to the audience, as I often do, to see who wanted to talk. That 's why I was there when it began. \n The format of the programme was agreed beforehand. We had discussions with Rita O'Hare [Sinn Fein spokeswoman] and he knew who was going to be there. I don't believe he was isolated. The panel was pretty well as balanced as we could get. We had hoped to get Mary Harney on but she thought about it and decided not to but asked that Michael McDowell go on. \n The antipathy shown to him, especially by Hugh Leonard and Austin Currie, represents a point of view held by a huge number of people. I believe that Dermot Ahern and Jim Kemmy did alleviate that. \n If most people say the audience was with Gerry Adams, so be it. I know the audience pretty well on  The Late Late.  There were no invited people, they were the plain people of Ireland. Roughly half the audience applauded - and it was a weak sort of applause and both sides got it. \n He was very reluctant to talk about personal matters. After the show, he was chatting and joking and incidently told me a story about Joe Cahill. A couple of years ago, I did a New Year 's Eve show and said to the audience:  'Now I know you are all going to give up smoking and I know too that you 'll all be smoking again tomorrow'  \n Well apparently Joe Cahill, who was smoking 90 a day then and had a heart problem, was watching and because he hates me so much he said  'F <*> three asterisk signs </*> you you bastard'  and he gave up smoking there and then. Now his heart is stronger than ever! \n We do the hard job on  The Late Late  : talking about subjects about which people have strong feelings.

The last gigs I did, clients were complaining: I was having to sit down,\" said Thom McGinty, better known as the Diceman, whose flamboyant costumes and spectacular statuesque stillness have made him a famous part of the street furniture of Dublin, whether advertising a shop or a show, or glamorising the platform of a political parade. \n Street work is his living but he 's choosy about the causes he 'll promote:  \"I 'm pro-life - in the real sense\"  . \n Thom McGinty is gay and associated with the gay rights movement - for which he created the  What 's Another Queer?  performance after the murder of a gay man in a Dublin park - and has promoted safe sex in the Department of Health 's Aids awareness campaign. \n The Diceman is credited by groups like Galway-based Macnas as the inspiration for the new, highly visual style of Irish street parade and has been the glamorous centrepiece of arts festival parades all over the country. \n The indecency conviction in 1991 came after he advertised a production of  The Rocky Horror Picture Show  wearing a G-string and the fishnets.  \"The main conention was that I had nothing on underneath, but I did: I had a pair of very fine denier pink tights,\"  said McGinty.  \"I 've worn less: once I had nothing on but for a lot of silver and gold paint and a contraption on my cock. There was no trouble about that: it must be something about fishnets.\"  \n That episode cost him a few thousand pounds - no small consideration for the Diceman. He 's famous, but he isn't rich.  \"As a matter of fact, I 'm badly broke,\"  he said, wondering whether to have another coffee or get 10 cigarettes. The proceeds of tonight 's benefit will be used to set up a trust fund. \n McGinty has been in Ireland now for 18 years.  \"I was born near Glasgow, in a mining village, but I believe I was conceived in Baltinglass, in Co Wicklow ... in the fields. My mother was from there and we used to spend our summers there,\"  he said. \n Studying chartered accounting in Strathclyde University, he became involved in theatre and began to work as a model in art school.  \"That trained my stillness and my patience. We had to hold poses for six hours,\"  he said. \n He moved to Ireland in the mid 1970s for a modelling job that didn't transpire. Having sold his possessions, he started posing in a Chinese chrysanthemum jacket -  \"like something out of the Mikado\"  - in the Dandelion market, holding a piece of brown paper declaring that he was  \"in love with the country, unable to gain employment\"  . \n Phillip King of Scullion introduced him to Mark O'Brien who had a shop called The Diceman. McGinty was hired to promote it, wearing a royal blue musician 's costume and a turban, and his career took off. \n He has promoted wellingtons in Cyprus ( \"it was supposed to be the rainy season but it was blazing sunshine\"  ), played the Mona Lisa in the Louvre, headed the St Patrick 's day Parade in Moscow, and was the judge in the Parade of Innocence after the release of the Guildford Four. \n He has been, among other characters, God, the Devil, Dracula, an angel, a clown and Ronald Reagan - the latter two in separate performances, incidentally.  \"For company, I prefer the pimps, the prostitutes, the junkies and the thieves to the hypocrites,\"  he said. \n He 's always been open about being gay, saying:  \"I 'm into love and romance. You take guys out and wine and dine them, but it scares them off\"  . \n He is now seriously ill and has been for some time.  \"It was a big shock,\"  he said.  \"But my condition is stable.\"  \n He plans to paint masks and watercolours and has acquired a body-building exerciser but jokes:  \"The most I 've done with it so far is to carry it home\"  .\n Apart from a brief, impoverished spell in Spiddal, he has lived in Dublin.  \"It 's been good to me and I love it. Dublin has a centre and a heart. I would like to die on Grafton Street, along by Bewley 's. I 'd be dressed as Cleopatra and escorted by a host of Nubian slaves wearing next to nothing. \n  \"Songs are very important to me.

The questionnaire asked if each bishop and head of religious order had ever received a complaint about alleged child sexual abuse against a priest or religious    in their diocese/order. It also asked if the Gardai had been informed about any such cases; if the alleged abuser had been transferred to any other position or recommended for a professional position: and if his futures employers were told about the allegations. \n Five bishops and six heads of religious orders responded. Of the respondent bishops, Bishop John Kirby of Clonfert said that he had been informed of a case of child sexual abuse, from which criminal proceedings ensued, while a spokesman for Bishop Patrick Walsh of Down and Connor said that a case of a priest charged with indecent assault was currently before the courts. Only one provincial of the religious orders contacted said he knew of an alleged child abuse case involving one of his members. He revealed this only on conditon that neither his name nor that of his order would be published. A reply was received from Fr Kevin Smith, the Norbetrine abbot who resigned last week, saying that his attention had never been drawn to any case of paedophilia in his order, other than that of the jailed priest Fr Brendan Smyth. \n Two of the other bishop respondents said that their attention had never been drawn to any such allegations since assuming office. These were the former Bishop of Raphoe Seamus Hegarty, and Bishop John Magee of Limerick, who also said that he had heard of no such allegations in his previous diocese of Cloyne.\n\n\n<$D>\n  Terry Rogers buys taxi plates worth <*> pound sign </*> 1m  \n By Daire O'Brien \n WELL-KNOWN Dublin book-maker Terry Rogers has become a significant player in the Dublin taxi business with the purchase, over the last year, of almost <*> pound sign </*> 1m worth of taxi plates. \n He has purchased 12 plates and a fleet of London-style cabs. The idea is to rent out a complete \"package\" to drivers. More specifically, this involves Rogers, and his son Billy, providing drivers with a licensed vehicle regular maintenance, insurance, road tax and a radio. All the driver has to do is drive. Drive a lot in fact. A package like Rogers ', which typically involves two drivers sharing the car, costs in the region of <*> pound sign </*> 700 a week. Typically the person on the day shift will pay slightly less than the night driver. \n On paper this looks like a good deal for Rogers. For an outlay of <*> pound sign </*> 75,000, an owner can expect a return of <*> pound sign </*> 35,000 a year. In reality, however, when the annual cost of leasing, maintenance, radio hire, insurance and road tax is taken into consideration, trade sources say a healthy net return is <*> pound sign </*> 100- <*> pound sign </*> 150 per driver a week. \n Demand for Dublin taxi plates, boosted by the arrival of Rogers as a cash buyer, remains strong, despite a going rate of around <*> pound sign </*> 75,000. With just 1,976 official taxis in existence, plates are rare and the entry costs are high. As well as the cost of the plate, an aspiring taxi driver can expect to spend anything up to <*> pound sign </*> 15,000 on a car, <*> pound sign </*> 3,000 for insurance, <*> pound sign </*> 3,000 to the Carriage Office for the transfer of a plate, <*> pound sign </*> 2,500 a year on maintenance, a further <*> pound sign </*> 2,500 annually on radio hire and last but not least a couple of tankfuls of diesel weekly. \n The perennial danger for owners is that the Government will sanction a new issue of plates. In a market which is extremely sensitive to supply and demand this could cause a sharp fall in the worth of plates. \n The last time taxi plates were issued by the carriage office was in 1992 when 100 new plates were distributed after a lottery was held among the 1,400 qualifying applicants. Not surprisingly, those who had invested large sums in the business were not happy. However a compromise arrangement, where the sale of the new plates was prohibited for five years, was reached.\n The ever present hackney problem, where there are no expensive barriers to entry, is cited as another difficulty by the trade. Taxi drivers are hopeful that legislation will soon be passed which will check the growth of this threat. \n Traditionally, the reason for the spiralling cost of taxi plates has been attributed to the glut of healthy severance payments from the early 1980s. One industry figure points out that owning a taxi is about the only  \"job that 's guaranteed for life\"  in the age of the multi-skilled employee.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d710d743-a44e-4e8f-bd0a-69c1adcc4875", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.658265+00:00"}
{"text": "<Clare Champion>\n\n\n<1$A>\n  KILRUSH ROCKED BY LEADMORE CLOSURE  \n  WEST Clare, and Kilrush in particular, was dealt another body low this week with the closure of ice cream manufacturers, Leadmore Dairies, with the loss of forty jobs.  \n  Thirty employees at the Kilrush production plant and a further ten at their Cork distribution depot were made redundant last Friday and a meeting of Leadmore 's creditors has been fixed for Thursday next, December 22. \n This latest setback for Kilrush has prompted local public representatives to make an urgent appeal to Shannon Development and other state agencies to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that the industry is saved. \n Competition and weather related factors were blamed by a company spokesman for the problems which led to the closure of Leadmore Dairies which has been in operation since 1946. However, he stressed that the company would continue to trade for the moment with agents distributing their ice cream and frozen food products from existing stocks. \n The spokesman said the company had been forced to make their employees redundant after negotiations with a potential buyer fell through. But, he hastened to add, there were ongoing negotiations with two other prospective buyers and he was hopeful that a deal could be struck with one of them to keep the long established industry going in West Clare. \n Kilrush U.D.C. Chairman, Gerry O'Malley, summed up the feelings of townspeople when he described the closure of Leadmore Dairies as a  \"real tragedy\".  He said it was a terrible blow for the thirty employees and their families coming so close to Christmas. Mr. O'Malley also expressed his regret at the loss of the other jobs at the company 's Cork base. \n  \"The closure of leadmore Dairies marks the end of an era for Kilrush\",  said Mr. O'Malley.  \"The company provided good employment for many people since 1946\".  \n The Council Chairman said the latest round of job losses in Kilrush represented a cut of five per cent in the town 's industrial employment base. He said that if the proposed E.S.B. rationalisation programme was implemented, with the net effect of 200 job losses at Moneypoint, West Clare could be labelled an industrial blackspot. \n Mr. O'Malley said that every possible effort should be made to secure a new owner for the company. He believed that Leadmore Dairies had enormous potential if new products were developed and new markets opened up. \n The Council Chairman appealed to business people in the area to show their support for Leadmore by continuing to buy their products which were being distributed by agents from stock. \n A Shannon Development spokesman said they were doing everything possible to facilitate a takeover of Leadmore by a new owner. He expressed the hope that a deal could be sealed with one of two interested parties. The spokesman said the possibility of getting Leadmore involved in a joint venture with another company could also be considered and this would involve diversifying into a new range of products aimed at a different area of the ice cream market from that which they had traditionally serviced. \n Meanwhile Clare Co. Council suspended standing orders on Monday to discuss an emergency motion which sought the immediate intervention of the Government in averting the closure of the Kilrush plant. \n Describing the announcement of the job losses  \"as a black day for West Clare\",  Fianna Fail councillor Bill Chambers tabled the motion, unanimously adopted, which called on the Government, the I.D.A. and Shannon development to come up with a rescue package to save Leadmore Dairies. \n His views were endorsed by fellow party member, Patrick Keane, who said that the loss of thirty jobs in Kilrush was comparable to the loss of three hundred jobs in cities like Cork and Dublin.  \"It 's important that the Government and some other state agencies step in and save the jobs at the Kilrush plant\",  he remarked. \n Kilrush councillor, Tom Prendeville, said that his immediate reaction to the close of the factory was one of deep regret and disappointment. Leadmore Dairies prided itself in the abiding loyalty and great sense of cooperation that existed between workers and management in this family-owned entreprise right up to the closure announcement last Friday. \n Leadmore Dairies was one of the most successful ventures ever undertaken by the Glynn family in Kilrush. Close on sixty people were employed there during the high season and represented a huge injection of <*> pound sign </*> 1 million annually into the local economy through wages and services. \n However, he said the closure wasn't totally unexpected. In recent months various factors had militated against the continued commercial viability of he operation. Despite increased marketing emphasis, sales of ice cream products had remained static, a matter not helped by poor weather, the impact of cheap imported ice cream products, depressed profit margins and ever tightening credit controls. \n  \"The closure of Leadmore Dairies is another body blow to the economy of West Clare which is still reeling from the fallout effects of the closure of Woodfab, Ceremacis, Glynn 's Mills and the threat of job cutbacks through the E.S.B. rationalisation plan at Moneypoint\",  he commented. \n Cllr. Prendeville said that there still remained  \"a slight glimmer of hope\"  that the Leadmore Dairies factory could be sold as a going concern and in that event some of the jobs lost last Friday could be salvaged under a new consortium. \n Senator Madeleine Taylor-Quinn has described the loss of 40 jobs at Leadmore Dairies as a  \"tragedy\"  and a major economic setback to Kilrush. It was also a family disaster for the Glynn family who have been good employers in the town, she said. \n She said that every effort must now be made to find a purchaser or arrange a joing venture between different parties to take over the operation of Leadmore Dairies which had been very successful in the past. All agencies, private and semi-private, would also have to give every backing possible to rescue the plant and ensure that the jobs were put back in place. \n  \"The people and the areas cannot survive such a setback, in addition to the 200 jobs already under threat at Moneypoint Power Station\",  said Senator Taylor-Quinn. \n\n\n<1$B>\n  Flash Floods After Deluge  \n  A number of homes were flooded in Bridgetown and Ennistymon and traffic was disrupted on a number of roads around the county as a result of Tuesday morning 's deluge.  \n Fortunately the flash floods, which followed from the half inch of rain that fell in a matter of hours, had subsided by Tuesday evening and everything was back to normal. \n However, three families in Bridgetown and one in Ennistymon have been left to count the cost of the heavy rain as their properties were damaged by flooding. The houses on the outskirts of Sourth East Clare village were flooded to a depth of over a foot when water cascaded off the land and Killaloe Fire Brigade was called to deal with the emergency. \n In Ennistymon, Bill and May Chapman 's two hundred year old Connell 's Cottage home at Deerpark, was flooded to a depth of two feet when a    stream   to the rear of their home burst its banks. The local fire brigade had to pump out the house. \n While there was minor flooding on some roads and a number of motorists ran into difficulties when their cars stalled, Gardai reported no major problems. \n A considerable amount of farmland, particularly in the North Clare area was also hit by the flooding, creating problems with foddering livestock for some farmers. \n\n\n<$C>\n  <italics> Patients Test Positive in Hepatitis Screen  </italics> \n  FIVE of the patients who attended the Hepatitis B screening programme at Limerick Regional Hospital on Friday last have tested positive for infection, according to a statement issued by the Mid-Western Health Board on Wednesday.  \n Out of a total of 1,520 patients, mainly from the Clare/Limerick area, who were contacted by the Health Board, 407 attended the screening programme and the five patients who tested positive have been contacted to reattend for further tests. \n The screening programme was ordered after Dr. Umesh Gaud who worked in five Irish hospitals during the late 1980s was convicted in London last October for practising while knowingly concealing the fact that he suffered from Hepatitis B. He is now serving a jail sentence in Britain. \n Dr. Gaud had worked in the Accident and Emergency Department at the Regional Hospital, Limerick for six months in 1987. \n However, Regional Hospital General Manager, Ian Carter said this week that there was still no evidence that Dr. Gaud had caused any infection to any of the hospital 's patients during his stay in Limerick. \n Meanwhile, the screening programme continues at the Regional Hospital this week and the special Helpline 1800-512500 is available to the public between 9.30 a.m. and 5.00 p.m. \n Results of tests are made available within 48 hours. \n\n\n<$D>\n   Drink Law Hitting Rural Communities  \n  Rural communities are now prisoners in their homes and are afraid to venture out because of the draconian penalties attached to the Road Traffic Act, said the Vintners ' Federation of Ireland when discussing plans to hold an emergency meeting on Tuesday next to review the new drink-driving level which has caused a huge drop in trade in many pubs all over the country.  \n For the second week-end in a row, Clare publicans were hit by the new law and they spoke of bleak times ahead for the rural pub, particularly over the Christmas and New Year periods. \n The new drink-driving limit and penalties have sparked off the biggest ever crisis in the VFI, said    its   president Michael Moloney of Ruan, who forecast that many pubs will close and thousand of jobs will be lost over the tougher drink driving regulations. Publicans and members of the public were expressing fear, anger and frustration. \n The VFI, which represents 6,000 pub owners outside of Dublin, has not been sitting back and has highlighted the implications of the new restrictions over the past number of months, said Mr. Moloney. He added that their warnings, however, were not listened to. \n The VFI President described national advertising advising motorists to use Dart and bus services as offensive to people in rural areas who could not avail of such services. He had already made contact with the Bus Eireann operations manager in Dublin to provide extra and later bus services in country areas. He was told, however, that they did not intend providing such services. \n  \"This is disgraceful and the Government should put pressure on them to provide them\",  said Mr. Moloney. \n He also called on the legislators to reduce the fines for drink-driving offences and said that the new regulations would also be a big blow to tourism as when visitors arrived in country areas they would find no shops, no Garda station, no post office and no pub. \n VFI chief executive Tadgh O'Sullivan, also contacted the Ministers for the Environment and Justice this week, expressing their concern. He said there was no public transport in rural Ireland \u00d0 not even taxis or cabs. The national safety council 's adverts only served to further annoy the community. \n  \"The fact that a person who has consumed two pints is deemed as guilty, with mandatory penalties, as someone who has consumed 20 pints, is unacceptable\",  he said. \n He forecast that deaths on the roads will increase over Christmas and said that the new legislation would bring loss of life as well as loss of jobs as they would have people walking and cycling on dark country roads who would be the victims of those speeding, untouched by the law. \n He called for action to modify the penalties: give discretion to the courts in place of mandatory penalties: allow a more reasonable approach by gardai (stopping people on the way to work must cease) and provide much needed public transport in rural areas. \n\n\n<$E>\n  Schoolgirl dies in road tragedy  \n  THERE was widespread sympathy for the family of Lissycasey schoolgirl who was killed in a traffic accident on the main Ennis to Kilrush Road last week-end.  \n Eleven year old Joan Melican, Decomade, Lissycasey, died instantly following a collision with a passing car as she made her way to Lissycasey National School. The accident happened a short distance from her home just before 9.30 a.m. on Friday morning. \n Joan was the youngest member of a family of six and she is survived by her parents, Patrick and Peggy, her four sisters and one brother. \n There were huge attendances at both the removal of remains from Normoyles Funeral Home on Saturday evening to the local church and at the funeral on Sunday. Joan 's schoolmates at Lissycasey school and members of the local GAA club formed a guard of honour on both days.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6a3c39dc-a692-4ffc-b57a-0140345ba1fc", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.659321+00:00"}
{"text": "<Kilkenny People>\n\n\n<$A>\n   HOGAN IS HOPEFUL   \n by Sean Keane \n  KILKENNY will not lose out in a new coalition. The  'People  has learnt that Deputy Phil Hogan of Fine Gael will be among the Ministers of State to be appointed in a new administration.  \n There is no question of a derailment of the new three party coalition between Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left (D.L.) and a special D.L. delegate conference will go ahead this evening (Wednesday). \n  Loss  \n Deputy Hogan 's appointment will temper the loss to the county of the Minister of State portfolio held by Fianna F&/ail 's Liam Aylward T.D. for almost three years. \n Deputy Hogan will not be a member of the cabinet to be named by new Taoiseach, John Bruton. However, the 34 year old will be appointed to one of the key junior positions possibly in the economic sphere. \n This will reflect his recent high public profile as Fine Gael spokesman on Transport, Energy and Communication. \n He raised the deletion of key parts from a consultant 's report on the proposed mine in Galmoy in what became known as the Cowengate affair. \n There will be no such job for Carlow 's Fine Gael Deputy, John Browne or for Deputy Seamus Pattison of Labour who looks unlikely to be brought into Government. \n Despite suggestions to the contrary, Fine Gael are committed to entering Government and will have eight members in the new cabinet. \n  Agriculture  \n It is almost certain that Wexford T.D. Mr Ivan Yates will be the new Minister for Agriculture while Deputy Michael Lowry from Thurles, currently Fine Gael Chief whip will also receive a senior ministry possibly Tourism and Trade. \n The Minister for Justice will be a Fine Gael appointee while the key Environment portfolio will go to Labour. There will be one or two members of Democratic Left, leader Proinsias de Rossa T.D. and probably Pat Rabbitte. \n A key figure in the local Labour organisation feels there will be little change in the Labour appointees from the last cabinet but that there could be changes in their portfolios. \n  Michael D.  \n Michael D Higgins is the bookie 's warm favourite to be re-appointed as Minister for the Arts, Culture and Gaeltacht. \n There is considerable speculation that senior counsel, Mr Dermot Gleeson will be offered the position of Attorney General. \n A close confidant of Mr Bruton, it was at Mr Gleeson 's private residence that Mr Bruton first met with Labour leader, Mr Dick Spring for talks on a new government following the collapse of the Fianna F&/ail-Labour administration. \n However outgoing Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Mr Mervyn Taylor T.D. is also being mentioned for the position of Attorney General. He would be the first solicitor to hold the position. \n Already Fine Gael activists in Kilkenny are looking forward to Deputy Hogan 's promotion. \n He was elected to the Senate in 1987 having unsuccessfully contested the general election. He was elected to the D&/ail in 1989 and re-elected in 1992. \n He was co-opted on to Kilkenny Co Council in 1982 following the death of his father Tom. In 1985 he was elected Chairman of Kilkenny Co Council. \n He holds a B.A. H Dip from University College Cork. He received his secondary education at St Joseph 's Freshford and at St Kieran 's College, Kilkenny. \n On appointment, he will have to resign as a member of Kilkenny County Council and will also have to step down as a member of the South Eastern Health Board. \n It is expected that these vacancies will not be filled until February and already there are strong indications that \"new blood\" will be brought in to strengthen the party at local level. \n\n\n<1$B>\n  Tried to eat cannabis  \n  A MAN tried to eat a piece of cannabis resin when he was being interviewed in Kilkenny Garda Station.  \n  Shane Ryan,  Priory Lodge, John 's Quay, Kilkenny, pleaded guilty to possession of cannabis resin and to obstructing Sgt. Michael Quinlan, Garda Pat Starr and Garda Eamon Doyle. \n  Garda Pat Starr  gave evidence that he and Sgt. Quinlan went to the Kilford Arms at around 5 p.m. on November 12, on the basis of information they had received. \n Garda Starr told Ryan, who was with two others, that he wanted to bring him to the Garda Station to search him, as he had reason to believe that he had a controlled drug. \n When Ryan stood up, Garda Starr noticed a small slab of material underneath him. When he asked him to account for it, Ryan denied that it was his. \n In the interview room at the Garda Station, Garda Starr left the slab of material on the counter and went next door to get an evidence bag. He had just left when he heard a commotion in the interview room. He returned to find Sgt. Quinlan grappling with the defendant. \n  \"Shane Ryan was attempting to eat the material. I retrieved it and placed it in an evidence bag,\"  Garda Starr recalled. The material was found to contain .250 grams of cannabis resin. \n Defending solicitor  Mr Michael Lanigan  said that the 20-year-old, who came from a very good family, was currently attending a hotel and catering college in Portrush. His obstruction of the Gardai was impulsive, when he realised the situation he had got himself into. \n  \"He believed he was facing the demise of his reputation and character and he acted in a way that was stupid and he is sorry for it,\"  said Mr Lanigan.\n The solicitor added that Ryan 's family was positively ashamed of the disgrace he had brought on them and he would be willing to undergo any test to show the court that he was drugs-free and would remain drugs-free. \n  Judge William Harnett  adjourned the case until February 14 for a Probation Officer 's report, querying substance abuse. \n\n\n<1$C>\n   \"Stay away from airports!\"  says Judge  \n A YOUTH climbed into an ambulance outside St. Luke 's Hospital late at night and started blowing the horn, Kilkenny Court was told. \n His defending solicitor said that  Patrick Houlihan,  11 Ossory Park, Kilkenny, had always wanted to see the inside of an ambulance. \n  \"For God 's sake tell him to stay away from airports!\"  declared  Judge William Harnett.  \n  Inspector Michael Delaney  said that Gardai were called to the hospital at around 11.15 p.m. on June 24, because youths were causing trouble and interfering with ambulances. \n Houlihan was sitting in the front of an ambulance and was blowing the horn. He denied the incident when he was confronted by Gardai. He was summonsed for interfering with the mechanism of an ambulance. \n Defending solicitor  Mrs. Mary Molloy  said that the 18-year-old had been drinking with friends during a World Cup match. One of his friends dislocated his arm and they went to the casualty department in St. Luke 's. Houlihan could not resist the temptation of getting into an ambulance outside the casualty section. \n  \"He tells me that he long harboured the desire to see what the inside of an ambulance looked like,\"  Mrs. Molloy told the court. The solicitor added that this was the first time any member of her client 's family was in trouble. \n Inspector Delaney confirmed that Houlihan came from good family. It was just a case of youths messing and there was no intention to remove the vehicle. \n Noting that Houlihan should take his court appearance as a warning, Judge Harnett gave him the benefit of the Probation Act. \n\n\n<1$D>\n  Christmas winner for schoolgirl  \n By Carmel Hayes \n A CHRISTMAS card designed by a Kilkenny schoolgirl is now on sale throughout Dublin. \n The card, designed by Bevin Grant from Piltown, was professionally printed after she was runner-up in a national competition. \n And to mark her achievement, Bevin was presented with a prize by US Ambassador to Ireland Jean Kennedy Smith, at her residence in the Phoenix Park. \n The national school student from Tybroughney, Piltown, was one of ten runners-up from hundreds of entries, in the national  Irish Times /  US Embassy Design a Christmas Card competition. \n She was a special guest at a children 's Christmas party, complete with a buffet and present-laden Santa, which was hosted by the US Ambassador to announce the national winners. She was personally congratulated by Mrs. Kennedy Smith and was presented with a painting kit. \n  \"I was surprised to win and the day was very exciting,\"  said the delighted 11-year-old, who attends Piltown National School. \n Bevin 's cheerful design greatly impressed the judges and has now been printed for sale in aid of the children 's charities Barnardos and Focus on Children. \n The card features a jolly snowman, wearing a red hat, scarf and gloves, who is holding a sheet of Christmas carols. \n The cards are on sale from the Barnardos headquarters at Christchurch Square in Dublin and from the organisation 's shops in Clondalkin, Liffey street, Rathmines and Dun Laoghaire. \n Bevin is now looking forward to sending her cards to friends and relations this Christmas. A keen artist, she has been successful in a range of competitions, particularly at Iverk Show. She is one of five daughters of Una and Jim Grant of Piltown. \n\n\n<$E>\n  CALLAN \u00d0 The future looks bright  \n  CALLAN is getting its best ever Christmas present this year with confirmation that the new bridge for the long awaited by-pass will start construction early in the new year.  \n And people of Callan are in buoyant mood according to successful businessman and local public representative, Cllr. Jimmy Brett who said he was delighted with the news and feels that it will act as a catalyst for further development in the town. \n  \"My main political    since I was first appointed to Kilkenny County Council has been to secure the by-pass for Callan.\"  \n He said that it was great satisfaction that the long years of suffering endured by the people of Callan, truck drivers and motorists was at an end. \n He told the  'People  that the contract for the first stage of the multi million development had been awarded to John Craddock & Company, Naas. This has been approved by the National Roads Authority. \n He thanked the management of Kilkenny Co Council for their work on bringing the project to fruition, the Minister for the Environment, Mr Michael Smith T.D. and the National Roads Authority. \n  \"Most of all I want to thank the people of Callan for their patience and support,\"  Cllr Brett said. \nLocal industries continue to blossom with S.F.L. Engineering continues to forge new contracts in previously untapped markets. \n The Callan Bacon company is also trading extremely well while the small but hugely independent Callan Co-operative Society trading better than many of its bigger neighbours. \n Callan acts as a magnet to shoppers from Kells, Kilmoganny, Windgap and Mullinahone who are happy to give their business to tried and trusted traders who have been with them through good times and bad. \n Business woman Mrs Breda Somers of Adelphi House, Bridge Street has noticed an increase in heavy goods vehicles using Callan in the last few months. \n It is thought that the drivers of these articulated lorries coming from Waterford and Tipperary have a better run to and from Dublin since the Kilcullen by pass opened. \n Two new books on Callan have just been published. Volume one of Callan 's Pictorial Past is available at <*> pound sign </*> 5 per copy. \n This is a must for anybody interested in their own place or in local history. It was produced by John O'Keeffe and Sean Holden. \n The second is a detailed account of the goings on in the \"Callan Tenant Protection Society.\" This excellent work was launched by Bishop Laurence Forristal in the town on Friday evening. \n Callan has a fine academic record with both St Brigid 's College and the CBS Secondary School recording excellent results and adding to the reputation of the town. \n\n\n<$F>\n  SFL \u00d0 a sound structure  \n SINCE the Berlin Wall came down, and the frontiers of Eastern Europe were opened, SFL Engineering Ltd. at Callan has been successful in capturing some of the market opportunities that have become available as a result of the major rebuilding programme that is presently taking place in Germany and these Eastern countries. \n  Investment  \n From Statoil, who have also invested heavily in the Irish market, SFL was successful in obtaining the contract to build a large number of new petrol retain forecourt canopies for their service stations and this contract is expected to run for three years. \n SFL Engineering are steadily increasing their penetration of export markets and during 1994 carried out contracts in China, Israel, the Philippines, Denmark and Germany. \n SFL employ approximately 70 people at its plant in Callan. The company expects additional jobs to be created as it further penetrates the export markets.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "5332c5ce-647f-44d2-9a09-117b4019a505", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.660471+00:00"}
{"text": "<Roscommon Herald>\n\n\n<$A>\n  Environment Award For Council  \n Roscommon County Council this week picked up its second major award in two years from the Department of Environment 's Local Authority Environment Awards scheme. \n Two years ago, it won the overall award and this year was the winning authority in the County Council category. It received a cheque for <*> pound sign </*> 5,000 which will be used to upgrade and enhance the amenity area at Dalton Terrace, Ballaghaderreen. \n This year 's win, said the Minister for Environmental Protection John Browne, was evidence of the  \"consistently high quality\"  of the council 's work. \n In particular, he added, it had established a Farming Community Programme in association with the IFA which encouraged farmers to take care when disposing of waste plastic arising from round-baled silage. \n In addition, a free paint scheme was available for the Tidy Towns committees and a freephone service was provided during Clean-Up Roscommon Week. This was linked to a recycling programme which included a cardboard recycling scheme as well as glass and can recycling schemes. \n Overall, the judges considered that the submission was particularly comprehensive. They were also impressed by the Council 's decision to base their environmental programme on the results of a questionnaire completed by local community groups. \n The overall winner for 1994 was Drogheda Corporation which also won the 15,000 plus urban authorities category. \n\n\n<$B>\n  Garda Crackdown Gains Momentum  \n  As the Garda crackdown on drinking and driving moves into top gear throughout the county publicans have warned that thousands of jobs will be lost unless the Government quickly provides a late night public transport service and eases the penalties under the new legislation.  \n  By Christina McHugh  \n This week Crime Prevention Officer for the Roscommon/East Galway Garda Division, Sergeant Larry Shine, warned motorists who intend taking a drink over the Christmas period to  \"arrange to have a competent sober friend\"  available to drive them home, ensuring that they are properly    insured   to do so.  \"Eliminating excessive speed and drunk driving will make a major contribution towards safer roads,\"  said Sergeant Shine. \n Warning of Garda checkpoints on all roads in the county, he reminded motorists that following the new legislation, which came into effect on December 2nd, that a conviction for drunk driving can lead to the imposition of a penalty of <*> pound sign </*> 1,000 and or six months imprisonment with automatic disqualification from driving for a period of two years for a first offence.  \"You may have to undergo a driving test before you get your driving licence back or obtain a certificate of fitness,\"  he explained.  \"People who need a vehicle in their line of business, to get to work or tend to family needs should consider these factors,\"  Sgt. Shine stressed. \n However, as the new legislation begins to take its toll on rural publicans in particular, the President of the Vintners Federation of Ireland, Mr. Michael Moloney, stressed that already business is down by almost 50 <*> per cent sign </*> in some areas since the new drink driving limit was introduced. \n Warning of the loss of thousands of jobs, Mr. Moloney said that  \"this piece of legislation will be the cause of pub closures and job losses around the country because the penalties for enjoying oneself are now so severe that the Irish people are frightened to go out to their local pub or to a friend 's house.\"  \n He described the situation in rural villages as even  \"worse than the rest of the country\",  adding that people have now become prisoners in their own homes. \n Mr. Moloney suggested that the Government should ensure that people are treated more fairly and with more respect.  \"The government should reduce the penalties and introduce immediately alternative transport arrangements around the country,\"  he said. \n  \"Ordinary people all around the country are frustrated with this new legislation. Normally local politicians would listen to the people of Ireland and act as their voice at national level, but politicians today are too busy looking after their own affairs about being in or out of Government. They are not paying any attention to the things which are causing the destruction of a vital part of Irish culture,\"  claimed Mr. Moloney. \n Meanwhile with Christmas shopping in full swing and the January sales just around the corner Gardai ask shoppers to take precautions as regards their personal security and the security of their vehicles. \n Sgt. Shine advises the public to bring only the minimum amount of money to meet shopping needs and not to leave goods on view    in   unattended vehicles. \n  \"With hazardous driving conditions a likely feature on our roads in the coming weeks, we suggest that now is an appropriate time to check that your vehicle is in a roadworthy condition\"  said the Sergeant.  \"Excessive speed is a contributing factor in many road accidents. Motorists should allow sufficient time to complete their journeys and obey the speed limits.\"  \n For pedestrians the Gardai have this advice-  \"walk on the correct side of the roadway. When walking during the    hours   of darkness wear bright coloured outer clothing and wear an armband.\"  \n\n\n<$C>\n  Man Given Warning on Attitude to Gardai  \n  A Ballymote man who claimed he was  \"hassled\"  by a Garda had summonses against him dismissed when he apologised before Boyle District Court and when the court heard that he had a hearing problem.  \n Before Judge John Neilan for driving without insurance, giving a false name and not wearing a set belt at Greatmeadow, Boyle on August 3rd last was Brian Leonard, Carrowkeel, Ballymote. The owner of the vehicle, Gerry Clarke, Clerhone, Ballintogher, Co. Sligo, who was a passenger in the vehicle, was fined <*> pound sign </*> 200 and had his licence endorsed by Judge Neilan for allowing his car to be driven without insurance. The summons for driving without insurance was dismissed against Leonard. \n Garda Gerald Barry told the court that when he and Garda Peter Lennon stopped Clarke 's Opel Kadett car, he heard Leonard give an incorrect name to Garda Lennon. The defendant subsequently gave his correct name. \n  \"I recall saying to Mr. Leonard to give his correct name which he did,\"  explained the Garda, but replying to Mr. John Kelly, Solicitor for Leonard, he admitted that he couldn't say whether the other Garda asked the defendant for his name. \n Mr. Kelly 's contention was that in relation to Leonard giving a false name, that of Gerard Clarke, when questioned on that night, his client believed that Garda Lennon asked him who owned the car and not for his name. \n Leonard, in giving evidence, said that he had been at a dance in Roscommon. When the dance was over, Clarke requested that he drive his (Clarke 's) car home, in view that he (Clarke) had had a  \"few pints\"  too many. \n    Witness said that he first made sure that he was fully covered on Clarke 's insurance, which he believed he was. \n He went on to say that when the car was later stopped by Gardai, he remembered Garda Lennon asking him  \"who owns the car\"?  He replied  \"Gerry Clarke.\"  He informed Judge Neilan that subsequently, the Garda had used  \"abusive language\",  and told him to  \"get out of the car.\"   \"He accused me of being drunk,\"  explained the defendant. He added that he did not remember Garda Barry saying anything. \n Under cross-examination from Supt. P.J. Ward, Leonard denied that the accompanying Garda had asked him to give his correct name, and confirmed again that Garda Lennon was being abusive.  \"He told me to get out of the f <*> dash sign </*> ing car and accused me of being drunk\"  said Leonard. \n When Leonard told the court that he was still seated in the car when Garda Barry came over  \"five or six minutes\"  after the other Garda had asked him  \"to get out\",  Judge Neilan wondered how he could reconcile such a statement. \n The Judge also added that  \"the defendant had levelled very serious accusations against Garda Lennon. It 's a serious allegation to make.\"  \n Solicitor, Mr. Kelly said that there appeared to be  \"a lot of confusion\"  over the time-scale of events, and felt that  \"people have a different perspective of time.\"  \n  \"   There   appears to be some misunderstanding as to what was said that night,\"  he added. \n The Judge responded by saying  \"I 'm not prepared to stand idly by, and allow accusations to go unfounded.\"  \n Leonard, in trying to clarify the situation said:  \"He (Garda Lennon) told me to walk up and down the road, and accused me of being drunk. He was hassling me.\"  The defendant, who explained he didn't take a drink, went on to say  \"I thought I was doing Clarke a good turn.\"  \n  \"Why do you have a difficulty with the Gardai carrying out their duties,\"  he asked. \n Supt. Ward explained to the court that if the defendant was unhappy with the Garda 's behaviour the options were there for him to make a complaint. \n Leonard, a single, unemployed man, was warned of his attitude to Gardai by the judge, who declared that they are  \"citizens of the state and should be treated with a degree of dignity.\"  \n The charge of insurance was dismissed against him, but he was initially fined <*> pound sign </*> 25 for giving a false name, and further fined <*> pound sign </*> 15 for not wearing a seat-belt. However, the summonses were later dismissed when Leonard apologised to the court, and when it was later discovered that the defendant had a hearing problem. \n\n\n<$D>\n  Working Group Set Up To Examine Boyle College  \n  The proposed changes in the second level educational scene in the Boyle and Ballghaderreen catchments were once again the subject of queries from members of the Co. Roscommon Vocational Education Committee at its December meeting on Monday.  \n By Brian Cunniffe \n The meeting was told by the Committee Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Kevin McBrien, that the <*> pound sign </*> 1.7m Department of Education allocation for Boyle 's new school would be for new buildings only. He added that the Department of Education were currently making a survey of work needed on the existing buildings. He also informed the meeting that the V.E.C. had no plans to dispose of its property in Ballaghderreen. \n Providing the meeting with an update on the Boyle developments since the last meeting Mr. McBrien said that a meeting took place on December 6th in Boyle. The Managements of the three schools and representatives of all the staffs met then with the Independent Facilitator and there was a very frank and open discussion. A working group was set up consisting of parents, management and teachers to examine various modules of Community Colleges in existence  \"to see which of those would be availed of\"  \n Mr. Christy Brady said that there was delight around the Boyle area that a new school was coming. He then queried the nature of the <*> pound sign </*> 1.7m allocation as to whether or not some of it would be expended on refurbishing existing buildings. \n Mr McBrien-  I understand the <*> pound sign </*> 1.7m is in respect of new buildings. I admit it would take quite a considerable sum to refurbish some existing buildings.  \n Regarding Ballaghaderreen Mr. McBrien said that a meeting was arranged for January 12th next involving the Management of the three schools in Ballaghaderreen, the teacher representatives and union representatives to discuss the pros and cons associated with the staffing situation involving the amalgamated schools. \n\n\n<$E>\n  A Guide to Choosing Toys  \n Parents and relatives buying toys for Christmas have been asked to consider the \"play value\" of toys, as well as the safety factors when deciding on gifts. The appeal comes from the National Children 's Resource Centre who have just launched, with Dunnes Stores, a free guide for parents and guardians on selecting toys for children and young people. \n Entitled \"A Guide To Choosing Toys\", the booklet has been compiled to help parents and relatives make the right toy choices in order to encourage the development of children in their care. \n  \"Children learn through play,\"  says Angela Canavan from the National Children 's Resource Centre.  \"Play helps children to acquire new skills and abilities, fosters creativity and enhances overall development. Toys play an integral part in this process, whether to develop independence, encourage sharing, stimulate intellectual development or fostering creativity.\"  \n The Guide includes basic criteria for selecting toys and includes suggestions for each stage of development, from a baby, up through pre-school years and up to teenagers. \n The Dunnes Stores guide is available free of charge from the National Resource Centre (Tel: 01 - 4539699) and copies can be obtained by sending a stamped-addressed envelope (.30p) to the National Children 's Resource Centre, Barnardo 's, Christchurch Square, Dublin 8.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "fa644104-e5ac-4fc3-9907-1b329930437f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.661464+00:00"}
{"text": "<Munster Express>\n\n\n<$A>\n  MUCH RESENTMENT TO DRINK DRIVING LAWS  \n  The new drink driving laws have been received with anger and resentment by most members of the public and licensed vintners to such an extent that, if there was an election in the near future, the matter would almost certainly be a major issue.  \n Every person the \"Munster Express\" spoke to on the subject this week was at pains to suggest that they did not condone drunk driving in any way. But they felt the new laws were unsocial and draconian and an attack on ordinary law abiding citizens at a time when muggers, vandals and burglars were terrorising the community. \n It also emerged that there was no animosity towards rank and file members of the Garda Siochana who are seen as people merely doing their job. But there was much bitterness against the politicians who introduced the legislation and the fact that so many officers have been diverted to check-point duties. \n In a separate development, which could have a bearing on the controversy, the Garda Representative Association expressed  \"serious concern\"  this week at the decision of the Commissioner to introduce a new staff appraisal system for gardai. \n  \"What will happen is that individual gardai may well be tempted to opt for the soft target, like motorists, rather than concentrating on longer term crime detection\",  said the Association 's Waterford based deputy general secretary, Mr. P.J.Stone. \n The mood of the people was also evident on RTE 's \"Questions and Answers\" on Monday night when, in a show of hands, the vast majority of the audience showed their opposition to the new laws. A return to the status quo and a scale of fines and punishments, depending on the concentration of alcohol involved, were the options most favoured. \n A suggestion by Ms. Avril Doyle, T.D., of Fine Gael that Ireland adopt the French system of dealing with drunk drivers has also been finding much support in recent days. In France, the punishment matches the concentration and the consequences of a ban on the defendant 's spouse and children is also taken into consideration. \n  DROP IN BUSINESS  \n The new laws have very definitely taken their toll on the business of some pubs, especially in rural areas where there is no public transport or taxi service. A sales representative with a major drinks supplier told the \"Munster Express\" orders were down this week in some areas. He cited one small rural pub which had two customers on Saturday night compared to the usual forty. \n  PUBLICANS SPEAK THEIR MINDS  \n The following are the views of just some publicans we spoke to during the week. All stressed that they did not condone drunk driving and their customers were abiding by the new laws. \n  Michael O'Gorman, The Rhu Glenn  \n  \"All our customers are very upset. Usually one would find that a person taking two drinks would be the driver of a party of three or four but now that is all stopped. We have supplied a mini bus and are driving people home to Waterford, New Ross and areas in between. There seems to be a lot of resentment among the public at the new situation\".  \n  Robbie Walsh, Fox 's Den  \n  \"Many of our customers are men who would drink two or three pints and then drive home along the back roads. These people are steady as rocks and no danger to anybody but now they are so scared they don't even want to take one drink. They come in and have a mineral but are miserable with it.\"  \n  \"The social fabric of society is being destroyed and, when the summer comes, it will    seriously   affect tourism because the Irish pub will soon be a thing of the past\".  \n  \"People are angry and feel the efforts of the gardai are being deployed in the wrong direction. I hope the resentment does not materialise against individual gardai as that would be a shame. But there is a real danger that many decent people will begin to view the gardai as the enemy instead of a friend as it should be.\"  \n Mr Walsh has introduced a pub based hackney service and hopes that will assist his customers in their dilemma. \n  Jim Harney, Dunhill  \n  \"Most of my customers have described the situation as a downright disgrace. They are very moderate drinkers who enjoy a social night out which is now being made very difficult for them to continue with.\"  \n  \"There is almost the same punishment for a man with just half a pint over the limit as there is for a real drunk driver. People are even afraid to drink at home because they have to be on the road the next morning\".  \n  \"I am running this pub since 1947 and we never had an accident involving people leaving this premises. Last night, one of my customers went home three miles down a dark road on a bicycle. He was in more danger from a fast, sober driver than from a moderate drinker who drives carefully\".  \n  Seamus and Renee Comerford, Mooncoin.  \n  \"Last weekend was very busy but there were only three cars in the car park and two were owned by staff. We have been driving customers home ourselves while others are using a taxi. Many couples are taking it in turns to stay on the dry\".  \n  \"In general, the reaction of customers to the new laws has been very negative as most feel the situation is unfair. There is a drop off in custom from people who were in the habit of dropping in for a drink or two before going home from work in the evenings\".  \n  \"Decent people will always comply with the law but many people are telling us they feel hard done by by the new regulations\".  \n  Michael Baroon, Glenmore  \n  \"The situation should have been left as it was as there was no trouble being caused by decent, respectable people driving home after a social night out with just a couple of drinks taken.\"  \n  \"We have many people who drop in late at night and rarely have more than two drinks. This pub is a meeting place and they come for the chat more than anything else and now they are frightened even to do that.\"  \n  \"We have organised a taxi to be in the area and we will accommodate customers ourselves if possible but there is a great opposition among the people to the new laws\".  \n  Paul Cusack, Power 's Seaview Hotel.  \n  \"Because Tramore is an urban area we have a lot of customers who do not need to drive. But all of Tramore is going to suffer once the summer comes because the Sunday afternoon driver who likes to come out for a walk on the beach and have a drink or two before going home will be a thing of the past.\"  \n  \"Most of our customers think the new situation unfair, especially in the blanket way the ban is applied. They feel there should be a difference between the person socially sober but barely over. They are very different to a person with a lot of drink on board as nobody could condone such behaviour\".  \n\n\n<$B>\n  HISTORIC BUILDING VANDALISED  \n  The former Walsh Asylum, now renamed Walsh House, dates back to the 1860 's and only the quick thinking of a responsible citizen saved all its records and ledgers from almost certainly being destroyed.  \n Doors, windows and other fittings were smashed and, in the oratory, a Communion table was hacked to pieces and religious vestments trampled underfoot. To the great relief of the trustees who administer the business of the charity, a beautiful stained glass window in the oratory escaped the attention of the vandals. \n  PRESERVED  \n The building is preserved under the Corporation 's city plan but some time ago it became clear that the years had taken their toll and part of the complex, which comprises five terraced houses, was condemned. The trustees then embarked on a major scheme which would protect the building and provide eighteen modern apartments for elderly people. \n The architect for the project is Mr. Ronnie Falconer of C.J. Falconer and Associates and he told the \"Munster Express\" he was appalled at the damage cause by the intruders. He said it had taken some time for the trustees to bring the plan to fruition but the Department of the Environment had now approved grant aid and a contract had been agreed with a builder. \n The concerned citizen who discovered the damage told our reporter he was absolutely shocked at what he saw. \n  A Shambles  \n  \"I was passing the building and noticed that the side door was open so I went in to investigate\",  he said. Continuing, he declared:  \"What I saw was unbelievable as the whole inside of the building was a shambles. It was utter destruction\".  \n  \"The place was also full of cider bottles and human excrement and, when I went upstairs to the oratory, I found the communion table hacked to pieces and priests ' vestments trampled underfoot near more human excrement\".  \n  \"In another room I found books, papers and ledgers scattered around the floor and I discovered that they were the actual records of the institution. I collected them all and brought them down to Waterford Corporation where officials took them into safe keeping for the owners\",  said the man. \n The building has, once again, been secured and Gardai are investigating the matter. \n\n\n<$C>\n  ALARMING CHILD SEX ABUSE FIGURES  \n  The Community Child Centre at Waterford Regional Hospital dealt last year with 70 confirmed victims of child sex abuse and another 35 unconfirmed high risk cases.  \n The Centre, which serves the south east region with its 129,000 children, had 176 referrals  \"for further treatment and investigation\"  and in 40 p.c. of cases abuse was confirmed. \n The unconfirmed high risk cases (20 p.c.) were children who were thought likely to have been victims but where the child 's story was perhaps inconsistent or unclear in some respects. \n A further 20 p.c. were classified as  \"unconfirmed low risk\"  - they did not make a definite disclosure of abuse. \n The remaining 20 p.c. failed to complete their assessment at the Child Centre and they, according to Clinical Psychologist Dr. Mairi Keenleyside, who provided the statistics, may be particularly vulnerable. \n  \"It may be that the families who fail to complete assessment have more problems but end up receiving less services\",  stated Dr. Keenleyside, who is with Waterford Community Care. \n  \"Dysfunctional families may find the assessment procedures particularly stressful and may end up receiving less services because they have opted out of the prescribed assessment procedure\".  \n When a child is being assessed at the Child Centre the gardai are involved and that may lead to legal procedures against the abuser. Children may be required to give evidence in court against an alleged perpetrator and many studies have shown that waiting for and taking part in court procedures is very stressful. That could lead to an exacerbation of emotional and behavioural problems, Dr. Keenleyside points out. \n  KILKENNY CASE  \n She said that in the U.S., other legal system designed to reduce child distress and to get the alleged abuser to comply with treatment, had been examined. It was suggested as a consequence that at least for intrafamilial first time offenders, a system whereby the alleged abuser was offered treatment prior to legal intervention was the most promising way forward. \n She said that data published in the Kilkenny incest case report and taken from a study in the Eastern Health Board area in 1988 showed that of 990 cases of child sexual abuse reported to the board, 507 were referred by the gardai to the Director of Public Prosecutions. That resulted in 38 cases where the defendant was found guilty. \n In other words, there were convictions only in respect of 4 p.c. of the original allegations. \n  TRAINING NEEDS  \n In highlighting some of the problems with the present system for processing cases of child sex abuse, Dr. Keenleyside said the training needs of professionals in contact with children required to be carefully addressed. \n In particular, professionals needed to be more informed about abusers and to be aware of the protocol within their own agency for dealing with child sex abuse cases. They also needed further training in the practicabilities of dealing with children who made disclosures of abuse. \n  FEAR  \n She said also that more consideration should be given to children and families who made an initial disclosure but who then opted out of the prescribed system, perhaps through fear of legal implications for the alleged abuser. \n She concluded that while obviously further development of services for victims of abuse was essential, treatment services for abusers should also be highlighted. Given the low rate of abusers who received treatment or who were prosecuted, there was perhaps a need to review the legal procedure for dealing with those cases. \n (People concerned about abuse are advised by Dr. Keenleyside to contact their G.P., or their social services at Tel 015 - 76111).", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "2ef7d749-6252-44aa-8482-cb134d8cc162", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.662438+00:00"}
{"text": "<City Tribune Galway>\n\n\n<$A>\n  Theatre:  'We don't have the money'  reveal Corpo  \n  BY DECLAN TIERNEY  \n The delay in proceeding with the construction of a theatre for Galway city is down to the fact that Galway Corporation do not have the funding needed to allow the project go to tender. \n Earlier this week Minister for the Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Michael D. Higgins slammed the corporation for what he described as their lethargic attitude towards providing a theatre - for which <*> pound sign </*> 1.5 million has been sanctioned by his Department. \n But Acting City and County Manager, Joe Gavin said that for the project to go ahead, the local authority had to raise <*> pound sign </*> 750,000 - that being the difference of what the cost of a theatre would be and the grant allocation from the Government. \n  \"This is money we do not have and until we have these funds available to us, we cannot go ahead with the theatre\".  said Mr. Gavin, who added that the appointment of a fund-raiser would be made next month. \n Once Government sanction was received by the Corporation last year, it was decided to set up a trust with a view to raising the balance so that the project could go ahead. \n Mr. Gavin explained that the Corporation got an architect to give an estimated cost of providing a theatre and this worked out at <*> pound sign </*> 3 million - as this would be out of the reach of the local authority, they asked that the design be  \"pruned down\".  \n The architect then came up with a plan that would cost <*> pound sign </*> 2.25 million which eliminated a number of aspects to the original design like rehearsal space, a number of offices and also affected the type of finish to the building. \n  \"All this took time and now the Corporation, in co-operation with members of the trust, will be meeting to discuss ways of raising the money required to begin the project. Interviews will also be held for the purpose of appointing a fund-raiser,\"  Mr. Gavin added. \n Minister Higgins warned that if the grant allocation was not taken up this year, it would have to be justified all over again when the Government plans its budget for next year - with the possibility that it might not be approved. \n Mr. Gavin, however, stressed the Corporation 's goodwill towards the project and their anxiety to be in a position to give the go-ahead.  \"At the moment we are not in a position to build a theatre\",  he said. \n  \"Galway Corporation is very supportive of the arts and we are endeavouring to ensure that a theatre is provided in the city. We are now taking the next step as we would like to see the theatre put in place\",  Mr. Gavin added. \n\n\n<$B>\n  Ballybrit defies the odds with <*> pound sign </*> 1.5m. a day gambling spree  \n  BY Ciaran Tierney  \n  Any talk of recession has been banished from the Ballybrit area this week as huge crowds once again flocked to the annual Galway Races . . . with <*> pound sign </*> 1.5million a day being wagered on the course.  \n  With the usual gaggle of celebrities, politicians, serious punters, and tricksters, rubbing shoulders with ordinary racing enthusiasts, the annual festival retained its unique atmosphere, with the fine weather of the past two afternoons ensuring bumper crowds again at the race course.  \n Aggregate Tote figures have been down each day on last year 's record figures, but it 's been a very successful race meeting with huge sums of money changing hands on the course over the four days so far. \n Indeed, the Galway Races have proved once again that they are virtually recession-proof by managing to attract big crowds once again despite a summer which has seen a significant slump in the number of Irish tourists visiting the West on short breaks, due to the poor weather experienced since May. \n The crowds were down a little on previous years for Wednesday 's Galway Plate but, whether it was the Guinness Hurdle or Ladies Day that attracted them, punters certainly thronged the course yesterday. \n Tote figures for both of the main days, Wednesday and Thursday, have been down considerably on last year - but those in the know have discounted this as a significant trend as bookmakers on the site pulled in over <*> pound sign </*> 1 million in bets on both days. \n Wednesday 's Tote aggregate was <*> pound sign </*> 441,465, down almost <*> pound sign </*> 42,000 on 1992, while yesterday 's aggregate rose to <*> pound sign </*> 489,233, which was down <*> pound sign </*> 64,672 on last year. But with the bookies estimated to have handled approximately two and a half times the amount gambled with the Tote there was no shortage of money in circulation. \n Racecourse manager John Moloney said this morning that he was very happy with the week 's returns so far - and he underplayed the decreases in the Tote aggregates by pointing out that last year 's record figures were due to the fact that the Tote jackpots were carried over from day to day. \n  \"We have been very lucky with the weather and Wednesday and Thursday were two wonderful days here,\"  he said.  \"The crowds have held up this year, even though Monday was wet and Tuesday windy. And I would discount the decreases in the Tote, as there was a huge carry-over last year, while the bookmakers on the site have taken in over <*> pound sign </*> 1m both on Wednesday and yesterday (Thursday).\"  \n Some pundits joked that a full Cabinet meeting could have been held in the vicinity of Ballybrit earlier this week as there were so many Government Ministers in attendance, including An Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, the Minister for Finance, Bertie Ahern, and Galway 's Minister for justice, Maire Geoghegan Quinn. \n Other well-known personalities to grace Ballybrit with their presence this week included Paul Hill of the Guildford Four and his American wife, Courtney Kennedy; former Miss Ireland Michelle Rocca; and Alan Sugar, the man who owns top English soccer team Tottenham Hotspur, who made the headlines in the Spring when he sacked popular club manager Terry Venables.\n The pattern at Ballybrit, where the crowds are holding up even if there seems to be less cash flowing around, mirrors the pattern for tourism in the West of Ireland this summer. \n According to Regional Tourism Manager Brian Flynn the tourism market has held up pretty well even if there are decreases in some sectors, with the bad weather of the past few months in particular to blame for the slump in the number of Irish tourists visiting the region. \n  \"It is very hard to judge crowds of people and whether they vary or not from year to year,\"  he said yesterday.  \"But our business here is certainly as busy as last year. From the races we are getting a feedback that people are more cautious with their money this year and the spending sprees don't seem to be there, even if the numbers have held up this year.\"  \n He said that the numbers of European and British tourists, and returning emigrants, had held up pretty well or even increased this year, but there was a marked decline in the number of visitors from the home market - with the weather a factor in the reluctance of Irish people to take holidays at home this year. \n Mr. Flynn pointed out that there was a phenomenal growth in tourism between 1988 and last year, and Ireland West Tourism expected to record a modest growth this year. \n\n\n<$C>\n  Galway's Rowing Glory!  \n  TEAMS and players who enjoy major success on a regular basis would appear to have it all, but one thing they can never appreciate is the sheer euphoria attached to a club winning something which they have strived for decades to achieve.  \n  It was apparent when the Republic of Ireland qualified for the World Cup, when Galway hurlers won the All-Ireland in 1980 and when Galway United won the FAI Cup two years ago.  \n The ecstasy associated with such successes is one of the greatest joys in sport and so it was at the weekend when Galway Rowing Club captured the Irish Senior Championship for the first time since the club was formed in 1910. \n It was an achievement which the club have been striving for over eighty years to attain and one which, apart from a close effort in 1974, was always outside their scope. \n But this season was different. Five oarsmen - Luke Nolan, Tom Elwwod, Kevin Garvey, Sean Heaney and Malcolm Hosty - joined the club having tasted senior glory with UCG in 1991 with Nolan, Garvey and Hosty having also been on the victorious UCG '88 crew. \n The Elite crew was completed by Adrian McCallion, Conor Moloney, Vincent Breen and cox Martin Forde. They were the nine chosen during the season after the club had initially put two eights crews on the water. \n Training under the guidance of Mike Hackett and his assistant Myley McGrath began in October and from then to last weekend 's finals the crew trained over 300 times. \n Over 300 training sessions for a race that lasted little over five minutes clearly puts into perspective the amount of dedication required to succeed at the highest level in Irish rowing. \n The crew trained five nights a week in the gym for the first four months and took to the water twice on Saturdays and once on Sundays. \n The early season training centred around weights training in the gym and long-distance running ... usually about an hour a night ...as well as gruelling hill running. \n Towards the end of January the crew were able to take to the water for short periods in the evenings (with the help of a bicycle light on the front of the boat!) before the Head season began. \n By April it was time for speed work in the water with the crew usually putting in around eight training sessions a week. \n  \"We were improving all year. We were getting faster all the time. We rowed well in Henley without winning and we went into the finals knowing we had a great chance. \n  \"But while the training deserved success, you don't win unless you perform on the day. When we won it was a case of relief first before the elation took over. We have now broken the barrier,\"  said coach Mike Hackett. \n GRC went into the National Championships as favourites to win the Elite V111, a tag which was earned after several splendid regatta performances around the country all season. \n But it was also apparent from the outset that this was going to be one of the most open finals in years with Neptune, Belfast, Trinity and a composite from Cork/Clonmel/Shannon all in line for the title. \n The draw for the two semi-final heats threw up a dramatic selection with four of the top five crews being drawn in the same heat and only three could qualify for the final. \n And what a race the heat turned out to be. GRC, stroking 47 at the start, build up a lead of a canvas after 300 metres and after levelling out at a rate of 37 just one boat length separated the four leading boats at the halfway stage. \n But GRC always held the edge and were never really in danger of losing the race. In the end they had half a length lead from Neptune with just a canvas separating Belfast from composite Cork/Clonmel/Shannon boat. \n That heat win gave GRC the prime station in the middle of the course for the final with Tribesmen, Trinity, Neptune, Belfast and UCD spread either side of them. \n The moment of truth had arrived for Galway Rowing Club. A club which had waited over eighty years were now just over five minutes away from becoming the best in the country. \n It was a challenge that was met head-on and within 100 metres it was obvious that Galway were going to win the Irish Challenge Cup. \n Galway 's position in the middle of the course allowed them keep a close eye on all that was happening and with stroke Malcolm Hosty using all of his vast experience, GRC commanded the race from start to finish. \n A 20 stroke spurt at 500 metres gave them a three-quarters length lead over Belfast and at the halfway stage they still maintained that lead, although Neptune had pulled level with Belfast by that stage.\n GRC came in with a length and a half to spare over Neptune in a very fast time of 5:35, four seconds clear of their arch Dublin rivals with Belfast a canvas behind in third place. \n Their success has now seen them elevated to represent Ireland in the Home Countries championships in Strathcyde in Scotland when they will contest the final against England, Scotland and Wales. \n And also on the international front, Sean Heaney has been selected to attend a two week training camp in Sweden. Six oarsmen from around the country have been selected with four of them to be picked to contest the World Championships in September. \n The international selections are highly appropriate, coming at the end of the most glorious week in Galway Rowing Club 's illustrious history.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "8cc11cbd-3a2f-487b-a2fd-1098251134ef", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.663700+00:00"}
{"text": "<Leinster Leader>\n\n\n<$A>\n  Fears for jobs as Intel comes under pressure  \n By HENRY BAURESS \n INTEL Ireland has come under increasing pressure this week following the decision by IBM to stop shipments of personal computers which contain the Pentium chip. However its spokesman, Frank Turpin, said the difficulty won't affect the company 's plans in the short to medium term. \n The IBM decision follows the recent news that Intel and others have found a problem with the chip, but Intel said they have now dealt with it. \n Intel 's Leixlip plant is responsible for around half the company 's world production of this chip and half of the 1900 Leixlip employees are involved in its production. \n Intel said it discovered the problem with the chip in the summer. It has declined to recall the chips, but promised to aid those affected or replace chips where required. \n It claims the problem only occurs with very advanced mathematical calculations, rather than less complex uses. The Pentium was launched in May 1993. \n IBM said this week, however, that the likelihood of the problem occurring was much greater than indicated by Intel and a spokesman for IBM Ireland told the  Leader  on Tuesday that it was reacting to complaints from customers when it made its decision. It will resume shipments when it gets a better description of the problem, said Rory Caren, an IBM Ireland spokesman. \n IBM said Intel 's description of the flaw was technically accurate but there were many customer situations in which the risk of error may be significantly higher. \n IBM is just one of a number of PC producers which produces Pentium based PC 's. Compaq, Hewlett Packard, Dell, Gateway and Packard Bell have not yet followed IBM 's move. \n Intel have described IBM 's decision as  \"unwarranted.\"   \"Based upon the work of our scientists analysing real world applications and the experience of millions of users of Pentium processor based systems, we have no evidence of increased probability of encountering the flaw,\"  Andrew Grove, Intel President and CEO, said on Monday. \n He repeated Intel will replace any chips for any customer who might encounter the problem. Frank Turpin, Intel Ireland manager for external affairs, said on Tuesday that Intel hoped to take on another 300 people in the OEM systems plant over the next three months and the problem with the chip has been rectified. Dell has supported Intel 's stance, he said. \n This week, the company expects a decision from Kildare County Council on its planning application for an extension to the Leixlip plant. \n It is still hoped that an assembly and test centre will be built in Leixlip but plans for that third phase of the Leixlip development are on hold. \n The background to the Pentium debate is the fact that there is currently a major price cutting war in the very competitive arena of PC 's and their chips. \n At home, the news of the Pentium problem has led to unease.Many of the Intel employees come from various parts of Co. Kildare and the company has proved a huge boost to Leixlip. Mike Parle, Leixlip Chamber of Commerce PRO, said the chamber has prepared a  \"doomsday\"  plan should anything happen Intel, pointing to the exit of Digital. \n\n\n<$A>\n  Pioneers celebrate 70 years in Leixlip  \n By HENRY BAURESS \n Alcohol is a gift of God but its abuse is the problem. That was one the themes in a talk to Leixlip Pioneers by Fr. Bernard McGuckian, National President of Pioneer Total Abstinence Association. \n He was speaking at the mass to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the pioneer association in Leixlip in 1924. \n Referring to the Roaring Twenties in the United States, Fr. McGuckian said prohibition was a foolish attempt to deal with the problem of alcohol. The early pioneers were not puritanical, prohibitionistic or judgemental of others, but their actions were a response to the love of Christ and sacrifice.  \"They decided to light one little candle rather than curse the dark,\"  he added. \n Fr. McGuckian said that the Leixlip group may have been set up in the immediate aftermath of the Silver Jubilee celebrations of the founding of the national movement in 1898. It was held at the Royal Dublin Society in June 1924, some months before the start up in Leixlip on 28 November that year. \n The movement had started with Fr. Cullen and four women, said Fr. McGuckian.  \"The first four were women, as Fr. Cullen wanted only women in the movement initially, because he believed men had not suffered enough. But later a group of men pointed out they could be just as worthy of membership,\"  he said.  \n By 1918, there were 200,000 in the movement and when the Leixlip group was formed a further 50,000 joined. \n Drunkeness is a sin said Fr. McGuckian, but drink is not a demon, it is a gift of God. He said preaching, cajoling, police, prisons or psychiatrists could not prevent the abuse of it.  \"Only God 's grace can move a free human will.\"  \n Fr. Cullen, who founded the  Sacred Heart Messenger  used a term:  \"the gentle violence of total abstinence.\"  \n A Pioneer promises to pray every day of their lives for a person with a problem, and the movement is about love and concern for others. Wearing the association 's emblem, he said, is a public profession of faith that any human situation can be changed, not a boast about being a non drinker. Fr. Cullen wanted the Pioneers to preach the news that things can change. \n Fr. McGuckian told the congregation that he met a woman who lived in the Falls Road, amidst all the troubles 1980 's in Belfast. She said that since she had taken the pledge there was a peace inside her home which no trouble could take away. \n The worst thing about alcohol abuse is not the man it makes drunk but the children it makes afraid. They never get over it, he continued. A six year old girl in Newry told her teacher she wanted to join the Pioneers. When asked why, she replied it was because of what daddy did to mammy. \n The movement was a quintessential Dublin movement, said Fr. McGuckian and Dublin people should be proud of it. \n In Africa now, there are 250,000 Pioneers. They are joining in huge numbers there as they did in Ireland sixty years ago, mainly out of love for Christ. \n  \"We would like to have one Pioneer in every home at least. At least one praying that those who take    a drink moderately will remain moderate.\"  \n Fr. McGuckian said we must set out with great hope.  \"It is a movement primarily of love and compassion, not of indignation and irritation at human folly and stupidity.\"  \n Debauchery and drunkenness leads to a coarsening of the heart, he told the attendance, but he reminded them of Matt Talbot 's words that the Lord did not ask us to be successful but to be faithful. \n Matt Talbot, he said had to give up drink to stay alive but that act led to a lot more.  \"When I met the Pope a few years ago, he said to me:     Your   patron is Matt'  .\" \n\n\n<$B>\n Catalogue of crime in Athy \n by JOAN WALSH \n ATHY was the scene of a catalogue of crime over the weekend as vandals wrought havoc throughout the town. Gardai believe a local gang on the rampage is responsible for the spate of crime. \n On Friday night, the Community Services Centre, Stanhope Place was completely wrecked after vandals ransacked the building causing extensive damage. They hacked their way through doors and rifled every office in the building, even leaving excrement in places. Every light switch was smashed and phone lines ripped out of the wall. A small amount of cash was taken. \n The centre was closed all weekend and part of this week for repair works. Mr. David O'Flaherty, Director of Community Services said he was greatly encouraged by the number of people who offered their help. \n Meanwhile on Sunday night thieves broke into St. Michael 's Church but didn't manage to take anything. The same night, there was a break-in at Pearsons Garage, Woodstock Street but nothing was taken. Gardai believe all three incidents are linked and investigations are continuing. \n Meanwhile an Athy supermarket owner and his wife were the victims of a terrifying ordeal on Saturday night. The nightmare unfolded at around 10.40 p.m. as Desmond and Sadie Perry were at home watching television. There was a loud bang at the front door and the couple were confronted by three masked men, one armed with a sawn off shotgun and another with a knife. \n The raiders forced their way into the house and tied up the terrified couple. They took a substantial sum of money, mainly cheques and escaped in the Perry 's Ford Granada car. As the gang fled they pulled the telephone wires from the wall. Soon after, the couple managed to free themselves and raised the alarm. The car was recovered by local Gardai shortly after the incident at Tyrellstown. \n Meanwhile, also on Saturday there was an attempted raid at Valu Centre, Athy. The raiders fled as the alarm went off. \n\n\n<$C>\n  New office cost almost a million  \n by LIAM KENNY \n THE accumulated cost of the finished Naas Credit Union premises at No. 20 North Main Street has approached the one million pound mark. In a detailed breakdown to members at the AGM on Saturday night last the Credit Union directors calculated a total cost of <*> pound sign </*> 945,000 for the premises. \n More than <*> pound sign </*> 200,000 was swallowed up by work on two ill-fated designs which envisaged the total demolition of the old Marum 's premises and rebuilding of new structures. The first envisaged total demolition and the building of an architecturally imaginative new office building. This was dropped when it was realised that it was not acceptable to the Naas planning authorities. The second involved demolition and rebuilding to a more traditional design. \n Eventually this too had to be abandoned over engineering issues involving other properties but not before the Credit Union had spent <*> pound sign </*> 113,478 on architect 's and engineer 's fees and another <*> pound sign </*> 30,000 on a contract settlement to the builder in addition to other costs. \n A third course of rebuilding  within  the framework of the existing Marum 's premises had to be adopted in early 1993 which resulted in the present offices in August and cost <*> pound sign </*> 503,973 plus <*> pound sign </*> 75,182 for fixtures and fittings. \n The cost of the Marum 's site purchased in October 1988 was <*> pound sign </*> 188,427 of which <*> pound sign </*> 26,550 was recovered through the sale of the publican 's licence leaving an actual site cost of <*> pound sign </*> 161,877. A further <*> pound sign </*> 77,000 will be clawed back by the Credit Union through the sale of its old offices at No.32 North Main Street, leaving the net cost of the Credit Union 's property transactions over the past six years in the region of <*> pound sign </*> 870,000. \n Fortunately the Naas Credit Union 's financial performance is so strong - a reflection in turn of the popularity of its services - that it has been able to absorb such exceptional costs while at the same time granting dividends of up to five percent to members and transferring significant amounts to its reserve accounts. \n\n\n<$D>\n  Denied damage to Allen tower  \n by PAUL O'MEARA \n CLAIMS that the stone tower at the top of the Hill of Allen may be under threat because of the excavations which take place beneath the structure have been denied by Roadstone. \n Some local people fear that further action is necessary to preserve the building but according to Roadstone no quarrying has been taking place near the tower and a spokesperson dismissed a claim that fresh cracks have appeared. \n Roadstone has been extracting rock from the Hill of Allen for a good many years but the company says it is committed to preserving the tower. \n  \"It is our policy not to go near the tower. The company has done a good deal of restoration work there and this includes work to repair damage caused as a result of vandalism,\"  the spokesman said. \n\n\n<$E>\n  Newbridge scheme looks good  \nBy EAMON DILLON\n MAJOR developers are closely examining the Action Plan for Newbridge 's designated area. Urban Renewal Liaison Officer and Town Clerk Charlie Talbot said that he has had a large number of enquiries. Two of those include proposals for major property developments. In relation to one of them, a request for planning permission has already been lodged.\n  \"There 's no doubt about it, there 's money looking to be spent in Newbridge,\" he said. He explained that people making contact include those with property already in the area and those seeking to acquire property. He hoped it would be possible to  \"marry\" the two.\n Mr. Talbot added that there is a large demand for both public and private housing in the Newbridge area while it is the biggest shopping town in the county.  \"I can't think of a town that has more going for it,\" he concluded.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "45aab5df-f0d4-4848-add2-eb770c1e0c9e", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.664644+00:00"}
{"text": "<Tipperary Star>\n\n\n<$A>\n  Major Jobs Boost for Thurles  \n  THE town of Thurles received a major jobs boost yesterday, Tuesday, with the announcement that the Government has approved the making of a research and development grant of <*> pound sign </*> 575,000 to Erin Foods Manufacturing Ltd.  \n By Anne O'Grady \n The announcement was made by the Minister for Environment and Education, Mr Michael Smith, T.D., who stated that full implementation of the global investment package will result in the creation of 134 new jobs over the period 1993-1997. Over thirty-one of these jobs are already in place. \n Minister Smith expressed his delight that the Government were supporting this  \"thriving indigenous industry\"  in Thurles and he congratulated the management and workforce who had contributed enormously to this significant development. \n The news has also been welcomed by the former Minister for Agriculture, Senator Michael O'Kennedy who said he was happy that Thurles was enhancing its standing as the centre of the added value area in the food processing sector. \n The grant, which is being made available through Shannon Development, will go towards meeting the cost of an eligible research and development programme. Minister Smith stated that an integral part of Erin Foods; development strategy was the implementation of a major research and development programme and a detailed product development programme had been prepared and was being implemented in two phases. \n Mr Smith said that, in addition, a number of facilities in the form of capital aid for which Government approval was not required were being made available by Shannon Development to Erin Foods. These included a new industry grant of <*> pound sign </*> 132,000 towards the cost of eligible building works, a new industry grant of <*> pound sign </*> 414,960 towards the cost of eligible plant and machinery and an equity subscription of <*> pound sign </*> 500,000 (ordinary shares) in Greencore Plc. \n He added that the project had the backing of the National Food Centre and he confirmed that Greencore Plc were a party to the agreement. \n Mr Smith said the company 's drive in recent years for higher quality, added value products and the major successes which it had received on the export market had been instrumental in achieving this progress. \n  \"It is worthwhile to note that as recently as four years ago the company was only exporting seven or eight percent of its produce and now, in an increasingly competitive market, their export achievement has reached 33 <*> per cent sign </*> of produce. In the teeth of international competition they have gained a significant foothold with prestigious UK companies. Needless to say, the boost in jobs is a very welcome development for Thurles. The knock-on effect of this level of investment for the town is going to be substantial and the people of Thurles can look forward to a period of further growth and prosperity in the years ahead\",  he added. \n Meanwhile, Sentator O'Kennedy described the development as very major and said it was part of the culmination of the research and development which they had been promoting. The new development, he said, would deal with nutritionally balanced meals and recipe formations and would take Erin Foods into an entire new market niche. It was the latest in high technology and represented a very substantial investment of over <*> pound sign </*> 1 million at this point.\n  \"It is all very positive in that it represents a diversification into the value added area in the food processing sector which I was always very anxious to see promoted there and I very much welcome the culmination of this effort. It was always said under the Sugar Company that they would commit themselves to ongoing development there and I am glad to see it being brought to fruition\",  he said. \n Saying it was a very exciting development, he complimented the management and staff and said the whole approach to the development was very positive. He was very happy that Thurles was    reinforcing   its reputation as the centre of the added value area in the food processing sector. \n Councillor Frances Boyle, a Chamber of Commerce representative on Thurles Urban Council last night welcomed the news and congratulated all concerned. She added that Thurles could do with more such good news. \n\n\n<$B>\n  Gardai alert after Cashel raid  \n By John Guiton \n A TRAVELLING gang operating in the Munster region is thought to be responsible for a number of break-ins to filling stations, their latest target being the Esso station at Cahir Road, Cashel, in the early hours of Monday morning last. The thieves got away with    approximately   <*> pound sign </*> 1,000 in cash. \n Gardai are carrying out extensive investigations into the incident that occurred at the Esso station and shop, which is located on the outskirts of the town. The gang used cutting equipment to gain access to the premises through the roof and then made their getaway with the substantial amount of money. \n The robbery was carried out with clinical precision and Gardai believe that a number of people were involved in the incident. It is the latest in a series of break-ins to filling stations in the Tipperary-Cork area and Gardai believe that it could well be the work of the same gang who raided stations in Fermoy and Tipperary recently. \n A Garda spokesman said that every effort is being made to try and apprehend those responsible for the robberies, but he urged owners of filling stations and business premises to be extra vigilant, especially in the run-up to Christmas. The Cashel premises was unoccupied at the time of the break-in. \n The Garda spokesman said that it is obvious that the gang use heavy equipment to break into premises and he called on the public to report any kind of suspicious sightings without delay. \n Gardai in Cashel investigating Monday morning 's incident are anxious to hear from anybody who passed by the filling station in the early hours of the morning and may have seen anybody behaving in a suspicious manner. \n The Gardai are also interested to hear from anybody who may have seen a   ,  vehicle   or vehicles, parked in a suspicious manner in the town or on    its   outskirts. \n All information will be treated in the strictest confidence. \n\n\n<$C>\n  Wife in fear of husband  \n A MAN who visited his wife 's premises and allegedly put her  \"in fear\"  was handed out two prison sentences of six months each, but Judge Mary Martin, at Templemore court, when she convicted him of contravening two protection orders. \n Massimo Conte, 89, Pinewood Gardens, Moyross, Limerick, pleaded not guilty to a charge that on December 2nd at Patrick Street, Templemore, he did contravene a protection order made at Portlaoise District Court on that day in that he did put Marina Conte in fear at her premises. He was sentenced to six months imprisonment. \n He also pleaded not guilty to a charge that on October 28th., 1994, he contravened a protection order made at Roscrea District Court on 27th October 1994, in that he did put Marina Conte in fear at her premises in Patrick Street. He was also sentenced to six months imprisonment on that charge. \n Garda John O'Connor Templemore, said that on December 2nd at 8.05 p.m. he received a call to go to Marina 's cafe in Templemore. He was asked to go into the sitting-room of the house by Marina Conte. She informed witness that her husband Massimo Conte was on the premises and that she wanted him removed. She stated that she had a protection order against him. Witness informed defendant that he was not supposed to be on the premises. Defendant tried to put up a case and he (witness) arrested him and conveyed him to the Garda station. Later he left the station on the grounds that he would not go near the cafe. \n In reply to Mr. James Meagher Solr. For defendant, witness said that Marina Conte told him that she was  \"in fear\"  of her husband. He had informed defendant of that. Defendant felt that he was entitled to be at her premises if he was not harming her. Defendant 's wife had telephoned him before that and told him she did not want him there. Defendant must have got into the premises by a side door. \n Mr. Meagher -  There was no act of violence committed.  \n Witness -  No, but she was in fear.  \n Garda Costello, Templemore said that she accompanied Garda O'Connor to the premises. Marina Conte made a statement. She (Marina Conte) was in fear. \n    Sergeant   Martin, Templemore told the Court of investigating a complaint made on September 28th. He spoke to Marina Conte and she was in a frightened and upset state. He took a statement from her. She said that her husband (defendant) had pushed her on the premises and told her that he could treat her like a dog. He also arrested defendant in relation to October 28 incident when defendant again visited his wife 's premises. \n Garda Dwyer, Templemore also told the court that she took a statement from Marina Conte. \n Massimo Conte said that not everything said was true.  \"I never touched my wife and she can say that,\"  he said. He said that he had never been brought into Court before for  \"beating nobody\".  He never he said assaulted his wife. \n Supt. Mulryan for the prosecution,  are you saying that the evidence given here today by Gardai is cock and bull.  \n Defendant:  Near enough.  \n Judge Martin issued a stern warning to defendant that he was never again to go near his wife or his wife 's premises.  \"You are getting terms of imprisonment now but you will go to jail again if you go near her in the future\".  she said.\n Recognisances were fixed in the event of an appeal.\n\n\n<$D>\n  Survey points way to rural survival  \n  THERE could not have been a better location in which to launch a Muintir na Tire report on rural Tipperary communities than the breathtakingly beautiful but stark landscape of the Glen of Aherlow.  \n By Mary Hassett \n Guests at last Monday 's launch looked out from the plush surrounds of the Aherlow House Hotel to the magnificent hills and reflected on the people who are struggling to make a life for themselves in similarly rugged and isolated surroundings throughout North and South Tipperary. \n Some people may have imagined that Muintir na Tire was dead in all but name but the organisation founded in 1937 is determined to prove that it is as relevant today as on the date of its foundation. The organisation founded by Tipperary priest Canon John Hayes has always sought to respond to the needs of communities and parishes and to be forthright and innovative in its approach. \n  FOUR PARISHES  \n Perceiving the growing need to develop new strategies for creating employment which would both support and complement local development objectives Muintir na Tire commissioned a preliminary study of four communities/parishes throughout North and South Tipperary. The parishes involved were Templederry and Moyne-Templetuohy an North Tipperary and Fethard and Cappawhite in South Tipperary. The study was carried out on behalf of Muintir na Tire by Murphy, Ryan <*> ampersand <*> Associates Ltd., Management and Human Resources Consultants in Limerick. The study was funded in part by Tipperary Leader Group Ltd. \n The focus of the study was to examine the potential of each community to create an enterprise environment which would contribute to employment opportunities at local level. \n The outcome of the study quite clearly indicated that while potential exists to a degree within each community ongoing and focussed community development will be required in order to achieve the enterprise ambition. It is proposed that the optimum enterprise environment will include a working partnership arrangement between the community, local authority and all statutory / voluntary agencies relevant to each community. \n Careful community planning will be required in order to ensure that wherever possible all sectors of the community will be represented or given the opportunity to participate in all decision making and development. \n  DECLINING POPULATION  \n The study showed that Cappawhite, Templederry and Moyne-Templetuohy all have a declining population. The most alarming decline has taken place in Templederry which now has a population of 1116 which is 25 <*> per cent sign </*> of what it was in 1901. The population has decreased by 6 <*> per cent sign </*> between 1986 and 1991. \n The population in Moyne-Templetuohy has declined by 7 <*> per cent sign </*> between 1986 and 1991 while the decrease has been more than 10 <*> per cent sign </*> in Cappawhite over a similar period. In contrast the population in Fethard increased by 11 <*> per cent sign </*> between 1981 and 1986 with a further slight increase between 1986 and 1994. \n The study shows that 50 <*> per cent sign </*> of the population in all four parishes is dependant i.e. is under eighteen or over sixty-five. Unemployment appears to be low as people in all four parishes have left the area rather than remain unemployed. A significant percentage of the workforce are employed outside the parishes on either a long or short term basis. \n The report concluded that community activity and involvement exists within each of the four parishes. However this is at different levels of development. Potential exists for further development including the introduction of enterprise for the purpose of offering job opportunities to young people as an alternative to leaving the parish to achieve employment. The development of the tourism industry is possible in each of the four parishes. This will require care, planning, coordination, direction and participation. \n  COMMUNITY PLAN  \n It is proposed that a Community Plan be developed within each area which would address the issue of integration and enterprise. It is felt that a representative umbrella organisation should be introduced or strengthened in each area. \n Speaking at the launch the President of Muintir na Tire, Jim Quigley called on the incoming Government to give Muintir na Tire the necessary financial resources to employ Development officers on a national basis.  'Rural society must be preserved, stabilised and developed so as to avoid a social and economic imbalance between rural and urban',  stated the Toomevara born President who has been living in Dublin for more than 30 years.  'The study we are launching today is, in our opinion, a way of preserving one area of rural society within EU and national policies',  he stated. \n Ms. Wendy Ryan, Murphy, Ryan <*> ampersand </*> Associates Ltd., highlighted the energy, dedication and enthusiasm of local people in all four communities. She formally presented a copy of the report to Jim Quigley. \n Former MEP and champion of rural Ireland over a lifetime Mr T. J. Maher officially launched the report. He highlighted the fact that Canon Hayes had promoted a philosophy of self help which will have to remain to the forefront if rural Ireland is to survive and prosper.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "afc8f430-5f7d-4032-a663-8cbcfd302d94", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.665749+00:00"}

Over the period 1984-1990, a major investment in student workstations sponsored jointly by Northern Ireland 's Department of Education and Industrial Development Board, enabled the University to establish its delivery infrastructure for computers in teaching. As a direct result of this initiative, interest in computer based learning (CBL) became widespread across the disciplines of the University. In October 1987, to act as a focus for this interest, the University established the Centre for Computer Based Learning (CCBL) in a joint venture between the Computer Centre and the School of Education. The CCBL was successful in a number of bids under national initiatives (see under Major Projects), and this success along with a desire to enable the study of the foundational academic disciplines of CBL led the University to create an independent Institute of Computer Based Learning (ICBL) in December 1992. \n Aims and Objectives \n The aims and objectives of the ICBL are to create and maintain a centre of excellence for computer based learning at the University; to develop courseware and software systems to support the teaching of all academic disciplines; to carry out research into computer based learning techniques; to undertake commissions for courseware. \n Software development \n Software developments are undertaken not only to support the production of teaching and learning materials but also as an important foundation for research. The objectives are to develop authoring systems, related utilities and a number of generic applications for the three common delivery platforms, viz PCs, Macs and Unix workstations. Key disciplines include visual programming, object-orientation and functional programming, and important applications include hypertext and Q <*> ampersand </*> A management, data visualisation, animation, simulation, modelling and natural language response analysis. \n The underlying systems are written in C++ with an in-house class library offering common GUI objects and functionality across the three platforms. Writing in this system enables source code portability for tools, utilities, applications and courseware. The writing of courseware is facilitated by providing an integrated set of authoring tools and application generators, which make use of visual programming interfaces. \n Courseware development \n CBL may be used in many if not all areas of education and training. Within Queen 's, the ICBL works with a diversity of academic disciplines. Recent or current commitments at Queen 's range from advice on CVL and multimedia, through support of courseware development and use of tools, to actual collaborative projects. These activities have involved Mechanical Engineering, Built Environment, Pharmacy, Anatomy, Mental Health, Pathology, Dentistry, Accountancy, Italian, Legal Studies and the Staff Training and Development Unit. \n The most significant collaboration in this area is the University 's current TLTP project - producing 210 hours of CBL, across 10 disciplines involving 30 academics - which is described in more detail below. \n Research \n The foundational academic disciplines of CBL are education, psychology and computer science. The Institute provides a focus for inter-disciplinary research for academics from these disciplines. The main themes under investigation at present are: Pedagogical Design, Curriculum Content, Assessment, Evaluation, Human Computer Interface, Intelligent Tutoring Systems, Learner Models, Neural Networks, Visual Programming, Modelling and Response Analysis. \n Current research commitments are listed below Evaluation studies on the general use of computers in education and the particular use of CBL in the teaching of psychology. Lattice modelling of processes in polymer chemistry using statistical methods. Abstractions of graphical and textual language representations to support the construction of computer based models and simulators. Investigation and development of language systems for functional and object-oriented programming. Object-orientation methodology and reverse engineering for real-time network management. \n Teaching \n The ICBL will offer a MSc in Computer Based Learning, starting in late September 1994. Six modules are available in 1994/95: Information Technology and Services CBL Approaches CBL Systems Courseware Engineering Cognitive Modelling and Human-Computer Interaction Advanced CBL Design \n A further four modules will be offered in 1995/96. \n Staff Development \n The Institute promotes the awareness of CBL concepts and techniques through seminars, summer schools and workshops. In addition, the ICBL collaborates with the University 's Staff Training and Development Unit in seminars for staff induction and in workshops in teaching methods with the Enterprise Unit. \n Major Projects \n Information Technology Training Initiative (ITTI) \n This three year project is scheduled for completion in the third quarter of 1994. The products are courseware and other teaching materials on CBL itself, and authoring (system) tools. This is targetted at all tertiary level academic staff, and trainers in other organisations. \n Teaching and Learning Technology Programme (TLTP) \n This is a three year project to be completed in February 1996. The products are over 200 hours of teaching materials on a wide range of academic topics, to be deliverable on the three most common delivery platforms, viz PCs, Macs and Unix workstations. In the selection of topics and methods to be addressed, care has been taken to identify items of common interest to the wider audience of universities and higher education. At Queen 's, the new materials will generate over 50,000 student courseware hours per annum and a vigorous programme of dissemination will be undertaken to ensure that other institutions are aware of the materials to be made available. The academic disciplines are Education, General Practice, Languages, Obstetrics, Orthopaedics, Pharmacy, Physics, Psychology, Social Sciences and OR. \n Staff \n The director of the ICBL is Dr Fred McBride. Paddy Brannigan (Services) and Randall Thompson (Development) manage teams of courseware analysts and developers and systems programmers. The current staff complement is 23. \n\n\n<$B>\n The Queen 's University of Belfast \n Library Information \n Borrowing Books \n Who may borrow? \n All Queen 's University staff and registered students, associate members and reciprocal associate borrowers are entitled to use the library and to borrow from it. \n What may be borrowed? \n Most of the books in the library can be borrowed. Certain categories of material are not available for loan. These include all periodicals; bibliographies (class Z on the ground floor and floor 1 of the Old Library Building); past examination papers; new books on display; university calendars, telephone directories, timetables; reference books on the ground floor and floor 1 of the Old Library Building (and in the ordinary book stacks, if so marked); and most of the Special Collections. \n Period of loan \n   Undergraduates, Postgraduates on taught courses, Associate Members and Reciprocal Associate Borrowers  \n Undergraduates may borrow books from the main collection for two weeks; associate members and reciprocal associate borrowers for four weeks, this period being renewable if no prior reservation has been made by another reader. \n  Staff and Research Students  \n Staff and research students may borrow books from the main collection for twelve weeks, this period being renewable if no prior reservation has been mad by another reader. \n  (The loan period to all borrowers for material borrowed from the medical Library is four weeks)  \n Note:  Books for which there is a waiting list at the time of borrowing are lent for one week only to all categories of reader. If these are returned late they are subject to a fine of 50p per day overdue.  \n ALL BOOKS ARE SUBJECT TO RECALL AT ANY TIME IF REQUESTED BY ANOTHER READER \n Fines \n A fine of 5p per day, or 25p per week is levied for each book overdue (undergraduates, postgraduates on taught courses, associate members and reciprocal associate borrowers) Staff and research students incur fines at the same rate if an overdue notice has been sent and the borrower has failed to return the book by the date stipulated in the notice. Fines of 10p per day operate in the case of books recalled on behalf of another reader which have not been returned by the date stipulated on the recall notice. \n  Books borrowed from the Undergraduate Collection or the Restricted Loans Collections are subject to a fine of 20p per hour or part thereof, if they are not returned on time.  \n How to borrow books \n You should bring any books you wish to borrow to the Issue Desk on the Ground Floor of the Old Library Building and hand them, along with your barcoded staff, student associate membership or reciprocal associate borrower identity card, to the assistant who will validate the loan. \n How many books may I borrow? \n Undergraduate and postgraduate students on taught courses may have on loan up to ten books at any one time from the main collections of the University Library. Some material is kept at the Issue Desk (e.g. Offprints of recommended journal articles or chapters from books). Borrowers may have 3 items from this collection on loan at any one time. In addition, QUB students may borrow up to four books from the Undergraduate Collection. \n Personal Associate Members and Reciprocal Associate Borrowers may have 6 books on loan at any one time. Professional and Corporate Associate Members may have up to 10 books on loan a any one time. \n Staff and research students of Queen 's may have up to 25 books on loan from the University Library at any one time. \n  IMPORTANT NOTE: \n Borrowers remain responsible for books represented in the files by uncancelled records, and may be charged the replacement cost of any outstanding items. It is, therefore, very important that you do not leave books at the returns desk without ensuring that library staff have discharged the books in the computer files.  \n Lost books \n The loss of any books should be reported to the Issue Desk immediately. A replacement fee, which includes a handling charge will be levied. \n Renewing Books \n Books due for return may be renewed if not wanted by another reader. Books for renewal should be taken to the Returns Desk in the Main Library. \n  On an experimental basis a telephone renewal service is available for staff, research students, associate members and reciprocal associate borrowers. The number to ring for telephone renewal of Main Library books is ext 5022 (or 335022 from outside the University).  \n Reservation of books \n Should a book in the Main Library stock be on loan to another reader, it may be reserved by using the Public Reservation facility in the OPAC. Readers are limited to three 'public reservations' but additional reservations may be placed by enquiring at the Issue Desk. Alternatively, you may reserve a book by quoting the barcode number or ISBN to an assistant at the Issue Desk asking them to reserve the book for you. Readers may be asked to complete a reservation postcard. \n\n\n<$C>\n WORK FOR OUTSIDE ORGANISATIONS \n The Senate, at its meeting on 6 April 1993, approved new arrangements to govern all work undertaken by members of staff for outside bodies. These new arrangements are set out in detail in the attached Notes of Guidance. \n The main principles upon which new procedures have been based are: (i) a distinction between  Intra-Contractual Work  (i.e., work expressed or implied in contracts of employment) and  Extra-Contractual Work  (i.e. work which a member of staff cannot reasonably be expected to undertake as part of his or her contract of employment with the university); <ii> a requirement that all academic and academic-related staff make an annual return on all work undertaken; (iii) a requirement that, where possible, work for outside bodies be carried out within the University 's contractual framework; (iv) a requirement that members of staff obtain the permission of the Director of their School/Unit and of the Standing Committee before undertaking work outside the University framework; (v) an understanding that staff carrying out approved private work, up to an annual value not exceeding 10 <*> per cent sign </*> of their basic salary, should not normally be asked to make a contribution to University funds; and (vi) a requirement that staff carrying out work with a value higher than in (v) above, should normally make a contribution to University funds, or take an appropriate abatement in salary, or take leave of absence without pay. \n The Notes of Guidance also cover such matters are requirements for professional indemnity insurance, membership of public bodies, the treatment of honoraria paid for membership of outside bodies, detailed financial arrangements for outside work and on the exploitation of copyright material, patents etc, and conflicts of interest. \n You will see that paragraphs 4-6 of the Notes outline the requirement that members of staff make an annual return on all work for outside bodies which relates to their professional skill or position in the University,  plus  personal and voluntary work which, in aggregate, is of such a volume of so timed that it might impinge on the performance of inter-contractual work. \n A form has been prepared to facilitate the reporting of such work and a copy is enclosed. It would be appreciated if the form were completed and returned to  Mrs N Benton, Administrative Secretary 's Office by Friday, 17 June 1994.  \n This letter should also act as a reminder to those members of staff who wish to engage, or who have engaged in, work for outside organisations as covered by the procedures, but who have not as yet requested University permission. \n Please note that  NIL RETURNS ARE REQUIRED.  Members of staff for whom the form has no relevance at the present time are asked to complete Section 1 of the form, which should then be signed and returned. \n When received, a copy of the form will be made available to the Director of your School/Unit and to the Standing Committee in summary form.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "26f5031f-50b5-4c4f-94c9-b00336efa1ac", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.666829+00:00"}
{"text": "<Regulations>\n\n\n<$A>\n Are you paying more tax then necessary? \n More than 28 million people in the United Kingdom are paying more tax than they need to. \n Last year alone, we handed over in excess of <*> pound sign </*> 5 billion to the Inland Revenue which could have been avoided if our affairs had been arranged more tax efficiently. \n Without this contribution, the Chancellor would have had to raise the basic rate to 26.5p to collect the same amount. \n This startling information was recently revealed in research commissioned by IFA Promotion Ltd. Using the latest available Inland Revenue data, the report isolated almost <*> pound sign </*> 1 billion of tax paid in error; <*> pound sign </*> 1.3 billion which could have been easily avoided; and, over <*> pound sign </*> 3 billion which could have been saved by implementing rather more complex tax-saving strategies. \n The largest are of tax \"waste\" (over <*> pound sign </*> 5 billion) can be traced back to people not claiming their allowances. Income which should fall within their tax-free allowance ends up being taxed. \n Waste occurs when married couples, with one partner earning more than the other, do not use their allowances to best effect. If one spouse pays tax and the other doesn't, a switch of income into the non-taxpayers name would mean that the income would go from being taxed to tax-free. \n With the married couples allowance now fully transferable, higher earning wives can achieve a greater slice of tax-free income, while the widening of the 20 per cent tax band also offers scope for tax saving. \n Bank and building society accounts also provide fertile ground for tax waste. Deposits with banks and buildings society are taxed, at source, at the 25 per cent rate. \n Those people paying tax at the 20 per cent rate can claim a refund of 5 per cent while non-taxpayers can ask for the interest to be paid gross. But an estimated <*> pound sign </*> 360 million tax was paid last year by people who have either failed to register for gross interest or failed to reclaim the tax overpaid. \n A further <*> pound sign </*> 550 million could have been savvied if a greater number of banks and building society investors had made use of the Tax Exempt Special Savings Account (TESSA). The TESSA allows savings (up to <*> pound sign </*> 3,000 in the first year and up to <*> pound sign </*> 9,000 over five years) to grow tax free as long as they are held for the full five year period. \n Shareholders, both those holding equities direct or via a unit trust or investment trust, are wasting an estimated <*> pound sign </*> 750 million in tax. \n A small part of this total results from non-taxpayers failing to reclaim the tax paid on their dividends, but the largest proportion stems from insufficient use being made of the Personal Equity Plan (PEP). \n The PEP allows up to <*> pound sign </*> 9,000 worth of equities to be held in a tax-free environment each year. The savings in one year, while perhaps only marginal for the basic rate taxpayer, can mount up considerably over a period of time. \n The potential savings are obviously enhanced for the higher rate taxpayer. And yet, of up to 13 million share or unit trust holders, some 9.9 million have no PEP at all. \n Please remember that the levels and bases of taxation can change. The reliefs referred to are those that currently apply and the value of relief from taxation is dependent on individual circumstances. In addition, you must bear in mind that the value of shares and units can fall as well as rise and the return may be less than the amount investment. \n Inheritance tax is a particularly nasty tax in that it is levied on assets which have been accumulated with income that has already been taxed. \n The one thing in its favour, however, is that by utilising wills, life policies, gifts and the annual exemptions available, its impact can be largely mitigated. \n Few people though, plan ahead for inheritance tax and, as a result the Inland Revenue takes in around <*> pound sign </*> 1.3 billion every year from this source. \n Another area of waste can be attributed simply to mistakes made by the Inland Revenue. \n There are by no means infallible, but too many people accept what the Revenue say    they   owe without checking the figures. Random checking by the Inland Revenue in 1992/93, in an effort to find tax fiddlers, revealed some <*> pound sign </*> 270 million of tax overpaid, but this is obviously just the tip of the iceberg. A further <*> pound sign </*> 170 million could be saved if people declared all their income and paid their tax bills on time thereby avoiding penalties, which can be severe. \n Areas of potential tax savings abound. There are still many people for whom it would be tax efficient to contract out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (SERPS) while over <*> pound sign </*> 100 million could be saved by using the products of the Department for National Savings more effectively. \n The tax treatment of life assurance products, particularly friendly society policies, could again save more than <*> pound sign </*> 100 million per year. \n Nobody likes paying tax, so it makes sense to cut out as much of the waste as possible. Impartial, independent financial advice from someone well versed in the tax planning field is essential if you are to make the most of the opportunities available. \n This article has been authorised by a person who is regulated in the conduct of investment business by the Securities and Investments board.(SIB). \n\n\n<$B>\n Health and Safety Law (in Northern Ireland) \n What you should know \n Your health, safety and welfare at work are protected by law. Your employer has a duty to protect you and to keep you informed about health and safety. You have a responsibility to look after yourself and others. If there is a problem, discuss it with your employer or your safety representative, if there is one. \n This leaflet is a brief guide to health and safety law. It does not describe the law in detail, but it does list the key points. \n Your employer has a duty under the law to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, your health, safety and welfare at work. \n In general, your employer 's duties include: - making your workplace safe and without risks to health; - keeping dust, fume and noise under control;\n- ensuring plant and machinery are safe and that safe systems of work are set and followed; - ensuring articles and substances are moved, stored and used safely; - providing adequate welfare facilities; - giving you the information, instruction, training and supervision necessary for your health and safety. \n Your employer must also: - draw up a health and safety policy statement if there are 5 or more employees, including the health and safety organisation and arrangements in force, and bring it to your attention; - provide free, any protective clothing or equipment specifically required by health and safety law; - report certain injuries, diseases and dangerous occurrences to the enforcing authority; - provide adequate first-aid facilities; - consult a safety representative, if one is appointed by a recognised trade union, about matters affecting your health and safety; - set up a safety committee if asked in writing by 2 or more safety representatives. \n Employers also have duties to take precautions against fire, provide adequate means of escape and means for fighting fire. \n In many workplaces employers may have other specific duties: - to take adequate precautions against explosions of flammable dust or gas and when welding and soldering containers which have held an explosive or flammable substance; - to maintain a workroom temperature of at least 16 <*> degrees sign </*> C after the first hour of work where employees do most of their work sitting down; - to keep the workplace clean; - to provide, maintain and keep clean washing and toilet facilities and accommodation for clothing and to supply drinking water; - to see that workrooms are not overcrowded and that they are well ventilated and lit; - to ensure that floors, steps, stairs, ladders, passages and gangways are well constructed and maintained and not obstructed; - to take special precautions before allowing employees to enter and work in a confined space; - to ensure that employees do not have to lift, carry or move any load so heavy that it is likely to injure them; - to guard securely all dangerous parts of machines; - to see that employees, especially young people, are properly trained or under adequate supervision before using dangerous machines; - to ensure that lifting equipment (hoists, lifts, chains, ropes, cranes and lifting tackle) and steam boilers, steam receivers and air receivers are well constructed, well maintained and examined at specified intervals; - to give employees suitable eye protection or protective equipment for certain jobs; - to take proper precautions to prevent employees being exposed to substances which may damage their health; - to take precautions against danger from electrical equipment and radiation. \n As an employee, you have legal duties too. They include: - taking reasonable care for your own health and safety and that of others who may be affected by what you do or do not do; - cooperating with your employer on health and safety; - not interfering with or misusing anything provided for your health, safety and welfare. \n If you think there is a health and safety problem in your workplace you should first discuss it with your employer, supervisor or manager. You may also wish to discuss it with your safety representative, if there is one. \n If the problem remains or you need more help, health and safety inspectors can give advice on how to comply with the law. They also have powers to enforce it. Your employer can give you their names and addresses. \n The Department of Economic Development 's Employment Medical Advisory Service can give advice on health at work and first-aid. The address is: Royston House, 34 Upper Queen Street, Belfast BT1 6FX. \n You can get advice on general fire precautions etc from the Fire Brigade or your fire officer. \n The main legislative provisions are contained in the Health and Safety at Work (Northern Ireland) Order 1978, but for particular purposes the Factories Act (Northern Ireland) 1965, the Office and Shop Premises Act (Northern Ireland) 1966, the Agriculture (Safety Health and Welfare Provisions) Act (Northern Ireland) Order 1983, the Fire Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1984, the Mines Act (Northern Ireland) 1969, the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 and other Acts and Orders and Regulations made under any of these may be equally relevant. \n\n\n<$C>\n PROVISIONS OF COVER \n FIRST TRUST BANK ACCIDENTAL DEATH PLAN \n The following information has been prepared to summarise the benefits and limitations of this cover.

{"text": "<Health care>\n\n\n<$A>\n better service better care \n What the changes in health and social services mean for you \n About this booklet \n Every person in Northern Ireland comes into contact with the Health and Personal Social Services at some time, be it simply a visit to their GP or dentist, or perhaps a spell in hospital for something more serious. For those who, for whatever reason are unable to live independently \u00d0 for example disabled or elderly people \u00d0 contact with the caring services will be much more frequent, perhaps with visits at home by social work or community nursing staff. \n So the changes taking place in the Health and Personal Social Services are of interest to everyone. Some people however are worried about what services will be available in the future. Some of the questions being asked are: - will I still be able to get my prescription, even if the medicines are expensive? - if my family doctor has a practice fund, will I still get the treatment I need? - can I still have a choice of hospital if I need treatment? - will I still have a choice about where I have my baby? - will hospitals which become self-governing Trusts stay completely within the health service? - will health services still be free? \n The answer to all these questions is  \"Yes\".  \n This booklet has been designed to provide answers to questions like these and to give other information as well. However, it does not list all the services that are available. Information about services that are not covered here can be obtained from the bodies listed at the end of the booklet. \n The Government 's proposals \n The reforms described in subsequent pages result mainly from the Government 's White Papers \"Promoting Better Health\", which was published in 1987, and \"Working for Patients\", published in 1989. These proposals were aimed at making the Health Service more responsive to the needs of people and more concerned about improving their health, rather than just treating their illnesses. \n Community care services \n Since the publication of these White Papers the Department of Health and Social Services has issued \"People First\", in March 1990, which contained proposals for the future development of community care. These are in line with the Government 's approach to community care services, which is that they should be flexible and sensitive to individual need, that they should offer choice, intervene no more than necessary and should concentrate on those with the greatest needs. \n This booklet does not over the changes in community care \u00d0 many of which will not be in place before 1993. However further information will be made available in the future. \n The welfare of children \n An important part of the community care reforms will be new laws dealing with the welfare of children, which will be published for consultation later this year. The new legislation will reform the present law dealing with the care, protection and upbringing of children and the provision of services for them and their families and draw them together into single and more accessible code. \n Your family doctor \n Your family doctor \u00d0 or GP \u00d0 will be able to offer you and your family a wider range of services in future. There will be more emphasis on promoting good health and preventing disease. \n SERVICES FOR THE FAMILY \n Good health care is not just about treating you when you are ill, but also about giving help and advice so that you stay fit and well. \n The Department 's Chief Medical Officer says:\n  \"More and more nowadays, people are realising the benefits of a healthy lifestyle. There are no spin-offs: healthy people make fewer calls on the resources that we put into treating the sick and injured; and they enjoy life more. So the emphasis in the future must be more on prevention, less on cure.\"   \n What services should you now look out for? \n  For all adults  \n You will be able to get regular \"life-style\" check-ups. These will be offered to you when you first register with a doctor, or if you have not seen your doctor for some time. The purpose of these check-ups is to: - give you the chance to discuss anything worrying you; - provide an opportunity to carry out a few simple tests (such as checking your blood pressure); - offer professional advice if need on such matters as diet, exercise, smoking and drinking. \n In other words, your GP can advise you on how to look after yourself. This may include recommending that you attend one of the practice 's health promotion clinics. \n GPs will be encouraged to provide more health promotion clinics. These may include clinics giving detailed advice on diet, blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, heart disease, drinking and stress. \n  Family planning services  \n Family planning services are available from most GPs and from family planning clinics, which also make services available to men. You can choose where to go for family planning advice. \n If you prefer to get advice from a GP about contraception, you may choose to see a GP other than your own family doctor. Information about whether particular GPs provide contraceptive services is now more readily available (see \"More Information for Patients\" on page 9). \n Details of family planning clinics in your area are available from your local Health and Social Services Board (see the list of addresses at the end of this booklet). In addition to general sessions, you may find that some clinics offer sessions to deal with particular methods of contraception or for particular groups. \n Family planning services are provided free of charge to encourage all those who wish to use the services to do so. \n  For women  \n  Cervical screening (smear tests) \n About 40 women die from cervical cancer every year in Northern Ireland. Many of these deaths could be avoided if more women had regular smear tests (known as cervical screening or cervical cytology). \n Improvements are being made to the cervical screening services. How will these affect you? - all women between the ages of 20 and 64 are to be invited for screening (by March 1993). - the new system will ensure that all women in this age group are offered a test at least once every five years. \n Your doctor will be able to give you advice and encourage you to have a smear test if appropriate. \n The aim of the test is to detect conditions that could develop into cancer. If these conditions are found in good time, treatment is usually straightforward and almost always effective. \n  Breast cancer screening \n Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer among women. An entirely new province-wide breast cancer screening programme run from specialised centres is being introduced. How will this affect you? - all women between the age of 50 and 64 are to be invited for screening by breast X-ray by March 1994. You will then be invited for screening every three years; - screening for older women (over 64) will be provided on request every three years. \n This service is being targeted at women over the age of 50 because there is as yet little evidence that routine screening is of benefit to younger women. \n Your Health and Social Services Board (see the list of addresses at the end of this booklet) will be able to give you advice on local services, or our doctor can advise you. \n Women registered with a GP will get invitations for cervical and breast screening if appropriate. So please make sure that your GP has your correct address, especially if you have moved house recently. \n  Well-women clinics  \n GPs will be encouraged to provide more well-women clinics which deal with many issues to do with women 's health. \n  For children  \n  Child health  \n Your GP may offer a programme for following the development of your young children (under five years old). That means checks, in your GP 's surgery, on the height, weight, growth, development of the senses and other essential features in the first five years of your child 's life. Where your GP does not do this work, it will still be provided at local community clinics. \n  Childhood immunisation  \n If you don't get your children immunised against childhood diseases such as measles and whooping cough you are putting them at risk. These illnesses can be very distressing and sometimes dangerous. Your doctor will encourage you to make sure that your children get the protection of safe immunisation. \n The table below shows when you should get your child immunised (but if your child is older and has not been fully immunised it is not too late to see your doctor). \n\n  If you are over 75  \n Each year your doctor will offer you an assessment of your health and circumstances to make sure that all is well. \n You can have this check-up done in your own home or at the doctor 's practice or surgery. In any event, your doctor will offer to visit you at home, or arrange for one of the professional practice staff to visit you, to make sure you are well and able to cope. \n These services are strongly recommended. They offer the chance to get advice on how to deal with the problems everyone faces in old age. Failing eyesight, hearing difficulties, trouble with your feet and similar problems can often be helped once they have been identified. \n A BETTER FAMILY DOCTOR SERVICE \n  Greater convenience for patients  \n Changes are taking place in the way your doctor 's surgery is run. Over the next few years you may find: - more convenient surgery hours; - more comfortable waiting rooms; - minor surgery available on your doctor 's own premises, to save having to go to hospital. \n Will your doctor be able to spend as much time with you? - Yes. There are now more family doctors than ever before. As practice teams develop, you may be able to see not only the doctor, but the nurse, chiropodist and physiotherapist. \n  More information for patients  \n More information is now available to help you know more about the services your doctor provides. \n - Health and Social Services Boards now produce directories of local family doctors, giving information about each doctor and the service the practice provides. You can find the address of your Health and Social Services Board on page 20 of this booklet. \n - Each GP practice is now producing leaflets telling you about the range of health services available from the practice. \n - Moving to another doctor if you want to is now easier. All you have to do is go to the surgery of the doctor of your choice and ask to be registered. If your new doctor agrees to put you on his or her list, that 's it. Different doctors may offer different types of services and their leaflets will help you choose. \n  General Practice funding scheme  \n Family doctors already play a vital role in the health and social services and they will play an even greater role in future. From April 1993, bigger practices will be able to choose to take control of funds to finance a range of local services for their own patients \u00d0 including certain hospital treatments, and the cost to the services of prescriptions and some staff needed for the practice. \n If your GP chooses to join the practice funding scheme, what will it mean? \n - The level of funds will be agreed between your GP and the Department of Health and Social Services. It will take into account the health care needs of all the patients on the practice list \u00d0 for example, the extra requirements of elderly people, patients with special needs, the hospital services likely to be used and so on. \n - Your GP will be able to use the fund to arrange the right treatment for you speedily and effectively. For example, your GP should have greater flexibility to look around for treatment in hospitals which offer the shortest waiting times. The aim is to improve the choice of good quality services available to you and your GP. \n - The practice will be able to use any savings from the fund for your benefit \u00d0 for example, in employing another nurse or buying new diagnostic equipment for the surgery. \n So if your doctor has a practice fund, will you still get the treatment you need? \n - Yes. GPs will get sufficient funds to enable them to provide full and proper treatment for their patients. Even if the practice overspends its funds, there is no question of people not getting the treatment they need.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "59789f99-c99f-4945-9c97-bb553fa191a5", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.668982+00:00"}
{"text": "<Career guide>\n\n\n<$A>\n Career decisions: Working out the next step \n  Making decisions about your future career can be daunting, but if you do nothing to plan your future, you can be sure that nothing will happen. Few graduates arrive at a satisfying career by chance so read this section to get some advice on how to make sound career decisions.  \n It 's your choice \n Making a career decision is something that you must do for yourself \u00d0 but it 's almost always easier if you enlist the help of friends, family and careers advisers. \n The first step is to realise that YOU have a decision to make and that only YOU can move things along. For instance, talking to a friend or careers adviser will help you to recognise things that you do well, your strengths and weaknesses and to identify other skills such as team work that employers will be looking for when they recruit. \n Ask yourself questions such as: <*> bullet point </*> what are my achievements? <*> bullet point </*> what do my achievements say about me as a person? <*> bullet point </*> what are my strengths and weaknesses? <*> bullet point </*> what sort of job will I find interesting and rewarding? \n While these questions are not paramount in your day to day activities they are quite critical in the process of making the transition from university to employment. You can do it! It is worth the effort to identify your skills and interests, your values and what motivates you. When it comes to selecting jobs and filling in application forms you will spend less time scratching your head in search of an elusive answer and more time providing evidence that you fit the employer 's criteria. You are also likely to be more content with your choice than someone who wanders along waiting for a bolt of lightning to strike them on the way to a lecture. Career choice tends to occur not as a sudden revelation but as a result of a process which you start and you manage. \n   \"If you don't know where you are going, you will probably end up somewhere else.\"   \n Dr LJ Peter, Canadian educator \n  Making your decision \u00d0 overcoming obstacles  \n bold> Getting to know yourself \u00d0 on computer  \n Technology can prove useful here. You need to identify attitudes, personality traits and skills that might help you choose suitable job areas. For example you might know that some of the following are important for you: a) a job working with people \u00d0 advising, guiding them or caring for their physical and/or emotional health. b) a job where you want to see the end product of your endeavours such as project management, management consultancy etc. c) a job where you need to motivate, manage and develop other staff and colleagues. d) a job which is fast moving and change-orientated. \n  Prospect Planner  is a powerful interactive computer package which can help you analyse all these factors in a rational logical manner. It allows you to build up profiles of the skills you want to use in work; your personal values in relation to work and will, if you ask it, provide lists of jobs that match the profiles you construct. \n However, a word of caution \u00d0 the programme is great but be prepared to get a long list of jobs. Some may seem at the least mildly entertaining, others somewhat strange, but remember the computer applies logic based on the information you input. Thinking about why it suggests you should become a member of the clergy, an accountant or even a careers adviser can be useful because it will enable you to identify the pattern and skill of matching yourself to jobs. If you can make this connection you are well on the way to making informed and successful career decisions. Finally,  Prospect Planner  lets you store and/or print off the work you do. Do speak to a careers adviser if you are unsure about any part of your printout.  Prospects Planner  is available in the Careers Service. \n  Getting to know yourself \u00d0 on paper  \n If you prefer a less dynamic approach, Queen 's Careers Service has several good books to guide you through this process. For example,  No idea about a career?  by Chris Phillips or  What colour is your parachute?  by R. Nelson Bolles may be most appropriate for your needs. Do try both approaches to find out which tool \u00d0 computer or paper \u00d0 best suits you. \n   Graduate employment  \n In recent years graduate employment has changed and the signs are that change will continue. Driven by technology and competition, organisations tend to be leaner and flatter in structure with a focus on results. The small business sector continues to expand with a strong emphasis on entrepreneurship. So whilst the traditional areas of graduate employment may have changed, there is still significant demand for graduates, particularly those who can present an effective combination of academic achievement, work experience and personal and employability skills. \n  Skills employers look for  \n Remember that employers want to recruit the best graduate for the job. To enable them to distinguish between applicants they ask that graduates offer a profile of skills relevant to work and progression within it. The current buzz word for this profile is 'employability skills' \u00d0 ie skills which are work related and central to job success. \n Broadly these skills can be views under four main headings: \n  Specialist  \n It helps to be an expert at something, eg marketing, tax accounting, family law, aerospace engineering, marine biology, organisational psychology. \n  Generalist  \n It helps to have general business skills and knowledge, eg finance/basic accounting, written communication, problem solving, use of IT. \n  Connected  \n It helps to be a team player, eg management skills, meetings skills, negotiation skills, networking skills, presentation skills. \n  Self-reliant  \n It helps to be able to work alone as well as with others, eg confidence, self-awareness, action planning, political awareness. \n  Developing your employability skills  \n These skills are essentially work-related, central to job success and you should consider ways of developing them. Here are some examples of how to develop them: 1. Register for the Skills to Succeed programme which has been developed and is delivered by staff from the Careers Service. The programme lasts for two hours per week over one semester and will help you to: <*> bullet point </*> identify the skills developed through study and part-time work <*> bullet point </*> develop knowledge in relation to employer expectations of graduates <*> bullet point </*> demonstrate employability skills <*> bullet point </*> increase your awareness of the range of graduate opportunities available to you <*> bullet point </*> acquire increased confidence and competence at handling selection methods used by graduate recruiters. \n Successful completion of this course will lead to the award of a University Certificate in Career Management and Employability Skills. \n 2. A level 2 undergraduate module in career management and employability skills is available to second year students during first and second semesters. This provides a sound basis for if you are considering taking a year out on placement or if you want to build employability skills into your degree. Find out more about the Skills to Succeed programme and the module in Career Management and Employability from Queen 's Careers Service. \n 3. Consider building the learning for Work module into your degree. This is available to Level 2 and 3 students as a free-standing module. It provides undergraduates with an opportunity to develop the skills and competences they will need in their future careers through project work. Find out more from the Centre for the Enhancement of Learning and Teaching (CELT), 75 University www.qub.ac.uk/celt/module. \n 4. Get involved with a student society of Student Consultative Committee (SCC). Remember \u00d0 you will need to be active in these groups in order to develop skills. Turning up to a meeting isn't enough. \n 5. Make the most of casual or part-time jobs. You will often get more responsibility if you ask for it or demonstrate that you can cope with it. Go on in-house training courses if available \u00d0 a customer care or telesales course might give you an edge over others at interview. \n The Students ' Jobshop@Queen 's can help you find part-time work \u00d0 www.qub.ac.uk/jobshop. \n 6. You can develop your skills through social activities related to your personal interests, eg coaching or captaining sports teams, fund raising for a charity, doing voluntary youth or community work. \n 7. Use vacations constructively \u00d0 get a casual job, or better still and undergraduate vacation placement (read  Work Experience Bulletin  regularly) or travel. Look for and make the most of opportunities available \u00d0 employers are not impressed with the  'I didn't know about that'  approach. Section 4, Work experience may give you some ideas, as will the  Queen 's Guide to Work Experience  , available from the Work Placement Centre, 8 Malone Road. \n 8. Take a year out \u00d0 an invaluable way of developing the skills that employers seek. The Careers Service advertises semester and year out placements throughout the year. \n 9. Be aware that through studying for your degree you can develop, for example, time management, team work and presentation skills. \n Remember developing work-related and interpersonal skills and enjoying your time at university are not mutually exclusive. Just think about what you can do on a day to day basis and relate it to the bigger picture \u00d0 easy when you think about it! \n  To summarise  \n There are several resources available to help you to make career decisions. It will help if you: \n  1. Begin to plan your future early. \n This sounds as boring as watching paint dry but it doesn't have to be. Many things you do at university will help you to make decisions. The trick is to be able to see these activities for what they are and for what they can say about you to an employer (a moment 's thought might get you an interview for a job). \n  2. Don't expect a career to just happen. \n Few people can truthfully say that their career decisions have been due completely to chance. YOU are the lead player in this process and YOU need to make decisions. \n  3. Spend as much time thinking about yourself and what you want from a career as you do in looking for jobs.  \n Remember that the employers will be matching individuals, not degree transcripts, to jobs. \n  4. Are not afraid of getting it wrong.  \n It is difficult with limited work experience to choose a career. Remember that your first employer and job are unlikely to be your last. As work patterns become more flexible and change to meet market pressures, the likelihood of a job and employer for life becomes less usual. You will probably find that any job, even if you decide that it isn't going to be a career will develop skills that can be transferred to other employment situations. \n  5. Always have a  back-up plan  \n  Further sources of help  \n Look in the bibliography file in the Careers Service for the full range of books available on career choice and decision making.  No idea about a career?  by Chris Phillips and  What colour is your parachute?  by R. Nelson Bolles provide useful starting points. \n  Work experience  \n  Work experience is an essential part of your university experience. It adds value to your degree and greatly improves your employment prospects.  \n  What counts as work experience?  \n The term 'work experience' is used as an umbrella phrase to cover a wide range of experiences. It could be: <*> bullet point </*> formal work experience \u00d0 as in a sandwich placement within your degree <*> bullet point </*> informal \u00d0 as in summer work, a vacation course, work shadowing or a part-time job <*> bullet point </*> related to extra-curricular activities \u00d0 for example, the student who works on the student newspaper is gaining real insight into journalism. Similarly, participating in the Tutoring in Schools Scheme or being a leader with a youth organisation will be considered relevant experience for entry to postgraduate teacher training. \n In an ideal world the best kind of work experience is that which is directly relevant to your future career plans, for instance: <*> bullet point </*> the history student who wants to pursue a career in museum work and spends a vacation working in the Public Records Office <*> bullet point </*> the engineering student who works one summer with a local engineering company and the second summer doing an IAESTE engineering placement overseas. \n Obviously it helps if you have focused on your future plans because then you can try to shape your work experience. You will find that to get into certain careers an element of work experience will be essential \u00d0 social work and clinical psychology are good examples. \n However, not every student will be able to set up this 'ideal' kind of experience, so don't underrate that part-time job in the supermarket, the bar work, or the temporary clerical job. They all count towards giving you an external perspective and help you develop skills for the workplace.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "397f0ca3-ee51-4f79-90e1-4b8b42cc2cf5", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.670121+00:00"}
{"text": "<Social services>\n\n\n<$A>\n<$B>\n Developing a Policy for Public Participation \n Introduction \n All of us have used, are using or might in the future use our health and personal social services. \n These services often have an important effect on the health and wellbeing of those of us who use them. So, if you live within our area you will want us to provide an efficient service which meets you needs as closely as possible, with the resources we have available. Generally, people who get help from health and social services make much better progress when these services take account of their hopes and needs. \n In the past, we did not always realise the importance of giving: - you, the public in general; - service users (those of you who use our services); - carers (people who look after their relatives or friends); a say in the development of our health and social services. However, the recent reforms in health and personal social services were based on the belief that involving the three groups mentioned above in decisions about the planning, sharing out and delivering of our services is vital in developing really effective services. One government after another has said how important this involvement is. \n In his introduction to  'Involving Users: Improving the Delivery of Local Public Services'  , the Minister for Public Service said:\n   \"This government is committed to modernising our public services: to improving their quality and making them more responsive to users....public services should consult and involve the public. That is because we believe in finding out direct from people what their experiences of public services are, and how they could be improved.\"   (National Consumer Council, Consumer Congress and First Unit in the Cabinet Office, 1999.)  \n In Northern Ireland, the 'Code of Practice on Openness in the Health and Personal Social Services' (DHSS, 1996) makes a clear commitment to  'providing ways to make it easier for the public to be involved in making decision about their health and personal social services care' . The 'Well into 2000' document says 'the full participation of individuals and local communities is essential in planning and implementing strategies to enhance their own health and wellbeing'. (Well into 2000 and the Regional Strategy; DHSS, 1998.) The Equality Commission says that discussion with appropriate individuals and groups should be a central part of the policy process. (Equality Commission for Northern Ireland: Consultation Paper; Guidelines, Public Authority Schemes, 1999.) \n The Social Services Inspectorate (Northern Ireland) has published 'Standards for Consumer Involvement in Community Care Service, (Social Services Inspectorate, DHSS, 1999.) This was based on work with disabled people and other involved organisations, and it included field testing (market research) of the standards in one community trust in each board 's area. The field testing found evidence that people who used their services also got involved in planning their own care, and got partly involved in planning services at a practical level. They found little evidence of the public being involved, at planning and policy levels, in health boards or trusts. Also, there weren't any clearly-defined policies for the public (particularly those who use these services to get involved. (Consumer Involvement: Changing Attitudes; DHSS, 1997.) This is likely to be the situation across nearly all health and personal social services. \n We recognise the interest that the public have shown when we make changes to our health and personal social services. Recent public involvement in discussions about the future role of local hospitals shows how much interest the public have and how much they want to be involved in decisions affecting these hospitals. Some of you who use our services (services users) and your carers want more of a way in your own treatment and care, and in the development and delivery of our services generally. \n The introduction of community-care services gives individual service users and carers the chance to be more fully involved in the decisions we make about their own care and support services. A group of users and carers, who worked with our officers on issues about public involvement, asked to be continually involved in our decision making through formal processes. (The Voice of Users and Carers; EHSSB, 1995.) For our service reviews, like those on day services for people with physical disabilities, and services for people with eyesight problems, w have had contributions from those of you using our services and your carers. \n More professionals (like doctors) are beginning to understand how important it is to listen to their patients or clients. This is because professionals do not always 'know best'. The patient or client and their carers understand their own situation best, and the professionals should remember this when they plan the treatment or care. \n Aims of our policy \n The following are the aims of our policy to involve you in our decision making. They are to: - show our commitment to making sure that you have an important effect on our policy and the way we develop and deliver our services; - make sure that we set up effective and appropriate procedures to involve you, including members of ethnic and other minority groups, in a real and ongoing discussion about health and personal social services; - make sure that we keep you informed about the resources (like money and staff) that we have available for health and social services, and the issues that we need to consider when we decide how to share out these resources; - encourage and help you to get more involved in our decision making; - decide how much you need to be involved for us to make sure that our services respond to your needs; - make sure that if you want it, you can get involved in developing our policies, services and delivery in ways that meet your needs and circumstances; and - make sure that we regularly monitor and measure how well our public-involvement policy works. \n Principles \n - We and HPSS Trusts in our area (providers of health and personal social services) will encourage public involvement at all levels. \n - We and HPSS Trusts in our area will encourage two-way involvement, so that you can ask questions and reply to the questions that we ask. \n - The way we involve you will depend on each situation. \n - We will try to make sure that we listen to different views, including those of minority groups. \n - The way we involve you will be real, important and ongoing. \n - We will have systems in place (for example, a website for giving your views) that allow you to contribute to our policies effectively. \n - We will respond to any worries that you have, where we can. \n - We will keep any promises that we made to you about involving you in our decision making. \n - We will try to make sure that we take account of all your interests and groups when we make decision which affect you. \n - Your involvement will have clear results which we will monitor and share fully with everyone involved. \n - We will use clear, jargon-free language in all our communication with the general public. \n Who are the public? \n All of you who live within the area that we cover make up our 'public'. This means individuals, families, groups, organisations and communities who use our services now, or might do in the future, and who have an interest in how we provide and develop our services. When we talk about 'the public' in this paper, we mean those of you who live in our area, including those of you who use our services and your carers. We want to make sure that our public involvement process is open to all of you who want to contribute your views, including those of you from ethnic and other minority groups. \n We realise that as well as individuals giving us their views, the public make their views known in a number of ways, including through their elected representatives, voluntary organisations and community groups. Our policy is not to interfere with the well-established role of public representatives, voluntary organisations and groups in the way they represent their members. Instead, our policy is to give you extra ways to strengthen your involvement, and public involvement in general, by building on existing methods. \n What do we mean by involvement? \n Public involvement is about involving the people who make decisions and provide our services with the ordinary person, in matters that affect and interest them all. The 'Well into 2000' document (see page 2 for details) makes it clear that involvement means the full participation (taking part) of individuals and local communities in planning services policies and putting them into practice. \n We believe that the following main points are vital if we are to have full public involvement. \n 1 Information \n If we are to get the public involved, we need to provide clear and relevant information in a range of appropriate formats, for example, on audio tape. The DHSS 's 'Code of Practice on Openness in the Health and Personal Social Services' gives details about the information that you, the public need. This includes information about: - the services we provide, the targets and standards we set, the results we achieve, the costs and how good our services are; - our important policy suggestions or proposed changes in the way we deliver our services; - how we and our trusts communicate with the public; - how we and our trusts are managed and funded; and - how you can contact the Eastern Health and Social Services Council, and the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Complaints (the Ombudsman). \n We have a policy for producing information in a way that suits those of you with specific needs, for example, on audio tape and translated into other languages, if you ask for it. \n 2 Consultation (discussion) \n This means that we listen to: - you (the public); - people using our services (service users); and - your carers; to find out and answer their questions. The Equality Commission identified four main reasons for consultation (in their 'Consultation Paper: Guidelines, Public Authority Schemes, 1999). \n These four main reasons are to: - work out current policies, services, functions or laws; - get your vies on proposed policy, service and law developments; - explore new ideas and issues, and how they affect the public; and - develop policies on questions that affect everyone. \n Our consultation policy will include discussions through our existing systems and processes, such as the work of our policy-planning teams and our links with public-representative groups. It will also include 'one-off' arrangements such as public meetings, work groups and a citizens ' jury. This whole process will need a flexible approach that considers the needs of the individuals, groups or communities that we are consulting. \n  Citizens ' juries are made up of between 12 and 16 members of the public, who are chosen at random from the electoral register. They hear evidence from a range of specialist witnesses on a particular topic over several days and make a report which is usually    published   . The jury members then reach their own conclusions. They do not have to be experts in the topic they are considering or belong to any interest group. \n 3 Participation (taking part) \n In its widest sense, participation means that the public, service users and carers will have a lot of influence over our decision making. We will keep them all fully informed before, while and after we make our decisions. Their views, experiences, needs and understanding will be central to our decision making.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "2ee92117-a785-4a86-82e9-8214d31c0e7e", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.671214+00:00"}
{"text": "<University legislation>\n\n\n<$A>\n  FOREWORD BY THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION  \n The White Paper on Education -  Charting Our Education Future  - published in April, 1995, sets out the key principles and policy directions which will underpin the future development of education in our country into the next century, including the development of university and other forms of higher education. \n The White Paper articulates the principles and considerations which will underpin the future development of higher education, including the specific principles and considerations relating to university legislation. \n The White Paper also promised that I would issue a position paper outlining further my approach to legislation for the universities and to the principles underpinning it. This is the position paper. Instead of confining the circulation of the position paper to the universities and the Higher Education Authority, as signalled in the White Paper, I have decided that it should be published and given a wide circulation to all those who are interested and concerned about this important topic. \n My period in office, as Minister for Education, has been characterised by an openness and a willingness to engage in dialogue and consultation, based on the conviction and the belief that real change and reform in our educational structures and systems will be most effectively achieved through this process. It was this conviction and belief that led me into the extensive, and most valuable, process of consultation which preceded the publication of the White Paper on Education. The publication of this position paper on university legislation is a further and manifest indication of my commitment to openness and dialogue in the formulation and implementation of important policy proposals. \n We are now in the implementation phase of educational change in this country. The White Paper has set out the policy directions and principles which would underpin this change. This position paper sets out in greater detail the practical implementation of the White Paper principles and policy directions in relation to the important topic of university legislation. This detailed implementation derives from, and is in accord with, the policy directions set out in the White Paper published in April, 1995. \n Accordingly, this position paper sets out my thinking and that of my Department in relation to the implementation of these policy directions and principles at this time. \n I would like to acknowledge the advice which has been given to me, through my Department, by the heads of the universities. In all cases this advice was given on a personal basis and it does not imply the agreement, explicit or implicit, of the relevant individuals or institutions to the proposals in this document. The position paper sets out my thinking on the issues involved - but in preparing this paper I have been immeasurably assisted by the constructive advice which has been freely given to me. Niamh Bhreathnach, T.D. Minister for Education \n  CONTEXT  \n 1. The Government 's White Paper on education -  Charting Our Education Future  - published in April, 1995, sets out the key principles and policy directions which will underpin the future development of higher education. The White Paper seeks to clarify the role of the state in relation to education and underlines the empowerment of colleges and institutions of education to nurture and promote their particular values, traditions and character and to set out their philosophical approaches to education. \n 2. The overall policy approach to higher education was set out in the White Paper in terms of seeking to balance institutional autonomy with the needs of public policy and accountability, having due regard to the respective rights and responsibilities of the State and the institutions. A number of considerations are set out, in the White Paper (page 88), which will underpin this approach; \n the promotion of equality in and through higher education \n the recognition of the legitimate autonomy of institutions, particularly in relation to determining the educational aims and content of programmes \n the promotion of the highest standards of quality \n the preservation of diversity and balance of provision, within the system, while avoiding unnecessary overlap or duplication \n the development of flexible strategies to meet the expanding and changing demand for higher education \n the promotion and facilitation of the key leadership role of higher education as a source of social and economic development, together with the need to ensure continuing relevance to the needs of the economy and the promotion of links between institutions and their social and economic environments \n the continuous development of a framework of accountability for individual institutions and for the higher education system as a whole \n the provision of an appropriate legislative framework, which affirms well-established values while reflecting the role of higher education in modern society. \n 3. The White Paper sets out a range of initiatives and policy directions to give practical expression to these principles. Specifically, in relation to legislation, the White Paper contains a specific Government commitment to the introduction of a new legislative framework for universities. This legislation would cover three broad areas. \n 4. First, it would deal with governing bodies. The White Paper indicates that there would be a broadening of the composition of governing bodies of universities in order to provide for representation from society and the economy. In addition, academic staff, non-academic staff and students would have statutory representation on all governing bodies coupled with appropriate provisions to ensure gender balance on governing bodies. The White Paper indicates that there would be statutory provision for Ministerial nominees on all governing bodies. \n 5. Second, the White Paper indicates that legislation would amend the National University of Ireland legislation on the basis of proposals put forward by the Senate of the National University of Ireland. \n 6. Third, the White Paper indicates that more comprehensive legislation for the university sector as whole would also be introduced. The White Paper affirms a number of the principles upon which this legislation will be based namely:-\nregard for proper institutional autonomy coupled with appropriate public accountability affirmation of the ethos and tradition of universities, together with changes, to reflect the role of universities in modern society preservation of the diversity of universities the enhancement of the developmental role of universities \n 7. The White Paper also states that the legislation would seek to set out in appropriate form the roles and functions of governing bodies and executive structures respectively. The role of the university president as accounting officer would also be set out. \n 8. These are the policy commitments in the White Paper. They are now being delivered. \n 9. The White Paper stated that the minister would issue a position paper outlining further her approach to legislation and the principles underpinning it. This is the position paper. The White Paper envisaged that the position paper would be circulated within the university communities. However, this position paper is being given the widest possible circulation, given the obvious and clear public and widespread interest in this important issue. \n 10. The position paper builds upon, and seeks to give effect to the policy directions and principles articulated in the White Paper. \n 11. The White Paper was produced following an extensive, and in many respects unprecedented, process of consultation and dialogue with all the partners in education, including the universities. The National Education Convention was a notable element of the consultative process. The Convention, which included representatives of the universities as well as other concerned interests, discussed the issues involved in future university legislation and there was agreement that legislation should allow for flexibility permitting diversity of structure and practice, and acknowledging the ethos of individual institutions. There is a broad and solidly based foundation of consensus for these fundamental principles and policy directions. This gives considerable grounds for optimism and confidence in the detailed elaboration of these principles and policy directions into specific legislative proposals for the university sector. \n 12. The commitment to publish a further position paper on university legislation in the White Paper, and now the publication of that position paper, is a manifestation of the Minister 's continuing commitment to consultation, openness and dialogue in the formulation and implementation of policy. An important purpose of the position paper, is to base discussion and dialogue on fact. \n 13. The legislative proposals for the university sector are indeed significant. They contain the potential to equip the universities as we enter the twenty first century with a new and robust legislative foundation. They also have the potential to lay the ground work for a new, and in many respects innovative relationship between universities and the wider society, including the State. This relationship will be one which respects the autonomy of institutions and the legitimate rights of the wider society. \n 14. Building from the policy position, principles and directions set out in the White Paper, the following sections of this position paper set out the Minister 's thinking at this time in relation to the implementation of those principles and policy directions and their incorporation into legislation. \n 15. Detailed legislative proposals will, of course, have to be approved by the Government. When that is done, they will be debated in both Houses of the Oireachtas. \n  BACKGROUND  \n 16. The concept and nature of the university have always been dynamic. Many of the early European universities evolved from the monastic centres of learning and the cathedral schools. From their origin in the early medieval period the essential role of the universities, that is the generation of knowledge, the development and dissemination of ideas, the promotion of intellectual debate and the fostering of a critical conscience of society, has developed hand in hand with the increasing importance of universities in economic and social life. Indeed, the increasing dependence of modern societies on knowledge has drawn the universities closer to the centre of economic and social decision-making. This is in itself an appropriate reflection of the role of the universities in generating the knowledge and ideas which are increasingly the basis for the development of our society. \n 17. This development has been reflected in the history of universities in Ireland from the foundation of Trinity College in 1592 to the establishment of the National University of Ireland (NUI) in 1908 and the setting up of Dublin City University (DCU) and the University of Limerick (UL) in 1989. St. Patrick 's College, Maynooth, which was established in 1795, became a pontifical university in 1895 and a recognised college of the NUI in 1910. The growth and development of the university sector during the twentieth century is reflected in the growth in the numbers of undergraduate students (just over 4,000 in 1920, 6,000 in 1940, 10,589 in 1960 and 48,794 in 1995), an increasing participation rate, a greatly diversified student body, the widening range of adult and community programmes, the significant increase and diversification in postgraduate and research work, the increasing extent of the interaction between the Irish universities and Irish economic and social development through their links with business and industry, their important contributions to the development of policy in many areas of Irish life and the increasing size of the Exchequer contribution to the running of the universities (<*> pound sign </*> 172 million in 1995). Throughout this period the Irish university institutions have secured and maintained a high international reputation for the quality of their scholarship and the high standards achieved by their students. \n  A NEED FOR FRAMEWORK LEGISLATION  \n 18. Universities, in the role they play in modern society, have come a long way from their early beginnings. Universities, formerly open only to a few, now play a crucial role in society as an integral and mainstream part of our education system. Universities and third-level institutions are acknowledged, nationally and internationally, as key contributors to social, economic and cultural renewal in modern society. Access to university education is no longer the privilege of a few but the realisable objective of many. \n 19. For our young people, universities, as one of the two major components of our higher education system, fulfil the aspiration for higher learning and personal development, building upon the foundations of primary and second-level schooling. For all age-groups in the community, universities provide an opportunity for lifelong learning and continual intellectual, cultural and artistic growth. For the economy, universities provide a resource of skill, enterprise and innovation to meet the needs of agriculture, business, industry, the professions and the public service. For society as a whole, universities contribute, through research and new knowledge, to the generation of the critical thinking and analysis which is essential in any modern, mature democracy.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "2c3733d1-6dfb-4f22-becc-c72762ebd13e", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.671989+00:00"}
{"text": "<Financial prospectus>\n\n\n<$A>\n  Conversion  \n On 21 September, 1994, Irish Permanent Building Society was converted from a building society to a public limited company called Irish Permanent plc. The entire business, property, rights and liabilities of the Society were vested in the Company on that date. Conversion took place in accordance with the terms of the Conversion Scheme, which was overwhelmingly approved by members at the Annual General Meeting on 23 March, 1994. It was the first Irish building society to take advantage of the Building Societies Act, 1989 enabling building societies to convert into public limited companies. Irish Permanent, which continues to be regulated by the Central Bank, now holds a banking licence. \n Some 45,333,300 Free Shares had been validly claimed by 12 August, 1994 and were issued on Conversion to Qualifying Savers and Qualifying Borrowers. According to the records of the Company, a further 20,970,600 Free Shares may fall to be issued pursuant to claims under the Conversion Scheme. Such claims must be received by Irish Permanent on or before 21 September, 1997. \n The Directors estimate that a maximum of 4,533,330 additional Free Shares may be issued as loyalty bonuses to persons of their nominees who validly claimed their Free Shares by 12 August, 1994 and who continue to hold their Free Shares on certain future dates. \n Under the terms of the Conversion Scheme, a cash distribution is payable to certain former members of the Society. The Directors estimate that the cash distribution, which will be charged against reserves and will have no effect on the future dividend policy of the Group, will amount to approximately <*> pound sign </*> 2.6 million in total. \n Under the terms of the Conversion Scheme, the Board has adopted the Employee Share Ownership Plan and the Share Option Scheme. \n  Offer structure  \n The Offer comprises 30,800,000 Ordinary Shares which are being offered at a price of 180 pence per Share. Of these Shares, 27,768,500 Shares are being offered on behalf of Irish Permanent and the balance is being offered on behalf of those persons who by 12 August, 1994 had validly requested the sale of their entitlements to Free Shares on their Free Share Claim Forms. \n Under the Offer, 16,400,000 Offer Shares are being placed firm with institutional investors and 14,400,000 Offer Shares are being placed subject to recall to satisfy valid applications from Qualifying Persons. Of the Offer Shares being placed subject to recall, 1,440,000 Shares (being 10 per cent.) are being reserved to satisfy preferential applications from Qualifying Employees (other than Directors). \n The Offer has been underwritten in full by West Merchant Bank Limited, IBI Corporate Finance Limited, Riada Corporate Finance Limited and Hoare Govett Corporate Finance Limited at the Offer Price.

Its products include mortgages, savings, investments, life assurance and pensions and other retail financial services. \n At 31 December, 1993, Irish Permanent was the largest building society in the Republic of Ireland measured in terms of total assets, profits and reserves. At that date, its total assets of <*> pound sign </*> 2.7 billion (including mortgage loans of <*> pound sign </*> 1.9 billion) represented approximately 35 per cent. of the total assets of <*> pound sign </*> 7.8 billion of all Irish building societies. Irish Permanent is the fourth largest banking group in the Republic of Ireland measured in terms of total assets at 31 December, 1993 and, in the view of the Directors, continues to be the leading provider of residential mortgage finance. \n In 1992 and 1993, Irish Permanent was the leading mortgage lender in the Republic of Ireland. With new mortgage advances of some <*> pound sign </*> 323 million in 1993, it achieved a market share of approximately 24 per cent. in that year. The total of residential mortgage loans outstanding for all credit institutions reporting to the Central Bank in the Republic of Ireland at 31 December, 1993 amounted to approximately <*> pound sign </*> 7.3 billion. Irish Permanent 's residential mortgage portfolio of approximately <*> pound sign </*> 1.7 billion at that date represented some 23 per cent. of such loans. Statistics are, however, not available on the total residential mortgage loans outstanding by all lenders in the market. At 31 December, 1991, 1992 and 1993 respectively, Irish Permanent had a market share of interest-bearing saving balances in the Republic of Ireland in the range of 6-7 per cent. \n  Competitive strengths  \n Irish Permanent 's major competitive strengths which, in the view of the Directors, constitute a sound basis for the Group 's development following flotation, include:\na substantial customer base comprising over 79,000 mortgage accounts and over 590,000 savings and deposit accounts;\nan extensive distribution network comprising 93 branches and 100 agencies in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and a banking subsidiary in the Isle of Man;\na range of complementary mortgage, savings, investments, life assurance and pension products; an experienced and innovative management team; nationally recognised and respected brand names; a committed staff providing a high standard of customer service; strict credit control procedures and prudent lending policies, which have historically resulted in a low level of loan losses;\naccess to the equity and debt capital markets, in the latter case facilitated by the investment grade long term debt rating, A2, as assigned to Irish Permanent by Moody 's Investors Service; and a strong capital base and balance sheet which should facilitate a significant expansion of both current and new activities. \n  Distribution network  \n Irish Permanent has an extensive network of branches and agencies for the distribution of its products and services in the Republic of Ireland. The branch network provides the major point of contact with the majority of Irish Permanent 's customers and is the principal outlet for Irish Permanent 's mortgage, saving and money transmission products and services. \n\n  Prudential Life of Ireland    On 30 June, 1994, Irish Permanent acquired Prudential Life of Ireland, a significant life assurance and pensions business in the Republic of Ireland, at a cost of <*> pound sign </*> 31.9 million (including acquisition costs) out of existing liquid resources. The fair value, including embedded value, of Prudential Life of Ireland at that date amounted to <*> pound sign </*> 29.8 million. The goodwill of <*> pound sign </*> 2.1 million so arising was written off against the reserves of Irish Permanent at 30 June, 1994. No contribution from Prudential Life of Ireland is included in the consolidated profit and loss account of the Group for the six months ended 30 June, 1994. The assets and liabilities of Prudential Life of Ireland are included in the consolidated balance sheet of the Group at 30 June, 1994. \n Prudential Life of Ireland develops, markets and underwrites life assurance policies, pension policies and certain other products, including single premium products, in the Republic of Ireland. Its life assurance products are mainly regular premium unit-linked life assurance protection and savings policies. \n In the year ended 31 December, 1993 and the six months ended 30 June, 1994, Prudential Life of Ireland generated embedded value after tax earnings of <*> pound sign </*> 4.2 million and <*> pound sign </*> 2.4 million respectively. Statutory earnings after tax for the same periods were <*> pound sign </*> 2.5 million and <*> pound sign </*> 1.2 million respectively. \n The Directors intend to account for Prudential Life of Ireland in the accounts of the Group using the embedded value method, but will, also, provide information on statutory earnings. The Directors consider that the embedded value earnings of Prudential Life of Ireland may exhibit greater volatility than the earnings for Irish Permanent 's banking business. \n Further information on the accounting for the life assurance business of Prudential Life of Ireland is set out in the \"Guide to certain life assurance technical terms\" and on page 35 of the Listing Particular. The assumptions made by the Directors in calculating embedded values for Prudential Life or Ireland are set out in the letter from Bacon <*> ampersand </*> Woodrow in Part IV of the Listing Particulars. \n  Guinness <*> ampersand </*> Mahon  \n On 31 August, 1994, Irish Permanent acquired Guinness <*> ampersand </*> Mahon at a cost of <*> pound sign </*> 2.1 million and losses before tax of <*> pound sign </*> 56,000. At 31 December, 1993, Guinness <*> ampersand </*> Mahon had total assets of <*> pound sign </*> 99 million, of which <*> pound sign </*> 67 million were liquid assets. Customer accounts at that date amounted to <*> pound sign </*> 70 million. \n Irish Permanent intends to provide private banking services through Guinness <*> ampersand </*> Mahon. \n  Restrictions on shareholdings  \n In compliance with the Act, the Articles restrict any person from having an interest in 15 per cent. or more of the Company 's issued share capital for a period of five years from the date of Conversion. In addition, the Central Bank must approve any transaction involving the acquisition by a person or persons acting in concert of 10 per cent. or more of the voting rights of Shares of Irish Permanent. \n  Outlook for 1994  \n In 1994, Irish Permanent has continued to write profitable mortgages business without relaxing its stringent lending criteria. However, greater competition in the residential mortgage market has resulted in a lower market share for new business and lower net interest margins for the Group. Although trends since 30 June, 1994 lead the Directors to believe that the second half of the year will, as in previous years, reflect a greater level of lending activity, the Directors anticipate that the net interest margin and the results for this period will continue to reflect the competitive situation. \n Irish Permanent 's performance in retail savings is ahead of budget. Special Savings Accounts and the recently launched Irish Permanent Savings Certificates have proved particularly attractive to investors. As a result of these and other product developments, the Directors are confident that 1994 will show a satisfactory increase in retail deposits. \n Prudential Life of Ireland and Guinness <*> ampersand </*> Mahon will make their first contributions to Group results in the second half of 1994. Prudential Life of Ireland repriced its product range in the early part of the year and is maintaining satisfactory market share. The Directors believe that recent trends in this business indicate that Prudential Life of Ireland will make a satisfactory contribution to Group results in 1994. The Directors believe that the embedded value earnings of Prudential Life of Ireland may be more volatile than the earnings from Irish Permanent 's banking business. The pre-tax results of Prudential Life of Ireland will be accounted for as \"Other operating income\" and will, therefore, have a beneficial impact on the Group 's cost:income ratio. The Directors expect that Guinness <*> ampersand </*> Mahon will report a small loss in 1994. They are, however, confident that Guinness <*> ampersand </*> Mahon can be returned to profitability in 1995. \n The Directors continue to monitor costs closely and expect that operating costs in the second half will be broadly at the same level as in the first half. They continue to target a cost:income ratio of 50 per cent. or below by 1998. \n On the basis of the taxation charge provided in the six months ended 30 June, 1994 and the outlook for the year, the Directors expect that the taxation charge for 1994 will be materially below the standard rate of corporation tax of 40 per cent.. \n In the light of results for the six months ended 30 June, 1994 and trading since that date, the Directors believe that the outcome for 1994 will be satisfactory. \n  Dividends  \n On the basis of current expectations and in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, the Directors intend to recommend a final dividend of 6 pence per Share (net) for the year ending 31 December, 1994. This is not a profit forecast. No interim dividend has been or will be paid in respect of the current financial year. It is intended that the first dividend paid by Irish Permanent will be the recommended final dividend forecast above. This is expected to be paid in April 1995. \n For subsequent financial years, the normal policy of the Directors will be to pay interim dividends in October and final dividends in April in proportions of approximately one-third and two-thirds, respectively, of the total annual dividend. \n On the basis of the above expectations, the annualised dividend for 1994 would be 9 pence per Share (net), equivalent to 12 pence per Share inclusive of the related tax credit at the current rate. This annualised dividend represents a gross yield, at the Offer Price, of approximately 6.67 per cent.. \n The Directors intend, in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, to pursue a progressive dividend policy which should produce real increases in dividends per Share subject to real growth in underlying profitability. In determining dividend policy, the Directors will have particular regard to the stability of the gross dividend taking into account the related tax credit.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "88380585-366f-4d86-86ba-96af23cdaaae", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.673050+00:00"}
{"text": "<Annual report>\n\n\n<$A>\n  REPORT OF THE REMUNERATION <*> ampersand </*> COMPENSATION COMMITTEE TO THE BOARD  \n Throughout the year, Irish Permanent plc had procedures in place which met with the Best Practice Provisions as set out in Sections A and B of the Irish Stock Exchange 's Listing Rules requirements on Directors ' remuneration. \n  Remuneration <*> ampersand </*> Compensation Committee  \n The Remuneration and Compensation Committee comprises John Bourke (Chairman), Eileen Lemass and Patrick O'Neill, all of whom are non-Executive Directors. The Committee is responsible for the formulation of the Group 's policy on senior executive remuneration. It considers and determines salaries and other terms of remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior executives. The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Board of Directors meeting with the Chairman in absentia. The Committee meets about four times a year, although more frequent meetings may be held if required. \n  Remuneration Policy  \n The Group 's policy on senior executive remuneration is to reward its executives competitively, having regard to the comparative marketplace in Ireland and the United Kingdom, in order to ensure that they are properly motivated to perform in the best interest of the shareholders. Advice is sought by the Committee from external consultants. \n  Non-Executive Directors  \n Non-Executive Directors are remunerated by way of Directors ' fees only, full details of which are disclosed in note 37 on page 47 of the financial statements. \n  Executive Directors ' Remuneration  \n The elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors are basic salary and benefits, short-term performance bonuses, pensions, participation in the Share Option Scheme, participation in the Long-term Cash Bonus Scheme and the provision of mortgage loans. Each of these elements is discussed below and full details of the Executive Directors ' remuneration is set out in note 37 on page 47 of the financial statements. \n  Salary <*> ampersand </*> Benefits  \n The basic salary of Executive Directors is reviewed annually having regard to competitive market practice. Employment-related benefits primarily comprise a company car. \n  Short-term Performance Bonus  \n Short-term performance bonus awards in any year are determined by the Committee by reference to criteria which are set by the Committee and by reference to the overall profit performance of the Group. The awards range from 0 per cent to a maximum of 50 per cent of basic salary in any one financial year. \n  Pensions  \n Executive Directors participate in a group defined benefit pension scheme. Pension benefits are determined solely in relation to basic salary. \n  Share Option Scheme  \n Executive Directors, in common with other senior executives, participate in the Share Option Scheme which was adopted on 21 September 1994. Under the Scheme, the Committee is entitled to select executives to participate in the Scheme. The terms of the Scheme provide that options shall be exercisable at the higher of the market value per share on the day preceding the date of grant of the option or its nominal value. The aggregate exercise price of options quoted under the Scheme may not exceed four times an executive 's emoluments. Shares representing not more than five per cent of the shares for the time being in issue may be issued under the Scheme. Options may only be exercised if the Group meets certain earnings per share targets based upon growth in earnings per share over a three year period following the grant of any option. \n  Long-term Cash Bonus Scheme  \n Prior to Conversion, the Group operated a Long-term Cash Bonus Scheme ('The Scheme') which was terminated on 30 June 1994 and was then replaced by the Share Option Scheme. The participants in the Scheme are eight senior members of management, including the three Executive Directors. Payment will be made in 1997 of IR <*> pound sign </*> 2.02 million (being IR <*> pound sign </*> 1,633 million plus interest accrued thereon). This is in accordance with the decision of the Board made in 1994, on the basis of expert external advice, which determined the amount which was due under the Scheme. Payment was conditional upon the Group meeting pre-determined performance criteria for the five financial years 1992 to 1996 which have now been achieved. \n  Mortgage Loans to Directors  \n Any mortgage loan to an Executive Director of Irish Permanent plc up to IR <*> pound sign </*> 50,000 is charged at 4 <*> per cent sign </*> which is the reduced rate of interest applicable to mortgage loans to Irish Permanent staff. Where applicable, the balance of any mortgage loan in excess of IR <*> pound sign </*> 50,000 to an Executive Director is subject to Irish Permanent 's normal terms and conditions for borrowers. \n  Directors ' Service Contracts  \n The Executive Directors operate under service contracts which may be terminated by the provision of two years ' notice by either party which is in accordance with the normal practice of companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. \n  STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS ' RESPONSIBILITIES  \n Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business. \n The Directors are responsible for keeping proper books of account which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1990, and all Regulations to be construed as one with those Acts. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. \n  REPORT BY THE AUDITORS TO IRISH PERMANENT plc ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS  \n In addition to our audit of the financial statements, we have reviewed the Directors ' statements, on pages 10 and 11 on the Company 's compliance with the paragraphs of the Code of Best Practice specified for our review by the Irish Stock Exchange and their adoption of the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. The objective of our review is to draw attention to non compliance with Listing Rules 12.43 (j) and 12.43 (v). \n We carried out our review in accordance with guidance issued by the Auditing Practices Board. The guidance does not require us to perform the additional work necessary to, and we do not, express any opinion on the effectiveness of either the Company 's system of internal financial control or its corporate governance procedures nor on the ability of the Company to continue in operational existence. \n  Opinion:  \n With respect to the Directors ' statements on internal control on pages 10 and 11, and going concern on page 11, in our opinion the Directors have provided the disclosures required by the Listing Rule referred to above and such statements are not inconsistent with the information of which we are aware from our audit work on the financial statements. \n Based on enquiry of certain Directors and officers of the Company, and examination of relevant documents, in our opinion the Directors ' statements on pages 10 and 11 appropriately reflect the Company 's compliance with the other paragraphs of the Code specified for our review by Listing Rule 12.43 (j). \n  AUDITORS ' REPORT  \n  To the membership of Irish Permanent plc  \n We have audited the financial statements on pages 20 to 49. \n  Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors in relation to the financial statements:  \n As described on page 17 the Company 's Directors are responsible for the preparation of financial statements. It is our responsibility to form an independent opinion, based on our audit, of those statements and to report our opinion to you. \n  Basis of opinion:  \n We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group 's circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. \n We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements. \n  Opinion:  \n In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at 31 December 1996 and of the profit of the Group for the year then ended, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1990 and all Regulations to be construed as one with those Acts. \n We have obtained all the information and explanations we considered necessary for the purposes of our audit. In our opinion, proper books of account have been kept by the Company. The balance sheet of the Company at 31 December 1996 is in agreement with the books of account. \n In our opinion, the information given in the Directors ' Report on pages 9 to 14 is consistent with the financial statements. \n The net assets of the Company as stated in the balance sheet on page 21 are more than half of its called up share capital and, in our opinion, on that basis there did not exist at 31 December 1996 a financial situation which, under section 40(1) of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1983, would require the convening of an extraordinary general meeting of the Company. \n  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  \n  1 Statement of Accounting Policies  \n  A Basis of preparation  \n The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, in accordance with the Companies Acts 1963 to 1990, the European Communities (Credit Institutions: Accounts) Regulations 1992, and with applicable Financial Reporting Standards. \n  B Basis of consolidation  \n The Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, and of its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 December 1996. \n The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired during the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition. Goodwill arising on acquisition of shares in subsidiary undertakings or assets of other businesses, being the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of the Company 's share of net tangible assets acquired, is written off against reserves in the year of acquisition. \n  C Long-term assurance business  \n In order to reflect the different nature of the Group 's and policyholders ' interests in the long-term assurance assets, the value of the long-term assurance assets attributable to the Group and the value of the long-term assets and liabilities attributable to policyholders are classified under separate headings in the consolidated balance sheet. \n The amount shown as long-term assurance assets attributable to shareholders is determined based on a prudent assessment of the embedded value. The embedded value is the present value of statutory earnings expected to emerge in the future from policies currently in force, together with the net tangible assets of the business. In determining this value, assumptions regarding future mortality rates, lapse rates, surrender rates, investment returns, solvency margins and levels of expenses are made based on the experience of the business. This value is determined on the advice of independent qualified actuaries and is included separately in the consolidated balance sheet. \n Movements in the value of the Group 's long-term assurance assets attributable to shareholders, grossed up for taxation at the standard corporation tax rate, are included as other operating income in the consolidated profit and loss account. \n  D Tangible fixed assets  \n Land, freehold premises and leasehold premises with unexpired terms in excess of 50 years are stated at cost. It is the policy of the Company to maintain these properties in good repair and it is considered that residual values are such that depreciation is not significant. Insofar as depreciation has not been written off these assets, the Company has not complied with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No.12, because, in the opinion of the Directors, the amount involved is not material.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "30474c17-ee2e-4e8b-9788-b38d1542cd5f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.674059+00:00"}
{"text": "<Planning regulations>\n\n\n<$A>\n   LOCAL GOVERNMENT (PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT) REGULATIONS 1994 (S. I. NO. 86 OF 1994)   \n Your attention is directed to the above Regulations made by the Minister for the Environment. These regulations will replace all existing regulations under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts 1963 to 1993 and will come into effect on 16th May 1994 (apart from parts X and XIII which relate to certain development by Local Authorities and State Authorities). \n The attached Schedule sets out the main changes and new provisions. \n Copies of the regulations may be purchased from the Government Publications Sales Office, Sun Alliance House, Molesworth Street, Dublin 2. \n  Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994 \n Main changes and new provisions \n Planning applications  \n Applicants for planning permission will, in the case of applications made on or after 16th May, 1994, have to publish notice in a newspaper and erect a site notice. Up to now, applicants have generally had a choice between the two forms of notice. \n Any submissions or observations made to a planning authority about a planning application received on or after 16th May, 1994 will have to be available for public inspection along with the application itself. At the moment, only some planning authorities make submissions or observations available for inspection. \n A planning authority will have power to declare a planning application invalid, and to return the fee and documents to the applicant, where it considers that the application is seriously deficient by reference to the requirements of the Regulations. \n The right to make submissions or observations to a planning authority about a planning application will not, where the development relates to an activity requiring a licence from the Environmental Protection Agency, extend to matters concerning the risk of environmental pollution from the activity. Such matters will be within the remit of the Agency. \n  Publication of weekly lists by planning authorities and An Bord Plean&/ala  \n The current requirement on planning authorities to produce a weekly list of planning applications received will be extended to cover applications decided during the week. \n There will be a new requirement for An Bord Plean&/ala to produce a weekly list of appeals received and decided. \n Planning authorities and An Bord Plean&/ala will have to make lists available by not later than the third working day after the week to which they relate. \n The planning authority 's list must be displayed at the authority 's office, and in public libraries in the authority's area, for two months, and can also be displayed at any other locations the authority considers appropriate, or published in a newspaper. \n An Bord Plean&/ala 's list has to be displayed at the Board 's offices for a month. \n Copies of the lists must be made available during the display period, free or for a reasonable fee. \n  New categories of exempted development  \n Planning permission will not be needed for the use of a house as a residence for up to 6 people with a mental or physical disability and up to 2 resident carers. \n Erection of one satellite dish on, or within the curtilage of, a dwellinghouse won't need planning permission, provided that: the diameter of the dish does not exceed 1 metre, the dish is not placed on, or in front of, the front wall of the house, or on the front roof slope or higher than the highest part of the roof. \n Clarification of the position of \"Bed and Breakfast\" accommodation - use of up to 4 bedrooms for that purpose won't need planning permission unless the planning permission which authorised the premises in question prohibits or restricts such use. \n Maintenance, improvement, reconstruction or restoration of inland waterways by statutory undertakers will be exempted development. \n Certain minor works by Government Departments and OPW, such as erecting temporary structures for visits of foreign dignitaries, won't need planning permission. \n Provision of stables with an area of less than 100 square metres and of greyhound kennels with an area less than 50 square metres will, subject to certain conditions and limitations, be exempted development. \n  New restrictions on exemption  \n The laying out and use of land as a gold course or a pitch and putt course will not be exempted development. \n The erection of a satellite dish on a building listed for preservation in the Development Plan will not be exempted development. The display of advertisements, except \"For Sale/To Let\" signs or small \"brass plate\" type signs or statutory notices, on such buildings will require planning permission. \n The exemption for demolition will not apply to a building which forms part of a terrace of buildings, or which abuts on another building in separate ownership. [Demolition of listed buildings already requires planning permission.] \n There will be an overall limit of 5 square metres on the area of advertisements which may be displayed on the front of a building on a business premises. \n There will be an overall limit of 25 square metres on the area of garages, stores, sheds, etc. which can be built as exempted development within the curtilage of a dwellinghouse, and exemption won't apply if the amount of open space to the side or rear of the house would be reduced to less than 25 square metres. \n The exemption for constructing an extension to the rear of a dwellinghouse will not apply if the amount of open space at the rear of the house would be reduced to less than 25 square metres. Any previous extensions will have to be taken into account in applying the limit of 23 square metres on the floor area of exempted extensions to the rear of a house. \n Only one \"For Sale/To Let\" sign will be allowed on a property. \n There will be a height limit of 40 metres on navigational equipment constructed or erected as exempted development. \n Use of land as a burial ground will no longer be exempted development. \n  Fees for planning applications  \n There will be a new exemption from application fees for voluntary housing groups. \n Planning applications for the retention of structures constructed without planning permission or the continuance of a use instituted without permission will be subject to one and a half times the normal fee. \n  New procedure of public notice and comment for certain local authority development  \n This procedure will apply to categories of development specified in the Regulations, including construction of houses and other dwellings, certain road works, bridges and tunnels, waste water treatment works, water intake and treatment works, dams and reservoirs, swimming pools, landfill sites, and other waste disposal installations and facilities, burial grounds, fire stations, libraries, and most other development costing more than <*> pound sign </*> 50,000. \n It will not apply, however, to maintenance or repair works, development needed in response to an emergency, or development which is already subject to requirements as to public notice and participation (such as Environmental Impact Assessment procedures). \n The procedure will involve: publication of newspaper notice of the proposed development by the local authority, and giving of notice of the proposal to specified bodies, availability for public inspection of plans and particulars of the proposed development, an opportunity for interested persons and bodies to make submissions to the planning authority about the proposal, preparation of a report on the proposed development, by the local authority addressing (inter alia) issues raised by those who made submissions, submission of the report to the elected members of the local authority, and giving of notice as to whether the proposed development will go ahead. \n As a transitional arrangement, the new procedure will not apply where notice of the proposal has been given to the elected members in accordance with the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955 before 15 June next,  and \nwhere the works are being carried out by the local authority itself, they are commenced before 31 December next,  or  if the works are being carried out by contract, the contract is signed before 31 December next. \n  Provisions applicable to certain development by Government Departments and Office of Public Works  \n As and from 15 June, when a transitional period of one year established by the 1993 Planning Act comes to an end, most development by Government Departments and the Office of Public Works will be subject to normal planning permission requirements. However, certain categories of development by these bodies will be excluded from those requirements, because their sensitivity in security terms would not permit them to be subjected to the detailed requirements of public availability of plans and particulars involved in the planning process. These excluded categories include: Garda stations and army barracks, and other premises and installations used by the Garda&/i and the Defence Forces, prisons, courthouses buildings and other premises used in connection with the functions of the President, D&/ail &/Eireann, Seanad &/Eireann, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Office of the T&/anaiste, the Departments of Defence, Foreign Affairs, and Justice and the Offices of the Attorney General, the Chief State Solicitor and the Director of Public Prosecutions, security works at other State buildings or premises, or at the residences of public officials and office holders. \n Much of the development mentioned above will be subject to alternative requirements of public notice and consultation, which will involve: the giving by the State authority concerned of public notice of the proposed development, giving of notice of the proposed development to the relevant planning authority,\npublic availability of outline plans and particulars, and an opportunity to make submissions to the State authority, an express legal duty for the State authority to have regard to submissions received, and giving of notice of the decision of the State authority in relation to the proposed development. \n Arterial drainage works by the Office of Public Works will not be subject to planning permission requirements, because they are already subject to a statutory authorisation procedure involving public notice and participation. \n  Section 89 licences  \n A licence under section 89 of the 1963 Planning Act will be required to place chairs and tables on the public footpath outside a hotel, restaurant or public house. The fee for this licence will be <*> pound sign </*> 40 a year. \n\n\n  DUBLIN PORT TUNNEL SCHEME DEVELOPMENT  \n    EARLY HISTORY    \n Proposals for major roads to relieve the City of traffic and improve access to the Port, have been presented in numerous studies over the last thirty years with recent attention commencing when a route for the Port Access and Eastern Relief Route, was shown diagrammatically in Dublin Corporation 's \"Traffic Study of Dublin Port and Custom House Docks Area\", dated October 1989. \n    PORT ACCESS AND EASTERN RELIEF ROUTE STUDY    \n In January 1991 a firm of consultants was appointed to carry our a study of routes linking the M1 Motorway on the north side of the city to Booterstown on the south side of the city. Six routes were examined in the northern section of the PAERR report. These were known as routes A1, A2, A3, A4, A5 and A6. Information on the routes is contained in the following pages of this handout. \n    NORTHERN PORT ACCESS ROUTE STUDY    \n On 10th November 1992, the Government decided not to proceed with the Port Access and Eastern Relief Route. However the need to provide Port access still existed, and the northern section of the PAERR between the M1 and the Port was carried forward for further study, and reported on in the Northern Port Access Route (NPAR) report. This report recommended the A6 Route. \n    DUBLIN TRANSPORTATION INITIATIVE STUDY    \n As part of the Dublin Transportation Initiative (DTI), proposals for a Port Access Route were again evaluated.

{"text": "<Port Tunnel variation>\n\n\n<$A>\n To: The Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, Alderman and Members of the Dublin City Council. \n Re: Proposed Variation of the Dublin City Development Plan, 1991 - Dublin Port Tunnel \n The Local Government (Planning <*> ampersand </*> Development) Act 1963 provides that it shall be the duty of a Planning Authority to take such steps as may be necessary for securing the objectives which are contained in the provisions of the Development Plan. \n The Dublin City Development Plan, made by the City Council on 19th December, 1991, contains the following statements which are of specific relevance to the Dublin Port Tunnel concept: \n Paragraph 2.2.11  \"There is a necessity to relieve the existing street network of the bad environmental effects from dock traffic. The economic life of the city suffers from the congestion of commercial transport. Better Port access is required. \n Residential amenity is seriously effected by the heavy volumes of through traffic from the M1/Airport Road using the streets of residential areas. \n The feasibility of constructing a major Port Access and Eastern Relief Route linking the Port to the national road network will be examined.\"  \n Paragraph 3.22.0  \"It is the policy of Dublin Corporation to assist in improving the efficiency of Dublin Port and to seek to improve access to the Port by transferring extraneous Port generated traffic from the City Streets onto suitable alternative relief routes.\"  \n Paragraph 3.22.1  \"It is realised the development of alternative routes for Port related traffic raises environmental difficulties but given the potential benefits for the Inner city such routes must be investigated further. The provision of such facilities will relieve the City Quays, existing community shopping areas and poor environmental conditions resulting from heavy Port traffic.\"  \n When the City Council made the City Development Plan on 19th December, 1991, it included the following paragraph (14.5.13) in relation to the then proposed Port Access and Eastern Relief Route:  \"The report of the Consultants on the feasibility and environmental impact of a Port Access and Eastern Relief Route will be considered by the Corporation with other relevant studies and initiatives in the transport area having regard to the policy statements in paragraphs 2.2.11, 3.22 and 3.23 of the Plan. Depending on the findings of the studies a proposal to vary the Development Plan will be considered, if appropriate, by the Corporation.\"  \n The Government decided in November 1992 not to proceed with the Eastern Relief Route element of the proposal, (i.e. the section between the North Port and Booterstown); the study was thus restricted to a feasibility study for the Northern Access Route to the Port. The Consultant 's report recommended the route now proposed. This recommendation was noted by An Coisde Cuspoiri Coiteann on 27th July, 1995 and by the City Council subsequently on 4th September, 1995. \n During the studies undertaken for the Port Access and Eastern Relief Route, six route options for the northern section, between the M1 and the Port, were considered. These involved \"cut and cover\" tunnels, bored tunnels and new surface routes. Most were rejected because of the adverse environmental effects and prohibitive costs involved. The route now proposed was preferred for environmental, engineering and economic reasons. \n The Route proposed has a total length of 4.6km., approximately 3.5km which will be in tunnel construction. The implementation of the project is to be accompanied by traffic management measures (including a truck management system) on the lines recommended in the Final Report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative. \n The Dublin City Planning Officer Mr. P.F.A. McDonnell, has certified that the principle of such a route would correspond with the 1991 Dublin City Development Plan policies set out in clauses 2.2.11, 3.22 and 3.22.1. A variation of the Development Plan is accordingly recommended. \n The National Roads Authority in its letter of 15th November 1995, when making a formal request to the Corporation to carry out the scheme, stated that it is now Government policy that the scheme should proceed on a priority basis, as an element in the Final Report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative. The Corporation has engaged, as Consultants for the scheme, the firm of Geoconsult-Arup J.V. \n   DUBLIN TRANSPORTATION INITIATIVE   \n The D.T.I. Report, having examined a number of options, recommended that a tunnel from the Airport Motorway (north of Collins Avenue) to the Northern Port should be built. D.T.I. also recommended that its use by cars should be tolled, as a traffic management measure, to ensure that it would have the capacity to carry out its key function, which is access to Dublin Port for heavy goods vehicles. \n The current proposal is one of a number of key elements of the integrated DTI Strategy which are: greater priority to public transport services; new light rail transport routes and Quality Bus Corridors (QBCs) into the City and upgrading of DART; major road infrastructure, including completion of the C-Ring and the national road network outside the C-Ring; traffic management proposals, such as traffic calming and restriction of HGVs from the unsuitable streets and residential areas; construction of a tunnel, the North Port Access Route (NPAR), re-named the Dublin Port Tunnel, to link the North Port to the M1; land use policy. \n Implementation of this scheme and other elements of the DTI Strategy must take place as an integrated process in order to bring essential economic and environmental benefits to the City. As an integral part of the DTI Strategy, the proposed scheme seeks to relieve congestion on the City 's streets, assist in enhancing public transport provision and improve environmental quality in the City. \n   PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT   \n There has been extensive contact with the public in connection with this scheme, including public exhibitions in Whitehall, Fairview and East Wall. A permanent exhibition continues in the Civic Offices and the Consultative Group set up in response to the motion adopted by the City Council in March 1996 continues its programme of regular meetings. At the end of September, a total of eleven meetings had been held, involving residents ' groups, elected representatives, representatives from the Consultants <*> ampersand </*> Corporation officials. \n The concerns expressed by the residents at these meetings are being examined in detail and measures to alleviate these are being considered. I have every confidence that these genuinely-held concerns, with particular regard to air quality and tunnelling effects, can be addressed satisfactorily. \n  LEGAL PROCEDURES  \n Under the Roads Acts 1993, a motorway development shall not be carried out unless, following the holding of public local inquiry, the Minister has approved or approved with modification a motorway scheme submitted by a Roads Authority. \n  (i) Environmental Impact Assessment  \n The Roads Act obliges a local authority in applying to the Minister for approval for a motorway development to prepare and submit an Environmental Impact Statement to the Minister in respect of the proposed development. The Minister may then require the road authority to furnish him with specified additional information in relation to the likely affects on the environment of the proposal. \n  (ii) Motorway Scheme  \n Before submitting a motorway scheme to the Minister, the Roads Authority is obliged to publish a notice stating (a) that a scheme has been made, (b) is available for inspection, and (c) that objections may be made in writing to the Minister before a specified date. \n The scheme is required to be in a prescribed form and shall specify, (inter alia), any land or rights proposed to be compulsorily acquired or extinguished, planning permissions to be revoked, and these shall be described by reference to a map or maps (where appropriate). \n Before approving a proposed road development, the Minister shall consider\n(a) the Environmental Impact Statement submitted, (b) any additional information furnished to him, (c) any submissions arising from the EIS procedure, made in relation to the likely affects on the environment of the proposed road development,  together with,  the report and any recommendation of the person conducting the public inquiry into the proposal, where evidence is heard at such an inquiry in relation to the likely affects on the environment of the proposed road development. \n  (iii) Development Plan Variation  \n In addition to the public participation provided for by statute, by way of both the Environmental Impact Assessment and the Public Inquiry processes, to initiate a draft variation of the Development Plan for the Port Tunnel proposal would afford the public a further opportunity of participating in the process, by making submissions or objections, during the period of not less than three months, during which the proposed Variation of the Development Plan would be on public display. \n   VARIATION OF THE DEVELOPMENT PLAN   \n The City Council at its March 1996 meeting resolved to defer consideration of the variation process until the publication of the Environmental Impact Statement. \n The Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was published on July 5th and has been on public display since then. The full text of the EIS has been circulated to all public representatives and to 42 residents associations in the areas affected by the proposal. \n The City Council at its adjourned Quarterly meeting on 8th July, 1996, resolved to defer consideration of the initiation of the variation process until its October meeting. \n It is now desirable that the questions which have been raised at the Consultative Group level should be presented to a wider forum, and that the general public be allowed to examine and comment on the proposals, in accordance with a statutory procedure, with the objective of establishing the net environmental and economic position for the City, should the project be implemented. \n It is therefore recommended that the legal process be initiated for a Variation to the Dublin City Development Plan 1991 [as envisaged by the City Council when it included Paragraph 14.5.13 (see page 2) when making the Plan in December 1991] to provide for the construction of the Dublin Port Tunnel to link the M1 with a North Port Interchange. The proposed variation must go on public display for a period of not less than three (3) months. All objections and representations received in this period will be taken into consideration and a report will be issued to the City Council early in 1997. The City Council can then consider whether or not it is appropriate to vary the Dublin City Development Plan 1991. \n The following is a suggested text of a resolution for consideration should it be the will of the City Council to initiate the Variation Process:\n \"Dublin City Council hereby resolves to initiate the public display of a draft variation of the Dublin City Development Plan 1991, for the purpose of consulting the general public on the Dublin Port Tunnel motorway proposal.\"  \n J. Fitzgerald \n CITY MANAGER \n\n\n<$A>\n    DEFINITIONS OF SOME TECHNICAL TERMS ON THE FOLLOWING PAGES:    \n  SURFACE ROAD:    Where a road is constructed at or near ground level. \n  OPEN CUT:    Refers to the situation where the road is in a trench or cutting, at a lower level than the surrounding ground. \n  CUT AND COVER TUNNEL:    Cut and cover tunnels are constructed by excavating a trench from the surface downwards, constructing the floor, walls, and roof of the tunnel in the trench, and then filling the trench in again, and restoring the ground surface. \n  BORED TUNNEL:    Bored tunnels are constructed from beneath the ground surface, by excavating and removing the material to the shape of tunnel required, and supporting the surrounding ground. Different types and methods of tunnel excavation can be used. \n  GRADE SEPARATED JUNCTION:    This type of junction occurs when two roads at two different levels are connected. \n  ROUTE A1 \n  Route Description:   \n Route A1 would be in open cut at Whitehall and involve a new junction layout at Collins Avenue before continuing in open cut through the grounds of St. Mary 's convent, High Park and Highfield. Bored tunnelling would be used under Griffith Avenue continuing with 'cut and cover' tunnelling behind Rosmini and St. Joseph 's schools. Open cut would be used again through the grounds of St. Vincent 's Hospital to Richmond Avenue, with further sections of bored tunnel and 'cut and cover' tunnel under Richmond Avenue, Annesley Bridge Road, through Fairview Park and under the railway line. The route would then cross the Tolka Estuary on a bridge and continue as a surface road into the North Port.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "cd57d58f-1d2e-42ac-bfc7-4a362002e554", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.676138+00:00"}

I grew up at a time when the traditional main course was almost invariably sirloin steak. There may have been a prawn cocktail first, and probably a Black Forest gateau afterwards. But when you talked about an Ulster cuisine it was usually the old faithful, the Ulster Fry. \n How times have changed. Now we have chefs and restaurants worthy of the international reputations they are already establishing, and the influence of the leaders in the field is already spreading across the Province. Today there is a steady stream of wine makers from every major wine exporting country visiting Northern Ireland. And when they talk about their wines, they are usually fulsome in their praise for the accompanying fare. \n It was Hugh O'Neill, Chairman of the Tourist Board, who recognised the importance of promoting good Ulster products. And in 1990 he made the first moves to market his new idea. \n That was the beginning of 'A Taste of Ulster' and from the initial 27 members, the numbers of those participating has swelled to 100. \n Calor Gas was involved from the beginning, but now, in the third year of the scheme, has significantly increased its involvement. 'A Taste of Ulster' has a number of aims and objects, principal of which is the pursuit of excellence in the preparation and serving of food. And the best way of guaranteeing that excellence is by making use of the highest quality local produce. The range is enormous and not all of it is at the top of the food spectrum. It encourages initiative, enterprise and flair in producing dishes using local products to suit all pockets. \n And that is why the Taste of Ulster guide to the 100 recognised establishments includes coffee shops, pubs, cafes and restaurants both simple and sophisticated. \n The scheme operates under a management panel whose Chairman is Clare Connery. The panel includes Hugh O'Neill and representatives from the catering industry, and a team of inspectors covers the three main categories - hotels and restaurants, pubs and coffee shops. Those establishments which apply for membership will be inspected and, if they meet the required standards, accepted as members. \n The inspectors arrive without any identification and operate anonymously so that, hopefully, they are in the best position to judge the establishment from the point of view of members of the public. \n This year all 'Taste of Ulster' members events are being held in association with Calor Gas. Two major events have already taken place to raise the profile of 'A Taste of Ulster'. 'sourcing the Ulster Product' was the title of a forum held at Malone House in Belfast in January which brought Taste of Ulster members into contact with local Ulster Produce suppliers. Lord Arran, the Minister with responsibility for Agriculture, attended the forum and spoke positively about the benefits of strengthening the links between local suppliers and members of the catering industry. \n Taking part were exhibitors of meats, poultry products, seafood, dairy produce, organic foods, ice cream, bread, mineral waters and fruit and salads. Calor, as market leader in the liquid petroleum gas industry in the Province, and with over fifty years experience with the food and catering industry here, was also to the fore. Most chefs in the hotel and catering industry in Northern Ireland show a preference for cooking with Calor Gas. \n In March an important seminar examined ways and opportunities for members to publicise their establishments and professionalise their press relations. Two of the speakers, Chairman Clare Connery and Calor Gas Sales and Marketing Director Roy Connolly,    emphasised   the importance of striving for excellence in this area too. And in June a number of local chefs will be responding to the challenge of creating new Ulster dishes. \n The guide is laid out in an easy-to-read format with entries arranged county by county. Where possible, in addition to describing the nature of the establishment, fuller information is included which serves to give visitors a better picture of the individual character they can expect to find. The basalt hexagon which indicates membership is a guarantee of quality. \n As the level of tourism in the Province continues to climb, the importance of providing increasing numbers of visitors something unique, and to international standards, has never been greater. And as the general public here become more knowledgeable about food, and expect higher standards, then 'The Taste of Ulster' has a significant role to play to the benefit of all. \n\n\n<$C>\n  HOUSEHOLD BORES  \n  If ironing undies is high on your list of priorities, then  Lynda Gilby  thinks you should consider therapy. A paragon of idleness, she assures us that dust, if ignored, soon ceases to annoy. \n THERE SEEMS TO be a legion of women out there who are disappearing up their collective rectum with frightening efficiency, returning home each day from a full-time job but still shouldering the lion 's share of the household tasks. They may, perhaps, benefit from the experience of an incompetent like myself for it you are as haphazard around the home as I am, the only possible attitude to adopt to it is one of studied serenity. \n AND IF WE are ever to convert the male of our species to the concept of the New Man, then he will need to be confronted with the New Woman who does not dissolve into nervous collapse if the kettle handle isn't pointing due north. \n I SUPPOSE THAT quite a few people at some point in their lives, have a Road to Damascus experience. Mine came one evening as I was watching television. I 'd just finished excavating the grill pan, reflecting guiltily that I was the only woman I knew who never cleaned anything until it was truly dirty. \n  TOLERATING SQUALOR  \n I had, and still retain, a natural tolerance for squalor. Some days when I cast a cursory glance around my flat, I hardly knew where to begin. So I didn't. Once the dust was readily detectable, another week wasn't going to make much difference. \n SUDDENLY, MR QUENTIN CRISP intoned into my living room:  \"I have a message of hope for the house slave. After the first four years the dust doesn't get any worse.\"  I had been working along similar lines but I had never, until then, thought to boast about it. \n I STILL HAVEN'T the nerve to aspire to his blessed state of doing no housework at all but finally, I can timidly come out of my uncleaned closet to pass on a spot of accrued wisdom from the Gilby School of Household Management. \n THE BASIC MESSAGE is, I suppose: lower your standards. As Ms Nancy Spain once wrote:  \"Only a fool would clean under the bed.\"  \n I RECKON THERE are three bottom-line essentials for maintaining a healthy household: clean beds, clean food and a disinfected lavatory bowl. And any idiot can change the sheets, throw out leftovers before they grow whiskers and slosh a sash of Domestos round the loo in a matter of mere minutes. Everything else, particularly if faced with a partner not pulling his weight, is open to negotiation or neglect. \n I DON'T, BY the way, subscribe to the popular theory that who cleans the toilet is the acid test of whether or not there is a New Man in residence. From the way some pundits harp on about it you would think persons of the female gender were required to achieve the operation with their tongues rather than with a handy brush designed for the purpose. There 's no point making a fuss about something that demands so little in terms of time and energy. \n FAR MORE IMPORTANT is that dreadful marathon of drudgery know as  \"doing the ironing\" . I 'm told that the are born-again masochists who insist on ironing face flannels but I refuse to believe it. Writer Erin Prizzey maintains that if you stop ironing clothes, they soon cease to expect it and any residual creases fall out with the heat of your body. \n IF YOU SHARE premises, I suggest you issue a unilateral declaration that all household members over the age of ten are henceforth to do their own ironing. A ten-year old can be held legally responsible for murder, so smoothing his own football shirt shouldn't be beyond him. \n AND IF A MAN can fathom the functioning of the internal combustion engine, he ought to find mastering the intricacies of the steam iron as easy as falling off a feminist. Surly, morning cries of:  \"Where are my clean shirts/underpants/string vests?\"  should be met with a brisk but pleasant:  \"Beats the hell out of me.\"  \n IF YOUR NEAREST and dearest are unmannerly enough to leave a ring round the bathtub, ignore it. Take showers instead. Eventually the law of diminishing returns will prevail and before it gets to the hammer and chisel stage, someone else will become disgusted enough to clean it. \n  DEMANDING ROLLS  \n Must you always be the one who remembers to replenish the supply of toilet rolls? A few days of Belfast Telegraph applied abrasively to the affected part might concentrate the mind of your partner wonderfully. Self-interest is a great teacher. \n IT FOLLOWS, OF COURSE, that if you are to abrogate some of your onerous responsibilities, then you have to allow other people to do it their way. The fateful words of any woman are:  \"Get out of the way, I can do it quicker/better/properly/myself.\"  \n I USED TO OBSERVE with awestruck fascination, female friends who managed to keep dirt permanently at bay. They didn't so much live in their homes, rather, they appeared to be at war with them. Only a constant vigilance, it seemed, could maintain dominance over the grimy enemy within. \n SOME, NOW WORKING again since their kids are older, are coming round to my contention that windows need to be cleaned, at most, once a year. I work on the happy hypothesis that if I can't see out, nobody else can see in and that 's fine by me. Inside, hang heavily patterned nets and the dirt won't show.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "3cd84435-6cb0-40c6-91be-f792ddfc1f86", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.677058+00:00"}
{"text": "<Cookery matters>\n\n\n<$A>\n PIES WITH A PUNCH \n A notice in the butcher 's shop window announcing how many days until Christmas jolts the imagination and fills me with that feeling of pre-Christmas entertaining. So often the idea of a pie and a glass of punch party has immense appeal for those who like to entertain but want to keep it fairly casual and simple. \n I always prefer simple dishes to fussy ones and at this busy time of the year I turn my back on dishes with vigorous demands of split second timing. I have arrived at a selection of pies such as Snap Crackle Chicken; tender strips of chicken tossed in Parmesan cheese and served with slices of aubergine and a rich tomato sauce, or a Crustless Quiche which does not require making and rolling out pastry. Try the Bacon Muffins which go so well with a glass of Mulled Wine punch and create that instant cosy appeal by pulling up a chair and sitting down in front of a Calor gas living flame fire with instant heat and atmosphere at the press of a button. \n So many of these pies can be made in advance but I remember vividly one day was set aside as the main baking and cooking day. How easy life would have been with the Cannon Classique cooker with two large ovens ideal for the family who enjoys entertaining or have a lot to feed. \n Punch is always popular and the smell of Mulled Wine punch simmering on top of the hob is wonderful. Don't forget to offer the choice of    a   non-alcoholic drink for those who may prefer it. \n  Raised chicken and ham pie  \n  Hot Water Crust Pastry \n 170 ml/6fl oz water 115g/4 oz butter 115g/4 oz lard or unsaturated fat 450g/1 lb flour 1 egg yolk 1 tsp salt  \n  Filling  \n  450g/1 of cooked chicken pieces 225g/ 1/2 lb cooked ham 225g/ 1/2 lb mushrooms lightly cooked 1 dsp chopped parsley salt, pepper, pinch cayenne pepper  \n  To make the pastry  \n This quantity makes enough to line a 1.41 (2.5 pint) mould or 200mm (8 in) cake tin. \n Warm the mixing bowl and sieve the flour and salt into it. Make a well in the centre and hide the egg yolk in the flour. Heat the butter, lard and water in a saucepan, and when boiling make sure that the fat has melted before boiling point is reached. Pour into the flour and egg, mixing well with a spoon or knife. When the dough has cooled slightly turn onto a floured surface and knead until the pastry is smooth. It is a good idea to cover the pastry with cling film and leave it to rest at this stage for 15-20 minutes. Then use two-thirds to line the pie dish (keeping one-third for the topping) pressing firmly into the tin. \n Pack the cooked chicken, ham and mushrooms well into the tin, brush the top edge on the pastry with beaten egg, place the rolled-out third of pastry on top, and, using fingers, seal well on top. Decorate with pastry leaves, and make a hole to allow the steam to escape. Bake at gas 5 for 30-35 minutes. \n  Crustless Quiche  \n A very easy and quick dish which does not involve the making and rolling of pastry. A variety of fillings can be used. \n  170g/6ozs self-raising flour 55g/2ozs bran 6 eggs 1/4 teaspoonful salt 85g/3ozs unsaturated margarine 425 ml/ 3/4 pint of milk 1 large onion finely chopped 115g/4 ozs mushrooms 1 small tin salmon 225g/8ozs broccoli frozen Sprinkling of dill and freshly milled black pepper Grated cheese to flavour and garnish  \n Sieve the flour and salt into a large bowl, then rub in the margarine. Add the bran. Whisk the eggs, milk and cheese mixing well with the salmon and broccoli. The onion and mushrooms can be slightly cooked in the pan before also adding at this stage. \n Grease a quiche dish, then mixing well pour mixture into the dish and bake in the middle shelf of a preheated oven gas mark 5 for 30 minutes until golden brown and well risen. Cut and serve hot or cold with wedges of lemon. Good with tomato and basil salad. For extra flavour, try a sprinkling of dill and freshly milled black pepper. \n  Turkey and Almond Crumble with Crisp Celery  \n The secret of success with this dish is in the careful making of the buttery breadcrumbs. The addition of a crisp layer of celery gives this dish an element of surprise. \n  Crumble Topping  \n  8 slices white bread, crusts removed 55g/2oz butter 1/2 tsp salt 1/2 tsp ground mace 115g/4oz flaked almonds 1 head celery 3 tablespoons chopped parsley  \n  Sauce  \n  55g/2oz butter 55g/2oz plain white flour 850 ml/1.5 pints milk 1 chicken stock cube 55g/2oz grated cheese (Parmesan) 450g/1 lb turkey or chicken pieces 1/2 tsp mustard  \n Cut the turkey into bite sized pieces and arrange in a large fairly shallow ovenproof dish. Cooked turkey can be used for this dish but if using uncooked turkey or chicken lightly fry in a pan ensuring the flesh is well cooked and a light golden brown. \n Next make the sauce, melt the fat in a pan, add the flour and blend well with the milk and blended stock cube (dissolve in 2-3 tbsp boiling water) bring to the boil and simmer gently for 1-2 mins. Add the grated cheese and mustard then pour over the turkey pieces. \n Finally make the crumble topping. Melt the butter in a saucepan then add the salt, mace, breadcrumbs and almonds and cook for two mins until the crumbs become well coated and golden brown. \n Layer the celery over the turkey and sauce and then finally sprinkle the crumble topping over the celery. Bake in oven gas mark 5 for 25-30 mins. Serve piping hot garnished with freshly chopped parsley. \n  Bacon Muffins  \n These are delicious served warm with a glass of hot mulled wine. \n Makes about 14. \n Preparation time: 20-25 mins Cooking time: 35-40 mins Oven setting gas 5  85g/3 oz back bacon 340g/12oz self raising flour 2 tsp baking powder 1 tbsp chopped parsley 2 eggs, size 2, beaten 115g/4oz butter, melted and cooled 140ml/ 1/4 pint milk  \n 1. Cut the rind and excess fat off the bacon and finely chop the meat. 2. Sieve the flour and baking powder into a bowl. 3. Stir in the chopped parsley and lightly cooked bacon. 4. Pour in the beaten egg and melted butter. Beat well, adding enough milk to form a dropping consistency. 5. Spoon the mixture into 14 muffin tins or deep patty tins. Bake in a preheated oven for 20-25 mins gas 4. Serve warm. \n\n\n<$A>\n The Big Apple \n  There are few things to match the sweet flavour and crunch of home grown apples \u00d0 whether they be eaters or cookers. I like to use eaters in many desserts as they are less tart and more aromatic. However, they can be difficult to puree down so a good whizz in the processor may be needed. Apples combine so well with other savoury ingredients such as nuts, blackberries and elderberries for tarts, pies, puddings and crumbles or with plums, damsons, onions and tomatoes to create chutneys and relish which bring that wonderful aroma of autumn in the kitchen. To preserve the flavours of apples in liquid form try apple cordial \u00d0 not quite so potent as Joe Grundy from the Archer 's home brew. As well as for drinking it 's such a good choice to use when poaching apples and berries. Remember when buying apples, big does not always mean best and I find the medium sized ones have a better flavour. As a rule, three apples should weigh about a pound. If you can't keep up with the abundance of fruit in late autumn then apples freeze extremely well for up to six months. Peel, core and slice them thickly, blanch in boiling water for just 1 minute. Drain, then plunge into cold water and pack either in rigid containers or polythene bags, dusted with a little sugar. Making chutney is easier than jam making, but the secret lies in long steady cooking which should never be over-boiled. Cooking with CALOR GAS gives a good steady flame which is rapid and easy to regulate to ensure this even cooking. Chutneys improve greatly with maturity, so store at least one month before using. Enjoy the fruits of this wonderful season and remember, an apple a day keeps the doctor away as effectively in apple cordial, chutney or even baked apple sponge! \n  Please turn page for more recipes  \n  Apple cordial  \n This mildly flavoured cordial can be stored in screw top bottlers and diluted. I find it invaluable to add a concentrated apple flavour if roasting pork or duck. \n 35kg/31b apples juice of one lemon 285/10 oz granulated sugar 1/2 tsp citric acid 570ml/1 pint water \n Choose those firm rosy apples if you can for this cordial \u00d0 they will give it a much nicer flavour and colour. Wash and dry the apples, then chop up, but be careful to remove any blemishes which may be found on overripe apples. \n Place in a large bowl, cover with water and lemon juice and leave to soften, stirring occasionally. Cover and leave for 24 hours. \n Transfer to a heavy based pan and simmer until the fruit becomes soft. Transfer to a jelly bag or a sieve lined with muslin and strain. Do not speed up the process or the cordial will become cloudy. \n Return the strained juice to a saucepan, add the sugar and citric acid, and bring to almost boiling point and when the sugar has dissolved, leave to cool, then bottle. \n This cordial should store in the refrigerator for up to one week. \n  Blackberry and apple pie  \n Sweet Pastry: 285g/10 oz plain flour 55g/2oz caster sugar 200g/7 oz sunflower    margarine   or softened butter 1 egg yolk Filling: 450g/1 lb cooking apples, peeled, cored and thinly sliced 125g/4oz blackberries 55g/2oz demerara sugar 1/2 tsp cinnamon or cloves 2 dsp cider or apple juice or water to brush pastry one egg (Serves 8) \n To make the pastry sieve the flour into a bowl, add the softened fat, cut and rub through. Add the caster sugar and egg yolk to mix to a soft dough. Cover the pastry with cling film and leave to relax and firm up in the fridge for at least 1/2 hour. \n Put the apple juice, demerara sugar and spice into a saucepan and heat. Add the apples and cook for 1-2 minutes stirring to coat and soften the apples. Add the blackberries and leave to cool. \n NB If the berries are ripe and full of juice then the addition of 1/2 oz cornflour to the fruit will help to prevent the pastry becoming soggy during cooking. \n Roll out two thirds of the pastry and use to line an eight inch pie dish. Brush the base of the pastry with beaten egg to seal it during cooking. Add the apples and blackberries, draining off some of the juices. \n Roll out the remaining third of pastry into a circle eight inches in diameter. Brush the pastry edges with beaten egg, and place on the pastry top. Seal the edges together. \n Brush with beaten egg again and bake at 375F, 190C, gas mark 5 for 20-25 minutes until golden brown. \n Serve dusted with caster sugar. \n If liked the pastry for the top of this pie can be cut into narrow strips and latticed across the top. \n  Very Irish Potato Apple Cake  \n This is a very traditional Irish dish, and one I often make as a comforting snack. I like to serve this slightly buttered and dusted with caster sugar. The cake tastes even better if you warm them in the oven until the butter is melted. \n 225g/1/2 lb cooked potatoes 1/2 tsp salt 50g/2 oz flour 2 cooking apples peeled and finely diced 1 dsp lemon juice 30g/1 oz demerara sugar 1/2 tsp cinnamon butter and caster sugar to serve 30g/1 oz melted butter to spread on top \n Into a bowl place the chopped apple, cinnamon, demerara sugar and lemon juice. Cover and leave to sit, and prepare the potato cake. This dish is easier to make if the potatoes are still warm. \n Cook and finely mash the potatoes. Add the salt and pepper and gradually work in the flour until the dough becomes very pliable. On a floured board, roll out the dough 1/4 inch thick and cut into circles about 3 <*> inches sign </*> in diameter. \n Cover one round with the apple mixture, damp the edge and cover with the second piece. Seal the edges with a fork or pinching with your fingers. Cook on the griddle until golden brown. Alternatively this dish can also be cooked in the oven, gas mark 4/190C/375F for 20 minutes. \n  Braised Hot Pickled Red Cabbage with Apples  \n 1 medium red cabbage, shredded 350g/12 oz cooking apples, peeled and sliced 1 onion finely diced 115g/4 oz demerara sugar 570 ml/1 pint water or vegetable stock 1/4 pint red wine 2 dsp cider vinegar 1 dsp cooking oil 50g/2 oz raisins pinch salt and pepper \n In a large pan saute the onions in the oil, add the cabbage, apples, sugar, salt and pepper and toss. Next add the stock, red wine, cider vinegar and stir well. Place the lid on the pan and simmer gently for 60-80 minutes until tender. This dish can also be braised in the oven. Ten minutes before serving, add the raisins, allowing them to plump up nicely before serving hot. \n  Autumn Apple Chutney  \n This chutney brings the flavours of autumn together in a mouthwatering way. \n 450g/1 lb apples, cored and diced 225g/1/2 lb tomatoes chopped 450g/1 lb plums, stoned and diced 1 crushed clove of garlic 280ml/ 1/2 pint distilled vinegar 225g/ 1/2 lb demerara sugar 225g/ 1/2 lb golden sultanas 1 tsp each mixed spice and ginger \n Prepare the fruits and place in an aluminium pan with all ingredients except the sugar. Simmer gently for 10 minutes, then reduce the temperature and add the sugar, stir until the sugar has dissolved, then simmer gently until the chutney shows signs of thickening. Cool, then pack into clear, sterile jars. Makes approx 4 lbs. \n  Baked Apple Pudding  \n One of my favourite autumn puddings, which combines the flavour of old-fashioned, simply baked apples with toasted almond sponge. \n Vanilla sauce makes a lovely accompaniment. \n 115g/4 oz butter or margarine 115g/4 oz soft brown sugar 3 eggs, lightly beaten 115b/4 oz self-raising flour 85g/3 oz lightly toasted ground almonds 8-10 whole cloves 4-6 small rosy eating apples rind of one lemon \n To make the cake mixture, cream the fat and sugar until soft and fluffy. Whisk the eggs into the butter and sugar lightly but thoroughly, a little at a time. \n Whisk in the grated lemon rind and mix in the toasted ground almonds, cloves and self-raising flour. \n Transfer to a lightly greased serving dish and arrange the apples in the sponge mixture, then bake at 180C/350F Gas Mark 4 for 25-30 mins until cooked. Serve hot with vanilla sauce. \n  Vanilla Sauce  \n 1 vanilla pod or few drops of vanilla extract 30g/1 oz caster sugar 4 egg yolks 570ml/1 pint milk \n Place the vanilla pod with the sugar and leave the flavour to impart (at least 30 mins). As an alternative, a few drops of vanilla extract can be added to the sugar and left for the same length of time. Beat the eggs and sugar together until smooth and creamy. Warm the milk in a saucepan and pour over the eggs. Mix well and return to the saucepan. \n Over a very gentle heat stir until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. It is important to keep the temperature low during the making of this sauce, otherwise it will curdle. Serve warm.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "b9094d13-0f47-4c1b-8adf-f27f6d755aff", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.678578+00:00"}
{"text": "<Flowers - Colours>\n\n\n<$A>\n Forever Flowers \n By Maeve Watt \n  Frances Brown from Newtownards has always loved flowers and she started flower arranging ten years ago, beginning with leisure classes and was then encouraged to do her City and Guilds part 1 and 2. She enjoyed it so much that she decided to teach, got her qualifications and at the moment is teaching in Bangor Tech.  \n \"I REALLY LOVE TEACHING, SEEING OTHER    people 's   work. I am learning all the time too.\" She also loves competitive work where there 's a show and the entrants are given a title. \"You have to interpret the title in flowers and my most recent piece, The Flower Fairies, won up in Antrim. I had to compete again in England and won - the prize was a nice weekend in Glasgow which was great, except that it rained constantly!\" \n Frances also competed in the World Show where she was runner up and won <*> pound sign </*> 500 towards going to South Africa to represent Northern Ireland. \"I was absolutely thrilled. It 's in February and I have to do an exhibit connected with Northern Ireland. I 'm working on it at the moment,\" she laughs. \"But it 's a secret! There 's a World Show every four years, the last one was in New Zealand and the next one is in Edinburgh, so Frances is delighted to be going to South Africa! \"It 'll be a wee bit nerve wracking getting everything over there. If you take anything from here, there are pest controlled regulations and even material has to have a fire proof certificate. Obviously, as I will be depicting something from Northern Ireland, I 'll have to take some stuff over, but you can order flowers there and I 'm busy working the whole thing out at the moment. The plane will be filled with flowers!\" We wish her luck! \n Over the years, everything grown in her garden has been converted for flower arranging. If I 'm doing a wedding, it 's great to be able to go and cut stuff from the garden, nice and fresh, it also keeps the cost down a little,\" smiles Frances. And there 's a lot to learn in flower arranging, it moves on from fashion to fashion and Frances has to make sure that she keeps abreast of the new trends - including dried flower arrangements. \n \"There are different ways of drying and preserving flowers too - you can   get   glycerine leaves and silicone gel flowers and, of course, some flowers dry naturally.\" Her favourite flower is probably the rose because it can be dried as well. They must be picked just before full bloom on a nice dry day and hung upside down in a dark, warm place for about a fortnight. Red and yellow roses are the best colours to dry. Frances has a tip for beginners. \"The best thing to do is to try to compete, starting off in the novice section. The best way to learn is on the show bench where you will get comments from judges and also see other    people 's   work. \"It 's so enjoyable,\" she laughs, \"You may not always win, but at least if you make a mistake, you 'll know the next time! Frances Brown believes that a bowl of flowers brings a room completely to life and that a room without flowers or plants, is dead. \n With Christmas dinner parties starting to fill up the calendar, Frances has put together a step-by-step guide to creating three very different flower arrangements, guaranteed to brighten up any table setting. \n FLOWERS AND FRUIT \n THE PLASTIC DISH containing a soaked oasis which has been taped down and is sitting in the middle of a vine ring. Just to keep the furniture dry, the ring is lying on a base of cork (1). \n Frances puts a candle in the centre and round the bottom, she has taped on some kebab sticks so that they will go into the oasis and keep the candle in place. \n She is going to use apples, grapes, cones, a pretty tartan ribbon and some little bundles of twigs, some spray carnations and foliage - not anything with a soft leaf that would have to be replaced in the warmth, but ivy and holly which will last a long time. Spray carnations will last longer than most flowers over the Christmas period. \n The ribbon has wired edges to it which makes it sit up nicely and Frances just loops it four times, backwards and forwards before putting a wire tightly round the centre, making sure the wire is extended so that it can go into the oasis. She cuts the end of the ribbon in a vee shape to make it more attractive. \n Secure the apples with kebab sticks into the stem end which will help it sit in the oasis. Put in the candle and the outline of the foliage making sure that the foliage is dipping down because it has to cover the oasis. Put in the apples and grapes which have been wired, on opposite sides and remember to clean the stems of the foliage before use (2). \n Frances uses different foliage including Skimmia, turning the arrangement round all the time to make sure the oasis is hidden. \n She places the flowers, layering them so that there is a pocket of flowers on the opposite sides of the fruit to balance the colour (3). \n Cones are added to finish it off and little pieces of foliage, berries and small bundles of sticks to make it more interesting (4). \n Always make sure there is enough water in the dish to soak into the oasis and spray the arrangement daily to keep it fresh and alive. \n RING OF ROSES \n USING AN OASIS RING which has been soaked in a basin of water (turn the ring upside down and let it soak until the bubbles stop coming out) Frances sets it on a brass tray so that when she waters it, the water doesn't escape onto the top of the table (1). \n She uses gold coloured slimline candles in three different placements with a ribbon (wire edged again) at the base of each one. She also uses artificial gold balls, again in three different placements (2). \n The candles are placed at different levels and the flowers used are rich red roses. Covering the oasis in conifer, turning it round all the time and also placing the foliage on the inside of the ring and on the top so that it is entirely covered (3). \n She also uses variegated holly - the lime green colour goes well in arrangements as it lifts the colour. Frances picks all the foliage apart from the Skimmia, from her own garden. \n She adds some red berries and some red roses to distribute the colours throughout the design (4). (If the roses flop, you can recut them and place the ends in boiling water for half a minute and then float them in a basin of water. They should perk up again!) \n Frances finishes this arrangement by adding ivy leaves which have nice shiny surfaces to cover the oasis. \n GLAMOROUS GOLD \n PUTTING THE SOAKED OASIS into a container that has a spike in the end of it like a candle holder, push it down into the top of a glass container with a piece of gold lame material to wind round it (1). This arrangement is really for a buffet table. \n Frances is going to use white silk poinsettias trimmed with gold and some golden fruit, apples and pears, white September flowers to do the outline and a gold rope with tassels. She drops the material round the glass, tucking it in at the bottom. Frances likes using candles in table arrangements because they 're pretty to look at when eating and for this arrangement, she has used the slimline candles. \n She does the outline with the September flower and some lovely trailing ivy with a few variegated leaves towards the centre. The rope is then dropped down the glass over the material (2) and a cherub is added. His wings have been wired so he can rest in the middle of the arrangement. \n Frances fills in the design with poinsettias and foliage - you can bend silk flowers which makes them easier to use. She adds some gilded fruit (3). This arrangement, whilst looking extremely elegant, is reasonably easy to assemble. \n\n\n<$A>\n Colour Perfect Maeve Watt \n  Colour has a powerful    effect   on our lives and about 60 years ago, it was discovered that the colours we wear have a real influence on the appearance of our complexion. Now known as Personal Colour Analysis, this service is available throughout the world to men and women who care about projecting a positive image, who care about getting it right.  \n THE COLOUR CLASSIFICATION is based on the four seasons - Spring, Summer Autumn and Winter. The Spring person needs to use bright, vibrant, clear colours from light to bright and a Summer person needs soft, muted colours (that doesn't discount darker colours as the range includes soft dark colours that must be toned down or lightened). The Winter person suits very strong, acidy and sharply contrasting colours and the Autumn person suits the deep, earthy tones in the muted, soft end of the range - not just olive, brown and rust, but purples and any golden tones. \n During a colour consultation, the consultant looks at personality, colour preferences, the pattern in the iris of the eye, the effects of testers on the skin and does a detailed draping with a whole range of colours under special lighting conditions. The client is given a wallet containing her range of colours, 36 in all, which represent thousands of shades and advised to wear darker or lighter. \n Colour consultant Evelyn Burns was running a nearly new designer shop when she started to notice that an increasing number of brand new outfits were coming in. \"People had made mistakes and chosen the wrong colour. When they told me they had had their colours done, I remember thinking - my goodness, imagine letting someone tell you what colour to wear! I was so sceptical,\" she laughs. \"But as I watched these women transforming themselves, I thought I might be able to help women to select on the basis of their natural colouring. Then during a trip to London, I had my own colours done and it turned out that I was getting my own clothes wrong! Then I could see, wearing the new colours and make-up, how different I looked and how much better!\" \n Two years later, Evelyn trained with a Californian company in London and four years ago, set up her offices in the heart of Belfast. She also trains throughout Ireland and has 36 consultants, including one in Australia! \nAnd most women do get it wrong. Studies have shown that over 50 <*> per cent sign </*> have the wrong colour of clothes in their wardrobe. \"The problem is that most people are drawn to two totally different spectrums of colour. That is affected by the person 's taste and personality and what she 's attracted to, so that 's not something I eliminate, just something I have to work with and have to learn to recognise through the procedures in the consultation.\" \n Evelyn also knows that people have moods in colours that attract them more to one than another, from one year to the next, from one season to the next, and that they 're also influenced by what 's going on in the fashion world. \"Grey is being plugged this year and so many people who have never thought about grey will be wearing it, whether it suits them or not.\" \n Once Evelyn has established the two colours that the client is drawn to, she does a skin tone test where she finds out if the skin tone is cool or warm, followed by an eye pattern test. The iris diagnosis is based on the alternative therapy, Iridology which is a very important tool for working out someone 's colour. \"About 25 years ago, a connection was discovered between colour analysis and Iridology - they discovered that genetically, people with certain shapes in their eyes had certain personalities.\" The Autumn person often has a star shape around the pupil and the Winter person has a black spoke or stripe in the eye. The summer person has a 'cracked glass' pattern in the eyes and the Spring person has a golden sunburst. \"My eyes are actually blue,\" smiles Evelyn, \"But because I'm spring and have a golden sunburst, they look green! And no, I don't ever wear green eye shadow!\" Wearing matching eye shadow does little to enhance the skin. Many Winters who have olive coloured eyes, don't suit olive, they're better wearing emerald. Many brown eyed women wear brown eye shadow which does nothing for them, they should be wearing greys or mauve tones which will have a clarifying effect on their skin. \n Evelyn advises the client on all aspects of make-up, doing their faces so they can see for themselves. She also gives advice on the kind of jewellery the client should wear and even the size and colour of glasses that will suit her best. Most women, alas, do seem to get it wrong! \n Evelyn drapes her clients in silk scarves with a range of colours, working through the reds and yellows, greens and browns, pinks and blues in a particular order, leading them to the point where they can see for themselves what suits them and what doesn't. \"It usually takes about 6 drapes which just cover the shoulders and reflect onto the face, but once they can see, they 're delighted!\" Some people respond very dramatically at times, sometimes chatty people are deep in thought at the end of the consultation, but everyone plans to start wearing their new colours. \n Winters get it right better than anybody else because, by personality and genetically, they 're set up with real flair and man of them are involved in fashion design. \"There 's a whole connection between the seasons and the occupations they 're involved with,\" says Evelyn. \"Winters are also compassionate and are often in the medical profession. So, a profession is often a clue to a consultant.\" Superficial colouring, of course, is not and all the seasons have an equal mixture of colours - you can have a blonde, blue eyed Winder, Spring, Summer of Autumn. Many Autumns are in teaching or training and involved with the organisation of people. They have powerful perseverance and, along with Winters, are often powerful leaders. Springs are the communicators and like selling, they 're good at PR and can do small talk spontaneously. Diversity in their job is a necessity. Summers are the gentle people in life - they 're very methodical and precision orientated and do the support role, brilliantly. \"I am spring,\" says Evelyn. \"But remember the idea of two sides to everybody and that they 're drawn to two different types of colour - I 'm a Spring with Summer secondary, like the active and the passive. Spring, yes, I want to be out there with other people and Summer, the reserved, where I 'm quite happy on my own! And precision orientated and pernickety!\" Evelyn is drawn to red and golds. \n Fragrances also connect with a person 's colouring. The Spring person suits light floral or fresh fragrances like    L'Air du Temps, Colours by Benetton and the Autumn woman needs something a little more musky, like Opium, Eternity, Poison. Winters suit spicy perfumes - Paloma Picasso, Safari and the Summers suit the lightest scents like Rive Gauche and    Chanel   No. 5. \"Different fragrances smell different on different people,\" says Evelyn. \"It 's because of the undertone, the chemistry of the skin.\" \n Your colour is genetically set up, like your finger prints and eye pattern. If people learn about the particular shades of colour that suits them, in clothes, in make-up, in hair colour, they will be totally harmonious and perfectly groomed. \"This is not about looking beautiful in ideal terms,\" says Evelyn. \"It 's about looking perfect for them and nothing beats the balance of colour. It presents them in their best light and gives them an aura of good judgement and harmony. Once you discover what suits you, people start saying how well you look and it 's a real confidence booster,\" laughs Evelyn. \"And let 's face it, we could certainly all do with a daily does of that!\"", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d565f2ce-2f1b-4f80-b464-e1c199e68f26", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.679759+00:00"}
{"text": "<Bowling matters>\n\n\n<$A>\n Corky 's Column \n Irish international and tv-commentator, David Corkill, has joined Today 's Bowler to pass on his many experiences and give his views on the game and how he sees it developing. \n SCOTLAND WITHOUT! \n The Home International Series took place in my home town of Belfast with arguably the best team (they were after all the holders) not involved. \n Last month former Scottish international Gary Hood gave his views on the decision of his country to pull out of the event and many others have also passed comment. \n I personally believe that it was a decision taken in haste. \n The reason given was that the financial contribution by Scotland was too high, maybe so. The figure of 35p levied on all bowlers is on top of the <*> pound sign </*> 10,000 each country pays towards the Championship/Series. Scotland 's contribution was therefore <*> pound sign </*> 33,000 which on the face of it, accepting that England pay a lot more, is substantial. \n The issue for me though is not the cost of money terms it is more about the repercussions for the bowlers of Scotland. \n The losers in the withdrawal were definitely the bowlers. \n Players in the outdoor game compete in many different competitions but for most it is the National Championships that are of the greatest importance. \n This is for two reasons. \n Firstly, to enable an uncapped player to come to the attention of the national selectors, thus giving them a chance to be selected for the trials (or equivalent) and subsequently for the national team and secondly, to compete in the British Isles Championships. \n The decision to pull out of the BIBC Championships in Belfast has made both these objectives obsolete. Unless Scotland decide to go back into the fray next year at Worthing, then the Scottish trials or their equivalent, will be unnecessary. \n Most competitive bowlers harbour an ambition to represent their country. The Scots are renowned for being fiercely patriotic, which is a definite strength, but they are also one of the best bowling nations in the world. The ordinary punters trying to break into that level of bowls can, for the time being, pack their bags. Without a full international team, where can they go if they aspire to wear the coveted international blazer? \n This will also impact on the teams selected for Commonwealth Games and World Championships. \n Of course, a small squad of players have been selected and representatives are to be chosen from the chosen few. How    elitist   is that option when you have no way to prove your worth at international level? \n The current Scottish National title-holders who were due to come to Belfast will now not get the chance and according to all reports were not asked their opinions before they were forced to withdraw. \n The issue surrounding the players who qualified for the British Isles Championships is, I believe, a different case in some respects to the international team-members. \n They are not subject to the vagaries of selection as they have earned their right to compete by winning the respective national championships. That gave them the right to come to Belfast. \n Could they have done so without the backing of the Scottish Bowling Association (SBA)? \n Not being a lawyer, I have no idea but are we straying into the area of legal argument? Could the BIBC give them permission to compete? The answer appears to have been NO. But is this a legally correct decision? I 'm not sure as to the constitution of the BIBC but I hope someone has read it very carefully and taken legal advice before issuing the decision. \n High Court action relating to bowls is not uncommon. You only have to look back at the fiasco the Irish Bowls Association were involved in when they challenged a player 's right to use coloured bowls in the early stages of a national competition. \n I have been asked about aggression shown on the green - was it intimidation or natural    exuberance  ? I replied that I felt so long as no code-of-conduct on player 's behaviour or the unwritten rules of sportsmanship were broken it was a behaviour pattern to be encouraged. Noise will never replace skill but there is no harm in unsettling opponents and lifting your own side. \n Next month I 'll give an update on the more interesting points of the International Series. \n\n\n<$B>\n The Umpire - BRYAN DALY \n A Bowls magazine wouldn't be complete without a column on umpiring. This is where I make my entrance. \n At the recent World Indoor Bowls Council championships in Belfast where I was performing as Chief Umpire I had a lengthy conversation with Mr John Graham, editor of Bowls 2Day. I enjoy reading and in particular anything to do with Bowls and sport in general. After some bargaining I eventually bought one of his magazines, and before you say any more, Yes, I still had to pay the full price. Still it was worth a try. \n I thoroughly enjoyed reading this bright new publication. I am glad to see that it covers all bowls in the province and definitely adds the touch of having that local interest. It certainly has something for everyone. \n The championships held in Belfast in April certainly had a different look about it. We incorporated some of the features introduced by the World Bowls Tour in Blackpool last year and Potters this year. Such changes as, No dead ends, best of 2 sets (7 ends / 9 ends), 3m T and match tiebreaks certainly caught everyone 's attention. \n Overall the event went extremely well attracting some of the best bowlers in the world. Having this attraction the large crowds were very well entertained. It was certainly a learning experience for most people coping with the rule changes. It put a lot of pressure on the umpires who were interested in not only keeping themselves right but also the players. I would like to take this opportunity in congratulating the Umpires for all their help before and during the event. Every single one of them are true professionals of their sport and should be proud of the fantastic work they did for me. \n As already mentioned we had some very exciting matches and thankfully most went off trouble free. The only major problem I had was during one of the ladies singles round robin matches. One player was leading by 5 shots after 6 ends of a 7 end set. The player leading wanted to play the last end. On questioning the lady I ascertained that although she was leading and could not    lose   the set she wanted to play the last end to try and increase her score (bearing in mind that in the round robin stages shots scored could decide who would qualify for the quarter finals if the match wins were equal). I accepted she had an argument but the rules clearly states that the set or match is over when at any stage it becomes impossible for your opponent to win. She accepted this and the game continued. \n While I am on the rules of the game, I would take this opportunity in asking you to send your questions, queries and suggestions to me via 'Bowls 2 Day' and I will do my best to consider and answer your points. I would like to kick this off by asking you to send me your views on what the outcome would be in the problems faced in the last issue with Cyril 's bowls in 'The Archers'. \n I will also share with you in the next issues, my experiences and views on, Local, National, International and World Bowls in Short mat, Indoor and Outdoor. \n So GET WRITING NOW! \n\n\n<$C>\n BE BOWLED OVER BY DENNIS \n For anyone responsible for looking after bowling greens, a special seminar being organised by Dennis, the renowned manufacturer of mowers and turf care equipment, will be an absolute must. \n Taking place on Wednesday 31st July 2002 at Greenmount College of Agriculture <*> ampersand </*> Horticulture, Antrim from 9.15am-4.00pm, one of the seminar highlights will be an overview of Bowling Green Maintenance from Dave Bracey, a Head Groundsman and adviser to the Institute of Groundmanship, the English Bowling Association, and the BCGBA. \n Other speakers will cover important subjects such as Basic Machinery Maintenance, the Service and Backup available from Specialist Dealers, and topical issues including New Developments in Turfgrass Breeding. These will be backed up by full working demonstrations of the latest equipment and techniques, and a comprehensive Question and Answer Session. \n The event is targeted at professional and amateur greenkeepers in the public and private sectors, as well as contractors. \n Places are free, and refreshments and lunch are provided. Demand is expected to be high: a similar event held recently by Dennis in Yorkshire attracted 160 delegates. So book early to avoid disappointment. To secure your place, contact Julia Howard at Dennis on 01332 824777. \n\n\n<$C>\n DENNIS DEALER BOWLS THEM OVER IN NORTHERN IRELAND \n Dennis, the manufacturers of mowing and grounds care machinery, have appointed the Cyril Johnston company of Carryduff as its latest dealer for Northern Ireland. \n Cyril Johnston have extensive showroom facilities, and their team of dedicated sales executives promote, advise on and demonstrate a wide range of turf care equipment to their large client portfolio in both private and public sectors. They have selected the Dennis line-up, which includes trailed gang mowers, pedestrian mowers and modular turf care systems, to fill a specific niche, between domestic equipment on one hand, and large high work-rate machinery on the other, such as that used by golf courses and local authorities. \n \"Dennis equipment is absolutely ideal for grounds men at smaller sports clubs, and particularly for use on bowling greens,\" says the company 's David Johnston. \"Interest in bowls is currently very strong in Northern Ireland, and clubs are keen to promote the highest standards of turf quality. With purpose-built Dennis machinery, they can achieve perfect greens.\" \n The Dennis line-up includes the versatile FT range, which can be fitted with numerous 'cassettes' for a host of maintenance tasks including mowing, scarifying, brushing, verti-cutting and sweeping. The company 's pedestrian and towed mowers are renowned for their quality of finish, and Dennis can also supply powered barrows, anti-theft systems for turf products, and a range of hand tools. \n\n\n<$D>\n PROVINCIAL TOWNS INDOOR BOWLING CLUB \n The Annual Dinner and Presentation of Trophies was held on Friday last, when members and their guests    were   welcomed by the Club 's Honorary Secretary Mr. Joe Boyd, who said how nice it was to see so many present and he wished all an enjoyable evening. \n After all had enjoyed a beautiful meal prepared and served by Mrs. Ruby Teacy and her helpers, the Club President Mr H. Sweeney in adding his welcome to all present thanked the members for electing him as President. He had enjoyed his year very much and had many happy memories of it, especially when he welcomed the youth teams from all the home countries in January. This had been a very enjoyable weekend both on and off the green when we all watched some very good bowling by the young boys. Our indoor season is now finished, and went so quickly since play began in October. \n Our Club is very fortunate in having Joe Boyd as Hon. Secretary and Tommy Smith as Hon. Treasurer and on behalf of our Management Committee and all our members, I thank them both very much for all the work done in looking after the smooth running of our Club.

{"text": "<Homes and gardens>\n\n\n<$A>\n    Putting   a new light in your life \n  Nature is brilliant at varying the light with the seasons.  \n It varies from sombre, muted glows of winter, through the contrasting light-and-shades of summer to perhaps its most effective: the mellow, subtle levels of autumn. \n You can match the mood of the year just as easily in your home with careful and imaginative use of lighting. \n It is not widely realised that lighting effects can transform a house far more cheaply than a complete redecoration, say the Lighting Association. \n Lighting offers tremendous flexibility - no two evenings in your front room need present quite the same atmosphere. \n Spotlights, uplights, downlights, table lamps, pendants - there 's a vast number of ways to ring the changes. \n Every room in the house benefits from imaginative lighting - and low voltage halogen and compact fluorescent bulbs add to possible combinations. \n The living room has to perform a multi-function role, so versatile light sources are essential. Dimmer switches, too, are invaluable. \n Downlighters create shadowy areas which can make a room look more cosy and intimate. \n Subdued background illumination can also help protect against eye strain, which opticians warn can result from watching television in the dark. This can be achieved with \"wall-wash\" lighting. \n By contrast the kitchen should be shadow-free yet many suffer from having only a central light source. \n Good lighting can eradicate the dangers of working with sharp utensils in your own gloomy shadow. \n Bedrooms offer wide scope for discreet lighting effects, often with opportunities to create effective glows by reflecting light off large mirrors. Uplighters are also ideal for bouncing light off surfaces. \n\n\n<$B>\n A fitting change \n  FITTED bedrooms are on the increase in Northern Ireland homes, though they account so far for only a small proportion of the very large bedroom furniture market.  \n This is in sharp contrast to other countries on the continent such as France where up to 80 pc of homes have fitted bedroom furniture. \n Smaller \n This recent trend can be largely attributed, said a spokeswoman from Sliderobes, to the type of house being built today where rooms tend to be smaller and more awkwardly shaped. \n In these situations, fitted bedroom furniture triumphs over free standing as it 's custom-built, utilizing every available inch of space, from floor to ceiling and it can be made to fit any bedroom, no matter what its shape. \n Fitted wardrobes with sliding doors can offer a further advantage as unlike standard fitting which has hinged and bifold doors don't encroach at all, into any of the bedroom space. \n Where space is particularly limited sliding mirrored doors prove very popular as they automatically create an illusion of spaciousness in even the smallest of rooms. \n Mirrored doors have always been popular. However they are not to everyone 's tastes. \n As a result of demand, the variety of door styles has been expanded greatly to include a wide range of wood effect panels, some very beautiful wood veneers, wallpapered panels and for those who wish to achieve total co-ordination in their chosen decor - the fabric covered panel. \n Fitted bedroom furniture is particularly popular around the 35 years of age group. \n\n\n<$C>\n What to look for in a conservatory \n  NO matter what the reason for building one, there can be no doubt that the addition of a conservatory will increase the value of a home and provide a room with a difference.  \n It therefore pays to select carefully, warns Charlie Woods, manager of BDG Conservatories. \n It is also desirable that the sun should shine in the new room. However a south facing conservatory will become stiflingly hot if not properly ventilated. \n While high level opening windows are fine to air the room an opening roof vent is even more efficient. It is worth considering incorporating thermally controlled roof vents. \n No longer is the conservatory a room which is used only in summer and for that reason double glazing is generally standard nowadays. In particularly sunny locations, tinted glass may be desirable as it cuts down both glare and heat. \n Strong \n Glare can also be caused by very light coloured ceramic floor tiles and it is worth keeping this in mind when choosing from the wide range of floor coverings available. \n The most common materials used in the framework of a conservatory are aluminium, timber and PVCU. Each of these have their advantages and disadvantages. Aluminium provides a very strong structure but may not perform as well thermally as PVCU while wood requires more maintenance than either. \n Lighting can create atmosphere as well as fulfilling a practical purpose and in many dwellings the    fluorescent   strip has been replaced by more subtle means of ceiling and wall lighting. \n A ceiling fan can help ventilation but can also incorporate lighting and be decorative. \n\n\n<$D>\n A new outlook on life \n  ONE aspect of your home that influences your life is that of sunlight, another equally fundamental consideration is energy, writes Jonathan Cromie of Turkington Windows and Conservatories.  \n We instinctively know that sunlight is crucial to our mental and physical health, yet progress has resulted in our conducting more of our working time hidden away from the sun. Our optimum environment is daylight. \n A surprisingly large amount of heat too is provided by the ambient energy present in daylight. We should do well to consider that during daylight a glass wall will gain more heat    than   it loses, whereas a brick wall will only lose heat, especially when wet. \n Integral \n Conservatories therefore have become very popular additions to our homes for good reason, and, are now often integral parts of new dwellings. \n Up to 50,000 conservatories a year are being installed in Britain, and the number is rising. As a result of new technology and materials, today 's conservatory can be more economic than ever before. Reinforced PVCu has become the norm, with its low maintenance and high insulation properties. Double glazing, toughened, tinted, laminated or with low emmissivity coatings are even more practical. Roofs can be double glazed, or of polycarbonate, with its properties of great impact strength, increased insulation, lower deadweight, ultraviolet filtering and glare reduction without the need for internal roof blinds. \n Features of any conservatory depend on the demands and    constraints   imposed by your home. If you do not have doors from your house at a suitable position, which windows you open up into doorways; which position would give the best views? \n Symbol \n Orientate the site in a southerly aspect if possible for maximum solar gain, S.E. for morning sun, S.W. for a view west as the sun sets. Do you want your conservatory easily seen from the road as a status symbol, or is it to be a quiet retreat away from public view? \n Doors and windows of many kinds can be used, remember, heat build up in summer can be surprising and windows can be features as well as necessities. \n Solid floors store heat during the day and improve ambient temperature, remember, reflective or white tiles should be avoided as they dazzle under direct sunlight. \n\n\n<$E>\n Get your garden ready for spring \n  SEPTEMBER sees a change of emphasis in the garden, a change which gains impetus as the autumn advances, writes Craig Wallace.  \n During the summer months the emphasis is mainly on maintenance and the keeping up of appearances - the lawn, hedges, the roses, the general flower borders, hanging baskets, window boxes, container plants, the vegetable plot. \n With attention being paid to watering and feeding, a colourful flower display can be maintained to the end of September and beyond. \n Fillip \n And with such a sunless summer a fine \"back-end\" would be a real fillip. However, as the light evenings get shorter and the days draw-in, harvesting and planning ahead become increasingly important. \n Bulb planting now means a welcome display from February through to May next year. The bulbs have been in the nurseries and garden centres since the end of August. \n Choice \n Even if planting has to be spread out, purchases should be made as soon as possible. Otherwise as the bulbs get picked over, and the boxes emptied you might have to take the leavings and second choice. And it 's not unknown for bulbs to get mixed with all the handling and sorting, the longer they are on display. \n Daffodil planting comes first, repeat first. Expert growers make a point of getting in their daffs before the end of September, earlier if possible. Generally the taller and larger the daffodil variety, the bigger the bulb - dwarf and miniature types produce quite small bulbs. \n Virus \n I have seldom seen poor quality bulbs on offer from local garden centres or from the reputable bulb firms, but beware of the cheap mail-order bargains as they can prove to be very disappointing what with virus, eel-worm, narcissus-fly affecting the bulbs. \n Tulip planting can take the hindmost, even well into November, with all the others, the crocuses, snowdrops, irises, aconites, scillas, hyacinths, puschkinias, etc. coming in between. It 's all about looking forward and planning. \n Work on the lawn also has an element of looking ahead - for a better sward next spring and summer. Autumn lawn dressings tend to contain less nitrogen and greater proportions of potash and phosphate. \n Hence the immediate greening-up effect is less noticeable, compared to spring and summer lawn foods. On the other hand the slower acting ingredients work over the autumn and winter months so that the grasses get off to an early spring start. \n The manual tasks - scarifying, raking, aerating, spiking, top-dressing - all are aimed at long term improvements as well. \n Autumn is also a time for \"putting to bed\" the summer flowers - the gladioli, dahlias, begonias, the early chrysanthemums, fuchsias, geraniums. \n\n\n<$F>\n The colours of autumn \n  WHAT colours an designs are fashionable in the home this autumn? asks Mandy Tang of Donaldson and Lyttle.  \n Well, almost anything goes, it 's down to the individual 's personal taste, ranging from cool blues, greens and yellows to intense marigolds,    cobalt   blues and deep Indian red, even natural ivory with taupe, combined with texture all seem to be increasingly popular. \n Tones \n Therefore, earth tones are very much a favourite combining terracotta and golds with rich spice colours. A lot of these themes are inspired from Indian art, textiles and architecture. \n Traditional styles are being freely and imaginatively adapted to suit the modern home. However, man fabrics used in the later 17th century were made from luxury silks and heavy cotton velvets which have to be replaced with man-made fibre copies to create a similar effect. \n Many traditional fabrics were heavily patterned with deep floral prints and brocades which complemented the silk damask weaves used on upholstery. \n Many people today concentrate on what fabric they use on their suites and use that as a base to work around. \n They are initially looking for value for money, a hard wearing cover with serviceable colours. These can easily be found with the help of an interior design consultant who has the knowledge of what is widely available. \n\n\n<$G>\n Mediterranean style \n  WHEN it comes to the use of tiles in our homes, we fall well behind our style-conscious European partners, writes Frances Egan of Tile Market.  \n The French and Germans use around twice the number of tiles we do and the Italians around four times. However, in recent years the trend towards tiles here is rapidly growing and reflected in the styles, colours and sizes available. \n So why tiles? A look at the practical benefits will explain why there is an ever increasing popular choice. \n Firstly, they are easily cleaned and hygienic. They don't hold residues or dust and are largely unaffected by light. Another important features of ceramic tiles is their insulation capacity. They tend to retain heat generated inside a room, while on the other hand they will keep a room cool during hot weather. \n Traditionally tiles are used most in kitchens and bathrooms. However, trends in interior design and the move away from wall to wall carpeting means tiles are in vogue throughout the home. \n Tiles fall into two main categories - floor tiles and wall tiles, each of which are made to different specifications and are available in a wide range of materials. Therefore the importance of visiting a specialist, experienced tile supplier must be stressed if you are to find the right tile for your job and avoid the pitfalls. \n Floor tiles are available in a wide range of materials ranging from ceramics to marble, terracotta and slate. The choice of floor tile will depend on what type of effect is to be achieved. Terracotta and slate tiles give a warm rustic feel while ceramic tiles give a more modern look.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "0cf7a3cf-57ad-4b77-9f06-e55dbfe855f7", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.682321+00:00"}
{"text": "<Italian Spinone club>\n\n\n<$A>\n MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN: \n Well the shooting season is over and the show season is now upon us. I hope everyone will have an enjoyable year whether you are showing, training or just learning a little more about your Spinone. The Committee are at present working on a programme of events for 1995. We have had a very positive reaction to the idea of a Spinoni Weekend and we also have our Club Show in July. We hope as many people as possible will participate. Details will be forwarded to all members in due course. \n Many thanks to Ms. Linda Collins and Mr. Steve Kimberley for their articles for the Newsletter it is great to have such good input from our overseas members. Thanks must also to go Ciara for her poem and my other half for struggling to put the whole thing together. Typing is definitely not her greatest talent! Despite threatening divorce, coffee addiction, and an unbelieveable line in expletives she met the deadline. \n So please folks get on your thinking caps, put pen to paper and    let 's  < hear from you for our next Newsletter for the Club Show. I want to live a long and happy life!! \n Please note that any statements or opinions expressed in this Newsletter do not necessarily reflect the views of the Officers and/or the Committee of the Club. The Officers and Committee therefore do not accept responsibility for any comments, views or expressions contained in this publication. COLM TIMMINS \n\n\n<$B>\n Dear Members, Well    it 's   a bit rough and ready but I hope despite the obvious typographical errors you enjoy our first attempt at a Newsletter. Thank you to those who contributed and Colm for the layout and printing. I hope you will all seriously consider giving some input whether lighthearted or serious for the next edition which we hope to produce in time for the Club Show in July. \n If anyone has any problems or queries re the Breed please feel free to contact any of the Officers or Committee. We will all be happy to help you in any way we can. \n Many of you may not be aware that next year marks the tenth anniversary of the Irish Kennel Club 's recognition of the Italian Spinone. I hope we will be able to produce a concise history of the Breed in Ireland to mark the event. In the meantime perhaps a brief outline of the bloodlines in this country would be of interest. \n The first Spinone imported into Ireland from the U.K. was Stowlodge Sorrento born 29/12/'85, next was Stowlodge Serenata born 1/10/'86 and in 1988 Stowlodge Sirius born 18.1.'88. All were owned by Mr. Finn Cuthbert (Drackett). It was the two matings of Stowlodge Sirius and Stowlodge Serenata that produced the foundation stock for the Colheath and Sharpshot Spinoni along with the litter bred by Mr. J. Hawthorne in April '93. \n Until the three litters born in '94 (see review of '94) there have only been two matings that introduced new bloodlines into our stock in this country. The first mating was Drackett Anika ex Colourbox Hell Oh producing the first litter to the Colheath kennel in April '93. The second mating was Mr. J. Hawthorne 's Drackett Armedia exNantiderri Fit the Bill which was imported by Mr. John Wallace, producing a litter also in April '93. \n In the past nine years there have only been eight litters bred in Ireland so it would be fair to say that the breed is still in its infancy here. It is therefore up to us to ensure we maintain all the finer qualities of the breed as we head into the next decade. We should be proud that over 80 <*> per cent sign </*> of Italian Spinoni in Ireland are working gundogs and therefore truly fulfil the Dual Purpose qualities of the breed. HEATHER TIMMINS (Colheath) \n\n\n<$B>\n REVIEW OF THE YEAR 'S EVENTS DURING 1994 \n On February 20th '94 the inaugural meeting of the Italian Spinone Club of Ireland took place. The aims of the Club are to provide information, support and encourage comradeship for Spinone owners or those who hold an interest in the Breed. In October of '94 the Club became officially affiliated to the Irish Kennel Club Ltd. \n It really proved to be an excellent year for the Breed in Ireland. We were really pleased to welcome several new exhibitors from England and Scotland, we would like to congratulate one of those exhibitors in particular on her achievements. Mrs. Laurie Craig whose dog Wynsett Steady Under Fire at Baillieston was the top winning Spinone here for 1994 and achieved the title Annual Champion '94 under I.K.C. Rules. \n Mrs. Marie Fox from Cornwall also achieved top honours when her dog Colheath Noble Fir won Best of Breed at the first official Club Show. 'Flint' was also pulled in the final line up for Gundog Puppy at St. Patrick 's Day last year. \n However, the highlight of the year for me personally came in June when my bitch Drackett Athena bred by Mr. Finn Cuthbert became the first IR. SHOW CHAMPION SPINONE and truly earned her place in any history of the Breed here. \n We also look forward to seeing a new generation of Spinoni in the field and show ring this year following the birth of three litters in 1994. The first in September to Mr. Peter Brannigan 's Beanie 's Belle ex Drackett Alban, the second in October to my own Sh. Ch. Drackett Athena ex An. Ch. Wynsett Steady Under Fire at Baillieaton and finally to mark a perfect end to the year a Christmas litter to Joyce Ruigrok <*> ampersand </*> Dan Delaney 's Inostricani Rossa ex their Drackett Alban. \n It must also be noted that this year perhaps more than any other there has been an incredible interest in the working abilities of the Spinone and full credit must be given to those owners who rough shoot with their dogs and promote the Breed through that    closeness   between handler and dog this does more to promote the abilities of the Spinone than any written word.\n HEATHER TIMMINS (Colheath) \n\n\n<$C>\n  INSIGHT INTO TRAINING THE ITALIAN SPINONE  \n Dear Members, Well I have been scratching my head since being asked to write about the training of the Spinone, trying to find areas which would interest non-working owners. \n Firstly I will outline very briefly my involvement with gundogs. I started over 14 years ago training Springers having reasonable success in tests, then due to a change in my shooting I moved to Labs, once again having success in tests. I still run both breeds both for myself and handling dogs on occasions for other people I have trained dogs for friends and to date, not had any comebacks as to their performances. I moved to Spinones because I felt other breeds were being overbred and spoiled for monetary gains. \n I have   at   long last found a breed which is being cared for in the correct manner. It would be a shame to see this breed go the same way through lack of careful and select matings. We must all insist that hip scoring and eye checks are carried out to ensure we all maintain a happy and healthy breed. I am so impressed by the Spins nature and work, I don't require to look elsewhere for a good companion and worker. \n Now that I have bored the pants off all of you, please allow me to give some hard earned advice to future trainers and handlers. \n TRAINING TIPS \n 1. Do not start serious training until your pup is at least 6 months plus. (Take your time don't rush, remember it 's better to take your time and have a well trained dog which is going to last 10 years, than a monster, which is a pain in the bum for the rest of    its   natural life. \n 2. Do not allow your pup to retrieve sticks and stones, this very often causes hard mouth. Also don't play tug of war, you will only regret it, especially when your clever Spin brings in    its   first retrieve - you can't get much meat off a pair of pheasant wings whichever way you cook them. \n 3. Do not enforce walking to heel as this will only make if difficult when you expect your dog to leave your side to start hunting. \n 4.    Do   not try and force your pup to quarter for too long, this is a sure way of turning him into a plodder. \n 5. Do not take your pup to ground which has large amounts of rabbit scent, or you'll turn it into a hoover. Remember these    are   scenting dogs. \n 6. Just because Spins are gundogs it doesn't mean they enjoy having a gun fired over their heads. This is something which takes time and patience. \n 7. POINTING is something which very often happens over-night. Very careful monitoring of your pup as he starts to give any indication of pointing, needs to be encouraged once it starts. This generally begins with slight pointing, once your    pup   stops and stands still, quietly walk up alongside him. Do not approach along the line of the pups behind, this will often spook him, always approach from the flank, this way you won't upset the pup. When you 're alongside softly repeat the command 'HOLD', at the same time gently stroke the    pup 's   stomach, this has a soothing    effect.   When the pup is contented carefully raise his tail if not already done, bear in mind, the tail should only be in line with its back. After a short length of time flush the object being pointed by any means available to you. A word of warning do not try for the world record in pointing, as you will only encourage faults such as shaking, tail twitching or even worse moving in before being told to do so. \n WATERWORK should be done at the    pup 's   pace. Never get frustrated enough to throw a young dog into the deep end expecting it to swim like a fish, all you will do is scare the dog for life. \n I hope this hasn't been too boring for you all, as you can imagine there is a lot more to gundog training than meets the eye. It 's not as horrendous a picture as I may have painted it. There 's always a bright side to it, and nothing is more embarrassing than when at the end of a hard    day 's   trailing the judge asks your dog to make a    reasonably   difficult water retrieve, your faithful hound looks up at you and blatantly yawns before    sauntering   down to the water leisurely swims out and back makes his delivery looks at the judge and yawns again. Who could ask for more? \n So come on folks have a 'go'! STEVE KIMBERLEY \n\n\n<$D>\n  Preparing an Italian Spinone  \n How to start the task of preparing your Spinone. First of all start with a clean dog. Yes, he can have a bath! This should be done a week before the show. Beard and legs can be rinsed the night before For hand stripping your dog the best tool and the cheapest of course, is finger and thumb, a good stripping comb and thinning scissors. NEVER USE STRAIGHT SCISSORS \n THE HEAD:   Start with the head. The skull and occiput should be short and smooth. Gently strip towards the back skull and from the outer corner of the eyes to the beginning of the cheek. The eyebrow should be combed through, then gently strip out any over hanging brow. I have never found it necessary to trim the beard. If you use a fine comb regularly this keeps it in trim. However, this can be kept tidy with thinning scissors. EARS must also be kept tidy. They are set on level with the eyes, triangular in shape, slightly rounded at the tip, hanging no more than two inches at the jaw line. You can have a surplus of two inches or more hanging from the ears - this needs to come off. \n  THE NECK:    The Spinone is known for growing a lion 's ruff around the neck and shoulders. If this is not stripped out this can give the impression of no neck at all. Hand strip down the neck and shoulders. The dewlap should also be clean and tidy. Continue down from the shoulderblades and onto the back towards the tail. \n THE TAIL:   The tail should be carried out or down. If your Spinone carries his tail high the last thing   you   want to see is a flag hanging from it. \n LEGS:   Forelegs should be straight, bone oval, strong well defined tendons. Elbows neither turning in or out, pasterns slightly sloping when viewed from the side. If your Spinone has got all this why cover it with excess hair and fringing? The Standard says the coat should be shorter on the front of the limbs and on the feet. The same goes for the hindquarters. Particular attention should be made to keeping the elbows and hocks tidy, also the stifle. The Standard does not ask for exaggeration on this point, so again long fringing should not be left on. This includes the underline which should not be fringed excessively. Finally feet - front compact and round, hindfeet slightly oval, toes arched, covered with short hair especially between the toes. Nails strong and arched. If you find this area difficult to strip out it can be done with thinning scissors. \n The preparation of your Spinone should not be done in haste. Do a little at a time so he does not get bored and you don't make the mistake of taking off too much. The end result will be worth it.

{"text": "<Driving test>\n\n\n<$A>\n  All About the Driving Test  \n  REQUIREMENTS FOR UNDERGOING YOUR DRIVING TEST  \n 1. Take along a valid Irish provisional licence for the category of the driving test you are now undergoing. \n 2. Your vehicle must be in roadworthy condition, with lights, brakes and signals in working order. \n 3. Your vehicle must display a current tax disc with proper registration number shown. \n 4. Your vehicle must display a valid insurance disc (if Irish registered) with registration number, not chassis number, shown. \n 5. L plates (15 cm  2  ) with a red L on a white background should be displayed front and rear of all vehicles except motorbikes and tractors. \n 6. Bring along your appointment slip. If you cannot keep this appointment, you should give at least 10 days notice, otherwise you will forfeit your fee and have to re-apply for a new test. \n Conditions 1 to 5 are legal requirements. Failing any of these, your driving test will not be conducted and you will lose your fee and go back to the end of the waiting list. \n Please note that your driving examiner is exempt from wearing a seat belt (if he/she so wishes), do not insist on him/her wearing it. \n Also note that if either tax or insurance disc is faded or illegible, you must have them replaced prior to the test. Trade plates are not acceptable for undergoing your test. \n Use the boxes provided on page 9 to tick off requirements several days before your test, thus giving you the time to have everything in order for the day. \n  N.B.  If you have just realised that  your provisional licence is out of date  for the day of your test, you will need to have it replaced. This procedure is not as simple as it used to be. Driving licences or provisional licences are not handed out over the counter as was the practice previously. Now you must receive your documents through the post. In some areas this may take several weeks. However, if your driving test is imminent, you should bring your driving test appointment slip and a completed provisional licence form, not forgetting two photographs, to your relevant licencing authority, and see the supervisor in charge. He/she will normally issue your licence within a couple of hours. Note that the licence application, depending on your category, may require general medical information. You may use the form D501, available through your local tax office, and have it completed and signed by your general practitioner. Persons over the age of 70 will also need this certificate of fitness (D501). \n  Eyesight Test:  all applicants for a provisional licence for categories A1, A, B, EB or W must undergo a once-off eyesight test. If your optician has stated that you must wear corrective lenses, you should not forget them for the test, or indeed ever drive without them. This information is recorded on your licence with the words,  \"corrective lenses must be worn.\"  \n  Medical Test:  Applicants for a provisional licence for categories C, C1, D, D1, EC, EC1, ED or ED1 must undergo a medical examination (see page 101). \n  Special Driving Tests:  Candidates applying for a driving test, who have any disability (difficulty of hearing or any other physical disability) should have their practitioner fill out the form D501, certificate of fitness. It would also be courteous to include any detail they might find informative to the Department, e.g. any special adaptations to the vehicle they propose to use for the driving test. These should be attached and sent to:  The Driver Testing Section, Department of the Environment, Government Offices, Ballina, Co.Mayo. Phone: 096-70677 \n If you have any special queries regarding your particular disability, you should write to or phone the above address. \n  <&Irish> An Scr&/ud&/u Tiom&/ana&/iochta:  <&/Irish> \n (The Driving Test  in Irish  ) \n In order to undergo a driving test through the Irish language you must fill out a special application form, available through your local Motor Taxation Office. Your test will then be conducted through Irish, i.e. the Questions and Answers part of the test and directions for your practical driving. There is also a separate form for those wishing to have their Driving Licence document in Irish. To obtain these forms you should contact your local taxation office. \n\n  STEP BY STEP THROUGH THE TEST  \n The diagram shows the main points an examiner looks out for. They are not necessarily in order as it will depend on the examiner on the day and the direction he chooses to take. However, you may use it as a guide to the amount you will have to do on the day. \n The diagram on page 17 is based on a category B driving test (see page 12) which lasts about 45 minutes. Other categories may well last longer (see HGV, page 102). \n Do not overlook the minutes of relaxation after your driving test as you will have been stressed throughout that period. Rest for several minutes before returning to the road. This will have a calming down effect immediately after your test. \n  General procedure on the day of the test  \n Arrive at the test centre at least 10 minutes prior to your appointed time. You should wait in the waiting room and let the receptionist know you are there. Your name will be called in due course. \n The initial part will start after you produce your current Irish provisional licence to the examiner and sign the required administration forms including a Declaration of Road Worthiness and Insurance (see page 19). The Questions and Answers part of the examination should then take place, after which you will be asked to identify some road traffic signs. \n You will then accompany the examiner to the vehicle where he/she will check your tax and insurance disc and inspect your L plates (front and rear) and generally check the condition of your vehicle. In the case of a HGV, the examiner will check the lights, indicators, stop lights and generally all electrics, not forgetting the minimum number of mirrors, one left and one right. Before moving away, your examiner will say words to this effect:  \"There should be no further conversation in the vehicle between you and me other than to tell you to turn right or left. In the absence of a right or a left, I would like you to assume straight. If, however, you don't understand, you may ask and I will repeat.\"  Don't be unduly worried about this, as it is all part of the test. Try not to be put off by his/her presence in the vehicle. Your examiner may take notes during your diving test. Do not be alarmed at this as it is normal procedure. If you show that you are a competent and confident driver you should pass your test. Remember your training! \n He/she will ask you to move away and take whatever direction the examiner has planned. You will be asked to go right or left. For the most part, a high percentage of examiners will ask you to do a turnabout as a first manoeuvre, followed shortly by a reverse into a limited opening on the left. This is almost certainly followed by arm/handsignals and finally a hill start. This may not be the exact sequence in your test centre, as this will depend on the number of examiners working from the test centre on that day and on the obstructions and traffic within the areas intended for your manoeuvres. \n Your test route will be a well balanced drive including moving away, right turns, left turns, driving along main roads, emerging at junctions, traffic lights, use of traffic lanes, road position, use of controls, mirrors and signals. And remember general observation will play a very big part in your test. \n Almost before you know it, you will be on the way back to the test centre. You will have been concentrating so much, you will wonder where the time went! \n Examiners are not normally allowed to speak to you during your test. Most examiners will not do so. This is because it is felt that it would impair your concentration. In fact, many an examiner has been reprimanded for trying to calm a person down or for trying to help them relax. Complaints have been known to be made when such situations have occurred, this is why the rule now rigidly applies. \n On your return to the test centre, you will accompany the examiner into the centre where you will be informed whether you gained your Certificate of Competency or not. Examiners are not allowed to discuss the reasons for failing (see page 68 on the K Form). A very high percentage of failures are due to three main reasons: 1. faults relating to vehicle control and road procedure 2. lack of professional tuition 3. incorrect observation \n Remember, nerves alone should not bring about a refusal of a Certificate of Competency. \n  General points - Rules of the Road  \n Study the Rules of the Road handbook as this book,  The Driving Test in Ireland,  is not meant to replace the one which is issued by the National Safety Council for the Minister of the Environment. \n The contents of this government handbook are tested orally at the Questions and Answers part of the test. It is indeed recommended that a person who has passed the driving test should periodically read the latest edition, as new laws, regulations and EC directives are introduced all the time. \n You should be able to answer questions in your own words. You should know all the warning signs: regulatory and informative, road signs and road markings. A key factor in answering any question on the Rules of the Road would be to think of the safety aspect first. Although this book refers a lot to the \"Driving test\", it must go without saying that \"test standard\" is a good standard to maintain for the rest of your life. Never think, \"I have to drive like this for a test\" and the next day forget all you have been taught. Your life could depend on the good habits acquired under the guidance of your driving instructor! \n\n   Control Procedure   \n  COCKPIT DRILL  \n The proper procedure should be to demonstrate to the examiner the use of the normal everyday pre-start checks. \nD/S/S/S/M\n  Doors:  Make sure all doors are properly closed. \n  Seats:  Properly adjusted, mainly to suit your clutch control as this pedal is generally the only one that reaches the floor. \n  Steering:  Allow the back of your seat to be sufficiently forward for your arms not to have to stretch. A proper position would be with the elbows bent. \n  Seat belts:  Make sure you have placed your seat belts flat across your body with no twist as this could have the effect of a knife 's edge in the case of a sudden stop. \n  Mirrors:  Ensure that all available mirrors are adjusted to suit you and are kept clean at all times. Adjust inside mirror by using the top and bottom of the mirror base, without touching the glass itself. \n   USE OF CONTROLS   \n  Accelerator  \n You should be able to operate it smoothly and sensibly. Never accelerate too fast for the conditions you are driving in. This is for control reasons, not to mention the cost factor in doing so as the harsher the acceleration/deceleration is, the more fuel you use.\n  Footbrake  \n You should be able to stop smoothly, effectively and without jerking, except in an emergency. \n  Clutch  \n You should be able to operate your clutch smoothly, know your 'biting point' (gripping point) and use only when required. When finished using the clutch, remove your foot completely from the pedal as a partially depressed clutch will burn out the clutch. You should be able to coordinate the clutch with the handbrake and accelerator when moving off from a stationary position and when on a hill. Do not coast to a stop, that is to say, do not travel with your clutch depressed for an distance greater than necessary. \n  Steering  \n Keep both hands on the wheel at all times except when operating a control or giving a signal. Your hands should be level on the wheel i.e. ten to two or a quarter to three (clock face position). This is the best operating position for the pull/push movement which is recommended. \n  Horn  \n Many people are reluctant to use the horn during a driving test when in fact, at times, it is imperative. For instance, it could be recommended to attract the attention of a pedestrian who is about to step onto the road in front of you and who, you feel, is not aware of you presence, or in a sharp turn where visibility is limited or obscured. \n These are just two instances. However, normal use of this instrument should not be excessive or aggressive. \n One should also note that between the hours of 11.30 pm (23.30) and 7.00 am (07.00), the horn should not be used except for a traffic emergency.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "61efedd8-4cd8-4461-ad8e-d9a848b09543", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.684822+00:00"}
{"text": "<Home protection>\n\n\n<$A>\n  Introduction  \n This booklet is intended to provide you with some basic information on HOME PROTECTION. We know that your home is very special to you, as the place where you feel safest and most relaxed. It also contains some very valuable property, if not in a commercial sense, then certainly in terms of its sentimental worth. There is no insurance policy which could compensate you adequately for the loss and upset which can result from a burglary. That 's why you should minimise the risk of having your home broken into, and the contents stolen. \n There are some very simple steps you can take, which will help improve the physical security of your home, and allay some of your fears. Many of these will cost you nothing more than a few moments of your time. Other measures may be more expensive, and may range in price from several pounds to several hundred pounds - but we 'll have a look at some of these later on. It 's best to begin with the most obvious and easiest steps. \n As a starting point for considering the safety of    your   home, let 's look at it from the burglar 's point of view. What type of signs would help him target your home? \n  Signs of vacancy  \n Burglars tend to be skilled in recognizing signs which indicate that a particular house is vacant. This means that it is unlikely that they will be disturbed on entry and helps to explain why 80 <*> per cent sign </*> of burglaries take place in unoccupied homes. \n The following are some of the things a burglar looks for: A build-up of milk on the door-step A build-up of papers and advertisements in the letter box\nA build-up of letters in the hall visible from outside Blinds pulled down, or curtains across during the day No lights on at night, or just 'dead' lights like in the porch, or the hall Lights on during the day Front gates closed and no car in the drive way Notes left for delivery men or callers Uncut lawn and untidy garden \n Obviously any of these occurring by itself does not confirm that the premises are unoccupied. But they are some of the criteria thieves use to target their victims. There more signs there are, the more certain they can be that nobody is at home. \n These tell-tale signs can be easily avoided by a little personal care and attention. If you live in a neighbourhood Watch Area, it is likely that you and your neighbour will already have developed a greater awareness of the need to take such precautions. If you are not a member, why not make some enquiries about the advantages of this crime prevention programme. \n Modern technology can also be of assistance in quite inexpensive ways. For example, you can purchase a time switch quite cheaply and use this to turn on and off lights automatically at the appropriate times. It can also be used to control radios and televisions to simulate that someone is present in the house; but do make sure that you follow the manufacturer 's recommendations and don't compromise your fire safety. \n An outside light, especially at the rear of the building can also act as a deterrent - burglars certainly don't want to be seen. This may go against your natural desire for privacy, which may also require fences and hedges. Sometimes there can be a trade-off between privacy and security, with the 'happy medium' being a matter of personal choice. \n  An open invitation  \n After you have eliminated any clear indications of unoccupancy, the next step is to make sure that you do not invite the burglar in through carelessness. Most burglars are opportunists and will select the easiest target that they can find. \n Don't offer him assistance by: Leaving any window open. Some people do this for ventilation forgetting that burglars will take advantage of the smallest opening. Leaving external doors unlocked. Leaving a key on a string, under a door-mat, or in some other 'good hiding place' outside. Failing to secure side doors, allowing entry to the back of the premises which is more vulnerable to attack. Failing to keep garages and sheds locked. Not only do they contain valuable property, but also tools which may help the burglar to gain access to your home. \n Also make sure that ladders are not left in the open, or in insecure positions. In most circumstances the thief will tend not to carry tools, or equipment with him for fear of detection. Don't make his job any easier by providing them at the 'site'. \n Simply by taking these straight forward crime prevention measures brings you well on the road to achieving greater household security. These measures alone will decrease the likelihood that you will be the burglar 's next victim. \n  Keeping the intruder out  \n There is still more that you can do to improve your security. At this stage you have reached a point where any would be burglar can only gain entry by physically breaking into your home. In many cases he can be deterred from doing this by the proper use of locks and bolts. \n  WINDOWS  \n Windows form a popular entry point for burglars, and it has been estimated that more than two thirds gain entry in this way. The risk partly depends on two factors. The first is how accessible the window is, and the second is how clearly visible the window is to your neighbours and passers-by. Therefore, those windows at the rear and side of the building, which can be easily reached from the ground, or via pipes, or adjoining roofs are most vulnerable. \n Obviously windows which have not been left open must be broken, or prised to allow the burglar to put his hand through to release any catch or fitting. If window locks are fitted, his task is so much more difficult. This may force him to smash an area large enough to climb through. Breaking glass may attract attention and few burglars will want to risk it. \n Furthermore, do remember not to leave the keys to the window locks where they can be seen, or are within easy reach. The style of the window can also have a bearing on vulnerability. For example, certain types of louvre windows are particularly risky wherein the glass panels can easily be removed. \n Various types of window locking devices are displayed below.. You should choose a lock which is suitable to your window, whether it is a sash window, a french window,    or   whether it is wooden or metal framed. \n  DOORS  \n Doors, particularly those at the side and rear of the dwelling are also likely entry points. Consequently, they require special attention. It is also important to consider any door which gives access to these sites, including garage doors. Many of the better quality locks will give extra protection against attacks from    jemmies   , crowbars, hand-drills and picks - some of the favourite tools of the burglar. On the other hand, many outside doors are still being fitted with a type of lock which can be slipped open with a piece of plastic. \n Displayed....are two types of locks which are commonly found on external front doors. A rim lock    is attached to the surface of the door. A mortice lock which is superior. \n We recommend that as a minimum precaution all external doors are fitted with the five lever mortice lock. In this case, the lock is actually recessed into the door itself, as can be seen from the drawing. Door leaf should be at least 44mm in thickness to allow adequate strength after    mortice   lock has been fitted. \n Mortice security bolts serve a similar purpose and can be used independently, or to augment existing security arrangements. Hinge bolts also serve to boost door security and are especially useful on doors with exposed hinges, offering protection even should the hinges themselves be removed. \n The quality of the door and the materials used, will also    affect   its strength against attack. If the design of the door is weak, then it will be difficult to compensate for this by using high security lock. For example, hollow doors are not suitable for external fittings, and should be confined to internal use only. \n Besides the illustrations of some typical door locks, currently on the market, we have included door limiters. These provide some security when you are at home by helping you to control access. You should also consider fitting a door viewer. This will enable you to identify the caller without having to open the door. \n  FIREARMS <*> ampersand </*> AMMUNITION  \n If you are the holder of licensed firearms, or ammunition, you should take special precautions to ensure their safety. A steel gun locker is a worthwhile purchase which will afford a high level of security and give a life-time 's service. If you don't have one of these then keep the firearm and ammunition separately, and remove the firing mechanism and magazine. This will prevent the easy unlawful use of the weapon, not only by criminals but also by inquisitive children. \n  OTHER PROPERTY  \n Whatever the nature of your property, be sure that you have an adequate record of it and that, where possible, it is also marked with your own property number. \n  RECORDING PROPERTY  \n The benefits of marking property are that: It greatly increases the likelihood of stolen property being returned to the owner. As you probably already know, a great deal of property remains unclaimed in Garda possession as the owners cannot be identified. It will make the property less attractive to the thief. He will not be able to readily dispose of property that is marked and can be easily identified. Generally, he will not want to steal goods that he cannot resell. \n  Inside the house  \n When you are away from home, we recommend that you normally should not lock weak internal doors. They offer very little resistance and may result in unnecessary damage. If the intruder has gained access it is unlikely that these will prove realistic deterrents. For similar reasons it is also felt that cupboards and bureaus should not be locked. Moreover, in no circumstances should these ever be considered as providing sufficient protection for your valuables. \n  CASH  \n In the first instance, you should limit the amount of cash left in the home. Don't leave money in dishes or jars in anticipation of paying some bill. \n  JEWELLERY  \n All jewellery should be locked out of sight when you are not at home - either in a small floor safe or some similar protective casing. You could just as easily protect it by leaving it with a relative or friend, particularly if you intend to be away for some time. Some banks also offer this holding facility. \n  BICYCLES  \n Bicycles are very valuable items of property    sometimes   carelessly left around the house. Once off the street there is a tendency to forget the danger from thieves. However, many bicycles are stolen from backyards and side passages. Always have your bicycle locked when not in use. \n  PROPERTY MARKING NUMBER  \n A property marking number is simply a specific number used to identify your property. We recommend that you use your date of birth as initials, for example: \n If your name is John A. Dunne, born on the 13/11/43, then your property number would be 131143 JAD. You put this number on all appropriate items of your property, using one of the methods outlined below. You then fill out a card with this information, and return it to your local Garda Station.\n The items which should be marked are those most likely to be stolen, especially portable electrical and mechanical goods. In the event of property being stolen and later recovered, the Gardai will have no trouble in matching the property with its rightful owners. \n  PROPERTY MARKING  \n You can mark your property with any of the following. 1. An ultra-violet pen 2. An electric engraver 3. An indelible marker 4. An etching tool 5. A series of metal punches, the precise method will depend on the nature of the property that you are marking; on whether or not it is glass, metal, wood, fabric etc. There are some items of property which you will not want to mark because of their individual character or value, e.g. crystal, items of jewellery or antiques. Those items should be photographed. \n If you wish to know more about the property marking scheme, contact your local Garda Station. \n  Conclusion  \n This booklet has been confined to suggesting basic ways and means of increasing your home protection. That 's why it has not dealt with alarms, safes, security fencing, etc. We do not want you to feel that you have to convert your home into a fortress, as a little thoughtfulness can prevent many burglaries from occurring. However, should you feel that you may require these types of systems to meet your personal needs and circumstances, always make sure that they comply with accepted standards as in the case of the current Irish Standards for burglar alarms I.S.199. Additional professional advice can be obtained freely from the Crime Prevention Officer. \n You now know that crime prevention does not need to be expensive or technical. Common sense and a few pounds will put you on the road to greater security - start with the doors, and then move on to the windows until you have a security system in which you can trust. The Gardai are always prepared to assist you in this development. Call your local station should you have any questions related to this subject.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "b71439e5-ff1c-4d2a-9020-17624ff94c80", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.686426+00:00"}
{"text": "<Harmony report>\n\n\n<$A>\n  HARMONY ANNUAL REPORT 1989/90 \n 1 INTRODUCTION  \n Another year has passed swiftly bringing us to A.G.M. time again, and also to present the Annual Report. Both are a crucial part of any organisation. The first is to discuss all matters relevant to the organisation, to make decisions and to plan and set targets for the future. The second helps us see how we are doing. Have we done all that we intended? Have we reached our targets? What were our activities during the year? Both help us to progress as an organisation. All of this presupposes that all members of Harmony take an active part. So all members should be actively involved. Actively involved means - coming to Harmony functions and meetings; helping to plan events; helping at events; expressing ideas and options and always keeping in touch with what is going on. \n What follows in the Annual Report is a chronological list of main events and a review of what Harmony did during 1989/90. It is an attempt to give all members a comprehensive view of what the organisation is achieving from year to year. At times it may seem that little is happening, but when you see everything that has happened listed it is clear that Harmony is very active and progressing rapidly towards achieving its goals. \n We may underestimate sometimes what we are capable of, and yet, reviewing the year makes it clear that once we are determined enough to achieve a certain target, we can do it. \n\n 2.2  SUB-COMMITTEES: LEGISLATION  \n \"RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IN IRELAND - REALITIES AND REMEDIES\" A Report by Harmony, was launched. See events - March. \n  NEWSLETTER  \n Five Newsletters were produced, keeping members informed of events. The style and content was improved. \n  SOCIAL/CULTURAL  \n This Committee was very active, organising many events. See Main Events section of Annual Report. \n  FINANCE  \n A lot of work was put into fund raising, including applications for Grant Assistance from philanthropic organisations and state agencies. \n  REFUGEE  \n This Sub-Committee was set up to increase Harmony 's awareness of the refugee situation in Ireland. An Irish Refugee Council has been initiated by interested bodies. Harmony hopes to be associated with their work. \n  DEVELOPMENT  \n Robbie McVeigh, Belfast, expressed interest in helping to establish a Harmony branch in Belfast. We intend to give him every support possible in 1991 to achieve this aim. \n 3  MAIN EVENTS SEPTEMBER 1989 - AUGUST 1990\n 3.1  SEPTEMBER \n TRAINING COURSE  \n Harmony Committee members attended a Training Course on Administration run by Tom Curran and Rita McNulty of NYCI. \n  KORA RECITAL  \n Because of the uniqueness of the occasion of the visit of Jali Amadu Bansang Jobarteh, Mandinka Kora player from The Gambia, the Committee decided to support this concert in TCD as the cultural activity for September. \n 3.2  OCTOBER \n  INDIAN EVENING  \n The new venue for the social meetings was the Russell Court Hotel, Harcourt St. This enjoyable evening was attended by approximately 100 people. There was an exhibition of children 's art and puppets, on Indian themes, as well as music and tasty Indian food. \n  NOVEMBER  \n  ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING  \n A report of the last year 's work carried out by the Committee and the yearly accounts were presented at the AGM. The new Committee was elected. The Committee and members of Harmony renewed their commitment to work towards achieving Harmony 's aims and objectives. \n 3.1  DECEMBER  \n  CHILDREN 'S PARTY  \n The annual Children 's Party was as big a success as ever. The usual components were there - bouncing castle, food, face painting, pop music and games. As in previous years there were two Santas - one black, one white - adding a special atmosphere of the uniqueness of Harmony. \n 3.5  JANUARY  \n The Sub-Committees were re-established and work got under way. \n 3.6  FEBRUARY  \n  LIBRARY  \n Bernie Moloney and Chris Lavin Sedaca, both members, donated books to the Library, which is in the process of being established. Members will have access in due course. We wish to thank Bernie and Chris for their kind donations. \n 3.7  MARCH  \n  GHANAIAN EVENING  \n Some beautiful craftwork was on display. Typical Ghanaian food and music were enjoyed by over 100 people at this lively evening. \n  LAUNCH OF HARMONY REPORT  \n  RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IN IRELAND - REALITIES AND REMEDIES  \n This Report was launched in Buswell 's Hotel by the Minister for Justice, Mr Ray Bourke, TD. The D&/ail, Churches, Embassies and many other organisations throughout Ireland were well represented at this successful event. Much media attention was attracted, leading to a number of new members. \n The Launch was held on 21 March, to mark the United Nations Day for the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination. \n 3.8  APRIL  \n  ZIMBABWEAN EVENING  \n This was another highly popular evening. The food was superb and the music and interesting craft display added to the atmosphere of general enjoyment for all those who attended. \n 3.9  May  \n  PHILIPPINO EVENING  \n An equally successful event. The delicious food was sampled by a large number of people, accompanied by a background of well chosen music. \n 3.10  JUNE  \n  THE GOVERNMENT INSPECTOR - PROJECT THEATRE  \n We were invited by the Project Theatre management to use a performance of \"The Government Inspector\" as an opportunity to raise funds for Harmony. \n The British Ambassador, Sir Nicholas <*> ampersand </*> Lady Fenn, attended this event. After the performance members of the Tara Arts Group mingled with the capacity audience at a wine reception. The success of this reception was due in no small measure to the generosity of His Excellency, the Indian Ambassador and Gilbey 's of Ireland, who both donated the wine. \n A lot of organisation went into this successful venture, which proved Harmony 's capability in organising major cultural events. \n 3.11  JULY  \n  NELSON MANDELA 'S VISIT  \n Harmony was associated with Nelson Mandela 's visit to Ireland by contributing financially to the production of a commemorative brochure for the event. Harmony, as an organisation, and its members, participated in this historic occasion by attending functions associated with the visit. \n  FAMILY OUTING  \n The Family Outing was again to Duckett 's Grove riding School. This annual event is proving very popular. Over seventy people, both adults and children, travelled to the venue in comfort on a coach provided by Harmony. \n 3.12  OFFICE  \n The office has now been decorated. The generous donations of Hugh Forkan (who provided the paint) and Michael Doyle of Doyle 's Hotels (who provided the carpets) helped immeasurably to make this possible. \n We are not in a position to make the office more available to the members of Harmony. So in 1990/91, it will be used for administration purposes, but also as a meeting place and resource centre for all who wish to avail of it. \n The hours of opening are to be announced at the AGM. \n 4  REVIEW OF THE YEAR  \n 4.1  CAMPAIGN FOR LEGISLATION  \n During the year Harmony kept up the pressure for the introduction of Race Relations and Anti-Discrimination Legislation especially in the launch of the Harmony Report  Racial Discrimination in Ireland - Realities and Remedies  \n The Minister for Justice and Spokespersons for Justice were contacted in relation to this Report. The Minister for Justice, Mr Ray Burke, TD launched the Report. While we do not overestimate the significance of his attendance at the launch, we feel that it is a further step on the way to adequate race relations legislation in Ireland. At least the Minister is now aware of the importance and necessity for this legislation. \n The pressure to have such legislation introduced must be maintained on the Minister and his Department. \n 4.2  MEDIA WATCH  \n Each issues of the Newsletter contains a Media Watch. The following is a selection of Media Watch items:\n Gardai are hunting two vicious attackers who threw acid in the face of an Indian businessman in Dublin causing serious burns. IRISH PRESS 11.10.89 \n Two English brothers hurled racist abuse at an Indian woman during an affray at a Dublin take-away. They shouted remarks about the owner 's colour and racial background. They threw things round the shop and grabbed her arm. They were later arrested. Both were found guilty and ordered to pay <*> pound sign </*> 40.00 and to leave the country immediately. IRISH PRESS 19.9.89 \n A group of Hong Kong businessmen propose to invest up to <*> pound sign </*> 100m in the economy in return for State support and Irish Citizenship. Government response has been lukewarm. IRISH PRESS 18.12.89 \n The Minister for Education presented twelve Vietnamese students in Waterford with certificates having completed an English language course with local VEC. Three children born to Vietnamese parents, already speak Vietnamese, Chinese, English and Irish. WATERFORD NEWS & STAR 30.3.90 \n The son of a Jordanian Government Minister, failed his High Court bid to prevent    deportation   from Ireland. He is alleged to have arrived at Dublin Airport with valid visa, was refused entry and deported, because he did no have sufficient proof of financial resources. IRISH PRESS 2.5.90 \n A Somalian who has been held in Limerick prison for the past seven weeks is to be put aboard a Moscow bound flight this evening - despite his claim that he will be shot if sent home. IRISH PRESS 4.7.90 \n We continue to monitor racist incidents reported in the media. \n4.3   PUBLICITY  \n Harmony received a high level of publicity in all sections of the media during the year. This was due in a large measure to the successful launch of our Report. \n This media attention resulted in many members of the Committee being interviewed on radio and television, and in the newspapers. We believe, as a result, that many people 's awareness of the existence of Harmony and its objectives, is now higher. This new level of interest has been demonstrated by the many enquiries and new members in the aftermath of the launch. We hope that in 1991 that we    will be able to maintain this increased support for Harmony. \n 4.4  FUNDING  \n 1989/90 was a very successful year for our fund raising campaign. Grants were received from One World - Our World Committee and the Irish Youth Foundation. \n Some of our social/cultural evenings, while not specifically fund raising events yielded a very welcome profit. \n Letters were also sent to businesses in various parts of the country, and have resulted in an injection of funds. \n 5  OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK  \n As this Annual Report demonstrates, Harmony has been strengthened and has become more established in the past year. The Committee has been exceptionally active, and the Sub-Committees put a lot of energy into organising events in areas of - legislation, social/cultural, fund raising and Newsletter. \n Now that the office is fit for habitation, it is time to seek funding to enable us to employ staff. \n Because of racist incidents both in Ireland and globally, the contributions of an organisation like Harmony are invaluable. Further commitment and involvement from both the Committee and Members is imperative for the coming year, to enable us to work together and continue building bridges towards a racism free Ireland. \n 6  CONCLUSION  \n In conclusion Harmony wishes to thank the many people and organisations who supported us in our aims and participated in our events and campaign for legislation. \n We wish to thank those organisations and individuals who generously contributed financially to Harmony. \n To all those members who helped in the organisation of events, to those who donated prizes for raffles and to those who supported each other in the true spirit of HARMONY - a special thanks.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "350af08e-54c4-4ee0-82ae-ca23f904a716", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.687627+00:00"}
{"text": "<Irish Jewish Museum>\n\n\n<$A>\n EDITORIAL \n This was the first bulletin to be produced by the team working on the FAS/Irish Jewish Museum project. By issuing the bulletin we hope to keep you in the community aware of the work we are doing here and to encourage anyone who wishes to become involved at the museum. \n The project, which has been running since July 23rd, has two basic aims. The first is to produce a usable catalogue of all the material stored in the museum. As a part of this we hope to run occasional exhibitions on aspects of the museum. The first such will highlight the paintings and portraits on display here. \n The second aim the project has is to research the history of Jewish settlement in Ireland. We expect to be concentrating on the settlement in and around Dublin and to this end we hope that the work will involve interviews with members of the Jewish Community. \n The course is expected to last at least twelve months. The trainees working on the project will be taught many research skills including Word Processing and report writing. It is hoped also that the trainees will acquire basic preservation and restoration skills. \n Another aspect of the course will involve the trainees being taught French as it is actually spoken rather than by grammatical means. (The aim would not be to produce fluent French speakers, but to give the trainees basic conversational skills). \n Any help that any individual member of the community can give us in our work would be gratefully received. \n Participants in the Irish Jewish museum project are;\nCo-Ordinator; Eoin Duffy. Assistant Co-Ordinators; Marie Christine Gallonnier and Rosemary Horan. \n Research Assistants; James Corrigan, Raymond Farrell, Ross Hackett, Niamh Hayden, Gerard Lysaght, Ronan Mac Aongusa, Mary T. Murphy, Susan Nolan, Francis O'Doherty, Deborah Paget, Damien Walker. \n Eoin Duffy \n\n\n<$B>\n EXHIBITION OF PAINTINGS FROM THE MUSEUM COLLECTION \n An exhibition of paintings is being organised from the collection in the museum. Featuring in it will be works by Harry Kernoff and Estella Solomons. These include oil paintings, pastels, pencil drawings and prints. Both artists were well known in their time for recording everyday scenes of Dublin life, some of which have been used as illustrations in publications. \n A lot of preparation is being put into organising this exhibition, with research being carried out in the National Library and the National Gallery. Accompanying it will be a leaflet, giving a brief outline on the lives of the artists and also a short note on the works exhibited. \n This is the first of many public events to be held in the museum during the coming months. It will also give visitors an opportunity to view the other exhibits in the museum. \n Further details on the exhibition will be posted out to the community in advance. All are welcome! Susan Nolan \n\n\n<$C>\n THE COMPUTERISATION OF THE MUSEUM ARTIFACTS \n As many of you may already know, we are computerising the artifacts and archives of the museum. As there is limited storage space on the premises, it was decided that it would be impractical to hold paper records. Therefore all data is being stored on the computer 's hard disk and is backed up on floppy disks. \n Thanks to the Co-Ordinator of the Clondalkin and Ballyfermot FAS project, Brendan Teeling, we have a Data Base III plus programme which has been customised for our particular purposes. \n Due to having some past experience, the computing has become a major element of my work at the museum. Currently we are inputting entries for each item in the Synagogue section of the museum, a task which is nearing completion. The speed at which we are progressing is entirely due to the \"user friendly\" nature of the DBase programme. \n When all the records have been stored in the computer 's memory, it will be necessary to devise a programme which allows the information to be readily accessible to anyone wishing to use it. This will involve the creation of standard \"search headings\". By this I mean that all information relating to common topics will be stored under the same heading. This will ensure that the data will be in the most accessible form possible. \n In the long term, the records will be available for the purpose of serious research, and above all there will be a working catalogue of the contents of the museum available to all. This will help to ensure that a permanent record of the Irish Jewish Community will be retained for future generations. \n If anyone is particularly interested in this aspect of the project, call to the museum where I would be more than willing to arrange a time to give a demonstration.

Its objective is that the trainees become used to hearing and to speaking a foreign language. This will become more and more useful, as we are on the brink of 1992. Also a good knowledge of French will give the trainees and added advantage in the job market. \n For that reason, the ability to speak the language is more important than being able to read or write it. In most cases, the trainees already had the grammatical approach at school, while the oral one was neglected, so books are used as little as possible, while conversation is the main aim. The Alliance Fran&5caise runs several types of activities, of which the most interesting to the trainees are the films shows. These movies are in French and un-subtitled. This exercise is excellent in that it helps the trainees to become accustomed to the new language. \n The second objective of this module is to produce the Irish Jewish Museum catalogue in bilingual form. Currently we are planning an exhibition, centred on H. Kernoff and E. Solomons. All the text concerning the exhibition has already been translated into French by the trainees and put in the computer. \n Contacts have been established with the new Jewish Museum which is going to be opened in Paris in 1992. The Irish Jewish Museum will send it the different catalogue, booklets and brochures which we will produce in French. Maybe an exchange of items, for exhibitions for instance, could be organised? Marie Christine Galonnier \n\n\n<$E>\n TALKS GIVEN BY THE JEWISH COMMUNITY \n Since our project began our knowledge of the Jewish way of life has greatly increased due to various members of the Jewish community coming into the museum to give us talks. \n Raphael Siev introduced us to the museum with a discussion on the history of the Synagogue in Walworth Road, which helped a great deal as it gave us an insight into when and where the artefacts came from the gave us a background and history to the objects we are cataloguing. \n From the kitchen in the museum, Mrs. Joan Lynn explained some of the different elements of Jewish family life to us. The different parental roles and the importance of the Dietary Laws. \n A general outline of Jewish settlement in Ireland was given by Asher Benson and Mrs. Marilyn Taylor spoke on many different aspects of Judaism. \n From talks about the Jews and the Jewish way of life, Friday afternoons developed into other areas concerning Irish life. How Focus Point and The Simon Community opened our eyes to homelessness in Ireland, and how these organisations have grown over the years. \n We would appreciate any input from members of the community and maintain all contacts we have made so far. Niamh Hayden \n\n\n<$F>\n<$G>\n LIMERICK 1904 \n On joining the Irish Jewish Museum project, we were particularly involved in researching Jewish settlement in Limerick. In the course of the research, we investigated the growth of the Jewish population in Limerick and the events which occurred there during 1904. This, of course, involved investigating the infamous sermons preached by Redemptorist priest Rev. Fr. John Creagh, his motives for preaching those sermons and the reactions of various members of the community to them and their consequences, particularly the economic boycott of the Jewish community which resulted. \n Interest in the events which occurred in Limerick was still evident in 1984 when The Irish Times became the forum for a series of letters contributed by different    correspondents,   including Mr Jim Kemmy, Mr Pat Kelly, Mr. Manus O'Riordan, researcher with the I.T.G.W.U. and Fr. Michael Baily, a Redemptorist priest. \n While Fr. Baily was at pains to justify Fr. Creagh 's outbursts, denouncing Rabbi Elias Bere Levin as a master of public relations, the other contributors all disagreed with claims by Creagh apologists that the priest was only acting in defence of the poor, illiterate members of the Limerick population. Indeed, several writers pointed out that the speed at which the Jewish community disintegrated with the onset of the economic boycott was the ultimate refutation of Creagh 's position and his accusation that the Limerick Jews were \"moneylenders\". It has also been suggested that Fr. Creagh 's motives had less to do with his desire to protect the population of Limerick from \"Jewish moneylenders\" and more to do with the survival of his co-operative bank which was in the process of being established. \n The interest in the events of 1904 lies in the fact that it was the only popular demonstration of anti-semitism ever to take place in Ireland. It succeeded in destroying Limerick 's tiny Jewish community. Ironically though it led to the downfall of the man who instigated the whole sorry story. Shortly after the \"pogrom\", Fr. Creagh was disowned by the Catholic hierarchy, who had remained silent throughout the crisis. He left for Australia to work with the pearl fishermen there. Francis O'Doherty <*> ampersand </*> Gerard Lysaght \n\n\n<$H>\n <&Hebrew> CHADASHOT <&/Hebrew> \n <&Hebrew> Chadashot </&Hebrew> began publication in 1963 boasting to be  \"Dublin 's only Jewish weekly\".  It was entirely written and published by the young, but served the community as a whole. Over the years it had to compete with other Jewish magazines but more of these were short-lived while <&Hebrew> Chadashot </&Hebrew> remained constant. \n The aims of <&Hebrew> Chadashot </&Hebrew> were to inform on up-coming events, report on past events, but most of all to give an editorial on community topics. This often got them into trouble. The editorial was often of a serious nature, so to compensate, the remainder of the magazine was generally written with a light-hearted air. There was a sports column giving details of results and matches at Maccabi. It also served the community by announcing births, deaths, wedding, engagements, etc. and in general kept its    readership   up to date. \n Even though it claimed to be a \"weekly\" magazine it would sometimes be delayed a couple of weeks due to insufficient funds or staff shortages. On a few occasions it had to become a monthly or fortnightly. \n <&Hebrew> Chadashot </&Hebrew> was looked on with furrowed brows by elders and prominent members of the community for its    irreverent   and often controversial stance on important topics. It often had to print apologies but overall it maintained the support of most of the community. \n It received many \"angry\" letters over the years, but just as many expressed gratitude for dealing with topics which needed airing. \n <&Hebrew> Chadashot </&Hebrew> stopped publication in the early 1970s' due to the editorial staff (who were voluntary) going on to do other things. In its seven years of existence it produced interest and enthusiasm never since re-created. It is true to say that it is missed. Ross Hackett \n\n\n<$I>\n MAN CAN NOT LIVE ON BREAD ALONE \n (Or the importance of the apple danish in the lives of FAS trainees) \n Whilst cataloguing some of the archival material in the museum I came across an article on one Morgan Hackett and his Bretzel bakery situated just around the corner from us in Lennox Street. The heading caught my eye for one of two reasons, one because it involved food and two because it said that  \"Ireland leads the way with Kosher pizza\".  What, I wondered, was special about a Kosher pizza. \n I 'm not quite sure who was the first of our merry little bunch to actually venture down Lennox Street, I think it may have been Frank with his weakness for doughnuts, but that was it. WE were hooked. Thereafter, everyday at 11 o'clock sharp one of us would take orders and undertake the pilgrimage down to the Bretzel so as to feed our compatriots. \n This is not only an important stop-off for FAS trainees but also an important focal point for the whole of the Dublin-Jewish community. Mr. Hackett inherited the bakery from his father Christie who as an assistant to a Kosher baker learned the skill first and the religious significance of his work later. He passed on his skill to Morgan who is now one of the most popular bakers in Dublin 's inner city. \n Morgan is also a very popular man at times of weddings, Bar Mitzvahs and other events and one of his favourite orders for such occasions is his St.    Honore 's   Gateau. St. Honore is the patron saint of bakers and with Morgan being a devout Catholic it seems an appropriate name. \n The shop itself has become a meeting place on Sunday mornings for long standing customers and members of the community. They meet there for a chat and to buy their favourite pastries and breads. Working on this course has opened my eyes to the cultural elements of the Jewish religion but my favourite bit so far was my introduction to the Kosher apple danish.

{"text": "<Ulster editorials 1>\n\n\n<$A>\n  EDITORIAL  \n The Government 's announcement that 31 pits are to be closed illustrates the truly uncaring nature of this unfair administration. Despite Mr.    Heseltine 's   umming and erring ('cause he 's realised the size of the anti-government feeling) there is no    commitment   to improving the quality of peoples lives and his feeling of \"sadness\" for the mining community gives crying crocodiles a bad name. Since 1979 the Conservative party has embarked on the campaign of privatisation and has always defended its policies by uttering the old buzz words like 'free market' and 'accountability'. The glorious revolution they unleashed has witnessed a growing polarity between rich and poor (at its greatest level since the late 1800 's), a rise in the level of unemployment (Labour isn't working eh?), an effective dismantling of the welfare state and (this bit affects you) a reduction in the standard of living for students. The heyday of voodoo economics has been and gone, our national assets have been sold off (anyone seen Sid recently?) we now stand on the edge of an abyss in which severities are stretched to extremes. In other words we 're all doomed! \n However, there is light at the end of the tunnel. Opposition to the government is at an all time high; miners, nuclear power workers, railway workers teachers the unemployed and (hopefully) that humungous sponge they call the student population are uniting to march on parliament. The old system of privatisation has shown itself to be incompetent. Reinvestment is needed, subsidies are called for , education needs expanding, the sick need looking after, industry needs a boost. \n Now is the time to extend the hand of comraderie, put those differences behind you and give the Government the big 'V'. \n\n\n<$B>\n  MORNING VIEW  \n  Peace mission lacks credibility  \n THE close working relationship between Prime Minister John Major and Ulster Unionist leader James Molyneaux will be under considerable strain when the pair meet for talks this week.And no wonder. \n The willingness of the Government to appease Sinn Fein and the IRA so as to get them to accept the Downing Street Declaration has undermined the security operation to such an extent that the terrorists are now effectively calling the shots, in terms of violence and propaganda. \n The nightly debacle at Heathrow has made security at Europe 's busiest airport a sick joke, yet the Government clings to the mistaken belief that those responsible for these murderous attacks can be persuaded peaceful political aims. \n Government ineptitude has allowed the IRA to make significant gains from its 25 years of shooting and bombing and, as long as this weakness continues in high places, the Provisionals are not going to assume a position where they are merely a marginal political party with less than 10 per cent of electoral support in Northern Ireland and 2 per cent in Eire. \n They believe there are more political concessions in the pipeline and are prepared to kill to secure them. \n Unionists are not only appalled by the Government 's apparent soft line on terrorism and its willingness to do Dublin 's bidding. \n John Major 's Tory back-benchers are also demanding an urgent reappraisal of Government policy to take account of the dangerous situation that has developed in the three months since the signing of the Declaration on December 15. \n Peace has now become the most over-used word in the vocabulary of the political rulers in both London and Dublin as they pathetically wait for the response of the IRA and Sinn Fein to the Declaration, content only to fire a barrage of words. \n John Major and Albert Reynolds are indeed beginning to look ridiculous, as they shake their fists indignantly at the Heathrow bombers and declare:  \"You are making a grave miscalculation.\"  \n Their impotence in the face of the IRA 's continuing campaign is matched only by the feeble response of the Ulster Secretary of State Sir Patrick Mayhew who keeps telling us the peace process is  \"still on the rails\" . \n His must be the peace that by-passes all understanding of those who live with the daily nightmare of terrorism and realise that the IRA has absolutely no intention of calling a permanent ceasefire, and a surrender of arms, ammunition and explosives. \n This view was confirmed by an IRA statement last night which ruled out an end of the terror unless the Government caves into its demands - to talk and to negotiate the ending of the British presence in Northern Ireland. \n A year has elapsed since SDLP leader John Hume brought Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams in from isolation to a centre stage position and in that time the only people whose cause has been advanced are the Provsionals. \n As the mortars rain down on Heathrow Airport and killers stalk the streets of our cities and towns of our Province, there is a political instability here not known since the IRA hunger strike of 1981. \n The Westminster Government has only one option it can take if democracy is to be upheld and real peace returned to this Province. It must move decisively against the terrorists with proper security measures and must make it abundantly clear that the position of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom is inviolable. \n Last night 's IRA statement served a purpose in that in clarified to our Government the spurious \"peace\" agenda republicans are working to. \n John Major and his Government can no longer afford to be pawns in a process that merely facilitates the terrorists. \n\n\n<$C>\n  Rape attack outrage  \n The death of an 85-year-old West Belfast woman three days after she was brutally raped in her home is an awful indictment of the kind of people who are sadly at loose in our society. \n Mrs Mary Palmer took the terrible suffering and distress she endured to the grave and everything possible must be done to bring to justice the person or persons responsible for her death. \n The RUC must be given all the help by the decent people of West Belfast in their inquiries. \n\n\n<$D>\n  MORNING VIEW  \n  Violence must not set the agenda  \n SDLP leader John Hume 's credibility as a constitutional politician is wearing a bit thin these days as he assumes an increasing role as an apologist for the IRA and Sinn Fein. \n The Foyle MP 's latest intervention on behalf of the Provos throws the gauntlet down to the Government and shores up the republican argument that there will be no peace until dialogue is opened up with the terrorists. \n As the IRA mortars Heathrow Airport and murders innocent people on the streets of Northern Ireland, the SDLP and Sinn Fein leaders not surprisingly use a similar form of words to justify the Government parleying with the terrorists, instead of urging them to introduce measures to round them up and bring them to justice. \n Hume, maintaining the IRA was only firing blanks at Heathrow Airport, says the Government should launch new talks with Sinn Fein to exploit  \"the best opportunity in 20 years\"  for peace in Northern Ireland. Adams says the search for peace remains the  \"greatest challenge facing everyone\"  . \n Having schemed for a year on the best way of edging Northern Ireland out of the United Kingdom, the pair are now audaciously demanding that the IRA and Sinn Fein be allowed a central role in dialogue that will decide on a political solution here. \n The small matter of guns and explosives under the table while the Provos talk \"peace\" is of no consequence to the two men.Neither is the view of the unionist majority community in the Province whose citizenship would be gravely threatened if such a treacherous assembly line was set up. \n Not surprisingly, support for this line is coming from Labour 's Kevin McNamara, who believes that IRA/Sinn Fein have not yet totally rejected the Downing Street Declaration. But so far the Government has spurned the overtures, probably not out of conviction - more out of the realisation that such a move would trigger a dramatic deterioration in the climate in Northern Ireland leading eventually to a doomsday situation which would tragically engulf all the people of these islands. \n John Hume has significantly moved outside the parameters of the Downing Street Declaration with his demand for talks with the IRA before it calls a permanent cessation of violence and one can only assume that the long-term agenda he is now following for Northern Ireland is identical to the aspirations of those in the Provisional republican movement. The right of the unionist majority to remain British is certainly not part of the scenario he is hatching nor is it in the thinking of those he is finding common cause with these days. \n Northern Ireland is being pushed dangerously to the precipice by minority politicians whose form of Irish nationalism leaves little room for accommodation with the greater number of people who believe that their interests are best served in maintaining the Union. \n Dictating a political agenda at gunpoint can have no place in a proper democracy and, were the IRA and Sinn Fein to succeed in bombing the Government to the discussion table, it would herald a disastrous watershed in Anglo-Irish affairs. \n The Government has got to urgently arrest the situation by making it crystal clear that those engaged in terrorist violence will have no place in any dialogue on the future administration of Northern Ireland, unless they totally renounce violence and surrender their arms, ammunition and explosives. \n It must also move on to involve in discussions those parties who believe a meaningful form of government can be created within the constitutional confines of Northern Ireland. \n\n\n<$E>\n  Evil obscenities  \n Former Presbyterian Moderator Dr John Dunlop has quite properly castigated the perverse ideology that revels in the terrorist  \"spectacular\"  and accepts the legitimacy of  \"production line\"  killings. \n Dr Dunlop, speaking at the funeral service for murdered RUC officer Jackie Haggan yesterday, said the people who engaged in such activities were not into  \"the politics of persuasion\"  but were involved in  \"naked coercion\"  . \n The Churchmen 's words struck a chord for many in our divided community who have been caught up in the evil of terrorism:  \"Violence can have a corrosive effect upon those engaged in it and upon those who suffer the consequences. No matter how often these murders take place, we must try not to allow ourselves to accept them as normal, become insensitive to their effects or be destroyed by them\".  \n\n\n<$F>\n  EDITORIAL  \n Congratulations on your entry to Queen 's you belong to the few of us lucky enough to gain a place at university. I doubt if it was easy, though. When the A-level grades were released, school leavers throughout the country were thrust into the dog eat dog world of confusion and uncertainty as the struggle began - often in vain - to ensure positions in tertiary level education, especially in universities across the water. \n Except for school leavers who met the required grades, telephone lines were humming under the insistent pressure of concerned prospective students contacting the various academic institutions and organisations to have strangers informing them of their future. \n The signs of the big squeeze on university places - so apparent this year - have been on the increase over the last few years, rising from 15 <*> per cent sign </*> in 1987 to 28 <*> per cent sign </*> in 1992. Obviously the government 's target figure of 33 <*> per cent sign </*> by the year 2000 is well on course, but are the universities ' facilities in line with government projections? Furthermore, is the government well prepared to finance the demands they have issued for third level education? \n University resources - whether they are based on library facilities, tutorial sizes or adequate accommodation have been increasingly strained over the past five years. Limitations have been swept aside as the push for more undergraduate places has not been countered with an increase in the government 's spending for education. In fact, John Patten, Minister for Education, has had the gall to reduce by 33 <*> per cent sign </*> the fees for arts and social science courses. Regardless of the fact that these faculties have the greatest percentage of undergraduates, the fees set by the government have been drastically cut. \n The fee per student originally stood at <*> pound sign </*> 1,850.00 - it is now <*> pound sign </*> 1,300. To rub salt into the wounds of each university - and subsequently each prospective undergraduate - John Patten announced his plan AFTER many universities had begun offering course places on the presumption that undergraduate numbers would rise as in previous years. \n Universities, as a result, have been forced to freeze arts course levels to remain in line with last year 's figures whilst attempting to attract students to degrees where fees haven't been slashed. It doesn't help matters much when the government claims that their objective is to attract more students to science and technology courses, away from \"less useful\" arts and social sciences courses. \n The consequences so far? A lot of students with arts-orientated A-levels who have missed the requirements by a point or two, discovered with dismay that they have to reapply next year - when the competition will be even greater. \n Mr Patten assures us that expansion should be possible again, but not until 1996 - hardly comforting for this year 's unsuccessful school leavers as they watch those lucky enough to gain places pass by, gown-clad with degrees in tow.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f8aae28c-38e7-4210-a1a5-467f5f3beffb", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.689629+00:00"}

No 21 gun salutes. Just another wedding on a cold December Saturday.  Does the marriage of Princess Anne in Crathie Church mark the start of a new era for British Royalty?   \n Who would have believed that the people in that Scottish church yesterday were also the stars of so many spectacularly dignified State occasions? \n For the Royal family, it is indeed a long, long way from the glittering splendour of St Paul's Cathedral or Westminster Abbey, to a cramped kirk in the north of Scotland. \n   If the mighty have not fallen, they are certainly humbled.   \n As the Queen watched yesterday 's short ceremony, she must surely have mused upon the recent fortunes, or rather misfortunes, of her children. \n So, too, must her sons, Andrew and Charles, as they listened to the words of their sister 's second betrothal. \n Where the Monarchy goes from here depends upon where it choses to take itself. It is not the media's probing nor the public's fault that things have got out of hand. \n   The actions of the Royals themselves are responsible for the change in the public 's perception of them and the very real threat to the future standing of the Monarchy itself.   \n From Andrew and Sarah Ferguson to Charles and Diana Spencer, too many ordinary frailties and failings have been exposed already. \n   The Emperors have not quite lost their clothes but they are in need of a good dry-clean.   \n That the Queen and her family are mere mortals like the rest of us was never so apparent as now. Things royal can never be the same again. \n\n\n<$B>\n Now is the moment to press ahead \n  JIM Molyneaux is set to give the Prime Minister a piece of his mind when the pair meet this week.  \n The Unionist leader is fed up to the teeth with the Government 's kid glove handling of the IRA and Sinn Fein. \n And his Democtratic Unionist colleague, Dr Ian Paisley - who is also demanding talks with the PM - feels likewise. \n Mr Major has no one but himself to blame if he is sent reeling from a Unionist backlash against the  \"special understanding\"  they have with his Government. \n He promised before Christmas that if the Provos kept shooting he would crack down hard on them. \n Well, we 're half way through March, the guns are still blazing away and the security situation still leaves a lot to be desired. \n Much plain speaking will be done at Downing Street in the coming days. \n Messrs Molyneaux and Paisley, will demand to know just what the British and Irish governments are playing at. \n They will rightly argue that, as London and Dublin dither, decent people on both sides of the religious divide are suffering at the hands of so-called loyalist and IRA paramilitaries. \n Even the double mortar attack on Heathrow airport failed to bring the security response necessary to stop it happening again. \n By all accounts the Provos and Sinn Fein have rejected the peace accord. \n   So now is the time to press ahead - on the security and political front.   \n Jim Molyneaux, Ian Paisley, John Hume and John Alderdice are not accountable to any armed factions. \n The politicians who are have no one to blame but themselves if a settlement is reached over their heads. \n And the sooner that comes about the better. \n\n\n<$C>\n Worse than animals \n  The behaviour of loyalist paramilitaries in interrogation centres is nothing short of disgusting.  \n They are reported to be behaving worse than animals during questioning by RUC detectives. \n Now the police are hitting back. \n They have shown they are prepared to bring them to court on indecency charges. \n Boasting of such repugnant behaviour while hiding behind the cloak of anonymity is one thing. \n   Having your name published after a court case is quite another.   \n\n\n<$D>\n Will Aras soon get a new tenant? \n AT a time when Ireland is facing a period of renewed uncertainty over the peace process, the entire island clearly needs as much long-term political stability as possible. \n Many people will therefore have been alarmed by speculation that President Mary Robinson may stand down when her term of office expires in 1997. \n By common consent, Mrs Robinson has been one of the most outstanding presidents in the history of the state. \n Her election four years ago may well have been an act of political serendipity, in that only a self-inflicted blow prevented Fianna Fail 's Brian Lenihan from securing the highest office in the land. \n However, having topped the polls against all the odds, Mrs Robinson immediately set out to re-define the position of the presidency in modern Ireland. \n She has succeeded in a way few could have predicted, and has helped to transform the image not only of her office but also of her country. \n Mrs Robinson has travelled to every corner of Ireland, and has proved a particularly welcome visitor on this side of the border. \n She has managed to establish a rapport with unionists which would have been almost unthinkable in the past, and also found the time to meet with Gerry Adams in west Belfast. \n In addition, northerners from a wide variety of backgrounds have accepted invitations to attend functions at her official residence in Phoenix Park. \n Mrs Robinson has also become a major figure on the world stage through her trips to Europe, the USA, Asia, Australia and most poignantly Somalia. \n In particular, her discussions with Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace were of huge symbolic importance. \n She will undoubtedly add to her long list of achievements before her term of office is completed. \n Were she to allow her name to go forward for re-election, the outcome of the poll would be a mere formality. \n Indeed, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael might well feel there would be little point in fielding a candidate against Mrs Robinson. \n The possibility that she might rule herself out of the race has not so far been widely considered. \n However, the fact is that Mrs Robinson has not yet committed herself to seeking a second seven-year spell at the Aras. \n Just days ago, one of the USA 's most influential newspapers, the Boston-Globe, suggested that the president was a strong contender to emerge as the next Secretary General of the United Nations. \n The outgoing Secretary General, Boutros Boutros Ghali, who is due to retire in 1996, had lengthy private talks with Mrs Robinson only last week. \n Some sources have also suggested that the president could be in line for a seat at either the European Court of Justice in Strasbourg or the World Court in the Hague. \n She may even feel she has had enough of the limelight, and want to spend more time with her family at their new home in Co Mayo. \n Mrs Robinson is her own woman and must make up her own mind, but the simple truth is that Ireland needs her in the Phoenix Park. \n She had accomplished much, but much still needs to be done. A second term would allow her a unique opportunity to review and develop the constitutional role of the presidency. \n  Her continued presence at the head of the state would also reassure unionists during what still seems likely to be a crucial period in the history of the island. \n For these and many other reasons, Mary Robinson must be the president to lead Ireland into the 21st century. \n\n\n<$E>\n Unsporting thought of a petty mind \n The news that Unionist MP John Taylor is delighted, for petty political reasons, when Ireland lose international rugby matches is most illuminating. \n In the first place, the expression on his face when the Irish gained their famous victory over England at Twickenham last month would have been priceless. \n Indeed, had the boys in green been aware of their ability to annoy Mr Taylor simply by winning matches, the Triple Crown, Five Nations Championship and Grand Slam would no doubt already be in the bag. \n On a more serious note, the Strangford MP 's views are an insult to the many Ulster Protestants - including RUC members - who have represented Ireland with such distinction over the years. \n Almost every major sport, with the obvious exception of soccer, is organised on an all-Ireland basis. \n Friendships made on the field of play frequently cut across political and religious barriers in a way which Mr Taylor - whose first sporting love is Glasgow Rangers FC - clearly cannot comprehend. \n It may not be long before he issues a statement complaining about the fact that Ireland play on a green pitch. \n\n\n<$F>\n Airport delays mean more than murders \n THE IRA has, according to the evidence of the past few days, adapted the nation of talking peace and carrying a big stick. \n Three attacks on Heathrow Airport, the possibility of further 'spectaculars' and now the sweet-sounding statement about peace show that the Provisionals are just as capable as anyone else of looking in two directions at the same time. \n The Heathrow attacks were not just designed to hit the headlines. The fact that three were launched on such a sensitive target served to embarrass the British security forces. The IRA seemed to send a mocking signal with the fact that none of the mortars exploded. The next time things could be different. \n It proved total security is a myth and that the IRA retains the abiltity to strike a range of targets. It also served to make ordinary members of the British public feel threatened by the IRA's bombing capacity. \n Before, it was the City of London and the London Underground. Now, it is London's main airport. Even Queen Elizabeth is threatened. She landed at Heathrow during one of the alerts. \n For many ordinary British people, the bombers of the IRA must seem to be everywhere. This, in turn, will filter through the British political system and increase pressure on the establishment to divert from its present course. \n As always, the fact that lives have been lost in Northern Ireland during the airport bombings has been all but ignored. Delayed planes at Heathrow mean more than dead police officers or civilians across the Irish Sea. \n Last night's underlining of the republican movement 's proclaimed dedication to peace must be seen in the context of the violence of recent days and it demands a response. \n In an interview given to this newspaper by Taoiseach Albert Reynolds, the IRA has its answer. The declaration signed in Downing Street should be enough to enable an immediate cessation of violence. \n Then, and only then, can initial contacts with other parties and the Irish government be made through a Forum For Peace And Reconciliation which will pave the way to full inter-party talks and negotiations with the British. \n Mr Reynolds and Mr John Major have declared their commitment to the declaration and the process it initiates in such a way that backing down is not on the agenda. The IRA should recognise that. \n It should be made clear that participants in future talks do not, as the taoiseach makes clear in the Irish News today, need to endorse every syllable of the Downing Street document. \n But what they should be in no doubt about is the fact that since December 15 and the agreeing of the declaration, both governments have gone further than either - and especially the British - has done to date. It is unlikely that more significant movement is likely. \n The Provisionals are great believers in the 'one last push' theory of violence. \n To believe that now would be a deadly mistake which will be measured only by the size of Northern Ireland 's death toll. \n If that theory held any water, why have centuries of conflict and, more recently, 25 years of vicious violence not delivered Utopia? \n The two premiers have stressed their belief that the airport bombers and all the rest of them are tragically mistaken if they think that another London blitz will change the status quo. \n Progress will come but only via constitutional politics.

{"text": "<Ulster editorials 3>\n\n\n<$A>\n  Scrap the play-offs to avoid chaos  \n YESTERDAY marked the final round of matches in the divisional section of the GAA's second most important competition. \n However, it will be another couple of months before the destination of the 1994 National League title is decided. \n A bewildering series of play-off and preliminary play-off games now gets under way, with Ulster counties, as usual, to the fore. \n All Ireland champions Derry, despite suffering their first defeat in almost a year, are already through to the quarter finals, where they will be joined by a resurgent Armagh and, possibly, by both Down and Donegal. \n The only certainty at this stage is that, before the Church <*> ampersand </*> General trophy is handed over, the GAA is in for another period of inter-county fixture chaos. \n The backlog of games will complicate preparations for one of the most eagerly awaited Ulster Championship on record, and is bound to result in the indefinite postponement of club matches all over the province. \n Despite any short-term loss of revenue, the time has surely come to scrap the play-offs, and allow the winners of an enlarged Division One to be declared as national league champions. \n\n\n<$B>\n  Irish rainbow  \n  WHOEVER emerges as Taoiseach from a mould-breaking election in the Republic, Dick Spring is the obvious winner and Albert Reynolds the loser. For a major party to double its representation, as Labour appears to have done, is a spectacular success - making Fianna Fail 's failure to win an overall majority all the more humiliating. Mr Reynolds ' only consolation is that the main Opposition party, Fine Gael, fared even worse, signalling that the days of one-party government in the Republic may have gone for good. The electorate may    have finally   turned away from old-style Civil War politics, dominated by Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, in favour of rainbow coalitions covering the spectrum from Left to Right. \n Mr Reynolds paid the penalty for calling an election no one wanted, at a time and on grounds that no other Taoiseach would have chosen. His association with the economic recession - and, coincidentally, with obscure wording on the substantive abortion referendum - encouraged a protest vote against the government, which Labour was able to capitalise upon. A public which has seen its standard of living eroded, and which is suffering record unemployment, gladly seized on Labour 's high-spending promises, even though it may have voted more in hope than expectation. The PDs were seemingly unaffected by their unhappy term in the coalition government - probably because Des O'Malley was regarded as a victim of Fianna Fail chicanery - and Fine Gael seem unable to produce a credible leader. \n Now begins the difficult business of building a government from the indecision of the election result. Fianna Fail are still unchallenged as the largest party, but their only hope of retaining power is in coalition - almost certainly under a new leader. While almost any combination is possible, the politicians can hardly ignore the electorate 's clear desire for change. Mr Spring might prefer to avoid the difficult economic decisions which will be necessary, in order to build on his popularity, but he is almost obliged to play his part in government, so overwhelming was his mandate. The problem for the next Taoiseach, of whatever colour, will be to convince the country - and the world at large - that his government has the stability to weather future economic and political storms. As far as Northern Ireland is concerned, any government which can show more sensitivity towards the unionist position - which excludes the present Fianna Fail leadership - would be an improvement. \n\n\n<$C>\n  Open season  \n THE Home Secretary's announcement that Sunday trading laws will not be enforced in the run-up to Christmas is surprising in pure legal terms, but is a pragmatic recognition of the fundamental problems arising from existing legislation. Court action on alleged breaches of the Shop Act have been suspended until the European Court of Justice rules on its validity. Eventually MPs are to be allowed a free vote on three options which will reform the law - total deregulation; partial deregulation allowing small shops to open all hours and limited opening for large stores; and a ban on Sunday opening except for specified outlets. \n The second option seems the fairest, offering a compromise solution. Public opinion would appear to favour more widespread Sunday opening, but it is right that there should be some recognition of the special position of the Sabbath. It is also welcome that any new legislation on opening will contain protection for staff, allowing those with strong Sabbatarian views to opt not to work on that day without prejudicing their position. \n Drafting a suitable compromise bill which can be enforced may be a delicate task, but should be proceeded with as soon as practicable. \n\n\n<$D>\n  Royal dues  \n The Queen 's voluntary agreement to pay tax on her private income and to prune the Civil List is a welcome and sagacious move. At a stroke she has defused much of the public criticism of the privilege accorded to the Royal Family. She has conceded the principle that the House of Windsor should be treated in fiscal matters in the same manner as her subjects. That, and agreeing to meet the expenses of all but the most senior Royals from her own pocket, will pay a long term dividend in helping to restore the affection of the nation which, to some extent, has been undermined by the behaviour of the younger members of her family. The State will still pay a large part of the cost, but that is a bill which now will be borne more readily by the taxpayer. The whole issue has not been handled well by the Government, which recently indicated that taxation of the Monarch was unlikely. That only served to inflame public opinion. \n\n\n<$E>\n  VIEWPOINT  \n  Plugging loopholes  \n  IRISH JUSTICE:   New extradition machinery must be made to work  \n THERE is no more depressing sight, for anyone hopeful of better relations between Northern Ireland and the Republic, than that of IRA or INLA murder suspects walking free from Dublin courts. It happened again yesterday, when extradition proceedings failed against an Armagh man, wanted in connection with the murder of an army careers officer in Derby two years ago. \n No evidence was offered, for the simple reason that last month an attempt to extradite another Armagh man, also an INLA suspect, came to nothing. The judge then held that the murder of the Army sergeant was  \"political\"  - and in any case there could not be a fair trial because of prejudicial newspaper publicity. \n The Irish state has been saved some legal expenses, but at what a cost to confidence in its ability to deal seriously with the threat of terrorism in another European Union member state. Until new legislation, closing the massive loopholes in the present extradition law, is in place, even those who carried out the mortar attacks on Heathrow would presumably be protected. The law will not be retrospective. \n The UK has been too tolerant, for too long, of the interminable delays in tightening extradition arrangements. There was an attempt to address the problem as long ago as 1973, in Sunningdale, but substitute measures like extra-territorial courts, where suspects can be tried in the Republic for offences committed in the UK, are generally unsatisfactory. \n In the past, technical mistakes were made by the British authorities in extradition warrants, which resulted in several failures. This has largely been overcome, but the problem is that the Irish adopted the European Convention on Terrorism - despite warnings - and now have to amend it to eliminate the plea of a \"political\" motive. \n The fear must be that even when the law is changed, it will still be possible for the defence to argue that adverse media publicity has ruled out a fair trial. The media must be encouraged to exercise more restraint, but it is impossible to avoid speculation when attacks which kill or endanger hundreds of lives occur. Just because of past events, the Irish judiciary should not assume that terrorist suspects will not get a fair hearing. Otherwise the extradition machinery now being put in place will be a sham, and Anglo-Irish cooperation seen as a one-sided exercise. \n\n\n<$F>\n  In camera?  \n  POLICE VIDEOS:   Recording of interrogations could protect both sides  \n THE call for video and sound recording of interviews with terrorist suspects is the most controversial proposal in Sir Louis Blom-Cooper 's first report. In the view of the Independent Commissioner for Holding Centres recordings would end prisoners ' claims of mistreatment during interrogation. \n He also argues that it would speed up trials as a significant number of cases hinge on claims about what did or did not happen during police questioning. It is a persuasive argument, although the proposal is strongly opposed by the RUC. \n The police contend that recordings would be ineffective. A suspect could claim that alleged ill-treatment took place out of camera shot or range of the sound recording equipment. More worryingly, the Chief Constable argues that recording of interviews would inhibit the flow of information. \n Suspects in police custody are often questioned about a whole range of matters, not just a single incident. Sometimes information can be obtained which does not relate directly to the person detention was recorded such information might be forthcoming. \n Sir Louis's recommendations suggest a way around this problem. The tapes would be held by a senior police officer and would only be disclosed in very limited circumstances. It should be possible to find a compromise which would satisfy both sides. \n One suggestion is that a judge, sitting in chambers, could decide on the relevant parts of recordings which would be used as evidence in court if the need arose.<#>\nThat would protect the source of information and also the police from charges of\nill-treatment.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "0902c446-2b90-402d-9886-47b7f15a0cce", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.692220+00:00"}
{"text": "<Mixed Ulster editorials>\n\n\n<$A>\n  Balancing act  \n EVEN before the Republic's new coalition government was finalised, Sir Patrick Mayhew was offering some pointed advice on Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish constitution. They were regarded as  \"an unhelpful territorial claim\"  to part of the UK and would be a central ingredient, he said, in discussions about a resumption of political talks in Northern Ireland. \n His remarks confirm that Articles 2 and 3 were the main stumbling block to agreement. The Unionists wanted an assurance that a referendum \"would\" be held in the event of agreement being reached on new structures, but Dublin would only say that it \"could\". \n Sir Patrick was lending weight to the unionist case, providing a necessary counter-balance to his sympathetic appraisal of the nationalist tradition in his Coleraine speech before Christmas. \n Anyone who thought he was  \"going soft\"  by suggesting that Sinn Fein could qualify for early inclusion of the talks now knows the true position: there would have to be a  \"sufficient period\"  after renunciation of violence before dialogue with the authorities would be possible. \n The message to the new government in Dublin is equally clear. If there is no change on Articles 2 and 3, which confer a \"constitutional imperative\" on governments to pursue Irish unity, further talks are pointless. \n It remains to be seen how serious the new coalition administration is in facing up to the Northern Ireland problem. The agreed document between Fianna Fail and Labour only promised a referendum for any  \"agreed package\" , emphasising a \"balanced accommodation\" and avoiding all mention of the disputed articles. \n The hope must be that, since it was Mr Dick Spring who broke ranks last year by proposing a suspension of Anglo-Irish conferences, his moderating influence will soon be felt. With more boldness, progress could be made but that is an unlikely prospect. \n Although Mr Reynolds has been more realistic than his predecessors, neither he nor Mr Spring will want to risk coalition solidarity over the North, at least until after Ulster 's local government elections in May. For them, there are far more pressing economic problems to resolve. Here, unfortunately, the parties are starting to dig their trenches already. \n\n\n<$B>\n  Sectarian fires  \n THE recent spate of arson attacks on Catholic and Protestant churches and Orange Halls epitomises the sick sectarian undercurrent present in this province. It is a low-life form of ethnic cleansing, striking at the religious affiliations and cultural traditions of the opposing community. \n The material cost of the fire-raising is substantial. Scores of buildings have been attacked. In some instances they have been so badly damaged that they can never be restored to their former state. Part of our heritage is being put to the torch. \n There is a more insidious cost. The attacks raise the level of mistrust and suspicion among neighbours and heighten community tension. They add fuel to an already explosive mix. Saddest of all, these irreligious acts are often carried out in the name of religion. \n There is one saving grace. Frequently the outrages lead to a true Christian response in affected communities. Clergy and laity cross the divide to offer support, both spoken and financial, to those who have been attacked. They recognise that it is a battle of good against evil. \n A most fundamental civil right is under attack in both communities. The arsonists are the enemy of all. They defend no cause but attack our freedoms. There is only one place for them. Behind bars. \n\n\n<$C>\n  Life savers  \n CHEAP they may be, but smoke alarms have proved their worth as life-saving devices. At least 145 people escaped uninjured from house blazes here last year after being alerted by the warning sirens. The number of fatalities fell to 15, almost half the previous year's total. \n As advertisements show, fires take hold with frightening rapidity and it is essential that householders are given the earliest possible warning of any outbreak. Strategically sited alarms are the best safeguard and every home should have at least one. \n The devices are inexpensive. Special schemes are available to install them free of charge for people like pensioners. Get one now. It could save your life. \n\n\n<$D>\n  Critical list  \n THE consultation process continues, but the future of hospital reorganisation in the Eastern Board area is much clearer from today. The Belfast Telegraph 's exclusive revelations on the future purchasing plans of the board provide the fullest picture yet of how the existing hospitals will expand or contract in the years to come. \n A previous consultation document set out the Board 's criteria for evaluating hospital services, from which hospitals like Downe concluded that they would lose patients. Now they know the worst, and it appears that the biggest losers are the Royal, City and Downe hospitals, while the Mater, Lagan Valley and Ulster hospitals all attain a higher status. \n The Board 's reasoning is that since it becomes a purchaser of services from April 1, it must spend its money where the population will get the maximum benefit. As it has lost out financially, because of changes in funding, it would say there is no alternative to rationalisation of expensive services, while not wanting patients to have to travel too far. \n The result is that the Board will be relying less on the Royal and City and more on outlying hospitals like the Lagan Valley in Lisburn and Ulster in Dundonald, which are easily accessible to people who have moved out of Belfast. It will be up to the two Belfast-based hospitals, which will get self-governing trust status from April, to consider how best they will meet this challenge. Less duplication and perhaps and eventual merger may be on the cards, but their teaching hospital status must be preserved. \n There is no easy answer to the problems facing the hospital service, as medical technology develops new means of treatment at the same time as patients ' expectations grow and funding, in real terms, declines. The Eastern Board is about to put its proposals on the table, which must be anathema for those hospitals and communities which see their services down-graded. \n The protests will continue, and adjustments may still be possible. But the Government 's reform laid down the ground rules, with their concept of a free market in medicine, and it will be difficult to upset them. \n\n\n<$E>\n  Killing stakes  \n A year ago this week-end eight Protestant workmen were murdered by the IRA who blew up their minibus at Teebane. It was a sickening atrocity which shocked the province. But it was also a signal for an upsurge in sectarian violence. \n Today we are still reaping the whirlwind of Teebane. Last night a Catholic man was shot dead by loyalists and a Protestant seriously wounded by republicans. The murder of the workmen unleashed the dogs of war. \n The loyalist counter violence - including two multiple murder attacks on bookmakers ' shops in Belfast - demonstrated the new ruthlessness and chilling effectiveness of the restructured UFF and UVF. They have demonstrated their willingness and capacity to equal, indeed outpace, the IRA in the killing stakes. \n Terrorists of whatever hue now know their actions will be answered in kind. Their continued campaigns show that they no longer pretend to de defenders of their respective communities. By their actions they bring only retaliation onto their own streets. \n What can be done to counter the violence? Part of the answer is for the ordinary people to unite against the terrorists. Two women - one Catholic, one Protestant - widowed in Tyrone last week later met to share their grief. They showed they feel the same anguish. Murder is murder, no matter who perpetrates it. \n\n\n<$F>\n  Home promotion  \n THE visit of a 40-strong EC team to Londonderry today shows the value of determined self promotion. John Hume has influential contacts in Europe and America and uses them to show to a wider audience the problems facing his native city. \n If there is a criticism, it would be that Mr Hume, as a MEP for the whole province, should have drawn up a wider itinerary for his visitors. Doubtless, though, he would argue that the difficulties of Derry are more acute than in other areas and the self-help initiatives employed to tackle them more innovative. \n The exercise demonstrates the need for Ulster 's politicians to take a more positive international role. Belfast MPs, Cecil Walker and Joe Hendron, proved on their recent visit to America that there are jobs and investment to be found abroad. \n Belfast, whose image has been ill-served by some of its councillors in recent times, is also to engage in a big jobs and tourism promotion, costing <*> pound sign </*> 5m over the next five years. Perhaps more of our politicians are now learning that economic revival is more important than bickering over issues which they cannot influence. \n\n\n<$G>\n political column \n  Summit of aspirations  \n  Emily O'Reilly  \n  The taoiseach has set the deadline. By nightfall on December 3rd - or whatever day his summit in Dublin with the British prime minister takes place - we shall know whether the \"possibility of peace\" is a reality.  \n Throughout Leinster House, politicians are holding their breath. Either Albert Reynolds is naive or, in his 35-minute, completely private meeting with John Major on the margins of the October Brussels summit, he found out something about British government intent to which no one else is privy. \n The northern secretary is resisting the notion of deadlines. He is also resisting the belief of the government in Dublin that any round of talks in the old, 'three-strand' process would be largely futile without a prior cessation of violence. \n Sir Patrick Mayhew wants the talks to begin anyway. If peace flows from that, well and good, he believes. If not, they may still yield other benefits. \n The difference is not one of tactics, or even emphasis. When Mr Reynolds speaks of a cessation of violence, he is speaking in the first instance of a cessation of IRA violence. And he knows that persuasion alone will not win that. \n To get the IRA to stop, it must be given something. And it is that 'something' the British are resisting, through their insistence that a cessation of violence should not be the main priority. \n The taoiseach has already ruled out a British declaration of intent to withdraw by a certain date. He knows it 's not on, and he knows that such a declaration would further inflame a murderously sensitive situation. \n His government does, however, want the British to make a declaration. What this is it will not spell out in public but, at the very least, it wants the British to get off the neutral fence and become proactive in the drive for a solution. \n If the British remain neutral, the republic's government fears that the <italic> status quo  will remain, that the talks will end up in the same cul-de-sac as before - and that violence on both sides will increase. \n Dick Spring 's six principles do not, according to the Sinn F&/ein president, Gerry Adams, address the fundamentals of the Hume-Adams plan. They do not contain a mechanism by which the unionists could be compelled to look for a solution outside the narrow framework of an internal settlement. \n Yet it is clear from government sources in Dublin that the taoiseach and the t&/anaiste realise that just such a dynamic must be part of any new framework for progress worked out by both government. \n One possibility is contained in a draft document from the republic 's side, leaked to me last month. This talks of a  \"reciprocal endorsement\"  of the constitutional positions of both governments, in which the republic would reaffirm its commitment to the no-change-without-consent principle on the north. In that context, it suggests, the British would  \"acknowledge the full legitimacy and value of the goal of Irish unity by consent, cherished by the greater number of people living in Ireland, and the consequential need for practical provisions to give that objective equally meaningful operational expression and opportunity, including in any future structures within Northern Ireland and between North and South\"  . \n In public at least, there is no sign that the British want to play ball, despite Mr Major 's honeyed words in the Guildhall. While welcome, from Dublin 's point of view, in tone and emphasis - plus the deliberate use of language similar to that of Mr Reynolds and Mr Spring - the speech contained nothing new. \n Privately, British officials say that their government is not about to join the ranks of the 'persuaders'. This implies that it is content to remain neutral, focus exclusively on the talks process and hope for the best. \n But if John Hume has done nothing else, he has at least convinced the republic 's government that the talks process is insufficient on its own, and that only a separate, British-backed initiative can break the logjam. \n To date, Dublin 's strategy has been to sweet-talk the British and the unionists and risk short-term nationalist alienation for the sake of longer-term nationalist gain. The assurances to the unionists, topped up with a stated willingness to neuter articles 2 and 3, should, they hope, put pressure on the British to reciprocate.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "5a799817-8a59-4416-b9f5-4bebc90d6a3f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.693042+00:00"}
{"text": "<Fortnight editorials>\n\n\n<$A>\n  leader  \n  Ideology 's human cost  \n  Robin Wilson  \n   \"Everybody has had enough.\"   Those four words from the wife and mother of two of those injured in the Shankill IRA atrocity ought to have  been  enough to staunch the bloodshed. Yet they were not:    loyalists   were already well on the way to evening the 'score' after we went to press. \n Last month we warned that the Hume-Adams agreement would only serve to  \"reinforce the adversarial political culture on which the War Process subsists\".  And so, with relentless inevitability, it did. \n The Ulster Unionist leader, James Molyneaux, who sees himself as government kingmaker courtesy of his 'understanding' with John Major, described John Hume as his  \"greatest ally\"  in cementing that relationship - reciprocated in the prime minister 's conference approbation of the \"Conservative and Unionist party\". \n But there was, of course, far worse. It was as sure as night follows day that loyalists would up the ante. Some 30 attacks followed in as many days - with unionists, slavering about a 'pan-nationalist front' in front of every microphone, effectively egging them on. \n It was utterly predictable, too, that the IRA - incredibly not required to make a single concession for the new legitimacy attaching to its political wing - would 'negotiate from strength' with further bombs, and would in turn up the stakes with the loyalist hit squads. 'Regrettable', though, as Gerry Adams put it, the collateral damage of those ten massacred at the fishmonger 's. \n But why should Mr Adams be contrite? He had outmanoeuvred Mr Hume, and was perfectly placed to claim the onus was now on the British government, not the IRA, to respond to their 'peace plan'.A plan about which the IRA army council, the US administration and Nelson Mandela have been briefed, but which cannot be revealed to the D&/ail - never mind the long-suffering populace of the north. \n Unlike SDLP members. Sinn F&/ein activists have been told the substance of the discussions. As Ed Maloney reported in the  Sunday Tribune ,  \"Activists are being told that Sinn F&/ein could make substantial gains through what the party 's leaders see as the potential of the Hume-Adams agreement to bring the SDLP and Dublin government closer to Sinn F&/ein on the terms for a northern settlement.\"  They were not, he said, being prepared for any concession. \n Mr Adams has now secured the unprecedented principle that a cessation of IRA - and all other - violence is not an immediate moral imperative, but must attend upon a political pay-off acceptable to the army council. \n As Stephen Collins commented in the  Sunday Press  last month,  \"The fact that things have gone so far in the direction of a common nationalist front involving Sinn F&/ein while the IRA campaign continues is something that would have been unthinkable even a year ago and it marks a huge sea change in Irish politics ... Despite some deep-seated reservations the government has gone along with the strategy to date and it may well be too late to get out.\"  \n Ministers were rocked on their heels by Mr Adams ' remark, echoed by the IRA, that peace was not a \"prerequisite\" of the ... peace process! After the Shankill bomb, the t&/anaiste, Dick Spring, said that 'process' had been dealt a  \"grievous blow\".  \n Yet Mr Adams ' response to the t&/anaiste 's comments suggested that he was the government, the latter a mere bystander. He slapped him down thus:  \"Mr Spring has to allow me to be the best judge of how I move forward\".  \n It is an appalling catalogue of error. There must now be an end to what Dick Walsh of the  Irish Times  called  \"fooling around with words\".  Engaging in an airy disquisition about 'Irish self-determination' while claiming simultaneously to be seeking unionist 'agreement' is self-delusion: ever heard of anyone supporting 'self-determination' who wanted to remain inside a state? The inevitable unionist riposte was that  they  had the right of 'self-determination', to secede from the rest of the island. We 've had that argument for a century and, while the slaughter continues, we can go round that circle for ever. \n There has been much facile comparison of Northern Ireland with the middle east and South Africa - mindless of the fact that these two conflicts were prisoners of the cold war, whose demise made the breakthrough possible. Last month, Padraig O'Malley of the Opsahl Commission, who has closely studied South Africa, drew the real parallel: the relative 'manageability' of the Northern Ireland conflict, the argued, meant there was not the same pressure on politicians to compromise. It may, he gloomily concluded, have to get a lot worse before it gets better. \n The two government must now recapture the initiative. They must elaborate positive proposals that can command acceptance across Northern Ireland. People are crying out for the  \"vision of hope\"  called for by Archbishop Eames. The 'realities' identified by the Opsahl report, based on a widespread survey of opinion, offer a ready-made framework. \n If they do not, that human appeal of the Shankill relative will be in vain. \n\n\n<$A>\n  leader  \n  Popular power  \n  Robin Wilson  \n  The pieces inside by Adrian Guelke (p12) and (in the supplement) Eamonn Gallagher should make arresting reading for any complacent minister or official in London or Dublin  . Can any  still  be complacent after the miasma into which the 'peace process' collapsed last month? \n In giving the Downing Street Declaration a fair wind (  Fortnight 324  ), we suppressed our doubts about the way it hinged on the notion of 'self-determination' (  Fortnight 321  ). Yet it is now evident that what Mr Gallagher calls the  'paradigm of conflicting self-determinations'  , which has been at the heart of attempts to achieve a settlement since direct rule, is fundamentally flawed. \n As the former Opsahl commissioner argues,  \"While academic research during the past 20 years or so has concentrated on the problem as principally an internal conflict largely confined to Northern Ireland but with external ramifications, politics has concentrated on the self-determination paradigm - with, and perhaps for that reason, limited success.\"  \n Prof Guelke, having written on international dimensions of the conflict as well as on his native South Africa, is similarly well placed to comment. Making self-determination hinge on whether nationalists or unionists hold a majority, he points out, is not only not new; it does not offer a formula for breaking down the sectarian divide. Instead, it risks \"placing a political premium on the maintenance of community solidarity and offering no incentives for cross-community co-operation\". \n Last month 's messy exchanges between Sinn F&/ein, the two governments and sundry other players entirely missed the point - which is not whether the declaration is 'clarified' or not. Paradoxically, to 'clarify' it for Sinn F&/ein, to make it more akin to Hume-Adams, would entail making key elements  less  clear - particularly the majority-consent principle and the neutrality of the British, both of which would be qualified into an implied long-term withdrawal formula. \n So are we inevitably destined to spend weeks, months, years more 'Waiting for Provo'? There is now no doubt that the republican movement will not accept the declaration as it stands, and equally none that the 'clarification' Gerry Adams has sought would see crucial liberal Protestant support (see p14) disappear like snow off a ditch. \n But there is another way. Republicans have tentatively indicated that what  could  be acceptable is a clear and incontrovertible commitment by the British government on foot of the declaration to introduce a series of measures which would  \"empower the nationalist community\" . \n They frankly admit that the rank-and-file republican view of the declaration is that it has nothing to offer. They point to the disillusioning experience of the first hunger strike, when a vague and general document produced by the British did not lead to the expected concrete steps (until after the next one). And they are convinced that, even were the IRA to accept the declaration as it stands, another IRA would take its place. \n But what if, as was suggested in  Fortnight 323 , the British government was to commit itself - and, where possible, rapidly introduce - a raft of measures which secured the 'empowerment' of nationalists (without disempowering unionists) which the Opsahl Commission held out? A promise that any new political institutions would entrench equality, not just majoritarian power-sharing; a pledge to give legal recognition of nationalism so that Northern Ireland no longer enshrined unionist cultural dominance; new north-south structures so that relationship on the island were between Irish men and women alone; a bill of right and repeal of 'emergency legislation'; phased withdrawal of the army, initially to barracks; a fundamental review of policing, to establishing a service which no longer entailed the majority policing the minority; a programme of social and economic reconstruction for ghetto areas; phased release and reintegration of paramilitary prisoners; and so on. \n This would give republican leaders something to 'sell' as a rationale for a purely peaceful politics, would indicate the  bona fides  of the British state and would clearly help, rather than hinder, the long-term goal of unification by consent. \n None of these principles need prejudice renewed interparty talks. Indeed, the latter frankly have no chance of success unless such a clear framework is established for them. For by ending the ludicrous separation between 'peace' and 'talks' - not to mention the latter's baroque 'three strands' division - we could then get on to the business of fleshing out the cross-sectarian consensus that Opsahl sketched and to which Prof. Guelke alludes. \n The big question, as ever though, is this: would the  British government  be prepared, given the Conservatives ' implacable hostility to root-and-branch reform of the British constitution, to entertain such a radical rethink, to make a settlement possible in Northern Ireland? \n\n\n<$A>\n  The final phase  \n  Robin Wilson  \n  Last month, most of the political class in these islands was still asking the wrong question. 'Will the republican movement accept the joint declaration?' was answered in December (  Fortnight 324  ). The real question is  'Can IRA (and other) violence be brought to an end?'  The answer to that could now be yes. \n The  Economist  rightly attacked both government last month for their lack of forethought at the time of the declaration as to what they would do if the IRA did not accept it. Subsequent inertia in London has let Sinn F&/ein roll forward off its heels with the endless, synthetic calls for  British  'clarification' - as if a 16-page document from an  Irish  government wasn't good enough! Last month, that inertia entailed an unbelievably stupid defence of the Prevention of Terrorism Act - as if to validate those defiant IRA mortars at Heathrow - in continued contravention of the European Convention of Human Rights. \n Yet Dublin has also encouraged northern nationalist immobilism, echoing the Hume-Adams rejection of an 'internal settlement' - when, as the Social Democratic and Labour leader himself surely appreciates, the very dichotomy of 'internal'  versus 'external' pertains to a period of absolute 'national sovereignty' obsolete in the modern Europe. The genius of the Opsahl report was to address 'internally' - via legal recognition of northern nationalism and other innovations - aspirations it was traditionally conceived could only be met by 'external' means. \n In the light of the defeat of the 'liberal' Chris McGimpsey at the Ulster Unionist agm and the histrionics by the Democratic Unionist leader, the Rev Ian Paisley, in Downing Street, the  Economist  was also right to conclude:  \"Northern Ireland 's politicians cannot, and probably will never be able to, formulate among themselves ... a settlement.\"  But it continued:  \"Nevertheless, polls show that a vast majority of people in Northern Ireland are fed up with the province 's [sic] political stalemate as well as the convoluted rationale given by the IRA for its violent campaign ... The two governments must now exploit this desire for a settlement, and the growing anger at the IRA, by proposing how peace, and justice, in Northern Ireland can be achieved.\" \n Just so (  Fortnight 326  ). Start with the right question. And the initial answer is that  already  IRA violence has been constrained, by such evidence of popular anger as the recent north-south poll for BBC 's  On the Record.  Civilian casualties are now out, as are huge bombs in Protestant towns. \n Result? Only two IRA victims this year, as we went to press. That 's no consolation to the five Catholics slayed by sectarian assassins, but even that killing rate, horrendous though it is, is down on the last two years of bloody loyalism. No one has been killed by the police or army since November 1992. \n The republican leadership is also hoist by its own petard. As after Heathrow, every act of IRA violence now only devalues Mr Adams ' peace-loving credentials. The web of three governments SF drew around itself, party  via  Mr Hume, is falling apart - as impatience grows not only in London but in Dublin and Washington, and is no longer even concealed by Mr Hume 's party colleagues. \n The  Andersonstown News  could not be further, in class or national terms, from the aloof assuredness of the  Economist.  But last month it set out a fuller answer to the (right) question:  \"It surprises us that usually sane people should thing that, after 20 years of armed conflict and thousands of deaths, the situation could be rectified without a fundamental and radical change in society.\"  \n And it went on, echoing Opsahl:  \"No matter about the nitty gritty of constitutional change or the argument about self-determination, the ethos of the state here has to change to accommodate the identity and outlook of all its citizens.\" \n It 's an argument compellingly made inside by the leader of SF on Belfast City Council, Alex Maskey (p28), in a demand for real parity of esteem. In this state, such liberalism and pluralism  would be   'fundamental and radical change'.  \n It 's been the role of  this  leader column in recent months to point the way through the impasse by highlighting this legitimate republican demand for empowerment of the northern minority, as against perpetuating in intractable 'argument about self-determination'. \n In last month 's Lords debate on Opsahl, the former Northern Ireland secretary Lord Rees said:  \"The report is a remarkable document ... It influence and should influence the steps that are to be taken.\"  Its beauty is that, should IRA (and other) violence become increasingly perfunctory, it provides steps - such as a bill or charter of rights - which republicans can welcome to ease them out of the political ghetto into a wider  realpolitik,  yet which liberals and pluralists can endorse as a necessary substratum of new institutions. \n And, just as importantly, its overall recommendations - supported by a 'vast majority' in the subsequent poll as they were - provide a basis on which the two governments can establish just how 'peace, and justice' are to be secured.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "463c5f7c-0584-477e-8799-af912d7dabf3", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.694274+00:00"}
{"text": "<Coalition - Conscience>\n\n\n<$A>\n  STRIKING BACK AGAINST THE REYNOLDS ' FACTOR  \n  F.F. in disarray as 'Rainbow' looms.  \n  YOU should never underestimate the ability of politicians to cock things up. Last week, I said that unless something extraordinary happened, we would have a Fianna F&/ail/Labour Party Government, with Mr. Bertie Ahern as Taoiseach.  \n Well, something extraordinary did happen and we have been living with the consequences since. We learned that the Taoiseach, Mr. Albert Reynolds, and his Fianna F&/ail Ministers were fully aware of the importance of the Duggan case on the Monday before the government fell, and that they kept this information from the D&/ail and from their Labour partners in government. \n CONFIRMATION that they knew was forthcoming from the new Attorney-General, Mr. Eoghan Fitzsimons, who confirmed that he had been sent to demand Harry Whelehan 's resignation because he had misled the Government. \n SINCE then, we have been treated to the unedifying spectacle of Fianna F&/ail Ministers trying to pretend that black is white. And opposition deputies have bayed for blood as they displayed their own incompetence and the inadequacy of D&/ail systems to deal with modern demands. \n BUT the most striking development of all was the manner in which the crisis rent the Fianna F&/ail parliamentary party asunder. Mr. Ray Burke, a former Minister for Justice, led the charge. The years on the backbenches have soured him and he was determined to put the boot into Mr. Reynolds, and into the Ministers who had displaced him and Mr. Gerry Collins in Cabinet. \n HE came out like a roaring lion. Demanding that the cover-up should end. The people of the country and Fianna F&/ail supporters were fed up with it all, he thundered. He wanted the truth and he wanted it now. \n  IT was a vintage performance - on a par with Mr. Gerry Collins ' plea to Mr. Albert Reynolds in 1991 not to  \"burst up the party.\"  Mr. Burke was just the first of a line of ten deputies who said much the same thing - without the stridency - on radio, television and in the D&/ail. It was a major strike-back against Albert and his people.  \n THE truly amusing part of it all didn't happen until the following day on Morning Ireland, when Mr. David Hanley questioned the Minister of State, Mrs. Mary O'Rourke on Mr. Burke 's performance. She didn't bat an eyelid. Ray Burke, she intoned, was expressing his anger and dismay over the way in which the opposition parties had made a hames of the D&/ail inquiry into the matter. It was their incompetence that was preventing the truth from coming out, and nothing to do with Ministers or with Mr. Reynolds. It was a gobsmacking performance for its sheer effrontery. \n MRS. O'Rourke should really fly under her maiden name colours. For that performance was vintage Lenihan, and one that her brother, Brian, would be unable to better. And, as they say,  \"it wasn't from the wind she took it.\"  \n IT wasn't just that deputies in the party were gouging and kicking one another in the greatest free-for-all that the party has seen in years. Other scores were being settled too. And one of the top targets was Mr. Eoghan Fitzsimons. \n PEOPLE at the top weren't going to sit quietly and wait for the new Attorney-General to shaft them by telling all he knew about the cover-up. No. They were going to get their retaliation in first by trying to discredit him and by tarring him with the same black brush that had been used on them. And so, two documents were \"leaked\" to the Irish Independent. \n ONE of them involved a letter with a missing paragraph and the suggestion was that Mr. Fitzsimons had been responsible for the removal of this paragraph before the document was circulated to the D&/ail. But there was no proof of this. It was a case of dirty tricks. And perhaps a warning that if you play with the big boys, you can get badly hurt. \n THE whole episode has thoroughly turned the public off politics and politicians. Perhaps the worst aspect of it was that the new Fianna F&/ail Leader, Mr. Bertie Ahern, was either unable or unwilling to do anything about it. \n  WHEN Ray Burke cut loose at Albert Reynolds and his men, Mr. Ahern issued a statement calling it \"unhelpful.\" What a wishy-washy reponse! It was like calling a tornado a strong wind. And there was no suggestion Mr. Burke would be punished    through   the removal of the party whip. That was, one Bertie source said:  \"at least two or three fences away.\"   \n ALBERT was furious. Not just at Mr. Burke, but at the new party leader. And although Bertie subsequently sent out word to his supporters to    button   their lips, the damage had been done; the seeds of internal war has been sown. \n EVEN as Mr. Reynolds circulated a document to all Fianna F&/ail deputies on how to explain the cover-up and urging them to condemn the opposition parties for their D&/ail  \"Star Chamber\",  the clock was ticking towards the formation of a rainbow coalition. \n AND Mr. John Bruton, the man whose political career was in a shambles a week ago, stands at the altar with Labour and Democratic Left in expectation of becoming the next Taoiseach. It    has   been a hell of an about-turn in the fortunes of a man who nobody would throw a good word to in recent months. And it doesn't promise an easy beginning for a new government. \n THE Fine Gael Leader may be honest and decent. But he is certainly not inspiring And as the country faces into crucial months involving the Northern Ireland peace process, Mr. Bruton 's role will be absolutely central. There are signs that he has already begun to modify his views in order to take greater account of nationalist sentiment. And both he and Gerry Adams have spoken of working together. But it will take real talent to bury the suspicions and difficulties of the past, and to encourage the Provisional IRA to maintain its ceasefire. \n THERE is no reason why Mr. Bruton should not grow into the job. After all, Liam Cosgrove was not a charismatic figure, but yet he led a solid coalition arrangement. \n  IN that regard, the negotiations underway between Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left will be critical in under-pinning the stability and cohesion of a future government. A solid, up-front, government programme is the only thing that will hold the parties together for 2.5 years. And it is the economy and Northern Ireland which will provide the highest hurdles for the parties to jump.  \n\n\n<$B>\n COMMENT \n Time to Leave the Farce Behind \n With the televising of proceedings in Leinster House really coming into its own viewers were treated to ongoing entertainment with plots and counter plots, unexpected twists, back-stabbing, stage management, and political play-acting at its best, or its worst, whether you were regarding it as something serious or as the best farce in town that week. \n If ever the public had any doubts about the inefficiency of the political system, of its departments and of the whole structure of running this country they must now realise that a major job of redesigning it is essential. The actors will have time during the Christmas recess to go away and take a new look at themselves, their parties and their performances because things will never be the same again in Leinster House. \n Now it is down to the task of forming a government. As John Bruton negotiates with Dick Spring, we will soon find out whether Fine Gael 's leadership negotiating skills and firmness will match, or excel, those of the Labour chief. The new regime takes office at a crucial time for the Irish economy. By and large that economy is healthy and growth prospects seem to be reasonably good. It depends on the management. Wrong policies and decisions could easily track us way off course. It would be disastrous if inflation got a nudge forward, or if the upward trend in public spending was exacerbated. \n Proper control on the semi-state bodies is essential. Lessons should have been learned from events on that front earlier this year. The peace process, employment, control of the economy, all these are essential. The government will have to perform much better in areas of essential legislation and seriously come to grips with the snails-pace system of drafting and finalising Bills crying out for ttention and gathering dust in pigeon holes. \n Who can say, with their hands on their hearts, that the press has no role in probing areas in the political life of this country, in the semi-states, within the various departments of Government. Despite the difficulties created for both public and press in our out-moded libel laws, some newspapers did take risks and if they had not would all of us now know some of the undesirable developments of the recent past? If politicians or others in high places, try to hide unacceptable practices to the detriment of the public, or to keep back information to which the nation is entitled must there not be a watchdog there to keep the public informed? Geraldine Kennedy 's revealing article in 'The Irish Times' which made Dick Spring seem to have second thoughts was an essential development in the recent saga - though the controversy is ongoing about the sequence of events. \n Press freedoms have to be handled responsibly and newspapers must be let know they cannot get away with manufactured, unbalanced or over-sensationalised items. At the same time the public is entitled to know what is going on in the running of our country, in law breaking and in accountability, or lack of it. Far too many people want to prevent that happening and it is time the shackles were broken. \n The new Government has a difficult task, not least of all because of its disparate ingredients. However, with vigilance, responsibility and true concern for the future of this nation it can work. For all our sakes, let 's hope it does. \n\n\n<$C>\n  Conscience  \n THE COUNTLESS thousands of customers who flocked to Limerick stores on Sunday for the innocent enjoyment of an afternoon 's shopping got a rude awakening on Monday when Archbishop Desmond Connell of Dublin pronounced on Radio 1 's Morning Ireland against Sabbath trading. \n In fairness, his remarks are directed not at shoppers but at shopkeepers. Stores that open on Sundays, he maintains, are primarily motivated not by a sense of social service but by profits. That is undoubtedly so. \n And why not? Without profits, private businesses go bust and jobs are lost. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with profits. \n Archbishop Connell implies, however, that once some stores open on Sundays, others feel they have no choice but to follow suit. But surely if people choose to go into business, they must accept the consequences of free and fair competition. \n And what of the freedom of choice of the customer? No-one is dictating to anyone when to shop. Shops are open on Sundays in Limerick this Christmas purely by public demand. The proof lies in previous trading records for the festive season. \n Moreover, sales assistants, far far from being oppressed by seven-day opening, are glad of the opportunity to earn extra cash for Christmas. \n The central argument in the God and Mammon debate, however, must be the moral one: namely that Sabbath trading necessarily breaches the Third Commandment. This ignores the facts, namely that for many people Sunday shopping, far from being a chore, is a leisure activity, and that for others - such as families with two parents going out to work - it is a virtual necessity. \n But the fundamental moral issue is not Sunday observance at all but freedom of conscience.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "105f0169-cbce-4ddf-b8aa-805fc1b5c2fa", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.695452+00:00"}
{"text": "<Irish Times editorials>\n\n\n<$A>\n  ROGUES OR FOOLS?  \n In all justice it will be necessary to hear from the Attorney General, Mr Eoghan Fitzimons, and his predecessor, Mr Harry Whelehan, before forming a final or complete view of what Mr Albert Reynolds, Mr Bertie Ahern and Mrs Maire Geoghegan-Quinn told the Dail yesterday afternoon. The lawyers ' versions of events will unfold before the Committee of the House which is now set to investigate the entire circumstances surrounding the Smyth case and the appointment of Mr Whelehan as President of the High Court. \n Mr Fitzsimons, in particular, has had a series of challenges put down to him by the members of the Government he serves. He finds himself in a most invidious position. \n But if his evidence to the Committee does not damn Mr Reynolds and certain of his Cabinet colleagues as rogues, it will undoubtedly confirm them as fools. Indeed, the latter indictment is hardly necessary. Never has the Dail been presented with such pathetic, stumbling, self-serving palaver. Letters were left lying around the place. Mr Reynolds received papers which he did not understand. Mr Ahern had the job of passing them up to him - which he did, without comprehending them. The best endeavours of Mr Fitzsimons to deliver some simple, clear conclusions to Mr Reynolds and his colleagues seem to have failed to penetrate. \n The coming days will tell a lot. And there may be quite a lot to tell. At the core of the extraordinary events of the past four weeks, there still remains the unanswered question of why the mechanisms in the Attorney General 's office moved so slowly on the Smyth case - given that they had moved so very much more swiftly and efficiently in other cases. And there is the puzzling question of why Albert Reynolds went through storm and tempest, taking the highest risks (not least, as he himself has insisted, on the peace process), in order to further Mr Whelehan 's suit. If it was no more than an exercise in showing Dick Spring who was boss, it amounted to a costly lesson. \n Last night all the indications were that Mr Spring and Labour are moving towards the establishment of a rainbow coalition with Fine Gael and Democratic Left. Clearly, there is a strong body of opinion both within Leinster House and outside that an election is not desirable at this stage. It would suit political and commercial life not to be disrupted, especially over Christmas, but the case for a purgative election is a strong one. \n Mr Spring 's and Labour 's judgement stand severely indicted in this sorry saga. The facts which forced them to finally abandon their plans to re-enter government with Fianna Fail would have been made available to them had they asked. It ought not to have had to come down to the painstaking and resourceful journalism of Ms Geraldine Kennedy in  The Irish Times  to set out the details on Monday. Were it not for the publication of her report, it is almost certain that Fianna Fail and Labour would have formed a Government in the Dail yesterday. There are many among the electorate who would welcome the opportunity at this stage to pass a verdict on all of those who have contributed to the present debacle. \n Last week Labour was unwilling to have a full Dail debate to clear the air on the issues which were being pressed by the Opposition - notably by Mr John Bruton. It was only the last in a series of incidents in which the party seemed to take the position that it did not want to know the worst; the report of the Beef Tribunal, the tax amnesty, the passports affair, to take the best known examples. Up to yesterday morning it appeared that Labour was unwilling to face what virtually every other observer of the political scene could read only too clearly; that Fianna Fail had not told the whole story. Better late than never. \n\n\n<$B>\n  European Defence  \n The summit meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-Operation in Europe, which concluded yesterday in Budapest, certainly did not live up to its name. Its useful achievements - on Ukrainian adherence to the nuclear weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty, for example - were overshadowed by disagreements on NATO enlargement between Russia and the United States and, most gravely, over Bosnia, on which it proved impossible to reach a consensual statement. \n Running through these disagreements are differences between major powers on how European security frameworks should best be organised and co-operation assured, which have disturbing implications for the future of both. Warnings by President Yeltsin about the danger of a  \"cold peace\"  replacing the Cold War if NATO were to enlarge to Russia 's borders must be seen in the context of last week 's failure by the Russian foreign minister, Mr Kozyrev, to sign a Partnership for Peace agreement with NATO ministers in Brussels. Yesterday 's Russian veto of an agreed statement on Bosnia falls into the same mould. \n Revealed here is a growing feeling of insecurity among Russian leaders that flies in the face of established western policy. The Partnership for Peace has, after all, been intended to serve as a mechanism which would reassure the Russian leadership that they were not to be excluded from new frameworks of European security. If the evolution of the reform process there went well, it was assumed, NATO enlargement would become less and less necessary. If, on the other hand, the Russian evolution went badly, the Partnership for Peace would have performed the useful function of bringing the great majority of states in central and eastern Europe under NATO 's security umbrella. \n Last week 's NATO decision to pursue enlargement, which was reiterated by President Clinton in Budapest, seems to imply that the more malign scenario on the evolution of events in Russia is now believed in Washington. If not, there has certainly been a breakdown of communication and diplomacy in recent weeks. The US last week shifted its ground on the Bosnian war towards a further European attempt to find a compromise that would allow the Contact Group 's settlement plan to be agreed. It is difficult to see how this sits with a policy of rapid NATO enlargement, if this is what Washington indeed intends to pursue. \n These events signal a potentially far-reaching reorganisation of political and security relations between the US and Europe. The best method of bringing co-operation and security back to inter-state relations in Europe would be to concentrate on pursuing economic, political and security enlargements through the European Union rather than NATO. How this can best be done will be a crucial subject for debate at this weekend 's EU Council in Essen. \n\n\n<$C>\n  PRESIDENT POINTS THE WAY  \n The President, Mrs McAleese, appears to have hit her stride in her visit to Canada and the Boston area. Her packed schedule over two weeks through urban and rural centres across Canada bespoke a remarkable commitment of energy and enthusiasm and local media have commented positively on her sense of warmth and openness. \n Her itinerary in Canada reveals a good deal about the style of this presidency. Not only did Mrs McAleese choose to visit the big cities and the centres of political power. She also wanted to see the small communities in the relatively remote areas of Newfoundland where Irish emigrants settled in the last century. \n In the course of her Boston visit the President delivered a challenging address to  The Irish Times /  Harvard University Colloquium at the college 's John F. Kennedy School of Government. The import of that address, which is published today on page 10, will repay careful reading as the people of this island begin to make the painful adjustment to daily life free of politically inspired violence. \n In what she said at Harvard, she focused directly on the area where so many efforts at construction continue to founder. How does society grapple with the fact that one person 's right of free speech or right to public assembly may be the source of another person 's fear, the President asked her audience. How does society reconcile one community 's right to march or to assemble with another community 's right to live free of intimidation or provocation? And in a post-conflict phase, such as that now being entered in Ireland, how does society go about healing past wounds left by threats, fear and intimidation? \n The President told her audience of the various regulatory devices which operate in Northern Ireland where one community 's customs, traditions or language may inflame or intimidate members of the other community. She spoke of the work of the Parades Commission and the various legal measures which outlaw intimidatory or discriminatory practices and language in the workplace. The difficulty with this approach, she acknowledged, is that virtually every adjudication is perceived at community level in win-lose terms. Should it not be possible, she asked, to develop procedures and models which will yield a win-win result? \n Acknowledging that she was asking more questions than she had answers at this time, the President nevertheless indicated some important starting points. What is needed, she said, is not less freedom of expression but an enhancement of it and the provision of specific remedies, enabling victims of provocative speech and imagery to talk back, credibly and meaningfully. She urged further commitment of resources for education and research in this area and she called for the creation of  \"accessible and dedicated public talkback forums or mediation mechanisms\".  \n South Africa has the model of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Ireland, North and South, has made a start in meeting the needs of victims of violence. But what the President is pointing towards are mechanisms which will go beyond establishing culpability or compensation entitlements for past wrongs. She is pointing to the need for institutions and structures which have a preventative role vis-a-vis the problems of incitement and provocation and which can sponsor dialogue not merely in the aftermath of division but in time to avert it. What shape such institutions or structures might have is not yet clear. Many agencies in the community - not least of all the media - could have a role to play. Mrs McAleese has opened the debate and clearly laid down the markers. If her lead is not taken up, it is certain that the objective of harmony between the two great traditions of this island will be, at very least, severely retarded. \n\n\n<$D>\n  John Paul II 's Legacy  \n Not since Leo XII died in 1903 has the Roman Catholic Church witnessed a longer pontificate. Seldom has history witnessed a period of such profound change as in the 20 years since Karol Cardinal Wojtyla became Pope John Paul II. The communist governments of eastern Europe are no longer, the cold war has ended and a world order has been established in which one super-power predominates. Mikhail Gorbachev, himself credited by many for the ending of the old order, wrote upon the termination of his office as President of the USSR that the end of communism in the eastern bloc would have been impossible without the efforts of this Pope. These efforts began in his native Poland and ended on the streets of Moscow in August 1991. It is for these feats, along with his strong opposition to the new materialism which replaced the old order, that secular historians are likely to remember his papacy. \n Religious historians will have a more complicated legacy to evaluate. In judging those 20 years they will record that in a long and controversial pontificate, John Paul II was a witness to major divisions inside his own church. The first schism in over 100 years took place when the ultra-conservative Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre ordained four bishops without Vatican permission on June 30th, 1988. Many liberal members of the Catholic laity, at odds with the Pope 's views on sexuality, his authoritarian approach to church government and his apparent inability or unwillingness to understand the concerns of women, distanced themselves from Rome in a less formal manner. The gradual weakening of the independent power of national bishops ' conferences and the appointment, in the main, of bishops whose main attribute was their doctrinal orthodoxy have been causes of friction in clerical circles in many countries, most particularly in the United States. \n On a global basis John Paul II has presided over a devastating collapse in numbers of those going forward for the priesthood, especially in countries such as Ireland where the tradition of missionary service had been strong. At the same time he has been uncompromising in his opposition to the ordination of women priests. He has won international respect, however, for his personal commitment to piety and devoutness. A punishing schedule of international travel, to 117 countries, has brought the papacy closer to ordinary people. Of the world's major states only Russia, and this due to friction between the churches of Rome and Moscow rather than for political reasons, remains unvisited. \n His long-standing commitment to human rights, his work towards reconciliation with other religions, particularly Judaism, and his remarkable flow of encyclicals have made an extraordinary impact. In this latter context his most recent encyclical,  Fides et Ratio,  has been perhaps his most ambitious. In it he attempts to reconcile faith and reason while strongly attacking western philosophy as being so modest in its aspirations that it has created a culture of despair.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "0d7770c5-41d3-4046-9a33-ceb4f9415a25", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.696477+00:00"}
{"text": "<Taxes - John Major>\n\n\n<$A>\n  SECOND THOUGHTS  \n  Mary Ellen Synon  \n  Three days of every working week the Irishman is a slave  \n  Part of the population remains tax slaves, working for the benefit of the other part, who remain parasites  \n ON considering the citizens of this state, one 's mind naturally turns to thoughts of slavery. Anybody who works here turns over more than half the wealth he creates to the state. \n The term for this is taxation, but the effect is slavery: for slavery means being forced to work for the benefit of others. Three days of every working week, the Irishman is a slave. And a badly paid slave, too: in the 19th-century slave states of America, the typical slave field hand received about 90 <*> per cent sign </*> of the income he produced. The typical Irish PAYE worker receives about half as much. \n And who is it that is enslaving the Irishman? Well, that is an interesting point. Usually you would imagine that it is either the totalitarians of the right; or it is the totalitarians of the left. \n That is the way it has been in most states with a slave economy. But here we have a quirk. We have left and right both working towards enslaving the population, for different reasons - or, at least, under the guise of different philosophies - but with the same end. Which is no real comfort to the slave, but he might want to look up from the cotton-picking long enough to see whose hand holds the whip. \n First, consider the totalitarians of the Irish religious right. They, of course, do not believe that the citizen should work for his own benefit. He must, the right say, work for glory in the next life, for the word of God, for the needy, for the benefit of his family, for the benefit of other people 's families, for poor people here, for poor people anywhere. \n However, he must not work for his own benefit. That, say the religious right, is wrong. That is selfish. That is also liberty, but the religious right do not work for liberty. They work for the surrender of liberty. They work for slavery. \n The heartiest slave-drivers of this religious right are the priests and nuns who press the Government - in the name of 'justice': how the stomach turns - to pull more and more taxation from the working people so that idle people can have bigger welfare payments. \n The success of this lobbying can be seen in the result. Part of the population remain slaves, working for the benefit of the other part, who remain parasites. \n Neither group has control over its money, either how it is spent or where it comes from. Neither group is made up of citizens enjoying liberty. But we are assured this is God 's intention: money must go where it is needed, not where it is earned. \n The other slave-drivers of the right are those who say they work to protect the family, to protect morals, to bring God 's laws into civil legislation. \n Now, these people are a particularly interesting set. Mostly their policies are founded on utter irrationalities. They do not deny that their foundation is irrational; they admit it is mystical revelation, not rational argument. \n Yet sometimes their irrational motives bring them into rational territory. And the slave ought to look up and be pleased that, if only by accident, liberty is somewhere left alive. \n I mean in particular the question of legislation on abortion. The ardent right oppose abortion, which is a rational and liberal thing to do. But they oppose it for the wrong reasons. \n Consider this. The free individual lives for his own benefit. He is in slavery only when he is forced to live for the benefit of others. The individual - the free individual - needs no further justification to own his life than that life exists. \n No person, however young, must die for the benefit of another - not unless he himself chooses to. The pre-born child lives for his own benefit, not for the benefit of his mother. The law must protect the individual 's ownership of his own life. Abortion is a form of slavery taken to its most extreme. \n So no-one 's liberty - except in the rarest of cases - is endangered by laws against abortion. But the right 's warped reasoning, which by coincidence reaches the right conclusion on abortion, reaches the wrong conclusion on just about everything else. \n Marriage without the possibility of civil divorce is slavery; restriction on the free choice of willing partners is slavery - in other words, what chaps do with chaps is not something the law should be concerned about. \n The destruction of liberty is everywhere on the right. But the horrors come when one sees there is no refuge on the left. \n The left offer the slavery of democracy. They offer the totalitarianism of 51 <*> per cent sign </*>. An individual, they say, has no rights, he has only the privileges given by the majority. And the majority can remove those privileges any time: all they have to do is to pile into a polling booth. Well, anybody who has ever looked for virtue in a polling booth is bound to be disappointed. \n   \"To assure liberty, the aim of each moral choice must be self-interest\"   </h.>\n The forces of the left, of course, are even more adept at looting workers ' pay packets than are the forces of the right. They say any theft is moral if a majority vote for the theft. \n They are wily, though, in the way they hide the theft. Each citizen who is below what may be called the envy line - a statistic more genuine than the poverty line - is led to believe that if he allows a little theft from his own earnings, what is nicked from others and given to him will be a greater sum. \n In other words, he will be burgled, but he will be allowed a good pile of loot from the neighbour 's house. \n Any mug who believes his own benefit lies in stealing from others might as well climb on to the auction block and open the bidding on his own freedom. For there is a web of moral choices to be made, and the wrong choices end in slavery. To assure liberty, the aim of each moral choice must be self-interest. \n A government of thievery - no matter in whose apparent interest - is against each citizen 's self-interest. Each individual, to remain at liberty, must refuse to tread on the liberty of any other citizen. \n To refuse to steal from another citizen, to refuse to control, to refuse to  enslave,  is not altruism. It is a far better thing: it is self-interest. \n Self-interest is the powerful engine of liberty which the left hate. The left say \"steal,\" they say \"take what you have not earned\", they say \"control other men 's lives with restrictions, with demands, with guilt\". \n The individual who values liberty refuses to do all these things, not because he is protecting the liberty of others, but because he is protecting his own liberty. To agree to the controls of the left is to sell yourself into slavery. \n The alert citizen must beware how the left package their slave market: when one of the left says \"think of others\", the only rational reply can be: \"I will think of and for myself. Others are capable of thinking of and for themselves\". \n The result of relentless self-interest is a marvellous thing. It is a life of independence and liberty. It is a life without slaves or beggars or parasites. It is a life in which the totalitarians of the left - and the right - are destroyed. \n Yet the left say we must live for the benefit of others in the name of community and democracy; the right say we must live for the benefit of others in the name of God and charity. \n And the really frightening thing is, the slaves have come to believe it. So they have forged their own chains. \n  Mary Ellen Synon is a freelance columnist  \n\n\n<$B>\n  TRIBUNE EDITORIAL  \n  Is Mr. Major gone into the nudge-and-wink politics  \n WHEN is a deal not a deal? Could it be when    it 's   only 'an understanding.' People involved in politics full-time like the Taoiseach and Mr. John Major will be more than aware of what can be done by a piece of fancy sophistry. John Major says that nothing was sought, nothing was offered and nothing was given ..... which could still mean that what happened last week between himself and the Unionists (if anything happened!) might be the result of a growing awareness of the plight of each other between Mr. Major and the Unionists, and then a gradual process of policy-making. \n Being from the Fianna Fail Party, with its ability to work the 'wink-and-nudge' system to the point where it has become a political art, the Taoiseach may have been highly suspicious when he spoke on television this week and said that he believed Mr. Major when Mr. Major said that no deal had been struck. True to the form of the wink-and-nudge tradition, there can hardly have been a person in this country who did not know that he too will be highly suspicious of what might have gone on last week, but has to accept (ostensibly) what is said on the record. \n If this all sounds a little like something from Alice in Wonderland (through the glass darkly? ..... or curiouser and curiouser?) the fault lies with the fact that the Unionists got in on the nudge-and-wink game last week, albeit without the finely-tuned antennae of Fianna Fail who would have let their followers know exactly what happened but would have had to say precisely nothing. Any doubts would have been taken care of by the equally-sophisticated Fianna Fail semaphore which can signal anything from the downfall of a Taoiseach to the latest stance on The North without an overt mention of either. \n Really, does anyone believe that some form of 'meeting of minds' has not occurred between John Major and the Unionists. We go back to the era of Charlie Haughey in power as Taoiseach when one of his aides is reputed to have said (when Fianna Fail needed the Dail vote of Independent Dail Deputy Mr. Tom Foxe) .....  \"if Tom Foxe wants a general hospital on the Aran Islands, they give it to him.\"  At the time Mr. Foxe was campaigning on the basis of keeping the general hospital in Roscommon. How many \"general hospitals\" would John Major give to ensure that he stayed Prime Minister of Britain? Compared with the price of a hospital for Taoiseach, a Select Committee for Northern Ireland would be a mere bagatelle. \n Of course there was a deal done, an understanding reached, a meeting of minds, a development of policy, a  modus operandi  reached. Call it by whatever delicate name you like .... Other than a 'deal done' for that does sound shabby. It will probably emerge over a period of time; the Unionists are learning the semaphore, the nudge-and-wink. Albert Reynolds and Dick Spring may get a bit hot under their collars, but this is politics on a grand scale and the prize is Britain! Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Spring may have to become accustomed to the idea of a Select Committee and other courting of the Unionists.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "bace3c57-8b48-48d6-a686-60e5a16df19a", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.697504+00:00"}
{"text": "<Regional editorials>\n\n\n<$A>\n  BUY IRISH AND BUY LOCAL THIS CHRISTMAS  \n In an era, when the level of international trade reaches new heights, the facility to buy overseas products is easier than ever. But should we not think first before we buy? \n Local jobs should be supported where possible. \n Here in Waterford, we have many fine industries producing excellent products that deserve patronisation this Christmas. For those on a higher budget, you could buy glass from Waterford Crystal. Children could be bought Milton Bradley toys. Individual gifts could be purchased that are locally made, whether by local crafts people. The emphasis could also be on local food and drink. We should try and keep business and employment in the area, where possible. \n According to recent statistics released by the Waterford Trades Council last month, <*> pound sign </*> 6 is spent on imported goods for every <*> dollar sign </*> 4 spent on Irish made goods. If the balance could be split the other way, 30,000 to 40000 jobs could be created. Other countries are very proud of their home produce. The French rave about their wonderful food and their great cars, which they buy more than foreign ones. In England, foreign goods have tended to be very popular, has the same trend started here, with goods being sourced often in low cost countries? \n The large preponderance of foreign owned stores in Ireland in the past ten years has led to more consumer imports. \n The Trades Council has advised shoppers before Christmas to ask to see the Irish made product and compare the quality and price with other goods. Positive action can be taken at Christmas time, when there is a consumer boom, to spend more on Irish and locally produced goods where possible. \n We, in the \"Munster Express\", feel that our local advertisers also deserve support at this time of year. There is often the temptation to go to Cork or to Dublin, or even further afield as people chase bargains. This year, the big rush has been to Northern Ireland, now that we have a ceasefire. \n Waterford city centre has progressed a great deal over the past decade in terms of shopping choice. It is now a truly regional shopping mecca, given the large number of shopping malls that we now have. \n In line with the growth and trade in Waterford, other towns such as Dungarvan, New Ross and Carrick on Suir are making a bigger push to get a slice of the retail spend, emphasising their strengths such as parking and convenience for the shopper. \n We would ask our readers to encourage their families and friends to support local retailers and local products, as the Waterford Trades Council has done. \n This year could be a record Christmas in terms of spending power and should give a boost to shops, some of whom may have had a difficult year to date. \n  CHARITIES DESERVE SUPPORT  \n Local charities such as the Vincent de Paul deserve our support as well at this time of year. They are in the front line of contact with those who are badly in need of help. In last week 's paper, we related a story revealing that by the end of this year a quarter of a million pounds will be spent on its services, which included 16,000 visits. \n The Lions Club appeal will also assist many needy families at Christmas, auction items of which we carry on page 29. \n Bishop of Waterford, Most Rev. Dr. William Lee, has said that the increased demands on the St. Vincent de Paul Society would need to be met so that families in need could look to the future with some glimmer of hope. Contributions were never so badly needed as at present. \n We would hope that the people of Waterford would support their local charities. At this time of year, many charities actively fundraise, we should encourage local charities as much as possible. City Manager, Michael Doody, said that every penny collected by the Society went straight into aid. \n\n\n<$B>\n   VOICE OF THE PEOPLE   \n   Public pay is the key to growth   \n THE PROSPECTIVE political partners are just now finalising their programme for what they describe as a  Government for Renewal.  If they can indeed provide a sense of renewal after the appalling conflicts of the last few weeks, then their new administration will be widely welcomed. \n But they do have a major task ahead. The current negotiations are private, but we must assume that public sector pay is one of the key problems to be sorted out. If this issue is not tackled head on, then this incoming Government will fail to deliver the economic and social benefits which are the essential dynamo for growth. \n The entire thrust of recent government policy has been to tax wage earners highly, to penalise industry and to extract the very maximum taxation on all economic activity. This extra money has been expropriated from the public by the Revenue Commissioners with ruthless efficiency. That has been the real policy of the outgoing government and the Revenue Commissioners have carried out that policy dutifully. That is their job. \n The money collected has been transferred from individual wage earners in the private sector directly into the pockets of those working in the public sector. Thus, since 1987 wages in the public sector have risen by 70 <*> per cent sign </*> , compared with a 44 <*> per cent sign </*> increase for everyone else. \n Not only has that policy been unfair, it has had the effect of seriously slowing down, if not strangling, firms which otherwise would have been able to offer more employment. That policy has to stop, it has to be reversed. \n The outgoing Government constantly told us how good they were, but there was a large element of bluff in all their insistent assurances. In fact, the last Government was held to ransom by the public sector. The price was paid dearly by the unemployed and by those tens of thousands of bright young people who had to emigrate. The funds which should have generated jobs were swept away into the public purse. That was the true record of the last Government. \n It was a policy which denied hundreds of thousands of our young people a right to live their lives, and to develop their careers here. Those educated young people who are working in London, Birmingham, Paris and Berlin and as illegals in the United States have been cheated also of their Irish inheritance. That policy can be changed, it must be changed. \n The incoming Government must reduce taxes for lower paid workers. That is the only way in which their standard of living can increase. The new administration must insist on striking a more equitable balance between the public and the private sectors. \n We believe that the Democratic Left, Fine Gael and the Labour Party will receive a strong, positive response if, together as a united front, they adopt a policy of social reform, based on equality and justice. \n The Democratic Left is a Party with concise and practical ideas on the creation and the distribution of wealth and we do not believe that they are in any way the Party of extremists, as they are sometimes portrayed. \n Similarly, once the Labour Party abandon their excessive use of shallow, public relations hyperbole and empty moral platitudes, they will gain greatly in public respect and will be in a better position to implement policies of genuine reform. Fine Gael should also be able to work well with these partners because, despite its traditional middle class support, it has always been inspired by popular radicalism which was epitomised over a generation ago by Declan Costello 's  Just Society  document. For all these reasons we believe that the partners share a common idealism and zeal for reform. \n The new partners certainly have the potential and they have the will. All they require is a genuine unity of purpose, a spirit of tolerance and a determination to be truly loyal to each other, at least for their term in office. It can be done. In the interests of the country it must be done. \n\n\n<$C>\n  Time to Think of the Electorate  \n Over the past week John Bruton 's star seems to have taken on a new brightness in the political firmament. Up to a few weeks ago many were writing him, and his party, off for anything better than the opposition benches. Now all that has changed. The in-words of accountability and transparency have been joined by the new brand of truth launched by Ray Burke last week - \"unvarnished\". Mr. Burke wants a visible and immediate presence of the new product. \n We don't know just yet where the compass will stop or how much left of centre the new coalition will be. John Bruton will need to be a firm negotiator and Taoiseach if he is to build into the formula the required measure of control of the economy, at a time when public spending is three times more than the rate of inflation. The Labour Party, during all the huffs and the kiss-and-make-up sagas reached highs and lows in its stance on the \"high moral ground\". It was left to Geraldine Kennedy of the \"Irish Times\" to come up with a very crucial and well written story which seemed to put the final nail in the coffin of the Fianna Fail/Labour alliance. Indeed some women came into their own in a very responsible way and the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, Mary Harney, was the star of the nation during some of the earlier contributions in Leinster House. In all coalitions compromise is the name of the game in policies and in the selection of the Cabinet. Misfits in essential key portfolios would be our downfall. \n As we write the show is still very much in rehearsal, and the controversies as to who said what and when, continue. We have had our share of entertainment over the past fortnight. Now comes the real business of running the country. There is no room for farce, comedy, stage-Irishism, buffoonery or ineptitude. The electorate should have been given the opportunity to make the choice, but since that has not happened we can only hope and pray that what comes out of the bag will serve us well over the next few years. \n  A Minimal Sacrifice  \n The St. Vincent de Paul Society have launched their annual appeal and all indications are that the demands are ever growing to help meet the needs of the poor and underprivileged. \n Those of us who indulge in excesses of food and drink and cosset ourselves with some of the luxuries of life, could easily make a gesture which could be significant for many families in need. If we decide that we will be spending <*> pound sign </*> 20 on these excesses could we not with much benefit to our health set aside half of that amount for the St. Vincent de Paul Society? It would make Christmas so much more meaningful and it can be done with little effort by very many who at present make little or no contribution.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "2df454cc-eaf7-4424-826d-fd65f93c6e60", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.698402+00:00"}
{"text": "<Diverse editorials>\n\n\n<$A>\n  PROFILE \n Catherine McGuinness  \n  Calm judge with a brief to reconcile \n By Cathal MacCoille  \n CATHERINE McGuinness 's status as one of the most accomplished and fulfilled figures of her generation was well established before last Friday morning, when she formally opened the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. \n Apart from her being a mother, a senator, a political speechwriter, a leading member of the Church of Ireland 's synod, a lawyer and, since last February, a Circuit Court judge, the number of bodies she has served on would be enough work for several people. \n She has been a member of the Council of State, the Voluntary Health Insurance board, the National Economic and Social Council, the second Commission for the Status of Women, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marital Breakdown, and the Incorporated Society for the Promotion of Protestant Schools. She has also chaired the National Social Services Board, the Employment Equality Agency and the National College of Art and Design. \n Even that list leaves out the inquiry into the Kilkenny incest case, which she chaired - the report 's damming and detailed indictment of the failure of state services to detect and prevent a young girl 's suffering at the hands of her father would have ensured, if she never did anything else, that her contribution to society would be widely acknowledged. \n Now she has taken on an even more difficult task - chairing a body which aims to reconcile, but which has so far failed to attract those with whom its founders wish to be reconciled. The task of reconciling the absolutist aims of Sinn Fein with those of the parties from Dail Eireann is daunting in itself. And, as if these difficulties were not enough, there are the doubts of all participants that the forum 's debates will be not only inconclusive but marginal to the main event - the negotiations between governments, and between northern parties and the British. \n Catherine McGuinness was born in 1934 in Belfast where her father was a Church of Ireland minister in Dunmurry. After attending Alexandra College as a boarder, she took a degree in French and Irish at Trinity. \n At the college 's Cumann Gaelach, she met Proinsias Mac Aonghusa, the journalist and broadcaster whom she later married (they have three children). \n Their marriage remains a source of fascination, both to their friends and to people who know them only through their public roles, as a union formed by two people who come from different ends of a political and cultural spectrum. The differences are often over-stated. Each took the same route into active politics in the Labour Party of the 1960s (she as a parliamentary assistant and scriptwriter, he as a leading member and Dail candidate); they share a love of the Irish language, of art, and of Paris, which they usually visit at least once a year. \n It is in their personalities that most people who know them see the greatest difference, although one former colleague of Proinsias Mac Aonghusa in RTE linked this to their different careers. \n  \"She always wanted to  do  things, whereas Proinsias 's main aim in life was to find out who was doing things and why, and if possible to know more than the politicians he was dealing with. The Machiavellian image which he cultivated - and which I don't believe was ever as malign as some people liked to think - was the exact opposite of her style of working.\"  \n One friend of the couple said he did not know of any sustained relationship between two such different people.  \"They 're like chalk and cheese - they 're total opposites in terms of their personalities, their opinions and their relations with other people.\"  \n  \"Anyone looking at them would wonder how they co-exist. But they 're extraordinarily close, they 're great company - it 's just one of the mysteries of life how such different people match each other perfectly, but they do.\"  \n Another friend said they were often on different sides of an argument.  \"Their views on the North would certainly be different. But you never get the sense that they 're disagreeing as part of a deeper agenda, the way you sometimes see with other couples.\"  \n When her husband was expelled from the Labour Party in 1967, after several bitter disputes with the leadership, she resigned from her post. \n She became interested in law in the mid-1970's, as a result of her membership of the Adoption Board. She later recalled how, after becoming a barrister in 1977 (at the age of 42), she met Mella Carroll, now a High Court judge, in the Four Courts robing room.  \"Don't let them tell you you can't succeed because you 're a woman,\"  Carroll told her. \n Her legal practice was mixed at first, but she later built a high reputation for her work on family law cases. One of her arguments, in favour of a woman 's right to a share in the family home as a result of her work in the home, was upheld by Mr Justice Barr in the High Court. His judgement was overturned by the Supreme Court in 1991, and the issue remains unresolved at a political level. \n Legal colleagues are unanimous in describing Catherine McGuinness as clear-thinking, hard-working, extremely pleasant to deal with, competent and well-briefed in every case she has undertaken. \n  \"She was seen as competent and hard-working rather than a wonderful advocate,\"  said one lawyer.  \"But it was a great mistake to underestimate her. There 's a touch of steel there, and if a case got nasty, as family law cases sometimes do, she was well able to look after herself.\"  \n In the seven months since her appointment as a Circuit Court judge, she has quickly established for herself a reputation for fairness.  \"There 's a lot of bitchiness at the Bar, but very few people have a bad word to say about her,\"  said one lawyer.  \"There was a certain element who said that, because her experience was mainly in family law, she would only be able for family law cases, but she 's had several civil and criminal cases since her appointment, and she 's been excellent.\"  \n One of her principal leisure interests is singing with Dublin 's Culwick Choir. Shortly after her appointment as a judge, she appeared with the choir in a performance of Rossini 's Petite Messe Solennelle at the National Concert Hall and always takes part in its charity performances of Handel 's Messiah at Christmas.  \n  \"I can't remember her missing a concert,\"  said one member of the choir.  \"She 's a marvellous person to sing beside because she 's so reliable musically.\"  She also sings in her local parish church in Kill o' the Grange and will sing when called upon at legal functions. \n Lawyers regard McGuinness as a perfect choice for the job of chairing the forum.  \"She 's very calm, very fair, and she 's always had a real interest in the northern thing,\"  said one barrister.  \"She has the perfect temperament for the job, as well as a deep passion to make a go of it. And, as far as trying to reconcile deep divisions and bitterness is concerned, you could hardly get a better training than in family law cases. The only thing people involved in most marital disputes  don't  do is kill each other.\"  \n\n\n<$B>\n  What Else Is Buried In Political Mire?  \n It is fortunate for Irish politicians that Christmas is about to create a natural break of a week or two in political life in this country. Otherwise the recent cycle of debacles which has already engulfed Albert Reynolds as Taoiseach, Fianna Fail and Labour as partners in government and several individual ministers, might well swamp the entire political system. With each passing day we are getting further evidence of the less-than-wholesome manner in which people in power carry on their business. So far it has not been a pretty sight. The break for Christmas will be a relief. \n There are few people celebrating the revelations of recent weeks. Even the large anti-Fianna Fail lobby in this country are not triumphant about the way the party has been humiliated in recent weeks. The sight of open warfare in Fianna Fail would normally delight political opponents but this time there is an air of despair among the general public because it is obvious that the Labour party is not a lot better when they get their hands on power. \n Whether Fine Gael, Democratic Left or the PDs would be any different if and when they become part of the government we cannot yet tell. But what is about power that makes otherwise sensible and honest men and women behave as as of they owned the country and were unanswerable to the general public? How can members of a government so quickly forget that the basis of their power lies not in the chauffeur-driven Mercedes but in the votes of the plain people of Ireland? If they remembered that salient fact they could scarcely become so contemptuous of the voters. \n This country should have a general election in January so that people of Ireland, in whom power ultimately lies through their franchise, can have their say. It matters little that after the elections we might have roughly the same alignment of political parties in the Dail. After the events of recent weeks all politicians, but particularly Fianna Fail and Labour ones, should be made face the public, knock on doors and answer questions from ordinary people without seeking immunity. It is fair to say that the general public has been shocked and genuinely dismayed at the amount of intrigue and deception which has been shown to operate in government circles in recent weeks. \n What worries people most is this. What we have witnessed in recent weeks may be just the tip of the iceberg. If so much dubious conduct took place in relation to a minor event such as the appointment of a judge, how much more of the same sort of unsavoury conduct may have taken place over the years in connection with far more serious matters - such as the recent Tax Amnesty for instance? \n This newspaper and others have often been savaged by Fianna Fail activists in the past few years for daring to criticise the behaviour of politicians. After the revelations of the past three weeks we are entitled to feel justified in our criticism. \n\n\n<$C>\n COMMENT \n  Opportunities  \n  In a week in which our hotels and guest houses are full with visitors it is difficult to think that our tourism industry, both locally and at national level, is suffering. It is difficult when there are thousands thronging our streets to believe that, as our front page states today, these are tough times for the city 's hoteliers.  \n But these few weeks are the only weeks when the 'no vacancies' signs go up in Galway. When our hotels are suffering it is safe to assume that our entire tourism industry and all that depends on it is also, in turn, in a barren period. \n A recession which still continues to affect our most important markets is a substantial reason for the decline in our tourism market but it is certainly not the only one. \n As Alan Moody, local chairman of the Irish Hotels ' Federation (IHF) points out in today 's Observer, huge amounts of money have been invested in the hotel industry locally in recent years. Galway has seen a massive increase in the number of 'beds' available over the last few years. An estimated 350 new beds have come on stream due to new hotels and extensions to existing ones not to mention the practical eruption of new guest houses all over the city and its outskirts. \n Mr. Moody points out that the marketing budget for Bord Failte has been cut in real terms in recent years and that unless there is a substantial increase in that budget we cannot expect an improvement on this region 's or this country 's tourism figures. \n Why, for example, do we rarely if ever see Japanese tourists on the streets of Galway? Here is a truly massive market that is being practically ignored by this country because Bord Failte cannot afford to market there. The streets of London and almost every major European city are thronged annually by Japanese visitors, yet Ireland remains, no doubt, a complete mystery to the potential Japanese tourist. \n This is but one example of the lack of foresight and confidence which is depriving this country of potential lucrative business. Tourism is our second most important industry. Let us hope that the calls of Alan Moody and his colleagues will be heeded.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "dbb2951b-a1f2-4a58-afe8-09b063052150", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.699565+00:00"}
{"text": "<Grace Notes>\n\n\n<$A>\n Grace Notes \n She went down the front steps and walked along the street to the main road. At this hour of the morning there was little or no traffic. If there was a car, then it sounded just like that - a car going past in the wet - there was no other city noise. It was still dark and the street lights were reflected on the road surface. She tucked her hair back and put her collar up as far as it would go. The raincoat was creased as if it had just been unpacked. She made her way to the bus station on foot carrying a small hold-all. \n She was early at the airport stance and walked up and down the concrete pavement. It was lined and felt, through the soles of her shoes, like hard sand close to the water 's edge. It was a way of not thinking - to concentrate on her surroundings. Somewhere a man was whistling - at least she assumed it was a man. Women rarely whistled. \n In the bus she chose a place towards the back and put her knees up against the seat in front of her. The bus was empty and warm. She watched the chrome seat rails vibrate in unison as the engine idled. If she stared at things, then it helped block out stuff. Like Anna. She did not dare think about that. Two people got on. She noticed that her fists were clenched and she consciously relaxed them, turned her hands palm upwards on her lap to see if it would make a difference. \n On the motorway they drove towards the January dawn, a sky of yellow light and dark cloud. Then as the bus careered through the rain and spray thrown up by the growing traffic, at seventy miles an hour, she began to cry. It came over her and she just let it happen. She tried to make as little noise as possible but the others on the bus heard her and looked round. It helped her to stop when she saw her distorted face reflected in the window. She had done it before - used the bathroom mirror in the same way. You just looked so awful, you stopped. \n In the airport she bought her tickets with the money Peter and Liz had lent her. She sat in the middle of the concourse trying to think of nothing, trying not to listen to the airport chimes, the flight announcements. People walked around her but she did not look up. She continued to stare at her feet. She was wearing brown court shoes and denim jeans. Somehow talcum powder had got on to her left shoe and dulled the leather. She wondered how it had survived the rain. \n At one side of the lounge men were building a staircase, hammering incessantly. Somebody was sawing wood by hand - better than the scream of a power-saw. She thought the sound nostalgic - like the hee-haw of a donkey. Somewhere a baby was crying. It was a very young - a week, maybe two. The exhalation of each cry seemed infinitely long. She did not dare to think of babies. \n She needed the toilet. Beside the sign for LADIES and GENTS was one for a BABY CHANGING ROOM. If only it was as easy as that. Don't particularly like this baby, would you mind changing it?' Afterwards, washing her hands, she looked in the mirror and saw her eyes puffy with crying. \n An airport was the place for such things. People meeting and people parting. Tears of one sort or another. Some things were too painful. Offspring and what they did to you. \n Everybody said she took after her father. The urge to cry came over her again but this time, facing herself in the mirror, she controlled it. She wondered what it would be like to face the mirror in a moment of joy. But this seemed such an impossibility. She took one of her red and grey capsules and washed it down, gulp-swallowing water sipped from the arc of a drinking fountain. \n Outside the toilets school parties from France and Germany stood in stiff groups photographing themselves. They talked loudly without removing their Walkmans. Their headsets sizzled and tished. Two policemen went past in shirtsleeves - one hugging a machine-gun close to his chest. \n Her flight was called and she went through Security and then through Special Security for those people travelling to Northern Ireland. The body search the uniformed woman gave her was close to being offensive. Breasts and buttocks flicked by her touch. A Special Branch policeman looked at her ticket. \n  'The reason for your trip?'  \n  'I 'm going home.'   \n  'Business or pleasure?'  \n  'Neither.'  \n He looked at her, his fingers playing with the ticket. \n  'For what reason?'  \n  'A funeral.'  \n  'Someone close? ' \n She nodded. He handed her back her ticket. \n  'Sorry. On you go.'  \n As the plane turned, the runway lights formed a squat triangle to the horizon. The window was covered with shuddering droplets of rain.The engine note changed, went up an octave, as they raced for take-off. Being pressed back into her seat as they accelerated was a kind of swooning. At this speed with the engine note almost a scream the rain droplets became minute, with tails streaking across the glass - like individual sperm. \n On holiday her father wore an Arran sweater, full of cable and blackberry stitching, knitted with untreated wool - he said the untreated nature of the wool repelled the rain. Her mother said it repelled her too. The smell of it was something awful. Like a wet dog. \n His voice was one of the greatest things in the world - just talking. He had a big Adam 's apple which bobbed when he spoke. When she was very young she would sit on his knee and reach out a finger to touch it as it moved - the sound he made, guttural, so deep it resonated with her insides. \n When they dropped down through the cloud at Aldergrove she saw how green the land was. And how small the fields. A mosaic of vivid greens and yellows and browns. Home. She wanted to cry again. \n The bus into Belfast was stopped at a checkpoint and a policeman in a flak jacket, a young guy with a ginger moustache, walked up the aisle towards her, his head moving in a slow no as he looked from side to side, from seat to opposite seat for bombs. He winked at her,  'Cheer up love, it might never happen.'  \n But it already had. \n On the bus home she watched the familiar landmarks she used as a child pass one by one. Toomebridge, her convent school, the drop into low gear to take the hill out of Magherafelt. \n The bus stopped at a crossroads on the outskirts of her home town and a woman got off. Before she walked away, the driver and she had a conversation, shouted over the engine noise. This was the crossroads where the Orangemen held their drumming matches. It was part of her childhood to look up from the kitchen table on still Saturday evenings and hear the rumble of the drums. Her mother would roll her eyes,  'They 're at it again.'  \n It was a scary sound - like thunder. Like the town was under a canopy of dark noise. One summer 's evening she 'd been out a walk with her father and they 'd come across a drumming match as it was setting up. \n  'Oi oi, Catherine, would you look at this nonsense.'  He held her hand tighter. Land-Rovers and vans had been drawn up on to the grass verges. A party of men was gathering. A couple of drums were being taken from the back of a Land-Rover. The drums were two to three feet deep as well as huge in circumference. They were so big that it took two men to help each drummer struggle into his harness. They hung the drum around his neck and each drummer leaned back as far as he could and supported the drum against his stomach. Then they handed him two long rods. There was a thin drummer and a fat one. Both were hatless and in shirt-sleeves. The fat one had a tanned face which stopped at his hat line. Above that, his skin was white. He rattled the rods against the skin of the drum, testing it. The drum was so big in relation to the man that Catherine thought of a penny-farthing. \n  'They 're made of goat skin,'  said her father.  'King Billy-goat skin. You could smell the stink of it from Omagh.'  \n When she 'd heard the drums in her home their rhythm had been fudged by distance and the sound had become an indistinct rumble. Now here, close up, it was a different thing altogether. Her father leaned over to her ear as if to shout something above the noise of the drumming, but instead shook his head. When the drums ceased, he whispered to her,  'They 're supposed to be able to play different rhythms, different tunes -  Lilliburlero  and what have you - but it all sounds the same to me. A bloody dunderin. On the Twelfth they thump them so hard and so long they bleed their wrists. Against the rim. Sheer bloody bigotry.'  Catherine stared at the flailing sticks, felt her eardrums pummelled.  'They practise out here above the town to let the Catholics know they 're in charge. This is their way of saying the Prods rule the roost.'  \n But Catherine was thrilled by the sound, could distinguish the left hand 's rhythm from the right. She tried to keep time with her toes inside he shoes. There were slaps and dunts on the off-beats, complex rhythms she couldn't begin to write down - even now, never mind then. The two sticks were working independently. The hands tripping each other up. A ripple bouncing back and interfering with the other ripples which had first started it. The drums were battered so loud she felt the vibrations in her body, was sure the sky and the air about her were pounding to the beat. It didn't exactly make her want to dance, more to sway. But there was an edge as well - of fear, of tribal war drumming. The gathering of men turned to stare across the road. \n  'Come on,'  said her father.  'You 're looking at a crowd whose highest ambition, this year and every year, it to march down streets where they 're not wanted. Nothing to do with the betterment of mankind of the raising of the human spirit.'  Her father 's hand tightened on hers to that it began to hurt.  'It 's their right, their heritage. God love a duck. Bowler-hatted dunderheads. Gather-ups. The Orange dis-Order, I call them. And the politicians that lead them are ten times worse, for they should know better. The whole problem, Catherine, is racist. I 've heard Protestants saying,  \"The one side is as bad as the other\" . It 's just not true. It 's the Protestant side 's bigoted. The Catholics are only reacting to being hated. And it 's a polite kind of hatred, too. Around the Twelfth the Prods 'll say,  \"Hello.\"  Any other time of the year they 'll say,  \"Hello, Brendan.\"  And it 's not just the guttersnipes. If anything, the bloody lawyers and doctors and businessmen are worse - men who 've been educated.'  \n In the town itself she was surprised to see a Chinese restaurant and a new grey fortress of a police barracks. She stood, ready to get off at her stop. There was something odd about the street. She bent at the knees, crouched to look out at where she used to live. It was hardly recognisable. Shop-fronts were covered in hardboard, the Orange Hall and other buildings bristled with scaffolding. Some roofs were covered in green tarpaulins, others were protected by lath and sheets of polythene. \n  'What 's happened here?'  she asked the bus driver. \n  'It got blew up. A bomb in October.'  \n  'Was anybody hurt?'  \n  'They gave a warning. The whole place is nothing but a shell.'", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "4fb17430-2fc5-4632-ba33-33aaec4babef", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.700619+00:00"}
{"text": "<Eureka Street>\n\n\n<$A>\n That night I went to see Mary. I still didn't know where she lived so I landed up at the bar where she worked. As I went in, the Protestant bouncer showed me, with a turn of his puffy shoulders, that he was sick of the sight of me. My eye had already turned dark where the man with the bed had hit me earlier. I must have looked insalubrious. I guessed the bouncer might show some form if I pissed him off too much so I gave him a special smile. \n Mary 's face went sick when she saw me. I saw a mumbled word between her and a colleague and the colleague approached me and asked me what I wanted to drink. I lied and she brought me some beer. \n I sat there for two hours, beer upon beer. I hated bars but it was a difficult city in which to lead a life without them. In the end, some shame in me made me just walk up to her and ask her to talk to me. \n  'Give me a minute,'  she said wearily. \n She whispered some more with her friend and then grabbed her coat and stood by my table. Her face was grim. She didn't look like she meant to go anywhere nice with me. \n  'Not here,'  she said. \n She took me to a swish hamburger joint nearby. We sat and drank cheap coffee. \n  'What happened to your eye?'  \n  'I was moving furniture.'  \n  'What?'  \n  'I hit my head against something.'  \n  'I don't believe you.'  \n  'You don't have to.'  \n There was a pause. Not a comfortable one. She looked at me. Her eyes shone and I knew there was bad news and bad news. She gave me the bad news first. \n  'I want you to leave me alone,'  she said. \n It wasn't easy to take this talk from her but I guessed that she had made a lot of things not happen. She wasn't treasuring any memories and I was making myself one big drag. But there was that love we 'd made which she could not delete. It was less than a week and my mouth still tasted of her mouth. I felt like I could breathe her breath. \n  'Mary, I can't leave you alone. I don't want to leave you alone. That makes it complicated.'  \n Her face went slack and her mouth trembled in a way that made it so very difficult not to just kiss her right there. \n  'What do you want from me?'  \n And what did I want from her? I wanted her hand on my face, her head bent for me, her lips on mine. I wanted her to say soft words that would make my heart lurch and my face burn. \n I gave her that. Exactly. Word for word. That wasn't bad going and I imagined there 'd be some big reward for all that unblank prose. \n  'You don't understand.'  Her voice was gentler, more permissive after all my fancy talk. \n  'What don't I understand?'  \n  'It 's impossible.'  \n I had a series of great speeches in stock all about possibility and impossibility. And it was hard not to feel optimistic sitting there amongst the bright plastic and the teenage bon vivants with all the primary colours making shapes in Mary 's eyes. \n  'Impossibility never stopped anything actually happening.'  \n  'But I love Paul. I don't want to hurt him.'  \n Paul was the cop boyfriend. I couldn't muster much feeling for his civilian predicament. \n  'It 's just impossible,'  she continued. \n I was energized, ardent.  'You're right. It isn't possible. Or likely. Or even democratic. Nobody gave you the right to make me feel like this.'  \n  'And what about Sarah?'  \n I was briefly impressed by her high-grade memory.  'Sarah? That 's old love, that 's dead love. That 's love that never was. I do her no disservice. I doubt that she remembers me at all.'  \n The sick look returned to her face. The one she had worn when she saw me first that night. Her mouth pursed under some assumption of sisterhood.  'Two years ' time, you 'd say the same of me.'  \n  'Would I?'  \n  'Yes.'  \n  'Would you like some long odds on that?'  \n She smiled, pleased and flattered despite her firm intentions. I 'd never had a problem with vanity. \n  'I'm going to marry him,'  she said. \n  'That 's what you think.'  \n  'What would you know about it?'  \n I was confident. I was sure. That was always a bad sign. \n  'Do you often sleep with someone when you intend to marry someone else?'  \n My mouth was still moving with those last couple of words when I knew how badly I 'd blown it. Her cheeks flushed and she sat straighter. She pulled her coat tighter around her and pushed her coffee cup away from her. She looked like she was going to go. \n And then for the first time I experienced lust-free lust. I wanted someone 's flesh pressed to mine in a way that was almost completely without desire. But she walked out. She just stood up, shook her head, mumbled something I couldn't hear and walked away. My head fell upon the table. It made a hollow noise. \n I left soon after. Though it was not late, the streets hummed with discontent and wintry malice. There were lots of cops around. I even thought I could see Mary talking to one of them but I couldn't be sure. I hoped that if it was her then it wasn't her boyfriend she was talking to. \n It was near chuck-out time for the bars and there 'd been a couple of big bomb scares in the city centre. The siren sounds wafted in the wind and down Arthur Street I could see some desultory scurrying and white tape stretching. The cops were always jumpier if there was a series of bomb hoaxes. I think they preferred real bombs to endless hoaxes. It was like Russian roulette and I don't think they liked waiting for the one that would be real. It had been a pretty busy day for the boys with bombs. One at lunchtime in a multi-storey car park. A mortar had been fired at some soldiers and there had been the one Chuckie and I had heard earlier. And then all the hoaxes. \n But I looked at the people on the streets, I couldn't help thinking that it was still no big deal. It used to be different. We all used to be much more scared. After the biggest blasts in the seventies (recently revived for a second successful season), the colour of the streets always seemed drained and muted as if the colours, too, had been blown away. \n But now it was all just an inconvenience, all just a traffic jam. I found the Wreck in a side-street. A couple of cops and soldiers were loitering there. I got in and tried, ineffectually, to start it up. Just as it was beginning to chug into some semblance of life, a soldier sauntered over, his rifle slung across his pelvis in a carefree fashion. \n I wound down my window and put on my I-don't-mind-being-questioned-by-the-security-forces-I-know-you-have-to-do-it face. It was a pretty complicated expression. \n The young soldier leaned down to my open window. His face was adolescent and his accent was Lancashire prole.  'This your car?'  The inevitable start to the litany of enquiry. \n  'Yes.'  \n  'This your only car?'  \n  'Yes.'  My voice was untesty. It might have been a tense day for these guys with all the ordnance going round town. I reached for the glove compartment to get some papers to prove that the Wreck was indeed mine. \n The soldier snorted briefly. 'No, no, that 's all right, mate. It 's just we thought you were driving it for a bet.'  \n I didn't need to laugh since he laughed so hard he laughed for both of us. I could hear his colleagues pissing themselves across the street. The soldier bent double and squeezed some feeble words of apology between the whinnies of his laughter. The Wreck, showing rare form, started amidst all the mockery and I drove off. \n A couple of hours later, I was at home, making chase with my cat. He 'd peed in the bath again and the sight of that little yellow pool around my plughole had sent me spare. It was so yellow. Somehow, you didn't expect it to be yellow. Like it was almost human. Unlike the cat itself. I 'd chased him down the stairs, under the chairs, over the tables and so on. He was fucking quick, my cat. \n I suppose that being pissed at my cat just because I was already blue wasn't fair. Mary, Sarah, my job: none of it was his fault. But he was unlucky enough to come near the end of a story he wasn't really part of. So, I ran after him with murder in my heart. \n I 'd got home depressed. Mary had left me making no mistake. When I got back there were a couple of messages. I had nearly wept at all this human contact, even though one had been from Marty Allen, telling me what an asshole I was - as if I didn't know already. Chuckie had called too. He sounded jugged again. Apparently, he 'd just had a big date with his American girl. She 'd agreed to go out with him again. But apparently she wanted a double date with her flatmate. That was where I came in. Chuckie had happily volunteered me to field the friend. Next Thursday, the message said. \n I would think about that later. But for now the important thing was to catch my cat and kill him. I 'd nearly cornered him between a bookshelf and a sofa when my doorbell rang loudly. I froze. I thought the Pet Protection League were on my case. I looked at the big clock on my wall. It was after midnight. Belfast isn't the best town for those after-midnight social calls and, as I walked to my front door, I had the familiar fifteen-second feeling that there were two men in bomber jackets and balaclavas with Browning automatics standing at my door with some sincere political objectives. I shucked through it, as I always did, and opened up. \n A policeman stood there, his hand raised to the bellpush. I sighed with a mixture of guilt and relief. I spent most of my life thinking that I should be arrested so cops made me uneasy. I wondered if I was going to get grief for hitting Crab. A complaint to the cops wasn't his style, but Marty Allen might have done it just for fun. \n  'Yes?'  I asked. \n The cop narrowed his eyes and asked me in a shaky voice, which surprised me, whether my name was my name. What now? I thought, as I answered that, yes, my name was indeed my name.   The bang on my chops seemed to happen all by itself. I 'd seen no arm, no hand. The blow knocked me back against my open door and he followed up with the other glove across my mouth. \n Imagine my surprise! \n He 'd come in on me now and swung me round onto the staircase and I felt the stairs bang into my spine. After he 'd cracked me in the balls and headbutted me a couple of times, I began to understand I was in a fight there. I was upset, naturally, and it was beginning to hurt as well. I was wondering what to do when he started giving me some elbow to the side of the head. \n In my experience, sudden fights had always been like this. When somebody really surprised you, it was really surprising. In the movies, tough guys always handled surprise fights with lightning reflexes, immediate escalation. Us real-life tough guys needed time to get used to the idea, we needed written invitations, consultations, legal advice. \n I was getting messed up rapidly by the time I 'd summoned the verve to consider a response but by that time the cop himself was puffed out. He stepped back to catch a breath. Then I realized that something was missing. Where were his colleagues? How come the others were missing all this fun?", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "be1e696e-f8b6-4917-bd3d-90622f753b5f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.701629+00:00"}
{"text": "<Touch and Go>\n\n\n<$A>\n TOUCH <*> ampersand </*> GO \n SAM McAUGHTRY \n ONE \n DOWN IN THE CENTRE of Belfast, only twenty minutes ' walk away, the Court of Criminal Appeal was hearing my case. For some reason nobody had told me that I wasn't going to be there. For the next two days the courtroom would be full of men with wigs and gown and nothing in their heads but disputation. They would play the legalistic game, read from law reports, spectacles on the end of their noses, determining whether this strand of evidence should be accepted or that one rejected. It didn't seem right that they should do this without my being there, to see and to be seen. It might help to remind them of just what it was they were about. \n Two and a half days and then I would know. Months ago, through all the preliminary appearances and through the trial itself, I had made for myself artificial horizons beyond which I had taught myself not to look, one for each of the early court hearings, one for the trial, one for the appeal, one for the decision of the Minister of Home Affairs as to whether or not he saw any reason to interfere with the due course of the law, and then, of course, only one horizon would be left. \n At the end of my trial I had taken the sentence well. The papers had all said so.  'With composure'  , that 's how they 'd put it. But when, in two and a half days, they would come to tell me the outcome of the appeal, when I came to the limits of that horizon, there wouldn't be any reporters to tell how I 'd take it. I could react in any bloody bastarding way I felt like reacting. It wouldn't matter to anybody except myself. \n I should have paid more attention when the lawyers were setting out to me the grounds of my appeal. If I had, I 'd have been better able to mark the long hours. As it was, all that I could do was listen to one screw of the deathwatch saying the Serenity Prayer, the boozers ' doxology:  'God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things that I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.'  \n It was all right for him - he was going home when his four hours were up, he could look for serenity and courage and wisdom and feel the wife 's leg at the same time. But over in England in a pub called Help The Poor Struggler, Albert Pierrepoint, the public executioner, would be reading about me. I knew all about him. In another world, at another time, Dicky Walters had told me, and Dicky had studied Pierrepoint the way Newton had studied gravity. \n The hangman was a wee man, liked to sing Irish songs and do conjuring tricks in the bar. If - when - the Court of Criminal Appeal rejected my submission, it would give me three clear Sundays and then I would take a walk. The day before the execution, Pierrepoint would arrive at Crumlin Road jail with his bag. In the bag would be the straps, the rope, the shackle, and the white cap. \n When the time came for the wee cunt to slip the white cap over my head, my eyes would have looked on the last horizon. \n TWO \n THE BOAT TRAIN FROM Larne slowed just by Jennymount Mill. Mother had worked there as a weaver before she 'd married Dad. She 'd always been proud of it. Weaving was clean work, not like spinning or doffing; weavers didn't stand in water with their skirts hoisted up to the houghs. \n My poor, lovely mother was the reason I was here. Twenty-four hours earlier I 'd been in Bari, Italy. \n  'I say, Reilly, may I?'  The C of E padre was a nightly piss merchant. Life was funny: he could preach Christianity with a hangover and a clear conscience, while I, an atheist, felt as guilty as sin about my boozing. \n I nodded him into the office. When my flying was over they 'd made me a staff officer at Air HQ Bari, helping the Eyeties re-form their Regia Aeronautica. \n The padre shimmered in, like Jeeves.  'I 'm afraid it 's not good news, Paddy.'  \n I was in no condition to hear bad news. It 's something I 've said to some brass hat last night, I thought. Christ, maybe I 've insulted the air vice-marshal. As usual, my sweat seemed to stink like sewer seepage. \n  'It 's your mother, and I 'm sorry to say she 's seriously ill.'  He squeezed my arm. Padres are great touchers.  'Deeply sorry.'  \n To be truthful, all I 'd felt at first was relief. Drink blackouts begot daymares. Only a couple of weeks earlier, on Christmas morning, I 'd woken up to learn that the previous evening I 'd bopped a fellow officer. He 'd disputed my version of  'The First No&8el'. \n  'She didn't say anything in her letters'  was all I could say. \n  'Well, mothers don't, bless them.'  \n At least with an excuse like this nobody could blame me for beering it up. But they didn't give me time to do it at Bari. When a staff officer was posted away the air vice-marshal liked to have a word, but in my case there was no invitation. It was Johnny Watson, the camp commandant, who said goodbye:  'Mind yourself, Hugh. I 'm sorry about your mother.'  \n Mind yourself. \n I 'd got used now to my real friends telling me to mind myself. Johnny Watson was fair-haired, blue-eyed, a public schoolboy pilot, going for the law when he was demobbed. We were close, having been squadron buddies. Afterwards Johnny had saved my bacon a good few times on the HQ campus after piss-up balls-ups. \n He smiled and shook my hand.  'Just bloody take it easy, you old bugger. You made it through the war - don't cock it up in civvy street.'  \n He 'd got me priority all the way to London. I was on a Communications Flight Anson to Pomigliano in two hours, and fixed up in a Dakota to Blackbush after another two. A day in London, strangely sober, sipping half-glasses of beer like an Englishman, walking into Cox and King 's Bank to draw the first pounds sterling I 'd seen for three years. The soft-eyed woman in the bank smiled at me.  'I do all the air force officers ' accounts beginning with R and S. I know all my officers. So glad that you got through all right.'  \n The train, groaning and squealing, drew into York Street station. I grabbed my cases, swung down on to the platform, and walked quickly towards the barrier, one of a crowd of returning soldiers, sailors, airmen and merchant seamen, with their suitcases and their kitbags, their wary eyes, and their thoughts. Relatives, friends, sweethearts, waited on the other side of the barrier. Women were crying, being lifted, swung around, feet off the ground; fathers, brothers, shaking hands. \n I saw our Bill, in his dungarees. He put out a hand, but when I came up to him I laid my cases on the ground, put my arms around him, and it was touch and fucking go for crying. \n He was seventeen, with a face more innocent than mine ever was. He took a case, we went out of the station, past the taxis with the gasbags on their roofs, on to York Street. I pointed Bill towards the Edinburgh Castle on the other side of the road. Halfway there we were halted by a convoy of heavy carts coming up from the deep-sea docks nearby, the huge draught horses striking sparks from the granite square setts. \n The road cleared and we crossed to the bar. Inside, in the just-opened smell of disinfectant, Brasso and whiskey, I ordered a short for myself and a mineral for Bill. We sat down beside a soldier in web equipment. I smiled and looked Bill over. His hair wasn't as dark as mine, more of a brown than a black. His eyes were blue and wide and innocent; mine were brown, after Mother 's side. He reached up to about the bottom of my ear. When I 'd joined up six years earlier, he 'd only been four hands higher than a po. \n I thought of all the things I 'd done that he hadn't. When he was twenty-five he wouldn't be needing the whiskey, for one thing. But it was gorgeous to be home. Bill was looking at me as if I was Gregory Peck. He took a sip of sarsaparilla.  'Flight lieutenant pilot,'  he said.  'Tommy Boyd 's brother 's only a sergeant cook.'  \n  'Up Tommy Boyd, then, with a wire brush.'  I sank the whiskey, pretended to punch him on the button, and rose to go. \n Walking up Duncairn Gardens, I looked around at the city I 'd left behind three years earlier, in January 1943. The blitzed ground between houses was overgrown with weeds and wild grass, and moss had softened the tops of the broken walls. Civilians walked past with their heads down, the women in headscarves and tight-pulled winter coats, the men in grey or brown raincoats and duncher caps. They walked like a people who had lost a war. \n  'How 's Mother?' \nBill didn't hesitate.  'She 's very serious.'  \n It was the first time I 'd really thought about her since I 'd heard the word from the padre. She was often out of sorts, but seriously ill was a bit much. \n Right through the war, she 'd written to John and me once a week. If there were other letters, Mother 's was opened last. I loved her, but there was never anything very interesting in a letter from a mother, except maybe the catalogue of casualties among the guys who 'd grown up with me. When her weekly letter had stopped about eight weeks earlier I 'd hardly noticed. \n On the other hand, I had written to her and to Bill just about every other day since February 1940, when I 'd enlisted. Mother used to tell me in her letters how much she and Bill looked forward to them.  'If your daddy was here he would be so proud of you, a pilot. I keep all your letters,'  she 'd say \n Writing letters was a compulsion with me. I had kept up contacts with other aircrew mates, as well. The educated ones never knew that by their letters they were educating me, sparking up my writing, lending to it the shine that Mother had liked so much. \n  'John 's home, too,'  Bill said. \n Lovely. Bloody lovely. \n  'He has no good word for you, Hugh. Never had, and he hasn't changed.' \n 'That doesn't surprise me.'  \n We turned the corner of the street, and the two old Nesbitt dames were at the door. I 'd forgotten about them, the Nesbitts, small and lonely, living their lives at the front door, one on a stool, the other leaning, arms folded, against the doorpost. Maudie, the elder sister, pointed as we appeared, and she and Agnes made squeaky noises of surprise and welcome. I took Agnes 's hand and made to do the same with Maudie, but she held me at arm 's length and peered up at me.  'You went away a boy, Hughie, but you 've come back a man that 's seen too much,'  she said. \n Bill had knocked the door and Maudie was kissing me when it opened. It was John. \n  'Huh. The Brylcreem boy 's home.'  \n With one glance he took an inventory, from top to toe. I could have done with a haircut; my tunic was wrinkled, the buttons tarnished. I needed a shave; my shoes were muddy and neglected. He gave another snort:  'The Household Cavalry!'  He turned away. No handshake, nothing. I followed him up the narrow hall, with its creaking, sagging floor. The joists and doorframe had never been the same since the 1941 air raids. In the tiny kitchen I felt oversized and awkward. Dropping my case beside the other one just inside the parlour, I hung my greatcoat over the banister. Before I had time to do anything else John called me:  'You 'd better come up.'  He was halfway up the stairs, looking down impatiently. I fell in behind him. He was in army undress, khaki shirt, trousers, and white canvas braces. Barrack-square creases angled through his broad backside; his boots had a high, bullshit shine. \n Aunt Nellie, Mother 's sister, was waiting outside the back bedroom. She kissed me, held me close, then she let me go and backed towards the front bedroom, out of the way. \n John spoke round the door of Mother 's room:  'Hugh 's home, Mother. He 's here.'  His voice was soft. With a jerk of the head I was invited to go in. \n A low-watt bulb shone weakly through an orange-tinted shade; yellow morning light filtered through an off-white paper blind, three-quarters drawn. The room was set for a dying. It was full of the scary-sweet bedpan smell of the deathbed. \nThe double bed filled most of the room. I walked around the end of it on the lino, past the tiny hearth, marking the places where Dad used to land his burning Woodbine butts. \n Mother, in a pink flannel nightdress and a woollen bed jacket, lay against high-heaped pillows. Her hair was soft, pinned back loosely. I dropped to my knees beside her. She was so weak that she couldn't turn her head towards me, only her eyes moved, and I bent over her, to make it easier. \n Her eyes were so sunken that the lids seemed to rest above them, out of contact. The skin was clapped tight to her skull. What had once been wrinkles were now lines drawn on parchment. \n I kissed her brow. It felt hot and dry. Her hands rested on the turned-down sheet and I took one in mine. She no longer had a bosom. \n Aunt Nellie had come into the bedroom. She stood, with John, at the door. She was Mother 's younger sister and she looked as Mother had looked the day I 'd left to go overseas - strong black hair, going grey, rolled-up sleeves, energy and bounce in every line of her.  'There now, Betty,'  she said,  'that 's Hugh home, too. They 're home to see you, your two lovely boys. And Hugh 's an officer and all.'  \n The lips fell back from the putty face; I had to bend to hear Mother 's voice.  'Aye.'  It was a whisper, fighting to get out of a sigh. \n  'Hello, Mother.'  I felt the stick fingers move in my hand. They searched along my own fingers, then came the voice again. \n  'Your ring?' \n 'It 's downstairs. I was washing myself and left it on the mantelpiece.'  As I spoke looked up. Bill had joined the others, but it was to John that my eyes went. His contempt was clear, for the lie about the ring. \n I stood up. The bedclothes had fallen away from her and I took the edge of the sheet to draw them up, but John 's voice stopped me:  'Watch it, for heaven 's sake, she 's in agony, can you not see that?'  \n I straightened, kissed her again, and followed John and Bill. Again I had the cloddish, clumsy feeling as I went back downstairs. I had forgotten how small the house was. The feel of it hadn't come back to me yet. \n Down in the kitchen I undid my tunic, hung it in the hall. Aunt Nellie handed me tea in one of the best china cups: Mother 's wedding present. The cup rattled and shook so much in my hand that some of the tea spilled into the saucer. I set them on the carpet and lit a cigarette. John and Bill and Aunt Nellie were watching. \n It was the woman who showed understanding, as I felt the sweat break.  'You must feel strange, back home again, after three years.'  \n I nodded, tried lifting the saucer again and made it. As I drained the tea I could feel John 's eyes going over me. \n  'What kind of job were you doing at Air HQ?'  Bill asked. He was ready to commit the details to memory for transmission at Canning Street corner that night. \n  'I was helping the Eyetie air force to re-form,'  I told him. \n  'Bunch of bloody ice-cream    sellers   ,' John growled. 'They were about as much good in the field as a troop of the Girl Guides.' \n  'Actually, their pilots weren't that bad,'  I said.  'It took a lot of nerve to fly some of the out-of-date kites that they had. Our fellows were knocking their SM 79s out of the sky with no bother, and their fighter pilots in the Machi 202s were no joke. They got a good few of ours.'  \n  'All the same, it 's great, you being an officer and all,'  Aunt Nellie was smiling shyly.  'It should help you to get a good job when you come out of the air force.'  \n  'I 'll tell you one thing,'  Bill said, enjoying John 's chagrin,  'you 'll not be going back to working in Short 's.'  \n I had been a paint-sprayer in the aircraft factory, but when war came I walked out. I just smiled at Bill and looked around the kitchen, at the china cabinet that was new, the scrubbed, bare table and the worn sofa that had been there for as long as I could remember, at the stool that Dad had made, and the four worn and scarred chairs around the table. The lino and rug were new. \n Just when she 'd begun to clear the house of the war 's shabbiness and lift her heart with some new items, Mother was going to die. \n  'What does the doctor say?'  I asked Aunt Nellie, knowing the answer already.\nShe shook her head as she spoke.  'There 's no betterment for your mother, Hugh . . .'  She dropped her head and wrung her hands.' . . .  No betterment at all.'  \n I went into the parlour to unpack. There was a brand-new suite of furniture in the room, some sort of fawn tweedy material; scatter cushions lay on the two chairs and the sofa, with larger cushions. A dark carpet had been laid, and over it a light fawn long-haired rug. Beside the door was another new china cabinet. In this, and in the one in the kitchen, were Mother 's most loved possessions, two china sets, an EPNS tray, trinkets and souvenirs of bygone trips with the Mothers ' Union, the swimming medals Dad had won as a young man, some cheap glasses, a decanter that had never seen wine or spirits, framed photographs of my grandparents, on both sides. There was a new bookcase, empty of books, beside the cabinet. On the mantelpiece two wooden elephants stood sentry, beside each was a brass candlestick, and in the centre was a clock with Westminster chimes. \n The parlour was looking nice. \n It was a rotten time for her to die. She was only fifty-nine.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "90cb891e-175b-41b7-be1f-b14c9842dbbd", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.702553+00:00"}
{"text": "<The General>\n\n\n<$A>\n Chapter One \n 1.45 a.m. 4 June 1993 \n LISBURN \n Charlotte Aitken snapped the worn leather cover over the luminous face of her watch, quickening her pace as she stepped out in the dark, irritated by the rain lashing across the narrow stone path through the heavy, dripping old pines.  'Damn this bloody country,'  she muttered.  'Weather like this in June for God 's sake!'  \n A dim blue lamp came on over the black glass door of the block as Charlotte removed her beret, spoke into the entryphone and turned her face to the camera. Inside, behind the lamp, an unseen Royal Pioneer Corps security guard flicked a switch, checking her voice against a tape marked with her name, her face against a computer-generated image of her salient features superimposed on the screen. He had no choices or judgements to make: the computer in an armoured safe did it for him. A green light on his panel indicated a good match to voice and face. The Pioneer moved to the next stage of the block 's entry procedures. \n  'Your hand, please.'  \n Charlotte watched a thin aluminium panel slide back to expose a convex glass shape set into the wall. She placed her left hand over it, lightly gripping the warm, smooth surface. The guard checked the computer; palm and fingerprints OK. He flicked two switches, on to deactivate the CS riot gas spray directly opposite Charlotte 's face, the other to activate an infra-red scanning camera and a set of movement sensors on the door side of the block. All clear. Finally he pressed the door switch. Half a ton of steel slid back into its slot in the wall behind the black glass, allowing Charlotte into the block, a windowless concrete cube with walls eight feet thick, coyly faced with pretty red brick and false windows in a surprisingly effective attempt to make it look like a standard army office building. Down in the bowels of the block, in the Intelligence Centre operations room Corporal Harry Green dropped a pink file marked SECRET over the spread legs of the 'Girl of the Month' and leapt to his feet as his brigadier stalked into the room, taking in everything in a long sweeping glance.  Shit, does that sodding woman never sleep?  \n  'Good morning Brigadier, what can I do for you Ma'am?'   'Anything from Bravo?'  Green thought the brigadier looked worried, but it was hard to tell what went on behind that beautiful, ruthless face.  'Nothing ma'am. He 's due to call in about now.'  \n  'I know that. Anything from the SAS or the Bessbrook operations room?'  Charlotte Aitken turned slightly, her weight on one foot, bringing the full force of her personality to bear on the young corporal. Green swallowed hard.  'Nothing much, ma'am. The Heregans are busy setting up a couple of observation posts to keep an eye on some unauthorised crossing points in Tyrone and the grunts are following their usual pattern in the area of concern, nothing anywhere close to our man. Why don't you take a bleeper and get some sleep, ma'am? I 'll call you if anything happens.'  \n The cold blue eyes warmed, seeming to lighten in colour, and the tall slim figure eased visibly as she glanced at the clock. A soft smile cracked the frost. 'Don't let the infantry hear you calling them grunts. And Heregans?' \n Green smiled in return.  'SAS. Hereford hooligans, ma'am. \n Again the smile, a little more strained as she checked the clock again.  'Very well, once he 's called in I 'll take a bleeper. Wake me for his six o'clock call. What 's in that file you 're reading, anything new?'  \n Green blanched.  'No, ma'am.'  \n  'Then why are you reading it? Let me see.'  She stepped over to the desk and lifted the file, dropping it instantly as she caught sight of the centrefold below it. She turned the magazine to a better angle, to get a better look. Green quailed. Brigadier Aitken was not an officer to be on the wrong side of: better men than he had found themselves booted out on their arses, their careers in tatters, without so much as a goodbye when they had failed to live up to her standards. \n The eyes were dark and chilling again, the cut glass voice lashing into him.  'I was not aware of your studies in gynaecology, Corporal. Get rid of this rubbish and concentrate on your duties.'  \n  'Yes, ma'am. I 'm sorry.'  \n  'Don't be sorry. Be professional. Anyone can make a mistake. You have had yours. I will not tolerate such dereliction of duty again. Am I understood?'  \n Green quivered with relief.  'Yes, Brigadier. It won't happen again.'  He moved to turn back to his desk but her eyes held him pinned. Her voice softened as her mind seemed to change gear.  'Corporal, there is a very brave man out there in the dark depending on you. You know that. If he needs you he will need you to act very quickly and he will need you to get it right first time. Be ready for him.'   Green felt his cheeks burn with embarrassment, furious with himself, furious at having to see the intensity in her eyes. He picked up the magazine and dropped it into the big, heavy duty shredder beside the desk. \n Both soldiers jumped as the voice burst out of the speakers set in the wall. It was exactly two o'clock.  'Zero, this is Bravo. No change, over.'  \n Corporal Green grabbed the telephone-type handset, depressing the SEND button with his thumb.  'Zero. No change. Ou ...'  Brigadier Aitken grabbed the handset.  'Bravo, this is Zero Nine. I am here if you need me, over.'  \n Green was shocked by the whiteness of her knuckles on the handset, the worry in her voice, the bend in her body as she seemed to pour the essence of herself into the ether, shocked at the break in procedure and her personal intervention. More than anything he was shocked by her tone. It was the tone he heard in his wife 's voice when his job took him into danger, when she was frightened for him. \n Again the voice from the wall, softer, less abrupt.  'Bravo. I know. It 's enough. Out.'  \n Charlotte Aitken dropped the handset and covered her face with her hands, her body in its combat suit and boots rigid. \n Suddenly, Corporal Green understood. He grabbed his message pad and wrote quickly, then held the pad out to her. He coughed to get her attention.  'My report, ma'am.'  His brigadier took the pad and read the latest in the list of radio reports between her headquarters and the man in the field. It was no different from the others, a five-second exchange recording No Change. \n Charlotte Aitken relaxed a little, looking carefully at Green.  'This is not a true . . .'  Green turned away.  'Beg pardon for interrupting you, Brigadier. That 's all I heard. Take the bleeper. Get some sleep. Leave Bravo with me. I 'll not let him down.'    Chapter Two \n 20 March 1953 \n ALDERSHOT, HAMPSHIRE \n  'Matron?'   'Speaking.'  \n  'Captain Helleston, Duty Midwife. We have a problem brewing here ma'am. A retired general and his son-in-law, a padre, the father to be. The gentlemen appear to be in some conflict. We need you to grip them before they disturb the mother . . . \n Mother and baby are well ma'am . . . A little girl . . . No, the gentlemen have not been told . . . The general may be difficult; he has been visiting and talking widely about his first grandson ma'am . . . I am grateful ma'am, ten minutes then. Goodbye.'  \n Major-General (Retd.) Alexander Hopkinson crushed the remnants of his cigar into the tall brass ashtray, grimacing at the nervous pacing of his son-in-law.  Twitching about like a bloody ballerina. Weak. No guts. Never had.   'Sit down, will you, Charles. Have some dignity.'  The Reverend Charles Aitken, his normal unhealthy pallor worsened by worry about his wife 's protracted labour rounded on the old general.  'Don't tell me how to behave, General. I 'm tired of your interference. Bessie is not strong. This could be too much for her.'  \n Anger and contempt darkened the general 's thin, almost ascetic face.  'Rubbish. Elizabeth is as strong as a mule. Producing babies is a perfectly normal female activity. It 's what women are for. Faffing about your parish drinking tea with a bunch of middle-aged hypochondriacs whining about the state of their nerves is no good for a daughter of mine. You should get off your arse and get a grip on your career. You 're nearly fifty and still a curate. You 're a failure, man. What Elizabeth ever saw in you I 'll never know.'  \n  'Will you never underst-'  Charles Aitken stopped in midsentence, jerking as a small, whip-thin lieutenant-colonel in the dawn-grey ward dress and scarlet tippet of the Queen Alexandra 's Royal Army Nursing Corps strode sharply into the waiting room. The colonel 's head-dress, a huge white linen diamond starched stiff as a breadboard, forced her to turn her whole body to survey the room. Competence and authority no mere man would even consider querying exuded from her every pore, matched and reinforced by a presence far greater than her physical size.  'Reverend Aitken? I am Charlotte Bruce-Adams, matron of this hospital. I am delighted to tell you that you have a lovely daughter, with all her fingers and toes and a powerful pair of lungs. Your daughter is a beautiful baby, strong and healthy. Mother is well, but a little tired. You can see them both tomorrow, when mother is ready to receive you.'  She smiled brightly.  'What 's your daughter 's name to be? My staff will need it for her identification label.'  \n Charles Aitken slumped into a chair, unable for the moment to speak, praying silently, giving thanks for the safe delivery and dreading the old general 's reaction. But the general was already on his feet.  'Daughter? A bloody daughter? I wanted a . . .'  He stopped himself and turned on the hunched figure of Charles Aitken.  'I might have expected it, you worthless creeping Jesus. Not enough balls to give my girl a son, damn you. You 're despicable, Aitken, useless God-bothering half excuse for a man. I have a bloody good mind to . . .'  The QA colonel, ready for but still horrified at the scene, decided to take command immediately. \n  'General! You will compose yourself, sir! How dare you behave in this way in my hospital. I must, with respect, remind you that I command here, not you: I will not hesitate to have you removed forthwith if you persist in such unbecoming conduct. I trust that, when calmer, you will be thoroughly ashamed of yourself. Reverend Aitken, you will give your little girl a name, now.'  \n The Reverend Aitken did not move or utter a sound. General Hopkinson, watching closely, saw his chance for lifetime dominance, be it boy or girl. He fought his fury as he clamped both hands around his ashplant stick and spoke at first through clenched teeth, easing as the words came.  'Thank you, Matron. I forgot myself, please forgive me. This is Queen Charlotte 's Hospital. The girl 's father is Charles. Your own name is Charlotte. On the other hand you wear Queen Alexandra 's Cross and I am Alexander. Charlotte wins three to two. I see no reason to tempt fate. Charlotte it is. I will arrange to have the girl christened as such at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, in due time.'  \n Lieutenant-Colonel Charlotte Bruce-Adams, appalled at the general 's callous indifference to any preference the baby 's parents might have switched her attention to the Reverend Aitken, who was still sitting silent, with his head down. She expected some sign of anger or objection from him, why she did not know: the padre had not spoken a word since she had entered the room.  Maybe the general is right. Maybe Aitken is a nonentity.  The soldier in her sided with the general, preferring positive action of some kind to no action of any kind, but her voice was edged with her irritation with both men.  'Very well, General. I will convey to your daughter your joy in baby Charlotte. A warning: I will not tolerate a repeat of this disgraceful scene in Mrs Aitken 's hearing. You may visit her of course, but I direct that you and the Reverend Aitken do so separately. I am extremely disappointed in having to issue such a distasteful order, but you should not doubt that I will enforce it. Gentlemen, you should both be proud of the way Mrs Aitken has borne up throughout a long and difficult confinement. She has presented you with a fine, healthy baby. Be thankful for that. Good day to you.'", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ab45f139-73dc-4f22-8e8d-0146b1295707", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.704035+00:00"}
{"text": "<Fat Lad>\n\n\n<$A>\n Goldfish? My granny had a goldfish once. It drowned. \n The crack that lost him his virginity. Indirectly. A dreadful joke, if joke you could even call it, for there was no more to it than that: a drowning goldfish and a Northern Irish voice. And it was the voice, raucous above the babble, turned her head in the first instance, before the image congealed and made her smile and she began her evening-long drift round the tables of the Union bar towards its source. He watched her approach, knowing full well what lay ahead, amazed at how easy it was, when it came to the bit, to make the little betrayal in pursuit of success:  it 's the way I tell them;  the green and white minstrel. Amazed too, though not for the first time since arriving in England a fortnight before, at the unexpected effects of this thing coming from his mouth, this Belfast accent, his sister 's childhood nightmare. A stigma turned distinction. \n Hours later, after last orders at the bar and drinks in someone 's room and a smoke in someone else 's, after faltering sex by the light of a reading lamp turned to the wall, it was the voice she came back to: \n I could just lie here all night listening to you talk, she said, confirming what he had already thought, while putting the dampener on any hopes he might have had of trying to improve on his initial, dismal, coital efforts. \n Her name was Kelly Thorpe, a languages student from Leicester:  though my great-grandparents on my mother 's side were from Ireland, which is where I get Kelly.  At Christmas she sent him a card in Belfast, with an airmail sticker in the top left-hand corner of the envelope. But by that time, the compromises of his fresher weeks long forgotten, he had fallen in with the Ex-Pats, a group of jaundiced exiles, sworn to renounce their birthplace and all its works, and Kelly 's misconception about the countries ' postal relations was no more ludicrous to him than the posturings of the earnest boys who stood every Thursday on the steps of the Union building, with their Harringtons, number one crewcuts, and armfuls of  Troops Out  papers, bellowing in best Home Counties accents: Support the revolution in Ireland! \n Hugh McManus, final year law, guiding light and  ex-iest  of all the Ex-Pats, had harangued them, solo, one famous rainy Thursday, challenging them to define their terms - What revolution? What  Ireland  ? - and cutting to pieces each glib formulation with a flourish of his free hand (for one or other of Hugh 's hands was invariably entangled in the straps of a garish and voluminous vinyl shopping bag), till they, their hair sticking up like a teddy bear 's sucked fur and the thighs of their jeans wet where the rain had coursed down off the plastic sheets protecting the papers, were reduced to shouts of  Paisleyite  ! and  Fascist  ! Hugh McManus. The son of Belfast 's foremost Catholic solicitors. The brilliant Hugh McManus, shot to death last year at age twenty-nine by a gunman, or gunmen, unknown, following his successful defence of Father Fiacc, the Liverpool priest (dubbed Father Fear by the tabloids) accused of plotting to assassinate the Environment Secretary on a visit to a Merseyside garden f&/\\ete. \n Drew looked at his reflection, double-exposed (speccy eight-eyes) in the aeroplane window. Where did Hugh come from all of a sudden? The lips in the window rewound at speed and tracked in on the word goldfish. That bloody goldfish. Eight years and more after he could last remember having given it a thought, it had turned up in his dreams the previous night and was still there when he awoke this morning, going round and round in his brain as monotonously and pointlessly as it had used to in its bowl. \n Grandpa Linden, who Drew knew only from photographs and yarns such as this, had brought the goldfish home with him a month or two before he died. \n - Where 'd you get it? granny asked.  - A wee man Big Alec knows is selling them cheap. \n There was always some wee man Big Alec knew selling something cheap. No questions asked, of course. Grandpa Linden asked none then, but from the day and hour it came into the house it was clear to his wife that that goldfish was never bred for life in a bowl. \n - They 're special strain, grandpa hazarded. From Africa. From somebody 's pond up the Antrim Road, more like, she said, peering at the thing through cloudy water. \n It was huge. Even at that early stage swimming backwards and forwards was out: round and round was all it could manage, or every once in a while, with a huge splosh as it performed a laborious about-turn, round and round in the opposite direction. \n - We can't leave it in there, it 'll die. \n But they did and it didn't; not for a good many years anyway and certainly not in the way Drew 's grandmother had in mind. But then, who ever heard of a fish drowning? Or rather, to give the thing its proper name,  being drowned?  For even when the goldfish finally did go (early April, mid-seventies, while Granny Linden took an Easter week in Portrush), it did not go of its own free will. Drew had pushed open the bathroom door one evening to find his sister Ellen kneeling on the oval mat, her arms plunged into the bathwater and the empty bowl on the lino beside her. She turned her eyes towards him briefly, then looked away into the water. \n Get out, Drew, was all she said and when he saw her next she was at the boxroom window, pressing her face to the glass, causing ripples of mist to expand and contract about the imprint of her lips. Again and again, expanding and contracting, till the curtains were yanked together and the ripples contracted one final time in a slow-dying grin. \n The  fasten seat-belt  command pinged red as the plane emerged from the mizzle and banked right, putting stern dark hills between itself and the lough shore on the descent into Aldergrove. And only then did Drew accept what was happening. Only then, despite everything that had gone before in the six chaotic weeks since he had read of the vacancy on the staffroom noticeboard - the letter of application, written on an impulse, then and there, the interview, the discussions, turning to rows, with Melanie, even the week-long visit to arrange a flat the month before (his first visit in four years and the only one since he graduated not occasioned by a funeral); all had been conducted in a bubble of unreality which popped now with the drop in cabin pressure. \n The plane roared in towards the runway, hitting the tarmac with a bump. Impact of incompatibles. It reared up, as though affronted.  Forget it,  Drew felt like saying.  Let 's turn round.  But even while the thought was forming the plane was adjusting its speed and the second time there was no bump and he was back. \n Only a year, he promised himself. Only a year. \n No one was watching for him from the viewing tower, because no one knew to expect him. Drew took renewed heart from his foresight in not phoning ahead. Start as you mean to go on. The less he depended on the family the better. He was nearly twenty-seven, after all, and well used to looking out for himself. He had come back, he thought now, and he hadn't  come back  . For how could he be said to have returned to something that wasn't there before? The Belfast he left, the Belfast the Ex-Pats forswore, was a city dying on its feet: cratered sites and hunger strikes; atrophied, self-abased. But the Belfast he had heard reports of this past while, the Belfast he had seen with his own eyes last month, was a city in the process of recasting itself entirely. The army had long since departed from the Grand Central Hotel, on whose levelled remains an even grander shopping complex was now nearing completion. Restaurants, bars and takeaways proliferated along the lately coined Golden Mile, running south from the refurbished Opera House, and new names had appeared in the shopping streets: Next, Body Shop, Tie Rack, Principles. And his own firm, of course, Bookstore. \n The doors opened on the arrivals lounge and a notice welcomed passengers no longer to Aldergrove, but to Belfast International Airport. \n A groan rippled down the queue as they saw the size of the bus pulling in, a small nineteen-seater. \n - Imagine sending a Flexibus, the woman behind Drew said, making  Flexi  rhyme with taxi, so that Drew wondered whether subconsciously she had established some analogy between function and pronunciation. \n - All aboard the Pope-mobile, her friend said. \n The bus driver fended off the jibes with a shrug of his shoulders. It was always the same when an English flight came in, never enough cover. \n - All 's I do 's drive them, he said. \n He wore gold-framed aviator sunglasses (though it was the middle of February) and rested a foot on the low dashboard as he dispensed the tickets: white sock, maroon shoe. \n There 'll be another one in half an hour, he said through the closing folding door when the bus was full. \n - Half an hour 's a lot of bloody use to me, a man with two children said and the driver shrugged again. \n Drew, who had made sure he was at the head of the queue, snuggled down in his seat, closing his eyes and wedging his knees against the seat in front. Just as the bus moved off, however, the person beside him stood to let an old man sit down. Drew had seen him earlier at the baggage collection point, smiling at everyone - his smile an erosion in the folds of his face - and marked him down as one to avoid. \n - That 's no day to be standing around outside, the old man said now and rubbed his thick purple hand together. They made a rasping sound like the pages of antique books. \n - Just visiting? he asked. \n It was as Drew had feared: a talker. He thought despondently of the long drive into town. \n Business, he said, turning to the window. An off-putting word spoken in what he hoped was an off-putting manner. \n But it was the worst thing he could have said. The old man took him for English and insisted on glossing the entire journey with his comments.\n - This here 's a checkpoint, he said, when the bus slowed by a sign saying  Vehicle Checkpoint;  and a bit later, indicating the winter-stripped fields to the right and left of the road: We 're in the country yet. \n Drew tried telling him that he was Belfast born and bred himself, but the old man wore a hearing aid and only smiled his canyon smile and nodded while Drew spoke, then turned in his seat the second he was finished to point out some house or other they had just passed, and Drew gave up explaining. \n Where the M2 curved across the Shore Road below Whitewell and levelled out for the run-in to the city centre, his neighbour shook him yet again by the sleeve. \n Here 's a thing here 'll get you, he said. See the whole of this stretch of road. See years ago? Even twenty years ago, I mean, even  ten  : All underwater. Would you credit it? Underwater. \n He chuckled to himself, then stopped abruptly. His redrimmed lids blinked a bleary film over the surface of his eyes. \n - Ah, boy, you could have fished out here and everything once upon a time, he said and Drew watched, horrified, as tears teetered on his eyelashes and plashed on the purple, rasping hands. \n Drew appealed mutely to the people standing in the aisles, but they were all engrossed in newspapers and magazines. What could he do? He did what he always did in such circumstances: unhooked his specs from behind his ears, wipe-wipe-wiped them on a pulled-down sleeve kept unbuttoned for that very purpose, put them on, took them off, put them on again; then in desperation he pushed a Kleenex into one of the aged fists and faced the window once more. \n - God spare me this old man 's double vision, he prayed. \n What is is all. \n And at that point he saw the road swell magnificently to ten lanes then burst into splinters: Bangor, Docks, Newtownards, City Centre, Westlink, M1, The West. \n It was already dark by the time he reached the flat. There was a Telecom package waiting for him at the end of the landing by the front door. He dragged his suitcase inside and ripped open the padded envelope containing his new Viscount phone. The line had been reconnected that morning, though he had quite a hunt before he found the socket - in the passage between the kitchen and living-room, of all places. He 'd need a wall bracket. He sloughed the polythene wrapping off the handset and called Melanie. No reply. Friday evening. She 'd be doing her shopping. He remembered he 'd nothing in himself and wondered what to do about dinner. Phone out for something. But not yet. After reading the instruction leaflet for the central heating he set the thermostat and went into the bedroom to stretch out on the cold mattress. He woke at midnight and tried Melanie again. Still no answer. He fetched his specs and looked to see where the wall bracket would go, then decided it was too late now to eat. He made up the bed with the bedding he had bought last month and got inside. The smell made him dream he had fallen asleep in a department store.  \n Melanie balanced her glass on the arm of the chair and sucked a thread of lemon from between her teeth. Drunk. Good and drunk. Good, good. She let the phone ring. Good for me. She crossed the room for the gin, passing the hi-fi and starting a record up with her foot. The stylus bounced twice, like a stone on black water, before coming to rest in the middle of a track. He 'd have a fit if he could hear that.  Dead  scared. She kicked the turntable and the pick-up skited sideways. A zip being undone. Plus applause. The phone stopped ringing. Good again. Good riddance to bad rubbish. She sat on one of the cardboard boxes clumped in the centre of the room. It sagged and for some reason that made her snigger, which in turn made her sink further inside, so that her bum settled on the boards of his hoarded notebooks, and she laughed louder and louder, laughed till she thought she would cry. \n She had left the theatre early this afternoon to pack his things. He hadn't asked her, didn't know; she 'd just decided on the spur of the moment. She was fucked if she was going to look at his leavings every day. Tomorrow they could go down into the cellar until such times as he sent for them. For so far as she was concerned, when he got on the plane today that was that. It wasn't as if she hadn't told him. From the minute - the second - the millisecond - he mentioned it she 'd told him. But he insisted: it was only for a year; in a year he 'd be a manager and have his own shop. . . . Of course he would, and she knew where too: Derry, or Londonderry, whatever it was he called it, or some other miserable hole over there. And all that big talk there 'd been through the summer of branches in Paris and Rome. For a moment she almost felt sorry for him. The first assistant manager 's position to fall vacant and it had to be there. Even Dublin wouldn't have been so bad. But she quickly banished all such conciliatory thoughts. He could have waited. Another post would have come along sooner or later. \n A pair of tailor 's dummies stood back to back in the corner by the window. Two mud-brown velveteen lollies licked into approximate human shapes (the prototypes on which her occasional freelance creations were modelled), locked in a struggle they were powerless to resolve. \n She got out of the box and returned to her chair, pouring herself another drink.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "28cce50e-ca4f-4573-96e1-0b5733b49eaa", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.705064+00:00"}

In a place dedicated to creativity, the stove was the only thing that lived, squatting black and superior in the empty kitchen. \n I am alive, says the stove. When no one is looking, I confess, I have hugged my stove. \n But that is only because you have gone, Jude, leaving me with stoves and visions. \n I had a vision of the future last night, a future in which we could become a hologram of ourselves making love. \n There could be three of me, plunging into every place, or five. \n Or two of you. \n It is my fear, Jude, to see a women being made love to by many men. \n It is my fear, that it is always you I imagine. \n You, who almost drove me mad with your sweet aversion to fucking. \n What is the colour of fucking? \n A dark and bitter red. \n What is the colour of Jude? \n The colour of innocence, covered with new dust. \n What is the colour of these eggs I am boiling on my black stove? \n The colour of swollen bellies, waiting. \n What is the colour of the bottle of thawing champagne sitting on the old table? \n The colour of Jack Nicholson 's smile, all sweet evil and glee. \n What is the colour of the table? \n The colour of uncertain good. Everything is uncertain tonight, and perhaps I do know perhaps after all. \n But all these colours add up to hope, Jude. \n Hope that I will hear your voice tonight, as if down the telephone from a distant land, telling me that my ticket is on its way. My ticket out of this fiefdom of tasteless dwarves to the land of tall and nobler people for which I have long awaited my visa. \n In this land of one-eyed kings, only the blind are free. \n So let us be blind to the past tonight, so that instead of our conversation tilting away into the doomed monologues that conversations became in the last days of our marriage, it will free me from the agony of hope that eats at me now. \n Hope that you will hitch your shoulders and stretch, and I will ask you if your back is troubling you again. \n That you will finish your glass and set it down, and in the breathing silence I will look out of the window to where the garden meets the trees, and ask you if you would like me to rub a little oil into your back. \n That you will give me one of your knowing, sardonic expressions. The slightly amused version. \n  'No, I don't think so,'  you will say. \n  'Just a shoulder?'  \n That you will shake your head, tapping your cigarette into the ashtray we brought back from Amsterdam, as I refill your glass. \n  'Neck? An ear lobe?'  \n That you will feign resignation.  'Would you like to see my new Panama?'  \nThat you will mime a tipsy despair.  'All right. But it 's very dangerous.'  \n That I will lead you up to our old bedroom, my heart shaking the stairs. \n Where are you, Jude? \n It is the evening, and still you are not here. \n I hope you are not late because you are angry. The thought of an evening again sitting across the loaded table is more than I can bear. \n I have put some butter in with the eggs, to keep them moist through the shells, easing it off the knife and down into the winded water, melting there like the age-yellow shroud of a madonna, haloed by silvery bubbles of fat. \n Now the eggs are steaming, fogging the window the way memory draws a veil across the past, and on the chopping board a mushroom lies beside the knife. \n It is the evening, Jude, and the light is growing dim upon this table. It is the wise time of the day, and the fire in the other room is not quite lit, so that it seems there is no connection between the black surface of the coal and the flames that dance across it. \n I worry, Jude, that you were the flames and I was always the coal. \n I worry, too, that in the year since you left me, I have grown old. \n That although my body is young, an oldness is creeping into it. \n At the back of my left calf a clump of veins bubbles under the white skin, and my hands, blue turning blotched purple in cold weather, are the hands of my father. \n An oldness creeps into my clothes, into the brogues which I spent the afternoon saddlesoaping. I allowed them to dry, then buffed the uppers into an amateur paradeground gleam. \n Now they are beneath the table, their softened gleam shining nuttily up. \n I confess, Jude, that when no one is looking I love my brogues. \n Where are you, Jude? \n It is the night, and it is raining. \n There was a November once, when we were not long married, when I stood by the coalshed thinking of the music the rain made, because I knew that when I went back you would be in front of the fire in the other room. \n I thought often in those days of us being in some foreign land of our own invention, some unnamed northern country where no one could touch us. \n And that night, as I stood there in the dark with the rain on the coalshed roof, with the sound of coffee slowly getting ready, with the rain dripping cold on the crown of my head, it could have been the thaw in a land like that, with spring almost over us and summer like a field stretching to autumn 's far hedge. \n I do not want to cross that hedge into another winter alone, looking at other men 's wives and burning for your beauty. \n Because I know now that there are women whom everyone thinks are beautiful, and whom you can see are beautiful, but who do not make you burn. \n After a time you cannot love women like that. \n There are women whom you think are beautiful, but whose beauty no one else sees. \n After a time you cannot love women like that. \n There are women you think are beautiful from the moment you meet them, and who the world thinks beautiful too. \n They are the ones who seek out madness, in themselves and others. \n What I wanted from you, Jude, was a little sanity, a little binding of wounds, a little salvation. \n What I wanted from you, Jude, was for you to be the fourth woman. \n What is the colour of the fourth woman? \n A dark and bitter innocence, covered with new dust. \n The colour of your shoes, which you promised that you would wear today. \n But where are you, Jude. \n Tap. \n I am drunk, Jude. \n I have opened the champagne, and the rain has stopped falling from the frozen, methylated sky. \n Drunk, I have put on my old black suit and shoes, a white shirt and a black bow tie, and I am sitting here at the table, drinking champagne and reading Antoine de Saint-Exup&/ery. \n I am drunk, Jude. I think I am Antoine 's co-pilot, descending into the jasmine and cicada whirr of small desert towns, our breath frosting against the studded aqua sky and our sheepskin flying jackets bulky about us. \n And among those thoughts, tiny misplaced thoughts keep spinning up like rocks thrown by our wheels: of my mother wiping a smear of oil from my cheek with her handkerchief, of the false, indoor smells of lipstick and cigarette smoke of it. \n In this little dream within a dream, the smell of oil becomes the laborious, working smell of men, and the smell of the handkerchief becomes the smell of woman, of the glittering, faraway surface of all things. \n When Antoine and I land we taxi jauntily up to the hangar and there is Biggles standing, half in the light. \n  'Hello,'  he says as we climb down.  'Still got all my first editions?' \n 'Of course,'  I laugh. \n He offers a cigarette, but I will not take it. His hands are fine-boned and effeminate, and I wonder then where I read that first. \n Why are you not here, Jude? And what is that tapping from the door, when I cut the tree back last winter? Or was it the winter before? \n You will be here, Jude, before the morning comes. I do not care how long you take, because there is no anger in me any more. \n There is only the hope that you will arrive this night, wearing your bitter red shoes, so that we can stand in the clearing haze of morning, our feet firm beneath us. \n That you will make heaven of this night, Jude, and bring the beauty of this earth into the day. \n But I am drunk, Jude. I even wish you would come back and help me choose different curtains for the other room. \n Tap; tap. \n What is that noise? \n It is the morning, Jude, and you have not come. \n I have just awakened this minute, slumped over the table in the ether dawn. What is the colour of the dawn? \n I do not know. \n What is the colour of that sound, from beyond the door? \n Black my clothes, and black my feet. \n What is the colour of the door? \n I cannot remember. \n What is the colour of the shoes, which swing before me as I open the door? \n A dark and bitter red. \n Tap; tap. \n What is the colour of that sound? \n The colour of your death. \n  'There is a process,'  said Smith,  'using a rich green with tiny flecks of gold. It 's very expensive, but very sumptuous in . . . discreet, expansive way.'  \n  'Mmm,'  said the lawyer, who was trying to work out how something could be expansive and discreet at the same time. \n  'Like your suit,'  said Smith. The lawyer was wearing a pure wool Prince of Wales check chosen for him by his wife. \n  'Mmm,'  said the lawyer, who considered his suit expansive, but not quite discreet. \n  'We want every part of the house different,'  said the lawyer 's wife. \n  'There 's a beautiful northern light on that staircase which I think demands it,'  said Smith. \n  'Mmm,'  said the lawyer. \n  'Of course we can afford it, dear,'  said the lawyer 's wife. \n I love screwing the lawyer even more than I love screwing the lawyer 's wife, thought Smith. \n  'Mmm,'  said the lawyer. \n Smith jumped, sure that the lawyer had heard what he thought. \n The lawyer 's wife gave him a strange look.  'What about the carpet?'  she said. \n  'Marrakech blue,'  said Smith, who was thinking of a famous house he had seen in the desert, in one of his Biggles dreams. \n  'Really?'  said the lawyer, surprising the three of them. \n  'I know just the thing,'  said Smith.  'It will be perfect.'  \n  'I suppose it will,'  said the lawyer 's wife.  'It always is.'  \n Smith looked at the lawyer. Unless you looked at the lawyer regularly, it was easy to forget what he looked like. In fact, even now that Smith was looking at him, he would have been hard pressed to describe him. \n What colour was the lawyer 's face? \n The colour of all lawyers ' faces which manage to be both unhealthily flushed and unhealthily pale at the same time. The colour of most faces, in the land of the tasteless dwarves. \n What colour was the lawyer himself? \n No colour at all. \n  'Of course, we can afford it, dear,'  said the lawyer 's wife, laying stresses down gently in all the right parts of her sentence. \n  'Mmm,'  said the lawyer. \n Of course they could Smith always recommended the most expensive materials, which made him very popular with the sort of people who pay to have their houses designed. \n But Smith had done very little work since the day he found Jude. Just enough to live on, and barely that. \n His dreams of anarchy had almost gone, leaving him a spear-carrier in the cruel empire of other people 's homes.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ee68b3f1-0d84-46ac-966a-1fcb49cae47e", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.706603+00:00"}
{"text": "<Walking Corpses>\n\n\n<$A>\n Prologue \n Children with dirty faces smiled back at him. Their eyes gleamed in the light of the flames. A beautiful girl with thick dark clusters of curls hanging down to her shoulders was singing in Irish, unaccompanied. She just stood by the bonfire, there in the middle of the street, in the middle of a Catholic slum that for the last three nights had been under siege from gangs of Protestants, her voice rising above the crackling fire, and sang. And there was silence. The gangs of men and youths who had spilled from the corner pub to the pavement outside fell silent. The youths who had been laughing and joking at the makeshift barricade a little further up the street, they too fell silent, laying aside their sticks and clubs. It seemed as if the whole war-torn city was listening in the hope that her words would assuage its ugly wounds. \n Four days before, Mickey Burns was standing on the pavement of Manhattan carrying a suitcase, waiting for a cab to take him to Kennedy Airport for the bonfire, enraptured, though he didn't understand a word of what she sang. Neither did his cousin, Tofer Curry, who sat next to him, sipping from a beer can. But somehow Mickey understood what the song meant more clearly than he had understood anything in his life before, or perhaps since. \n Both cousins were weary. Three nights in a row they 'd been up without sleep. There 'd been riots, mobs rampaging in the streets, a nine year old boy murdered in his bedroom, others cut down on the road. The barricades were everywhere, blocking off the entrances to the warren of narrow side streets that made up the heart of the Falls Road Catholic ghetto. \n Mickey had come for a holiday, to stay with his cousin Christopher  \"Tofer\"  Curry. Instead, he 'd never worked so hard in his life - not even in Vietnam. He helped erect barricades, patched up injuries; had even given an on-the-spot arms lesson to someone said to be in the IRA who 'd shown up with a Second World War carbine left over from some long forgotten campaign. And everyone knew him as  \"The Yank\"  . The women made him cups of tea and sandwiches and asked him what he thought of this place, and wouldn't he rather have stayed in New York? And the children with dirty faces and bright eyes followed him around asking him if he knew where Clint Eastwood lived, and if when he returned could he hide them away in his suitcase? \n Since the barricades had been put up, the streets had come alive. There were bonfires, and the pubs never shut; impromptu dances were held at the corners and around the fires. All of the ghetto 's life spilled onto its pavements; the dourness, the sullen boredom of ghetto existence was swept away, people seemed to have shaken off the years of resentful obedience to hated authority. The very atmosphere was heady and electric with crackling rebellion. \n She sang, and he fell in love. He did not know her name. He had never seen her before. He did not know from where she had emerged, nor to where she had gone. When she had finished and stepped out of the light of the fire and into the surrounding shadows, she vanished. But for the duration of that song, sad yet defiant, she was the embodiment of an experience that Mickey Burns would treasure for the rest of his life. An experience that had bound him to his cousin who was at his side for those unforgettable days, and through that profound blood-link he was joined forever to the city from whence his own people had come and whose suffering he had witnessed for himself. \n She sang, and the whole city listened. But with the coming of morning, it resumed its murderous ways. \n And Mickey would return to New York again, not knowing how it would end. \n 1 \n Dawn came with the promise of a good bright summer 's day. It was so quiet that the sound of the traffic signals could be heard clicking from the far side of the road. Green, orange red, green, orange, red to the empty road, idiotically busy, like chorus girls dancing in an abandoned theatre. Not one car had passed in hours. \n Christopher Curry had not slept all night but felt wide awake. He had seen other dawns like this, crouched behind a rock overlooking a lonely road, waiting as now. Or years before, before the burnings, the barricades, the bombings; walking along a deserted road somewhere in England hoping only for the first car of the morning to come to thumb a lift. Such summer dawns always gave him a sensation of almost infinite optimism. The first car he thumbed would be certain to stop and take him to where he wanted to go. \n He looked at his watch, and then at Tohill, whose face as usual was expressionless. Next to him, McCann was slumped in a corner near the window. \n  \"A great day for the shore\"  , McCann said with a sigh. \n  \"Can you swim?\"  Christopher Curry asked Tohill, who shook his head. \n  \"Aye - like a brick,\"  he said. \n The queer smell of burning rubber and petrol that hung in the air over West Belfast had filtered into the room. It mingled with the stale smell of cigarette smoke. \n  \"I can swim,\"  said Curry,  \"but I wouldn't go near the beaches around here.\"  \n  \"Tofer 's a man for the Costa del Sol,\"  McCann said, smiling. \n  \"He wishes,\" said Tohill. \n A little later a car came along and stopped at the junction. They listened to its engine ticking over. Then a milk cart rattled down the road on its morning delivery. The lights flashed red. It halted. \n  \"I'm surprised,\"  Christopher Curry said,  \"after last night 's riots that they let it come into the area.\"  \n  \"They know it won't be touched,\"  said Tohill.  \"The families need the milk.\"  \n  \"What if it stops here?\"  Curry asked, his eyes darting suddenly from the milk lorry to Tohill. \n  \"It won't. I checked with the ould ones last night when we took over. They shop down the road. They don't take deliveries now. Relax.\"  \n After that a bread van came trundling towards the lights, full of freshly baked loaves, scones, baps and various cakes in long wooden trays. Christopher wondered if it would make the light But it was the third in a row that had to stop. He glanced at his watch again. They were due soon. Would they make it four? \n McCann roused himself and checked everything. Tohill told Curry to make sure that McAreevy, who was guarding the old couple, had everything under control. He found them still safely out of the way in the locked back room. \n  \"They 're sleeping like logs,\"  he told Tohill on his return.  \"McAreevy says they 've been no problem.\"  \n A baby 's cry drew the three men 's attention back to the road. They tensed. A young woman was pushing a big baby carriage down the sidewalk, heading in the direction of the traffic lights. It was a Cadillac of a pram - the kind young mothers buy to show off their first baby. \n She stopped and stuck her head into the pram. The baby was howling. It must have lost its dummy tit or something. What the hell was she doing out at this hour anyway, Curry asked himself. Tohill was pale, and kept checking the time. They were usually so punctual. \n Both McCann and Curry looked at Tohill. He kept staring down the road. It was too late to back out now. \n The baby stopped crying. The mother pushed the pram along more quickly. They heaved a sigh of relief. But when she reached the lights she halted. She began to push the pram off the curb, but as its back wheels hit the road she hesitated. \n The sound of a vehicle made them all look left. They were coming. Tohill took a deep breath and squatted down, McCann beside him, ready to feed the belt of bullets into the M-60 general purpose machine gun. Christopher shoved up the front window. A breeze blew in, wafting up the curtains, intensifying the stink of melted rubber and burnt petrol. \n A British army landrover came racing towards the light. Christopher raised his rifle to his shoulder. The lights turned orange. \n  \"The bastard 's tryin' to make the light,\"  he whispered. The signal flashed red. The vehicle braked hard. Four in a row, Curry smiled to himself. \n  \"What 's the fuckin' rush, Sarge? Goin' to see your lady friend?\"  one of the squaddies in the back shouted in a thick Birmingham accent. \n The driver had just waved the woman across the street when the first burst of Tohill 's M-60 punctured the landrover 's side, tearing out gaping metal craters. A soldier fell backwards onto the road, his side a mess of blood. Two others tumbled after him as Tohill raked the vehicle once more, splitting the driver 's head like a coconut halved by the blow of a machete. Curry fired again and again into the confused, panic-stricken group. One soldier was sent spinning onto the pavement as easily as a broken doll. \n The young mother 's screams could be heard above the groans of the wounded and dying man. The baby was howling again. From somewhere above it all came the noise of a helicopter. \n They dismantled the M-60 rapidly and made for the stairs. As Curry left his post, he glimpsed the woman and her pram. Her hands were in front of her face. The pram was splashed with the driver 's blood and brains. \n At the back of the house the car and the delivery truck were waiting, their engines throbbing. Two men dressed in blue overalls opened the truck 's back doors as Tohill and McCann threw in the machine gun. Then, putting on overalls themselves, the M-60 operators climbed in. The truck was soon reversing down the alley. \n Curry opened the car 's back door and concealed the dismantled armalite in the hidden compartment built into the floor. \n The young woman who was at the wheel waited for him to jump in beside her. He hardly recognised her as the Deirdre Duggan he knew. Her hair was cropped short and she was dressed like a mousy office girl. The short hair made her eyes look larger and brighter. \n They drove towards the far end of the alley and then turned a wide and leafy street. She was calm, unhurried. \n  \"I heard a woman scream,\"  she said. \n He nodded.  \"No problem. She wasn't hit.\"  \n  \"Thank fuckin' Jasus for that,\"  Deirdre said under her breath. \n Christopher glanced out the window. A British army helicopter was hovering above the street. \n  \"The fuckers have spotted us,\"  he exploded. \n Deirdre accelerated. Immediately there was a boom and the back windscreen disintegrated, showering them with fragments of glass. An army and police patrol was closing behind their car, a sharpshooter standing up, his rifle trained on them for a second shot. \n  \"Right at the junction.\"  Christopher told her. She swung the car on the main road. The helicopter was now slightly ahead of them and banking in their direction. A short distance up ahead was an old abandoned factory. Its entrance was a rusting ramshackle gate.  \"There\"  he said pointing to it. \n She gave him a perplexed glance. \n  \"There 's a way out the back onto the next road.\"  he explained. In the side mirror he saw the patrol vehicle turn onto the main road and come after them.  \"We 'll dump the car inside.\"  \n  \"But the gear?\"  \n  \"Fuck the gear!\"  \n Deirdre swerved right off the road. The car bumped up the little cobblestoned entrance way and collided with the gate. There was a crunching thud as the car smashed through. \n They were in a narrow yard. On either side were warehouses, storerooms and high-ceilinged winding rooms; all were empty. There were large puddles of water where the rain had poured down through gaping holes in the roofs. \n  \"Get out,\"  he ordered. \n  \"But ....\"  \n  \"Go straight ahead, then make a sharp left at the foot of the yard. There 's an old office workers ' entrance at the back. It opens out on Mill Lane.\"  \n  \"But you ....\"  she insisted. \n  \"I 'll keep them busy. Now hurry, for fuck 's sake!\"  He reached over and opened her door. She heard a police siren. \n Deirdre jumped out. Christopher followed her, but went to the back of the car. As she disappeared down the yard towards the rear entrance, he took the rifle from the compartment and ran into the winding room. \n The damp heavy smell of flax still lingered in the air. His mother had worked in this factory years ago when he was a boy. Then it had bustled with mill girls. They always fussed over him because of his mop of curly black hair. His mother was dead and the mill girls were long gone, their winding looms turned to junk. Now the floors were covered in pigeon shit. It was a dead, dank place, like his past and the world he knew. \n So this would be the spot - the place of his very own Alamo, where he would enter the realms of Republican martyrology. \n Outside, the Brits braked sharply, and the roar of the descending helicopter shook the factory and made in rattle like a pile of old bones.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "180ad296-50d2-4673-a656-914f72255671", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.707644+00:00"}
{"text": "<Sweet Killough>\n\n\n<$A>\n ONE \n PICTURES KEEP TUMBLING out of the filing cabinet of memory. Are they real? Or are they echoes of stories told or conversations half overheard? Or the whisperings and gossip of adults? Or the fantasy of a child surrounded by other children with active imaginations? \n Sitting on Daddy 's shoulders coming down the Chapel Brae after first mass on a Christmas morning. It is dark - mass must have been at about six or seven o'clock. There are no streetlamps, but the lights in windows and through open doors all down the street to the corner are bright enough for navigation. The air, sharp and cold. The sky, perfectly clear, an arched dome studded with stars.  'That is the Plough - can't you see the shape? - those seven over the Water Rock. And follow those two, the pointers, to that very bright one. That 's the North Star, right over the North Pole. That 's where Santa lives.'  Carmel, walking alongside, saw it at once. Not to be outdone, I saw it too, and identified the wrong pointers, and the wrong Pole Star, and the wrong starting point for Santa, who landed on the roof at night, as long as you were asleep, climbed down chimneys and filled stockings pinned to the mantelpiece or laid on the fender. The beam of the lighthouse sweeping the sky. First a long beam, then a couple of short ones. Regularly, every couple of minutes, providing our own illuminations, but no sign of Santa. Then home into warmth and light and breakfast. Then banging the table with a knife and fork at dinner time and calling for  'more turkey' . And running up to the chapel afterwards to see the animals in the crib and put halfpennies in the slot, which made the plaster angel on the collecting box nod her head in thanks. Creeping up with Carmel to look through the grimy, uncurtained windows of a nearly derelict house occupied by a gruff old man and seeing a body slumped in a chair before the empty grate, newspapers on the floor, rats eating them and nibbling at his toes. A young woman in a bathing suit of great elegance and style, diving off the quay into a full tide to impress her banker boyfriend and disclosing, to a small boy sitting on the edge, a hole in the bottom of her costume. A man potting a billiard ball with a flourish of the cue to end a break, and shouting triumphantly in a strange accent,  'In like a baird, Michael'.  And since a baird was what Daddy shaved off with a cutthroat razor in the morning, it was hard to see how it could get into the pocket. Or a glass-sided hearse waiting in the gateway to bury the people across the road. Or crouching in the graveyard among the stones watching funerals. Or a widow who had been weeping at the funeral of her husband, spitting on the grave after the will had been read. Or the nuns in a group sitting on a rock, not noticing the tide coming in, until they stood like penguins in their full gear, long black robes and stiff white hoods, as the water rose around their narrowing perch, refusing offers from the girls to lead them to safety through the water, or from the bigger boys to carry them off, jumping from rock to rock, until a rowing boat arrives from round the pier to lift them off and carry them to dry land. Or standing by the bedroom window, frozen with fear, as a young man walks in through the open gate and picks up my new leather football, a present for my birthday, and walks off with it under his coat in broad daylight on a summer evening. And standing there for some time after he has gone, and running crying to the bar to complain, and Ray rushing out in a useless search up and down the street. And the shame, for years, of not having shouted out to frighten him off, or of not running for help in time, or of not standing up for my rights, and the suspicion of not having kicked up a row until it was too late to do anything about it. Or sitting in a boat holding onto the line streaming over the side, and feeling the tug and pulling in, hand over hand, until a twisting silver shape lodges itself under the keel, inaccessible. Or going on a long expedition with Carmel up the Point Road, past Barney O'Prey 's, and deciding the lighthouse is too far and taking a short cut towards the Institution across Ranaghan 's bog, up to the ankles in mud, having to jump ditches filled with water and across sheughs and stiles and barbed-wire fences until emerging on solid ground behind the chapel, and the distress and anger when we got home, late, bedraggled and dishevelled. Or a little man walking up and down at the corner explaining to other men:  'Finance - that refers to money matters.'  Or Daddy coming back late on a special train from the Eucharistic Congress in Dublin with a green plate with a picture of the pope on it which hung on the wall over the room door for years, and praying all day that his train would not be stoned or burnt or wrecked on the way home. Or the parcels from the outside world at Christmas and Halloween, the turkey from Waterford wrapped in sacking with the postmark on the label, the barnbrack from my Kerry grandmother, made specially from ingredients she had supplied, wrapped in tinfoil from the inside of a tea chest, then in newspaper, then in brown paper, but still smelling sweet in the postman 's hands. And the weekly papers, sent after having been read, folded so as to allow the name and address to be written in the white space beside the title, and tied with cord: the  Waterford Star  and the  Kerryman  , and the Christmas number of the  Cork Examiner  , full of ghost stories - banshees, horseless carriages, headless riders, men carrying coffins who disappear over cliffs or into thin air, hearses and funeral processions appearing from nowhere, spectres rising from the sea and out of the air - enough to keep any young boy in the house for years with his head under the bedclothes. Visits to genteel old ladies who gave you tea and seed cake or Marietta biscuits. Hospitable houses where you would get a piece, a slice of baker 's bread spread with butter and sprinkled with sugar, or a soda farl or curranty cake. Or a yacht lying on its side, flat on the waves on a lee shore, the masts gone, the sails too, or the great geyser from the Sucken Hole, or the east wind in the winter, or the collier riding high on the evening tide as it sails light, or the train, or the brick, or the harvest, or the people and the sayings and the songs. \n Why these memories and not others? Anything remembered is bound to be distorted, anything observed, seen through a lens, anything recorded, selective, but what I hope this account conveys is the experience of living in Killough in the thirties, seen through the eyes of a child. The picture is impressionistic, in places pointilliste, with image overlapping image and pigment on top of pigment, a constant interplay of light and shade, blurring, obscuring, fudging the edges, but in the end, I hope, viewed from a distance, and in perspective, conveying an overall sense of place and time and providing a feeling of what it was like to live there. The people who move in and out of my memory are not all the people of the village, or even the best or the worst of them. They are the ones who for some reason, perhaps a kindly act or a bizarre action, or perhaps only for a telling phrase or a snatch of a song, lodge in the memory and are imperfectly re-created. \n In previous generations the romantic dream was of descent from noble blood, or great wealth fallen on hard times, leaving a latent residue of decency or pride or good breeding ready to be discovered by the appropriate fortunate circumstance or fairy prince. Then there was rags to riches, log cabin to White House, and greater merit in having made it on your own than through inherited wealth or privilege. And very often nowadays autobiographies seem to claim extreme poverty and hardship, to child abuse and harassment, and to the more exotic reaches of incest, sexual perversion, rape within the family and psychological torture and emotional deprivation. That I can claim none of these is not, I hope, a result of self-censorship or an impaired memory but of a reasonably happy childhood in a village community that was supportive, caring and generally compassionate. I shall try to avoid the Water Rock of self-glorification and the glair of self-abasement in recalling those days and that place. I describe people, perhaps not as they were but as I remember them. Events change too, and the order and sequence imposed by memory may not stand up to historical analysis or carbon-dating. Some people dominate in the mind of a child more than they might otherwise be entitled to, others are altogether forgotten, wiped from the tablets of memory. \n If my mother looms large it is because she gave me most of the words, but it was my father who took me on the walks, and most of the people quoted were talking to him and not to the invisible child who eavesdrops and overhears, silently taking it all in. This is not intended as a moral tale, or social satire, or a history of Killough, or an autobiography, or to poke fun at people, or to hurt. It is a small bit of my memory, and an oblique tribute to the kind and decent people and to the small community who provided warmth and friendship and the wealth of their experience and a sense of belonging to me as a child. \n TWO \n THE IMMEDIATE STARTING POINT that jogs my memory is a faded sepia snapshot. Five figures sitting on a low sea wall alongside the road at low tide, a calm sea behind, and in the background, flat coastline on the other side of the water. The time, probably the summer of 1930. Four children and a young woman, two girls about six or seven years old and two toddlers, similarly dressed and clearly twins. It is a bright, sunny day. The little girls in summer frocks and ankle socks; the young woman, wearing a flowered dress, a coat and a cloche hat, sits solidly on the wall, conscious of the responsibility she has for the children, while the infants sprawl against her knee in a careless way, one more sober and sedate, the other full of repressed energy. Who are they? Why are they there? After the fleeting moment caught by the camera, what has life in store for these children? In the snapshot they are the focus, the centre of attention, the fixed point in the firmament.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "2c009aa1-5e12-45a5-a8a2-e6653f5196fe", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.708877+00:00"}
{"text": "<The Wasted Years>\n\n\n<$A>\n Chapter 1 \n BELFAST, 1938 \n The power went off, and as the looms ground to a halt the weavers changed their old, comfortable shoes for more serviceable ones, donned their coats and headed for the door. In spite of the glass roof light being whitewashed against the glare of the sun, stifling heat still built up inside the factory and they were relieved to escape out into the fresh air. One of the many mills that provided work for the people of the Falls and the Shankhill Roads, the Falls Flax Factory was situated in Cupar Street; right in the centre, at the 'T' junction where it curved sharply to the right and continued on up to the Shankhill Road to the Protestant districts, while the left-hand turn became the Kashmir Road and ran on to the Springfield Road and the Catholic districts. \n Arm in arm with Rosaleen Magee, May Brady felt the tension ripple through her friend as they walked out of the gates on to Cupar Street. She knew what was causing Rosaleen such concern, or rather who, and sure enough, there he stood, about six feet tall, jet-black hair and eyes as blue as a summer sky. This was the third night he had been waiting outside the factory. But for whom was he waiting? Mr Blair 's secretary? Yes, it must be Miss Maynard he was waiting for. She was the only one May could picture him with, although May had seen and been dismayed by the look that had passed between Rosaleen and the handsome stranger on Monday night, the first he had been there. She was also aware that Rosaleen had her old work coat lying open, disclosing the fact that she had taken the time to remove the overall she wore to protect her clothes when working, and May could see that she was wearing one of her better skirts and a cream-coloured blouse that was just a few weeks old; a blouse that enhanced the fairness of her skin and lightened the green of her eyes. This was unusual, very unusual, because dust from the weft in the weaving shop got embedded into everything, causing a fusty smell, and it was customary to wear old clothes to work. \n Why on earth is Rosaleen wearing her new blouse? May mused. Surely she did not fancy the handsome stranger? A small frown puckered her brow as she pondered. All the same, she must. Why else risk ruining the new blouse? Oh, don't be ridiculous! she admonished herself, but was unconvinced. Isn't she engaged to be married? \n Rosaleen 's thoughts were running along similar lines to May 's. Why was she so aware of this man? In four months ' time she would be married to Joe Smith. Big, kind, handsome Joe. She loved Joe. So how come a single glance from a pair of blue eyes could floor her? She kept her own eyes demurely downcast, but she was very much aware that the man 's eyes never left her face, bringing a bright blush to her cheeks, and that when they passed him, he turned to look after them. \n  \"I wonder who the big hunk 's waiting for?\"  May muttered, with a sidelong glance, covertly watching Rosaleen 's reaction to her words.  \"Probably Miss Maynard,\"  she continued, and jerked her head back towards the factory.  \"She 's the only one in there I can picture him with. I can't see  him  with a weaver or a winder.\"  \n  \"Who are you talking about?\"  Rosaleen asked, trying to appear disinterested and failing miserably. \n  \"Oh, that big, tall, handsome stranger that you never noticed,\"  May answered crossly. She was annoyed with Rosaleen and showed it. Why couldn't she be honest and admit that she found him attractive? Unless . . . surely she couldn't find him  that  attractive? Oh dear God no, that would never do.  \"All the men around here wear Crombie overcoats and patent leather shoes that of course you wouldn't notice him.\"  \n Hot colour brightly burned in Rosaleen 's cheeks. She could not understand why, but she did not want to discuss the man with May. Perhaps because he affected her so deeply. On Monday night she had been laughing when he had caught her eye and an electric current seemed to run like a live wire between them. Time hung suspended as they gazed in awe at each other. Just a few seconds, but it had filled her with rapture, and she had recaptured the feeling often in the past few days and hugged it to her. \n Joe did not have this effect on her and she felt guilty and uneasy at her reaction to this stranger. Last night and tonight she had avoided looking directly at him, scared of the effect he had on her, but she had been very much aware of his scrutiny. \n Now she muttered.  \"No, you 're wrong. Miss Maynard stops work at half-five so she 'll be long gone. It 's not her he 's waiting for.\"  \n May shot her a sharp glance and saw the heightened colour. So, she  had  been giving him some thought and wondering who he was waiting for. \n  \"Who do  you  think he 's waiting for?\"  she asked, slyly. \n But Rosaleen was no fool. She knew May 's curiosity was aroused and did not want to continue the conversation, afraid of betraying the emotions the stranger had aroused. She wanted to put all thoughts of him from her mind; his obvious interest in her made her feel uncomfortable. \n Shrugging her shoulders, she cried gaily,  \"Oh, who cares?\"  And to change the subject, she asked,  \"Are you going out tonight?\"  \n She and May had been friends since their first day at primary school and only the arrival of Joe on the scene had come between them. They still had one night a week out together, a Friday night, and this they spent at the Club Orchid Ballroom. Joe did not like dancing but Rosaleen loved to dance and this way everybody was happy. \n My was not hoodwinked. She knew Rosaleen was deliberately changing the subject, but decided to let her get away with it. \n She gave a deep sigh.  \"No, I 'm washing my hair tonight and I 've some clothes to launder.\"  \n Being the eldest child of a family of six, she preferred to launder her own clothes than have them done with the family wash. Her mother was inclined to boil everything together in an old tin bucket and many a jumper and cardigan had been ruined, hence her desire to do her own laundry. She envied Rosaleen, who had only one sister and who was lifted and laid by her mother. \n  \"Well, see you tomorrow.\"  She squeezed Rosaleen 's arm before letting it go.  \"Don't do anything I wouldn't do.\"  \n  \"That gives me plenty of scope.\"  Rosaleen retorted, with a toss of her head that sent the blonde hair swinging about her face, making May wish, not for the first time, that she was blonde and beautiful, instead of plain and mousy. \n With a deep chuckle, she turned down Clonard Gardens which joined Clonard Street and ran down on to the Falls Road where she lived, while Rosaleen continued on up the Kashmir Road. \n As she hurried along, her thoughts returned to the dark stranger. Why did he affect her so much? Chemistry, that 's what it was! If they were to meet and talk they would probably bore each other to tears. With this observation she relaxed and turned her thoughts to Joe. Kind, handsome Joe. Nothing must interfere with her plans to marry him. \n Her first and only serious boy friend, he was a wonderful person who idolised her. He had put down a deposit on a house in Iris Drive, off Springfield Avenue, and was in the process of decorating it, for them to return to after their honeymoon in Bray. No greasing someone 's palm with a tenner for the key to a rented house; no for them! Not every girl was lucky enough to marry a man with his own business. Just a small business, dealing in wrought-iron gates and railings, but there was room for expansion, and Joe was full of plans for the future. No, she would be foolish to let anything interfere with their plans. Why, it was wrong even to think of another man. \n Nevertheless, in spite of her good intentions, the minute the alarm clock shattered the silence on Thursday morning, her thoughts returned to the stranger and she jumped out of bed. Dampening her hair, she rolled the long blonde strands in curlers and left it to set while she quickly washed herself down in the draughty scullery and then ate the breakfast her father prepared for her every morning. Her father was a good man; there were not many like him. Every morning he was downstairs first, and after lighting the fire he prepared breakfast. Then, without fail, he carried a cup of tea and a round of toast upstairs to her mother, before departing for Greeves Mill where he worked in the flax store. \n Once ready for work, with her hair swept up at the sides and hanging to her shoulders in the current page-boy style, she gave into the    temptation   to use a little make-up. Just a little. A light touch of Pan-stick and a hint of rouge. She did not want May to notice and comment on it. \n But alas, she may as well not have bothered. There was no sign of the tall, handsome, stranger outside the factory gates that night and she did not know whether to be glad or disappointed. \n On Friday morning she was pushing away at her looms, lost in thought, when Betty Devlin came and stood beside her. She did not know Betty very well; a non-smoker, she did not therefore gather in the toilets where one met all the newcomers and was kept up to date on all the gossip. Knocking off the handle of the loom, Rosaleen gripped the comb and helped the loom to stop more quickly. Then, with a smooth, fluid movement, she exchanged the empty shuttle for a full one and set the loom in motion again, before turning to Betty, an eyebrow raised inquiringly. At the same time she removed the empty bobbin from the shuttle and put a new one in from the cage of weft that sat above the loom. Looms had to be kept constantly on the move or they left marks in the cloth, bringing the wrath of the examiners down on the culprit 's head. So keeping an eye on the three looms, she gave half of her attention to Betty. She guessed the girl was probably collecting for something; someone getting married or maybe someone retiring. \n While Rosaleen changed the shuttle, Betty eyed her closely. She had known right away who her brother was talking about when he had described her. There were not many girls as lovely as Rosaleen and she could understand why her brother was attracted to her. \n Leaning close to make herself heard above the clatter of the looms, she cried.  \"Did you notice a tall guy standing outside the factory a couple of nights this week?\"  \n To her amusement, colour flooded Rosaleen 's face and neck. Even her ears went a bright pink, causing Betty to laugh outright. \n  \"Obviously you did! You and half the factory! Well he was waiting for me. He 's my brother Sean and he wants a word in with you.\"  \n Rosaleen found herself smiling in return. It was a long time since she had heard that expression:  \"Wants a word in with you\".  Not since she was about fifteen. Still, Betty was barely sixteen, so that would account for her using the term. Then the girl 's words sank in and she went redder still. He wanted a date with her! \n She shook her head and said,  \"I can't. I 'm engaged to be married.\"  \n Betty eyed her bare left hand in disbelief and Rosaleen quickly explained,  \"I don't wear my ring in here, the stone 's too big.\"  \n That sounded like boasting, but it was the truth. Joe had invested a lot of money in her engagement ring, a huge solitaire. She had demurred but he had said,  \"May as well, while I can afford it. It `s an investment, so it is. A ring like that can only grow in value and . . . God forbid . . . if we 're ever stuck for money . . . well, it 'll be there.\"  \n However, she was nervous when wearing the ring, it was an awful responsibility, and she would not dream of wearing it in the factory. \n Betty shrugged and gave a rueful smile.  \"Oh, well.\"  She forced an exaggerated sigh from deep in her chest.  \"Our Sean will be disappointed, but still I did my best.\"  \n Deep blue eyes, just like his, laughed into Rosaleen 's. Then, giving Rosaleen a wink and a nod, Betty turned and made her way down the shop floor, weaving in and out of the fast-moving machinery with graceful steps and a seductive sway to her small, neat bottom. Very much aware that her progress was watched avidly by two fitters who were maintaining a loom. Rosaleen watched her for some seconds, amusement in her eyes, then turned her attention back to her work, but her action were automatic, her mind full of thoughts of 'Sean'. Imagine him wanting a word in with her. He had a cheek all the same. Sending word in like that, instead of asking her himself. This thought sent dismay flooding through her. What if he was outside tonight and spoke to her? The very idea of it made her tremble and she chastised herself: Stop acting like a fool! He means nothing to you. \n One of the looms dwindled to a halt and when Rosaleen saw the flaw that had been caused by a broken thread, she muttered to herself as she let out the web and started to rip out the flaw. That 's what you get for daydreaming. Get your mind back on your work, you silly girl! \n That night, keeping her head down, she gripped May 's arm and hustled her quickly through the gate and past the corner where he usually stood. Not even trying to catch a glimpse of his well-polished brogues, should he be there. \n May allowed herself to be propelled along Kashmir Road in silence, a resigned look on her face, but when they reached Clonard Gardens she said, with a gentle shake of her head,  \"He wasn't there.\"  \n  \"What?\"  Trying to look indifferent, Rosaleen tossed her head and added,  \"I don't know what you mean.\"  \n  \"Ah, Rosaleen, be honest!\"  \n Shame-faced, Rosaleen muttered,  \"He 's Betty Devlin 's brother. He wants a word in with me.\"  \n May gaped at her and Rosaleen laughed softly before repeating with a smile and a nod:  \"He wants a word in with me.\"  She chuckled aloud at the idea.  \"Imagine! I felt about fifteen when Betty said that to me.\"", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c7d6f035-d3d6-4e62-9d5e-0ffd0e375ce3", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.709910+00:00"}
{"text": "<Derby Day>\n\n\n<$A>\n DERBY DAY \n There were two nights in the year Hughes never slept, the night before the away match with Shanroe Dreadnoughts, and the night after. The match was a personal Gethsemane that he endured for love of the Longfield Slashers, but he longed for the chalice to pass. It was the local derby, highlight of the sporting year, a virility test for the young bulls of the parish. It was no place for an old bull with tampered mileage. He did not train for love of the game because he was not in love any more. There was no profit in the final lap of the field but he gritted his teeth over the last half acre, refused the last pint and no drink lapping against his tonsils. Each year Hughes pawed the ground and was proud. The real question emerged on the dreaded morning with the journey to Shanroe before him. \n The light slithered across a greasy sky in the direction of the enemy, luring him towards a personal Calvary. Soaked in sweat, he tested his body in the hope of sickness but his slack carcass glowed with health. Jim Hughes groaned softly and eased his legs over the side of the bed. More than life at stake. The last game of the league and a pennant to be won. A pennant for a penance if the run of the ball was kind. They shared the top of the table and the laughing had to stop. The moment of truth for an old bull. It was winner take all or derision for years. It was hard to escape the pain or forego the pleasure when you share a parish. \n The meeting with McGovern was a bad omen. He confronted him at the edge of enemy territory, the kesh that separated the two farms and their sporting outlook. McGovern looked at him sideways, like a duck looking into a milk bottle. \n  \"Brady 's in quare fettle this weather ..\"  \n  \"Is that a fact ... \"  \n Peter Hugh Brady. Full back. Crag upon crag. Dour as a coven of Ballymena men. He avoided pubs during the happy hour. He played on the Dreadnoughts team the year they won the title. His opponent on final day reared a family of walking sticks. He chewed staples for breakfast on a good day. \n  \" ... never saw him so contrary since he was a gasun ..\"  \n The Dreadnoughts were suspended after that. Barred for life by the Gaelic Athletic Association for foul play. They reformed as Saint Judes but it was no good. Once a Dreadnought, always a Dreadnought. So they disbanded and waited for heads to roll at county board level. In the meantime, they lingered over their ale and blamed the Slashers for their misfortune. The Slashers were in a different football league at the time. Brady raised the Dreadnoughts when the ban was lifted. \n  \".. Brady played tig with hatchets in 'dem days ... \"  \n  \"May the best team win ... \"  \n McGovern fixed him with his good eye and leaned across the shaft of his spade, foot planted deep in Hughes territory. \n  \"Not so simple, Jim .. not so simple ... Brady hasn't forgiven of forgotten the sousin' ye dished out to him in Longfield last year .. he took it sore .. manes te straighten ye on the sabbath ..\"  \n Hughes felt agitation, a sliver of fear. \n  \"But I met him at the dance later on ... not a word spoken in anger ... we lowered a rake of pints ... langled the devil before the night was out ..\"  \n McGovern forced a laugh and grabbed another foot of land in his excitement. \n  \"That was the stumbler .. ye boy ye .. thought ye could buy him for a pint in his paw ... well .. ye thought wrong .. ye can't hit a man who won't let ye put ye'r hand in ye'r pocket can ye .. besides ... Brady is a quiet class of a creatur .. not easy riz off the field ... ye wouldn't hear his word at a dummies convention when times are normal .. but he roars on the Lords day ... like the rest of yis ... house angels .. street divils ... mass going six days a week and a pagan for an hour of a Sunday .. don't get me wrong .. fair play to ye .. got to hand it to Longfield .. well worth the win last year .. can't take it away from ye .. but your supporters are hard to take .. a hateful shower of bastards .. don't get me wrong .. ye won well .. apart from the sousin' of Brady ... still if ye'r sorry .. if ye want me te warn him off ... \"  \n Hughes measured the distance and leaned forward. The foot of McGovern returned to the land of McGovern. The retreat caused a rush of blood to the head. \n  \"That cuts both ways, McGovern ... what happened before can happen again ... I mane te get me retaliation in first ... .\"  \n Hughes heard the words and looked around, convinced that a stranger had arrived and heckled over his shoulder. The landscape was still, save for the rustling trees alive with rumours of indiscretion and the gulps of McGovern swallowing his excitement. \n  \"Ye don't say Jim ... boys a dear .. ye don't say .. Brady won't be plaised if he hears .. but he won't hear it from me .. no way ..\"  \n McGovern looked at his watch and stiffened. \n  \"Christ .. is that the time .. have to go, Jim ... got to chase the pork through the cabbage ... me belly thinks me throat is cut .. good luck te ye an all hard cases like ye ... though if Brady is right ..\"  \n Hughes watched him scuttle across the meadow moving faster than he ever did goalwards, where the pain was. He cursed softly. The bacon and cabbage would wait if the speed of McGovern was the key. And he sped in the direction of Brady. Caesar sent his legates into Gaul to the camp of Vercengetorix. And in Gaul they swore in a Shanroe accent. \n Hughes drank sparingly on the eve of the contest, a small sacrifice to make and the honour of the Slashers in the balance. The pub was awash with anticipation. They fired his memory with tales of past deeds and laid drink before his desert eyes, but he stayed sober. A hangover would not keep him at home and sobriety would not save him. Hughes could stand anything, except the charge of treason. They hung men for treason in more enlightened times, now they killed them with words. It was a slow death in Shanroe. He said goodbye and walked home, drunk on rumour, groggy with fear. He breakfasted on cotton wool and sheep-dip and washed his teeth afterwards. He rubbed moodily at the gums, memorising their contours.    A   man needed a gumshield to go within a mile of Brady. He put his teeth away and smiled sourly. No need to show the white feather. You feared the worst if you wore a gumshield. Better to grin and bare them. \n His iron resolve evaporated as he entered the football field. Twenty minutes to matchtime and the hallions were present. They parted at the approach of Parlour Tongs Powell. Hughes grunted in the direction of the gaunt man plodding towards the Slashers dressing room, with an oxterful of jerseys trailing behind him. Powell grunted back, lost in communion with the daisies and the ragweeds. \n The dressing room was crowded. He loved the smell of wintergreen and the smell of stale socks. It reassured him because it amounted to normality in his frayed mind. Gawky gusts of body odour went with the territory and the dull rumble of aggression hit him where he lived. Well being stirred in his cotton wool stomach as adrenaline tangled with the pain. He fashioned a knot with sausage fingers and frowned at the mound of frazzled lace. He patted impatiently at the mound as Parlour Tongs shuftied into view. It was a bad omen. A mountain of material between shooting boot and ball. \n  \"No a good story .. the lace broke ... maybe ye better play someone else up front ... I might miss a sitter ... and the match in the balance .. ye don't want that ..\"  \n The jersey caught him in the face. \n \" Say no more, Jim .. the only man in seven townlands that can put the clamps on 'don ballox Brady .. an' that 's fact of life ... \"  \n  \"I don't know ... last year .. are you sure ... \"  \n \" Certainly I 'm sure ... wish I was as sure of Christmas .. no better man ... cook the chicken ... \"  \n  \"Well .. ye might be right at that ... that 's one whingein' skitter ... and a false whore ..\"  \n  \"Number fourteen it is then ... \"  \n  \"Sound as a bell ... I made it hard for ye .. I know a few young bucks who trained hard and will sit on the line today .. they won't like it .. they train and they don't play ..\"  \n  \"Don't worry about it .. it 's a well known fact .. the tubes always turn up for trainin' ... \"  \n  \"Still ..\"  \n  \"Trainin' .. I ask ye .. new fangled ideas, Jim .. I don't like it .. in my day trainin' was somethin' ye did for a job .. the game is not the same .. contraception is killing it ... a far cry from the old days .. there is one thing missin' from the modern game that I regret ..\"  \n  \"What 's that, Parlour Tongs ..\"  \n  \"Blood ..\"  \n Parlour Tangs moved down the line. He doled out penance and absolution with the swirl of a jersey, a man in love with blood sports and the freedom of small nations. Number seven allocated by Parlour Tongs and the anointed remembered a novice. White togs and a college accent, a flying machine with a faulty gearbox who remained in neutral when he saw the cold steel. Made for the elbow in the mouth, the heavy deadener. Hughes watched as small boy changed into macho with seven on his back. The face crumpled in relief and clay hands caressed the life jacket. Suddenly the day was brighter and the fear was gone. Macho checked the number again to be sure. The hump disappeared. He flexed his fingers, did a few exercises and thought of a quiet corner of the parochial hall and Mary. \n  \"You were mighty out there today, Paul ... \"  \n  \"Lucky, Mary ... pure lucky ... the ball ran for me .. 'don drummer is heavy on the snare drum tonight .. still .. glad ye were plaised ... \"  \n  \"Proud is the word .. proud .. ye played ye'r part .. unlike 'don yellow dawkin Hughes ... \"  \n Hughes buried his head in the jersey. \n  \"A great pity--a great pity .. there was a time .. never took Hughes for a quitter but somethin' has softened his cough .. Brady sucked him in and blew him out in bubbles .. he will never live it down ..\"  \n  \"I don't want him sniffin' round our dunkel .. can't stand a coward ... I had a strong weakness for him once .. as ye know .. meant to give him the sign .. but I work with Brady 's sister and it won't do ... \"  \n  \"They should have moved me up .. I know what Brady is lost for .. and it isn't religion ... \"  \n  \"No bother to ye, Paul ... .\"  \n  \"Care for a mineral .. or anythin' else ... \"  \n The voice of Parlour Tongs sawed through his daymare. \n  \" ... . pride of the Slashers at stake ... ye should have no problem with 'don shower of pansies .. big girls blouses .. the lot of them .. the Slashers team I played on rimracked them for years .. teachers and bank officials ... most of them went to school till they were man big ... and what do they think of us .. cloggers .. that 's what they call ... pig ignorant hallions ... they say we play football because the civil war is over ... they except us to hack .. cripple .. and gouge them .. they say we are bad men to fall in front of .. they say we kick our mothers on a good d day and they expect us to kick them up in the air to watch them bounce ... well .. don't disappoint them ..\"  \n Hughes pulled the jersey over his head and faced the door. He stopped as he passed Parlour Tongs. \n  \"Ye might have mentioned somethin' in the pep talk that was legal ... \"  \n  \"The pep talk was not about football, Jim .. it was about sinkin' the Dreadnoughts ..\"  \n He noticed blood on the grass as he ran on to the pitch. Brady was in position when he arrived. Sunreddened. Scarred. Socks at half mast and broken fingernails. He trained on his own in winter months, a tin can tied to the rafters of the byre. He rose to reach it when the cows were milked, shortening the string as the weeks went by. He was fit when the tin clanged tight against the metal frame. The can was tight as a ducks arse for months if Mc Govern was correct, and that was watertight. Hughes shook hands reluctantly, counting his fingers when they were free. He examined Brady for signs of decline. No consolation there. The small eyes were a foot back in the head. Brady was short on sleep and McGovern had called, Hughes felt it in his water. The beast patted him on the back, looking for a hard place to stand. \n  \"It won't be long now, Jim .. ye boy ye ... \"  \n Hughes moved closer. He met him eyeball to eyeball, save the depth of the sockets. Hughes gagged on the foul breath that escaped through a gap in the teeth, a legacy of past attrition. The cowards blow over a fumbled ball. \n  \"Let me know where to send the flowers, Peter Hugh ... \"  \n It had to be a stranger or he was breaking his mouth in for an idiot. Brady spat into square hands and turned to face the ball. \n  \"Ye'r in our house now, Hughes ... let 's see if ye have the cheek to criticise the wallpaper ..\"  \n The first half was agony. An armpit of nudges and cheap body checks, sliding tackles and the fair hard toe. Raw sousing for a league game. It was the leather cogs he resented. Stone age footwear Brady brought as booty from another bear-pit. He was a noted exponent of the heels, a backward rake of the crude cogs across the shin as the ball was cleared from defence and the guard was down. Parlour Tongs warned him at will and he heeded the warning as the half drew to a close. But the ball danced before him on the edge of the Shanroe square and caution evaporated. He reached down for the ball and the heels arrived, raking across the back of his hands. \n  \"Take ye'r paws away .. ye pup ye ... \"  \n The crowd roared their approval. \n  \"Fair dues til' ye, Peter Hugh .. now ye'r playin football.\"  \n The ball was cleared downfield and the Dreadnoughts came again. The forward danced through the tangled defence and struck the ball cleanly. It crashed off the underside of the crossbar and bounced on the goal line. A defender collared the ball and hoofed it into the next field. The referee blew his whistle and signalled a goal. The defender ran to the referee. Hughes saw the strain on the set features. \n  \"It wasn't a goal .. ref .. the ball didn't cross the line .. it wasn't a goal I tell ye ..\"  \n  \"Read the papers tomorrow, sonny ..\"  \n The referee blew the long blast and pointed downfield.

{"text": "<Transformers>\n\n\n<$A>\n  Transformers in the Sky  \n The parents ' committee meets every first Tuesday of the month and this was a Tuesday. Rain and sleet pouring out of the heavens, an east wind that would swipe your nose off. Keith had a touch of his asthma and really I didn't feel like leaving him. But needs must. I 'd been on that committee for four years and hadn't missed a meeting. Keith seemed to be alright: he 'd got his new toy to play with, one of those little transformers all the kids are mad about. He was sitting up in bed, fiddling with it, when I looked in from the hall. So I said nothing, just wrapped myself up in my old anorak and dived into the car.  'Take care!'  Denis shouted from the hall door.  'One of those tyres is bald!'  \n  'Not as bald as you!'  I thought. But I just said,  'OK, will do',  since I wasn't in a joking mood. \n I wish we could afford a new car or a new set of tyres that aren't bald. But we 're lucky to have any car at all. \n When I got there most of the others had already arrived. There were some excuses from the usual malingerers. And one member hadn't rung but hadn't yet turned up. Kay Brown: she 's a writer, married to a well-known journalist, and kept busy, I 'm sure, with all sorts of does. One of the glitterati, she is, on the telly every time you turn it on. I don't know why she bothers with the school committee, but she does. She was elected last year, the year her kid started. It 's considered rather an honour to have her. Nobody would say that aloud but they don't need to. You can see it in the way they kind of wither slightly when she arrives on the scene, and start addressing their remarks to the door or the ceiling, instead of to the group. As often as not, Kay Brown doesn't turn up for meetings. And just as well, I think, sometimes. \n We waited for five minutes. I talked to Mrs Johnson, Brendan 's mother, about their teacher 's new habit. Keith and Brendan are in the same class, third class, and their teacher has taken to keeping them away from football as punishment for misbehaviour. What he calls misbehaviour. Going to the loo without asking for 'permission'. I ask you! That was Keith 's sin last week. He 'd had a carton of orange juice for his lunch as well as his free milk and he was caught short. So he wasn't allowed to go to the pitch.  'If it happens again I 'm complaining,'  I said to Mrs Johnson. I was relieved, very relieved, to hear that she 'd back me up. Brendan had been kept out because he couldn't spell 'spontaneous'. I mean to say. Keith has asthma. Football is good for him; he needs the air and the exercise. And the children of Ireland are overweight. A recent survey I read in the paper has found that out. And no wonder. No wonder, I said to Mrs Johnson, with one sports class a week, and then they 're taken out of it if they can't spell 'spontaneous'. (Keith, by the way, is a good speller. I taught him to spell with the Doman method when he was two.) I was glad Mrs Johnson would back me up. You don't like to complain, on your own. Fear of repercussions. \np> We started at a quarter past. Mrs Fitzpatrick, Sarah Fitzpatrick 's mother, read the minutes and correspondence. She 's the secretary, Mrs Fitzpatrick. She 's a tiny woman, only about five foot tall; she 's very young and looks like a child herself. Always dressed in track suits. Even for the meetings. This night she 'd a pink one on, with a sort of embroidered peasant motif at the neck. Very girlish and nice, actually. She 's efficient and quite dedicated. Last year she ran the sports almost single-handed (I helped by buying the medals and the other prizes, but she did all the organisation.) We listened to the minutes and they were passed and signed and then we got down to the business of the evening, which was the sale of work. It 's our biggest project and takes a lot of organising. Publicity, collecting stuff to sell, arranging timetables, staffing all the stalls. God! Only the people on the committee realise how much work goes into it. You get no thanks either. But someone has to do the job. Last year we raised three thousand pounds. That 's the average, actually. The school got a new computer and three hand-drying machines for high infants, first and second. Keith 's class still has towels, unfortunately. I had my turn washing them last week. It is ironic. He seems to be running one step ahead of those drying machines all the time. Maybe this year. \n At a quarter to nine Kay Brown arrived. Breezed in, I should say. Literally. Her long fair hair was wind-swept, her long beige raincoat was wrapped against her body, so you could see its thin lines. You 'd think she 'd been battered about by a force ten gale or something. It hadn't damaged her make-up though. </p\n  'Sorry I 'm late!'  she said, in her brisk deep voice. She has a man 's voice actually and I think that 's part of her secret. You know what I mean? People take you more seriously if you 've one of those voices. They carry better than most women 's, somehow. She sat down in the seat nearest to Mr Leech, the chairperson. \n  'Problems!'  she sighed, raising her eyebrows to the ceiling. \n As if we 'd all understand. \n As if nobody else had problems. \n Mr O'Blatheration - that 's what I always call him, privately - went on saying that we should concentrate all our efforts on the bottle stall since it was such a good money spinner. He suggested we write to breweries and distilleries and ask for contributions. \n  'Do you know how many national schools there are in this city?'  Kay Brown turned on him. Her eyes were very bright. As per usual. They have this funny mixture of amusement and something else. I can't describe it really. Confidence? As if she knew more than anybody else in the world. \n He said something that sounded like 'ahem.' \n  'What I mean is,'  said Kay Brown, her voice changing its challenging tone. She became softer, kinder, like a mother who has been impatient with her bold child but has suddenly decided to be lenient, because she 'll get better results that way.  'What I mean is, breweries and distilleries and big companies like that are probably inundated with requests like this. They 're not going to bother sending bottles to us, one school in a thousand. They probably wouldn't even answer our letter.'  \n A lot of people in the room nodded, as if this was exactly what they were thinking themselves. Well, she was probably right. She always sounds as if she 's right. Probably she often is. And then, as I was saying, she has this dogmatic sort of voice. And Mr O'Blatheration is a stupid old bore. I don't know why he 's allowed to stay on the committee. He doesn't even have a child in the school anymore. His kids left ages ago. They 're both in the States now. Still, when she said that, I said, under my breath,  'Bitch!'  I don't know why I said it. \n He didn't even answer her. Oh, trust him! He went right on, saying that we should also write to all the big shops in Dublin looking for gifts for the Wheel of Fortune. As usual, he said, he would spin the wheel. He said we should do a form letter, that we could get the president of the committee and the head of the school to sign. Kay Brown laughed and looked up at the ceiling again. Mrs Fitzpatrick said:  \"Thank you, Mr Sheridan. We 'll consider that.'  \n We went on to talk about the catering. Kay Brown had ideas about that, too. She thought we should have nothing except soft drinks. It would be much more practical. We always have tea and coffee, brack and biscuits. The tea shop is the busiest part of the sale of work, after the bottle stall. Funny how drinks play such an important part, I mean in a sale of work at a primary school. But they do. The other stalls are more for show. The real money spinners are the bottle stall and the teas. They 're a nightmare to run of course. There aren't enough boilers and the room we have it in is too small. But it 's part of the sale of work. \n  'You don't have to be traditional,'  Kay Brown was saying in her persuasive voice.  'Just because something is traditional doesn't mean it 's sacred. Look, I guarantee that if we sell nothing but soft drinks we 'll make exactly the same profit we make on teas, with one quarter of the work.'  \n Soft drinks. Just what I don't want to see more of. Denis has been on the dry for two months now, going to his AA meetings as regular as clockwork. The fridge is full of bottles of Coke. He 's spending more on Coca Cola than he spent on booze. I haven't been able to get Keith a new pair of shoes. Even the children 's allowance seems to disappear before I know where I am. Poor Keith, his toes will soon be out through the pair he has. If Denis keeps off the booze it 'll be worth it. If ... \n Mrs Murphy agreed with Kay Brown. About the drinks. Mrs Murphy has five kids in the school. She 's one in nearly every class. Steps on stairs. The da is out of work but you couldn't tell it from the kids. She keeps them neat and much better dressed, half the time, than a lot of the well-off ones. Don't know how she does it; it must be a real struggle. Kay Brown is quite friendly with Mrs Murphy. She 's one of the few people on the committee she talks with, actually. It 's as if Mrs Murphy is special because she 's so poor and brave, just like Kay Brown is special because she 's so talented and beautiful. It really gets me when Mrs Murphy sides with Kay Brown. They really think all the rest of us are crap. \n Suddenly something funny happens. I get this buzzing in my ears. A sort of zinging sound. And at the same time I get this picture, this weird mental image. I see myself, naked in the middle of the kitchen at home. I 'm chewing something, some herb, parsley or something, and I 'm transforming. I 'm slowly transforming into some sort of animal. A brown animal, furry. A white tail, long legs, long ears. A split lip. It 's a rabbit. No. A hare. I 've turned into a hare, in my own kitchen. I hop around, timid looking, as if I 'm getting my bearings in my new shape. I jump up on the table. There 's a head of lettuce lying there but I ignore it. Instead I take a flying leap and I 'm out through the window, out in the garden. \n Out of sight. \n Where am I off to? \n When I said that thing about getting more machines, drying machines, last month, Kay Brown laughed and said:  'Do you know that those drying machines constitute a danger to the human skin? Towels are much safer. Much. Doesn't matter how many germs are on them.'  \n Honestly! \n As soon as any other business is over I leave the room. I don't stay on for the tea and biscuits. I leave the room and I go out to the car and I drive home. It 's still raining. The road is black and shiny like polythene. Reflected lights dance on it, yellow, red, green. They hop around in front of my eyes so that I can hardly see. There are other lights leaping around in my eyes, too. Shimmery lights reflected in the tears that are covering my pupils like ice melting on black tar.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a426b314-8361-4500-829f-5c5dbc0fc492", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.712696+00:00"}
{"text": "<A Second Life>\n\n\n<$A>\n  Chapter Six  \n Aunt Cissie must have had trouble walking by now, but her garden was still kept immaculate. The windows were painted the same cream colour as when I was young, the front door the same dark varnish. On summer days I knew she would still hang a tattered green awning over it to protect the paintwork. \n It was the final week in March. The new car which Geraldine had bought had been sitting outside for ten days. Without telling her, I got in and drove off. I didn't want a fuss and didn't know myself if I would have the courage to drive the two miles to Aunt Cissie 's. It was fourteen months since I had last made that journey, yet I knew that she would greet me as if it were only days. She put her head to one side when she answered the door, trying to disguise her pleasure. There was a scent of baking filling up the whole house and her hands were coated in flour. \n  'Speeding again I heard you were, you wee scut.'  \n I grinned, the trauma of the past few months being reduced to another childish prank. This doorstep was where I had always ended up when there was trouble. \n  'If you think I look bad,'  I joked,  'you should see the bus.'  \n  'Well, you weren't speeding to see your old aunt, anyway.'  \n  'Is there any tea in the pot, Aunt Cissie?'  \n  'That wife of yours not feeding you, Seanie? You 'd better come in so and don't be bringing any of your oul cameras with you.'  \n The hallway seemed smaller and more dank than when I was last here. I remember how big I once felt when I was able to jump up and flick on the light switch. I noticed that the same heavy switch had survived various rewirings. \n  'You have the house looking great, Aunt Cissie. It hasn't changed a bit.'  \n  'You 've been singing that song since I was twelve.'  \n She slapped me playfully on the arm and pushed me into the living room. From inside the kitchen I heard the heavy kettle being filled and the whoosh of the gas being lit. When she came out she had tried to put lipstick on without a mirror and it was smudged, highlighting the fine down of hair above her upper lip. There were traces of flour in her hair where she had run her hands through it. \n The room seemed at once both familiar and exotic. A blessing from Pope Pius XII still hung on the wall. I remembered staring at the Latin inscription as a child. She selected and carefully wiped the best china, and as soon as I had taken a sup of tea she held the teapot out to refill the cup, almost pouring through my fingers when I held my hand out to motion that I had enough. I knew how disappointed she was that I had not called an hour later, when today 's bread would have been ready. Her eyes followed mine to the faded photo of John F. Kennedy over the television. \n  'God, that man fairly made the bed shake,'  she said, wry humour replacing the almost religious tones in which the household had once spoken of him.  'He was a new Daniel O'Connell, all right.'  \n I remembered the joke from her native Kerry that you could not throw a stone over an orphanage wall without hitting one of O'Connell 's bastards. \n  'You have the piped television?'  I asked. \n  'The best company in the world,'  she said,  'after the women down in bingo. Especially the American wrestling on the satellites. Them would have been the boys to beat the Black and Tans. Did I tell you what I 've won at the bingo since?'  \n  'No.'  \n  'Not even the price of the bus fare. It 's a good thing I 've the free travel pass.'  \n We both laughed. For as long as Aunt Cissie had not been going to see out another Christmas she had not even won the price of the bus fare at bingo. She stopped talking, that old smile on her lips as she tilted her head sideways in anticipation, knowing that I would not have called without a reason. I smiled back, suddenly embarrassed. \n  'Maybe I just called to see how you were keeping.'  \n  'Pigs could fly, wee scut. You never just called to see me in your life. Say what 's on your mind.'  \n I put the slender cup down. Underneath the tea leaves I knew there was the carving of a girl 's face which used to fascinate me as a child when I was allowed to touch her china. I tried to think of a way to begin. \n  'I don't know what 's been on my mind really since the accident, Aunt Cissie. All kinds of memories, and ...'  I paused.  'You know that I was dead for a few moments?'  \n The few people I had been unable to avoid meeting were either overexcited or dismissive about this. Aunt Cissie just nodded gravely. \n  'I find it 's hard to adjust to ordinary life. Things have a way of playing on your mind afterwards. You know, with no parents or brothers or sisters it 's hard to know what you 're remembering or only imagining. It 's only a little thing, but lately I 've been wondering ... we only lived a mile from the Botanic Gardens and yet I can't remember my mother ever setting foot beyond the gates. It was like she was frightened of the place. There had to be a reason.'  \n Cissie poured herself more tea. A butterfly had got in and flapped about in the lace folds of the faded curtains. \n  'Your mother was very ... well, ashamed isn't the right word ...'  Aunt Cissie began,  'but uneasy about not being what she called your real mother. The way it was, after a while all of us forgot that you were adopted. Well, maybe not forgot, but you were just another little terror and she was another mother coping like the rest of us. We were all too busy with everyday problems, but your mother ... she 'd spend hours peering at you as a baby, comparing the way you reacted to everything with how our children reacted. She couldn't shake it from her head that you were not responding to her the same as a child would to his natural mother. \n 'She could blow the smallest thing out of proportion, your mother. She suffered traumas that I wouldn't even be aware of until they were over. It 's hard for any mother with a first child, but when you 're that insecure ...'  \n Cissie looked at me. \n  'How old is your boy now?'  she asked. \n  'Just three.'  \n  'It 's a magical age that.'  \n  'I know.'  I realized how disappointed Aunt Cissie must have been that I had not brought Benedict with me. \n  'You can't tell a three-year-old what 's real and what isn't,'  she said.  'God knows, it doesn't seem long since you were three. Do you remember the times I used to mind you?'  \n  'You used to mind the whole street.'  \n  'Sure you were more fun than the rest of them together. Such a serious little face and the blatherings away out of you, your hands darting in all directions and everything said as solemnly as though it were the end of the world.  Mind me.  If there was a fly in the room you 'd run into the kitchen, lip trembling,  mind me.  Same as if crowds came in. You were never really able for people. The kitchen to yourself, that was your idea of paradise. Every pot and pan out on the floor and you 'd be running in and out, so serious about what you were pretending to cook that I almost expected to see cakes and tarts appearing in the pans you had arranged under the kitchen table. I never met a child with an imagination like yours.'  \n She stopped talking. It was hard to reconcile myself with the child she spoke of or to equate this old woman with the figure of the strong aunt I remembered. \n  'Why do you ask about the Botanic Gardens?'  Her voice was quizzical. \n  'I don't know.'  It was only half a lie.  'Like I said, maybe I 've just had too much time on my hands to dwell on little things.'  Her husband had been among the dead faces in the kaleidoscope which had greeted me at that instant of clinical death. I thought of telling her how well and happy he had looked but knew that I never could mention the experience and she would never wish me to. It made me feel lonely again. \n  'I used to ask you who all the pretend cakes you were making were for,'  Cissie said.  '  \"Mamma, Dada, Auntie Cissie, Baba Seanie and the old man in the shed.\"  One time when your mother was collecting you I told you for a laugh to go down and ask the old man in the shed if he wanted a jam or an apple tart. Off you went, racing down the garden as though somebody really lived down there. Your mother and I were sitting here in the kitchen laughing at your imagination when you came in, panting, your face so serious.  \"Jam tart,\"  you said.  \"The bits of apple stick in his false teeth.\"  I looked at your mother, wee scut. Three-year-old boys don't make up that type of remark. Maybe you had heard it somewhere else, but you frightened the wits out of us both that day. We never let you down near the shed again.'  \n I strained to remember the incident, but all I could recall was the bolted shed in the distance and the time that my uncle had kept a greyhound locked in it and he used to bring me down to see the wet tip of his nose sticking out under the crack in the broken boards. I had been much older then, six or seven. There was little I could really remember about the age she was speaking of, except that single image of sitting on a ridge of grass and poking at the loose earth where a worm was slithering back under the soil. \n  'I know it was just your imagination,'  Cissie said,  'but at times it was frightening. The same summer you turned three your mother came over here in tears. She had brought you in to see her brother 's grave, your Uncle Peter. He fought in the British Army in the war, you know. The Desert Rats. Had almost half his head blown off. I don't know how they patched him up or how he lived so long. One moment the man was sane, the next you 'd realize that he thought there were other people in the room as well as you, soldiers he fought with, Arabs on camels and God knows who else. It was the first time your mother had been to the grave in the seven years since he died. She hadn't even told you what a grave was. I think she was going to explain to you about people getting old and going to heaven. She thought that you were gazing down at the flowers she had placed in the urn when you looked up at her. That man has no ear. Your voice was like you were saying that there was a big truck passing on the road. She grabbed you up in her arms and ran all the way home from the cemetery.'  \n  'Maybe I 'd heard them talking about him?'  I said.  'Maybe I expected to see a man there?'  \n The sun had gone behind a cloud and it was dark in Cissie 's parlour. The story unnerved me. Suddenly I wished I hadn't come to her house. Partly it had only been an excuse to see if I could get back behind the wheel of a car again. I had been given my life back, so why couldn't I just accept it joyously without having to mull over every scrap in my past?", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a2d48773-ac92-41bf-a581-0a3256324bfe", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.713675+00:00"}
{"text": "<Reading Turgenev>\n\n\n<$A>\n Reading Turgenev \n 2 \n Mary Louise Dallon retained in her features the look of a child. In an oval face her blue eyes had a child 's wide innocence. Her fair brown hair was soft, and curled without inducement. Her temperament remained untouched by sophistication. Once in her life she was told she was beautiful, but laughed when the statement was made: she saw ordinariness in her bedroom looking-glass. \n In the schoolroom next to the Protestant church Miss Mullover had once taught Mary Louise, and would have retained a memory only of a lively child had it not been for the same child 's sudden interest, at ten, in Joan of Arc - or Jeanne d'Arc, as Miss Mullover insisted upon. The saint was a source of such unusual fascination that Miss Mullover wondered for a while if the child possessed depths she had overlooked: an imagination that would one day bear fruit. But Mary Louise left the schoolroom with no greater ambition than to work in the local chemist 's shop, Dodd 's Medical Hall, and in that she was frustrated. Circumstances obliged her to stay at home, helping in the farmhouse. \n In a different generation Miss Mullover had taught Elmer Quarry, who left her schoolroom to board at the Tate School in Wexford, nearly sixty miles away. The three Quarry children - Elmer and his sisters - came of a family that for many decades had been important in the town. The Dallons - out at Culleen - had struggled for as long to keep their heads above water. \n In later years Miss Mullover observed from a distance the vicissitudes and worries that governed the family life of the Dallons, and the changeless nature of the Quarry 's domestic and mercantile routine. She noted that money meant as much to Elmer Quarry in his middle age as it had to his forebears, that generally he was as cautious as his father and his grandfather had been, that he abundantly enhanced the Quarry reputation for good sense and a Protestant order of priorities. In each generation for more than a century the inheritor of the Quarry 's drapery had married late in life, establishing himself in the business before he turned his thoughts to the securing of the line: the old house above the shop in Bridge Street had seen more that its share of young wives made widows before their time. So it was that in 1955 Elmer Quarry was still a bachelor and the only well-to-do Protestant for miles around. All over the county wealth had passed into the hands of a new Catholic middle class, changing the nature of provincial life as it did so. \n The Dallons ' roadside farmhouse in the townland of Culleen had never been more than modest, and in 1955 even that modesty was considerably eroded: the whitewashed rendering was here and there fallen away, slates that had slipped out of place or cracked in half had not been replaced, a pane in an upstairs window was broken. Within the farmhouse, rooms were in need of redecoration; paint had chipped, damp loosened the tattered wallpaper of the stairway, the unused dining-room smelt of must and soot. Five Dallons lived in the farmhouse - Mary Louise and her sister Letty, her brother James, and her mother and father. \n Standing on the edge of the farm 's twenty-seven acres, the house was three miles from the town where Quarry 's drapery had prospered for so long. On Sundays, driving into the town in their black, obsolete Hillman, the Dallons formed almost a quarter of the Protestant congregation; at Christmas and Easter the numbers swelled to thirty-three or - four. Elmer Quarry and his sisters were church-goers only on these festive occasions, but for the Dallons - especially for Mary Louise and Letty - the weekly occasion of worship provided a social outing they enjoyed. \n The town was small, its population just over two and a half thousand. A turf-brickette factory had been opened seven years ago, where once there 'd been a tannery. There was a ruined mill, a railway station that was no longer in use, green-stained warehouses on either side of the town 's single bridge over its sluggish river. Shops, public houses, the post office, council offices, two banks, and other businesses offered employment, as did Hogan 's Hotel, three builders, a creamery, an egg-packing station and an agricultural machinery depot. The Electric Cinema was a going concern in 1955; the Dixie dancehall continued to attract Friday-night crowds. The Catholic church - on the town 's northern outskirts - was dedicated to the Virgin as Queen of Heaven; a convent - halfway up the town 's only hill - was of the order of the Sacred Heart. Boys were educated behind the silver-painted railings of the Christian Brothers' School in Conlon Street, and St Fintan 's vocational college offered opportunities to acquire further skills. Bridge Street, where the pink-washed Hogan 's Hotel and the principal shops were, was narrow and brief, becoming South West Street beyond the bridge. The gaunt, grey steeple of the Protestant church rose from a boundary of yew trees that isolated it from its surroundings. A pocket of lanes around the gasworks and Brown 's Yard comprised the slums. A signpost - black letters on a yellow ground - partially obscured a statue of Daniel O'Connell and gave directions to Clonmel and Cappoquin, Cahir and Carrick-on-Suir. People who lived in the town knew it backwards; those from the surrounding neighbourhoods sometimes regarded it with wonder. \n Elmer Quarry first noticed that Mary Louise Dallon was an agreeable-looking girl in January of the year in question. He was thirty-five then, Mary Louise twenty-one. Paunchy - and as square-looking as the origins of his name suggested - he was attired invariably in a nondescript suit, mud-coloured, faintly striped. His receding hair, cut short, matched this shade; his features were small and regular, a neat configuration in the pale plumpness of his face. Elmer quarry was not a tall man, but bulky none the less, an entrepreneurial presence, as his father and grandfather had been before him. He was assisted in the drapery by his sisters, Matilda and Rose, both of them his senior by a few years and possessing a handsomeness that had been denied him. Neither were married and both were displeased when Elmer 's glances were cast in the direction of Mary Louise Dallon. Why should the status quo in the house above the shop, and in the shop itself, be disturbed? Quarry 's would sustain the three of them during their lifetime, withering, then dying, with the Protestants of the neighbourhood. Neither Rose nor Matilda was the kind to avoid facing the facts: already Quarry 's was a relic from another age. If the line came to an end the business would pass to distant cousins in Athy, who would probably sell it. \n The present Quarrys remembered the time there were five assistants behind the counters, and an overhead railway network that linked the shop to the accounting office, carrying money and returning change in the hollow wooden spheres. There were just the three Quarrys in the shop now; the overhead system had years ago been dismantled and removed. But the red receipt books were as they 'd always been, stacked every evening by the tills that had been fitted. Elmer 's father had entered the accounting office every day only after the shop had closed its doors, when the clerk who returned the change in the wooden containers had gone home. But since there was no clerk now and since Matilda and Rose managed easily behind the counters, Elmer increasingly spent more time in the accounting office. Often he sat there staring down through the small-paned floor-to-ceiling window into the quiet shop below, at the rolls of material stacked on the shelves - nylon, chintz and silk, cotton and linen - at the spools of thread in their shallow glass case, and the dresses and suits on the window dummies. As still as these window dummies his sisters sometimes seemed, one behind either counter, waiting for another customer. Matilda like to be smart; Rose dressed drearily. Matilda had more of a manner with customers, the best manner of the three, Elmer knew. Rose preferred housework and cooking. He himself belonged more naturally with the ledgers. \n The courtship began on 11 January 1955, a Tuesday. Elmer invited Mary Louise to the pictures the following Friday evening. He had no idea what was showing at the Electric, but he considered that didn't matter. Now and again, perhaps once a year, he and his sisters went to see a film because it had been talked about in the shop. He liked the News best himself, but Rose and Matilda enjoyed something light and musical. He naturally had to tell them he 'd invited Mary Louise Dallon. They continued to look displeased, but did not comment. \n In the Dallon household the invitation came as a considerable surprise. Mr and Mrs Dallon - a thin, grey pair in their fifties whose appearance was so similar that they might have been twins - recognized all that it implied, and were well aware of the habit among the Quarry men of marrying younger wives. They talked about it in the privacy of their bedroom. Mrs Dallon made a special journey to the town, visited Quarry 's drapery, bought a spool of white thread, and reminded herself of what Elmer looked like by glimpsing him through the panes of the accounting-office window. It might have been worse, she reported to her husband on her return, and later - in the bedroom - they went on talking about the development. <#>\n Mary Louise 's older sister, Letty, and her brother James, who was older also, did not react as favourably. James - impetuous, known to be of uncertain temper, and remembered from his schooldays as being a little slow - declared the invitation to be an affront. Elmer Quarry was a man who never laughed and rarely smiled, born to be a draper. Letty - secretly annoyed that her sister had been preferred, not that she 'd have set foot in the Electric with Elmer Quarry even if he 'd gone down on his knees - warned Mary Louise about what might occur under cover of darkness and advised her to keep handy a safety-pin that could be opened at a moment 's notice. Some of Elmer Quarry 's teeth were false, she declared, a fact she claimed to have culled in the waiting-room of the town 's more reliable dentist, Mr McGreevy. \n Mary Louise herself was terrified. When the invitation had come, Elmer Quarry following her out on the street to issue it, she blushed and became so agitated in her speech that she began to stammer. On her bicycle, all the way back to the farmhouse, she kept seeing Elmer Quarry 's square shape, and the balding dome of his head when he 'd bent down to pick up the glove she 'd dropped. Letty had gone out with a man or two, with Gargan from the Bank of Ireland two years ago, with Billie Lyndon of the radio and electrical shop. She had thought Gargan was going to propose, but unfortunately he got promotion and was moved to Carlow. Billie Lyndon married the younger Hayes girl. Letty had taken to saying she wouldn't be bothered with that kind of thing any more, but Mary Louise knew it wasn't true. If Gargan came back for her she 'd take him like a shot, and if anyone else who was half possible appeared on the scene she 'd start dressing herself up again. \n  'What 's showing?'  Letty asked. \n  'He didn't say.'  \n  'Hmm,'  Letty said. \n Beggars couldn't be choosers, Mr Dallon reflected in the end. To marry either of the girls into the Quarrys would mean you 'd breathe more easily, and you 'd see the sort of future for the two who were left. Mrs Dallon reached similar conclusions: provided James didn't marry, the farm would sustain himself and Letty, he working the fields and seeing to the milking, she attending to the fowls. The place was right for two, comfortable enough. Three of them left behind would be noticeable, touched with failure, although no one was to blame; a family growing old together was never a good thing, never a stable thing.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a2a4e90d-9ee9-48b1-89f5-3cd4fa5d2a09", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.714594+00:00"}
{"text": "<The Sergeant>\n\n\n<$A>\n The Sergeant \n  Mary Cummins  \n Past Lisselton, on the road between Ballybunion and Listowel, there is a spot in Ballydonoghue that divided my father 's territory from that of Listowel. There is a pub, the Thatch of the Half Way House and a stream near it, that marks the line. He pointed it out once. My parish ends here, he said. A bit self-conscious he was, using the language of another power structure. But that was how he saw his jurisdiction. There were other markers on the roads to Tralee and Limerick. \n He knew them. Inside those boundaries he knew every stick, stone and person. In those days, in the Fifties and Sixties, he would cycle to those boundary lines frequently. The Listowel road was straight but up Doon and on to Rahavannig or Beale, he would push his bicycle up the hills, mount at the top and cycle down the other side. The other guards would do it too, in turn. \n When he did not cycle out the country, he went for a walk every afternoon in winter. In summer, if it was fine, he went down to the Long Strand every afternoon for a swim. Like everything, he did it according to the rules. Wading out until the water was up to his chest he would swim parallel with the shore or swim in. He never went into the water before the end of May. He taught us to swim, holding up your chin while you flailed around trying to get the guts to lift your feet off the sea-bed. In those days there was only one lifeguard. There was usually at least one drowning every summer. For a day or two a pall of quiet and grief would hang over the town even though they were usually visitors and you would not have known them. \n You could set your watch by him every day when he went to the post office at about a minute to four. He would drop all the brown envelopes with the harp on them into the box and then set off down to the strand, walking in long strides, sometimes as far as the Cashen. This was his routine from after the Listowel Races when Ballybunion closed down until the following Easter, if the weather was good, or Whit. \n Walking back the Long Strand, he would take in deep breaths, sometimes stopping for a minute. On fine days, when you could see nothing except the glassy sea and the coast of Clare, the sea gulls swooping, he would say,  \"Isn't this grand. Think of all those people stuck in cities, working away in the heat and the smells. Look what they 're missing,\"  he would say, before striding off again. It has given me a life-long habit of fast walking, tireless until I stop and realise how far I 've gone. \n Before the sandhills skirting the golf course were eroded, there was an alternative route up and down the dunes, jumping over Kitty 's River. If he was busy, he would only go as far as the 6th, mostly to the 9th and sometimes all the way to the 18th hole. Then, in the days of less bustle on the golf links, you could cross over to the Sandhill Road. That was before the new golf club was built. Long before the brand new clubhouse that replaced it this year, was thought of. The Taj Mahal, some call it. \n Sometimes we would go into the graveyard at Kilahenny and examine the graves and look at the new headstones. Then back up to the Main Street. He would tip his cap to most people.  \"Hello, men,\"  he would say to small groups at corners. One woman used to say,  \"Gooday sergeant. How 's crime?\"  He got a kick out of that and would tell my mother when we got home. Sometimes, he would chuckle suddenly to himself -  \"How 's crime\".  \n On those afternoon walks he would wear a brown gaberdine coat (tweed sports jacket in summer) over his uniform. It was his usual attire unless we were going to Cork or Tralee or he was going to a family funeral. A few months ago, I saw a man coming towards me across the newsroom in  The Irish Times.  The face was familiar but it was his gaberdine coat over the blue shirt and navy tie that suddenly, after nearly 20 years, brought the image of my father back instantly. It was Lawrence Wren, the former commissioner. He had known my father and used to take Miss Carmody 's house, next to the barracks with his family sometimes in the summer. \n A few times a year, we would go on a really long walk up to the Hill (Cnoc an &/air where Fionn and the Fianna were supposed to have fought a bloody battle) and down the other side by Moohane to Ahafona and up by East End. Townlands merged into other townlands. After Rahavannig there was Derra, the dividing line from Ballylongford. Then Lahasreagh and Ballynoneen. He knew where each started and finished. He knew who was in every house, who had died there, who had emigrated and who had trouble or secrets. On a long walk out of the town, he might tell you things but not much. He was compulsively, obsessively secretive or discreet. Sometimes he would spell things backwards for my mother and we would try to guess. Sometimes they would talk in Irish. We would try to keep up. \n This discretion passed on through the wives of the other guards. They had a special relationship. While they were part of the general life of the town, the ICA, doing the brasses in the church and suchlike, they were also particular friends with each other. Often, it was only the jobs of their spouses they had in common but that common, almost familial thing passed on to them, like a mantle of responsibility. \n Then, the barracks was the centre of most business. Spring had arrived when the boards went up outside the door with notices on them to say it was a breach of a by-law to allow thistle, ragwort or dock grow on your land. The guards did the census and everything else of an official nature so they knew everything. People had come to get passports, for references, numerous other minutiae. There was little welfare. My father would send people - mostly women who were left widowed or abandoned - to Dan Spring in Tralee. Neither he nor my mother ever talked politics, but it seemed to be taken as read that it was Dan Spring who got things done. On 15th August, Pattern Day, Dan Spring 's brother, Frank, who was the social welfare officer for the area, used our sitting room as the base for the annual ISPCC collection. There would be boxes everywhere and collectors coming and going. \n There was no bank then in the town for much of that time. Some lending agency in Cork used to ring my father to find out about people 's credit worthiness. If you hung over the railings on the landing at the top of the stairs you could hear bits of the conversation. You could hear my father telling the man what size the farm or the business was, if they were a good bet. \n The lost children, who turned up kicking and hysterical every Sunday afternoon in the summer, were kept in the kitchen until their parents, red-faced, cross, relieved and sweating, arrived to claim them. People, usually men, being taken to the asylum in Killarney were kept in the sitting-room until they were ready to leave. Long after I left home, for me, Killarney still only meant the lunatic asylum. In the summer we often went to sleep to the howls and rich, roaring language of drunks in the \"lock-up\" which faced onto the backyard. They would bang the doors and curse and swear until they passed out, exhausted in the tiny cell. \n On Sunday afternoons, my father and mother would go for a different walk. More of a stroll, usually up Doon Road and back by the Cliff Road. Stopping and talking to others. Sometimes they would meet the nuns and he would come back with accounts of how we were doing. My two sisters were hard-working and conscientious. I was bored and brazen, with a name for being clever. I got away with a lot. He used to say I was like his mother. \n She lived in Cahirciveen where he was born. My grandfather, who was in the RIC died young and left her with five sons. She reared and educated them on a tiny pension. She was supposed to be very strict and my cousin, Marian, who lived in Cahirciveen once told me that all the sons were terrifed of her. I remember going to see her with my father. Once she gave me a ten-shilling note. I remember my father telling me that when he joined the guards he used to send her <*> pound sign </*> 2 a month. This was out of his pay packet of <*> pound sign </*> 8. \n My father was from Kerry and my mother from west Cork. The Cork/Kerry thing only surfaced around the time of All-Irelands when they would banter about which team was best. But my father never openly showed a particular affiliation to Kerry. Maybe it was being in the guards. He had worked briefly in Dublin after leaving the Depot and hated it. He talked about having to walk in pairs on the streets around O'Connell Street and the open cheek they got from the Dubliners. Strict and authoritarian, he had no time for that and was disparaging about the natives of the capital. He had worked in a few different parts of the country but hardly ever referred to them. \n We never argued, never talked back until after we had left home. From time to time he would say that Dev had been right not to get into the War. The country was too poor. I never knew if he was trying to rise me when he said the worst day for the country was when the English left. When I was drifting first into communism, and then into wet socialism, he would never argue but usually had some missile to throw me off my stride. He had no time for Conor Cruise O'Brien. Any man who would leave his wife... He did not spell it out but his strength of feeling was palpable. To him, to do such a thing was a total abnegation of responsibility. It spelt feckless, irresponsible, selfish. When I was raving on about Noel Browne one day, he corrected something and said yes, he had done such and such but it was when he was in Fianna F&/ail. Noel Browne in Fianna F&/ail? My youthful idealism was severely jolted. \n He was never judgemental, at least in a language we could understand. He would describe someone as a blackguard. A rogue or a rascal was a lesser evil. Sometimes he used that description with humour in his voice. The only work of totally dismissive reproof that he used about anybody - usually a man - was,  \"he has no savvy\".  To this day I don't know what it means, but in the way he used it, no savvy meant that someone was not the thing. It was the ultimate dismissal. \n His pride in the Garda Siochana, or the Force, as he usually referred to it was cosmic. There was no other body of men like it, no better members, no higher standards. There was a sort of universal pride thing in it that was almost familial. When someone got promoted, or someone else 's children did well, it was almost as good as if one of us passed something. But also, if a guard broke a rule there was a muted sympathy in the air. There was no overt criticism. My mother used to talk sometimes about poor old this one or that one whom they knew from another place and who had a fondness for the drink or something.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d20ce215-06b1-40a7-91cc-04cc6133ab35", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.715570+00:00"}
{"text": "<North Kerry>\n\n\n<$A>\n Among places of enchantment were the woods, with their laurel, chestnut and hazelnut groves. Each season brought its own magic to the woods. Building tree houses in the lushness of summer, gathering conkers in the multicoloured autumn, wandering through the scented bluebells and wild garlic in May and collecting holly and ivy in the cold, bare woods at Christmas time, were some of the seasonal variations of activity. Born by the sea, one never loses the sound of the sea and the majestic Shannon estuary at Tarbert was a continual fascination in a whole variety of ways. There was swimming in the favoured spots such as Rusheen, Wall 's Bay, the Slatey Pier, the Island and the Back-o-the-hill. There was fishing from the pier and on \"The Bank\". Periwinkles, bornachs and mussels were in profusion and unpolluted along the shores. The tides came and went in ceaseless motion, ships plied up and down the river, and the curlews, seagulls, swans and widgeon brought the reed-fringed mudflats and creeks to life. Tarbert Island with its lighthouse, battery coastguard station and gantry brought  Treasure Island  and  Coral Island  close to home, and bands of cowboys and Indians, or hordes of cops and robbers worked out their fantastical games in-and-out through the ruins. \n In April and May the boglands called for the turf-cutting, and through the summer they spread their splendour of bog-cotton, heathers, furze and many-coloured mosses to enchant the eye. The cutting and saving of hay, with a heavy reliance on manual skill and horse power, had fun as well as work attached to it. The satisfaction of leaving a wyned meadow in the evening sun, with the aroma of freshly saved hay in the nostrils, stays as a haunting memory. \n There was no time for boredom, the word was never used. There were many hunts - rabbits, hares, foxes and the occasional badger hunt. The \"horse-park\" was the mecca for groups of young and established football players in the evenings as aspiring youngsters tried to imitate their heroes. The year was    punctuated   with a variety of activities and events which were very congenial to youngsters. The great carnivals, which drew huge crowds of all ages to the village, were held in August. The fancy dress parades were highly elaborate and imaginative. It took a couple of hours for all the sections of the parade, from individuals to large groups, to pass through the crowds lining the streets. Horses, tractors and lorries were used by the larger groups for their colourful presentations. Regattas with their boat races, swimming races, greasy poles and pillow fights, brought great excitement to the island. Matches in football tournaments drew large partisan audiences. At night the pubs resounded to laughter, songs, music and arguments. There was no consciousness of a generation gap in the dancers who thronged the marquee. The carnivals may not have had the flamboyance and exhilaration of a mardi gras, but they had as much vitality as an Irish community could give them. Other summer occasions were marked in different ways, for instance, May Eve was treated with a sense of unease and respect. The summer tree (sycamore) was brought into the houses, and whispers were made of the \"piseogs\" which could be perpetrated on that evening, which retained vestiges of old pagan folk memory. The old festival of mid-summer was also marked by the mighty bonfires on the Market Road on St. John 's night, for which materials were gathered evenings in advance. We danced and played as the flames and sparks went higher in the night sky, giving us feelings, at once, of both fascination and dread. \n The autumn evenings were marked by the Listowel races, the All-Ireland final and the Glin Coursing. As altar boys we visited the houses throughout the parish for the stations in the mornings, and attended at the October rosary and benedictions in the evenings. These led on to Halloween, with the excitement of \"high-fiddles\", snap apple, Halloween games and blind-man 's-buff. The abundance of apples, nuts and barmbracks were consumed with relish. \n Christmas, of course, was special in the village, as everywhere else. Many of us, however, preferred the activity of Stephen 's Day to the quiet atmosphere of Christmas Day. Groups of us gathered and tramped the countryside with the Wren-boys, generally being warmly welcomed and well-treated in the houses which dotted the landscape. Trudging home from the hills of Ballygaughlin, with lights and Christmas candles lighting the dark, and with many days of Christmas holidays stretching ahead, was a good feeling. New Year 's Eve was a special night in the village when crowds gathered in torchlight procession, with accordions and bodhr&/ans bidding farewell to the old year and welcoming the new. The music, dancing and songs carried on in the village square into the early hours. \n At other times, the village was entertained by the sounds and smells of the animals, which were part of the agricultural economy of the region. The cattle fairs, bull-tests and pig sales brought varied activity to delight youngsters. The great social occasion of the creamery, particularly on summer mornings, created a buzz of activity and conversation in the village, and also brought town and country close together. The forge with its sizzling fire and sound of the anvil also brought town and country and hedgehogs together, as youngsters vied to blow the large bellows to redden the blacksmith 's horseshoes. \n The carpenter 's shop with its resin-smelling ringlets of shavings was also a place of delights. The whine of the great saws mingled with the carpenter 's hammer blows, as cradles, coffins, carts and crates were fashioned. Nearby was the parish hall which housed the billiards club, the hops and the whist drives for the older groups. \n The school, for good or ill, is the institution which has a vast range of influences upon us when we are young. Many experiences    occurred   there with life enhancing as well as debilitating effects, but which stay with us to the grave. In our time the tolling of the church bell for mass, angelus, or funeral was close to us in the school. In the church the great events of Catholic life - baptism, confirmation, marriage and funeral - were conducted and, to the eyes of us altar boys, had an interesting ritual about them, if also tinged with trepidation at times. The primary school had been built in 1869 and was strictly segregated between boys and girls. Facilities were rather spartan, and the large rooms depended on the quality of the turf, brought by children 's parents, for the open fires. Discipline tended to be on the  \"spare the rod, spoil the child\"  principle, with catechism class particularly fraught with anxiety. For some of us, practice with the mouthorgan band brightened the rather narrow curricular range, which was based primarily on English, Irish and Arithmetic, with a welcome dimension of History and Geography added. \n A minority of pupils went on to secondary school in the nearby St. Ita 's. This was one of the small lay, co-educational secondary schools to be found, fairly regularly, in Kerry and Limerick at the time. The founder of the school, Miss McKenna, was a noted educationalist who set high standards as the norm, particularly in her specialist subjects, English and French. She and her team opened up for us teenagers the richness of new languages, great literatures, mathematics and so on. It was also an era in which the competition for the public examinations was much less intense than to-day. Pupils cycled and bussed from nearby townlands and villages to the school. \n We were always conscious that most parents took schooling seriously, and one took for granted a regard for learning, which was part of the tradition of the region. Both the national and secondary schools bore witness to the long-term impact, which gifted teachers can have, on the attitudes and outlook of youngsters in their formative years. Since that time the \"school on the hill\" has been replaced by a splendid comprehensive school, and it is gratifying to know that the traditions of good schooling and scholarship are alive and well in that corner of north Kerry. \n The forties and fifties were decades of economic depression, and many families suffered from the deprivations of real poverty. Employment, other than in agriculture, was very rare and emigration was the lot of many. It was sad to see so many of one 's school pals gathering at the corner to catch the bus to Limerick and be on their way to England. To get there, they were often aided by the allowances gained on F.C.A. training camps. It was the scarcity of money which acted as a constraining and blighting force on many people. The fabric of community life was maintained and, often, the very poor did not allow their material impoverishment to quench the spirit of their personalities. To a degree the old proverb <&Irish> \"Ar sc&/ath a ch&/eile a mhaireann na daoine\" </&Irish> was borne out, and various quiet forms of assistance were available. Nevertheless, life, in general, was affected by the lack of a employment for the people of the area. Even as a youngster, one was conscious of this overlay of economic hard-times, and despite the richness of aspects of community life, the potential of many individuals was not realised. \n A striking feature of this community life was the respect for individuals, the tolerance for eccentricities and a regard for the \"characters\". People were known for particular songs, or yarns, experiences or skills. This I have found to be a strong feature of life in Kerry, but, no doubt, is not    unique   to it. There is, however, a delight in difference, a pleasure in language usage and a regard for the individual experience, which    is   a valuable feature of life there. \n  Old Glories Reflected in Stone  \n Among many features one would like to dwell on, I will touch on one which struck me very forcibly, as a young person, but which was not much mentioned - Tarbert 's walls. To a youngster 's eye in the forties and fifties there was very little industrial or commercial employment in the village, but all around one were mighty walls and large buildings which spoke to one of a different era, a bygone era in a Tarbert which must have been very different. They stood silent as sentinels and witnesses of a Tarbert which must have been more vibrant. They symbolised an era when there must have been great collective endeavour. The question arose as to what had happened in old    Tarbert   that left us so many monuments in stone, which seemed out of keeping with the community 's character at the time one was growing up. Only communities with a sense of confidence, of collective purpose and of optimism built on a grand scale, and such optimism was foreign to the decades of the forties and fifties. Another question which arises in one 's mind was the number of skilled craftsmen who must have been there to build such splendid edifices. The scale of the building projects would have required a whole sophisticated culture in crafts, but particularly in stone masonry. When I looked at skilled masons in our time, they seemed to be the inheritors of this older tradition. As well as the scale of the buildings and the remaining walls of greater edifices, one was also struck by the beauty of the stone itself and by the skill and sense of pride which exuded from the workmanship. \n The surviving evidence went back to the medieval times as evidenced in Kilnaughtin Church and Lislaughtin Abbey. In the latter, the beauty of the dovetailing of the flat river stones with the shaped limestone of sedilia and lintel windows has been beautifully caught by the Polish artist Ursula Ratzlaff O'Carroll.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "e5c949d0-56a2-4f68-bc88-8e74867aa67d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.716690+00:00"}
{"text": "<Place and Displacement>\n\n\n<$A>\n Place and Displacement \n  Clairr O'Connor  \n My parents left home when I was fifteen. It wasn't unexpected but it was still a shock. Home was Limerick. Limerick city. My father said he was going home. Home to Listowel, Co. Kerry. Ever since I could remember he 'd been saying he would go home one day. Perhaps I had heard it so often, I no longer listened. When I was five he had said,  \"One of these days I 'll go back. Limerick is fine but it 's not home.\"  Naturally I was confused. Limerick was the only home I knew. Kerry was for the holidays. Ballybunion, Stack 's mountain, Listowel, daytrips to Tralee. My mother came from Ballyalnan, a little village near Newcastle West, Co. Limerick. Summer holidays were divided between Kerry and Co. Limerick. \n My parents boasted about the virtues of their respective counties. Did this move to Kerry mean that my mother had lost? An independent woman from a very early age, my mother left her village after her Inter Cert. and went to England to train as a nurse. A thrifty country woman she brought her rustic virtues to a war-torn London making delicious meals out of meagre rations to the delight of her city bred London nursing friends. On a visit home to visit her widowed mother and her sister she met Ned O'Connor on the train from Dublin to Limerick Junction. He proposed to her some months later having first checked out her Catholicity by writing to her parish priest in England. An almost priest, my father has remained fervent to this day. \n They married two years later. My mother returned to Ireland to live. She got a nursing post in Limerick and my father worked in Shannon Airport, the duty free section. Unlike most of the women of my mother 's generation, she continued to work outside the home after she had children. Nursing was very important to her. She was a meticulous homemaker as well. A splendid plain cook, there was always a pot of home made soup available, brown bread, scones, pies and special cakes for birthdays and Sunday teas. A woman of tremendous energy she applied her skills at home and at work. Her children 's clothes were labelled and shelved. As a child, I both admired and felt intimidated by such order. As an adult I now realise that she probably insisted on such detailed order as a means of cutting off the criticism that was levelled at women who worked outside the home during the fifties and sixties. \n I did not want to move to Listowel with my parents. I was in my Inter Cert year at school and pleaded impending exams as my excuse. But the truth was, I didn't want to leave the Shannon, my friends, the familiar geography of my existence; King John 's Castle, Cannock 's clock ringing the hours. I helped my parents pack and waved them Listowelwards with a smile. That night I howled my despair at their desertion into my pillow. I had got what I wanted but somehow I had lost. A hard one to figure. I had been left in the care of my aunt Mary until the end of the school year and my exams. Meanwhile my parents and my younger brother settled into the house in Convent Street in Listowel. I did not sleep that first night of their going. I hugged the night until dawn came. Then I got up and made a cup of tea. I trod warily, anxious not to wake my aunt. \n I took down one of my grandmother 's cups from the top shelf of the dresser. It was stark white with a decoration of a single bare branch of an oriental looking tree. This tea set was only used on Sundays. I felt a delicious sense of trespass as I drank thirstily from its restrained elegance. I thought if my grandmother (my mother 's mother, Ita Nash) was here now I would be able to tell her of my confusion. She had lived with us until her death two years previously. She had been a playmate in spite of the generation gap. She allowed me to win at snakes and ladders and I enjoyed dressing up in her long dresses. A good musician, she played the fiddle, tin whistle and concertina. At family gatherings she played, my father and brothers sang and my sister and I danced reels and hornpipes. \n As I sat there drinking out of the Sunday cup the morning after my parents ' defection it suddenly came to me why my father had been harping on about going \"home\" to Listowel for years. When my grandmother had died two years previously I was so distressed that a few days after the funeral I decided to leave home. I was thirteen at the time. I talked to my best friend Breeda about it. She was Breeda with two ee 's just as I was Clairr with two rr 's. I wanted to go to Newcastle West and its environs, my grandmother 's home territory. She had two sisters living within a six mile radius of each other outside the town. It was early January. I looked up the bus schedules and cashed in <*> pound sign </*> 5 of my post office savings and Breeda and myself headed for the country. I felt quite heroic. It was a stylish way to grieve, I thought - to go back to where my grandmother came from. \n On arrival at our destination, I told the white lie that my parents knew where we were. There was still a week to go of the Christmas holidays from school. My relatives accepted my story. In that thoughtless way that children can, I did not think about the anguish my parents and Breeda 's would go through when they discovered we were missing. I banished them from my mind and gave myself up to the moment. I rekindled my spirits at the open hearth, stamped my feet on the front door mat of the flagged floor kitchen as I came in and out like my cousins did. I watched my grand-aunt make bread and listened to her stories of when she and my grandmother were girls. There were tales of dances at the cross roads and house dances galore, matches made at harvest times and egg money put aside for material for dresses. I tried my best to be useful. I took my turn with the goose duster and polished the black range with zebrite. My grand-aunt liked to bake in a pot over the open fire but her daughter preferred the range. Three days into my runaway visit, my grand-aunt and her two daughters took the pony and trap into Newcastle West. They promised to bring me a bag of bull 's eyes when they returned. They came back earlier than expected and in some agitation. \n I learned that they had rung my mother at the nursing home where she worked. Sister had told them that Nurse O'Connor hadn't been at work for the past few days. Clairr and a friend had gone missing. My parents were in a terrible state. The gardai were doing their best but so far there was no sign of them. I was suitably mortified when my runaway status was exposed. Only then did the full seriousness of what I had done dawn on me. I wondered if we 'd be sent back to Limerick in the pony and trap. But no. The Volkswagen was seen as a more speedy vehicle for our return. My grandmother 's relatives did not scold us but it was clear that they thought we were \"bold\" for putting our parents through such needless worry. At home, I was greeted by a white-faced father and mother. According to my own logic, I explained I had to go away to be near my grandmother. My mother was furious. She said hadn't she enough trouble with her mother dying besides her daughter running off all in the same week. \n My father said he could understand that I had wanted to be near my grandmother 's relatives at a time like this. A daylong funeral wasn't enough at all to have a proper conversation with all of the people who had come for my grandmother 's burial. If it had been in Kerry, the wake would have gone on for several days and I 'd have been so exhausted at the end of it that I wouldn't have had either the energy or inclination to run off anywhere. I was grounded for months after that, only released from the supervision of the household for school and music lessons. I wrote letters to my dead grandmother in my journal (a hardbacked copy book) complaining about the unfairness of it all. I wrote her replies as well. She was on my side of course. I wished that she could play me a tune to cheer me up. \n As I drank from my grandmother 's cup in my aunt 's house the morning after my parents had left Limerick for Listowel, it occurred to me that my father was going home to Kerry to be with his own people just as I had followed my grandmother 's people to Newcastle West after her funeral. Twenty years in Limerick had not made him a Limerickman. It had copperfastened his resolve to return to his home town. And so, he had taken early retirement from Aer Rianta and gone home to Listowel to open up a little bed and breakfast business. My father 's mother, Katherine Kirby had died while still in her forties. Dead more than twenty years before I was born, obviously, I never met her. But from the earliest days she looked at me from photographs. Prim-featured, her hair always held under different hats, she looked at me and at the world as if she knew the measure of things. She played the piano well and married Bill O'Connor against her father 's wishes. He charmed every woman he met. Or so the story goes. I have no recollection of meeting him. \n After Katherine died, he married secondly and begat a large young family. My father and his sister Kathleen, lived with other relatives instead of in their father 's house. Though my father has never said this to me, I think he must have had feelings of being dispossessed from that time. His need to go home to Kerry was a primitive one, to live again where his young romantic mother had played the piano for himself and his sister. Aunt Kathleen, my father 's sister, died when she was twenty six. I never met her but I 'm told I inherited her high instep but not her sweet disposition. In the mid sixties, when my father 's stepmother emigrated to England, eight years after her husband 's death, my father went home for good. He knocked the old house and built a modern one. The gate and yard face Convent Street and the garden overlooks the island where the Listowel races are held every September. \n At various times in our early childhood, my brothers, sister and I had accompanied our father to the races in September. It was a wonderful feeling being released from the schoolroom when our Limerick friends    were   confined by school and its curriculum. The horses racing, the crowds, the town open for business were invigorating. We were treated to endless lemonade and chocolate. I brought home a leprechaun snowstorm and a cup and saucer embellished with shamrocks from one such outing. I bought them in one of those shops that sold everything from fertilizer to knitting needles. They cost six shillings and ninepence. And of course, there were my father 's relatives pressing half crowns and even the odd ten shilling note into the hand. \n We didn't visit his cousin Nora and her husband at Stack 's mountain during race week. Stack 's mountain was for the summer. Nora had no children but was amazingly tolerant of us and our soft city ways - like wearing shoes in the summer for instance.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d8706f4c-b97f-4650-9f76-7f0065aae189", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.717816+00:00"}
{"text": "<Market Place>\n\n\n<$A>\n Born in a Market Place \n  Bryan MacMahon  \n I was four years of age when, taken by the hand, I was led down to our newly built house in Market Street. As the name of the street implies, our back gate now opened onto the marketplace itself; standing on the \"keepstone\" on which the two parts of the backgate were anchored I peeped out through a bolthole perhaps six inches square and found myself gazing into a new and magical world - the world of the market. \n To make it more personal, my grandfather, old Pat MacMahon, was weighmaster and was thus in charge of the place. He must have been a tenacious old man, for, refusing to have soldiers of the empire billeted upon his home, he was deprived of his licence as a publican and was later fortunate enough to be appointed to the post he then held. \n The marketplace branded me for life. It was thronged with country-folk almost every day of the week. When it wasn't a calf market, it was a pig market or a butter market: on Fridays it was the country produce market - perhaps the most exciting day of all. \n The cattle fairs were held in the adjoining streets- directly under my bedroom window as well as in the broad Square. On the occasion of the Old or Big Fairs they spilled into the other streets of the town. There were times when I awoke at daybreak to hear the sound of hooves under my window and to realize that a horse fair was in progress. Donkeys, mules and jennets were also bought and sold on these occasions: these provided a plebeian counterpoint to the three-quarter bred horses destined for the hunting field. The    ammoniac   smell of horse droppings and cowdung lingers in the recesses of my nose to this day. \n So I became acquainted with all aspects of country life as seen through the glass of the market. The place had marvellous ancillary goods and produce for sale at its gates and archways. Scollops or thatching withies, eelfry, cockles sold by the fluted pint glass, salmon, beef sold by the yard and hung on a steelyard or \"stiller\" to be weighed, periwinkles and seagrass. \n There were innocent looking churns which looked as if they contained \"home\" or sour milk for pot-oven baking, but when the cover was removed - this when the whole area was cautiously surveyed - the vessels were seen to be three quarters full of sea trout or, as we called them, \"white\" trout known in Irish as <&Irish> \"liath&/ain\" </&Irish> or grey trout. The net used for killing these fish was called the <&Irish> \"Cauteen\" </&Irish> and it had a finer mesh than the net used for salmon - indeed it was sometimes slipped inside the main net for the purpose of holding the smaller fish. \n As the Friday produce market drew near I was often deputed to purchase the vegetables for the week or month as the case may be. Buying these in bulk was buying at cost and always proved to work out far cheaper than the price obtaining in the shops. My main commission was to buy a sack of potatoes. I was warned to purchase only those that were balls of flour when boiled - and certainly not those which turned out like bars of soap. An error in this regard was reckoned a calamity. I was seven or eight years of age at the time. I thought of a cunning plan to ensure success on every occasion. \n I faced the crowded market. The potato sacks with their owners were ranked against the pillars of the Market sheds. I strolled along the file of vendors, my attention focused on the men from the seashore - this because potatoes from the sandy soil with seaweed as its manure were reputed to be far better for eating than those produced on cutaway bog. As I went I picked up spent matches from the ground. \n Back at the first pillar I asked the man if I could have a sample spud. The sack was open and a boiled floury potato offered as example of the finished product. Taking a sample from deep in the sack I marked it as No.1 by sticking a single match into it. Second pillar, the sample was marked by two matches and so on down the line until No.10 which looked weird with ten matches sunk deep into its flesh. This concluded my sampling. I slipped in home then and boiled my store of spuds. Ah, No. 6 was a beauty! I went back to the market and bought No.6 sack. \n Not bad for a cute Kerry lad of seven! \n I must mention the shawls worn by the farmwives and others: as I recall it the mingling of these coloured garments strengthened the impression that, when one was in the market, one was also in a near-Eastern bazaar. \n The wives of the \"strong\" farmers wore capacious biscuit-coloured woollen shawls each with a delightful hem of tassels and ornamental thread-work in various colours. The quality of the garment - its opulence at times - offered a clue as to how many milch cows were on the husband 's farm. Acreage offered a misguided measure, for a farm was then adjudged by such sayings as  \"He has the grass of sixty cows\"  or  \"She took in a fortune of <*> pound sign </*> 2,000 to that place\".  There was also an implicit distinction made between arable and bogland; this distinction was clarified when the grazing of a cow was mentioned. \"Turbary\" or the right to cut turf on certain defined areas of bogland was also an added bonus relied upon at times of sale, purchase or the making of matches. \n As boys we treated those glorious shawls with scant if not impious attention. Stationing ourselves in church directly behind a pair of similarly attired matrons we tied the tassels of adjoining shawls together with \"black\" or firm knots. When the women parted company at the end of Mass and made to move off in different directions in the church aisle their tugging pulled the shawls off each others ' heads, so that the cursory attire beneath was in each case exposed to a    merciless   public gaze. <#>\n There were other shawls in the marketplace. Fishwomen from Tralee who sold cockles from wicker baskets, wrapping them in clutches of newsprint, wore dark chocolate coloured shawls while our own women from the thatched cottages of the town wore plain black shawls.    swapped   over backyard walls to attend the earliest Sunday masses the shawls allowed housewives to attend service anonymously and without the trouble of dressing up. A single eye seen in the upper triangle of the shawl often gave a keen observer a clue as the identity of the woman behind this Irish yashmak. \n But for me the most attractive shawl of all was the green and black paisley shawl worn by the women from the other side of the Ferry, that is south of the River Feale and west to the Shannon mouth. \"Mahera\" we called that area. The old saying  \"Marry a Mahera woman and you marry Mahera\"  gave some indication of its clannishness. For me this shawl conveyed an impression mingled of faction fighting, (The Cooleens versus the Mulvihills), hurling - (Ballyduff had already won Kerry 's one and only All-Ireland Senior Hurling title) lovely loam, a Round Tower, and the net fisherman of the Cashen estuary with their unusual boats called \"ganelows\" - probably a corruption of gondola. \n All this vanished world, as evoked by the green and black shawl, I experience again on visiting a folk and general museum perched high above the Cashen fishing village, a place familiar to the thousands of visitors to Ballybunion during the summer season. \n The marketplace was then shot through with the idealism of freedom; balladsingers, each with his swatch of rebel songs, moved through the throngs. (Later, I wrote many of those ballads for my friend the printer.) The muttering about grabbed farms and rural boycotts were background music to the shouting of castclothes men with their marvellous rhetoric and the land-hungry cry of  \"The land for the people and the road for the bullock.\"  The accessories for the carts were versatile - the creel or rail for bonnavs, turf or turnips, the seat-and-guards for travelling to town or even to Mass, the low box for carrying sand or gravel while the bare cart itself was capable of being loaded with stable manure or a piled array of sacks of various kinds. The vehicles were locally called Scotchcarts as opposed to the  \"tumbler from up the country\"  or even the \"slide\" used in the Dingle area for bringing down turf saved on the mountain flank. \n The colour of the carts was a brilliant orange red with the shaft ends tipped with black: each one had the name of its owner and his townland print-painted in black at the point where the right shaft met the body of the vehicle. I came to know of every townland and of almost every family within thirty miles of my town as a result of perusing these inscriptions. I even made a collection of the townland names, querying the former owner as to where it was situated and more importantly still, the meaning of the Irish version of the name. \n The butter market was something I was deeply involved in. As my father 's health waned he gave up his law office post and took to buying butter for export, working hand in hand with his brother who was a creamery manager. The butter borer used for testing the country butter took my attention. I learned to insert it in the butter pile, spin it full circle, extract it, smell the butter, bite a chunk of it, roll it round in the mouth as if testing wine, uplift one 's judicious eyes to the heavens, spit it out at a certain place in the yard and finally offer a grudged grunt of approval of its merits. \n If my grandfather reigned over this colourful kingdom I was often his viceroy. This was when the market was quiet and my grandsire and one of his cronies stole off for a pint. I was then left in charge of the place. I directed horseloads onto the weighbridge, weighed them, issued a ticket and later deducted the tare or weight of the unladen vehicle. I progressed so far in my avocation that I could look at a sack of potatoes and tell almost to the pound how much it weighed. I was then about nine or ten years of age. \n There was always a double line of horse rails of turf just inside the market gate - a point which was a fruitful source of interest to me. Sometimes I 'd find a dead hare hanging from the willow fork which kept the creel in place. The hare was for sale, of course, but I 'd ask for, and was given, the tail. It was easy to bargain with the turfsellers on a rainy day as our yard was on the market and the seller sold the turf at a reduced price so as to enable him to go home quickly. I came to know at a glance from which of the many bogs of North Kerry any particular creel of turf came and thus could size up its heating qualities at a glance. \n There was one particular turfman who got the better of me in repartee. When I countered his asking a certain price for his load by saying  \"I could buy a few hundred-weights of good English coal for that\"  he said quietly,  \"Do you know what Dean Swift said about that?\"   \"I don't remember,\"  I said.  \"He advised the Irish people to burn everything English except their coal.\"  After that I always called the man Dean Swift and never after bargained with him about the price of his turf.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "cc9da767-da34-4d63-b8bc-07163e0ddbe2", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.718787+00:00"}
{"text": "<Amongst Women>\n\n\n<$A>\n Though it was in its late September glory Michael lost all interest in his garden; the falling petals stayed unswept and the flowers wilted and fell into a tangled mess. Several times Rose tried to prod him towards the garden but after a short time he would just stand in it, disheartened, looking on at the disorder before moving away. The girls had praised his green hands. His involvement in the little garden was not strong enough to survive without their praise. \n He had few outside interests. He did not play football or any team games nor did he fish or hunt or swim. Knowledge and information he was able to pick up without effort and he always came close to the top of his class without appearing to study. Except for maths he showed no interest in any one subject above another and his liking for mathematics seemed to stem from the fact that it came to him so easily while others struggled. With the girls gone, his main distraction and society had gone, for out of Moran 's sight he had loved to tease and play with them and they with him. He was as tall at fifteen as he would ever be and though he would never have Moran 's dramatic good looks he was handsome. After his sisters left, he discovered that he was attractive to women but it was to older women that he was drawn. From Moran he inherited a certain contempt for women as well as a dependence on them but it did not diminish his winning ways. The one drawback was his lack of money. To go about with young women he needed money and Moran would not part with any. \n He went to Rose. She gave him a little money but grew alarmed when he began to come home late at night. When she got out of bed, anxious to see that he was all right, she discovered that he smelled of drink. At school he began to earn money by doing difficult maths exercises for slower boys. Moran had been listless about the house since the girls had gone but once he discovered that Michael was coming home late at night he acted decisively. Without a word of warning he bolted every door and window in the house and waited up. \n When he heard the latch of the back door being raised, he was dozing in darkness. Then he heard various windows being tried. Softly he went to the back door and drew the bolt and as soon as he heard returning footsteps he opened the door. \n  'This is a nice hour,'  he said.\n 'I was in town. I couldn't get a lift back. I had to walk.' \n 'What were you doing in town?' \n 'There was a dance.' \n 'Did you ask to go to the dance?' \n 'No.' \n 'No  what  ? No, pig!' \n 'No, Daddy.'  \n Moran beckoned him to come in and as he was passing him in the narrow hallway he seized him and struck him violently about the head.  'I 'll teach you to come in at this hour! I 'll teach you to go places without asking! There must have been drink at this hooley as well!'  \n Sheltered by his sisters, Michael was unused to any blows and angrily cried out as soon as he was struck. There would have been a violent struggle but for Rose 's appearance. \n  'What an hour to come in at, Michael! You have Daddy up worried about you the whole night.'  \n  'I couldn't get a lift. He hit me,'  the boy cried. \n  'You haven't seen the end of this by half. I 'll teach you one good lesson. Nobody 's coming into this house at any old hour of the night they like while I 'm in charge here.'  \n  'Everybody 's tired now. We 'll get to bed. Anything that has to get gone into can be gone into in the morning,'  Rose said. \n Moran glared at her. He seemed about to brush her out of the way to seize the boy but drew back.  'You can thank your lucky stars the woman 's here.'  \n  'He hit me,'  the boy sobbed. \n  'And I 'll damn well show you what it is to be hit the next time you come into the house at this hour. You 're not going to do anything you like while I 'm here.'  \n  'I 'll go away,'  the boy shouted self-pityingly. \n  'Everybody 's tired. Look at the time it is. You can't be coming in at this time. You had poor Daddy and everybody else worried to death about you,'  Rose scolded and managed to shepherd both men to their rooms without further trouble. \n  'I 'll see that gentleman in the morning,'  Moran warned.  'He needn't think he 's getting away with anything in this house.'  \n Rose got him away to school early in the morning but it was only a postponement. During the weekend Michael had the good sense to stay well in the background and Mona and Sheila came from Dublin for the weekend, which postponed any confrontation further still. Moran was so taken up with the girls and their life in Dublin that he hardly noticed him. \n These visits of his daughters from London and Dublin were to flow like relief through the house. They brought distraction, something to look forward to, something to mull over after they had gone. Above all they brought the bracing breath of the outside, an outside Moran refused to accept unless it came from the family. Without it there would have been an ingrown wilting. For the girls the regular comings and goings restored their superior sense of self, a superiority they had received intact from Moran and which was little acknowledged by the wide world in which they had to work and live. That unexamined notion of superiority was often badly shaken and in need of restoration each time they came home. Each time he met them at the station his very presence affirmed and reaffirmed again as he kissed them goodbye. Within the house the outside world was shut out. There was only Moran, their beloved father; within his shadow and the walls of his house they felt that they would never die; and each time they came to Great Meadow they grew again into the wholeness of being the unique and separate Morans. \n  'That boy thinks he can stroll in here any hour of the day or night he likes. I 've warned him once and for all and I 'll not warn him again. He may not take heed and if he doesn't I may need your help to bring him to his senses,'  Moran confided to Sheila during one of the weekends the girls came from Dublin. She nodded and listened. She did not want to know where the talks led. Tomorrow she would be back in Dublin.  'To bring him once and for all to his senses; was like far-off thunder that could promise any sort of weather. \n Moran 's warning on the night he locked Michael out had little effect but to make him more calculating. For so many years he had been protected by the cushion of the others that he alone in the house had no residual fear of Moran. When he was going to be late he now made some excuse. Moran was often tired which was reason enough for him not to stay up to check the lateness. But the sorest point was his constant need of money. \n  'You must think I 'm made of money. You must think money grows on bushes. You must think all I have to do is to go out and gather money like a few armfuls of hay for cattle. I had no money at your age. And none of the others in the house ever had the money you want.'  \n  'Everybody at school has money, more money than I ever have,'  the boy said resentfully. \n  'Then their fools of fathers must have more money than sense. I can tell you there 's no money here. I can tell you that once and for all and for good.'  \n Then Michael went to Rose. Again she gave him small sums. She was very fond of the boy, though by now, except for a coltish awkwardness, he was more man in height and strength than boy. All of them now looked forward to Christmas. Each night brought it one day nearer. The girls would be coming home and all of them would be together again under the same roof. Each dull night sharpened that anticipation. \n Rose had already made the plum pudding. It lay wrapped in dampened gauze in the biscuit tin on top of the dresser. A week before Christmas Moran dragged a huge red-berried branch through the front door and dumped it in the middle of the room, filling the centre of the floor. \n  'What 's that doing here?'  Rose asked in dismay. \n  'Didn't you tell me to look out for berried holly? You 'll not see much redder than that. I don't know how it escaped the birds.'  \n  'I said a few sprigs not a whole tree.'  \n  'Easier to cut the branch than pluck here and there among the thorns. Can't you throw out what you don't want?' \n  'Oh Daddy, we just want a few bits for the windows and pictures. But the berries are beautiful. It 's such a pity to destroy a whole tree for a few sprigs.'  \n  'It 'd go to waste on the birds anyway. Better to have too much than too little.'  He went out pleased by the mild censure of the tree of red berries lying in the middle of the floor. \n It moved Rose to decorate the house at once in order to be rid of the huge branch, and Michael helped. In an hour bits of berried holly were twisted in all the picture cords and left in rows along windowsills and shelves.  'Daddy can never do anything by halves,'  Rose laughed as they hauled the branch outside. It still had enough berries to decorate several houses and they both laughed in indulgent amusement. \n During these weeks at the prospect of his sisters ' homecoming Michael returned to being a child of the house. He was poised on the blurred height, as eager to come down and be cradled and fussed over as to swagger and tomcat it out into the wild. Maggie crossed over to Dublin the night before Christmas Eve. She spent the day in Dublin and the three girls took the late train next day. \n Moran left alone for the station. Michael stayed outside the house in the cold clear night until suddenly the lighted squares of the diesel train rattled across the darkness of the Plains.  'The train has passed!'  he rushed inside to cry to Rose. In spite of the cold he kept opening the front door. Excited herself, and caught in his excitement, she had not the heart to tell him to keep it closed.  'They're here!'  he called to her as soon as the headlights turned into the short avenue, and leaving the door wide open they went to meet the car. By the little wooden gate there were hugs and cries, eager kisses, the calling out of names, Sheila, Maggie, Michael, Mona, Rose, Rose, Rose, Rose, each name an utterance of pleasure and of joy. They were home, they were home for Christmas. Moran 's family were all, almost all, under the one roof for Christmas. They had come to what they knew best in the world. \n  'Look what I brought for Christmas,'  Moran laughed proudly when they were all inside.  'Three fine women.'  Words rushed against one another from the two who loved to talk, Maggie and Sheila, came to a stop against one another, laughed in impatience at each block, and rushed on. Mona was silent or spoke quietly. \n By the time tea was taken everyone was quieter and each of them speaking naturally. All they had to do was observe the happy rituals: help prepare the turkey, remove the curtains from the front windows and light a single candle in each window, kneel to say the Rosary together, dress and get ready to go to midnight Mass. As they knelt on the floor, Moran began,  'In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost we offer up this most holy Rosary for the one member of the family who is absent from the house tonight,'  and the dramatizing of the exception drew uncomfortable attention to the disturbing bonds of their togetherness. \n The three girls, Rose and Michael packed into the small car which Moran was driving to midnight Mass. They sat on one another 's knees and joked.  'I think you 've put on weight since you went to Dublin.'   'Your knees haven't got softer anyhow since,'  laughing and chattering away the discomfort of the physical constraint. Single candles burned in the windows of all the houses they passed and pinpoints of light glittered as far as the first slopes of the mountain in the sea of darkness.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "82b9a95d-0c9c-45b9-808f-13be23fdb748", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.720232+00:00"}
{"text": "<Bridie's Wedding>\n\n\n<$A>\n BRIDIE 'S WEDDING \n Bridie sits on the window sill and sips hot milk and pepper. Sheila kneels by her side. From beneath the bedclothes she peeps out at them. The streetlamp strokes orange onto their long white nighties and again across the curlers bumped tightly over their heads. Their whispers stay with them over there by the window but the odd one strays across the room and delicious it is when it 's caught. Bridie is afraid of something, something to do with Joe. But who on earth would be scared of Joe? His swinging smile and adam 's apple like a bouncing ball. And Sheila is thrilled by the same something. So what could it be? It had to do with being nude. Milly says when you get married you  have  to go nude. But Bridie would never do that. Why even in here, in front of her sisters, she would undress herself as if she was an orange in a circus. An orange that unpeels itself under a tent. Fancy being afraid of Joe. Oul Joe ... \n Meat sweat sneaks up the stairs and wakes her. Oh and the smell of cooking so early makes her feel funny; half-queasy, half-hungry. She opens her eyes and the room is alive. With crisp dress cloth and perfume hissing and stockings slapping into place. And Bridie 's face like a small white turnip through the mirror and then changing slowly with each sweep of colour into a bride for Joe. \n  'I 'm burstin',  she says to anyone who is listening and Sheila says,  'You 'll have to wait.  If  you don't mind. Mr Clifford is in there.'  \n But she doesn't mind. She lies back nursing the urge and imagines what it will be like to sleep alone. Now that Bridie is almost gone. \n Eileen says,  'Quick, he 's finished,'  and they all stop to listen to the cough that he gives each time he comes out of the bathroom. \n He 's left the smell of himself inside so she holds her nose and tries not to breathe. He 's left the heat of himself as well around the rim of the toilet seat. And some dead black hairs stuck in the foam of his shaving soap. She washes her face and looks into the mirror. She makes two circles from her fingers and places them over her eyes. Just to get an idea of what she 'll be like... \n Back in the bedroom Kay helps her to dress. Guiding her frock down over her arms and playing the skirt until it stands stiff and wide. There are petticoats underneath that push it into shape and above a thin skin of peach organza with roses that you can see right through. Kay ties her sash and flicks out the bow, then slowly turns her towards the mirror. \n  'Now,'  she says,  'what do you see?'  \n  'Oh Kay...it 's so lovely.'  \n And then looking again,  'do you know? It 's the image of that frock Eileen once had. You know the one in the picture that time at the Dress Dance?'  \n  'Well, there you are,'  says Kay.  'Isn't that a coincidence?'  \n Eddie says he 'll walk back from North William St Church, because there isn't enough room in the car. But there is. Right beside her. She tries to tell him. But he doesn't seem to hear. \n And even though he walks away, his hands still in his pockets and his eyes supervising his steps, she still sits the same say, her dress bunched up into a hump. So that Eddie 's space stays vacant all the way home. \n Inside the house now and so many people. They all seem to know her, but she only knows some. Jack comes up the brown stairs, a tray over his head, shouting  'Load coming through'  again and again. And all the old Aunts laugh and say he 's a scream. There 's sherry and port wine for each of the ladies and stout for the men and whiskey as well. And each glass grows its own deep colour from stem up to brim. Bridie 's cheeks are stained with prints of strange kisses and Joe stands by her side shaking all hands and giggling out of his freshly scrubbed face. <> The tray with the meat comes up and Mr Costelloe looks down at it, grinning approval as proud as a father. And everyone says that her dress is so pretty and twirl after twirl is called for until she is dizzy. Funny though, Mr Clifford says nothing at all. \n And she looks around bursting with pride at the stacks of strange crockery on the sideboard. Oh and if only Milly would believe that they own every piece of it... \nAnd the table that Jack made is now a whole village with Bridie 's best sheets the snow on its ground. Platters of meat lie low at its centre, the square around which all else has been built. There 's mountains of bread, buttered and sliced, and big fat tomatoes heaped into hills. Skinned scallions, cleaner than she 's ever seen, sprout like trees from pint glasses. And lettuce leaves lie in hammock layers on top of four plates that stand at each corner. Small pots of thick mustard squat shoulder to shoulder. And butter tubs face them across the way. And now at last it 's time to eat, now the dishes of little beady potatoes are coming, their flaky new skin threatening to shed. \n Charlie picks up one of Mrs Dolan 's knives and spanks a glass until silence falls.  'Now,'  he says, his face all red.  'If you 'll all please help yourselves...'  \n She walks across to the window and peeps through its curtain. And why is Milly so late? Beneath her is the smaller table. Glass bowls, trifle bursting out from their rims like a fat lady 's thigh bursts out from her stocking top and pudgy sponge buns lie back and wait along cake-stands out for the day from the Boston Bakery. The box of chocolates takes up most of the space. Row after row of matt brown jewels. And Mrs Dolan is beside her saying,  'Go on. Take one. Your tongue 's hanging out.'  \n She reaches across and then remembers Kay.  'No. I 'll wait. It 's all right.'  \n Mrs Dolan starts to insist. But then Millicent Green walks right into the room and she forgets the chocolates, every last one. \n  'Oh Milly. Hello. I thought you 'd never get here.'  \n  'Mother said I must wait. Seeing as I wasn't  really  invited.'  \n  'Yes, you were so.'  \n  'Well, not to the whole thing.'  \n Milly looks cross so she says,  'Your dress is gorgeous,'  and then,  'do you like mine?'  positioning herself for yet another twirl.\n  'Not bad for a cut-off.'  \n  'What do you mean...?'  \n 'Hmmm,' Milly says,  'my mother is a dressmaker. Don't forget.'  And then walks away to peep through the adults and the table behind them. She comes back in a minute with,  'I see you have our china.'  \n  'Oh. Well, thanks for the loan.'  \n  'Oh, don't mention it. It 's not our best set.'  \n Milly is being so mean, she might not tell her about the glasses. Just arrive in with them as though they don't matter. Creak open the box and slowly take them out. Hawing the lenses and dusting them over first before inspecting them against the light. Yes, Millie can  just  wait. \n Downstairs in the kitchen Mother fits dessert dishes into each other. \n  'Where 's Eddie?'  she asks. \n  'Oh he wanted to walk.'  \n Mother looks over at the clock on the wall and frowns. \n  'I see Granny Green has arrived,'  Eileen says, pushing past her. \n  'Her name is Millicent,'  she answers back. \n She walks out to the scullery and Sheila is whispering to Lily Fossett. \n  'Bridie put them under the sofa, you see. To keep them safe. And you never guess what that drunken blaggard did?'  \n  'No, what?'  \n  'Fell asleep on the sofa. And peed in his trousers. And it dribbled down through the cushions. The chocolates were destroyed.' \n  'Oh my God. Did you throw them out?'  \n  'No. We didn't dare. After Mr Clifford buying them. Of all people ...Eileen washed them. They're upstairs on the sweet table. Just make sure you don't eat any. And here. Promise you won't tell.'  \n  'Don't be so silly. As if...'  \n She walks up the stairs and her face is on fire. How could he? The chocolates. Mr Clifford 's chocolates. Poor Mother... \n Millicent is standing in the hall.  'This is so boring,'  she says.  'They're all half piddley-eyed in there. I 'm sorry I came.' \n  'Why don't you go in and have a few chocolates?'  \n  'Where?'  Milly brightens up. \n  'Are you going to give us an oul song?'  Mrs Clancy asks and then turning to her husband,  'she 's a great little one on the pian-o.'  \n But Mrs Clancy is only saying it. Just because she knows she 's heard what she 'd really been saying. About her new glasses and her a disgrace her mother being a poor 'Wida-woman' and having to take in a lodger just to make ends meet. \n  'I don't know...'  \n  'Ah come on. What about \"All for Marie 's Wedding\"? I 've heard you play that before. You do a lovely job on it altogether.'  \n Charlie walks in then and Mrs Clancy hooks on to this elbow. \n  \"Tell her, Charlie. Tell her to play \"All for Marie 's Wedding\".'  \n  'Yes,'  he says.  'Go on. That 's your special song.'  \n  'I 'll have to get my music...' \n  'Go on then. We 'll wait. Promise. Where is it?'  \n  'In my schoolbag.'  \n No colour comes through on the skylight, now that it 's dark. She knocks at the door and slowly she opens it. The shaft from the landing makes a path for her to follow. Her hand pokes under the candlewick spread, and it rubs its gentle fleece against her arm. There she feels the bag and slides it to her. \n She hears a thud then and the shaft from the landing slithers off. \n And everything moves so slowly, it 's almost as if it 's not moving at all, as if it 's not happening. There are hands, she knows, that lift her up from the side of the bed. And at first she    thinks   it 's someone looking for another twirl. But then she feels herself flop onto the mattress and bounce softly before being slipped over onto her back. \n And then she sees him. So that 's who it is. There at the end of that outstretched arm. That 's his large hand pushing her small hands away. And pulling at her dress too, and tearing its roses that you can see right through. His second hand is a separate animal nibbling at the buttons in his trousers fly. His face is growing nearer and keeps saying shh, shh. Even though her screams are no more than a catch in her throat. \n And then her hands go all quiet on her and lie dead by her side. And why oh why would they not move? He is taking something out of his trousers now. And one knee is up on the bed and now the other is copying it. And everything so black that she cannot see. She can hear though, the shh shh and shh shh. And downstairs too the cheering and laughter and Charlie speaking thickly the words that he 's practised all week. But her breath gets so tight that the sounds fade away. And she is going to faint...just about to go when... \n Suddenly they move again, her sleeping hands. And like two little birds they curl themselves inwards and tighten for a moment before they fly upward and... \n PUNCH straight up, each taking a lens of his glasses. SMASH they both to into an instant spider 's web. And he falls backwards and stumbles to the floor. \n Her legs take her somehow over to the door and as it swings towards her the dressing-gown scrapes her face and brings her scream back to her. As though it had only been hiding. \n There 's singing downstairs and feet bangbanging on the parlour floor. Eddie sits hunched in a corner of the hall. He looks slowly up at her but then his elbow slips and his head falls back down. \n She wants to tell him. To run and shake him, to make her screams turn into words. She wants him to bash Mr Clifford before he sneaks out the back way. For already she can hear him gather his things. Eddie will get him. Eddie is the one. Sheila might kill her - the price of the glasses. And now the lodger 's money gone. What about Kay? Oh look at her dress. Her lovely organza...Oh Kay...And Mother. What would Mother say? What does she say again when she brings tales from school?  'Well you must have deserved it.'  Yes that 's what she says. \n  'Eddie,'  she shouts and her feet start to move. One step then two...But the song from the parlour makes them stop:\n Step we gaily on we go,\nHeel for heel and toe for toe.\nArm in arm and row on row... \n They are singing her song. Her special song. They started without her. As if she wasn't there. But it doesn't sound right. Something is wrong. \n She sits down on the stairs and it comes to her then. Yes, that 's it. They have changed the words. Instead of 'All for Marie 's Wedding' they were singing 'All for Bridie 's'. \n One word and now it was a different song.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "acdbb245-56c2-4693-8ebb-b4e72bb8bc7e", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.721384+00:00"}
{"text": "<After the Match>\n\n\n<$A>\n AFTER THE MATCH \n They burst into the reception hall of Old Woodleigh, fists raised in triumph, the growing  waaahh  sound which had been audible from a distance now deepening, distorting their faces as they fell  en masse  through the double doors. The opposition had been trounced in a stunning display of muscle and airborne muck at the Leinster Schools Rugby Final. \n Helen stood with Doreen and Katy, the wives of two other Bellemont teachers.  Waaahhh  ...The women shifted uncomfortably, taking pointedly casual sips from their drinks as they watched the boys close in around the two trainers. Helen studied Adam 's face. He was in seventh heaven. This was the moment when all the extra time spent training the young beasts - the late nights, the pep-talks and sessions which had intensified during the last, vital weeks - suddenly added up. She was pleased for him, the happy glow on his face some sort of pay off. \n  'Isn't if marvellous for them!'  Doreen giggled over the G and T, adjusting a frothy pink blouse at the neck as the tangle of cheering bodies suddenly shifted in their direction. \n  'Absolutely!'  Katy agreed.  'You must both be thrilled skinny.'  \n  'Oh it 's great to see them win. As a mother I know just what it means to the boys,'  Doreen said, eyes shining with pleasure. \n  'Aren't you thrilled, Helen?'  said Katy again, more for something to say than in true speculation. \n  'Delighted. Delighted,'  said Helen, distracted by the whooping and back-slapping. \n  'Of course it 's your first time so it 'll seem very new,'  Doreen whispered.  'But when Adam has worked with Patrick and brought them through like this a few more times, you 'll take it all in your stride. I know when Patrick started training I was so nervous you wouldn't believe it. I mean you want them to win, you wish so desperately for everything to work out.'  \n  'Well it has anyway.'  Helen was vague, uncertain of her humour. \n Patrick and Adam were hoisted shoulder-high, good-humouredly tolerating the heaving the jostling. The parents of the players mingled with the group, not quite at the centre of the knot of bodies but near enough to be hugged and kissed by sons who were out of their minds with joy. One of the boys forced the cup, a well-dented trophy chased in silver in gold, into Adam 's hands. \n  'Ah, lads, I can't balance!'  he shouted, raising the cup unsteadily. They roared again and took off at a lumbering gallop around the hall. \n  'Easy now lads!'  Patrick called. Nobody heard. He was older than Adam, his face finely-lined, more assured. \n Flustered helpers tried to seat the jubilant mob. Waiters and serving women signalled, ignored until a few of the parents and most of the teachers made their way to the dining area. The boys followed untidily. Helen groaned as one of them started the school rallying song again. It was rapidly taken up as they filtered through. She was starving. The afternoon on the terraces at Lansdowne had been freezing, hail and wind whipping in under the stand till they were drenched. They were proper ninnies to have taken so much trouble with their appearances, she thought, observing the other women. Like fresh, dewy flowers, individually not so interesting, but as a group colourful and strangely expectant. Like girls at their first party. The older ones were muffled in furs and fine wool. Because it was a day which had promised victory, she 'd had her hair plaited, and wore a new navy and green dress bought specially for the occasion. It had cost too much but she liked it and Adam would find the effect exotic and interesting among all the matrons. \n  'Womba, womba, womba,'   the slow chant began. She tried to look benevolent and pleasant as she took her seat and watched the team and their followers crash their way down along the tables. <italic> 'Ing-gang-oolie-oolie-oolie-oolie,'   they growled, reminding her of visiting rugby teams from New Zealand whose ritual dance was intended to intimidate the opponents. One of the boys grabbed a seat opposite her and sat down, panting. \n  'Jaysus!'  he gasped, blinking in her direction, but she realised that he wasn't looking at her so much as drifting in and out of some hallucinatory and highly-pleasured dream.  'Ing-gang-goo.'   \n To her right a restless middle-aged man with lightly-tanned skin shifted continually in his seat. \n  'Hello, I 'm Helen Kilroy.'  She introduced herself, decided she 'd best make an effort and be sociable. The bane of her life. Being sociable. Making an effort for the sake of civility. He looked at her for a moment, surprised at her presence, not expecting to be addressed. \n  'Oh. How d'you do? McElligot. Jim,'  he mumbled, extending his hand. \n  'You 've a son on the team, right?' \n  'Wrong. Nephew,'  he said, looking over her shoulder and waving at somebody. \n  'Good man Delaney! Knew you 'd do it, ya bloody hound!'  he bellowed, taking a slug from a glass of wine.   'Chow-chow-chow,'  the call went, its barking rhythm strengthening. Helen tried again. For Adam 's sake she must make an effort to be amenable. \n  'Oh yes, I remember the boy - Ciaran McElligot is your nephew.'  \n  'Got it in one!'  he said, before stopping suddenly.  'But... but...my God, I 've just realised who you are!'  He sat back, absorbing her from head to toe as if she were a vision. \n  'I do apologise Mrs Kilroy...Helen, that what you said?...The way things are today, I don't know what 's happening. Super isn't it, you must be so proud of Adam, delighted with yourself, what?'  \n  'Womba, womba, womba.'   She wondered how to counter the flood of hyperbole. How pleased did she have to be, how could she convey her pleasure, that yes, it was wonderful? \n To her left, Doreen chattered to somebody 's father. She was cut out for it, Helen thought, remembering the chocolate eclairs and apple-tarts which Doreen had ferried to the team the evening before every match.  'I really feel for them,'  she was saying, staring wide-eyed at the man.  'It 's so hard for them in a boarding-school. I find they really need something to remind them that we all care, that somebody really, really cares.'  \n  'Oh you 're quite right, quite right,'  the man replied. \n The poor bugger was bored stiff. Helen peered over Doreen 's shoulder and into his eyes. He caught the look and in the flicker of an instant almost responded, stifling a smile. She looked away then. No joy there.  Homo domesticus  if ever she saw him. Common-or-garden species. Widespread in the British Isles. Shed its inhibitions only during summer migration. Likes the company of its own sex. Probably saves his charm for the rugby tours. Miles away from solicitous wives. Still. Best not start messing. For Adam 's sake. Best behave and keep her talents for the home front or circles where they wouldn't be misinterpreted. This was no place for wit and irony. Or so much as a hint of sex.  'Yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak,'  the boys roared.  'Come on, Bellemont, win it back!'  The  'Waaaahh'  sound rose again as they finally settled down, plastic chair scraping and hacking on the wooden floor. \n Adam and Patrick sat like young bulls, penned off at the top table, surrounded by priests, the headmaster and various significant supports, including the priest who had once found her bathing naked with Adam in the school swimming-pool. Adam had been raging afterwards. Hadn't he told her not to strip, but no, she 'd insisted, determined to tease, and had even tried to rip his swimming-trunks off, just as Goggle-face walked in. The thought of it made her suddenly splutter with laughter. The McElligot man scrutinised her. \n  'God but it 's a tremendous occasion,'  he muttered to her, as if testing her sanity. \n  'God but it is,'  she replied glibly, giggling again in recollection of the priest 's bland face as she 'd waded to the side of the pool in an attempt to conceal her flesh. Word inevitably got around. A black mark. A man who couldn't control his wife in certain situations was open to question. \n During the meal, people were absorbed in the post-mortem: the earnest dissection of every moment of play, comparisons with previous finals leading to disputes, jokes, noisy debate. She could think of a million and one more interesting topics, even if it was their special rugger day. Hadn't she shown interest in other people, even in the brat sitting opposite, hadn't she tried a variety of conversational options, from current affairs to UEFA and British soccer hooligans, the Olympics? Of course it wasn't necessary to say anything to that lot. She glared balefully at her soup. More a matter of making the right sounds, little-woman chat. She listened to Doreen. \n  'Well of course education is important, it 's one of the most important things any parent can give a child!'  she was saying with vehemence. \n  'Quite. The wife and I like to take certain decisions too. All in all some guidance is needed and the discipline which rugger adds is damn well unbeatable,'  the man beside her said. \n 'Discipline?'  she cut in over Doreen 's shoulder.  'What do you mean by discipline?'  she asked, putting on an interested face, hand curling under her chin. The man looked extremely surprised. \n  'Aaah! Discipline? Discipline 's discipline any way you look at it: the boys have to be ready to forge good careers, stand up for themselves, go for it in a tough world, that type of thing...'  \n A waiter slid a plate of turkey and ham before her, then another slammed a heap of mashed potatoes and liquidised sprouts on top of the meat. \n  'You mean externalised discipline?'  Helen asked, determined to be awkward. \n  'What? Beg pardon?'  \n  'The ability to kow-tow to authority and suchlike - a bit like doing things without asking why?'  \n Doreen nodded her head in agreement and Helen was suddenly aware that she was listening intently. \n  'But what else is there?'  Doreen asked. \n The man started to hum and haw. \n  'Asking why isn't always such a bally great thing, young woman, he commented, focusing at a point beyond her. \n  'You 'd drive yourself crazy if you were constantly questioning things, Helen,'  said Doreen. \n  'Is that so?'  said Helen. \n  'Yes, and the long and the short of it for me is that they get such a lot out of the experience. It stands to them, makes...'  she searched for the word,  '...it makes men of those boys.'  \n  'Well said, well said.'  The man applauded quietly with manicured hands. \n The meal was over. There was, she thought, little so say which would have made the slightest difference. She glanced along the length of the table, making no effort to conceal an expression of boredom. Katy was chirruping with some guy from the IRFU, Doreen was flirting with the disciplinarian, McElligot brayed joyfully over his wine, his nephew smiled like an imbecile and the muscular boy opposite, who told her he was a hooker and laughed, expecting her not to understand what the term meant, rocked backwards and forwards on his chair, spooning trifle into his flaccid mouth. Adam and Patrick sat in the sanctuary of the top table. Thank God Adam wasn't a yob, one of those aleckadoos. At least the whole thing was a game for him, a sport. Rugby was rugby was rugby and if people didn't know the difference between Phase One and Phase Two possession they could forget it. Not for him the ribald tribalism that emanated from their opponents' dressing rooms prior to every match as trainers bullied mercilessly and told the team they couldn't generate a pint of piss between them. That wasn't Adam 's style. Instead, Patrick had been persuaded to adopt Adam 's half-baked meditation techniques, picked up as a result of some cursory reading and a trip to Bangkok some years back. The Bellemont boys had been ribbed mercilessly, with 'Bellemont Boys Levitate' and 'A Try for the Maharishi' lashed across the evening papers. All the more satisfying to prove them wrong, Helen thought, to see Adam have his glory. She was nothing if not loyal. \n McElligot wheeled back in his chair as the speeches began. He had reached the point of no return, and lit a cigar, his hands unsteady. The place was noisy: boys and fathers shouted and catcalled across the room; wives and mothers smiled in complicity, the  waaahh  sound threatening to erupt again until the headmaster raised his right arm in a plea for silence.", "subdomain": "IRELAND_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d0df2dc9-dc02-4c45-9f69-92b141217523", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:01.722548+00:00"}
